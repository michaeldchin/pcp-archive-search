00:00:00 Hello, everybody, and welcome to yet another Pro Crastinators Podcast interview series.
00:00:06 I am here with the one and only Hippocrit.
00:00:12 Yep, he is.
00:00:15 Hippo, um...
00:00:18 I'm curious about the fact that a lot of the time on the show, people call you Gibbon.
00:00:24 Why is this?
00:00:26 That is because it used to be our secret brony names. We all have them. That's our secret identity.
00:00:34 That's my one. I'm a Gibbon.
00:00:37 It's just my old channels. Gibbontake.youtube.com.
00:00:43 Yeah, that's really all it is. It's a nicer name to say than Hippo, so some people couldn't get into the habit of saying Hippo all the time.
00:00:54 Yeah, it's that we called you Gibbon for so long, and then you changed to Hippocrit.
00:00:58 But because you've always kept both channels active, it's kind of like how with Jesse, we all call him Jess, or we called him drowning in footwear for a long time, even though he had other channels that were even bigger.
00:01:12 Well, we called him Jesse Wood most of the time.
00:01:15 Right. But with you, it was like, because we've never called you by just your name, which if you want to let the audience know what it is, then...
00:01:24 There's other places where they can find out.
00:01:26 Oh yeah? You're going to leave it mysterious?
00:01:29 Yeah. I mean, I'm sure people know already. They can put it on that quiz.
00:01:35 Oh, was it?
00:01:36 That procrastinators quiz.
00:01:38 So yeah, we have the hardest time deciding. I usually say Hippo. Nate usually says Gibbon.
00:01:47 I think Ben usually says Hippo.
00:01:49 It really doesn't matter. People know that I'm being addressed.
00:01:53 I just wonder if it's confusing for anybody who doesn't know about your old channel, you know?
00:01:58 Yeah. Well, that's it. It's give and take. On that channel, you'll find my Brony stuff, and a huge amount of weird, crazy nonsense that may or may not be entertaining.
00:02:09 Surely you've done more weird vlogs than you have Brony content by now, right?
00:02:14 I have. I think by now it's mostly just weird shit.
00:02:19 Which is usually great. In fact, it's always great.
00:02:22 I don't know about always, but yeah, it's very experimental. I like it.
00:02:28 So how did you get your start on YouTube?
00:02:31 Well, my very start on YouTube, I think I made in like 2007 or 2008.
00:02:41 And I had Windows Movie Maker, and I made a video about putting Google images set to a Beatles song.
00:02:52 And I thought it was really cool, and my dad liked it. I don't know why I made it, but I made it, and I made a YouTube account because it was a thing.
00:02:59 And I put it on there. And that was the very beginning.
00:03:03 After that, I did a few stop motion things, and then when I really started doing stuff with the pony fandom, with all the stuff,
00:03:10 I tried doing YouTube poops at first because I was really into that.
00:03:13 They weren't that good, but I kind of laughed once.
00:03:18 And after that, I got into doing compilations, which...
00:03:24 The first compilation was like... I don't know where I came up with the idea, but it was like a summer after school,
00:03:32 and I wasn't doing anything, and I was really bored, and I was into the pony fandom, so I thought,
00:03:37 I'll just make a video of all the times every pony says no.
00:03:42 And it was a huge undertaking because they say it a lot of times, and it took a long time, and I made it,
00:03:48 and I got like thousands of subscribers within a few hours, days, and it was overwhelming.
00:03:55 And after that, I just felt like I had to continue, and I did.
00:03:59 So, when you made these compilations, every single one you made, you had to watch the entire show, right?
00:04:07 Yes. Well, I didn't have to watch the entire show. What I did...
00:04:11 I'm trying to think...
00:04:15 The way I went about it changed over time. At first, I was just going through, and I had a little notepad open,
00:04:21 like a digital notepad, and every time I'd have all the characters' names, or I would...
00:04:28 No, what I did, I went to the scripts, the online transcripts of the episodes, and I would control F for the word,
00:04:35 and then I would go to that point in the episode by memory, like when they say this line,
00:04:40 oh, I kind of know where that is, that's like five minutes in. I go in there, and then I see them say it,
00:04:45 and I pause, I tally one on the thing, and I just keep going.
00:04:50 And, yeah, it's really retarded and autistic when I think about it, but it was kind of fun.
00:04:58 I've always wondered how ridiculously familiar you got with the show through doing that.
00:05:04 Did you watch the episodes like a hundred times?
00:05:09 It sort of waded me out to... It made a very big difference in how I view or think about those episodes compared to the ones
00:05:20 that came after I stopped doing the compilations, like Season 4, because Season 4 was when I started doing the analysis,
00:05:26 and that carries its own sort of like... I remember those for having to watch them twice and think about them,
00:05:33 and the other ones I just know lots and lots of little parts of them all over the place,
00:05:38 and it's a very big disconnect from each, like Season 3 to Season 4 and then beyond.
00:05:43 Season 5 is actually the first season I feel like I watched as a guy watching the show, because of all that nonsense.
00:05:53 So, those compilations, I remember it, because I saw them from fairly early on to them being created,
00:06:01 because they would get promoted really heavily on Equestria Daily. They'd get a whole post to themselves.
00:06:07 I guess they were seen as something very valuable because of the effort that they took, or just the sheer weirdness of their existence.
00:06:15 I think what I... I was pretty happy with the fact that I had come up with this idea, because the amount of work put in,
00:06:24 I felt like nobody would go to the trouble of actually trying to compete with me, so I could just have all those posts to myself,
00:06:31 so I would just do all the words I could think of and get a billion subscribers, and it kind of worked.
00:06:36 I had like 15,000... No, that was later. I think I got to like 9,000 or something through that alone.
00:06:44 So, you actually... Among the procrastinators, you had one of the bigger pony channels, like other than me and Tom,
00:06:51 you were probably the biggest out of everybody, right?
00:06:55 At that point, yeah, I mean, T-Bap I think overtook me at one point.
00:07:01 I plateaued at... During the analysis stuff, I plateaued around 16K, or maybe 15K, and they went further.
00:07:11 So, you would do all these videos with the show, but then what really brought you to my attention was when you did the same thing
00:07:22 with actual analysis videos for the word analysis. How long did that take?
00:07:30 Oh, well, that started because I did that one compilation of all the analysis people.
00:07:37 Like, I found... It was ridiculous, because that was the biggest one, but nobody cares about it.
00:07:42 It's the one where I went through all of your videos, all of Tom's videos, all of...
00:07:47 Basically, like a hundred different people, maybe. I looked into all of their videos and watched all of them,
00:07:54 and since there wasn't any transcripts, I had to literally watch every single video.
00:07:58 I think I'd tell you... I can't remember how long it was, but it was... Maybe not thousands of hours.
00:08:03 Hundreds of hours of watching these shitty videos, and after that, I did the analysis assemblage thing.
00:08:13 So, I already knew about a lot of these people, so I could just sort of go,
00:08:17 uh, okay, I guess I'll get all the opinions of everybody together, because usually people say the same thing over and over,
00:08:27 and if I can get the unique parts of everybody's conversation, it could be an interesting thing.
00:08:31 It kind of was, but probably not really that much.
00:08:34 Well, I was first referring to the one that was just analysis, analysis, analysis, the compilation,
00:08:38 where it was every time anyone used the word analysis in an analysis video, and you compiled them all,
00:08:47 and I had like 150-something uses or something like that, like some ridiculous number, right?
00:08:54 Yeah.
00:08:55 Like I said it fucking constantly, and it was really funny, and I remember taking it
00:09:03 and setting it to like this insane, like, noise song that like me and Victor had put together,
00:09:09 and just like put that over it, and it was like, did you put it after dark?
00:09:12 I remember seeing that, I remember seeing that and being really, really happy that you had enjoyed it that much.
00:09:19 Yeah, it was great.
00:09:21 And then, yeah, and then after that you started, it was with season four, right, that you did the analysis assemblage,
00:09:26 where it was like taking everyone's, a new episode would come out, everyone would release a video,
00:09:31 and then you would assemble all the best points they made into a video, right?
00:09:36 Is that how you'd put it?
00:09:38 Assembling all the different points, like if people were arguing with each other, I would bring up each other's topics,
00:09:44 but really they're not very, the people coming up with things is like, there's only so many ways you can view a certain episode,
00:09:54 and it's, yeah, I got bored of it pretty quickly.
00:09:59 So then you decided to throw your hat into doing it yourself, doing analysis videos.
00:10:03 Yeah, which was much more fun, because it was me, and I'm important, and I'm cool.
00:10:08 And the way I remember the trajectory going was that at first you were trying more to be like an analysis guy,
00:10:16 and then very quickly you seemed to stop caring about that angle and wanted to just do jokes,
00:10:21 and they became much more comedy oriented.
00:10:24 Yeah, I think it was the Christmas one or something, like it was over Christmas,
00:10:29 and I hadn't done the video because it was Christmas time and stuff was happening,
00:10:33 so I was like, ugh, I don't know, blah blah blah, and it was hilarious, and I really liked it, and everyone really liked it,
00:10:38 so I just thought I'd be more funny instead of caring too much about reviewing the show.
00:10:44 And then Jesse, I found Jesse's videos, and he introduced me to all different types of ways of being a brony
00:10:56 and enjoying the show and hating everyone, and that was cool.
00:11:00 So that sort of became the second wave, and then I died.
00:11:05 What was it?
00:11:09 I know that I knew about you, but how did Jesse find out about you,
00:11:13 because I assume you would have said something about him at some point to draw his attention.
00:11:18 I think Jesse had seen that I had mentioned him in one of my first analysis assemblage videos,
00:11:25 so he noticed that. I don't think he had talked to me then, but I think I talked to you.
00:11:32 I remember when I first became Skype friends with you, we were playing that MMO, the Pony MMO, what Legends of Equestria,
00:11:40 and I saw you in the game, and I was like, holy shit, it's him, so I'll see if I can be friends,
00:11:47 and I jumped onto a video you were making, and then after that...
00:11:53 For anyone, I don't expect anyone to track this down, but me and this dude, DJ Calcos, had done...
00:12:00 It was like, did you and Calcos do Equestria? We were playing the betas of this, or alpha rather, of this Pony MMO that they were making,
00:12:07 and the second video we did, we just happened to run into give and take, but you didn't have a mic, so we were just kind of like,
00:12:13 just showing you in the video.
00:12:15 I think I did have a mic.
00:12:16 Did you? I don't remember you saying anything in the video.
00:12:18 I didn't say much, that was the thing, I was like really nervous, like holy shit, he's an internet celebrity,
00:12:24 and I'm being with him, it's cool, and I'm scared.
00:12:28 But I do remember that, that was probably the first thing we had that was like a collaboration in any way.
00:12:35 Yeah, and then what happened after that? I think, Jesse, I think I talked to you about making the Faggot compilation,
00:12:45 because I found out about Jesse through you, and I looked at all these videos, I thought this guy's great,
00:12:51 I'll do a compilation to get his attention, and I told you about it, and I told you not to tell him, because I knew you were friends with him,
00:12:58 and then I made it, and he saw it, and it was cool, and I think I added him on Skype somehow.
00:13:03 That's still up, right on, give and take?
00:13:06 Yeah.
00:13:07 Yeah, go to give and take and look up the Faggot Faggot compilation, every time Jesse says Faggot in any of his videos.
00:13:16 That was great, and you even, how did you get his older stuff, because you had the Tucker Todd Ferguson character,
00:13:24 you had the stuff from videos that are no longer on his channel.
00:13:29 I think, I went to his Blip channel, actually, and I found, like his old Final Fantasy 7 Let's Play,
00:13:36 and I battled Toads and Double Dragon Let's Play, and I looked through all those, and the old school podcast with,
00:13:42 No, what was it?
00:13:44 There's a Johnny Old School, and his friends, those games, that podcast.
00:13:49 Aiden, and Cinemascist.
00:13:53 Yeah, I listened to those, and I basically just, I actually went on his Facebook account,
00:14:00 I typed in his name, I found him on Facebook, and I got an image that I used for the thumbnail.
00:14:05 So I really, I basically stalked everything I could find of Jesse, just so I could make that video.
00:14:11 Yeah.
00:14:12 It was cool.
00:14:13 And it was good.
00:14:15 So yeah, I guess that's probably when we all started talking, because at some point we all did a horse cast together,
00:14:21 where we brought you, or first it was that you and him did one because I was gone,
00:14:27 and he wanted to do a podcast, and then the three of us did one together before we brought in T-Bap,
00:14:32 and became the horseshoe crew.
00:14:34 So, yeah.
00:14:36 And then, I think that first podcast with me and Jesse was really awkward.
00:14:41 It was pretty bad.
00:14:43 I remember listening to it, because I was at my girlfriend's house at the time, and that's why I couldn't be on.
00:14:49 And it came out, and I listened to it at some point, and I was just like, what the fuck are they talking about?
00:14:56 It was like 40 minutes and lots of pauses, and like a long period of time between dialogue.
00:15:03 See, I didn't expect that, because I didn't think of Jesse as like a quiet person like me,
00:15:08 but if you think about how we act in the procrastinators' podcasts, we are the guys who say nothing for a long time,
00:15:14 and then chip in with a little thing.
00:15:17 I've always said that.
00:15:19 Only us in a podcast is a fucking nightmare.
00:15:22 Yeah, I mean if you listen to it, if you listen to any of the old horse casts,
00:15:26 I was always talking way more than Jesse.
00:15:29 I would just go on and on and on, and then he would come up with a big point,
00:15:34 and it's like the stuff he says is more memorable, but if you actually listen to it, it's like mostly me.
00:15:39 And I really don't think it was until the blue glow that I ever felt like Jesse could just go on by himself, you know?
00:15:47 And like the early blue glows have way more editing, where like he has to cut a lot more,
00:15:51 and now he's gotten better at just like stream of consciousness talking,
00:15:54 so I definitely think it's a skill he's developed, but at the time, not so much.
00:16:03 Stream of consciousness talking is fun.
00:16:05 Yeah.
00:16:06 It's hard to get going.
00:16:07 I can occasionally do it on my own gaming channel that I have, but I haven't been using it recently.
00:16:12 Yeah, GivenGaming.org.
00:16:17 I very much enjoyed your Dark Souls 2 videos on Given Gaming.
00:16:20 It's just the most spiteful, angry, even more so than mine, because mine are more bitchy.
00:16:28 Yours are just like, I hate the world.
00:16:31 It feels so raw and real.
00:16:34 Yeah, what was I doing?
00:16:37 I was killing what I didn't realize was like the second to last boss of the game,
00:16:41 and I was just running back down through that dark cavern and going insane because they were annoying.
00:16:48 That's a good video, even though it's kind of shitty looking.
00:16:52 The one I remember more is the Aldi is Keep one where you're just like,
00:16:56 you hadn't realized yet that you were playing with the covenant that makes the game three times harder,
00:17:03 and you're just so mad, and I was watching you like, this looks like,
00:17:08 just getting my blood boiling, this game is so fucking bad.
00:17:12 It was a direct result of those videos of yours that I ended up trying to do my own Dark Souls 2 videos,
00:17:18 because it reignited my hatred for that game, and I was like,
00:17:23 somebody's got to do it, someone's got to kill it, but then my videos were stupid.
00:17:29 Just so people know, I did beat the game on that difficulty setting, because I was like, fuck it,
00:17:35 I've gone this far, I don't care anymore, and I killed them.
00:17:39 At level 180, I want to say, that you beat the game at.
00:17:44 And you're generally great at Dark Souls, like Dark Souls 1, right?
00:17:50 Yeah, I am infamous among a few people that I killed Onstein and Smo, and Manus,
00:18:00 no, not Manus, Artorias on my first try through the game,
00:18:04 and my brother can vouch for that because he was watching me, and he was like, holy shit, you did it.
00:18:09 Because you leveled your endurance to a comically high degree, right?
00:18:15 You did insane grinding or something like that?
00:18:18 I don't know whether I leveled my endurance so much, I think I was just using fat rolls and wearing really strong armor,
00:18:25 and had a lot of health, but yeah, there was a point in fighting Artorias for the first time,
00:18:31 he hit me with one of his charging attacks, and I was drinking Maestus, and I didn't get knocked down,
00:18:36 and I thought that was worth mentioning to you guys.
00:18:39 And you were like, what?
00:18:41 I blew my mind into a thousand tiny pieces, and now you do challenge runs all the time, right?
00:18:50 Oh yeah, I did a challenge run of endurance by leveling just endurance,
00:18:56 which is actually not that difficult because it makes sure that you can roll all the time,
00:19:01 and you have really good shield usage, so you could, at the end of the game with 99 endurance,
00:19:09 I could wear the entire Giants set plus 5, and I could do fast rolls, and it was really cool.
00:19:17 That is fucking intense.
00:19:19 Yeah, and after that I started doing a Faith one, which I leveled only Faith to 99,
00:19:27 which actually was also not so bad after I got to level 70 in Faith,
00:19:32 because then I got this thing, the Wrath of the Gods, which is like an area of effect,
00:19:37 blasts that damages things, and so I could run into that little place in the painted world of Ariamis with all the slime guys,
00:19:47 and I could blow them up, and kill them all at once, and then run back, and just grind like that.
00:19:52 That sounds beautiful.
00:19:54 It was.
00:19:56 It sounds like a, like a, like a, I don't know, what's a phrase that means really good thing?
00:20:05 A true complete mental play.
00:20:09 So, um.
00:20:11 It's Sublime.
00:20:13 So Hippo, you are a man of many interesting talents.
00:20:19 I am.
00:20:20 Besides being a funny man, a punmeister for sure,
00:20:26 someone whose Twitter is nothing but weird puns and fucking bizarre jokes,
00:20:32 and general comedic guy, YouTuber, but you're also a musician, yeah?
00:20:39 Yeah.
00:20:41 I've never been in a sort of a professional band sort of thing,
00:20:45 but I play guitar, and I can play bass and drums, and stuff.
00:20:51 I very rarely play keyboards, but I can.
00:20:55 But guitar is my main thing, and I'm pretty good at it.
00:20:58 Haven't you played at a few live shows, like with your dad?
00:21:02 Oh yeah, I played with, my dad's a drummer, my dad's cool.
00:21:06 He's a drummer, and he drums in a band, two bands.
00:21:10 There's a band that he formed with dads from my old school,
00:21:14 and they called it Dad's Own, and then there's a band that he had with this jazz band he was in.
00:21:22 I don't know whether he's in that anymore, but yeah.
00:21:25 And he had like two pretty good bands that I've been listening to recently, actually,
00:21:30 because he's got all these old cassettes of his, like, studio recordings and stuff,
00:21:35 and I've been going through them, and recording them onto, you know, big...
00:21:39 I've got this, like, cassette to a USB thing, so I can download them and make them digital for them.
00:21:45 And yeah.
00:21:46 Cool.
00:21:47 So yeah, I've played in a few live bands.
00:21:50 I'm actually going to be playing in a live rock concert at Aguna Re, which is a whole other thing.
00:21:56 Aguna Re is this camp for disabled kids, where I volunteer and help and stuff.
00:22:04 And this year, we've organized a rock concert, and I'm going to be playing a bunch of rock songs for them.
00:22:10 And that's cool.
00:22:11 Nice.
00:22:12 So yeah.
00:22:13 You can play a lot of classic dad rock.
00:22:19 Yeah, I like all that sort of stuff.
00:22:22 Whenever we talk music in the PCP, Hippo has very specific tastes.
00:22:27 You like the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd.
00:22:32 What are some others?
00:22:35 Queen, David Bowie.
00:22:38 I mean, there's loads.
00:22:40 Whenever I think of, like, a list of bands, I forget all of them.
00:22:44 ACDC is a pretty good one.
00:22:47 But anything that's cool.
00:22:50 Yeah, cool.
00:22:51 And from the 70s or early 80s or 60s, I guess.
00:22:56 I like rock from any time period.
00:23:03 I mean, Muse is one of my favorite bands, and they're still going strong.
00:23:07 They're one of the biggest bands in the world at the moment.
00:23:10 But I'm not very much into weird indie shit like you are, I guess.
00:23:17 You seem to like guitar-driven rock, stuff where the guitars are prominent.
00:23:23 And generally, it usually is massively popular just by happenstance.
00:23:30 Right.
00:23:34 In the procrastinator's discord room, we have our PCP channel,
00:23:40 and then we have the musical corner.
00:23:42 And every so often, Hippo will just pop into the musical corner
00:23:46 and start playing a bunch of, like, Beatles and Led Zeppelin songs on his acoustic guitar.
00:23:51 And we'll just come in and listen to him.
00:23:53 And it's like, it's the most relaxing possible experience in the world.
00:24:00 I'm glad you like it.
00:24:01 I didn't expect that to be cool, but I guess it is.
00:24:04 Yeah.
00:24:05 I made that corner, I don't know why, really.
00:24:08 I guess I was just, like, imagining me playing for you guys or something over the internet.
00:24:13 But I assumed the internet would make it all annoying to listen to, like with lag and stuff.
00:24:19 I mean, it sounds like shit, but it's still fun to listen to.
00:24:22 It's kind of like, I mean, I mean, I listen to a lot of shitty sounding music, you know?
00:24:29 Like, I listen to a lot of black metal, which is deliberately recorded badly for the atmosphere.
00:24:34 So to me, it kind of has this atmosphere of, like, it sounds like if you were outside,
00:24:41 next to a babbling brook, and someone about 30 feet away was playing acoustic guitar,
00:24:47 and you're just hearing the acoustic guitar mixed in with all the other atmospheric noise,
00:24:52 then that's kind of what it sounds like.
00:24:55 But with, like, weird digital pop in and pop out.
00:24:59 So it's like all of that, but it's inside the internet.
00:25:02 It's like a cyberpunk future thing.
00:25:05 It's an electronic babbling brook.
00:25:07 Yeah.
00:25:08 Yeah, that's nice.
00:25:10 There's going to be a VR future where we can actually make that exact scenario I described happen.
00:25:17 So what would you say is your outright favorite band, Beatles or Led Zeppelin, or something else?
00:25:26 It's usually Led Zeppelin, but I don't really like having a favorites.
00:25:32 I like having a ton of favorites.
00:25:34 I don't like choosing one out of all of them, because it depends on what I feel like listening to,
00:25:39 and how long it's been since I've listened to my quote-unquote favorite.
00:25:44 Do you have a favorite song to play?
00:25:50 I have quite a lot of songs I've learned to play, and I can't remember my favorite one.
00:25:55 I guess at the moment it's back in black by AC DC, because that riff is really cool.
00:26:00 That's the one that's like...
00:26:09 You saw them recently with Axl Rose as the lead singer?
00:26:14 Yeah, the guy, what's his name?
00:26:17 I've only gotten into AC DC recently.
00:26:20 I knew they were cool, but I only started listening to them recently, so I don't know the guy's name.
00:26:25 It was sick, and Axl Rose was singing for him, and I went to see him live at the London Olympic Stadium.
00:26:32 Well, the beginning of the month.
00:26:34 It was really good. They had cannons and a giant fat inflatable lady, and a giant cool bell that was tolling.
00:26:44 It was the hell's bells it was. It was great.
00:26:47 What were the cannons shooting?
00:26:50 Blanks, hopefully.
00:26:54 I saw a Coldplay show once, and they had cannons that shot confetti out over the audience.
00:27:02 That's a fake cannon. These were real cannons, because they were actually super loud.
00:27:07 Oh, full-sized cannons.
00:27:09 There were like nine of them, and that was the finale.
00:27:12 For those about to rock, we salute you. Boom!
00:27:15 It's like, whoa! It's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
00:27:18 That's fucking intense. That's awesome.
00:27:24 So, yeah, your dad performed in these bands. You are a musician.
00:27:29 Both of your brothers are musicians, too, right, on some level?
00:27:33 Yeah, well, my brother, Henry, is kind of a budding bassist, but he hasn't really been getting into it as much as my other brother, Charlie,
00:27:44 who got really into ragtime music, you know, all that sort of stuff you see in, like, YouTube videos where they're trying to be old-timey, and they stock ragtime music.
00:27:56 He actually knows how to play all that on the piano, which is really cool.
00:28:00 And then he got into a lot of Motown and stuff, Stevie Wonder and David Bowie, and he knows a lot of cool shit, and he's good.
00:28:10 He's really good at it. He's good at piano, he's good at bass.
00:28:14 He's going to be playing with me in that rock concert.
00:28:17 To ask you more, like, who are your brothers? How old are they, and what do they do?
00:28:22 Because they're fairly interesting as well.
00:28:26 They are. Well, fairly. Henry's two years old, younger than me, so he'd be 20, I think, and Charlie is my youngest brother.
00:28:39 He's the piano guy, and he is 19, I guess. I can't remember.
00:28:44 I mean, I don't pay too much attention to their literal age, I just know when their birthday is.
00:28:51 But yeah, Henry's actually kind of a neat at the moment, but he's cool.
00:28:59 I mean, he's not depressed or anything. He's got his new room and stuff.
00:29:04 He's just not doing shit.
00:29:07 Yeah, he's not doing much, but it's okay. I believe in him.
00:29:12 One of them has a YouTube channel, right?
00:29:15 That's Henry. He's got a little YouTube channel. He puts some confessional sort of things, not too in-depth,
00:29:24 but it's interesting to listen to from my perspective, because it's the sort of thing he doesn't say to me directly all that much.
00:29:32 And some other weird stuff.
00:29:36 And he's worked on some of your weird-ass give-and-take videos, like holding the camera.
00:29:42 Yeah, he's usually the cameraman when I need one. He's up for all that sort of stuff.
00:29:48 He likes my channel. He likes all the procrastinators.
00:29:50 I've actually gotten him into the PCP procrastinated podcast has allowed him to get into everybody who, you know,
00:29:58 into Jesse, into you, into Davoo, into all the other guys. He likes them all.
00:30:03 And through Nate, he's actually started watching anime, starting with Gurren Lagann.
00:30:08 And he's the one who dressed up as Bloodborne, right?
00:30:14 Yeah, he likes buying really cool outfits that he never wears, because he never goes anywhere.
00:30:23 The fucking Bloodborne thing came out of no ways.
00:30:27 You just came into my room dressed like that, and you said, oh, and I was like, oh, shit, I'll get a bit of fullness.
00:30:34 Whenever I see you guys' videos, I feel like you communicate largely through laughs.
00:30:39 We do. You know, it's weird, because it's hard to explain an example.
00:30:48 But say, for example, there's dinner is coming, dinner time. Mom calls up the stairs and only I hear it.
00:30:55 So I go to the door, I open it, and I go, yeah, and then they know exactly what to do.
00:30:59 They just come out. It's not like, yeah, is the word.
00:31:03 It's just the fact that I came to the door and didn't say anything of worth means that it's dinner time.
00:31:07 I know exactly what you're talking about, because I'll go into Victor or Shadesbury would just be like,
00:31:13 just peek open the door, and I was like, yeah.
00:31:18 And they'll be like, yeah, and I'm like, yeah.
00:31:22 And they're like, what do you want?
00:31:26 Oh, there's food. That often happens. I know.
00:31:29 That's cool.
00:31:32 Oh, man. Little brothers. It's fun that we're both, me, you, and DeVoo are all the eldest of three siblings.
00:31:43 Oh, yeah. I think Ben is too.
00:31:47 I meant to ask Nate this when I finally get to his interview, because I'm pretty sure they have a sister that Ben just never brought up in his interview.
00:31:56 Yeah, I don't know why they don't talk about it at all.
00:31:59 Yeah, we never mention her. I don't know the first thing about her.
00:32:04 Apparently she's a tattoo artist.
00:32:07 Oh, yeah, I do know that because Nate said it on Twitter the other day.
00:32:11 But enough about them. This is your fucking interview.
00:32:16 So do you have any plans with your musical career?
00:32:20 You have a band camp, which probably not a lot of people know about, but it has some great songs like Chicken and a Basketball.
00:32:28 That's a fan favorite.
00:32:30 Yeah, Ben loves that fucking song and he always brings it up.
00:32:35 You recently did a rap song about being sick, and that was fucking...
00:32:41 I did a whole album about being sick. I was sick.
00:32:45 And for seven days or so, I think I recorded a song in whatever state I was, and I got worse over the course of the album, and then I got better by the end, and it was really cool.
00:32:55 And it just so happened to end on the day Homestuck ended.
00:32:59 Which has nothing to do with it, but it's cool.
00:33:02 It was completely disgusting, but great in that way.
00:33:07 It was the kind of thing where I was listening to it and I was like, oh no, yeah.
00:33:16 What is the band camp's URL anyways?
00:33:21 I think it's just a hypocrite, like one word, band camp slash hypocrite, I don't know.
00:33:29 You can find it, not too hard. I think I've got it linked on one of my channels.
00:33:35 But yeah, go check that out. There's not too many songs and some of them are pretty good.
00:33:40 I think from the sick album, I'm a piece of shit, it was pretty good. A lot of people like that.
00:33:50 So then, aside from music and YouTube, you also are an animator.
00:33:58 That's what you actually just finished college for, right? You got your degree?
00:34:02 Yeah, I got my degree in animation. I'm an animator. I make things removed.
00:34:08 Is that an associate bachelor's degree, right?
00:34:10 Bachelor's, yeah.
00:34:12 And you made this great student film, Spiders or People 2, which is currently up on Gibb and Take, I think.
00:34:22 Everyone watched that. It's fucking great. I watched it again and I liked it just as much as the first time.
00:34:29 Yeah, I like all the student films I've made. I'm pretty proud of them.
00:34:35 I'm not sure about animation in general, though. I'm good at it, but I'm not a fucking fine artist when it comes to animation.
00:34:45 I can make them and they're fun, but they take a long time.
00:34:50 I'm going to be doing more animation, I think. I've got a potential documentary thing I'm doing.
00:34:58 My parents are probably going to be looking for work for me, which is nice of them, but I don't know.
00:35:04 I think in the case of your animation, personally, I'm less impressed with the animation as I am with the directing of the animation, where your comedic timing is always perfect.
00:35:17 Yeah, everybody has always said that. My comedic timing in editing is my strongest point, and it's true. I know when to start a joke.
00:35:28 And also just knowing the storyboarding element. I don't know if you actually storyboard them, but they're very coherent and easy to follow in a way that I think is incredible.
00:35:41 It's amazing to me that you did everything on Spiders of People, too, because a lot of skillsets went into that. Even the sound effects are great.
00:35:52 Yeah, I guess I'm good at sound design as well. I don't know how. I picked it up and I'm good at noticing when a shot is good and using it in my own stuff, but I don't really go over the storyboards too many times to get them perfect.
00:36:13 Let's do it from over the shoulder, or behind the thing, or from a weird wide angle, I don't know. And it usually works out really well, so I guess I just have a knack for that as well. It's good. I'm good at it.
00:36:31 I agree.
00:36:33 So I would say that this also applies to the live-action segments of your videos. I always find them to be highly inventive and entertaining, and you do lots of little stop-motion stuff.
00:36:55 I think when I look at your videos versus, like, let's say John Tron, whom I know you're in my camp of thinking he's totally gone to shit.
00:37:05 John Tron?
00:37:06 Yeah, right?
00:37:08 Oh, sorry, you cut out while you said John Tron. I thought you didn't say his name.
00:37:12 I was saying that you're in my camp of thinking John Tron's gone to shit, right?
00:37:17 Yeah, yeah.
00:37:18 But he was a huge influence on you.
00:37:20 He was a very huge influence. I mean, the idea that he had started in 2010, and at the time, like, everybody who was big had started, like, as soon as YouTube had started.
00:37:32 And he started in 2010, and he got that big. I was like, whoa, you can still just start whenever you need to, and if you're good, you'll make it.
00:37:40 So, yeah. And he was, like, the best I had seen, aside from AVGN, and I really wanted to...
00:37:48 It rekindled my desire to be one of those guys, because I always thought I wanted to, but I sort of fell out of the idea once I realized how difficult it would be to begin at this stage.
00:38:02 Yeah.
00:38:03 But, I mean, I'm still beginning, kind of, but I'm doing okay. I'll get there.
00:38:09 So, the reason I brought John Tron up is that, like, he's got these videos now where you can take one look at it at any shot, and you'd be like, oh, this is shot on a nice camera.
00:38:20 The sets look expensive. You know, it's, like, quote-unquote, high effort.
00:38:25 But I think the writing and delivery of the jokes is always just kind of, like, whatever.
00:38:30 And when I think of, like, a great use of effort, I think of the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone opening, where there's a part where, like,
00:38:38 like a hooded cape, like, stop motion animates onto your body.
00:38:45 It looks amazing.
00:38:47 That wasn't stop motion. That was just me filming it in reverse. Well, I filmed it falling off me, and then I did it in reverse.
00:38:54 Oh, okay.
00:38:55 It looked like it was just flying up into me.
00:38:57 Yeah.
00:38:58 It looks hilarious, though. And, like, you've done a lot of tricks like that where you really just do something inventive with the camera.
00:39:06 Lots of green screen, especially all the weird shit on Give and Take.
00:39:10 Like, most of those videos is, like, you had one idea of a cool thing to do with a camera and base the whole video around that, and it's...
00:39:18 I'm always like, man, that's fucking ingenious. Why didn't I think of doing something like that, you know?
00:39:24 Yeah. Really, Give and Take is my experimental grounds, and if something really works, then I'll try and use it in a Hippocrite video.
00:39:32 Yeah.
00:39:33 Yeah, I like doing weird shit with the camera.
00:39:37 It's funny, because all that sort of skit stuff, I never really plan it.
00:39:42 I sort of just say, alright, I know what the voiceover is going to be in the script, and I have ideas for, like, what the slapstick will be in the skit.
00:39:51 But I don't know how I'm going to film it until I'm there, and I tell my brother, alright, stand here, and sort of zoom in as I say this, and then he does.
00:39:59 And then we look at it, and it's like, yeah, that's good, alright, let's make the next thing.
00:40:03 And then I go into the editing thing, and everything looks pretty good.
00:40:06 And even when it doesn't, I can sort of make it look good with, you know, fast cuts and stuff.
00:40:11 Right.
00:40:12 It's fun.
00:40:14 The whole Sly Cooper live-action skit where you break into, like, the, what was it, a museum, that felt so real.
00:40:24 Because it was just your brother who was dressed up as a guard, right?
00:40:29 But he had, like, a legit, is that one of the random outfits he buys?
00:40:33 Like, did he just have that?
00:40:35 I think he just had some cool black gloves, and that made him look official, and some, like, combat, like, black combat trousers.
00:40:43 And he had this weird hook that came off of wardrobe, and he stuck it in his pocket, and on the hook, we put these iron, wrought iron keys that I bought, like, at a souvenir at a castle once.
00:40:53 And it just looked, it was just perfect.
00:40:56 I had this walking stick as a hook, as a cane, and I got him.
00:41:02 Apparently, people went up to him thinking that he was a real bodyguard, and just saying, no, it's just, it's nothing, I'm no one.
00:41:11 That's fantastic.
00:41:13 Like, I really appreciate that kind of stuff, because, you know, I made all those old Project Awesomeness videos, as you've seen, where we really would just, like, take whatever was lying around.
00:41:22 Whatever was lying around the house, and, like, that's our props.
00:41:25 And if you can use those, and make it still look good, and communicate the point, then to me it's even funnier than, like, having the real thing, you know?
00:41:35 Yeah.
00:41:37 It's that sort of, like, homemade quality that, you know, Jon Tron's lacking at the moment.
00:41:44 He's got all this cool stuff, and it's like, okay, you know, it would have been funnier if...
00:41:50 You cut out.
00:41:52 I can't hear you anymore.
00:41:54 Oh no, you're cutting out.
00:41:55 Cut out what happened.
00:41:56 My computer's weird.
00:41:58 So you have this strong fixation on the PlayStation 2, it seems.
00:42:04 What's up with that?
00:42:05 Yeah, it's my, it's my favorite console of all time.
00:42:08 All the best games are on it.
00:42:10 And it, it's the best, it's the best one.
00:42:12 All, all, all of them suck except that one.
00:42:15 Was that your first console, or did you have one before it?
00:42:20 No, I had a PS, PlayStation 1, but I didn't have many, very many games for it.
00:42:25 The PlayStation 2 was when it all sort of got knocked into 12th gear.
00:42:31 And I got all my favorite games were on that.
00:42:35 And then the real reason I think I like the PlayStation 2 so much, or rather that I base my channel off of it,
00:42:42 is because not many people make PS2-based videos, and if they do, they're not very good.
00:42:48 Like there's not a Jon Tron off the PS2 area.
00:42:51 So I am that guy.
00:42:52 Yeah.
00:42:53 Which is odd to think about, but it's, it's true.
00:42:56 Like there's a lot of, like when I got into those, those people like Jon Tron and AVGN,
00:43:01 like I had never played those old games.
00:43:04 So to me it was like, they're talking about a forgotten era.
00:43:07 Like it didn't even occur to me that those were games they actually grew up with.
00:43:11 It's like, I thought they were going back to like before they're even their own time.
00:43:17 Because for me, like PS2 would be, like your videos are like,
00:43:21 gonna take me back to the past.
00:43:23 Like that's how I feel.
00:43:25 Watching Ratchet and Clank.
00:43:26 I'm like, oh Ratchet and Clank, that's, I remember, I was a lad, you know.
00:43:35 Um.
00:43:36 Yeah.
00:43:37 So.
00:43:38 I like, I like all that nostalgic stuff.
00:43:40 Yeah.
00:43:41 And also the PS3 sucks.
00:43:42 That's another thing.
00:43:43 I wanted you to get into that because what is it about everything after the PS2
00:43:48 that you hate besides the Souls games?
00:43:51 Well, what, oh yeah, the Souls games are great.
00:43:55 But I think it was mostly, it was a lot of things.
00:43:59 One of the things was that all my favorite franchises had either been dropped
00:44:05 or replaced with something that sucked, like Uncharted.
00:44:09 Jack was better than Uncharted.
00:44:11 But there's other things like the new Ratchet and Clank game on PS3 wasn't that good
00:44:17 and it ended on a cliffhanger that annoyed me.
00:44:20 And in general, AAA gaming at that time felt more like,
00:44:26 let's see how realistic we can make everything,
00:44:28 rather than let's have a fun, cool world where you can do things.
00:44:31 Right.
00:44:32 Like, I don't know.
00:44:34 It just felt like all my favorite things about the PS2, the colors, the stuff,
00:44:40 the cool characters, the wacky worlds, that was seen as childish.
00:44:45 And now we've got to be making lens flares and shadows that look really pixely
00:44:51 when you look at them, but they're sort of moving, so it's cool.
00:44:54 It's all about the lighting effects and the rendering, and I didn't care for it.
00:44:58 And I just sort of grew out of playing games for a long time.
00:45:04 Yeah.
00:45:05 Yeah.
00:45:06 And since then, you've sort of, like, what games have you liked since the PS2 era?
00:45:13 I've liked plenty of games since the PS2 era.
00:45:16 I think after I got annoyed with the PS3, I sort of went to the DS,
00:45:20 and I played DS games and stuff.
00:45:23 But in console games, it was really just been Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Demon Souls.
00:45:30 I really have had, like, a lot.
00:45:32 They're cool things.
00:45:33 And it's been a long time had it in my head that, to me, the DS was, by far,
00:45:38 the best console for games over the last generation.
00:45:42 Because it really did follow up with the PS2.
00:45:45 The PS2 had an unbelievably huge library of tons of totally unique games,
00:45:50 and the DS had the same.
00:45:52 It had this unbelievably large library of great games.
00:45:55 It's like the best-selling console of all time, but no one talks about it.
00:45:59 It's got Phoenix Wright.
00:46:00 It's got Professor Layden.
00:46:01 Yeah.
00:46:02 Goddamn.
00:46:03 Goddamn things on it.
00:46:04 I think it's a combination of no one knowing how to capture from the DS.
00:46:08 I think that's really hamstrung it from being talked about in games media.
00:46:14 It's so hard to take footage from it and talk about it.
00:46:19 I feel like whenever someone talks about Phoenix Wright,
00:46:22 I know tons of Phoenix Wright fans, but I've seen no Phoenix Wright analysis videos,
00:46:27 with the exception of the one you did on Professor Layton versus Phoenix Wright.
00:46:31 How the fuck did you capture footage for that?
00:46:33 Did you steal it all?
00:46:34 Well, I stole it all.
00:46:38 I either filmed my DS with a camera, or I stole it,
00:46:43 because that's the easiest way to do things.
00:46:46 I don't want to ruin my DS just so I can capture footage.
00:46:50 And even if you get a DS emulator, you still have to fill half the screen with the text box,
00:46:57 and it's weird to put on a YouTube video.
00:46:59 Yeah.
00:47:00 It really works.
00:47:01 It's terrible for filming.
00:47:04 But I do think it had a fuckload of great games,
00:47:08 but they're on the DS, and it pisses me off that they're not all on the Wii U.
00:47:13 If I were the president of Nintendo, I would have said,
00:47:17 hey, we just made a console with two screens, and one's a touchscreen.
00:47:21 Let's make the entire library of the DS available on it,
00:47:25 and it would be worth owning a Wii U just for that,
00:47:28 just to have all the DS games available,
00:47:30 because that's the biggest fucking library of great games of the last 10 years.
00:47:35 I would buy that, even if it was like $200.
00:47:39 Yeah.
00:47:40 What's more than $200?
00:47:41 It's probably $300, but it's worth it.
00:47:46 I bought a PS4, and there were no games for it,
00:47:49 and yet I managed to buy a bunch of games.
00:47:53 I bought a PS4.
00:47:54 I bought a Bloodborne machine, too.
00:47:56 Yeah.
00:47:57 I think I talked you into it, right?
00:47:58 Like, I goaded you and Jesse into it.
00:48:00 I think I just wanted to play Bloodborne in general, but yeah.
00:48:04 Have you used it for anything other than Bloodborne?
00:48:06 Oh, wait, no.
00:48:08 The one reason that I actually went over and bought things other than Bloodborne
00:48:13 is that I learned that Dark Cloud was coming onto it as an HD,
00:48:18 and I bought the HD Dark Cloud, and it's great.
00:48:21 I love it.
00:48:22 The only thing that's wrong with that port or version of Dark Cloud
00:48:27 is that the main theme that plays, for some reason,
00:48:31 I don't know how they fucked it up, but there's like one drum in the beat.
00:48:36 I guess it's like a MIDI track or something,
00:48:38 but there's one drum that's just out of time with the rest of the thing,
00:48:41 and it keeps getting faster and slower, and it's like,
00:48:43 no, guy, you're ruining it.
00:48:45 You're ruining the song.
00:48:46 It's supposed to be the cool bit, because it plays at the title screen,
00:48:50 and then later, like in the last bus, where you're in the Sun Giant,
00:48:54 and you're fighting the Dark Genie in space,
00:48:57 and it plays, and it's just fucking awful, and I cried.
00:49:03 Oh, that's a sad story.
00:49:05 But yeah, aside from that, you should buy a PS4 for Dark Cloud.
00:49:10 I haven't on my PS4.
00:49:12 I have not played more than 45 minutes for that one Let's Play when I was sick.
00:49:17 That's it.
00:49:19 Oh, yeah.
00:49:20 And I'm determined to beat it before I buy Dark Cloud 2, because it's also on there.
00:49:25 Yeah, I don't know whether you should play the whole of Dark Cloud before Dark Cloud 2.
00:49:30 I mean, I love it, but I know that the sequel is more streamlined and a better game in general,
00:49:36 and it has very little, if anything, to do with the first in terms of story.
00:49:41 And a lot of people played the sequel first.
00:49:45 So, you know, I don't blame people for liking that one over the original,
00:49:48 but I still like the original a lot.
00:49:50 Well, I want to play the original anyways, just because it's a classic action RPG,
00:49:54 and that's kind of my thing, is that whole genre.
00:49:59 And it's interesting, if nothing else.
00:50:02 I didn't even, like, I mean, I'd played it as a kid, but never gotten very far in it,
00:50:06 and then, like, your video, when you're like,
00:50:08 oh, there's like five different characters you get to play as.
00:50:11 I'm like, what the fuck?
00:50:12 I didn't even know there were other characters you got at all.
00:50:16 That was a great video, incidentally.
00:50:19 I've said this before, I said this before to you,
00:50:22 but your videos have the highest rate of making me want to play the games immediately.
00:50:28 Like, I actually went out, like, I spent a while trying to track down Dark Cloud for the PS2,
00:50:34 like, because I had seen it one time at a local game store,
00:50:39 and then, like, as soon as your video came out, I went back and tried to find it,
00:50:43 and they didn't have it, and then I would just, like, hunt for it at game stores,
00:50:46 because I didn't want to buy it online, because, ugh.
00:50:49 And then, once it hit the PS4, I was like, oh, yeah, immediately buy that.
00:50:56 And I also bought Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright because of your video, like, immediately,
00:51:02 and then never played it for more than 30 minutes.
00:51:07 I'm good at making people spend their money, but not by having fun.
00:51:11 I mean, and I also really wanted to play Jak and Daxter after your video,
00:51:14 but I remember that the exact reason I didn't, and this is probably true of all of them,
00:51:19 but it was because it's always been hard for me to justify playing a game
00:51:23 if I'm not going to make a video about it, and you had already just made a video about it.
00:51:28 So, like, that's always the catch-22 with video game videos,
00:51:32 is it's like, oh, cool, that analysis really made me want to play that game,
00:51:35 but now I can't make an analysis of the game because it already exists,
00:51:39 so I can't play the game.
00:51:42 I totally know how you feel about not feeling right playing a game
00:51:47 when I'm not going to make a video about it,
00:51:49 because that's the whole reason I started the Let's Plays,
00:51:52 aside from the fact that I thought Let's Plays might be fun
00:51:55 and I could maybe get better at talking through them.
00:51:58 I just wanted to play these old games, like I played Rayman 2, which was great,
00:52:03 and I actually beat it for the first time in the Let's Play,
00:52:06 but I would have never played it again,
00:52:09 even though I owned it through digital download or whatever.
00:52:14 I would have never played it if I didn't have a video planned for it,
00:52:18 so that was why I did all those Let's Plays, and then I got bored.
00:52:22 And now I'm doing, like, GRPJ, which is my excuse to play games,
00:52:27 really long games, and not have to record any of the things in them,
00:52:31 so it's more fun.
00:52:32 Good reason to play GRPJ.
00:52:35 It is a very good reason to play GRPJ.
00:52:38 That's, like, for me, when me and Victor started Digi Bros.
00:52:44 The biggest problem I've had with it the whole time
00:52:48 is that Victor will only do it if he gets to play the games,
00:52:51 so I would love to be able to finally play all these video games
00:52:56 and make Let's Plays out of them and make that my excuse,
00:52:59 but I can't do it because Victor won't watch me play video games.
00:53:03 So it never happens.
00:53:06 But I have tried to do that myself.
00:53:09 Like, I really wanted to just play a game,
00:53:11 and I'm like, okay, we're just going to turn on a recording.
00:53:13 And, like, Dark Souls 3, I was convinced I would write something about it,
00:53:17 and I never did.
00:53:19 But I'm finally getting over it, and maybe you can too.
00:53:22 Like, with Doom, that was the moment.
00:53:24 I finally just played a game because I liked it,
00:53:26 with no intentions of writing about it,
00:53:28 and it was a really good time.
00:53:31 Yeah, I mean, I've been playing Twilight Princess today
00:53:35 because I got a TV, and that's cool.
00:53:38 And I have no intention of ever making a video about that
00:53:41 unless, you know, I really feel like it.
00:53:44 But, you know, Zelda games are so well documented,
00:53:47 it's kind of pointless.
00:53:49 What console are you playing it on?
00:53:51 On the Wii.
00:53:53 I got the games.
00:53:55 Wii RectaPray!
00:53:57 Yeah, I would, thank you.
00:54:01 I would let you into my house.
00:54:04 I, uh...
00:54:07 I hate the Wii.
00:54:10 You hate it?
00:54:12 How do you feel about the Wii?
00:54:15 I actually...
00:54:18 I mean, because the PlayStation 3 annoyed me,
00:54:20 and I never cared for the Xbox,
00:54:22 the Wii was my favorite of that generation,
00:54:25 purely by, you know, being the other one.
00:54:28 And I did kind of like Wii Fit,
00:54:31 because it actually made me a jog on the spot,
00:54:34 which I never did, and I have never done since,
00:54:37 because I stopped playing that game.
00:54:40 Not that you need to lose weight or anything,
00:54:43 since you're like 90 pounds.
00:54:45 No, but I don't exercise at all.
00:54:47 Yeah, I'm very small.
00:54:49 I don't eat food.
00:54:51 But I don't go out of my way to go get something.
00:54:55 I just eat what's put in front of my plate.
00:54:58 Or on my plate, rather.
00:55:01 So, uh...
00:55:03 You've covered mostly on your channel
00:55:06 like your favorite games, right?
00:55:09 Yeah.
00:55:11 You sort of make a point to like highlight games
00:55:13 that you really loved from your childhood,
00:55:16 or that still hold up today.
00:55:19 Yeah, it's...
00:55:21 I kind of don't like the whole,
00:55:23 oh, fuck all these shitty games, am I right?
00:55:27 Because, I mean, it's funny to be mad at something,
00:55:30 but it's more interesting when you're mad
00:55:33 at something that fucking tore your soul apart.
00:55:36 Like the Banjo-Kazooie nuts and bolts video.
00:55:39 Like, I don't have something of that equivalent.
00:55:42 Or maybe I do. I don't know.
00:55:44 I'll figure it out if I do.
00:55:46 I mean, if Dark Souls 2 wasn't so well covered,
00:55:48 I'd probably be a good candidate.
00:55:50 Yeah, I would.
00:55:52 But I like just making videos about stuff
00:55:55 that I like with the intent
00:55:58 that I can tell people about it.
00:56:00 Because with all those other sort of games
00:56:02 that people talk about, like Zelda,
00:56:04 I know that those are massively popular
00:56:06 and everybody, oh, is it not recording?
00:56:09 Am I not recording? What's going on?
00:56:11 I had to kick Nate out,
00:56:13 because he made your internet so bad
00:56:15 that I couldn't hear you anymore.
00:56:17 Okay, what was I saying?
00:56:19 Oh yeah, I wanted to make videos about good games,
00:56:21 because other games like Zelda,
00:56:24 they get massive coverage,
00:56:26 and I know loads of people love them.
00:56:28 I don't need to make a video about why Zelda is good.
00:56:31 But I do feel like I need to make a video about
00:56:34 why Wretched and Clank is good,
00:56:36 because I don't hear as many people talk about Wretched and Clank,
00:56:38 or, you know, some more obscure games
00:56:40 like the Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright,
00:56:42 which I heard nobody talk about ever.
00:56:44 And it's fucking brilliant.
00:56:46 I saw all these cool things I want to talk about Okami.
00:56:49 People haven't made a really good Okami video.
00:56:51 I'm sure there is one or two.
00:56:53 Well, you know, I've always thought that was fucking weird,
00:56:56 because I loved Wretched and Clank back in the day,
00:56:59 and even back then, I knew,
00:57:01 I've always known that the games sell really well.
00:57:04 Obviously, they keep making more of them.
00:57:06 They've always been considered like a mascot for Sony.
00:57:09 And they get really well critically reviewed.
00:57:12 The three were both like, especially three,
00:57:14 was like hugely well reviewed.
00:57:16 I would see them on...
00:57:17 Yeah, three is great.
00:57:18 I'd see them on TV.
00:57:19 You know, they had like mainstream advertising.
00:57:21 And like, if you go into like a character poll
00:57:23 or a best game ever poll,
00:57:25 then like, they usually do okay.
00:57:27 But yet, no one talks about them.
00:57:30 And I've never understood it.
00:57:32 Like, I've never known anybody in person
00:57:34 who knew Wretched and Clank
00:57:36 until like, you know, some of my friends that I met,
00:57:38 like, later on.
00:57:40 And like, they get no critical analysis.
00:57:43 Nobody ever talks about them
00:57:44 when they're talking about their favorite games.
00:57:46 I'm like, what the fuck?
00:57:47 Like, why does no one talk about these games that are great?
00:57:50 And then you finally came along.
00:57:52 I think, it just feels like
00:57:54 the market of video game reviews
00:57:56 is dominated by early Nintendo fags.
00:57:59 They just like all those early games.
00:58:01 They were there before,
00:58:03 and they were big and good and stuff.
00:58:05 It's like, everything is either...
00:58:06 No one cares about the new stuff.
00:58:07 I think the reason that that era gets glossed over
00:58:09 is that like, everyone wants to talk about new stuff
00:58:12 because it's relevant to everybody.
00:58:14 And then people like to talk about the first classics
00:58:18 because they said a lot of the rules of what stuff came after.
00:58:22 And also, I think they're just easier to talk about.
00:58:24 Like, it's pretty simple to blast through a 30-minute NES game
00:58:28 and deconstruct what makes it great.
00:58:30 Whereas like, I think the PS2 is right in that era
00:58:33 where it wasn't like new ideas.
00:58:35 It was just perfecting ideas, you know?
00:58:38 But I mean, I guess we have like Devil May Cry games
00:58:41 for some reason get like, really well covered by everybody.
00:58:45 So it's not like all PS2 games go by the wayside that way.
00:58:49 Yeah, I think it's mostly the goofy platform of things
00:58:52 because I feel like a lot of people
00:58:54 see Ratchet and Clank and Jack and Dax or anything.
00:58:56 Banjo-Kazoo is better, you know?
00:58:58 They did the mascot animal thing first.
00:59:01 Not at all true.
00:59:02 Not at all.
00:59:03 I mean, I haven't played all of Banjo-Kazoo.
00:59:05 Banjo-Kazoo has the clunkiest fucking controls
00:59:08 and the worst live system ever.
00:59:11 I don't think it's a bad game,
00:59:13 but that game does not hold up with the ease
00:59:17 that like Ratchet and Clank 2 holds up.
00:59:19 Like, you could still play Ratchet and Clank 2 or 3 today
00:59:22 and you'd still have a good time.
00:59:24 Banjo-Kazoo has a lot of antiquated things that like...
00:59:27 I can't help it, I'm sorry.
00:59:29 It's a nightmare.
00:59:31 Hmm?
00:59:34 It...
00:59:35 What? Hippo?
00:59:36 Don't mean to make you cry.
00:59:38 You're popping in and out, fading.
00:59:40 And you sound like a ghost on the shelf.
00:59:42 Carry on, carry on.
00:59:44 I just hear every...
00:59:46 every so many seconds I hear...
00:59:50 I forgot the next lyric.
00:59:52 Am I a scrub or what?
00:59:55 Hey everyone, welcome to the...
00:59:57 Hippo, come back!
00:59:59 ...podcast, podcast with me.
01:00:02 What?
01:00:04 Oh, you came back.
01:00:05 Oh, you're there.
01:00:06 That whole last minute or so you've been cut out
01:00:09 and I've been singing.
01:00:10 Yeah, all I heard was just you going like...
01:00:16 Every once in a while I was like,
01:00:18 oh god, he's a ghost.
01:00:24 Yeah, what were you saying?
01:00:25 I don't even know.
01:00:28 Well, I'll just let that be a clusterfuck
01:00:30 for the people to listen to.
01:00:31 Yeah, I'll probably edit some of that out.
01:00:35 I know you won't because it's like an hour in
01:00:37 and you won't find it.
01:00:38 I edited the one I did with Jesse
01:00:40 to remove a bunch of fuckups like that, so...
01:00:48 So, are there any games that you definitely want to cover
01:00:51 on your show that you haven't yet?
01:00:54 I have a list.
01:00:56 I can't find it at the moment,
01:00:58 but I know I want to do Okami.
01:01:00 I want to do the other Wretched and Clank games.
01:01:02 I want to do the other Jack and Dexter games.
01:01:04 I want to do...
01:01:06 What else do I want to do?
01:01:07 There's lots.
01:01:09 Wait, I can look at my...
01:01:11 I can't look at my thing.
01:01:13 My shelf.
01:01:14 My shelf is blocked by a cupboard
01:01:16 and if I move it, it'll be loud.
01:01:18 Here we go, though.
01:01:19 I'm just going to move my cupboard.
01:01:20 Here we go.
01:01:24 It wasn't that loud.
01:01:26 It wasn't that loud.
01:01:30 You know what?
01:01:31 I can't see them because they're behind other games,
01:01:33 but forget it.
01:01:35 I have a lot of...
01:01:36 I have a list.
01:01:37 I have a list of cool games to talk about.
01:01:39 It's not just the action platform of mascot things.
01:01:43 It's cool games from the PS2 era.
01:01:46 All the RPGs.
01:01:49 All of them.
01:01:50 Every single one.
01:01:51 I'm going to do all the GRPGs.
01:01:53 I'm going to play all the cool games.
01:01:56 So...
01:01:57 Oh, Ape Escape.
01:01:58 That was a one.
01:01:59 Ape Escape 2.
01:02:01 We were going to do a thing with Jesse, weren't we?
01:02:03 Oh, yeah.
01:02:04 Because Jesse loves Ape Escape
01:02:06 and you love Ape Escape 2.
01:02:08 And then you found out...
01:02:09 Well, I love all the Ape Escapes.
01:02:11 But one of the Ape Escapes had a girl protagonist
01:02:14 and you were like,
01:02:15 Digi, you can do that one
01:02:16 and we can all cover Ape Escape.
01:02:19 That is a great idea.
01:02:20 I totally forgot about that.
01:02:26 I got it out, sir.
01:02:27 But yeah, are you still there?
01:02:28 I'm going to have to pull a plug.
01:02:29 He's a goner.
01:02:31 And I'm the guy with the plug.
01:02:33 See, this is the thing.
01:02:34 My internet's terrible.
01:02:35 Okay, don't worry about it.
01:02:36 It's just terrible
01:02:37 and I can't speak and I can't talk
01:02:38 and he can't hear him.
01:02:39 And I'm sorry.
01:02:41 I didn't mean for this to happen.
01:02:45 Technical difficulties.
01:02:47 Hello?
01:02:48 Hello?
01:02:49 Is there anybody in there?
01:02:52 Just nod if you can hear me.
01:02:54 Well, if you nod,
01:02:55 I can't see anything really.
01:02:57 So don't nod.
01:02:58 Make a sound if you can hear me.
01:03:02 Hello?
01:03:03 Oh, I was back for a second.
01:03:04 Hey!
01:03:05 Hey!
01:03:06 Hello?
01:03:07 All I've been hearing is...
01:03:08 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
01:03:10 Every couple of minutes.
01:03:12 Oh, this is a train.
01:03:15 But it's not wrecked yet.
01:03:17 We've got it still on the rails.
01:03:18 It's a crazy train.
01:03:19 It's going off the rails.
01:03:24 How much of what I was saying...
01:03:25 It's just gone again.
01:03:26 It's just...
01:03:27 Immediately it's gone.
01:03:28 See, this is what I have to deal with
01:03:29 the latest engines.
01:03:31 I just...
01:03:34 You're looking at me
01:03:35 for internet advice.
01:03:36 Don't.
01:03:37 It's bad.
01:03:38 I don't know how to fix it.
01:03:39 I don't know what I'm doing.
01:03:42 Goodness gracious.
01:03:43 Are you back?
01:03:45 I'm back.
01:03:47 Is someone doing something on your computer right now?
01:03:51 On one of them or something?
01:03:53 Making it worse?
01:03:54 No, I just have terrible internet.
01:03:56 I could ask my brothers to turn their computers off.
01:03:59 I don't know if it'll help.
01:04:02 If they're not actually doing anything on them.
01:04:05 They might be.
01:04:06 I was describing the apescape thing
01:04:09 when you cut out...
01:04:11 And I think it's a good idea
01:04:13 that we should still do at some point.
01:04:16 Yes.
01:04:18 Oh god, I don't remember my follow-up question.
01:04:23 Oh.
01:04:24 Oh.
01:04:25 G-RPG.
01:04:27 How'd it happen?
01:04:29 Yeah.
01:04:32 Well, I like RPGs.
01:04:35 And there are tons of RPGs I haven't played.
01:04:37 And I wanted to...
01:04:39 You know, it's like before with the Let's Plays.
01:04:42 It's an excuse to play a whole one of them
01:04:45 and make a video about it.
01:04:47 But I didn't want to record the whole RPG
01:04:50 because I know from Spoonie's videos
01:04:53 he's made reviews of Final Fantasy VII and stuff
01:04:57 and Final Fantasy VIII, I mean.
01:04:59 And they take up huge amounts of hard drive space recording
01:05:02 and then you have to look through it
01:05:04 and that idea is terrible.
01:05:06 I don't like that idea.
01:05:08 So I just thought I would steal footage from YouTube
01:05:11 and then talk about it on camera
01:05:14 in a sort of unscripted but kind of scripted way.
01:05:17 And that's why they exist.
01:05:19 Do they actually...
01:05:21 Do they actually take way less effort than a normal video?
01:05:24 Because they end up being long as fuck
01:05:26 and you usually do put in relevant footage.
01:05:29 So...
01:05:31 They're pretty intensive,
01:05:34 but compared to making a full review of an entire RPG
01:05:38 there's not even close to the amount of effort I would have had to put in.
01:05:42 So it's preferable, definitely.
01:05:45 I like putting in relevant footage
01:05:47 just so people get a...
01:05:50 If there's like a cutscene I'm talking about
01:05:52 you can see it.
01:05:53 Because one thing I hate is when...
01:05:56 It's when somebody's talking about something
01:05:59 and the thing that's on screen is just the clip
01:06:02 that's been playing for the last five minutes
01:06:04 and it's actually got nothing to do with what they're saying
01:06:06 and I can't visualize what they're talking about
01:06:08 because they're not showing it.
01:06:10 10 minutes ago and I'm like...
01:06:12 Well, I can't go back.
01:06:13 Can you just show it now?
01:06:15 I just hate that sort of stuff.
01:06:21 With your last GRPJ
01:06:23 Victor was watching it and he was complaining
01:06:26 because you had the laptop right in the middle of the screen
01:06:29 and he was like,
01:06:30 I can't ever tell what the fuck's happening in the cutscenes
01:06:33 because giving slaps tops are the way it.
01:06:35 I was like, well, I don't know if you're really supposed to pay attention to what's on screen.
01:06:39 Why did he edit it to be all relevant footage?
01:06:43 That is the one thing that I'm stupid about.
01:06:47 I don't know, man.
01:06:49 I thought of doing a weird green screen thing as the first thing
01:06:52 and now that's going to be the thing.
01:06:54 I'm going to have a weird green screen.
01:06:57 Partially because I don't want to get copyrighted in just in case
01:07:01 and also because it's hilarious.
01:07:03 But I guess I could just let things...
01:07:06 I can't help it though.
01:07:07 I see the editing thing and I'm like,
01:07:09 well, now I'm going to talk... I'm talking about this.
01:07:11 I'll just show some footage of whatever.
01:07:13 And now I'm talking about a specific thing.
01:07:15 Oh, I got to get that scene.
01:07:16 I mean, I got to get it.
01:07:17 I don't think it would be a problem if not for the giant laptop sitting in front of the screen.
01:07:24 I'll try and figure out a way to make it better for the next one, I guess.
01:07:28 Yeah.
01:07:29 I enjoyed those though.
01:07:30 I hadn't actually watched the Final Fantasy 7 one when it came out
01:07:33 and then after the Kingdom Hearts one I went back and watched the Final Fantasy 7 one
01:07:37 because the FF7 one came out at a time before I just watched every random long ass video.
01:07:43 And I was like, well, I haven't played Final Fantasy 7
01:07:47 so I'm not going to understand or care about any of this.
01:07:50 And then I went back and I was like, oh, this is actually good.
01:07:52 You actually edited this video.
01:07:56 Yeah.
01:07:57 But I definitely want to...
01:07:58 It's disguised as a ramble but it isn't really.
01:08:01 I want to copy the format myself.
01:08:05 Actually, really, that might have been the direct inspiration for the laying around videos that I've been doing this month
01:08:13 where it's like laying around watching Non-Nun Biori until I like it
01:08:17 where I'll watch an episode of the show and then just turn on the camera and ramble at it
01:08:22 because I like this idea of covering the entire thing
01:08:28 just every random thought you had about it through playing
01:08:31 and then just throwing that all out there.
01:08:33 And it's not something that's super reshareable and revisitable the way that a main video is
01:08:41 but if people just want to hear someone talk about Kingdom Hearts, then that could be interesting
01:08:46 which I thought it was interesting and I haven't played that game in fucking 11 years.
01:08:52 Yeah.
01:08:53 A lot of people found it interesting.
01:08:55 I've been getting like a lot of comments from people who are clearly not subscribed.
01:08:59 They just found it.
01:09:00 I guess it's been shared among Kingdom Hearts fans
01:09:03 and people are agreeing with my points even though they still think it's a good game
01:09:08 despite its flaws and I don't know, it's nice.
01:09:11 It's nice that something like this conversational sort of like just talking about a thing
01:09:18 not really with a big point can still get across to a lot of people and they can enjoy it.
01:09:23 I mean what I came to realize over time is that like the amount of effort you put into your video
01:09:29 has nothing to do with how many people will watch it or how much they'll care about it.
01:09:34 It's what the subject matter is.
01:09:36 Like I'm sure that the Kingdom Hearts video probably has as many views as most of the other videos on your channel, right?
01:09:44 Yeah.
01:09:45 So it's like even though it's a lower effort in terms of like being a big cool comedy thing,
01:09:52 I don't imagine people would like patron you as much for those kind of videos,
01:09:56 but people will still watch it and enjoy it and get something out of it
01:10:01 and that's why I've sort of turned to doing like a lot of these 45 minute long vlogs about anime
01:10:06 where it's like people just want to hear me talk about anime.
01:10:09 It doesn't really matter if I have something interesting like or like profound to say.
01:10:13 It's just, hey, what did you think of that show?
01:10:16 Well, let me tell you everything I thought of that show.
01:10:20 So yeah, GRPJ is pretty cool.
01:10:23 I'm copying it wholesale for myself and I'd love it as a GRPJ for myself
01:10:30 because I need a good reason to play these fucking JRPGs.
01:10:36 You could steal the formula if you credit me at the beginning of everything.
01:10:39 Oh, I certainly would.
01:10:41 I don't know if I'd steal your categories or anything.
01:10:43 I would probably just fucking unscripted rant about them or something,
01:10:47 but I would love a GRPJ.
01:10:51 I'm jealous of the fact that you found a GRPJ
01:10:57 because like in the mid-2000s, I was obsessed with JRPGs.
01:11:00 I never beat any of them.
01:11:07 Actually, I think I made a pact with myself that I would finish Persona 3 before the year was over.
01:11:14 Which year?
01:11:15 This year.
01:11:18 Like, I've been putting it off for 10 years and I think I said,
01:11:21 oh, you know what it was?
01:11:22 It was that I have to try to beat Persona 3 and 4 before Persona 5 comes out, I think, was my deal,
01:11:27 which is like this October, probably.
01:11:31 Good luck.
01:11:34 All right, Hippo.
01:11:38 Do you have anything to say about video games other than what I've been asking you
01:11:43 for this interview?
01:11:48 I like shitty graphics.
01:11:51 I like low-resolution things.
01:11:55 Really big pixelated textures like PS1 sort of stuff.
01:11:59 It's really, really cool.
01:12:01 I like the aesthetic more than I like actually good-looking, realistic stuff.
01:12:05 You know, those PS1 games, what bothers me the most is the wobbly thing.
01:12:11 I love the wobbly thing.
01:12:13 It makes me feel dizzy and sick.
01:12:17 I tried to play a vagrant story.
01:12:21 You should put that on your GRPJ list because that's a great JRPG.
01:12:27 It's supposed to have one of the deepest stories in an RPG,
01:12:31 but it's got that wobbly effect to such an extreme that it really makes me want to die.
01:12:38 Even though the aesthetic of the game is great other than that.
01:12:44 I don't know.
01:12:45 I think that I just love, I don't know what it is about the wobbly thing.
01:12:49 It's just like you turn the camera and it moves a little and you like you can see
01:12:53 like things popping in and out of being like correct and wrong.
01:12:58 I don't know.
01:12:59 Something about this just really...
01:13:01 It's like a glitch in the Matrix.
01:13:03 Yeah, I don't know what it is.
01:13:05 I can't explain it.
01:13:06 It's just cool.
01:13:07 Well, I guess for me it's weird because I didn't grow up with it
01:13:09 because I had an N64 which did not have that same thing.
01:13:12 Yes, it's weird.
01:13:13 I guess it's the same generation, so it's not really an upgrade,
01:13:16 but N64 looks much better in general.
01:13:20 Yeah, well it had...
01:13:22 It was the problem with the N64 was that it had better graphical power,
01:13:27 but it had less space because they kept cartridges
01:13:31 and discs could hold more and you could have more of them.
01:13:35 So Final Fantasy VII would never have fit onto an N64 cartridge
01:13:39 because it was four fucking discs or three fucking discs.
01:13:44 So that's why there were no RPGs on the N64 except for Quest 64
01:13:49 which everyone thinks is fucking garbage,
01:13:51 but otherwise it was not a single RPG because they were too fucking big.
01:13:56 Nintendo and their fucking weird decisions.
01:14:00 They never seemed to...
01:14:03 Ever since the N64, I feel like they never have the developer's best interest in mind
01:14:09 when they make their systems.
01:14:11 I don't know.
01:14:12 I think the Wii U is pretty good,
01:14:14 but I don't think people were on board for developing for it because of the Wii.
01:14:19 They thought it was just another gimmick thing.
01:14:21 Well, the Wii U obviously has much higher graphical capabilities and stuff,
01:14:27 but you still can't do...
01:14:29 You couldn't run uncharted on there or something, you know?
01:14:33 I mean, I'm sure that there's a lot of games that would have been cross-platform to the Wii U,
01:14:40 but can't be.
01:14:42 But I don't know.
01:14:43 I don't know to what extent that goes.
01:14:48 Hippo, how about you tell me some stuff about your life?
01:14:54 My history.
01:14:55 Your backstory.
01:14:57 Where does Hippo come from?
01:14:58 You live in London.
01:15:00 You're not even in the United States.
01:15:02 That's true.
01:15:03 I mean, I don't know whether people could tell that I'm English from my accent,
01:15:08 but I am.
01:15:09 I would hope so.
01:15:11 I've had a lot of people over the years, I guess it is now, years,
01:15:16 be surprised when they learn that I'm English instead of like a weird Australian something or other.
01:15:23 That's because most people hear Australians and think they're fucking British.
01:15:27 That is true also.
01:15:28 No one can apparently tell the difference.
01:15:30 But yeah.
01:15:31 And I think it's that a lot of people think Yatzee is Australian because he lives in Australia,
01:15:37 and so people get those accents confused.
01:15:40 And people think Anthony C is...
01:15:42 No, wait.
01:15:44 Anthony C is British, but he lives...
01:15:47 He's British Australian.
01:15:48 Yeah, that's the combo.
01:15:51 No, I live in England, London Place, and that's about that.
01:15:59 I don't know what to say about my backstory.
01:16:03 I went to school.
01:16:04 I didn't like it.
01:16:06 I wanted to be on the school podcast, but I think I was either asleep or the internet didn't work.
01:16:13 But there's school things.
01:16:15 I went and did a lot of art.
01:16:17 I liked art until they kicked me out for drawing.
01:16:20 Not drawing, but like writing.
01:16:22 I want to kill everybody in my art book.
01:16:25 That was the story I wanted to bring onto the school podcast.
01:16:29 Is that I got kicked out of school.
01:16:31 I'd go ahead and tell it here.
01:16:32 Okay.
01:16:33 Well, one day, I was an angry depressed teenager boy, and I wrote my art book.
01:16:39 Fucking, I hate everybody.
01:16:41 Kill, die, murder, or whatever.
01:16:43 Exactly what I said, and I was feeling a bit nervous about it because I knew they would see it,
01:16:48 but I kind of wanted them to see it and read it and be like, oh my goodness.
01:16:53 And they did, but they did more than I thought they would, and they banned me from school.
01:16:57 They said, you can't come in.
01:16:58 And the reason which was hilarious to me and my parents was that I'm a danger to myself and fellow classmates
01:17:05 because they thought I was either suicidal or homicidal from those few words I wrote in my art book.
01:17:11 So I just came into the school the next day.
01:17:14 They didn't even phone me or anything.
01:17:16 They just said, excuse me, you're not allowed in.
01:17:18 You have to go home.
01:17:19 I said, well, I can't.
01:17:21 My mom dropped me off.
01:17:22 I was like, oh, we'll call your mom.
01:17:24 So I just had to sit there being like, what the fuck?
01:17:29 And then they sent me away from home and they said they needed a written doctor's note saying that I was sane or whatever.
01:17:39 Jesus fucking Christ.
01:17:40 It's it was the most overreaction thing that I've ever experienced at school.
01:17:45 And I just fucking, it made me angry.
01:17:49 It made me more angry and more, you know, liable to actually attack people.
01:17:53 And if they had just, you know, given me detention or something, because it was so presumptive.
01:18:01 I don't know.
01:18:02 That's my school story.
01:18:04 It doesn't work.
01:18:07 Although I did have, I did have a lot of fun at doing art in school.
01:18:11 I made a lot of, I did fine art in GCSE, which is good.
01:18:19 I made a lot of sculptures and paintings and I made a man out of tape and he lived in a giant tube out of tape, like black gaffer tape.
01:18:29 And it was all shiny and black and he was shiny and black.
01:18:32 And I made, no, the man was made out of a suit of tape that I made that I could wear and I can still wear because I'm really small.
01:18:41 And it's really weird.
01:18:43 But yeah, art's cool.
01:18:45 And then I went on to college to do a foundation degree because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.
01:18:50 I was kind of feeling interested in animation, but I didn't feel ready for it.
01:18:55 So I did a foundation year in college and that was fun.
01:19:00 I met a few friends that I now don't talk to, but whatever.
01:19:04 And then I went to, oh, are you going to say someone?
01:19:08 No, you can continue.
01:19:10 And then I went to uni and I did my three year animation degree and I met friends that are really cool.
01:19:16 And I'm keeping in touch with them, which is cool.
01:19:19 We played D&D on, well, we played one session of D&D and I got an animation degree and that's my school career, I guess.
01:19:29 My school journey.
01:19:31 Yeah.
01:19:33 You kind of left unresolved.
01:19:35 After you got expelled from that school, did you get back in or what?
01:19:39 Oh, yeah.
01:19:40 Well, it was just like, I was out for a couple of weeks or maybe a month or something.
01:19:45 And we asked the doctor and they said, we need a fucking note to say that I'm sane.
01:19:51 And they're like, what?
01:19:52 The doctor was like, the fuck?
01:19:54 So she just wrote a note and she said, just let him in.
01:19:58 Like he's fucking, he wrote a little thing in his art book, who cares?
01:20:02 And then the school was like, okay.
01:20:04 And I felt like the reason, no, it was the reason, the reason they sent me home was not so much because they were afraid of me attacking students.
01:20:12 But they didn't want to be responsible for me attacking anybody.
01:20:16 So like if I attacked somebody at school, they didn't want to be seen as the reason.
01:20:20 So like if I was going to a kill myself, they wanted it to be at home.
01:20:25 So that they didn't get in trouble, which was fucking really, I hate them.
01:20:30 I hate them all.
01:20:31 School sucks.
01:20:32 I gotta say, that's the first time I've ever felt lucky about my story that it didn't get to that point.
01:20:41 You heard mine right in the school podcast.
01:20:44 I haven't listened to it yet, but I might have heard it before, but I'll listen to it.
01:20:50 So how did that month treat you?
01:20:55 I mean, it sounds like it was awesome.
01:20:57 You got to not go to school for like a month.
01:20:59 It was kind of awesome.
01:21:01 But at the same time, I think it wasn't GCSE.
01:21:04 I think it was in A level.
01:21:05 So in A level, you choose three subjects and I would chose art, art and photography, I think, and physics.
01:21:13 But I dropped physics.
01:21:14 So it was basically fun times all the times because I liked art and I liked the art department
01:21:19 and I liked sitting in the art department doing whatever I was doing and not going and talking to anyone.
01:21:24 So staying at home was not actually that fun because the only things I could do was play games
01:21:32 and the only game I had at the time that I was trying to be good at playing was Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
01:21:39 because all the people at school were playing it.
01:21:41 And I felt like I needed to be into a game that everybody was into in order to be popular,
01:21:46 which was what I was trying to do, but I was playing that so much and I got so angry at it that I nearly broke it.
01:21:53 I nearly broke my controller and everything.
01:21:55 So I hate Call of Duty.
01:21:57 Jesus.
01:21:58 It wasn't a good time.
01:22:00 I felt really sad.
01:22:03 So what does the future hold for the hippo man if everything goes according to plan?
01:22:12 The future.
01:22:14 Well, I want to make a bunch of videos by the end of the year and then after that,
01:22:20 well, I'm going to Radcon, your house, the Radconference.
01:22:24 Yes.
01:22:25 And that is somewhat of a test out, a try out for potentially me living either with you or near you
01:22:37 in the future to be able to do more collaborative things with the rest of the PC, the TCP, TPCPC members.
01:22:46 Yeah, that's essentially the purpose of Radcon is.
01:22:49 Yeah.
01:22:50 So let's do things together and see what we can do together and see if like logistically how we could possibly all live together in the future.
01:23:01 Yeah.
01:23:02 So after that, you're the hardest one to move in though because you're in another country and currently no income.
01:23:12 Yeah, not really.
01:23:14 I mean, a Patreon is tiny.
01:23:16 It's like $50, $60 a month, which is not good enough, guys.
01:23:23 Come on, give me some more.
01:23:28 That's my Patreon plug.
01:23:30 There it is.
01:23:31 That's all I got to say about it.
01:23:34 But I want to be making videos so that after Radcon, if I've decided that I want to go to America and it's like seems like a good idea possible to do,
01:23:45 I will try to make as many videos that will get me Patreon money and AdSense money and get growing big channel, big, big money, big, get money, get big money and I want to get big money
01:23:55 so that I can move out safely.
01:23:57 I don't want to go to America and then die in the streets because that's probably what would happen if I went now.
01:24:05 Probably because of the plane ticket alone to get there and then, you know, buying a house, I mean, I don't know, renting an apartment.
01:24:15 It would feel weird and also I'd have to get like a visa or a change the nationality.
01:24:21 I don't know how any of that stuff works.
01:24:23 It's a scary idea to go and live in America forever.
01:24:27 So I want to make sure I'm getting a decent income because it doesn't matter where I do my YouTube videos.
01:24:32 It just matters that I do YouTube videos and I can make money.
01:24:35 Well, that's kind of where I live.
01:24:37 The whole basis of us all moving in together is like that it doesn't matter where you do YouTube from.
01:24:46 So like all of us, like the only people who who like absolutely we know can't just pick up and leave are you because you can't leave England that easily and you don't have any income.
01:24:59 And then Nate because he has a real job and for anyone else it's like the sky is the limit.
01:25:06 Like it doesn't matter where we are.
01:25:07 You can do YouTube from anywhere as long as you have a decent internet connection, which is why Davoo particularly wants to get out of where he is to get a better internet connection.
01:25:16 And Jesse where we don't know about because he takes care of his family and everything.
01:25:23 But yeah, that's pretty much the idea is hey, if we could do it from anywhere, why not do it from right next to each other where we could do way more shit.
01:25:32 It just seems like a good idea.
01:25:35 It'll be really cool, especially having Victor do all our skits.
01:25:40 Yeah, if he's still around, which who knows.
01:25:44 I mean, I haven't seen that motherfucker in like a month because he's been constantly working.
01:25:52 I actually saw him for a brief glimpse like two days ago.
01:25:56 He came in and he was all like, I'm going to Hope's house and then left.
01:26:01 That was it.
01:26:02 That was all I saw of him all week.
01:26:05 I'm not even joking.
01:26:07 That's exactly what he did.
01:26:11 Oh God, he's got a lot of hope in the future.
01:26:18 So you actually you're you're closer to Davoo on the scale of watching all the shit I make.
01:26:25 At least you watch all the Digi Bros.
01:26:27 Yeah.
01:26:28 Yeah, I watch all the Digi Bros.
01:26:30 I watch the Digi Bro.
01:26:31 I watch as much as I can.
01:26:33 I haven't been watching your After Dark vlogs recently because my internet's been so poor.
01:26:38 I have to really pick and choose which videos I let buffer all day.
01:26:42 So I haven't been watching those.
01:26:45 What the fuck is the deal with your internet right now?
01:26:47 What is this nightmare that you've been living in?
01:26:49 All right, hopefully by the time this podcast comes up, it will be sorted.
01:26:53 Although I don't know how long you're going to take to make it to put it up.
01:26:57 Next Tuesday, so six days from now.
01:27:00 All right, probably won't be sorted by then.
01:27:02 But the idea is we had an internet service provider and they went bust.
01:27:08 And then we got shoved into this other one, which was like it consumed it.
01:27:13 I don't really know the specifics.
01:27:14 I just heard this from my parents that they had an internet service provider and it died.
01:27:19 And then we have been swept all the way into this other one, which is absolute garbage.
01:27:23 And it's very difficult to get out because of a weird thing with my dad's company who pays the phone bill.
01:27:32 And it's confusing and I don't get it.
01:27:34 And all it means is that the internet is absolutely abysmal.
01:27:38 So long as there are more than two people using a computer at once in the house.
01:27:43 And there usually is.
01:27:45 That all sounds like it should be illegal.
01:27:48 Yeah.
01:27:51 I don't like it.
01:27:53 I'm sad.
01:27:55 I made a single rage tweet on Twitter about it.
01:28:00 And a guy said, if your internet is so bad, how come you're on Twitter, you idiot?
01:28:05 Or whatever.
01:28:06 You use those arrows, the 4chan arrows.
01:28:09 Twitter is like the easiest fucking site to load in the universe.
01:28:14 It doesn't take a huge load on your internet.
01:28:16 Fuck that guy.
01:28:17 I did.
01:28:18 Fuck your listening. Fuck you, guy.
01:28:21 I mean, I don't really hate him.
01:28:23 It's just in the moment.
01:28:25 And after I responded to him, I said, fucking, I explained that I didn't say all of my internet.
01:28:31 I said, some of my internet, fuck you, guy.
01:28:34 And then he replied with salt.
01:28:37 And then I blocked him because fuck that guy.
01:28:40 That's a very good reaction.
01:28:42 Anyone who uses the word salt deserves to be blocked.
01:28:46 Salt and pepper.
01:28:48 Pepper's okay. Say pepper instead.
01:28:51 Say paprika, anything.
01:28:54 Let's go through some words I know you hate.
01:28:56 Salt, cringe, get good.
01:29:01 Well, you actually enjoy cringe, though.
01:29:03 I enjoy cringe.
01:29:04 It's fun.
01:29:05 It's hilarious.
01:29:06 I know you have a problem with people who try to be dismissive by acting cool.
01:29:12 Like, your opinion doesn't matter because I'm cooler.
01:29:16 You need to get good and stuff like that.
01:29:18 Oh, get good.
01:29:19 Yeah, well, that's the specific term get good is annoying because it exemplifies that.
01:29:24 I guess I just don't like people assuming much of me based on the small things that I say.
01:29:33 And when they look down on me, I'm like, who the hell are you, bitch?
01:29:37 Don't you get angry ever?
01:29:41 You were cut out through half of that sentence, but it's okay because you said the whole thing and it'll be on the recording.
01:29:49 Yep.
01:29:54 How do you spend your time on the internet?
01:29:58 How would you say it's divided between?
01:30:01 Well, a lot of it is YouTube.
01:30:05 A lot of the time, I'm just either watching a YouTube video.
01:30:09 Like, it's very rare that I have no YouTube videos ready to watch.
01:30:14 There's usually I watch Creparion, which is a Hearthstone YouTuber, and he makes two videos a day and they're always interesting to watch because Hearthstone is just fun to watch for me.
01:30:22 And then there's all the stuff the TPC members do.
01:30:26 And I've cut out all of my podcasts.
01:30:30 The only podcast I listen to is the procrastinators podcast if I wasn't on it.
01:30:35 And I think the sleepycast, yeah, those are the only two podcasts I listen to.
01:30:41 I used to listen to a bunch more.
01:30:43 I made a whole ramble about it on my Give and Take channel about how I need to cut out all this stuff because YouTube has taken up so much of my time in general.
01:30:50 I just needed to stop it.
01:30:54 Aside from YouTube, I usually check Twitter a lot and I check Tumblr somewhat, but not really that much anymore.
01:31:04 Because it's generally just kind of...
01:31:09 It's not really a thing you go back to check an update because none of the notifications I get or asks I get are interesting.
01:31:17 I actually don't get asks anymore.
01:31:20 So Twitter is my main sort of let's see what's happening thing and then other than that it's YouTube and I don't think anything else.
01:31:28 I don't do... I don't like streams at all.
01:31:34 Well, you were cut out for me for like the last two minutes and it sounds like you just kept talking.
01:31:41 So that's great.
01:31:45 Did I cut out again or did you cut out?
01:31:47 Jesus Christ.
01:31:49 Damn it.
01:31:50 Hey darkness, my old friend, come in, have a cup of tea.
01:31:56 You don't like tea? You like coffee? Black? Sure.
01:32:00 You are? Darkness? My old friend.
01:32:02 Hey, how's the thing? How's your wife? She's dead? Good. I don't care for her either.
01:32:09 We're halfway there.
01:32:13 Living on a prayer.
01:32:16 Take my hand and make it out there.
01:32:21 Living on a prayer.
01:32:24 Is it? No? No? You made a little noise. You made a little it and that's it. Also, I could hear.
01:32:30 Oh dear.
01:32:34 I can't wait to hear the entire secret other podcast you've been doing with yourself.
01:32:39 All these times that you've cut out.
01:32:41 It's gonna be interesting.
01:32:43 Are you actually here this time?
01:32:44 Yeah, oh.
01:32:45 Hippo.
01:32:47 Hippo.
01:32:48 As soon as you say something.
01:32:49 Hippo!
01:32:50 Fucking gun, you're dead. I'm dead, we're dead. This is the dead podcast.
01:32:55 Hey, you know what? I like murder.
01:32:58 I like murdering internet service providers.
01:33:01 That's fun. You go to their house, they say, excuse me, who are you?
01:33:05 And I just stab you in the brain.
01:33:08 Woo, in the brain. Right there.
01:33:11 I bypass the skin. I bypass the skull.
01:33:14 I stab you directly in the brain with my brain knife.
01:33:16 It cuts only your brain.
01:33:18 I made it especially for you. You sick fuck.
01:33:22 Why do you do this to me?
01:33:24 Why do you do this to this podcast?
01:33:26 I mean, it's probably interesting. Probably hilarious.
01:33:29 Seeing both of us flounder.
01:33:31 Okay, you're back.
01:33:33 Are you back, though?
01:33:35 Okay, you are back. You are actually back.
01:33:37 We are actually back.
01:33:38 For another all too brief period.
01:33:40 Let's see how long that lasts.
01:33:43 It's already over, isn't it?
01:33:44 Are you gone?
01:33:45 Oh.
01:33:46 It's already over.
01:33:47 It's already over.
01:33:48 It's already over! It's already over!
01:33:51 Hippo!
01:33:53 Hippo!
01:33:55 Hippo!
01:33:57 Come back to me.
01:34:02 Ladies and gentlemen,
01:34:06 do you understand the implications of this?
01:34:12 I forgot the rest of that.
01:34:14 Oh, Aaron Hansen.
01:34:19 You don't even try, dude.
01:34:21 Don't even try.
01:34:22 This is the two-way podcast.
01:34:24 Streams.
01:34:25 We're on two different universes now.
01:34:27 Both of us sailing along on the Milky Way.
01:34:33 Individual.
01:34:35 All individually.
01:34:36 And that's the way the cookie rumbles.
01:34:40 That's the way...
01:34:43 That's the way it's meant to be.
01:34:46 That's the way...
01:34:48 That's the way it ought to stay.
01:34:54 You know what?
01:34:55 Wait right there, everyone.
01:35:14 Here we go.
01:35:15 Let's start with a good old...
01:35:18 This...
01:35:23 Oh, fuck.
01:35:24 I did it wrong.
01:35:25 Let's do it again.
01:35:29 Blackbird singing in the dead of night.
01:35:33 Three deep broken wings and learned to climb.
01:35:38 All your life.
01:35:41 You were only waiting for this moment to arrive.
01:35:52 I hate it.
01:36:06 I hate it.
01:36:10 It sucks.
01:36:16 Internet.
01:36:20 Internet.
01:36:25 Here's a solo.
01:36:28 But I've been...
01:36:32 Are we here?
01:36:35 You spoke too soon, you fool.
01:36:38 Oh, you fool.
01:36:41 You spoke too soon.
01:36:59 Fuck this shit, I'm dead.
01:37:06 Very good at improved guitars.
01:37:08 But here's one from the ages.
01:37:25 Oh no, we're not here.
01:37:30 You're silly, Digi.
01:37:32 You think it's okay.
01:37:35 It's not.
01:37:37 You're gay.
01:37:39 We're in the thing.
01:37:46 The thing that which...
01:37:47 I can't think of the word.
01:37:48 You know what?
01:37:49 It's like the limbo?
01:37:52 That's a bad word.
01:37:53 Limbo.
01:37:54 You were in the limbo.
01:37:56 The limbo of the limbo.
01:37:59 On the window of the windowsill.
01:38:03 It's bad here.
01:38:04 I don't like it very much.
01:38:05 It's got graham on the side.
01:38:07 It's a bad game.
01:38:10 It's not a game.
01:38:11 I'm not talking about a game.
01:38:15 Here's another classic.
01:38:34 You know, I'm not actually very good at that.
01:38:47 Let's click the knuckles.
01:38:49 Alright.
01:38:50 I can't...
01:38:54 Alright, I can.
01:38:55 That's the way you look at the world.
01:38:57 I can.
01:39:00 That's out of tune.
01:39:01 That's why it sounds bad.
01:39:03 It's not me.
01:39:05 Let's do a whole fucking...
01:39:06 I'm tuning my fucking guitar while Digi is like...
01:39:09 Oh, I wish the podcast was working.
01:39:12 But you know what?
01:39:14 Maybe he'll cut his own bit out and this will just be me.
01:39:16 Me and you.
01:39:18 You like TPC?
01:39:19 I like it.
01:39:20 I don't listen to it.
01:39:21 Because I'm usually there.
01:39:23 But when I'm not there, I try to listen to it.
01:39:25 It's fun.
01:39:26 It's nice.
01:39:27 I like being these guys' friends.
01:39:28 They're all my best friends.
01:39:29 They're soul to best times.
01:39:31 I love you all.
01:39:33 I'm burping.
01:39:39 Alright.
01:39:40 You all know the words to this one.
01:39:42 I don't.
01:40:01 I don't.
01:40:31 I don't.
01:41:01 I don't.
01:41:28 I could finish the song, but I messed up.
01:41:30 I'm sorry.
01:41:34 Oh, you heard it.
01:41:36 Oh, he heard it.
01:41:37 He heard some of it.
01:41:38 He was trying to sing along.
01:41:42 I should finish it for him.
01:42:00 I skipped to the other bit.
01:42:30 I don't know what to do.
01:42:37 I don't know what to do.
01:42:42 I don't know what to do.
01:42:47 I don't know what to do.
01:42:52 I don't know what to do.
01:42:59 I don't know what to do.
01:43:05 I don't know what to do.
01:43:12 I don't know what to do.
01:43:17 So, Hippo, give me a state of the Hippo address.
01:43:21 How do you feel about how your life is going right now?
01:43:24 The address?
01:43:26 State?
01:43:28 I feel my life is okay.
01:43:30 I feel my life is actually pretty great.
01:43:35 I'm at home with my parents, but my parents are cool,
01:43:38 so that's not an issue.
01:43:40 They love me, and I love them.
01:43:42 I've got a room.
01:43:44 The construction at my house is finished.
01:43:46 They've got an extension.
01:43:48 So now the house is really cool and new,
01:43:50 and I have a new room, and I have a new TV,
01:43:52 because it's my birthday,
01:43:54 and everything's looking up, really.
01:43:57 All I've got now is to focus on my career,
01:44:01 my money making,
01:44:03 and really, that's going well as well.
01:44:05 Actually, I can't complain.
01:44:07 Aside from the internet,
01:44:09 that'll be fixed within a month, probably.
01:44:13 So, my life's great.
01:44:15 How was yours?
01:44:17 What kind of frequency can we expect
01:44:19 new Hippo Crit videos with?
01:44:22 I'm trying to get them out to a month,
01:44:27 like one every two weeks.
01:44:30 That would be beautiful.
01:44:32 That would be a reality I want to live in.
01:44:35 Yeah.
01:44:37 I've got a follow-up to the miniclip games video coming,
01:44:42 but I don't know whether I'm already too late for that
01:44:44 to become two weeks later.
01:44:47 I don't think so.
01:44:49 I think either it's this week or next week,
01:44:52 well, obviously, it's this week or next week,
01:44:54 but it might be next this week.
01:44:56 I mean, the upload time alone
01:44:58 might make it come out a week later.
01:45:01 That's true.
01:45:03 I actually don't think the upload is that bad.
01:45:05 It's just staying connected.
01:45:07 Like, the connection is just wobbly in it.
01:45:10 It's like, okay, and then it's suddenly gone completely,
01:45:13 and then it's okay, and then it's gone completely.
01:45:16 I guess you could just hear.
01:45:18 It was like that just then.
01:45:23 So, I don't know how much you can say about this,
01:45:27 but there's also some contract work you've been doing, yeah?
01:45:32 Yeah.
01:45:34 I don't think it's, like, it's secret,
01:45:38 but I've written a pilot for a...
01:45:42 not necessarily ever going to be made TV show for teenagers,
01:45:47 a cartoon, animation cartoon,
01:45:49 because a person came to me and said,
01:45:52 I think your animations are funny.
01:45:54 Would you like to help us write a comedy script?
01:45:57 And I did.
01:45:59 I went and talked to them.
01:46:01 I helped design the characters and the idea of the show,
01:46:04 and I helped write the pilot.
01:46:06 I did write the pilot the script, and I sent that in,
01:46:08 and now they're using that in their animation studio
01:46:11 to pitch to a bunch of different studios' channels,
01:46:15 that is, to get them green lit and stuff.
01:46:18 That's all that's going on with that.
01:46:21 So, I don't know whether that will become anything,
01:46:24 but I'm sure I'll work with them in the future.
01:46:26 So, that's cool.
01:46:28 I had been under the impression it was a children's show you guys were making.
01:46:31 It was like a pre-bubescent children's,
01:46:35 sort of like 13, 12, sort of,
01:46:38 because it's for kids, but it's kind of dark,
01:46:41 because it's about death.
01:46:43 It's a train of ghosts.
01:46:46 It wasn't really a train of ghosts.
01:46:48 It started off as a train of ghosts,
01:46:50 and it was going to be spirited away.
01:46:52 That's the idea that I had in my head of what it would look like.
01:46:55 But like a show set on a train,
01:46:57 filled with mythical beasts and creatures and witches
01:47:00 and cool things like that.
01:47:03 Creatures of Greek myths and stuff,
01:47:07 you know, death, the grim reaper himself would be a character,
01:47:11 and he would be cool.
01:47:13 He would be all reserved and read the newspaper and stuff.
01:47:18 Just, you know, sit in the corner and not talk to anybody.
01:47:22 Be really shy. That was the thing with death.
01:47:24 He's really shy.
01:47:25 He doesn't like talking to people,
01:47:27 because, you know, he kills them eventually.
01:47:30 So, it's just sort of like, oh, no, no, that's fine.
01:47:33 I'll just sit here.
01:47:35 But yeah, the point of the show is there's a little girl
01:47:40 and she's an orphan,
01:47:41 and the orphanage is horrible and evil and despicable,
01:47:45 and the person there is evil, and she runs away
01:47:48 and she finds a magic train, she jumps on,
01:47:50 and before she thinks about where the train would be going.
01:47:53 And it turns out it's a ghost train with ghosts,
01:47:56 and it's cool, and she has adventures on the train.
01:48:01 I think in the scripts that I wrote,
01:48:03 she meets the spider girl, which is basically Muffet,
01:48:06 but a little girl Muffet from Undertale,
01:48:09 which is adorable to me,
01:48:12 especially the character design they based off of that.
01:48:16 I don't know whether I can show anybody the character designs,
01:48:19 but I don't think there's much point to it,
01:48:21 seeing as the show may never be made,
01:48:23 but it's cool.
01:48:26 Specifically, the person who brought you on to do this
01:48:29 was Anna Esther Volos, right?
01:48:31 That's how you pronounce her name.
01:48:33 Yeah, I don't know either, but Anna Esther Volos,
01:48:36 she's great, she's cool, you're cool,
01:48:39 you might be listening to this.
01:48:41 The longest time and highest paying patron
01:48:45 of a lot of the PCP.
01:48:48 Yeah, it's kind of impressive.
01:48:51 She was my biggest patron for a very, very long time,
01:48:54 but she also has her own YouTube channel
01:48:57 called Anna Stays At Home,
01:48:59 where she did a couple of really short anime analysis,
01:49:03 one for Ava and one for Utana,
01:49:06 specifically the ending of Utana,
01:49:08 like the last episode,
01:49:10 and a part of End of Ava as well,
01:49:13 and then this long-ass Rambley vlog about Dragon Age.
01:49:17 Which one had the Madagascar comparison?
01:49:21 That's the Ava one.
01:49:24 I always think of that one as the Madagascar one.
01:49:28 It's such a cool comparison to make.
01:49:31 Yeah, I never would have imagined someone
01:49:36 using Madagascar to analyze Ava.
01:49:41 I feel like there's not a lot of crossover
01:49:43 in people who have even seen both of those.
01:49:45 I certainly haven't seen Madagascar.
01:49:47 That's a good show.
01:49:49 I think Nate, for some reason,
01:49:51 doesn't like the idea of Dreamworks at all,
01:49:53 so he hasn't watched any of those things.
01:49:55 Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar are a great series of trilogies.
01:49:58 You should watch them if you like kids films.
01:50:01 I just heard that Madagascar was shit,
01:50:03 so that's why I never watched it.
01:50:05 It's not the best thing ever,
01:50:07 but Kung Fu Panda is fucking amazing.
01:50:09 Kung Fu Panda is the new Shrek.
01:50:11 Shrek is good,
01:50:13 and then Kung Fu Panda is the next one up.
01:50:15 Madagascar is kind of worse than both of them,
01:50:17 but it's still alright.
01:50:19 I really want to watch Shrek,
01:50:21 because I've gotten the impression
01:50:24 people don't look back fondly on Shrek.
01:50:27 It's become like a meme,
01:50:29 and it seems like people really hate that movie,
01:50:31 and I remember loving it as a kid.
01:50:33 I watched it a lot of times.
01:50:35 What I think is people remember it as a kid,
01:50:38 and then they look back at it,
01:50:40 and they're like,
01:50:41 whoa, all this is weird,
01:50:42 and then they made a meme out of it because of that,
01:50:44 but then, you know, as memes stewed,
01:50:46 they just became...
01:50:48 I really hate Shrek.
01:50:50 Well, they're dumb.
01:50:52 It's got great comedy.
01:50:54 Some animation fans, you know?
01:50:56 Yeah, I mean, it was a fun movie.
01:50:59 I don't remember anything about it that I'd be like,
01:51:01 oh, fucking Shrek is garbage.
01:51:04 I remember being pretty okay.
01:51:06 Shrek is great. Shrek 1 is great.
01:51:08 Shrek 2 is brilliant,
01:51:10 and then Shrek 3 and 4 is just sort of like,
01:51:12 yeah, I guess.
01:51:14 That's how they went,
01:51:16 but nobody can argue that Shrek and Shrek 2
01:51:19 are terrible or bad.
01:51:21 They're stupid if they do.
01:51:24 Yeah.
01:51:26 Yeah.
01:51:28 Ooh, what are some of your favorite movies, Hippo?
01:51:31 Are you into movies?
01:51:33 I'm not actually into movies that much,
01:51:36 mostly because I don't like sitting down
01:51:39 and not being able to just leave.
01:51:41 Like, with a TV show...
01:51:43 Yeah, that's a big part of why I didn't get into movies
01:51:45 for a long time.
01:51:47 There was the last hour, maybe,
01:51:50 or 30 minutes or something,
01:51:53 and if you don't want to watch another one,
01:51:55 it's easy to just stop.
01:51:57 But the movie, it doesn't feel right to pause a movie
01:52:00 and then come back to it,
01:52:02 especially since DVDs, the early DVDs,
01:52:04 they didn't save your place.
01:52:06 They used to. They now do,
01:52:08 but they didn't use to,
01:52:10 and you couldn't really just leave it
01:52:13 until another day.
01:52:15 Yeah, movies.
01:52:17 I like Reservoir Dogs.
01:52:20 I like A Terminator.
01:52:23 I like...
01:52:25 I don't know. I like Alien 1.
01:52:27 I haven't seen that many,
01:52:29 but I have seen a lot of good classics.
01:52:32 A lot of animated movies.
01:52:34 I like a lot of Disney stuff.
01:52:37 What's your favorite Disney?
01:52:40 Ooh.
01:52:43 The favorite.
01:52:46 I like Lilo and Stitch.
01:52:48 Oh, that is a good one.
01:52:50 Yeah, I think...
01:52:52 It's hard,
01:52:54 because every time I think of my favorite,
01:52:56 I forget...
01:52:58 I did mention this before.
01:53:00 I forget all the other ones.
01:53:02 I can only think of Hercules because
01:53:04 I just listened to the Munchie podcast
01:53:06 and he said he liked Hercules.
01:53:08 I also like Hercules a lot.
01:53:10 I like Hercules a lot more,
01:53:12 but I can't remember.
01:53:14 But I think my favorite animated movie
01:53:16 is The Brave Little Toaster,
01:53:18 which I know Jesse is a fan of.
01:53:20 Oh, yeah, you mentioned this.
01:53:22 You're a huge fan of The Brave Little Toaster.
01:53:24 Yeah, Brave Little Toaster 2 and 3
01:53:26 were...
01:53:28 Disney took the sequel,
01:53:30 the rest of the sequels,
01:53:32 which are not even slightly as good.
01:53:34 Brave Little Toaster 1
01:53:36 is like a super amazing adventure
01:53:38 and you definitely see it.
01:53:40 It's the grace...
01:53:42 Yeah.
01:53:44 It's like a meatloaf song
01:53:46 in the middle of the movie.
01:53:48 It's awesome.
01:53:50 Have you seen it?
01:53:52 Yeah, I saw the first one probably
01:53:54 like three or four times,
01:53:56 and then I know I saw the second and third
01:53:58 and I remember even as a kid being like,
01:54:00 these suck!
01:54:02 They just kind of did the same thing again,
01:54:04 but with none of the emotions.
01:54:06 Yeah.
01:54:08 And the music, I think...
01:54:10 I'm not sure,
01:54:12 but I think the music in Brave Little Toaster
01:54:14 made me interested in becoming a musician
01:54:16 down the line.
01:54:18 Because I just love those songs so much.
01:54:20 I had the old VHS tape
01:54:22 and I would go to the songs part,
01:54:24 any of the songs,
01:54:26 apart from the first one, which is sort of a sing-song thing.
01:54:28 But like the techno one at the end
01:54:30 with all the high-tech computers,
01:54:32 I would get to that point
01:54:34 and rewind and listen to it again,
01:54:36 and I would dance all the time.
01:54:38 This is my favorite song ever.
01:54:40 I love that fucking movie.
01:54:42 Yeah, oh man.
01:54:44 I'm just looking at the soundtrack.
01:54:46 I was trying to see
01:54:48 if anyone...
01:54:50 They have the spooky one in the middle.
01:54:52 Yeah.
01:54:54 I just remember how much,
01:54:56 like, Worthless is like a legit
01:54:58 classic rock song.
01:55:00 It's like a full-on,
01:55:02 full-on or something.
01:55:04 It's great. Good music.
01:55:06 Cool movie.
01:55:08 So, recently...
01:55:10 I guess not too recently
01:55:12 at this point, but
01:55:14 you kind of got into anime
01:55:16 through the PCP, yeah?
01:55:18 Yeah.
01:55:20 Before I met
01:55:22 you and Nate and all that,
01:55:24 I had watched a few anime, I think.
01:55:26 Well, I've watched Naruto Bleach in One Piece
01:55:28 and Lucky Star
01:55:30 and that's about it.
01:55:32 I think I watched
01:55:34 On a Guy Teacher or something weird
01:55:36 as well.
01:55:38 But I've never really
01:55:40 gotten into it
01:55:42 aside from liking One Piece so much
01:55:44 that it's my favorite thing.
01:55:46 But you're a huge manga guy, though, right?
01:55:48 Or much bigger of a manga guy.
01:55:50 Only because
01:55:52 I stopped watching the anime because
01:55:54 the manga was coming out quicker.
01:55:56 I don't just mean of One Piece,
01:55:58 but you seem to have read a lot
01:56:00 of the long-running
01:56:02 great manga. You've read Bakumon
01:56:04 in I-Shield 21 and...
01:56:06 Once I started reading the manga
01:56:08 of One Piece and stuff
01:56:10 and Naruto and Bleach,
01:56:12 I think I...
01:56:14 I didn't read the manga of Death Note.
01:56:16 I was a fan of Death Note as well, anime.
01:56:18 But on those sites,
01:56:20 I saw all these things. I was like,
01:56:22 I'm bored. I'll read I-Shield 21
01:56:24 and it just so happened to be the fucking
01:56:26 thing I've ever seen in terms of sports
01:56:28 manga. And then there's
01:56:30 there's a...
01:56:32 What did you say, Bakumon?
01:56:34 I think it was just because those ones were like
01:56:36 high up on the popular
01:56:38 list next to One Piece.
01:56:40 At a certain time, I was like, oh cool,
01:56:42 I'll check it out. I actually
01:56:44 read Kimi Nii Torokai
01:56:46 as well because that was up there for a while.
01:56:50 How did it... did it frustrate
01:56:52 you to no end while reading it?
01:56:54 That the two never fucking
01:56:56 hooked up for so fucking long?
01:56:58 I think I actually
01:57:00 gave up of reading it, but it was kind of
01:57:02 cute.
01:57:04 There's quite a lot of
01:57:06 manga I kind of forget about that I've
01:57:08 read. Like Ichigo 100%.
01:57:10 I think I was into
01:57:12 that sort of romance sort of stuff for a while.
01:57:14 That was cool, except
01:57:16 it wasn't because it took too long
01:57:18 for anything to happen.
01:57:20 Did you ever get into like Negima
01:57:22 or Love Hina or any of those?
01:57:26 Love Hina, I got into the dating
01:57:28 sim that was around. The Flash
01:57:30 dating sim of Love Hina. I didn't know what Love Hina
01:57:32 was, but it was a dating sim
01:57:34 and it was like, ugh,
01:57:36 the girls, you date them.
01:57:38 Like a fan made pornographic dating
01:57:40 sim, right?
01:57:42 I don't think I ever got to the porn part
01:57:44 if there was.
01:57:46 But yeah, it was probably fan made. I didn't know
01:57:48 anything about it, but it was really shitty
01:57:50 looking and it was a really shitty sort of flash
01:57:52 game with gradients everywhere.
01:57:56 You know, the sort of flash gradients.
01:57:58 Yeah. So what
01:58:00 animes are you into now?
01:58:02 I'm going to go ahead and guess the same ones
01:58:04 the rest of the PCP are into, which is
01:58:06 all the Gainax shows.
01:58:08 Yeah, there's Cowboy Bebop,
01:58:10 Space Dandy, Killer Kill,
01:58:12 Gurren Lagann, Gurren Lagoon,
01:58:16 Neon Genesis
01:58:18 Ava, and
01:58:20 what else?
01:58:22 It's basically just stuff that I've heard you say
01:58:24 is considered
01:58:26 really a classic.
01:58:28 And I felt like I wanted to get into all the classics
01:58:30 because they're at least guaranteed to be
01:58:32 good. Like I didn't want to go into
01:58:34 experimenting.
01:58:36 I think it's something to do
01:58:38 with the kinds of people
01:58:40 we all are and the kinds of shows
01:58:42 that Gainax makes, that
01:58:44 there's definitely a correlation there
01:58:46 because we all love Gainax shows.
01:58:48 Like we all love Ava, we all love
01:58:50 Killer Kill and Gurren Lagoon.
01:58:52 I guess Nate doesn't love Killer Kill that much, but like
01:58:54 he's been a weirdo
01:58:56 about that. He clearly
01:58:58 would like it. He just feels that Gurren Lagoon
01:59:00 is my baby and it's similar.
01:59:02 Fuck it. Stupid.
01:59:04 Well, what did you think of, did you see
01:59:06 Fully Coolie?
01:59:08 Oh yeah, I saw Fully Coolie as well. That was good.
01:59:10 I didn't get it, but I like it.
01:59:12 Something about
01:59:14 those shows, it's just
01:59:16 like that studio
01:59:18 the way they make shows
01:59:20 because I mean those are all popular, but they're not like
01:59:22 you know, everyone
01:59:24 loves them and yet within our chat
01:59:26 everyone loves them.
01:59:28 Like there's no dissenting opinion
01:59:30 about Gainax shows
01:59:32 in our chat. And like there's kind of a
01:59:34 period at the start of
01:59:36 2015
01:59:38 where like
01:59:40 we all simultaneously
01:59:42 watched like a bunch of them
01:59:44 because it was like you and Jesse
01:59:46 both watched Killer Kill at like
01:59:48 the same time.
01:59:50 I think it was, I don't know
01:59:52 whether it was me.
01:59:54 I feel like my decision, oh yeah
01:59:56 I watched Gun Buster and Die Buster
01:59:58 as well and K-On, I forgot.
02:00:00 Yeah, well because K-On was
02:00:02 like I definitely remember that
02:00:04 I got you to start watching K-On
02:00:06 and then Jesse started watching K-On
02:00:08 and then
02:00:10 I as a result of that
02:00:12 made my K-On video
02:00:14 like because you guys were watching it
02:00:16 it got me watching it again
02:00:18 whenever any of us
02:00:20 are like revisiting something and talking about it
02:00:22 in the chat you get all hyped about it
02:00:24 like if you or anyone
02:00:26 were playing a game that I had made a review on
02:00:28 and you'd never played it before
02:00:30 and you were talking about it and be like yeah cool
02:00:32 it's this
02:00:34 sort of thing because like I remember I was watching
02:00:36 Ava and talking about it in the chat and Jesse
02:00:38 was like oh shit Ava's so cool and then
02:00:40 I feel like that prompted him to go
02:00:42 on his crazy Ava binge
02:00:44 and start writing fan sexy stuff.
02:00:46 That did happen. Yeah it was
02:00:48 all like early
02:00:50 2014, early 2015
02:00:52 there was this period where we were all kind of
02:00:54 watching the same anime like you watched
02:00:56 Kill La Kill, Jesse watched it and then
02:00:58 as a result of you guys watching it
02:01:00 I watched it again and then
02:01:02 that also inspired my
02:01:04 Guru on the Gun vs. Kill La because then you watched Guru on the Gun
02:01:06 and so I watched both shows back to back
02:01:08 and wrote that video
02:01:10 comparing them and then
02:01:12 you started watching Ava and I started
02:01:14 doing my Ava videos not long after that
02:01:16 so like pretty much whatever
02:01:18 you were watching we all
02:01:20 ended up watching at the same time
02:01:22 and that sort of
02:01:24 spawned some of those old videos
02:01:26 it was great
02:01:28 it was a great time and then
02:01:30 it kind of stopped I guess because
02:01:32 we watched all the...
02:01:34 the run out of cool anime
02:01:38 I guess because of the fact that
02:01:40 those are all shows that both Nate and Jesse
02:01:42 also know about then
02:01:44 it's easier for me to be like
02:01:46 we all kind of like Ava so of course
02:01:48 you had to watch it or Cowboy Bebop
02:01:52 it was like me because I was
02:01:54 the new but I was new to it
02:01:56 and you were like you were all
02:01:58 feeling my new good
02:02:00 vibes about it
02:02:02 and not too long later like
02:02:04 DeVoo watched all those shows once he joined the chat
02:02:06 because like we kept talking about all of them
02:02:08 you know
02:02:10 well I don't know I guess he'd already seen Kill La Kill
02:02:12 and Girl in the Gaunt but he definitely watched
02:02:14 Cowboy Bebop and Ava like once he started
02:02:16 hanging out with us and shit
02:02:18 but yeah like
02:02:20 I guess that's like the TPC canon
02:02:22 is like all the guy next shows
02:02:24 and Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy
02:02:26 have you not watched Samurai Shampoo yet?
02:02:28 I have not
02:02:30 but you should probably
02:02:32 watch that one because it's the
02:02:34 it's like the third
02:02:36 in the trilogy of Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy
02:02:38 and Samurai Shampoo
02:02:40 or it's the one in the middle
02:02:42 which me and Jesse are both long time fans of
02:02:44 though Jesse
02:02:46 has said he can't watch Samurai Shampoo
02:02:48 the one that Jesse really likes
02:02:50 the ninja one
02:02:52 there's a ninja one
02:02:54 that Jesse really likes
02:02:56 I forget it
02:02:58 a ninja
02:03:00 oh ninja scroll
02:03:02 yeah the movie
02:03:04 oh is it a movie? well I'll watch it
02:03:06 it's like a movie from the
02:03:08 mid 90's that's just like nothing but violence
02:03:10 and kicking gas
02:03:12 it's great and tits
02:03:14 tits violence and kicking gas
02:03:16 um
02:03:18 yeah
02:03:20 it's harder for me to like
02:03:22 get you to watch
02:03:24 other anime that I like
02:03:26 because
02:03:28 it's hard to get
02:03:30 everyone into something
02:03:32 I feel like I'm the only guy
02:03:34 in the PCP who
02:03:36 people say this thing is good
02:03:38 and I immediately want to check it out
02:03:40 everyone else seems to really need to have
02:03:42 their arm twisted
02:03:44 in order to get into something
02:03:46 yeah me more than most
02:03:48 I feel like my time is
02:03:50 precious even though I don't do much with it
02:03:52 a lot of the time
02:03:54 I have so many other things to
02:03:56 get into that I already know that I want to
02:03:58 get into why would I get into this new thing
02:04:00 you know
02:04:02 I mean I totally get it
02:04:04 with like you say
02:04:06 berserk is great and you would really like it
02:04:08 I'm like sure
02:04:10 yeah we got you to read berserk I forgot
02:04:12 then I eventually did and it's the greatest
02:04:14 fucking thing ever
02:04:16 well that was one that like
02:04:18 I very deliberately wanted you
02:04:20 to read berserk because
02:04:22 knowing your taste I felt like it was perfect
02:04:24 for you
02:04:26 because it's got like you know
02:04:28 it's fantasy with skeletons
02:04:30 and it's got this dark plot
02:04:32 and this like really strong main character
02:04:34 and you like shows like Breaking Bad
02:04:36 and stuff like that and I felt like it's along those
02:04:38 lines in a way
02:04:40 so I felt like
02:04:42 you needed to read berserk
02:04:44 and I was not going to stop
02:04:46 talking about it until you did it
02:04:48 yeah there are actually quite a lot of like
02:04:50 really
02:04:52 saddening moments like not saddening but like
02:04:54 really
02:04:56 like you just feel like shit after
02:04:58 like that bit where there's like
02:05:00 that how do you explain it
02:05:02 it's like a big sack of
02:05:04 ooze and they throw the women in it
02:05:06 and they get
02:05:08 raped through the ooze and then they
02:05:10 spawn demon babies
02:05:12 and that's just a fucking
02:05:14 and it's like oh
02:05:16 disgusting but I kind of like it
02:05:18 there's definitely a period
02:05:20 like I guess it's like right around when shirk
02:05:22 showed up and like
02:05:24 it was kind of becoming like a little too
02:05:26 magical girly and then I think maybe
02:05:28 he wanted to like throw it back in the other direction
02:05:30 and just made like a lot of rapes happen
02:05:32 like in a row and it was like
02:05:34 this has gotten exponentially
02:05:36 rapier
02:05:38 um yeah
02:05:40 there's a lot of rape in berserk
02:05:42 I remember reading this like
02:05:44 one of my first exposures to berserk was this like
02:05:46 4chan copypasta was just
02:05:48 this guy going on a rant about how he was like
02:05:50 every single fucking
02:05:52 chapter I see some new kind of dick
02:05:54 it's like mirage just sits around dreaming up
02:05:56 new kinds of demon dicks I've seen every
02:05:58 kind of dick imaginable raping
02:06:00 every kind of human imaginable
02:06:02 and I was like yeah that's
02:06:04 that's pretty accurate that's what berserk
02:06:06 is
02:06:08 myriad colors phantom dicks
02:06:10 uh
02:06:14 so I guess that's
02:06:16 all the animes
02:06:18 what's your favorite anime
02:06:20 what's the best one I guess one piece
02:06:24 well I don't know what yeah the manga
02:06:26 the manga is the best one ever I don't know about the anime
02:06:28 I mean I watched like
02:06:30 I don't know how many episodes there are
02:06:32 I guess 300 I watched
02:06:34 400 I don't know a lot of
02:06:36 episodes of that anime because I didn't know
02:06:38 like anime could be more than just
02:06:40 what that show was which was kind of
02:06:42 limited like it it looked like
02:06:44 the manga but it wasn't as
02:06:46 well produced as
02:06:48 other anime that I've seen since
02:06:50 um so I don't know whether I'd like
02:06:52 that the most but I think
02:06:56 it's either Gurren Lagann
02:06:58 plus the movie the second
02:07:00 movie with the giant guy
02:07:02 giant Kamina space Kamina
02:07:04 that's important you need that I don't know
02:07:06 why that didn't know why that wasn't wasn't
02:07:08 in the show because I kept saying I kept
02:07:10 seeing that that scene
02:07:12 of him you know
02:07:14 be a huge Kamina and he wasn't
02:07:16 in the show and I was like oh what
02:07:18 happened um
02:07:20 so it's either that or
02:07:22 uh K-On I think
02:07:24 yeah
02:07:26 I'm not I'm not sure probably
02:07:28 both together
02:07:30 I gotta talk about this in this podcast
02:07:32 because I don't know when else I'd get the opportunity
02:07:34 the
02:07:36 like the specific
02:07:38 instance that caused me to rewatch
02:07:40 K-On and write about it and actually
02:07:42 I think this instance is what made K-On
02:07:44 into my number one favorite anime and it's all
02:07:46 because of you because
02:07:48 of Otacon
02:07:50 2014 because
02:07:52 I mean not Otacon uh BronyCon
02:07:54 2014 because that's the year you didn't get to go
02:07:56 and you went to
02:07:58 uh that camp
02:08:00 thing you were talking about where you take care of disabled kids
02:08:02 um
02:08:04 and there's a
02:08:06 two-part episode of K-On
02:08:08 in season two it's episodes four and five
02:08:10 where in episode four
02:08:12 um all the older girls
02:08:14 go on this trip to
02:08:16 oh what was it Kyoto I think
02:08:18 yeah um
02:08:20 yeah they go on a trip to Kyoto and they all hang out
02:08:22 and like
02:08:24 you know they're telling all these stories to each other
02:08:26 and like they come up with these
02:08:28 memes with within themselves
02:08:30 like where they all just up at night saying skull
02:08:32 and lycopene
02:08:34 for some reason and uh
02:08:36 it's just it's
02:08:38 it's really adorable but like uh
02:08:40 Azusa the youngest member
02:08:42 didn't get to go um
02:08:44 cause she was in you know another grade
02:08:46 so then in the next episode we see what
02:08:48 she was doing like at home
02:08:50 with the with her other two friends
02:08:52 and like you know like she keeps getting
02:08:54 texts from the other girls and she's like
02:08:56 totally jealous that she didn't get to go
02:08:58 but uh you know she has her own little adventure
02:09:00 and like
02:09:02 the parallel between the
02:09:04 horseshoe crew and and you
02:09:06 not getting to go and you being the youngest
02:09:08 member and you having to do something else
02:09:10 it was like spot on
02:09:12 how accurate it was you know
02:09:14 we came back with our memes are
02:09:16 the lord of shit mountain meme
02:09:18 that we were all saying and stuff and
02:09:20 and then I literally
02:09:22 just thinking about this like once I
02:09:24 realized cause I had already been
02:09:26 thinking that our adventure
02:09:28 reminded me of episode four like when we
02:09:30 were up all night like saying these things and giggling
02:09:32 I was like oh this is just like that scene from K-On
02:09:34 and then once I realized
02:09:36 that you were Azunyan I remember like screaming
02:09:38 in the chat about it like oh my god
02:09:40 Gibbons Azunyan and
02:09:42 I just started fucking crying
02:09:44 like I just started losing my shit
02:09:46 all over the place over the fact
02:09:48 that I had just lived out a
02:09:50 K-On arc and like
02:09:52 that legitimately was like such a powerful
02:09:54 feeling that I was like K-On might be
02:09:56 the best anime ever
02:09:58 and then I watched it again
02:10:00 and I cried during those episodes
02:10:02 just thinking about it like I actually
02:10:04 cried a lot at the like
02:10:06 I was a little like
02:10:08 I think I was on painkillers at the time cause
02:10:10 I had broken my foot I don't know if that made me
02:10:12 more emotional but I like consistently
02:10:14 kept crying while watching K-On
02:10:16 and thinking about you
02:10:18 and how you were Azunyan and I kept
02:10:20 messaging you like as I was watching the show I was like
02:10:22 everything about Azunyan is what you are
02:10:24 she's into Dad Rock
02:10:26 her parents are musicians
02:10:28 yeah I was gonna say like
02:10:30 she made a reference to Jimi Hendrix
02:10:32 and no she made a difference
02:10:34 a reference to Jimi Page which is the lead
02:10:36 guitarist of Led Zipna it was like
02:10:38 whoa nobody does that everybody talks about Hendrix
02:10:40 nobody talks about Page she's the coolest
02:10:42 I like her so yeah
02:10:44 even on that level
02:10:46 as a character I identify
02:10:48 with her more than the others
02:10:50 I had said out that I thought
02:10:52 um
02:10:54 Jesse
02:10:56 I think I said Jesse was Yui
02:10:58 and that cause the way he
02:11:00 acted around you was like Yui and Azunyan
02:11:02 where Jesse always like acted
02:11:04 very like protective of you and like you were
02:11:06 his little brother and like you're his favorite
02:11:08 kind of thing
02:11:10 and it just really reminded me of Yui and Azusa
02:11:12 and like Nate is obviously
02:11:14 fuckin
02:11:16 Ritsu and Ben would be
02:11:18 Mio but that's not really a good
02:11:20 comparison and then I think I had myself
02:11:22 as Sumugi
02:11:24 and Tom
02:11:26 as Notoka
02:11:28 and I guess now we have Jeff so he has to be
02:11:30 like
02:11:32 Jun-chan I guess
02:11:34 I don't know
02:11:36 I don't know who he would be I guess uh
02:11:38 Mage can be Yui
02:11:40 why not I just
02:11:42 I had to go through all of them but yeah
02:11:44 it was just really striking
02:11:46 and I kept that was what got you to watch
02:11:48 Kaon I think was that I kept saying
02:11:50 uh like I kept saying
02:11:52 you're just like Azusa and then you decided
02:11:54 to watch it on that basis and then we
02:11:56 kind of like finished it up around the
02:11:58 same time and uh
02:12:00 and you got to the movie which was in London and it was
02:12:02 like literally your hometown
02:12:04 yeah the place
02:12:06 where they play on the big grass thing
02:12:08 is actually a place that I know
02:12:10 so there was a few places like that
02:12:12 but I just like oh I know that I know
02:12:14 that sign I know that corner they obviously
02:12:16 went to London to get reference
02:12:18 images which is really cool
02:12:20 yeah it's a perfect show
02:12:22 it's a
02:12:24 it's a 10 out of 10
02:12:26 it's the best anime ever
02:12:28 makes me uh makes my
02:12:30 makes my pee pee go poo poo
02:12:32 I guess
02:12:34 that's a good thing
02:12:40 yeah
02:12:42 that's a good question hippo
02:12:44 what makes your pee pee go poo poo
02:12:46 uh
02:12:48 a titi
02:12:58 that's a perfect answer
02:13:02 tell me about your waifus
02:13:04 oh yeah
02:13:06 um
02:13:08 I talked about this a bit in the waifus cast I think
02:13:10 I can't remember
02:13:12 I have a bunch
02:13:14 yeah that's like the second one
02:13:16 yeah
02:13:18 um there's a vriska
02:13:20 who is my number one I think
02:13:22 yeah vriska from homestuck
02:13:24 diamond tiara from my little pony
02:13:26 I try to collect one from each thing I like
02:13:28 a lot um
02:13:30 I think uh
02:13:32 who else is there
02:13:34 it's Marceline from Adventure Time
02:13:36 uh
02:13:38 uh and Undyne from
02:13:40 Undyne from Undertale
02:13:42 and Raven from Teen Titans
02:13:44 you I think you
02:13:46 you did mention at one point that I
02:13:48 I tend towards gray girls
02:13:50 and it just so happens that I did love
02:13:52 Raven as well
02:13:54 so yeah all of them are either like
02:13:56 other than diamond tiara they are all
02:13:58 literally gray skinned
02:14:00 how the fuck does that happen
02:14:02 that's like the oldest coincidence
02:14:04 I mean they all like
02:14:06 they'll have similarities in their
02:14:08 personality that even if they weren't
02:14:10 gray you would understand why you liked
02:14:12 all of them but the point
02:14:14 stands that they are all gray skinned
02:14:16 uh with the exception of
02:14:18 the pink pony
02:14:20 yeah who just so happens
02:14:22 to have a gray skin
02:14:24 counterpart that I'm not into
02:14:26 as much
02:14:28 a weird missed opportunity there
02:14:32 but I guess the exception proves the rule
02:14:34 yeah so my wife who's
02:14:36 if you know those characters
02:14:38 you can tell that they're all bitches
02:14:40 they're all bitchy they're all
02:14:42 powerful strong independent women
02:14:44 they boss
02:14:46 people around and I guess
02:14:48 I like that in a woman I'm not sure
02:14:50 oh my god have you seen
02:14:52 panty and stocking with garter belt
02:14:54 I know I didn't
02:14:56 oh I think you would really like that show
02:14:58 I think you will like all the girls in that
02:15:00 show
02:15:02 all bitchy powerful crazy women
02:15:04 I can't
02:15:06 think of which one will be your favorite because I don't
02:15:08 I don't know if it'd be panty or stocking
02:15:10 it'd probably be one of the demon girls
02:15:12 scanty and knee socks
02:15:14 because they're more of like the domineering
02:15:16 type they both believe in like
02:15:18 absolute order
02:15:20 but they're like the bad guys
02:15:22 because the main characters are all about anarchy
02:15:24 but they're the good guys
02:15:26 it's great you will love that fucking show
02:15:28 okay I
02:15:30 definitely guarantee it's the same director as
02:15:32 girl in the gun and kill I kill
02:15:34 and uh
02:15:36 Davoo's a big fan Jesse hated it
02:15:38 but he only watched the first two episodes and he watched
02:15:40 them dubbed and he really
02:15:42 hated that the girls
02:15:44 swear constantly and it sounds
02:15:46 terrible
02:15:48 it does sound terrible dubbed I looked at it
02:15:50 um well because of the swearing
02:15:52 yeah that's the funny thing about it
02:15:54 is that like people constantly say that
02:15:56 you like that's one of those shows that everyone's like
02:15:58 oh you have to watch it dubbed because the swearing
02:16:00 is so funny and I'm like no the swearing
02:16:02 sounds gross in English
02:16:04 because what makes it funny in Japanese
02:16:06 is that they use English
02:16:08 swear words randomly
02:16:10 in their sentences and it's really
02:16:12 fucking hilarious because they'll say like
02:16:14 oh do that
02:16:16 you know and it's really fucking funny
02:16:18 one of my favorite things in anime
02:16:20 is Japanese voice actors
02:16:22 saying English words
02:16:24 yeah I just love that so much
02:16:26 they do it constantly and it's mostly bitch
02:16:28 they'll say
02:16:30 bitch
02:16:32 like what the fuck
02:16:34 happens a lot
02:16:36 it's great I find that way funnier
02:16:38 than some like
02:16:40 American girl just going what the fuck
02:16:42 you fucking bitch
02:16:44 and I'm just like oh come on
02:16:46 that's tacky
02:16:48 you know
02:16:50 yeah
02:16:52 I should watch that then that's one on the list
02:16:54 yes it's
02:16:56 pretty short so you could probably do it in like a day
02:17:00 but it's got that
02:17:02 old school cartoon
02:17:04 episode setup where each episode is
02:17:06 like two 15 minute parts
02:17:08 that have like an opening title
02:17:10 card type thing like Ed and Nettie used to
02:17:12 have and stuff like that
02:17:14 it's pretty cool
02:17:16 people always talk about it's very influenced by
02:17:18 western cartoons but not to the extent
02:17:20 that people make it out like it is
02:17:22 people make it out like that's all the show is
02:17:24 is like a reference to western cartoons
02:17:26 but it is it's definitely
02:17:28 heavily influenced by them and it's
02:17:30 a good
02:17:34 yeah
02:17:36 yeah I'm still here
02:17:38 that's where you might have cut out again cause DeVoo
02:17:40 joined in and I'm like oh no
02:17:42 it's gonna be just like when Nate joined in
02:17:44 it feels stable
02:17:46 we can keep going
02:17:48 we've been going strong for a good little while
02:17:52 so
02:17:54 you have made the remark
02:17:56 that you think that you're not a good
02:17:58 drawer
02:18:00 yeah
02:18:02 yeah I mean
02:18:04 the draw costs
02:18:06 both of them I'm ashamed of
02:18:08 because the first one I was being like haha
02:18:10 I'm bad but then
02:18:12 they were all so good it was like
02:18:14 why did I do that why didn't I try
02:18:16 like even if I tried my best
02:18:18 it wouldn't have been as good as them
02:18:20 at least I would have looked not terrible bad
02:18:22 and then the second one I thought
02:18:24 I'll try really good but then everyone was
02:18:26 like hilarious and interesting
02:18:28 and I was like damn
02:18:30 I should have been hilarious and interesting for this one
02:18:32 I just fucked up both times
02:18:34 so people don't know
02:18:36 unless they see my deviant art
02:18:38 what I'm good at drawing at
02:18:40 I don't know I'm not
02:18:42 like I used to be really good
02:18:44 I mean I could draw like a
02:18:46 really good life drawing of a person
02:18:48 I have lots of good
02:18:50 drawings that I've done
02:18:52 but when it comes to a tablet
02:18:54 I'm generally just sort of
02:18:56 fucking I'm bad I'm worse
02:18:58 I gotta learn
02:19:00 how to use a tablet better
02:19:02 even though I've made three animated films with it
02:19:04 but you said
02:19:06 that's why you like animation because it hides
02:19:08 how bad you are at drawing
02:19:10 yeah yeah you can
02:19:12 you can draw some like
02:19:14 my first film the fish at the door one
02:19:16 the reason all the frames wobble
02:19:18 so much is because I drew the first guy
02:19:20 I was like
02:19:22 it doesn't look right
02:19:24 it doesn't look good I can't keep him on
02:19:26 screen for more than one second
02:19:28 but I gotta so I just drew the same frame
02:19:30 over again and made it loop
02:19:32 so that it was deliberately wobbly
02:19:34 and then it was cool
02:19:36 yeah it was adorable
02:19:38 yeah people liked it
02:19:40 yeah yeah
02:19:42 yeah yeah
02:19:44 huge
02:19:46 I don't know why I keep
02:19:48 lapsing into gudra these days
02:19:50 I think a gudra bit me
02:19:52 and I've just been like
02:19:54 like wear gudraing
02:19:56 got a weird gooey rash on your back
02:19:58 yeah oh god
02:20:00 oh gudra
02:20:02 that's disgusting
02:20:06 oh my god it's like a
02:20:08 ren and stimpy image in my head now
02:20:10 oh no
02:20:14 uh
02:20:16 I always liked your art style
02:20:18 I still think your drawings are good
02:20:20 I liked your gudra
02:20:22 I liked the face on it
02:20:24 I described it as a gormless expression
02:20:26 I think
02:20:28 yeah I mean I don't think
02:20:30 I'm bad at drawing I just
02:20:32 like in comparison to people
02:20:34 like Ben even
02:20:36 people like Ben I mean Tom and major
02:20:38 like they can draw like pro
02:20:40 fashionals and Ben's like really
02:20:42 got a unique style that's very
02:20:44 Ben and it works and it's
02:20:46 cool and then I've got mine which is
02:20:48 like it's a style
02:20:50 but it's very easily
02:20:52 replicatable I think
02:20:54 because it's simple I don't know I could
02:20:56 tell your style immediately when I see it
02:20:58 like every time you ever drew
02:21:00 like a pony character
02:21:02 I would know that you had drawn it
02:21:04 oh well yeah now that you say that I guess
02:21:06 that is true my pony Osea was
02:21:08 very different from everyone else's
02:21:10 because I drew it myself
02:21:12 and it was good
02:21:14 both you and Ben had that
02:21:16 like that kind of style where like
02:21:18 because me and Jesse got like you've drawn
02:21:20 both mine and Jesse's
02:21:22 ponies I think in your style
02:21:24 for like use in different
02:21:26 things and
02:21:28 I draw your guy
02:21:30 once for the analysis
02:21:32 compilation and then I made a bunch
02:21:34 of poses for Jesse for a horseshoe
02:21:36 finale when he wanted to act
02:21:38 like me which was cool
02:21:40 yeah
02:21:42 yeah
02:21:44 I had to stop myself before I
02:21:46 go full goo
02:21:48 you
02:21:50 you're trying
02:21:52 your main career goal
02:21:54 is to be a YouTuber right like that's the
02:21:56 one you want to pursue the most
02:21:58 yeah
02:22:00 I
02:22:02 I mean I'm
02:22:04 it's kind of weird because like the
02:22:06 communities I have I could become
02:22:08 an actual animator or
02:22:10 a writer or a musician if I just
02:22:12 went in one direction or the other
02:22:14 I was already a pretty good musician by the time
02:22:16 I was considering going for an animation
02:22:18 degree
02:22:20 and it was like what do I do do I do
02:22:22 music do I go on the road or become
02:22:24 a band guy or do I do animation and do
02:22:26 all that I don't know whether I like
02:22:28 animation so I had to make a decision
02:22:30 then I chose animation and now
02:22:32 after doing three years of it I'm not sure
02:22:34 I would like to do that for my entire life although
02:22:36 I could I just and then
02:22:38 YouTube became a possibility
02:22:40 that I was getting better at and I made
02:22:42 a few videos and they were good and I really like
02:22:44 them and I think I could be better I could be
02:22:46 one of those 900k
02:22:48 sub weirdos
02:22:50 in the gaming community
02:22:52 like if I try this like
02:22:54 I have opportunities and there's too
02:22:56 many good ones to pick and it's kind of hard
02:22:58 to decide but I guess YouTube right
02:23:00 now I'm doing YouTube
02:23:02 while I wait for
02:23:04 potential other things
02:23:06 but I want YouTube to
02:23:08 if it if while I'm
02:23:10 waiting to do other things my YouTube grows
02:23:12 to a point where I can say okay
02:23:14 that's what I'm gonna do and that's what
02:23:16 I'll do
02:23:18 well I think what's great
02:23:20 about YouTube is that it's
02:23:22 pretty easy to imagine how
02:23:24 all of those talents can be used
02:23:26 in YouTube videos
02:23:28 like you know you can
02:23:30 pretty easily like incorporate
02:23:32 animations and music and all that
02:23:34 into a video we all just
02:23:36 saw I mean Nate didn't make
02:23:38 the music itself but what he did with
02:23:40 that Kenny Logan song and his
02:23:42 new video was like yeah we should
02:23:44 be this is a good idea like
02:23:46 this is a good way to make a funny YouTube
02:23:48 video is to like
02:23:50 if you can sing then sing in a
02:23:52 video you know if you can play guitar
02:23:54 find a way to get guitar in there
02:23:56 or like Yotam Perrell where
02:23:58 he does like his animations
02:24:00 with songs and shit and
02:24:02 and then just makes like whole albums out
02:24:04 of nowhere really the
02:24:06 YouTube is most likely
02:24:08 the best
02:24:10 like out of the best decision
02:24:12 to go for but
02:24:14 it's been slow so I don't know I just
02:24:16 I just need to be making more videos
02:24:18 more quickly and putting
02:24:20 them on the internet yeah I think
02:24:22 that's like the the big fear
02:24:24 that I have like with or not fear
02:24:26 so much is like what I need to see with you
02:24:28 and Nate is like
02:24:30 we all kind of are
02:24:32 under this mindset of like we're never
02:24:34 gonna know for sure if you would be
02:24:36 successful until you get fast
02:24:38 because like if you
02:24:40 do put out like 30 videos
02:24:42 in a year and
02:24:44 you still don't get big
02:24:46 then it'll be like okay maybe
02:24:48 maybe it's not happening you know
02:24:50 but what it's only like two videos
02:24:52 a year like you did in the last year
02:24:54 that it's like well we can't really say
02:24:56 for sure until you know
02:24:58 we get a better read on the same with Nate
02:25:00 where it's like his channel is growing really slow
02:25:02 because he's putting out videos
02:25:04 really slow
02:25:06 and like
02:25:08 he's got more subs than me though that fuck
02:25:10 yeah
02:25:12 but then you've got like Jesse over there who's
02:25:14 puts out videos constantly and doesn't grow
02:25:16 but he has a huge
02:25:18 Patreon so like you know maybe
02:25:20 that maybe you guys will end up like that like it's really
02:25:22 hard to say but until you have enough
02:25:24 videos I don't think any
02:25:26 I just don't think we can judge it you know
02:25:28 that's why I'm trying to do
02:25:30 two per month until the end of the year to see what happens
02:25:32 yeah
02:25:34 I really gotta buckle down
02:25:36 yeah I'm looking forward to it
02:25:38 because
02:25:40 number one thing I want
02:25:42 in the world is
02:25:44 more best guy ever more
02:25:46 hypocrite
02:25:48 and more of my Japanese anime
02:25:50 as opposed to
02:25:52 more edless chess blogs
02:25:54 in blue glows
02:25:56 not that I don't enjoy those
02:25:58 but god damn it
02:26:00 I need to see everybody on top
02:26:02 of the world
02:26:04 not just me and Jeff
02:26:06 Jeff with his fucking
02:26:08 like 10 avenues of income
02:26:10 that he has now that son of a bitch
02:26:14 fucking Jeff
02:26:16 who is he
02:26:18 I don't know I can
02:26:20 I don't know him
02:26:22 we talked once about
02:26:24 about playing Game Boy Advance in bed
02:26:26 and that's it
02:26:28 that's true you haven't really talked to him
02:26:30 much at all
02:26:32 he makes too much money
02:26:34 and therefore he's
02:26:36 piece of shit
02:26:42 who are your favorite YouTubers
02:26:44 currently and of all time
02:26:48 currently
02:26:54 I don't know I really
02:26:56 I'm only really watching the
02:26:58 procrastinators plus
02:27:00 the Sleepycast
02:27:02 and
02:27:04 that Hosto and Guy Creparion
02:27:06 and Creparion's fun
02:27:08 but he's not like a really great YouTuber
02:27:10 right
02:27:12 yeah I don't know
02:27:14 I forget all of the ones that I like
02:27:16 all of the ones
02:27:18 I know you like
02:27:20 yeah go ahead
02:27:22 you said Yotam Peril
02:27:24 is a girl animator
02:27:26 yeah
02:27:28 he's cool I like his stuff I like
02:27:30 Hot Diggity Demon as well
02:27:32 really great animations like
02:27:34 ridiculously good for YouTube
02:27:36 he doesn't get paid enough
02:27:38 he puts way too much work
02:27:40 into his animations
02:27:42 they come out very
02:27:44 very rarely and I often
02:27:46 feel like
02:27:48 the quality of the writing
02:27:50 does not deserve the level of
02:27:52 animation he puts into them
02:27:54 I don't often find them that funny
02:27:56 I'm just like blown away
02:27:58 by how much effort he put into something
02:28:00 that is sometimes just weird
02:28:02 not even really funny
02:28:04 I guess
02:28:06 you commissioned an art piece from him
02:28:08 of Riska
02:28:10 I did he was doing commissions
02:28:12 and he never does those
02:28:14 so I paid him
02:28:16 a bunch of money
02:28:18 for Riska with a hippo
02:28:20 with a little hat
02:28:22 and that's cute and I love it
02:28:24 he's
02:28:26 I think it's just his art style and his animation skill
02:28:28 that I really like so much
02:28:30 um
02:28:32 in terms of favorite you oh
02:28:34 ABGM is probably my favorite YouTuber
02:28:36 because
02:28:38 he's got such a great
02:28:40 background
02:28:42 he's really charming and I love him
02:28:44 and he's still not shit
02:28:46 yeah
02:28:48 there was a portion
02:28:50 of ABGM
02:28:52 in episodes during which he was
02:28:54 filming his movie
02:28:56 that were sort of
02:28:58 I don't know but then afterwards
02:29:00 there was only like four or five of those
02:29:02 that were just sort of okay
02:29:04 but they were never bad
02:29:06 they always were decent enough
02:29:08 you know better than most
02:29:10 it's amazing that he's
02:29:12 gone so far I mean he's
02:29:14 clearly a genius
02:29:16 clearly got the
02:29:18 power
02:29:20 I know you used to be a big
02:29:22 total biscuit fan right
02:29:24 oh yeah I like total biscuit
02:29:26 he doesn't really make
02:29:28 he's never really made um
02:29:30 single videos that have like blown me away
02:29:32 I just really respect him as like a
02:29:34 journalist or not really a journalist
02:29:36 but like a commentator
02:29:38 like he has a lot of correct opinions
02:29:40 about lots of issues about gaming
02:29:42 news and stuff
02:29:44 I always love his content patch
02:29:46 I used to love listening to him
02:29:48 on the podcast because that was fun
02:29:50 but the podcast takes too long
02:29:52 and it's not that fun
02:29:54 not fun enough to waste like
02:29:56 three hours every week
02:29:58 right
02:30:00 but I like him he's really good
02:30:02 at the news thing
02:30:04 you used to be a big
02:30:06 Game Grumps fan right
02:30:08 oh yeah
02:30:10 yeah John Grumps is my favorite let's play
02:30:12 series of all time
02:30:14 I recently rewatched
02:30:16 basically all of it
02:30:18 which was kind of you know
02:30:20 I tried to watch from the very beginning
02:30:22 in order of playlists
02:30:24 um
02:30:26 and I got like
02:30:28 I got quite close to the end
02:30:30 I think I was like at Mario
02:30:32 for something
02:30:34 something that I didn't remember really
02:30:36 watching the first time
02:30:38 and then I got bored
02:30:40 but yeah that's like
02:30:42 a huge amount of my favorite comedy
02:30:44 comes from John Era Grumps
02:30:46 Dan Era Grumps is also great
02:30:48 but it feels different and
02:30:50 well you know actually now I think about it
02:30:52 that's also got a huge amount of hilarious moments
02:30:54 yeah
02:30:56 but we all kind of like Grumps is great
02:30:58 there was like a huge
02:31:00 mass exodus of TPC
02:31:02 members from watching Game Grumps
02:31:04 like at the start of this year
02:31:06 yeah they just
02:31:08 they were doing the fucking Mario Maker
02:31:10 thing and they got
02:31:12 they finished Bloodborne they did Mario Maker
02:31:14 and some of the game
02:31:16 that nobody cares about and they just kept doing
02:31:18 Mario Maker and it was boring
02:31:20 and we all gave up
02:31:22 and quit and I don't think any of us
02:31:24 have really gone back except to
02:31:26 occasionally look at the weird celebrity guests
02:31:28 that you've been getting
02:31:30 like that what's the guy
02:31:32 Stevo
02:31:34 I ended up listening to that
02:31:36 fucking Sanchez I don't want to get into that again
02:31:38 my Digi Rose fans are fucking
02:31:40 sick of hearing about that
02:31:44 but yeah
02:31:46 what happened I don't understand
02:31:48 yes it's weird
02:31:50 I mean
02:31:52 so much of that early
02:31:54 not early YouTube stuff but like
02:31:56 I think it was mostly the pony era
02:31:58 where
02:32:00 John Trun was amazing and Game Grumps was also
02:32:02 amazing and it was that really cool
02:32:04 and we were all like
02:32:06 you know that's why I used that banana
02:32:08 the banana shoe song at the end of the
02:32:10 brony con videos that I made
02:32:12 it was like oh yeah that's sort of
02:32:14 that's sort of a thing
02:32:16 that's sort of a pony thing
02:32:18 almost
02:32:20 banana shoes it's great
02:32:22 it's a classic
02:32:24 it takes you back to a bygone era
02:32:26 and really like
02:32:28 it's like yeah
02:32:30 times were once good
02:32:34 John Trun used to be great
02:32:36 Aaron used to be great
02:32:38 hell that he wasn't in that song
02:32:40 but Dan used to be great too
02:32:42 now they're all washed up
02:32:44 has been
02:32:46 although did you see that new video that Barry
02:32:48 made about Skyward Sword
02:32:50 that was pretty good
02:32:52 it's got a lot of that Barry
02:32:54 almost funny humor but it
02:32:56 it works I liked it
02:32:58 it was the best thing to come out of
02:33:00 the Game Grumps all year probably
02:33:02 yeah
02:33:04 but the whole Game Grumps
02:33:06 and John Trun being shit
02:33:08 it's sort of
02:33:10 changed the way I view
02:33:12 YouTube and it's less about
02:33:14 being a consumer of
02:33:16 stuff I mean I still watch a lot of
02:33:18 YouTube but like I feel less like
02:33:20 a consumer on YouTube
02:33:22 and more like a creator
02:33:24 where I'm probably the best guy I know
02:33:26 at what I do
02:33:28 aside from James Rolfe
02:33:30 I would definitely say that
02:33:32 it seems like for you and Nate
02:33:34 especially since you were both such big
02:33:36 John Trun fans like
02:33:38 him turning to shit in some ways
02:33:40 did more good than harm
02:33:42 because it like made it so there were shoes
02:33:44 that everyone kind of wanted to fill
02:33:46 you know
02:33:48 John Trun sucks now that means we can
02:33:50 we can now be
02:33:52 the new one you know like
02:33:54 he needs to be replaced we need to kick him
02:33:56 off his throne let's get
02:33:58 up there
02:34:00 would you say that it inspired you
02:34:02 in that way
02:34:04 I'm not sure whether it would
02:34:06 like it was a direct inspiration I think
02:34:08 it was just sad but I felt good about
02:34:10 myself in general
02:34:12 at the same time I don't know whether it's directly
02:34:14 related but I feel better
02:34:16 about my own videos
02:34:18 in general because I'm like yeah
02:34:20 because people like you
02:34:22 and Victor have said you know I'm better
02:34:24 than John Trun now and I'm like
02:34:26 you know what you're right I am
02:34:28 I am better than he is
02:34:30 and that's weird and cool
02:34:32 oh John
02:34:34 you bastard what happened
02:34:36 you're so beautiful
02:34:38 for a time
02:34:40 really Ethan
02:34:42 is like the new funny guy
02:34:44 I watch H3H3
02:34:46 I forgot to mention him
02:34:48 I uh
02:34:50 I watch all the H3H3
02:34:52 and Ethan and Ela videos but they're never like
02:34:54 great
02:34:56 you know it's usually just like
02:34:58 yeah alright that was pleasant
02:35:00 every once in a while you get one that's like
02:35:02 memorable but you know
02:35:04 I think the stuff he does in public
02:35:06 where he's being a weirdo is like
02:35:08 yeah
02:35:10 it's like
02:35:12 for the fact that the jokes aren't that great
02:35:14 it's just like the spectacle of him
02:35:16 making an ass of himself in public
02:35:18 is like whoa cool
02:35:20 yeah and he does it in a
02:35:22 not douche baggy way
02:35:24 whereas some I think a lot of those
02:35:26 people like you know
02:35:28 because he's it's funny because he's so
02:35:30 close to being the stuff he makes
02:35:32 fun of like the prank bros
02:35:34 and everything but it's just like the important
02:35:36 difference is that he's just not an ass
02:35:38 while doing it you know
02:35:40 those people are those people are like
02:35:42 damaging and
02:35:44 scary and why are they out
02:35:46 in public doing that whereas with Ethan
02:35:48 he's always the butt of the joke
02:35:50 yeah
02:35:52 I mean I think he was saying
02:35:54 you're done with filthy frank or someone
02:35:56 was done with filthy frank maybe Jesse
02:35:58 because he was doing all those things
02:36:00 both me and Jesse
02:36:02 like he was doing these things that are
02:36:04 just as bad as all the prank bro things
02:36:06 because he's just being a weirdo at people
02:36:08 and he's not making any attempt
02:36:10 to make it like charming it's just
02:36:12 as weird as possible
02:36:14 I'm like yeah that like when he's had
02:36:16 that ravioli in his pocket
02:36:18 I was that I forget what that was
02:36:20 I don't know it was weird
02:36:22 he's going around to people with it
02:36:24 yeah
02:36:26 well
02:36:28 like I have a lot of like the
02:36:30 reason I followed filthy frank for a long
02:36:32 time is just I have a lot of respect for
02:36:34 like the physical comedy
02:36:36 like when like I mean with Ethan
02:36:38 too that it's that he'll
02:36:40 like when he did the fucking boy band thing
02:36:42 and it's like he really changed
02:36:44 his whole fucking appearance just for this
02:36:46 video you know you know like shave
02:36:48 off his head and fucking spray paint
02:36:50 himself with tanning spray and just
02:36:52 become this monster for often
02:36:54 like days
02:36:56 or weeks on end you know
02:36:58 like going through this physical transformation
02:37:00 for the comedy and I really appreciate
02:37:02 that and like filthy frank will do
02:37:04 stuff like there's one video where he
02:37:06 like just like
02:37:08 falls out of a car door while it's
02:37:10 moving it just like
02:37:12 like rolls on the pavement
02:37:14 it was just like oh my god that looked
02:37:16 painful as shit
02:37:18 but I do think that filthy frank
02:37:20 stuff has gotten to the point where like
02:37:22 it's
02:37:24 it's just kind of crass and I mean I know
02:37:26 that's the point but it's
02:37:28 it's not quite tongue in cheek enough
02:37:30 for me to think that he's not just
02:37:32 being a dick you know
02:37:34 and he's not really being a funny
02:37:36 dick nest like there's way I think it
02:37:38 would be possible to just be a total
02:37:40 asshole and for that to also be hilarious
02:37:42 if it was so over the top
02:37:44 but it's not it's like he's afraid
02:37:46 of crossing that line and so he doesn't
02:37:48 quite become like a total dick
02:37:50 that would be funny to watch you know
02:37:52 voyeuristically
02:37:56 but uh
02:37:58 that's just what I thought of off the top
02:38:00 of my head
02:38:02 that could all be
02:38:04 totally unsubstantiated
02:38:06 and uh just
02:38:08 me wanting to not like filthy frank
02:38:10 I
02:38:12 hate the whole
02:38:14 circle jerk between Frank, John
02:38:16 Trott and Ethan I just
02:38:18 I'm not impressed by it and now
02:38:20 potentially donkey as well
02:38:22 yeah donkey seems to be like
02:38:24 on the fringes of it
02:38:26 just because it's I mean we
02:38:28 don't circle jerk a lot but
02:38:30 but all of our content
02:38:32 is good and we don't circle
02:38:34 jerk any like what bothers me about
02:38:36 it is that like they're all
02:38:38 putting each other in their main videos
02:38:40 just to have them there
02:38:42 yeah somewhere else like that it'll be
02:38:44 like they're watching a John Trott video
02:38:46 then suddenly Ethan's there and he's not there
02:38:48 to like serve I mean it was funny in the
02:38:50 Kool-Aid Man one but like
02:38:52 when they went to that like karate dojo
02:38:54 it was like why these two why is
02:38:56 this happening this is just
02:38:58 it's just for the sake of having them both on screen
02:39:00 in the same video you know
02:39:02 I don't think it enhanced
02:39:04 anything to have them both there which is like
02:39:06 all of us TPC members have been
02:39:08 since the pony days pretty strict
02:39:10 about not doing frivolous
02:39:12 collaborations it went
02:39:14 pretty poorly when me and you did it
02:39:16 yeah I was gonna say
02:39:18 we I tried
02:39:20 to make it it was weird as well because
02:39:22 we weren't even we
02:39:24 hadn't really talked even that much
02:39:26 right but I was I asked
02:39:28 you for a color I can't remember why we
02:39:30 did it but we did it
02:39:32 I came to you about it because
02:39:34 oh yeah that's why I didn't want to talk
02:39:36 like oh my god it's didgy
02:39:38 right it was just that I didn't want
02:39:40 to cover the episode myself because I
02:39:42 that was at the point in season
02:39:44 four where I was like doing weird shit
02:39:46 and I was busy with other stuff and I
02:39:48 was just like this episode fucking blows
02:39:50 and I don't want to talk about it so I'll just
02:39:52 jump in on somebody else's
02:39:54 video and I'll jump in on you because
02:39:56 you were one of the people I respected
02:39:58 so you know I always had this
02:40:00 mindset of like I wanted to collect
02:40:02 the people who I like the most
02:40:04 so like if I thought your videos
02:40:06 were great then I wanted some way to
02:40:08 associate us so that it would like you know
02:40:10 help you out in a way
02:40:12 so I was like yeah I'll be in a hippo
02:40:14 video and that'll draw more attention to
02:40:16 hippo and I don't have to make a video about
02:40:18 it and then it was we didn't
02:40:20 put a lot of effort into making it like
02:40:22 work it just kind of sucked
02:40:26 like particularly the the collaborative
02:40:28 bit of it was just like awkward and
02:40:30 terrible
02:40:32 probably my fault because I'm not funny
02:40:36 well I think we just didn't really try
02:40:38 on the script like you wrote what you
02:40:40 were going to say about the thing and then I wrote a sentence
02:40:42 and then that was it we didn't go over it
02:40:44 again
02:40:46 yeah I'm just really all I
02:40:48 wanted to do was I wanted to avoid
02:40:50 the the the classic
02:40:52 that guy with the glasses whoa
02:40:54 what are you doing here so
02:40:56 I just said oh you're here
02:40:58 and then we talked
02:41:00 but yeah it was it didn't make up for the
02:41:02 fact that we didn't really have anything to do with each other
02:41:04 in the video
02:41:06 right I really want us to do
02:41:08 more like the best
02:41:10 I think best guy ever is monster musume
02:41:12 is the best collaboration that we
02:41:14 have ever done as a group
02:41:16 like it was so because that's
02:41:18 the only way to like he integrated all
02:41:20 of us but it didn't matter that it was
02:41:22 us it just mattered that it was
02:41:24 some guy doing something
02:41:26 weird with a monster character
02:41:28 you know like
02:41:30 it could have been anybody really
02:41:32 so it wasn't about like oh hey
02:41:34 my friends are all in the video it was
02:41:36 like that was a bonus to the fact that it also
02:41:38 made sense in the context of the video
02:41:40 and that's what I want collabs to be
02:41:42 I don't I don't want to just put Jesse
02:41:44 in the video because he's Jesse it has to
02:41:46 be that he serves a function
02:41:48 you know
02:41:50 yeah
02:41:52 that was that one other
02:41:54 collab thing where you asked me and Jesse
02:41:56 just to do to do some like
02:41:58 yeah at the end of your video and that one went
02:42:00 well because it was
02:42:02 that it was the leap of faith
02:42:04 video
02:42:06 and it's like 15 minutes long and it's a part
02:42:08 basically the script was really
02:42:10 depressing and I was
02:42:12 worried that it was like too
02:42:14 depressing and edgy sounding
02:42:16 so I was like what if
02:42:18 I like drew attention to this fact
02:42:20 by having jokes in there but
02:42:22 the joke is that like I tell you guys
02:42:24 to lighten up the mood and you make nothing
02:42:26 but cancer jokes
02:42:28 in a video where I was talking
02:42:30 about my mom having had cancer
02:42:32 I think like I think I bring that up in
02:42:34 the video so it was like
02:42:36 you know
02:42:38 like no one could say oh you can't
02:42:40 cancer jokes because like I just talked about
02:42:42 like dealing with it like personally
02:42:44 so
02:42:46 the joke is I'm like give in tell a
02:42:48 joke and you're like
02:42:50 then you just like
02:42:52 I fucked up I didn't
02:42:54 do it
02:42:56 it was great
02:42:58 yeah
02:43:00 you should rewatch that
02:43:02 sometime just for the ending bit because
02:43:04 like both both of
02:43:06 you sent me like too much
02:43:08 but it was all good
02:43:10 so I put like a little bit of it
02:43:12 in the middle and then I like left in
02:43:14 all the other jokes you made at the end
02:43:16 and there's like two minutes of you just
02:43:18 like rambling
02:43:20 incoherently about clouds
02:43:22 having silver lining but then you get
02:43:24 like diseases from the silver
02:43:26 or something like that
02:43:28 it's classic
02:43:30 everyone should go look it up
02:43:32 you won't find it it's in a playlist somewhere
02:43:34 on my channel
02:43:36 on my channel
02:43:38 my little pony episode
02:43:40 yeah it's a good
02:43:42 I watched it recently and I laughed
02:43:44 a bunch
02:43:46 and then I died
02:43:48 I killed myself
02:43:52 so
02:43:54 how do you feel about the whole pony
02:43:56 era of videos
02:43:58 and about the show itself like in retrospect
02:44:02 well the way
02:44:04 I mean I like it the pony era
02:44:06 because it's how I started
02:44:08 getting into youtube and making
02:44:10 things frequently
02:44:12 and getting better and that's sort of what
02:44:14 allowed me to get the courage
02:44:16 to begin hypocrite really
02:44:18 was that I was making videos and people liked them
02:44:20 and I was like whoa I could really
02:44:22 do what I really want of video games
02:44:24 um as for the
02:44:26 show though I don't know
02:44:28 I liked a few
02:44:30 episodes it was the most recent
02:44:32 season six is it six now
02:44:34 yeah
02:44:36 yeah I watched a few of those
02:44:38 the first three were terrible
02:44:40 and after that it's pretty great
02:44:42 so I think I still like the show
02:44:44 I'm just not too invested in
02:44:46 anything to do with the fandom at all
02:44:48 right
02:44:50 I think we all kind of concluded that we
02:44:52 didn't want to be involved with the fandom
02:44:54 yeah I mean really
02:44:56 there isn't much to the fandom anymore
02:44:58 it's just you know all the musicians
02:45:00 I just sort of
02:45:02 tired of it all the artists
02:45:04 I just sort of doing the same thing
02:45:06 and the analysis crew is
02:45:08 they're all just in it for the money
02:45:10 and the analysis people
02:45:12 are fucking cancer so
02:45:14 they are awful you had
02:45:16 a lot of experience with those people
02:45:18 like you were in that chat for a lot longer
02:45:20 and you talked to them for longer
02:45:22 the bro analysis
02:45:24 Skype chat
02:45:26 where I think
02:45:28 were you even invited to that
02:45:30 yeah I was there at first
02:45:32 and I left after like a month or so
02:45:34 yeah
02:45:36 it's weird because at the top I think Skype
02:45:38 usually says who used to be in the thing
02:45:40 and who's left or maybe no
02:45:42 maybe it's just the people who just never
02:45:44 talked yeah because I saw
02:45:46 Tommy Oliver was in there but he never said anything
02:45:50 but all those people in there
02:45:52 I don't really
02:45:54 want to get into it because it's sort of
02:45:56 wrong a lot of stuff to say
02:45:58 but just they suck
02:46:00 most of them suck
02:46:02 I'm glad to have left it
02:46:04 there's a good reason that none of us
02:46:06 are going to BronyCon again
02:46:08 because uh
02:46:10 I mean I don't know I like the con kind of
02:46:12 but it is weird I would rather
02:46:14 go to a different con
02:46:16 if I could
02:46:18 but instead you're going to a
02:46:20 conference
02:46:22 in Virginia Beach Virginia
02:46:24 I almost said my address
02:46:26 for some reason
02:46:28 yeah don't do that
02:46:30 I almost went through my entire address
02:46:32 and I was like wait a minute
02:46:34 why am I doing that
02:46:36 not that my address is probably hard to find
02:46:38 or anything
02:46:40 I do want to open a PO box soon
02:46:42 so have you thought about
02:46:44 expanding and doing videos
02:46:46 about anything other than video games
02:46:48 um
02:46:50 perhaps
02:46:52 I was thinking maybe
02:46:54 I could try an analysis of an anime
02:46:56 just so that you know
02:46:58 because you always want one from people
02:47:00 you want more anime analysis
02:47:02 and I guess I could analyze
02:47:04 one piece anime but I don't know
02:47:06 I don't know
02:47:08 there's nothing
02:47:10 well yeah after Nate's done his
02:47:12 but then you'd probably say everything
02:47:14 I
02:47:16 I could analyze movies really
02:47:18 I just want to talk about stuff I like
02:47:20 so if it just happens to be something that isn't a video game
02:47:22 then I'll talk about it anyway
02:47:24 it's a very nostalgia based channel
02:47:26 I mean that's like
02:47:28 theoretically
02:47:30 my channel has never been
02:47:32 an anime channel
02:47:34 it's just that I only talk about anime
02:47:36 like it's
02:47:38 it's never been like
02:47:40 this is just the only thing I care about
02:47:42 because I've done like a couple
02:47:44 video game videos in there and like a couple
02:47:46 film analysis but it's like
02:47:48 I don't care about anything other
02:47:50 than anime so
02:47:52 it's clear that your fans like
02:47:54 they know
02:47:56 that you're smart enough to talk about things
02:47:58 like Dark Souls because everybody loved that video
02:48:00 well that video
02:48:02 I think that video hit it big
02:48:04 outside of my main audience
02:48:06 because it has a
02:48:08 fuckload of comments and most of them are from people I don't recognize
02:48:10 so I really think
02:48:12 it just got big in like the gaming circle
02:48:14 and the Bloodborne fandom
02:48:16 or Dark Souls fandom like as opposed to
02:48:18 my main audience for the most part
02:48:20 I guess
02:48:22 but uh
02:48:24 yeah I'm definitely seen as an anime
02:48:26 YouTuber I mean which is completely fair
02:48:28 it's all I cover but like I it's never
02:48:30 been technically an anime channel
02:48:32 um
02:48:34 but Hippocrite so far
02:48:36 has been exclusively video games
02:48:38 and I guess skeletons
02:48:40 yeah
02:48:44 what is it with you and skeletons
02:48:46 what's the deal with that
02:48:48 oh finish what I'm going to say first
02:48:50 I forgot what I was going to say
02:48:52 and now I want to talk about skeletons
02:48:54 skeletons are cool
02:48:56 because
02:48:58 they don't need to say any words
02:49:00 they just swing their sword I think I mentioned
02:49:02 I actually didn't really go into much depth
02:49:04 in the skeletons video
02:49:06 but I love skeletons because of the
02:49:08 cauldron skeletons which are really creepy
02:49:10 and spooky and cool and dangerous
02:49:12 and
02:49:14 the skeletons from Dark Cloud
02:49:16 because I don't know I love Dark Cloud
02:49:18 and skeletons in that
02:49:20 I think there's just something about
02:49:22 the way a skull it looks
02:49:24 like a face because it's obviously a human
02:49:26 skull
02:49:28 but it's like it's got this innate
02:49:30 spooky quality
02:49:32 because the eyes are black
02:49:34 and if you know anything about you know
02:49:36 shitty deviant art
02:49:38 creepypasta stuff everybody always makes
02:49:40 the eyes black to make it scary
02:49:42 if you got like a cursed Mario game
02:49:44 that's why everybody's afraid of black people
02:49:46 yeah well
02:49:48 badum tish
02:49:50 badum shh
02:49:52 that's why people are scared of you because you wear
02:49:54 black glasses
02:49:56 sunglasses
02:49:58 but yeah I don't know
02:50:00 I could go into the analysis
02:50:02 of why a skeleton is
02:50:04 a symbol of death
02:50:06 and death is really cool
02:50:08 I don't know
02:50:10 I don't know why I like skeletons
02:50:12 I think I like the fact that
02:50:14 they're a symbol of death but they can be really goofy
02:50:16 because they can't talk
02:50:18 and they're just like uh
02:50:20 fall apart
02:50:22 yeah
02:50:24 I guess it's like
02:50:26 there's something moe about skeletons
02:50:28 in that like they simultaneously
02:50:30 are imposing but also very fragile
02:50:32 yeah I actually had this idea
02:50:34 it was really weird
02:50:36 and it would
02:50:38 I don't know whether it ever
02:50:40 exist
02:50:42 in any form but there's
02:50:44 idea for an anime where the main girl
02:50:46 main girl character
02:50:48 gets turned into a skeleton
02:50:50 and it's like oh no my chest
02:50:52 is flatter than that other girl now
02:50:54 or something
02:50:56 which would be one of the things
02:50:58 but the main thing is obviously trying to fit in
02:51:00 because she doesn't have any skin
02:51:02 so she's got to wear clothing all over herself
02:51:04 and people are like what's wrong
02:51:06 why don't you show me your face
02:51:08 why don't you speak
02:51:10 I don't have a voice box anymore
02:51:12 and she has to learn sign language
02:51:14 and she becomes
02:51:16 friends with the death kid
02:51:18 that nobody likes
02:51:20 this would make an amazing one shot
02:51:22 you really need to make a one shot out
02:51:24 it's like 45 pages
02:51:26 it's just the idea of having
02:51:28 like a cute girl but she's a skeleton
02:51:30 and that's
02:51:32 I don't think that's been done before
02:51:34 I could totally see that working
02:51:36 it being
02:51:38 like a weird
02:51:40 offbeat magazine in Japan
02:51:44 because it, frank and fran
02:51:46 you might like the manga frank and fran
02:51:48 I just bought the first two
02:51:50 omnibus volumes of it today but it's a
02:51:52 it's sort of
02:51:54 that combination of like
02:51:56 like cuteness
02:51:58 but mostly gruesomeness
02:52:00 it's like a
02:52:02 it's about a girl named fran who
02:52:04 was like
02:52:06 she's basically a frank and sign monster person
02:52:08 but she's also like a doctor
02:52:10 and she lives out in this mansion in the middle of nowhere
02:52:12 and like she'll repair people
02:52:14 but she always turns them
02:52:16 into like some kind of Kafka-esque nightmare
02:52:18 so like
02:52:20 someone will come in and they'll be like I broke my leg
02:52:22 and she's like I can fix it
02:52:24 I have to mutate it with this other
02:52:26 animal and then like
02:52:28 she'll turn them into some kind of freakish monster
02:52:30 and like it'll alter their personality in some way
02:52:32 and it's fucking great
02:52:34 I think you might enjoy it
02:52:36 and fran is adorable
02:52:38 so uh
02:52:40 there's lots of cute girls
02:52:42 I've just realized one thing about skeletons
02:52:44 which is the reason I don't like some skeletons
02:52:46 is that they can't have an expression
02:52:48 like if a skeleton were
02:52:50 to just be a guy and you call him over
02:52:52 and he turns around he'd just have that completely
02:52:54 blank face because he doesn't have any face
02:52:56 muscles and he'd just be looking at you
02:52:58 you couldn't tell what he was thinking
02:53:00 like when the people
02:53:02 have skeletons and they give them angry skeleton
02:53:04 eye holes it's like
02:53:06 silly
02:53:08 the way you would do it with the anime or
02:53:10 manga version is that you use
02:53:12 just all those like manga
02:53:14 like blush and stuff
02:53:16 yeah somehow
02:53:18 sweat drops and stuff like that
02:53:20 yeah
02:53:22 cause they're usually like drawn over the face
02:53:24 more so than on it anyways
02:53:26 so I think it would work
02:53:28 I think it's a great idea
02:53:30 I want to read it back like I have a picture in my head
02:53:32 of what it would look like and it seems really good
02:53:34 and I really want to read it
02:53:38 and I could totally see it
02:53:40 being a chapter of Frank and Fran
02:53:42 hilariously enough
02:53:44 oh shit
02:53:46 David Boney I'm afraid of a skeletons
02:53:48 one of my
02:53:50 one of my favorite music videos on the internet
02:53:52 on the Hippocrite channel
02:53:54 which I heard
02:53:56 that long before I actually
02:53:58 tried to find the actual song
02:54:00 and I don't like the actual song
02:54:02 nearly as much
02:54:04 cause the version you used is like this
02:54:06 it was like a weird karaoke version
02:54:08 you found I guess
02:54:10 and I just kinda like the instrumental
02:54:12 in that better than the actual song
02:54:14 and you mumbling about
02:54:16 skeletons over it
02:54:18 it's really funny
02:54:20 it's the best
02:54:22 I'm afraid of skeletons
02:54:26 I'm afraid of the world
02:54:28 yeah I'm proud of that
02:54:30 the way I
02:54:32 filmed that was I got
02:54:34 my dad has these
02:54:36 rotating like
02:54:38 colored lights that he uses
02:54:40 for like a stage performances
02:54:42 and stuff
02:54:44 and they were just in the
02:54:46 the room so I was like
02:54:48 let's plug them in and get all the halloween
02:54:50 decorations and just go nuts
02:54:52 and it was me and both of my brothers
02:54:54 were just having a fucking
02:54:56 blast being idiots
02:54:58 and yeah
02:55:00 I asked Henry to film
02:55:02 me singing and then I filmed
02:55:04 them doing everything else
02:55:06 and I just filmed it over and over until I had
02:55:08 a bunch of weird shots and then it put it together
02:55:10 and it worked
02:55:12 it's great
02:55:14 it's definitely one of the most fun
02:55:16 things that has ever happened
02:55:18 like it's just pure enjoyment
02:55:20 every time I watch it I'm like
02:55:22 yeah this is great
02:55:24 um
02:55:26 we're actually gonna be part of the
02:55:28 the 20 skeletons video
02:55:30 but I made it a separate thing
02:55:32 cause I felt like people would wanna rewatch
02:55:34 the cool music video and not have to go through
02:55:36 all the bullshit so
02:55:38 yeah I'm glad you made that decision cause I have watched it a bunch of times
02:55:40 so we're
02:55:42 getting towards the end here
02:55:44 do you have anything you really wanted to say
02:55:46 on this podcast that you haven't had a chance to
02:55:48 uh
02:55:50 not really
02:55:52 I mean I
02:55:54 probably will remember something like
02:55:56 two hours from now like fuck
02:55:58 but right now I can't think much
02:56:00 else that I wanna say I think I've talked
02:56:02 about myself
02:56:04 I talked about what I like and what I do
02:56:06 uh
02:56:08 go subscribe to Hippocrite
02:56:10 YouTube
02:56:12 and it's spelt like Hippo as in
02:56:14 Hippopotamus and Crit as in Critic
02:56:16 there will be a link in the description
02:56:18 I know but
02:56:20 I know but Google still
02:56:22 changes it to Hippocrite
02:56:24 and it's wrong
02:56:26 Hippocrite is the real world
02:56:28 and I don't like it
02:56:30 I invented Hippocrite
02:56:32 it's mine
