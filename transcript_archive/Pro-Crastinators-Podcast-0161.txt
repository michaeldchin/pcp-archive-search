00:00:00 What's up today guys? I'm not going to prolong this endeavor anymore because I'm trapped in
00:00:15 my father's wine cellar and listen it smells like wine down here which you would think would
00:00:20 be nice but after about 10 years it starts getting a little bit freaky. So I'm calling
00:00:26 for help. Is that Hippocrit on the other line? Hello, what is the nature of your emergency
00:00:33 or whatever? I'm trapped inside a wine cellar but I can record one more podcast before my
00:00:38 father comes in with a belt. What podcast should we record? Let's record a PCP. Okay, great.
00:00:44 Alright, we're going to pick people like a football coach in high school. I picked Tom
00:00:50 to be on the PCP. Oh fuck, I'm here on the final episode of the PCP. I'm so fucking stoked
00:00:56 to watch Munchy get destroyed. No, I picked Mage for the PCP. As tradition I get picked
00:01:06 last. Oh, it's true. It's funny because it's true. It's apt though. It's totally apt. Hey
00:01:14 by the way guys, wait, hold on. Head count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5 equals none. Wait a second,
00:01:22 guys. Ground quick and beat with our feet. Open up, fall into a chasm. A chasm full of
00:01:27 beauty. There's no, or been here. There's no need or been here. Oh, you know what that
00:01:32 means? You know what that means? Tom, what does that mean? Tom, what does that mean?
00:01:35 Tom, what does that mean? It means there's going to be no bullshit politics on this episode
00:01:39 of the PCP. It's literally impossible. Guys, I'm going to be real with you right now. Every
00:01:49 single day we record the PCP, I think myself, what topics can I bring up? There are like
00:01:54 one or two or three topics I think to bring up and I think myself, nah, the PCP sucks.
00:02:01 It's going to be political shit. I'm going to save this for RFCK. But there's no chance
00:02:05 of that. This PCP has no chance of being bad. I'm breaking it out. I'm breaking out the
00:02:10 good topics.
00:02:11 Oh, okay, okay.
00:02:12 All right, all right. Finally, a good discussion.
00:02:13 I have one thing to say before you get into the good topics though. As of you listening
00:02:18 to this audience member, Balejap Finale is out and is on the APSAdventures.site. Go watch
00:02:25 it, go read it. Balejap is done. I did it. It's not out for the members of the PCP to
00:02:31 watch and listen to and react to right now. Unfortunately, I was hoping to get it done
00:02:35 by now. But you will be able to see it. So links on the screen and in the description
00:02:43 to my thing, my big thing.
00:02:47 Yeah, his big dick that is whipping around on the internet.
00:02:50 Yeah, okay, hippo. That's like really cool though. You know, you're like, oh, jail, paper,
00:02:55 automation.
00:02:56 Can we please talk about the thing that was released on my channel that is not viewable
00:03:01 by the PCP members, but will be the time that the viewers are listening. And that's the
00:03:05 first episode of the Teen CP. Yes, that's right. The Teen CP. It's actually happened.
00:03:10 It was a nine man podcast that was recorded. It will be released on my channel. And truly,
00:03:17 it was sublime. If you lie, if you were a fan of the Charismat character that is the
00:03:20 Teen CP from these voicemail series, then you will just fucking just quiver and quake
00:03:27 and your asshole will break by the time you listen to that fucking podcast. So look forward
00:03:32 to that. And I look forward to that. I mean, look forward in the past backwards because
00:03:36 you can click on the link in the description right now. Go click on jail, babe. And like,
00:03:40 you know, cry because it's, you know, jail, babe. And then click on the Teen CP and cry
00:03:45 because it's on the heart of the Teen CP. You keep saying jail, babe. It's bail, jaype.
00:03:50 It's a jaype. I say, I say jail, babe, every single fucking time, literally like in text
00:03:56 and in conversation. Is it like a mistake? Is it a mistake or is it just like, oh, well,
00:04:01 you know, no. I'm on every man. Okay, guys, here's what's happening right now. As Tom
00:04:12 said before the podcast, but you guys didn't hear because you don't have long enough ears.
00:04:16 I am in Boston, Massachusetts right now. Boston, Massachusetts. Do do knock on wood. There
00:04:23 I did it. What was supposed to happen? Don't know. Anyway, I'm here right now. And I'm
00:04:29 in the vicinity of Tom in like a 25 square meter. So we're going to meet the hell up.
00:04:34 And I've already meeting up with Ben. Tom wasn't there because he's in a wheelchair.
00:04:39 He's wheelchair bound. We're going to get like an actual wheelchair for you and then
00:04:43 push you around the time. It's going to happen. Dude, I can't wait. I'll just be the brand
00:04:47 of the PCP. I'll do nothing, but I'll be king by the end. It's going to happen yesterday.
00:04:52 Like a week ago, by the time the viewers are hearing this, I was with Ben and Kazi and
00:04:56 every time we like saw someone that was incapacitated in any way, like they were stumbling or like
00:05:00 they were in a wheelchair. We cropped to the ground laughing up fucking awesome.
00:05:03 As you should. No. Well, no, we pointed and said that's Tom and then dropped the four
00:05:09 lines. But there's so many. This trip to Boston is a truly sentimental one because this is
00:05:21 the last time I will ever be in this city as a tourist. This is the last time I will
00:05:30 ever not live here. I don't know if I said this on the PCP. I'm sure I did, but I probably
00:05:37 just got in and got right out and then like, you know, I went to the building, planted the
00:05:40 bomb and then just ran away as fast as I could, you know, as you do. But yeah, I'm in college,
00:05:46 fully enrolled, fully put down everything that I need to, not even like a maybe like,
00:05:51 you know, like, oh, you know, probably going to happen. Like, no, really going to happen.
00:05:55 So you got accepted.
00:05:56 A guy, dude, I got accepted. I put down my down payment. I have my room. I have my room
00:06:01 assignments. I have fucking everything.
00:06:02 That's fucking legendary, dude. Congrats.
00:06:05 I know what it what is. Oh, I guess, September is probably when you start.
00:06:08 Of course. So I'm here for another week and then I'm going to be leaving. And then the next
00:06:14 time I set foot in these fair aisles, I shall be a resident. I shall be a legal resident.
00:06:22 Do you know what you should definitely do is at college in your class, you should get as many
00:06:27 people to join RFCK as possible.
00:06:31 Oh, dude. Okay.
00:06:32 And then and then like when you do like a live RFCK, RFCK, like, calm, you'll have like a
00:06:39 hundred thousands of people will be already in Boston to do it.
00:06:44 Oh, okay, no doubt.
00:06:45 There are going. Oh, no, God.
00:06:50 Oh, no, we were off to such a good.
00:06:53 All right, guys, you don't pack it at the good topics are coming back into the bag.
00:06:56 Sorry, guys, I'm going to have to leave now.
00:06:59 No, no.
00:07:01 Oh, he's he's he's he's deaf in himself.
00:07:03 Ben St. Ben St. came into the call.
00:07:05 And by the way, I believe in Paul, please play the sound that plays when you meet
00:07:09 and or if not, every no time, but anyway, just to finish that, I don't even know what the
00:07:19 fuck I was talking about.
00:07:20 But in college schemes, schemes to get people on to play in this war in college.
00:07:24 I really thought about it.
00:07:25 I am going to it basically completely shift my life around in a pretty major way and sort
00:07:32 of like fully dedicate myself to college or at least at the very least, that's the plan
00:07:38 currently. Of course.
00:07:39 And yeah, and I am going to go as hog while that's possibly came doing curricular and
00:07:46 extracurricular activities and try and do clubs and all that sort of stuff like that.
00:07:49 Get the most bang for my buck.
00:07:52 And part of that, I assume there will be some sort of, you know, video game development club.
00:07:58 If there's not, I'll literally just make one of my own because, you know, fucking are you joking
00:08:01 me? Fucking art college is not going to be able to make video games.
00:08:04 Yeah, yeah. Disgusting, unacceptable.
00:08:07 Yes, fucking moron.
00:08:09 Ben was talking here, but wasn't recording his audio yet because he's a moron.
00:08:14 But that's usually because my microphone sucks.
00:08:17 And also I hate you.
00:08:25 There he goes.
00:08:27 Just just kick him.
00:08:28 Somebody kick him.
00:08:29 Just get him out of here.
00:08:30 But by the way, I really hope that he wasn't recording thinking that we hadn't started
00:08:33 the show yet. And now, now no one will be able to understand why we laughed.
00:08:36 I really hope that was the case.
00:08:37 By the way, audience, um, love you.
00:08:39 Okay.
00:08:41 Anyway, back to what we were saying, uh, I am going to shill endless war so, so, so fucking
00:08:47 hard in whatever game development or even just to anyone that I fucking know, I'll
00:08:52 swear an endless war t-shirt that has a link to the discord on it.
00:08:55 But rest assured, I'm going to be shilling.
00:08:57 You're going to be the most powerful person in college because everyone else is going
00:09:00 to be like, uh, yeah.
00:09:01 I just came from my parent's house.
00:09:02 I'm ready to, to learn the ways of like anatomy and drawing and stuff.
00:09:06 And you'd be like, I'm already a seasoned game designer.
00:09:08 I have a video game.
00:09:09 I have a huge audience.
00:09:10 I make tons of money.
00:09:11 Yeah.
00:09:12 I'm like teaching you guys.
00:09:13 I'm teaching the classes now.
00:09:15 Dude.
00:09:16 Okay.
00:09:17 There is.
00:09:18 Okay.
00:09:19 When you got accepted to college, they, there was an email sent to you saying directing
00:09:22 you to the Facebook group of the college being like, Hey, come on and mingle with some
00:09:27 of the new bingles.
00:09:28 And then I thought, well, I'm a bingle.
00:09:30 Might as well mingle.
00:09:31 And then I mosey dawned over and then I pose on Beauvard.
00:09:34 And I got into the, uh, Facebook and it was really uncomfortable and strange to actually
00:09:40 post on, on Facebook.
00:09:42 Brush assured the other zoomers there thought so as well.
00:09:44 And so they made a discord group and I entered a discord, a discord group for all of the
00:09:48 freshmen that are attending and also know what discord is, I guess.
00:09:52 And it was a really interesting experience to be able to, you know, like, like, like actually
00:09:57 like have like prolonged conversations with people from the school.
00:10:01 Cause obviously I'm no stranger to the school.
00:10:03 I've been there on multiple occasions, been all over the campus.
00:10:06 No, no, a lot about it.
00:10:08 And been to one or two social functions in there, you know, not major things, but I've
00:10:13 been to some, uh, some fucking hangout sessions with some of the people there.
00:10:17 And, uh, they were nice.
00:10:19 And one of the reasons I wanted to attend was that I thought that I could gel well with
00:10:24 the people there.
00:10:25 But I had not had, you know, prolonged conversations in a, in a, in a, in a discord like chat experience.
00:10:33 And so I was able to, the first time after receiving that blink, click that link, I said
00:10:39 to myself and then did so.
00:10:41 Uh, and entering the chat was, I think my first experience would be it was, was something
00:10:48 to the effect of like, wow, I like these people will be so fun to lead.
00:10:54 You know, like it was like, it was like walking into like a orphanage, thinking myself like,
00:11:01 wow, I'll be like the best like executor of commands that anyone could possibly be ever
00:11:08 where it's like, they were all nice people, but you could tell they were all a little
00:11:12 bit insecure.
00:11:13 So I know that I'm going to be able to use that to my advantage and get them to do like,
00:11:17 not like, you know, like evil things for me, but we're going to be able to like make like
00:11:20 cities.
00:11:21 Like we shall make like, in Minecraft.
00:11:24 Yeah.
00:11:25 In Minecraft.
00:11:26 We're going to be able to fucking achieve any goals with me at their helm.
00:11:30 Me as their benevolent dictator overlord.
00:11:32 I will be able to lead the, uh, are you going to go in like, like first day in the pizza
00:11:37 jumpsuit?
00:11:38 Yeah.
00:11:39 Why not?
00:11:40 I think that's, that's, that's a good way to establish dominance.
00:11:42 You know?
00:11:43 Oh, for sure.
00:11:44 Dude, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to wear the pizza jumpsuit because fucking, you know,
00:11:48 Yeah.
00:11:49 YOLO, bro.
00:11:50 YOLO.
00:11:51 It's, I, I, in, in the, in the initial Facebook group, there was, it was customary to make
00:11:58 a post like saying like, Hey guys, it's me, you know, check out me, Teehee.
00:12:02 And then I did so as well.
00:12:04 And all the photos that I sent to word, they were all from anime expo.
00:12:09 And there was me and my pizza, uh, my pizza onesie nearly next to a, uh, power box that
00:12:14 had picture of an aunt on it doing a peace sign.
00:12:16 Then it was me with Digi and Nate doing the Neko Neko, uh, like, like anime pause with
00:12:21 all the cat girl maids and those were the images.
00:12:24 I saw that image recently.
00:12:25 The one closest to you looks very disturbed.
00:12:29 Uh, that's going to be the entirety of my college.
00:12:33 How long do you think it's going to be for somebody who's going to be like, Oh my God,
00:12:36 Monchi, you know Digi, bro.
00:12:38 Um, I think it's due.
00:12:40 Uh, my Kazi goes to the school I'm going to and she by proxy already gets people to
00:12:47 be in like, you know, someone who knows Digi bro.
00:12:50 So, uh, it's going to be.
00:12:52 She's like, yeah, I know myself, you fucking idiot.
00:12:55 I've met Digi bro.
00:12:56 Oh yeah.
00:12:57 I forgot about that.
00:12:58 Worlds, worlds colliding.
00:13:00 Did you, were you recording last time?
00:13:04 Of course not.
00:13:05 Of course not.
00:13:06 Of course not.
00:13:07 You know what Ben?
00:13:12 You know what Ben?
00:13:14 Fuck you.
00:13:15 No, no, no.
00:13:16 Don't you start up this here.
00:13:18 No.
00:13:19 Then I have the power to kick you.
00:13:24 Oh, she does.
00:13:26 She's the she's the dude.
00:13:27 Do that and look like the biggest piece of shit.
00:13:30 Go right ahead.
00:13:31 I could.
00:13:32 I know.
00:13:33 I could.
00:13:34 I could.
00:13:35 Damn, please.
00:13:36 Above us all.
00:13:37 What are we taught?
00:13:38 What are we talking about?
00:13:39 What are we?
00:13:40 What have I missed so far?
00:13:41 We're talking about college.
00:13:42 We're talking.
00:13:43 We're talking about.
00:13:44 We're talking about how it's been.
00:13:45 You and Ben aren't here.
00:13:46 So now we are free to do as we please.
00:13:48 Me and Nate, you know, just confuse me and Nate.
00:13:50 No, you said you and Ben.
00:13:52 You said you and Ben, yeah, obliterated.
00:13:54 Same for Tex and logic.
00:13:56 Um college sucks.
00:13:58 Yeah.
00:13:59 Yeah, we know.
00:14:00 Yeah, yeah, we know. But, right, new topic, video games.
00:14:06 Video games suck.
00:14:08 This is a video game-related topic. I've been working tirelessly, like, for weeks, for months on Balejape.
00:14:16 I am, like, so close, as in, like, it will be out by the time you're... I mean, I already said that already.
00:14:22 And I've got, like, a few panels left, and it will probably be out by the end of today, even.
00:14:28 But I have been so fucking... I want to play a video game so hard.
00:14:36 Every day, I'm, like, I'm looking at my DS, even. I'm looking at my 3DS. I'm looking at my consoles.
00:14:42 I even bought a Nintendo 64 on a whim, just so I could have another game console.
00:14:48 I could look at it and be like, hey, that's old.
00:14:50 So you can be, like, one of those video game review men on YouTube with a wall of consoles.
00:14:56 Yeah, I could, I could, like, be like that.
00:14:58 And I look at my video games on the shelf and I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
00:15:02 It hurts so much not being able, like, not even Minecraft, not even, like, anything. I've just been working.
00:15:12 I've gone insane.
00:15:14 That's good. That's good work.
00:15:16 But I want to say that during my time animating and drawing for so long, playing games is a good escape.
00:15:24 You can't, you can't just give up sleep because you'll just burn yourself out. That's stupid.
00:15:30 You can't give up entertainment entirely.
00:15:32 No.
00:15:33 So I have sort of quit, like, failed the YouTube challenge that I started in the beginning of the year.
00:15:39 Where now I am, like, on my off-screen, off-monitor, watching videos basically all the time because I'm always basically drawing.
00:15:50 So it's like, I failed, you know, it sucks. I got, like, about three months into that.
00:15:57 And then I just sort of gave up because it was, yeah.
00:16:01 I mean, if you're just, if you're just listening to them off-tab while you're working, does that really count?
00:16:05 Well, it definitely still counts.
00:16:08 It definitely still counts. It's just sort of like, it was, it was easier for me to, to rationalize it when I was animating because so much of that is, like,
00:16:20 you can just sort of, like, tune out the, the thing. It just needs some sort of sound.
00:16:25 Wait.
00:16:26 I listened to music for a while.
00:16:27 But wasn't the whole point of doing it in the first place to prevent you from procrastinating and not doing, like, productive things with your time?
00:16:33 It, that was the point. And, and, and that's why I sort of was okay with quitting it. I might pick it up again later.
00:16:40 Well, that's what I was going to say. Is it's not necessarily bad if you actually are working while you're doing it.
00:16:46 The trap for me is that I'll say, I'll start watching a video and work while I have it on. And then that's not what happens.
00:16:55 Yeah, but that's the thing. So sometimes it does, it does distract me. And I've noticed this and I'm like, yeah, this is, this is,
00:17:02 it's not as bad as it used to be, but it's still distracting. It's still here. And I'm still letting myself be distracted on occasion.
00:17:09 Are you distracted in like, you just start listening to the audio and not doing the work, or do you just tab over and start watching the video?
00:17:16 Well, I've been watching a lot of like T90, like streams of Age of Empires 2 competitive scene stuff.
00:17:23 So like, every so often, he goes, oh my God, the quick wall or whatever he says, like the terminology.
00:17:30 And I'm like, whoa, I want to see that thing. And I click over and look at it. You'd be like, yeah, yeah, that was, that was very exciting.
00:17:37 And then I go back to work. But like, um...
00:17:40 Is this video game lust different than normal?
00:17:44 Different than normal lust?
00:17:49 I don't know what it is. I think, I think I'm just in like a nostalgic feeling.
00:17:53 Like a lot of things are just reminding me of like, oh yeah, I want to play that game.
00:17:58 I think it's because like during Hippocrite, every time I was thinking, oh, I should play that game from my childhood,
00:18:07 for the reason of like making a video about it and you know, getting views and subscribers and money and stuff.
00:18:13 And so the prospect of playing a game would be to sit down, play it properly, take notes, do all the, you know, record the footage.
00:18:22 It will be a big hassle. And I did that for a while and I ended up like not caring about video games by the end of like when I stopped doing the Hippocrite stuff.
00:18:31 But now that I, that's never like, is not a thing anymore. I just, I can feel the lust of gaming again.
00:18:39 I think that's what it is.
00:18:41 You know, that kind of rolls into something that I've experienced the last couple of days because I've been playing nothing but like Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne.
00:18:50 I've been marathoning all of them back to back, put like 200, 300 hours into those games over the past couple of weeks.
00:18:57 And just yesterday, I think it came in, I ordered the Analog Mega SG, which is like a HD version of a Sega Genesis.
00:19:08 They like remade it. So it's not emulation. It's like real hardware that like re-engineered all the hardware and made it so it outputs to 1080p so it can work with HD TVs and like not be shit.
00:19:18 So I got that because I wanted to start playing Sega again because I'm making a Sega game essentially.
00:19:23 Exactly.
00:19:25 That's the one.
00:19:26 That's the very same.
00:19:27 That's the one. The only Sega. The only one that ever existed. The rest don't, aren't real.
00:19:31 So I wanted to get into those games again to kind of like get me inspired and like be like okay this is how these games kind of work.
00:19:37 This is what the visuals look like. This is like some gameplay mechanics I could learn from.
00:19:40 And it was interesting because I played like Bloodborne especially because that's my favorite one I've played so far.
00:19:45 And I just did nothing else. Like I just got up, played Bloodborne, went to bed and like for like a week. It was bad.
00:19:52 But with Sega games they're like so much simpler that like I'll just play them for like a half an hour.
00:19:56 I'm like I'm good because like they're not immersive and like soul consuming.
00:20:00 They're just like simple little games that like you can't get sucked into.
00:20:04 And it's interesting that way. So I'm like playing Sega. I'll just play it for like 20 minutes.
00:20:09 I'm like I'm good. I got my inspiration. I can go back and do work now.
00:20:13 Back in the day the games were built around the idea of you die a lot and therefore in order to see more you can pay money in the arcade and stuff.
00:20:24 And so they brought that to home consoles with that design philosophy.
00:20:29 But now a lot of it is how can we keep you staying here and you know just repeating the same tasks every day over and over again.
00:20:36 With like daily quests and mobile games or that sort of keeps you coming back rather than putting a quarter in the thing.
00:20:43 I want to quickly say. Do you guys like this whole topic reminded me of back when I had my very first Xbox.
00:20:51 Like I only had one Xbox but it was like the first Xbox.
00:20:55 And on one of the games it had like previews of other games and you could play them for free the demos.
00:21:01 And it was kind of like such a weird thing because it was only like that was the only time I actually had like a game that had other games on it.
00:21:09 That you can sort of play a little bit as demos that that's like was that a thing.
00:21:13 Was that like a thing. I think there were like demos like demos on console like on your console.
00:21:20 Oh like some some early Xbox games did do that.
00:21:24 Like there you buy a lot of first party Microsoft titles.
00:21:28 I think that they have options to play like demos of other games they had published because they were trying to get people into like the Xbox ecosystem.
00:21:36 I don't think PlayStation really did that much.
00:21:38 PlayStation had the official PlayStation magazine and every month that came with a demo disk.
00:21:42 So that's just like kind of a big game.
00:21:44 Is that PMX 2 or PSM 2 or whatever it was called.
00:21:48 Oh god.
00:21:49 PMS 2 bigger, faster, bloodier.
00:21:54 The reckoning.
00:21:56 I know in America it was OPM the official PlayStation magazine.
00:22:01 OPM you know they're addictive.
00:22:03 Yeah it was very addictive because that's where I first played Shinobi my favorite PS2 game.
00:22:08 I think that I'm broken.
00:22:11 For some reason I don't even think it's tied to like productivity or you know maturing or anything to that effect.
00:22:20 But I've just lost all will to play video games and it makes me feel kind of weird because it's not as though I don't want to play video games in the sense that I don't like them.
00:22:33 It's just that I have no like.
00:22:35 You're broken get a factor of reset.
00:22:37 You should try to enter the gungeon if you like nuclear thrown.
00:22:40 No that's not it.
00:22:42 Well I'm just saying that I'm saying that because I feel that way sometimes but then other times I will like.
00:22:48 Yeah everyone I'll stumble across a game and that'll engage me for a while and I'll play a lot of it.
00:22:52 So I'm just saying like you know I think you and I have kind of similar taste in some games.
00:22:58 We do.
00:22:59 So like that's.
00:23:00 Sometimes.
00:23:01 Yeah.
00:23:02 I mean I know I feel like this is this is something that I mean has happened to me probably will happen to you.
00:23:10 You're going through it right now is where like you used to like you know have so much free time as a younger person.
00:23:16 You can play a game for an entire day.
00:23:19 I used to play World of Warcraft a lot during the summer.
00:23:22 Just all the time and I would get so much XPs.
00:23:28 What a true unembarrassment of XPs.
00:23:31 Yeah.
00:23:32 But like after you know after I started having responsibilities and school wasn't a chore it was like a choice.
00:23:40 I was doing things because I wanted to learn or wanted to get better at things.
00:23:44 I had realized that there were certain things that I just want to work towards and the time for gaming was like a couple hours every so often and then it just sort of became like you know less and less.
00:23:56 Now most of the time where I play games is only when I really feel like it and that's not every day.
00:24:01 I mean right now it is but like yeah like I used to go every day playing at least one game at a certain amount of time and now I can go a week without like picking up a thing.
00:24:13 My media consumption has really just been twisted in terrible ways where it's not that I don't think video games are worth my time.
00:24:21 It's just that I've really been funneled into YouTube right where it's right there on my desktop so so close within reach.
00:24:31 I always have tabs open on a Firefox and working Google Drive or something.
00:24:35 Just click that little plus type.
00:24:37 Click that little bell to get notifications every time I upload a new video.
00:24:42 Get notifications and you're fucking every five seconds you're going in.
00:24:47 You're a fucking fool and like comment and subscribe.
00:24:52 Share this video with all your friends.
00:24:54 Share it on social media and video games and movies and all that sort of stuff that I want to watch.
00:24:59 But it's just even just locating movies online even if I have to torrent or you can even go to some free illegal screen site.
00:25:08 It's so much easier to do YouTube which is really a problem and I've limited my YouTube usage.
00:25:14 Funnily enough while you're getting off the YouTube challenge I'm tying it not to the point where you did where it was like you know no YouTube ever because I realized that that just would like I wouldn't be able to do that so why even.
00:25:25 Munchy the way you were describing feeling about video games is a way that I felt for a long time about movies like I have.
00:25:33 I feel like movies ever since I was born I barely ever watched movies I have no I have no desire to like seek out movies to watch I hardly even know how I would do it.
00:25:44 And I feel that way in spite of the fact that logically I know that there is a Netflix subscription like directly down the stairs from where I'm sitting right now that I have free access to.
00:25:54 But I'm just like why would I ever do that.
00:25:56 What's the what's my motivation.
00:25:59 I think I did watch Fury Road a couple weeks ago which was pretty great but I'm like OK I watched a movie for the first time in like 20 years.
00:26:06 I think that's good for another 20.
00:26:09 I know that I would like to recommend them before and then I know that you know or you know whatever I watch a YouTube video as soon as I thought wow that would be good.
00:26:18 And I think just in like just in concept watching art as an artist is pretty valuable to broaden your artistic.
00:26:25 It is.
00:26:26 You know Mary Weather messaged me to give me his hot take on the whole pro Jared thing the other day.
00:26:32 And he like sort of after we talked about that he was he recommended me a manga and I was like man I should I should you know you know I don't know you know maybe I'll check out this man.
00:26:42 But in particular I should just I should read more manga as you get back into reading manga.
00:26:46 I should consume more media that isn't dudes on YouTube talking about other media because like what the what the fuck is that.
00:26:53 We should we should continue watching that anime.
00:26:55 We should mage I've been waiting to say this.
00:26:57 I'm sorry I snapped at you.
00:26:59 I think I think I when you see the thing about kicking me I took it as sincere and I'm pretty sure it was a joke.
00:27:05 The thing is I did I like directly rolled out of bed and like hit and like turned on discord to get in here and I don't think I was thinking properly.
00:27:14 I responded inappropriate.
00:27:17 OK I've been waiting to say that for like 20 minutes.
00:27:21 I appreciate it but it's it's fine.
00:27:23 I thought you were just doing the meme that we did on the quick quick draw.
00:27:26 Yeah.
00:27:27 The quick draw screen.
00:27:28 No the quick subscribe to quick draw everybody.
00:27:31 No I was just legitimately grouchy because I just woke up.
00:27:34 Can I say that real quick just in the middle here.
00:27:37 People are like where's the draw cast but like if you liked the draw cast then you would fucking.
00:27:41 Oh sure.
00:27:42 Fucking yeah yeah the draw cast has mutated and and split off like a like a tumor like a brain tumor exploding out of ones.
00:27:50 Out of ones head cavity.
00:27:52 You know like they like to do like like like a numeral to.
00:27:55 Yeah like a to like a T. O. O. M. E. R.
00:27:59 Split off into its own organism and is now the channel known as quick draw and there's what like four of them out now.
00:28:05 Yeah.
00:28:07 Hell yeah like that fucking link.
00:28:09 It's good.
00:28:10 I think all of us are in Tom hasn't appeared on episode yet but you can.
00:28:14 No yeah no definitely.
00:28:17 He isn't.
00:28:18 He doesn't do fucking 2D art.
00:28:20 He's too good.
00:28:21 Hey guys.
00:28:22 Me.
00:28:23 My name's Tom.
00:28:24 Okay.
00:28:25 Now I don't know how viable this is but what if Tom just did like a 3D model in the time that the rest of us were doing a 2D.
00:28:33 Like like a super low that would show us like a super low poly obviously like I'm sure it would be really hard.
00:28:39 Tom question is how do you do you think it was like how viable do you think is the idea of creating a 3D model.
00:28:46 Of a thing in like 15 minutes.
00:28:49 Is that even possible.
00:28:52 It would depend on what you're drawing like a human character probably not because you have to like model it then you have to rig it then you have to texture it.
00:29:00 What what if we were like what okay hypothetical what if it was like.
00:29:04 Okay last episode of the quick draw we revisited the idea from the draw cast of limited color palette and it was great.
00:29:11 My palette was the best.
00:29:12 What if we were what if we were like hey.
00:29:15 Hey here's a color palette make any model you want and use this color palette for it in 15 minutes.
00:29:22 Now I don't know anything about 3D modeling so I haven't yeah.
00:29:26 I mean at least for me it would not be enough time like I can draw I can still do drawing and be on quick.
00:29:31 I know I know I know I'm just thinking like what what if like what if some fucking weirdo like Tom were to come in here and in blender or whatever and do some some out there nonsense.
00:29:42 Just blend something together.
00:29:44 We have fruit is the topic though but so been so I'm sorry but you're gonna have to leave now you've been voted out.
00:29:50 Yeah well.
00:29:52 No I'm gonna I'm gonna reply I'm gonna I'm gonna reply as though you're sincere but this time I'm gonna be sad instead of mad.
00:30:00 You know and on the topic of broadening horizons and seeing yes please lots of different types of art.
00:30:07 I've also been feeling like YouTube is like generally just sort of sludge just sort of like grimy sludge that's you know it smells.
00:30:16 Well it's like it's like that it's like that you wouldn't want to live there but we all do.
00:30:19 It's like that debut video about how YouTube is the stomach acid.
00:30:24 Some yeah stomach.
00:30:25 Yeah.
00:30:26 Good.
00:30:27 Good.
00:30:28 Davoo is good.
00:30:29 Classic.
00:30:30 I agree.
00:30:31 I've been I've been having the same.
00:30:33 Where's the last couple days and like I've been thinking more and more about like really wanting to make that website.
00:30:38 I keep talking about where it's like it's like a YouTube but you can only everyone can only upload one video a week and that's it.
00:30:44 I hear.
00:30:45 There was this one.
00:30:47 I want to do that.
00:30:48 I want that to be a real site.
00:30:53 There was this one thing that I watched a Digi video and in the background I think it was a let's argue and there was a bunch of like a manga volume.
00:31:02 Like really small low low resolution in the backgrounds floating past him.
00:31:07 I saw one that was like how hang on.
00:31:10 I think that girl looks pretty cute.
00:31:12 Pause.
00:31:13 You know cut that image out.
00:31:16 Search by image.
00:31:18 I went on a journey to try and find this manga because you know I don't read that many manga.
00:31:24 I read One Piece and Bleach and Naruto are both over.
00:31:28 Dragon Ball Z is not really a thing.
00:31:31 One Piece is the only manga I see.
00:31:34 So I was like if this is good then this will be a really funny way to have found it.
00:31:38 So I searched by image.
00:31:39 I found the cover.
00:31:40 It's kind of obscure.
00:31:43 I forgot the name of it honestly because it turns out the girl was cute and the guy is a good artist but the manga was shit.
00:31:51 It was boring and stupid.
00:31:52 What was the premise?
00:31:53 I just liked that journey of like discovering something just because it's sort of like difficult to do.
00:32:00 Like rather than getting a recommendation from someone just like hmm.
00:32:04 Yeah you just like you found it yourself essentially.
00:32:07 You're like this looks interesting.
00:32:08 No one told me it was interesting.
00:32:10 I want to know the premise now.
00:32:12 It was there was a girl who had like someone she loved fell from a tree and this guy was like I'm going to cut down this tree.
00:32:22 And she was like huh don't do that fuck you.
00:32:25 And then it's like a romance between those two characters.
00:32:29 Wait between between her and the guy who wants to cut down the tree.
00:32:33 It was a boy.
00:32:34 It was a young boy who's like fuck this tree.
00:32:36 I hate this tree.
00:32:37 And you know it's obviously going to be like a romance between the two of them.
00:32:41 But then some weird like angel magical stuff came up and it was just sort of like that's not really cool.
00:32:48 That's kind of lame.
00:32:49 That's sort of like bad writing.
00:32:50 That's like zero out of ten.
00:32:52 What is gamathrone.
00:32:53 And she doesn't want to cut down the tree because someone she loved fell out of it and died I presume.
00:33:00 Well it was someone fell and broke their legs and couldn't walk.
00:33:05 But if the tree wasn't there they would have fallen to their death sort of thing.
00:33:09 I don't remember.
00:33:10 I don't remember it very closely.
00:33:11 I was just sort of skimming it was like this.
00:33:13 I mean it was very obscure that the scan lations I saw were like so low resolution.
00:33:18 It was very hard to see a lot of detail.
00:33:21 You know when like a manga is like it's online and it's so like grainy that it's certain lines are like cut out because of the low resolution like thin lines are sort of like dots.
00:33:35 The old days.
00:33:36 The struggle.
00:33:37 Yeah.
00:33:38 So it was but the girl was a good girl.
00:33:42 It just I like that design.
00:33:44 I really do feel like it's been a disservice to me like as a person.
00:33:50 I feel like I'm not as edified as I should be because I am so like cut off from media traditional media.
00:33:58 I guess I would call even though that's not really true.
00:34:00 I just mean like non regurgitated non stomach acid media which is the bulk of what I listen to.
00:34:06 But I am fixing that and I would notice what they say conquered it in any way.
00:34:12 But you know when you start a new thing and you can feel in the bowels of your bowels that you know that this is a good idea and like you know stick with this and good things will happen.
00:34:23 I made a big change in my life.
00:34:25 I've downloaded an application.
00:34:28 I want to just say to everyone in this group and in the audience something that you need to hear because we've all heard free will doesn't exist.
00:34:41 So here's the true red pill.
00:34:43 Self control doesn't exist.
00:34:46 It doesn't matter if you want to do something and if you say to yourself I'm going to make a change in my life.
00:34:53 I'm just I'm just going to you know I'm just going to go to the gym and then you stop thinking about it.
00:34:59 That you nothing will ever be accomplished.
00:35:02 If you think to yourself I'm just going to rely on my self control.
00:35:06 Self control doesn't exist.
00:35:08 You are an animal.
00:35:09 You're a beast.
00:35:10 You need a harness to able to be able to control your rage if left to your own devices.
00:35:17 No matter what I don't care if you're the fucking president you will turn into a carnivorous beast if left to your own devices.
00:35:25 You need to create a cage that is just comfortable enough around you to not you know you know chafe but just tied up to not allow you to be the depraved monster that you know that you are.
00:35:37 So instead of just you know being like guys you know what this is all cool and well.
00:35:42 I'm going to stop watching YouTube and I'm going to get you know in on some more traditional meat.
00:35:47 I'm going to play some games.
00:35:48 I'm going to watch some movies that will not happen because why would I I haven't changed anything about my life.
00:35:55 I've not changed the system under which I operate and if the system isn't changed.
00:35:59 Why would I expect a different outcome when I execute the program that is my life change that fucking code and what code am I changing.
00:36:06 I've downloaded a program called cold turkey and it's an app blocker that literally forbids me from opening YouTube and will not allow me to.
00:36:16 I hear you all clicking to fucking go Google.
00:36:18 It will not allow me to watch YouTube videos or various other things such as discord.
00:36:24 I have scheduled blocks under which like from like sleeping time literally it locks me out of my computer.
00:36:31 This is hardcore shit I'm dealing with right now.
00:36:35 I've seen that I was looking for similar things because I wanted to block discord for the first like 19 hours of the day.
00:36:42 So that I only jump on at the end to just like talk when I'm tired with friends and stuff.
00:36:48 But that fucking turkey thing you got to pay for it and as soon as money was involved.
00:36:55 I was like oh shit.
00:36:57 You recommended me another like timer app.
00:37:01 God what was it called.
00:37:03 The thing about like tracking how yeah.
00:37:05 Toggle.
00:37:06 You don't have to pay for that.
00:37:07 Yeah you fucking do.
00:37:08 I went to the website and it wasn't free.
00:37:09 No you don't.
00:37:10 The mobile app is free right now.
00:37:12 That's the one that's like you can like put in how much time you spend on things right.
00:37:16 Yeah.
00:37:17 Yeah.
00:37:18 I'm using it for free.
00:37:19 You're just a freak.
00:37:20 You're a freak.
00:37:21 I'm not.
00:37:22 No I'm normal.
00:37:23 I'm normal.
00:37:24 No.
00:37:25 You're a freak.
00:37:26 There's one thing about toggle.
00:37:27 Like section here.
00:37:28 I'm sure you can get a pro version.
00:37:29 Yeah you can get a premium thing.
00:37:31 Like enterprise is custom pricing premium and starter.
00:37:36 None of them are free.
00:37:37 I don't fucking understand.
00:37:39 Maybe it's only free on the mobile app.
00:37:41 No I have it on desktop.
00:37:43 You're used to freak dude.
00:37:44 Playing simple.
00:37:45 It knows it knows it and it won't let you download it.
00:37:48 Yeah.
00:37:49 All right.
00:37:50 I guess I wouldn't either if I were toggle.
00:37:52 One thing about toggle.
00:37:54 I tried.
00:37:55 I got daily own toggle the day you mentioned those.
00:37:58 Yes.
00:37:59 I was pretty good like 22 23 days in a row.
00:38:02 I remember 55 days dude.
00:38:05 So you know I've been doing that that prompts me at the when I turn on my phone like how
00:38:09 was your day.
00:38:10 It's like oh yeah.
00:38:11 It was good.
00:38:12 It's been good most days sometimes it's rare.
00:38:16 But toggle.
00:38:17 I tried for like a week and then I stopped using it because a lot of the time you know
00:38:23 you press a button it starts a timer you press the button again and that is like a chunk
00:38:28 of time that you have logged while you're doing something.
00:38:31 So when I would draw I would press the button draw and then when I feel like a needed breaker
00:38:36 press the button again and then at the end of the day I can see how many hours I'm spending
00:38:40 on certain things.
00:38:41 That's good.
00:38:42 It's just when I get distracted by certain things it's I don't remember because I'm being
00:38:48 distracted I don't remember to press the button and then the data started to become
00:38:52 all over the place like hours of hours of like oh I wasn't animating for those extra
00:38:57 hours.
00:38:58 I think I was doing something else.
00:38:59 Ah shit.
00:39:00 Ah shit.
00:39:01 I said.
00:39:02 And then I just sort of fell out of using it because it's it's it's too it's it's sort
00:39:07 of I can't really get gleaned too much from it.
00:39:11 The only thing that it's good for really is the idea that there is a timing thing going
00:39:17 on during work so that you're less likely to be distracted sort of like having a boss
00:39:22 over you like tapping his wrist like you better get this certain amount of hours in like
00:39:26 the only the only real benefit is the side benefit the main benefit doesn't work.
00:39:32 I get it.
00:39:33 I disagree and I think that the problem that you're putting forward is actually a feature
00:39:38 and one thing that I quite like about it I think there's so many minor transition costs
00:39:45 when you do what I do draw for a little bit make a few lines go back to YouTube click
00:39:50 on YouTube video watch for a couple seconds then go back to drawing the switching back
00:39:54 and forth between those apps obviously the clicking time is nothing but your brain just
00:39:59 focusing in on the drawing like oh fuck what was it doing our coding like oh fuck where
00:40:04 was I what was I doing milliseconds right but those add up and I think that just I mean
00:40:11 they are distractions YouTube videos and you know whatever podcast anything else that could
00:40:15 theoretically be in that position is a distraction and therefore detrimental to you being as
00:40:21 productive as you possibly could be.
00:40:23 So yeah you're right the data will be skewed so don't do it unhealthy behavior it's try
00:40:30 it's an active disincentive to do something that is bad and that I don't think is a good
00:40:35 thing so my click on that timer I think myself okay I know what I have to do I'm going to
00:40:41 work for whatever in many hours that I think is appropriate and I won't do anything else
00:40:45 because one thing that goes hand in hand with the cold turkey thing which is a you know I
00:40:51 can schedule out blocks is that I have clear working times and I have clear you know leisure
00:40:56 times and so I think myself okay I'm gonna be working for this long I'm gonna you know
00:41:01 start a timer I'm going to work and I'm not gonna be distracted because I know I will have
00:41:06 time to goof off soon so why be distracted now just get my work done I do it I clock
00:41:12 out and it's fucking primo dude it's fucking projudo wrap that shit in mozzarella and
00:41:18 eat that literally delicious it's fucking basil straight up straight up basil bro straight
00:41:27 up basil on a t-shirt cook on spain hey it's funny cuz like cuz like you know most people
00:41:32 like go to work and have a real job and it does that automatically you have work time
00:41:36 and relax time but we have to like do that ourselves I I don't know guys like for me
00:41:42 I have to have something in the background to work I can't work without the noise so hold on
00:41:48 yeah there are podcasts and music I think are well worth my time this isn't like a time to close
00:41:55 myself off in a cave like you know I have to be fully dedicated my work no brainpower can be
00:41:59 allocated there are many podcasts which are not two dudes talking about fucking nothing that I think
00:42:06 are extremely beneficial to my being to my core that I think honorically edify me and I think
00:42:13 it's important and fun for me listen to and there are tons of audiobooks I can listen to and just
00:42:18 tons and tons of music how often do I listen to music fucking never besides when I'm working how much
00:42:25 do I love music quite a bit so it really it's not that I'm I'm trying it's it's again it's I'm
00:42:32 making a cage for myself that is not chafe it merely restrains myself and makes me more disciplined
00:42:38 okay it's fantastic for me that's not what I was saying okay okay I'm just saying like I need the
00:42:45 noise to work like I can what I do is I find a playlist of something I don't particularly care
00:42:51 about but just interested just enough to sort of like tune in every now and then but it's not
00:42:57 something important or worthy that I have to pay attention properly for instance I've been so you
00:43:03 guys know though the people who like read out reddit posts and stuff like yeah yeah our whoosh or
00:43:10 our slash that happened so I I just find one of them and they upload like daily I go to play all
00:43:17 the videos and I just like have that playlist going in the background and I don't have to switch
00:43:22 between the videos is just constant noise and I don't particularly need to like I just I take in a
00:43:29 little bit just enough to get the context and and I'm drawing and I'm focusing on my drawing for the
00:43:34 most part I just I get I get just enough of that noise to keep me going and from getting irritated
00:43:39 because I get irritated when there's no noise and I can't focus on my work and then I just end up
00:43:44 browsing for forever trying to find something to listen to because I just cannot work on other days
00:43:51 if I if I find like find that like a really good song that's like really catchy or something like
00:43:57 that and I just put that song on loop for fucking five hours that one song on loop and while I'm
00:44:03 drawing because it just gives me that inspiration to draw and keep going and I just I have to and
00:44:08 like if I if I switch to a different song it changes the mood because you know different songs
00:44:13 different moods different feelings behind it but I need that one specific song so I have that song
00:44:19 on loop and that's how I work and I cannot work without the noise yeah I you know I think I feel
00:44:27 like if there's like a podcast that is truly edifying like super important and you really love
00:44:32 listening to it that would be way more of a distraction than something like a game grumps
00:44:37 playlist that you've heard like eight times already yeah exactly like something to know to dull the
00:44:44 brain like what was that thing that Japanese thing the bamboo that goes up and down with the
00:44:49 water feature oh yeah like the sound of running water is supposed to be calming and it's just
00:44:55 supposed to create like noise I think it's calming because it's just sort of you know a background
00:45:03 stuff like noise to to fill in so that you're not like noticing small sounds and thinking about what
00:45:11 they could be or you're not noticing your own bodily movement sounds it's just sort of like your
00:45:15 ears get to turn off while this noise plays well so you can focus more on the things that you're
00:45:21 looking at I don't disagree that white noise is valuable nor do I think that people shouldn't use
00:45:28 it and mage if you feel like you are not distracted by YouTube videos well that's fine I do that and
00:45:33 that's why I'm working to solve yeah yeah it has to be certain kind of content because if it's
00:45:39 something I'm generally interested in and want to listen to yeah I'm gonna get distracted by you
00:45:44 because I want to focus on that but if it's something I can just sort of like it's not important
00:45:51 it's kind of like trash but at the same time I'm vaguely interested it's just like ha ha it's a
00:45:56 funny sort of story but it's not mandatory for me to listen to it's not something important then I
00:46:01 can just have it in the background and not really see my brain works really weird where that there
00:46:08 are certain tasks I can do with background noise like if I'm drawing I'll usually have music or
00:46:13 something on in the background just to kind of keep part of my brain occupied while I'm doing this
00:46:18 but if I'm reading anything if I'm writing anything or if I'm or if anytime something gets really
00:46:26 difficult like if I'm doing like coding stuff for my game whatever and like I've run into a problem
00:46:30 all that has to immediately be turned off I need a hundred percent of my brain on this topic yeah
00:46:35 can't if I'm absorb any of it if I'm writing dialogue or sketching and coming up with poses I
00:46:41 can't listen to anything if I'm inking I can listen to something because it's a little more
00:46:45 mindless if I'm if I'm yeah if I am editing a video or something that requires more a lot more
00:46:55 focus I probably have to turn it on especially if I'm editing a video you have to listen to audio
00:46:59 them but yeah I need to turn that shit off but let's talk about let's talk about Twitter
00:47:06 hippo okay hippo I see here's my ego I see this red man comic I got into some internet drama
00:47:16 recently I said some guy was dumb I didn't need to say it but I said it anyway I guess I'm the
00:47:21 dumb one is this about me weeks ago I have like a stockpile of red man oh I say it's not okay I
00:47:30 read that I was ready to fight no I wouldn't I don't necessarily think you getting into Twitter
00:47:42 arguments is a bad thing I think it's kind of funny yeah and you clearly enjoy some of it yeah I do
00:47:48 but it you know I say generally arguing is exhausting and you get a little tired after a
00:47:53 while I mean like with the Mahler thing the other day like I got a little tired of answering to
00:47:59 like these fucking randos but I felt like obligated to explain myself when I thought they said
00:48:05 something that was like oh I can actually see how you might have a misinterpret I don't know
00:48:10 they're all mostly just fucking dumb idiots who were just like Mahler's smart and you're stupid
00:48:14 for you're not agreeing with him why do you think he's wrong haha you're the one who just thinks
00:48:18 he's wrong with no explanation like ah god damn it so that was terrible I don't know people
00:48:24 been criticizing me people say they hate my tweets they hate my Twitter people on follow me
00:48:28 because because I have opinions and because I don't just post something sarcastic with like a I
00:48:34 don't know a fucking shitty photo edit because that's what people want on Twitter I guess I don't
00:48:39 like that I like getting mad at people when they're stupid and I'm not gonna apologize for that
00:48:45 constructive conversation to be fair say what Tom Twitter can be difficult to have like a
00:48:52 constructive conversation yeah if there were no I could have made a much better explanation of
00:48:58 what my point was if well no one would read it to it longer I could have made a much more clear
00:49:04 explanation of what I was arguing about if yeah without the character limit but I mean you know
00:49:10 that's just the nature of it I think the I think the character limit is one aspect of it I feel
00:49:15 like a lot of it is just um reading everything in order is impossible like I heard that you were
00:49:21 having a thing with Mahler and I know what Mahler is so I was like oh I wonder if this is interesting
00:49:26 I couldn't follow any of it I tried like click through and through to understand what so wait who's
00:49:31 who's the where where does it go yeah to understand what I was talking about you would have had to
00:49:37 kind of follow the like the thread of the of the of his conversation with Lindsay Ellis like back a
00:49:43 couple posts to like see what he had been saying it's like that that's the sort of stuff that causes
00:49:49 people to come into half of one aspect of the conversation yeah see something out of context
00:49:56 essentially and react to it on its own and then it's like a like a high like a like a Richard
00:50:03 hive of scum and villainy and misinterpretations and like you know just people easily getting angry
00:50:10 at stuff um which is why it seems like a stupid place to do it but I don't know that's why you should
00:50:18 it's surprising me to shitpost it's it's surprising to me how little twitter not being my life at
00:50:25 hall has affected me I would think since I use it so often that I would there would be like a big
00:50:30 like gaping twitter a hole in my heart but it's been pretty quickly eaten up by youtube and just
00:50:36 work in general or just other things and so I haven't been on twitter in like probably literal months
00:50:44 literally I only have the quick draw twitter as my set login for every device because I use it so
00:50:50 little it's the only thing that I need to use it for and so I have no idea what this debate is like
00:50:55 who mawler is and what is even happening in it uh but I know that I don't want to know there's just
00:51:02 a well I'm gonna I'm just I'm gonna educate you anyway mawler is just a fucking intellectual
00:51:07 jackass that's all you need to know that's oh I hate you know he's an anti intellectual he made
00:51:13 he made like a like a eight part I don't remember the number of parts but like uh it totalled like
00:51:19 19 hours uh video series deconstructing hbomber guy's defense of dark souls 2 in excruciating
00:51:27 detail and I watched that because it was like he has a pretty good voice he talks in depth about
00:51:35 everything so it's like well he talks in he talks in depth in the sense that he like he specifically
00:51:41 points out every tiny thing that's why he makes like four hour long videos criticizing two hour
00:51:46 long movies yeah it's it's essentially like a reaction video but he reacts to every sentence
00:51:52 and every word I know that guy I'm yeah yeah oh my god every every single guy on youtube yeah
00:51:57 that that's the guy no wait hold on actually I just okay I I know who mawler is not by name but
00:52:04 because my friend showed me him a couple weeks ago and and and he said it like like he put on
00:52:12 mawler on his fucking ps4 on the tv and he said just watch a little bit of this and and and uh and
00:52:18 tell me what uh what the k like like what this is so I put on for like two minutes and I couldn't
00:52:25 like understand like what the point was yeah and then I clicked for me but there is no point
00:52:32 he's recapping the movie see frame by frame yeah yeah isn't that what like my little pony
00:52:39 people used to do I mean yeah the reaction community whatever whatever you would call it
00:52:45 like the idea of taking a video it's I think it's spawned like a near around the brony fandom
00:52:52 but the idea of like reacting to a video by usually youtube video by just like pausing what
00:52:57 they were saying saying well that's stupid continuing the video and then pausing against like
00:53:02 huh well that's also stupid you're pretty stupid huh and they would do that and get like into big
00:53:08 dramas disputes and it's just it's really good for drama it's really good for views yeah and people
00:53:12 started doing it about movies and games and all sorts of really just cranks that algorithm
00:53:18 um I mean I don't even necessarily hate it all the time because it's not it's not like everybody
00:53:23 who does that is immediately wrong about what this is that in and of itself very is not like
00:53:28 offensively it sounds like the everything wrong with uh sort of series that people are a little
00:53:34 bit yeah a little bit like that basically it's it's it's everything wrong with someone said this on
00:53:39 twitter and I agree it's like Mahler is basically everything wrong with if instead of each sin taking
00:53:45 like five seconds he talked about each one for like 12 minutes uh and there's no ding and there's no
00:53:51 ding oh but the dings though oh god I love that dings are so funny how how will how will I know
00:53:58 there is a mistake roll credits roll credits um god awful awful do you guys we we all hate
00:54:08 cinema sins right that's not a hot take right okay oh no that's not a hot take at all there's like
00:54:12 there's a whole community around videos about why cinema sins is not good and they're all I love
00:54:17 those videos I love that I watched a few um yeah there's there's one in particular by the guy who
00:54:24 does the everything wrong with everything wrong with well yeah he was his his one his breakdown
00:54:29 is really good um well so I don't know the thing I don't like about Mahler is like that he makes
00:54:34 those videos that's kind of dumb but the really bad thing is I mean you guys know that he claims
00:54:38 that his his criticism is objective like he said he literally says that and he says that everyone
00:54:44 else's is unobjective subjective and he thinks that the way to be objective in your criticism
00:54:50 is just to not read any subtext into anything and only point out objectively true things like plot
00:54:56 holes yeah this is a little strange the thing is though I don't I don't I don't know what quote
00:55:04 that like that information comes from he said it a bunch of times I swear well I mean I don't yeah
00:55:10 I mean sure I'm sure he has it's just sort of like there's a lot of a lot of uh yeah what would you
00:55:19 call it anger I guess about like um certain internet people for being having stupid ideas about stuff
00:55:25 yeah um it it just comes from a place of like lack of charity I can't think of charity
00:55:33 what like maybe he's you know he said that right yeah pretty dumb multiple times in multiple
00:55:39 contexts okay I'm not saying he didn't say that I'm not saying he doesn't believe it okay I'm just saying
00:55:45 why is that even a bad thing he's just a guy doing a stuff what hold on why is it a bad thing I mean
00:55:51 like hundreds of thousands of people watch his videos and agree with them but how is that so bad
00:55:59 because he's wrong do you know no not to me a lot of people can be wrong without even knowing it
00:56:09 all right here's my hot take here's my searing hot take uh people can be wrong some of the time and
00:56:14 write some of the time and people can be right some of the time and wrong some of the time when
00:56:18 people are wrong is it not is it not acceptable I'm not defending him I I just I'm just using that as
00:56:26 a branching of point for that that hot take because I feel like yeah it's you say one wrong thing and
00:56:33 then everything else you said is but it's not but it's not just someone said a wrong thing it's
00:56:39 someone says someone repeatedly says a wrong thing and hundreds of thousand people say yeah I think
00:56:46 that too is that not a problem I mean depends on what they're talking about is it just movies and
00:56:53 stuff uh basically yeah I mean it's it has a potential to be like if they're taking his word
00:57:02 as gospel so if he starts saying something more malicious uh like kill all the cats in the world
00:57:08 and it was like yeah fuck yeah you know then that's the problem I mean yeah yeah objective objectively
00:57:13 you know cats are bad we have to destroy cats oh you know objectively that's true and objectively
00:57:19 I agree no stop you know that that would be bad but it's like I think this movie sucks and everyone's
00:57:27 like yeah that movie sucks just like that's not good it's not it's not just that a movie sucks it's
00:57:33 a whole way of thinking that is like bizarre and and and like just misguided yeah I mean like you're
00:57:40 free to argue with these people if you think they're wrong that's you know that's what he does yeah
00:57:45 yeah you're so I'm not I'm not against uh you arguing with the people it's just like it's a
00:57:51 more matter of who cares when I see someone who when I see people that just have like bad logic
00:58:00 and are just arguing it's I'm sorry it happened unlike a totally like what happened fucked up
00:58:05 logical basis I want I want to be like hey let me point out why this is bad what well there's
00:58:13 just some like movie guy right the thing is the thing is as long as you're bitching about movies I
00:58:17 don't really care I mean he doesn't he doesn't really get into politics I mean I'm pretty sure
00:58:21 he's sympathetic to like the whole like anti SJW thing but that's not I mean in some of his reviews
00:58:27 like in the in the Captain Marvel it kind of I don't know you can kind of feel it in the way he
00:58:32 talks about certain things but he's not like explicitly being like no let me take this bit
00:58:36 to talk about why Trump isn't as bad as everyone says he is he's not doing like that or anything
00:58:42 uh I all right I feel like the general idea that a certain you know large people a large
00:58:48 number of people are thinking in a damaging way is it's sort of I don't know I think I'd rather
00:58:58 like look at it from like an observational perspective rather than thinking oh no these this
00:59:04 guy is um you know making all these people think this different way I feel like it's
00:59:10 all these people resonate with this way of thinking yeah and I just like I wonder why that
00:59:16 like I don't think this guy is contributing to anything in particular I feel like a lot of people
00:59:21 maybe watch cinema sins and then they think I'm gonna grow up and now I'm 12 and now I will
00:59:25 watch maula because it's the same thing but a little more edgy I guess I have no opinion on
00:59:31 this topic specifically as defined just now but I have something that's very adjacent to it I don't
00:59:37 want to switch off just yet respectful but but I will say that I don't know what I was gonna say
00:59:44 never mind fuck you okay take that out take take take what I just said don't take it out
00:59:49 don't take anything out leave it all in reverb it echo echo it and reverb it like munchies
00:59:53 and making a grandiose speech the rule like oh wow I have like to try and put music in the
00:59:58 background I like I like I like having an editor he he he can do all the things we can be like hey
01:00:05 hey hey hey editor hello did you say did you guys see maybe you didn't on twitter
01:00:12 oblivion falls uh video of him asking asking rebel taxi wears the podcast yes it was fucking
01:00:19 great yeah I didn't watch all of it because I assumed the crowd wouldn't get it and it would
01:00:23 be very awkward yeah I mean well that's kind of the point like of course they're not gonna know
01:00:28 what he's talking about and I'm like are they just having fun with the memeing or or like
01:00:32 where the pcp fans because there were a lot of people who seem to have yeah laughed there there
01:00:37 were there were a surprising number of people who's acted as though they like knew the context
01:00:42 yeah I was I was that was the part of a surprised about I thought you just kind of
01:00:46 get was gonna get weird stairs sitting back down but there were some people like high five and I'm
01:00:50 like yeah dude that's what I that's what I would have assumed too but no there were people that
01:00:54 were like yeah where is the podcast bro uh if if you were at that thing and you heard oblivion
01:01:01 falls say that comment below and say yes I'm both a rebel taxi congo and a pcp fan it's at uh
01:01:08 momo con I think how do you justify being both at the same time where's the loyal oblivion fall was
01:01:15 on um I'm not sure what the panel was but I was talking to him last night and he said he was on uh
01:01:20 he was on some panel at I assume momo con I'm pretty that's the one that's going on right now
01:01:25 right and uh I know yeah he's I remember what I was gonna say I was gonna say that you I don't
01:01:30 think there's anything wrong with like fighting for what you believe in the sense that you know
01:01:34 Ben you want to debate about you know this guy being wrong I agree with you yeah it's pretty
01:01:38 shit point pretty shit brain and you should probably take it to the toilet yeah but uh aside
01:01:46 from that which is fucking boring and who cares the real shit is uh what you said the beginning
01:01:52 hippo of people are just like really fucking like down like no charity there's no like you know
01:01:59 you fucking you you someone says something kind of wrong fucking obliterated gone forever now and
01:02:06 the problem is that now like what like what do you mean like oh kids these days people these days
01:02:12 are so ready I know I mean after making a bad after making a mistake it seems like when when
01:02:18 people make a bad point they become a bad person and I think it should like we should focus on
01:02:25 talking about ideas not people like if you have a bad idea shit on the bad idea all you want well
01:02:31 but don't hold the person you said I would I would have demonize everything I would have I would
01:02:36 have done that I'm just talking in like a general okay but let me just use my example is I would
01:02:41 have done that except that the people who jumped in to uh disagree with me didn't at least for a
01:02:48 while until I pointed it out like they weren't jumping in to be like here's why I think Molly's
01:02:54 argument was a good one or here's why I think this idea is a good one it was like they were jumping
01:02:59 in to be like look at this idiot who disagrees with Mahler and that was like end of thought I mean
01:03:04 you're always going to have fucking yeah like that you know that's just I'm sure we have sheeple
01:03:10 who would do that too it's just it's inevitable maybe I do it's it's the essentially a smug enemy
01:03:16 face they posted I don't even know if it comes from like someone literally responded was basically
01:03:21 just a pepe and like basically nothing else and I was like uh I love point taken
01:03:28 me and you've been we're talking about this sort of yesterday talking about like winning debates
01:03:33 I feel like that sort of like no charity stems from that sort of thing where it's like you want to
01:03:37 be right right you know you want to show that you are smart and deserving of an apple uh and so you
01:03:44 own it up are trying to be like dude so wait you're saying this like that's pretty unrealistic
01:03:50 and then and then and then and then they go ding roll credits and uh you get zinged on
01:03:55 fucking twitter and uh so you want to retaliate and say that they are a monster or a retard well
01:04:02 I feel like an apple can I get an apple please yeah I don't yeah yeah yeah hot hot take I don't
01:04:07 particularly like apples they're okay some of them are okay an apple and some some some are better
01:04:12 than others but in general apples are a pretty mediocre tear they're like a sea tear fruit like
01:04:19 secret tip for whenever you get into that situation if you ever say something that people have an
01:04:24 issue with and someone responds like angrily trying to like catch you in a gotcha moment you just have
01:04:28 to lean into it like because the the way that I tend to do these things and it seems to work like
01:04:34 90 of the time if someone like comes at you and is trying to be like trying to catch you in a loop
01:04:39 just respond very uh uh like genuinely like someone's like man that's fucking retarded you're an
01:04:46 idiot blah blah I'd be like okay uh how so like tell me and I'll just like you just start like a
01:04:50 normal friendly conversation like they're here like they're here to fight and you respond with like
01:04:55 well let's talk about it yeah and that 90 of the time it just turns into a normal discussion at
01:05:01 that point yeah because they're being listened to not challenged and then you can come to a
01:05:05 mutual understanding and then it just totally avoids the whole problem and if they're there to
01:05:09 argue in bad faith like they'll lose steam because like suddenly they can't do what they what they
01:05:14 wanted to do yeah I was a big fan of of digi's um everyone I forget what it was called did you
01:05:21 bro verse everybody digi bro versus everybody because it it sort of shone a light on that sort of
01:05:28 you know comment that people would leave they'd say hey fuck you you suck and then when he's like
01:05:32 well why do I suck and they're like well you know uh they just they wouldn't have anything really
01:05:41 specific they maybe would have like one thing like you said um you said this thing and like uh
01:05:47 and they would just look stupid and it was great I've actually had like a few a few comments I don't
01:05:53 remember who has PCP comments or just my on my videos like when people like said something mean
01:05:58 about me and I responded and they like immediately took it back and I'm like it's okay it's just I
01:06:03 think people sometimes forget that there's another person behind the screen and it's like so so they
01:06:09 just a lot yeah and so you just have to remind them sometimes it's it's not like hey I'm here
01:06:16 it's not like um anyone is like better than anyone else with regards to this because I feel
01:06:22 a little angry at certain faceless commenters when they make me upset and I like I don't respond
01:06:27 but I'm seething yeah but really they're just a person like if I knew them if I could see them
01:06:33 my way of doing I would like to be I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt
01:06:38 most of the time is what I think yeah my way of doing online discourse usually boils down to
01:06:43 when I have to respond to the way I just mentioned and then if I'm like on the other side like if I
01:06:47 feel like I want to like score a point on somebody instead of like going in very aggressively I try
01:06:52 and just like genuinely ask a question and give them an opportunity to restate the answer because
01:06:57 like when I make an assumption like that what I try and do is be like okay what they're saying to me
01:07:04 sounds retarded so instead of going in and being like you're retarded I'm like I want to give them
01:07:08 another chance to restate it to be like like basically asking for clarification because maybe
01:07:13 I like to try and assume I'm interpreting it wrong so I'll give yeah I try and like comment
01:07:18 sometimes or like respond to a tweet be like and give them a chance to rephrase it to make
01:07:22 sure I'm understanding it correctly and then try and usually ask a question from that to kind of
01:07:28 get to the nitty gritty of whatever the issue is I don't know I just I'm always more interested in
01:07:33 having a legitimate conversation even with people who blatantly disagree with me because I think
01:07:38 that's just not just more valuable but you'll get to a better answer I mean yeah it's it's very
01:07:44 gratifying when somebody who was giving you shit and then you actually do that because I don't
01:07:49 often do it sometimes I mean I don't get that much shit because I don't do that much stuff but
01:07:54 when it has happened and I do approach them like asking why and get the clarification it makes me
01:08:00 feel better to know that they don't actually they're not actually out to get me that much it was just
01:08:04 a little thing it's like well you know what that's just a fundamental disagreement you push back
01:08:09 you're both gonna leave mad but if you actually kind of like engage in a conversation you can
01:08:13 leave satisfied and that's way better for both parties
01:08:18 if only you could do things fucking swell and things fucking rosy cheeks and
01:08:25 again I feel like the idea of winning a debate is so
01:08:29 vile and disgusting well I feel like it's almost like a perversion of the idea the platonic ideal
01:08:35 of a debate explanation point debate obviously it's fun to put on your fucking war paint and you
01:08:41 know go out with your fellow labels to attack some other shithead labels and make them feel bad for
01:08:47 being labels and and then you know you can retire and it'll be a fun time for everyone involved
01:08:53 except your ruining culture and also I hate you and you're just breeding with just a truly like
01:08:59 fucking there's nothing in the world I hate more than just fucking circle jerking tribalism
01:09:05 where it's you know you go into a debate for the sole purpose of of going and like chuckling
01:09:10 into your friends being like man fuck this guy dude I'm gonna fucking tag on my twitter and say
01:09:15 something mean dude well in this well all right in this uh in this attention economy that we got
01:09:21 gone right like the purpose of the debate like from a practicals perspective you're right the
01:09:25 platonic ideal of a debate is that two people enter with opposing of views and and logic to
01:09:32 back it up and they argue their points one person leaves and they argue their points and in the end
01:09:38 we like we reveal the truth right we all we all like collectively arrive at truth through like
01:09:43 arguing different points but but the but the practical not even truth but just you know agree
01:09:48 over and saying to both of the arguments and maybe you could decide but but but the practical
01:09:53 reality is that the reason people are engaging in debates in platforms like youtube and politics
01:09:58 and stuff is not for that reason it's because doing so gets you attention and brings attention to
01:10:05 your viewpoint and generally speaking you're not going to convince anyone of well like you're not
01:10:11 going to convince anyone of your point if they already disagree with you well you're here you're
01:10:15 here to introduce people that maybe don't know haven't heard your side of the debate you're here to
01:10:20 like let them hear it for the first time this is why it's like you know you put up a you put up a
01:10:26 oh like evolution versus creationism right oh teach the controversy let's have a debate
01:10:31 your no no that's a bad example it's not a bad example but better example flat earth you put up
01:10:36 like like here's why i think the earth is flat here's why i think the earth is round you put
01:10:40 them both up there and they debate the winner in this scenario is the flat earth there because
01:10:45 if people are debating this idea as though it's like two sides of the same coin it's platforming
01:10:50 the idea as though it's like on equal footing with the round earth's idea and now like even
01:10:55 though 90 percent of people 99 percent of people are gonna hear them be like well this guy's obviously
01:10:59 crazy there's gonna be a few people who maybe have never heard the idea before maybe they're like oh
01:11:03 this is interesting maybe they're convinced by some of his logic maybe they get on board that's
01:11:08 that's that's what it's for it's to reach that new audience you disagree well wait wait hold on
01:11:14 what do you disagree with exactly i'm just i literally don't know i just i just i i still
01:11:20 think like even stupid ideas should be debated because like we don't know what's stupid like like
01:11:28 in this situation yeah like flat earth sounds pretty stupid and i i really don't think they're right
01:11:34 but like who gets to decide what's stupid and what's wrong okay okay let me let me take like an
01:11:40 individualist look at this hypothetical scenario you are say you're a guy you're a scientist maybe
01:11:45 you're like a famous scientist or something or you're a little bit famous you're a little bit
01:11:49 known you're respected you have the opportunity someone is like hey i believe that the earth is flat
01:11:55 let me debate you in like a broad sense i guess it would be wrong like to say like this guy is not
01:12:01 allowed to say that like the earth is flat he is allowed to say the earth is flat but if i'm this
01:12:06 scientist and some guy challenges me to the bit this debate i would net i would never say yeah
01:12:11 let's have this debate because i don't want to dignify that position with respect it's not worth
01:12:17 and it honestly makes me look it makes me look bad to engage with that idea
01:12:22 thing though here's the the other side of that coin because like ben your your point of saying like
01:12:27 by giving this these certain topics a platform that legitimizes them the flip side of that is that
01:12:34 if you're someone in a position of authority who should be easily able to dismiss a ridiculous
01:12:39 claim like this and you refuse to do so on the grounds that you don't want to give it a platform
01:12:44 you're also giving everybody who might be on the fence about it like well the scientists can't
01:12:49 defend it maybe that just makes them look more legitimate like they don't have a way to defend
01:12:53 it so so like both of them like no matter what happens you're gonna lose ground to stupid people
01:12:59 because they're just stupid people everywhere i don't think i don't think that's necessarily true
01:13:03 in every case i think when it comes to certain topics where like the person is easily reachable
01:13:11 and it would be like if they don't respond it's pretty obvious that they are deliberately
01:13:15 not responding then there's that aspect of it but if it's like you know you don't uh some scientist
01:13:22 has a paper written and you know a youtube commenter says hey scientist like you or like a twitter guy
01:13:30 it's like uh debate me like him ignoring that twitter user isn't necessarily going to give
01:13:36 that guy a lot of clout but if he writes a paper and he asks the guy to you know or peer review it
01:13:42 or like to to you know think about what this says read it please and then he still dismisses it on
01:13:48 the face of what's on the title then it's different then it's like you're you're you're deliberately
01:13:54 halting this potential thing and that's bad and that's seen as bad i wanted to say like like you
01:14:00 don't have to debate absolutely everyone who comes your way with a stupid idea it's it's not your
01:14:06 job so to speak to do that however like if you are trying to be an authority about
01:14:11 certain knowledge you should be able to also defend your position against legit like rivals you know
01:14:19 lately the people so people would understand your position as well because like not like you're not
01:14:25 born with the knowledge of science and that the earth is round you learn it from other people
01:14:29 and if some people are a bit skeptical about it i think it's like if you're a scientist who
01:14:34 you know believes and wants people to believe it you should be able to at least make a video in
01:14:40 responses like be like hey this is why earth is round this is the science behind it you know
01:14:46 well this reminds me of like people like evolution or a creationist being like science class should
01:14:52 teach the controversy right like like they're like oh well they're not gonna they're not gonna
01:14:57 teach they're teaching evolution in schools that's terrible okay how about this teach that some people
01:15:03 believe in evolution other people believe in creation and the answer yeah and the answer to
01:15:09 that is no because one of those is science and should be taught in science class and the other
01:15:15 isn't the other is yeah like the yeah the difference is because one can be scientifically
01:15:20 observed whereas the other not so i am on the side that can't be observed scientifically so i don't
01:15:29 know if you're if you're the scientist and someone's coming you and trying to argue the earth is flat
01:15:32 but like they're i mean their arguments are not i mean they might be like sort of dressed up in a
01:15:40 scientific way but like i don't know i wouldn't i wouldn't do it unless someone had like maybe
01:15:45 someone had like a really compelling argument that like was convincing people was like pretty like
01:15:52 scientific if someone's just got like a bunch of pseudoscientific nonsense that they're going
01:15:56 around arguing and i don't know i don't think it's worth debating it like if there's nothing to if
01:16:01 there's nothing to debate i guess what i'm saying is there needs to be some like meat to the argument
01:16:06 to make it like worth you know having the debate in the first place and i just don't think there is
01:16:12 any meat to like a flatter if this is a argument something sort of like pick on someone your own
01:16:18 size uh like the debate means more if the disparity between the people debating is very large you
01:16:26 know uh you know fucking i don't know Neil deGrasse Tyson arguing with uh me uh with munchie wears
01:16:35 tiny hats like two youtubers with very different subcats like um that would be like whoa you know
01:16:42 like you obviously the the the lesser viewed party would get a lot of views you know in whatever
01:16:48 context that is not not necessarily on social media could be just clout or like on the news or
01:16:53 whatever it is it's basically just if you're the smaller guy you'll get more you know so like i agree
01:16:58 with with ben on that that you shouldn't necessarily give people anybody um you know uh a platform
01:17:08 just to share to share the platform with you if you're so much bigger but if there's a guy who is
01:17:13 like um become on the level of a Neil deGrasse Tyson in in so much that he has uh a lot of people
01:17:20 backing him and he's kind of you know he can't ignore that then a debate is warranted and i think
01:17:26 you should like i don't know it when the when the sizes are about the same size it's fair enough
01:17:31 you should recognize that if you've got an audience if you've got an audience and you agree to a debate
01:17:36 with someone of an opposing viewpoint like you should basically do that with the understanding
01:17:42 that like no matter what happens you're doing them a big favor even even if you like quote
01:17:47 unquote win the debate you've done them a huge favor just by having it in the first place and do
01:17:51 and do you want to do that i think i think it's just choose your battles wisely sort of a sure sure
01:17:59 sure yeah any good advice talk about a very nice topic colors okay let's talk about colors let's
01:18:08 talk about sonic colors hold on hold on i just want to quickly because before the podcast started
01:18:13 and you weren't there i wanted to say i wanted to rant a little bit about colors okay yesterday
01:18:18 when i went to bed around uh who knows when i i i had this thought just like what's up with people
01:18:24 having favorite colors says the person who is devoted you know i i think i know what you mean
01:18:31 but go on yeah it's just it's just so odd i mean i can understand sort of like people having a
01:18:37 favorite flavor or something like that because it's a it's a way to sort of um it's kind of beneficial
01:18:43 to you especially like if you if you can tell if the food is properly cooked and whatnot or whatever
01:18:48 or like if you'd need a little bit of salt and you like taste is different but like um then like
01:18:54 you see colors and like there's like no reason to like one color over the other but people do
01:19:00 and for me personally just owning something in purple like gives like a plus 20 points to happiness
01:19:07 as opposed to as opposed to owning something exactly the same but not purple and i don't
01:19:12 understand why but i i would argue that that is the same as flavor and taste um because it's i mean
01:19:20 you know aside from like the i love the taste of raw meat that will kill me like that's bad
01:19:26 but like you know people have lots of favorite flavors you don't just eat one thing and i feel like
01:19:33 you know your colors can you know you have a multiple favorite colors
01:19:38 looking at the same color your whole life will get tiring i think uh even for you purple things
01:19:45 give you happiness because a lot of things are not purple and you see them all the time
01:19:50 and and it makes it a special thing to have a purple thing unless your room is entirely purple
01:19:54 which would be funny if if is the case in my mind it is slowly increasing the amount of purple in
01:20:00 in my room and my life uh oh i recently ordered like like two little um what do you call it like
01:20:07 no no devies no covers no cheats uh what's what's the blankets there we go that's the word uh two
01:20:13 blankets because like it was like literally five a.m and i thought like we need we need like a blanket
01:20:17 to like throw over our a sofa because the the one just like literally has holes in it that we currently
01:20:23 have so i ordered two one for myself and one for the sofa but what both of them were kind of too
01:20:28 small for the sofa and now i'm stuck with two purple blankets and i'm really happy because
01:20:32 they're both of them are so soft um i think i i talked about one of them in the last podcast
01:20:37 yes yes i still have it i'm so happy and it's like i wouldn't be as happy if it wasn't purple i think
01:20:43 i would still be happy because it's soft and comfortable but like it's also purple and with
01:20:47 butterflies and i like butterflies and i'm just so happy i i i would be right unlikely that this could
01:20:55 be uh explored scientifically but do you think that if you had like contact lenses in that made
01:21:03 everything purple forever uh that you would eventually get bored of seeing purple no
01:21:09 are you sure i am i am i am certain that's my final answer be sure but i don't know i haven't
01:21:16 been tired like purple i've had the obsession with purple like started started small but i have
01:21:20 this obsession with purple since i was 14 or so so it's been over a decade since i started liking
01:21:26 purple the and and it's the amount of me liking purple has only increased over time so i feel like
01:21:32 it's gonna grow until it consumes me so do you think it's part of an identity thing like the
01:21:38 fact that people know you're the purple person is like adding to it uh i don't know and i didn't start
01:21:45 exactly as purple honestly if you think about it because the original version of mage was
01:21:51 mostly black and white was only slightly purple eyes and she slowly grew purple over time
01:21:56 and now she everything is turning purple uh no i i don't know no it's just it just makes me happy
01:22:03 it's just a nice color uh speaking about you should listen to deep purple about colors i don't like
01:22:10 though like i have a i have a small personal grudge against the color green like it's not in
01:22:16 in its own fault it's a good color but the thing is like i was born in may and it's like the color
01:22:20 of may is green like oh what's your what's your lucky color why is the color of may green i because
01:22:26 like i i don't know someone decided and it's like wait hold on i don't know if that's true well look
01:22:33 up like birthstone alithuanian thing no no like uh if you look up birthstones they're color green
01:22:38 like what was your lucky color is like may if you burn me it's green the birthstone of may is emerald
01:22:44 that's true yeah you know my birthstone is diamond best one april bam obliterated oh fun uh i've got
01:22:52 moonstone pearl and alexandrite oh why do you have several all my favorite steven universe characters
01:23:00 moonstone is fucking sick pearls are like really good in dark cloud uh gem for weapon
01:23:06 enhancement and alexandrite is a fucking steven universe i'm sorry why do some why do
01:23:12 some ones get several ones why why is may stuck with green i'm so i'm so unhappy it's probably just
01:23:18 because people got confused and couldn't remember what the real one was or what the old one was and
01:23:23 they made up a new one and then people mixed up the two mage are you green is that what you're
01:23:28 saying right now no you're not green i'm not green i i i i think green hashtag free green mage
01:23:36 in in a like like like there was some kind of dimensional swap took place where like
01:23:40 our world's mage was green but like an alternate reality mage was purple and like some kind of
01:23:45 she fell through the the the green line the escalator yes she fell down she fell under the
01:23:49 under the escalator into the green light and swapped with her purple alternate self or something
01:23:55 okay i'm i'm on like birthstone color bernadette this this this is a lot of fucking colors i'm
01:24:02 i'm trying to find june color right but it's got black blue brown clear green pink purple
01:24:07 red and white okay one of these one of these has to be no but what may has like aqua black
01:24:12 blue brown clear green so it's like that there's a lot that i got i gotta figure this out i gotta
01:24:17 figure out what my color is colors for april yellow red and colorless colorless
01:24:24 all right how cool is that isn't your fucking because because of diamond that's so cool that's
01:24:29 my favorite i love that experience of what the worst and best color is here's some literally
01:24:34 objective colorless that's why i draw in black and white april april babies yeah all the trades
01:24:41 also doesn't connect lines when when drawing yeah that's also an april thing i think i see
01:24:45 that here on wikipedia yellow red and green i'm not looking christmas here is the objective
01:24:50 worst color everyone should agree with me here yellow because that's gotta be fucking
01:24:55 bright and saturated look good you ever seen a fucking dull yellow is just dull yellow is
01:25:00 not even yellow anymore it's just brown i mean all right i can just say that you say that but
01:25:06 i think the reason yellow is so bad is because computer monitors cannot show really yellow
01:25:13 what and to darken a yellow is impossible to make look good like if you have yellow paint
01:25:19 oh there's so many lovely things that can happen that what do you but on a computer monitor like
01:25:24 if you if you go to like to photoshop you can't get a good yellow what are you what are you talking
01:25:28 about dude there's a v source video this yellow thumbnail says this is not yellow and is it because
01:25:35 your display displays in red and green red red blue green yeah i know i i don't it wasn't it
01:25:41 wasn't just i don't understand that it was interesting it's still you like it looks yellow
01:25:46 it doesn't not look yellow i don't know yeah but if you look at certain things in
01:25:51 realality realality they are more colorful no it does i see in a yellow flower and i'm like
01:26:00 a sniff sniff it looks the same on a green i don't care i don't see that yellow looks bad
01:26:04 i'm just saying that it's not as versatile as other colors yeah that's true yeah but you're
01:26:07 saying you're saying that from the perspective of a digital artist who draws i am i am saying that
01:26:12 because i'm me hippo did you forget ring ring knock knock well i think the problem here is just
01:26:16 that yellow is a more narrowly defined like maybe in another culture there wouldn't be a word for
01:26:21 brown and yellow would encompass even dark yellow which includes brown all of you are insane you know
01:26:27 shut up lock you all you know you know that like i mean you know that like other cultures don't have
01:26:31 the same color words like no i know that's not what i'm saying yellow doesn't equal brown you can get
01:26:37 dark like like gross ass yellow that doesn't brown no hold on opening up manga studio right now
01:26:45 i will obliterate you with facts and logic right now you're saying you're literally what are you
01:26:49 talking about okay i'm literally you're literally this is this is literally the second yellow controversy
01:26:54 in the pc i'm drawing i'm drawing a big swatch of yellow right here right now and then i'm putting
01:27:00 and i'm putting would be such a peaceful topic and i'm putting it down not i'm putting the the
01:27:04 darkness i'm sliding the down the darkness that are halfway and i'm drawing and it's like an
01:27:08 olive green that's why we can't have nice things it's like olive color it's no longer yellow
01:27:13 okay uh i have a question okay correct me if i'm wrong but like in japanese didn't like the
01:27:20 color blue and green used to have like the same word for it i'm not sure but maybe what's what's
01:27:27 japan okay i have heard i've heard that uh the ancient greeks did not have a word for blue
01:27:32 which is why that uh in the odyssey homer describes the sky as being like burnished bronze
01:27:39 because there is no word for blue for him to use to describe it and people didn't use to have purple
01:27:46 either so that's why a lot of flowers are called like use the word blue in their titles despite
01:27:51 being purple i'm angry like violets are blue yes lel literally violet
01:28:02 yeah i'm looking i'm looking at yellow i have like a perfectly saturated yellow here and i like if i
01:28:07 slide the slider down even a little bit it very quickly turns into like an what i would describe
01:28:12 as more like a puse or olive color it's it's still just looks to me as though it is a dark yellow
01:28:20 description wrong it's definitely wrong wrong yeah wrong no you know what you know but i think
01:28:28 you like to be a bad person because you just said i love to be like a bad person i love being a bad
01:28:32 man to my friend hey by the way guys i don't know if you guys know this but like episodes don't have
01:28:37 to go on for like three hours in case you didn't we could we could do voicemails literally right
01:28:42 right i've nearly finished i've nearly finished my color uh quiz i'm nearly there it's not the
01:28:48 voicemails i don't really i don't fucking care about this and fucking you know what yellow love you
01:28:54 love you boy well i mean we can't we can't move on to voicemails if we're done taught if there's
01:28:58 nothing else to live we want to talk about yeah yeah you know okay i just want to say because
01:29:02 nate wasn't here i did the voice yellows again for the second time in a row and i just want to say
01:29:06 that this was like possibly the worst voicemail batch we've ever had hey did you get one did you
01:29:13 get one from terezi yes i did okay just checking i want to say just quick quick
01:29:19 disclaimer about i still about the colors i i i think green is a neat color i just don't like
01:29:24 it being attributed to me that's all i nobody does that though myself because we're talking about this
01:29:30 like people like people like you know the whole may thing is is okay it upsets me i've well i've
01:29:37 never heard of it so well i i i grew up like see i grew up with like a girly magazines were just like
01:29:43 oh what's your horoscope you're your your sign you're your lucky color your lucky number stuff
01:29:48 like that and it's always green in between in between like going out on like marauding like
01:29:52 raiding campaigns in like the bombed out wasteland of lithuania and like like like you know plundering
01:29:59 you know plundering uh like ancient ruins and stuff and like beating people with baseball
01:30:03 bats you were reading like teen girl magazines that were telling you about your birthstone how
01:30:07 to incorporate it into your wardrobe to be fair i only read one magazine it was like it wasn't
01:30:12 even a magazine it was like the the the way the wings no no not the wings the witch the witch comics
01:30:18 the only reason i brought the yellow thing is because i wanted everyone to be like ha ha yeah
01:30:21 me too much yeah i also know the difficulties of picking correct shades of yellow this is
01:30:25 the worst topic ever i want to kill myself uh it's blue i'm blue god so i'm gonna start out like
01:30:34 worst to bet so there we got like i don't know maybe like 20 voicemails we're down to six uh and
01:30:40 like maybe a half of these are even slightly good so uh we're going to we're going to start with uh
01:30:47 my personal favorite and i feel like one that uh sums up the sort of general quality here
01:30:53 and then navigate over to our slave real quick whip them real quick yep yeah here we go make sure
01:30:57 you turn up your uh your speakers really high for this because it's extremely quiet
01:31:04 fuck been sane

01:31:41 go back and correct me next next next next we have a uh a voicemail from the embodiment of
01:31:51 the pcp voicemail we have him himself calling into the show oh god hey guys it's me a pcp voicemail
01:32:00 here i just wanted to leave a message for all those commenters out there cutting themselves
01:32:04 because the pcp doesn't read their comments uh just use me instead at least one of them is
01:32:10 gonna have to listen to you and you know voicemails are to be honest just the cooler way to go right
01:32:16 you really want to be a part of a youtube comment section no yeah i agree we provided you we provided
01:32:21 you that we don't use that we don't know who's that that's my roommate pcp comment section
01:32:27 i'm really sorry man i didn't think you heard that it is his roommate the pcp comment
01:32:31 said it if i thought you were in earshot we stop crumpling maybe i think no it's like the typing
01:32:42 of a okay there's no reason to bring my mother into this and what the slur is really the could you
01:32:50 really spell him right see see comment this goes on for like an hour so i'm gonna disconnect right
01:32:54 here but uh in case you fucking that hosts are too unruly and you literally couldn't understand
01:32:59 uh this this is the pcp voicemail he called in but his roommate the pcp youtube comments uh came
01:33:04 in started typing in a came that he was speaking it seems like comment section is a real asshole
01:33:09 but fortunately we've given you an out so you don't have to you don't have to be like him you've
01:33:13 got the speak pipe right at your disposal link in the description i we did the meme that we
01:33:18 don't read the comments came from uh because i do it's not really a meme it's just sort of like
01:33:25 an implicated you know implicitly people don't assume that the youtube creators are human beings
01:33:31 that we were saying that we thought the comments were bad because the people assumed we didn't read
01:33:35 them even though we do we've talked for the last like two episodes about how contrary to popular
01:33:40 belief we actually do most of us do read the comments here's the thing we read the comments but
01:33:44 none of them are good enough to warrant responses yeah i respond if one if one makes me mad enough
01:33:51 i respond so uh that's how you get how you trick me uh that now we're gonna see like a hundred like
01:33:57 hey ben hey ben fuck yeah and i'll and i'll spend an entire day responding to all of them if you
01:34:03 address me specifically i'll probably respond i don't just mean refer to me like like say my name
01:34:09 in the comment i mean like if you're speaking to me i will speak back most of the time speaking you
01:34:15 shall be spoken to here's also another one that i'm gonna cut off prematurely uh actually you know
01:34:19 what nah i'm just gonna let it go for the entire time who cares oh this is the wrong one oh whatever

01:38:09 was uh uh deemed in anticipation about uh last night late at night saying uh i was uh messaged
01:38:16 by the person who recorded saying to make sure to play on the podcast and i said okay yes and so i
01:38:21 am doing it now this is the one i think it is hey quick before they realize i don't have a browser
01:38:25 type hctps colon slash discord.gg slash lowercase n lowercase t uppercase s uppercase r uppercase
01:38:32 x lowercase e lowercase x type nr quick quick quick quick and let's rowdy thrash thrash thrash thrash
01:38:39 thrash thrash no no okay all right he do that except at the end it's not a lowercase k it's
01:38:45 not a lowercase x is lowercase k so do that but typical rowdy this is a typical rowdy just
01:38:52 why the fuck haven't you guys bought a fucking url yet for this thing what do you notice the discord
01:38:58 invite don't worry yeah don't worry about you can buy a url that just reconnects to any url you
01:39:06 have rfck.com's bought by some fucking chinese company no no no you get rfck.slime you could
01:39:12 probably do that no there's no slime check wait is there there's a link there's a link to the discord
01:39:16 on the slimecorp website right yes okay well just go you go to slimecorp.net yeah go to slimecorp.net
01:39:23 and you can uh you can find your way there all right here's the last one hi it's terezi pyro
01:39:32 so i was hanging out with discord yeah and my discord baby risco wants to get bottom surgery
01:39:39 he really wanted me to ask this the dating bottom surgery give you a second virginity
01:39:47 what's up with that okay so so in case you're not trans aware like how i was i was trans unaware
01:39:55 bottom surgery is is you know when you change your genital to the other one so oh i thought it was
01:40:01 just like getting a bigger butt yeah i thought that too that's that's ryan agents first as well
01:40:06 okay okay so the question is the answer is clearly yes yeah yeah you think you think so yeah i agree
01:40:11 i agree i well i'm gonna disagree with a caveat i don't think that changing okay if you have a dick
01:40:17 and you're and you've fucked with your dick and you're not a virgin and you get even you change
01:40:22 your dick into a vagina and then it's like oh am i now a virgin again no but what i think is that
01:40:29 what i think has happened is that you have previously lost your dick virginity but you
01:40:35 have a new virginity to lose oh yeah you have you have you have a different it's a you've
01:40:41 lost you've still lost your old virginity you've still lost that but you there is a separate
01:40:45 virginity that you may that you lose independently plus virginity yeah well well like it's like
01:40:51 erica moan said on strip search like you have multiple virginities like you can lose your
01:40:55 butt virginity that's a separate thing you're you're you're very various different kinds of
01:40:59 virginities ah so many what a cornucopia you can collect them all your sneeze virginity yeah the
01:41:05 first the first time you do a big sneeze that's you're losing your sneeze virginity and big sneeze
01:41:10 and so on and so on in that order uh i really i thought that you know we were when we were talking
01:41:17 about this um we were talking about how i terezi and what is the terezi risk i don't know it doesn't
01:41:24 matter it really sucks for you that risk is trans though no it doesn't um well she'll have a vagina
01:41:32 soon changes nothing so it's fine um the the uh man i think nate would probably have more to say
01:41:38 about this i think he would probably argue and play devil's advocate in response to this question
01:41:42 nate would probably say oh i hate old people do me too uh damn okay well this this episode
01:41:52 fucking god kill me all right why why are you so why are you so stupid you are munchie you're being

01:45:48 vapors three out so one month from today it's god damn i know right uh that's and that's what's
01:45:55 happened too long it's been so fucking long i don't don't listen i'll cry if we start talking
01:46:00 about how long it's been and you nobody wants to see that what's not saying that is a bad thing
01:46:05 okay you know what guys we don't talk about shit that we actually care about we only talk about
01:46:09 shit that's like oh you know we can say that like you know i guess that's like a thing that we can
01:46:12 say let's talk about shit that we actually is that it's actually like matters and that is actually
01:46:16 important in any way that pertains to us specifically and our personalities or our careers as a
01:46:21 internet career because we never do that we're talking about like oh you know on twitter like
01:46:24 someone was like bad and like i don't like bad people you know when people are like stupid uh
01:46:29 yeah i do too i also know that ben that's important to me you don't you don't you don't talk you
01:46:35 let's talk about your fucking comic because you've been on a tear lately you've been fucking
01:46:38 actually making pages but no one knows about it because they're hidden behind the fucking
01:46:43 howl hall the fucking fortress yeah that is your patreon yeah yeah um uh well yeah i mean i think
01:46:49 i've talked about this before i mean i did that because it's like well my patrons should have
01:46:54 some sort of privileged access to the content right so it's like well i'll just until the
01:46:58 comics done i'll just put them on patreon only which is like i mean before that it's not like i
01:47:04 was releasing them one at a time i just wasn't releasing them anywhere until i had the whole
01:47:08 thing done and released it all at once um but i don't know you were saying that like i should
01:47:14 just fucking release them one at a time and maybe yeah there there's so many people that like want
01:47:20 to be ben saint fans but just have no concept that you are actually doing work as far as like a
01:47:24 lot of people concerned you are doing nothing as far as a lot of people are concerned yeah i
01:47:30 feel like this exact conversation already i think i think so too this exact conversation yeah i'm
01:47:35 pretty sure i'm sure you brought this up okay whatever i mean my i mean my hope is that like
01:47:39 when it all comes out at once people will be like oh he was working on something this whole time my
01:47:44 preconceptions have been shattered i'm gonna go to patreon.com slash ben saint and show my appreciation
01:47:50 before but ben didn't agree with me so he has to agree with me this time i'm just i think that time
01:47:56 and this time i'm just equivocating because i don't know what's real and i don't know what's
01:48:00 true and i don't know what the right thing to do is everyone press one of ben should just release
01:48:05 his fucking comics normally well like a normal person yeah okay well everyone's gonna say yes
01:48:09 normally as in like one chapter per week no no like you know he releases pages like he's done
01:48:15 with them and they on his website or maybe like it's like you know you get them like a day before
01:48:19 as a patron or something you know what i think i think that is generally a bad idea with the format
01:48:27 of ben's comics because uh certain things read better when they're all in one chapter you know one
01:48:38 page that may not have dialogue on it like the last one it just like i mean i don't know how it feels
01:48:43 for the patrons who who get to see it yeah um as it comes out the same problem little bit by little
01:48:48 bit but i don't know whether that would really it like is it worth people thinking that ben does work
01:48:57 to have them have like a kind of worse experience reading it it's not a worse experience because
01:49:03 they're able to get it sooner and be able to have it more in their mind it's definitely not
01:49:08 optimal as reading it in the backlog it's definitely a worse experience to read something
01:49:13 one page at a time that's a continuous this is why this is this is why i did it in the first place
01:49:18 and didn't and just and didn't release one at a time and waited until it was all done i've run to
01:49:22 this problem myself because i'm working on this on the game right now and like i have i there's
01:49:28 nothing to release now that the game's out and have to work on an entire fucking video game like
01:49:32 am i gonna release every level at a time like over the course of like a year and that's completely
01:49:36 different i mean you could you could do that i could but let me finish yeah because i've had
01:49:41 this problem like even when i was doing comics like three years ago i was having a problem
01:49:45 like i've tried wanted to release big things because like it was a story and told a story and
01:49:49 like the the answer unfortunately is just make more shit yeah the way that's that's always the
01:49:54 real answer the way to do it would be work on the big vapor's comics and then like every like one or
01:50:00 two weeks release like a four-pan a little like gangstrip with the characters to get people to
01:50:04 care about the characters for the big release i've been thinking about that running two comics
01:50:07 like that's really the way to do it and it just you know it just takes more work but like you
01:50:11 just kind of have to nut up and make it happen i've been thinking about that like what if i did
01:50:15 not exactly like the red man thing but what if i just did like sort of like a like a like not much
01:50:21 like in the way of new drawing just like the static character just like a little bit of like
01:50:24 dialogue just like a little like dialogue short comic snippet thing um get my i don't know writing
01:50:30 juices flowing a little bit uh or something you do like a sprite comic with the vapor so you just
01:50:35 have sprites you can like reuse all the time um boy yeah and just like wait wait what if i put them
01:50:43 just do garfield but with what if i put them right like i have like an isometric view of
01:50:47 like their room and i made little like little like sprites of them and i just move them around the
01:50:51 room right it's it's and i made homestuck and i just what if i made homestuck that's kind of
01:50:56 that's kind of cool it is cool i think i gotta go very soon but i just want to say
