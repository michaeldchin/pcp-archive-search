00:01:01 Uh, tell me, Ben, what convinced you about the big lie?
00:01:06 Um, why do you now believe in the big lie right now?
00:01:09 Um, it's just because women wouldn't date me because I was a conservative.
00:01:14 So to open up my dating pool, to get those blue-haired sluts, I had to, I had to get the jab.
00:01:20 Nice.
00:01:21 I had, that they had to stick me so I could stick them if you know what I'm saying...

00:01:55 nice it was nice so you should say for well another week until the there's the
00:02:03 new variant comes out they've been working on it for a long time I keep
00:02:09 seeing I saw an article that's like oh there's a new variant coming out of
00:02:12 China it's like well okay just in time just in time for the Omicron booster
00:02:16 all right you gotta admit those Chinese are effective they um they just keep
00:02:22 they just keep pumping them out they just keep they just they can't keep getting
00:02:25 away with it if there's one thing you can't take away from the Chinese is
00:02:28 their workman like attitude and always on schedule for it us you know they're
00:02:34 they're humble wisdom they're down to earth home homey mystical powers there's
00:02:43 various spell their various spells and enchantments yeah you can't you can't
00:02:48 stop them you're describing the Chinese people from the fucking
00:02:52 Gremlins movie I'm described I haven't seen Gremlins you haven't seen
00:02:59 Gremlins no I've never no I haven't seen it a long time I can't remember it a
00:03:03 Chinese family wait there was the guy who had the he had the the Gremlin the
00:03:10 the ancient Chinese guy with the gremlin and you mean Billy Peltzer no it's
00:03:16 like the little little boy goes into this this ancient Chinese gift shop and
00:03:20 there's a gremlin in there and he's like oh don't feed it right that's what
00:03:25 happens don't think that's the plot of the movie yeah and how I understand it
00:03:30 he says don't feed it and the little boys like why and then he then the guy
00:03:34 says oh because he's currently working it's not his lunch break can't eat right
00:03:39 hmm
00:03:42 um iconic scene the the China what do we try I think China thumbs up okay hey
00:03:57 political news Liz trust is dead yeah finally let's trust is cute I think she's
00:04:04 cute I like why did you put why did you do that why did you think she's cute
00:04:07 I like her I mean if she were if she were like if she were like 20 years
00:04:12 younger she'd be she'd be assault she'd be a solid a solid six out of ten which
00:04:19 is a 10 out of 10 in my opinion why why would you say it why would you do that
00:04:25 why would you do this like her face just like her face look I've never heard
00:04:30 her speak I don't know anything about her that would ruin the illusion if you
00:04:35 just think I just think she's I just think she's neat I just think she's
00:04:39 cute confirm something for for us before you continue all right if less
00:04:48 trust was a POC women would she still be attracted to you attracted yeah so
00:04:56 trust was it was a POC was a POC woman yeah I mean it would change it would
00:05:06 change her appeal would change her appeal that's very diplomatic way of
00:05:11 saying that insane very very political answer and the topic is politics after
00:05:17 all so you're not you're not off topic but you might be off you might be off
00:05:23 colored in other words you know really much another that I have to say about
00:05:28 the Liz trust thing being gone it's just that like some last episode of talking
00:05:34 about it and then I think even before the episode came out she was gone so it
00:05:39 was out of date yeah so someone I saw a tweet that was like as an American the
00:05:46 concept of a politician resigning because they fucked everything up and
00:05:50 everyone hates them is like completely foreign and that's that's exactly how I
00:05:55 feel like wow she left just because she failed and ruined everything like what a
00:06:00 what a concept yeah amazing it's it's I mean I don't know why it's different I
00:06:08 think it's like you can resign whenever you want but like to save your political
00:06:16 future like you can get bullied out by say by all the other politicians saying
00:06:21 yeah we're gonna we don't like that and what future do you have what what
00:06:26 political future do you have when you take over the part of the as prime
00:06:30 minister and then you're like oh fuck I have to stop being prime minister
00:06:34 immediately is a prime minister like the endpoint you know everyone's trying to
00:06:39 be prime minister or something you know it's pretty good yeah get big money you
00:06:44 get big money for it even after you she saw the view from the top from the top
00:06:49 of the world she's like never mind I like it here I think the only reason she
00:06:56 stayed as long as she did was because of like ego like it was like oh but I'm I
00:07:00 would do such a good job if only everyone in the entire world would just agree
00:07:05 with my idea it's that scene from the beginning of Dark Crystal when the
00:07:09 emperor is dying and the Chamberlain tries to take his staff or whatever he
00:07:14 said I am still emperor and then he crumbles to dust kind of like that scene
00:07:21 at the beginning of the Dark Knight Rises where Bane steals the plane Liz
00:07:26 Truss is the plane in the scenario exactly yeah exactly right because I
00:07:32 haven't seen that one actually you haven't seen the Bane movie no I haven't
00:07:36 seen the Bane movie just watch the first five minutes and that's like the best
00:07:41 part of the movie yeah the first five minutes that plane seemed iconic can't
00:07:45 believe they whitewashed Bane it's okay so mad look so mad that they erase a POC
00:07:52 voice yeah exactly that's true I've heard I've heard people say that he's like
00:08:00 Mexican right he's original or yeah he is Mexican look I remember reading that
00:08:07 comic like years ago you know what I'm you know what Bane's like original like
00:08:12 origin story was I forget it was um he was born in a prison and then he I mean
00:08:20 that kind of happens oh he was born in darkness molded by it well he was kind
00:08:25 of there was like a there was like a teddy bear that told him that you should
00:08:28 kill Batman and he's like oh okay I'll do that I'll go murder him right now I see
00:08:35 and he and he devised a team of other a very diverse team and there was a guy
00:08:41 with a lasso on his team that was very important he had a guy with a lasso on
00:08:45 his team to confront Batman because you know that's amazing in case Batman
00:08:49 through he can't get away he's in ropes and my understanding is what you're
00:08:54 telling me that his origin story is that as a child a teddy bear told him that
00:08:57 he should he should assemble a team to kill Batman kind of it's a very I'm
00:09:01 giving you a very rough version but I know at one point his teddy bear told
00:09:05 them was it the teddy bear from Dengan Rompah yeah he was a big anime like all
00:09:11 Mexicans persona five or three like all Mexicans Bane was a really big anime
00:09:17 and he modeled he modeled his like that's why he got all swollen he saw Goku he's
00:09:23 like oh I gotta get big and then he's like and then Goku he fights strong
00:09:29 opponents and Bane was like I gotta fight the biggest guys around and who's
00:09:34 bigger than Batman Superman yeah but you know you gotta start you gotta start
00:09:38 somewhere you know right had a sensible goals if you were to you know yeah you
00:09:45 gotta take on all the justice like you gotta start with Batman first he is he
00:09:48 is human after all
00:09:55 yeah exactly he just has gadgets and if you have a guy with a lasso on your team
00:10:00 you could like catch his batarangs in midair hmm yeah right easily it's the
00:10:05 effectiveness so now it's like rock-paper-scissors lasso beats
00:10:10 batarang right right right you guys um you guys up for a quick for a quick
00:10:19 little game yeah I love games okay I'm gonna post an image filled with filled
00:10:25 with colorful characters and I want to see how many of these characters you can
00:10:30 name oh should we just shout shout the names out what a time I suppose yeah I
00:10:37 just I guess from left to right it's like a lineup of characters and if I just
00:10:40 want to see how many can name I've been asking a lot of people this question I'll
00:10:45 see if I can name one I'll count how many I can name without naming them all

00:17:39 it's Animal Crossing so he's an actual fucking like bear oh yeah yeah that's so
00:17:46 obvious I don't know why I thought whatever oh they kind of reminds me of
00:17:52 the twig from Animal Crossing oh it's because he's like gay it's like that
00:18:00 fin boy bunny it's um it's funny when people draw the whole like thick Animal
00:18:05 Crossing characters when they all just have like like oval bodies no one really
00:18:11 has like so no one really has like defining like body types in Animal
00:18:17 Crossing well you mean like when they draw like the characters torso it's just
00:18:22 like the cutesy animal crossing shaped torso but then they have huge thighs and
00:18:26 a butt yeah when they um when they gave a like on the fat pussy with a fat butt
00:18:33 or the fat tits the rest of herself is just sort of like cartoon yeah you got to
00:18:39 give it up to the Japanese they really like made objectifying women into an
00:18:44 art you know hell yeah somebody had to do cuz here and I'm here in the West like
00:18:52 when we objectify women it's like oh she's got fat tits fat ass and she's like a
00:18:56 sex sex slave and she does she does anything you want her to do right but
00:19:01 in Japan it's like oh this woman was turned into a like a flesh light and
00:19:07 she's slowly losing her like consciousness as you're fucking her I don't
00:19:13 wait I don't get it what was your first statement related to that sound pretty
00:19:21 similar no and no no and one and sure and one she's like one is base she's
00:19:27 being degraded and the other one she's literally turning into an object and like
00:19:32 in a way like in a way like dying but in a like almost like existential like
00:19:38 abstract way wow like that yeah it's horrifying they're like I really get
00:19:44 upset when they do the thing where it's like haha she's having so much sex and
00:19:49 now let's cut her arms and legs off is not when do they do that when the fuck
00:19:54 do they do that like oh like get get her just so that she's just a torso and
00:20:01 you can fuck it I'm like why would you do that I don't I don't I don't know
00:20:06 the bed you ever I mean I like I never I like never see that I've never I mean I
00:20:10 can imagine it but like that upon it often enough to know that it is
00:20:14 definitely a trope a trend yeah I see that I see that before too I mean
00:20:20 upon some gross stuff usually it's not like that it's not like like gore
00:20:25 sometimes it's like oh I have like attachable legs and arms I can take
00:20:29 them all off haha and like their stumps now it's my hentai that happens in
00:20:34 clown milk but now no one will know isn't clown milk isn't clown milk still
00:20:41 available by special order it's available and pre-order you can get
00:20:46 pre-order right now gamers the yeah the the the the clown milk the clown milk is
00:20:53 real tell tell us tell us what you've learned tell us what you've learned from
00:20:58 your Kickstarter experience yeah let me out before before anyone rushes to point
00:21:03 out every little thing that I could have done and yeah in retrospect let me I
00:21:09 already wrote down a list of things and if I then list something down you tell
00:21:15 me later as I go through the list of things but oh but the most I mean yeah
00:21:21 I'd like to hear what I'd like to hear your observations well first first and
00:21:26 foremost everyone wants me to kill myself that was that was mistake number one
00:21:29 obviously I could have told you that I think number one was promising people
00:21:39 three thousand dollars that's probably a big mistake eat the artist hang on
00:21:44 yeah when you say I mean I mean I mean I would phrase I would phrase that
00:21:49 differently it would say I would say like the goal was too high the goal was
00:21:54 too high I do agree and yeah could have been there should have been a deal about
00:21:59 like percentages or like oh we'll get to I mean the thing is that nothing was
00:22:05 like ridded and stowed and it's all like good faith among like three friends you
00:22:09 know yeah really I mean ultimately if I if I pulled like a dick mood and didn't
00:22:16 get it no one paid you know that would reflect poorly on me and what like if
00:22:22 you just if it if it had hit the goal and then you had just like skip town well
00:22:26 yeah and in a way right that would you want to make sure that the artists were
00:22:33 paid and that was like a big part of yeah yeah yeah yeah and I think it's still
00:22:38 a good thing I think it's just sort of like maybe it was like like what was
00:22:43 would that be like a normal paycheck for the work they do I was that a higher
00:22:47 paycheck I hear that like cuz I'm like in the industry like in the big two I
00:22:54 think three thousand is not like too much I think like people get roughly paid
00:22:59 more than that yeah it in the indie stuff no one's ever paid like three
00:23:05 thousand up front right and I was talking to I was talking to my buddy Eddie
00:23:09 Adams creator of pinky and pepper forever and he was telling me that yeah
00:23:15 straight up like I've never been paid three thousand up front and I'm like okay
00:23:19 well that was kind of high and I mostly picked that number because I was I was
00:23:22 talking to a buddy about joining the anthology before they they couldn't and
00:23:28 I asked him like let's say like I was commissioning you for a comic how much
00:23:32 would you charge for something in between like 15 to 20 pages and they said
00:23:37 three thousand and I was like oh well they want three thousand dollars for a
00:23:41 15 page comic 15 to 20 that's like that's like isn't that like $200 a page you
00:23:50 ever made a comic I mean some people are worth that much I mean when it's like
00:23:55 when you're paid to do something I mean that the thing is like I would probably
00:23:58 multiple pages is a lot of work yeah it's really good art because it can
00:24:03 cost a lot because I'm also asking you to create I'm asking you to create a
00:24:06 original story too right and that's like a whole other thing right I mean yeah I
00:24:13 understand that if you're talking about like in turn like an hourly rate yeah
00:24:18 sure you could easily spend 10 or 20 hours drawing a comic page if you wanted
00:24:25 and then it's like well $200 is like that's $10 an hour it's not that much
00:24:29 and like yeah true but also like you said like no like no indie comic artists
00:24:35 is commanding numbers like that right right yeah yeah it's too high agree but
00:24:41 also a part of me was kind of like seeing it as a gamble because think of it
00:24:45 like this I mean I know it's failed now but let's say there's an alternate
00:24:49 universe where it did succeed right and let's say like the numbers of like how
00:24:55 everyone like paid for it were like just like just like good you know like there
00:24:59 was never like everything like lined up good and everyone got there like 3,000
00:25:04 that would like yeah that would look imagine being the guy who was able to
00:25:09 get people $3,000 right you I mean you would be the guy people you I mean you
00:25:14 would be the guy that people would want to work with right because like oh like
00:25:18 cheesy has gotten people $3,000 before I want to work with that guy right sure
00:25:24 right sure yeah ambitious it isn't it is ambitious and I mean it bit me in the
00:25:30 ass and I bit that I mean here's I guess here's what I think about that it's
00:25:36 like you know obviously in hindsight we can say the goal was too high I think I
00:25:44 think for an all or nothing I think the all or nothing I know that's kind of
00:25:50 just how Kickstarter is but I think I think going for like okay we're gonna
00:25:55 make costs plus $3,000 per artist or or nothing is like kind of a mistake yeah
00:26:04 yeah I agree with that I agree with that yeah luckily for me I never like signed
00:26:10 anything or never told them that like yeah I'm gonna get you the 3,000 with
00:26:15 like one at once you know they're they're still gonna get the 3,000 is
00:26:20 just gonna now gonna take like a year what do you mean they're gonna get the
00:26:24 3,000 there's like so as because I'm gonna be selling the book like the book
00:26:29 could could still be sold how are you how can you how can you guarantee how
00:26:35 can you guarantee that that those those guys will each get $3,000 in sales
00:26:39 residuals because I'm just gonna sell the book you can't what what are you
00:26:49 talking about I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna give the 3,000 at once I mean
00:26:57 sure I mean sure like if you were to say at one point the book like I can't
00:27:04 guarantee that the book will continue to sell and that I reached 3,000 right it's
00:27:08 like what you're saying yeah yeah okay okay I mean I mean to make that to make
00:27:14 that happen I mean I don't know how much you sell them if you sell the book for
00:27:17 $20 then you would have to sell you know to make $6,000 to give these other two
00:27:25 guys 3,000 each you have to sell 300 copies and that's if you had no take
00:27:31 for yourself or to cover your own costs is that where you're I'm well you know
00:27:40 mine I'm also like this is gonna make it I'm just gonna make it seem even more
00:27:48 impossible is that I'm also like getting a cut like it's getting like three ways
00:27:52 you know yes I know I was very conservative in my S right right right
00:27:58 now I get you I think it could be done it just has to be like cuz I have I have
00:28:04 I have plans I have plans and people in places what does that mean I got trust the
00:28:12 plan then where we go one we all then yeah I mean now I mean my language I mean I
00:28:20 respect the the dedication I guess to pay the artists for the work they've
00:28:25 already part of a part of me doesn't want like I hate the idea of like oh you
00:28:30 remember when I promised you guys this much well not anymore it's like well are
00:28:33 you are you so hang on here's here's what are you saying that you told these
00:28:37 guys that you would pay them $3,000 if they drew like a 15 page like a 15 to
00:28:43 20 page comic for this anthology yes why cuz that's what one guy asked for and I
00:28:51 was like oh to make it fair everyone should get that amount I mean I mean make
00:28:55 sense at the time no it didn't I think it did I mean how could you you it had to
00:29:01 make sense at one point for me to agree to it okay hang on okay so you're so
00:29:07 you're saying what I'm saying you're saying that you have an agreement with
00:29:11 this guy that you now owe him $3,000 for this comic that he drew for this
00:29:17 anthology and it will be well both of these guys but okay I mean I'm gonna I'm
00:29:26 gonna be perfectly honest okay if if that's I mean if that's the deal I think
00:29:31 that maybe I think maybe the thing to do is cut and run I think maybe the thing
00:29:36 to do is call it a sunk cost and cut and run I don't think I could I could do
00:29:42 that maybe I could lie I mean I could potentially I mean I'm talking to them so
00:29:46 you owe this so you so you told this guy you get him $3,000 but not but just at
00:29:52 some point in the future well not all at once and like you know segment they're
00:29:57 getting like once all these pre-orders are done they're all getting like you
00:30:00 know they're part in it it's not gonna be three thousand three thousand but
00:30:04 gonna be part of three thousand so you're just gonna owe them money until it
00:30:10 you sell all yeah so it's all paid I guess I would have added a stipulation in
00:30:19 the original agreement but if the Kickstarter doesn't do it you have a
00:30:23 different arrangement ready yeah but I mean there was there's no there was
00:30:29 never an agreement to like that they would get that the green ones that'll
00:30:32 get three thousand and never said like that they that they wouldn't get it in
00:30:38 parts
00:30:41 sure but like there should have been like if the Kickstarter doesn't succeed
00:30:47 you can get like a percentage of the sales of however many we end up selling
00:30:52 boy I thought that's gonna happen that's what's gonna happen with the pre-orders
00:30:57 they're gonna get a percentage of the we're gonna like it's gonna be sweet
00:31:01 three ways but you're not also you're not also owing them like a an ultimate
00:31:08 like some right and I guess that sucks a little hope you get enough orders I mean
00:31:16 I guess in theory well the thing is I'm not I'm not gonna die when the pre-order
00:31:20 deadline is is up you know I'm not gonna like be murdered unless I am and this is
00:31:25 like the last recording of me in okay first I mean three three thousand seems
00:31:29 like a lot in but in in theory I guess if you if you manage to make if you
00:31:36 manage okay how much you planning to sell the books for 30 okay 30 right well
00:31:47 how much okay just how much is how much was like for one book how much is the
00:31:55 cost to print one book and then ship it to someone that orders it just for the
00:32:01 one would be like just yeah just like her book last quote okay so I'm not
00:32:08 ordering in bulk is what you're saying I'm just ordering one well you would all
00:32:13 I am I assume that you are gonna print in bulk the price the price goes down as
00:32:18 you order more I mean but you already know yes yes so okay but you okay but
00:32:24 you're saying that you but you haven't printed them yet so you don't know the
00:32:27 yeah I don't know can you okay can you give me like a rough ballpark I mean I'll
00:32:32 tell you I'll tell you how many pre-orders you got so far sure okay look at
00:32:37 the Google form okay we got four we got no we got 40 pre-orders I remember one
00:32:43 guy canceled and it had to refill up we have 40 orders so far right and if I go
00:32:49 to if I go to my printer and I type in like how much that's gonna be Lincoln
00:32:56 we'll put a link link in the description for anyone that pledged to the
00:32:59 Kickstarter or who wants to get the book by the because it would you have like a
00:33:02 hundred or you have like a hundred and something pledges right to the key to the
00:33:09 Kickstarter we have like I'm gonna check that too I think it was like under
00:33:16 was it okay yeah maybe a hundred bucks no I wouldn't have been that I think it's
00:33:26 a hundred bucks fail it was only a hundred bucks if all my friends is donated
00:33:34 $1 hmm okay I'm gonna I'm getting the quote right now okay no it was 91 90 91
00:33:41 backers so if I look if I order if I order 40 books that's gonna be around
00:33:49 like 264 okay so that's what like I'm so and I'm like I'm like six like six six
00:33:57 dollars a piece to print $5.15 okay and so let's call it $5 and what about
00:34:05 what about shipping what about shipping what's the cost to ship
00:34:07 domestically inside the US I mean it's it's gotta be five bucks five bucks all
00:34:13 right let's okay so let's say 10 let's just say $10 ship printing and shipping
00:34:18 so out of that $30 10 that's $10 goes to cover costs so you got $20 profit
00:34:26 leftover and then splitting it I mean let's let's assume assuming that you
00:34:33 don't take any additional cut other than what covers the cost of printing
00:34:37 that's let's say that's $10 a piece to each of these other guys so so you've
00:34:43 got to sell 300 so 300 copies will make the the 3k that you owe these two guys
00:34:49 and I guess if you could do that then thereafter then thereafter you own the
00:34:54 anthology and you don't have to pay any additional cost you could like continue
00:35:01 to sell it right um a part of me like because the thing is they still own the
00:35:07 rights to their story why they made a story I'm gonna lose my mind you pay
00:35:14 them $3,000 and you don't even get the rights that's just for their work oh my
00:35:21 god I the thing is like no this is under a fucking contract so I don't like pay
00:35:26 them right the fuck away you know I just think it's all really like what's the
00:35:34 word like a verbal cons a verbal contract a verbal verbal agreement yeah and
00:35:43 like I don't have to pay them all at once listen let me let me just let me
00:35:49 ask you okay let's say let's say a year from now a year from now you've sold
00:35:54 300 copies you've paid you've paid each of these guys the 3k that you said you
00:36:00 would pay them for their for their work and then you're like okay cool done I've
00:36:05 paid down I've paid down Tom nook for my house you know my my dad is covered
00:36:10 then the next day you go to a con and you sell some more and you sell some more
00:36:14 copies you sell some more right copies of of clown milk what do you do with the
00:36:18 profits I mean if I haven't like bought the stories off of them I would split
00:36:25 it like three ways with them still that just seems like you're really getting
00:36:32 screwed here sure but I'm not too worried about it because I have my own
00:36:36 comics you should be worried about it you should be worried about getting
00:36:41 screwed I mean okay I'll tell you this if I were to do this all over again I
00:36:55 wouldn't I wouldn't set up these parameters I mean sure right right and
00:37:01 the thing is that like I think the one thing that's not making me freak out is
00:37:05 that there's no deadline for the 3,000 yeah I mean like that's that's good I
00:37:11 mean it depends on how these two that's why I like about about that I mean are
00:37:16 they free if they like freak out I mean none of them have freaked out on me yet
00:37:19 yeah right they're very super chill about it and you know like they both are
00:37:27 very like chill about it and have other ways to make money I don't think they're
00:37:32 worried about like I mean they told me that like they put the fucking what what
00:37:37 what's that crazy shit that people do with their houses like oh yeah mortgage
00:37:43 they put their houses up they flip their house upside down and they're like
00:37:50 she's I put my house upside down to get that 3,000 like down screwed now the bank
00:37:55 is coming after me yeah I just think that like you're you're gonna split the
00:38:01 profits three ways from the pre-orders until all three of you get 3k and then
00:38:10 the profits will if they continue you'll split it three ways as well it just
00:38:16 sort of feels like there is no 3k it's just sort of like the profits will
00:38:20 continue from whatever you sell you just split it three ways that's that's
00:38:24 ultimately like if I keep ever decide to keep selling the book after we reach
00:38:28 the 3k I mean there's no reason why not right I mean the most of what I'm aside
00:38:34 from the labor you have to do to me the fact the fact that you you know agree
00:38:39 there was an agreement with these guys like I will give you 3k to produce a
00:38:44 comic a work of intellectual property I feel like what then is like okay you
00:38:53 paid me to make this thing now you own it because you commissioned me to produce
00:39:00 it for you I have done labor to produce a work that is now your property like
00:39:07 there's no obligation unless you've mentioned in your like verbal agreement
00:39:12 there's no obligation that they get like residuals beyond 3k so you don't have
00:39:20 to I mean a part of it's kind of like what if like what if like the right
00:39:24 push the right person pushes the book at the right time and then it starts
00:39:29 selling gang busters and like after I don't know the 3k right and then what do
00:39:36 you mean then like what if the book just becomes extremely like popular after
00:39:44 you mean like if one of these get if one of these get are you are you saying
00:39:48 that you want these what if the book makes way more money have an incentive to
00:39:53 push the book I mean that could be a way that's the way to like to look at it I
00:39:58 mean mostly because I think like you know I I feel like it's fair that they
00:40:01 keep getting a share you know well I don't I mean I would want people like
00:40:09 cuz the thing is like if there was a way where I mean they just keep getting
00:40:13 like royalties off of it and they get like passive income I think that's great
00:40:18 you know I mean sure but you would need a higher cut because you're also the one
00:40:24 organizing the printing and sending though of them and they just they've drawn
00:40:27 it they don't need to do anything more so like beyond the 3k you should be
00:40:34 getting a higher cut for extra labor in the process of continuing to sell the
00:40:39 books I was originally the Kickstarter because the labor costs was gonna go to
00:40:45 me and me and my partner because we're gonna be the one who was actually gonna
00:40:48 like put the books in the envelopes and like print out the labels and whatnot
00:40:54 right so I was ultimately gonna get like a bigger cut I mean no I mean I get
00:41:03 that I get that I mean like yeah that's a yeah I should be getting a bigger cut
00:41:08 for like sending and shipping it out but I think I'm think right now I want to
00:41:14 like just focus on just getting the the books out and like getting the word out
00:41:22 you know I've like little I've like little things I've like little things to
00:41:27 kind of like I guess the idea is to like because you know I've done like
00:41:31 pre-orders before and when you do like a pre-order for the same book again in a
00:41:35 couple of months you usually don't sell too much like you did in the first run
00:41:39 right yeah so like I have um I have little little ideas little plans in
00:41:47 place to um to keep some momentum going you know okay I mean I could I could see
00:41:57 like if you table that a con or something I could see selling selling some
00:42:01 copies at a table I do have I do have like I do have a con lined up like okay
00:42:06 yeah there's there's a con that's gonna happen where like I could sell the book
00:42:10 at so yeah that's a that's a that's in mind I think I'm just not too worried
00:42:18 about the one thing that's making me not worried about like the 3000 and why I
00:42:25 don't really I'm not that freaked out about it is because ultimately there's
00:42:27 like no deadline right I understand that right as long as like I mean up with me
00:42:34 as I feel as long as they're getting the the money in a reasonable amount and
00:42:38 in a reasonable like you know yeah an amount like over a course of time then
00:42:44 it's not it's not like too worrying you know I wouldn't want like oh by 20 by
00:42:50 20 30 finally they all got in the 3k you know I wouldn't want that but like you
00:42:57 know I feel I feel like it could be possible by next year I feel like it
00:43:02 could be like I really do have that much faith they buy next year they will all
00:43:06 get their money that was originally promise what if what if what if you what
00:43:13 if you just don't what if you just don't sell that many books I mean I'll just
00:43:18 find other ways to pay them my pocket see yeah here's this is like this is like
00:43:25 you're like you're the one shouldering all the risk I mean I hate in this in
00:43:29 this situation you're the you're the one shouldering if I mean they've received a
00:43:34 promise of financial compensation you're the one who is running the risk of what
00:43:39 if I have to pay out of pocket if like sales don't cover the cost that's why I
00:43:42 feel like it's fair for you like once the fee is paid you own the rights that's
00:43:48 the risk versus reward calculus I mean that could be an agreement I
00:43:52 talked to them about well no it's too late
00:44:00 nothing nothing in stone it's always like just what do you mean there's
00:44:05 nothing in stone I'm gonna I'm gonna throw myself on a fucking way for the 3k
00:44:09 nothing's like in stone what what what do you mean a side of the 3k that's
00:44:14 that's the whole deal I don't get why you're mad I'm the one who's gonna get
00:44:20 anything why are you mad I'm the one who's got to pay them 3k I each I just
00:44:28 don't understand I just don't understand okay well I just don't understand
00:44:34 what's going on here and it makes me angry when I don't understand things all
00:44:37 okay all right well I I just I just I just okay I guess on the one hand they
00:44:45 do they do they do they do run the risk of like okay this guy wants me to draw a
00:44:49 comic I'm drawing this comic with an agreement of future payment and there's
00:44:53 a chance that this guy will never come through and I will not ever be paid for
00:44:57 it that is that is a risk so on their end on your end if if you are if you are
00:45:04 committed to falling through and paying the 3k that was agreed to then then the
00:45:07 risk is is all on you like what if what if the book doesn't sell and I have to
00:45:12 cover it myself so on that end it's like well there's there should be some
00:45:17 reward on your end for for risking that I agree with that I agree with that I
00:45:23 mean I'll talk I mean that's a good that's fair point I'll bring that out
00:45:26 but I'm just saying at this point at this point it seems too late to call it
00:45:31 like if you if you said hey man what are they go galactic be and who's the other
00:45:35 one super spell super so on galactic be if you if you call them up you bring them
00:45:40 up on the telephone you say hey galactic be so I know I said that there was a
00:45:50 through there was an agreement of $3,000 in exchange for work you have done the
00:45:56 work now I owe you the $3,000 now hey what if instead of you can what if instead
00:46:03 of you continuing to receive residuals what if instead of that we didn't do
00:46:10 that I don't know like what what what are there what are their expectations do
00:46:15 they have expectations do they know what's going on yeah they know what's
00:46:20 going on okay do I mean do they do they expect to continue to receive
00:46:26 residuals into the indefinite future no I haven't told them that part exactly I
00:46:34 mean I'll say that much I'm told that part okay so they don't expect anything
00:46:40 in in addition to the 3k so why would you give them any more than that I mean I
00:46:49 think I just I mean nice person yeah I mean nice person shut the fuck I'm just
00:47:00 it's I mean I don't know there's being a nice person and then there's just and
00:47:06 then there's just shooting yourself in the foot I don't know I just I just feel
00:47:09 like there's no you know this is a this is a business arrangement that you
00:47:13 entered into here and so I feel like it's it's everyone everyone it's kind of
00:47:20 everyone's individual responsibility to max to max to maximize their own profit
00:47:25 and if you're do if you and if you're like well okay the expectation was that
00:47:29 I would only pay them $3,000 but I can meet that and then I can choose to
00:47:33 exceed that if I want to I mean that's just charity I just paying for the cut
00:47:40 like you know for like you know no the three thousand was their cut no the
00:47:45 agreed the agreed upon 3k was their cut you'd be paying extra money anything in
00:47:49 addition to that is literally just you giving the money for free that's
00:47:53 royalties no it's not royalties royalties are agreed upon no royalties
00:47:59 would be a royalty agreement would be I won't pay you anything upfront but if you
00:48:04 make this if you make this work and I publish it in this book I will continue
00:48:08 to give you a cut of future sales into the indefinite future that's royalties
00:48:14 yeah you could you could pay them a fine and then they get also royalties like
00:48:17 that's why option cheesy I here's it here's I just feel like we're approaching
00:48:22 this I okay I think I understand okay that you value the idea of paying these
00:48:31 guys more right and that's and that's admirable okay I understand you I
00:48:36 understand the appeal of that however I just think you should be focused on like
00:48:43 your own bottom line first here and I really think that yeah I really think
00:48:47 that you have a reasonable expectation that like these proceeds should belong to
00:48:52 you and and I don't understand why you seem to want to be rid of them I I guess
00:49:00 cuz like I mentioned before there's no like that line to it and I would
00:49:08 understand okay I would be mad if I would I would probably be very upset with
00:49:14 myself if this was if my Twitter like handle wasn't like working on like five
00:49:21 other if I didn't have other projects to like that like that's not that's not
00:49:26 about your overall thing it's not what I'm talking about the agreement you made
00:49:30 did not include royalties so you have no obligation to do that that's what I'm
00:49:38 saying that's what I'm saying it sounds yeah there's no obligation for such a
00:49:42 thing okay I mean I guess it just wouldn't kill me to do royalties it
00:49:48 wouldn't like end my life this is so I I don't I don't get it yeah I mean by
00:50:01 that logic I mean anything you make in excess of like what you need to like pay
00:50:08 rent and buy food it's like well it wouldn't kill me to just you know give
00:50:14 it to someone give it to whoever I what I give help please I think ultimately
00:50:37 the goodwill I get off of that's gonna be more valuable to me I don't know all
00:50:44 right I'll tell you what okay here's what I think I think I'll just I'll just I'll
00:50:56 I think if I'm if I'm one of these guys and I'm like I agreed to do this work in
00:51:03 exchange for $3,000 to be paid in the indefinite future and then maybe a year
00:51:07 or whatever from now I received the $3,000 I'm like yes and then and then the
00:51:15 guy who gave me the $3,000 like hey by the way I'm gonna give you even more I'm
00:51:19 just gonna keep giving you even more than that like it's like I don't know to me
00:51:25 that doesn't earn you any goodwill that just makes you look like a sucker like
00:51:30 you wouldn't you wouldn't what do you I would I would appreciate I would
00:51:35 appreciate the money and I would shake my head and think what a sap why is this
00:51:39 guy still paying me I'll mean I'll take it but I don't respect it that's just me
00:51:47 though you don't you don't think so yeah do you feel that would you think I'm
00:51:52 as if I kept giving you money after like a comic like would you would you think
00:51:56 I'm sort of fucking sad I don't know if I 100% I think I think when it comes to
00:52:02 like respect and goodwill honoring an agreement is like that's good yeah like
00:52:08 if you eventually get these people the 3k they should be happy with you honoring
00:52:14 your the agreement you had extra money is just sort of like oh cool like I
00:52:21 wouldn't really I don't know whether it would be like oh my god she's so
00:52:26 cool yeah you are giving me free money but like I think on some level I repeat
00:52:35 work would feel more right like oh cheesy follows through on promises they get
00:52:42 you the money they promise you so I'll work for them again the extra money I
00:52:48 don't think is like a necessary part of that it maybe it's nice maybe maybe if
00:52:55 there was like if a network executive calls you up on the phone one day he's
00:52:59 choppy cigar and he says hey I got to get this cheesy manfredo guy on the
00:53:03 phone we got to make a clown milk Netflix adaptation we got to get him if
00:53:07 that if that happens then and you make a million dollars and you receive a
00:53:12 residual you and you receive a million dollars in your bank account then I
00:53:15 could maybe be like you call up these guys and you're like hey guys I just got
00:53:19 like a huge windfall from this work and like as a token of goodwill I'm gonna
00:53:23 give you each like ten thousand dollars or something here you go God bless like
00:53:28 something like that I think would be understandable I just I just wouldn't
00:53:36 feel good about you like selling yourself short in a sense I feel yeah I
00:53:42 feel like you're selling yourself you should you should like if it's not in
00:53:48 the agreement like you don't you shouldn't feel the need to do extra yeah
00:53:53 just do what you said you did you would do and that that should be enough that
00:53:58 will be enough well I I mean it wasn't kind of the whole goal with the
00:54:05 three thousand dollars didn't you want to give yourself like three months to take
00:54:09 off of work so that you could just draw instead of working right right so yeah
00:54:17 I mean there you go money is time so you should you should you should you should
00:54:26 you should want to hoard as much of it as you can to use on doing the things you
00:54:30 want to go that's it I don't say I'm not like I'm just not freaked out about it
00:54:38 it doesn't I don't know because ultimately I mean these guys are like my
00:54:43 friends too and if I could like I understand like do you would you not
00:54:47 want your friends to have more money like I don't like if they thought well sure
00:54:53 I will share I want my friends to have more money but I'm not digging into my
00:54:56 pockets to like shovel it out to them but I don't want them to have more money
00:55:00 more than I want to have money myself I mean we can I mean the thing is that it's
00:55:07 all just like still for one I could talk to them about it right because like
00:55:11 there's some things in this conversation that are making me rethink some some
00:55:15 approaches about it right okay okay that being said it's not the worst shit ever
00:55:23 you know that it's not the worst shit I just talking about I think that it's not
00:55:29 it's what are you talking about I'm not like very like very least the barest
00:55:34 minimum is that beyond the 3k you definitely get a higher cut if you
00:55:40 continue to pay them like you get I don't know half of it and then well wait
00:55:46 how'd you split it this three I don't know I can't know I can't numbers but
00:55:50 you do it more so that you're getting more out of it after the 3k that you've
00:55:54 promised them because it's you didn't promise them anymore and if you want to
00:55:58 give them something that's you know you are in with it within your rights to do
00:56:04 so it's just you're the one doing the extra work by continuing to go to the
00:56:09 printer and print them mail them out so like the very least you need a higher cut
00:56:14 I think it I think that's get give you know what you're you're you're
00:56:19 negotiating with the terrorists right now you're giving you're giving too much
00:56:24 I really think so give what you there's no like you did you did a chapter you
00:56:31 did a vaporette for Vapor 2 if I go to if I go to a con and I sell I don't know
00:56:36 20 copies of Vapor 2 I'm not I'm sorry I'm not I'm not giving you any of that
00:56:41 I already paid you sure yeah that's that's your prerogative yeah yeah that's
00:56:48 your prerogative right but think of it like that's fucking right it's like
00:56:52 fucking prerogative think of it like this think of it like okay but like let's
00:56:55 say um I don't know let's say um you're you're you're you're you're an artist
00:57:00 right and then uh then Ben saying approaches you for a vaporette and I
00:57:04 call I duck under my table I call the police yeah let's say let's say it's
00:57:09 like oh you want to you do a vaporette but then let's say cheesy Manfredo comes
00:57:14 in and is like oh you want to do you want to do a clown milk story ultimately
00:57:19 which which job are they gonna take which one seems like you're gonna pay me
00:57:22 more well here's the thing right even though you may if you do the residuals
00:57:29 thing you may have like a history of going beyond the agreed upon amount of
00:57:34 money that doesn't necessarily mean that every time a great an agreement is
00:57:38 made you're going to go beyond I mean like let's say like I would say there's
00:57:42 a good one the agreement to be like you know the amount I expect let's say
00:57:47 maybe hope yeah I could hope that you would give me like residuals even though
00:57:52 you didn't say you would but like that wouldn't really influence my future
00:57:56 decision-making on who I would like to be working for when it should go back
00:58:01 to the company that keeps paying you more well only if it yeah but like there's
00:58:06 no guarantee like if it's not in the agreement if you if it's in the agreement
00:58:10 that you give residuals beyond a paid thing then I'm like oh that sounds like
00:58:16 a better deal the only thing in this situation is that the agreement didn't
00:58:20 involve that and you're doing it anyway yeah so so like as a as a as a decision
00:58:32 making factor if I see the agreement like say both of you have identical
00:58:38 agreements for a number of pages and a payout and cheesy may like is likely to
00:58:46 or potentially could give me extra money on top of that I just I don't know I
00:58:52 don't think I would like that would sway my opinion yeah you don't think so I
00:58:57 think I just I like things in writing I like things to know exactly what I'm
00:59:03 getting myself in for I to me it seems like oh this oh this cheesy manfredo
00:59:09 guy he just gives free money over and above well he's he's gonna he's gonna
00:59:17 go bankrupt his business is gonna go under he's gonna he's not he's never
00:59:21 gonna make it in this town he's NG yet he's NGMI because he's sucker not I
00:59:33 want to work for this guy because he pays more this guy's this guy's sunk
00:59:36 because he he can't because he because he's just bleeding money I know that's
00:59:43 nice to be nice to your friends but like in a business arrangement it's it's a
00:59:47 little different I mean I'll tell you I mean I mean most like the most I could
00:59:51 tell you is that I'll continue to talk to these guys and we'll arrange some
00:59:55 arrangements like I'll tell you that much right what what what arrangements oh my
01:00:01 well I will fucking like what we'll talk about like how residuals will work you
01:00:09 know like I got there are but okay but there is no expectation I have to I mean
01:00:15 yeah but there could be but why would you want there to be like I like I want
01:00:23 them to keep getting paid like what's what's wrong with that like I don't
01:00:28 fucking I there's I can't I can't do it there's just no there's that we've made
01:00:32 no progress we've made no progress here I I mean I don't I don't I don't want to
01:00:38 tell you I mean I'll talk to these guys and that's between me and these two
01:00:41 other guys right I don't have to expel every single little thing I agree with
01:00:46 these guys on this podcast unless I have to unless you were expecting me that
01:00:51 like to go for every little fucking little what give help give help you
01:00:59 already you already said it was like a verbal agreement yeah right and then
01:01:03 there's no deadline yeah exactly um that's why I'm not fucking worried if it
01:01:08 seemed if it seems like it was fucking ruining me yeah I'll talk to them I'll
01:01:11 rearrange things but it's not ruining me well of course it's not really cuz you
01:01:16 haven't given you haven't paid them anything yeah what's going on I don't
01:01:24 tell you even even if I like I don't know I even think I don't know I don't
01:01:30 tell you I been seen breaks down on the idea of not looking out for number one
01:01:41 but fucking fucking Ben sell Ben sell break seeds at the idea of your cheesy
01:01:50 your NGMI okay I'm sorry be your NGMI okay that's that's that's that's that's
01:01:54 my takeaway okay well I'll I'll end GMI here let me right I have no I mean I
01:02:04 have no I have no power to compel you to do any anything I don't know yeah that's
01:02:16 nothing more to say at this point I think it was a little bit of a sloppy
01:02:20 initial promise that relied on and it's like it's causing problems down the line
01:02:27 but if you're not worried about it then I guess we can just move on a different
01:02:32 topic yeah I'm not worried about it I mean in retrospect get the fucking
01:02:37 Kickstarter work as a pretty decent advertising for the pre-order it's
01:02:41 right yeah everyone loves everyone loves a comeback I'll tell you that much you
01:02:49 know and that's so that's that's the first thing on my list of what I did
01:02:54 wrong wait I have to pee I'll be right back I want to hear I do want to hear
01:03:00 the rest of this but I gotta pee I also gotta pee I'll be back all right okay I'm
01:03:06 back yeah what's what's up gamers are you sound excited just to hear from me all
01:03:16 right are we on to item number two give us not back yet oh where'd she go she
01:03:22 want to go she went to the where they call it there she went to the Lou oh she
01:03:31 went to the short to the crapper good I guess okay how can I take this only take
01:03:44 this opportunity how can I get through plot plot plot twist turns out big Twitter
01:03:47 artist guy too nice too nice for this world
01:03:52 and back yeah all right all right all right let's let's all right number item
01:03:58 number two let's go let's go I should have done way more promotion for the
01:04:02 comic okay okay yeah sure yeah like a lot of stuff could be um like could have
01:04:09 been a lot of stuff that I did later down the line I should have probably done
01:04:13 earlier the whole you mean like the the clown girl ads and stuff oh well I mean
01:04:19 here's the thing that maybe that probably wasn't the best thing for me to do
01:04:22 because um why cuz I cuz like okay so on paper like oh I have like a clown
01:04:30 milk like a porn comic I have a clown porn comic right I have that yeah who
01:04:36 do I get to promote this well oh there's clown girls out there that have only
01:04:41 fans I get them to promote yes right that seems to make sense on paper right
01:04:47 cuz they both have clown in the word right but the one thing that I kind of
01:04:51 noticed is that like every time one of these clown girls would make a post like
01:04:56 the pledges never seemed to jump like I didn't seem to get more pledges after
01:05:00 their posts right and that could be like okay it could be like one maybe it just
01:05:06 wasn't enough clown girls maybe I should have gone with a couple more right maybe
01:05:10 five because that's kind of like the thing with advertising you gotta see
01:05:13 something at least five times before you like give it a chance right that's that
01:05:19 a thing that's what I heard that it's gotta be at least five times get seen at
01:05:22 five times before you really consider giving it a chance okay like you know
01:05:26 before it breaks you down right or two makes make sense the people that kind of
01:05:31 like drawn like clown porn aren't the same kind of people who want like IRL
01:05:37 clown porn you know yeah maybe yeah that's cuz it could be a disconnect there
01:05:43 too right and even though like there's like a klusi means a bound doesn't mean
01:05:52 that like necessarily it's popular it could just be um what's the word for it
01:05:57 when something seems more popular than actually is
01:06:01 I'm not sure but yeah basically so the fact that a paper tiger clown paper tiger
01:06:12 like like like mate because I remember like a couple podcasts ago you mentioned
01:06:19 something about it seems like the clown real stuff is popular right now but I
01:06:24 could just because I follow cheesy man Fredo and he's the one mostly retweeting
01:06:28 right yeah it could just be that you're just following me and it seems like it
01:06:33 right it could have been I feel like there was that that ace attorney character
01:06:39 that just blew up and I saw everywhere mm-hmm yeah yes yeah it could be it could
01:06:46 be it could be that or it just could be that maybe these people just didn't make
01:06:50 maybe seem like the major the people just didn't like gel well with like my art
01:06:55 style I know like I had someone tell me that they didn't they didn't like my
01:07:00 art style for when it comes to porn so that that could be a more common take
01:07:05 with a lot of people I mean that's why there's like different artists on the
01:07:08 project right not not much you can not much you can really do about that right
01:07:12 you know let's say I get better at drawing porn but easier not not easier
01:07:19 done but that takes while before you know so so what's the takeaway if you did
01:07:26 it again would you not do any clown girl ads would you more clown girl I think
01:07:30 what I what I what I notice is that because later in the middle of the
01:07:34 Kickstarter I had the idea of like there was like a handful of people there was
01:07:40 two there was two like NSFW artists who I talked to about making like like if you
01:07:48 could draw a piece of art that promotes the Kickstarter I will just send you a
01:07:51 free copy of the book right and I noticed that when they drew their pictures
01:07:57 there was like a boost in pledges right which makes me think that it's the
01:08:03 audience that like enjoys like cartoon porn is more close to what I'm hitting
01:08:08 than the audience that enjoys like IRL clowns right yes yes so I probably make
01:08:15 sense to me yeah I probably would have gone more that route I would have probably
01:08:19 talked to way more like NSFW artists about doing promotion for it right yeah
01:08:25 yeah like maybe like maybe at least like 10 figures some sort of deal out with
01:08:32 right I think I feel like maybe this got discussed in my discord at some point
01:08:37 but like if you had maybe yeah done like instead of instead of IRL like only
01:08:44 fans girls if you had gotten like NSFW artists to draw like pieces for the
01:08:48 comic and like you could put them in the comic but you could also they could
01:08:53 also serve as like ads right now that makes yeah that makes sense right so
01:09:00 because yeah I mean it's it's a little like weird intricacies of marketing you
01:09:05 know like I mean like you know oh they both say clowns there must be an
01:09:10 overlap like oh well potentially like not really maybe right mm-hmm yeah yeah
01:09:16 that's I mean that yeah next time just do way more promotion or like really
01:09:22 think about who who's the kind of person who's consuming this right like you
01:09:27 know cuz I think only a handful of people that are like fans of my porn
01:09:33 stuff are like very clown centric and the majority are just kind of like oh I
01:09:38 like seeing drawn just humorous just humorous right exactly that's fair like
01:09:43 cartoon right but you target the coomer market the coomer market is bigger
01:09:47 than the clown market because the classy mark that's true so you are not so if
01:09:53 yeah it's reasonable okay okay that's yeah you got an item number three okay
01:10:00 I remember three is probably should have gone with more special rewards right yeah
01:10:10 I'm gonna kill you about the reward no that's not true I had some I thought the
01:10:17 rewards were a little weird yeah they were I thought that I thought that the
01:10:20 Commission tier was very strange I mean I the only reason why I set up the
01:10:24 Commission's like that because I asked like these guys how many commissions are
01:10:27 you willing to do for the Kickstarter yes I understand right this number should
01:10:32 have been zero because it doesn't make any sense what about it doesn't make any
01:10:36 sense well I mean if someone wants a commission they can just they can just
01:10:42 commission them to draw something yeah instead of instead of what does it have
01:10:45 to do with the Kickstarter right exactly what is yeah what it was after
01:10:48 the Kickstarter so what you're saying is okay the Commission should have been
01:10:53 lower no there should not there should not have been a Commission tier it's a
01:10:58 nonsensical tier like if it was lower that incentivizes you to like want a
01:11:04 commission out of here I mean it should have been I can't I can't believe how
01:11:08 much you're misunderstanding what I'm saying right now like the idea of rewards
01:11:13 is that you add value to the product that already exists and you charge higher
01:11:20 than the work you need to put into it so that you actually like make money off of
01:11:25 it mm-hmm so like a signature doesn't take really any work at all and it can add
01:11:32 value like and it can make like individual pledges a lot more an entire
01:11:40 commission is like work that costs a lot yeah that's yeah that's the thing it's
01:11:45 work it's like it's it's like it's additional work for the artist on top of
01:11:51 what was already done to make the product and so if it's like a bad it's like a
01:11:56 bad value proposition for for you the person behind the Kickstarter yeah
01:12:01 because you can't charge the whole price of an entire commission on top of all
01:12:06 of that because it then it might get too high for people to actually want to
01:12:09 pledge so you'd have to make it like a cheaper alternative but then the work
01:12:13 still needs to be done so you're losing money ultimately
01:12:18 mm all right I hear you that's why on the Lord of Ghost thing I would do I would
01:12:25 do doodles but they they're not like supposed to be good they're just sort of
01:12:28 a little asset they're not take too much time out of you right yeah I've heard of
01:12:32 I heard a very similar thing I just I guess in my head it was like oh you know
01:12:36 it's better than a doodle commission right and then it made sense then but now it
01:12:43 I mean from the point of view of you in this position of like I need to make this
01:12:49 Kickstarter hit its funding goal it does make sense right to offer to offer the
01:12:55 work of these to offer commissions from these other guys as as rewards as a way
01:13:00 to like artificially boost the number but I mean but like to me that's that's
01:13:07 what that is I'm bullying you cheesy I'm bullying you all right okay
01:13:15 why is too nice cheesy I like that about you it's nice definitely 100%
01:13:23 yeah so yeah that that's what I'm saying I from that angle I understand the desire to
01:13:30 do that understand the the the purpose of it but uh yeah um that's all I want is
01:13:38 understanding I just want people to understand where I was coming from you
01:13:41 know I don't want to be a thing I'm in a way I do in a way I do um but uh yeah I
01:13:46 think like kind of the point of the Kickstarter is that you've already done
01:13:51 the work and you are selling it now and you don't and you don't want you don't
01:13:57 really want uh reward tiers that incur a lot of additional work for yourself so you want to do
01:14:02 things yeah think things like paper crafts bookmarks posters stuff that stuff that you
01:14:08 can mass produce and include in the package you can put lipstick on and kiss each book or something
01:14:16 right I um but um there was one tier in the in the rewards I don't know if you saw it and I
01:14:24 mean I didn't really talk about it much was that one of the tiers was getting a video from pasta
01:14:28 the clown and he'll monologue whatever you want I did I did see that it's it's an interesting idea
01:14:35 it's kind of got the same problem as a commission in that it sort of involves the whole separate
01:14:39 production it the the the thing is that like um it's actually not that hard to think I mean yeah
01:14:46 you could you could mass produce that would not be like do all the makeup and set up the camera
01:14:51 but then you can do all of them at once right and yeah exactly yeah boom boom boom right right
01:14:56 after right so it's not that hard actually and I and I like and I love I I'm talking I love I gave
01:15:02 me an excuse to put on the makeup please well fair enough but did anyone go for that tier uh no I
01:15:09 didn't really talk about it I guess I didn't really talk about it because like I felt I felt I felt
01:15:14 sad I did you felt sad I felt sad why why did you feel sad because the Kickstarter was failing
01:15:21 that's okay but um sure um yeah I mean like I probably could have like lowered that tier
01:15:29 I want um here's the thing I oh I was like 200 okay um I think also I mean someone like mentioned
01:15:39 I saw one comment like in one of the videos a couple of videos ago where someone said that
01:15:44 she's gonna have enough of the reward between like the the physical book to like a commission
01:15:51 yeah new new made a comment yeah yeah and and a part of me like is like well I mean a I wanted
01:15:59 things to be simple and in retrospect that it's like shooting myself in the foot and I get that
01:16:04 but but then B is like a part of me is very much like I don't like doing that like I don't like
01:16:11 I don't really like fuck with like buttons or like or like kind of like making stickers and
01:16:18 shit like that you know and like uh I get it I get that it's a hassle but I I do think that's
01:16:26 like that probably would have helped me right yeah a little little like stuff like stuff like that is
01:16:32 stuff like that is I is good I mean I mean I got I got to thinking and tell me if tell me if you
01:16:38 agree with this um that like the people that when you do that you're I mean you're like you're adding
01:16:43 more value to the thing right yeah right because like well the thing is people don't and you and
01:16:49 you do that because like you know people don't value you too much right or like what wait hold
01:16:58 what do you add you add the extra value because you need it right uh sure I I guess right because
01:17:06 that that implies that they that they don't value you too much right because if you need to add the
01:17:11 extra value they don't value you I think it's just a little extra because like like people did buy
01:17:17 my comic without the pen because it's like they wanted the comic I mean people got like my comic
01:17:24 without the um it's it's it's not necessary it's just like you can you can you can I um
01:17:32 like the pins very cheap to mass produce they don't actually add as much value as I charge for them
01:17:40 so they're like they're like a very easy simple little way to like make a lot of profit out of
01:17:48 out of a little thing and it's I I feel like I feel like it's like um every person that comes to the
01:17:57 campaign who is interested in getting whatever the product is they've probably they've probably
01:18:04 got sort of like a soft limit for like how much they're willing to spend on this thing and stuff like
01:18:11 you know uh posters uh bookmarks pins you know little bonus value editions are basic are basically
01:18:20 they're basically just an excuse for them to like justify spending as much as they want to spend
01:18:26 on this thing yeah right like it has to be in small enough increments if you go from like 10
01:18:33 to 50 to 200 then like people are not the people who could who would be willing to spend 35
01:18:40 would just spend 10 because they don't want to spend the whole 50 you know
01:18:45 right yeah like you like you want you want like at the $20 tier for someone who just wants the
01:18:51 book and they've only got $20 to spend but for someone who's got 50 bucks that they're willing
01:18:55 to spend you want yeah if you don't have the $50 tier then they're gonna go for the $25 instead of
01:19:03 the $100 so you've missed out on the whatever they're low-key excuses but like um they're
01:19:13 they can be nice i think my little ghost pin is really cute
01:19:17 they're they're i mean they're excuses but i mean they it's they're not i mean they're they're um
01:19:25 like the pin is not i don't know how much how much extra did it cost to get the pin from the
01:19:32 lord of ghost kickstarter like 10 extra bucks or something like that like i can't remember i it was
01:19:37 really low to to have like 100 or 200 something pins sent to me it was it was yeah probably around 10
01:19:46 10 pounds 10 pounds uh right but i mean i think people know people understand that like this pin
01:19:55 was not did not an individual pin does not cost like the 10 pounds to reduce they're not really
01:20:00 getting like 10 pounds worth of hard value from it but it's the fact that it's associated with this
01:20:05 like exclusive timed event yeah and also the whole thing of like technically anybody could go to
01:20:11 like a pin manufacturer and get whatever pin they want but like it's a big hassle to do that and
01:20:16 if they just receive a little funny thing with their thing they buy and it's like ah cool there's
01:20:23 the the value of the exclusivity of the item there's the value of the fact that you're just
01:20:28 they're just supporting an artist that they like is yeah yeah so even though you might not fuck with
01:20:34 bookmarks uh it doesn't hurt to add them right it's got there's gotta be a way for me to circumvent
01:20:40 books it's gotta be a way i mean i am anti bookmark i like all the bookmarks what's what else i mean
01:20:47 what else was there something else you would you would do instead um fidget spinner um i would
01:20:53 i would um and i would say maybe at $50 you get a music stand with your copy of clown milk like
01:21:00 i'll send you it a music stand yeah yeah music stand like where you know where you put the sheet
01:21:06 music on isn't that like a big bulky thing am i having a stroke wait wait hold on wait i'm not done
01:21:12 so you get the music stand right and you put the book there making it easier to masturbate to the
01:21:17 while you're reading and that's a funny idea but that okay like buying music stands it was a joke
01:21:24 it was a joke i'm not it was a joke i'm not gonna fucking do that what the fuck are you crazy you
01:21:27 think i want to get a motherfucker music stand you insane you think i'm crazy you think i'm making
01:21:33 insane decisions you've lost it you've lost it you've lost the plot you think this is a psycho
01:21:39 you think i think you're a little bit of a jester you think you think i'm a funny little guy you
01:21:44 think i you think i'll pull a little clown maneuver like that maybe should i just should have
01:21:50 done the music stand tier like higher you should get like a at 300 you get the music stand you
01:21:56 should call it like a masturbation a masturbation yeah yeah yeah if that's the point or you could
01:22:03 you could have like a special tear where you cram the comic into a tiny car a tiny clown car and
01:22:09 send that and then you open it up and this like all crumpled and ruined but it's inside a clown
01:22:15 car so it's funny if the if the if the if the uh the campaign hits a hundred thousand dollars we
01:22:21 will invest in a clown car that will go door to door across the country and stop at every
01:22:26 individual backer's house and uh clowns will will pile out of the tiny car deliver their order yeah
01:22:36 i think it i think it could work fuck it we'll go we'll go we'll go um international too and
01:22:43 then someone orders a copy in ukraine you gotta take the clown car all the way in ukraine
01:22:50 is there a big red target on the fucking map okay so item number three is more more tears
01:22:58 more moichindizing i am moichindized yeah yeah is there is there a fourth is there an item number
01:23:04 four um i'm looking at what i listed as um potential items number four uh they're not like
01:23:13 they're not like major issues just kind of grievances or things or me retrospective grievance
01:23:18 persons yeah i have some i do have some grievances against people like cuz um okay let let let just
01:23:24 say i'd like to say a handful of people i realized like didn't really have my fucking back on this
01:23:29 like it worked me right me um he's talking about me i'm i mean i'm i'm down to say the names i just
01:23:36 need ellis are to like bleep them out cuz uh yeah please bleep every single one tell us who didn't
01:23:42 tell us you didn't have i was uh ellis are i'll give you i'll Venmo your 10 bucks if you bleep
01:23:48 all the names you don't need to venmo and he'll it'll just do it why yeah for fuck's sake
01:23:52 he's ellis ellis ellis ellis are ellis are gonna cut himself in the middle of this thing like oh
01:23:58 jeez you you can say you can send me the 10 bucks jeez it's okay you can send me the 10 bucks it's
01:24:02 fine so are you gonna tell us you're gonna give us the names or what uh like okay so like um i've
01:24:10 probably mentioned this before but fucking uh i ghosted me there this whole thing like um because
01:24:17 um so basically he has he has a podcast right and it's it's doing pretty good actually he's doing
01:24:24 like pretty good in numbers and it's a really good podcast like i've never considered being a
01:24:29 patron of a podcast until this podcast now mm-hmm right uh their podcast which is a really good
01:24:36 podcast and um they he and they have mentioned me on the podcast before like casually like almost
01:24:42 every other episode they just casually mentioned me right so i i dm them saying about like it's
01:24:48 basically the whole proposition of like if you guys could just promote um clown milk i will send
01:24:54 both of you guys like a free copy right okay and he just didn't reply back to that email right
01:25:02 yeah and then and then um i um i dm them on like uh twitter like a week later
01:25:10 right and about like hey did you get my email and he's all like oh we got a lot of emails um
01:25:15 well which one was yours and i i reiterated the offer to him and he just didn't he just didn't
01:25:20 say anything to it right yeah and then like then like another week later i tell him like look dude
01:25:27 the kickstart is not doing so well can you at least like retweet it and he he just didn't reply to
01:25:32 that and i i don't know why i don't know why and i mean this might just be a paranoid but it feels
01:25:39 like they're not like casually like mentioning me anymore on the podcast right uh and i i i don't
01:25:47 sound like they just this is not a not a good value proposition for them i mean if he if he told me
01:25:53 that if like because i didn't i mean i did offer him money like do you want do you think you need
01:25:58 to get paid for this because like i'll be down just like you know maybe buy some number because i
01:26:03 told him that like that that i could pay him um but like he just i guess they just were interested
01:26:10 i mean um if i were to kind of like guess why is because um they're about to shoot their own
01:26:17 patreon and i guess they didn't like want to ask their fans for money for another thing
01:26:22 and then they're gonna drop their patreon you know yeah kind of kind of makes sense
01:26:30 i could i could explain it i yeah or i mean another thing that could have explained it was
01:26:36 then maybe someone else like has um tried a proposition to him about like promoting something
01:26:42 and he said no to that and to be consistent he has to say no to me maybe maybe it just feels so it
01:26:50 just feels just so it just feels so weird like i don't know why because he's promoted my other
01:26:56 stuff before like i've asked him like it because this wasn't this isn't like the first time i ever
01:27:00 asked him to like can you retweet like a thing for me right so in this case like i just don't
01:27:06 know what the deal was and it's not like he is not like he's he's not the kind of person that's
01:27:10 scared to retweet porn because like he's like commissioned porn artist and he's posted it on
01:27:15 his like twitter right so it doesn't like i don't know it doesn't like um it doesn't like
01:27:24 make sense you know and it i don't really yeah it's hard hard to hard to say hard to say and
01:27:32 i'm not gonna lie because like i thought i was like decently close to this guy you know and i
01:27:37 was really bothered by it like like no joke i wouldn't like stop thinking about like what
01:27:41 was the deal like why like like like you think you think you got you think someone's got your back
01:27:47 and then it's like i don't know that sucks i mean i guess i guess you you were just i don't know
01:27:56 asking for more than he was willing to give you i guess i mean if he told me that i wish he would
01:28:01 just told if that was the case i wish he would have just told that they're like hey yeah i don't
01:28:06 know is he uncomfortable the thing is i've mentioned clown porn to him before and he's like oh let me
01:28:10 see that i'm sure i'm sure he's not i'm sure he's not like has an issue with clown porn i'm sure
01:28:16 that's not it i i just don't know i just don't know what the what the deal is you know i and i wish i
01:28:24 knew i wish he would have told me right because i because it's not the first time i just been
01:28:28 ghosted by someone and it's not like he unfollowed me on on twitter any like he so follows me but
01:28:33 it's just so like well what what is it like am i do i just pretend that this didn't happen the next
01:28:38 time i you probably there is going to be a next time i would say the Kickstarter was going to fail
01:28:44 like i give help i i don't know i mean i guess there's the there's technically room from just
01:28:56 have not noticed every single time that that could be it yeah you should mention it to him at least
01:29:03 so you know for sure if you want to talk to him again about it i mean i mentioned like probably
01:29:09 like i feel like i'll mention it when i'm in a better headspace about it i think because right
01:29:14 now i think you should probably assume that he did see it and just didn't feel like it and then
01:29:20 i'll just i don't know part of me just feels kind of weird pretending it didn't happen you know
01:29:26 i mean i i mean is it is it now that okay just don't ever ask for this don't ever ask anything
01:29:32 from this guy ever again like don't like don't ask for maybe because because i would hate like i
01:29:38 i would hate like if i like because i have like other Kickstarter plans and other projects and
01:29:43 it'd be i'd be kind of weird if like he like now i like see him retweeting those and then it's like
01:29:50 okay well what was the deal then you know i don't know i just i just uh i i don't want to come
01:29:59 i mean you're not i mean you're not you're not owed you're not owed or retweet yeah i i agree
01:30:06 i'm not owed anything but like you you know like i i that am i friends and did i think i'm
01:30:14 did i'm fake i'm more friends with this guy than i actually am
01:30:18 like that could be a thing but like i don't know the guy's been on my podcast twice
01:30:22 yeah like he seems to like like my shit i drew a picture from one of his like cards
01:30:28 right yeah i did oh i didn't know that like for the first wave i drew a picture of one of
01:30:34 it one of the cards like he asked me to huh yeah so what card um i did a big homo
01:30:42 oh well it's weird i haven't i haven't i hadn't seen that okay that's really yeah well i don't know um
01:30:50 i don't know maybe he just maybe just maybe he just wasn't a fan of the project for one reason
01:30:54 or another and who knows i maybe has beef with the two other artists that i have on it i don't know
01:31:03 i don't know it could be that's a there's something i'm kind of like
01:31:07 realizing more and more about myself and this should have been more obvious is that um
01:31:12 like it's it's not normal for people to go into other people's DMs and ask for retweets
01:31:18 that's not a normal thing apparently um
01:31:22 because i think more people are i think more people are scared about doing it
01:31:26 like it's it's a very scary thing we would do it's not normal but i mean it's not really normal
01:31:32 to be like a content creator with like a product to market yeah if you are that then i don't think
01:31:41 it's like particularly shameful or problematic to to do that i i think it's um i just i guess
01:31:50 because in the back of my head and i guess not everyone sees it this way and i still don't get
01:31:54 why no one still sees it this way is that retaining something does not take anything away from you
01:32:00 yeah ultimately you know but it feels like people think it does like they lose a little bit like
01:32:07 either their finger breaks pressing the retweet button or they lose a bit of their soul they're
01:32:12 well i mean you retweet a lot yeah i do retweet a lot right i think well i mean i think if a if a
01:32:20 twitter feed is like a if a twitter feed is like content then you you want to retweet
01:32:29 the the fewer things you retweet the more like a spotlight you put on each individual thing
01:32:37 true but i still gotten like my personal stuff like blown up outside of the concert retweeting
01:32:45 right yeah and and the thing is like i feel like people will still see the same number of like
01:32:51 tweets even if you didn't retweet so much you know maybe i i haven't like seen an argument like
01:32:59 against that i think that i think there's an argument to be made that like every every every
01:33:07 retweet you do sort of like takes a little bit of value away from all your other retweets if
01:33:12 someone like actually like brought it like down to me and told me this is like this is the deal
01:33:17 like this is how many like retweets and then i don't think like twitter is ever gonna say that
01:33:21 because it's the thing about they don't want someone to like perfectly game the system right
01:33:28 because that's like what youtube does as well they don't tell you exactly what are the things
01:33:32 or you do or not supposed to do because then like that's how you get like the else of spider man
01:33:37 videos well i mean they i don't think there is like a formula i think it's just like depends on
01:33:44 what people are looking at i because i also saw people say that like you know how they say like
01:33:50 oh if you if you add like a link to like a patreon or kickstarter commission in your tweet
01:33:55 it like makes it makes your twitter tweet seem like you get less people looking at that tweet
01:34:00 yeah yeah yeah yeah right but then i hear people say that that's not true like that's just
01:34:06 yeah people it's not it's not true it's mostly just people hyper focusing on that tweet so
01:34:11 they notice when it doesn't like i yeah i i think the the experience of using twitter generally
01:34:18 is just scrolling down and occasionally slowing down when you see something that's interesting
01:34:24 and so like the amount of retweets it only really becomes like apparent when you're on
01:34:30 that person's page but most people don't go to a person's page they just go to like twitter home
01:34:34 and they scroll down i feel like most people click they go to media tab first if they click on your
01:34:42 page uh yeah if you if you make like knowings yeah yeah if you yeah yeah that that is always
01:34:51 kind of a thing where it's like oh this artist made this really good thing i want to see what
01:34:55 else they do i click on their thing it's like 90 percent retweets of like memes i'm like okay i go
01:35:00 to the media tab and it's also got memes in it and i'm like i just want to see what they do
01:35:06 that is a frustrating thing if you're if you're an artist with a twitter you probably i can
01:35:12 understand why you might have like an an art account and then like a personal account because
01:35:18 like yeah if you want to see someone's art and you go to their twitter and you don't see the art
01:35:22 it's like well what's the point it's it's a balance to strike i don't think uh i don't think um it's
01:35:33 necessarily wrong of somebody to not want to retweet something for any reason i just think it
01:35:40 should be more normal to say no i don't want to do that instead of ghosting instead of saying nothing
01:35:46 saying nah nah i don't i don't want to clutter my page up with that like it that should be more
01:35:51 normal just admitting that that you don't want to do something i i mean i think it's um i mean
01:36:01 i think it's fine if people say they don't i just they fuck my body's stopping me from saying
01:36:11 like i think it's fine if people say no to a retweet my body is my body is physically stopping
01:36:17 me from saying that your mind understands but your heart can't can't it's process like okay
01:36:23 if someone like the thing is like i i feel like any if any mutual goes into my depending on like
01:36:30 i mean depending on what they want me to retweet i would say yes to anything like to any retweet i
01:36:34 don't care right yeah i'll retweet like there's there's people who are like former mutuals who
01:36:39 don't fuck with me and don't like me but i still retweet like their stuff specifically like mission
01:36:45 sheets because like they they need money like shit like i don't fuck with you anymore i mean if they
01:36:53 really like if they really like piss me off then i won't do it but if like they didn't if they're
01:36:58 the one who ghosted me like you know hmm right me i'm not gonna stop i'm not gonna stop retweeting
01:37:08 because i do think they're fine sure right sure i mean i usually just i get that i usually i i
01:37:15 never really think to like go to somebody individually and say hey could you retweet
01:37:20 this thing i usually just post and hope that it gains traction naturally because i i'd rather
01:37:28 i'd rather not converse with people i would do that i would maybe do that if like
01:37:34 i would do that if i was like doing a kickstarter or something i would maybe reach out to like
01:37:41 people who i know on twitter and be like hey you know i'm doing this thing like if you would uh
01:37:49 that's uh that's a little bit more time sensitive you know yeah yeah i didn't do that for my
01:37:54 kickstarter i maybe i should have it's the thing is it really doesn't take anything out of people
01:38:00 i was in um i was in this one discord server and um one of the one of the people that runs
01:38:07 that discord server like posted like two pieces of art in one day and they asked like they asked
01:38:14 like a more popular person there if they could retweet they asked them to repeat retweet the
01:38:18 first one and then when they posted the second one they asked they could do retweet the second one too
01:38:23 and this this person was really like he said like he he was like oh come on dude i already
01:38:28 like i already retweeted the first one and it's like it doesn't break your fucking arm like i was
01:38:34 about to fight this guy too i don't know i was like i was like i was an absorber about it but
01:38:39 like i was i was willing to like fight this guy on this but it's like why he gave he gave a retweet
01:38:45 the second retweet doesn't hurt it doesn't hurt you doesn't break your fucking fingers
01:38:50 well so what the guy wasn't obligated to do the first one and he's not obligated to do the
01:38:57 second one either but but but if they did the first one and like the second one shouldn't have been
01:39:02 that big of a fucking problem oh come on like if it's your buddy like if it's your friend
01:39:08 yeah i i if your buddy is like i don't see how this would be like okay i mean if this is a
01:39:16 total stranger and this is a total fucking i get if it's like a mutual you've never talked to before
01:39:21 and the first thing you when you pop into their dms is this that you know i get that
01:39:28 but this is like this is someone you talk to back and forth you're super casual and friendly
01:39:32 you're like why not like you know it doesn't fucking
01:39:37 it doesn't you know the fucking like end your life i understand i understand i kind of understand
01:39:43 and wanting to keep your feed clean
01:39:48 because if you're if you're if your feed is if your feed is content you want the content to be
01:39:56 good or you want or you want it to be uncluttered you want it to be focused i i understand i i mean
01:40:03 i would i would retweet i would retweet stuff that a buddy made i would definitely do that
01:40:09 but it doesn't mean i'm gonna retweet everything that they make i'm gonna do it if like i think
01:40:14 it's something that they would appreciate it enough that it's like okay the cleanliness of my feed is
01:40:21 not so precious that i won't do this for a guy i i get it if you're the kind because there's some
01:40:30 artists out out there who just never retweet anyone else they're just like constantly reposting
01:40:36 their own work yeah like i get that because there's no point in asking those people to retweet
01:40:41 something because they just don't yeah right yeah um but if you're not that kind of person and you
01:40:47 are like i mean the thing is like if you're willing to retweet uh a picture of someone who you're just
01:40:53 a fan of right like i i feel you should take the the offer for the retweet is is usually more inclined
01:41:01 because it's a buddy you know i mean sure yeah i am if if a buddy you know remember remember when
01:41:10 uh remember when nate wouldn't post the newest pcp on his channel uh even though like he like
01:41:17 got our channel hacked remember that gib uh yeah why did we end up putting it that would
01:41:22 that was i think i think trixie might have put it on her channel i think or something
01:41:28 uh yeah i remember yeah i i thought it was pretty i thought it was pretty uh stupid that
01:41:33 nate was like no i won't uh i won't host an episode of the pcp on my channel because like
01:41:38 the cleanliness of my feed uh lamal but uh so i mean i kind of get it i don't know there was
01:41:47 she was embarrassed about the pcp yeah probably i mean i don't know that was a joke i don't know
01:41:56 how true that it is but i mean like i i get it when it's like your brand or whatever it's like
01:42:03 high quality videos very infrequently and then to put a podcast on there it'd be like oh you're
01:42:11 doing these now like maybe some viewers would be turned off by that um i mean if you just what it
01:42:19 was just one episode right it wasn't like and it's your pot it's your podcast it was it was yeah
01:42:26 yeah i feel like it wouldn't have been a problem but like i can see the the mindset that would
01:42:30 lead you to i could i could see like feeling i feel like see i wouldn't have put it on hypocrite
01:42:37 but i'm totally fine putting it on gib and take because gib and take is just a grand bag of stuff
01:42:42 you know sure right i guess i guess um checking the general real quick
01:42:52 why am i looking at this
01:42:56 that's what that's what happens when you retweet something so when your big art is
01:43:00 that's what happens to you uh you become like you become a moldy Voldemort sad but you become a
01:43:07 little a little fried up fetus i think it's a banana or something it looks like as tea yeah it does
01:43:15 look like it has teeth maybe it's like a little yeah it's the root is it like a root of a plant
01:43:24 the legs look like banana peels almost like the leg i don't it kind of looks like maybe it was
01:43:29 been edited because it looks like that little hands there is too much of a hand the hands on the feet
01:43:35 look very like deliberate this is what a fetus looks like on the fourth month this is a banana fetus
01:43:42 the banana fetus i call it i call it the fried fetus yeah i have to pee again and i'm gonna go
01:43:50 do it no one can stop me you gotta go abort that fried fetus right now man all right um
01:43:57 uh you got any more insight for me gib uh on on on what on retweeting whatever
01:44:06 this is really sweet yeah sure uh well my policy has always been that i retweet things that i think
01:44:15 are cool and that maybe my followers haven't seen so it's like do that too it's like oh
01:44:25 this is a cool art and this is from this this cool art i have been notified because i follow
01:44:31 someone and they liked it and it's got it's only got 12 likes um but this is really good
01:44:38 so i retweet it and like it and be like i'm glad to share that cool thing with people i do occasionally
01:44:45 do like the the sort of obligatory retweeting for awareness um even though it's like you know it's
01:44:51 just sort of like a friend thing it's like oh it's a gotta let people know you know gotta let
01:44:57 people know about this even though my followers aren't this is not that many of them uh like
01:45:02 generally speaking i don't think it's i don't think i've ever really had like a problem retweeting
01:45:09 something that maybe my followers are not interested in okay i'm back but i'm also not like that big
01:45:15 of a twitter user like it like i don't have so many followers that i don't i probably wouldn't
01:45:24 even hear about like negative feedback about a thing i retweet anyway so i don't know it's
01:45:29 just sort of like a doesn't really come up my day-to-day twitter usage
01:45:38 hey did you guys um you guys see that's the jorts the cat drama on twitter this week
01:45:44 genuinely cannot comprehend any of it what the fuck are you talking about uh it was the
01:45:51 word it was the word it literally the worst thing ever literally the worst thing that's ever happened
01:45:56 wait is that the so angry that the grubhub one uh more or less yeah i think you're thinking
01:46:03 about it you run that because i saw i saw you guys talking about it but i didn't read it because
01:46:07 you guys were talking a mile a minute yeah uh all right i'll try and some i'll try and summarize
01:46:13 uh and i'm gonna be as and i'm gonna be as neutral and i'm gonna be as factual as possible here
01:46:20 all right so what what happened was this lady uh with a not huge account but like a big-ish
01:46:27 account like 10k or something um made a tweet about how men can't shop and every time she gets
01:46:36 a mail instacart shopper they fuck up the order so one time she tracked down the man that was shopping
01:46:44 for her and found him standing in the aisle of the supermarket looking at his phone this was this
01:46:50 was the tweet yes i remember that and this and this cat this gimmick he is apparently a pro labor cat
01:47:00 this is like a cat account who retweets like union efforts which is great i guess
01:47:08 this so this guy just so this george the cat gimmick account said idea get your own groceries
01:47:15 or idea buy your own groceries now what do what do you think happened after after george the cat
01:47:20 said this uh i know people got mad yeah that's all i know do you know why because he's a cat
01:47:29 and cats can't be involved in human life because he's able is yes that's right
01:47:38 see on the face of it that always seemed a bit silly because if she tracked him down
01:47:44 she clearly went to the store and she's in front of the groceries which she could then buy
01:47:51 yes it's not like she was unable in that instance to get the groceries she just like the convenience
01:47:57 which is what the app is for that's right and then what happened i mean i mean that's the the the
01:48:08 fear the fear was you know a lot a lot of accounts tweeted that george is ableist because uh because
01:48:15 he said get your own groceries i thought that was and if and if you said that to a disabled person
01:48:21 that can't get their own groceries that would be really bad but what if you said that to someone
01:48:26 else and it was in a worse context maybe you think ever think about that i i i don't know i don't know
01:48:34 um this listen i'm minimizing it i'm minimizing the the irreversible psychic damage that has been
01:48:42 done to me this week i i will i swear i will never be the same this is this this this this has broken
01:48:48 me this has tipped me over the edge i am less of a person now than i was before see i didn't look
01:48:53 into it but like it seemed like a huge deal i was sure there was more to it than the ableism
01:49:01 that no it's it's literally like people it's it's literally disabled people said like
01:49:09 this this is about me this is this would be ableist if you said this to me and now the fact that you
01:49:16 said this to someone who isn't disabled is now people are gonna say this to me also and that
01:49:25 and how could you do this to me george how could you do this to me george george the cat used to
01:49:30 be an institution you could trust and now now that's been stained okay um uh it's just i i i just i
01:49:44 what is the it went on for like two days people were angry at george george for being ableist
01:49:49 for telling this woman and then like and then it kind of evolved because people people were
01:49:57 people were saying people were talking about how much they need instacart right and it literally
01:50:02 is like totally beside the point because it doesn't matter how much you a disabled person
01:50:08 need or rely on instacart literally irrelevant to to what happened and but people kept making
01:50:14 these posts about how i'm disabled and i need instacart i'm disabled and i rely on instacart
01:50:20 and if an instacart gig worker got my order wrong it would financially devastate me or whatever and
01:50:25 like great first first of all i i use as someone who has used instacart i know that you can just
01:50:33 fucking report a like wrong order and they will just refund it you can just fucking complain to
01:50:39 them and they will give you your money back it's it's totally deranged to be like it would
01:50:44 financially devastate me if my instacart shopper got my order wrong that would never wait wait
01:50:49 whose side are they on then i thought they were mad at george for saying get your own groceries
01:50:54 but they're also mad at the idea of a guy getting the groceries wrong there's there's two sides
01:50:58 well yeah yeah yeah because because this woman because this woman is right to stalk and harass
01:51:05 her gig worker because if she had been disabled and this guy had got her order wrong that would
01:51:11 be abuse you see that would be abuse of the disabled it's it's the two sides it's uh it's
01:51:20 the you know it's the people who like are mad at the grub hub worker keeps fucking up the order
01:51:26 and then the people are kind of like if they keep fucking up why don't you just get the order
01:51:30 and then i'm super abled that evolves into the oh well what if i'm disabled and i'm like what if
01:51:36 the grub hub worker is disabled like what if the grub what if what if the shopper's disabled
01:51:41 bro what if i what if the shopper's disabled what if i go into your house and fucking kill
01:51:45 what if i slit your throat while you're asleep what the fuck about that people you never consider
01:51:50 that as an option and people started posting their stuff and there were there were a few
01:51:55 very weird ones that were like i have adhd and therefore i can't shop in person therefore i have
01:52:02 to therefore i need i need a gig worker to do it for me and and also i reserve the right to stalk
01:52:10 them if they do it wrong i you know this woman was right this woman was right to stalk to stalk
01:52:16 her her gig worker it's he was abusing her i know um what else did i
01:52:28 i'm glad like i haven't really thought about it in the last couple days but like when it was going
01:52:31 on this was like i was i was i'm glad i'm glad i have some distance from it let's just say i'm
01:52:37 glad i have some distance from it because i could i could not deal with it yes it was so infuriating
01:52:47 trying to think what else yeah but she do she do got a point though men suck at shopping though
01:52:52 she's right she's right about men men do be men do be failing at shopping they do be failing at
01:52:57 shopping right that's really the whole like literally the whole point of the original post
01:53:02 was like men suck oh the whole point of the original post was men suck and then
01:53:10 and then and then jorts dammit jorts i i i thought i could trust you i i thought i believed in you
01:53:17 jorts and you let me down he he and he apologized he made a full apology for his boneheaded post
01:53:24 that hurt so many people and and he said like oh yeah me and this woman we've reconciled like
01:53:29 donate to her go fund me uh you know uh of course she ended she ended up being a turf obviously
01:53:37 ended up being a car but it doesn't matter because the uh because the fake disabled
01:53:42 bullies demanded demanded blood and even and even after and even after even after the apology
01:53:49 people were still posting like it's not enough jorts it's not enough to set off the harm you
01:53:55 call it would you please please work with the disabled community to continue to like to like
01:54:01 undo the irreparable harm that you've caused with your thoughtless comments jorts has to go like
01:54:05 to the school to school talking about why being uh able is there is there is no there is no appeasing
01:54:12 some people there's no appeasing some people and you should never apologize you should never ever
01:54:17 apologize for anything it's because you'll it'll never be enough that's what i've learned he posted
01:54:23 jorts jorts will never there's nothing jorts could do to to to wipe the stain of ableism off
01:54:28 of him now it's too late that's so true ben just like i'll never apologize for for being too nice
01:54:34 and giving people all of money that i can't promise them i will never apologize ever the apology
01:54:40 you will you will perish you will you will you will you will perish you'll be wiped from the
01:54:44 face of the earth hypocrite ben got him that's me you actually you will fail you will the free
01:54:50 market the free market will devour you a more ruthless a more ruthless uh uh artist will fear
01:54:56 the market will take your place in the market is what will happen to you my friend i'm so scared
01:55:03 you well i well guess what ben guess what ben guess what guess what i'm disabled so i'm gonna
01:55:09 need you to like no i'm disabled no i'm disabled oh yeah from myself down the stairs it's sort of
01:55:16 like beat top that it's sort of like you imagine somebody just posting a tweet saying i had a
01:55:22 really good run today and then somebody said um i can't run so yeah that's funny this morning i saw
01:55:30 people were reacting to like some lady posted about how much she liked sitting in her garden
01:55:35 and how much she loved her husband oh yeah people were like um not all of us can afford gardens or
01:55:40 husbands yeah or husbands yeah it's just sort of like okay i i you're reading into my non-tweet
01:55:52 like non position so many positions i have i have i like i have i and i and i don't think anybody
01:56:00 has anything against like anyone who is disabled and relies on like a gig to like do their grocery
01:56:07 delivery like it's fine and like literally nobody is mad about that but they they they they this
01:56:14 totally unrelated thing a certain kind of person saw this as an attack on them yeah personally for
01:56:21 some reason and made a big discourse about it that lasted like three days and i hated it
01:56:29 was so angry it really it was like the worst it was it was probably the worst twitter discourse
01:56:35 of 2022 if i had to if i had to put my it really had to gun to my gun to my head this was the worst
01:56:42 i mean it's a funny thing to say because like twitter discourse is so vapid and so like nothing
01:56:48 that i completely forget every single one of them i don't even know what happened this year on
01:56:51 twitter i'll never forget i'll never forget where were you when george said get your own
01:56:58 like can you even name a single other twitter discourse that happened this year
01:57:02 there's there's so like like you know in the moment and they think is that they tend to repeat
01:57:08 they do they kind of tend to repeat and go in cycles i am i started some discourse in in cell
01:57:13 discourse men aren't men aren't having enough sex that one comes up every now and then
01:57:18 nice um what else i don't know uh i don't know some careful careful shit careful um
01:57:27 me when i when i decided to go after bendy and was labeled in ableist because it turned out
01:57:34 bendy was disabled me no me oh bendy yeah oh that blue guy yeah blue guy was he disabled no
01:57:44 who was like he was like in his thirties or something is that like the i guess we
01:57:48 know that well that's that's a disability that's a disability yeah bendy the the
01:57:53 fucking indie horror game mascot um so there's bendy the and the ink machine that's the video
01:57:59 game and then there's bendy fan one two three or something like that he's like his bendy fan 1488
01:58:06 on twitter bendy yeah and uh and i know i know the horror game you're thinking of but that's
01:58:12 that's a different he was like uh he was like a adult larpy and i was like a 13 year old oh yeah
01:58:16 bendy fan 13 i was and he was like oh wait i remember the blue yeah the blue guy yeah yeah yeah
01:58:23 and like i went once it was revealed that he was like an adult and um had was posting such
01:58:30 shit in in the week that he was active um i made a tweet like uh like shitting on people for drawing
01:58:38 fan art of him because in my head i thought like okay well these things come in cycles right like
01:58:43 people people love the guy and then everyone starts shitting on him so i'm going to jump ahead of the
01:58:48 line on the whole shitting on him but no it turns out people still love them even though it was he
01:58:53 was like i come i remember i'll be honest i never really saw that guy around i i saw like yeah
01:58:59 but that's how that works always right like i never saw any of the george the cat shit
01:59:03 it wait wait so you just you just decided to like get out ahead of like you were like this is a
01:59:08 popular guy i'm sure he will eventually be exposed no he was already he was already exposed so i'm
01:59:13 going to be the first hater i'm going to be the the primordial hater of this guy so when he
01:59:18 eventually the community turns on him i'll be the guy that everyone looks to and be like this
01:59:22 guy knew it this guy called it no no i he was already exposed by the time i made the tweet
01:59:27 but i guess the news did not reach around that fast what was the expose what was he was he was
01:59:34 just that he was older he was large his whole plan was that um he made this account where he was
01:59:40 like pretending to be 13 and he would like draw his shitty like bendy oc's and he would like
01:59:46 go around and like pretend to be a cringey 13 year old and then one and he would do the thing
01:59:51 where it's like oh can you draw my character and someone actually did it and it blew up and he
01:59:56 became super popular really quick right because everyone was under the idea that he was just some
02:00:02 13 year old like just trying to try and just trying to make it on twitter right and and just
02:00:08 trying to make it but then people like trying to make and he's only been around for like that that
02:00:11 guy's gmi yeah you should you should learn a thing or two from that guy yeah i should i should pretend
02:00:16 to be 13 and then be like hey guys i started a cloud point kicks whatever um you're a minor uh
02:00:25 you can't be doing that what's um for what happens if a minor like draws porn um they immediately
02:00:34 teleport to jail i have if a minor wants to draw a porn go ahead just don't post it online
02:00:40 you shouldn't post any of your is it like is it like illegal for a minor to like draw a porn
02:00:45 and post it no it's not there's no law it's just sort of like it just shouldn't be encouraged i guess
02:00:51 because the there'll be it's weird because they don't really know what they're doing it is very
02:00:58 weird and but i feel like there's so many people out there who encourage it yeah i i see um i've
02:01:04 never i've never seen like a minor posting porn i've definitely seen minors posting some kind
02:01:09 of itchy stuff though yeah um there's like a there's like a i don't like there's an art style to the
02:01:17 that crab girl there's there's someone there's someone with an oc that looks exactly like
02:01:22 the villain in that meme in mimi ori's comic yeah you know you you know the oc i'm talking
02:01:29 about the girl with the crab there's like another guy would have there's another guy who has a
02:01:32 crab girl oc but he doesn't drop yeah he's he's not a minor anything to draw porn as far as i know
02:01:38 hmm well there's one well there's there's one person who i thought was a minor who has a girl
02:01:43 with crab claw hair and and he and he draws and it looks like it looks like uh frickin uh craig
02:01:50 mccracken cartoon but bad um but there's like butts this it's it's definitely it's definitely itchy
02:01:58 it's definitely the most like the most like pop the most like fame infamous of the minor she drew
02:02:03 porn was um ink plasm you know i'm praying you know ink plasm nope um no he kind of has this
02:02:12 kind of like almost like imagine like adventure time characters but thicker like they have big
02:02:17 hips and big tits that's kind of like the art style for the miners who draw porn if you're a
02:02:22 minor you draw like that you probably draw porn like secretly oh i i've seen um this oc
02:02:29 okay it's like a lizard girl anyway that guy yeah that guy would draw very suggestive things and
02:02:35 people would get mad at him but he would always be like oh okay i'm just oh guys i'm just a minor
02:02:39 guys guys i'm just a minor as i'm just a minor don't be mad but then it got revealed
02:02:44 but then it got revealed that he he would secretly do nsfw commission it's like he would keep it under
02:02:49 like like he wouldn't tell anyone yeah so he was doing that the whole time being a minor that got
02:02:55 him a lot of like negative attention but i mean but i mean why would you mention that he's not him
02:03:00 that's gonna get in trouble for it wouldn't it be the people that are doing something wrong it would
02:03:05 be the people commissioning him but he at the end of the day he's like a bigger name that them
02:03:10 than them so he's gonna get all the attention for it right yeah yeah um yeah like i think i think
02:03:17 you're a minor and i think there's just like very like what i mean people are really what are you
02:03:23 gonna do the whole like call the cops yeah yeah he's doing it again he's drawing he's drawing big
02:03:32 titty lizard girls yeah he's only 13 see 13 no no i'm joking but okay okay i i i have no idea how
02:03:41 the guy was when i know he's like 18 now he's not he's not a minor no good for him so retroactively
02:03:47 all the stuff he did was is a okay now it's all okay now yeah because now he's 18 it's all good
02:03:55 yeah it's just it's like a discussion to be had about like the prevalence of not safe work
02:04:00 imagery on the internet and how easy it is to get but like i don't know how different that is from
02:04:05 how it used to be it just sort of like now social media means that you you're more able and and
02:04:12 encouraged to post whatever you make on the internet for everyone to see i i don't and people don't
02:04:18 people if they can't tell based on your art skill how young you are you just get away with lying
02:04:26 yeah i i don't i try never mostly to never follow any minors um because like i'm really like a
02:04:36 pose of a minor being popular on the internet who needs that yeah like i i think that's i think
02:04:42 that's not good for people and the minor if you shouldn't be popular and if you're a minor i think
02:04:47 that fucks you up yeah you shouldn't be on the internet until you're 28 i yeah exactly i i think
02:04:53 like you bird out a lot quicker if you're popular as a minor you know you know how people complain
02:04:58 about how like oh because kids nowadays have easier access to like digital art program so they're
02:05:04 learning art skills at a way faster pace that's why you get like minors who draw so well but but in
02:05:11 retrospect um because they're minors and they're so so susceptible to like trying to be popular
02:05:17 online they bird out quicker and they usually delete their account at a younger age yeah which
02:05:24 is pretty base and then that leaves us the adults still around your mentally sound and be like ha ha
02:05:30 minor minor couldn't cut it it's meant to be bad so they couldn't cut it stupid big baby you should
02:05:35 have been so good at r u motherfucker i sure hate it when somebody young is better than me at something
02:05:42 so i love it when they die yeah i don't die inside and i say grow up into a ball i say what the people
02:05:50 want to say you know i i say the things people actually want to say you know i don't sugar
02:05:55 code i'm not a little pussy bitch you know you know i'm me and me and george george the cat we
02:06:00 got a lot in common actually you know george the cat he betrayed me he betrayed me i had i believed
02:06:07 in him you were the chosen one i thought he was based but he would he ended up being a friend she was
02:06:13 grand yeah yeah can't believe he caved can't believe he let me down so sad so sad hey while we're
02:06:22 uh sort of on the topic of arts and stuff um i got new commissions i've got a new commission
02:06:29 thing oh that's right i'm doing more i finished all of the old ones and now i'm doing more
02:06:34 nice you've been you've been getting better you've been getting better at art give i really
02:06:40 thank you um i thought i thought you were gonna i thought you were gonna be uh working on Clarissa
02:06:47 i am um it's actually it's funny i was talking to my therapist about like ah jeez these commissions
02:06:53 taking so long ah shit ah fuck and she was sort of like encouraging me to you know finish them
02:07:00 and then like like do more because i was worried i was i was worried about like oh people was i took
02:07:08 so long on those last ones what if people hate me and they'll never commission me again and so
02:07:13 she's saying for you should you should do it again like for peace of mind see what see what
02:07:18 happens because you if you worry about like potential bad things happening in the future
02:07:24 based on like zero information um you're just going to be worried forever so like actually
02:07:30 just do it and see what happens if people don't want to commission you anymore then you know
02:07:34 you have more actual real reality information that you can base future decisions off so that's
02:07:39 why i'm doing it it's like uh it's a it's a it's a i don't know testing the waters because i do
02:07:47 worry about things without like like i think of the worst possible outcome and i worry about that
02:07:53 when i don't actually know what's likely to happen because i haven't tried anything
02:07:58 so that's why i'm doing it and i think it's gonna go well i've already started one
02:08:03 and it's looking great i've been very more productive recently uh just good also on clarris as
02:08:09 well very nice very nice it's pretty nice i sent me to um get you the script for the guest comment

02:10:10 i mean not not because not because like i wouldn't do that for anybody else but because um
02:10:16 you're mean specifically mean yeah mean yeah i like you yeah you're meanie you're a big meanie
02:10:21 head and um i'm gonna starve you by not giving you money i'm gonna starve you whether yet
02:10:30 you look at it could i get residuals in in the form of uh shout outs and retweets for for my guest
02:10:37 comic it's like every 10 minutes you retweet one of my posts you know i give you know like yes and
02:10:47 also um open wide i'm gonna dump with this barrel of free estrogen down your mouth just wow yeah
02:10:54 ben ben doesn't get any though no none for ben hell yeah what the fuck ben ben just gonna get
02:11:00 you missed out and this is i don't be like balding ben but it's fucking
02:11:08 i'll be like that's all you two i'm yeah i'm two months i'm two months into my uh into my uh
02:11:16 not finasteride what's the other if i just into my minoxidil application so another month or two
02:11:22 and we'll see if uh anything happens there and then we'll have and then we'll have the last laugh
02:11:28 maybe what would you do ben if only one hair grew a lot and it was like a one really long curl at the
02:11:35 top you would kill him i don't want to cut it what the fuck he would make a it would make a rope out
02:11:42 of it to hang himself yeah what if he had exactly enough of the hair to make the Homer Simpson
02:11:47 you were gonna say what if like there was one hair but it was like really thick like it was like a
02:11:52 whole like inch in diameter yeah like like a twisted realm like a like a a rope that's horrible
02:11:58 that's too scary to even think about um uh the the the what shit i feel like i'm gonna say something
02:12:06 else about extra souls um the only yeah the only residuals i need are that executive producer credit
02:12:12 just um all right just just print just print just print that print it with print it with executive
02:12:18 producer ben saint and i'll be and i'll be more than happy it'll be on the cover and i'll be bigger
02:12:24 than the title yeah actually actually instead of like a traditional cover just put the tie just put
02:12:31 just in in times new roman right or in like in like typewriter font an aerial not aerial just
02:12:37 just have it look like a screenplay and just say extra souls executive producer ben saint and that's
02:12:42 all and then you can have the cover page on the inside the title is gonna be ben saint presents
02:12:47 a ben saint production a ben ben saints extra souls that's what's gonna be the title i just
02:12:54 realized i don't know what extra souls is what is this oh what maybe i know what that is is it
02:13:02 do you want to explain it i'll tell it okay so extra souls is um it's a comic it's that i wrote
02:13:08 based on a short film that i was working on years ago and i had to cancel
02:13:13 and um i rewrote it as a comic and i've been talking to several different artists about drawing it
02:13:20 and twice it twice it fell through like two artists couldn't like finish it they couldn't
02:13:25 like they like lost their interest very quickly and then i finally um got me me already to do it
02:13:31 and the plan was that like uh we would like do the whole pre-order things on the on the comic and
02:13:37 she would get like 800 the first 800 would be hers by the fault um then i told ben about it and
02:13:45 ben just offered to give her because well because maybe because mimi already said like she wanted
02:13:49 to do it yeah but she like couldn't justify like taking the time to do it on like the promise of
02:13:55 future payment well she was gonna she was gonna do it she was gonna do it already before you came
02:14:00 along it's just that yeah but it was like down the price it was like down the priorities list so like
02:14:05 who knows when it would have ever actually gotten done right yes that's true so ben ben came along
02:14:12 um executive producer ben to say um that's right came along and just gave her the 800 and she's
02:14:20 been i just i just said i'll just i'll just pay it now i'll just pay it now so you can start doing
02:14:24 it now and then you can when you sell the book later you can pay me back uh uh cool anyway i
02:14:33 didn't hear any i didn't hear about it for a long time but i guess you asked her recently and she
02:14:37 said she is back at it so that's cool yeah she it was like yeah because um she's just she kind of
02:14:44 her life has kind of changed since like the last we started right i think she moved to whole new state
02:14:50 and started a new job but um she's taking priority in the book now so she's still speaking of
02:14:56 speaking of speaking of uh comics i'm still waiting i'm still waiting for i think simsie has
02:15:02 probably dropped that one page that he sketched i don't think he's gonna finish it at this point
02:15:12 should i give him the clown note deal uh royalties forever bad no no um
02:15:20 um kai kaiju asked me like a week or two ago
02:15:26 he like asked what was left and i told him he's he he was supposed to draw the cover
02:15:30 and there's like one other page he was gonna do and i haven't heard back from him but he'll
02:15:35 probably get it done at some point and new new i know you're listening you sketched two you
02:15:42 sketched three pages and then you finished one and i and i sorry i DM'd you back late but uh
02:15:49 whenever you finish those uh i want those other two please do them thanks they look really good
02:15:59 by the way the sketches look really good i think that's it and i i think that like
02:16:05 like two more pages from new and like two more from kaiju and one that i think simsie was gonna do
02:16:10 but maybe i'll have to find someone else to do it and like that's that's it for the the dojin
02:16:16 crazy yeah i know new can do it i just offered him a comic for um that volume two and he says
02:16:24 gonna take that who uh new new yeah uh well good for him uh well uh well nevertheless that's
02:16:34 that's the plan the next week next time the next vapor's chapter comes out i'm gonna drop the next
02:16:40 clown milk snatch up everybody for the minute did i um did i already say did i already say
02:16:51 that i know i said last week that i might have the video done this week but this time i really
02:16:57 mean it guys like really for real this time uh yeah yeah well i'm saying it again um i i should have
02:17:09 i had yesterday i honestly i like could have finished it yesterday but i didn't uh uh i like
02:17:14 like like all i have to do for it to be like done is basically just watch it through and just like
02:17:22 make and just like go into the file and make any corrections because like sometimes there's
02:17:25 like a gap in the footage or sometimes like an image got like moved at some point and it's in
02:17:32 the wrong place and i have to just like find those and just move them back to where they should be
02:17:37 and and um i'm like i'm like two hours through re-watching my eight hour video and uh it's
02:17:45 hard and i don't like it i'm sick of looking at it i don't want to watch it anymore but i just have
02:17:51 to put like there's another i just have to get through it i have to get through it and then
02:17:58 it'll be done and then i'm post it so i i'll probably post it this week i'll probably post it
02:18:02 before this episode comes out so i hope it's out by the time this episode is is published and that
02:18:09 will be fun that'll be fun this is gonna be your eight hour um rebuttal to uh two unique
02:18:16 name of source is eight hour in the pentagonist tea video right yes um there's like a hurricane
02:18:27 going on outside like suddenly there's like a loud thunder and now it's like there are leaves
02:18:33 like pelting my window at like a hundred miles an hour nice i can hear a little bit of it yeah it's
02:18:41 cool i don't hear anything this is really like amazing actually there's another thunder dude i got
02:18:48 to film this i'm gonna film this wow just all out of nowhere huh yeah she's got to get distracted
02:18:58 like that i don't know where um wait how long are we even going are we at three hours or two
02:19:04 two two hours and 20 minutes um uh i'm trying to think if i can mention there's some more
02:19:10 things i could i could talk about um sure yeah i go i've been talking to eddie adam i also want
02:19:15 to shout out eddie adam again is he still on twitter no good okay good he's smart he's he's
02:19:23 on instagram oh okay the idea for instagram i'm a shout out to like eddie adam's i gotta tell you
02:19:30 there was like a there was like a handful of people out there who like who are who are friends of
02:19:37 mine who just did not who i really had to fucking convince to give me one retweet on clown milk
02:19:45 right yeah i really had to like i'm not gonna say any names oblivion fall i'm not gonna say any names
02:19:50 but um um eddie like eddie does not like clowns eddie does not fuck with clowns
02:19:58 okay like right but eddie likes me and so eddie like did at least like three posts about clown
02:20:05 milk on instagram well good good ol good ol eddie and eddie's a real eddie's a real g for
02:20:12 doing that eddie like i i appreciate eddie a lot all right sorry i'm back uh it was it was like i
02:20:18 was in a car wash so fucking so much wet are you gonna post the video i will eventually it's annoying
02:20:26 getting stuff off my phone i'm at the edge of my seat you can't you can't just put it in discord
02:20:31 i i probably can hang on put it in discord posted in the general sometimes the videos are too big
02:20:38 yeah discord who knows sometimes let me try speaking of videos being too big i rent i test
02:20:45 rendered a 720p resolution version unfinished version of the video it took like 30 hours to render uh
02:20:55 i uploaded it it's on my channel unlisted just to see if it would catch any like uh copyright
02:21:02 claims it did not so that's good um uh so that's it's gonna oh my god but i have to render it in um
02:21:12 it's it's filmed in 2k you know like like a 222 uh what's the resolution thousand kilograms
02:21:20 it's it's 225 60 by 1440 so not 4k but it's like higher than higher than hd uh so that's gonna be uh
02:21:33 that's gonna take like 60 fucking out so actually you know what i said the video would be out this
02:21:38 week no it won't it'll be done this week but then it'll take an entire other week just to
02:21:43 render the fucking video so uh sorry about that you should make a you should make a live feed of
02:21:49 it rendering so like people could watch that yeah i wonder if anyone's ever thought of that just a
02:21:56 live feed of a video rendering just watch the bar i feel like it would slow down the render though
02:22:01 having to process and then send out the footage of it so if you hate if you hate the person you
02:22:07 will watch the stream to slow down their rendering um yeah so um the reason why i mentioned eddie
02:22:18 adam's earlier is because i've been talking to him about him because eddie adams mostly publishes
02:22:23 stuff through a through a publication called silver sprocket and um they're pretty um there
02:22:30 there's they're like what i like is that they're like big enough that they can get like um their
02:22:36 books like across like the country in different bookstores but also that they're small enough
02:22:42 that they still look at like smaller indie people right yeah so i was talking to him about like um
02:22:48 potentially getting extra souls published through uh silver sprocket and he laid it down to me and
02:22:54 it sounds um it sounds pretty it sounds very fucking doable it sounds really fucking incredibly
02:23:00 doable um and i mean to just kind of give you an idea of like what kind of stuff they do um
02:23:06 silver sprocket is the is a publisher that published the complete collection of mr boob
02:23:12 so yeah yeah that's the kind of that's kind of caliber we're trying to get to you know
02:23:19 and i feel like it's possible i feel like um we get um we get uh does um this remi boy del
02:23:26 published through them too um i don't think so i think remi goes through image comics
02:23:33 oh okay yeah or the i mean the pervert was publisher image comics i remember that
02:23:40 okay um there's a handful they have a whole other website they have like the whole list of people
02:23:46 they've worked with um you know i see uh yeah i mean i've heard of them i think i i mean they
02:23:57 mr boob is a good yeah yeah right we're gonna um we're gonna outshine mr boob we're gonna blow
02:24:03 his ass out of the water hmm i think this will work oh my god new video by gibb and take video
02:24:14 on google photos oh i'm watching it oh it's a video oh it's oh hell yeah oh hell yeah there it goes
02:24:27 whoo getting getting a big old thunder lightning flying through the window yes there it is the flash
02:24:38 oh my god she's in this video wow that is some wet that's some big way there that's some
02:24:46 damn i'm feeling damp just just looking at it it's um

02:31:43 i'll ever wear it it's like a it's like it's not like lab coat fabric it's like a niceish fabric

02:32:04 know i just went in there and i was like i found something and i think i would have bought it no

02:32:15 it that is the item i described yes okay well obviously there's only one carry there you should
02:32:22 there's one character that ben shank ben saint should obviously be and this is a throwback
02:32:31 waiting for the punchline remember this character yeah that's right well as i have explained now
02:32:39 multiple times that is a dark gray lab coat it is not white well i don't care just just one one
02:32:45 say no okay fine i will even even if you even if you were to do an accurate doctor and say no
02:32:51 outfit people would still not know who the fuck you are so it doesn't matter they can be well it's
02:32:56 okay yeah spoonie's got the got pretty nice teeth pretty pretty decent pretty decent set of teeth on
02:33:05 that guy he's a youthful boy that's true yeah where is he now is he dead he uh yeah he's dead
02:33:15 live streams on his channel uh every so often more frequently recently i'm still subscribed
02:33:21 i just never click on them because then they're very like low-key sort of streams nothing nothing
02:33:30 like his over-the-top ostentatious like persona in his videos it's very very quiet very like a comment
02:33:37 every so often it's like yeah it's not really for me no way antweiler is still uh his patreon is
02:33:45 still he's making silly videos 79 patrons 285 a month 285 they have that that's right it beats me
02:33:55 by a couple of a couple of bucks he's making bank true true you pay rent in arizona without money
02:34:04 yeah did i um oh my god his his his patreon blurb i'm i'm sure he just hasn't touched it in a while
02:34:14 and just hasn't thought about it but like it still references like projects he was doing in like 2012
02:34:20 the cinema snob movie press start to continue suburban nights and to boldly flee are all on here
02:34:27 that's fucking funny as hell you gotta put the you gotta put on the classics you know up there
02:34:33 the most recognizable works you know suburban nights internet classic did i say last time
02:34:42 that like i think that i'm like restructuring my patreon i think i did talk about that i mean
02:34:48 yeah yeah um i'm hoping i'm hoping i'm hoping i'm hoping i'm hoping i can see a bump in my patreon
02:34:57 from the new video and like i'm offering some new i'm offering some new stuff on there in the hopes
02:35:02 that it the sort of gets me back gets me back to like where i was like a year or two ago that would
02:35:09 be nice once i knew once i knew video drops i will offer fans i swear i'm offering value
02:35:17 once a new video drops and uh you you ask for merriweather for that retweet
02:35:23 i'm not gonna ask merriweather for the retweet they're gonna ask merriweather for the retweet
02:35:28 i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna mention i'm gonna thank him i'm gonna thank him for
02:35:32 encouraging me to make the video i'm not gonna ask him for the retweet and you're hoping that and
02:35:37 and you know what i i genuinely don't think it matters if you retweets or not it's like
02:35:42 it would be nice i don't i don't think i don't think a retweet from him would even like do anything
02:35:47 would get me like a couple thousand views who cares that's a couple thousand you didn't have
02:35:53 buck him you're like no ben i saw you talking shit about my my ugly bastard come
02:36:02 i wasn't though i'm very generous i was very generous i swear no i i swear i wasn't
02:36:10 no no i wasn't look i compared just because i compared it to dar man i meant that in the
02:36:17 most complimentary way possible um all right what are we talking about what are we doing
02:36:26 oh wait okay check check this out tell me what you think of this
02:36:32 it's a triple eel it's a triple eel wait what is it a mash up of
02:36:37 is this the eel it's the eel from the super mario and there's three of them there's um there's
02:36:44 like one of these to combine two enemies this is just three of one enemy kind kind of it's it's
02:36:51 mostly just cash catchy um there's there's a in super mario bros too there's like a tree
02:36:57 head snake so i'm like oh i should make like a tree headed something else oh yeah i remember that i
02:37:03 remember that snake of course this is a mash up of this snake i'm not gonna lie i would say like
02:37:10 maybe like one third of these ideas are just like this is just a mario enemy i wish existed
02:37:15 like i i think would be like interesting to have i'm trying to think of like looking at this guy
02:37:22 like how how useful really is he as a predator having three heads what if they get distracted by
02:37:28 different mice what if they what if they go in different directions and they all pull and then
02:37:33 like slam like that's how you stretch back and hit themselves in the head and they that's how you
02:37:38 heard of that's how you heard of it that's how the boss fight he's one of those bosses where you
02:37:42 have to make him hurt himself you have to spread gossip about one head shit talking the other
02:37:48 and they bite each other yeah some of these um some of these are just like kind of like i i just
02:37:53 think this would be an interesting idea for a mario enemy like this shy guy isn't really a mashup of
02:38:00 of any two characters is just like oh what if you just draw on the shy guy's face yeah like that
02:38:06 mm-hmm mm-hmm it's just it's just cute you know what if there was a shy guy but they had huge
02:38:14 tits though whoa whoa calm down there buddy i'm just i'm just slow down slow down whoa what is that
02:38:21 a fusion of um uh shy guy and the big booby that's not mario enemy uh you're you're thinking too
02:38:31 limited you're you're stopping short of greatness with that with that attitude okay um people have
02:38:39 been asking me and by people i mean one person one discord server asked me to when am i going to do
02:38:45 a bowser fusion and that's actually going to be the last one because i have a pretty i had a pretty
02:38:50 good idea for a bowser fusion uh barrio will you tell us or is it a secret bower yo it's a secret
02:38:58 um like they'll just say i i fuse bowser with um a very evil character ever a very uh like
02:39:06 very malicious character is what a character that a character that that has um that predates
02:39:17 the mario franchise but very evil uh bonky kong wait i know who it is i know who it is
02:39:25 who do you want to guess you have to guess is it the villain no oh never does is it satan
02:39:33 uh maybe maybe it's satan okay maybe maybe it's satan from from real life or from ghouls
02:39:44 and goblins satan for real life you know satan by neighbor
02:39:56 huh what do you mean ghouls and goblins what are you talking about goblins and ghosts what's that game
02:40:02 the little guy of the night super ghouls and ghosts goblins and goblins ghosts and goblins
02:40:08 ghosts and goblins yeah yeah ghosts and goblins that's satan it satan is uh the final boss in that
02:40:14 game yeah if you said there's there's bosses called the devil and then there's one called satan
02:40:21 or let's see the way around there's like uh there's a little red guy firebrand who's my um
02:40:28 who's my uh my kin a kin firebrand literally me
02:40:35 is that a pony is that a pony's name firebrand firebrand wait a minute wasn't that josh scorcher's
02:40:41 pony who the what who uh oh ben what are you talking about
02:40:49 shh gosh is josh scorcher you ever everybody knows josh scorcher the fiery joker
02:40:57 josh scorcher is that the josh scorcher is like the name of the of the alter ego of ghost writer
02:41:06 that's not a real person ghost writer also known as josh scorcher the fiery joker
02:41:12 josh scorcher the pony reviewer who was in the military technically yeah because he scorched
02:41:19 he scorched palestinian children uh wait i just remembered this was the last thing i saw before

02:42:23 stamp it hey guys did you know that bronies are a bunch of losers and they probably are petafite
02:42:30 well i mean some of them oh i'm scrubbing through i'm seeing i'm seeing the phantom horn i'm seeing
02:42:36 the funny like uh tune critic discord or skype call remember that yeah you know i think it's a
02:42:45 lot of this is about that guy oh wait that there i am no wait you too is it in the analysis anarchy
02:42:52 just in an analysis anarchy like screenshot or whatever it's like give and take the the tf2 spy
02:42:58 facepalming yeah i i can't you know what i mean analysis anarchy is cringe it is terrible
02:43:06 yeah deserves to be made fun of so like what i can't even i can't i can't really complain
02:43:14 oh there's digi oh where oh god near the beginning like five minutes in um does he say anything
02:43:24 i'm not watching the video i'm just i'm just looking at the scrubbing through the the thing
02:43:29 seeing the little thumbnail that comes out i i don't think i would like i don't think i would
02:43:33 like this video i think turkey tom seems like kind of a bitch i know yeah i don't fuck the turkey
02:43:38 tom um so yeah it's just gonna be a lot of like tired things yeah i i think um i seen some turkey
02:43:49 tom but some of the recent ones have been like way better about like topics i don't believe it
02:43:55 i don't believe it but like his a bunch of like i've heard i keep hearing him say like
02:44:01 these bunch of little very stupid things all the time um he believes in the whole like twitter
02:44:07 being the public square so you shouldn't ban anyone off of it which is the most dumb ass take
02:44:13 ever heard it's funny how that's his take and he's a big destiny fan and that destiny is like
02:44:20 hate when people say that twitter's the public square and people shouldn't get banned off of
02:44:25 there turkey tom's a destiny fan oh yeah that destiny had been very popular with like reactionary
02:44:31 types recently yeah it makes makes sense um man what's what's the point i mean i'm okay this the
02:44:42 scandals of andrew tate uh roblox degenerates tarik nashid who who gives a shit man i i don't
02:44:52 care i don't like i don't like what i'm seeing um the disappearance of animated james how he makes
02:45:00 so many of these they must be terrible because he makes so many they must be awful yeah i mean
02:45:12 it's it's one of those things where he pumps out like an hour long video of week they can't possibly
02:45:18 be good i'm not i think there's something with like the subject matter being so negative like
02:45:27 exposing a terrible horrible thing and that's all the content creator does put a soyjack on a
02:45:33 roblox and then i'll talk about a bunch of how people oh really are people on roblox cringe
02:45:39 are there like pedophiles playing this children's game oh i can't tell me more educate me i mean
02:45:45 people tell me about the pedophiles there's there's there's another channel that i've seen that is
02:45:51 so like overtly like negative like this just sort of focusing on like the worst things ever
02:45:58 and that's all they make it's just like exposing this and exposing that and i'm like
02:46:04 sure you know exposing exposing things is like a good thing to do i guess but if it's your entire
02:46:12 brand and i just i'm just sort of put off hanging around there i don't like it
02:46:21 yeah this is a whole this is a whole type of channel
02:46:27 oh man they upload a podcast a week there's no they upload a three hour podcast every week
02:46:33 there's no way this is good there's just no way yeah that's right i wasn't being uh sarcastic
02:46:41 when i saw that was my my true opinion my true all right let's all right let's do voicemails
02:46:48 i've had enough i've had enough wait how many voicemails is it i don't know
02:46:55 let's go to speakpipe.com slash pcp voicemail and check out what we're looking at okay well in that
02:47:02 case i can't i can't stay for a while but i gotta go all right fair enough all right jeezy it's been
02:47:09 a pleasure bullying you uh it's it's it's it's fine it's fine but i i'm gonna prove you wrong
02:47:15 ben saying i'm gonna i'm gonna prove you wrong you're gonna come crawling he's gonna you're gonna
02:47:20 be coming to my knees coming to me oh come on your knees you'll come on my knees you'll be jerking

02:47:52 they should all right all right sweet all right later jeezy see yeah okay the first one is called
02:48:00 tldr how carbon offsetting works three two one go we should take the teeny bottom and push it somewhere
02:48:10 yep just push it i
02:48:21 next one is called winging about a oh my god
02:48:27 there's three emails and they're all over a minute long or voicemails
02:48:32 all right winging about a ir at part one three two one go
02:48:35 well it's already monday so i'm definitely missing the next episode recording uh which
02:48:43 has already happened by now but i just want to weigh in anyways on the whole a i art business
02:48:49 because the whole thing annoys me in general far too much to not open my big mouth so first of all
02:48:57 um it is not actually i think the main issue uh that a i art is plagiarism because that only invites
02:49:08 the counterargument like ben kind of uh intimated that um well artists also copy each other's styles
02:49:16 and if an ai is just doing it more efficiently then that is not really um plagiarism that is simply
02:49:22 well you know the artistic process as much as you can argue about whether or not that's true
02:49:28 like psychologically the real point is that it is wage theft and labor exploitation like a capitalist
02:49:37 factory owner who uses his laborers labor and the value that it generates in order to buy machines
02:49:45 that put them out of work the same shit happens to artists whose art is literally used to put them
02:49:51 out of work well yeah okay should i listen to part two yeah i i just think that like i agree with
02:50:06 this guy like it is wage theft i guess that's what i meant really when i meant plagiarism
02:50:12 like like the the problem with the plagiarism is that the artist will get less work because of a
02:50:17 machine the the problem is not trained to to come like to do their art can maybe make them lose work
02:50:26 and they didn't get the the permission to take that art and put it in the machine
02:50:31 yeah it's the the problem is not simply that it can well i'm not sure if this is even true but
02:50:40 if even if it were true that like the ai could just produce a better product than a human for less
02:50:46 money like that in and of itself would not be the problem uh the problem would be that it's doing it
02:50:54 yeah that it's doing it in a way that is uh it's basically stealing value from human artists
02:51:00 that created the the the work in the first place okay anyway part two three two one go
02:51:06 and then secondly uh as much as i agree with ben about the the idea that if something simply
02:51:13 becomes easier for people to do be it creative or otherwise productive that that's a good thing
02:51:21 in principle as much as i agree with that i do not think that ai quote unquote art is the actual
02:51:30 answer to that or is actually a good development because of that the reason being that ai art
02:51:37 eliminates like the most vital aspect of the artistic process and of what makes art valuable
02:51:45 in my eyes which is not in fact that it takes struggle or strife or pain uh and time to create it
02:51:52 but rather that it is created through an intentional process you know through both mental and physical
02:52:00 faculties that you know actually gives rise to a person's lived experience in a very tangible
02:52:10 and physical way that you can trace back to how they did it and appreciate that that's just
02:52:16 impossible with ai art it makes art into just product and it's shit it's garbage and i hate
02:52:23 sorry i agree again
02:52:29 um i remember the problem you had with like the show and tweet that it was like in your eyes um
02:52:37 uh glorifying hard labor for its own sake yeah and yeah i i think i think i think i was basically
02:52:49 saying the thing i said before that like the artistic process is valuable um in and of itself
02:52:57 the end product is like one thing but like making it is valuable for the person doing it and
02:53:05 in context of viewing it no wrong i don't agree at the end of the day product is all is all that's
02:53:15 left uh all all that is all that occurs as a result of the artistic process is a product
02:53:21 and anything else that you think about it when you look at it is just is just uh is just fan fiction
02:53:29 yeah but like like but like if it is fan fiction in the sense that like once the art is made
02:53:40 um you as the audience sort of create meaning from it however you interpret it yeah and i think
02:53:48 knowing that an art was made by a real person with purpose changes the context of how you
02:53:54 interpret it so it's valuable in that way it's at least at the very least variety because if
02:53:59 everything is made by computer you're like ah like you i think you would really just stop
02:54:06 feeling anything because you you can't relate to any person or any experience you just know
02:54:12 that a computer squished it together and maybe you like the look of it i think i see what you're
02:54:19 saying but i don't know imagine if you had like two identical paintings and one had been done
02:54:29 by an ai and one had been done by a human why why would why would the one done by the human
02:54:36 be better just because you know that a human did it i don't even think it's about better
02:54:42 i think it's just about variety i i think i i would rather live in a world where i can get
02:54:49 lots of different things from art rather than what ai essentially does which is like
02:54:56 like builds various like samey things or like weirdo things i like ai art that's like insane
02:55:03 that nobody would ever make because the computer doesn't know what is like expected of it i saw
02:55:09 i saw i saw a tweet this week that was like oh ai art doesn't understand doesn't understand
02:55:15 ramen did you see happen to see this tweet no well it was um it was four ai images and they
02:55:23 were things like the girl it was an anime girl eating ramen and in one like she was like eating
02:55:29 it with her hands like her she was grabbing noodles out of the bowl with her hands and in other ones
02:55:34 like her fingers like became the chopsticks that she was eating the noodles with and in other
02:55:38 ones like there were too many chopsticks like there were like four there was like a whole
02:55:42 like cluster of chopsticks in the hand that sort of became the noodles and then the fourth one
02:55:47 was a girl's like head in the noodle bowl and like her hair was the noodles and that was awesome
02:55:54 it looked so cool yeah it was great oh i i don't i don't ascribe like ai art equals bad stuff
02:56:02 it's it's merely the um i i i want like real art to continue to exist and in some ways this could
02:56:14 push artists away from you know being able to to live off their work and so less of it might exist
02:56:21 it's a lot of hypotheticals it just sort of it it it and creates a lot of like
02:56:27 like like this shitty future in my head okay but what's shitty about it
02:56:34 because it's all it would be all the same at some point well that just seems like a
02:56:41 that's sort of like a that's just a technical concern like what okay well what well what if
02:56:46 ai art were more advanced and it could create stuff that didn't all look the same which it
02:56:51 kind of it kind of already does i think um since ultimately i'm the one who decides how i feel
02:57:00 about something you would need to change my mind about how ai art appears to me for me to like
02:57:07 like be okay with a world exclusively of ai art that can completely like um like replace all human
02:57:15 art okay but who i who is the sort of thing who is saying that ai art should completely replace
02:57:22 human art no one but like that's the sort of thing that makes me dislike ai art on a like an
02:57:29 emotional visceral level i see things that are cool and then i see things that are like this is
02:57:36 not weird and wacky and ai aesthetic it's sort of like this looks like some human drew it like
02:57:42 a really good human artist even though their hands a bit fucked up but it's like i could see i've
02:57:46 seen paintings and drawings by people that look like this because they purposely made a thing
02:57:52 and now the ai art is so good at recreating human art that it doesn't have its own like flavor
02:57:57 anymore it's just sort of like doing human art instead of humans doing it and so i extrapolate
02:58:03 that idea further and it's like well what if all humans are pushed out of art somehow
02:58:10 i don't like that it just sort of they won't be i mean they won't be but why are you so sure they
02:58:17 won't be why why would they be i don't i don't get it i forget the point that we were arguing ai can
02:58:27 um i mean i mean look at what it's doing okay it can't like it can't but you you were the one
02:58:36 you said okay you're using you're using two you're using two separate arguments that are like
02:58:40 completely at cross purposes with each other on the one hand you're saying that ai art can't be
02:58:46 like human art because it lacks ideas and it's not original but on the other hand you're saying
02:58:53 but it would be bad it's bad ai bad because what if it replaces all human art but like
02:58:58 if one is true then the other can't be true i don't get it i don't know what you mean if ai
02:59:05 art does not replicate the kinds of creativity that human art is capable of then it's like
02:59:12 it will then then it will never replace human artists yeah but like i'm also saying that
02:59:21 the knowing that something is made by a computer changes how i feel about it
02:59:28 i mean i get that hypothetically if if all ai art um does replace human art like in
02:59:35 terms of quality or whatever you want a metric knowing that it's made by computer i will feel
02:59:40 bad there's it's just an emotional response when i hear that i think oh so you would be okay
02:59:50 with living in a future where all ai art where all art was generated by computers but they just
02:59:56 didn't tell you that that was true uh i guess hypothetically that could already be the case
03:00:02 so yeah right if i didn't know um it's like oh we're living in a simulation but nobody
03:00:11 you there's no proof you'll never find proof is like oh i guess i wouldn't feel any different
03:00:15 because i it could already be the case okay i mean yeah okay all right that's fair um i just i just
03:00:26 don't see it i just don't see my general point i don't i don't really see it replacing traditional
03:00:37 art sure yeah yeah i i don't i would want to live in a world where
03:00:45 uh there's not like this there's multiple like conclusion like like main points and i'm not really
03:00:51 like making anyone at the say at the at this like there's the there's the capitalism problem
03:00:58 people losing work that upsets me just generally i don't like the fact that some artists could
03:01:04 have their work wage stolen like their their labor taken without their consent put into a
03:01:10 machine and then the machine makes art that looks like their stuff that the machine operator or
03:01:15 whatever can profit from i or just or just like real lower the amount of profit that the artist
03:01:21 could make off of that same style that's one thing uh the other thing about like all i ai art
03:01:26 replacing human art is more of like a an existential sort of emotional response which is not really
03:01:32 related and then uh then the other thing is that i prefer i prefer ai art that looks like
03:01:40 a weird dream nightmare and i don't like ai art when it's just normal i prefer it when it's
03:01:46 fucked up because that's funny and cool yeah this girl's head in the ramen bowl you know i mean
03:01:52 i think a human could have drawn a human could have drawn something like this yeah you would just
03:01:56 never think to i mean they could but you know in this case you in this case an ai came up with it
03:02:03 and like you know good good for good for them good for the the ai i guess i like it um the labor
03:02:10 argument i mean yeah it's bad when people lose work but to me the like oh ai will cost artists
03:02:19 their jobs argument is an art is an argument against capitalism more than it's an argument
03:02:23 against ai in my opinion sure um as there are some people who wouldn't understand that but i
03:02:33 definitely understand it's an anti-capitalism position as as for it yeah as for it replacing
03:02:40 like as for ai art like becoming the norm it's i just don't i mean in i think it might
03:02:49 in certain applications where we like wouldn't notice the difference and if we don't notice the
03:02:57 difference then like i guess who cares i mean the line has been blurred in certain fields already
03:03:04 like textures in in like video game development yeah it used to be like photographs that you
03:03:10 would edit now like you can kind of just ai generate based on like a bunch of inputs google
03:03:19 images and then you can come up with things like that like simple things that you're not supposed
03:03:24 to look right at but they they're they're they're ways of like skipping ahead um in the process of
03:03:32 building something different or like uh you know you need a pose for a thing and you you want to
03:03:41 you get some inspiration you want to get some inspiration and you want the ai to generate some
03:03:45 like prototypes of a general like description instead of drawing them all yourself so the line
03:03:52 has been blurred already it's i don't know yeah yeah uh okay i think there's a there's a third part
03:04:01 so let's just let me just listen to the third part three two one go
03:04:16 okay i said i was gonna shut up but i thought of one more thing that might be important to say
03:04:21 before uh that has to be explained by other people so yes of course you can use ai uh
03:04:29 quote-unquote artists in a like not morally wrong full way like of course that's possible it's
03:04:36 possible with any technology but like that does involve like deeply changing both how it's how
03:04:43 like the ai works and is like made and how it is like employed so like of course like give kind
03:04:51 of mentions in this episode like you can use it for ideation you can use it for just like spitball
03:04:57 and ideas and then just making your own thing based on that uh you can just use it for that which is
03:05:02 fine and you can uh use it for like uh background purposes you know you can use it for at least
03:05:12 producing art when you really only mean to create a product i guess uh but then it's still a question
03:05:19 of first uh addressing the whole database issue and the issue of what data what art goes into it and
03:05:26 whether or not yeah i mean i agree with the and it's just morally dubious to try an art like the
03:05:32 art of consenting artists professional artists who's you know the intellectual property is being uh
03:05:40 robbed did you see there was like a different stable diffusion but from music but they they
03:05:48 they explicitly said we're not going to put copyrighted tracks in there because we don't
03:05:52 want the legal trouble which just goes to show that the music industry has ways of protecting
03:05:58 their artists but the art industry does not and so they feel totally fine with stealing art from
03:06:04 every artist who posts their stuff online but um they're scared legally of of what the music industry
03:06:12 could do to them so it's like very obviously a problem there yeah that that does speak to like
03:06:19 the fact that one is like more regulated than the other uh for sure hmm that's interesting
03:06:26 i forget the name it was like stable dance or something i didn't i did not see that but uh
03:06:37 should we should we have a i mean
03:06:47 okay but i mean i those are is that what are they gonna put like you know un unlicensed like sound
03:06:54 like random sound cloud musicians in there like who's probably whose music are they gonna put in
03:07:00 there that that's the thing it's like you know they're still they're still gonna steal the music
03:07:05 just not from anyone who can do anything about it that's like oh that's the track that fucking
03:07:11 i don't know who's a big studio atlantic records is the first thing comes to my head like oh they
03:07:16 take a fucking led zeppelin song put it in there and make something that sounds like led zeppelin
03:07:21 the lawyers involved will destroy the ai um company they'll be killed they'll be murdered
03:07:28 in their sleep can't do that hmm i mean i guess a similar thing would happen if like
03:07:39 an ai started producing images that like were provably derivative of like i don't know
03:07:47 dc comics image stuff i guess or if it like
03:07:56 made jokes in the style of saturday night live or something
03:08:03 we made an ai to steal jokes i saw a thread this is off topic but i saw a thread of um
03:08:11 it was from that twitter account called like weird medieval guys
03:08:16 yeah uh i saw a thread of like medieval jokes they sucked they were bad they had bad jokes back
03:08:26 then all of the jokes were like the punchline is like oh the priest had sex or like oh this woman
03:08:37 her husband had anal sex with her or like none of them none of them had like a punchline that was
03:08:46 like a subversion of expectations that was like set up in the joke all of their all of them had
03:08:52 a punchline that was like it was it was it was a merely a subversion of like social convention
03:08:58 like one of the jokes was literally like a guy said like oh i'm going down to the whorehouse and
03:09:05 the other one was like oh say hi to your mom for me and like that was literally the joke
03:09:13 that was a good one trap good good one you got him

03:10:18 retorted the boy for you will be sure to find yours there also this is dog shit this
03:10:27 i like it it's something it's something about it the sort of the flowery over explain over a
03:10:34 descriptive i would say boy is a good phrase i like frolicson i would say that this thread
03:10:40 is proof that the technology of humor has improved in in in the time since then we understand how to
03:10:47 construct jokes better these days uh it's ultimately it's just sort of like hey loser what are you

03:17:43 as a reference to mario paint cool cool uh next one is called is your stuff cool three two one go
03:17:52 you know it's a much better cancel culture just never use twitter and if you ever meet someone
03:17:58 who uses twitter cut them out of your life it's so much more fun cancelled culture than being on
03:18:03 twitter all the time i'll be a much more interesting person i came i i i actually was like seriously
03:18:10 considering like do i want to just delete my twitter account this week i really was thinking
03:18:14 like i kind of think that twitter just makes me a worse person and it makes everyone a worse person
03:18:18 and uh i i think i'd be better off without it true so i agree it is it is a dangerous drug
03:18:27 yeah it's not it's when it when it when you get on the wrong side of it and you use it
03:18:33 in the way that like just makes you mad all the time i mean yeah the the stand the standard
03:18:39 response of using twitter is just being mad all the time so that's great and then i mean
03:18:45 worst case scenario i saw someone made a tweet that was like uh twitter twitter is like when you
03:18:52 post a take on twitter it's like you're pulling a slot machine but you can only lose like the only
03:18:58 jackpot you can win is like everyone hates you uh so yeah next one's called wakame three two one go
03:19:10 what's your opinion on portal it's the best video game of all time in my opinion however i think
03:19:17 portal two sucks um this is like a conversation that's been had on the pcp before probably remember
03:19:26 portal two is fine there's some sort of discourse around like how portal two is oh was this the one
03:19:33 where we talked about like the original and how i said the original is better just by virtue of being
03:19:37 the original yeah something like that because it's yeah i still feel that way uh i like portal one
03:19:45 i think i i think i appreciate portal two just because it's more fun puzzles and i like puzzles
03:19:52 yeah i mean i think most of what's good about portal two is the same stuff that's good about
03:19:58 portal one uh like the the the new mechanics they added are are fine and and good and all
03:20:05 um but i don't really think they like improved that much on like the core formula of it
03:20:10 it's basically just more portal one so i wouldn't say that portal two sucks i don't think it sucks
03:20:18 it's fine nah um bands we clear reminder play delta room chapter two okay bands we clear reminder
03:20:25 catch up to one piece okay at this point they're not reminding you they're just sort of like
03:20:31 you don't even really think oh yeah i should do that you just see you see this again you're like
03:20:37 okay isn't uh isn't delta room chapter three out or am i crazy no not yet oh being worked on but
03:20:44 i don't know when it's coming out okay okay um
03:20:52 i will i will do both of these things at some point i promise you that much it will probably
03:20:57 not have anything to do with how often i'm reminded in the voicemails but i mean whatever
03:21:04 next one is called bayonetta three voice actors update three two one go
03:21:09 yeah i just you probably already know this but um with the bayonetta three voice actors
03:21:15 shit like it's sort of it sort of looks like she lied and shit and instead of being paid just four
03:21:23 thousand dollars flat it looks more like she wanted to be she was offered to be paid god damn it four
03:21:30 thousand dollars per session which looks to be about three to four to five different sessions
03:21:36 which comes out to a lot of money and that the actually the actual voice actors wanted uh around
03:21:43 six figures uh just for paying that and um so it so it looks like she was a little bit facetious
03:21:50 about that you probably already know this i just want to let you know um yeah and like in hindsight
03:21:56 thank you very much like you don't just get what jennifer hail is the actress for placing her in
03:22:01 spainetta you don't just sort of just come across jennifer hail money if you're not willing to pay
03:22:06 someone four thousand dollars flat so it looks like she actually is just being facetious not to
03:22:12 mention that uh i don't remember her name but facetious actresses like a total like huge turf
03:22:18 and like a like a thin blue lion type of deal um or something like that so yeah it seems like she was
03:22:25 sort of sort of lying about that trying to trying to use the fans saying to boycott the game even
03:22:31 though it was all bullshit anyway i'm gonna go jerk off to uh the last was part two uh sex scenes
03:22:37 so bye all right good boy smell um uh i did not hear about the like that she may have lied about
03:22:46 the number i did hear that she's a turf uh fuck it yeah i don't know i mean i just fuck it i mean
03:22:55 i'm not i'm she did ask the six figures you know what based um the everything after that is not based
03:23:02 yeah i mean uh people should be paid for their work that's good people should not be turf said
03:23:06 should not be thin blue line that's bad however those are two separate issues but uh yeah i don't
03:23:14 know i don't really care about bayonetta honestly uh so i don't give a shit about any of it
03:23:21 other than in general i think work should be compensated uh whatever fuck it not interested
03:23:28 next one is called the comic progress oh this is probably some more vinny stuff
03:23:35 ben saint ben saint in red yep true angrily posting on twitter it's angrily angrily angrily yeah
03:23:46 ew like you do you scalp yourself my scalp off did i oh did i say something about like um i might

03:26:21 oh my god a piggy pulled carriage yep error rari gave me a great deal
03:26:27 recall error rari's voicemails you know i remember there being a pig but i don't know
03:26:34 what is driving that wagon i think it's one of error rari's um twitter abominations
03:26:43 you know the art because she draws the like fucking insect monster people
03:26:50 oh is that what it is uh that's my best guess ladies first what was that besties first lol
03:26:58 thanks auto autotuned lol page five the rest of it will have to be done at work i've got way too
03:27:08 much overtime i need to pay bills so i can't prioritize it at home ambitious yeah wait a
03:27:16 minute on page four we're coming out of the main terminal but it's spelled like main the state
03:27:24 i don't know if that's intentional or not that's probably intentional it's pretty hard to misspell
03:27:31 main yeah i would think so um hell yeah i remember yeah error rari's voicemails they had
03:27:42 some of like weird characters with weird voices and the little bug thing is saying an autotuned
03:27:47 lol because of the weird voice oh yeah i genuinely can't remember the storyline
03:27:54 i was beware the bear was that how it started yeah i and then it evolved into like
03:28:02 some incomprehensible saga carriage i think there were piggies involved yeah probably i remember
03:28:10 all the details it's hard to remember all the details though uh okay well good good stuff good
03:28:17 stuff uh next voicemail is ben gibb name your favorite clown have cheesy judge you i couldn't
03:28:28 name any clowns for you it's when it comes to clowns i really know like i know of some there
03:28:37 was a very there was a pretty there was kind of a there was kind of a hot uh uh only fans clown girl
03:28:43 on twitter called bouncy clown so i guess i like her i feel like that big boobs i feel like that's
03:28:52 like but she's not a real clown she didn't go to clown code she's just she's just she's just pretending
03:28:58 to be a clown she just put on the makeup she's she's just wearing clown face she's just wearing
03:29:02 clown face and it's offensive like when i think of clowns in media i'm thinking of like characters
03:29:09 from stuff rather than like personas online and i'm remembering like that weird clown in the dream
03:29:17 in the brave little toaster movie but he's creepy and he's ugly and i don't like him so i don't know
03:29:23 if i have a favorite clown the best clown is oh wait gamsy but he's a juggalo there's not really
03:29:32 a clown i feel like juggalo's i feel like it counts quackered quacker jack from dark wing duck
03:29:41 obviously quacker jack from dark wing duck is the best i guess he's more of a jester are jester's
03:29:45 clowns does the joker count as a clown i feel like yeah i feel like yeah the joker is a clown
03:29:54 joker is pretty good um what other what other clowns what other clowns um
03:30:03 there's the clown from steven king's it which i haven't seen oh you oh you mean it
03:30:11 oh you mean the titular it yes it no his name is penny wise penis wise yeah um
03:30:25 that's it that's all i got quacker jack wait um uh z from cycloneals she's pretty good
03:30:35 clown oh yeah there's a lot in cyclone there's a lot of good clown designs in cycloneals
03:30:40 this is my favorite clown in cycloneals i like the one lady it would probably be z honestly
03:30:45 i like z's clown face yeah it's pretty pretty edgy pretty cool but there are a lot of like
03:30:51 background clowns i like dance that's that's all right that's a good one yeah i could probably go
03:30:58 through and pick out some good ones if i wanted to but i don't uh cycloneals is pretty high-grade
03:31:07 clown media i i feel like i feel like cycloneals deserve more attention than it got i feel like
03:31:16 it got like no fanfare at all and i feel like it deserved at least a little bit yeah it was it
03:31:22 was not bad it was i think just people assumed bad things for some reason yeah the the the the
03:31:32 disc the homestuck discourse has turned decidedly negative these days maybe that's just in the circles
03:31:38 that i'm in like i know i follow the i follow the homestuck hashtag on twitter like you know when
03:31:45 it says like um when they do like uh here's a topic you might be interested in you can click x
03:31:51 so just like okay we won't do it anymore i always click on a homestuck one because i want the
03:31:55 algorithm to show me pictures of homestuck as often as possible so i see fan art a lot
03:32:02 and fan trolls and stuff sometimes is brisker and that's great you know what i did that i did that
03:32:07 for mega man actually yeah i i got recommended a mega man tweet and i clicked like yes continue
03:32:13 to show me mega man stuff and i've been seeing mega man stuff so i mean i guess the system works
03:32:19 um yeah uh all the like youtubers that i'm aware of have nothing nice to say about homestuck and
03:32:28 like you know good for them i guess i don't know it's my favorite yeah i'll just keep saying that
03:32:35 because it's true it didn't change it's still the same comic i would i would i would i guess i would
03:32:40 consider myself kind of a homestuck defender even though i am like very much willing to admit that
03:32:47 like actually most of homestuck is bad objectively it's funny because like that was always the line
03:32:53 it was just sort of like you know homestuck's trash right and the homestuck fans like yeah
03:32:58 and they continue to enjoy it that was always like the the funny like thing you would say yeah
03:33:04 like i love my trash comic um well now i mean now that it's done we can look back and be like
03:33:13 yes in hindsight most of it sucks
03:33:21 sad but true um but it's still what's good what's good there is really good and worth
03:33:27 deserves respect um next one is an image let's let's look at it shall we
03:33:36 what is what is going on it's the pcp and there's mage in the middle
03:33:44 and mage is a huge brain and we are all huge brain we're all fucking around
03:33:53 and we're all dumb except for mage i guess that's me with the sonichu medallion
03:33:59 and the twitter and the patreon in your head oh it's all of us as um you know like the like no brain
03:34:06 soy no brain yeah yeah
03:34:12 i like that i'm the the one with the long neck you know that one and i gotta like i've got a
03:34:19 punk ducky oh oh yes the the long neck and the like gross like adam's apple
03:34:28 yeah yeah okay i you can't really tell because like your ducky is like covering up
03:34:34 the neck but yeah i see it i thought the neck was going around maybe it's my arm
03:34:42 yeah it reads as an arm holding it to me i guess i'll post this here in chat i wonder if this guy
03:34:49 knows that that mage drew uh like i asked mage to draw a riska a not a riska a a punk ducky image
03:34:58 he did yeah we never made it into a pillow though for some reason it was something i think something
03:35:05 would like i was there was a time when like this company was saying oh do a small video and we'll
03:35:11 give you a free uh thing ducky macro i'm like hey free shit and that's cool i never had a ducky macro
03:35:18 before so i got a couple from that and i wanted to do another one i wanted to do a custom one with
03:35:24 punk but then that they didn't respond to that one even though they did the same thing like i will do
03:35:30 a video and uh and you can have the the thing they just never sent the the part of the punk one
03:35:39 so mage drew that and i still have it but never turned into a pillow
03:35:43 hmm is is that digi as the bong why why does it have blue hair
03:35:51 does she have blue hair no well let's see there's not like that kind of blue ever
03:35:59 there's cult corona there's tom there's nate there's devu on her head i i nate nate torso
03:36:06 head is great it's actually like very very good i think that's probably the best one although i
03:36:11 i like munchies face munchies like screaming oh that's munchie yeah i think so
03:36:19 so silly these are good these are these are good i've never seen the the soy jacks that some of
03:36:26 these are based on but like it seems like they mostly are well i don't know i like it it's good
03:36:35 and i appreciate it let's move on to the next uh voicemail there's another image yeah hey hey
03:36:44 apple bloom going to the city that's fine just remember what granny said about them crime rates
03:36:50 never relax sis i get it racism racism racism big city racism
03:37:00 apple bloom remember we in the apple family are alpha males we're scared of big cities
03:37:10 won't even drive through them anymore crime rates are too high and so are taxes uh
03:37:20 next one last one is called we was poke tubers three two one go
03:37:25 hello ptp i was wondering do you think that pokemon scarlet and bile are gonna be good
03:37:35 no you think they're gonna be bad yes i was just thinking about how with the regional forms of
03:37:40 pokemon they never made one into a bug a type you know and i guess that kind of makes sense because
03:37:45 you can't like change the biology of something above why not but yeah why but now they're not
03:37:52 doing regional forms anymore they're they're doing two things one is they're doing like
03:37:57 if you if you saw wiggler no wiggle it wiggle it it's not diglett it just looks like daily but
03:38:03 it's an eel because you can't evolve into an eel from a mole and now they're gonna do that with
03:38:08 tentacle i to mark my fucking words they're gonna make tentacle into a bug type and it's not gonna
03:38:13 be tentacle it's gonna be some other shit um that's all i had to say i can't oh wait the other
03:38:21 the other thing they're doing is um future paradox and past paradox pokemon i'm gonna have i don't
03:38:27 know make of that way well um check out the pcp minecraft server that's all i wonder if i can
03:38:31 say it's got we got so much it it's really cool um come on down anyway have a nice day thank you i
03:38:40 love you and why that is true there's a lot of cool shit on the minecraft sir i know i have i have
03:38:47 not been uh we we we would we've been saying we should do another stream soon yeah and we will
03:38:55 i just uh finished my super video um what is it what is it about tentacle they're gonna
03:39:04 release he thinks he thinks they're gonna turn tentacle into a bug because of wiggler because
03:39:13 why did i i didn't make him think that because wiggler is not an evolution of diglett it's just
03:39:19 a completely different pokemon i guess i mean i mean the regional variants have always been
03:39:25 that like role picks ice version you can't evolve into a nine tails fire version yeah like it's
03:39:34 yeah yeah yeah like it's um a regional variant basically is its own pokemon
03:39:41 in all ways that matter i guess i would like a new i would like a bug tentacle
03:39:49 tentacle and tentacle are really cool designs or at least tentacle is i don't i don't really
03:39:55 understand what the like evidence for that claim is but i'll assume that it makes sense uh
03:40:05 oh did you see uh they're they're doing um first of all the game will not be good they
03:40:09 don't make good pokemon games anymore they're they're against sure that goes without saying yeah um
03:40:15 they're doing a they're no you're your your player no longer has a gender you don't like
03:40:20 pick boy or girl you just have your avatar and you can dress them boy way or girl way or whatever
03:40:27 yes i like that it's cool i think that's good i think i mean honestly even even in a even a even
03:40:34 in a non woke way right i just think that makes sense because like you have something the same
03:40:40 fucking model no matter what the like the base the base model of your character doesn't look any different
03:40:47 like you could just take the same uh a 3d model character and just give it different eyes different
03:40:53 hair just makes sense it's just it's just more it's more a sensible design why why do you have to
03:40:59 pick one it's it's more you could literally just change its hairstyle and like the difference
03:41:03 it's it's like same difference i think i'm i haven't played a pokemon game in a long time but i'm
03:41:10 pretty sure when you like in x and y or any other 3d ones uh the model between male and female is
03:41:17 more than just hair and stuff like is there like there are like different leg shapes and
03:41:23 noticeable breasts on the female ones because they're not like children unless they are are you
03:41:28 are you but are you talking about like the player character when you when you choose one or the other
03:41:33 that like the female one looks more feminine on a structural way in the 3d one too but yeah i think
03:41:39 so okay that might be true that might be true but i'm remembering like x and y doesn't need to be
03:41:45 the case at all no it doesn't yeah it it i mean it'd be cool if you could like you could like
03:41:53 change body parts as well but like that's a little too involved for a child's game i feel like you
03:41:59 could put um you would i don't think you'd need to change the the body i think you could just pick
03:42:05 different outfits and different outfits could just have different shapes that could sort of imply a
03:42:09 body shape underneath and like that would be basically the same so yeah to to to me yeah to
03:42:18 me it's just like it's just like cleaner design to just have a base character who is not you don't
03:42:25 have to like lock yourself into one of two sets you just have a base thing and you can just make
03:42:31 it you can just uh have it wear whatever you you want just makes more sense um
03:42:38 uh but the game will still be bad in spite of that so it doesn't matter
03:42:44 yeah um yeah i think that was the last voicemail well thank god all right
03:42:55 i got a little frustrated i got a little frustrated today i was a little bit mean to our
03:43:01 guest uh and you know what but he deserved it so it's fine um uh i'm i'm i'm uh i'm in a dark
03:43:11 place but it's okay uh uh once the video is done probably i'll feel better i'm in that i'm in that
03:43:18 stage of like i'm in that stage of like it's basically done and now if it's just like feel like
03:43:25 like a never-ending series of minutia to to to do before i can finally wash my hands of it
03:43:32 and it's very frustrating uh so maybe next week i'll be in a better mood uh
03:43:40 uh but hopefully not hopefully not hopefully hopefully yeah hopefully you'd be a good old
