00:00:00 I've been trying to get into beverages of all types. All shapes and sizes. Well, okay,
00:00:12 I guess beverages don't have any shape or size. They are liquid. But all types, you know.
00:00:19 As a child, I was really into milk, and I still am. But milk is like the thing I've
00:00:24 always been into. I always drink milk with every meal, pretty much. Very few things.
00:00:30 I don't think go best with milk, you know. Then when I was 16, I got into water. Didn't
00:00:36 like water before. But one time when I was 16, I got sick. And I felt better every time
00:00:41 I drank water. But then I stopped being sick and found out that water still makes you feel
00:00:46 better. So I did that. And then when I was a little bit older, I started getting into
00:00:52 tea because I often have a sore throat or an upset stomach. Partly because I think I
00:00:57 have like acid reflux, I think, because my dad has it. So I probably have some of that.
00:01:03 But a green tea cures sore throat and herbal tea, peppermint tea, sets your stomach. So
00:01:10 I just have herbal tea after like every meal. So I'm a big time tea guy. You know, then
00:01:15 I turned 21. I got into drinking a little bit. Then didn't really have anyone to drink
00:01:19 with though. But since moving here, I now have lots of people to drink with. So I've gotten
00:01:24 quite into that. Really gotten into white wine specifically. So easy to drink. It feels
00:01:30 all tasty. And then I get to have fun time. Yeah. And yeah, and I've also kind of been
00:01:38 into juice my whole life as well. You know, but sometimes I'll buy myself some juice. And
00:01:42 then I'll have that. So it's like, okay, you know, I drink water all the time. I always
00:01:46 have a cup of water with me. I drink milk with every meal. I drink tea after every meal.
00:01:51 And then sometimes just for the hell of it, I, you know, I drink alcohol sometimes. Sometimes
00:01:55 I just have a beer with me to get a little bit buzzed, you know, to focus my focus a
00:02:00 bit. And then, you know, I'll have the occasional cup of juice. I'm like, sweet. I'm into so
00:02:06 many beverages. Now one beverage I avoid is soda just because, like, you know, I'm not
00:02:13 a fan of the way it tastes. I've never really been into it. It just feels gross. And it
00:02:16 just feels like way too much sugar for me. And then of course, everyone says soda is
00:02:21 really unhealthy. So I'm like, okay, I will avoid it. I love soda. It gives me an opportunity
00:02:26 to feel so superior to normal civilization being like, Oh, that thing that everyone says
00:02:31 is bad for you. I don't even want it. I'm just naturally amazing. Although it sucks being
00:02:38 at a restaurant because, you know, most of the time the only thing you can get is soda
00:02:43 or sweet tea, which restaurants would serve milk. That'd be great. So yeah, I'm avoiding
00:02:48 soda and energy drinks. But then there's still one other beverage to get into, which is coffee.
00:02:56 Now growing up, I'd assume that coffee probably hurts your health or like slowly kills you
00:03:00 or something. Because I mean, if it gives you more energy, it must be taking away from
00:03:04 your life for us, right? But CGP Great has that whole video about how caffeine supposedly
00:03:09 doesn't have any negative side effects at all. So I'm like, Oh, I guess I'll get into
00:03:13 coffee at some point. So you know, like a year or two ago, occasionally I drink a cup
00:03:16 and I just didn't didn't really seem to have that much of an effect on me. So I would drink
00:03:20 like one cup every day. But then as the days went on, I just got more and more delirious,
00:03:24 not more energetic, just weird, like four days of coffee in a row. By the end of it, I was
00:03:30 just like running around me like, where am I? Who am I? I felt like someone could just
00:03:35 come up and stab me right through the chest. And I'd be like, you are stabbing me. I understand
00:03:40 you have attacked me. What is happening? Like I just felt like I just felt like numb to life
00:03:46 itself. So that was starting to be scary. So I held it off. But you know, nowadays, I really
00:03:52 just want to work super fast. I want to make videos super fast. I love I'm super romantically
00:03:58 into this idea of like sitting down and cranking some some project out in one session, right?
00:04:03 And I'm like, I can rarely do that without getting tired, at least at some point. So
00:04:08 I that coffee keeps sounding attractive to me. So I tried coffee the other day. And at
00:04:16 some point I started cataloging a timeline of how the day went. So I will now redo the
00:04:21 timeline. Okay, so I wake up, I believe at some point, I'm not quite sure on exactly the
00:04:27 time, but I woke up at some point. And did you had a video ready for me to edit? Like
00:04:30 he had recorded the audio for it and he linked me the script. So that's my cue to start making
00:04:36 it. But you know, I'll wait a couple hours before I get to it. So first, I, you know,
00:04:41 do some C++ tutorials again, you know, I'm still in decoding the stuff. And then I make
00:04:47 a six page list on a notebook listing off all of the must play video games that I haven't
00:04:54 played yet. So I do that. It takes me like two hours to write that down. Because I had
00:05:02 adapted it from a text document that I'd already made. But I wanted to get on a notebook and
00:05:06 tighten it up some so yeah, that took me two hours. Then I spent like two hours like watching
00:05:11 like, let's plays and summaries of some video games, you know, just to like, I was just curious
00:05:16 about it. So that was another two hours. Then I recorded a vlog about how many things I want
00:05:21 to do with my time with my life. I actually recorded that vlog twice. So that was basically
00:05:27 like a full hour I spent on that vlog. Then I sat down to get the log horizon video ready.
00:05:35 Before I can even make a video like that, I first have to convert all the files and stuff
00:05:39 to make it ready. Because when you download anime, it usually is an MKV file, but you
00:05:44 need to have an MP4. So you get a process of that. So I started that processing. Then
00:05:49 I spent like an hour or two like doing other stuff, uploading the video, the vlog. Then
00:05:55 I sat down to start making the log horizon video. And I got myself a cup of coffee. I
00:06:01 drank 500 milliliters of it like immediately, or two cups, right? So yeah, just this tall
00:06:08 stein filled with coffee. I drank the whole thing over the course of like probably 20
00:06:15 minutes. And I started very quickly feeling like total shit. I felt like all sickly and
00:06:22 gross and nihilistic as hell. And I started editing the video and I just, it wasn't even
00:06:29 feeling right. It felt like it was straight up making me not good at art. It made me feel
00:06:34 like I didn't even know what good clips it were in existence. I just felt like I'd lost
00:06:39 my touch even. So I just, I went away, I went into my room and started talking to a
00:06:45 squiggle. I have a squiggle now, and I talk to it sometimes. So, you know, started having
00:06:53 a conversation talking about how I feel like shit. And at some point, I'm like, all right,
00:06:59 better get back to this video. You know, started editing it again, kept working at it, feeling
00:07:04 weird. Ben comes into the room and I'm just like, Ben, what are you doing? Hey, I'm making
00:07:09 it. I'm trying coffee. I'm just feeling like a huge weird grumpy pants who doesn't even,
00:07:15 I didn't even feel like me anymore. So I'm just like hammering away at the video being
00:07:19 like, why doesn't this work on me? Why doesn't coffee work on me? Why doesn't coffee work?
00:07:25 Oh, it's been 10 hours. And then that's when I realized I had just been editing the video
00:07:31 for like all night long, nonstop, without even blinking, without even feeling slightly
00:07:37 tired. And I'm like, oh, this is where everything started to come together. Now, toward the end
00:07:48 of the video of making it, I started to almost pass out. I started to get totally dead tired.
00:07:52 So I'm like, oh, let's see if I can make this video in time. And so I finished the video
00:07:59 at 440pm. That's I'm able to calculate this because I can look at, you know, the file dates,
00:08:06 the dates of files. And I had made the video in about 11 hours straight. And I'm like,
00:08:13 yeah, sweet, it's a 10 minute video made in 11 hours. That's pretty fast. I was really
00:08:19 satisfied with that. And at this point, I somehow attained a second wind. I was no longer tired.
00:08:26 So I'm like, oh, so I go back into my room and talk to my squiggle some more, have this
00:08:31 huge dramatic conversation. Then I start singing a bunch of songs to the squiggle, like I just
00:08:37 play a bunch of music that I like, but but music where I've never actually looked up
00:08:41 the lyrics and I can't entirely sing along. So I learned some lyrics to some songs I like,
00:08:45 and I'm like, yeah, super satisfying. It's something I always want to do, but I never
00:08:48 take the time to do it. So then I go and wash some dishes in the kitchen and I make some
00:08:53 food for myself. Then me and Digi watch a movie together that we're planning on like
00:08:58 doing a video about. And it's a three hour movie. And over the course of it, I almost
00:09:03 passed out like a bunch of times. But then at some at some point, I somehow attain a
00:09:08 third wind. And the video ends, I mean, the movie ends and it's 10pm now. So I've been
00:09:14 awake for well over 24 hours at this point. I go into my room again, have a third intense
00:09:21 dramatic conversation with squiggle, like three conversations in one and one waking cycle
00:09:26 of mine. Then I talk to Digi about the movie some and we kind of are like, you know what,
00:09:32 let's not make a video about this movie. We changed our minds, but we talked about other
00:09:35 video project ideas. And then I start washing more dishes at around 1250am for 70 straight
00:09:44 minutes. So over the course of the next hour and 10 minutes, I finish washing all of the
00:09:49 dishes. And at this point, I'm like, how long have I been awake? So I go over and I look
00:09:54 at all the dates and the times of all the stuff on my computer. And I wrote out the
00:10:00 whole list of sequence of events that I've been reading to you so far. And that took
00:10:04 me like 30 minutes. So at this point, I'm like, okay, the power of this coffee so exponentially
00:10:11 outweighs that initial burst of anxious spiraling crumpiness that I have to drink coffee way
00:10:16 more often. And this was on only one cup. This is only one stein, a 500 milliliters
00:10:21 stein of coffee, approximately. I'm like, I still have so much energy. I'm not even
00:10:26 tired yet. I'm not even tired yet. So then I go and I do my laundry. Then I make some
00:10:31 more food. Then I then I relax for like three minutes, just laying on my bed and crushing
00:10:39 tiredness sweeps over me. So then I stand up and decide to brush my teeth. And then
00:10:45 suddenly the tiredness goes away. And I'm like, huh. So then I shower, shave, dry myself
00:10:54 off, and I rest for 15 minutes. So at this point, it's four 10am. I basically just rest
00:11:02 just so I can dry myself off more. I don't know. I can't even remember exactly. So it's
00:11:06 four 10am. I do the rest of the laundry. I do the rest of the laundry. So I've cleaned
00:11:12 so many things. I've cleaned all my clothes, all my frigging sheets, and all the towels
00:11:17 that everyone uses. And I put away all of the dishes too. I put away all the dishes once
00:11:25 they're all dried off. And it was the first time since living here that all the dishes
00:11:30 in my room in the house have been cleaned at this house. So it was an incredible moment.
00:11:36 And at this point, I'm wondering, I actually don't think I will become a coffee drinker
00:11:42 because I don't think I ever need to drink coffee again. I think that one cup was all
00:11:47 I needed. I've broken my sleeping mechanic. I've achieved the broken brilliance. I'll
00:11:52 never have to sleep again. Holy shit, this is the greatest thing. Then I start organizing
00:11:59 my room. Because, you know, my room was a mess. Halfway through, I start feeling bad
00:12:06 about it. I start feeling all down, crying for no reason. I guess just because I've been awake
00:12:11 for so long, I've become a weird bitch. So squiggle comforts me. I get back on the horse
00:12:18 and I finish organizing my room. And then I finish organizing my room at 8.40am. So it's
00:12:25 like, yeah, I'm moving slowly here. I am doing things slowly because I've been awake for so long
00:12:33 and I've become a weird, fragile person. But still, I was awake for about, for about like
00:12:40 44 hours. So just under two straight days of being awake. And it was this incredible moment of time.
00:12:47 And yeah, so that's interesting. I did fall asleep though. And I guess I'm probably just
00:12:53 gonna be randomly falling asleep all week. Anyway, I'm gonna try and talk softly here.
00:12:59 Hippo is asleep in my room on a inflatable mattress, six feet away from my microphone.
00:13:08 All the rad con guys are out there talking, probably shouting, screaming,
00:13:12 laughing. Don't know how much you guys can hear that. If you can, I'm sure it's totally
00:13:17 ruining the mood of this series. But you know, Hippo being a slave deer is forcing me to talk
00:13:23 softly. So hopefully that increases it. Or maybe makes it totally creepy. I don't know.
00:13:30 So yeah, you know, still doing the programming stuff. Still having a great time with that.
00:13:37 So cool. I have made a couple of like C++ programs. Mostly just stupid text things.
00:13:46 I'll put a link to them in the description so you can download them. If you use Windows,
00:13:52 they're simple exes. You know, it's just me to train myself and learn in programming stuff. But
00:13:59 I think I made a couple of funny little pieces of text. And you know, as I learned more and more
00:14:05 about programming, I immediately am taking the experience and knowledge I'd built up
00:14:11 in YouTube analysis to this new field. Because like there's one important thing that I've learned
00:14:17 as an analysis person and review person is that most people in any given field are not that good at
00:14:27 it, even among professionals. Because it's like I'm, I'm watching video tutorials about programming
00:14:34 and like lectures on the nature of programming. And I'm starting to get the sense of like,
00:14:38 how many of them are people who aren't really that good at what they do, but they are technically
00:14:44 professional. And like even, you know, comments and forum posts around the internet, and there's
00:14:48 people who like sound like they really know what they're doing. But you know, maybe they're they
00:14:53 know what they're doing, but what they're doing is garbage. So yeah, that's kind of, it's interesting.
00:15:00 Because you know, obviously, I literally don't know shit about it. But I'm already starting to
00:15:06 like get a feel for it, get a feel for like who the who are the people who I can respect are
00:15:11 in this situation. Because you know, with YouTube reviews, I mean, 90% of people I don't
00:15:18 wouldn't take seriously with their reviews, even if they are making money from it, even if they are,
00:15:23 even if they do have 100,000 subs and stuff, you know, like all the normal boots hidden block
00:15:28 people are people who I would not really go to for any wisdom on how to make videos, or telling
00:15:34 anyone to go to and learn from, except for like, basic production values and upload schedules,
00:15:43 and stuff like that. I mean, not counting Jean Tron, he's obviously a totally different animal
00:15:47 from everyone else in that field. But you know, so like, because the video that I'd mentioned
00:15:54 before about programming called object oriented programming is bad. I watched that video again,
00:15:59 and I watched its sequel videos, which are object oriented programming is embarrassing,
00:16:05 and object oriented programming is garbage. And it's like, man, this guy, Brian Will,
00:16:13 is smart. And I respect him deeply. He's so sure handed and, and just so subtly smugly derides other
00:16:24 other techniques and stuff, but like, just so just so competently, and, and clear headedly.
00:16:30 And I'd admit, he's really, really convinced me. And I know that a lot of I'm probably get a couple
00:16:37 comments being like, that are very like, sincere and like, well informed, telling me about, you're
00:16:43 like, well, I know he said this and this and this about object oriented programming, but you know,
00:16:48 this, this, this and this. And on one hand, I'm inclined to take you seriously because you know
00:16:54 more about comp coding than me. But on the other hand, I'm not like, I have to admit, like just
00:16:59 because you've you actually are a good programmer, I have to admit, I might not take you seriously.
00:17:06 I'm not, by the way, people who've commented before on the last one, I'm not referring to any of you.
00:17:13 I don't remember exactly. But I don't know, it's just it's just a weird thing,
00:17:17 feeling like I'm already judging people's skill at a field I have no skill in.
00:17:26 Yeah, I'm a pretty bad person. You know, it's funny, becoming successful in life has done
00:17:36 simultaneously good and bad things to my moral character. Because, you know, when I'm a depressed
00:17:42 teenager, I'm more inclined to lash out at people and be mad and grumpy. But now I'm not,
00:17:47 I don't really have any incentive to be grumpy at people. But I'm so satisfied with my self image
00:17:53 now that I don't care to not be grumpy to people, you know? I just like, I'm so satisfied and content
00:18:06 with what I've with the cool stuff I get to do all day, that I don't need the approval of people
00:18:14 at all. Like I'm someone who's rarely needed much approval from other people who I don't care about.
00:18:20 But that dependency is at an all time low with me, like I really don't give a shit.
00:18:28 So yeah, it's just, I feel like I've been becoming a weird asshole to people.
00:18:34 And I don't know, maybe I'll fix that at some point. I'll be like, you know what,
00:18:38 I'm gonna stop being an asshole this time. But I don't know. It's strange because
00:18:47 like, you know, I know Digi was saying similar stuff in one of his decompression chambers and
00:18:51 stuff like about, he doesn't think of himself as a great person. You know, he just thinks of
00:18:55 himself as maybe a strong five to a light six out of 10 on moral quality. I'd probably wreck
00:19:01 myself, you know, maybe a light to decent five, depending on who you are, how I'm treating you
00:19:09 specifically. But like, I feel like this is gonna be weird, but I'm sure almost, I'm sure there's
00:19:16 a lot of people who are gonna agree, but never really thought that they should say it, which is,
00:19:22 I value interesting people more than good people in the world. I mean, obviously, the more good
00:19:28 people the better. But I kind of just don't care. Like if someone is a great moral person who helps
00:19:35 people, I'm like, yes, I appreciate you. But you're not really doing anything to help me,
00:19:40 since I don't have cancer. I don't have being a starving African child disease. So you go off
00:19:48 and help them. That's great. You know, like, you know, at some point, if I ever have like,
00:19:55 if the time is right, maybe I'll do something to help you, you know, I do think you are valuable.
00:19:59 But I don't care, because you don't do anything that amuses me, you know, you're off in Africa
00:20:05 helping them, you know, I'm over here, you're not doing anything for me. So I don't really care,
00:20:10 you know, people who are interesting, educated and creative, and people who I can respect is
00:20:18 something that I want, that I want from people way more, you know, those are the kind of people
00:20:22 who I want to talk to or, or understand or research or that kind of stuff, you know.
00:20:30 Like all my life, all I've really wanted is just respect from people who I respect,
00:20:37 you know, like fame is cool and all, you know, people knowing about you is fine, although kind
00:20:44 of annoying too. But really, all I've wanted is just to be someone who is mentioned in a
00:20:52 retrospective of what was important about the world, you know, like this person came along,
00:20:58 took influence from these people who came before him, and then these people took influence from
00:21:03 him in this way. That's where I want to, that's, that's, that's my goal, man, that's, that's who I
00:21:09 want to be. But you know, I guess if you're a more nice person than you can be more respectable to,
00:21:19 that would probably help. I don't know, maybe, I don't know if I'm either underselling or
00:21:24 overselling the amount of assholeness I am. Guess that's for other people to judge.
00:21:30 Mwamp. Mwamp, that's a, that's supposed to be a horn sound, like mwamp, mwamp, mwamp.
00:21:37 Sometimes I'll type it in a chat, like someone will talk about something that was like derpy,
00:21:42 and I'll be like m-w-a-h-m-p, and they're like, wamp, what does that mean? I'm like, it's a freaking
00:21:48 horn, man. You know, when I started doing the programming stuff, I brought a chair back into
00:21:57 this room, and I started sitting at a chair. But it started to make my back hurt. After two weeks,
00:22:06 my back started to die. So I kind of gave up on that. I mean, I am sitting on a chair right now,
00:22:13 but I'm leaning forward. I'm not leaning back on the chair. That's what kills your back, slowly.
00:22:24 You know, I had mentioned before how I really liked the idea of making a video super fast,
00:22:30 which is what I did, you know, a 10-minute video in 11 hours. I'm really, really satisfied with that.
00:22:36 But it's really because making videos is harder than a lot of other mediums in a way,
00:22:43 where I could sit down and start drawing and just never stop, or I could sit down and make a video
00:22:49 game, or at least try to, and just never stop, you know? When I got into C++, I was like, wow,
00:22:56 I can just go at this all day with no breaks, or at least very, very few.
00:23:06 Whereas with editing video, it just feels like I have the need to get up
00:23:13 and do something all the time. I always feel at risk of getting distracted.
00:23:20 And it's strange. It feels like my work ethic is entirely different depending on what medium I'm
00:23:28 working in, and I've been trying to get to the bottom of that. And I feel like I've made some
00:23:33 progress on figuring it out. But okay, let's say there's two categories here. One category is
00:23:43 sort of a more abstract form of art, which is like you're drawing something that doesn't exist,
00:23:49 you're programming a video game, you know, which is entirely a simulation, or you're doing like this
00:23:55 more hard media stuff, where it's more high art in a way, where everything you're making is totally
00:24:02 purely created by your own hand. Then on the other side, there's more abstract, no, no, there's more
00:24:11 remix type of art, which, you know, editing videos is that you're taking this show that's
00:24:19 been made by someone else, and turning it into a different form, you know, you're re-editing it
00:24:26 into your own video. And also in this category, I would even put blog writing, like even the
00:24:34 process of writing a video like that. It's like you're taking the things that have been said in
00:24:40 this show, and then you're reinterpreting its meaning and its message and making it your own.
00:24:45 So even the writing process is very much like a remix of the writing of the thing.
00:24:52 And like even if you're blogging, like say you're just doing journalism, you know, that's also an
00:24:56 art form, but you're basically remixing life that way. So those are the two categories, right?
00:25:04 And I feel like the first category, the more high art, I'm not saying it's better necessarily,
00:25:09 it's just it's more, I'm just gonna use the word high because it just feels like the right word
00:25:13 to use, okay? Don't judge me. No, please judge me. But those mediums, it feels like it takes more of
00:25:21 my focus, it takes more of my, it takes all of me, you know, to make something like that, to draw a
00:25:28 thing, takes all of my soul, and the whole world around me doesn't matter anymore. Everything goes
00:25:35 black around me. And it's just me and my friggin' chisel and my chunk of stone and I'm making the
00:25:42 thing chiseling away at it until it's done and nothing can slow me down. Meanwhile with editing,
00:25:50 like a lot of the, of editing and making videos like that depends on like being culturally aware,
00:25:56 you know? That's a, that's a medium that's very much about like feeling connected to the
00:26:01 life stream of the culture around you, you know? You have to feel the world at all times
00:26:10 in order to like be good at it. So I, like, I can't phase out the world around me. I become more
00:26:15 one with the world around me. And when you're in that state of mind, you just get distracted more
00:26:21 easily. Or at least, I say you, but I mean me, okay? Like, yeah, the whole time I've been making videos,
00:26:31 it's like, you have to take breaks. You have to hang out on the internet in order to like be in
00:26:37 the right mental state to be able to make a video like that. And I don't know why that is.
00:26:44 Because back when I was making that RPG, I could just, I could just shut myself out from the world
00:26:49 completely and never lose my touch, or at least I felt that way, you know? So that's a weird thing
00:26:54 like that. And that's, and that's why it's harder for me to stay focused when editing videos.
00:27:01 Hopefully coffee will be my life hack to win the world. I will destroy everything with my new
00:27:09 don't need sleep power up. You know, I've always said I like the idea of sleep and I do find sleep
00:27:15 very satisfying. I just wish I didn't have to do nearly as much of it as I do. If it could be,
00:27:22 you go to sleep once every two to three days for three to five hours, that'd be ideal. No,
00:27:28 I don't know if that's medically possible, but if it were, that would be my favorite.
00:27:38 Well, that's, that's everything I had to say. I think it's been like a week since the last
00:27:44 episode of this show. So how about I just release it now? You know, it's only 30 minutes, but
00:27:50 that's what I'm going to do. Yeah. By the way, I'm going to change the titling system for this show.
00:28:00 Originally, I named the first episode like January or whatever, you know, gave it to date.
00:28:07 And then Nate came out with his solo podcast and also gave it a date. And did you was like,
00:28:12 actually, I was thinking you guys should just not have dates because that just gets confusing.
00:28:16 We can't have too many shows that are named after a date. That's just confusing. And I'm like,
00:28:22 I don't really know why, but okay, I might as well. So I think I'm just going to name these
00:28:27 episodes is like give them a title named after what I'm talking about. Not sure. I don't know what
00:28:34 I'm going to do about that. But yeah. Anyway, I got copyright detected on the song I'm using
00:28:46 on the last episode. But that may just be because I played two straight minutes of the song
00:28:54 with no talking over it. So I'm going to find out if I'm still going to get copyright detected,
00:29:00 even if I don't do the fade out. So yeah, unfortunately, this video is not going to end
00:29:06 with two straight minutes of just music, even though I really like that concept. So goodbye.
