00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:08 the best guy ever. And we've got Tom Oliver. I'm here, the Pokemon master forever. That's
00:00:16 me. Indeed, we got Mage. I lied, I'm here again, still this year. Hello. Oh yeah, that's
00:00:23 right. How unfortunate. Gibbontake is right around the corner here. Oh, it's not Gibbontake,
00:00:31 it's me, Endless Jess. I'm back from popular demand. Oh, finally. Our shitty commenters
00:00:37 will be so happy. I'm so fucking cool. Speaking of shitty commenters, there's Ben Saint everywhere.
00:00:46 Communists, the communists. You know that song? It's a good song. I do, Neutral Milk. Good old
00:00:54 Neutral Milk. Did you see that Endless Jess met ICP? Yes, on Instagram. I saw that picture
00:01:03 of the uploaded. The man. I don't know the situation, like what leading up to it. I really
00:01:09 would like him to be online at all so we could talk about it, because it's really cool. Yeah,
00:01:16 I would love to hear the story behind that. I mean, he probably just went to a show where
00:01:19 they were and then, you know, they're not like A-list celebrities, so they probably mingle
00:01:23 a little bit. Apparently you had like a bunch of his raps on like a thing and he gave it
00:01:30 to them. Oh yeah, that's it. I hope they collab in an epic way. God, can you imagine the world
00:01:37 would implode? Because it's just too good. I still remember. I'm sure everyone remembers
00:01:41 this, but the legendary video, oh shit, what's the name? Violent J, the big fat one. Mike,
00:01:48 Mad Mike, I can't remember. Mike Matta, I think that's it. That guy did with his daughter Who's
00:01:58 a Furry, that video about what was like Snake Catchers or Snake Wranglers, because someone
00:02:04 had produced a shittily, a shittily produced fursuit that his daughter bought. I thought
00:02:09 Violent J was the big guy. I could be wrong. That might be Violent J. Is this a sweet bro
00:02:14 and hella Jeff situation where I thought sweet bro was the guy in red the whole time? Or
00:02:19 no, the grand mother? That was very confusing for a while. In any case, they made this video,
00:02:24 I'm sure we can find it, where he and his daughter made a video together. His daughter
00:02:28 is a Furry and had it in fursuit the entire time and was talking shit about a fursuit
00:02:36 manufacturer who sent them a fursuit of dubious quality.
00:02:40 Yeah, I remember seeing that. That was, it was adorable. It is adorable. Don't fuck with
00:02:46 my daughter or he didn't say fuck. Don't fuck my daughter. It's just sort of like standing
00:02:53 up for his girl. This is really cute. I vaguely remember that. That was a while ago,
00:03:00 wasn't it? I mean, that was years ago that was made, but it keeps popping up recently.
00:03:05 That's an evergreen content for sure. My mind is very much at end of the decade, like what
00:03:12 are the pinnacle moments? What are the hinges upon which the decade turned? And I think the
00:03:15 release of that video was absolutely one of them. There was a big change in the world
00:03:20 when that happened. The Furry's and the Juggle is united and there was no stopping them
00:03:23 once they combined their forces. Indeed. The lowest dregs of society, finally combining
00:03:29 their power, becoming a force we can no longer ignore.
00:03:32 Hey, watch it. Those aren't the lowest. We can go lower. We can go lower.
00:03:38 As the decade progressed, we learned that, but at the time, we thought we'd hit the
00:03:42 bottom of the barrel. Guys, please, you're worse than this. This
00:03:47 is above you. You can do worse, I believe it. So speaking of worse, are you guys feeling
00:03:52 much Christmas spirit yet? Are you feeling getting gifts and whatnot?
00:03:57 Oh, I haven't got anything for anyone. I'm so poor. Christmas just causes me stress.
00:04:03 I'm just like, am I a bad friend or am I a broke friend? I guess I'm going to find out too.
00:04:09 Why not both? Yeah, you know. I mean, once I know the rules.
00:04:14 You are an art friend, so you can do art for people instead.
00:04:17 Yeah. The tragic reality is, I mean, Ben and I had this agreement from a long time ago
00:04:25 that we wouldn't buy to the gifts just to cancel it out, which is fine, and I stand by.
00:04:29 But unfortunately, Michelle went ahead and bought things for Ben, so I mean, I don't
00:04:34 know if we count as one individual or not, but...
00:04:36 Fucking it all up. Yeah, she's really fucked it. Although I did buy something recent,
00:04:41 I think I might give it to Grace because I didn't realize it had already been gotten
00:04:44 for Ben, but I did find something very nice that I think would be very enjoyable for someone,
00:04:49 some lucky boy or girl out of the Crimson Street. I still want to buy a Christmas tree
00:04:54 for my apartment here. You still haven't bought one? Hurry Nate,
00:04:57 stand's running out. No, I don't believe it. Today might be the
00:05:00 day. We're going to go out shopping after we record those to do some...
00:05:04 Send pictures. Sure, sure, if we get that set up. Although,
00:05:07 the one thing I'm worried about is Sessho destroying it and ripping it to shreds.
00:05:10 Yeah, that's always good. We might need to buy a table or something
00:05:13 to put it on so we can't reach it. Just the other day, he somehow reached a loaf of bread
00:05:20 on a table that he is not tall enough to reach, so it must be he was dangling over the side
00:05:24 or something, and that loaf was no more when he got his hands on it, and I'll never forgive
00:05:31 him for that. Oh, I thought you meant Sessho was no more.
00:05:34 Oh, yes. As a result of his betrayal. Don't touch my bread.
00:05:40 Speaking of Christmas trees, I want to show you guys my friend's Christmas tree. She found
00:05:45 like some light bulbs, like ancient lights in her parents' house, I think, or something
00:05:51 like that, or aunt's house, and she plugged it in, and this is how her room looked.
00:05:56 Whoa, that's a powerful light. That is magecore.
00:06:00 Yeah, she said she's not going to use the lights because it blinded her, but I was like,
00:06:07 What a coward.
00:06:08 If only she could give it to me because I want those lights.
00:06:11 I like it. I like it.
00:06:13 You know, the glow is like 90% or like 99% of the Christmas spirit is just seeing things
00:06:19 illuminated by colored light rather than white light.
00:06:22 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
00:06:23 Like I have some blue lights in the dining room, and it just changes the atmosphere so
00:06:28 much. It's like cool blue lights twinkling, twinkling.
00:06:32 I want twinkling twangly lights. I want glittery lights. I want glitter. I want, I want, I
00:06:37 like Christmas. It's so pretty.
00:06:39 I also love it. Driving down the street now and just seeing the Christmas lights on houses
00:06:44 and trees out front, it does a lot to bolster my spirit.
00:06:48 It's fairly epic.
00:06:50 My neighbors are decorating their balconies with twinkly lights, and they have put their
00:06:55 Christmas trees on their balconies, and it's just so pretty.
00:06:58 And I'm like, Oh, look at that. Oh, a new one. Hey, better look, a new one.
00:07:02 You know, I think there's a thing. As a young man, I never understood this, but I think that,
00:07:06 like, OK, engaging in these kind of cultural activities does take more than zero effort.
00:07:12 But the benefit is that it just gives you a stat buff of intelligence and wisdom and
00:07:18 dexterity.
00:07:19 Does it?
00:07:20 Yes.
00:07:21 I think so.
00:07:22 Well, it's worth it.
00:07:23 It's a peer pressure buff.
00:07:24 Like, it's not like you can put up Christmas decorations any time of the year and get the
00:07:29 same feeling. You have to be one with many.
00:07:33 So I should expend a few bucks, get that tree, buy a couple of ornaments, set it up, and it'll
00:07:37 just make life nicer for me. I've got, it's 10 days till Christmas or so, so that's, and
00:07:41 now I'm sure we'll have it up for a while afterward. I was even thinking of there's
00:07:44 like a railing up to my apartment. I was thinking of buying a set of Christmas lights and just
00:07:48 winding it around the railing up there. Oh, I bet that'd be nice. Maybe I'll do that.
00:07:53 How much is a Christmas light set? Like less than $10? That's worth like less than $10 to
00:07:58 do something like that.
00:08:00 I don't know. I've always just used whatever lights we have from many, many years ago.
00:08:06 Oh, I remember the lights from my family Christmas tree. They haven't been used in a while, I
00:08:12 don't think, because mom always comes over to the UK. So I think for grandma, they set
00:08:18 up like a mini Christmas tree nowadays. I wonder, yeah, yeah, they give you all the,
00:08:22 you know, you know, it used to, in Lithuania at least, they used to have like, not like the
00:08:27 ornaments for the Christmas tree. They're now like round balls nowadays, but like, they
00:08:31 used to be like very different shapes. Like I remember there was like a squirrel and like
00:08:35 a pine cone and like, like a little Santa Claus, stuff like that. They're really, really
00:08:41 detailed and really pretty ones and really colorful ones. I'm really, I'm really sad.
00:08:45 They all standardized to just make round balls. I mean, it's easier now, but I kind of miss
00:08:49 those decorations.
00:08:50 Yeah, that's fair. My parents have got like a bunch of old fashioned, like, you know, like
00:08:55 pine cones and like gold snowflakes with glitter and ornaments, like a tiny wooden train on a
00:09:02 string, all that sort of stuff. Ye old chisel Santa Claus, back when he didn't have a computer.
00:09:12 We, I remember finally the setting up the Christmas tree in my house with my folks. And I'm
00:09:19 looking forward to going to going to spend a couple of days around Christmas at the fam's
00:09:23 place. It's going to be nice. I haven't seen those guys in a while. It's probably been, I
00:09:28 guess not a full year since I was last home, but, but it's good. It's always enjoyable. And for my
00:09:33 main Christmas present that I asked for my parents, I just asked guys, please just help me
00:09:38 pay for my ticket because I don't care about anything. I just want to not lose as much money
00:09:43 every month as I have been.
00:09:45 I need to justify seeing you all financially. So just pay for the trips. I don't have to be
00:09:49 burdened with coming to see you. Yeah. And plus me being there, sharing my sparkling
00:09:53 personality with them is the gift that they really want anyway. Exactly, mage. Well said.
00:10:03 Any, anything exciting happening around Christmas? Anybody doing anything exciting?
00:10:08 Absolutely not. Yeah. You know, I was, I was going to say like the whole Christmas spirit thing.
00:10:14 I've been feeling it less and less every year. There was a few years ago where I was like, oh,
00:10:18 no, I'm jaded and I'm not like giddy about the idea of stuff. But I think it's like,
00:10:29 I don't worry about that so much anymore. Like, yeah, it's just fine. It's just, it's just another
00:10:34 day, another month in the year, but it's just a little, you know, you do a little thing. It's
00:10:38 like, it's not a big deal, but I've gotten over the fact that it's no longer a big deal.
00:10:44 Yes. I feel more or less similarly. I, for me, I just like visiting my family since I don't see
00:10:49 them very often. And, and this year, this year, I'm super excited because I'm actually getting
00:10:54 like a really good gift for my, for my dad. And I'm really excited to see my dad happy
00:10:59 because my dad is very, very stoic and he did like rarely smiles or just, just like talks
00:11:04 so much or anything. So like, I want to share with us what it is. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So like,
00:11:09 so I got a new computer, but my old computer is still fine. And my dad's computer is ass. So I,
00:11:16 I, I, I delivered to my sister, my old computer. And before I delivered it, I, I, you know, I
00:11:23 completely wiped my computer and I installed a very, very, very legal steam not required
00:11:30 like a copy of doom because, because I think I told you before that me and my dad bonded over
00:11:36 doom when I was so, so I got him that. And yeah. And it's shipped over. And like his old computer
00:11:43 can't run any games. Like it's just so ass. Like, like the way he has, he has to turn on the computer
00:11:49 is to connect two wires together. That's how bad the computer is. This is like a fucking Apple
00:11:54 two or something. Jesus Christ. It's just, it's awful. So I'm really excited to get him like a
00:12:00 really good computer. Like, because my old computer, it was still good, but the thing is,
00:12:03 because I used it so much, it would sometimes crash for me. And it had some other problems
00:12:10 here and there, but I don't think my dad will face these issues. No, no, no, they will. I don't
00:12:14 think he will face those issues because he actually doesn't play that many games. All he
00:12:18 uses this computer to watch movies. And my computer is fine when I'm just watching stuff. And, you
00:12:24 know, see, yeah, I mean, just as Gib was saying, I think as you get older, we're all adults now
00:12:29 and we're running our own lives mostly. Now that we're older, it's, it's not about getting the
00:12:33 stuff anymore. Now it's just about the experience of spending time with folks, not worrying about
00:12:37 shit. And yeah, that's what I'm just happy. I'm finally able to give gifts this year.
00:12:44 That is nice. I'm prepared. Like my family was like, oh, you know what, we decided not to give
00:12:49 gifts. I'm like, yeah, okay, sure. And I'm sending gifts. It's like, surprise. I don't want anything
00:12:57 from them. I don't really need anything from them. I just, I just, I just want to give gifts and see
00:13:02 them happy again. You know, I don't know if you guys feel, I assume, I get the vibe that most of
00:13:07 you guys feel similarly, but like, I have a very set, I have a very select set of rules as to who
00:13:12 I'm required to give gifts to every season. And anyone outside that bubble, like all you guys,
00:13:17 you're getting nothing. I don't give a fuck. I don't care. My friends get nothing. My obligatory
00:13:22 family members, I'm forced to buy them things. And I'm almost, I almost appreciate being forced
00:13:28 to give them something because then it's like, you know, whatever, we all feel happy giving
00:13:32 gifts is nice, et cetera, et cetera. But I will, I'll, I'll never go like outside of the people I
00:13:37 have to give gifts to, which is weird. Cause like Michelle, for example, she just like gives gifts
00:13:43 to friends. And every time she bought, I'm like, this is so baffling to me that you would choose
00:13:48 to engage in commerce for no purpose other than to give that thing away to someone else.
00:13:53 Well, some people have these weird things called feelings and don't understand it at all,
00:13:59 make them do things that seem on the surface irrational, but aren't actually,
00:14:04 there's got to be a game being played here. She gets a dose of what's it dopamine?
00:14:12 It's a dopamine spike. Yeah. Yeah, it's also just, yeah, that's it.
00:14:19 Pretty much, pretty much. Well, it's degeneracy and I don't condone it.
00:14:22 If I had actual disposable income, I would get gifts for people.
00:14:27 Back in the day when I had a decent amount of money, I got my family and like some of my friends
00:14:34 like fucking stacked gifts. I'm just like, yeah, I got money. Let's do it. Let's get some actual
00:14:39 dope shit. And it felt like I was a God because I, I, I engendered, I engendered favors, you know,
00:14:46 subtly, subtly, because it's just like, I've done this great thing and you did not meet my level.
00:14:50 So now you feel obligated to return the favor at some point in the future.
00:14:55 That was not why I did it, but it is a convenient side effect.
00:14:59 Indeed, it is. And that is a good thing to do. But I mean, the best situation of all is when
00:15:03 you can get like a meaningful or really good gift that still isn't worth a lot of money.
00:15:08 Like I think this was actually for my dad's birthday years ago. I think it was my idea.
00:15:12 It might have been my mom's, but in any case, I think that me and like, I think Ben and Grace
00:15:17 and also my mom, maybe like split this with me. What we got was just like a ticket for my dad
00:15:23 to go to like a, like a racetrack and race like a Maserati or like a Ferrari or something.
00:15:29 And he would just like get to drive it around a track for a couple of laps or something.
00:15:32 It was like an event that like people were doing. And he was, he, he very much enjoyed that one.
00:15:37 So that, uh, like by breaking it down so that I think we all paid for a piece of this, it wasn't
00:15:42 that bad. Yeah. Me and my dad, uh, from her, uh, from his mother, uh, received one year tickets
00:15:48 to the play cats. And that was a cool experience. I really liked it. I really enjoyed it. I
00:15:52 haven't been to a play. Was that performed by me by any chance and my high school performance
00:15:56 of cats? Is that the one? No, no, it was, it was like in London or something. Yeah, I was in London.
00:16:01 It was really cool. It was great. I loved it. And I, and I, and I said, we should, we should go
00:16:06 again to a different place sometime. And we never went since. Dogs. Yes, dogs. The much maligned
00:16:14 sequel. Uh, yeah, but that, that, that also, because I saw the, the play now I'm sort of like
00:16:19 excited, sort of scared for that movie coming out, the cats movie. Have you? Well, I mean,
00:16:23 it looks terrible. It looks very weird. Yes. But I mean, maybe the songs are good.
00:16:30 The songs are good. They're always good, but they are the same songs from the musical that
00:16:33 we've all heard a thousand times. Memory. All alone in the moonlight. Yeah, I heard it. I've
00:16:39 heard that song. Enough movie. Enough. Never enough of that song. I don't want any more memories
00:16:46 of the song. Thank you very much. Back to Christmas though. I, yeah, I usually just give gifts to,
00:16:54 to my parents and like, maybe I draw something for my friends. If I have the time sadly this year,
00:16:59 I don't have much of a time, but it's not like they give me gifts back anyway. So, you know, it's
00:17:03 fine. I'm not obligated, but there's this one friend that I really desperately wish I could
00:17:08 give a gift. And the only gift I really want to give her is a switch, because I would buy her a
00:17:13 game, but her laptop absolutely sucks and she can't play many games on it. And we, the way we
00:17:19 met with this friend, it was, we kind of bonded over Pokemon and she, she can't get Pokemon,
00:17:25 you know, this gen Pokemon, even though she kind of wants to. And I doubt she'll get a switch
00:17:31 anytime soon or just like ever because of her income. You know, she's also like one of the,
00:17:36 like her only income is art. And she's a really good artist. She's so much, so much more talented
00:17:41 than I will ever be. But like, she doesn't earn enough to afford a switch or to justify a switch
00:17:50 until like it goes on sale, which will be never. So I just like, I really wish I could afford to
00:17:56 get her switch, even a switch like just something for her to play Pokemon on just just because
00:18:00 just I want her to be happy and play Pokemon. That's all I want.
00:18:04 Just a thought, is it possible to perhaps split the cost with other like-minded friends who might
00:18:08 want to invest? We don't really have, I guess we have one friend in common, but I don't think it's
00:18:14 possible. The other friend we have in common, she kind of has a family and a child and stuff,
00:18:18 so I don't really feel good about asking her to spend a lot of money on a thing.
00:18:23 Fair enough, fair enough.
00:18:26 Well, no Christmas for them, I guess. They don't get anything.
00:18:30 Fair off the hook.
00:18:32 I'm tempted to just like send her some money for her savings at least.
00:18:40 Well, that's not the worst thing in the world. You could even say like for the switch fund or
00:18:44 something. I don't know, things like that. I remember, I think a couple Christmases ago-
00:18:48 You should get her just the game and no switch.
00:18:52 Pressure her.
00:18:53 Pressure her, so enforce her to spend her own money.
00:18:55 Here's Pokemon. Wouldn't it be great if you could play it with me?
00:18:59 Yeah. Nudge, nudge, asshole.
00:19:02 Here's Pokemon to play and you see here like sewing like little dresses to put around the
00:19:06 cartridge of like Pokemon Sun and Moon, like little tea sets where she can set up her little cards.
00:19:11 Oh no, I sold my switch to buy you this Pokemon game.
00:19:16 No.
00:19:17 What do we do?
00:19:21 Well, all right, that's it. Christmas is canceling.
00:19:23 There's no winning, Christmas. There's just no way to succeed.
00:19:28 So what else is on people's minds? This has pretty much been dominating my thoughts as I'm
00:19:32 trying to crank out some videos and buy-
00:19:34 I'm trying not to think about it.
00:19:35 Gifts. Yeah.
00:19:37 I've been playing Slime Rancher. Thanks, Ben.
00:19:40 I also, wait, did we talk about this on the last episode?
00:19:43 No, no, I didn't. So on the stream, on the-
00:19:46 Oh, it was on Shackles for Hackles. Yeah, no, I've been playing Slime Rancher.
00:19:49 I've been getting my fucking drone set up. They're so good.
00:19:52 I got the advanced drones now.
00:19:54 Oh, that's great.
00:19:56 Like, I haven't gone for this yet.
00:19:57 Speaking of the stream though, for this Christmas, give the gift that really matters.
00:20:00 Pledge for your friend to be able to play the PCP Minecraft server for only $5 a month.
00:20:06 You could just give us a down payment of like $100 and we'll just keep that going for a while.
00:20:10 That would be-
00:20:11 How many months is that?
00:20:12 We're not going to do that, actually.
00:20:14 That is just months.
00:20:15 Pokemon or Pixelmon is really fun.
00:20:18 The stream is really fun.
00:20:21 How many, how often do we do them?
00:20:22 At least once a month.
00:20:23 Right now we're doing about once a month, but-
00:20:25 We should do twice a month. I think that'd be cool.
00:20:28 I think the community has asked and I will deliver like next year, by next year, I mean January.
00:20:34 They want to have like sort of like a champion of the server.
00:20:36 So have like a Pokemon battle and decide who's the champion.
00:20:39 And they get to keep the title for a week and then people can challenge them for the title.
00:20:46 And once they win, they get the title for the week and stuff.
00:20:48 That's a cool, excellent idea.
00:20:50 So I was thinking of having the tournament and during the time we're streaming,
00:20:54 so people can see the tournament if that's okay.
00:20:56 Oh, that's a great idea.
00:20:58 And I know that I hadn't seen the construction, but I know some of the people are building like
00:21:01 an Elite Force Stadium somewhere or like an Indigo Plateau for the purposes of this.
00:21:06 So that would be fucking sick.
00:21:08 Gotta go, gotta go build my team.
00:21:10 Also, also a similar title for like just PvP.
00:21:14 And I might have to build a PvP arena in the nether.
00:21:18 But yeah, so like those two titles are gonna happen on January.
00:21:23 How excited.
00:21:24 Get it here first, folks.
00:21:25 That's the perfect chance.
00:21:25 All these things you could be experiencing firsthand.
00:21:29 Give us your money.
00:21:30 For only the low, low price of $5 per month.
00:21:33 Patreon.com slash PCB Minecraft, everybody.
00:21:36 I mean, the stream was like fucking yesterday or the day before or whatever.
00:21:39 And it was a great time.
00:21:39 If you want to give us a Christmas present, give us the present of your patronage.
00:21:45 Very true.
00:21:45 Actually, I stuck around for like several hours afterwards streaming on my Twitch.
00:21:50 Just grinding out levels and leveling up my...
00:21:54 Or did you use the crewhouse?
00:21:56 Yeah, I did.
00:21:58 That guy was all blissies.
00:21:59 So good.
00:22:01 It was amazing.
00:22:01 Oh yeah, yeah, blissies, yeah.
00:22:03 Yeah.
00:22:04 Speaking of which, speaking of streams and Pokemon, the official Pokemon heart gold BGE Nuzlocke
00:22:11 has begun, everybody.
00:22:13 That's all I'm just saying.
00:22:14 Oh yeah, let's get to Pokemon.
00:22:16 Let's discuss it endlessly.
00:22:17 I'm just saying that Nuzlocke is going.
00:22:22 Tuesdays and Saturdays, 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
00:22:24 It's great.
00:22:25 Name Pokemon.
00:22:26 Donate to me money.
00:22:27 I mean, what's the downside here?
00:22:28 The spirit of giving money all the time in every way possible.
00:22:31 Giving money to me.
00:22:32 Spirit of shilling, the spirit of shit.
00:22:36 You heard it.
00:22:37 Speaking of shilling, Davoo has a new game out.
00:22:41 I don't know whether you talked about it last week.
00:22:43 Oh yeah.
00:22:44 I was amazed.
00:22:46 I think I'm going to play that on Twitch tonight.
00:22:49 It's quite a short game, but it's very brain teaser-y.
00:22:53 Sounds cool.
00:22:54 Brain teaser.
00:22:55 You know, I had one issue.
00:22:56 I was wondering if you guys had this.
00:22:57 When I first loaded up the game, by the way, what's the name of it?
00:22:59 Chamber of Hex.
00:23:00 I can't remember.
00:23:01 That's right.
00:23:02 Chamber of Hex.
00:23:03 When I was playing H.E.X., that's correct.
00:23:07 I had an issue with a driver.
00:23:09 I was missing something.
00:23:09 I had to download whatever, DLL or something, whatever I fixed that.
00:23:12 But then when I was playing it, I just wasn't getting any music.
00:23:15 So I just stopped.
00:23:15 I was like, I got to fix this problem before I play this game,
00:23:18 because the music is one of the major features.
00:23:20 And I couldn't do it.
00:23:21 So I just decided I'd play it later.
00:23:23 Anybody else have that issue of playing it?
00:23:24 No.
00:23:25 I don't know.
00:23:26 I haven't played it so long.
00:23:28 Just me, I guess.
00:23:29 Okay.
00:23:29 Well, in any case, I did really like it and I wanted to play more.
00:23:31 So I'm going to fix that as soon as possible and then finish it.
00:23:34 Because I got to be happy to eat it.
00:23:35 Very cool art.
00:23:36 I have a question.
00:23:37 It's like, you changed your profile picture to that Digimon I linked it.
00:23:41 It's always a Digimon?
00:23:42 Yeah, I really like it.
00:23:43 It was a Digimon.
00:23:44 I thought it looked like a fucking like baby form Digimon, but I wasn't sure.
00:23:48 Yeah, you say, you give me Botomon.
00:23:50 Okay.
00:23:52 You give me Botomon?
00:23:53 You give me Botomon.
00:23:54 Right now, I have it as on both my screens of my desktop wallpaper stretched to fill.
00:24:01 So it's such a big happy face looking at me at all times.
00:24:05 Digimon is sick and ironically great.
00:24:09 I'm trying to see what it digivolves into.
00:24:11 I've been playing a mobile game of Digimon, an official one.
00:24:16 Oh yeah, that came out a while, not a super long time ago, a little while ago.
00:24:21 It's considered a species of Botomon.
00:24:25 Right.
00:24:25 Before we go off on nothing, just to mention, go check out Chamber of Hicks.
00:24:31 It's free.
00:24:32 It's a video game.
00:24:32 It's good.
00:24:33 It's short and it's got the same as Chiaros, Skrull, music that Davoo's worked with on his
00:24:41 previous game, really good musician man as well.
00:24:45 It's good.
00:24:48 Have a fun time with it.
00:24:49 Ah, good.
00:24:50 Okay, I see Mage posted a thing about the digivolve forms, by the way.
00:24:54 But I've got to say, it looks like it can digivolve into this beautiful creature known
00:24:58 as Poncho Mon, to one of its digivolusions.
00:25:02 Amazing.
00:25:02 As far as I'm considered concerned, that's a win.
00:25:05 That's a win.
00:25:05 God.
00:25:06 Reminds me of the base character, King Tacos, from One Piece.
00:25:09 What a legendary character that guy is.
00:25:11 Digimon is so good.
00:25:12 God damn.
00:25:14 I like the idea of Digimon.
00:25:16 I like how there's no rhyme or reason between the digivolvations.
00:25:20 And it can digivolve into them.
00:25:21 I'm not a fan of that, as it happens.
00:25:23 Seems pretty arbitrary and dumb.
00:25:25 Like they're not thinking about it.
00:25:26 No, no, no.
00:25:27 But it makes sense because you see their data and you can shape data in whatever which way
00:25:32 and you can involve into very different things.
00:25:34 That's true.
00:25:34 I mean, Pokemon are also data, essentially.
00:25:39 I mean, I know in lore, yeah, sure.
00:25:42 I don't even disagree that Digimon are crazy and random.
00:25:47 Basically, every Digimon's like Eevee.
00:25:49 They're just completely malleable.
00:25:51 Well, plus there's like a thing in, I forget.
00:25:53 It's like there's, with Digimon, there's like a vaccine, virus, and like data or whatever.
00:25:58 There's three main types.
00:25:59 And they can like change between them or something.
00:26:01 So there's like some kind of system for how they-
00:26:03 And they also have like elemental attacks as well.
00:26:06 So there's a bit of play between these things.
00:26:09 So sneak.
00:26:10 Has anyone played a good Digimon game in the last 10 years?
00:26:13 The DS ones are pretty good.
00:26:14 Yeah.
00:26:16 The new ones for like PS4, PS Vita.
00:26:20 Cyber Sleuth or Cyber Stalker.
00:26:21 Yeah, good things about them.
00:26:22 I've not played it.
00:26:23 They're also available on the Switch now.
00:26:25 The shows are quite well designed.
00:26:27 They're available on the Switch now.
00:26:29 So just letting you know you can-
00:26:31 Another game your friend can't play.
00:26:36 The Digimon like show series and stuff.
00:26:39 I remember watching like episode one to three because I had that on VHS and seeing some other
00:26:44 episodes on TV.
00:26:46 And then Pokemon was the obvious comparison.
00:26:51 Pokemon was so much easier to get into after the fact.
00:26:55 Because Digimon didn't have like a clear,
00:26:58 this is what the character wants and this is what he was going to try and do.
00:27:01 And then he goes and tries to do it.
00:27:03 It's just a bunch of kids who suddenly get magic powers and digital monsters and
00:27:08 they want to go back home.
00:27:09 Well, they want to go back home.
00:27:10 I mean, the whole premise of the original show is that they get transported into the digital world.
00:27:16 Isakai.
00:27:17 They get, it's yeah, it's basically an Isakai.
00:27:19 And the whole, like the thing that made Digimon difficult to watch,
00:27:23 like just kind of get into as a kid is because it was one of the few shows I was airing
00:27:27 in those time slots that had a single continuous story.
00:27:30 Yeah, that's it.
00:27:30 Like each episode directly continued from the last.
00:27:33 Whereas in Pokemon, it was like an episode of the week kind of thing.
00:27:36 Where it's like a simple one hour, half an hour conflict.
00:27:39 Even though it would not be difficult at all to get into Digimon, the anime,
00:27:44 I feel like this general sense of like apprehension to even thinking about it.
00:27:49 But I could easily just go watch Pokemon all over again.
00:27:52 Because that's simple.
00:27:54 I feel differently.
00:27:56 Watch Digimon, especially Tamers.
00:27:59 Tamer season three is fucking choice.
00:28:02 It has nothing to do with the previous two seasons,
00:28:04 it's its own self-contained story.
00:28:05 So you can just watch that.
00:28:07 It is great.
00:28:08 It is a 10 out of 10, unironically fantastic.
00:28:11 Go watch it.
00:28:12 It's sad that they completely dropped the ball with the enemies,
00:28:15 like starting with season four and downhill from there.
00:28:18 Season four was just barely tolerable, just barely.
00:28:22 And everything after that is just pants.
00:28:23 Wait, in Pokemon?
00:28:25 Digimon.
00:28:27 I heard people like Frontier, but I never watched it.
00:28:29 I've only watched the first three seasons.
00:28:31 The idea, it's a hit or miss.
00:28:33 If you like the idea of people becoming Digimon, then I guess.
00:28:36 That's why I didn't watch it.
00:28:38 Yeah.
00:28:39 I liked it when I was younger and when it was in German.
00:28:43 I recently, me and Bayer, tried to watch it like the dubbed one.
00:28:47 And we laughed about how stupid it was.
00:28:49 Like the dub was awful.
00:28:51 Everyone had like some sort of accent.
00:28:52 The dub of Digimon is, if you go on with the right mindset, it is such a joy.
00:28:58 Because the awful jokes that they add into the dub are incredible.
00:29:03 Incredible.
00:29:04 It is.
00:29:05 It is.
00:29:07 We compared some scenes.
00:29:08 There's this one scene where like Lee, the evil Digimon are sort of like coming,
00:29:14 like they're following the good people, like the main characters.
00:29:18 And they keep switching back and forth,
00:29:20 showing how like the antagonists are coming closer.
00:29:23 And like in the sub, it's kind of silent and ominous.
00:29:27 And you're just like, they're sort of getting closer.
00:29:29 But like in the dub, it's just like, there's this one guy with like a really stupid accent
00:29:35 going just a little further.
00:29:36 And then this other guy just like, shut up.
00:29:39 There's dialogue constantly.
00:29:40 It's like the guiding mantra of the dubs is like, we can't have silence ever.
00:29:45 And there's just like constant ad-libbing jokes and bad.
00:29:49 Was this a four kids production by Nathan?
00:29:51 It was not.
00:29:51 I don't remember.
00:29:52 But I think it was Saban by Saban.
00:29:55 I believe they did it possibly.
00:29:57 I could be wrong.
00:29:59 It was a good laugh, I'll say that much.
00:30:03 But like as much of a story or endearing character is like not at all.
00:30:07 One through three are good.
00:30:09 Three being the best.
00:30:10 One being the second best.
00:30:11 Two being good, but not great.
00:30:14 Go watch them.
00:30:14 Better than the rest.
00:30:15 They're good.
00:30:16 Better than the other ones.
00:30:17 Fourth one is just like just entertaining enough.
00:30:21 And the fifth one, I think it was like the one with like a lullamon.
00:30:26 Those cross wars, right?
00:30:28 No, that was the weird one with the different art style where the first episode is just a
00:30:34 regular guy punches a digimon in the face with his bare hands.
00:30:38 Like the fucking manliest man who ever lived.
00:30:40 There's a giant abumon who becomes his best bro.
00:30:43 That's all I remember about it.
00:30:44 Oh yeah.
00:30:45 Yeah.
00:30:45 Yeah.
00:30:46 That's the one.
00:30:46 I hated that one for one reason is because like there's this kid.
00:30:50 He grew up in the Digimon world and he has a partner that's an owl and the owl's very
00:30:57 eloquent that they had a mom fridge humon and she's also eloquent in English.
00:31:01 But he himself, in the dub at least, he himself talks like a stupid child.
00:31:07 It's just like, he just goes, I mean, oh, like you.
00:31:10 Oh, God, oh, God, you grew up around people who are eloquent.
00:31:14 Well, Digimon who are eloquent.
00:31:16 Why are you talking like this?
00:31:18 Some just have retarded brains.
00:31:19 Yeah, you know, some people just have mental problems,
00:31:21 mate.
00:31:21 You don't have to fucking drag them like that.
00:31:23 Cognitive diversity should be embraced, not criticized.
00:31:26 Diversity is our strength.
00:31:27 Because his design is like, you know, like a wild child or whatever.
00:31:31 I guess in the dub, they thought it's like appropriate for him to talk like that.
00:31:36 But it makes no sense.
00:31:37 That's not like these dub copies work.
00:31:39 Because Nico Robin wore a cowboy hat in her first appearance,
00:31:43 they just gave her like a Southern Belle voice actor
00:31:46 for like her entire four kids dub lifetime.
00:31:49 And it was, I mean, it was so, it's kind of charming actually.
00:31:54 But like, that's not, just because she's wearing a cowboy hat.
00:31:57 Well, hang on.
00:31:57 She's not actually a cowboy.
00:31:58 How do you know that that isn't what Elder intended?
00:32:03 I guess I don't give, you know what?
00:32:06 Got him.
00:32:07 I'd like to think that it was, maybe she had like a weird like Osaka accent
00:32:10 or however the fuck those jabs do that shit over there.
00:32:13 Can you tell that in written dialogue?
00:32:15 Probably, probably, I don't know.
00:32:18 Anyway, yes.
00:32:18 It's, I mean, there'll be like a guy who's like wearing one of those Russian hats
00:32:23 who they just give like a Russian accent to,
00:32:25 even though it's just like a character.
00:32:27 I don't know.
00:32:27 Is Osaka like, like it's usually depicted in dubs as like a Texas accent
00:32:33 to like differentiate it from normal voice actor accents
00:32:36 from normal America or whatever.
00:32:40 Is it?
00:32:40 It's Osaka, Texas.
00:32:42 Well, like what does it actually sound like?
00:32:44 Is it like, that's gonna be a major gomenasai for me?
00:32:48 Well, like is that how they actually talk?
00:32:51 There's no easy translation in English or anything,
00:32:53 but they are, I think the gist is that they are thought to talk
00:32:58 in a more like lackadaisical way, which is somewhat analogous to like the Texas drawl.
00:33:06 Like they have different ways of saying things.
00:33:08 And it is to the south, like Kyoto and...
00:33:11 Oh, Hayao Kazai, my ass.
00:33:12 Osaka to the south.
00:33:13 So I guess it kind of works.
00:33:17 I mean, I mean, I love Osaka, the character from Ozamangadayo
00:33:21 with her silly like Southern accent.
00:33:22 It is extremely adorable.
00:33:23 So it totally works as like a correlate, but is it 100% accurate?
00:33:28 I mean, no, no, no, it is not.
00:33:30 It could be.
00:33:31 But that's one of those like a dub adaptation things that I actually appreciate.
00:33:35 They're putting some thought into how to adapt it.
00:33:37 I guess really it's a localization question as to how to capture the spirit
00:33:40 of like a character who whose trait is that they talk weird
00:33:43 compared to the other Japanese contemporaries
00:33:46 and giving them the Osaka dialect converted to Texas shit.
00:33:50 Makes sense.
00:33:51 Makes sense.
00:33:51 Osaka from...
00:33:52 What a great show.
00:33:53 I like, yeah.
00:33:53 Ozamangadayo.
00:33:54 We did, I think, yeah, we did do a Chibi Baka's episode,
00:33:57 me and Munchy on Ozamangadayo.
00:34:00 Munchy hated it.
00:34:02 I liked it.
00:34:03 He hated it.
00:34:04 Did he, did you guys watch the dub?
00:34:06 I think I watched the dub.
00:34:08 I don't remember, actually.
00:34:09 I usually try to watch one or the other just to see,
00:34:14 like on the first episode, which is better.
00:34:18 We should do more of those fucking Chibi Baka's.
00:34:23 I have one recorded when Munchy came over, but I haven't edited it yet.
00:34:30 We watched Akira and we were like, what the fuck?
00:34:33 Oh, well, that's a great one.
00:34:36 People would love to hear your thoughts, I think.
00:34:37 Akira's pretty dope.
00:34:39 Akira's pretty dope, but I've, I don't know,
00:34:42 I've been recording lots of like little things here and there and being like,
00:34:46 but why would I put it out?
00:34:47 Why would I make anything?
00:34:49 Why would I make a video on this day and age?
00:34:54 I mean, you know, I think...
00:34:57 It gives just like, you know what?
00:34:58 I'm not sorry I haven't made a video in a while.
00:35:01 Proceeds to not make videos.
00:35:03 And literally, I'm not sorry.
00:35:05 The effort that go into editing it and putting it out, it's like,
00:35:09 you know what?
00:35:10 I'm just happy that I did it.
00:35:11 I don't really care.
00:35:13 You know, I get that.
00:35:14 That sounds like you have a healthy relationship to content creation.
00:35:17 You can't do that on this day and age.
00:35:18 Well, not if he's not getting it out any...
00:35:20 I mean, I think that releasing it is an important component of creating content.
00:35:24 Well, I mean, creating content.
00:35:25 I have like recorded the footage.
00:35:27 I would need to edit it and put it into a thing and see that it's okay.
00:35:31 So there's a hurt.
00:35:32 So there's something to do.
00:35:33 Okay, fair enough.
00:35:35 Right, you're absolutely right about that.
00:35:37 But I would encourage you that the good news is,
00:35:40 because you've self-avowedly not...
00:35:42 You're not a video man at this juncture in time or whatever.
00:35:46 There's very low expectation.
00:35:47 So anything you do release is just a bonus for everybody, including me.
00:35:51 So I'd very much like to see it.
00:35:52 I mean, yeah, it's a bonus.
00:35:53 I'm still waiting for Kingdom Hearts 2.
00:35:55 G-R-P-J, when?
00:35:57 When will it be released to the world?
00:35:59 I don't know, maybe never.
00:36:00 Probably never.
00:36:01 When Kingdom Hearts 4 comes out.
00:36:02 Alas.
00:36:03 Ooh, that'll be fun.
00:36:04 The thing though is like, I feel like putting...
00:36:11 Due to just the nature of what everyone else experiences on YouTube with other YouTubers,
00:36:16 is if anybody takes a break, whether they've completely retired
00:36:21 or they're just having a few days off,
00:36:25 there's this expectation of when they come back, it's got to be big.
00:36:29 It's got to be a big thing.
00:36:31 So that it's not like a limp sort of like, back onto the platform.
00:36:36 Like they've been waiting for years and then like if I...
00:36:39 Like the other day or the other week, or just whenever,
00:36:43 I upload something onto the Gibbentech channel
00:36:45 and it's just some like four second, four minute, silly thing.
00:36:50 I can't help but feel in the back of my mind that somebody's like,
00:36:54 yeah, like they see that they forgot about me because I hadn't been doing anything
00:36:59 and then they're reminded of me and it's not interesting.
00:37:01 And they're just sort of like, what a shame.
00:37:05 On that similar vein though, so one, you may have heard of him,
00:37:08 Digi Brony MLP uploaded a new video today
00:37:12 that is top 50 TV anime of the decade, one of two.
00:37:16 And upon watch, I watched the whole thing, I gotta say,
00:37:19 I loved that video because it was so quintessential,
00:37:25 like it's the best stuff Digi makes, things like this basically.
00:37:28 It's like none of this bullshit face cam,
00:37:30 get that content bullshit out of my face.
00:37:33 You're part of quarantine.
00:37:34 It's just I want the edited Anna cat's trash, don't watch it.
00:37:38 Each has their place, but this was like prime Digi,
00:37:43 just the reason that people subscribed to him years ago
00:37:46 and it just feels right, like exactly what...
00:37:49 Like I mean, just not to show you Digi, I love you,
00:37:52 but just looking at his channel, he's got like his last videos on the channel,
00:37:55 some art so far, it's a whirling dervish, a Pansu party podcasting over PSB, fine.
00:38:00 This retarded worst video I've ever seen,
00:38:02 the wife is the little sister, where he was obviously just high
00:38:06 and not thinking clearly, because I could explain to you in two seconds
00:38:09 why the wife is not the little sister Digi.
00:38:10 I just saw that thumbnail, I just let out a deep sigh
00:38:14 and then moved on with my life.
00:38:19 And then like this music review thing that I had some interest in,
00:38:21 but I'm not a big music guy for his strange ways here we come,
00:38:24 wherever the fuck that was.
00:38:26 And then this like classic Digi Bro video,
00:38:29 and like I just feel in myself like, ah, at last, relief,
00:38:33 the thing I've been looking for is here.
00:38:35 And that really makes me reflect on like my own content.
00:38:38 I was about to say Nate, I can't wait to feel that way
00:38:41 when my perception of this turned on myself.
00:38:44 I'm still waiting.
00:38:46 People didn't sign up when they signed up,
00:38:47 when they first subscribed or whatever,
00:38:49 for Mia Maffova or Weagawa or any other, even the Smash videos.
00:38:54 They didn't sign up for those.
00:38:55 They signed up for best enemy ever,
00:38:57 Ghost, the Gurrenlogging and Ghost in the Shell
00:38:59 and maybe Galco to some degree.
00:39:01 And God, it just, it really makes me think like,
00:39:04 I really should be giving people like as fast as possible
00:39:08 the stuff they really want, which is part of the plan of course,
00:39:10 but not fast enough for my taste.
00:39:12 Well, it's weird, right?
00:39:13 Because you feel like you have to do like weekly content
00:39:16 or just like keep the algorithm fed.
00:39:18 But then at the same time, it's like you, Nate, the person,
00:39:22 are doing weekly podcasts here.
00:39:24 You're doing weekly content on content.
00:39:27 It's like, why can't your channel just be some tentpole pieces
00:39:29 that you can promote from other sources?
00:39:31 Well, I mean, I gotta tell you, Tom,
00:39:32 that's really where my mind is heading these days,
00:39:34 but that seems like the reasonable way to go.
00:39:37 I don't know.
00:39:38 Yeah, the way it's always felt is like, for you and for Digi,
00:39:44 they have, you both have your big tightly written
00:39:47 analytical pieces that are really in-depth and great.
00:39:51 And Digi is just good at analysis generally,
00:39:55 so he can make a list, but he does the scripts well
00:39:59 and he doesn't quick.
00:40:00 And so something like this sort of list
00:40:02 is very exhaustive and very well-informed
00:40:04 and it's really useful and cool.
00:40:06 I bet he loved making it too, just watching it.
00:40:08 So like it's good.
00:40:10 Like I've seen some things I'd never seen anywhere else,
00:40:12 even on Digi's channel.
00:40:13 I was like, huh, that's interesting.
00:40:15 Yeah, and it's almost like for us as viewers,
00:40:17 we get kind of the most out of these videos out of anything.
00:40:20 And then there's like the second tier of goodness of content
00:40:25 where you've got the We Agua and Digi has vlogs
00:40:29 of various description where he rambles on about a topic
00:40:34 and you also ramble on with talking points in your heads,
00:40:38 but it's not as tight and it's not as edited or impactful.
00:40:43 It's pretty good.
00:40:44 Nobody really would complain that a video like that
00:40:47 is coming out all the time.
00:40:48 It's just sort of like in the back of your mind,
00:40:50 you're wishing for something else, something more intense.
00:40:56 There's some, you know, I know Digi.
00:40:58 Digi goes to a lot of, he'll explain a lot of this stuff.
00:41:02 He'll rationalize these things.
00:41:04 And I love the guy, I do it too about We Aguas and whatnot,
00:41:07 but there's just something.
00:41:08 There's something that's just part of this edited,
00:41:13 I don't know, like in our cases,
00:41:14 like these anime discussion things with like a script
00:41:17 and fancier editing and music in the background.
00:41:19 The fancy editing is less important
00:41:21 than the tightly written scripts.
00:41:22 And because usually when you're writing a script,
00:41:24 you come up to like, you get to the part where you're saying things,
00:41:28 writing things down that you would say just off the cuff
00:41:31 and then you realize, well, this bit's less interesting.
00:41:33 I can cut that and then I can go more in depth
00:41:36 into this more interesting thing.
00:41:37 And then it sort of naturally becomes
00:41:39 a more interesting video through that process.
00:41:42 So like, when I made the Konosuba,
00:41:46 like the YMS ripoff video I made on my channel recently,
00:41:49 I mean, yeah, I mean, even you, Gib, who's,
00:41:54 I mean, you're not much of an anime guy necessarily
00:41:56 compared to some of the other folks,
00:41:58 but you really enjoy that.
00:42:00 And when I was making that, I was really trying to embrace,
00:42:03 honestly, the Digi example of when I made a script
00:42:07 and then I was like, okay, I know this would be better
00:42:09 if it was shorter.
00:42:11 So I'm going to really dig deep and try to cut things.
00:42:13 It was the first video I've really tried to cut content from
00:42:17 in a way just to make it cleaner and better.
00:42:20 And even I was shocked, I still got complaints
00:42:22 that it was still too long and like wasting people's time,
00:42:25 even though I put so much work.
00:42:26 I guess I'm not perfect at this yet
00:42:28 about cutting unnecessary stuff,
00:42:30 but it's like eight minutes long.
00:42:31 I thought the whole thing was pretty great.
00:42:33 And just like, if that's all the videos on my channel,
00:42:37 I just feel like if I replaced Weagua's with things like that,
00:42:41 just everybody would be happier, including me.
00:42:45 I don't know, it took more time to make.
00:42:47 And it's, I mean, yeah, you're absolutely right.
00:42:50 I mean, I don't, we don't have to go on this
00:42:51 for too much longer, but like the new year's coming,
00:42:54 I'm feeling like it might be a time for a fresh start
00:42:57 on what I've been doing.
00:42:58 I've been trying what I've been doing for a while.
00:43:00 So I don't know, we'll see what happens.
00:43:02 If you're interested at all in Nate's channel,
00:43:05 known as Best Guy Ever on YouTube.com, maybe you've heard of it.
00:43:09 This has been a public service announcement.
00:43:14 The content channel that you and Digi do
00:43:17 is also feels like secondary content.
00:43:20 Like it's, it's good filler background noise,
00:43:24 but like it's not, you wouldn't go to that
00:43:27 and then discover Digi bro or Nate the best man you would.
00:43:31 Yes, I agree.
00:43:32 Although, you know, one of the conceits
00:43:34 behind the channel was that like,
00:43:36 Actually, maybe you would because it is more relevant anime.
00:43:38 So I don't know.
00:43:40 Yeah, see, that's the one strength I think it has
00:43:42 that like Digi and I, both of this thing where I don't know,
00:43:45 we were like, we talked to Victor, here's what I was going to say,
00:43:48 that like there was a conversation Digi told me about
00:43:50 with Victor and I think about this a lot
00:43:51 as inspiration for content.
00:43:53 And it's that like Victor told Digi that like he begs him to make
00:43:58 like fast videos about currently airing seasonal anime
00:44:02 because Victor just wants to hear about them
00:44:04 and because no one besides like Jeff and his contemporaries
00:44:08 are making those videos about those shows,
00:44:10 that's who he goes to watch.
00:44:12 And I think content is a few rungs in terms of like quality beneath,
00:44:17 like frankly, like, you know, a mother's basement scripted edited video.
00:44:21 You know, I don't hate Jeff or anything.
00:44:23 The type 10 content on YouTube came up with Digi bro first.
00:44:28 And then some strange thing called content media,
00:44:31 which is not content.
00:44:35 So I mean, to be fair, the channel is only like a month and a half old,
00:44:38 you know, it's still, it's still getting its legs.
00:44:41 It is a baby.
00:44:42 And actually even the content that's on there is basically like an alpha
00:44:46 or like a beta version of the content that we one day hope to have,
00:44:50 that'd be more like red letter media-esque on the channel.
00:44:53 So, you know, right now I think we're, I mean,
00:44:57 me and Digi already know we can talk about pretty much anything for a while.
00:45:00 We're both have the gift of gab and whatnot.
00:45:03 So hopefully we'll make some money, be able to finance some,
00:45:08 some upgraded equipment and whatnot, do this thing in person, possibly,
00:45:11 at some point, at some point.
00:45:12 The biggest episodes at the moment are
00:45:14 cautious hero and Pokemon Sword and Shield does it suck.
00:45:19 Like 11, 12 and 13 in K views each.
00:45:23 Which interestingly-
00:45:24 Martin's a good thumbnail choice for anything, you know.
00:45:27 Indeed.
00:45:27 Gotta get those fucking genders.
00:45:28 This must be a coincidence that those are like the most popular things
00:45:32 that we discussed.
00:45:33 That's probably just random.
00:45:35 Well, Pokemon, I feel like that's way more popular in general than anime.
00:45:39 So that would get more attention.
00:45:40 Well, that's true.
00:45:41 That breaks outside the little anime bubble.
00:45:43 I have no idea what cautious hero, how that caught on.
00:45:47 It's just a popular isekai.
00:45:48 Yeah, it's a currently airing-
00:45:50 It's a quality show.
00:45:51 Okay.
00:45:51 I thought Beastars was huge, but the-
00:45:55 I think it's kind of launched away in-
00:45:58 Well, you know, I guess I know nothing because I don't,
00:46:00 I don't like any of these circles.
00:46:02 I think the people who like it just really like it.
00:46:04 So I think they're just loud on social media.
00:46:06 I sort of get that feeling too.
00:46:07 And it is really good.
00:46:08 I know because I'm one of them.
00:46:09 Watch Beastars, you fucking peasants.
00:46:11 Yes, it's good.
00:46:12 Yes, yes.
00:46:13 But I mean, mostly me and Digi have been talking about the most popular shows.
00:46:17 Everything that we've watched, I think is worth people watching.
00:46:21 That we talked about on content so far, if they've got the time to burn.
00:46:24 Probably Beastars, Blade of the Immortal and Cautious Hero are the best ones.
00:46:28 I am curious, as someone who's been observing content, as from the very beginning,
00:46:34 what was the decision or the thought behind doing every four episodes
00:46:41 instead of doing a weekly show where you just covered all the stuff?
00:46:44 Would it just-
00:46:45 Time saving?
00:46:46 That's a very-
00:46:46 Like this weekend animatic reasoning.
00:46:49 I mean, it's kind of a middle ground between-
00:46:53 First of all, we wanted to do like two episodes a week.
00:46:55 Because we're not prepared to spend all our time on this as it exists right now,
00:46:59 for the paltry amount it's earning as it is.
00:47:04 We wanted a middle ground between reviewing every episode as it comes out,
00:47:08 which is the way that Digi and I traditionally had done our Aromanga Sensei
00:47:12 and our Rick and Morty stuff and those kinds of shows.
00:47:16 And not also having to wait until the end of a season to talk about anything at all.
00:47:21 So it was Digi's idea, but I think it works out pretty well
00:47:24 that it's just- it's a decent chunk of the show.
00:47:26 It's not that we- we can avoid the semi-pitfall of like,
00:47:30 when you discuss just one episode of a show at a time,
00:47:34 you could be like very critical and very nitpicky about like,
00:47:37 oh, this episode didn't make me feel happy in my pants as I wanted to,
00:47:42 because the girls weren't sexy enough.
00:47:43 This episode, well, Nate, that's because next episode, they're extremely sexy.
00:47:47 So that's what you have to wait for.
00:47:50 So, you know, it just- that's part of it I think at least for me as to why.
00:47:53 I was interested because like, you're doing the four-episode block thing,
00:47:57 but then you're also doing the potty cast, which is every chapter.
00:48:01 So you're-
00:48:01 Well, that's a separate venture, you know.
00:48:03 Digi's no one-piece expert, so that's- that exists to serve a particular demographic.
00:48:09 I mean, plus like, potty cast exists to serve exactly one thing,
00:48:13 which is the one-piece manga, whereas contents for whatever is due of discussion at that particular time.
00:48:20 If there was like a really hype one-piece arc, if Digi was read up to it,
00:48:23 we probably would talk about it like on content or something,
00:48:26 but I don't think he'll be catching up any time soon.
00:48:29 Probably not.
00:48:29 So there you go, that's- that's my thoughts.
00:48:31 And if Digi ever wanted to show up to one of these episodes, he could tell you about it too.
00:48:35 Yeah, Digi also roasted-
00:48:37 Has been not in the chat or online to- to talk with anyone ever.
00:48:44 He has been busy.
00:48:45 I just would like to know what Digi and Jesse are up to.
00:48:49 I know more about what Davoo's doing right now.
00:48:51 I mean, I could tell you, Digi's just busy with getting his videos for the end of the year and-
00:48:55 I suppose.
00:48:55 I mean, yeah, talk at content and stuff.
00:48:56 It's just sort of like, yeah, he is my friend, I wouldn't like to see him.
00:49:02 Yeah, understandable.
00:49:04 If you add him, he'll just probably show up eventually.
00:49:06 He's a hard man to read.
00:49:07 I'll slap him.
00:49:08 I'll attack him.
00:49:11 He has said before that like the only Discord groups he's in, like, is like the PCP and like maybe one of two others,
00:49:18 like, I guess the content, the one that he and I have, and that's it, because he only gives a shit.
00:49:23 Those of us in this group have to say to him on Discord.
00:49:27 So if you added me, probably.
00:49:28 Yeah.
00:49:28 Although I did add him yesterday demanding his W9 forum for tax purposes in the PCP,
00:49:34 which he has not gotten to me after six months, and we need it from him, you, Ben, and Jesse as well, who actually did respond.
00:49:42 I thought, okay, the last time we talked about it, you were like,
00:49:46 well, actually, maybe I have, maybe I messed it up. Don't worry about it. I'll tell you about it later.
00:49:51 Okay, that's absolutely true. You are correct, but I couldn't figure it out.
00:49:55 Later is now, and now I need it.
00:49:56 So now it has become later.
00:49:57 Ben, Ben, you sedated right now. What's going on?
00:50:00 Did you roll out of bed?
00:50:01 I am pretty hungover, so I'm not technically sedated, but I wish I was.
00:50:06 You might as well be.
00:50:07 Did you get Big Drunk on the RCK stream?
00:50:12 I got Big Drunk on the RCK stream.
00:50:15 I got, well, I got Fairly Drunk on the RCK stream, but it was nothing compared to what was to come later.
00:50:23 How many doors did you knock on this week?
00:50:24 Is this the new Ben segment, the weekly inebriation where each week?
00:50:28 What substance will Ben abuse this week?
00:50:30 Actually, we did. Me and one of my roommates did go across the street and knock on the door,
00:50:34 but it was at an appropriate time this time because there was a party going on,
00:50:37 and we were like, let's go over there and bring some alcohol and just be like,
00:50:40 hey, what's up? Let's hang out. But they didn't answer.
00:50:44 Oh, that's cool.
00:50:46 Wait, so the party was going on inside?
00:50:47 We could hear, there was stuff going on.
00:50:49 We went and knocked on the door to see if they wanted to, I don't know,
00:50:53 let us in on it or whatever.
00:50:55 Yeah, sure.
00:50:55 That's good.
00:50:56 But it was upstairs and the door was downstairs, so maybe they just genuinely didn't hear it.
00:51:01 And we just...
00:51:02 Should have thrown rocks at the window.
00:51:03 Should have thrown bricks through the window.
00:51:05 I've got, we had some.
00:51:07 I got two.
00:51:08 Indeed.
00:51:09 I locked myself, well, me and my other roommate, a different roommate,
00:51:14 locked ourselves on the porch the other day and because the handle to the door is broken,
00:51:21 the handle came off and I accidentally left the handle inside and then he closed the door
00:51:25 without realizing I had left it there.
00:51:27 So what I tried to do...
00:51:29 So you weren't like trapped outside, you were trapped in this space of the porch.
00:51:31 I was on this porch.
00:51:32 Yeah.
00:51:33 So what I tried, yeah, specifically on this porch, couldn't leave it.
00:51:36 So I tried to take two bricks and put them around the like door handle like bit,
00:51:42 like the bit sticking out of the handle is supposed to attach to and turn.
00:51:46 I tried using bricks to like squeeze the handle or squeeze the knob,
00:51:51 what's what remained of the knob and like turn it.
00:51:54 And guess what, it didn't work.
00:51:56 Any luck.
00:51:56 We just had to bang on the door for a really loud and make everyone upset.
00:52:00 And they rubbed them together, started a fire.
00:52:03 Smokescreen burned the house down and escaped.
00:52:06 But I managed to avoid putting them through the window to get back in.
00:52:09 So that's a win for me.
00:52:10 That's good.
00:52:13 I mean, that's what I've been up to.
00:52:14 That's my week.
00:52:16 That's a hell of a take.
00:52:18 A hell of a story.
00:52:19 A hell of a time.
00:52:21 All slime and punishment is almost done.
00:52:23 Just like it's been almost done for years now.
00:52:26 Oh yeah, that's true.
00:52:28 How exciting.
00:52:29 Maybe another two dozen images left to go or something like that.
00:52:33 And then I've been thinking about the epilogue.
00:52:35 I don't want to say too much about it,
00:52:37 but I've been considering various forms that the epilogue might take.
00:52:42 And it might get pretty ambitious with it.
00:52:45 We'll see.
00:52:47 That's not the climax.
00:52:48 The climax I know is going to be a video.
00:52:50 The epilogue will be something else.
00:52:52 You can get some ghost writers to fanfic write the epilogue just like Homestuck.
00:52:58 Yeah, get the Lord of Ghostwriters in there.
00:53:00 Lord of Ghostwriters.
00:53:02 Mix it up.
00:53:05 Hey, what's the status of the Kickstarter?
00:53:08 I want my damn comics and pins.
00:53:09 Well, a bunch of people are still working on their chapters,
00:53:16 and a couple people haven't even gotten their scripts from me yet.
00:53:21 Oh, here's a question.
00:53:24 I was just curious.
00:53:25 Will the digital copies of the updated stuff like that be available,
00:53:29 or will I have to wait for a physical copy?
00:53:32 I don't care either way.
00:53:32 I'm just curious if it'll be available online before the end.
00:53:35 At some point, yes, but not for a while.
00:53:39 Okay.
00:53:41 All right, Gib, explain yourself now.
00:53:42 Okay.
00:53:43 Why are you delaying and fucking this up for everyone?
00:53:46 I mean, I have had the script for a few weeks.
00:53:48 I was busy doing other things and had a cold, and I just was lazy.
00:53:53 For the beginning of December,
00:53:54 I just was lazy playing video game.
00:53:57 But I finished the video game.
00:53:59 Singular video game.
00:54:00 Yeah, literally.
00:54:01 I beat the entire video game, and now I'm serious,
00:54:04 and I opened up Photoshop today, and I was sketching the page,
00:54:08 and I hated it, and I was not sure how to do it.
00:54:11 It was just one of those annoying things,
00:54:15 where I know the size of the page.
00:54:17 It's about the panels and the order they come in,
00:54:21 life to write, you know, normal Western comic ideals.
00:54:26 And I'm trying to fit, like, it's just a lot of thinking.
00:54:30 The panel layout is the most difficult part of any comic.
00:54:34 Drawing it is easy.
00:54:35 Once you know where the panels are, what shape they are,
00:54:39 and where the speech bubbles go, then everything's great,
00:54:42 and then you can just line it and draw it, and it's easy.
00:54:46 But...
00:54:47 Panel layout is a whole art in and of itself.
00:54:49 And when you read a fucking sick manga,
00:54:52 where the panel layout just blows your mind,
00:54:54 you're like, how did they come up with this?
00:54:56 Yeah.
00:54:56 The way I do it, which is not the right way to do it,
00:54:59 is I draw a rectangle, and I draw what's in the rectangle,
00:55:01 and then I realize, well, I think, okay,
00:55:04 so this takes up this much of the page,
00:55:06 there's this much to the right of it left,
00:55:09 so I can put one panel there, and then underneath it...
00:55:11 Do not thumbnail your pages first.
00:55:14 You don't thumbnail your pages first.
00:55:17 What does thumbnail mean?
00:55:19 It's like when you do a tiny little sketch version of it,
00:55:22 really loosely, just kind of lay it out
00:55:23 before you start doing...
00:55:25 I mean, that's kind of what I am doing.
00:55:28 Like, I'm not drawing the finished panels,
00:55:29 I'm just sort of drawing boxes and seeing...
00:55:32 Like, I want this action to be going from left to right.
00:55:35 He's holding a thing, he goes this way,
00:55:38 we need to zoom in on this, zoom in on that,
00:55:40 and then, oh, turn the page,
00:55:42 and then we see the next thing on the next page,
00:55:44 that's when you see the next thing.
00:55:46 I thought you meant you were just like,
00:55:48 you just did one panel at a time, like final art,
00:55:51 and I'm like, you brave motherfucker, that's some crazy shit.
00:55:54 That's the stupidest thing you could ever do.
00:55:56 Right, which is why I was like, damn.
00:55:58 I'm just stuck on this, I've got one page sort of good,
00:56:00 and I'm trying to figure out the second page,
00:56:02 and it's just not clicking, I don't really...
00:56:05 And when something's not clicking,
00:56:07 it's very easy to do your text returns, or, you know...
00:56:11 That's the real reason why I'm doing it, sure.
00:56:14 I can relate, I can relate.
00:56:15 I mean, what I like to do is,
00:56:16 I like to bust open my favorite comics,
00:56:18 and read them intentionally,
00:56:20 and pay attention to the panel layouts a bit.
00:56:22 And then I kind of put them under my paper,
00:56:23 and trace over them,
00:56:24 and I just get really good results with that.
00:56:26 Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
00:56:28 I think one thing I always have difficulty with
00:56:31 is understanding how small I can draw something.
00:56:35 Like, when I see a panel, I think,
00:56:37 okay, the face has to go in this panel,
00:56:39 and I make it fill the panel,
00:56:42 but you don't have to do that,
00:56:43 and you also don't have to have the full face in the panel.
00:56:46 You could have it really zoomed in.
00:56:48 It's just a lot of...
00:56:49 That's true.
00:56:50 It's a lot of decisions that I'm not good at making yet.
00:56:55 Do you have that...
00:56:55 I don't know much about comics or anything,
00:56:57 but I have read a lot of One Piece.
00:56:59 One Piece is a big inspiration,
00:57:00 because those panels are very simple,
00:57:02 but the things in them are great, and very rarely...
00:57:06 I've collected the group shot that you made the thumbnail
00:57:07 of the body cast.
00:57:08 Yeah, I'm just curious.
00:57:09 I don't know if you've ever seen this,
00:57:11 but I'm going to link something for you,
00:57:12 because I use this all the time,
00:57:13 and I was making comics.
00:57:15 It's the Wally Woods 22 comic panels that always work.
00:57:21 It's pretty cool.
00:57:22 Oh, that sounds useful.
00:57:23 It's just like a reference of different kinds of comic panels
00:57:27 and way to lay things out
00:57:28 that just gets the nog and jog,
00:57:31 and you can start thinking about it.
00:57:32 It's pretty cool.
00:57:33 I'll have a look right now.
00:57:37 So, on this front, Ben, are there any other holdouts,
00:57:41 any other moral degenerates
00:57:42 who we should perhaps throw, you know,
00:57:45 who we should either kink shame
00:57:46 or throw bricks through windows of
00:57:48 to spur them along on their quest?
00:57:53 The only one who is done is Cheezy.
00:58:00 Munchy's working on his.
00:58:02 Hippo's working on his,
00:58:03 and then I haven't fucking done anything
00:58:07 for Jade Murrow or Nexus Mania.
00:58:09 Or am I forgetting someone?
00:58:12 In Kazzy, I haven't given her the script either.
00:58:14 I'll fucking...
00:58:17 I don't want to talk about it.
00:58:19 No, talk about it.
00:58:21 Leave me alone.
00:58:21 Leave me alone, you boys.
00:58:21 Are you a Kickstarter hell right now?
00:58:26 You're a Kickstarter purgatory burning away your sins.
00:58:29 Dude, writing is easy.
00:58:30 That's where I am, yeah.
00:58:31 You just imagine that you are the character,
00:58:33 and then you say the most embarrassing things possible,
00:58:35 and then you write it down.
00:58:36 That's right.
00:58:37 That's right.
00:58:38 Just for...
00:58:38 Yeah.
00:58:39 I always assumed the Vapors was just a biography, so...
00:58:45 Just remember, it's supposed to be bad.
00:58:49 I just got to do what I do with Slime and Punishment,
00:58:51 and think this is supposed to be bad,
00:58:53 and it would be off-brand if it were good.
00:58:58 Oh, that's very helpful there.
00:59:00 That's not healthy reverse psychology.
00:59:03 That's the secret.
00:59:05 That's the secret right there.
00:59:07 I assume you guys are similarly,
00:59:09 but I spend a lot of time,
00:59:11 or maybe I don't spend a lot of time directly thinking about it,
00:59:13 but I really feel imposed upon in a helpful way by the rules.
00:59:19 Like, my existence and the things I do change
00:59:22 based on whatever I perceive the rules of the game to be at that time.
00:59:26 It's like, right now, it's like, I need to make videos,
00:59:29 got to make a weekly Weagua video or something,
00:59:32 but if I formally change...
00:59:34 If I make an announcement
00:59:35 that I'm changing the rules of the game now,
00:59:38 then I feel perfect permission to do things,
00:59:41 or I don't know, do whatever.
00:59:43 But if I don't announce it,
00:59:45 I feel like the eyes of the public enforcing those rules upon me,
00:59:49 and it's...
00:59:50 I don't know, maybe this is more of a normal thing.
00:59:51 It's just people have expectations,
00:59:53 and then you live up to them or not.
00:59:54 I used to feel like that.
00:59:55 Now I feel the opposite.
00:59:56 I feel like the best way to do things
00:59:57 is just to subtly make changes,
01:00:00 and just do it by degree so nobody notices,
01:00:03 because I feel like if you make an announcement saying
01:00:04 you're changing,
01:00:05 you're just going to generate controversy in the backlight.
01:00:07 Because we know people don't like change.
01:00:08 They don't want to hear about it.
01:00:09 Exactly.
01:00:09 If you just do it, then it'll probably go over better.
01:00:11 Yeah, you're right, you're right.
01:00:13 You just got to do it subtly,
01:00:14 and before they know it, that's the new normal,
01:00:16 and they're just like, you've conditioned them subconsciously
01:00:18 without anyone realizing it's happening.
01:00:21 I definitely agree that that's a better way to do it,
01:00:23 although the one thing is that if...
01:00:25 Let's just say, for example,
01:00:26 you have a Patreon with very clear, explicit deliverables
01:00:31 that you are expected to deliver,
01:00:33 and if you were to want to change that in some capacity,
01:00:36 it seems like the only honest thing to do is to inspect.
01:00:38 I'm going to change my Patreon.
01:00:40 I'm going to start delivering nothing.
01:00:42 How do you...
01:00:42 Yes.
01:00:44 Yeah.
01:00:45 Well, I feel like...
01:00:45 I'm still sad that...
01:00:46 I feel like if you...
01:00:47 You can talk openly to your patrons,
01:00:50 because they're the ones who are the most hardcore.
01:00:53 So whatever you do, they're there for...
01:00:55 You're going to be in your court,
01:00:57 unless you royally fuck up.
01:00:58 Although literally...
01:00:59 I would say,
01:00:59 Include and deliver nothing.
01:01:00 Communicate with your patrons,
01:01:01 because I talk to my patrons.
01:01:03 Every week I do a Patreon podcast,
01:01:04 and whenever I have any thoughts
01:01:06 about my creative process or things I want to change,
01:01:09 I'll talk to them,
01:01:10 because they're the ones who are actually paying for it.
01:01:11 As far as I'm concerned,
01:01:12 they're the board of the directors.
01:01:13 And so I'll keep them in the know,
01:01:16 but the public can just get what they get.
01:01:18 They don't need to know.
01:01:19 They don't need to know.
01:01:20 Because I feel like the public are the ones
01:01:22 that are on the fence about you,
01:01:23 and they're the ones that will bitch the most about anything.
01:01:25 So I'm just like,
01:01:26 well, I might as well just keep controversy to the minimum,
01:01:30 just do what I want to do,
01:01:32 and deal with,
01:01:33 put out fires as they come,
01:01:35 as opposed to lighting the match myself.
01:01:37 That makes a lot of sense.
01:01:39 Yeah, that's a good point.
01:01:40 That's a good point.
01:01:43 And I was going to say,
01:01:43 I'm still disappointed that Ben's idea of the Ben St.
01:01:47 is creating a Patreon,
01:01:48 and that idea of just support me
01:01:51 as I create this Patreon page.
01:01:52 This Patreon is my magnum opus.
01:01:55 This will be my legacy.
01:01:56 Help me create.
01:01:57 Help me create the greatest Patreon of all time.
01:01:58 It was just too big brain of an idea.
01:02:01 It was too smart for the people to latch on to.
01:02:04 They couldn't comprehend the magic.
01:02:05 Before it's time, unfortunately,
01:02:07 Jake Paul will get around to it like in 2022,
01:02:09 and it'll do gang clusters,
01:02:11 and then we'll all be able to sue.
01:02:12 And it'll be big.
01:02:13 They'll call him a genius.
01:02:14 They'll call him a genius.
01:02:15 Oh, it's like Tesla.
01:02:16 It's like the world couldn't handle Tesla
01:02:18 making more than one world-changing idea at a time.
01:02:21 It was too big.
01:02:23 The Vapors, the champion,
01:02:25 these were already too advanced.
01:02:27 He was already celebrated,
01:02:28 but when he attempted to do this,
01:02:29 it was just a bridge too far.
01:02:30 The people couldn't handle it.
01:02:32 As he exposed capitalism
01:02:34 for the farce that it truly is.
01:02:36 It could have been great if only.
01:02:40 Man, it was such a golden idea.
01:02:42 I don't understand how it didn't take off.
01:02:45 It's bizarre.
01:02:46 It just needed better marketing.
01:02:47 That's all it needed.
01:02:47 Incomprehensible.
01:02:48 Yeah, yeah.
01:02:49 It word of mouth.
01:02:50 If I just got,
01:02:51 if I could just have gotten one Super Bowl ad
01:02:53 for my Patreon,
01:02:57 it would have been different.
01:02:59 Like when Patreon was relatively new,
01:03:01 like one dude created like a Patreon,
01:03:03 like he asked for like $5 to like make a lasagna,
01:03:06 to like buy, and he ended up making like tens of thousands of dollars
01:03:09 because people just thought it was funny.
01:03:10 Potatoes.
01:03:11 No.
01:03:11 And it wasn't Patreon, it was like Kickstarter.
01:03:16 It was Kickstarter, yeah.
01:03:17 Okay, a similar idea though,
01:03:19 but yes, fair point, fair point.
01:03:21 Well, Ben should have started a Patreon for potato salad.
01:03:24 Clearly, that was the missing ingredient.
01:03:26 It's not Keto though.
01:03:26 Maybe this would have gone over better.
01:03:28 But people didn't think of it as a recurring donation.
01:03:30 They thought of it as like,
01:03:31 what if you made a Kickstarter,
01:03:32 Ben State is creating a Kickstarter,
01:03:35 which is this Kickstarter.
01:03:37 You know, please help me support me in mine.
01:03:39 Oh, so for the Vapors Volume 3,
01:03:40 you're going to have a Patreon to fund the Kickstarter
01:03:42 for the Vapors.
01:03:48 Then we're going to have the Indiegogo
01:03:50 to fund the Patreon creation,
01:03:51 to fund the Kickstarter.
01:03:52 We're just going to go like multiple levels deep.
01:03:55 Going to go deep, yeah.
01:03:56 Yeah, yeah.
01:03:58 Well, boys and girls,
01:04:00 I'm ready to go to the voicemails if you are.
01:04:02 Boys and girls, boys and girls lined up.
01:04:04 I know.
01:04:04 We don't have to, we don't have to now.
01:04:07 Much like Nate's content,
01:04:08 maybe we should just trim the fat and...
01:04:12 Maybe, maybe.
01:04:12 I mean, it's going to,
01:04:13 like people are going to hear this
01:04:14 on the 22nd, I think.
01:04:18 No, no, no, no, no, 20th.
01:04:19 No, the 20th.
01:04:20 Yeah, 20th.
01:04:20 That's right, 20th.
01:04:21 But this will be the last episode
01:04:22 before Christmas, everybody.
01:04:24 Maybe they have shit to do.
01:04:26 So...
01:04:27 So yeah, we'll assume they're busy.
01:04:28 It's okay though,
01:04:29 because we've got,
01:04:30 we've got some choice of voicemails lined up today.
01:04:32 Yeah, they might actually take two hours.
01:04:34 Won't waste too much of your time.
01:04:35 You can go back to your families eventually,
01:04:37 I guess.
01:04:37 You want to do that, gross.
01:04:40 Precisely, precisely.
01:04:43 Ah, shit.
01:04:43 Where the fuck did I put the SoundCloud link?
01:04:46 Okay, there it is.
01:04:47 Found it, found it.
01:04:47 All right, all right.
01:04:49 Let me pull up the...
01:04:50 Okay, sounds like we're all fine with going to the voicemails.
01:04:52 Yeah, okay.
01:04:54 All right, so let me just preface it
01:04:57 by saying, of course, ladies and gentlemen,
01:04:59 go click the link down below
01:05:01 and leave us your voicemails,
01:05:03 which we will be delighted to hear
01:05:05 and to separate the wheat from the chaff.
01:05:07 And if they are good,
01:05:08 if they are quality,
01:05:09 if they are supremely glorious,
01:05:12 we will play them on the show
01:05:13 as we do as you're about to hear.
01:05:15 So, okay, we've got our first one here.
01:05:19 This is from Centerpoint.
01:05:21 And it's called...
01:05:22 Oh, actually, it's untitled from Centerpoint.
01:05:26 Let's just get us started off
01:05:27 in the right direction
01:05:28 with whatever he has to say.
01:05:30 Take it away, CP.
01:05:38 I don't want a lot for Christmas
01:05:41 There is just one thing I need
01:05:44 And I don't care about the Riddler
01:05:48 Or the weird ass dating sim
01:05:51 I don't need to wait for Radcon
01:05:54 Non-existent quick draw streams
01:05:57 My craft stuff won't make me happy
01:06:00 Or bonus apps on Christmas Day
01:06:04 I just want for you to know
01:06:07 Should've happened a long ago
01:06:10 Make my wish come true
01:06:13 All I want for Christmas is...
01:06:16 Then, huckstable, to join the PCB already.
01:06:19 Damn it.
01:06:23 Why don't we have a pie, Pels?
01:06:24 Why doesn't this guy have one?
01:06:27 Yeah, he deserves it more than us.
01:06:29 I mean, great work, Centerpoint.
01:06:32 Zend's a great guy.
01:06:32 What can I say?
01:06:33 Maybe we'll make your Christmas wish come true.
01:06:36 Who can say?
01:06:38 All right, never.
01:06:39 No, fuck that guy.
01:06:39 No, fuck that guy.
01:06:40 No, he's can't.
01:06:41 We're canceling each other.
01:06:44 That's all there is to it.
01:06:45 That's my plan for the holidays.
01:06:48 All right, let's move on.
01:06:50 We've got another one.
01:06:51 Oh, this is called Yes, I Am Sick.
01:06:53 That's Why My Voice Sucks.
01:06:56 Let's see if the prophecy is true.
01:07:00 Hey, fuckheads.
01:07:00 I'm asking for a dick tip.
01:07:02 So, as soon as you have spent the past couple of months
01:07:04 bashing in the Chad lifestyle,
01:07:06 getting confident and charismatic in the whole shebang,
01:07:08 and has realized how shitty every single person on this earth is,
01:07:11 how exactly do I go about finding the coveted GF?
01:07:14 But what I understand,
01:07:15 all you guys found your significant others by making content
01:07:18 but as someone who is both a high school sophomore
01:07:21 and has absolutely no creative energies whatsoever,
01:07:24 where exactly do I go to seek out my fellow autists?
01:07:27 All my communities are great and all,
01:07:28 but I'd hate to find the apple of my eye
01:07:30 just to find out that she lives in fucking Wyoming or something.
01:07:32 You're in fucking school, dude.
01:07:35 That's where you fucking do it, you nerd.
01:07:38 You go to school with a group of your peers.
01:07:41 Yeah.
01:07:42 I mean, that's the answer.
01:07:42 That's the answer.
01:07:43 That's the basket to draw from.
01:07:45 I mean, okay, he's saying like I don't have...
01:07:48 He wants like a gamer girlfriend, you know?
01:07:50 He wants like a fellow interested...
01:07:51 You said that?
01:07:53 He said something like that.
01:07:54 He said he wanted a fellow autist.
01:07:57 Right.
01:07:58 There you go.
01:07:58 So he's looking for...
01:07:59 Maybe he goes to school with a bunch of Stacey's,
01:08:01 a bunch of Veronica's.
01:08:02 We'll just go to Anime Club with Carl Ackersenville and his brother.
01:08:05 True.
01:08:06 I mean, okay, look, he says the thing in here
01:08:10 about like, you guys will guide it through making content.
01:08:13 Okay, okay.
01:08:14 It's the wrong lens to think that like,
01:08:16 oh, the PCB made a podcast and got girlfriends.
01:08:19 I mean, for some of us, that's true.
01:08:20 For me, that is true.
01:08:22 But like, it's not that simple.
01:08:24 It's what did I actually do in order to like get a girlfriend?
01:08:28 I did whatever the fuck I wanted to do.
01:08:31 I slowly acquired skills at it over years,
01:08:34 and I encountered various people while doing so.
01:08:37 So it's not about being a content creator.
01:08:39 It's about doing stuff that you want to do
01:08:43 and like being open to meeting people while doing so.
01:08:46 It's about having some skill that is impressive.
01:08:50 It doesn't have to be a podcast.
01:08:51 Even if that skill...
01:08:54 I would even argue that doing a podcast
01:08:56 is probably on the lower end of the bell curve
01:08:58 in terms of impressive skills.
01:08:58 It's one of the worst ways.
01:09:00 It's the opposite of what you should do.
01:09:02 Because exactly as you said, it's like,
01:09:04 oh, you'll meet a girl from like a million,
01:09:05 my girlfriend was from Hawaii.
01:09:07 We had to like date for a while and then decide to move.
01:09:09 So like that was, you know, like ideally,
01:09:12 the thing to do is meet people around you.
01:09:14 This whole idea of meeting people online from far away
01:09:16 is so retarded.
01:09:17 Leave the house and go talk to people in real life.
01:09:20 That first of all,
01:09:21 that's how you meet people directly around you.
01:09:23 So you don't have to do all that bullshit.
01:09:25 And it's how you like acquire socialization skills anyway.
01:09:29 So it's just obviously, okay, you're in school,
01:09:32 like nut up and talk to the girls in your class.
01:09:35 Because this other thing he says about like,
01:09:36 ah, I want to meet a gamer girl.
01:09:38 I want to meet a girl who's like me.
01:09:40 Like they're probably our girls in your school,
01:09:45 in your class who, oh my God,
01:09:47 could you imagine a girl liking anime,
01:09:49 but not talking about it excessively
01:09:51 or like wearing anime shirts to school every day.
01:09:54 So like you have to kind of get to know her first
01:09:55 in order to find that out.
01:09:57 No, it could possibly be true.
01:09:59 So, you know, just like talk to people
01:10:02 and meet them and get to know them.
01:10:03 Talk to people and improve yourself
01:10:05 in whatever way you can.
01:10:07 Just go up to all the girls in the school and say,
01:10:09 hey, do you like anime?
01:10:12 Unironically, yes, unironically.
01:10:15 Or pull the Spider-Man, put the hand on shoulder,
01:10:19 sexual assault and say, hey, that's the way.
01:10:22 It worked for, it worked for-
01:10:24 This is not related to anything,
01:10:26 but I just, for the first time,
01:10:28 I've seen what Vivzi Pop looks like.
01:10:32 Just, I don't know what she looks like.
01:10:33 She looks like exact, she is the,
01:10:37 the platonic ideal of a white girl who fucks dogs.
01:10:42 What?
01:10:44 She looks exactly like that.
01:10:46 I need proof.
01:10:47 If you don't remember who this is, everybody.
01:10:49 That's a big claim, Ben.
01:10:50 The big claim.
01:10:50 She may have been a hotel.
01:10:52 Yes, yes, yes.
01:10:53 Other things too.
01:10:54 Among other things.
01:10:55 Ben, I'm waiting for this image.
01:10:56 Law and animation.
01:10:57 I guess I'll screenshot it.
01:10:59 Yes, please do.
01:11:02 We will pause and wait for this update.
01:11:04 Here we go.
01:11:06 There she is.
01:11:09 Yeah.
01:11:10 Yeah, you know.
01:11:12 You can picture it, right?
01:11:13 I sure can.
01:11:14 Absolutely.
01:11:18 No, just think about it.
01:11:19 Just really rattle that one around in the old brain dome.
01:11:21 Speaking of Vivzi Pop, right before the podcast,
01:11:24 she was tweeting, had a big tweet thread about complaining
01:11:26 about how people give her shit.
01:11:28 Vivzi Pop, stop.
01:11:30 Stop publicly acknowledging it.
01:11:31 It just makes it worse.
01:11:32 You're just drawing attention to yourself.
01:11:33 It kind of makes you look like a fucking idiot.
01:11:35 Tweets like that are a lightning rod for controversy.
01:11:38 Just don't acknowledge it.
01:11:39 I know it feels good to have people by the thousands
01:11:42 flooding your replies saying how good you are.
01:11:44 But your long term, you're just making the problem worse.
01:11:47 Please just make more content
01:11:48 and focus on the people who resonate with it.
01:11:52 You're absolutely right, Tom.
01:11:53 Although it's the wrong thing.
01:11:56 I mean, she said in there,
01:11:57 I don't usually talk about personal stuff on her Twitter.
01:12:00 I don't know if I totally believe that.
01:12:01 Seems like she talks about some personal stuff on there
01:12:04 pretty frequently.
01:12:05 But, I mean, oh my God, I saw, okay,
01:12:09 you know what, I won't even get into it.
01:12:10 But I understand the desire to vent
01:12:15 on a social media platform
01:12:16 where people can respond to you in real time.
01:12:19 My God, what a technological wonderland we live in.
01:12:22 But it's-
01:12:23 You don't vent in public.
01:12:25 Vent to your friends.
01:12:26 Vent in your discord with your friends.
01:12:28 You are correct.
01:12:29 I saw-
01:12:30 Keep it out of the public eye.
01:12:31 I saw Patricia Taksin on Twitter just being like,
01:12:35 guys, I'm so depressed.
01:12:37 I hate myself.
01:12:38 And I just was like, ugh, bad luck.
01:12:41 You know, I just-
01:12:42 On a larger scale, this like depression meme-
01:12:45 Love, love, love her stuff, like her videos.
01:12:47 But I saw that Twitter and I was like, man,
01:12:49 I almost want to say like, please stop.
01:12:53 But I feel like it would be perceived as an attack
01:12:55 and I don't want to be that guy.
01:12:56 It would.
01:12:57 It certainly would.
01:12:59 You need to leave that to the meme boys.
01:13:00 I mean, the person making a tweet like that
01:13:02 is clearly already in a troubled headspace
01:13:04 and so they're probably not the most open
01:13:06 to constructive criticism at that point.
01:13:08 Yeah, exactly.
01:13:09 Yeah.
01:13:09 But you know, the thing is not to be an asshole about it,
01:13:13 but like, isn't this just a cry for attention
01:13:16 at the end of the day?
01:13:16 Well, that's the whole thing, right?
01:13:17 Is that like that?
01:13:18 Because even if it's not,
01:13:19 even if you're legitimately just frustrated
01:13:21 and trying to just like vent,
01:13:24 people, the people who you are complaining about
01:13:27 will see that tweet as a plea for attention
01:13:30 and double down on their negative opinion of you.
01:13:32 So you're doing yourself no favors.
01:13:35 This is why you got to play things close to the chest, people.
01:13:37 Don't let them know what you're thinking.
01:13:38 Don't let them feel, I mean, see.
01:13:41 Don't let them see that you are sad.
01:13:45 Talk less, smile more, don't let them know
01:13:49 what you're against or what you're full of.
01:13:51 I was literally going to say Aaron Burr
01:13:53 is the good role model for these things.
01:13:56 Oh, don't let them see.
01:13:57 Oh, you know, just about Visipop in general, though.
01:14:02 You know, I haven't been following it too much,
01:14:04 but it sounds like with Hasman Hotel,
01:14:06 if I understand it correctly,
01:14:08 I think she's getting shit on mostly from people
01:14:10 who like find her jokes like distasteful
01:14:12 or not politically correct.
01:14:14 Is that true?
01:14:15 That is some of that, yeah.
01:14:17 Isn't that true?
01:14:17 There's a lot of people
01:14:18 trashing her for her past since, so to speak,
01:14:21 but like she's apologized for those, I think, and she made up.
01:14:25 Don't apologize, you don't owe me an apology.
01:14:28 Sometimes you do things that should be apologized for.
01:14:31 Well, if she doesn't stand by her statements anymore,
01:14:34 like those statements were made like seven years ago
01:14:36 and she says that she doesn't stand by them anymore,
01:14:39 so I don't know why people keep giving her shit.
01:14:42 She used to say, stay strong, sister.
01:14:44 I don't like potatoes and all the potato fags came out.
01:14:48 The problem.
01:14:49 All the Irish were real pissed at that one.
01:14:50 Visipop is at the point now where she is popular enough
01:14:54 that people are gonna take pride in punching up at her.
01:14:58 This controversy is never going to go away.
01:15:00 You are never going to be forgiven
01:15:02 by this contingent and this kind of person.
01:15:04 So just stop acknowledging it.
01:15:06 You're big enough now that you have a huge amount of people
01:15:08 who genuinely like your work.
01:15:10 Focus on that.
01:15:11 There is no reason to get bogged down in minor controversy.
01:15:14 You're absolutely right.
01:15:15 When you get to a certain point, you'll always have haters.
01:15:20 This will never stop being a thing
01:15:21 and you can't apologize it away or whatever.
01:15:26 I haven't followed her career very closely,
01:15:27 but it seems like what the release of Has been,
01:15:29 she kind of was like, again, to give her credit,
01:15:31 I know she worked really hard on it,
01:15:32 but it's like a poor guy who wins the lottery
01:15:35 and is suddenly rich and is now surrounded by people
01:15:38 who want a piece or want to tear him down.
01:15:40 I mean, this isn't her first big project.
01:15:42 I mean, it's the biggest project she's done,
01:15:44 but it's not the first thing she's done
01:15:45 that's garnered a lot of attention.
01:15:47 Like back in 2013, 2014, that Kesha animation she did,
01:15:52 did gangbusters, had millions of views.
01:15:54 So she's no stranger to a successful project.
01:15:58 I see.
01:15:59 Well, you know what?
01:16:00 On that front, it might be more of maybe
01:16:01 a semi-cultural divide sort of thing,
01:16:03 because not to get into the issue or anything.
01:16:05 Here's my thing.
01:16:06 Just not to cut you off,
01:16:07 but I think the problem is that we already know
01:16:09 that this is a personal project for her.
01:16:10 50 million views on that thing.
01:16:13 Holy shit.
01:16:13 Yeah.
01:16:13 Holy shit.
01:16:15 But the thing is this has her OCs in it,
01:16:17 this is her personal project.
01:16:20 So I'm sure every detraction stings a lot more than like,
01:16:24 oh, you didn't like my Kesha animation, whatever.
01:16:27 Clearly, this is a much more like a personal stemming
01:16:31 from the heart kind of thing,
01:16:32 but that doesn't change the fact
01:16:33 that you're still doing yourself no favors
01:16:35 by complaining about it.
01:16:36 You're pragmatically speaking, you're absolutely right.
01:16:38 But it just reminds me of like, for example,
01:16:41 and again, not to open up the can of worms,
01:16:42 I just want to say that on the substance of the issue,
01:16:46 like when Vic Minyana was having his court case
01:16:50 and was being called a predator and all those things,
01:16:52 again, I don't care if it's true or not, not the issue.
01:16:54 But the point is that when the depositions were happening
01:16:59 and they asked Vic, the thing is,
01:17:01 Vic had made no public statements whatsoever
01:17:05 about all these accusations that he was like,
01:17:07 I mean, some people called him a pedophile, a rapist,
01:17:10 and even though those things are definitely exaggerated,
01:17:13 but it was the fact that he's definitely over 50.
01:17:17 He's of an older generation.
01:17:19 His approach was like, I'm just not going to talk about it.
01:17:21 Like, I will talk to my lawyer.
01:17:23 I'll let them sort this thing out.
01:17:24 Whereas nowadays, I think with our generation
01:17:27 and beyond and stuff, our instinct is like,
01:17:29 I'm just going to go to Twitter and get the people on my side.
01:17:35 Yeah, and I just don't think that's always the best move.
01:17:38 Yeah, but there's really no winning
01:17:39 because a lot of people say, oh,
01:17:42 then this person kept silent.
01:17:43 Why would you be silent?
01:17:44 Sounds suspicious.
01:17:45 Well, that's exactly my point.
01:17:47 Well, that's my entire point.
01:17:48 That's what Pro Jarrod did, and it worked out for him.
01:17:51 Eventually, with his...
01:17:52 Yeah, I mean, for a while, everyone was like,
01:17:54 oh, he's not saying anything.
01:17:56 He's guilty of non-crimes.
01:17:59 He had a statement, but then people ripped it apart
01:18:02 and he didn't follow it up.
01:18:03 He made a pretty shit statement.
01:18:05 Yeah, but he just...
01:18:06 That's true.
01:18:08 He talked to his lawyer.
01:18:09 He literally said, with style and brakes,
01:18:12 you don't give yourself any rope to hang yourself with.
01:18:15 He literally said in that statement,
01:18:17 I hope, first, to exit this marriage with style and grace,
01:18:20 which is a funky, a lanky con quote,
01:18:23 which I assume was unintentional.
01:18:24 I don't think he said style and grace.
01:18:26 I'm telling you, Ben, he said style and grace.
01:18:29 That's the word to use.
01:18:30 No, he did not say style and grace.
01:18:33 That's insanity.
01:18:34 It's impossible.
01:18:34 Someone verified.
01:18:35 Someone in the comments will tell us who's wrong, who's right.
01:18:39 And to think, we got onto the full tangent
01:18:41 by acknowledging style and flair, just like the nanny.
01:18:46 Not like lanky con at all.
01:18:47 Very distinct.
01:18:49 And to think that we got onto this whole tangent
01:18:50 by acknowledging the reality
01:18:51 that Vizipop does, in fact, fuck dogs.
01:18:53 Yeah, well, you know.
01:18:54 Fascinating.
01:18:54 It's a fascinating term.
01:18:55 Just look at her.
01:18:56 You know she can see it in her eyes.
01:18:57 You know, bro.
01:18:59 That's so nice.
01:19:00 You can see it in her eyes and in her...
01:19:02 Yes, it's not a value judgment.
01:19:05 It's neutral.
01:19:06 It's not bad or good that Vizipop obviously
01:19:08 is a white girl who fucks Donna.
01:19:09 All cultures are equally beautiful.
01:19:11 It's just a fact.
01:19:15 All right.
01:19:15 Well, anyway, let's move on to our next voicemail, shall we?
01:19:17 This one is from...
01:19:19 Let me see.
01:19:20 Oh, it's a Coomers Rise Up is our title.
01:19:23 Let's hear what they have to say for themselves.
01:19:26 Go.
01:19:26 There was this guy last week talking
01:19:28 about how he has so much willpower
01:19:30 because he did know not November.
01:19:32 Well, I was a proud Coomer.
01:19:33 I just want to say that I have coomed
01:19:35 every fucking day of my life
01:19:37 because I'm not a little bitch.
01:19:39 I have so much willpower
01:19:40 that I'm constantly cooming nonstop.
01:19:43 I have a hashtag not never, never
01:19:46 because I'm never not nutty.
01:19:48 You're a little bitch and a little bitch.
01:19:50 And as Endless Jess would say, a little bitch.
01:19:54 He would say that.
01:19:55 He would.
01:19:57 Well...
01:19:57 You do your people a service.
01:19:59 What do we make of this?
01:20:00 With your advocacy.
01:20:02 Makes sense to me.
01:20:02 I'm convinced.
01:20:03 You can support.
01:20:04 I guess.
01:20:05 Yeah.
01:20:05 Hard support.
01:20:07 It's, it's...
01:20:08 Coomer's...
01:20:08 Proud of, proud of your boy.
01:20:13 I'm so proud of my Coomer boy.
01:20:15 All right.
01:20:15 Well, obviously he's won us all over.
01:20:17 Voice Grail, we'll come back to that later.
01:20:19 All right.
01:20:19 Let's go to our next one, which is the Muppet Hater.
01:20:23 Right.
01:20:23 Okay.
01:20:23 The Muppet Hater is calling in.
01:20:26 What do you have to say?
01:20:27 Let's find out.
01:20:28 Brothers, I have one question to ask you.
01:20:31 When you guide your thumbs down the queues
01:20:35 of your selection of YouTube videos
01:20:37 that you can spend your time watching
01:20:38 in the most skillful and masterful and expert way possible.
01:20:42 Right.
01:20:42 Right.
01:20:42 That's it.
01:20:43 How do we keep falling for Arlo fucking videos?
01:20:48 How many times am I going to let this blue motherfucker tell me
01:20:53 that I want more Paper Mario?
01:20:55 When ain't no more Paper Mario coming down the fucking pipeline
01:20:59 and tell me how he's won.
01:21:00 But Pikmin 4, when ain't no goddamn Pikmin 4
01:21:04 in a billion years.
01:21:06 How long are we going to put up with this bullshit?
01:21:08 It's been since 2013.
01:21:11 How long are we going to let this blue puppet dictate our lives?
01:21:14 Rise up.
01:21:15 Get away with it.
01:21:16 Rise up.
01:21:17 Well, listen, the problem, the problem is you hit the three buttons,
01:21:20 the three dots, and then say, don't recommend this channel.
01:21:23 And then it goes away.
01:21:24 Arlo, it's the only way.
01:21:25 Arlo called me a great Keto pizza crust recipe.
01:21:29 So I can't hate it.
01:21:29 I can't hate him.
01:21:31 It's I can't do it.
01:21:33 Well, I have no choice but to stand.
01:21:35 You know, I think I might just figure out how to make a puppet puppet of my own.
01:21:45 But Red Man.
01:21:46 So Red Man will fight Arlo as being the red guy.
01:21:50 And he'll be like, oh, I like video games.
01:21:53 Duh.
01:21:53 Fuck you, idiot.
01:21:55 I hate video games.
01:21:56 I unironically endorse this opinion.
01:21:58 Can you please make a YouTube channel for Red Man?
01:22:02 Red Man has to review video games.
01:22:04 Red Man has a channel where he reviews video games.
01:22:06 He reviewed Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu.
01:22:10 Remember that?
01:22:11 Oh, yeah.
01:22:12 Oh my god.
01:22:12 Can you get the link to that?
01:22:13 Because I forget about that.
01:22:15 I think I type in Red Man into Google.
01:22:22 Can Red Man review the classic Showa Tokusatsu series called Red Man?
01:22:30 Um.
01:22:31 That does sound like a winner.
01:22:32 Yeah, maybe.
01:22:33 Wait, there is a channel called Red Man who has a video called Pokemon Facts,
01:22:38 OSM Fact Galaxy, Red Fact One, Factor Red Man.
01:22:43 How many fucking facts?
01:22:45 I don't know what that is, but that sounds awesome as well.
01:22:49 Link that back.
01:22:49 Guys, look at this.
01:22:51 What the fuck is this?
01:22:53 This is incredible.
01:22:54 Okay, I love this.
01:22:55 Post the damn.
01:22:57 Okay, here it is.
01:22:58 Like Pokemon, like actually watch this.
01:23:01 Actually watch this fucking video.
01:23:03 Holy shit.
01:23:04 Oh god.
01:23:07 Oh, that's not English.
01:23:08 Not a fan.
01:23:09 Definitely not.
01:23:10 Oh my god.
01:23:11 I got a collab.
01:23:12 We got a collab, by the way.
01:23:13 You have to collab.
01:23:14 This is this is Red Red Man reviews Pokemon Let's Go.
01:23:18 Okay.
01:23:19 Excellent.
01:23:20 That legendary icon I haven't seen in so long.
01:23:24 I forgot about this.
01:23:26 These facts do not have anything to do with Pokemon, by the way.
01:23:30 Why is there a guy with a pin stuck in his collar,
01:23:32 like pointing directly at his jugular vein?
01:23:34 What is the fact?
01:23:35 Why are these red facts?
01:23:36 Is this like a blood fact or something?
01:23:39 What is this?
01:23:39 Oh god.
01:23:41 This makes me so happy.
01:23:43 Okay.
01:23:43 Okay, please collab the two Red Men.
01:23:47 I don't appreciate it very much.
01:23:48 Sorry, I've never made a video.
01:23:49 All right, go watch these incredible videos, everybody.
01:23:57 Red Man's so funny.
01:23:57 You won't regret it.
01:24:00 Is he just gradually getting wide?
01:24:08 It's the simple things.
01:24:10 All right, let's next voicemail.
01:24:11 Let's go.
01:24:12 We got a couple more.
01:24:13 All right, guys, I'm proud to announce that people at home watch.
01:24:17 I mean, definitely watch Red Reviews,
01:24:19 but also please watch Red Facts with Pokemon Facts with Red Man,
01:24:24 Red Fact 1, OSM Fact Galaxy.
01:24:27 Wait, wait, look at the description.
01:24:29 Red Man, some sort of Arabic or whatever.
01:24:31 Welcome to Red Man Channel, also Red Man here.
01:24:34 Red Scribe here.
01:24:38 You got to Red Scribe, everybody.
01:24:40 Everyone at Red Scribe, and he links to a channel that does not exist.
01:24:46 Damn.
01:24:47 This was posted like a month ago.
01:24:51 This is like new.
01:24:52 Oh my god, is it based on the lore?
01:24:53 Is it based?
01:24:54 Oh, it's based on the lore.
01:24:56 It's based for no doubt.
01:24:58 Oh, it has one like?
01:24:59 Well, guess what?
01:24:59 Now it's got two, baby.
01:25:02 Let's see how high we can get that.
01:25:04 Let's encourage him to make more.
01:25:07 All right, voicemail.
01:25:08 As I was saying, I'm happy to announce the end of an arc, guys.
01:25:11 It is the voicemail god final voicemail.
01:25:14 At long last, we can wrap this up and move on with our lives.
01:25:18 Let's hear what he has to say.
01:25:20 Go.
01:25:20 Hey, what's up, PCP?
01:25:22 It's your voicemail god here to explain myself.
01:25:25 So basically the whole premise of this thing,
01:25:29 it wasn't just to randomly, oh, guess who I am?
01:25:32 I was supposed to give you hints each week.
01:25:34 That was the plan, at least.
01:25:35 Maybe you guys forgot or whatever.
01:25:37 It's fine.
01:25:37 Doesn't matter.
01:25:38 Anyways, by the time you listen to this,
01:25:41 Nate will know who the voicemail god is.
01:25:43 So I figured I would get the cat out of the bag.
01:25:45 Voicemail god is me.
01:25:48 It's Sean, S-E-A-N.
01:25:51 Nate, obviously, I think you know me by now.
01:25:53 Of course, everyone's favorite.
01:25:54 Ben, I always show up to your screens
01:25:56 and ask how today's episode of PCP was.
01:25:59 And maybe you can hit the bell.
01:26:01 What a revelation.
01:26:01 I know this guy.
01:26:03 You know, pretty epic.
01:26:03 Yeah.
01:26:05 Anyways, I figured.
01:26:06 See, that's the thing.
01:26:07 He's a viewer.
01:26:07 What better way to send this shit out?
01:26:09 A real viewer?
01:26:11 I'm all my voicemails over the past 23 episodes.
01:26:15 Sounds good.
01:26:16 So, I hope you're ready.

01:26:40 Voicemail Introduction.
01:26:41 On Ironic Gang, we guide you.
01:26:42 Eager of voicemail god redemption.
01:26:44 And hopefully this voicemail.
01:26:47 Thank you, guys.
01:26:49 Thank you.
01:26:50 Thank you.
01:26:51 You're welcome.
01:26:51 Thank you.
01:26:52 That's a lot of voicemails.
01:26:53 That's a lot of voicemails.
01:26:55 He did it.
01:26:56 That's a lot of great memories made over these 23 weeks.
01:27:02 It's sad to see the finale, but everyone, I'm happy to announce.
01:27:06 By donating.
01:27:07 Oh, Ben, you didn't see it.
01:27:09 Yesterday, there was an intense bidding war in the Nuzlocke for the name of my rival,
01:27:14 the Ben St. Socialism Boys.
01:27:16 We're going hard to try to get the rival named Ben St.
01:27:19 But alas, capitalism went out.
01:27:21 By donating over 100 of his own dollars, the voicemail god has become the rival in the heart gold.
01:27:27 Fuck you, buddy.
01:27:28 He went ham, man.
01:27:29 He's so gay.
01:27:30 That's fucking gay as hell.
01:27:32 And I'm not going to take it anymore.
01:27:34 Oh, but you'll be happy to know, Ben, that because you were the next donation down,
01:27:38 Ben St. has become a lowly hoot-hoot who will almost surely be boxed instantly.
01:27:42 That's so bad and dumb, and it would have been way better for me to be the rival.
01:27:46 And I hate you, Sean.
01:27:47 Don't ever fucking come around here anymore.
01:27:49 Don't underestimate hoot-hoots, though.
01:27:52 They can, like, hypnosis.
01:27:53 They can toot-toot.
01:27:55 That's true.
01:27:55 Oh, they can, dude, every time.
01:27:56 Yeah, he can hypnosis.
01:27:58 Dude, have Ben St. the hoot-hoot use hypnosis to fucking cheese your way through every battle.
01:28:03 Perhaps I will.
01:28:03 Just keep doing it until he dies.
01:28:05 Just go hard.
01:28:07 That's okay.
01:28:08 We've got the endorsement, kill Ben St. the hoot-hoot understood.
01:28:12 We'll do.
01:28:13 Do not switch him out under any circumstances.
01:28:18 Let me see.
01:28:18 We've got another one here.
01:28:19 Ah, this one's in keeping with the season as well.
01:28:21 This is a very procrastinated Christmas.
01:28:25 Oh, I'm excited.
01:28:26 Okay, and go.
01:28:27 It's 2018 Christmas.
01:28:31 Okay, before I start, Ben, you're going to have to leave the room.
01:28:35 Trust me on this.
01:28:36 It's for your own good.
01:28:36 Should I actually?
01:28:37 Of course.
01:28:38 Uh, no.
01:28:39 Okay.
01:28:40 Pretend that you did.
01:28:41 Okay, guys, Christmas is right around the corner,
01:28:43 and we all got to talk about Ben's gift.
01:28:45 So what's going to happen is tomorrow we're going to do the Communist Revolution.
01:28:50 We're going to keep it way on the down low so Ben doesn't find out.
01:28:54 And then on Christmas morning, we'll be doing our usual Christmas tradition,
01:28:58 you know, watching End of A. Vangelion and our PJs and drinking our eggnog flavor fuel,
01:29:04 keto cinnamon rolls.
01:29:06 This time when the song is playing,
01:29:08 well, I'll turn to Ben and did you say,
01:29:10 hey, Ben, you know what else came tumbling down over the weekend?
01:29:14 And Ben'll be all confused and go like, what?
01:29:18 And then Nate, smiling big, will say,
01:29:20 capitalism, bro.
01:29:23 Merry Christmas.
01:29:24 Merry Christmas, Ben's saying.
01:29:26 Shade of black.
01:29:27 Hey, Ben, you're good to come back in now.
01:29:30 God bless us.
01:29:31 Okay, well then later, guys.
01:29:34 Let's make this a good one.
01:29:35 Happy holidays.
01:29:37 Happy Christmas.
01:29:38 Happy Kwanzaa.
01:29:40 I won't tell anyone that I heard it all.
01:29:44 I'm just going to be sitting there on Christmas morning.
01:29:46 I'm just going to be like smugly looking at the chimney like, oh yeah, I totally don't know.
01:29:51 There's an extra present waiting for me.
01:29:54 It's the fucking end of fight club out the window right now.
01:29:57 I was going to say, yeah, we open the door and the financial institutions are collapsing one by one.
01:30:03 What a wonderful, heartwarming time that'll be.
01:30:05 I can't wait for Karl Marx to come down our chimney in his traditional red.
01:30:09 Oh, it's going to be beautiful.
01:30:10 Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much what it would be like.
01:30:12 That's pretty much it.
01:30:14 Sweet Communist, the Communist daughter.
01:30:18 Who knew that Santa Claus was Karl Marx the whole time?
01:30:21 I suspected it, but I never had the courage.
01:30:23 We all in our hearts, we knew all along.
01:30:27 He does take from no one and gives to everyone.
01:30:30 According to their needs.
01:30:34 According to their $1,000 dividend.
01:30:37 Yeah, yeah, according to Yum.
01:30:38 All right, I would like to start a potential new segment of the PCP.
01:30:44 This is a trial run.
01:30:45 Okay.
01:30:45 It's called the cool drawing that I post on Twitter this week.
01:30:51 Okay.
01:30:51 Oh, good.
01:30:52 Yeah.
01:30:53 Sure.
01:30:54 Sure.
01:30:54 Oh, I saw this.
01:30:55 I like this.
01:30:55 It was looking excellent.
01:30:57 Pump is particularly aesthetic and I dig it.
01:30:59 Yes.
01:31:00 Oh, I like the last one.
01:31:01 What's the Cowboy's name, the girl?
01:31:03 Clarissa.
01:31:05 Clarissa.
01:31:06 She's going to explain it all via bullets.
01:31:08 That's going to be great.
01:31:09 What's the last one?
01:31:10 Oh, that's a dead guy.
01:31:14 My favorite.
01:31:14 It gives me like Samurai Jack vibes.
01:31:16 I like it.
01:31:17 Yeah, he's very much one of those kinds.
01:31:19 His leg looks a lot like that.
01:31:20 I was just sort of doodling and it was like,
01:31:22 hey, you know what?
01:31:23 I can doodle now.
01:31:24 It's like a skill I have and it's good.
01:31:27 Hmm.
01:31:28 I mentioned pump is very vulnerable to that rain.
01:31:31 So keep that hood on, sis.
01:31:33 Don't want to die yet again.
01:31:35 An alley-oop with that football.
01:31:37 She's going to alley-oop that.
01:31:38 Definitely for the touchdown.
01:31:40 Can't wait.
01:31:41 Can't wait.
01:31:41 It looks like a big smile, but I know it's not.
01:31:45 It's like it's the thing with the helmet, right?
01:31:47 Oh, it's like a weird big smile with big thick lips.
01:31:49 Oh, don't make me think about that.
01:31:53 Don't make me consider that possibility.
01:31:56 All right, next voicemail.
01:31:58 I thought that was the end of the voicemails.
01:32:00 I was going to do the segment afterwards.
01:32:01 We have two more as it happens.
01:32:04 This one is, what is this?
01:32:06 Oh, okay.
01:32:06 So this guy, this is the true chronicles of an American hero.
01:32:10 And this is a good one.
01:32:11 He had left three, but I thought this was the best one,
01:32:13 episode one.
01:32:14 And you could leave one next time,
01:32:16 but three in a row would be too many for one episode.
01:32:17 So feel free to leave more, but only one this time.
01:32:20 Okay, two chronicles of an American hero, episode one, commence.
01:32:26 It's Friday night.
01:32:27 I'm chilling upstairs in my man cave
01:32:29 as the red-pilled mctaug icon I am.
01:32:33 Listening to my favorite group of sexy twinks
01:32:35 talking their alt-right podcast, the PCP.
01:32:39 Suddenly I hear a noise, like the screams of two Palestinian
01:32:44 children as Gal Gadot stands over their broken thoughts.
01:32:48 I zoom down the stairs and find a masked man
01:32:53 dressed somewhere in between a pimp and a civil war reenactor
01:32:56 led pipe in hand.
01:32:57 He's broken through my door and is coming for me,
01:33:00 but I have a trick up my sleeve.
01:33:02 I pull out my trusty slap bracelet.
01:33:04 I keep in my underwear at all times and slice open his neck,
01:33:07 the blood covering the entire neighborhood.
01:33:10 While I'm going through his wallet after I absorbed his experience
01:33:13 points of cocaine, I find his address.
01:33:16 I put those crack perk points in the stealth
01:33:18 and bomb over to his house where his mom is waiting.
01:33:21 She tries to seduce me when she sees my striking masculine form,
01:33:24 but I say the gamer word of power in the entire house
01:33:28 is wiped out of existence.
01:33:29 Reduce the rubble that smells like a mixture of sweat and broccoli,
01:33:33 because then I return home and finish my podcast
01:33:36 like a true American hero.
01:33:40 All right.
01:33:42 A true text of heroism.
01:33:45 And that's America in a nutshell.
01:33:46 That's a way to go, dude.
01:33:47 That's a proud of your boy.
01:33:51 The only thing that would have made that better
01:33:53 is if he donated to the patron.com slash PCP,
01:33:57 I mean, the procrastination.
01:33:58 Hey, once that American podcast is done,
01:34:00 why not sit back with some good old fashioned Minecraft?
01:34:05 Indeed, patron.com slash PCP Minecraft, everybody.
01:34:06 We can accommodate that need.
01:34:09 Naturally, naturally.
01:34:11 Well, leave more because that was great,
01:34:13 but make them good or I will not play them.
01:34:15 Okay, anyway, we've got one more.
01:34:18 Now, okay.
01:34:19 Now, this may sound redundant to everybody.
01:34:21 So this is from a guy named Tom.
01:34:22 This is from Tom.
01:34:23 That's pretty redundant.
01:34:24 I don't think we need another one.
01:34:25 It's pretty redundant.
01:34:25 Yeah, one's enough.
01:34:28 So this is a longer than normal voicemail that was sent to me.
01:34:31 He actually sent a link through the speak pipe.
01:34:35 The email address or his name was a link to the full file.
01:34:39 So you can do that too, by the way.
01:34:40 It actually worked out well, but it's several minutes long.
01:34:45 And I'll stop it short if you want,
01:34:46 but I'm happy to play the full thing if everybody likes it.
01:34:49 So if we wanted to stop it, just let me know and I'll cut it off.
01:34:51 But I think you'll enjoy it.
01:34:53 So here we go.
01:34:54 This is from Tom.
01:34:55 Merry Christmas, everyone.
01:34:57 Hey, procrastinators, this is Tom.
01:34:59 There's been something I've been meaning to get off my chest
01:35:01 for quite some time now.
01:35:02 So I think it's about time I say it.
01:35:04 And the only way I know how,
01:35:06 through Vocaloid Parody Song, enjoy.
01:35:10 Yes.
01:35:11 Oh, I want to sit down and relax.
01:35:16 I'll put on the PZP.
01:35:20 I don't want to hear that bullshit.
01:35:23 That face be on MTV.
01:35:26 There is just one problem though.
01:35:30 There's one member with no soul.
01:35:34 I think we all know who the one I hate is.
01:35:40 No, I thought I was going to say that.
01:35:46 No, no more.
01:36:10 Best guy's brother is Van Saint.
01:36:13 Horror images of a man.
01:36:17 These are just some serfless flaws.
01:36:20 I can't just move past them all.
01:36:23 He's worse than Jeff Lou.
01:36:26 He's the same thing as J.W. Lou.
01:36:36 All right, there's more.
01:36:37 Let me tell you all the ways that Van Saint is a little bitch.
01:36:44 Every PZP episode is his personal sales pitch.
01:36:51 I know, but he first all makes sick J's.
01:36:54 He is worse than the third drive.
01:36:57 You only hear his stupid bitching through his shitty USB.
01:37:05 He is worse than the third drive.
01:37:09 Oh, my God.
01:37:27 This is the whole song.
01:37:29 It's the whole song.
01:37:35 And we'll bring the apocalypse.
01:37:39 It was a clear hello cost.
01:37:43 Humanity ever lost.
01:37:46 Ben's not who he seems to be.
01:37:48 He's eight and secretly.
01:37:50 Before he evolves, someone kill him quickly.
01:37:54 Antichrist is not slain while he looks like a man child.
01:38:00 He will be too late for us all.
01:38:04 Our innocent defile his patriotism.
01:38:10 To wake his evil with him.
01:38:14 The end doesn't involve you.
01:38:18 Kill Ben Saint before me.
01:38:22 Yes, yes.
01:38:24 He kills you.
01:38:28 Kill Ben Saint before he kills you.
01:38:34 Best guy, kill Ben Saint before he kills you.
01:38:42 Jesse, kill Ben Saint before he kills you.
01:38:48 Kill Ben Saint before he kills you.
01:38:58 More, more, more, more.
01:39:00 I can't get enough.
01:39:02 All right.
01:39:04 We're fading.
01:39:10 Wow, I'm feeling the holiday spirit now.
01:39:12 Tom, why was that so epic?
01:39:16 It sounded more flatter than I was.
01:39:18 How did they do that?
01:39:20 He made it with a Vocaloid or something.
01:39:22 That sounded so good.
01:39:24 Vocaloid, not like a Utau or Utau.
01:39:26 He said a Vocaloid.
01:39:28 By the way, this guy's name is Tom.
01:39:30 He asked us to kindly link his YouTube channel with 117 subs.
01:39:34 I watch, he makes memes.
01:39:36 He is a funny guy.
01:39:38 Go check this guy out, link in the description or something.
01:39:40 Incredible.
01:39:42 He put so much work into that.
01:39:44 Is that song a video? Can I like tweet that or something?
01:39:48 It actually, I looked, it's not a video on his channel,
01:39:50 but you should make a video out of it, Tom,
01:39:52 as soon as you hear this.
01:39:54 So we can put it in the description.
01:39:56 Why does Ben have two songs of high quality about him now?
01:40:00 It's so bad.
01:40:02 What is it about Ben that inspires such creativity?
01:40:04 It's the rage.
01:40:06 It's the fierce hatred.
01:40:08 It's, you know, I'm a divisive figure, right?
01:40:12 Everyone's got to have a take on Ben saying.
01:40:16 You'd rather, what is it?
01:40:18 It's better to be hated than not to be remembered at all, you know?
01:40:22 Something like that.
01:40:24 That's what I'm going for.
01:40:26 And also, I said, that's two parodies of Mariah Carey's
01:40:30 All I Want for Christmas, this very fucking episode,
01:40:33 but it is the quintessential Christmas song,
01:40:35 and Christmas is in a few short days,
01:40:37 so I guess we'll leave it at that.
01:40:39 Next PCP that people will be hearing.
01:40:41 Not the one we will be hearing, but people will be hearing,
01:40:43 will be the last PCP of the year.
01:40:45 Yes, yes.
01:40:47 I will not be present, sadly, for real this time.
01:40:49 Oh, okay.
01:40:51 Tickets are bought.
01:40:53 I will not be present.
01:40:55 But yeah, so people who are going to send in voicemails,
01:40:58 just know your voicemail will be on the last PCP of the year,
01:41:01 so make it good.
01:41:03 Make it amazing.
01:41:05 Make it all Mariah Carey parodies.
01:41:07 And you know what?
01:41:09 This is actually very useful.
01:41:11 Okay, so it's hard for people,
01:41:13 like a couple people actually center point,
01:41:15 send me his on-disc or whatever, don't do that.
01:41:17 Put a link to it on SpeakPipe,
01:41:20 like from a SoundCloud,
01:41:22 or you can put the URL exactly the way Tom did.
01:41:24 He's pioneering new smart things.
01:41:26 His actual voicemail was like a,
01:41:28 hey, just Nate, so you know this is a link,
01:41:30 so you can click on this link and get the audio.
01:41:32 Like that works perfectly. Do that.
01:41:34 That was convenient and easy to do.
01:41:36 It was great. It was great.
01:41:38 So keep the quality coming everybody.
01:41:40 Incredible work Tom, incredible work every center point.
01:41:42 We appreciate your song as well.
01:41:44 Everybody else, good stuff.
01:41:46 Quality voicemails today.
01:41:48 I was enjoying most of them.
01:41:50 And so SpeakPipe, link down below
01:41:52 to leave your voicemails.
01:41:54 And of course, yeah, yeah.
01:41:56 All those Mariah Carey, all that one for Christmases,
01:41:58 reminds me of this one video,
01:42:00 which I would have linked in the show notes
01:42:04 for people to listen to,
01:42:06 a TF2 parody of all I want for Christmas.
01:42:09 And it's really funny.
01:42:11 I listen to it every year.
01:42:13 I hear it.
01:42:15 I'm going to play this for the fam on Christmas Day
01:42:17 as we all jam out.
01:42:19 Oh, this is great. I love it.
01:42:21 So there you go, everybody. Get in the Christmas spirit.
