00:00:00 I won't bless that guy. That son of a-
00:00:02 That son of a-
00:00:04 That son of a-
00:00:06 That son of a-
00:00:08 That son of a-
00:00:10 Son of a-
00:00:12 Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:18 Crastinators, ah, I thought you wanted me to do that.
00:00:20 The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:24 The Pro Crastinators Podcast, I'm Ben Saint.
00:00:26 The Pro, ah, Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:29 Ben St. and Gibb and Tate are here after a one week hiatus.
00:00:37 Was there a week hiatus?
00:00:38 Well, there was a week between the last time we recorded and.
00:00:41 Oh, I see.
00:00:43 The usual week, one week hiatus.
00:00:46 This is zero second hiatus.
00:00:48 We weren't we weren't gone.
00:00:51 Well, we were recording.
00:00:52 We're just on schedule.
00:00:54 Well, we're recording a day late because you were traveling or something.
00:00:58 I was sleepy is that's the truth.
00:01:01 That's the whole that's the whole thing.
00:01:03 No, that's all there is to it.
00:01:05 I was coming home from camp and so we could record the normal time.
00:01:10 Was it and it was going to be a later recording.
00:01:13 But then I was like, was it the gunnery?
00:01:18 It wasn't a gunnery.
00:01:18 That's a summer camp.
00:01:20 It was just we have a Christmas camp as well.
00:01:23 A Christmas camp, which we just call Christmas camp.
00:01:26 It's just like in December get a, you know, everyone has a good old Christmas fun.
00:01:33 There's some activities and a Christmas dinner on the last day.
00:01:38 It's really just a stay for a night thing in like cabin somewhere.
00:01:43 Yeah.
00:01:44 OK, OK, like a family thing.
00:01:47 I know the it's the scout group.
00:01:50 Oh, yeah.
00:01:51 That I volunteer at.
00:01:52 So it's the same like general scout sort of stuff.
00:01:57 Yeah, help out with the other mentally disabled children.
00:02:03 And I make sure that they don't, you know, do anything fucking stupid.
00:02:08 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:02:10 Definitely, definitely.
00:02:12 I make sure they have a lovely time, but it was very fucking tiring
00:02:16 because there was a there was a kid who is very hyper
00:02:20 and needs constant supervision.
00:02:22 So I needed to do a lot of that.
00:02:23 And by the time I got back, I was like, fuck, I don't want to do a fucking podcast.
00:02:26 No, no.
00:02:28 OK, that makes that makes sense.
00:02:30 OK, I see. Yeah, I didn't know what you were up to.
00:02:33 I just knew you had come back from somewhere.
00:02:36 Yeah, cool, cool, cool.
00:02:41 Oh, I finished your lecture.
00:02:42 I actually got to the end.
00:02:44 Yeah, how well, I mean, I hope you had a good time.
00:02:49 Hope you enjoyed learning about.
00:02:51 Yeah, stuff.
00:02:53 My favorite thing is is the connections from previous characters,
00:02:58 like the fact that, you know, everything's so connected.
00:03:03 Even though the generally the law is
00:03:06 or the story of each game is you're a little guy
00:03:10 and you've got to stop a certain number of similar guys that have different powers.
00:03:15 Yeah, go get them.
00:03:16 And like, that's every single game, but the story and the law is like
00:03:20 it keeps expanding on itself.
00:03:22 Yeah, I do like how like it goes from like there are humans
00:03:27 and they build robots and then there's the whole thing with the reploids
00:03:32 and then the carbons at the end.
00:03:33 Yeah, it's like, yeah, the what would happen if what would happen
00:03:37 if robots became so smart?
00:03:40 The the thing the thing about the carbons is that
00:03:45 because they were made like first.
00:03:47 So it's really it's really kind of tenuous to draw the connection.
00:03:52 You can kind of see it if you if you take a step back and look at the whole thing,
00:03:55 you can kind of see that they were doing something.
00:03:58 I hear people talk about the end of ZX Advent and be like, oh, well,
00:04:04 yeah, I think, you know, maybe.
00:04:07 Oh, all those like human body parts and the immortal reploid DNA
00:04:11 that he says he's got like somewhere in a vault somewhere.
00:04:15 Like maybe he used those to like build the first prototype
00:04:20 and throw units, which became the carbons.
00:04:23 And it's like, yeah, yeah, maybe.
00:04:26 Yeah, it's possibly.
00:04:27 But like, you know, who really knows?
00:04:32 Because like, yeah, the legends is like XXX DX.
00:04:36 Legends is way, way, way more than 9000 the year, 9999.
00:04:41 It could be. It could be.
00:04:43 But. Yeah, it was all.
00:04:46 But it was also made like before it was made before zero.
00:04:50 It was made before into creates started like zero and ZX.
00:04:54 So basically, Capcom told them like, yeah, OK, here's Mega Man X.
00:05:01 This is the the canon.
00:05:02 And then here's legends.
00:05:04 And we've decided that legends takes place in the future.
00:05:08 And we didn't think about it any further than that.
00:05:10 So just go wild.
00:05:11 And they were like into creates just kind of had to be like,
00:05:15 well, how can we how can we?
00:05:19 How can we establish some connections between these two things?
00:05:22 And they they did an admirable job.
00:05:25 And I think people are probably onto something with that thing
00:05:28 about like Thomas Thomas's threat at the end of ZX Advent
00:05:32 being related to the prototype and through a unit project.
00:05:36 That seems like it makes a lot of sense, but it is ultimately speculation.
00:05:42 Yeah, that's just I wish we got ZXC wish we got wish we got Legends three.
00:05:49 Yeah, hearing from Twitch last week about the the the the the fall of Inafune
00:05:55 was really it's really depressing.
00:05:58 It's even it just gets more depressing the more I learn about it.
00:06:00 Yeah, I I mean.
00:06:03 I like what is Mega Man currently?
00:06:09 What is a Mega Man?
00:06:10 A mega pile of secret, a mega pile of mega lore.
00:06:18 A pile of scrap serotonium.
00:06:21 Like he he was fired or I forget.
00:06:25 But like basically fired from Capcom.
00:06:27 Yeah, for his for his for his cheeky monkey behavior
00:06:32 of of of of getting games made that are successful.
00:06:38 And they didn't like that.
00:06:40 But now what is the IP of Mega Man doing?
00:06:44 Has there been a game since he left or yeah?
00:06:46 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sitting on it.
00:06:48 Well, yes.
00:06:51 After he left, which I think was in around was it around like 2008,
00:06:54 2010, something like that?
00:06:57 Because that was when all the projects started getting canceled.
00:07:01 Yeah, there was.
00:07:04 I think after he left, they they did Mega Man not
00:07:08 well, nine and 10 and 11 have all come out in like not recently.
00:07:12 But like, I think those are all post in a Fune.
00:07:15 At least 11 is post in a Fune, for sure.
00:07:19 OK.
00:07:21 That has.
00:07:22 Has it been 12 years since Mega Man 10?
00:07:25 What the fuck?
00:07:27 I remember Mega Man like being talked about on YouTube early on,
00:07:33 because like everyone likes Mega Man.
00:07:35 I never heard about it before.
00:07:37 I saw lots of like videos that YouTube music.
00:07:40 You'd never you'd never heard about it?
00:07:42 Never heard.
00:07:43 Well, maybe I'd seen him in like a gaming magazine,
00:07:46 but I didn't have an NES or any of that.
00:07:48 Oh, yeah. OK. Yeah.
00:07:50 I was I was growing up in the time where like Ray Man was the hot shit
00:07:54 and Tomb Raider was all over the place.
00:07:56 That's I mean, I had.
00:07:59 I had I had a like computer.
00:08:01 I had like a PC demo disc that had a bunch of game demos on them.
00:08:06 And I had a demo for Ray Man, I think the first Ray Man.
00:08:10 And it ran really badly on that computer.
00:08:13 So I thought Ray Man's.
00:08:15 Oh, yeah. Sucked ass because it was like at like 15 frames per second.
00:08:20 The PC port of Ray Man.
00:08:22 I don't know if it was a bad port, but I remember trying to play that
00:08:26 on a really shitty laptop and it just wasn't very good.
00:08:29 It was OK.
00:08:30 But, you know, I tried to play it and I played it a bit
00:08:34 and it was quite hard and the frame rate was bad.
00:08:35 And I think I don't know if I ever beat the demo or if I just gave up on it.
00:08:39 I think there were other games that I liked more.
00:08:42 But yeah, I remember Mega Man 10 or 9.
00:08:46 What was the newest like the old it was it was newly made,
00:08:51 but looks like an NES game. That was well, that was 9 and 10.
00:08:54 Yeah. So I remember that those coming out and being everyone being like,
00:08:58 oh, my God, they're doing it. Yeah.
00:09:01 But it's old fashioned.
00:09:03 I'm like, who's Mega Man?
00:09:04 And they said, shut the fuck up, get out of here, get out the fuck out of our forum.
00:09:09 You idiot. Mm hmm.
00:09:11 They were right. They were right to say it.
00:09:13 Or wait, no, eight. Eight was the one.
00:09:16 Eight was in. Eight was in 97 or 96.
00:09:20 Oh, my God. And then nine was in nine was the first retro one
00:09:25 or the first recent retro one in 2008, 14 years ago.
00:09:29 So not that recent.
00:09:30 And then 10 was in, I think it was in 2010.
00:09:36 And then they didn't do it for like literally 10 years.
00:09:40 These yeah, 10 was in 2010 and 11.
00:09:43 No, 11 was in 2018.
00:09:45 They went eight years without a new Mega Man game.
00:09:49 And then they went and they've gone another
00:09:51 they've gone another four or five years since then or four.
00:09:54 Oh, yeah, four years.
00:09:55 But apparently there is and I heard this in my discord.
00:09:59 Apparently there is internal documents talking about something
00:10:03 that is internally referred to by something called,
00:10:07 and I hope I remember this correctly.
00:10:08 I think it was called like Mega Man, Tensai.
00:10:11 And that's not an official name.
00:10:13 It's just an internal name for something.
00:10:14 But apparently whatever it is has the biggest budget
00:10:18 of any Mega Man game ever made.
00:10:20 So something is being worked on, which is very.
00:10:24 Omega Man, it's a new Mega Man.
00:10:26 And he's going to be Omega and Oh, zero.
00:10:30 I'm thinking of another thing for zero equivalent.
00:10:35 Well, you know, I mean, there is Omega.
00:10:38 Oh, I didn't know.
00:10:39 You will you fail the let you.
00:10:42 This is a test that you failed.
00:10:43 You got to watch the lecture again.
00:10:45 Do you? Yeah.
00:10:46 When, when, you know, when Dr.
00:10:48 Vile, when Dr.
00:10:49 Vile, you know, stole zero's body and turned it into Omega
00:10:52 as part of the Alpezo project, Project Alpezo.
00:10:55 I forgot he called it Omega.
00:10:57 Was that? Wait, what was the what was the zero
00:11:00 that was like a empty shell like it was just the body
00:11:05 and the soul was somewhere else?
00:11:07 Yes, that's Omega. That's Omega.
00:11:09 It's it's not it's not empty.
00:11:10 It has like a soul, but it's just evil.
00:11:13 It might be like zero's original personality,
00:11:16 or it might just be like a different entity.
00:11:20 So it's unclear.
00:11:22 OK.
00:11:23 But yeah, that's Omega law instead.
00:11:27 It's it's got to be I feel like it's got to be either
00:11:31 Mega Man 11 or sorry, Mega Man 12 or Mega Man X nine.
00:11:36 Why would Mega Man 12?
00:11:37 It's such a huge budget, though.
00:11:39 Well, it would be an NES style.
00:11:43 Well, it wouldn't because I mean, you know,
00:11:45 Mega Man 11 is not in the NES.
00:11:47 Oh, Mega Man 11 is like.
00:11:50 They they they might have you not see Mega Man 11.
00:11:52 No, it's like it's 3D.
00:11:55 It's kind of got a new it's pretty modern looking.
00:11:59 I assumed all the new classic Mega Man entries were throwbacks.
00:12:03 No, nine and 10 were.
00:12:05 But 11 was they sort of modernized it.
00:12:08 And, you know, if you don't know,
00:12:11 just like I think we said this on the show,
00:12:14 like a month ago, Mega Man 11 became the best selling Mega Man ever
00:12:18 for basically the series entire history.
00:12:20 Mega Man two was the best selling Mega Man ever.
00:12:22 No other entry ever eclipsed it.
00:12:24 And then 11 just did, which is like a huge deal.
00:12:29 So it doesn't it doesn't I mean, from a business perspective,
00:12:31 it's not that shocking if they're like, well, we got to do another one.
00:12:34 And I think it's got to be it's just got to be 12, right?
00:12:37 Like it's got to be 12 or maybe X nine.
00:12:40 Because like, yeah, you know, the market has shown that the demand is there.
00:12:45 Yeah, I wonder because like all the
00:12:47 like not spin-offs, but like new parts of the the franchise,
00:12:51 the X, the zero ZX legends, they're like
00:12:57 they're more lore heavy than the classic one,
00:13:01 which is just sort of a monster of the week kind of, you know,
00:13:04 while he's back at it again, beat him up pretty much.
00:13:07 More like like, you know, Fune would not be needed
00:13:11 for a classic Mega Man.
00:13:13 I mean, as much not that they necessarily need him at all.
00:13:18 But like, yeah, I think they wanted to follow on like the story that he'd written.
00:13:24 Oh, yeah. You know, there were there's making an X game would be difficult
00:13:29 without any input from him.
00:13:32 I mean, I don't know if into creates is still working for Capcom,
00:13:36 but like if they could get if they could get into creates to just do
00:13:41 to do whatever game they're doing next,
00:13:43 I feel like that's that's going to work just fine,
00:13:46 because they made a bunch of really good a bunch of really good Mega Man games.
00:13:52 And yeah, I don't I mean, they made I think they made nine and 10 and 11
00:13:57 without Inafune, I think so.
00:14:02 Yeah, that's it's doable.
00:14:03 That's doable.
00:14:08 Well, I mean, I'm hoping that whenever whatever that big project
00:14:12 is that's being worked on internally, it'd be cool if it comes out
00:14:16 and it would be even cooler if it gives my video a big algorithm boost.
00:14:21 And everyone's like, oh, my God, X nine is here.
00:14:24 I can't believe it.
00:14:25 We can revisit my favorite character, Axel.
00:14:28 Finally, we can return we can return to a trans what we can once again
00:14:32 step into Axel's shoes and a trans our enemies.
00:14:36 Yes, finally, there should be
00:14:40 a new character called Falsetto.
00:14:44 And she's a she's a she's a woman.
00:14:47 Falsetto feels.
00:14:50 That's like a base counterpart base and Falsetto base should come back.
00:14:56 Base I don't know.
00:14:57 Base should come.
00:14:57 Genuinely, base should have been in Mega Man 11.
00:15:00 And I don't know why he wasn't in it.
00:15:02 He wasn't even in deals.
00:15:03 It's actually kind of fucked up that base is nowhere in Mega Man 11.
00:15:07 You get Proto Man, get base, you get Quint, you get zero.
00:15:11 You get everyone who isn't Mega Man likes all of the shadow of the Hedgehog
00:15:15 characters, put them all together in one game.
00:15:18 Oh, and Proto Man and Proto Man was not in 11 either.
00:15:22 This is so fucked up.
00:15:25 This is so fucked up.
00:15:26 What were they thinking?
00:15:28 Games, games, trash, games, trash, trash, trash.
00:15:32 Um, yeah, if I play a Mega Man game, I will probably.
00:15:38 Well, I don't know, would you say I should start with zero because
00:15:41 they're a that's a good, like self-contained series.
00:15:43 That's the impression I got.
00:15:45 They are good.
00:15:46 They're really hard.
00:15:48 They're some of the hardest games in the whole series.
00:15:51 If I'm being if I'm being frank with you.
00:15:55 Dang.
00:15:56 Yeah, I think I think it's generally agreed that those are like.
00:16:02 Some of the some of the classic ones might be equally hard, just basically out
00:16:07 of like poor balancing, the zero games are like hard on purpose.
00:16:14 I'll be I'll be frank.
00:16:15 I used I use save states.
00:16:18 I use quite a bit in my in my revisit of the series because I just didn't want
00:16:24 to replay levels over and over again to get that.
00:16:28 Truly the most valid way to play games that suck if you don't.
00:16:33 Absolutely, absolutely.
00:16:36 Games, I already beat the level.
00:16:38 I beat the level.
00:16:39 Get out of my get off my case.
00:16:40 The the it's so weird.
00:16:43 OK, Mega Man Zero has this scoring system that gives you a rank.
00:16:49 I don't know if we mentioned this in the lecture, but it's really funny.
00:16:52 It has a scoring system that gives you a rank and it gives you a code name
00:16:56 based on a combination of your rank and on like certain metrics.
00:17:00 Like if you kill lots of enemies, it gives you you get one code name.
00:17:04 If you heavily favor one weapon or another weapon, it gives you a different
00:17:07 code name and they can give you some really funny ones like like a wounded
00:17:11 edge boy or or or stuff like that.
00:17:16 But it also like punishes you for like playing the game.
00:17:23 Like if you use cyber elves, it's it's really hard.
00:17:28 It's really hard to like get cyber elves.
00:17:30 You have to feed them crystals and they're very expensive and they don't do that much.
00:17:34 Like they're pretty minor buffs, except for the really expensive ones.
00:17:39 So but if you use cyber elves, it like hurts your rank.
00:17:43 And it's the game just like don't you don't use the mechanic that we've made
00:17:49 gave you to make the game easier.
00:17:51 And in and in zero two, it's really annoying because, OK,
00:17:57 zero two actually has a sort of Mega Man
00:18:01 ask like you gain the enemy's weapon when you kill the the boss.
00:18:06 Like there are a bunch of like alternate attack modes that zero can unlock.
00:18:11 But you only unlock them if you beat the level with an A rank or better,
00:18:16 like an A or S rank.
00:18:19 And your rank is cumulative.
00:18:22 So if you like start out doing bad, like if you get a C rank on the first
00:18:27 on the first level, if you or if you get ranked badly on the first level,
00:18:30 like even if you do better on the next level, because rank is cumulative,
00:18:34 you still won't get the level because it'll average your your ranks out.
00:18:37 And it'll be like, oh, well, you did an A rank on this level,
00:18:40 but because you had C before it averages out to a B.
00:18:43 So sorry, you don't get the enemy weapon.
00:18:45 So you go the whole game with a shitty rank
00:18:48 and you don't get get any of the alternate fire or like special weapons at all.
00:18:52 And the game sucks.
00:18:55 Game is fucking asked and it's dog.
00:18:57 Can you not can you not go back?
00:18:59 Is there no and you can't go back?
00:19:01 No, you can't go back.
00:19:02 You you can return back to the level,
00:19:05 but it doesn't give you like a new like rank because it's not like a mission
00:19:10 because like there's no boss at the end.
00:19:11 It's just you just walk around the level and like find items if you want to.
00:19:15 Oh, so that's the sort of game where like.
00:19:19 Like if you're doing badly, you just die and game over.
00:19:22 I mean, it's perfectly it's perfectly none of the alternate
00:19:26 like fire modes or the alternate attack modes are like game breaking
00:19:30 or like that much better than the regular one.
00:19:33 So it's not like it cripples you and makes the game really hard.
00:19:36 If you don't get them, it's just lame that.
00:19:40 It's just lame that you don't get them unless you meet this
00:19:43 like very specific and somewhat arbitrary thing.
00:19:47 You should just fucking get them for beating the bosses.
00:19:50 I'm sorry.
00:19:54 But it's it's it's perfectly it's perfectly doable to beat the game
00:19:58 without that stuff, but they are they are helpful.
00:20:02 Sometimes. Yeah, see ranking and scores.
00:20:07 I usually I'm like, yeah, whatever, I'm going to get a low score.
00:20:10 I'm going to get a low.
00:20:11 Oh, yeah, because I suck.
00:20:12 No, yeah, but but if I when I was doing when I was doing
00:20:15 actually important, I did not give a shit.
00:20:17 I did not give a shit about the rank, which was fine, except in zero,
00:20:20 two, which for some reason, gates like these fun little things
00:20:25 behind your stupid rank.
00:20:27 You're not allowed to have fun unless you have pain first.
00:20:30 You're not allowed to have fun.
00:20:32 You're not allowed to have fun unless you're a supreme edge man.
00:20:35 No wounded edge boys allowed.
00:20:37 Only supreme edge men can answer the secret clubhouse.
00:20:43 Uh.
00:20:46 And then three is the perfect video game.
00:20:49 And then four is almost as good, except it's really weird
00:20:52 and they give you a stupid special weapon that sucks.
00:20:56 But the game is like, no, it insists that it's good, even though it's bad.
00:21:01 OK, I'm I'm I'm realizing now that like your lecture on the lore of Megman
00:21:06 has almost nothing to do with the enjoyment found in the game.
00:21:10 Although you did talk me into playing legends at some point.
00:21:13 So I will try that.
00:21:15 Oh, you definitely sound fun.
00:21:16 You definitely should. You definitely should play legends.
00:21:20 I did. Yeah, I didn't really. Yeah.
00:21:21 I mean, as the as the title says, yeah, it's about it's lore.
00:21:26 It's lore focused.
00:21:27 Didn't really talk about the mechanics of the game, except to complain
00:21:30 about Axel's a trans and how it doesn't do anything.
00:21:34 There's no point.
00:21:36 There's no freaking point, man.
00:21:39 Does Axel have a little buddy called Grease?
00:21:42 Unfortunately, no.
00:21:44 Also, it's spelled AXL.
00:21:46 It's not spelled AXEL.
00:21:49 Because he's too cool. He's too cool for vowels.
00:21:53 He's actually not the game.
00:21:55 The game doesn't treat him like he's super cool.
00:21:57 The game mostly treats him like he's a a spunky brat.
00:22:02 So, I don't know, whatever.
00:22:05 Well, uh, well, hey, hell, yeah, glad you watched that.
00:22:12 You know, who else watched that?
00:22:16 Hundreds of thousands of people, two hundred and fifty,
00:22:19 a quarter million other people.
00:22:22 It just it just last night, it hit a quarter million
00:22:25 and it has officially it has surpassed
00:22:28 Kokoro Wish and Sonichu 102 and become my third most viewed video
00:22:35 passed after, you know, Sonichu 101 and Tales Get Strolled.
00:22:40 So. Good job.
00:22:43 It's great. It's amazing. Yeah, thank you.
00:22:51 I wonder if it will.
00:22:52 I wonder if it will eventually surpass Tales Get Strolled.
00:22:55 Maybe. Maybe if it gets a big.
00:22:57 It could. I mean, I'll go boost at some point.
00:23:00 I've seen people who are just like excited to see a long video.
00:23:04 So I feel like people would more likely click on an eight hour
00:23:09 big obsessive video game thing.
00:23:11 You know, I was looking at my metrics and I saw,
00:23:15 you know, how it shows you like views per.
00:23:18 You can see that you can see how many views it's gotten per hour
00:23:21 for the last 48 hours. Yeah.
00:23:24 Well, I was looking at that and I noticed that like a lot on several times,
00:23:28 there's like a spike in views around like seven PM, eight PM.
00:23:35 And I and I wonder if that's like, oh, this is these are the people
00:23:38 that like use these videos to go to sleep.
00:23:42 That's great. It might be.
00:23:45 It might be.
00:23:46 I don't have I might have said this already, but I don't get it.
00:23:50 I don't really get I can't I can't use videos of someone talking to go to sleep.
00:23:54 It doesn't work for me.
00:23:55 But people say that they do that.
00:23:57 So, you know, I think that might be those people.
00:24:01 Sometimes when I'm in bed and I've got my phone,
00:24:03 I'll be clicking on YouTube videos, not necessarily looking for something
00:24:06 to make me fall asleep, but I end up being sleepy.
00:24:10 And then I'm like, oh, shit.
00:24:11 I wasn't paying attention to any of the last like minute.
00:24:16 I should turn this off.
00:24:17 And that's how I know when I should go to bed.
00:24:20 But go to sleep, actually, you know, I said in the video,
00:24:24 like leave a comment and I'll try to answer questions.
00:24:28 But there's like so many comments
00:24:32 that I mentioned that like the video's comment ratio is really high.
00:24:35 Like it's it's it's my most common.
00:24:38 It quickly became my it's my second most commented video.
00:24:41 And it's it's it's definitely going to get more comments
00:24:43 eventually than the than the Son of Chew lecture.
00:24:47 Like people just can't stop commenting on this thing,
00:24:51 which is which is probably doing a lot for it algorithmically, which is nice.
00:24:56 So I I've tried to answer like some I've responded to some.
00:25:00 But like.
00:25:02 They just keep coming and they don't stop coming, you know.
00:25:07 Do you have metrics for how long the average
00:25:12 like view like watch time is?
00:25:15 Yeah, where do people leave if they leave?
00:25:18 I assume most people like the majority would stay for the whole thing.
00:25:22 But just in chunks, I think it's actually.
00:25:27 It's actually, I think.
00:25:30 I think people actually like tend to click off it pretty fast.
00:25:32 Like I think I think the I think like I think the watch time drops off
00:25:37 like really fast, like at the beginning, which is a bit.
00:25:41 Sounds bad, but I mean, I think I think it's it's mostly because you you
00:25:46 lead with the talk of lectures and the PCP and hey, guys, well, you know, well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:25:54 Well, look, I'll show I'll show you the graph.
00:25:57 Oh, shit, insider info.
00:26:00 Oh, these are you can post it on screen if you want.
00:26:03 You can we can we can public this private insider info if you want.
00:26:08 It's fine.
00:26:10 Where is it? Here we go.
00:26:12 Yeah, as as you can see, there is a big I mean, every video is like this to some extent.
00:26:20 There is a big drop off right at the very beginning.
00:26:22 You know, it quickly it quickly falls to like 20 percent or so.
00:26:26 And then it actually recovers a little bit.
00:26:28 And I'm pretty sure that's people taking my recommendation and clicking
00:26:32 the like skip ahead to where the actual game discussion starts.
00:26:40 You know.
00:26:42 So there's like a 40 percent drop off of all people.
00:26:47 I did.
00:26:48 So do you know how if those people leave very quickly, if they're counted as views?
00:26:58 Or is that information?
00:26:59 I think they are.
00:27:01 I think they are because I know that views are separate from unique viewers
00:27:06 because I know that the video has around 100,000 unique viewers.
00:27:11 So.
00:27:13 Yeah, I think I think that one account
00:27:17 revisiting the same video multiple times does count as multiple views.
00:27:20 I I think I would imagine so.
00:27:25 Yeah, pretty pretty sure.
00:27:28 Well, let's let me let me show you.
00:27:30 OK, here's the similar metric for the Kokoro wish lecture.
00:27:37 Just to give a side by side comparison.
00:27:42 I know I've definitely done that thing where I'm like scrolling through
00:27:44 videos and like I click on something thinking, yeah, this might be interesting.
00:27:48 And as soon as it's finished loading, I'm like, actually, I don't want to and I leave.
00:27:53 I'm pretty sure that doesn't count as a view because it's like half a second.
00:27:55 But who knows?
00:27:57 I'm I'm looking at that.
00:27:59 OK, the stupid stupid discord is taking a second to process this image.
00:28:04 But looking at the Mega Man graph, I'm not sure what those like big spikes at the end are.
00:28:12 I, well, I'm curious about that as well.
00:28:15 But I did notice there's a bit where it could be that the people's favorite games
00:28:21 they want you to talk about and they click on that time code.
00:28:25 Who would that be?
00:28:26 Yeah, let me because I saw there was a part near the end half
00:28:32 where it's like most rewatched place, you know, the little bumpy line
00:28:39 that sometimes videos have where it's like, oh, this is the place
00:28:42 this is the place that people always click on to go see again.
00:28:47 It was near the end.
00:28:47 It could be the similar place six.
00:28:51 Let's see. The first bike is at 603.
00:28:55 Thirty one. OK.
00:28:58 So that's a little that's that first spike is around.
00:29:03 Or just or slightly after.
00:29:06 Mega Man zero fourth.
00:29:08 It's in the Mega Man zero four section. OK.
00:29:14 And then the second big spike is at 63311.
00:29:19 And that is at what am I talking about then?
00:29:22 Six thirty three.
00:29:23 That's just before I start talking about Mega Man X seven.
00:29:28 But it's not at the exact like time codes.
00:29:30 It's not the exact time when like you can click the little chapter starter
00:29:34 and it starts the chapter there.
00:29:36 So I'm not really sure.
00:29:40 Maybe they manually click on the time code area.
00:29:45 Like on the bar, an average, an average of people clicking around
00:29:48 the also spike.
00:29:50 Also, I have not looked at the.
00:29:53 Oh, my God.
00:29:54 Yeah, the the view like the viewer retention graph on the timeline is like,
00:30:00 yeah, it's big spikes like like huge spikes comparatively around.
00:30:07 Yeah, the trend, the end of Mega Man zero four and the start of Mega Man X seven.
00:30:14 OK. Or no, no, no, they love that they love it.
00:30:16 They want it, whatever it is.
00:30:18 It's no, it's it's X eight.
00:30:20 It's the start of X eight.
00:30:22 Why? It's not even at the very.
00:30:24 It's just kind of like towards the beginning slash middle part of X eight.
00:30:31 That's that's the the the money zone.
00:30:33 That's the the hotspot.
00:30:34 You know what they you know what the people want now.
00:30:36 It's the part where I'm talking about like rockets and the and the the orbital elevator.
00:30:42 Huh.
00:30:45 Weird, crazy.
00:30:48 Crazy.
00:30:51 Anyway, anyway, to the graph, yeah.
00:30:55 Like, look at this, the Kokura wish, like the Mega Man lecture.
00:30:59 OK, now on the one hand, like the numbers are stretched out.
00:31:03 So it might be a bit deceptive and you might it might be like.
00:31:07 OK, like, yeah, they both kind of drop off really quick at the beginning,
00:31:10 but the the the Mega Man drops off much faster.
00:31:15 But actually, it's like kind of eight times slower than that
00:31:18 because the video is so much longer.
00:31:20 But yeah, the Kokura wish like quickly drops to about 33 percent.
00:31:25 And then there's that little kind of dip around the halfway mark.
00:31:28 And you know what that is?
00:31:30 What? That's the the part where I show the the little video,
00:31:35 like the game that she made, the little two zero and adventure game with the music.
00:31:41 How people skip through that?
00:31:42 I think I think people skip through that.
00:31:45 What was it called?
00:31:45 I'm pretty Halcyon.
00:31:50 Halcyon days. No, no.
00:31:53 What was wrong?
00:31:55 The pink girl, fuck, I'm blanking on what the pink girl's name is.
00:31:59 You know, the one spinel. No.
00:32:03 But she's got that name that means purple.
00:32:08 J.D.R. Pink Girl YouTube.
00:32:14 Help me. No, I mean, Google, help me.
00:32:16 Simply go to your own video.
00:32:18 No, I don't.
00:32:19 How?
00:32:22 No, what's the name?
00:32:23 I don't want.
00:32:26 All right, to give up.
00:32:27 Got to watch your own lecture.
00:32:29 I can't give the covid brain, the covid brain fog has come back.
00:32:34 No, this is the Mega Man thing.
00:32:37 You've you've filled it with Mega Man knowledge now.
00:32:39 Some other knowledge is gone.
00:32:41 Heliotrope, pastel defender heliotrope.
00:32:44 That's the one. Oh, you.
00:32:48 I know the name. I just haven't met the man.
00:32:51 Well, you were.
00:32:55 Yeah, you did.
00:32:57 Maybe you haven't rewatched that video because you were there.
00:33:00 And I haven't rewatched the video.
00:33:01 It's been a long time.
00:33:02 It's the pink hair.
00:33:03 With the comic either.
00:33:04 This the superhero girl.
00:33:06 That's like the puppet that the guy put the the glowing orb in.
00:33:10 Oh, yeah, the sex doll that became his daughter.
00:33:17 Based anyway.
00:33:19 Yeah, that's the there's there's a musical when it's not musical,
00:33:22 but there's a part where I play a like video sort of like
00:33:26 video game bit in the middle to show it off.
00:33:28 And yeah, people click through that.
00:33:30 And then, yeah, versus on this one,
00:33:33 it like immediately drops to like 20 percent or even down to 15 percent.
00:33:38 And then it recovers up to like 30 ish.
00:33:40 What's that first little spike in the Mega Man?
00:33:44 Oh, you mean not the one at the very beginning,
00:33:48 but like kind of a third in? Yeah, yeah.
00:33:51 And is that where you start talking about X or something?
00:33:55 Yeah, analytics tab.
00:33:57 That's at two hours and twenty two minutes.
00:34:03 So that is.
00:34:07 No, that's some that's in between when I'm talking about Mega Man X
00:34:12 and Mega Man to the power fighters.
00:34:16 No, sorry, Mega Man seven.
00:34:19 But between Mega Man seven and Mega Man to the power fighters.
00:34:22 Yeah, I don't know why there's a spike there.
00:34:26 It's very strange.
00:34:28 Oh, speaking of why, it's not really much to say,
00:34:31 but like Mega Man knowledge has made me like, oh,
00:34:35 I remember when Game Grumps played Mega Man seven,
00:34:38 that was like the first game they played and I go back.
00:34:42 And it's like, oh, I remember this. This was good.
00:34:44 Why is this not a thing anymore? Dang it.
00:34:47 Mega Man's happening and they're just chilling out and joking.
00:34:51 Were they playing Mega Man seven, you said? Was that the one?
00:34:53 Yeah, it's like got the guy with the big chin robot.
00:34:58 Guts, man, all thing.
00:35:00 Not Guts, man, the the guy who sells stuff.
00:35:03 Oh, auto. Yeah, I recognize him in the lecture
00:35:07 when you play to demand. It's like, wait, I know that guy.
00:35:09 That's from Game Grumps.
00:35:10 That's the guy in the Game Grumps play through.
00:35:13 There's, oh, you know, it's like,
00:35:18 oh, Protoman told you to burn the trees in the forest.
00:35:20 And there was that whole bit.
00:35:22 They did seven asses is from that game.
00:35:24 Do you remember seven asses?
00:35:25 Do you ever watch?
00:35:26 Wait, you watch Game Grumps at the time?
00:35:28 I I've definitely heard seven asses before.
00:35:32 Yeah, it was it was a moment in the Mega Man seven that I didn't
00:35:37 realize at the time, but I'd since realized that
00:35:40 like John was playing and Aaron was looking up
00:35:45 which tree to burn to get a specific item.
00:35:48 Yes.
00:35:48 But they didn't want to say they were like looking at a walkthrough.
00:35:52 So John said, how much ass do you think Mega Man gets?
00:35:57 And Aaron says seven.
00:35:59 Two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven asses.
00:36:06 And it's the seventh tree, I guess.
00:36:09 I might have watched that video because I definitely remember that
00:36:13 or I might have seen it in a clip compilation or something.
00:36:15 But OK, the thing about auto and I'm hazyly remembering this,
00:36:19 I might get some details wrong.
00:36:20 But I think it's in Mega Man.
00:36:22 I think it's it might be in the one with cutscenes or it might be in.
00:36:27 No, it's in it's I think it's in one of the X games.
00:36:31 It might be an X for there's like an anime cutscene
00:36:35 and you can see auto in one of the cutscenes.
00:36:39 And it's and it's like auto is like cannon in in X.
00:36:45 But only in a cutscene and it's and it's like an Easter egg.
00:36:48 But he's there.
00:36:51 And it's a little wacky.
00:36:53 Hang on.
00:36:54 More like auto erotic
00:36:55 asphyxiation, am I right?
00:36:57 Yes, yes, yes.
00:37:00 That's right.
00:37:01 That's right.
00:37:02 Very good.
00:37:04 He just chokes you.
00:37:08 He just chokes you.
00:37:09 And that's what that's that's how that's the game.
00:37:15 Oh, no, no, no, he has.
00:37:18 Auto has a small cameo in Volt Catfish's introduction scene
00:37:22 in the PlayStation Sega Saturn PC and Mega Man X collection versions of Mega Man X3.
00:37:30 Oh, it's in like a re-release.
00:37:33 It's in like an additional cut an additional cutscene
00:37:36 attitude to a re-release of X3.
00:37:39 He's like he's like sitting in the background.
00:37:42 He's like sitting in like a in like a Japanese style house,
00:37:44 like sitting on the tatami mats, watching TV or something.
00:37:48 And then Volt Catfish like swoops out in front and goes like,
00:37:53 die, Volt Catfish, die.
00:37:57 OK, that's debatably canon.
00:38:03 The fact that it's a remake makes me mistrustful.
00:38:09 Remake, more like P make.
00:38:12 I I urinate on this game.
00:38:15 I love when my video gets views and I love money and power.
00:38:22 I love clout.
00:38:25 This is just what Dr. Wiley would say.
00:38:27 Yeah, well.
00:38:32 What of it?
00:38:33 Maybe he had some maybe he would maybe he had some points after all.
00:38:38 But what would you say would say?
00:38:39 I love Dr. Wiley.
00:38:42 There's some things I love about Dr. Wiley.
00:38:46 He made some good points.
00:38:48 You know, he was just looking out for his for his robots.
00:38:51 You know, he made some mistakes, but haven't we all?
00:38:53 You know, I'm just thinking of like of like a YouTube version of Mega Man,
00:39:03 where like Dr. Light is a YouTuber and Dr. Wiley re re uploads the video,
00:39:09 but he changes it, changes it to make it evil.
00:39:13 I'm thinking about I'm thinking about a future because like we're getting on
00:39:17 towards 20 X DX already.
00:39:18 I'm thinking about a future where like Dr.
00:39:21 Light and Dr. Wiley are like guests on the Joe Rogan podcast,
00:39:25 like arguing about like whether I don't know,
00:39:28 like whether the double gear system is like the future of robotics or something.
00:39:34 You're thinking of using two gears.
00:39:36 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
00:39:37 What we don't like is like, you know, the the human, you know, a police human,
00:39:43 the robot police, the robots, the police are using now are too dangerous.
00:39:47 They they kill indiscriminately.
00:39:49 You know, we've got to we've got to build robots that can that can make
00:39:52 moral judgment.
00:39:52 We've got to advance AI to the point that they can they have human intelligence.
00:39:56 They can make moral judgment or something.
00:39:57 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Dr. Wiley, let me go back to you.
00:40:00 Let me go back to where you were saying you.
00:40:02 You're saying you want to add a second gear.
00:40:04 You're talking. You're saying you had two gears, though.
00:40:07 That blows my mind that I've seen one gear.
00:40:12 One gear I've seen before this little this little what do you call
00:40:18 the the Boston Dynamics dog?
00:40:20 There's a really I know that was a really weak Joe Rogan impression.
00:40:23 I'm sorry. I'm not that familiar with the man's work.
00:40:28 He just sort of is a big guy.
00:40:29 And he mumbles, isn't that the truth?
00:40:31 I yeah, there's not really like anything that distinct about the way he talks.
00:40:37 It's it's mostly his mic quality.
00:40:39 It's like the radio voice, like the the ASMR deep guy.
00:40:43 And he's just sort of like, wow, wow.
00:40:44 Yeah.
00:40:45 Oh, this is it.
00:40:47 Yeah, that's really that's really important.
00:40:52 That sounds like it sounds like your team is doing really important work.
00:40:54 Hey, you guys ever try DMZ?
00:40:57 You got you guys ever take mushrooms?
00:40:59 I don't know. That's my best.
00:41:01 That's my best. That's my best impression.
00:41:06 Dr. Light would make the little Boston Dynamics robot to like,
00:41:10 oh, it's stack books on shelves.
00:41:14 Isn't he a good boy?
00:41:15 Isn't he a good dog?
00:41:16 Mm hmm. Yeah, pretty good dog.
00:41:20 And then Dr.
00:41:20 Wiley would make it pee on and take a shit all over the floor.
00:41:26 I've added we've added poop and pee technology
00:41:30 to bring to bring humans and robots closer to get closer than ever.
00:41:34 Uh, Dr.
00:41:39 Master Thomas at the end of Mega Man ZX
00:41:43 ZX Advent, hmm, Master Mikhail, you know, we've since the equality laws,
00:41:49 humans and robots, you know, we for equality, humans no longer poop and pee.
00:41:53 But what do you think we did with all that poop and pee, huh?
00:41:56 What do you think?
00:41:57 Do you think we just knew we were going to use it for something?
00:42:00 We're going to use all that poop and pee.
00:42:02 It didn't just go away.
00:42:03 We saved it. We saved it.
00:42:05 It's the future, Master Mikhail.
00:42:07 Oh, no, what do you think we did with all the poop and pee?
00:42:13 We've condensed it into a new material that we can use to make new robots.
00:42:19 Robots made of poop and pee.
00:42:21 We call them.
00:42:22 We call we would use to build who build Elysium.
00:42:26 This is the future.
00:42:28 Uh, uh.
00:42:31 Diarrhea.
00:42:32 Lol. OK.
00:42:35 Hey, Lois. Diarrhea.
00:42:38 Hey, Wiley. What? Diarrhea.
00:42:47 Mega Man has infinite possibilities.
00:42:51 And this is what we choose.
00:42:52 That's why his name is X. That's why his name is X.
00:42:55 He doesn't have a code number.
00:42:57 He doesn't have a Wiley number.
00:43:00 He has the variable X because he can be anything.
00:43:02 Give. Do you understand?
00:43:05 Do you understand?
00:43:07 Could there not be a Mega Man Y?
00:43:11 I.
00:43:13 I guess, you know, there's a there's a in like the toy line.
00:43:20 There is a, you know, you know how in Kingdom Hearts, right?
00:43:24 There's there's there's key like the key blade.
00:43:29 Some key blade.
00:43:30 Some some say Kai, but the meaning is the same.
00:43:33 Yeah.
00:43:35 And, you know, well, there's there's a there's like a dark evil X called
00:43:40 called Kai. Mega Man Ki.
00:43:43 Yeah, I think.
00:43:45 Yeah, some say key, but the meaning is the same.
00:43:49 Mega Man Eeks.
00:43:50 What's his? He has a slightly more long name than that.
00:43:56 Magnificent man.
00:43:57 He's like a dark copy of X and he's like gold and black.
00:44:04 Metal X.
00:44:09 Wait a minute. OK, there's also.
00:44:11 Oh, God, fucking damn it.
00:44:12 In the cards in in like the in the Mega Man in the Rockman X Mega Mission
00:44:18 like card series, there's one called how the fuck do you pronounce this?
00:44:24 OK, all right.
00:44:26 So X, his name in Japanese is pronounced X, right?
00:44:31 Like it's just the Japaneseization of the pronunciation of the letters X.
00:44:37 Well, this guy is called what the fuck?
00:44:41 This guy is called Iksu and it's spelled like this.
00:44:48 It's spelled like this.
00:44:50 It's spelled like this.
00:44:53 Eeks.
00:44:54 So this guy is from the card and he's an evil doppelganger of X,
00:45:00 right? And then there's OK.
00:45:03 Well, I you could read that as nine because of the Roman numeral.
00:45:09 I think that would be going against the wishes of the of the Greek.
00:45:14 And then there's this guy who is from the toy series.
00:45:17 And this guy, OK, in spite of the way his name is spelled,
00:45:20 his name is just pronounced Kai.
00:45:22 It's not pronounced X, Kai or key, Kai.
00:45:25 It's just Kai.
00:45:26 But you spell it like that as though you're meant to say it twice.
00:45:31 Kai, Kai.
00:45:32 And this guy is he's not a doppelganger.
00:45:35 He's a prototype copy.
00:45:38 He's a prototype copy of the original game.
00:45:41 So he maybe he's related to copy X.
00:45:45 From the other more fucking Mega Man
00:45:50 and then there are Pokemon like so many of these guys.
00:45:54 No, there's not a thousand.
00:45:56 There's not a thousand different Mavericks or Reploids.
00:46:01 I'm going to have to say probably not.
00:46:04 I mean, I guess there are lots of like generic background.
00:46:08 Reploids.
00:46:09 So like all of the ones, all of the ones in the lecture
00:46:13 is just the ones in the video games.
00:46:15 But then there's the I guess a card game and like the comics.
00:46:19 And yeah, most of those are most of those are repeats, though.
00:46:24 Most characters and Mavericks like reoccur in the different,
00:46:29 you know, cards and games and stuff.
00:46:31 Each each each version has like a few new
00:46:34 dudes, a few new a few new dudes.
00:46:40 And I guess they're all I guess they were all the sub bosses.
00:46:42 Like, you know, there's like the the block Golem.
00:46:46 I wonder if you added up like all the different.
00:46:50 I mean, if you added up all the different enemies,
00:46:53 there probably are more robots in Mega Man than there are Pokemon
00:46:59 because each Pokemon is like a little bit more robustly fleshed out
00:47:03 than a rank and file enemy in the Mega Man series.
00:47:07 Like a little propeller with eyes from Mega Man.
00:47:10 Yeah, two or just a little met.
00:47:13 You know what a met is?
00:47:15 I don't even a metropolitan.
00:47:18 I don't even mention Mets.
00:47:19 Mets, Mets are the little guys in the classic Mega Man,
00:47:21 the little like black guys under the hard hat.
00:47:25 Oh, the little yeah, I like those guys.
00:47:28 Yeah, and they come in different like varieties sometimes.
00:47:31 They're just they're just little Mega Man goombas.
00:47:34 They're sometimes called Metals or Metars or Mets.
00:47:40 I think I think in English, they're usually just called Mets is what we've settled on.
00:47:44 And they're even in zero because there are cyber elves
00:47:48 that can transform regular enemies into Mets.
00:47:52 Just just because, just as a little cameo.
00:47:55 Hey, damn, there's so many things.
00:47:58 So many things to say.
00:48:00 Twitch was talking to Twitch a little bit in the server in the guest server.
00:48:05 And he said like, you know, he could just he could go on all day about Mega Man.
00:48:08 And like, there really is like there really is just no end of like facts
00:48:12 you could bring up and be like, did you know that in this one game,
00:48:17 some fucked up shit happens?
00:48:19 And you say, yes, of course, every game is like that.
00:48:23 I just I just assumed it is pretty cool.
00:48:28 Like just just the sheer quantity of little stories and characters and stuff.
00:48:35 Yeah, I like I like a really robust universe.
00:48:40 Yeah, it is pretty robust.
00:48:42 It's it's pretty robust and.
00:48:46 But it's just it's just it's it's it's a little annoying that like
00:48:51 I get I'm getting a lot of comments that are sort of specifically doing
00:48:55 the thing that I like didn't do, which is being like, oh, well, actually,
00:49:01 you know, this is the like X is the explanation for something in the games.
00:49:06 And it'll be like some fact that's like from the the manga or from like a cartoon
00:49:11 or from like a book or something.
00:49:13 And I'm like, kind of I kind of tried.
00:49:16 I mean, the mangas are specifically the mangas and the cartoons are specifically
00:49:20 an alternate canon.
00:49:21 The books, generally, I would say, probably are like legitimate canon.
00:49:27 Although they are mostly like.
00:49:30 Kind of after the fact is sort of a lot of it is retcon stuff, which is fine.
00:49:37 But like manga stuff is like doesn't it basically doesn't
00:49:40 count unless it's like something that's very strongly hinted at in the game.
00:49:44 And it's like reasonable to be like, this is probably what the game was trying to say.
00:49:48 And even then you kind of have to you kind of have to debate it.
00:49:52 I got a pee quick.
00:49:54 OK, back. OK.
00:49:58 I'm back.
00:49:59 Wahoo. Wow, we've been going for almost an hour.
00:50:02 Wow, that flew by.
00:50:05 I want to talk a little bit about something I mentioned last time briefly.
00:50:12 Yeah, the idea of going hibernating because it's cold and I just want to sleep.
00:50:19 I tried it out.
00:50:21 Well, I didn't really try it out.
00:50:22 It was just sort of.
00:50:24 Well, it the the idea is.
00:50:28 I'm done with like friendship ended with toil.
00:50:32 Now sleep is my best friend.
00:50:34 I just want to sleep for the whole rest of the year.
00:50:37 Makes sense.
00:50:38 I've realized that it's a little.
00:50:41 Like difficult to feel good at the same time.
00:50:44 Like it's nice to indulge a bit,
00:50:46 but like I feel bad that I'm not doing the things I did.
00:50:50 Got all this Clarissa stuff to still do.
00:50:52 Yeah.
00:50:53 So I'm going to I'm going to change my approach.
00:50:57 Hibernation nation is still happening,
00:51:00 but it's it's not so much that I'm going to stay in bed,
00:51:03 but I'm going to turn everything into a bed.
00:51:07 I'm going to extremely comfort my lived experience.
00:51:12 I'm going to wear blankets everywhere.
00:51:13 I'm going to I'm going to move my bed
00:51:15 and I'm going to get all my plushies and blankets and pillows
00:51:18 and put a big old like crash pile in the middle of the floor.
00:51:22 I'm just that's I feel like I need that.
00:51:24 I need to be able to just crawl into that
00:51:27 and then crawl out of it without too much trouble.
00:51:32 And it's different from going to sleep
00:51:35 because you can't really sleep on that, but it's nice and comfy.
00:51:38 I'm going to try and make it comfy
00:51:40 like the default state while I can do work at the computer and elsewhere.
00:51:48 I I think it's a worthy endeavor and I wish you great great success in it.
00:51:54 Yeah, it's just so cold.
00:51:58 You wake up and it's you don't yet.
00:52:00 How do you consider getting?
00:52:02 Have you considered getting a space heater?
00:52:06 Space is too big.
00:52:08 Just get a little space here, put it in your room.
00:52:10 That's what I do.
00:52:11 My room is I mean, sometimes it gets a little chilly.
00:52:16 I mean, all I really need is a blanket and I'm fine.
00:52:20 It's there's something to be said for a blanket
00:52:23 that's cozier than just a heater.
00:52:28 Yeah. I don't know.
00:52:30 I feel like it depends on the degree of chilliness we're talking about here.
00:52:34 I feel like it's it's like.
00:52:39 My my my wishes are to feel comfy all the time,
00:52:43 but I will only feel happy if I'm also getting some stuff done.
00:52:47 So I just need to be comfy while I'm working
00:52:50 and making my room more comfy is a good way to do that.
00:52:55 All right.
00:52:59 I understand.
00:53:00 Wait, I had to bite off my pinky fingernail.
00:53:05 You understand?
00:53:07 No, I do not.
00:53:08 Oh, well, sometimes you just got to do it.
00:53:12 I looked at my nails and they're they're fucked up.
00:53:14 But why it's not it's nothing.
00:53:17 It's it's a head nail polish on.
00:53:19 But they're starting to chip.
00:53:21 And so it looks like my nails are like cracked, but they're they're all right.
00:53:27 I got a call.
00:53:29 I could go to the dentist.
00:53:31 I've been saying for years now that I need to go to the dentist.
00:53:37 You know what I decided?
00:53:39 You know what I decided I'm going to do?
00:53:40 I had a genius idea.
00:53:42 One of the reasons I've been putting off going to the dentist
00:53:44 because I was like, I don't know how to sort out insurance
00:53:47 because like I don't have a like big boy real job.
00:53:49 So I don't have like employer provided dental insurance.
00:53:53 So I'm like, well, should I get some kind of private insurance?
00:53:57 And I looked into it and every private insurance company seems like they don't do shit.
00:54:01 They seem like garbage.
00:54:02 And I'm like, OK, well, I don't know what to do then.
00:54:06 But I realized, you know, I can probably just do.
00:54:09 I could probably just call the dentist and ask them
00:54:14 what insurance should I get that will cover, you know, routine procedures
00:54:18 like cleaning and maybe like cavity filling because they.
00:54:24 We're on the same team.
00:54:25 We both want the same thing.
00:54:26 We want an insurance company to give them money.
00:54:29 I could probably just call them and they'll just tell me, oh, yeah, get this,
00:54:33 get this, it'll cover all that stuff.
00:54:35 Have you done that yet? Have you done that yet?
00:54:37 Not yet. But it was just a couple of days ago.
00:54:39 I was like, I could just ask them.
00:54:41 I haven't done it yet, but I'm going to do that.
00:54:44 I hope that works because that that should be an easy way to do it.
00:54:47 I feel like I feel like it's I've I've arrived at a reasonable conclusion.
00:54:54 I feel like they'll want to help me with that so that I can pay them.
00:55:01 My teeth look like shit.
00:55:02 My teeth look terrible. I hate them.
00:55:03 They're like so dingy or too yet they're yellow.
00:55:07 In my they're yellow than they used to be.
00:55:10 And I hope to get some pain.
00:55:12 I hope that if I get them clean, they will look better.
00:55:14 I hope that if I get them clean, they will look better
00:55:17 like I remember them looking and not all dingy and crappy.
00:55:20 I hope it's a temporary state of affairs.
00:55:23 But I'm actually scared.
00:55:24 I'm actually scared they'll go to the dentist and they'll clean my teeth
00:55:27 and I'll look at them and I'll be like, oh, they still look bad.
00:55:30 My life is over.
00:55:32 So I should just not go to the dentist to avoid that.
00:55:35 Yeah, avoid all possible bad things.
00:55:39 Never leave your house, never do anything.
00:55:41 Yeah, foolproof, can't fail.
00:55:46 I think I mentioned in the PCP chat.
00:55:49 That I had a I had a battle of wills with my old landlord this week.
00:55:55 Oh, yeah. Yeah, you said something about that.
00:55:59 Yeah.
00:56:00 Can I can I give you the quick version of what's gone on with that?
00:56:04 Yeah. OK, it's it's.
00:56:07 Uh, I knew this lady was not trustworthy.
00:56:11 Everyone else that lived in the building that I talked to said,
00:56:14 you're not going to your deposit back.
00:56:15 She's going to try and like scam you out of your deposit.
00:56:17 She's going to make up some fake shit.
00:56:19 You're not going to get your deposit back.
00:56:20 And I'm like, well, well, that sucks.
00:56:23 So I deliberately did not pay my last two months of rent.
00:56:28 Oh, three months, actually.
00:56:29 Well, because, I mean, I had already paid last month when I moved in
00:56:33 and she had a security deposit.
00:56:34 So I was two months behind on rent, but she had the deposit.
00:56:38 So it was really only one month behind, sort of.
00:56:41 So that was a couple of months ago I moved out and.
00:56:46 Kind of just to be a dick.
00:56:49 I knew that I was two months delinquent on rent,
00:56:51 but I kept texting her and being like, no, I didn't do it a bunch.
00:56:54 I did a couple of times I texted her, like, where's my deposit?
00:56:57 No, you're going to give me back my deposit.
00:57:00 And then this week she messages me back to be like.
00:57:05 There was some shoes.
00:57:06 I was going to send me a bill or so she was like, I'll send you.
00:57:08 I'll send you a statement.
00:57:09 I'll send you a statement.
00:57:11 And I think she had my zip code wrong or something.
00:57:14 So like, I didn't get the statement so that we had to figure that out.
00:57:17 But anyway, uh, cutting to the chase, she says, like, you're behind on rent.
00:57:22 You owe me a lot of money.
00:57:24 And then she sends me a bill for.
00:57:27 Like more than two months, two months rent.
00:57:30 She sends me a bill for like $1,600.
00:57:33 And it's like, you owe me two months rent.
00:57:37 No, mine, two months rent minus the deposit.
00:57:41 So she did include the fact that she has my deposit and that went towards rent.
00:57:45 So that was good.
00:57:46 But then she also included like, like a hundred and something dollars for a
00:57:50 cleaning bill, um, something else, $250 for damages to the window, which means,
00:57:59 okay, when I moved in, there were like some metal bars across the window and I
00:58:03 couldn't put an AC unit in.
00:58:04 So I asked this, I literally asked the like super or whatever, the supervisor,
00:58:10 I asked him, can you get these bars off?
00:58:12 And he was like, sure.
00:58:13 And he took the bars off so I could put my AC unit in.
00:58:16 So I didn't even do that.
00:58:17 The fucking property manager did that.
00:58:19 So that's outrageous.
00:58:21 And then the final straw was like, I think it was like $500.
00:58:26 She wanted like $500 in late fees for the payment being late.
00:58:32 And yeah.
00:58:35 And that's like, that's, that's most of a month's rent.
00:58:37 And here's the thing.
00:58:39 I have, I have read the law.
00:58:41 I have read Massachusetts tenant law in Massachusetts.
00:58:44 Landlords can charge a late fee and it is not technically capped how much they can
00:58:50 charge, but they cannot charge a late fee until rent is more than a month late,
00:58:57 which to be fair, this latest month is one, one month's rent is, but she was
00:59:06 charging for two months because she was including both of the months that I didn't
00:59:11 pay, but one of those was covered by the deposit.
00:59:14 So it really doesn't make any sense to charge a late fee for that month.
00:59:17 And then on the other one, okay, the lease stipulates that there will be a late
00:59:24 fee after a week, which is illegal.
00:59:27 That's not what the law says you're allowed to do.
00:59:29 And then it says there will be an additional late fee after a month and
00:59:32 the after a month late fee that it stipulates is $250, which is outrageously high.
00:59:38 But even that outrageously high amount is for the entire house.
00:59:42 Like it's for everybody living in the house, not just for me.
00:59:45 One guy, one of five guys living in one room.
00:59:48 So the fact that she tried to charge me that amount like twice for two, for
00:59:52 two different months is like completely ridiculous.
00:59:56 So I have to do this.
00:59:58 So basically I go into attack mode, right?
01:00:01 I go into like rabid dog, you know, backed into a corner, you know, a mode.
01:00:06 And I, and I'm just, and I just get, and I just like lawyer up.
01:00:09 I'm like, I'm going to call lawyers.
01:00:10 Like I'm going to take you to court over this.
01:00:12 Like we're going to, we're like, fuck you.
01:00:16 And she's like, I'll sue you for this.
01:00:18 I'll, I'll sue you if you don't pay.
01:00:19 What do you mean you're not going to pay?
01:00:21 You're a bad person.
01:00:23 I'm going to sue you for discriminating against me for being Indian.
01:00:25 She said that she said you're discriminating against me for being Indian.
01:00:30 There's a long text thing and she got really defensive.
01:00:35 I know, I know in my heart.
01:00:38 And I told this to her, you don't want me to go to, you don't
01:00:42 want to take me to court because your lease is illegal.
01:00:45 You've broken the law a bunch of times.
01:00:46 You, I have, I have text messages of you requesting late fees when they are not legal.
01:00:52 I have text messages of me requesting you to give me a copy of the lease.
01:00:56 And you did not give it to me.
01:00:58 You refuse to give it to me, even though I asked you for it.
01:01:00 That's illegal, you know, you will, you do not, you do not want to go through
01:01:04 what you will go through if this goes to court.
01:01:07 I probably could just simply pay her nothing.
01:01:11 I probably could just not give her anything and there would be nothing she
01:01:14 would be willing to do about it.
01:01:15 And I told her that and she got really mad.
01:01:18 She said, I'm disrespectful, said I'm discriminating against her for being Indian.
01:01:22 And I, and I said, no, I didn't even respond to that because it doesn't
01:01:25 even merit a response.
01:01:27 But anyway, the long story short of it, the ultimate conclusion is that,
01:01:33 yeah, I bullied her into, I'll pay the rent that I owe minus the deposit,
01:01:40 which she already has.
01:01:42 And I, and I even agree, I'll pay the $100 cleaning fee and like another
01:01:49 like $100 late fee or something.
01:01:52 So I expected not to get my deposit back at all, but in the end, I am getting
01:01:57 it mostly back minus like $200 for the clean, the cleaning fee is honestly
01:02:03 kind of fair because yeah, the place was kind of a dump when we all moved out.
01:02:06 So I'm not even mad about that one.
01:02:08 Uh, the late fees, the late fees, a little bullshit, but like whatever.
01:02:14 I talked to her down from $1,600 to like $900.
01:02:17 So like, I don't care.
01:02:20 Uh, so that's what happened.
01:02:22 This woman is a demon.
01:02:23 She's a vampire.
01:02:25 Uh, I might, I just, after I send her the bill, I might take my, like the, I might
01:02:31 try to like report her to some bureau or something because she's definitely
01:02:35 like a scammer slumlord who is like breaking the law.
01:02:38 And she definitely does this to all her tenants.
01:02:40 She definitely bullies them all into giving her ridiculous late fees.
01:02:43 And I'm sure most of them do not have the financial security that I have, that
01:02:48 they can like play this stupid game of chicken that like if they lose, they,
01:02:52 they might go to court and they might, you know, have to, she said like, oh,
01:02:56 I'll sue you for double, you know, I'll see you and the courts will make you
01:02:59 pay me $3,000.
01:03:00 They'll make you pay me double in the end.
01:03:01 Don't, don't do this.
01:03:02 And I was like, no, you're lying.
01:03:04 I know that won't happen.
01:03:07 Die.
01:03:08 Wow.
01:03:10 That sounds, I mean, I'd, I'd be fucking scared.
01:03:13 I, I mean, it was, it, it, it was, it was, I was a little scared because like,
01:03:18 what if she, like, I, I know that she won't actually take me to court.
01:03:23 I'm confident she doesn't actually want to do that.
01:03:25 But I was afraid that she might take the bill and send it to a collections
01:03:30 agency and I was afraid of that because if it went to a collections agency,
01:03:35 then it might be report, even whether it's like, I didn't think the bill is
01:03:39 legitimate, but like, I was wondering, like, even though the bill is legitimate
01:03:43 and all these fees are just made up, can she just send that number off to a,
01:03:46 a, a collections agency and have them like, and then they report it to a
01:03:51 credit bureau and then my credit takes, that's like the worst thing that can
01:03:55 happen to your credit score.
01:03:57 And I have an immaculate credit score and I would be so mad.
01:04:00 If like, I lost my incredible credit score because this, because this
01:04:05 devil just made up a bunch of fake fees and told a credit bureau that I owe,
01:04:10 that I owe her that money and they just believed her.
01:04:13 That would make me so mad.
01:04:14 So that's what I was really upset, really scared about was that happening.
01:04:18 I knew that I would win in court because I had like, I had records of her
01:04:22 like breaking the law and stuff, violating like 10, 10 agreements.
01:04:27 So I wasn't that scared about that.
01:04:28 I was afraid that she would try to go through with it, even, even like,
01:04:32 without knowing that she would definitely lose.
01:04:35 But in doing so would like, would like harm me on her way down, basically.
01:04:41 Yeah, you don't want to ever try to get justice because you'll go broke.
01:04:46 You'll get banged out.
01:04:47 I'm sure, and I'm sure that when she does this most of the time, people
01:04:51 do not want to risk that.
01:04:53 And they're just like, yeah, because, because the other guy that lived there,
01:04:58 he like, he just didn't get his deposit back.
01:05:00 Like he, he, he moved out and she just kept his deposit.
01:05:04 And I'm sure she said like, oh, yeah, late fees.
01:05:06 Oh, yeah, cleaning fees.
01:05:08 Oh, yeah, there was damage to the room.
01:05:10 Yeah, we are there.
01:05:10 I'm keeping your, I got to keep your deposit.
01:05:13 And like, she's just a thief.
01:05:16 She's just a thief and a criminal and she should be in prison, in my opinion.
01:05:20 Um, I don't know.
01:05:23 It's almost like you may as well trash the place.
01:05:27 You may as well, you may as well do as many, break as many rules as you want
01:05:31 because it's not going to make a difference.
01:05:34 Yeah, definitely, definitely.
01:05:37 Good.
01:05:38 I think that happened to me.
01:05:40 I mean, when I was at uni or as in a shared house, but nobody was really
01:05:47 willing to do like the, the bins.
01:05:50 And I was, we were all lazy, I guess, but like the bins did pile up.
01:05:54 There was rubbish everywhere.
01:05:56 So I understand that he took my deposit.
01:05:59 Um, but he also was a scary old man.
01:06:02 And I don't think he liked me or anyone.
01:06:04 I didn't think he liked human beings because it was, it was a university area.
01:06:10 So like, he's probably tired of those darned kids.
01:06:13 And he had a point because we didn't clean up anything.
01:06:16 Who wouldn't be tired of those darned kids?
01:06:18 Yeah.
01:06:19 Um, my, there's a, there's a, there's a fucking situation in my house right now
01:06:27 is that there's no toilet paper anywhere.
01:06:29 And like, I bought a huge box, like a huge case of toilet paper.
01:06:34 I bought like, you know, 20, like 24 or 36 rolls or something a while ago.
01:06:41 I just bought it and I let everyone use it, whatever.
01:06:43 And it got used up.
01:06:45 And now it's been like a week where there's like barely any toilet paper.
01:06:50 And I'm just, and I'm just kind of waiting for someone else to get some.
01:06:53 And nobody else is getting any.
01:06:55 They're just, they're just sitting around with their poopy butts.
01:06:59 I don't know what they're doing.
01:07:01 They don't know what they're doing.
01:07:02 Like, are they all just, everyone just have their own in their room that they
01:07:05 are like courting for themselves?
01:07:07 Possibly.
01:07:08 I remember I did that because I didn't like buying stuff for these people.
01:07:13 I mean, I would have it in my room.
01:07:15 I just, I just bought a bunch.
01:07:19 I'm, you know what?
01:07:19 I feel, I feel like I've kind of like an idiot because like I did it once and
01:07:24 nobody thanked me for it.
01:07:26 And now, nobody else is stepping up to do it.
01:07:32 So, yeah, I guess I'm kind of a rube.
01:07:33 I guess I'm the fool if I do.
01:07:35 But like, I kind of just want to probably, I'll probably just do it again.
01:07:40 It's hate, it's hate that everyone's got there.
01:07:42 Everyone's got their own secret toilet paper in their own, whatever.
01:07:47 It's fucking idiots.
01:07:49 Some, grow up.
01:07:50 Just grow up.
01:07:51 I'll do it.
01:07:52 I'll do it.
01:07:52 I don't care.
01:07:53 Be like 25 bucks and give a shit.
01:07:56 Annoying, though.
01:07:57 It's just, it's just the, it's just the principle.
01:07:59 It's just the principle that really, okay.
01:08:02 Everyone else is happy.
01:08:03 It's, it's a, what is it?
01:08:04 You know that meme?
01:08:05 It's like a political cartoon.
01:08:06 It's like a guy standing on a podium and it's like, who wants, who wants to
01:08:10 stay hydrated and everyone like raises their hand and is like, now who wants to
01:08:13 actually drink water and like nobody raises their hand you don't talk about?
01:08:18 I haven't seen that, but I get it.
01:08:20 Yeah.
01:08:20 Well, it's like, yeah.
01:08:22 Who wants to wipe their, who wants to wipe their ass?
01:08:24 Everyone.
01:08:25 Yeah.
01:08:25 Who wants to buy toilet paper?
01:08:27 Nobody.
01:08:30 It's really just one of those, like if you don't communicate with the house,
01:08:34 everybody is going to hope that every, like every other person does the things
01:08:38 that need to be done.
01:08:39 Yeah.
01:08:40 Well, somebody's, somebody's got to do, obviously somebody.
01:08:44 All right.
01:08:44 Here's what I'm going to do.
01:08:45 I'll do it again.
01:08:45 I'll do it one more time.
01:08:47 I'll buy a big case of it one more time.
01:08:49 And then when that runs out, I'll put a message in the group chat and be like,
01:08:53 Hey guys, I bought toilet paper for the house like twice now.
01:08:58 Could somebody else do it?
01:08:59 Could somebody else just do it, please?
01:09:02 Um, that's, that's my plan.
01:09:05 Good plan.
01:09:06 Yeah.
01:09:08 Let them feel guilt.
01:09:10 At least, at least they will be in pain.
01:09:12 Slight name and shame, name and shame.
01:09:15 That's the, that's the move.
01:09:16 Yes.
01:09:18 Um, there's also rats in my house.
01:09:21 Maybe they were using the toilet paper.
01:09:23 Yeah.
01:09:24 The last place had mice, which was gross.
01:09:27 This place, uh, apparently this is a new problem that was not a problem before.
01:09:32 Like other people have lived here for years and this has never happened before.
01:09:35 But there are like rats in the kitchen now and everyone is freaked out about it.
01:09:39 And there was a, there was a kerfuffle, there was a, no, there's a new landlord kerfuffle
01:09:44 because, and I didn't do this, but one of the other people here called the landlord.
01:09:50 And I guess, and I guess threatened the landlord with like, we're going to
01:09:54 withhold rent until the rat problem is done.
01:09:58 And apparently that didn't go so well.
01:10:02 Uh, but like he, they said like, okay, it's being handled.
01:10:06 They've got pest control guys on it.
01:10:07 Pest control guys are coming and they are checking on the house and they are
01:10:10 leaving traps and they are leaving poison and they are doing whatever they do to get
01:10:16 a house pest free.
01:10:18 So like, okay, cool.
01:10:20 Uh, glad it's being handled.
01:10:22 So we did not withhold rent this month.
01:10:25 I really hope it doesn't come to that.
01:10:27 I really do not want to get into a thing about it.
01:10:30 However, the rat situation is untenable.
01:10:32 It is unacceptable.
01:10:33 There are rats in the kitchen.
01:10:36 Like, that's disgusting.
01:10:37 That's vile.
01:10:38 Yeah.
01:10:40 Is it like rat poop?
01:10:42 Just on the floor sometimes?
01:10:43 I have not seen any rat poop.
01:10:48 I have seen the rats like eating out of the garbage.
01:10:51 Yikes.
01:10:52 Yeah.
01:10:54 So I mean, you know, we're all pretty upset about that.
01:11:02 Did you see summoning salt called me a nerd?
01:11:06 Uh, oh, I did.
01:11:08 Lol.
01:11:09 You you messaged or like added them on Twitter.
01:11:12 I said get owned with your with your video being top of search results for
01:11:17 Mega Man or something.
01:11:18 Yes.
01:11:19 When you searched and this was not not signed into my account, but when you
01:11:23 searched, uh, what was it when you searched Mega Man on YouTube, the first
01:11:28 result was my video, the second result was like a music video called the song of
01:11:35 a song called Mega Man by somebody called take a on a channel called the
01:11:40 shooters and I don't know.
01:11:42 I've never heard of that, but whatever it is, it's got 25 million views.
01:11:45 And then the third result was the summoning salt Mega Man to speed running
01:11:49 video.
01:11:50 So I told summoning salt to get owned and he responded and he said get owned.
01:11:57 Uh, by, he had a little image.
01:11:59 The image was him.
01:12:00 Girl, I'll just, I'll just post the image because it was kind of funny.
01:12:03 Ellie's are showed on screen right now.
01:12:05 Oh, I see.
01:12:06 He typed in nerdy, got you top of the list.
01:12:10 Top, top of the list, top of the list.
01:12:12 Hey, you know what?
01:12:12 That's, that's clout.
01:12:16 He, he ratio, I feel, I feel, I think it should be illegal to ratio someone when
01:12:20 you have more followers than them.
01:12:23 What did it, my, my, my tweet at him got like a, got like three or 400 and his
01:12:27 has a 1300, his reply has 1300 likes.
01:12:32 I don't know.
01:12:32 He's got a hundred.
01:12:32 He's got a hundred thousand followers though.
01:12:35 I think that, I think that spiritually I ratioed him actually.
01:12:40 The moral victory.
01:12:41 I think I would, I would call, I would definitely call this a moral victory
01:12:44 100% for sure.
01:12:47 Yeah.
01:12:48 Ah, base, base, base.
01:12:53 Um, damn.
01:12:56 Try to think of a.
01:12:58 Yeah, I can't think of anything off the top of my head.
01:13:03 You want to go to voicemails?
01:13:06 How long have you been going for?
01:13:08 It's just been an hour.
01:13:09 Oh, like it's a little early.
01:13:12 An hour, 20 minutes.
01:13:13 It's not that.
01:13:14 Um.
01:13:18 I don't know.
01:13:19 Uh, what are you thinking about for Christmas?
01:13:23 Um, I asked my mom, she asked what I want for Christmas.
01:13:26 And I, I said, I would like an immersion blender.
01:13:31 I would maybe like one of those magic bullet blenders.
01:13:35 I would maybe like a rice cooker.
01:13:37 But apparently there already is a rice cooker in this house.
01:13:40 It's just like the parts are like.
01:13:42 Not together.
01:13:42 I might have to like find the parts just like Z just like X in Mega Man X two.
01:13:48 I might have to like fight the fight the X hunters to collect the different parts
01:13:53 of the rice cooker and then put it all together.
01:13:56 Uh, oh, shit.
01:13:58 Wait, um, one piece.
01:14:03 Oh, fuck, I didn't read this week.
01:14:04 Oh, you got to read it.
01:14:05 There's a new chapter.
01:14:07 We got to do our corner.
01:14:08 I guess, I guess we could read it right now.
01:14:13 We could do the same thing as last time, but you're the one reading it.
01:14:16 Yeah, sure.
01:14:17 Let's let's do it.
01:14:18 I completely spaced on one piece.
01:14:20 Um, I should have reminded you.
01:14:22 I did see it and I was like, I should tell Ben in case, but I forgot.
01:14:25 You, it would have, uh, it would have helped, but no matter.
01:14:32 Okay.
01:14:33 Chapter 1068, a genius's dream.
01:14:38 An emotion.
01:14:39 Jerma 66 is an emotionless voyage.
01:14:42 These two once belonged in an organization called Mads.
01:14:47 Oh, uh, skip to this time code posted on the screen to get plus one piece.
01:14:53 We should make a time code for that.
01:14:56 Okay.
01:14:56 So, so I really, by the way, I realized that, um, the, the past, the pacifistas
01:15:02 with the dark skin and the wings, the luminarian, the luminarian pacifistas
01:15:08 are the seraphim.
01:15:09 Yeah.
01:15:10 Okay.
01:15:11 I didn't put that together last time, but I understand.
01:15:14 See, I don't want to say anything that you haven't read yet.
01:15:16 So I'm waiting for you to like, yeah, make comments.
01:15:19 I'm, I'm waiting until there's like something.
01:15:24 That I can come in and like, definitely comment on.
01:15:28 Wait a minute.
01:15:30 The grand line.
01:15:32 He pawpawed someone.
01:15:39 Who, who did he pawpaw?
01:15:40 Himself.
01:15:43 Like he's gone.
01:15:44 All of, all of those parts that were falling off of him and then he, he popped himself away.
01:15:48 Oh, that's him.
01:15:49 It's his, his robot guts coming out.
01:15:53 Yeah, they were repairing him or they were like trying to like undo the, the, uh, what
01:16:01 do you call it, like the pacifist station or whatever they would, you would say.
01:16:05 Oh, that's what they were doing.
01:16:08 The, the Revolutionary Army were doing that.
01:16:10 Okay.
01:16:10 That, that's, that's, um, presumably, I can't remember if they say it out right, but
01:16:15 like when they went to marriage water to save him, I think that was part of, there's
01:16:21 one of their objectives is to find and rescue Kuma so that they could undo the damage and
01:16:28 maybe get him back to his old self.
01:16:33 Okay.
01:16:36 I want to create a kind of world with science, a world where energy is widespread all over
01:16:40 the world free of charge.
01:16:42 Yeah.
01:16:42 Communism.
01:16:45 Yes.
01:16:46 Based, based the resources that produce energy are fought over in many countries.
01:16:51 Which when becomes the seed for war, you can feel energy here over there and everywhere
01:16:57 else, even though the world is full of it, they can convert it to visible power, a large
01:17:02 fuse of war.
01:17:03 Oh, wow.
01:17:04 Yeah, it's pretty good.
01:17:05 He wants to give everybody what they need so they don't need to fight anymore.
01:17:09 Ever, everybody, everybody has free energy.
01:17:12 God damn.
01:17:17 Sounds like I'm really interested.
01:17:19 Hmm.
01:17:20 I think a person that can make everyone happy is good.
01:17:23 I'm not interested in being a hero, though.
01:17:26 Okay.
01:17:32 Dynamic power source was able to power this ancient robot soldier.
01:17:36 Okay.
01:17:37 Okay.
01:17:37 Okay.
01:17:37 So he's looking into whatever powered this ancient technology.
01:17:42 Okay.
01:17:44 Yeah, this is Mega Man Legends right now.
01:17:46 And this is, they found ancient something or other.
01:17:50 Oh, they found, oh, it's a refractor.
01:17:51 Okay.
01:17:51 Thank you for putting it in terms that I can understand.
01:17:54 Okay.
01:17:54 So it's like a quantum refractor.
01:17:55 Okay.
01:17:56 No, gotcha.
01:18:03 I stepped too deep into the forbidden story.
01:18:05 I will be eliminated by the world government.
01:18:08 Just like what they did to Ohara.
01:18:11 That's not good.
01:18:13 CPO are those who only act under orders of celestial dragons, but it's CPO.
01:18:19 It's not CP9.
01:18:20 They are at the top of Cypherpole.
01:18:22 Oh, well, that must mean they're really powerful if the number went up.
01:18:27 Well, number went down.
01:18:28 It's CP0.
01:18:29 Oh, right, right, right.
01:18:31 It's so, so wacky that they don't even have it listed.
01:18:36 Everyone thinks it stops at CP9, except now everyone knows.
01:18:39 Except now everyone knows because it's no longer a mystery to the reader.
01:18:49 Chaka, CP0 is on the island.
01:18:55 OK, OK.
01:18:57 The CPO, I guess, is apparently here to kill
01:19:02 Vegapunk because he knows too much about the void century.
01:19:08 That makes sense.
01:19:08 That makes sense.
01:19:10 Sentomaru, wait, who's Sentomaru?
01:19:15 If you remember here, right, he appeared at
01:19:20 Shabaodi with the original Pesifista
01:19:25 and he was like in charge of them.
01:19:27 So I guess we're learning now that he's like a Vegapunk.
01:19:31 Like guy, like he's on this island.
01:19:34 I definitely recognize him.
01:19:36 I remember there was information about like his,
01:19:39 like being the grandson of somebody important or the son of someone.
01:19:44 Let me check.
01:19:45 Oh, he's the captain of the Marine Science Unit.
01:19:47 He calls Kizaru uncle, but that might not be
01:19:52 that might be a like a friendly thing rather than an actual family thing.
01:19:57 He might be calling him like Osan or something.
01:20:01 Is that the word for like an ojiki?
01:20:04 Ojiki.
01:20:07 Yakuza family, father, boss, yeah, it could be that.
01:20:11 But he's a Marine boy and he's a Vegapunk.
01:20:14 Marine science officer person who can control the Pesifista for some reason,
01:20:20 maybe just that they've been programmed to accept his orders.
01:20:24 Roku gun is the finger gun, right?
01:20:25 It's when they shoot the little.
01:20:28 Uh, I can't remember.
01:20:30 I remember Shoku gun.
01:20:33 It looks like he's.
01:20:35 Kick it out of the face or something.
01:20:36 It looks like he's exactly what he's doing.
01:20:39 He's jumped and his legs are like his knees bent and he's got his.
01:20:43 Yeah, he's probably doing the finger thing or like just punching really hard.
01:20:47 OK, all right.
01:20:50 So CP CP CP zero.
01:20:54 The kill Vegapunk.
01:20:56 Damn.
01:20:57 The thing I got from this chapter mostly is that Vegapunk has his like,
01:21:02 oh, this is my dream and, you know,
01:21:07 those straw hat pirates don't have an old man on the crew yet.
01:21:09 Maybe this is like a new crew member or at least it's certainly going to be temporary.
01:21:15 OK, certainly going to be temporary ill on the crew for like a while after this, possibly.
01:21:22 You know what?
01:21:23 I think I didn't even think about it, but like.
01:21:26 Yeah, that would be awesome.
01:21:28 That's so awesome.
01:21:29 Vegapunk rules.
01:21:30 Vegapunk so good.
01:21:32 So cool.
01:21:33 I hope I hope it's a good design.
01:21:36 You know, if we're if we're having like stupid new new team members.
01:21:41 Yeah, yeah, Vegapunk.
01:21:42 Yeah, please.
01:21:43 Yeah, it's it's because we've not known enough about Vegapunks like once
01:21:49 and like why he's working with the world government.
01:21:51 And it's, you know, last few chapters is like, oh, it's because
01:21:55 in order to pursue science, you need a lot of funds and you need a lot of,
01:21:59 you know, freedom to work.
01:22:01 Yeah. And so the world government can provide that for him.
01:22:03 And that's the only reason.
01:22:05 But he's getting close to some secrets that he shouldn't.
01:22:08 And so just so happens as the straw hats arrive.
01:22:12 That he needs to get out of there and he's going to be killed otherwise.
01:22:17 So like it's perfect time for him to stop being working with the world
01:22:20 government, stop being a pirate.
01:22:22 Yeah.
01:22:24 Certainly going to be like even he's already in outlaw, I guess.
01:22:28 Yeah, he's currently in, I mean, CP zero is like.
01:22:33 Implied to be super secret so that even the Marines don't know about them.
01:22:38 So like this is like an assassination attempt.
01:22:41 Yeah, he's not like publicly an enemy.
01:22:44 He's not publicly an enemy, but like, I don't know what will happen.
01:22:48 They are taking out.
01:22:49 It will be pretty cool if he gets a wanted poster after whatever's happening here.
01:22:55 And then he's like, oh, cool.
01:22:57 You want to join the crew or more likely, I think he's going to join the Revolutionary Army.
01:23:03 Because if Kuma is going to drop in, obviously, Jewelry Bonnie,
01:23:06 his daughter, they're going to have a thing.
01:23:09 There's also things that can happen.
01:23:10 I'm excited to see what's what's going on.
01:23:13 So there's like obviously, immediately, the two strongest guys
01:23:19 seeing each other, Luffy and Luchi, are they going to have a rematch right there?
01:23:24 Like how the fuck is that going to go?
01:23:26 So Kuma, he's still like, you know, a mindless robot.
01:23:31 Like the Revolutionary Army basically like kidnapped him against his will
01:23:34 to try and like undo the conditioning or the program or whatever.
01:23:41 I think it's it's not been made totally clear whether he has.
01:23:47 Like no sentience, he might just not be able to move.
01:23:52 Like he might not be like too far gone or anything.
01:23:58 But yeah, it seems like because there was that part where he
01:24:03 in during the time skip, protected the Straw Hats, protected Sunigo,
01:24:08 the ship from being attacked for like those full two years.
01:24:12 And then he left, which seems like somebody programmed him to do that.
01:24:16 Because otherwise he's completely controlled by the the world government and the Marines.
01:24:22 Oh, I forgot about that.
01:24:25 Yeah, Frankie or someone just sees him and he's just sitting there and then he stands up
01:24:30 and he leaves, doesn't say a word.
01:24:36 Yeah, that's fucked up.
01:24:37 That's really weird that that happened.
01:24:40 Hmm.
01:24:42 It's probably going to be very sad if he if he arrives.
01:24:46 I don't know why he's going there.
01:24:49 But like if he's been like called somehow.
01:24:51 You think he's going to Egghead?
01:24:54 I mean, it seems the most logical place.
01:24:57 Yeah.
01:24:58 Like he got some sort of notification and he's like zapping himself over there.
01:25:04 And then maybe jewelry Bonnie will see her dad.
01:25:09 But he won't be able to say anything.
01:25:10 He'll still be like an automaton, maybe.
01:25:13 Yeah.
01:25:16 I I mean, I just I just don't know.
01:25:20 Just don't know what's going on with him.
01:25:22 I mean, I guess who was it that said that he was an asshole?
01:25:25 Was it was it?
01:25:28 Fuck, what's Shark Man's name?
01:25:29 I'm forgetting.
01:25:30 Jin Bay.
01:25:31 This Jin Jin Bay was the one that said like he was like a tyrant.
01:25:35 He was like a douchebag king.
01:25:40 But now he's like now he's a row.
01:25:44 He's been reprogrammed for the Marines.
01:25:47 But also he seems to like secretly be working on behalf of the Straw Hats.
01:25:52 And more like the Revolutionary Army.
01:25:55 Yeah.
01:25:56 Yeah.
01:25:56 Which so like maybe from Dragon somehow or Vega Punk.
01:26:01 Yeah.
01:26:01 Yeah.
01:26:02 Some deep code inside him that allows him to to do good still.
01:26:10 Yeah, we're going to learn a lot more about all that for sure.
01:26:13 Yeah.
01:26:16 I mean, hype.
01:26:19 I like I like I think Kuma is pretty cool.
01:26:22 I'm interested.
01:26:24 I'm really yeah.
01:26:26 This these revelations these Vega Punk revelations are pretty pretty cool.
01:26:30 Pretty pretty exciting.
01:26:32 Pretty like what's what's his what's his role going to be.
01:26:38 Yeah, he might I could see him joining the Revolutionary Army for sure.
01:26:42 So fucking base fucking epic.
01:26:46 It's awesome.
01:26:47 It's awesome.
01:26:48 I notice in this that one panel where the the the seraphim that they were returning.
01:26:55 Bear looks like Kuma.
01:26:57 Yeah.
01:26:57 They called it B Bear or S Bear or something.
01:27:00 S Bear.
01:27:02 Like seraphim bear because yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:27:05 I do notice that he is shaded is to have darker skin.
01:27:09 So you were correct.
01:27:10 I think sometimes sometimes he is.
01:27:13 It's kind of inconsistent panel to panel.
01:27:17 Which one are you looking at?
01:27:19 We'll look at this one.
01:27:21 He's he's not he's not shaded here.
01:27:25 I think he is.
01:27:26 Oh no, he kind of is a little bit.
01:27:27 I see.
01:27:28 I see it's it's faint, but it's probably like a bad scan.
01:27:32 A bad scan.
01:27:32 Yeah, because like it's not pure white like it would be if it was just, you know,
01:27:37 unshaded.
01:27:37 I feel like there's a half tone in there.
01:27:39 Oh wait.
01:27:40 This is like because you see his hair is like white and it's lighter.
01:27:46 OK, this is we're doing we're doing phrenology on this on this Kuma clone.
01:27:52 Well, this is his hands here look like they might be shaded.
01:27:58 I'm trying to find one that's clearer because OK.
01:28:02 Well, the point being the the the similarities to King having the black wings
01:28:09 and the white hair and the darker skin.
01:28:12 He does have the white hair for sure.
01:28:13 Oh, that one.
01:28:14 I didn't notice that one.
01:28:15 Yeah, that's just this one.
01:28:16 He just not looked at all all it's going to take all I need is one panel where it's like
01:28:21 very clearly like they definitely like made a visible like shading to differentiate his color.
01:28:32 All you need is one example and I'll be like, OK, I'm sold.
01:28:35 I don't need whoa.
01:28:38 Sorry, I sneezed.
01:28:41 Did it sound loud?
01:28:43 Yeah, it did.
01:28:45 But like muffled distance.
01:28:47 I muffled it with the with the blanket.
01:28:51 I think it's probably the case that he looks like a lumarian.
01:28:55 But I feel like I feel like none of these panels show it very well.
01:28:59 But I'll wait.
01:29:02 We'll wait and see.
01:29:05 Yeah, so like I think I said last time last time we talked to one piece that like
01:29:12 I don't feel like Egg Island is going to be particularly long.
01:29:17 Definitely not as long as one or not sort of feels.
01:29:20 I mean, we just got here like three chapters ago.
01:29:23 Yeah.
01:29:24 And the battle is on.
01:29:26 Yeah, already like Luchi and Luffy are there.
01:29:31 Fighting is happening.
01:29:32 And I don't believe anything else is going to come up other than Kuma.
01:29:37 I feel like this is going to be like a short confrontation followed by maybe Kuma arrives
01:29:45 to save the straw hats and blast them away somewhere because Bonnie is with them.
01:29:51 Yeah, it doesn't feel like they're setting up like a big sort of like sprawling backstory
01:30:00 that all culminates in a big like battle like like they did with, you know,
01:30:06 a Wano or anything like that.
01:30:08 Yeah, although I am curious.
01:30:10 I wonder if like the different.
01:30:13 Do you think there's anything more to like the backstories of the different
01:30:16 uh, uh, vagabunk pieces that is like or or just not he just made them.
01:30:24 I mean, I think the like the the it's a lot of it's been explained by him saying
01:30:32 this island has some ancient technologies and I derived a lot of my science stuff from what we
01:30:38 found and that's just sort of like that's how he's so smart and has so many good technologies.
01:30:45 Hmm.
01:30:46 Also, my brain is this giant building and it's gathering information.
01:30:50 That's also helpful.
01:30:55 Because what's interesting here that the their ship, the ship zero
01:31:00 fucking ship was eaten by the the the sea beasts, sea beast guys.
01:31:07 Is that is that what happened to the ship?
01:31:10 Yeah, because Luchi said, I know we won't be able to like
01:31:15 as soon as we attack our ship will be destroyed.
01:31:18 So we got to get on that quick.
01:31:20 And so they they abandoned their ship so that they can get in.
01:31:23 Did the ship get destroyed?
01:31:25 Yeah, there's a thing with like the what are they?
01:31:29 What's the word?
01:31:30 Not real, not manmade sea.
01:31:33 Artificial.
01:31:34 No, artificial.
01:31:35 Natural.
01:31:36 Artificial sea beasts.
01:31:37 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
01:31:39 They ate it.
01:31:40 And then I see them like looming around the ship.
01:31:43 There's a panel later where it's it's shown.
01:31:46 Okay.
01:31:46 That they're doing that.
01:31:47 I believe you.
01:31:48 I believe it.
01:31:48 Well, just take a little screen grab.
01:31:51 Yeah, it's it's what's his face?
01:31:54 You're speaking of Mega Man.
01:31:56 Some of these guys do look like Mega Man enemies.
01:31:59 Oh, yeah, these these little robot little robot eyes.
01:32:03 There's two.
01:32:06 There's two robot dudes among the.
01:32:10 The Vegapunk people.
01:32:13 Just some of them look like robot.
01:32:15 No, there's three.
01:32:15 Well, there's three if you count Daft Punk.
01:32:17 There's Daft Punk and then there's two like the little like clanky like oval men.
01:32:22 Yeah, they're definitely Mega Man people.
01:32:27 Definitely.
01:32:28 Definitely Mega Man.
01:32:30 Actually, I mean, Daft Punk does look sort of like the Valiant enemies from X4 vials like soldiers.
01:32:41 So, you know, I guess they're all Mega Man, actually, when you really when you really think about it.
01:32:48 You have to wonder about it.
01:32:51 I have to wonder how strong like Luchi and Kaku have become since water seven and all that.
01:32:58 Yeah, because they're the top level guys.
01:33:02 This is the level of guys that were at Wano with their funny masks playing like Othello or whatever.
01:33:12 At Wano?
01:33:14 Yeah, there was the two really tall guys holding masks on their face and then the shorter guy
01:33:20 with just sort of goggles and they were like in a room.
01:33:25 What?
01:33:26 And they were like, hmm, the insurgents have like 3000 strong, but Kaido's army has like 16,000.
01:33:38 But they're turning the tide of battle.
01:33:39 That's those guys.
01:33:41 They were like commentating what was happening.
01:33:45 Wait, who?
01:33:46 Who were they?
01:33:47 I mean, I remember that scene.
01:33:49 I remember that scene.
01:33:50 I don't remember who was saying it.
01:33:52 It was, I mean, I don't know their names, but they're like sheepie zero as well.
01:33:58 And they interfered with Kaido's battle.
01:34:00 Oh, oh, yeah.
01:34:03 Okay, wait, I didn't realize those guys were CP.
01:34:07 Yeah, that's their hair on special business, but it just so happens.
01:34:10 Oh, you're right.
01:34:11 All that shit was happening.
01:34:12 Yes, yes, yes.
01:34:13 I remember now.
01:34:14 Okay, okay.
01:34:17 So these guys, yeah.
01:34:19 They're the same level.
01:34:20 So like, they're definitely going to be strong.
01:34:22 Did we see those guys fight?
01:34:25 There was a part when shit was going down that they had to go and intervene.
01:34:30 So like one of them died, I'm pretty sure.
01:34:34 Oh, shit.
01:34:34 They fought, they fought X-Drake.
01:34:37 I guess somewhere.
01:34:38 Yeah, yeah.
01:34:39 There was a few confrontation.
01:34:40 I can't remember exactly who fought.
01:34:41 X-Drake and Killer?
01:34:45 X-Drake and Apu, I think.
01:34:48 Yeah, Killer was there.
01:34:49 They were like forced to team up.
01:34:51 Killer was fighting against them.
01:34:53 Or no, Killer was fighting against Kid.
01:34:57 Why would Killer fight against Kid?
01:34:58 No, he was fighting against, not Dracula Mihawk, the straw guy, the voodoo doll guy.
01:35:06 Yes, Basil Hawkins.
01:35:08 Basil Hawkins, yes, yes, yes.
01:35:13 So many fucking characters that you track up.
01:35:16 There was like a hundred fucking fights in 1-0.
01:35:19 It's unbelievable.
01:35:24 But yeah, those guys were very strong and they only really,
01:35:30 like if they were completely let loose, they would have done some massive damage.
01:35:33 I think there was like that part where the big ghost, the flame ghost was traveling down and
01:35:39 it blocked off those guys from fighting Usopp or something.
01:35:45 Oh, the big like goopy flame thing that was burrowing down through the castle.
01:35:48 Yeah, and it was going down.
01:35:50 It was going to blow up the big explosives at the bottom.
01:35:56 I didn't even remember how that was stopped.
01:35:59 Do you remember how that was stopped?
01:36:01 No, I don't.
01:36:02 Yamato was running to catch it, but what did she do in the end?
01:36:06 I don't remember.
01:36:10 Wait, I think he threw all the bombs down into the floor and then they exploded.
01:36:20 But like in the middle of the sky, instead of it, I can't remember exactly.
01:36:24 Like it dropped out the bottom of the city and it blew up in the air.
01:36:29 Yeah, something like that.
01:36:30 That sounds...
01:36:33 There was like seven different ticking clocks.
01:36:36 There was so many fucking...
01:36:38 If this happens, everyone dies and if this happens, everyone dies.
01:36:41 But then if this happens, everyone dies and the island falls
01:36:43 and kills everyone below it as well.
01:36:46 So we want the first option where everyone dies.
01:36:50 We don't want the second one because there's other even worse things happen as well.
01:36:54 It's not just that everything was going to explode and fall out of the sky.
01:37:00 The island will fall out of the sky, so Momo had to make clouds.
01:37:06 We're talking about the difference between a sky lagoon and a space station Eurasia,
01:37:12 a space colony Eurasia here.
01:37:13 Oh, yeah.
01:37:14 It's tomato tomorrow.
01:37:16 There's difference of scale.
01:37:17 But then also there was a fire and everything was burning and everyone was going to burn to death.
01:37:23 Yeah.
01:37:24 And then everyone was going to drown because it was too late.
01:37:26 And it was going to blow up the weapons stash in the bottom of the floating castle.
01:37:30 Yeah, there was like so many different possible ways that everybody could die.
01:37:35 And then if Luffy dies, Kaida would come down and kill everyone as well.
01:37:39 Right.
01:37:41 Yeah.
01:37:41 It's so fucked.
01:37:44 And then it all happened as well.
01:37:45 It was honestly really difficult.
01:37:49 I don't even remember half of these things.
01:37:52 Oh, yeah, that did happen, didn't it?
01:37:54 Like, oh my god.
01:37:56 Yeah, I kind of imagined reading it all in one go because week by week it was like,
01:38:01 holy shit, so much happens in one chapter and then whole other sets of things happen in the next.
01:38:08 I did.
01:38:09 It might have hurt my reading comprehension a bit to binge it, but it's okay.
01:38:15 I got the gist.
01:38:20 But yeah, this is not setting up to be anywhere near as long just purely because of the amount
01:38:24 of characters.
01:38:25 Like, there's three CP0 and Luchi and Kaku are probably pretty strong.
01:38:33 Stussy was that whole cake.
01:38:36 I don't remember if she did anything combat wise.
01:38:39 The girl?
01:38:40 Is it the silk girl?
01:38:42 No, no, no.
01:38:42 That's Khalifa.
01:38:45 Stussy or Stussy was like, Sussie is better.
01:38:49 Stussy was like-
01:38:50 Wait, is that the one in the chicken mask?
01:38:54 Yeah, she's wearing a funny mask.
01:38:55 I don't know why.
01:38:56 Oh, I guess she's part of CP0 the whole time.
01:38:59 Like, she was like-
01:39:00 I don't remember if she does like it all to be perfectly-
01:39:03 She was at the wedding between Pudding and Sanji as an invited guest because she's
01:39:11 a very important person for various reasons I can't remember.
01:39:14 But while she was there, she secretly was being undercover agent for the world government.
01:39:20 She's CP0.
01:39:22 She has knowledge and she let the world government know what happened.
01:39:27 Because you know Captain Morgan, not Captain Morgan.
01:39:31 Fuckin' Morgan the Big Bird.
01:39:32 There could be a Captain.
01:39:34 Oh yeah, the news guy, the news bird.
01:39:36 Yeah, Morgan the news bird was there and he spread-
01:39:38 I love Morgan the news bird.
01:39:40 Yes, he's so good.
01:39:42 He's like a dastardly devil, Big Bird from-
01:39:46 He's a dastardly devil.
01:39:47 He's like a freedom of speech guy, but in a good way.
01:39:54 He's like an actual freedom of speech guy.
01:39:58 Yes, and he spread the news in a way that he wanted it to be spread about Whole Cake.
01:40:05 And that led, I think, to Luffy being branded one of the new Yonko, like the five emperors.
01:40:11 He was one of them now.
01:40:13 I was like, I'm not sure about that, said everyone.
01:40:17 Isn't his name literally like News Morgan?
01:40:21 Yeah, Big News Morgan.
01:40:22 People just call him Big News.
01:40:26 Should have called him like Big Scoop.
01:40:29 I like Big News Morgan.
01:40:30 Not Big News is good.
01:40:33 But yeah, he was there.
01:40:34 He spun it the way he did on the newspaper.
01:40:37 But Stussy, Stussy, they're not a saying.
01:40:42 Wait a minute, wait a minute.
01:40:42 Okay, Lucci's got a chicken sitting on his shoulder.
01:40:45 Is that Stussy?
01:40:47 No, no, that's the pigeon.
01:40:48 Do you not remember?
01:40:49 He had a pigeon the whole time back in water seven.
01:40:53 That's just a pet pigeon that he has?
01:40:56 Yes.
01:40:56 He, if you remember, when he was introduced, he was like, didn't say anything.
01:41:01 But the pigeon sort of spoke for him.
01:41:03 And that was his gimmick.
01:41:05 And you didn't know how strong he was until he revealed himself to be a member of CP9.
01:41:09 And then he started talking and he was evil.
01:41:11 I do not remember that at all.
01:41:14 Do you remember they worked for, like, they were undercover.
01:41:18 They worked him and Kaku and Khalifa.
01:41:21 Do they work for Tom?
01:41:23 Or no, not Tom.
01:41:23 They work for Icebar or Iceberg for Galila Company, the shipwrights.
01:41:31 With fucking Pauly.
01:41:32 And I think that's it.
01:41:35 There was some other guys.
01:41:36 Yes, I do remember that.
01:41:38 Don't remember the pigeon, but okay.
01:41:41 Yeah, the pigeon was there as his, like, I speak through my pigeon thing.
01:41:46 I don't know why, but like, I guess the pigeon is strong as well,
01:41:49 because he's got his own fucking tie and hat.
01:41:52 He would have to be.
01:41:53 He would have to be.
01:41:55 I don't see, oh wait, no, I see Stussy.
01:41:58 I think in this panel with the kuma facing away, I think I see her like silhouette.
01:42:06 Yeah, she has a few speaking bits, like when Kaku tries to jump
01:42:09 and then there's the force field, she's got the chicken mask on.
01:42:13 But like, what's her power?
01:42:15 What's her deal?
01:42:16 I don't know, but she revealed herself to be a secret government agent
01:42:22 instead of whoever else she was at the whole cake wedding.
01:42:26 When shit went down, she sort of snuck away and she had that bomb.
01:42:30 I think her briefcase had the bomb in it and the bomb went off.
01:42:34 Or maybe someone else had the bomb.
01:42:36 She's the one in like the fluffy feather mask.
01:42:39 Yeah, yeah.
01:42:40 Okay, okay, okay, okay.
01:42:43 Yeah, what was that bomb?
01:42:45 Wait, there was a bomb?
01:42:46 You're talking about Sanji's wedding?
01:42:48 Yeah, Sanji's wedding.
01:42:49 Do you remember, I forget exactly what I think the briefcase was given to somebody
01:42:58 by fucking the Fishman Island people.
01:43:03 They gave it as a reward or a gift, but it's a bomb.
01:43:07 Oh my God, it's just like bullet train.
01:43:10 This is the plot of bullet train.
01:43:12 What even the fuck was that bomb?
01:43:14 I can't remember, but I think she was there when that happened.
01:43:20 I forget.
01:43:21 Yeah, I vaguely remember a briefcase with a bomb in it.
01:43:25 Maybe, I guess.
01:43:27 Because the big fucking cake, like mountain, the whole cake,
01:43:35 the wedding was being at the top of, that got exploded and it fell down.
01:43:41 Yes.
01:43:43 And it was frosting everywhere.
01:43:45 That feels true.
01:43:47 Agent of CPG, in her cover as an Emperor of the Underworld, that's right.
01:43:51 She was an underworld person, does shady deals in the similar vein, I guess, to Doflamingo.
01:44:01 She's just sort of part of the underbelly.
01:44:03 And so she was invited to this wedding.
01:44:07 Good for her.
01:44:07 And good for her, girl boss.
01:44:09 And she is, yeah.
01:44:12 All right.
01:44:13 Epithet Queen of the Pleasure District.
01:44:15 Oh, she's like a...
01:44:16 On a whole case?
01:44:19 Yeah, that's what she was called.
01:44:20 Or that's what her alias is.
01:44:24 It could be that she is both that and a member of CP Zero.
01:44:27 Oh, okay.
01:44:28 But that implies that she's like a super rich brothel owner or something.
01:44:38 She owns every brothel in the world.
01:44:40 Good for her, girl boss.
01:44:42 Hell yes.
01:44:43 Hell yeah.
01:44:44 Okay, it's good to review all this stuff because I feel like I've forgotten more than half of it.
01:44:56 More than half of everything that's happened.
01:45:02 There's always...
01:45:03 I mean, it was always a thing in the podcast as well.
01:45:05 Nate had a lot of stuff memorized, more than me.
01:45:10 Really?
01:45:10 And whenever I got something wrong, he would say, no, don't you remember?
01:45:14 You fool.
01:45:15 700 chapters ago, there was this said.
01:45:17 I think it's because he keeps up with discussions on chapters.
01:45:21 He probably reads discussion on 4chan.
01:45:26 Or somewhere else, maybe.
01:45:28 Where people pool their knowledge and reference things.
01:45:30 I'm like, I don't really care about all that stuff.
01:45:32 Just like Vegapunk's giant brain in the egghead loft.
01:45:36 Yes.
01:45:38 Vegapunk's egghead brain knows what the will of D means.
01:45:42 Vegapunk's egghead brain could tell you what Stussy's devil fruit power is.
01:45:46 He's been paying attention.
01:45:48 Well, I could read the wiki.
01:45:49 What's her power?
01:45:51 Infiltration skills.
01:45:53 It's not a devil.
01:45:55 She's so fucking sneaky.
01:45:56 She can tiptoe like no one's business.
01:45:59 I mean, I guess if she's CP, she's probably a zoan.
01:46:02 But you never know.
01:46:07 Doesn't seem to have any.
01:46:09 Might have just not been revealed yet.
01:46:12 Cypherpole doesn't necessarily have animals.
01:46:14 I think that was just like a CP9 specific thing.
01:46:17 BlueKnow was also CP and he did not have zoan.
01:46:21 Get a door fruit.
01:46:22 He had the doa fruit, yeah.
01:46:24 The doa doa fruit, but he had like long bullhorn hairstyle.
01:46:30 He looked like he was obviously going to have a bull zoan, but then he just didn't.
01:46:36 Everyone else had a zoan.
01:46:37 And if you remember Califa, she had the soap thing.
01:46:40 Yes, yes, the soap.
01:46:41 She made a big like woollen sheep coat of like soap.
01:46:45 And then she put her arms around in like a C shape to look like lamb horns.
01:46:50 And she did like a pose and she was like a sheep.
01:46:52 And like Nami was like, cut that shit out.
01:46:54 That's stupid.
01:46:55 Oh, yeah.
01:46:58 So like all of them can be an animal.
01:47:00 They're all like sort of an animal.
01:47:03 Especially the ones that literally are.
01:47:05 Some of them are literally just are and the ones that aren't sort of pretend.
01:47:10 Yeah, I love that moment.
01:47:13 That was such a good one.
01:47:14 Yeah, you're feeling me with fond memories of a time when I was surprised and delighted.
01:47:22 It's always a good thing.
01:47:27 Yeah.
01:47:29 So what else happened in the chapter?
01:47:31 Yeah, just they arrived.
01:47:32 CP9 has made their landing and.
01:47:35 Yeah, oh, yeah.
01:47:36 This is what I was going to.
01:47:37 This is what I was going to say.
01:47:38 There's three members.
01:47:39 It's going to be hard to stop calling them CP9.
01:47:42 Yeah, CP0.
01:47:44 There's three members here.
01:47:45 Presumably they're all very strong.
01:47:49 Luchi is probably the strongest.
01:47:50 Yeah.
01:47:51 But they're up against the entirety of the Straw Hat crew, which is very strong.
01:47:58 Like cumulatively.
01:47:59 They beat him.
01:48:00 Like individually.
01:48:02 They beat him once.
01:48:03 And like obviously Luchi is a lot stronger.
01:48:05 Luchi is probably a lot stronger as well.
01:48:06 But like what chance does CP0 really have to do anything here?
01:48:11 Luchi couldn't fight the whole crew.
01:48:13 He couldn't fight the whole crew, I don't think.
01:48:15 And he certainly couldn't fight the whole crew plus every Seraphim.
01:48:20 Every Seraphim and all these Vegapunk people who I assume have like crazy powers.
01:48:27 So like what are they going to do?
01:48:29 Kuma is going to appear.
01:48:31 It might be that Kuma turns the tide.
01:48:32 And if he's working for CP0, he'll like do something real bad.
01:48:38 Yeah, I don't know.
01:48:39 Like what even what even could happen?
01:48:44 That's what we're going to find out the next chapter one piece.
01:48:47 Okay, CP's goal, they're just on an assassination mission, right?
01:48:51 They're just like assassinate Vegapunk.
01:48:53 That seems to be their goal.
01:48:56 Yeah, I suppose it'll be like get Vegapunk out of here.
01:49:01 Because he's like a little, he's an old man.
01:49:05 He's not physically strong.
01:49:07 He's just got a funny brain double fruit and a lot of tech.
01:49:13 So if they get him, then he's gut.
01:49:16 Yeah, he's also got like, I guess he, I guess he, did we really,
01:49:20 did we know that he was just like projecting a hologram this whole time?
01:49:24 I think we didn't.
01:49:25 No, we didn't.
01:49:25 Oh, okay.
01:49:27 I don't think so.
01:49:28 Maybe somebody else was projecting a hologram.
01:49:30 Someone, someone was projecting a hologram.
01:49:33 I think what it was is like we see him half stuck in something and he said,
01:49:38 oh no, the teleport didn't work again.
01:49:41 So it's presumed that he teleported his physical body.
01:49:45 Or it could be that he just has the ability to teleport around his island.
01:49:51 So like he's just doing another teleport and that was his physical body.
01:49:54 That's how he teleports.
01:49:55 Maybe, yeah, maybe.
01:50:00 I wonder, would be pretty interesting to see him fight like what,
01:50:06 what abilities does he have?
01:50:09 Like, or has the, I assume he has made devices for himself.
01:50:14 He's probably got some devices, some gadgets, some gizmos.
01:50:18 I, I think there's no, there's no doubt, no doubt about the gadgets and gizmos.
01:50:27 Damn, I wish there was more.
01:50:32 Looking forward to continuing this journey.
01:50:40 You there?
01:50:42 Yeah.
01:50:42 Yeah, I'm just, I'm trying to see like this last image.
01:50:49 What's her face?
01:50:50 What's her name?
01:50:52 Monster Atlas.
01:50:53 It's Atlas, the big girl.
01:50:55 The big one.
01:50:56 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:50:57 I thought that was one of those, I thought that was one of those giant,
01:51:00 I thought that was one of those giant kids from,
01:51:04 where were the giant kids?
01:51:06 From punk hazard, the, the experiments that Caesar clown was doing on those
01:51:10 children because Big Mom wanted to make a race of giants for her family.
01:51:14 That's the one, that's the one.
01:51:16 Yes.
01:51:17 But I guess she's not, unless maybe she is.
01:51:20 No, she's just, she's just big.
01:51:21 She might just be big.
01:51:22 Are they, are they all robots?
01:51:25 I would assume they're all like entirely artificial.
01:51:29 Yeah.
01:51:30 I mean, maybe not.
01:51:31 I know, I've no reason to believe either way.
01:51:34 I just assume that they're completely robotic.
01:51:37 Yeah, I guess that's probably a, like, since they're all seemed, they're all a set.
01:51:45 So probably they're all the same type of thing and some of them are definitely robots.
01:51:49 So probably all of them are robots.
01:51:52 Oh my God.
01:51:54 Like Mega Man.
01:51:56 They're so mega.
01:51:59 Yeah.
01:51:59 Okay.
01:52:00 I mean, that makes sense.
01:52:01 Is Vegapunk a wily or a light?
01:52:03 Vegapunk, more like Megapunk.
01:52:05 What, what?
01:52:06 Megapunk.
01:52:13 Sanji kind of has like,
01:52:14 we've been seeing Sanji in a second.
01:52:18 He was with, who was he with?
01:52:23 I forget.
01:52:23 I guess we haven't seen much of him.
01:52:24 I don't think he was even in this chapter at all.
01:52:27 Yeah.
01:52:27 No, he's, he's with one of the groups.
01:52:29 I don't think it, yeah, the two on the ship are Zoro and Brooke.
01:52:34 Right.
01:52:35 They, they haven't done anything.
01:52:36 They've just been chilling.
01:52:37 And then.
01:52:38 But they probably have definitely heard the explosion.
01:52:40 So we might be thinking.
01:52:41 Here with Vegapunk is Luffy and Chopper and Jinbei and Nami?
01:52:47 Is Nami here?
01:52:48 Yeah.
01:52:49 No, Bonnie.
01:52:51 Okay.
01:52:51 So Sanji and Nami and Robin and Frankie are somewhere else?
01:52:57 And Usopp.
01:52:58 Yeah.
01:52:58 And Usopp.
01:52:58 What are they doing?
01:53:00 They went up into the place and they were looking around.
01:53:04 Oh, um, what's, Kali, no, the girl, the girl Vegapunk is taking them to go and look at like
01:53:10 the Seraphim chambers or up to see the punk, the punk archives?
01:53:17 Something.
01:53:18 Yes.
01:53:18 Yeah.
01:53:19 They, they met up with, with Daft Punk and he started saying things.
01:53:24 Oh, right.
01:53:24 Yeah.
01:53:24 They're, they're with Daft Punk.
01:53:28 They're in the control tower.
01:53:29 And also the evil girl.
01:53:31 Seeing, seeing everything.
01:53:31 Also, is that a, is that a joke like Vegapunk, Daft Punk?
01:53:36 Is that like, is that a joke?
01:53:39 Is that on purpose?
01:53:40 I mean, I feel like Daft Punk is famous enough and that design is like similar enough that it was
01:53:46 probably true, like, yes, like a reference.
01:53:49 Like he, he looks like Daft Punk on purpose, right?
01:53:51 That's not, that's not a coincidence.
01:53:53 Oh yeah.
01:53:53 Okay.
01:53:54 Yeah.
01:53:54 Yeah.
01:53:55 Everyone loves Daft Punk robot designs.
01:53:57 Yeah.
01:53:57 Okay.
01:53:58 Just check it.
01:54:02 It would be cool if there was like a Mega Man reference in this, in this whole thing,
01:54:06 you know, like an explicit one.
01:54:09 I, I mean, I would be, I would be, I would soy face.
01:54:14 I would soy face.
01:54:15 Uh, you know, a couple people have said that like
01:54:19 Mega, people have definitely said that Mega Man is just a ripoff of Astro Boy.
01:54:24 And I've don't, I have never read Astro Boy.
01:54:26 So like, I'm sure that to a certain extent that, that's definitely true.
01:54:31 But like,
01:54:31 I, I would think a lot of, a lot of the trappings.
01:54:35 Yeah.
01:54:36 A lot of the trappings of the design, like Astro Boy is a young boy.
01:54:39 There's, there's scientists that have like lost a child and turned a, made a robot son.
01:54:47 Yeah.
01:54:48 I forget like how the law, like I haven't read all of Astro Boy.
01:54:51 I mostly know Astro Boy law from the GBA game Omega Factor, which is like the best GBA game ever.
01:54:58 Really?
01:54:59 Uh, well, as a game, it's fine.
01:55:01 But like the, the, it really tugs on your heartstrings.
01:55:04 The story is really good.
01:55:06 Oh, wow.
01:55:06 And it's, it's because that draws from every Tezuka work ever, every character from his
01:55:13 entire library of stuff.
01:55:14 And they just make a unique story building with, with all those building blocks.
01:55:18 And Astro Boy does deal a lot with the sentient of robots, humans versus robots.
01:55:25 Yeah.
01:55:25 And like, and power dynamics and, uh, like who should live?
01:55:30 Who should be like the tough questions.
01:55:33 So it's, and then there's this cute little boy,
01:55:35 this cute little boy with an R, a gun on his arm.
01:55:37 Yeah.
01:55:37 It's a space.
01:55:38 Does, does Astro Boy have a gun on his arm?
01:55:41 He, his arm turns into a gun.
01:55:42 Oh, okay.
01:55:43 So yeah, just like, just like Mega Man.
01:55:46 Yeah.
01:55:47 Cool.
01:55:48 Uh, oh no, I wasted my time.
01:55:51 I wasted my time.
01:55:52 I experienced the derivative work of media.
01:55:55 No.
01:55:57 Gringe.
01:55:59 I love Astro Boy so much.
01:56:01 I should read everything.
01:56:03 I'm sorry.
01:56:03 I've read like a couple books.
01:56:04 They made, they made a, they made a GBA game that's just like a mishmash,
01:56:09 melange of all of like Tezuka's classic manga characters.
01:56:14 Yeah.
01:56:14 That sounds amazing.
01:56:15 This, it is great.
01:56:17 You should play Omega Factor.
01:56:19 I think, I'm intrigued.
01:56:22 I think you would enjoy it.
01:56:23 Although I mean, I'm not, I haven't really read,
01:56:26 I haven't really read much Tezuka, to be honest.
01:56:28 I don't, I don't know anything.
01:56:29 I didn't know anything about any Tezuka before I played that game.
01:56:34 But like, it's, it's good.
01:56:38 There's like Blackjack, the, the surgeon.
01:56:41 And there's fucking Kimba.
01:56:43 That was Tezuka.
01:56:43 Kimba's in there.
01:56:45 Well, it's like cartoon all stars to the rescue.
01:56:50 Yeah.
01:56:51 But, but good.
01:56:52 But good.
01:56:53 It's, it's really good.
01:56:56 People cry.
01:56:57 I cry at the end of that game.
01:56:58 That's the, that's the sort of,
01:57:01 that's what they call good story writing.
01:57:02 That's what you call, that's what you call epic.
01:57:08 I don't know.
01:57:11 I have to pee.
01:57:13 I'll be back.
01:57:14 Okay.
01:57:16 Not to change the subject or anything.
01:57:19 Although going into the bathroom and seeing no toilet paper
01:57:24 just reminded me about my new housemates.
01:57:28 And it reminded, and I was reminded.
01:57:31 But the other day, one of them mentioned that he was like
01:57:35 thinking about starting a podcast.
01:57:38 And I was like, oh no.
01:57:40 You haven't told them, I assume.
01:57:42 No.
01:57:43 I was like, I can't let this guy know.
01:57:46 I can't fucking let this guy know.
01:57:50 I told one guy that I was working on a YouTube video.
01:57:55 Which you were.
01:57:56 Which I was.
01:57:56 Yeah.
01:57:57 Yeah.
01:57:57 That was a cup like a little while ago.
01:57:59 He asked me like what I do.
01:58:00 And I said, oh, you know, post stuff on the internet.
01:58:03 I've worked on YouTube.
01:58:04 Oh, I'm just posting.
01:58:05 I'm just posting.
01:58:08 Some people are just born posters.
01:58:13 But I didn't mention a podcast.
01:58:15 And this guy, he just offhandedly, he just saw I had a microphone.
01:58:20 And he asked me like what I use it for.
01:58:22 And I said, oh, you know, I record stuff with friends on, you know, sometimes.
01:58:27 And he was like, oh, yeah, yeah.
01:58:29 I mean, there's something about, I don't remember what he said.
01:58:32 He said something about, he says something about he had a friend who like
01:58:36 was starting a podcast.
01:58:38 And he was like, maybe I should start a pocket.
01:58:39 And I was like, ah, no.
01:58:41 Imagine if it all converged like you're all in your separate rooms,
01:58:46 making podcasts at the same time.
01:58:48 We become a post.
01:58:50 We're a post-in house.
01:58:52 We're a post-in family.
01:58:53 We post in this house.
01:58:54 In this house, we post.
01:58:56 And if you're not posting, then you don't live here anymore.
01:59:02 Yeah, damn.
01:59:05 Podcasting sure is cringe.
01:59:09 Long.
01:59:09 Continues podcasting.
01:59:11 Here we go.
01:59:12 He's, he said on his podcast, he said with his latte, with his soy latte,
01:59:18 he's paid $8 for his Starbucks soy latte, but he won't pay $8 for his blue checkmark.
01:59:27 I haven't seen anyone with a blue checkmark in a long time.
01:59:30 I guess I don't see them that much anyway, but.
01:59:33 I see them, I see them around sometimes.
01:59:37 And it's always, it's always cringe.
01:59:39 Honestly, the worst is when I see someone that makes a post that I agree with and I check
01:59:43 and they've got a blue checkmark and I'm like, oh God.
01:59:45 Did they have that before the paid thing though?
01:59:50 No, there's no way to know.
01:59:51 No, there is a way to know.
01:59:52 You can, you can, if you hover over the checkmark on their profile,
01:59:56 it'll tell you whether they have it because they're notable or if they just bought it.
02:00:01 So you can see.
02:00:02 And whenever it's someone that bought it, I'm just like, well,
02:00:05 I might agree with your opinion on this particular issue.
02:00:08 But like, I'm not, you're, you're DNI.
02:00:12 You do not interact.
02:00:13 You're, you're dead, I'm sorry.
02:00:16 I'm sorry, we can't be friends.
02:00:21 That's just how, that's the way the news goes.
02:00:24 That's the way the big news goes.
02:00:26 Big news, Morgan.
02:00:27 What a, what a dude.
02:00:31 Yes.
02:00:32 Want to see more of him.
02:00:35 I'm sure we will.
02:00:36 He's, he's, he's the news.
02:00:40 That's the way the news goes, as he says.
02:00:43 His famous catchphrase.
02:00:48 All right.
02:00:49 Well, what do you think?
02:00:50 Voice mail time?
02:00:53 Yeah.
02:00:54 All right.
02:00:56 Well, let's do it.
02:00:59 I'm looking at and I'm seeing that the first voicemail of the week is called.
02:01:03 Wow.
02:01:04 You see it?
02:01:06 Yep.
02:01:07 Do you see it?
02:01:08 Okay.
02:01:09 Well, let's, let's hope that my internet is better this week than last week.
02:01:13 Lol.
02:01:13 Okay.
02:01:14 Three, two, one, go.
02:01:16 Ben, by the time I was, I'm sending these, it's a hundred thousand.
02:01:23 Good job.
02:01:23 You did it.
02:01:24 Oh.
02:01:25 High five.
02:01:26 Yeah.
02:01:28 Did you, did you high five me?
02:01:31 This was sent a week ago.
02:01:33 Yeah.
02:01:33 The video made a hundred K in just under a week.
02:01:39 And now at the two, it had, it was like, it was at like 200 and like 30 something K
02:01:44 at the two week mark.
02:01:46 So thanks, thanks.
02:01:50 You know, it's very refreshing.
02:01:53 I have had a couple people finding, find me through the Mega Man lecture
02:01:58 and they, and they don't know what the PCP is.
02:02:01 They don't know about Sonichu.
02:02:03 They don't know any of the horrors.
02:02:07 They're free.
02:02:08 Yes.
02:02:08 Their minds are clean and pure.
02:02:11 They don't know about Digi Bro.
02:02:13 They don't know about my little pony.
02:02:17 Imagine being someone like that.
02:02:19 It's so refreshing.
02:02:20 I can't, I can't.
02:02:21 I have to live through them.
02:02:24 The next one is called clicking a pen.
02:02:26 Three, two, one, go.
02:02:30 So I just saw that Mega Man video.
02:02:33 True.
02:02:34 And at the 12 minute marker.
02:02:37 So you say, hang on, I'm thirsty.
02:02:41 And that was pretty funny.
02:02:42 Thanks.
02:02:43 That made me laugh, made me laugh really hard for like a minute.
02:02:46 Thank you very much.
02:02:48 I liked when I said I'm thirsty.
02:02:49 Anyways, that's not the point.
02:02:51 I was just going to say, I like the video, but when's the Mega Man battle network
02:02:56 one coming out?
02:02:57 Probably will do one.
02:02:58 I probably will do that at some point.
02:03:00 It'll be a good companion piece.
02:03:03 Yeah, I think I might have said this, but I think I do want to do it.
02:03:08 I should do it and I want to do it.
02:03:10 I don't want to do it right away.
02:03:12 I feel like I've had enough Mega Man for the moment.
02:03:16 For the Mega Moment.
02:03:17 For the Mega, for the Mega Moment.
02:03:19 I kind of don't want to like play more video games right now.
02:03:23 I'm going to do something else.
02:03:24 I just released, I just released a damn
02:03:30 Patron's Q&A podcast where I talk about
02:03:34 what I'm going to do for the next lecture and other stuff.
02:03:38 So, um, actually some of it might be a repeat of what I talked about here on last week,
02:03:44 but don't think about that.
02:03:46 Don't, don't worry about that.
02:03:49 Next one is called It's a Good Idea.
02:03:50 I stand by it.
02:03:51 Three, two, one, go.
02:03:53 All right, Ben, your Mega Man lecture is finally out
02:03:56 and I think it is time for you to move on to your next, uh, large project.
02:04:03 And I think I've got a great idea for you.
02:04:05 Here's my pitch.
02:04:06 Here's my pitch for the next months long arc of the, uh, the life of Ben St.
02:04:12 I know, I know.
02:04:13 Here we go.
02:04:14 My big idea is you should fuck Jenny Nicholson.
02:04:19 Hmm.
02:04:20 Think about it.
02:04:21 Make a video.
02:04:22 Make a video out of it.
02:04:24 That's an idea.
02:04:27 You know, maybe there's something, you know, you know, it sounds crazy, but I mean,
02:04:33 it just might work.
02:04:34 You, she can make a video about it.
02:04:36 You could both make content out of that.
02:04:37 I could make a video about it.
02:04:39 She could make a video about it.
02:04:40 We could review it.
02:04:43 Hey, Jenny Nicholson, what are you doing in my review of sex with you?
02:04:54 Yeah, I'm all right.
02:04:56 I'll put it on the maybe list.
02:05:00 Now that's content.
02:05:04 Oh, dude, I gotta kick out of that.
02:05:09 X1 is called right now.
02:05:13 Three, two, one, go.
02:05:16 Ben, now make your brand in your catchphrase whenever you finish a sentence.
02:05:22 Say, huh, maybe I should make a lecture about that.
02:05:27 Everyone will love it.
02:05:29 Your fan base will triplicate.
02:05:32 Triplicate.
02:05:34 My fan base will triplicate.
02:05:37 It's like a Japanese, one of those anime character, like they end a sentence with a
02:05:41 nyon or a nyodon or something, or they end it with a pya.
02:05:45 But for me, it's maybe I should make a lecture about that.
02:05:48 I could roll off the tongue pretty well.
02:05:52 I'll workshop it.
02:05:54 Motivate, and I end every sentence with a till day, till day lecture.
02:06:00 What do you think?
02:06:01 Till day?
02:06:03 Yeah, you know, till day, the squiggly line.
02:06:07 I always pronounce it tilde.
02:06:09 Oh, whatever.
02:06:11 Stupid, stupid.
02:06:16 Never mind.
02:06:16 It's just like tilde swinton.
02:06:22 Yeah, yeah, that's how you spell it.
02:06:27 It's no, it's not.
02:06:29 No.
02:06:31 Yeah, it's like, no, it's like e.
02:06:35 It's an e.
02:06:36 It's till day.
02:06:37 It's tilde swinton.
02:06:40 Oh, yeah.
02:06:42 Oh, I see.
02:06:43 Mm, swinton, I end my sentences with...
02:06:50 What was that?
02:06:54 Well, okay.
02:06:56 Next one is called, we'll see.
02:06:59 There's congrats on the video ban, congrats on 69k ban, congrats on 100k ban, congrats on 169
02:07:06 ban, congrats on 200k ban.
02:07:08 Haven't hit 269 yet, so I look forward to that.
02:07:13 Congratulations.
02:07:14 Next one is, is lecture better than video essay?
02:07:18 Question mark, three, two, one, go.
02:07:21 Yo, so I'm listening to episode 337 right now, where Ben is like talking about all the topics for
02:07:29 potential lectures.
02:07:32 And I feel like, yeah, some of these aren't great lecture topics, but I think some of them
02:07:40 would just be nice and short concise, like regular ass YouTube video essays, I don't know.
02:07:47 If there's something that Ben just doesn't want to do, I would like to know.
02:07:56 I think I said something similar in the, my Patreon post where I talked about this, like,
02:08:03 yeah, some of those things, yeah, would not make for a great lecture.
02:08:08 Like, I think in particular I said the one about phantom horn, like, discussing phantom
02:08:11 horn as a character, like, that's not lecture worthy.
02:08:14 I could make a video about it.
02:08:16 I don't know, to be perfectly honest, I'm very out of practice at, like, writing essays,
02:08:24 but I think it's something that I would like to pick up and try doing again.
02:08:30 So maybe I would just try and, like, write a video essay about something like that, that I
02:08:34 want to talk about, but that I don't have, like, a lecture on.
02:08:39 The lecture format, for me, is a bit of a, it's sort of a bit of a, it's sort of a bit of a, like,
02:08:51 I don't know, it's kind of a way to, like, get content out of, like, speaking off the cuff
02:08:57 in, like, a structured way, but that I don't have to, like, prescript and read off of a script about.
02:09:04 I always feel like my, my voice is so weird and stupid when I'm speaking off a script,
02:09:12 compared to, like, speaking off the cuff, it's just sort of like I'm saying something,
02:09:16 and I say it in the way I normally talk, so it's like, it's flows.
02:09:20 When I write a script, I'm not really writing the way I would speak unless I try to.
02:09:26 I, I feel that as well.
02:09:29 I feel like, yeah, like, my writing voice is different from my speaking voice,
02:09:34 and I guess I don't, like, I don't really do scripted content, and wait a minute.
02:09:43 I feel like, am I getting deja vu? Was I talking earlier this episode about, like, how, like,
02:09:52 did I, did I say something earlier this episode about, like, oh, but if I did
02:09:56 that, if I did something, like, would, like, would people still accept me or something?
02:10:02 Am I crazy? Do I have a nightmare? Do I have a waking nightmare?
02:10:06 What you're talking about?
02:10:07 I don't know. I feel, I feel a sense of deja vu, like, I said this already, but anyway,
02:10:10 what I'm trying to say is that, uh, uh, yeah, I feel like I wonder, like,
02:10:15 would I, would, would it be annoying? Would I, would I sound annoying? Like, either my,
02:10:19 my writing voice as in, like, the way that I structure my senses is stuff when I write,
02:10:23 or my delivery, reading on a script. When I, when I hear myself reading off of a script,
02:10:28 it feels awkward and stilted to me, and I wonder if others feel the same way about it, or is it
02:10:34 just that it feels weird to me because I'm not used to hearing myself talk like that?
02:10:40 Um, it could just be you. I mean, I feel that way about my script-speaking voice, and you know
02:10:47 what my videos sound like. I assume you remember, like, hypocrite videos don't sound like how I speak
02:10:54 or whatever. A little, a little different. There's a little difference. It's like,
02:11:00 I mean, I sometimes- The cadence is a little bit, yeah. A little bit different, yeah.
02:11:04 But you don't think it's like terrible. You just think it's different.
02:11:08 Yeah. I think that probably other people would not think that it sounds as weird as I think it
02:11:16 sounds when I hear myself speaking like that. To me, it sounds unnatural, but also like reading,
02:11:24 reading scripted content is like, that's like most of what people say on, well, that's not true,
02:11:30 because in video, in the video essay genre, like, that's the standard for video essays,
02:11:36 and like, nobody thinks it's weird. So, I don't know. I feel like I should try it. I feel like I
02:11:43 should try, like, yeah, write an essay, read it as a video essay, because I never really did that.
02:11:47 I did the closest thing I did were the rambles and the Winnie the Pooh videos, but those were not
02:11:52 scripted. Those were like, yeah, I was reading off of notes. I was sort of speaking off the cuff,
02:11:56 going off of notes that I wrote. I should at some point try to write a script and deliver it
02:12:02 in script and just see if it sucks or not. Yeah. There's no, like, correct way to do it.
02:12:08 It just whatever ends up being good. Like, I feel like I, unfortunately, I'm not good at
02:12:16 remembering things and keeping on track. So, if I go off the cuff, I need to do a lot of editing
02:12:21 afterwards to make it flow good, but I sound better and more fun when I'm off the cuff,
02:12:28 and I can do more funny bits in between points. I think, yeah, I think that, like,
02:12:36 the Mega Man lecture, the way that I delivered it off the cuff, but then I, like, cutting it down
02:12:40 into, like, only, like, the parts where I'm, like, speaking animatedly, and I'm, like,
02:12:46 no pauses, no, like, um, um, um. I really think that that captures a lot of, like,
02:12:53 energy. I really think that makes it a pretty engaging watch. So, I think it worked well.
02:13:00 And that's the same thing. I mean, they did the same thing in the ones that I said,
02:13:04 in the, the, the, the carry can read video and the Mike's Mike video. That's exactly what they
02:13:08 did in those. And I think it worked similarly. So, I think it's a good formula. It's not the only
02:13:15 formula. And I might try, yeah, for some of those other topics, maybe if I want to make that Phantom
02:13:22 Horn video, I might make it as a more traditional YouTube video essay. Yeah. That's a good question,
02:13:28 though. Good question.
02:13:29 As a quick, a quick aside, what do you think of long video essays, you know, just sort of a long
02:13:38 video essay that has, like, a lengthy, like, musical intro where it tries to be super epic,
02:13:44 and there are, like, titles and stuff? Because I don't like those. I want-
02:13:49 Are there?
02:13:50 I, I, I feel like you can have, like, a flashy video essay documentary or whatever.
02:13:57 But I want to get to the point immediately. I don't like it when there's, like, this implied,
02:14:04 like, reverence for a video I haven't even seen on, and I don't even know if it's good yet.
02:14:10 Can you get, I can think of one or two examples. I mean, the, well, the only thing that jumps
02:14:15 from, some of the action button reviews kind of have that a little bit.
02:14:19 There, there's, it was just sort of, like, I felt very strongly about it when I saw people on
02:14:25 Twitter talking about this specific video. I can't remember what it was about. And they said,
02:14:29 oh, it's so good. It's such a really good video. And I click on it and I'm like, okay,
02:14:34 lay it on me. And it's just sort of, like, slow and, like, epic. And they're not saying anything
02:14:42 yet. And I'm like, okay, this is the big intro for your, like, three hour long video.
02:14:47 You don't remember what the video was?
02:14:48 I didn't watch it because it was like, I was annoyed by the intro and I left.
02:14:53 Do you remember what it was called or who made it or what channel it was on?
02:14:57 No, it was just sort of a passing encounter with, you know, one of those types of videos. I'm like,
02:15:04 I understand that if you know what the video is about and you care about,
02:15:08 like, if you are making it, you know that it's going to be epic. But like,
02:15:11 I don't know that. I'm just some random person. I see it and I'm like, I get bored immediately.
02:15:16 Action button is the only example I can think of like that, to be honest.
02:15:23 All you really need is a good immediate thing, like summoning salt.
02:15:27 And they're not all like that.
02:15:28 Summoning salts, like video essays about speedrunning. I do, I mean, the formula is pretty
02:15:34 done for me at this point. I don't really care about speedrun world record,
02:15:40 like recaps. They're pretty cool still. But the way he structures the videos has always been good
02:15:45 is that he gets you like he gets the big point off immediately. Then there's the music and then
02:15:52 he goes into like the big the intro. Well, like it's a little bit beginning.
02:15:57 I'm not complaining. It's a little bit like high school essay, the way that he structures them.
02:16:04 Like it's not a problem. It's fine. You know, if it don't if it work, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
02:16:11 But it's a little bit like, since the dawn of time, mankind has wondered how fast can you beat
02:16:17 Mario 64? Today, we will explore the answer. Music plays okay, and then we're in. Like that's the
02:16:23 intro paragraph. Yeah, like it's like it's fine. It's serviceable. I wouldn't say he's like the
02:16:31 best one of it. It's just the first one that comes to my head is like somebody who gives you the
02:16:35 initial what is this video about immediately and then has its intro and then the explanation follows.
02:16:44 I mean, the first few times, I was like, oh, cool. I don't know anything about speed running,
02:16:52 and it's so handy that there is a video that's going to teach me about it. Because like that's
02:16:59 it's hard to at the time he was like blowing up kind of wasn't like a big community around
02:17:06 speedrun, archiving and talking about at least not I mean, it's it's gotten bigger. It's gotten
02:17:11 bigger, like because of him. I mean, maybe maybe it would have anyway. But yeah. Yeah,
02:17:18 there may be were people already doing it, but I just never saw them.
02:17:22 No, he definitely was that like at the forefront of the like, Hey, what if I made videos explaining
02:17:28 speed running? And it's like, it's good content. It's a good formula. It's the kind of video
02:17:36 that like, I can if they make more of them, like I'll watch them because like it's good stuff to
02:17:42 just put on to like, sort of pay attention to the reason I say the formula has gotten old for me
02:17:49 or I'm done with it is just I think a lot of the same tropes are used in the way of telling the
02:17:58 story. Like you've got this character, this gamer who's doing these things. And then suddenly,
02:18:03 somebody found like, this was how the low the record got. But then you discover this gift
02:18:09 that saved a minute. And then people did it. And then there was this new runner and it's like
02:18:14 and then that same guy from before also did it. And then another challenger came. It's pretty
02:18:20 simple, like the beats of the story, regardless of the game, regardless of anything, the whole point
02:18:26 is that it gets the patterns, the patterns, the patterns emerge. Yeah, the pattern, you start
02:18:32 to see the code behind the matrix a little bit, I get you. And so I'm more interested in games
02:18:36 that I care about and know about than just, I don't know, Mario Kart Wii.
02:18:45 I okay, I know that you haven't seen these, but man, I got a little annoyed.
02:18:54 Because I made, I made some pretty mild criticism of Tim Rogers action button on Twitter yesterday.
02:19:01 And not everyone, you know, some people disagreed with me and that's fine. A couple of people got
02:19:07 really mad and like, were really like angry and defensive and accusatory towards me
02:19:15 for like really, really gentle criticism that I made. Like, basically, I literally just said
02:19:20 that one of his videos was better than a different one of his video. Yeah, I saw the tweet. How mad
02:19:26 were they? I don't, well, one guy saying so much. One guy told me I should die mad. And then he said
02:19:32 that I was accusing Tim of faking a disability, which I was not. People, people said, some people
02:19:41 said I was just projecting. Some people said I was a hypocrite because, yeah.
02:19:47 I don't know. I didn't like it. I really didn't like that attitude. I said that in my, I just said,
02:19:59 I said that the, I didn't like, I didn't really like, I mean, I like the Bokunopiko, not Bokunopiko,
02:20:05 the book, sorry, the Bokunonatsuyasumi video. I enjoyed it. I thought that the vacation
02:20:11 diversion was a bit longer than it needed to be. I kind of don't like, I sort of, I sort of have
02:20:18 the same criticism of the Tokimeki, I like the Tokimeki Memorial video. It feels more unique.
02:20:23 It feels more original. It feels to me like the Bokunonatsuyasumi video was sort of kind of trying
02:20:29 to do the same thing again. And I'm like, okay, this doesn't feel as unique. This doesn't feel
02:20:34 special the second time. And then the, I don't know. That's it. That's it. I like the first one
02:20:48 better because I feel like it was, it's the original version. And like, I don't know, man, I'm sorry.
02:20:57 I don't even know where I was going with that. I like those videos. They're good.
02:21:02 I'm deeply suspicious of Tim as a person, but like whatever, that's neither here nor there.
02:21:09 Why are you suspicious? I don't know. I don't like how self aggrandizing, he's self aggrandizing,
02:21:15 but it's in like a stealth way that I feel like, I'm, I feel like I'm going crazy because I feel
02:21:21 like I'm the only one that notices it. It feels like everyone thinks that Tim is like a very like
02:21:27 self deprecating, self effacing, humble guy. And I think that's like a trick that people are
02:21:36 falling for. Like, I think he's humble bragging, but he's doing it in a very like,
02:21:41 he's doing it in a very effective way that people are genuinely falling for it. And that makes me
02:21:44 uneasy. I haven't watched any of his stuff, but the only impression I've gotten of him
02:21:51 through people talking about how cool his videos are is that there's a lot of parasocial stuff going
02:21:56 on. And maybe his videos are good, but they love him when they talk about him.
02:22:02 Yeah. I mean, I would have agreed with that before, but like now seeing, seeing like,
02:22:09 you know, this was just a couple of people, but seeing like a couple people get genuinely outraged
02:22:15 with me over my mild take. It's like these, I don't know. I don't know. I really, all right,
02:22:24 I feel, I feel this way about Tokimeki Memorial and the Boku no Naziasmi videos.
02:22:30 Both of them lean a little too hard into they basically are about Tim. They are more about
02:22:36 Tim than they are about the video, the game. And that's not a sin. That's not a crime. However,
02:22:43 I don't like it. It reminds me. I don't know. I don't, I don't like when I get that feeling
02:22:49 about a video, I feel dirty. And Tokimeki Memorial and Boku no Naziasmi both give me
02:22:54 that feeling a little bit. Like the point here is for Tim to talk about himself. And that makes
02:22:59 me like gives me a yucky feeling. And then I don't know. I think he talks about himself in a way
02:23:08 that evokes pity while at the same time aggrandizes and mythologizes himself. And
02:23:20 I don't know. Yeah, it feels almost calculate, it feels calculated to evoke
02:23:25 a certain level of devotion of like protectiveness and parasocial devotion. And I feel like that's
02:23:32 what I witnessed yesterday from a couple of these people. And it has, it reinforced,
02:23:38 it reinforced a sort of a sort of creeping sense, a sort of vague feeling that I had about him
02:23:45 has been validated somewhat a bit. Right? Yeah, I mean, maybe, I feel like, I mean,
02:23:54 the reason I said parasocial was mostly because I didn't know what the appeal was. And nobody would
02:24:00 tell me. They would just say they're so good. They're so good at these videos. I'm like,
02:24:05 but like, why though? Well, I mean, he talks, I mean, he is an interesting guy. And he does
02:24:15 have interesting stories about his life. And like he's he worked in the gaming industry. And he has
02:24:21 genuinely interesting anecdotes to tell about like workplace conversations he had with like
02:24:26 Sony executives and like things that like, you know, people you've heard of like Suda,
02:24:32 like told him in person, supposedly, he, you know, has a lot of insight into the gaming industry.
02:24:42 He has a lot of opinions and he's met people you've heard of like American Johnson.
02:24:48 And he ties a lot of his talk about the game into like stuff about his childhood and like
02:24:57 growing up and like how his school, his, you know, how like one of his older classmates was
02:25:04 Subway Jared. I think his older brother was like friends with Subway Jared for a little while.
02:25:13 Uh, somebody burned down his high school gymnasium when he was like a high schooler. And that's a
02:25:19 whole thing. And he ties that the news hysteria around that he taught uses that to segue into
02:25:23 talking about like the news reporting on video game violence. So you know, he gives a lot of he
02:25:31 gives a lot of very, he gives a lot of very insightful analysis of the game and insight
02:25:36 into the industry and the people in it and the culture around it. And you know, that's all great.
02:25:41 Okay. And then the Tokimaki, the Tokimaki Memorial one and the Boku no Natsuyasumi one
02:25:46 are very much where he sort of take talks about the game in a way that he sort of opines about
02:25:50 like his childhood, his, his, his experience growing up, his experience with like, you know,
02:25:57 anime and gaming and culture and all that stuff and gets really emotional at times. And like, you
02:26:04 know, I, I enjoy it. I enjoyed those videos. They're good. And I just said that like, and I
02:26:13 just said that one, I just like the, I just like the first, I just like the first time he did it
02:26:16 better, you know, I got the sense that because the Tokimaki Memorial one was the one that got big,
02:26:23 and it was, that's the one that I found first. And it's the one that got the most views. And
02:26:27 it's the one that kind of blew up the channel a bit. I feel like, I feel like he tried to do it
02:26:33 again. He once again, he took a, like a social simulator game and he waxes very, waxes philosophical
02:26:42 about it. He gets nostalgic for his childhood. He goes on a whole, he goes on, goes to visit his
02:26:47 old school and he talks about like teachers he knew when he was a kid and stuff. And you know,
02:26:52 that's fine. I just kind of feel like he did it, he already did it a little bit.
02:26:58 Okay. That's my, that's my, that's my action button rant.
02:27:05 Action butt on. Yeah, more like action butt is how I would summarize my opinion.
02:27:13 Yeah, he seems all right, I guess. He's fine. He's fine. I don't, I don't, I don't begrudge him.
02:27:18 I don't begrudge him any of this. I get it. It just sort of, I guess I'm like averse to
02:27:25 parasocial, like, like getting to know a person. I know it's not unique to him, but like that seems
02:27:32 to be when, when people talk about him, that seems to be a lot of the appeal is that he talks
02:27:38 about himself and he's interesting. And I'm like, I don't want another parasocial person. I don't
02:27:43 want, I don't want that. I don't want to care about another like e-famous person anymore.
02:27:48 I get that. I get that. He is interesting, but also I, he does lean into the,
02:27:56 it's kind of every YouTuber, to a certain extent every, the point of every YouTuber is to talk
02:28:01 about, is actually to talk about myself. I'm here ostensibly to discuss a topic, but really the
02:28:06 point is that I want to talk about myself and make you love me. And Tim is very much that.
02:28:11 It's not like Tim is like egregious. It's just, it's just that I don't go in wanting
02:28:20 like to know people. I care about videos and if they're good, I'll eventually get to know them
02:28:25 anyway. I understand. I feel you. I feel you. I mean, I do think they're good videos. At the end,
02:28:35 at the end of the day, I have to concede they're entertaining.
02:28:38 What's your, what do you think is his best video? I'll watch that.
02:28:42 I would probably say, I guess I would probably say the Tokimeki Memorial one.
02:28:48 Okay. I mean, the Boku no Natsuyasumi one is good.
02:28:53 You've got to watch the Boku no Pika one.
02:28:56 I mean, I mean, the other ones, those two are more about, are even more about him than the others.
02:29:04 I mean, he talks about himself in every video, like that's a given. Those ones are like especially
02:29:10 like that in the ones like about Pac-Man, the Pac-Man one and the Doom one, I would say like
02:29:16 focus more on the game, the culture around the game and stuff. Yes, it's not like I dislike
02:29:24 YouTube's talking about themselves. I don't know. I feel like that's kind of why I stopped watching
02:29:29 ContraPoints and why I stopped watching Philosophy Tube is because I felt like
02:29:33 it felt a little, it made me a little sick that like, these channels have kind of become about
02:29:38 the person that's making them. A little bit. Not really about philosophy.
02:29:43 I mean, Philosophy Tube had recently a good video about the NHS and how fucked it is with
02:29:52 regards to treating trans women or trans people in general, which was very relevant to me. So,
02:29:57 that was a good one. Sure. Yeah, very personal. ContraPoints hasn't made a video in a while.
02:30:05 No, but her last one. What did she do? I didn't remember. The last one was the one about
02:30:11 Void, the drug, the stuff that you drip into the water. Yeah. And like it was fine. I didn't hate it,
02:30:18 but I was like, this is just a video about how you're struggling with addiction and like,
02:30:23 best of luck. It's a short film. Best of luck with that, but...
02:30:27 It was a nice short film about herself, and that's okay. I guess I'm just not interested in those.
02:30:35 Okay. Yeah, I think we're on the same page. Right. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I have this.
02:30:47 This is something that I feel about many content creators on the web.
02:30:53 I guess it's sort of a thing that I feel about celebrity in general,
02:30:58 is that it's evil. Is that it's evil and bad, and anyone who engages in it in any way should be
02:31:06 cast into the lake of fire. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, if the videos are
02:31:12 good, if the reason they're known, like the stuff they make is good, regardless of like
02:31:18 parasocial stuff. I guess I don't mind. I guess I don't mind being wrapped up in it.
02:31:23 Well, let me... If it works for me. Let me... What did he do? He did the Cyberpunk 2027 one. That one's
02:31:30 like... That one's really big. It's... That one's like... That one's too big. That one's too big.
