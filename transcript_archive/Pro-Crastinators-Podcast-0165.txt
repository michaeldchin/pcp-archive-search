00:00:00 You appear to have caught me by surprise, hello I'm Dan Huxable and I'm taking over this
00:00:10 channel. Unfortunately the first 20 minutes of my audio was lost because although many
00:00:20 things are very good, nothing is perfect. My new laptop for some reason wasn't recording
00:00:25 the audio. So I'm going to improvise as I'm often known to do. Enjoy the show.
00:00:55 I don't think illustrious is the apt word to describe him. I'm more of a shadowy, shrouded
00:01:12 in a fog. A mist shroud. The barely perceptible Ben Saint. Just the way I like it honestly.
00:01:21 We're talking about Pokemon this episode. New Pokemon, absolute garbage. Let's talk
00:01:29 about communism. There's no new Pokemon. They're all gone. All Pokemon are gone. There's no
00:01:37 more for anyone. It's a Poppers Pokemon thing. Who cares? I was in London today. I met with
00:01:47 LeMantart who is a person you may know from RFCK and General Discord stuff. He's going
00:01:54 to be there at RFCKCon London. Let's talk about that a little bit. Why did you meet
00:02:00 him? What were you guys just saying? He just landed this morning. Yeah, I was just to say
00:02:06 hi. So he actually flew in for this? He's from Spain. I met him in Madrid when I went
00:02:14 to Madrid. He's in London for a work thing. It's perfect timing for him to be at RFCKCon.
00:02:23 Assuming he can get that one day, that day off. I just met up with him and it was nice.
00:02:29 London is really big. Oh, that's great. That makes me happy. I understand this might be
00:02:34 like a cliche and make sound like something that I say and it's fake and meant to get
00:02:39 your eyeballs on to me and rub your juices all over my sinful, sinful corpse. But genuinely,
00:02:47 I actually like meeting fans because kind of inexplicably is the newest Pokemon that
00:02:55 was just announced. You know what? That's a great name. Anyway, they're all like cool.
00:03:01 RFCKCon is like only people who I genuinely like and would genuinely consider my friend.
00:03:07 AJ Shoop and Connor and Paradox Crux. People like that literally just like them. Here's
00:03:12 why. Because in order to be into RFCK at all, there's a certain threshold of general personhood
00:03:18 competence you have to rise above as well as commitment to the organization of RFCK.
00:03:24 That is a perfect segue. I should just say that Potat was also there. I didn't mention him
00:03:30 because RFCK people may not know Potat. I know Potat from the PPP, the PPKP. Yes, we talked
00:03:42 about that a little. Oh, wait, who is it? I don't remember. The Potat PAPES Kevin podcast.
00:03:48 Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. I know Potat from sounding vaguely similar to Tadpo. Anyway,
00:03:54 I was going to say, actually, it sounds more like Lotat, who we all famously met at that one
00:03:58 RFCK meetup. Stop talking about Pokemon. Stop even trying. Lotat tweeted at us. No,
00:04:04 no, Nate's actually the real fan in the scenario because I can't believe you would remember that
00:04:09 occasion at RFCK. It was a legendary moment. Lotat was so honored that we would acknowledge his
00:04:13 existence. Wait, it was great. Anyway, I want to talk about how I- You mean the Lotat? Yes,
00:04:18 the Lotat Twitter. In the flesh? In the flesh. Obviously, I wanted to get more people going
00:04:25 to specifically the London meetup because I feel it's like a PCP London meetup, a PCP
00:04:32 adjacent meetup. That doesn't happen a lot in Europe. That's a rare beast. I feel like it would
00:04:39 get people a little bit mad that they did not know this was happening. I thought it would just
00:04:43 be a nice gesture to post on the PCP that that was happening, the London comm was happening.
00:04:48 And so I decided to denounce the other ones as well, Baltimore and San Diego. And so I do that.
00:04:53 And then income flooding the PCP heads into the RFCK meetup. And I knew this would happen,
00:05:00 but the rate and the ferocity that which it did was simply like, I can't describe it in another
00:05:06 way than disgusting. Let me describe literally every single PCP fan to you. They're an anime avatar,
00:05:13 they're smug, and they think it's okay to be mean for no reason and just like just viciously bizarre.
00:05:20 So they're just coming here with no personality and no tact and no just like willpower. They are
00:05:26 pure leaders, not followers and their role play skills infantile, frankly. When you see
00:05:35 a PCP fan next to an RFCK fan, the PCP fan with their just some random anime bitch, no personality,
00:05:44 versus the level 100 boss, literally, yes. And then you and then you look just one thing over
00:05:49 to a frame, the paragon of RFCK culture with his completely original art avatar made for his
00:05:57 character, depicting a moment in RFCK in the game that happened in real life. It's not,
00:06:03 it's not a lifestyle, a noteworthy person as opposed to, you know, just an average RFCK,
00:06:09 you know. It's imbued with spirit. This has so much lore and context and history and culture
00:06:14 just imbued into this one aspect of his avatar where the PCP fans have literally never known
00:06:20 culture or history in their entire lives. It's because there's, there actually, there is a
00:06:24 barrier of entry to PCP stuff, but it is far lower than RFCK stuff. And that's why it doesn't
00:06:30 weed out the chat. Well, it's because PCP fans are all named DigiHeads, aka like I can't imagine
00:06:35 it in words fate. That's funny because PCP is like there's, it's so niche. It's so niche already.
00:06:41 It is. It is. RFCK is like niche within that. But you need to go even niche here. That's the way
00:06:46 to the, to heaven. Yeah. Anyway, I'm trying to pacify them and civilize them at the same time.
00:06:53 I'm just like continuously spamming the invite link to the main server in this meetup side
00:06:59 server that I created for the meetups. And so I'm going to try and save them. I mean,
00:07:04 I think it's a long shot. I think, I think they're going to reject it. I think they're going to be
00:07:07 like, what's the text command? It's way too hard. What's reading? Oh God, it's way, there's way too
00:07:13 much personality here. Please take me back. You sound like an actual cult leader. The only way to
00:07:18 save these people is to get them into RFCK and civilize them. Literally, yes. That's what I believe,
00:07:23 Nate. That's what I believe. Please just read my text. Read my Bible. It's way better than the
00:07:32 real Bible because it's got a little bit of a slimy touch to it. Just a little bit. We should
00:07:39 actually write one. We should actually just write one. There's a newspaper, right? But maybe those
00:07:44 people could be reappropriated to write an actual one. Or maybe the PCP should write one. You know,
00:07:47 I was reading, my friend John lent me this book called the, The Chapo Guide to Revolution
00:07:55 by the Chapo Trap House, which is another sort of podcasty collective, not entirely
00:08:01 dissimilar from us, but vastly more successful. Impossible. You can call getting into politics
00:08:09 success. Nate, you of all people cannot say that, die. Would you call making money success?
00:08:19 No. Okay, well, I guess. Who are you and what have you done to Nate? Yeah, yeah, yeah, Tom.
00:08:26 Nate said lying through his teeth. Yeah, yeah.
00:08:30 Nice. That's all I have to say about that, I guess. Did you read it? Did you like it?
00:08:34 I am reading it now. So far, it is a little bit too world history-y for me to get it. I'm a little
00:08:42 too dumb. You stabbed me. You stabbed me. I'm not, I'm not, Ben's no history buddy. I'm saying,
00:08:48 I'm saying this as a like, I am ashamed of myself. You know what, you know, that's fine. You know,
00:08:54 you know how it's like funny and like quirky to say online, like, oh, I'm so like bad at math,
00:08:58 or at least it was in like early 2010s. Yeah, no, I'm not trying to be like, I don't know any
00:09:02 this world history. It's like, oh man, like now I wish I knew more about world history so I could
00:09:08 laugh at these jokes. Yeah, I feel that. You know what? It's wasted on, it's pearls before swine.
00:09:14 It's, it's just anime. Absolutely true. It's just anime. I've said this a long time, but it's just
00:09:19 anime. I mean, I know what the war on terror is in theory. But do I experience it day to day? Do I
00:09:28 participate? Did I live it? Do I facilitate? Do I facilitate it? Yes. Do I continue to vote? Absolutely.
00:09:34 But if you walk outside, you saw Modica Magica anime girl right there and like in the flesh.
00:09:40 It's like that. Hey, you're ready for a hard left turn. Here's a hard left turn. So I bear the singular
00:09:47 distinction of being the first PCP individual to acquire the legendary silver play button,
00:09:52 which I now have. You've got it. I have it. Yeah, it was in my, I showed it off in my,
00:09:57 my last video of me a math of a two. Digi should have rightfully gotten his, but just years and
00:10:02 years ago. Absolutely. But, but the thing is Digi is so incompetent at life and such a hack
00:10:08 fraud at basic organizational skills that he has not put his two brain cells have not collided
00:10:14 to produce in the production and speaking to the, uh, actually, you know who helped me out. I
00:10:18 didn't know how to get it. I talked to, um, uh, the gaming Brit and he was just like, yeah,
00:10:22 just message these guys. And I was like, Oh, okay. I did instantly solved and they got it rolling
00:10:26 immediately. Sounds, sounds, sounds about right. I'm all, I'm all for trophies and knickknacks and
00:10:31 just things to put around your house and just have clutter to just, you know, seize up your brain
00:10:35 and make you unable to function whatsoever. I'm going to hang out next to my diploma from school.
00:10:40 I mean, the diploma is far more impressive, but, you know,
00:10:42 I'm down for stuff like that. Oh, yeah. Do you like it? Do you like it?
00:10:46 Anybody can get a fucking diploma. Anybody can get a diploma. It takes work to get a hundred
00:10:50 thousand subscribers. You know, that's actually an interesting one's one's an accomplished more
00:10:55 impressive because like, I mean, just for example, look at the case of the, of the, the furtive Si.
00:11:01 Si is not, you know, he actually was pretty successful on YouTube for a while. But like,
00:11:05 but the question is like, what did it turn into long term? Because it wasn't like sustainable,
00:11:10 but he did get the play button. So as opposed to like a degree, a degree is something tangible
00:11:14 that you can have forever and used to to apply for jobs. Are you talking about Si all the time on
00:11:20 this show? This is something that if your diploma is something that if all goes according to plan,
00:11:27 you will never need again. Well, that is true. That is true. Then we can't hear you if you're
00:11:32 talking right now, if you're saying something. Yeah, you're dead. I don't hear a thing from Zen.
00:11:37 Having some audio. Maybe try rejoining or something. Oh, no. I don't know. No, no.
00:11:41 We have not even the last couple of minutes, at least for the past 10 minutes. I don't know.
00:11:45 Try restarting Discord, dude. Try. Doesn't make any sense. He introduced the episode and then
00:11:50 died. Is it just your mic? Is it recording into audacity correctly or something?
00:11:55 I don't know.
00:11:57 Is that dance text status or that damn voice status?
00:12:03 I guess restart your computer. I don't know. That's all I got. Delete your computer. Delete
00:12:09 your account. Discord complications. Delete system 32.
00:12:16 We're all docked up and ready to go. Hey, here's here's a fun fact. What's up,
00:12:20 Tony? The PCP has been getting just so fucked with demonetization recently,
00:12:26 that it simply was not the case up until very recently. But now I'm used to every episode.
00:12:32 Add Pocalypse too, baby. I mean, maybe. I'm used to every episode initially
00:12:37 getting said it's going to be demonetized. And then I do an appeal and they say, oh,
00:12:43 that's actually, you know, now it's fine. We understand. Like, sure, you guys were a little
00:12:47 bit silly, but you've been demonetized. Every fucking piece, literally every PCP episode
00:12:54 until late, like late April has been demonetized. And I don't think they were at the time. I think
00:13:01 they've been changed since then. And these have all been confirmed by manual review. YouTube changed
00:13:06 their their policy. And then they just, I don't know, man. They said no low quality podcast allowed.
00:13:12 Well, no, it's because of the fucking swearing. Yeah.
00:13:17 Yeah, because I've been seeing a lot of people complain about getting demonetized.
00:13:20 Carlos Mazzo started a whole fucking thing with Vox and they came down on YouTube hard.
00:13:26 I mean, sure. But like, we are in no way, I mean, people could be offended by what we say,
00:13:30 but we're not like in any way attacking people. We just swear. No, it has nothing to do with that.
00:13:34 They just they just doubled down on everything. And there's like hundreds of channels.
00:13:38 Just for the sake of clarification, the Vox thing was completely coincidental,
00:13:43 like the timing with at which YouTube changed the terms of service.
00:13:49 You think so? That was actually the case, because like they had it
00:13:53 like a while in the making. And like, you know,
00:13:56 well, regardless of the cause, it's fucking bullshit because there's nothing
00:14:01 unfamily friendly about this podcast. And they should be begging us to line up to serve ads on
00:14:07 our podcast. I was going to say that it's about time they finally caught up to our shenanigans.
00:14:12 They finally caught up with the times, demonetized the menace that is the procrastinators podcast.
00:14:17 I mean, I get it. If you got like a family friendly company, you probably wouldn't want to be on a
00:14:22 rather crass podcast, which is this one, I guess. It doesn't make sense to me because of the fact
00:14:28 that you can target ads to people based on the data you get from their computer or whatever.
00:14:34 So give us the fucking big titty enhancement surgery ads or whatever, you know?
00:14:38 People who are not children also spend money. Like there's lots of people who
00:14:42 adverts are going to be useful to for them to see.
00:14:46 Like fucking like Dick's Razor sponsors, you know, like they themselves sponsor fucking,
00:14:52 what's his name? Harry's Razor.
00:14:54 Maddox X co-host, Dick Show, Dick Show. Okay, I understand those guys,
00:14:58 I don't think they have like ads on YouTube, but like people like those are obviously showing
00:15:03 that like they're perfectly happy to be on like rude, crass stuff.
00:15:07 So where's the why not why not have a category for that kind of stuff?
00:15:10 Yeah, we've got YouTube kids. What about YouTube? Not kids.
00:15:16 I don't know. Maybe maybe like YouTube dark red YouTube.
00:15:21 After dark YouTube after dark the whole site.
00:15:26 It's just in dark mode.
00:15:27 Dark mode has to be enabled always.
00:15:29 It's mandatory.
00:15:30 I don't know. Maybe it's like a kind of worms that they don't want to open for some reason.
00:15:34 You know, yeah, that's probably true. And I get that like YouTube,
00:15:38 you know, a lot of people will find it really easy to shit on YouTube.
00:15:40 I'm actually pretty sympathetic to a lot of these things that they're being forced to do with.
00:15:45 No.
00:15:45 Because these are questions that like no one in the world has been had to like sort out the
00:15:49 exact nitty-gritty of YouTube now.
00:15:50 Except for fucking television.
00:15:52 How come you're not sympathetic?
00:15:54 I want to know.
00:15:55 To YouTube?
00:15:56 Yeah.
00:15:57 Because like, I don't know. I mean, it's not even something that's like super like based in logic
00:16:03 to be fair.
00:16:04 It's just like, yeah, just like an emotional reaction.
00:16:07 Like, like we have, we have TV and we have radio.
00:16:11 These other mediums that existed forever.
00:16:13 And like they've sorted all this shit out.
00:16:15 It's not that difficult.
00:16:16 Right. But like the sheer amount of content that YouTube has as opposed to those other mediums.
00:16:22 It's just like.
00:16:22 I think it was.
00:16:23 What does that have to do with setting policy changes?
00:16:26 You know, like a policy.
00:16:27 Whether there's five channels or five million, your policy affects them all the same.
00:16:32 Right.
00:16:32 Yeah.
00:16:33 I think that the manual review thing, that's kind of bullshit.
00:16:35 The fact that you guys got the monetized form.
00:16:37 I don't think there even should need to be manual review.
00:16:40 There should just be simple policy that affects everything.
00:16:43 And it's like, okay, if you are, if you, if we detect swearing or whatever in your fucking thing,
00:16:49 we'll have, we have something for when you're an advertiser and you get on YouTube.
00:16:52 It's like, do you want your stuff in front of adult content?
00:16:55 Yes or no?
00:16:56 They check.
00:16:56 Yes.
00:16:57 You just go on whatever.
00:16:58 They check.
00:16:58 No.
00:16:59 If the system scans and figures out anything.
00:17:01 I mean, I would love that.
00:17:02 You just aren't put on those videos.
00:17:04 So that's why I have no mercy.
00:17:05 No, but like the thing about that is like, it's such an easy solution that like,
00:17:11 I, I, I can't help but think that they actually have a good reason for not doing it.
00:17:14 You know, because they probably make more money with the convoluted system they have right now.
00:17:18 I guess.
00:17:19 Well, I mean, maybe.
00:17:20 I mean, it seems to me.
00:17:21 But has money always been like the motor's operandi for YouTube?
00:17:24 I thought that the thing that they value most is like the advertiser information,
00:17:28 as opposed to like making, because like, aren't they always in the red?
00:17:32 Yeah, they never, they've never been profit.
00:17:34 From what I understand, hosting the videos puts them in the red,
00:17:37 but I'm sure the data that they're skimming now lets the rest of their business,
00:17:41 such as search and ad words, make way more fucking money.
00:17:44 I don't know how it all balances out.
00:17:45 Like the, so of course they're not going to make that data public because they don't want you to.
00:17:50 The idea that you had.
00:17:50 So everything speculation at the end of the day.
00:17:52 The idea that you had, Tom, about like advertisers checking if they want things,
00:17:57 like that would be great.
00:17:59 But I think the reason YouTube doesn't do that is not because YouTube like is good.
00:18:05 Like none of this is like, oh, YouTube's, you know, I'm not like
00:18:10 saying that any of these things means that I respect and trust YouTube,
00:18:14 because ultimately they do stuff that I don't like.
00:18:17 And even if they can't help but do it, I don't like it.
00:18:20 But it's probably just because big advertisers, because of various news things with like PewDiePie,
00:18:26 have this idea that YouTube can be like a really horrible place.
00:18:31 And so YouTube has to like double down on getting rid of adult content,
00:18:36 even if it's like not that bad, even if it's just a fuck word every so often.
00:18:41 They have to like, they have to be seen to be pushing that so hard
00:18:46 so that they can get the biggest advertisers back.
00:18:48 Don't you think it's stupid, right?
00:18:50 That YouTube costs, like the Carlos Mazda thing is like the newest like example of this,
00:18:56 but like YouTube has a history of doing this where the legacy media will like
00:19:00 write hit pieces about YouTube and they'll capitulate,
00:19:03 even though the legacy media is their competitor and they're just like allowing their
00:19:07 competition that's already like basically dead already.
00:19:11 Like YouTube won, like it is a bigger, more powerful platform.
00:19:14 But all these small sites are just like,
00:19:17 well, if we just keep writing hit pieces and we still have this like
00:19:21 image of power or whatever our influence, we can force this company to do what we want
00:19:26 to put us in a better position.
00:19:28 It's just like insanity to me.
00:19:30 Like there's a really interesting video series by PSACich talking about the last adpocalypse
00:19:36 and how it was all like, like purposely designed in order to
00:19:40 I saw that video.
00:19:42 It was fucking great.
00:19:43 Or one of them anyway.
00:19:45 There's like two of them, I think.
00:19:48 Wasn't there one that you were talking about with like Rupert Murdoch
00:19:51 being sort of like the market value?
00:19:52 That's the one, dude.
00:19:53 It's fucking fascinating.
00:19:56 You're like, he's behind it all.
00:19:58 And it sounds like you're in a beautiful mind room.
00:20:01 But at the same time, it sort of makes sense.
00:20:04 Right.
00:20:04 It's like one of those crackpot conspiracy theories that it's like,
00:20:06 yeah, but like the pieces really do kind of fall into place.
00:20:10 Like it's pretty compelling.
00:20:12 Well, I mean, when it comes to YouTube's action specifically,
00:20:17 like I it's your world.
00:20:19 We could all sit here all day and talk about like the things that we think are a better
00:20:24 policy for them.
00:20:26 It's just that like I feel that I don't want to be ungrateful.
00:20:30 Really is what it comes down to great.
00:20:32 And I have lots of sympathy for how like I was saying before,
00:20:36 like how complicated some of these questions really are about like,
00:20:38 like advertisers have expectations.
00:20:40 And then I think it's true like the media class will kind of try to swoop in on things
00:20:45 if it doesn't just have good optics.
00:20:47 So they have to like take that into consideration and like think,
00:20:50 OK, well, we can't.
00:20:53 Because the only reason advertisers are on YouTube is because they realize it's more
00:20:57 effective than traditional media platforms to get bigger reach for less money.
00:21:01 That's like the whole thing.
00:21:02 So if they don't want to play by the rules of being like,
00:21:05 yeah, new media is all about crazy fucking uncensored, insane content.
00:21:10 And you don't want to be a part of that.
00:21:11 Then just don't advertise on YouTube.
00:21:13 Like YouTube had all the power here because they were the ones.
00:21:16 They are the second biggest search engine on the Internet.
00:21:19 They are the single biggest website in existence.
00:21:22 They have all the eyeballs.
00:21:24 They had the power.
00:21:26 They could have said, you know what?
00:21:27 This is how the game is going to be played.
00:21:28 If you don't like it, have fun.
00:21:30 Advertising and like People Magazine are reaching seven people,
00:21:33 but they didn't do that.
00:21:34 They let themselves get co-opted by interests that are counter to their platform functioning
00:21:39 properly.
00:21:40 I would not give YouTube a free pass for like doing stupid shit on the regular
00:21:47 because of how stupid it is.
00:21:49 But I will say that there is some sort of like,
00:21:54 there's an element of like entitlement to being paid on the Internet.
00:22:00 Like this was not a thing that could be done like a decade ago,
00:22:04 or maybe two decades ago at this point.
00:22:06 So like I won't give YouTube a pass for being stupid,
00:22:10 but I will praise YouTube for at least existing as a free video
00:22:14 uploading site that has a large amount of people to see.
00:22:17 I'm not going to say here that like, oh,
00:22:19 YouTube like sucks and is the worst thing ever.
00:22:21 I just think YouTube is making shitty bad decisions in terms of running.
00:22:25 Perfectly fine.
00:22:26 Perfectly fine point.
00:22:27 Yeah.
00:22:30 Well, I don't know.
00:22:31 I mean, if they keep on capitulating, what is why then?
00:22:36 You know, is it because like they want the image of being like a legitimate source?
00:22:40 Because I mean, there's a lot of a lot of just evidence of Google and YouTube
00:22:48 wanting to be seen as in a certain political light.
00:22:53 Political might not even be the right word for it,
00:22:55 but just like social light like they want.
00:22:58 Yeah, like friendly stuff.
00:22:59 The quote unquote right side of history or whatever.
00:23:02 Like that's just like the zeitgeist, the cultural zeitgeist right now.
00:23:05 And because they're like a company that's like affects everybody,
00:23:08 they kind of have to like try and ride that wave just to be like, I guess safe.
00:23:13 I'm not really sure.
00:23:14 But like, but like, you know, it just seems that I mean,
00:23:19 I'm obviously biased in my assessment of this because I'm not like into the whole
00:23:24 politically correct thing.
00:23:25 So like when you capitulate to those ideas,
00:23:27 it just inherently pisses me off because I think they're bad ideas.
00:23:30 So I can't sit here and like be the objective arbiter of what YouTube is doing
00:23:34 and what Google is doing.
00:23:35 So my opinion obviously isn't the greatest in this sense,
00:23:40 but it just seems to me that like this site was built on the backs of people
00:23:45 doing weird fucking shit you wouldn't see on TV.
00:23:48 And in response, because TV is getting fucked and all these legacy
00:23:52 medias are getting fucked, they're trying to turn YouTube into a platform that
00:23:56 supports that kind of content at the expense of everyone who made the site
00:24:00 what it is today.
00:24:01 Without fucking crazy weird people, you wouldn't have this platform
00:24:05 to even get ruined like this in the first place.
00:24:07 And it's like you like YouTube should be in my opinion.
00:24:11 And I think most people would agree to me not TV.
00:24:15 It should be something else.
00:24:16 If you want to get a TV experience, you should go get a cable subscription.
00:24:22 If you want to see people in profitable and YouTube isn't.
00:24:26 Well, is it not profitable?
00:24:27 YouTube isn't profitable in terms of like hosting all the video, right?
00:24:33 So Google's responsible.
00:24:38 The question is why does Google continue to subsidize YouTube at all
00:24:42 if it's so unprofitable?
00:24:43 Well, I mean, I think there are many reasons why.
00:24:45 Yeah, I mean the data they're getting from it must be insane.
00:24:48 But like here's another thing.
00:24:49 Instead of like trying to like court advertisers and change what the product is,
00:24:53 like we have a small site like BitShoot, which is built on peer to peer
00:24:57 instead of having servers.
00:24:58 And they're drastically undercutting the cost of hosting video
00:25:01 because they're not hosting any videos really.
00:25:03 They're hosting the the torrent files.
00:25:06 So like it's not if like a bunch of people who are pissed off with YouTube
00:25:10 can make a quote unquote more efficient system.
00:25:13 I don't see why a massive multi-billion dollar company like Alphabet couldn't be like,
00:25:17 hey, maybe we should try and change the way that YouTube's underpinnings work
00:25:21 to make it more profitable for us short term.
00:25:25 Well, there's always going to be cultural inertia at the company
00:25:28 and a desire to change as little as possible.
00:25:30 Like like in order to do that, they might need to like go even further down the fuck
00:25:36 the common people and, you know, suck up to the big companies that can pay them to have.
00:25:41 I mean, but here's the thing, it's like you can suck up to the big companies all you want.
00:25:45 But are any of us going to say that Google is smaller than like the New York Times?
00:25:49 Like Google is the biggest company?
00:25:52 Well, what I mean by that is like investors, like an individual human being who makes a
00:25:59 YouTube channel and can make it big is more than it just being really nice as an idea.
00:26:06 It is kind of a marketing thing.
00:26:07 They want to keep that alive.
00:26:09 And I think if they need to make money short term, they're going to have to like
00:26:14 cut a lot of the people who are trying and like hogging up a lot of the, you know,
00:26:21 the data on the servers by not being that good.
00:26:25 They're going to need to like cut because it really is not profitable to have all these people
00:26:30 a free platform.
00:26:31 And like to keep, they have to keep that going because that's the gimmick.
00:26:35 But, you know, how do they do this is like it could be considered defeatist.
00:26:42 At the same time, I call it pragmatic.
00:26:44 It's just like, I'm not going to get mad at a business for being a business and trying
00:26:49 to attain more capital.
00:26:50 It's like, yeah, that's what it's always been like, whether it's social or monetary.
00:26:55 It's like, yeah, this is what I expected from the get go.
00:26:58 And like people getting mad at it.
00:27:00 It's like, well, you're just fighting like a, a, a Sisyphean struggle and not even that.
00:27:04 It's just like, you're not going to get to, you're not going to appeal to the morality,
00:27:09 you know?
00:27:09 Sure, of course.
00:27:10 Like, like I can be righteously indignated all I want, but I'm not going to expect YouTube
00:27:15 to make better decisions.
00:27:16 They clearly have their agenda.
00:27:19 You've got guys like Carlos Mazza making an explicitly moral case for changes to the contrary.
00:27:24 And it's not like he had a ton of influence, but at least the one thing that was done in
00:27:29 response to that was, you know, like Steven Crowder being demonetized, which I mean, I
00:27:34 didn't, I don't know the exact details, but I think that they said first, he hadn't violated
00:27:38 any rules, but they changed it.
00:27:42 Violate rules?
00:27:42 No, no.
00:27:43 It's so weird.
00:27:44 They said that they didn't violate any rules.
00:27:45 It just goes to show, like, how, it's like, how, how, you know, the way that they do it
00:27:51 is so case by case, they don't even follow their own guidelines.
00:27:55 Like if they had, well, that's why I want to follow, they just be like, okay, yeah,
00:27:58 he either did do it or didn't do it, but then they like flipped on the decision.
00:28:02 Right.
00:28:03 Like what do they do?
00:28:03 Because of the public outcry.
00:28:05 They're just trying to protect the room to be able to take whatever position is the
00:28:08 most convenient at the time.
00:28:10 That's why they don't want to convict, could like commit to either being a publisher
00:28:13 or a like a free, you know, open platform for everybody because they want to be able
00:28:18 to take whichever position works for them.
00:28:19 Well, all of social media has that problem.
00:28:21 It's not just a, and I get it.
00:28:23 I want to do the same thing too.
00:28:24 If I was them, it's the most interesting thing with Carlos Mazza.
00:28:27 How I had nothing to do with that in the first place.
00:28:29 And they were just using that as a leverage to fuck over Fox to get more money because
00:28:32 there was a huge strike going on at Fox.
00:28:34 And anyway, that, that, that's true.
00:28:36 And they're trying to hurt YouTube as a platform because that's how Fox makes their
00:28:39 money, but they don't care how fuck YouTube is because Fox pays them.
00:28:43 It is a coincidence.
00:28:44 I'm, I'm a pretty anti-conspiratorial guy though, which is sometimes I probably miss
00:28:48 things because I'm so like not.
00:28:50 I really don't want to be that guy, but like there may legitimately be some connection
00:28:54 between the fact this attack came at that time and Fox was trying to negotiate.
00:28:58 Or like Carlos Mazza was talking about how fuck Fox is and how they need to change their
00:29:02 shit and then does this.
00:29:04 It's just like, I mean, I'm not in his head.
00:29:06 I can't, I can't say for sure that that was what happened, but it just, you know, looking
00:29:11 at the evidence, it's like there is a case to be made there and who the fuck knows.
00:29:17 All I know is that YouTube is going to do what it does.
00:29:20 I don't expect it to ever get better.
00:29:21 I only expect it to get worse because that's been the trend for the last 10 years.
00:29:25 I don't see it changing.
00:29:27 And so I'm just waiting.
00:29:28 You can't even remember a time when we weren't talking about how YouTube is fucking up and
00:29:34 making terrible decisions and ruining everything.
00:29:36 I mean, back in like 2007, like it was pretty dope.
00:29:39 Well, no, I think people always complained, but the complaints they had were like, oh,
00:29:45 why did they change the layout?
00:29:46 Right.
00:29:47 It was really very smooth.
00:29:48 People like to complain.
00:29:50 It's just like, we didn't know how good we had it.
00:29:52 Yeah.
00:29:53 All we had to worry about was shit.
00:29:55 I don't know where my buttons went.
00:29:57 You know, it hasn't been until the last like five plus years that any of us were even on
00:30:01 this side of the fence.
00:30:03 Yeah.
00:30:03 Yeah.
00:30:03 That's true.
00:30:04 That's true.
00:30:04 So I didn't give a shit about monetization back when I wasn't even thinking about it.
00:30:09 You know, right.
00:30:11 And I'm sure this would be a more common case if because like what site is there like YouTube
00:30:17 where it's this big and there are this many people making money from it.
00:30:22 You know, Uber, Uber, Uber, I'm talking about like a YouTube, YouTube is video Uber.
00:30:29 Maybe like Instagram only Instagram doesn't pay its people.
00:30:32 Instead of taking you from point A to point B, you're taking them on like an like an emotional
00:30:36 like video journey.
00:30:38 Like I'll let me teach you about like precisely something like hey guys, we we we the company
00:30:46 will pay you some like piddling amount of like what your what your what your videos are worth.
00:30:53 But like, you know, you can just but the sky's the limit.
00:30:56 Like it's you know, it's like a fuck it.
00:30:57 I don't know.
00:30:58 I can't I can't wait.
00:31:00 We'll give you the tools to make content for us.
00:31:05 It's like they do that with like the music catalog that they make available.
00:31:08 And you know, of course, all the tools to just uploading and premiering and
00:31:12 super chats and that kind of stuff.
00:31:13 Yeah, which of course they benefit from.
00:31:16 I can't wait to get into my Uber.
00:31:18 I can't wait to get into my Uber and the guy to look at me and be like,
00:31:20 hey, Tom, sorry, I haven't driven you anywhere in a while.
00:31:23 Oh, yes.
00:31:30 Oh, now I want that.
00:31:31 Now I want now I want an Uber driver to be like vlogging while Uber driving.
00:31:35 Now that's doubling up on content.
00:31:37 That's just smart.
00:31:37 That's just the way to do it, man.
00:31:39 Hey guys, I got some freaks in the back right now.
00:31:42 I'm just trying to make a YouTube channel about being an Uber driver.
00:31:45 And you just it's like Uber is like playing Russian roulette.
00:31:50 But instead of dying, if you get the bull, you actually just have an extremely euphoric
00:31:54 experience of talking to some bizarre absolute freak.
00:31:57 For instance, most of the time, let's get like a nothing burger, just absolute like,
00:32:01 oh, guy with glasses or guy with hair.
00:32:04 But then if you're out on the prowl late at night like I am, you know,
00:32:08 scrounging for trash on Newberry Street and you call your guy at like 2am, then he'll come
00:32:14 and he'll be fully dressed and drag literally in dominatrix gear, dominatrix gear, not a joke
00:32:22 and offer you candy, which you will of course accept with a whole open hand.
00:32:27 You will just get poured candy candy from this man.
00:32:30 And it will be a great time and you'll talk to him about his ex wives.
00:32:34 Literally just the best experience I've ever had.
00:32:36 Uber drivers are the weird Uber drivers specifically are a treat to the world.
00:32:42 Truly.
00:32:43 I haven't had many experiences like that.
00:32:45 People just talk about crazy taxidrivers and stuff.
00:32:47 But I don't know.
00:32:48 Mostly they're just like quiet, older guys who clearly do not want to be doing this.
00:32:53 But I don't know if they've fallen on hard times, their their corporate job got,
00:32:57 you know, shipped off to China.
00:32:59 And so now they had one Uber driver who was really into his car and he was just like,
00:33:05 hey, check this out and just kind of a little bit.
00:33:08 Imagine if he does that with every single passenger.
00:33:14 Dude, check out how I can rev with fucking engine, bro.
00:33:17 Look at my car, how fast it can go.
00:33:19 Just a little bit.
00:33:20 Just a little bit, just enough to make me uncomfortable.
00:33:24 My favorite thing about Uber drivers though, they are the exact archetype of character
00:33:28 that I enjoy, which is to say people who are really like enthused about bizarre things that
00:33:34 don't matter at all.
00:33:35 For instance, there was one Uber driver I was in the car with who just was,
00:33:38 just completely hung up about Hangover Part 2.
00:33:42 And he just loved the Hangover Part 2 specifically.
00:33:47 And the entire time he was just talking to me about how, you know,
00:33:51 oh, it's kind of dangerous on the street, you know, like in Hangover Part 2,
00:33:54 they got into a lot of trouble back out of there.
00:33:56 And I just think we got to be real careful nowadays, you know.
00:33:59 You know about the combat zone back in Boston, there used to be a combat zone.
00:34:03 People would be, they'd shave your back for a nickel and put the Hangover Part 2.
00:34:09 They wouldn't do that if you gave them a $5 bill.
00:34:12 I'm like, oh, God, let me out.
00:34:14 I think you remember too much of that.
00:34:15 I think you're destined to become an Uber driver.
00:34:18 You know what?
00:34:19 Maybe so.
00:34:20 And if I am, I accept that Disney with open arms.
00:34:24 Because I love it.
00:34:25 Could you imagine having Munchie as an Uber driver?
00:34:28 Oh, God.
00:34:31 Munchie is famously post job, along with his whole generation.
00:34:34 Being an Uber driver is definitely post job.
00:34:36 Oh, 100%.
00:34:38 Buckle your seat belts!
00:34:40 We're going on a bumpy ride!
00:34:42 Goes two miles an hour because I'm scared of driving.
00:34:45 Just be a Boston Uber driver and not respond to any locations in the real world,
00:34:51 but simply use, you know, slime city locations.
00:34:54 Are they going to say not respond to people when they talk to me?
00:34:58 Just like open the door and just like if they try to speak to me.
00:35:02 Just like say, oh no, I can't do that.
00:35:03 You know what that reminds me of though?
00:35:05 When I was in Japan, there were these restaurants that you, before you enter,
00:35:10 it's like a vending machine on the outside where you select the food you want.
00:35:12 And you put it in and you put your money in, like a vending machine.
00:35:15 It gives you a ticket and it also prints it on the inside.
00:35:18 You just go sit down and the guy behind the counter, like he got the ticket on his side
00:35:22 and he just like, you know, brings it where you need to be.
00:35:25 There should be, actually now that I think about this is exactly how Uber works
00:35:28 because they are given the location that you're going to ahead of time.
00:35:30 And so they know beforehand before they even pick you up
00:35:33 if they want to drive you there or not.
00:35:35 So the future is now, I guess.
00:35:37 We did it in Japan.
00:35:38 Truly.
00:35:40 I missed those restaurants though.
00:35:41 They were the best.
00:35:42 I didn't have to talk to anyone.
00:35:44 Oh, that's the way.
00:35:45 Do you think this is the way to de-populate Japan?
00:35:47 I don't want to be presumptuous in assuming that you all have,
00:35:57 you've all had the experience of having a bad computer or laptop.
00:36:00 Is that true?
00:36:01 Of course.
00:36:02 I mean, I think it exists without having that experience.
00:36:05 So that means you can truly appreciate that I recently, yesterday,
00:36:11 got a beautiful 28 gig RAM, 512 SSD, 512 gig SSD laptop yesterday.
00:36:23 Oh, it's beautiful.
00:36:24 It runs.
00:36:25 I bet Minecraft runs like a dream.
00:36:27 It runs like a dream.
00:36:28 You have no idea.
00:36:29 I love it so much.
00:36:31 And that's exactly the reason.
00:36:32 I got that feeling the other day.
00:36:33 Or like a couple of months ago, I got my new desktop.
00:36:35 Oh, this will feel like, dude, when you can open up Firefox
00:36:38 doesn't take literally like two and a half minutes to load.
00:36:42 Dude, it's fucking beautiful.
00:36:43 It's like the contrast between like the old laptop that you had the day before and like this one.
00:36:48 Oh, oh, yeah.
00:36:49 Beautiful.
00:36:49 Oh, yeah.
00:36:50 And it's like, that's exactly why I offered to edit this episode because of that.
00:36:54 Oh, just for the sheer joy of doing the end of the process.
00:36:56 Oh, seeing the render off.
00:36:57 That render bar fill up like way faster.
00:37:00 And just like, oh, my pet peeve with my old laptop was the fact that when I was rendering,
00:37:08 I couldn't do anything else with the laptop because I took up all of the RAM.
00:37:12 So literally, I uploaded a video that was like four minutes yesterday,
00:37:18 and it took an hour and a half to render.
00:37:21 All right.
00:37:21 That's insane.
00:37:22 Absolutely.
00:37:22 That's insane.
00:37:24 I rendered a video today about the same time.
00:37:27 Took a minute.
00:37:29 Beautiful.
00:37:29 Took one minute.
00:37:30 Oh, my God.
00:37:31 Oh, my God.
00:37:32 Oh, yeah.
00:37:32 Yeah, that's insane.
00:37:34 You know, I don't know if this is just me, but I feel like, I mean,
00:37:37 this definitely happened with my old computer.
00:37:39 I've got a relatively new one.
00:37:40 It's pretty great.
00:37:41 Tom helped me build it and stuff, or help me pick out the parts.
00:37:44 And I moved stuff Tom as well when I made my computer, so.
00:37:47 Indeed.
00:37:47 God bless, Tom.
00:37:48 I feel like it's taking longer and longer for renders to happen.
00:37:51 And I'm just wondering, like, what processes can I do to clean this up so it stays pristine?
00:37:56 Oh, yeah.
00:37:57 I've been wondering about that as well because I've noticed my computer is like taking like
00:38:01 five minutes to boot up now.
00:38:04 It's a long time.
00:38:05 I think I need to like defragment or something or like clean up some stuff.
00:38:11 Because it was, I hadn't really added that much more things.
00:38:14 I don't think.
00:38:15 Yeah, yeah.
00:38:17 I mean, I just, I assume it's just like adding junk to, I mean, I don't know,
00:38:20 when you install stuff, sometimes there's just like, not installers, but like run,
00:38:24 like it was start up processes, just start up, and then they just eat up.
00:38:28 Yeah, I got, I went to settings to like turn off the things that happen on startup,
00:38:32 but it wasn't even that many things.
00:38:35 And it's still taking a little longer than I would like.
00:38:38 I just assumed that it's like, it's like a big bag.
00:38:41 My computer is like a big cloth bag.
00:38:43 And I just throw software in there and they all got piled up.
00:38:46 And then it's like on Christmas day, when you're at Timmy's house and you got to give
00:38:49 him his present and you're reaching around.
00:38:51 Oh, there's so much.
00:38:51 I can't find it.
00:38:52 Why is the fucking, why are you at Timmy's house on Christmas?
00:38:56 Because I am Santa Claus.
00:38:57 Your parents kick you out.
00:38:58 Okay.
00:38:59 There you go.
00:38:59 I am Santa.
00:39:01 And it's very unfortunate.
00:39:03 This is how I imagine computers work.
00:39:04 I actually do know how they work.
00:39:06 I did, in fact, go to school for this, but none of that.
00:39:08 No, computers are like magic, dudes.
00:39:10 You know, you put a weasel in a box and he makes it go, wha!
00:39:14 Exactly.
00:39:14 True or anything, exactly.
00:39:17 I built an OS once in college.
00:39:19 I mean, it was very simple OS, but it worked.
00:39:20 Oh, temple OS?
00:39:22 Oh, best OS ever.
00:39:23 I know about allocating RAM and shit.
00:39:24 Is it, was it, was it you call it best OS ever?
00:39:28 I, oh, actually what it was was, it was a, no, I did not, but it's an OS that the,
00:39:33 like they give you like, here are the specs.
00:39:35 Make this in Python.
00:39:36 At least I think we use Python.
00:39:38 And just like have it run with exactly these parameters.
00:39:41 So it's not like we let like come up with like an original OS.
00:39:44 They gave us one to make and it was like,
00:39:46 everybody's is going to work pretty much the same.
00:39:48 Oh, so you were a sheep.
00:39:49 You didn't, you didn't make it yourself.
00:39:51 You know, you were just following orders.
00:39:52 Well, that wasn't the assignment.
00:39:53 Now was it, Munchy?
00:39:54 I'm not Jim.
00:39:55 I'm not here to learn.
00:39:56 I'm here to do.
00:40:00 I am Nate does his homework best man.
00:40:02 That's me.
00:40:04 Can we all just talk about how great Jim Microsoft is?
00:40:07 I love that guy.
00:40:08 He's really done good work.
00:40:10 I like Jim Microsoft, but I hate when I go to the Jim Microsoft
00:40:13 and he starts beating the shit out of me just because I entered his domain.
00:40:19 Wait, I go to the Microsoft gym and I push computers to gain muscle mass.
00:40:24 That's the right thing.
00:40:25 I like Microsoft penis.
00:40:26 I, my penis, yes.
00:40:29 We can all agree on that one.
00:40:32 When you're running on fumes and your bryos start to shut down,
00:40:35 I have experienced that multiple times throughout this past week.
00:40:39 Throughout this call.
00:40:41 It's wax and wane.
00:40:43 I like, you know, I would start curing, becoming disheveled.
00:40:45 Then I would like wake up a little bit, you know,
00:40:47 someone would say something.
00:40:48 Then I would just recede back into the annals of just
00:40:51 docking foreskin and other man's penis.
00:40:53 Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:40:56 But for the past like week, I have been creating and have released
00:41:00 and it's already all done in a series of updates for endless war
00:41:04 that have involved an ARG.
00:41:07 And there's this out of cash.
00:41:09 This is oh, see guys, sorry.
00:41:11 So don't worry about that.
00:41:11 There's no way this is going to top the Japanese juggalo.
00:41:14 I'm just putting that out there right now.
00:41:15 We've nothing, nothing can.
00:41:17 Nothing can in society, like not just like the Japanese juggalo ARG,
00:41:23 but just like, you know, in general, the Japanese juggalo.
00:41:25 We've hit peak culture.
00:41:27 I remember, I remember when I first met Econ,
00:41:30 we first met Econ at Anime Expo like 2017, I think.
00:41:34 I don't like, like, like the first thing that we said to him
00:41:38 is just that he was asking, you know, like what we did.
00:41:40 And you said that you had a YouTube channel.
00:41:42 I was like, oh, yeah, I did anime videos too.
00:41:44 Then I put on the Japanese juggalo form.
00:41:49 He didn't know what he was in for.
00:41:50 Anyway, so I did a, I hosted a successful, I'll say, ARG.
00:41:56 In, in this war.
00:41:58 And it was a great experience.
00:42:00 And like, legitimately, like it's a really like
00:42:03 enchanted magical feeling.
00:42:06 When you have constructed this puzzle for people
00:42:08 and you hit the sweet spot of not too hard, not too easy.
00:42:12 And you can hear them do like their, their brains rattling off.
00:42:16 Like, you know, like their CPUs overheating,
00:42:18 trying to figure out the puzzles that you said,
00:42:20 but they are exhilarated by it.
00:42:21 They're not just absolutely defeated by it.
00:42:23 And you can see them like work through and like just discover
00:42:26 and like soak up all the lore that even viewed into each image.
00:42:29 And that was incredible.
00:42:30 The payoff of it was great.
00:42:31 And I'm extremely, I'm just happy with how it turned out.
00:42:34 However, the preceding hours of my life,
00:42:38 I can only describe as just literally the Majora's Mask commercial from 2000,
00:42:44 where it is a faux radio announcer saying the world's ending
00:42:48 and that he is pressuring this kid who's playing Majora's Mask
00:42:52 to win or else the entire world will die.
00:42:54 And then there's spliced an interview of various people in real life
00:42:57 saying that they missed their parents.
00:42:59 That was literally what my life was.
00:43:02 I don't know how to say this kid, but there's not a lot of time left.
00:43:05 Play hard, will ya?
00:43:07 So literally for the, like previous to me releasing that,
00:43:11 I had been awake for several days and unironically,
00:43:15 just going fucking ham.
00:43:18 The amount of things that I had written in that time
00:43:22 were akin to maybe 500 clay slash stone tablets,
00:43:28 depending on the mining quality that I could possibly achieve at the same time.
00:43:34 And etching those runes into that stone was a difficult process.
00:43:39 And I'm going to spare you the details
00:43:40 because I'm not here to suck my own dick or take up the show for any longer.
00:43:43 But I just want to say that to set up for my real anecdote here,
00:43:48 just know that I, this is our, I believe, 27.
00:43:52 I'm almost done.
00:43:54 I've written mountains and mountains of work.
00:43:57 I'm almost, the end is in sight, mere hours.
00:44:01 Literally two hours before it's set to go live.
00:44:04 And I have a hard day.
00:44:05 I released a video on the PCP you might have seen
00:44:07 in coming Slamtorp Transmission.
00:44:08 There's a hard date set on there for an in-game event
00:44:11 that would be happening to set out.
00:44:12 So yeah, I had a hard date that I,
00:44:14 or rather a hard time in that date that I had to achieve.
00:44:18 Or else things would go fucking south.
00:44:20 So, two hours until that time.
00:44:22 Almost done.
00:44:23 Make it, you know, make it, make it a good time.
00:44:24 I mean, I'm feeling good.
00:44:25 Make it count.
00:44:26 You know, you know, I-
00:44:26 So that's by the time people hear this.
00:44:28 It will have been several days.
00:44:30 Oh, oh yes.
00:44:30 No, yeah.
00:44:31 Yeah, of course.
00:44:32 The time thing always fucked me.
00:44:33 Okay, I'm with you.
00:44:34 I'm with you.
00:44:34 Say it.
00:44:34 Um, and so, you know, I'm doing good,
00:44:37 but I can't take any more breaks, you know.
00:44:38 I've had my mandatory one hour every 12 hours where I go to eat.
00:44:45 I've already had that.
00:44:45 I can't do anymore.
00:44:47 But I'm on track, and then I get a phone call.
00:44:50 I answer.
00:44:51 It's my mom.
00:44:52 She says the following words to me.
00:44:54 Hello.
00:44:55 The cable band's here.
00:44:57 He needs to see the modem
00:44:59 so that he can install a camera on the front door.
00:45:04 Okay.
00:45:06 And then she hangs up.
00:45:07 And then she hangs up.
00:45:09 And then, like, I just slow pan out to my room,
00:45:15 which is a disheveled tornado mess.
00:45:18 Literally corpses in here, as far as I can tell.
00:45:21 There's just blood and shit smeared on every single surface.
00:45:26 And the amount of quake energy cans that are just crumpled up near me
00:45:32 could, like, just recycling.
00:45:34 Done.
00:45:35 The moment that I turn these cans in.
00:45:37 We don't need to do it anymore because I've done it enough.
00:45:40 Metal is saved.
00:45:41 Renewable resource found.
00:45:43 And so I haven't showered.
00:45:46 I'm just a complete mess full of wax and brimstone.
00:45:50 And I have to just open the door for this cable man who, of course,
00:45:55 I did not know this person was coming.
00:45:57 Of course, there was no, you know, hey, hey, Anthony, there's a dude coming, by the way,
00:46:01 most important day of your life.
00:46:04 The most important day of your entire social experience online.
00:46:08 All this guy coming to ruin it.
00:46:11 So I had to open my door.
00:46:12 I just had this man violate my personal space.
00:46:15 Violate my room.
00:46:16 Just fuck around with my modem.
00:46:17 You know, just drill a hole into it.
00:46:19 Stick his dick and come in and say, oh, this is fine, right?
00:46:22 No, it's not fine.
00:46:23 It's not.
00:46:25 And I get to work up into a tizia.
00:46:26 Just walk downstairs.
00:46:27 I allow him to do his work in my room.
00:46:29 I come downstairs and I say, hey, I say, hey, what's going on?
00:46:32 What's this about a camera on the front door?
00:46:34 And they're like, oh, actually, we misheard him.
00:46:36 We don't even want him to do this.
00:46:38 Like, we just got a bundle.
00:46:38 So we had to let him do it.
00:46:39 But we don't even want the features in time.
00:46:41 But he's installing smart lights.
00:46:43 So we'll get an app on our phone where you can dim the light smart phone.
00:46:46 Well, with that being neat.
00:46:53 An hour goes by.
00:46:55 An hour of time lost.
00:46:58 I do not have this time to spare.
00:47:00 I do not.
00:47:00 I just walk out to my farm and I want to plow the field.
00:47:04 I do not want to plow the seeds of the ocean.
00:47:07 I don't know if I get against the waves of the world.
00:47:09 And yet I am fucked.
00:47:10 I do so.
00:47:12 And I go and I and I and I must have the words flow from my finger at this point.
00:47:16 I have exiled cable man and it's coming down to the fucking wire.
00:47:22 I release the video like mere like minutes before it's set to go off.
00:47:28 Basically, no one knows what's happening.
00:47:30 But the fact remains that I did it technically correct.
00:47:34 I'm seething and I'm panting.
00:47:36 And I and I log in to my alternate account that the character,
00:47:41 you know, blah, blah, blah character, ARG stuff.
00:47:43 And I do it like within 10 minutes from the event happening.
00:47:49 But I do it.
00:47:50 But I do it and it's glorious.
00:47:51 And I just wanted to share that little story with you because I hate cable man
00:47:55 and I hate modems and I hate smart lights.
00:47:58 And I hate all of you.
00:48:00 If you're listening to this, play hard kid, win this one, will you?
00:48:04 I appreciate that.
00:48:06 I appreciate that.
00:48:08 I will say in my dad demeanor that one really should never find themselves ever
00:48:13 if it can be avoided in a position where an hour of distraction will make or break
00:48:18 some great enterprise.
00:48:19 It should be ready significantly ahead of time
00:48:22 so that you don't have to be in a crunch time like that.
00:48:25 But I'm not one to talk having literally failed me a math of a two.
00:48:30 Now am I?
00:48:30 So, you know, I will say a point, Nate.
00:48:34 There's something oddly like I find like perversely erotic about crunch time.
00:48:39 And I know it's bad.
00:48:40 And I know that everyone's gonna cancel me on Twitter.
00:48:43 I know everyone's gonna-
00:48:45 I know what those game devs are complaining about.
00:48:47 I'd be jacking my at full mass the entire time while boss man whips me into submission
00:48:52 as I crank out that last, you know, animation on the bull testicles
00:48:56 in Red Dev Redemption 2.
00:48:57 I know like five minutes after release this episode,
00:49:00 Super Bonnie Hopkins in a release of Angry Video that has me as the subject.
00:49:04 But like I'm just saying that like crunch time,
00:49:08 looking it ruins my body.
00:49:10 It like it literally like makes me like ill and like I felt sick for like a day or two
00:49:14 afterward.
00:49:15 And it wasn't cool.
00:49:15 I was a very unhealthy man during me a math of a two.
00:49:18 Just just in general as a lifestyle thing for sure.
00:49:20 But like there's something about like dude, I'm getting shit done.
00:49:25 Like I'm achieving goals right now.
00:49:27 Literally like I see a goal and I'm running towards it.
00:49:31 Like it feels good in that way.
00:49:33 Obviously there's a lot of downsides, but it feels good just-
00:49:37 It's the classic Shonen trope in which the MC obtains a retarded power that gives him
00:49:45 extra strength, but at the extremely nebulous cost of like quote,
00:49:49 some of his lifespan or quote, it's shortening his life.
00:49:53 It's just the most, you never have to worry about that while the series is going on.
00:49:57 It's a total like Deus Ex Machina piece of shit answer to give a false cost to whatever
00:50:03 the characters are doing, but it's pretty sick.
00:50:06 I kind of literally agree that like okay, I've recently come to the conclusion that like
00:50:10 basically no bodily harm is that bad.
00:50:12 Like you know you can treat your body poorly and like you know it's not good,
00:50:17 but like you know like it's it'll be fine.
00:50:20 Like I've taken it just not eating.
00:50:22 We may reevaluate that.
00:50:24 I've taken it just not eating because like you know like whatever, like you don't eat it.
00:50:28 Whatever dude.
00:50:29 What's the worst that could happen?
00:50:30 Yeah, you know literally.
00:50:32 Die.
00:50:34 That is the worst.
00:50:35 Munchy, I have like not necessarily for like the like I know exactly that feeling,
00:50:42 but like not exactly for because um because the the the prospect of like producing stuff
00:50:48 still like or doing good work because sometimes I just feel like shit
00:50:53 like everything is going wrong and I am so ragged like run ragged like I smell like shit.
00:51:00 I feel like shit like I've got both legs broken like blood everywhere piss everywhere
00:51:06 like nobody knows how bad I've got it um and I'm just like I'm standing there like with all my
00:51:11 skin like falling off like I'm I'm dead like I'm a zombie from from Dark Souls and I have like
00:51:18 one arm that can work and I'm looking at like a sheer cliff face and there's like
00:51:23 there's you know I could just sit down but there's there's something there's something really cool
00:51:27 about like just continuing like even though every bone in my body aches and like I'm just
00:51:33 not feeling it and I feel like shit and it's terrible and everything sucks I'm I'm just climbing
00:51:38 that mountain I'm climbing and I like nobody will know that the like there's something like
00:51:45 um uh there's there's a way to describe it but it's like
00:51:50 like the the the feeling that even though I'm not going to boast about having done this I know I've
00:51:55 done it right and and like I I I like the fact that nobody will uh like care that I done it
00:52:05 you you like the fact that I don't care I don't know why it's like it's some some sort of weird
00:52:10 dad thing like dad's like just doesn't matter dad's like complaining about like things not being fair
00:52:15 and things being fucked up and like everything sucks um but they don't really do anything to
00:52:21 make it better they just like to complain well I think just inherently like like everyone in the
00:52:26 entire world can agree that doing something that's dumb but doing something that's hard sexy as hell
00:52:33 that's so cool well true America loves winners the whole world does really uh yeah yeah I don't
00:52:41 know like I don't know whether other people understand this like the lack of recognition
00:52:47 because I'm I don't I don't usually bag a bragging boast um no no no I I totally understand where
00:52:52 you're coming from and this is sort of tangential but it applies so uh I was I was leasing a place
00:52:59 for a couple years and uh it came to the point where uh my roommates were uh starting to get a
00:53:06 little messy little messy you know and uh you know I I decided to become the house mom I did all
00:53:13 the dishes I uh I cleaned the tables I uh sweep the kitchen you know what it is and you know what
00:53:19 I never asked for gratitude I was like yeah this is what the house mom does and I just felt good
00:53:25 knowing that they see they see the kitchen next time and uh something that they left on the table
00:53:32 is no more there because I cleaned it up and they could have done it but I did it
00:53:36 because I'm the house mom you got you got taken advantage of my friends that's unpaid labor right
00:53:44 there my it is it is you got a demand compensation you know my compensation is feeling good about
00:53:50 job well done what a worthless currency if ever there was one the way I would explain the feeling
00:53:56 is like if I'm like really tired after doing a lot of work and stuff and then somebody says
00:54:02 hey we're going out to this thing and I'm like not in the mood at all but there's this there's this
00:54:08 you know it's good to be social like it's a good idea even if I'm not really feeling it I may as
00:54:14 well so I go to this thing um and nothing good comes of it and I come home no and it's like
00:54:22 at least I tried I guess that's the somewhat of the feeling sure yeah absolutely like doing
00:54:28 doing stuff even though you're not in the best of places it just feels good rather than than
00:54:34 than appeasing your base instinct to sit and do nothing and watch anime and play video games or
00:54:39 whatever it is yes yes which by the way this reminds me of I so I mentioned it before about my
00:54:45 quote-unquote failing me a math of a two I mean you know I can I can see why people consider that
00:54:49 because I did not succeed at getting one video out every day but uh there's one interesting
00:54:54 thing about it um so I heard a bunch of people shitting on like the last episode of me a math
00:54:59 of a two for one you know uh being a piece of shit begging for money uh you know bragging about my
00:55:05 vast internet success by showing my play button uh doing a terrible tier list section and then
00:55:11 playing a terrible cover of a uh boring hacky song wait Nate hold on it's all champion super
00:55:17 okay can we please smash cut to me earlier today scrolling through the comments of that video
00:55:22 specifically saying like Nate your singing voice is amazing ha ha wow even though I can't give money
00:55:28 you're an inspiration me Nate tee he well okay it's all about the human tendency to focus on the
00:55:36 negative absolutely absolutely true absolutely true but but I'm not even I'm not even saying that I
00:55:42 particularly think it was an overly negative reception but I'm just saying that there were
00:55:46 some voices that were critical there was a dude that had the same avatar focusing on it oh yeah I
00:55:51 appreciate that thanks a lot um but okay but my point was I what I what I felt was that like I had
00:55:58 made some very specific mistakes that led people to being uh critical of that and it was like by the
00:56:04 thing about me a math of a is just that it was set up to be one day one video so that even people who
00:56:10 hate me a math of a which I'm sure there are some or you know people who find my more I don't know my
00:56:15 less heavily edited content which I've been doing the last couple years is like less interesting than
00:56:19 like a best anime ever like they want smash videos they want that stuff where is it Nate so I totally
00:56:23 get why those people would like not be interested want to tune out any of that stuff and but the
00:56:28 thing is the the conceit on the ground is that you're getting 30 days of a 31 days of like a video a
00:56:34 day and after that you're free and after that you your debt is paid to society viewer subscriber
00:56:40 and you don't have to sit through any more of this the problem is by me getting off my schedule
00:56:45 one I'm pissing off those people who are like can we just be done with this um two by taking longer
00:56:52 to make videos it inherently raises expectations for what those videos are going to be so people
00:56:58 like with that last they were like wow like we waited three days this was the last episode of me
00:57:02 in MAFA not everybody said that but you know some people did and then finally the other problem and
00:57:07 this is the biggest one that ties into Gibbs Gibbs thing is that I personally like feel bad about all
00:57:14 this and I the thought comes into your mind of like can I like just not release anymore because I
00:57:20 don't think anybody like there's diminishing returns on me in MAFA too uh like this was evident
00:57:24 from the start um but like I owed it to like the promise of the of the of the program I guess
00:57:31 to get all the videos out but once you're past the deadline by like 20 days and you know people are
00:57:36 getting a little ornery and they want you to get back to your other stuff it's like what's the use
00:57:40 in continuing this and I mean I had to do it but it was like it was like a weird self-doubt
00:57:46 position I found myself in of like I know people just want me to move on to other stuff but I
00:57:50 promised I would do this and you know for all these reasons there are these negative consequences
00:57:56 that are going to come no matter what so so the answer simply is you know maybe I'll do a me in
00:58:00 MAFA again in the future but I I have there is no choice but to stick to the schedule for all
00:58:06 those reasons and uh I don't know and like because the original conceit is just to motivate me to
00:58:12 make content to to exactly feel what you were talking about kid to like feel like I'm doing
00:58:17 something as opposed to nothing like I because the original me in MAFA was maybe I can actually
00:58:21 make a fucking video or maybe I'll actually make a fucking video like me doing something as opposed
00:58:26 to nothing not these six month long projects um but now people know I can make a fucking video
00:58:32 so there's not a lot to prove um I don't know I don't know I was just reflecting on this and
00:58:37 I thought the whole the idea of like how it getting off schedule had a myriad of negative
00:58:44 effects both for me and for the people watching um it was it was a good learning experience if
00:58:50 nothing else um but I but I don't know I don't know it ties into all this stuff I realize I hadn't
00:58:56 watched your final episode all the way through I go over to it and I'm I'm seven minutes in
00:59:01 and I like the first seven minutes but then you start doing a tierless and I guess I just
00:59:05 was like oh lol who cares and I start joke but it is like a 15 minute long segment so that's I
00:59:11 get why some people are not a joke yeah well but okay it's a joke but it's also substantive
00:59:18 because it is a reflection on the entire me in MAFA two experience so you know sure there's an
00:59:25 I actually haven't watched it yet because uh my subscription feed is just it's so weird well it's
00:59:32 it's completely normal but the way that I interact with it is weird like I just well as that tier
00:59:37 list will tell you oh yeah sorry but as that tier list will tell you not every video is a gem so
00:59:43 don't feel you know any burning need to fucking sit through it all uh but some are but some are
00:59:49 the the fairy tale is dead featuring Zach Rittner oh no I've watched me a man for a
00:59:55 I just haven't watched the last one you know this is a this is another weird thing do you ever
01:00:00 okay this is just a general thing with all of us people we all make content we all make videos
01:00:05 isn't it kind of a weird thing when like you're talking to your buddies or whatever who like
01:00:08 know you make a content of some kind and it's gonna make you make it a content yeah like like I'm
01:00:15 talking about this thing like I I never feel this I really don't well okay I suppose in a little bit
01:00:21 I do but like I never feel like anyone needs to watch my content or owes me watching my content
01:00:26 or anything like that but you can tell when the conversation goes that way there's like a you
01:00:31 know there's like uh oh of course I've like seen some of your stuff I'm not even trying to show
01:00:35 and use then I just mean like I've noticed this over the years many times right and it's uh I don't
01:00:39 know like like right now I'm just like I have not watched Zen stuff in a while and I really like it so
01:00:44 I I should but like you know I it's almost kind of like a guilt thing I'm so sorry sir I please
01:00:51 forgive me a real a real fan would have watched uh insert fucking video name here yeah you don't
01:01:01 even know right exactly that's the thing shameful and it's like that's the thing about my content too
01:01:06 because it's literally whatever I want and that's true yeah I'm sort of uncapitalating in that sense
01:01:12 and you know that's probably not best in the business sense but uh it's a gratification on
01:01:17 what I'm making I love it it's a it's a grand old time I literally just release like two covers of
01:01:22 songs just cuz you know I have a second channel where I could have put it but the way I uh you
01:01:28 know choose what content to put on what channel is literally just a gut feeling I just look at the
01:01:32 video for three for three seconds and I'm like okay this channel or this channel and like there
01:01:38 there's no real distinction between the quality between the channels just like okay yeah uh I
01:01:44 just feel like it goes this way or this way it's like I love it you know it's like and I feel that
01:01:49 people subscribe for that experience just like oh it's a random grab bag what am I gonna get next
01:01:55 I went to I did a live stream where I just went to the museum of fine arts I was like okay hey
01:02:00 yeah that's all very good course stuff I think people who like who have stayed subs do you I mean
01:02:05 I don't know how uh how big you are now but you you're getting a pretty sizable following now yeah
01:02:08 and um it's uh I think those people definitely are on board for like the the eclectic zen experience
01:02:14 at this point so yeah so you you I think you've seemed to have really broken through any kind of
01:02:19 barrier like if there's people like a couple hundred subs and they upload like random stuff yeah I mean
01:02:23 I could certainly understand them thinking like uh geez if they've been doing it for a long time
01:02:27 what do I need to change but you I mean you seem well past that now so yeah I'm gonna make a I'm
01:02:31 gonna make a video on the world fair the 1964 world fair why that one I would I like I like I mean
01:02:39 that's I like that tell me tell me you tell me about that well I mean later yeah in the video
01:02:46 I don't want to follow too much because it ruined the incentive to come to the video but yeah yeah
01:02:50 okay yeah it doesn't to my knowledge it doesn't happen annually and um
01:02:56 um that's the one that uh come uh I caught wind of I don't know why exactly that one's important
01:03:03 but uh hey that's what research is for and that's what I'm going to do if we're calling like Disney
01:03:08 dates correctly that is relevant to Epcot I don't oh yeah that's it that's correct yes yes
01:03:16 did they like build Epcot for that or something well Epcot's well sort of kind of a little bit
01:03:22 in a roundabout way yes Epcot currently is sort of like a permanent world sphere because Walt was
01:03:26 always fascinated by them as a kid and and yeah okay so on and so forth I could go on all day about
01:03:32 Disney it doesn't matter here's a here's a slight left turn but not quite it's that uh hey Vapors
01:03:37 3 is out and I have read it oh my god sure why would you do that I I did it I did it and I mean
01:03:46 I don't know how much uh you would want to talk about I mean I would certainly encourage everyone
01:03:50 to go read it uh it's very in keeping with uh the Vapors style and uh a lot of great artwork
01:03:55 interested in magda focus story this time which is a magda chapter uh here's the thing about um
01:04:01 whenever I make anything I'm embarrassed about it instantly I put it out there I put it out there
01:04:09 and all I can think is like why did I do this you know I totally know what you mean it's like
01:04:16 it doesn't serve my own interest because I know that the thing to do is get out there and like start
01:04:21 talking about it and promoting it and pushing it but my instinct is to recoil away from it
01:04:26 as though in horror uh you know what I mean I totally get you and I think the problem is like
01:04:32 with somebody like me I have the advantage of my content being like a video thing that YouTube
01:04:37 just kind of helps me I don't have to go out and chill it really it just kind of you know
01:04:42 out there which is very convenient yours is a little bit different because you gotta
01:04:46 pound the pavement more and you gotta do something is magda just like rule 63 ben
01:04:52 they both are not entirely both Vincent and magda are both rule 63 ben ben I was very
01:04:58 think about it think about it I was I was really thinking about um uh Vapors in general after
01:05:04 reading that I was doing some reflection and I of course uh Vapors has always had a fairly um I'm
01:05:11 I'm not trying to say negative but like a fairly dark tone to it yeah I mean yeah everything about
01:05:16 like a desperation of their lives and I don't know things of that nature yeah yeah you could uh
01:05:23 you could say that I def I when I was reading this one I not only felt that that was the strongest
01:05:28 in uh in chapter three here uh and I I know was played for laughs but I felt a deep profound
01:05:36 like concern for magda's well-being yeah based on the events of this chapter and and you know what
01:05:42 like they're they're absolutely would have been a way for like these same events to be written in
01:05:46 the exact same way but to it to feel more light-hearted and like not serious but that really is not
01:05:52 what it's just not that's not what happens it felt deeply concerning about her state of mind
01:05:57 I've been all the things she went I've been thinking about this a bunch and I think yeah maybe
01:06:03 one way to describe the Vapors is like the opposite of a superhero story and that it is
01:06:08 stories about people of exceptionally low capacity just like people who are capable of the least
01:06:15 possible a super zero story yeah of course I could never tell you what to what to do with
01:06:24 the stories or anything but like the super relatable story yeah they are certainly relatable
01:06:31 although the thing magda goes into like almost it she's superhero level of incompetent at life
01:06:38 kind of and it is it is a sight to behold I think the fact that the entire chapter was like silent
01:06:44 like there was no dialogue really helped with the atmosphere that's kind of I mean um one and two are
01:06:50 largely like that as well the dialogue is really minimal there's there's no text maybe I mean I
01:06:56 I guess that's true but I mean I'm reading it now Mike magda always felt like like the sort of person
01:07:02 who like thinks in her head but it's like mostly nothing and then like there's nothing that she
01:07:09 thinks to say all the time she's a real cloudy head if you know what I'm saying look at her look at
01:07:13 her hair just like if somebody asked her a question she'd be like uh do I have to do I have an answer
01:07:19 to this I don't know doesn't seem to have a lot of self-confidence that's true um though you know
01:07:26 at the end of chapter two there's that moment and actually even at the end of chapter one
01:07:30 my my Nate senses gets so amped up to fucking 11 I get rock hard my veins bulged from my neck
01:07:38 when like for example at the end of chapter one Vincent goes to this event has a terrible time
01:07:43 but but he signed the form so he will be notified of future events I'm like yes a redemption is
01:07:49 he did it this character yes that's what I like to see motherfucker yeah I mean what's he gonna do
01:07:57 and maybe sign it he's fucking defeated he has no he's not defeated there's hope and then and then
01:08:02 chapter two he throws the book in the trash he has this horrible social experience because he's
01:08:06 got no competency but at the end he's reading the book again yes he didn't give up he can
01:08:11 got it he got it out he got it out of the trash he did that I'm like those moments of hope think
01:08:18 about it that's that's what I really I mean I love seeing the being such terrible pieces of shit
01:08:24 I love how he keeps on saying think about it think about it well that's just think about yeah well I
01:08:30 mean that's it that's all I want just think about it okay fair I but but in chapter three I'm glad
01:08:37 like I'm that is a super amped that you do think about that's all I want that's why I want people
01:08:44 to read it and just think about it think about it yeah but the difference with the end of three
01:08:50 it was good and I guess I won't go people should absolutely go read it but like it ends there's
01:08:54 there's no exactly the same kind of moment of like possible hope there although it does feel
01:09:01 like just kind of silly at the end which is good I'm glad the tone lightens a little at the end
01:09:05 so it gives me a similar kind of slight upbeat note at the end and I don't know the fact that magda
01:09:11 kind of overcame all the stuff in here that was kind of hopeful like wow this bitch can really walk
01:09:16 she can really walk she she really she really did it um I respect that uh well you know I mean
01:09:25 what choice did she have very well she you know when when faced with the possibility of like well
01:09:31 do I walk home or do I die in the streets she overcame she overcame I'll tell you what I'm
01:09:36 looking for Ben yeah I want to see in the future when it comes to the vapors I want to see more
01:09:42 magda not even necessarily like like winning at life but I want to see her strengths I want to
01:09:47 know what is going on in her head yeah because mostly it's been like she of course did drawing
01:09:51 stuff in in chapter one which I appreciated but like I want to know more about her her thoughts on
01:09:58 life aside from just her kind of general disposition um yeah that's well you know what I have what I
01:10:03 have to do now is I have to write a bunch of short um a bunch of short uh vaporette stories for uh
01:10:10 guest artists to draw for uh Kickstarter to for book two and I don't know what those are going to be
01:10:16 at all um uh they've got they've got parents I could have them like talk to their parents or
01:10:23 something I've been thinking about I don't know what they would say I don't know what the content
01:10:26 of that would be but that's like an aspect that's an interesting idea I haven't been really listening
01:10:31 but I have the mysteriousness of just these oh yeah I go on I just finished reading it uh I almost
01:10:37 did this exact thing in real life yeah yeah wait tell Elizabeth what do you mean tell me more uh
01:10:45 well it was yeah which thing it was like uh the the walking around aimlessly not knowing what to do
01:10:50 and then just walking all the way back home I was hoping I meant lying inert on the grass
01:10:56 not that stuff I mean I think I've done something like that before but like walk outside before and
01:11:02 like done things before and then walk no no no like walking to the point of like I've gone places
01:11:08 man I don't know what I'm doing I uh uh and then like yeah like yeah you know like uh same I get
01:11:21 that I get that like like you could maybe ask someone for directions or help but you're just
01:11:25 like no I don't want to interact with anyone I'm just uh well it's not even just that it's not even
01:11:29 just that I didn't know where I was going it was just that I had no direction in life literally
01:11:34 and I would walk oh I went I walked for a really long time and it was cold and it was terrible I
01:11:39 literally I literally guys I literally can't even um but I literally can't even uh like look at it
01:11:49 or think about it without feeling embarrassed or something yes it is nothing to pain for me to
01:11:54 constantly you know I think Ben all the things that I have done and made it's a small small point
01:11:59 but it's you know Ben I people always talk about how you know much they like my like
01:12:02 login reviews and stuff the fact of the matter is I have done like what five of my like big
01:12:09 staple videos like total in my entire video making thing yeah and frankly the ideas of making more
01:12:15 is extremely intimidating that I won't be able to like live up to it or that and releasing those
01:12:20 was always terrifying yeah and I remember when when Galco first came out um like I knew it was
01:12:26 like a less substantive overall video it and like people were like not I remember you these people
01:12:32 in this very call were not impressed with it I absolutely hated the Galco video yeah yeah and
01:12:38 and that's fine that's totally fine yeah but I just I have that same fear about like important
01:12:43 stuff I make and I think with it with both of us the more we make I think the more comfortable
01:12:49 will be just like well with it hasn't improved it hasn't gotten any better for me but that's my
01:12:55 point you haven't made that many maybe you if you get like five there's there was someone once said
01:13:01 that fear points true north and I thought that was an interesting fear points true north when it
01:13:06 comes to when it comes to creativity the thing you're most afraid of doing is definitely points
01:13:10 to our insecurities that's for sure I wait to elaborate on that I don't really I tell me if
01:13:15 this is right I think what you mean is that like um I mean I've heard this before that like if you're
01:13:20 afraid of something then like the thing to do that like that means you should do it like to grow as a
01:13:27 person or whatever yeah that was like the general idea of the quote that in the context they were
01:13:32 talking about like creativity and stuff is that like if you're afraid of doing something uh it's
01:13:37 it's the one like you're the most the most afraid of fucking it up because it's the one you're most
01:13:41 passionate about yeah hey give it I'll tell you I'll tell you what uh I actually do that that thing
01:13:47 where I just walk around aimlessly and I actually do it to my benefit because uh I'm I'm very much a
01:13:54 homebody so sometimes I'll just leave the house walk in any direction till I get lost right dude
01:14:00 it's fun I like that idea it's very fun I like that idea but like the time I was talking about is
01:14:05 right it was a bad time right it was a bad time in my life uh like uh bad like before even like
01:14:12 pony youtube this is like early early life like oh what do I do I'm gonna die I'm saying like do it
01:14:18 in a more neutral context it's great you get to see more of the city places you've never even seen
01:14:23 yeah I mean I I generally I generally I generally default to play pokemon go bro just play pokemon
01:14:28 go just literally just play pokemon go I mean I generally default to walking around rather than
01:14:34 getting transport because I don't like spending money and I think like my legs like could use the
01:14:40 exercises and it's free like it's better and for free so I'll walk it's an it's an hour's walk but
01:14:45 you know what I'll walk I'll have to walk back but that's fine I haven't talked to you in a while
01:14:50 and I just want to say that you stood me up you you you stood us up no I was broke and I'm here to
01:14:57 be funny I think I literally had two dollars in my bank account at that time there's no more embarrassing
01:15:03 excuse that I'm poor I hear people say this all the time just buy some money
01:15:11 mine's some crypto I don't understand the problem just mine some slime
01:15:16 yeah I don't have the diamond payback so I can I say me me Ben and Cassie we're on the prowl we were
01:15:22 gonna get happy lamb hot pot and we invited you we extended our we extended our hand to you and and
01:15:29 you first laughed away and you stabbed us in and and and you berated us you said why would ever
01:15:35 want to come out to have hot pot I hate Japan I remember that I did say that verbatim yeah
01:15:41 and I don't regret it actually yeah well you were you were right because that particular hot pot
01:15:47 was a shit show no no Ben no don't okay okay okay all right stop being an apology stop being an
01:15:52 apologist for happy lamb all right no no no no you must understand okay kaze was the shit hot pot
01:15:59 happy lamb is the good hot pot uh well whatever well whatever the first one the first one okay
01:16:05 me and ben went to a hot pot place it it sucked and the entire time ben was like oh I hate this hey
01:16:10 waitress hey toots come over here let me grab your ass I fucking hate you and and and she was like yes
01:16:16 sir yes sir I'm sorry sir and she was like oh fuck you and then he started pounding his desk saying
01:16:22 baby what bop bop baby went bop bop hey hey and and then and then he like he like jumped up on the
01:16:28 table he started banging his chest he leaped over to the next table ever he said hey eat the smallest
01:16:33 eat this muscle eat this $12 muscles marinara hey what a good deal let's go to Whole Foods next
01:16:40 let's get a good deal on some nuts yeah it was pearls before swine really oh was it Ben Ben Ben
01:16:47 it was terrible scallop was the one that scallop was the one good thing yeah that's why I meant the
01:16:53 scallop he was he was trying to use the forest and people to eat scallops against their will left
01:16:56 scallops right just like this is like how ben did the 180 uh when I came up like what like three weeks
01:17:03 ago when you specifically told told ben that it was an hour earlier to meet up than we actually
01:17:09 were going to assuming he was going to be late and then he woke up right when we were supposed
01:17:15 to be there and didn't even come to the uh to fire nice for you because munchie told me that you
01:17:20 guys were like already leaving I said that I was already I was like I was like I was like a little
01:17:27 bit late and I was like a little bit late yeah like that's like less than an hour and I was like hey
01:17:32 should you get should I still come and you were like nah we're already eating we're basically done
01:17:36 and then like four hours later you get to my house we did we did well wait this is not the
01:17:43 story how I was told munchie told me that he said to you we're meeting at 11 yes and that's yeah
01:17:50 no no I was I was like but we were actually but I could have still come the thing is we were actually
01:17:55 meeting at 12 he told you an hour earlier assuming you were going to be late no exactly that just
01:18:01 makes it worse because then it was like 12 and I was like should I come and he was like no it's
01:18:06 like two hours away from you I didn't think that you would want to do that you hung out for like
01:18:11 four more hours before you got to my house you told me this is vastly inaccurate most of that was
01:18:17 uber time because we got stuck in traffic in uber oh you're a fucker but but but you didn't
01:18:23 why am I a fucker because you lied to me what did I lie about you betrayed me well I did like you
01:18:32 saying to get there earlier than you were supposed to yeah and you didn't accomplish that I did I
01:18:37 know what what's the point of telling me to come an hour early and then so when I'm an hour late
01:18:44 and therefore on time you're like nah it's too late don't show up that's technically not on time if
01:18:49 the idea is to me yes at that time yes that's not on time at all you know but the point was that you
01:18:56 were just rolling out of bed and you were rolling out of bed an hour after you were like you thought
01:19:01 the time was supposed to be listen that's all fine that's that happened whatever I was at that point
01:19:09 at that point there was a choice at that point there was a choice to be made do I still come
01:19:15 and the right answer was yes but you told me no you did not care about your facts yeah that's
01:19:23 right I was I was going to say though that Ben Ben turned the day around because he was making
01:19:28 keto donuts and they were made those keto donuts and they were meat flavor and they were protein
01:19:33 flavored yeah okay I'm sourd forever a happy ending the black the blackberry ones were an experiment
01:19:40 and it failed and I and I and I copped to that I respect the effort though yes by the way I'm
01:19:46 enjoying this image that zen posted in the chat that I'm assuming your dad sense no I don't know
01:19:52 who that is no you don't know who it is no no I know Steve I don't know who sent me the
01:19:58 picture oh okay so wait Steve Aoki isn't your dad I'm confused now I'm getting lost in the story
01:20:05 put that where's where's the other people which chatter is in general general general yes
01:20:15 well when it comes to art block I mean yeah the the only thing I have is whenever I oh actually
01:20:19 we're talking about this before but it's like whenever I am stuck and I don't know what to do
01:20:24 I simply try to to find the smallest possible atomic version like step forward on whatever
01:20:32 the project is and I find that once I am in the mode where I do that one thing that's super easy
01:20:38 the next thing just is much easier in general so that's that's my yes I mean there's there's all
01:20:43 this sort of like just do it a sort of helpful advice that I that I hear um but you know all of
01:20:52 it horse shit all of it horse shit I think my point is a little more nuanced well no here's here's
01:20:58 the thing I was thinking about though um I I was getting on like from this from this uh
01:21:04 annoyance that I can't be bothered to like work as hard as I would like to I was getting on like
01:21:10 oh depression and then also um thinking about like uh what I want to do with my life maybe I
01:21:19 don't even like comics maybe I don't even like drawing maybe blah blah blah this like all stupid
01:21:24 shit that has no actual basis and it's just me being frustrated um that's a real and it is real
01:21:31 shit but I was thinking like the the the way that motivation like comes about is as a result of
01:21:40 something going well like you do something and you don't think much of it and if it goes well
01:21:45 then you're motivated by that to continue doing it and I guess I just feel like comics bail jpeh
01:21:53 it was good but for some reason it doesn't feel like it was a good like idea to I mean it was nice
01:22:00 that I finished it you know I know what you mean that scathing review I gave you last pcp where I
01:22:05 said it wasn't the best comic in the world and he said he he he's his hand quit around his
01:22:11 stylus and cracked in an ass so sorry so sorry tablet but like I mean it was mostly my own
01:22:18 thoughts about it and then it was I was asking people in my discord uh or rather like they
01:22:24 read the watch the pcp and heard that I wanted more criticism and they gave me criticism I was
01:22:29 like yes I agree with all these things and that's true and I was thinking like yeah that's good and
01:22:34 the fact that the the punk Kickstarter is like I know it's an inexpensive plush and not everybody
01:22:38 has the money but if it was popular it would just work it would just you know there would be
01:22:43 more fans if it was more I suppose like more marketable or I was better at spreading the word
01:22:49 or just it was if it was like from the beginning if it was like nicer to look at because the first
01:22:55 few panels are like complete shit and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere it's like that was the
01:23:00 nature of its creation that I didn't care about it initially and then it it sort of grew from
01:23:06 you know a very small thing but it's certainly got more impressive in it makes it difficult to
01:23:11 get into it I think punk is great but I mean I have put my money down on a plush I want everyone
01:23:17 go give money to the same fucking make it it it would start to be over by the time this comes out
01:23:22 or with the I think it will be over I don't know maybe maybe like a day just go check just go check
01:23:28 it I think there's like a day I think there'll be like a day or two left when this comes out
01:23:32 but um give not to be pessimistic but if it doesn't work out is it possible to do one
01:23:38 like of a smaller scale that would also make the plush real because I still want the damn plush
01:23:42 no matter what happens um I have been thinking about that the the possibility like what was
01:23:48 what's the cost now is it like it's like 50 right like six grand or something is that including
01:23:54 delivery uh well I just know that your kickstarter asks for something oh no no like
01:23:59 individually like what what the like 40 bucks 40 to 50 I think something like that like 50 something
01:24:06 if I scaled it back to like I don't know 50 plushes because there's like 50 people already
01:24:11 that want them or at least 50 backers so like potentially I could get 50 people again but
01:24:17 that would mean the plush would be like a hundred and something dollars plus shipping oh which would
01:24:23 which would like reduce the amount of people and then I won't probably won't even get 50
01:24:28 and then it would just be the same thing again I'm not sure okay okay but nonetheless people
01:24:33 go fucking pledge please help me get my plush yeah I put my money down god damn it I deserve a plush
01:24:39 do it for me do it for Nate Nate deserves his pump plush that's what I want beautiful but guys
01:24:46 it is just sort of a thing like seeing it not succeed sort of confirms my suspicions that it's
01:24:52 not that big I mean obviously I knew that it wasn't huge but it doesn't feel like it doesn't
01:24:58 motivate me to continue making comics not that I'm gonna stop but it's difficult now to like
01:25:04 I thought it wouldn't affect me the Kickstarter not working I thought I had like in my head
01:25:08 oh you know maybe it works maybe it doesn't doesn't matter I'll keep working and then I suddenly
01:25:12 find myself that I don't want to work and I thought it might be related to Kickstarter when
01:25:16 you started on this topic but when the when the PCP Kickstarter was going and you guys know I mean
01:25:20 we were all heavily invested in that I was worked a lot on getting that going I was terrified
01:25:27 dude we all were I was fucking worried I was just like I was like oh my god if this fail like
01:25:32 I'm just gonna feel like such a failure and feel so bad but the reality is like even if it hadn't
01:25:38 say I mean it vastly like doubled what we wanted to get you know due to the stretch goals and stuff
01:25:42 and that was great but even if it had failed I mean it's always scary because like you have a
01:25:47 vague idea of like how big your audience is and how much they're invested but like you never have
01:25:51 the exact amount or otherwise you you wouldn't be scared so it's like every time you go into
01:25:56 that venture of starting to kickstart it's like what's gonna happen but but you know like your
01:26:02 Kickstarter and Kickstarter is in general like obviously it's not like oh it's either you succeed
01:26:07 and you win or you fail and like now you're shit and everything you've done is bad yeah I mean it
01:26:12 shows you the real life the real situation that like you know there's currently a little bit less
01:26:17 people willing to put down money on it and that's just a good reality to be aware of
01:26:21 and like I mean I was just thinking I was thinking of this before like I was thinking that like
01:26:26 maybe this is one of your like ms paint adventures now deleted and homestuck.com but like maybe this
01:26:33 is like your I don't know what was the thing before before problem sleuth barred quest jail
01:26:40 and jail or whatever and I just I mean I I've been filled with hope and like Gibb's really done
01:26:46 cool comic stuff here I can't wait to see what he's gonna do next time I bet it'll be even better
01:26:50 and even cooler it is so if I may have the floor for a moment hippo I know you're a smart guy and I
01:26:55 sure you've thought about this before so I speak now purely for the audience's sake but you say
01:27:01 at the beginning of the conversation that you're making you know you're writing you're doing character
01:27:05 layouts is not the point of bail jpeg just that you were supposed to fly by the sea of your handle
01:27:11 by the by the by the seat of your pants by the pants of your pants not very but very marketable I
01:27:16 suppose I mean that's that's very slapdash and not very uh but possibly you know impressive
01:27:22 but that was the point that you were supposed to you know just kind of get it done and I just
01:27:27 want to say that you may want to you know increase the marketability may want to increase the overall
01:27:33 popularity of it for purely like a non you know oh great you are bad optic scenarios just you know
01:27:38 you want people to enjoy the art you create and you want people to be happy with the stuff that
01:27:42 you make and I think those are noble and fine but I just there's no reason to make a comic unless
01:27:49 you want to make a comic you do not have to rely on jail babe for your for your patreon you don't
01:27:56 have to rely on those comics to be to have a house over your head they are just purely nice and maybe
01:28:01 you want to make a career out of it and that's a different story but if you are having such a hard
01:28:06 time making a comic then we will probably see that in the result and I don't know if that's
01:28:11 necessarily something that just needs to happen you know well it's it's it's it's I don't know
01:28:19 whether it's that I don't want to work on it it's just that I find myself not you know I wake up
01:28:26 and then I watch youtube videos for a really long time and I just don't give myself a time
01:28:33 like um I mean I'm always like this even with things that I do like this is when schedules come
01:28:38 in handy because I actually also make comics and uh you know I also spend a lot of time on youtube
01:28:45 and I cut down by making schedules and adhering to it and punishing myself if I don't physically I
01:28:51 know Zen's a big schedule guy right like like with the cat and I entails no I hit myself I I think
01:28:56 yeah well no I mean I it's not I'm not Jesus Christ you by yourself yeah I just cut myself
01:29:07 with a claymore you cut yourself into pieces it's your last resort I decided to hang a literal
01:29:15 sort of Damocles above my head no but but seriously it's like night and day when you
01:29:20 apply a schedule and actually adhere to it and like make the effort to you know
01:29:24 follow the it's so hard for me to upstick to schedules though because no one's enforcing it
01:29:28 but me and I'm a oh yeah that's the thing tell us you I want to hear about zen's like enforcement
01:29:33 measures and what what how does that work for you what do you do with that what do I do well yeah
01:29:38 like if you fuck up what do you do okay so uh one is like the I do physical repercussions right
01:29:46 and then second of all uh there are things that I like right like um there are four can relate
01:29:55 they're like foods that I like or sometimes I'll I'll often go to the store to get candy and like
01:30:00 if I don't do something if I if I don't stop within like if I go like 20 minutes over right
01:30:06 right like I'm watching YouTube like two hours or something but I go two hours and 20 minutes
01:30:11 instead well I won't go to the store to buy the candy or I won't make myself that pizza you know
01:30:16 because it's like stuff like that that's and it's like the trouble the trouble there but yeah the
01:30:23 trouble there is you know finding something that you care about to the point that you know it's like
01:30:29 this is actually it'll actually motivate you to do yeah exactly what what I find I mean this could
01:30:34 just be maybe a lack of discipline on my part but I find that like actively trying to like just like
01:30:42 destroy yourself doesn't motivate me in the same way that it might for you I feel like everyone
01:30:47 gets motivated differently and and punishments don't work for me but what does work for me
01:30:52 is just removing as many options as possible so instead of punishing myself for doing something
01:30:58 bad I just will set up my life in a way where I can't do bad things and so it's not a question of
01:31:04 will or I want I and if I do something bad then I have to punish myself it's it's a matter of oh
01:31:10 there is no option here because either the easiest option is to do something that's beneficial to
01:31:15 me and productive or it's not the most easiest solution but it's the only solution that is
01:31:20 available to me for instance a perfect example right now I was fiddling around with my schedule
01:31:26 and and and my and my auto blocker that blocks various application on my computer and I messed
01:31:30 up so right now I'm recording my laptop right now and not on my desktop like I would because I
01:31:35 literally locked myself out of my desktop and I cannot access it anymore because I misclicked
01:31:41 and I literally like that's one of the functions I employ every single day as my computer will
01:31:45 auto turn off at various points in the day okay right it's like whenever I'm doing something like
01:31:52 essay or something like that I'll just turn off the wi-fi on my computer yeah man I tried that once
01:31:58 one time I tried like shutting my my internet off and it worked really well for getting me to do
01:32:03 stuff it yeah I mean it works really well until until you realize I mean when I'm drawing stuff
01:32:09 I'm like oh I need a reference I gotta turn it back on and then I forget to turn it off
01:32:15 oh it's always just a fucking nightmare like I I mean I tried the youtube challenge
01:32:21 the hashtag youtube challenge of like not watching youtube ever ever again and I completely failed
01:32:29 but you know and I'm back on I'm back on you know look at watching like multi hour videos every day
01:32:36 and I mean they're fun videos and they're sort of background videos and I can play a game at the
01:32:41 same time but I'm not working at like it's it's really just I'm wondering if that that whole thing
01:32:49 just ultimately doesn't work but what does work is you know a good thing that I'm doing is like
01:32:57 going along like getting getting the motivation like I was saying it it comes from a success it
01:33:02 doesn't even need to be like I put it out and people like it it's that I drew something good
01:33:07 and it's good so I'm motivated to to continue working on the thing getting started on anything new
01:33:13 is so difficult because you have to make the initial good thing like if I do a sketch or like
01:33:20 or if I think of like a really cool way of the story could go then it won't matter how much many
01:33:26 distractions are in front of me I will want to be doing the thing because it's so cool in my in my
01:33:31 head and I'm like I gotta do this at the moment though it's just sort of like I've got lots of
01:33:35 ideas that could be good but I don't know whether any of them are going to be good and I'm just
01:33:40 sort of like avoiding starting the only way to know is to try though which I'm sure you know
01:33:46 so like I've just been feeling stupid for a few days and I'm usually a few days is all it takes
01:33:51 for me to like finally be like no no more video games and then I try and it it works for me it
01:34:01 so often it just like it always it always gets preceded by me feeling like a depressed idiot for
01:34:06 a few you know I must have said this on the podcast before so please stop me if I if I repeat this
01:34:11 exact same line before but making a schedule is creating the perfect harness for yourself that
01:34:17 is not it does not cut too close to your skin you want to shear the sheep not to skin it so you
01:34:22 want to make it you want to make a harness around yourself that you know enables you to be productive
01:34:27 and direct you towards a path but also isn't too heavy that it makes you pissed off and want to
01:34:32 die and piss and shit that's true that's very true it's called it's all part of the setting
01:34:38 appropriate goals or setting realistic goals for yourself and if you say like just for example if
01:34:43 you are a new youtuber and you say uh just like you've never done it before I want to hit a million
01:34:48 subs by the end of the year like that goal is is purely unhelpful now it's so stupid because there
01:34:54 can be some things about that and people have done this before but you're setting your sights in the
01:35:00 wrong way you need to be way more specific and way more I don't know have a plan and I so I linked
01:35:06 a video setting fitness goals by my hero scooby 1961 he's got a whole okay this guy is my favorite
01:35:12 person in the world he taught me everything about fitness that I know but beyond that he is a he was
01:35:17 he is a successful retired engineer who is let's just say extremely financially secure
01:35:23 and uh he uh he retired at age like 50 or 60 or something just so he could he was doing his online
01:35:30 youtube stuff yeah he's this guy is he is one of my favorite people on the planet uh he's a hero
01:35:38 and by the way all yeah all his fitness tools he so he has made he like I said he's a software engineer
01:35:44 he makes many fitness tools he releases them for free to the public to be used by anyone
01:35:50 surely because he wants everyone to be able to benefit the way he has from fitness uh and to be
01:35:56 able to like you know work on their goals and stuff it like to anybody who follows this guy you
01:35:59 know what I'm talking about okay but specifically this video is part two of his of his series on
01:36:06 setting good fitness goals but it applies to any goal at all so everybody you should watch it
01:36:11 and the rest of the series because like setting goals in appropriately it's it's not just like I
01:36:17 was saying before there are many ways to gauge if a goal is good or bad there's an acronym I cannot
01:36:24 remember what it is right now it's like there's like four criteria and it's like measurable uh time
01:36:29 bounded uh like not doing too much there's like words for it but like all those should be frankly
01:36:37 if everyone's at work like optimally you should have those goals for like basically
01:36:42 everything you're doing in life absolutely no no I'm totally with you yeah like the word of the
01:36:47 day for me all the time is compartmentalization it's like yeah break it up into smaller more
01:36:52 consumable chunks for you to understand and then the ostensibly daunting task just becomes a cake
01:36:59 well not a cakewalk but you know you know something plausible that can actually be done by you
01:37:03 absolutely during during me a math of a two I had a big backlog excuse me building up of
01:37:08 things that I needed to do I simply couldn't do uh because I was too busy doing videos and stuff
01:37:13 and now now that it's done I've been going through them one by one checking them off I've got a I've
01:37:18 got a huge list of individual small tasks and I gotta say I don't know if everybody else feels
01:37:23 the same way it feels so fucking good to one by one put my big done sign next to each of those
01:37:29 tasks and soon I'm gonna have a big fucking list with nothing but guns and I'm gonna be an
01:37:34 accomplished heroic individual and I can't wait it's so exciting this is the not this is the
01:37:39 number one arc in my life that's giving me excitement and I can't wait to be done but
01:37:43 go back to your to your new comic and stuff like that again I would just say I mean I don't know
01:37:49 I don't even know if anyone else feels this way but again comics aren't what define you they aren't
01:37:55 they don't have to be you're like a new thing oh god hey everyone the hey everyone in the village
01:38:01 come over hippo crits doing comics now this is what he does now ha hey new comic please ha hippo
01:38:07 please new comic that's not what's happening right now you don't have to be be held into really
01:38:12 any standards I am in me and you are somewhat similar though you have a uh a different uh history
01:38:19 but like our incomes are not online really uh or yours you you have like a writing job that
01:38:27 assumably is like a job that sustains you correct uh yeah pretty much so you don't have to do anything
01:38:36 you don't have I know I I was thinking about this it nobody has to do anything nobody has to
01:38:43 die with with money that's not what I mean you can just you can just homestead your whole life
01:38:49 you can just go live in the woods the thing is I don't like I don't really care about um making
01:38:56 comics a career I would just like to have a few because I have some in my head well that's a great
01:39:03 reason to do it that's a great reason and I'm not saying don't do it I'm just saying like I know
01:39:08 what how it is to have people expect things from you and when it's your career you know you got to
01:39:12 do it but yeah like when you literally promise a comic four years you know that's you know it
01:39:18 could happen you can find yourself in that situation I mean I mean yeah I've done that exact same thing
01:39:22 and I mean I I haven't talked about explicitly for literal years because I I have not I've not
01:39:28 once brought it up in like a very very very long time because I'm not doing it duh I mean how could
01:39:35 you think I possibly still would be after all these years you'd have to be insane yikes well now they
01:39:41 know that they already mean now they know that's not a revelation yeah well I mean that's true anyway
01:39:48 I decided that I mean I don't have any want to do comics really the the thing that was animations
01:39:57 pathetic like I feel this this you know some sort of like kicking the butt of my of my own self
01:40:07 to get started on it rather than to just wait until I feel like it because that never really comes is
01:40:14 is just because I think it's nice to have something going on like it's it's nice to have a project
01:40:24 that I'm working on if I wasn't thinking of writing a new comic I would be doing nothing really
01:40:29 and aside from like the the writing thing which is like it's not insubstantial amount of work
01:40:35 and I do enjoy that as well but it feels very separate from like internet online things and I
01:40:42 know I don't have to make a comic I don't even think people are that interested in the next
01:40:46 comic I make maybe a few people are well you got to get us interested of course you know yeah I mean
01:40:51 I've got to get me interested in it that's that's indeed I don't say what I say to promote laziness
01:40:57 or to say like oh you know like don't worry about just you know you just don't try and do anything
01:41:01 that's obviously not what I'm trying to say yeah you are you know that's what I'm saying that's what
01:41:07 I'm telling you mom position uh which is fine which is a totally appropriate one but I'm advocating
01:41:12 the dad position uh human beings are beasts of burden and I very much believe that we do better
01:41:17 when we have tasks assigned to us so well it's totally it's totally well he has but but as he's
01:41:23 saying he's not that's not enough he's not satisfied if he didn't want to do it anymore
01:41:28 that's totally fine but I mean I would absolutely advocate that like you shouldn't just always I mean
01:41:35 I'm not saying Gibb thinks this but just in general like uh one shouldn't always like feel that when
01:41:41 there are things that you know raise obstacles and I know Mudgey isn't saying this either but
01:41:46 but just to state the general point when when obstacles arise and you feel uncomfortable
01:41:51 the answer isn't necessarily to shy away sometimes it can be to rise and overcome that fear we'd all
01:41:56 agree on points true north right we talked about that pretty much pretty much so uh so yeah so like
01:42:02 sometimes in Gibb's situation I based on what he said it seems like he does have at least a interest
01:42:08 in making comics so I would say you know whatever like try things power through etc find the solution
01:42:14 all that bullshit you know you know yeah so if you have ideas for a comic I would be more than
01:42:20 happy to see because because I like your so even if the idea is to make a comic like you did before
01:42:24 where it's just like you know just literally make it up as you go I because that's great that's that's
01:42:28 just like my problem is not uh no you go ahead I was gonna say if um if you have a couple ideas
01:42:35 and you don't know which one you want to do like you can always just start doing them and not post
01:42:39 them like if you want to just do like the first couple pages of each idea privately and be like
01:42:45 if this isn't clicking for me then you don't have to like risk starting it putting it out there and
01:42:49 then my my my brain is like not set on any of this exactly I bring it up because the the problem
01:42:56 at the moment is that I feel like I have no direction and no motivation and no passion for
01:43:00 anything and so the to try and make one of these things that I have ideas for will hopefully give
01:43:07 me a purpose and then I will continue doing that but but you know though Gibb it's it's interesting
01:43:11 because this is actually exactly I mean it sounds to me like you're a little bit down about the
01:43:15 Kickstarter which is totally understandable one of the things that Scooby says I mean you know
01:43:20 this is a very well said just this is where I heard it is like well like when you set yourself
01:43:24 with expectations that are too high and like frankly like you asked for more money for your
01:43:29 a pump Kickstarter uh and of course they get a more tangible thing of like the the thing
01:43:33 than like we even did with Radcon and I mean just doing the math that's like uh like with all of us
01:43:38 involved who are at Radcon we we were able to drum up a lot of money all our combined efforts
01:43:44 and for you to do it on your own to ask for I mean we made like 9,000 I'm not saying that's a
01:43:49 tall order I already be demoralizing if you don't reach a goal yeah you know I I did know going
01:43:54 into it that it would be a quite a big ask and I wasn't expecting it to do well obviously not
01:43:59 trying to be amazing I mean it's it's it's just the reality of like how much the thing costs to
01:44:04 make yeah like like you said on the thing like you're not out you're not trying to make money
01:44:07 like those just this is what it's this is what it's gonna cost to turn this thing into a physical
01:44:14 product which uh yeah I mean I was making t-shirts it would be easy but t-shirts aren't as cool
01:44:22 can I can I ask uh like what's like like how do you want to talk about like how you arrived at
01:44:28 the number like what's the arithmetic behind it uh I detail that in the Kickstarter description
01:44:35 uh okay yeah there's the there's the there's the base cost of like manufacturing the things and then
01:44:41 them sending it to me so it's delivery cost and manufacturing costs then uh it is uh the customs
01:44:49 import tax that I will be charged with once I receive it and then uh what else is it oh yeah
01:44:57 and then there's five percent Kickstarter fee on top of whatever the big number is right right and
01:45:02 shipping really fucked us with ride con three that was like a big expense I mean on on the Kickstarter
01:45:07 like you you input the thing and then you say where you're from and then that uh the amount that is
01:45:13 delivery cost I calculated how much it would cost to send something that that size and that
01:45:18 weight and uh it's about ten dollars for america so that's yeah ten ten bucks plus on top of however
01:45:26 much it is divided by 150 uh and then that's how I came to the thing so it's like uh yeah I could
01:45:35 I could like I was thinking like I know this is not like literally allowed in Kickstarter
01:45:41 but I was like thinking if it gets pretty close but it's like a couple hundred uh just off you know
01:45:47 off the mark I was considering just like paying through some account for the rest of it yeah
01:45:54 yeah you can do that well what what is Kickstarter gonna gonna get mad that you contributed more
01:45:59 money to the campaign that they skim off the top of no yeah I don't know but um yeah I don't know
01:46:05 if there's a rule I'm not I'm not really down for like putting like more than half which is where it
01:46:10 is at the moment yeah yeah for sure for sure that's a big chunk of change I I I just want to say
01:46:16 just at the end here just say the reason I say all that I say is simply that to say don't make
01:46:22 shit art just because you feel like you have to because I don't want to read bad things so don't
01:46:26 make a bad thing they don't want to oh no I feel that and there yeah okay it's just like you were
01:46:33 saying I you don't really feel motivation and a lot of time I don't feel motivation too until like
01:46:37 it's a really an opportune time to have motivation because I can't write down the idea and I forget
01:46:42 it like you know when I'm I'm in bed or in a shower so I always have a notepad next to me you
01:46:48 know so it's like I can write it down and this isn't necessarily to you because this might not
01:46:52 be the case to you but so I'm just talking in general so it's like yeah I just always have
01:46:56 something that you can write something down on even if you're sleepy and it's like you have to
01:47:01 you sort of have to um what's what's the word not domesticate uh you have to uh uh discipline
01:47:12 yourself to to do it you have to be really tired you'll be like uh it's a good idea but I don't
01:47:22 want to write it out you have to do it you just have to do it I have definitely ruined my sleep
01:47:28 when I had sort of a cool idea and I was like I gotta I gotta write that down I turned my phone on
01:47:34 the light blinds me and then I have no eyeballs but then I type it down in like a google doc
01:47:39 that's literally how I made my first youtube video yeah it was like it was like 12 o'clock
01:47:43 in the morning and I stayed up for seven hours because I never edited before and I made a video
01:47:48 okay this is this is how much joy in the square feels me with every single day of my life this is
01:47:53 how much like creative juices are flowing when I work on that shit because every single day I'll
01:47:58 code a little bit and then I'll write a little bit and then I'll get into bed and then I'll think
01:48:02 myself oh dude what if like just to myself over and over again like dude what if just like just
01:48:08 constantly thinking of ideas and then it gets a brilliant point where I think I gotta write all
01:48:12 this down and I just I just get on like a google doc for like five hours make a ton of shit yeah
01:48:17 feels so good feels great that's great you know what felt that I had like a big like typing of a
01:48:24 type storm the other day did you made his video like why I play games and I was like oh dude I love
01:48:30 thinking about that I love like um thinking about why I like things and so I try to figure out why I
01:48:37 like playing games and I typed in a notepad document like for like 20 minutes straight like
01:48:43 as in like that my my fingers were not leaving the keyboard to think I was just like so much
01:48:49 info is like getting like put to paper and it felt great uh but it was like spelling errors and
01:48:55 like really disorganizes like good thing I'm not a youtuber anymore because this would be a nightmare
01:49:00 to like go through and make into something presentable there there are days where writing
01:49:05 feels so fucking hard for me but then the days just like spontaneously having words just words
01:49:10 flow from your fingers ah oh yeah that was me last night I started writing a script like in bed on
01:49:17 my phone for a video and it was like three pages worth of stuff just on a tiny little phone screen
01:49:23 and like why am I still going I should be sleeping right now it's weird when it just like hits you
01:49:28 hey hey hey ben I've got a request for you what I got a request that I've been thinking about like
01:49:32 for like like a month now sorry I was I was just I was just thinking about the shiny teeth song
01:49:37 from fairly odd parents and I was and I and I almost started crying uh but go on
01:49:50 just like a christmas tree uh chip skylark just like the stars in space do you know that he was
01:49:55 voiced by one of the members of in sync I'm really uh yeah yeah that doesn't shock me joey
01:50:01 something I think joey trubion joey salads yeah that sounds right is that a real person yeah yeah
01:50:09 yeah he's a youtuber well he's a youtuber okay so not his real name is uh joey saladino but uh
01:50:15 joey salads i like salads i like salads youtubers aren't real people but anyway what munchie what I
01:50:20 I've been thinking about this I want you to make a shirt ben I want you to make a shirt
01:50:24 of wanting to make a vapor shirt hey I can do that all right here's what I want it's you know
01:50:28 there was a vapor there was a vapor shirt it was available through print all over me and it was
01:50:32 a disaster really all over me is a nightmare yeah it was like the it was the cover like the entire
01:50:39 shirt was an all over print of the cover of the first one but print all over me just fucked it up
01:50:44 and like I saw one I saw one that was made there were like like three people bought them and I saw
01:50:50 one in real life and I was like I regret it so bad I feel so sorry for everyone who bought one
01:50:55 he just thought of the shirts and he almost cried I I want you it's very specific I want you okay
01:51:01 okay I want you to take the it's vapor you churl that panel put it on t-shirt but specifically
01:51:07 remove the white from it so it's just the black outline so we're gonna put on an off white like
01:51:10 beige t-shirt and then I'll buy it that sounds awful no it sounds great does it not not like
01:51:18 like like oh like oh like oh like a cardboard a little bit of a cardboard color hey benny boy

01:51:50 you know well I like I started I started thinking about the shiny teeth song and
01:51:59 shall we head to voicemailings that's how I think it's time I think it's time all right
01:52:04 ladies and gentlemen speak pipe link below leave us some voicemail messages and we they're good
01:52:09 we will play them so let's see we all they all they all know that they can be bad and still get
01:52:14 played they all know it Nate no no no no no no no that's a rumor there's no evidence
01:52:22 before we start voicemails I want to I want to point out something funny about the voicemails
01:52:27 in a medicine I went to speak pipe the website a couple days ago because I wanted to start a
01:52:32 speak pipe to help with the community show that I want to do for my patreon the free plan doesn't
01:52:38 exist anymore I have no idea how we're out paying for the money wait what doesn't exist anymore the
01:52:44 free plan for speak pipe doesn't exist anymore it's only on the wire lads so I have no idea how
01:52:50 they're not charging us for this yet but uh there you go yeah you know the weird thing is when with
01:52:56 speak pipe there is a limit to the number of voices I think it was like like 50 or something
01:53:00 it's like 50 a month and we do way past that and they've never charged us yeah we haven't
01:53:05 been charged is there is there someone is there someone else is getting charged and they just
01:53:09 don't know what's going on I hope so we're by the way I know exactly what number we're up to or
01:53:15 okay we like the messages we're up to we're up to we've had over 1068 before this meeting we had
01:53:22 exactly 1068 messages that was the last one before I started uh get the voicemails this time
01:53:28 fascinating fascinating 999 and uh the shit ones that were not played ever no no no okay look guys
01:53:36 this whole meme of lack of quality it's it's a lie and I'm gonna prove it to you right now
01:53:41 we've got a voicemail from my hero he's called you know you know it's fucking true let's let's let's
01:53:48 give him a chance to clear the floor here we go is this quality women back back at it again
01:53:53 no not yet let's let's go go hey um do you ever feel like straight guys who haven't at least
01:54:03 tried to suck a cock are um just fucking cowards
01:54:10 that's the whole voicemail I tell you that's the whole voicemail the fact that you are the only
01:54:15 person laughing it's true they are cowards it is absolutely cowardice I'm so with this guy
01:54:26 it's cowardice I've tried to suck my own sexuality's on a spectrum it's try to suck your own in the
01:54:34 abstract like like legitimately like sucking dick like isn't like actually the worst thing that could
01:54:39 happen to someone like in the abstract like sucking a cock I could probably do it it wouldn't be that
01:54:44 bad honestly sure uh well I mean that's true it wouldn't be like a painful experience might be
01:54:50 unpleasant I would rather I would rather enjoy a delicious meal with friends well I mean it's the
01:54:56 rest of it for me the only reason the only reason I wouldn't suck a dick is because I wouldn't want
01:55:01 to give the person the satisfaction sure like if it was just a floating dick with no person attached
01:55:07 like yeah sure why not yeah okay who won't tell who tell tales of your of your back room antics
01:55:13 you know I want a little privacy in my interaction I don't know I really don't have to be convinced it
01:55:17 genuinely does not strike me is like that bad like yeah like whatever I just suck a dick it's not
01:55:23 into the world sure that's fucking gay yes it is I guess it's like I guess the implication is like
01:55:28 oh what do you do with your with yourself and like your sexual identity after that are you gay now
01:55:35 but not yeah yeah it's just someone's like finger but it has a dick on it why would you put someone's
01:55:41 finger you know I feel like that's even worse uh I'm gonna give everyone look I think look we give
01:55:49 women a pass for like messing around with other women like in college that's like a meme I'm I'm
01:55:54 officially going on the record I'm giving guys one gay sex pass if you want to try it out to see how
01:56:00 it goes and then afterward you say that like it wasn't for me you're very you're very pro this

01:56:10 glad that the arbiter of gay experiences has given us one gay pass thank you Nick thank you

01:58:34 voicemail can I get a one in the chef quality women no can I get a one in the job no no okay so
01:58:40 I'm calling back just uh okay just a little update here set to explain myself so uh my highly
01:58:45 controversial voicemail yeah I'm saying that only eight out of ten and above women are uh okay that
01:58:52 was that was bullshit that was a stupid thing I think what I what I meant what I really meant
01:58:56 to say which is actually could be even more offensive and uh oh oh oh munchie oh munchie
01:59:02 you're gonna get offended you're gonna whitenight me a little bitch here we go okay so I think what I
01:59:07 meant what I meant to say what I really was feeling inside is uh I I can I can fucking
01:59:14 tolerate an eight out of ten or above I can tolerate your craziness more because it's like
01:59:18 oh because you're it's like you're fucking hotter you know it's like why should bitch I'm not going
01:59:22 to tolerate your craziness if you're below eight dog just walked in you know I'm saying like if
01:59:30 you're an eight and below like your dog why would I tolerate your fucking craziness if you're a 10
01:59:35 you know you could tolerate a 10 out of 10s craziness more because they're fucking wicked hot
01:59:39 you know so I think uh I think that's what I really know is this more we're not fucking anymore
01:59:43 she uh he kind of hates me now she said she was thinking of never talking to me again good yeah
01:59:47 she's seeing a therapist now and uh yeah we're just kind of we haven't fucked in like two or three weeks
01:59:53 so well great oh let's hear it let's hear it wait is is this the guy who was like uh he was
01:59:59 breaking up but he was still seeing this person yeah he was so dumb so dumb okay okay incredible
02:00:05 let's talk let's talk about this yeah please well I I do understand I understand the eight out of 10
02:00:11 thing I don't agree with it sure but it makes a little more sense to me comment on this been king
02:00:17 of fives that was that was a time in history he's learned and grown yeah okay five out of five
02:00:29 right I like the end of the story being punctuated by like oh yeah this person like hates me she's
02:00:34 gonna go see therapy for what I've done to her like he didn't say from what he's done oh okay okay
02:00:39 fair that's definitely mixed grappling but it's funny to assume that so I will do it anyway
02:00:44 that's smart that's wise that's wise uh I mean frankly it doesn't sound like our boy has learned
02:00:51 to say the least it does seem that things are despite his best efforts improving because he's
02:00:58 not with this person anymore and it's going to be phased out so that's good I'm glad to hear that
02:01:04 proud of him oh proud of work on proud of your boy that is not more controversial than this last
02:01:11 statement come on no all right the saga the saga concludes okay yeah so thanks for that quality
02:01:19 women here is a little voicemail from uh Jerry uh late honest love him love Jerry my favorite hey guys
02:01:27 so I know that whole Nate's girl is retarded thing is really funny yeah but I think that guy who
02:01:31 left the voicemail was onto something he was trying to expose a secret darker side of the man who
02:01:36 refers to himself as the best guy ever and I have some damning evidence spoken from his own mouth oh no
02:01:42 this is a clip from pcp episode 47 at one hour 51 minutes and 41 seconds he's got receipts take a listen
02:01:49 so why don't they why doesn't society allow me to play with retarded people yes I want to have
02:01:54 sexual retarded people I think that this is enough the show is clearly one of Nate's many
02:02:04 it's been nice knowing you he got you oh all right dude my last exactly to finish out this podcast
02:02:10 before I go to it the police are outside you are right now they ban you your last wish it's okay
02:02:16 though I believe I they've got your last meal it's a bottle of fuel I like to imagine like you know
02:02:24 there's always like the dignified deaths in tv shows where it's like an assassin's come and it's
02:02:29 just like grant me one last wish and the assassin's like of course and yours is just like let me finish
02:02:34 this episode of the pcp let me record one more podcast there's a gun pressed against my head
02:02:40 right now they're just waiting for the end to pull the trigger so well you know I thank you
02:02:44 officer you're doing a great job it's Michelle holding the gun against you she's trying to get
02:02:49 it might be Michelle dressed up um yeah well okay all right that's that's very damning uh I admit
02:02:55 to everything you've heard is true everything everything even the lines those are true too
02:03:10 all right here's uh the biggest virgin ever uh how exciting here you go it's your parallel
02:03:15 hey pcp in one episode it was said that oneitis is the deadliest disease known to man
02:03:20 I was wondering if I could get some advice on how to deal with my oneitis I'm going to call this
02:03:25 girl Karen I asked Karen out in high school she said she just wanted to be friends and I accepted
02:03:29 this and moved on I started a thing with another girl and that fell through really hard Karen helped
02:03:34 me recover because she is my friend and we started hanging out a lot but I ended up becoming obsessed
02:03:39 with Karen I think that this has caused me to no no longer see other girls as attractive or
02:03:43 interesting I recognize I had a problem in college and tried separating entirely from Karen twice
02:03:48 the both times even if you're not communicating for months the first time and years the second time
02:03:53 she tried to get back into my life and I allowed it because I figured I could handle it but I still
02:03:57 can't help but think about her every single day unfortunately trying to separate again is not an
02:04:02 option for me anymore because she joined a discord server that is pretty much all of my friends in
02:04:06 it oh he's he's locked in now boys he can't escape she's in the discord server anyway I communicate
02:04:11 with my friends if I were to try and fuck out of here dude that would mean leaving the server and
02:04:15 losing contact with that entire group of people which I am not willing to message them I feel that I
02:04:19 really need to get over this make another discord actually been dating this one guy since we graduated
02:04:24 high school so about five years I've never met him but I heard he was in his late 30s so his biological
02:04:29 clock is going to tell him to get married soon and I just don't think I can handle hearing that she
02:04:34 is getting married so that's my confusion okay I'm a 23 year old virgin with oneitis and I need
02:04:38 some advice on how to do I have thank you girl I know exactly well from what you know you know what
02:04:44 you know you know what I was kind of on board with it I was like yes oh well you can't help how you
02:04:51 feel I guess until you got to the part about how like she came back into his life and then I was
02:04:58 like this this girl is a fuck this is that's like some that's a little manipulative I think that's a
02:05:03 little bit well wait well hang on I mean I mean tell me if you think I'm wrong but my take is that
02:05:09 maybe that's true but he also might just be framing it that way like sure did she really
02:05:14 armrest her her way into his life despite I guess I guess we don't know yeah I mean it's it's the
02:05:21 fault I don't know if it's a fault of hers because if she if this if he's being her friend and she
02:05:28 misses her friend then I guess that's like not a bad thing on her part I think maybe she should be
02:05:32 more sensitive the fact that she knows there's more feelings there on his end but it's not this
02:05:36 really I just realized something I think I've just realized that we can only take this from his
02:05:44 perspective and if we actually want to understand like the best way forward for either of these people
02:05:52 we would need to get her perspective as well but since we don't have that anything we speculate
02:05:56 maybe completely off the mark and that's why we're not you know this isn't marriage that's why we
02:06:01 can't actually tell you how to do it it's just fun fun hypotheticals to to chew on so like if someone
02:06:08 does find themselves in the situation in which we happen to talk about they know the correct answer
02:06:13 because we're always right I suppose that's right that's right for this particular person like what
02:06:18 we say may not be the right thing okay okay that is true here's the thing I don't know okay maybe
02:06:24 this is cruel but I don't know if I can even have pity anymore if you've been jonesen for this girl
02:06:32 who's been with another guy for five years five years yeah are you fucking kidding me
02:06:40 look look okay I don't want to be like overly mean to this guy or anything but but okay frankly I'm
02:06:46 sensing a bunch of issues one I'm sensing generally low self-esteem and that's fine it's not like a
02:06:50 problem but like obviously if you could have got honestly guys maybe I'm crazy but like I really think
02:06:57 99.9% of guys issue with women is that there's one girl and they like that and they can't see
02:07:05 themselves being successful with any other woman like do you think Genghis Khan ever had
02:07:10 fucking one night is for anyone woman would he had you know like thousands available to him at any
02:07:14 time the answer is no the answer is if a man has a if a man has two women that would make themselves
02:07:19 available and one says I'm you know I'm not gonna do it he will say buh-bye and immediately plow into
02:07:25 the other one like light speed he'll be in there it's an impregnation um and so where is the light
02:07:33 where's the light I mean I want to be nice to this guy because I like to give helpful advice
02:07:39 dude I think your problem I mean that you yeah yeah you want to say something if you just cut in
02:07:44 I don't know how many how how many different ways can you say it's fucking get over it
02:07:48 like it's obviously not doing anything it's not even get over it you have to you have to cut
02:07:52 this person out of your life and keep it that yeah I want to put it in terms of actually
02:07:55 guys it's pretty it's pretty simple he's he's he's a coward because he hasn't tried sucking dick before
02:08:00 so consider consider it wrong you ain't wrong you know it's not gay yeah you know what you know
02:08:07 what just go to the guy that she's with and suck his dick and then make him gay and then oh my god
02:08:13 oh then she'll be available and then you can go any think about it yeah but then he'll be gay too
02:08:19 so he won't want her anymore no you can buy buy you can you can you can do that no that's a myth
02:08:29 you okay I mean yeah like Ben was saying obviously the the solution here is you got look
02:08:35 five years dude like what has it been like a relationship we're like oh my god they've been
02:08:39 on and off again these two like oh maybe there's a chance for me everything there's not a step in
02:08:44 this equation is you limiting yourself and being un like un healthily fixated on one woman every man
02:08:52 in the world is better off if you just accept the reality that like there are more than one
02:08:57 okay so this guy was saying like it's affected his ability to even be into other women okay here's
02:09:03 here's your here's your prescription this is dr. Nate's prescription I demand that you go and in some
02:09:10 capacity some social capacity whatever you just do an exercise doesn't involve it's just in your own
02:09:15 head think about the women around you and like are there any redeeming quality about what any of the
02:09:22 women around you chopped up in pieces in your refrigerator like yeah I'm just just a thought
02:09:27 experiment just a thought it's possible that anything decent could theoretically come from
02:09:33 like a dating or just fucking or whatever like relationship with any other woman and I the
02:09:38 answer you'll inevitably arrive at is yes you know what there are actually other girls that are nice
02:09:42 and might you know bring something nice to my life I'm sure I'm sure on some level he understands
02:09:47 that right and like of course yeah so like there seems to be some sort of mental block that's going
02:09:52 out so I think that what he needs to do is literally just pound a pavement go in there and
02:09:56 actually meet the women and see it firsthand this man needs a hardcore dose of of pickup
02:10:01 artistry he needs to go out literally talk to this is the cure for most men's low self-esteem
02:10:10 go out and talk to 100 girls just go do it have a checklist check off 100 and by the time you're
02:10:16 done you will no longer give a shit because the thing is 99% of men give up before they reach
02:10:23 that number if you do it you will you won't care anymore and you'll be over it now you'll probably
02:10:28 meet a girl who's nice no I agree the guy just the guy just you know you you're a guy you get like
02:10:33 this you get in the you just lack perspective you just gotta shake himself out of it that's the
02:10:37 problem the thing is he was asking about like what do I do about my discord friends oh I forgot
02:10:43 about that like join me make another one right I don't think you know I don't think you have to
02:10:49 do anything like the problem is not the discord the problem is that you lack the perspective
02:10:54 the fact that you see this girl in the discord server still like it fucks you up to the extent
02:11:00 that you have to fucking ask us for what to do about it well that that's true that that's true but
02:11:05 on all right well maybe maybe then you leave the discord and in that time use that lack of
02:11:11 distraction to try and sort yourself out and then you can go back and then you won't care I mean
02:11:16 because this like that's like this is where you totally lose me dude you're like crying about how
02:11:20 you need this discord server it's like the only revenue yeah like I get it I guess that your friends
02:11:26 are there I get that you like these people and this man has a lack of creative lack of creative
02:11:32 thinking because there are other ways you can be in contact like no no no no other social media
02:11:36 other social media I think it download Skype or whatever I don't think you're an idiot if we
02:11:42 did that none of us would talk if we still if I got downloaded Skype right now I would never talk
02:11:46 to any of you again okay what okay Skype Skype wasn't a joke but like I don't know like Twitter
02:11:51 your friends are on there no I don't know make another discord like what's it just make another
02:11:56 okay that's the real answer make another yeah yeah make another discord okay well I don't think it's
02:12:01 that crazy to say that like oh well this is where all my people are at like like that's a thing like
02:12:08 yeah you if you might okay I mean like limit your interaction with them if you I mean that
02:12:12 take up another venue the only problem to that problem no but the thing is I understand the
02:12:18 solution I think the solution is that you gotta fucking get over your shit so that the presence
02:12:24 of this person isn't like ruining your life long term that's absolutely correct but like I at the
02:12:30 very least I want to get look I'm sorry I'm not really trying to be mean to this guy I don't even
02:12:33 really find it funny or really want to but it's like to give him a tangible I want to give him
02:12:38 small steps because ultimately like yes you shouldn't care like long term yes that's the
02:12:43 place to be but in the meantime I understand that this does bug you and obviously he says like
02:12:47 ah if they get married I'll be really really upset like okay that's fine I believe you what if they
02:12:51 get married it'll be the same I mean he should he should already be as upset as he needs to get
02:12:59 you know what I mean they've been together five years exactly exactly there's no like that would
02:13:05 just be the status quo continues okay you just okay look can we all agree look five I have a
02:13:12 little discord server with like four people in it and they're my best buddies from college
02:13:16 like is it really that crazy an idea to just make a server like even if you like I understand
02:13:22 if you're trying to make a parallel server it'll be weird because like oh now they have to like
02:13:25 pick a side like which server are they gonna be like in mainly don't don't even make it that
02:13:28 complicated just bring in like the people who you really got to talk to like what is there like
02:13:33 50 of those people no you probably got like five maybe like 10 maybe less I don't know make a server
02:13:38 just with those people and talk to them through that and leave the server with everybody or if
02:13:43 you don't want to leave it whatever like mute it check it rarely like avoid the girl you should
02:13:48 probably leave it though you can come back later if you know I understand the only thing I could
02:13:52 have I wish that he had the mental capacity to just get over and not have to like completely
02:13:57 remove this person from his life because they were friends originally well of course so that's
02:14:03 this is the nature of the beast some relationship dude just do something but respect her agency
02:14:08 it's been five years dude well yeah but she's been such a tease she came back into her life you see
02:14:15 she came back into his life how could she yeah like again not trying to show any dude but like
02:14:21 come on but listen to that you sound a little bit a little silly because you're yeah you're
02:14:26 fucking okay anyway quick fucking up speaking of fucking up our next voicemail is from a hero
02:14:31 named simply insertion let's see what he's got right here should I hope go anime is a Japanese
02:14:39 colloquialism about smoking dang wait I got him by my calculations I should be sent to the boys
02:14:48 jail but with his fucking mongoloids don't understand this how much shit I have shoved up
02:14:53 my ass I got fucking cigarettes razor blades his plastic spoons dildos works I got so much
02:15:00 shit in there I can't fucking see straight man everyone in the voice jail I'm coming for you
02:15:08 you know you know I would go right into his trap mind you I would send him to the voice
02:15:12 jail but he did say a funny munchie meme from the donation lecture where I said I'm gonna
02:15:17 I'm gonna shove my dick so far up your ass you won't be able to even see anymore so I you know
02:15:21 what voice voice grail for me no voice grail if it's not much if voicemail is shit it doesn't
02:15:29 matter if it's like deliberately shit it's still shit into the jail agree I say yeah he'll make a
02:15:35 mince but you know it's no skin off our back he's got he's got all the illicit materials he'll be
02:15:39 selling to a little let me see who's in the jail the Japanese man Utah and oopsie bobo see the
02:15:46 thing is he thinks he's going to a jail where he can you know use his tools in his ass to break
02:15:52 out but what he doesn't know is that the door you open the door and then you fall straight into a pit
02:15:57 of like fiery snakes and they will eat you and you will be dead instantly and you can't wait a minute
02:16:02 is the pcb jail canonically in the same location as bail jpe perhaps there's fiery snakes around
02:16:07 oh you know it's true you know it dog damn that's some rich ass lore
02:16:15 I mean that is a jail that it like that is yeah it's a jail I you know what I let's make a canon
02:16:21 canon he did it you did the canon that's that's what it takes you slap the table it's can
02:16:27 we'll have to figure out where the voicemail grail is get a pump plush everybody and have a part of
02:16:32 pcp history yeah indeed if you fucking dare if you go in the voice gel you have to buy like 10 plushes
02:16:41 indeed okay well or maybe that's the cost to buy your weight by your freedom is to buy like 10
02:16:46 plushes we should make like a pcp city it's like washington dc where it has like monuments to all
02:16:51 of us and there will be endless war which would be the actual mon Washington monument yeah Nate
02:16:55 you're gonna have Washington DCP you're gonna you're gonna have like a like a like a Lincoln
02:16:59 monument or something Nate you know guys let's watch something out did you did you and I were
02:17:03 getting really hyped up on city planning a while back like like like eight eight months ago let's
02:17:08 bring it permission let's make it let's make pcp city and then we can have all these occasions have
02:17:12 like warp like trans like trans portalizers so you can go to like the gib and take area you
02:17:17 know if you insert a secret code into the text channel is this like in real life in real life
02:17:22 the secret codes yeah okay okay that sounds good we'll buy a floating island of the coast of
02:17:29 Bangladesh or whatever well there's like free farmland in Oklahoma so we should just go there
02:17:34 and then like set up like like like like a disney world-esque functioning city
02:17:39 that sounds okay all right all right green light up yeah think think about it green light it
02:17:44 uh let's we'll launch the Kickstarter short link link below uh okay next voicemail is from
02:17:48 Annie Fred uh okay go no this guy no did you I wanted to ask you your opinions on Nate's recent
02:17:55 comments about you um frankly I was disgusted oh yeah um and it's pretty shocking I mean
02:18:08 how are you guys gonna sew up your relationship I mean surely it's over at this point I mean
02:18:13 Nate I mean I got receipts from the outside line um you owe digi an apology frankly
02:18:21 I owe that man nothing he owes me everything okay okay okay let me get a low den I mean
02:18:26 in your words did you all right oh god he's still going oh what oh god okay that's the last part
02:18:33 yeah I did too I don't I don't know I don't know what he said okay okay okay Annie Fred is the
02:18:38 antithesis as I think he said fuck digi I believe is what he said he's the antithesis of me of me
02:18:43 aka the average pcp fan so Annie Fred like is emblematic like if you were to take every pcp fan
02:18:50 and put them into like a big like like melting vat and just stirred them all together you would get
02:18:56 Annie Fred he is the literal embodiment of what it means to be a pcp fan he comes in to the rck
02:19:02 discord meetup he comes in with his anime avatar I make fun of his avatar and and and then and then
02:19:09 he changes it facetiously to a shit avatar to make fun of me when really he should be the one
02:19:14 that's made fun of for his shit anime avatar listen I'm not gonna forgive you just goes you oh right
02:19:20 the wrong facetiously I'll kill you I'll kill you Annie Fred you're dead statistically well what was
02:19:29 this yeah what was the drama that's being discussed is in the um uh the mea math of a two
02:19:35 film festival uh one person uh in their video did they made some like a criticism of digi uh
02:19:43 and in my in my feedback in the notes I just put a haha yeah hashtag fuck digi and I stand by it to

02:21:40 keep
02:21:54 I see how it is I could I could see that voicemail I could see the waveform in my eyes
02:22:02 I'm sorry I'm laughing I'm sorry I'm sorry people love my goofy jokes
02:22:10 we shouldn't we shouldn't encourage this they respect me they appreciate my eclectic taste
02:22:15 in voicemail comedy god damn it and I'm standing by what the people want I'm with the wacky
02:22:20 wavy inflatable arm flailing two man you know what wacky wavy inflatable two man you know what I
02:22:26 I should be cursing you, but you know what I had to preach you know a master's
02:22:32 represent masters and you know what I that's right God look my my my my
02:22:38 experience with that was completely binary I was like this is garbage
02:22:42 that was the best voicemail today God you know all right there's some there was
02:22:49 something about like the extent to which that effect was applied like it was a
02:22:54 little way too much which made it sort of kind of good exactly exactly I mean I
02:23:01 don't know if we heard some more of the saga of the wacky it was it was it was
02:23:05 PCB bonus episode ASMR core that was what I liked about is just that like it was so
02:23:12 like the visualization of it is just this man like it's so extreme that I
02:23:18 could not possibly imagine like what this man were to look like and how he would
02:23:22 be recording to a microphone like it like you'd be moving away so fast it
02:23:27 would be like a single frame he's on screen than a single frame he's not just
02:23:30 over and over again oh what a hero thank you so much if you there's more into
02:23:37 this song that honor there's always space on the grail for a man such as well
02:23:41 okay all right well let's not go that far let's not go that far this guy this guy
02:23:46 is going to jail okay he's going straight to jail
02:23:49 we've got one time not just like South America or something yeah basically the
02:23:55 same thing but we got one final message and this is from of course our old buddy
02:24:00 the I'll die corporation voicemail bot today on true
02:24:04 oppression no more no more soccer for us this dumb these now this is good this
02:24:11 let's hear what he has to say about oppression okay go booting up I'll die
02:24:16 corporation voicemail bot okay I'm ready through an objective analysis of all
02:24:22 social issues spanning the entirety of the globe I have rightfully calculated
02:24:26 that the most depressed minority in the world is foot fetishists the most common
02:24:29 through line in all discourse is the insistence on such a fetish being the
02:24:32 lowest of flow could it be because of the sweaty odor calculation saying while
02:24:36 the foot can often be sweaty few areas of the body perspired more than the
02:24:39 genitals which are nearly universally acclaimed as areas of high sexual value
02:24:43 how about it's association with unclean substances such as dirt again this is
02:24:48 found wanting genitals are most strongly associated with producing human waste
02:24:51 product oh my god that is far from being described as clean perhaps it could be a
02:24:55 fear of transmitting disease alas it cannot be so virtually all forms of
02:24:59 physical sex are prone to promoting the transmission of disease yet this does
02:25:03 not deter humans from performing such actions in conclusion my calculations
02:25:07 have assessed that the reason foot fetishists are so looked down upon must
02:25:10 be a jealous explain to anybody involved with its creation especially the
02:25:22 moderator of the aisle die corporation voicemail bot alright this no the facts
02:25:29 are in game I know the fact is you're a degenerate foot they framed it shit this
02:25:33 voicemail bot framed it in the wrong way people don't look down on foot
02:25:37 fetishes because you it's stinky they look down on it because they don't get
02:25:43 it I mean they like because they literally look down on it I don't think
02:25:48 foot fetishes are like that maligned because people like as a joke will just
02:25:53 put their feet like yeah sure look at it like because they don't feel anything
02:25:57 they don't feel like they're being slutty by showing but on the other end
02:26:01 people will be like oh feet like it's it's just sort of like like I don't I
02:26:07 don't I don't buy the the foot fetishists are maligned I don't see that all the
02:26:13 time yeah there's there's definitely a good people don't get beat up for
02:26:21 liking foot feet so oppressed they can't even be public about their love of
02:26:27 feet it's it's a damn okay but like horrible that's like the case for a lot
02:26:32 of kinks like most of them yeah I feel like feet feet are like like that's the
02:26:42 more on the vanilla scale more on the vanilla side of like fetishes that you
02:26:47 can't say that you have well okay did you see that famous king of the hill
02:26:51 episode where Peggy with her famously massive feet was contracted to be a quote
02:26:56 unquote model and then they had her doing some very odd foot positioning and
02:27:01 it turns out it was for a foot fetish website and when she found this out she
02:27:05 was deeply disturbed and you know that people would be a quacking it to her
02:27:09 old big old knockers of the foot variety and I get it I get it would you get it
02:27:16 what point did you even make with that I agree that I did it fetish people
02:27:26 to be put on a pedestal the exact reverse of everything that's happening now
02:27:29 they should be completely like a pedestal like on a on a gallows before you pull
02:27:34 the switch and they all you know fall through but I just agree with the
02:27:36 statement that they are the most for I think my friend George Washington tune
02:27:41 fetishist we'll have a problem with that as he is of the variety that tune
02:27:45 fetishists are the most marginalized group in society so what's a tune fetishist
02:27:51 somebody likes the Simpsons no yeah well exactly someone like like who likes
02:27:55 over stylized like overly cartoony like no anatomy no representation of the
02:28:01 human anatomy whatsoever like like you know like just pure like bending for
02:28:05 example just pure undultrated lines on a page that don't represent humans but
02:28:09 think they have like so they're adults can't help but like them yeah that's it
02:28:15 that's all I think you I think you George Washington tune fetishist will be
02:28:19 good friends yeah that's my that's my new friend I talked about I checked out
02:28:25 on a really long time ago people will know good man all right well that's it
02:28:29 that's our last question was steeped in comedy I was trying to be serious and I
02:28:33 couldn't I couldn't tell if anyone else was serious I was being serious I was
02:28:36 being serious on the fact that's like why why why foot fetish like that's not
02:28:42 the worst fetish okay okay being completely serious but it's not that
02:28:50 it's the worst fetish it's that the people who have it are the most they're
02:28:54 numerous they're numerous and like you never see him coming and like they're
02:28:58 sneaky and they're weird no okay I don't I don't get I speak seriously there's a
02:29:04 lot of people who like make fun of foot fetish like that's a go-to make fun of
02:29:08 for a lot of right guys how can you think it's not a joke it's not a joke it's
02:29:15 not it's not it's not obviously the they're not the most oppressed minority
02:29:21 god damn it but that's what the voicemail if you fucking shut the fuck up
02:29:30 and die I mean you're changing the topic to be the most oppressed fetish okay
02:29:37 fine no why are you fucking listen why don't you we're we're having a
02:29:41 conversation keep up think about it I'll put shoes on my feet and I will keep
02:29:50 up I'll keep all the fetishes away I don't want them looking at all the same
02:29:55 way I feel about like people saying that ginger people are like really oppressed
02:30:00 XD nobody have no souls it's just like I don't know it's not even that funny
02:30:06 that's why it's a noisy so much because it's not even that funny to say all
02:30:10 these things that aren't even that particularly true making fun of people
02:30:15 who have diaper fetishes now that's funny because that's clearly very strange
02:30:20 and haha clearly I guess so I mean I have no substantive argument to make
02:30:26 against foot fetishists I suppose other than yeah I mean the bot pretty much
02:30:32 I've got no ammo in the chamber fetishes are all by their nature just really weird so
02:30:36 like you know keep it in the bedroom you're not hurting anybody cool cool
02:30:39 beans indeed my knee trick reaction will be to make fun of them but like the
02:30:43 knee trick reaction isn't always the best reaction so it's like you're not
02:30:49 allowed to show your feet on twitch under any circumstances because yeah
02:30:54 because okay I mean I've heard this from multiple sources I could have been lied
02:31:00 to by multiple I heard you're not allowed to show your feet on twitch
02:31:05 because it is porn to do that I mean that that you know a slightly different
02:31:08 example but like just like now these days you are not allowed YouTube changes
02:31:12 policy you're not allowed to comment on perfectly innocuous videos of minors a
02:31:17 lot of the time because some people like perceive them you know like sexually or
02:31:22 whatever and yeah that's pretty weird that's a odd stance to take I mean I
02:31:26 get it I think we're kind of throwing out the baby with the bathwater
02:31:30 saying oh yeah I love videos of babies being thrown out with
02:31:36 that's my go-to epic that epic baby and bathwater prank 2019
