00:00:00 Come on, you fuckers think that just cause a guy reads comics, he can't start some shit?
00:00:04 Aw, fuck it, take all you want!
00:00:06 We're violent, we're heavy.
00:00:08 Home again, home again.
00:00:10 Gibbontake a lot!
00:00:11 Class is paying 101.
00:00:15 I guess one person can make a difference.
00:00:24 Welcome to the panel cast.
00:00:26 I am the Wolfman, baby.
00:00:30 Woooo!
00:00:35 Does anybody get what I'm doing?
00:00:37 That's Wolfman Jack.
00:00:39 He was a radio DJ a million years ago.
00:00:43 That's what I am now, cause it's Halloween.
00:00:46 I'm a Wolfman, I'm just like Wolfman Jack.
00:00:49 Only I'm not quite as powerful as Wolfman Jack.
00:00:52 I'm a Wolfboy, I'm a Wolfman in training.
00:00:55 Though I do share his lupinous condition.
00:00:59 It's a lupinous condition, not a lupus condition.
00:01:03 It's not lupus, it's never lupus.
00:01:06 It is in fact lupinous in origin.
00:01:11 The curse of the lichen flows through my blood.
00:01:15 Every Wednesday when the comics are released,
00:01:18 I transform into a comic devouring Wolfboy.
00:01:23 Ready to run out into the streets
00:01:27 and read comics and scare people.
00:01:33 I'm not quite as good at howling as the original Wolfman.
00:01:37 Though I do suffer from Lycanecticus.
00:01:41 I also suffer from a rare and debilitating form of Schifilophagus
00:01:47 that makes me unable to howl with the same level of strength
00:01:52 and force and power and gusto as the Wolfman
00:01:56 so I can only manage to croak out a barely audible...
00:02:13 What am I talking about?
00:02:15 Welcome to Panelcast, true believers.
00:02:18 I am your host, Endlit G.
00:02:22 I'm just stealing that true believers catchphrase from Stan Lee completely.
00:02:26 I'm 100% ripping that off.
00:02:28 I can do that.
00:02:29 That's within my rights as the most important person who ever lived.
00:02:33 I have sold a minion over the legal right to rip off, steal, and appropriate
00:02:40 any catchphrases or turns of phrase spoken or uttered by anyone who has ever lived.
00:02:47 Ah, like an absorbal off, absorbing the most powerful traits of all great men.
00:02:53 Because I am them.
00:02:55 I am everyone and everything.
00:02:58 That's why I am the endless boy.
00:03:01 Bitch.
00:03:02 I don't think Stan Lee will mind.
00:03:05 If I drop an Excelsior every now and then or if I open my podcast
00:03:13 with a true believer, if I so choose, he doesn't mind.
00:03:16 Me and him are tight.
00:03:17 We go way back.
00:03:18 In fact, me and him had a running contest in the 80s to see who would get the most girls.
00:03:22 Last I checked, I was way ahead.
00:03:25 Besides, that dude's like 500 years old.
00:03:27 He'll probably turn to dust or go back to his home planet at some point pretty soon.
00:03:33 And then, where will his essence go, if not to me?
00:03:38 I'm like Shang Tsung.
00:03:39 As long as someone is dead,
00:03:42 I have the power to harness and appropriate their essence, their visage,
00:03:47 their form to disorient my opponents in combat.
00:03:52 In the combat of the mortals.
00:03:56 What the fuck is happening?
00:04:00 This is already week two of the panel cast,
00:04:03 and it's already just a complete train wreck spiraling down the drain.
00:04:09 Eat your debris.
00:04:11 It's already turning into a...
00:04:13 Oh boy.
00:04:17 Ah.
00:04:18 God damn it, I'm the motherfucking wolf man.
00:04:21 Okay, let's talk about comics, people.
00:04:25 That's what this podcast is about.
00:04:27 That's what life is about.
00:04:28 It's the only thing that truly matters.
00:04:30 The only thing that brings me any real sense of peace and tranquility
00:04:33 in this rotten, miserable hellhole of a planet.
00:04:36 It's the only thing I trust anymore,
00:04:38 because comics are the only safe activity left
00:04:42 for a psychotic man like myself, okay?
00:04:45 I've been eagerly anticipating sitting down here
00:04:48 and recording another panel cast for everybody this week,
00:04:51 because comics, reading comics is the only time I feel safe anymore.
00:04:55 It's the only safe activity left.
00:04:58 Going outside is not safe.
00:05:00 It's not safe out there for a man like me.
00:05:03 Chaos follows me.
00:05:05 Conflict follows me.
00:05:07 Everywhere I go, I just want to live in peace,
00:05:09 but nobody wants to let me.
00:05:11 Everybody wants to fuck with me.
00:05:13 Everybody wants to take shots at the champ.
00:05:16 So everywhere I go, I end up in some fight,
00:05:19 or some huge brawl,
00:05:21 or someone fucks with me,
00:05:23 or I become the center of some swirling tornado
00:05:27 of chaos and violence.
00:05:29 Happens to me every single time I go out.
00:05:31 Just the other day, in fact, I went to a party,
00:05:33 and of course I ended up at the center of a huge fucking brawl,
00:05:36 because everyone has to fuck with me.
00:05:38 Everybody has to start shit,
00:05:40 and nobody expects that the guy they're fucking with
00:05:43 is gonna fuck with them right back.
00:05:45 Nobody expects that somebody in this world
00:05:47 still has the balls to stand up for themselves.
00:05:49 So of course I end up in the middle of a huge fucking catastrophic brawl.
00:05:53 I'm fighting people off me from all sides.
00:05:56 I'm throwing bitches left and right.
00:05:58 I got guys hanging off me.
00:06:00 I'm punching, I'm kicking, I'm scratching, I'm killing.
00:06:03 Oh god, it was chaos.
00:06:05 I was just like Brody in my intro.
00:06:07 Come on, you fuckers think that just because the guy reads comics,
00:06:10 he can't start some shit?
00:06:11 I'll fucking take all you on!
00:06:13 You know, it's the same old song and dance with me.
00:06:16 Everywhere I go, this happens.
00:06:18 I'm used to it,
00:06:19 but I'm also getting pretty sick and tired of it,
00:06:21 and it's all because some people just can't take a joke.
00:06:26 Some people just can't comprehend
00:06:29 or wrap their minds around the intricate concept of humor.
00:06:34 It's like rocket surgery to some people.
00:06:36 You know, it seems like you can't even show up in a Trump hat
00:06:39 and start slapping bitches anymore
00:06:41 without everybody losing their sense of humor all of a sudden.
00:06:44 Well, I apologize if my satire was too high-brow
00:06:49 for you Neanderthals to understand,
00:06:51 but I thought this was America.
00:06:53 Anyways, I'm sure I'll get into the gory,
00:06:55 hilarious, awesome details of that story
00:06:58 at some other point on some other podcast,
00:07:00 but this is not the place for it.
00:07:01 This is the place for comics people.
00:07:04 I'm talking about all the wonderful, wacky, wild,
00:07:07 and exciting comics that I read this week.
00:07:10 And also, I am the Wolfman.
00:07:12 Don't forget that.
00:07:13 I'm gonna quiz you on all of this after the podcast is done.
00:07:17 Who is the Wolfman?
00:07:19 What are comics for?
00:07:21 Who likes them?
00:07:22 What country is this and where's my America?
00:07:25 All important questions that you will be graded on.
00:07:29 Harshly.
00:07:31 One other piece of news that I forgot to mention
00:07:34 in the pilot episode of this podcast,
00:07:37 and last week's episode, I didn't mention this.
00:07:39 Wasn't sure if I wanted to mention it,
00:07:41 but as I go through and talk about all of these comics,
00:07:44 if any of them peak your curiosity
00:07:47 and you want to check them out and you want to read them,
00:07:50 there are comic reader websites where people just post them
00:07:54 and you can read them for free all over the internet.
00:07:56 I guess I'll put one in the description box.
00:07:59 Obviously, it's not legal, but you know, who gives a fuck?
00:08:03 I use it and I still buy comics.
00:08:06 You know, usually what happens is if I read a comic on there
00:08:09 that I like, then I go out and buy it.
00:08:12 So I think that sites like these actually drive sales.
00:08:14 I think that piracy often has just as much of a beneficial effect
00:08:19 to sales as any negative effect that anyone says it has.
00:08:23 So if I talk about comics and they sound cool to you by all means,
00:08:26 check them out and then go fucking buy them
00:08:28 if you feel like it or if you don't feel like I don't fucking give a shit, man.
00:08:33 I don't give a shit. I'm an easygoing guy.
00:08:36 Until someone fucks with me and then I become the motherfucking wolf man, baby.
00:08:48 I'm just gonna make sounds.
00:08:50 Noises.
00:08:51 I read Wonder Woman this week.
00:08:53 Yeah, how's that for a smooth segue?
00:08:55 So this Wonder Woman series is part of DC's whole company-wide
00:09:00 rebirth branding thing.
00:09:03 And what the rebirth thing is, is a couple years ago,
00:09:06 DC did this big retcon.
00:09:09 They called it the New 52.
00:09:11 They were sort of, they were trying to simplify their continuity
00:09:15 by saying that like, okay, the whole DC universe now started five years ago
00:09:20 and that's the new status quo.
00:09:22 But in trying to simplify their continuity for new readers and such,
00:09:26 all they actually managed to accomplish was
00:09:29 they made it a million times more confusing and complicated
00:09:33 and accidentally totally screwed the pooch and ruined everything
00:09:36 because when you take, you know, 80 years of continuity
00:09:39 and try to squish it all into five years,
00:09:41 suddenly nothing makes any fucking sense.
00:09:44 Like everywhere you would look, there was all this weird shit that you couldn't,
00:09:48 like saying that like Batman, for example, has only been around for five years,
00:09:52 that does not work in any way with all the different Batman stories.
00:09:57 You know, the fact alone that there's been like six different Robins, you know,
00:10:01 like Dick Grayson has gone from a 12-year-old boy to like a 25-year-old man
00:10:08 and then you had Jason Todd and Tim Drake also growing up into grown ass men
00:10:13 and then he has this son, Damien, who's like 12 years old,
00:10:18 whom he's sired with Talia Al Ghul when he was still Batman 12 years ago.
00:10:25 The very idea of squishing all this continuity into like a five-year span
00:10:30 inherently ruins everything and makes nothing sensical or coherent in any way.
00:10:36 And there were so many weird plot holes that arose from this decision,
00:10:40 from this rebranding, you know, like the Teen Titans were totally fucked,
00:10:45 the Teen Titans are still fucked, nothing, nothing can save the Teen Titans now
00:10:52 because of the continuity and how badly it's been fucked.
00:10:55 The Teen Titans make no fucking sense and I don't think they ever will again.
00:11:00 Nightwing is in his 20s, but Starfire and Raven are still somehow on the Teen Titans
00:11:06 and still I'm supposed to believe they're still teenagers,
00:11:08 even though Damien's now also in the Teen Titans and he's like 12
00:11:12 and Cyborg now was never a Teen Titan, he was just a Justice League guy
00:11:16 like what's going on, I don't understand any of this shit anymore,
00:11:19 none of it makes any sense anymore.
00:11:21 So they just totally ruined everything and it made it really hard to get invested
00:11:26 in DC's stories for a long time, but the great thing about DC is that at a certain point
00:11:31 they finally looked at all the fan response and they said, you know what,
00:11:34 yeah we did kind of fucking ruin everything for a couple years though,
00:11:37 let's go back and try to fix it, let's try to smooth things out a bit.
00:11:42 So they went back and basically this rebirth branding thing that they're doing now
00:11:48 is kind of like DC's apology to fans, it's their way of saying,
00:11:52 alright we admit it, we fucked up and they're kind of like slowly reintegrating
00:11:58 all of the old continuity that was lost in the New 52 relaunch.
00:12:04 So they're, you know, trying to get everything back to basics and get back to the way it was
00:12:10 and getting rid of all the weird, hokey, New 52 bullshit that nobody liked,
00:12:15 like for example Wonder Woman and Superman being like romantically involved,
00:12:21 which is like a weird like leftover idea from Frank Miller in the 80s
00:12:26 that he had a boner for but doesn't really make sense to anyone else,
00:12:30 but they did it anyways, like what the, like it kind of ruins both characters
00:12:35 to say that, you know, they're this like Brangelina power couple
00:12:40 lording over the world in their fucking watch tower.
00:12:43 I mean like the main thing that makes Superman or Wonder Woman relatable and special
00:12:49 is that they both date regular people, like Superman's girlfriend is Lois Lane,
00:12:54 she's just a regular chick because Superman is a regular guy.
00:12:58 If you take Superman and you have him fucking Wonder Woman,
00:13:01 suddenly neither of them are like regular people anymore,
00:13:04 they're just larger than life gods who are sitting up on Olympus licking each other's assholes
00:13:10 and lording it over the rest of humanity.
00:13:13 It's dumb.
00:13:15 So anyways, this issue of Wonder Woman starts out with Steve Trevor,
00:13:19 Wonder Woman's old boyfriend.
00:13:22 Steve Trevor, if you don't know the character, he was the guy who first,
00:13:26 he was like a fighter pilot who first crash landed on the island of Themyscira
00:13:31 and discovered the Amazons and discovered Princess Diana,
00:13:35 not Princess Diana the one that you're thinking of.
00:13:39 Not the young woman who died in the car crash and her beanie baby is worth like $50 million.
00:13:45 I'm talking about Wonder Woman's name as Diana, she's...
00:13:50 So yeah, Steve Trevor is the guy who discovered Wonder Woman
00:13:55 and he's pretty much always been her boyfriend or her romantic interest
00:14:00 or her best buddy or her human compadre.
00:14:03 He's always been sort of integral to Wonder Woman.
00:14:07 So this comic starts out with Steve Trevor
00:14:09 and then a bunch of stuff happens in the middle that I don't understand
00:14:13 because I haven't been reading this series, I haven't been keeping up with it.
00:14:16 There's some stuff about like Diana can't find Themyscira anymore,
00:14:20 like it's hidden from her for some reason.
00:14:22 She's trying to find her way back to Themyscira and it's like off the map.
00:14:25 I have no idea what's going on.
00:14:27 I have not been reading this series, I just jumped into issue number nine.
00:14:30 But near the end of the book there's a scene where Steve Trevor is hanging out on the beach
00:14:38 and Wonder Woman goes and joins him and they have like a conversation on the beach
00:14:43 and they have this come to Jesus meeting, this sort of
00:14:49 we used to be boyfriend and girlfriend kind of talk.
00:14:55 They have some real talk and they're talking about Superman
00:15:00 and he's like, you know, I can't blame you for going out with Superman.
00:15:05 I mean, he's fucking Superman, man.
00:15:07 She's like, yeah, maybe it was wrong, maybe it was more convenient than it was.
00:15:12 And Wonder Woman kind of goes into the speech about her motivations for having been with Superman.
00:15:19 Kind of like retconning some purpose into that weird fucking
00:15:24 corporately mandated romance, right?
00:15:28 Trying to retcon some, I guess, character motivation into it that makes some semblance of sense.
00:15:34 And Wonder Woman is going on this speech and it's a good speech.
00:15:37 And I feel like for once Wonder Woman actually came off like a person with a personality.
00:15:44 She usually doesn't for me. She usually doesn't do it for me.
00:15:47 But I think it was pretty well written and they're having this conversation
00:15:51 and yada yada and blue bitty blue and long story short, they kiss and so they're back together.
00:15:56 So that's what I'm talking about with the rebirth line and why it's been so great and so satisfying
00:16:02 is because the entire rebirth line that DC has been doing all year has basically
00:16:07 just been them kind of getting back to basics and saying, yeah, we fucked up
00:16:12 and slowly putting all the puzzle pieces back together the way they belong together
00:16:17 and putting everything as it should be in its right place.
00:16:21 You know what it feels like to read these rebirth stories
00:16:25 and see them fixing all these mistakes and rectifying all these weird directions
00:16:31 that they went on over the last couple of years because it's been hard to read DC comics
00:16:36 for the last couple of years ever since the New 52 began.
00:16:40 Even good comics, it's been hard to read just because the continuity got so fucked
00:16:45 and there were so many weird things going on.
00:16:47 So in order to understand what it feels like to now read these rebirth comics
00:16:52 and see them one by one fixing everything and putting the puzzle pieces back where they belong
00:16:58 or at least back into a shape where they make sense again,
00:17:01 it feels so satisfying to see these things like Wonder Woman kissing Steve Trevor
00:17:07 or Green Arrow being back together with Black Canary and they're on an island or some shit
00:17:13 or Superman and Lois Lane having a house and a kid together
00:17:18 and his kids got superpowers and he's teaching his kid how to be superpowers guy.
00:17:23 It's so fucking satisfying. It feels like all's right with the world.
00:17:28 Like God's in his heaven, Superman is fucking Lois Lane and all's right with the world.
00:17:34 I read it and I feel warm inside. I feel like I can feel electricity in my blood
00:17:41 and I can feel endorphins shooting off into my brain and making me feel safe and secure again
00:17:47 in a way that I haven't felt since I was a child.
00:17:50 I can feel the pages of the comic growing larger and enveloping me
00:17:55 like a warm blanket of security and it's like I'm just melting into it.
00:18:00 My body is breaking down and I'm melting into the pages.
00:18:04 I'm becoming part of the comic.
00:18:06 I'm seeing my world in ink and color and separated into panels.
00:18:12 I'm being drawn into a realm of pure imagination,
00:18:16 a realm of comics just like the Sega Genesis game, Comic Zone.
00:18:21 I'm becoming one with the comics and I'm soaring through a vast and beautiful universe
00:18:27 like the Silver Surfer.
00:18:29 I'm seeing colorful nebulas and a technique color of different galaxies and star systems
00:18:36 becoming one with the hopes and dreams of all good little comic boys and comic girls out there.
00:18:43 I've obtained the Power Cosmic like the Silver Surfer,
00:18:46 only it's even more powerful than the Power Cosmic because it's the Power Comic.
00:18:50 I'm surfing through the galaxy on a board of the Power Comic.
00:18:55 A storyboard, if you will.
00:18:58 Ha ha ha ha!
00:19:00 That's me sucking my stogie because I just told I made a brilliant play on words.
00:19:08 You know what it's like? It's like the video game Res for PS2 where you're like a wireframe guy
00:19:13 and you're flying through this like crazy techno cyberspace scape and it's like a shmup.
00:19:19 It's like Res. I've become Res.
00:19:22 And I'm seeing all of these beautiful heartwarming images flashing before my eyes
00:19:28 as I soar through a beautiful brilliant galaxy of colors and shapes and memories and feelings.
00:19:36 Witnessing all of these pieces fall back into place the way they belong.
00:19:41 All of these puzzle pieces coming back together to form a cohesive picture once again in my mind.
00:19:48 And I'm hearing Tom York from Radiohead crooning like an angel.
00:19:54 Everything in its right place.
00:19:59 That song is playing.
00:20:01 Look up everything in its right place by Radiohead because that's the soundtrack of this journey into mystery
00:20:08 that my soul, my essence is undertaking through the universe.
00:20:14 Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
00:20:19 Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
00:20:23 Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
00:20:29 That's what it's like. Feels good man.
00:20:33 Anyways it was pretty good and I don't even like Wonder Woman that much so you know that's good.
00:20:40 The next comic I read was fucking um fuck.
00:20:47 Suddenly it's really fucking hot in here. Oh my god. Oh god get the sweater off me. Oh god!
00:20:56 I'm done. I'm taking a nap. Going to bed. Finish this one. Finish it later.
00:21:03 The next comic I read which is probably the most high profile comic that came out this week
00:21:09 was Civil War II number six.
00:21:13 And let me tell you this comic can go fuck itself. This is a piece of shit.
00:21:17 It's a fucking, it's a pile of fuck. I don't respect it.
00:21:21 I don't respect it. The fact that it exists.
00:21:25 And it's not even a bad comic. It's fun.
00:21:31 I get it. I get why comics like these sell because it's all the superheroes in one book.
00:21:38 And I guess to normies who have not seen that every year who are not sick of it
00:21:43 because normies do not have this event fatigue that comic book fans get.
00:21:48 That's why these event comics continue to sell.
00:21:51 Because if you don't read comics regularly then of course you want to see all of the superheroes fighting each other in a comic.
00:21:58 But when it's every single year you're reading comics and every fucking year Marvel has some new goofy gimmick event comic
00:22:08 and it's always some new ridiculous conflict of characters acting out of character
00:22:14 and you know personalities being stretched so far in order to meet this corporately mandated battle
00:22:22 where we have to have side A beat up side B and vice versa
00:22:27 to the point where the characters aren't even acting rationally like themselves anymore
00:22:32 and the stories don't make any sense and they just bleed into all of the other comics
00:22:36 and stick their dicks into every other story currently going on.
00:22:40 And nothing can make sense anymore.
00:22:42 No storyline gets a chance to breathe on its own.
00:22:45 No comic gets a chance to breathe or stretch its wings
00:22:49 and see what it can do with its own universe and its own storylines and its own characters.
00:22:54 Character development is thrown out the window all across the board.
00:22:57 It's all swept away once a year to make way for some huge goofy clusterfuck event comic
00:23:03 that's usually bloated and takes what fucking half the year to come out
00:23:08 with 50 fucking tie-in issues.
00:23:10 God damn it! I hate these fucking event comics!
00:23:13 I cursed them! I'm sick of them!
00:23:16 Oh god.
00:23:18 You know you've got DC over here with its rebirth shit
00:23:21 and like yeah you could make the argument that it's kind of taking things back to the status quo
00:23:28 but not really. It's not getting rid of character development or anything like that.
00:23:33 It's not putting things back exactly how they were.
00:23:36 It's just putting things back in a way that fucking makes sense.
00:23:39 It's putting the characters, it's making them like themselves again,
00:23:43 making them recognizable again.
00:23:44 It's not getting rid of any character development
00:23:46 but these fucking Marvel events every year.
00:23:49 Holy shit!
00:23:51 Marvel is all about the illusion of change.
00:23:54 You know every year we're gonna shake up the Marvel Universe with some crazy new gimmick.
00:23:59 The fallout from this event is gonna be so catastrophic
00:24:03 and universe changing.
00:24:05 Nothing will ever be the same again.
00:24:08 They say that every fucking year and it's always bullshit.
00:24:13 It's like they think they're shaking up the status quo
00:24:16 but there's no status quo to shake up anymore.
00:24:20 The events are the status quo
00:24:23 because every fucking year there's an entire year of like weird fallout
00:24:28 and goofy gimmicks that don't make any sense.
00:24:32 And then by the time anything starts to make sense again
00:24:35 by the time the stories start getting back on their feet
00:24:38 then by that time it's time for the next year's stupid event
00:24:42 that's going to shake things up in some other recocculus way.
00:24:45 Oh this year fucking the X-Men are outlaws
00:24:49 and mutants are endangered
00:24:51 and then the next year mutants are not endangered
00:24:53 but then the next year they are again
00:24:55 and then this year there's a registration act
00:24:57 and then the next year Norman Osborn is in charge of the government
00:25:00 so the maniacs are running the asylum
00:25:02 and then the next year there's Skrulls.
00:25:05 Some people are Skrulls in disguise
00:25:07 and it's a hole you gotta figure out who the bad guys are.
00:25:10 You can't trust anybody.
00:25:11 And then the next year Peter Parker is now a fucking billionaire
00:25:14 on the level of Tony Stark, a genius inventor for some fucking reason
00:25:18 and then the next year you've got fucking, you know...
00:25:22 Fuck! Fuck!
00:25:24 Enough! Enough already!
00:25:26 Nobody can keep up with this shit.
00:25:28 It's all goofy. It's fucking retarded.
00:25:31 Civil War II? Are you fucking kidding me?
00:25:34 Who asked for that? Who wanted it?
00:25:37 Oh because they made a Civil War movie
00:25:39 they've gotta fucking have a comic that says Civil War on the shelves
00:25:44 so Normies will buy it.
00:25:46 They had to concoct this recocular Civil War II story
00:25:49 which is even more nonsensical and retarded
00:25:52 than the first one was ten years ago.
00:25:54 Somehow it's even more ridiculous.
00:25:57 You know by the grace of God
00:25:59 the Captain America movie Civil War
00:26:02 fixed the Civil War comic story
00:26:05 which was a fucking retarded comic book story
00:26:08 that everybody hated because it didn't make any fucking sense.
00:26:12 Oh god I hate it!
00:26:14 Oh god!
00:26:16 So the story of Civil War II
00:26:19 is that there's this inhuman.
00:26:22 The inhumans are a group of fucking assholes
00:26:27 who live on the moon.
00:26:28 I don't even want to fucking get into them
00:26:30 because I fucking hate the inhumans.
00:26:32 They're the worst thing ever created
00:26:34 but they fucking unleash a poisonous gas cloud on Earth
00:26:37 and it's making more people into inhumans.
00:26:39 So more people are getting inhuman powers
00:26:42 and there's this fucking kid named Ulysses
00:26:45 and he gets these pre-cog powers
00:26:48 where he can tell the future
00:26:50 and so since he can tell the future
00:26:52 he has visions of these horrible catastrophes, right?
00:26:55 So all the superheroes get in a room
00:26:58 and they go,
00:26:59 what are we gonna do about this kid's visions
00:27:01 of the horrible catastrophes?
00:27:03 And fucking half the people
00:27:06 are led by Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers,
00:27:09 who says, oh, we should use the kid
00:27:13 to stop crimes before they happen.
00:27:15 And then half the guys are led by Tony Stark, Iron Man.
00:27:18 And he says, no, that's crazy.
00:27:20 Haven't you idiots ever seen Minority Report?
00:27:23 And Carol says, no, I haven't seen Minority Report.
00:27:27 I've never seen this trope before
00:27:30 and therefore I'm a fucking moron
00:27:33 and I think it's a good idea.
00:27:37 Sorry, I'm sorry, not Miss Marvel.
00:27:39 She's not Miss Marvel anymore.
00:27:40 She's Captain Marvel now.
00:27:41 You can't call her Miss Marvel.
00:27:42 It's regressive.
00:27:44 The little brown girl is Miss Marvel.
00:27:47 She can be called Miss because at least she's brown.
00:27:50 At least in some way she's inclusive and diverse.
00:27:53 You can't have a white girl.
00:27:54 You can't call women Miss.
00:27:57 So Miss Marvel is not Captain Marvel.
00:28:00 Oh God.
00:28:01 So Captain Marvel takes a bunch of guys.
00:28:03 She takes War Machine and She-Hulk.
00:28:06 She assembles a team and she goes to fight Thanos.
00:28:09 Thanos.
00:28:11 Thanos or Thanos?
00:28:13 I feel like Thanos sounds better.
00:28:16 She goes to fight Thanos because the fucking Ulysses kid
00:28:19 had a vision that Thanos was going to beat everyone up.
00:28:22 Really bad.
00:28:24 So she goes to Thanos.
00:28:26 She finds him in his fucking house and starts a fight.
00:28:29 And what do you know?
00:28:31 Thanos beats everyone up.
00:28:33 Really bad.
00:28:34 She just barges into his fucking place.
00:28:37 He's mining his own business.
00:28:39 And he's sitting in his best chair.
00:28:42 And she busts through the wall like the fucking Kool-Aid man
00:28:45 with War Machine and She-Hulk
00:28:48 and starts a fucking fight.
00:28:51 So yeah, the kid's vision came true.
00:28:54 But only because she fucking, you know.
00:28:57 And that's how the trope works, right?
00:29:00 That's how this trope always ends up.
00:29:03 Seeing the future is what locks the future
00:29:06 because they see it and by trying to avoid it
00:29:09 they cause it to happen.
00:29:11 That's like the plot of every That's So Raven episode.
00:29:14 How has nobody in the Marvel Universe
00:29:17 ever seen an episode of That's So Raven?
00:29:20 So that's basically what the Civil War II divide is about.
00:29:24 It's about the superheroes who have seen That's So Raven
00:29:28 versus the superheroes who haven't seen That's So Raven.
00:29:32 And don't know how this fucking trope works.
00:29:35 So Thanos kicks everyone's ass.
00:29:37 War Machine is fucking dead.
00:29:39 She-Hulk is in like critical condition.
00:29:42 So Tony Stark is so fucking pissed off
00:29:45 that his best buddy, Rody, died
00:29:47 in this ill-conceived cock-a-manie pre-cog battle idea
00:29:53 that he basically says, fuck you Carol, we're fighting now.
00:29:56 Everyone's fighting.
00:29:57 Meanwhile, Carol also has to go and find Bruce Banner
00:30:01 and tell him that his cousin She-Hulk
00:30:03 is in critical condition because of her.
00:30:06 And nobody wants that job
00:30:08 because if Bruce Banner gets mad,
00:30:10 if he finds out that we fucked up so bad
00:30:13 and got his cousin hurt,
00:30:14 he's gonna hulk out, he's gonna throw a big fit, right?
00:30:16 Even though Bruce Banner has actually been cured
00:30:20 by the Hulk in continuity for like a year,
00:30:23 they're still paranoid about it
00:30:24 because they're a bunch of fucking idiots.
00:30:26 So they're going to confront the Hulk
00:30:28 and tell him, you know, what's going on.
00:30:30 But then also, the Ulysses kid has another fucking premonition
00:30:34 and he has a premonition that the Hulk
00:30:36 is going to kill everyone.
00:30:38 So here's what Carol does
00:30:40 because the only way that this story can even happen
00:30:44 is by making one of the characters a complete retard.
00:30:48 So they made Captain Marvel a complete fucking retard.
00:30:53 Everything that she does in this series
00:30:55 defies all logic and rationale.
00:30:58 It's all completely insane.
00:31:00 Her actions are the actions of a fucking madman
00:31:04 and it's baffling that anyone would even take her side at all.
00:31:08 So the situation is that they have to go tell Bruce Banner
00:31:12 that they got She-Hulk nearly killed
00:31:15 and they have a vision that says the Hulk
00:31:18 is going to fucking kill everyone.
00:31:21 And they already know from the first vision
00:31:24 that trying to prevent the visions
00:31:26 is exactly what makes the visions happen.
00:31:29 So you'd think the answer is pretty fucking clear.
00:31:31 Leave Bruce Banner the fuck alone.
00:31:34 Instead, Captain Marvel shows up on his doorstep
00:31:37 with like an entire army of pissed off superheroes behind her
00:31:41 ready to like intimidate Bruce Banner
00:31:44 into coming with him quietly.
00:31:46 What the fuck?
00:31:47 You don't intimidate Bruce fucking Banner.
00:31:49 You don't even try that.
00:31:51 That's a goofy idea.
00:31:52 So they're basically antagonizing Bruce Banner
00:31:55 into becoming the Hulk.
00:31:57 And he's saying,
00:31:58 what are you fucking people talking about?
00:32:00 I haven't been the Hulk in like a year, okay?
00:32:02 I haven't had, you know, a Hulk episode in a while.
00:32:05 I'm totally okay.
00:32:07 You're telling me that you got She-Hulk all fucked up
00:32:11 for no reason.
00:32:12 Clearly I'm pissed off,
00:32:14 but as you can see, I'm not hulking out.
00:32:16 So why do you have a bunch of people here
00:32:18 trying to intimidate me?
00:32:20 So they have this fucking, you know, conflict.
00:32:23 And long story short,
00:32:25 they're so worried.
00:32:27 They're so paranoid that Bruce is going to hulk out
00:32:29 and kill everyone.
00:32:30 That Hawkeye, who is sitting over in a tree,
00:32:33 lets loose an arrow,
00:32:35 flip, and you know,
00:32:37 shoots Bruce in the head,
00:32:38 and Bruce Banner's dead.
00:32:39 They killed Bruce Banner.
00:32:41 So then there's a whole big thing.
00:32:42 It's like the trial of Hawkeye,
00:32:44 you know, trying to, you know,
00:32:46 and Hawkeye reveals that Bruce requested him
00:32:49 to kill him if he ever was going to hulk out again.
00:32:51 And Hawkeye says that, hey, in good faith,
00:32:53 I'm Hawkeye.
00:32:54 I have better eyes than you.
00:32:56 I saw a little flick of green in his eyes.
00:32:58 I thought he was going to become the Hulk, you know?
00:33:00 I had no choice.
00:33:01 He told me if he ever became the Hulk again
00:33:03 to fucking kill him, so I did what he asked.
00:33:05 So, you know, it's a whole big trial.
00:33:07 And Hawkeye is found innocent,
00:33:10 I think.
00:33:11 I'm a little hate.
00:33:12 I'm pretty sure he's found innocent,
00:33:13 but you know, there's another point.
00:33:14 Fuck, what else fucking happened
00:33:16 in this Godforsaken story?
00:33:18 Anyways, because of everything that's fucking happened,
00:33:20 Tony Stark and Captain Marvel fucking hate each other.
00:33:23 And yeah, and it's Civil War II.
00:33:26 All the superheroes are going to fucking fight each other
00:33:28 again over stupid bullshit.
00:33:30 And the conflict is so stupid,
00:33:32 because, like,
00:33:34 in the first issue,
00:33:37 Captain Marvel's side is proven
00:33:40 to be objectively wrong.
00:33:42 Right?
00:33:43 Like, she gets the pre-cog,
00:33:44 she gets the vision of, like, Thanos
00:33:47 beating everyone up,
00:33:48 so she goes to attack Thanos
00:33:50 and gets beat up by Thanos.
00:33:53 In the first issue,
00:33:55 the dilemma is fucking solved.
00:33:57 Well, okay, now we know that this is that
00:34:00 Surraven rules.
00:34:01 We know that if we fucking try to prevent these visions,
00:34:04 they're just gonna be forced into fruition.
00:34:06 We're going to make them come to pass
00:34:08 by trying to prevent them.
00:34:10 That's how time travel stories always work.
00:34:12 Have you never seen a fucking time travel story in your life?
00:34:15 Holy shit.
00:34:16 It literally happens in the first issue.
00:34:18 Like, the dilemma is over.
00:34:20 The problem is solved.
00:34:21 The issue is complete.
00:34:22 Nobody would be insane enough
00:34:24 to still be on her side
00:34:26 after the very first vision that they saw
00:34:29 proved that her side was fucking retarded.
00:34:32 Beyond a shadow of a doubt.
00:34:34 Like, it's one thing where it's like
00:34:37 in the first Civil War,
00:34:38 where people can argue both sides.
00:34:40 Like, you know, some people have been...
00:34:42 Some people read Civil War I
00:34:45 or they watch the Civil War movie
00:34:47 and they're legitimately on Tony Stark's side
00:34:49 with the Registration Act.
00:34:50 Some people watch it and they're legitimately on Cap's side.
00:34:53 I can't imagine anyone being on Carol's side
00:34:56 in Civil War II
00:34:57 because the story itself
00:35:00 goes out of its way to expressly show
00:35:03 that her side is objectively fucking wrong.
00:35:06 Holy shit.
00:35:08 This is fucking terrible.
00:35:10 So anyways, it's Civil War II
00:35:12 and all the superheroes are fighting each other
00:35:14 and eventually the kid gets another fucking vision
00:35:17 and this time his vision is of Miles Morales
00:35:20 who is the little black Mexican Spider-Man.
00:35:23 There's two Spider-Men now.
00:35:25 I don't know why he couldn't have just had it like his own name.
00:35:27 But he has a vision of a little baby Spider-Man
00:35:31 killing Captain America
00:35:33 and that fucking sends everyone into panic mode
00:35:36 and so that's where this issue starts off
00:35:38 with them dealing from the fallout
00:35:40 of this new vision that they've had
00:35:42 of Miles Morales killing Captain America
00:35:46 and it's really stupid
00:35:48 and it's really fucking shit.
00:35:52 It's shit.
00:35:54 God damn it.
00:35:56 God fucking damn it.
00:35:58 I hate event comics.
00:35:59 I'm so sick of this shit.
00:36:00 I'm so sick of Marvel's bullshit
00:36:02 every year with this shit.
00:36:04 Oh my god.
00:36:06 I need tea.
00:36:08 So they get this vision that Spider-Man's going to kill Captain America
00:36:11 and so everyone's freaking out
00:36:13 and Carol is doing her fucking minority report bullshit.
00:36:17 She's like,
00:36:18 okay Spider-Man you're going to come quietly
00:36:20 we're going to arrest you.
00:36:21 This is like a 15 year old kid.
00:36:23 She's basically gone full supervillain at this point.
00:36:26 She's arresting children
00:36:28 on account of some fuckboy in humans
00:36:30 goofy nightmares.
00:36:32 So she's about to beat up Spider-Man
00:36:36 and arrest him and all that
00:36:38 but then Captain America's like Carol shut the fuck up
00:36:40 sit the fuck down you crazy ass bitch
00:36:42 and Miss Marvel
00:36:44 remember Captain Marvel used to be Miss Marvel
00:36:48 but she bestowed the name Miss Marvel
00:36:50 onto Kamala Khan
00:36:52 who is a teenager
00:36:54 and so she is Miss Marvel
00:36:56 and she was like Captain Marvel's protege, right?
00:36:59 Captain Marvel gave her the name Miss Marvel
00:37:01 Captain Marvel is about to, you know,
00:37:04 arrest Little Spidey
00:37:06 but then Little Marvel, Miss Marvel
00:37:08 she grabs her with her giant hand
00:37:10 she can stretch her body
00:37:12 so she's got a giant hand sometimes
00:37:14 she grabs her with a giant hand she says fuck you
00:37:16 this is crazy
00:37:18 you've gone bad man
00:37:22 so you know Miss Marvel
00:37:24 so they all jump ship
00:37:26 all the little teeny bopper Avengers
00:37:28 jump ship
00:37:30 the Iron Man side
00:37:32 and Captain America
00:37:34 has a talk with Spider-Man
00:37:36 he says okay son don't
00:37:38 don't freak out
00:37:40 and then Thor
00:37:42 not the real Thor, the fucking woman Thor
00:37:44 Jane Foster, she flies
00:37:46 Little Spider-Man out there
00:37:48 God none of these fucking superheroes
00:37:50 are even the actual superheroes anymore
00:37:52 every fucking character's name
00:37:54 that you talk about when you talk about Marvel
00:37:56 you have to put an asterisk
00:37:58 next to every fucking thing that you say
00:38:00 it makes everything you're saying
00:38:02 take ten times longer
00:38:04 because you have to add the caveat of
00:38:06 and then Spider-Man, not Peter Parker
00:38:08 the little Spider-Man, the black Mexican Spider-Man
00:38:10 does this and then Thor takes him
00:38:12 and flies away, not the real Thor that you know
00:38:14 I'm talking about the girl Thor
00:38:16 Jane Foster, she used to be Thor's girlfriend
00:38:18 she had cancer and now she is Thor
00:38:20 because Nick Fury whispered a secret into his ear
00:38:22 that made him unworthy of Mjolnir
00:38:24 so now fucking blah blah blah blah
00:38:26 and then Ms. Marvel grabbed Captain Marvel
00:38:28 because Ms. Marvel is the Ms. Marvel
00:38:30 because Captain Marvel used to be Ms. Marvel
00:38:32 and god damn it Marvel I fucking hate you
00:38:34 fuck
00:38:36 just give these characters their own fucking names
00:38:38 if you want to be diverse
00:38:40 then create new superheroes
00:38:42 don't fucking co-opt
00:38:44 names of superheroes that already
00:38:46 fucking exist
00:38:48 these two Spider-Man swinging around
00:38:50 it's fucking confusing
00:38:52 you piece of shit
00:38:54 I hate you Marvel
00:38:56 I fucking hate them
00:38:58 so Captain Marvel is off on some
00:39:00 shield, helicarrier
00:39:02 sulking like a little whiny baby
00:39:04 because her crazy weird
00:39:06 evil supervillain plans are falling
00:39:08 through and everyone on her side is
00:39:10 abandoning her cause
00:39:12 Black Panther
00:39:14 abandons her side and he goes and joins
00:39:16 Captain America's side
00:39:18 Black Panther has one of the goofiest
00:39:20 lines I've ever seen in this comic
00:39:22 where he's saying
00:39:24 I'm sorry Carol I can't be on your side
00:39:26 of this conflict anymore
00:39:28 because you know
00:39:30 when you're on the
00:39:32 opposite side of Steve Rogers
00:39:34 you're usually
00:39:36 in the wrong
00:39:38 Captain America is usually a pretty moral guy
00:39:40 so when it comes to moral issues
00:39:42 I want
00:39:44 to be on the side of Captain America
00:39:46 well mother fucker
00:39:48 if that's how you feel
00:39:50 then why weren't you on his
00:39:52 side from the beginning
00:39:54 what the fuck kind of a
00:39:56 what the fuck
00:39:58 kind of a revelation is that
00:40:00 it's not like he saw the carnage
00:40:02 or saw what was going on
00:40:04 and said you know what
00:40:06 I'm starting to think that maybe Carol's ideas
00:40:08 about this whole pre-cog
00:40:10 you know
00:40:12 kind of justice thing
00:40:14 I think maybe she's going off the deep end
00:40:16 it wasn't like he slowly saw what was
00:40:18 happening and came to acknowledge
00:40:20 this he just suddenly
00:40:22 remembered oh yeah
00:40:24 Captain America's on the other team
00:40:26 well he's usually right
00:40:28 how could I forget
00:40:30 what the fuck
00:40:36 and then at the end fucking little spider-man
00:40:38 goes to the fucking
00:40:40 capital steps of
00:40:42 Washington and he stands there
00:40:44 some shit
00:40:46 I don't fucking know
00:40:48 oh fuck this is
00:40:50 terrible this is so fucking
00:40:52 bad
00:40:54 why do they do this
00:40:56 I'm looking at this fuck I'm looking at these pages
00:40:58 right now and every time
00:41:00 I keep remembering other things
00:41:02 about this comic that are so fucking weird
00:41:04 like at this point the only
00:41:06 people still
00:41:08 on Captain Marvel's side
00:41:10 are
00:41:12 Storm for some fucking reason
00:41:14 Jean Grey
00:41:16 not the real Jean Grey
00:41:18 not the original Jean Grey
00:41:20 the new Jean Grey who is actually
00:41:22 the younger Jean Grey from the past
00:41:24 transplanted into the present
00:41:26 from Beast because he made a time machine
00:41:28 to bring the original young baby
00:41:30 X-Men to the present
00:41:32 that teach Scott Summers a lesson
00:41:34 because the X-Men were fugitives for a while
00:41:36 because of all the fallout from one of their big stupid
00:41:38 events Avengers vs X-Men
00:41:40 in 2011 so Beast
00:41:42 hated Cyclops and he wanted
00:41:44 he had some weird goofy plan
00:41:46 that somehow bringing Jean
00:41:48 Grey as a teenager back into
00:41:50 the present with oh Jesus
00:41:52 so she's got fucking teenage
00:41:54 Jean Grey there on her side
00:41:56 she's got Storm there who
00:41:58 Storm has a fucking Mohawk because she had
00:42:00 a Mohawk in the 80s and some
00:42:02 Jackass at Marvel decided to
00:42:04 retro and bring the Mohawk back
00:42:06 for some reason even though it looks
00:42:08 fucking goofy as hell so she's
00:42:10 got fucking she's got fucking
00:42:12 phony teenage teeny
00:42:14 bopper Jean Grey from the 60s
00:42:16 she's got stupid looking
00:42:18 Mohawk Storm and she's
00:42:20 got the Guardians of the Galaxy on her team
00:42:22 but the Guardians
00:42:24 of the Galaxy are so fucked up
00:42:26 the rock that's like like okay
00:42:28 Groot's there Peter Quills there
00:42:30 and Rocket Raccoon's there
00:42:32 Dora and Drax so everybody that you know from
00:42:34 the movie but also I don't know
00:42:36 what the fuck is going on in Marvel
00:42:38 Ben Grimm the thing is now
00:42:40 part of the Guardians of the Galaxy
00:42:42 Shadowcat is there Kitty Pride
00:42:44 from the X-Men what's going on
00:42:46 I don't know what's
00:42:48 happening with the Guardians of the Galaxy
00:42:50 I don't know why fucking Kitty Pride
00:42:52 and Ben Grimm are currently on that team
00:42:54 but they are and so
00:42:56 that's basically all the people
00:42:58 who are left on
00:43:00 Captain Marvel's insane
00:43:02 supervillain team
00:43:04 the Guardians of the Galaxy
00:43:06 featuring Ben Grimm and Kitty Pride
00:43:08 stupid looking idiot Mohawk
00:43:10 Storm from the 80s and
00:43:12 stupid looking teeny bopper
00:43:14 bitch face mindrapes
00:43:16 people without permission and turns them gay
00:43:18 Jean Grey from the 1960s
00:43:20 Jean Gay should be her name
00:43:22 because that's all she does
00:43:24 she's a bad she's an evil little girl
00:43:26 she turns people gay
00:43:28 as the great philosopher
00:43:30 me once said
00:43:32 you so gay
00:43:34 you're making me gay
00:43:36 why is Kitty Pride
00:43:38 in the Guardians
00:43:40 why is she one of the Guardians of the Galaxy
00:43:42 what is happening
00:43:44 you know there's this weird panel here
00:43:46 where Carol is sulking
00:43:48 because nobody wants to be on her fucking
00:43:50 supervillain crew anymore
00:43:52 and fucking Peter Quill
00:43:54 comes up behind her
00:43:56 and he says you know what
00:43:58 fuck them you're right
00:44:00 you're absolutely right
00:44:02 about this whole thing
00:44:04 if you can prevent anything bad
00:44:06 from happening then you have to try to do it
00:44:08 you have to do everything you can
00:44:10 to prevent disasters and tragedies
00:44:12 from happening
00:44:14 well you know
00:44:16 that's a great speech there Star-Lord
00:44:18 except for the fact that she's
00:44:20 causing the things to happen
00:44:22 she trying to change the bad
00:44:24 things is causing the bad things to happen
00:44:26 this was established in the first issue
00:44:28 so why the fuck
00:44:30 did this conflict even make it
00:44:32 to six issues
00:44:34 it should have been over at the first issue
00:44:36 you're all crazy you're all idiots
00:44:38 you're all out of character
00:44:40 fucking badly written fanfic
00:44:42 idiots
00:44:44 oh god
00:44:46 you know these are beloved characters
00:44:48 everybody loves Star-Lord
00:44:50 why is he suddenly a fucking idiot
00:44:52 why is he on this team of supervillains
00:44:54 why are any of these
00:44:56 beloved characters on this team
00:44:58 of supervillains why is Carol
00:45:00 a fucking supervillain
00:45:02 okay they're gonna have a fucking
00:45:04 Captain Marvel movie in a couple years
00:45:06 they're gonna be wanting
00:45:08 they're gonna want a push Captain Marvel
00:45:10 as a hero they're gonna want everyone to
00:45:12 fucking love her right
00:45:14 so why are they making her a fucking crazy
00:45:16 tyrant who arrest people
00:45:18 for future crimes
00:45:20 you know Marvel's all about fucking diversity
00:45:22 everyone's all about
00:45:24 we need female superheroes
00:45:26 there's not enough female superheroes
00:45:28 for little girls to look up to
00:45:30 so we gotta make a Captain Marvel movie
00:45:32 hey little girls
00:45:34 do you want to
00:45:36 be like Captain Marvel when you grow up
00:45:38 remember that she's a fucking
00:45:40 tyrant who arrests
00:45:42 children for future
00:45:44 crimes that they haven't committed yet
00:45:46 wow what an inspiring superhero
00:45:48 for little girls to emulate
00:45:50 thank god we have all this
00:45:52 diversity now
00:45:54 so that we can have
00:45:56 female superheroes and then
00:45:58 ruin them with terrible comic
00:46:00 book stories that make no sense
00:46:02 and make them seem like irredeemable
00:46:04 monsters and idiots
00:46:06 holy shit
00:46:08 and I could almost understand
00:46:10 why Captain Marvel would feel this way
00:46:12 about it and want to be
00:46:14 you know misgovernment
00:46:16 arrest people for future crimes
00:46:18 because she does come from like a militaristic
00:46:20 background
00:46:22 she was like an air force military lady
00:46:24 but fucking star lord
00:46:26 I mean you know
00:46:28 star lord he's basically Han Solo
00:46:30 he's a
00:46:32 galactic scamp a space pirate
00:46:34 a scoundrel a scruffy nerf herder
00:46:36 a fucking rogue
00:46:38 he's a guy in a goofy red jacket
00:46:40 and a weird looking bug mask
00:46:42 who flies around the galaxy
00:46:44 fucking green alien girls
00:46:46 and who defeats super villains
00:46:48 by dancing like an idiot
00:46:50 to 70s funk pop
00:46:52 it makes no sense
00:46:54 for him to be on Captain Marvel's side here
00:46:56 and maybe I'm wrong
00:46:58 maybe there's some aspect of his
00:47:00 personality that I don't know about
00:47:02 because I haven't read enough guardians of the galaxy comics
00:47:04 I've only seen the movie
00:47:06 something that sets some kind of precedence
00:47:08 for why he would be down to clown
00:47:10 with this insane fascist
00:47:12 ideology of arresting people
00:47:14 for future crimes which seems to go
00:47:16 against like the very basis
00:47:18 of the character I don't know
00:47:20 but personally I don't fucking buy it
00:47:22 imagine the movies
00:47:24 trying to get away with this shit
00:47:26 like turning all of these beloved characters
00:47:28 and superheroes
00:47:30 into a bunch of bumbling fascists
00:47:32 as though the audience
00:47:34 is still somehow supposed to find
00:47:36 these characters likeable
00:47:38 like imagine that this is guardians of the galaxy
00:47:40 2 star lord is going around
00:47:42 with Captain Marvel busting into people's
00:47:44 houses and arresting them
00:47:46 for future crimes
00:47:48 try and put a Jackson 5 soundtrack to that shit
00:47:50 see how fucking heartwarming it is
00:47:52 a fucking montage
00:47:54 of star lord breaking into people's
00:47:56 houses and swatting people
00:47:58 A B C
00:48:00 it's as easy as 1 2 3
00:48:02 as Batista's power bombing
00:48:04 your fucking grandma through a coffee table
00:48:06 because she might
00:48:08 shoplift at some point in the future
00:48:12 she might be at the
00:48:14 she might be at the self checkout
00:48:16 and forget to pay for an apple
00:48:18 so we
00:48:20 gotta fucking Groot Stomp that bitch
00:48:22 in the spine
00:48:24 grandma can't get away with it again
00:48:26 this is a job for the guardians
00:48:28 of the galaxy
00:48:30 candy girl
00:48:32 you are my world
00:48:36 god every fucking Jackson 5 song
00:48:38 is the same
00:48:40 I'm just picturing this movie now
00:48:42 of just nonstop
00:48:44 horrible brutal
00:48:46 fascist violence
00:48:48 it's all in black and white like Schindler's
00:48:50 list but still set to the
00:48:52 soundtrack of the first movie
00:48:54 I
00:48:56 hooked on a feeling
00:48:58 it's just like a slow motion
00:49:00 nightmare of the guardians
00:49:02 of the galaxy busting into a
00:49:04 kindergarten class and shooting up
00:49:06 the place because they got a vision
00:49:08 that one of the kids might push
00:49:10 another one of the kids off a swing set
00:49:12 at the playground so the guardians of the galaxy
00:49:14 are bursting into a kindergarten classroom
00:49:16 and just shooting up the place
00:49:18 you know the hot kindly teacher
00:49:20 in her early 20s rocket raccoon
00:49:22 puts a fucking bullet in her head
00:49:24 Drax is Batista bombing
00:49:26 kids all these kids are getting
00:49:28 mangled and crippled and killed
00:49:30 massive bloodshed
00:49:32 and once again
00:49:34 the day is saved
00:49:36 thanks to the guardians of the galaxy
00:49:42 fuck this comic
00:49:44 okay
00:49:46 god damn
00:49:48 I think that's enough Civil War 2
00:49:50 talk
00:49:52 Christ this podcast is going long
00:49:54 I definitely do not
00:49:56 intend for every panel cast
00:49:58 to go this long
00:50:00 because Jesus it's been fucking two days
00:50:02 I've been recording this now
00:50:04 what's next
00:50:06 I still have a couple more comics I want to get to
00:50:08 that were cool this week
00:50:10 fucking uh okay
00:50:12 so the next
00:50:14 comic that I read this week
00:50:16 I'm fucking sliding all over the place in this fucking chair
00:50:18 why do they make chairs
00:50:20 with wheels on them what is the point of this
00:50:24 fuck
00:50:26 Jesus
00:50:28 oh lord help me Jesus I'm
00:50:30 tipping over I'm tipping
00:50:32 come on
00:50:34 fuck it
00:50:42 okay
00:50:44 ugh
00:50:46 and I wonder why these things go long
00:50:48 okay the next comic that I read
00:50:50 was Miss Marvel
00:50:52 Miss Marvel
00:50:54 number 12
00:50:56 and um this was actually
00:50:58 this was a good comic
00:51:00 this was a nice little
00:51:02 heartwarming a good
00:51:04 decent little kind of one shot
00:51:06 in the midst of this
00:51:08 you know epic retardation
00:51:10 of Civil War 2
00:51:12 that is sort of fucking up
00:51:14 every other comic on the stands
00:51:16 in the midst of all that there is
00:51:18 still room for
00:51:20 little character stories having to do with it
00:51:22 uh you know branching out
00:51:24 from this conflict that
00:51:26 in and of themselves
00:51:28 are decent
00:51:30 so uh Miss Marvel
00:51:32 this character is another
00:51:34 relatively new character
00:51:36 she's only been around for a couple of years
00:51:38 um Kamala Khan
00:51:40 was a little
00:51:42 Pakistani teenager living in New Jersey
00:51:44 and she got superpowers
00:51:46 and her hero was Miss Marvel
00:51:48 and she idolized all the superheroes
00:51:50 but particularly
00:51:52 Captain Marvel
00:51:54 so Captain Marvel said you can call yourself
00:51:56 Miss Marvel I can I'll give you the name
00:51:58 she she earned the name
00:52:00 Miss Marvel and so
00:52:02 her role in the Marvel Universe
00:52:04 is sort of like the forefront
00:52:06 of the next generation of superheroes
00:52:08 even though the problem with that
00:52:10 is that the next generation of superheroes
00:52:12 will never be
00:52:14 the current generation of superheroes
00:52:16 so they're kind of an eternally
00:52:18 unfulfilled promise because of the way
00:52:20 the comics are you know
00:52:22 Spider-Man and Iron Man and Captain America
00:52:24 and the main guard they're always going to be around
00:52:26 so when you have characters like this whose
00:52:28 purpose is that they're the younger generation
00:52:30 of superheroes
00:52:32 it's kind of an inherently
00:52:34 unfulfilling idea because
00:52:36 it's never really going to come to fruition
00:52:38 no matter how much time passes
00:52:40 they're always going to be
00:52:42 the younger generation of superheroes
00:52:44 you know that's how you end up with a teen titan
00:52:46 situation where
00:52:48 nobody knows what to do with like Beast Boy
00:52:50 and Raven and Starfire so now it's
00:52:52 they've been around for like fuckin 80 years
00:52:54 but somehow they're still teenagers
00:52:56 because you know they get
00:52:58 stuck in that next generation
00:53:00 teenager hole
00:53:02 and not the kind of teenager hole I like
00:53:04 HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
00:53:34 HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
00:54:04 Ben, one of the more successful ones, she's one of the few of that type of character that has
00:54:09 succeeded in being her own character and feeling like she has an actual personality and a reason
00:54:15 for being, and she's popular. People like her. Um, her and X-23, who's currently Wolverine,
00:54:23 those are the only two, I think, of the diversity Avengers that have been well-received, that seem
00:54:30 like they are actual characters with their own stories and their own, you get what I'm saying.
00:54:36 So the story of Ms. Marvel, number 12, is that this whole Civil War 2 event thing has been going
00:54:42 on and all of its ramifications are ruining everything. Um, Ms. Marvel has lost faith in
00:54:49 her idol, Captain Marvel, because she sees that Carol is turning into a fascist lunatic with this
00:54:57 pre-cog shit. So she says, fuck you to Captain Marvel, she strikes out on her own, and also she's
00:55:02 feeling bad and down in the dumps, because her best buddy, whose name I forget, best buddy,
00:55:08 Buddy Buddieson, is his name, is um, in the hospital, he got hurt in some superhero battle,
00:55:13 he goes, I don't want to hang out with you, we can't be friends anymore, because I'm sick of
00:55:18 getting sucked up into your superhero bullshit, or something like that, I don't know, but basically
00:55:23 she's feeling real down in the dumps right now, she's taking her lumps right now, she's
00:55:30 turned her back on her idol, Captain Marvel, her best friend don't want her no more, she's got nowhere
00:55:35 to go, she's feeling lost, she's feeling vulnerable, so this issue is sort of like a little one-shot
00:55:41 finding herself issue, she's traveling abroad, she's trying to find the real America in Pakistan,
00:55:49 she's getting on a little plane, and uh, she's going to her ancestral home of Pakistan, all by
00:55:57 herself, she's going to spend a few weeks hanging out with her grandma, and her extended family,
00:56:02 and just try to find herself, gotta find the real America man, you know that's the problem with all
00:56:08 of these event comics, all of these superheroes, you know, the civil wars, the Avengers versus X-Men,
00:56:13 all of these goofy manufactured conflicts, it just comes off like all of these superheroes and
00:56:20 beloved characters have forgotten the face of their fathers and lost sight of the real America,
00:56:26 and I want it back, we gotta bring the real America back to comics, that's my platform, that's what
00:56:32 I'm running on when I run for president in a decade or so, or a couple decades, when I'm old enough,
00:56:38 when I'm fucking 89 years old, that seems to be the minimum age for a presidential candidate in
00:56:45 this country, make comics great again, find the real America, put it back in my comics, so Kamala's
00:56:52 going through the airport, she's having a shitty time, you know, she's getting hassled by airport
00:56:56 security, she's looking all glum, she's looking all sad, she gets to Pakistan, she meets her family,
00:57:02 and it's so, it's so heartwarming, you know, seeing this reunion with all of her extended
00:57:08 relatives and stuff, I mean, we the reader, we've never seen these characters before, we don't know
00:57:12 these characters, we're being introduced to them, but it effectively feels like a sort of homecoming,
00:57:20 like, oh I haven't been in Pakistan since I was a little girl and I'm back and I'm with my grandma,
00:57:24 my abuela, that's a Pakistani word right, abuela, and it's a really great little character story,
00:57:30 because as she's hanging out here in Pakistan and she's trying to get her head straight and
00:57:35 ruminating on all of this, you know, tragic stuff that's been happening around her with all the
00:57:39 superheroes in America fighting each other, it's really going into, like, her character and her
00:57:44 personality and her unique little struggles, and she talks a little bit about, like, when she's
00:57:49 conviting with her abuela and she says, in New Jersey, I always feel like I'm a foreigner,
00:57:56 but here in Pakistan, I feel like I'm too American, so she's got that whole, you know,
00:58:00 ethnic American, caught between two worlds thing, you know, I can sympathize because I myself have
00:58:07 always felt caught between two worlds because of my ethnicity, I'm half Irish and half French
00:58:14 Canadian, so part of me just wants to feel white, but the other part of me just wants to feel really
00:58:19 white, and I feel like I don't belong anywhere, if only I had some of that minority privilege,
00:58:26 that the blacks are always lording over me, oh, look at me, I'm black, I feel like I belong to
00:58:34 a community, you don't know how good you have it, we whites are alone, damn it, we're cast into the
00:58:40 world, derelict, and without a place to truly call our own, there's no white superheroes anymore,
00:58:48 there's no representation for my people, there's nowhere for us in today's America,
00:58:55 and that's why we gotta find the real America, that's why we gotta make a great
00:58:57 again, that's why I'm voting for Trump, okay, the next comic I read, oh Jesus,
00:59:03 I just ate, I took another break and I ate a shitload of ramen, I ate so much fucking ramen,
00:59:12 the most ramen that's ever been put into a growing boy in the history of the world,
00:59:17 oh god, let me lay down, I need to lay down on the couch, oh Jesus,
00:59:29 oh, I just, I recently discovered that my microphone, the cord on my microphone is long
00:59:40 enough that it can reach to my couch and also my mattress, so this is gonna change my fucking life,
00:59:49 people, this, I can already tell, this is a revolution in podcasting technology right here,
00:59:55 you know, I'm sorry, I can't bring the pop filter over here, so there might be a little bit of,
01:00:00 you know, that going on, but aside from that, this feels, this feels good, I could definitely
01:00:09 get used to this, oh god, oh there's so much fucking ramen in me, oh, okay,
01:00:21 just a second, let me fucking get my brain back,
01:00:29 it is recording right, that's the one bad part, I can't see if it's actually recording or not,
01:00:34 so everything that I'm saying, I mean, I can't see the computer from here, so for all I know,
01:00:40 for all I know that I could just be talking to a microphone that's not even,
01:00:45 that's not even on right now,
01:00:50 what is going on outside, I hear thunder and lightning and motorcycles or some shit,
01:00:56 god damn, the wind is howling out there like fucking sleepy hollow, it sounds like the,
01:01:01 the sounds of the planet screaming in Final Fantasy VII, I swear to god, I can hear that exact sound
01:01:06 effect outside my window, okay, so next up is my comic of the week, the best comic of all the
01:01:27 comics that came out this week, it is, none other than, I'm gonna make a drum roll with my feet on
01:01:36 the coffee table over here, this is my drum roll, the comic of the week, this is a bad drum roll,
01:01:45 the vision number 12, yes, the final issue of what has been a momentous run, a story for the ages,
01:01:59 a tour de force, a legend, a saga on par with some of the greats, this has been like consistently the
01:02:09 most impressive comic coming out recently and it just finally had its last issue, the story has
01:02:15 been wrapped up and what a story it has been, so if you don't know who the vision is, the vision is
01:02:23 the data of the Marvel universe, he's a robot man who wishes that he could be more like a man man,
01:02:29 he is the Avengers resident robot dude, he was created by Ultron, oh my god, I'm gonna shit my
01:02:40 pants, oh my god, I'm gonna have a baby, a shit baby, oh, so the villain of the second Avengers
01:02:49 movie, Ultron, the big scary robot guy, in the movie he was created by Tony Stark, but in the comics,
01:02:56 Ultron was created by Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, one of the founding members of the Avengers,
01:03:03 Hank Pym was in the Ant-Man movie, but he was not Ant-Man, Scott Lang was the Ant-Man in the
01:03:10 Ant-Man movie because he's the current Ant-Man, the Paul Rudd character was like an apprentice of
01:03:14 Hank Pym in the movies, there's little tiny differences in the movies in the comics, but you
01:03:17 know you can wrap your head around them if you really make an effort to, if you read the shit,
01:03:22 I don't know if I can, but so Ultron was created by Hank Pym, he was like the first like real
01:03:28 artificial intelligence, but Ultron turned out to be a fucking asshole, he was he was a petulant
01:03:37 entitled bastard, he wanted to destroy the Avengers, destroy the world, he was a villain,
01:03:45 he fought the Avengers a million times, eventually Ultron made a robot of his own,
01:03:52 this robot would go on to become the vision, and so in an ironic twist of fate, Hank Pym creates
01:03:59 Ultron who turns out to be evil, then Ultron creates the vision to further his evil agenda,
01:04:05 but the vision turns out to be good, and the vision joins the Avengers and becomes a superhero,
01:04:11 one of the most beloved members of the Avengers and saved the world 37 times over his career as a
01:04:16 superhero, as he often reiterates throughout this series, I am the vision of the Avengers, I have
01:04:22 saved the world 37 times, 37 in a row, the vision is not totally a robot, he's not technically an
01:04:32 android, he is what's called a synthesoid in the Marvel universe, so I think he's a you know
01:04:41 kind of an android, but he does have some human characteristics, you know his skin is that sort
01:04:46 of metallic pink color, but it is skin, um he does presumably have a penis, I'm guessing, I mean he
01:04:54 was married, he was married to the Scarlet Witch for a number of years, and they did have children,
01:05:00 so I'm assuming he's got a dick, fucking robot dick, fucking android dong, give Wanda some of that
01:05:10 swinging android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android
01:05:23 dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android
01:05:33 dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android
01:05:45 dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android
01:05:55 dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android dong, android
01:06:15 dong. Synthesoid winner, he's more like a sexazoid is what he is, he he goes all night, he makes the
01:06:22 He makes the ladies scream!
01:06:28 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
01:06:29 So that's who the vision is and what he's about, basically.
01:06:31 He's a peace-loving, philosophical, you know, compassionate, stoic robot guy with an Android
01:06:40 DONG!
01:06:42 Personally, the character has never connected with me that well, because, you know, it's
01:06:47 hard as a reader not to just see him as a robot.
01:06:51 I think the movie did a good job of stressing how human he is, but up until that point, you
01:06:57 know, it's very easy to play the old Avengers game on Sega Genesis or to see him in a comic
01:07:03 and just go, well, yeah, I know Captain America and Iron Man, but who's this, uh, he's just
01:07:08 a robot guy, right?
01:07:09 I don't get it.
01:07:10 Like, well, it's very easy to not understand the character vision, and I didn't really
01:07:13 understand the character of the vision for a long time.
01:07:16 I mean, like I said, he's basically just the Marvel Universe's version of data, but
01:07:21 there's already a data in my mind, so there wasn't really enough room to love another
01:07:26 android character, I guess.
01:07:28 It's already full.
01:07:29 I've got data up there.
01:07:30 I've got Android 18.
01:07:32 She's a babe.
01:07:33 And I think what it really comes down to, the reason why the vision never impressed
01:07:38 me in the past, is because he just never had his own series that was good or interesting.
01:07:44 He never had any.
01:07:45 There never seemed to be any interesting stories about the vision.
01:07:50 He was always just kind of there.
01:07:52 He always, he's always just the robot guy in the Avengers.
01:07:56 He never came off like a flawed character before.
01:07:59 He never came off that three-dimensional.
01:08:01 He always just came off to me as, you know, he's stoic and he's calm and he is super
01:08:06 powerful and he's just there.
01:08:09 My point is I was a fool.
01:08:11 Like so many before me, I was caught up in my own humanity.
01:08:16 I was so arrogant about humanity, I could not see the pathos of a robot man, blinded
01:08:25 by the outside, judging a book by the cover, judging a synthesoid, not by the content of
01:08:32 his character, but by the, the robots, the parts of him that are robots.
01:08:40 You, you, whatever.
01:08:41 Fuck this.
01:08:42 Abandon this whole joke.
01:08:43 You get what I'm saying.
01:08:45 I'm abandoning this bit.
01:08:46 Get to the fucking point already.
01:08:49 You're yelling at your fucking computer screen.
01:08:50 I hear you.
01:08:51 I hear you.
01:08:52 So, so what this story has been about.
01:08:58 It's over now.
01:08:59 You can read the whole thing.
01:09:00 It's a self-contained, it's 12 issues.
01:09:02 It's a, it's an, it's a complete story and it's so goddamn good.
01:09:08 It really feels like this character, if you didn't appreciate or understand the character
01:09:13 before, read this and you'll have a totally new appreciation for the vision because he
01:09:17 finally has like a defining quintessential story, you know, like it's so easy to point
01:09:26 to Batman and go, if you want to understand Batman, here's the Dark Knight Returns or
01:09:31 here's the killing joke or here's year one or RIP or whatever happened at the Cape Crusader
01:09:37 or if you want to understand Spider-Man, there's Craven's Last Hunt or the death of the Stacey's
01:09:42 or, you know, all these characters as iconic as they are are only iconic because of the
01:09:48 strength of their stories.
01:09:49 They've all had those definitive runs.
01:09:52 Ven is never had one before now and this story feels like a definitive run for the character.
01:10:00 It starts out, the vision has created a family for himself.
01:10:05 Hank Pym created Ultron, Ultron created the vision and now the vision is creating a wife
01:10:12 and kids in his own image.
01:10:14 He creates a beautiful vision wife for himself named Virginia.
01:10:19 He creates a beautiful vision son, Vin.
01:10:22 He creates a beautiful vision teenage daughter, Viv.
01:10:25 So the vision has created a family for himself in his quest to become more human and live
01:10:32 as a human and understand what it is to live on this planet like the rest of us.
01:10:38 So he creates his cool, synthesoid family and he moves into a house in the suburbs and the
01:10:44 first issues are just, you know, him and his family, you know, this family of robot people
01:10:49 hanging out in the suburbs, getting into their neighbors and stuff.
01:10:52 So the vision is trying to live with this family in the suburbs and trying to be like
01:10:57 a regular person and of course it doesn't take long for all of it to go tragically awry.
01:11:05 An old supervillain of the Avengers called Grim Reaper attacks the house when vision
01:11:10 is away and so in self-defense his wife Virginia kills the Grim Reaper.
01:11:16 She murders him.
01:11:17 He's dead and she doesn't know what to do.
01:11:19 She's worried that there'll be repercussions or she won't be tried fairly because she's
01:11:23 a synthesoid or whatever.
01:11:25 So she hides the body and she's trying to keep the secret and unbeknownst to her, you
01:11:29 know, a neighbor saw her do it and filmed her doing it.
01:11:32 So now she's got to confront him and she's got and so anyways long story short, all kinds
01:11:37 of shit goes wrong.
01:11:38 Just to confront him, another, the neighbor dies, the neighbor's son dies.
01:11:43 Just every worst possible way that this wonderful little life the vision is trying to carve
01:11:49 out for himself could horribly fall apart in the span of like a couple months.
01:11:54 You know, this one unfortunate act of Virginia in self-defense killing the Grim Reaper spirals
01:12:01 out of control and next thing you know there's a dead kid and a dead neighbor and it's like
01:12:05 what the fuck is going on and like the Avengers become suspicious of him.
01:12:10 So they send this guy, Victor Mancha, who is sort of like another like vision, synthesoid
01:12:18 robot themed hero.
01:12:19 I think he's like also an Ultron creation.
01:12:22 So maybe he's like the vision's brother.
01:12:24 I don't really know much about that character, but he's like a guy with robot parts.
01:12:27 Anyways, they send him to spy on the vision and that goes wrong too.
01:12:33 So next thing you know, Victor, the Avengers spy who's sent to see what's going on at the
01:12:37 vision, he accidentally kills the vision's son.
01:12:41 So now we've got a fucking dead supervillain, we've got a dead neighbor, we've got a dead
01:12:45 kid and we've got a dead son.
01:12:48 The vision's beautiful, synthesoid son, Vin, is dead and now Vision is so pissed off.
01:12:55 He's on a rampage.
01:12:57 He's going to fucking, you know, he's going to beat up the Avengers, he's going to find
01:13:01 Victor Mancha and his little cell and kill him.
01:13:04 He's going to commit a murder because he's grieving and he's angry.
01:13:07 The, you know, it says right there, right in the background of this panel cast, even
01:13:13 an android can cry right in the upper right corner.
01:13:17 Nobody knows the grief and rage of an android and his dog.
01:13:23 So the vision is just kicking everyone's ass.
01:13:26 He beats up all the Avengers at once and he goes to kill this guy in the fucking cell
01:13:32 to seek vengeance for the death of his son and that's where issue 12 begins.
01:13:38 With the question of will the vision commit this vengeful murder from which there can
01:13:45 be no going back.
01:13:47 And you know what?
01:13:49 I'm not even going to spoil it because you got to read it for yourself.
01:13:53 You need to read it for yourself.
01:13:56 You need to understand.
01:13:58 You need to witness this story and all its glory.
01:14:01 It's so good.
01:14:02 There's so much pathos.
01:14:03 It's so fucking well written.
01:14:05 It makes you feel for this character in a way that you never would have thought before
01:14:11 that you could feel for the vision.
01:14:13 It makes you, it really fucking grabs you and you're like, yes, I understand now vision.
01:14:18 How could I have been so blind to not see how great the vision is?
01:14:23 This is a story that asks the big questions, folks.
01:14:26 What is it that really connects us?
01:14:28 What is it that truly makes us human?
01:14:31 What does it mean to be human really?
01:14:35 And it really drives home the point that the vision is more human than he realized for
01:14:42 better or for worse.
01:14:46 And that's all I'll say about it.
01:14:47 Ain't going to spoil this one.
01:14:50 You should all read it.
01:14:51 It's your duty to read it.
01:14:52 It's your sworn duty, all of you.
01:14:54 I'm giving you a fucking homework assignment.
01:14:57 Everyone has to read the vision.
01:14:59 All 12 issues.
01:15:00 It's the best fucking comic.
01:15:02 It's the best story that I've seen come out in comics in quite a fucking while, a good
01:15:08 number of years at least.
01:15:10 I can definitely say that for sure.
01:15:13 And it's written so well.
01:15:14 Like the fucking, the narration and the dialogue is so rich and heavy.
01:15:23 It's not written like a comic book.
01:15:25 It's written like literature.
01:15:27 It really takes itself seriously and it handles the telling of this story with all the gravitas
01:15:34 that it needs to.
01:15:35 And it's really effective.
01:15:37 It feels like a hugely important story.
01:15:41 It's so non-comicbook-y.
01:15:43 It doesn't feel like the other Marvel comic books.
01:15:47 It doesn't feel like a typical superhero bullshit.
01:15:51 It's not bogged down by the stupid event comic.
01:15:54 It has nothing to do with Civil War II or any of that bullshit, you know, that corporately
01:16:00 mandated cross-company horseshit that infects every fucking comic with these retarded continuity
01:16:07 politics.
01:16:08 It's self-contained.
01:16:10 It's not out of continuity.
01:16:12 But it's also not bogged down by the current stuff that's going on.
01:16:16 But it definitely is nothing like any of the other superhero comics that you're going
01:16:21 to read right now.
01:16:23 It's not a fucking story about, oh there's a bad guy and we're going to go fight him
01:16:28 and punch him in the nose and that's how we'll defeat the bad guy.
01:16:33 It's a totally different kind of story.
01:16:35 It's just like this character-driven, suspenseful thriller.
01:16:41 And it's so down to earth and human for a story about a fucking Synthesoid with a robot
01:16:48 dick.
01:16:49 Oh god, it's so good.
01:16:51 Oh, it's the best thing I've ever read in my fucking life.
01:16:54 Oh god.
01:16:56 I think laying on this couch is messing my head up.
01:16:58 I need to get back to the fucking computer.
01:17:01 Ah, shit.
01:17:03 Oh fuck.
01:17:07 Anyways, I hope that I've sufficiently sold you all on that without spoiling the last
01:17:14 issue.
01:17:15 You know, it's a 10 out of 10 baby, it's the kind of thing you read it and once you're
01:17:20 done reading it you're like, yeah, that's why I like comics right there baby.
01:17:23 That's what it's all about.
01:17:26 You know, you take a character like the Vision who is like this weird sea-list Avenger in
01:17:32 a lot of people's eyes.
01:17:33 You know, this unrelatable sort of robot guy who's always just there as part of the team
01:17:40 but nobody really cares about him.
01:17:42 You take a character like that and you take your time telling a story about him that like
01:17:48 delves into what really makes him tick and sort of touches on these very human things
01:17:55 that everyone can relate to.
01:17:58 You know, stuff like family and loss and grief and rage and you take this character that
01:18:03 nobody suspected could have this kind of pathos and you imbue it, you imbue this captivating
01:18:11 complex characterization into this character that maybe he had all along it just took the
01:18:17 right writer to show us what a great character the Vision could truly be.
01:18:24 Vision number 12 people, comic of the week.
01:18:27 Everybody go out and find Vision number one, go to the fucking comic readers, I'll link
01:18:30 them in the description box.
01:18:32 Star with Vision number one, read the whole damn series.
01:18:35 That's your fucking homework for this week.
01:18:38 Everybody go enrich your lives with this piece of fucking literature that ought to be studied
01:18:44 in schools for the rest of time.
01:18:47 This modern masterpiece.
01:18:50 Okay, so, I've talked about a lot of comics this week, some good, some bad, some fantastic,
01:18:59 but there's one more comic that I wanted to talk about this week, one more comic that
01:19:06 came out that I think is worth a mention and that comic is...
01:19:16 Your fucking wolf cop number one, baby, I told you on the motherfucking wolf man, baby.
01:19:25 Everybody forgot about the wolf man, but the wolf man is here to stay, yeah, let me tell
01:19:38 you people about the wolf cop.
01:19:41 If you've been following the Ramelama Ding Dong on my Patreon feed, then you've probably
01:19:46 seen the wolf man talking about the wolf cop.
01:19:50 You've seen me praising the movie, you've seen me doing a review of the movie on my
01:19:54 Patreon and what a fantastical little piece of happenstance right here, that the week
01:20:00 I happen to see the wolf cop movie, there just happens to be a wolf cop comic coming
01:20:06 out to continue to franchise on this very eve.
01:20:10 That's what I call serendipity, baby, that's what I call a Ramelama Ding Dong.
01:20:16 Now in case you don't know, in case you ain't seen the movie, in case you ain't seen the
01:20:20 light yet, in case you ain't one of the chosen few enlightened individuals who know the saga
01:20:27 of the wolf cop, in case you do not know, I will inform you.
01:20:31 The wolf cop is the wolf man alter ego of Officer Lou Garoo.
01:20:36 He is a small town cop in a spooky town, he gotta fight shapeshifting witches and warlocks
01:20:42 all day every day, but luckily he happens to have the power of the wolf man on his side
01:20:48 and when that full moon rises high into the sky, you know it's about to get hairy up in
01:20:53 here, awoo!
01:20:55 The man turns into the wolf man and the wolf man turns, I said the wolf man turns into
01:21:01 the wolf cop daddy.
01:21:03 The wolf cop he kills people, he cuts their faces off with claws, he rips them into shreds,
01:21:09 he rips the entrails on, he feasts on the corpses, he takes his police cruiser and it
01:21:14 modifies it into a bad ass spooky wolf cop mobile.
01:21:18 And he goes out into the city and he solves crimes and he brutally viciously murders
01:21:23 criminals left and right, and he drinks like a fish, and he smokes cigarettes, and he fucks
01:21:30 beautiful women.
01:21:31 The wolf cop is a Trump supporter, he grabs the girl is by the pussy, cuz he's the motherfucking
01:21:38 wolf cop, and the wolf cop don't take no for an answer daddy, oh no, woo!
01:21:44 The wolf cop is a rapist, aw hell yeah, ah!
01:21:50 So wolf cop the comic issue number one, it opens up presumably after the movie, wolf cop
01:21:56 is driving around the road in his police cruiser wolf cop mobile with his best buddy.
01:22:02 Now right off the bat this part confused me a little bit because I gotta spoil the movie
01:22:07 for you right here, I gotta give a little spoiler right here, and I'm giving you a fair warning
01:22:12 because wolf cop is a masterpiece of film that everybody should see ten times and commit
01:22:18 to memory.
01:22:19 Every single frame of that masterpiece should be burned in your memory for all time baby,
01:22:25 but in case you haven't seen it I'm warning you right now, I gotta spoil the end of the
01:22:28 movie just a little bit to tell you what confused me about issue one of this comic, okay, so
01:22:33 at the end of the movie it is revealed that wolf cop's best buddy is actually a shape
01:22:41 shifting lizard man, and he was one of the bad guys, and wolf cop had to kill him.
01:22:46 That was a twist in the movie, a movie takes twists and turns that you don't always know
01:22:50 about going into it baby.
01:22:52 But I gotta admit if there was one flaw with the wolf cop feature film it was that I was
01:22:57 a little disappointed that his buddy turned out to be a lizard man who had to be killed
01:23:03 because the buddy and the wolf cop they had a wonderful chemistry together that really
01:23:07 made the film something special, their scenes together were funny and charming and wonderful
01:23:13 to watch.
01:23:14 So I was a little bit disappointed that it turned out to be a bad guy in the end, but
01:23:19 anyways wolf cop the comic issue number one it opens up and wolf cop is driving around
01:23:24 in his wolf cop mobile and there's his man right there.
01:23:28 So I gotta wonder man cause this don't make no sense something here don't add up.
01:23:33 How can he be there, how can there still be buddies, how can he still be alive when he
01:23:38 was a lizard man at the end of the movie wolf cop had to kill him last time.
01:23:42 They did not explain how he is somehow back from the dead and somehow they are unspeaking
01:23:47 terms again.
01:23:49 Don't get me wrong I am glad that he is back from the dead and they are buddies again.
01:23:54 It warms my heart to see because they have a good chemistry.
01:23:58 They got a buddy chemistry.
01:24:00 I like a buddy movie.
01:24:01 I like a road trip buddy movie.
01:24:04 I like a road trip buddy wolf cop movie.
01:24:07 I am not complaining but I do hope that at some point over the course of this comic book
01:24:13 series they do explain how this boy came back from the dead and why wolf cop in his
01:24:20 infinite wisdom chose to forgive him for his vile betrayal.
01:24:24 The wolf man is turning into the Babadook spook a little bit.
01:24:29 Sometimes the characters bleed into the other characters and I turn into Captain Barbosa
01:24:35 now.
01:24:36 All the characters they all start from the same voice and they branch out Miss Turner
01:24:41 and sometimes it gets a little confusing.
01:24:45 You best start believing in stupid podcasts Miss Turner.
01:24:50 You're in one.
01:24:51 But anyways back to the wolf man baby.
01:24:54 Now this is just issue one so I can forgive him for a lack of exposition.
01:25:00 Clearly they wanted to get right into the nitty gritty and right into the meat of the story
01:25:04 with an action packed first issue.
01:25:06 No time to sit around a diner table and talk about what led to these events.
01:25:11 I understand that but I do hope at some point they explain this glaring plot hole baby.
01:25:18 I'm the fucking wolf man.
01:25:21 Anyways the issue starts and he with his buddy going on a road trip into wolf cop cruiser
01:25:27 and he going down a road and suddenly a gang of bikers they come up and they're looking
01:25:32 for a scramble.
01:25:33 They're looking for a tussle.
01:25:34 They're looking for a rumble.
01:25:36 They're looking for a fight.
01:25:38 But of course they picked the wrong time daddy because once that moon gets up in the sky
01:25:43 you turn into a motherfucking wolf man.
01:25:47 And that wolf man ain't just a wolf man.
01:25:49 I've been telling you this whole time he is a wolf cop daddy.
01:25:54 He got a gun, he got a police car, he got boots and a shirt, he got a badge, he got
01:26:03 a bad attitude and he got a lot, a lot of whiskey to drink, he gonna drink all the booze
01:26:10 you got and he gonna do it with all the ladies too.
01:26:13 He drinking beer and his smoking cigarettes.
01:26:16 Do he like to party?
01:26:18 The answer is a yes.
01:26:20 Now I'm the crazy taxi guy.
01:26:23 It's time to pick a car and driver.
01:26:27 Wolf cop are you ready?
01:26:29 Here we go.
01:26:31 It's time to check out how you did the day.
01:26:33 Now let's take a look at class D lessons.
01:26:37 I can't believe it.
01:26:38 Is that your best come back and try again?
01:26:41 But anyway let me tell you what I was telling you before I was interrupted by the crazy
01:26:45 taxi man.
01:26:46 I was trying to tell you about the adventures of wolf cop baby.
01:26:50 Wolf cop he come and he fights him and then he takes those bikers back to where they came
01:26:55 from and it turns out they're working for a scary cannibal man and the cannibal man is
01:27:00 eating people so wolf cop got to fight the cannibal man now but it turns out he ain't
01:27:05 just no normal man he got a secret of his own.
01:27:09 The cannibal man turn into a giant were pig.
01:27:13 I said a were pig man and let me tell you this were pig is even bigger and scarier than
01:27:20 the wolf cop.
01:27:21 How can wolf cop defeat an enemy as big and vicious and large and in charge as the cannibal
01:27:29 were pig.
01:27:30 Quite easily it turns out wolf cop kicks the crap out of the were pig it kills him dead
01:27:37 real easy it only takes like one or two pages man.
01:27:41 So then after wolf cop killed a were pig that unsaved all the damsels in distress they open
01:27:47 the door and they save all the pretty girls and they run off to be somewhere better and
01:27:52 wolf cop he's a little bit banged up but he gonna be okay ain't nobody tougher or
01:27:57 meaner than the wolf cop and his buddy come up and he say we did it now let's get the
01:28:02 fuck out of here what we gonna do now wolf cop and wolf cop says drink and the buddy
01:28:08 give him a thumbs up he said god damn right buddy and that's the end of issue number one
01:28:16 of the motherfucking wolf cop and I am the wolf man daddy
01:28:22 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
