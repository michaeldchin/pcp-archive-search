00:00:00 Okay, I'm gonna zoom the fuck out and it's gonna start like this.
00:00:03 Okay.
00:00:30 It's quite a place.
00:00:44 You are a part of a social media experiment right now.
00:00:48 We have come up with the hit new trend.
00:00:51 Viral marketing.
00:00:53 Check out this shit.
00:00:55 Advertisements.
00:00:56 Online.
00:00:58 You're watching one right now.
00:01:00 You got some shit.
00:01:01 You got some shit on your face.
00:01:03 That's just called passion for internet viral marketing.
00:01:07 What you call shit, I call fire.
00:01:10 I call charisma.
00:01:12 I call dollar signs in my eyes when I see advertisements.
00:01:17 Marketing.
00:01:18 Branding.
00:01:20 Merchandise.
00:01:21 Merchandise.
00:01:22 You're hired.
00:01:23 You're hired.
00:01:24 Yes, yes.
00:01:25 I'm in the ground floor, baby.
00:01:27 Welcome to the procrastinator's podcast, episode 142.
00:01:31 Yes.
00:01:32 We're the reason people are dying.
00:01:34 There's a special live episode from Radcon 3.33.
00:01:37 There are no lectures.
00:01:39 Please stop asking.
00:01:41 You cannot.
00:01:43 Everyone's leaving.
00:01:45 Everyone's leaving tomorrow.
00:01:46 We can't do it.
00:01:47 We can't.
00:01:48 We can't fucking pee brains.
00:01:49 Can't fucking handle it.
00:01:50 Maybe we should just tell people in general why we're here together.
00:01:53 That'd be pretty cool.
00:01:54 Why are we here together?
00:01:55 First of all.
00:01:56 My name's not Nate.
00:01:57 I'm the Jester King.
00:01:59 Refer to me by my full legal.
00:02:01 I am Nate.
00:02:02 Welcome to the procrastinator's podcast.
00:02:05 So the reason we all got together here was because we've just been talking for a long time about our various future plans.
00:02:13 And people were asking us about stuff.
00:02:15 So we got together here.
00:02:17 We're at Digi's place outside of Boston.
00:02:20 And we thought we would just...
00:02:21 Give me a dress.
00:02:22 Give me a dress.
00:02:23 Give me a dress.
00:02:24 You can see nary a tumbleweed.
00:02:26 Ignore another man.
00:02:28 We just thought we'd get together and hash out as best we could some future plans for future shows.
00:02:35 Not necessarily exactly PCP related.
00:02:38 And I don't know.
00:02:39 I guess we won't get into it too much.
00:02:40 I think there's something that may have just rendered this entire meetup moot.
00:02:46 As you see.
00:02:47 It's just my attention.
00:02:48 You know, I'm on the ground floor.
00:02:50 You know, I'm up in forums.
00:02:51 I'm in message boards.
00:02:52 I get...
00:02:53 I'm in IRC chats.
00:02:54 I get updates on the web daily, bro.
00:02:57 I am online as the so-called online.
00:03:00 And I found some crazy technology.
00:03:03 Apparently, there's an app that will allow you to talk to people from far away.
00:03:08 So if you are at different locations, you can talk to one another with your voice and possibly even have a meeting of some sort to exchange ideas to little to no cost.
00:03:19 Wow.
00:03:20 If only we'd known this existed, we could have just not done this entire trip.
00:03:23 Yeah.
00:03:24 That would have made this whole thing a complete waste of time and money.
00:03:27 What do you know?
00:03:28 Fuck yeah, dude!
00:03:29 Fuck yeah!
00:03:30 Woo!
00:03:31 Uh, well, I'm just glad to see you guys, no matter what.
00:03:35 That makes me one of us.
00:03:37 This has ballooned out from I came out here for fun, for pleasure, for raw, un-untamed pleasure.
00:03:45 And then I think you were the first one's dog pile.
00:03:48 I mean, I just said, well, let's have a meeting.
00:03:50 Let's all meet up and talk about stuff.
00:03:52 Uh, and yeah.
00:03:53 I mean, I figured part of it was because Nate had not come home for the holidays.
00:03:58 That was an element, yes.
00:03:59 He was missing the old fam, up here in Boston.
00:04:01 That's true.
00:04:02 That's fair.
00:04:03 So yeah, he came to see his mama and papa.
00:04:06 Yep, briefly.
00:04:07 And then came over here to Jack Dick for two days about where the fuck are we gonna try to set up a PCPHQ!
00:04:15 As the meme has been going for fucking five years.
00:04:20 Would you say it's fair to say that PCPHQ is not what we discussed?
00:04:26 I mean, depending on how you look at it.
00:04:28 It's who's living where.
00:04:31 Conceptually, what PCPHQ has only ever meant to me is more than one guy lives in the same place and does a show together.
00:04:39 So PCPHQ is already here right now.
00:04:43 Yeah, this could be seen as a PCPHQ because we're doing the PCP in a headquarters together.
00:04:51 It is a PCPHQ, but not the PCPHQ.
00:04:53 It's a temporary PCPHQ.
00:04:55 PCPHQ is really more of a state of mind.
00:04:57 The real PCPHQ was the friends we made along the way.
00:04:59 We're having wars with various cities so they can pledge and they can offer lower tax cuts for their PCPHQ.
00:05:06 I'm thinking it's like when you're fighting a battle and they set up a temporary headquarters on the front lines.
00:05:12 That sort of HQ.
00:05:14 I've always envisioned PCPHQ would come into being basically when we moved up to the next level of content creation.
00:05:21 It was like a soft green light for it to be actual PCPHQ, which in my mind always involved a studio or could be in somebody's house.
00:05:31 I think the second that there is a permanent fixed setup for multiple members of the PCP to do a show together.
00:05:38 That is what the thing has been.
00:05:42 What do you call it? Doesn't matter.
00:05:44 But that is the thing that we've been building towards is get enough of us in one place with a permanent setup doing a fixed show that is not an audio part.
00:05:53 The biggest obstacle is the goal.
00:05:55 That sounds like the goal.
00:05:56 Anyways, how's IM Games doing?
00:05:58 IM Games is doing okay.
00:06:00 That's exactly what you're just describing.
00:06:02 Two people in the same permanent place doing a show that isn't an audio part.
00:06:06 You could say that that is a PCPHQ project.
00:06:12 I guess so.
00:06:13 It makes sense.
00:06:14 Are we going to get into all these things or are we just cock teasing people who actually can?
00:06:18 Cock teasing is just funny.
00:06:20 We don't want to say anything too.
00:06:22 We did not come away with this having a decided plan.
00:06:26 We don't have a concrete plan here.
00:06:28 I don't want to hype up our fans.
00:06:30 I'll tell people this.
00:06:31 On the idea of what we would go on, we generally are all on the same page.
00:06:36 We have general technicalities.
00:06:38 Mostly we understand where the others lie and we have something going there.
00:06:43 The biggest thing we're still working on has always been by far.
00:06:47 The biggest obstacle is actually getting the human bodies in the location and figuring out what the best place is to do that.
00:06:54 It's always been true that the best way for that to happen is to make more money.
00:06:58 We've continually made more money so it's become more possible.
00:07:01 That's absolutely true.
00:07:03 But we still haven't made enough money for it to be easy.
00:07:07 True.
00:07:08 I think that our vision was that we would just have this constant up the escalator of how much we're making.
00:07:14 Then we'd reach some certain cross some threshold where it becomes like,
00:07:18 oh, we can fly all my fucking dudes out to the same neighborhood.
00:07:21 It's not at that level yet.
00:07:23 Well, it's always been, I don't know.
00:07:26 It has worked out that it seems like some of us have to individually find success to even be in a position to attempt to do that.
00:07:35 Which is more or less what's happened.
00:07:37 I love talking in vagaries at length.
00:07:40 There's nothing more to say.
00:07:42 We can tell them some of the places we're looking at, but what's the fucking point?
00:07:45 We can at least say that if you and I get a place in the same neighborhood,
00:07:50 we guaranteed we'll make a Red Letter Media rip-off show.
00:07:54 That's true.
00:07:55 If you want to see us rip off Red Letter Media,
00:07:58 aka the plebe and the weave except it's me and Nate,
00:08:01 then just give us a couple extra dollars so we can expedite the process.
00:08:07 Do what you can.
00:08:08 Do what you feel comfortable with.
00:08:09 If that sounds like gay shit, then kill yourself.
00:08:15 Hey, do you want to inspire a new spin?
00:08:18 Shit.
00:08:19 Oh, you left it at home?
00:08:20 I tied it.
00:08:21 I tied it already.
00:08:22 Yeah, but it's all downstairs and there's girls downstairs.
00:08:26 I can't fucking kill myself with girls around.
00:08:28 You know, you shit yourself when you die?
00:08:30 You're so embarrassing.
00:08:35 Well, what else is going on in the old heads of our men?
00:08:40 There's so much startups.
00:08:43 There's so many startups that I've been starting recently.
00:08:46 The Kickstarter's are just through the fucking roof.
00:08:50 Not like I've gotten a lot from them, but there are just a lot of them.
00:08:53 I've got a Kickstarter.
00:08:54 I've got an Indiegogo.
00:08:55 I've got a GoFundMe.
00:08:56 I've got a Patreon.
00:08:57 I've got a LinkedIn.
00:08:58 I've got a Subbable.
00:08:59 I've got a LinkedIn doesn't pay you any money.
00:09:01 But it could.
00:09:02 It's not a crowdfunding platform.
00:09:03 Obviously, you're not using the platform the way that I am.
00:09:06 I've got a Teespring.
00:09:07 I've got a can that I put in front of me out of the fucking subway.
00:09:12 I've got a Teespring, a spreadsheet.
00:09:13 I've got a Pinterest.
00:09:15 I've got an Etsy.
00:09:16 Fuck yeah.
00:09:17 A print all over me.
00:09:19 That's the premium shit.
00:09:21 Think that about it.
00:09:24 I can't think of any cool, fucking sick anecdotes.
00:09:28 Like, oh man, the other day, just saw a homeless guy do so cool.
00:09:32 Because for the past three to nine years of my entire life, it feels like now.
00:09:40 We've just been stewing and fucking stewing about hardcore business real life bullshit.
00:09:46 And frankly, it's melted my mind to a complete mush.
00:09:50 And I don't have anything to say about anything.
00:09:52 We spent like 90 years yesterday, like fucking at the park playing Pokemon Go to the Pole.
00:09:58 Yeah!
00:09:59 It was fucking sick!
00:10:00 Yeah!
00:10:01 Woo!
00:10:02 Oh, dude.
00:10:03 Oh, fucking dude.
00:10:04 I'm air high five with all those.
00:10:05 I'm so mad.
00:10:06 Because we were doing a raid.
00:10:07 And I was going to get someone to train me.
00:10:10 They're fucking Pokemon.
00:10:11 And they didn't.
00:10:12 What a bitch.
00:10:13 I was going to catch a heatran yesterday.
00:10:16 I did catch a shiny totodile.
00:10:18 So that was cool.
00:10:19 Four.
00:10:20 Fucking Pokemon Go.
00:10:21 Four shiny totodiles.
00:10:22 Got away.
00:10:23 Miss the heatran.
00:10:24 And that sucks.
00:10:25 Everyone's like, oh, Pokemon Go is so interesting.
00:10:27 Guys, please talk about capitalism.
00:10:29 We want you to talk more about your weird political bullshit.
00:10:33 We listen to it every episode.
00:10:36 And it's never enough.
00:10:37 Every episode is political garbage.
00:10:39 But it's never enough to satiate us.
00:10:41 So please go arm to arm.
00:10:44 Because the last time it came up, I mean, I know that's like you're joking kind of.
00:10:49 No.
00:10:50 But people wanted to know the end of the conversation that was happening with capitalism stuff.
00:10:56 I was like to fucking fight about it.
00:10:58 It was getting really heated.
00:10:59 But we were all so tired from that episode.
00:11:02 Which episode was this?
00:11:04 The one that just, the last one.
00:11:05 I did have one point I wanted to make that I kind of regretted not shoving in there.
00:11:09 Which was simply this.
00:11:11 Well, I do literally believe taxation is theft.
00:11:16 I still think that some injustice is warranted for the sake of the greater good.
00:11:22 Which is effectively leftist politics.
00:11:24 Which is, that's the point.
00:11:26 So do I think that all taxes make no sense and should be stopped immediately?
00:11:30 No.
00:11:31 Because like, you know, a doctor has to fucking cut you open and hurt you a little bit to fix the disease inside.
00:11:36 Similar sort of fucking thing, in my opinion.
00:11:38 How fair would you say the comparison from taxes to rent is?
00:11:44 Pretty similar.
00:11:45 Yes.
00:11:46 Yeah, relatively similar.
00:11:47 With rent, you have the option to leave.
00:11:50 If you live in a nation, you don't really have the option to leave.
00:11:53 Where are you going to do?
00:11:54 Not live anywhere?
00:11:55 Not pay any rent?
00:11:56 Well, I mean, if you say like rent in general, I mean, I suppose that's fair.
00:12:00 Well, no.
00:12:01 Because like, you can't really choose to find somewhere else.
00:12:04 You can live without a house over your head.
00:12:07 You can live.
00:12:08 I mean, you can survive.
00:12:09 You're homeless people all over the place.
00:12:11 I mean, it depends on the kind of life that you want.
00:12:13 Here in America, you got three unalienable rights.
00:12:16 Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.
00:12:18 Don't need a house for any of those.
00:12:20 Well, I mean, it just depends on the kind of life.
00:12:22 Like, if you want to be, for example, a online content creator, you're going to need internet.
00:12:26 Yeah.
00:12:27 Well, you have the ability to pursue that happiness.
00:12:30 Yes, you will have to pay rent, but that is because you made the decision that you wanted
00:12:34 to be something other than homeless.
00:12:36 That falls on you.
00:12:37 There's no one else's responsibility over there.
00:12:39 Sure.
00:12:40 Whereas taxes is like, like you said, you can't leave.
00:12:43 Yeah.
00:12:44 You have no option.
00:12:45 You just have to pay it because you made income in the country.
00:12:48 You know?
00:12:49 They actually could move somewhere else with lower taxes.
00:12:53 That is theoretically possible, but it's just much harder.
00:12:56 I mean, even like leaving, like you'd have to leave America and find a country that had
00:13:03 no taxes.
00:13:04 And that's really difficult.
00:13:06 Which probably I haven't looked, but probably doesn't exist.
00:13:09 But you're going to, I mean, you can't really find a house that doesn't ask you to pay anything.
00:13:13 Right?
00:13:14 Yeah, there are some places like that.
00:13:16 That are literally free to walk in.
00:13:18 I mean, like, you know, if somebody's just like some weird benefactor situation, I mean,
00:13:23 Ben lived in a place for a little while that like someone had just.
00:13:26 There was, we were, we were suing, they were suing the landlord because the landlord was
00:13:30 trying to evict them without notice or cause.
00:13:32 So there was a six months period where the fucking legal shit was going down where no
00:13:37 one was paying any rent to live there.
00:13:39 Magical.
00:13:40 We've really hit the ground running.
00:13:42 Haha.
00:13:43 Welcome to the PCP.
00:13:44 Yeah.
00:13:45 Yeah.
00:13:46 Yeah.
00:13:47 All right.
00:13:48 Everyone's going wild over this banana pizza.
00:13:50 It's fucking crazy, dog.
00:13:52 Shut the fuck up, Skeeter.
00:13:54 I'm with Patty.
00:13:56 She's getting all sad and glossy-eyed.
00:13:58 Sure.
00:13:59 May have put a little bit of stuff in her drink, I'm saying.
00:14:02 But hey, listen.
00:14:03 Patty, she's mine.
00:14:05 Back off, Skeeter.
00:14:06 Patty, listen.
00:14:07 You can't, you have to eat.
00:14:08 You didn't eat all day before the big track meet.
00:14:11 Your body needs food.
00:14:12 Patty!
00:14:13 Or eat some of this banana pudding pizza.
00:14:15 Patty!
00:14:16 You're gonna fucking die.
00:14:17 Patty, it's the next big thing.
00:14:18 You're not gonna believe it.
00:14:19 Buy gold, Patty.
00:14:20 The fucking cops are coming.
00:14:21 You don't want to be caught off guard.
00:14:22 We'll buy the bottom drop.
00:14:23 You're gonna need two things.
00:14:24 You're gonna need water and gold.
00:14:25 You're gonna need banana pudding pizza.
00:14:26 That's gonna be the currency in the future.
00:14:27 No one's gonna want to eat anything else once this hits.
00:14:28 Hey, hey guys.
00:14:29 Yeah?
00:14:30 Let's do the intro again.
00:14:31 Let's restart.
00:14:32 You guys, you brought this up specifically.
00:14:33 It was you who made it.
00:14:34 Everyone's prepared for a big fight.
00:14:35 But I don't think anyone here among us is like ready or willing or wants to fight about
00:14:41 something that obviously nothing.
00:14:44 No, you weren't.
00:14:45 No, you weren't.
00:14:46 You weren't.
00:14:47 You weren't.
00:14:48 You weren't.
00:14:49 You weren't.
00:14:50 You weren't.
00:14:51 You weren't.
00:14:52 You weren't.
00:14:53 You weren't.
00:14:54 You weren't.
00:14:55 You weren't.
00:14:56 You weren't.
00:14:57 You weren't.
00:14:58 You weren't.
00:14:59 You weren't.
00:15:00 You weren't.
00:15:01 You weren't.
00:15:02 And 300 or something like that obviously nothing.
00:15:03 You were, no no you were right.
00:15:04 Yeah.
00:15:05 You were right.
00:15:06 It's terrible.
00:15:07 Yeah.
00:15:08 I was mistaken.
00:15:09 Ah, okay, good.
00:15:10 Fantastic.
00:15:11 Oh.
00:15:12 Did you have been doing this thing all night where he just silent write something down
00:15:14 and then shows us to us?
00:15:15 Uh, I...
00:15:16 I don't know what the like expected response is, just like, haha, fuck, yeah, did she sick?
00:15:20 I mean, have you seen the world famous probably up to a million 10 million views by now.
00:15:24 Video, noogle, on this very channel, uh, uh, inspired by just didgy writing on this board.
00:15:30 So clearly the dividends are paying off in triplicate, if more.
00:15:35 Yeah, we've made a lot of money off of Google and Tugel.
00:15:38 We're going to be launching 3Gal next year.
00:15:40 That'll be after Tugel inevitably fails.
00:15:42 Oh, you have a little bit of a pity.
00:15:44 And then the subsidiary of 3Gal Seagal,
00:15:46 you kicked me out of the Tugel share.
00:15:49 I was 50-50 with you.
00:15:51 And now you're starting 3Gal without me?
00:15:53 Well, I got other friends who need to pay their bills, too.
00:15:58 This is never mine.
00:15:59 I fell down.
00:16:02 Just like my love life.
00:16:04 The invisible hand of the free market
00:16:06 just gave you the middle finger.
00:16:07 Just scooched you right off the edge of the Grand Canyon,
00:16:10 right into the slime scene.
00:16:12 Digi, you know that thing that you always say?
00:16:17 It's like a catchphrase.
00:16:18 It's like holy shit, but for the new age.
00:16:24 I don't know what anyone else is doing.
00:16:26 No one knows what anyone else is doing.
00:16:28 That catchphrase you said to us last time?
00:16:31 What the hell are you talking about?
00:16:32 I don't remember that.
00:16:33 Anyway.
00:16:34 It says the invisible hand of the free market.
00:16:36 It's invisible.
00:16:37 Nice one.
00:16:37 I'm showing it to the camera.
00:16:39 I can't see it on the screen.
00:16:41 It makes it extra bold.
00:16:42 It was in relation to how everyone,
00:16:45 knowing the PCP talks about their working shit,
00:16:47 you don't know what anyone else is working on.
00:16:49 I don't know what anyone else is working on,
00:16:50 besides in vague, vagaluridies, right?
00:16:54 I feel like I know what everybody's working on.
00:16:56 OK, well, cool.
00:16:57 I think.
00:16:58 Cookies are done.
00:16:59 Who the fuck is making cookies?
00:17:00 I heard a ding.
00:17:01 It sounded like cookies are done.
00:17:02 Let's talk about what we're working on.
00:17:03 That's interesting, I think.
00:17:05 Yeah, I mean.
00:17:06 All right.
00:17:06 What are you working on, Hippo Crit?
00:17:09 What am I working on?
00:17:10 Hippo's got the most interesting shit going on.
00:17:13 Yeah, he does.
00:17:14 He doesn't want to talk about it.
00:17:15 He never speaks to it.
00:17:16 That speaks to that.
00:17:17 Well, I'll speak about it in private.
00:17:19 But I'm writing scripts, screenplay.
00:17:24 This competition has to happen a thousand times forever.
00:17:26 Where we're just like, Hippo, tell us about what you do.
00:17:28 And you say, well, I'm writing a script.
00:17:30 And we're like, holy shit.
00:17:31 Yeah.
00:17:33 It's great.
00:17:34 And then the episode goes by.
00:17:35 And we're like, Hippo, what the fuck are you doing?
00:17:37 I don't get it still.
00:17:39 Still writing the screenplay.
00:17:41 Oh my god.
00:17:42 Wow.
00:17:43 I'm writing dialogue.
00:17:44 I'm doing stuff to make a potentially feature
00:17:50 film of 2D animation for families and young children.
00:17:57 I'm not a family, can I get it?
00:17:59 We have to clarify, this isn't an internet gay thing.
00:18:01 This is real life.
00:18:02 Yeah, this is a real thing.
00:18:03 This is like non-gay.
00:18:04 I'm freelance hired writer to do this.
00:18:08 Like the goal is for it to be on a network.
00:18:12 The goal is to be on a little bit more of a credible media
00:18:15 platform.
00:18:16 To be profitable enough so that it doesn't bankrupt anyone.
00:18:23 So that we make our money back and it'll be pretty good.
00:18:26 And people see it.
00:18:27 But mostly so that the people involved, me and the director
00:18:32 and the head of ART, the company I'm in at the moment,
00:18:35 it's just basically three people.
00:18:36 And I'm not really part of the company.
00:18:38 We're all just sort of freelance.
00:18:40 It's just like the director.
00:18:41 You get some equity, man.
00:18:42 The director, I'm the head writer.
00:18:44 And then there's like the ART guy.
00:18:46 And we're all working to put this.
00:18:49 I wish I was head writer on something.
00:18:51 Me too.
00:18:52 To put this.
00:18:53 Actually, I don't.
00:18:53 But I feel sorry for the opposition.
00:18:57 So that the company and each of us
00:18:59 could get a main recognition so that we can make more stuff.
00:19:02 Because that's how you do anything
00:19:05 is you are known by people.
00:19:07 So like we make it.
00:19:08 Exposure.
00:19:09 Yeah.
00:19:10 Yeah.
00:19:10 Exposure, there.
00:19:11 That's what I'm working on in the real world.
00:19:14 In the internet world, I'm doing a webcomic.
00:19:17 And it's pretty cool as well.
00:19:21 I don't really know what else.
00:19:22 I guess I quit YouTube, but I already talked about that.
00:19:25 I don't know if you want to get on the show,
00:19:27 because it's so early in the planning.
00:19:28 But we were talking about this the other day of our Oost
00:19:31 accord.
00:19:33 And we might be working together on something, maybe,
00:19:35 if it pans out.
00:19:36 Yeah.
00:19:37 I think it's so fucking cool.
00:19:39 Wait, can you feel ever so slightly less vague?
00:19:42 So I know what you're talking about.
00:19:43 Something with jailbait.
00:19:45 Oh, I don't think I heard about that.
00:19:46 You said jailbait?
00:19:48 No.
00:19:48 Something with jailbait.
00:19:49 Something with jailbait is involved.
00:19:52 That's what you write when it's like the NSFW,
00:19:54 like Undertale, but like an animal tail, like jailbait.
00:19:58 That's what you type in if you want the rule told you to hold it.
00:20:01 Obviously, you started out on YouTube in the internet as a whole.
00:20:04 What do you want your ideal balance
00:20:06 to be between those two worlds?
00:20:07 Because obviously, we all think that the real world stuff
00:20:09 is super fucking neat and cool.
00:20:11 But you love the internet as much as we want you to be on.
00:20:14 Well, it's not like I don't love the real world.
00:20:16 Sure.
00:20:18 Because I have no writing experience
00:20:20 beyond what I've done for this gig, this writing gig.
00:20:26 So I've learned a lot very quickly,
00:20:28 because you get exposed through people talking about things
00:20:32 and you read books that they recommend.
00:20:34 And then I know more than I did.
00:20:37 But it feels scary, because I didn't go to college for that.
00:20:40 I don't really know what I'm doing, but I'm figuring it out.
00:20:44 And once the fruits of my labor start becoming real things,
00:20:51 I can show people rather than just like,
00:20:54 yeah, a couple of years down the line,
00:20:56 or maybe the film will be in production.
00:20:58 Well, there's a video, right?
00:21:01 There's a trailer.
00:21:02 They can't, no.
00:21:03 The trailer's secret, and no one can see it.
00:21:06 Well, because it's not the final trailer.
00:21:07 But this is just an idea.
00:21:11 No, it's just fine.
00:21:13 They can know that there's a secret trailer,
00:21:15 because it's cool and mysterious, but they can't see it.
00:21:19 Link in the description.
00:21:19 Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
00:21:22 wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:21:23 So what do you want the balance to be?
00:21:24 Other balance?
00:21:25 Like what would you just want to do,
00:21:28 like have this be your job, because it's
00:21:31 fulfilling in a lot of ways to you.
00:21:33 and then come home and then make a comic page or to a day?
00:21:36 Um, all the balance, yeah, in terms of work, I want the writing to be, like, I don't want to
00:21:44 let it slip by, like, I don't want to be like, oh, there's this thing I could be doing, I could
00:21:50 be writing, but, you know, I'm more interested in this, like, stuff that is, like, less immediately
00:21:57 viable, like, if I'm tied to someone else's work who is also trying to make it real and work.
00:22:03 Then it's like, it's more likely that that's going to be a thing and that's going to make me
00:22:07 money and then that's going to further, like, make me money in the future. So it's, like,
00:22:11 a better investment of time. So I want to work hard on that right now.
00:22:16 Big industry, dude.
00:22:19 Are you waiting to say that?
00:22:23 True. It is a big industry.
00:22:25 Pipo's got that big industry energy.
00:22:27 And, like, fucking, um, the writing, I wanted to be, like, 70% or maybe 80%. Like, the stuff
00:22:39 that I was doing on YouTube, it always felt like a hobby, even though I was trying to make it a
00:22:43 real thing. It's just, like, I could never give a shit enough about it. The webcomic stuff is,
00:22:48 like, more fun and I enjoy that a lot more than the YouTube stuff, but it still feels like a hobby
00:22:53 because I'm, like, I'm still, I don't feel like I'm good enough at drawing to be, like, you know,
00:22:58 making people, like, turn heads or whatever. But, like, doing the writing stuff, I would be getting
00:23:04 better at writing in general, so, like, my comics will improve. So, like, maybe it'll be, like,
00:23:09 I don't know, it just depends on, like, who gives a shit about the, the, the, the hobby
00:23:14 comic stuff. Do you see yourself becoming a fully offline creator? Do you see yourself
00:23:20 becoming, like, like, a writer by trade and online and that stuff? Or, or is the goal always to
00:23:24 become an internet patron of man? The goal, I think, is just to be a hybrid. Okay. Yeah. Like, I don't,
00:23:31 I don't see, like, it used to be you're either an internet guy because you're young or a real guy
00:23:38 because you're older and the internet wasn't really around while you were growing up. But, like,
00:23:42 there's more people now that are in the industry from, like, doing internet stuff, like me. Like,
00:23:49 they made DVNR accounts and people hired them because, like, they liked their art.
00:23:54 Like a sugar and whatnot. Yeah. And, like, Lauren Faust as a DVNR, Faust as a DVNR as well.
00:24:01 It's like, um, internet and it's like, you can have both. I can be known as, like, the guy who
00:24:07 writes the thing or I can be probably more well known as the guy who writes that comic.
00:24:11 And I get money for both, probably. Yeah. As long, like, as long as your work's getting out there
00:24:17 in one form or another, right? Dude, that's me. Nice. That's like you as a Muppet. Yeah, he's got
00:24:26 Muppet Nose Syndrome. There we go. Yes, that's what I'm doing. Thank you for taking
00:24:33 my everyday deuce interview with me. I hope you've enjoyed this wonderful evening. I asked this
00:24:40 because my mind's been completely in, like, my future as these are the, like, the, like, literally,
00:24:46 like, as we speak, the final days before I'm applying to college and if I don't get into any of
00:24:51 the ones that I applied to this year, it's real sad a little bit. So I've been thinking about,
00:24:56 you know, my future, if I get it, if I don't get in my, my path in life, what I want to do this year
00:25:01 in general. And so I've just been interested in these, I felt this way more or less for a couple
00:25:08 years now, but really it's sunken now. But I always feel like I'm on the precipice of something,
00:25:14 not just me personally. I know that feel, bro. Yeah. Yeah. I used to constantly say that phrase,
00:25:20 like, oh, I'm like on the cusp. Yeah. I always felt like, oh, I'm on the cusp. And a lot of the
00:25:25 times I was on the cusp, and then I crossed the cusp into a new cusp. Yeah. It's like you're,
00:25:30 oh, I'm on the cusp of 100,000 subs. And then I hit that. And then I'm like, oh, now I'm on the cusp
00:25:35 of 200,000 subs. And it's like, at some point, there must be some cusp that you round. And then
00:25:42 you go, I'm satisfied with having crossed this cusp. I don't need to cross another cusp. Do
00:25:47 you think it's possible? Do you think that's like a real thing? I think you're always going to want
00:25:51 to get to the next stage of something no matter what. You always want to be making progress.
00:25:57 Imagine if you retire, but you're still like a cabbage farmer. You're going to be like,
00:25:59 I want to farm these cabbages even fucking harder. Even if you don't get out of your
00:26:04 field, professional field, you're always going to want to get to a new cusp of something. Right.
00:26:08 For me, the thing that I want to do the most is I want to be able to work on more things that
00:26:15 aren't for-profit strictly by having the things that I work on that are for-profit make more
00:26:21 profit for less effort. So I want my for-profit ventures to reach a point where I have found the
00:26:28 perfect balance. Because with my main channel, for instance, it's always been for-profit and also
00:26:34 for-passion. And so it was always about getting better, covering material I wanted to cover and
00:26:41 stuff. But I reached a point where the things I sincerely want to do are not going to make my
00:26:47 channel more profitable. Just doing whatever I want, doing what would suit me best is not to
00:26:55 say that a type of video that I would super want to do wouldn't be successful, but just I don't
00:26:59 necessarily want to just do video. I like doing music a lot. I like working on other projects
00:27:05 that are just weird or not marketable. And so I still am not making as much money as I want to
00:27:13 be. So it's like, how can I make it so I can take time away from my main channel to go work on these
00:27:20 other things without that meaning that I no longer have the standard of living I want to reach?
00:27:26 So the biggest reason I've put so much egg in the basket of me and Nate doing a show together,
00:27:31 for instance, is that I think he and I could do a show that as long as the setup is perfect,
00:27:37 if everything is in its right place and all we have to do is just deliver, then it's a type of
00:27:45 content I can imagine being good for less effort in the individual production. Where me and Nate
00:27:54 just having a conversation can be an entertaining piece of media. And if it's well made, if it's
00:27:59 like well structured, then, you know, I think people would like it. And then like, if that's
00:28:04 where all our income comes from, I don't have to worry about making four main channel videos a month
00:28:10 or, you know, a certain number of Patreon exclusive podcasts or whatever, it could just be like, hey,
00:28:14 I go to work to do this fun video project, and the videos are good and people like them. And then I
00:28:20 go home and I just make weird songs and fucking learn to draw and write a book or something, you
00:28:26 know. Do we pay the editors enough to have them cut out things if we don't want to be in the podcast?
00:28:31 Yes, we do. Would you say it's fair that you are maybe not banking on this show taken off,
00:28:42 but you are putting most of your effort into the show you're doing with Nate? And do you think
00:28:49 that, how do I phrase this? Do you think that if this show does not take off or does not
00:28:58 succeed, you're going to be in deep shit? No, the opposite will be true, because-
00:29:04 It'll be way better than I expected. This is basically like a producer's sort of scam, like a
00:29:09 smoke screen. Well, like, like part of, this is part of why we're trying to talk about moving
00:29:15 somewhere cheaper. Like, where I am now, I kind of am in that kind of circumstance where it's like,
00:29:22 if I was putting my all into something me and Nate were doing and we lived here and it didn't
00:29:28 work out, then it would be like, it would be, you know, harsher. But like, no matter how much work
00:29:33 I put into the thing I do with Nate, I still have the main channel. I still can do four videos a
00:29:38 month on it and make money, you know. And at this stage, like what's keeping that channel alive
00:29:44 is like, I just write a bunch of scripts and I send them to DeVoo and he edits them at whatever
00:29:50 rate he can and that frees me up to explore alternative business ventures. So like, that's
00:29:54 where I Am Games comes in. Like, I've probably spent more time on I Am Games than I have on my
00:29:58 main channel in the last three months. It just isn't as instantly profitable, but like, you know,
00:30:04 it is growing. So it's always like this weird constant like min-maxing of trying to figure out
00:30:10 like what can I do that will that will add profit to my life without taking away time for me to just
00:30:15 live and do what I want to do, you know, like what what business ventures will make me more money,
00:30:21 but I can still make an album every month or whatever.
00:30:24 There's a question I've been thinking about for a while and I've contemplated it myself,
00:30:29 being somebody who does YouTube and has a job. How much sense does it make to position yourself
00:30:35 as a YouTuber such that your primary focus is to basically clock in for your like, you know,
00:30:41 nine to five, like four days a week. Yeah, doing your YouTube show that like is your for-profit,
00:30:46 you have to do it. It's like you're there to be profitable as and then like and then you're spare.
00:30:52 Oh, now I get to do the funds. Well, I mean, at least you've got creative control. I mean,
00:30:56 that's a huge thing. That's a huge thing. I mean, the kind of show that we are playing that we're
00:31:01 trying to do is fun to do. Like, I agree. It's a type of show that I like watching and I like
00:31:07 creating. Like, I love red letter media. It's like, yeah, fucking half of the thing I consume on
00:31:12 YouTube. Please don't call it red letter media ripoff. It makes you sound so gay.
00:31:19 Just call it pleaven the weave with you and me, please. The pleaven the weave was founded as a
00:31:25 red letter media ripoff. Of course. That was the idea. It's all just a degrees of separation. It's
00:31:29 out of degrees of separation. I mean, I consider about not making us not sound like
00:31:33 if you ask me to describe the Digi Bro channel, I would say, oh, it's an ego wrapped ripoff or
00:31:38 it's a Mr. Plinkett ripoff. Like we've done videos in the voices. Like my biggest video series is
00:31:42 called Your Anime Sucks. It is a YMS ripoff. Like, I don't find anything wrong with that because
00:31:49 all creativity is a ripoff. Okay. I understand. I feel you. I think it's doing something that's
00:31:54 not a ripoff. All I'm saying is that I think you could describe the show in more flattering
00:31:59 to me. I mean, it's good. It's not just that. The reason I like to describe it that way is that
00:32:05 like that to me is like a really intense promise because like nobody does higher quality versions
00:32:11 of this style of content than red letter media to say we're doing a red letter media ripoff.
00:32:16 Like we're going to it's like saying we're going to hit that level of quality and that to me,
00:32:21 if somebody tells me I want to make a video that level, then I think, oh, shit, like that's serious.
00:32:27 Ripoff is not a flattering term whatsoever. It's extremely like derivative. I mean, well, yeah.
00:32:35 Everything's extremely derivative. I used that wrong. I used that word wrong. I mean, it's bad.
00:32:41 Derogatory. That's what I was thinking. Yeah. Anyway, I'm not even honest. I don't even give a
00:32:47 shit. Like if everybody thinks it's a shillgasm, then whatever. Like all that matters is when the
00:32:52 episodes come out, if they're entertaining, I don't give a fuck if you literally think it is a
00:32:57 straight ripoff. If you watch it and you like it, that is what matters, you know?
00:33:02 It's not like red letter media fucking invented the two man talking.
00:33:05 Sure. No. It's just Teebacked that. Yeah. That's right. That's right. Fuck yeah. We're
00:33:11 going to go back, dude. So almost there. The biggest things that will set us apart is we have a very,
00:33:18 like obviously we're going to bring our unique aesthetic, our unique approach to comedy and
00:33:24 who's ours. Whoever's involved. Anybody who happens to be on the show, just like with
00:33:29 Pleeve and the Weed, where it was me and Jesse's unique voices and then everybody else who got
00:33:35 involved, every guest episode had some of that person in it. The episode with Munchy is a very
00:33:43 Munchy take on the Pleeve and the Weed. God, I wish it wasn't.
00:33:46 It's old Munchy. Very, very 2018 Munchy. Oh yeah, 2018. Back in the day.
00:33:57 Yeah. Completely different. Now I'm only quiet Munchy. What's up guys? Quiet Munchy is back
00:34:03 for this episode. Just wanted to say that I'm having a good time. My mom's upstairs and doesn't
00:34:10 want to hear me recording. She says I'm banned from recording on the PCP if I'm doing it secretly.
00:34:15 What's up guys? It's me, daddy. I'm here to record a daddy rap. My actual real life father is
00:34:20 upstairs and he can't know that I have a daddy's fashion or something like that. Or else he might
00:34:26 be too happy and decided to do stuff that even I won't go to. We better just not open that can of worms.
00:34:33 Talking about Digi, talking about being the cusp of things. I guess just like future stuff is on
00:34:41 the mind and I want to know how everyone is doing because I feel like, I mean, I don't know, what
00:34:47 tale is all this time? We don't talk that much in the PCP chat. We do way more than we used to.
00:34:56 But I mean, I feel like I know what Ben is up to. I feel like me and Ben hang out. We have our own
00:35:03 venues. Yeah. I mean, I just assume everybody knows what I'm up to because it's always the same thing.
00:35:07 I have no idea. You know what I'm, what do you think I'm doing? Well, I guess what you just told me
00:35:13 just now. I mean, well, that's like future plans. But like, what do you think I'm doing? I think
00:35:18 you're sitting in your room and you're writing all day for anime reviews. That's not even slightly
00:35:22 close to true. Okay. Well, I don't know. I write maybe an anime review like three days out of the
00:35:28 month. Okay. I spend a lot of time on I Am Games and just having living life. I mean, I spend a lot
00:35:36 of time watching anime for a finish or no finish or fail. Yeah, finish or fail. Hey, wait, Digi,
00:35:42 you paid me $100. Do you not want to use the intro? Is something wrong with it? Like? Oh,
00:35:47 that was the intro for the other for like the the main channel version of finish or fail,
00:35:53 which I canceled because it costed a lot of money and didn't get any views. Okay. So you're just
00:35:58 going to not use that? I mean, I could. I didn't even think about it. Like, I literally never even
00:36:03 considered. I'm not scorned. I'm just saying get your money's worth out of me. You're absolutely
00:36:08 right. I just never thought about it at all. But uh, yeah, I'll do it. I'll put it in there.
00:36:16 So hard to make. Going back slowly to the topic I was saying before, I'm just wondering for my
00:36:21 future plans, if one day I'm making weaguas and I'm just like, man, I sure hate making these. Sure,
00:36:29 don't enjoy doing this job that I have to do to live. And I guess I'm wondering if
00:36:34 if youtubers are way too spoiled and whiny babies, because like I go to my job, I go to my job five
00:36:41 days a week and I put in my hours, like whatever, more than eight hours or whatever every fucking day.
00:36:47 And like, it's it's nice that I can my job is that I can't really leave it at the door. I have to
00:36:52 check emails and be on top of stuff. It's a real professional job. But like, to a degree, you can
00:36:58 kind of leave things there and you can leave. I feel like I don't want to give youtubers too much
00:37:03 fucking shit. But I do feel like the burnout rate, just specifically in the sense of like,
00:37:08 you're still doing your stuff, but you're just like, man, this sucks. I don't want to do it. And
00:37:12 then things just take longer to come out. The fucking the weird thing about youtubers is that like,
00:37:17 you make up yourself what your obligations are. That's true. And something I've been trying to do,
00:37:22 and this is kind of like my it was sort of my resolution going into the new year, was that I
00:37:28 wasn't going to like, meme myself into believing I had to do any particular thing. Because like,
00:37:35 I'll get it in my head where I'll be like, Oh, I have to do a video about like this type of show
00:37:40 or this length or this whatever. And like, I have to launch this venture and like, at the end of the
00:37:45 day, like, what succeeds or fails is so like up to chance. And so like, there's predictable elements
00:37:53 to it. But like, what people will want from me. Like, you know, maybe I make a video that is about
00:38:00 like the newest show. And I talk about it for 35 minutes. And I'm analytical. I'm funny. And the
00:38:04 video gets 300,000 views. Probably I'll gain some patrons based on it. But also, maybe I like, release
00:38:12 some random song. And like, one guy's like, that's my favorite song, I'm pledging $40. And like,
00:38:18 that's a better return on investment. Right. And it was just something I wanted to do. You know,
00:38:22 so it's like, yeah. And this, this is kind of what happened to me last year was that like,
00:38:27 when I went monthly with my Patreon, the idea was that it was just you're paying for everything I do
00:38:32 on the internet. Yeah. And there were some people who like, I have patrons who don't even watch my
00:38:37 main channel content who are like, I don't give a fuck about anime. I don't care.
00:38:40 We're the hardest of the hardcore audience, the one deepest in your shit. Yeah. Like, if I go down
00:38:45 a route where I'm only trying to appeal to those guys, I start losing patrons who only care about
00:38:50 the main channel. And if I only do main channel videos, I start losing patrons. Like, there was
00:38:55 a period where it seemed like everybody was telling me they wanted me to do like, big, long,
00:38:59 serious videos again. So I went, okay, I spent like a whole month on this Makoto Shinkai video.
00:39:05 And like, it came out and people enjoyed it. But it like, it wasn't enough. Yeah. Because a lot
00:39:10 of my fans were like, well, you like, this was not worth losing you for a whole month. It wasn't
00:39:15 worth not getting my deluge of podcasts that I listen to every day or my all my random vlogs,
00:39:21 you know. So like, at the end of the day, I always have to strike a balance between these people.
00:39:25 And the best way to do that is to just do what makes sense in the moment, because everyone
00:39:31 responds to passion. Like everyone, I did these couple of boogie pop vlogs, because there's new
00:39:37 boogie pop anime started. And like, everybody who watched them was like, this is my favorite
00:39:41 listening to you talking about anime forever, because I clearly care a lot.
00:39:45 I didn't watch this yet. But I when I saw this, I immediately hit the spark of, oh, I bet did
00:39:48 you really give a shit about this? And I was like, watch these at some point. Anyone else?
00:39:55 I'm starting to feel like an icy draft blow across my, you are, you are shoeless. I am
00:40:00 shoeless. I'm most sockless. Do you want me to turn the heater on? I mean, it won't affect the
00:40:04 audio. I could, I could do it. Hey, I got it. I could do with the heater. Wait, wait, hold on.
00:40:09 I just want to say, I'm not texting anyone. I'm not sexting. Don't worry. I'm writing down notes
00:40:14 on my phone. So don't think I'm not paying attention, talking to the audience exclusively.
00:40:18 Cool. On, on this, this point of not meeting yourself into oblivion, I, I like that. And I was,
00:40:25 I've been thinking about that recently. And that's kind of what I've done. Like, uh, uh, but like,
00:40:29 if I wanted to, if I was so inclined, I could announce today, guys, uh, just letting you know,
00:40:35 not making the ghost in the shell video, just letting you know, it's not happening. I'm doing
00:40:39 other things. If I did that, that's going to be a sound bite. What would be the real consequences
00:40:45 of that? A few people would probably be a little grumpy and maybe a few like hardcore fans would
00:40:50 feel jilted and might like unpledged. But my channel has grown beyond this like promise I made
00:40:57 years ago. I'm still going to make it. But I, when I think about like people, this is fascinating
00:41:02 to me. I think so many YouTubers box themselves into a corner with their, and just like,
00:41:08 they didn't even plan to get there, but where they find themselves in, they feel trapped.
00:41:13 And honestly, I don't even blame them. I think this is some sort of weird psychological prison
00:41:17 we built ourselves. I will say this, that like, I've put myself in a position where people do
00:41:21 get mad at me for canceling projects just because I cancel so many projects. Because to me, it's like,
00:41:27 I have an idea for a huge series that if it does succeed, I will go through this whole series.
00:41:34 But if I put out episode one and nobody gives a shit, then there's no reason to continue the
00:41:38 series. Like I created it under the impression it could be a huge success. So like, because I've
00:41:44 done that so many times, there are people who are like, you know, I start up a series and they're
00:41:48 like, I refuse to get excited about anything you're going to do. Maybe they don't like the,
00:41:53 I mean, if you make episode one of anything might not turn out as great as the idea could
00:41:57 potentially be flushed out to be. So maybe that's what the criticism is about. But sometimes it's
00:42:02 just like, sometimes like, for instance, with that finish or fail that you did the intro for,
00:42:06 like, I had written that in a relatively quick fashion thinking that it would be a one or two
00:42:11 week turnaround for editing. And it ended up being a whole month turnaround. And like, because of that,
00:42:18 it had the impression of Digi Bro didn't put out a video all month. And then because of that,
00:42:23 it only got it only got 60,000 views. And I was counting on it getting like 300,000 views. So
00:42:29 like, it was and I had poured a lot of money into it. So it was like, both the money and time.
00:42:34 It's like, I couldn't have afforded to do it again. If it was only if I was gonna have to wait for it
00:42:39 to build. So you're saying that in the end, you decided not to salvage the idea, but to slaughter.
00:42:45 Is that actually canikers? Thanks to actually do this. Yeah, I heard it. I heard it. I didn't believe
00:43:11 it. But I heard it for myself. He has two little plastic no he has a plastic gun and like a price
00:43:16 checker. He's got a magic gun. Where'd he purchase that cat, Icarus. Link sling car. That's the joke.
00:43:23 That's the joke. Tectonic improv. We were listening to Digi. Hey, I think a lot of people who might
00:43:29 not be in the Digi sphere, but in the journal piece of piece here, because I'm sure you've explained
00:43:33 this in Patreon podcasts and stuff like that. I'm sure a lot of people will want to know, like,
00:43:39 what the fuck was up with like being so weird and weird all the time. What if you mean like with
00:43:47 the weird like visuals in my videos? No, no, no, not like that. But I mean, like, making all like,
00:43:53 like, dude, we're fucking entering a new age, we're in the gecko estate, I'm gonna make all these
00:43:57 fucking high quality videos nonstop, you know, fucking a market marketing that marketing show,
00:44:03 how they marketed, fucking finish your fail, high average from now on, how they market a giant
00:44:10 so long fucking series for two fucking years, gonna go crazy, get ready for this shit, dude.
00:44:15 I have a YouTube thing, I have a YouTube thing to say Digi. Remember, I think it was a cool,
00:44:25 sorry, did I interrupt? No, fine, do it. Did I? Okay, do it. I think it was Digi does anime and
00:44:32 you put the footage in like a little tiny TV, like to get around copyright. That was just what
00:44:36 I was doing on my channel for like a year. Yeah, well, because it was the, it was before I realized
00:44:41 that you could just use 10 second clips. Well, I was making, I was making the Winnie the Pooh video,
00:44:45 and I tried, I used 10 second clips, but it's still got copyright claims. That's Disney shit.
00:44:49 Yeah, because that's Disney shit. So I had to use 10 second clips and put it in a tiny TV and
00:44:55 fuck with the contrast and brightness and put over like a static overly video effects on it,
00:45:00 just to get around copyright protection and have it, and have it monetizable.
00:45:04 And people in the comments were like, nice, nice Digi bro, Digi does anime reference, dude.
00:45:09 And I'm like, no, no, this is art out Digi. This is art out of adversity. I would never.
00:45:14 Well, okay, so Digi, you can see a silly sigh, just what the fuck was with avant-garde Digi
00:45:21 trying to do weird, like, hugely ambitious projects for a while and then just like stop
00:45:26 literally moved to Boston and lost all my money. Okay.
00:45:32 Well, because like last it was it started last year last December. I was like, I had been doing
00:45:41 just like nonstop deluge of small content. And some people liked it, some people didn't. And like,
00:45:48 people were like demanding that I start making like more meaningful shit again. So I was like,
00:45:52 okay, I'm going to make bigger, better videos. And I made a couple. And then I had an idea for
00:45:57 like, because like I had rewatched like a bunch of Jesse's videos, like the whole horseshoe
00:46:03 saga, I rewatched like a bunch of demolition D videos. And like, basically, I was like, man,
00:46:08 I really want to do more with the medium of video, like I don't want my stuff to just be
00:46:13 because my usual style is I just write a script, like without the impression it's going to be a
00:46:19 video. Like I just write it like an anime blog post like I used to back in the day. And then I
00:46:23 send it to DeVu and he edits it. And like he can go really crazy with the editing if he wants to,
00:46:29 or if I like, you know, request that this video be like really, you know, over the top. But like,
00:46:35 I wanted it to be better integrated stuff like stuff that was made for video that made sense
00:46:40 best as video. And so like the best idea I had of like, how can I talk about anime in a way
00:46:49 that will stay interesting will allow me to talk about big popular shows without having to review
00:46:54 them. But like I can talk about their history and like interesting stuff about them. So how they
00:46:58 marketed the whole idea was like, I can talk about Attack on Titan or something, and it's not an
00:47:05 Attack on Titan review, it's how they marketed Attack on Titan. And then I talk about the marketing
00:47:09 and then the way I would market the show was that each show I talked about,
00:47:14 I would market my video the same way the show was marketed. So the whole gimmick was supposed to be
00:47:19 that like, if for instance, there was a show where it had like a heavy Twitter presence,
00:47:23 then I would make a Twitter for this video and like do something similar to what they had done
00:47:29 that I talked about in the video. And the main thing that this all hinged on was that episode
00:47:34 two was supposed to be about Pop Team Epic. And Pop Team Epic marketed itself by having a whole
00:47:39 like ton of different artists contribute like short pieces to the show. And like all of it was
00:47:45 like stuff that could survive as Twitter video or as gifts. So like there was tons and tons of
00:47:50 people posting like three minute clips from Pop Team Epic on Twitter. And the show was created
00:47:54 as a marketing gimmick. Like that was the idea. They looked at this comic and they said we could
00:47:58 do all kinds of marketing experiments with it. So I was going to make that the second episode
00:48:04 of how they marketed the first one was more to explain basic marketing principles. And then
00:48:08 the second one would just be like utterly insane. And I was going to hire all of you to do parts for
00:48:13 it like hire everybody I knew to do like little three minute bits and then market it heavily
00:48:18 through Twitter and all this shit. And like it was going to be this big sprawling thing to just
00:48:24 have popular content that's actually good. Like it was just how can I make something that's both
00:48:29 good and will be successful by marketing it. So yeah, I started working on it. But the thing is
00:48:36 that episode one took too long to make partly because I got involved in several other big
00:48:40 projects at the same time where I started making a documentary and I started doing this other
00:48:44 shit and I was looking for a house. So it was like I just didn't put enough time into getting
00:48:50 episode one out the out the door. And then when I moved it was like I lost so much patronage
00:48:57 from the amount of time I had spent like working on all these big videos that I was like well
00:49:02 now I can't afford to take any more time away to work on big videos. I need to get the content
00:49:07 machine running again. So as soon as I moved in here I immediately launched the gecko estate
00:49:11 because the idea was these will be like hour and a half long videos that will appeal to my core fans
00:49:16 like the people who are unsubbing right now, the people who are unpaturing, which funnily enough
00:49:21 while a lot of those people did like it some of them had just stopped following me in general.
00:49:26 And so they just didn't even watch those videos like so there was no opportunity to like bring
00:49:30 those people back into the fold because they just weren't even paying attention.
00:49:33 But like you know so that was my first plan and then I was like oh my god living here
00:49:38 is expensive and I still haven't paid my taxes. I need to just work on making money for a while.
00:49:43 So then I was like now I'm gonna make fucking all populist videos and like
00:49:48 when how they marketed episode one was complete I just didn't like it enough. Like I didn't think
00:49:55 it was worth posting or continuing because it wasn't at the level of quality I wanted it to be on
00:49:59 because it was supposed to be an expensive venture. Like I was going to buy materials to build sets
00:50:05 and to like you know have poster arrays and have like people's art in it and like that was why you
00:50:11 know like for Finish or Fail I hired both you and Tom like I think 50 bucks a piece to do art for it
00:50:17 and like what did Tom do? Tom made a CG can of beer that I used very briefly at various parts of
00:50:24 the video because that one of the shows like the Finish or Fail ending has a preview for how they
00:50:29 marketed and one of the shows was like a show made as a marketing campaign for beer. So I had Tom
00:50:36 make me a beer to like show the way that they had done it you know. Anyway point being that like I
00:50:42 was intending to spend a lot of money on it and then when I couldn't spend money on it like when I
00:50:47 didn't have the money to spend it just meant the show wasn't gonna be what I imagined. And so like
00:50:52 by the time I could have even started on episode two I couldn't have paid a bunch of artists to
00:50:56 work on it if it was going to be Potthym Epic. Potthym Epic wasn't relevant anymore so it wasn't
00:51:00 going to be like real flash video. Right. So what you're saying is may ruin your content.
00:51:08 Got it. Thank you for validating my theories all along.
00:51:12 Make Tao. Make Tao. Make Tao. Make Tao. Make Tao.
00:51:16 Do you think that the hello market could come back when you have more money?
00:51:20 I mean I basically just came to the conclusion that the only way it would be possible is with a
00:51:25 Kickstarter campaign behind it. Like it would have to be funded up front because no matter what
00:51:30 it's going to be expensive and it's like it's just not it's not worth the turnaround like what I like
00:51:37 it was born out of this existential ennui of like I want to do content that will succeed but I also
00:51:43 want to do content I will personally think it's good. Watching demolition D videos will do that too.
00:51:48 Even though I really only think that he had like a couple of great videos towards the end of his
00:51:53 career like he was getting better and better. He retired right after he made like the best videos
00:51:59 he had done and then it was just like he's gone. I have two questions. First one just just to know.
00:52:04 So what you're saying is is that you're you were going to make all these crazy videos and then you
00:52:09 ran out of money and so you didn't and it just is like that's over and yeah it's pretty much I mean
00:52:15 it's just it couldn't it was no longer feasible and it still is not feasible. Okay okay sick all right
00:52:21 I want to know specifically what was the inspiration behind the the meme of marketing like this marketing
00:52:27 because marketing is a way to like I was looking at how does marketing like lost like all meaning
00:52:36 because it was used like in every single sentence you ever said for like months. Well yeah it was
00:52:41 it was a meme. The point of it was to create a meme that would make that was the marketing. Okay okay
00:52:47 my attempt to market the show was to constantly remind people of the show and just say how they
00:52:52 marketed how they marketed how they marketed as a series of the narrative how they marketed a series
00:52:57 of the narrative like you would just get it in your head and you would have to fucking see the
00:53:00 thing at that point you know. I mean that's what marketing is. When it dropped. Just repeat yourself
00:53:05 constantly. When the when how they marketed dropped I was like oh it's that thing it's that thing I've
00:53:09 heard. Yeah I've heard this and what is it. Wait wait wait does this brand have merchandise?
00:53:15 Whoa whoa whoa whoa. It has branding. It has the market. It has content. It has the other one that
00:53:21 starts with an M. Marketing. What was actually released was not like what episode one like I
00:53:27 stripped off the first like seven minutes of it that was like all because like originally the first
00:53:33 part of the video is all just establishing context of like what like how shows are marketed in
00:53:38 general. It was like all live action so it was like all these parts of me like using whiteboards
00:53:42 and stuff to explain. Does that exist anywhere in the world? Yeah well I haven't posted it online
00:53:47 yet. At the end of that video I'm like become a patron and you'll be able to see the uh the
00:53:52 uncut version and I never put that version together. Boy make that I want to see that intro. I want to
00:53:58 see the director's cut. It's like six it's like six minutes but the audio was not very good and
00:54:02 like we had just moved in so the house is weirdly barren and like it just looked and sounded like
00:54:09 shit and like DeVu I had thought like because I was doing a style at the time where I was occasionally
00:54:16 doing heavily edited vlogs or like I would just talk into the camera but then I would add tons of
00:54:20 shit on time. Was wearing an onion on my belt. That was the style at the time. I had expected it to
00:54:24 be like that but when I sent it to DeVu he didn't really add that much to that section and the stuff
00:54:28 he did add was like weird and jarring because I just didn't give him enough direction I guess.
00:54:34 So just that whole section I hated it and like he had finished it like almost two months before
00:54:39 I released it. I just was like well this is this I don't even want to look at it because I'm so
00:54:45 disappointed with it and I still had to do all those commercials that are in there which were
00:54:50 all just patron backer rewards so like so anything weird about the video is because it's not the
00:54:55 video it was supposed to be like it would have made sense but like because I'd already given up on
00:55:00 it it was just kind of like let's cut this thing in such a way that I can ship it out and then never
00:55:04 have to think about it again. Dan it's interesting because we always make fun of like producers who
00:55:09 do those things with movies. It's usually out of necessity you know. Yeah of course like nobody
00:55:13 wants to make like a bad movie I'm not even saying it was a bad video or anything but yeah I still
00:55:17 liked it. I still wish there was a number two. There could be in the future but it would be like
00:55:25 the approach I had because I had like a huge list of shows I was going to do and it was going to end
00:55:29 in like a three-part like film length like movie that was going to be How They Marketed Digi Bro
00:55:35 so like well there was going to be How They Marketed How They Marketed and then How They Marketed
00:55:39 Digi Bro. Oh the ultimate how they marketed when you kill yourself and then as a martyr as a
00:55:44 sacrificial artist that's the ultimate marketing tool. Why do you remember Van Gogh? Because he was
00:55:49 like gay or something right? Well the ultimate sacrifice being gay. He must have. I think he
00:55:57 did kill. I know he cut off his ear. I think he killed himself. I thought he died if I could
00:56:00 disease him. Because he only ever saw one painting two his like brother-in-law and I'm pretty sure
00:56:04 he killed himself. I'm not sure. He might I'm not sure Hemingway killed himself. There's him.
00:56:08 Yeah yeah yeah. What he's most known for is killing himself. David Foster Wallace if that even
00:56:13 is his real name. He killed himself. Hunter S. Thompson killed himself. Why Hunter S. Thompson
00:56:18 do it? I'm going to kill myself. Okay. He was like no. He was in his 70s but like if you watch videos
00:56:26 of him at the time. Guys if you need if you need to talk to someone call the suicide hall. His life
00:56:30 style had taken a toll on him. Yeah right. Didn't seem like life was probably that enjoyable. Girls
00:56:34 if you want to commit suicide call my number stand. I'll be out dude. But uh apparently like Hunter
00:56:41 Thompson had said at some point that like the one thing that kept him like that kept him going was
00:56:46 knowing that at the very least he had power over his own life that like he could like knowing he
00:56:50 could kill himself at any time was like a source of strength for him. Okay. And then one day he just
00:56:55 fucking was like well I'm tired. Time to catch this check I've been writing for the last 20 years.
00:57:00 Well I mean it's 70. Not bad. Yeah not bad. I think he was in his 70s. So I feel like it's
00:57:07 probably pretty uncommon for people to kill themselves at that age. I feel like most most
00:57:11 suicides are probably younger people. Most suicides aren't older people. Really? Yeah.
00:57:15 Yeah. Old people kill themselves. I mean it's probably like a spike at youth and then like a
00:57:19 low or whatever. I mean it's like when you're young even if you fuck up your life really bad
00:57:25 you're like well at least I'm young. And you're also like physically resilient and more likely to
00:57:31 survive the attempt. I think also yeah Thomas like yeah I mean old people falling in the back
00:57:37 knocking the door down. Thank you fucking god. Okay what would it be fair to say that instead of
00:57:43 trying to do all these these big big budget blockbusters you're trying to settle down and
00:57:49 make things work which have already proven themselves. Like right now I'm just like running
00:57:54 every imaginable get rich quick scheme I can. It's not about getting rich quick though it's about
00:58:00 how does this sustain a long term business model. Maybe that's what you mean though.
00:58:03 But like yeah okay get rich in the long term. Yeah yeah it is. Like for instance something
00:58:11 me and Tom have been working a lot towards is defining alternative revenue sources. So like
00:58:17 doing things like selling merch or like more intimate products because like the videos themselves
00:58:25 it's like it's hard to define what people want or what they're like how do you tell somebody
00:58:32 like what your videos are worth or like something one guy might think that the main channel video
00:58:37 I spent a month on sucked and he doesn't care. And then the next guy is like oh this uh this
00:58:43 like three minute video of you just like ranting about something is my favorite thing you've ever
00:58:48 made. So it's like it always comes down to just like this vague sense that people pledge because
00:58:54 they just kind of like me in general and or like the way things are going but like if you're selling
00:59:01 a t-shirt then it's like the t-shirt is worth $20. If you pay for it you get the t-shirt you know.
00:59:08 And so like having those less complicated things mixed up in it is it's comforting to know that
00:59:13 there's like a product you've assigned a value to people are paying that that amount to get that thing
00:59:19 and there's no questions about it there's no like feelings involved it's just like buy things you
00:59:24 like you know. I do like Patreon has always been like a weird model uh yeah yeah but we've talked
00:59:30 about that before. And also just like you know a lot of a lot of our reliance on Patreon has always
00:59:36 come down to like the most hardcore people will pledge the most money but like you can also just
00:59:41 get people to give you money for things like a lot of a lot of those hardcore fans while they
00:59:47 like because it's such a weird and vague sense of like how much a video is worth they just
00:59:53 basically pledge whatever they think they can afford long term. Yeah. Whereas if you sell them
00:59:58 something they might even pay you like like let's say we made a t-shirt every month there are some
01:00:04 people who might only pledge like two dollars on Patreon but because there is a concrete product
01:00:09 and they want to support us it's like oh I'll give you $20 every time you make a new shirt
01:00:14 you know and that's basically a $20 Patreon you know. Yeah more like they just feel more
01:00:19 aggressive about it. Right exactly and there there are a lot of people who like don't even really
01:00:23 give us money but we'll buy products we sell. I'm sure yeah there's plenty of those. You know what's
01:00:27 always struck me as interesting though with the Patreon model it's the people who are the most
01:00:32 into you and feel like maybe they like I am not the kind of person who donates to anyone's Patreon
01:00:38 that's not who I am but my patrons obviously are and everyone's patrons are so I'm not trying
01:00:44 to shit on my patrons or anyone's patrons but like what the business model there relies on
01:00:49 attracting the people who are the most attracted to you and I immediately find that like a weird
01:00:55 relationship what I would much rather have is people who just generally kind of like me I would
01:01:01 rather have more of those than like the cult following who like really care because frankly
01:01:06 I can never have the kind of like one-on-one relationship that's kind of weirdly implied
01:01:11 by like being a patron or like part of a patron discord. I mean I wouldn't even call myself
01:01:17 sorry guys I don't think I'm friends with most of my patrons I think I'm associates or like we
01:01:23 communicate and I am acquaintances. I mean at least acquaintances. My patrons have like kind of a
01:01:28 general fear of me of my irons. That's what I want for them. Me too. Me too Digi patron heads.
01:01:36 Nate I always I've always liked about Patreon. I always I've always enjoyed the fact that
01:01:41 theoretically I could subsist on only a few people. Well you know I don't like it though.
01:01:46 I feel weird about people like I don't know like like you got like cam girls for example and cam girls
01:01:53 have a thing going on and I don't think youtubers who have patrons are too far away from a cam girl
01:01:58 especially me. Especially me. You got guys who give like thousands of dollars to some of these girls
01:02:05 or whatever and like that's obviously like a romantic thing and it's like they're doing it for
01:02:09 like a relationship almost and that's like weird and off-putting. Well to me I'm more than happy
01:02:16 and I genuinely want to have a relationship with the people following. I would consider many many
01:02:22 fans of me friends. I have an entire discord chat which Ben and hip are both in the golden
01:02:27 childhood founder. I would consider everyone and they're a friend and even some people who aren't
01:02:31 in there. I could name I could name drop easily dozens of people from our fck who I would consider
01:02:36 friends. Sure sure and who I like. I'm not saying I'm not saying there's nothing wrong with the way
01:02:42 you think I'm saying we think of things differently. Yeah and I feel the same way to a degree. Like
01:02:47 guys like Lee one of my biggest patrons he's been around for a long time. We get along quite well
01:02:51 we talk all the time I like my pager discord. I feel like it's weird to even quantify a relationship
01:02:57 that way but like I like him he's a patron but like there's this there's this monetary thing
01:03:01 that hangs over it that makes the whole thing a little bit strange not like a pure like friendship
01:03:06 we met up and we broed out or whatever and frankly I kind of like a more corporatized
01:03:13 sanitized thing or like honestly what it makes me think about is I feel like we are cultivating
01:03:20 YouTube shooters like instead of school shooters it's like YouTube shooters we're like getting
01:03:25 these people we're like teasing these people almost with like we're like people like me or
01:03:29 whatever uh they're like because I don't know like I attract a certain kind of guy who's like
01:03:34 alt-right migtail dangerous like my videos are like for basically past Nate as I feel like a lot
01:03:41 of people make stuff to like fix their mistakes along their path so knowing who I was probably
01:03:46 like lowly guys who are like you know uh don't know a lot of stuff about girls and or I don't know
01:03:52 maybe see me as a little bit of a role model and stuff well how mark what this is a big-ass
01:03:57 chapstick uh it's fucking it's blood orange flavor it's grunge I love it um hey this isn't a big
01:04:05 thing did I just invaded I just invaded the girls podcast yeah yeah yeah I was a male presence
01:04:13 invading a female space that's what they call rape my friend uh guilty as god
01:04:20 anyway just like red country you'll be able to fucking sync the videos together you can
01:04:25 find the part in your stream where ben did that and check out yeah so yeah watch it watch them on
01:04:31 two monitors they are live they're live on um fuck what's like what's your youtube yeah yeah the
01:04:37 how the cropping cropping your kids oh they're your kids okay what's cool uh I I completely
01:04:42 understand the want to have like like what did you say as well like a product you put out
01:04:47 they're paying for that I'm into building walls my yeah exactly that being strong beautiful strong
01:04:52 walls make good neighbors they do unironically why do you even have a picture just why not just
01:04:57 say like there are no rewards this is just unironically so that people will pledge me more
01:05:01 because they feel like they can get closer so I am absolutely yeah you're inviting this myself
01:05:06 absolute tap dance on that line of it that's correct no I've completely crossed the line I'm way
01:05:10 past uh yeah but I mean I mean I never would have known what it's like unless I try it so I mean you
01:05:15 know uh I'm not saying I'm gonna shut it down or anything I have no intention to I'm just the
01:05:20 relationship is interesting I frankly don't understand people who give money to people online
01:05:26 because I don't and I never have I mean I patron although you know what I'll say I almost even
01:05:32 you've been patroning me for a dollar a month for like two years meaning you've given me like
01:05:36 $20 and I appreciate that I've been patroning you five dollars like a million billion years
01:05:43 when I find myself in a situation where I can get a thing for free you got your you got your name
01:05:48 in the video you got your name in the poo video in the credits at the end what am I gonna choose
01:05:51 between free and paid like there is no choice I just well go to the free option maybe it's like
01:05:58 for a lot of people yeah we we make content that they like and it's like you know what you can you
01:06:04 read one piece for free but you'll buy volumes every now and then or you know like because you
01:06:09 like it that much I mean I from well let me say let me say this I'm a little bit of an idiot and
01:06:14 just talking out of my ass because I actually was very tempted the other day to pledge to nexus mania
01:06:19 as the only person I've ever been even tempted to patron to because he just seems like such a hard
01:06:24 worker and deserves good things in his life true and for that brief moment when I didn't actually
01:06:29 pledge I sort of understood I believe a lot of it is like a sense of like be the change you want to
01:06:37 see in the world because that's always how I've approached it is like I patron people because
01:06:41 I want this type of content to feel as though it can continue yes you know it's like I I see like
01:06:49 someone like me um you know I have a even if I talk about a lot of popular things and even if my
01:06:55 opinions are shared by a lot of people I generally have unpopular opinions yeah and like yeah if you
01:07:01 want to be like you know really really popular sorry usually pays to have the popular opinions
01:07:08 yes so if people are like hey you have an unpopular opinion that I share I want to make sure that you
01:07:15 are able to keep having your voice heard then like that's usually why and they'll they'll give to
01:07:20 something like that and like most of the people who I would ask if they're not doing it for a reward
01:07:25 tier like if they're just giving money with with that they don't care about the rewards it's almost
01:07:29 always some kind of like yeah I want to prove a point by like giving money to this I think it for
01:07:36 me I want to align myself with this that too for me I don't pledge to a lot currently but I want
01:07:43 to pledge to way more for me it's as simple as I mean what everyone says at the end of the video
01:07:47 if like it's content please yeah that's why I've been a long time patron of Japanese emoticons
01:07:53 yeah me that's true uh there's I use their services and I appreciate the what they bring
01:08:00 to the table culturally there are many small youtubers with small patreons small penises
01:08:05 and small penises as well that I genuinely think you know there's a good chance if this person
01:08:10 doesn't make money and they'll just stop these people are making content which I love and I watch
01:08:15 like every week do I want that to stop no I want to make sure that I that I just personally get to
01:08:23 have this content in my life yeah I mean in my opinion in many ways it comes back to benefit me
01:08:29 as somebody who has a patreon yeah because like it normalizes patreon to have more people on there
01:08:35 there's more people like it like the more people are successful through it the more people will
01:08:40 get one the more the cultural understanding will be that you can promote art this way yeah and so
01:08:47 it's like you know in some way just like being a part of that system will come back around to help
01:08:52 me as a creator too you know shout out to walters world travel youtube series he's like a dad I feel
01:08:59 the same way I feel like you know if you're a patreon person you know it's nice it's nice it's nice
01:09:06 to at least it's nice to be putting your money where your mouth is a little bit so I don't pledge
01:09:10 that much but like I think I pledged like a dollar to the hippo I think I pledged a dollar to mage
01:09:15 and maybe like actually japanese emoticons dot me might might be it that might be yeah that might be
01:09:20 I also like until moving here I just had like more money than I knew what to do with so like
01:09:26 the part of the reason I would patron people is it's just like well you need the money more than I do
01:09:31 so I guess I haven't been in that position yeah like if I if I have like it's like a lot of the
01:09:37 people I patron it's either because I am a huge fan or I'm a friend of theirs or I just like
01:09:44 legitimately like their content more than my own yeah like if I watch somebody and they have a
01:09:49 patreon and I think like this guy is an inspiration to me then it's like I feel as though I am getting
01:09:56 something like like I'm getting something tangible from them like yeah you made this video that was
01:10:02 amazing and it made me want to go make something amazing and I'm gonna give you money for like
01:10:07 in trade for that that all makes sense I guess it's just a little bit of the objectivist in me
01:10:12 that just says my job in life is to make me as good as I can possibly be including monetarily
01:10:19 so I'm just gonna hoard all my money and build myself up so I can be the you know a fucking
01:10:25 rock eventually you will have so much money that you eventually not know although I could also see
01:10:31 you just putting all of that into a fund for your kids college or something so like certainly that
01:10:36 would be on the on the to-do list for life at some point yeah I mean like if I was a millionaire
01:10:41 this would be a different a different ball game but I am not I am not close in them give it another
01:10:47 month or two give another give another patreon.com slash best yeah see how it goes I can't wait to
01:10:52 become a millionaire and the federal reserve sent you the gold play button yeah yeah oh my god
01:11:02 I wish real life was as cool as you did you just send me a gold dollar bill did you guys I don't
01:11:08 know who this was they said you're a gold tombstone random guy I saw on Twitter today but I just
01:11:13 saw some dude just said like so this is a cool interaction I had with YouTube he's like hey guys
01:11:19 like at Team YouTube whatever I've got 158,000 subscribers and yet you said you're like denying
01:11:25 me getting my silver play button could you tell me why they said like hey we've reviewed this and
01:11:30 apparently you've either violated our content guidelines or you've got too many strikes it's
01:11:34 like okay here's the thing though I have no strikes and my I have not violated the content
01:11:40 guidelines in any way would you care to tell me how though we cannot comment any further you are
01:11:44 ineligible for the button but like I don't know where I fucking saw it was just on Twitter somewhere
01:11:49 but uh fuck YouTube I guess is the point just just I still don't have a silver play button it's been
01:11:55 fucking you gotta talk to him again dude YouTube just would be so better off if they just all you
01:12:00 could do nothing differently in this situation but just explain the reason because if you don't
01:12:04 explain it it looks like you're hiding something how many new people how many new people yeah past
01:12:10 the hundred thousand like every week like it can't be that many it can't be that many no I mean I don't
01:12:15 know what maybe a hundred I would I don't know be surprised if it was even that many yeah I mean
01:12:20 sure there's some data on that something there's probably data by the way I'm coming soon you better
01:12:24 have that fucking silver play button ready for me because I'm coming for it YouTube I'm gonna
01:12:28 want it day one so get to work I mean coming for that gold I'm coming for that diamond I never
01:12:35 get it Nate they they sell uh face diamond 10 million I've seen that I've seen the fake ones
01:12:39 right that's what I'm gonna get I want that fucking button when I cross a hundred or now
01:12:47 they get you give a plaque instead of a button now why maybe when I hit 20,000 I'll like carve one
01:12:51 for myself out of like balsa wood yeah good idea did you and Nate yeah real question why are you
01:12:58 both doubling down on two companies which you both hate because YouTube is still the biggest game in
01:13:05 town and for the cut for what I'm doing it's by far the best option will you switch if there is a
01:13:09 genuine actual real alternative capillary alternative you know what I'm probably just upload
01:13:15 to both and then just like play the fucking field because why not just I'll optimize on every plan
01:13:20 I mean I'm thinking of doing like a bit shoot and shit it's just that I don't really think my content
01:13:25 is in the realm of like danger for being like destroy like with Viagra the goal of Viagra I
01:13:30 will tailor my fucking shit to work on YouTube whatever that requires I will do it it is a business
01:13:37 to succeed on YouTube requires frequent uploads oh there it go I would say that you
01:13:44 damn boy yeah thanks um you survive somewhat because no one hates you
01:13:54 you're very good at not having enemies I feel like that's a lot of the reason why no one comes
01:13:58 out because I think it's because I'm a middle child and I'm the mediator of the fan you gotta you
01:14:02 gotta you know you it's just like it's just like it's just like Dale Carnegie says and ways to
01:14:07 fucking uh how to make friends how to make friends and and influence people yeah if you don't have any
01:14:11 enemies find a way to make some because the most steadfast allies are enemies you've turned into
01:14:16 friends it's just like how Skeeter says and Doug funny people are going wild for this pizza as Dale
01:14:23 Carnegie also says in how to win friends influence people tippy that yellow haired pup that my daddy
01:14:29 bought for me for 50 cents was the light and joy of my childhood until one tragic day he was killed
01:14:34 by lightning not 10 feet from my head anyway on to what else I was saying no further elaboration
01:14:41 you know uh it's a great book I uh it's true I don't seem to have many or any enemies even though
01:14:47 I've said some shit that people don't care for in the past these because I'm so damn conciliatory uh
01:14:52 and maybe it makes me I don't think I'm a pushover uh but I do think a lot about how to not fuck up my
01:15:00 life and that's a big one that's a big one not just making people hate me I mean whatever even on the
01:15:06 basically anytime you're in it I hate you name what are you talking about correct where you're
01:15:11 saying Tom every time we're even on the pcb and we have an argument like that like I've noticed
01:15:15 your strategy is basically to always like find a point of agreement or something or at least yeah
01:15:21 or at least say the words that kind of sound like you're agreeing well it's gonna help them they're
01:15:25 retarded because I hate so much like I could argue with a socialist all day I could say like no
01:15:29 capitalism's good and like a harder comic could be like no communism's good and like I'm sure they've
01:15:34 got good things about kindness like I'm sure I would say good things about capitalism like we're
01:15:38 wasting our time doing that shit what we need to be is go way the fuck back and be like okay so do
01:15:43 you think it's actually okay to like take the the the sweat off of someone's brow we like worked it
01:15:48 as capitalism would like say and they'd be like yeah for this reason I'm like okay here's why I
01:15:53 disagree and like but that's a meaningful debate not just like 400 million dead in Russia versus
01:15:59 you know like the poor the working poor are oppressed in the whole west or you know the way
01:16:05 I feel exactly the same time I want to have productive debates slash arguments not just
01:16:09 waste my time this is the way it is for everyone on the pcb yeah where we all say something fucking
01:16:14 retarded and they're ever and else is like that's obviously stupid and then they dial up and then
01:16:19 we all dial it back to what our actual point is was easy which is extremely reasonable
01:16:24 like all agree on yeah yeah yeah I mean like personally like I I will go out of my way to
01:16:35 frame things as stupidly as possible it makes me so mad it's so the conversation can last longer
01:16:41 I mean like I'm trying to fill time on a show where we have to have like yeah we gotta talk about
01:16:47 something a big part of it is something that isn't even real honestly I've trained myself to speak
01:16:53 this way and like granted I've always been long-winded but like I have to put out hours and hours and
01:17:00 hours of content every week I can't really come up with new shit to say all the time and most
01:17:07 arguments have been had before so it's like how can we have this argument in a way that will be
01:17:13 really dumb and waste everyone's time so that we can fill in our content that is so true
01:17:21 we were kind of talking with with econ about this yesterday uh about like I mean at least I was like
01:17:26 the purpose of media and like is it not just kind of wasting everyone's fucking time to not just be
01:17:33 like like read a textbook on whatever it is you're arguing about don't fucking watch like uh the
01:17:38 Lion King to learn about why revenge is not whatever the fucking point of Lion King is uh but then
01:17:44 econ made a very reasonable point of uh what media does is it it's basically the Huey's law
01:17:49 should I say which is totally redundant whoever it's like it it packages a moral and you fucking
01:17:55 take it down you're like I learned why the lions are like good because it's bad to just kill people
01:18:00 and kill your you know your brother so that you can be king you shouldn't do that I don't know why
01:18:06 if it's a bad example a bad choice okay undertale undertale
01:18:13 is good the moral that's what I learned so I was a little bit cynical about like if if media even
01:18:21 has value because I feel as I think I said this before but as I go forth on my crusade to talk
01:18:27 about anime and video and shit I'm letting you know right now I'm gonna be talking about same
01:18:33 points forever it's just gonna it could recontextualize in the different show that happens to be the one
01:18:38 but the the fundamentals are the same and I've elaborated them many times in the pcp that's
01:18:43 what it's gonna be if you read any author or listen to any speaker yeah like that is what they do
01:18:49 yeah they just repeat themselves I mean does you have to do you try to speak the truth and I
01:18:53 guess you could say that it's about you want to find the one way they're able to deliver it aka
01:18:57 like the entertainment value that's applied to like perhaps that way you deliver that message
01:19:01 that actually gets people to swallow it I mean oh I get it now there's there's been a ton of my videos
01:19:06 that like people will watch it and go like oh you already said this in an after dark video yeah
01:19:12 but like in the after dark video it's like I just had this idea it's just exploding out of me for
01:19:18 like 25 minutes it's not really well phrased it's not like thought through and then like sometime
01:19:23 later I think about it again and I'm like oh now I know exactly how to put it in a way that more
01:19:28 people will understand and I can make like a full video out of it and so it's it's usually just about
01:19:34 like how can I keep repackaging this statement in ways that will give it different nuance make
01:19:40 different people understand it and make the content feel different you know yeah yeah that's the point
01:19:46 I guess like you know it was interesting I saw this guy um Aziz Ansari he's like uh he's like a
01:19:52 American Muslim activist and he's had like some arguments with like Sam Harris but wait he said
01:19:56 a very interesting thing one time he described him as an activist but he's like comedian an actor
01:20:00 oh sorry it's very famous it's not Aziz Ansari it's um it's Reza Aslan that's right yes I'm pretty
01:20:06 sure it's Reza Aslan that's who it is not not the comedian uh him and Sam Harris like had some
01:20:10 arguments and like a while back he just came out he's like I've been debating people on like
01:20:16 philosophy maybe his thing is like you know Islam is good you know we just need to like
01:20:20 whatever doesn't matter um he's he's making this point he's been like I've been debating people
01:20:25 like Sam Harris and other people forever nobody fucking cares it's not changing hearts and minds
01:20:30 got a better idea I'm going to make tv shows that like show positive Muslim characters and like this
01:20:37 is just what I'm doing now it's it's the point is the same it's like convince people that like you
01:20:42 know Muslims are good or whatever and uh this this is just gonna be a way better way of changing
01:20:46 hearts and minds and uh yeah that's media for you I guess I mean you gotta trick people into thinking
01:20:51 they came up with the idea themselves that yes yeah that sounds like Huey's long action indeed
01:20:56 they watch a show it's like got like I don't know like a Muslim kid maybe he was like bullied by like
01:21:01 the the mean Christian kid in that episode and then at the end the Christian kids like man you
01:21:05 know maybe we're not so different boom you just indoctrinated a thousand ISIS members right there
01:21:10 lining up in the fucking trenches uh yeah so I guess that's how I got there I guess that's literally
01:21:15 what I've been saying I'm doing only it's my philosophy not his philosophy which means it's
01:21:19 better which means it's better yeah I guess a lot of people do that and uh yeah I guess that's it
01:21:28 sip and tea like kermit over there but that's none of my business
01:21:33 but but but recruiting members of ISIS that's none of my business
01:21:38 anyway he says calling up his business agency we've got two more boys
01:21:42 yeah
01:21:45 on the bottom of the cup is like join

01:23:59 remember never mind never mind this is like this is like even better than self-control it's robot
01:24:04 oh god all these questions are already shit um this is why we don't do it anymore um these are all
01:24:11 bad why at the world we feel bad about your question um okay here we go this one all right
01:24:19 this is whatever kind of cool at rad a cool gamer asks what piece of media do you feel the worst
01:24:27 about liking the pcp avril Lavigne yeah what's that avril Lavigne's entire discography uh uh huh
01:24:36 a life's like this uh huh yeah that's the way that's the way it is and it is though but it is though
01:24:45 damn many of a type avril Lavigne is a choice life but she's into my japanese shit with her
01:24:52 hello kitty song she loves kakakawaii kakakawaii i never even heard that one before i think my answer
01:25:00 is he's singing parts i've heard a clip i saw a clip of it i think i feel the worst about liking
01:25:05 rap music from artists who are not okay with white people saying the n word i know what you mean
01:25:10 i know what you mean yeah yeah like when they adamantly in the songs are like yo white guys
01:25:16 don't be singing along to this shit and i'm just like come on guys like or like just a lot of there
01:25:21 are like a lot of rappers who have like an active disdain for their white audience hey i've got i've
01:25:26 got a question about that i've been i've been considering considering that issue do you think
01:25:30 because like okay if you are uh uh one of these people one of those people selling to the world
01:25:35 do you think it's is that a reasonable complaint to make considering that you're selling to a lot
01:25:40 of those white folks maybe if you said i don't want white people to talk about you've talked about this
01:25:45 before have we yeah yeah you know what i guess at the end of the day like the point of their music
01:25:51 is to be emotional to express how they feel so like if they feel uncomfortable with white people
01:25:57 saying the n word then like you know it's fine that they want to rap about that it's just like
01:26:04 when you're listening to something and it seems like it is attacking you personally and you can't
01:26:09 really argue back or you get the sense that this person would not be willing to listen to arguments
01:26:14 back then it's just kind of like you just can't help but get pissed off hearing it i know what you
01:26:19 mean i know what you mean uh monchi what are you most ashamed of like i i don't really have any media
01:26:25 that i'm ashamed of i mean i i like every i don't believe in like guilty pleasures really i like
01:26:31 everything that i like if i didn't like it then why would i like it i don't know well it didn't
01:26:36 necessarily ask if you were ashamed to say what do you feel the worst about like feel the worst yes
01:26:40 so like there's other ways like i i'm not ashamed of liking that music i just feel bad
01:26:45 because i like it yeah i know that the person does not like me um i guess i feel bad about
01:26:54 liking generic youtube shit just because it just because it like eats up your time and ruins your
01:27:03 life yeah and also i just feel like i'm not supposed to like it like i don't know sometimes i'll
01:27:09 upload youtube and i'll feel like what like what's the world like what what's it like out there past
01:27:14 past the forest and i'll go on the trending tab and i'll watch maybe one or two videos and i'll
01:27:19 think ha ha yeah okay and then close it and i'll think i should have hated that like like it shouldn't
01:27:26 have been even lukewarm or anything it should have been like i like i actively dislike this
01:27:31 and anything that's trending yeah if i see it and like i shouldn't like this this is horrible this
01:27:37 wouldn't be trending if it were worthwhile yeah hey monkey away asks why are you guys so averse to
01:27:44 talking about big topics you have passionate opinions on it's a lot more entertaining than
01:27:48 Nate's gay ass vacation stories i guess we did briefly touch on well we tried it we tried it today
01:27:55 and it was bad i didn't actually want to talk about capitalism because like yeah i don't like
01:28:02 i don't really admit i am no expert on economics yeah i don't i don't really feel qualified to talk
01:28:08 about it either passionately about have we not talked about well there's always the jq which we
01:28:12 might want to get an answer here you know i didn't know what that was i found out like a week ago
01:28:16 what the hell is jq it's a jewish question what is that oh he doesn't fucking know i don't i don't
01:28:24 i'll check tom's q and a for sure yeah i found myself restraining speaking about things that
01:28:33 interest me basically every single pcp episode i'll have notes and i'll be like wait a second i
01:28:39 forgot none of these people have the same interest in me time to delete half of it why would you
01:28:43 think so like why do you think that like what's the kind of stuff you bring up because like if
01:28:47 it's something like oh like i watched this anime that none of you guys have seen and i wanted to
01:28:53 talk about it like obviously i wouldn't talk about that i don't think there's any it's like that but
01:28:58 for instead of like shows is interest like like what's an interest you have that you don't think
01:29:02 any of us would be interested in talking history history's interesting to everybody it isn't
01:29:08 history i feel like an asshole every single time i i talk about like what what is something
01:29:13 historical that would not be interesting to people i don't know i think a lot of people
01:29:17 will consider it a rather boring school type subject in my mind related to some if you have
01:29:22 like there's a point to be made by history is not boring school is boring i mean i agree from my
01:29:28 perspective if anyone says anything i didn't know it is automatically interesting like yeah no matter
01:29:34 what in taking information i didn't think the thing is more like munchie doesn't know whether
01:29:39 we would make a good conversation piece he doesn't just want to say things that no no i don't i also
01:29:46 don't want you to just bring up history anecdotes with no like particular point behind them exactly
01:29:51 yeah so that's why i don't do it this is i'd be a weird asshole for doing that i mean i mean why
01:29:57 would you want to do that well no i'm saying i want to talk about history and other things not just
01:30:02 that but like why would i do it on the pcp when this is clearly not a good avenue if it's entertaining
01:30:08 and i guess everyone you know i don't bring up stuff i don't think it's entertaining for the
01:30:12 exact same reason and like well that sounds boring and gay so i think it's entertaining to me but in
01:30:16 this context with these people and for this audience no why i mean if you had like let's just
01:30:21 say you read a fucking book and like which i have i can't i don't believe you but like if you did
01:30:26 okay uh and there was like some like you fucking the the you know whatever the fucking fall of
01:30:32 pompeh and like you were like guys just listen to this fucking story about this thing that happened
01:30:36 in real life and then you told it in like a sick way or something like that i don't know maybe that'd
01:30:41 be cool i know i know i know a fact that we all be interjecting and joking and being like hey hey
01:30:48 hey munchy i know i know a fact about pompeh tell me if you heard this one in pompeh it was common
01:30:53 for people to just write on walls yes a lot of graffiti a lot of our enemies would say pom gay
01:30:59 and i was i remember i read i read a thing about like stuff like like archer archer not architects
01:31:05 archeologists they found like that all these messages carved into walls and stuff around the
01:31:09 city including the ironic joke everyone writes on walls but me that's good there's a fuck ton of
01:31:17 sex and pompeh that guy went on to bake homestuck yeah he then he then carved 18,000
01:31:25 hundred words of a story about it's about well it's a story about these four kids they don't
01:31:31 communicate in person they they but they they are friends through their wall star and they
01:31:35 erupt and they all die yeah but but they get transported to a new island yes uh where they
01:31:41 have to play a game to bring the old one back i like to imagine an old romanism just carving away
01:31:45 today's your 13th birthday though it was 13 years ago you were given life as only today you've
01:31:50 been given a name and people just looking on and whore like what the fuck is this guy do imagine
01:31:54 if someone just yeah they just carved like like a story prompt and they went yeah yeah and then they
01:31:59 do like a lot like rp like over like a whole thing and they had like tell like good fun like dnd
01:32:04 campaign or something over like a fucking over the side of like an industrial complex we could just buy
01:32:09 a wall and buy a wall right right we can build a wall yes that wall yes that wall see that's
01:32:19 what we're not all right yeah when that was the high point of this whole episode it was good time
01:32:25 to go out on a high then we have to build the wall we've decided right um we got a lot of people
01:32:33 asking for lectures let people talk about they want more lectures we don't have time we don't have
01:32:38 time i know if you guys want more lectures give us a shitload of money so that we can fly to each
01:32:43 other's place and lecture each other about bullshit so intangible you know i hate making it like i've
01:32:49 always said like hey guys if i make more money i'll finally be able to go to youtube i've always felt
01:32:53 bad about promise that because it's so vague and not concrete i mean it's the way to think about
01:32:59 i mean it is literally true in this case i don't think it's deniable that if we had the money to
01:33:04 group up we would do lectures i mean i would have needed extremely successful yeah yeah like
01:33:10 none of us knew that this was gonna happen far enough ahead of time to prepare i mean i was occupied
01:33:15 with i have i have i have like two and a half lectures maybe ready to go in the chamber but
01:33:20 it really none of them well none of them are like ready to go they all need they'll need research
01:33:24 i only have one and i have to do like extensive research to make it possible i i have can tell
01:33:29 after the show i'll tell you right now it's okay it's about the co-heating cambria album narrative
01:33:34 that sounds great that i would love to hear that i've got buddies who told me about it
01:33:40 tectonic improv's uh uh a top a top the fourth wall linkar is a top the fourth wall is a good
01:33:47 one to tide you over it's good it's it's it's very much like one of ours also there's a bunch of
01:33:52 really funny parts where it seems like the friends the friends that he's conscripted to listen to his
01:33:58 lecture seem really they're mostly okay but every now there's like one like heckler in the crowd
01:34:04 he seems like mad to be there and there's a couple of times where like they have some banter back
01:34:09 and forth and it's not quite sure like is this serious like are they actually mad at each other
01:34:14 are they gonna have words after this oh yeah yeah it's great that narrative compelling i did yeah
01:34:19 good i'll let you watch that um oh you can also watch down the rabbit hole different style but
01:34:27 same kind of content you know i'm thinking i'm thinking monchi wait wait wait about the down the
01:34:33 rabbit hole i mean i have i've mentioned the um the the poos adventures of in the lion king heart
01:34:38 fantasy films that's like a short one i've been thinking about maybe making that into like a down
01:34:42 the rabbit hole style video instead of a lecture because i don't know if there's enough there to
01:34:46 make into a full lecture but even if i do that i still have at least one lecture that i definitely
01:34:51 want to do but down the rabbit hole thing sounds sick yeah yeah yeah that one's been it's it's time
01:34:57 it's time to deliver on that one because the world still doesn't know yeah world still doesn't know
01:35:01 about lion king heart fantasy films there's some intense shit going on now tom are you reading
01:35:07 a question or something i was reading a question to monchi but he's been consumed by pizza tell me

01:36:28 hastily asked guys we need questions right now stumbling out of the gate comes out oh my phone
01:36:33 what's popping shit all right this is the best you could do under such uh high pressure
01:36:41 um all right these are shit uh me cool man asks when will you create your next masterpiece
01:36:48 which i find an interesting question i fucking made a masterpiece yeah if you don't say it
01:36:54 yeah
01:37:00 excellent how do you like go on i feel that my my latest album the world over yeah it's the greatest
01:37:07 masterpiece i've ever created so i am not due to create a masterpiece for the next day i have to
01:37:13 go listen to it day i didn't listen to that one uh uh i'm where did what beats did you use for it
01:37:18 it's entire no it was entirely me rapping over the dot hack sign soundtrack all right and uh i'm
01:37:24 gonna i'll probably make a video explaining the narrative behind it because it's a concept album
01:37:29 let's do and then i think there's some people who will enjoy it even more wait what's it called
01:37:34 the world over didn't you see my video that was like apocalyptic cyberpunk trapped in the internet
01:37:41 anime soundtrack mixtape the world i saw that i didn't click on it
01:37:48 the work on those titles and thumbnails dude it's the i mean i thought that was a perfect title
01:37:53 that's like a title that would make me click on it look the zoomer demographic doesn't agree
01:37:58 clearly i guess so but uh it's it's uh it's by far the most work i've ever put into anything
01:38:04 probably hey so we have the billeted cuppings but this is a provocative question that i like
01:38:09 and it's uh in light of recent events asked mr bones what are your overall thoughts on
01:38:14 monkey as a content creator considering that he was was decided to be too hot for youtube he
01:38:21 could not exist on here yeah i think that i mean i guess i can understand youtube's reasons why i
01:38:31 don't agree with them yeah i don't think he should have had his channel terminated but i guess i if
01:38:36 you if you put a gun to my head i could tell you why they probably did it for pr reasons i
01:38:41 suppose that i don't think it's fair it's like his stuff is like asking about whether you thought
01:38:46 it should get deleted from youtube or just your opinion he's just saying like i mean considering
01:38:50 recent events of him being deleted from youtube like what do you think of him as a content creator
01:38:54 i think he's a hard-ass worker which i respect he is definitely a hard worker but he has always
01:38:58 pushed the line of edginess and like like monkey would say it's jokes which i agree with and i would
01:39:03 100% allow it if i was platform but considering youtube's corporate squeezing of things i i do get
01:39:10 that they think that like like the kind of a little bit of line blurring humor that monkey uses
01:39:17 that it obviously it's not he doesn't fucking endorse elia roger but like when you make lots of
01:39:22 edgy jokes uh i just i get why like you know the normos are not going to be like oh i get it this
01:39:29 is a joke and i don't like elia roger they'll be like like he actually he was literally cited
01:39:34 in in someone's i forget this was like on some news channel or something about how um somebody
01:39:39 please put this in the description somebody's gonna know this or in the comments it was like
01:39:43 somebody made a video about like incels like the rise of the incel threats and like used a clip of
01:39:48 monkey's video about elia roger as like look as like this this is what we're dealing with yeah
01:39:55 where is a literal parody comedy video but the thing is though if you just watch it and you
01:40:00 don't know it's a parody like are you how if you saw like a clip you might think well okay here
01:40:06 we go i mean it's obvious to me but i'm also like steeped in context yeah yeah as a real i'm just
01:40:12 saying the joke got old i've had enough mumpy jones it's time for money james to make money james
01:40:18 money james money james money james money james by the way uh just a small update on this uh you
01:40:25 know how uh sheep over made a channel called jungle jimmy or whatever deleted it was it's not owned
01:40:31 by monkey it was owned by sheep over deleted it's really yeah i mean that's what sheep over just
01:40:36 tweeted uh whatever was called jungle jimmy boy oh they are going hard to yeah they didn't do that to
01:40:43 fucking uh keemstar when he said uh drama alert is run by another person i'm just the hired actor
01:40:48 to be honest but i guess monkey was this is too much this is too much shit i don't i'm surprised i'm
01:40:55 really surprised they don't want them they do not want them uh i guess their minds made i mean
01:41:01 they didn't do that to mike the smoker mike the smoker got his channel back i guess they consider
01:41:06 him less doing tobacco reviews i just don't understand how they have a how this laser focus
01:41:10 i'm joking i just i just think it's funny that mike the smoker is a real thing it's like the the whole
01:41:15 like the the the eye of sauron that is youtube fully did turn its attention like we can all
01:41:21 like we say you know some some shit here that mike had us flagged but like we're under the radar
01:41:26 it feels like the full light of god is shining on monkey in judgment and saying you will not be
01:41:33 here you will be removed for because we want to do that somebody somebody made up their minds
01:41:38 somebody decided yeah yeah it's so weird i mean what do we think about i haven't seen
01:41:43 constantly a while but i used to think he was i don't know i have no reason
01:41:49 yeah i actually said the third the third video those videos are made of you know ellie rodgill
01:41:54 killing video in a while but you know i'm sorry i haven't made another time for one kid it may have
01:41:58 been me who reported his channel i'm just going to make all of those videos and it no i reported

01:42:30 think that i have speed i don't i don't think that i have i have fire too i have many times
01:42:36 because oftentimes i take a piss and then realize afterwards that i have to go back oh well that
01:42:40 counts is i think you're double dipping that part yeah yeah you're double dipping yeah by the way the
01:42:48 worst uh uh question about whatever was from c20l okay that is a is a cuddle to all cuddle to all

01:44:31 yeah he just rants about dug funny literally everywhere there's nothing nothing happens that
01:44:35 i can't relate to dug adventures in bluffington all right here we go so this is juicy shack me
01:44:43 asks uh nate are you creatively past your prime is everything we get from you now on soul dead
01:44:50 and heartless uh sick dick uh that's yes i gotta be a hard yes uh i would the answer is god i hope
01:44:59 not because i've barely done anything uh so if i reach the end i had very little to say from the
01:45:06 start uh no i mean like i said before i feel like everything i do for the rest of my life is kind
01:45:11 of going to be repackaging the same ideas i'm generally talking about on everything but i i would
01:45:17 i guarantee you i'll find cool ways to do those in entertaining ways uh as we go forward i literally
01:45:24 have amazing ideas for content like several times a day way more than i could ever feasibly create
01:45:32 way most of it i end up coming down on the side of like i don't know if i'll ever find time for
01:45:36 this like yeah like over christmas break because i i went to um i went to uh may's parents house and
01:45:44 like just didn't work for like five days and like the whole time we were watching christmas movies
01:45:49 and i had like this really huge idea of like an epic ranking and bass analysis video an idea for
01:45:57 like a how the grinch stole christmas video like reviews of like several other movies it was just
01:46:02 like a diehard like i thought of like a like a whole like a new way i could take on diehard and
01:46:09 explore like why that movie's good and like just all this shit and like one of those around christmas
01:46:14 i have no idea if like if any of these like all of them i know would be successful videos but do i
01:46:22 have the capacity to write them and edit them and give enough of a shit all the way through production
01:46:27 while still working on other things that's the question did you watch it's a wonderful life
01:46:32 this christmas i did not it's a great it's a it's a tradition for me i love that it's great
01:46:36 but i didn't watch a lot of i watched a lot of christmas movies i hadn't seen like i hadn't seen
01:46:41 diehard so it was like i watched for the first time and i was like oh my god it actually is good
01:46:45 it actually is good uh and uh i was really interested in exploring did he diehard because like
01:46:51 other people don't get too far into my my theory yeah okay he was dead from the very start it was a
01:46:56 dream sequence uh to answer this question on me a little bit more from the beginning of best guy
01:47:02 ever i had like four videos planned one of which was the current log and stuff that's done another
01:47:09 of which was the ghost the shell stuff not done and i've got there were two more beyond that that
01:47:15 from the start i planned on making and i've made one of those and i'm working on the second of those
01:47:21 four um i don't know what the fourth one is i only know two and three i'll give you a secret it's not
01:47:26 the best anime ever but quite the opposite that that is true that is true um uh uh yeah i won't
01:47:34 go into any more details i like to surprise people in general but i was gonna say but yeah well it
01:47:39 doesn't matter uh uh when those are done and i will let people know when those are done just
01:47:43 because for trivia sake at that point if you see my content drop off completely because i'm just
01:47:48 like well i fucking said everything i got to say fuck i don't know what i'm gonna do uh fair enough
01:47:52 but until that happens no i'm not bankrupt yet so i've got things to say about stuff uh yes i feel
01:48:00 like i haven't yet shown like my full power in anything you're like it freezes second form right
01:48:08 now you haven't gotten five yeah like i i don't feel it took a while for him to i've i've had like
01:48:13 ideas but i've never really fully embraced any one idea to like make it a proper like properly
01:48:20 create it yeah right so like i yeah i want to see one day it's all up from here one of the things we
01:48:27 should link this in the show notes uh a lot of people haven't seen it but like the animation you
01:48:31 just did for the end of season one of rfck like oh uh s s descent s descent is one of my favorite
01:48:38 things made in recent years by any of us it's on it's on uh the hit not the hypocrite channel it's
01:48:43 on the give and take it's on no no it's on given fortress given fortress given fortress to pay this
01:48:49 is well this is out yes it's been out since like july it came out in like june or july or maybe before
01:48:54 that yeah that would be a concept was so good and i know it's like based on stuff it was based on
01:48:59 like home stuff but it doesn't matter like i loved it so much that every sense there's a lot of
01:49:04 original stuff i yeah absolutely i like man i would love to just see like i don't know give
01:49:08 does like whatever but like brings like this stuff and i'm like man i feel like that would be i feel
01:49:14 like that was the beat that i was seeing a glimpse into unleashing of your full power level and like
01:49:19 i mean maybe it'll never happen maybe you'll just work on big stuff but like god would i love to see
01:49:23 more of that i like the game that you made for escape snakes or yeah run away from snakes run away
01:49:28 from snakes again loved it it was just like came out of nowhere superman's got like leaderboards and
01:49:33 like three miles oh yeah it does have leaderboards that's fucking cool yeah it's fucking dope as
01:49:38 shit uh so yeah i don't know like i said there's all these things around like to to imagine them
01:49:44 perhaps in one way coalesce until i don't know maybe like a webcomic that has like this i mean
01:49:49 that's what it is it's part of a webcomic um hey would be super cool i'm gonna give a signal
01:49:54 boost on unrockly the given fortress two for a video that my friend ethan editor of armor
01:49:59 table edited oh yeah it was a live stream that we did and video is epic and it has like 300 views
01:50:05 and it's great yeah you know i've never seen it wait i don't even know if i know about given fortress
01:50:09 two that's not given because there's given gaming yeah given given fortress two was like my my my naive
01:50:15 attempt after like marathoning like all of german 985 and star underscores videos on tf2 like all of
01:50:21 them um i just wanted to be one of them so i like started a tf2 gaming channel where i was going to
01:50:28 be like a cool guy but now there's other stuff but like i i i don't think i'm well it just becomes
01:50:35 like a shit rump channel after he abandoned it for so long and then it just became funny like
01:50:38 i have this channel i never use what if i put the ufo things on there yeah um so like it's secret i
01:50:44 mean yeah there was that one time we were setting up the the stream for right on three and i streamed
01:50:50 the stream on there yeah oh yeah right yeah yeah i do remember that i think i had just thought that
01:50:56 it was the same thing as given gaming when i heard you say that i'm not surprised i uh does anyone
01:51:02 else i love to when i'm testing a stream i use the bestgaver live streams channel because it's
01:51:07 got like 800 subs and those are the those are the true heroes those are the the deep deep shit people
01:51:14 they're the deep shit uh and they know what's up they know the secret jokes and me
01:51:21 uh pretty sick it is pretty sick i think gaming or fck something that had it's gone it's gone
01:51:29 uh there's something the question was about uh full potential oh yeah are you creatively
01:51:35 bankrupt yeah are you creatively bankrupt god no no i can listen i mean go look at endless war endless
01:51:40 war has only endless war has only just scratched the surface of the kind of the at the the like the
01:51:46 depths of totally totally pointless but like but totally richly engaging like total clusterfuck
