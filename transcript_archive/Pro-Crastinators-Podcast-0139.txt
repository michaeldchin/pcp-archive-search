00:00:00 Listen, listen, I'm not out there every day, you know, put on my heart,
00:00:30 hard hat, I'm not out there, you know, getting a jack hammer to the roadside to install
00:00:35 some more plumbing. I'm just out there rubbing lotion on old people, rubbing lotion on dead
00:00:40 people, just trying to get them all lubed up for the afterlife, you know what I'm trying
00:00:44 to say? God, you know, you know when you're a kid and you don't know better and you don't
00:00:52 know what's rude, and you have a grandma, and you just want to touch her flabby little
00:00:56 elbows and her arms and her forearm, you just want to fucking get your all grubby hands
00:01:00 all up in there with some lotion. Well, you know, she's got flabby skin, you know, she's
00:01:07 got skin hanging off her and you just want to go rub all around. Why? Why? Alright, alright,
00:01:20 guys, here's the intro. Guys, I've been working on an intro, I've been waiting for the day
00:01:25 when Nate would finally leave us alone for once, and I've got the intro. Here, let me
00:01:32 know what you think. I hope you're recording all this. Oh, oh, oh, I am. Slippity slap,
00:01:37 put on a hat. Slippity slap, put on a hat. It's time for an episode of the PCP, guys.
00:01:43 Wow. I'm so upset, I'm such a virgin, no one will have sex with me, you know, I'm going
00:01:50 to die alone, I'm so upset about it, and I think I might just have to resort to some
00:01:56 sort of outward acts of violence. What do you guys think? Do you guys think that I should
00:02:01 do something brash and reckless due to the fact that I have so much inward self-loving
00:02:06 based on my fact that I'm a virgin? Talking about weapons of mass destruction? No, I'm
00:02:11 talking about like AK-47s, I'm talking about like tech nines. I think we didn't sync our
00:02:16 audios yet. We didn't, we can do another show. Yeah, like we said, like we were just talking,
00:02:23 we're bringing the A content today, like syncing the audio on the show. Alright, on the count
00:02:27 of three, let's say good podcast. One, two, three, good podcast. Okay, let's just say
00:02:34 good next time. One, two, three, good. I want you to know that I made air quotes around
00:02:40 a good podcast. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, listen. Hello everybody and welcome to the
00:02:47 Procrastinator's podcast, none of that is in the podcast, this is the podcast now. I
00:02:50 hope not. No, why? Because look, how does it look? Okay, we all know that we're having
00:02:58 a good time, we're having a great time and we want to bring it to the people, but you
00:03:01 know, you know that Nate comes, but Nate listens to the episode, and what's his takeaway? Oh
00:03:06 yeah, right. These guys can't run a podcast without me. Oh, without me, it just descends
00:03:11 into chaos, unprofessionalism, and we can't, we can't have him tighten his iron grip any
00:03:18 further, will strangle us. The hallmark, the poster child of sheer madness and chaos is
00:03:26 us doing a cold open laughing. That's what you can easily use no hand wave away, that's
00:03:33 pure unorganization. He'll hear that and he'll take off his headset and he'll put it down
00:03:39 and he'll look out the window sadly and he'll shake his head and he'll say things have really
00:03:43 gone downhill around here. The ideal PCP intro for Nate is all this like solemn in change
00:03:51 wearing, you know, prison jumpsuits, looking down on your keyboard, not even looking up
00:03:55 at the audacity recording, and him just blathering away for 35 minutes while we just whimper out
00:04:01 affirmative yeses and mm-hmms. I think we should start with a liturgy. I think we should
00:04:07 start with prayers. Oh yes, yeah. Well, let's start with like saying who's on the podcast,
00:04:13 and then we can start by starting about the, we can start, I'm, hello, it's me, Hippocrite.
00:04:17 Oh, they know us. I'm ready, yeah. There's Mage, there's Tom, there's Ben, there's Munchy,
00:04:23 and there's also a secret guest. No, don't tell them about me. You know what's going
00:04:29 on? Is every time Nate's away, we destroy the podcast and make a fool of our own self.
00:04:33 I don't want to make a fool of myself. I want to, whoa.
00:04:36 Look, let's dismantle more PCP's. We want to make Nate feel like shit, and the only
00:04:40 way to make him feel like shit is to make him feel smugly superior. It's going to feel
00:04:45 smugly superior. He's going to be secondhand embarrassed for associating with such degenerates.
00:04:51 Guys, guys, you're talking about him? He already won.
00:04:54 No.
00:04:55 Oh gosh.
00:04:56 That's true.
00:04:57 Welcome to the Procrastinate's Podcast, everybody. This is the new Procrastinate's Podcast.
00:05:03 Merry Christmas. This is the beginning of the episode, and nothing has been in the previous.
00:05:08 We sure have been talking for two hours prior to this recording.
00:05:10 We haven't been talking at all about no one in particular. It's me, Hippocrite. Today,
00:05:15 we have with us, Mage.
00:05:17 I am alive.
00:05:20 We have Tom Oliver.
00:05:21 And we have Hippo.
00:05:22 We did it. We did it, guys. We did it. We did it without he who shone off me name.
00:05:28 Hey, it's me, Munchy, doing also the Procrastinate's Podcast intro while Hippo's doing it. Next,
00:05:33 we have Hippo.
00:05:34 Next, we have Ben St. Hi.
00:05:35 Hi, I'm Hippo.
00:05:36 Next, we have Ben St.
00:05:37 Even when he's not here.
00:05:39 Next, we have Mage.
00:05:40 We're wrapped up. He's our abusive boyfriend. He leaves his mark on us.
00:05:48 Dude, I have the ultimate in shitty podcast audio quality right in front of me. I ordered
00:05:57 food, and it came just before we started to record, and I'm hungry, so I'm going to take
00:06:00 a big old bite of this chicken burger.
00:06:02 Oh.
00:06:03 All right, get ready.
00:06:04 Chicken burger.
00:06:05 I'm going to eat through the entirety of the podcast to make it really bad.
00:06:12 We already did that. That was a bonus episode.
00:06:15 Remember everyone's favorite bonus episode, talking while eating?
00:06:19 Can you believe this terrible thing that Hippo did? Wouldn't it be so funny if I would
00:06:24 do this thing in the entire podcast? We already have done that and charged for it.
00:06:29 This is a teaser trailer. Go to the bonus PCP to see that for real.
00:06:33 Wait, Hippo, you got to say the line. We remember we used to advertise the bonus episodes,
00:06:39 and you would be the one to make the trailer for it.
00:06:44 You know, talking with your mouth full every single time.
00:06:47 Hey, you know what I want to talk about? I want to talk about how this is not well-munchy.
00:06:52 It's so cool that you fucking hate the PCP, even though it's not even true, but it's easy
00:06:56 for people to take that away, even though that's not what I mean ever.
00:06:58 We all hate the PCP, man, but not real.
00:07:01 It's cool.
00:07:02 I want to talk about how the PCP's views are stagnant and how I want everyone to not have
00:07:08 that happen anymore. So let's discuss how it's the fans fault for that.
00:07:14 Okay. If we do that, we'll drive away, we'll drive away, if our views are stagnant, it
00:07:21 just means that we've got our dedicated fan base.
00:07:24 Right, we have our cult.
00:07:26 Yeah, we're not gaining new ones, but we've got the old ones that are on lock. We've given
00:07:32 them Stockholm Syndrome, and now they can't escape. We've got the sunk cost fallacy, and
00:07:37 now they've invested too much time listening to us, and now it would be a waste to stop.
00:07:43 You know, I'm not trying to gain YouTube here, I'm not trying to get the PCP to launch
00:07:48 into PewDiePie, Tobuscus level. I just like seeing numbers go up, that's my one and only
00:07:53 goal here.
00:07:54 Literally, why are you talking like you're up at four in the morning looking at pornography
00:08:00 on your 1998 AOL internet connection, and you don't want your parents to wake up?
00:08:09 Listen, some people, they jack it to Fuda, some people jack it to Femdom, I jack it to
00:08:14 the Procrastinaires podcast.
00:08:16 Oh, every time?
00:08:17 Every single time, yeah.
00:08:20 Alright, unironically, the PCP to me feels like the niche content that is like lesser
00:08:29 than all of the small other projects that we do. Like the PCP is the offshoot from the
00:08:36 podcast, I Am Games, and like everything. Like it feels like this is the least viewed
00:08:41 out of all of the smaller projects that we do.
00:08:43 I don't even think it's true though.
00:08:45 It's not the least viewed, but I know what you mean. Like, Tom, I think when we were
00:08:52 talking about this, you brought this up, and I wholeheartedly agree that the PCP is not
00:08:57 really an enterprise in and of itself. It's sort of a well or a cistern, or like a sewer,
00:09:05 if you will, like a sewage drainage pipe where like our other projects will garner attention,
00:09:14 and then people that are interested in that will follow us down the drain and end up here.
00:09:18 Yeah, this is like the end of the funnel. Except the end of the funnel is usually how
00:09:23 you get the money, so.
00:09:25 But okay, but consider this, we did have smaller numbers before, and then we got big numbers,
00:09:31 and then those big numbers turned into normal numbers, and now we have those now. Do you
00:09:35 think that that's purely just from people finding our individual content? Because there
00:09:40 were a lot of people back in late A, saying like, oh, I'm a big PCP fan. Dude, I showed
00:09:45 my friends the PCP, and they were like, holy shit, I didn't know people could be this funny.
00:09:50 And then they turned three years old the next year, and they stopped watching. But the point
00:09:56 is, is that people used to watch the show, like, not independently from our own stuff,
00:10:03 but they thought it was like, you know, the main content. And who thinks the main content
00:10:08 is the PCP anymore?
00:10:10 Let me pause it an actual theory about this. I think I might have the answer. Like, these
00:10:19 days, what are we all doing these days? Like, we're doing, like, I'm chugging away on vapors,
00:10:26 which I want to talk about that in a minute. But like, you know, mostly lately we've been
00:10:31 working on Endless War, which is so niche. You know, like, Hippo, you've stopped making
00:10:35 like, mainstream YouTube stuff. Tom, you've pretty much, you've stopped making YouTube
00:10:39 stuff and you're working on a Zoomy game now. Maid, you've been dead for a while. I think,
00:10:47 I think maybe back in the day, when we were growing, it was when we were doing like, you
00:10:53 know, mainstream consumable products, you know, like Hippo was making Hippocrite video
00:11:00 game reviews and stuff. Tom was doing like tech reviews, you know?
00:11:04 True. I don't know, though, because like...
00:11:07 Just for the record, I am working on something, but it might not come into fruition anytime
00:11:12 soon, so I'd like to keep it for the most part a secret, but I'm not just sitting on
00:11:17 my hands for the most part. Don't worry.
00:11:20 Maid, you've never heard of a thing that takes a while to do.
00:11:23 Maid, you gotta follow Maid on Twitter for those amazing androgynous, confused characters.
00:11:34 Boys who don't know what a boy is. Yeah, they're going to be...
00:11:37 Excuse you.
00:11:38 I don't know, because like, we weren't like, super big in those fields. Do you think it's
00:11:48 the idea that we were making stuff, like, created an environment where it seems like
00:11:55 we're cool, and now we're not cool because they don't see stuff?
00:11:59 Well, all I was suggesting was just that, you know, we as a collective were getting
00:12:06 more views through that more mainstream digestible content. However, I think there's something
00:12:11 to be said, yeah, for the perception that, you know, we are all YouTubers, which was
00:12:16 never really true, but it was maybe truer at some point in the past than it is now,
00:12:22 that we were all YouTubers, and we were all embarking on this YouTube adventure together,
00:12:27 you know? We were like a guild of some kind on this unified quest, and like, we've all
00:12:34 diversified our shit, and like, we've all gone in all these crazy fucking individual
00:12:38 directions now, and it's maybe a little less like that.
00:12:41 I thought of a counterpoint that scares me. Yeah.
00:12:44 I was going to say, sure, we were making more mainstream content.
00:12:48 I hate quiet munchies so much.
00:12:50 Raise your fucking voice.
00:12:52 Listen, I'm in a high-rise apartment in downtown Boston. I'm making Mad Bank. I'm the vice
00:12:58 president of TripAdvisor, and I don't need this sort of this rabble rousing and all these
00:13:05 screams and these maims coming from you lower class. I'm just trying here to make a quick
00:13:11 buck.
00:13:11 Why don't you get Munchie off? Let's get the rowdy fucker on here instead.
00:13:15 Oh, I hate that guy.
00:13:17 Me too, man.
00:13:18 I thought for a moment, like, you know, oh, sure, we were making more mainstream stuff
00:13:24 before, but you know, people like niche stuff. People surely like our stuff now, because it's
00:13:30 more interesting. But then I thought for a second, maybe they don't. Maybe they don't want to get
00:13:37 you dumb, dumb, because a lot of people don't like it.
00:13:41 Well, sure. But I'm saying, you know, you would think that maybe your core audience would appreciate
00:13:45 what you're doing now, but I would think there's probably a lot of, like, for instance,
00:13:50 hippo fans who don't really, maybe not dislike his comics, but don't really like, oh, he's not
00:13:55 doing game reviews. Okay, bye. Sure, yeah, with Munchie fans who are like, oh, you know, I don't
00:14:00 like, you know, he's not doing an arm retrieval or, you know, whatever. I mean, think about it,
00:14:05 like, go way, way back. Like, the foundation of the PCP was the horseshoe crew, and everyone,
00:14:11 it was all YouTube. Like, everyone, you know, everyone who found us in the horseshoe days found
00:14:16 us through YouTube, maybe not everyone, but almost everyone, you know, everyone that found us once
00:14:20 the PCP became a thing, you know, in the postponement, they all found us through the PCP on YouTube.
00:14:25 Like, most of us were on YouTube making YouTube stuff, you know, people have found me through the
00:14:29 the Sonichu lecture, and come come here through that, and that's YouTube. So, you know, and it's
00:14:38 I mean, it makes sense. It's obvious when you lay down like that, but it's just kind of, I don't know,
00:14:42 startling in a way to think, to maybe some people, we've just completely abandoned what made us good,
00:14:49 and we're going to be the stars of YouTube videos, I mean, like, like, how how they lost their spark,
00:14:53 or, you know, like, fall straight. Yeah, yeah. Like, like, Ben St. Stop doing My Little Pony
00:14:58 Reviews, and he became a pokey tuber. Like, that is just great. It's scary. It's scary and a little,
00:15:02 almost like, nauseating. Not not in the sense that like, oh, you make me sick, but it's just kind
00:15:07 of like a sickening thought. Like, yeah, there's probably a lot of people, maybe, you know, people
00:15:13 that have like seen my, say, the Sonichu video, and think that that's what I'm about. And like,
00:15:19 the fact that I'm not doing that means that to them, I'm effectively dead. It's like, I've effectively
00:15:25 quit doing anything as far as they're concerned. I really, I really dislike, like, I don't mind
00:15:31 the fact that people do that, but like, it annoys me, just conceptually. This idea that on the
00:15:36 internet, it's, it's like, if you're not creating a constant stream of something, if you're not
00:15:42 maintaining a presence, then people immediately forget about you. And you'd need to be like,
00:15:48 the best of the best of all time for people to actually care. And even then, they'll just get
00:15:53 mad that you're not uploading frequently enough. Well, I understand, because if like, you know,
00:15:58 I'm watching a YouTube creator or YouTube channel, and he's making one type of content,
00:16:02 I'm going to subscribe to him because I like that content. And if he totally shifts gears,
00:16:06 it's not that I'm thinking, oh, this guy is terrible. This guy's lost all his creative
00:16:10 inspiration. She's like, well, I didn't sign up for this. I hate having the mentality applied
00:16:18 to me, but I absolutely apply it to everyone else. I'm just as guilty of this as anybody else.
00:16:23 And it's interesting. Well, I don't expect the people to suddenly like my comics. I expect that
00:16:28 to be a completely different thing. I just, when it was like what I was doing, if you stay away from
00:16:35 the internet for even a week, people are like, what the fuck? And I'm like, shut up. You don't
00:16:40 know how long it takes to do anything. Yeah. Right. Right. Well, I mean, how could they?
00:16:44 A little kid, John Tron made like a post like back on normal booths like way a long time ago,
00:16:51 talking about his like upload schedule. We can't talk about John Tron anymore.
00:16:55 I heard he said some bad things. When PewDiePie way back on normal booth, oh,
00:17:00 wait, shit, went to a buskets, oh, wait, shit, when, um, when, um, when Harvey Weinstein,
00:17:08 oh, wait, shit, non-descript internet YouTuber celebrity. Yeah.
00:17:15 He was discussing his upload schedule and he was talking about how like, yeah, I'm sorry,
00:17:19 guys, like I fucked up. I shouldn't have said I would have a bi-weekly schedule. It's, you know,
00:17:23 that's bi-weekly. Yeah, bi-weekly schedule. It's way too short of time to make a good video. And
00:17:29 I'm like, bi-weekly, I can, that's like two weeks, dude. You could do anything in two weeks.
00:17:36 That's what you're talking about. This just makes me think of, uh, like, like the new T-Bap,
00:17:41 like Tom, you said it, like the, like the old T-Baps, we made them in a weekend. We, we rushed
00:17:46 them out. We had deadlines and we stuck to them religiously. The new one has no hard deadline.
00:17:52 And for that reason, it's taken us like, like for the better part of a year. I mean, we haven't,
00:17:56 we weren't working on it for a long time after, right, but you know, it's been a long fucking time.
00:18:01 And it's like shit, man. We, we all need, we all need the deadlines of a weekly children's
00:18:07 cartoon to whip us all back into shape, I think is what we're getting to here. There's definitely
00:18:12 something to be said about a deadline. Please, please, please rescue yourself from my scorn.
00:18:17 Surely this P-Bap is more intensive. Well, I mean, obviously. Yeah, okay. But however, you know,
00:18:24 counter to that. I somehow doubt that like, it will be, you know, a more of a hit. Like, I don't,
00:18:32 like, even though more work has gone, like this, this, this T-Bap is not going to get like, you
00:18:37 know, insane views or anything proportional to the amount of work that was put into it. Not,
00:18:41 not even, not by a long shot. I mean, that's just because you dropped off the map of pony reviews
00:18:49 and people wouldn't be expecting it, except the small amount of people who that played
00:18:53 the Frog Frashions fans. I imagine if it does blow up and all the Pony people are just like,
00:18:57 oh my god, these guys are great. I wish they were T-Baps back and Phantomore can finally make his big
00:19:02 cameo revisit on analysis anarchy. Oh, no. Do we have to go back? Do we say something, mage?
00:19:11 Yeah, I wouldn't, because I feel like there will not be a good time to remind you this,
00:19:17 because we'll always be talking about something. You are going to put me on blast and I'm just,
00:19:21 I'm really scared and I want to get that band-aid off. Don't, we don't have to do that right now.
00:19:27 We don't have to, I have written down here. I will, I will, stop hurting me. I will get to it.
00:19:33 All right, mage. Stop hurting me and hurt me already. I'll tell you how you broke, I'll tell
00:19:37 you how you broke my heart. Oh no. Yeah. I was in, we were in, you know, we were in, I was in
00:19:44 New Los Angeles City for Slimer Nailia, right? The, the, the, the week of Slimer Nailia.
00:19:51 And who do I see? Who do I see in the RFCK Discord, but none other than mage,
00:19:57 Uwu. And I get so happy, I'm so happy. I'm like, mage finally joined the Discord.
00:20:03 She finally took my advice, joined the Discord and listed killers, became purple, like, like,
00:20:09 it was always her destiny. And then I see that, no, it's just a troll. It's just Shawnee. It's
00:20:16 just Shawnee, that wily trickster god putting on one of his many hats, one of his many disguises.
00:20:23 And I was crestfallen, crestfallen, mage. So, so, so that's what I didn't do.
00:20:31 That's right. That's right. And now I'm putting you on blast for it.
00:20:36 Well, I, I don't understand. I'm not sure if I should be apologizing.
00:20:42 I guarantee you should. If, if only you had joined the, the thing already,
00:20:49 then there would be no confusion. I, I made it clear I have no interest
00:20:53 in fighting people over slime things. You can farm. You can farm.
00:20:56 She's already lifted in real life, Ben. A Discord server just doesn't satisfy the urge for mage
00:21:01 anymore. Instead of slime, mage, you should join my server, the, the mud puddle, and become a mud,
00:21:08 mud knight. No, no, no, no, no, there's no fighting. There's no fighting. The mud puddle is all about
00:21:14 just wallowing in, in, in the swamps and doing nothing on Discord. Mage needs to start her own
00:21:20 purple server where everybody fights with Pokemon skeletons. You gotta, you gotta start a gang that
00:21:25 just fights with the bones of Pokemon that you dig up. The, the, the, the violent violets,
00:21:30 they'll be the gang. Oh shit, yeah. Here's, like the other day, because like last PCP we talked about,
00:21:38 the Discord's going to war. I riled up my boys and, and I created some lore for my server,
00:21:44 the mud puddle. And then we're like, we're like the Abyss. We're like the, the, the downtrodden,
00:21:50 like, dregs of human society covered in filth and muck, swallowing in the dirt. And we're here to
00:21:56 drag you all down and drown you and make you into a, into a bunch of gross shit. And that's us,
00:22:03 and that's what we're here to do. And you have to be a mudblood. You can't be like special or
00:22:07 anything. You have to be a freaking loser. And mud is better than slime and mud cannot be defeated
00:22:13 by slime because mud is endless. And it's a lot of it. And I like, I want every Discord in the
00:22:19 world to have like a cool lore and fighting style, not, not necessarily because we're going to make
00:22:25 every server a bot server where you can do stuff, but just as like a cool aesthetic thing. So you
00:22:31 can wave your flag. My server has some of that, has some like some, some vague role lore going on,
00:22:37 but it could be codified. It could be codified a lot better. We've got the rank and file soldiers
00:22:43 of the Wastoid's in Ben Stelfire. Are like Protestant Christians and Catholic Christians,
00:22:49 where, you know, we can fight a lot, you know, we can have some hard times, the rising killers
00:22:52 can kill each other mercilessly in the street over and over ad nauseam forever. But then we just,
00:22:57 we look a little bit to the, to the east and we see some Muslims and we just, like we just
00:23:02 on cue both simultaneously. And we just, we can't have that. No, sorry. Yeah, no, no, you know,
00:23:07 we may hate each other, but you know, we hate other people even more. So we have to kill them.
00:23:11 We have to team up to be able to destroy them. It's game of, it's game of Discord communities.
00:23:16 We like, we will, killers and rowdies will come together to protect their fair city from a mutual
00:23:21 threat. Disgusting though. What happens when the hippos invade? What happens when the mud envelops
00:23:27 in the swamp? Talk about niche content. What the fuck are we talking about right now?
00:23:32 This is the real shit. This is the raw shit. This is what we care about deeply. We want to,
00:23:37 viewer, listen, we invite you to join us on this quest of inner beauty and self-discovery.
00:23:43 You know, we invite, invite, we're inviting you into our world, into our private world
00:23:48 of, of whatever the fuck we're talking about right now. Come along. Come along. It's just,
00:23:53 it's just way more interesting. Like YouTube, I see like is 100% explanations about something or
00:24:00 other. And I'm like, I don't want to explain. I want to create. That's why I like all this Discord
00:24:05 shit because it's, it's very creative and it's very silly. And it's very on the fly. And it's like,
00:24:10 you're interacting with people. It's like having a comment section, but like a real time comment
00:24:14 section, but you don't even have to stream to do it. You just talk to people live. It's great.
00:24:21 Was it, was it, you always talking to Munchie about how like Discord has changed how, how people
00:24:26 like talk to each other on the internet? It was me who told that to you. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well,
00:24:32 it was a conversation we were having. You and I. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. We're partners in this,
00:24:37 I guess. Whatever. It was, whatever. I was in, well, if it wasn't you, then I was going to bring
00:24:43 it as my own idea, but whatever. Yeah. It's interesting. I never thought about it before.
00:24:50 Like I had, I mean, has everyone on the internet migrated to Discord? Has everyone given up on
00:24:55 Skype? I'm super big. My original point was back in like Skype and stuff like that.
00:25:02 You know, you had group chats, but you had to be friend, someone in order to get into those chats.
00:25:08 And there were more like friend groups. There were some like big, you know, 100 people groups,
00:25:13 but those were few and far in between. And again, you had to be friend, so maybe an admin or a
00:25:18 member or something like that to even get into them. With Discord, it shifted away from like
00:25:22 friend groups to like capital S servers that are borderline independent communities and
00:25:29 completely communities, completely revolving around one aspect, you know, maybe a game or
00:25:33 a show or something like that, or even just, you know, common interests or, you know,
00:25:37 something niche like endless war. But the point is that they aren't friend groups per se. They can
00:25:41 become friend groups. And sometimes they are friend groups. I have some, you know, IRL friend
00:25:47 group Discord servers, but most of the time they are like independent communities. Yeah, that you
00:25:52 join and you can partake in, you know, in whatever you want. They're like forms interpersonal
00:25:58 connections. They're like, yeah, they're sort of like forms. They just move super fucking fast.
00:26:03 Exactly. It's weird. It's very strange. It's a very strange world we live in now.
00:26:10 I don't know. I don't know what's so strange about it. It's just sort of chatting with,
00:26:13 it's a way to communicate with like a large amount of people very easily.
00:26:20 It's not that easy, though, because like, it does kind of feel like Discord servers and things
00:26:25 like that have replaced internet forums to a certain extent, but it's a totally different
00:26:29 experience. It doesn't feel the same at all. Because a Discord server goes by and like,
00:26:34 you pretty much have to be there, or you miss it. Whereas like a forum, it's like people are
00:26:39 posting and it's all archived and you read through the backlog. I don't really read through
00:26:43 backlogs on Discord very much because there's just too fucking much. And it shows Ben. It shows.
00:26:48 What do you? What do you? Yeah, I do. I do all the time. Who's got fucking time for that?
00:26:56 Who's got time for any of you freaks? Yeah, true. Apparently you do, since you're here.
00:27:03 I'm only here for that moolah, baby. Destroyed. I'm only here for that cassola.
00:27:08 Why does everyone sound like dead and or dying physically and or mentally? Well, you're talking
00:27:13 quiet. I thought I always sounded dead or down. Let me tell you a story, Hifo. I went to Canada.
00:27:19 I returned from Canada and then I got ill and almost died and my fever was very high.
00:27:25 What a story. What a cool story, dude. Why were you in Canada? Just another day in the life of
00:27:29 the violent violence. Was this on a podcast that I wasn't on? Did I miss the story of why you were
00:27:34 in Canada? No, that's the thing though. Like, I haven't been in an apartment. Like, this is my
00:27:39 first podcast after I've returned from Canada. Yeah, Mage has been gone for a while. Mage was
00:27:45 in my time zone and didn't even say hi to me. Discussing. Making a mistake, viewers. I'm not
00:27:51 bored or uninterested or sleepy. I just am quiet today. You're getting quiet much. It feels like
00:27:56 there's a different person. Yeah, it does feel, you know, like I'd seen in Men in Black. It feels
00:28:00 uncanny. Where the bug just like wears the guy's skin. I feel like that's happening with you right
00:28:05 now. I think, I don't know if it was you, Tom, who described this to me, but I think it was at
00:28:10 your house, at DigiHouse last trip to Boston, where I was just talking, I don't know, pretty
00:28:16 seriously about college or something. Or maybe it was on an episode and everyone was aghast.
00:28:20 Everyone didn't know how to react to me. That happened on like six different episodes.
00:28:25 No one just can't. Everyone just can't. It's still doesn't sink in though.
00:28:31 Yeah. It will never sink in. Hey, hey, did we, did it, is it, is it kosher if I bring up the whole
00:28:37 Vic thing? Because people told me, people told me that Vic like criticized me on the college thing,
00:28:44 but I listened to what he said. And like, it was so, it didn't even feel like criticism. I don't
00:28:50 know. People, people told me like, man, Vic put the PCP on blast. And like, I was, he was pretty
00:28:55 anti-Ben with it. And I listened to it. And he's like, it's totally not. He disagrees with us not,
00:29:02 like, you know, with us, like discouraging college and stuff, you know,
00:29:07 I'm so mutual on that, by the way. I, you know, I mean, I don't know. I've thought about it in my,
00:29:13 my position. Like, I was never like totally against. I'm just, you know, hesitant. I'm
00:29:20 hesitant and, and, and concerned about the merits of it. But I'm not like totally, I don't know.
00:29:28 I guess I just wanted to say that people told me some people, people hyped that up like it was a
00:29:33 big dramatic thing. And then I listened to it and it wasn't, you know, just like everything else in
00:29:39 life. That I have not seen any of those videos besides hippos. And I assume due to the fact that
00:29:49 they're the college topic that are all revolving around me. And it's more fucking noise on that
00:29:54 front, which I don't really care for the other way to hear more affirmation or, or negativity.
00:29:59 Yeah. Doesn't really, I don't need that. So I've seen that, that they can help you to come out.
00:30:04 Then I've seen Digi's rebuttal. And I thought no fucking thanks. I didn't see Digi's rebuttal.
00:30:10 Digi's video was just a apology, general. Okay. I saw hippo's video. And his description is like,
00:30:18 he really replies to Digi and his description events sound so strange that I had no, I have no idea
00:30:24 what I had stumbled onto. It was so different than what I had thought. So how often do gangsters come
00:30:31 up in the discussion? It was, it was just once. It was, they were, they were talking. That was,
00:30:36 that was the dumbest thing by far. Well, but, but hippo, you agreed with it. You like, you were
00:30:44 like defending the argument. I was, I was defending, which again, I didn't hear his original argument,
00:30:48 but I heard your rebuttal to it. The basic gist was they were talking about college and
00:30:54 what a college degree can get you. And it like is a good reason for college. The doctors were
00:31:00 brought up, lawyers were brought up. And then Digi brought up like illegal doctors could only go
00:31:06 into the gangsters. And like Mae was like, what the fuck are you talking about? And Digi had been
00:31:11 like smoking weed like during the episode. And it was very funny. But I thought he had a point
00:31:15 and he was getting shut down because he was smoking weed. And I decided to defend him.
00:31:19 PCP or is this on? No, this was on Digi and Mae Pokemon Colosseum. Let's play.
00:31:24 Right, right, right. Okay, okay. Well, I, well, I, we probably don't need to go any further into
00:31:31 all that. You know, there's already like a, there's already a constellation of minor
00:31:36 videos, reaction videos about it. I just want to, I just, I just want to know if there's anything
00:31:42 I'm missing out. Is there any sort of like a knowledge bomb that Victor or did you have dropped
00:31:46 that changed the conversation? Digi, Vicks is very, Vicks is very pro college and thinks college
00:31:51 is a good idea. I mean, did the only thing that was definitely there are arguments for that.
00:31:56 Victor's video was that like college can be good. And he goes on to basically say that like,
00:32:03 the PCP in general is kind of on the downswing. And like, we're not doing enough. And a lot of
00:32:09 like, like no one would want our lives lifestyle is basically what the gist was.
00:32:14 In so many words.
00:32:16 Well, I mean, the statement college can be good is the most
00:32:21 That's pretty uncontroversial.
00:32:23 Right. I guess the only thing, because like, Digi made a response video and he tried not to
00:32:29 include Munchy in it at all, because it was just supposed to be his thesis on college,
00:32:33 which is just everything we've already heard, but said for everyone can hear it now,
00:32:37 not in his own house when it was like Halloween or whatever.
00:32:39 And he was just, you know, just went over the same fucking points, whatever.
00:32:46 Okay, but there were some things that Victor said in his video that like,
00:32:50 weren't 100% accurate to like what we've been saying and stuff, I guess, and she was trying
00:32:55 to clarify that. I don't mean the reason the Victor thing was a big deal is because he went
00:32:59 into all of us for like, not producing content. And the fact that some of us that was saying
00:33:05 college is bad. And like, you're not successful. So how can you say that you idiot?
00:33:09 And it was like a bit like, incendiary. I thought it was funny, because like Victor is
00:33:14 too chuckly to seem like an actual dangerous man. Like if he had a knife, he'd be laughing,
00:33:20 I'd be laughing along with him. So like, it was, you know, it was just a little,
00:33:26 like slight drama bump, like brony style drama. It's not even actually a thing.
00:33:31 It's not, yeah, it's not, if you watch a video, like, at first I was like, I don't know, like the
00:33:38 only thing that felt weird is that it's some of the stuff Victor had say at the time felt like he
00:33:43 was just like, because I haven't talked to him since Radcon. So it was like, between Radcon and
00:33:48 now, did he suddenly like get on a different wavelength or something? But it was fine. It was
00:33:53 not a big deal. It's not even worth talking about right now. That's how unimportant it is.
00:33:58 It's so hard to keep up tabs with Victor. Granted, I haven't tried that hard. I mean,
00:34:05 I guess if I wanted to do that, I would be watching the, you know,
00:34:09 Vic and Hope, the Vic and Hope channel, but I haven't been watching any, any such like,
00:34:14 Let's Play videos. I've recently outlawed Let's Plays for my life. I've made a restriction
00:34:19 where I can no longer watch them as a mental health. Yeah, I jumped back into them. I like Vic
00:34:25 and Hope. I don't watch it because it's breath in the wild and it sucks to look at. But yeah,
00:34:31 and the Digi and Main stuff. I like a bit of Let's Play talking about shit,
00:34:37 because it is kind of like, it's a weird format because they're friends and they know you.
00:34:44 And when they talk about you, it's kind of like you're listening in on a conversation,
00:34:48 but they're making it public. It's such a weird, you would never get that in a formal podcast,
00:34:56 necessarily. It feels more like a conversation that you, you, you just have like the key to, to,
00:35:03 to snoop around in the back and listen to them. I'm actually going to rescind. I'm going to rescind
00:35:09 my last statement that it's so hard to keep up with the Victor. It's actually, I assume,
00:35:14 I assume it wouldn't be that hard if I tried at all. 100% my fault. I used to fucking watch a Digi
00:35:21 bro every single day it came out. I was the most religious team Victor fan of all time. Victor's
00:35:27 my spicy bro. Victor is an official spicy bro. But what have I done to keep him tabs with them?
00:35:33 I haven't fucking messaged him and probably literally a year, if not more. I have not been
00:35:41 listening to his podcast. I've not even been attempting to keep up with him. I've just assumed,
00:35:46 you know, haha, he's not on discord or at least I don't think he's in the server,
00:35:50 right now. No, no, I, I know he has a discord account, but I think he made one specifically to
00:35:56 join the, the PCP discord, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm, that's probably true. Yeah, I don't think
00:36:01 that he's on it. He's, he's notoriously like not on the net. Yeah. So I think if I were to text him
00:36:08 or something, it would be a gale of time, but this is just, I don't know. This is another example of
00:36:13 just, I assume things are hard so I don't do them and therefore my life is terrible. Yeah,
00:36:18 yeah. Radical. I rescind everything that I said. Victor is an angel. Let's start the podcast over.
00:36:25 Yeah. Hey guys, welcome to the PCP. Here we've got Ben. Bye. This is sketchy later.
00:36:35 Just Ben, just, just Ben. Ben is the only one here. I don't, I, no, I'm not trying, I'm not trying
00:36:42 to make this all about the discord. I'm not trying to make this an rfck thing or anything,
00:36:46 but I do really want to talk about the fact that I was up all night last night making slimeoid
00:36:52 battles and this past week we really slimeoids and I'm just so fucking excited. I'm just so
00:36:57 fucking enthused. Ben, hold on. I'm gonna let you finish. I'm gonna let you finish. Yeah. We do have
00:37:03 our own show, you know. What are you, what are you talking about? We can just talk about this on
00:37:08 rfck. There's no reason. Why can't I talk about it here? I wanna fucking share what I'm passionate
00:37:12 about with my fucking friends, you piece of shit. Okay, no problem. Okay. What I'm saying
00:37:18 is that it's basically the entire topic so far has been like rfck. No it fucking hasn't. What the
00:37:25 fucking talking about. It's been, it's been prevalent. It's been prevalent. No, it has not. It has been
00:37:29 ancillary and best. Continue.
00:37:33 Quite Munchy is like such a, like a psychopath. He's such a piece of shit. You know what happened?
00:37:42 Munchy has stolen so many dads. He just is a dad now. That's what we're experiencing.
00:37:47 What are you talking about? Listen guys, I'm not trying to be stern right now. I know you're not
00:37:52 trying to but like the fact that- I can be fun too. I'm just one of the boys. You know I'm just
00:37:56 one of the boys. Guys, what are you playing now? It's Mario still playing. Listen to this
00:38:01 wolf in sheep's clothing. Oh, it's funny. It's weird that Munchy being the youngest one is
00:38:11 currently doing the hello fellow kids. I know. I think so. Ben, do you know if there's a
00:38:16 discord server that I can join and play in browser for free and that might be text based
00:38:20 based on old mud type games? Do you know- I might have heard of- Oh yeah, the mud puddle. Go to
00:38:25 discord.com.com. Splash. Ben, what are you talking about? Slymoids. I just- I don't know. I just-
00:38:36 Someone ask me something about them. I just want to gush about them. Dude, what the fuck?
00:38:39 Dude, what the fuck? Sweet Mouse messaged me like two hours ago being like,
00:38:46 hey, so I want to make the best Slymoid I can make for when Slymoid battling becomes a thing.
00:38:52 Let me ask you some questions about Slymoid Brains. How does Slymoid Brains work? And I was
00:38:56 like, oh my god, I'm so fucking enthused to tell you all about how Slymoid Brains work, dude.
00:39:01 I was like, man, this- this brain does this and that. This one sucks. This brain is pretty good
00:39:06 if you want to do this kind of thing. And I don't know how this is going to work yet, but probably
00:39:09 this brain will be- This brain's like nature's-
00:39:13 Basic, more or less. You can- you can- you can choose all the different parts. You can- you
00:39:18 assemble your- your Slymoid from all these different parts and you get to choose what kind of brain
00:39:21 it has. And depending on what kind of brain you give it, it will have- well, it has different like
00:39:26 personality behaviors when you interact with it and it like behaves- it's gonna like behave
00:39:30 differently and it's gonna have like a different AI sort of- sort of controlling it. Um, it's so
00:39:36 so fucking cool. I'm just so fucking jazzed about it 24 hours a day.
00:39:42 It's good that you actually finished the thing you were trying to do because you've got a lot of
00:39:45 stuff to- to- to get done and you're always like- you've been like stressing out about Slymoids for a
00:39:51 while. So yeah, that's good to be done. The end of season one was when I started working on Slymoids
00:39:58 and then- It's been a while. Yeah, it was like a long- and then like season two came out and the
00:40:01 code was all different and I got frustrated and then I took another crack at it and I realized
00:40:05 that like it needed to interact with the database and the way I didn't understand so I got my friend
00:40:09 John to fucking show me how the database works and then I went back to it and I realized that nothing
00:40:13 I had written would work with how I now understand the database to work so I had just fucking redo
00:40:17 it all from scratch and then the other like a week ago or two weeks ago now maybe or something
00:40:22 like that I finally finished it and then- and then it comes out and everyone loves it. Everyone's
00:40:27 making their slime but it's not like okay now it's time for the most arduous task of all taking
00:40:31 everything I've done and build- and building upon it to create Slymoid battle system. Okay,
00:40:37 I'm gonna have to throw out everything I did before and start from scratch and then I tested it
00:40:40 and like everything that I made from battle system actually worked fine and it just needed
00:40:43 minor tweaks and it was done in like a day and a half so that's coming out really soon. Ben and I
00:40:49 hung out a week ago when you're listening to this and I can confirm that every 30 minutes
00:40:56 when there was like a slight lowland conversation like a two second gap here you just sigh and say
00:41:01 oh when Slymoid battling comes out like you'll all see you'll all rue the day you picked on little old
00:41:07 Ben at the same. Yeah. You'll all realize the fool you know yourselves returning me down for
00:41:16 for junior prom. Yeah exactly. When I just showed up with my new Slymoid wife. The whole motivation
00:41:22 for this was that when Jenny shot you down that was the moment you decided someday I'm gonna have a
00:41:27 discord server. Jenny I miss you you bitch! Ben I just want to know when are you doing your sabbatical
00:41:36 you've been talking about sabbatical for like three fucking months and I have not I have not
00:41:40 seen you turn hide nor tail. You know the truth okay so when we recorded when we recorded that
00:41:47 17 hour nightmare horror show rfck episode. We're gonna do that again I hope you know.
00:41:54 No we're not I'm never playing sprawl ever again. No we're not we don't we don't do
00:41:59 brawls. Okay well when we recorded that yeah I talked in the conversation about how I wanted to
00:42:04 take a sabbatical from the internet and the truth is that I kind of have been like I haven't been
00:42:10 like on my discord very much I haven't really been like doing much on the internet so I just
00:42:18 I don't know I just didn't like at the time I thought maybe I would announce like okay I'm
00:42:22 unplugging from the internet and I'm going away for like you know a month or two until
00:42:27 shit's done but then like I don't know just something clicked in my head like maybe a week
00:42:32 or two ago and like suddenly I fucking buckled down and I got slymoids done and I like I did like
00:42:39 two new vapors pages in like three days and that was like you know a recent record that was I couldn't
00:42:45 believe how long it had been I had let that shit lie fallow for so long it was I can't
00:42:50 fucking believe how long it went without drawing a new page I hate it I fucking hate it but I'm
00:42:55 but it's okay but it's okay because I'm back so I'm fucking back and slymoids are done and it's
00:43:00 all about the vapors now you know what you know it's slightly also too bad which is also almost
00:43:04 done you know it's like you're disturbing bin yeah for for our relationship as humans is that you
00:43:10 can like log off from the internet from the internet softcore and I view no change in the
00:43:16 amount of time that like we interact in fact it almost goes up in a way I haven't been logged off
00:43:21 I just have not been engaging with like I haven't really been on Twitter you haven't really been
00:43:27 in my discord I've just been like there was a lot of wasting of time on the internet and now
00:43:33 you're using the internet for the constructive purpose I didn't view it as wasting of time
00:43:38 I just I viewed it as like you know arranging of time I well at that like like being on Twitter
00:43:43 and being in discord like that's how I like interact with people but yeah I think maybe
00:43:49 it was cutting in it was I was doing it at the expense of like you know working on shit
00:43:57 and I mean you're I mean you're supposed to interact with people right you're not supposed
00:44:01 to just work and not talk to anyone right no yes I think yeah that's something very important
00:44:08 and yet at this moment I feel so much better about things since I've stopped doing anything
00:44:15 since I've stopped communicating with people and just been working instead well I mean I feel if
00:44:21 you if it's been so long I was I was in balance yeah you were I was in balance I was in balance
00:44:26 and I've tilted the other way now and and it'll feel good for a while until you start feeling
00:44:32 the longing for social interaction I mean you know you gotta balance the back out
00:44:36 moderation in all things as I'm sure you know like no I don't know moderation I can't do it I can't
00:44:43 do anything but not like I can't I can't do anything without throwing myself into it completely
00:44:49 and being like this is what I am now then there are huge and the same goes for the everything I can't
00:44:56 like I can't like tape or something back I just if I if I if I tape or something back at all if I
00:45:01 push something even slight if if something goes behind anything else in my mind's eye it's gone
00:45:06 it's gone and I don't touch it I'm a hundred percent on board with this horrible mentality
00:45:11 it's horrible it's it's ruined everything there's a huge difference between talking to people in
00:45:17 your discord fan server and talking to your friends there's I would say that like what is
00:45:23 important for you to do sure like networking and and you know like community management quote
00:45:28 unquote is important but I would say what most people mean when they say you guys talk to people
00:45:33 you can't just focus on your art is just talk to your friends and get more input even just for
00:45:38 your art it's important to have second opinions and stuff like that it's not so much people are
00:45:42 thinking oh yeah go post on forums you got you gotta you gotta go post on some forums uh you know
00:45:48 you meet your form post quota for every comic page you make it's more like you gotta have
00:45:53 more fucking human action genuine ones watching a presentation uh some guy was making this point
00:46:00 that like artists are terrible at like networking or like making time in person to like talk about
00:46:06 their craft um he was this thing was specifically talking about like actors he was presenting
00:46:12 something like actors thing but he just like it said applied to artists in general because he was
00:46:16 saying like you know the most of the time that like when you're an actor and you see other actors
00:46:21 is when you're like going for a role and you all want to kill each other because we're all fighting
00:46:25 like there's never a time when you can just talk about your craft in a like normal kind of friendly
00:46:32 way and like artists in general are bad right if you're if you're an actor and you're doing like
00:46:36 some performative art or something you know your art and your job means you're interacting with people
00:46:43 like right now you know i'm talking to other humans right now i'm talking to hippo ben tom and mage
00:46:49 like i can like trick myself and they're thinking all right that's that's good enough human interaction
00:46:55 you know i've got my fill for today no more please and just go back to working on you know endless
00:46:59 work code or whatever it is that i do but i mean i'm not trying to say that this podcast isn't you
00:47:06 know good or that we shouldn't do and it's not good for our friendship or anything i'm just saying
00:47:11 like this is not really you know this is way different than when me and ben were hanging right
00:47:16 this isn't shooting the shit we're all putting on a subtle performance right now we're all exaggerating
00:47:20 and regressing parts of our personality in order to be more entertaining this is not the way we
00:47:25 talk to each other off camera i don't want to glorify shooting the shit or anything like it's
00:47:27 not like i think it's like a super productive thing to do i just think your mind sort of
00:47:32 cag lugs it differently i think it's i think it's healthy to shoot the shit every once in a while
00:47:37 at the very least i think human interaction is important in person iRL for real i mean i would
00:47:44 say that even though we were you know shooting the shit and talking casually we weren't trying to fill
00:47:49 every you know silence gap with with you know content for people to drown in we did talk about
00:47:56 you know art and work stuff yesterday ben we did talk about stuff to do it was i wouldn't say maybe
00:48:02 productive but i mean that's how all ideas are made right you know two friends are talking
00:48:08 and they think huh maybe we should do this you know maybe they made a joke and they're like you
00:48:12 know that could turn into a real projects and boom bada bing bada boom you've got a t-bap or
00:48:16 something like that you know i've talked about this on the show before um it doesn't feel that
00:48:25 different being on here than it does just talking to someone in a normal setting because like
00:48:32 you're always performing right even if you're just talking to a person in real life like
00:48:38 you're still on it to a degree it's not like oh now i'm on but when it's my friends in real life
00:48:45 i'm not no i'm still like trying to be i'm still like i'm still like trying to be cool and trying
00:48:52 to make people like me through the way that i interact with them like that that doesn't turn
00:48:57 off no i think you turn it up or down though depending on the the context of the situation
00:49:04 well i don't think i don't think i don't think i don't think maybe aside from munchie i don't
00:49:10 think we really put on that much of a show um individually on the pcp because it ends up being
00:49:19 you know just us talking about stuff generally like i've seen in in radcons like we would make
00:49:27 jokes that we would make in a podcast in real life we would do funny things all the time and
00:49:32 then we would have quieter moments where somebody's just talking about something and it's like it
00:49:36 feels pretty much the same i mean anyway the difference is the conversation itself the conversation
00:49:43 topics where i would probably talk about and ask about way different things on a podcast and i would
00:49:52 ask someone else you know one-on-one in person or you know in a group in person just hanging out
00:49:58 talking casually when i'm talking here the sort of topics they bring up are usually meant to be
00:50:05 you know entertaining in one way or another either i guess i guess that's why the podcast
00:50:09 sucks is i don't think about what could be entertaining for the audience enough um i think
00:50:15 i whereas i would probably ask more i don't know personal things that i would usually want to talk
00:50:21 about more you know i would bring up wouldn't be necessarily be good podcast material it would
00:50:30 just be something i want to know about you what you've been doing and you know what you want to
00:50:34 continue to do i would be happy and talk about you know maybe some some taboo drama that's come
00:50:42 up recently with ben that you know we can't talk about on the show because there's none of there's
00:50:48 none of that by the way that's there is no i was i was wondering what it really sounded like you
00:50:53 were hinting at something no i just want to like no there's no that that's a hypothetical yeah
00:50:58 oh but you know what i mean right you get you get what i'm trying to yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:51:06 yeah it's a different sort of air it's a different i mean i mean it's not exactly i don't think i'm
00:51:10 putting on a character right now like i don't think that like munchie is separated from how i am in
00:51:16 real life i don't even think that he's particularly like some sort of like on staroids hidden version
00:51:22 of how i am it's just i get nervous when i get nervous i say kooky things and scream in parentheses
00:51:28 usually but you know when i'm off air i don't have to work i don't have to be nervous because i'm
00:51:34 just with my friends and i don't think they'll hate me if i say something wrong i mean they might
00:51:39 but i don't operate under the fact that they will i'm not i don't ever like i would never
00:51:45 consider talking with one of you guys like just off air like performing anything that's just how i am
00:51:51 when i'm talking to you guys that's just i don't know everything's like everything you do in life
00:51:56 is a performance even yourself sometimes if you want to be fucking if you want to wax philosophical
00:52:01 pseudo philosophically then okay maybe but i think there's a very clear at least in my you know in my
00:52:08 worldview very very distinct and clear difference recording a podcast and talking to someone else
00:52:15 it's not for me it's the lines the lines very blurry the lines very wide
00:52:21 gradient for me i mean i want to talk about just like the physical stuff i'm looking at my computer
00:52:27 screen i'm looking at a microphone right now i'm not looking at someone else's face but i'm but
00:52:31 i'm talking to you guys the same way that i would if i wasn't being recorded is what i'm getting at
00:52:38 sure i don't really think i'm i think there's still a bit of a difference just even if you don't
00:52:45 mean it it's still it's still maybe well maybe i can't maybe i can't accurately self assess that
00:52:51 it's it's a difference that nobody would ever like it's so um unique to you what you literally
00:52:58 actually acts like when nobody's watching right that nobody would ever know unless they spy on you
00:53:05 and i don't want to do that or do i what do you know now i'm interested to see if this comes across
00:53:13 at all in the way i speak when you guys like we're talking to me at during the non-recording
00:53:18 moments of icon three or even just when we were out you know doing something whatever when we were
00:53:23 talking casually do you sense much of a difference in the way that i am or is it all the only thing
00:53:30 that seems different is that sometimes on a podcast you'll have like an actual script in front of
00:53:36 you that you wrote and you read it but outside of that not really no i i do i don't like i haven't
00:53:45 the the things that are like recorded are like more memorable because i've seen them more than once
00:53:50 but like i do remember times when munchie is just sort of there and it's he's not like doing
00:53:55 boring you know yeah like like for a lack of a better term like not being haha it's me munchie
00:54:01 like how dare he not entertain the masses well i mean you're not doing that right now
00:54:06 like you're not you're not like that all the time not that he's not like being like a core
00:54:11 jester i mean like um he wouldn't necessarily have a thing on his mind to say next it would just be
00:54:19 like wherever the conversation is going um you know if he has something to say he'll say it if he
00:54:24 doesn't and he doesn't but like in a in a podcast there's this constant pressure to think of the
00:54:30 next thing that has to be said about this or like what you want what you want the the the public to
00:54:37 know you think about certain topics recording a podcast is like killing a vampire you're trying
00:54:43 to reload your shotgun while the vampire is making his moves and and and because of that you're not
00:54:48 looking at the vampire you're not trying to see where he's circle strafing or where he's moving
00:54:52 this lens you're just focused on reloading your own shotgun just shoot him with am i the vampire
00:54:57 we're all the vampire bin we're all the vampire no one's the shotgun the viewers of the shotgun
00:55:04 i i have a thing about like working and stuff you have to raise your hand before you can start
00:55:11 squeezing i did i've been raising it this whole time but you can't see because you're just looking at
00:55:15 the screen oh wow just another shotgun that's why you can't see your hand just another failure of the
00:55:20 medium of podcast not delivering me my raw friendship i couldn't see him raise his hand that
00:55:25 was crucial to my appreciation of him as a person uh my little brother who uh you may know as the
00:55:33 master kota who created uh runaway from snakes the video game buy it now on itchio.com slash
00:55:41 charlie batten uh cool guy obviously because he's my brother i like him he's making a new game which
00:55:49 is like oh wretched and clank-esque whoa what uh yeah he's got like a weapon wheel and he's figuring
00:55:55 out how to do like water ripple effects and stuff and he's got jumping it's really cute it's really
00:56:00 good and i'm really proud of him he needs to get in the iam games discord and get into the devlog
00:56:05 channel because we all circle jerk about our games and that and it's great motivation this
00:56:09 is gonna have a thousand fucking discord invite links yeah yeah yeah but uh he's doing all that
00:56:15 stuff and i'm like okay this is good this this means he is like still a like this is he hasn't
00:56:21 done a shade and like stopped making uh what he makes he hasn't done a shade and like stopped making
00:56:26 music he i i mean i haven't kept up the shade makes pizzas right he makes pizzas now he does make
00:56:32 pizzas yeah so like surely those aren't mutually exclusive well he's a manager so he's not like
00:56:38 making them deliberately i don't know maybe managers do maybe when it gets really busy the
00:56:41 the manager has to step out of his office he's got to like take off his suit and tie and put on
00:56:45 one of those blue shirts i'm like get some like flour on his hands like all right pizza it's time
00:56:50 fucking year i'm getting real pissed about it when is he gonna upload that 3d printed image
00:56:56 dude i want to 3d print the pizza myself i want to go to shade and be like shade i want a custom
00:57:00 pizza i want to request like down to the millimeter the amount of the thickness of the crust if you
00:57:07 if you pledge to shade on patreon to get a custom pizza
00:57:12 shade is making sick custom pizzas every month every month over you gonna say yeah yeah yeah um
00:57:18 so he's making a new game and he's intercoding stills which is this good thing for me because
00:57:23 i want to make another game um with his skills well i mean yeah it's like oh i'm not i'm not a
00:57:30 part of the creative process because whatever but like he is like my contractor or i'm the other
00:57:36 the other way around he is like the the muscle and i am the brains and i have to think of all
00:57:40 the cool shit but who's the heart and i'm just um it's it's a very it's annoying because i have
00:57:47 this idea for this game and i have an idea for a comic that will be you know like run away from
00:57:53 snakes was part of the bell jpeg comic my next comic i'm thinking oh i could make a game for that as
00:57:59 well and it'll be like a thing i do and and so i've got a new comic idea that is swirling around
00:58:05 in my head i've got a new game idea i've got this idea that i could like model the main character
00:58:09 in 3d and i'll be really cool do it i've got all these things going on and i can't do any of them
00:58:15 because i'm supposed to be doing something else with a deadline that is like eating up into my entire
00:58:20 december i haven't been doing anything other than working on this this one thing it sucks because
00:58:27 all these new cool ideas fresh and unique that i just can't spend any time working with
00:58:33 we gotta do this is what you gotta do you gotta you gotta write everything down every time you
00:58:37 have a cool idea write it down so you can get back to it when when you have i mean i have been writing
00:58:41 them down i got like google docs all the time for not writing them down and it is the most
00:58:46 retarded thing ever hit hippo before i respond to your actual point i just want to say whenever
00:58:52 you come to radcon or just after the pcp when we're recording you just splay your teeth out wide
00:58:59 and i just want to suckle it so badly but it's so hard i can never get it in one clean pump
00:59:06 it always leaves me so unsatisfied whenever i go pee so i have to hear this i get so fucking mad
00:59:15 whenever you're like um yeah you know i'm just like we're gonna move you like it's no big deal
00:59:20 i hate elk Baldwin you know you know what i mean uh and and then you know i approach you i corner you
00:59:26 to get some of that tid in my mouth and you're just like um well you know it's not really a big
00:59:30 deal so i'm not even really gonna talk about you know like whatever i'm just making the movies just
00:59:33 a script you know whatever i don't even care it is just a script i mean there's looks to it but
00:59:39 like i don't i don't know how to talk about it like i'm not a screenwriting analyst i didn't i
00:59:46 didn't cut my teeth on reviewing scripts or your shows all i know is that when you know occasionally
00:59:54 you'll post some work from from your or you know just talking about on the pcp chat it'll be like
00:59:59 a whole new world and and you'll post like some animated trailer that i'm not even supposed to
01:00:03 talk about don't worry haha uh and i'll just like lose my fucking mind because i like i don't
01:00:11 recognize my mind that it's like real because i don't know anything about it so i just think ah
01:00:15 hippo he he code it scripts that's just code word for gay sex he's just a gay person now that's what
01:00:21 he means because i haven't i don't know anything about it i actually see proof of it it just i
01:00:27 fucking go insane it's it's something i don't know how to upsell well i don't want to i don't
01:00:34 want like i don't want you to like fucking i don't know like like trying no no i i'll i'm okay with
01:00:40 talking about it a little bit it's just i don't really know how to to explain like what is it about
01:00:47 like i've been doing it for a while now so certain things i've learned and i've just come to accept
01:00:53 and i'm not sure which is like the most interesting part the most interesting part to me is that you
01:00:59 are in the industry and that is cool all this yes the pcp has built up a culture of anti-industry
01:01:05 for good reasons and i'm not trying to say that it's squeaky clean or anything but uh when it's
01:01:11 when did cartoons and movies stop being cool when did you know working in bank groups and having
01:01:16 you know a budget that stopped being cool it's nice to be in the industry you know who was in the
01:01:20 industry fucking don bluthy you know who was in the industry ariel from my little mermaid
01:01:30 i'm just trying to say some good things can happen when you got two people together fun and
01:01:35 in fact i uh one of the times i went to a thing for like pitching an animation show
01:01:44 i met an old dane danish man and he said he used to work with don bluth i was like oh
01:01:51 did you say yeah i know that guy it's not really a big deal like you're not really that special
01:01:54 because like you know like i played dragon lace too so yeah and i would be the shit out of him
01:01:58 and left him in the in the in the sewer yeah what if um no it was just cool it was just like
01:02:03 we talked about stuff um but i'm like such as idiot that i didn't think to make a connection
01:02:09 with him and i don't know anything about like how to contact him but you know it's one of those
01:02:14 things just one of those industry things when you're a fucking idiot and you don't have an
01:02:17 imdb that you look at you know it's not really a big deal you want to go and shave my balls
01:02:22 what's the thing what's the thing where like all the business people have an account and
01:02:27 linkedin yeah i should i should be looking at a linkedin i should be doing that
01:02:31 hippo are you gonna you have you're gonna have an imdb you're gonna have an imdb
01:02:36 and it's gonna be your writing credits oh you're gonna be a real human
01:02:41 oh the show you're gonna be on is hippocrit show like deceased
01:02:49 yes oh god please don't do that if it comes out don't add hippocrit to it just please don't do
01:02:57 that it will be funny but don't oh i cannot wait for you to get james gunned i cannot wait for you
01:03:03 to get james gunned down where you uh are you successful screenwriter and you make and you
01:03:08 make gardens galaxy three and uh then then then the the the uppers at disney see the hippocrit
01:03:14 show and see like i hate mud that's a terror that's a terrible substance and texture deleted
01:03:20 they're gonna fire you it's gonna have to happen to all of us none of us are clean we're all
01:03:27 gonna go a little bit of mud on us because i want to get into like major specifics and i don't want to
01:03:31 like like spoil or also like break contract or whatever i don't want to i don't want to deal
01:03:38 in trouble with it's not about like breaking contracts it's just like the more i talk about it
01:03:44 the more it becomes a thing in people's minds and if it just falls through at some point i will
01:03:51 have nothing and people will be like oh so i don't want i you know i i'm just being cautious about
01:03:58 it i understand that makes sense however fuck off and i want more but after so your your brother's
01:04:06 making video games and he's a coder yes he is a coder he is a unity uh 3d man uh he's very very
01:04:14 smart always has been smart for his age probably because he hung around with me who was years
01:04:19 older and therefore like when he went to school this is this has always been funny to me where he
01:04:24 would like talk to me about like philosophical things that i was having when i was whatever age
01:04:29 i was he brought those like thoughts into his younger class and nobody fucking got it and
01:04:35 everyone was stupid and he said guys my people in my class suck and it's been like that forever
01:04:42 like he's just smarter than everyone around him so he's calling munchie is that what you're trying
01:04:46 to say yeah he's basically my munchie that i have created he's just been giving him some
01:04:50 intellectual rare candies all his life you know you know that that's really cool you know brothers
01:04:54 are coder hey tom do you know if there's a free podcast on the internet so that someone could
01:04:58 listen to an original like i don't know uh learn code let me let me let me just think
01:05:04 i think there's one called uh uh killing code i think i think that's what's called
01:05:09 that that might be one i hate one of the on the host on there he just streams and doesn't
01:05:13 actually have any insight it's really funny i like that podcast it's pretty it's pretty good
01:05:19 there's only one episode right i listened to the first one there's two there's two i haven't
01:05:23 know some of the second one yet uh can i be on sometime and brag about slime oids that's not
01:05:29 no you can't and just talk about all the coding i did that's that's very that's a very talk about
01:05:34 all the things that i talk about all the things that i learned you have to buy the book that we're
01:05:38 going through and you have to talk about what we're doing in the book uh yeah but i look i look
01:05:44 look it's an educational buy the book i don't go buy the book okay i'm i'm i'm a cowboy i'm in the
01:05:50 wild west of coding python i mean i understand that's what i was doing with gd scripts and then
01:05:57 munchie like corralled me into being uh uh uh educated he's he's sinking his college bound
01:06:03 teeth into my brain and getting me to like buy a book and use curriculum it's crazy i don't even
01:06:08 know what's going on it's totally different it's almost like being taught you know is is less painful
01:06:14 and more engaging and educational than just trying bullshit and just making hackneyed code
01:06:19 i don't know if i agree though i had i think i i i the reason i wanted to do this podcast
01:06:25 is because there were fundamentals that i did ignore and it was going to bite me in the ass
01:06:30 but i will say it is way more fun to just open up g'dow and like all right how do i make this
01:06:36 character move and just start googling until he starts moving then to uh do a plus b in parentheses
01:06:44 and finish yeah it's uh worth mentioning my brother went to like coding uh university course
01:06:50 and he passed and is is good um but he's still like regularly when he needs specific information
01:06:55 will google a tutorial about how to do something i mean like that's what a lot of our comment section
01:07:00 on the podcast so far has been is like you have to as soon as possible abandon your your uh book
01:07:06 and just go out into the wild because that's the way you're actually going to learn how to code
01:07:10 sure i'm not saying that you don't learn by experience i'm just saying it's good to know
01:07:16 where to start it's good to have both yeah you gotta have the fundamentals i would not know
01:07:21 what the fuck to google if i didn't have this book and just like all right like how to code
01:07:26 python there would be like an there would be like an hour long youtube video about it
01:07:30 and that would just be some fucking schmuck explain things there is yeah there's um when i was
01:07:36 when i tried to learn i go like the like the first time when i when i tried to um
01:07:43 when i was when when endless war was just a twinkle in my eye and i went and tried to learn
01:07:47 the right way i found yeah these these youtube videos called uh automate the boring stuff with
01:07:53 python which turns out i actually found that book lying around my house like later yeah
01:08:00 turns out that like those youtube lessons were like the guy who wrote the book sort of delivering
01:08:05 the first couple chapters of his book via youtube video um but i didn't get anywhere very fast with
01:08:11 that it was too basic and it was too slow um i probably if i had not been in a hurry i maybe
01:08:18 could have stuck with it i do i like i like just sort of googling shit and just like learning
01:08:25 like that's kind of how i do most things i just google shit and i just whatever i want to do i just
01:08:30 look around and try and figure out just how to do this one thing and it's all very willy nilly
01:08:35 and nonsense and it's it's pretty fun but i definitely have gaps i definitely have gaps in
01:08:41 my knowledge like um i don't know i i was talking to you earlier we were looking at the um we're
01:08:50 looking at the database and like he he like knew all the like for me to debug something i just have
01:08:56 to like make a change to the code run the program see what it does and then try and like figure out
01:09:02 why did it do that he had like strats he like typed something in so that like the the the fucking
01:09:09 my sql thing would spit out like a result explaining like what happened when the code is run
01:09:15 which is like i don't know what how'd you do that um would probably be helpful for me to know
01:09:20 right and i don't that that's that's the that's why i wanted to start that's why i stopped doing gd
01:09:25 script and decided to do the podcast of munchies because like there i got to the point where the
01:09:31 my lack of the fundamentals were compounding upon themselves and causing more issues and
01:09:35 like i had to go back like i could have kept going forward and like fucking like just like duct taped
01:09:41 all my code together and it would have worked but i could see like the scope of my project was like
01:09:46 if i keep going this way it will eventually jenga all over my my ui and destroy my code forever so
01:09:54 i had to go back i had to turn around i had to abandon all the cool stuff about like getting
01:09:59 attack animations and physics calculations and all this cool shit i had to go back and i had to do
01:10:03 a plus b in brackets uh declare variables and be like i guess i gotta learn how this basic
01:10:09 baby stuff works so i can go build the real shit and that's where we are right now yeah to me it's
01:10:16 it's like i don't even know how i could possibly like just start i mean i guess that's how he started
01:10:23 doing drawing right like i didn't have a good book to teach me how to draw i just started putting
01:10:28 pencil paper and eventually i got good but i don't think it's a stretch to say maybe if not i had a
01:10:33 book but you know if there was an art class at my school probably would have got better
01:10:38 way faster and way less hardship in the beginning it's interesting you say that much because i can
01:10:42 explain exactly what would happen if you had just done what i did because i did it um the part we're
01:10:47 at in the book right now where we're talking about uh functions and arguments you know uh i was just
01:10:55 following tutorials on how to make a platformer in godot and they would just tell you to type
01:10:59 these functions and i had no idea what a function is uh i just typed it out and i didn't understand
01:11:05 what arguments were because they they just assume in these videos i was watching that you know what
01:11:09 an argument is because you know how to program right wink wink and i was like no i'm just copying
01:11:13 what you did wink wink so like i would just get to the point they'd be like you gotta put these
01:11:18 arguments in i'm like why what is the point of an argument why is this happening here i don't
01:11:23 understand i'm just copying what you're saying and i understand what it does but i don't understand
01:11:27 why it does it and i was getting to the point where i would like stop following the tutorials
01:11:31 because the tutorial i was following the dude had a kid and just abandoned the thing mid mid like
01:11:36 thing so like there's no more band in the kid yeah he just abandoned the kid and kept making
01:11:41 coding videos for me specifically because i PMed him and he decided to keep going no so the the
01:11:46 series ended i was like well now what i do so then i like started watching another tutorial that was
01:11:50 like how to make a zelda clone i was trying to reverse engineer like the code from that to put
01:11:55 it into a platformer and i did figure out like wall collisions and stuff and i felt like a god
01:11:59 but eventually it was just like i still don't know what a function is i just know yeah so it's like i
01:12:05 gotta go back i gotta go back so like you just understand what and not why and uh it becomes a
01:12:12 problem i remember like coding coding like little games on multimedia fusion 2 and there was like
01:12:20 easy code for babies where um they spoke in in plain english like if character touches side of
01:12:27 screen stop movement so like they can't go off the screens like okay now i understand code um of
01:12:35 course i didn't but like they have these these other things which were like completely alien to me
01:12:39 and i didn't google them because i didn't know what google was because i didn't care enough to try
01:12:45 um like and gates and or gates and x or gates and things that are like the basic fundamentals of
01:12:52 like uh computer chips and like electronic pulses going around uh computer chips to just determine
01:12:59 whether something should go on or off and that's like that's uh it's hard that's that's hard to do
01:13:10 that's too fundamental i mean yeah but like i i i really enjoy understanding the fundamentals
01:13:15 because like watching my brother code he's doing all this fancy stuff and i ask him uh how like what
01:13:21 he's doing uh affects the thing and he'll give me some sort of explanation and i was like okay so
01:13:28 and then i like translate what he's doing into english that i can understand he's like yes that's
01:13:32 how it works i'm like sick like i love i love translating code um speak into uh like human
01:13:41 words like when this happens that happens oh i get it that's cool see man i am straight up telling you
01:13:50 miracles it's like all right computers right what the fuck miracles is what
01:13:59 that's how i feel every day in coding miracle in a box exactly it's magic
01:14:05 that's all needs to be said dude we're gonna be wizards that's the whole point of learning code
01:14:10 mage do you have like uh tuberculosis what is wrong with your car
01:14:14 uh i i don't know what's wrong with my car uh it's i have phlegm in my lungs i guess gross
01:14:24 how much are you selling that for oh that's not an ooh that's good that's good stuff right there
01:14:30 but it's like that's like that's slime adjacent that's slime adjacent that's slime adjacent that
01:14:36 that would go for like twelve dollars per pint oh my god no don't make this weird
01:14:41 weird time i just talked about your phlegm on the podcast look i'll DM you after the podcast
01:14:47 we can just we can discuss rates uh fucking getting colds during the the winter times it
01:14:55 always happens always i don't think i'm quite over mine it's my yearly tradition i step outside for
01:15:02 one second and i catch a cold and i die every single year oh no i did not get a cold this
01:15:09 season but something happened to me my one night i just slept on my head weird or something
01:15:15 and like the next day my neck hurt and it has not and it's just my neck hurt for like a week
01:15:21 it's kind of going away now it's kind of it's i can kind of i don't know i've had that but for
01:15:25 like two years it's the white thing i'm trying to imagine like a like a neck thing like you know
01:15:31 you'd folded your neck like forwards onto your chest and you were sleeping for a chest down
01:15:36 and your head was completely folded in on itself was like i just don't know what happened i think
01:15:42 i just like slept with my head like turned a little too far to the side and pulled a muscle
01:15:47 or something yeah i think that happened to me as well i i had to change pillows honestly because
01:15:53 apparently my pillow was too hard so i had to buy a new one it just kept i just kept the muscles in
01:16:01 my head kept getting sore and i just couldn't sleep and it was just awful it was awful i used to i
01:16:06 used to have a bed that was way too fucking soft and every day i my back hurt i would wake up in
01:16:14 my fucking back hurt and i was like i you'd think that a soft bed is like good for you like it's like
01:16:19 gentle it's like gentle it's like gentle on your body you know it's like oh i just like like laying
01:16:24 on a cloud no it fucking killed me it killed me and it ruined my life um oh no and now i sleep on
01:16:31 fucking stone slab you know now i sleep in a coffin and it's red you sleep on a stone slab
01:16:39 and then i stab you through the heart and you ascend to god tier yeah this sleep discussion
01:16:44 being dangerously close to dream discussion oh if i like the way mage did this on purpose
01:16:50 no no you were the one who brought it up i wasn't gonna mention any dreams you you heck heck all of
01:16:56 you were trying to you were trying to whoa whoa foul language she's bringing the hex hex
01:17:02 hex on upon you the heckles the shekels for the heckles and the shekels for the heck i need to be
01:17:10 on that show again i came up with the name of the show i need to i need to be i need to take
01:17:14 my you know i've only been on the first one i keep missing all the other ones i've been on two uh
01:17:20 do we do them like every sunday i don't know when we do them that's why i keep missing like we started
01:17:25 doing them every sunday but i think we've like gotten bad no it wasn't every sunday it was like
01:17:29 every other sunday oh okay then i guess it's not as bad as i thought yeah that's all within industry
01:17:37 guidelines then if people want to see me play dark souls with restrictions that was the last one that
01:17:42 was pretty fun i want to i want to continue that one i really really want to be on the shekels for
01:17:48 heckles but i'm never i never it's it's always poor timing for me aren't you like up all night
01:17:56 aren't you like a nocturnal vampire sometimes but sometimes i i have to do things and i cannot
01:18:03 part time vampire i don't know if i buy that i'm pretty sure i've been on every shekels for
01:18:08 heckles and let me just tell you you're not really missing out on anything it's like it's just like
01:18:13 that's because i'm not there to make it good uh i i think it's pretty fun i like it i just i just
01:18:20 want to hang out with you guys and maybe heckle someone for the game no no well you would have to
01:18:27 get in the chat okay so that the concept of the show mage is that people pay in super chats to
01:18:32 insult us that's where the shekels for heckles come from they give us money to insult us so you
01:18:38 want to be in the chat and pay us money to insult them oh no i mean someone has to read out the
01:18:46 heckles right you can't you can't you can't heckle for free but we're not obligated to feel bad about
01:18:51 yeah yeah yeah we're only obligated to feel bad about the ones people pay for i i will say that
01:18:57 yeah i also have people who have to read out the heckles right so that's true if you want to be
01:19:02 the heckle announcer all right you could you could be that yeah that's true yeah you could do that
01:19:06 stream is definitely feel closer to talking to like a normal person in real life they definitely
01:19:12 feel like less performative than a podcast right so being on a being on a stream feels exactly
01:19:20 like being on a pcp to me oh it feels way less responsibility to me because streams are just
01:19:26 by definition terrible just that's just part of the whole kid in caboodle of streaming is that i don't
01:19:32 there's like a terrible as in like like name a good like okay give me a stream that you were like
01:19:39 wow fucking great stream dude i want to name me a fucking podcast where you felt the same i wanted
01:19:45 to say i have games but i am games is a bad stream uh so there is the last there are some
01:19:50 pcp episodes and i'm like wow fucking home run great job keep it up there are moments in streams
01:19:57 that are just like yeah but they're fucking seven hours of bullshit and you get i think hippos
01:20:04 are totally on the money that a podcast is has the same problem in that it's just long content
01:20:10 and it's long content and sometimes there's something really funny and sometimes people get
01:20:14 ziggiegles completely disagree i mean i mean and the same thing can happen on a stream it just feels
01:20:20 a little less like you know i mean even i feel like the the lack of responsibility is what causes a
01:20:26 lot of the funniest moments in a stream sure but i if you want to like to get the good much
01:20:33 well streams have streams have a big like cut it out from there streams have a big leg up on
01:20:38 podcasts and that streams have the jar streams have the fucking jar all right which is a miracle
01:20:44 did you did you turned off the jar because he thought it looked bad and i'm just like you're
01:20:49 doing everything he thought we thought what he thought the aesthetic of the jar looked bad and
01:20:53 i'm like you're missing the point here's here's a thing i don't understand i see like every now
01:20:58 and then i pop on twitch and like i'm following maybe like you know i'm following a bunch of
01:21:02 like artists and stuff that i just followed in a way i'm like hey this person looks all right i'll
01:21:05 follow him maybe you'll check out a stream once in a while and everyone's got the jar
01:21:13 and like tiny like tiny in a corner that you can barely see it it has it looks like a little tip jar
01:21:19 like my streams like i said like my screen does not fill up my my my twitch stream generally so
01:21:27 i'll usually have like a big black space on the sides so i use that black space that's there
01:21:33 anyway and i put the giant fucking jar there and it's so fucking cool because people will like pour
01:21:39 in like you know one cent bits they'll fill up the jar with ones and bits and then someone will
01:21:42 subscribe and it's like an event like the stream like everyone is like focus it's like a it's like
01:21:48 an event when someone drops like a a sub or like a like a thousand bit you know bit piece in there
01:21:54 and it all just like crashes into it and sends it all like spewing out because it's like squirting
01:21:59 it out because of how heavy it is just squishing it down and sending it all flying it's it's a it's
01:22:03 a it's a tree man what what if you you made like like it's gotta be big which was like the goblet
01:22:09 of fire from harry potter but it was just the jar in the middle of the screen with like some some
01:22:14 like a pedestal wait and people would put their name into the jar of fire i've i've got it i just
01:22:21 had i just had you've given me a wonderful idea because i have been pushing for it i'm almost at
01:22:27 a thousand subscribers on uh you know twitch.tv slash thousand subscribers or not subscribers
01:22:35 i was gonna say holy shit dude you're loaded as fuck yeah that'd be a lot of money that'd be a
01:22:40 lot of money i'm almost a five grand a month easy and i've been um well twitch takes a cut but
01:22:47 whatever um so they would be and i and i've been and i've said like when i hit a thousand i'm gonna
01:22:53 do a 24 hour you know stream to celebrate and i don't but i don't know what i'm gonna do on it
01:22:59 i've been thinking i thought it'd be funny if i did like a 24 hour maple story stream or like i
01:23:03 did it i did a really long stream of hollow knight and i've got lots of hollow on it maybe
01:23:07 because you do 24 hours of hollow knight and i haven't decided i don't exactly know what
01:23:10 but what if i just did a 24 hour jar stream where it's just the jar and we just watch the jar and
01:23:17 comment on the various comings and goings that occur in the jar case in point that podcasts are
01:23:25 objectively superior to streams no find me one fucking person who prefers rck streams the episodes
01:23:33 one person um anyone well leave a comment literally one person
01:23:43 you know what i'll bet there will be oh but there's actually plenty i mean we don't get
01:23:46 as many views on the streams uh all all the feedback it's funny like thousands of people
01:23:52 watch the rfck videos but like 50 to like 70 tops show up to watch the streams and i don't know if
01:24:01 it's just like a timing thing right like it just seems like viewer numbers like the numbers are just
01:24:07 lower on twitch across the board and that's like i mean the the obvious like uh advantage of a video
01:24:14 rather than a live broadcast is that you can watch it at your leisure you can pause it you can come
01:24:19 back to it that's why i mean you can you can watch that you can watch the twitch vod is no one does
01:24:24 you like they're all why you put no one does that i know no one does it but like you can do it just
01:24:30 as easily it's i just like the site isn't set up to like funnel people into doing that the site is
01:24:36 set up to get people to watch people live and like the archive videos are sort of an afterthought
01:24:41 that's there but like the twitch doesn't want to acknowledge them the only feedback we ever get
01:24:46 on streams is either wow pretty good for a stream or wow wish you would record more in episodes
01:24:52 those are like the that's not we get four like the streams themselves we know i i mean yeah
01:25:00 nobody ever says that on a stream nobody ever says wow wish you would record more episodes people
01:25:04 are there there's not as many of them but there's but they're super engaged and they're super
01:25:09 they're fucking like interacting with like the community like yeah it's it's it's i mean it's
01:25:14 got its own it's its own thing like we couldn't rfck as it exists now would not exist if it was
01:25:21 if there were no streams so so there i think i don't how i guess okay we we we review the contest
01:25:32 on stream that's that's pretty connected but like and and you know we we talk about the game
01:25:40 on stream but like i don't think that's really anyone's major source of like a gaming news
01:25:47 or anything based on in the swore i think that's anyone's like main way to interact with the
01:25:52 discord server i don't think besides we would have to find a new way to review the contest
01:25:57 or and you need to you know like spotlight slam times but i don't think that would like if streams
01:26:03 were to just like disappear like the fanno gets fanno snapped i don't think there would be like
01:26:09 maybe there might be a handful of people who drop off you know the the bandwagon but i think it would
01:26:13 continue chugging along just as fine as it did before i don't think there's a lot of people
01:26:19 maybe it wouldn't i mean it wouldn't it wouldn't like die it wouldn't like die without i'm not saying
01:26:24 that it would die without oh my god it's christmas i forgot i was gonna talk about christmas in a
01:26:29 few days it will be christmas day i always i think that i love christmas you'll be watching this after
01:26:35 christmas day you don't get to do this you don't get to just cut in here and in the stream conversation
01:26:40 i'm actually i'm actually i'm actually done i'm actually very grateful you guys have talked about
01:26:45 rowdy focus cop killers a lot no yeah we have no yeah the thing that you said before was not true
01:26:50 when you said it munchie but it has become no this is not an rck thing this is not like an rck like
01:26:56 like like specific problem i just hate streams i think they're meandering i think they're all bad
01:27:02 and i hate them i don't know how you can possibly say that podcasts are just as bad when like
01:27:08 overwhelmingly podcasts are shorter and they are besides ours usually edited and usually more
01:27:15 entertaining i don't know i podcast who edits the podcasts what do you mean what do you mean by
01:27:21 this why why would you edit a game why would you edit a game there's always not paying attention
01:27:27 it's all it's just reading chat chats are a fucking curse i hate the chats on streams no no
01:27:32 no you that's not i'm asking why would why do people edit podcasts isn't the point of podcasts
01:27:37 to make the audio look or sound all right no no not like oh my fucking god they edit it
01:27:43 so they can edit out topics that weren't that interesting i imagine much better the pcb if
01:27:49 we did that there would be no pcb if we did that there wouldn't be any videos the the problem with
01:27:55 that specifically is that we're a rotating cast and um everybody will have different things to say
01:28:02 and a lot of the time running jokes come go from topic to topic so like cutting out a topic is not
01:28:08 as easy as it would be on a two-person show well i'm not which is why i'm not trying to advocate
01:28:14 my point is not to get the pcb to edit a podcast i'm not that's not what i meant i'm just saying
01:28:20 there's all right almost universally more effort put in well i love podcasts but i think streams
01:28:25 are cool i don't know what you're talking about i want to talk about they're all they're always
01:28:30 they're always born in meandering there's never i want to talk about i want to talk about i want
01:28:34 to talk about christmas now fine and how much i hate it and how much i think i like christmas
01:28:41 until it happens and then we get close to christmas and i'm like oh yeah lights snow i like the
01:28:46 aesthetic and then actual christmas then it comes for your wallet you're like this is the worst
01:28:51 and it's like tomorrow and i'm like oh god damn it fuck i don't want to fucking go like don't make
01:28:57 me go don't make me go jesus why did you do this to me listen i don't want to like you know be that
01:29:04 guy who's like oh fuck my family you know it's so annoying at them you know i like my family but i
01:29:10 just want to say you know what we all know is the case if we didn't have family obligations we would
01:29:16 never hang out with our family on christmas never agreed agreed of course um no i don't
01:29:23 agree with that yeah but like that's because uh your family sounds pretty good it sounds it is
01:29:30 you got a programming brother and a cool dad that's what i know about the one the one good thing
01:29:36 that's gonna happen this christmas is that my mom is gonna trade me her shiny swab blue
01:29:43 i'm gonna have a lucky shiny swab blue i'm gonna evolve it into ulteria and i've decided i thought
01:29:49 long and hard i thought long and hard i considered many names for a shiny a shiny ulteria and i almost
01:29:55 went with dawn but i think i'm gonna go with glory i'm gonna call it glory it's gonna be the coolest
01:30:00 thing ever and that's it that's what i'm gonna call my one pearly gates i i like my family don't
01:30:07 get me wrong i'm not saying this is like a like i'm so annoyed by my family that i have to spend
01:30:12 time with them like oh mom i just want to play my nintendo switch i just this is the reason
01:30:17 why halloween is great is because you could it's a holiday which is fun in and of itself it's fun
01:30:23 to be festive every once in a while and you can hang there's no you know you're not gonna go to
01:30:26 your fucking parents for halloween it's not the type of holiday you can just hang out with your friends
01:30:31 and you know eat black eyes while while watching an iam game stream or being online that's all
01:30:37 you have to do in halloween what's a black guy uh what we were fed by digi and me it's a meatball
01:30:42 with olive on it oh those are weird but for christmas i okay you know i don't mind going over to my
01:30:52 families you know you know have christmas day you know open presents or whatever but i really just
01:30:57 want to i i what i want to do they just want to hang out with ben and tom at digi's house
01:31:02 well digi's not there and just make a muck out of the place that's what i wanted that's what i'm
01:31:06 looking forward to you know yeah it's gonna be fun to be with old people you know it'll be nice to
01:31:12 catch up but like that's not what i'm about that's not what i want to do on the lord's day well i think
01:31:19 part of that might be because you also have thanksgiving which is exactly the same thing
01:31:24 hey and that and that's kind of close by we don't have that so like this is the family time of the
01:31:29 year i look forward to i already did i already did think i already did thanksgiving a month ago
01:31:35 i'm sick of it i'm fucking sick of it i want to i want to i want to state my opinion as to why
01:31:41 i like christmas do you understand there i want to complain about something well you can go on
01:31:47 first yeah i like i like i like christmas a lot because um i am not a fan of winter i snow
01:31:55 is aesthetically pleasing but there's not a lot of snow in the uk uh regardless it's like it's
01:32:00 damp it's dark it's cold it's windy it's not my kind of season and it's absolutely dreary and sad
01:32:09 and christmas when christmas comes around everyone decorates with shiny bright lights
01:32:15 and then there's happy holiday music playing as annoying and obnoxious as it is like i can't say
01:32:22 i hate it um and it's just like the whole place everywhere i go it's all just like bright and
01:32:30 shiny and happy and all lit up everyone's in the mood and it's just i like how christmas looks i
01:32:37 like i like being outside on christmas i like that whole part of it 100 what always hits me though
01:32:43 it's like straight after the new year is at least in the fainia and i guess in uk as well straight
01:32:49 after a new year is like all the festivities and everyone takes down their decorations and
01:32:54 be back to the mundane and then i realize how absolutely sad and quiet and dreary the rest of
01:33:00 the winter is because like nothing nothing of importance or significance or festive happens
01:33:06 up until like i don't know spring and i mean you got valentine's day that's everybody loves valentine's
01:33:14 to heck with it it's still in all i guess it's february so now that's not spring but you know it's
01:33:22 still like a whole a whole month of nothing and except for sadness and sockiness and it's just
01:33:29 it's really sad and and and i miss christmas during that month see mage the interesting thing that
01:33:34 is like you're missing the american perspective right because in america what happens is that uh
01:33:41 there's there's nothing like that we've we've all realized that this is a problem and we did
01:33:46 what we always do to solve problems in america which is throw consumerism at it so and in america
01:33:51 as soon as halloween's over it's instantly christmas the next day until christmas and then once
01:33:56 christmas over it's valentine's day but the post the post the post christmas the post christmas
01:34:01 time is still a doldrum yeah exactly yeah i was talking about as soon as but like we also have like
01:34:09 the halloween christ christmas like overlap yeah i don't mind i think it's funny um i don't mind
01:34:17 winter i don't mind cold that much most of the time it's the worst i love it it makes me really
01:34:24 happy i i'm i'm i'm down with it being cold oh god never you know 75 of the time if you want to
01:34:30 know my exact unaltered raw opinions on winter turn on the scott pilgrim the game track another
01:34:37 winter and that's exactly how i feel every single moment i'm out in the cold which is to say
01:34:43 it's astounding and i love it god i wish i being in new england i wish i could be you because every
01:34:50 time it's not i'm i'm i'm fucking like three miles from you right now that's why i said because
01:34:57 i'm also in new england i wish i could be you okay yeah yeah yeah i wanted i want to be on your
01:35:04 wavelength we're trapped in the same house together now tom you and me are just some
01:35:08 fucking brown hairs yeah oh ben i'm so glad you've adopted it yeah yeah tom you're just a
01:35:13 fucking brown hair jeez brown-haired white people we can't can't deal with that guys yeah do you
01:35:20 do you do you like smell like seasons yes i i smell season i like the smell which seasons um no i don't
01:35:29 um i don't go outside enough the weather seasons like you go outside and after it's rained it has
01:35:35 this very specific smell that's true yeah yeah but that's like a little bit different i can like
01:35:40 seasons have their own specific smells like i go outside and i can smell winter and it's like
01:35:45 this crisp fresh air and it's it's so good well i don't smell that but i do feel that
01:35:52 like like i can feel it on my skin like ah yes that's that's like sharp but not quite sharp enough
01:35:57 to cut me and draw blood i think i know what you're talking about i have a terrible sense of smell
01:36:02 and my nose is constantly plugged up and my life is terrible we don't want to know why i have a high
01:36:07 pitched voice it's not because i'm naturally gay though that it does play into it just my nose

01:37:48 is that i'm quit i'm quitting keto for christmas oh i ate i ate croissants today
01:37:55 croissants you're so so for croissants i'm getting well they were they had no they had chocolate
01:38:03 in them they had chocolate in them so you see you might think you might think that me the ultimate
01:38:10 human core artisan that i am the the ultimate anti-keto anti-utilitarian uh of food choices
01:38:17 might applaud you and be like wow i'm so happy for you but no i'm just disgusted that you do this
01:38:23 perverse degenerative lifestyle and then don't even stick to it you haven't even just fully converted
01:38:28 to being a cherry for like two days you're now just so goosey goosey what am i gonna what am i
01:38:34 gonna show up to family christmas and be like uh no i can't eat a fucking eggnog because it's got
01:38:42 sugar in it did i tell you about my metabolism the vegans would do what does eggnog taste like
01:38:48 i wonder oh i love eggnog you don't you don't know egg we don't have eggnog over here we don't
01:38:54 what i understand is that you you put an egg in a nog and you drink it it's a nog here's the thing
01:39:00 i have never i've never had like homemade eggnog or if i have i don't remember it i just you know
01:39:05 you can buy it in like hood fucking like like court in the hood yeah you can buy it and you
01:39:11 can buy it in like courts in the supermarket and it's fucking great man i love apple cider tea he
01:39:18 i'm doing what ben says he hates and that's talking about food even though he brought it up initially
01:39:22 look man my the status of my metabolism is everybody's business but my um ben just comes
01:39:33 up here with his sunglasses on and his dick out and his collar pops saying hey guys did you know
01:39:38 that i'm abandoning my ideals just thought you should know and he expects us to just get on all
01:39:45 fours and just beg for it but i'm not gonna do it ben i'm gonna say you you either you either die
01:39:50 heroes live long enough to yourself stop keto that's what you're doing this is a slippery slope
01:39:55 and you're about to abandon all that you care for just to get a fucking croissant he already did he
01:40:00 had the croissant they were delicious yeah it's not only that it's done it's done if you recall he
01:40:05 already abandoned keto on halloween when he had the pizza so this isn't like a new i ate so many
01:40:10 i ate so many airheads on halloween he abandoned keto yesterday he had some he had some sugar
01:40:17 i ate like one fucking starburst yeah we're some artisan some artisan candy you handed
01:40:23 guys guys speaking of candy at one point like in aziz store like they were stocking like those huge
01:40:29 actual marshmallows that you like put on a stick and over a fireplace and i bought them and they
01:40:33 were delicious and they don't sell them anymore and i was like this was my one chance and thankfully
01:40:38 i took this chance and i had those marshmallows and they were great how how big are we talking
01:40:42 really big like a like a like a like a like i don't know like a tennis bowl i guess someone like a
01:40:49 tennis huh okay these are huge the the hugest marshmallows you say that really say that again
01:40:56 say that again huge no i didn't have the magic you're exhaling at the time it was once in a lifetime
01:41:04 it's one we've got to move on yeah you cut it on tape though so you can read it's true we can
01:41:08 relive that on at our leisure yeah yeah are we doing questions are we doing voicemails voicemail
01:41:14 time yeah it's voicemail right now all right all right all right speaking of being a shit person
01:41:23 we've got some fucking asshole doing something terrible he's trying to make his cat vegan let's
01:41:29 listen to this no i call to get your input on a grave moral quandary you see i'm shifting into
01:41:35 veganism because i feel uncomfortable making the moral distinction between animals we keep as pets
01:41:40 and those who are born into factory farms loser you say that i love animals but among the animals
01:41:45 that i love is the house cat an obligate carnivore whose nutritional needs are only supplemented by
01:41:50 animal products additionally according to the 10 seconds of research i've put into the subject
01:41:55 most commercially available vegan cat foods do a horrible job of fulfilling their dietary needs
01:41:59 and are very unhealthy and harmful for the cat in 100 years when the revolutionaries overthrow
01:42:05 the meat industry and the world is tossed into utter vegan chaos will probably create an appropriate
01:42:10 substitute but for now i'm reminded of the vilification of goblins as a race that can only
01:42:15 how long is this voicemail making them an objectively evil force and forced to grapple
01:42:21 with the question do i deny my convictions and therefore justify any act that goes against
01:42:26 my moral convictions including murder or do i embrace my utilitarian doing and strangle my
01:42:32 sister's cat for the greater good all right here's the deal if animals can't be vegan
01:42:40 if you're if you have a pet if you own a pet and it needs to eat human flesh and you're not okay
01:42:47 with giving it human flesh then you shouldn't have that pet don't kill it obviously just give it to
01:42:53 someone else wait who said it needs to eat human flesh well i'm just making a metaphor comparison
01:42:58 like like other people can relate to the idea of not feeding their pet human flesh if it needs
01:43:03 that here here's the fucking deal dude cats again as you said are carnivores you you cannot get them
01:43:10 fucking some kitschy quirky vegan cat food that will kill them and fuck them up don't do it you
01:43:19 absolute idiot so the only choices are to get rid of that cat through either murder or through
01:43:26 trading bartering but but or to just kill yourself if you if which is if you if you own a cat and you
01:43:33 feed it meat you are contributing to the meat industry that's what he said like he has to
01:43:39 choose between his ideals and his cat he's really he's really struck on something important here
01:43:44 give the cat to a good loving home that they won't that will actually care about them yeah exactly
01:43:49 or just or just put it outside and close but here's but here's the thing if you can if you give the
01:43:55 cat and close the door if you give the cat to somebody else you're also contributing to the
01:43:59 meat industry because you're enabling the sales of meat products to continue well why don't you
01:44:04 just shoot everybody in the fucking so that's what i'm saying vegans need to just kill everybody
01:44:08 or kill themselves stop thinking about it this but if you own the cat but if you own the cat you're
01:44:16 and and you don't want to help the meat industry you are you are being complicit by your cat ownership
01:44:21 in in all right perpetuate this wasn't even a real question why are we giving it an answer
01:44:26 this guy was obviously trolling all of us and we're following okay here's the real i think it's
01:44:30 a real i have more i foolishly have more faith in our audience than that okay i don't know like i'm
01:44:38 trying to say made a goblin slayer google vegan cat food and give it to your cat because it's a bad
01:44:42 idea and don't do it and also yeah i think i think the takeaway here that i believe is probably true
01:44:49 is that if you don't believe in the meat industry and you're not willing to support it i don't think
01:44:52 you can own a cat yeah i mean you have to find unless you're gonna like unless you're gonna
01:44:57 like be catching mice for it or whatever and feeding it to you so unless you're gonna do like
01:45:01 grass roots cat but that's like that seems like even worse let's let it be an out there just let
01:45:05 it be an outdoor cat and hunt for itself cats do that true yeah that's true hey just invite rats
01:45:11 into your house i'll be the first thing to do is is that one of the reasons i don't think it's
01:45:15 there's probably not the only reason but one of the reason he stayed for being a vegan so he doesn't
01:45:19 like that there's no difference between the animals that are like house pets and the ones that are
01:45:25 being killed on mass and i don't know i guess i don't understand like why that's weird for some
01:45:32 animals we just like more like i don't think humans like like cows that much you think they're cute
01:45:38 it's like dogs are smarter than dogs generally we kill pigs and we don't kill dogs the the biggest
01:45:44 problem i have with this line of thinking is the idea that animals are a group that have
01:45:49 anything to do with one another like we group them together as animals uh for convenience and
01:45:56 we invented that group to say that all animals deserve rights is like all like all animals
01:46:02 deserve the same treatment is like saying all things like you could you could extrapolate it
01:46:09 further and further to late to two other things some people actually do it to like plants as well
01:46:14 and then they die instantly because there's nothing they can eat right i mean that is the
01:46:19 closer to meat than plants i heard that interesting is that that must be why they're so delicious
01:46:27 i'm saying okay listen i'm doing i'm i'm i'm on tape being pro animal however i'll maybe that
01:46:35 weird if you ate a dog i mean you know people know i would eat a dog if you offered me if you
01:46:40 offered me some dog i would eat it it that's why why is that weird mage i'm not trying to be edgy
01:46:47 here why is that why is that i know i know it's it's kind of like a i know when you think about
01:46:52 it it's a bit of a double standard yada yada i don't know i don't like thinking about eating dogs
01:46:56 though it's like it's i once saw like a show that like i think it's like an extreme factor and like
01:47:01 all you had to do was like eat an egg but then the egg was an unborn little baby duck or something
01:47:06 and it's a delicacy somewhere and i just i couldn't stomach it it's just well the like i said it before
01:47:14 like pigs pigs pigs are smarter than dogs and they're like they're they're like more
01:47:20 fucking emotional and like until intellectual and are just like cerebrally better and more
01:47:25 complete as beings than dogs are just but because they're ugly you know we think it's
01:47:31 we think it's gross to kill a dog and eat it but we just fucking have a lot of dogs doing
01:47:36 i think it's just because it's not fair it's bullshit it is not fair um i i support dog
01:47:42 treating animals well before like it's even i mean i don't you know the reason dogs are like
01:47:51 weird to eat uh like generally is because for millennia they were useful for us for like hunting
01:48:00 and and being like a you know a friendly associate to help uh to do stuff around the
01:48:06 tribal camps it's like why are you eating your gun yeah it's like it's like eating your gun
01:48:10 and they don't have a lot of meat on them and they're more lean it's like why would you eat that
01:48:14 when you can have this big fat fuck who's full of meat it just makes so much more sense to eat that
01:48:19 guy so we do that because it's sensible we we bred pigs and cows to be well yes we are meaty
01:48:24 and delicious and we bred dogs to be you know useful no yeah i mean they or whatever we'll
01:48:30 start it off pretty useful in terms of like running around and stuff but like this we did all that
01:48:35 stuff because it was like handy and like efficient for for everyone and then as soon as we like didn't
01:48:41 need to survive we started thinking like you know like things were said in their ways dogs were now
01:48:47 things that were our friends and pigs and cows we eat but now that we don't need to survive we
01:48:53 don't think about like the efficiency in the we're too emotional because we can afford to be emotional
01:48:59 we can afford to not live a meat eating lifestyle even though in the past that we would probably
01:49:04 just starve to death this all all i'm saying is i eat pig i don't care dogs and cats dumber than
01:49:13 pigs qed if i would eat a dog or a cat because it would be a hypocrite not to he here's my here's
01:49:20 my deal i'm you know it's unfortunate that we are we are being so mean to these animals you know
01:49:28 mean but as a human i can eat meat my ancestor ate me it's pretty human core to eat me and there's
01:49:37 one thing i care about most in this world it's about being a human so you want me to stop being a human
01:49:44 i'll kill you so don't ever bring me this vegan shit ever again in my fucking face if you want me
01:49:49 to stop eating me and roasting over a fire kill yourself humans humans don't need me they can get
01:49:55 by without it sure they can they can they can be fine are you are you are would you say it's not
01:50:00 human core go out and hunt a big wilder beast are you saying that's not human core that's pretty
01:50:04 human core okay it's pretty human but you know there's there's probably lots of ways to be human
01:50:09 core you know like uh uh uh raising a cornfield and plowing it with your with your uh domesticated
01:50:16 ox munchy and making millet out of it is pretty human core also to play devil's advocate munchy
01:50:21 what's what's more human core than going out of rate to specifically not eat you could what other
01:50:27 species does that but a human you would say being vegans the most human core thing you can be
01:50:33 that's fair i'm saying you know this this discussion ties right back in to my two
01:50:38 essential factors of being a human it's you have to eat bread and own a dog and you know
01:50:45 the two worst decisions you could make in your entire life agreed if you don't have those and
01:50:50 you're not a human uh and and you know if you eat your dog you'll still be a human but you know
01:50:55 what you should have owned it instead that's my feelings we're gonna play the next one no this
01:50:59 guy is a little bit hard to understand but just brace yourself attention all right you know what
01:51:06 you should do you should ask the fans which topics are our favorites and maybe one or twice a year
01:51:12 you should do an episode we'll just talk about that a continuation of that for example i just
01:51:17 love you guys rambling about how your fitness life is going what's dieting taking how i can
01:51:26 improve my life for example i love that fucking nate recipe for the cereal sometimes i do this
01:51:33 and i love it i just love getting fitness shit from you guys are you also really listening to the
01:51:38 wrong podcast about video game experiences that you had and stuff like that so yeah just
01:51:44 do a continuation of some things some things we love them guys want to hear more oh we'll be the
01:51:51 best oh please do that i would love you forever i i is this ironic i can't tell no i well i mean
01:51:58 i assume it isn't because uh people do like um things i i feel like this is something we could
01:52:08 try and implement which is not necessarily having a hard line topic of discussion um but to have
01:52:14 like little corners like in hello internet like a regular reoccurring thing that they can bring up
01:52:21 we can bring up every so often relating to a specific uh topic such as fitness like ben you
01:52:28 just do it um anyway you bring up keto a lot but like if people like that it could be like that's
01:52:36 this will be like oh it's the food out like not the hour but like the food call like segments
01:52:41 like we have played little jingles at the beginning of our segment like doing is the fuck why don't we
01:52:45 do that why don't we do that why don't i have that queued up why don't i have a little keto jingle
01:52:51 that i play when i fucking mention keto i can't believe i'm so fucking dumb that i haven't done
01:52:57 that already i can't i can't believe either that you have never thought about having segments like
01:53:01 ben how we never listened to it before it's just that there's nothing like we can talk about
01:53:05 consistently about it is your only experience with podcasts this podcast that you record
01:53:13 no okay well well but not every in fact most podcasts i listen to don't have segments
01:53:19 most of the podcasts i listen to have segments so it seems weird to have someone not be familiar
01:53:23 with the idea i mean i am familiar with the idea as i think should be clear okay um um
01:53:30 but yeah i think i think that could be be pretty cool something we should probably
01:53:35 maybe we should run like a poll maybe we should i don't know have like what is your favorite
01:53:39 procrastinator recurring topic or i don't know i don't like ask for that right now the number one
01:53:46 result would be monchi going to college i guarantee you for the meme well no no i think nobody i think
01:53:52 people are against people hate hearing about that or no maybe that's just us that hate talking
01:53:57 i hate talking about it i hate that i just brought it up right now i hate talking about it
01:54:01 people tell me people would ask for comment or rules three is what is what we've had people
01:54:05 already asked about okay let's do that again so i can completely not have the same opinion that i
01:54:10 did last time because i completely disagree with how i thought before i mean i think i think that
01:54:15 would be interesting now that the dust is settled i don't think i have anything else to say about
01:54:19 it i think two is stretching it she too was stretching i think the problem with two is that
01:54:24 comment or rules i talked to digi about this at one point i said comment or rules one no i think
01:54:28 was monchi i said this comment or rules one was ironic and funny and we were having a good like
01:54:33 joke about it i like we were like we're kind of serious but not really taha he he this is funny
01:54:37 comment or rules two everyone was angry and we were like being like legit about it and i was very
01:54:43 confused being on that episode because i thought it was gonna be more taha he he but it was not it
01:54:47 was very much like comment or rules two was like we're drawing the lines in the sand and i was like
01:54:51 i thought we were supposed to really want what do they want to drink monsters for oh
01:54:56 shit monsters for baby sign me the fuck up that's a segment we got to have the monsters for a
01:55:06 segment for now on every episode for ever for a segment monster ever we got we got we got to
01:55:13 get we got to get we got to get six tin to make a little jingle for it or something we could have
01:55:18 like a whole jingle episode or we have so many different jingles and and topic things we could

01:58:42 because let me tell you me gene i'm the next number one fan and defender of the character of
01:58:47 tommy oliver from the mighty morpher power rangers jen and it's recently come to my attention dude
01:58:52 that's one of your members not only runs a channel under the name of tommy oliver but it's its legal
01:58:59 name brother and he's not even a power ranger fan creator meaning toom if you are listening to this
01:59:08 this is your one and only warning brother you need to delete that channel and legally change
01:59:15 your name dude or start making some power ranger videos man i'm gonna body slam you and put you
01:59:23 in the act so hard your freaking head will pop off dude and then i'll spear you through a table
01:59:28 brother i mean serious business here mean gene i've already taken one youtuber down brother
01:59:34 oh which one you got one month to get your act together jack a lot of times
01:59:41 as that the gauntlet's been i mean that was definitely a challenge but like i gotta say first
01:59:46 of all thank you for the gracious window of opportunity you know most people go with like a 24
01:59:50 hour did you make a power rangers video at some point i did i did do like a half-assed halloween
01:59:57 episode where i was reviewing the power rangers halloween episode which was just a wrapping
02:00:01 pumping guy which was funny uh so i guess technically i have made power rangers content
02:00:07 and i do already win the bet or the win the challenge beforehand you've gone away from
02:00:14 your your power tuber yeah yeah you've won you've already won the only question is is
02:00:21 tommy oliver aka macho man randy savage aka the green ranger going to kick your ass anyway um
02:00:27 that's the only question left i guess so i guess we're just i could have to wait an entire month
02:00:32 now to find out i don't even have to like do anything i just have it's already happened
02:00:37 yeah the we have the gears that have been set in motion yeah so it's time to watch them back
02:00:42 lean back and that's the easiest challenge i've ever participated in i just be like but by the
02:00:46 way it's done this is this is unrelated but but it factors into you yesterday when me been in kazi
02:00:53 we're all hanging out in boston kazi brought up a very interesting thing that you do on instagram
02:00:57 which which me and ben left really hard at wait what i never knew about i didn't even know you
02:01:04 were on instagram because i don't use it yeah uh we really enjoy the hey what's up guys just go
02:01:10 back from the gym right for another q and a sesh just you know post your comments and we are just
02:01:16 okay okay uh kazi made it sound like like to hear her tell it like every day you go to the gym
02:01:23 whoa and then you get home from the gym and you pop on instagram and say sup guys just home from
02:01:29 the gym for a little q and a well that that is literally only i mean i only do the q and a's
02:01:35 on friday that's why it's called q and a friday and and i've only ever done it back from the gym
02:01:41 that one day so i mean if by every day you mean one day the day that happened to be brought up
02:01:49 then yes i do it every day tom it was hard to believe so we had to pull up one and like the
02:01:58 very first video we saw on your instagram stories you saying ah i just got back from the gym guys
02:02:04 q and a i don't know it just left me scratched in my head like what is it wait how many questions
02:02:12 are there when he goes to the gym and that is a q and a every day oh god i i i wish i had the
02:02:18 self-confidence to think i was worth having a q and a every day i'd probably be so much
02:02:23 further in life if i cared about myself that much i thought it was some sort of like marketing the
02:02:27 community management thing where every day after the gym you're just so pumped up you're like yeah
02:02:31 i just can't wait to answer some questions like you're on the treadmill and you're just going
02:02:34 fast and fast like i gotta get home so i can read my fucking q and a question i like this fictional
02:02:39 facsimile of me that exists now and i want to become closer to it i've you've given me a goal to
02:02:44 aspire to it's legendary that's linking the description to tom yeah q and a
02:02:54 um all right okay so we were talking a lot about discord wars and i have no idea what the genesis
02:02:59 of these discord wars were but there were a lot of voicemail so i picked two here for you to uh
02:03:04 some some both sides of a of a hunggoing war so this is like keyblade how do you do i'm here as
02:03:13 a representative of the market how do fan discord i've been hearing a lot about this pcp discord
02:03:19 war that's brewing and i'm here as the market mod to officially declare our neutrality in this
02:03:26 conflict all right i agree remember what the markets can do for you well what you can do to
02:03:33 market yourself all right that is all the whole problem with market how do being a part of this
02:03:38 is that market how do is not technically a pcp product right because i do it with my friend
02:03:43 mad who has nothing to do with the pcp so it's pcp adjacent but i mean you're on it and you're on
02:03:49 the pcp so it's pcp it's pcp adjacent yeah you know it's totally pcp adjacent but it's not pcp
02:03:56 itself is arm retrieval pcp adjacent or is it a pcp spinoff i would have is it a pcp is it a
02:04:03 pc property that's a good term copyright you know that's a good question i guess i wouldn't consider
02:04:09 it i want it because it doesn't i would call it's adjacent but it's about as adjacent as you can
02:04:14 possibly fucking get yeah without being incorporated yeah it's like it's arm retrieval is like on the
02:04:20 level of adjacency of like the give and take streams i was like i don't think that's really a pcp
02:04:26 thing but it is arm retrieval is not pcp adjacent it's like a pcp spinoff it's like it's evolved as
02:04:32 a product as a result of it whereas market how do wasn't entirely separately uh you conceived
02:04:39 endeavor market how do is yeah it's like a totally separate thing that just sort of got entangled it
02:04:45 was caught in the orbit yeah while they're not a huge section of the viewer base there are there is
02:04:51 a considerable amount of people on the arm retrieval fandom who have not are not like pcp heads
02:04:56 and they just are homestuckers and they just found it through you know like you know i'm stuck
02:05:02 yeah yeah real jealous yeah that's what you gotta do well about this discord war
02:05:08 i hadn't heard about this discord war but i guess they better whip the hellfire hamlet up into a
02:05:12 frenzy there's killers what are you talking about there are well there are killers and there are
02:05:19 people and there are like people that were there before rfck that have no that are sort of killers
02:05:24 in spirit but have no like real gang affiliation ben how are there people in your discord server
02:05:30 that you have not bullied into playing the game i don't understand because i'm a fucking nice guy
02:05:36 man yeah i'm gonna finish last as always yeah and that's why what are you like you're slightly
02:05:42 shit you're slightly ahead of the leaderboard there is because i'm a nice guy i really want to
02:05:46 like draw up like a map of where all these discord countries reside spatially so that we can have
02:05:51 like a game of thrones that would be sick and i want you to do it well well i mean we have like
02:05:56 like a bubble infographic can we have like a bubble infographic of discord servers
02:06:02 you know what i'm talking about like an interconnecting web of them oh yes perfect
02:06:07 would we need like to actually get dated for that or uh you just just make it up you just make it
02:06:14 look convincing and i'll be happy all right we've heard from some neutral now to see someone on like
