00:00:00 Hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It is January 24th, 2021, and it's the new episode.
00:00:17 I'm Ben Saint, and also there's Gibbontake. It's been one week since the last PCP.
00:00:25 I lost my watch at a party once. An hour later, I saw some guy stepping on it while he was sexually
00:00:39 harassing a woman. Infuriated, I went up to him, punched him, and broke his nose. Nobody does that
00:00:45 to a woman, not on my watch. YouTube.com slash Gamers Tavern Show. Tell your friends even if
00:01:03 they're imaginary. I didn't see that punchline coming, so I'll give you that one. I think I heard
00:01:11 that one before. I don't know where. Probably one of my videos. Maybe. Don't tell me you reuse
00:01:20 material. I would never do that. The greatest comedians tell a joke one time ever and then throw
00:01:27 it out and never repeat it under any circumstances. That's what the professionals do. I've been watching
00:01:34 these videos of Stuart Lee, this comedian. He's a British comedian and he's like,
00:01:40 I'd never heard of him before because he hates the whole TV scene. He just likes doing shows,
00:01:50 which means he's better because he's not stupid and lame and on TV and all that shit.
00:01:58 So what does he do? He sells DVDs of his clubs, clubs and stadiums and stuff. He's quite popular,
00:02:09 but he doesn't do the TV circuit of being on panel shows and whatever.
00:02:19 But I see sometimes, I see a bit of his where it's like, I know this bit. I've watched this bit in a
00:02:25 different video, in a different DVD special. I've seen this bit before. I think he sucks now. I don't
00:02:31 like him and in fact, I'm going to unsubscribe to this random YouTuber who isn't him.
00:02:36 Absolutely. So he reuses material too?
00:02:41 Yeah. When I hear a band play a song a second time, I'm like, that's it. You guys are hacks.
00:02:47 You guys are over. How can you reuse material? This is blatant. You're literally plagiarizing
00:02:53 yourself. Yeah. When I listen to an album, I'm like, I've listened to this part before.
00:03:01 Skips to the new part. Skips to the new part. It's like each song is like a piece of thin ice
00:03:06 over a lake and you can skate on it like only so many times before it cracks and it's no longer
00:03:12 usable. You have to skate on other songs. Yeah. I need to get some new material because...
00:03:17 I have many people are saying this. I need to get new material because this cotton shirt just
00:03:22 isn't working out for me. I suggest Rayon. Big Rayon fan. Underrated. Underrated textile there.
00:03:35 Somebody messaged me after last week's episode to ask me like, hey, I loved your font recommendations.
00:03:43 Do you have any more fonts you recommend? And I was like, no. I named all the good ones.
00:03:49 You mean you were still doing that? There are no more. Because I think you were recommending
00:03:54 fonts on one of the last episodes I was on. I think we got a voicemail where someone was like
00:04:01 very pointedly asking about like, what are you guys favorite fonts? So is this going to be like
00:04:07 the circumcision thing? No. Font corner. I don't know. I don't think font
00:04:14 choice. I don't think things like kerning are like as emotionally charged as the circumcision
00:04:21 debate. Well, I don't know. Some people get pretty serious about fonts. What are the different types
00:04:28 of like, there's like the ones where the Times New Roman where the like a T has little bits on the
00:04:36 end of it. And then there's one's Serif and then non-Serif. Serif and Sans Serif where Comic Sans
00:04:45 gets its name. Yeah. Like where'd you fall on the Serif Sans Serif debate? Oh, I'm a big Serif guy.
00:04:55 Big Serif energy over here. I always liked that as well. When it came to like drawing,
00:05:01 like if there was like a drawing I was doing and it involved letters, I would always do the fanciest
00:05:06 possible because then it would be like fancier. I mean, as many bells and whistles as possible.
00:05:13 If you're handwriting and you add Serifs, like that means you, that means you really gave a
00:05:18 shit. Like you were like, how can I up the presentation? Speaking of, oh my god, you know
00:05:24 what would be, okay, I actually received a handwritten letter from Christine Weston Chandler.
00:05:30 Whoa, that's a big deal. This is, okay, this is funny. I, okay, I mentioned in the PCP chat,
00:05:39 Gabe, I think you saw that like, okay, on, on Twitter, in Twitter DMs, Chris messaged me to say
00:05:47 like, hey, I bought this crystal. It's a piece of blue hemi-morphite from Arizona, basically
00:05:55 because like, oh, it's just like slime podrans from the Endless War, right? Yeah. And she literally
00:06:04 fucking sent me the podrans. She sent me the piece of hemi-morphite. It's sitting on my,
00:06:09 I guess I should probably post a picture of it.
00:06:13 Dude, you're literally pen pals.
00:06:17 I guess so. So I told, I told Chris like, cool, if you send me that, I'll send you like some
00:06:22 pins and a slime coin. So I got to get that in the mail to her. But, but she wrote me a letter
00:06:27 and I actually haven't read the letter yet. So I guess I should, I think I'll just read it now.
00:06:32 Yeah, why not? Here it is.
00:06:36 To Ben saying, feel free to read on your next live stream or whatever. So I guess that's this.
00:06:45 Dear Ben, wait a minute, sorry, I'm mixed up because Christine is not Christine. Christine
00:06:51 is actually Sonichu right now. Sonichu is actually inhabiting the body of Christine while I suppose
00:06:57 Christine is in C197. When you got to get all the letters. So this is actually a letter from Sonichu.
00:07:04 So this is Sonichu's actual handwriting you have. Like this is literally, yes, I literally,
00:07:09 I literally holding in my hand a letter from Sonichu, of the Sonichu comic book fame.
00:07:18 What a world, am I right? That's quite an artifact you've got there.
00:07:22 It is. Dear Ben, here is a lovely chunk of hemimorphite, aka a podron of slime. Obviously genuine.
00:07:32 Purchase from the minerals and mystics, formerly crystal connection, of Charlottesville, Virginia,
00:07:37 mine from Arizona, in the vicinity of Nlacocam. And Christine has personally verified it as
00:07:43 1218's counterpart of a podron of slime. This podron has been near this body for a few days
00:07:50 so it is energized and blessed. Oh, it's been energized by Christine's body.
00:07:58 Eminem also gave me a bit of a bit of stickum and a pedestal. Oh, okay. It's the thing that it's
00:08:05 like sitting on. Eminem also gave me a bit of stickum and a pedestal, which I felt would be
00:08:10 better off for and with you. You may even put your name on it. Ben quote, Ben Saints podron
00:08:18 or what you like. Enjoy it and stay safe and well. Sonichu, January 18th, 2021. And Sonichu is
00:08:26 written in a scribbly sort of lightning bolt kind of a script there. So bear it into your face.
00:08:35 Now you're protected from COVID now.
00:08:39 Well, in slime and punishment, in Christine's side pages, images of it,
00:08:49 Chris Chan Sonichu takes the slime podron and I guess energizes it and gives it back to phantom
00:08:57 horn. And this is in the beta timeline. And in the beta timeline, phantom form is given this
00:09:02 energized podron and it causes him to grow a sort of ethereal quote unquote phantom unicorn horn
00:09:10 that he can use like some approximation of real unicorn magic through and in and in the image,
00:09:16 when Chris when Chris Chan is giving the podron back to phantom horn, the podron is blue, like
00:09:21 it's very clearly blue. So I was like, okay, she charged it up with blue energy, right? Because
00:09:25 recently she posted pictures of Sonichu and Chris Chan. But they since they've switched bodies,
00:09:31 they have like an aura energy around them. So Chris Chan's body has this yellow energy aura,
00:09:35 because it's got Sonichu in it. And Sonichu's got this blue energy aura, because it's got
00:09:38 Christine in it. So it's like, okay, yeah, she put her fucking aura energy into the crystal.
00:09:42 So it's blue, of course. But then I reply to her like, oh, just like the the blue podron. And
00:09:48 she's like, um, actually, Christine simply use the wrong marker to color it. Make of that what
00:09:56 you will. And I'm like, oh, even Christine makes a mistake. So that was just a mistake.
00:10:00 So that's just a mistake, even though it just makes way more sense for the podron to be blue.
00:10:05 Okay, she said like, make of it what you will. So I'm just going to assume that yes, yes, it did
00:10:10 make the podron blue, because I literally had the pin manufacturers like manufacture a small
00:10:16 quantity of like alternate color blue podrons. So I just feel silly if that if that were a waste
00:10:23 of time. So I had like, I had like, I literally forgot that I got that until just now.
00:10:32 And that's pretty cool. You know, pretty, pretty cool. I guess maybe I'll hang that up.
00:10:37 Maybe I'll tuck that in behind the, you know, the page of liquid Sonichu being or liquid Chris
00:10:44 being reborn in the fucking hell womb or whatever the one I have on my wall. So I guess you two are
00:10:51 on good terms again, because I remember a while back, there was like a bit of an issue
00:10:57 or something. She was, yeah, she she was, she was mad at me merely for reporting the facts,
00:11:04 which is that in Lockecom did in fact go to war with quick bill. Yeah. And that the casualty,
00:11:10 the casualties were immense. But Christine refused to acknowledge it. And I guess that's just the
00:11:18 quick bill party line is to just not, not admit that any of that happened, but it did. You know,
00:11:23 I was there. I posted pictures, there was video evidence. There was a whole, there was a whole
00:11:29 body of work done about it in the, in the RFCK server for the contest, the quick, the war on
00:11:36 quick bill contest. So like it's, it's, it's Canon. I mean, it's indisputable. A whole body of work
00:11:42 of all the dead bodies, right? Yes, that's right. There are, there are stats too. There are, there
00:11:47 are body counts. Astronomically high ones, of course. Oh, that's, that's fine. You should,
00:11:57 you know what, if you're sending the, the coin and stuff, you should do a handwritten letter back
00:12:02 and actually like get a rapport going with Sonichu.
00:12:06 Um, you know, I, I had arranged like a sheet, like a little piece, like an image that would
00:12:15 explain like what each of the pins mean, like what, what they are images of. And then my
00:12:20 fucking printer broke. So like I couldn't print it. So I might just like send her that image when
00:12:25 she gets it so she can see it or whatever. Cause like she's not going to know what like
00:12:31 goo girls limited is. For instance. She might be a bigger fan than you think.
00:12:41 I don't. You know what? Maybe you're right. I choose to believe that you're right. You know what?
00:12:48 You know what? I wasn't kind of a shitty mood, but that, that really, that really perked me up.
00:12:54 I'm feeling chipper now. You're feeling chipper and you're not even chipped from shipping downs.
00:13:01 Die. Die, Gamers Tavern. Die. Oh, uh, by the way, I, um, want to mention something on here.
00:13:12 Uh, you can, uh, you, you can both call me, uh, Krono with a K instead of Gamers Tavern,
00:13:18 unless you want to continue. Okay. Gamers Tavern is up to you.
00:13:22 Krono? Sure. Yeah. Uh, Krono is a real name, I guess. Yeah, you've mentioned that before. I just
00:13:27 was in the habit. I was just in the habit of calling you Gamers Tavern, like I was in the habit
00:13:30 of calling Gib Hippo. Right. Um, that's a, okay. Krono, Krono it is. I mentioned that off the air,
00:13:37 I think one time, but I want to take the opportunity to mention it on the air. So, uh,
00:13:42 everybody knows, I guess a couple of thousand people might listen to this.
00:13:50 That's a, an old username I used to use back in, I think I first used it in 2001.
00:13:57 So I haven't, I haven't used it much lately, but I'm thinking of bringing it back, you know,
00:14:02 because, uh, embrace tradition and reject modernity. That's right. The, the, the
00:14:09 the extremely modern Gamers Tavern brand. It's not old, old, old, good, new, bad. It is. It is
00:14:17 bad. So just keep as far back as you possibly can. But that's been my, my philosophy for pretty
00:14:25 much my entire life. Um, man, I've been, um, okay. Let me tell, I've been, I've been really
00:14:38 struggling with Noita. Noita is so fucking hard. And then I, I guess Vosh just beat it. Like, I
00:14:48 haven't, I haven't, I haven't watched Vosh in a while. I didn't know that he or anyone was playing
00:14:53 Noita, but I just see a, I see a, he, I just happened to see a tweet from him that's like,
00:14:58 I'm really proud of my first Noita win. And it made me really mad. It made me really mad
00:15:04 that Vosh beat Noita before I did. Do you care to elaborate on what this is for anyone who doesn't
00:15:11 know? No, no, no, it's a, it's a roguelite or roguelike. I don't know. Yeah. One of them.
00:15:19 Yeah. You jump into a game.
00:15:22 I had a really good, I had Craig fucking die, Craig. You piece of shit. I had a really good
00:15:29 game like earlier today, where I had like a pretty good synergy going where I had, I managed to get
00:15:36 a buff that would like turn a project, when you shot a projectile, it would make the projectiles
00:15:41 shoot fireballs out to the left and right. And I put that on a wand that would shoot a like bouncy
00:15:46 projectile. So the projectile would go out and it would bounce. And so it would like persist for
00:15:51 a while bouncing around. And even after it was bouncing, it would still just keep shooting
00:15:55 fireballs that like, um, it was pretty fucking, it was, it was, that was pretty fucking good.
00:16:01 It didn't actually do that much damage, but it was like a lot of bang for your buck.
00:16:04 What an important thing is that it looked cool, right?
00:16:09 Uh, though, I mean, the cool looking ones just literally just kill you when you use them.
00:16:14 They just like fucking explode and you die. I had, I found one wand that had a spell on it
00:16:20 that I'd never seen before. And the spell was like, turns everything around you into blood.
00:16:26 And I used it and it literally just turned my body into blood and I died. My whole body was just
00:16:32 became blood. So it's like, I don't know exactly what these things are going to do.
00:16:39 No, you don't really know what the spells do until you use them.
00:16:43 They like randomly generated effects like they can stack and mix in interesting ways.
00:16:49 The spells are, there's a pre, there is a particular list of spells.
00:16:54 But you will, you find wands that have slots and the slots will have like
00:16:59 semi random spells in the slots and the slots, some, some wands are like randomized. Like you'll,
00:17:07 you'll shoot them and it will like pick a random slot to fire a spell from.
00:17:11 But some, some wands are non shuffle, which means that the spells progress in a linear fashion.
00:17:17 They go slot one, slot two, slot three, slot four. And so you can build things. So like,
00:17:22 you could maybe put a like modifier in the first slot that's like, okay, cast the next two spells.
00:17:28 But then, you know, and then maybe you put a spell, but then in the second spell that that
00:17:33 double slot cast is going to cast, you put like another modifier that's like, okay,
00:17:38 that one make it like a double branch spell. And then so that in that second pathway actually
00:17:42 branches out into two more spells. So you can build these like, these like logic
00:17:47 machines that like do like a chain of spells that all modify each other.
00:17:52 So spell slots is like a material, right?
00:17:56 Um, yeah, kind of. Yeah, yeah, more or less. But like the spells are on the wands. So like,
00:18:05 you're not you, you don't have mana that you cast spells with like the individual wands have like
00:18:10 a mana pool and like a mana regeneration rate. And like that affects like, like you might have
00:18:16 a wand that has like a really good fire rate and like, and stuff. And you put like a spell on it
00:18:22 and you're like machine gun. But if it's got like low mana or low regeneration rate, you like,
00:18:27 you'll run out and you won't actually be that useful, you know? So you kind of have to find
00:18:32 wands that work well. It's super fucking interesting. And it's so hard. I think I made it,
00:18:38 I think last night I had like one of my best runs yet. I made it to you start in the mines,
00:18:45 and then you go, no, no, you start in like the cab, the mines, and then you go to like the deeper
00:18:50 mines. And then you go to like this ice layer, and then there's a jungle layer. No, no, and then
00:18:56 there's like a vault, and then there's a jungle layer, and then there's like a second vault,
00:18:59 and I made it to that like the like second vault with all this high tech shit in it.
00:19:03 And I was like, this is only like a second time ever I've made it there. It was it was my best
00:19:07 run ever. It was pretty good. But I don't think I was even anywhere close to the end.
00:19:15 And it's very, very challenging. It's very challenging video game video game. Yes. The most
00:19:23 the most fun thing in Noida, in my opinion, is in the second level, the like the deeper mines
00:19:31 is if you get a spell that has the ability to like clear dirt or clear, um, yeah, like clear
00:19:38 materials out, and you just go around there and you look for like pockets of gold that
00:19:44 are buried in like the stone in the mines, and you can just like dig to them and just like
00:19:49 pick up the gold, and you just like go around and like collect as much gold as you can. So you
00:19:53 have a lot of money so that you can like buy better spells and like the in between zone like a
00:19:59 minecraft, right? Almost as if you are some kind of the minecraft. Yes. Dude, I've been playing
00:20:10 minecraft, and I've been playing minecraft as well as minecraft. Have you ever heard of
00:20:16 ever heard of X's adventures in minecraft? He was a let's play. Is X a person? X was his name.
00:20:26 I don't think his channel, his channel wasn't called that, but he is. I've heard of X's adventures
00:20:31 of whatever I've heard of Poo's adventures of. Yes, he's not winning the poo, unfortunately.
00:20:39 But he was like one of the first minecraft let's players that didn't take off
00:20:46 in like a gigantic way, but he's like beloved because it's like kind of the best when it was
00:20:53 new. You know, he was discovering the game and he was like learning and everyone else was like
00:20:57 learning with him, and so it was like a magical let's play, and it was really well produced.
00:21:02 He was a very thoughtful gamer rather than just screaming and jumping at stuff. He crafts
00:21:10 his let's play like it's a show that it's got narrative stakes, even though he is just recording
00:21:16 himself playing a game and he cuts it off at specific. It's just very well nicely made,
00:21:21 and he's been gone for 10 years. He has stopped doing minecraft 10 years ago, and people have
00:21:28 always wanted him to come back because I think the first playthrough, it got quite far, but then
00:21:35 he just sort of got bored because he died and it was far away and he lost a lot of stuff,
00:21:40 and he tried to look for it. That was just it? Yeah, I think it was before Beds. I think it was
00:21:46 before you could set your spawn point, so he was on a very, very long far away adventure and he
00:21:52 died and he lost everything. Just like real life? Yes, except he didn't in real life, he don't come
00:21:59 back. So real life is better? I suppose, if you die and lose all your stuff in real life
00:22:11 and you come back and you start again, you're like, I don't want to even think about that.
00:22:17 So this guy crafts his let's plays like that minecraft thing, right?
00:22:24 Oh yeah, he crafts it like a mine. He crafts it like a mine. Anyway, anyway,
00:22:32 he is cool and he's been gone for 10 years. He comes back very recently with Minecraft
00:22:38 let's play hardcore mode and he's doing it the same way as always and he was never like
00:22:44 a big speedrunner type gamer. He's always been sort of slow and methodical and a little bit
00:22:51 autistic in the way that he conducts his like, I noticed watching him, he's like,
00:22:58 he has to have his station, which always has like the furnace in a specific place
00:23:03 compared to where the crafting table is and the chest and then he like digs and it's very,
00:23:10 I don't know, soothing to watch. And I've been getting back into him
00:23:14 playing the game 10 years super nostalgic Minecraft let's play makes me want to play
00:23:19 Minecraft, even though at the time I was in a Minecraft binge, I was talking about Minecraft
00:23:24 not so long ago, doing a hardcore mode. Minecraft is so fucking good. I can't even imagine people
00:23:31 playing us a different game. It's so good. No, it is just Minecraft. No, it is just Minecraft
00:23:38 only instead of only each each individual pixels its own block. So it's better because it's more
00:23:44 granular, more blocks is more better. I guess that's that's more more blocks than Terraria then
00:23:50 because Terraria is blocks still have Terraria has multiple pixels in them.
00:23:55 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, much better, much better. It's much better than Terraria and much better.
00:24:02 Because I mean, think about it, right? Noida is only two dimensional. So, you know, theoretically,
00:24:09 the blocks, the small the already smaller and more granular blocks are only two dimensional. So
00:24:16 actually in a in a hypothetical 3d space, you could fit infinite amounts of them, right,
00:24:21 because they're infinitesimally small slivers of a three dimensional area. So there's actually
00:24:25 like infinitely better video game. Oh, yeah, that sounds like pretty solid logic. When they're not
00:24:31 Minecraft, I don't know. I think I think most games suck. It's fine. Some some people just like
00:24:40 less blocks. Some people just like fewer blocks. Some people are stupid. Yeah, good point. That's
00:24:46 okay. That's okay. You know what? Son, live and learn some some people live and learn.
00:24:57 Oh, see, Craig finally made it. Fuck you, Craig. Yeah, piece of shit. Well, I did upload a new video
00:25:05 recently. We mentioned that before. Did you crafted your own YouTube video? Yeah, exactly. Dude.
00:25:12 Oh, it all comes back to Minecraft. Everything always comes back to Minecraft.
00:25:22 Sure does. So what's the video? Your video was Mega Man zero four ending. You're like it was a
00:25:31 it was a speak video. It wasn't a let's play. Yeah, it's something new that I've never done before.
00:25:37 I'm not sure if it counts as an analysis video or not. I think it sort of does. It's like a mini
00:25:44 video essay sort of thing. Here is why I like this thing. Yeah, I wrote a script for it and I
00:25:52 recorded it and it was pretty easy to make because I didn't have to tell any jokes. That's the easiest.
00:25:58 That's the easiest. It's easy not to have to tell jokes, you know, it's a weight off my shoulders,
00:26:04 but I guess it's maybe good or maybe not. I'm not even sure if I want to promote it because I
00:26:11 don't know if it's good. I watched it. I kind of liked it. I'd never heard of Mega Man zero.
00:26:19 What? I've heard of Mega Man zero. I've never played. I mean, never played any other. I mean,
00:26:24 I feel like they'll even played Mega Man one. Am I crazy or did didn't you talk about this video
00:26:30 like last time you were on? No, because the last time I was on the video didn't exist.
00:26:40 Or did you just talk about the ending to Mega Man X4, but not this video? Yeah, maybe I talked
00:26:47 about the ending. The last time I think we were in a stream that wasn't on the PCP.
00:26:52 Oh, that might have been it. Yeah, that might have been it. I really liked the ending to Mega Man
00:26:57 zero four. So I got the idea of making a video explaining why I like it. And I uploaded two
00:27:04 videos, one of just the ending by itself and the other one of me talking about the ending.
00:27:11 Yeah, okay. Okay, I see. Mega Man zero is a fucking cool. I don't know. It's like
00:27:22 Mega Man. Okay, Mega Man X is more of like a spiritual sequel to Mega Man. It has like some
00:27:29 lore connections, but it's like not explicit. And it's sort of like up to you to decide what
00:27:35 the relationship is there. Mega Man zero is like a, it's like a direct sequel to Mega Man X. It's
00:27:42 almost just like, I guess it's not just like a straight continuation because Mega Man X did
00:27:46 continue. Mega Man zero is canonically just like the future of Mega Man X. Like super future, right?
00:27:54 Like, like, every super humanity is not even slightly the same as it was in Mega Man one.
00:28:00 I don't think there are any humans left in Mega Man. There are cyborgs or something.
00:28:05 There are humans in Mega Man zero. The plot of Mega Man zero is that the humans hated the
00:28:14 reploids and they wanted to get rid of all of them. So they found a society called Neo Arcadia
00:28:20 and they're hunting down reploids. Cool fucking name. God, the aesthetics of Mega Man zero is
00:28:26 a fucking cool. Yeah, it is pretty cool. So in the beginning, you joined the resistance group.
00:28:32 Yeah. And in the resistance group, you're actually fighting against the humans to
00:28:36 defend the reploids or the robots. Right. Right. Because the humans are actually
00:28:44 the bad guys. Because the reploids are basically just people. The reploids are just like most people
00:28:50 in this world, right? The reploids are just robotic versions of humans, I guess. Or rather,
00:28:55 they're robots that have free will. I don't know if I ever mentioned this, but there was a,
00:29:04 okay, me and, me and Munchy and Kazzy one time went to, because their school had a like comic
00:29:15 book creators club. And Munchy told me like, this is bad. He was like, I went to this club
00:29:22 and it sucked. And I was like, that's funny. Let's go. So we went to a meeting. We went to a meeting
00:29:30 of this kind of this like these college kids who were all like talking about their comic ideas.
00:29:36 And it was very much like it was it was a lot of most of the meeting was like basically
00:29:45 people describing their like going around the table like describing their OCs and all these
00:29:50 cool ideas they have for their comic that they haven't started making it. But they will.
00:29:56 I guess he's right. That does sound pretty bad. Yeah. It's, well, the funniest part.
00:30:02 And this was this was not the worst part, but it was probably the funniest. There was one guy
00:30:09 who is describing like the plot of like the comic series that he wants to make.
00:30:15 And he is like, okay, so it's set in the future. And you know, this technology is developed to
00:30:22 create this race of robots that have free will. And you know, there's tension between the sentient
00:30:29 robots and the humans. And some of those sentient robots decide that they're like robot supremacists
00:30:34 and they break off and they form like sort of a sort of a team of like renegades, you might call
00:30:40 them, you know, there's like a group that is like anti human. And then there's like, and then like
00:30:44 the protagonist is like, you know, a pro he's like a pro human, like he fights on behalf of the humans
00:30:49 to defend against these evil robots. And he's literally just describing the plot of Mega Man X.
00:30:54 And, and he's sitting there describing this, he's wearing a Mega Man X shirt. Like it's on his shirt
00:31:01 as he's describing it. And like, I'm just not gonna get we'll figure it out. Well, well, no,
00:31:06 I he redeemed himself a little bit because at the end, he he like he goes, he talks about all
00:31:12 this stuff. And then he's like, so you know, it's a lot like Mega Man X, like it's heavily
00:31:17 inspired by Mega Man X. Like, it's very simple to be obvious. So he like, he completely owned it,
00:31:23 which I respect. It's basically the same exact thing, except for one tiny detail that's different.
00:31:33 Yeah, basically, like, I know the feeling of like, like, I think sometimes like, ah, yeah,
00:31:38 I'm going to make this this thing. And it's it's basically like, exactly like home stuck, except
00:31:45 I wrote it. Yeah, yeah, basically, I can't think of anything I can't think of anything like it
00:31:51 would have in it. I just want to invent Riska myself.
00:31:57 Well, that's a noble endeavor.
00:32:01 Um, try to think if there was any other funny shit that happened.
00:32:08 No, that was the funniest part. It was I don't know. It was a bunch of crap.
00:32:11 But yeah, the Mega Man Zero series and X series are pretty cool. The stories of them are pretty cool.
00:32:18 But Mega Man Zero's story, I think is probably better and more fleshed out than X series.
00:32:26 Yeah, I mean, yeah, zero has zero is a little bit more plot centric. I think the X series,
00:32:34 you can play through Mega Man X and like almost not even notice that a plot is happening.
00:32:38 Yeah, the X series has pretty good lore, but there's not much plot to it.
00:32:44 Yeah, but the Mega Man Zero series has lore and plot.
00:32:49 It's very much like, okay, like I'm the fact that like, like the fact that it's called like
00:32:58 Neo Arcadia and like, I don't know, they talk about like this, like,
00:33:02 the place where like the humans like are like ruling from it has this sort of like weird like
00:33:07 religious aesthetic to it. Like it's like some kind of Holy Land or whatever.
00:33:10 Yeah, definitely. And like,
00:33:12 If you get an S rank in Mega Man Zero, they call you the Redeemer.
00:33:17 So fucking cool. I have such a sucker for that shit. The final when spoiler, big spoilers,
00:33:25 but when you like, okay, so like X is the leader of these evil humans who are like anti-reploids.
00:33:34 Yeah, but it's not actually X. It's X's body, but the like X's actual mind now exists in the form
00:33:42 of like a cyber elf, which is the sort of like disembodied like program that is sort of like a
00:33:48 spirit or whatever. And you can use cyber elves to like enhance your abilities and stuff in the game.
00:33:53 But like the real X is a cyber elf, but his but X's body is controlled by some new AI who thinks
00:33:58 he's the real X, but he's this fucking like a like reploid genocide fucking monster.
00:34:05 And when you fight him at the end of the first Mega Man Zero, he turns into this giant fucking
00:34:10 like robot like angel wing creature and just is like fucking blah. Yeah, it's pretty great.
00:34:17 It's so good. The whole X series is constantly foreshadowing the big battle between X and zero,
00:34:26 which happens a couple of times in X series, but you can say the climax is in the Mega Man Zero
00:34:32 series when zero kills copy X. It's got it's got this whole thing where like these four the four
00:34:41 like guardians what is like Harpuya the grew the wind guy Leviathan the water girl shadow the ninja
00:34:50 And I think the fire guy is Fenrir, right? Fire guy Fenrir. Yeah. Yeah. They're like these
00:34:58 they're these like heroes of justice that like defend they like they think they're the good guys
00:35:02 and then like over I think it's over the course of the first game they learned that like no X is
00:35:06 the leader of like this evil fucking empire or whatever we're the bad guys and they all you
00:35:11 know become redeemed. But it's interesting because what a fucking game the New Arcadia is
00:35:18 seen as like the utopian city for humans but they their X is killing off all the reploids and
00:35:28 you're defending them and fighting against that. But it's just kind of weird because in the X
00:35:33 series you're defending the humans against the reploids but in the zero series it's reversed.
00:35:40 Yeah, because it's like um yeah because like if you imagine like the historical timeline like X
00:35:46 was known like in the X games he fights against the evil reploids because these maverick reploids
00:35:53 are more powerful than humans and they're they're like it's like um it's like Magneto in the X
00:36:00 men they're like well you know fuck the humans right like we're better than them. But then like
00:36:06 by the time I guess reploid technology was so successful that by the time Mega Man Zero happens
00:36:11 like reploids are they're they're like indistinguishable from people but so I guess like
00:36:18 because you know because this new X that thinks he's the old X is like yeah I fight the reploids
00:36:24 reploids bad so you know persecute them even though like now the tables have turned and like now the
00:36:30 reploids are the underdog sort of sort of you know except for the good reploids that like work for me
00:36:37 my fucking four like elemental champions or whatever and also me because I'm special because
00:36:44 I'm because I'm the hero was he called himself he calls himself like the fucking hero of legend he
00:36:50 has some like I'm I'm like the show I think he calls himself like the chosen one or something
00:36:53 because he thinks like yeah X is this hero from history like he's the I'm the greatest fucking
00:36:58 reploid that ever lived like I saved the human race I can do no wrong. Yeah it's something like that
00:37:03 it's uh it's pretty freaking cool when you think about it um there's a lot of I'm getting I'm getting
00:37:09 fucking hype I'm getting excited over here I have a remembering I've never played really any Mega Man
00:37:16 except what the first one that I bought on the Wii store um and I've I've always been curious
00:37:22 because I know there's loads of spin-off series and I'm like looking at the timeline to see if
00:37:26 like it's a jumbled mess like Zelda but it seems to be just in order like Mega Man series is like
00:37:32 20 xx Mega Man x is 21 xx so that's yeah yeah it's pretty yeah because I mean later like
00:37:39 Mega Man zx uh century after the zero series Mega Man the legend several thousand years later
00:37:46 just keeps going whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa mega man legends is after zx yeah apparently
00:37:53 but that's what the whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what the fuck what the fuck is this
00:37:59 link link let me scroll uh yeah it's just it's just the um you see the that doesn't make any
00:38:05 fucking sense I'm I'm looking at it but it makes this is unacceptable makes sense if you're a big
00:38:11 Mega Man fan nerd like I am but um basically okay this is not this is not canon yeah it might not
00:38:19 be canon I'm not sure if it is canon or not but it's theorized by the fans that Mega Man legends
00:38:24 takes place after uh zx because in zx humans and reploids start to become almost the same
00:38:32 and humans start incorporating like cybernetic uh implants into themselves and in Mega Man
00:38:38 legends um I think in legends it's determined or confirmed that all the humans are basically
00:38:45 reploids by that point oh god okay but I thought that I thought that the Mega Man from Mega Man
00:38:53 legends just is original Mega Man from the Mega Man games just like in 3d uh no he's a he's a
00:39:00 different character he's uh I forget is I mean they're both called Mega Man whereas like Mega Man
00:39:10 X is called X well the um so I just assumed yeah but the one in legends actually his name is
00:39:17 Volnott or something like that or his last name is Volnott I think um my memories where's all the
00:39:24 like strategy like the small like um turn-based whatever games are they what do you mean the
00:39:29 rpgs uh the battle network series and oh battle network battle network's gotta be somewhere else
00:39:36 battle network's gotta be its own and that's just separate timeline timeline I don't know where
00:39:41 it no is it separate I would I would hope that it figures somewhere on the time I was really just
00:39:46 looking at like the beginning and then I was scrolling down to look at the specifics but this
00:39:50 is like how it's laid out at the top and I'm like okay so the series follow on like chronologically
00:39:59 yeah for the most part uh but then there's no mention of the uh I guess this is Mega Man
00:40:05 timeline classic oh god wait I'm looking at the I'm looking at the zero timeline which is that
00:40:13 that's just the image at the top I didn't really look at that yeah that's not the whole thing that's
00:40:18 just that's just between x and zero yeah but uh the battle network series takes place on its own
00:40:23 timeline or universe it's not related to uh the main timeline wait oh wait this is a comprehensive
00:40:30 timeline for classic mega man mega man x mega man zero mega all of these series occur in a timeline
00:40:35 that deviates from the timeline seen in the mega man battle network and mega man star force series
00:40:40 which are canon to one another but not the other series yeah the wait what was that second one
00:40:47 um you mean star force on something wrong uh yeah mega man star force series star force is a
00:40:53 the spiritual successor to battle network it takes place like I think a hundred or two hundred years
00:40:58 after battle network so it is a timeline that deviates so if if now I gotta look into this I
00:41:05 love I love like timelines I'm probably never gonna play any of these games I like figuring out
00:41:10 but the idea is that the main mega man's timeline is when robotics became the big popular thing but
00:41:18 the battle network timeline is if robotics didn't take off and instead like the internet became the
00:41:24 big thing so they they go into the web and they do battle network they do battles in online yeah
00:41:34 basically they they they they pull on each other digitally yeah I'm not um I'm not too big of a fan
00:41:41 of the battle network series but uh they're pretty okay if you like rpgs
00:41:49 series set in a parallel universe from the original meg man series where the internet has
00:41:53 become integrated with almost every piece of electronic equipment in existence from tv's to ovens
00:42:00 yeah so the what the oven gets like infected so it's just the real world yeah the oven gets
00:42:05 infected well I guess that is a virus and then it starts messing up your house and burning down
00:42:10 your house and stuff it's like I made a wooden television I made it like to combat the internet
00:42:16 I made a wooden uh something or other it doesn't doesn't matter and then um the main character
00:42:23 his name is lan as in local area network and um he jacks into a device with his little pda thing
00:42:33 he jacks into his little pp yeah that's what they call it in the games you you jack in and you jack out
00:42:43 and uh oh there's anime and manga yeah the battle network series was pretty popular and it had its
00:42:49 own anime and I guess it had a manga I didn't know that the mega man nt warrior manga authored by
00:42:59 what really bugs me what bugs me about this timeline is that I can't actually see any references
00:43:07 in mega man legends to like to like zero and zx like if there was any of that I would believe it
00:43:17 yeah I'd be willing to give it but like it's just fan I don't actually see anything it's uh I don't
00:43:21 think it's ever been confirmed to be canon that legends is related to um the timeline I would I
00:43:27 would need to I would need to be a list of like oh you know here in in this like room you can see
00:43:33 like an image that like refers to something that happened I mean legends never even acknowledges
00:43:40 the existence of zero I don't know this this just seems like some dumb but there there's a lot of
00:43:45 fan theories and fan canon stuff and um you know the the lore of mega man is pretty interesting you
00:43:52 could probably do a lecture on it it just it just that's true that I'm sure is true actually actually
00:44:00 100 true I'm just saying this just seems like a big like what if like oh what if legends takes
00:44:07 place in the future after zx it could you can't prove it doesn't and like yeah you're right you're
00:44:13 right it hasn't been confirmed um there's like little implications or nudges but it hasn't been
00:44:19 actually confirmed to be canon it's um I mean I'm looking for implications and I'm not really
00:44:26 I found a forum thread tell me if this makes sense in the x series a space station called
00:44:31 Elysium is being built roughly in the year 50 xx and the master is at least 3000 years old when
00:44:38 he dies before the events of mega man legends meaning that 80 xx is the earliest the series could
00:44:43 happen wait so x so in x there's a space station called Elysium yeah and I assume Elysium is like
00:44:51 an Elysium is or like something like that and Elysium is also in let in the legends okay okay
00:45:02 yeah it's um if there's a uh there's little hints like that but this still isn't a hard
00:45:08 confirmation that that's what I was looking for that's what I was looking for okay so
00:45:14 it's kind of like uh I mean I think there's nothing on the on the other hand only like little
00:45:19 on the other hand from other games I mean if them if if legends is like far future from
00:45:26 the original mega man then like they're not the same person but they had just have the same name
00:45:31 like it could just be a different thing that's also called Elysium like how mega man is just
00:45:36 also called mega man true but was there Elysium was there an Elysium in the original mega man ever
00:45:44 mentioned uh no it was the space station that was being built in the original mega man I don't think
00:45:49 so was the space station being uh mentioned in mega man x uh being named after an already
00:45:55 existing Elysium from legends who knows who knows which way around it goes uh oh yeah I honestly I
00:46:02 think that probably is true because like legends because like mega man x kept going even as like
00:46:09 the legends series was starting so like I would believe that like people making like later x games
00:46:16 might just name things after things in like the early legends game I think there's only like two
00:46:21 or three legends games there's only two and they were both but yeah yes one
00:46:26 yeah so yeah they they like the the the inspiration could have gone either well the
00:46:32 the x series was originally supposed to end at x5 and then Capcom made uh x6 without Inafune's
00:46:41 knowledge and he was quite upset about it when he found out that they made a mega man game behind
00:46:47 his back yeah it would be too this this could be a interesting video if if someone knew all the
00:46:57 stuff and they would you know would feel like you know like analyzing the truth coming down to the
00:47:05 I mean mega man doesn't have like kingdom hearts level convoluted lore but like there's so many
00:47:10 games that like there is a lot of it yeah like a lot of stuff has happened but a lot of the stuff
00:47:15 in games it doesn't really matter you know like a lot of it is pretty self-contained
00:47:20 that's just what they want you to think yeah but uh sometimes the most interesting uh stuff about
00:47:26 the lore is the fan theories as opposed to what is canon like um yeah there's a big fan theory about
00:47:35 Dr. Wiley's involvement in the x series and whether he was secretly controlling sigma or something
00:47:43 yeah and um yeah sure I mean this is a I've I think I've heard something about it but it's
00:47:51 it's not like I feel like there are some references to Wiley in x oh yeah there's there's definitely
00:47:57 some um like in um a mega man x4 uh spoilers uh the first cutscene when you play as zero uh it
00:48:04 clearly shows uh that Dr. Wiley made zero oh okay yeah yeah yeah that's right that's right
00:48:13 so like that's like fully canon like yes this is the future of the other game and then when you
00:48:19 get to sigma as zero there's another anime cutscene where it shows that uh zero was the first maverick
00:48:26 and he infected uh sigma and that's how sigma became okay I thought was that not the story from
00:48:36 the beginning I kind of thought that that was just like established in mega man x that like yeah
00:48:44 zero was the first maverick and he but he like got unmavericked maybe not maybe I don't think so
00:48:53 because in x4 they make it out to be like a huge revelation like it's a big plot twist maybe maybe
00:48:59 I just read that somewhere and then just like read that into the game when I was playing x because
00:49:04 as a kid I only play the original x like I played x2 and x3 a little bit however um this is foreshadowed
00:49:11 in x at the end of x2 when you kill sigma his final words or something like um zero you were one of
00:49:18 wily's last known he didn't he doesn't say why he said zero you were one of the doctor's last
00:49:23 creations why did you betray me or something like that so he he doesn't say who the doctor is kind
00:49:30 of implies that sigma is also made by yeah well sigma is not made by uh by wily he's made by dr
00:49:37 kane oh right right this is kind of weird but dr kane is an archaeologist and he discovered
00:49:48 x's uh body in a capsule and then he copies x's design and makes a bunch of reploids so he made
00:49:55 sigma I knew that so what I don't get is how does an archaeologist like learn how to build a robot
00:50:03 you know that's well he just copied the I mean he he didn't do it himself he just like
00:50:08 he found dr lights design yeah but dr lights design was like plagiarized it was the most
00:50:13 sophisticated robot design at the time and he just somehow copies it and and modifies it
00:50:20 it's like you have to know a thing or two about robotics to do that maybe he I mean maybe he well
00:50:25 you know he's probably just like Elon musk he doesn't actually do anything he just like hires a
00:50:29 bunch of engineers to like do it that's possible I never consider that possibility never thought
00:50:34 about it so everyone so everyone just assumes oh yeah dr dr kane did it you know it's his it's
00:50:41 his baby or whatever sigma more like sigma balls we're like leg good yeah okay yeah yeah you were
00:50:52 you were going there you went there mm-hmm I went there I'm not afraid snap snap snap
00:51:02 bass man I fucking hate video games yeah they're pretty bad awful oh dude speaking of video games
00:51:08 I've been replaying um phoenix right ace attorney trials and tribulations the third in the in the
00:51:14 first three games I played the first ace attorney game and I thought it was dumb I thought it was
00:51:21 bad well you're dumb instead because actually I mean I will say I will say that I think the second
00:51:29 and third games are much better with the with the um when it comes to like things coming out of nowhere
00:51:37 to save the protagonist that doesn't happen quite so often I remember like replaying the first game
00:51:42 it's like oh no there's absolutely nothing I can do then suddenly out of nowhere like the one piece
00:51:50 of evidence you need like you had no hand and you're getting that evidence for the case it just
00:51:55 sort of appears and then you can complete it and it's like okay that's just manufactured like
00:52:00 manufactured uh what's the word tension tension because like there's no there's no like ticking
00:52:09 clock you don't know that the thing you need is on its way but it might be late you just
00:52:14 think there's nothing gonna happen because there's nothing and then it's there were out of its house
00:52:18 but the second and third games are so fucking good I did um I guess you need to play you need to play
00:52:25 the third game to see Godot Godot is like the coolest guy in the world I did beat uh I think
00:52:30 all the ones in a ds except for I think the last one which was kind of like a weird action adventure
00:52:37 uh type of thing there's one where you walk around I didn't play that oh that's that's
00:52:43 those are miles edge worth investigations I think yeah that's uh I think the only one for the ds I
00:52:49 did not play such this is such nerd shit what's what's you just talk about mega man timeline
00:52:55 shit for ages I don't know mega man's cool mega man's about the horrors of war yeah Phoenix
00:53:00 right about the horrors of the law I mean this is just about this is just about the legal system
00:53:05 this is about being a fucking suit look I'm just saying there's a there's a lady called friend
00:53:11 Franziska von karma and she has a whip and she whips people and she's got a soft inner side
00:53:16 and it's so much my favorite type of character that I just can't help but love the whole game
00:53:23 it's that's uh that's anime stuff if you're into anime stuff
00:53:29 it's kind of like no no thank you to anime stuff it's not really like the way it looks the sprite
00:53:35 work is just good it looks like chunky and like more westernized than normal anime the the later
00:53:43 games like Apollo justice and some some other ones that I haven't played um that are built for the ds
00:53:52 where they they up the anime a little too much this is what happened to fire emblem as well I
00:53:57 fucking hate this as soon as they have more fidelity to draw things they hire artists that are just
00:54:01 two japanese and they ruin the style of the original games well fire emblem and ace attorney both went
00:54:07 down to fucking garbage as soon as they got too many pixels I wasn't talking about the art style I
00:54:13 just mean that's just that's the case with every game there's a critical mass of pixels that a game
00:54:17 just can't can't sustain and then it's bad forever that's why pokemon is bad once it went to the
00:54:22 fucking 3ds agreed I suppose too many poly too many polygons I kind of like they're just pixels but
00:54:30 I kind of like the the the character design of of pokemon sun and moon for like people
00:54:37 like it's it's not too enemy okay yeah that's fine but that's a whole that's a whole other
00:54:42 can of worms but um okay okay um okay my my my problem with ace attorney my problem with
00:54:49 his attorney was one uh it's boring two uh the actually the like the actual court
00:54:58 moments are like it I didn't really feel like I was like solving a puzzle I kind of just felt
00:55:03 like I was just going down dialogue trees um which sucked um and also okay and this one's
00:55:09 weird and this people probably aren't gonna agree with me on this one but like the fucking case in
00:55:15 the first game I don't know I didn't like the fact that you're like that you're like solving a
00:55:20 fucking murder case about like a woman who was just like fucking murdered in her home and like
00:55:25 had her head bashed in and it's got but like the proceedings as you try and discover who did this
00:55:30 is just like very kind of like it's only like sort of serious and kind of goofy and I just didn't
00:55:35 like it I just felt uncomfortable about like this is like gruesome like the crime here is gruesome
00:55:40 and like it's not being treated with the fucking uh uh gravitas that it deserves that might that
00:55:47 might be personal but I feel like the other two are objective criticisms that make the game objectively
00:55:51 bad uh why do you feel like it's not you're not solving a puzzle because I because part of part
00:55:57 of my my favorite thing is like listening to all the dialogue you know like investigating getting
00:56:03 getting the the the the testimonies and like checking the court record and seeing what information
00:56:08 I have to figure out who's lying and how that's that's like fun I guess I never I never felt like
00:56:17 I don't know it's been a little while since I played it but uh I I never felt I never felt
00:56:22 at all like I was in danger of like losing um it just felt like I just had to like
00:56:30 like I would win either because I not because I like to do something but because like I don't know
00:56:36 like there was like a really obvious hint that was like yes this is the option you should choose
00:56:40 right now or even if I didn't have that I could just exhaust every possibility then like maybe I
00:56:47 would lose if I really tried to but it just never felt like a real threat I mean I gotta be careful
00:56:55 here like it's it's not the hardest game ever it's just I think it's it's easy to like get there
00:57:03 by just clicking random buttons if you really want to play it like that but if you want to
00:57:06 figure it out the puzzle aspect is like engaging and fun well I well I didn't think so because I
00:57:14 didn't I when I found a clue I would just feel like it didn't feel like I had to okay it kind
00:57:23 of had the same problem but worse as like um what was that game um what was that game by the
00:57:29 papers please guy with the one where you're on a boat and you got to solve who killed who
00:57:34 I don't know something over a din I think over a din something
00:57:38 over a dean return of the over din um that one also kind of had this but not as bad where it's
00:57:44 like okay the clue it's not you you're not like looking at the scene holistically and deciding
00:57:51 like hmm what could this what could have happened here like what could be going on what are the
00:57:56 possibilities you're looking at it as though like this is a a clue that has been constructed for
00:58:01 you by a game designer and you are taking that hint you're like okay what hint are they trying to
00:58:06 give me with this uh okay they mean to tell me that like this is what happens I mean sure I just
00:58:14 I just like more inductive than deductive uh which is a problem a lot of games have that's not
00:58:20 unique to to reveal right sure it just it doesn't it doesn't feel like I'm solving a crime it feels
00:58:26 like I'm following a trail of breadcrumbs I think what helps me with all that is that I like the
00:58:33 the reward for getting it right is hearing more of like what the story and the dialogue and the
00:58:38 characters or all that stuff if you it's like um sure it's like a really good visual novel with um
00:58:46 yeah like a little bit of puzzle solving in like lore courtroom shenanigans and if you don't care
00:58:53 okay so much about like what the characters are gonna say like then the the puzzle maybe isn't that
00:59:00 incredible that bring okay I totally understand that um and maybe this is something that the later
00:59:06 games are better at than the first one but like that brings me back to my first point which is
00:59:10 that it was boring because like there was so much like clicking through stuff there was so much like
00:59:19 time-wasty stuff between the moments when you know you you put the clue together and then you
00:59:25 get the next piece of the puzzle but it just didn't I like it wasn't that engaging I mean I I will say
00:59:31 I will say the first game I I bet I bet the series gets better I bet the series gets better
00:59:37 replaying the first game it is definitely a little lacking in some of the the interests in like
00:59:43 dialogue stuff because they're just figuring out what these characters are like second game and third
00:59:49 game are like they really step it up on some of the cases definitely the third game I love a lot
00:59:54 well I um yeah I enjoyed the story of these games but uh I guess the gameplay maybe could be better
01:00:01 but I think um I think it's just inherently difficult to make gameplay for a detective kind
01:00:07 of thing like this I don't know if it's ever been done uh like completely successfully before
01:00:14 well I don't know about completely successfully I liked L.A. Noir that that was a good one because
01:00:20 you could miss pieces of evidence and go down a path and still complete the case and you would
01:00:27 just get the wrong guy what was that one what was that one like point and click detective game
01:00:36 and like Davoo made a video about it I don't know and it had like a very like sort of picture book
01:00:43 sort of was it a DS game I don't know let's go to divu.com hang on no I'm gonna go to divu.youtube
01:00:57 what it's the one where you're at like a swamp and you got to like solve an alligator crime
01:01:04 that sounds like my kind of crime I don't know um it does uh
01:01:13 uh never never call an alligator crocodile
01:01:18 why wouldn't would you because uh it's like calling a Chinese person a Japanese
01:01:24 I found it Detective Grimoire yes Detective Grimoire it's 11 minutes long I can't remember this
01:01:32 you know what I actually didn't play this game I just feel like I did play this game because I
01:01:37 watched this video several times and I feel like I know everything there is to know about it
01:01:42 and for I only just now was like wait a minute no I never I never played this game we go to
01:01:46 what am I talking about I think I saw my brother play this game it looks it looks pretty good I
01:01:52 yeah but I forget what what about this is like good detective stuff so go watch the video everybody
01:02:01 fill in the gap in this conversation that are like it does some things pretty good but other
01:02:06 things it's just okay that's just every video about anything well into well well because we were talking
01:02:11 about like like in terms of like specifically how it simulates the like detective like
01:02:17 clue finding problem solving solve the crime sort of thing that's uh that's really hard to do and
01:02:23 I kind of wish they would have a game that does that well because I think that would be a lot of fun
01:02:29 I I mean the thing I was talking about last week or a week before I can't remember about like um
01:02:35 what was it pick cross which is like it's I feel like it's detective but like at the very basis
01:02:43 level where you are using the information you have to determine which blocks which squares are
01:02:49 colored in and which ones aren't and um if you make a mistake you are stupid yeah I guess that's
01:02:58 that's the sort of the the neural firing that I enjoy it's like I wonder hmm which is this the
01:03:04 way it is and then the answer is this is the way it is you were right and I was feel so smart
01:03:11 a lot of older rpgs especially for the nes and a bit era they uh they had a slight detective
01:03:18 element to them because in order to figure out where to go you need to talk to the npcs in town
01:03:24 and uh piece together like the clues and hints like uh because uh there would be no
01:03:32 no cutscenes to tell you where to go so you need to just talk to the random towns people and use
01:03:37 their ecliptic hints to figure out how to solve the problem of the town or whatever is going on
01:03:45 which which games you're talking about like like castlevania 2 you know I mean a eight bit rpgs
01:03:51 like dragon quest or dragon warrior and things of that nature I haven't played any of those extremely
01:03:57 old um rpgs and actually um played a remake of final fantasy one yeah final fantasy one is another
01:04:05 uh good example of that and actually the the original pokemon red and blue um they were heavily
01:04:12 inspired by those old eight bit rpgs because it was in itself an eight bit rpg if you remember
01:04:19 not like a two bit rpg um just just two just just one like like on or off like gameboy uh and also um
01:04:29 every game is a two bit game if you think about it like that well officially every game is binary
01:04:34 officially pokemon was inspired by uh final fantasy legend on the gameboy or as it's known in
01:04:41 in japan to saga series god there's so many fucking sagas so many fucking series of things
01:04:49 franchises what the fuck no thanks what were they thinking what no thank you i'll have none of that
01:04:57 please uh why am i scrolling through pictures of francisco von karma because you love her ben
01:05:05 no no you well that's true well i am yeah the reason why uh the reason why i like the
01:05:13 plots of the you know the phoenix ride games is because i'm a big sucker for murder mystery plots
01:05:20 even though it's pretty cliched i guess yeah that's the thing is like the butler did it like
01:05:28 murders is boring like somebody wanted someone dead you just got to figure out why and whatever
01:05:34 like oh the murder weapon oh i heard that before said the detective on the crime scene for the 100th
01:05:40 time oh someone's dead big surprise how cliche i said like putting the tape around the body
01:05:45 tell me something i don't know there's a fucking body whatever like it's it's like when it comes to
01:05:51 crime drama that is the the the most overused in media but it's obvious because it's like
01:05:58 higher stakes than a parking fine and i just saw a fucking detective crime game where it's like
01:06:06 who fucking who fucking hasn't paid their fucking parking tickets yeah a detective game
01:06:13 where it's just you go to see what car whether it has the the the parking meter like ticket if it
01:06:19 doesn't you give it a fine you just move on actually i want an open world game like that you
01:06:25 walk around entire city just giving out parking tickets well i'm sure that would be riveting
01:06:29 gameplay i mean you could you can make a good game out of anything you could you really could
01:06:38 make a good story out of anything stupid boring things that suck uh can be great as long as you
01:06:44 are yeah papers please papers please was a great game yeah that's what i hear because it was bad
01:06:51 you can make a good game about being being the coffee or the tea guy in a studio in a work
01:06:57 office it's like hey get the tea you got to make sure you get the tea before they're upset with
01:07:02 you what's what's what's that game on the nes where you just gotta fucking like give people root
01:07:07 beer you know the one oh something yeah i've seen it parody yeah you throw beer at people
01:07:16 but you always coming at you you go through sasperilla everybody's always uh rooting for beer
01:07:26 more more beer wait uh what does what does gaston say
01:07:31 but it's just like more than i can bear more beer what for i'm depressed and that's me in 2021
01:07:39 but uh i like i use beer and all of my decorating
01:07:46 i think uh the main reason i like uh murder mystery plots is just all the plot twists and
01:07:52 surprise elements if if it's genuinely surprising that is and um i hate to be surprised no thanks
01:08:03 yeah i think that's right is it's pretty great like having having situations
01:08:10 that unfold in a way that you can't guess exactly what's gonna happen next and it's quite good
01:08:17 i always know that it's not obvious it's written really well yeah once the guy who made um the
01:08:22 first three he didn't do um miles edge worth investigations he there was a team of writers
01:08:29 that made what that one and apparently that one sucks hard that's a good thing i didn't play it
01:08:34 doesn't have his his his smart writing thought to like make everything fit together nicely
01:08:41 and that that that one video i made about professor leighton versus phoenix right um that
01:08:47 was also written by him and the creator of professor leighton so it was like doubly good
01:08:52 written that was such a good game oh yeah i i remember that video you made it was uh pretty
01:08:58 good from what i recall yeah it was before i i i didn't have and still don't know how to uh record
01:09:08 ds footage so i just don't it didn't bother i just pointed a camera at it well um i always like it
01:09:15 and murder mystery plots when the cop is turns out to be the bad guy or you know because that's
01:09:22 that's just real life yeah basically or you know when one of the good guys turns out to be the bad
01:09:28 guy because uh again it's kind of cliched but i uh i just love that betrayal plot point
01:09:37 and um do you remember i like to be surprised i like to be blind oh yeah i used to be a big fan
01:09:44 seemed like a look seemed like a little bit of it first series spoiler alert someone's a bad guy
01:09:51 nobody knows who it is no fuck someone's the bad guy what why would i want to watch a show
01:09:59 gib that has a bad guy in it i like good guys that would be an interesting experiment to have a show
01:10:06 where everything is just fine the whole time there's not even any problems hold no that's
01:10:14 that's just um isn't that just what like slice of life is well you know i don't think so because
01:10:22 like slice of life the problems they deal with are not big deals because it's usually from they
01:10:30 they have problems they okay okay they might have a problem or a conflict but like no one's
01:10:35 never like a murderer yeah it's always just like i mean maybe maybe sometimes there's like a
01:10:41 jerk late for the downside oh no how can i get to school that sucks how can i get to my first day
01:10:48 of school and eat my toast at the same time every story has a conflict no matter how small or big
01:10:54 it is no i'm gonna be i'm gonna brunch out i'm gonna break new ground i'm gonna have a story
01:11:00 when nothing happens at all nothing nothing happens a show about nothing that sounds quite
01:11:06 familiar to me nothing nothing happens maybe something happens on his way to work no nothing
01:11:11 happens it's just a shot of him driving for 45 minutes that's like uh that's like it's like
01:11:17 if you're murdered by a sign i guess that means you were sign found
01:11:24 oh god christ christ i'll fucking my sorry i um maybe i should tone it down from your honor
01:11:34 maybe you should fucking go to jail maybe you should fucking go to voice jail
01:11:41 this is the first time we ever put a guest in voice jail but there's a first time for everything i
01:11:46 guess uh so here's why i'm upset um i can't i can't get my gummies to be right oh i thought you
01:11:58 had the recipe correct no i can never i like i'll get it right one time and then i'll like try
01:12:05 and do it again and and then like it doesn't work like the last time i was like oh okay i wasn't
01:12:11 using enough pectin that's why they were coming out too like too too jello like and then i i tried
01:12:18 making some yesterday and i was like okay i'll use more pectin like i did last time so i used the
01:12:24 more pectin and they come out they come out like all fucking crumbly and gross and i'm like what
01:12:29 what did i do and then i go back to last and they come out gummy again i'm like it doesn't
01:12:33 work how are you measuring the same thing the input are you doing it very precisely i'm just
01:12:38 i'm just doing it with like a spoon you know with like measuring spoons oh okay i'm measuring
01:12:42 okay not like a spoon spoon no i really just remember like okay i use a tablespoon of this i
01:12:48 use a teaspoon of that um man man what about uh you know what you know what it is the the move
01:12:58 the move to corn syrup i don't i don't cook it i just like i just heated and dissolved it and
01:13:02 refrigerated the switch to corn corn syrup doesn't work that well honestly like the weird like
01:13:07 fiber shit the imo just worked so good it was so good and even though it's like it's like a weird
01:13:14 substitute for sugar but it's literally better than the real thing i can't fucking get a little behind
01:13:19 on the gummy saga what i remember you saying it's no longer keto gummies um what's the the sugar
01:13:26 thing is that part of keto you can't you can theoretically make them you can theoretically
01:13:32 make them with a like highly concentrated sugar solution in water but i decided to try making
01:13:40 them with corn syrup because corn syrup has a pretty similar consistency to the isomalt
01:13:45 oligosaccharide fiber syrup that i had been using for the keto variety and i just this is what i've
01:13:52 been this is what i've been trying to do and i just can't i just can't get it to be i just can't get
01:13:56 it to be both smooth and gummy like but also like have enough bite to it that it tastes like a gummy
01:14:03 and not just like a jiggler and i i i've made like three batches the last few days that have all
01:14:08 failed they're all trash um and it's annoying because pectin is expensive um like using a tablespoon
01:14:16 of fruit pectin is like well that's like several dollars worth of ingredients right there sure
01:14:22 blowing a lot of money on this uh project i'm think i can write it off i think i can write it
01:14:29 off as a taxable expense i hope well you talk about it i have probably use it as content as a
01:14:35 like thing to talk about on your on your income show that's that's what this is called the income
01:14:41 show i have probably spent possibly over a thousand dollars on like weird on like various powders
01:14:49 and like items and objects and molds and and liquids and ingredients and actually no i think
01:14:56 about it you've been doing it for quite a while that isn't that big of an expense if it's involving
01:15:01 like the equipment as as well well the i mean the equipment's not that i mean the molds were like
01:15:07 i don't know i probably like maybe like 50 or 70 bucks on all these different molds and so they
01:15:13 are not that expensive yeah but think of all the bitcoin yeah i think of all the bitcoin you could
01:15:17 have bought was that a thousand dollars ben oh man did i did i say last week that i'm out of the
01:15:24 bitcoin game you did yeah did i okay well i just i just want to say that uh i'm i'm you know i was
01:15:32 upset when i got out of the bitcoin because i had been up like a thousand dollars and when i got out
01:15:38 i had lost like 200 so like oh god but it could have been so much worse because it has continued
01:15:42 to go down since then i sold it at around like 30 35 k and now it is down to like under 32 so you
01:15:51 know i'm just glad that i sold when i did because it seems to be the the market has turned bearish
01:15:57 as they say i've got something to mention about coinbase specifically because that was the thing
01:16:03 i was using um apparently you can't take money out like in in in normal currency you can put
01:16:11 money in and you can trade the bitcoin for different cryptocurrencies but you need a different program
01:16:19 to turn it back into real money um so yeah my brother he he tried it as well and he found that
01:16:28 it was like like not good so don't get coinbase i guess i still look at how everyone says to use
01:16:37 coinbase yeah how's how's your one pound doing uh 83 pence right now it's actually gone yeah
01:16:44 since a little while ago so yeah it went really far down like yesterday it was down yeah yeah yeah
01:16:51 around uh around midnight on around midnight on uh thursday it was down to like under 30 k
01:17:02 it's bounced back a little bit yeah i noticed it went down a lot but i don't know i just used
01:17:06 that opportunity to buy more did you actually yeah because in theory it should go up eventually in a
01:17:14 future at some point hopefully okay but did you but did you actually did you actually buy so yeah i
01:17:21 did buy someone it went down it hasn't really gone that far down if you look at the old time
01:17:28 yeah it's it's not really enough for me i would i wouldn't want it to get like i think i think it's
01:17:33 gonna go fresh and then i'll be like yeah but i think it's gonna go down further yeah i think it's
01:17:37 gonna go down further and settle it might i think it might settle around like maybe 25 or maybe 20
01:17:44 or maybe even lower i don't know and then it'll probably just hang out for a while and then maybe
01:17:48 it'll have another fucking boom or not another maybe it'll just dwindle to zero the bit the bitcoin
01:17:57 boom they're gonna have another with like one day like when everybody in the world owns bitcoin
01:18:02 and then the price goes to the moon everybody in the world will be a millionaire and everybody
01:18:08 will just start having babies left and right and that'll be the and that'll be the boomers
01:18:12 mark two the bitcoin boomers and that's why people have babies because of the bitcoin
01:18:19 because everyone i don't know when when good things happen people have babies and you can afford them
01:18:25 but that's a bad thing you don't want to have a bad thing to ruin a good thing
01:18:28 look i i don't know it's just when when babies is that's when well why do you think the first
01:18:39 baby boom happens because they died in the war and it's like we got to make more
01:18:45 no no you fucking weirdo it wasn't that like oh no everyone's happy that they're no longer getting
01:18:53 bombed so it's like yeah cool well was that plus the fact it was that plus the fact that
01:18:59 like the economy was going like nuts because of like the post war boom or whatever yeah like
01:19:05 now we can we can take all of germany's resources and yeah things are cheap hell yeah hell yeah
01:19:13 and like you know we i don't know we made like so we we made so much money on bombs or whatever i
01:19:18 don't know whatever the fuck it was whatever it was that we were doing that made our economy yeah
01:19:24 i i never really went back and learned more about world war two beyond documentaries that i
01:19:30 occasionally catch on tv and my school like education it's probably a lot more going on there
01:19:38 that like governments don't want me to know about probably probably yeah i mean i
01:19:46 surely everything's declassified now sure but like um my my specific like educate like i've
01:19:52 only seen documentaries broadcast on the bbc and my english so that's like that's definitely biased
01:19:59 perspective on exactly what happened i mean i don't know it seems like the bbc is a real piece of
01:20:04 shit bbc seems like it's a real fucking biased uh news yeah i i don't like like they're okay
01:20:12 for some things but i will never really forgive them for like ruining jeremy corbin's reputation
01:20:20 in that you know the whole anti-semitism thing which was stupid not even real
01:20:26 they just kept going about it until people believed in and he lost
01:20:31 great seems like it's a it's a little bit like it's a little bit like halfway between like something
01:20:37 like cnn and something like fox news which is like a really bad medium i don't know if it's like
01:20:43 that's not a good happy medium it's definitely a cnn like like similar sort of like liberal
01:20:51 not really yeah not the you know anti-socialist for sure yeah yeah sure okay so you're saying it's
01:20:59 just like just regular neolib shit yeah i mean i'm not like that you know i guess cnn i guess cnn would
01:21:06 i guess cnn would probably be similar like cnn is probably very much like hmm you know
01:21:11 are trans people corrupting our youth more at 11 you know give give both sides of the argument
01:21:16 or whatever yeah the enlightened centrist position like i could feel i feel like that would be
01:21:22 generally a normal bbc thought is like huh what if we yeah platformed both sides
01:21:29 hmm yes yes yes oh my god i saw um i saw i just happened to see a video of roosh
01:21:42 you know remember roosh uh roosh v who's that yeah roosh i think i heard of that name never
01:21:50 never heard of him i don't i don't you've never heard of him um well he used he used to be like
01:21:56 a pickup artist guy who i i kind of followed and i kind honestly i kind of liked him i'm
01:22:01 ashamed to say that now but like i'd like followed this guy and read his stuff and was like this guy
01:22:06 seems cool um and you know anytime he said like some misogyny stuff i was like haha that's he's
01:22:13 just joking about that well you know i know he's been really he's been really bad for a long time
01:22:17 but i saw him on like a live stream of him uh like that he did just like last week and he's talking to
01:22:25 some guy called he's called the muslim skeptic i think i don't know anything about that guy
01:22:30 but um he's like some muslim guy who doesn't i don't know that's literally all i know he's
01:22:36 a muslim and he's a skeptic um but i don't know roosh was just going he's just literally just
01:22:42 being like yeah you know hollywood's run by the jews you know they're all lying to you you know
01:22:46 they want to fucking do miscegenation to dilute the white race just on iran it's on iran so i was
01:22:52 like i can't i can't believe it this this this guy used to be like this guy is like a hard he's
01:23:00 like a hardcore like traditional like uh like christian values guy now this guy used to be this
01:23:07 guy used to write books about how you could like um you know uh uh get one night stands with girls at
01:23:13 bars which is what i was here for well i mean in hindsight it doesn't seem that he's got a great
01:23:20 ridiculous that he would eventually he's got a great beard though strange he's got a great beard
01:23:25 he's gonna look great what looks fantastic a great beard spectacular i think uh this is what's
01:23:31 known in some circles as a grifter i don't think he is a grifter i think he's a genuinely a fucking
01:23:40 psycho i know i think he totally believes it he's he's i don't think he's just following the money
01:23:46 oh you never know it's tempting for some reason there i don't know i was just it was just
01:23:52 disturbing it's just disturbing because this is and and i met this guy i've probably said that
01:23:56 like i literally met this guy and hung out with him a couple times uh i have probably mentioned
01:24:02 that on here i met him i met him in poland this was this was before he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't
01:24:09 quite like this back then but that was what maybe like six years ago i don't know uh
01:24:16 so just so just unpleasant i was like i felt a little sick honestly hearing that well um this
01:24:22 is the perfect guy to get all your world world war two uh info from i think we gotta get ruche on the
01:24:29 podcast yeah please remind us about world war two who really was at fault how many how many i mean
01:24:39 you know hey six million that's like doesn't says okay well you know uh nobody is perfect not even
01:24:46 adolf hitler no yeah and and then all this time i thought he was but apparently apparently he's
01:24:54 cringe apparently he's said some cringe things now he's canceled yeah everybody makes mistakes
01:25:00 couldn't even you know what we should we should couldn't even finish the job
01:25:04 um sorry let's move on i don't even know why i don't know why i brought this up that letter
01:25:12 from christian i felt chipper now i'm depressed again oh just bring up the christian thing again
01:25:18 you'll be chipper all over oh yeah i'll just i'll just read the letter again i should i should
01:25:23 every time you feel down you just look at over at the podre and you're like uh yes
01:25:28 i think this is good nothing brings the mood down more than holocaust
01:25:34 it's it's actually it's actually pretty ugly honestly it's actually not a particularly
01:25:39 attractive rock uh this little bit of a hemi more fight it actually just looks like mold
01:25:45 um i i i'll show a picture in the in the podcast i wish i had a picture on like you
01:25:53 know i'll take a picture right now right fucking now a few moments later are you are you ready to
01:25:58 see this shit i'm ready uh no are you are you ready for the fucking to have your mind shattered
01:26:06 and your pelvis shattered uh here we go yes to the first part no to the second part
01:26:12 here we go yes to the second part podre
01:26:16 it looks like mold right it looks yeah it looks a little dusty like like it's something's growing
01:26:24 on it looks like uh yeah it's not like big chunks i mean it's not like big like crystal chunks
01:26:30 it's just like very small little like it's very small crystals just kind of like in like a layer
01:26:37 on top of this like geode rock or and that's what i was gonna say it looks like one of those georocks
01:26:43 or whatever they call it yeah i mean i guess it's not technically one it i don't or maybe i don't
01:26:50 know what if i don't know what specifically makes a geode geode ben do you have the capability to
01:26:56 make like a silicon mold like by by pouring it over this and make a podrian uh gummy
01:27:04 uh i would find a better rock to do that i guess i'm trying to think of ways this could be interesting
01:27:16 um man maybe shine ultraviolet light on it i've talked before about how cool it would be to have
01:27:24 like 3d molds of like rfck things like the various fruits and vegetables and a podrian too would be
01:27:31 cool and just make make gummies out of that once i once i had the perfect recipe and could actually
01:27:35 get my hands on the fucking ingredients i found a new flavor company though the new the new flavors
01:27:46 that i bought make the old the old ones were like bad like some of them were just terrible the new
01:27:50 ones incredible the new watermelon i got beautiful perfect guava love it strawberry decent cherry
01:27:58 pretty good this is a big step up from what it was so uh when you're gonna start selling these gummies
01:28:08 i don't know maybe never maybe never i don't know gotta make some money ben uh
01:28:16 maybe maybe i don't know you live in a capitalistic society you need to sell everything you make
01:28:23 it would take it would take a lot of um i would have to build up a bunch of infrastructure for that
01:28:30 i would have to i would have to have a lot of things in place that i don't have like a store
01:28:35 front and and molds and like a slightly more like a more a more steady supply of stuff and like a
01:28:42 settled upon recipe that i'm like this is what it's made of this is how i make it which i don't
01:28:46 really um i don't have any of that can't you just sell it online or something
01:28:53 well yeah but what about all that other stuff i just said uh step by step
01:29:01 i don't know i'm still gonna have a fucking etsy page i don't know whatever whatever uh sounds
01:29:09 complicated sounds complicated and like a dozen people would buy them and then
01:29:13 well that's even the point i mean what's the what's the point of anything you know
01:29:18 we're all just gonna die you know and soon too very soon that's a good point yeah the thing with um
01:29:24 like selling food products i think would be like much more complicated and annoying
01:29:31 like mailing them than it would probably like you would need to be a local like label
01:29:38 seller you'd have to go to the market i would at the very least have to like label them and get like
01:29:45 you know ingredient like they have to be labeled for sale yeah yeah yeah um food would be fun it
01:29:55 depends on how perishable they are if they go bad quickly then it's pretty difficult here's i mean
01:30:02 the thing about it is that like i don't expect to ever make any money from it so if i do it it'll
01:30:07 only because i think it would be fun and cool uh and i would just be and i could and i would
01:30:14 amuse me uh so if i ever do it that will be why yeah or maybe uh send it to people on on your
01:30:23 patreon as a patreon bonus no no anything but that no no i don't i don't want to i don't want to do
01:30:36 like monthly like i think like tom does like monthly or bi-monthly or whatever like care packages
01:30:42 i think maybe did she does i'm not sure she used to i'm not sure if she still does
01:30:48 yeah but i don't want to do that i feel like yeah like that would be you need to be making
01:30:54 uh like all of this extra stuff and then sending it in a little envelope on a usb stick or whatever
01:31:01 yeah which i kind of already do well i kind of do that just well because every now and then
01:31:08 somebody buys some more like pins or whatever so i'm kind of doing that but like those are just
01:31:13 one-time transactions it's not like it's it's not i don't i don't want to like set myself up with
01:31:18 any more like monthly or weekly responsibilities i mean to me that the idea of like setting up
01:31:25 things i mail to people makes less sense because the majority of like english speaking
01:31:33 viewers of things are gonna be from america which means a whole lot of bullshit shipping
01:31:37 oh that's true yeah that's a lie true it's always gonna be a hassle i could say europe only and
01:31:45 much less like things would happen yeah that's that's a good point it's just it's just gonna be
01:31:50 like inherently more expensive for you to do it oh and now because of brexit even europe is gonna be
01:31:56 fucking annoying nice god nice damn it awesome really uh you're really lucked out man europe's
01:32:06 so fucking cool like you know not england anymore no but it's it's it's so it's so fucking cool that
01:32:13 they just like decided like hey you know our borders like fuck them let's just set up like high
01:32:18 speed trains that just go everywhere between our fucking countries and they just did that
01:32:24 yeah that's so great i mean and then you you people just threw it in the trash well i mean the
01:32:30 train can't go over the water you personally ruined it you ruined it there's no point anymore
01:32:36 just throw it all away just i was there i was there in the shadows like climbing down like a
01:32:42 little rope and then whispering into the ear of the prime minister at the time whoever it was
01:32:47 saying dude brexit like that will be a cool title you know catchy slogan why didn't you just say that
01:32:55 and then they did and then you did well brexit does sound pretty cool it was really funny
01:33:03 you know the the word the name the name brexit so i can see why i cut on it's yeah it's catchy yeah
01:33:10 it's catchy annoyingly people are good at making things sound good even though they're bad
01:33:19 um i feel like we should have something to say about like the new president but like i don't
01:33:29 like nothing happens nothing's happened with that he's undone some some trump things immediately
01:33:36 which is like yeah sure a bare minimum so far cool i guess kids kids still in cages that's fine
01:33:44 that's good uh isn't that something that's been around for a long time um it would like the the
01:33:54 centers were like built by obama they were used under obama trump like they've been used more
01:34:02 under trump but they could be does they could literally be dissolved and like emptied out like
01:34:07 under executive by executive order like anytime yeah but what i what i mean is it just seems like
01:34:12 we could literally just stop doing that any time it seems like that goes beyond the administrations
01:34:16 for whatever reason uh it doesn't it's like why would so many uh why would so many presidents
01:34:26 from different parties continue to do the same thing because they're all the same they're even yeah
01:34:34 that's right this is the only way you get because they're mostly they're mostly the same that the
01:34:39 only way you can get to the top is by appeasing the largest number of people which means you have to
01:34:43 have no morals no fiber no no character no character development that's right nothing you have to be
01:34:49 at an empty shell or otherwise uh a freak a ghost in the shell wait wait wait i'm writing all this
01:34:55 down yeah cool this is fucking this is hot tips hot tips and tricks this is speed run speed run
01:35:06 government speed run the president see exactly uh joe joe biden like slow run the presidency
01:35:15 because he's like 85 uh so you know but he got he got there you know god bless him
01:35:22 uh no i won't okay i'm sorry i won't bless that guy that son of a bitch that son of a that that
01:35:31 that whores son uh

01:36:22 guy ever would rather not associate with him good thing all those people are never on the fucking
01:36:28 podcast anymore so this is not the first person to propose jones as a guest uh and then and then
01:36:36 more people would watch the podcast and it wouldn't be dead anymore uh what would you guys think this
01:36:40 is not the first time this has been suggested i mean is is monkey even like hot shit like he used

01:37:08 i'm being censored guy du jour um and then and then and you know and then that came and went
01:37:15 and then he had his cringe arc and i was like he had his cringe arc which is pretty funny it was we
01:37:20 all had we all had a lot of laughs uh i mean yeah we could i guess i would say we could do that
01:37:29 and i wouldn't even be that opposed to it but it's not gonna revive the podcast like give me a give
01:37:34 me a break yeah i agree that's not gonna revive anything but um why not absolutely i mean yeah i
01:37:43 mean it's i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i think mumke's kind of an asshole but like whatever

01:40:42 stupid person he's just like his his worldview is all twisted up from all the lies he's ingested
01:40:50 honestly i think he could benefit from some form of formal re-education encampment of some kind
01:40:58 pony hypnosis teach him you know like facts and logic and stuff i love facts nobody loves
01:41:05 this is my opinion i know he's gonna lash out against this he's a child but you know
01:41:13 no no no education ben don't throw those out of the pram they go down the pram they stay in the
01:41:22 game it's pretty critical no i don't want to learn anything no i hate facts so much
01:41:33 we're learning uh learning kind of sucks i'm not i'm not you know i'm just i'm just flawed you
01:41:39 know i'm just i'm just uh i'm just one of my foibles some of my foibles that just makes me even more
01:41:44 lovable is that i hate the truth and i love uh lies next one don't we all
01:41:56 hell yeah next one is called you're a joker and you didn't even know her three two one go i'm
01:42:07 listening i'm a few episodes behind and i'm listening to gib talk about how she likes fire
01:42:12 and ben was like oh yeah fire's cool i guess but i'm not super stoked about it and nobody
01:42:17 no one recognized the pun what the fuck sorry i didn't even notice i mean you see if i was there
01:42:26 things would have been different yeah you would have said instead i mean yeah i mean i just i
01:42:32 say stoked as a matter of course so yeah wait was that accidental i think so yeah lol and then it
01:42:41 doesn't count that's just that's just a phrase that i use so yeah no it's gotta be on purpose
01:42:48 yeah but what so uh good good catch good catch uh the next one is called um the next one is called
01:42:58 uh my mic is bad sue me why would you title your voicemail that why wouldn't you title it about what
01:43:04 what the voicemail is actually about okay three two one go i cannot believe that you wrote off mr
01:43:13 boop's ending as an even gillian reference it is the ending spells out the running theme of the comic
01:43:19 a critique of escapism the characters return to the place of origin leaving alex head cannon as he
01:43:25 accepts that reveling in fantasy can never be a replacement for the real world it's beautiful
01:43:30 and it's great and thing you've made me so mad that i'm gonna go fuck my wife lisa simpson
01:43:36 but on the episode where she's an adult so it's not weird i mean i i did catch the whole like you
01:43:44 know that okay i just i just thought the ever thing was ever thing okay it didn't need the ever
01:43:55 music but uh whatever doesn't really matter here's what i think here's what i think um
01:44:01 i i disagree i know this is a joke voicemail but i'm gonna respond to it as though we're serious
01:44:07 which is a bad habit that i have um uh i i disagree that one of the that the theme that a theme of
01:44:15 betty of mr boop is like that like reveling in fantasy is bad that's like entirely an
01:44:22 a seat and act for thing like there's no there's nothing about that in like the first three acts
01:44:29 that's just like a sort of like last minute like twist at the end that gets added and it's not
01:44:36 relevant before that so i suppose i mean the joke seems to be that the the comic is is it looks like
01:44:45 a four panel punchline comic and there's no punchline all the time it's just like the the author
01:44:53 is so stupid that he's just drawing about having sex with betty boop all the time and he's so brazenly
01:45:00 like unapologetically like making her love him over and over again so much that that is like
01:45:07 meta funny it's the author that we're laughing in the early acts yeah it's the it's the author the
01:45:14 idea that this guy is drawing about his his life and how everything's so fucking sick even though
01:45:20 it's clearly it's not quite as sick as he's trying to portray it is okay okay hold on
01:45:28 are you are you saying are you saying that like we're meant we're meant to read early mr boop
01:45:36 and read into it we're like the punchline of the early ones like is the hypothetical author
01:45:42 that is making the comic because like yeah because it's like ha ha some it's so weird
01:45:50 that some person drew this comic okay it's it's funny multiple levels but ultimately like the
01:45:58 punchline is about the author having drawn it like like ones where he's like you're never gonna
01:46:05 leave me right ha ha and she's like no i'll never leave you like that's never gonna happen ha ha
01:46:10 yes i love you so much in in fact it's it's like i'm gonna cry with how much i love like it's
01:46:17 there's there's elements of like unsureness in the way that he's like displaying affection
01:46:24 and he's drawing like it's it's multi-layered like i think the joke seems to be how soon does that
01:46:30 start to come in quite soon i think it's even before bugs bunny appears
01:46:35 hmm how the fuck is it is it boop.net is it sounding a lot like uh tails got trolled
01:46:43 uh a little bit a little bit like that um superficially yeah i mean sort of it's got some
01:46:52 it's it's uh tails gets trolled with boop characteristics um fuck uh
01:46:59 i mean it's similar in that it is a story which pulls all these fucking dudes together into
01:47:06 why can't i fucking find the website i can't believe far down when i when i click mr boop on
01:47:13 google does the webtoon comes up first and the fucking tv trips thing um oh god it's been
01:47:20 pushed so far i just want to look at the fucking website okay it's mr boop.net okay i found it um
01:47:27 okay so the first okay my wife is betty boop um okay even okay even in the second the second
01:47:37 comic is like i'll never get a divorce yeah and then it's the sort of the the the sure the the the
01:47:45 cocksuredness like like oh this is absolutely perfect but the cracks are so obvious and he's
01:47:53 still drawing about them it's like it's it's funny for that sort of reason okay okay but is the but
01:48:00 is the message there that like i don't think no i don't think living living in living in a fantasy
01:48:06 is bad sure okay okay okay but what i'm saying is like i don't know if i don't know if you can
01:48:12 say that like yeah the ending which is sort of like the in which like the fantasy finally crumbles
01:48:19 is like oh yeah that's like the culmination of the theme of mr boop which is about like you know
01:48:26 how retreating into fantasy is bad and like this is this is the the result of it because i i don't
01:48:35 like the tension like the tension in the early comics yeah is about this like this like total
01:48:41 cocksuredness about like like being married to mr the total like like the totally sincere way in
01:48:48 which the character and i guess you one assumes also the author is like being married to mr boop
01:48:56 sure is to betty boop sure is great but then all this yeah all these cracks are showing in that facade
01:49:01 and i guess i guess it sort of depends on if you imagine that like within the diocese that the
01:49:08 comic is being made by the fictional alec who like real who is the one that you see in the videos
01:49:17 who is like yes i invented the comic mr boop it's a comic about how i married to betty boop i married
01:49:22 to betty boop you know you know like fuck i feel like i've sort of been like i guess i i read it
01:49:32 as like like it's a comedy right like it's jokes and it's meant to be funny and it's being made by
01:49:37 someone who thinks it's funny for this character to act this way but i think no you're supposed to
01:49:42 assume that that the what that the alec making these is not the real alec but the alec that we see
01:49:48 in the videos who is sort of subsumed by the fantasy yeah i mean i'm not sure how early on
01:49:54 you're supposed to feel that because if you just read the comic and don't see the videos
01:49:59 i mean yeah like are you supposed to to to read the comic and assume that the author doesn't know
01:50:07 what's going on like that they are a tales gets trolled or sonichu
01:50:11 author like they they actually think this is like good because the whole website is like that
01:50:17 it's like shitty website um like 90s i mean bad uh you know all that all that i think what do you
01:50:27 call it i can't think of the word to describe but it sounds a lot like my content i think that
01:50:35 i think that this is a failure of the series because i think that the series assumes that you
01:50:43 sort of are on board with thinking that the author is sincere right i guess i guess it's not
01:50:52 because like he made the video spelled out pretty clearly that's like you should assume that okay i
01:51:00 i yeah i don't know how early is the is this the first like video that's what i know because i i
01:51:06 i because i feel like that video is what established it was it was tongue in cheek
01:51:11 like i could tell pretty quickly it wasn't like oh this is similar to sonichu and that the person
01:51:17 making it has no idea what's going on and they don't realize how funny it is but it's very clearly
01:51:22 obviously like constructed to be the way it is yeah yeah but it's still funny like like you
01:51:29 can buy into the character once you know it's a character that's deliberately the author is one
01:51:33 of the characters and he's playing it in a video that's like oh wow he's going to such lengths
01:51:39 to tell this joke okay i mean at some point at some point the comic itself starts commenting on
01:51:47 the fact that like alec in the comic draws these comics and like talks about himself drawing the
01:51:57 comics but i feel like that's like act no no that's that's even in book two even by book two he's
01:52:06 doing that damn okay okay so i think these themes are kind of established a little earlier than
01:52:14 maybe i thought but but but but oh my god maybe maybe maybe maybe this maybe this voicemail is
01:52:28 right maybe i am the fool maybe i've been under arresting any mr boop this whole time maybe it is
01:52:33 a a a unified thematic hole shit i mean it could be i still i still feel like the presentation
01:52:42 with the ava probably read it maybe i haven't watched ava in a while i forget whether the theme
01:52:47 is exactly the same i i still feel like the ava reference doesn't add a lot this is a mr boop
01:52:53 podcast now i love mr boop everyone should read it and it's finished and it's not a lot
01:53:03 everybody everyone who's a coward who says oh home stuck one piece they're too long i can't get
01:53:07 into that this is very short so you have no excuse okay okay all right i guess my my central
01:53:15 question then is for about the ending being good like is the the the ending is like the crumbling
01:53:23 of this like fantasy so is are we meant to be thinking i don't know if we're meant to be thinking
01:53:28 about the like i don't i don't know if we're supposed to think like oh this character has
01:53:36 is like living in a fucking like unhealthy fantasy world that i don't know maybe we're supposed to
01:53:44 but i i didn't i didn't start to think about that stuff until like way later maybe i might
01:53:50 fuck i might go back and reread the whole thing like knowing like knowing how it ends and stuff
01:53:55 so i can just so i can really have like a really well-formed opinion of like how thematically
01:53:59 consistent is this well i should uh that's right yeah i should read it too so um if i'm on here the
01:54:06 next time then i can contribute more to this uh discussion uh yeah if you yeah you should i mean
01:54:17 yeah i don't know why i don't know why you wouldn't have already read it since it's the
01:54:21 fucking breakout hit of 2020 probably the best thing that happened in 2020 was mr boob
01:54:29 i'm feeling a lot more confident about being married to you now
01:54:33 which if she leaves me i'll threaten to kill myself i'm just kidding i know that's this is
01:54:38 later right like this is book three uh i don't know this is after he comes out of the coma this
01:54:44 is like number 33 so this is not uh the mrs boob that i i remember this is book one apparently
01:54:55 what yeah this is only number 33 fascinating okay all right enough enough boob talk enough boob talk
01:55:09 uh it's time for act it's time for boob action when you when you step on a goomba that's a boob right
01:55:18 well the sound it makes it no it's a it's a it's a it's a
01:55:25 yeah i guess it's it's a foot stone it's a boop
01:55:28 uh next one next one is called twitter warning funny joke okay three two one go
01:55:41 uh you guys are all like i don't like twitter but uh have you ever tried shitter
01:55:49 no no he was right uh it was pretty funny thanks for thanks for the voicemail
01:55:58 okay next one next one is called an asian query so okay three two one go how long is a chinese name
01:56:12 oh i get it oh i get it yeah it's just a statement
01:56:20 uh it's not even well he said it was a query so yeah it was it was a it was a facade it was a
01:56:29 it was a one two punch i need to get to this been going on you need to get your voicemail
01:56:35 people to write one of my videos dude that should be a bonus episode where people like send in uh
01:56:46 what literally what we're saying we just read it we just read the script oh god no well you know
01:56:56 what that would it would become just like just like two people would be the ones that ended up
01:57:02 writing like most of it you know it would be like a handful of people might send like a little like
01:57:08 little snippets and then like two people would be like ha ha and they'd write an entire script
01:57:13 it would be horrible it'd be a nightmare no no unlike all of our other uh bonus episodes that
01:57:21 would just make for terrible content so it's something acceptable i did kind of seriously
01:57:26 consider doing that idea having somebody script one of my videos for me and i read it but uh i
01:57:33 think that's not a very good idea yeah but would you outsource that to just a a gang of hooligans
01:57:40 yeah that's that's probably okay yeah maybe okay okay next one is called and woo hussy ooh
01:57:50 woo uh three two one go there seems to be some confusion about us homestuck is my intellectual
01:58:02 poverty and mine alone all of my head canons are 100% legitimate whereas yours are waffa
01:58:11 way fake there is no room for interpretation whatsoever in homestuck not even a little bit
01:58:19 to claim otherwise is hella c and also in violation of my legal rights as an artist
01:58:27 i hope this quills things up ooh woo thanks hussy i didn't know you were such a fascist uh yeah
01:58:35 oh that reminds me um last time there was that that talk i don't know actually we if we talked
01:58:41 about it on the show but like the the thing you brought it up and the the hussy maybe being the
01:58:48 problem behind yeah yeah yeah our gentleman situation i read that whole thread oh god
01:58:55 can you summarize for me i can the summary is that uh it's likely that it could be both of
01:59:04 their fault and it's not just they fucked him over like he he uh implied in the thing that he leaked
01:59:12 because the the the non-disclosure agreement for the whatever means that nobody can talk about it
01:59:19 but he did leak something to someone who then made a post about it which is where everybody
01:59:24 heard about it and then that was taken off but of course once it's out there it's out there um
01:59:30 but the odd gentleman haven't said anything on their end and it was it was this guy basically
01:59:37 going through you know somebody gave him a tip-off that hussy may have been the problem
01:59:42 he took all of the statements and he cross-referenced it by talking to people involved uh seeing what
01:59:49 was absolutely false and none of it was absolutely false nothing could be disproven
01:59:55 which was uh curious and things seem to line up very very neatly um but the i think the the the
02:00:03 main thing that seems pretty likely is the odd gentleman were uh they were waiting around for
02:00:10 hussy to create the document that they could like the the the bible the the pitch bible the
02:00:17 the thing of this is what the game has to be please make it um they were waiting for him to
02:00:23 write a lot of stuff to to make that so that they could get started on developing the game
02:00:28 and um he took a really long time with that and in the interim they were like okay we need to
02:00:34 be making something so they started work on a different project which was the king's quest
02:00:39 thing with the idea that since that's also a point and click they can use what they build
02:00:45 with that for the hive swap thing later um but when hussy was ready he went to the odd gentleman
02:00:54 all allegedly by the way that i'm saying um don't actually have any proof of all this
02:01:00 but the idea is he well then it's proof we can just keep we can just keep repeating it
02:01:06 as though it's true and then it will be well i i i want people to read the the the big post
02:01:12 because it's quite extensive and it goes into a lot more detail than i'm going into so don't get
02:01:15 the wrong impression but this is what i've gleaned from it is it's likely that they were working on
02:01:22 king's quest because they had to wait for a while hussy did finally get him the thing but by that
02:01:29 point they were already working on a different game and they said okay we have to finish this first
02:01:34 because of contracts and stuff we'll get to hive swap afterwards and hussy was like furious and he
02:01:39 like canceled the whole thing and then set about making like having his game be made in house with
02:01:47 his own studio and then everything changed sounds like uh some hot goss that makes i mean if we only
02:01:58 ever heard hussy's side of it before then i guess it's not surprising that the takeaway of it was
02:02:02 it's their fault yeah there was lots of little bits where he's like making people believe that they
02:02:08 were so unreasonable but like the more i think about it and the more i read about this thing i'm
02:02:12 like what are the chances that this company of people are all fucking assholes and andrew hussy
02:02:20 just happens to be like yeah and they literally just like took they literally just like let someone
02:02:26 pay them a ton of money to make a game and then just didn't make it like that doesn't seem like the
02:02:30 kind of thing you can get away with yeah and then the fact that there's a non-disclosure agreement
02:02:35 with a with a settlement to like i don't know it's it's fishy which is why it's worth looking into
02:02:42 and yeah you know like i said nothing is like absolutely provable but nothing that this this
02:02:50 tip-off suggested is like like false necessarily like it's not you can't prove that it isn't true
02:02:59 i guess that's the the the curious thing about it um we should have a link to that
02:03:04 in the description well the the truth is usually somewhere in the middle with most things
02:03:12 that's why you gotta have this why you gotta have jk rowling on the bbc to explain why trans
02:03:19 people are a menace to society versus anyone else that says something else by the way that i hear
02:03:28 both sides of the argument all of that said about andrew i don't necessarily think it makes him
02:03:33 like a demon devil man it just it's like yeah like business is like complex and if he was handling it
02:03:41 badly i mean whatever it sucks high swap is like delayed by millions of years but uh you i don't
02:03:50 know i still like what he's made generally speaking you'd like to you think you'd chalk it up probably
02:03:56 more to incompetence definitely more to incompetence than malice yeah sure no thanks like like his
02:04:02 like i don't know i mean i don't really know what he's like as a person too much
02:04:06 aside from his media that he's made which is like assuming you know what a youtube is like from
02:04:11 watching videos of them well uh nobody's perfect not even adolf hitler yeah he all comes back to
02:04:20 hitler uh okay okay next one is called rejected application follow-up three two one of go
02:04:31 you know it then is that guy who applied to be a guest uh i just figured no hard feelings you
02:04:39 know i just figured i just saw that guy who commissioned the art of the wonder bread as his
02:04:44 only qualifications so i figured just had anybody had a shot you don't want to be on for the same
02:04:49 reason as that guy yeah that guy is on because he's like so fucking embarrassing he's he's like
02:04:57 a story he's a curiosity i think it's it's not that you need like high standard of qualifications
02:05:05 he earned his fucking place yeah no no uh it's literally just that we've heard of him
02:05:14 and that his stick is comical um you take uh you take applications for guest positions now
02:05:24 no this this guy said in an application assuming that it would help
02:05:29 it didn't oh that's pretty funny story didn't no hard no hard feelings i'm glad he says that
02:05:37 well maybe a sum maybe we can yeah actually maybe we hate him maybe a few would be fine
02:05:44 okay next one oh god next one is called um that dog is sexy so pucker up pupper

02:07:44 samurai don't give a fuck a real samurai would slice your head off in one go but this guy keeps
02:07:50 asking politely that's right that's like he's uh he's you know he thinks he's got something to
02:07:58 prove and he does uh fuck fuck you uh next okay next one damn now we know just learning
02:08:11 just learning so much okay the next one is called uh the ultimate bitch bitch rare
02:08:19 three two one go hey ben you know what makes me a rage um i just uh subscribe to the procrastinators
02:08:28 patreon no five dollar months here oh god i get the bonus episodes again all of them
02:08:35 they're great i'm listening to them no i'm listening to them on youtube please no not the ideal
02:08:40 audio player uh true but you know what i'll accept it okay so the bonus episodes
02:08:48 unlisted youtube videos and what do i hear
02:08:51 no okay maybe but it's not my fault
02:09:03 it's a video thing's still going is that it is that it wait what was that last but he said
02:09:08 he said something at the very end uh why why is it my fault um if there's ads on the if there's
02:09:17 ads on the okay first of all there there should really be mp3s are they're not mp3s of the bonus
02:09:21 episodes they're supposed to be they definitely should be there isn't so we should we should we
02:09:26 should we should update that we should do that um thank you for mentioning it the ones on the okay
02:09:32 the ones on youtube okay if there are ads on them i have personally removed ads from a lot of them
02:09:38 if there are some on the new ones youtube might have just automatically put some no no youtube now
02:09:43 they just put ads no matter what it's it's only whether like you having the um
02:09:50 the uh you need a certain amount of subscribers to get monetization you can turn monetization on
02:09:55 and off but ads are like always on they've changed their their how that works so we definitely definitely
02:10:02 sucks and we should make i thought they were mp3s there were there were of the there are
02:10:09 out of the old ones maybe whoever has been supposed to do that has not been keeping up with it but uh
02:10:14 okay well i guess uh you're gonna have to use ad blocker i mean it's not like i mean it's not
02:10:20 like we make any money from ads on the bonus episodes it's not like i would put them on purpose
02:10:25 because we would we must have made like less than a dollar on all views across all bonus
02:10:29 episodes if that were the case um so you know nobody wants that the ultimate betrayal true
02:10:39 youtube betrayed us keep keep your remember who your true enemies are okay next one is called
02:10:47 setting the record straight for ghost stories three two one go i gotta set the record straight
02:10:54 about ghost stories being a shitty anime made into a gag dub because that's not entirely true
02:11:00 it was based off a book series basically like anime goose bumps and was decently popular in japan
02:11:06 it just wasn't amazing the main problem was that yokai watch wasn't invented yet so american
02:11:11 didn't know what a yokai was and instead of trying to translate everything they just kind of went
02:11:17 whatever so we got the masterpiece that the english dub is today i don't know this is referring to
02:11:25 okay um we're i've heard you know the anime ghost stories nope yeah oh okay well it's long story
02:11:32 short it has it has one of those gag dubs in english like the dub is not faithful it's just
02:11:39 like deliberately stupid um oh and okay yeah and um okay so we said it must have just been a shitty
02:11:46 anime that got a dub and i guess it's no the answer is no it wasn't necessarily shitty it just
02:11:51 was not localizable so they didn't like try and do a faithful localization
02:11:57 okay i mean whatever i don't care i don't care if ghost stories is a good anime or not
02:12:01 well i guess that's why uh you should always go subs over dubs right um no because the
02:12:08 fucking i i'm not gonna if it were if it had been dubbed faithfully it would have no value to me
02:12:15 or to anyone i think well man i don't know whatever i mean i wouldn't care about it if it were just
02:12:20 if it were just normal i like that it's weird shit and schlock and and goofy ass bullshit um
02:12:30 okay next one is called wait a minute which one did i just yeah okay next one is called
02:12:38 monstrous usurper three two one go do you know who henry jay waterness is no henry jay waterness
02:12:48 is the right for the ceo of monsters incorporated during the movie salivan stills the company and
02:12:57 becomes the new ceo he just ceases the power that's not right what the fuck uh he's talking about
02:13:10 ink yeah but why um i guess the transfer of power was like he kills he just banishes the
02:13:19 the spider man by pushing him in the door and it becomes the ceo i mean i assumed he was like
02:13:25 like everyone thought he was the coolest guy that's vote for him to be the new guy you don't vote
02:13:30 you don't vote i don't think he well i don't know how it worked i just i never thought i never
02:13:36 thought it was like oh salivan just is the strongest so he rises to the top and he's now
02:13:41 in charge who who cares why are we even talking why are we talking about monsters incorporated
02:13:47 isn't that what uh isn't that what you did with the pcp ben yes it's it's no it's the exact same
02:13:54 it's the exact same thing became the ceo no no i'm the king i'm not mike wasoski in the situation
02:14:01 that can't be the thing it cannot be the case i just what is the what is what is there
02:14:09 is it so so this guy's asking is it is it fucked up that uh salivan like killed the ceo and took
02:14:15 over the company uh i guess i didn't even know that i've never seen salivan's a good ceo so it's
02:14:22 all fine there's no way to improve the only way the only way to beat a bad ceo is with a good ceo
02:14:29 that's true i thought all these guys are bad though no not if they're nice not if they
02:14:40 not if they have like fun sense of humor post uh things on twitter that are very funny
02:14:46 it's good it's good when it's good when one guy owns everything honestly that's the way he's
02:14:53 reji fees or something whatever he's a he's a he's a me he's a me
02:14:59 okay he's very nice and lovable um as a spokesperson he's very good i don't really know
02:15:05 a site he's he was head of nintendo of america which means he had uh he had a like in charge of
02:15:12 localization and branding and marketing and how everything made in japan would work in western
02:15:18 countries so epic yeah literally that's all right that's all right because i like him because
02:15:27 he's cool red reji seems fine i don't know i don't know i'm sure he's great i'm sure he's real fucking

02:17:11 pancakes uh wee wee or pee pee
02:17:18 three two one go i put my wee wee into your pee pee shut up i put my pee pee into your
02:17:29 shut the fuck up new piece of shit you can't do both of those at the same time you can do one
02:17:36 or two but that was uh that was some quality this guy should be in this should be in voice
02:17:42 jail if he's not already um all right next one is called uh the the most paramount of reminders
02:17:49 three two one go i'm calling you out ben saint yeah catch up on one piece okay thanks you're right
02:18:01 that's true how can you call you out if you don't if he doesn't even have a phone
02:18:07 it just keeps getting longer it just keeps getting longer and longer and there's more
02:18:12 like my dick make just like when i read it when i see corona pretty soon it's gonna be so long it's
02:18:20 going to have a two piece when i i just how am i how am i how can i possibly stay current with one
02:18:29 piece when new chapters just keep coming out like it's it's fucked up it doesn't make any sense
02:18:34 i don't i don't understand uh i'll read game of thrones once it's finished yeah that's like trying
02:18:41 to get up to date on penny arcade anyone remember penny arcade yeah sure sure but why would you
02:18:48 ever want to be current oh god why would you ever do that it's funny because when i first started
02:18:55 reading penny arcade it was back when they weren't around uh long enough to have too many
02:19:03 issues so i actually went back and read all the issues they they published and i i actually did
02:19:08 mean the comics right yeah it's comics but obviously now that that would be basically impossible
02:19:14 there's just too many i mean they put one out like three times a week right um maybe i don't
02:19:22 remember uh the schedule anymore all right i think funny i think i'm funny i'm pretty sure
02:19:29 this is wrong but is penny arcade control alt delete or is that completely different
02:19:36 no they're different you thought they were the same thing i thought they were the same thing in my
02:19:40 head when i hear penny arcade why would they be the same thing why would the why would they be
02:19:44 the same thing when they have our two different names i don't know penny arcade was the control
02:19:52 alt delete is a subsidiary of penny arcade i don't fucking know no no they're they're literally
02:19:57 bitter rivals they're bitter rivals um okay maybe that's why i've associated the two and then yeah
02:20:03 yeah like a lot of people associate the two mostly it's to say like oh control alt delete is trash
02:20:08 penny arcade is like that but good but like it's really not like penny arcade is also trash it's
02:20:14 maybe slightly less trash but like penny arcade but it's just it's just been more successful
02:20:20 penny arcade started in 96 i think and uh control delete started in the 2000s maybe
02:20:26 early 2000s wow this is exactly the same as control delete it's not the same i mean it's bad
02:20:34 and different i'm looking at it this is this is more sweet bro and hella jeff than then
02:20:41 that i mean that's true that's true well i i think probably was inspired by penny arcade
02:20:47 i don't know how i've never seen these characters i think i've seen the guy with the brownish hair
02:20:53 uh nowadays everybody associates control delete with the miscarriage comic yes meme
02:21:02 loss yeah um penny arcade is is like the worst thing that penny arcade does i've said this before
02:21:10 but like i like a lot of their like other like side projects that they've done over the years
02:21:15 the comic is like unreadable it's i don't understand why they keep doing it i don't
02:21:20 know anyone who likes it um i don't know why anyone would it's if it's a nightmare one thing that it
02:21:26 always uh annoyed me about their comic is that um a lot of times you don't get the joke unless you
02:21:33 read taiko's uh blog post about it yeah 100 you read the comic and you just be like uh i have no
02:21:40 idea what they're talking about you know okay a couple things first of all gabes art style has
02:21:47 like melted over the years and like i'm fine with him being more expressive but like it's really
02:21:53 it's gotten really weird looking like it just looks weird nowadays um and yeah the comic okay
02:22:01 i used to i've listened to every single episode of the um of the dlc podcast which is the podcast
02:22:09 that they would record like as they were writing the comic and it's literally it's them like riffing
02:22:14 as they come up with the comic and i love that podcast it's great the comics are dog shit not
02:22:21 a single one has ever been funny didn't they do videos of that podcast or something because there
02:22:27 were video yeah there were some video episodes i remember watching the videos and uh those are
02:22:32 pretty good i mean i've watched i've i've watched a ton of like side of like penny arcade side
02:22:39 content and like penny arcade adjacent stuff like i watched um like i've i've i've watched i've
02:22:46 listened to a lot of their old like um dnd uh uh groups and stuff like the c team mostly and uh
02:22:54 i mean i went to i went to pax that one year which was pretty great um what was that oh yeah
02:23:00 and the strip search strip search was was the best thing we ever did and they never did it again
02:23:05 because they're hacks because they're cowards wait uh that's the reality tv comic thing right
02:23:12 yeah strip search i remember watching that it was really it was really good i mean it was kind it was
02:23:17 kind of crap actually but it was kind of crap in a way that i liked and appreciated it's a reality tv
02:23:23 what can you expect yeah i mean exactly um i i think control of delete is better than penny
02:23:31 arcade just because it has loss and penny arcade doesn't doesn't have anything i'm looking around
02:23:38 the closest thing the closest thing that penny arcade has to loss was the dick wolves comic which
02:23:45 caused like a in hindsight like very minor and nobody actually gave a shit sort of like
02:23:52 political correctness oh yeah i remember that scandal um but like at the time it seemed like
02:23:59 a big deal but like nobody cares anymore and it's and it's honestly not even that funny and it's
02:24:04 like not even worth explaining penny arcade is like um penny arcade is like the gaming equivalent
02:24:10 of a garfield comic i think i i think i think you're giving it too much credit because it's
02:24:17 not just like it penny arcade is not something that is just like a simple like you know relatable
02:24:23 little like gag about something that's like oh ha ha i hate mondays oh ha ha lasagna no it's
02:24:28 actually it's hyper specific about like whatever is like the fucking gaming news du jour of the
02:24:36 week or whatever that like like you said you have to fucking read the text post that goes along with
02:24:42 it and even then it's still not funny it's just like oh okay i guess i get what they were trying to
02:24:47 say and the other thing about it is that like half of them are not even about like being gamers
02:24:52 anymore not that this is necessarily bad but it's not really like even a gaming webcomic
02:24:57 entirely it's a lot of it is just about like being dads which is fine um but i don't know
02:25:05 it's not well i never um it's weird i honestly never was that big of a fan of the comic i mostly
02:25:12 went to the website to read tyco's blog posts yeah it was a big inspiration to me as a writer
02:25:21 back in the day what are they what are they what are they doing now are they just like
02:25:27 streaming shit on twitch uh i don't know seems like that's most of what they do nowadays like um jerry
02:25:33 has the um jerry has like a a twitch show about like beer brewing or something and then they have
02:25:42 like a dnd group that also drinks the beer that they brew and they have a couple of like other
02:25:47 sites i think see i assume c team is still going i assume the comic is still going yeah of course
02:25:55 the comic is still going the comic will go forever even though it's like no even though nobody wants
02:26:00 it just just an uninertia it will continue until we're all dead um man penny arcade is such a
02:26:08 fucking bizarre you know honestly lecture idea is like the penny arcade diaspora because it has
02:26:16 like it spawned so many like weird things that have just like spiraled out into his whole little
02:26:22 universe like the whole the whole child's play thing it's like it's like a big or was like a
02:26:27 really big thing for a while um yeah i remember that yeah i mean i assume it still goes on but
02:26:35 what always surprised me about penny arcade is uh how he got so popular that they started their own
02:26:40 gaming convention and now it's like one of the most popular gaming conventions almost up there
02:26:46 was a three it's it's wild and like the comic did not deserve any like it like it's not good enough
02:26:53 it's just it's just doesn't deserve all of this shit that like was created off the back of this
02:26:59 shitty gamer webcomic but i guess because the like the only alternative was control alt elite which
02:27:05 people hated more like it had to be these guys i guess i don't know oh my god man nice image
02:27:15 resolution i i can't find a bigger nice image resolution you got there god god all right
02:27:25 this this has um that guy with the glasses energy this whole thing that comic or like the
02:27:33 comic no no the yeah the things i'm looking at all of all of these panels and things are just sort of
02:27:37 like early internet but like would never thrive today sort of feeling
02:27:46 yeah they i mean i mean that's that's where it came from and like they have like to their credit
02:27:57 like they have used this platform to like delve into all kinds of other weird shit like
02:28:03 like side comics and like you know they've made like you know
02:28:09 pen and paper rpg modules and they've done like twitch shows and they started conventions and
02:28:13 they still these other projects and they do all this other fucking shit and like that's all well
02:28:18 and good and i think that's pretty cool it's just really funny that like the the content that spawned
02:28:23 it all is like totally unworthy of any of it it's i think maybe um i think maybe the only reason
02:28:29 they got popular is because they were one of the first ones probably yes yes usually how it is
02:28:35 yeah of course and i was one of the first uh retro review websites and i never got popular
02:28:43 so it was it was the fucking wild west back then the
02:28:50 oh god the trenches is still going i think i remember what that is but i forgot i remember
02:28:58 but i forgot i just who who reads the trenches who is this for christ
02:29:07 honestly when i see this like gives me a sort of like terror like i'm imagining that there's like
02:29:13 there's some contingent of people out there who do who actually read penny arcade for the comics
02:29:20 keep up with the comics read fucking the trenches read um um what's the other one that uh
02:29:29 i don't know vg cats like i'm just thinking of like other things that have like i don't know
02:29:36 anything else that fucking like scott curtz does you know and then like i get it i get like the
02:29:41 heebie jeebies when i think it's it's almost like i'm staring like into like the deep like the ocean
02:29:47 and it's like some like i think i just uh for some people it's lovecraft it's lovecraftian it's
02:29:52 feels lovecraftian that there's like a whole there's a whole there must there must the existence
02:29:57 the continued existence of the trenches implies to me that there is an entire universe of like
02:30:03 people and culture out there that is totally alien to me who i can never understand and they
02:30:07 will never understand me and i'm afraid of them i think it's just uh for some people it just
02:30:12 becomes a tradition you know you just yeah don't stop that's true i guess that's true i
02:30:19 guess that's true and i have done that before i have like read stuff like just out of tradition
02:30:25 just like but i have i have long since abandoned all such traditions i don't keep up with anything
02:30:31 anymore uh i can't relate to anyone that does uh i don't know all right you move on to the next
02:30:40 voicemail yeah many do we have left uh it's not that many uh we have um what was that that one was um
02:30:52 one two three four we have seven left okay so it's oh my okay lol hopefully they're all short ones
02:31:02 that was the most paramount of reminders so the next one is called wait um the next one is called uh
02:31:09 last year on the pcp three two one go oh and while i'm here apologies for the ass phone mic quality
02:31:19 i'm in my bed didn't feel like getting up i don't care another thing you guys uh still don't have an
02:31:24 about section on your channel it still says under construction don't know if you guys want to do
02:31:29 anything about that but i thought it would be a good reminder to us all that the channel's got
02:31:34 hacked about a year ago um it didn't used to say under construction i know that it says under
02:31:41 construction i think like i asked Nate about that at some point and he said that no that wasn't
02:31:46 because of the hack but i'm not sure maybe it is i don't remember what was there on that before i
02:31:52 don't really look at the channel itself the about page but i guess we could fill it in with like
02:31:58 pcp is a thing under construction is like a pretty cringe thing for it to say honestly
02:32:04 yeah that's the kind of thing that websites from 2001 would have on their front page
02:32:10 was it was it a year ago that it got hacked was it that long i think so
02:32:19 hmm wow i'm trying to think of the the situation because we got the channel back or like some of
02:32:25 the channel's back so it was like not all of once that it was resolved and garlach house still
02:32:31 haven't uh he still hasn't paid for this uh injustice has he brad yeah brad garlach house
02:32:39 we'll take we'll take him to court he's he's being litigated as we speak um okay next one is called

02:33:24 it's not my game it's called noita other people play it okay three two one go
02:33:33 hey it's tommy j so uh the game that ben is referring to the like browser game with the the
02:33:39 the physics sim is called a powder game oh it is on the gamble website and there's also a mobile
02:33:46 version i highly recommend it because it's fucking free and uh it's great to pass time if you're like
02:33:53 the what what i used it for is i would be sitting there are other watch lecture there are variant
02:33:58 versions that other people still and listen to somebody talk even if i am paying attention to
02:34:03 what they're saying so i would just pull out my phone or my laptop because you can do that in
02:34:08 college and i would just set up some metal bowls and put water that would infinitely
02:34:15 respawn at the top and just watch the water eat through the metal bowls by resting them
02:34:22 and that's just watch that the whole time and uh and i barely passed my classes that semester
02:34:30 so maybe i'm not as good at multitasking as i thought okay but uh i had fun i guess this is
02:34:38 not this is not the one i was thinking of i have seen others that are different from this one this
02:34:44 is fun i'm playing it right now yeah me too i just i just put some oil on the floor and then
02:34:48 shot a laser into it and it's like it's making all this weird shit happen that's cool whoa bird
02:34:56 wait bird magma oh shit magma on ice what's gonna wait you can uh you can just pull your phone out
02:35:02 in college in class why didn't anyone tell me about that okay bird is just like bird is really weird
02:35:11 okay i'm just gonna i'll make a glass enclosure and just fill it with bird and then i'll just
02:35:18 put a torch in the bird no no no i'll put a bomb wait nothing's happening i'll put cloud no thunder
02:35:32 what's nothing this nothing's nothing's going on um okay magma
02:35:37 uh what is uh dude wind with cloud makes it all sort of do stuff wait like nothing is nothing
02:35:47 is working now like nothing that i put down is is happening maybe you can maybe i overloaded the
02:35:54 maybe there's like a pixel limit okay i'm gonna reload um okay s ball oh it's super bouncy ball
02:36:03 oh whoa look at it go oh can you uh can you actually learn physics with this
02:36:10 no no definitely not definitely not oh oh dude put some gas and then light it on fire
02:36:23 there's another one that is like a bigger screen and it's like it's got materials in it that are like
02:36:31 like you know uranium and like plutonium and you can you like electrons and positrons and like you
02:36:36 know neutrons and stuff and and neutrinos and uh and there's like mystery materials that will do
02:36:42 like weird like rainbow explosions and stuff if you combine them in certain ways uh oh firework oh you
02:36:50 put oh you put down some firework and then drop some magma on it that's pretty cool that's pretty
02:36:56 cool right there oh the pump is pretty cool it drags things along its thing okay now we're just
02:37:05 playing a video game yeah now we're yeah yeah yeah this has become a let's play okay i yeah i think it
02:37:13 i think it just um there's like a limit for how many things you can put on the screen and it
02:37:18 eventually just like stops you from putting more so that explains uh everything okay yeah yeah enough
02:37:25 enough but anyway uh was it called powder game yeah powder game that's one of them anyway um
02:37:34 next one is called uh Tommy J Ben's physics sim game thing ps uh wait there we go okay three two one
02:37:46 go forgot to mention a powder game is the browser version is not in flash it works some other way
02:37:54 so it still works it is not broken even though flash has died kind of based based based it works in
02:38:04 some other mysterious manner uh maybe it's html maybe it's html uh next one is called gas lighting
02:38:16 more like gas lighting but to gas means fart now
02:38:23 there it is okay three two one go why is it called gas lighting like i i know what it means and i see
02:38:30 it all the time but like i have to manually reach into my brain to find the definition every
02:38:36 single time i see it just because like i the name and that definition i think it's i think it's from
02:38:42 like my head because like what why is it what's just have is to have some analogy with like physical
02:38:49 using gas no to light something how am i supposed to know how that works i'm an e-boy in the age
02:38:59 we need a new gas lighting that is just the same thing but with a different name for the new generation
02:39:05 sending this voicemail was a really roundabout way to just google it but uh from wikipedia the
02:39:11 term originated from the british play gas light 1938 performed as angel street in the united
02:39:17 states and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations um term originates in the systemic psychological
02:39:28 manipulation of a victim by her husband and patrick hamilton's play gas light in the story
02:39:33 the husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane the play's title
02:39:38 alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the gas lights in their home while pretending
02:39:44 nothing has changed okay so in the in the play this is a lay epic reference oh that's that's very
02:39:52 oddly specific in the play he tries to convince her she's crazy by doing some weird shit with the
02:39:58 lights and so that's where the play gets its name from and the term gets its name from the play so
02:40:06 there you go so the the term references a play that nobody has seen in modern modern times
02:40:13 probably more people know it from the term probably by a wide margin i would think
02:40:20 oh but that's okay sometimes things are just like that uh okay next i'm stretching okay next
02:40:29 voicemail is called um tommy j ben's crush three two one go yeah i hope i'm not the only one who
02:40:39 caught this uh ben is like trying to explain all these stupid little like running voicemail gags
02:40:46 and stuff like that to fucking this double cast person ben you're just like me you're the cute one
02:40:55 now ben i caught you you're so excited so excited to explain all this dumb shit to this guest i caught
02:41:02 you what does that mean how does it feel ben you're the cute one now what does it mean what does it
02:41:09 mean i think i think they're they're saying they caught you out um being excited to to like share
02:41:17 something with someone and that's cute i just i just didn't want manner i don't know whether
02:41:23 they mean in like a flirty way or not i'm not sure yeah i'm not yeah okay if it's cute that i'm like
02:41:31 trying to that i'm like explaining something that i'm like interested in i guess that would make
02:41:36 sense but this voicemail is called ben's crush who's my crush is in double cursed i guess i don't
02:41:45 think so maybe it's crushed as in you were crushed you think he crushed me with this voicemail
02:41:54 and he crushed you with facts and logic hmm hey fuck fuck you tommy j i'm not the cute one
02:42:02 i'm not a cute one i am that's like the second voice that i've been crushed by facts and logic
02:42:10 a couple times in these but this is the last one by the way this is uh the last voicemail we
02:42:16 is called tommy j why is education a cable package um okay three two one go why is college a cable
02:42:28 package why do i have to take fucking art classes and history and shit i mean the classes didn't
02:42:35 suck or anything but they weren't i wouldn't have bought them on their own because i can just
02:42:40 look at the internet and learn things like i mean the history class it took it's kind of cool
02:42:46 i read a bunch of fucking primary sources which never did in high school that's like awful that the
02:42:53 only primary source you read in high school history class is like the constitution and the declaration
02:43:01 and maybe the guettysburg address and that's like it like they talked about fucking magna
02:43:07 card and shit all the time in high school i don't know a single word of that thing that's kind of
02:43:16 bad why is education a cable package why do i have to buy all of this shit that i do not want
02:43:23 i want the fucking database classes and the fucking software practice and uh operating
02:43:30 systems i do not want fucking um music theory the music theory class is fine too but i would not
02:43:38 have fucking paid for it on its own um and then and then communications and gender still
02:43:47 wasn't as bad as i expected it to be but it just it's just why why okay first off i feel like you
02:43:57 went a little off the rails there first you're like why is it a cable package why do i have to get all
02:44:01 this other stuff and then you're like oh but they didn't teach me about the magna carta well so i mean
02:44:10 it sounds like so you want your education to be broader but ignore ignoring that um okay like
02:44:16 without without defending like the business model of private universities too hard i i will defend
02:44:23 like okay if you just want to understand like operating systems and databases i feel like there
02:44:30 are like degrees and certifications you can get like an associate's degree or or some kind of
02:44:35 certification course for that uh you can go to a career school they have schools for that yeah if
02:44:42 you're if you're um if you're going to college for your bachelor's degree like that is a like yeah
02:44:49 you have a like a focus you have a major or whatever um but like the point of a liberal arts
02:44:57 education is not just i mean you know just despite what people say right i know some people are like
02:45:06 uh you know fucking oh this fucking uh bullshit liberal arts stuff like oh gender studies like
02:45:11 whatever you know despite all that like the point of a liberal arts education like a bachelor's degree
02:45:17 is to like create like a well educated population and to give you like a broad education like the
02:45:24 point is to make you a well educated person in general not just to prepare you for the workforce
02:45:29 and i know i know that it's kind of fucked up and to make you well rounded i think is what you mean
02:45:36 yeah i know that it's kind of fucked up because like even just for the purpose of getting a job
02:45:42 you're expected to have this like broad education this bachelor's degree or whatever that includes
02:45:48 all this like tertiary liberal arts stuff and like yeah i agree that that's fucked up but like
02:45:55 in in theory that's what the purpose of a degree like that is and so i understand it uh
02:46:01 uh it's uh it's a weird it's a weird sort of the wires that get get crossed there where like
02:46:11 jobs jobs require this like jobs expect this like broad and non-specific education
02:46:18 and therefore and therefore job seekers get this broad education but then people are like oh this
02:46:26 education is too broad because we don't need it to get a job but like it wasn't meant to be for
02:46:32 the job in the first place but it like became that due to like cultural expectation and the
02:46:38 fucking private university business model i don't know i think uh most of college is just a scam to
02:46:44 get you pay money but um well the weird thing is uh because you mentioned private universities but
02:46:51 the weird thing is even public universities feel like they're just trying to scam you into
02:46:55 getting your money a lot of the time i mean yeah okay yes you have to spend hundreds of
02:47:06 dollars on books that don't shouldn't cost that much and then spend like a hundred and fifty
02:47:12 dollars on a calculator from texas instruments because that's the only calculator that your math
02:47:18 class is going to accept i mean true uh yeah i'm not trying to i'm not trying to defend any of that
02:47:30 yeah i mean there's a whole lot of bullshit with it but like okay if this question is about like
02:47:37 why do i have to study all this other stuff in addition to what you know i want to get my degree in
02:47:44 that's why it's because like i don't know i think the answer is pretty simple was originally intended
02:47:51 to be more than just a a specific a job specific like training program i think the answer is pretty
02:47:57 simple it's uh money they want you to spend money that's what it comes out my answer is my answer is
02:48:04 better my answer is more cynical yeah it's shorter and but i'm i'm trying i'm trying to see uh
02:48:16 don't don't cast me don't cast me as the as the as the as the fucking private college
02:48:23 apologia guy that's not where i want to be don't make me defend these monsters but that's like
02:48:29 where the idea comes from yeah but maybe that idea was manufactured by them just to make you spend
02:48:36 more money no it's it's older it's older than that it's an older idea than that it comes from like
02:48:46 it comes from like old ideas of like what a classical education should be and the you know
02:48:52 you know like the kinds that like fucking like aristocrats would get not because they need a job
02:48:56 because they don't need a job because they'll just fucking live off their family holdings
02:49:00 or whatever just based on like i don't know Hellenistic ideas of like truth and beauty and
02:49:06 shit you know but doesn't that still come to the whole rich versus poor thing

02:51:31 sense as a thing to say this looks very rsck this looks very rsck core what is all that green
02:51:38 shit it's it's like i put seeds and then ants and the ants built from the seeds and they built in
02:51:45 all directions and then something caught fire and now there's a vortex swirling of the the vines
02:51:51 are constantly growing and the fire is constantly putting them out and flying up so the green
02:51:57 so the green is vines the red is ants the red is magma or something or fire okay i thought the
02:52:05 green was slimes i mean i wanted it to be but i guess it's seeds well i put seeds and vines
02:52:14 and then ants and i guess the vines constantly grow so they like nobody this is like a stalemate
02:52:22 entropy will run out in the end no one no one can win in this in the battle in the battle of war
02:52:28 what is the war between like magma magma and seeds it's a complete the two most powerful forces
