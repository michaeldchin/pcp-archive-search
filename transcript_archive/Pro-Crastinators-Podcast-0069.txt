00:00:21 Yeah, we're really going to bring our wisdom to bear.
00:00:24 We've got Hippocrit, Hippocrit is here.
00:00:26 I'm very scared.
00:00:28 As you should be.
00:00:31 And we've got The Davoo.
00:00:32 Me and my rowdy droogs are out at night in the town to do a little bit of clunge dunking
00:00:36 tonight.
00:00:37 Fantastic.
00:00:38 And he's going to be the star of the show folks.
00:00:41 We already know this.
00:00:42 Alright guys, here's the topic.
00:00:44 You've been waiting for it.
00:00:45 You've been asking for it.
00:00:46 You've already seen the name of this episode so you know that it's time for the long-awaited
00:00:50 PCP fetish cast.
00:00:53 We're diving deep baby.
00:00:54 We're going both hands into that pussy, in and out, making it happen, expansion, ballooning,
00:01:00 a scat.
00:01:01 What else you got?
00:01:02 I don't know.
00:01:03 Seaman drinking, snowballing.
00:01:04 It's all on the table folks.
00:01:06 It's all coming out.
00:01:07 Yeah, that's right.
00:01:09 For all three of the ladies at home, be sure to get your dildos ready now because you're
00:01:14 going to be tickling those clits all night long.
00:01:19 Now just come right out.
00:01:20 I'm going to come right out.
00:01:22 I'm just going to say I'm probably going to disappoint everyone here because it's not
00:01:27 that I'm more weird than normal.
00:01:29 It's just that I pre-planned how I would talk about my weirdness in a properly paced distributed
00:01:36 way.
00:01:37 It's sort of good storytelling.
00:01:38 I've been putting lots of thought into exactly which details to say when.
00:01:42 For example, to know the right time to tell people that when I'm reaching for the lube
00:01:47 I sometimes accidentally grab the baby powder because the bottles are right in the lube.
00:01:51 It's all about delivery, more so than the actual substance of the thing you're fucking.
00:01:59 I'm just here for you to deliver, Davoo.
00:02:01 I don't care how you do it.
00:02:02 Speaking of that, we're into delivery.
00:02:04 Can we get in some baby birth pregnancy kind of shit?
00:02:07 That sounds good.
00:02:08 Brilliant Nate, we thought the same thing.
00:02:10 We did.
00:02:11 Okay, let's read our Urban Dictionary definition of fetish that we can move on.
00:02:14 All right, here we go.
00:02:15 Number one.
00:02:16 Urban Dictionary of every single fetish.
00:02:18 Oh shit.
00:02:19 That's a good idea.
00:02:21 Okay, number one.
00:02:22 We might have to refer to it for some more obscure ones.
00:02:24 Okay, fetish, number one.
00:02:26 An object thought to have magical, especially magical, sexual powers.
00:02:30 So my cock.
00:02:31 Okay, number two.
00:02:32 A sexual fixation or obsession with a usually non-sexual object.
00:02:37 Example, socks, horses, monkeys, pain, bondage.
00:02:40 Who says horses aren't normally sexualized?
00:02:42 Get the fuck out of here, dude.
00:02:44 Come on.
00:02:45 What about the monkeys being on that list?
00:02:47 That's not cool.
00:02:48 We are monkeys.
00:02:49 Yeah, have you guys ever been to blacked.com?
00:02:52 Oh no.
00:02:54 Okay.
00:02:55 Well shit, guys, where do we start this thing?
00:02:57 Where do we launch in order to scat you?
00:02:59 Well, you just said shit, so I think we should start there.
00:03:02 Let's start with scat.
00:03:03 Okay.
00:03:04 I mean, DeVoo, why don't you take us away?
00:03:07 What do you got on?
00:03:08 Well, why are you jumping to DeVoo so quickly?
00:03:10 Because actually, yes.
00:03:11 I want to get to DeVoo.
00:03:12 He's the most interesting one here.
00:03:13 Fine.
00:03:14 And the logical connection there is a taxonomy, I don't know, there's sort of a distinction
00:03:20 between being attracted to the substance of something and being attracted to the concept
00:03:27 of something.
00:03:28 And I am a very concept centric person.
00:03:33 Like I know that there's a lot of porn.
00:03:34 I sometimes, the hentai that I really connect with are the ones that have a lot of details
00:03:39 about how the character is feeling and what they're being put through.
00:03:42 Actually, it's more common in Western drawn porn, right?
00:03:46 Where the character will experience this horrible torture and often they just sort of shrug
00:03:51 it off.
00:03:52 Like they just sort of like, oh, well, I guess this terrible thing just happened to me.
00:03:55 And like every panel will add on more and more details of the terrible, unfair, cruel
00:04:01 suffering that they're going through.
00:04:03 And often they don't really react to it with that much suffering.
00:04:06 And there's something about context that can really get my cock tested.
00:04:11 Yeah, okay, okay.
00:04:14 Yeah, so it's like cruelty, unfairness, like tragedy, like just terrible things happening
00:04:21 to someone for no reason at all.
00:04:24 If it's then coupled up with some sort of other more specific thing I'm into, I'm probably
00:04:29 going to download it even if the art is shit, right?
00:04:32 Sure.
00:04:34 So just if we can dissect this as we go along.
00:04:38 So the first point you're making is if people are suffering and it's connected with something
00:04:43 sectional.
00:04:44 Well, suffering, yeah, suffering is like one of many contexts, right?
00:04:47 So does any of this have like, like, do you have a rationale for it or is it just like
00:04:51 an innate animalistic design?
00:04:53 There's different logics to it, you know.
00:04:56 So regarding shit, I am very much not into the substance of it.
00:05:02 And I can tell it some people.
00:05:03 No, when you see some scat thumbnails out there, it's like those people just like the
00:05:07 feeling of it.
00:05:08 No, but the humiliation of it, the intimacy of it, right, is some is kind of captivating
00:05:18 to me.
00:05:19 I mean, P obviously is a much more is a much more managed is the PG 13 of that kind of
00:05:24 direction.
00:05:25 Sorry.
00:05:26 The thing about P is like, I don't like the smell of feet, right?
00:05:27 But I like the fact that that's so, um, it's so TMI, right?
00:05:32 It's so intimate.
00:05:33 Sure.
00:05:34 Sure.
00:05:35 So, I mean, you know, me and my girlfriend walking on each other in the bath bathroom
00:05:38 peeing like all the time, right?
00:05:40 It's great sometimes we make out while peeing because it's so intimate, you know, make out
00:05:44 while peeing.
00:05:45 Oh, yeah.
00:05:46 So it's great.
00:05:47 That's great.
00:05:48 At my house, we lock the bathroom door.
00:05:49 Remember that scene in Almost Famous when the kid walks in on the girl peeing in the
00:05:52 bathroom and she's just like, yeah, no, don't worry about it.
00:05:54 Just stay here.
00:05:55 Yeah.
00:05:56 That was always a kind of romantic scene.
00:05:57 That's really hot.
00:05:58 And like, you know, I think also P is really fetishized because, um, hold on, the door is
00:06:03 being opened.
00:06:04 I have to wait until the door is shut again before I continue talking about this stuff.
00:06:09 Normies get out.
00:06:11 And now the door, I mean, it was my girlfriend.
00:06:12 Anyway, so now she shut the door again.
00:06:14 So anyway, Normies get out.
00:06:15 Um, because like, I think another big fixation of P is that guys and girls do it differently,
00:06:19 which I'm assuming is a big part of sexuality.
00:06:21 Like boobs and abs, respectively, can be attractive because that distinguishes the male and female
00:06:26 figure.
00:06:28 So like peeing out the front or down the center, you know, front ish is like different.
00:06:32 And that difference is what is captivating in a heterosexual way.
00:06:36 You know, like that's, it's like, wow, that's not how I am.
00:06:39 Right.
00:06:40 And it's that constant, uh, curiosity of what that must feel like.
00:06:44 Like my girlfriend a number of times, like, what does it feel like to have your dick sucked?
00:06:48 I'm like, it feels like if my clit was several inches long and was being sucked, like, how
00:06:55 do I communicate that to you?
00:06:56 There's never a way to do it.
00:06:57 And it's like constant fascination, that constant mystery that, um, I remember Jesse said that
00:07:03 after the first episode of the plebeian weeb was recorded, that he forgot to mention that
00:07:08 in his, his personal political philosophy is that if a boy and girl ever switch brains,
00:07:12 they are fucking obligated to have sex because it will be your only chance to know what it
00:07:17 feels like on the other side.
00:07:19 And so I think that is, um, yeah, differences in that is, uh, captivating.
00:07:24 So you're talking about, there's kind of an umbrella here of like, um, just sort of
00:07:28 exploring the unknown or, or, or experiencing something that's a very private personal thing.
00:07:33 That's sort of the underlying thing that makes the stuff.
00:07:35 There's a number of umbrellas I'm talking about, like probably two in the pink, one in
00:07:38 the stink, if you know what I mean.
00:07:40 And, uh, I don't know what you mean.
00:07:45 What is that an expression?
00:07:46 I'm just, I'm just like imagining like, like umbrellas going inside the girl.
00:07:49 I'm sure there's a point of that, right?
00:07:50 I'm imagining, I'm imagining it then opening and it's like, oh, no, it's like, oh, no,
00:07:55 people have died doing that.
00:07:57 Really?
00:07:58 Shit.
00:07:59 There was a, like a hundred ways to die.
00:08:00 Somebody, it was like a, um, those circus performers who swallow things all the way
00:08:04 down their throat and the fucking umbrella opened inside of them.
00:08:07 Oh, no.
00:08:08 Oh, that's fucked.
00:08:09 That's fucked.
00:08:10 Yeah.
00:08:11 That's not even like a fun, sexy way.
00:08:12 Like if it's in your pussy, at least that's kind of fun, but I died from an umbrella opening
00:08:17 in my pussy.
00:08:18 That was the sexiest way to die.
00:08:20 There's worse ways.
00:08:22 Okay.
00:08:23 Uh, okay.
00:08:25 So we're talking about some, some, some general themes here.
00:08:28 Um, here, let me say a specific fetish of mine that I, I just thought of, I was trying
00:08:32 to think of one, I was afraid that my tastes are like two vanilla, but I actually did think
00:08:36 of one that I, I recognize in myself, I do actually like a lot.
00:08:39 And you guys can tell what you think of this.
00:08:41 And it's basically, um, you know, cause I'm, I'm more attractive to like when the women
00:08:45 do things like the, like the porn I watch, the guy is just like, you know, he's just
00:08:49 the dick in the situation doing whatever.
00:08:51 So it's like the women doing things that's the interesting part.
00:08:54 I like it when the women are treated just like meat or like flesh lights or like not
00:09:00 even people, like they're just there.
00:09:02 They're like sex toys.
00:09:03 When you like treat a woman like a sex toy, I find that extremely,
00:09:07 It's that context.
00:09:08 Yes.
00:09:09 It's absolutely the context.
00:09:10 Now, obviously I'm not into dehumanizing people in general, but you see this a lot
00:09:14 in hentai with the mind break porn, where you just see a woman get fucked for such a
00:09:19 long time.
00:09:20 And then eventually at the end, like she's just like, she either is now into it and
00:09:23 she's just like, yeah, everybody fuck me.
00:09:25 It's great.
00:09:26 It's a fun time.
00:09:27 Or she's just like her, the, the, you can see in the eyes, the way they draw the eyes.
00:09:30 Yeah.
00:09:31 They always draw the eyes with this vapid expression, this vacant expression, like they have no
00:09:33 mind left.
00:09:34 Exactly.
00:09:35 Yeah.
00:09:36 Like when there's a bunch of porn I've seen where like, uh, there are these, these, these
00:09:39 are interesting to me.
00:09:40 There's like, um, uh, there's, there's a bunch of porn with like high schools, right?
00:09:45 And they're like very high performing high schools.
00:09:47 And so I forget the name of the show, but like what they did is they assign or there's like
00:09:50 a bathroom with female women, like strapped into the wall as flesh toilets.
00:09:56 Oh yeah.
00:09:57 They're just for public use.
00:09:58 Yeah.
00:09:59 Public use.
00:10:00 That's what you'll see on D sometimes.
00:10:01 Public use.
00:10:02 Uh, yeah.
00:10:03 It's, it's too, yeah.
00:10:04 It's as dehumanizing as possible.
00:10:05 It's to make them just this fucking product in a goddamn wall.
00:10:09 Though to self analyze myself on this, I think the reason I'm into it is because for a long
00:10:13 time I had a great deal of difficulty actually getting sex.
00:10:18 And so I would think about all the, wouldn't it be great if there was just like a toilet
00:10:21 somewhere which had women just strapped down that I could use?
00:10:24 Yeah.
00:10:25 Wouldn't that just be great?
00:10:26 I'm sure that factors in.
00:10:27 So I'm not, I understand that.
00:10:28 Oh, of course.
00:10:29 Oh, absolutely.
00:10:30 It's the, um, I mean, there's a pretty decent reason why there's a correlation between out
00:10:34 there fetishes and shut-ins or otherwise unattractive, unaccepted people.
00:10:39 I don't still self identify as a guy who gets laid ever.
00:10:43 There, I still have all these moments of like, oh yeah, I have like a girlfriend and shit.
00:10:46 Right.
00:10:47 Like, you know, and I feel like especially when I'm like 13 or whatever, the whole idea
00:10:52 of having actual sex is about as foreign to me as the concept of say, uh, like a fantasy
00:10:57 where like everyone in the world except me and like maybe five or so girls like vanished
00:11:00 like the fucking left behind series all of a sudden, right?
00:11:03 Which were some of my earlier fantasies, right?
00:11:06 And I thought like, yeah, like I know logically actual sex is plausible, whereas like a fucking
00:11:12 anthro transformation is not, but, you know, it's still felt that my dick felt that way.
00:11:18 Let's say, you know, the dick has its own fucking train of logic and its own ideas.
00:11:22 Um, and I think that if you, you know, I'm just going to talk about sex in general for
00:11:27 10 seconds.
00:11:28 This is sort of a general like moral thing.
00:11:30 I thought of like my, my, this is like my favorite neck beard of fedora, a statement,
00:11:34 which is that the whole idea of sex before marriage being bad was a rule that was invented
00:11:39 back when people got married at like 13 and now sort of religion and other things in general
00:11:45 societal standards have subjected us to this situation where people go into their twenties
00:11:48 as virgins, which is probably a thousand fucking times more unnatural than fucking a member
00:11:53 of the same sex.
00:11:54 And I think it is probably quite instrumental in getting people to fuck everything that they
00:11:59 see laying around their desk.
00:12:02 I hear what you're saying.
00:12:03 It makes sense to me.
00:12:04 Humans are obviously extremely sexual creatures and we want to do it all the time.
00:12:08 I mean, at least men, I can't speak for women, but they seem pretty similar.
00:12:11 They seem pretty similar.
00:12:12 Yeah.
00:12:13 You can speak for women.
00:12:14 Yeah.
00:12:15 Yeah.
00:12:16 I know some women.
00:12:17 You know, when I was a kid, I really thought that like women just didn't have sex drive.
00:12:19 Turns out I just met a bunch of shitty prudes.
00:12:21 That's not true.
00:12:22 That's not true.
00:12:23 Turns out I was a kid and they weren't revealing that information to me.
00:12:26 Yeah.
00:12:27 Yeah, it's true.
00:12:28 Hippo, what are your fetishes?
00:12:29 Like holding hands, kissing?
00:12:31 No.
00:12:32 Hippo was like, I remember whenever we, whenever.
00:12:34 Mud puddles.
00:12:35 It's mud puddles, obviously.
00:12:36 Ew.
00:12:37 No, no, no.
00:12:38 It sounds like an offset of Davoo.
00:12:39 Hippo's pretty high up there.
00:12:41 Hippo, I think he's the only one like me who was like firmly from the sort of deviant art
00:12:47 school of fetishization, whether or not he's using that website.
00:12:50 Well, like inflation, there, because there's a number of different categories, right?
00:12:55 There are the sort of certain sort of fetishes.
00:12:57 All right.
00:12:58 Hippo speaks for himself.
00:12:59 Let's hang on here.
00:13:00 Move on.
00:13:01 Yeah.
00:13:02 Well, I mean, I guess I am kind of up there.
00:13:05 Like Davoo, I have an umbrella of like, I don't know about many umbrellas, but I have
00:13:10 a lot.
00:13:11 Eat your pussy right now.
00:13:12 Is that what you're getting?
00:13:13 Yeah.
00:13:14 Like I keep buying them.
00:13:15 Yeah.
00:13:16 I just keep putting them in because they get lost and I just have to keep adding more.
00:13:19 Okay.
00:13:20 I'm sorry.
00:13:21 Like the, I feel, I feel all apprehensive about this.
00:13:25 I'm not as gung-ho as about me.
00:13:26 Dude, no matter what you say, it will not be as fucked up as the shit I already said about
00:13:30 wanting to dehumanize women and treat them like meat.
00:13:32 So don't worry about that.
00:13:33 It's, it's, you know, you shouldn't be hyped up for what I'm about to say.
00:13:36 It's really just that I have, I don't, you know, my umbrella is more about like, growth
00:13:43 and growing.
00:13:44 So inflation is part of that, but it's, it's not like, all right, I'm trying to think of
00:13:48 a way to put it.
00:13:50 Growth in humans in any facet is like something I'm really interested in, a realistic or not,
00:13:57 but usually I prefer the realistic stuff.
00:13:59 Like, like the natural breast growth of girls, just like if they, they just, you know, a
00:14:06 young teenager and then, you know, over the years they get like real big boobs and they're
00:14:10 like, oh yeah, I'm, I'm a sex god and I'm like, yeah, that whole, that whole process
00:14:15 was great.
00:14:16 It's, it's the sequence.
00:14:17 It's the process.
00:14:18 It's the, the going from one to the other doesn't necessarily have to be, yeah, it doesn't
00:14:22 necessarily have to be a thing that I would like otherwise.
00:14:27 Like, you know, it could be a penis.
00:14:29 It could be like a, just a person go like a giant, giantess.
00:14:33 It could be somebody getting really fat, even though I don't like fat people.
00:14:37 I think that's the thing.
00:14:38 Yeah.
00:14:39 Like the flat thing falls into like the humiliation, demeaning, you've become worse, specific fat
00:14:43 women are beautiful.
00:14:44 All right.
00:14:45 The thing is, I'm talking about it.
00:14:47 I'm talking like actual, like fucking round.
00:14:49 Like I'm talking like there are D threads of blue barrification straight out of really
00:14:54 long.
00:14:55 I'm not kidding.
00:14:56 It's really long.
00:14:57 I'm not.
00:14:58 It's not even like, that's not even hyperbola, man.
00:15:01 Willy Wonka that one did in fact in set, like incepted a very specific blueberry based
00:15:08 fetish in the dicks of many young men.
00:15:10 You're right.
00:15:11 Not me.
00:15:12 I mean, I'm pretty flexible.
00:15:13 I can do it sometimes, but, but, but some people are pretty into it because it's like
00:15:17 when you see that girl reduce to this pathetic little blob out of her own misdeeds.
00:15:22 It's like that's some fucking great a context right there.
00:15:25 You know what I mean?
00:15:26 It's just how the, the Disney cartoon Robin Hood got all you guys into my little pony.
00:15:30 Yeah.
00:15:31 Exactly.
00:15:32 I mean, yeah, obviously if you, if you want to talk about correlation and causation with
00:15:36 fetish is Disney and furry is pretty fucking objectionable.
00:15:40 Zootopia baby.
00:15:42 It's a, I was a late bloomer, but I want to go fuck a rabbit.
00:15:44 Yes.
00:15:45 You know, I do want to talk about anthropomorphized stuff, but I want to give to go on first.
00:15:49 Yeah.
00:15:51 But now I've lost my train of thought.
00:15:52 I was talking about, yeah, yeah.
00:15:55 It's not necessarily the thing in question, like the, the being fat, like I don't like
00:15:59 fat people.
00:16:00 I don't like just seeing a fat person, but the idea of somebody just eating like so much
00:16:06 that they become a giant, like even to ridiculous proportions, just becoming a giant blob of
00:16:11 like, you can't even see their face there.
00:16:12 So, you know, it's like, it's like weird.
00:16:16 It's, it's, yeah.
00:16:17 Conflation feels weird because that it's just a sphere and they just go outwards in a, in
00:16:22 a sphere and it's like, that's so far removed from human anatomy that I can't even.
00:16:27 I don't understand what's, what's attractive about that though.
00:16:28 Can you explain to me?
00:16:29 Yeah.
00:16:30 I wanted to ask, but I didn't want to seem rude.
00:16:31 Uh, what, what about the fat thing?
00:16:33 Well, like, yeah.
00:16:34 So like somebody gets blown up and you can't recognize their face and it's all like, it's
00:16:37 it's not, yeah, but that's the thing.
00:16:38 It's not the end result.
00:16:40 It's the fact that it just goes from one to more.
00:16:43 Yeah.
00:16:44 It's like the growth aspect, the, the going.
00:16:45 Like accelerated puberty.
00:16:47 Yeah.
00:16:48 Well, anything, any, any sort of growth thing, that's just really what I'm into any, any
00:16:51 growth thing.
00:16:52 And, and what I'm into like the most is the stuff that could actually happen in real life
00:16:56 like, like breasts enlargement.
00:16:59 Just over time.
00:17:00 Yeah.
00:17:01 Like a girl turning 14.
00:17:02 I'm into that too.
00:17:03 Yeah.
00:17:04 Okay.
00:17:05 Well, that's interesting.
00:17:06 But like what I think this is, we're coming from a slightly different perspective, at
00:17:07 least the way I view this stuff, uh, whereas at least how like this specific fetish works.
00:17:11 Cause like what I'm thinking about porn or like what gets me off is like, I think about
00:17:15 how my dick gets involved in this situation.
00:17:17 And like, that's what I'm really focused on.
00:17:20 And I just don't understand how my dick gets involved in like an inflation situation.
00:17:24 That's, that's, yeah, that's, that is the thing is, it's, it's, it brings us back to
00:17:28 the thing I said before.
00:17:29 But how, wait, wait, wait.
00:17:30 I really wasn't sure if he was going to say or not.
00:17:33 I'm sorry.
00:17:34 Well, I'm say, I'm going to say it, it's, it's the concept, it's the idea of something
00:17:38 happening.
00:17:39 Um, I'm trying to think of like exactly like the fat thing.
00:17:43 Cause like sometimes it's, it's nice when they just get put, uh, like chubby, they just
00:17:46 a little bit and they're like, Oh no, I put on weight, but you know, you love them anyway.
00:17:50 Like that's, that's all right.
00:17:52 But then there's the stuff where it goes way over the beyond, beyond what I would consider,
00:17:56 like after I'm finished, I look at it and I'm like, Oh God, that's not the point that
00:18:01 you'll use it.
00:18:02 But beyond the point where once you're done, you're like, yeah, and it's not, it's not
00:18:06 about sex at some point, at some point, like, um, there are things that aren't sexual about
00:18:12 growth that get me feeling weird, but it's not, you know, it's not my dick that's feeling
00:18:17 it.
00:18:18 It's just like anything that, where there's like, uh, like a monster in a thing that
00:18:21 just eats souls and it grows to a gargantuan size.
00:18:24 It's not about sex, but it does make me feel a similar feeling.
00:18:28 So really all it is is to this feeling.
00:18:31 Um, I don't know like, like, I think the last time I remember it like very vividly was when
00:18:37 in one piece, Gekko Moria was like getting loads of shadows and he was going in and he
00:18:41 was just becoming gigantic, but not only that in the anime, he had his voice deepened
00:18:46 like several octaves and it was, it was terrifying.
00:18:49 I was absolutely terrified of it and that, I think that was what it was.
00:18:53 It's the, it's the behemoth like gargantuan size that is uncontrollable.
00:18:58 It's like a Godzilla.
00:18:59 It's like, that's, that's, you know, it's way beyond anything I could even imagine.
00:19:03 It's terrifying.
00:19:04 That's, that's what makes me feel weird.
00:19:07 And then if they have tits, then it's also sexy, I guess.
00:19:11 So the, the, the female pirate from one piece, episode one, do you like her?
00:19:15 Doesn't she get all big and fat?
00:19:17 Alveda, she was just a baddie from the start.
00:19:19 She actually gets, she actually gets way skinnier later and becomes like a sex god as a,
00:19:23 oh shit.
00:19:24 Yep.
00:19:25 Wait, she comes back later on.
00:19:26 They have to bring back even the, the episode one villain for this shit.
00:19:29 She comes back with like a whole new context and is actually a much more interesting character
00:19:32 when she does and is pretty cool.
00:19:34 So, uh.
00:19:35 She does.
00:19:36 She comes back quite well.
00:19:37 She salvaged her well.
00:19:38 Oda doesn't forget, man, but okay, we don't need to get into a lot of these things.
00:19:40 So the whole issue that we were just talking about, once again goes back to the whole,
00:19:44 if you're a fucking virgin, your dick thinks that nothing is going to happen to it, so you
00:19:47 might as well fantasize about anything.
00:19:49 Like you can just keep going further and further down the, the fucking giant fat rabbit hole
00:19:54 there.
00:19:55 And having sex is a good way to stop sexual exploration, you know?
00:19:58 Yeah, yeah, it really is.
00:19:59 You gotta, yeah.
00:20:00 And like, so like inflation, right?
00:20:02 I think a lot of it does, once again talking about the whole context and also tactility
00:20:07 thing, right?
00:20:08 Like, um, I'm looking, I've deviant art search some, uh, and there's a, there's a pretty
00:20:14 decent, uh, focus on panty shots, which is to say this giant white wedge that is vaguely
00:20:19 in between their two feet, right?
00:20:21 And like imagining what that must feel like to have those panties be so stretched out,
00:20:25 which, you know, realistically, the clothes should just rip off, but usually the clothes
00:20:29 manage to stretch out, right?
00:20:31 And it's that feeling of like, hmm, what would have a giant feel like if it was this giant
00:20:35 12 foot ball?
00:20:36 Now I see how my dick can get involved here.
00:20:38 This makes more sense to me.
00:20:40 Nikki's looking at me.
00:20:41 My girlfriend has her name and, uh, just letting you know, like, I'm not particularly into
00:20:45 this one.
00:20:46 Like, I mean, if I had to, I could do it, but not really, but like, but again, also there
00:20:49 is the context of like a fact that a girl could be reduced to something like that is
00:20:54 like, oh man, that is so hot that she could be so like, I'm talking like a ball.
00:20:59 I'm talking like an actual fucking ball.
00:21:01 Nikki's like looking at me like shaking her head.
00:21:03 And that's the thing.
00:21:04 Don't kink shame this man.
00:21:05 Get the fuck out.
00:21:06 You're going to be, you're going to be bottling up my hero to food.
00:21:10 This is a sexual safe space.
00:21:12 Exactly.
00:21:13 Exactly.
00:21:14 That's why pedophilia is okay.
00:21:15 Triple S.
00:21:16 Yeah.
00:21:17 No, we'll get into pedophilia.
00:21:18 I'm looking forward to it.
00:21:19 You got more turns coming up.
00:21:20 That's perfectly natural.
00:21:22 We will, we'll, all right, we'll get to that.
00:21:24 I've got something else to say about, uh, stuff.
00:21:27 There's the, the, the futonari fetish, uh, chicks, chicks with dicks, um, oh, uh, this,
00:21:33 this whole thing is called a trap.
00:21:35 It's called a trap.
00:21:36 No, it's, it's a separate thing.
00:21:37 It's a separate.
00:21:38 I mean, sometimes I see images of, of when it's just a girl and traps or distaste, it's,
00:21:43 it's just a girl with a, you know, not even wearing anything down there.
00:21:48 Just sort of having the dick swing around cause it's like 50 feet long, doesn't make
00:21:52 any sense.
00:21:53 But, um, I, I, over the course of like looking at that sort of stuff, I've come to realize
00:21:58 that I like it, um, not because, because I can disassociate the idea of a male and the
00:22:04 idea of a penis.
00:22:05 I don't know whether it's, it's like the cause, cause as a man, I have a penis and I'm
00:22:12 not repulsed by it because it's not gay to look at your own dick because you have it.
00:22:18 So the idea of someone else's dick, it's just, uh, you know, the dick isn't inherently male
00:22:23 because the, you know, it's like, there's an idea of maleness being, uh, gay, but you
00:22:29 can't be gay if you look at yourself, you know, so the dick isn't inherently gay.
00:22:34 So if a girl has a dick, then it's just, it's just, you know, a girl with a thing.
00:22:37 And, you know, I actually had thought about this point for a long time because my favorite
00:22:41 hentai to this day is still Bible black and Bible black is just full of food.
00:22:45 It's like food is central and, uh, I really had to think about like, okay, so you've
00:22:50 got just a woman here having sex with, well, you've got, uh, Professor Kitami, uh, Kitami,
00:22:55 yeah, Kitami, who is, she's just a woman, but she like uses magic to grow a dick like
00:23:00 above her vagina and then she has sex with women with it.
00:23:02 So like that, that's cool, but like what's, what are the, what are the, uh, the bits of
00:23:06 this equation here?
00:23:07 So you've got two women plus one dick basically.
00:23:10 So like basically when you're watching them having sex, so like, for example, uh, in episode
00:23:14 one they're having doggy style sex, her and this green haired girl.
00:23:17 So like when you, when you're watching from the front angle, you get to see two pairs
00:23:21 of tits bouncing around while they're having sex.
00:23:24 So that totally fulfills my criteria of imagining where my dick would be in the situation and
00:23:29 I get to see two accidentally animated pairs of tits bouncing around.
00:23:34 It's fantastic.
00:23:35 It's really great.
00:23:36 And I love it.
00:23:37 Now I actually do prefer, uh, like one man, one woman just because it's that much easier
00:23:42 for me to project myself into it.
00:23:43 In case you can't tell, like my tastes are extremely basic here.
00:23:46 I just want to be able to imagine how I'm having sex with this person.
00:23:50 That's what I do like every time.
00:23:51 I'm wondering about that because I don't know whether I even think about that when I'm
00:23:56 looking at porn.
00:23:57 I mean, I'm not sure either.
00:23:58 Really?
00:23:59 I think what I do is I've never been into like lesbian porn at all because like I can't
00:24:03 I'm not really into that easily because it's, you know, lesbian porn is boring.
00:24:07 I mean, I legitimately think so.
00:24:09 Did you would argue against that?
00:24:10 But I do think that I think so too.
00:24:12 I wouldn't watch that shit.
00:24:14 I think it's like, I get a grasp of what the character is and then I just imagine how
00:24:19 I would interact with that person instead of just literally taking the place of whoever
00:24:24 is actually having sex with him.
00:24:26 You're using more imagination than I am because like I'm just projecting myself whereas you're
00:24:30 kind of coming up with your own stuff.
00:24:31 I'm coming up with like lore and stories of like potential like what would happen.
00:24:34 He's coming up with cum.
00:24:35 Indeed.
00:24:36 Oh, of course.
00:24:38 But yeah.
00:24:39 Well, that's, yeah, that's interesting.
00:24:41 That's why I like, I like, like characters a lot.
00:24:45 Like I have so many waifus because I just keep thinking about what they would do to me
00:24:49 or what I would do to them.
00:24:50 I've got a couple of waifus myself, so I'm no stranger to that.
00:24:53 But yeah, I hear you.
00:24:54 I hear you.
00:24:55 When it comes to specifically porn though, I do notice this about myself and my viewing
00:24:59 habits.
00:25:00 I'm looking for a guy fucking a woman because that's what I want to do and I want to see
00:25:04 most of the woman.
00:25:05 I don't want to see the guy's face.
00:25:06 Like whenever they put a guy's face in, I mean, I just prefer it if they don't.
00:25:10 Obviously.
00:25:11 You know, you see that in porn all the time.
00:25:12 They try to keep the guy out of the shot.
00:25:13 Oh, you know what?
00:25:14 You know what?
00:25:15 It might be, it might be because I'm not like, like built like the sort of normal, I'm not
00:25:21 either fat or muscular and whenever there's a guy fucking a girl, I'm just, I'm just kind
00:25:26 of small.
00:25:27 I'm small and skinny.
00:25:28 And that's, that's more similar to the shape of a woman that it is the shape of the man
00:25:33 that is usually fucking the girl in the hentai.
00:25:36 So I can't really project myself onto that big muscular man.
00:25:39 So it's easier to project myself into like one of the futonari girls.
00:25:43 Maybe.
00:25:44 Maybe that's how it works.
00:25:45 Girl, I know a girl who like she can't enjoy porn if the girl who is in the porn is like
00:25:49 not white.
00:25:50 Right.
00:25:51 And she feels bad about that.
00:25:52 I'm like, Hey, man, it's how you see yourself.
00:25:54 And like for me, I don't really think of myself racially.
00:25:56 I just think of myself as like having like curly hair and like having sort of my general
00:26:03 kind of face.
00:26:04 Right.
00:26:05 If there's like a guy who's like a big manly man with a beard, I can't project it all.
00:26:08 Right.
00:26:09 Or if they've got like straight hair or like short hair, I can't project it all.
00:26:12 But if it's a guy black or white or whatever, but he's got like kind of thick hair and sort
00:26:17 of like just doesn't look like a grown ass man, I can project myself way more easily and
00:26:22 I'm way more into that.
00:26:23 You know what I mean?
00:26:24 Yeah.
00:26:25 I mean, I do like it when the guy looks as much like me as possible and if he's like super
00:26:29 ripped or anything that will be distracting as if he's like black or something because
00:26:32 I'm not black.
00:26:33 So it's like, okay, well, that's not me.
00:26:34 Um, yeah, but it's never really been like a huge issue for me.
00:26:38 Yeah, I don't know.
00:26:39 I feel like usually at the moment of actual like coming, I'm thinking intensely about
00:26:44 the feelings that the female is going through.
00:26:46 I'm, I'm, I'm latching entirely onto that fascination of what it must feel like for them.
00:26:50 I feel like that's the moment where I usually like end up at, uh, because I don't know.
00:26:56 That's just, so that's usually why I can, I can, I can, I don't need a guy to be involved,
00:27:00 although it does often help, but I do plenty of like just two girls just thinking about
00:27:04 what they are feeling, you know, just constantly empathizing with that.
00:27:07 And by the way, to those of you, I, there is a contingent of people out there who argue
00:27:11 that like lesbian porn is the straightest porn for guys to watch because there's no
00:27:16 man there.
00:27:17 Obviously it's less gay than watching a man have sex.
00:27:19 Like what are you gay, bro?
00:27:20 Why do you like looking at dicks, dude?
00:27:22 Uh, just letting you know that's incorrect guys.
00:27:24 It's incorrect.
00:27:25 Yeah, reasonable.
00:27:26 Yeah.
00:27:27 I think they're onto something.
00:27:28 Uh, okay.
00:27:29 They should chop those all their own one off and then they won't be gay anymore because
00:27:34 they won't have a dick.
00:27:35 That makes a lot of sense to me.
00:27:38 Well, did you have more of your diet tribe to go through because we cut you off like
00:27:42 an hour ago?
00:27:43 Well, I mean, no, I'm willing to like just, I mean, I do have more.
00:27:45 I do have some notes.
00:27:46 Yes.
00:27:47 Well, I'm ready for it.
00:27:48 Yeah.
00:27:49 Let's me enter through that again.
00:27:50 So as I was kind of alluding to a little bit ago, like there's sort of like, um, different
00:27:52 cores or different layers of fetishism, you know, based on like how obscure it is.
00:27:56 Like, you know, people might say like, it's, it's a debate as to like what fetish is more
00:28:00 weird than another one.
00:28:01 Like say choking, you could argue, well, that's like bringing about death.
00:28:04 That's like pretty fucking extreme.
00:28:06 And also fairly common.
00:28:07 Yeah.
00:28:08 Tons of women.
00:28:09 There's a thing, right?
00:28:10 Like, you know, all that inflation stuff.
00:28:12 I think DVNR is still primarily the, uh, the home of stuff of that sort of sex sector.
00:28:17 Right.
00:28:18 I'm sure there's plenty on Tumblr, but Tumblr tends to be more of a quality zone, uh, in
00:28:22 terms of what you're going to see.
00:28:23 Uh, DVNR is an absolute dumpster fire of quality, uh, and that is what inflation is.
00:28:29 You know, I'm sure there's probably a number of people drawn to it because of the amount
00:28:32 of quantity of it because inflation is easy to draw because it's a circle.
00:28:35 Anyway.
00:28:36 Oh, true.
00:28:37 That's true.
00:28:38 Does Kirby Count as inflation porn?
00:28:40 Just inherently?
00:28:41 Oh, shit.
00:28:42 Oh, probably.
00:28:43 Oh, there's probably, like, I'm, I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of people who work
00:28:46 at Nintendo were into inflation, there's a couple too many times.
00:28:49 No, man.
00:28:50 Like, you know, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Yoshi has a power up in that, and Mario like doggie
00:28:55 style grabs onto Yoshi's ass and floats up with him.
00:28:59 I'm like, this was animated with a little bit too much, uh, TLC, for me to like not
00:29:03 be entirely unsuspicious.
00:29:05 I hear what you're saying, and it also happens that in, uh, both the Galaxy games, there's
00:29:09 those lumas that you have to force feed tons of bits to, and then they get fat, and then
00:29:13 they explode into a star.
00:29:14 Oh, and let's not even get into fucking Mario and Luigi Bowser's inside story, which is
00:29:17 all about being inside every intimate detail of Bowser's body, and also he grows and shrinks
00:29:21 a number of times, and also he has a weight gain scene.
00:29:24 Yeah.
00:29:25 Someone who works at Nintendo jacks off to Bowser daily is what I'm saying, come on.
00:29:30 Is Shigeru Miyamoto.
00:29:31 I think somebody...
00:29:32 Yeah, it's true.
00:29:33 You think anybody jerks off about playing Dig Dug?
00:29:35 Oh, God.
00:29:36 There's the inflation, and not to mention, of course, it's mentioning Miyamoto, there's
00:29:39 the whole power mushroom thing that makes Mario big, you know?
00:29:42 Oh, yeah.
00:29:43 That's pretty similar.
00:29:44 Yeah.
00:29:45 So anyway, so like, there's a whole DeviantArt section, and like, but the thing is, if you
00:29:47 go to DeviantArt and search fetish, then click newest, you're gonna get bondage, bondage,
00:29:53 bondage, latex, latex, latex, latex, latex, latex, latex, latex, furry, latex, bondage,
00:29:58 bondage, bondage, inflation, bondage, bondage, bondage, uh, and cutoff.
00:30:03 Right.
00:30:04 So the thing is, those fetishes are way more common, right?
00:30:06 Those fetishes are much more in the realm of people who do actually, you know, go out
00:30:10 and meet people, right?
00:30:11 So there's this website called FetLife, which is a dating website for fetishes, and it's
00:30:14 all about the...
00:30:17 Those kinds of fetishes, right?
00:30:18 And this list that I posted on the Discord chat, I might even share it on the internet
00:30:21 somewhere, it's a list of FetLife's top 100 fetishes as picked by its users, like how
00:30:26 many, like, users have identified with a fetish.
00:30:28 So bondage, oral sex, spanking, hair pulling, anal sex, blindfolds, um, then you go down
00:30:34 to the bottom, you get stuff like enemas, daddy girl, bisexuality, teasing, submission,
00:30:38 orgasm denial, cock-sucking, flogging.
00:30:40 These are all things that can be done in real life.
00:30:42 Cock-sucking is at the bottom?
00:30:43 This is basic.
00:30:44 This is basic shit, yeah.
00:30:45 I know, right?
00:30:46 And there are some weird stuff.
00:30:47 I mean, one time I saw...
00:30:48 Getting a blowjob is a fetish?
00:30:49 The thing about that life is you can actually add any fetish you want, and what you'll see
00:30:52 is a lot of profiles, men and women, they'll just start, like, mass adding, like, hundreds,
00:30:58 literal hundreds of fetishes that were submitted to the site while they jack off.
00:31:02 So some of them get really specific, you know, like, laying down while daddy rams his cock
00:31:07 through my left ear socket.
00:31:08 That kind of thing.
00:31:09 Oh, no!
00:31:10 Okay.
00:31:11 Davoo, is this the website you used to meet your current girlfriend?
00:31:14 Uh, no, that was a different one.
00:31:15 This website kind of sucks, because I'm not into these kinds of fetishes enough, you know?
00:31:20 Right.
00:31:21 Right.
00:31:22 And whatever.
00:31:23 Anyway, so, like, there's that difference.
00:31:24 So when you go to somewhere like DeviantArt, it's a much more obscure realm of, like, such
00:31:28 that the sex doesn't even have to be involved.
00:31:30 In fact, that's actually another thing I want to talk about in a minute, but I might have
00:31:32 to, like, restrain myself so I don't just go on straight for over two hours.
00:31:36 Oh, please don't.
00:31:37 Um, which is that, like, um, sex isn't even, most of my fetishes, like, the whole diaper
00:31:42 thing, right, the whole ABDL segment.
00:31:44 Yes.
00:31:45 That's the acronym, right?
00:31:46 But what does ABDL stand for?
00:31:47 There's two different subgroups.
00:31:49 There's diaper lover, that's the group for the diaper thing, right?
00:31:52 Then there's adult baby, which is in phantalism, right?
00:31:54 Yeah.
00:31:55 You can't be one without the other.
00:31:56 I mean, I think a lot of people are, but ABDL is the place.
00:31:58 Vote up in phantalism, people.
00:32:00 Yeah.
00:32:01 So, um, so, so, like, that often, if you go to DeviantArt and you look up, like, diaper
00:32:06 art on there, most of it, in fact, the vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority of it, never
00:32:11 is explicitly sexual if you don't have that fetish.
00:32:14 And if you were somehow unaware as to how fetishes work or you just weren't cottoned
00:32:17 on to the nature of the internet, you might just be generally weirded out and not even
00:32:21 realize that there is anything sexual going on.
00:32:24 And in fact, the comments section and the whole community on DeviantArt is amazingly
00:32:29 chased or chat, roundabout.
00:32:31 It never, there's no one who can just comments, I came to this picture, like you'd find on
00:32:35 certain other websites.
00:32:36 There's other, there's a site called diaperedanime.org where people will say, I came to this picture,
00:32:40 right?
00:32:41 Um, but I'm just like, if you go to DeviantArt, is there a gif of the Rugrats theme song when
00:32:46 Tommy's diaper falls out of the air and lands on his legs perfectly?
00:32:50 Uh, probably, yeah, but you know, there's some good art.
00:32:53 I came to that too.
00:32:54 Yeah.
00:32:55 Well, anyway, no one ever talks about sex there.
00:32:58 No one talks about being turned on by all that shit.
00:33:01 People just sort of say, ah, cute.
00:33:02 Everyone is on DeviantArt, you're saying?
00:33:04 Yeah, yeah, it's almost like a weird, like sort of drug deal.
00:33:08 Like it's like, it's like a drug market where everyone's like, hey, do you have the, uh,
00:33:11 the gashi?
00:33:12 Thank you.
00:33:13 Mmm.
00:33:14 Ah, this one will be quite nice up on my mantelpiece, you know, are you suggesting there's Deviancy
00:33:19 on DeviantArt?
00:33:20 Yeah, well, in the diaper community specifically, but all those like, I don't know what to call
00:33:24 them, like the pure fantasy ones where no sex is involved, like most characters aren't
00:33:29 hardly even drawn in sexually compromising positions half the time, right?
00:33:33 There's never any like genitals involved, almost never, and it's like, but it's still
00:33:38 entirely something you can jack off to.
00:33:40 I can jack off to.
00:33:41 It's entirely something that's like, it's, it's all those things I mentioned before,
00:33:45 context, humiliation, the sensation of like what it must feel like, you know, like what
00:33:50 a diaper feels like tact-highly, you know, maybe some people think, or think it's a really
00:33:55 good feeling.
00:33:56 I don't fucking know.
00:33:57 See, that's, that's interesting because I just fundamentally do not understand anything
00:34:01 that isn't like, like jacking off to anything that isn't just sex, and that's a limiting
00:34:04 thing for me.
00:34:05 That's a, that's a hang up I personally have.
00:34:07 So I'm just very interested to hear all about this.
00:34:09 You're only living half a life, Nate.
00:34:11 I know.
00:34:12 I need to expand my horizons.
00:34:14 And it's right.
00:34:15 Yeah.
00:34:16 I should have got a diaper for this and be crapping in it as well.
00:34:20 This is my favorite episode so far, and we're like half an hour in.
00:34:23 Yeah.
00:34:24 This is good.
00:34:25 This is good.
00:34:26 I'm actually learning from DeVoo.
00:34:27 I didn't know all these things existed, and he's like educating us on the communities,
00:34:30 and I'm really interested in it.
00:34:32 Me too.
00:34:33 Well, do you have any, any further points to make?
00:34:35 I mean, we've got some other things we can go to if you like, but.
00:34:38 Dude, he has two hours.
00:34:39 He has a whole PCP lecture of points to make.
00:34:42 I'm sure he does.
00:34:43 Oh yeah.
00:34:44 So what you were talking about a little bit ago, Nate, is that like, because you can
00:34:47 go pretty deep dive into de-esque stuff sometimes, right?
00:34:51 What is de-esque?
00:34:52 Like D, four-channel board.
00:34:54 Oh, de-esque.
00:34:55 Yes.
00:34:56 Yes.
00:34:57 Yes.
00:34:58 Yes.
00:34:59 Yes.
00:35:00 Yes.
00:35:01 Yes.
00:35:02 Yes.
00:35:03 Yes.
00:35:04 Yes.
00:35:05 Yes.
00:35:06 Yes.
00:35:07 Yes.
00:35:08 Yes.
00:35:09 Yes.
00:35:10 Yes.
00:35:11 Yes.
00:35:12 Yes.
00:35:13 Yes.
00:35:14 Yes.
00:35:15 Yes.
00:35:16 Yes.
00:35:17 Yes.
00:35:18 Yes.
00:35:19 Yes.
00:35:20 Yes.
00:35:21 Yes.
00:35:22 Yes.
00:35:23 Yes.
00:35:24 Yes.
00:35:25 Yes.
00:35:26 Yes.
00:35:27 Yes.
00:35:28 Yes.
00:35:29 Yes.
00:35:30 Yes.
00:35:31 Yes.
00:35:32 Yes.
00:35:33 Yes.
00:35:34 Yes.
00:35:35 Yes.
00:35:36 Yes.
00:35:37 Yes.
00:35:38 Yes, yes.
00:35:39 Yes.
00:35:40 Yes.
00:35:41 makes you look like a little girl.
00:35:42 Yum, yum, yum.
00:35:43 Big difference between that and like writing a, yeah.
00:35:47 Big difference between that and then like extensive
00:35:50 multi-branching stories on cyoc.net
00:35:52 about a girl becoming incontinent and shitting herself
00:35:55 and being changed by every different member of her family
00:35:57 and coming to that for about a week and straight,
00:36:00 maybe something along those lines
00:36:01 where sex never even gets involved.
00:36:03 That's being submerged into the same fetish
00:36:06 that for others is a garnish.
00:36:08 So for you, are you saying it's a garnish or a submerge?
00:36:12 Yeah, that's my dude, that's my guy.
00:36:15 If I can ask, what is the appeal of a girl becoming retarded
00:36:19 and her parents changing her diaper?
00:36:22 Well, doesn't Incontinent just make you
00:36:23 take control of your balance?
00:36:24 Nikki, what's the feeling about a girl becoming retarded
00:36:25 and her parents changing her diaper?
00:36:28 Good question.
00:36:29 She just gives me a sad face.
00:36:31 It's just deep personal trauma.
00:36:33 That's really the root cause.
00:36:35 No, I'd add it back.
00:36:36 Yeah, you wanna answer?
00:36:36 Oh, I'm gonna give her the mic.
00:36:38 She's coming up.
00:36:40 Get in close now.
00:36:42 Any second.
00:36:43 What's the time to get everybody retarded?
00:36:47 Yeah, what's hot about your girl being retarded
00:36:50 and then changing her diaper?
00:36:51 Being retarded?
00:36:53 Her being, okay, I can relate to that.
00:36:55 Yeah, it's not hot for the guy or the girl.
00:36:58 So she just says being powered.
00:36:59 Sorry, I have the headphones on so she can't hear you.
00:37:01 This is a really awkward idea.
00:37:02 I knew having her being in the room would be weird,
00:37:04 but whatever, it's the sheer powerlessness.
00:37:07 The sheer dehumanization of it.
00:37:09 They have no independence now, right?
00:37:11 Well, what about you?
00:37:11 Those are the things I usually whisper
00:37:12 in her ear during sex.
00:37:13 Is it?
00:37:14 You have no brains, no ability to think,
00:37:15 no independence, no ability to make decisions,
00:37:18 no freedom.
00:37:19 You don't have the option for freedom.
00:37:21 You have no ability to choose.
00:37:23 Okay, all of that is true in Trump's America
00:37:25 for a woman anyway.
00:37:26 It is, I mean, in North America.
00:37:28 Now, I know that sounds weird people,
00:37:31 but I'm sure there's a lot of virgins.
00:37:33 Listen to this.
00:37:34 This is normal shit to say during sex.
00:37:35 It is not weird to say the most fucked up shit
00:37:37 to get me out for sex.
00:37:38 They don't even know why you're bringing that up.
00:37:39 I thought it was perfect for fun.
00:37:41 All right, I got a question.
00:37:43 I got a question.
00:37:44 Oh, Nikki wants water.
00:37:45 Remember, I thought she wanted the microphone.
00:37:46 She just wants some water.
00:37:47 She must be sweating a lot.
00:37:48 Okay, all right, okay.
00:37:49 All right, debut.
00:37:51 Yeah?
00:37:52 That would back...
00:37:53 More like Dupu.
00:37:56 There it is.
00:37:57 Nailed it.
00:37:58 I've been holding that one in all night.
00:37:59 Hey, that's what you're gonna say tonight, aren't you?
00:38:02 Oh, hey.
00:38:03 All right, everybody, shut up.
00:38:04 Give, go on.
00:38:06 Would that idea work also with somebody
00:38:09 who was just a vegetable?
00:38:11 Like they had brain damage and they can't move.
00:38:13 Not as good, no, not as good, no.
00:38:15 All right, why is the diaper part of that then?
00:38:17 What...
00:38:18 Why is that?
00:38:19 I don't think they're tart enough
00:38:20 to be needing to wear diapers.
00:38:23 It's just kind of a, I guess, sort of an indicator
00:38:25 of the low level that they're functioning at,
00:38:27 sort of if they need that, you know.
00:38:28 But it's only attractive if you know it's an illusion,
00:38:32 because if it was like an actual person,
00:38:33 you wouldn't want to do, right?
00:38:35 Right.
00:38:36 Maybe.
00:38:37 Yeah, so yeah, I can see that.
00:38:37 Maybe he slips that in.
00:38:39 Well, if there was a real 20-year-old girl
00:38:43 who actually fell off a motorcycle without a helmet
00:38:46 and became retarded and wore diapers,
00:38:48 who would want to have sex with her?
00:38:50 Well, okay, all right, all right,
00:38:51 let's not put this position.
00:38:52 Guys, you gotta listen to me on this, okay?
00:38:55 Because there's nothing wrong with being attracted
00:38:57 to the most fucked up shit.
00:38:59 But it's not like you have to,
00:39:01 even if you admit that you're attracted to something,
00:39:04 that doesn't mean that you're going to like
00:39:05 fuck a person who meets these people.
00:39:07 Yeah, I wasn't, like, it's okay to be attracted to it.
00:39:10 I was asking if you would actually rape this retarded person.
00:39:13 I don't think-
00:39:14 No, because I would feel bad.
00:39:14 If I was brought up in a society
00:39:16 for whatever reason rape was not frowned upon, then yeah,
00:39:20 but that's not the case.
00:39:22 You know, that's all we need.
00:39:23 That's all we need.
00:39:24 Let's keep going.
00:39:25 Because I mean, like, it's not like,
00:39:26 oh, I'm not doing it because I'm not allowed to.
00:39:28 It's like, because people would feel bad about it,
00:39:30 I would feel bad about it, right?
00:39:31 Okay, everybody needs to understand,
00:39:33 if you raise in a culture where like you,
00:39:35 when you get older, like you and your brother
00:39:36 have to fight and you have to kill each other
00:39:38 and the winner gets the inheritance or whatever,
00:39:40 like you would do that.
00:39:41 Like that's, that's what we're talking about.
00:39:42 Like being in an immoral culture,
00:39:44 we understand of course that these things are not good
00:39:46 that you shouldn't do them in real life, but like-
00:39:49 But if society thought it was okay, we would just do it.
00:39:51 Well, if society thought you could do things
00:39:53 that you wanted to do that aren't okay now,
00:39:55 then you would do them too.
00:39:56 Like that's just how humans work.
00:39:57 It is.
00:39:58 Oh no, I'm totally on board.
00:39:59 Why are you so defensive?
00:40:00 I'm on board.
00:40:01 I'm on board of people getting involved, like doing,
00:40:02 like, like, but when it comes to not doing harm,
00:40:04 like, you know, maybe do I Google like medical journals
00:40:07 of parents raising their retarded children
00:40:09 and jack off to that?
00:40:10 Sometimes potentially, you know, I don't know.
00:40:14 Sometimes we've all been there, Nate.
00:40:16 This is fascinating.
00:40:17 Why are you freaking out?
00:40:18 I'm not freaking out.
00:40:19 I'm just making sure people understand.
00:40:20 That's my only goal.
00:40:21 I understand completely.
00:40:22 It's very much not as bad to say out loud,
00:40:27 but the same sort of things sometimes happens
00:40:29 with me with like breast expansion and stuff
00:40:31 where I would look at charts of like the average cup sizes
00:40:35 over certain decades and I would jack off exclusively
00:40:39 to the idea that breasts in general are getting bigger.
00:40:41 Yeah.
00:40:42 Oh yeah, man.
00:40:43 That's kind of funny.
00:40:44 I mean, like, okay, I want to talk about sequences
00:40:45 for a second because like there was some like medium sized
00:40:47 kerfuffle on the internet a few years back
00:40:49 over like some image that was meant for Tumblr alone,
00:40:53 but somehow found its way into the SJW anti SJW sphere
00:40:57 on Twitter and Facebook and such.
00:40:59 Of an image sequence.
00:41:00 It was probably Sargon of Akadu leaked it.
00:41:02 Of like this girl who's like a bimbo, a gyaru,
00:41:05 or however you say it.
00:41:06 Gyaru, yeah.
00:41:07 And she slowly transforms into becoming shorter,
00:41:09 smaller, pail, darker haired, glasses wearing,
00:41:14 book carrying, right?
00:41:15 And you look at it.
00:41:16 Are you sure it wasn't the other way around?
00:41:17 Doesn't she become the bimbo?
00:41:19 No, it's the other way around.
00:41:19 Wait, no, it's the other way around.
00:41:21 I remember specifically.
00:41:22 And like.
00:41:23 Okay, if you say so.
00:41:23 And like for me at first,
00:41:25 because I had heard about it in the context of this SJW fight,
00:41:27 I was like, oh wait, huh?
00:41:29 Is that trying to send this message of fucking,
00:41:32 it's important to not be attractive and be bogus instead?
00:41:35 But then I looked at it more closely.
00:41:36 I'm like, oh, it's a transformation sequence.
00:41:38 And I posted it without context on the PCP chat
00:41:41 and Gib was like, oh hey, it's a transformation sequence.
00:41:44 It's a very classic medium of like,
00:41:46 have point A to point B, you show the steps.
00:41:48 You know, maybe they turn into a pig,
00:41:50 they turn into like twice their age,
00:41:52 two characters merge into one, you know, that kind of thing.
00:41:54 It's the sequence of events
00:41:57 that itself can be attractive.
00:41:59 Yeah.
00:42:00 And I remember people got mad about that
00:42:01 cause, okay, I honestly can't remember
00:42:02 which step came first,
00:42:04 but like she went from like what appears to be like a smart,
00:42:07 I mean, she gets a tan or like she loses her tan,
00:42:11 but people took that to be like a racial thing that like,
00:42:13 she's like becoming like people thought it was that,
00:42:16 which it wasn't at all.
00:42:17 She just like got a tan
00:42:18 and became like a sexy housewife or whatever.
00:42:20 Yeah, I mean, it was a racist thing.
00:42:22 It was a racial thing.
00:42:22 It was a fetishistically racial thing,
00:42:24 not a politically racial one.
00:42:26 I'm not sure I agree with that.
00:42:28 I mean, maybe that's true,
00:42:29 but it looked to me like she just got a tan.
00:42:31 Yeah.
00:42:32 But okay, but putting that aside,
00:42:33 like it doesn't matter either way.
00:42:34 It's about the transformation and that's it.
00:42:36 I was thinking about like why it is that like growth
00:42:40 and like big things getting bigger
00:42:42 and like not getting smaller,
00:42:43 like getting smaller is bad.
00:42:44 I don't like that.
00:42:45 But getting bigger is good.
00:42:47 And I was thinking probably that stems from-
00:42:48 Is it because you want to be bigger?
00:42:50 Is that like a personal thing maybe?
00:42:51 I don't know.
00:42:52 I think it might stem from the fact that I'm just small
00:42:54 and I'm used to people being bigger.
00:42:56 And the idea of a giant woman is pretty good, you know?
00:42:59 Giant woman.
00:43:00 Like that Steven Universe episode.
00:43:01 Yeah.
00:43:02 Oh man.
00:43:03 See, that's the first one I ever saw.
00:43:04 Oh man.
00:43:05 I like that a lot.
00:43:05 And I thought, you know,
00:43:06 this is going to be good jerk off material later on.
00:43:09 We were talking about relating,
00:43:10 connecting empathizing with the guy in the fucking thing.
00:43:13 You know, you also have like the contrast of the fantasy.
00:43:16 I'm sure a lot of people are like,
00:43:17 well I want a guy who's all attractive and muscular
00:43:19 because that's what I want to be.
00:43:20 And of course that's obviously why dicks are so big.
00:43:23 You know, as a potential alleged,
00:43:25 slightly above average dick user myself, right?
00:43:30 That has no appeal to me.
00:43:31 And honestly, I just look at like a 10 inch dick
00:43:33 and I'm like, whatever.
00:43:34 Small penis humiliation, SPH as it's called on D,
00:43:39 is pretty good.
00:43:40 I'm really down for that.
00:43:41 Like when like the anime girl just grabs the dick
00:43:43 and it's like, this is it?
00:43:45 Wait, isn't it going to get, wait, it's already hard?
00:43:48 Huh, I don't think this is meant to go inside a girl.
00:43:50 Because from your perception,
00:43:51 that's such a fantastical situation
00:43:53 that you would never find yourself in.
00:43:56 Yeah, of course.
00:43:57 We got a real Mike Matei over here is, you know.
00:44:00 Yeah, wait, what the fuck does that mean?
00:44:03 Mike Matei has a huge cock.
00:44:04 He does?
00:44:05 That's canon.
00:44:06 Yeah, it's like 11 inches long.
00:44:07 You can see it in a video when he shows it off.
00:44:09 Oh, really?
00:44:10 I haven't seen that, but.
00:44:11 Yeah, he tells James like that his wife loves it.
00:44:14 Well, that's nice.
00:44:15 Yeah, cause James Rolfe is a cuckold.
00:44:17 Well, that's true.
00:44:18 Okay, well let's move on.
00:44:19 I have another one, like a whole separate topic
00:44:22 that I wanted to bring up.
00:44:23 And I know this has been discussed many times
00:44:25 by various members of our organization here,
00:44:27 but I want to talk about anthropomorphization,
00:44:30 specifically when it comes to like animals and shit.
00:44:32 And I just want to make a broad point at first,
00:44:34 at least how I look at this stuff.
00:44:36 I mean, and several of us have made videos about this,
00:44:39 but like when I, like for example, my little pony, right?
00:44:42 Okay, so those, those, those.
00:44:43 What's that?
00:44:44 That's, it's this, you know,
00:44:45 it's this famous Japanese anime you probably have.
00:44:47 But it's.
00:44:48 Oh, don't they have a movie coming out soon
00:44:49 that we're all going to go review together?
00:44:51 I'm pretty.
00:44:52 I'm pretty excited.
00:44:53 On an ABAP channel.
00:44:53 There's going to be some things.
00:44:54 There's going to be some things happening with that movie.
00:44:55 Uh-oh.
00:44:56 I'm very excited for it.
00:44:57 But so like when I jack off to my little pony,
00:45:00 as I do all the time, like what, what I'm jacking off to
00:45:05 is their human characteristics that are attractive to me.
00:45:09 It like, there's no difference to me
00:45:11 between jacking off to like, I don't know, rarity
00:45:14 or like some anime character,
00:45:17 because neither of them are exactly human.
00:45:19 So what you're jacking off to is this sort of representation
00:45:22 of a human female, which I find sexually appealing
00:45:25 because I am a human male and I am programmed
00:45:28 to respond to these things.
00:45:29 Like they've got a pussy.
00:45:30 There it is.
00:45:31 The hood, the mane, the cutie mark.
00:45:33 Yeah, exactly.
00:45:34 All those human things.
00:45:35 Their faces.
00:45:36 To me, like anthropomorphization is so like banal.
00:45:41 It's like.
00:45:42 Exactly.
00:45:43 A lot of the time it's really just surface level features.
00:45:46 As long as they have tits, you know.
00:45:50 But the ponies don't have tits.
00:45:52 Okay, but if you doggy style fuck them,
00:45:53 then you just look at their ass,
00:45:54 but you just look like a human ass.
00:45:56 No, no, no.
00:45:57 Like the anthropomorphize images of ponies
00:46:01 as if they were humans, they're just girls with tits
00:46:04 and what are you talking about?
00:46:06 Well, I'm kind of talking about like.
00:46:07 Are you fucking free?
00:46:08 I'm talking about the ponies themselves
00:46:10 and the way they have human character,
00:46:12 like they aren't just horses.
00:46:13 They're like this cartoonified version of horses
00:46:15 that have a lot of human characteristics.
00:46:18 Come on.
00:46:19 Well, I made a video about that many years ago.
00:46:21 And I think it was great.
00:46:23 I'd love that video.
00:46:23 I think it made a lot of good points.
00:46:24 I think the appeal makes a lot more sense.
00:46:26 It's much more apparently obvious, self-evident
00:46:29 if you check out monster girls.
00:46:30 And I mean, monster moves that made the show
00:46:32 will immediately educate you as to the appeal,
00:46:34 which is you're getting everything that,
00:46:36 usually 75 to 85% of everything
00:46:39 that you like about human girls
00:46:40 with some cool animal features tacked on.
00:46:44 So it's like the idea of like,
00:46:45 man, wouldn't it be cool if you could ride your girls back
00:46:48 and like she's perfectly comfortable
00:46:50 taking you around town like that, you know?
00:46:53 How would it feel to be fucking her from behind
00:46:55 but so far behind that her head's all the way
00:46:57 like fucking over there
00:46:57 because she's a goddamn horse, right?
00:46:58 She's a centaur baby, right?
00:47:00 That's the thing that like.
00:47:02 Spider girls are pretty good.
00:47:04 Rockin' air is great.
00:47:05 Rockin' air is great.
00:47:06 Best girl, lover, she's a beauty.
00:47:07 I like Lola Bunny.
00:47:09 You could do her Bunny style
00:47:10 and then play human basketball with her.
00:47:14 Wait, what's Bunny style?
00:47:15 Is that where they fell?
00:47:16 You just jumble, get into that and fetish his part too.
00:47:18 Okay.
00:47:22 Well, I mean, that's pretty much my entire point.
00:47:24 I just want to kind of go over that.
00:47:25 Like, yeah, I will jack off to furries all the time.
00:47:28 I'm not a furry at all,
00:47:30 but I have absolutely no problem
00:47:31 like jacking off to a furry.
00:47:32 But the furry doesn't necessarily.
00:47:33 I mean, like.
00:47:34 Yeah, like that's not what I'm into.
00:47:34 I'm into like the female human aspects.
00:47:36 Oh yeah, there's plenty of furry stuff.
00:47:38 The further furry it gets, the furrier it gets,
00:47:40 the more I have a hard time with it.
00:47:42 Some ears, nothing, right?
00:47:44 Some fur on the skin, as long as the art's good.
00:47:47 Muscles, you better have a really hot context
00:47:50 and some good dialogue that I'm gonna be able to jack off to,
00:47:52 or I can't go any further, right?
00:47:56 And like sometimes I specifically seek out furry art
00:47:59 because it has its own culture, its own style,
00:48:02 and sometimes I'm into some of the things it does.
00:48:03 Furry art is way more just abrupt
00:48:06 with getting to the point of what it wants,
00:48:08 at least like in the whole diaper zone,
00:48:10 like art that is both furry and diaper,
00:48:12 is just way more like, all right, here's what you want.
00:48:15 Boom, crank it up to 11.
00:48:16 Furry art tends to crank things up to 11
00:48:18 and be even more shameless and direct.
00:48:21 What's that, Gib?
00:48:23 Now I've noticed that as well,
00:48:24 like furry art is like always like.
00:48:26 Shameless.
00:48:28 Like, they're huge.
00:48:30 Yeah.
00:48:31 It's huge, every time, every single thing that they could be.
00:48:35 Right, so I was on a pretty big furry kick
00:48:37 for like a week, a month or two ago,
00:48:39 because I was just really into a shamelessness kick.
00:48:41 And the furry community provides that.
00:48:44 You know what's like a good example of that?
00:48:46 For many, many years,
00:48:47 there's been a vast shortage of like Kingdom Hearts porn,
00:48:51 but like Kingdom Hearts furry porn.
00:48:53 Now there's a diverse community out there.
00:48:55 Really? That's it.
00:48:57 To some extent.
00:48:58 I mean, I'm not an expert,
00:48:59 but like I feel like I've seen at least as much,
00:49:01 if not far more.
00:49:02 Is there the Lion King in that?
00:49:03 Is that one?
00:49:05 Well, Sora does become a lion in Kingdom Arts 2,
00:49:07 which you should play and find out yourself,
00:49:09 because it's pretty cool.
00:49:11 Does somebody have sex with the Keyblade?
00:49:14 The Keyblade is not too involved in this situation.
00:49:17 You just gotta be a porn of a woman fucking.
00:49:19 I have a key fetish, so that's my problem.
00:49:20 An actual Keyblade model, right?
00:49:22 It's gotta be somewhere.
00:49:23 Probably.
00:49:24 People who are into like fucking metal things
00:49:27 are probably called Shinies, right?
00:49:30 Oh, they're called by that, maybe.
00:49:32 Well, when it comes to like,
00:49:34 my mind as a porn consumer of my mind,
00:49:38 crows are into shiny porn.
00:49:40 Crows would be into that.
00:49:41 My mind, when it comes to Kingdom Arts 4,
00:49:43 if you wanted to involve the Keyblade,
00:49:44 it would be like some sort of situation
00:49:45 where they're like unlocking this
00:49:47 like ultimate Chastity Belt or something, you know,
00:49:50 where like you, the key is used to access the vagina
00:49:53 in some way, and Chastity Belt comes to mind.
00:49:54 You know, I'd go for something like that.
00:49:56 Or you could fucking with the Keyblade,
00:49:57 though it would be pretty uncomfortable.
00:49:58 It's not really shaped for that.
00:50:00 But you know, you get it.
00:50:01 Like, oh, sorry. Life finds a way.
00:50:03 What if you, yeah, go ahead and give.
00:50:06 What if it's like an anthropomorphized door
00:50:08 with a keyhole vagina?
00:50:10 Oh my God. Hell yeah.
00:50:11 Hell yeah. I've never seen that one, but.
00:50:13 That's a good idea.
00:50:14 Let's get to it, boys.
00:50:15 Let's get drawing.
00:50:16 Let's get writing.
00:50:18 That's the next draw cast.
00:50:19 That's a good idea.
00:50:21 Whichever. If all the artists in the audience
00:50:23 haven't been drawing everything we've been saying,
00:50:25 up to this point, they should be.
00:50:27 If any of you. I need lots of fan art of Davoo
00:50:29 and his girlfriend pooping on each other.
00:50:31 Oh, no, that's just scat zone.
00:50:32 That's just the actual zone of like being
00:50:34 into the tactility of it.
00:50:35 That's too far. Don't do that.
00:50:36 No, no, no. That's really just for people
00:50:40 who want to have the feeling of it,
00:50:41 which I am not into at all.
00:50:42 That's why I'm pretty hesitant to do it.
00:50:44 It's like. Can we draw Davoo in a diaper?
00:50:46 Oh. I don't want to jack off to myself.
00:50:50 I mean, I guess.
00:50:50 I don't know what your girlfriend looks like, dude.
00:50:52 I can't draw her.
00:50:54 No one wants to jack off to like their own situation.
00:50:56 What's fascinating about porn is like the newness of it,
00:50:59 the fantasy of it that you can get involved with personally.
00:51:02 Yeah. Porn yourself.
00:51:03 I don't know.
00:51:04 I mean, there was a little porn
00:51:05 of drawing of my, of keg standard back in the day,
00:51:08 which was fine, but.
00:51:09 Nate, the other day,
00:51:10 somebody drew the art of you as a girl
00:51:13 and you jerked off to that in the PCP chat for like an hour.
00:51:16 But that's because that's.
00:51:17 It's different from your real life, yeah.
00:51:19 Fantasy and sexy and something?
00:51:20 Well, it's still you.
00:51:21 I definitely get turned on by PCP to the
00:51:23 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:51:25 Monkey. Hold the fuck on.
00:51:26 You tell, like, like rule 63 versions of yourself
00:51:30 are like some of the hottest things to jack off to.
00:51:33 Cause like, to know yourself.
00:51:35 It's not just you though.
00:51:36 It's girl you.
00:51:37 And contrary to popular belief,
00:51:39 there are actual differences between women and men.
00:51:42 Look it up.
00:51:42 Google is a big fan of this theory.
00:51:44 So, you know, like there's differences there
00:51:49 and we could explore them together
00:51:50 while I pound the shit out of her vagina.
00:51:52 I mean, I will say right now on my channel,
00:51:54 I'm doing an art contest to draw me as a girl
00:51:56 doing lesbian shit with Luna Lovegood.
00:51:58 But I, like I don't masturbate to it.
00:52:00 I just appreciate it.
00:52:02 But I guess I'm just not in that head space
00:52:03 of wanting to jerk off to myself.
00:52:05 I mean, if there was like a dogen
00:52:07 of like this female version of character of me
00:52:09 that someone had made, like I would absolutely
00:52:11 jack off to it without a doubt.
00:52:13 But like.
00:52:14 Get to work PCP.
00:52:15 You know, I've never been much of like
00:52:16 a jack off to picture kind of guy though.
00:52:18 That's just not really my.
00:52:18 I actually don't know whether I would
00:52:21 if it was like a girl version of me.
00:52:23 Yeah.
00:52:24 Well, I don't know why that's.
00:52:26 It depends on the situation though.
00:52:28 Like if it's me like editing a video
00:52:30 and like releasing it and I'm like,
00:52:31 yay, that was fun.
00:52:32 Also, I'm a girl.
00:52:33 Also, I'm going to suck this cock now.
00:52:35 Like.
00:52:36 Hell yeah.
00:52:37 Wait, just let her masturbate to yourself,
00:52:39 sucking a cock?
00:52:40 Well, if it's girl version of me,
00:52:42 that's one of the many sexual acts that she could do.
00:52:44 But the thing is, when you watch porn,
00:52:46 you imagine yourself as the dick,
00:52:47 but now you're imagining yourself as the person sucking.
00:52:50 Well, yeah.
00:52:51 No, no, no, no.
00:52:51 I'm still projecting.
00:52:52 You're sucking your own dick.
00:52:53 Exactly what you're sucking somebody else's dick.
00:52:55 I'm projecting myself in the situation
00:52:57 as the guy getting fucked by the gender swapped version
00:52:59 of myself.
00:53:00 Wait, so you're imagining you having sex with yourself.
00:53:03 Oh, come on.
00:53:03 This is basic shit.
00:53:05 I know that you've thought of this a thousand times yourself.
00:53:07 No, I haven't.
00:53:08 Oh, come on.
00:53:09 Come on.
00:53:10 What are you fucking talking about?
00:53:11 I'm thinking of girl version of me
00:53:13 and I'm thinking of me getting fucked by a dude.
00:53:15 I'm thinking, oh my god,
00:53:16 well, how would I feel being fucked with the vagina?
00:53:19 Okay, I am not thinking about it that way.
00:53:20 I'm not thinking about that.
00:53:22 You're thinking about sucking cock.
00:53:23 I'm thinking about like a female version of me
00:53:25 that exists that I could then fuck.
00:53:27 And that's what I'm, you know.
00:53:29 That's what I'm doing.
00:53:30 I mean, that is kind of like funny
00:53:32 because you are the best guy ever.
00:53:34 So of course you'd have enough of an ego
00:53:35 to want to fuck yourself.
00:53:37 Dude, every person in the world,
00:53:38 I don't believe that you don't want to fuck
00:53:40 your own gender swapped version of yourself.
00:53:42 Because everyone knows about it.
00:53:43 The girl version of me is going to be as ugly as me
00:53:46 and I have higher standards.
00:53:48 I'm a golden god.
00:53:49 I'm a fucking beautiful hero, man.
00:53:51 Don't push your beliefs onto me.
00:53:53 I don't want to fuck me.
00:53:54 I'm hideous.
00:53:54 You know what, that's fair.
00:53:55 I think I wear a monkey mask in these fucking videos, dude.
00:53:58 Yeah, all right.
00:53:59 Okay.
00:54:00 I don't want to fuck that.
00:54:01 I've had the thought because everyone has the idea.
00:54:04 Like what would it be like if you met
00:54:06 a female version of yourself?
00:54:08 Yeah.
00:54:09 And I'm just, all I think about is like the conversations
00:54:11 we would have or how awkwardly it would begin
00:54:14 or whether we would even want to hang around each other.
00:54:18 And then it doesn't really ever go further than that.
00:54:22 I don't know why it's so different for you
00:54:26 and for me.
00:54:27 Well, it's like a pair of twins
00:54:28 where one's a boy and one's a girl.
00:54:29 Like do they wanna fuck each other?
00:54:31 Is that masturbation?
00:54:32 Absolutely.
00:54:33 I do enjoy like,
00:54:35 I do kind of enjoy like the idea of me as a girl
00:54:39 just for the cute aspect.
00:54:41 Like seeing like drawings of me just gender bent,
00:54:44 just doing normal things.
00:54:45 Like just being a pretty girl.
00:54:46 Like yeah, that'll be nice.
00:54:48 That's cool.
00:54:49 I like that idea, the idea that I'm the other gender
00:54:54 and I just look better because, you know.
00:54:56 Yeah.
00:54:57 And of course when I play Pokemon,
00:54:58 I always play as the girl.
00:55:00 I'd rather be a girl,
00:55:01 but that doesn't mean I wanna fuck me.
00:55:03 And of course there's like a bit of a fantasy element to it.
00:55:05 Like, you know, you can like in your head
00:55:07 make your female version look like basically
00:55:09 whatever you want.
00:55:10 So like, yeah, of course that's real.
00:55:11 But like when I kind of think of this female version of me,
00:55:13 she's also an anime character.
00:55:15 So, you know, like that's, that's.
00:55:19 It's also my little pony.
00:55:20 Of course.
00:55:21 Yeah, anime.
00:55:22 I already covered that.
00:55:25 D'Voo, have you finished your big story yet?
00:55:28 Big story?
00:55:29 He's got the rolls points I think, right?
00:55:30 You said that he had like a whole thing planned out.
00:55:32 Oh, I've just been like taking down notes occasionally here
00:55:34 and there.
00:55:35 I have another one, which is like,
00:55:37 Hippo talked about like other emotions that get attached.
00:55:40 Because we are an hour in just to let you guys know.
00:55:42 That's true.
00:55:42 I'm looking at the waveform.
00:55:43 I'm paranoid about audio glitches.
00:55:45 So like Hippo was talking about how like things can be scary.
00:55:48 And I believe he was alluding to the idea
00:55:50 that it sort of enhances the emotions.
00:55:51 Like, gets your blood rolling a little bit faster.
00:55:54 And that can like, that can like, you know,
00:55:56 enhance the groin area action if you know what I mean.
00:55:58 It's like some subdom should, right?
00:56:00 Right.
00:56:01 And like, there are lots of things
00:56:02 that I'm just fascinated with in general,
00:56:04 that then also become fetishes.
00:56:06 They were like, hold on.
00:56:08 Wait a second.
00:56:10 Oh, anyway, there are things that I can.
00:56:12 Wait, what?
00:56:14 There are things that I can stick out?
00:56:15 Of course.
00:56:16 Sorry, there's just people walking around.
00:56:17 I haven't been, I haven't had like much of my own room
00:56:20 in the last handful of months.
00:56:21 Anyway, there are things I was fascinated with
00:56:26 for a long time, even like as a child.
00:56:28 And my body did whatever it could manage
00:56:31 to do to turn me on in some way.
00:56:32 It didn't have the resources yet, right?
00:56:34 There's just general fascinations, right?
00:56:36 Gender bending is definitely one of them.
00:56:38 The exploration of the other sex back and forth
00:56:41 is a very interesting concept for me.
00:56:44 So much, I'm just really so obsessed with that concept
00:56:46 that it pisses me off when it shows up
00:56:49 in a piece of media because it's always done
00:56:51 as a joke or for quick fan service
00:56:54 or for like some sort of sitcom-y thing,
00:56:56 although Ranma One Half,
00:56:57 and never really explored as a real theme,
00:57:01 as a real narrative, right?
00:57:02 And I love it when it's really talked about,
00:57:04 when it's really like explored
00:57:05 like in an interesting, intimate way,
00:57:07 but it's almost never done that.
00:57:09 And it always teases me so, it pisses me off so bad,
00:57:12 both for my dick and for my heart,
00:57:14 because I find it a fascinating concept.
00:57:16 And so I feel like I'd never be able to like
00:57:18 watch Ranma One Half.
00:57:19 I'm even really hesitant about watching Your Name
00:57:21 because I know it's gonna have that thing.
00:57:23 And I know they're not gonna really explore that in depth.
00:57:25 They're just gonna have some scenes that tease me
00:57:27 and I'll just be left frustrated, right?
00:57:30 But what I wanna do, and I have done sometimes,
00:57:32 is there are some, there's some ecchi fricking mongas
00:57:36 out there that really explore it.
00:57:37 There's one where this guy gets into the body
00:57:39 of like a seven-year-old girl.
00:57:41 And like, it's great.
00:57:43 For the first, it's called Ichinense Nina Chaturla.
00:57:46 And it's like almost every page is in service
00:57:50 of either your dick or like feeling the concept
00:57:53 of what it would be to suddenly be
00:57:54 in this different body, right?
00:57:55 And so what does he do as the seven-year-old girl?
00:57:58 Oh, he'll go to school, but still secretly study
00:58:00 for his exams in high school,
00:58:02 because that's what he has to do.
00:58:03 Hang on.
00:58:04 How's that sexual?
00:58:06 Yes, I think I may have seen that,
00:58:09 or seen something very similar.
00:58:10 I think I told you about it, yeah.
00:58:12 No, but it was like this idea
00:58:15 that this guy got transformed into the body
00:58:18 of a little girl or a little boy, I forget.
00:58:21 But it was like, he thought it was great
00:58:27 because like, oh, I'm younger now,
00:58:29 and I have all this future knowledge.
00:58:31 But then slowly, his like future knowledge
00:58:34 started to go away as you realize
00:58:35 that he had a child's brain.
00:58:36 You're gonna have to find that and link that to me.
00:58:38 Because then he was like,
00:58:41 oh, I don't know how to count anymore.
00:58:44 What's going on?
00:58:45 Oh my God, I had to read that one.
00:58:47 I don't even know what it was.
00:58:48 It may have been like, it was years ago
00:58:50 that I think I've seen that.
00:58:51 Yeah, that's definitely not the one I'm referring to.
00:58:54 Now, I was gonna talk about age regression.
00:58:56 That's just my outright favorite concept in anything.
00:58:59 Mental thought, hypotheticals, science fiction,
00:59:02 fetishes, anything.
00:59:03 That's my favorite thing ever.
00:59:05 The series movie 10 has a bunch of age regression
00:59:08 of all the characters,
00:59:09 but especially Nami becomes a little baby girl
00:59:11 and Robin goes from like 30 to like 27 or something.
00:59:15 It looks, no, she goes like 16.
00:59:17 She goes exactly the same, but it's amazing.
00:59:19 14.
00:59:19 See, the same problem.
00:59:20 It would just piss me off
00:59:21 because it wouldn't go deep enough.
00:59:23 What about Benjamin Button?
00:59:24 There's a whole movie about that.
00:59:25 I actually didn't finish that movie.
00:59:26 I mean, it's a dude, I'm not like, you know.
00:59:29 Yeah, I didn't finish.
00:59:30 Yeah, I love it.
00:59:31 But anyway, yeah, like so the manga I mentioned before,
00:59:35 Ichi Nensei Nina Chattara.
00:59:37 It's like probably the most complicated Japanese title
00:59:39 I can enunciate.
00:59:41 I know Nichi Nensei means first year.
00:59:43 That's what I know, folks.
00:59:44 There you go.
00:59:45 Right, so he, like in the second,
00:59:47 the book always refers to him as he,
00:59:49 just because he never accepts it, right?
00:59:51 He eventually gets cured at the very end.
00:59:53 But like-
00:59:54 Because as we all know, gender is what you identify as
00:59:56 as opposed to your biology.
00:59:57 This is what it all just did.
00:59:58 Right, so chapter two, he like wakes up and like-
01:00:00 Nate, shut up.
01:00:01 And like starts walking around the room
01:00:02 and like immediately, like it has all this dissonance
01:00:05 with how many steps it takes to get from place to place,
01:00:09 how much he has to reach to grab shit.
01:00:11 And like just, it always explores like
01:00:13 how different things feel for him.
01:00:15 There's a part where like, he has to like jump up
01:00:17 on a pole to like save himself.
01:00:19 And he like-
01:00:19 Oh, he's jumping up on that pole.
01:00:20 How can we tell you about that?
01:00:22 Well, yeah, but what happens is that
01:00:23 as he's holding to the pole really tightly,
01:00:25 he's like, oh man, in my old body,
01:00:27 this would like, I'd be feeling the pressure
01:00:29 against my dick right now and this would be fun.
01:00:31 But in this body, it doesn't do anything for me, right?
01:00:33 Oh, they're going deep.
01:00:34 There's like a multiple part chapter
01:00:35 where he's like tries to figure out whether or not
01:00:37 he can like, you know, masturbate
01:00:39 in that young girl's body or not, right?
01:00:41 So like, it's like, it's just constantly exploring
01:00:43 like what is happening to him.
01:00:46 And that's what I want.
01:00:47 I actually found out about it, I think from D
01:00:49 because someone posted a comment saying,
01:00:51 I really, what I really want out of age regression
01:00:54 and like transgender stories is not so much just going ham
01:01:00 on the fan service as much as explore
01:01:03 what happens to their life.
01:01:04 Like show them hanging out, right?
01:01:05 I remember some people talking about they like it
01:01:07 when like a guy gets turned into a woman
01:01:09 and it just stays like that for years and has kids, right?
01:01:11 That's what I really want to see.
01:01:12 I want to see like Bruce Jenner.
01:01:14 Yeah, exactly.
01:01:15 So that's, and then for me, it's like, I don't know
01:01:20 that exploration of being in a different body
01:01:22 of having that like age taken away from you
01:01:26 is a very fascinating concept
01:01:28 that is definitely my least favorite thing about reality
01:01:32 is it doesn't have that or gender-bending remotes.
01:01:34 I know for months, I mean, I know for months
01:01:36 like gender bender and age regression remote
01:01:38 should be a real thing was a suggested title topic for PCP.
01:01:42 That's true.
01:01:44 Next week.
01:01:45 No, we already did that.
01:01:47 There's not really much to say about it at this point.
01:01:49 We did gender swapping, right?
01:01:50 Yeah, so like the fact that I'm so into it as a concept
01:01:53 gives it so much allure,
01:01:54 even if somewhere were to just cut off my dick.
01:01:56 And like the fact then that it also feeds into it, right?
01:02:00 And it creates this feedback loop
01:02:02 of still having a burning passion for it
01:02:05 even after I'm done.
01:02:06 I'm still thinking about it being like, yeah.
01:02:08 You know what I mean?
01:02:11 Oh, I know what you mean.
01:02:13 Well, all right, there you go.
01:02:16 All right, let's, anybody got some final points to make
01:02:18 on this before we go to questions?
01:02:19 I think it's about that time.
01:02:21 Well, I could talk a little bit more
01:02:22 about the whole like giant woman thing
01:02:24 because I didn't really say anything about that.
01:02:26 Okay, let's do it.
01:02:28 Well, I think I like the idea of like girls
01:02:32 that are taller than me, which is usually,
01:02:34 it's the other way around, like the short girl
01:02:36 is the cute one and you got to be a tall man,
01:02:38 but I'm not tall.
01:02:39 And I've always annoyed that the fact that I'm not tall
01:02:42 because it seems like tall guys get everything.
01:02:45 So it was like-
01:02:46 Don't worry, manlight uprising is coming.
01:02:48 Don't worry.
01:02:49 Yeah, yeah, at some point I just-
01:02:51 You can finish what Allie gets started.
01:02:52 That's right.
01:02:54 Like the idea that a woman could be like bigger than me
01:02:58 and like, you know, put our arms around me
01:03:02 and then cradle me like an idiot,
01:03:03 like a stupid, small little man.
01:03:06 Sure. I don't know.
01:03:07 Do you masturbate to the P-E-T-A sculpture?
01:03:10 The what?
01:03:11 The P-E-T-A where it's the Virgin Mary
01:03:15 and she's like nine feet tall,
01:03:16 cradling a little tiny Jesus.
01:03:19 Oh.
01:03:19 Someone should draw that picture
01:03:21 and replace Jesus with a gift.
01:03:23 You have to do it.
01:03:25 Someone, please.
01:03:26 Please give me hippo in the P-E-T-A.
01:03:30 I guess I didn't really have much to say about it.
01:03:32 I like giant stuff.
01:03:34 I like big things.
01:03:36 It's good.
01:03:36 Big things from a small packages, Gib.
01:03:39 Yeah, that's why my last girlfriend broke up with me.
01:03:41 She liked big things too.
01:03:45 The big things coming small packages argument
01:03:47 wasn't really enough for her when I, you know-
01:03:49 She wasn't buying it.
01:03:51 She didn't give a fuck about the motion of the ocean.
01:03:55 She wanted the wave.
01:03:56 It's sad, but true, folks.
01:03:58 Let's all kill ourselves.
01:04:00 Okay, let me just finish.
01:04:02 I just want to make one final point
01:04:03 just to sum up what I was saying before.
01:04:04 Remember, folks, it's totally normal
01:04:06 to be in all kinds of weird fucked up shit.
01:04:08 A lot of it just stems from the experiences
01:04:10 you have in your life, you know?
01:04:11 Yeah.
01:04:12 I'm sure that's an explanation for most of the reason
01:04:13 why I'm into the stuff that I'm into sexually.
01:04:17 Not that I'm that weird or anything,
01:04:18 but yeah, just, I don't know, don't shame anybody.
01:04:21 This is all totally normal, you know?
01:04:22 I think it's pretty normal.
01:04:23 Don't shame anybody, but if they rape a retarded person,
01:04:27 do arrest them.
01:04:28 I agree.
01:04:29 Yeah, I do endorse that, by the way.
01:04:30 I'm not, I'm saying that should be arrested,
01:04:32 that that wouldn't be allowed, that should be allowed.
01:04:34 As Davoo slyly slides away his proposition
01:04:37 to make rape illegal,
01:04:39 just slide that under my desk here.
01:04:42 All right, well that's it.
01:04:44 That would be the great PCP civil war
01:04:46 is that Davoo wants to make rape legal
01:04:48 and Munchy wants to make sex outline.
01:04:50 Yeah!
01:04:51 He'll have to go to war.
01:04:52 That's a great idea.
01:04:53 It'll just be like in the near future
01:04:54 where probably smoking will be banned
01:04:54 and weed will be legal everywhere.
01:04:56 Everything just gets flip-flopped,
01:04:57 you know what I mean?
01:04:58 See, if there is a war, I can't be on Munchy's side
01:05:01 because people always confuse us for each other
01:05:03 and I'll probably get assassinated
01:05:04 when they're trying to get him.
01:05:05 That's true, that's true.
01:05:07 Wouldn't it be even worse if,
01:05:08 even if you were on the opposite side,
01:05:09 they still assassinate you by mistake?
01:05:12 Now that would be bad.
01:05:12 Somebody on my team.
01:05:13 Exactly.
01:05:14 That would be real, you see.
01:05:15 So actually a war of people who like sex
01:05:18 and people who don't like sex
01:05:19 would instantly, well, not instantly,
01:05:21 but eventually the people who like sex would win
01:05:23 because they would make more soldiers.
01:05:25 Exactly.
01:05:26 But then again, maybe it's a good point.
01:05:27 Maybe our heroic virgins, like Isaac Newton types,
01:05:30 like they would all get together in advanced science
01:05:32 by like a thousand years
01:05:33 because they're not distracted
01:05:34 by disgusting sex havers anymore.
01:05:36 Maybe that would happen, you know?
01:05:37 Those heroic virgins, like Elliot Raj
01:05:40 or the Columbine kids.
01:05:42 Yeah, exactly.
01:05:43 The Columbine kids are heroes.
01:05:45 Elliot Raj would have been a fine warrior
01:05:47 if he had a cause to wave his, you know,
01:05:50 to a banner to wave, you know.
01:05:52 If he had a real card to batter people with.
01:05:55 He had some issues to sort out
01:05:57 beyond just his main thing.
01:06:00 He was pretty good at World of Warcraft.
01:06:01 Hey, no argument there.
01:06:03 And who, what makes a man beyond his Warcraft account,
01:06:06 really, not much.
01:06:07 All right, let's go to our questions here, everybody.
01:06:09 Remember, hashtag askPCP, we do it every Saturday.
01:06:13 There you go.
01:06:14 Hey, can I come out with like a little bit of an announcement,
01:06:16 like to talk about some shit that's happening?
01:06:18 I was just checking my Twitter.
01:06:19 So, okay, here's some YouTube titles for you.
01:06:22 The big change in the anime industry
01:06:24 that has people, I can't read the rest.
01:06:26 Her potential is insane.
01:06:28 He saved this one, dot, dot, dot.
01:06:31 Oh no.
01:06:31 You, five exclamation marks.
01:06:34 Digi has gotten into some Twitter beef
01:06:36 with some guy who doesn't like his thoughts
01:06:37 about this shit, about the whole anime streaming thing.
01:06:40 He's doing it publicly,
01:06:41 so I'm not breaking any boundaries here.
01:06:43 Now, I'm not gonna make any comment myself.
01:06:44 I haven't watched this guy.
01:06:45 His name is Forneverworld,
01:06:47 or as I like to call him, Forlorn Hope
01:06:49 that he'll ever get laid in his life.
01:06:51 He said, I'm not a bad YouTuber.
01:06:54 He said, I'm a bad YouTuber,
01:06:56 responding to Digi calling him a bad YouTuber.
01:06:58 He says, when you don't have to rely on clips and images
01:07:02 to get audience retention, come back to me.
01:07:05 Wait, wait, what?
01:07:06 I think he's referring to how Digi's videos,
01:07:08 like with Unate, like the podcasts,
01:07:11 get less views.
01:07:13 Listen, it's not because they don't have images.
01:07:15 I mean, that's part of it.
01:07:16 The fact that you don't rely on images
01:07:18 to get views of Forlorn Hope that you'll ever get laid
01:07:20 is that all of your videos have clickbait titles
01:07:24 and his do not as often.
01:07:26 So anyway, that's all I have to say about that.
01:07:28 I don't give a fuck about this beef
01:07:29 between Digi and this other guy,
01:07:31 but like, is he making a,
01:07:32 I don't understand the point.
01:07:33 Is he saying that it is bad to add clips
01:07:36 and images to your videos?
01:07:38 I don't understand. I think he was saying
01:07:40 that the only reason people watch your videos
01:07:44 is because you put clips in them.
01:07:46 Yeah, but you're one of those mainstream guys
01:07:48 who dole the senses of your audience
01:07:51 with a bunch of fancy clip keys dangling before their forehead.
01:07:55 That's why I don't understand the point
01:07:56 of what you said about like,
01:07:58 he's like, but that isn't an insult to the videos
01:08:01 of that's just a still image from one anime
01:08:04 that we just leave up and don't animate
01:08:06 because we're not editing anything.
01:08:08 Yeah, I'm looking at it.
01:08:09 It looks like all of his videos are just vlogs
01:08:11 with his big face in the camera, so.
01:08:14 Okay, well, this is a huge waste of time.
01:08:15 It's funny that I'm jumping into like,
01:08:18 putting my, like sticking my dick in this horrendous nest
01:08:20 on the podcast that is literally loaded
01:08:22 with the most material against me
01:08:24 that could possibly be posted.
01:08:26 Hey, fucking whatever.
01:08:28 Well, to be fair, you posted a picture
01:08:30 in this for never world guy.
01:08:32 His own chosen profile picture looks like a retarded person.
01:08:36 So I wouldn't feel too bad about what he has to say.
01:08:39 Yeah.
01:08:40 I don't give a shit about any of this.
01:08:43 Let's get to the question.
01:08:43 I just had to get that off my tongue.
01:08:45 Okay, here we go.
01:08:48 Okay, here's one.
01:08:50 At Aaron underscore fell asks,
01:08:52 why did you all pick your respective names?
01:08:54 Apart from Nate, we all know why.
01:08:56 I'm the best guy ever.
01:08:57 What can I say?
01:08:58 Shut the fuck up.
01:08:59 That's a good question.
01:09:03 Hippocrite was just a-
01:09:04 I've been trying to figure out the meaning behind that.
01:09:07 I can't tell what hippocrite means.
01:09:10 Please explain to me.
01:09:11 What do you mean to me?
01:09:11 It means that puns are awesome.
01:09:13 It means it's, I thought like critical hit
01:09:17 and also gaming critic.
01:09:20 Like critical hits are in games, gaming critic, crit
01:09:23 and hippocrite as in like it's an animal.
01:09:27 And I just thought of that one day out of nowhere
01:09:29 and I thought I gotta have that if that's gonna be,
01:09:32 I gotta keep that name.
01:09:33 So I made a YouTube channel.
01:09:34 Yeah.
01:09:35 So that I could, you know, keep it.
01:09:37 And then that's it.
01:09:38 Good boy.
01:09:39 I was protecting.
01:09:40 I thought it was because you always logically
01:09:42 contradicted yourself and we're acknowledging
01:09:44 that you were a hypocrite,
01:09:45 but also you are very bad at spelling.
01:09:47 Cause you're English.
01:09:48 Yes.
01:09:50 Yeah.
01:09:51 I'm surprised there's not like a you in there or something.
01:09:53 At the beginning, my thing was also
01:09:56 on top of all those other parts of the pun,
01:09:58 hippocrite as in I will say things hypocritically
01:10:03 so that in case I actually do be a hypocrite,
01:10:06 I could say, look, well, look at my name.
01:10:08 What are you gonna do?
01:10:08 Nigga, what is the channel called?
01:10:11 What are you fucking talking about?
01:10:12 You've got cover for life.
01:10:14 I haven't really utilized that at all
01:10:15 because the only way I'm a hypocrite
01:10:20 is that my name is hypocrite, but I'm not hypocritical.
01:10:24 That's true.
01:10:24 That's how I use it.
01:10:25 Oh, that makes sense.
01:10:27 Monkey, how'd you come up with this?
01:10:29 The appeal of Hippo's channel for me is that
01:10:31 he is so authentic and genuine with his love
01:10:33 for like the games he played when he was younger.
01:10:35 So I wouldn't like it if he started saying
01:10:38 hypocritical things like for a meme,
01:10:40 I had to take away from some of the magic.
01:10:42 I'm glad you haven't done that.
01:10:43 My name is, it was not chosen as a username.
01:10:47 It was a name thrust upon me in high school
01:10:51 by my so-called friends because they noticed
01:10:54 that I resemble both a human and a monkey.
01:10:57 So they went ahead and threw those words together
01:10:59 and it stuck and I embraced it and now that's me.
01:11:02 Oh, I didn't know that that came from friends or something.
01:11:05 That's pretty cool.
01:11:05 Yeah, I could see where they got that idea
01:11:08 from the way you look in videos.
01:11:11 You do kinda look like a monkey.
01:11:13 Yep, I'm very happy with it.
01:11:15 And it helps that I'm five foot seven
01:11:17 because I'm about the height of a monkey too.
01:11:19 Okay, DeVoo.
01:11:20 That's tall in me.
01:11:21 My username means that...
01:11:23 Well, yeah, but you're a gibbit.
01:11:24 You're smaller than a monkey.
01:11:24 That's true.
01:11:25 When I got on the internet,
01:11:26 I didn't really feel like having a username.
01:11:28 My first name was just my name, but condensed a bit.
01:11:32 But then my dad was like,
01:11:33 it just looks too much like your name.
01:11:35 It looks kind of dangerously Google-able.
01:11:36 I'm like, okay.
01:11:37 It's very interesting that your dad was giving you critiques
01:11:39 on your user names for your online activities.
01:11:42 I mean, it was like my name and then my last initials.
01:11:45 And he was like,
01:11:46 I don't know, that seems a little dangerously Google-able.
01:11:48 I'm like, you're right.
01:11:49 And I just had this, I don't know what day, what moment,
01:11:52 what fever dream, just the whole idea of taking my name,
01:11:54 which is David,
01:11:55 just changing the last syllable to an ooo came from.
01:11:58 And I just came up with it when I was 13
01:12:01 and never changed it.
01:12:02 Pretty fortunate,
01:12:03 because it seems to age pretty well.
01:12:05 Like the further I go on in my life,
01:12:06 it just seems to take on new meanings.
01:12:08 Like people, my PCP friends,
01:12:09 you guys tend to describe it as like sounding all mysterious,
01:12:12 like I'm some sort of abstract mythological beast.
01:12:14 Yeah.
01:12:16 Or like it rhymes with the dupu, which is a getup.
01:12:19 And that too.
01:12:21 I always thought of it as soon as I saw it,
01:12:23 I thought davoodoo, like he's a witch dog.
01:12:26 Oh, shit.
01:12:28 It reminds me a little bit of my friend John
01:12:30 that I reference sometimes on here.
01:12:31 He actually, he calls himself-
01:12:32 John Tron.
01:12:33 John Tron, that's right.
01:12:34 Yeah, he's a different John.
01:12:35 He calls himself John-os sometimes.
01:12:37 It's not his name.
01:12:38 He just came up with it
01:12:39 and introduces himself as John-os sometimes.
01:12:41 Nice.
01:12:42 No idea why.
01:12:43 Yeah, no, the part of my name that didn't age too well
01:12:45 is I was calling myself like the great davood,
01:12:48 because that's like internet,
01:12:49 making yourself all grandiose.
01:12:52 Usually because davood is usually taken from most websites,
01:12:55 cause I think it's like a Spanish word name or something.
01:12:57 So it's actually not, up until a couple of years ago,
01:13:01 my name was like very, very bad for Google.
01:13:04 Like, cause there'd just be like some,
01:13:05 I think it was some rapper called davooda producer
01:13:07 or whatever.
01:13:07 So it's not great for Googling.
01:13:10 But usually the davood is never taken.
01:13:12 So it's a perfect middle ground.
01:13:14 That's why the duff stuck around.
01:13:15 How great is it to finally beat Google
01:13:18 and overcome that like search result thing
01:13:20 when like, I remember for like a year
01:13:22 after starting Best Guy Ever,
01:13:23 like when I searched it,
01:13:24 all this other shit comes up that I didn't give a fuck about.
01:13:26 But now finally, I have conquered Google
01:13:29 and now my shit comes up.
01:13:30 But I've been noticing,
01:13:31 hypocrite does not come up initially
01:13:33 when you search hypocrite and it pisses me off.
01:13:34 It's all people misspelling it.
01:13:36 Yeah.
01:13:37 Or it auto-corrects to normal hypocrite.
01:13:39 It's one of the biggest tragedies.
01:13:41 I didn't even think about that.
01:13:43 It will be fixed in time.
01:13:44 You just have to grow more and that just works itself out.
01:13:46 You just have to grow more,
01:13:47 but just like all that art you look at it.
01:13:49 Exactly.
01:13:50 So I can jack off to it.
01:13:52 I was about to say though,
01:13:53 that the poddy curse actually came up
01:13:54 when I typed it in.
01:13:56 I was having that same problem.
01:13:57 That's great.
01:13:58 Do you have to put like the period after the D and shit?
01:14:00 No, I didn't.
01:14:01 Whoa.
01:14:02 Just put a space.
01:14:03 Well, fuck, I gotta try that out.
01:14:04 Uh, okay.
01:14:05 In my house, all the period comes before the D.
01:14:10 Okay, here we go.
01:14:11 At papa mutt dog asks,
01:14:14 is the vape pen Mike?
01:14:17 Shout out, you ruined my flow.
01:14:18 Is the vape pen mightier than the sword?
01:14:23 There's a vape sword?
01:14:24 Is the vape pen mightier than the sword?
01:14:26 Could you imagine, could you imagine a vape sword?
01:14:30 Like it's actually the size of a sword
01:14:32 and you blow or you suck on one side
01:14:34 and it comes out of the tip of the sword right at the end.
01:14:37 I imagine it's like just take this potion sword
01:14:39 and just go and hit people with it.
01:14:41 Saying vape sword reminds me of invisible air,
01:14:44 which is the name of saber sword from Fate, Stay Night,
01:14:46 which is actually just, it's actually just Excalibur,
01:14:49 but they pretend that it's invisible air.
01:14:50 I would like Ben to have a vape sword.
01:14:53 Me too.
01:14:54 It would be very, it would be very cool.
01:14:54 That would be his fucking,
01:14:56 that would be a striped sword.
01:14:57 I would like Ben to not be alive.
01:14:58 No, wait, a vape katana, there we go.
01:15:01 That would, that would,
01:15:02 Ben is practiced.
01:15:03 When he's been striped as a specimen,
01:15:05 it would be vape, it happens, right?
01:15:07 Well, Ben is practiced in the art of Kendo
01:15:10 and has maxed out his Bushido stat,
01:15:12 so he's ready for that vape katana.
01:15:15 Okay, here's the greatest comment.
01:15:16 This isn't a question, it's just a comment,
01:15:17 but at Jam Shmain, it's spelled kind of funny,
01:15:20 says, thanks for fat shaming me
01:15:23 into losing 10 pounds, hashtag fit boy.
01:15:25 Oh, shit.
01:15:26 Hell, yes, ya main man, Manny,
01:15:29 is his, like, his main thing.
01:15:30 Oh, well, that guy, I know him.
01:15:31 You, you're welcome, dude,
01:15:33 and I will continue on this quest
01:15:34 to fat shame everyone into getting their shit together,
01:15:37 cause there's no excuse to not, you know, be a fit person.
01:15:42 Excellent, thank God for you, you're a hero.
01:15:45 Oh, here we go, at Swagdude.
01:15:47 I don't know if you want to answer this, Davoo,
01:15:48 but he's asking, how's Davoo's video game going?
01:15:52 Oh, very, very slowly, I just keep, you know,
01:15:54 I'll spend just weeks at a time,
01:15:56 just editing videos and then watching anime.
01:15:59 It's definitely, like, I don't know
01:16:01 exactly what speed it's gonna take,
01:16:02 but I'm having a huge fun time with it.
01:16:04 I am learning the incredible power of, like,
01:16:07 and when you're a teenager, you have unlimited time,
01:16:09 but no purpose in life, so you're depressed,
01:16:11 you're too depressed to make anything and all that good.
01:16:13 Well, at least that's how I was.
01:16:14 As an adult, I have that sense of mission,
01:16:16 but the sense of mission and the needing to make money
01:16:17 can also sort of trap you,
01:16:19 it can keep you trapped in this need for money.
01:16:21 So, basically, I've made enough money to,
01:16:23 well, I have not really a decent amount of money,
01:16:26 but I have my own career now and I have all my spare time,
01:16:28 and so I've bought myself that teenage sort of lifestyle
01:16:31 to work on something because I want to make it
01:16:34 and it doesn't have to make its money back.
01:16:36 I think it might, because, I mean, I don't know,
01:16:38 probably only, like, 108 people are gonna buy it,
01:16:40 that's basically what I'm prepared for,
01:16:42 but it's so great to just have all this time
01:16:45 to make something that I want to make,
01:16:46 but yeah, it's going around very, very, very slowly.
01:16:49 Don't expect it out by the end of the decade.
01:16:52 The decade? Looking forward to it.
01:16:53 Hey, that's only three years, you know, it's not that bad.
01:16:55 Oh, I thought he meant, like, the next 10 years,
01:16:57 I was like, well, four.
01:16:58 Well, this decade's almost over,
01:16:59 so it probably won't be this day.
01:17:00 D'Vu, I want to be alive to play the game,
01:17:02 so please don't take 10 years, I'll be dead.
01:17:04 Yeah, definitely not taking that long, yeah.
01:17:05 Okay, here we go, Hindu, Hindu God of Homoes, as-
01:17:09 Oh, yeah!
01:17:10 Yeah, good, yeah.
01:17:11 Our boat's good, what is the best boat?
01:17:14 No, I love boats.
01:17:16 Boats, the best kind of boat is a boat that can fly.
01:17:21 And her name is Going Mary.
01:17:24 Going Mary is the best boat.
01:17:25 No, no, really, like, the idea of a pirate galleon
01:17:29 that has either magically or scientifically
01:17:32 the ability to fly through the air
01:17:34 is my favorite thing of all time.
01:17:35 Hey, you know what you would like then?
01:17:36 Final Fantasy, specifically Final Fantasy IX,
01:17:39 because it's full of those.
01:17:41 Well, there we go.
01:17:42 It's aesthetic as fuck.
01:17:43 You'd also like the music video Boats and Hose.
01:17:47 You gotta have me, my Boats and Hose,
01:17:49 I think is how it goes.
01:17:50 That's pretty good, that's pretty good.
01:17:52 Yeah.
01:17:53 Okay, okay, here's one.
01:17:55 At the Wolf Heart, hey, what's up, dude?
01:17:56 This guy's a good artist, man.
01:17:57 Between single and multiplayer,
01:17:59 do you think one is superior,
01:18:01 and does the lack of the other-
01:18:01 Single player is superior.
01:18:02 affect your interest in a game?
01:18:04 Single player will make me want to play.
01:18:06 Very singularly focused on single player games
01:18:09 for the most part, yes.
01:18:11 Yeah, multiplayer, as long as it's,
01:18:14 if it's turn-based multiplayer, like a card game,
01:18:16 it's okay, but generally,
01:18:18 the idea of playing online with people,
01:18:21 the internet fucks me over more often than I would like,
01:18:24 and it just annoys me.
01:18:25 I have an idea.
01:18:26 I'm back to having not viable internet,
01:18:28 so it doesn't even matter anyway.
01:18:29 You know what's funny about this?
01:18:30 I almost exclusively play single player games,
01:18:34 but I just so happened,
01:18:34 I got Splatoon 2 recently from my Switch,
01:18:37 which I have been playing more than any other video game,
01:18:41 which is to say, I'll play one or two games a day,
01:18:44 which is 15 minutes, but I'll still do it,
01:18:46 and it's fun, and I'm certainly playing
01:18:48 in more than any other game right now.
01:18:50 Of course, I did just beat Hollow Knight,
01:18:51 and that took 40 hours split out
01:18:53 over many weeks of playing, so.
01:18:56 I guess I should clarify,
01:18:57 competitive multiplayer games, I hate.
01:18:59 Playing on a Minecraft server with people, that's fun.
01:19:01 That is super fun, that is super fun.
01:19:03 I used to play League of Legends a lot,
01:19:05 but I just cut the time out because it's not fun,
01:19:07 and it sucks.
01:19:08 Didn't everybody say Splatoon 2 sucks?
01:19:11 Splatoon 2 is fun as fuck.
01:19:12 I mean, I bought it because-
01:19:13 Splatoon 2 splats.
01:19:14 The biggest complaint was that it's too much
01:19:16 like Splatoon 1, and it certainly is,
01:19:19 but the thing is, I never owned Splatoon 1,
01:19:21 so I just wanted to play this game all the time,
01:19:24 and I don't have a Wii U, so I needed to get Switch,
01:19:27 and I already had a Switch, so I bought Splatoon 2,
01:19:29 and it's exactly what I wanted,
01:19:30 and it delivered, and it's fucking great for me,
01:19:33 maybe not for everybody.
01:19:34 The only thing I know about new video games
01:19:36 is what video game Donkey tells me,
01:19:38 so I just assumed it sucked.
01:19:40 Yeah, he was one of the guys making the criticism,
01:19:43 I think, that's just like, it's not enough,
01:19:45 it's just like the same game again,
01:19:46 with some extra couple of things.
01:19:48 It's like a DLC that you got conned out at 50 bucks for.
01:19:52 For people who played Splatoon 1 and owned it,
01:19:54 and if they were buying this to get an upgrade
01:19:56 or get the new game, I can see why they'd be
01:19:58 a little disappointed, but I-
01:20:00 Like any Call of Duty game ever.
01:20:02 Yes.
01:20:03 Yeah, it's like, this is one of the only times
01:20:05 Nintendo's gonna pull this kind of fast one on people, so.
01:20:09 But like the flavor I loved, and I got to be around,
01:20:13 fuck, it's her name, Callia Marie, it's Marie.
01:20:14 Yeah, Marie is there, and she's cute as fuck,
01:20:16 and the squids are squids.
01:20:17 They're minerals, Marie.
01:20:19 I don't, I don't know.
01:20:20 Jesus Christ.
01:20:21 I don't know what that means, explain that.
01:20:22 That's from Breaking Bad.
01:20:23 Oh, good, excellent.
01:20:25 Good joke, good joke to end on, everybody.
