00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, a podcast
00:00:16 about internet people talking about stuff.
00:00:19 I'm the best guy ever and we're joined today by Munchy wears tiny hats.
00:00:24 Don't let my mom know I'm here, I'm sneaking out, I went to the, we're in the back of
00:00:29 a Barnes and Nobles where they sell the porn.
00:00:32 Don't let my mom know or she'll know that I have carnal sins and that she will kick
00:00:37 me out of my satertium.
00:00:39 Yes, excellent. Hippocrit is here.
00:00:42 I haven't eaten in hours and I have a burger in front of me and if I make a noise I'm sorry.
00:00:47 Okay, good. Tom Oliver is joining us.
00:00:51 You're not supposed to know I'm here, it's a secret.
00:00:55 Oh well now the cat's out of the bag, and Mumkey Jones.
00:00:59 Jon Tron just put up a new video!
00:01:05 One of you could go. Impressive shrieking.
00:01:09 Didn't I start to feel a riot?
00:01:12 Alright everybody, let's not fuck around.
00:01:15 Today our topic of discussion is, it's apropos that you mentioned Barnes and Nobles because
00:01:20 we're reviewing The Secret, the world-famous book that everyone loves that taught the world
00:01:25 to love again, to feel, to be a real guy.
00:01:29 I thought it was The Secret, like ooze and slime come out of it.
00:01:32 Like secreting ooze.
00:01:34 Yes, yes, that too, it's all these things.
00:01:36 When you said secret, the first thing I thought of was like secreting anal juices and I don't know why.
00:01:41 I don't know why juices are there besides poop or diarrhea.
00:01:44 There's a lot of anal juice you don't know about Nate, that's one of my secrets.
00:01:48 Got a lot to learn.
00:01:49 Well there you go, okay you know what, let's all scrap that.
00:01:51 The secret topic of the episode.
00:01:52 I forgot Hippo was eating.
00:01:54 Yeah, I was just gonna say.
00:01:56 Oh fuck you, this is what you get.
00:01:58 Oh, thank you.
00:01:58 I'm into eating fags.
00:02:00 So yeah, we're talking about secrets everybody.
00:02:02 We're talking about secrets.
00:02:03 That's the real secret of this episode.
00:02:04 And here is the Urban Dictionary definition of secret.
00:02:08 Here it is.
00:02:10 Can't tell you.
00:02:13 That's it, that's the whole thing.
00:02:14 Okay, here's definition number two.
00:02:15 Information, you tell someone when you spelled with just the letter you,
00:02:21 when you want it to become public knowledge by morning.
00:02:27 That's perfect because that's every story I have to tell about this topic.
00:02:31 Oh, that's good, that's good.
00:02:32 Yes, that is good.
00:02:33 I like this.
00:02:35 Secret, strong enough for a man made for a woman.
00:02:39 These are all great.
00:02:40 Urban Dictionary, you're killing it today buddy.
00:02:43 Urban Dictionary is the main success of the PCP, yeah.
00:02:47 Yeah, we owe them everything.
00:02:48 So secrets, they are good, they are bad, they are gay across the board.
00:02:56 What secrets do you have, Munchy?
00:03:00 I'm paranoid, just to start out.
00:03:02 I might be the most paranoid PCP member next to you, Nate.
00:03:06 I am very paranoid.
00:03:07 That's a tall order.
00:03:08 Yeah, yeah, you're more paranoid than I am.
00:03:11 But needless to say, whenever I look at someone,
00:03:14 I instantly just assume they want to kill me.
00:03:17 And therefore, I have to assert my dominance.
00:03:19 I have to have emotional power over them to ensure that they want to talk to me.
00:03:24 Therefore, it's in their best interest not to kill me.
00:03:27 I know just how you feel.
00:03:29 I don't trust anyone.
00:03:30 I don't trust anyone at any time.
00:03:32 And I need to know that I have leverage over them in some way, even if it's just social.
00:03:36 Yeah, that sounds good, man.
00:03:38 Yeah, yeah.
00:03:39 So, I don't really have a lot of secrets per se,
00:03:43 but I allow just knowledge.
00:03:45 I have knowledge and smarts and wisdom that I keep inside my brain.
00:03:49 And any person, and if you were to look inside my brain,
00:03:51 you'd be like, ooh, tasty, and you would slip it all up, and Jesus, get out of here.
00:03:56 I would say to you, prying into my brain.
00:04:00 Yeah.
00:04:01 I don't like it when people know things.
00:04:03 Even, common, I don't like it when textbooks are out.
00:04:07 I don't like it when people are learning.
00:04:08 So, basically, you're against non-secrets.
00:04:12 You think all information should be contained in the form of secrets
00:04:15 as no one should have access to it.
00:04:17 I'm against education and learning as a concept.
00:04:20 I'm against self-betterment in any sort of way.
00:04:25 The fake news advocate.
00:04:28 Oh, you're the number one champion of fake news in the world after Hillary Clinton, of course.
00:04:33 Incredible.
00:04:34 Let me get some hand sanitizer.
00:04:37 One not secrets.
00:04:39 I love hand sanitizer.
00:04:41 You guys don't have to be my friend to know that.
00:04:43 Everyone knows when I get out my dinner of hand sanitizer, and I just slip you down.
00:04:50 Okay, good.
00:04:51 Is anyone else have any secret story?
00:04:54 I mean, Mom, you were implying that you had a couple stories about secrets.
00:04:57 What do you got for us?
00:04:58 Well, last episode, during the incest discussion,
00:05:01 we all heard the great tale of how I got cucked by my best friend and his sister.
00:05:08 And that was supposed to be a big secret that she confessed to me
00:05:12 and made me promise I would not tell anybody.
00:05:14 And as Urban Dictionary, let us all know.
00:05:18 The next morning was when I pretty much let everybody know,
00:05:22 because here's the thing about secrets.
00:05:24 I would like to think that I'm pretty trustworthy.
00:05:27 I would like to think if somebody gave me a secret,
00:05:29 they didn't want me to tell anybody.
00:05:30 I would stay true to that.
00:05:32 However, and I think this is a rule that should apply to everybody.
00:05:36 If the secret somebody is confessing to you is something that completely fucks you over.
00:05:42 Like if a girlfriend is telling you, oh, here's the secret.
00:05:45 I cheated on you.
00:05:47 Why in the fuck would I be expected not to tell everybody?
00:05:50 That's the front page of Facebook tomorrow morning, my friend.
00:05:53 You know, I forget the name of it, but that reminds me of this great episode of the boondocks,
00:05:58 where like the two, I forgot the name of the two white guys who are played by like Samuel Jackson
00:06:02 and another guy.
00:06:04 Yeah, like, it's great.
00:06:06 It's great.
00:06:07 But that, like the episode is about, I forget the name of like the rule or whatever,
00:06:11 but it's about like Riley gets like his shit stolen by those guys.
00:06:15 Like they're huge assholes that just take his shit,
00:06:18 but like no one will talk to the cops.
00:06:20 Like no one's gonna, what's it called, snitch it, no snitch it.
00:06:23 That's sort of the word I'm looking for.
00:06:24 So it's all about how like these guys are like terrorizing the neighborhood
00:06:28 and everyone's like looking for them because they're just ruining everyone's fucking life.
00:06:32 But Riley insists on not being a fucking snitch.
00:06:35 And because he's like the only one to witness them.
00:06:37 And then I believe actually, okay, so they don't do anything necessarily bad to him,
00:06:40 but at the end of the episode, so they're just in general ruining the neighborhood,
00:06:44 which has a minor impact on Riley's life, which kind of sucks.
00:06:47 But then at the end of the episode, they just steal his bike and like ride off with it.
00:06:51 And he's just like, they just like treat him like a punk bitch and totally fuck him over.
00:06:55 And then the cops will walk up and they're like, son,
00:06:57 does something happen here? Is there, is there anything you'd like to tell us?
00:07:00 And you can see him like, like tears are fucking leaking out of his eyes.
00:07:03 He's like clenching his fists and just screaming at the injustice of all.
00:07:06 He's like, nah nigga, I see shit.
00:07:11 It was fucking great. That, that non snitching rule is,
00:07:14 and then you see like in the background, as you say that to the cops,
00:07:16 they're just joyriding on the motorcycle being like,
00:07:18 yo, this bike is fucking dope dog.
00:07:21 Gonna smash this shit. Gonna fucking wreck that bike pussy.
00:07:24 Yeah, it was a great episode.
00:07:26 I wreck that bike pussy every single day of my life.
00:07:28 Mom curious to see if you guys agree with this sort of philosophy of the morality of secrets
00:07:34 in that if, if the secret you're holding makes your life worse by not confessing it,
00:07:40 do you have a right to confess it?
00:07:42 If it will improve the quality of your life by.
00:07:44 I mean, I guess if it comes down to like, if you break the promise,
00:07:49 what happens to your life?
00:07:50 Do people not trust you?
00:07:52 Or is it just the person that told you the secret doesn't trust you with knowledge?
00:07:57 Because like, you gotta, you gotta weigh the options of what will happen to you.
00:08:00 If your life will become so much better by confessing that it doesn't matter if people
00:08:05 think you might not be trustworthy, then of course.
00:08:09 Like I don't, I don't see the, I don't see the point in having a pride about being
00:08:13 trustworthy if your life is shit because of it.
00:08:16 Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.
00:08:17 That's what, that was Riley's problem, you know?
00:08:19 He, he fucked his life over by just being too committed to his ideology there.
00:08:23 I, yeah, I think that, I think that the two are kind of discreet factors,
00:08:28 but there's a context for everything and there's, there's a limit to how much you
00:08:30 should like hold any one position like that.
00:08:33 Like truth is really not always the best policy.
00:08:36 If, if your hoe ass look fat, she don't want to know her ass look fat, you know, you just.
00:08:41 Well, sometimes she does.
00:08:42 Well, sometimes.
00:08:44 Again, it depends on the context.
00:08:45 I don't think it's a secret that that hoe's ass looks fat.
00:08:48 I think she knows it anyway.
00:08:49 But, but here, here's the context.
00:08:50 Like if you're going out for a, for a night on the town with your lady and she says to you like,
00:08:55 do I look fat?
00:08:56 You say, no, you look beautiful.
00:08:57 You know, you can, you can say that shit and that's not, that's totally fine.
00:09:00 It's a white light.
00:09:01 If she is like in a fitness competition and she's been working and training and her ass
00:09:06 does legitimately look incredibly fat and she's totally unprepared for the competition
00:09:10 and she's like, okay, dude, does my ass look fat?
00:09:12 I need to know for this competition.
00:09:13 I don't want to get humiliated up there.
00:09:15 If you lie and plakie her and tell her like, no.
00:09:19 Exactly.
00:09:19 And then she, uh, well, in her ass does in fact look fat.
00:09:22 And like, like that's you sort of fucking her over through lying that way.
00:09:25 That's like, see, that's the two different ways to treat that particular example.
00:09:28 You know, yeah.
00:09:29 I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's wrong per se, you know, ever.
00:09:33 Well, okay.
00:09:34 Wrong.
00:09:35 Like it's not like against the law to fucking tell a secret.
00:09:38 I guess lying and secrets are two different things incidentally.
00:09:40 Yeah, I was going to say.
00:09:42 Yeah.
00:09:42 Well, yeah.
00:09:43 But, but, but, well, okay.
00:09:44 But they're kind of linked to you.
00:09:45 They're kind of the same thing.
00:09:46 So they're linked, they're linked.
00:09:47 Well, that there's, there's secrets that you keep the secrets that you keep for other people.
00:09:52 And then there are secrets that you just know and that are, you know, nobody confided in you.
00:09:58 You just know something and you don't know whether to tell anyone.
00:10:02 And when you do, they now have your secret, I guess.
00:10:06 We all have a secret.
00:10:07 It's like having the knowledge that you know that Osama bin Laden isn't the leader of the Taliban.
00:10:13 Like everyone wants to pretend that he is, but you don't want to tell the government because
00:10:16 you know that if they find out the truth that you are actually the leader of the Taliban,
00:10:19 they call that for you next.
00:10:21 It's a situation like that.
00:10:23 To that point about how I am the leader of ISIS, you know, it's like, it's, I do think that those
00:10:29 are two discrete factors to, to a monkey's point there.
00:10:31 Like if you decide that you want to like, you know, like, okay, for example,
00:10:35 like the common example people bring up for stuff like this is like you're a Catholic priest
00:10:39 and like a murderer confesses, you know, and then like, okay, so like this guy is a murderer.
00:10:44 And let's say he doesn't immediately plan to kill anybody else, but you never know.
00:10:48 You know, he's an unstable kind of guy.
00:10:49 He's like, I'm sorry, father.
00:10:51 I don't want to do it, et cetera, et cetera.
00:10:53 Like, first of all, I don't care about religion at all.
00:10:55 So I don't give a fuck about any of their like religious oaths.
00:10:57 But in terms of like the social standing there about how these guys like come here just to confess,
00:11:02 like frankly, the whole confession thing to me, I guess I'm going on a little bit of a tangent,
00:11:07 tangent, but like the confession thing is sort of a way that like these guys get to like ease
00:11:10 the burden of the sins that they've done.
00:11:12 And I don't want them to be eased of their burden.
00:11:15 I want them to be crushed under the weight of the crimes they've committed because they deserve it.
00:11:19 At least, I guess not every single time, but you know, with stuff like this.
00:11:23 But in any case, yeah, like if the priest decides that it's, he really needs to like
00:11:28 come forward, that like really does help the world.
00:11:31 It's like a good thing to do if you're like getting a guy like that off the streets.
00:11:34 But you are showing that you are willing to like break your oaths of secrecy and shit.
00:11:40 Just a negative consequence in other ways.
00:11:41 Do you think that there's a delicate balance between justice and secrecy?
00:11:47 Or do you think justice should always be more important than like keeping an oath?
00:11:52 You know, it's tough.
00:11:54 Since we live in the real world and not a fantasy world where you can like always expect
00:11:58 perfect justice all the time, I think sometimes it is appropriate to conceal things that might
00:12:05 help people if it would cause other problems, you know?
00:12:07 Like if you tell someone that like, fuck, I don't know, like if someone's got amnesia
00:12:12 and they used to be a murderer and like they now that like they had amnesia, they woke up,
00:12:17 they're in a new place and they're just like a new person and they're a really good person or
00:12:20 something.
00:12:21 Like does it make sense to then like sentence this person for the crimes that they committed before?
00:12:25 Like I know that's a crazy example, but that's the sort of idea I'm getting at.
00:12:28 But wouldn't it bring like peace to the families because now they know who killed their person
00:12:32 and like all that stuff?
00:12:34 That's true.
00:12:35 But again, like you're weighing a family's satisfaction at a man, you know, being locked
00:12:39 up versus like now there's a guy who, in this one example, who isn't causing any problems,
00:12:44 who you're going to lock up because of, you know, a situation that's basically been resolved on his
00:12:49 and no one else is going to be hurt.
00:12:50 And you know, it kind of comes down to the whole idea of like, what is the purpose of it?
00:12:52 You're assuming that there's going to be no like resurgence of memories where he's not going to
00:12:57 then go off and kill again.
00:12:59 Like it's very, like you know everything about the situation.
00:13:03 Yeah, by that same logic, like you just be some murder who didn't lose his memory,
00:13:07 but still decides, you know what?
00:13:08 I killed that one guy, I got it out of my system.
00:13:10 Now I'm just going to be an upstanding gentleman and like for the rest of his life he never does anything.
00:13:14 He goes to prison.
00:13:15 Well, hang on.
00:13:15 Okay, there's actually a cool example of this.
00:13:17 There was a guy recently who, fuck, what did he do?
00:13:20 I don't know.
00:13:21 He had done something and he was sentenced to like, I think like 20 years or something,
00:13:25 maybe less than that.
00:13:26 And when he was a kid he committed some crime, got sentenced, whatever.
00:13:28 And so like, so there's a thing when you get sentenced, if you're on bail, like
00:13:33 you get sent like a note to like bring yourself to jail, like report to jail now.
00:13:37 They don't fucking carry you off unless, you know, they like have you the whole time.
00:13:40 If you've been bailed out, you got to report yourself to jail.
00:13:43 Like this guy just didn't go and then nobody ever came for him because like paperwork got fucked up.
00:13:48 So then he spent like 40 years like constantly terrified that like someone was going to come
00:13:54 and nab him because he knew he had done this shit.
00:13:57 And he like started a family, did all this crazy shit.
00:13:59 And the thing is he really turned his life around and became a great guy.
00:14:02 So like did he pay the price of like, you know, committing the crime that he did legitimately
00:14:08 commit?
00:14:09 I mean, according to the law, no, but in the in the grander scheme of things,
00:14:13 the suffering that he went through of like living life on the edge all the time and being so afraid
00:14:17 of fucking anything up and getting his name like in the legal books in that way,
00:14:21 that's a punishment in of its own.
00:14:22 Talk about a secret, secret life and it's funny.
00:14:25 He didn't even tell like his wife and kids.
00:14:27 So like later on when they actually like the paperwork did get sorted and they came for him.
00:14:30 Oh God.
00:14:31 That was, he was like, honey, there's something I need to tell you.
00:14:36 Incidentally, in that case, they let the guy go because like it was such a clear case that he had
00:14:40 just, he had served his sentence basically by making himself a real nigga.
00:14:44 And what's worse, being in prison or having a family, I think he's paying for his crimes.
00:14:49 Yeah, you got a ball and chain on you either way.
00:14:52 Yeah, you're fucked.
00:14:57 Tom, tell me all your secrets.
00:15:01 I want the whole.
00:15:04 We got all night, baby.
00:15:07 I don't know.
00:15:08 I don't really, do I have any secrets if I do them?
00:15:11 So they're so innocuous.
00:15:13 Tom, tell me what they are.
00:15:14 Tell me this, Tom, you never liked my little pony.
00:15:16 You just did it for that Oculus Rift money.
00:15:19 Yeah, I actually have like seven Oculus Rifts.
00:15:21 I have one for every day of the week.
00:15:23 Oh my God.
00:15:23 Yeah, it's fucking great.
00:15:25 Fucking scum.
00:15:26 I even have an HTC Vive for the weekends.
00:15:29 It's fantastic.
00:15:30 I'm going, I'm a fucking ballin' over here now.
00:15:33 He played us.
00:15:33 Anybody had an experience where you shared a secret and that person was not trustworthy?
00:15:39 Yes.
00:15:39 Good question.
00:15:40 I don't know if I have much.
00:15:41 Muchy, what do you got buddy?
00:15:42 Yes, when I was in fifth grade, there was some sort of a school dance of some sort
00:15:47 where all the little babies would touch their flabby meat against one another
00:15:50 and would be a disgusting display for only the depraved and twisted to have any sort of,
00:15:58 you know, illicit reaction to.
00:16:00 Anyway, I went there with my friend, Rocky.
00:16:04 Rocky is like the source of my music for all of my fucking young life.
00:16:09 Whenever I hear the name Rocky, I instantly get like fucking like PDST.
00:16:14 Yeah, okay.
00:16:17 I just want to jump out a window so I can get away from the sound.
00:16:20 Anyway, I go there and I'm ordering, I'm ordering fucking Sprite and Skittles and I'm
00:16:25 fucking going, I'm going all out.
00:16:26 I'm fucking, I'm going on a bender, bro.
00:16:28 I'm gonna, I'm gonna fucking wake up in a ditch after I'm done at this place.
00:16:32 Anyway, so I just, I just fucking, I'm just walking with them and he's like,
00:16:35 fuck it, I love Wii Sports.
00:16:37 I'm like, dude, I know.
00:16:38 Anyway, here's the big secret.
00:16:40 Oh no, you spilled the beans.
00:16:42 No, no, then I forget what happens and, and, and, and I was just like, dude,
00:16:48 what if like girls weren't awful?
00:16:51 And he was like, dude, I'm going to go tell that girl right now that you, oh no.
00:16:56 And then I was like, what?
00:16:57 That doesn't make any sense.
00:16:58 And he went and did it.
00:17:00 And then I was just like, I don't know who you are.
00:17:02 And she was like, it's okay if you love me.
00:17:04 I understand.
00:17:04 I'm beautiful.
00:17:05 And I was just confused and scared.
00:17:07 And I ran to the bathroom because I hate women.
00:17:09 And I, and, and, and, and that fucking Chad was just going to fucking ruin my night.
00:17:14 And I couldn't finish eating my fucking, I accidentally dropped my fucking gummy worms
00:17:18 on the floor so I couldn't finish eating them because they were on the floor.
00:17:21 I just wanted to eat my gummy worms and spray.
00:17:23 I just wanted to eat what I came to the dance floor.
00:17:25 I wanted to eat the gummy worms.
00:17:27 Did you guys ever have, I think they're called like dirt cups or whatever.
00:17:30 They're chocolate pudding with Oreo crumble on the top.
00:17:33 And gummy worms in them.
00:17:35 Snow secret.
00:17:35 Those are the best things ever.
00:17:39 Slam dunk.
00:17:41 All of you.
00:17:41 All of you are beautiful.
00:17:43 F, all of you for the slam dunk, dude.
00:17:45 Yeah.
00:17:45 Okay.
00:17:46 Good.
00:17:46 Good.
00:17:47 Gib.
00:17:47 And I've forgipped him immediately because I had no other friends.
00:17:49 Oh, you did.
00:17:51 That's the way to do it.
00:17:52 Gib, tell me your secret.
00:17:54 Okay.
00:17:55 Gladly.
00:17:57 Actually, hang on.
00:17:58 I just got to take a bite of this, this burger.
00:18:00 It's been sitting here this whole time.
00:18:01 I'm really hungry.
00:18:01 Okay.
00:18:03 Now's your chance.
00:18:04 While your time to speak has come.
00:18:05 That's the perfect time to make a big fucking bite out of this burger, dude.
00:18:09 Okay.
00:18:09 Don't worry about us.
00:18:10 Okay, go.
00:18:11 Well, my secret is one slime of the worm and I broke them.
00:18:19 Keep it going.
00:18:20 And God, excuse me.
00:18:22 This is juicy.
00:18:24 And then I tried to eat the other one.
00:18:26 And it just didn't fit.
00:18:27 You buried the body there?
00:18:29 What the fuck?
00:18:30 Oh, no.
00:18:31 I'm sorry, hippo.
00:18:32 I can barely understand you.
00:18:33 All that anal juice in your mouth.
00:18:37 Oh, yeah.
00:18:38 Yeah.
00:18:39 But yeah, that's basically what happened.
00:18:39 I couldn't understand him because he has a stupid accent.
00:18:44 Look at down below.
00:18:46 Here comes the net.
00:18:47 A slammer come come come.
00:18:48 Go to the hero.
00:18:51 Yeah.
00:18:52 So yeah, that's my secret.
00:18:54 That was a bombshell.
00:18:55 I've got a story of the time a friend betrayed me and did not keep a secret.
00:18:59 Mm-hmm.
00:19:00 It was third grade.
00:19:01 I was eight years old.
00:19:03 I had this friend named Hunter and I lived out in the country.
00:19:06 So whenever I went to go stay the night at Hunter's house,
00:19:08 I could finally be out in the suburbs, baby.
00:19:11 We could raise some hell in a place where there's actually people.
00:19:15 And I'm not just alone in the middle of nowhere.
00:19:18 And Hunter has this checkbook of blank checks.
00:19:20 I don't know where he got it because he's eight.
00:19:22 But we thought, you know what would be funny as hell?
00:19:25 What if we filled out one of these checks for a million dollars?
00:19:29 And we went to our friend Will's house and we put it in his mailbox.
00:19:34 That would be the funniest thing of all time.
00:19:38 And thinking back, I don't know why we thought it would be funny.
00:19:41 I have no idea.
00:19:43 No idea.
00:19:44 So we do it.
00:19:45 And it's this big secret because we know,
00:19:47 we know for some reason that it's the biggest law in the world.
00:19:52 It's some big federal law that you're not allowed to touch anybody's mailbox
00:19:56 for any reason unless you're a mailman.
00:19:59 So we're like, oh man, what a big secret.
00:20:01 Oh man, we did this big prank.
00:20:03 We put a check in his mailbox.
00:20:04 We're going to get in so much trouble.
00:20:05 We're going to get arrested if they find out.
00:20:07 The next day at school.
00:20:09 The next day at school.
00:20:11 The special something teacher.
00:20:13 She's not like a special ed teacher,
00:20:14 but she's like a guidance kind of bitch.
00:20:17 I don't like it.
00:20:17 She's the type of feminist bitch where she hyphenates her last name.
00:20:21 So it's like her name, dash, husband's last name.
00:20:24 Disgusting.
00:20:25 I hate it.
00:20:25 Pick a side, you fucking horrors.
00:20:26 One or the other.
00:20:28 I don't care if you want to empower yourself and just keep your name.
00:20:31 That's fine.
00:20:31 I would prefer that.
00:20:32 I don't give a shit.
00:20:33 But to hyphenate, disgusting.
00:20:35 Fuck you.
00:20:37 This bitch shows up to the classroom that me and Hunter are in.
00:20:40 And she says, Jimmy, Jimmy, come here.
00:20:44 I'm like, uh-oh.
00:20:45 Uh-oh, that's not good.
00:20:46 They're going to interview us one at a time.
00:20:48 That's not good.
00:20:49 So she sits me down.
00:20:50 I'm alone in the room with her.
00:20:51 And she says, classic.
00:20:52 So did you and your friend Hunter do anything yesterday?
00:20:57 I'm like, no, no.
00:20:58 I don't know what you're talking about.
00:20:59 And she says, you know, I heard this rumor
00:21:02 that you might have put something in someone's mailbox.
00:21:05 Oh, no.
00:21:07 Red alert.
00:21:07 What are we going to do?
00:21:08 I got to make up some sort of crazy lie.
00:21:11 But at the same time, Hunter is also going to be interviewed.
00:21:14 And if he doesn't have the same crazy lie as me, then we're fucked.
00:21:19 That's the classic divide and conquer interrogation technique.
00:21:22 Absolutely.
00:21:23 So I say, oh, oh, that was just a joke.
00:21:25 We made up a joke that we did that.
00:21:27 We didn't actually do that.
00:21:28 It was just a joke.
00:21:29 And she says, oh, uh-huh.
00:21:30 OK, it was a joke.
00:21:32 So she takes me back to the classroom and says, hey, Hunter,
00:21:35 can you come with me?
00:21:37 In front of everybody, there's 20 other kids,
00:21:39 two teachers in the room.
00:21:40 And I say, hey, Hunter, yes.
00:21:41 She wants to ask us about that joke we told.
00:21:44 Remember that joke?
00:21:45 Well done.
00:21:45 Nice.
00:21:46 Yeah.
00:21:48 I thought I was super conspicuous about it.
00:21:50 Like, hey, you know that joke?
00:21:51 Go tell her about it.
00:21:52 About five minutes later, Hunter's back.
00:21:54 And she calls me out again.
00:21:55 Uh-oh.
00:21:57 Fuck.
00:21:58 And of course, she's more mad that I lied to her
00:22:01 than that we put something in someone's mailbox.
00:22:03 Because as it turns out, we're not in trouble for that.
00:22:05 So I don't know why she even called us out in the first place.
00:22:08 So that's the time Hunter betrayed me.
00:22:10 He couldn't keep the secret.
00:22:11 And he didn't know what a joke was.
00:22:13 Fuck you, Hunter.
00:22:14 I hope you burn in hell.
00:22:17 What a shitty teacher to just interrogate them
00:22:20 on the off chance that you can get in trouble from it.
00:22:23 Yeah.
00:22:23 Yeah.
00:22:24 I mean, what was her?
00:22:25 What was she actually interrogating you about?
00:22:27 Because like, she didn't know about, I mean,
00:22:29 the mailbox thing wasn't a problem.
00:22:30 I just want to see if these kids lie to me
00:22:32 so I can beat the shit out of them.
00:22:33 I don't know.
00:22:34 You didn't get in trouble for the mailbox stuff.
00:22:36 Like, I have no idea what the point of it was.
00:22:39 But it was over 15, about 15 years ago.
00:22:42 So maybe I'm missing a detail in my memory,
00:22:44 but I just remember that part.
00:22:46 Monkey, I want to know, in your school,
00:22:48 did every time a single person,
00:22:50 like, can you come to the office, please,
00:22:52 did the entire fucking room go, ooh?
00:22:55 Oh, of course.
00:22:55 And it was me every time.
00:22:56 I was going to go to his office every other month
00:22:59 in elementary school.
00:23:01 Calm down, Mark Simpson.
00:23:02 I remember one time, if we want to tell stories
00:23:05 about how we got in trouble in elementary school.
00:23:07 I definitely do.
00:23:08 The first time I got sent to the principal's office
00:23:10 was because when I was five, so this is like kindergarten,
00:23:14 recess is over, and we're all lining up to go back inside.
00:23:17 And I don't know what came over me.
00:23:19 But for some reason, there's this girl named Lauren,
00:23:21 who I kind of liked.
00:23:23 In front of everybody, I just fucking yell,
00:23:25 hey, Lauren, take off your pants.
00:23:31 And I have no idea what came over me,
00:23:33 why I would even say that.
00:23:34 I don't actually want to see this little girl with pants off.
00:23:35 You were just getting straight to the act.
00:23:37 You're getting down to business.
00:23:38 I guess so.
00:23:38 In your instance, yeah.
00:23:40 Next thing I know, I'm in the principal's office.
00:23:41 But luckily, this principal was the type of guy
00:23:43 who would say, so what'd you do?
00:23:45 And then you tell him what you did.
00:23:47 And then he laughs at your story
00:23:48 because you're a stupid kid doing stupid shit.
00:23:51 And then he says, don't do it again.
00:23:52 And then you go back to class.
00:23:53 So at least the principal was a cool guy.
00:23:55 That's good.
00:23:57 My elementary school woes are as long as fucking
00:24:01 scripture verses.
00:24:03 However, however, one that's somewhat related to this
00:24:08 is one time, again, with fucking,
00:24:12 what's his fucking ass, bitch ass name?
00:24:14 Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.
00:24:17 There was another friend I knew named Sean.
00:24:20 And he was like this fucking weird sort of like-
00:24:22 He was an audio engineer.
00:24:23 Yeah, he was an audio engineer.
00:24:25 He was like a fucking, he was like a super hall monitor.
00:24:28 Instead of like a hall monitor, he was a world monitor.
00:24:31 He monitored every action to every system.
00:24:35 And a hero.
00:24:36 Yeah, yeah.
00:24:37 So-
00:24:38 I'm picturing him as the all-seeing eye of Sauron.
00:24:40 Yeah, yeah.
00:24:40 About the hallways.
00:24:41 Yeah, okay.
00:24:41 Yeah, exactly.
00:24:42 But with the badge on.
00:24:44 And in a way to show off the badge.
00:24:45 Like, even when he was-
00:24:47 And even when we were in golf school,
00:24:48 he would just put his badge on over his fucking shirt,
00:24:50 just no matter what.
00:24:51 He'd just be like-
00:24:51 A world monitor.
00:24:53 And whenever I said-
00:24:54 And then whenever we got into a fight,
00:24:55 he would just say,
00:24:55 Dude, look at the badge, bro.
00:24:57 Look at the badge.
00:24:58 Look at the badge, dude.
00:24:59 Look at it.
00:24:59 Respect it.
00:25:00 Yeah, respect the badge.
00:25:01 Anyway, so Rocky just makes up this lie
00:25:04 that I've stolen his video game
00:25:06 because he's fucking Rocky.
00:25:07 Because he's fucking Rocky and get away with anyone
00:25:10 because his parents are divorced
00:25:11 and everyone has to be sorry for him
00:25:12 because his parents are divorced.
00:25:13 I don't care if his parents are divorced, Rocky.
00:25:15 I hate you.
00:25:18 Me too, dude.
00:25:20 Anyway, he makes up a lie
00:25:21 because he wants to get me back
00:25:23 because I think I like-
00:25:24 Because I beat him at Wii Sports
00:25:25 and he got super fucking pissed
00:25:26 after his controller.
00:25:27 And as we've established,
00:25:28 he loves Wii Sports.
00:25:29 Yeah, you look at-
00:25:30 He takes this kind of embarrassment, right?
00:25:33 In front of his whole family and clan.
00:25:35 He needs to redeem himself.
00:25:37 So he wants to fuck me over.
00:25:40 And so he gets Sean to interrogate me.
00:25:43 He's like-
00:25:44 And Sean comes over here and he takes me aside
00:25:46 and he's like, dude, I heard a rumor.
00:25:49 Is it true you're a thief?
00:25:51 Is it true that you've broken the law?
00:25:53 Those are some serious aspersions we've heard about.
00:25:56 Jesus Christ.
00:25:59 And I know I'm innocent,
00:26:00 so I just say, what do you think?
00:26:01 And I spit on his badge.
00:26:05 You spit on his badge?
00:26:08 Fuck your authority, world monitor.
00:26:11 And he's just like-
00:26:13 He's like, you're reckless,
00:26:15 but I believe you.
00:26:20 What the fuck?
00:26:22 Greatest turn of phrase.
00:26:24 Okay, all right.
00:26:26 That's what the policeman says
00:26:28 at the end of the thrilling action movie
00:26:30 where he's been intellectually dueling
00:26:32 with a goal-hearted criminal,
00:26:34 which is you in this case.
00:26:36 Fuck, what was it again?
00:26:37 What was the line?
00:26:38 You're reckless, but I believe you.
00:26:40 Yes.
00:26:41 The moment when respect was forged for a lifetime.
00:26:46 Brothers in arms.
00:26:48 And so what he does is,
00:26:49 me and Rocky are in the same class
00:26:50 and he's like been like eyeing me,
00:26:51 like fucking off,
00:26:52 fucking look at this fucking guy,
00:26:53 look at this fucking guy.
00:26:55 And then I walk back and I'm smiling,
00:26:57 I'm smiling wisely,
00:26:59 knowing that my superior errant life
00:27:00 has gotten me out of yet another jam.
00:27:03 And then Sean fucking like is like,
00:27:05 Rocky, we need to talk now.
00:27:08 And so Rocky starts losing his fucking shit
00:27:11 and is like scared that his life has been found out.
00:27:14 So he walks out and I hear,
00:27:16 like I don't know about this during the time,
00:27:18 but then like I meet up with Sean after school
00:27:20 and he just says, I told him,
00:27:22 I told him that I found out the truth
00:27:24 and that he can't hide the truth
00:27:26 from the world monitor himself.
00:27:29 Yeah, actually, by the way,
00:27:29 he called himself the world monitor, by the way.
00:27:31 That wasn't me making up.
00:27:32 He really did?
00:27:32 He called himself the world monitor.
00:27:34 Wow, you give a man a taste of power
00:27:36 and he wants to take it all.
00:27:38 He wants control of everything.
00:27:40 It's his better, his ill nature,
00:27:42 got a hold of him, his senses.
00:27:45 Anyway, so Rocky was shamed from the entire class
00:27:49 and Sean just said he was untrustworthy.
00:27:51 But after school, Rocky said,
00:27:53 I don't have anyone play Wii sports with me.
00:27:55 Can you please come over now?
00:27:56 I was like, okay, but I have to have a Smarties.
00:27:59 I have to have a Smarties.
00:28:00 I need to have one of your Smarties.
00:28:02 And he gave me one of their Smarties
00:28:03 and I played Wii sports and I beat him again.
00:28:04 He yelled at me and told me to leave the room.
00:28:09 It was a good time.
00:28:09 Wow, it was a good time.
00:28:10 What a journey.
00:28:11 Real quick here, also in middle school,
00:28:14 I was known for picking people up.
00:28:15 That was like what I did.
00:28:17 I was the person who picked people up
00:28:19 because I was just so massive and girthy
00:28:22 that I could do whatever I want.
00:28:24 And so I would pick people up.
00:28:26 And people like line up for like 10 people
00:28:28 would line up for me to pick them up
00:28:29 and just like set them back down.
00:28:32 I was the main attraction to the fucking playground.
00:28:35 Anyway, so this-
00:28:35 Maybe they actually just wanted a hug.
00:28:37 Yeah, maybe.
00:28:37 So this stupid ass fucking punk ass crippled motherfucker
00:28:41 rolls up in his fucking wheelchair and-
00:28:43 Ah, Jesus.
00:28:44 Always causing problems the goddamn disabled.
00:28:47 Fuck off.
00:28:47 A fucking apologizer, right?
00:28:49 Apologize already.
00:28:51 Anyway, so he's like, please, let me get a ride on arms.
00:28:58 I need to know it's like to feel young again.
00:29:03 And so I'm like, you know what?
00:29:06 I'll take pity on you fucking disabled, disabled man.
00:29:10 And so I lift him up and immediately he's like spying cracks.
00:29:13 Like he like-
00:29:14 Oh, Jesus.
00:29:15 He gets the wind taken out of him.
00:29:16 And so I set him down in his wheelchair
00:29:18 and I'm like, this is what you fucking get.
00:29:20 And then he rolls off to tell the fucking principle.
00:29:23 What the fuck?
00:29:24 Yeah.
00:29:25 Was this a kid or an actual old man?
00:29:27 No, this is like, you know, this is a child.
00:29:28 What's the difference between a child
00:29:30 who's that weak and an old man?
00:29:32 There is none.
00:29:33 They're basically the same thing.
00:29:33 Okay.
00:29:34 Anyway, so I get in trouble for him wanting me to pick him up
00:29:38 and providing that service for him.
00:29:40 There's no justice.
00:29:41 There's no justice.
00:29:42 I did what he wanted me to do and I got fucking-
00:29:45 Dude, and the worst thing is I would like-
00:29:47 He like went to tell the principle
00:29:49 when it was like end of lunchtime.
00:29:50 So I just went to class.
00:29:51 And then like I heard-
00:29:53 I was like some sort of like computer science class
00:29:56 or some of that effect.
00:29:56 And we were just in the computer lab.
00:29:58 And I heard people looking around me
00:30:00 and they're just like, did you hear so-and-so
00:30:01 who got the fucking Winby down?
00:30:03 Yeah, I heard someone fucking throw him down the ground.
00:30:05 Right.
00:30:05 I was like, no, it's not true!
00:30:07 Down on the ground, you fucking cripple!
00:30:13 It's not true.
00:30:14 I'm a good boy.
00:30:15 And then I went to the principal's office and he was-
00:30:16 And he-
00:30:17 And like I walked into his office
00:30:18 and he was like looking through the Venetian blinds.
00:30:21 Everything was dark and he was just like,
00:30:22 he was just like, menacing.
00:30:23 What did you do?
00:30:25 And I just like started-
00:30:26 I was like, I provided the service he wanted.
00:30:29 I provided the service he wanted.
00:30:30 I'm a good guy.
00:30:31 I'm a good vendor.
00:30:32 I'm a good host.
00:30:34 And then it was just like, it's not good enough.
00:30:36 And so he sent it to me to detention.
00:30:37 It was a scary time.
00:30:40 That was a big secret, guys.
00:30:42 It was a big secret.
00:30:43 Yeah, good secret.
00:30:45 Good secret.
00:30:46 When I think of secrets,
00:30:49 a lot of the times I think of gossip.
00:30:52 Because that's usually like-
00:30:53 It's never been said, hey, here's a secret.
00:30:56 Blah, blah, blah, this and that.
00:30:58 It's usually like, oh, I heard from one person,
00:31:01 a friend of a person, that they're going through this.
00:31:03 Did you hear this?
00:31:05 Yeah, you're not really supposed to bring it up
00:31:07 unless you want to be a gossipy person.
00:31:11 I don't know.
00:31:12 I don't really feel like I have any secrets
00:31:15 that I remember holding or getting given.
00:31:18 Because despite being the kid that never said anything
00:31:22 and was known for not doing any words out of my mouth,
00:31:25 like nobody thought, this guy I can confide in.
00:31:29 I guess nobody had anything to say, or at least not to me.
00:31:32 And I never had anything I cared to say to anyone else.
00:31:35 Because it's like-
00:31:36 Never under any circumstances.
00:31:38 Because a lot of the time, it's gossip.
00:31:41 It's like, why would you tell someone else about this thing?
00:31:45 Because you want to feel the rush of it going behind someone's back,
00:31:49 or I guess.
00:31:50 And I don't get that.
00:31:51 I don't feel that.
00:31:52 So I never had a secret.
00:31:54 I think gossiping gives people a sense of empowerment.
00:31:59 When they're sharing new information with someone,
00:32:00 that's a gift they get to give out.
00:32:02 And they get to watch the person give them credit
00:32:06 for being the one who shared that.
00:32:08 Something like that, anyway.
00:32:09 I would say I am the duality of man.
00:32:13 It personified.
00:32:15 If I do say so myself.
00:32:18 Dr. Munchy and Mr. Hat.
00:32:20 Yeah, exactly.
00:32:21 Uh, I like am gossipy, I think.
00:32:25 But if you tell me to not say something, then I will not.
00:32:27 Like, I get off on being loyal.
00:32:30 If someone's like, don't do this thing, I'll be like,
00:32:32 fuck you, I'm not going to fucking do that.
00:32:34 I'm going to fucking-
00:32:35 I'm going to take this to the fucking grave.
00:32:37 I'm going to fucking-
00:32:39 I'm like that.
00:32:40 But if it's like, did you hear that I have fucked a dog before?
00:32:44 What do you think about that, huh?
00:32:45 I'll be like-
00:32:47 Everyone's going to know about this guy fucking that dog.
00:32:48 Why did you tell Ben's secret?
00:32:52 He's like, I guess I'm gossipy like normal,
00:32:57 like a normal human level.
00:32:59 Like, if somebody is brought up in conversation
00:33:01 and it doesn't seem that bad to say,
00:33:02 hey, I heard that they eat shit, like, you know.
00:33:06 Not that bad.
00:33:07 Not that bad.
00:33:08 Like, they're well-known for eating shit.
00:33:10 I just thought, you know, you might like to know,
00:33:11 I want to be part of this conversation.
00:33:13 I got to say something.
00:33:14 But like, I don't know.
00:33:15 Like, I don't-
00:33:15 I'm just like discussing things and like,
00:33:19 I'm gossiping in the sense that like, if there's a problem,
00:33:21 if there's-
00:33:21 If like, someone's like working through a problem,
00:33:23 that's like not-
00:33:24 Like, it's not like a secret.
00:33:25 Like, I'm having a fucking clash in my soul.
00:33:28 If it's just like, yeah, I don't know how to fucking do this thing
00:33:31 with this guy, whatever, do-do-do-do-do-do.
00:33:33 Then I'll want to discuss that and like,
00:33:35 like with other people and like, come up with like,
00:33:37 I want to like, task force fucking like, police.
00:33:39 Like, how do I get this person to be happy?
00:33:41 Kind of like a-
00:33:43 Actually, wait, I figured out why I'm thinking.
00:33:46 I figured out why I can't think of any secrets.
00:33:49 It's because I don't think of them-
00:33:50 When I think of a secret,
00:33:51 I think of something you want to tell people.
00:33:53 And I don't care about anything that I'm told.
00:33:55 If somebody says something to me,
00:33:58 I won't ever say it to anyone else, really.
00:34:00 And if they expressly say, please don't tell anyone,
00:34:04 I'll be like, yeah, yeah, of course.
00:34:05 And it won't even feel like a secret.
00:34:07 It won't feel like I'm-
00:34:08 It's just waiting to be unleashed on people.
00:34:11 Like, it's not even part of my brain anymore.
00:34:13 It's just sort of like, oh yeah, I guess I know that.
00:34:16 I get it.
00:34:17 Calling something a secret can kind of
00:34:19 give it a red flag in your memory
00:34:21 and it'll make you kind of want to talk about it.
00:34:23 So yeah, sometimes you're better off.
00:34:24 It'll make you want to secrete it from your anus.
00:34:27 Hippo, we're trying to eat over here.
00:34:30 Let's discuss in brief.
00:34:33 So this has been coming up a couple of times.
00:34:35 So like, are we all in agreement that honesty is not always the best policy?
00:34:41 Does anyone feel differently from that?
00:34:42 I would say it's usually the best,
00:34:44 but there are times when you lie and it is just better.
00:34:47 All this has to do with deals and absolutes.
00:34:50 I like being honest and being known as someone who just-
00:34:55 Like, if I say something, I want people to know that that's what I mean.
00:34:59 Unless I'm obviously doing it in a silly voice and it's a joke.
00:35:03 But like, I hate people who hope that you understand something from-
00:35:11 like, you know, they want you to get it without them saying it.
00:35:16 I would rather just be a person who says it.
00:35:19 You're talking about women.
00:35:19 You're talking about women, right?
00:35:23 That's my secret.
00:35:24 I'm gay.
00:35:24 In fairness, men do it too.
00:35:26 Oh yeah, yeah, of course.
00:35:27 It's not really a secret after the fetish episode.
00:35:33 I want to know what you think.
00:35:35 I also like being like honestly known as like,
00:35:38 if I say this, then it's like real.
00:35:42 I do like having to not specify this isn't a joke, by the way.
00:35:45 This is a real thing that I truly do believe.
00:35:48 But I never believe anything anyone says to me, almost ever.
00:35:54 I always have to be like, really?
00:35:57 Is that really?
00:35:58 And then like five more rounds and I'll be like,
00:36:02 maybe I believe you, possibly.
00:36:04 So basically, you'll believe things the more times that they're insisted upon
00:36:07 by the person as long as they don't change the story or crack
00:36:11 under the psychological pressure of your interrogation.
00:36:13 I like to believe that everyone is real and that everything they say is completely true
00:36:19 unless otherwise specified because especially on the internet,
00:36:23 thinking any other way is confusing and time consuming.
00:36:25 Just think about like, oh, are they real?
00:36:28 Are they saying that for real?
00:36:29 No, they're completely true because they haven't said,
00:36:32 by the way, I'm lying yet.
00:36:34 I think you have to take the opposite approach online.
00:36:36 I think you should assume everybody is lying until proven honest.
00:36:41 I basically agree with that.
00:36:42 It's funnier if I just think everyone's real.
00:36:45 Well, even not just online, but in all aspects of life,
00:36:49 I was going to say that I don't think there's a single person in the world.
00:36:52 I mean, it depends what you mean by truth.
00:36:53 But I think that everyone is constantly wearing different masks
00:36:58 and they're presenting themselves differently to different people.
00:37:01 And that doesn't, in a situation like here, recording the PCP,
00:37:04 I behave a certain way.
00:37:05 And then in a different situation, I might act differently
00:37:09 if I'm with a different crowd or like when I'm at work.
00:37:11 You know, when I'm at work, that's me.
00:37:12 Is it me keeping a secret that I don't present myself at work
00:37:16 the same way I do on here?
00:37:17 I don't think so.
00:37:20 I think everybody knows you have to have a professional attitude when you're at work.
00:37:23 I don't think you've, and everybody you know at work,
00:37:25 that's not really them.
00:37:26 That's like them putting on their serious face, you know?
00:37:29 Sure.
00:37:30 And I don't know, I don't really think there's a moral issue with most secrets,
00:37:33 unless there's, you know, some important thing attached to them.
00:37:35 If we're talking about like masks and shit,
00:37:37 I feel like the masks you wear the most often is the true you,
00:37:42 but it doesn't really matter too much whether you're true all the time.
00:37:46 I don't think that's the true you, but okay.
00:37:48 Well, like all of the different masks are you,
00:37:51 but like you can only see a couple of them at a time.
00:37:54 If you want to say as a matter of convenience,
00:37:57 like when you like go, okay, so when you're at work, you're like doing a job,
00:38:00 you're interacting with people, that's you acting a certain way.
00:38:03 Then when you like, when you get out and you go home and you're just like chilling,
00:38:06 like maybe that's the true you.
00:38:08 But here's the, here's a question though.
00:38:10 If you spend like, let's just say your job is incredibly intense,
00:38:13 and you spend 16 hours a day at work with your game face on,
00:38:17 and then you only spend eight hours a day at home,
00:38:19 does that mean the true you is now the work you,
00:38:22 based on the time, the percentage that's been?
00:38:24 I don't know, I just threw that idea out there.
00:38:26 Is it your resting position?
00:38:27 Maybe it's your resting position.
00:38:28 I think it's the true you.
00:38:30 If you have to, if you're at any point,
00:38:32 if you're filtering your thought and actions through like what you believe
00:38:37 is socially acceptable in that situation,
00:38:39 I don't think that's your true self.
00:38:40 Your true self is when like, I'm just going to do what I want,
00:38:43 and I'm not worried about consequences or judgments.
00:38:45 That's who you really are.
00:38:46 Yeah, but then everybody would be a rapist.
00:38:49 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:38:50 Like, but the fact that I have never,
00:38:53 well, okay, that's not going to be personally,
00:38:55 but like people.
00:38:57 Yeah, it's not a secret podcast.
00:38:59 It is, that's true.
00:39:00 We all, I mean, you know, we've all had a desire to like,
00:39:03 ooh, that's a nice piece of candy.
00:39:04 It'd be sure nice to pocket that and just walk out.
00:39:06 I'm not going to pay $10 for this fucking lollipop or whatever.
00:39:10 Yeah, you know, we all do converges.
00:39:11 If you're charging $10, you have a moral obligation to steal that candy.
00:39:15 Yeah, that's true, that's true.
00:39:17 Okay, okay.
00:39:18 I would describe your quote unquote true stuff like this.
00:39:21 Imagine a nice roll or ball of slime and gel,
00:39:25 and sort of, you know, delicious meat kiss.
00:39:26 Don't gotta tell me twice.
00:39:28 I have mine here before me, yes.
00:39:29 Yeah, yeah.
00:39:31 Would it be green?
00:39:33 It can be whatever, whatever color you think most represents your soul.
00:39:37 So in your case, it would be a putrid yellow.
00:39:43 Possibly have a blood clots in it.
00:39:46 And since.
00:39:47 Oh, no.
00:39:48 How am I eating here?
00:39:52 Anyway, okay.
00:39:53 So you have that like nice, that nice slime layer.
00:39:56 Then you get like like on for every context,
00:39:58 it's like a new like cheese grater you have.
00:40:00 It has different sized holes and like the shape of the holes are different.
00:40:03 Sometimes they're really big holes, so a lot of slime gets through.
00:40:05 And sometimes like only a little bit of slime gets through.
00:40:08 And then when you grate that slime to like residue that comes out,
00:40:11 the slime that gets out of it is like the bits of you
00:40:14 that are still within your mask.
00:40:15 But the like the mask is the cheese grater.
00:40:18 You know what I'm saying?
00:40:19 It's always going to be parts of you.
00:40:21 It just depends on each context, how much comes out of you.
00:40:23 But it all is still you.
00:40:25 Oh, so so so wait.
00:40:27 So wait, what if what if mind meld technology was created and you could you could you could you could
00:40:34 blow your brains together like digitally and like go into each other's consciousnessness.
00:40:39 And then you'll be like, I know this guy perfectly truthfully.
00:40:43 And then you come out and then you're like, hey, I get it now.
00:40:47 I get you and he gets you too.
00:40:50 Would that would that be like knowing the true self?
00:40:53 Is that what it means to be gay?
00:40:54 To have a soul mate?
00:40:59 Yeah, something like that.
00:41:00 That would be like literally like fucking the slime, bro.
00:41:03 You get right up in that shit, dude.
00:41:05 Straight up.
00:41:06 I would just like to say that YouTuber,
00:41:08 monkey jones has definitely never worn a mask.
00:41:12 That's ever.
00:41:13 Never ever.
00:41:15 I mean, I mean, he's taken it off so far.
00:41:16 It's like so long ago that the pain doesn't even really get to him anymore.
00:41:20 No.
00:41:20 Yeah, it's not even painful at all.
00:41:23 Pain without love.
00:41:24 Pain can't get enough.
00:41:25 Pain.
00:41:26 Exactly.
00:41:26 But I like it rough.
00:41:28 And I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all.
00:41:30 You know, it's interesting that that's my seat.
00:41:35 That's, I don't know, that self-censorship kind of thing.
00:41:40 It's not really self-censorship, I guess.
00:41:41 It's just the stuff, like the fact that I'm not saying all kinds of like racial
00:41:45 expletives, you know, I could if I wanted to.
00:41:48 Naked.
00:41:48 I could say, yeah, there you go.
00:41:50 There you go.
00:41:53 Naked.
00:41:53 What you're trying to say is you're a secret racist.
00:41:55 We get it.
00:41:56 It's fine.
00:41:56 That's how I like it.
00:41:57 Nate, Charlie's Fills.
00:41:58 Charlie's not there.
00:41:59 Charlie's not there.
00:42:01 What's up, kid?
00:42:02 And Hillary's not actually there.
00:42:03 It's just cardboard.
00:42:04 Don't worry.
00:42:05 What?
00:42:06 That's not true.
00:42:07 I don't know what you mean.
00:42:08 I'm here.
00:42:09 I'm here, folks.
00:42:10 I just want to announce me and my betrothal to a big fairy tale fan,
00:42:15 creator of Minecraft, founder of every website in the world, especially neopets.com.
00:42:22 Hillary Clinton is here.
00:42:24 I love her.
00:42:24 And here she is with a quick message to everyone.
00:42:27 Hello, everyone.
00:42:28 My name is Hillary Clinton.
00:42:29 Is that Jeff Foo?
00:42:30 I love you.
00:42:32 Yeah.
00:42:32 All right.
00:42:33 That's it.
00:42:33 She's gone.
00:42:33 She's gone.
00:42:34 Not 50 points ahead.
00:42:37 I don't get it.
00:42:38 Dude, did you guys hear that she just came out with a book and audio book
00:42:41 narrated by herself called What Happened?
00:42:43 And it's about the election?
00:42:45 I do actually want to read that.
00:42:46 Was that?
00:42:47 I've listed that audio book.
00:42:48 Is there a question mark at the end of that title?
00:42:51 Is she asking the question, what happened?
00:42:53 Is it saying, oh, this is what?
00:42:55 Is it a declaration or a question?
00:42:56 I don't know.
00:42:57 We'll have to look into that.
00:42:58 A question would be hilarious.
00:42:59 Hillary doesn't have questions, only answers.
00:43:01 I have to assume that she's acknowledging all of the reasons why she lost,
00:43:05 because a lot of it was on her back.
00:43:07 I mean, if she's just blaming Trump the whole time, then that's not an honest answer.
00:43:10 You're just going to open up the book.
00:43:12 There's going to be tons of blank pages.
00:43:14 You're going to halfway through, and then in big fucking letters,
00:43:16 take out the whole page, patriarchy.
00:43:18 And that's it.
00:43:19 What's happening?
00:43:20 Oh, yeah.
00:43:21 I mean, honestly, I think there's no way that this person will not, like,
00:43:25 she's definitely going to dive into all the excuses.
00:43:30 Like, what's her goal?
00:43:31 It's her goal to be like, you know what?
00:43:32 It's time to do some self-discovery.
00:43:33 You know what?
00:43:34 It's time to look inside.
00:43:34 That's what I would hope for.
00:43:36 That's what I would hope for.
00:43:36 But I hope that the book, like, chapter one should be called I'm Unlikable,
00:43:40 but it's going to be called Patriarchy.
00:43:41 Yeah.
00:43:42 If she's trying to preserve political capital,
00:43:45 then she's going to be the dishonest, you know, continue to say that.
00:43:48 In my head, for some reason, it is a bright pink with fluffy pink fluff on the outside
00:43:55 and a little pen.
00:43:56 And it's just a diary, but with Hillary's face on every page.
00:44:01 And you can write it.
00:44:03 And you decide what happened.
00:44:06 It's in the Diary of the Wimpy Kid format, but with Hillary instead of fucking Greg.
00:44:11 Yeah.
00:44:12 Dude, that should be your next thing, monkey.
00:44:15 Yeah.
00:44:15 I'll do a Diary of a Losing Candidate.
00:44:19 Well, I mean, okay, okay.
00:44:20 It's not even fair to say that, you know, you know, Hillary was serious.
00:44:24 Well, because everyone just loved Jill Stein so much.
00:44:26 How was she not supposed to be like it?
00:44:28 You know, she was just overwhelming.
00:44:30 Yeah, yeah.
00:44:31 I believe I tried to vote for Jill Stein and failed in doing so.
00:44:35 And so I believe that that was my attempt.
00:44:38 Should we move on to questions, folks?
00:44:39 Let's let's do it.
00:44:40 Let's do it.
00:44:41 Yeah.
00:44:41 That was a fun aside.
00:44:42 Yeah.
00:44:43 Oh, it's Jeb Bush.
00:44:44 If anyone doesn't share their comments, feel free to.
00:44:45 It's Jeb Bush, the guy I was thinking of.
00:44:47 I was thinking Jeff Thu every time.
00:44:50 Every time.
00:44:52 Same.
00:44:53 His name is Jeb Bush.
00:44:54 But his name is Jeb Bush.
00:44:55 Not the son of Jeb.
00:44:56 I thought they were like completely different.
00:44:57 Oh, no.
00:44:58 So no one should make like the chart where it's all fucking yellow and Jeb is like doing a power pose
00:45:03 when they have that with Jeff and the PCP subscribers or something like that.
00:45:07 That's a good idea.
00:45:09 Okay.
00:45:10 Oh, I love Jeff.
00:45:12 Just note here.
00:45:13 Tell me all of your secrets, guys.
00:45:15 Come PM me.
00:45:16 Tell me how many people you've touched in such a way.
00:45:20 As Jeb touched the nation during the 2016 election.
00:45:23 Yeah.
00:45:24 Yeah.
00:45:25 Good idea.
00:45:27 Okay.
00:45:27 Let's see.
00:45:27 I'm going to Twitter to get some questions.
00:45:30 And we've also got some, I think.
00:45:31 I shall get some from the data.
00:45:33 Wait, wait.
00:45:33 Before I do questions, I have a secret.
00:45:37 One time, I touched a girl's hand and I was like,
00:45:39 No!
00:45:41 I touched it.
00:45:42 I was, it was a prolonged exposure.
00:45:44 No!
00:45:45 Did you ask permission first?
00:45:47 Because I'm afraid I've got some boys in blue who are going to need a report to your domicile.
00:45:51 She grabbed my hand.
00:45:52 She was, she raped you then.
00:45:54 She didn't guess for consent.
00:45:56 All right.
00:45:56 Well, she's in jail now.
00:45:58 Don't worry about it.
00:46:00 Okay.
00:46:00 Jess has been sent.
00:46:01 That monster is locked up.
00:46:03 That woman's name was Hillary Clinton.
00:46:04 That's why she wasn't available for, yeah.
00:46:08 It's my fault Trump won.
00:46:11 Well done.
00:46:13 Mozilla Fiddick can ask, what is the most powerful bug in all caps?
00:46:17 Sizer.
00:46:18 Scissor.
00:46:18 Whatever you want to call it.
00:46:19 A beetle possibly?
00:46:20 Maybe.
00:46:22 Scissor could just vour a pincer.
00:46:24 Oh, oh, guys.
00:46:25 He would just use aerial ace and win.
00:46:27 Exactly.
00:46:28 Recently, I was in France.
00:46:29 And in France, they have hornets.
00:46:31 There was these hornets.
00:46:32 No!
00:46:32 And they, yeah.
00:46:34 But it's, it's weird.
00:46:35 They're sort of like bigger wasps with long, thick thighs, right?
00:46:40 That just dangle down next to them.
00:46:42 But they're so stupid.
00:46:43 They just hit walls and can't stand on anything.
00:46:47 They're actually adorable.
00:46:48 I love, I love hornets.
00:46:49 What I would say to a scary hornet is like, dude,
00:46:53 Beedrill isn't even competitive.
00:46:55 You've got to get the fuck.
00:46:56 I'm not intimidated by you.
00:46:57 He has like one speed.
00:46:59 Have you seen Megabedrill though?
00:47:01 He's like the coolest motherfucker in all of them.
00:47:03 He looks retarded.
00:47:04 Megas are bad.
00:47:05 Megas are bad all of them are horrible.
00:47:07 Beedrill is Gurren Lagoon.
00:47:10 Oh, Jesus Christ.
00:47:12 The closest to Gurren Lagoon is without a doubt.
00:47:15 Scissor.
00:47:15 And I like scissor years before I even saw fucking Gurren Lagoon.
00:47:18 Okay, well whatever.
00:47:19 Uh, here we go.
00:47:21 Question.
00:47:21 I got one at Jade Moreau, our old friend.
00:47:24 What are y'all's opinion on love songs?
00:47:27 Gay.
00:47:28 Love songs.
00:47:29 My favorite one is the George Harrison something.
00:47:34 Something in the way she moves.
00:47:35 That's a good love song.
00:47:37 The rest are bad.
00:47:38 The rest are bad.
00:47:39 If I remember correctly, shit, who was it?
00:47:41 Not only is that song, uh, great.
00:47:43 I believe it was-
00:47:44 Charlie Ray Jebson with Call Me Maybe.
00:47:46 Great love song.
00:47:48 Some, some world famous-
00:47:49 I actually do like that song.
00:47:51 Some famous love song singer who I can't fucking remember.
00:47:53 Oh no, I love song.
00:47:55 I love songs, that is.
00:47:57 Wake me up when September ends.
00:48:01 That's the, the guy from Green Day wrote that
00:48:03 because his dad, I was really hot in the-
00:48:05 Yeah, that's not a love song.
00:48:06 It's like about some guy who died.
00:48:08 Not about his dad.
00:48:10 It's about daddy.
00:48:10 Wake me up inside.
00:48:12 Wake me up.
00:48:13 Can't wake up inside.
00:48:15 Say Jesus.
00:48:18 Wake me up when pedophilia is legal.
00:48:25 And also incest.
00:48:26 I love my dad.
00:48:29 Uh, he's a question, he's a question.
00:48:31 He never thought of the song.
00:48:34 It was, it was, I was just gonna, I can't,
00:48:36 I can't think of a good song,
00:48:37 but it was, I was gonna say about, uh, Gibbs.
00:48:40 Some famous love song singer said that George Harrison's song,
00:48:43 something of the way she moves,
00:48:44 was the best love song I've ever written.
00:48:45 Oh, Frank Sinatra?
00:48:46 I think it was Frank Sinatra.
00:48:48 What's new pussycat?
00:48:49 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
00:48:53 That's the greatest love song of all time.
00:48:54 What's new pussycat?
00:48:55 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
00:48:58 Reg's girlfriend in the PCP patient lounge asks,
00:49:01 how do you be productive?
00:49:03 Stop being a bitch and fucking do it already.
00:49:06 Jesus Christ. Yeah, yeah, you gotta you gotta remove obstacles from your life. I have I have I have I have a video
00:49:14 Watched by died. I watched by me about Van Harman
00:49:19 Who was talking about this a very thing? How do you be productive out here?
00:49:23 He said that the whole idea of like having deadlines and forcing yourself to do it is okay
00:49:29 It gets the job done, but it's not good for growing yourself at being able to do stuff
00:49:34 so the the whole it's better to
00:49:37 Not force deadlines upon yourself
00:49:39 But to just not take anything you do as seriously as you take it and just make shit and make it bad and go and go into it
00:49:47 Wanting it like making sure that it's shit because otherwise nothing gets made and that's that's how you do it
00:49:54 Apparently that I like that a few episodes of the latest season of Rick and Morty. Oh
00:50:01 I don't know
00:50:05 Okay, here's a question at the Vajita asks hey, that's a just joke. He stole that that's that's true
00:50:12 There's underscores here. What part of your everyday routine is the worst?
00:50:17 What part of your routine is the worst for me without a doubt it's waking up waking up is by far the worst part of my day
00:50:25 I
00:50:29 Hate getting out I said I said literally ten alarms for myself every morning cuz I cannot no no no
00:50:34 No, I mean, I mean, I know you have a job so you have to but I would have I would advise against
00:50:41 Alarms because I've never had I've got rid of alarms and I've learned to just wake up at the right time
00:50:46 It's way better. I feel so much better. I wish I could do that
00:50:50 I can't trust myself though. If I if I could like guarantee that I went to bed by a certain time
00:50:54 I'd try that but yeah, I'm just abusing my body every day that I like
00:51:00 It's not good for you, it's not it's the most it's the most terrible way to begin getting up when I am
00:51:06 By a loud noise when I'm free for my fucking wage slave job patreon.com slash best guy ever everybody
00:51:12 Let's hit that $5,000 per month market. I'll be fucking free today. I
00:51:17 I
00:51:18 Yeah, I'm hurting myself
00:51:20 I will wake up at any time I want it'll be great
00:51:23 Alarms are cool because then you can set your own custom alarm clock sound and then you can like go to your friend at the bar
00:51:29 You can be like, what's your alarm sound and you just say my dad screaming at me?
00:51:34 Look at my scars
00:51:39 Also alarms make you hate whatever the alarm is I have PTSD for the default alarm sound from my phone
00:51:45 If I ever hear it again, I will get so upset that I might shit myself
00:51:51 Are you ever walking around and then you hear someone's phone rings and it's the noise that you use as your alarm?
00:51:56 Yeah, oh my god, it's gonna. I'm gonna die. Just thinking about
00:52:01 Obliterated
00:52:01 That's that's like that's what's like for me
00:52:03 But even worse because my alarm clock sound is a is a song from Homestuck. So whenever I'm listening to
00:52:08 ography I just get that sound I just fucking oh
00:52:11 No, no, no, no, okay
00:52:12 So you're making a big mistake. You never put a song you actually like as your alarm sound. That's that's you can't do it
00:52:17 It's not legal can't be done. You know, it's all about
00:52:21 Cosmetic and duality and your whole
00:52:26 Right, you know, I used to do that
00:52:28 I used to use anime songs as my alarm clocks, but then I start to dislike anime and I'm like I can't go down this road
00:52:33 I can't this is too much of a risk
00:52:35 I'll die. I'll lose all all identity if I keep this up
00:52:39 Milady from the PCP patreon Lana asked would you rather know the date of your death or the cause of your death?
00:52:45 You have to pick one. This assumes that I will die in my life. I would
00:52:50 That's true, I would much rather know the cause than the day I do not want to know the date that fucks you up in all kinds of ways
00:52:57 Yeah, cause could cause could happen. I know the cause I can train and be ready
00:53:03 Well, assuming that it's it's always
00:53:08 I've been ready to die for years
00:53:10 Yeah, but like if you if you hear like the cause of your death is a train crash
00:53:15 And you're like, okay, I'm never gonna go on a train again
00:53:18 And then then it's obviously because a train crashes into you like what you you can't avoid it
00:53:23 But if you do any planning, it's gonna be in vain
00:53:30 Because like yeah, you just be like scared of knives for the rest of your life or whatever
00:53:34 But if I know the date I know like okay, well, I have 80 years now to get all these projects done
00:53:38 I guess I better start doing them. Well, you know, that that that length of term
00:53:43 I mean, what if you find out it's in let's just say like five years like how are you gonna choose to spend five years?
00:53:48 You know, that's that's a time you're gonna you're gonna panic, but you're gonna get a lot of stuff done
00:53:52 Yeah, which could be good if it turns out that the guy who was telling you that you're gonna die is just a crazy man
00:53:58 Yeah, that's yeah, that's I know I have five years
00:54:02 Cuz like either way you're gonna die in five years, so at least I can spend those five years being productive rather than
00:54:11 Because you think about it, I mean none of us are gonna be alive in
00:54:22 Download myself to the vapor net
00:54:27 I agree actually I actually
00:54:32 Is gonna is not it's gonna it's gonna be it's gonna it's gonna be a gonna be a good robot
00:54:40 I I don't think that consciousness is real
00:54:42 And I think we're basically seeing like individual frames
00:54:45 String together like a film that's constantly playing so it gives us the illusion of a sense of self
00:54:50 In a sense of like continuity to our consciousness. That is a moment to moment. This is too stupid. Can we go to the next question?
00:54:56 The least stupid thing I have the dumbest thing I've ever heard you say dude, dude
00:55:00 I have a tangent
00:55:02 tangentially related to
00:55:05 What you were saying?
00:55:06 That's just thinking I was thinking earlier in the week about like robots being like the literal
00:55:14 The the the the next evolution of humans not humans with robotic parts, but like literally just robots
00:55:20 We make them and they live much longer than we can so they're literally our children
00:55:25 They're gonna last longer than they're gonna be able to go and do whatever, but they're not going to be like us
00:55:31 Preserved they're just gonna be new people
00:55:34 I want to build I want to build a robot daughter and I'm gonna call her risk and she's gonna be
00:55:38 Unbeatable and she's gonna live forever in the universe and it's gonna be like yeah
00:55:44 I should do an episode on transhumanism. That's a great idea. It's a great and there be robot. Penethilia
00:55:51 Okay, it depends it depends what you mean
00:55:54 You got to find your terms because like can a man look at a baby looking robot with lust in his heart and be called a pedophile
00:56:00 I say yes, can a baby robot in fact be the victim of a pedophilic sexual act?
00:56:06 I say no so that's you know
00:56:09 Cuz then they could
00:56:11 After wait 18 years to fuck it. I say that's bullshit exactly if you if you got a robot
00:56:16 You could just turn that crank to to make the whole whatever size you want
00:56:20 Doesn't even matter. I've imagined like an old steampunk like a big old crank. You got a like
00:56:26 Over the vagina
00:56:27 I'm gonna make that hole as big as a cave so I can walk inside and I can learn where babies come from finally that makes sense
00:56:33 That makes sense. Oh, by the way, what's the name of that? What's the name of that ship? Okay? Well, okay, just a
00:56:40 There's a there's a name a sycophant. No, that's not it
00:56:43 Okay, so like if you if you take a ship and it's out sailing and it gets damaged and you repair a piece and you keep doing that
00:56:50 Keep going and eventually every single piece has been replaced by something. So it is in fact
00:56:56 Well, okay, so it's like it's still called like the same thing as it what it was there's a name for this but I forget what it is
00:57:02 It's not is this a fist is like the hill that the guy puts the rock up, you know
00:57:05 That's the sycophane thing or whatever. It's got some other name that I can't remember
00:57:09 But the point I'm getting at is like it is theoretically possible that a human being can in fact just become a robot in a sense
00:57:16 If like let's say that you take your brain and you replace one piece of it with an artificial piece and then you okay
00:57:21 you live already you're dead and
00:57:23 Why so well that's the question like at what point do you become a robot?
00:57:27 And if there is no clear point where it happens, I think you could maybe replace every single piece and just then be a robot
00:57:33 Oh, you know what you know what I'm gonna do. What's that? I'm gonna become a robot that is just has a human penis
00:57:38 You're real human real penis. I'll be like oh, it's a real human penis. Whoa real
00:57:47 That's just doesn't happen anymore
00:57:51 And my future robot self will have so much fun
00:58:01 Oh Christ
00:58:03 Okay, any other cookies
00:58:08 I
00:58:18 Yeah, who knows man, I don't know something in some way. I think okay. No, it wasn't let's move on. Yes, okay
00:58:25 Yeah, here's one at Lord Saiba says if you were with Digi what unspeakable acts would you do in his big-ass room?
00:58:32 I take a shit
00:58:35 That's what I would do
00:58:40 Yeah, of course I did yeah, yeah, yeah, it was great
00:58:42 It was great on his house. Yeah, you know that's awesome
00:58:46 And then we pissed on him and then we pissed on his brothers, and it was great. Yeah, you know, don't you dare?
00:58:55 Yeah, I love Vincent. He's my favorite
00:58:58 Bro, it's okay, monkey. He had an umbrella. Oh, thank goodness
00:59:03 I don't know how you got taller than Victor, but good job. He's a powerful stream. It can arc quite
00:59:10 That's his secret power. It's his cutie mark. We introduce Victor to challenge pissing where if you
00:59:16 Piss six feet straight with the air and not get wet you get no dumb payment in your next car visit
00:59:28 Hell
00:59:32 All right, there's no more good questions on the on the Twitter
00:59:35 Is there anything left in the incredible question? Okay?
