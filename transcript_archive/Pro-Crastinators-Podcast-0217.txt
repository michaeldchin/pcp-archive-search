00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're the reason people are dying
00:00:09 and you're the reason that we exist. No, that's not true.
00:00:14 It skits true. No, it's true.
00:00:16 It's sort of true. It's entirely true.
00:00:18 I'll give it to them. They can take credit for everything we've done.
00:00:24 How's everyone's week been? Another week of no fucking videos on the channel.
00:00:31 Thanks, YouTube. Love you.
00:00:33 Thanks, YouTube.
00:00:34 My favorite, the best. I'm so glad we tethered our existence to this hellscape.
00:00:40 They just keep saying, yeah, we'll work on it. And then, I don't know.
00:00:47 Yeah, for the time being, these are all going to be audio only, but when I hope the channel
00:00:54 is cleansed of stupid shit and we can post things safely again, they'll all come out
00:01:01 at once. Most people will be like, okay, I'll skip them.
00:01:04 Yeah. Most people who end up hearing this will hear it weeks later. Assuming they come
00:01:12 out at all. Assuming that the channel doesn't just get obliterated again.
00:01:16 And we just never return to YouTube. We just spur them for life and like, fuck you.
00:01:22 Why don't we just go full paywall? We don't need to go full paywall. We can have it free
00:01:29 on a website like every other podcast. I know we don't have to go full paywall.
00:01:35 I'm just saying, why not? You know?
00:01:40 You know, when you say it, I suddenly agree. As long as you say it.
00:01:45 Yeah, I did.
00:01:46 I don't know about paywalls, but I do like the word pay. So I'll sign off on it just
00:01:53 for that reason.
00:01:54 That's my logic as well.
00:01:56 Okay, cool.
00:01:59 I want to start off with a follow-up to what I was saying last time about suicide because
00:02:06 I had more ideas.
00:02:08 I've missed the juicy one.
00:02:09 More ideas about how to kill yourself?
00:02:11 No, no, no, no, no. It was about what I said about the idea of guilt, of inconveniencing
00:02:22 other people being the reason you stay alive is a bad thing. You shouldn't feel guilt.
00:02:28 That's bad.
00:02:29 What you could interpret from that is that time to, you know, like if you're not worrying
00:02:36 about inconveniencing yourself, you may as well just go and do it.
00:02:40 No, no, no, no. It's not what I mean. The idea was you're alive and you're really sad,
00:02:47 so you want to die. But you think about where you're going to die, like jumping off a bridge
00:02:53 or that ruins loads of people's day. Like your parents are going to be upset. Everyone's
00:02:58 going to be sad. It's like, oh, I don't want to feel, I don't want to make people upset.
00:03:03 That's not what, you know.
00:03:04 Sorry, I couldn't hear you for a minute there. Could you recap what you were just saying?
00:03:09 I'm just recapping what I was saying last time about guilt being a reason you stay alive.
00:03:16 And I think the reason guilt is a bad thing as a reason to stay alive is because it allows
00:03:22 you to not do anything. It is like a coward's way out in a strange way, because if you are
00:03:30 really sad with your life and everything sucks.
00:03:32 It's the coward's way out of the coward's way out.
00:03:34 Yeah, it is a way for you to say, well, I'm really sad and I want to die, but I can't
00:03:43 because of this, because I can't make people upset. And it sort of prevents you from forcing
00:03:48 yourself to ask the question of why live. And usually the solution to why live is happiness
00:03:57 or something like that. But the point I'm getting at is that if you're forced to ask
00:04:03 that question, you are going to be more proactive in making the solution, i.e. improving your
00:04:10 life to a point where you aren't sad anymore. And if you rely on the whole guilt thing to
00:04:16 keep you tethered to this mortal coil, you'll just be sad and be alive instead of trying
00:04:22 to improve yourself. That's my big suicide thought for the day.
00:04:29 So why live, hippo? Tell me. What's it all for?
00:04:39 Anime. Yeah. That's all I needed to hear.
00:04:45 Fuck. So I just watched Premiere last night. It was pretty cool. It definitely gave me a
00:04:51 reason to live. Oh yeah? Anime is pretty based, yeah.
00:04:56 That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. I almost watched Isoken, but then I was like,
00:05:02 that sounds boring. No, cool. It's so good.
00:05:06 You stupid shit. That's like the back of man of anime.
00:05:11 Okay. I was just, I was like, that's a back of man of creativity.
00:05:15 I was like, Ben, you know how you read bakuman? You're like, this is so fucking cool. But
00:05:19 at the same time, it's not me like, like this is really cool to see how like my favorite
00:05:24 manga is made. But like, I would never work like this. I would never be in this industry
00:05:28 because I'm not Japanese and I'm also not a professional. Like I just don't.
00:05:32 Isoken is like, oh, this is my brain autism. Like this is, this is how I think. It's just
00:05:38 like a random girl who's just like, I have big dreams and I'm going to make them happen.
00:05:43 And it's very much like exactly how us kind of people think. A small grassroots idea of
00:05:52 wanting to make something sick and just like being totally lost in their own head and then
00:05:57 like an actual smart, intelligent person with like business acumen, like slapping some sense
00:06:02 into that creative retardedness and being like, okay, we got to aim this in this direction
00:06:06 and make something actually happen. It's genius. It's brilliant. It's perfect.
00:06:11 It's okay from from bakuman who's like always depressed and says, oh, I can't do it. And
00:06:16 he has that one guy, his producer or whatever, who says, do it idiot. It's that.
00:06:21 Oh, he's my favorite. Yeah. Yeah.
00:06:26 Okay, that's all fine. Does it take place in high school?
00:06:30 No, it takes place in. It does take place in high school, but it is a like a very cool
00:06:37 like location. It's like made up.
00:06:40 But are they high schoolers?
00:06:42 They're in school, but like it's it's a silly school. It's like this.
00:06:45 You're a fucking silly school.
00:06:48 It's like it takes place in school just because they're young.
00:06:51 It has nothing to do with school at all.
00:06:53 Oh, that's okay. I hate that.
00:06:55 But all right.
00:06:57 They're going into the career world. That's part of the whole thing.
00:07:01 They're abusing and utilizing the advantages of being in school to get to kick a career.
00:07:08 Ben, Ben, the first the first big thing of this show is like how the school system is
00:07:14 hampering them and is keeping them down and is bad.
00:07:17 Yeah.
00:07:19 Okay, I just hate young people.
00:07:21 You know, that's fair.
00:07:23 I just hate them, but like that's just anime.
00:07:25 You know, they don't act like young people, though.
00:07:28 That's that's really the thing is that the characters anyone can relate to from any age.
00:07:33 I get it. I get it.
00:07:35 I get it.
00:07:37 This ageism is not very progressive.
00:07:39 I was I was just like it was I was just like maybe I should watch something and I was like
00:07:44 what's something people have told me is good.
00:07:46 Oh, I heard Isaac is pretty good.
00:07:48 But am I really willing to commit to watching a show?
00:07:51 No.
00:07:53 And that was my and that was what happened is a bit is a big ask.
00:07:55 It is a big ask.
00:07:56 I can't do it.
00:07:57 Guys, guys.
00:07:59 I have flowers to take care of.
00:08:02 I have a much smaller time commitment.
00:08:04 I haven't played Animal Crossing in like weeks.
00:08:06 I might I'm sure that I'm sure that Yaki Tori Island has gone to complete shit.
00:08:11 I hate art, guys.
00:08:13 I hate it.
00:08:14 It's it's bad.
00:08:15 It's all bad.
00:08:16 I mean, you're wrong.
00:08:17 What is the fucking point of it?
00:08:19 There is no point.
00:08:20 Yeah, exercise and narcissism.
00:08:22 It's just a fucking it's just a distraction.
00:08:25 It's just a waste of time.
00:08:27 It's all bullshit.
00:08:28 It's all it's all vanity.
00:08:30 You know, then it comes and steam rolls it anyway.
00:08:33 So what's the point?
00:08:34 Yeah.
00:08:35 I don't like it.
00:08:37 It's annoying.
00:08:38 It asks things of me when I see content.
00:08:41 I'm like, God, the absolute gall, the gall that this person has to expect me to to consume
00:08:49 this thing that they made.
00:08:51 Despicable.
00:08:52 I'm insulted.
00:08:54 See, I have been on a kick of completely the opposite mentality recently.
00:09:02 I guess this is Gibbs being a stupid fucking idiot corner.
00:09:06 So play that funny thing again.
00:09:08 Hit it.
00:09:09 This is the stupid idiot corner.
00:09:14 Hi, stupid idiot.
00:09:16 Because of the the manga stuff, the Clarissa, the the struggles, I've been like,
00:09:24 I don't have anything in my brain.
00:09:26 I don't know how to make anything.
00:09:28 I just I figured out the solution or I was told the solution.
00:09:33 I don't remember whether it was my idea or not.
00:09:36 But I've been binging cool movies that I've been told about and I've been researching
00:09:42 and I've been looking up directors names and what that influenced them and going back in
00:09:47 time to like the 1920s.
00:09:50 And I've just been it's just so fun to watch films with the intent of gaining a bit of
00:09:56 knowledge from them as to how to be cool and make my own cool art.
00:10:01 And I've basically been watching a bunch of Westerns.
00:10:05 I started with the good, the bad and the ugly because that's like the big one that I've
00:10:08 heard of.
00:10:09 And I've been going from that backwards to Akira Kurosawa with Seven Samurai and all
00:10:15 his like Western inspired samurai films that inspired Sergio Leone.
00:10:19 And then you go back from Akira Kurosawa to John Ford and things like Stagecoach and
00:10:25 and High Noon and all these old shit, black and white, even silent films.
00:10:30 It's great.
00:10:31 I love art.
00:10:32 I love seeing how things have inspired people and what is like considered a classic master
00:10:39 piece.
00:10:40 And I'm like looking at it.
00:10:42 I love art so much.
00:10:45 Anything made like today sucks.
00:10:47 Anything made like a year ago sucks.
00:10:49 Everything that is not old is bad.
00:10:51 Old good new bad.
00:10:53 Yeah.
00:10:54 Yeah.
00:10:55 Yeah.
00:10:56 Old good.
00:10:57 Like it's old.
00:10:58 And I've heard of it.
00:10:59 It's old and good because I've heard of it and it's old.
00:11:02 That's true.
00:11:04 Okay.
00:11:05 I mean, that's pretty persuasive argument, I guess.
00:11:09 So like Akira Kurosawa, the Seven Samurai, heard of that a lot.
00:11:15 Yeah.
00:11:16 It's really good.
00:11:17 It's my favorite anime.
00:11:19 The Kikucho, or whoever you say it, Kikucho, Kikucho.
00:11:23 They say it real quick in Japanese.
00:11:25 Those guys, they speak real quick.
00:11:28 Okay.
00:11:29 But he is like my favorite character archetype.
00:11:33 Which one?
00:11:34 The like wandering guy?
00:11:37 The sort of crazy guy with the biggest sword and the scowling and the jumping and the screaming.
00:11:44 Yeah.
00:11:45 Yeah.
00:11:46 I think that's like my favorite.
00:11:48 I think that's the only Kurosawa I've seen.
00:11:51 I think I've seen any.
00:11:52 But M.Dot talks about Seven Samurai all the time.
00:11:54 How is a huge influence on like, maybe I should watch that.
00:11:57 And it's been like 15 years and I still haven't done it yet.
00:11:59 Yeah.
00:12:00 You can find it pretty easily.
00:12:01 I googled things.
00:12:03 I found like a whole free version on a like a criterion collection archive website thing.
00:12:10 Dude, archive.org has like tons of shit.
00:12:13 Like, I've just been like watching all the Godzilla movies again.
00:12:16 You just go on archive.org and they have 1080p uploads of like every Godzilla movie ever.
00:12:21 I'm like, oh my God.
00:12:22 Why would I ever buy things ever?
00:12:24 This is so stupid.
00:12:25 Yeah.
00:12:26 It's all just right.
00:12:27 That's the other cool thing about all of shit is that it's free.
00:12:30 You can just have it.
00:12:31 Nobody cares.
00:12:32 It is pretty good.
00:12:33 Yeah.
00:12:34 All right.
00:12:35 All right.
00:12:36 We're coming around.
00:12:37 I was coming.
00:12:38 I was going in these old like Westerns and I was like, oh, inspired by a novel.
00:12:42 You know what?
00:12:43 The next step for my like research, my artistic smart boy research is like, imagine me in a
00:12:49 library reading.
00:12:50 So I'm going to read books based on like the inspired these Western films from the 1920s.
00:12:56 And they're just all free on online.
00:12:59 They're just PDFs, like links upon links of free PDFs of books and e-books.
00:13:03 I just have them.
00:13:05 I just have them now.
00:13:07 It's so easy.
00:13:08 Too much power.
00:13:09 Too much power.
00:13:10 Why get an audible account?
00:13:11 Why?
00:13:12 Why would you ever pay money for anything when all of this free shit exists?
00:13:15 That's the whole thing.
00:13:16 You just get sucked into that.
00:13:17 Oh, it's so easy.
00:13:18 I can just pay Amazon more money and make Jeff Bezos even richer and get access to all these
00:13:23 books.
00:13:24 But it's just like, no, it's all here.
00:13:25 It's all here to be stolen.
00:13:27 And that's the way it should be.
00:13:28 I guess I was going to, I guess I'm sort of supposed to read debt again for the, for
00:13:35 Munchies book club.
00:13:36 I said I would do it, but I haven't done it yet.
00:13:39 I keep getting notifications from that.
00:13:41 And I'm just like, hmm, no, I've got other things to do.
00:13:45 I'm going to stay uncultured and safe.
00:13:49 Yeah.
00:13:50 Stupid.
00:13:51 Stupid ass.
00:13:52 That's me.
00:13:53 I've been on, I've been, so I hate art now.
00:13:57 This coincides with me actually starting to make some again.
00:14:02 You know, it's bad.
00:14:04 Like all art is bad.
00:14:06 But I keep, I keep doing it.
00:14:08 I've, I've actually guys, I've actually made progress on fucking slime and punishment
00:14:15 finale.
00:14:16 It's actually getting done again.
00:14:17 Holy shit.
00:14:18 I know.
00:14:19 I know.
00:14:20 I will be so fucking relieved.
00:14:22 I'll be so fucking relieved to have that done.
00:14:25 I'll be relieved when I get my fucking Vapors book.
00:14:29 Vapors book.
00:14:30 Munchie.
00:14:31 Munchie or a Kazi is done with her, her thing.
00:14:34 Oh yeah, I saw.
00:14:35 Munchie is almost, wait, you saw hers?
00:14:38 Where?
00:14:39 I saw her say that she finished.
00:14:41 Oh, okay.
00:14:42 Okay.
00:14:43 Munchie is like getting close to being done and then Jade, I don't know where Jade is.
00:14:48 I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to pick on her some more.
00:14:51 That's fair.
00:14:52 Yeah.
00:14:53 But it's getting there.
00:14:54 It's getting, it's getting there.
00:14:56 Things, things by, by, by waiting long enough, I made it happen.
00:15:01 Things are looking up.
00:15:02 You know,
00:15:03 Excellent.
00:15:04 It only took months of inaction for something to happen.
00:15:07 That's sometimes that's what it takes.
00:15:09 Yeah.
00:15:10 Yeah.
00:15:11 Yeah.
00:15:12 Speaking of months of inaction, I wanted to announce before I forget that when, when you
00:15:21 have five listeners who ventured away from the YouTube plantation to find us on the outskirts
00:15:26 of Google podcasts or iTunes or wherever.
00:15:28 So I want to let you know that as of you're listening to this, all of the radcon for rewards
00:15:35 will be in transit to you.
00:15:37 No.
00:15:38 They're shit.
00:15:39 They are packed.
00:15:40 They are done.
00:15:41 The only things that are not taken care of yet are those large posters because those have
00:15:47 to be packed separately.
00:15:48 They're at Digi's.
00:15:49 She refuses to send them to me.
00:15:52 I don't know when that will be resolved, but everything else is packed.
00:15:55 Everything in my possession that I had control over directly with my responsible boy powers
00:16:01 has been created, packed, labeled, assembled and shipped.
00:16:06 It will be in transit.
00:16:07 People are already getting them.
00:16:08 You can see on Twitter people are already getting their packages.
00:16:11 I saw somebody go to a pin.
00:16:14 Did you also do the calendar?
00:16:16 I did.
00:16:17 The calendars are done.
00:16:18 Oh, shit.
00:16:19 I have extras.
00:16:20 So if you guys want to frame our debauchery all the time, how do they look?
00:16:24 Oh, no, no, no.
00:16:25 I don't want a calendar.
00:16:26 They look pretty damn good.
00:16:27 I like that.
00:16:28 The print quality is better than I was anticipating.
00:16:30 We got a really good deal on them.
00:16:32 I haggled them down.
00:16:33 It was pretty good.
00:16:34 Oh, shit.
00:16:35 I just realized one of those calendars coming to my house because my brother pledged.
00:16:39 Yep.
00:16:40 I packed that up.
00:16:41 I saw that.
00:16:42 Oh, no.
00:16:43 He's going to have.
00:16:44 Oh, I cut him.
00:16:46 Think about it.
00:16:47 All of next year, you go into his room.
00:16:49 It's going to be there mocking you.
00:16:51 Well, only on some of them months, hopefully.
00:16:54 I want to see.
00:16:55 I want to see post a picture of the calendar for me so I can.
00:17:00 I can go grab one and take a picture of my phone.
00:17:03 I mean, I guess there's no hurry.
00:17:05 If you care that much.
00:17:06 And I said, I don't care that much.
00:17:08 I'll see you eventually.
00:17:11 Der.
00:17:13 What?
00:17:14 What are the rewards were there?
00:17:16 There was the pin.
00:17:18 There was the shirt.
00:17:19 There was the calendar.
00:17:20 The pin is the pin.
00:17:21 There was the small poster, which and then there's the larger poster, which is signed.
00:17:26 And I remember if there was anything else.
00:17:29 That's pretty much it.
00:17:31 It was not a whole lot in terms of physical items.
00:17:35 What about PC pennies?
00:17:39 Meetup only.
00:17:40 Oh, meetup only.
00:17:41 Okay, that's right.
00:17:42 That's right.
00:17:43 Collect his items.
00:17:44 Do you want to talk about like progress that's been made on the other things that were funded?
00:17:52 Is there much to even talk about yet?
00:17:54 I feel like we're still kind of.
00:17:56 Well, I was going to.
00:17:57 I didn't ask in the chat earlier, but I was I was going to ask about the the the OVA.
00:18:05 I mean, like we were doing.
00:18:06 There was progress there.
00:18:08 There was progress.
00:18:09 Yeah.
00:18:10 And I haven't heard anything about it a little while.
00:18:12 Okay.
00:18:13 I need to follow up on that.
00:18:15 It's the, I don't know how much to say, but like the OP is like an animation OP.
00:18:21 That's that's the thing we're currently working on.
00:18:24 Yeah, I'm talking to people about it.
00:18:26 And it's just because it took a while to get sorted.
00:18:32 The people who we had have like other work.
00:18:36 Oh, no.
00:18:38 So like they're just being slower, but it's it'll happen.
00:18:42 Don't worry about it.
00:18:43 Okay.
00:18:44 I did post some.
00:18:48 I did.
00:18:49 I did leak a little bit.
00:18:50 I did leak a little bit on my on my on my Patreon.
00:18:54 Just just a little just a little smidge just a little smidgen of my own shit.
00:19:00 It's fine.
00:19:01 Nobody owns me.
00:19:02 No one can tell me what to do.
00:19:04 Damn destroyed.
00:19:06 You're not nobody.
00:19:07 You're not cops.
00:19:08 Don't be a cop.
00:19:11 But I'm really stoked about that.
00:19:13 I was looking.
00:19:14 Well, I you say you say it's like they've got other work and it's slowed down.
00:19:19 That's that's gay.
00:19:21 It was looking pretty cool.
00:19:23 Last night.
00:19:24 Yeah.
00:19:25 I don't think we've talked anything about this publicly yet.
00:19:29 I really should.
00:19:30 Should we not?
00:19:31 Should we not?
00:19:32 Should I not have brought it up?
00:19:34 It's fine.
00:19:35 It's whatever.
00:19:36 Everybody knows it's coming.
00:19:37 Like they played.
00:19:38 We did.
00:19:39 We did promise it.
00:19:40 Yeah.
00:19:41 Yeah.
00:19:42 All right.
00:19:43 Well, I'll speak.
00:19:44 We don't we don't we don't we don't have to go.
00:19:45 We don't have to go into like any specifics about what it is.
00:19:48 No, no, no.
00:19:49 Yeah.
00:19:50 Yeah.
00:19:51 Because I don't want to make it seem worse than it is at the moment.
00:19:53 We have been getting like character designs like us as anime characters.
00:19:58 Designed based on what we look like in in our silly like OVA designs.
00:20:03 Oh, it's those have been worked on those are looking pretty great and they're basically
00:20:08 done after that.
00:20:10 The next phase is to start the the storyboard and animation and it shouldn't take too long
00:20:19 once we get started.
00:20:20 It's just that the character designer is the person who has got other work while they
00:20:24 were waiting for us to to like give feedback on the tweaks of like, oh, this character
00:20:30 needs this more of this and that.
00:20:33 And then we've been there's been a back and forth process.
00:20:36 Yeah.
00:20:37 But once the character designs are finalized, we can go to the animator and then we get
00:20:40 over what I've done.
00:20:41 That's why I made I made tweaks to mine.
00:20:44 And that was the last I ever heard of it.
00:20:46 I never saw them.
00:20:47 I never saw my my my very important changes implemented.
00:20:52 Yes, that's the one I'm weighing on.
00:20:54 I follow up on my guys.
00:20:57 I'll say what my my notes were like a bigger tits have the tits bulging out of the top
00:21:03 please have them fucking sloshing around and fucking jutting out and just exploding out
00:21:08 of this thing.
00:21:09 Have them be disgustingly big, but not big enough.
00:21:12 This is an embarrassment.
00:21:13 Fix it right now.
00:21:14 Also make the eyes purple.
00:21:15 Purple's better.
00:21:16 But the bigger tits mostly.
00:21:18 Thank you very much.
00:21:19 Good night.
00:21:21 I relayed all of I relayed all of your notes.
00:21:24 Good, good.
00:21:25 And it was just like pages of that just typed in a Word document.
00:21:29 I can't wait for the OVA to finally be finished and Ben finally gets it in his inbox.
00:21:34 He's just like, I can't be bothered to watch art and just doesn't look at it.
00:21:38 Yeah, I won't.
00:21:39 I won't fucking watch it.
00:21:41 I can't be fucking bothered, but it's going to be it'll be a waste of my like how long
00:21:45 is going to be like a minute.
00:21:47 I can't I can't spare it.
00:21:49 One whole minute.
00:21:51 One whole minute.
00:21:52 No.
00:21:53 I have to spend that minute making.
00:21:57 I have to spend them in doing the Simon punishment finale.
00:22:00 My dudes, it's coming.
00:22:01 It's coming.
00:22:02 It looks really good.
00:22:03 I've got I've gotten I'm getting fancy.
00:22:06 I'm doing some fancy cinema.
00:22:08 I'm doing I'm doing cuts.
00:22:09 I'm doing swipes and fades.
00:22:12 Yeah.
00:22:13 Yeah.
00:22:14 Timing.
00:22:15 Oh man.
00:22:16 Timing.
00:22:17 Timing is really fun timing things to to happen again and just like you change a few frames
00:22:23 and you're like, oh, it works so much better.
00:22:25 Yeah, I like that.
00:22:27 Yeah, yeah.
00:22:28 I have it all.
00:22:29 I don't have the music yet.
00:22:31 I'm just kind of like putting it all together and like it's all like it can all be I'm going
00:22:36 to have to go back and like change the timing on everything.
00:22:39 So like make it fit to like the beat or whatever.
00:22:43 Yeah.
00:22:44 I don't know about that.
00:22:46 I guess it depends on how much animation you're doing what do you mean when I was doing when I was doing belgap finale
00:22:52 I couldn't imagine animating or storyboarding anything before I knew what the song wasn't how long it was gonna be I
00:22:59 Had I had to have it finished and then I didn't want to wait too long for the song to be finished or like
00:23:05 Be good. Yeah, that's why it sucks
00:23:08 I
00:23:11 Had well, I made the storyboard first and then um cuz um I was talking to I was talking to
00:23:17 Sixon six and was gonna do a little little music for it
00:23:20 And I gave him the the storyboard and I guess he was gonna fuck around with a make a little make a little tune for it or whatever
00:23:29 But so like the beats are already there and it's just a matter of like how long each one lasts
00:23:37 I've sort of been
00:23:38 I've sort of just kind of been putting everything together
00:23:41 With the assumption that like every like major like cut or event happens on every like four seconds or so
00:23:47 So everything is kind of like in a regular pattern
00:23:51 and um
00:23:53 I don't know. I'll just have to like fiddle with it when it's done
00:23:58 uh, or maybe if something needs to go on a little longer, I can just get like a
00:24:01 A
00:24:02 Little piece of the song to like just play a little longer or a little shorter or something or whatever. Yeah
00:24:08 I'll figure it out. I'm gonna figure it out as I go
00:24:11 Um looks really nice. It looks very it's very homestuck. It's very uh, it's very, um
00:24:19 It's a big kind of sure it's gonna be really cool. Thank you
00:24:23 It's it looks really cool. There's there's there's big it has a really good sense of scale
00:24:28 I think is what I've tried to capture
00:24:31 with it and I think I think it
00:24:33 It's got some nice little transition. I don't know. This is all stupid. This is all stupid to talk about this
00:24:40 Uh, if you'd like if you hadn't if you don't know what it looks like
00:24:43 It doesn't mean anything for me to say. Oh, yeah
00:24:46 Some really nice work. I did on those. Yeah, you know what guys? I'm just so cool. You know that? Yeah
00:24:52 Yeah, when this finally comes out someone will sync up the footage to this part of the podcast
00:24:58 And it's like we'll finally understand
00:25:01 I'll make sense now. Ben is an idiot. Ben doesn't know what he's talking about. I get it
00:25:06 Uh, hell
00:25:09 I feel like I've been I've been stressing a little bit on on making this uh, Tezuka manga thing
00:25:16 The goodest it could possibly be. I don't want anyone to think I'm bad in any way and I'm constantly improving and
00:25:22 Oh, they couldn't possibly be a dud. It couldn't possibly be like all this effort wasted
00:25:27 No, it has to be the best thing ever. I have to win the contest. In fact, I
00:25:32 I'll kill myself if I don't win. That's what I've been saying every day every night before I go to bed
00:25:37 I say I'm gonna die. That's what I say
00:25:40 Uh, I think that's a healthy outlook. Yeah, that sounds really healthy. Definitely keep doing that. What have you been
00:25:47 doing to make it
00:25:49 Like what like give me give me a practical example
00:25:53 Of like how you've been handling it
00:25:56 Well, uh, as I as it was saying
00:25:59 um
00:26:00 Watching a lot of films to get inspiration
00:26:03 uh
00:26:05 So
00:26:06 I'm getting a lot of western have you tried smoking weed?
00:26:10 No, no, no, no. It's much easier
00:26:13 Uh, then making art. Yes. I'm I'm sure it is watching movies
00:26:19 You can do both at the same time. I guess I guess
00:26:21 Yeah, I don't know where to find weed
00:26:24 I go out into the to the park and I cut like grass bits and roll it up into a thing
00:26:29 The answer is and then I smoke and it was not weed at all
00:26:32 It was I throw it down to in disgust go to the nearest college campus and look for any guy in a tie-dye shirt
00:26:40 And ask him
00:26:41 That's how you do it. Oh wait coronavirus never mind
00:26:46 Whoops, okay
00:26:48 All right, look for a guy in a tie-dye
00:26:50 Uh face mask
00:26:52 Tell tell tell me more you've been you've been stressing about the tessica thing
00:26:56 I've been stressing about it being good. Yeah, um
00:27:00 and I've been
00:27:02 Uh, first off I I spent a while a few like a week or so just thinking about ideas
00:27:09 scribbling down on bits of paper opening and closing notepad documents and google documents just
00:27:14 Trying to come up with ideas. I came up with some good things some bad things
00:27:19 And then I was like, okay, if I'm gonna be like punctual I need to
00:27:23 like move on
00:27:24 Before I get too bogged down
00:27:27 And so I tried to start sketching it and then I realized I don't know what any of the west looks like
00:27:33 um
00:27:34 and uh
00:27:35 I think something some complication happened in the middle of june
00:27:38 I got depressed and I didn't do anything now. I've been watching films to get like
00:27:42 understanding of what the west is
00:27:44 Because I I I haven't seen that many western films even though I know that I like it and it's really cool
00:27:51 um
00:27:52 So I've been like gathering a
00:27:54 input so that I can output
00:27:57 Things so I can output art. I need to input what art looks like
00:28:02 You know, you can't you can't be a great artist unless you see great art. So
00:28:06 Um, I'm at this. I'm at the stage where I think I've seen enough films and I'm going to
00:28:14 really try
00:28:15 to
00:28:17 Make a a script that is better than the one I made before
00:28:21 and then sketch
00:28:23 and then
00:28:24 Oh, I hope it's good
00:28:27 Okay
00:28:29 I I don't know whether I answered your question or not. No
00:28:33 No
00:28:35 Not really not really. I don't know. I feel like june was like a weird month for me as well because like I
00:28:42 Had I started I started june with a contest, right? I had a contest on twitter my character design contest
00:28:48 Uh for an izumi project. I'm working on I got a bunch of people who submitted ideas. They were great
00:28:53 I think I'm actually going to rewrite the part of the script
00:28:55 I was going to have they had these characters in it because the designs were so good
00:28:58 And I want them to have a bigger role because it was a very small role before
00:29:02 uh
00:29:03 but
00:29:04 In the middle of working on this in june, I was like, oh god, I'm like so bad. I'm so bad. Everything sucks. This is bad
00:29:10 My ideas cannot be expressed properly with my baby's tier skills. So I just kind of stopped working on that project
00:29:16 I'm just been like consuming
00:29:18 Courses I have like my cg cookie subscription. I'm just like I got to learn everything
00:29:22 I got to learn all this stuff and get better and smarter and gooder
00:29:24 And I just kind of like dropped off the face of the planet
00:29:27 And I'm just trying to learn edge flow and topology
00:29:30 And I started learning 3d sculpting and I feel like I've become more powerful but not enough to actually
00:29:35 Coalesce the power into something usable. It's just like a sun exploding in my face
00:29:40 And I don't know how to control it and it's been very frustrating
00:29:44 But also kind of cool at the same time to be exposed all these new ideas and new ways of working that
00:29:49 At some point when I get dope enough will allow me to transcend
00:29:54 Time and space but until then I just stare in awe into the abyss beyond my comprehension that
00:29:59 That's what's been fucking me up is this
00:30:02 This obsession with gathering skill before making anything
00:30:06 Because it's like I feel like I'm going on that at the moment like when I did a few sketches
00:30:12 I had at one scene pretty firmly in my mind and I tried to draw it
00:30:16 um some of the things like how
00:30:19 It starts I wasn't sure about but I knew one moment in that scene
00:30:24 It's very clearly in my mind and I sketched it out and I drew a really really good panel
00:30:29 Like a really really good sequence of panels. It was like the best panel layout
00:30:33 Individual images and it was a sketch and I just magically did it and I was like damn if I can do that
00:30:40 Everything has to be that good. I can't possibly like live with myself if
00:30:46 Like page one is not as good as this page all the pages have to be this good
00:30:49 And so everything that happens in page one. I have to fine-tune so that is like a perfectly realized
00:30:56 thing and I
00:30:57 I don't have the skills yet to make that work
00:31:00 I need to look at panel layouts and mangas and look at things and films and see like
00:31:05 How they how they block a scene and
00:31:08 Oh, no, everything. Oh, no
00:31:11 No, everything else just has to like get
00:31:14 Everything else just has to get you to the the the important part that you drew the good that you drew good
00:31:21 It's true. It doesn't all have to be good. It can all be bad. I don't know
00:31:25 I like this is not like my preferred work method. It is just what I am noticing
00:31:31 I'm doing is like obsessing over
00:31:33 gaining
00:31:34 power before I like make my move even though
00:31:38 It'll never it'll never just run out of time. It'll never be enough. Yeah
00:31:42 Yeah, I mean also that I like spent you can't live you can't live like this
00:31:47 I spent the first week of june like tweaking my zumi model to make it better
00:31:51 And I was like, all right sick
00:31:53 I like re-rigged it and I changed some of the the design and stuff and it looks really good
00:31:57 And then like a week later. It's like, I'm throwing this whole thing out. It sucks
00:32:00 I got to remake it from scratch now that I learned better. So it's just like I'm sure as soon as this is done
00:32:04 I'm gonna learn something else. I'm like, oh, this is garbage. I gotta do it again
00:32:08 It just never ends. It's always a constant
00:32:11 struggle
00:32:12 But like to go back to what you were saying give I think something it's like interesting because I was I noticed this while watching primary yesterday
00:32:18 Is that like they have these like ridiculously over-the-top choreographed action sequences that are just like full of like 3d and like camera rotation and dynamic perspective
00:32:26 And all this like ridiculous insane shit and I'm just sitting there like how did they fucking think of this?
00:32:31 but then like the dialogue stuff to get you in between those scenes it's like
00:32:35 static shots
00:32:36 Just what you need to get the point across and like a lot of the times the characters will animate in like two frames
00:32:42 Just for the sake of efficiency to like get us from point A to point B
00:32:46 And I think like all art does that right like you got to put your time
00:32:50 In the most important part. So if you have like a really cool scene that's like really well choreographed and like like
00:32:56 I've one or two pages of really intense shit
00:32:58 Like there's almost like a sense of flow where if you're firing on all cylinders the entire time
00:33:04 It's gonna loot that scene's gonna lose its impact. So if you have something more simple
00:33:09 Like adjacent to it
00:33:11 It makes that sudden dynamism hit way harder and that scene actually gets better by the stuff preceding it being
00:33:18 less
00:33:19 I don't want to say creative but like less dynamic almost
00:33:22 So yeah, it's not so much dynamic as in good. It's just sort of
00:33:29 When I do the sketches
00:33:32 One thing I know is that they need to be
00:33:36 Um
00:33:37 They need to be realized enough so that when I'm doing the line
00:33:40 I don't need to think I can just copy the lines
00:33:43 You can just draw what is there
00:33:45 and uh
00:33:47 This often happens with backgrounds where I don't care about what's in the background
00:33:51 Um, it's a character moving from one part of something to another part and I need a panel to show that they're doing that
00:33:57 um
00:33:58 And I draw the panel like a sketch like just a cuboid takes this much space out of the page
00:34:04 Sure, then the next panel's here
00:34:06 Um, and when I sketch it, I'm like, I don't know if I can what where to put the character
00:34:11 Here, I guess it's just sort of like
00:34:14 The panel exists and it's not very well
00:34:17 Realized in my mind as to what it should look like
00:34:21 and I've been
00:34:23 I don't know
00:34:24 It's it's hard to go over panels that I don't care about and try to make them
00:34:30 Have a purpose
00:34:32 Uh, I don't really know how to explain it
00:34:35 I think it's just
00:34:37 There are parts of the story that are just there as transition
00:34:41 As opposed to like you're super invested in because like there's always parts of a story
00:34:45 You're more excited to tell than other parts. There are parts that like kind of have to be there
00:34:48 Then they're like the parts you're really excited about
00:34:51 um
00:34:52 I don't know. I guess I guess I just I dislike in in background specifically having
00:34:58 Oh the cuboid building with the square
00:35:02 Um holes in it that are windows. It is just a cuboid. It has no features is nothing
00:35:07 Um, I look at that and I'm like, oh, I suck. Why why is this building not a real building?
00:35:13 and so I sort of
00:35:14 Maybe I don't know if I overcompensate or
00:35:17 Slightly overcompensate, but I try to think what what is this building?
00:35:22 What is its use in this town?
00:35:24 Oh
00:35:25 Why is it in this location? What is next to it? Why is that next to it? How do this town come to be?
00:35:30 Why, you know, where's the water where they get the water from where they get the food from?
00:35:34 Uh, what are the what are the the natural barriers to entry?
00:35:38 Is there like a mountain range like I think of all these things and I feel like I can't depict anything until I know everything
00:35:46 I need to like plot out the entire area
00:35:49 And that's such a daunting task. I'm like, I don't want to plot out the entire area
00:35:53 Just so I can know what this building is supposed to look like you just you just got a you just got a
00:35:59 Just make shit up whatever you need there to be a mountain. Oh, yeah, there's a mountain
00:36:03 There's always been a mountain
00:36:05 We just never saw the the landscape from the right angle before but it was I mean one of the I always I I feel like I
00:36:12 need to make it
00:36:14 make um
00:36:16 Consistent sense like if you see a mountain from one window from one side of a building out the window
00:36:21 When you go out the building it should be on that same side of the building
00:36:25 I mean, I think that's that's not a bad thing for like your own mind to like keep the space consistent
00:36:31 But I don't I think a I don't think most people will even notice those kinds of things
00:36:35 Um, which is not to say that it's not important to have spatial awareness of where your setting is
00:36:40 Um, but I just think sweating it too much might be more trouble than it's worth
00:36:43 But also like you're making a manga like a black and white manga
00:36:47 So like
00:36:48 99 of the time the panels won't even have backgrounds
00:36:51 You know because like a good a good question to ask yourself is like is this background serving a purpose, right?
00:36:57 Because like if you have a really detailed background like if you
00:37:00 Go and design your entire location and you know where every building is in every point the character is standing at and you go
00:37:06 And render out those buildings in exquisite detail
00:37:10 You're almost detracting from the center
00:37:12 Like point of the panel which is probably to show a character doing something
00:37:15 And you're you could risk adding too much visual clutter to the panel
00:37:19 So I think a lot of the times when manga chooses to not have a background and just have it be white
00:37:24 Like not only is that a time saving technique because they have like seven days to turn around like 20 pages
00:37:29 But it also keeps the focus of the reader on the character and any dialogue that might be spoken
00:37:34 And prevents their eyes from wandering around getting lost in extraneous details that might not serve the story
00:37:40 So just just be a vague right like any okay
00:37:44 Anything anything that's relevant to like the immediate story at hand that's happening right now
00:37:50 You should show in the panel
00:37:52 And anything that isn't relevant you like don't have to show so like
00:37:57 It doesn't it doesn't matter if like if like later on you decide like oh there was a uh that you had this this this
00:38:04 Place is in a it's in a volcano. This is in this is in a this is in a cave or whatever. I don't know
00:38:11 Uh, you just you just don't
00:38:13 You just don't you don't have to do anything with it
00:38:16 It can it can remain like just just just kind of outside of one's awareness until
00:38:22 They're they're like there'd be no reason to have to include details
00:38:25 Until they become relevant anyway. You know what I mean?
00:38:29 Hmm stupid I did a terrible job
00:38:33 No, I I get it. It's I I guess I just sort of have like a fear or like um
00:38:41 Not a fear but like a the the prospect of like
00:38:45 Crafting a story and then telling the story
00:38:47 Non linearly it's like oh my god. I can't imagine
00:38:51 Can't imagine a story growing as I draw it as I write it
00:38:54 I I need to know everything that happens and then I just need to draw it. That's what that's how you do things
00:38:59 That's not necessarily always the right way to do it. Is that how is that how you always do things?
00:39:05 Um for the load of ghosts. I I made it. I made up what it would be
00:39:11 plot-wise
00:39:12 Entirely before and then I made up
00:39:15 Uh, how it looked as I went
00:39:18 Um for bail jpe. I made up everything as I went and I didn't give a shit
00:39:22 I was gonna say bail jpe was not you didn't have you didn't know how bail jpe was gonna end when you started it, right?
00:39:28 Yeah, I had no idea I would even have like a like anything like I thought it would just be like a tiny little joke
00:39:38 And instead it's a real big joke
00:39:40 Yeah
00:39:42 By the way, you asked you asked sorry
00:39:47 Sorry to change the subject. I don't mean to but since you mentioned bail jpe
00:39:50 You asked you asked how much like animation there is in uh slime and punishment finale
00:39:56 Like very little there's like
00:39:58 It's almost all just like static objects like moving and trend like trend like scene transitions
00:40:04 There's like there's one scene
00:40:06 There's like one or two little shots where people will probably have a little like two frames of like
00:40:11 They like go from one pose to another
00:40:14 And that's like yeah, that's that's that's yeah
00:40:17 That's the homestuck thing. Yes, it is that so much of it is like um scale and rotate and
00:40:25 Shake and flash
00:40:27 Yeah, that's efficient. You can get a lot of you can get a lot of mileage you get a lot of mileage out of just
00:40:33 Having like static images move around a screen
00:40:38 I should have done that why did I
00:40:43 It's too late. I've already spent the time it's cool now. Yeah
00:40:47 Yeah
00:40:49 No, dude
00:40:51 I won't I I I I'm I'm I'm resisting the urge to talk more about that
00:40:56 I don't want to say anything about what what goes on in it until it's out
00:41:01 Yeah, the I I guess this whole bit has been give being a stupid fucking idiot. Yeah, play the jingle again
00:41:08 Play the jingle like every five minutes play the jingle
00:41:15 I don't even know there's a jingle I've missed a lot apparently I well
00:41:18 There's only been the last episode that I coined the term I haven't even listened to the jingle
00:41:22 I just know it exists. I don't is there I don't know if ellie is are actually added a jingle or not
00:41:28 He made one I'm posted there. I just didn't play it. Okay, and I I didn't see what it sounded like before the episode was edited
00:41:36 Yeah
00:41:40 But I'm sure it's cool
00:41:43 Yeah, I I need
00:41:45 To I need to stop thinking
00:41:48 But it's hard
00:41:50 You can't just draw. What are you insane? You put a pen to a paper
00:41:55 You just draw a line and it becomes something that's how it works. That would be really cringe
00:42:02 If your art doesn't be creative on the fly, it's pretty cringe. I watched
00:42:07 I watched another there was a new a new mon ben someone on twitter
00:42:12 Uh outrider sake on twitter added me to let me know ben somebody uploaded a new mon ben
00:42:19 on daily motion
00:42:21 the one the one where
00:42:23 The one where urisawa nowki
00:42:25 Like talks to manga people and films them working and stuff. Right, uh, it was
00:42:33 When I watch mon ben I get I get a sense like it's cool
00:42:38 it's cool to see
00:42:40 Artists like working so hard on like making their shit
00:42:44 But I also
00:42:46 Have a strange feeling of like why
00:42:49 Are they even bothering like this is cringe like why are they doing like it's stupid. What are they established or something?
00:42:57 Yeah, it's like what what's what's the purpose what purpose does this serve?
00:43:02 And then and then they're gonna eat and then them and nowki will be like, oh, yeah
00:43:07 Uh art really is you know the artist's expression really is like a pure expression of fetishism
00:43:14 You know, it's like, yeah
00:43:16 Uh, uh, it's the the part, you know the kai I've always had a really intense emotional
00:43:22 Experience with like the human clavicle and that and everyone says that like that's why I draw it so good and like, oh, yeah
00:43:28 I like I you know, I want to express my fucking my fucking anxiety through a through a
00:43:34 Something or other and there was this highfalutin
00:43:37 Shit, and I'm like cringe
00:43:39 Just fucking just just just just quit
00:43:43 If they if they were good at explaining why they do what they do they wouldn't do what they do
00:43:48 They'd be explaining other people things. That's true. It's it's I don't know they always
00:43:55 Nowki always, um
00:43:57 He talks a lot about fetishism
00:43:59 But like all he means by it every time he says it he just means like
00:44:04 Liking something it's just like something you're interested in like liking to draw shoulders
00:44:09 Do you think it's just a translation thing? Do you think they're just saying fetishism in the translation when it could be something more literal?
00:44:15 I think maybe the word I think they say it in English like they use the English word and I think just maybe it has a different connotation
00:44:22 Oh something that's interesting
00:44:25 I I I'm talking about it like I'm
00:44:29 This probably makes it sound like I hate the show and I don't even like it anymore
00:44:33 But I do I just feel I just feel weird
00:44:37 About art in general art is so cringe because it becomes base and you want to be that cringe so you can be that base
00:44:43 But you can't bridge the gap yet
00:44:46 Yeah, it's like they'll be like oh so-and-so has been working for like 14 years writing a
00:44:54 It's a it's a manga about a
00:44:56 A girl from a from a tribe that has to like fight against like an
00:45:00 Ineval empire or something and like free her and I'm like I hear that and I'm like, okay. I get it
00:45:07 Like all right got got it
00:45:11 What's what's the point? I mean, that's just the synopsis
00:45:16 Nobody goes around reading synopsises
00:45:18 But I feel like I feel like I don't know maybe this is dumb
00:45:21 But I feel like I feel like the synopsis is all I need
00:45:25 And I don't I don't like I don't know
00:45:29 It's very uncharitable and it's probably stupid, but like I'm like, I mean maybe you're just tired of like
00:45:35 Narratives that get repeated
00:45:38 Right, but all narratives get repeated. That's why all art is bad
00:45:41 Or art can only be good when it's new and there hasn't been any new art ever
00:45:47 So no art can only be good when it's old old good
00:45:51 Well, it was
00:45:52 It was it was new
00:45:54 It was new when it was old though. That's why it was good because it was it was new at the time
00:46:01 Now everything now everything is old because the old stuff was new
00:46:06 First wait, I think I think you mixed up a word there or two. No, I don't I think I got it exactly right
00:46:12 The idea was fresh new ideas are not fresh because the old ideas were fresh
00:46:18 When they came out
00:46:19 We just got to wait
00:46:20 We just got to wait until we're old and then the things that are coming out today will be good
00:46:25 Because they'll be old. No, they won't they won't I promise it'll never happen anything old people are the most based thing
00:46:31 You could be you go, oh, and you're like, I can't walk anymore and you're like, I can't wait until like
00:46:37 2050 when there's like fucking like 65 year old men like oh, yeah, I remember back when
00:46:44 Movies were good. Remember iron man. Ah, it was a classic. Remember remember the first iron man. Yeah, that was that was that was it
00:46:53 Everything it's all been downhill from there
00:46:57 We went into that cave and he made an iron man suit out of scrap. How do you do that?
00:47:03 How do you do that? He's so smart
00:47:05 I
00:47:07 Fucking hate movies
00:47:13 It's unbearable
00:47:15 Imagine imagine sitting down to watch a sequence of images played at a high frame rate to create the illusion of motion
00:47:22 So embarrassing
00:47:25 Uh, why don't you look in the mirror?
00:47:29 No, and then move around. This is the like the highest frame rate possible
00:47:33 Yeah, I guess so
00:47:36 You go you go down looking at the the the like a body of water and you're like that sure sucks
00:47:43 It does
00:47:45 um
00:47:46 I'm I'm I'm
00:47:49 I'm like
00:47:51 I'm like I'm working on I'm doing the finale
00:47:53 I'm working on the scenes and I'm like, uh, this is cringe, but you know, I gotta do it
00:47:58 You know, I know what it's supposed to be. I know how to make it be that
00:48:03 Do I do I think that this
00:48:06 Or anything else is good or worthwhile? No, but it's no worse than anything else
00:48:13 That anyone else in the has ever done, you know, it's it's it's equally cringe
00:48:18 As everything else that that someone could be paying attention to
00:48:22 Instead so whatever
00:48:25 Just just fucking do it
00:48:27 That's all art is quite useless, but you know, what yeah, what else can I do? It's very true. That's right. That's why we
00:48:34 Do it anyways just because it makes us kind of happy even though it's also makes us sad
00:48:40 Yeah, I guess so
00:48:41 I guess I I guess I would agree my my biggest goal dream in the world
00:48:45 Is to have a character that gets a
00:48:49 Shit ton of porn drawn of it just by random people. Yeah, that's how you know you've made it
00:48:53 I want to be I want to be the toby fox but only in that one way
00:48:58 um
00:49:02 Pretty cool pretty cool. Yeah, pretty hot. Yeah
00:49:07 It's both cool. You know what else is pretty fucking hot my
00:49:11 Fucking hot and on my 3d printer. I bought it's printing something right now
00:49:17 Oh my god, really you're you're making 3d models and I haven't done that yet because I haven't I don't have a model that's like
00:49:24 Quality enough to print but I've been doing a bunch of test prints. I'm printing some model
00:49:29 I got offline right now like a little question block cart for mario
00:49:34 And it'll it'll hold switch cartridges, which is kind of cool. I just want to do that try and test like a geometric print dude
00:49:40 But uh, it's the fucking best make a
00:49:43 Make that's awesome
00:49:45 Make a fucking a zoomie
00:49:48 A mebo and and I'll buy that's the idea. I want to make stuff like that. It's gonna be fucking sick
00:49:53 I just I printed this yesterday to test out like characters
00:49:57 So I printed a bust that I found online
00:50:00 I'm putting in the chat
00:50:02 Of handsome squidward and it came out great
00:50:05 And it's fucking sick
00:50:08 I've been given power. Oh my god. That is too
00:50:12 It's too much. It's too much. I
00:50:15 The possibilities are endless. Uh, that is one of those
00:50:19 That's uh, one of those
00:50:21 Like you can see the the the lines on it still, but you know, it's pretty epic
00:50:25 Do you could would you like sand those you can sand those down?
00:50:28 There's another right now. I'm using a plastic called pla
00:50:31 Because there's different like plastic types you can use for this pla is like the easiest to use
00:50:35 But there's another one I've been reading about called abs and abs. What you can do with that is it prints out like this
00:50:40 but then if you
00:50:43 Do a
00:50:45 Acetone vapor chamber thing with it like the acetone will like smooth it out
00:50:50 So it'll look it'll get rid of those lines
00:50:53 So I'm thinking I might try doing some abs printing to make some sculptures and stuff, but like
00:50:58 It's fucking dope. And it was like it was not expensive at all
00:51:01 I got this like pretty decently large printer for like 250 bucks and it prints great and it's dope
00:51:08 Oh
00:51:09 Oh man
00:51:11 Oh, that's so cool. Okay
00:51:13 Uh, hmm
00:51:15 I wonder if I could do something with such a thing. I bet I bet you could
00:51:21 Hmm you could print gummy worms. Oh
00:51:24 I wonder I wonder if there's like one you could there's like an edible like an edible
00:51:29 Substrate you could use to like print food. I don't know if there's edible. There's flexible so you can make like springy things and stuff
00:51:37 Which I have not tried yet, but it's pretty fucking sick
00:51:40 And between this and learning sculpting. I'm gonna become ultra powerful and
00:51:46 Make all the cool things
00:51:48 It's pretty dope
00:51:50 Okay, dude. I'm impressed. I like how 3d printing has has become
00:51:54 Cheaper and and you can just get a thing. It's like pretty cool because like it's kind of changed the way I think about a lot of stuff
00:52:00 Because like now
00:52:02 Instead of like, oh, I got to go on amazon and buy something stupid
00:52:05 It's like, oh, I want to like get like a dock for my phone on my desk. I'll just print one
00:52:08 I don't have to go buy it. I'll just print it. Whatever. It's fine. You just go on on the internet get like google pixel
00:52:15 Stand and you just print it out and now you have one
00:52:16 You didn't have to do anything and like you've become a better person
00:52:20 How how long do you think before it pays for itself? Um, I mean nothing I'm doing right now really
00:52:27 is
00:52:28 Worth money. I guess like the phone thing probably would have been like 15 20 bucks, but
00:52:33 If I start making like sculptures and art with it and sell those like I'm sure probably within like
00:52:38 One or two prints that probably start like getting close to paying for itself
00:52:42 I don't know
00:52:43 Fascinating
00:52:44 Fascinating. It's pretty fucking dope. Very good
00:52:47 Damn, damn. That's neat as hell. Yeah, man
00:52:52 Trying to think what would I do with one? I feel like
00:52:55 Dilda dilda dilda. I could make a gun. Have you considered 3d printing a gun?
00:53:02 Uh, you can do that, you know, you can do that. I'm pretty sure it's illegal
00:53:06 Uh, but yeah, but you can do it anyways
00:53:09 Yeah, you know, just get a real gun and 3d print the bullets. That's not illegal when this when the civil war starts
00:53:15 I'll be ready
00:53:17 Okay, uh
00:53:20 Remember, um
00:53:22 The oh fuck what's that thing mark said something about the right to
00:53:27 Arms and ammunition party should not be infringed or whatever. Uh, no wait, that's the second amendment
00:53:33 But mark said the same thing. It's fine marky mark. Yeah
00:53:39 He said he said
00:53:41 Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated by force if necessary
00:53:48 So stick stick with it. Stick with it. Yeah
00:53:52 Uh, cool
00:53:55 Uh, we got to decentralize, uh guns and ammunition. We can make them
00:54:01 They're just you can just free to print yours at home. Amazing
00:54:05 Uh
00:54:07 Do you think
00:54:09 Do you think
00:54:10 That maybe
00:54:11 3d printing
00:54:13 Would be something that like just everyone should have do you think the world would be a better place if just like everyone had a 3d printer?
00:54:19 um
00:54:20 I think I mean it I'm trying to think of like the the uses of a 3d printer
00:54:26 aside from
00:54:28 like, um
00:54:30 I mean obviously you can get like very intricate
00:54:32 specific plastic parts for moving machines or whatever like if you're building something but like
00:54:39 Uh, I mean you can't 3d print fabric. You can't 3d print
00:54:43 like
00:54:45 Certain that you can't 3d print food
00:54:48 Seems like it's it's it's like decorative almost it's mostly useful mostly useful for useless knickknacks
00:54:54 Which is fine. I like useless knickknacks. It depends. I mean there are people who make like functional parts and stuff
00:55:02 um, I think a 3d printer would be useful in a utilitarian sense if you
00:55:08 Also learn how to make your own stuff
00:55:11 Because like you can get like fusion 360 and like model like basic
00:55:17 Uh
00:55:18 Parts and things like that like for example, like I was thinking of maybe using fusion 360 to model something to
00:55:23 better adhere
00:55:25 The uh stand to my desk that holds my second monitor
00:55:28 Uh, because right now it's kind of wobbly and like that's something that like I could buy
00:55:33 Or I could just make it and print it and like it'd be cheaper and probably quicker
00:55:37 Because it'll take like x amount of days to ship where I could probably do it in less than a day myself
00:55:42 But that requires like knowledge. So like if you're like not lazy
00:55:46 Yeah, you'd probably benefit from a 3d printer because like it'll also it also incentivizes you to like
00:55:51 solve problems that
00:55:53 You can do by yourself that maybe a
00:55:57 You would be able to buy a solution to like something very like specific that you need
00:56:01 Um, so I don't know it really depends on the person
00:56:04 I don't think everybody should have one. I think most people are lazy and dumb
00:56:07 But like if you're interested
00:56:09 I think you can find uses for it
00:56:13 Yeah, 250 bucks is just it's not that much. It's not a very high barrier to entry
00:56:18 You can get one for like 180. It's even cheaper. It's just a lot smaller
00:56:22 Jesus Jesus
00:56:24 Okay, cool
00:56:26 I feel because I'm I'm like
00:56:30 Slightly knowledgeable about 3d modeling. I've done it before
00:56:35 I've also forgotten everything and I tried again and I forgot it all again
00:56:39 um
00:56:41 So I don't I don't think I would ever like model my own things
00:56:44 I wouldn't like if I needed like a
00:56:47 Some like I don't know
00:56:50 System like some some small objects to help around
00:56:54 With my stuff like a a weird shaped thing that needs to wedge in somewhere
00:57:00 I would probably more
00:57:02 Go down the the the route of learning how to do carpentry and building things with wood and nails and stuff
00:57:09 Because I'm already
00:57:10 A little more knowledgeable in that department and I just find it cool to hold wood and to smash it with a hammer
00:57:17 Oh
00:57:21 Oh, did I did I ever mention
00:57:23 uh, my brother
00:57:26 Uh
00:57:27 Yeah, I did I last time I was saying I was gonna help my brother with stuff
00:57:32 Um, yeah, his legs been fucked up. Yeah, I have
00:57:36 Uh, since that podcast came out I went to him. I asked him if he needed help and
00:57:41 we got together because
00:57:45 Henry Henry's been um
00:57:47 Getting into upholstery
00:57:49 as like a skill
00:57:51 He went for like making couches
00:57:55 like making chairs and like traditional sort of upholstery so using like
00:58:00 proper
00:58:01 old-fashioned real materials like
00:58:04 Stuff and things and horse hair like padding. Okay. Um
00:58:09 And uh, he's had these two chairs
00:58:11 It was he's had like three or four chairs that he's been like half finished
00:58:15 But because of his leg he hasn't been able to work on them. I came in I helped him
00:58:20 and
00:58:21 it is it's got to a point where we are
00:58:25 We are building chairs and my presence in
00:58:29 In his room helping with like one of the chairs while he works on another chair
00:58:34 has got him
00:58:35 Motivated and made him feel better and it's bass as fuck
00:58:40 But also it's bass as fuck for me because I'm building a chair like a real chair would like
00:58:46 with
00:58:47 Layers to it. I don't know any of the terms, but there's this
00:58:50 That there's a thing called a harpoon needle
00:58:53 um that used to to to sew like threads all the way through the top and bottom of the chair
00:58:59 um, and then there's like these curves needles to
00:59:02 like the
00:59:03 uh
00:59:05 Really curve like if you get a mug and a needle goes all the way around the mug like a semicircle
00:59:11 that's sort of
00:59:13 A video game
00:59:14 Where you play there are games like this, but a video game where you play as a mouse
00:59:18 But you're like a warrior mouse and you have you have an rpg of swords
00:59:23 But they're all little needles
00:59:25 And like you you you get like different kinds of needles, right?
00:59:29 Like you buy oh like like I found a harpoon needle like this one's like god gives me gives me more strength
00:59:34 The smaller defense or something. Okay. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Yeah, mouse guard everybody. It's fucking sick
00:59:41 Mouse guard. Yeah, that's like literally what you're talking about
00:59:44 I feel like I'm I mean there's I have seen games where that might literally be
00:59:49 Exactly game that I follow that's doing that you might have I've retweeted
00:59:53 It's like a it's like a pixel art one. It's like behind
00:59:57 Yeah, it's like a sort of like a big like switch blade kind of thing
01:00:01 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's it. That's the one
01:00:03 Yeah, it's not a needle though. Not a needle, but that's fine. They use needles in mouse guard though, which is why I said that
01:00:10 Okay, but I think what's really cool about that give what you're talking about is like when when something that seems kind of like
01:00:17 Almost magical gets disambiguated and you understand how it's made, you know, like a chair
01:00:21 It's something that just kind of appears like you go to a store and it's there and you bring it home
01:00:25 But then like oh, this is how it's made like it's not like a magical thing
01:00:29 Like there are steps there's a process and now I know with the process
01:00:31 So when I look at chairs
01:00:33 This thing that kind of like had no context now
01:00:35 It has context and it like kind of makes you think about like everything around you
01:00:38 It's like there's a process behind all of this and like things that I don't know
01:00:42 It's like really fucking cool to like be in on the secret almost
01:00:46 It's it's really interesting because it's it's specifically old fashioned chair making techniques
01:00:51 The sort of chairs that last for hundreds of years before they break down as opposed to modern chairs
01:00:56 Which is just like a lump of foam and it breaks down after like two years
01:01:00 Like modern things in general just don't aren't built to last right so like building a chair in with this method
01:01:07 With like there's this layer of like
01:01:10 coarse
01:01:11 Like black coconut hair
01:01:14 That you're you're supposed to like scrunch like from an actual coconut
01:01:19 Yes gross I think
01:01:22 And it's like you you scrunch it around and you use like special like a
01:01:27 Um, I forget the name of it
01:01:29 It's like a a neat a thing you stab into the chair to push
01:01:33 The the the stuff around to like smooth it out and then there's like specific stitches to like hold parts in place
01:01:40 um
01:01:41 So that when you sit on the chair
01:01:44 It's like the stuffing doesn't
01:01:47 It it can't move from one side of the chair to the other like over time
01:01:52 So it's all it's in its individual little
01:01:55 Part compartments and then on top of that there's a horsehair thing and then there's a calico layer
01:02:01 And you you do half you get these little tacks these little black nails
01:02:06 And you half tack it all the way around and then you pull it really tight
01:02:11 And and then you're supposed to like while holding pulling the calico or pulling the the fabric with one hand
01:02:18 You get this special hammer that has a magnet on one side and you're supposed to like put the nail the tack on the hammer
01:02:24 Hold the the the material really tight and then like whack the nail into the fabric into the wood
01:02:30 and then uh
01:02:31 Then it holds it because it's really sharp
01:02:34 And it's like all these little processes to go to make a chair that just uh, you see and you're like, oh, it's a chair
01:02:40 It's got a it's got padding
01:02:42 You see like all these things that go on in these old chairs is really interesting
01:02:46 uh
01:02:47 Learn making making gummies has has not demestified demystified it at all. It has remystified it
01:02:54 I am continually surprised and terrified
01:02:59 by how
01:03:00 they come out
01:03:01 So different every time like I made some the other day and they came out. They were completely solid
01:03:08 They were they just came out as completely solid like hard
01:03:11 Hard candy, which is not what I wanted. It was inedible
01:03:15 Uh, uh, it sucked and and then I used the same recipe the next day and they didn't
01:03:21 Uh, I think the difference is that I just I cooked the first one longer like I cooked more of the water out of it or something
01:03:28 um
01:03:29 It's like yeah, there's so many fucking variables and I can't
01:03:34 Cooking I've been trying I've been introducing new ingredients like I've I've I've switched from using
01:03:39 I pretty much figured out how to do it with beef gelatin, but I don't want to use that anymore
01:03:43 I want to try using pectin and agar agar and uh and carrageenan
01:03:49 Um and rice flour, but I keep I don't know. I'll fucking throw these things all together and it'll it'll it always comes out weird
01:03:57 But a different kind of weird
01:04:00 It's always wrong, but in like it's it's wrong in new and novel ways every time
01:04:05 Baking is a mystery
01:04:07 It's it's neat I guess
01:04:10 Uh, I like the ones that are passion fruit flavor passion fruit's the best flavor. I make them blue usually
01:04:20 uh
01:04:21 That's a fact jack
01:04:23 I've tried making keto brownies three times now and each time they've come out completely different despite me doing
01:04:28 The exact same thing and I don't understand
01:04:31 Is very damn it's are you doing keto tom? Um, yeah, I usually have one off day a week
01:04:37 Uh, yeah, most part i'm sticking to it
01:04:39 And uh, yeah, I found this like keto brownie recipe. That's just like
01:04:44 almond flour
01:04:46 uh
01:04:47 Sweetener cocoa and protein powder and then like a can of diet coke and it makes brownies really. Yeah, it's it's like diet coke
01:04:55 That's very weird. It's very strange, but it works
01:04:59 I just can't get it to be consistent despite doing the exact same thing. Uh, that's baking for you
01:05:04 Yeah, that's that's yeah some things
01:05:07 I mean, that's why the factories have like such uh rigorously controlled environments if the humidity or the temperature is different
01:05:15 Everything could change
01:05:17 With some with certain recipes
01:05:19 So like they keep it exactly the same and then they just production line makes the same thing every time
01:05:26 You should need a factory bench need to buy a factory. I I would love I would love to I would love to do that. Um
01:05:34 I've been thinking they'd be really funny if you know
01:05:38 When uh when covet is gone lamal and we do another uh rowdy fuckers con killers
01:05:44 if um
01:05:45 If I just made a big like bucket of keto slime
01:05:49 And I was like hey and like we just could just like ladle it out to people. It's like put it on a plate
01:05:54 I could do it. It'd be easy
01:05:56 Uh, just be it would just make like a make a big a big bowl of what I would turn into gummy worms
01:06:02 But then just not put it in the molds
01:06:04 and uh
01:06:05 That could just be what everyone eats the whole time. You're not allowed to eat anything else actually
01:06:11 Uh forced keto. Yes. Yes
01:06:15 Uh, I just think that would be funny and it would taste good. I would make it I would make it like mango flavor or something
01:06:23 Sour apple flavor
01:06:25 You know, I have an apple. I have an apple flavoring and I don't like it
01:06:29 I don't like the apple and I don't like the pear which is weird because usually I really like both of those
01:06:34 But this brand or whatever
01:06:36 This company that I guess I've been buying my flavorings from they just don't do it good. They don't have
01:06:42 Good apple pear. They suck. They're bad
01:06:45 But their mango and passion fruit is very good. Mwah
01:06:49 Delightful. I made uh, I made some orange
01:06:52 I tried to make some orange yesterday and I used the pectin
01:06:56 And I used carrageenan and I used rice flour and it came out so stiff that I could not put it into molds
01:07:02 So I just spread it on a piece of like
01:07:05 aluminum foil
01:07:06 Uh and put it in the aluminum foil in the fridge and now I just have like sort of a brick
01:07:11 Of this orange paste that is now completely hardened. It sort of has a consistency like fruit leather
01:07:16 um
01:07:18 And next to that is a little jar full of it's actually the same gummies that I I posted a picture of them on twitter
01:07:25 And I guess it started a little bit of an insurrection in rfck. I guess the killers are revolting against me now
01:07:31 Uh, there's some, you know, there's some there's some some pretty uh, uh, what's the word?
01:07:36 There's some propaganda going around. There's a little bit of a revolutionary overtones. That's fine
01:07:42 Uh, but I still have those but they're in a jar, but like they've hardened
01:07:47 So much they're like candles. They're like they're like they're like wax now
01:07:51 um, and and I
01:07:54 They weren't like that before but I guess you should use them like candles
01:07:58 I wonder
01:07:59 I wonder
01:08:01 Addable addable candles. That's that's where this is going. That's where this journey ends
01:08:07 Edible slime candles slime candles that have a green flame at the end
01:08:11 Those ones didn't even come out that good. Those were apple flavored
01:08:14 I tried to make them green apple, but they didn't flavor them enough and the apple's not very good anyway
01:08:19 and uh
01:08:20 They're they're they're really hard and waxy and I don't know. I don't know man. I don't know
01:08:27 That's it's uh, it's a mystery
01:08:29 It's complete complete chaos
01:08:32 In the ben saint kitchen these days
01:08:36 Uh, yeah
01:08:40 So I got to say about that we're at an hour, uh, if you guys are
01:08:45 One we could go on to voicemails unless there's anything else you want to talk about
01:08:49 I got one last thing. Yeah, um, wouldn't be very long. I just want to ask you two because you're old than me whether this happened to you
01:08:57 um
01:08:58 It's my birthday in two days as of the recording of this
01:09:03 Yeah, and uh, I
01:09:05 I don't remember if I'm already 27 or if I'm gonna be 28 or 29
01:09:12 I don't I don't remember
01:09:14 I thought you were like I thought you were like 25
01:09:17 No, no, no, I'm at least 26, but I don't remember further than that. I I've completely lost track
01:09:24 I could easily add up the numbers, but it's like yeah, like late 20s
01:09:28 I stopped caring, but when I when I was about to hit 30
01:09:32 I was deathly aware and I felt very terrible and now every year past 30. I've just like
01:09:39 Oh god, I'm not even I don't even like why even be alive anymore. It doesn't even matter. Nothing I do
01:09:45 Is is worth anything?
01:09:49 No, I I'm with you because I'm actually I think I'm 32
01:09:54 But I might be 31
01:09:57 Uh
01:09:59 Wait, no, hold wait, you'll be turning 32 right because you're only a couple months older me. I'll be 32 in november. So
01:10:07 You're wait, you're turning 32 in november correct then I would have then I would have turned wait no
01:10:13 I was born in 90. I was born in 88 and it's 2020 now
01:10:18 So so like I was I turned zero in in in 88 and I turned two

01:10:53 Uh, I am with you. Yes. Yes. Yes. It happened changed. Yeah, I mean it means less and less
01:11:01 What's what's even the difference?
01:11:03 What's even the difference between like 25 and like 40?
01:11:08 15 years
01:11:12 Anyway, I gotta go to the hospital now
01:11:17 Yeah, what is old age?
01:11:21 Ah man, oh man
01:11:26 I we could go to questions. I guess, you know, we got nothing else. It's a little bit of it's a little bit of a relief
01:11:32 Honestly, it was a little bit of a relief to have quarantine happening when I had my birthday this year
01:11:38 Because it meant we didn't have to do anything
01:11:41 which is just kind of like
01:11:43 cool
01:11:44 like, yeah, I don't
01:11:45 Don't care that much. I don't care about celebrating my birthday too much
01:11:49 I think I think we did like all hang out or what are like some people in my house all did a thing
01:11:53 but we didn't like
01:11:54 You know ordinarily, maybe I would have like
01:11:57 Had people over or something and I didn't have to do any of that
01:12:01 You know, like I like doing stuff, but I don't like doing
01:12:05 birthday stuff
01:12:06 It's annoying
01:12:08 Happy birthday to you
01:12:10 Me to you
01:12:12 Wow, this video is copyright claim. Oh wait, it's not even on youtube lamau. We don't have to worry about that anymore
01:12:19 I love dude. I can say sponge bob square pants now. I can say that
01:12:25 No character
01:12:28 Let me you know, let me complain. Let me complain about something
01:12:32 Uh
01:12:34 What do you guys think? I think
01:12:37 That jenna marbles was not cancelled and anyone that thinks she's been cancelled is fucking stupid
01:12:42 I know nothing about this
01:12:47 All right, well, I know that on twitter cancel culture
01:12:50 Is is is all the rage these days everyone's complaining about it and I guess it's it's almost entirely on twitter only
01:12:57 I don't know if it has any effect
01:13:00 Okay. Well, jenna. Well, well jenna marbles got quote unquote cancelled
01:13:04 Which basically just means that somebody was like, hey guys jenna marbles did blackface once jenna marbles was like, oh
01:13:12 It's true. I did I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry
01:13:16 Everyone was like, wow, what a gracious apology. You know, she's really handling this the way more people we more people should
01:13:23 And then jenna was like, hey guys, I have decided of my own volition
01:13:27 to not
01:13:28 Uh upload more videos to youtube and everyone said, oh my god
01:13:33 jenna marbles was cancelled the cancel mob got her
01:13:37 And like they fucking didn't I don't know it makes me really mad
01:13:40 It makes me really mad that someone could see that and be like, oh
01:13:43 How could that how could this have happened? She's such she's been victimized by uh by an irrational mob mentality
01:13:51 That is just cancelling people left and right. She's the latest victim
01:13:55 Like no, she had a pr kerfuffle
01:13:58 And then this is how she chose to handle it. Like that's
01:14:02 Like what what what do you want? Like what what else what should have happened?
01:14:06 That's what I don't understand. I don't understand the mentality here
01:14:10 She should have doubled down and just done more blackface. I mean that's the obvious she should have said it was representation
01:14:17 Yeah, obviously
01:14:21 She should have become completely blackface from then on
01:14:25 Ah
01:14:27 Let's talk about
01:14:29 net netflix pulls netflix pulls the episode of community where the chinese guy
01:14:36 Uh, uh
01:14:37 Where is black makeup because he's played he's a drow in d&d
01:14:41 Uh stupid uh brand stupid
01:14:44 Uh, uh, uh simpsons is like we're not gonna have white people play black people anymore. Uh, whatever nobody cares
01:14:52 Uh, I hate I hate everything
01:14:54 Uh, I hate
01:14:56 I hate culture. I hate society. I hate living in a society. I have become joker-fied
01:15:03 um
01:15:05 I don't know that's that's my june
01:15:07 There you go
01:15:09 Yeah
01:15:10 Well, yeah, I I've I've been I've been
01:15:13 Not paying attention to twitter because I blocked it on based in the same way. I block youtube
01:15:19 I may have mentioned that already uh last time but
01:15:22 um
01:15:23 Blocking it in the same way that I can only look at it during the weekend
01:15:27 Which is right now, but I also haven't felt the need to because like
01:15:31 Like I check twitter every day. I used to check twitter every day
01:15:34 I check what people I'm following and then I check a bunch of people that I like assume would have something they're talking about
01:15:42 um
01:15:42 Like just by searching their name
01:15:44 And I look at what they're saying and I'm like I go on twitter and I feel worse than I was when I first got on there
01:15:49 Yeah
01:15:50 And it's like just it's it's like it's the same thing every time
01:15:54 um, but by reducing the amount of times I do it
01:15:58 I just care less I'm like like if I do it every day or every five minutes
01:16:02 I'm gonna care a lot, but if I do it once a week. I I don't know
01:16:06 I've been seriously considering just like
01:16:09 Becoming a new person online and just scrubbing everything
01:16:14 Just why don't it's it's I I like the idea, but I also
01:16:19 Feel like it's so
01:16:20 Impossible what what what would be the point? I don't I don't really even know what the point would be
01:16:25 It's just it's just a temptation that
01:16:29 Lacks any sort of like cohesive reasoning. I just feel like I want to go away sometimes
01:16:35 uh
01:16:35 Yeah, sometimes I feel like
01:16:38 By by having
01:16:40 Information out there at any point
01:16:42 Um, I'm now like damaged goods and I can't now exist as a new mysterious person anywhere
01:16:50 Unless I hide my
01:16:52 voice or face
01:16:55 Like eventually people will connect the dogs and find everything that I've ever said and it's like well, I'm whatever
01:17:02 Can't do anything about it. I guess
01:17:04 yeah
01:17:07 If you went away for like years and then you came back and did something like completely unrelated to what you're doing now
01:17:14 Even if people discover like oh, this guy used to be on a podcast or whatever this guy used to have another youtube channel
01:17:20 uh, uh, uh, I feel like
01:17:23 I feel like it is possible to create like
01:17:25 enough distance between like your current self and your past self and it's like oh, well, that's like
01:17:30 Sure, that's like technically the same person, but like it's not like you know part of the same
01:17:35 like like, um
01:17:37 I don't know
01:17:39 It's funny. I just remembered that there have been people who
01:17:44 Like watched t-bap and both yours and Nate's content and had no idea you two were those guys
01:17:53 That's so funny
01:17:55 Like who like didn't even know like, uh
01:17:59 Uh, if I can jesse
01:18:01 Uh, endless jess was also my japanese anime. They thought it was they were two different people. I was like how
01:18:08 That's so that's so wild
01:18:11 Yeah, I always just assume that anyone who's seen
01:18:14 My stuff like found it through
01:18:17 My other stuff
01:18:19 right
01:18:20 I don't I don't imagine like
01:18:22 A new
01:18:23 Like I don't imagine the stuff that I put online like reaching a new audience
01:18:27 I kind of just always assume that it's just going to be seen by all the same people who've seen everything else
01:18:31 I've ever put there
01:18:33 Uh, Lamal
01:18:35 I guess it's not always true. Sometimes it leaks out into the wider world a little bit
01:18:41 Everybody everybody finds you
01:18:43 Through a different thing
01:18:45 Hmm. Hmm. Very wise very wise
01:18:49 Uh
01:18:52 I don't know
01:18:54 Very is really funny that uh
01:18:57 I'm imagine imagine having watched tbap and then watching like stumbling across the pcp
01:19:04 And not knowing that it's the same guy. That's so wild
01:19:08 I don't know
01:19:10 You guys there or what? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Nothing to say about it. Well. Yeah, please. You're leaving me hanging
01:19:16 I'm dying here. I mean, yeah, you know, I agree. I agree. Let's go to voicemails. Let's go to fucking voicemails. Yeah, no more of this

01:20:19 I feel like that's solid advice regardless of the context keep your flags presentable if you want to raise them high and let them be seen
01:20:29 Have some pride in your pride flag
01:20:31 Listen, listen, I'm I'm not a cop. I'm not gonna tell you that you can't wave around
01:20:38 That you that you can't wave around a dirty ragged, you know crumpled up pride flag if if you want to
01:20:45 But you know
01:20:46 Can consider consider how best to spread your intended message. It's not illegal, but it's not really ethical either
01:20:55 Is it not ethical to I think it's it's it's the better choice to
01:21:00 Have it be presentable. You can do it just because you can doesn't mean you should
01:21:04 The I mean, you know when when a flag touches the ground, you're supposed to burn it
01:21:09 So I so I propose gentlemen
01:21:12 That in a display of solidarity to our lgbt qia plus allies, we all take to the streets and burn pride flags
01:21:20 In a demonstration to show just how seriously we take I feel I feel as if you might have missed the mark a bit on that one
01:21:28 No, no, no, no. No, this is good. It's good. That's called patriotism
01:21:32 We are the true patriots. You're more educated on this than me. So I'll defer to your expertise. That's right
01:21:37 That's correct. This is not a pride flags. This is flag pride
01:21:44 Uh, wait, did you say fag?
01:21:49 That's what I heard. That's what I heard. I'm sorry
01:21:52 I heard it. I heard it. You know what you want to hear. I think
01:21:56 No, no, no, no. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Um, all right. Let's move on to the next one. Let's move on
01:22:03 No, no more of this. Okay. This is from
01:22:06 Trapped in my room and there is a youtube link attached
01:22:10 three two one go
01:22:13 I missed the old rad con the comic gold rad con the bread stole rad con and now there's no rad con
01:22:19 I hate the new rad con since Nate's screwed with rad con his channel's got hacked and now he's ruined rad con
01:22:25 I missed the fans rad con the 30 grand rad con people might even say i'm better than rad con
01:22:31 So you had to grow with rad con. I made my own rad con since impossible now to even be shown rad con
01:22:37 I used to love rad con. I used to love rad con. I even made my own lecture
01:22:42 I thought I was rad con what if a fan who once was a slave to rad con
01:22:46 Stole a Kanye song just to promote his own channel so he can save rad con
01:22:50 That's all it was rad con. We still love rad con. They stole you like brad stole brad con
01:22:57 Uh
01:23:00 Cool, so this good good good flow good beats
01:23:06 um
01:23:07 This guy so this this link that he he has here goes to
01:23:12 a a lecture
01:23:14 Kanye it's called Kanye name one genius that ain't crazy a pcp inspired lecture
01:23:21 I
01:23:22 I feel like maybe
01:23:24 Okay, I think recently someone added the pcp on twitter
01:23:29 With a lecture and I think maybe this was the same one
01:23:33 Uh, so this is another we've got I guess this is only like the second
01:23:38 Like like pcp style lecture i've seen i've seen tectonic improv's one about linkara and I guess this one now which is about Kanye
01:23:46 Uh, I don't know. I'll I'll give it a watch
01:23:50 Lincoln Lincoln the doobly-doo
01:23:53 Uh, let's go check out, uh
01:23:55 Yeah, he's trapped in my room on on youtube. He's got a fucking it's two hours two and a half hours

01:24:36 It did originate from vlogbrothers. Yeah, it was like I've started
01:24:39 I was he started he was saying it on his older videos
01:24:41 I'm like, oh, this is like his older videos before like he realized it was a retarded thing to say
01:24:46 But some of his newer videos he still says it. I'm like
01:24:49 Oh, you know brand recognition old habits old habits diehard. I guess I just it just
01:24:56 What if you copyrighted hey guys
01:24:59 Oh
01:25:00 No, there's an idea. There's an idea. You know, we got a copyright. Sorry. We got a copyright. Sorry. I haven't made a video in a while

01:25:13 Yeah, we absolutely
01:25:15 Wait, it's in the the front. No the front of the shirt should say hey guys and the back should say sorry
01:25:20 I haven't made a video in a while. Yeah. Yeah, I don't I don't see why not
01:25:25 Uh, okay. Well, that's that's next
01:25:29 On the pipeline. Uh, next one next voicemail
01:25:33 Uh persona this one is called persona five is too difficult on normal
01:25:38 By the way, I have not curated any of these
01:25:41 So we're just we're just going in completely raw. So this one's two two voicemails along so three two one go
01:25:50 Finally fucking did the persona. I beat the the the the thing that I was talking about and I killed the penis head monster
01:25:57 Uh, the game is finally good again
01:26:00 yippie
01:26:02 Have you guys played persona?
01:26:04 Never
01:26:05 No, okay neither of us not even I don't even care
01:26:09 Yeah, you're right. Actually, uh, the next one is called persona five. I did it. Uh
01:26:15 Maybe he did it. Okay. I guess he did it. Congratulations, sir
01:26:20 Uh, great. Uh, all right the next one. Uh, the next voicemail is titled your white
01:26:27 And not you are why you are your why you are white
01:26:32 So, uh, let's fucking get it
01:26:35 gentlemen
01:26:36 All right, three two one go
01:26:40 Hello, Nate. This is, uh
01:26:43 Well, you already know who this is
01:26:45 Um, I've heard I listened to the last podcast episode and I did not read or
01:26:52 Played
01:26:54 Still want to hear my voicemail to be played. Um, Nate. What's your opinion about the BLM?
01:27:00 BLM movement
01:27:02 And I want to actually if you don't mind be on the show discuss why
01:27:07 Dispree with a lot of your opinions and how it's contradictory that you want a star trek future, but you do not advocate for the
01:27:16 Uplifting of any other ethnic community
01:27:20 Um, so that's kind of weird
01:27:22 So and your alter in your belief system of doing the most good
01:27:28 Is contradictory of your actions. So again, just just want to know
01:27:33 Nate like if I want to see if you actually uphold the standards or you're just putting on errors, dude
01:27:40 All right, so all right
01:27:43 Yeah, again, this is
01:27:45 Oh, this is uh, you're white. That's that's why I put in the last title or whatever. So again
01:27:52 I want to hear your opinion and thoughts about it. Okay. Bye. I don't remember this guy's previous voicemail
01:28:00 Do you guys remember I didn't I remember I think you were by yourself when you did that
01:28:05 Uh, I don't or maybe not. I don't know
01:28:13 Did I not I don't know okay doesn't ring a bell whatever I don't know Nate's not even here
01:28:19 Uh, I agree the Nate is cringe. I don't know any of Nate's opinions on this and I don't want to
01:28:24 Uh, Nate just doesn't talk about it, which is cringe. Very cringe. I see. I see. He doesn't want to talk politics
01:28:31 I don't want to talk politics. Uh, you gotta be gotta be neutral on everything. That's how that's how you do the most good
01:28:38 In with stuff. Okay, whatever
01:28:41 Uh, thanks for your call your white. Mr. Mr. White
01:28:45 um
01:28:47 Shall we next one is from
01:28:50 PAP endorses mining at night
01:28:53 Uh
01:28:54 Three two one go
01:28:57 Hey, pcp. I have a very spicy one for you guys. So the procrastinator's anonymous
01:29:05 Fully endorses mining at night. Now. I know what you're thinking. It's a very controversial take, but
01:29:12 It's actually better
01:29:14 I mean, hey, you want the least amount of mobs to spawn as possible to interrupt your mining. Am I not correct?
01:29:23 Thus you do need to mine at night because more mobs will spawn on the surface
01:29:29 And less will spawn in the caves where you will do your mining
01:29:34 I don't know whether that's true
01:29:36 I guess it depends on if you're close enough to the surface that they can spawn up there or if you're on a multiplayer server
01:29:43 He's okay. So he's saying that because mob spawn in the darkness and there's a limited number of mob spawns
01:29:50 If you're mining at night, they'll be spawning on the surface and that'll reduce the spawns you
01:29:56 Yeah, okay
01:29:58 It makes sense
01:29:59 It might be true. I don't know
01:30:02 I don't play minecraft. Well, to see the thing is
01:30:06 Uh, it's it's not don't mine at night because it's better to not mine night
01:30:11 It's we're just telling you to do that. You have to do it if you don't if you disobey you will be
01:30:17 um
01:30:17 Scoot, yeah, it's it's not. Yeah, it's not it's not worse because anything in the game
01:30:22 It's worse because we'll kill you we'll destroy you you dare. Yeah. Yeah, how you dare
01:30:30 He does the the the the the pro the procrastinating the the pro and on cast
01:30:36 Is that what they're called? What are they called the procrastinator's anonymous cat pro and on?
01:30:40 Yeah, one of those pro and on they they all right they endorse this dangerous ideology
01:30:46 It's cringe. Uh, uh, it does not it does not reduce harm
01:30:50 Uh, it is it is uh, it needs to be canceled get on twitter
01:30:55 A hashtag cancel the path. Uh, that's that's that's that's what's up
01:31:00 All right, third next one
01:31:02 Next one
01:31:04 Is titled with a a bitly link and the link is to his discord screenshot of michelle
01:31:10 Saying oh wait, shan. Are you the voicemail god?
01:31:14 uh, okay
01:31:16 But here we go. Well three two one now
01:31:18 Ellie is our please link this in the show notes. This is that feel when you're late to the joke
01:31:26 Okay, terrible
01:31:29 Voice jail
01:31:31 We didn't we didn't successfully abolish voice jail. No, we still have an iron grip on a few people
01:31:38 Fuck yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's still there. You know the terror the terror continues
01:31:43 So, uh, you know watch yourself. All right next one is from vox populi
01:31:50 Uh three two one go
01:31:52 Since this is apparently some sort of art help podcast. How the fuck do I finish long projects short project get inspired do thing
01:32:01 Finish thing long project get inspired do thing have issue no inspiration to get over issue never finish thing
01:32:10 What the fuck can you even do?
01:32:17 Uh, yeah, long project is just small project, but uh, but many of them in a long in a long line
01:32:25 Yeah
01:32:26 Yeah, break it break it down. You just gotta into manageable chunks. You gotta not rely on the inspiration
01:32:32 You have to discipline yourself and not be a bitch
01:32:34 Uh, I had that's also true. I had a fucking twitter post where I I made this really long image of
01:32:41 me explaining
01:32:43 The two methods of of creation
01:32:46 Uh, I don't want to get into it because it's really long-winded, but
01:32:50 I could link that because that it was like it was good. I remember that
01:32:53 yeah the thing with
01:32:55 Doing things and then creating things
01:32:58 Two sides of the brain two different methods if you're if you're liking inspiration
01:33:03 Um, it's because you don't have a plan of what to do and for that I would say so the solution is just to experience things you like
01:33:11 That's what I'm doing. It's working. I'm what if you don't but what if you don't like anything?
01:33:16 Then look at things people say is good and just be optimistic about it
01:33:21 Ugh
01:33:23 No, just like assume that you are correctly stupid and you don't know anything is like go to people say
01:33:29 What do I do? What do I what's good?
01:33:31 And they say a big big list because they always have a big list everyone has a big list of things that you should watch read and
01:33:36 Listen to and you're like, okay. I'll do that. I'll do that. You put one into your vhs
01:33:43 And you watch it
01:33:44 And you're like, okay. I don't know if I gained anything but I I did it
01:33:49 And you do that over and over again, eventually you'll become smart like me
01:33:53 This is like kind of sad almost but something that like does inspire me is like watching bad things
01:34:00 Uh, because a lot of the times I'll get down on myself back. Oh my god
01:34:02 This is the worst thing ever made by human and then I'll watch like an episode of best of the worst
01:34:06 I'll be like, oh my god. I'm fine. I'm totally fine. Oh, definitely. It could be it could be so much worse
01:34:12 Oh, I'm I'm a fucking genius. I'm and then I feel better have I mentioned the Tezuka awards
01:34:19 Submission page has like a thing where you can look at all of the submissions
01:34:24 And there are so many of them already and they are awful. I mean
01:34:29 These are the ones that I'm I'm talking about. I were posted like days after the contest was announced
01:34:34 So they could not have been a lot of effort put in
01:34:37 um
01:34:38 They are the worst things I've ever seen. They are extremely cringe. I look at them and I'm like, wow
01:34:43 I'll be fine. Wait
01:34:45 These are like other entries other entries into the contest. Yes
01:34:48 Where can I find them? I want to see um, I'll get a link
01:34:53 In a yeah
01:34:55 I want to see the cringe. Are they all
01:34:57 How many of the entries are from japanese people? I don't know
01:35:03 Hmm
01:35:07 There's a there's a there's a place to see it
01:35:12 Uh
01:35:13 Guys, I just got a message
01:35:16 from munchy
01:35:17 Jay trump telling me that the vaporette is done. Oh, that's good. Five. That's five unless he's lying unless this is a prank
01:35:26 That's five out of six
01:35:29 So there we go. Oh, this is happening live. This is happening live on the air
01:35:35 unscripted
01:35:35 So we all have to bully jade morrow now. Is that what you're saying? We all have to bully jade morrow. That's right
01:35:41 jade
01:35:45 I think she might I think she might be on like a trip or something
01:35:48 I think she she said she was going somewhere and I'm not sure if she's back yet
01:35:52 That's still her fault for going on a trip
01:35:55 That's true. No, it's true. She was getting off the bus and I held my leg out and says have a nice trip when she fell
01:36:03 And she's still falling. She's been falling for ages
01:36:09 Take a picture of the last longer
01:36:13 Cool
01:36:14 Um
01:36:15 Can you show me these man show me the manga. I posted the link. Show me the manga
01:36:21 Where is the manga? There's definitely some some more good ones that have been submitted since I last looked
01:36:27 But there's there's definitely the
01:36:31 There's definitely the ones I mean
01:36:33 There was one that was like popular for a while called two piece, which was just
01:36:38 Like a terribly drunk number two piece
01:36:41 Yeah, that's
01:36:42 And uh, oh, yeah, some of these are like real bad
01:36:46 Yeah, I mean, no, it's it's a it's a very exciting process. Yeah, I do
01:36:52 Tails gets trolled is on here. Wait, no
01:36:55 No, it's on page two
01:36:59 What there are pages at the bottom
01:37:03 Oh, okay
01:37:04 Tails gets trolled by chris pool. Is that his name?
01:37:08 What the fuck it could be his name
01:37:12 No, it can't be
01:37:15 This can't be this has to be some kind of like troll entry
01:37:18 It has to be right
01:37:19 I mean, I hope it's the real deal if if he thinks he could he could like submit tails gets trolled as a comic
01:37:25 To the is a troll. It would be a troll move to submit tails gets trolled
01:37:30 Yeah, it would
01:37:32 Oh, these are like not even very long. This one's only this one's only 10 pages. There's two piece
01:37:40 This one is
01:37:42 Oh, no, it's not it's not by lezabot. It just says please go support lezabot. Fuck you, dude
01:37:46 Post this on his behalf. You're probably
01:37:49 That sucks. What if it wins, huh? What are you gonna do then?
01:37:53 um
01:37:54 what about
01:37:56 How wait, how oh, okay, this one's 54 pages
01:38:01 I was gonna say like these all seem really short, but some of them are long some of them. Um, it's
01:38:07 What one of these days? How long is yours gonna be? No idea. I'm thinking between 30 and 50 pages
01:38:14 It's respectable
01:38:16 healthy
01:38:18 Because like, um
01:38:19 The wanted by it sure odor was 30 pages
01:38:23 I was looking at some other ones the the won the tesaka awards
01:38:26 They're more closer to 50 55 pages and the limit is 55
01:38:31 So I'm thinking somewhere in that ballpark is like the the the right amount for it to be
01:38:36 concise
01:38:37 Yet contain a lot of stuff and have it
01:38:40 And I'll have it all work
01:38:43 so
01:38:44 Are these all the submissions? I
01:38:47 Oh, you can change by language. Let's there's not actually that many
01:38:52 These are the english ones if the at the top
01:38:55 Right, so you can I guess you can't see the japanese ones. You can see the korean ones
01:39:00 There's only a few of those
01:39:02 Spanish why can't I why can't I see the japanese ones because those are the best ones
01:39:06 Those are the ones that are actually going to win
01:39:09 There's a lot of spanish ones
01:39:11 and they they seem to be
01:39:13 Generally better overall like i'm seeing a pretty few actually good-looking ones
01:39:19 But then also, yeah
01:39:21 There are exactly five there are five korean ones
01:39:25 It is funny till I mean we still got two whole months before the deadline
01:39:28 I'm sure there's going to be a huge spike near the end if you had two more months to work on this
01:39:32 Why would you submit it like I would be like busting my ass like it's it's cuz people
01:39:38 I mean these ones they don't look
01:39:41 Either they were already drawn or they're very fast at drawing or
01:39:45 Like the the ones that look bad. They don't realize that
01:39:49 You need to spend more time on a drawing to make it good
01:39:53 And they just wanted it to be done like I I got school
01:39:55 I should I should I got like a few minutes after school. Maybe this is like an advertising thing
01:39:59 They're not trying to win the contest
01:40:01 They just know that they're going to be on the front page of something a lot of people are going on
01:40:04 And they're hoping to pick up traffic that way
01:40:06 I mean there is like a voting system people can like things and view things
01:40:10 So it's true
01:40:12 Some of these things that look not so good have got a couple thousand looks
01:40:18 Do you think do you think do you think jump regrets their decision yet of opening this up to everybody?
01:40:25 I I
01:40:27 I don't know
01:40:28 I don't think so because
01:40:31 There's got to be lots of of young japanese kids who are like
01:40:36 Generally japanese people seem to be better at drawing
01:40:39 That's not that's that cannot be like all people in japan are better at drawing
01:40:44 There's got to be a few that just don't get it don't know how to do it don't unskilled don't want to work
01:40:50 But they want to win anyway, so they're gonna submit so I don't think this is like unusual
01:40:55 That's fair
01:40:57 What if I like went and just like submitted the champion to this like even though it's old
01:41:04 You could do that. Yeah
01:41:07 You couldn't put the you couldn't put the game in there, but uh, how am I how many pages is the first chapter?
01:41:13 Uh
01:41:14 I I forget hold on let me find out
01:41:18 Uh maximum page limit is 55. I I guess for it to be like a good entry
01:41:24 It would need to be a contained story that has a beginning and an end
01:41:27 It's 60. It's 67 pages. Ah fail lull. It's there's an epic fail
01:41:33 Lot of ghosts is nearly 100 pages, so I couldn't submit that I'll just cut out like I'll just cut out like some some bad ones
01:41:42 Cut out the the first page second page
01:41:47 Who needs them?
01:41:49 Uh
01:41:51 Oh, yeah, I can cut out the well if I cut out the cover
01:41:55 Maybe yeah, I don't know whatever who cares
01:41:59 Uh, all right, what were we talking about? We were talking about laughing at people who are not good in order to feel better about ourselves, which I do
01:42:07 um
01:42:08 It's not for me. It's not so even so much laughing. It's just like
01:42:12 Because like so much of the time you look at it's a relief and you see great artists and you're like, oh god
01:42:18 I'm nowhere near that but then you like it's the other side of the spectrum be like, okay. It's not it's not as bad
01:42:24 It's there are no there are no great artists every time I see art. I think man. This this is shit
01:42:30 This is embarrassing. That's not me at all
01:42:32 But I guess that means I shouldn't be embarrassed because even the good stuff sucks
01:42:37 Like the the thing yeah, it's not laughter. I don't I'm not laughing at these people. It's it's more of a
01:42:44 a relief and like a
01:42:46 That that people who have nowhere near the level of skill even I have
01:42:52 Are confident enough in themselves to submit
01:42:55 Their work and I'm like wow. Why am I being a coward when these people
01:43:00 Are able to step up to the plate and present something to the world
01:43:05 So it's like it's it's a relief that I don't have to worry so much
01:43:09 Yeah
01:43:10 Yeah, I feel you I feel you on that being an artist is embarrassing
01:43:14 Being an artist is just like embarrassing yourself
01:43:17 For money. It's it's cringe and based at the same time. It's one of those. Yeah. Yeah, pretty much
01:43:23 I guess I guess so
01:43:26 Uh, do you want to do the last voicemail?
01:43:28 Yeah
01:43:29 Okay, this last one is from
01:43:31 We got one from this person last time. This is from margar. So three two one go
01:43:39 Hey, the pcp
01:43:40 I've just been listening to the latest episode and I can't help but wonder why there are so few you
01:43:48 Showing up. It seems like lately. It's really just been ben
01:43:51 uh, hippo and
01:43:53 Nate but
01:43:55 Isn't there a financial incentive for more people to show up?
01:43:59 I mean, it just doesn't really make sense to me like
01:44:03 What else could you guys all be doing that more people can't show up for the episodes?
01:44:07 I'll listen to them either way. I think this just seems a little weird to me
01:44:13 I said the same thing. I also don't understand it. There is
01:44:18 There is an incentive. Yeah. I mean, that's how you get paid is if you show up to episodes
01:44:22 Well, I can explain why I haven't been here
01:44:25 Yeah, I mean I've been busy with like studying and stuff
01:44:29 But the the real reason is that I have the covet unemployment thing
01:44:34 and yeah, uh
01:44:35 If I am on all four
01:44:38 Episodes a month and then I get paid from Nate
01:44:41 I am not qualified to collect unemployment and I make double the amount of money
01:44:45 For unemployment than I do being on the podcast
01:44:47 So it is actually my financial incentive now is to not be on the show because I make 500 extra dollars
01:44:54 Can't you just thanks covet? Thanks covet. Can't you just like split up the amount like
01:45:00 Between weeks and then you're still under the limit. I'm splitting up my patreon right now
01:45:05 Between the weeks
01:45:07 But I don't know because like if you if I go over 267 dollars in one of those weeks
01:45:11 You get kicked and I don't get anything
01:45:14 So I I'd have to crunch the numbers and like figure it out because even if you make like 250 something dollars
01:45:20 You still get like 20 percent docked from the mouth. So yeah, it's yeah
01:45:26 It's a it's a financial juggling. It's a lot of math. I don't like math
01:45:29 So the easiest way is like I can spend that three hours doing more studying which I want to do anyways
01:45:35 And I know I make more money. So I I also I do I do get money docked off my
01:45:41 My unemployment for for like making income at all, which is funny
01:45:47 uh, but
01:45:49 But people got to be on the podcast
01:45:51 Yeah, somebody's got to be on the after you guys a bone this week. I was like, I fuck it. I'm right here
01:45:56 Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure
01:45:59 um
01:46:00 I mean
01:46:01 You can always just ask Nate to like hold off on paying you, right? I suppose
01:46:06 Yeah, um, I mean it ends like in like three or four weeks. Anyways, so it won't be an issue after that
01:46:14 It uh, they might extend it but like less like it might go from like the like 600
01:46:19 Bonus to like they might like cut it a half down to like a 300 bonus or something. Well, I'm okay. It's not
01:46:25 It's not it's not clear what they're gonna what's gonna happen
01:46:28 I'm gaining back all the savings I lost when I was fucking pre-surgery. So I'm about it
01:46:33 The state is uh, helping me out right now and I'm I'm all I'm all for it
01:46:37 Yeah, that's good to hear
01:46:39 Yeah, the thing is get some of that that sweet money back from those those all that tax
01:46:45 They take for me every year for being self-employed and they double tax me. I'm finally getting a little bit of it back
01:46:50 Are you ready to get taxed on your unemployment money though? No, I'm not
01:46:54 Well
01:46:55 Get ready
01:46:57 That's coming
01:46:58 Um, it's only it's only the base though like the covet part is not taxable from what I understand
01:47:02 It's only the base $267 of unemployment that will be taxed wait
01:47:07 Really? I'm pretty sure the 600
01:47:09 Is is not taxable income
01:47:12 Oh boy. Oh, I should look into that. I'm pretty sure don't quote me on it
01:47:17 But I was watching some videos on the unemployment stuff and I'm pretty sure part of the decision was that that $600 is not taxable income
01:47:24 I know that the trump bucks are not taxable income
01:47:28 But unemployment is but like the 600 dollar like cares act bonus is a separate thing
01:47:34 So I could believe that maybe that doesn't count. I'll look fascinating. That's great. That's that's very I hope that's true
01:47:42 Uh, okay, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool
01:47:44 Uh
01:47:45 Dur
01:47:46 A dur
01:47:49 Uh, well
01:47:52 As to as to where everyone else is uh, I don't know
01:47:55 Yeah, I don't I I don't know why Nate's not around. I don't know. I guess I guess digi is
01:48:01 Doing other stuff. I don't fuck well digi digi is um extremely busy with
01:48:08 Like backed up projects and also gender well stuff and I can I can I can understand digi
01:48:16 Digi's digi's very busy with her gender right now
01:48:20 Yeah, loma. I guess I guess. Um, I'm backed up projects. I've got fucking. I've got backed up projects out the wazoo
01:48:28 Well, they're they're backed up projects like patreon reward things
01:48:33 That's that's what I've heard like I can understand that taking president
01:48:37 It is still only like a couple hours a week. It's it's like two hours. It's like two hours a week
01:48:43 That's like, uh, I don't know. I don't blame anybody for not feeling like coming on because sometimes no
01:48:49 It's it's it's a two hour podcast, but like you don't always want a podcast. You don't always have anything to say
01:48:55 you don't always
01:48:57 Feel like
01:48:58 Spilling your soul out to a bunch of people who will go lol fail
01:49:02 It is very strange to have Nate not showing up because like
01:49:07 Nate is Nate's on like every I'm on like almost every episode
01:49:11 I think Nate's the only one who's been on more episodes than I have
01:49:15 So he's always here
01:49:17 but now
01:49:18 It's all gone. It's all come tumbling down. No, no, it's fine. It's fine and it's good
01:49:26 Sure
01:49:28 Sure it is
01:49:30 I say this so that the patreons don't leave and then I can get all the money when I'm the only one left
01:49:35 The patreon the patrons will be like they'll hear this and they'll say oh no
01:49:39 We're on a sinking ship. They're gonna take me down with them. You gotta bail right now
01:49:45 If you're if you're on if you are a patron when the pcp crashes and burns when we all get cancelled
