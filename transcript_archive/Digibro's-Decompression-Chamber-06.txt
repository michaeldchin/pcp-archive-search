00:00:00 You know, I suspected a day was going to come when I was going to start feeling nostalgic
00:00:24 about things. I used to always say that I don't really get nostalgic because I think
00:00:30 most people, at least it seemed to me, like when people talked about things that made
00:00:35 them nostalgic, that nostalgia usually came from a place of wanting to go back to a time
00:00:43 when you were happier. Like, it seemed like so many people who were obsessed with nostalgia
00:00:49 properties or people who felt like their childhood was happier than their adulthood
00:00:54 is. And I never felt that way. I feel like everything's gotten much better. If you listen
00:01:02 to the previous podcast, The Depression Chamber, you know exactly why. I was pretty miserable
00:01:08 up until my twenties and now I feel great. But there is nostalgia is not that linear,
00:01:15 I don't think. And I think maybe I was just still too young to really feel nostalgia about
00:01:21 a lot of things. Because, you know, obviously most of the things I'm nostalgic about from
00:01:26 the past are the good memories I do have. You know, they're the things that helped me
00:01:30 get through all of those tough times. So they still have that impact of like, you know,
00:01:38 bringing a smile to my face to think back on how much these things meant to me back
00:01:42 at the time. But right now I have been in like an almost downward spiral of nostalgia.
00:01:49 That's maybe an over-dramatic way of putting it. But lately it's like, you know, I just
00:01:54 played through Pokemon Sun and Moon. And Pokemon's always a nostalgia thing, you know, because
00:01:59 it was a huge part of my childhood. Much more so than I think. I mean, Pokemon makes most
00:02:05 people nostalgic because they're like, oh yeah, I was really into that for like a year.
00:02:08 You know, for me, it's like that was what my life was for four years, you know, as a
00:02:12 kid. And it's not that it's ever completely gone away. And in fact, in recent years, it's
00:02:16 been even bigger because of, especially this year with Pokemon Go coming out and all these
00:02:21 nuzzlocks happening and stuff. And, you know, it felt kind of natural to play through Pokemon
00:02:26 Sun, whereas with X and Y, it was kind of like this whole return to Pokemon. But nonetheless,
00:02:31 it's still a nostalgia thing. You know, me and Victor have been recording Digi Bros.
00:02:36 I think the first episode of Bomberman will be out before this podcast. So you'll see
00:02:40 that, you know, we've been playing this old N64 game, which Digi Bros is usually old games.
00:02:45 We usually play classics, you know, but we're getting back into that. I've been listening
00:02:50 to a lot of old music, like music that I used to listen to when I was younger. Because this
00:02:57 year, I just kind of got sick of all the music I had. Because basically, I think I talked
00:03:03 about this a couple podcasts ago, maybe on the first decompression chamber that like,
00:03:07 you know, a couple years ago, I'd had a hard drive failure. So most of what is on my computer
00:03:12 is whatever was on my phone, which is just mostly newer stuff or stuff that I got into
00:03:16 in the last few years. And I've had a pretty consistent input of like new bands and new
00:03:22 stuff to listen to until this year. There's been barely anything I really liked this year.
00:03:27 It's been a real rough year for music for me. So I've been looking back a lot. I've been
00:03:31 downloading a lot of the old discographies, the bands I used to listen to all the time,
00:03:36 you know, sort of getting back into these old bands, remembering how much I liked these
00:03:39 records and why, even though most of it is very nostalgia, you know. And even the other
00:03:45 stuff I'm listening to that is stuff that I didn't listen to as a kid is still older
00:03:50 music. So, you know, lots of older, more nostalgic tunes going by. And then I've also been looking
00:03:56 more and more to my old work, like, because, you know, lately, I've entered this extreme
00:04:04 high productivity sort of frame of mind where I'm constantly putting out videos and vlogs
00:04:10 and all this other stuff and looking at all this new shit. And, and, and I feel like on
00:04:16 some level, I've become kind of a machine, you know, like I just kind of churn out product
00:04:21 and it's just ideas, ideas, ideas, here's an idea, that's a video, here's an idea, that's
00:04:25 a video. And there's a lot less, like, artistry to it. There's less of that open-minded creativity
00:04:31 of, like, expressing my, my innermost feelings and thoughts, you know, which a lot of my
00:04:36 older work was exceedingly personal. And I don't know whether it's a good thing or not
00:04:42 because, like, my current self kind of cringes at a lot of it. A lot of it's like, oh, God,
00:04:46 why did I have to try? Like, why did I feel like every little thing that was important
00:04:51 to me had to be out there, you know, even if some of it's gross or weird. But then I
00:04:57 kind of look at a lot of the stuff that I'm a fan of and a lot of it's like that, you
00:05:01 know, I guess it's only weird because it's me, but so much of what I consume is, like,
00:05:06 grossly personal and intense and in your face, you know. So maybe, maybe I'm missing out
00:05:14 on some level by, by the fact that now that I finally have an audience who could appreciate
00:05:18 those things, you know, those aspects of myself, I've sort of gotten that audience by not approaching
00:05:24 those subjects and I haven't had the desire to approach those subjects again. So it's,
00:05:29 it's kind of an odd, an odd sense of progression there. Like, like, I feel like my 20 year
00:05:36 old self would be kind of disappointed that, that my, my content now is so kind of clean
00:05:41 and straightforward. And I mean, not that it's totally that I'm still pretty, you know,
00:05:46 fairly out there, I think. I still make weird stuff every now and then, but the kind of
00:05:52 shit I made when I was younger was so much more like, gross. So what really brought this,
00:06:00 what really brought me into this is that I, I finally, and I hope this is also out on
00:06:06 my Reddit, I didn't want this to be a wide release, but I recorded an audio book of the
00:06:11 book that I wrote in 2010, which is very bad. It's not as bad as I expected, which is why
00:06:18 I decided to do an audio book of it. I thought the ideas were interesting, and that some
00:06:23 of it was kind of okay. And I really just want closure on the whole thing. I want to
00:06:27 finally be able to like, you know, not think about the story all the time. But the irony,
00:06:34 of course, is that reading through it again just reawakened all my memories about it.
00:06:39 It reminded me of what I was like back then, and what things I cared about, and I started
00:06:45 thinking about all these characters again, and who they were, and why, you know, a lot
00:06:49 of stuff I'd forgotten. So much of what's in this book, because I never read the book.
00:06:53 So much of it is stuff that was so typical of me at the time, and is not now, and it's
00:06:58 weird to feel that sort of dualism or dichotomy or something. I'm not sure what word I'm looking
00:07:07 for. But at the same time, it's kind of dragging me in. Like, it's reminding me of things that
00:07:14 I used to feel, and like, sort of prodding me to feel those things again. Like, hey,
00:07:19 didn't you care a lot about this subject, you know? But I don't now. So it's very jarring
00:07:25 and strange. And like, just being surrounded with so much nostalgia stuff, like my mind
00:07:31 is trying to rush back to this time. And if I had to over explain it, and I don't know
00:07:36 this is really the case, maybe it's just a coincidence. But I do feel like maybe there's
00:07:41 some yearning on my part to return to when I was more artistically minded, when I was
00:07:47 more expressive and more like, trying to feel something deeper or more romantic than what
00:07:55 I do now, because I've just become such a machine. I've become such a content, just,
00:08:00 you know, crank. Like, now it's just every day I've got some kind of vlog or some kind
00:08:06 of podcast. I do so many back to back podcasts that I can't even like, I can't edit them
00:08:13 fast enough. Like, the reason this episode is delayed is just that I was working on
00:08:18 so many other things that there was no room for a decompression podcast. Like, I'm finally,
00:08:26 as of probably when this is coming out, I've probably started releasing these Let's Plays.
00:08:29 I have a whole month of Let's Plays. I have, you know, 12 episodes of Bomberman, and we're
00:08:34 probably going to finish that game and schedule it for the rest of the month and like, 15 plus
00:08:40 episodes of Wario Land 4 with me and Davoo. So those are all coming out now. And I had those
00:08:45 sitting on my computer for a while, because I couldn't edit them because I was doing too many
00:08:48 other things. I have my three hour commentaries I released at the end of the month, edited one of
00:08:54 those, I edit the PCP, and I'm on it every week. I don't edit the Pub Crawl, but I'm on that every
00:09:00 week. You know, I've got this podcast now. I guest on people, I guested on Mumkey. It was like,
00:09:08 the last three days were, we did a Pokemon PCP, that was two hours. Then the next day,
00:09:14 I guested on Mumkey's thing, which was an hour. And then the next day, I guested on Pub Crawl,
00:09:18 which is an hour. And like, just doing those three back to back, it's like every day I had to be
00:09:23 prepared for, you're gonna spend an hour doing a podcast today, in between editing other podcasts
00:09:29 and having vlog ideas. And then I'm also working on like, this hour long video that I've been
00:09:36 fucking putting off constantly, because it's kind of a pain in the ass to edit. And it's not, it's
00:09:40 not that great. So like, it's, it's, it's like a way too big of a video for the level of quality
00:09:46 that it is, you know, that I just kind of don't feel like editing. And then I'm also editing the
00:09:50 audiobook, which is even less of high quality. It's, it's painful because it's bad, like editing,
00:09:56 putting so much effort into something that is bad, is painful. It's like, you know, I'm fucking
00:10:04 sitting there trying to make sure that I add enough gap, like, because I don't want it to be, you
00:10:09 know, shitty. But it's hard to like, time out how long should the gaps be between me reading each
00:10:15 sentence in an audiobook, what would make for a comfortable listening experience of this terrible
00:10:20 book, you know, like, oh God, there is no comfortable listening experience, because the story
00:10:26 itself makes me uncomfortable. It's such a nightmare. But just being surrounded with all this
00:10:33 nostalgia, while I'm in the middle of being like this, this, this mechanism of content creation is
00:10:40 pulling me in weird directions. And I feel like I need to take a step back sometime soon, you
00:10:46 know, like, because so much of this is just for the hell of it. Like, there's no reason for me to
00:10:50 put out this much content. It's totally like, it's totally asinine that I've gotten myself involved
00:10:56 in so many things, like that I stacked this podcast on top of like, you know, pub crawls every
00:11:01 week, which is low effort, low, low on my part, because I just show up and talk, you know, and
00:11:07 drink, though the drinking can be a bit of a commitment. If I get myself drunk, then I'm kind
00:11:11 of stuck that way. For the rest of the night. But PCP, like, you know, I'm editing them. I don't
00:11:19 know why I don't know why I'm on every episode, I don't need to be, you know, you've got enough
00:11:23 people, you can always do it without me, but I always end up showing up in doing that, and taking
00:11:30 all these other podcast offers and shit, and then editing this. And it's so unnecessary, and I don't
00:11:37 need to have a vlog out every day, and I don't need to do all this. I've been doing more and more
00:11:41 unpaid work, like for myself. I keep giving myself more things that are like, something I just post
00:11:46 on my Reddit, you know, like something that has no nothing to do with anything is just a pure passion
00:11:53 project. And it's like, I mean, it's cool that this is what I like doing. But I think I need to get
00:11:58 a girlfriend. I need it. And I started thinking, like the way I've been thinking about stuff like
00:12:03 that is like, like I was seriously contemplating just like buying a love doll and being like, I
00:12:11 don't, you know, well, if my lifestyle is going to be that I never leave the house and never talk
00:12:16 to any other humans, I might as well have some companionship, you know, but it's like, maybe
00:12:21 what needs to change is the lifestyle. Maybe I shouldn't be living a life where I do nothing
00:12:26 but make videos so often that I can't even talk to other people, you know, considering I've made
00:12:33 no effort in that regard. I haven't even tried. I have not once like attempted just talking
00:12:40 to someone, you know, or, or trying to date or something. And I feel like that would be a great
00:12:47 distraction. It's a great way to get out like, you know, I'm always saying, oh, I need some kind
00:12:52 of hobby other than just making videos, you know, like that would be a good hobby, something to
00:12:57 occupy some of that time. As long as it was a healthy relationship with which God knows how
00:13:02 to find one of those, you know, but again, I haven't even tried. So who knows what's out there.
00:13:11 Yeah, I just feel like I'm getting too wrapped up in my work. I'm doing too, doing too much as
00:13:17 bus driver saying about way too much and, and, and bugging myself in all this nostalgia is kind
00:13:27 of not helping. It's just igniting like the way it's reminding me of the artistic passions I had
00:13:35 when I was younger that I don't really feel anymore. But I feel like I like I'm supposed to
00:13:39 or something like I feel guilty for not doing more unpaid work for not doing more like a,
00:13:46 like, you know, speak from the soul kind of shit, which I really don't need in my life.
00:13:52 Like it's not something I think would be fun to do. It would just be a bunch of bullshit, you know,
00:13:58 and I'm editing a book I wrote fucking six years ago. That's not even good for some reason.
00:14:06 But hopefully when I'm done with it, that'll all be behind me and I can get back to
00:14:13 whatever I do. I don't know. I don't know what it like. I don't see any future for myself,
00:14:18 like outside of this. Like everyone else I know, I think has this mindset that, that things are going
00:14:25 to, things are going to change eventually, you know, like, you're going to hit a certain amount of
00:14:31 money that you're making or a certain amount of fame and things are going to change in some
00:14:36 meaningful way. Like, you know, Jesse is trying to save up enough money that he can get himself
00:14:42 like a nice car and move into his own place and start traveling the country. That's his dream.
00:14:47 He wants to see the real America travel the country. You know, Nate wants to eventually
00:14:55 make enough money on his art that he can become a full-time artist. Hippo wants the same thing.
00:15:00 Tommy Oliver wants the same thing. You know, he wants to finally release the shackles of being a
00:15:07 video maker and having a day, two day jobs and just become a writer. You know, they all want
00:15:13 something different from what they have. I'm sure DeVu, you know, even though he's comfortable
00:15:17 right now editing for me, I'm sure he'd eventually like to be famous on his own terms, you know,
00:15:22 and make stuff for himself. I know he wants to be a game developer eventually or at least to make,
00:15:28 he wants to make enough money one day that he can pay people to bring his game ideas to life.
00:15:32 You know, all those guys have all these other, all these other goals and all I ever really wanted
00:15:37 was to make enough money doing whatever I want that I could continue doing whatever I want.
00:15:43 And I'm already there. I don't know where to go from here. There's no,
00:15:47 there's no higher ceiling than what I've achieved. You know, I already make enough money.
00:15:52 I don't need any more. There's nothing I want that's so expensive that I can't afford it, you know.
00:16:00 There's no challenge that I've yet to undertake that I feel like, you know, like there's certain
00:16:08 video projects I'm working on, but I don't think they're any harder or more like more relevant
00:16:14 than what I did before. Like I kind of feel like I, after like the Astroscore series, like I wrote
00:16:19 a book in video form, that's like, that was kind of my highest echelon of what I thought could be
00:16:24 done with the with analysis videos and I've already hit it. So from here, it's just like, you know,
00:16:30 maintaining that level. So it's like, there's got to be something else I can do, you know, like,
00:16:39 not to say that it's kind of like with lifting, like me and Ben have been lifting, right? And
00:16:45 every other day, we raise our weight limit, like we, we, we lift every other day and like,
00:16:51 we do squats and it's like, today I'm doing 205. So the next time we do squats, I do 210, you know,
00:16:57 and keep pushing it further so that your muscles keep expanding. And then eventually,
00:17:03 when you hit your max, that's when you just start doing maintenance, when you just start
00:17:08 lifting the same amount just to keep the figure you currently have. And that's where I am. I'm
00:17:12 just doing maintenance. I'm just doing reps to keep things the way they are, you know,
00:17:17 my Patreon's not really going up significantly anymore. It's just kind of sat in a place,
00:17:22 you know, my view counts are not significantly going up. So I'm kind of like, you know, for the
00:17:28 last couple months, it's been like, all right, this is how much money I make, you know, this is
00:17:32 how many videos I can get out in a month, which is three to five, pretty much. This is the level
00:17:38 of quality that me and DeVu can achieve. You know, DeVu doesn't seem to be trying to like push
00:17:43 himself to do like bigger and better editing jobs, you know, he's, if anything, he's more
00:17:49 into streamlining it, you know, and trying to get more done in less time. And he's just been
00:17:54 spending all his off time watching tons and tons of anime. So like, yeah, I don't know, I feel
00:18:01 stagnant. And I don't, it's weird, I don't want to say like, I hate it, because I feel fine,
00:18:08 you know, everything's fine. It's just that like, it's weird to not have an image of where
00:18:14 things are supposed to go from here, because I always did before. I always had a, there's the
00:18:19 next peak, there's the next thing I have to get to. And like, the only thing I really have to be
00:18:24 that is money, like make more money, make significantly more money. But I don't need
00:18:29 any more money. I don't know what I'm going to do with that money. If I get it, my savings are
00:18:33 getting ridiculous right now, you know, like I have a ton of money saved up. I don't need a whole
00:18:38 lot more. You know, this month, this past month, November, because I'm recording this on the 30th,
00:18:46 like I had this goal that me and DeVoo were going to put out five videos because I was like,
00:18:50 yeah, we didn't, we didn't get out that many in the last couple months, you know,
00:18:54 so we didn't make a shit ton of money. So this month, let's try to make more money than before.
00:18:58 And then like, we were coming up on the end of the month and I had the fifth video that we had
00:19:03 planned as like a more complicated one than the other ones. And we didn't really have enough time
00:19:06 to do it. And at first I was like, all right, we're going to buckle down, we're just going to work
00:19:10 nonstop for four days, you know, but then it was like, we were already having like complications
00:19:15 gathering all the footage. And so I was like, all right, well, you know, let's just put it on,
00:19:19 let's let's just put that video on hold, I'll just write a shorter video that we can do by the
00:19:23 end of the month. And then I was going through like trying to come up with one that would be easy
00:19:26 enough to do. And then I was just like, why I don't even need to, I don't need to, I made enough
00:19:31 money on the four videos we've already made. There's no need to force myself to make a fifth video,
00:19:37 especially when I'm in the middle of editing this audio book and doing all this other shit.
00:19:41 So fuck it, you know, why push myself? Why am I, why am I trying so hard when it's not going to
00:19:48 change anything? And that's, that's a, I don't, yeah, that's the thing I don't like. Like, it's
00:19:54 not that I feel day to day pain, like I feel great, but I, it's, it's, you know, I'm looking at Casey
00:20:02 Neistat over here who just canceled his vlog and like moved in this whole, you know, different
00:20:07 direction just because he felt like he'd plateaued. And I'm like, that's how I feel, you know, but it's
00:20:12 not showing in my work, because everything I do is still unique and interesting. And, and I still
00:20:18 really like the videos I'm making, you know, I think everything I'm putting out is great. I think
00:20:22 the vlogs are, you know, are always interesting, fresh little ideas. The podcasts show at least
00:20:30 somewhat different angles of the same, you know, opinions and stuff. But like, I don't know, I
00:20:37 don't know what I'm doing. I think, I think the best solution is not right now, I don't think the
00:20:45 solution is take on an even bigger project, because there really is no bigger project that I
00:20:52 need to do. What I really need to do is find something else to do, something else to be
00:20:57 passionate about. So, you know, like a relationship would be the obvious answer. That's the one
00:21:03 that's like, yeah, that'll occupy your time. It's something that, you know, that I probably want.
00:21:08 But do I even for any like, why even? I don't know. It's so weird. I don't know what else I would
00:21:16 want to do though. There's nothing else that I'm interested in like, becoming passionate. I don't
00:21:21 want to play sports, you know. I don't want to just pick up some random fucking hobby to do. I don't
00:21:32 want a day job, because I like my sleep, I like being able to sleep and wake up whenever I want,
00:21:37 even though the last few days I just like straight up slept like for the majority of two days. Like,
00:21:45 I felt weird and shitty because I had eaten something wrong and sat in a chair for too long
00:21:51 recording an audiobook for fucking six hours and then I just felt like shit and just kind of passed
00:21:55 out for the better part of two days. So, and the idea that there's no negative consequence for that
00:22:07 is almost scary. So I guess that's where I'm at. I'm too comfortable. I need to find something
00:22:16 interesting to do with myself other than making videos. But I don't want to stop, you know,
00:22:23 none of this is to say I want to stop what I'm doing now. Like, unlike Casey in the vlog, I don't
00:22:27 think anything I'm doing has gotten dry. I don't think I need to stop doing vlogs or change the
00:22:32 nature of my videos. Like, all those are going fine. I just need another thing. Alright, I'm
00:22:39 probably repeating myself at this point, so I'll see you in the next part.
00:22:46 Okay, so this is me coming back a few hours later after the previous recording and I feel
00:22:55 at my wit's end when it comes to understanding the world and other people and my place within it.
00:23:04 Because I decided, you know, after I said all that stuff in the last part, the last part where
00:23:09 I was like, hey, you know, maybe I should seek out a relationship. Maybe I should start dating. I
00:23:14 was like, well, let's just get to it. Let's put my money where my mouth is. Let's go sign up for
00:23:20 some dating sites. So I went around and looked at a bunch of them and made some profiles. And I just
00:23:27 don't get it at all. Like, none of the parameters that are suggested on a dating site on any of the
00:23:35 ones I looked at seem like any reason that I'd want to talk to someone. You know, like,
00:23:42 they're like hobbies and like all this really general information and all this like boring
00:23:47 shit. I was just like, none of this makes me interested in a person that I'd want to talk to
00:23:52 them or, or, you know, like, and everyone just looks like aliens to me. I don't know what it is.
00:23:58 People, no one looks human to me. All of the women I was, I was looking at, I was just like,
00:24:05 you know, something about seeing just a photo of someone. It's like, it's not even a person.
00:24:10 I don't know. I feel so weird looking at like other humans, especially like just normies,
00:24:17 you know, everyone I looked at has this just looks like a normal person. I don't know how to
00:24:21 communicate with normal people. I don't like, when I see someone who looks particularly normal,
00:24:27 then I just feel like I would have nothing to talk to this person. Like, I have no idea how I
00:24:32 would communicate with a normal looking person. You know, it's, it's a bizarre feeling. I was
00:24:39 like, I guess I need to look at some kind of like dating site for weirdos. And then I looked into
00:24:43 those, but then everyone there looked weird. So I don't know what the fuck I'm looking for.
00:24:50 I don't know how to fill in information on these sites. Everyone that I get matched with seems to
00:24:55 have way more interest than I do. I have such a narrow field of interests, which I guess sounds
00:25:03 weird, because like all of my interests are just media consumption, which to me, like, you know,
00:25:07 to people who are into media, I guess that's like a broad range. Oh, you're into anime and comics
00:25:12 and movies and all this stuff. But like to me, that's kind of all just one umbrella. You know,
00:25:16 like if you're, if you're filling out stuff on a dating site, that's really just one thing. Like,
00:25:20 I like movies and you know, and maybe you could check video games and maybe, maybe art or music.
00:25:29 But there's no like, you know, that's like, that's like a drop in the bucket of all the things that
00:25:34 are listed as like things you could be interested in. And I have no interest in anything else,
00:25:39 other than eating out. One of the profiles I made, it just made it look like all I care about
00:25:45 is eating out, which I guess is fair. I do go out to eat a lot, but like, it just felt like that was
00:25:53 my only hobby in the world, because it was the only thing I listed as like something I go out to do
00:25:58 for fun. I don't even know what kind of human being I want to talk to. I don't know what I'm
00:26:05 looking for out of anybody, you know, like, because I don't need any friends. I have enough friends,
00:26:11 so I'm just looking for someone to date. But what the hell do I want to talk to them about?
00:26:15 What are the parameters? I have no idea. I went through Reddit, I went on all these different
00:26:20 dating subreddits where people are talking about dating, but all of their problems are totally
00:26:24 unrelatable to me, you know. One of my concerns is like, I mean, I'm like an internet personality
00:26:32 guy, you know, like, I don't know how to describe myself without talking about the fact that like,
00:26:40 what I do is I make videos all the time. Like, that's who I am. I don't think I have a personality.
00:26:45 I think I'm like, I think, I think I've reached a point in my life where I just am a thing that
00:26:52 appears in videos. You know, like, there's no life outside of that. There's no additional me,
00:26:59 you know, what I do for decompression time is make a fucking podcast. When I'm not making a podcast,
00:27:03 I'm making a podcast. I, there's nothing left of me. And there's no, there's no dating site for
00:27:12 girls who are into guys who make podcasts all the fucking time. You know, that's like a,
00:27:19 I don't, I don't know how to, I don't know how to be interesting or to find interest in anyone.
00:27:28 Um, there's certainly, I don't know any, like, uh, like, hot single girls who are into podcasting,
00:27:38 you know, like, seeking companionship and someone to do podcasts with, like, that's the kind of ad
00:27:46 that would grab my eye. Oh God, I found some hilarious dating sites. The funniest one I saw
00:27:56 is called Awake Dating. And it's literally for people who are like, awake to the truth. It was
00:28:02 like, basically woke. They could, they should have called it woke dating or stay woke dating,
00:28:07 because that's literally what it was about. It was, it was hilarious to realize that's a place.
00:28:12 Um, but then I thought, I wonder if that's, I wonder if I need a, if I need a black pilled partner.
00:28:19 Uh, stay woke dating. Oh God. Yeah, I don't know, I don't know who, I don't even know
00:28:30 who to talk to for advice about my particular problems, because who else in the world's dating
00:28:37 issue is I have no personality outside of the fact that I make podcasts and vlogs and that's my life.
00:28:45 Or, or just like looking for someone to, you know, to understand where I'm coming from when I dump
00:28:56 dialogue on them for 20 hours a day. I don't know.
00:28:59 Uh, all right. Well, continuing where I left off after about just shy of two days
00:29:19 of trying my hand at the misery that that is online dating where everything's weird
00:29:27 and nothing makes sense. And, and as a guy, you really, you, you really are fighting a losing
00:29:35 battle because, and I know this to be true, not just from women saying it, but from the way I
00:29:41 see other guys using dating apps, that women are just constantly, constantly getting likes and
00:29:48 messages from every guy on the planet. I mean, basically the way guys use a site like Tinder
00:29:55 is just hit like on absolutely everybody. And therefore with girls, they basically can just
00:30:02 take their time and sift through all the guys who've hit like on them and respond to which ones that,
00:30:09 you know, they think are attractive or, or interesting, read a bunch of articles, sort of
00:30:15 corroborating this as well. But yeah, that's sort of the phenomenon of, of internet dating.
00:30:23 So for me, it's just a matter of like every once in a while happening to stumble upon the one out
00:30:29 of 30 profiles that I actually think is pretty interesting. I'll be like, huh, this girl's
00:30:35 actually kind of cute, and she's got a decently written profile. That's cool. And then I hit like,
00:30:40 and then chances are that is the end of my interaction forever, you know, that they're
00:30:45 not going to hit like on my picture, especially because I have no good pictures of myself. There
00:30:51 are really none that exist. Certainly no current ones that are good. You know, I tried taking some
00:30:57 selfies of myself, but I don't know, I think I personally think I look like a psycho killer
00:31:02 in every picture I take of myself. So I'm sure others feel similarly. And, and yeah, I just feel
00:31:11 like there's no odds of getting that swipe back, you know, or getting that response to a message
00:31:17 somewhere. But I do think it's fascinating, especially Tinder. Tinder is basically a video
00:31:24 game, because it's just it's this it's the most simplified version version of finding people
00:31:33 interesting or attractive, right? It's like, you just see a picture. And so immediately you decide
00:31:39 based on the first thing you see, like, is this person even, you know, in my wheelhouse of what
00:31:45 I'm attracted to. So first, you just make that decision right out the gate. If you're unsure,
00:31:49 you look at a couple more pictures. And then they typically have like, a sentence to a paragraph
00:31:56 describing themselves, often not even sometimes they have no information. But at most they have a
00:32:01 sentence to a paragraph and you kind of look at it. And you decide, is this person two into dogs
00:32:08 or not? Because about 50% of everyone is just way into dogs, who's on these sites. And I hate
00:32:16 dogs. So I decided whether or not they're two into dogs, and then choose whether to hit like or
00:32:23 dislike on their profile. It's a little more complex than that. But, but I feel like it only
00:32:30 is for me, I feel like most people don't even make it as far as I do in that decision making
00:32:34 process. And then like, that's it, you just keep swiping, and then do that forever and then see
00:32:40 no results. And yeah, it's just a video game. It's like, it's like finding out both what your
00:32:49 tastes are exactly and how many people in your area fit them, and then doing nothing with the
00:32:55 information. That's basically the game that you're playing. So it's a huge waste of time. I spent
00:33:01 like hours swiping in different directions on Tinder. It was a bottomless fucking pit. Never
00:33:07 fucking hit the end. I'm pretty sure there's supposed to be a limit to how many likes you have
00:33:11 in a day, never hit it. It started cycling me back through people I'd already swiped on,
00:33:17 you know, after a few hours. And I was just like, Oh, God, this is a this is a fucking hell.
00:33:24 You know, looking on the online websites. It's just so weird for me to imagine myself talking to
00:33:30 most people. Like, the kind of people who I've spoken to in my life, there's there's very much
00:33:36 a type of person identifiable by sight, who I think of as like, my people, you know, like,
00:33:42 this is the kind of person who I see them. And I think that's the kind of person I'm used to talking
00:33:47 to, you know, and sometimes someone doesn't quite look like the kind of person I expect myself to
00:33:52 talk to. But I read their description. And I think, Okay, they seem in the wheelhouse of people
00:33:57 I've spoken to before, you know, or, or I think I could find an approach to talk to this person.
00:34:03 But it's, you know, it's weird to think that there's such a huge dichotomy between a kind of person
00:34:09 I'm used to talking to, which is basically nerds, you know, nerdy girls tend to look a certain way,
00:34:18 even if they're not even to say about like, whether they're attractive or not, just like,
00:34:23 I don't know, I feel like there's a certain way that people who like go to anime cons or,
00:34:29 or watch YouTube videos look, it's just this like, and everyone else just looks like a normie to me,
00:34:34 you know, and when I see the normie girls, I'm like, I can't imagine having a conversation with
00:34:39 someone like this. Maybe it's just a weird vein kind of like metric I'm using, but I don't know,
00:34:46 it feels strange. But anyways, in the midst of all this, I thought it would be interesting to talk
00:34:51 about, to talk about the kind of flirting that happens just from being an internet personality,
00:34:58 because I feel like some people who are listening to this must be thinking,
00:35:01 surely you have a reach of like hundreds of thousands of people who watch your videos,
00:35:08 many of whom are fans of you, surely some of those people are interested in you romantically. And
00:35:16 yeah, let me touch on that subject, because it can be interesting.
00:35:22 So I'd say pretty much everybody I know, who's a content creator, creator, or has been for a
00:35:27 long enough time, has done some kind of flirting with fans of their work or people who watch their
00:35:34 stuff and you know, and are interested in them romantically or sexually. I'd say everybody
00:35:41 is at least flirted with someone, you know, whether or not they've actually gotten into a
00:35:44 relationship before. And about, I mean, half of the PCP has been in relationships with people we
00:35:50 met through our work, you know, whether they were fans or, or just, you know, found out about us
00:35:57 through the work, particularly. And if you followed me for long enough, you know, that was what my
00:36:04 first and last relationship was like, was I was dating a girl for six months on the basis that
00:36:09 she was a big fan of my work. And she was in the pub crawl chat. And just like I was literally
00:36:17 complaining about how I don't have a I was 23 and it never had a girlfriend. And she was like,
00:36:23 I'll be your girlfriend. And I was like, Oh, really? But you know, here's why it's here's why
00:36:30 it can be weird. And I don't I don't get flirted with a lot. Not a lot of girls come out and say
00:36:36 anything, you know, I don't know if it's just because they think that like, because I know
00:36:42 there's girls who are interested. And I hear about it sometimes something like, like, Sider has told
00:36:47 me many times over the years that there's like girls who talk to him about how they like me,
00:36:51 but they never talk to me about how they like me. And I don't know if it's just because I'm, you
00:36:57 know, somewhat internet famous, maybe I'm hard to approach, you know, or you're just scared,
00:37:02 you think it won't work. But um, but yeah, I rarely rarely get approached. But even when I do,
00:37:10 it's super weird because I feel like, and this is what I realized this because of Tinder, because
00:37:16 I actually think that aside from the fact that you never get anyone responding to you on Tinder,
00:37:21 as a guy, I think it has the perfect information that I need to know before I'll talk to somebody,
00:37:28 which is what do you look like? How old are you? And where are you? Those are the those are three
00:37:35 pieces of information I consider to be crucial before I'm going to even consider, like, you know,
00:37:40 approaching you on a romantic level. Because, like, you know, if if we're trying to hook up if we're
00:37:48 trying to, you know, test the waters of dating or whatever, then like, it's kind of important that
00:37:53 we're attracted to one another, you know, and like, you already know what I look like. If someone's
00:37:59 messaging me, they know what I look like, I've got a thousand videos out there, but I have no
00:38:02 idea what you look like. And it takes a while, it takes a while of talking to somebody who's like
00:38:08 your fan, who's someone who knows you from online, you know, who you're trying to like kind of be
00:38:13 polite to because there's someone who likes your work. It takes a while to get to the point where
00:38:17 you're like, Hey, can I see what you look like? You know, and that's a it's a it's it's also very
00:38:25 weird. And it feels terrible to reach that point in the conversation to get pictures of somebody,
00:38:31 and then to see, Oh, I'm not attracted to this person, and then to try to get your way back out
00:38:36 of the conversation. Like, you know, it sounds it might sound shallow or something, but I'm sure
00:38:42 you all understand what that would be like, you know, to reach to reach that point, and then have
00:38:48 to kind of backpedal, especially to someone who you don't want to hurt their feelings, because
00:38:53 they like your stuff, you know. So yeah, that's the first problem is that people don't tend to just
00:39:00 upfront have pictures of themselves. I mean, and I can guarantee it would feel weird to send someone
00:39:07 pictures of yourself randomly, someone you, you know, you're a fan of and you don't know and you
00:39:12 just send them pictures of yourself might seem a little presumptuous, but I promise you, it would
00:39:17 be a huge help. If someone did that. And then also age, where I've had times where people like flirt
00:39:26 in my comments and stuff, you know, they'll say things like, Oh, digi, you're so sexy or something.
00:39:32 And I'm like, if you're like a 17 year old, then I'm not going to like hit you up, you know, like,
00:39:38 I've had people who seem to be like flirting in the comments that I'm like, I don't want to approach
00:39:42 this. If it turns out that this person's underage, you know, I mean, I probably won't even date somebody
00:39:48 under 21. But if you're under 18, then obviously not, you know. So like, that's the second thing
00:39:54 that makes it weird. And then location, because the last relationship I was in, the girl lived
00:40:01 in Montana at the time, you know, anytime we actually wanted to see each other, that was a $400
00:40:06 round trip playing ticket. So, you know, at the time I was inexperienced and didn't mind. But in
00:40:14 retrospect, I was like, I don't want, I don't want to be in a relationship where just actually
00:40:21 spending time together costs an enormous sum of money, you know, like it feels like the relationship
00:40:26 is tied to spending a shit ton of money just to hang out. And that's why, and then also like,
00:40:34 you end up like way overcompensating for the fact that you don't see each other that often in person
00:40:40 by constantly seeing each other online. And that's excessive, you know, I don't want relationships
00:40:46 where I end up in Skype conversations all day, which is what happened last time, you know. So
00:40:50 like, that's why, even though it seems like, you know, you'd think, well, I have a huge audience,
00:40:58 some of those people must be interested. But like, it's just that I don't know anything about anybody,
00:41:02 you know, I don't know anything about the people who, who post like one little flirtatious line,
00:41:08 you know, maybe hoping I'll follow up on it. But it's like, I have, you have way more information
00:41:14 about me than I do about you. You just constantly hear me at my most interesting, at my, at my best,
00:41:20 you know, doing podcasts, talking about myself, learning everything about my life and what I'm
00:41:26 up to and what my interests are. You don't need any icebreaker for me. But I know absolutely nothing
00:41:32 other than the vague sense that maybe you're not joking about being interested, you know, which
00:41:39 even then I have no idea when people are joking. And I get lots of attention from, from men as well,
00:41:45 you know, like I've had plenty of gay guys who talk about how hot I am. So I don't want to pursue
00:41:49 you only to find out that you're not even a woman or, or anything, you know, there's just,
00:41:56 there's a thousand way a troll, you could just be a troll, you know, as a, as someone who's known on
00:42:02 the internet, plenty of people want to troll me. It was funny too, I like, there's, there was stuff
00:42:07 like a, like an anime dating site. And I was like, it would be tempting to go on here because I think
00:42:11 it's funny that it's like a site that matches you based on your taste in anime. But I was like,
00:42:17 everyone on here would, would know who I am or they, or they could easily find out, you know,
00:42:22 people who, who know me from my videos and think of me as like a mimetic character might be on here,
00:42:29 you know, I might try to troll me or something and it's just a huge waste of time. So yeah, that's
00:42:35 why it's really weird to try and pursue these kinds of relationships. And I'm not saying,
00:42:42 you know, don't, I'm saying, I mean, if you want to send me messages where you actually say,
00:42:47 hey, I'm being completely legitimate, here's three pictures of me at my age and location,
00:42:53 that would be greatly appreciated. And it would be fucking hilarious if it worked, because then
00:42:58 it would prove that the only game I have is complaining about how I don't have any,
00:43:05 how I don't have a girlfriend online. That would mean that that's the only way I know how to get
00:43:09 relationships, which would be sad and hilarious. But I don't know, I'd be okay with it because
00:43:17 it's not working out any other way. Yeah. So I was giving some thought to why exactly I'm so
00:43:28 frustrated with all this, like with this whole online dating thing, because I mean, two days ago,
00:43:33 I felt totally fine about whatever I was doing. I think I did. I don't remember. But,
00:43:40 but once I started this, I started feeling just totally down and depressed and upset.
00:43:47 And I think it's just a matter of like putting effort into something that has absolutely no
00:43:54 tangible or evident benefit, and in which I feel completely out of my depth, which is not something
00:44:00 I'm used to. I'm used to things that I can do and immediately understand the benefits, right? Like
00:44:09 a vlog. I come up with an idea for a vlog. I record it instantly, post it online instantly, get, you
00:44:16 know, the reaction I want instantly. I'm used to lots of that. Like I'm, I have a very confident
00:44:22 approach to everything I do in my life. I know exactly what I'm going to get out of it, and how
00:44:26 much work it'll take to reach the finish line, you know, and, and there's always that exact like
00:44:32 feeling of I'm doing something I know what to do, know how to do, and, and I can do it and know
00:44:39 everything about it and feel the payoff. But with this, it's just like throwing,
00:44:45 throwing stones at a barn blindfolded and trying to hit the blind side of a barn,
00:44:51 uh, literally blind. I don't know how you, I don't know exactly what the blind side of a barn is.
00:44:58 Um, yeah, and I just don't know what I'm doing. So it's like, it's like, I have no idea if I'm
00:45:03 even going in the right direction with anything I'm posting. Like am I just totally off base with
00:45:08 the pictures I'm choosing or the descriptions I'm writing, or by even attempting this? Am I on the
00:45:14 completely wrong websites? You know, I've, I've been doing tons of research. Like my approach to
00:45:19 something like this is find every Reddit board with any information about this,
00:45:24 find every article about this, figure out exactly what I'm doing, and I've come to
00:45:28 basically no conclusions. Um, so that's what's so frustrating about it. And I was thinking about how
00:45:36 there would be ways to make it, like if it wasn't for the fact that all these websites and stuff
00:45:42 ask questions or, or base their stuff on parameters that like don't mean a lot to me,
00:45:48 that's kind of part of the issue. Like for instance,
00:45:52 these sites will always have something like, you know, what are some of your favorite books
00:45:56 and movies and TV shows and stuff. And like to me, that's not a very helpful question because at
00:46:05 best we're going to have like one or two things we both like, who boy, you know, like maybe it'll
00:46:09 give me something to talk about like, oh, you like Rick and Morty, I like Rick and Morty, that's cool.
00:46:15 But like, it doesn't really cut to the heart of the matter, which is how much do you care about
00:46:20 TV and movies and books, you know, like you can have a favorite book that you read five years ago,
00:46:27 and you don't really think about it or talk about it, you just list it when the topic of
00:46:31 favorite books comes up. What it should really say is like, how often do you read? How much do you
00:46:38 like books, you know, how much does your favorite media mean to you? Then we have an idea of where
00:46:45 this is going, you know, like, if I bring up that book, are you going to be like, oh my god,
00:46:51 someone to talk about this book with, you know, like when I when I list out this stuff, I always go
00:46:56 really basic because you would think, well, Digi's got a million favorites, surely he'll list all of
00:47:02 them, but to me, it's like, no one cares, that's the way I see it, like who would possibly care
00:47:08 that I like these 500 different fucking, you know, anime shows, most people never heard of any of them,
00:47:13 you know, so I usually just post like, I like a lot of anime, you know, like basically all anime,
00:47:18 I think it's what I listed on one profile, like, you know, it's, it's a huge difference between
00:47:25 I like this show and I care about this show, and I think a lot of the answers on these websites
00:47:31 could be more like that, you know, like they say like, do you like food? It's like, yeah,
00:47:37 everybody likes food, everybody likes going out to eat, how often do you go out to eat? How much
00:47:42 money do you spend when you go out to eat? These are questions I want to know, you know, because
00:47:47 like me and my friends go out to eat all the time, I almost as often as I can, I take somebody out
00:47:51 with me, but most of my friends are cheap, you know, most of my friends don't spend as much on
00:47:56 food as I do, so you know, that determines where we're going and what we're doing, you know, if I,
00:48:01 if you like to eat out every single day, probably I'm not gonna always pay for every meal we have
00:48:07 together, but if we eat out all the time, then that would be super cool, it'd be interesting,
00:48:11 like how much, not just how much money do you make, but how much do you spend on food?
00:48:17 Is there anybody who eats out as often as I do? Another question, what's your sleep schedule?
00:48:23 Now, I know that for most people, the answer will probably be the same,
00:48:27 but for someone like me, I'm currently recording this at three o'clock in the morning and I
00:48:31 like just woke up like an hour ago after a series of weird, and all I've been doing for the last
00:48:38 two days other than dating sites is like sleeping and jacking off intermittently, it's just been
00:48:43 like this nonstop back and forth, wake up, up for like an hour, jack off, fall back to sleep,
00:48:51 it's just been like constant ever since, ever since a few days ago, so before even this whole,
00:48:59 this whole thing started, it's just been the last few days for me.
00:49:03 So, so how, when are you awake? How often are you awake? What times are you most active?
00:49:09 Do you prefer to go out and hang out at noon, or do you prefer to hang out at night, or do you
00:49:13 prefer to hang out at three in the morning? Do you actually find things to do at three in the morning,
00:49:18 you know? These are all the kind of questions I want the answers to in a dating profile.
00:49:27 How about, how about how many times per day do you leave the house, or per week, per month,
00:49:35 to go do a thing? Like, do you like to go out with other people, or by yourself? Because I like
00:49:42 to go out every day with other people if I can, you know, me and Victor, anytime Victor's home,
00:49:47 we're either going to go to lunch, or we're going to go check out, like, the bookstore,
00:49:52 the comic store, just like, I want to get out of the house, and I don't like going out alone,
00:49:56 you know, so I prefer to snatch up Ben or DeVue and be like, hey, I'm going to this place,
00:50:03 you want to come, you know, even if it's just like a short drive, who wants to come with me?
00:50:08 You know, are you into that person on dating profile? How often do you leave the house with
00:50:13 other people? How often do you go to just, you know, frivolously spend money on food to do something
00:50:21 that's not sit at home, you know? Or do you have much more exciting things you go out and do
00:50:26 that are unbeknownst to me, that I don't even realize exist, you know? I've had a,
00:50:33 there's like, two people, well, only one who I actually messaged, but there were two people on
00:50:39 OkCupid who I had like a decent match percentage with, and one of them said, like, it said, like,
00:50:45 what's your typical Friday night? And she said, going to a place where I can, like, a place with
00:50:51 good beer and a little personality where they play good music at a volume where you can have a
00:50:58 conversation over it. And I was like, where the hell did she find a place like this in Virginia
00:51:02 Beach? I even messaged, I messaged her and said, like, hi there, where did you find a place that
00:51:06 has all these characteristics in Virginia Beach? Haven't gotten a response yet, but I'm legitimately
00:51:10 curious. I'd love to go somewhere that has beers and decent music, you know, her musical tastes
00:51:16 seem more similar to mine than, you know, what's typical, which is why I don't go to bars. I love
00:51:22 the concept of a bar, go to a place, have them serve you awesome, interesting alcoholic beverages and
00:51:28 hang out with other people and listen to music, sounds great, except every bar just blasts shitty
00:51:34 music at the highest possible volume. And you can't talk to anybody. And, and I don't want to hear
00:51:40 that music. Would love to know these places these people are finding that I don't know about.
00:51:46 One girl had a bunch of pictures of her doing rock climbing on like legit cliffs. I was like,
00:51:50 where the fuck are you finding these cliffs in Virginia Beach? It's a flat plane. Are you driving
00:51:55 out to the mountains to do this? Real curiosity. So yeah, maybe everybody else knows a much more
00:52:03 fun and exciting version of this town than I do. That's, that's what I'm always suspecting, you know.
00:52:07 I mean, Ben St moved in and he thinks this place is hell. He was like, this, there's nothing to do
00:52:11 here. This place is just a wasteland. It's a hellhole. And I kept assuring him like, I know
00:52:17 there's stuff to do here, because other people who live here do stuff. Most people who live in
00:52:22 Virginia Beach seem to be happy here. Just the stuff that they do is not stuff I want to do.
00:52:26 Most people go to the beach. I don't like the beach. Most people go to clubs and bars don't
00:52:32 like clubs and bars. You know, there's a million clubs and bars in this town. There's definitely
00:52:38 things to do. I'm just not sure, you know, what they are where and a lot of them are expensive
00:52:44 things to do. You know, there's lots of like little fun. You could go canoeing out on the river.
00:52:48 You could go paddle boarding or something. You can go fishing. There's a lot of water here. There's
00:52:52 a lot of water based activities. There's hiking areas. There's ultimate frisbee golf and shit.
00:52:58 But all that's like, you know, you have to spend money to do on the end of that shit.
00:53:04 Indoor trampoline gyms and indoor rock climbing, bowling everywhere, laser tag, all things you
00:53:12 have to pay money for. So probably not something that I think Ben's more looking for like hipster
00:53:18 coffee shop I can sit down at, you know, or something. But I don't know. It's not a lot.
00:53:26 Not a lot that is of interest to me or seemingly him around here. So whatever everybody else is
00:53:33 doing, I'd love to know it. Love to know where they're going and why they find it appealing.
00:53:38 But personally, I can't say I understand it myself.
00:53:45 And that really makes me think, you know, I've been talking a lot about moving all the PCP here
00:53:50 to Virginia Beach. And the only real reason for it to be Virginia Beach over any where anybody
00:53:58 else lives is that I have the most, I have personally have the most stability in my income
00:54:04 and in housing situation. And I, you know, I've already got Ben and DeVue living here for like
00:54:10 really low rent compared to what it would be if we were trying to, you know, get our own place.
00:54:15 You know, and of course that rent is also split between my, both of my brothers and
00:54:22 Shade's girlfriend. So like, you know, it makes sense because we have a good housing situation
00:54:29 with good rent. And, you know, DeVue works for me anyways. So he's basically best wherever I am.
00:54:37 And, and like no one else, like we don't want to move out to where Jesse is because he lives in
00:54:42 the middle of bumfuck nowhere in a town even smaller than ours. You know, Nate lives in Ohio,
00:54:47 but he's not really from there. So even he's not really connected there. Because he's originally
00:54:52 from Michigan, which both Ben and Nate are both from not Michigan, I meant Massachusetts. Ben
00:54:59 and Nate are from like outside Boston. And Nate, I mean, Ben kind of misses where he was from.
00:55:04 But I do feel like we should eventually just move this whole operation. Like,
00:55:13 we, we moved into this house because my parents wanted to keep the house, you know, they wanted to,
00:55:18 they wanted to give us our own place while simultaneously not having to give up their
00:55:23 house. That was sort of the whole dream with getting the, with the whole setup we have right
00:55:28 now is don't have to sell the house that we've been living in for seven years and done all this
00:55:33 work on and, you know, don't have to uproot everybody and move them around. You know,
00:55:39 Shade's got his girlfriend who wants to stay around. Victor's got his girlfriend who wants to
00:55:43 stay around. They're not trying to like move out and get into all this other shit. But eventually,
00:55:49 Victor's going to probably move in with, with Hope. I don't know what Shade and Amber will do,
00:55:55 but like, I don't know if moving like, I want everyone in one place, but this doesn't have to
00:56:01 be the place because it really doesn't seem like Virginia Beach has anything to offer us.
00:56:05 And that's becoming more and more clear to me over time. We're like, for instance,
00:56:12 you know, even though my lifestyle has me indoors like all the time and not really talking to
00:56:17 anybody, I feel like there must be in other cities, people I could actually hang out with,
00:56:23 communities I could be a part of, you know, like people I could see in real life
00:56:28 or places I could go and do things, you know, if we lived in New York City or something,
00:56:33 which I don't know if I'd want to live in New York City because it's, you know,
00:56:36 grossly overpopulated and there's just too many, I don't want to live like surrounded on all sides
00:56:41 by people and things and sounds and shit, you know, there's anything I've learned from Casey
00:56:46 Neistat vlogs is that the sound pollution is terrible. You're constantly, there's always some
00:56:53 weird shit going on. Probably wouldn't be a great recording environment unless I like
00:56:59 created a whole fucking studio. But nonetheless, like, this maybe is not the place to keep this
00:57:08 going. It's a great place for getting everybody in one spot, but only for us to work together.
00:57:14 There's nothing outside of this group, you know, which I kind of always had it in my head that
00:57:19 that was okay, that like, well, we're all going to be working together. So we should all be,
00:57:23 you know, like, who else do we possibly need to talk to other than one another. But then it's
00:57:27 like, yeah, but what about the all the time you're not working, you know, that's the time I've kind
00:57:34 of left unaccounted for. And for a really long time, I had this like romantic idea in my head
00:57:40 of exploring everywhere in Virginia Beach, like, because I didn't, because I kind of saw myself
00:57:45 as like a spokesperson for the town, like I live here, it's important to me that I am a part of
00:57:51 this place, I grew up here, you know, I'm going to be the guy who represents the city or something,
00:57:57 or be the most interesting thing to come out of this town. And so I should explore it and find
00:58:03 out all that's here. And now I feel like I have and there's nothing here, you know, I feel like
00:58:07 I've done the exploring. I'm sure there's some stuff I haven't seen yet that's interesting, but like,
00:58:12 on a day to day basis, there's nothing here I want to be doing, you know, I've been to all the cool
00:58:17 restaurants, that's over, you know, I've been to all the the comic stores have been to all the game
00:58:24 shops and the record stores and the bookstores and all the things that interest me. And there's
00:58:30 there's not a whole lot left, I don't want to hang out down at the beach strip, where it's a
00:58:34 25 minute drive to everything being overpriced. And there's not as much down there as I first
00:58:39 thought. Like when I I used to think that like there's all this stuff down at the beach, and I
00:58:43 just haven't really gone down there. But then like I have driven around there, not really anything,
00:58:48 but bars and clubs. So, you know, maybe this town just isn't meant for the the procrastinators.
00:58:55 Maybe we're going to end up setting up base somewhere else. And I mean, like, we don't really
00:58:59 know where yet. So, you know, if I don't I don't want anybody to put down on a on a lease here
00:59:07 or something, and then get trapped in a house for a year, and then we're all kind of stuck.
00:59:12 But at the same time, I don't want us to just pack up and go to some other town without thinking
00:59:17 about it, you know. But especially if it's going to be even more expensive, which Virginia Beach
00:59:22 is not a cheap place to live. But if we're trying to move somewhere even cooler, then it just means
00:59:27 the rent's going to be even higher, you know. So, so I don't know where we could go that we could
00:59:32 all live in one place, and it would still be inexpensive, and also cool. But maybe we'll find
00:59:40 out. I certainly would like to. Alrighty, well, I think I'll just keep this one short, kind of stuck
00:59:49 to one topic, or at least one train of thought through the whole thing. So, you know, might as
00:59:55 well keep it as it is. It's a bit late anyways, a few days late. Maybe the next one will
01:00:02 not be a whole week before it comes out. Who knows? Who knows how much decompression I'll
01:00:06 have to do between now and then. I hope you enjoy the new song choice. I know it's a real
01:00:12 crowd pleaser, so you'll probably all be into it. And enjoy it, and have a nice day.
