00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best
00:00:12 guy ever. And today we're joined by Digilomatic Ben Saint. There he is. The slime I can hear
00:00:25 bubbling up deep within my veins. Munchy. Oh wow. What's now? You know. Oh wow. We've got
00:00:42 Tom. Tom Oliver. I'm here. Good. We've got. Oh, okay. We've got Letharora Mage. There's
00:00:54 a cat on my table, so excuse any cat noises. No furries allowed. The pussy is present. Yeah.
00:01:01 And begin the pussy jokes. And the digital booboo boy. There he is. Hey, I'm here. I'm
00:01:08 trying to recover my mind after a really intense 420 celebration slash Evangelion viewing party.
00:01:15 Oh God. It was 420 yesterday. Yeah. Indeed it was. Indeed it was. Did you see that thing
00:01:24 that I tweed you? A clip from Armored Shoebaccon 3 with a filter over a digi? Yes, I saw that.
00:01:29 I saw that. Very nice. It was looking good. But nothing about that. Oh shit. Where are they?
00:01:35 Where can we find animals? What are their culture? What can we learn from them? You can find
00:01:40 typical animal over on Dictionary Urban Dictionary.com. Dictionary Urban was my favorite
00:01:52 child detective novel as it's set on the mean streets of New York where Dictionary Urban. You
00:01:57 guys know what I'm fucking talking about? There was a cryptic, I remember that, yeah,
00:02:01 from that ancient children's book story. There was lots of mysterious clues left about dipping to
00:02:07 the whip and I had to open up my dictionary urban and find out what the fuck was going on in there.
00:02:13 Listen, this is terrible. Let's get down to our real shit. Is Nate breaking up or do my headphones
00:02:20 just suck dick? Your headphones suck dick. I bet you've got like a $5 one you'd be like oh this
00:02:25 will work. No, they were like 30 bucks and they're garbage. Anyway, I'm derailing. Let's fucking get
00:02:30 in that urban dictionary. The interest for the audience is Ben has been doing the PCP just by
00:02:34 turning his speakers real low this entire time. I've just been turning my speakers really low so
00:02:40 that my mic doesn't pick us up as an echo and it's worked brilliantly. None of you knew. None of
00:02:47 you knew. I fooled you all. You're not wrong. All right, here we go. UrbanDictionary.com. It's
00:02:53 furries, guys. Furries. So here is the top definition of furry. All right, here we go. This is a
00:03:00 fucking literary piece on this. Furry. There is no piece for you. There is no one single definition
00:03:09 of what a furry is. Even within the furry fandom, people cannot always agree on just what makes a
00:03:15 person a furry or not. Okay, so this guy's breaking it down. Some would argue that to be a furry,
00:03:19 you must think and talk like one, i.e. use furry specific words and phrases. Even if you go to
00:03:25 conventions, wear a food fursuit, draw the art, write the stories, etc., but don't talk using furry
00:03:31 lingo. This is one of those things where only within that community would they even... Would there even
00:03:37 be a question? Yeah, for any outsider, it's just like, do you have any interest whatsoever in
00:03:43 watching animalized stuff? It's like my old standby. It's like I always say, I may be attracted to
00:03:52 robots, you know, have had sex with a robot, fucked a robot in its tailpipe, you know, be married
00:03:57 to a robot and be exclusively interested in robots sexually, but at least I'm not a goddamn robo-file.
00:04:04 Unlike some people. I scroll down and like so many of these definitions of furry are like
00:04:12 incredibly extensive on Urban Dictionary. Because they're all in there trying to do PR damage
00:04:19 control. A constant state, a decades long state of society-wide damage control. There's a simpler
00:04:30 one here. I just skipped, some of these are short. Listen, furry, simply one who has interest, small
00:04:36 or large of anthropomorphic animals, animals who have animal colonies, be it simply talking or
00:04:42 having a human-like body. The next one, in the same one it says, one who has interest in
00:04:48 anthropomorphic animals, does not mean wanting to have sex with them. What do you mean it doesn't,
00:04:53 they don't want to have sex with them? That's wrong. This is just incorrect. It's like saying that
00:05:00 bronies don't want to fuck show people. It's the exact same correlation, the exact same thing is
00:05:07 like, bronies don't clop, it's not sexual. As hard as it is to believe- As hard as it is to believe,
00:05:16 this is an extremely poorly worded entry on UrbanDictionary.com. To say that it does not mean
00:05:23 wanting to have sex with them, it implies that it means inherently a furry does not want to have
00:05:28 sex when the fact is you can or cannot. It doesn't define whether or not you're- Is that true?
00:05:35 Is that true? Is what true? They're furries who don't want to have sex with animals.
00:05:40 Do furries exist who go to conventions where fursuits but have no desire to-
00:05:45 Yes, absolutely. Of course there is. Is that true? Yes. Okay. I bet the proportion of
00:05:51 asexuals in the furry community is astronomical. I don't believe in asexuals, but okay, go on.
00:05:57 Okay, okay, let's say our stances, let's say our stances, because this is-
00:06:00 You heard me. You may think- What if you just- Nate, that doesn't make any sense, but okay.
00:06:08 I think everyone who says they're asexual is fooling themselves. That's what I-
00:06:11 What about- What if you don't have sex, then what? What's your counter-argument to that?
00:06:17 Are we describing it as a thing that you do or like a state of mind, like a personality trait?
00:06:22 Are we talking about- Oh, fucking hell.
00:06:24 People who don't want to have sex don't exist? Are we talking about that?
00:06:28 Are we talking about literally munchy? Okay, we'll get back to this. We'll get back to the
00:06:33 asexuality question. I hope we don't.
00:06:37 All right, munchy, you have some experience with furries in the world. I do.
00:06:43 Tell us your tale. Tell us your stories. And mind your words.
00:06:48 Oh, I will. My stance, my angle that will be integral to this entire episode, here's my position.
00:06:55 Furries were a joke. They were just a fucking meme that you would punctuate friendly conversation
00:07:00 with your friends with. It would be like, oh, you know, I'm getting a sick frag. I'm killing a
00:07:04 zombie right through his goddamn head. Oh, this is just like what I would do to a furry if I were
00:07:08 to see him on the streets. And it was a great time. It was an excellent time. And then due to
00:07:17 circumstances too unlawful and sinful to recreate or reproduce with my words, I was thrusts into
00:07:23 situations where I would be able to not be able to. I was forced to examine furry culture
00:07:29 and lifestyles on like a every other day basis. And it made me realize,
00:07:36 wait a second, furries are real and not like a fictional construct made to make other people
00:07:44 laugh at what furries are. And so I had to like examine the furry culture for a while on Twitter.
00:07:52 On Twitter, I made a tweet about how I was going to try and become a furry. And by that I just meant
00:07:57 join furry discords and see what they do. Not to bully, not to bully, but to understand, you know,
00:08:03 like, like, what's this all about? What's going on here? And I have come back with the data. The
00:08:08 data is that I am a fucking genius and that furries are all terrible except for the furries that are
00:08:15 great, which are all of them because all furries are great. And I'm a fucking faggot except for
00:08:20 the ones that are shit. And I'm so conflicted and nuanced. I'm so nuanced. Kill me. I want to,
00:08:27 I just want to go back to furries being jokes. I wish they were jokes again. I don't want to think
00:08:32 about them. Dude, this guy got, this guy got nuanced out the ass. This guy got achieved maximum over
00:08:37 nuance. I got strapped. I can't even, I begged my fucking daddy not let me walk and then he
00:08:44 lowered me up with his nuanced knowledge. That's what fucking happened right now.
00:08:48 So yeah, needless to say, like, there's things going on. There's things going on these days as
00:08:56 society progresses and more degenerate elements of society are able to survive on the backs of
00:09:03 people who can actually do things with their lives. Like, like all this kind of shit is just
00:09:08 getting more and more prevalent. You know, what's, what's the deal? How do we, how do we end them
00:09:13 once and for all? Let's go through all our stances. I mean, do you, do you guys all have the lay
00:09:18 queries are bad? No, I, but a little bit. I'm pretty, no, but kind of ambivalent. My position
00:09:25 is pure ambivalence. I don't, I don't care for it too much. And in fact, I find a lot of the
00:09:32 aesthetic to be pretty, pretty unappealing. Like, like I've, I've seen, I know people who are furry,
00:09:39 so I've seen lots of art and like, how can you not see furry art when you're on the internet?
00:09:43 And like, I'm definitely much more and like, not into it sexually at all, obviously, but, but in
00:09:49 terms of like the aesthetic of like anthropomorphized animals, I definitely swing more towards like,
00:09:54 I like the like Disney sort of thing where it's like, like the classic Disney movies where they
00:09:59 add like humanoid features to animals, but like the weird like furry art where it's like a human
00:10:04 with like paws, that like creeps me out when like it's uncanny valley. Yeah, I'm talking about like,
00:10:10 so, so you prefer that, that like Lion King moment where Nala looks at Simba. Oh, so sexually.
00:10:16 Those aren't even fun. Lion King's not even a furry movie. They're just animals. Yeah. Well,
00:10:22 where's the, that's a good question. Where is the little anthropomorphized? I mean,
00:10:27 I mean, literally your movie sucks. Like that's his third favorite movie on the basis of he wants
00:10:33 to fuck Scar. So like, I would say it's a furry movie on some of them. Wait, wait, why? No, it might
00:10:39 be a movie with furry appeal. It might be a movie with furry appeal, but those characters are, I was
00:10:45 saying the Lion King, the YMS considers that his third favorite movie out of his desire to fuck
00:10:52 Scar. Well, you know, unlike YMS, why? Because he's getting the furry before he is a before, you
00:10:58 know, Hitler liked painting. That doesn't mean that painting is a Nazi thing. You know what I'm
00:11:04 saying? Yeah, just because YMS likes to fuck Scar doesn't mean I can also want to fuck Scar. Yeah,
00:11:09 you know, yeah, he could not be labeled a damn dirty furry, you know what I'm saying. Get ready
00:11:13 for this hot JoJo reference. It's like just because Kira from part four of JoJo finds the Mona
00:11:19 Lisa's hands incredibly sexual. Well, I mean, no, not really. It's just that like the bad guy does
00:11:26 find Mona Lisa's hands like overtly sexual and arousing. But that doesn't mean that like it's
00:11:32 an erotic image inherently, like this is him bringing that to the table. Sure, you can convert
00:11:37 anything to any degree if you try hard enough. People have people up there, you know, sexual
00:11:42 all right, guys, indeed, we're kind of getting we're getting off. When are we going to get
00:11:47 poly procrastinators? When are you gonna get like, like, like, like, like polygrams? No,
00:11:53 you mean shipping subreddit? That's what I mean. Oh, you mean like between us? Yeah. Oh,
00:12:01 that's why I'm not surprised it hasn't happened right now. Yeah, I'm sure it hasn't happened.
00:12:06 You have set it in motion. We're not. We're not sexy. We're we're losers, you guys.
00:12:14 I don't know what you're talking about. You know, gay. Yeah. Okay, okay. Here's some facts. 99%
00:12:23 of all procrastinators fans are transsexual. Another one percent are gay. There are no other
00:12:31 do the graphics. That is all basis. That is truer, like, like you say that as a joke, but yeah,
00:12:37 it's true. No, that's actually the truth. Yeah, I know, I know. I mean, I mean, I'm sure there's
00:12:44 there's a lot of trans people. No, no, no, 99% and 1% those are the only those are the only
00:12:49 percentage, you know, there are rounds, which is strange why why we would choose to be you know,
00:12:54 you know, I'm so glad that the privileged class of trans of trans women have, you know,
00:13:00 have thrown their lot in as allies of the, you know, of the downtrodden PCP, you know,
00:13:05 we need the famous alt-right comedy. You know, it shows a lot of magnanimity.
00:13:16 Well, we're having a great time. Stop that. We got to talk about.
00:13:23 All right. Yeah, let's continue this expressing our general thoughts on furry. So here's my thing,
00:13:29 and this will not surprise anybody, but I, everyone, anyone who's like judgmental of what
00:13:35 somebody is into sexually can just fuck off and die. I actually am probably way more,
00:13:41 I wouldn't say that I'm pro furry, but I'm 100% pro freedom to do whatever the hell you want.
00:13:46 I'm pro bestiality. I'm ironically, there's, there is an argument to make there, I suppose,
00:13:54 but I am like, I'm a pro bee ball. I'm a pro bee ball. I know you guys on several,
00:14:01 some people here, I don't remember exactly who have argued with me. I've debated that like,
00:14:05 yeah, if you're like a furry, and you go to conventions, dress up in a fur suit, like,
00:14:09 okay, like that's a little strange to me, like it's not something I would do. But as long as you
00:14:13 continue to be a productive human being, and it's like something that you do just out of fun,
00:14:17 then I don't see a problem. But if you stop being productive, if you put that pick down and stop
00:14:23 mining for slime, then you're going, you're done. If you, if you start to become like, if you start
00:14:29 to be like a dependent, and you start to like be like, Oh no, I need to spend all my money to like
00:14:34 make myself feel okay about the fact that I'm a furry by getting like increasingly elaborate
00:14:38 fur suits, or buying all this porn supporting these artists. So of course, mom and dad, I need
00:14:42 you to pay my rent for me so I can like, I'm not saying that furries do this, but like if somebody
00:14:47 has that attitude about anything, that's a problem. That's not a furry problem. That's being a broken,
00:14:53 irresponsible human being. Okay, okay. This is the thing. All of my complaints with furries are all
00:15:00 in character for me and not relate to like the core of what a furry is. Nothing has to do with
00:15:05 like the animal side of it. It all is in character complaints that I've complained about in other
00:15:10 situations before that all culminate in this fandom. It's not inherent to all members of the
00:15:15 fandom, but, but why should we ignore? Why should we ignore outliers? Why should we ignore the face
00:15:21 of the fandom? Why should we know? That's an excellent point. And like, you know, for example,
00:15:26 bronies as a group, as a movement, get lambasted because many of them, maybe not even a majority,
00:15:32 but many of them are obnoxious and annoying. So like in the same way, like, have you seen
00:15:37 Foam Adventure? That famous- Yes, of course. Of course, I've seen Foam Adventure. That's a legendary
00:15:43 video. I wish I liked anything. I wish I liked anything as much as they liked their foam.
00:15:50 I was a little judge, honestly. I like Foam Adventure as much as they liked their foam.
00:15:56 It's just, it's just the tale, if you haven't seen it, it would probably be in the show notes,
00:15:58 but like it's just the, it's a day adventure of two furries going out to get foam in order to make
00:16:04 fursuits when they, when they come back home. Is that what it was for? Yes. Yeah, I thought they
00:16:07 just wanted to like roll around on it. No, no, no, it's for fursuit. That was just a side benefit.
00:16:12 Okay. So they needed it for something. Well, all right. And like, they don't like do,
00:16:19 they don't hurt anybody. They're not really that annoying. It's just when you just,
00:16:22 when you witness this little slice of their lives and you imagine being like,
00:16:26 within three feet of them, it's just like, oh no. Imagine living like this or adjacent to this.
00:16:33 But the thing is though, with me, I'm not trying to land best furries or anything. It's just that like,
00:16:37 a lot of it just seems childish to me. It seems very like whimsical. Like, yeah, we're going to do
00:16:43 this crazy thing. Oh, okay. I completely agree. Does anyone else want to give their stance? Does
00:16:48 anyone fucking, does anyone care? I can go. Okay. Yeah. What do you think, did you?
00:16:54 Well, as, as we were all in the Brony community, obviously there's plenty of overlap between that
00:17:00 and the furry community. Yes. And, you know, I know a whole bunch of people from that community
00:17:06 who are furries, especially from being on the pub crawl, because like pub crawl has always been
00:17:13 like a, on some, on some level, somehow it's always been a furry show, I feel like.
00:17:20 I didn't know that. Okay. I mean, like Cider is heavily affiliated with the furry community,
00:17:25 and a lot of the guests we had on there would be into that stuff. And because like,
00:17:29 the nature of the show early on was we got shitfaced and talked about like weird,
00:17:35 like laws and stuff. Like we were always talking about things like what animals are surprisingly
00:17:40 legal to fucking what states.
00:17:47 Gee, that's not a red flag that it's a furry show. I don't know what it is.
00:17:51 And I mean, obviously we, well, I mean, during the pub crawl, we would have somebody in the chat
00:17:57 who just would routinely every show, which is constantly post pony porn, you know,
00:18:03 and like, we were all okay with that because we saw it as like, this is a real outsider program
00:18:08 here. Like this is not, you know, we're not expecting anybody who can't handle pony porn
00:18:12 to be listening to the fucking pub crawl, which was like a 2am show on an obscure pony network,
00:18:18 you know, but like, as a result, I ended up talking to, you know, just like hearing
00:18:24 second hand. And it's amazing how much of it is just like furry to me, furriness,
00:18:30 there's like a whole culture is next to godliness, you know, it really is. There's definitely like,
00:18:35 I think to them they are almost another, well, another species in a way, but like,
00:18:41 more like another race of people, like they like furries act the way that like, you know,
00:18:48 when you go to like a rest, like an Asian restaurant or something, and like the family
00:18:53 who runs the place are all like talking in Chinese and making fun of you, because you
00:18:57 can't speak Chinese, that's how I feel around furries. It's like, they've devised their own
00:19:02 language, and they're kind of like, making fun of every like, you know, there's like, whatever,
00:19:06 we're over here, like, we're using our language so you guys can't understand us, or we're like,
00:19:11 in our own other world, you know, but like, it's mostly a sex thing.
00:19:16 So what you're telling me, Digi, is that, so these people are not exactly human, and my
00:19:22 loyalties are intense, but extend only to human. So, and since they're furries, and they identify
00:19:27 outside the normal human spectrum, they're more bestial, they wouldn't mind, they wouldn't object
00:19:31 if I put them down like a dog, is what you're telling me. That's, that's my, ends on the kink,
00:19:35 I guess. I certainly wouldn't mind. So, but there is a distinction to be, or, I mean, I'm asking,
00:19:44 I guess, because I'm not really an expert. So like, furry, yeah. Furry is not equal to otherkin,
00:19:49 is not equal to like, someone who's intubitial. If we, if we're, if otherkin, if otherkin's
00:19:54 part of this, that just, I mean, so many memories, so many memories of trolling otherkin. It was a
00:20:00 great time in my life. That's like, I mean, I, I mean, I don't, I mean, I imagine that the otherkin
00:20:07 percentage number is higher in the furry fandom, though it's not an integral part to it. There was
00:20:12 the time, there was the time I pretended to be the meta, the metatron, like reincarnated and talked
00:20:17 about and gaining literal superpowers and was like, hey guys, I'm gaining literal superpowers
00:20:22 because my angelic power is manifesting. There was the time I was a mind flayer. There was the time
00:20:27 I was a mind flayer. There was the time that I was the spirit of my own fat and I was also a feeder
00:20:33 who was determined to become as fat as possible because I identified so strongly with the, no,
00:20:38 it was on likeotherkinforums.com or whatever it was back in like 2010.
00:20:43 Okay, okay. Damn.
00:20:44 Unnerve me, I don't particularly like them, especially like fictional other people where,
00:20:50 and like, there's like the subculture of people who take other people's OCs and kin with them
00:20:56 and it's super uncomfortable. Oh my god. There's, there's copyright issues there,
00:20:59 guys. Jay, I just got to pay to play. Like that guy who was kin to like that one Digimon character
00:21:05 from season two, like the blue haired guy. That's not even, that's not even like, that's like
00:21:09 kinning with a show, but like, I mean, like taking people like such as like, let's say me or like
00:21:15 any other creator that they don't have anything published or whatever. They're just one person
00:21:19 on the internet. They take their character and they kin with them. Well, now, Maj, is your,
00:21:24 is your complaint there on more of a, I don't know, I'm not trying to dig into it, but like, is it,
00:21:28 is it more of like a, like a, this is your character. What right does this person have to like,
00:21:33 define themselves by a character that, frankly, they don't even know, because it's not their
00:21:36 character? Like, why would they do that? Or does anyone ever really know anyone?
00:21:41 It's kind of like that, but also like, my characters are in a way also a small extension
00:21:47 of myself. Like they don't necessarily represent myself. They might not have anything in common
00:21:52 with me, but they are a part of me. Like I put a little bit of myself in them, you know, and like
00:21:57 then someone takes my character and then assumes them and then like,
00:22:02 So if someone, if someone kins to a character of yours that is an extension of you, that's
00:22:06 basically rape at that point. So we got to, we got to tap down on this across the board.
00:22:10 Literally, literally, literally. Yeah, you're right.
00:22:13 It just makes me really uncomfortable. Like it hasn't happened to me, but it has happened to
00:22:17 a few artists I follow. And it's just like the thought idea is just, is just really uncomfortable
00:22:21 to me. I mean, that's a fair point. But aren't there people who other kin as like, not even like
00:22:25 dead people, but living people, like I personally am a Kanye West kin. I feel, I feel, you know,
00:22:31 a con kin for sure. If I, if I bought into the whole kin thing, I don't understand people who
00:22:38 kin with people who are still alive because I thought the whole idea is like reincarnation or
00:22:43 whatever. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe these people don't believe in the linear progression of time.
00:22:48 So that being said, they could be a reincarnation. Just like how there's theories that every electron
00:22:53 in the universe is the same electron. No, they must, they must be adherence to my,
00:22:56 to my famous church of transubstantiation, wherein a single spirit is reborn throughout
00:23:01 time and space as every individual living thing that ever existed. Time means nothing to a
00:23:06 transubstantialist like myself. You know, major's right. If that's true, then we're all just kin
00:23:12 of everybody. And that's, oh my God. Yes, it's true. It's true. Yes, we're all kin. We're all kin.
00:23:17 It's not, Ben, Ben. So it's, at that point, Ben, it's not other kin. It's every kin. We are the,
00:23:24 we are the Omni-kin. Oh, yeah. This is the word for this, but you're not, that's the name. That's
00:23:30 the name for this one universal spirit that reincarnates. It is the Omni-kin because it is
00:23:34 kin to all fictional and non-fictional alike. Wait, wait, wait, stop, but you crossed the line.
00:23:39 No, no, we're going right in this train all the way to the station. Well, I guess, I guess if we
00:23:44 include the multiverse theory as a part of that, then it is literally every character. And of course
00:23:48 we do. Of course we do. But then technically nothing is fictional. So the problem's off.
00:23:52 In the nation, you can be kin with anyone that you want. That's ever existed.
00:23:57 Yeah. And so you shall, and so it shall be. Amen. Well, okay, all right. Let's focus back on
00:24:04 furries. Now, I want to ask, like, so we said before, there is a distinction between a furry
00:24:10 and like an other kin, but like, what is going on with a furry who dresses up in a fur suit?
00:24:16 Like, what is, what's going on there? What's the deal? What do you mean?
00:24:20 They would like to have sex in the suit made of fur. Is that because they feel like they
00:24:28 are that creature or is it that they just like to pretend? I mean, there is a difference there.
00:24:33 Like, I know a few people and like, from them personal experience, nothing all furries, but
00:24:38 from them is just, it's kind of like cosplay in a way. They just like to dress up and,
00:24:43 you know, go to conventions and have a good time. Well, that makes sense to me.
00:24:47 I scoffed at this as you should scoff at this because I, I have a small sample source and I
00:24:54 don't even believe what I'm about to say. But I have been told that it is a sort of performance
00:25:00 art in the sense that they assume a character with a costume and then they portray this character
00:25:06 at conventions. It's not inherently sex thing. There are actually different types of fur suits
00:25:11 that are, it's like, if you were to watch the footage of like YMS will go to furry conventions
00:25:19 and like just take a bunch of footage and post it on his side channel. And yeah, like the fur
00:25:25 suitors always seem to be putting on like a cool cat-esque like character of like over the top,
00:25:32 you know, like kids show, hey, I'm a big fur suit man. Like we're going to run this convention
00:25:40 and it's going to be a great, uh, convention into the ground. Are you saying that YMS is
00:25:45 attracted to cool cat? That's not impossible. That is like, it does not look too different from
00:25:51 your normal fur suits. Well, I know that YMS identifies as a horse, but he is interested in
00:25:57 big cats. This is some deep lore that I'm not aware of. Well, that's fine. I mean, this is all
00:26:04 very strange, but like, I just want to, like, all the weird porn I watch is pretty strange too.
00:26:10 So I, I don't know, in no way am I trying to disrespect Adam or like anybody who's a furry
00:26:14 out there. It just, you know, it's interesting and funny. I only know all these things because I,
00:26:19 like, part of why I got into YMS was that I was really fascinated that he was an openly gay furry
00:26:25 and willing to talk about it like very matter of factly. Like, yeah, why the fuck do I care?
00:26:29 And I was just like, yeah. Are there any other big name furries out there? Who else is a
00:26:32 representative of a community? I can't, I can't think of any like, respectables. I can't think
00:26:38 of any of the people. I know. I mean, yeah, I have lots of friends who are in the furry community
00:26:42 and people who are like, I know, but nobody who's like giant, nobody who's as big as, as YMS.
00:26:50 Yeah, I guess, I guess, I guess all the big, all the big furries are just big in their little
00:26:53 puns. I, I want, I want, I need, I feel like I feel the need to separate church and state
00:26:58 you real quick because if we, if we, I just want to put the kibosh on this real quick. Being a
00:27:04 furry does not inherently mean that you are sexually attracted to furry creatures. Now,
00:27:08 on that side of that, that's not a huge part, right? But I just feel the need to separate that
00:27:12 because I have no problem with the sexual component of it. Okay, I'm going to level
00:27:18 this through real quick. If furries were just a cult of, of red robed, you know,
00:27:23 Luminati fucking, you know, Burning Man type cultish freaks whose soul, you know, a tenant of
00:27:31 their, of their personality and religion is that they love to fuck like turtles. I would have no
00:27:36 problem. My, my, my problem. And when I, I should specify my problem is my, my specific, I don't like
00:27:43 them opinion, opinion, like danger, like red alert, Lee Sirens opinion, uh, is with their culture
00:27:49 and their culture is truly disgusting to me for in-character reasons that have been honed outside
00:27:55 of the furry fandom. Yeah. We've been, we've been magnanimous and, and dancing around the issue,
00:28:00 but let, I want to get into the shit. I want to weigh into the, the, the, the, I wanted to bring
00:28:05 up, it was funny that Munchie mentioned, uh, Burning Man because Dick always tells us, uh, Dick,
00:28:10 of the dick show. So it's the story of, uh, going to Burning Man and going to see the furry
00:28:14 tent. And it was like the only one that was like this fully realized, like the almost futuristic,
00:28:20 like technology tent where they had like built an entire hut with like TV and they'd gotten
00:28:26 cable and shit out there. Like it was just an orgy dome. Like it was just a place where they
00:28:30 like literally would just have a gigantic furry orgies. However, they had the best and like most
00:28:37 fully realized tent at Burning Man because the furries are, are, are geniuses. And, uh,
00:28:43 they're an entrepreneurial community. I really do think that furries, first, I don't know what
00:28:47 the connection is. There seems to be some connection between furries and engineering. And like that.
00:28:53 Yes. I've noticed this too. Because the, because the suits maybe, because they're complicated.
00:28:56 I, I think it's probably just they're both things that nerds do.
00:29:01 That's definitely a huge part of it. And I gotta tell you, I was just at this convention called,
00:29:06 called Torah Khan, which is at the Rochester Institute of Technology, really huge engineering
00:29:11 school that's been around for, for like a hundred years or something. However, they've been around
00:29:15 forever. They have, they're, you know, pres, fairly prestigious, but they have a gigantic
00:29:20 anime convention, like a 3,500 person con at the school. And it's because the school has enough
00:29:28 of a weeb population that there's not only nearby the best manga store I've ever been to,
00:29:33 with it like a block away from the school. One of the best tabletop game stores I've ever seen
00:29:39 in my life, like within a block of the school, like everyone at the school is a fucking nerd.
00:29:44 And while we were there, not only are there furries in fursuits all over the school,
00:29:49 like, like think about this, these people go to school here, like almost everybody at this
00:29:53 convention is somebody who goes to school here. And yet they are willing to walk around in fursuits,
00:29:59 like in front of everyone they know, because the school is just so full of nerds and there's such
00:30:06 a huge furry population. Well, that's true. I mean, they were all hanging out just among the
00:30:12 crowds. Well, okay, we're talking about a school that has like, like, uh, dive, like diversity
00:30:18 and inclusion, like messages everywhere. But the moment that really got to me was even like,
00:30:22 we're at a convention and there's furries everywhere, whatever. But I saw that this,
00:30:27 there were posters up for a cosplay formal dance. This school has cosplay formal dances,
00:30:35 and it depicted in the picture, like two, two, like a couple of like anime drawn characters,
00:30:41 like in, in, you know, gowns, like dancing, and they both have cat or they both have tiger ears,
00:30:47 because the school's mascot is a tiger. So all of their like branding, they just have like anime
00:30:52 characters with tiger ears as like their mascot characters. So it's just a furry school is basically
00:30:58 what I'm saying. Here's a question. If I, uh, if I own a local coffee shop and I observe a pack of
00:31:08 furries walking into my establishment, here's my question. If I refuse to serve them and demand
00:31:14 they leave immediately, uh, because they're creeping out me and everyone else around me,
00:31:19 not that this has happened. I'm just saying in a hypothetical, uh, is it a human rights issue?
00:31:24 Yes, of course. But, but, but they are not human. They are subhuman, you might say. These are furries.
00:31:30 They do not, you know, they don't fit. Uh, that's, that's my joke. Okay. That's the whole extent of
00:31:35 it. All right. But anyways, what were we getting into here? Oh yeah, Munchie. Munchie was gonna,
00:31:40 was gonna go into his deep hole. I want to give one final last disclaimer, not for the audience,
00:31:45 but for you guys, because I, I have been trying to be, you know, you know, passe and be nuanced
00:31:51 and be, you know, you know, I'm trying to put on the kid gloves and say, you know, you know,
00:31:55 I'm trying, I've been trying to defend furries. I will continue to defend furries, but make no
00:31:59 mistake. All of you are fucking idiots because I hate furries more than you could ever, ever
00:32:07 possibly understand. And I hate them for, for, for, for nuanced and on point reasons. My reasons
00:32:15 are on fucking- The furries are calling right now, dude. They've got a problem with this. They,
00:32:20 they want to talk to the manager. The phones are ringing off the hook. So, so, so while you guys
00:32:25 are being like, oh, fucking aren't whales gross or fuck you if you'd like horses. I'm over here
00:32:32 with the real fucking raw actual shit. Point one of why you would actually hate furries,
00:32:38 aka, it's my opinion, and I'll have like a reveal later and it will be narratively catharsis and
00:32:45 coon, coon, spheric. Point number one. Okay. This, obviously, the sex and not as in like, not,
00:32:53 not as in the like, you know, I want to fuck a horse. That's completely fine. That's completely
00:32:57 fine. Go, go at them. What I dislike is the openness. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna coin this term
00:33:04 that will be used at the entire thing. Unearned smothering kinship. So this is unearned smothering
00:33:12 kinship where, when you were part of a community, keep in mind, I've prowled furry forms, you know,
00:33:17 I, I, I've brought in the work. I've done the fucking work. This is true. The furrio stereotype
00:33:23 is not inaccurate and it is true. The, the, the sense of like, it's, it's like the Ben and Jackie
00:33:30 College fund. You enter, you, you, you enter, everyone's super nice. Everyone's super like
00:33:35 unbelievable, like, touchy and like, feeling one another and everything's soft. And it's,
00:33:39 it's this feeling that I've described over and over again throughout this podcast. It's when
00:33:43 you're in bed and you're in, you're in bed, it's winter. You want to get nice and cozy.
00:33:47 Then after a while and you're in your hop and you're like, this is too hot. This is too much.
00:33:51 Like I need to get, I don't have the covers. I need to be cool. I can't be in this fucking
00:33:56 softy, this fucking touchy, this feely, too up in, too up in my fucking grill, this cobbling,
00:34:02 fucking overheating, a din, this cesspool of sex and fucking villainy, the openness that these
00:34:09 people have to do, to do lewd and perverse and, and not even just like strictly destructive, but
00:34:14 like, like, nay, I think I'm trying, I'm struggling to come up with the words, but like, you understand
00:34:20 like, like how niceness, I know exactly what you're talking about. And well, the problem with,
00:34:25 the problem with communities of inclusivity is that to some degree, humans are both physically
00:34:30 and mentally, we're designed to be beasts of burden and we are expected to have psychological
00:34:35 loads and not have just everybody say how great and wonderful we are all the time. We're pack hunters.
00:34:41 Well, whatever, you know, we followed our many umbrellas here, but, but here's my point. Like,
00:34:48 the reason I prefer to hang out in communities that are like overtly in the opposite direction,
00:34:52 like on 4chan, where everyone is incredibly vicious and cruel to each other is because I just see more,
00:34:58 like, usefulness to come from that as opposed to people just placating me all day about like,
00:35:02 you're perfect just the way you are, there's no need to improve, like, and like, there's an,
00:35:06 that's of course important in some measures, like we want to not shame people for just being weird
00:35:11 or different, but to say that like every choice, now back to how much we hate furries, being a furry
00:35:17 is a fine thing to do. But if you walk around in a fur suit and people know who you are,
00:35:22 all I'm saying is I am not casting judgment, but I am telling you, there will be social
00:35:26 ramifications of doing so. Yeah, you'll have a lot of great sex with like-minded furry people.
00:35:31 That's that's what you have to look for too. Congratulations. Did you speak on the subject
00:35:36 because I want to know if you're, I mean, more on the openness about the sex thing. That's what I
00:35:42 care about. It's like really, it's really, yeah, it's intense, like, furries because of the fact
00:35:48 that they have that culture of like, understanding each other, I guess, um, yes, like, it's the
00:35:55 over the window dude. It's because it's because they can do, you know, it is definitely over to
00:36:01 windows. Yeah, they're all freaks and they allow themselves to do degenerate things. And so the
00:36:06 overall, like, you know, how, how much can you touch your friend? How, how much, you know, how,
00:36:12 how much weird flirting can you do? All dialogue, all dialogue between furries is
00:36:20 flirty. It's all, it's all. Yeah, in my experience, that is true.
00:36:25 Yo, yo, let's listen to this. Okay. Here's, here's the real shit. There's a word that I think that
00:36:30 has been lost to the ages a little bit. And I think it is such an important word. I don't know,
00:36:35 maybe people would disagree, but the word is classy. I like things that are classy. And you
00:36:40 know what? In my humble opinion, what is not classy is like talking overtly about sex, open,
00:36:46 like you're involved with it all the time, digi, like bring up sex when it's not relevant. And
00:36:51 like, like, it's, it's, you, you are allowed to do it. You are, it's fine. It's not a problem.
00:36:56 But I don't want to hear about it. I'm not interested in how much sex you are having,
00:37:02 like the weird things you get up. One time, like a neighbor of mine, when I was growing up,
00:37:06 like I asked her for a ride home, just told me like, I can't give her a ride home. I'm going
00:37:10 to a threesome. That happened to me in my real life. I would have said the same damn thing if I
00:37:15 was going to a threesome. I mean, that was totally fine. But like, you got to think, what was she
00:37:20 trying to do? She was like trying to like shock me or something, because she knew I was a fucking
00:37:25 gay ass twink. Like she could have said, I'm just busy. She chose to tell me she's going to a threesome.
00:37:31 She wants to brag about getting to go to a threesome.
00:37:34 Don't get me wrong. That's totally fine. And I, again, I respect her right to do so.
00:37:38 All I'm saying is classiness. Her classiness took a hit when she told me that. That's, that's,
00:37:44 that's all I'm saying. I have no attraction to the classiness that you speak of. I can tell.
00:37:48 I have no, I just, I don't, if you're, but it comes to like sexual stuff, I feel like, I mean,
00:37:55 you, I know you agree with me that like, we need to be more open about sexuality for our,
00:38:02 for our culture's sake. And I don't like, I do think that maybe the furries are like an over
00:38:07 extension of that. And I'm sure that has to do a lot with the fact that there's probably a fucking
00:38:13 near one to one autism ratio in the community. I've done the numbers. It is high. It is not
00:38:20 more than half, but it is high. Okay. I am on Nate's side. Like, I don't, I don't like on solicitors
00:38:26 at TMI about your sex life. Well, did you, did you is right though? I definitely agree that I
00:38:31 think society as a whole will be better off once we're at this place. But it's just that,
00:38:36 it's just that right now was like, there is a difference in your face about it.
00:38:41 I mean, that, that's true. I mean, I like, if, if we lived like, like fucking Star Trek, for
00:38:46 example, like there are just planets you can go to, like on earth, like people are relatively
00:38:50 conservative about these things. But if you go to like literally like the sex planet in Star Trek,
00:38:54 like it's like, then you can just talk about fucking anything you want all the time.
00:39:00 If there is, let's say a furry convention and the furry convention is just a big orgy,
00:39:06 I'm okay with that because it's just a bunch of furries, like everyone's going there knowing
00:39:09 what it is. There's definitely something weird about, for instance, at BronyCon, where every
00:39:15 year I would hear that there is somewhere a BronyCon orgy, like every year at BronyCon and
00:39:23 some hotel room nearby, a bunch of furries get together and have a huge orgy. And this is like,
00:39:29 this is something you hear about like floating over the crowds at BronyCon. And you see people,
00:39:35 you see furries like, you know, in fursuits with shirts like down to Yiff and shit like that.
00:39:43 It's brazenly sexual on some level. And then you're like, but this is a My Little Pony convention
00:39:49 where like, there's also six year old girls around. And it's like-
00:39:53 Well, okay, did you-
00:39:54 To a certain degree.
00:39:55 There are also six year olds at furry conventions.
00:39:58 Well, I mean, okay, you're not wrong. I want to speak on-
00:40:01 Some six year olds are furries and want to get into that orgy, I guess.
00:40:05 Like there's definitely some crossover between like, for example, like the gay rights movement
00:40:10 and stuff. Because like a lot of it is, it's about like being proud of who you are and like,
00:40:14 not allowing society to like, shame you and repress you. But like, I mean, you know, again,
00:40:18 there's a context for everything and there's degrees of doing different things. And like,
00:40:22 if you're at like a gay pride parade, like there's kind of, you're making a statement,
00:40:26 if you just like make out, if you're a guy and you're gay and you just make out with a dude
00:40:29 publicly, and it's like sloppy and just like, like just celebrating being gay, like that actually
00:40:34 has kind of like some utility. It's like, you're like challenging social norms and stuff. And so
00:40:39 like, I get it. I mean, and you know, now it's legal. So like, things have changed and it's
00:40:42 starting to get a little passe. So how about we shut the fuck up about that?
00:40:46 I'm just kidding. But like,
00:40:50 I'm just kidding everyone. Come on.
00:40:54 It's like taking potshots at all the fucking quote unquote repressed groups. So he's just like,
00:40:58 I got a really flag. I am currently defending all of them by saying that I totally understand
00:41:03 the desire to like, feel that you can express your sexuality just in general. And I think,
00:41:08 I think just that leads to a little bit of overcompensation is all I'm saying. Again,
00:41:13 like I agree with you guys on all of this. I think there's, there's a lot of like, I feel
00:41:17 shame. So I'm going to hyper like accentuate this in response, which is logical to a degree.
00:41:22 Sure. I think that the same time though, that becomes, I don't want to say obnoxious. That's
00:41:27 where the stigma comes from though. Right. You're, you're, you're, you're, you're being
00:41:31 more comfortable in of yourself and you're probably winning allies, but you're also
00:41:35 creating enemies you wouldn't otherwise have at the same time. That's true. There's a difference.
00:41:39 There's a, there's a big social problem with confusing tolerance, with like acceptance,
00:41:45 like, like people tolerate things even though they don't like them. And that's what we should aim
00:41:49 for. Like right now, everyone, you don't have the right to be loved by everybody. Well, that's
00:41:54 for sure. That's for sure. And there's a huge difference between fighting for tolerance and
00:41:58 fighting for being loved. And I feel like a lot of people have that problem. Right. Right now,
00:42:03 I still get shit occasionally. This is pretty rare for me, but it's like people will
00:42:07 at me and like give me shit about the fact that I even liked my little pony at all,
00:42:12 despite like never being in any way like a creep or like weird about it. I simply like a show.
00:42:19 And because it's associated with like things happening with other people elsewhere,
00:42:25 you know, even maybe touching into the furry community to some degree, obviously, like then
00:42:29 that there's just, there's a social miasma that just swirls around these things. And I mean,
00:42:34 it's around every community. You know, there's, there's bad things about every single community,
00:42:37 which is why I'm so anti-identitarian and think everyone should just be their individual self
00:42:42 and be judged on their own merits. Yeah. This will be a thing later. Word. To all viewers,
00:42:49 you may like think, ah, these fucking guys, what the fuck are they talking about? They just don't
00:42:55 want people to be nice to one another on their own fucking discord service. What's in her new
00:43:00 guys? Well, that's the thing. You fucking dumb ass slut. You fucking drink up, come you fucking
00:43:06 bitch. Is because I have opinions and I have been forced to think about my opinion on this subject.
00:43:14 As you all know, in a little podcast named Armour Fucking Trevill, I discussed extensively how much
00:43:21 I dislike the characters for exhibiting overly sexual and creepy, disgusting, perverted dialogue
00:43:27 constantly without any respite and how I dislike the overall, you know, jovial and cheerful and,
00:43:33 you know, hug, boxy nature of the characters in that. So don't you come fucking tell me that this
00:43:38 is some like, you know, oh, I'm just hanging furries for no fucking reason. Oh, my son's a fucking
00:43:43 foreigner. He's taking ten cocks up the ass. You know what the fuck you're talking about. Well,
00:43:47 you know what, maybe I don't, but am I not allowed to feel things? Am I not allowed to have a soul?
00:43:52 Am I not allowed to have my heart singing? All right. Well, what else you got, Munchy? What's
00:43:57 point two here? Or may I say something? Well, I actually wanted to sort of shift the topic about
00:44:03 your opinion about life personas and stuff. Yes. Yes. Oh, I would love to get in this, please, please.
00:44:09 Like, oh, like specifically, would you guys like to have personas or just
00:44:13 I'm, please define. Wait, wait. In major, in your own words, please define a fursona.
00:44:19 Well, basically, you that is like an anthropomorphic animal.
00:44:24 We literally all have those because we were all, we all have brony so.
00:44:29 Yes. I kind of, I kind of like put the brony part away from the furries. I have no interest in doing
00:44:38 that specifically with like an anthro animal man, man boy, or, I mean, it's just like, what, what,
00:44:45 what is the end game of having a fursona? If you just really like. And you want to be a person,
00:44:52 it's just natural. It's just, I think it's just a way of participating in the community. Like,
00:44:56 the same reason we all had horse characters. Yeah, that's true. It's the exact same.
00:45:01 Science, do you remember? I did like some sketches like a way, way back ago before,
00:45:07 before Munchie was even born. Oh my God.
00:45:14 Of like several of us members as like animal characters. Like, I think.
00:45:20 Yeah, that was for an RPG that we were going to do. Yeah. Yeah. I was a spider lady and.
00:45:26 Yeah, that was great. I remember those. Well, okay, but you're calling it a fursona. To me,
00:45:33 it's almost like just like fan art of a sort, you know, in a certain way. I think a huge part
00:45:39 of the existence of fursonas has to do with the fact that like fur affinity and like artwork is
00:45:45 such a big part of the furry community. And so people just kind of have a character so that
00:45:50 there is a vessel to have art. Like, like YMS, for instance, will regularly buy commissions of
00:45:57 just his like other artists he likes drawing his horse character. And since, you know,
00:46:03 commissions, they can charge whatever they want if it's a good enough artist. So like these people
00:46:09 are willing to pay to have their fursonas. So like it's just kind of a part of the culture is like
00:46:15 this this weird dropping all your money on like bronies were like this, too. This is also part of
00:46:21 for other levels are like they just spend lots and lots of money. And I do think there's an
00:46:27 element of like, uh, I think a lot of like, well, furries have disposable income is what I'm
00:46:34 saying. Sure. I want to stress that I have literally seen a person on Tumblr that like is
00:46:42 poor and could barely pay rent by $80 commissions. Like like he spent literally, literally like all
00:46:51 of his money, all of his written money. I'm not fucking joking. Like seriously. What would you
00:46:57 say? What would you say to someone who came back with this, like someone who's maybe like a member
00:47:01 of the trans community and would say that like, but Munchy, don't you see he needs to invest at
00:47:06 least some maybe that's too much money. But like he feels like like he doesn't belong in his body.
00:47:11 And he feels like he needs to be depicted as this persona in order to feel okay about himself.
00:47:16 I don't think that's not the point of them. But I would say no, that's not all the point.
00:47:21 Maybe that's the other thing. I think that what Munchy is describing with this guy,
00:47:26 this is something I've seen a lot of, which is just some people get locked into pleasure spending
00:47:34 and literally just spend all their goddamn money. And it's a big thing in these communities. Like
00:47:38 my, uh, my ex-girlfriend was not really a furry, but she was big into like buying plushies on Deviant
00:47:45 Art and like literally would just like spend all her fucking money on that and then ran out of money
00:47:51 and like had no money anymore because she would drop like $500 on a plushie, like a custom made
00:47:56 Etsy plushie like every fucking week. And eventually you don't have money anymore. So that's what
00:48:02 happens. It's advice like anything else. Yeah, go on Munchy, go on. Did you side topic real quick?
00:48:09 I was really listening to the horse cast for various reasons. And in the first episode,
00:48:13 like 20 minutes in, you're just like, hey, can I just like bring my ex-girlfriend into the call?
00:48:18 And she's like, uh, okay. And then she's just there for the rest of the episode. Is that true?
00:48:24 Just like in the background, just sometimes chiming in. Damn, I never noticed that. I must have not
00:48:29 listened to that one. Very funny. Very fucking funny. Well, I think I made my point. So, I mean,
00:48:37 well, what I was going to say was like, you could, I, that is a good point, did you? I totally
00:48:42 think that's a reasonable thing to say. It's just like, I don't know what I said. That was like a
00:48:46 pet, like none of what you just said would reconcile with the thing that I had said. Like, no, no,
00:48:53 well, I mean, no, that's what I'm saying. It's like, what I'm saying is like the most defensive
00:48:58 position that like someone who's like trying to like explain this behavior is like a necessary
00:49:03 thing somebody needs to engage in. No, no, I'm not trying to say that at all. I'm just saying that
00:49:06 some dumb motherfuckers just like to blow through all the goddamn money. That's what I'm saying too.
00:49:11 It's not defensible at all. This guy's a fucking idiot. He just doesn't know how to spend money.
00:49:16 You're right. I'm just recognizing that as a fair counterpoint to what I was saying. And like,
00:49:20 it's really hard for me to like know what that's like. Like, once in a while, I absolutely do
00:49:26 just waste some money on like a new video game that I really don't need that I want. But like,
00:49:30 to this degree is unfathomable to me. I can't imagine doing that. I don't know, man. I guess
00:49:36 these are just, I think these are just irresponsible people if you, if you do something, you know,
00:49:39 to that degree. You know, I mean, if I, if you, if you're not an artist, I can understand what
00:49:46 wanting to spend tons of money getting like art of your character made. I feel blessed. I feel
00:49:52 blessed to have the skills that I can just do it myself and turn my nose up.
00:49:55 Yeah, but that's your goddamn privilege. It is my privilege. And I'm fucking, I'm never checking
00:49:59 it. But you learned how to draw, Ben. I don't accept that as a privilege. No, I was born with
00:50:05 this ability. I never worked a day in my life. But there's like different art styles out there
00:50:12 and something you can do and maybe you want to see in a different style. That's true. That's fair.
00:50:18 Yeah, I'm not saying I do understand, I do understand the drive to like commission art.
00:50:23 Like it makes sense. I hardly ever do it. I sort of, I sort of share it. I guess it's a bit of an
00:50:29 ego of an artist. Why pay for it if I can do it myself at the same time? I want to, I want to
00:50:34 support my fellow artists and also I like other art styles. So I have commissioned other artists
00:50:40 to draw my characters a few times. It's really fun. It's really neat. It's just, it's kind of,
00:50:45 I guess it's kind of paying, like paying for fan art. So it's kind of sad, but at the same time,
00:50:52 to see the art in the end. I want to discuss OC's and not just, you know, original characters,
00:50:59 like Ben, you wouldn't consider like a magda in OC, right? This is, I'm very interested in this
00:51:05 discussion of what is an OC. And yeah, yeah, I think technically anything you make up yourself
00:51:11 is an OC. But I think that, but I think that if you talk like that, it doesn't make any sense.
00:51:17 I think you might, at that point, you might as well just call them your, you know,
00:51:20 I have a definition. I have a definition. Okay. For this discussion, I want, when I say OC's,
00:51:27 it'll be short for NC's, which is narrative-less characters. These are characters you can create
00:51:33 just for the purpose of having a character. See, see, that's a little different to me.
00:51:39 I mean, avatars is a word I would use as well. To me.
00:51:42 Because you can have multiple avatars, you know, and these are just the ones you cycle between,
00:51:46 if you even used them that way. But like, yeah, it's, it's really fascinating the way that people
00:51:51 will like project themselves onto an illustration they didn't even make up. And then like, be like,
00:51:59 this is who I am now, and I spend all my money on this character now, like. To me. Yeah, it's
00:52:04 interesting. An OC, like I always felt like the best definition for an OC is a, it's a,
00:52:10 it's a character, but it's a character that exists within like another canon that you don't know.
00:52:15 Correct. Like an OC is a character you make up that is in like My Little Pony or Danganronpa or
00:52:21 whatever. That's an MC most of the time, fan character. But like, I mean, the terms aren't
00:52:26 interchangeable. It doesn't really matter so much, but like specifically that would be a fan character,
00:52:31 like in a fandom. Fair enough. What about a character that exists outside of any fandom?
00:52:36 That's just like, those exist. And those are what I would call NC's narrative.
00:52:39 That's what I would call OC's because I always create a narrative for my characters,
00:52:44 even if they don't have a fandom. Well, I mean, okay, okay, if you create a narrative for them,
00:52:49 and like you create like a comic or something for them, then like no one can, like, like,
00:52:52 I know I understand super pretentious here, but I totally do. And I can't deny that I put like,
00:52:57 characters in a story above characters without a story. I think we can all understand why,
00:53:01 because you need narratives to get like greater insight into the characters and gives them a
00:53:07 purpose for existing and allows, you know, themes, narrative plots to come out of them and make me
00:53:15 care about them. I do not care about narratives. But aesthetic is a narrative. That's true.
00:53:23 Okay, hold on. Wait, this is important.
00:53:27 Thanks for interrupting me like three times. Sorry.
00:53:32 To make a character, I think it's important to know why you're creating the character,
00:53:35 what purpose, and for what sort of universe or whatever, even though like a lot of my
00:53:39 characters lack description and deviant, and I'd be like, Hey, I made this boy, isn't he cute?
00:53:45 And you know, I don't put any information, know that I still think about the information when
00:53:51 I'm drawing like, what's the purpose of this thing? So the audience, though, how do they know
00:53:55 any of this? It should be conveyed in the design, I would think, you know, the design has to be
00:54:01 informed by your ideas, because it has to have some sort of consistency with whatever you're doing.
00:54:06 I mean, by that definition, then every character ever drawn, like there has to be some thought
00:54:10 into why they are what they are. So, you know, is it really true? Because you could have the
00:54:15 decision of like, this guy's wearing this chain, because it will look cool on this outfit. Or
00:54:20 you can think like, this guy picked up this chain from his dead grandma, and like, it has a
00:54:26 fucking secret resonance. And also, it's like how he uses his soul play. You know what it is?
00:54:31 If your character exists in any narrative, then they have to like have like a history and a
00:54:35 story. It's like, it's like, when you try to observe an electron, that's when it like chooses
00:54:39 a placement. It's when you try to observe a character in any narrative, like their history
00:54:43 develops instantly. But until you do so, it does not exist. Shrodingers. You know what I mean?
00:54:50 I think that a character doesn't need, okay, I mean, I think that you can like plan out your
00:54:55 characters like history and backstory and personality and relationships and all that stuff.
00:54:59 I wouldn't say that you shouldn't do that. But I think that you totally can create a character
00:55:03 with like very little history or like prethought and like put them in a story and have a character
00:55:10 kind of emerge out of that. Totally. Totally. That's not what I'm arguing. I'm kind of arguing
00:55:17 against mage that like that kind of like pre narrative like character creation is like it's
00:55:24 not always necessary. Alright, enough of whatever the hell we were just talking about. Munchy,
00:55:30 get to the business. The point, the point here that I dislike OCs for is because I feel they are like
00:55:37 basically inherently shallow without other characters or a narrative or plot to speak of. I
00:55:43 feel that they are shallow and cannot reach like the same level as like, you know, a fucking
00:55:48 anime comedy. Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're talking about a furry in real life? No, I'm talking
00:55:54 about an OC. I'm talking about an OC. Oh, yeah, okay, okay, okay. So this ties into real life
00:56:00 because most of the first suits are the OCs that people have created. So I am willing to binge
00:56:07 a little bit and allow people to say, you know, it's a performance art, you know, these people
00:56:10 are performing a character when they put on the costume. But if it's a shit character then. Yeah,
00:56:15 but it's a shit character is my point. It's a shit character that is shallow.
00:56:18 And okay, there's a difference between a sona and a character, but yeah.
00:56:22 No, no, I'm aware that there is, but a lot of there are first suits that are not for sonas.
00:56:28 It's not, it's not, it's not. Is it, is it a faux pas to go up to someone and say,
00:56:33 you're boring and I find your real life narrative shit? Because like, is it a faux pas to come up
00:56:39 to someone? I have done that and it was a faux pas. It was definitely who would have guessed.
00:56:48 Because that's basically what Munchie is advocating here with the furry community.
00:56:51 Your narrative is garbage. You need to revisit why am I advocating going up to people and like
00:56:57 shoving them down to the ground and like, well, why am I doing that? Because you're a white nationalist.
00:57:03 When I was in high school, I told a girl she was cliche and she did not take that very well.
00:57:09 Damn girl. That's pretty, that's pretty like, that's called a girl that's like, that's like,
00:57:13 that's like that part in American beauty where the guy tells the girl that she's boring and ordinary.
00:57:18 Oh yeah. My favorite part because I'm like all women. Am I right, man?
00:57:24 Smash. Smash the matriarch.
00:57:27 What else is worth though? She was like the only female juggalo I've ever met, so she wasn't that
00:57:32 Whoa!
00:57:38 Wildly recontextualized the story. The only female juggalo I've ever met was Jackie.
00:57:43 So like, yeah, I mean, you know, she's always down to clown.
00:57:51 I want to shift to point two of why I hate furries and by why I hate furries,
00:57:58 you all fucking know, I'm not going to put on the fucking killings a little more.
00:58:00 It's a fucking joke. I'm supposed to be hyperbolic in order to maintain comedy.
00:58:03 I don't actually, you know, it's, it's not, I don't actually have that much ill will.
00:58:06 Why hate furries? Two fursuits. I hate fucking fursuits and here's the thing.
00:58:14 They're ugly, man. They're ugly.
00:58:16 Here's what all furries, all furries have jumped up their ears. They're the little cute tail ears
00:58:21 have perked up and they're buying a mean comment right now. You guys have only seen fucking mass,
00:58:27 you know, mascot costumes. You haven't seen the real Rasha. You're just taking the worst of the
00:58:33 bunch and, you know, making fun of them. Not all fursuits are the same, my friend. Sick.
00:58:38 But here's what I have to say to you. The best and the worst fursuits, I hate them for the same
00:58:44 reasons. That's what I say when I say that I don't like anime style or like furry style.
00:58:48 It's not that they are literally the same. I just hate them all for similar reasons.
00:58:53 That's why I say that I don't like the furries styles because there are things about, you know,
00:58:58 commonly, you know, generic furries styles that are all like similar among different artists.
00:59:04 Yeah. And this is the same for fursuits, obviously. There are good fursuits and there are bad fursuits,
00:59:10 but they're indistinguishable to me because they both have the same trapeze. I've seen autumn
00:59:15 fallings, yeah, fucking names dropped, I'm a partition. Yeah. Get on my fucking level.
00:59:19 They're still bad. I got to back that up. You know, sometimes the artwork is well-crafted,
00:59:25 but like aesthetically, furry art is fucking repulsive. And I'm not even going to knock them
00:59:31 for that because obviously a lot of the shit that I like would repulse a lot of people. Like,
00:59:38 the porn I look at, if you showed it to your mom, she'd just fucking die instantly. Like,
00:59:44 knowing that, literally knowing that someone jacks off to this would kill a lot of moms.
00:59:50 The thing about the furry aesthetic that gets me, more than, I mean, I don't like it,
00:59:55 but more than just that I don't like it is that it's incredibly samey and it's all very like
01:00:01 self-reflective, you know, like it all looks like itself. Yeah, it's very incestuous. It's literally
01:00:08 tons and tons of the same. It's all so insular. It's a bunch of young artists copying old
01:00:15 artists that all copied fucking Don Bluth. Right, you know, or that it's that kind of scenario.
01:00:21 The thing that makes, I think, furry stuff like not as good as like anime is that like,
01:00:26 anime, like there's an anime style that like anyone sees like that's an anime,
01:00:30 but there are things like just for example, one piece that does not look like a normal
01:00:35 anime. There's for just like that. I was just going to say that I've never seen any furry art
01:00:40 that like actually looks like that. Oh, no, no, no. There's tons of... I say that, but then I found
01:00:45 this online, but then I found this image and I knew that I had found true love on this day.
01:00:53 Where is this? It's in the main chat. It'll be in the show notes, everybody. You're going to want to
01:00:57 see this shit. There's this one that's undeniably beautiful here. I have to find this. You guys
01:01:03 keep talking and I'll be listening. We're getting derailed.
01:01:06 Tom, what do you have to say about all this? You're a known degenerate. What do you think about
01:01:10 all this? Definitely. I don't know. I don't really find fur suits all that aesthetically pleasing.
01:01:19 I think my biggest problem with fur suits, and there are some that dodge this problem,
01:01:24 like the ones that are done like immaculately well, they all feel very lifeless. Like the whole
01:01:28 idea is you're trying to portray this cartoon character, but there's just very little emotion
01:01:34 in the face or anything and it feels very dead. It feels like you're wearing some cartoon husk.
01:01:42 Let me tell you a little story that's somewhat relevant to this. I went to Chuck E. Cheese not
01:01:46 that long ago for Jackie's birthday and Chuck E. was there. The man himself. Damn. He was quite
01:01:54 short. He was quite short. He only came up to my nose. I went to give him a high five and he's
01:02:02 looking down with his big stupid mouse grin and he's waving at the kids that are all jumping around
01:02:07 and grabbing tickets out of his hands. I went to give him a high five and he totally whiffed me.
01:02:14 You know why? I realized later, it's because he could not see me because he could only see down
01:02:19 out of his mouth. Well, here's here. Well, I guess that makes sense. This is supposed to be children.
01:02:24 Yeah. He can only see the kids below him, but here you see the world of adults that lives above.
01:02:29 This is kind of going off track, but I can kind of pull it back into something relevant.
01:02:33 That's terrifying. Is that look at this one, everybody. It's a Pikachu fursuit. All right,
01:02:38 I get it. The show notes. Check this out. Yeah. That's a good one. Damn. Dude, she's thick. Dude,
01:02:44 this girl. Have you seen the Celestias? No. I don't know. But Ben, Ben, I'm surprised they
01:02:51 still even have fursuits at Chuck E. Cheese because the current Chuck E. Cheese mascot,
01:02:55 he's the size of a regular mouse. Yeah. And here's the question. Is the current Chuck E. Cheese
01:03:00 mascot a furry anymore? He's just an anthropomorphized character and not a furry because he's definitely
01:03:06 a delineation. He's riding the line. He's getting more and more mousy, but I think he's still on the
01:03:11 side of evil. But the current character is the size of a mouse. He's like this tiny little
01:03:16 mouse running around wearing a shirt. Well, not when he's in a fursuit. He's not. I get it. That's
01:03:21 weird to me. I found the fur yard. That is weird. That he's an actual mouse or something. I found
01:03:26 the fur yard. That is good. And I'm about to post it. This is by Glitched Puppet of the comic
01:03:31 Floraverse. This is like the one piece. This is like the one piece. Floraverse is that one that's
01:03:37 nice. Floraverse is that one that's pretty cool, but it's got the like secret porn side. Yes, yes.
01:03:42 It's got the secret porn page. I remember I mirror Way Back when you discussed that. And then I was
01:03:48 like, huh, how interesting. Floraverse is actually pretty cool in a lot of ways. I found out about
01:03:54 it myself. And I was like, oh, this is the thing that Ben talked about. And I had the same conclusion
01:03:58 that you did. Yeah, it's like, it's cool. I mean, but it's also a little like, eh, it's a little
01:04:04 squeaky. This looks great. I mean, this looks really nice. I wouldn't even consider this
01:04:09 furry art. This is the one that you said that the artist also does like porn, right? They have two
01:04:14 patreons, one for the like the main comic and one for like the porn side stories. If this artist draws
01:04:19 porn, I need to get on that immediately. They do. I'll leave it to you right now, my friends. Now,
01:04:26 I don't think this is the case, but is this like there is one, it's not really furry, but there
01:04:31 is a, uh, a comic that features a unicorn that all of 4chan regards is extremely sexy. Like she's
01:04:37 like, oh, I know exactly the one you're thinking of. This is not that. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay,
01:04:41 I guess not. I don't know what you're talking about. It's, it's the, I want to blank that blank.
01:04:46 And it's, you know, it's that old meme. Indeed. Well, uh, okay, dope, dope. I mean, we've done it
01:04:52 guys. I guess, I guess furries are somewhat saved. We've redeemed them. You're always trying to
01:04:58 in podcast, you're always trying to close. That's your main occupation is podcast. No, no, no,
01:05:04 much. You don't understand. I'm going for the fake out ending. I want everyone to think that we
01:05:07 resolve so that you can blast their assholes wide open with the truth at the end of the, it's like
01:05:12 the post, uh, credits, uh, final sequence. So let's, what else you got for us? Well, okay, let's,
01:05:18 let's get meta here real quick because this, I'm about to launch into a thing and this was,
01:05:24 and this was made, I have not scripted this like I usually do with notes, but this is on top of
01:05:28 my head. But this was intended, this idea was intended to come after a long section of me talk
01:05:34 about how I dislike, you know, the, the, the niceness and stuff, but that came at the beginning.
01:05:38 That's all fine. So just know that, uh, the impassioned rant I'm about to go on is totally
01:05:43 unearned within the context of the podcast. Only makes sense in my own mind, but just make sure
01:05:46 that this is just, no, for a fact, this is all genuine and not fake. And this is all is true.
01:05:52 The reason why I dislike that all this fucking gross ass, gross,
01:05:57 melty, hug box bullshit is because I was fucking there. Digi knows on fucking Tumblr,
01:06:04 I was in the most perverse and disgusting parts of the Brony fandom. And I was surrounded by
01:06:09 hug box, gross fucking openly sexual people all the time. And it fucked me up and made me sad
01:06:14 all the time being around all these people who are so freely open about, about their sexual
01:06:20 impulses and about, about all their, you know, trying to be all touchy and feely and all gross
01:06:26 all around me. It made me a disgusting person because like, because I couldn't hold back on
01:06:29 like, unlike my, you know, my urges and I turned into a weird fucking gross ass.
01:06:33 Oh no. And it was completely awful experience for everyone involved. And so, and so I grew up
01:06:39 and I, and I knew that I couldn't be like this anymore. Due to this group right fucking here
01:06:43 at BronyCon, I was a fucking bitch. But then I hung out with all view fucking people and I turned
01:06:48 to not a bitch. Simplified. But that's fine. That's fine. So the first time we met, you were,
01:06:53 you were deep in the shit, huh? Yeah, I was deep in the shit. Damn. And, and, and, and due to hanging
01:06:59 out with you guys and, and, you know, other friends, I slowly regained my humanity and renounced,
01:07:04 and renounced being a fucking carpet munchery, fucking, you know, like foreign, foreign browser,
01:07:09 you know, is this the, is this the off discussed like role play lifestyle that you mentioned?
01:07:14 My role plays came, my role plays were super innocent and just like I was like a kid on the
01:07:20 internet doing Pokemon. Sure. It was like home stuck. You were like Nepeta. I gotta pounce.
01:07:27 I gotta go on a thing here because I'm looking at this forbidden flora.com that munchy.
01:07:34 Man, the furry porn. So annoying. I think I've realized that the only thing that makes me not
01:07:42 a furry is that furry is defined by like the certain aesthetic and like
01:07:49 characteristics, you know, because if it was anime porn, you could draw any, like, you could
01:07:55 draw me a furry fuck and I will look at it and like it. Monster girls, man. Of course. I love,
01:08:01 love monster girls or any, just any type of like animal, human, hybrid, like the game Juan
01:08:06 Koto Kurasa, which is just about fucking like girls who are literally dogs, but they're like,
01:08:12 they look like human girls. Like, I mean, and even like, I look at tons of poke porn, but like,
01:08:18 and I was looking at this forbidden flora and I'm like, this would be my thing. Like, I think
01:08:23 this artist is really good. I think they have, they draw good porn. The only problem is that there
01:08:29 are little subtle things that make it extremely furry feeling. And those are the only things
01:08:34 that turn me off about it. Like, otherwise it'd be perfectly fine, but I just look at it and I'm
01:08:38 like, Oh, if they didn't look like fucking furries, this would be really hot. Well, see, that's,
01:08:43 that's what I, that's what I think about. That's why I'm so strident in my defense of like all
01:08:47 these people. Cause like, I have jacked off to every kind of porn there is, and I will do so
01:08:52 again in the future. Furry, scat, well, not really a girl or anything. Well, not, not even that much
01:08:56 scat. The scat kind of turns me off, but it doesn't matter. The point is, like, I don't want to
01:09:00 limit my freedoms. I mean, I was watching, I was watching, not resort, Bowen, uh,
01:09:04 like Aerogay, it's this whatever thing. And then like, all of a sudden there's just a shitting
01:09:08 scene and I was like, what the fuck is happening right now? Uh, it does matter. It happens all
01:09:12 the time in porn, especially like pissing is near constant in anime porn. If you watch enough
01:09:19 anime porn, if you watch enough anime porn and you're not into pissing, it can be difficult
01:09:25 because it's just going to happen. Like, I know we've all seen Oni Chichi and I know there's
01:09:30 pissing at least once in that scene. I don't even know what that is. What are you talking about?
01:09:35 I guess, I guess I'm not as degenerate as you all thought I was. No, Oni Chichi is like the most
01:09:39 popular hentai, like, ever, other than Bible Black. It's like the one that everyone's seen.
01:09:43 Is it about Chichi from Dragon Ball? No, it's just about some blonde girl getting
01:09:48 fucked by like her stepdad, I think, but like, they made like 80 episodes of it.
01:09:53 Hit up my boys on hentai gasm to see that shit. That's the real shit. Yo, all right,
01:09:58 we earlier discussed about TMI. Hentai Gasm is a good site. I'd like it.
01:10:05 But all I want to say is I am so absolutist in my viewing of like, all this is fine.
01:10:11 Like, I don't want to shame anybody. Do exactly what you want to do. It's totally cool.
01:10:16 But like, I think keep it in the privacy of your own home. Like, I do degenerate shit and I talk
01:10:23 about it here because it's funny. But like, if I was just hanging out with my friends and I started
01:10:26 talking about my weird fetishes, then like, there's an audience. You got to consider your
01:10:31 audience is all I'm saying. And you will creep people out if you start talking about the shit
01:10:36 openly. Like, thinking about it from their perspective, they are all furries. They all
01:10:40 do this. Why would they not discuss what they that even if I was a huge furry? I like, yes,
01:10:46 there's like the emancipation element, like, we shouldn't be ashamed for this. Like, yeah,
01:10:49 we're going to talk about rah rah. But on the like, it's right the path. I don't want to,
01:10:52 I don't want to hear about heterosexual sex that my buddies are having. I'm not
01:10:56 interested. I mean, I think that's, I think that's kind of unique to you though, Nate,
01:11:00 because I think it's fairly normal for like locker room talk to be like, yeah, I fucked
01:11:04 that bitch last night and put it in her ass. And it's not the same thing. I think it's,
01:11:10 wait, what is different about that? What do you mean it's not the same? Well, I mean,
01:11:13 if it's open the door, it's different to hear about my buddy plowing his girlfriend night
01:11:17 after night after night, as opposed to, yeah, at one night stand with this girl who you'll
01:11:21 never meet. Those are two different situations. I guess, I mean, I also see it as like, I mean,
01:11:28 me and my friends, fair enough, me and my other, you know, my offline friends, we even talk about
01:11:33 porn all the time because we were all just huge porn fans. Like, so, well, you know, I'm into
01:11:38 porn. I mean, all day, whether it's a girlfriend or a one night stand. Yeah, I kind of don't want
01:11:42 to think about my friends having sex ever, you know, that's where I'm coming from. That's where
01:11:48 I'm coming from. But hey, man, if I'm the weird one, fair enough, I accept it. I don't think you're
01:11:52 gross for doing it, but I think that thinking about it is kind of gross, you know, you know.
01:11:56 Class, man. Yeah, I know that we disagree on this topic, me and Digian, probably other people here,
01:12:01 but that's that's what comes down to for me. I think about everybody having sex.
01:12:06 Thanks. Well, okay. Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to say to watch any, you know, potential uprising
01:12:17 here, people are probably going to be like, munchy, like, like, like, I'm like, you Nick,
01:12:21 where I think you can do whatever you want sexually and you can do whatever you want.
01:12:24 Like, basically, you know, I'm pretty into, you know, freedom and, you know, do whatever you want.
01:12:29 It's your life. But like, I'm, you know, I'm an alt person. I'm living the alternative lifestyle.
01:12:35 I am not, I am not, you know, following society's normals. Why should I impose society's rules?
01:12:40 Like, why should I pick and choose the ones that I choose to follow? Like, you know, not protect
01:12:44 the freedoms, protect the freedoms of people who disagree with you people because one day
01:12:48 they're coming for your shit. Exactly. So I'm, none of this is meaning to intend like,
01:12:53 furries, stop it. I don't like furries. In fact, I wish that they didn't exist, but they do. And so
01:13:01 I'm not going to make any attempt to make sure that they stop being real. Right. And that's the
01:13:06 difference between my opinion and that's the difference between tolerance and like loving
01:13:10 that I was talking about earlier. Yes. Correct. And now there's an elephant in the room for this
01:13:14 whole conversation, Munchie, that I've deliberately avoided mentioning until now.
01:13:20 How big is the dick on that elephant? Cause I am, I'm getting horny thinking about all this.
01:13:27 Is it, is it, is it appropriate to bring it up now, Munchie? Or are you, do you want to,
01:13:30 you know, wait? I haven't asked the other party if they, I don't think they would fucking care,
01:13:35 yeah, whatever. Well, okay. Here's the deal, people. Munchie is dating a furry right now.
01:13:39 He is dating a big ol' fursuit furry. Yeah. So that's the context of this whole conversation.
01:13:43 It's not even a moderate, itch. She, she can't, Cassey, link, link in the description.
01:13:50 It's not even like a moderate furry. Like she's, she's real.
01:13:54 But see, but see, that's the thing, man. Tolerance, right? Like you, you're not into it, right?
01:13:58 I should also mention that she is not, she, she does not exhibit the behaviors that I have described
01:14:06 here. Well, yeah, there you go. She does not role play or anything. Proving that there are good
01:14:11 furries, you know, basically. Yeah. She does not exhibit the overwhelming, you know, heat,
01:14:19 and unbelievable, you know, warmness of, of unearned kinship. She does not exhibit that.
01:14:25 Yes. Yes. She's one of the good ones. Thumbs up. There you go.
01:14:30 Um, but yeah, uh, furries are all great. They give charities. How many charities have you
01:14:35 donated to, motherfuckers? Furries are all about charities. Do you, do you consider furry
01:14:39 patreons a charity? If so, they are the most generous organization in the entire universe.
01:14:44 That is also, that is also a good thing about furries, is that like, like, even though we can
01:14:48 make fun of them for spending so much money on commissions, and we should, because that's not
01:14:51 smart, uh, they do like support artists mad hardcore. Well, I think the reason that furries
01:14:57 support artists so much is because, like, because their fandom has no, like, canon material,
01:15:02 you can't just go buy the official release of Furry. It's just, it's all community driven
01:15:08 material. So if you want to, like, spend something, you can't just go out buy the
01:15:11 Blu-ray of Furry season one. You've got to support artists because that's all there is.
01:15:15 You know, I bet, I bet that is a ton to do with why they're so vocal and like fervorous in their
01:15:19 little community because it's so like shunned by, I mean, that's probably true of everybody who's
01:15:23 got a community like that, you know? Oh, I've, I've definitely, this is definitely true. Like,
01:15:27 the more that you voice opinions against furries, the more they will come away brazen in their
01:15:32 attitude. I honestly think, I think that on some level, I don't know how deliberate this is, but
01:15:37 I definitely think that it's understood by a lot of the furries that a lot of the outlandishness of
01:15:44 it, I think, is deliberate to keep people away. Because like, no one, yeah, no one fucks with
01:15:52 furries because everyone thinks they're disgusting and crazy. Like, furries, like-
01:15:56 You got your, like, Mr. Medicurys and those kind of guys who, like, deliberately try to, like,
01:16:00 you know, go out and start shit with these people. Yeah, but like, for the most part, I feel like
01:16:05 furries, like, the sign on the door is like, this is, this is how fucked it's gonna be in here,
01:16:11 so is that something you relate to? If so, come along and like, if you make it past that barrier,
01:16:17 it's like you're already, I think that's why there's such a hug box is that, like,
01:16:20 you've made it past this incredible barrier of, like, sacrificing your own conception of
01:16:26 your social normalcy. You're not wrong. You're not wrong. I mean, you're basically saying, like,
01:16:32 I am committing to never being a normie again. Like, something similar happened. I mean, at least
01:16:38 while you identify, it's not a complete transformation. That is true. Yeah, I mean, and you can, you
01:16:44 can stop being a furry one day, if you so desire. I'm just possibly burn and bury all footage of
01:16:52 you having been a furry. There's probably plenty of pictures out there, because these are cons are
01:16:56 all well documented. Yeah, social media. But like, I just think that there's, there's an element of
01:17:02 the fact that you even are willing to call yourself a furry is enough to give you some
01:17:07 camaraderie that, like, you are willing to, you know, stand in this world that, that where furries
01:17:13 are literally the bottom rung of society, they're everyone's punching bag. And yet, like, if you're
01:17:18 willing to call yourself that, then it's like, all right, you've made it into the herd, you know.
01:17:23 I think furry is, I would, I would give furries the, the immaculate distinction of being
01:17:28 the lowest level, like the lowest rung of society, that it doesn't quite make sense to, like,
01:17:34 deliberately mock or shame. Like, and like, when you get to, like, other can right below them,
01:17:38 at that point, it's like, well, okay, now that's open season, like, these people are insane.
01:17:42 But, you know, unless they're, I guess, they're playing around, whatever. By the way, by the way,
01:17:46 I just, I namedrop Mr. Medeker before, he actually is more charitable towards furries,
01:17:51 and he's just harder on, like, other can. So I just want to, like, I don't like hate the guy,
01:17:54 he's not like insane or anything, just, just saying. People might be like, why do we feel
01:17:58 the need to come on this? We are not furry experts. We, we, we, people like this are all the time
01:18:03 where they're like, oh, you don't know everything there is to know about physics. How dare you have
01:18:08 a nihilism episode? What the fuck are you doing, you dumb bitches? But, but, like, are, like,
01:18:14 are we not allowed to comment on things as we see them? Because it's not, it's not like we are
01:18:19 forming them out, out of the ether, purely from, like, going into fortune and hearing
01:18:23 secondhand information. We've all seen furries. I mean, it's also not, it's not as though at the end
01:18:29 of a PCP episode, whatever conclusion we've come to about, like, how we should all think about
01:18:36 this. We press a button and now, like, it is so, you know, like, oh, I've, we've, oh, we've concluded
01:18:41 furries are bad. I press this button and now that's what the world is from this point forward.
01:18:45 It's like, there's no consequence to this show. Well, this is, this is a comedy show, everybody.
01:18:51 It's just the conversation. And like, that's, I guess that's the interesting part is like,
01:18:55 because for everybody who's like into the furry thing, being like, they're missing so much the
01:18:58 important nuance, like, there's also people who are outside. If you feel that way, please look
01:19:03 at what we're like, this is how even people who are close to furries think of them. So if we're
01:19:08 wrong, this is your PR, motherfucker. Like, you gotta do something about it. I think we've been
01:19:13 pretty magnanimous here, relatively speaking, I think. I mean, I mean, at the end of the day,
01:19:18 I don't have any ill will. This has happened before on other episodes, where I am a fucking
01:19:24 knowledgeable saint. And I will just say what I say if you'll be like, you missed this, you didn't
01:19:29 factor this into your equation. But I did know that fact, and it just wasn't important. Like,
01:19:35 you can say a bunch of shit in the comments about how like furries are like all grain stuff,
01:19:40 or even about how they're all bad. And I will have considered them because I think about this
01:19:44 literally constantly. I know everything that you could possibly say. And this is my opinion.
01:19:50 People like, like the reason I feel the need to comment on this isn't just because I want to be a
01:19:54 funny people with my friends. I don't want to be, I just want to be funny people. No, it's because
01:19:57 I have to think about this. This isn't a joke anymore. This has reached a stage where I could
01:20:03 no longer deny that furries exist and go on with my day just treating them like, ah, they're just
01:20:07 fucking like elves or like trolls. No, furries are real. And I have, I have to, I have to acknowledge
01:20:14 them. It's suffering. I don't like this. I want them to go back to being jokes. I don't like this.
01:20:21 You know, I wonder if like you said at the beginning, and I just remembered my thought,
01:20:25 I thought of the comparison to like the flat earth thing where like that's definitely started as a
01:20:29 joke and a troll, but it just started gaining steam because I don't know, people just like,
01:20:33 we're like, you know what, that's actually not a bad idea. Let's, let's get in on that. And I'm not
01:20:38 trying to shame furries and saying there was craziest flat earthers or anything, but you know,
01:20:42 just, just saying funny comparison. The conclusion I've come away with from this podcast is that I
01:20:47 am a furry. And the only reason I haven't identified it is that I am too much of an
01:20:54 elitist when it comes to the art that I masturbate to. Like if there were furry artists who just drew
01:21:01 anime style, I would be all in on this community because I want to fuck a Pikachu just as badly as
01:21:07 this first suitor does, but she is doing a terrible job of making it look attractive.
01:21:12 Sure. Link did the show notes. We already mentioned I think this.
01:21:17 Indeed. That's the thing. I think like all of us, like, like if some like, you know, guys,
01:21:22 if God gave him dad, it's like, Hey, I'm going to make something to peel us to your taste. It's
01:21:25 just going to be like an anthropomorphic animal. Like it's that cool. So you would probably be
01:21:29 like, yeah, sure. It's not the actual like animal part of it. Like I don't think any of us like
01:21:35 cared that much. The furries, the furries specifically are into that, right? Isn't that what
01:21:38 makes them furry as opposed to like, I've jacked off to tons of furry porn, but for me, it's always
01:21:43 just like, that's a hot girl and oh, she's a dog or whatever. I mean, that's fine. I'll deal with that.
01:21:47 No, what I'm trying to say is that like, it's not like particularly the fact that it is an
01:21:53 anthropomorphic creature. It's just the way that it's always depicted. It's the culture is the
01:21:57 culture of society. Indeed. Indeed. It's the context in which the images exist in.
01:22:04 All right, are we going to move on to questions then? I think it's about time. I think it's about
01:22:08 time. I just want to quickly say, if it wasn't clear enough by this point, because it probably
01:22:15 isn't because it didn't speak much. But you know, overall, I, I like furries in general.
01:22:21 And I like the art, say for work art mostly, I like the character designs a lot. Like what
01:22:27 really interests me about furries is like, they take an animal and they like make a character
01:22:32 design and like the really skilled artists, whenever they like draw like a furry character,
01:22:37 is just like, I don't know why I just, I just really like art. Can my sexuality be art because
01:22:42 I really like art? Well, Mage, here's, here's my question for you. You know, we, uh, we haven't
01:22:46 really addressed this, but, and I think I've asked you personally before, I forget the answer off
01:22:49 hand though, would you consider yourself a furry? You like your anthropomorphic, you know, animal
01:22:54 boys and whatnot? I, I don't know. Like the thing is like, it depends on other people's
01:22:59 definition of furry. I myself am not involved in like any furry communities. Uh, I don't talk to
01:23:06 that many furries. I have no plans in the future to have a fursuit or I'm not even interested
01:23:11 in having a fursuit. I do have a fursona, but that's because I like character designs and
01:23:15 I like making characters and it's just really interesting for me. It's just like, for, for,
01:23:21 people trying to say stuff like, just because you like like MLP or something that like makes
01:23:26 you a brony or something, or just like, I mean, I just hate all the stuff of like, because you
01:23:30 like thing or are generally interested, you like now are considered a member of a community. Anyone
01:23:33 putting a label on you that you don't put on yourself is disgusting. I couldn't agree more,
01:23:38 could not agree more. Yeah. It's, it's like saying everyone who likes a toke is a furry.
01:23:43 So if, if you don't, if, if all those other Ken who refuse to believe that they're human,
01:23:48 guess what? We have no right to call them human. We've lost our, our, it's, it's over. We're done.
01:23:53 He's right. We fucked it up. Yep. We've all learned something today.
01:23:59 All right. Well, I guess that's it. Let's, let's head over to our questions. We're all
01:24:02 furries. We admit it. That was the point. That's who we were building to. We all admit it. We're
01:24:07 active members of the community. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's something
01:24:11 huge. Okay. What animal would you be, Nate? Like, what would your persona be? What animal would
01:24:16 you be? Well, I mean, okay, sure, sure. Uh, everybody always tells me a pig. Sure. That was,
01:24:21 that was the old animal design she did for us and Ben and I were orcs. Um, I mean, everyone says
01:24:26 I'm like a dog. My girlfriend says I'm like a dog. I think I bear a lot of resemblance to a
01:24:30 dog. It works for me, man. I think I'm a dog. I bear a lot of resemblance to a dog like currently.
01:24:36 I resemble a dog. Apparently I look like a German shepherd. I know how much Michelle
01:24:41 like dogs. So that must be, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. It's good for the old romance.
01:24:46 Michelle's a furry for sure, but just for dogs. Oh, it even goes with the best guy ever because,
01:24:51 you know, what's the best compliment to a dog? The best boy. A good boy. He's a good boy. Yeah.
01:24:56 Works for me. I think I could be a dog. I think you can make a strong argument for a dog. I think
01:25:00 it could also be a raccoon or an owl. I would definitely ban a raccoon is fucking perfect.
01:25:07 I was going to go with sloth. I was going to go with sloth. Especially because a raccoon has got
01:25:11 like kind of an edgy like design and everything. No, you're all missing the most obvious point.
01:25:17 Raccoons dig through everyone's trash. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's perfect. It's perfect.
01:25:22 Pensacoon for sure. It's got it. I mean, you know, raccoons are actually nasty. Like they're
01:25:26 actually idiots. Yeah, exactly. Deeply unpleasant creatures. I know you're saying all the right
01:25:32 things. All right. Have you seen their hands? Have you seen a raccoon's hands? Oh, yes, grimy.
01:25:37 They are. They are. They have nasty little like gremlin skeleton hands. Just take a raccoon and
01:25:42 have a vape pen in one hand and a, you know, a tablet pen in the other and you got yourself
01:25:46 a Ben St right there. All right. I would be a Hopkinsville goblin. That's what my
01:25:55 What the hell is that? Here. That's some other kinship. That is some other kinship.
01:26:00 It's this way right here. If I, oh god, why are Google image like links so unbelievably big?
01:26:07 Why is that the case? You just got to go to the actual like image.
01:26:15 But that's technically not an animal. It's like, no, it's an animal. It's an animal.
01:26:20 This is other kin. This is other kin, Munchie. Crippid. Crippid or whatever. Bigfoot is real.
01:26:26 So the Hopkinsville goblin. This is just like the time I told the furries that I was a that I was a
01:26:30 mind flare. I didn't know that fucking Dungeons and Dragons invented that. Well, wait a kink
01:26:36 shame, Ben. I would definitely be like a normal type Pokemon. I would be like some sort of like
01:26:41 bear or like something big and fat and doesn't give a shit. Or like, you know, you know that big
01:26:47 like fairy normal type bear that was a tank and like sun and moon. Beware. Beware is pretty good.
01:26:52 And he's a very Munchie. The way that that Pokemon is portrayed in the TV show is like a Munchie-esque
01:26:58 character. That's true. A power. Because all he does is show up and beat up people and carry them
01:27:03 around basically. All right, Digi, what would you be? Oh, I would be a walrus, probably.
01:27:10 A walrus. I'd like to be depicted as a walrus. Yeah, okay. Well, I already have a fursona,
01:27:16 but I just before I made her like she's a gerboa. That's like a like a little
01:27:21 right mouse thingie. That's a Raichu is right? Wait, is he? Oh, yeah, I think Raichu is one of
01:27:28 those based on it. No, don't you boas. You know, Mew is actually more gerboa-esque than a cat-esque.
01:27:37 Oh, yeah, that's true. With his weird old legs. Yeah, okay. Even the tail. And he'll like, yeah,
01:27:44 gerboa, hopping mouse, whatever. It's cute little hoppy legs. I love it. But before I made her,
01:27:50 I was heavily debating between like a unicorn or a deer or a bunny because I like this
01:27:59 something cute ones. And but like none of them like had all the things I needed because I wanted
01:28:06 a long tail and that I also wanted to like be sort of fluffy and cute and long years. Yeah,
01:28:12 long years and long tail and like I couldn't I couldn't have that with any of those properly.
01:28:18 So, yeah, then I found gerboa and then all my prayers were answered.
01:28:22 Well, if there was ever evidence of God, there it is, everybody. And Tom and Tom, I think I'm
01:28:29 thinking guerrilla. I'm thinking a guerrilla. A powerful beast. Oh, I think you're on the right
01:28:33 track. I think like a like what's the what's the long monkey? There's like a long monkey. There's a
01:28:38 long monkey. What's a given? A orangutan. You know, I could see Tom as like a lemur.
01:28:52 Okay, I don't think I don't think orangutan hits. Well, okay. Well, what does Tom think though?
01:28:58 I literally never thought of this before. So you're all in floor informing me very deeply right
01:29:04 as like a dust skull. I'm not I'm not I'm not dust skull. I'm not opposed to lemur lemur would
01:29:11 be kind of cool. I was all I was going to say was my favorite my favorite animals are crows. I
01:29:17 find crows fascinating. I can see ravens and crows are cool as shit. I can say you'd be a raven
01:29:24 because that's like the fucking raven that's so like fucking big. Yeah, I like the bigger versions
01:29:29 of crows, right? I think crows are bigger. Oh my god. Guys, this literally looks like Tom. Hold on.
01:29:36 This is Tom. That I mean, I see a result. I opened up discord and saw the heart Hopkinsville
01:29:42 goblins. Got it. All right, let's get on the fucking questions. All right. Okay, draw us as our first
01:29:53 is everyone. Yes, please. All right, yo, Twitter at TP Crasnators. Follow us for announcements
01:29:59 of stuff. And yo, here's a question. Hashtag ask bcp. Send questions using the hashtag. Okay,
01:30:04 here we go. Now here's one that was reading and I like this one. Okay, here we go. It's at chaotic
01:30:09 sloth an old patron of mine. What's up, buddy says up in your own opinion. Do you have to like a person
01:30:14 to be able to like their content? And for some reason, he adds animations don't count. I don't
01:30:19 know why he would throw that in the trash. Throw that in the trash. Yeah, what is different? What
01:30:26 at all is different? Okay, mage, what do you think? What do you think? The reason he mentioned is
01:30:32 because of the recent controversy in the anime community with Princess molestia getting her
01:30:38 own anime at a long last. It's like the guy who made that really cute over Rony Kenshin or whatever,
01:30:45 right? Like it was just a sugar cube. All right, sorry. I'm more recent one. Like, oh yeah,
01:30:55 I'm a mo junkie. That anime. Oh, what did he do? What did he do? One of the directors, like, I think
01:31:02 he's like confirmed to be an actual Nazi. And he's denying an actual Nazi for what? Yeah, I mean,
01:31:13 I get in, he's denying the Holocaust. Oh, who hasn't denied the Holocaust? You know what's
01:31:18 interesting about that? That is so weird of a thing to even know about an anime director. Like,
01:31:25 how many anime directors do you know any element of their personality? Because the controversy
01:31:32 was so big it reached me and I hate that. There was a huge Twitter snap. He publicly just kept
01:31:38 doing it on Twitter. Even if this is a thing that happened, I still don't see why it merits an
01:31:45 exception for animation. And Ben means the Holocaust. I'm not surprised about this. So,
01:31:52 is it the anime director and not like the American? I'm not surprised that an old Japanese man would
01:31:58 deny the Holocaust at all. I'd be surprised if most of them even know what it is. He's not that
01:32:02 old. It can't be that old. I mean, the Japanese and the Germans were allies. That's like saying
01:32:08 your best friend from back in the day killed a bunch of Jews. I'm looking this up. I mean,
01:32:12 how do they know? Nobody fucking knows anything. I don't know. You know what's funny about this,
01:32:17 though? It's interesting to note that, by the way, it is the director. It's Kazuyoshi Yaginuma.
01:32:26 But it's interesting to note that at long last, it seems like anime maker people
01:32:32 like the people who nobody has given a shit about in the West, Japan's a pretty right-wing conservative,
01:32:40 especially with immigration and stuff and race issues. At long last, people are starting to
01:32:46 care about what they think and they're finally facing some backlash. I think I had a moment
01:32:54 actually a while back where I was like, you know, I'm really excited about the fact that
01:32:58 all these animators and everything are on Twitter and we have more open communication.
01:33:02 But this cannot take long before this leads to something like this. And I just didn't expect
01:33:09 someone to come out as a fucking holocaust to die. Well, let's do this. Listen to this. Okay,
01:33:13 quote from Kazuyoshi. Here it is. One bit September 8th, 2012. Have you looked into
01:33:19 whether Anne Frank's diary is real? Oh, no. I mean, I haven't. I haven't.
01:33:28 I love you, Jesus Christ. This guy's a big Utermilk hotel fan, for sure. Well, that's something.
01:33:39 Jesus Christ, I love you.
01:33:51 In the airplane over the seam, I do. I had heard of this, but I haven't looked into it very much.
01:33:57 And I just want to say that like, just because you deny the holocaust does not actually make
01:34:01 you a Nazi. I'm just putting that out there. You could be an anti-Semite. You can hate the Jews.
01:34:05 I'm not putting that on you. But also, Japan, if you recall, everybody, Japan had a pretty
01:34:14 cozy relationship with the Nazis back in the day. So they've been across the board pretty forgiving.
01:34:19 I feel like holocaust and Nile is probably pretty rampant.
01:34:24 It's probably rampant across a lot of the world outside of America and Europe.
01:34:28 They did Nan King, man. Yeah, Nan King was like a nightmare.
01:34:34 The Nan King incident, as they recall.
01:34:38 Fuck, I forgot what I was going to goddamn say. I kept talking about the fucking Nan King shit.
01:34:44 Well, I mean, regardless, I think once this Pandora's Box open and we start to actually judge
01:34:49 like Japanese creators by their opinions, I think that is Pandora's Box.
01:34:55 I was going to say, to answer the actual fucking question,
01:34:58 yes, I think you could enjoy art regardless of the creator, but it really depends on the
01:35:05 piece because sometimes you feel like the creature, like sometimes I look at something like Ruroni
01:35:10 Kenshin. I don't think the original manga is even all that good, but like the offshoots of it,
01:35:15 clearly there's no influence of this guy's being a fucking pedophile on Ruroni Kenshin,
01:35:21 other than maybe there's like a couple of cute younger characters. There's not even really
01:35:25 any lollies in it. There's a couple of minor ass characters. They are cute though, but like
01:35:32 the series, you don't have to think about that when watching Ruroni Kenshin. It's not going
01:35:37 to strike you. You're not going to watch a scene and be like, oh, this totally reminds
01:35:41 me of the fact that he was a pedophile, but there's other stuff like some music, for instance,
01:35:46 where the musician is so baked into the song that if you don't like them as a person,
01:35:54 it's unavoidable when you're listening to the music that you're being hit with their
01:35:58 personality basically. It's going to remind you of the things you don't like about though.
01:36:03 Yeah, you also have to keep in mind that a lot of mediums are made by more than just one person,
01:36:07 for instance, that anime that I said. He's just a director. He's like a whole
01:36:11 slew of people working on that anime. Just because he's, let's say, a scumbag, doesn't mean
01:36:18 no, you have to shame the anime. That's a fair point. That is a fair point. I haven't seen it,
01:36:23 but I believe you. A lot of people have said that it's quite good, and the main character
01:36:29 reminds me of you. The director didn't make the source material of it anyway. It's not his story.
01:36:37 It's fair to criticize the man himself if you strongly disagree with him,
01:36:41 and you can choose to not want to. Well, that's the thing. But are you supporting him so much?
01:36:47 If you are supporting him by supporting his work, and if so, does that support his belief
01:36:51 structure? I honestly don't think it would even be possible to support that guy by buying the
01:36:57 work, because for what it's worth, first of all, it's not how anime works. If you buy a
01:37:02 Blu-ray, it doesn't just put money in the director's pocket. And second of all, that
01:37:05 dude's probably going to get fired and blacklisted at this point. Who knows how Japan works with
01:37:11 stuff. Japan is just very anti-PR at anything. The fact that he has bugs around him is the
01:37:18 problem. It's not what he said. It's that you can't be a controversial figure.
01:37:24 The question, I think the answer to this is obviously, yes, you can enjoy work. But that
01:37:29 doesn't mean that you always will be able to or even want to. If the politics leak into the work,
01:37:37 and you don't like them, it's going to be hard to ignore. At that point, you hate the product,
01:37:41 not the person. Who did not just use you, for example, did you? Sure, your anime essays could
01:37:48 be those standalone, but they do require people to know about you and lead to you, the person.
01:37:57 I mean, it really depends. I mean, I've always kept the main channel relatively clean in certain
01:38:05 ways. I don't run around saying nigga constantly on that channel. The way I see it, I want people
01:38:14 who wouldn't be okay with that to be able to enjoy my videos so that I can cast a wider net,
01:38:19 so that I can make more money. When you come to the side channels, I don't give a fuck, because
01:38:26 ultimately, I would rather just do whatever I want than be an acceptable artist on any level.
01:38:32 In order to maintain making money from a larger amount of people who I am deliberately dooping,
01:38:39 like I'm deliberately not showing them the entire picture of myself, as most people don't. Most
01:38:45 people don't show you everything about themselves, even if it's something that is public about them
01:38:51 in another way. On the internet, all those things kind of bleed together if they're all under the
01:38:56 same name. And you can call that dooping, but really, no matter what situation we're in, there
01:39:02 are things that we choose to offer and choose to not offer in a given situation. Would you not call
01:39:08 that dooping? Well, it's more just withholding information that you don't need. People who
01:39:16 watch the Otaku Gaza Journalist channel don't need to know that I'm a guy, a white boy who says
01:39:21 niggah all the time. That is irrelevant to those videos that I'd prefer they just not think about
01:39:26 it. I'm not saying that it is dooping. I don't think it is, but I would think that Nate would
01:39:31 think it is. I'm surprised that he doesn't. Technically, you could call that dooping,
01:39:37 but it's just if you call that dooping, you have to define basically every human interaction as
01:39:43 also dooping to some degree. Didn't we talk about how you consider every human action deceit?
01:39:48 Yes, and this is exactly that issue. I think what he's saying is that the word dooping would
01:39:53 lose meaning if we applied it to all. Then why is holding an open the door for someone deceit?
01:40:03 We're talking about degrees here. We're talking about degrees. Is this the part of the episode
01:40:07 where we have to splice in all of the weird utilitarian episodes? Please splice it in, everybody.
01:40:12 God damn it. Well, okay, I think we've basically covered this question. So,
01:40:16 chaotic sloth, thanks for the good one. That was a juicy one. That was a hashtag,
01:40:20 not bad question from Twitter. Hashtag. This is from the Patreon lounge. Donate any amount to
01:40:26 get into the Patreon lounge and you can answer the exclusive questions. Patreon.com is like
01:40:28 the procrastinators. Yes. This is about Julian my Julian. How do we get closer to PCPHQ? What
01:40:34 does the roadmap look like to that? Well, the roadmap is wait for digits to move and then it,
01:40:40 yeah, throw money and just wait. Yeah, I mean, like some of us are just already like,
01:40:44 I'm moving very soon because I have to move at the end of May. Like there's no question about that
01:40:50 and my plan is move to Boston because I mean, at this point, I like it's too late to even change
01:40:55 plans. So, so we're going to Boston. Make the best of it. Yeah. And I mean, Tom's already there.
01:41:01 Munchie's already planning to go there. You know, it wouldn't be hard for if Nate decides he's,
01:41:07 you know, ready to finally leave his job, then that's probably where he's going. So like,
01:41:11 it's just kind of a matter of time. But if you want to grease the wheels and make sure that it
01:41:16 actually happens and nothing fucks up, keep throwing money at us because we need the money to
01:41:20 make it happen. I mean, PCPHQ is entirely a financial issue. Yeah, that's correct. That's
01:41:27 correct. Yeah. I mean, yeah, everybody, I don't expect anybody to go way out of their way. And
01:41:31 like, I don't, I generally dislike the idea of like giving money for like future projects that
01:41:37 aren't specifically being promised. Like I certainly wouldn't give it. I mean, you got to think of
01:41:40 yourselves as a production committee and are you willing to take a risk on a product you want
01:41:47 to see exist? Like if you spend that money now, you're making an investment towards the idea that
01:41:52 a type of content you think you want, at the very least, might come to fruition. Will you be horribly
01:41:58 disappointed? It's possible. But like, yeah, sure. I mean, that's a perfectly fine way to think about
01:42:04 and like, again, everyone's making a personal decision, whether they give to a patron or not,
01:42:07 and for what reasons. And we have specifically stated that like one of our intentions is to make
01:42:12 PCPHQ happen. If we had more money, we could start making steps in that direction. I'll tell you
01:42:16 right now, for me, the thing that is holding me back from currently going charging all speed ahead
01:42:22 is purely like the need to or like leaving my job is the thing I need to do and being financially
01:42:28 stable. So when I can earn enough money to make sure that's safe and frankly, I'm probably going
01:42:32 to depend on that like whatever whatever that income is, like the portion I get from the PCP
01:42:37 and the portion I get on my own, like that needs to be at a certain level where I think like,
01:42:40 okay, I can I can do this. And you know, it's become a reality that like I'm pretty pretty,
01:42:46 it's not that I'm comfortable at my job, but like, it's got me in a situation where I'm making
01:42:51 enough money that I can keep building up my savings for a while. So to me, I think the logical thing
01:42:56 to do is either my just income on YouTube stuff just goes way up and looks like it's going to stay
01:43:00 that way for a while, or I like work for a while longer, save up more money so that I can take
01:43:06 that risk and you know, jump out there and I'd like to do it as soon as possible. It's all I'm
01:43:10 saying. Do you have any timeframe just for art? I was really hoping it would be in 2018. Looking
01:43:17 at the math, I don't know if that's actually exactly right. So I guess I'd say my hope is like
01:43:24 early 2019. That's my current thoughts, but I have to play it by ear. I have to play it by
01:43:29 ear. All the other questions in the patron lounge are like terrible. How about this question from
01:43:36 Bobby Meow 13? Here's the question, freemium games pay to win mechanics? Question mark?
01:43:42 Um, yes. Yes. Exactly. Yes. Thank you. What's your persona? Wait, okay. Here's one. Here's
01:43:56 one that Cyrus asks, do you think Kanye West is a furry because he always portrays as a bear in his
01:44:01 old album? It was embarrassed by it and didn't read it out loud. There you go. I just wanted to
01:44:07 say Kanye because he's a good boy. I'm looking forward to the new album. Hurry up, boy. This is,
01:44:12 I'm looking at the list of questions. Yeah, I know. It's really upsetting. Giffy thoughts on
01:44:17 passivism. Moving on. We got a question from Hippocrite. Where's Carcat? He's right here.
01:44:29 Carcat, why don't you say something? There's no reason we can't just all have three questions
01:44:34 at the show, right? Like, we can just do that. You know, he's right. We can do whatever we want.
01:44:39 Fuck you guys. Ask him better questions if you want to be read on the goddamn show.
01:44:43 That's perfectly good. Perfectly good. Why is it every episode the proof becomes more and more
01:44:48 evident that you can have wit and you can have, or you can have money, but you can't have both?
01:44:54 Yeah, well, fair enough. I think they just try to rush to be like, to like ask as fast as possible
01:44:59 without like, I mean, the reality is they've got an hour and a half. Yeah, yeah. Bruh on it for
01:45:05 a while, guys. Maybe they think we ask right before we start the section or something. Yeah,
01:45:09 we should clarify that for everybody. Just so you know, if you're asking a question either on
01:45:12 Twitter or on the Discord, you have at least an hour for when the message goes out to form
01:45:18 like, because we do the whole episode. In fact, you're actually probably, you're better off waiting,
01:45:23 because if you respond to our tweet right when we post it, we're not going to dig back and see it,
01:45:29 because we're only going to ask a question. It's better to wait like an hour and a half at least
01:45:32 before you respond to it. At least an hour. Well, I mean, usually we take most of our stuff from
01:45:37 the Discord, but like, they do usually like the first 10 minutes after we post a question,
01:45:42 a bunch of shitty questions get posted that everybody shuts up and it's like, well,
01:45:47 that wasn't helpful. Let me ask you about this, guys. The Q&A is like almost always terrible.
01:45:54 No, I disagree. I totally disagree. Yeah.
01:45:58 I was going to ask, like, what's the point of it? It's funny and entertaining is the point for me.
01:46:08 I think we always choose good questions. They're just rarely our ones to find.
01:46:14 Okay, when there are good questions, it is nice. But I feel like every episode is just like,
01:46:18 look at how bad these questions are. I mean, we always say that while we're looking for good ones.
01:46:22 This is why we need to do questioner rules. We've talked about this a few times here and there.
01:46:29 Why are we talking shop on the middle of the show?
01:46:36 At TP Crasnators, that's the Twitter. Check it out for announcements and all kinds of stuff.
01:46:40 Patreon.com slash TheProCrasnators. One dollar gets into the lounge where you can get your
01:46:44 questions in and we'll fucking see them more likely. And $5 gets you all the bonus episodes.
01:46:49 There's like 12 now. There's a huge library being built. And they're all pretty fucking great.
01:46:56 To clarify, there's 12 and you get them all. I don't know if everybody understands this,
01:46:59 but when you have a patron reward, you get all of it. So like when you patron DigiBro,
01:47:06 you get like hundreds of hours of commentaries of me and DeVoo watching back all of my videos.
01:47:11 That's enough personal shilling, you fucking bitch. I'm definitely editing that out.
01:47:17 Oh, excellent. But that's it, everybody. Thanks for joining. We will see you next week
01:47:21 and stay tuned. Everybody give us money for the new bonus episode. We'll tell you about it next
01:47:26 time. All right, thanks for being around and we'll see you next time. Bye.
01:47:33 I am a furry. I love Anthrocon. See you at Anthrocon. See you at Anthrocon. Yeah.
01:47:40 Yeah. Yeah.
