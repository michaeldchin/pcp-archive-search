00:00:00 Welcome everyone to PCP Destructive Criticism.
00:00:10 Just whenever there's someone who is a PCP viewer, or any other correspondent of any of us, or potentially even one of us, who has made a thing that isn't a video, especially a video game that can be played.
00:00:22 This is a series now, even though this is just an impromptu idea we just had.
00:00:28 Hypothetically, it may happen again in the future, so we have to make it a series now. We have to capitalize on the future potential.
00:00:34 So this is Nemesis.
00:00:36 We're playing Nemesis, a game by what's his name?
00:00:38 I don't remember. Well, I think on social media he's just called Nemesis Admins. We'll just call him Nemesis Admins.
00:00:44 Well, this game is on Newgrounds, but it's also at www.nemesis-game.com.
00:00:50 He sent a message to Digi saying, yo, I've been listening to the PCP.
00:00:54 Of course he messaged Digi. What a fucking pleb.
00:00:58 A pleb tier PCP viewer.
00:01:02 And he said that listening to your show gave me the motivation to finish it, or to really finish working on his project.
00:01:10 To not be one of those average suck boys who just sits around and doesn't actually do the work to make the shit happen.
00:01:16 That's fair.
00:01:18 Actually, this is the third weapon.
00:01:22 I won't get into specifics about what we can talk about.
00:01:24 Right now, Ben is playing, and I'm just here next to the microphone.
00:01:28 We're too lazy to actually record the video. This is mostly for the guy who made the game.
00:01:32 If you want to experience the game while we talk, you can just go play it.
00:01:36 Go visit the website if you would.
00:01:38 We figure the guy who made the game knows the game well enough that he can just feel in the blanks.
00:01:42 He'll know what we're talking about.
00:01:44 The reason why I wanted to give this guy direct feedback, or open letter feedback, is because it's professionally presented enough.
00:01:52 And the guy seems like professionally in his dialogue.
00:01:56 Seems like he's pretty serious about it, which is cool.
00:02:00 And will be accepting to people talking about it and giving notes.
00:02:06 So fucking...
00:02:10 How do I begin?
00:02:12 This game is very similar to a Lambria game.
00:02:16 The designer himself said, like, yes, this is basically a Luftraus.
00:02:22 I was annoyed because in his messages, the one that I saw you quoting, he didn't say anything about Luftraus.
00:02:28 And I was like, well, this is just Luftraus.
00:02:32 That's fine. Whatever.
00:02:36 Gotta start somewhere.
00:02:38 I would totally advise that if you're making games, just rip one off completely.
00:02:42 Yeah, sure, that's fine.
00:02:44 If you're gonna make a guitar song, you gotta play someone else's song 5,000 times so you can get an idea of how it works.
00:02:50 Absolutely, of course.
00:02:52 If it's a game thrown up for free, then you're essentially ripping off Lambria.
00:02:56 So that's two birds one stone, right?
00:02:58 Yeah.
00:03:00 So for someone who hasn't played Luftrausers, I immediately jump in and I'm like, this is fucking impossible.
00:03:06 Yeah.
00:03:08 Well, of course it's impossible. It's a game where you just go until you die.
00:03:12 So you always die.
00:03:14 It's just a question of how long.
00:03:16 That's the tricky point for me is that I'm not into games like that.
00:03:20 It's just sort of fundamentally.
00:03:22 So basically there's two goals for me, which is talk about what the game is like from the perspective of someone like me,
00:03:26 and then talk about trying to hone in on what I think the dev is going for.
00:03:32 I don't fucking know.
00:03:34 I think it's gonna be a super annoying demographic and just know what I think, right?
00:03:38 Yeah, just completely not the target audience for this game.
00:03:42 Not completely not. I don't hate these kinds of games. I just don't get that into them.
00:03:46 You are much more the target demographic for this game.
00:03:50 Yeah, I never went crazy for Luftrausers or anything.
00:03:54 I didn't buy the final version, but yeah, it is the sort of game that I'm generally into.
00:03:58 The fact that you didn't immediately...
00:04:00 Holy shit!
00:04:02 We just got to a giant fucking...
00:04:04 A new fucking thing has appeared.
00:04:06 We just got to a giant flail? We didn't see that before.
00:04:08 It's just getting intense now.
00:04:10 Like I said, I have not really played Luftrausers.
00:04:12 I don't know if this thing is just taken from Luftrausers or not.
00:04:14 What? This is like...
00:04:16 They keep fading in and out, too.
00:04:18 This is an interesting enemy. I'm sure it's taken from something.
00:04:22 This is two out of nowhere.
00:04:24 It's too much like Luftrausers.
00:04:26 I don't know. I didn't see anything like that in Luftrausers, but I'm sure.
00:04:30 Just like that one time where the main character in one piece was picking out pants, that was Luftrausers.
00:04:34 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:04:36 Gotcha.
00:04:38 So the fact that you didn't immediately gawk at how weak your weapon was like I did?
00:04:44 No, yeah, I did.
00:04:46 This is too fucking...
00:04:48 No, I did. That was my first thing.
00:04:50 The first plane has a main weapon that is completely worthless.
00:04:54 But I don't know. Maybe that's intentional.
00:04:56 Probably not.
00:04:58 Well, this is one of those games where you've got 15 minutes to get in and get out because it's on new grounds.
00:05:02 You're going to lose interest immediately.
00:05:04 That doesn't make any sense.
00:05:06 That has nothing to do with whether the main weapon is too weak or not.
00:05:10 What I thought was like...
00:05:12 He was saying that just in relation to the difficulty in general.
00:05:16 I get that it's supposed to be hard.
00:05:20 For me personally, I generally prefer video games where the first time you dive into the mechanics
00:05:26 everything just sort of pre-scripted works correctly.
00:05:30 So that you know how things are supposed to go.
00:05:32 Because when I first played it and I immediately died, I was like wait, did I do something wrong?
00:05:36 I wasn't sure.
00:05:38 That's just you not getting it.
00:05:40 Well, I did get it. It took me two extra minutes to get it.
00:05:44 Again, this is different.
00:05:46 Me personally, I do have the patience if I decide to sit down with a game.
00:05:50 So consider the giant swathes of people who will in fact click away after 30 seconds, right?
00:05:56 To make that really great first impression.
00:05:58 Well, this game is not for that.
00:06:00 Okay, well, this video is not for that.
00:06:02 But if it is, then there you go, right?
00:06:06 Because I don't think there'd be any harm in just like you have this starting wave of enemies
00:06:10 that shows up that are obviously super easy and weak.
00:06:12 And then they get knocked out in one hit by your thing.
00:06:16 And then the actual challenge begins.
00:06:18 Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit poking me with your thing.
00:06:21 Sorry, totally unrelated.
00:06:23 I wasn't fucking...
00:06:25 I just wasn't sure what to do at first.
00:06:27 Because I wasn't sure if it was going to be one of those games you got to get to an objective goal.
00:06:31 If you got to shoot down a certain number of dudes.
00:06:33 Because there's no score either.
00:06:35 At least not on the screen, right?
00:06:37 You only see the number of enemies you kill at the end.
00:06:39 So I just didn't know what to do.
00:06:41 Which also brings me to the fact that the screen is very barren.
00:06:44 It's not barren.
00:06:46 Well, look, there's nothing on the screen right now.
00:06:48 Yeah, because it just started.
00:06:50 Soon there will be huge swarms of planes and bullets and shit all flying around.
00:06:56 I don't know, man. Some of your criticisms seem a little weird so far.
00:07:00 I like density. I'm far of hashtag density core.
00:07:05 What are you talking about?
00:07:07 Give me one minute and you will see the screen will become dense with shit.
00:07:10 Yeah, and I'm just saying that you have rounds of this game,
00:07:14 sessions of this game that last three minutes,
00:07:16 and the first minute is going to be mostly empty.
00:07:18 So that's 30% of the game that's mostly empty.
00:07:21 That's like an RPG with 30% empty corridors.
00:07:24 The better you get at the game, the longer you'll last,
00:07:28 and proportionally the less time you'll spend in the boring first 30 seconds.
00:07:34 I guess.
00:07:36 I don't really see what the advantage is though of having sort of a barren first 30 seconds.
00:07:42 What's the alternative?
00:07:45 Just having more interesting shit go on.
00:07:47 Just have it start immediately?
00:07:49 I guess it could get going faster.
00:07:51 Yeah, probably there's nothing...
00:07:54 Oh, I get hurt if I go out into space.
00:07:56 Yeah, it would probably be fine if it started up faster.
00:08:00 Because once you've played a little bit, you don't really need to fuck around with the first...
00:08:05 But really, it's like 30 of them at once.
00:08:09 This third plane has a really good weapon for that.
00:08:11 We'll get to that in a bit.
00:08:13 Yeah, I guess in principle I agree that the faster it gets going, the better.
00:08:19 But whatever, it's really not that bad.
00:08:21 Yeah, I guess you're right.
00:08:23 Now that I'm seeing how far we're able to get in, and now there's just a bunch of shit,
00:08:26 then that's pretty reasonable.
00:08:28 But my point is, compared to Loot Browsers, that game has more stuff going on immediately.
00:08:33 Or at least it's got a smaller screen.
00:08:35 It's got a smaller field of view.
00:08:37 It's also hung up on the barrenness of the screen.
00:08:39 The size of the screen is an advantage.
00:08:41 I like that better than Loot Browsers because it just lets you concede more and you can play smarter.
00:08:46 I guess I'm not trying to propose the idea that it's bad.
00:08:48 I just want it to be something that is considered.
00:08:50 I want to know how much was it intentional.
00:08:52 I think it is a good design choice to make the screen proportionally bigger.
00:08:56 I guess my point is, I just want it to be something that is kept in mind.
00:08:59 Because barrenness and too small a screen was the number one pitfall that I fell into when I made an RPG.
00:09:06 Where everything was so fucking small.
00:09:08 This is not an RPG. This was working totally differently.
00:09:12 Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
00:09:14 I just thought, was the dev keeping that in mind when making it?
00:09:17 That's why I'm bringing it up.
00:09:22 So let's talk about the second weapon for the second plane.
00:09:26 Hang on, there's three planes.
00:09:29 Before we get into that, I want to say that I do really like the opening screen.
00:09:33 It's like a pilot console and you have to hit all the buttons that the game requires you to use.
00:09:41 That unlocks the console and then you can get started.
00:09:44 I don't know, it's just neat.
00:09:47 It's neat because you just gotta press the buttons and now you know the buttons.
00:09:52 For me, that was also confusing. It gave me this first 30 seconds.
00:09:55 Wait, how does this thing work?
00:09:57 It was awesome. It was unequivocally great and I love that.
00:10:04 If I'm going into a video game and I know for a fact I'm going to give it a really long trial period.
00:10:10 Let's say everyone in my circle is saying it's amazing.
00:10:13 Then something like that is great because I've been given the promise that extra effort is going to be worth it.
00:10:19 It's not extra effort to press four buttons to start the game.
00:10:22 You're just not sure what the buttons are going to mean, right?
00:10:25 That's what the point of it is, is that it shows you the buttons and it prompts you like these are the buttons and these are what they do.
00:10:32 Now hit them in order to start the game up.
00:10:35 It feels like powering on a console.
00:10:39 I like it. I like it. I like it. I do.
00:10:45 You see the screen you're on right now? You're on the main screen.
00:10:48 It took me a while to realize that those blue lights in the middle don't do anything.
00:10:54 They're just denoting the different volume levels.
00:10:57 In fact, they're lined up symmetrically right next to the level selection buttons.
00:11:00 It made me think that they were inherently coupled somehow.
00:11:03 Then a little bit later, I was like, oh, okay, so there we go.
00:11:07 Over there is basically unrelated.
00:11:09 Those buttons over there is the volume choices.
00:11:11 The stuff on the right is the level options, right?
00:11:16 Once again, I guess I'm basically framing these problems, but more queries or more statements, I guess,
00:11:23 where obviously leading players into confusion or forcing them to get outside of their comfort zone
00:11:30 to do an old thing in a new way has a lot of value,
00:11:33 but it should be done very consciously, and you know exactly what kind of misconstruions
00:11:38 and confusions you're going to put the player on, right?
00:11:41 So you can manipulate them better.
00:11:43 You don't necessarily want to send them into a confused tizzy unintentionally,
00:11:48 because then that might not be a good experience, right?
00:11:50 Well, I suppose not. I don't think that's what's happening here.
00:11:54 I'm just saying that, like, I don't know.
00:11:56 And I guess as a general principle, I would agree with you,
00:12:00 that you're confusing the players bad and you shouldn't do this.
00:12:02 Well, I'm just saying that, like, just know what will cause confusion.
00:12:06 Okay.
00:12:07 Because I remember, like...
00:12:08 Well, I eat nothing in this game. Nothing in this game would do that, but okay.
00:12:11 Well, like, you know, 10 seconds of, hmm, what's this, right?
00:12:15 Which, you know, in a game that, like, as he says, you'd play for 15 minutes,
00:12:18 that comprises, like, 5% of the whole game experience.
00:12:22 So it is very relevant, you know?
00:12:24 No, it isn't. You're totally out of line and you're totally off base.
00:12:28 You just flip through games, like, in the span of minutes, you know?
00:12:31 It very much happens.
00:12:32 People could, like, watch a Let's Play and they might click away in 2 minutes,
00:12:35 based on the experience the Let's Player has.
00:12:37 It's a really tight market, you know?
00:12:39 You have to really, really work and manipulate the player to command their attention.
00:12:44 I... I guess.
00:12:46 Yeah. So...
00:12:48 You know, it may as well if you're gonna put lots of work into it.
00:12:52 So what would you...
00:12:53 Okay, if you could change something, if you could change something about this game
00:12:56 and deviate this issue, what would you do?
00:12:58 Uh, I would probably put, like, a little graphical separation line
00:13:02 between the volume options and then the level selections
00:13:05 and maybe I'd make them a slightly different color.
00:13:07 Right?
00:13:08 Okay.
00:13:09 Yeah.
00:13:10 I remember in the Art of Game design, the Book of Lenses,
00:13:12 there's one part where the author talks about how he was making, like, an Aladdin game,
00:13:15 where you're riding off flying carpet.
00:13:17 And, like, there's a part where you get up into, like, a big chamber
00:13:19 and you're supposed to go straight to, like, a throne area in this throne room.
00:13:23 Now, the players would always go up into that room
00:13:25 and just wander around not knowing where to go.
00:13:27 And so he put a fucking line on the floor that leads to the throne
00:13:32 and everyone will always go to the throne immediately, right?
00:13:35 Sure.
00:13:36 But then in co-op mode, uh, they wanted to make it to where people wouldn't all go to the throne
00:13:40 because only one person can grab the scepter,
00:13:42 so they wanted everyone to just sort of...
00:13:44 They wanted one person to go to the throne and everyone else to hang out, right?
00:13:47 So they drew a line that goes to the throne
00:13:49 and then splits off into three random directions.
00:13:52 The three players in co-op would always split off into random directions
00:13:55 with those lines on the floor that none of them consciously noticed, you know?
00:13:58 So it's all about manipulation of the player.
00:14:01 Yeah.
00:14:02 Um, you know, just stuff to keep in mind.
00:14:04 Okay.
00:14:05 But so, for ref, we're just talking about the opening menu.
00:14:09 We're just talking about the menu screen right now.
00:14:11 Yeah, man.
00:14:12 Okay.
00:14:13 If the menu feels good, the game feels good.
00:14:15 That's not...
00:14:16 Wait, I don't... Who said that?
00:14:18 That guy who remixes everything that we say into weird shitpost videos.
00:14:22 Oh, was that Steve?
00:14:24 Yeah.
00:14:25 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:14:26 So anyway, uh...
00:14:28 Well, yeah, we were going to talk about the weapons.
00:14:30 So the opening weapon of the game.
00:14:31 See, I just feel so demoralized when I start up the game for the first minute
00:14:34 because I feel like the weapon isn't even doing shit, right?
00:14:36 Yeah, my...
00:14:38 Well, my first...
00:14:40 My first criticism of the game is that it is Luth Trousers,
00:14:43 which I think is a comprehensive...
00:14:45 which I think says all I need to say.
00:14:48 But...
00:14:49 Okay, but I know that I'm seen as some sort of pariah
00:14:53 because I believe in originality and I think that it's valuable.
00:14:56 Like I'm some kind of moron or something.
00:14:58 But...
00:14:59 Okay, so I'm just going to leave that one.
00:15:00 I'm just going to leave that where it lies.
00:15:02 My only other criticism...
00:15:04 Well, my second criticism is that, yeah,
00:15:06 the first plane has two weapons.
00:15:08 There's like a spread fire shotgun machine gun,
00:15:12 although it doesn't fire that fast,
00:15:14 and a laser beam.
00:15:16 And they're both underpowered,
00:15:18 but the first one is underpowered to the point.
00:15:21 The main weapon is useless and I never used it.
00:15:24 It's unbelievably terrible.
00:15:26 Like I did not kill anything with it.
00:15:28 Yeah, and then you basically...
00:15:30 I think if you just play one round with the first plane,
00:15:32 you can then go back to the main menu and unlock the second plane
00:15:35 and then the third plane,
00:15:36 and they each have in turn more powerful weapons than the last.
00:15:39 I liked the second plane better than the first,
00:15:42 and I liked the third plane better than the second.
00:15:44 Although the third plane is like...
00:15:46 Overpowered almost.
00:15:48 Yeah, I think it's probably a little overpowered,
00:15:50 and also it just feels really different.
00:15:52 It's a totally different kind of game.
00:15:54 The third plane does not feel...
00:15:55 I'm not actually shooting anything.
00:15:56 All I'm doing is leading planes behind me
00:15:58 and then sort of leaving this mine in the air
00:16:00 that they just run into.
00:16:02 It's like a buzzsaw boomerang.
00:16:04 It is.
00:16:05 It's really cool.
00:16:06 It's pretty cool, I like it.
00:16:07 I love fucking games where you have a variety of weapons,
00:16:10 each with their own totally different mechanic, right?
00:16:13 That's a good game I like,
00:16:14 so I like it when things get outside of the general zone
00:16:17 of shooting on a straight vector, right?
00:16:20 Yeah, but it kind of makes me wonder
00:16:22 why this game is a game about flying a plane around and shooting,
00:16:26 but by far the best time I'm having with it,
00:16:29 I'm not actually shooting.
00:16:31 I feel like a game about that boomerang
00:16:34 would be much better.
00:16:36 I think if there's one thing...
00:16:38 If this is an experimental game,
00:16:40 just kind of made, oh fuck, I ran into a deadly thing.
00:16:43 Okay, if this game is an experiment
00:16:45 and this guy is, I assume, a pretty new dev
00:16:48 and he's probably just trying things out
00:16:50 and figuring out what works,
00:16:51 I think what really works is that boomerang,
00:16:53 I think, is the lesson that he might want to take away from this.
00:16:56 Indeed.
00:16:57 That's my opinion.
00:16:58 Yeah.
00:16:59 Oh yeah, another tricky thing
00:17:02 about the game's design that misled me
00:17:04 is that I didn't realize that if you went back to the main menu
00:17:06 you'd unlock more weapons, right?
00:17:08 Yeah, the new planes.
00:17:09 Right, you'd unlock the new planes,
00:17:11 because you have to go back to the main menu to do that.
00:17:13 And for me personally,
00:17:14 I would have probably just been stuck in a loop
00:17:16 playing with the first plane.
00:17:17 I would have too.
00:17:18 Over and over again if Digi hadn't mentioned it, right?
00:17:20 Yeah.
00:17:21 So my thought is...
00:17:22 Yeah, I think it should notify you when you unlock a new plane.
00:17:25 Which is really the reason why
00:17:27 I felt like I was a little bit too misled
00:17:29 by the confusion of the menu,
00:17:31 because you have to kind of know what that menu means
00:17:33 in order to understand this immediately.
00:17:34 Yeah, I think that a notification
00:17:36 when you unlock a new plane would be pretty good.
00:17:39 Right.
00:17:40 And for me it's like,
00:17:41 especially when you're on browser game level,
00:17:43 notifications basically should be translated
00:17:46 to shove something right in your fucking face.
00:17:48 Yeah, like why do you think all those mobile games
00:17:50 always have like a mascot character
00:17:52 on the bottom right corner of the screen
00:17:53 that like tells you everything,
00:17:55 just to make sure that you're not fucking missing it, right?
00:17:57 Yeah.
00:17:58 So I would say like have,
00:17:59 like in the middle of the screen,
00:18:00 like you got a new fucking plane, you know?
00:18:02 Yeah.
00:18:03 Especially because the game only really gets
00:18:05 more good and interesting when you get to the third one.
00:18:08 Yeah.
00:18:09 So you want to talk about the aesthetic of the game?
00:18:12 Well, the aesthetic of the game is just Luftrasse.
00:18:14 I guess.
00:18:15 But smaller.
00:18:16 Well, I guess I will say I like the cityscape.
00:18:19 I like the cityscape underneath.
00:18:21 I like the parallax scrolling and I like the sun.
00:18:24 I like how the higher you go,
00:18:26 like there's this red sun in the background
00:18:28 and it like illuminates more of the city
00:18:30 because like it's shining on it more.
00:18:32 The dev here clearly has a grip on how to synthesize
00:18:37 the different multimedia elements, you know?
00:18:40 Like he's able to put the different graphics together
00:18:42 and they weave around in an interesting way.
00:18:44 I mean, I guess I would say that differently.
00:18:47 I would say that he's just got a reasonably good sense
00:18:50 of aesthetic design.
00:18:51 Yeah, just how to make the fucking,
00:18:53 because none of the individual graphics
00:18:54 are that impressive, right?
00:18:55 They're really consistent too.
00:18:57 Although, you know, I, well,
00:18:59 okay, I was going to say that it's a bit odd,
00:19:01 like the sun, it's odd, like the sun
00:19:04 really calls attention to itself.
00:19:06 Like I find myself looking at the sun
00:19:08 whenever I go up high because...
00:19:10 I think it's fucking cool, but it looks...
00:19:11 It is cool, but it commands so much of my attention
00:19:15 even though it's irrelevant to the actual gameplay.
00:19:18 I don't hate it, but I think it's odd.
00:19:20 Every element of the graphics,
00:19:21 they all look like a different art style.
00:19:23 Like the sun itself is like a perfectly circular,
00:19:25 like it's probably not even like a graphic,
00:19:27 it's probably just like in whatever language
00:19:29 they're programmed in, like they probably just use,
00:19:31 like straight up the program to make a circle.
00:19:34 That's what it looks like to me.
00:19:35 Could be.
00:19:36 Because it's so like anti-aliased.
00:19:38 And like the graphics of the weapons
00:19:41 and the enemies and you,
00:19:43 they all look like...
00:19:45 They look like loot browsers.
00:19:47 Then the cityscape looks sort of MS Paint-like.
00:19:51 You know, it looks a little sloppy and like unprofessional.
00:19:53 It looks cool, but it doesn't look like it was made
00:19:55 by an artist, if you know what I mean, right?
00:19:57 It doesn't...
00:19:58 I guess I would say that it's...
00:20:00 Well, you know what I don't like about it?
00:20:02 I don't like how it just cuts to black underneath.
00:20:05 Well, that's the water.
00:20:07 I know, I know.
00:20:08 Like the tops...
00:20:09 Okay, well, here's what I don't like.
00:20:10 The tops of the buildings, they feel...
00:20:13 Yeah, the perspective feels off because
00:20:15 the tops of the buildings are tilted down
00:20:17 as though you're looking at them from slightly above.
00:20:19 And yet the waterline is a perfect horizontal line
00:20:22 implying that you are looking at it exactly from the sideways.
00:20:26 So I feel like that doesn't quite work.
00:20:28 Yeah, and I think that the fucking battle ships
00:20:30 in particular have a lot of precise detail on them.
00:20:33 Like the way that they're lit up,
00:20:34 which I don't know if you're able to have the...
00:20:36 Fuck.
00:20:37 Being able to pay attention to even notice.
00:20:39 But see those ships, how much cool little details are on them?
00:20:42 The little lights on the side.
00:20:43 They kind of looked like they were drawn by a different person,
00:20:45 but probably just that the methodology he went into drawing
00:20:48 that was very different, where he probably modeled
00:20:50 the ships after photos of ships,
00:20:52 and he probably just drew some fucking buildings
00:20:55 to make it look like buildings, right?
00:20:57 Yeah.
00:20:58 I assume he probably wasn't looking at a cityscape
00:21:00 when he drew it.
00:21:02 Well, that's just what it comes off like, right?
00:21:04 It just feels like a different art style.
00:21:05 And particularly the clouds look like a cartoony
00:21:08 with a thick black outline.
00:21:10 So each element has a different art style, basically.
00:21:14 Which again, if you want to go for art style fusion,
00:21:17 again, not good, not bad, not great, not terrible,
00:21:20 not mediocre, just not a value judgment,
00:21:23 just a point, right?
00:21:24 Yeah.
00:21:25 To keep in mind the different cohesion,
00:21:27 the different art styles, you know,
00:21:29 how they can work off one another.
00:21:30 You know what?
00:21:31 I hate the second plane.
00:21:32 It's stupid.
00:21:33 It's stupid.
00:21:34 It's special.
00:21:35 It's got a machine gun, and its special ability
00:21:37 is that you can like,
00:21:38 Spin it around.
00:21:39 You can instantly reverse direction.
00:21:40 And if you do that, you die.
00:21:43 So it's just a kill me button.
00:21:45 Because you always have like a horde of planes
00:21:47 flying behind you.
00:21:48 I don't know.
00:21:49 Maybe there's some tricky strategy to use with it.
00:21:51 I thought that maybe it would be good for like,
00:21:53 flying down into ships,
00:21:55 because it's really hard to kill the ships.
00:21:57 The ships are positioned in a way that it's just,
00:21:59 it's just not natural to shoot them.
00:22:01 I thought maybe that like,
00:22:03 this would be a good plane for killing ships.
00:22:05 Okay, that kind of worked,
00:22:06 but then I got hit and almost died.
00:22:07 I kind of thought that maybe you could like,
00:22:09 swoop down at them firing,
00:22:11 and then like, before colliding with the ground,
00:22:13 you can like, immediately reverse your direction
00:22:15 and fly back up into the ship.
00:22:16 Oh, you got to kill the ship.
00:22:17 That actually worked.
00:22:18 Okay, I'm going to keep trying this.
00:22:19 It's still really awkward,
00:22:20 and I feel like I'm going to die every time I do it,
00:22:22 but okay.
00:22:23 Maybe I've hit on something here.
00:22:25 Oh man, didn't do it that time.
00:22:26 Okay, I'm going to try again.
00:22:27 I'm going back.
00:22:29 Fuck.
00:22:30 Oh, well, you got it.
00:22:31 Yeah, I got the ship, but I died,
00:22:33 because reversing direction
00:22:35 just puts you right in the path of death.
00:22:37 So my point is, I think this guy's got,
00:22:38 he definitely got all the baseline talent
00:22:40 to make a really good game.
00:22:41 I don't agree with that.
00:22:42 I don't agree with that.
00:22:43 He's got the baseline talent
00:22:44 to copy a really good game.
00:22:46 I don't know.
00:22:47 Look at that fucking skull.
00:22:48 That's exactly from Lufthrausers.
00:22:50 Lufthrausers does that exact thing.
00:22:52 When you die, it puts a skull on the screen.
00:22:54 What?
00:22:55 Yeah.
00:22:56 I told you this game is Lufthrausers.
00:22:57 That's basically all you need to say.
00:22:59 I'm sorry, man.
00:23:00 I'm sorry, Dev, but you know it's true.
00:23:02 I'm not crazy here.
00:23:04 You just made Lufthrausers again,
00:23:06 and you did a competent job.
00:23:08 Sorry.
00:23:09 I was annoyed, because I looked at you
00:23:11 and Digi in the chat
00:23:13 talking about this game,
00:23:14 arguing about its merits,
00:23:15 and they're just discussing the merits
00:23:17 of Lufthrausers.
00:23:18 This game doesn't really merit discussion of its own.
00:23:21 He immediately said it's like Lufthrausers.
00:23:23 Well, okay.
00:23:24 Fair enough.
00:23:25 Fair enough.
00:23:26 I don't know if he said it is Lufthrausers,
00:23:28 but that is like Lufthrausers.
00:23:29 Okay, but you and Digi,
00:23:30 without actually having played Lufthrausers,
00:23:32 you can't appreciate the true depth
00:23:34 of just how much simply Lufthrausers it is.
00:23:39 Well, that just means
00:23:40 he's one of a very exclusive group of people.
00:23:43 There's only three people in this world
00:23:45 who've made Lufthrausers,
00:23:46 and it's the two people of Lambeer and him.
00:23:48 So that puts him in a pretty special position.
00:23:50 I guess you got a point there.
00:23:51 So from that position,
00:23:52 he can just rip off every game in the world
00:23:54 and eventually do whatever he wants with his unlimited power.
00:23:57 Yes.
00:23:58 Sure.
00:23:59 Sure.
00:24:00 All right.
00:24:01 You got anything else to say about Nemesis?
00:24:03 Oh, yeah.
00:24:04 I forgot that's what it was called.
00:24:05 I mean, yeah.
00:24:06 Well, just kidding.
00:24:07 Well, I don't know.
00:24:08 I mean, the title's right up there.
00:24:09 Lufthrausers 2 Electric Boogaloo.
00:24:11 Yeah, Lufthrausers 2 Return of Jafar.
00:24:13 Return of Jafar.
00:24:15 All right.
00:24:16 I guess that's it.
00:24:17 Yeah, that's it.
00:24:18 That's it for the first episode of PCP Destructive Criticism.
00:24:20 Yeah.
00:24:21 We're going to be, we'll be back.
00:24:23 Just anyone who's a PCP viewer, make something,
00:24:25 and then maybe we'll criticism it.
00:24:28 Make something a little good.
00:24:29 Don't be a piece of shit.
00:24:30 I mean, this is good.
00:24:32 This is fine.
00:24:33 This is the level.
00:24:35 This is a good baseline to shoot for,
00:24:37 to share your work with us
00:24:38 and have us give a fuck about it.
00:24:39 Yeah, indeed.
00:24:40 So good luck, everybody.
00:24:42 All right.
00:24:43 See ya.
