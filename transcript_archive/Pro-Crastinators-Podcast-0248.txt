00:00:00 What's Happening Gamers? Welcome back to another exciting episode of the PZP. I'm your host,
00:00:09 Cheesy Manfredo, and always with here is my lovely co-host, Tectonic Improv.
00:00:14 I've always been here. Yes, we've always been here. Every episode. And you know who we love.
00:00:21 That's the slogan. That's the slogan. That's the slogan.
00:00:24 Wait, who's that? Oh, is that? The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We've always been
00:00:27 here. Is that our guest? Is that our guest? Ben Saint, the infamous Twitter man, Ben Saint.
00:00:35 Hey, you gotta say Ben Saint, what are you doing on my review? Ben Saint, what are you
00:00:43 doing in my review of Green Ninja? I just thought I heard you were talking about
00:00:49 the Adventure Cats movie, and I thought we could have a little, I already did a review
00:00:56 about this, and you're not allowed to do it anymore.
00:00:59 Give and take, what are you doing in my podcast? Is that Dark Cheesy Manfredo? What are you
00:01:05 doing here? I thought I killed you in the last review of the Three Ninjas.
00:01:10 No, that was the Three Ninjas kickback review. Oh, man. Oh, no, it looks like I gotta do
00:01:22 it again. Cut to a video of me punching myself in front of a green screen. Except the other
00:01:29 you has a mime. Oh, he's a pasta clown, but his colors are inverted.
00:01:38 Yeah, it's like that episode of Powerpuff Girls where the clown turns into the mime,
00:01:43 and it was really scary for me as a kid for some reason, and it has that cool song at
00:01:47 the end. That's a pretty rad song. Not to flex. Oh, yeah, go ahead. There she is. I'm
00:01:56 so privileged to be a part of the PCP at last. I've been wanting to get on this show for
00:02:01 years, so I think I'm so blessed. Give and take, what are you doing in my review? You
00:02:06 just like squeaked. I tried to do it a bit, but then the bit of reviewer took over and
00:02:13 I was like, okay, I gotta do it later. Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, and it's always yes. She
00:02:18 dropped for a second. I was like, oh, that's just perfect. Just perfect. Drops immediately
00:02:25 as the podcast starts. Is this the longest intro? No. Every podcast is entirely intro.
00:02:33 There's no content. Yeah, intro and then straight to voicemail. Yeah, so I'm thinking voicemails.
00:02:42 I'm thinking let's head to voicemails. We're done. Let's head up to voicemails. Alright,
00:02:48 first voicemail is for me, and it's this next thing I say in the entire show. It's
00:02:54 everything I say in the show is a voicemail that is just responding like it's pre-recorded
00:02:59 and it's responding to everybody as they say things. I'm not even live right now. It's
00:03:05 already started. Kind of the game. Remember when Martin Luther King delivered his historic
00:03:11 I Have a Dream voicemail? That was a great podcast. I think I've already made that joke.
00:03:17 I wish the CIA didn't cut his voicemail offshore. The CIA said this is cringe. The CIA, you
00:03:29 know, the enemy podcast of the PCP. There's a flock of geese flying by my window. I don't
00:03:39 know if you can hear that. Dude, open the window. Let them in. Yeah, see if they want to join
00:03:44 the podcast. Grab them by the neck and then you can eat that. Special guest, a flock of
00:03:51 geese. Dude, we're really scraping the bottle of the barrel. Today we have some geese as
00:03:57 the guest. I know people would love it. It's been years since some geese made a video.
00:04:02 They're basically dead. That is true. They never finished their review of Synecdoche,
00:04:08 New York. I want to hear the rest. Is the movie good or not? I can't tell. I couldn't
00:04:17 watch it, but I don't want to do that. I'd rather wait seven fucking years to hear the
00:04:23 last of the review come out. I stopped an hour in because that's as far as the geese
00:04:29 got with their analysis. And I really want to watch more, but I'd love to watch the
00:04:35 movie, but I'd hate to be spoiled on the analysis. Yeah, exactly. What if I come up
00:04:40 with an analysis that's just greased with their analysis? I don't want to do that. Yeah,
00:04:44 that would be so cringe. You get canceled. I want to be geese. Implying I had a different
00:04:50 opinion. I don't want that. Bad news. Bad news. It would be very unpogged. Speaking of reviewers.
00:05:00 Are you going to review something live? Yeah, I'm going to review this dick. You guys want
00:05:10 to know how the instant win to get a popular tweet on Twitter. The instant life. I know
00:05:18 what it is. Tell us. In case for the audience, just shit on Doug Walker, the nostalgia critic,
00:05:25 and then just everyone agrees with you. They'll instantly retweet it. And if you do it enough
00:05:30 times, eventually some psycho is going to impersonate you and send Gorda people. It's pretty great.
00:05:35 Now, cheesy, I have a question. How do we know that the imposter isn't on this podcast with
00:05:43 us right now? Oh, no. An among us reference. This really is a review. Do they guess that
00:05:52 would be there? It is a little sus. Ask me something only cheesy would know. What is the,
00:06:02 do you like big breasts? Yes. Okay. What's the ending of the villain verse? What's villain
00:06:08 verse about? It's how great capitalism is. Oh, wait, no, I mean, no, it's, oh, no. We got
00:06:15 them. We got them. What is Monkey Jones favorite webcomic? Is that true? It's true. It's true.
00:06:30 It's true. What's his favorite? What's his favorite webcomic? The vapor. I mean, fuck, wait,
00:06:34 no, never mind. You can watch one of these old videos and see the, oh, never mind. Anyway,
00:06:44 so, again, what are you going to say after I rudely interrupted you? Huh? What? What?
00:06:50 You're going to say something? No. You're going to. I had a joke, I think, but it's gone
00:06:56 now. It doesn't matter. Damn. We can pretend to laugh. Things expire. These things expire.
00:07:01 Yep. Yep. I want to know, I want to know how much GME does everyone own right now? I'm
00:07:11 like so stupid because I haven't bothered to look into how to get one yet. You are so
00:07:16 stupid. All you have to do is hold. All you had to do was hold. Hold the line. Just don't
00:07:21 press the sell button. Just don't press the sell button. Just buy the dip and hold. Goddammit.
00:07:27 All right. Can I do it right now? How do I do that? You would need an account on something.
00:07:36 I only have exactly one GME. A giant erect. No, you fucked up. GME. A giant massive erection.
00:07:45 Gem is my name. Pretend I said a giant massive erection first. Someone said that.
00:07:54 Eleazar, make my joke work. Eleazar, make a funny joke. Eleazar will make a laugh, I swear.
00:08:02 I'm also going to buy stock stock. It's not loading. It's not loading. I'm just going to
00:08:12 say I'm pretty sure that it's too late. It's too late if you're looking to buy a game stop.
00:08:21 You might as well just, you're done. You missed the boat. It's not too late. It's not too late.
00:08:28 You could probably make a Robin Hood account right now and probably buy at least one stock
00:08:34 on the market. Didn't Robin Hood be the evil compromise corporation pretending to be for the people?
00:08:44 Yes, Robin Hood is bad and they will restrict your stocks, but they are also the easiest
00:08:50 one to get to open an account on, which is why people use them. That's why it's taken
00:08:54 Spork like five days to open a Robin Hood account.
00:08:58 I was just going to mention Spork. It took her like five days.
00:09:02 Yeah, it's still approving mine. Mine has been being approved for like three days now, so yeah.
00:09:08 I think you should just lie to them and tell them that you're an expert investor.
00:09:12 I've been on Wall Street. I like some Twitter memes.
00:09:17 Yeah, because when I made an account they were like, what was your level of investing
00:09:21 experience and I was like, hello, and I haven't been approved. I think maybe that's it.
00:09:25 Maybe I just had to lie to them and say, yeah, I'm a fucking pro. I do this every day. This is my job
00:09:29 and I am a hedge fund owner. I would never attempt.
00:09:32 Yeah, you fake it so you make it. You wear a suit and then you say, yeah, I'm good.
00:09:37 And then you get in. That's how it works.
00:09:39 Yeah, RFCK is a hedge fund.
00:09:42 Welcome aboard, sir.
00:09:46 Yeah, I run the RFCK hedge fund.
00:09:49 I do. I have a hundred and I have a hundred slime coins sitting right here looking at me.
00:09:54 What's worth more than all the GME in the world?
00:09:57 Oh, please, Mr. Wall Street, please take my slime coins, please.
00:10:01 Please, oh, please, take my slime coins.
00:10:05 Just like GME, the thing about slime coin is you buy the dip and then you hold.
00:10:09 You hold, hold, hold forever. You never sell. That's how you get rich.
00:10:15 My my GME is my GME is sitting comfortably around 300, 300 and change.
00:10:23 And this this week, this week, Melvin Capital is going to have to liquidate.
00:10:28 They're going to have to start liquidating Melvin Capital.
00:10:31 It's going to be fucking epic.
00:10:34 Just like just like still quite high.
00:10:37 I'm looking at the GME.
00:10:39 It's it's yeah, it's pretty high still. It dipped down.
00:10:42 It's going. It's got one of the dips.
00:10:44 It's only going up. It's only going up. Melvin has not liquidated.
00:10:48 What a Melvin.
00:10:49 I'm really happy to see to see all of these big hedge funds losing their marbles over over people doing what they're allowed to do.
00:10:58 There probably won't be huge ramifications for this that end up being good for us.
00:11:04 But in the meantime, the memes are very, very, very, very funny.
00:11:08 I mean, I think I think a few like like few.
00:11:13 I don't know what to call them companies or trusts or whatever.
00:11:17 Somebody's gone bankrupt already.
00:11:19 That's that's Pog. That's pretty cool.
00:11:22 That is pretty Pog.
00:11:24 I mean, they will they will if if it continues, which shows every sign of continuing.
00:11:30 Like shorting the market was the thing like they buy a bunch of stock so that they can make profit off of it later.
00:11:36 But if the stock goes up, they now can't sell it for profit.
00:11:41 And so they've basically wasted so much money and they're trying to trying to wait for the people to stop making the stock rise for people to stop buying and stop holding.
00:11:53 Yeah.
00:11:54 So they can't because it's costing them money in the meantime.
00:11:57 Yeah, it's costing them money every every second they hold on to it.
00:12:00 I think there's I don't know if it's interest exactly, but that something something.
00:12:06 It becomes more expensive the longer they hold on to it to sell it later.
00:12:11 And since the people the longer this goes on, the more damage it will do to these wealthy people who are used to fucking with the economy to make small relatively for them small profits by destroying parts of the economy for fun for gambling.
00:12:29 I think I'm a I'm a little optimistic about this because like, yeah, like some fucking Wall Street douchebags are going on CNN and and being like these these small investors are just trying to fuck over billionaires, you know.
00:12:45 Yeah, exactly.
00:12:46 Nobody nobody nobody likes them.
00:12:48 Everyone hates them.
00:12:49 Like, you know, we fucking Ted Cruz and AOC are both like fuck these guys on Twitter.
00:12:55 I don't think I think I think we're going to win.
00:12:58 Like, I don't think it is like acceptable socially to like, like, I know some people like like a Warren, like Elizabeth Warren was like, this is kind of economic chaos.
00:13:11 We have to regulate this.
00:13:12 But everyone hates Warren.
00:13:13 I think it's going to I don't I think it's going to be good.
00:13:18 I don't think there's they're going to like scramble to like legislate like a little like individuals can't bet on on the on the stocks anymore.
00:13:25 I mean, if they do that go to business, it'll be like even more obvious how fucked the the average Joe is compared to the billion.
00:13:34 That will be the turning point.
00:13:36 I think that I think the ethics of the ethics of the situation are transparent or they're obvious enough that I I don't think they can afford.
00:13:46 I don't think anyone's willing to stick stick their neck out and be like, no, I'm going to defend the hedge funds.
00:13:51 I think I think we got it.
00:13:54 I think we won this one.
00:13:55 I can't wait till President Biden rolls out the new regulations where you're not allowed to bet on stock unless you own land.
00:14:03 Oh, God.
00:14:05 That's how they get them.
00:14:07 But based well based by does it again.
00:14:10 Sleepy Joe.
00:14:11 He did it again.
00:14:12 No.
00:14:13 Sleepy Joe.
00:14:15 Sleeping on my fucking Stimmy.
00:14:17 True.
00:14:18 Sleeping on my Stimmy.
00:14:19 Sleeping on my my shrink in my Stimmy.
00:14:22 What are you talking about, Ben?
00:14:24 Every day.
00:14:25 Can't.
00:14:26 Can't wait for my fourteen hundred dollars.
00:14:28 He always said we were going to get eight hundred dollars.
00:14:32 The always we've always been at war with Oceania.
00:14:35 Eight hundred dollars.
00:14:36 Why would he want six hundred dollars?
00:14:38 You caught on millennials always wanting six hundred dollars from the government.
00:14:41 You should be happy that you're getting two dollars.
00:14:45 Just two.
00:14:46 Not two hundred.
00:14:48 Two dollars.
00:14:49 You know what?
00:14:50 Die.
00:14:51 Just die.
00:14:52 Six hundred cents.
00:14:54 Fourteen hundred dollars delivered in fourteen dollar installments like per annum.
00:15:00 Also you have to pay interest on the money that you already got.
00:15:04 So it gets less and less each time.
00:15:07 It reverse compounding interest is very complicated.
00:15:10 Don't worry about it.
00:15:11 We did the math for you.
00:15:14 Well, we just don't want these people spending their money on frivolous things like GameStop.
00:15:21 Yeah.
00:15:22 No.
00:15:23 That would be unethical.
00:15:26 It would just be unethical if regular Americans were given money to invest in stock.
00:15:32 Because then hedge funders would go out of business.
00:15:35 I've just learned something so incredible.
00:15:38 GameStop was founded in 1984.
00:15:41 Dude, this is literally 1984 right now.
00:15:44 Holy shit.
00:15:45 This is it.
00:15:46 This is it.
00:15:47 This is it.
00:15:48 Was it actually?
00:15:49 Yes, actually.
00:15:50 Whoa.
00:15:51 Whoa.
00:15:52 Biden was born in 1984.
00:15:53 Whoa.
00:15:54 What the fuck?
00:15:55 GameStop founded 1984.
00:15:56 That was Texas.
00:15:59 Now, I'm pretty sure Ben is the only one who's ever lived on the East Coast and I don't
00:16:04 know how big this chain was, but before GameStop, I remember that there was a store called FunkoLand.
00:16:11 FunkoLand?
00:16:12 Yeah.
00:16:13 Yeah, GameStop.
00:16:14 There was FunkoLand.
00:16:16 I think it became EB Games.
00:16:20 Something like that.
00:16:21 I think GameStop bought them.
00:16:23 We had EB Games over here on the West Coast.
00:16:26 I think FunkoLand became EB Games and then GameStop bought EB Games.
00:16:31 Yeah, that sounds about right.
00:16:33 Yeah.
00:16:34 I think West Coast had like Game Crazy or something.
00:16:37 Yeah, there was a couple of, ooh, yeah.
00:16:39 I remember a handful of Game Crazies.
00:16:41 Never heard of that.
00:16:42 But I've never really, even as a kid, I never liked GameStop because I liked FunkoLand and
00:16:51 where the FunkoLand was where I lived turned into a GameStop and I was like, well, when's
00:16:55 FunkoLand coming back?
00:16:56 Turns out, never.
00:16:57 It's never coming back.
00:16:59 Damn.
00:17:00 I mean, they were all pretty interchangeable, I guess.
00:17:03 They were all stores that had video games.
00:17:05 I don't know why.
00:17:06 Yeah.
00:17:07 I care because I was a dumb kid, so.
00:17:09 But Tec, good new bad.
00:17:11 But Tec, FunkoLand did come back with the amount of FunkoPops they sell at GameStop now.
00:17:17 Might as well call it FunkoLand.
00:17:19 That's true.
00:17:20 Although, it was spelled fun C-O, not fun K-O.
00:17:23 C-O-O.
00:17:24 I guess you gotta appeal to millennials by spelling things wrong.
00:17:27 Don't correct my English.
00:17:29 I do not respect his language.
00:17:32 No one does.
00:17:34 Okay, my GameStop story is that when I traded in my NES to, I think, get some extra money
00:17:42 to buy, I think a PlayStation 2 maybe?
00:17:46 I traded in my NES and they paid me absolute dog shit.
00:17:51 Yes.
00:17:52 And they gave me $8 for an original copy of Kid Icarus, which is a kind of rare cartridge.
00:18:00 Yeah, that's a pretty crazy game, especially now.
00:18:03 I think it's probably around $40, $50 or something for Kid Icarus.
00:18:08 Damn, you know how much you do it?
00:18:09 That sounds...
00:18:10 I mean, it's not an impossible to find thing, but it's not a super common cartridge.
00:18:14 And they paid me...
00:18:15 I think they paid me like cents.
00:18:17 They paid me like cents for my other cartridges and they gave me $8.
00:18:21 I think I probably made like $30 or $40 trading in my whole NES collection and the console.
00:18:27 And it was good and it was in working condition.
00:18:30 I shouldn't have done it.
00:18:31 What a fucking mistake.
00:18:32 Yeah, I think everyone has a story like that.
00:18:35 You know how much doge coins you get with an original Kid Icarus?
00:18:39 How much is a doge coin?
00:18:41 It's like a cent now or something?
00:18:43 No, it's at about 2.5, I think.
00:18:49 I got a complaint about this.
00:18:52 When doge coin was blowing up, when doge coin was blowing up, it was around like 3 or 4
00:18:57 and I was like, fuck it, it's going to the moon, I'm buying in.
00:19:00 Tom was buying and I was sold.
00:19:02 So I went and I just tried to find out how to do it and I couldn't do it.
00:19:06 I couldn't get any wallets to install.
00:19:09 You know, I couldn't get an account approved in time on...
00:19:14 Oh god, wait, it's going to the moon again.
00:19:17 It's going to the moon again.
00:19:18 Is it up to 4?
00:19:19 Oh my god.
00:19:20 It's up to 4 cents.
00:19:22 It's up to 4 cents.
00:19:23 Holy shit.
00:19:24 This is just today.
00:19:26 This is just today.
00:19:27 I gotta say, I'm shocked doge coin didn't explode when the doge meme came back.
00:19:35 I assumed that doge coin would have exploded in price when that dog started being funny again.
00:19:43 But I guess it turns out all you really needed to do was have the entire internet start paying attention to stocks and hedge funds.
00:19:53 And then doge coin will be worth 2 cents.
00:19:56 People are talking about investing and then people don't know what it means and they're like,
00:20:02 hey, this is a funny meme about investing.
00:20:06 What's a meme thing you can invest in?
00:20:09 Hey, remember doge coin?
00:20:10 Let's do that.
00:20:11 And then they did.
00:20:12 Doge coin didn't have anything to do with shorting the hedge funds or anything.
00:20:17 It was just like, let's invest in something and doge coin is funny.
00:20:20 Yeah.
00:20:21 Well, high tide raises all ships.
00:20:26 Crypto and GameStop are just stocks.
00:20:29 They kind of just go hand in hand.
00:20:30 Chances are, if you're trading stocks, you know a thing or two about Bitcoin and its affiliates.
00:20:35 But anyway, as doge coin was passing around 4, I could not figure out how to invest.
00:20:41 And then it ended up rising up to like 8.
00:20:44 And I just watched it.
00:20:46 And I was just watching it like, well, I missed it.
00:20:49 I missed the rocket.
00:20:50 They made me watch.
00:20:51 They did it in front of me.
00:20:53 They made me watch.
00:20:54 It's all happening.
00:20:56 Are you going to be watching too much again, Ben?
00:21:00 Is this going to be the same as the Bitcoin?
00:21:04 Is this the new key?
00:21:06 Probably not that bad.
00:21:07 Probably not that bad because I was way over-invested in Bitcoin.
00:21:12 I had like a large fraction of my entire net value invested in Bitcoin for a minute there,
00:21:18 which is like a terrible, terrible idea.
00:21:21 I'm not as, I'm only have like a piece.
00:21:25 I'm considering everything that I've put into GME now to be gone.
00:21:32 Which is the right way to do it for this specific holding.
00:21:36 Like with a healthy mindset.
00:21:38 Yeah.
00:21:39 Investing in Bitcoin.
00:21:41 Why don't you invest in some bitches?
00:21:44 Well, with the way Bitcoin's going, maybe I won't have to.
00:21:49 Wait, how is Bitcoin doing?
00:21:52 Bitcoin is, okay.
00:21:54 Bitcoin had a shitty like little meme jump there because Elon put Bitcoin in his bio
00:21:59 and it like jumped up a bit.
00:22:01 That's all it takes.
00:22:02 Bitcoin had almost back to 40 but not quite and now it's back down to like 33.
00:22:06 So, fuck you Elon.
00:22:08 I honestly, after GME, after GME is dead, I am seriously considering like shorting Tesla
00:22:16 because like Tesla has seen like, Tesla is a shitty meme company that doesn't actually do anything.
00:22:23 You talking about that?
00:22:24 This fucking clown is in charge of it.
00:22:26 Who survives entirely off of like, you know, the fact that stupid red editors think that he's cool.
00:22:31 His stock is predicted not to do well and I just think it would be fun to profit off of Elon Musk's loss.
00:22:38 So, I'm probably going to do that.
00:22:40 I don't care much for Elon Musk at all but isn't Tesla the car manufacturing thing okay?
00:22:47 Yes.
00:22:48 Tesla's seen among other things.
00:22:50 I mean, with regards to having like bunches of powering stations and stuff.
00:22:56 I know the cars are like premium like expensive annoying things but like, electric cars are pretty cool.
00:23:03 I guess electric cars have already existed for a while.
00:23:09 My thoughts about that, okay but Tesla's are only for rich people right?
00:23:14 Basically.
00:23:15 They're not like, yeah so fuck them.
00:23:17 That's not a solution.
00:23:18 I think the idea is that eventually they will become the standard but you know, you got to start somewhere.
00:23:23 Electric cars are kind of iffy.
00:23:25 Because you could kind of like, I heard that you could make the argument if there was better public transportation.
00:23:31 There wouldn't really be a need for electric cars.
00:23:33 I mean, if you move everything towards electric cars, you're going to have to get rid of all the old cars.
00:23:37 Which is like even more waste, you know.
00:23:39 I'm absolutely on the like build more trains.
00:23:43 Oh god.
00:23:44 Yeah, fuck Tesla.
00:23:45 Fuck Tesla, fuck Elon and the hyperloop.
00:23:47 Whatever the fuck that is.
00:23:48 The hyperloop is completely stupid.
00:23:50 Yeah.
00:23:51 I hate this whole fucking myth perpetrated by Elon about like, oh yeah, I slept in my fucking car when I invested in PayPal.
00:24:00 You know, because I was betting on it.
00:24:02 I thought like bro, no you didn't.
00:24:03 He did not sleep in no fucking car.
00:24:05 No you fucking didn't.
00:24:06 You fucking liar.
00:24:07 You know, he walked around, he literally walked around with emeralds in his pockets for game college.
00:24:11 Thanks dad.
00:24:13 That's a quote.
00:24:14 Yeah, yeah.
00:24:15 Yeah, emeralds.
00:24:16 Because he inherited fortune from an apartheid.
00:24:19 Whenever he's like struggling on a test, he just, he just poems the chaos emeralds in his pocket and he's like, let's go.
00:24:26 And then Live and Learn starts playing as his hair goes super and then he gets a 74.
00:24:34 Yeah, he eats.
00:24:35 That's what happens.
00:24:36 This is why Bitcoin exploded.
00:24:37 This is why Bitcoin happened because he fucking chaos controlled the price of it.
00:24:41 It's very vague in the games.
00:24:43 I guess it can raise cryptocurrency.
00:24:50 That's what the chaos, chaos control literally just lets you like make your god mode wishes into reality, right?
00:24:56 Like, isn't that what they're said to do?
00:24:58 It just like stops time or like lets you teleport.
00:25:02 It's really vague and weird.
00:25:05 It just is.
00:25:06 That's what it does.
00:25:07 I thought it does be cool.
00:25:09 I thought that their canonical power was that like chaos control just lets you like make your, basically make your wishes come true.
00:25:18 And just, I guess that implies that Sonic's wish is to be yellow and be really fast.
00:25:23 He saw Dragon Ball Z and he thought that's really fucking rad.
00:25:26 I think I'll do that.
00:25:27 Yeah.
00:25:28 Yo, that's way past cool.
00:25:30 In my fan fiction, they use chaos control to like abort like the anti-Christ.
00:25:38 I'm gonna have to stop you right there.
00:25:40 Okay.
00:25:41 Okay.
00:25:42 Gotcha.
00:25:43 Yes.
00:25:44 Then what happens?
00:25:45 Then after that, Sonic's like, well, we gotta go save Popeye so they go back in time.
00:25:50 But Popeye's has already been corrupted by Megatron's mind control.
00:25:55 Popeye the character of Popeye the rest of them.
00:25:58 Popeye the savior, yeah.
00:25:59 He's very crucial.
00:26:00 You see, he has like the genetic sequence to activate the Eva, which is going to be important in like arc five.
00:26:07 But I don't want to tell you too much about that.
00:26:09 Yeah, sure.
00:26:10 Oh, naturally.
00:26:11 Dude, I'd love to see Popeye beat the shit out of Shinji.
00:26:15 Dude, you're getting in that robot.
00:26:18 Good, good, good, good, good, good.
00:26:19 I think Popeye should just be relevant again in general.
00:26:24 I guess he's just getting out of the Eva and just trying to beat the age of the fist.
00:26:31 Yeah, he'd take a bunch of spinach and like, no, he'd get like a shipment container filled with spinach.
00:26:40 And while piloting the Eva, he would eat that container and all the spinach would go in and it wouldn't work.
00:26:48 And he would be like, what's going on?
00:26:50 And then he would just do it himself.
00:26:52 Shinji, Shinji, Shinji watching Popeye on a stretcher covered in bandages like every time you won't pilot the Eva.
00:26:59 Popeye has to do it again.
00:27:01 Popeye has to pilot the Eva.
00:27:06 Oh, you ever seen those, there's like a, there was a clip flowing around where like Popeye's like in a fight.
00:27:12 It's from one of the old cartoons.
00:27:13 And even when he's getting his ass kicked, he's still like talking shit.
00:27:18 I imagine like the Eva has a pen.
00:27:22 I've watched some of the old Popeye's and he really just sort of mumbles like,
00:27:27 he's really like mumbly and like talking, like there's no lip syncing sometimes.
00:27:34 It's just sort of like the voice actor is just saying all of these things and there's sort of accent and then there's punch sound effects.
00:27:40 I really actually love Popeye.
00:27:43 The voice direction was just a go fucking ape shit. Just say whatever the fuck you want. We'll figure it out later
00:27:50 Popeye is insane, dude. We haven't really like
00:27:54 solidified the Popeye characters. Let's do whatever the fuck you want
00:27:58 Animation used to be good and then they invented anime. Popeye is Fleischer right? Yeah, down hill
00:28:05 Did you say Popeye is his red build?
00:28:07 Well, yes, but a spinach build really. He's a Fleischer cartoon, right? Like Betty Boop and stuff
00:28:14 Yes, well, I don't know. I don't know names, but he's from that era. Yeah
00:28:21 He started in that era. I'm sure I want Popeyes to show up in one piece
00:28:26 I think it would make sense. Would he be a long-armed tribe?
00:28:30 Remember, that's the only... Franky is already kind of Popeye. He would just be like a regular human who's just that strong like a garb
00:28:39 Yeah, that makes sense. He just has weird arms, but he's not a long-armed tribe. Yeah, some of these motherfuckers just have weird things
00:28:46 He's the thick-armed tribe
00:28:48 It's a new one. Yeah, I like that. I could imagine it in my head
00:28:52 Like that they were outside like a like a like a sailor bar and then Luffy is fucking
00:28:57 Crash through the wall because he got thrown out and then and then like smoke is coming out of the the bar
00:29:03 The giant hole that Luffy just made and we see the silhouette of Popeyes, and he's all like your garb's kid, aren't you?
00:29:11 He's a marine
00:29:14 What if he had like a like a piston double fruit which turns is like his his fists into like pistons like big O
00:29:22 Yeah
00:29:24 That'd be cool. Oh my god. Yeah, Oda, get on that. Can we get Popeye in here?
00:29:29 Please definitely like Popeye. I feel like there's no way he would have been inspired by him for sure
00:29:36 There should be a crossover movie. I could see them doing that. I like that Lupin movie they made last year
00:29:41 Luffy versus Popeye. Yeah, Popeye. Are we talking about Luffy? Whoever wins, we lose
00:29:51 Please stop defending pedophiles for one second. I mean Popeye would be a marine, right?
00:29:57 Yeah, no way. He's he definitely be like a
00:30:00 Not not an admiral, but he'd be like a what's Garth's vice admiral vice admiral. Yeah, he definitely be a vice admiral
00:30:07 True. It's cheesy. I'm surprised there isn't already a Popeye
00:30:11 I mean some some characters have big Popeye arms though. True. Yeah. Yeah
00:30:16 This the set the setting was mostly inspired by Popeye. I'm sure
00:30:21 Cheesy. What were you saying about defending pedophiles?
00:30:26 Is that like an actual news thing or?
00:30:30 It might have been like a year or two ago, but um, it was like it was a couple of things
00:30:35 First it was like, you know, you know, the you know the man get the anime at orico
00:30:42 Is that the cook the cooking one? Yes, like, uh, yeah
00:30:47 Yeah, so that guy turned out to be a pedo
00:30:49 And
00:30:53 Cuz they were friends and then the Roni Kenshin guy turned out to be a pedo and
00:30:58 Oh, they're not just out of but like all of shown in Jeff defended that guy and it was like very like
00:31:03 Man, I know I don't things are different in Japan, but it's an incredibly bad optics. Yeah, it's not it's not the same country
00:31:12 That's for sure. I did it. I I think the Roni Kenshin guy had like
00:31:18 Way more like they couldn't even collect all the child point he had cuz he had just so much of it. Yeah
00:31:24 Geez Louise
00:31:27 Like like terabytes like the real
00:31:30 I
00:31:31 Think it was like I think it was 2.75 terabytes. We can actually go hang on. Let's be a little more specific here. Uh,
00:31:40 Yes
00:31:42 Well, that sucks
00:31:44 I got a parrot everything yo-ho-ho
00:31:50 You know, you know when you hear like something like Tezuka may have said something racist in the past
00:31:56 You're like, okay. Um, that was that was in the past
00:31:59 But it was cool back in the past and it's like everyone was a bit more racist than they are today back then
00:32:04 But you can't it doesn't matter how far back you go or how old you are pedophilia is like terrible
00:32:10 It's always been well, unless you go like to the middle ages or something
00:32:14 I mean, you say you say that and yet like people were fucking marrying 13 year olds like all over the fucking place
00:32:21 So it's not like people were when I pedophilia. She was mature for her age. I swear
00:32:30 I know that I did that I didn't mean like all over the like throughout time. I mean like
00:32:36 People that you could even feasibly know of like ancient historical figures. It's like
00:32:43 Whatever like we we know the world was fucked in many ways back then
00:32:47 It's hard to like judge them by today's standards, but people who are like, I don't know maybe 50 60 years
00:32:55 You know
00:32:57 black and black and white
00:32:58 photograph people
00:33:01 Show me the show me the
00:33:03 Show me the commandments that says thou shalt not sleep with children. Come on
00:33:08 Yeah, I'm drawn up blank here. Well, good thing. I'm not a christian. Otherwise, who knows what I'm thinking with you. Yeah, it's like
00:33:16 Yeah, it's incredibly sucks. Um
00:33:20 I don't think like
00:33:21 didn't Tezuka like beat his wife. Wasn't that the big thing?
00:33:25 I I remember just hearing about like
00:33:28 I was it kimba and some other things where he's like drawn blackface and
00:33:34 a lot of weird
00:33:36 bit of like, um, you know
00:33:39 Not not
00:33:40 Yeah, racist. I think he apologized for those depictions and kimba like years later
00:33:46 But yeah, well, you know, he still did it
00:33:48 they um
00:33:49 They still continue like even up until like the 90s. They were doing things they were drawing a lot of like
00:33:55 You look at like early dragon ball
00:33:57 You still find like little traces of people. Yeah, I mean, I mean there's like mr. Black from the red ribbon army
00:34:03 Who they yeah like a samba character. They they just they didn't have as much of a
00:34:09 understanding because there's so few black people even in that part of the world
00:34:15 Much less in japan itself
00:34:17 So they would like they were sort of divorced from the idea of of like race problems
00:34:23 Like of like what what are the what is the black people in the audience going to feel about this?
00:34:29 You know, like they won't because like none of them are reading that. Um, yeah hot take
00:34:33 They just they aren't here. Take uh japan
00:34:36 Probably ain't that good
00:34:38 Probably ain't that good in place. I'll say bro. Take there you go. Yeah, you know a hot take. We need another nuke
00:34:43 Bro, no, bro. No, they made nintendo games over there
00:34:48 There's gotta be another wife
00:34:50 But we'll give them we'll give them like one more nintendo direct and then
00:34:55 That's that's the squeeze. There's never gonna be another nintendo direct
00:35:00 The duke didn't fucking do anything
00:35:04 The dude two nukes didn't fucking work. No, no, no, it's good because they made godzilla and that's cool
00:35:10 Okay, you know what never mind japan good actually japan great place best place in the world can't beat it. Um
00:35:17 What's that one shit that white national's love to say homo erectus
00:35:21 After those days, it's basically an afternoose day 10 out of 10. We love it. Wait
00:35:26 Well, the thing that the thing that white nation's like to say homo love
00:35:30 They love homosexuals
00:35:33 That they're white national is the love white people so much. They'll fuck any white person amander the gender
00:35:38 Um, just like just like trump said, uh those years after he got the covet
00:35:44 Oh, you know the last guy the last of us who?
00:35:49 Um pre-biden
00:35:52 Oh post post obama pre-biden
00:35:55 Uh, you mean the dark. Oh, yeah, there was like this guy. Um
00:36:00 I like to call him dark obama
00:36:03 You remember dark obama
00:36:06 He was he was that orange. He was the orange
00:36:10 In was in japanese languages. He's known as black obama. They had to change it in the western audiences
00:36:17 It was that was such a weirdest chapter in baki the grappler. I don't even know why
00:36:22 There's like a five page summary of baki monogatari about that. It's really strange. It's just like I didn't see that
00:36:29 I didn't watch that digi video
00:36:36 This is this is the most sus pcp episode in a long time
00:36:41 I cannot wait to see pcp episode. I cannot wait to see the pcp guy doing the sus face. It's gonna be so good
00:36:50 Oh my god, there's a sus face. Yeah, you know like the germa one. You not know about the sus face
00:36:56 Where he looks like um, he looks like apex twin on that one album cover that I was just about to say apex
00:37:05 Oh god what back in my day sus was just sauce. It was youtube poop and it was funny
00:37:13 What could you do I could suck he could suck
00:37:19 Yep, there he is unedited. Yeah
00:37:23 Oh my god, there was this fucking germa video I watched real face
00:37:26 I watched the other day of like his the thing stream and someone like he made like this
00:37:31 This wacky face and then someone in the chat posted a slightly edited version of that face
00:37:37 And he had a nervous like borderline nervous breakdown over whether or not it was real. It was super fucking funny. Oh my god
00:37:46 Oh that that happened so often
00:37:49 He's he was always looking at his like. Oh god. I'm so fucked up
00:37:54 In in he has like a stream like awards of like
00:37:58 The viewers vote on like at the end of the year on like a bunch of things related to germa streams
00:38:04 Like best joke worst joke
00:38:07 um
00:38:08 And then there's like things like worst noise where germa just does a plays a game and he's like
00:38:13 And he's like that's one of the candidates for worst noise of the year
00:38:17 and
00:38:18 It's it's it's really funny. He has things like
00:38:21 like
00:38:23 Like this like like people
00:38:25 there's a there's like a
00:38:27 What do you call it a not a community like a culture of people taking
00:38:31 Images from germa when he's got face cam on and then fucking with them and then sending them to him and he puts them on screen
00:38:37 And he's and he's like crying. It's like no
00:38:41 Crying or laughing like it's just it's just really funny and it's just like a fun back and forth
00:38:46 And sometimes it results in actually scary images like this
00:38:50 German is such like a he's a genuinely great showman. He's probably like
00:38:55 Like the best one of the best
00:38:58 Uh, I yeah, I would I would create is
00:39:01 like
00:39:02 Entertainers online
00:39:04 I'd say
00:39:05 He he's a good. He's a great. Um, yeah showman is is the right word
00:39:10 It's not fair to just say he plays video games on stream. He's yeah
00:39:15 Like you don't you don't do a live action twitch integrated carnival and not be carnival
00:39:21 Oh, yeah, did you have you not heard of that that there was I don't know
00:39:25 I I only I literally only know of germa at all like from you Gibb for the most part
00:39:31 Well, there was this one stream pre-covid. So 2019 2018. Yeah, a few years ago now and he had
00:39:41 Put funds together and he made a stream live stream
00:39:44 With a bunch of people who made robots that can be activated by twitch
00:39:50 Like integrated like button prompts like everybody says up left right and the robot will move
00:39:56 And with this concept like twitch plays with this concept
00:40:00 He was like like twitch plays pokemon kind of yeah, twitch plays pokemon
00:40:03 But twitch plays a physical robot with like a throwing hand or like a something and he creates
00:40:09 He made a carnival in a field
00:40:12 Where like chat plays like toss the ring or like throw the ball
00:40:18 And he does he did
00:40:20 My favorite one. I think was the dunk tank where he's sitting in a dunk tank
00:40:25 And chat has to try and shoot the ball at the target to get him in the water
00:40:30 And it's like it's that's is it a ball or was it a frog like a little
00:40:34 One of the carnival games was complicated. It's it was so complicated. It's like a whole team of people behind it
00:40:39 And sounds awesome. It's it's such a fun like
00:40:43 Stupid thing
00:40:44 And it's just great. I just like
00:40:48 No one else would even bother to do something like this. That's insane. I never I've never heard of such a thing
00:40:53 I think the cherry on top for this whole carnival thing is that like the day he did it. It was so windy and shitty out
00:41:00 It's like it's like the chef's kiss to it all. Yeah, germa has this
00:41:06 Uh this air about him when he's like
00:41:09 Performing where he he likes drawing attention to like things going wrong
00:41:14 and like
00:41:15 You know playing that up like he doesn't actually like it to be super clean. He likes it to be like
00:41:21 Hit him to be the butt of the joke if it looks like shit, then it's funny because he's like
00:41:27 Putting on a shit performance
00:41:28 But everyone loves it because he's trying so hard to make it like an interesting. Yeah, there's like a clear effort there
00:41:35 So like everyone knows he's putting in a lot a lot of effort and when it goes wrong
00:41:38 He you know, he draws attention to it and it's all
00:41:41 Everyone feels like they're part of like the experience and now that carnival is like the
00:41:47 In recent memory at least like the biggest one of the you know, the most germa 985 thing that has happened
00:41:55 Yeah, probably the best thing since the live action germa rumble. Oh, yeah
00:41:59 The live action germa rumble is like, you know the the uh the radcon roll rumble
00:42:05 I was gonna ask was that the inspiration? Yeah, germa germa had done
00:42:09 Royal rumbles with the same sort of wrestling makes shitty characters in his videos
00:42:13 He makes the rumble and like he commentates it like a an actual like a
00:42:19 WWE commentator
00:42:21 Yeah, and he's he's doing all this stuff and he does bits and then one day he made on his main channel
00:42:26 um a live action version of the rumble where a bunch of his friends
00:42:31 And him get into an actual wrestling ring and beat the shit out of each other
00:42:35 You know like a scripted sort of wrestling rumble thing
00:42:38 With like the shitty character people dress up as his stupid video game
00:42:42 joke characters
00:42:44 That was he has he has so like such dumb characters like like the egg
00:42:50 Is one it's just like a guy in all like white makeup
00:42:54 He's just an egg. He was just a dumb character from like one of his first ever videos and now he's just immortalized
00:43:01 Or like glue man glue man or like martin van pieren made of glue
00:43:08 And I think has this elaborate like basketball backstory. Oh, yeah, I forget where that comes from
00:43:15 I know it's on the wiki
00:43:18 It he just did like some like
00:43:21 NBA
00:43:22 like 2k video and
00:43:24 And made like this video like this basketball star called Gabe the glue man del glossy
00:43:30 And then like he fell into a vat of glue and became glue man. I don't know it's
00:43:35 There's there's it's so like stupid, but it but there's it's it's dumb, but it's also high effort
00:43:44 Yeah, it's perfect and like there's a lot a lot to learn
00:43:48 There's a lot to love a lot of lore here a lot to love. Yeah, exactly give
00:43:53 Uh, you obviously, you know germa
00:43:55 So you like watch the you watch you watch like a lot of like the tf2 like commentary stuff, right?
00:44:01 So you've seen star. Yes
00:44:04 Very have you seen the new video he did about I did basically
00:44:09 It was basically like hey guys. Sorry. I haven't uploaded in a while video, but it was actually like pretty sad
00:44:15 It was a bit sad star is a tf2
00:44:18 Tuber and he and germa did a lot of collaborative videos back in the day when both of them were tf tubers
00:44:25 um
00:44:26 And uh, and also like just playing games together in general and they were really like great comedy duo, but star
00:44:33 yeah, was
00:44:34 much more known for his like
00:44:37 Impressive tf2 ability and germa was more like a comedy goof and they sort of yeah
00:44:43 You know, they went there
00:44:45 Different ways and star when overwatch came out. He went to overwatch
00:44:49 He was yeah, he was all in he was thinking this was going to be the next big
00:44:53 Um competitive thing. He really wanted to try out that for that because he's always been like very
00:44:58 Like good at shooting games and he likes playing competitively
00:45:03 um, and his fan base that he'd grown
00:45:06 Uh, just wanted him to play tf2 forever and he just his recent video was him
00:45:11 like
00:45:13 like revealing how
00:45:16 Soul crushing it is to have a fan base that is extremely abusive towards him for not playing a specific game that he doesn't want to play anymore
00:45:24 and it was just him
00:45:25 kind of like raw
00:45:27 like like saying
00:45:29 i'm not gonna do it and
00:45:31 you
00:45:32 What this has caused like in my life as depression and and anxiety and feeling bad
00:45:38 He just went into everything that is that is like
00:45:42 I you know, you hear it the story a lot of times with youtubers being
00:45:46 Feeling trapped. Yeah by their audience and uh, yeah
00:45:50 That's a big one
00:45:52 Because star had not uploaded in a long time. He'd gone straight. He'd been on twitch doing
00:45:58 His own thing for like years now
00:46:02 And his his fans were like
00:46:05 Come back tf2. Just keep playing the same game. Just keep doing what I want
00:46:10 Reliving the the glory days from
00:46:13 I don't know when they were nostalgic
00:46:16 Show us more tricks like the the window and dust bowl
00:46:21 It yeah a lot like throughout the video pieces
00:46:27 This is this is me. This is me with krug smash when krug smash does uh when krug smash does uh a short for it
00:46:33 I say fuck you
00:46:35 More monster killer, please go back to build another big for it and and do a do a plot do a plot heavy for it
00:46:41 shithead
00:46:42 nah
00:46:43 It's pretty much when he plays them when he plays a d a door fortress mod
00:46:46 I say no base game only vanilla only tile sets. Fuck you ascii only shithead
00:46:52 This is me. That's I'm in so I get it. You know, I relate. Fuck that guy who won't play tf2
00:46:59 Yo, that's me when like ben say is making gummy worms. I'm like no no gummy worms
00:47:05 Give us the vapors the champions. I want the champions. Give me more biscapades. I need the vapor stop
00:47:12 No more gummy worms. I can't read gummy worms never make it for real. I'll never make another gummy again
00:47:17 I can't get the imo
00:47:18 I used to I used to have contempt for biscapades because ben was doing it while he was
00:47:23 Holding off on making vapors three and I wanted vapors three
00:47:27 Wow finally glad I finally got that off my chest
00:47:30 It feels good and then vapors three came out and you were like boy. He should have done
00:47:36 It's like oh jeez, man
00:47:42 Showed you, huh?
00:47:46 Grass is always greener. That's what I learned
00:47:52 I've been um
00:47:53 this uh, I uh
00:47:55 I stopped working on my normal stuff first because I wanted to do the uh
00:48:01 It took me a few days to edit the the the oolily a book reading. Is that the secret project? Uh, and then the
00:48:07 That is not the secret project. I was I was working on it. No
00:48:10 That was like a thing I decided to do kind of randomly and was like
00:48:13 I should just bang this out while I still have enthusiasm for the idea
00:48:17 I can uh
00:48:19 Relate to that. Yeah, and then um, and then um, uh
00:48:24 Oh, yeah, and then I like as soon like the day I published that the stock market shit started happening
00:48:30 And I've been occupied. I was occupied with that for the rest of the week
00:48:33 Curious, so this week it's back to the secret prod this week. It's back to the secret prod. Oh
00:48:39 The day. Yeah the day that uh, ben saint reads uh,
00:48:42 Legend of ten elemental masters game stop goes to the moon and dogecoin explodes. Hmm
00:48:53 Correlation does equal causation
00:48:55 Ben saint
00:48:57 Ben saint stein. Hey, wait, wait, hold on. Wait, wait a second there
00:49:03 Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Hmm secret project more like
00:49:08 Secret project secret cabal
00:49:10 That's the secret is the secret project is the secret project terrorizing some children to extract their adrena
00:49:15 Perhaps I don't know
00:49:17 Fucking laser your jewish laser to start forest fires in california
00:49:21 Jewish moon laser
00:49:23 Ben couldn't keep the weight off with kita. So he's going to try he's going to try adrena. So it takes it out of the kids
00:49:29 Yeah, he's got to take the kito out of the kids. Wait, is the jewish space laser
00:49:33 Was the jewish space laser on the moon or was it just like on a satellite in space?
00:49:37 Because I remember that the idea guys terrorized chris chan with a moon specifically a moon laser
00:49:43 Was going to destroy quick fill. So I uh, you know, I think it must be it has to be the same laser
00:49:49 Is it maybe it's the space colony? No different laser. I don't know what the idea guys came up with but recently
00:49:57 Uh, there was a story about a congresswoman insane lady q and on marjorie taylor marjorie marjorie
00:50:03 Yeah, that's what I was referring to yeah, um who who thinks that um the fires in california that bush the big fires that
00:50:10 Swept all over the place were started by big funded space lasers
00:50:15 um
00:50:17 Um, and she heavily implies that without actually saying like hmm
00:50:20 I mean, you know, it's it's interesting that it was like these jewish companies that just fun
00:50:25 Like it's all like really stupid
00:50:28 I mean, I've seen old footage of her like talking about how she just is a q-believer
00:50:33 Yeah, like so. Yeah, of course
00:50:36 Of course you would think that there's an i'm a q-believer
00:50:39 A cute q-believer more like a q-t am i right?
00:50:44 A q-t
00:50:47 Not if I go into fight that bitch, um
00:50:51 She's she's you know what you know what?
00:50:54 Ah, what would we do without uh, what would we do without uh, you know once you get to know her it would be undemocratic to not
00:51:00 It would be undemocratic to not have some q representation in our in our houses of congress. Yeah, motherfuckers still be q
00:51:08 Wasn't didn't the date pass where like they were gonna gun down the democrats
00:51:12 Dude, when when people say I don't think she's I don't think she is publicly pro q anymore
00:51:17 But she was for a long time like before like before she was elected when people like say a date that something bad is gonna happen
00:51:24 And they you know rally around that date as soon as the date passes they just say oh, well it'll happen eventually
00:51:31 Here's a new date like that. It's always how they think it's it's either
00:51:36 They either reinterpret the date or I mean in the case of q the answer is like
00:51:40 Oh, the thing didn't happen on the date that it like the the mass arrested and take place
00:51:45 They're supposed to shit that just means the jewish cabal and the deep state are even more powerful than they thought
00:51:50 They're even more of a threat and they were able to prevent it
00:51:53 Like it literally just strengthens their results. Yeah, just trust the plan and it's in the slogan
00:51:59 To never to never stop. Yeah
00:52:02 To never like you trust the plan until it doesn't happen and then fucking trust the plan until it doesn't work and then
00:52:09 Form a private militia and take matters into your own hands
00:52:12 It's so annoying because if imagine like whoever was behind the q posts
00:52:18 originally if they came out
00:52:21 In in the way that they release information and they said sorry guys q has been a fake joke this whole time
00:52:27 It's not actually real. I I've been lying to you nobody wouldn't then believe
00:52:33 That post they would believe what they heard before
00:52:36 Oh, yeah, that's that it was all real, but as soon as the person comes clean
00:52:39 They won't believe it because now they're into this stupid idea
00:52:44 They're too far on honestly. Okay. I I don't
00:52:47 Understand the q business model like what exactly does q get out of being q?
00:52:54 Uh, maybe it's maybe it's cool
00:52:57 I don't know. That's that's one. That's a lot of it's cool. That's a lot of deep state questions. You're asking there ben
00:53:03 Yeah, hmm curious. I mean, it's it's I mean are they make I mean are they making money off it somehow?
00:53:08 I don't know. I feel like I never really thought about it, but I could imagine that the person who is q
00:53:14 Well, whoever they are I am Spartacus
00:53:16 Or even if it's one multiple people it could just be
00:53:20 They are as insane as the people who follow them and just I actually believe it
00:53:27 No, I don't think so. I don't think I don't think so because it's like some fucking palm reader shit
00:53:31 Like all the q drops are are cryptic to the point
00:53:33 They're like deliberately cryptic to the point that anyone could read whatever they want into them
00:53:38 It's it feels like it's like oh someone posted in a in a discord the other day a link to uh a
00:53:45 article by a game designer about how q is basically
00:53:49 It's basically an arg designed without any of like the safeguards that are meant to like
00:53:54 Prevent it from like new dead drop too far. It's at the capital like
00:54:00 Yeah, or like when you're building an arg
00:54:02 You have to you have to design it in such a way that like someone who stumbles upon it
00:54:06 Like won't think it's real like if the arg is a murder mystery
00:54:10 You have to make it so that people won't think that like an actual murder
00:54:13 Happened, uh, if they find a divorce from context and q is like an arg without I think that was a joke
00:54:19 That was a joke on trap on chapel trap house where it's like it's an arg for boomers
00:54:26 Yeah, I mean it kind of is yeah this article explained like here's all the same ways in which you know it engages people
00:54:33 You know, there's like the community aspect of that
00:54:35 It's like they give you clues and then everyone is meant to like work
00:54:38 Collectively on like deciphering what it means and the right answer to whatever a q drop means is just whatever the community
00:54:45 Collectively decides is like the most popular or most compelling interpretation
00:54:50 Literally the right answer is just whatever everyone likes the most and that's and that's what that becomes the truth
00:54:55 It's funny. That is kind of there's this podcast. I watch or listen to rather
00:55:00 It's uh, they're called the the argonauts and they they like every couple of weeks like talk about like an arg
00:55:07 Or whatever and just kind of like dissect it and how what like happened
00:55:11 During the course of it and it's really it's really cool. It's a really cool idea for a podcast
00:55:16 Yeah, that sounds interesting. Yeah, that's really all I had to say. I just I like them. Oh, I thought you were gonna
00:55:22 I thought I thought you were gonna make a point. The point is that that's cool. I always want
00:55:26 I always wanted to make an arg
00:55:29 Um, but now I'm old and it's COVID times. So you can't really do a lot of the cool stuff. Args do
00:55:36 All right, here's an idea for an arg. All right. So you um, you give me money
00:55:41 And then trust the plan and then I maybe I'll tell you where to go
00:55:45 You give me money. I mean, I guess I can't be a villain versus a villain
00:55:49 I
00:55:53 Put like secret messages in the paneling of villain verse like that sword quest arg
00:55:59 Um, I should say now that everyone should buy villain verse book two because I am in it
00:56:05 Oh, yeah, Ben. Are you I haven't I haven't read mine yet. Um, it might yeah
00:56:10 Yeah, yours would have been in it tectonic, which reminds me Ben. You gotta you gotta pay that invoice. They didn't pay the invoice yet
00:56:17 Oh, have I not paid the uh, sorry. Sorry. Okay. I'll pay the invoice
00:56:23 I'm sorry. Do you take dogecoin? I sent money to your Kickstarter and I got that um that drawing
00:56:29 Was I supposed to get the digital versions of of the books that were out of the time? Oh, I should
00:56:35 Did I not give you the link? Hold up. I don't think so
00:56:38 Let's see if I still have the link because I've been clearing out my my google drive. Wait, when did you have the kickstart?
00:56:43 No, it was uh, it was a yeah, it was a go for me for my computer
00:56:48 Yeah, oh right
00:56:50 I was like I didn't pledge to that wall. I think I pledged
00:56:54 Wait, didn't you give me like didn't you give me 20 bucks?
00:56:58 Who me? Yeah, didn't you broke for that? I shouldn't have you didn't deserve it
00:57:03 What it's it's cool. I want it back
00:57:06 You know what? I need to reinvest. Take me out of the book. Take me out of the book and give me that 20 bucks
00:57:10 Don't put me. Don't put me in the book. Take me out
00:57:13 All readers of Villainverse grab your white out find Ben snake and just just go over. I'll just go over them
00:57:20 White amount for one of my friends in a high school yearbook
00:57:23 And then just put your own name there
00:57:25 And then and that's that's the cheek. That's the life hack to becoming a cheesy patron without paying me
00:57:30 It's that easy folks
00:57:34 Send send send bent the cut out bent st cut out of the book in an on put it in an envelope
00:57:40 Send it in the mail and that can that's like a coupon
00:57:45 Uh, if you've defaced if you defaced me it's out in the mail wait a couple of weeks
00:57:49 You'll you'll get a gun and then you'll know what to do with that then you become the real villain. Trust the plan
00:57:56 Trust the plan trust the plan
00:57:59 There you go again. That's it's just a google drive with all the
00:58:03 All the at the time was just up to chapter three. I mean we're up to chapter four now
00:58:08 Maybe she's just giving chapter four for free. Maybe I don't know
00:58:11 Ellie is our make sure to put that link in the show notes by the way. Yeah, put that link. Yeah, everyone can read Villainverse
00:58:16 care
00:58:18 I don't care. Um, I just want more people to read Villainverse. That's it. That's all I want. This is all I want
00:58:25 Is that too much to ask?
00:58:27 There's so much that doesn't want to ask to be popular and people to break my the boundaries of my privacy. That's all I want
00:58:34 Uh, yes, it's too much
00:58:36 Damn
00:58:37 That's some shit. Um
00:58:40 Anyway, what are y'all?
00:58:41 What are y'all up to?
00:58:43 What are y'all up to nowadays?
00:58:45 Okay, um, just um, just getting mad on twitter
00:58:49 These these days it's about like wall street hacks and uh and uh msm cronies being like
00:58:55 Ooh, russian. Oh, no russian bots and and white nationalists are buying are buying a gamestop
00:59:03 Every time it's always the same thing every time every time every time
00:59:09 Yeah, I mean you've seen you've seen those articles getting posted around that like this is that the fucking game
00:59:15 Game stop stop shorts short squeeze is just gamergate too for some reason
00:59:21 It all leads back to gamergate
00:59:24 There was that one article where
00:59:26 This one lady was talking about how there is some there's a couple of people out there
00:59:32 Who have anti-semitism beliefs towards like wall street like they think they're hitting the jews where it hurts
00:59:40 Yeah, sure are I don't disbelieve that but
00:59:43 Yeah
00:59:45 It's it's literally the same thing as when uh when van jones on cnn when people were calling a bloomberg and oligarch
00:59:53 And van jones was like, oh, that's anti-semit. That's an anti-semitic slur. Is that the guy that looks like an ace attorney character?
00:59:59 No, that's not cowman. Okay. No, no van jones is like a normal-looking guy, but uh, whatever. He's just some he's just some talking head
01:00:07 Yeah, uh
01:00:09 But yeah, but the point was like the point was like don't like if you don't like how rich this guy is that and you say so
01:00:15 That's anti-semitic because he's a jew. That's yeah, that's so that's so fucked up
01:00:19 That's so fucked up and not to like let anti-semit's off the hook or anything
01:00:22 But like that's the kind of stupid thing that an anti-semit will point to and be like, uh, this is this is what i'm talking about
01:00:29 You can't criticize the jews anymore because they control the media. You can't keep getting away with it
01:00:34 It's just it's just falling into like a very obvious and stupid trap. It doesn't make any sense
01:00:39 Maybe some really fucking mad. I really I have to wonder then
01:00:43 like
01:00:44 The people who think that the like the rich are the jews like equal like and they're like the fucking over the rich
01:00:52 Do they think that?
01:00:53 Ultimately
01:00:55 They should just have the riches themselves. They just want to be up there and they just yeah
01:01:00 It's yeah, but but they're not but they wouldn't be jewish. So it would be okay
01:01:04 I mean, it's like it's that logic that most fascist beliefs have where it's like the enemy has to be weak
01:01:11 But they also have to be incredibly strong at the same time, you know
01:01:15 Because like when they talk about the jews like when they talk about the jews and they describe it
01:01:19 They're like they they themselves are proclaiming themselves to be the superior race
01:01:23 But when they talk about the jews, they keep talking about how the jews outsmart them and it's kind of like
01:01:28 Well, then isn't the jews like better than your race then by that logic?
01:01:33 Well, I mean, okay. I mean to them. It's all about tribalism. So it's like, yeah, okay
01:01:37 If the jews control everything that's bad because they're not me and I and we my tribe should control everything
01:01:44 And that would be better my tribe by the way includes me a tribe called quest. Yeah. Thank you everyone
01:01:50 Bass
01:01:53 Ow
01:01:55 Yeah, that's what it's about. It's it's just it's just the us the generalized us versus them
01:02:00 mentality
01:02:02 Um, man, uh, where how do you even get on this shit? No, I
01:02:07 I had there was something funny. I like noticed though. I remember I was looking
01:02:11 At that article. I mean, specifically the article wasn't saying that they were all antisemites, but there is like
01:02:17 A subsection of the people who are investing in these stocks in these stocks who well, sure
01:02:22 I mean, there's there's a there's a subsection of any group. No, no, I mean, no, I'm not like I'm not like
01:02:27 Thanks to jews control wall street. Yeah. No, I'm not like fucking saying I'm saying like she
01:02:32 She's saying she's not like she's not proclaiming that it's all of them are antisemites
01:02:36 She said there's a subsection of them and then like there's people in the comment to react saying like
01:02:41 Oh, they're they're not all antisemites blah blah blah
01:02:44 And then then right after under them you see people commenting
01:02:47 Oh, well, are you sure it's not the jews controlling everything and then they post like the general like they post a general like
01:02:53 poll charts with the like, um, weird how all these studios are run by jews, huh? And it's like
01:03:00 What's that got to do anything if true?
01:03:03 Yes, yes, sure
01:03:06 Uh, she's funny. I don't know. I used to just find everybody it's weird. It's weird how you see people
01:03:10 It's weird how you see people like claiming that like
01:03:14 That like antisemitism isn't real
01:03:17 Like or and like right alongside other people who are just unironically like actually jews do control
01:03:22 I mean if you like the media and everything and should be destroyed
01:03:26 They'll do it and like
01:03:27 Yeah, but like group a will just we'll just like pretend that group b either is just joking or that like they're just trolling
01:03:33 Or they're just such a small minority that they don't count
01:03:36 They just don't take the two seconds to kind of scroll down
01:03:40 And see that oh shit. There are people like that
01:03:43 It's sort of like a no true scotsman thing like if anyone does espouse such a viewpoint
01:03:48 It's like well, they're an extremist and no one takes them seriously, right?
01:03:51 It's not like a real opinion that a real person has, you know, that's just that's just some crazy talk, you know
01:04:02 I guess the the most annoying thing for me is that like not everybody who holds those views
01:04:07 Holds them strongly enough to know where the logical
01:04:10 Like conclusion would be so if somebody says oh you want the jews to die or whatever
01:04:17 They may not really have thought about that. They just think the jews control everything
01:04:23 Because they've heard that and they just think it's true
01:04:26 And they don't realize that they're in league with people who do want the jews to be killed
01:04:31 And then and then they defend themselves like I don't want I like jews. I know jews. I don't want the jews to die
01:04:37 That's stupid. You're you're you're you're making stuff up
01:04:40 And they just don't understand where their position would lead them logically. I'm sure there's some
01:04:44 Just pisses me off because it's hard to talk to those sort of people
01:04:48 They haven't thought about what they actually believe it. It's a lot of very surface level like answers
01:04:54 You know, I mean, I mean if you're very if you lack if you lack all historical context
01:05:00 I mean, it's not like every it's not like every
01:05:04 A party member in you know, germany in the 1940s or whatever was like
01:05:11 Like yes, I personally would like to execute people of the hebu race like
01:05:16 They weren't all like that most of them were just like yeah, you know
01:05:19 This is this is probably best for our economy or whatever
01:05:24 Swing kids, huh? Or watch that movie
01:05:27 I
01:05:28 No, I guess I'm the only one who's seen it then. Uh, it's a it's about these group of
01:05:33 teenagers in
01:05:35 nazi germany who
01:05:37 Uh, who like swing music, but it's like band or something
01:05:42 Cool
01:05:43 And it's it's kind of sad. It's kind of sad because they because they all they all get caught at like
01:05:48 I'm spoiling swing kids. They all get that
01:05:51 One of them gets beat in the street and killed and the rest like get caught by uh during like some sort of
01:05:58 Like underground dance or something and then they get uh drafted into the military and presumably die
01:06:05 That's so this is like it's like footloose, but it's like nazi footloose kind of is yeah
01:06:10 If kevin bacon was was there things would have been different
01:06:15 If kevin bake, I've never actually seen footloose. I just I've seen that scene in hot rod
01:06:19 That is a parody of footloose
01:06:22 I saw kevin bacon die in the first
01:06:25 Friday the 13th
01:06:26 He's in that
01:06:27 It's it's it. Yeah, I think that that's probably what happened
01:06:31 It's it's that episode of avatar where ang gets all the fire nation kids to have the dance party. This is what happens
01:06:37 So after after ang leaves
01:06:39 Yeah
01:06:41 After he left things are really wet
01:06:43 And you fucked up you fucked the man. Didn't you think about your actions?
01:06:48 No
01:06:52 So deep speaking speaking of fire
01:06:57 Um, I just finished reading the manga fire punch. Have you guys heard of that manga? Is that like fire force? No
01:07:03 It was uh, it was written by the guy who wrote chainsaw man
01:07:06 Was that before after chainsaw man? Yeah, I was right before chainsaw man
01:07:11 Any good and it's uh
01:07:13 I
01:07:14 It was it was good, but it felt very like
01:07:17 Like there wasn't like a
01:07:19 Concrete like goal it was heading to it was kind of like making stuff up as it went along
01:07:24 Yeah
01:07:24 And which isn't necessarily like a bad thing
01:07:27 But like I guess the problem with that is like
01:07:30 Like I mean, okay, so for example when you read like one piece like, you know
01:07:34 Since chapter one, you know what the goal is, you know, it's like oh become king of the pirate
01:07:38 So you said that becomes kind of like a rope for the story, you know, even though one piece could like fluctuating quality
01:07:44 You're still kind of like
01:07:46 Determined to see it to the end, you know
01:07:48 Yeah
01:07:48 So that like that like incentivizes you and then the problem with like manga that like doesn't have a concrete goal
01:07:54 Is that even like the slightest the slightest dip in quality is kind of a big risk
01:08:00 Right, so because it's kind of like why the noise is heading so I don't really want to waste my time, you know
01:08:05 um and fire punch
01:08:06 Well, at least fire punch is like consistently good
01:08:08 But it really does feel like this guy's like making it up as he as he went along
01:08:13 And what people tell me is that chainsaw man has more of a
01:08:16 Concrete cult goal and I guess that's why it lasted longer than a fire punch
01:08:21 I don't want to tell you too much about fire punch, but there is a lot of punching that with fire. So, you know
01:08:27 It doesn't lie. It was so like fairytale
01:08:30 Yeah, is there fairy tales and fairy tales. There's feet
01:08:33 Now fairytale the the main guy in fairytale is he uses fire and he punches
01:08:38 Oh
01:08:40 The base
01:08:43 Oh god, there's this um, there's like this five hour long video
01:08:47 on youtube called a fairytale retrospective
01:08:52 And like I I played that in the background. I was like
01:08:55 Uh cleaning my room to move out because I just needed some bullshit and it's not even a retrospective. He's just like
01:09:02 Reading the entirety of like the Wikipedia articles for like fairytale
01:09:08 You know this isn't a retrospective. You're just fucking just describing what happens
01:09:13 In fairytale now, I know everything that happens in fairytale and I hate it when when you know
01:09:18 slightly like more than the surface level of a subject a lot of youtube videos talking about something start to become
01:09:26 A lot more like Wikipedia
01:09:29 rereads like I've always felt that it's so much of like just
01:09:34 basic information
01:09:36 I was I was looking on like minecraft like I saw one video
01:09:40 Which is like what which is the best way to dig for to find diamonds in the most efficient way
01:09:46 And I was like I kind of want to know so I clicked on it and it was basically just
01:09:52 A bunch of boring uninteresting like if you've never played minecraft before you will learn something
01:09:57 But since I know a little already
01:10:00 It was so devoid of anything actually useful
01:10:03 And I and I cried I cried and I shit myself because it was such a shit videos bad
01:10:10 And I uh liked and subscribed. I um, I kind of had a feeling
01:10:15 similar to watching um
01:10:18 Um, you guys y'all know embleman, right? Uh, yeah. Yay
01:10:22 More or less. I've been like slowly phasing out of not being an embleman fan really, but
01:10:29 But like he made a video because he made that joke, right? What was that?
01:10:32 Because he made that trump joke. Yeah that
01:10:35 Yeah, like he deliberately put like trump propaganda one of his videos
01:10:39 But also, um, I I
01:10:41 That was like vague enough that I couldn't really understand the it sort of seemed like a like a trump like a trump was robbed thing
01:10:48 But it I didn't really see it like that. I could see how it would it was
01:10:52 He dropped the video it was vague enough that like if he said like no
01:10:55 I was just referencing current events in an ironic way. I could be like, yeah, I guess maybe
01:11:00 I mean he was referring to specifically as like, oh, we a trump is a necessity, you know, and it's like
01:11:05 Eh
01:11:07 Wait trump, I don't know. Maybe I'm thinking of a different. Um, I'll repost the clip
01:11:13 But um, that being said, um, he dropped a video talking about like villains and whatnot
01:11:18 And it just basically like it just felt like he was reading like tv trope articles
01:11:23 It didn't feel like he was really like doing an analysis on
01:11:26 Villains god. I I hate it. I was that for that video that thumbnail for that video makes me mad
01:11:32 But please finish your thought that's that's what um, that's what that's what most of the gun videos from ahoy feel like
01:11:39 it's just him like saying which guns were in which video games and
01:11:44 Just sort of like reading from a list
01:11:47 I mean, I could there's probably other better examples
01:11:49 But that's the one that jumps to mind that is the most like this guy literally just went on wikipedia and wrote a list and like
01:11:55 Wrote it in like pros format
01:11:57 And then read it we put video game footage over it
01:12:01 And this is wikipedia, but in video form
01:12:03 What was that guy that was like making cool videos?
01:12:06 And then you disliked him because he made like one about the gorillas
01:12:10 Which is so basic and surface level but people loved it because it was a nice reduced video
01:12:15 Oh, uh, yeah, was it captain christian? Yeah, I don't even remember that video, but I remember
01:12:20 What you're talking about and how captain christian is an idiot
01:12:25 It's just it's I mean this sympathy I remember seeing this. I'm like, oh, yeah, zuko. Yes
01:12:29 He responded to my tweet. He responded to my tweet being salty that I said he saw
01:12:35 pussy
01:12:36 Yeah to that guy. He just dropped off the face of the earth
01:12:40 Well, good
01:12:44 Like his first video was about a a
01:12:47 As a superman fleischer cartoon
01:12:49 Superman I'd never heard or seen of that so that was interesting
01:12:53 But then everything after that was like, oh, I've heard of this. Oh, I've heard of that
01:12:57 Um, okay. Do you have anything new do you have anything like good?
01:13:02 I didn't really
01:13:03 It kind of reminds me on uh, I don't know if you heard this podcast
01:13:06 But it's called the pcp and I remember a member on that podcast. That's right. I remember a member on that podcast said
01:13:13 I can't remember who it's probably didgy
01:13:15 Um, she said something about like you actually not know or this isn't a bit
01:13:19 But it's like something that they said that I do agree with a lot
01:13:23 About like a lot of times captain christian's videos and sometimes other people's videos
01:13:27 Sometimes super ipaduals videos are like this where it's basically like the thesis statement is like, oh this good
01:13:35 Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, I mean, yeah tons of videos are like there's nothing really wrong with that
01:13:42 Like I've done that before I saw one. There's nothing wrong with that because like, you know, sometimes you like to be reassured
01:13:48 Yeah, the thing you like is good or sometimes you want to be sold on something, you know, yeah
01:13:53 I I
01:13:54 Yeah, I guess it's it's like there's nothing wrong with it, but it's it's the um
01:14:00 The highfalutin fancy pants sort of attitude about how cool
01:14:04 Yeah video is even though there's nothing to it
01:14:08 Especially I think part of it comes from like people
01:14:12 People really like when captain christian was making videos people were super into him
01:14:16 I mean me included too because like his editing was really good
01:14:20 so
01:14:21 Yeah, like the the first couple ones I thought they were pretty cool
01:14:25 And then I guess it was the gorillas ones. I was like this if he didn't say anything and like
01:14:29 It wouldn't bother me except that like I had liked the previous ones
01:14:34 Uh, you know it
01:14:36 No, no, that was that's pretty much
01:14:39 What what I think happened with me was that uh, like all of his videos are sort of the same thing where it's like
01:14:46 thing good with really good editing
01:14:49 All right, and here's why?
01:14:51 And and there's nothing really wrong with that, but I think there's this sort of
01:14:56 Like like he got so much praise for it. I think maybe there's part of a almost it's not
01:15:01 It's not like he's the only
01:15:03 Right, it's not like he's the only one who makes videos that are just
01:15:06 Yeah, he was he just sort of came out of nowhere and it seemed like oh this guy's like planned out his youtube career
01:15:12 And it's like wow, this is so like all of the thumbnails are like color-coded and
01:15:17 It's all very very well
01:15:19 Considered, but when you really look at it, it's nothing special
01:15:22 And you would completely forget it and never watch him ever again
01:15:25 And I think people like that and that's what I just sort of lost relevancy lately
01:15:30 I mean, I've never I have not seen videos like that for a long time. I mean there I mean there was
01:15:35 I mean there was a there was a bubble getting recommend. There was definitely a video
01:15:39 There was definitely a video essay bubble that was like captain christian sort of was around like right when it was peaking
01:15:46 Yeah, I mean nerd writer was maybe like sort of the
01:15:50 The the like front man of it for a minute there and that was when when nerd writer was peaking
01:15:55 That's when captain christian showed up and everyone loved his shit
01:15:58 And I think it has deflated. It hasn't like fully popped like people still make video essays
01:16:02 But um, I think it's deflated a bit that particular stuff
01:16:05 Wasn't there like a brief period of time where there were where like every frame of painting was still uploading videos
01:16:11 Hi, my name is Tony captain christian was yeah, this this was the heyday of every frame of painting too
01:16:16 It was around the same time in this specific era where all these video essays are coming out and people were like just enjoying them all
01:16:21 But then in retrospect a lot of them didn't really say that much
01:16:25 I mean every frame of painting stands up. Yeah, I still watch this must be a copycat guy
01:16:30 Well, every frame of painting has a really solid like technical analysis
01:16:33 That like the your average your layman's you were criterion doesn't he able to explain I don't I don't want to like like shit on this person
01:16:40 But I I always saw them
01:16:42 What's like, what are they called?
01:16:45 Now you see it
01:16:46 I always saw them as like an every frame of painting ripoff that was just not quite as good
01:16:50 I've seen their videos and I can't really remember any of their videos
01:16:52 Wait, I'm trying to remember now
01:16:54 It's it's a channel called now you see it and it's like no, I don't talking about
01:16:58 Movies and in the same sort of fashion of like look at this camera move or whatever
01:17:05 But it was just not as good and I just
01:17:08 I don't know. There was a lot of those as well
01:17:11 If something's popular people will copy it. You know what channel i'm really digging recently
01:17:16 Is a accented cinema
01:17:18 You guys heard of this channel? No, no
01:17:20 They um, there are there are chinese guys who like
01:17:23 Analyzes like not just like chinese movies, but he talks about a why like
01:17:29 range of stuff
01:17:31 right and um
01:17:32 I think one of my he did he talked about he said why he didn't he made a video called why I don't like shin godzilla
01:17:38 And I mean, I love a shin godzilla, but I think it's like
01:17:41 It's very I like it when
01:17:44 I do like hearing
01:17:46 Like when people have the opposites like why they don't like the things I
01:17:50 I like you know as long as they're like not you see I just get mad being reasonable
01:17:55 Because they're usually mad too
01:17:58 Yeah, this channel is really good. Um
01:18:01 They have one called how to film a good sword fight, which I think is very interesting and it says a lot of things that they don't think about
01:18:07 um
01:18:08 And they have one on uh, they have one on
01:18:11 Pulgasari you guys ever heard of pulgasari. Yeah, he has like a 4chan board, right?
01:18:16 Hmm, wait, what was that? He has like a 4chan board devoted to discussion about him, right?
01:18:23 Yeah, maybe I don't know. No, pulgasari is the north korean kaiju movie
01:18:29 No, wait, yeah, they all one of those
01:18:32 Oh, yeah, oh, you can watch it all you can watch it all on youtube
01:18:35 I'm actually if you want to hear an analysis on it. I made a podcast about it, but
01:18:41 That be that being said polkas what makes pulgasari so infamous is that the director was like kidnapped from south korea
01:18:48 And forced to make the movie
01:18:50 Is it right?
01:18:53 But the movie is like very interesting because it's I watched it and it's actually a pretty decent like
01:18:59 kaiju movie
01:19:00 But also it could be interpreted as like an anti north korean film or like kind of like
01:19:06 Trying to send a message to the north korean all we agree between the lines, you know
01:19:10 In a way. Yeah, like if you read
01:19:12 Yeah, hold up. I'll uh, you can watch the entirety of the movie on youtube
01:19:17 I'm looking at accented cinemas videos. I'm scrolling down. I see minecraft enslave the populace
01:19:22 I was like, oh, what cool interesting. Oh, it's april fools
01:19:27 So this channel I I hate it. I hate it when when the the april fool is that thing that is cool isn't real
01:19:35 Yeah, it's always better when it's like thing that is cool, but stupid
01:19:41 Is real wait, no wait, no ascented cinema is good. You haven't seen it. Y'all
01:19:46 I'm
01:19:48 Okay, yeah, here's the podcast where we talk about pulgasari. Uh, check out the sick thumbnail
01:19:54 Is that honestly cheesy? I gotta say I love this thumbnail idea where it's just picture from the movie with gun
01:20:02 Yeah, I um, I do that every time I do a podcast about any movie. It's always like, oh, yeah something from the movie with a gun
01:20:10 I just I did it with my uh, dragon quest your story podcast
01:20:15 It's just it's just so funny
01:20:18 I'm pretty sure this might backfire me in some way like youtube's gonna be like, oh if you have a gun in the thumbnail
01:20:23 We're gonna restrict your video or something
01:20:25 We will just kill you that
01:20:28 Christ
01:20:30 I had one of my videos recently like
01:20:33 Like automatically manually
01:20:35 Set as made for kids because I wasn't swearing in it or something
01:20:40 So that I couldn't make money off of it anymore
01:20:43 Like they they sent me an email saying we've uh reviewed your video like this hadn't been flagged or anything
01:20:49 It was just like suddenly we've reviewed this video and we've just determined that it is made for kids
01:20:54 So now it is made for kids
01:20:56 Oh, thanks
01:20:58 Which um
01:21:00 I mean it was one of my old pony videos. So I'm like whatever
01:21:03 Yeah, but you know, I can see why but like I don't like that. They can just flip a switch to do that
01:21:10 Yeah, that is annoying
01:21:12 It is incredibly annoying. I wish there was humans in between where you could talk to you about this shit, but nope
01:21:18 Nope, no humans cost money who we don't want to spend that
01:21:22 Is cheesy in a fancy world right now?
01:21:24 Uh, it's one of my roommates is probably playing the little piano and playing melodica. That's funny
01:21:31 It's telling me
01:21:33 More than half of the roommates here play an instrument
01:21:37 Um, you could have like a little band
01:21:39 I could I'll uh, I'll be I'll be uh, the the lyricist. I I know how to write man. I'm pretty good at it
01:21:45 Yeah, I could be that I went to um music videos. I went to a concert once remember concerts guys. Haha. Anyway, uh,
01:21:52 No, we're the
01:21:54 Welcome back. I'm back by the way and by tectonic the thing you said about uh, april fools
01:21:59 Uh, I remember you said the same thing in your rpg video
01:22:03 About the about the the april fools better when the thing is real. Yeah, okay. Just had to have someone dead
01:22:12 Yeah, but it's it's
01:22:15 There was I went to this concert once where um, it was like a
01:22:19 It was like a dual
01:22:22 Like a dual performance or whatever
01:22:24 Uh, or it's like two two headlining acts one goes after the other and I me and my sister
01:22:29 We really only wanted to see the the second act
01:22:32 but we went through the opening one anyway because it's like, you know, whatever uh, and
01:22:37 They weren't great. It wasn't really like it was kind of like boomer-ish music
01:22:41 But uh, they had like a hype man for some of their songs. It was just it was just this like
01:22:46 Uh, like lanky black dude with like a like a fedora and like a black suit
01:22:50 And he's just kind of like walking around the stage like getting everyone super excited and it it was
01:22:57 Confuddling me. I had no idea like what the point of him was
01:23:02 because like the music
01:23:04 It was it was it was just like rock music
01:23:07 So I feel like do you really need a hype band like that and is that all he does and it was it was all he did
01:23:12 He was like part of the touring band so strange
01:23:17 That is incredibly strange. Um, very it's very vivid in my mind. I don't remember the songs. I remember the hype man
01:23:25 One time I remember there was this girl. I had a crush on
01:23:29 And um, one of one of those artists that we both like was in town
01:23:33 And I asked him like hey, you're going to this concert and she's like, uh, maybe and then I'm like, well, it'd be cool to see you there
01:23:39 Am I right and then like the day of the concert
01:23:43 She'd be at me saying like you're still going to that concert and I'm like, yeah, and then she's like, okay cool
01:23:47 Me and my boyfriend are going to
01:23:51 I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh awesome. It's like, uh, actually I have covid so I can't go
01:24:01 This is like three years before I have a normal strain of the coronavirus. Oh, sorry
01:24:07 But um, no, I have that weird lung thing from vaping. I have uh looks at year
01:24:16 I look so anyway
01:24:17 I show up to the venue early because I had a bar and I decided to get stupid drunk
01:24:21 Because I did not want to meet her boyfriend sober and it was great actually and after that I realized
01:24:26 Whoa, I love going to shows super drunk. So now I'm super drunk at every show
01:24:31 I usually get like a drink, but I don't
01:24:34 Plastered
01:24:36 I love I love getting uh, super drunk
01:24:39 Getting getting getting plastered in like a public bar. It's it's the only way to feel
01:24:45 Like uh, you're not gonna
01:24:47 It's it's strange the only way to feel like you're not embarrassing yourself is to be a little drunk
01:24:53 So you so you don't actually
01:24:56 Makes the the last the last time I got drunk in like a public bar
01:25:01 I ended up like I ended up like, uh
01:25:04 It was when I lost my wallet and I kept asking the bartender where my wallet was and I like heckled
01:25:09 I like heckled a fucking like stand-up
01:25:12 I got told to shut I got told to shut up by the management
01:25:16 And uh, and then I went back when I went I've told this boy when I went back and asked the bartender like hey
01:25:21 Do you find what he's like you asked me this like 40 times yesterday? No, I don't have your wallet
01:25:25 He's glared at me and it was like the worst feeling that's kind of familiar
01:25:29 Yeah, yeah, I mean this was like this one. Okay. This was like a year and a half ago. Yeah, because this was pre-covid
01:25:34 But yeah, that was the last time I got drunk at all. Yeah, and I felt and I felt so terrible about it. It was traumatizing
01:25:41 It was just one time
01:25:46 Known as an annoyance. Yeah, when you didn't say
01:25:50 No, the fact the fact that that I was annoying enough that this guy who works at a bar where people go to get drunk
01:25:55 That I stood out in his mind as being like particularly obnoxious
01:25:59 No, oh
01:26:01 fuck
01:26:02 Yeah
01:26:03 Okay, okay
01:26:04 I think I think though that it was a bad influence because I was with because I was with that weird girl
01:26:08 And I think that she was the one it started heckling and I think I just kind of followed her lead
01:26:13 No, I think that's why it was the girls fault. I didn't do anything. I'm innocent
01:26:18 It was all the woman. It's always a woman's fault. She ate the apple. She ate the apple first
01:26:22 She's from she stole my rib and then she ate the apple
01:26:26 And that's why that's why mankind is like in a fallen state. God the problem is that we're raised by our mothers. That's the problem
01:26:34 I
01:26:35 one time at a show I uh
01:26:38 I
01:26:39 Think this was probably the last concert I went to was I went to see like Cara Cara Bonito in uh
01:26:43 In boston or whatever and I was getting some I was getting some cash out of the atm
01:26:48 And I noticed that there was an id on the ground. I was like, oh my god, someone dropped their id
01:26:53 Uh, I I should probably go pick. I should probably go report this or something. I pick it up. It's fucking my id
01:26:58 I dropped my id on the ground
01:27:00 somehow
01:27:01 I was like, I was like, what if you didn't realize that you well, thank god
01:27:05 What do you what what what venue was it at in boston? I remember it was um, oh shit
01:27:12 It it was somewhere. I've been
01:27:14 In
01:27:16 Was it the middle east? No, it wasn't the middle east. It it it was
01:27:20 It wasn't the paradise
01:27:22 Rock, oh, maybe it was the paradise rock club or something like that. Oh, I never I know it was
01:27:29 I have no fucking clue. Yeah, I'm just gonna say it was the paradise rock club
01:27:34 What if you went to go
01:27:36 You didn't realize it was your ideas id so you went to go give it to them and they looked at the idea and then they looked at you
01:27:41 And they're like, is this a fucking joke
01:27:45 The idea was kind of old
01:27:46 So so I don't know if I looked like the picture. I had sure I look like Mike. Uh, actually
01:27:51 Yeah, I probably look like minecraft steve and my fucking id god my head is so square. That's fucking cool as shit
01:27:57 Uh, man, I I mean, I don't like it. My my younger cousin would bully me
01:28:01 My zoomer cousin would be like shut up minecraft steve when they look at minecraft steve minecraft steve. No, no
01:28:07 Minecraft steve, please no
01:28:10 Won't you go mine diamonds minecraft steve? I never played minecraft. I don't understand what your zoomers are telling her saying to me
01:28:18 I'm hero brine
01:28:21 I am not minecraft steve. Oh god damn. I was
01:28:25 Oh, it's been a little it's been a little while since we did a pcp minecraft
01:28:28 I'm gonna say hasn't it been like isn't it's two weeks a little while? Oh man, maybe I guess internet time
01:28:34 We've been trying to do it more regularly. I guess word
01:28:38 Yeah word word did you uh the uh, did I did I tell you that I that I spent a while off stream?
01:28:45 Uh, just like mining marble. I mean, there's like there's like four chests full of marble. Yeah, and uh, what can you do with marble?
01:28:52 I haven't played minecraft since like we're building gibbs, uh abby's play 12 or something
01:28:59 Uh, also, um
01:29:01 Hey, okay, so we've been I don't know if this is the time to talk about it
01:29:04 But like maybe maybe those abby should have been made with like marble facades instead of full marble blocks
01:29:11 What do you mean facade? Is that a thing?
01:29:14 I mean
01:29:16 There's a there. I mean, I think one of the mods lets you make a yeah
01:29:19 Like you can make not a full block, but just like a very thin sort of like
01:29:24 Less than half a block of that has like the brick marble texture on it. I think
01:29:31 I mean, it's too late now
01:29:33 I mean at the moment I need like the I need like nether
01:29:36 um, nether quartz
01:29:40 Shit
01:29:41 uh
01:29:43 Well, I mean there's I mean uh, uh maren maren made the uh, the machine that is just like generating infinite nether quartz
01:29:49 pan
01:29:50 Oh, yeah
01:29:52 God those mods are so fucking strange. Oh
01:29:56 We still haven't I mentioned this before I I still next time we play I have a
01:30:00 A gift for you that will make maren very angry. Yeah, we should we should play. I can't fucking wait
01:30:07 Yeah, we should yeah for sure
01:30:09 And you should all go to the fucking pcb minecraft
01:30:13 uh
01:30:13 patreon
01:30:15 Uh, and uh, so you can have infinite nether quartz by a mage
01:30:21 No
01:30:24 I think maren runs it
01:30:27 Maren pan is a is uh the the one of the uh big time minecraft gods is what they is
01:30:35 Oh, wait, yeah, this might be off topic, but I did you see that like last week? I I um
01:30:42 I clipped out my my pan peaks are rent from that one pcb episode and I edited it right next to the pan
01:30:49 Yes, yeah, I saw and I finally uploaded to my channel
01:30:52 I saw that and like that got me like six new subscribers on the spot because of it
01:30:57 Dude six. I want to say
01:31:01 Okay, one one last thing about the pcb minecraft server is I was doing I was doing the top killers like art stream
01:31:08 Uh day before yesterday, I think
01:31:10 and you know, I was editing the top killers uh image and people the subject of um
01:31:17 Minecraft came up and someone maren pan was in the chat and
01:31:22 Someone was like, uh, oh maren pan is the guy like oh maren pan. It's cool. He built like he's building like the full scale
01:31:28 Uh, uh
01:31:29 New os angela city, you know thing in minecraft and everyone was like, oh, wow, that's really cool. Oh, well, that's really cool
01:31:35 and someone was like, uh like
01:31:38 But someone was like, oh, but you know, it's if you have to pay to get in the server and it was I was like
01:31:43 I was a little I don't know how to feel because I was like, oh, that's good
01:31:46 That like there's a cool thing in the pcb minecraft server that someone might want to like pay money to get access to
01:31:52 But also like, oh
01:31:54 These these rfck heads are like they're they're cut off from the
01:31:59 From the goods
01:32:01 It's it's only five bucks a month. It's only it's only five bucks a month and uh
01:32:06 maren pan's a full scale recreation of nlaka come is is always growing
01:32:11 Downtown I think is basically done and it looks fucking sick
01:32:15 Um, okay, I don't know. That was that was just an experience that it happened and I made me lull
01:32:22 Fuck you. Fuck everyone that doesn't uh, that's not in the server
01:32:26 Give us money. Give us money. It's pretty. It's pretty money. Give us money. Yeah
01:32:33 No, I I um
01:32:35 No, sometimes when I'm just like want to relax. I just pop in there and mine some ports or whatever
01:32:41 And usually there's nobody in there usually most people on the show for the streams
01:32:46 Uh, but not always sometimes people are around
01:32:50 Okay, that's enough. That's all I have to say about that
01:32:53 but but but based
01:32:55 um
01:32:57 Well, I've I guess one thing that I've noticed was interesting
01:33:01 I don't know how many people of how many of you guys follow philosophy tube
01:33:05 Oh, yeah
01:33:07 Oh, yeah
01:33:09 I mean, I'm not like caught up. But yeah, she she she uh has as abagail
01:33:16 Forced to tube made a coming out video, which is very cool
01:33:20 and
01:33:21 like very
01:33:22 Classy in in all aspects of the coming out very classical abby
01:33:27 I I have not I have not watched how did he do it better than I have not watched the video
01:33:33 Uh
01:33:34 Um, okay. Anyway. Yes, great. We love to see it
01:33:37 We love to see another pcp member transition awesome
01:33:43 They they're inspired by the pcp. Yeah, they um, they saw the jenny's
01:33:48 Gives did did anyone's transition. Okay. I'm sure I'm sure that probably nobody
01:33:53 I'm sure nobody else cares and nor should they but did anyone see peter coffins reaction to it. Yeah. Yeah, I was very
01:33:59 What did they say?
01:34:02 What did they say you fucking bigot, sorry
01:34:07 I'm very sorry
01:34:10 Pete peter coffins said peter coffins reaction to abagail coming out
01:34:15 And everyone being very supportive was to to tweet like when I came out as non-binary a mainstream magazine ran a piece on how
01:34:23 I was a male appropriating feminism
01:34:25 Damn, like just being salty. I mean, that's okay. That does suck like so
01:34:31 Okay, it it does suck it does suck but like
01:34:36 Why it's it's it's very sour. Why it's like, oh like it's it's like to to bring it to bring it up right then
01:34:43 It's like it's just pure sour grapes and it's really unfortunate. It made me pretty mad. Yeah
01:34:48 Um, you know that peter coffee used to follow me on twitter
01:34:52 Yeah
01:34:55 Yeah, they did for a moment. I followed them back but then like the more ridiculous their tweets came out
01:35:01 I was like, okay. I think this is enough. I think i'm just gonna stick to your ex who has fat tits
01:35:07 Speaking of fat tits abagail Shapiro
01:35:11 Um, uh, no, I don't I don't like her. I don't like uh, she like
01:35:16 She is look can I be a look can I be a little misogynistic for a second?
01:35:22 Of course, of course, of course. No by all means. No, she's gonna be the cheesy misogynist for a minute here
01:35:29 If I could just be ironic for a moment your honor. It's it's like she's not she's not really
01:35:35 She's not really that funny like not all
01:35:38 Dutton she's really not very little like banger tweets to be honest and she doesn't even
01:35:43 I don't even show that many like she's not funny. There's like there's like other if you say it's because of her boobs
01:35:48 There's like other twitter. Yeah, there's like other twitter girls with big boobs
01:35:51 Obviously people follow her because she's got huge tits. She's not that funny and honestly. I think her face is kind of gross
01:36:01 She's she's like talking about are we talking about the lady who has the
01:36:06 Yes, yes, I don't know who she is. Okay. I don't blame you
01:36:11 this is this
01:36:13 Uh much much like how peter coffin was caddy about the philosophy
01:36:17 To coming out this conversation is very caddy
01:36:20 True. I'm not being caddy. I'm just saying she's not that funny
01:36:24 People follow her for the way she looks and I don't like the way she looks. So what's the what's the appeal?
01:36:28 There's none. I'm being a big cap boy right now a big cap boy right now. Um
01:36:33 Fun. All I'm saying all I'm saying is that like I've seen other
01:36:37 lefties
01:36:39 Uh girls with big boobs who show more big boobs than actually does they're more praxis and funny
01:36:45 That
01:36:47 I want to say I want to say I'm not I'm not I'm not angry. I'm not jealous
01:36:52 That uh punish that punish that punish friday and flip friday and slip
01:36:58 I'm not jealous that um that ashley follows michelle. All right. I'm not jealous. That's not why I'm saying this
01:37:05 Wait, really does she yeah? Yeah, they follow each other. Why I don't know why
01:37:10 Because michelle also makes funny tweets, which are I think funnier
01:37:14 I think they have the same I do find michelle funnier even though
01:37:17 bishchelle is like my enemy
01:37:20 um
01:37:21 She's my she's my nemesis
01:37:23 um
01:37:24 If people if the audience don't know what i'm talking about i'm talking about michelle. Um
01:37:28 Girl girl nate girl best guy if you will
01:37:32 The best guy girl. That's we should get michelle on the show. Oh, we should
01:37:36 We should yeah, we should me. Yeah, cuz I yeah, we should. Yeah, totally. Yeah, didn't you listen to get her on the horn?
01:37:43 Cheesy didn't you listen to the intro me and tectonic? Yeah, you know
01:37:47 Veteran members of the pcp. Come on. I should have never played that game of blackjack
01:37:52 I I regret everything that has happened since then we're kicking out now. We're gonna kick you two out
01:37:58 And then we're gonna invite gamers tavern as a permanent member
01:38:02 And then the transition will be complete
01:38:04 No
01:38:07 All i'm asking is to put look if I if i'm a guest at the same time michelle is like that'll be a big fight and that'll be entertaining
01:38:15 i'm just saying
01:38:17 Yeah, probably back in the show and ben. Yeah ben there me and ben could double to hear her
01:38:21 Shut up. All i'm saying
01:38:23 All i'm saying all i'm saying is look at her face and look at her lipstick
01:38:28 And how her lipstick goes above her lips
01:38:32 It's so weird looking and it makes me mad. I hate it
01:38:36 I hate it. Is that about michelle? Is this the is it? No, it's about no ash
01:38:42 I hate ash's lipstick is bizarre
01:38:45 The cheesy misogynist and the biggest saint once again united together. Shut the fuck up. I hate you
01:38:51 I hate everyone honestly honestly. No unironically whenever anyone tells me that i'm being misogynistic because I think a girl is ugly
01:38:59 Fuck you. You are the you are the misogynist
01:39:02 Uh, it's it should be okay to say that about anyone. Uh, I'm so fucking mad. I hate all of you. I hate everything
01:39:08 I'm not the misogynist. You are
01:39:11 Yes, unironically. No, not me you. No, not me you every single time
01:39:16 I may be a misogynist
01:39:18 But at least i'm not a liar
01:39:21 You are though you're both of those things. I think I mean in this instance
01:39:27 Uh
01:39:28 From what I've seen like she goes to great lengths to show off her attractiveness
01:39:33 So to critique her attractiveness is not like misogynistic. It's just like thank you
01:39:39 It's part of what you know like her appeal and if you don't agree with it then
01:39:43 You know, I said the same I said the same thing about I said the same thing about maryc deville and everyone got on my ass about
01:39:49 You know what? You know what? I like to have what I like to state a formal apology to benzade. I'm sorry

01:40:07 I'm free now. I can be as much misogynist as I want to be
01:40:11 Ha ha just kidding. I'm even more misogynist. Let the bigotry commence
01:40:17 It's the it's the sicko sky. Yeah, benzade is the sicko on the window. Yeah
01:40:23 Go in sicko mode
01:40:25 Oh, god. Ha ha. Yes. Yes speak. Okay. So anyway, I remember when we were talking about analysis videos earlier. No
01:40:34 Um, so anyway, I just brought that up
01:40:36 Because I was gonna I was gonna show my own analysis video coming soon
01:40:41 Doge dogecoin plummeting dogecoin plummeting cheesy cheesy
01:40:45 It was up to four. We need to go to four. It's going down. It's going down. It's
01:40:49 Oh, wait, no, never mind. Never mind. He's canceling his video. He's canceling his video. I'm canceling my analysis video. I'm canceling it

01:40:59 Is it gonna hit 0.3? Will it go below 0.35? You've crashed. I don't know what I want. Oh my god. This is it
01:41:04 Tom, Tom, get out. Tom, bail.
01:41:06 Get out of there, Tom. Tom. Tom. No. Tom.
01:41:12 Don't, no. I'm already dead.
01:41:15 Damn
01:41:17 I learned I learned uh
01:41:19 The real doge's name
01:41:22 It's very cute. The the doge that the the meme is based on's name is um
01:41:27 Oh my god
01:41:29 Fuck I can't kabosu. That's a weird name. It's kabosu. Oh my god. That's a weird name
01:41:34 Kabosu it's the name of like a citrus fruit and the owner named it that because it had a round face
01:41:41 Like a cut over and that is cute kabosu or an or or an orange. Yeah. I do love cheap
01:41:48 I'm a big fan of chimes myself. I think chimes is the best variant
01:41:52 Is it a is it a hot take that I think chimes is funnier than doge? If it is then I stand by it
01:41:58 I think yeah, I think chimes is better. I mean, I love love doge
01:42:01 Love doge, but I think I prefer chimes. Yeah, just objectively. Chimes just looks cool. Like let me let me show you a picture
01:42:07 Let me show you my favorite
01:42:09 I've seen I know what chimes looks like. No, let me show you my favorite chimes picture when when you see when you see buff doge
01:42:15 And and like the little crying yellow dog. The yellow dog is chimes. Look at look at this guy. He looks like an anime protagonist
01:42:23 Yeah, chimes is they're both cheapy. Yeah, it's not the same dog. Yeah once they are
01:42:29 Chimes chimes, uh, wait, let me find the original way his legs are sitting. Yeah
01:42:35 He's he has an anime protagonist that
01:42:39 I mean, there's the there's the meme image which is the meme image is like
01:42:44 Very similar to the actual picture
01:42:47 But like the actual picture is like funnier
01:42:49 Yeah, yeah, the actual picture is like is really good
01:42:55 Versus um versus this this is like the meme which is like slightly distorted and like yellow. I guess it's pretty much
01:43:01 That's not yellow. It's just a squish down. That's natural. I love his face. Yeah, it looks like he's stinking. He's having a big think
01:43:08 He looks like he's a little annoyed about something. The funniest thing about it. I think is that he has no neck whatsoever
01:43:15 His snout starts and his body begins. Do you guys want to see one of my uh, I made like a his name his name is his name is Baltzy
01:43:24 I did one of those like, um, I did one of those like gene addicts. He has no ears. No ears whatsoever
01:43:30 No, vulture. Don't steal it. I've never seen Spiderman. He's like got the um the same
01:43:35 He's he's got the like the same energy as like a seal that's squished his neck
01:43:40 Like his head into his body
01:43:42 Like like receding a receding dog
01:43:46 He's just like herm big think
01:43:49 Having a big old think right now
01:43:53 Wait, wait, sorry, but uh, I just I like
01:44:01 Oh
01:44:03 Hell yeah, Ben saying when you call him the size of this
01:44:10 Stop right there
01:44:14 How dad
01:44:19 I want to I want to photoshop it with like glasses that make a purple so he matches Ben's like
01:44:25 Oh
01:44:29 James is funnier. I didn't I didn't realize it was a different dog even
01:44:34 Yeah
01:44:36 Oh to be fair, you can't have cheese without doughers. So I think you know, you got to respect your elders
01:44:42 Yeah, all the same family there. Okay. I was reading an article
01:44:46 I read an article about you know, original doge 8 say aka kabosu and the article said that there's like another
01:44:53 Shiba Inu who was also sometimes called doge
01:44:57 And it's just some american guy's dog that wore a bandana and like I'd never seen this other one
01:45:03 before
01:45:05 Yeah, so like top notch aesthetics
01:45:09 And like I feel like the the article was like, yeah, these both of these dogs became
01:45:14 Doge and I was like, who the fuck is that other one?
01:45:17 Like this is this this one did not stand the test of time
01:45:20 Uh, which one?
01:45:23 I'm looking. Sorry. I'm there's an article. I'm going meme hunting
01:45:29 I am going meme hunting. Um
01:45:32 this is
01:45:34 Doge was what the article was called
01:45:37 Yeah, okay. It was from the verge. It was called what the article was called. Wow, this is doge
01:45:43 and
01:45:46 Okay, I this one
01:45:49 Like what is this
01:45:51 Yeah, I've never seen this. This looks terrible. Never seen it before. Yeah, but the article like makes like yeah
01:45:56 Yeah, this this one is also doge. It looks like a
01:46:00 Boomer mistake
01:46:02 I used to hate this. I used to hate the doge meme. I don't know. I honestly, I think I still hate the much
01:46:08 Wow, so whatever. Yeah, that's that's dumb. But the comeback was was really good
01:46:14 It was never that funny. What do you mean the come on to gen two doge than gen one doge
01:46:19 Gen one just had way too many like like bugs. Okay. I mean the I mean like the the wow much amazing
01:46:25 Is like fine. I don't know like it's okay. It's yeah. Well, sure
01:46:31 What's what's second edition doge? Is it like doge's v-teams?
01:46:35 Is that is that the revival like you know back in 2019 when when
01:46:40 Doge just started being popular again. It was more all-encompassing
01:46:45 Hmm
01:46:47 This is one picture now. We're just posting memes. All right, here's the stuff
01:46:52 Here's a free here's a free cheat. Here's a free team emoji if anyone travels
01:46:58 Cool, I just I just love how he looks. He looks so adamant
01:47:02 Some someone's got to make team coin and then the cycle will will close. I would invest in a team coin
01:47:08 I would probably start doing bitcoin if someone made it today
01:47:12 I probably would because I feel like it would be destined to like be a serious doge coin competitor
01:47:17 Finally a coin for me
01:47:20 PCP heads, you know what to do
01:47:23 Yeah, PCP assemble
01:47:27 Do your thing
01:47:29 Oh boy. So sheaves. Sheaves are pretty cute. I like sheaves a lot
01:47:33 I I have been um
01:47:37 In my room all week because I got covid
01:47:41 Uh, I didn't buy the shirt. I actually got covid 19
01:47:46 Esquire
01:47:47 Uh, and I work. I don't know exactly how I got it. I work at at a middle school
01:47:53 So it could have been something to do with that. I'm not sure
01:47:57 But um, it's god damn children. Yeah
01:48:00 It was it wasn't too bad like my symptoms were were mostly mild
01:48:06 It just kind of never went away and I still can't really taste things
01:48:10 Uh
01:48:13 Since I've been in my room all week, I've pretty much done like nothing but play video games and uh, yeah
01:48:19 And one of the video games I've been playing was uh, I picked up
01:48:24 Uh, like fire emblem echoes after not playing it for like three fucking years and then I ended up beating it
01:48:30 After after so long and now I'm in a huge fire emblem hole. I'm playing all I'm playing games
01:48:37 Constant fire emblem. I wanted
01:48:40 I wanted to do a video
01:48:42 on on the
01:48:43 The sacred stones the one for the game boy advance
01:48:46 Because I really I really liked that game, but I was I felt I was feeling like
01:48:52 Oh almost like an imposter syndrome. God damn it fucking
01:48:57 Among us has ruined the word imposter, but I I felt I felt almost you were you were feeling suss
01:49:02 I was feeling a little suss. I was feeling a little suss when I was a little sick
01:49:06 feeling a little suss
01:49:07 When I was when I was working on it because I was just like
01:49:10 Like because because I was talking about things I like in the game
01:49:13 But but I was also feeling like almost inadequate in a way because I don't really know too much
01:49:21 Like I'm not as big in fire emblem as some people are
01:49:25 Because I've played I played like the sacred stones like years ago and then I played echoes. I've played three houses
01:49:32 And I'm making my way through some of the older ones now. I'm playing through genealogy
01:49:35 which is like the fourth one that never came out over here and um
01:49:40 I I just I just feel
01:49:43 I don't know it's it's it's the first time I ever really felt like I wanted to do like a video on something
01:49:47 But I've also felt like under qualified in a way
01:49:51 And it's
01:49:53 I feel that
01:49:56 Uh, what do you feel like you gotta play the whole series before you can talk about it or
01:50:01 I I I just feel like I should I I should know a little more about the games because
01:50:06 It's it kind of goes back to what I was saying earlier about the um
01:50:11 About how like, you know, as soon as you know something about a series
01:50:16 A lot of stuff on youtube starts to feel surface level and I don't want to feel surface level when making
01:50:22 A video about a game. I really like like the sacred stones
01:50:25 So
01:50:27 Yeah, I I felt like that when I was making my my heroes of my magic videos
01:50:32 Yeah, where I realized that oh wait
01:50:34 I'm just just playing these and trying to make a video quickly because like more videos equals good
01:50:41 And so I didn't really get into the game for long enough to have much to say about it and
01:50:47 Anyone who has played the game
01:50:49 Would be able to immediately see that I have just not really into it
01:50:55 And it was like it's so much easier to write scripts about games. I played for years
01:51:01 And so like playing new games and making reviews on those it's like
01:51:06 I don't know that you can't really do much more than at first impressions
01:51:09 Unless you really put the work in to try and completely understand every facet of it
01:51:14 Then you can make something interesting and different
01:51:17 it um
01:51:19 Uh
01:51:20 In well while I was in this hole. I found this uh fire emblem guy on youtube
01:51:25 He most he mostly just like streams iron man
01:51:28 Playthroughs of the game where like if a character dies you just keep going and those are fun
01:51:32 But he has like a couple of video essays. You mean a normal playthrough. Yeah
01:51:37 Yeah, but like uh, you know how like sometimes without resets. Yeah without resets. Yeah
01:51:43 Yeah, so you just so you just I don't know. I feel like in a game like a fire emblem is like
01:51:48 Like permadeath is like a major like thing about it. I feel like you would be I don't know
01:51:52 I would feel compelled to not do any resets if I fucked up and someone died
01:51:57 I would feel like that would be that's how I play these fucking games and it's on
01:52:00 I'm kind of I'm trying to find a way to to sort of shake shake my way out of it and just sort of move on
01:52:06 Wait, you you you do the reset. I do resets. Yeah, that's how I played. I mean no judgment
01:52:11 I just think it would be more fun. No, no, it's fine
01:52:14 Yeah, I think I'd be more fun if like the stakes would be higher. I'd be like a lot of judgments
01:52:19 A lot of judgment on my side. True
01:52:22 It's like um, you know nuzlocke sort of yeah
01:52:26 Stakes and that's like kind of the fun of the game is that is that you get you get like named characters with backstories and stuff
01:52:31 But they can legit die. It's cool. It's a cool mechanic
01:52:35 And if you like reset, you're not really
01:52:38 Yeah, you're turning you're turning losing that character into losing progress
01:52:42 Which is a it's still you know, it still sucks because like you can get through most of a chapter
01:52:47 But if one of your guys dies, I think fuck when I was young I I never like considered
01:52:53 Continuing if a character died. Yeah, because I was always gonna be I was always afraid that later on in the game
01:53:00 I would not have enough power to even
01:53:03 Like stand any chance of winning and if you get all the way to the end there are like usually you get so many guys
01:53:11 That I mean, yeah, but they I've never really
01:53:16 Like I always reset if a character dies and I always try to maximize the amount of experience I get from every level
01:53:22 Yeah, every every um mission or whatever. That's pretty much how I play it. That's kind of why that's kind of why I like
01:53:27 I know it's like kind of a controversial
01:53:30 Edition, but I like that the uh, the newer games have that sort of rewind time feature
01:53:36 Oh, yeah, I guess it just saves time
01:53:39 But it also like
01:53:41 removes
01:53:41 Because like losing time having to do things again is a punishment that you don't want to happen
01:53:46 So it does raise the stakes and make you think more about what you're doing. Yeah, it's 100. That's definitely true
01:53:53 Yeah, sure, but this was uh, this is like the video that kind of got me
01:53:57 That that I thought was really good and and started making me think like oh geez
01:54:02 Should I be making this fireman video? This guy knows like way more stuff about these games than I do
01:54:07 So I just kind of been watching him
01:54:10 The video you've been wanting to make already
01:54:13 No, he hasn't
01:54:14 There's not really there's not the thing is with
01:54:17 I want to do a video on sacred stones because there's not really like a
01:54:20 A video that kind of just like really goes into that game in particular
01:54:26 I think it's kind of underrated
01:54:29 I'm good. Um, you can still make your video and then just admit that like oh, I got a lot of my
01:54:34 Information from this guy check him out. He's really cool. Sure. Sure. Yeah, I probably appreciate the shout out too
01:54:41 I uh, I'm not like a funny gimmick. You could be like, uh, how can you beat fire emblem sacred stones without pressing up?
01:54:50 something like that
01:54:54 Let's find out gamers
01:54:56 You get like 75% of the way through the game. It's like, oh you come
01:55:02 That's not satisfying
01:55:04 There's actually two areas where you just need to press up and that's it. So I flip the controller upside down and we're good
01:55:13 Hack
01:55:15 cheats tectonic cheats
01:55:18 Take that. I do donkey kong
01:55:20 Tropical freeze without using a single button just shaking the Wii remote
01:55:24 Can can I play minecraft at high volume without waking up my mother? Let's find out
01:55:30 No, no, I can't
01:55:32 Wait, mom. No. No. It's a stream. It's a stream mom
01:55:36 Oh god
01:55:38 Um, damn, I have a can I get through the day without mentally breaking down?
01:55:43 ha ha
01:55:45 Yes
01:55:46 Because I'm built different
01:55:48 Um, I built like a truck. Yeah, I have a happy truck. I have the opposite of depression
01:55:53 I don't know what that is, but I'm pretty sure I have the opposite of it
01:55:57 It's pretty epic. Uh
01:56:00 Oh pressure
01:56:02 Yeah, oh pressure because I'm brown. Yes. Oh, yeah, I like
01:56:08 Ethan Ethan Klein just tweeted uh to hold to hold the game stop line
01:56:13 Uh pretty well now that he said it
01:56:17 I was I was gonna sell but
01:56:20 I mean
01:56:21 Honestly, I I've been I've been having a lot of fun
01:56:24 Just going on r slash wall street bets and seeing all the top posts that are just like
01:56:28 I just poured in like $200,000 into game so hold the line and other people like I have literally a million dollars in game
01:56:35 Stop. I'm not selling no matter what everybody holds
01:56:38 Uh, it's awesome
01:56:40 Hold the line Bart
01:56:43 Part of me part of me
01:56:45 Part of me wishes I just put my entire fortune my fortune lull into uh like my whole my like all my money into game
01:56:51 Stop, but no not again not after not after bitcoin
01:56:56 Not not if if if the stock you have in game stop becomes huge
01:57:02 um
01:57:03 Then maybe you could consider but like hold the line. Well, but then it'll be too late line for
01:57:09 Yeah, I don't know that's that's the big question. Do you want to get a nice fat page?
01:57:13 I want to get a do I want to get a lot of money or a little over the billionaires a little bit
01:57:18 I do what the fucking billion is
01:57:20 I mean if if the stock blows up, I will make a decent chunk of money
01:57:24 I might I mean if it goes really high, I might make like a few thousand dollars, which would be pretty cool
01:57:29 um, but uh, I don't know that's seemed that's like the most optimistic
01:57:33 scenario
01:57:36 I'll I'll be happy if I don't lose anything, you know
01:57:39 That would be every day
01:57:41 I honestly the thing I'm worried about is like
01:57:44 Melvin liquidates they sell they they they buy back their shares
01:57:48 The market like goes up and but I like I miss it and then like it like crashes back down immediately after and I'm like, oh
01:57:54 It's too late
01:57:56 melvin brother of the joker
01:57:58 melvin brother of the joker
01:58:01 uh
01:58:03 Hey, I think so i'm working let's check in on dogecoin dogecoin is
01:58:08 It's bouncing back a little bit
01:58:10 Check in on cheap cheap coin while you're out there cheap coin cheap coin
01:58:15 Check it
01:58:16 So so i'm working on a little analysis video. Well, it's it's like a how-to video on a
01:58:24 On a on a very specific stream. Um, do you guys ever watch any of the adult swim live streams?
01:58:29 Back when they would do them. Are those the ones where they pitch cartoon ideas?
01:58:33 Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah, that's one specifically i'm talking about. Okay. There's a stream called development meeting
01:58:39 And it's legit hosted by the
01:58:41 The head directors of development at adult swim like they're the hosts these these guys aren't like actors
01:58:46 They're actually the development heads. Yeah, and every thursday you could call in
01:58:51 And a picture idea for a cartoon, right? And i've been watching them for like
01:58:56 They've been doing it for two years and they but they like stop back in december because
01:59:01 all the live streams got like um got cancelled because
01:59:04 You know covet they can't afford to do them anymore. I guess change of ceo blah blah blah
01:59:09 That'd be that being said i've been watching enough of them that i now understand the meta game that how to get a show
01:59:15 Picked up. Oh, and i was gonna make yeah, i i was gonna make a video talking about how to do it
01:59:20 I was originally gonna do it after i tried to pitch villain verse to them as a show
01:59:24 But then he got but then you know stream got cancelled and i couldn't do it on time
01:59:28 So i fucking uh, so i guess now why not now and i mean also i need more cloud anyway
01:59:34 Might get me enough cloud you could be like that guy that told everyone to do community posts on youtube and that drives engagement up
01:59:43 But for like adult swim
01:59:45 Yeah, um my video was gonna be the video was gonna be called something like um how to get your own adult swim show
01:59:51 Oh, perfect, and i i'm already clicking on it was good
01:59:54 Yeah, yeah, the video i only written down like
01:59:57 One fifth of it. I'm not gonna lie. It's been a while since i've seen any of the older streams
02:00:03 Of it, so i'm gonna probably watch a couple of those while i work on villain versus this next week
02:00:08 um
02:00:10 But yeah
02:00:12 Fuck i'm excited for that
02:00:13 You know that um, you know that pan pizza went on to pitch a show while uh gendi tartikoski was on too as guests
02:00:19 Yes, i heard of this and i heard it was bad
02:00:23 It was it was bad. I was actually i was i actually gave him some like pointers and advice beforehand
02:00:30 Um, i feel kind of bad. I could have given like better like advice, but um
02:00:34 He did he did fumble and it was very it was hilarious not gonna lie pretty on brand he honor
02:00:41 Yeah, it is pretty is very on brand like he on ironic
02:00:44 There was a part where like
02:00:45 Like the thing is that he just was too busy talking about the lore of his world instead of like talking about the actual show
02:00:52 Like like when you go on you have to like specifically they're looking for
02:00:56 They're looking for comedy they're looking for comedy shows
02:00:59 They want comedy shows and they really want you to talk about like the characters and dynamics, right?
02:01:05 If you could go on and describe the dynamic of your characters
02:01:09 Um to to to tell somebody the good dynamic is when like you tell the host
02:01:15 The dynamic and the host could already like figure out like stories with that dynamic. Yeah, right?
02:01:19 That's when you know, you have a good show. Unfortunately. No one gives a fuck about your lore. It's
02:01:25 Yeah, yeah, they gotta make them care surface love
02:01:28 Yeah, I there's there was a whole point that like pan pizza was bringing up with his
02:01:32 With his pitch where it's like, oh, you know in my world, uh, like they banged cartoon and they could have like half human
02:01:39 half cartoon children and
02:01:41 But here's the thing if you actually read his the comic like that literally has nothing to do with the plot
02:01:46 And how okay, which how
02:01:48 How does uh pan pizza's cartoon pitch compared to a mysterious mr. Enter's cartoon pitch
02:01:55 Which one which one's more based?
02:01:58 Here's here's the thing. Uh, this look. I love pan pizza. He's a friend of mine
02:02:02 Um, that that being said I could see I could miss fruit
02:02:07 Through full force of will I could probably see mr. Mr. Enter getting at least some
02:02:13 Not not getting an actual show on a network, but actually getting like a pilot
02:02:17 done
02:02:21 Like maybe before pan because like at least mr. With mr. Enter
02:02:24 It's kind of like he's just like at this point. He admits it's a terrible idea, but he's still gonna do it
02:02:34 Yeah, like he he admitted that like, oh, yeah, this is gonna make no money at all. I'm still gonna do this pilot
02:02:40 What a fucking idiot. It's like god. No, that's
02:02:43 Idiot
02:02:47 It's this weird kind of like
02:02:49 Throw your fucking baby right out with that bath water and get a new baby and new bath water
02:02:53 I don't know like when like there's something interesting about like when someone has an incredibly
02:02:58 Bad story or something but still wants to go through with it. Like oh my god
02:03:02 Like this this probably means something more to them than people realize
02:03:06 No, I don't want to know which one is going to get made. I want to know which one was better
02:03:09 Oh, well, like I mean it's different because mr. Enter didn't go on like the development meaning to pitch it
02:03:15 Um, we have a lot to go on with pans. Anyway, no different versions of the same story
02:03:21 Uh, yeah, pan just keeps soft rebooting it. But the the general gist is that um
02:03:26 Uh, I think pans has a stronger
02:03:29 Premise it the thing is that I think the premise is very good with pans thing
02:03:33 The problem is that like the characters don't have a strong dynamic because it's like
02:03:38 Oh, there's like a little like pan described this character that had a bunch of assholes
02:03:42 But if you read the comic, it's like they're not really assholes. They're just kind of like regular people
02:03:47 Maybe if like one maybe if one was a piece of shit and one was a straight man
02:03:51 It'd be a lot better of a dynamic, but it's not they're very like I don't know. They're very normal
02:03:57 Um
02:03:59 Well, I'll gonna I'll say this right now. I'm definitely not going to go and read pan pizzas cartoon pitch treatment
02:04:07 I don't know
02:04:10 It's on a it's on a stream you could um
02:04:12 You could watch actually I'll link it right now
02:04:14 I can't like I can barely watch that like that toy story. Let's play
02:04:19 I can't watch like him like bombing live in front of industry veterans
02:04:26 Oh, wait, wait, wait, you get to see him like do a pitch live
02:04:29 Yeah, it's like a live stream. They did not hear me. Okay. That's a little interesting
02:04:33 Adult swim hosts like a live stream where they just get on like random. Okay, cool. I here's a link with it timestamp
02:04:40 Um, it this is when pan pizza jumps in and he starts pitching it and it's like, oh my god, this guy fumbles oof
02:04:48 And um, it's so funny because like at the end after he gets off
02:04:52 Uh, gendi tarakoski is on the stream to as guest hosts also mike laszlo
02:04:57 former c
02:04:58 It's lasso from camp lasso
02:05:01 Mike lasso, I mean
02:05:04 Mike lasso and who's the former CEO right former
02:05:08 CEO adult swim. Yeah, and um, and the thing is after pan pizza leaves, um, again
02:05:13 He said something very interesting about his pitch like he says like
02:05:17 um, the problem with like pan pizza's pitch was that
02:05:20 Um, it's like it's like if you're trying to sell someone on finding on finding Nemo and you tell them it's about the ocean
02:05:27 I see, you know what that in a way, maybe it's good. He bond because that's really that's
02:05:35 Uh, that's pretty profound
02:05:38 Yeah, that's uh, that's I know exactly what that means
02:05:42 Yes, I have lots of insight. Hmm quite
02:05:45 I get it. I get it though
02:05:47 So you're so as you're saying that pan was like focused on like the setting and the premise but not on like the story of it
02:05:54 Right. Yeah, like he like I've talked to pans. I've been in like I I actually been helping him a lot with uh
02:06:00 this
02:06:01 With the comic as much as like as much as I can to the point where like if I do more than what I do
02:06:06 He's gonna have to start like paying me or put me on as a co-writer or or that would be just terrible
02:06:12 Put more critiques and capitalism in and then maybe I'll keep doing it for free
02:06:16 Yeah, exactly. Um, no, but um, no actually
02:06:20 I wonder if you can pay me in price. I already told other people actually
02:06:25 I actually asked pan like look
02:06:27 I actually asked pan like look
02:06:28 I could probably help you like really rough out the story a lot more if you put me on as co-writer or something
02:06:34 Because like at this point it's like too the stuff I'm doing the stuff I would suggest
02:06:38 Would just be too much that it's like to put in this much effort. I would need something in return
02:06:43 Right and I and I asked him about that and he's and he's not like, I don't know
02:06:48 It wasn't down, but whatever
02:06:50 Yeah, I already got my own comics
02:06:52 um
02:06:54 So wait, can I I can I just say can I say that pan pizza is not a good artist?
02:07:00 damn
02:07:02 I like his art. I don't
02:07:04 I I don't even know what it is. Pan pizzas are pan pizzas artists like yours, but worse cheesy like yours, but like way worse
02:07:12 I don't know if I agree
02:07:14 Is art kind of reminds me of uh wonder waffle and I like wonder waffles like uh, it's worse than that too
02:07:20 Oh, no, no, and I'm talking shit about my boy wonder waffle. I mean, I don't I mean, I'm pretty neutral on wonder waffle
02:07:28 Hold up. I'll show you some of wonder this development meeting thing. Yeah, is this something anyone can do?
02:07:34 Um, not anymore because the stream is over, but yeah, anyone could do anyone could jump on and pitch their idea
02:07:40 Are they starting it up again?
02:07:43 Uh, hopefully
02:07:45 But there has been no word about it. They do in the last episode they mentioned that they would be so down to come back
02:07:52 But at this point, I don't think they can afford to do the live streams
02:07:55 Uh, wait a second. Here's here's wonder waffles art
02:07:59 Uh, and I think it's really good
02:08:01 Yeah, that's pretty good
02:08:03 I don't I don't I feel like
02:08:07 I feel like pan pizzas art
02:08:09 Is probably like if he wants to do comics, he's gonna have to like rearrange the art a little bit better
02:08:16 But um, you mean he looks like he's drawing
02:08:19 For animation, but he's not
02:08:23 And it's it's bad. I think he majored in uh, I think he majored in
02:08:27 Graphic designing or something. These are made these look like they're made to be flash puppets, but they're not
02:08:32 I I google pan pizza and it is images of pizza
02:08:37 A rebel rebel taxi pan pizza
02:08:41 Because the channel is called the rebel tag. Look at this. I'm looking at the stream. I'm looking at the
02:08:48 I'm looking at the pitch document images. I'm sorry. These are garbage
02:08:51 These are garbage. They're trash. I think my biggest issue with pans art isn't the quality of the art itself
02:08:58 It's that it's the thing cheesy said is that like it's kind of hard to tell what's happening with his characters
02:09:04 I I can't I can't get over the quality of the art. That's honestly, that's it. That's that's all that's all I need to see
02:09:10 I'm not even gonna think about it any further
02:09:13 I'm mad. I'm actually mad
02:09:18 You know, you know me like I like the majority of artists. I don't think there's any artists. I this means you have no standards
02:09:25 Wow, okay. That's like that's like you're like the jake. You're like the jake english with movies

02:11:12 Yeah, uh, oh well
02:11:14 Oh, well
02:11:15 Oh, well
02:11:16 So anyway, I'm working on it. I'm working on analysis video talking about how to win at
02:11:21 Making a pitch like what's like the killer things you need to do to to get
02:11:26 How to game
02:11:29 I don't know but here's the thing here's that's going to be like the end joke like at the end
02:11:33 It's going to be like, oh you ready to do your pitch now. Well too bad. It's canceled. You can't do it. It's too late
02:11:42 Owned
02:11:43 Classic cheesy tricking people
02:11:45 Tricking people to watching my content and then at the very end I'd be like
02:11:50 It's canceled now villain versus never going to be a show
02:11:53 And that's how I sneak in the little the little ad
02:11:58 Sneak it in. Yeah, you know a little
02:12:02 Never happen all because wink
02:12:06 Wake villain first. What's that?
02:12:10 Oh
02:12:12 I don't think you need to sneak it in. I think it's better if you just say also read my comic you fuck
02:12:17 You just say that
02:12:19 Okay, I'll do that
02:12:23 If you sneak it in it seems like you got something to hide
02:12:25 So I'm a sneaky guy. I'm a I'm a
02:12:28 I might you might call me a villain if you will. I'm a sneaky little villain. I sink in my ad
02:12:33 You might be calling a villain a verse
02:12:36 I'm a verse to
02:12:39 Here's my verse on villainy if you will an unverse they call you might call me a stinky little piece of shit
02:12:45 You know a villain
02:12:48 Oh god
02:12:51 I was looking at my comic lord of ghosts and I was like, oh, this is pretty good. How many um chapters are there a lot of ghosts?
02:12:59 Uh
02:13:01 The chapters
02:13:03 Let me five I think give and take dot site
02:13:07 Click that in click that in right now everybody. All right. I'll do play along. All right. Uh, given given date
02:13:14 Given date dot site
02:13:17 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah wrong
02:13:19 Um
02:13:21 Given take trans is the first thing on uh google six seven seven chapters and 94 pages so far
02:13:32 Tell me on the lord of ghosts. Why should I read it?
02:13:36 Um, the lord of ghosts is about a ghostly person who is uh
02:13:43 He's so fucking quirky though
02:13:46 um
02:13:48 He right there's a world that's uh
02:13:51 There's slime and there's no no you're talking about the ocean. You're talking about the ocean. Don't talk about the ocean
02:13:56 Um, don't uh, can you go for an episode of the lord of ghosts?
02:14:02 Can I go for an episode? Yes
02:14:05 I don't know what that means never never mind. It's a bit. Okay
02:14:09 Yeah, last you're logic. You're sorry. That's it. You're five minutes are over
02:14:14 Doesn't make grammatical sense what that's you are the weakest
02:14:18 Give when you pitch when you pitch when you pitch you gotta gotta go in with the log line
02:14:23 You gotta give the log line. You gotta talk about the dynamic. I know that if you said give me the log line
02:14:27 I would have known what okay. Give me the talking about
02:14:31 Oh lord of ghosts is a ghost trying to remember his past and and uh, he's uh swept up in lots of
02:14:39 Little adventures and he's he just wants people to be dead. He just wants people to be dead and that's so much to us
02:14:46 That's good. That's good. Okay. He what is there like a
02:14:49 No, he wants everyone to be dead like him. That's good. What what's the stakes?
02:14:52 What's the stakes in the lord of ghosts?
02:14:55 Um through the heart he's gonna he's gotta
02:14:58 He's gotta is a little ghost gotta find his way home little ghost gotta find his way home
02:15:02 You're in okay, so a little ghost gotta find his way home and also make sure everyone's dead
02:15:06 Yeah
02:15:08 Yeah, the most the most we could give you is 10 seasons. You think that's gonna be enough to tell the story
02:15:13 Uh, I'll have to no deal have to cut out. I have to cut out some of the uh, some filler have to cut out some of my
02:15:20 My my bonus content, but
02:15:24 Ten seasons lord of ghosts lord of ghosts is a one season long anime squeezed into 10 seasons
02:15:31 Just like the hobbit movies
02:15:33 Yeah
02:15:35 Was it the battle of the 500 000 armies?
02:15:41 I can't I want to do a lot of armies fighting each other
02:15:46 Like five armies. That's kind of like a lot of
02:15:50 How do you even fit that many armies in one battle?
02:15:53 Oh, because they're all hobbits. That's why because they're small enough. Oh, they're all hobbits. I thought they could have five armies
02:16:00 Makes sense. Yeah, five armies is is fine. But you know, if the if they're made of small people that makes them
02:16:08 One hobbit one human is like three hobbits, right? So you can have like five armies. Yeah. Yeah
02:16:23 Anyway, go read lord of ghosts on gibbon take dot site. Yeah, I agree. There's my pitch
02:16:29 I I I want to get back to to finishing it because it sort of ends right now on a cliffhanger
02:16:34 There was supposed to be something that happens afterwards, but it's changed in my mind since then I need to rewrite it
02:16:44 Just recently I dropped
02:16:46 it's been
02:16:47 A year and I and I dropped another
02:16:50 comic on bongo and luna on webtoons
02:16:52 But this comic was talking about how like hey, I'll bring back bongo and luna if my patreon reaches the 200 dollars
02:17:00 And um, it has not but it did reach to 100 finally
02:17:04 That's pretty good. Yeah. Yeah, uh, but apart bongo and luna should become
02:17:09 Like a political platform. They should talk exclusively about how capitalism is fucking stupid. I just I just might
02:17:17 Yeah, yeah, they should they should be one of those
02:17:20 cartoonist
02:17:21 Like bread panels. Yeah, bread. Yeah bread
02:17:25 Bread a bread tuner. Yeah, bongo luna is already bad. So I just got to add the politics and it won't change. It won't change
02:17:31 It won't change at all
02:17:34 Should be like
02:17:35 Luna stop squeezing my tits instead. We got to squeeze these greedy capitalists out of all their money
02:17:41 You gotta squeeze we gotta squeeze the short on game stop luna
02:17:44 Uh
02:17:46 Luna stop looking at my ass instead. We gotta look at the crimes that the
02:17:51 And start and start looking at these green candles on the wall street exchange
02:17:57 dude
02:17:58 Something really funny about like the exact same way of like hey
02:18:04 Stop looking at my ass stop looking at my tits like every single comic exactly starts the same way
02:18:09 Like entirely sexual. It's like instead of that. How about this political idea like cutting all of the like the nuance and the
02:18:17 Subtiffusion, you know the sleight of hand out of it. It's just like power one sex panel two politics
02:18:23 Luna stop jerking off. We got to get rid of these jerks off of wall street
02:18:29 Yeah, I ironically do that. That would be really
02:18:32 Luna stop looking at my ass remember how bill clinton bombed that that pharmaceuticals plant in syria
02:18:40 Whatever reminds me of there is a comic like like that
02:18:43 I think where it's like this one girl
02:18:45 Like the first panel would be like a guy is being like like hey, hey, baby
02:18:49 You want to suck my dick and then the girl like kills them and that's like every comic
02:18:54 It's just like she does she like violently murder. Yeah. Yeah. It's so funny. I think I've seen that
02:18:58 I think my my favorite one is like where she's like in the first panel
02:19:01 She's hanging out with like a guy friend and this guy called a race car johnny
02:19:07 Like in the in the first panel and then and then she's all like all right
02:19:10 That was a that was a great dinner guys
02:19:12 I'll see you guys later and then race and then the the male character like shakes race cars johnny's hand
02:19:18 And then hugs the girl and then the girl says hey, wait a second
02:19:21 Did you did you shake his hand because he's a guy and hugged me because i'm a girl and the guys and the male
02:19:26 The male friend's like uh, uh and in the third panel she like punches him
02:19:30 But then race car race car johnny's like right there too and all race car johnny says is room room
02:19:36 room room
02:19:41 Do you guys think it's time?
02:19:44 I love you guys think it's time to go to voicemails speaking of messages
02:19:49 Or is it?
02:19:51 Well, I guess you're right
02:19:53 I think it's time to go to voicemail. Yeah tectonic. I think you're right us us hoes should go to the voicemails now
02:20:01 All right, sirs. I have prepared I have prepared the voicemails for your pleasure
02:20:06 Thank you. Thank you
02:20:09 Thank you. How's the pleasure rule about this? Okay, so
02:20:14 All right first
02:20:16 Okay, disavow so
02:20:19 first voicemail is called uh
02:20:22 to to me j
02:20:24 Toom toom j y
02:20:26 The best channel on youtube
02:20:29 three two one
02:20:31 Go i'm here to shout out the absolute number one best youtube channel
02:20:36 on the entire website
02:20:39 um
02:20:40 That is david razi
02:20:42 Uh, he he has about 24 000 subscribers. So of course he should have more
02:20:48 um, so what he does
02:20:51 is say a
02:20:52 long-running narrative
02:20:55 animatic
02:20:56 Which isn't an animation. It's like a a comic or a storyboard, but uh, narrated
02:21:04 You know
02:21:05 What he does the story
02:21:08 Is about him the creator
02:21:11 In college in art school not having any fucking idea what he's doing with his life
02:21:17 Or why he is there and it's about you know
02:21:21 Motivating yourself in like a post jesus society
02:21:26 You know what the fuck uh finding your purpose or whatever
02:21:31 Uh, it's great is full of pathos pathos
02:21:36 It's a long-running narrative
02:21:38 um
02:21:39 so, you know
02:21:41 You can start with the first episode or there's one about uh working at walmart. It's great
02:21:48 And it can be a good place to like you know meet the character get familiar with the feel
02:21:53 Which is uh number 19 called where you're going uh watch it
02:21:58 I think i've seen this before
02:22:01 So he just somewhere he just this is a really kind of cool channel idea. He just shows on the youtube channel
02:22:08 No, wait, so this is um
02:22:11 Is it like
02:22:12 inspirational content?
02:22:14 If he is he could be doing way better. Is it like inspirational stuff? Is it like just bio comics basically?
02:22:20 Yeah, autobi. He's the original story time animator says his twitter profile. So yeah, it's it's like the story time
02:22:28 YouTube videos, but it seems like it seems like obviously this guy was doing it for fucking longest years ago
02:22:34 2013 I think
02:22:38 This is pretty cool honestly that voicemail. However
02:22:42 Needed more lo-fi hip-hop and editing
02:22:46 His last technical day of episode was three weeks ago, huh?
02:22:50 I don't know. I hate autobiocomics on principle. So I think yeah
02:22:55 Yeah
02:22:58 Isn't isn't one of your comics? Yeah, I never made another one
02:23:01 Um, is it like vapors kind of autobi?
02:23:05 No
02:23:08 This is veneer. That's right. That's what yes
02:23:11 Is at least at least have the day had the decency to pretend that you're not just writing about yourself. That's what that's all
02:23:18 It's totally not actually
02:23:21 All fiction isn't always like always just about the author. Yeah, first of all, Vincent is white. Okay, so there
02:23:28 That should be the dead giveaway. That's it's literally not me
02:23:32 um
02:23:34 Okay, okay, so
02:23:36 Next one is called is another is tommy j. What the fuck is an LLC?
02:23:41 three two one
02:23:43 go
02:23:44 Does anybody know like
02:23:47 Where corporations even came from like where we got this idea that an organization
02:23:55 became like a person
02:23:57 Like a legal person
02:24:00 How does nobody like they must have done this on purpose, right?
02:24:04 Like I don't see how you couldn't foresee this as soon as you made something like this
02:24:10 The people who made it who made the fucking the corporation
02:24:14 They're literally called limited liability companies or some shit like it's like
02:24:19 Created specifically the entire concept is just that whenever anything goes wrong
02:24:24 Whenever your pollution like kills a bunch of children or something you just disappear
02:24:29 You just resign you jump ship
02:24:32 and pass all the bullshit on
02:24:35 to your
02:24:37 Your your the shareholders who don't see a company coming. We're probably like
02:24:42 LLCs are probably massive investors from the middle class and
02:24:47 You pass it on to your employees and you pass it on to your customers and let them deal with the bullshit, you know
02:24:54 How yeah for real how or just you know
02:24:58 The shit you cause just never gets resolved and the victims just just just sit there
02:25:03 Be poisoned or whatever
02:25:06 I give welcome back. Why how?
02:25:09 It's it's cancer kill it kill corporations
02:25:13 That was that was a great voicemail. Uh, next one up is uh, Tommy jay. What the fuck?
02:25:18 What the fuck is an what the fuck is an LLC part two?
02:25:21 Jesus Christ
02:25:23 Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Not this one. Not this one. Uh, it is
02:25:28 Yeah, what the fuck is an LLC part two? Uh, three two one go
02:25:33 Honestly, the worst part maybe I don't know. There's lots of bad
02:25:37 A bad part is it I hope you guys are ready?
02:25:39 I hope you guys are ready for what the fuck is an LLC part three after this and none of the ways that are like
02:25:45 A detriment to being a person like if an american person
02:25:51 Went over to china and just like kidnapped a person a chinese person
02:25:58 And just forced them to put together plastic crap for them until they wanted to kill themselves and jumped out a window
02:26:04 And landed in a suicide nest net then like when that person got back to the u.s
02:26:10 They'd be extradited to china and then face consequences for that shit that they did
02:26:16 But a corporation just gets to use magical bullshit
02:26:20 You know what? I like legally nonsense to avoid those those repercussions
02:26:26 You know, it's it's bad. It's honestly. This is very basic shit with power
02:26:33 Maybe if comes responsibility with right comes the responsibility for the shit that you do
02:26:38 I'm going to kill you. Um, how how the thing is that it's in the name. It's a limited life
02:26:44 So the liability is limited so they can't get in trouble. Here we go
02:26:49 Limited my ability makes you think
02:26:53 Make really really does really does make thank you the voicemail. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but look at this
02:26:59 Look at look at this image and tell me that this is okay
02:27:02 This is fine. Dude. It's wait. Yes. Yes. That's like that was in the pitch. That was in the pitch
02:27:10 Oh, I don't like that. I don't like it either very hound. What is this is a picture? This is a picture reference
02:27:16 Why do white girls always want to fuck dogs? Oh my god, it is
02:27:23 Oh wait, you're a white girl and I know it's hard, but you gotta stop banging dogs
02:27:32 You guys know that song? Hold up. You can rely on the white man's come. You can oh, that was a song created
02:27:39 That was a song created by like, uh, my my friend a yellow swag. He made he made this song about white girls. Hold up
02:27:47 I only oh mr. Yellow
02:27:49 I love this guy. I interviewed him on a couple cheesy counts ago. Oh, oh, I know this guy. Yeah on twitter
02:27:56 Yeah, he's cool. Love him
02:27:59 um
02:28:02 Hey, tell whoever that is in the background a shout out
02:28:05 It's a dog. Um
02:28:07 Oh, okay. Next one is uh, tommy j. What the fuck is an llc part three? Oh my god. I'm gonna talk over this
02:28:13 Three two the thrilling conclusions three two one go
02:28:19 Okay, so while this goes i'm just going to find more, uh screenshots of terrible pan pizza art
02:28:24 Uh to prove my point and if a if a corporation is a person
02:28:29 I did
02:28:31 The income tax rate that like a person actually gonna you know, he has a podcast called a special tax rate that
02:28:38 I think it's lower, right? I'm can't I can't hear you over tommy. It's awesome. I have to declare war
02:28:43 I'm interested in what he has to say to us or whatever
02:28:47 deductible what if tommy j is actually saying very
02:28:50 Profound things about the concept. He might be a real person, but his presentation is very dull for me
02:28:56 That i'm not interested. I'm sorry tommy j. It's all it's all wrong. Nothing against you. I think it might I probably agree with you
02:29:03 Everything I'm always gonna tell you this right now. I probably agree with everything you have to say
02:29:07 except indie games
02:29:09 And like dudes on pay but patreon is bullshit. So even the dudes on on patreon are
02:29:16 Like knee deep in the bullshit. They're not making the bullshit, but they're in it. Does pan have a
02:29:22 They're on a foundation
02:29:24 Probably be able to put something together with like a fucking public bitcoin
02:29:31 I don't know what i'm fucking talking about. I just know it's all bullshit. It's all okay. I found the trouble
02:29:37 It's all a lie
02:29:40 It's been talked on this podcast of like investing
02:29:44 in
02:29:45 These in these these mutual funds. Okay, look at this
02:29:49 Um
02:29:50 Look at this. I don't know
02:29:52 The money's not real. So who cares it looks like a smear frame drawings aren't real
02:29:58 That looks like a like a murdoch from gorillas smear frame. This is like this is like
02:30:04 I don't know this I can see he's going for like a for like a fairly odd parents like very graphic designy look
02:30:10 But like it's just shit. I don't know like he just failed at it
02:30:13 I did
02:30:14 How is it that butch Hartman's art has like regressed
02:30:18 Over the years because like dany phantom and fairly odd parents the guy who does
02:30:22 But then you see him draw the characters now the thing is that he didn't even really design those cartoons
02:30:27 It was uh, steven silver. I know he wasn't really big on dany phantom
02:30:31 Like a big part of it
02:30:33 So that was me. I'm really pitchy pitch dany phantom. I assume he drew the original cosmon wand
02:30:39 Yeah, he um, he pitched dany phantom and fairly odd parents
02:30:43 um
02:30:45 I just remember reading that that uh, someone else whose name I obviously don't remember. So that's that's the guy who is
02:30:51 That's the guy's style and he's he's also the guy behind other kim possible
02:30:56 Oh, that's shit. That makes sense. Yeah, he sounds like a cool dude. Um, I like butch Hartman
02:31:02 Is more of a rude dude
02:31:06 It's could be worse could be junkay. Okay
02:31:09 Uh, dude instead of that look at look at one of my favorite pages from the lord of ghosts
02:31:14 Wait, oh, this is a cool page. I like this
02:31:17 I don't even wait. I don't even remember this one to slime city. It's very near the end. Yeah, haunt haunt dude. I love this
02:31:26 Oh, this is so fucking cool. I got it. The lord of ghosts is so good
02:31:31 Makes me happy
02:31:33 Yeah, but I think um
02:31:35 I think it's just a draw more comics and I'm not talking necessarily like
02:31:39 Loki rl like you need to better
02:31:42 understanding of like
02:31:45 Images within panels you get me. I guess cinematography panel
02:31:55 Are you still looking I mean are you still looking man? Yeah. Yeah, I'm still I'm just going through his tumblr and like
02:32:01 some of these are okay
02:32:03 I would say his art range is from okay to bad
02:32:07 I
02:32:10 I want to say I want to say that I
02:32:12 I like yeah, I think it's fine. It's just that it might not be the best
02:32:15 For a comic or to do a comic consistently. It does take him like a couple of months to do at least one
02:32:21 issue
02:32:22 Then again, I think that's a majority of people
02:32:25 I I think that his art
02:32:27 would look better
02:32:29 in like an
02:32:32 It's like he's drawing for animation, but he's not so it just looks like shit
02:32:36 That's that's what I think doesn't work about it. I'm trying to remember. I don't well. No, there's more to it than that
02:32:41 I just think he has like a shit like um
02:32:43 sensibility of like what looks cool
02:32:45 Uh in in addition to his like misguided
02:32:49 It's just misguided uh, uh, uh, you know technique in general
02:32:54 Individual lines look pretty good, but the the whole okay doesn't really work. What is this?
02:33:01 Like what what is this on the right?
02:33:06 That's uh that one chick from myzakin
02:33:09 Yes, I know but it's it's garbage
02:33:11 an idiot
02:33:13 Yes, it's like uh, you know, I think I think
02:33:18 I can tell that he's going for he's just sort of failed on on like capturing the
02:33:23 like
02:33:24 It just sort of feels like she she's melting
02:33:27 Like it's it's going for like why I know it's I know it's going for a squash and stretch
02:33:31 It's going for a squash and stretch, but it doesn't look good. There's like uh, it's not just design is a word
02:33:37 There's like a full style. There's like a philosophy thing, but he's going like half measure. It's not like it's
02:33:43 Stylistic enough to feel like it's deliberate. It feels like he just fucked up
02:33:47 It is feel like it's half it's half measured. Okay. What really pisses
02:33:50 Okay, the line of action like look at the arms like the the the arm behind the body
02:33:56 The arm behind the body
02:33:58 Like it's like curving in in like the same direction. I just noticed. Yeah, like the way the arms are positioned is very strange
02:34:05 Like I can tell he did he drew it as like a it's got like this
02:34:10 It's like an over adherence to like the line of action like if you look at the silhouette
02:34:14 It just looks like it's like a blob that sort of curves from the left to the right
02:34:18 And like the arm follows that line, but it doesn't actually look right
02:34:21 It it's it's like he's trying to okay. Wait hold up. You guys ever seen this. This is like uh
02:34:26 Yeah, this for the cartoon one over yonder and it's kind of like lava theory
02:34:31 It sounds like a spongebob video
02:34:33 It's like how kind of like certain shapes of characters like
02:34:36 Fill into each other when they're standing next to each other and I feel like pan is trying to do something
02:34:41 Similar, but a lot a lot of times it feels like a lot of the lines
02:34:45 Contradict each other almost. Oh, you got me. I got I found another one
02:34:49 God, I found another one
02:34:52 I like the machete drawing. I think that one's pretty. Yeah, the machete one's okay. And the the bionicle is okay
02:34:58 Oh, that one this one's old this this comic is like this is like the probably look at that hand second or third incarnation
02:35:05 Okay, I mean this is from this is 11 months ago. He posted this 11 months ago
02:35:11 I think this is a repost maybe okay, maybe whatever. Well, it looks terrible
02:35:17 All right, if it's if it's not representative of his style then fine, but I think it is
02:35:22 It's it's whatever, you know, okay, you know what?
02:35:26 Um, how about how about we all cool our heads as we listen to tommy j. What the fuck is anything?

02:37:21 Was empathetic the other week in the first voicemail. I said because I cringed at him losing bitcoin
02:37:27 I would like to think I'm an empathetic person. Anyway today
02:37:31 What this week what I cringed that
02:37:33 Is the fact that I have to go get a covid test because my mom got covid
02:37:39 She's gonna be okay. She's recovering
02:37:42 But she was very sick and now I have to go get a test
02:37:46 See if I'm sick because I live with her. So that's gonna be fun. I have to get the long thing up my nose
02:37:51 I'm not excited about it. Oh
02:37:53 Um, but I'll be okay. I'll survive
02:37:57 Um, what I bing would you bing? What do you bing this week was um
02:38:04 I binged uh, I binged some episodes of avatar the last year, but I'm not familiar with this one
02:38:10 I listened to the podcast at work and they shut up. I'm trying to listen to cringis bingus
02:38:15 Uh, but some of those early episodes are kind of are kind of silly cartoony
02:38:19 But it's a good show still I think I like it
02:38:23 Uh, cringis bingus signing off. Goodbye. I'll see you next week
02:38:26 Cringis
02:38:29 Wait, wait, wait, wait, cringis cringis if you're listening to this right now
02:38:33 I want your opinion on the pan peaks of art style
02:38:36 Yes, absolutely. Please. Cringis bing
02:38:39 Cringis call next time and tell us your opinion on pan peaks of art style. I'm really interested
02:38:45 What show did he say he binged?
02:38:49 I'm sorry, Ben. I wasn't listening. Fuck all of you. I'm going back. I'm listening again
02:38:54 All right, we'll wait on you. Thank you to do that when I bing
02:38:59 It was the early episodes of avatar. Oh my god, shut up. I'm trying to fucking listen die
02:39:08 It was avatar the last airbender lol fucking christ
02:39:13 He is right though. The early episodes are kind of I wouldn't say they're cring, but they are but
02:39:19 But they're they're definitely rough
02:39:21 Uh, or just like they're definitely he's right. Um, like average kids show
02:39:26 I'm sorry for my internet keeps clicking out. That's pretty cringy. Wait, uh, what's I mean?
02:39:32 What's wrong with the early avatar episodes? I haven't watched it. There's nothing specifically wrong with with them
02:39:38 But they're not indicative of the quality. They are, um, unassuming. I think yeah, but I don't know whether that's a like
02:39:45 Like ultimately makes them good because they're unassuming and you you get a it's like, oh, it's just a fun adventure
02:39:51 And then it grows and grows. Maybe that is an aspect of it that works
02:39:55 There some of the episodes though are just like are just bad like, uh
02:39:59 Like bato of the water tribe that one is is just like not a good episode and like everyone gets in the great divide
02:40:06 uh, bato of the water tribe is the one where
02:40:08 um, ang finds out that uh, that
02:40:12 uh, uh, katara and sakka's dad is going to be, uh, nearby
02:40:17 And uh, he withholds the information because he's jealous
02:40:22 And uh, hijinks ensue
02:40:25 Ang is jealous that they have a dad
02:40:28 That that he won't be paying attention
02:40:32 Yeah, um
02:40:34 I think there were a couple of different writers in the early seasons. I
02:40:37 I'll of but uh, erine has took
02:40:39 One one that I remember
02:40:42 Finding annoying for some reason was jet and I don't know why because I thought jet was cool initially
02:40:48 Jet is like the the
02:40:51 I don't I like that episode because jet is a character jet is like the the typical like based but actually cringe character
02:41:00 He's so he's so typical. Oh, yeah, I remember this guy
02:41:05 Because he's he's based because you know, he has like a stick in his mouth and he wants he wants to free
02:41:12 Like he's he's cool. Katara gets a lady bono for him. Yeah, it turns out he uh
02:41:17 Is cringe kind of cring at he's kind of cring. He's kind of cring anyone and he just kind of wants to kill people
02:41:24 Uh, he is a good. Oh, that's that's pretty base. I don't know what you guys it's a
02:41:29 You know, it comes and goes
02:41:33 Um, he has a good art scene. I've never seen avatar the last ever. He's only in one episode, right?
02:41:39 He's in he comes back
02:41:41 Uh, uh, very very briefly for like a a uh, like a couple episodes point into the earth's kingdom
02:41:48 Like I remember he uh, he's trying to be oh, yeah, he gets some he gets taken in by the uh, the uh
02:41:57 The diely who like brainwash him and then he comes back and it's like a bit of a whoa
02:42:01 And he you've totally changed literally
02:42:07 He tries to be based and he just he can't help it. He's just constantly cringe
02:42:12 I okay, okay next voicemail next voicemail. It's called it's called enough of this avatar horseshit. Thank you for the voicemail

02:43:03 Oh
02:43:04 Crane crane crane crane
02:43:06 That is pretty cringey. This is cringle, dude
02:43:09 Yeah, it's not us. It's not a situation of throwing stuff at the wall until it sticks
02:43:14 We go through all the voicemails. So if you put or or we don't spam it, we're not gonna pay attention
02:43:19 Or we don't in situations like this
02:43:22 Uh, yeah, specifically because the spam
02:43:25 Don't ever put me in a situation
02:43:28 Uh, all right. What is that one is called?
02:43:31 I don't know. I just forget about it
02:43:33 I saw a funny I saw a funny picture of a frog with a gun that said don't ever put me in a situation
02:43:40 And I just realized it
02:43:42 um
02:43:45 Thanks what it's called. Hey, that's just a theory a pcp theory. Uh, there it is
02:43:51 three two one go
02:43:53 Hey, so everyone here in the pcp theory crabney community has been talking and we're pretty sure we know what's in the kawasaki scrolls
02:44:01 Ben, can you confirm whether or not the scrolls contain the secret samurai circumcision technique?
02:44:07 Like you just take out your katana
02:44:09 Do one big slash walk past the guy and she their sword and their foreskin just pops off
02:44:15 Are we all right, Ben?
02:44:18 I I don't speak japanese. So I don't know I can't read them. I can't even read them. I don't know
02:44:23 This but I have pictures ben. I'm not sure if like this means I can't read pictures very late
02:44:28 To the whole circumcision like arc is funny or not. I'm I'm the jury's out for me
02:44:36 You know, it's it's been long enough. It's been long enough. I'm no longer mad about it
02:44:41 Yeah, it's been long enough. It's been long enough that I'm not mad about it. So
02:44:44 I can stomach it better. That's my opinion
02:44:48 It's an nostalgia
02:44:50 It's it's yeah, it's just all the good old days of like a month ago
02:44:54 Uh, okay, the next one is called hi ben three two one go
02:45:00 Kringus bingus is not only the hero of the downtrodden that we so desperately need in these trying times
02:45:07 Kringus bingus is a holy warrior
02:45:11 All three sides of the holy trinity
02:45:15 And he needs to be respected as such. I absolutely agree. Can you do that in the pretty voice the father the son and the kringus?
02:45:23 Next next voicemail is called hi ben two three two one go
02:45:40 I think it's an impression
02:45:49 Pretty good impression though
02:45:54 What the fuck were they saying?
02:45:56 That's how you know
02:45:58 I don't know. I don't know
02:46:01 Uh, but all I know is okay. Next one is another tommy j. Uh, what the fuck is a virgin? Uh, no
02:46:07 Uh, next one is uh epic thing that you guys might like mostly tom though
02:46:15 Okay, here we go
02:46:17 There it is three two one go found this cool thing
02:46:21 I think you guys might like uh mostly tom, but also everyone else might be interested in it
02:46:27 Um
02:46:28 It's called pico eight. It's like, you know how emulators they'll run like an nes or a game boy bands whatever
02:46:34 This is an emulator for a console that doesn't exist
02:46:37 You can go to the website. Just look up pico eight p i c o eight
02:46:41 And uh, and you can play games there that people have made, uh, you know the game celeste. It was actually prototyped in pico eight
02:46:49 Um like the the creators the the original version of it was in there and then they made it like a full epic game
02:46:54 You know swag mode. Um, but
02:46:58 It's really restrictive. It's like 128 by 128 resolution. There's only 16 colors you can pick from
02:47:04 And it's like 36 32 kilobytes something like that
02:47:08 Okay, why a little bit lesser than an nes, but like not like Atari levels of shit
02:47:12 Well, why make a game for pico eight? It's pretty awesome people make some cool games where and there's even
02:47:18 You can look up hashtag tweet cart on twitter people make the idea
02:47:22 Is that is that you you work it in like a maker?
02:47:26 And they'll post it on twitter and they'll post like the entire code
02:47:29 Uh, I remember no no
02:47:30 They're in the sweet limit like the 280 characters or whatever about this thing. Uh, so you can check all that out. It seems pretty cool
02:47:37 Um, but obviously it's cool. I thought it was cool. That's why I made this voicemail
02:47:44 Uh, okay. Oh, okay, so the idea is like
02:47:49 Get back the like the limits of of like old like data. Yeah hardware or whatever. I think I think the pico
02:47:56 Did did he mention this in the voicemail that uh that you can
02:47:59 Run this in browser. I'm pretty sure like that's the appeal of the pico. I'm playing it. I'm playing cellist two in browser
02:48:05 Yeah, that's that's the appeal of the uh of the pico eight is that it's like a it it's like a website game boy
02:48:13 It's it's cool
02:48:15 That's pretty cute. That's pretty good voicemail. Thank you
02:48:19 Well, this yeah, this does look pretty rad. I guess I better check it out pico eight
02:48:27 Uh
02:48:29 Lexiloffle
02:48:33 Is a fantasy console for making sharing and playing
02:48:38 Oh, okay

02:48:54 Yeah, okay, let's all check it out later. Uh
02:48:57 Yeah, load it up a game called winterwood for me, which looks kind of
02:49:01 I don't know what it is
02:49:04 Okay, next next voicemail is called. Um
02:49:09 YouTube warning very funny joe boy
02:49:13 Okay, three, two, one go you fucking people are always like oh
02:49:21 I don't want to keep making youtube videos
02:49:25 Well, have you ever considered giving thought to starting to initiate the creation of videos for p2p?
02:49:35 Yeah
02:49:37 No, I'm not going to stop sending these I won't stop. You can't fucking
02:49:44 I kind of ruin it
02:49:47 Yeah, you should have cut it off after the punchline
02:49:51 Let's continue making video for a poo
02:49:54 There you go. I have actually yes
02:49:57 Yes
02:49:59 YouTube I thought uh next voice
02:50:02 Uh voice grail
02:50:05 No
02:50:07 I'd rather give it to the pico eight. No if if if if if tommy. Yeah, I mean there's an argument there
02:50:14 Next one is okay next. All right. I'm tempted to play the next one. It's another tommy j
02:50:20 But it's called what the fuck is an apology. So I'm thinking. Okay. How long is it? It's 28 seconds. So it's not that bad
02:50:27 All right. All right. We'll give we'll give you we'll give it a shot. We'll give it a shot three two one go
02:50:33 If you do something you kind of get the feeling that you're supposed to apologize for it by convention
02:50:39 Uh, but you don't actually feel sorry about it. Oh should you because that's like lying, right?
02:50:46 Because you say you regret doing it even though you don't or you say you feel bad
02:50:52 No, this isn't what I was hoping. What do you do you lie or do you like this is a good question?
02:50:57 Do the thing you're supposed to is it a good question? I mean what's the answer?
02:51:01 I guess it's fine
02:51:03 um
02:51:04 Oh, what do you think if you threw the lens that he thinks that we should think that he's sorry for sending all these voicemails
02:51:13 Uh, I think it's interesting. I don't I don't think it doesn't make any sense. You're right. It doesn't I don't think that
02:51:19 This is actually about the voicemails
02:51:22 I mean you could you could read that into it if you wanted to I am invoking death of the author
02:51:26 In which yeah, yeah, I sure in which case what this means is that no, he is not sorry
02:51:31 About sending the and so he will suffer. Yes. I I just I just think that
02:51:37 I don't think panpeaks art style is that bad really. I hate you. I hate you. No, I hate it. I hate it
02:51:43 I'm bringing it back, baby. Is that is just not that bad. It's okay at best. It's okay at best and you know when I call something
02:51:48 That's okay at best. I call it bad
02:51:51 Okay, I call it bad
02:51:54 Bad saint
02:51:56 Is like, I don't know. I don't like it when people fake apologize. I don't think
02:52:02 It's something that should be done, but I guess if
02:52:07 if the only
02:52:08 Like result from an apology whether it's fake or not if it's like a just too quell
02:52:15 anger
02:52:16 that is I don't know maybe
02:52:18 Unjustly bubbling over
02:52:21 No, I don't know. It's not it's not as clear cut as like yes or no. I think I mean
02:52:28 I mean if someone is apologizing to me if if someone did something to me
02:52:33 And then and I didn't like it and then they apologize. They came and apologized to me
02:52:39 But the way they were apologizing like I sense like they don't mean this they're lying to me. It would only make me angrier
02:52:46 So sure that in that situation, but like what if I don't know they apologize
02:52:51 They didn't mean it, but you bought it and now you feel better
02:52:55 well, if I
02:52:58 Oh
02:52:59 So is it if you want to
02:53:02 Maintain a relationship with this person. It's best to apologize even if you don't the point is the point is like
02:53:07 What is the purpose of an apology? Is it more for the listener than it is for the speaker?
02:53:14 Oh, I see. Okay. So like is an apology
02:53:17 There so that like an opportunity for you to make amends or is it just like a social gesture designed to like
02:53:24 maintain
02:53:25 a like
02:53:27 You know
02:53:28 relationship
02:53:29 Right, what is an apology a miserable? I would prefer all apologies to be like sincere, but
02:53:35 I don't know like in a perfect world, you know
02:53:37 I mean I honestly I think it's like if you care about the person if you don't really give a shit about them
02:53:43 And you just are like I need this person not to be mad
02:53:46 Then yeah, sure
02:53:47 You can make a fake apology and as long as they buy it it it does what it's supposed to do
02:53:52 But it but it sounds even worse. Well. Yeah. Well, that's what I think
02:53:55 But if you if you do care about them, then like you're doing you're you're disrespecting them and doing something pretty
02:54:01 Pretty nasty to them by like going to them and saying like you're mad about me doing this thing
02:54:07 I'm not sorry, but I'm gonna pretend that I am so you'll stop being mad about it
02:54:11 No, it's pretty bad the way I'm thinking about that
02:54:14 But like it just depends more on like public apologies for like saying the wrong thing
02:54:20 Like I think I don't know
02:54:22 I guess it gets more complicated
02:54:24 If you don't if you don't actually think that you said the wrong that what you said was wrong
02:54:30 Then no, I mean, I think the right thing to do is not apologize for it even if
02:54:35 Everyone's mad and think they want you to like if you really if you really don't think it was wrong
02:54:41 I believe in sticking to your guns. I think that's good. Yeah, I I think that's
02:54:48 It it it most of the times say what is true
02:54:51 But I don't know there's like there's like a tiny bit of like leeway that I'm like unsure about
02:54:56 well, I mean, I mean if like there's a
02:55:00 I mean if someone is like
02:55:02 If someone is like attacking you
02:55:04 Unjustly and like doing harm and you can stop it with an apology even if you don't mean it
02:55:12 Yeah, but in that case it's like a well, I don't I don't actually care what this person that this person sucks
02:55:17 I'll apologize to them just like to make them stop
02:55:20 I don't like them because they're bad, but like
02:55:23 The apology will prevent damage
02:55:26 sure
02:55:27 I I think so there's there's space for that
02:55:31 It's very cynical, but I don't think you're wrong
02:55:35 I mean, I think I think you I think you should you should make an insincere apology when an apology is not actually warranted
02:55:42 But like it needs to be done
02:55:45 Uh, you know
02:55:47 Yeah, yeah
02:55:50 I mean, it's a it's a concession. Okay, uh next one is called
02:55:55 Uh, I'm skipping the next one. Oh, I'm actually I'm skipping the next two. Actually, there's there's two more Tommy J's

02:56:53 Is this that snakes?
02:56:56 I mean
02:56:58 It could be
02:57:02 Remember that week that everyone had voicemails like this and it was scary
02:57:07 That was only like two weeks ago
02:57:09 It feels like it feels like an eternity
02:57:11 I I think they might be referencing this one wasn't creepy. This one wasn't unsettling. It was just like, uh
02:57:18 Just wacky
02:57:21 It just I felt very weird for the sake of being weird
02:57:24 Yeah, I didn't I don't do you remember that video I made like years ago on Gibbon take
02:57:29 Where it was a let's read and I just opened a book and started silently reading the book on camera. Ah, that's good
02:57:36 No, I don't I think that may have been I don't know if they knew about that, but the idea of Gib coin better
02:57:42 Sorry, it's actually titled Gib coin greater than saint con
02:57:47 Uh, so I don't know
02:57:49 Make make make of that what you will
02:57:52 Yikes, you had a typo
02:57:54 Arguments dismantled voice jail voice jail
02:57:59 Your argument is invalid
02:58:01 Next one is called uh squilliam fancieson
02:58:05 three two one go
02:58:07 A couple weeks ago
02:58:09 You guys had on a pcp fan artist who had done a bunch of art for you guys

02:58:24 Oh god, they're taking me away. Please
02:58:26 Oh, I know this guy. I'm
02:58:28 Yeah, I know I I I haven't actually got
02:58:31 I've watched part of the um
02:58:33 The elder scrolls lecture. I think I haven't watched the whole thing. Uh, yeah, he did another
02:58:38 I mean, we've we've got someone who did a
02:58:41 PCP ask lecture on right now. So fuck you squilliam. Uh, we're doing it
02:58:46 Twice even already happened already happened. Yeah, what he did he did squilliam did one on on the elder scrolls
02:58:53 And he did one on was the other one. He's done more than I have
02:58:58 He's done two and the other one was even plays elder scrolls. I'm right. I I mean not me
02:59:04 Which is probably why I would I would probably get more out of that lecture than a player
02:59:08 Yeah, not not I said ben sey the majority the real silent majority. Yeah, true
02:59:15 I believe this. Okay. I believe this is the video
02:59:22 Yes, yes, that's the one
02:59:25 Okay, it's harry sante. The next one is called reacting to let's read
02:59:30 And it is from gibbon tibbon at fibbon.com
02:59:35 So, uh, okay, so sorry about three two
02:59:39 Three two one go and we'll dive into the treasure of the pleasant valley. Yes, this is a video I was talking about frank. Yabi
02:59:50 Old old face
02:59:54 Don't ever watch videos of mine
03:00:01 This is just gonna be
03:00:04 It's still going
03:00:08 Oh my god, that hit me very quickly. Oh my god, wait
03:00:17 That's kind of what I was waiting for
03:00:19 This character's fucking gay
03:00:25 Negroes in it
03:00:28 Oh
03:00:32 Someone's getting canceled. That's what it read. That's what it said
03:00:37 Yeah, this is like getting canceled for reading huck fit in class
03:00:40 It was an old book a lot of a lot of blacks in this one. Oh two
03:00:46 A little too many of you asked me to a black
03:00:49 Wait, what book was it? It's
03:00:52 The treasure pleasant valley
03:00:55 It's like an old like no cover like 1910s sort of
03:00:59 You know book written before stones were invented
03:01:04 Interesting curious and they had the word they they had the n-word like the the the old n-word the negro word
03:01:12 That's a yeah
03:01:14 Yo, I think it's just as bad
03:01:17 No
03:01:19 No, it's fun. I wouldn't say it but I wouldn't call it as bad. You probably shouldn't say it
03:01:24 You probably shouldn't say it. It's not a slur. Don't think it don't say it. It's just an archaic
03:01:29 It's just an archaic term. It's out of fashion. It's an archaic term, but like the
03:01:33 You finally say it if you're gonna say the Spanish word for the color black
03:01:37 The other one is just a slurrified version. No, it's a country in africa
03:01:41 Slurrified the captain. They used to say negro before they said black and now you say poc
03:01:48 You know, it's all it's all good. Oh my god. He's still saying it. Yeah, but the reason the reason the n-word
03:01:53 Um, the more, you know, the colloquial one. Um, it's not a bad word. You shouldn't really say it
03:01:59 Oh my god is because
03:02:01 Is is because of like the connotation it has
03:02:04 Right, it doesn't have any connotation and the the the more
03:02:08 The slavery maybe no, you know, it's not it's not it's not a slave word. It's not a
03:02:14 I uh, it it's it's just it's not it's just too sussable word nowadays to use is that word again suss
03:02:22 Uh, there's yeah, that's the real slur
03:02:26 Wow, wow, wow, uh, uh, big it big it big it
03:02:31 I gotta say the same in the same episode
03:02:34 Christ
03:02:35 What I just don't think I don't think there's like a
03:02:38 I don't know
03:02:41 Like a significant difference between the old n-word and the new n-word for the older room
03:02:46 Yes, there is more okay. Yes, there is no you're an idiot. You're an idiot because all right
03:02:52 Literally both words existed at the same both words were used at the same time and they were different words
03:02:57 They were two different things and one was the correct term and one was the one was them the the slur
03:03:03 One was always bad and the other one was okay
03:03:06 They both could be used as slurs
03:03:09 Said by white people about black people to dehumanize. No, that's not true
03:03:14 That's not true. The the regular one was not a dehumanizing. It was just the word for I mean we call we call
03:03:19 We call them you could say the same thing about calling someone black like oh black is just what you called someone to dehumanize them
03:03:25 No, it's just it's just the word for it. That's that was just okay. Maybe maybe maybe I don't know the history of the word
03:03:31 I just always assumed that it was like Martin Luther King said like a disparaging sort of word because
03:03:37 It was it was like the the words to use but also because black people were so maligned. It was also like
03:03:45 Like I mean they were called in the way that in Europe too, which like didn't have slavery. Oh, yeah, Europe wasn't racist
03:03:52 I'm not I didn't say that
03:03:54 This is so dumb
03:03:57 This is by this by this logic
03:03:58 You could be like like literally anything that you've called that they used to call them is like automatically racist because people
03:04:04 You know, I I agree this conversation is dumb. Let's
03:04:09 I'm furious
03:04:14 I'm not I'm not I'm not budging until I know like I've looked up the definition of the word more like like the history of the word
03:04:20 And and it's use because I may be assuming things but like I know I know how I know how we can settle this
03:04:26 We got to look it up on urban dictionary.com. That's gonna
03:04:34 All right, uh
03:04:37 Wait, where is the next one there it is
03:04:40 Wait, no, it's me. Um
03:04:42 This one is called the real reason why Nate isn't on the pcp hashtag bge exposed
03:04:50 3 2 1 go
03:04:53 This isn't actually like that serious of a thing
03:04:55 It's just so I felt a comfortable saying it before because it's not actually like a major issue or anything
03:04:59 I just wanted to slip it in so everyone's been commenting on like when's Nate coming back
03:05:04 Where's best guy ever etc etc since the whole brad garling house thing and like I hear what you're saying guys
03:05:10 I understand where you're coming from like why isn't Nate back? But here's what you gotta understand everybody right now
03:05:17 Nate doesn't want to come back on the show. He's doing his own stuff. Do not expect him back
03:05:22 He may come back someday or he may not it is up to him and do not count on it
03:05:28 So everybody commenting. Where's the best guy ever?
03:05:33 This is your answer. He's not coming back anytime soon. He has made that explicitly clear
03:05:38 He is going his own way the proud mig towel that he is
03:05:42 This
03:05:43 This guy sent in a voicemail the last time I was on of like a of a nate best guy ever
03:05:50 Yeah, we'll we'll sent in a voicemail the last time I was on of a very similar sounding speech
03:05:55 I just thought that was interesting that they decided to call it again when I'm on
03:06:00 Okay, I'm sorry to beat this. I'm sorry to beat this dead horse, but I'm gonna read this from wikipedia
03:06:05 Okay, this is from wikipedia. Best guy ever is
03:06:08 In the english language negro plural negro is a term historically used to denote persons considered to be of black african heritage
03:06:16 The term can be construed as offensive inoffensive or completely neutral largely depending on the region or country where it is used
03:06:23 So there you go. Okay wikipedia is on my side. We were both
03:06:27 Once again, the white man is correct
03:06:32 I mean, I would still not use it just because the only times I've I've heard it said in like
03:06:38 Modern times is by extreme far-right racists
03:06:42 Who are also boomers? It's a suss word, Ben. It's just a very suss word to use
03:06:47 Okay, but like if it's like it's not it's not bad if you read it from a book
03:06:51 No, it's not bad
03:06:53 I wasn't like saying. Oh, I mean, I wouldn't I wouldn't like call I wouldn't I wouldn't like call someone that I wouldn't like call someone that
03:07:00 To in like, you know
03:07:02 A regular conversation
03:07:04 Like like maybe maybe
03:07:07 Would do maybe the word is like equivalent to using the term african
03:07:11 Which is like just a description descriptive word in in in that case then sure, but like I feel like like
03:07:18 Generally speaking people associate it more with the n word. Maybe just because it begins with the letter n
03:07:23 Is a n word kind of no, it's literally it's literally it's because the slur is just a like bastardization of that word
03:07:31 Which was the like
03:07:33 Yeah, polite word
03:07:35 I mean if you ask like just random people, I feel like they would assume that they carry the same weight even though they may not
03:07:41 They don't words change definition based on the popular opinion
03:07:44 So like I don't know it's very it's very suss like using the word like using the word boy
03:07:48 Like come here boy like that, you know
03:07:53 Fine, I don't what do you even disagreeing with me about oh, fuck you. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, obviously don't just go around like calling people
03:08:00 It's weird. It'd be really weird to do that
03:08:03 Fuck her
03:08:05 I'm gonna try not cancel you
03:08:08 All right. Okay, Ben. Okay. Ashley's ugly. All right. I agree. She's not good
03:08:12 She is she is fucking ugly. She does her lipstick like a fucking idiot
03:08:17 She's not okay. You won. Yeah. Thanks. Good. I win. I all
03:08:23 I don't think you're okay, Ben. Hands aren't so isn't that good. All right. I always win. Okay. I always get my man
03:08:30 Next next voicemail is called uh, not the samurai. Uh, there it is three
03:08:38 One go
03:08:41 First you skip my exciting earnest voicemail series and now you shit on webcomics making almost none
03:08:48 I still remember the emptiness. I felt I'm from my second rereading on one of my favorite webcomics
03:08:55 Gaia
03:08:56 I first did for more quality comics and remembered a certain ccp member talking and hustling around his scribbles all the time
03:09:05 A venture to his website went through all its contents in a very
03:09:10 Unsatisfyingly short amount of time and stayed dumbfounded and flabbergasted having a brain freeze over there not being
03:09:19 anything more
03:09:21 You can only tremble under the weight of the heaps of published content of giants like penny arcade and control alt delete
03:09:29 I couldn't get into penny arcade, but I hold control. They'll
03:09:33 Deep in my heart
03:09:35 The Kickstarter for their collective comics was the only one I ever successfully backed and its six kilo kilos of
03:09:42 Quality hardcore remains one of my most priceful sessions
03:09:46 I still remember being emotional about the mean loss
03:09:50 Since I wasn't plugged into the internet
03:09:52 I guys at the time
03:09:56 No matter
03:09:59 Also, Europe is in deep this funny voice. That's just his voice around any time. I don't think he's I don't think he's putting on a
03:10:07 Maybe he is I don't know who even knows
03:10:11 I don't know. Is he just saying like like ben saint, uh, where's the quantity? I want quantity not quality
03:10:18 That's fair. You know what I respect it
03:10:20 I
03:10:21 I want anything. I can't even disagree. I can't I I I want more ben sane comics. Well, yeah
03:10:28 I'm a fan of Ben Sane's comic after I finish the secret project. I will go back and I'll make some I'll make some of that stuff
03:10:35 I promise I promise
03:10:38 uh, but
03:10:39 I never read uh, penny arcade much, but I did play penny arcades on the rain slick precipice of darkness 3
03:10:46 I I have not played the
03:10:48 Uh, and I like that. I don't you I don't think you listened to the last week's episode
03:10:52 But uh, I was saying then like I don't I don't think I don't think anybody likes the penny arcade comic
03:10:58 Like I don't know anybody who actually thinks they're good. Um, the rain slick precipice of dark rain slick precipice of darkness
03:11:05 I've never played it and I don't particularly want to but I am like amazed every time I remember that such a thing exists
03:11:13 There's four. Yeah
03:11:15 The fourth one is like made by like a different studio or something, right?
03:11:21 The third and the fourth one are made by um, we're made by zboy. Yeah, boy
03:11:25 Like cthulhu saves the world in breath of death seven. I think
03:11:29 Is how you say, right? I want to hear this guy's opinion on millenverse
03:11:32 A bunch of a bunch of the uh DLC the penny arcade dlc podcasts involve them talking about like
03:11:40 Oh god this week was such a fucking uh, I had to like write all these item descriptions for the game
03:11:47 Or I had to like I had to like do all these like these art assets for the game or whatever
03:11:51 I had to
03:11:52 You just like a bunch of them are them talking about like their role in the like creative process while for the studio
03:11:59 That was making one of the rain slick precipice of darkness games
03:12:03 So I'm like interested in them as like an artifact
03:12:06 Uh, I mean, is it good? Is is number three? I would
03:12:10 Uh, the the the one I played. Yeah, I actually kind of liked it. It's uh, it's like a simple jrpg
03:12:16 it kind of has it kind of has combat like, uh
03:12:20 I think I think it's like found fancy 10 or like vagrant story or something where you can like you can see the uh
03:12:26 You can see how like how the turn order is going to play out before you do anything
03:12:30 And uh, it's it's pretty easy game for I remember because they heal you after every battle, but I didn't really mind that
03:12:36 That's pretty funny too. It's been years since I've played it though. Okay
03:12:41 It's it's just
03:12:44 Every everything everything that exists
03:12:47 Because of penny arcade is like a weird thing that should that shouldn't exist but does and is funny
03:12:55 And it's it's it's more interesting than the comic itself. Absolutely. Absolutely. I wish that was me
03:13:02 Me too. No, I just I I don't like penny arcades comics
03:13:06 Damn, but I want to I just want to like steal their skin and live their life
03:13:11 I'm gonna do something called bill and con
03:13:13 One of the days is gonna be great
03:13:16 Uh, the next one is called

03:14:19 Pitch is an idea for a movie and if it's good
03:14:22 We'll pick it up and chugga conroy pitched his idea for a movie and it was called water falls and it was about a guy called
03:14:29 I think his first name was waters and he was basically like a waterbender
03:14:35 No, it's called water I need to hear your hands you need to send here's the here's the kind of here's the kind of like
03:14:42 It's like lost media basically his pitch is because I couldn't find it
03:14:45 I think he took it down because it was kind of a very silly ass pitch
03:14:49 It's called water hands. Yeah. Yeah, we'll call it water hands or something and the character had a sister called water falls
03:14:58 And I remember him and I only knew that was chugga conroy years later because I
03:15:03 Needed to like pass a level in a game and I looked up a left play and I found chugga's and I watched a little bit of it
03:15:09 And he mentioned it for a brief second like oh this I think it was a Mega Man game
03:15:14 He's he's like, oh, yeah, this this power kind of reminds you of my character from my my idea for a series of called water
03:15:22 Hands and I'm like wait a second. This is the guy who pitched water hands. Oh
03:15:27 God a fame a fake shock. You know, you know chugga conroy as the water

03:15:36 Just so funny
03:15:39 The next next voicemail next voicemail is called poke. Well, no, it's called Pokemon
03:15:45 But if it was good three two one go black and white
03:15:50 I'm like a month late on this topic
03:15:52 But use was asking if there's a Pokemon game that doesn't suck shit and drop the ball 20 times in a row
03:15:56 Well, I got one for you. It does everything the fans have been clamoring for it has every Pokemon
03:16:01 It retains all the mechanics from previous gens. It's an MMO. You can have your mom's follow you outside their ball
03:16:07 It's highly customizable. You might not have heard of it. It's called the procrastinator's Minecraft server Ben
03:16:12 You fucking Dweebeheimer. How does this always skip your mind when the topic of Pokemon done right comes up?
03:16:17 Pixelmon is the solution to the game-free question or GQ if you will not only that it's also the endless war Pokemon
03:16:24 Romhack except a thousand times better because it's CW and 3d. That's right. We're recreating lock a common 3d
03:16:29 And it's fucking based it's being slowly developed
03:16:31 But one day it'll be home to all the rough houses and cop kids to commit gang violence to their hearts content
03:16:36 As of this podcast going live the server is free to enter for the next week
03:16:40 I've decided this is just canon now and there's nothing you can do about it
03:16:44 Actually, you know, I have any rck people getting for free forever. Fuck it. Can it bam, whoa, okay?
03:16:53 Does he can he do that did we give him the permission to do that

03:17:31 There it is three two one go
03:17:35 Hello, my name is actual do and if you are reading this I am gone
03:17:41 I'm writing this letter as a way for my memories to not simply vanish from this place
03:17:48 So that some may learn from my mistakes
03:17:53 Ben
03:17:55 You utter fucking moron
03:17:58 because of you and your
03:18:00 simply
03:18:01 Disgusting interest in the stock market. I decided
03:18:06 Maybe I should understand it better. I don't know much myself
03:18:11 And me being autistic. Well, I need the cause-and-effect relation
03:18:18 To understand
03:18:21 So I looked for it and I looked and I looked and through the halls of
03:18:27 Investopedia I read and the more I read the less I understood the more I I fucking
03:18:34 Grasp to the difference between an option a future a currency and a commodity the more I could feel my brain
03:18:42 implode from within
03:18:44 Do not try to understand the stock market some things are meant to not be understood
03:18:52 So fuck you Ben you motherfucker
03:18:57 Say you know
03:19:06 All you have to understand about the stuff it's so easy all you have to understand is buy a game stop and hold
03:19:12 Just buy a game stop and don't sell high American Psycho. Just don't sell it. That's all it is to it
03:19:20 Couldn't be couldn't be simpler. You know that one scene where Christian Bale like
