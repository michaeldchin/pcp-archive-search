00:00:00 Look at the stars. Look how they shine for you. And everything you do. Yeah, they were all yellow.
00:00:11 I came along. I wrote a song for you. And all the things you do. And it was called yellow.
00:00:24 So then I took my turn. Oh, what a thing to have done. And it was all yellow. Your skin.
00:00:36 Oh yeah, your skin and bones turned into something beautiful. And you know I love you so. You know I love you so.
00:00:55 Digibro. Pro Crastinators. 2016, y'all. Let's do this shit.
00:01:03 Rolled up at Coldplay in 08. Songs were great but the stage play made an impression. I'm guessing the old white folds to the show never give the solicit, but here's my position. I need some invention.
00:01:12 Not iteration, not the basics of emotion, but basic reaction. Some action, suburb of the verse. Suburb of the curses you spit.
00:01:19 Not a clean up, clean cut show, but it's a burp and I dance with the kids. I need some legit.
00:01:23 It's that time that you know what they act with the real stuff, the text that this is.
00:01:26 A little bit of it, but shadowing that hell to come. It's a totally complete piece of shit.
00:01:29 So sit back, motherfucker, get lit, cause the podcast is always fucked. You definitely want it quit.
00:01:37 Hello and welcome to another episode of the Pro Crastinators podcast. Here back again with all your favorite internet people.
00:01:43 It's not yellow!
00:01:45 Oh fucking god, you're a host.
00:01:48 All right, let's settle it down. I'm your host, the best guy ever, bestie boy.
00:01:53 Fuck you, I ruined the podcast.
00:01:54 Here with all my internet friends, we've got patreon.com.bensaint.
00:01:58 Former internet friends.
00:02:01 Yes, that's right. The DeVoo Collective.
00:02:03 Yo.
00:02:05 21st century digital boy.
00:02:07 See, the fact is that we can't ever escape each other cause we're all a part of the DeVoo Collective.
00:02:12 That's exactly right.
00:02:13 There's no fucking breaking out of this hell.
00:02:15 Hip-O-Crit.
00:02:17 It is yellow.
00:02:19 Thank you.
00:02:20 Endless, endless jessicles.
00:02:22 Who's ready to argue about Homestuck for an hour, guys.
00:02:25 Yeah, feels that way.
00:02:27 And me, the best guy of all.
00:02:29 So, today is a couple of times before we've taken suggestions on what the topics been from comments and stuff,
00:02:37 but today is a suggestion from a friend of ours, our buddy Nino.
00:02:41 Or, like, Nino90 or something?
00:02:43 Nino. You can Google him Nino. We'll put a link to his shit in the bottom.
00:02:46 And, by the way, Quick Plug, he made the coolest song ever, just today we heard it,
00:02:50 called Jacoshie on his SoundCloud.
00:02:52 I'm gonna put a link to that and this shit, too, cause it was so dope, everyone in the world should listen to it.
00:02:56 So, everybody go listen to it.
00:02:57 And his topic suggestion was things you just can't get into.
00:03:01 Things you can't get into.
00:03:03 And so, there's no urban dictionary for that shit, we're just gonna have to feel it out ourselves.
00:03:07 So, anyone have anything to say on the topic of things you can't get into?
00:03:11 Cause I've just got a bunch of examples, personally.
00:03:13 Well, I generally think it's annoying when an internet person, like, talks about it and then says it too many times.
00:03:19 And they're like, oh yeah, I can't get into this and I can't get into that.
00:03:22 When I don't get the sense that they're really even trying in the first place.
00:03:27 I feel that something that you just can't get into should be a really special status for a thing.
00:03:32 Is that the definition we're gonna use?
00:03:34 For example, someone's doing a crunchyroll plug and they're like, I tried watching this anime but I just couldn't get into it.
00:03:39 It's like, nigga, you don't even care about fucking crunchyroll, you care about anime.
00:03:42 That kind of shit pisses me off.
00:03:44 People that, I have a friend who I tried to get to play Undertale and he was like, oh, I just can't get into reading things.
00:03:53 I just can't get into reading the text.
00:03:56 I was like that, well, yeah.
00:03:58 I agree with DeVoo, but mostly in the context.
00:04:01 I don't mind if it's like, hey, I'm on this guy's vlogging channel and he listed 10 different shows that people asked him about.
00:04:07 I can't get into that one, I can't get into that.
00:04:09 But when someone writes a whole review of a movie and they're like, I just couldn't get into it, I'm sorry, guys.
00:04:16 And I'm like, why'd you fucking make a video about it?
00:04:18 No one cares that you couldn't get into it.
00:04:20 That's the least interesting sense.
00:04:22 When they let all these things that they just can't get into be part of their mythos.
00:04:26 As everyone knows, I'm not the kind of person who can get into this or the person who can get into that.
00:04:31 That's so stupid.
00:04:33 I think to some extent, Yahtzee is kind of annoying about that.
00:04:36 He has all these things.
00:04:38 He probably can't get into JRPGs at all, right?
00:04:41 Proudly wearing their inability to appreciate something on their sleeve is a really obnoxious character trait.
00:04:48 I can't get into rap or something. I don't listen to any.
00:04:53 I'm not proud of that. I'm kind of ashamed that I don't understand this art form.
00:04:57 Just five minutes ago, before we started the podcast, you were saying, what?
00:05:02 This rap was done using a beat that wasn't made by the same guy who did the rap. That's terrible.
00:05:06 No, no, no, no. I thought it was something else.
00:05:09 He was misinterpreted.
00:05:12 I appreciate that Yahtzee.
00:05:15 I don't expect everybody to get into everything.
00:05:19 I think with something like games, people group them all together.
00:05:23 It's all video games, but they're really so different that it's understandable to have ones you can't get into.
00:05:28 I'm glad that Yahtzee at some point said, I'm not going to cover JRPGs and fighting games anymore.
00:05:34 He cut them out of his life and of his reviews.
00:05:37 He's annoying because of his attitude. His attitude is the double-edged sword that makes him who he is.
00:05:42 The approach I'm going to take in this podcast is, for me, anything I can't get into, like Ben said,
00:05:50 I'm disappointed in myself. I'm on a constant quest to get into everything.
00:05:56 Stuff that I just can't get into is like a major failing.
00:06:01 By the way, let's just clarify, not being able to get into something is very different from disliking something that you experience.
00:06:08 Totally different.
00:06:09 They can be the same thing.
00:06:10 It could be the same, but it doesn't have to be.
00:06:13 If you watch something and it leaves no impression on you, that's more...
00:06:18 You seem to have a well-figured outlist and stuff, so why don't you lead the charge here and show us all what we're looking for?
00:06:26 Yeah, I put some thought into this. Mine are a little bit less specific pieces of media or anything I couldn't get into.
00:06:33 There were sort of more things over the years that I've been interested in and just never really found a comfortable place in my life for them.
00:06:40 Let me see. I've got three bigger examples here.
00:06:44 Here's my favorite one.
00:06:47 Back in college, me and my buddies...
00:06:50 What is it?
00:06:51 It's like playing video games with other people.
00:06:55 Unless it's like a fighting game, obviously that is built for that.
00:06:59 But being able to play any kind of game while other people are in the room has always been a big problem for me.
00:07:05 It was particularly an issue when in college, me and my buddies did nothing but sit around and play video games all day.
00:07:11 When we played Smash Bros. Brawl, it was great. We all had a fantastic time.
00:07:15 But then my buddies would play their favorite RPGs because we all played that kind of shit.
00:07:21 One of them recommended... I enjoyed being in the area while other people were playing a game. That was great.
00:07:26 Eventually, someone would recommend... I played Tales of Symphonia. That was a game recommended to me at the time.
00:07:32 I played it and my friend, quote-unquote Mike, as he's known, was there.
00:07:38 That's just his name.
00:07:42 He's just Mike in quotations. That's his name, yeah.
00:07:47 Wait, hang on. I thought he was your quote-unquote friend, Mike.
00:07:53 The term has become interchangeable. He goes by quote.
00:07:56 My quote-unquote friend, quote-unquote Mike.
00:08:00 I don't really know anything about him.
00:08:03 Everything I know about him is by implication only.
00:08:07 He recommended that I play Tales of Symphonia, and I did.
00:08:10 He, quote-unquote, recommended it.
00:08:13 He, quote-unquote, played this game, and so I, quote-unquote, did.
00:08:17 It was a good game. I liked it a lot, and I beat it.
00:08:20 But the thing was, that game has a Final Fantasy IX kind of multiplayer aspect.
00:08:25 We're in battles.
00:08:27 Oh, god, you played it multiplayer?
00:08:28 Of course we did, because he wanted to play too.
00:08:31 That's how we played Secret of Mana back in the day.
00:08:34 That's very different.
00:08:35 Secret of Mana.
00:08:36 And back when we were totally uncritical children, it was fine.
00:08:39 I gotta tell you guys.
00:08:40 As adults, I'm sure it would be infuriating.
00:08:41 That's the thing. Back in the day, me and Ben played all the...
00:08:44 I would sit right next to Ben, watch him play video games.
00:08:47 We played Secret of Mana together.
00:08:48 It was, I remember those days so fondly. It was fantastic.
00:08:51 But when I got older, playing...
00:08:53 Let me real quickly to clarify the difference between Secret of Mana and Tales of Symphonia.
00:08:57 In Tales of Symphonia, first player does everything,
00:09:01 and then once you get into one of the random battles,
00:09:04 then second player gets control of one of your characters
00:09:07 who would ordinarily be controlled by the AI fighting with you.
00:09:11 But the camera still follows player one.
00:09:14 So you're basically a glorified NPC in this game.
00:09:19 Once the battle's over, then player two just sits down as controller
00:09:23 and fucking player one does everything else.
00:09:25 It's not fun, really.
00:09:26 At the very least, you're going to have such small...
00:09:29 Because it's a fucking JRPG. It's all fucking talking all day,
00:09:32 and then there's a couple cool fights, and then you're out of random battles.
00:09:35 It's a little sister multiplayer, where it's like,
00:09:37 if you're like 15 and you've got a five-year-old sister or brother,
00:09:42 and they are like, I want to play video games, you're like here.
00:09:45 Secret of Mana is so much better for that,
00:09:47 because unless there's pretty few hardcore cutscenes in that game,
00:09:50 you're always able to just run around and do whatever as player two.
00:09:53 It's a great game.
00:09:54 But the point is just, when I got older,
00:09:57 I was 17 at the time playing this game with all my friends around.
00:10:00 The thing is, we all wanted to talk, because that's what we always did.
00:10:04 We would sit around, we would talk, and I would get so angry
00:10:07 when people would talk over voiced cutscenes,
00:10:09 and there's a million of those in that fucking game,
00:10:11 including little dialogue pop-ups that happened,
00:10:13 and it infuriating me.
00:10:15 And their presence made the experience horrible for me,
00:10:20 and my need to hear everything.
00:10:22 They'd be talking to me like, guys, shut up.
00:10:24 I'm trying to hear the story. I can't hear what they're saying.
00:10:26 Made it horrible for them.
00:10:28 It was terrible for everyone.
00:10:30 People talking during movies.
00:10:32 I mean, it's a similar issue.
00:10:33 I was going to say movies are the same.
00:10:35 Watching movies with people, I just...
00:10:37 Oh my God. Watching movies with a fucking woman.
00:10:39 They never shut their goddamn yaps.
00:10:42 And then, 20 minutes into the movie,
00:10:44 I don't know what's happening, because you're fucking shut up.
00:10:47 Oh my God, why aren't you paying attention, you dumb bitch?
00:10:49 Oh my God.
00:10:51 I would actually rather shoot myself in the head with a gun
00:10:54 than watch a movie with a woman.
00:10:56 The time I remember that most strongly was...
00:10:58 Ben might remember this. We were at like a family...
00:11:00 I want to say a family reunion.
00:11:02 I think at Uncle Andy's house.
00:11:04 And they were playing The Big Lebowski in the basement.
00:11:08 And I had always wanted to see The Big Lebowski.
00:11:10 I was fairly young at the time, maybe like 18.
00:11:12 And I was excited to see this movie.
00:11:14 And then my fucking cousins and the adults...
00:11:17 At this point in my life, I hated alcohol and it terrified me.
00:11:20 Everyone piled into the basement to hit up the fucking bar.
00:11:23 And they just kept talking.
00:11:25 And they kept talking. And they got louder.
00:11:27 And they got louder. And more people came down.
00:11:29 And they got drunker. And then they were like, hey Nate, what are you doing?
00:11:31 Why are you all by yourself over here, Nate?
00:11:33 Trying to watch this movie?
00:11:35 What are you doing, Nate? Why would you be here?
00:11:37 We're trying to have a party here.
00:11:39 It's not like you people put on the fucking movie.
00:11:41 And I just chose to sit down and watch it.
00:11:43 You're getting away from the topic.
00:11:45 That's true.
00:11:47 And even the original thing you're saying
00:11:49 sounds a little bit more like a gripe
00:11:51 that it does a thing you can't get into.
00:11:53 No, no. I don't know.
00:11:55 Let me just clarify it.
00:11:57 My two-player tells us of Podia.
00:11:59 That's definitely the horrible esoteric topic
00:12:01 that makes no sense in that.
00:12:03 Alright, we can move on.
00:12:05 As soon as I finish my point, which is just that
00:12:07 we would play other games.
00:12:09 And whenever I wasn't the one
00:12:11 who was playing the game, if I just came in
00:12:13 to do whatever,
00:12:15 it would always be a great time.
00:12:17 My friend was playing...
00:12:19 Fuck, what was it? I can't remember.
00:12:21 It doesn't matter. Jesus.
00:12:23 The point is, I've always hated that experience
00:12:25 and I'd like to be able to do it
00:12:27 because I know lots of people have fun doing it.
00:12:29 Alright, that's my first example,
00:12:31 but we can move on to somebody else's shit.
00:12:33 Hit those.
00:12:35 Okay.
00:12:37 There's a forest near my house
00:12:39 and there's this big old tree
00:12:41 and it's got a thing underneath it
00:12:43 and I just can't get into it anymore.
00:12:45 I used to be able to...
00:12:47 But I'm too big now.
00:12:49 And it makes me really sad.
00:12:51 Every time!
00:12:53 I know that feeling.
00:12:55 I got fat and...
00:12:57 Hit but I'm surprised you can't fit in there, honestly.
00:12:59 Well, it's a very small...
00:13:01 You got the big bones. It's his hair.
00:13:03 I do actually have...
00:13:05 I do actually have a thing.
00:13:07 Okay.
00:13:09 Now what? I forgot it.
00:13:11 I forget it.
00:13:13 Alright, Ben.
00:13:15 We need more PCPs like you.
00:13:17 Oh, the points gone?
00:13:19 No, no.
00:13:21 Right.
00:13:23 It was about the idea that
00:13:25 considering what everybody said about
00:13:27 getting into something
00:13:29 and not trying,
00:13:31 I'm very much the person who doesn't try.
00:13:33 I can get into anything.
00:13:35 It's just the actually
00:13:37 opening it up and looking at it.
00:13:39 And it set the tree.
00:13:41 But if somebody really pushes
00:13:43 something to be like...
00:13:45 If something is considered among everybody
00:13:47 to be really, really good, then I'll look at it
00:13:49 like Ava or something.
00:13:51 But sometimes the fact that they're pushing it
00:13:53 makes it less appealing.
00:13:55 That's how I feel about Game of Thrones.
00:13:57 I don't want to get into Game of Thrones
00:13:59 because everyone's constantly talking about it.
00:14:01 But it's not that I can't get into it.
00:14:03 I'm sorry I won't be able to.
00:14:05 Yeah, I'm kind of the same.
00:14:07 I'm pretty hesitant to pick up a new thing.
00:14:09 It's just like...
00:14:11 Everything sucks.
00:14:13 So when you pick up a new thing, odds are it's going to suck.
00:14:15 I never pick up a new thing
00:14:17 unless it's been recommended to me by
00:14:19 multiple trusted sources.
00:14:21 Yeah.
00:14:23 I don't trust any sources.
00:14:25 So I pick up absolutely everything.
00:14:27 If Nate recommends me an anime
00:14:29 and then independently some other person
00:14:31 is like, hey, have you heard about this anime?
00:14:33 I'll be like, oh shit, that's twice.
00:14:35 Maybe there's something to it.
00:14:37 Yeah.
00:14:39 I've never, ever in my life had someone
00:14:41 whose taste correlated
00:14:43 with mine enough
00:14:45 that they could recommend me something
00:14:47 and I would be like, oh yeah,
00:14:49 that obviously is going to be something I'll like.
00:14:51 Well yeah, okay, but you can figure out
00:14:53 why they like it and then figure out
00:14:55 how that relates to what you like.
00:14:57 I guess, but like I said, my method is
00:14:59 just to literally watch everything.
00:15:01 I won't be able to trust anyone until I try it.
00:15:03 Like with Game of Thrones,
00:15:05 there's nobody who could tell me
00:15:07 that it was good
00:15:09 in a way that I wanted to watch it.
00:15:11 And then finally, the only reason I did
00:15:13 is because it was like, it was so
00:15:15 fucking universal that I was like, I gotta at least
00:15:17 let's just fucking, I sat down with Victor
00:15:19 and I had seen like a few scenes
00:15:21 here and there that I thought were kind of cool.
00:15:23 You know, I'd seen the red wedding on TV
00:15:25 and I was like, oh alright, that's kind of cool.
00:15:27 So then I watched it,
00:15:29 but no one can ever like just talk me
00:15:31 into watching something. I have to
00:15:33 just check out everything.
00:15:35 Except the seasonal anime charts.
00:15:37 Alright, who else has got it?
00:15:39 I guess, I guess Steven Universe though.
00:15:41 We all kind of talked each other into that one.
00:15:43 I got recommended because all you guys
00:15:45 are watching it, so yeah.
00:15:47 Alright, alright, so my first
00:15:49 item of things I can't get into
00:15:51 is something that I used to be very into.
00:15:53 And that is Dungeons & Dragons
00:15:55 and or Tabletop
00:15:57 role-playing games in general.
00:15:59 Now, as a
00:16:01 youngen, I was very taken
00:16:03 with my self-image as a
00:16:05 quote-unquote nerdy kid
00:16:07 as a, you know, as an
00:16:09 intellectual, little fucking smart
00:16:11 nerd guy. And the image of that
00:16:13 on TV portrayed these people
00:16:15 as playing Dungeons & Dragons.
00:16:17 So I was like, oh I gotta get into Dungeons & Dragons
00:16:19 and I found some stuff, I figured it out.
00:16:21 I invited all my friends and we all played
00:16:23 Dungeons & Dragons all the time.
00:16:25 And it was a fine and dandy way to hang out.
00:16:27 But that's all it really was.
00:16:29 Agreed.
00:16:31 The thing about D&D is
00:16:33 like, yeah, ostensibly
00:16:35 the point of it is to tell
00:16:37 a story. Like the point of D&D
00:16:39 is that a story unfolds.
00:16:41 But like everything about
00:16:43 the game itself stands in
00:16:45 the way of good storytelling.
00:16:47 It is all based on fucking...
00:16:49 I mean, a great Dungeon Master can pull
00:16:51 a great story out of even the stupidest
00:16:53 scenario. That's fine.
00:16:55 But like, it's all based on random chance.
00:16:57 It's all couched in these
00:16:59 stupid fucking combat mechanics.
00:17:01 Every time I play D&D and there's a fight,
00:17:03 every fight takes like hours
00:17:05 and they're boring because nothing
00:17:07 narratively interesting happens during a fight.
00:17:09 It's all just fucking dy-
00:17:11 And it's like everyone having to wait for everyone else to go. It's the worst.
00:17:13 I did a pen and paper role play with
00:17:15 my friends. We just sort of invented our own
00:17:17 rules. We did something really basic.
00:17:19 That's the way to go. Make your own rules.
00:17:21 Whenever we wanted to do something that was fun
00:17:23 or dialogue focused, I would just
00:17:25 simplify the rules. It was basically
00:17:27 like one of the new Paper Mario games.
00:17:29 We're just like, okay, just one hit
00:17:31 will kill this enemy, but like five hits
00:17:33 will kill you. Alright, how about that? No more health points
00:17:35 today. You know, Ben,
00:17:37 looking back on it, I think there were exactly
00:17:39 two times I had a good time doing RPG stuff.
00:17:41 The first was our like
00:17:43 Homestuck one that you ran. Yes.
00:17:45 Which was awesome. Spurg. I talk about it
00:17:47 in my interview. Oh, yes.
00:17:49 I was. Yeah, Nate was in that.
00:17:51 I was Luke something,
00:17:53 the guy. I don't remember what I was.
00:17:55 You were the heir of life. Oh, yeah, it was awesome.
00:17:57 I brought life.
00:17:59 Your power set was about animating
00:18:01 objects. It was super
00:18:03 dope. And the other time was
00:18:05 do you remember, Ben, back at College
00:18:07 Academy, that guy Kevin
00:18:09 the DM. That was like the first time I
00:18:11 played DM and he fucking killed that
00:18:13 shit. Me and Nate
00:18:15 both did the summer program as
00:18:17 kids where we went to
00:18:19 the point is it was like a thing for smart kids.
00:18:21 And we were in the Mentos Trio
00:18:23 of the Mentos. Holy shit.
00:18:25 The Mentos Trio is life.
00:18:27 We gotta go back. We gotta save
00:18:29 the Mentos Trio for another day. Okay.
00:18:31 But yeah, they had
00:18:33 a class at this thing that was basically just playing
00:18:35 Dungeons and Dragons and the kid who
00:18:37 the guy, well, not a kid, a guy who ran it
00:18:39 was this dude Kevin Powers. Yes.
00:18:41 Who had, he was like as tall,
00:18:43 extremely white, extremely skinny
00:18:45 nerd. But he was
00:18:47 with the voice of Barry White. He was really into jazz
00:18:49 music and he had the deepest
00:18:51 baritone voice I've ever
00:18:53 heard in my life. Fuck yeah, Kevin.
00:18:55 And he would
00:18:57 he would roll the dice and be like, uh
00:18:59 I, is there a, I attack the monster
00:19:01 and he'd be like, mmm, the kobold
00:19:03 reels back from the savage
00:19:05 blow of your mighty war hammer.
00:19:07 He was such a badass. Roll for damage.
00:19:09 That was the best
00:19:11 that was the best possible experience
00:19:13 of D&D playing that. You guys
00:19:15 you know, I've noticed an issue with all
00:19:17 of your things so far is
00:19:19 I can't, one thing I can't
00:19:21 get into is such and such. Except for that one
00:19:23 time I totally got into it.
00:19:25 It's kind of going against the spirit of the thing.
00:19:27 You know what, Ben admitted that he used to be into it.
00:19:29 Let me, let me bring it, let me bring it
00:19:31 to, let me bring it to why I can't stand
00:19:33 it now. One, the rules
00:19:35 are cumbersome and there's too many of
00:19:37 them. Two,
00:19:39 playing it with people is a nightmare because
00:19:41 when you get together everyone has their own idea
00:19:43 for how to have fun playing it and
00:19:45 combat takes for fucking ever and
00:19:47 everyone else's turn is the most boring
00:19:49 thing in the world. Only your own turn is interesting
00:19:51 and it is a minority of the experience.
00:19:53 You just fucking sit around
00:19:55 and do nothing and just fucking
00:19:57 deal with all this rule-y bullshit and I fucking
00:19:59 hate it. I hate it so much.
00:20:01 It's not like inherent.
00:20:03 The inherent format isn't a problem
00:20:05 for you. It's just like the, it's
00:20:07 about the way it's always done. No, it is the format.
00:20:09 Some people like it. No, no, no.
00:20:11 There are better games
00:20:13 than D&D that have less crunchy
00:20:15 rules and are less annoying about it.
00:20:17 I still think they kind of end up being
00:20:19 annoying because of the social aspect.
00:20:21 D&D itself
00:20:23 I think is a particularly bad game.
00:20:25 I think for me, because
00:20:27 I'm piggybacking on yours, I also can't
00:20:29 get into tabletop games and just like
00:20:31 you it was a thing that I grew up thinking
00:20:33 looked cool and like obviously
00:20:35 it was like what all the big kids did instead
00:20:37 of like, you know, like it's
00:20:39 like a bit better than video games
00:20:41 because it's real and tactile and you're making
00:20:43 it up yourself. Hold on, dude.
00:20:45 I remember specifically in your old Q&A
00:20:47 you said that like you could just play Arkham Horror
00:20:49 for two weeks if the power went out and you'd
00:20:51 have a great time because you had done that
00:20:53 before when the power went out one time.
00:20:55 Oh, shit. Yeah, we did do that
00:20:57 and Arkham Horror is not really a role-play
00:20:59 game so much as like Arkham Horror.
00:21:01 I had no idea what it was. I had no idea
00:21:03 what it was. I thought maybe it's a prequel
00:21:05 to one of the Batman games, the board game
00:21:07 edition. I don't know. Yeah, that's what it is.
00:21:09 It's a HP Lovecraft inspired board game
00:21:11 that's so intricately
00:21:13 intricate in the way you play it.
00:21:15 Yeah, by the way, David, they're both inspired
00:21:17 by Arkham from Lovecraft.
00:21:21 So, but yeah, like that's
00:21:23 sort of a different thing, but like with pen and paper
00:21:25 which I'm not that into board games either
00:21:27 at all, just because
00:21:29 they take so fucking long to set up and do everything.
00:21:31 Sam, I used to be into board games and now
00:21:33 I just think... Oh, that's why
00:21:35 that's like the best part in the board game series
00:21:37 when he has this one board game
00:21:39 that he's gonna play and like it's like five minutes
00:21:41 of him explaining how to set it up and
00:21:43 Motherfucker Mike is like, okay, when you're
00:21:45 gonna be finished setting it up and he's like,
00:21:47 well, you see, you also have to get these stats
00:21:49 in the right way and you gotta do this and you gotta do that.
00:21:51 And it's like this huge montage of saying everything
00:21:53 up and then at the end he's like, alright,
00:21:55 I'm all ready to go and Mike is bored and leaves.
00:21:57 Like, I'm gonna go now and I just like, oh man,
00:21:59 that's totally agreed
00:22:01 and relate to that, man. That's also
00:22:03 the Dungeons and Dragons experience because
00:22:05 every player's turn
00:22:07 lasts too fucking long
00:22:09 and nobody else is
00:22:11 like, unless you guys are like really
00:22:13 tightly packed as a group
00:22:15 into whatever event you're doing,
00:22:17 if everyone's doing something even slightly different
00:22:19 it's not relevant to anyone else.
00:22:21 So the second one guy gets his turn, everyone
00:22:23 else gets on their phones and starts fucking
00:22:25 texting other people and just wants to be anywhere
00:22:27 else because they don't care about what's going on in your fucking
00:22:29 story, especially if you're fighting something.
00:22:31 Like, nobody cares and then like in order
00:22:33 to make the story at all interesting or to
00:22:35 accommodate anybody's creativity,
00:22:37 then our DM would just like, you know,
00:22:39 basically say fuck most of the rules.
00:22:41 Like he would just be like, alright, well whatever.
00:22:43 And then eventually it got to a point
00:22:45 where we're like, well the story's not going anywhere
00:22:47 because it was just all of us
00:22:49 we're not fucking story
00:22:51 writers, we have no sense of narrative
00:22:53 progression, we're just digging around.
00:22:55 There's too many conflicting ideas going on.
00:22:57 My brother is great with that. We were in the final battle
00:22:59 of one of our game
00:23:01 and like the boss was about
00:23:03 to like unleash their ultimate attack
00:23:05 and I don't want any of the characters to
00:23:07 die, so like the final attack
00:23:09 is like heading towards my brother's character
00:23:11 and he's like, okay what do you do? And he's like
00:23:13 I slice it with my sword
00:23:15 and he rolls a two
00:23:17 and that's like a failure. I hit it
00:23:19 with the...
00:23:21 He got a two so he did it twice.
00:23:23 I hit it with the butt of my sword, he rolled a one.
00:23:25 I hit it with my left butt cheek, he rolled a one.
00:23:27 I tried to like fart in its general direction
00:23:29 and it rolled a two. He just kept getting further
00:23:31 and further into like abstract ways of
00:23:33 attacking until finally he rolled a four
00:23:35 and it succeeded.
00:23:37 And he's great.
00:23:39 That does not sound like any kind
00:23:41 of Dungeons and Dragons I have.
00:23:43 That's basically who my brother is like.
00:23:45 Because like I was physically moving
00:23:47 the attack towards his character so he kept
00:23:49 running out of time and had to come up with it
00:23:51 like in the span of a few seconds and it was glorious.
00:23:53 And so that's how...
00:23:55 I think I'm just
00:23:57 a lot less interested in the creativity
00:23:59 of my friends than I am in the creativity
00:24:01 of anyone who is trained
00:24:03 as an artist.
00:24:05 Related point,
00:24:07 my interest in
00:24:09 Dungeons and Dragons and board games pretty much
00:24:11 completely died
00:24:13 exactly at the moment that I became
00:24:15 interested in drawing and making my own
00:24:17 shit.
00:24:19 It's such a waste of time compared to that.
00:24:21 Sure is.
00:24:23 It's a creative endeavor only you don't get anything
00:24:25 out of it.
00:24:27 You're doing it with a bunch of people who aren't
00:24:29 creatives and have no stake
00:24:31 in becoming creative people because
00:24:33 they're not trying to do that
00:24:35 as a passion in your career.
00:24:37 You can see that by the way.
00:24:39 On your first session of D&D every time
00:24:41 it's everyone making their character.
00:24:43 Nobody knows how to fucking make their character.
00:24:45 It was like an entire fucking game.
00:24:47 So I guess what I would do in the future
00:24:49 is just you roll a six-sided die
00:24:51 and six means super successful.
00:24:53 Five means very successful.
00:24:55 And then one means a huge failure.
00:24:57 So you just decide what you're going to try to do
00:24:59 and you roll for the success level.
00:25:01 Let's see, there's a problem
00:25:03 even with that because the fact that your actions
00:25:05 are controlled by a random chance
00:25:07 means that the narrative that you want to
00:25:09 happen is not guaranteed to.
00:25:11 Going into trying to have a narrative
00:25:13 is not the way to go man.
00:25:15 Yeah, I mean
00:25:17 part of the idea of it is that
00:25:19 an interesting story is crafted.
00:25:21 Part of the idea is that an interesting
00:25:23 story can emerge through random chance.
00:25:25 That's absolutely right.
00:25:27 The story that me and my friends did
00:25:29 was interesting to us because...
00:25:31 But it won't because people aren't able to handle it.
00:25:33 Because what happened was one of my friends...
00:25:35 Do you want to take that risk
00:25:37 hundreds of hours, I don't know, dozens of hours
00:25:39 on a campaign that might be shit?
00:25:41 I think it's pretty much inevitably going to be interesting
00:25:43 with the right people because what happened was
00:25:45 my friend kept...
00:25:47 We had all the characters lined up on a grid
00:25:49 and stuff and one of my friends
00:25:51 kept happening to
00:25:53 move in just the right spaces
00:25:55 to constantly be in a circumstance
00:25:57 where she would probably trip
00:25:59 in the universe and so it became
00:26:01 a completely accidental running gag
00:26:03 that her character gets knocked over
00:26:05 or trips or falls.
00:26:07 It was totally organic and at one point
00:26:09 another character trips
00:26:11 into one of the NPCs and just the way
00:26:13 the dialogue ended up happening
00:26:15 he became one of the main characters
00:26:17 and I ended up having to play a character
00:26:19 coming. It was so cool.
00:26:21 And then there was one side character
00:26:23 exhibiting very suspicious behavior
00:26:25 just because I couldn't come up with
00:26:27 what the secrets were.
00:26:29 The point is I had to come up with a whole
00:26:31 secret special twist
00:26:33 on the go as I was going
00:26:35 and it turned out to be an incredible twist
00:26:37 that I wouldn't be able to explain here.
00:26:39 But yeah, a lot of really interesting...
00:26:41 I came up with a whole lore about...
00:26:43 Is this the D&D cost or what?
00:26:45 Yeah, I know.
00:26:47 I remember wanting to do it
00:26:49 with all the cool things that he did
00:26:51 with his friends doing D&D.
00:26:53 The thing is...
00:26:55 The point is Ben can't get into it, right?
00:26:57 That's all we're saying.
00:26:59 Fun things can happen and like
00:27:01 it can be really interesting and entertaining
00:27:03 and also a good way to hang out with friends
00:27:05 and all that stuff is cool.
00:27:07 I just think that it's way more pain than pleasure
00:27:09 and that the amount of bullshit you have to deal with
00:27:11 to get those benefits
00:27:13 are not worth it.
00:27:15 Alright, and the case has been made
00:27:17 and it has been contested and that's fine.
00:27:19 Let's move on to the next one.
00:27:21 Jesse, you got something you can't get into here?
00:27:23 Yeah.
00:27:25 There's a...
00:27:27 There's this webcomic.
00:27:29 This...
00:27:31 It's pretty popular.
00:27:33 It's like kind of a webcomic
00:27:35 but I guess it's also kind of like a shitty video game.
00:27:37 I don't know.
00:27:39 The art style is really gay.
00:27:41 The characters...
00:27:43 What's it called? Something about homos.
00:27:45 Something about homos and suck.
00:27:47 Ah, my god.
00:27:53 Is it...
00:27:55 Is it Homestar Runner?
00:27:57 Is that what you're talking about?
00:27:59 I like Homestar Runner personally.
00:28:05 Ringback Homestar.
00:28:07 Here's the thing with Jesse is that
00:28:09 if something is introduced to him in a contentious way
00:28:11 that he'll never be able to like...
00:28:13 God damn it!
00:28:15 Don't even fucking start because
00:28:17 you're not going to goad me into a fight.
00:28:19 Okay?
00:28:21 Because I thought about this long and hard.
00:28:23 Okay?
00:28:25 No one here is going to say some stupid shit
00:28:27 or infer some far out bullshit
00:28:29 about me that's going
00:28:31 to fucking get my blood pressure up.
00:28:33 I'm not going to have it. I'm not going to allow it
00:28:35 because I have constructed
00:28:37 the perfect
00:28:39 argument proof
00:28:41 example of why I can't
00:28:43 get into Homestuck.
00:28:45 We're all going to sit down.
00:28:47 We're going to sit in a circle.
00:28:49 We're going to have a calm, familial discussion.
00:28:51 We're going to have a Thanksgiving turkey.
00:28:53 I can do that if you can.
00:28:55 We're going to sip hot tea.
00:28:57 We're going to fucking play some oriental music
00:28:59 on like some strings.
00:29:01 We're just going to go to a fucking Chinese restaurant
00:29:03 and we're going to turn on some yellow lights
00:29:05 to light everything.
00:29:07 I don't know what those are.
00:29:09 I don't think that yellow lights
00:29:11 are actually a thing that exists.
00:29:13 They do it in a Chinese restaurant.
00:29:15 All the lights they put up are yellow lights.
00:29:17 I'm making a racial joke.
00:29:19 Okay, go on.
00:29:21 And what a joke it was.
00:29:23 Okay.
00:29:25 Homestuck.
00:29:27 It's fucking gay.
00:29:31 There it is!
00:29:33 There it is!
00:29:35 It was all worth it.
00:29:37 It was all worth it.
00:29:39 I don't even
00:29:41 disagree that it's gay.
00:29:43 It's pretty gay.
00:29:45 It is both ways.
00:29:47 It's homosexual
00:29:49 and it's gay as well.
00:29:51 I figured out the mental block
00:29:53 for real.
00:29:57 If something is
00:29:59 really long
00:30:01 but grabs me immediately
00:30:03 I can give it a chance.
00:30:05 If something doesn't
00:30:07 grab me immediately
00:30:09 but it's short and manageable
00:30:11 I can give it a chance.
00:30:13 Homestuck is both really long
00:30:15 and doesn't immediately grab me.
00:30:17 So that's just the two factors
00:30:19 right at once.
00:30:21 I know there's
00:30:23 some people say that it's
00:30:25 boring at the beginning and it only gets interesting
00:30:27 later when the trolls
00:30:29 or the time travel shit comes in.
00:30:31 I'm not saying that's what you think Jesse.
00:30:33 I don't think that's you.
00:30:35 A lot of people do say that.
00:30:37 For one totally disagree
00:30:39 I think Homestuck is
00:30:41 maybe not on the first page
00:30:43 but definitely within the first act.
00:30:45 It's really interesting.
00:30:47 I was also one of the people who
00:30:49 heard that
00:30:51 Victor read it before I did
00:30:53 and I just saw him reading it
00:30:55 and I'd never fucking heard of it at all.
00:30:57 So I saw him reading it
00:30:59 and
00:31:01 he was in Act 3
00:31:03 and he didn't really start enjoying it
00:31:05 until late into Act 3
00:31:07 and he was like I don't know
00:31:09 it doesn't really get good for a long time
00:31:11 and I was like I'll just read 5 pages
00:31:13 and if I'm not into it I'm not going to read it
00:31:15 because it's fucking long.
00:31:17 I read page 1 and I was like
00:31:19 this is the funniest thing I've ever read in my life
00:31:21 I'm going to read all of this.
00:31:23 It's funny right off the bat.
00:31:25 I don't know what people don't.
00:31:27 It's got its own sense of humor
00:31:29 that you have to adjust to a little bit.
00:31:31 It's funny but there's also a lot of these
00:31:33 long dialogue
00:31:35 that you have to scale.
00:31:37 Yeah but that's where the jokes are.
00:31:39 The way I got into Homestuck
00:31:41 is that I saw...
00:31:43 Jess is the only one of us who
00:31:45 reads books.
00:31:47 He's way more than all of us.
00:31:49 That's true.
00:31:51 What were you saying?
00:31:53 He was saying that.
00:31:55 I got into Homestuck because of
00:31:57 Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff.
00:31:59 Me too!
00:32:01 I saw that and I thought
00:32:03 the guy who made this was hilarious.
00:32:05 I got to read the main thing.
00:32:07 Dude, encourage me.
00:32:09 Shut up Nate!
00:32:11 Remember before the podcast started
00:32:13 when Nate was like I'm going to really try
00:32:15 not to cut anybody off.
00:32:17 I make tactical insertions
00:32:19 where I think people are going to stop.
00:32:21 The way that the rest of us do it
00:32:23 is someone starts talking
00:32:25 and we just wait for them to finish their point.
00:32:27 I can't afford to take that risk.
00:32:29 Sorry, go on Gib.
00:32:31 I forgot now.
00:32:33 You were saying you got into it through
00:32:35 Hella Jeff and Bro.
00:32:37 I didn't find
00:32:39 the very first act to be that as funny
00:32:41 but I kind of got it.
00:32:43 I feel like I would have
00:32:45 stuck through it anyway but
00:32:47 I don't know.
00:32:49 Me and my buddies
00:32:51 in college
00:32:53 we didn't even know Homestuck existed
00:32:55 but we read
00:32:57 all of Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff
00:32:59 thought it was the best thing ever
00:33:01 and had no idea about Homestuck.
00:33:03 I think until Ben showed me that Homestuck existed
00:33:05 and was a thing
00:33:07 and frankly I yearned for those days
00:33:09 before I knew.
00:33:11 I had seen Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff
00:33:13 I didn't really know.
00:33:15 I got into Sweet Bro through Homestuck
00:33:17 but the existence of Sweet Bro
00:33:19 and Hella Jeff is one of the best things
00:33:21 about Homestuck.
00:33:23 In the universe
00:33:25 there is this fucking
00:33:27 comic that exists
00:33:29 that one of the characters makes
00:33:31 and most of the
00:33:33 best memes in Homestuck
00:33:35 are not external memes
00:33:37 but are memes that were generated by the author
00:33:39 within this in-universe continuity
00:33:41 of Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff.
00:33:43 Reading the end recently
00:33:45 when Caliborn gets ripped
00:33:47 it was fantastic.
00:33:49 We've got Tom joining us.
00:33:51 Tom are you recording?
00:33:53 I am recording.
00:33:55 So
00:33:57 should we see Test right now?
00:33:59 I don't want to go too much into Homestuck
00:34:01 on account of
00:34:03 we I think will have a Homestuck
00:34:05 podcast at some point
00:34:07 once everyone finishes the story.
00:34:09 In all honesty
00:34:11 I'm so fucking tired of fighting
00:34:13 with you shitwits
00:34:15 so fucking I was fighting with these
00:34:17 dumb motherfuckers for like an hour
00:34:19 because they okay
00:34:21 you know what let's just get into this
00:34:23 I'm sick of holding it inside
00:34:25 We should get into this now because Jesse
00:34:27 isn't invited to the real Homestuck podcast
00:34:29 so this is the time to air his grievances
00:34:31 No this isn't about that he's about to talk about
00:34:33 lights about yellow
00:34:35 Oh fuck nevermind okay
00:34:37 These fucking guys they all fucking ganged up on me
00:34:39 it was like the people versus endless Jess
00:34:41 It wasn't ganging up on you
00:34:43 No no
00:34:45 No oh you were being aggressively wrong
00:34:47 every single one of you stupid idiots
00:34:49 objectively aggressively wrong
00:34:51 saying that my fucking video
00:34:53 looked yellow it does not look
00:34:55 yellow and you know what Jesse
00:34:57 I'm gonna post those fucking pictures
00:34:59 in the chat
00:35:01 I hope you do
00:35:03 You post those videos
00:35:05 and don't even say anything
00:35:07 don't say who did what and just say which one looks better
00:35:09 I dare you
00:35:11 Wait is the question which one looks better
00:35:13 or is it yellow
00:35:15 Okay well that too
00:35:17 Well nobody's
00:35:19 contesting which one looks better
00:35:21 I mean Nate might be because he has a personal opinion
00:35:23 There you go
00:35:25 I have also my own illustration that I put together
00:35:27 where I compare the individual
00:35:29 like pieces of Jesse's face
00:35:31 in almost all of his videos
00:35:33 like where it's got the um
00:35:35 the lighting that he has in almost all of his videos
00:35:37 versus
00:35:39 did we explain what the issue was
00:35:41 Jesse's videos he has a certain style of
00:35:43 lighting that all of us identify has
00:35:45 yellow lighting
00:35:47 but Jesse disagrees that it's yellow
00:35:49 lighting
00:35:51 even though I officially
00:35:53 I'm done
00:35:55 I thought we were gonna try to make these enraged Jesse less
00:35:57 It's just called incandescent lighting
00:35:59 I have an illustration of a visual
00:36:01 a graph that compares
00:36:03 like the actual colors
00:36:05 of his face and his beard
00:36:07 in that one scene
00:36:09 in one of his horseshoe reviews where he goes outside
00:36:11 and it's a totally different
00:36:13 less yellow color
00:36:15 I would even say that
00:36:17 Jesse's argument that
00:36:19 the color is normal
00:36:21 is also true
00:36:23 it is normal to live
00:36:25 in an incandescently
00:36:27 lit room because
00:36:29 most people have those type of light bulbs
00:36:31 it's just that the type of light that that is
00:36:33 is called yellow light
00:36:35 I don't disagree necessarily
00:36:37 that the lighting in that one
00:36:39 shot that I used of you being outside
00:36:41 is worse that might be true
00:36:43 you know because you just grabbed
00:36:45 the camera and talked out
00:36:47 I thought the outside shot looked way better
00:36:49 the outside shot looks like shit you're objectively
00:36:51 longer
00:36:53 the real issue is that
00:36:55 these people do not know what
00:36:57 yellow looks like they don't they literally
00:36:59 do not know what the color is
00:37:01 you don't fucking DeVoo proved that it's yellow
00:37:03 DeVoo proved himself wrong
00:37:05 these guys
00:37:07 they made images to try and
00:37:09 show me how wrong I was
00:37:11 and the images proved them wrong
00:37:13 and they can't accept it
00:37:15 in the video of you being outside
00:37:17 your face looks like pinkish grey
00:37:19 in the video of you being outside
00:37:21 Jesse what the
00:37:23 that's not an argument you're just making
00:37:25 retarded noises
00:37:27 in the basement
00:37:29 your face looks like pitch yellow
00:37:31 what's up everybody did you bro here
00:37:33 feeling uh
00:37:35 existential having a smoke
00:37:37 drunk after the end of that
00:37:39 podcast thinking about
00:37:41 my philosophical take on the color yellow
00:37:43 you know this shirt is obviously
00:37:45 yellow the light
00:37:47 being cast on me is actually from a fluorescent
00:37:49 light from inside of the
00:37:51 from inside of the
00:37:53 garage here
00:37:55 I feel like my face
00:37:57 tone is pretty close to my shirt tone
00:37:59 and yet this is definitely blue
00:38:01 light but you can tell that's blue the sky
00:38:03 is definitely blue and I
00:38:05 look over here see now that looks white
00:38:07 the you can tell that the white
00:38:09 the light is white or blue
00:38:11 rather which is what white light
00:38:13 is considered yet when it's
00:38:15 shining on me
00:38:17 I don't really look
00:38:19 I don't really look white I look more
00:38:21 yellowy but I look over
00:38:23 here and behind me
00:38:25 I can see
00:38:27 what are clearly
00:38:29 more clearly off camera
00:38:31 than on yellow lights
00:38:33 in the distance you can't even see me now probably
00:38:35 because it's quite dark out
00:38:37 but I'm thinking about the street lights right
00:38:39 and how
00:38:41 like I would always think of a street light
00:38:43 as yellow
00:38:45 but what is yellow
00:38:47 as a concept like
00:38:53 I think we'd all agree this
00:38:55 the light on my cigarette is yellow
00:38:59 but does yellow
00:39:01 mean a color that an object
00:39:03 is
00:39:05 or can lighting be
00:39:07 yellow
00:39:09 we can agree that
00:39:11 a monitor represents things in colors
00:39:13 a camera captures
00:39:15 things in colors but does light
00:39:17 actually
00:39:19 emit
00:39:21 colors
00:39:23 a different thing
00:39:25 is the sky blue
00:39:29 is my shirt
00:39:31 my shirt is definitely yellow
00:39:33 but if I have a yellow light on me
00:39:35 am I
00:39:37 yellow
00:39:39 what does yellow mean
00:39:43 I don't know what yellow means anymore
00:39:45 I have lost track
00:39:47 of the meaning of yellow
00:39:53 I
00:40:01 I guess yellow
00:40:03 like most things means what we want it to mean
00:40:11 I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about
00:40:13 character with yellow skin
00:40:15 like that's what your face looks like
00:40:17 do you people at home
00:40:19 do you hear how these morons are ganging up on me
00:40:21 they're so fucking insecure about how wrong they are
00:40:23 they just can't accept it
00:40:25 do you think people are supposed to look like
00:40:27 I want to clarify
00:40:29 simpsons characters are not what real humans look like
00:40:31 we're not actually yellow in real life
00:40:33 you're saying my video looks like a simpsons character
00:40:35 you're that fucking stupid
00:40:37 you have to understand where I'm coming from
00:40:39 at least
00:40:41 three years of watching your videos
00:40:43 and in most of them being yellow
00:40:45 I think some of them are lit by other means
00:40:47 but most of your videos have been
00:40:49 yellow for all this time
00:40:51 and you know like
00:40:53 here's how dumb these people are
00:40:57 digi goes
00:40:59 look jesse I'll show you a picture from one of my videos
00:41:01 that also looks yellow
00:41:03 he shows me a picture
00:41:05 it also doesn't look yellow at all
00:41:07 so it's yellow lighting
00:41:09 it's what it's called
00:41:11 I don't care what it's called if it's wrong digi
00:41:13 it's objectively not yellow
00:41:15 by the way we've been having this argument for three fucking years
00:41:17 just so everyone knows
00:41:19 this is not the first time the yellowness
00:41:21 of jesse's videos has come into question
00:41:23 I don't know if you've been around for the last one
00:41:25 but this is like an ongoing battle
00:41:27 for all time longer than the homestuck
00:41:29 first of all you're mischaracterizing
00:41:31 this is not about the yellowness of my videos
00:41:33 plural because not all my videos
00:41:35 are professionally lighted and professionally made
00:41:37 most of my videos are like vlogs
00:41:39 I don't care about the lighting
00:41:41 any time that I put effort into the lighting
00:41:43 it looks beautiful it looks perfect
00:41:45 I think great if you don't disagree
00:41:47 with those two statements
00:41:49 I disagree
00:41:51 I don't think any jesse video has beautiful visuals
00:41:53 or lighting
00:41:55 that may be the true
00:41:57 but let's not even get into it
00:41:59 we can't get into jesse's yellow
00:42:01 lighting or at least ben can't
00:42:03 in fact we shouldn't even be on this topic
00:42:05 at all because it has nothing to do with the
00:42:07 topic of the podcast so let's just
00:42:09 move on alright no it does because
00:42:11 I can't get into the insane frame of
00:42:13 mind that you people are in
00:42:15 that you see yellow where there was no fucking yellow
00:42:17 I can't get into it
00:42:19 to format where you could talk about literally anything
00:42:21 to clarify what I just said
00:42:23 I only mean that I don't think that
00:42:25 you know like good like high quality
00:42:27 visuals are one of the things people come
00:42:29 to a jesse video like that's not something I would
00:42:31 say that like the jesse channel
00:42:33 no matter what you say jesse is not going to listen
00:42:35 it's not going to matter I'm not talking to jesse
00:42:37 oh my god and let's talk about that okay
00:42:39 because they can't handle that he's wrong so he could
00:42:41 sound this high horse about oh jesse just never listens
00:42:43 to criticism he can't handle he can't
00:42:45 handle my hardcore criticism
00:42:47 my construction I'm just saying that you get
00:42:49 angry when people criticize your shit
00:42:51 no no no I get angry when people criticize
00:42:53 it wrong I get angry with wrong
00:42:55 criticism because your criticism is objectively
00:42:57 not true I don't care if gibbons
00:42:59 playing guitar you can play your guitar
00:43:01 you can sing your little gay boy songs all you want
00:43:03 it's not going to stop me it's not going
00:43:05 to quell this fire it's not going to
00:43:07 put the fire out gibbons you can play all night
00:43:09 I don't care
00:43:15 it's not yellow it's not
00:43:17 it's not yellow
00:43:19 what's something you can't get into
00:43:21 I don't even understand
00:43:23 what are you protecting enough
00:43:25 oh this is my hill to die on
00:43:27 what are you people saying
00:43:29 it's not yellow
00:43:31 it is not
00:43:33 this isn't even like this has nothing to do
00:43:35 this is not me going like oh my videos
00:43:37 are great don't critique my videos
00:43:39 this has nothing to do with whether I think it looks good
00:43:41 or not
00:43:43 this is not black
00:43:45 it's not yellow they just
00:43:47 are yellow
00:43:49 we feel the same way
00:43:51 towards you about this issue like how can you
00:43:53 not see it
00:43:55 you guys are seeing that isn't there
00:43:57 you don't know what yellow is
00:43:59 I can show you a picture of the color yellow
00:44:01 and you look at it and go yep that's yellow
00:44:03 and then I show you my video
00:44:05 perfect the fact that it is not
00:44:07 like hashtag
00:44:09 FF0069
00:44:11 good job
00:44:13 it's not the issue
00:44:15 is that actually the yellow
00:44:17 is it
00:44:19 do you think it looks good
00:44:21 you said it like this
00:44:23 I wanted to make a shirt called
00:44:25 it's pitch white and the text is
00:44:27 I'm hashtag
00:44:29 fucking white
00:44:31 because that's the code
00:44:33 I get it
00:44:35 what's the bottom line is that I made a video
00:44:37 that looked fucking natural
00:44:39 and beautiful and Nate's like
00:44:41 oh I'll show you how yellow it is
00:44:43 and he like color corrected and makes an image
00:44:45 this looks so much worse
00:44:47 ok so this room
00:44:49 looks one way right
00:44:51 and this room looks another way
00:44:53 cause this room
00:44:55 is lit
00:44:57 with fluorescent light
00:44:59 no this one is incandescent light
00:45:01 and this one is fluorescent light
00:45:03 incandescent light
00:45:05 is referred to as
00:45:07 yellow or warm light
00:45:09 whereas
00:45:11 fluorescent light is referred to as
00:45:13 blue or white
00:45:15 light
00:45:17 so
00:45:19 this this room
00:45:21 it looks normal
00:45:23 this is what a normal room looks like
00:45:25 and
00:45:27 you could say
00:45:29 that it's technically not
00:45:31 like nothing in the room is yellow
00:45:33 the room is not yellow and even the light
00:45:35 isn't
00:45:37 technically yellow it's just that
00:45:39 it has more yellow values
00:45:41 like the values
00:45:43 in what is being presented through the monitor
00:45:45 I'm like look at my hand right now
00:45:47 like
00:45:49 yeah it is skin colored
00:45:51 my hand is skin colored
00:45:53 but it does look
00:45:55 different
00:45:57 in this light
00:45:59 it is still skin colored
00:46:01 but the lighting looks different
00:46:03 and the way that that lighting
00:46:05 is represented
00:46:07 by a computer monitor
00:46:09 is to use more
00:46:11 yellow values
00:46:13 whereas in here it's more white values
00:46:15 this is more white
00:46:17 this is more yellow values
00:46:19 this is more white values or blue
00:46:21 blue values rather is what I mean to say
00:46:23 yellow light
00:46:25 both are normal
00:46:27 both I would describe
00:46:29 as normal light
00:46:31 a lot of people think this kind of light
00:46:33 looks cleaner
00:46:35 and I do think this kind of light
00:46:37 is very appropriate for the videos of someone
00:46:39 like MKBHD where he's talking about technology
00:46:41 because it's a very pristine
00:46:43 look to it you can see more
00:46:45 detail in
00:46:47 in white light it's easier
00:46:49 to pick out every individual
00:46:51 you know
00:46:53 in yellow light
00:46:55 it's more of this homie
00:46:57 nostalgic feel
00:46:59 when you think yellow light
00:47:01 you think I am in a house
00:47:03 and I think that if the
00:47:05 concept of your video
00:47:07 is that I am in
00:47:09 a house
00:47:11 then yellow light is appropriate
00:47:13 because whenever I see white light
00:47:15 like I said it makes sense in an MKBHD video
00:47:17 because he's talking about technology
00:47:19 but I always feel like it doesn't look like a real place
00:47:21 it doesn't look like his room
00:47:23 it doesn't look like a place where a person lives
00:47:25 because no one lives in this
00:47:27 I would not be able to live in a room
00:47:29 that looked like this
00:47:31 so to me having a room be
00:47:33 oh god my food's done
00:47:35 you know what I'm saying
00:47:37 it doesn't matter if it looks worse
00:47:39 the point is it looks less yellow
00:47:41 which it does
00:47:43 my videos does not look yellow in the first place
00:47:45 so no it does not look less yellow
00:47:47 it just looks like a different color
00:47:49 because it's yellow
00:47:51 it's gotta be one color
00:47:53 which other color is it
00:47:55 I can't fucking believe
00:47:57 that you guys are all seeing yellow
00:47:59 there's no I'm fucking
00:48:01 my wig is blown off
00:48:03 which color is it if it isn't yellow
00:48:05 I'm losing my fucking mind here
00:48:07 it's not a color
00:48:09 you know what I just realized that I still have my flux on
00:48:11 so maybe that's why
00:48:13 I'm seeing all this yellow
00:48:15 I just have to turn off flux
00:48:17 what's the thing that you can't get into
00:48:19 um
00:48:21 I have a couple things
00:48:23 one of them I said is I can't get into going to concerts
00:48:25 oh
00:48:27 okay that's a good one
00:48:29 I agree with you but I'm still fucking pissed off
00:48:31 I feel the same Tom
00:48:33 could you give us any anecdotes
00:48:35 I mean I haven't even really gone
00:48:37 to like any like big concerts
00:48:39 but even just like small ones that I've gone with like friends
00:48:41 and shit
00:48:43 I enjoy listening to music
00:48:45 just and like kind of getting lost
00:48:47 in it and I feel like when I'm at a concert
00:48:49 there's like a bunch of fucking people that I hate
00:48:51 because I hate people
00:48:53 they're all around me and like people are like
00:48:55 fucking just like crowded together
00:48:57 and I mean it's fucking good
00:48:59 because like you're like fucking far away from a stage
00:49:01 and I don't know
00:49:03 the appeal of like oh it's the band
00:49:05 playing the music live I'm like I don't give a shit about the band
00:49:07 I give a shit about the music
00:49:09 so I
00:49:11 I'm the last concert I went to
00:49:13 was last year's BronyCon
00:49:15 I think that's the last time
00:49:17 and I mean that was cool and all
00:49:19 because it was a thing
00:49:21 but like now when I think about going to a concert
00:49:23 I think I would have to physically travel there
00:49:25 which is annoying I would have to buy a ticket
00:49:27 which is really annoying
00:49:29 and it would take
00:49:31 like my whole day or like my whole evening
00:49:33 which is like I just can't bear
00:49:35 I can't bear the bottom
00:49:37 let's call it what it is
00:49:39 what you're getting out of that
00:49:41 is these famous people
00:49:43 and you're going to you know socialize
00:49:45 and that's fine that's what you want to do
00:49:47 but that's what you're paying for really
00:49:49 and to hear songs that you may or may not like
00:49:51 when I go to concerts
00:49:53 it's usually because like my parents have taken me
00:49:55 or friends have taken me so I didn't have to pay
00:49:57 so in that way I'm just experiencing
00:49:59 it's the experience of like being in a huge
00:50:01 it's being in a huge stadium
00:50:03 the appeal that I find
00:50:05 is not necessarily that the music
00:50:07 is there because I can listen to it whenever
00:50:09 it's that it's just
00:50:11 being in a stadium is really cool
00:50:13 because it's all echoing really loud
00:50:15 and it is heard afterwards
00:50:17 the best concert I ever went to was
00:50:19 on my birthday
00:50:21 my buddy
00:50:23 Rich came up from New Jersey
00:50:25 is this relevant to the topic of not being able
00:50:27 to get into concerts at all
00:50:29 it is because I got into this girl
00:50:31 who I finger banged on the dance floor
00:50:33 you told the story already actually
00:50:35 did I?
00:50:37 I was able to get into it
00:50:39 Jesse why aren't you able to get into concerts
00:50:41 I want to hear everybody before I chime in
00:50:45 Jesse you still there
00:50:47 he killed himself he did
00:50:51 man that was a great joke that I could have made
00:50:53 oh there's this this girl
00:50:55 you know I'm just walking around
00:50:57 and there's so many things that are yellow
00:50:59 and none of them look like my video
00:51:03 I was waiting for it
00:51:05 no yellow thing
00:51:07 looks like my video
00:51:09 do you understand color?
00:51:11 it's not yellow it's a yellow tint sir
00:51:13 it's not even a tint
00:51:15 let's just categorically redefine
00:51:17 what yellow is so we can say the video
00:51:19 that's what you guys have been doing this whole time
00:51:23 Jesse if your lighting is yellow
00:51:25 there wouldn't everything in your room
00:51:27 be yellow by necessity
00:51:29 that's it that's it he can't see
00:51:31 yellow because he's been saturated
00:51:33 what the fuck
00:51:35 I told you there's so much thing
00:51:37 it's yellow lighting
00:51:39 there's a problem
00:51:41 in thinking about light in the way I'm describing
00:51:43 it's mostly philosophical
00:51:47 do we want to say
00:51:49 that light can be yellow
00:51:51 or do we want to say that this is what yellow is
00:51:55 I think if you were in defense
00:51:57 of yellow as a color
00:51:59 if you wanted to be a purist about what yellow is
00:52:01 then we shouldn't refer to yellow light
00:52:03 we should refer to incandescent
00:52:05 or fluorescent light
00:52:07 each of which does have its own meaning
00:52:09 and looks different however
00:52:11 not necessarily
00:52:13 a color
00:52:15 I don't know man
00:52:17 is it an insult to say that somebody's
00:52:19 video looks yellow
00:52:23 what world do we live in
00:52:25 what universe am I in
00:52:27 where the fuck am I
00:52:29 that we can even talk about this
00:52:31 why is this happening
00:52:33 why is this the world
00:52:35 does he notice the difference
00:52:37 or he would think it looks better when he has flux on
00:52:39 or I don't know
00:52:41 shut up I am not the crazy one here
00:52:43 you stupid motherfuckers
00:52:45 I am sick of being vilified
00:52:47 and treated like I'm the guy who's crazy here
00:52:49 I am not the one who's crazy
00:52:51 you are all crazy
00:52:53 when everyone else
00:52:55 everyone else in the world
00:52:57 is crazy
00:52:59 Jesse it's all
00:53:01 yes I am the only sane man
00:53:03 in a mad mad mad mad world
00:53:05 as we've clearly established multiple times
00:53:07 you have the history of this podcast
00:53:09 Jesse would you like to weigh in
00:53:11 to why you can't get into live shows
00:53:13 concerts
00:53:15 we have to make a yellow video
00:53:17 so that you can all see what a yellow video actually looks like
00:53:19 if that was gonna happen
00:53:21 who's got a thing a digi
00:53:23 I was gonna go in the opposite direction
00:53:25 I love concerts
00:53:27 I go to them all the time
00:53:29 for me it's
00:53:31 I guess because I grew up with them
00:53:33 my parents are big like metal heads and stuff
00:53:35 so I went to lots of metal shows in my teens
00:53:37 and it was always just about fucking destroying myself
00:53:39 and going ape shit
00:53:41 you know it's like
00:53:43 cause it's the loudest
00:53:45 that you could possibly listen to this music
00:53:47 and there's a bunch of other people
00:53:49 who are all into it too
00:53:51 and you're all just like
00:53:53 it's like an additional layer of
00:53:55 loud is better
00:53:57 isn't that like worse at a certain point
00:53:59 well yeah I mean
00:54:01 I think I definitely
00:54:03 I've been to a lot of shows
00:54:05 and there's definitely a huge gradient
00:54:07 of how much I enjoyed them
00:54:09 a lot of the time sound mixing is fucking terrible at shows
00:54:11 especially if you go to like a big
00:54:13 like a stadium type thing
00:54:15 usually there's
00:54:17 just not the best mixing of the audio
00:54:19 and wherever you're standing or sitting
00:54:21 you know
00:54:23 and the worst thing that can happen
00:54:25 is when you have a crowd who doesn't get the music
00:54:27 like going to
00:54:29 cause I know
00:54:31 Tom you're a big opeth fan
00:54:33 I've been to two opeth shows
00:54:35 and those guys
00:54:37 they perform perfectly
00:54:39 they sound exactly as good
00:54:41 live as they do on the album
00:54:43 they have perfect sound
00:54:45 and they'll play shows
00:54:47 but like the people who go to them
00:54:49 they have a crowd
00:54:51 and those people
00:54:53 are fucking wasted cause they're at a show
00:54:55 and so they'll be playing
00:54:57 like the heavy part of a song
00:54:59 for those who don't know opeth transitions
00:55:01 like frequently between heavy and calm parts in their songs
00:55:03 so they'll be playing a heavy part
00:55:05 and everyone's like yeah and they're all going crazy
00:55:07 and mashing and shit
00:55:09 but then they'll be like two minutes of soft
00:55:11 finger picked guitar
00:55:13 cause the average opeth songs like 10 to 15 minutes
00:55:15 so like transition back and forth
00:55:17 just kind of like doesn't really know what to do
00:55:19 cause they're all drunk and ready to fucking throw down
00:55:21 in a metal show and a lot of them are people who aren't necessarily
00:55:23 opeth fans just people who are dragged
00:55:25 by their friends and so
00:55:27 there'll always be a bunch of people talking
00:55:29 or people on their fucking like phones
00:55:31 and shit and it's like it's miserable
00:55:33 like it's such a good
00:55:35 performance that the band is putting on
00:55:37 but the crowd is so terrible at opeth shows
00:55:39 that it's like almost not worth it
00:55:41 you get a bunch of inflatable beds
00:55:43 and inflatable couches and just like
00:55:45 give everyone a bunch of weed
00:55:47 in the middle of each song
00:55:49 it seems like it really is important
00:55:51 that reminds me of my next thing
00:55:53 I can't get into
00:55:55 but the best shows I've been to
00:55:57 was it Lady Gaga
00:55:59 Lady Gaga was a fucking awesome show
00:56:01 and the best shows are the ones where the people
00:56:03 get it
00:56:05 and like everyone in the crowd seems to
00:56:07 like Lady Gaga the crowd is almost all gay people
00:56:09 and like almost all of them
00:56:11 cause I was down in the pit
00:56:13 it's all gay people who go to Lady Gaga
00:56:15 yeah
00:56:17 well no other than me and Victor were the only
00:56:19 straight guys there
00:56:21 we did not expect
00:56:23 that it was like I didn't know
00:56:25 what kind of crowd Lady Gaga pulls
00:56:27 so when I was there I was just like oh my god
00:56:29 it's all gay people and we're in the
00:56:31 the pit and everything and it slowly dawned on me
00:56:33 and then I looked down to myself and said
00:56:35 it's all gay people
00:56:37 well it slowly dawned on me
00:56:39 that everyone there
00:56:41 Lady Gaga really meant something to them
00:56:43 there's a part where
00:56:45 she had people throw
00:56:47 cause I guess she had some kind of fan club
00:56:49 and like a bunch of people took stuffed
00:56:51 animals and threw them on
00:56:53 stage at one point like I guess it was
00:56:55 something they knew was supposed to happen at this part in the show
00:56:57 and she like lays down on a couch and they throw
00:56:59 all these stuffed animals and they have letters attached
00:57:01 to them and she's like reading out these
00:57:03 letters from her fans about
00:57:05 the deep emotional connection how they
00:57:07 saved her from fucking
00:57:09 she saved them from suicide and all this shit
00:57:11 and she's like reading these letters and stuff
00:57:13 and I was like whoa this is like such a big deal
00:57:15 to the people at this show
00:57:17 but the best one I've ever been to cause I'm not
00:57:19 the biggest Lady Gaga fan it was a really
00:57:21 cool show but there's this band
00:57:23 Boris we talked about this in the
00:57:25 sleep podcast the band Boris with their
00:57:27 album flood they were doing
00:57:29 a tour where they were just playing flood
00:57:31 so like cause they have a lot of different
00:57:33 sounds they play stuff in all these different styles
00:57:35 but like it was touring for
00:57:37 that album which is a 15 year old
00:57:39 album and they were like we're doing a flood tour
00:57:41 so everyone who was there
00:57:43 knew exactly what they were in for it was
00:57:45 like a small dive bar in DC
00:57:47 everyone was a huge Boris
00:57:49 fan and we just fucking stood there
00:57:51 and like zoned out
00:57:53 to this like epic fucking
00:57:55 post rock song and I was
00:57:57 like just sitting there like with my eyes close
00:57:59 and I felt like literally like the ocean was
00:58:01 washing over me imagine
00:58:03 imagine if somehow it was in a
00:58:05 crowd where no one got it no one knew the song
00:58:07 it would be the worst performance ever
00:58:09 in terms of audience retention
00:58:11 why has it been ten minutes of
00:58:13 doom-boodly-dum-boom
00:58:15 oh no they didn't do that part
00:58:17 what's the point in that's the part
00:58:19 where you're supposed to fall asleep
00:58:21 to challenge yourself
00:58:23 there's like a lot of
00:58:25 they played a bunch of other songs
00:58:27 that weren't just flood
00:58:29 hold on here
00:58:31 for like two years I've known about
00:58:33 this concert you went to
00:58:35 you did a vlog about it when you first did it
00:58:37 and this whole time you said
00:58:39 Boris performs flood
00:58:41 and they just played flood
00:58:43 and now all of a sudden
00:58:45 more than two years afterwards you're saying
00:58:47 oh they didn't just play flood they didn't play all of flood
00:58:49 well my life is a lie
00:58:51 they cut off the first like ten minutes
00:58:53 and the last like
00:58:55 five to ten minutes of flood
00:58:57 so it's only about 45 minutes long
00:58:59 right so they cut off a lot of
00:59:01 the end in the beginning and so it was like
00:59:03 a 40 minute version of flood
00:59:05 and then they had played like five or six
00:59:07 of their dronier songs before that
00:59:09 okay that's cool but
00:59:11 Ben's got a thing to say right Ben
00:59:13 oh yes
00:59:15 D'Vu mentioned smoking weed
00:59:17 giving the crowd a bunch of weed and smoking weed
00:59:19 is something that I just cannot get into
00:59:21 hey you know by the way I was
00:59:23 asked did you ask me about what I thought about
00:59:25 concerts and then Jesse interrupted and I
00:59:27 never got back to what you think of concerts
00:59:29 and what sucks is that I had a really funny
00:59:31 line about how I've never been to a concert
00:59:33 because I live in a culturalist void
00:59:35 of humanity and it was going to be funny
00:59:37 but you've never been to like a country
00:59:39 christian no no just everyone around
00:59:41 is uncultured fucks
00:59:43 and it's ridiculous oh man yeah so
00:59:45 it's really weird I've performed a concert
00:59:47 in a church believe me D'Vu I know
00:59:49 what it's like to be surrounded by uncultured
00:59:51 fucks
00:59:55 anyways yeah alright Ben talk about
00:59:57 weed that dank 420
00:59:59 meme yeah yeah
01:00:03 can you get into the meme Ben can you
01:00:05 get into the meme at least
01:00:07 I hate the meme I've smoked it
01:00:09 I've smoked it a handful of times
01:00:11 you've smoked a handful of it
01:00:13 the sensation I've gotten from
01:00:15 a handful of times
01:00:17 and the sensation I've gotten from it has
01:00:19 been better or worse like sometimes I've
01:00:21 gotten weird and anxious and tingly and
01:00:23 felt really bad other times it's been
01:00:25 like relaxed and I've gotten in a very meditative
01:00:27 state and it's been okay fine
01:00:29 fair enough but like
01:00:31 God when the people around me
01:00:33 smoke it these days
01:00:35 these days I just have no patience for like
01:00:37 altered states of mind I want to be
01:00:39 focused all the time
01:00:41 any time I'm honestly any time
01:00:43 I'm not sitting on my computer either
01:00:45 working on drawing or
01:00:47 like trying to get myself to work on
01:00:49 drawing I'm in physical pain
01:00:51 because I should be doing I should not be doing
01:00:53 anything else nothing else is of any value
01:00:55 so when when someone is like
01:00:57 hey I'm gonna smoke weed
01:00:59 then they smoke weed and I try to be cool
01:01:01 about it but I'm just like I'm looking
01:01:03 at them like you sad motherfucker
01:01:05 this is what you want to spend your time doing
01:01:07 this is how you want your life
01:01:09 this is how you want this evening to go for you
01:01:11 and someone offers it to me I'm like haha
01:01:13 no thanks but in my mind I'm like
01:01:15 you mother for how do you know what Ben I
01:01:17 you're trying to say fucking I know
01:01:19 exactly how you feel because
01:01:21 every fucking party at some point someone
01:01:23 pulls out the doobie
01:01:25 and they all start and
01:01:27 just like you said I'm like
01:01:29 I'm like no thanks I don't want any
01:01:31 like I'm polite about it
01:01:33 but in my head I'm going I want
01:01:35 all of you to fucking die
01:01:37 how why don't you just hand me a gun
01:01:39 and say hey would you like to shoot yourself
01:01:41 with it I mean we know
01:01:43 what happens we know it goes down
01:01:45 I mean I mean I'm not saying it's
01:01:47 gonna kill you or anything I'm just saying that
01:01:49 like it's not a good thing to do
01:01:51 you know I mean I don't
01:01:53 I mean you gain pretty much nothing
01:01:55 I mean maybe stress relief I guess
01:01:57 you know I guess it's just
01:01:59 it's just a fucking juvenile thing for people
01:02:01 who have no fucking creativity
01:02:03 or no fucking ability
01:02:05 to entertain themselves and have an
01:02:07 actual conversation here's the line
01:02:09 thank you Jesse it's juvenile is fun
01:02:11 well think about this think about it this way
01:02:13 you know one of the best defenses people have for weeds
01:02:15 is that it helps soothe the pain
01:02:17 you have a terrible disease well what's your disease
01:02:19 well that's the second disease that you have
01:02:21 my disease is being
01:02:23 a man in the 21st century
01:02:25 I mean I mean
01:02:27 in this matri whatever
01:02:29 I don't want to go too hard
01:02:31 against it because like
01:02:33 I could make the same argument against any
01:02:35 recreational activity oh why are you
01:02:37 watching that movie that doesn't accomplish anything
01:02:39 you know that's stupid that's juvenile
01:02:41 like I get it you know if you enjoy
01:02:43 it fair enough but for me it's like
01:02:45 Jesse do you think you're going to have a good time
01:02:47 speaking and once you do it like
01:02:49 you're trapped in it like once you're high you're trapped
01:02:51 you have to be high for a while I hate that
01:02:53 yeah that's the scariest part by the way did I
01:02:55 ever tell you guys about the time I was physically
01:02:57 trapped like I got really high with
01:02:59 a couple people I barely knew and had one of them
01:03:01 had given me a ride that was
01:03:03 fallen to a bear trap
01:03:05 were you suing it for me did they stuff you
01:03:07 in the trunk of their car and drive you to a cliff
01:03:09 well okay really quick so me and
01:03:11 some friends I had met when I was working at Best Buy
01:03:13 a couple years ago I met this guy Aaron
01:03:15 he was okay we were hanging out one time and like
01:03:17 when I go over to his house to hang out the first time
01:03:19 he's like we're going to go drive to my
01:03:21 other friend's house he's like the coolest
01:03:23 guy in the world and so we go and we
01:03:25 drive out to that house oh my god this was
01:03:27 this was a terrible yeah it's this story it was
01:03:29 a terrible idea oh my god
01:03:31 so we go tell this alright we go all
01:03:33 the way out to his house which was like fucking
01:03:35 half an hour away and so now I'm trapped
01:03:37 he gave me the ride I can't
01:03:39 leave until he you know takes me away
01:03:41 so you know I'd smoked weed a couple
01:03:43 times before this just had a little bit
01:03:46 of experience and it had been hit or miss
01:03:48 up to this point so I meet this guy
01:03:51 you know I fuck it I'll go all out I'll
01:03:53 tell you all the details so we pull up to this guy's house
01:03:55 please please don't tell us all the details
01:03:57 please condense yeah all right I'm already
01:03:59 sick of this story you're like how old
01:04:01 for me the pooh you know what you know what
01:04:03 fuck it I mean you guys don't deserve to hear
01:04:05 this fucking story the point is okay good
01:04:07 I'm gonna I gotta think
01:04:09 I gotta sing no it's a good story you just
01:04:11 suck at telling it is I want to hear story
01:04:13 wait let's have Ben tell the story
01:04:15 Ben can't tell this fucking story doesn't
01:04:17 know anything I don't remember
01:04:19 all the details I mean you were there
01:04:21 and you did you get hired to just they
01:04:23 get okay the point is the guy that we
01:04:26 went to meet turned out he was he hyped
01:04:29 him up like this god among men and he
01:04:31 was a complete disgusting piece of shit
01:04:33 who this guy was obviously blind to like
01:04:35 a certain person I know can't see a
01:04:37 certain color this guy can't see how
01:04:39 shitty he is in real life you know sort of
01:04:41 like that like it what did this guy say
01:04:44 was cool about him well okay they had a
01:04:46 YouTube channel and I hadn't seen any
01:04:48 other content but at this point having a
01:04:50 YouTube channel was really impressive to
01:04:52 me and like I don't know he was just a
01:04:55 cool guy and he kept telling me how amazing
01:04:57 this guy was with a creative genius he was
01:04:59 and you know things of this nature but
01:05:01 anyway I meet him he's like I walk into
01:05:03 his room he's this fat fucking stoner
01:05:06 wearing no pants just like smoking from
01:05:09 a fucking he had like a vape bag sort of
01:05:12 thing and was just like he's just like
01:05:15 what's up guys and like his walls were
01:05:17 plastered with like heavy metal posters
01:05:19 that were just like covered in shit this
01:05:21 room was disgusting and the point is
01:05:24 there was nothing like what I'd been led
01:05:25 to expect and the point is we sit down
01:05:27 there's nothing to do so we all just get
01:05:28 high and I and once I get high I
01:05:32 immediately realize I go into panic mode
01:05:34 that oh my god I'm trapped here there's no
01:05:36 fucking escape what am I going to do so
01:05:37 eventually I just they started showing me
01:05:39 their videos was a fucking nightmare I
01:05:41 just eventually call I text everyone I
01:05:44 know in my phone but what were the videos
01:05:47 like um were they yellow remember I've
01:05:50 looked where they to know why are you
01:05:51 making him give more detail in the
01:05:53 story I don't know that was an
01:05:55 interesting point he described to me one
01:05:57 time and like they were really embarrassed
01:05:59 we had to watch these videos they were so
01:06:01 yellow I couldn't take it all right
01:06:06 the videos were in fact like because of
01:06:10 the context where I've been hyped up
01:06:11 that they've done all this awesome shit
01:06:13 and they were such amazing creative
01:06:14 individuals when they showed me the
01:06:16 videos it was a fucking nightmare it was
01:06:18 like and I was super high by this point
01:06:20 and I did like when I was I don't I what
01:06:22 I did was I looked around I looked at
01:06:24 these people who had nothing going on
01:06:26 their lives this is what they do with
01:06:27 their life and I think to myself this
01:06:29 is how I'm spending my life right now
01:06:31 hanging out with these people and I'm
01:06:34 trapped here I feel with everybody yeah
01:06:37 it's on this fucking planet right so the
01:06:39 point is I panic especially on this
01:06:41 podcast I texted literally everyone in
01:06:46 my phone like please call me immediately
01:06:48 that's what I texted to everyone in all
01:06:50 caps yeah like I start getting calls
01:06:53 from all my contacts on my phone because
01:06:55 my plan was I'll have someone call me
01:06:57 pretend there's an emergency and then
01:06:59 like force him to take me home
01:07:01 immediately as to get out here without
01:07:03 you know like saying anything weird so
01:07:05 like I keep getting calls and like I'm
01:07:08 pretending I'm on the phone with my mom
01:07:09 right now while I get another call
01:07:11 because I wasn't actually on the phone
01:07:13 because I just hung up on people because
01:07:14 I didn't actually want to talk to any of
01:07:16 them I was high as fuck dude I was high as
01:07:19 fuck it was a total cluster fuck and so
01:07:21 like I'm like guys I have to go my
01:07:25 sister like needs a ride to the airport
01:07:28 I have to leave now something like that
01:07:30 and the guys like oh dude we're we're
01:07:32 pretty fucked up though like we should
01:07:34 probably chill out for a little while
01:07:35 I was like okay I can survive and yeah
01:07:38 I survived for the half an hour we went
01:07:41 home got the fuck out of there it was the
01:07:43 worst experience in my life the point is
01:07:44 the weed made me super terrified super
01:07:46 paranoid was horrible don't do it yeah
01:07:49 man don't do it it has given me very
01:07:52 anxiety yeah that the anxiety is the word
01:07:54 it sometimes makes me feel really bad
01:07:58 I don't do it give go okay I have a
01:08:01 really good give boo
01:08:04 tangentially related to weed is alcohol
01:08:07 and that is a thing that I can't get into
01:08:09 sure because yeah everything I said
01:08:11 we just now also applies to out yeah
01:08:13 there's specifically getting wasted I've
01:08:15 been wasted like three times the first
01:08:17 time I was sick the second time it was
01:08:18 pretty cool but the third time I was so
01:08:20 sick so hungover that I I swore I would
01:08:23 never drink again I have drinking again
01:08:25 none of you guys have never gotten that
01:08:26 drink I've had my ups and downs with booze
01:08:29 but these days I've sort of settled into
01:08:31 a comfortable sort of I'll drink rarely
01:08:33 just to I don't know because I have a
01:08:35 silo every so often yeah and maybe a
01:08:37 glass of wine but I don't want to get
01:08:39 cups deep into my box wine right now
01:08:41 since we started the podcast I've met
01:08:43 three cups of wine I've like tried but
01:08:46 I just I don't like having my senses
01:08:48 dulled because I yeah yeah just
01:08:50 because I'm just I'm naturally anxious
01:08:52 so when I like oh my god everything
01:08:54 spinning oh yeah and then I'm just like
01:08:56 what the fuck like well I kind of like
01:08:59 being buzzed I'm just like it's hard to
01:09:01 get into drinking when there's not a
01:09:03 reason to it it feels good to be a
01:09:06 little bit buzz and to be a little bit
01:09:07 drunk like it is like relaxing and it
01:09:09 kind of can be fun but yeah before I get
01:09:12 there the thought of getting there makes
01:09:14 me anxious and I'm like I don't want to
01:09:15 I don't want to dull my senses I don't
01:09:17 think I'd ever get into alcohol as much as
01:09:19 digi well yeah I mean it's really like
01:09:23 like a it's like a practice thing for
01:09:26 comfort like I mean if you know how much
01:09:29 alcohol you can handle you can pretty
01:09:31 easily make sure you don't get to the
01:09:33 point where you're gonna fucking lose
01:09:35 your faculties and throw up yeah I know
01:09:37 exactly how many cups of wine I can have
01:09:39 before like I know how many it'll take
01:09:42 before it's a I feel like I can't drive
01:09:45 and then I know how many more it'll take
01:09:47 before I feel like I can do anything in
01:09:49 the world and that's where I need to stop
01:09:51 and if I go any further that it gets into
01:09:53 the I'm gonna feel this all fucking night
01:09:55 and I'm not gonna be able to do anything
01:09:57 so at Baronecon that last night where
01:10:01 we were all drinking for the show I
01:10:04 didn't really drink that much because I
01:10:09 didn't want to get sick you know in another
01:10:12 country smart but at the at the same time
01:10:15 I felt bad because I wasn't as crazy as
01:10:17 everyone else I was just sort of normal
01:10:19 I think I was like another thing you know
01:10:21 from everybody I was having had one drink
01:10:24 that night so we were wasted I remember
01:10:27 getting I really hate every part of like
01:10:31 the getting drunk process mm-hmm like I
01:10:33 hate the taste I hate putting it inside
01:10:35 me I hate fucking getting there I hate
01:10:37 being drunk I hate feeling the beginning
01:10:39 hungover I don't usually get hungover but
01:10:41 I hate it when it happens enough to make
01:10:43 up for all the times I don't but like the
01:10:45 only time that I actually drink a lot is
01:10:49 when I specifically want to turn into a
01:10:52 monster mm-hmm it's it's like it's like
01:10:55 the Mr. Hyde it's your doctor I was just
01:10:57 gonna say Dr. Jerry Mr. Hyde like I got
01:10:59 to let this monster out somehow or else
01:11:01 it's gonna eat me up from the inside
01:11:03 something has to happen tonight you know
01:11:05 my least favorite part of the whole
01:11:07 process is definitely the morning after
01:11:09 because oftentimes specifically when I
01:11:11 was in Japan me and my buddy Garoff would
01:11:13 go to the red light district and just
01:11:15 fucking party all night and get super
01:11:17 wasted beforehand and just be fucking
01:11:19 monsters and then the next day it would
01:11:21 just completely destroy my next day
01:11:23 because of how much I drank and how
01:11:25 irresponsibly we did it and I didn't
01:11:27 know anything about how to do it right at
01:11:28 the time you know well hangovers are a
01:11:30 well-documented phenomenon I know you know
01:11:32 it's funny to mitigate it though as did
01:11:35 you can tell you funny because the last
01:11:37 time that I got drunk
01:11:41 I got I drank an entire bottle of rum
01:11:44 I recorded a whole album that will never
01:11:46 see the light of day because it needs to
01:11:48 be destroyed it must never be seen or
01:11:50 heard by anyone I thought it was good
01:11:52 though you said it was good it's good
01:11:55 no it's but the world's not ready for
01:11:58 this kind of good yeah yeah exactly the
01:12:00 world isn't ready for it I have it can
01:12:04 you just give it to me and I'll just like
01:12:06 keep it around you can listen to it but
01:12:08 I'm not ready for the world to hear it
01:12:10 yeah okay but I just I feel like I want
01:12:13 it for myself because I hyped myself
01:12:15 after the podcast over it yeah the
01:12:18 name the album yellow the world's not
01:12:20 ready oh shit the world's not ready
01:12:22 yeah the album art is actually yellow
01:12:25 it's sure because you know it's funny
01:12:33 that uh you know you want to dwell on that
01:12:35 even though the conversation is over and
01:12:37 I've won the debate I guess you just
01:12:40 so insecure about how thoroughly I've
01:12:42 trounced you in this objective fucking
01:12:44 debate you can't handle the fact that I
01:12:46 am objectively smarter than everyone in
01:12:48 this chat combined that's so you're
01:12:50 bringing it up again out of thin air for
01:12:52 no reason you just want to keep harping
01:12:54 on it because you can't take it you can't
01:12:56 handle people are fucking colorblind
01:12:58 that you see colors that are not there
01:13:00 you see yellow but you know I was going
01:13:02 to tell a funny story about the color
01:13:04 yellow I'm not going to tell it now I'm
01:13:06 just going to let it go we lost out on the yellow story
01:13:10 that'd be in the case because you want to
01:13:12 talk about made-up yellow stories I mean
01:13:14 his yellow story is probably not going to
01:13:16 be very good anyway so oh shit yeah it
01:13:19 was I got a I got I haven't done one of
01:13:26 these things right right yeah I've been
01:13:28 letting you guys the point is I was
01:13:30 puking up stomach acid and it was yellow
01:13:32 oh holy shit that does sound like a great
01:13:36 story um is did you the last one that
01:13:39 hasn't I think yes we've gone through
01:13:41 some of you twice I haven't done any
01:13:43 is that true I have a third one oh David
01:13:45 you haven't done one hey I have plenty I
01:13:47 got a whole list baby I've got a list too
01:13:49 yeah I think this is one that probably
01:13:53 was obvious because I'm sure I've
01:13:56 mentioned it before and do you will
01:13:58 definitely know I've talked about this
01:13:59 but country music and also I'm going in
01:14:03 classical music both of them I see I
01:14:06 have heard well yeah well the thing
01:14:09 about country music and I talked about
01:14:12 this on an old podcast that like this
01:14:16 for me to enjoy something that's like
01:14:19 country ish like country influenced like
01:14:22 it becomes enjoyable to me at exactly
01:14:24 the moment it stops being country like
01:14:27 there's a lot of artists who are like
01:14:29 folk who are like country folk who I
01:14:32 like or like maybe you know have some
01:14:35 country aspects but as soon as it's like
01:14:38 country I can't take the voices I can't
01:14:41 take the southern accents like the and
01:14:43 the the mixing where it's usually like
01:14:45 very prominent vocals with these thick
01:14:47 southern accents going like honka-tonk
01:14:49 won't it don't fair you know like
01:14:52 because I mean I was my mom like
01:14:56 despises country music to an extent
01:14:59 that if she hears it for 10 seconds she'll
01:15:01 like flip shit and so like I grew up with
01:15:03 it like very ingrained in my mind that
01:15:05 country was the devil like never listen
01:15:07 to it it's the worst thing in the world
01:15:09 you know so like I have like this knee
01:15:11 jerk reaction to like a country accent
01:15:13 that's immediately like nope you know I
01:15:15 have that yeah for like just because
01:15:17 it's a terrible voice like the way that
01:15:19 they not the country accent but the
01:15:21 country music voice that y'all doing on
01:15:24 the same on the fall on the planet
01:15:26 well I mean I get I get that for people
01:15:28 who come up in a place where people talk
01:15:30 like that I guarantee you I would be
01:15:32 annoyed by it if I had a country accent
01:15:35 more than I do I would hate it I grew up
01:15:38 in Yankee country in Massachusetts and
01:15:40 there's a little bit of and I wasn't
01:15:43 really supposed to much of this at all
01:15:44 growing up but over the years I found a
01:15:46 couple of things that I'm into like like
01:15:49 like mr. Conway twitty I see the
01:15:53 sparkling little diamond in your hand
01:15:57 now he's great he's great you know this
01:15:59 when you guys watch Pokemon does Pikachu
01:16:02 just blend into the background for you
01:16:04 since everything you know you look up at
01:16:07 the sky do you see blue is there any
01:16:09 other colors up there I want to finish
01:16:12 this fucking country point of this you
01:16:15 know there's certain songs like everybody
01:16:17 loves Johnny Cash right he's like the
01:16:19 he's like the hips like if you're a
01:16:21 music hipster guy everyone says no
01:16:23 country but Johnny Cash yeah yeah he's
01:16:25 a country guy who's very acceptable to
01:16:27 like you know there's been a the needle
01:16:30 drops on a classic album review of one
01:16:32 of his things he's a you know he's popular
01:16:34 in the circuits of people who like music
01:16:36 people who ordinarily wouldn't like
01:16:38 country at all yeah and I've heard some
01:16:40 Johnny Cash songs I thought were kind of
01:16:42 okay I think he has a cool voice I like
01:16:45 his cover of Hurt by Nine Inch Nails
01:16:47 but like I can't get into even Johnny
01:16:50 Cash like I can't listen to a whole album
01:16:52 of his stuff because it's just like it's
01:16:54 just too country you know it's not that
01:16:56 country anyway like he's more even he
01:16:59 is more like blues folk rock pop fusion
01:17:02 like I mean that's what country there's
01:17:04 a large infusion of retardation and
01:17:06 very incestuous country yeah I've heard
01:17:10 some outlaw country where sometimes the
01:17:12 music's not that bad but I just can't
01:17:14 deal with the voice I've heard my ex
01:17:17 girlfriend was a huge country music
01:17:19 person like she grew up with it and all
01:17:21 she listened to was country and country
01:17:23 rock and shit and and well not only but
01:17:25 well did you the thingy terrible taste
01:17:27 in music but she played me this this
01:17:29 this album those like the soundtrack to
01:17:31 this show Nashville which is like a show
01:17:33 about musicians and like I actually
01:17:35 thought a lot of the songs on that
01:17:37 soundtrack were pretty okay but they were
01:17:39 all like folk country like they weren't
01:17:41 really country songs and the ones that
01:17:43 were country songs were terrible and it's
01:17:45 like this is this is really what I feel
01:17:47 is like the heart of what I wish this
01:17:49 podcast were and it isn't quite it's
01:17:51 because Ben will say something like I
01:17:53 can't get into this except when I can and
01:17:55 even like hippo is like I can't get into
01:17:57 drinking except that one time where I did
01:17:59 like it you see the point you made it
01:18:01 back in that very old podcast was that
01:18:03 as soon as a country song becomes good
01:18:06 to you it's also become something beyond
01:18:08 just country the definition of country
01:18:11 like what makes country its own thing
01:18:13 that makes it unique from everything
01:18:15 else is something that you do not like
01:18:17 like it like it is something that is
01:18:19 inherently shitty to you and for me that
01:18:21 is the ultimate in of an example of
01:18:23 something you just can't get into right
01:18:25 yeah I mean there's I don't want no
01:18:28 hand out living I don't want a part
01:18:30 anything they're giving I'm proud
01:18:32 even I got a song even trying to do a
01:18:35 country voice like immediately makes me
01:18:37 feel like the song must be bad you know
01:18:39 and I said a few things and I'll admit it
01:18:42 if you want to get ahead you got a hump
01:18:44 and get it I'm a white boy looking for
01:18:46 a place to do my thing
01:18:48 I won't say that I've never heard a
01:18:50 country song that I liked at all but
01:18:52 I've never heard one that I was like
01:18:54 returning to regularly you know it's
01:18:57 it's a hard genre and then also I really
01:19:00 I really resonate with I'm a white boy
01:19:02 by Merle Haggard
01:19:03 I also want to throw in classical because
01:19:06 I can't get into that either and like
01:19:08 classical at least I can appreciate the
01:19:10 compositions and be like yeah that's
01:19:12 that I mean I understand the emotions
01:19:14 that that's supposed to evoke but I don't
01:19:16 like the sound of classical instruments
01:19:18 it's soundtrack music so of course you
01:19:21 know it's like it's not necessarily
01:19:23 something you can get into as much and
01:19:24 we're not talking like a song that plays
01:19:26 in a movie we're talking the background
01:19:28 music that's going on during a scene and
01:19:31 it's like you'll have a scene of a guy
01:19:33 not classical classical like Mozart wasn't
01:19:36 a backing track you're thinking of
01:19:38 orchestral it's different than yeah
01:19:40 no is it most classical music like set to
01:19:42 certain plays no I'm pretty sure about
01:19:45 that they wrote them to be stories in and
01:19:47 of themselves yeah Beethoven and Mozart
01:19:50 and fucking what's this fuck are none of
01:19:52 them are well you know I don't think
01:19:54 anybody actually listens to classical
01:19:56 music everyone just says they do
01:19:57 wait a second how many of you know I know
01:19:59 some of the dais like half that movie is
01:20:01 like people playing classical music and
01:20:03 there's a play going on to it and he's
01:20:05 posing it for the play what's going on if
01:20:07 I've been lied to I'm a dais is the
01:20:09 greatest musical I mean movie of all
01:20:11 time some things yeah well a lot of it is
01:20:15 like that like whether or not it's
01:20:19 not about whether or not it's soundtrack
01:20:21 music I just don't like the sound of the
01:20:23 instruments I don't like classical
01:20:25 instruments I don't like orchestral
01:20:26 music at all that's right I know
01:20:28 orchestral music that's way too broad a
01:20:30 category all of the people I know who are
01:20:32 into that kind of stuff are like only
01:20:34 into that stuff like it's all people who
01:20:36 like play classical instruments and are
01:20:38 only into those that kind of me know I
01:20:40 don't like any orchestral music with that
01:20:42 is very few exceptions I don't believe
01:20:44 a couple of anime soundtracks I think are
01:20:46 pretty yellow is the best classical sound
01:20:48 but it's a rock and roll sort of guy
01:20:50 thing what yellow electric like
01:20:53 electric light or orchestra oh yeah
01:20:55 okay but they're like a electronic
01:20:58 they're got like no that they're
01:21:00 electronic slash classical right but as
01:21:03 soon as you put electronic elements in
01:21:05 there it's no longer just or well you
01:21:07 said you didn't like the sound of the
01:21:08 instruments well I mean I don't like them
01:21:10 like I love the violin I think the
01:21:13 violin sounds great in the background
01:21:16 of a rock or pop song like I don't want
01:21:18 to just listen to a violin unless it's
01:21:20 like a like one exception being like the
01:21:23 opening song on Agilosh do you like
01:21:25 you're lying April did you go well
01:21:27 first of all I dropped that show after
01:21:29 one episode there you go garbage
01:21:31 you didn't get to the music okay just
01:21:33 checking yeah um no I I mean I watched
01:21:35 all of or most of no dime a cantabile
01:21:37 and like I appreciate the musical
01:21:40 performances they're well directed and
01:21:42 they're good they are good pieces of
01:21:44 music I would never listen to them of my
01:21:47 own accord like I've tried countless
01:21:49 times to put on like you know everyone
01:21:51 loves Moonlight Sonata right that's
01:21:53 everybody's intro to classical song and
01:21:55 I put it on I feel nothing you know it's
01:21:58 okay I'm like I don't think yeah
01:22:00 whatever all right fine I accept that
01:22:02 you don't like it fair enough I just
01:22:04 want to say that the idea that like a
01:22:07 lot of the things we're saying like we
01:22:10 we can't get into them except that one
01:22:12 time I think that's mainly because like
01:22:15 we're all basically quite open-minded
01:22:17 and that we can enjoy we can get into a
01:22:20 lot of things in a small way yeah I
01:22:22 object to your objection to do that makes
01:22:24 perfect sense it wasn't an objection it
01:22:26 was just like an observation that we're
01:22:28 all talking about things that we like
01:22:30 once but most of the time not I mean like
01:22:32 I don't come I don't hate everything
01:22:34 about Dungeons and Dragons like there
01:22:36 are parts of it that I think are fun and
01:22:38 cool it's just that I think on the whole
01:22:40 the experience of it is generally well
01:22:42 as long as we're clarifying previous
01:22:44 things we've said and as long as we're
01:22:46 airing our grievances I want to go back
01:22:48 to the yellow thing for justice just a
01:22:50 minute I'd rather you go back to the
01:22:52 hope stuff because now what are we
01:22:54 going to do
01:22:56 you muting me doesn't have anything to
01:22:58 do how do you how does you muting Jesse
01:23:00 doesn't really help
01:23:02 go on Jesse
01:23:04 I still hear Jesse
01:23:06 someone for yourself I didn't know that's how that worked
01:23:08 yeah you dumbass you fucking
01:23:10 idiot
01:23:12 wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute
01:23:14 no don't finish your point I want to hear what
01:23:16 makes you think that you have authority over
01:23:18 who mutes Jesse anyway first of all
01:23:20 that you think that you can do that is stupid
01:23:22 and that you think the perfectly rational reason
01:23:24 for thinking that alright there's two reasons
01:23:26 first of all when I muted you for a second
01:23:28 ago there was a mute symbol next to you
01:23:30 that's identical to what it looks like
01:23:32 if someone mutes themself second of all
01:23:34 I gave everyone
01:23:36 I gave everyone here like absolute moderator
01:23:38 admin powers and I'm the one who owns
01:23:40 the chat oh I never accepted
01:23:42 them okay stop trying to
01:23:44 we're talking about yellow here let me defend myself
01:23:46 you ripped on me for not knowing
01:23:48 why I can delete anyone's
01:23:50 comments we can all delete one another's sentences
01:23:52 just fucking sit down
01:23:54 shut up Jesse I'm going to tell you
01:23:56 I can delete anyone's messages
01:23:58 and anyone can so I thought it seemed
01:24:00 very likely that I can use someone else
01:24:02 okay Davoo you make that
01:24:04 Davoo we weren't bashing on you for
01:24:06 Jesse was
01:24:08 Jesse was
01:24:10 it's the fact that you thought
01:24:12 that you were allowed to do that
01:24:14 the light blue is quite uniform
01:24:16 it's orange
01:24:18 it's not quite yellow
01:24:20 it is kind of yellow
01:24:22 okay I just wanted to clarify
01:24:24 for everybody because I said before
01:24:26 that the issue was not
01:24:28 whether or not my video looks
01:24:30 good the issue is that whether or not it looks
01:24:32 yellow see there's actually two issues
01:24:34 there they're both separately on their own
01:24:36 they're both very valid issues that I
01:24:38 that I take grievance with
01:24:40 first of all it doesn't look yellow it's not yellow at all
01:24:42 but I didn't mean to imply
01:24:44 that the other issue is not important
01:24:46 the video absolutely looks beautiful
01:24:48 that fucking Christmas video
01:24:50 it looks gorgeous it looks beautiful
01:24:52 I don't know what the hell you think
01:24:54 there is no Jesse video I would describe
01:24:56 as gorgeous I don't know what you think
01:24:58 gorgeous is then I don't know what you think
01:25:00 gorgeous is then because my videos
01:25:02 you know I'm the best fucking director
01:25:04 I'm the best at fucking framing a scene
01:25:06 setting up a shot hey if you want to see something
01:25:08 gorgeous why don't you head on over to
01:25:10 saintcomics.com and have a look at some of my
01:25:12 fucking bullshit my camera is HD
01:25:14 okay you're all giving me shit like my camera quality
01:25:16 now you know once I beat you in one
01:25:18 subject you jump ship to the next subject
01:25:20 and try to start a whole new thing
01:25:22 my camera quality is great
01:25:24 that's not true Tom and I both brought it up
01:25:26 okay so I was
01:25:28 right about the yellow it's not yellow I was right about
01:25:30 how beautiful my videos look they are beautiful
01:25:32 I was right about the camera quality
01:25:34 my camera is great so you guys are just fucking wrong
01:25:36 about everything and every time I catch you
01:25:38 in the act of being wrong you jump ship
01:25:40 to something else
01:25:42 just to clarify what you're doing right now
01:25:44 is you're just grabbing other arguments and attaching
01:25:46 them to your main one as to give it more
01:25:48 validity no no these are all separate arguments
01:25:50 that I'm right each one by themselves
01:25:52 alright well Jesse you're right about everything
01:25:54 DeVue what the fuck
01:25:56 no no no no see see see that's another
01:25:58 that's another sick tactic that you people use
01:26:00 okay you try to brush me off
01:26:02 there's no way out there's no way out of this conversation
01:26:04 what answer would you like
01:26:06 Jesse I would like you all to do
01:26:08 what answer could you possibly want
01:26:10 sorry, I catch this
01:26:12 there's no exit
01:26:14 there's no exit
01:26:16 Rollin, rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollink saja
01:26:28 DeVue what the fuck
01:26:31 raisins I've never been able to 이렇게
01:26:36 Okay, look, here it is. Here's the thing about raisins, right?
01:26:38 I think the taste of raisins...
01:26:40 I think the taste of raisins is all right.
01:26:42 Do you like grapes? Do you like grapes?
01:26:44 This just shut up, Nate.
01:26:46 First of all, Nate, I know what you said about grapes.
01:26:48 I can also like...
01:26:50 I know what you said about grapes.
01:26:52 I also like orange juice,
01:26:54 but I don't like rotten orange juice
01:26:56 that's been out in the sun for five days.
01:26:58 So here's the thing about raisins, right?
01:27:00 The taste is so-so.
01:27:02 I suppose orange juice is yellow, too, right?
01:27:04 Sometimes.
01:27:06 Is that why it's called fucking yellow juice?
01:27:08 I'm...
01:27:10 I'm starting to get on board with this banning Jesse idea.
01:27:12 Like, raisins are like...
01:27:14 Good! I hope you ban me!
01:27:16 I hope you all ban me! This is my hill to die on!
01:27:18 Go on, DeVoe.
01:27:20 Keep power through. I'll never let this go.
01:27:22 All right.
01:27:24 I kicked him out of the call, so...
01:27:26 Oh, you... you don't like...
01:27:28 He said he's never gonna give up,
01:27:30 and we have to finish the podcast.
01:27:32 Uh...
01:27:34 I care more about his hilarious argument
01:27:36 than I do about your taste of raisins.
01:27:38 That was a little bit... much.
01:27:40 Is he not even in this chat anymore?
01:27:42 Oh, man. You really stepped over the fucking line.
01:27:44 What did you do?
01:27:46 I thought I was just gonna kick him out of the call.
01:27:48 I didn't kick him out of the group.
01:27:50 You clearly don't know anything about the rules
01:27:52 in the fucking thing.
01:27:54 I'm not the one who derailed this podcast five times.
01:27:58 You are the one who completely...
01:28:00 Dude?
01:28:02 No, I'm honestly glad that he's gone,
01:28:04 but I still wouldn't kick him.
01:28:06 I have to figure out how to get him back in here now.
01:28:08 Oh, my God.
01:28:10 This is not good.
01:28:12 Uh, fuck.
01:28:14 These fucking raisins are tearing us apart!
01:28:16 Like, okay, we're gonna need to get
01:28:18 constantly shouting,
01:28:20 where the fuck is the end right now?
01:28:22 Stop talking about this.
01:28:24 I take action to solve that problem,
01:28:26 and everyone thinks it's weird.
01:28:28 Our friendship is shriveling under the hot yellow sun.
01:28:32 Yeah, well, here's...
01:28:34 Does anyone have an invite link for this shit?
01:28:36 I got it. I got the link. I'm trying to find...
01:28:38 Yeah, I have...
01:28:40 You should still be friends with him,
01:28:42 or if you go to, like, the top direct messages.
01:28:44 But now all we're gonna be talking about
01:28:46 is how I kicked him out.
01:28:48 And again, I thought I was just kicking him out of the call.
01:28:50 We can cut it, dude. We can cut it. It's not a big deal.
01:28:52 No, we can't. It's funny.
01:28:54 This is pretty funny, honestly.
01:28:56 I want him to be able to listen to this.
01:28:58 Oh, man.
01:29:00 Jesse, if you're listening to this, I'm sorry, dude.
01:29:02 As soon as he enters the call,
01:29:04 all he's gonna talk about is me kicking him.
01:29:06 Here's my...
01:29:08 I think that Jesse was going way too hard
01:29:10 on this yellow thing, but I also think
01:29:12 that this is like...
01:29:14 Yeah, I wouldn't... I mean, I don't know.
01:29:16 I'm a centrist.
01:29:18 Sure, fine.
01:29:20 You realize...
01:29:22 Jesse, I didn't realize I was gonna kick you out of the chat.
01:29:24 Right? You realize the mistake
01:29:26 that you just made.
01:29:28 You have just made this fire
01:29:30 so much worse
01:29:32 than you ever could have imagined.
01:29:36 When you beat Jesse to low on HP,
01:29:38 he only comes back stronger.
01:29:40 Yeah, it's like final fantasy 8.
01:29:42 You realize...
01:29:44 that it is now my mission to derail
01:29:46 every podcast with the subject
01:29:48 until the end of time.
01:29:50 All you had to do, DeVoo, was just move Jesse
01:29:52 to the other voice channel.
01:29:54 It would have had the same effect.
01:29:56 You guys just aren't happy
01:29:58 with any actual executive action
01:30:00 taking to fix this problem.
01:30:02 Because this crusade is over...
01:30:04 Because this is all a funny act thing.
01:30:06 It's hilarious that we're
01:30:08 derailing the podcast and arguing about yellow.
01:30:10 It's the funniest thing in the world.
01:30:12 Now, if we don't...
01:30:14 Where do you draw the line here?
01:30:16 I was getting pretty tired, honestly.
01:30:18 Kicking him was hilarious,
01:30:20 but it's also hilarious because it was incompetent.
01:30:22 It's not yet begun to become tired, Ben.
01:30:24 It's not yet begun
01:30:26 to become tired.
01:30:28 You people are going to
01:30:30 beg me for mercy by the time
01:30:32 this is done.
01:30:34 I will keep this going for months.
01:30:36 I'll keep this going for years
01:30:38 if I have to. By the time I'm through
01:30:40 with you, you will
01:30:42 beg. You will weep.
01:30:44 You will...
01:30:46 You will...
01:30:48 You will beg me to accept
01:30:50 that it's not yellow.
01:30:52 Do you understand?
01:30:54 You will be like Theon Greyjoy.
01:30:56 Please cut my finger off.
01:30:58 Please cut it off, Ramsay.
01:31:00 Like Theon fucking Greyjoy.
01:31:02 Just cut it off.
01:31:04 I'm mostly...
01:31:06 At this point, I'm also mostly laughing
01:31:08 at the thought that DeVu
01:31:10 was so
01:31:12 campaigning to make Jesse be quiet.
01:31:14 It kicked him out so that he could talk about
01:31:16 racism.
01:31:18 It's not true.
01:31:20 You guys were constantly telling him
01:31:22 to shut up.
01:31:24 You just created your own monster, DeVu.
01:31:26 You just created a nightmare.
01:31:28 Turn into a mural on the Sistine Chapel.
01:31:30 This event, you know, should be immortalized.
01:31:32 I was going to do it regardless of who needed to talk at the moment.
01:31:34 It was like the fourth time we derailed it.
01:31:36 It wasn't because of me at all.
01:31:38 Do you know what it feels like
01:31:40 to be betrayed, to be abandoned
01:31:42 by your friends, to be kicked out to the curb?
01:31:44 To DeVu.
01:31:46 To DeVu.
01:31:48 Do you know
01:31:50 the rage
01:31:52 that you were exhuming a man?
01:31:54 Oh no!
01:31:56 You're finally free.
01:31:58 You know what it's like to leave the Bork, don't you?
01:32:00 That's a death sentence right there.
01:32:02 Yeah, no, Jesse finally had sweet escape
01:32:04 and as soon as I gave him a
01:32:06 leash back in, he immediately jumped on it.
01:32:10 He was like,
01:32:12 put me back in for another round.
01:32:14 For what it's worth,
01:32:16 I kind of want to hear why DeVu can't get into me too.
01:32:18 Me too. Me too?
01:32:20 We have this ten minute delay between me actually explaining it.
01:32:22 The texture is gross.
01:32:24 It feels like I'm eating a bug. That's it!
01:32:26 That's all I had to say.
01:32:30 I like raisins,
01:32:32 they're sweet, and that's it.
01:32:34 I don't like them in muffins, they're annoying.
01:32:36 They taste like candy.
01:32:38 I don't like candy, I just like
01:32:40 the majority of candy my entire life.
01:32:42 I guess I should have said that.
01:32:44 Why didn't you bring that up?
01:32:46 You know what I was thinking,
01:32:48 this whole podcast, I know that
01:32:50 all the things I can't get into
01:32:52 for real, I'm not even going to be able to think about them
01:32:54 because I just haven't even
01:32:56 thought about them in so long.
01:32:58 But yeah, candy, as a kid,
01:33:00 and I like slightly more candy
01:33:02 as an adult than as a kid.
01:33:04 Just almost all of them.
01:33:06 I can only think of some candy I can tolerate
01:33:08 with a laughing taffy.
01:33:10 Do you like sweet food in general?
01:33:12 Yeah, totally, just candy is disgusting.
01:33:14 I have friends who just don't like sweet food,
01:33:16 so I was just wondering.
01:33:18 What do you mean when you say candy?
01:33:20 Candy is very specific.
01:33:22 Like anything you'd buy at a candy store.
01:33:24 Because we call them sweets in general.
01:33:26 Candy is a specific thing.
01:33:28 Like a Reese's or a chocolate bar,
01:33:30 or like a...
01:33:32 Well here, to go into like
01:33:34 anything sweet,
01:33:36 I can kind of like.
01:33:38 The fact that it is candy is the biggest detriment
01:33:40 against liking it, you see.
01:33:42 For example, one candy bar I do kind of like
01:33:44 is Take Five. I don't even know if that's still in production.
01:33:46 It's called Take Five.
01:33:48 It's got stuff in it that I like.
01:33:50 But the fact that it's this tiny
01:33:52 really processed
01:33:54 with tons of preservatives thing
01:33:56 makes it vastly inferior
01:33:58 to just getting some pretzels and chocolate
01:34:00 and peanut butter and layering that
01:34:02 and putting that in an oven. That would be vastly preferable.
01:34:04 The opposite. I like everything
01:34:06 more when it's processed.
01:34:08 I've come to realize, I can't home make any snacks
01:34:10 that don't taste good.
01:34:12 To make it, you should experiment with the cooking.
01:34:14 It's the best. Feels great, tastes great.
01:34:16 You're trying to recreate candy bars
01:34:18 at home. It never works.
01:34:20 That's true.
01:34:22 How would you recreate a chocolate bar?
01:34:24 Chocolate melts in general.
01:34:26 And then you unmelt it.
01:34:28 Hershey's chocolate.
01:34:30 Hershey's chocolate just tastes like it came out of a can.
01:34:32 Hershey's chocolate is pretty gross.
01:34:34 I've heard of Hershey's just
01:34:36 in like
01:34:38 Hershey's
01:34:40 chocolate kisses are just like disgusting
01:34:42 for some reason.
01:34:44 M&M's
01:34:46 are hell on earth.
01:34:48 I just can't stand M&M's or the grossest thing
01:34:50 because they also feel like I'm eating a bug
01:34:52 because they got that shell that feels like
01:34:54 the exterior of a bug.
01:34:56 I love M&M's.
01:34:58 That's all this conversation is doing for me right now.
01:35:00 Well see
01:35:02 here's the depressing part for me.
01:35:04 I grew up loving candy
01:35:06 especially Reese's
01:35:08 and as I grew older
01:35:10 taste wise I could
01:35:12 eat more candies.
01:35:14 The stuff I didn't like when I was a kid
01:35:16 like almonds or stuff like that, I don't care.
01:35:18 Any candy, it tastes good.
01:35:20 But I take one
01:35:22 fucking bite of candy
01:35:24 and not only do all of my teeth hurt
01:35:26 but I can't drink anything afterwards
01:35:28 and my mouth tastes like sugar
01:35:30 and it just ruins my whole fucking throat.
01:35:32 As soon as I take a bite of candy
01:35:34 I want to die immediately.
01:35:36 You should get some work done on those teeth dude.
01:35:38 Every once in a while
01:35:40 I'll go to the supermarket
01:35:42 and buy an entire box of
01:35:44 gushes and then open a pack
01:35:46 and just scoop the entire pack
01:35:48 and scoop the whole pack of gushes into my mouth.
01:35:50 And then do the same thing
01:35:52 and then do the same thing with every other pack
01:35:54 in the box.
01:35:56 Pack a box of gushes in my mouth
01:35:58 and just let the gooey juice
01:36:00 just squeeze so much.
01:36:02 Did you guys ever turn
01:36:04 fruit by the foot into just a jawbreaker?
01:36:06 Hell yeah!
01:36:08 Dude, I would squeeze it into a thing.
01:36:10 Any of those fruit by the foot or like the
01:36:12 fruit roll-ups I would just mash them into a ball
01:36:14 and take little junk bites out of it.
01:36:16 I eat them and that's tasty
01:36:18 but I just feels wrong
01:36:20 after I ate it.
01:36:22 Well they are wrong, I love it.
01:36:24 As a kid as well.
01:36:26 Why did I eat that?
01:36:28 That wasn't like a satisfying experience
01:36:30 overall.
01:36:32 For me it's not about satisfaction
01:36:34 it's about physical pain.
01:36:36 All of my teeth will scream at me.
01:36:38 I have a filling in every tooth in my mouth
01:36:40 and they don't take kindly to that shit.
01:36:42 It's sad.
01:36:44 It's really sad because
01:36:46 as an adult I can afford as much candy as I want.
01:36:48 I can go to the store and just buy all of them
01:36:50 if I wanted to and it will mean nothing to me.
01:36:52 I kind of get the same thing.
01:36:54 For some reason lately
01:36:56 chocolate has been making my teeth.
01:36:58 I think I probably just have a cavity.
01:37:00 There is a way to get
01:37:02 chocolate that I enjoy
01:37:04 which is bags of chocolate chips
01:37:06 and you just do something with that.
01:37:08 That's just a Hershey kiss but smaller!
01:37:10 The thing though, the thing about that
01:37:12 is that that's
01:37:14 literally not true at all.
01:37:16 It's a completely different taste.
01:37:18 When I think of chocolate
01:37:20 the taste of chocolate chips is exactly what
01:37:22 even if it's Hershey's
01:37:24 chocolate chips is not as milky.
01:37:26 It's a totally different taste.
01:37:28 It's way better of course.
01:37:30 I don't know how this works
01:37:32 but if you put chocolate chips into cookies
01:37:34 and then you bake the cookies so the chocolate chips are melted
01:37:36 but then they get unmelted because the cookies
01:37:38 cool off
01:37:40 the chocolate tastes a million times better
01:37:42 now that it's been infused with the cookie.
01:37:44 I do like sweet things and bakery and stuff
01:37:46 but anything that comes out of a wrapper
01:37:48 is just inherently gross.
01:37:50 That's interesting.
01:37:52 Now you can get into that.
01:37:54 If that's wrapped it up
01:37:56 I wait
01:37:58 I have one more thing
01:38:00 I don't know if I should bring it up.
01:38:02 I was planning to wrap the whole podcast.
01:38:04 I just want to move on to the next one.
01:38:06 I have like one other thing.
01:38:08 I have a book for like three hours
01:38:10 I have so many topics left over
01:38:12 since I was
01:38:14 since I was on ceremony
01:38:16 Let me do mine.
01:38:18 Let me do mine.
01:38:20 I really hope that this is not off base
01:38:22 for the tone of the podcast
01:38:24 but the thing that I cannot get into
01:38:26 is the gender non-binary.
01:38:28 Okay.
01:38:30 And when I say that
01:38:32 it probably sounds like I'm antsy.
01:38:34 You can't get into it because you
01:38:36 tried on the dress
01:38:38 and it just wasn't working for you.
01:38:40 When I say that I can't get into that
01:38:42 it probably sounds like I'm transphobic
01:38:44 or something. I'm not.
01:38:46 I respect people's right
01:38:48 to be treated the way they want
01:38:50 and to express themselves the way they want
01:38:52 and I wouldn't tell anyone that they can't do
01:38:54 I'm transphobic. I hate trans people.
01:38:56 I hate them all.
01:38:58 But there is this idea
01:39:00 that some people have
01:39:02 in like that community
01:39:04 and like when they try to express what it is
01:39:06 about being like non-cis or trans
01:39:08 they'll say like
01:39:10 I am a woman on the inside
01:39:12 like spiritually I am a woman
01:39:14 like I am biologically
01:39:16 a man but I feel like a woman
01:39:18 and I don't know what that means
01:39:20 and I don't think they know
01:39:22 either because I don't think
01:39:24 there is any specific feeling
01:39:26 like being a man or being a woman
01:39:28 I think that is
01:39:30 what they probably mean is that I want
01:39:32 to look and act this way
01:39:34 and I think that's fair but when they kind of put this
01:39:36 weird sort of almost mystical twist on it
01:39:38 like it's what it is inside me
01:39:40 I have to be like that doesn't mean
01:39:42 well hang on Ben let me ask one
01:39:44 I really think that the whole issue
01:39:46 honestly comes down to
01:39:48 definitions and words
01:39:50 I really think in my heart of heart
01:39:52 that it is at its core a semantical issue
01:39:54 of how you define the word gender
01:39:56 possible
01:39:58 and therefore because it is a semantic issue
01:40:00 I find the whole thing kind of boring
01:40:02 and pointless
01:40:04 hang on I've got a really important thing to ask about that
01:40:06 because I have heard something that might
01:40:08 be an issue with that now I'm pretty much with you
01:40:10 on all that but I have heard when I've been
01:40:12 you know reading about this stuff
01:40:14 I have heard that there is an argument
01:40:16 that there is a real biological difference
01:40:18 between the male and female brain
01:40:20 and some people contend that they have
01:40:22 the wrong brain for what
01:40:24 their you know like their body is
01:40:26 now I have not really looked into it but I've heard
01:40:28 that it's legit a little bit maybe
01:40:30 I think that that claim
01:40:32 I mean I don't know the studies
01:40:34 I haven't read the studies but I think that on an
01:40:36 individual basis that claim
01:40:38 I have the wrong brain is impossible
01:40:40 to back up
01:40:42 what I think is that even if it were the case
01:40:44 even is even your brain
01:40:46 the definition like imagine if someone had
01:40:48 imagine if a white guy had like
01:40:50 the kind of nose that
01:40:52 black people tend to have a little bit more often
01:40:54 would you say I have a black nose or would you just say
01:40:56 that
01:40:58 necessarily the black nose
01:41:00 you would have to research what if there was a difference between
01:41:02 necessarily the female brain
01:41:04 if one male person can have the same patterns
01:41:06 as that female brain
01:41:08 then is it necessarily the female brain
01:41:10 you know that's what it is
01:41:12 what it is
01:41:14 what it is
01:41:16 what it is
01:41:18 what it is about the brain
01:41:20 thing is that it's
01:41:22 the average so the male average
01:41:24 brain acts in a certain way
01:41:26 okay I'm with you on that
01:41:28 there's actually three genders
01:41:30 Pinky Elmira and the brain
01:41:32 okay
01:41:34 okay hold on
01:41:36 I've got one thing to say about this first
01:41:38 the last thing you said was an important thing
01:41:40 what's this one now
01:41:42 get it all out at once
01:41:44 okay because Ben said that such a thing is
01:41:46 unquantifiable but because it is
01:41:48 unquantifiable I say it is impossible to back up
01:41:50 on an individual if that's the case
01:41:52 then don't we kind of have to take their word for it
01:41:54 when they say that
01:41:56 I didn't say we shouldn't
01:41:58 no look okay
01:42:00 but let me say my thing I think you would do
01:42:02 because I'm
01:42:04 part way with you on this but for me
01:42:06 I am not into
01:42:08 labels at all
01:42:10 I think the problem is
01:42:12 I think the problem is people making a big deal
01:42:14 out of being male or female
01:42:16 or any gender just be you
01:42:18 you guys know about gloom gender
01:42:20 just be whatever you are
01:42:22 and it doesn't need a name
01:42:24 it doesn't need a title you don't have to make it
01:42:26 a thing just be you
01:42:28 and if you want to act
01:42:30 a way that does not
01:42:32 match up with what your genitals are
01:42:34 then just act that way
01:42:36 there is a strange
01:42:38 dichotomy in the thinking
01:42:40 of trans allies
01:42:42 and the lgdb community
01:42:44 which I cannot wrap my head around
01:42:46 and the duality is that on the one hand
01:42:48 they say that gender
01:42:50 is merely performative
01:42:52 they define gender to be merely performative
01:42:54 and a social construct fair enough
01:42:56 on the other hand they then
01:42:58 you know they have
01:43:00 you know they want to they choose one
01:43:02 or the other like I am this
01:43:04 I identify as this but if it is a social construct
01:43:06 and a performative thing
01:43:08 why must you then
01:43:10 why must you then slot into one
01:43:12 that is an excellent point Ben I have yet to hear a defense of that
01:43:14 my whole thing
01:43:16 with definitions and names and boundaries
01:43:18 of where the words begin and end is
01:43:20 what's the most useful
01:43:22 because like I understand
01:43:24 it doesn't matter what's useful or not
01:43:26 people will come up with whatever they want
01:43:28 when you think about stuff like
01:43:30 gay, straight, bi or asexual
01:43:32 I feel like
01:43:34 which sexuality you have
01:43:36 you can sort of at least round it up
01:43:38 it's a better example to make my point
01:43:40 that you can round it up
01:43:42 or round it down into one of those four
01:43:44 and those terms are useful
01:43:46 if say you are at a party
01:43:48 or a bar or whatever and someone wants to know
01:43:50 whether or not they can hit on you or something like that
01:43:52 fuck that
01:43:54 just tell them individually
01:43:56 I am or am not attracted to you
01:43:58 it doesn't have to be I'm bi
01:44:00 or I'm gay or I'm straight
01:44:02 I don't like you get the fuck away from me
01:44:04 that could be more useful but
01:44:06 there are plenty of other
01:44:08 circumstances where you need
01:44:10 words to shorten down
01:44:12 what you are, like digi is the
01:44:14 otaku ganzo journalist
01:44:16 those are three labels right there
01:44:18 Jesse is the old school fool
01:44:20 those are different terms
01:44:22 I came up with a new name for you
01:44:24 you are the home school fool
01:44:26 with that home school cool
01:44:28 Tom what were you trying to say
01:44:30 actually what Nate just said is great
01:44:32 because people say home school
01:44:34 but there is such a huge grade
01:44:36 and good old Ben he is that home stuck fuck
01:44:38 with that home stuck suck
01:44:42 I will gladly
01:44:44 I will gladly take off
01:44:46 what Nate brought up with home schooling
01:44:48 because there are so many different kinds
01:44:50 it really doesn't necessarily say anything
01:44:52 about how that person was raised
01:44:54 but here is the thing
01:44:56 the term home school does mean
01:44:58 that you were taught by your parents
01:45:00 probably at home as a term
01:45:02 and there is no concrete definition to it
01:45:04 but that term is useful
01:45:06 I can't just begin
01:45:08 but who cares about the fact that you were home school
01:45:10 other than you just feeling like
01:45:12 well for example when we need to talk
01:45:14 about it like in the last podcast
01:45:16 and what if I began
01:45:18 my talking about it
01:45:20 my commentary by saying
01:45:22 by like trying to like in three paragraphs
01:45:24 describe exactly what my situation was
01:45:26 that would have been perfect
01:45:28 hold on did he not at all
01:45:30 because this is how I used to communicate
01:45:32 I would like try to explain all the details
01:45:34 before like explaining what the overall
01:45:36 reality was
01:45:38 you don't have to do it before or you can do it later
01:45:40 no I did it that way and you complain
01:45:42 that whenever I begin talking about something
01:45:44 you don't know what I'm talking about until I'm
01:45:46 toward the end of my point so I'm like oh
01:45:48 this is what we need words for
01:45:50 I don't think home school counts as a label
01:45:52 I don't think that's the same thing as what I'm describing
01:45:54 you say home school people think of certain things
01:45:56 but they'll probably be inaccurate
01:45:58 but it does mean
01:46:00 like you weren't schooled in a building
01:46:02 you were probably schooled by your parents
01:46:04 it means certain things
01:46:06 necessarily even though everyone is on some sort of weird
01:46:08 gradient
01:46:10 I began my commentary on the last podcast
01:46:12 I was home schooled that lets people get
01:46:14 some context into what I'm talking about
01:46:16 and then I can elaborate later but not everyone
01:46:18 can know exactly what you mean
01:46:20 let Tom say his thing
01:46:22 I think the reason though
01:46:24 that people get hung up
01:46:26 on the label with
01:46:28 trends and all that kind of stuff is because
01:46:30 it's not it's because they want to feel
01:46:32 part of a community
01:46:34 because
01:46:36 that whole kind of like there's this huge kind of
01:46:38 collectivist ideology
01:46:40 deep in the root of social justice
01:46:42 whatever you want to identify that as
01:46:44 it's very much a collectivist ideology
01:46:46 so they don't really
01:46:48 did you you're making a great point I agree with you
01:46:50 because I'm an individualist but they're not individualist
01:46:52 like they classify themselves
01:46:54 isn't individualist a label
01:46:56 and that's one of the problems I have
01:46:58 I think with the whole
01:47:00 kind of like trans movement
01:47:02 I guess is that because what they do
01:47:04 is they'll say like I want to be a woman
01:47:06 or I want to be a man but then they make
01:47:08 a big deal about the trans label so now we
01:47:10 have male female trans male and trans
01:47:12 now we have four things instead of trying to
01:47:14 just transition from one to the other
01:47:16 so you that
01:47:18 plus for identity is making it more
01:47:20 more complicated instead of just simplifying
01:47:22 it because by putting so much emphasis
01:47:24 on that
01:47:26 that's true the social
01:47:28 the social and community aspect must
01:47:30 complicate the issue
01:47:32 this also comes down to because I
01:47:34 made this exact same argument on an episode of Digi Bros
01:47:36 before the one I was making earlier
01:47:38 and you know some of the responses were saying
01:47:40 well you know
01:47:42 in the name of getting people to
01:47:44 understand what the fuck
01:47:46 this thing is having labels
01:47:48 is helpful and I get that
01:47:50 it's just that
01:47:52 DeVu has accused me of this before
01:47:54 that I always seem to go right for the biggest
01:47:56 possible picture as opposed to
01:47:58 what is individually relevant right now
01:48:00 because in my mind I'm wanting
01:48:02 everyone to not care about labels
01:48:04 anymore forever
01:48:06 just all people all over the world
01:48:08 and I was going to say like if you never
01:48:10 if you're one of these people who's you know
01:48:12 got their own fractured you know gender identity
01:48:14 or whatever like you're like do we just need
01:48:16 to make labels for everybody because there's always
01:48:18 going to be somebody who doesn't fit isn't
01:48:20 it better to just shoot for we all kind of just
01:48:22 you know we live in our own shit
01:48:24 that's the real solution
01:48:26 was themselves and everyone else
01:48:28 didn't question it and just accepted it
01:48:30 but obviously
01:48:32 we're not in that world and it's
01:48:34 it's going to take a while and like you know
01:48:36 a lot of people won't get what you're doing
01:48:38 if you're like acting one gender
01:48:40 that is not the one that you seem to be
01:48:42 you know people won't get that so I get
01:48:44 I get why the labels exist I'm just saying that
01:48:46 as an idealist
01:48:48 who wants to live in a world where everyone's
01:48:50 just a fucking weirdo that's my dream of the
01:48:52 perfect reality is that everyone
01:48:54 is totally fucking weird
01:48:56 that's my perfect world
01:48:58 is that every person I see
01:49:00 and I'm like what the fuck is that guy
01:49:02 that's awesome
01:49:04 what is that
01:49:06 guy is not a gendered term
01:49:08 yeah guy is just a name for the coolest guy
01:49:10 I'm a dude, he's a dude, she's a dude
01:49:12 we're all dudes yeah
01:49:14 the same applies for guy
01:49:16 but you can't even do this example
01:49:18 without saying he and she
01:49:20 like you can't even like make any progress
01:49:22 they're just entrenched in our language
01:49:24 whatever did this podcast become
01:49:26 I like the better one you were arguing about
01:49:28 yellow
01:49:30 I sure didn't
01:49:32 and I just want to close out my point by saying
01:49:34 that again it's not about
01:49:36 what anyone does or chooses to do
01:49:38 I think everyone should be free to do whatever they want
01:49:40 it's only some of the reasoning
01:49:42 behind it that when
01:49:44 explained I think when someone says
01:49:46 I am actually a woman
01:49:48 or I'm a woman on the inside
01:49:50 I don't think that necessarily means anything
01:49:52 I think that there's a thing
01:49:54 I close out I guess
01:49:56 I've always kind of thought
01:49:58 it's kind of insolvable with this kind of mentality
01:50:00 maybe just no one's explained it to me good enough
01:50:02 is that you have people saying
01:50:04 I'm a woman on the inside because
01:50:06 there's differences between men and women
01:50:08 and I'm a woman trapped in a man's body
01:50:10 but those same people also say
01:50:12 all the time
01:50:14 it's arbitrary
01:50:16 it's socially defined
01:50:18 gender norms are bullshit
01:50:20 so if there's differences
01:50:22 then you're either saying
01:50:24 I just kind of made that point
01:50:26 I think while you were standing up
01:50:28 he did
01:50:30 I can totally get
01:50:32 relating to and identifying more strongly
01:50:34 with a traditionally feminine
01:50:36 societal role
01:50:38 that makes sense to me
01:50:40 being a woman on the inside
01:50:42 feeling like a woman on the inside
01:50:44 does not make sense to me
01:50:46 I think you have a very funny definition of the phrase
01:50:48 things I can't get into
01:50:50 just to close out people
01:50:52 everybody go watch
01:50:54 are we closing out or do we not have more
01:50:56 do you guys want to do more
01:50:58 I didn't get to say anything in this podcast
01:51:00 we will do more but let me just say
01:51:02 because I wanted to just say digi
01:51:04 I have a beautiful vision of what you were saying
01:51:06 would look like and what is Imaishi's current show
01:51:08 that's going on with the alien girl
01:51:10 Luluko
01:51:12 Space Patrol Luluko is the perfect ideal of this
01:51:14 I gotta talk
01:51:16 Matthew Matosis into cutting this
01:51:18 one ten minute chunk out of his four hour live stream
01:51:20 at E3 where he was just on this
01:51:22 like epic rant about
01:51:24 how space should be fucking chaos
01:51:26 he was like
01:51:28 everytime I play a game about space
01:51:30 I can't do his accent
01:51:32 everytime he plays a game about space
01:51:34 it's always just like normal
01:51:36 it's always human stuff
01:51:38 it's always humans fighting humans
01:51:40 if I go out into space everything should be fucking crazy
01:51:42 I just want to walk up to somebody and be like
01:51:44 oh my god what the fuck is that
01:51:46 and he just went on this long rant about it
01:51:48 that was awesome
01:51:50 it was the best thing I ever heard
01:51:52 Jesse you were agreeing with him
01:51:54 oh ok I get it I'm with you
01:51:56 Matthew Matosis
01:51:58 tell me your sins boy
01:52:00 oh father
01:52:02 father Matosis
01:52:04 your sins
01:52:06 he's definitely
01:52:08 I can't get into Matthew Matosis guys
01:52:10 Jesse what's the thing you can't get into
01:52:12 that's not true I can
01:52:14 old comics
01:52:16 comics
01:52:18 yeah like silver age
01:52:20 bronze age
01:52:22 shut up
01:52:24 yeah
01:52:26 iron age
01:52:28 shut the fuck up god damn it
01:52:32 he's getting steamed now folks
01:52:34 I'm gonna
01:52:36 I'm gonna ban you
01:52:38 I'm just gonna talk to myself
01:52:40 that's the ideal scenario
01:52:42 I'm really interested in this though
01:52:44 because I've always been curious about whether
01:52:46 comic fans like old comics
01:52:48 I figured Jesse would be into the golden age
01:52:50 because of what got
01:52:52 ok
01:52:54 shut the fuck up
01:52:56 alright Jesse go on
01:52:58 I don't know what you were getting at with that
01:53:00 so in the 1980s
01:53:02 Frank Miller
01:53:04 Alan Moore
01:53:06 and Grant Morrison all got together
01:53:08 and said what if comics were good
01:53:10 and they made
01:53:12 and they wrote Arkham Asylum
01:53:14 they wrote The Killing Joke and Watchmen
01:53:16 they wrote Daredevil and Wolverine
01:53:18 and all those great comics
01:53:20 and suddenly comics were good forever for all time
01:53:22 it was the greatest medium
01:53:24 in the history of art
01:53:26 but before that
01:53:28 every comic was trash
01:53:30 all of them from the golden age
01:53:32 silver age and bronze age
01:53:34 I tried to
01:53:36 anything pre 1980s and even some comics
01:53:38 from the 1980s
01:53:40 I tried to read them
01:53:42 I'm like I want to read these old stories
01:53:44 and I just fucking
01:53:46 I see the art
01:53:48 and I see the giant retarded word balloons
01:53:50 and it's just like
01:53:52 Jesse are you telling me that Stan Lee
01:53:54 is not the greatest creative genius who ever lived
01:53:56 I don't think Stan Lee actually
01:53:58 created anything
01:54:00 I think he's kind of a con man
01:54:02 kind of
01:54:04 except that one time he cosplayed his liquid ocelot
01:54:06 that was pretty dope
01:54:08 he's great it's not his fault
01:54:10 it's just
01:54:12 his time was an era
01:54:14 bereft of talent
01:54:16 the paradigm was
01:54:18 to make bad comics
01:54:20 I've always wondered about
01:54:22 it's all about the generational evolution
01:54:24 where the kids grow up on something that sucks
01:54:26 but they can appreciate
01:54:28 what is the potential about it
01:54:30 and they spend all their time wanting to make it better
01:54:32 and they become adults and they take it to the next level
01:54:34 that's what happened with film
01:54:36 I'm gonna piggyback on Jesse's thing
01:54:38 and say I can't get into old
01:54:40 anything
01:54:42 as soon as it's passed a certain threshold of age
01:54:44 it's just
01:54:46 I think that what Jesse just described
01:54:48 with the comic creators getting together
01:54:50 and saying what if comics were good
01:54:52 I think that has happened in every
01:54:54 medium where
01:54:56 with movies like the oldest movies I really
01:54:58 can get into are like the 70s
01:55:00 which is when the movie brat
01:55:02 generation came around
01:55:04 when Kane did you
01:55:06 I don't think they actually
01:55:08 had a meeting and said that
01:55:10 I made that story up
01:55:12 I don't think the movie brats did either
01:55:14 but my point is that
01:55:16 there was a period in the 70s
01:55:18 where a bunch of people who were like these
01:55:20 big time film buffs
01:55:22 who were big fans of film
01:55:24 who were educated in film specifically
01:55:26 as opposed to
01:55:28 this was just what Nino was talking about
01:55:30 in his fucking Miyazaki video
01:55:32 in the 70s and the 60s
01:55:34 anime creators
01:55:36 were all people who were like
01:55:38 doctors and stuff
01:55:40 people who had come from other fields
01:55:42 referencing a Nino video
01:55:44 it's a new world we're in now
01:55:46 Nino was talking about how
01:55:48 these creators
01:55:50 of the older anime were not
01:55:52 like anime fans
01:55:54 they were influenced by other works of art
01:55:56 but then when
01:55:58 you got Gainax coming into the fold
01:56:00 and stuff like that
01:56:02 they were inspired specifically by anime
01:56:04 not exclusively
01:56:06 Anno has made a huge point
01:56:08 about how the fact that he thinks everyone is just influenced
01:56:10 by anime these days and it's a problem
01:56:12 but
01:56:14 I think that those are the people who
01:56:16 Miyazaki or does Anno say that too
01:56:18 Anno says it too
01:56:20 but I think that
01:56:22 there's certain periods where people who are
01:56:24 into a medium
01:56:26 and who clearly care deeply about it
01:56:28 can sort of recognize what's good about it
01:56:30 like better than
01:56:32 perhaps the people who actually made the stuff
01:56:34 right? because everyone's just kind of
01:56:36 like if you're making something
01:56:38 new that's never existed before
01:56:40 then it's more about
01:56:42 how to make it cost effective
01:56:44 how to make it something that is
01:56:46 capable of being done
01:56:48 like how do we even make
01:56:50 an anime happen
01:56:52 and then the people who come later
01:56:54 look at all those anime and they go like
01:56:56 this this and this were the best episodes of
01:56:58 Astro Boy so what if we copied those
01:57:00 elements and made a show like that
01:57:02 as opposed to throwing
01:57:04 100 episodes worth of ideas
01:57:06 at a wall only some of which will stick
01:57:08 and so I think that every
01:57:10 medium
01:57:12 inherently gets better over time because people can
01:57:14 look at the old stuff and say
01:57:16 they can cut out the stuff that didn't work
01:57:18 and they can put in new stuff that does work
01:57:20 here's my counter
01:57:22 wait you don't say that about video games
01:57:24 here's my
01:57:26 I would say that about video games
01:57:28 video games from the fucking 70s were garbage
01:57:30 you want to fucking play Pong?
01:57:32 I totally disagree with that
01:57:34 Digi because in my humble opinion
01:57:36 anything that is old
01:57:38 or recycled or reincorporated
01:57:40 is automatically a lesser version
01:57:42 of the original
01:57:44 well I completely disagree
01:57:46 I like Quentin Tarantino more than any of the directorcy copies
01:57:48 the fact that
01:57:50 new movies might take something
01:57:52 an old movie did and do it
01:57:54 quote unquote better
01:57:56 but the fact that they're not the first one to do it
01:57:58 makes it less valuable
01:58:00 I totally and completely disagree
01:58:02 I think being the first one actually makes
01:58:04 is a sad weakness
01:58:06 like you were the first one
01:58:08 you're a fool bro
01:58:10 those people deserve all the respect
01:58:12 in the world
01:58:14 they just have by the sad fact of being
01:58:16 first have made the worst product
01:58:18 this is getting like way beyond
01:58:20 what I originally was talking about
01:58:22 I just think that specifically
01:58:24 with old comics
01:58:26 you're right we were talking about comics
01:58:28 I totally co-opted
01:58:30 Jesse's problem
01:58:32 I look at old comics
01:58:34 and the artwork looks derpy
01:58:36 it all looks like this weird
01:58:38 homogenized 60s style
01:58:40 I think everyone knows what I'm talking about when I talk about old comic book art
01:58:42 and the stories
01:58:44 are always so wordy
01:58:46 the characters are describing everything they're doing
01:58:48 and they're just a pain in the ass to read
01:58:50 they're just not well written
01:58:52 or well conceived even
01:58:54 and not even just
01:58:56 like that the stories themselves are bad
01:58:58 most of them are pretty far out
01:59:00 and weird and wacky
01:59:02 but not necessarily bad it's just
01:59:04 like they didn't have anything
01:59:06 they didn't know what good was yet
01:59:08 it's like
01:59:10 well they were for kids back then
01:59:12 yeah like nowadays
01:59:14 like those three guys that I said
01:59:16 Frank Miller and Alan Moore and Grant Morrison
01:59:18 every comic ever
01:59:20 nowadays is influenced so heavily
01:59:22 by the books they wrote in the 80s
01:59:24 that they kind of
01:59:26 made comics something completely different
01:59:28 than they originally were so it's almost like
01:59:30 a whole different thing that I'm talking about
01:59:32 when I'm talking about old comics
01:59:34 and I feel the same way
01:59:36 about like TV anime
01:59:38 with Ava were like
01:59:40 and all the anime that was good
01:59:42 in like the 80s was either like
01:59:44 the world masterpiece theater show
01:59:46 which meant it was based on an old novel
01:59:48 or it was like directed by
01:59:50 these very few certain directors
01:59:52 who were doing like good stuff
01:59:54 but none of it was anything close to what
01:59:56 Ava did and like Ava created
01:59:58 the idea of original TV anime
02:00:00 and the directing
02:00:02 was so much better
02:00:04 in my opinion I mean there's plenty of people
02:00:06 who will actually kill me
02:00:08 for saying that
02:00:10 Anno is better than Osamu Dazaki
02:00:12 or something but like I watch those old shows
02:00:14 and what I see is an 80s anime
02:00:16 and when I watch Evangelion
02:00:18 I do not see 1995
02:00:20 I see
02:00:22 like the best anime I've ever seen
02:00:24 you know
02:00:26 yeah but I mean okay
02:00:28 we've made new anime since Ava so it's obviously
02:00:30 not the best anymore you know
02:00:32 there you go
02:00:34 in that one specific instance it might have been done
02:00:36 like way better but in general
02:00:38 it's not better just because it was done again
02:00:40 I just think that I think
02:00:42 when you take something
02:00:44 when you take something old
02:00:46 and you subtract all the shitty parts
02:00:48 and just tighten up the good parts
02:00:50 and then enhance it
02:00:52 with your own extra creative edge
02:00:54 it's a better product
02:00:56 it depends on what like that's so vague
02:00:58 it's totally vague it's all about the artistic
02:01:00 it's the individual artistic product
02:01:02 you can judge it by whether or not it's better or not
02:01:04 if they didn't enhance it then it's not going to be a better product
02:01:06 it depends on what these so called shitty parts
02:01:08 if something is good
02:01:10 then I like it
02:01:12 if something is good then I like it
02:01:14 what the fuck
02:01:16 it doesn't matter how old it is
02:01:18 I like old things
02:01:20 I like new things I like
02:01:22 Ben what if there's a movie
02:01:24 where like the whole
02:01:26 thing is amazing
02:01:28 but there's this one part where they left in
02:01:30 like this like just
02:01:32 lame ass ten minute
02:01:34 like two characters taking
02:01:36 a poop or something like except not
02:01:38 that hilarious
02:01:40 something dumb
02:01:42 that happens in the middle of the movie
02:01:44 and then someone later
02:01:46 like if in Citizen Kane they just two characters
02:01:48 started doing battle shits in the middle of it
02:01:50 for like yeah
02:01:52 I'm trying to think of an example that wouldn't
02:01:54 make the movie better
02:01:56 let's put it this way
02:01:58 what if you took Citizen Kane and made
02:02:00 the same concept but now it has battle
02:02:02 shits in it it's a better movie
02:02:04 fucking Kane
02:02:06 Kane and his wife
02:02:08 are sitting across the long table in the
02:02:10 Xanadu fucking farting at each other
02:02:12 you can't just add
02:02:14 bullshit to an old thing and then it's like
02:02:16 apparently a better artistic piece
02:02:18 God fucking damn it
02:02:20 I want you to prove yourself here
02:02:22 because I want you to like list off
02:02:24 all your favorite stuff at some point
02:02:26 figure out if it's clearly all new stuff
02:02:28 I will list off my favorite
02:02:30 things at some point when we do
02:02:32 the people versus Ben St
02:02:34 like isn't like
02:02:36 isn't Homestuck like your favorite thing of all time
02:02:38 that's super new and it's super built on the
02:02:40 backs of like every other art medium
02:02:42 ever created if video games
02:02:44 hadn't existed you couldn't have that
02:02:46 everything's built on the back of something
02:02:48 but everything that's great about Homestuck
02:02:50 is the way that it fucking innovated
02:02:52 and did things that no one had ever done before
02:02:54 do you think that the video game
02:02:56 parts of Homestuck are inherently
02:02:58 not as good as Pong
02:03:00 because they weren't the first video game
02:03:02 is that what you're saying
02:03:04 okay look let me
02:03:06 counter that if there had never been
02:03:08 a video game ever if video games
02:03:10 did not exist and then you were
02:03:12 reading Homestuck and you hit
02:03:14 that next button and suddenly you were having
02:03:16 an interactive experience
02:03:18 let's discuss the reality
02:03:20 let's discuss the reality we live in
02:03:22 Ben
02:03:24 let's discuss the actual reality we live in
02:03:26 where things are constantly getting iterated
02:03:28 making a fucking thought experiment
02:03:30 digi
02:03:32 like of course that would be the case
02:03:34 but that's not the case
02:03:36 so
02:03:38 Ben you need to understand the difference between
02:03:40 the point is that newness is valuable and precious
02:03:42 you're talking about stuff that is
02:03:44 impressive like the amount of
02:03:46 wow that is so much more
02:03:48 new it's not the same as being
02:03:50 better
02:03:52 I think newness
02:03:54 there is definitely inherent
02:03:56 like an inherent goodness
02:03:58 to newness
02:04:00 but I don't think that that
02:04:02 goodness exceeds the goodness of
02:04:04 being better
02:04:06 but you're judging better by
02:04:08 doing it again with other shit
02:04:10 like there has to be
02:04:12 which is what everything is
02:04:14 everything after the original
02:04:16 is just doing the same thing
02:04:18 but better
02:04:20 I like things that are
02:04:22 good
02:04:24 much better
02:04:26 a vastly superior thought experiment
02:04:28 imagine Pong came out today
02:04:30 you'd be like oh
02:04:32 I can't get into Pong honestly
02:04:34 I just can't
02:04:36 it beeps and it boops
02:04:38 Pong is just
02:04:40 tennis
02:04:42 that proves my point too
02:04:44 because if it came out today
02:04:46 it wouldn't be good but back when it was new
02:04:48 because it was the first fucking video game
02:04:50 it was good
02:04:52 and now it sucks
02:04:54 do you want to play Pong?
02:04:56 is Pong your favorite video game?
02:04:58 no no one gives a fuck about Pong
02:05:00 it's not good anymore
02:05:02 I give a fuck about Pong
02:05:04 on the PS1 version
02:05:06 the remake
02:05:08 it had value
02:05:10 and was impressive
02:05:12 and people wanted it
02:05:14 it was
02:05:16 it was
02:05:18 it's not even was
02:05:20 as we know
02:05:22 and it continues to be noteworthy
02:05:24 no no no worthy yes
02:05:26 it is very noteworthy
02:05:28 it deserves
02:05:30 all the respect in the world
02:05:32 doesn't make it the best video game
02:05:34 this all came out of my topic somehow
02:05:36 I'm so sorry
02:05:38 here is why Ben is wrong
02:05:40 than anyone even gives him credit for
02:05:42 as we know from that PlayStation 3 commercial
02:05:44 our grandmothers
02:05:46 played by having
02:05:48 a hoop with a stick
02:05:50 and kicking that around
02:05:52 grandmothers played by getting raped
02:05:56 they got raped in the back of a Cadillac
02:05:58 after prom
02:06:00 people were bored as shit
02:06:02 all the time
02:06:04 people had very little stimulus
02:06:06 to go on compared to what we have now
02:06:08 and now those people are old
02:06:10 and they just sit in their houses
02:06:12 doing nothing
02:06:14 forever when we are old
02:06:16 it's not going to be like that
02:06:18 when we are in our 80s
02:06:20 we're just going to be marathoning shows and videos
02:06:22 and playing video games all the time
02:06:24 I like to think I'll still be drawing right up until I'm in the ground
02:06:26 but you'll also be doing this other shit
02:06:28 we are into so much more stuff
02:06:30 like in 1997
02:06:32 a kid playing Final Fantasy 7
02:06:34 is enjoying himself
02:06:36 way more
02:06:38 on average probably
02:06:40 than most of the biggest, most fanatic
02:06:42 fans of pawn
02:06:44 we are having more fun
02:06:46 relative
02:06:48 but there's also a time
02:06:50 relativity here
02:06:52 life is objectively better
02:06:54 today than it was in the 1800s
02:06:56 but happiness is not up
02:06:58 because of your happiness
02:07:00 overall is compared to everything else around you
02:07:02 the medical technology we have today
02:07:04 gives you
02:07:06 you should read
02:07:08 there's a fantastic chapter of One Piece
02:07:10 during the Marine Corps
02:07:12 I thought you were going to recommend a self-help book
02:07:14 if that's pretty much what it is
02:07:16 in which
02:07:18 this is my favorite podcast
02:07:20 we've ever done by the way
02:07:22 in which
02:07:24 Don Quixote, Do Flamingo
02:07:26 does this grand young speech
02:07:28 what does Don Quixote have to do with this
02:07:30 Jesse, I'm talking about One Piece
02:07:32 in which this guy who's a really powerful pirate
02:07:34 makes up grand speech during this war
02:07:36 in which the fate of the world is at stake
02:07:38 about
02:07:40 when you're poor
02:07:42 like little things
02:07:44 become much more valuable to you
02:07:46 and if you're rich and entitled
02:07:48 then losing even the small thing
02:07:50 is a proportionally much bigger deal
02:07:52 and that our happiness
02:07:54 is contextual on our experiences in life
02:07:56 well thank god One Piece exists
02:07:58 to give us that philosophical truth
02:08:00 imagine if Nate were
02:08:02 a marriage counselor
02:08:04 we just keep fighting all the time
02:08:06 what should we do
02:08:08 well I've seen chapter 375
02:08:10 of One Piece
02:08:12 one piece taught me how to be a real human being
02:08:14 I'm imagining
02:08:16 Nate in a church
02:08:18 he's in a big church and there's stained glass windows
02:08:20 and they've all got the crew members
02:08:22 of the going
02:08:24 Mary on them and he pulls out
02:08:26 he's like today we'll be reading from
02:08:28 chapter 537
02:08:30 One Piece is my bible dude
02:08:32 page 15, panel 7
02:08:34 and Frankie said
02:08:36 SUPER
02:08:38 SUPER
02:08:40 we sing that shit
02:08:42 we have all the medical advances we have today
02:08:44 where our bodies on average get to feel
02:08:46 a whole lot less pain
02:08:48 and misery than we did before
02:08:50 but your happiness overall might be
02:08:52 the same as it was in the 1800s
02:08:54 but here's the thing
02:08:56 the amount of pain you have in your body
02:08:58 is a different variable to evaluate your standard of living
02:09:00 and your happiness is a totally separate variable
02:09:02 so like a kid from the 70s
02:09:04 could go out and have the same amount of
02:09:06 time of fun playing
02:09:08 Pong as a kid from the 90s
02:09:10 would go out and play Pong like it's the same
02:09:12 amount of fun it's just that the kid
02:09:14 in the 70s has so
02:09:16 few alternatives to go to
02:09:18 beyond Pong whereas a kid from today
02:09:20 playing Pong could enjoy it just as much
02:09:22 but we'll choose to do it
02:09:24 less because there's better alternatives
02:09:26 so they'll walk away
02:09:28 from playing Pong going it wasn't
02:09:30 really worth it because I could just play
02:09:32 Final Fantasy 7 and have a much better time
02:09:34 whereas from the 70s kid he'd be like
02:09:36 oh it was a great time there's nothing better to do
02:09:38 so that is why
02:09:40 even at the time it wasn't worth it
02:09:42 you just didn't have the ability to feel
02:09:44 how much better it is now
02:09:46 putting aside the whole issue of like whether or not
02:09:48 you know like audio-visual
02:09:50 stimulus is necessarily better than like real life stuff
02:09:52 I agree I agree
02:09:54 alright who else has a
02:09:56 thing to think into
02:09:58 I've got one that's an extension
02:10:00 of one that you of yours
02:10:02 Digi what was that
02:10:04 Country Song
02:10:06 and this is it's just
02:10:08 music all music
02:10:10 music in general I can't get into it
02:10:12 and I'll tell you why
02:10:14 I'm kinda with you
02:10:16 it's not that I don't like music
02:10:18 because when I listen to music often times I enjoy
02:10:20 it immensely and you've recommended a lot of stuff
02:10:22 that I really liked
02:10:24 I always thought you were a lot more into music
02:10:26 I know Ben isn't into like
02:10:28 anything he's mentioned
02:10:30 Ben's less so than me
02:10:32 yeah see that's the thing
02:10:34 I like music when I get to it
02:10:36 the problem is I don't have a place in my life
02:10:38 for music
02:10:40 and that's really what I'm talking about
02:10:42 there's no point in my life
02:10:44 when I have a place where I can just put on music
02:10:46 like you Jesse, I mean you Digi
02:10:48 you just listen to music like all the time
02:10:50 is what you've always said
02:10:52 it's just always playing in the background
02:10:54 I like when I'm editing
02:10:56 I don't want to be listening to music
02:10:58 because I need to hear the audio stuff
02:11:00 I have to edit in silence
02:11:02 you know there's a
02:11:04 you just open up your music player
02:11:06 you start playing an album
02:11:08 with no vocals
02:11:10 and you turn the volume down on the music player
02:11:12 to like 20%
02:11:14 that's not gonna be good enough
02:11:16 it's gotta be quieter than the music of your video
02:11:18 and it will not interrupt anything
02:11:20 I promise you
02:11:22 I don't want to just put music on the background
02:11:24 I actually am enjoying listening to it
02:11:26 see well that there's your problem
02:11:28 because I have recently found a place
02:11:30 for music in my life
02:11:32 which is I put on some like
02:11:34 soothing vapor wave
02:11:36 chill wave, simpsons wave
02:11:38 vapor wave is like a seal wave
02:11:40 and you put and I put it on
02:11:42 and it has to be of a particularly low tempo
02:11:44 sort
02:11:46 and I put it on and it's just atmospheric
02:11:48 and I leave it on and if the music is
02:11:50 non-distracting enough then I can just sit
02:11:52 and like either write
02:11:54 or sketch or ink
02:11:56 or tone or whatever
02:11:58 while I have it on
02:12:00 just because yours doesn't involve audio at all
02:12:02 but my work does so you know it's
02:12:04 I don't think it interrupts
02:12:06 my work involves audio too
02:12:08 you're gonna tell me what interrupts my work
02:12:10 you're gonna tell me how I should be editing
02:12:12 I'm just saying you haven't tried it
02:12:14 I haven't tried it with like super chill music
02:12:16 I mean I think if you're just syncing up like
02:12:18 the key is to use
02:12:20 to go and find the music to play
02:12:22 I have to download it, I have to put it on loop
02:12:24 I have to see if I like it
02:12:26 just listen to everything on YouTube
02:12:28 everything's on there
02:12:30 what I do is like
02:12:32 all the music I listen to is contextual
02:12:34 it's like if I feel
02:12:36 I always say that I love my beautiful
02:12:38 dark twisted fantasy but I can only listen to it
02:12:40 if I'm drunk and depressed
02:12:42 that's the situation where that album is perfect
02:12:44 if I'm editing videos
02:12:46 it's like one of a few
02:12:48 instrumental calming
02:12:50 electronic albums
02:12:52 or if I'm trying to
02:12:54 get myself hyped for editing it's on a monoguchi
02:12:56 if it's like
02:12:58 if I'm in a mood where I just want to thrash stuff
02:13:00 I put on some metal
02:13:02 if I'm in a mood where I just want to chill I put on some chill music
02:13:04 you know what this is
02:13:06 I don't view or use music that way
02:13:08 I like view an album as like an art piece
02:13:10 I need to sit there for an hour and study
02:13:12 and appreciate it
02:13:14 it is like the first time you listen to it
02:13:16 the first 25 times you listen to it
02:13:18 but I listen to albums hundreds of times
02:13:20 I don't got the space to listen to it for the first time
02:13:22 you know I'm not trying to like
02:13:24 tell anyone I'm just telling you what my life is
02:13:26 and like why
02:13:28 let me break in with a brief anecdote
02:13:30 the other day I was finishing up my high work submission
02:13:32 and I was
02:13:34 inking in some sketches of the characters
02:13:36 from my new comic
02:13:38 and I was thinking about
02:13:40 what the story is
02:13:42 what the main themes of the story are
02:13:44 and I realized
02:13:46 as I was drawing this I hadn't even realized it before
02:13:48 I realized that what the series is actually about
02:13:50 in my mind
02:13:52 is the quest to be happy
02:13:54 and how to be happy
02:13:56 and I was inking in
02:13:58 that character, that really cool looking character
02:14:00 that I didn't show anyone else but I posted in the thing
02:14:02 and on my playlist
02:14:04 Pharrell's happy came on
02:14:06 and I was so struck
02:14:08 by like drawing that character
02:14:10 while listening to that song
02:14:12 I felt like
02:14:14 not like I was emotional
02:14:16 like I was crying, I was just so like
02:14:18 amped up, I was so like in the moment
02:14:20 it's so hard for me to imagine
02:14:22 this feels so right
02:14:24 it's so hard for me to imagine you who's like the biggest hipster I know
02:14:26 getting all emotional over like
02:14:28 the biggest song of the last five years
02:14:30 I'm sorry
02:14:32 no
02:14:34 here's a terrible thing about me Digi
02:14:36 I hate popular media
02:14:38 and when things are popular
02:14:40 it makes me hate them and yet I really
02:14:42 I often find myself
02:14:44 really really responsive to like
02:14:46 huge hits and things that are massively popular
02:14:48 like I fucking love
02:14:50 I think it's an amazing song
02:14:52 and I can't, I wish I didn't
02:14:54 I wish I hated that
02:14:56 it was a feel good hit of the summer
02:14:58 and I was just sitting there
02:15:00 just like twitching
02:15:02 it's all
02:15:04 coming together, it all feels
02:15:06 like it's all in place
02:15:08 Nate I will say, I will agree with you
02:15:10 that like if I was editing or
02:15:12 if I was even writing a script
02:15:14 I would by no means listen to music
02:15:16 that I haven't heard before
02:15:18 that is not the right, unless it was
02:15:20 unless it was like
02:15:22 if you're hearing it for the first time
02:15:24 you can very easily go on YouTube
02:15:26 and type like
02:15:28 chill wave mix
02:15:30 and it'll just be like a two hour mix
02:15:32 of like a bunch of shitty electronic music
02:15:34 that's really generic
02:15:36 is like perfect
02:15:38 listen to any trance mix
02:15:40 they all sound exactly the same
02:15:42 let's go to YouTube and search for funk
02:15:44 and just jam the fuck out for a while
02:15:46 I've been listening to some great chill wave mixes
02:15:48 that are by some guy named
02:15:50 I think Epicuros
02:15:52 and they start off with a scene
02:15:54 from Blade Runner where he gives the
02:15:56 the what's it test to Rachel
02:15:58 and uh
02:16:00 I don't know
02:16:02 that's how I feel about all vaporwave
02:16:04 other than like Blank Banshee
02:16:06 which I legitimately love
02:16:08 most vaporwave to me is extremely
02:16:10 disposable and not memorable
02:16:12 and not interesting
02:16:14 there are some
02:16:16 upbeat energetic
02:16:18 vaporwave songs that actually get me kind of pumped
02:16:20 I've heard the, cause there was that
02:16:22 sailor wave, that hour long mix
02:16:24 that Nate had posted
02:16:26 and the whole thing is like
02:16:28 one hour long funk song
02:16:30 it's like the same song over and over again
02:16:32 and you can get the point within
02:16:34 20 seconds and that's the
02:16:36 entire thing and I just put it on
02:16:38 for an hour and I didn't pay any attention to it
02:16:40 I was doing work and doing other shit but like
02:16:42 it fit well you know
02:16:44 it's not something I would ever listen to
02:16:46 as like a let's sit down and listen to
02:16:48 sailor wave for an hour
02:16:50 whereas I would do that for like
02:16:52 like a Kendrick Lamar album
02:16:54 like that's not music you can have on in the background
02:16:56 you really have to sit and listen to
02:16:58 to Pimpa Butterfly if you want to get
02:17:00 that album you know
02:17:02 I have two vaporwave mixes that I
02:17:04 listen to a lot one is called Neo Batavia
02:17:06 and the other is called
02:17:08 Squad Goals
02:17:10 and they both, they both
02:17:12 have like a couple of songs on there that are like
02:17:14 Squad Goals is the one I was talking about actually
02:17:16 not Sailor Wave
02:17:18 Oh yeah, the one that plays
02:17:20 when like the looping gif of the
02:17:22 Doraemon characters walking
02:17:24 Squad Goals is the mix with like the
02:17:26 tons of anime shit in it right
02:17:28 it's like a heavy
02:17:30 the video is like a heavily processed
02:17:32 thing of like an old anime
02:17:34 it looks all the videos
02:17:36 it's really cool because I know all those shows
02:17:38 and for me like my favorite thing about
02:17:40 vaporwave is all these 80s
02:17:42 anime that no one's heard of suddenly
02:17:44 like surfacing in media and I'm like
02:17:46 oh my god people are making videos about fucking
02:17:48 Cobra and shit like this is the best
02:17:50 there's a there's a YouTube channel called
02:17:52 Artsy Music and there is a
02:17:54 like ARTZie
02:17:56 and there's one
02:17:58 there's a song by Lord Son and the name
02:18:00 is in Japanese but like
02:18:02 it's this looping gif of I forget
02:18:04 her name the character from Gun Buster
02:18:06 Oh yeah that's Noriko
02:18:08 Yeah Noriko from Gun Buster
02:18:10 I know the video you're talking about
02:18:12 Dude, yeah that bit of animation where like
02:18:14 she's well it's not just
02:18:16 the tip bounce like she stands up and like
02:18:18 she like she has her mouth open
02:18:20 and then she closes her mouth and blinks twice
02:18:22 and as she's doing it she closes her fists
02:18:24 and like twists her arms inwards into
02:18:26 like a triumphant pose I have
02:18:28 watched that loop and I
02:18:30 watched that animation like like for
02:18:32 10 minutes straight and I would just like
02:18:34 try to blink at different moments in it
02:18:36 to like pick out the different frames
02:18:38 and like until I had like
02:18:40 developed like a feel for every
02:18:42 individual frame in that like several
02:18:44 second animation you know what you gotta do now
02:18:46 you have to watch because that that
02:18:48 specific cut is
02:18:50 in daikon 4 and it's in otaku
02:18:52 no video like it's a cut that they kept
02:18:54 reusing in uh in gynax so
02:18:56 like because it was a
02:18:58 act according to your definition band
02:19:00 that makes Gun Buster worse
02:19:02 well it's all the same guy it's all
02:19:04 Toshio Kata wrote all of those
02:19:06 Recycled idea
02:19:08 No it makes the other things that it was
02:19:10 recycled into worse
02:19:12 Well it was originally
02:19:14 It was first daikon 4
02:19:16 and then Gun Buster and then
02:19:18 otaku no video
02:19:20 well it's still a beautiful animation
02:19:22 regardless yes it's very cool
02:19:24 it's in like right in the middle of daikon 4
02:19:26 you should watch it it's only 4 minutes long and it's the best anime ever
02:19:28 I have seen daikon 4
02:19:30 I can't get into
02:19:32 Steven Seagal I hate him he's a fat
02:19:34 shit old movie
02:19:36 executive action is the greatest
02:19:38 movie of our generation
02:19:40 fucking you know what I love
02:19:42 that's right because I was all the wrong
02:19:44 generation I identify as an 80s kid
02:19:46 you know I love action movies
02:19:48 the cornier the better
02:19:50 you know I love
02:19:52 everything by Stallone and Schwarzenegger
02:19:54 I love Jean Claude Van Damme
02:19:56 but something about Steven Seagal
02:19:58 I just look at him and I want to puke
02:20:00 he doesn't look like he can do any of the things he's doing in his movies
02:20:02 he doesn't look like he can beat anyone up
02:20:04 he looks like just a fat dad
02:20:06 he's got some major dad bond going on
02:20:08 he's the worst action star in the history of action cinema
02:20:10 he belongs in
02:20:12 he belongs in like Uncle Buck
02:20:14 he's like a John Candy actor who was
02:20:16 cast into an action hero
02:20:18 I've seen like
02:20:20 a compilation of like oh really cheesy
02:20:22 hilarious Steven Seagal moments and I'm like
02:20:24 this would be funnier if anyone other than
02:20:26 Steven Seagal would make money in this scene
02:20:28 some executives were like
02:20:30 this is Steven Seagal we made him
02:20:32 a bad action hero as a joke
02:20:34 and that's just his whole career is just based on that
02:20:36 but then they forgot it
02:20:38 how do you feel about like Charles Bronson
02:20:40 he's the greatest actor of all time
02:20:42 yeah he's great Charles Bronson is great
02:20:44 he's good of course he's the fucking man
02:20:46 I love all of them they're all great except
02:20:48 he's the only one Steven Seagal is the only guy I hate
02:20:50 he sucks
02:20:52 you said Charles Bronson but I thought of
02:20:54 Charles Barclay, Bronson, Marle
02:20:56 Marle and Brandon
02:20:58 Jesse you made me think of one thing
02:21:00 that I pretty much can never get into
02:21:02 is the so bad it's good principle
02:21:04 because most things that are so bad
02:21:06 they're good are like
02:21:08 really sparse with things that are so bad it's good
02:21:10 which is why like Garzy's doing
02:21:12 the Digi introduced me to and that one's really great
02:21:14 at least the first episode because that one is
02:21:16 so dense with interestingly hilarious
02:21:18 bad stuff but most
02:21:20 so bad it's good things
02:21:22 same as I feel about like the guilty pleasure label
02:21:24 like if it's so bad it's good then it's just good
02:21:26 yeah
02:21:28 it depends on how you're looking at it
02:21:30 but Davoo you really should watch the room
02:21:32 because the room has gone so far
02:21:34 beyond ironic enjoyment for me
02:21:36 that I just love every single bit of it
02:21:38 yeah Nate I did watch the room
02:21:40 I didn't get a whole lot more out of it than just
02:21:42 like to be honest when I watched the nostalgic critics review
02:21:44 because he just showed all the funny parts
02:21:46 give it another try
02:21:48 hold on I already
02:21:50 watched the room and it wasn't like that
02:21:52 good like because you know whenever you watch
02:21:54 a review even if it's one of those really
02:21:56 long that guy with the glasses style ones
02:21:58 which basically just shows the movie
02:22:00 it doesn't quite capture
02:22:02 what the actual experience of the movie is
02:22:04 so it's not quite spoiling
02:22:06 the room has all these
02:22:08 really long scenes that aren't
02:22:10 that full of like really funny stuff
02:22:12 what are you talking about man
02:22:14 every second of that movie is funny
02:22:16 it's true it's all like every line
02:22:18 Tommy says is instant gold
02:22:20 it's fucking amazing
02:22:22 but I just want to say that I too
02:22:24 got into it via the nostalgic critic review
02:22:26 and I watched that video like a bunch of times
02:22:28 then I got into the movie so I'm just saying
02:22:30 Davoo I don't know
02:22:32 how many times you've seen it
02:22:34 something about the room is that I can see how you
02:22:36 would think that on like a first viewing
02:22:38 okay I know you said you saw
02:22:40 the nostalgic critic review so maybe this is
02:22:42 not you maybe you're not a naive viewer
02:22:44 like I'm gonna describe but someone who
02:22:46 watched the room one time probably
02:22:48 wouldn't he would there would be some funny bits
02:22:50 they laughed at but I think it
02:22:52 takes like several watches and like I
02:22:54 think you kind of have to discuss it and like digest it
02:22:56 to really understand the depth and the
02:22:58 density and complexity
02:23:00 it's such a social movie
02:23:02 you kind of slightly different
02:23:04 I want to change my terms
02:23:06 I'm never going to be able to appreciate
02:23:08 movies the way that James
02:23:10 Rolfe does even remotely
02:23:12 and the way that he can appreciate movies
02:23:14 like horror movies
02:23:16 and they're like really terrible and
02:23:18 like I don't know what he gets out of it
02:23:20 and that's definitely something I can't get into before
02:23:22 and cheesy and a cheesy horror
02:23:24 it's just like
02:23:26 I just feel like people can really get into
02:23:28 movies because they're movies
02:23:30 and the craft of
02:23:32 film itself is
02:23:34 captivating to them but see that's exactly what
02:23:36 makes the room cool because the deviations
02:23:38 from what you'd expect a good movie to be
02:23:40 are done so hilariously
02:23:42 in that movie that is
02:23:44 I can't look at the room
02:23:46 even as a bad movie
02:23:48 like to me it has a place
02:23:50 that no other film in history has
02:23:52 and it fits exactly for the room
02:23:54 I didn't know you were such a fan
02:23:56 you're a kinder experience
02:23:58 I've been down to clown with the room
02:24:00 since time immemorial
02:24:02 have you been to the live shows
02:24:04 where they play in theaters and throw the spoons
02:24:06 and shit? I've seen it
02:24:08 in theaters and stuff
02:24:10 that's what I was saying
02:24:12 so much has been what makes the room
02:24:14 enjoyable
02:24:16 and it was like the best thing I've ever been to
02:24:18 it was so much fun
02:24:20 so much of what makes it enjoyable
02:24:22 is the social aspect of it
02:24:24 is having a bunch of guys in a room
02:24:26 and everyone knows the lines
02:24:28 and moves in their minds and everything
02:24:30 that did make it better but I just want to clarify
02:24:32 I've already loved it intensely before going to that
02:24:34 I know Jesse was also a big Rocky Horror fan
02:24:36 so it's kind of the same
02:24:38 same thing
02:24:40 I'm with DeVoo
02:24:42 because I don't get like
02:24:44 because I don't think that's quite what we're describing
02:24:46 the room is more
02:24:48 I think of the room as being just like Garzi's wing
02:24:50 where it's so
02:24:52 there's so much to appreciate
02:24:54 and so much of it's outright memes
02:24:56 and with the room there's stuff that you can quote
02:24:58 every day of your life
02:25:00 I think DeVoo is talking more like just like
02:25:02 old timey effects and corny dialogue
02:25:04 there's a lot of those
02:25:06 kind of more like the cinemasticist
02:25:08 how he can get so into some of those old
02:25:10 schlock movies
02:25:12 and it's not a cultural thing
02:25:14 it's not him joking with his friends
02:25:16 it's just him watching these movies
02:25:18 and enjoying them by himself
02:25:20 are you familiar with this one James Rawl video
02:25:22 the top 40
02:25:24 shitty shark movies
02:25:26 he and his wife watch them more
02:25:28 than 40 shark movies
02:25:30 and like Sharknada was coming out
02:25:32 as he was making the list so we put it at number 5
02:25:34 at the last second
02:25:36 he had the mental ability
02:25:38 to watch all of those
02:25:40 I'm with you dude
02:25:42 I can only barely stand to watch one good video
02:25:44 I could
02:25:46 see the thing is that like what you were saying
02:25:48 about like being so enamored with the
02:25:50 craft of film I could definitely
02:25:52 do that with anime
02:25:54 I don't think I would enjoy all those shitty anime
02:25:56 necessarily
02:25:58 but I could easily watch any
02:26:00 shit anime just because it's anime
02:26:02 because I'm so enamored with knowing
02:26:04 everything about it and knowing every single
02:26:06 possible thing
02:26:08 I think it really is more than just appreciating
02:26:10 to appreciate something like these
02:26:12 it's not about really judging it by itself
02:26:14 it's about having a larger context
02:26:16 of what the work is
02:26:18 and how it deviates from that and why that's
02:26:20 so cool but I do think that like
02:26:22 with stuff like the room in Garzi's wing
02:26:24 that's like a different story
02:26:26 because it's not just that it's so bad it's good
02:26:28 it's so bad it's like amazing
02:26:30 like legitimately the funniest
02:26:32 movie ever
02:26:34 it's got green light with these things
02:26:36 it's like the fact that people like check the box
02:26:38 like okay ship this is just like
02:26:40 holy shit it's amazing
02:26:42 I mean a lot of what
02:26:44 makes bad things
02:26:46 really bad things good and interesting
02:26:48 is the way that it sort of
02:26:50 forms a narrative about the person
02:26:52 exactly the things you learn about Tommy
02:26:54 by watching that movie are
02:26:56 yeah you learn about Tommy when you watch
02:26:58 the room you learn about what's his name
02:27:00 I just want to bring this up briefly
02:27:02 that I've recently become fascinated as of
02:27:04 the latest YMS video where he talked about
02:27:06 the three movies by that one fucking weird guy
02:27:08 those look so good
02:27:10 they look pretty fucking hilarious
02:27:12 and it suddenly dawned on me
02:27:14 that like all these guys
02:27:16 obviously these directors are fucking weird
02:27:18 right they're definitely weird people
02:27:20 and like their movies always have like
02:27:22 suicide like strong themes
02:27:24 of suicide and depression and death
02:27:26 and it's like these are like
02:27:28 tormented people
02:27:30 like these are obviously people who
02:27:32 are trying to express themselves because
02:27:34 they've probably lived a whole
02:27:36 life of being fucking weird and nobody gets them
02:27:38 and so they try to make a movie so people
02:27:40 can get them and people get them even less
02:27:42 and they get it all wrong and that's why they want
02:27:44 to fucking kill themselves
02:27:46 there's no way to win
02:27:48 I bet the guy from that new YMS review
02:27:50 he had like a laptop back in the 90s
02:27:52 when he was nerdy and kids made fun of him
02:27:54 and broke his laptops and now all he can do
02:27:56 in his movies is break more laptops
02:27:58 and all of his movies to vent his frustration
02:28:00 about laptops
02:28:02 and yeah so like did you I totally
02:28:04 I'm like that with video games
02:28:06 like right now I'm on Moby games
02:28:08 I click random game and without exception
02:28:10 I'm at least a little bit interested
02:28:12 because the fact
02:28:14 that video games exist
02:28:16 is always the most mind blowing
02:28:18 incredible fact that I can
02:28:20 ever think no matter how many times I do it
02:28:22 that's how I feel about anime
02:28:24 and yeah and a lot of people seem
02:28:26 to be that way with film like they just
02:28:28 can't believe that this film is
02:28:30 happening and it never gets old to them
02:28:32 dude you have no idea how many times
02:28:34 I like I sit back on my bed
02:28:36 and I'm like because I know enough about
02:28:38 anime to know that this is like
02:28:40 like I always think
02:28:42 of it as like 40 people making all
02:28:44 anime right like that's a gross
02:28:46 exaggeration but anime is so incestuous
02:28:48 that it's like
02:28:50 it really is compared to anything like
02:28:52 compared to the world at large
02:28:54 tiny handful of people
02:28:56 on this far away archipelago
02:28:58 in the middle of fucking nowhere
02:29:00 in the middle of the Pacific Ocean
02:29:02 who are sitting there like
02:29:04 creating this it is
02:29:06 an archipelago it's a bunch of islands
02:29:08 totally an archipelago
02:29:10 you know
02:29:12 it's just
02:29:14 a bunch of
02:29:16 this handful of people on this island
02:29:18 somewhere far away who have been doing
02:29:20 this thing for so long
02:29:22 that there's this whole culture around it
02:29:24 this whole like
02:29:26 it's own trajectory of development all these
02:29:28 things and like 45 shows coming out
02:29:30 of season and yet
02:29:32 it's so insular
02:29:34 that it doesn't make sense to anyone else
02:29:36 like how the fuck does anime exist
02:29:38 how are they still making it
02:29:40 how is that fuck how is it not died
02:29:42 like it it just keeps getting
02:29:44 more insular it never gets
02:29:46 bigger and broader and more appealing to the rest
02:29:48 of the world like every once in a while it does
02:29:50 at least netflix is helping
02:29:52 and attack on titan people watch
02:29:54 that shit but then a show will come out
02:29:56 that like I feel like 12 people
02:29:58 can possibly appreciate it
02:30:00 and I'm like how are these 12 people
02:30:02 gonna fund this show that only 12 people
02:30:04 made
02:30:06 each one of them buys 12
02:30:08 even in the age of light novels did you
02:30:10 do you still feel that way or do you just feel
02:30:12 that way about some shows light novels are the most
02:30:14 insular those are the ones that are like
02:30:16 yeah but they haven't established audience already
02:30:18 right but that's the thing
02:30:20 there it is
02:30:22 for the most part in japanese anime
02:30:24 it's just
02:30:26 it's crazy that
02:30:28 there's a whole market
02:30:30 that is so small
02:30:32 and so like plays to itself
02:30:34 and has
02:30:36 it doesn't seem to be trying to get any
02:30:38 bigger for the most part
02:30:40 and yet it somehow
02:30:42 can generate more content
02:30:44 than like any other medium
02:30:46 like what other medium has 45
02:30:48 news things coming out every
02:30:50 fucking three months that is
02:30:52 an insane amount of content
02:30:54 video games but I guess there's way less people
02:30:56 45 video games
02:30:58 going steam probably
02:31:00 I mean in indie games
02:31:02 I guess so but in indie games also like
02:31:04 one guy making it where an anime is like
02:31:06 a team of 100 people
02:31:08 that's fair that's fair
02:31:10 you don't know just how many games
02:31:12 there are on steam I remember on a digi bros
02:31:14 you were saying eventually you've seen
02:31:16 all the steam games no eventually
02:31:18 you've seen all the steam games that are linked
02:31:20 to by other steam games and recommended
02:31:22 pages if you go to
02:31:24 like list all games by most
02:31:26 recent multiple games come out every
02:31:28 day yeah yeah
02:31:30 well whatever that's cool all right we get
02:31:32 the point it is sweet it is sweet
02:31:34 let's do another one
02:31:36 hold on I want to figure out how to do that
02:31:38 before we move on
02:31:40 from the subject I know that the subject
02:31:42 evolved a little bit but it was originally
02:31:44 things that are so bad it's good and before
02:31:46 we move on I can't help but mention
02:31:48 Christian Weston Changlin
02:31:50 the electric hedgehog pokemon
02:31:52 which um wait
02:31:54 have you hippos read it
02:31:56 Nate has read it
02:31:58 digi de vu jesse have you guys read
02:32:00 I have not oh man
02:32:02 you guys should do it
02:32:04 okay I have read the entire
02:32:06 thing multiple times
02:32:08 I was way into the whole
02:32:10 thing in like college and a little
02:32:12 after and um
02:32:14 the thing about sonichu is
02:32:16 the the comic itself
02:32:18 I mean it looks terrible obviously you can tell
02:32:20 just by looking at it that the art is bad
02:32:22 the story is
02:32:24 very often extremely boring
02:32:26 and usually completely
02:32:28 incomprehensible
02:32:30 but the challenge and the
02:32:32 satisfaction of reading sonichu
02:32:34 comes from understanding
02:32:36 Christian Weston Changlin himself
02:32:38 understanding his mindset
02:32:40 and understanding what was happening in his life
02:32:42 when he was drawing these things
02:32:44 and fucking figuring out
02:32:46 how to parse what it is he's trying to say
02:32:48 and often it is extremely obvious what's going on
02:32:50 but sometimes it's brutally difficult
02:32:52 like
02:32:54 like there's a scene
02:32:56 there's a scene where
02:32:58 uh like
02:33:00 he beats up a bunch of cops
02:33:02 at a bowling alley
02:33:04 in the comic yeah jerk cops
02:33:06 and he says like they I'm not the
02:33:08 weak person I was I'm much saltier now
02:33:10 and like
02:33:12 what does that mean right
02:33:14 well if you dig enough
02:33:16 you find out that um
02:33:18 Christian Weston Chandler went to like some
02:33:20 bacon in like 2005
02:33:22 at which he met the voice actors
02:33:24 that played Hayat in excel saga
02:33:26 and excel saga contains
02:33:28 a joke where in excel
02:33:30 says ah I'm not the sweet
02:33:32 person she thinks I am I'm much saltier
02:33:34 wait did Christian start
02:33:36 the salt thing like
02:33:38 is that how salt became a thing that people
02:33:40 know okay no no
02:33:42 he means he means that he's tough
02:33:44 um yeah so he it was it's
02:33:46 actually a stolen joke
02:33:48 from excel saga with its
02:33:50 context removed and butchered to the point
02:33:52 which he stole a lot from including his own
02:33:54 inclusion in the story as a character
02:33:56 there's dozens
02:33:58 and dozens yeah excel saga
02:34:00 is like an unsung an unsung
02:34:02 hero of like not know that
02:34:04 at all yeah it's big it's big
02:34:06 it's yeah it's even the reason I haven't read
02:34:08 sonnet you like all of his plagiarized
02:34:10 the reason I haven't read sonnet you is
02:34:12 I've always been under the impression that one
02:34:14 day you were going to just tell me the
02:34:16 entire CW
02:34:18 story that's what he did with me that's what he did with me back
02:34:20 years ago I've been I've been waiting for the day
02:34:22 that we can sit down and you can just describe
02:34:24 the whole I just like to propose
02:34:26 for radcon let's just have the sonnet you
02:34:28 sit down
02:34:30 appreciate the whole day yeah
02:34:32 but sit down by the fire and then
02:34:34 pulls out the tome it's dusty
02:34:36 he blows the pages all the dust comes
02:34:38 off the tome by the way
02:34:40 is uh is
02:34:42 oolulila's book yeah you should bring
02:34:44 that too
02:34:46 legend of the legend of the ten
02:34:48 elemental masters which I also own
02:34:50 oh but yeah I don't think I've ever
02:34:52 mentioned this on the show but I have a piece of
02:34:54 original Christian art I have a comic
02:34:56 page that I commissioned from him
02:34:58 that shows the secret fate of the
02:35:00 brown-shirted imposter that was never shown
02:35:02 in the comic I was like please liquid
02:35:04 Chris $50 you know draw draw me
02:35:06 yeah liquid Chris draw me
02:35:08 what happened to liquid Chris and I
02:35:10 have it on my wall and I will show it
02:35:12 to him probably on my twitter put that up
02:35:14 and I want to see it yeah
02:35:16 again um
02:35:18 I was gonna say something
02:35:20 about um
02:35:22 yeah it's like it's the whole
02:35:24 sonnet you saga is like this weird puzzle
02:35:26 that you gotta unpack but once you do
02:35:28 it's like it's it's dense
02:35:30 with meaning in the in the same kind of way
02:35:32 the room is by the way there's
02:35:34 I did I did link you to the way to
02:35:36 list all new games on steam
02:35:38 well you actually comes out every day this
02:35:40 week your your uh your
02:35:42 list doesn't have as many listed as the
02:35:44 one I had already found but I'm seeing
02:35:46 9351
02:35:48 not that many games well yeah I narrowed
02:35:50 it I narrowed out uh I narrowed out
02:35:52 software and downloadable content and that stuff
02:35:54 okay well just full games who
02:35:56 gives a shit let's move on
02:35:58 I have another one
02:36:00 thing I can't get into and I need to
02:36:02 you know preclude I need to
02:36:04 disclaim this you know I'm gonna sound
02:36:06 like a nerd he's gonna talk about economics
02:36:08 here it comes
02:36:10 something I can't get into
02:36:12 I'm gonna sound like a jerk
02:36:14 so I want to so as soon as I say this
02:36:16 I'm gonna have to clarify why immediately
02:36:18 mm-hmm I can't I was
02:36:20 the same with the gender binary I can't
02:36:22 get into sports
02:36:24 because not because of like athleticism
02:36:26 fine with that you expect to be argued with
02:36:28 by anyone in this call like none of us
02:36:30 fucking yeah I think our audience is gonna
02:36:32 be mostly who the hell was gonna make you sound
02:36:34 like even though I know I do like
02:36:36 football and I watch football occasionally but
02:36:38 even though I know most people will agree with me I just
02:36:40 know there's some subconscious judgment of
02:36:42 like because you know you don't have
02:36:44 any athletic ability that's why right
02:36:46 well you know that might be part of it
02:36:48 but the real reason is
02:36:50 is that there's no level
02:36:52 design I you know
02:36:54 exactly
02:36:56 one level design there is exactly
02:36:58 that's not because I think about this
02:37:00 Final Fantasy 13 is the worst
02:37:02 game ever but because for one simple
02:37:04 reason it's all a hallway right okay but
02:37:06 imagine this what about a Final Fantasy 7
02:37:08 you can change your character I'm at 13
02:37:10 I'm at Final Fantasy 13 okay
02:37:12 yeah I actually
02:37:14 I didn't even hear you say so
02:37:16 okay I'm sorry but
02:37:18 but here's the difference is that
02:37:20 every time you play Final Fantasy 13 in this
02:37:22 example your characters are all different
02:37:24 and it's a different team comp and you get to
02:37:26 have a different team that you're fighting
02:37:28 you know what's funny to me about this
02:37:30 argument is that one of
02:37:32 my favorite video games
02:37:34 of all time is Mario
02:37:36 Power Tennis which has no
02:37:38 level design and it's one of the best
02:37:40 games ever and
02:37:42 I also like watching Tennis on TV
02:37:44 so I don't like watching Tennis at all
02:37:46 boring why don't you fucking
02:37:48 why don't you fucking get some
02:37:50 DFW David Foster Wall
02:37:52 essays and go read Infinite Jest you fucking
02:37:54 you fucking
02:37:56 by the way David David
02:37:58 Foster Wall yeah it is about tennis
02:38:00 oh god nobody knew that
02:38:04 I've got the audio book I can
02:38:06 listen to it and watch tennis
02:38:08 at the same time you know what I totally
02:38:10 I totally don't agree oh my god
02:38:12 I can play Mario Power Tennis and listen to Infinite Jest
02:38:14 oh my god
02:38:16 I have to buy the new Mario Tennis game
02:38:18 for the Wii U this is the
02:38:20 greatest realization of my life
02:38:22 I might be drunk now by the way
02:38:24 I actually don't agree with what I said
02:38:26 before about the you can't get into it
02:38:28 I think actually the definition is
02:38:30 can you really get into it
02:38:32 and become a fan of it not just have
02:38:34 isolated moments of enjoyment
02:38:36 let me tell you it's like I turn on
02:38:38 no shut up I turn on tennis
02:38:40 and I'm like hmm that's kind of cool
02:38:42 that's kind of and then I'm done I'm done
02:38:44 I'm bored I'm that's it that's it
02:38:46 I'm not like into tennis
02:38:48 because there's because it's the same
02:38:50 thing every time and I know it's all about
02:38:52 the staff and people but that's not enough for me
02:38:54 the reason people enjoy it is because
02:38:56 all the players they know the ins and the outs
02:38:58 they know the staff they have expectations for what's going to happen
02:39:00 the majority of the appeal of sports
02:39:02 to sports fans is the narrative
02:39:04 it's all about
02:39:06 but there's just not a narrative
02:39:08 there's not like a world that they're inhabiting
02:39:10 it's the same location every time
02:39:12 and I you know I would
02:39:14 dislike the world they're inhabiting is our world
02:39:16 the location is
02:39:18 no they're not
02:39:20 it's the same court every time
02:39:22 it's not there's four different types of courts
02:39:24 you've got the clay court the grass court
02:39:26 the fucking the super bouncy one
02:39:28 that's not enough
02:39:30 the players as characters exist
02:39:32 in the real world that's where the stakes are
02:39:34 you've got that world
02:39:36 you've got that one court where the
02:39:38 physical tangible way
02:39:40 you've got the one court where sometimes the tiles
02:39:42 there's like water underneath
02:39:44 and you fall into piranha plants and stuff
02:39:46 what about snakes and ladders
02:39:48 shoots and ladders god damn it
02:39:50 but Davoo more than
02:39:52 just the game is relevant to the game
02:39:54 with a ladder
02:39:56 we at hippo were both trying to make a reverent jokes
02:39:58 while you guys were talking
02:40:00 if it were the other way around
02:40:02 let's say like football
02:40:04 just think about how much cooler football would be
02:40:06 if it took place on a mountain
02:40:08 yeah it wouldn't be even anymore
02:40:10 but it would be the coolest thing
02:40:12 wasn't that what homestuck art was about
02:40:14 the one that hussy
02:40:16 went through so much effort to get
02:40:18 it's not homestuck
02:40:20 the football player on the mountain
02:40:22 fighting like a dragon
02:40:24 that football player fighting against
02:40:26 an evil unicorn with an
02:40:28 erupting mountain
02:40:30 imagine if soccer
02:40:32 took place in a marsh
02:40:34 and they had to get around
02:40:36 there's an interesting thing
02:40:38 back when
02:40:40 in England football
02:40:42 used to be played
02:40:44 between towns
02:40:46 and they would kick the ball from one town to the other
02:40:48 through forests and over rivers
02:40:50 that's so cool
02:40:52 that would be what you would want to see
02:40:54 this is exactly
02:40:56 what hippo wants all football to look like
02:41:02 that's pretty great
02:41:08 I'll link that in the description
02:41:10 I'm the one editing this
02:41:12 two of you have said you were going to link something in the description
02:41:14 forgetting that I added
02:41:16 interview digi you said you were going to link that fan art
02:41:18 that I made and you didn't link it
02:41:20 I had to wait for a commenter to point it out
02:41:22 and I had to go in and put it in
02:41:24 okay let's
02:41:26 Jesse do you have another thing you can't get into
02:41:28 oh yeah
02:41:30 okay new fighting games
02:41:32 can't do it
02:41:34 okay
02:41:36 so I can't get into fighting games in general
02:41:38 I used to
02:41:40 really like street fighter
02:41:42 but that was when I was young and naive
02:41:44 I used to play street fighter 2 on our SNES
02:41:46 yeah when we had the Super Nintendo
02:41:48 and it was just casually
02:41:50 it was great
02:41:52 any fighting game
02:41:54 that I grew up with
02:41:56 and have a fondness for
02:41:58 is street fighter, Mortal Kombat
02:42:00 Smash Brothers, whatever
02:42:02 I have my character
02:42:04 I have my guy
02:42:06 I know all the moves, I know how to play it
02:42:08 I can be reasonably competent at it for the rest of my life
02:42:10 but any
02:42:12 game that's just coming out
02:42:14 I don't have anybody around to play with
02:42:16 so I don't have a fucking
02:42:18 there's no social aspect to it
02:42:20 I don't have the ability
02:42:22 I don't have the ability
02:42:24 I don't like you getting everybody's names confused
02:42:26 I fucking shwasted making it as ass to yourself
02:42:28 on the internet
02:42:30 everybody shut the fuck up for a second
02:42:32 god damn it let Jesse continue
02:42:34 I don't have the ability to like
02:42:36 learn a new character
02:42:38 shut the fuck up
02:42:40 shit
02:42:42 oh christ
02:42:44 you got me to that point
02:42:46 it took you two and a half hours but you did it
02:42:50 Davoo kicked me out of the podcast
02:42:52 that didn't do it, you started yelling at me about yell
02:42:54 that didn't do it
02:42:56 but you finally pushed me
02:42:58 right over the edge
02:43:00 I'm sorry
02:43:04 okay go on
02:43:06 I'm listening
02:43:08 I don't know
02:43:10 that's fucking it
02:43:12 I fucking would have had more if you'd let me talk the first time
02:43:14 alright
02:43:16 I have a really easy time
02:43:18 getting into new fighting games
02:43:20 cause all my friends are fighting game addicts
02:43:22 all they do is talk about fighting games
02:43:24 play fighting games
02:43:26 I don't have the time nor the patience
02:43:28 nor the ability nor the incentive
02:43:30 to learn a new character in a new game
02:43:32 that's my whole point that's all I wanted to say
02:43:34 move on to the next one
02:43:36 the last fighting game
02:43:38 I was able to get into
02:43:40 I guess I kinda got into smash at some point
02:43:42 but I got into
02:43:44 I just like the aesthetic of guilty gear so much
02:43:46 and I thought that Kai looked so cool
02:43:48 I thought he was such a cool looking dude
02:43:50 that I managed to sit down
02:43:52 for long enough to learn how to sort of play
02:43:54 Kai in guilty gear
02:43:56 I have this real burning desire
02:43:58 I have a lot of weird plans for when
02:44:00 we all eventually live near each other
02:44:02 and one of them is that
02:44:04 Jesse is always describing
02:44:06 guilty gear as like the coolest game
02:44:08 that he's never gotten into or never played
02:44:10 and like I have this
02:44:12 dream of having Jesse around
02:44:14 and I can be like Jesse
02:44:16 let's play guilty gear and I can
02:44:18 I can be the one who finally gets
02:44:20 Jesse into guilty gear
02:44:22 cause I fucking love guilty gear
02:44:24 How do you feel about that Jesse? Are you into that?
02:44:26 I'm all into that
02:44:28 Oh so you are open to it
02:44:30 I thought that you weren't interested in new games
02:44:32 Well if you had been listening Nate you would have heard
02:44:34 I'm sorry
02:44:36 Wow Nate I'm actually shocked
02:44:38 that you actually didn't get his point
02:44:40 Oh right cause there's no one to play with
02:44:42 Okay right I'm with you
02:44:44 I'll play
02:44:46 guilty gear with you fucks
02:44:48 Yeah it's a fun game, we used to play with you
02:44:50 Playing video games online is miserable and shit
02:44:52 even when it's with people you know
02:44:54 I have no interest in playing games online
02:44:56 Oh man that's funny cause like
02:44:58 I can't definitely cannot get into
02:45:00 playing online games randomly
02:45:02 It's not an appealing idea
02:45:04 This is relevant I gotta tell you
02:45:06 Hey Tom be back
02:45:08 Tom you love guilty gear, how do you feel about playing it
02:45:10 online?
02:45:12 I don't play guilty gear online
02:45:14 Interesting
02:45:16 Well let me tell you guys cause playing online sucks
02:45:18 I played League of Legends for years online
02:45:20 and it was only so that I would have
02:45:22 an excuse to hang out with my friends
02:45:24 because they live far away in other states
02:45:26 I agree
02:45:28 Overwatch now and shit
02:45:30 I played Halo 2 back in the day all the time
02:45:32 but I've never played it online
02:45:34 with my friends
02:45:36 We all like, you know, schedule it together
02:45:38 we'd all play, I've never played solo by myself
02:45:40 Same thing after college when I played Black Ops
02:45:42 when I played with some of my friends
02:45:44 but I hate playing online by myself
02:45:46 Me too
02:45:48 because I'm being social in general
02:45:50 so just a bunch of people yelling fag in my ear
02:45:52 playing a game that's really boring
02:45:54 so I hate that
02:45:56 I used to play a single player game that's constructed around
02:45:58 having experience
02:46:00 If only they made a single player game
02:46:02 about guys yelling fag in your ear
02:46:04 I'm into that
02:46:06 I used to play Halo and Gears of War online
02:46:08 but that was because you could have
02:46:10 a split screen with you and your friend
02:46:12 but you were in the same match together
02:46:14 online so that was always fucking cool
02:46:16 I did that with Halo 2 a lot too
02:46:18 I'd go to my friend Mike's house and we'd just fucking
02:46:20 get the Xbox going
02:46:22 When you have a friend next to you
02:46:24 they're all yelling at you like
02:46:26 what the fuck man
02:46:28 don't use the fucking sniper that you and your friend
02:46:30 can just be like listen to this fucking idiot
02:46:32 When it's just you hearing that voice
02:46:34 it wears on your soul after a while
02:46:36 You're like does this guy really
02:46:38 feel this strongly about this video game
02:46:40 I'm sorry I used the sniper rifle
02:46:42 please
02:46:44 please forgive me
02:46:46 I get it
02:46:48 you seem to care a lot more than I do
02:46:50 so I'll just back out of this match
02:46:52 and go back to other things
02:46:54 I immediately muted the chat
02:46:56 and overwatch once I got there
02:46:58 There's only
02:47:00 three multiplayer online games
02:47:02 that I can stand
02:47:04 it's Hearthstone, World of Warcraft
02:47:06 and Team Fortress 2
02:47:08 Hearthstone and Team Fortress 2
02:47:10 is okay because when I lose
02:47:12 it doesn't feel so bad and in World of Warcraft
02:47:14 I can just beat by myself
02:47:16 but in every other game
02:47:18 I've ever played online
02:47:20 including Mario Kart Wii
02:47:22 and fucking
02:47:24 anything
02:47:26 it makes me so infuriated that I
02:47:28 break things and I hate everyone
02:47:30 It's the worst
02:47:32 There's one game that I did play online
02:47:34 by myself and I didn't have a ton of fun
02:47:36 with it but it was
02:47:38 the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
02:47:40 I had to do it because you had to
02:47:42 for the story you had to get your
02:47:44 readiness up by playing
02:47:46 which is a crock of shit
02:47:48 it was like horde mode
02:47:50 so that was a bit more
02:47:52 because it wasn't like people screaming at you
02:47:54 that you're a fag
02:47:56 people working together or trying to
02:47:58 or at least doing their own thing
02:48:00 it was more palatable
02:48:02 Relevant to that
02:48:04 most people
02:48:06 when they characterize online gaming
02:48:08 it's people yelling at you
02:48:10 but those times when you get someone
02:48:12 who compliments you and stuff
02:48:14 I always feel like that's the most heartwarming
02:48:16 in the world to realize that some random
02:48:18 stranger is a halfway decent person
02:48:20 is always really nice
02:48:22 I think the idea of online gaming would be
02:48:24 fucking great if people didn't suck so much ball
02:48:26 I will say
02:48:28 that I am a big fan of
02:48:30 MMORPGs like Terra
02:48:32 and Black Desert but I play them totally
02:48:34 solo and talk to nobody
02:48:36 so I just play them because I like the mechanics
02:48:38 World of Warcraft is my favorite
02:48:40 single player
02:48:42 I'm surprised
02:48:44 actually that is a great transition
02:48:46 because I was going to bring this up
02:48:48 as one of the things I can't get into
02:48:50 which is like
02:48:52 playing
02:48:54 online games in particular
02:48:56 and just generally any game that's
02:48:58 not about beating it in like
02:49:00 a sitting
02:49:02 I love single player games
02:49:04 where I can sit down for 2 or 3 days
02:49:06 and beat the whole game
02:49:08 and be done with it for as long as I want
02:49:10 Dark Souls 3
02:49:12 beat it in 18 hours
02:49:14 played a little bit more
02:49:16 just because I like the game so much
02:49:18 and then fucking forgot about Doom
02:49:20 beat the main campaign, went back a little bit
02:49:22 alright I'm fucking tired of Doom let's move on with my life
02:49:24 any game that's like
02:49:26 you play it regularly or you come back to it
02:49:28 or there's not an easy out
02:49:30 for me what's always made me paranoid
02:49:32 about playing online games
02:49:34 is the idea that if I leave
02:49:36 I fuck somebody over
02:49:38 oh yeah that's a trap right there
02:49:40 they're setting for you
02:49:42 yeah in a lot of those games and I could not even imagine
02:49:44 like one like League of Legends
02:49:46 where the matches are like 45 minutes long
02:49:48 it's a nightmare dude
02:49:50 you know first person shooter games is not too bad
02:49:52 it's like somewhat because
02:49:54 I like to be able to just get up at any time
02:49:56 when I'm playing a game I like to just go like
02:49:58 I literally in Dark Souls sometimes
02:50:00 I smack an enemy and he's dead
02:50:02 and then I realize I'm hungry and I put the controller down
02:50:04 and I go eat or you know
02:50:06 someone calls me to go do something
02:50:08 like I really value that
02:50:10 and when I can't do that
02:50:12 when it's like oh shit I have to finish this match
02:50:14 before I can go eat dinner
02:50:16 you know that it's like
02:50:18 unbelievable stress for me
02:50:20 and I cannot handle it
02:50:22 not to co-op the point
02:50:24 but yeah lol and mobas
02:50:26 are something that I cannot get into
02:50:28 and that I honestly fucking hate
02:50:30 I can't get into any point and click games
02:50:32 I cannot stand point and click
02:50:34 controls in video games
02:50:36 no no
02:50:38 some friends of mine tried to get
02:50:40 I played League of Legends for a while with some friends
02:50:42 and they tried to ease me
02:50:44 into it but they could not
02:50:46 help themselves but to get mad at me
02:50:48 it's because you depend on everyone to carry
02:50:50 the weight of a team it's brutal you know
02:50:52 yeah I know right like they were counting
02:50:54 on me but like I'm a noob I couldn't
02:50:56 you can't play with friends like that
02:50:58 and it fucking sucked and I played
02:51:00 enough I had a couple of good
02:51:02 kills I had some fun occasionally
02:51:04 it wasn't just like D&D it wasn't
02:51:06 all bad there were good there were highlight moments
02:51:08 but then I sort of got
02:51:10 okay with warwick like I sort of
02:51:12 figured out how to play warwick decently
02:51:14 and I was like oh cool now I'm starting to
02:51:16 have a little bit of fun and they were like
02:51:18 okay now stop playing warwick
02:51:20 pick up a new character learn the first out of like
02:51:22 a hundred god damn champs you need to learn
02:51:24 and then repeat for every
02:51:26 and then repeat for every character
02:51:28 until you know them all because that's the
02:51:30 only way you can fucking be good at this game
02:51:32 I was like no I don't understand
02:51:34 how anyone I cannot
02:51:36 understand how anyone has any fun
02:51:38 with these fucking games unless they're at like
02:51:40 a super high competitive level
02:51:42 that takes thousands of hours to get to
02:51:44 and who the fuck would want to do
02:51:46 because the thing is I only did it because
02:51:48 my friends played you know I think the
02:51:50 people who I think the people who get really
02:51:52 into those kind of games are ones who like
02:51:54 don't really do anything else
02:51:56 Oh absolutely my brother
02:51:58 shade gets really into like
02:52:00 like right now he's really into overwatch
02:52:02 and it's like overwatch came out
02:52:04 and now that is what he does
02:52:06 that would be awesome
02:52:08 apparently all my friends are playing it now
02:52:10 but shade is definitely going to be the one
02:52:12 who's the highest skilled in playing the most
02:52:14 because he gets into a game and he'll just
02:52:16 like not stop for months
02:52:18 it's all he does
02:52:20 he's actually editing a
02:52:22 overwatch video just comparing
02:52:24 all the running speeds of all the characters
02:52:26 like proving which ones are the fastest
02:52:28 and slowest like just because he fucking
02:52:30 felt like it you know
02:52:32 well he's I don't know it's not like a
02:52:34 narrated video it's like just
02:52:36 footage and music it's just remember
02:52:38 when the fucking he said it to his own
02:52:40 music to which is cool remember when the
02:52:42 Game Grumps dude made that like clapping thing
02:52:44 of all the smash oh yeah that was great
02:52:46 just reminds me of that but before we
02:52:48 compare the running speeds first we
02:52:50 have to talk about we'll have to talk about
02:52:52 parallel universes
02:52:54 yeah oh if only the best
02:52:56 meme ever
02:52:58 all right uh Tom now that you're back
02:53:00 do you have another thing you can't get into
02:53:02 um let's see

02:53:28 hahahaha
02:53:30 hahahaha
02:53:32 all right Tom what's your
02:53:34 all right I don't think I can follow that up
02:53:36 no um one of the things I've written here
02:53:38 is sports slash reality tv
02:53:40 I think spucking retarded
02:53:42 we did cover sports but not reality
02:53:44 we did sports we did not do I want to talk
02:53:46 about reality well let Tom start
02:53:48 yeah yeah yeah I don't know I just
02:53:50 my mother is obsessed with reality tv
02:53:52 so I see it all the time
02:53:54 because all she does is watch tv when she's not
02:53:56 at work
02:53:58 and I've just seen like the depravity that
02:54:00 she's been watching it ever since like the first survivor
02:54:02 like so oh yeah
02:54:04 so I've just I've I've
02:54:06 watched it evolve
02:54:08 via proxy and it's just the most
02:54:10 disgusting vapid boring
02:54:12 shit ever and I don't yeah I mean
02:54:14 I can understand why people like it
02:54:16 but I just can't believe people are so stupid
02:54:18 that they like it there's one
02:54:20 reality tv show that I do like
02:54:22 is called I'm a celebrity get me out of here
02:54:24 I don't know whether you guys have I don't know
02:54:26 but it's um a bunch of celebrities
02:54:28 trapped in an Australian jungle
02:54:30 and they have to do challenges in order to get
02:54:32 food and you're just
02:54:34 you're just seeing them go insane over
02:54:36 like a course of a week or two
02:54:38 it's pretty good
02:54:40 all right I too I'm not really
02:54:42 into reality tv show hold on
02:54:44 wait before you start I want to ask Hippo
02:54:46 I want to
02:54:48 I want to say that if it's celebrities
02:54:50 I don't think it entirely counts
02:54:52 because at that point
02:54:54 it's basically like a panel show with a
02:54:56 broader concept right
02:54:58 like celebrities are famous for the
02:55:00 fact that they have a personality
02:55:02 and are interesting people
02:55:04 on some level as opposed to reality
02:55:06 shows like what makes it reality
02:55:08 is that it's just real people
02:55:10 supposedly well the thing about these celebrities
02:55:12 is that they're washed up and nobody know right
02:55:14 nobody actually know we have a few like
02:55:16 they've been in a tv show we have a bunch of shows
02:55:18 like that we had the the surreal
02:55:20 life which was like the like
02:55:22 basically a bunch of d-list celebrities
02:55:24 doing the like a regular
02:55:26 reality show but I don't know
02:55:28 I feel like there's something slightly different because to me the whole point
02:55:30 of it being reality is that it's
02:55:32 supposed to be just like well a window
02:55:34 into the life of some well you are seeing them
02:55:36 like literally stop and go in
02:55:38 it's hilarious there's a reality
02:55:40 there for sure okay that's why I
02:55:42 that's why I'm hesitant to get to see the reality show
02:55:44 because it sounds too good
02:55:46 all right anyway Ben was saying something
02:55:48 okay
02:55:50 yeah I don't really make a habit of watching
02:55:52 reality shows I haven't seen that many but there are
02:55:54 some that I have really really
02:55:56 enjoyed I want to tell you
02:55:58 the first one the first one was
02:56:00 penny arcade strip search
02:56:02 which was not on tv it was a web series
02:56:04 and I should preface this by saying that I
02:56:06 don't really like penny arcade the comic
02:56:08 or find it funny at all and yet
02:56:10 I fucking love everything that
02:56:12 Gabe and Tycho do I think
02:56:14 like every interview with them and every
02:56:16 like I listen to their podcast
02:56:18 and I think that as dudes
02:56:20 they're just fucking awesome I love the shit
02:56:22 out of them and they decided
02:56:24 that hey we've got this fucking comic empire
02:56:26 and all this money let's just do
02:56:28 something and they decided to have a
02:56:30 reality show where they invited
02:56:32 all of these cartoonists all these bait
02:56:34 you know more or less unknown cartoonists
02:56:36 into a house
02:56:38 and they had them do challenges
02:56:40 and and fucking compete
02:56:42 to win like a spot like
02:56:44 basically like working in the penny arcade
02:56:46 office and like being like an official
02:56:48 penny arcade partner and
02:56:50 the thing about this show was
02:56:52 that Gabe and Tycho set out to make it
02:56:54 as like as
02:56:56 bog standard a reality
02:56:58 show as possible they wanted to direct
02:57:00 everything so that the artist would hate
02:57:02 each other and want to kill each other
02:57:04 and foster bitter rivalry
02:57:06 and drama but
02:57:08 they couldn't because they're weak
02:57:10 because Gabe and Tycho are weak bitches
02:57:12 and they did not have the fucking
02:57:14 emotional stones to carry through
02:57:16 with this plan of theirs
02:57:18 so what ended up happening is they all became
02:57:20 best friends and they all like loved each
02:57:22 other and like they all cried when they
02:57:24 left because they loved each other so much
02:57:26 and they couldn't bear to leave one another behind
02:57:28 it was that sounds like
02:57:30 a deconstruction of the whole
02:57:32 concept of reality shows
02:57:34 yes it was an unintentional
02:57:36 deconstruction of the whole concept
02:57:38 and it was fucking awesome
02:57:40 some of the challenges are really stupid
02:57:42 and some episodes are better than others
02:57:44 but like some of the
02:57:46 people in there were really great
02:57:48 and like a couple of them formed
02:57:50 beautiful friendships that continue to this day
02:57:52 I gotta tell you a bunch of
02:57:54 watching that show with you
02:57:56 a couple of more fucking
02:57:58 assholes though one or two of them were shitty
02:58:00 but just like watching some of these
02:58:02 kind of shittier people
02:58:04 make great comics and like bloom
02:58:06 it was like awesome it felt so good
02:58:08 to watch people be like
02:58:10 forced to get their shit together
02:58:12 and they did and then they won
02:58:14 oh man it was awesome like Maki
02:58:16 Maki was so cool
02:58:18 Maki wasn't my favorite
02:58:20 he's the first guy I thought of
02:58:22 thought of my head
02:58:24 Katie Rice was the best by the way
02:58:26 Katie Rice for life
02:58:28 alright you guys are getting too specific
02:58:30 I'm sorry
02:58:32 I've seen hundreds of
02:58:34 reality shows I know this
02:58:36 because I made a list of every TV show I've ever seen recently
02:58:38 and I was deeply disturbed
02:58:40 by a lot of the shows I had to include
02:58:42 on my list as having seen
02:58:44 the worst one
02:58:46 this was the absolute bottom of
02:58:48 the barrel show on my entire list
02:58:50 the one that I was the most ashamed to have seen one episode of
02:58:52 and Jesse
02:58:54 I feel like you've I think you've made
02:58:56 reference to this show before
02:58:58 rock of love with Brett Michaels
02:59:00 oh jeez
02:59:02 I don't know
02:59:04 if that's the spin off of Flavor of Love
02:59:06 or if it's the other way around
02:59:08 it was a spin off of Flavor of Love
02:59:10 yeah
02:59:12 well they all come from each other
02:59:14 like Brett and Michael's show came from Flavor of Flavishow
02:59:16 which came from the surreal life season 3
02:59:18 they all spin out of each other
02:59:20 it's a night tequila tequila one
02:59:22 a self perpetuating night tear
02:59:24 night tequila's from that too
02:59:26 I love New York
02:59:28 there
02:59:30 I've seen a lot of these fucking shows
02:59:32 because my mom has always been
02:59:34 really into just all of it
02:59:36 she'll watch all of it and the thing is
02:59:38 I think that the reason that reality shows are so popular
02:59:40 because I cannot
02:59:42 I cannot
02:59:44 tolerate them
02:59:46 every second of it is pain for me
02:59:48 and the reason is that they are
02:59:50 edited so fucking awkwardly
02:59:52 where like
02:59:54 you can just hear
02:59:56 they try to make it look real
02:59:58 but the more you know about filmmaking
03:00:00 the more you can't believe any of it
03:00:02 the thing that really gets me every time
03:00:04 is like how fucking obviously
03:00:06 they're manipulating your emotions
03:00:08 like if these things happen in real life it'd be like
03:00:10 oh he said this to me
03:00:12 even on like a production level
03:00:14 it's like you see all these people
03:00:16 and sometimes you're like
03:00:18 how can they have audio that good from where they are
03:00:20 like there's parts in Survivor
03:00:22 where they'll be out in the water
03:00:24 right and then they'll be talking to each other
03:00:26 but they'll film it from an angle where you can't see
03:00:28 their faces and they'll have
03:00:30 a conversation that
03:00:32 I know as someone who knows
03:00:34 how to make film you can't
03:00:36 have that conversation with that audio
03:00:38 because the only way to do it would be
03:00:40 if they had lapel mics and those wouldn't
03:00:42 survive in the water
03:00:44 the way that they're in the water
03:00:46 and the reason they're not filming them from the front
03:00:48 is because they're ADR'ing those lines in
03:00:50 they're adding in later
03:00:52 there's so much stuff that's falsified
03:00:54 or fake or it's edited weirdly
03:00:56 where they'll have someone giving like a speech
03:00:58 and you can hear where each part of the
03:01:00 sentence that they're saying is not one
03:01:02 sentence but you can tell that it's stitched together
03:01:04 I hear you dude I just have to defend
03:01:06 because the best one
03:01:08 the other example I know Ben was going to give
03:01:10 was the pickup artist
03:01:12 which is
03:01:14 that is the other one I was going to say
03:01:16 me and Ben were into that for a time back in the day
03:01:18 and this show was so
03:01:20 it was so important to me to see
03:01:22 it was powerfully emotional
03:01:24 it was the story of a bunch of
03:01:26 scared, helpless men
03:01:28 trying to make their
03:01:30 carve out a little piece of happiness for
03:01:32 themselves in the world and watching their growth
03:01:34 over the course of this series and them
03:01:36 becoming real fucking human beings
03:01:38 was beautiful and it was completely
03:01:40 real and the emotions that
03:01:42 mystery felt when they had to leave
03:01:44 it was like when they had to kick a guy out
03:01:46 it was like they're casting about
03:01:48 lonely men these were lonely men in need
03:01:50 of help but like the rules of the competition
03:01:52 dictated it one of them had to be
03:01:54 like it was hosted by mystery
03:01:56 mystery was like sad and emotional
03:01:58 when he had to kick some of them off
03:02:00 there's a huge gradient in quality between them
03:02:02 not all of them are equally terrible
03:02:04 I've always heard that RuPaul's Drag Race
03:02:06 is kind of like what you guys just described
03:02:08 where it's like a way more emotional and like
03:02:10 legit feeling show
03:02:12 it's just that so much of reality TV
03:02:14 is
03:02:16 like creating the same kind of
03:02:18 narratives that you could get anyways
03:02:20 like from a well made
03:02:22 show but trying to
03:02:24 make it well made god damn it
03:02:26 the idea the idea is
03:02:28 hey hey it's just as good
03:02:30 a narrative as a regular TV show
03:02:32 but it's real so that makes it better
03:02:34 except it feels even less real
03:02:36 because I can see the seams
03:02:38 so easily like every little thing
03:02:40 there's no seams in the pickup artist god damn it
03:02:42 look look okay I hear what you're saying and let's say that that's
03:02:44 true but the thing is though these
03:02:46 men were actually helped
03:02:48 by this show real good
03:02:50 was done to the world
03:02:52 I don't doubt that some of them are more real than others
03:02:54 and I will say that if we're doing
03:02:56 net shows my favorite one is
03:02:58 Thumbs Up which is a series
03:03:00 about these two Korean guys
03:03:02 who like um
03:03:04 stick their thumbs up and show their butts is that what it's about
03:03:06 no it's a pretty low budget
03:03:08 it's like a low budget internet
03:03:10 show where it was about these two guys hitchhiking
03:03:12 across the US and they did like
03:03:14 three seasons of it were like the first season
03:03:16 is they had to make it from
03:03:18 like from like Vegas
03:03:20 all the way to Florida only
03:03:22 hitchhiking or only taking free rides like they would
03:03:24 they would train hop a lot and do all this
03:03:26 like a like sleeping weird
03:03:28 fucking like run down places
03:03:30 in the middle of nowhere and like but their camera
03:03:32 man would travel like individually
03:03:34 like he would film them sometimes
03:03:36 on the road and then he would like drive to
03:03:38 stuff like that
03:03:40 and then they did one season where they went from
03:03:42 Texas to Alaska
03:03:44 and then the last like the third season
03:03:46 they crossed China all the way through hitchhiking
03:03:48 alone and I don't know if they ever did more
03:03:50 but like I don't know if that counts as
03:03:52 reality TV but it was definitely in the
03:03:54 vein of it but it was
03:03:56 show is probably don't count just cause like
03:03:58 I was talking about like the
03:04:00 shit that's on like network TV
03:04:02 like my mom watches like fucking
03:04:04 matchmaker which is fucking garbage
03:04:06 you know maybe we got a little way from Thomas
03:04:08 it's yeah well
03:04:10 I think it's worth mentioning those other shows
03:04:12 just because of the fact that
03:04:14 those like that shows how like
03:04:16 cause they're obviously inspired by reality TV
03:04:18 these internet shows that are much better
03:04:20 internet shows I just my internet cut out
03:04:22 everyone stop what's been said in the last
03:04:24 minute I didn't my internet died
03:04:26 taboo dude just
03:04:28 just calm down it's just nothing's
03:04:30 been said I
03:04:32 I thought it was a real thing of any
03:04:34 important thing I can't get into so
03:04:36 so yeah
03:04:38 I was gonna
03:04:40 wait until there was a good time I'm a big fan of
03:04:42 naked and afraid I want to talk about
03:04:44 how great that show is
03:04:46 from like a something about
03:04:48 it you know from a concept is amazing from
03:04:50 a philosophical standpoint it just touches
03:04:52 something primal deep inside me I mean
03:04:54 like this the whole concept of the
03:04:56 you take a man a woman they get naked
03:04:58 in the jungle they have to survive you know there's nothing sexual about it but then they
03:05:01 get to that point where it's at night and they got
03:05:03 a cuddle and they got a spoon and that's just
03:05:05 profoundly beautiful you know
03:05:07 that's what it's all about
03:05:09 that's what I've always wanted to watch
03:05:11 that's like my ideal vision for what the world should be
03:05:13 I think we should all be naked and afraid together
03:05:15 as opposed to
03:05:17 clothed and depressed alone
03:05:19 when the third impact
03:05:21 when the third impact comes
03:05:23 all this left are naked
03:05:25 Jesse and Fluttershy they will comfort
03:05:27 each other in each other's arms
03:05:29 or hooves and it will be beautiful
03:05:31 you know right taboo what was the thing you can't get into
03:05:33 yeah well I was thinking of
03:05:35 extreme makeover home addition
03:05:37 and that reminded me of something I can't get into
03:05:39 oh like house flipping shows
03:05:41 that one is all about like hey we need
03:05:43 there's this really tragic story
03:05:45 of this family and they have a shitty house and everyone
03:05:47 the entire universe comes together
03:05:49 to build them an amazing house
03:05:51 that show is literally like
03:05:53 everything every single element
03:05:55 of emotional manipulation you can
03:05:57 possibly imagine packed into one show
03:05:59 but there's two things about it
03:06:01 that really really get under
03:06:03 my skin about is the fact that
03:06:05 they have these kids in the show you know the kids
03:06:07 who were part of the family and they always
03:06:09 build them a room
03:06:11 that looks exactly like everything that
03:06:13 they want at that exact moment
03:06:15 which not only will they be embarrassed
03:06:17 to have when they're an adult
03:06:19 they'll be embarrassed to have next year
03:06:21 I hear you dude I hear you on this but that's just one
03:06:23 that always bothered me but then after watching
03:06:25 the show more I realized oh wait
03:06:27 wait hold on for a second here
03:06:29 these are people who are dirt broke
03:06:31 they can't afford this giant house
03:06:33 how is this happening
03:06:35 and I remember seeing like news stories
03:06:37 don't they like give it to them
03:06:39 well like how can they afford the bills
03:06:41 is the thing and I remember seeing
03:06:43 like I remember my mom saying there's like a news
03:06:45 story of like oh yeah one year later
03:06:47 this totally broke family is even more
03:06:49 broke having to pay property taxes
03:06:51 on this three-story house
03:06:53 oh dude and so one of the what here's what I
03:06:55 think one of the best things you can do is look
03:06:57 up the follow-ups of all reality show
03:06:59 people yeah nightmares there's a whole
03:07:01 website dedicated to what happened
03:07:03 to every kitchen nightmares
03:07:05 right they all become famous
03:07:07 yeah so this is what I can't get into
03:07:09 charity imagine the idea
03:07:11 of giving someone something I just think is
03:07:13 so imprecise so hard to figure out
03:07:15 the idea of giving
03:07:17 anything it's just like if someone gives
03:07:19 me something I'm like I can't more hardcore
03:07:21 you know I can't like if someone
03:07:23 gives me something I'm like I don't I wish you
03:07:25 give me this like it would have been better for everyone
03:07:27 if I feel the total opposite
03:07:29 I want everyone to give me everything
03:07:31 all the time please go to
03:07:33 patreon.com
03:07:35 everyone
03:07:37 I don't think I ever
03:07:39 everyone except for DeVoo because
03:07:41 we want money or not
03:07:43 I want absolutely everything
03:07:45 that anyone wants to give me I will
03:07:47 absolutely accept
03:07:49 a Lannister takes
03:07:51 what is that a thing they say
03:07:53 or takes what is
03:07:55 given I'm pretty sure
03:07:57 there's a good reason to give
03:07:59 but when I'm talking
03:08:01 about stuff like Christmas did you an elephant
03:08:03 never forgets that's not
03:08:05 I said pays his debts god damn it
03:08:07 the elephant family lives
03:08:09 in the southern islands
03:08:11 they're not from up
03:08:15 I'm 90% sure
03:08:17 and said a Lannister takes what is you know that's
03:08:19 interesting DeVoo I feel differently
03:08:21 I like the idea of charity
03:08:23 I just will never do it because I don't give a fuck
03:08:25 about anyone besides me
03:08:27 I'll definitely take you know
03:08:29 with Christmas
03:08:31 there's definitely an element of that to it Nate
03:08:33 but I'm also very distrustful
03:08:35 of the people that take charity
03:08:37 like I don't I do not trust
03:08:39 let's get to the heart of the matter
03:08:41 even if they offer me
03:08:43 even if they offer me statistics claiming
03:08:45 everyone without fail operates
03:08:47 in self interest whether they admit it or not
03:08:49 and every charity is there to make
03:08:51 at the very least to make you feel good about
03:08:53 doing it that is an unquestionable fact
03:08:55 if you want to give to a charity
03:08:57 do you want to feel about it
03:08:59 just put like a hundred dollars in your pocket
03:09:01 and walk around Chicago for an hour
03:09:03 and dole it out to bums
03:09:05 yeah the poor community will have that money
03:09:07 at least Lynn
03:09:09 at least you know that it's going to someone
03:09:11 like yeah
03:09:13 even if it's someone who's panhandling
03:09:15 who's like not a real bum
03:09:17 you know it's going to him
03:09:19 he earned it to have that money disappear out of your
03:09:21 wallet like that
03:09:23 it's not going to be an entrepreneur
03:09:25 something the way by the Susan G. Coleman foundation
03:09:27 to pay for their pink helmets and their stupid wrist bands
03:09:29 it's not even that like okay look
03:09:31 Patreon that's like
03:09:33 I mean that's it kind of belongs
03:09:35 in the same realm as like
03:09:37 your friends with someone and you go to dinner
03:09:39 and you pay the tab sometimes and sometimes they do
03:09:41 there's this there's like this
03:09:43 unwritten exchange
03:09:45 of benefit to one another
03:09:47 that you give that's what Patreon is
03:09:49 well that's why
03:09:51 the idea behind
03:09:53 charity is that
03:09:55 there is also
03:09:57 an unspoken thing which is that you
03:09:59 elevate someone's life and then
03:10:01 they no longer are fighting
03:10:03 and squalor to eat
03:10:05 and then maybe they turn out to be a great
03:10:07 artist because they can finally pursue their passions
03:10:09 but why don't they just fucking deal with it
03:10:11 like fuck them I don't care
03:10:13 I don't care about anything
03:10:15 well it's just it's like to me the
03:10:17 whole idea of
03:10:19 uplifting the lower
03:10:21 members of our society is that
03:10:23 it might benefit me in the long run
03:10:25 you're absolutely right and if I could
03:10:27 better everyone immediately however
03:10:29 I am not willing to lose even a single
03:10:31 cent of my own money to do so
03:10:33 I mean I don't blame you I don't
03:10:35 think it's necessarily true that
03:10:37 you're automatically like
03:10:39 I don't think that
03:10:41 the only means to the end of
03:10:43 people being better is giving them money
03:10:45 sometimes it means to that end
03:10:47 by the way I think no place on being a good person
03:10:49 I can't become a fan of
03:10:51 it's like something the idea of giving
03:10:53 something is like it's just one
03:10:55 of many great things to do
03:10:57 but it's not something that I ever think of
03:10:59 as something that's good in itself
03:11:01 and I think that the whole idea of like Christmas gifts
03:11:03 to adults doesn't work at least
03:11:05 for me there's just nothing
03:11:07 that anyone can find me
03:11:09 oh my god Christmas
03:11:11 Christmas gifts is such a
03:11:13 fucking like flash
03:11:15 here's what it is here's my theory about Christmas gifts
03:11:17 stupid waste of everybody
03:11:19 the whole tradition of giving people
03:11:21 gifts on Christmas was invented back in
03:11:23 like you know the 1800s
03:11:25 back when everyone made everything by hand
03:11:27 so that made a lot of sense
03:11:29 today everyone just buys stuff
03:11:31 so it doesn't make it doesn't make a difference
03:11:33 but I just want to say I like
03:11:35 I kind of like the idea of giving gifts on some
03:11:37 level just because oftentimes
03:11:39 you like will under no other
03:11:41 circumstances will you ever give the people you care about
03:11:43 anything I know that's true of me
03:11:45 I never give anyone anything
03:11:47 I'm forced to do nice things
03:11:49 for people I really do I really do
03:11:51 I feel like you would give gifts more
03:11:53 if there weren't obligations
03:11:55 to do so maybe maybe
03:11:57 I don't think I would
03:11:59 I would never give anyone anything
03:12:01 I had a fun moment
03:12:03 when I like once I was old enough
03:12:05 to have my own money and then Christmas
03:12:07 rolled around it was like exciting because it's like
03:12:09 an expression of the fact that I'm an adult
03:12:11 with his own income now that I can buy things
03:12:13 for people sure yeah
03:12:15 the person here just likes being nice
03:12:17 sometimes yes you're the only one
03:12:19 yeah probably
03:12:21 I just gave Hippo 116
03:12:23 dollars for his playing ticket
03:12:25 but Tom you're really doing it for yourself though aren't you
03:12:27 just to feel good about doing it
03:12:29 I'm not criticizing you
03:12:31 I think there's an element of both
03:12:33 in there
03:12:35 I'm going to visit my friend this week
03:12:37 and I'm giving her a computer
03:12:39 she doesn't have one so I'm giving her one
03:12:41 you're giving her one what
03:12:43 so you're going to smash that press right
03:12:45 I assume that's what's going on
03:12:47 I don't think of giving stuff to your friends
03:12:49 as being in the same realm as charity
03:12:51 because when you're giving stuff to your friends
03:12:53 it's deepening your bond
03:12:55 you're all sucking each other's dicks
03:12:57 and getting a good heart blowing
03:12:59 if you just give money to some kid
03:13:01 it's not going to suck your dick
03:13:03 what the hell kids suck my dick already
03:13:05 he got hit in explosion
03:13:07 and he doesn't have lips anymore
03:13:09 I bet even if he sucked my dick he wouldn't be good at it
03:13:11 personally though I just have an obligation
03:13:13 because my name is Digi Bro
03:13:15 and like the first time I did something
03:13:17 nice for someone after changing my name to that
03:13:19 they said like man he really
03:13:21 earned the bro in his name
03:13:23 and ever since then I feel like I have to do something
03:13:25 really nice for somebody every couple of months
03:13:27 so that I live up to Digi Bro
03:13:29 just so that more people will say that
03:13:31 Digi Bro give me some of that sweet Patreon
03:13:33 yeah
03:13:35 like I said I gave some to Hippo
03:13:37 but that was a sweet crunchy roll box
03:13:39 actually
03:13:41 4 or 5 months from now don't worry about it
03:13:45 everybody needs to get your plane tickets
03:13:47 by the way Hippo and DeVoo already have this
03:13:49 wait have we made a total announcement
03:13:51 about Radcon 2016
03:13:53 should we need to?
03:13:55 we don't need to
03:13:57 let's leave it a mystery for now
03:13:59 that's going to be too much of a mystery
03:14:01 you guys are just all going to
03:14:03 hey everybody we're going to have a
03:14:05 you're going to have a conference at my house
03:14:07 in September
03:14:09 by the way it's not a convention
03:14:11 it's not a real convention
03:14:13 none of you people listening are invited
03:14:15 don't get the wrong idea
03:14:17 it's Radconference
03:14:19 I'm considering a conference or a summit
03:14:21 but not a convention
03:14:23 in case anyone doesn't get the joke
03:14:25 Radcon Conrad
03:14:27 is a Digi's house
03:14:29 that's brilliant isn't it
03:14:31 someone still doesn't get it
03:14:33 who the fuck is Conrad
03:14:35 I feel like you're explaining it
03:14:37 made it way worse
03:14:39 anybody have anything else
03:14:41 we've been going for 3 hours
03:14:43 10 minutes
03:14:45 all I brought up was country
03:14:47 and classical music
03:14:49 and I guess old things
03:14:51 everyone in this chat is very mad
03:14:53 let's hear it
03:14:55 as soon as you said things that I didn't like
03:14:57 this was the first thing that came to mind
03:14:59 and I knew if I said it I'd get a mystery for it
03:15:01 oh boy
03:15:03 I want to hear it
03:15:05 it's punishingly difficult video games in the vein of Dark Souls
03:15:07 I fucking hate it
03:15:09 well that's an oxymoronic statement right there
03:15:11 Dark Souls is not punishing
03:15:13 how have you not heard the 5 million videos
03:15:15 that people have come out with saying Dark Souls
03:15:17 isn't punishingly difficult
03:15:19 this is a misunderstanding
03:15:21 how have you not heard that 5 times yet
03:15:23 yeah how
03:15:25 you fucking geek
03:15:27 well there you go
03:15:29 that's not how you do it
03:15:31 why are you even living if you're not playing Dark Souls
03:15:33 nothing in life is ever giving me joy
03:15:35 except for Dark Souls
03:15:37 punishingly difficult that's such a hacky phrase
03:15:39 I'm so sick of
03:15:41 punishing like what does it mean to be punished
03:15:43 does it literally spank you after you lose
03:15:45 there's no such thing as punishingly difficult
03:15:47 I hate that term by the way
03:15:49 wait wait hold on
03:15:51 you are fucking wrong
03:15:53 there is such thing as punishing
03:15:55 if you have ever played Banjo fucking Kazooie
03:15:57 when you die in that game
03:15:59 you lose every collectible you picked up in the whole level
03:16:01 and you have to start over
03:16:03 and if you lose 5 lives you have to start
03:16:05 from the fucking starting area of the game
03:16:07 it's way over punishingly difficult
03:16:09 I just hate it when Tom says it
03:16:11 I mean
03:16:13 it's such a hack
03:16:15 the best game ever
03:16:17 there's Crash Bandicoot
03:16:19 there's games like I wanna be the guy
03:16:21 which are deliberately punishingly difficult
03:16:23 so obviously punishingly difficult
03:16:25 IT is a thing but that's a Dark Souls
03:16:27 doesn't like that
03:16:29 the best game ever
03:16:31 is Banjo
03:16:33 Tui
03:16:35 I just don't think there's that many consequences
03:16:37 for dying in Dark Souls
03:16:39 the worst thing that happens
03:16:41 is you have to fight through the last
03:16:43 one minute again
03:16:45 it's fun because the combat is fun
03:16:47 so like I never feel like
03:16:49 I have to do something I don't wanna do
03:16:51 it's like oh boy
03:16:53 oh no I died and now I have to fight
03:16:55 the funnest level of all time
03:16:57 again
03:16:59 when you do it the 20th time it starts to get annoying though
03:17:01 well you shouldn't be that fucking shit
03:17:03 that takes you 20 tries
03:17:05 I'm the best gamer of all time
03:17:07 what makes Dark Souls hard to get into
03:17:09 way more than its difficulty
03:17:11 is just the steepness of its learning curve
03:17:13 the opaqueness of its UI and its systems
03:17:15 the fact that it doesn't explain how to play
03:17:17 that is definitely the hardest thing about Dark Souls
03:17:19 and I am pretty confident that Tom is at that point
03:17:21 and once you know how to play it it's fucking easy
03:17:23 welcome to the Dark Souls commentary
03:17:25 I have created a faith build
03:17:27 called Father Matosis
03:17:29 you can all tell me your sins
03:17:31 alright advice to the whole audience
03:17:33 if you want to be good at Dark Souls
03:17:35 put all of your levels into
03:17:37 vitality or not vitality
03:17:39 if it's Dark Souls 3 but vigor
03:17:41 and strength
03:17:43 just put all of it into your life and your strength
03:17:45 and then if you have a lot of life
03:17:47 then no matter how many times you get hit
03:17:49 it doesn't matter because you have a million life
03:17:51 and the enemies won't do anything to you
03:17:53 and if you have a lot of strength you kill them all in one hit
03:17:55 so then you just run through every level
03:17:57 with a huge sword
03:17:59 upgrade your weapons by the way
03:18:01 that's the other thing
03:18:03 upgrade your weapons and you're done
03:18:05 that's it
03:18:07 it's gay and so is home stuck
03:18:09 it's all bad
03:18:11 the only game that's good is the color yellow
03:18:13 Tom did you have more to say about that subject
03:18:15 before we all snapped on you
03:18:17 I mean
03:18:19 I guess to just move away from Dark Souls
03:18:21 and just like punishing the difficult games
03:18:23 quote unquote however you want to take that in general
03:18:25 I just
03:18:27 I don't like games
03:18:29 I don't like games
03:18:31 I mean
03:18:33 I play games to de-stress
03:18:35 not to get stressed
03:18:37 like there's a threshold where
03:18:39 I stop having fun that starts becoming a chore
03:18:41 and any game that goes too far
03:18:43 past that line
03:18:45 I feel like I'm just like not getting anything
03:18:47 I'm completely in agreement with you now
03:18:49 I absolutely despise punishing games
03:18:51 I just don't think of Dark Souls as
03:18:53 and I did before that's why it took so long
03:18:55 for me to play it but once I figured out how
03:18:57 it works then it was easy as fuck
03:18:59 I played Contra
03:19:01 DS and that game fucking sucked
03:19:03 cause it was just like it's impossible
03:19:05 no one can fucking beat Contra
03:19:07 you get hit once and you're dead
03:19:09 I tried playing Mega Man Zero
03:19:11 I played all of them and I loved them
03:19:13 and they were brutally difficult
03:19:15 but I beat them all just cause they were so fun
03:19:17 like
03:19:19 oh Mega Man Zero
03:19:21 I mentioned it in passing earlier
03:19:23 when everyone was yelling over each other
03:19:25 but like I legit quit Banjo-Kazooie
03:19:27 specifically I enjoyed
03:19:29 the game
03:19:31 but the way that it punishes you when you die
03:19:33 is so unbelievably severe
03:19:35 because of the fact
03:19:37 because you have to collect like for certain
03:19:39 jiggies and stuff it'll be like collect every music note
03:19:41 in the level and if you lose a life
03:19:43 you have to collect everything
03:19:45 over again like it gets rid of everything
03:19:47 you've collected and then if you lose 5 lives
03:19:49 it just arbitrarily
03:19:51 puts you in the very beginning
03:19:53 of the game like you just have to
03:19:55 walk back to where you were and it takes like
03:19:57 a long time so
03:19:59 anytime like there's certain like
03:20:01 pretty big steep difficulty curve
03:20:03 in the game where it gets pretty hard later on
03:20:05 and it's like it's not that the challenges
03:20:07 weren't fun but
03:20:09 it is an early N64 game
03:20:11 and sometimes you die to the camera
03:20:13 sometimes you die to the
03:20:15 you know like you attacked slightly off
03:20:17 from the enemy and then they hit you like there's a lot
03:20:19 of deaths that would be
03:20:21 forgivable if you were
03:20:23 instantly respawning and not losing everything
03:20:25 if we're defining punishing as just like
03:20:27 shittily designed and like
03:20:29 unreasonably
03:20:31 like a camera dad is punishing
03:20:33 well I think what Tom was talking about is
03:20:35 no reason
03:20:37 what I really mean is games
03:20:39 games that I've not having fun with
03:20:41 anymore games well I agree with that
03:20:43 I hate not fun games
03:20:45 really insightful Tom
03:20:47 I think what Tom was meaning is like
03:20:49 something harsh
03:20:51 here's the thing
03:20:53 that I feel about video games
03:20:55 is I have like an ungodly
03:20:57 amount of patience
03:20:59 I can sometimes
03:21:01 summon infinite patience
03:21:03 it must have been the way we came up
03:21:05 because I feel the same way Ben
03:21:07 okay okay like
03:21:09 like Newgrounds games that are like
03:21:11 you know the games where like you fire yourself out of a cannon
03:21:13 and like how far you go gets you more money
03:21:15 and then you use that money to buy upgrades to your
03:21:17 cannon I can spend like
03:21:19 entire days like
03:21:21 upgrading games like that
03:21:23 and like some
03:21:25 and like if I put in a significant amount of
03:21:27 effort collecting all those music notes in Banjo
03:21:29 Kazooie and I die you better
03:21:31 fucking believe I'm gonna do it all again
03:21:33 I don't care right now Ben is trying to get
03:21:35 the hundredth and final crystal and grow home
03:21:37 something that seems completely ridiculous to
03:21:39 the rest of us but he's
03:21:41 he's chugging away it's like it's a matter of
03:21:43 except for this last one it wasn't even
03:21:45 that hard okay the last like five or so
03:21:47 we're pretty fucking hard I think I love
03:21:49 hard games but only when it's
03:21:51 like every moment of it is fun
03:21:53 anyways I was just gonna say like for Ben
03:21:55 getting like the last five out of these hundred
03:21:57 like it's the bell curve of fun
03:21:59 has curved down so you're getting so little
03:22:01 fun for a time invested
03:22:03 on the one hand yes it's
03:22:05 true even if it's not fun anymore I
03:22:07 continue to do it I can't stop
03:22:09 on the other hand grow home is such a great
03:22:11 fucking game it's fun even it's fun to
03:22:13 just glide around and just being in the
03:22:15 game is enjoyable so that's still fun
03:22:17 because like there's like
03:22:19 the original Ninja Gaiden for the
03:22:21 original Xbox yeah you can't say the
03:22:23 original without meaning any
03:22:25 yes you have to say like the semi original
03:22:27 well he said for Xbox god damn it
03:22:29 he fakes me out for a second
03:22:31 yeah okay fine
03:22:33 why don't we just talk about every fucking
03:22:35 video game ever made
03:22:37 why don't we just make this an eight hour podcast
03:22:39 how about that why don't we just sit here
03:22:41 whatever Jesse do you fucking
03:22:43 you know you can you can dip out
03:22:45 and stop your recording if you watch
03:22:47 that's true holding you a gun no because
03:22:49 I wanted to make my final point I want
03:22:51 to make I want to I need to tell
03:22:53 say my final thoughts right well let us
03:22:55 get out of the way Tom hasn't been here
03:22:57 the whole time yeah trying to blow off
03:22:59 some stress from work every god fucking
03:23:01 princess Jesse over here
03:23:03 wait I want to hear about
03:23:05 I I I didn't know you guys
03:23:07 could hear me I was just muttering under
03:23:09 my I was
03:23:11 trying to
03:23:13 anybody no I uh
03:23:15 Tom I am curious
03:23:17 about this because of the fact that I know
03:23:19 you're a huge fan of like Ninja Gaiden
03:23:21 and Metal Gear Rising Revengeance
03:23:23 which by my metric are unbelievably
03:23:25 fucking hard games so
03:23:27 this is definitely not about hard games
03:23:29 Ninja Gaiden is definitely pretty difficult
03:23:31 yeah never like people were bitching
03:23:33 like when Devil May Cry 3 came out that it was super fucking
03:23:35 hard and I didn't think it was hard at all
03:23:37 like oh yeah destroyed that game
03:23:39 and everyone's like this is hard
03:23:41 so it it's
03:23:43 but like there are other games that I'll find
03:23:45 fucking really difficult so it's weird
03:23:47 and I want to like Dark Souls
03:23:49 because everybody here likes Dark Souls but
03:23:51 every time I play it I'm just not enjoying
03:23:53 the gameplay at all Tom with Tom if you played Bloodborne
03:23:55 yet are you are you leveling up
03:23:57 are you upgrading your weapons I've only played it
03:23:59 for a little bit but even just like the way
03:24:01 the game moves away your character moves the way
03:24:03 heavy heavy it takes time to get used to it
03:24:05 I don't have a ps4 anymore
03:24:07 oh yeah well I think
03:24:09 you would enjoy Bloodborne a lot more than
03:24:11 the other games because of the fact that
03:24:13 I think you might enjoy way faster
03:24:15 Dark Souls 3 because that's a lot faster as well
03:24:17 well Bloodborne in particular has
03:24:19 like a more aggressive like
03:24:21 Metal Gear Rising or
03:24:23 or like
03:24:25 Devil May Cry-esque feel to it
03:24:27 I don't know if anyone's going to disagree
03:24:29 with me on that I had this very long
03:24:31 argument in the past about
03:24:33 how I think Bloodborne is
03:24:35 after watching that video of Matthew Matosis
03:24:37 analyzing the first Devil May Cry it looks
03:24:39 a lot like Bloodborne in the sort of
03:24:41 yeah it has the same like I
03:24:43 yeah like the attack animations
03:24:45 I definitely see where you're coming from
03:24:47 like even though it plays like Dark Souls
03:24:49 it's a lot faster and it's
03:24:51 less punishing on your health where enemies just
03:24:53 do less damage and it's
03:24:55 more about regaining health because like
03:24:57 in that game every time an enemy hits you
03:24:59 if you hit them back within a certain
03:25:01 amount of time then you regain all the health
03:25:03 that they took from you which is a great
03:25:05 mechanic yeah which is a lot like Metal Gear Rising
03:25:07 where if you
03:25:09 kill enemies in a certain way you regain your health
03:25:11 so it's got some of that
03:25:13 spectacle fighter aspect to it while
03:25:15 still being the free form
03:25:17 open world RPG that Dark Souls is
03:25:19 and I think that
03:25:21 Bloodborne in spite of being
03:25:23 I don't think it's easier than the other games
03:25:25 but I think it's so much easier
03:25:27 to get the point and be like oh yeah
03:25:29 this is fun which is why
03:25:31 Aaron Hansen got into the Souls series
03:25:33 through that game because he totally
03:25:35 didn't get the point until that one and then it was like
03:25:37 oh now it all makes sense and then went back
03:25:39 and played all the others and that's how I
03:25:41 experienced it too so
03:25:43 maybe Bloodborne would be a good entry point
03:25:45 for you if you ever find a chance to play it
03:25:47 I need to get a PS4 again at some point
03:25:49 because now there's actually games coming out again
03:25:51 Did you like sell it to Nate or something?
03:25:53 I sold it to Nate because you wanted to get the new Kingdom Hearts
03:25:55 because you were hyped for Kingdom Hearts
03:25:57 Oh like that's gonna happen
03:25:59 you're gonna need the PS4K by the time that fucking
03:26:01 game comes out
03:26:03 possible possible
03:26:05 specifically because I remember going out
03:26:07 I believe I got the PS4 from you
03:26:09 specifically because Bloodborne was coming out
03:26:11 and I wanted to be there
03:26:13 Hey Nate remember that time you bought the PS3 for Kingdom Hearts
03:26:15 I do remember that
03:26:17 I remember buying, I have a purge in my life
03:26:19 three PS3's with the intention of playing
03:26:21 Kingdom Hearts 3
03:26:23 oh god just fucking kill me
03:26:27 Why did you betray me Square Enix
03:26:29 Why would you do this to me
03:26:31 Shit in the fucking head
03:26:33 Yeah, yeah I'm rolling in my fucking grave right now
03:26:35 Jesus Christ
03:26:37 Alright Jesse
03:26:39 I got, yeah
03:26:41 Okay
03:26:43 Well, well guys
03:26:45 It sure has been a great podcast
03:26:47 but it's time for my final thoughts
03:26:49 It's time to nuke this baby
03:26:51 It's been great being friends with you all
03:26:53 but it's time for my final thoughts
03:26:55 on yellow
03:26:57 Yeah, okay
03:26:59 I don't have the energy
03:27:01 I don't have the energy to talk to you anymore
03:27:03 This is the greatest podcast I've ever been a part of
03:27:05 Guys
03:27:07 This is the most I've ever enjoyed a podcast
03:27:09 Digi, you have to give this video another
03:27:11 Yeah
03:27:13 I'm going to make the opening song
03:27:15 It's going to be Coldplay
03:27:17 I promise you
03:27:19 All the people out there in the world listen to this
03:27:21 All the, you know, impressionable youngsters
03:27:23 who may hear these people's bullshit
03:27:25 and believe it because you don't know any better
03:27:27 I just want to set you straight
03:27:29 I just want to let you know
03:27:31 yellow is actually
03:27:33 my favorite color
03:27:35 This is true, you know
03:27:37 I actually knew that
03:27:39 You know, I love
03:27:41 Starboard bow is yellow
03:27:43 Yes, right
03:27:45 I love Fluttershy
03:27:47 I love Oscar's yellow dress
03:27:49 Episode 8 of Neon Genesis
03:27:51 Who doesn't
03:27:53 I love bananas
03:27:55 I love all the yellow things
03:27:57 Yellow, such as myself
03:27:59 Yellow is 30
03:28:01 That's a fallacy
03:28:03 No, shut up
03:28:05 You don't know
03:28:07 Guys
03:28:09 I've been
03:28:11 I've been down with yellow for a long time
03:28:13 If my videos
03:28:15 If I had a video that was yellow
03:28:17 It would be because I purposely made it
03:28:19 yellow and seeing as how I did not
03:28:21 purposely make a video yellow
03:28:23 could not have been yellow
03:28:25 Did you feel when he claims that
03:28:27 I just say that I get video games more
03:28:29 than everyone else because I am the best at them
03:28:31 Yeah
03:28:33 That doesn't, you know
03:28:35 Tasting your own medicine
03:28:37 I think we all do it
03:28:39 I think we're all fucking terrible people
03:28:41 It's true
03:28:43 I'm just saying that since we've established
03:28:45 that I am the best guy
03:28:47 at determining what is yellow
03:28:49 and what is not the best guy at finding it
03:28:51 Yeah
03:28:53 If your victory for this argument
03:28:55 is that we have to accept that you
03:28:57 decide what is yellow, I'm down
03:28:59 I'm honestly down
03:29:01 I will accept that we're all going to change
03:29:03 the definition of yellow to fit Jesse's
03:29:05 definition of yellow
03:29:07 Yellow's
03:29:09 Yellos are formative
03:29:11 Yellos are formative
03:29:13 Yellos are formative
03:29:15 You know
03:29:17 Patreon one
03:29:19 Yes, Jesse
03:29:21 You know, that's one way to put it didgy
03:29:23 but you know, the more accurate way would be
03:29:25 to say that you should all be done
03:29:27 changing the definition of yellow
03:29:29 and you should go back to what it actually is
03:29:31 which is and has always been my definition
03:29:33 of yellow, which is the actual color yellow
03:29:35 not the color of my video
03:29:37 It's a simple formula, kids
03:29:39 It's a simple fact of the world
03:29:41 So what color are your videos
03:29:43 The color is normal, right?
03:29:45 Normal color
03:29:47 My videos are definitely normal
03:29:49 You know, and you know
03:29:51 And that Christmas video
03:29:53 in particular, you know
03:29:55 It was really looking normal in that one for sure
03:29:57 You know, I'm going to have to
03:29:59 I'm going to have to download
03:30:01 Dude, I just smoked some weed
03:30:03 I got to go into my color packs
03:30:05 on my computer and download normal
03:30:07 like a font pack and throw it in there
03:30:09 So I can make stuff in Jesse's
03:30:11 style if I ever need to
03:30:13 It's funny that you're trying to make
03:30:15 my argument sound so
03:30:17 go out there by claiming
03:30:19 that normal is like some color
03:30:21 that I'm saying something so crazy
03:30:23 when I just say that the video looks normal
03:30:25 It looks how the human eye actually detects
03:30:27 what the world looks like
03:30:29 I'm not talking to rocket science
03:30:31 in rooms with fluorescent light
03:30:33 It does look like what a podcast has been
03:30:35 I see such a fucking gauntlet
03:30:37 I can't believe it's still happening
03:30:39 Why to you
03:30:41 Is it yellow?
03:30:43 Is my question
03:30:45 Is it just because it's not actually
03:30:47 full yellow? There is a delta
03:30:49 in the yellow value of the image
03:30:51 Right there, he said it people
03:30:53 You heard it right from the horse's mouth
03:30:55 Just because it's not yellow doesn't mean
03:30:57 it's not yellow You don't understand how color works
03:30:59 in fucking video goddammit
03:31:01 There's a gulf between the yellowness
03:31:03 These guys are saying it's something
03:31:05 These guys argument that because it's not
03:31:07 ROY G BIF
03:31:09 ROY G BIF
03:31:11 ROY G BIF
03:31:13 There it is, we all live in our own realities
03:31:15 We all have our own
03:31:17 ideas about the world
03:31:19 And if one of us thinks
03:31:21 that one thing is yellow
03:31:23 and everyone else thinks it's something else
03:31:25 We can't tell that person they're wrong
03:31:27 Really, I mean we can say that they don't
03:31:29 agree with the general consensus
03:31:31 But it's no different than saying that something
03:31:33 is good
03:31:35 Good is in the eye of the beholder
03:31:37 Yellow is in the eye
03:31:39 of the beholder of yellow
03:31:41 We can't tell a man what is or isn't yellow
03:31:43 We can only tell him what we perceive
03:31:45 And just as some people might say
03:31:47 well there's a god
03:31:49 And therefore morality is determined
03:31:51 by what my god says
03:31:53 The next guy who doesn't believe in that god
03:31:55 will say you're wrong
03:31:57 And neither one you can really
03:31:59 say is right
03:32:01 I mean you can have scientific observations
03:32:03 to back your claims
03:32:05 But who's to say that science is correct
03:32:07 So there's really no way of disproving
03:32:09 that the beholder isn't yellow
03:32:11 by each individual person's standards
03:32:13 Roy G Biv
03:32:15 Introduce yourself to my buddy Roy G Biv
03:32:17 Jesse, I was going to teach you a thing or two
03:32:19 You ever played Smash Bros
03:32:21 when you're winning with Roy and the Kraus
03:32:23 by devolving into chaos
03:32:25 But what they don't realize is that I am prepared
03:32:27 to do this all day
03:32:29 Jesse, I will make a ten hour podcast
03:32:31 The Endless Podcast
03:32:33 Okay, Jesse, I have a question
03:32:35 that can be answered with yes, no, or
03:32:37 no
03:32:39 Okay, I'll give you the question, alright
03:32:43 In that visualization
03:32:45 that I showed you where I compared the colors
03:32:47 of your face and your beard and your eye
03:32:49 from a natural lighting shot
03:32:51 to a fluorescent lighting shot
03:32:53 and you see the individual colors
03:32:55 and there's the color on the left
03:32:57 is the color in your basement
03:32:59 Are those colors
03:33:01 more yellow, yes, less
03:33:03 yellow or the same amount of yellow
03:33:05 Does he even have that image?
03:33:07 The same amount of yellow to view, which is none
03:33:09 None yellow, okay
03:33:11 That's objectively
03:33:13 incorrect, yeah
03:33:15 You realize that light is made out of a combinate
03:33:17 There's one thing that really
03:33:19 I feel like we have a different opinion on what is a color
03:33:21 We need to get to the root
03:33:23 of this whole thing
03:33:25 Here's the problem though
03:33:27 I want to be able to
03:33:29 tell Jesse that there's a spectrum of light
03:33:31 by saying that light
03:33:33 Oh, there's a spectrum, alright, and he's on it
03:33:39 But the only problem, the reason why
03:33:41 that argument isn't going to work
03:33:43 is that the light spectrum is red, green, and blue
03:33:45 so it doesn't involve yellow
03:33:47 so he's going to not even accept that
03:33:49 as an argument
03:33:51 Don't computer monitors use like
03:33:53 blue, purple
03:33:55 monitors only use
03:33:57 monitors is RGB
03:33:59 It's cyan, yellow, magenta
03:34:01 spectrum
03:34:03 We've experienced the entire spectrum
03:34:05 in this podcast for sure
03:34:07 That's what happens when we all come together
03:34:09 It's true
03:34:11 Maybe all of our different perceptions of colors
03:34:13 is determined by our different levels of autism
03:34:15 Maybe that's why we don't all see it
03:34:17 Yeah, exactly
03:34:19 I have no autism
03:34:21 and so I
03:34:23 I don't see any yellow because I'm not autistic
03:34:25 unlike the rest of you
03:34:27 That's exactly right, did you
03:34:29 That picture that you made
03:34:31 Yes, obviously
03:34:33 the colors in the two pictures were different
03:34:35 but neither of them were yellow
03:34:37 in any way
03:34:39 Jesse, so are you saying that the other one looks blue to you?
03:34:41 No, what the fuck?
03:34:43 Because if something is less yellow
03:34:45 it's more blue
03:34:47 I had a feeling we were going to get to this
03:34:49 at some point and it was going to make it even worse
03:34:53 Light comes in two forms, yellow and blue light
03:34:55 Those are the two kinds of light
03:34:57 No, you idiot
03:34:59 Light comes in one form
03:35:01 White or else it's dark
03:35:03 No, there's a rainbow
03:35:05 of color
03:35:07 There's a rainbow, but the thing is
03:35:09 when light is normal, light is really shy
03:35:11 the colors are really shy
03:35:13 You need a prism which excites them
03:35:15 and makes them feel emboldened in their actions
03:35:17 It's like alcohol for people
03:35:19 This is like teaching
03:35:21 kindergartners
03:35:23 You guys are trying
03:35:25 to use alcohol as an example
03:35:27 Jesse, do you think that
03:35:29 just because that image
03:35:31 captured by your camera
03:35:33 is what it looked like in real life
03:35:35 does that to you mean that it isn't yellow?
03:35:37 No, Ben
03:35:39 What makes it not look like yellow is the fact
03:35:41 that it does not look like yellow
03:35:43 I'm looking at my room right now
03:35:45 I don't know why this is so complicated
03:35:47 for you people to grasp
03:35:49 I don't know how anyone can be this retarded
03:35:51 that you people just can't understand
03:35:53 that it simply does not look like yellow
03:35:55 that it simply does not look like yellow
03:35:57 This is not rocket science
03:35:59 This is not open heart surgery
03:36:01 It does not
03:36:03 I repeat, does not
03:36:05 look like yellow
03:36:07 I just don't believe in this idea that there is a
03:36:09 normal look
03:36:11 like everything is affected by the light source
03:36:13 that is on it
03:36:15 Jesse, I'm gonna fucking take this picture
03:36:17 Jesse, I'm gonna print this picture out
03:36:19 and take it around
03:36:21 and fucking Steve Harvey game shows
03:36:23 Ben, that's pointless
03:36:25 and go around to 100 people
03:36:27 on the screen and be like
03:36:29 what fucking color does this look like
03:36:31 and 99 out of 100
03:36:33 will look like you're a crazy person
03:36:35 because it doesn't look like a color
03:36:37 it looks like a fucking picture of a guy
03:36:39 What the hell man?
03:36:41 Pictures don't have colors
03:36:43 Dude
03:36:45 What?
03:36:47 You see, I think that most people believe this
03:36:49 I'm going to red sweater
03:36:51 I'm going to red sweater
03:36:53 I'm going to red sweater
03:36:55 I've got frost on my face
03:36:57 The video itself is not happy
03:36:59 You guys are out of your fucking minds
03:37:01 There is no way to prove or disprove
03:37:03 someone else's reality as
03:37:05 I am less real than you
03:37:07 So it's always an argument that everyone's
03:37:09 perceiving a reality as a fight
03:37:11 and there's no victory
03:37:13 There's no way to convince someone else that
03:37:15 they're seeing something wrong
03:37:17 Yeah
03:37:21 So I don't think there's such thing
03:37:23 as an objective truth about what's yellow
03:37:25 Like I said, yellow is
03:37:27 And it's one or the other
03:37:29 Neither is helping your case
03:37:31 A cacophony
03:37:33 It's a cacophony of sound, that's true
03:37:35 But we do it, it's a cacophony
03:37:37 Yeah
03:37:39 You know, the burden of proof is on you guys
03:37:41 I'm proving it
03:37:43 This is more evidence
03:37:45 I'm taking the color of your face
03:37:47 in the basement videos
03:37:49 and then I have a list of shades of yellow
03:37:51 and there's one shade of yellow in particular
03:37:53 that's pretty ding...
03:37:55 I know but it's pretty ding similar
03:37:57 out of only like 30 that are listed
03:37:59 Here's what I'm going to do
03:38:01 I'm going to take the picture
03:38:03 I'm going to put it in fucking manga studio
03:38:05 I'm going to blend the entire picture
03:38:07 into a single solid hue
03:38:09 and then I'm going to post that hue and you guys are going to look at it
03:38:11 and tell me what color does it fucking look like
03:38:13 I'm going to fucking see that
03:38:15 It's almost like if you change the picture
03:38:17 it'll be something different
03:38:19 It's not going to work, Jesse won't believe it
03:38:21 because you altered the picture, it's not real
03:38:23 I'm only going to use the blur tool
03:38:25 and nothing more
03:38:27 and I don't care if Jesse doesn't find that valid
03:38:29 It's not valid
03:38:31 I think everyone's desperation to win this
03:38:33 is really fucking hilarious
03:38:35 What's your response to this?
03:38:37 I want your rebuttal of this
03:38:39 This is a shade of yellow that looks very similar
03:38:41 to your skin in your basement videos
03:38:43 No, that's a shade of skin
03:38:45 that looks similar to my skin
03:38:47 You dumb fuck
03:38:49 Hey guys, guess what, Jesse
03:38:51 You're promoting racism because skin used to be a name of a color
03:38:53 for Crayola crowns
03:38:55 Skin, which is white people skin
03:38:57 that was racist
03:38:59 so they got rid of it
03:39:01 You're saying that yellow looks normal
03:39:03 because your skin is tangy
03:39:05 Your logic is getting pretty out there
03:39:07 How else am I supposed to rebut, Jesse
03:39:09 You're not supposed to rebut it
03:39:11 because there is no rebuttal
03:39:13 Jesse doesn't think it's yellow
03:39:15 Nothing is going to change that
03:39:17 We're all insane for arguing with him
03:39:19 but I find it so funny
03:39:21 that I can't stop
03:39:23 and I've also wasted
03:39:25 and I just love this podcast
03:39:27 I'm shocked, I'm shocked and appalled
03:39:29 by your guys insistence
03:39:31 on trying to rationalize your insane belief
03:39:33 that this fucking picture of me
03:39:35 is yellow
03:39:37 It's not in comparison
03:39:39 It has a yellow
03:39:41 hue tint to it
03:39:43 There's an overture of yellow
03:39:45 It's not even playing songs related to this argument anymore
03:39:47 He's just playing She's So Heavy by The Beatles
03:39:49 This conversation is fucking heavy
03:39:51 It's weighing on my soul like a fucking anchor
03:39:53 Does anybody have anything else that they can't get into?
03:39:55 Are we wrapping this up?
03:39:57 I hope this conversation haunts you all
03:39:59 for days to come
03:40:01 I hope you see my face in your nightmares
03:40:03 and I hope my face in your nightmares looks yellow
03:40:05 Motherfucker, because that's the only place
03:40:07 it's ever going to look yellow
03:40:09 is in your own sick imaginations
03:40:11 just like in your imaginations right now
03:40:13 You know what this video should mean?
03:40:15 I know how we can end this
03:40:17 I was just talking with Idol Yo-Kai
03:40:19 about this argument
03:40:21 and she says
03:40:23 that Jessi's videos look yellow
03:40:25 Oh, there you go
03:40:27 Why does that matter?
03:40:29 I'm just going to fade out this podcast
03:40:31 Why does that matter, Tom?
03:40:33 We had to sync with Tom
03:40:35 It's a funny thing that you mentioned Idol Yo-Kai
03:40:37 and I'll tell you exactly why
03:40:39 and I want everyone to gather around
03:40:41 and listen to this little tidbit
03:40:43 because Idol Yo-Kai is currently
03:40:45 drawing a picture for me
03:40:47 and I said to her
03:40:49 and this is a true story
03:40:51 I said I want my sunglasses
03:40:53 to be yellow
03:40:55 and guess what
03:40:57 Oh boy, I'm on board
03:40:59 She gave me her picture
03:41:01 and the sunglasses were wrong
03:41:03 the sunglasses were black
03:41:05 so she doesn't know what yellow is
03:41:07 Okay?
03:41:09 So I win!
03:41:11 That's it! Thank you!
03:41:13 Thank you for proving my point
03:41:15 The opening for this podcast should be
03:41:17 I win!
03:41:19 Guys, we need to sync with Tom
03:41:21 You've drawn your hat into the ring
03:41:23 with fools
03:41:25 Tom, on the count of three
03:41:27 we all say shit breaks
03:41:29 One, two, three
03:41:31 shit breaks
03:41:33 You know, what's really crazy is
03:41:35 one, two, three
03:41:37 shit breaks
03:41:39 You know what else we haven't even brought up
03:41:41 We just amplify this even more
03:41:43 Wait, everybody, everybody, everybody
03:41:45 Say goodbye
03:41:47 Bye
03:41:49 Yeah
03:41:51 I'm supposed to
03:41:53 be working
03:41:55 right now
03:41:57 But I'm not working
03:41:59 I'm doing nothing
03:42:01 My dick, I'm jerking
03:42:03 Myself, I'm sucking
03:42:05 I am an asshole
03:42:07 I am a stupid
03:42:09 I've got a deadline
03:42:11 Don't want to do it
03:42:13 I am an asshole
03:42:15 I am a stupid
03:42:17 I've got a deadline
03:42:19 Don't want to do it
03:42:31 What the hell is wrong with me?
03:42:33 I'm supposed to
03:42:35 be making money
03:42:39 I'm supposed to
03:42:41 be creating
03:42:43 funny
03:42:45 Think that the people
03:42:47 gladly will pay
03:42:49 for artistic
03:42:51 genius
03:42:53 That's what they came for
03:42:55 Instead, I'm tweeting
03:42:57 hashtag repeating
03:42:59 That's why
03:43:01 there's no heat
03:43:03 and holes in the ceiling
03:43:07 Yeah
03:43:09 It's quite the burden
03:43:11 It's a hard knock life
03:43:13 Being
03:43:15 a genius
