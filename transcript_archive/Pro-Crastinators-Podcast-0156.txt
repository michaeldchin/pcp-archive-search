00:00:00 Hello everyone, welcome to The Prolapsinators. I'm your host, Benjamin Saint of theprolapsinators.com
00:00:17 slash email. Who else is here? Question? Really fast. This is boring. Let's skip introduction
00:00:24 and get right to the meat of it, shall we? They call me Nate, and they call me Rosebud,
00:00:30 speaking of prolapsinators for a reason. If you know what I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen.
00:00:37 You know guys, I think that we aren't giving ourselves enough credit. I think that we need
00:00:41 to, when people ask us what we do, we don't have to shy away from it. We can say that
00:00:46 we are professional lapsers. I mean, we prolapse. We shouldn't be so coy about it anymore. I
00:00:52 think it's bad for the perception of us in the greater world. We let things... We lapse
00:00:57 in a lack of judgment. We lapse in a lack of skill, you know? We just lapse and we lapse
00:01:04 and it just keeps... I'm gonna lap at your fucking blood if you come at me with that
00:01:08 big old knife. Oh, you stabbed me before I could do it. Man, I should make threats I
00:01:12 can't keep. We professionally blundered over and over into this situation we find ourselves
00:01:19 in today. I would like to demonstrate something for you. Please. Because I am home alone. There
00:01:27 is absolutely no one in my apartment right now. My family is gone and they have left
00:01:34 to go see Michelle's girlfriend, Michelle's mother in Hawaii. Oh, wait. How much of that
00:01:42 is accurate? Did they go to Hawaii? Yeah, they went to Hawaii. So you're home alone, huh?
00:01:47 I've been home alone for the past week. So what are you wearing? I'm wearing briefs and
00:01:56 that's it. Yeah. All right, that's all. That did it for me. We can go to Hawaii. Munchy,
00:02:01 munchy. Yes. Why wouldn't you go to Hawaii with the rest of them? I pine for Hawaii. I've been
00:02:07 wearing my Waikiki pink and white wristband to remind me of those Halcyon days, long past,
00:02:14 and to look forward to my next trip. You can't live in the past, Nate. You've got to throw that
00:02:18 shit aside. That's fair. That's fair. Well, well, Nate, there's a very good reason for that.
00:02:22 Because they did in fact offer me to go. They were like, you know, we're going to Hawaii. This
00:02:28 was like many months ago. You want to come along, right? I was like, you know, Hawaii's sure cool,
00:02:35 but and then I take off my heart-shaped necklace trinket and I open it up the inside and I see
00:02:42 a picture of the URL to apsadventures.com. I say, there's someone else I would like to see more.
00:02:49 And so that's that's why I'm that's why I'm going to London in July instead of going to Hawaii.
00:02:54 Oh, okay. So is this like, I got it. I got it. Yes. So they they offered to pay what they would
00:03:02 have paid for Hawaii trip. Oh, that's very nice, which it was accounted to like to like one fourth
00:03:07 of the cost because going to London is really expensive. I would I would I would love to go. I
00:03:13 would love to go to London. But like you said, it's really expensive. And I just don't think I can
00:03:19 justify the cost. Okay, okay. Well, that's fine. There's okay, there's really fucked up. I don't
00:03:25 want to talk about this on the show. So is this is the hotel thing? Yes, it is the hotel thing.
00:03:32 It doesn't it doesn't change the fact that it's still like prohibitive. I want to hear it,
00:03:36 what's the deal? Okay, so this is just crazy. So I calculate the plane ticket. And it's like,
00:03:43 it's like over like $1,000, like it's really expensive. And so I just I just say out loud
00:03:49 a mile, I'm like, man, this this thing is fucking expensive. This sucks. And she's like, well,
00:03:55 let me let me let me let me try and like, let me see if I can find a good price. I'm like,
00:04:00 okay, mom. Yeah, okay, all right. And then she does it and she finds a plane ticket that has a
00:04:06 bundled hotel room inside. So you buy, you know, it's a plane ticket and combination hotel room. So
00:04:11 you get a room in a place in London. It is less with the hotel room. That's what how is that possible?
00:04:19 I have no clue. So just to reiterate viewers, the plane ticket is more than if I got a plane ticket
00:04:27 and a hotel room for the entire stay. There's got to be a racket here. Something's going on behind
00:04:32 the scenes. Back alley corruption hotel deal. I have no clue. But so obviously, I just did that,
00:04:39 obviously, because like, right, why not? And so I just have a hotel room that will be mine in London
00:04:46 that I we can just retreat to when we want to. Are you staying with Gib? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
00:04:54 And you've got a fucking hotel. Yeah, shit. It's gonna be it's gonna be great. It's gonna be like
00:04:59 Munchy can come see all of the stuff and then he can go back to the hotel at his leisure
00:05:04 when he's sick of my of me and my family. Oh, that's great. I'll never get sick. But I'm getting
00:05:11 jealous. I'm getting jealous. I've never been to England. And I can't wait. You're a good example
00:05:17 Munchy. You're setting a good example. I'm gonna be I'm gonna be way more patriotic than you are. Give
00:05:21 the entire time. It's gonna be super obnoxious. Gonna be I'm gonna be the the stereotypical American
00:05:25 tourist and it's gonna be incredible and just fawning over everything. It will be. I
00:05:29 expect and hope and pray that you are as loud as possible and scream constantly in the streets
00:05:35 drawing everyone's attention. Have you uh have you talked to Mage? Are you gonna see Mage?
00:05:40 Fucking we could easily see Mage, I think. Are you sure she won't be back in her homeland?
00:05:45 She might she might actually be back in the old Lithuania at the time because she does that for
00:05:49 summer. Oh, she does that for summer. She's going back to that desolate wasteland. Well, you should
00:05:55 ask her. You should ask her when she's going back. Yeah, definitely lock that down because that's
00:05:59 once in a lifetime opportunity right there. But wait a minute. All that to say is I'm alone right
00:06:05 now and I've I've I've obviously been I've experienced a lot of time away from my parents
00:06:12 living in Boston. But I've always had like another like human being like around you know. So it's
00:06:18 never been like I've been like like on my own. And it's really cool. Obviously, this isn't the
00:06:23 first time I've ever been like alone for like a day or anything like that. But you know, yeah,
00:06:27 there's seriously no one here like not a joke. It wasn't like a lie. It wasn't like a surprise.
00:06:33 They were going to come back, which is what I initially thought. Like, you know, there's no
00:06:36 way I'm gonna be actually alone in the house. But I am and I have to feed the dogs and I have to
00:06:40 clean up everything. And you know what, I love it. I love this is so I am so I don't I don't know
00:06:47 what to make of the fact that you find being alone in your house to be like a novel experience.
00:06:54 It's it's not a big deal, man. It's okay. Well, hold on. Let me clarify. Again, I've been alone in
00:07:01 my house before, but not like multiple consecutive days in a row. I mean, this is probably the first
00:07:07 time, at least that I can recall, I've been alone for maybe like three, four days. But this has been
00:07:12 like for the entire past week, and then like a little bit more, you know, that's very cool. That
00:07:18 reminds me of Ben. Remember how our dad, our dad got into a thing when he started sailing,
00:07:23 which he's been doing for a long time now, when he would go away for like a full week,
00:07:27 and he would go sailing with his buddy and they'd sail around like Martha's Vineyard and you know,
00:07:32 like the the Cape of Massachusetts and whatnot. Like my our mom was still there. But like our
00:07:37 house was a totally different thing without dad around. It was like fucking stay up late,
00:07:42 play video games and shit, go have pizza pies for breakfast. Holy shit. Yeah, you know, yeah.
00:07:51 And he was thoroughly lashed when he came back and found. Yeah, I mean, you got to pay the piper
00:07:55 at some point. But okay, but here's the thing. Here's the great tease of it all was that because
00:08:00 here's because he was sailing. Everything was totally dependent on the weather staying good
00:08:05 and making for good sailing conditions. That cruel moment. Again, I love my dad, but that cruel
00:08:10 moment when the when the weather is turning south and you the phone rings and here's dad,
00:08:15 son, I'm coming home, as he would say. And you know, I'll never remember his his deep baritone.
00:08:25 I'll never forget rather lost at sea one day. We'll find him again. Perhaps he should have
00:08:30 come home that one time. What a pathetic fallacy that is for the weather to to to to to punctuate
00:08:37 the dad. You know, you know, dads, they go out for they go out for a pack of sailboats and they
00:08:42 never come home. Except when you don't want them to, except when it starts to rain and then they're
00:08:48 like, ah, fuck it. Yeah. Dad always have another sexy sleepover with your friends trying to max
00:08:56 out your DDR and guitar hero scores. And in Walt is your father to call you gay and smack your ass
00:09:03 and do everything that you were praying he wouldn't in public. Honestly, I don't think a single one of
00:09:08 those like extended sailing trips lasted as long as it was scheduled to like every every single one
00:09:14 ended at least a little early. I mean, I can't even blame him. But it seemed like it was weather
00:09:19 every single time. But yeah, I mean, you know, he didn't get to do his like he was his goal was to
00:09:24 sail out to X point and then make it back. And he not once I believe did he do it. But I mean,
00:09:30 you know, you want to just do to the weather and stuff. But anyway, that was that was a liberating
00:09:34 time in life. Just this is when the when when parents are away. The kids will play. Oh, that's
00:09:41 that's correct. That's correct. The way the way my life has worked proceeding. Yes, I hope you're
00:09:46 I hope you're having a like teen boner comedy style, like invite the whole neighborhood over for a
00:09:51 big rager and you surely have it all cleaned up by the time your parents get home. But then uh oh,
00:09:56 we're coming home early because the big the big deal fell through and we're coming home and we're
00:10:01 really poor now and we're really fucking mad. Anything, even our own blood, for example. All
00:10:09 right, love you. See you soon, son. The way my life has worked. This isn't like a new found sense of
00:10:17 like responsibility or like independence in a way since I more or less live a like a life away
00:10:24 from my parents in a way where I'm always upstairs and if I'm not upstairs, then I leave the house
00:10:29 that I'm not there and they don't really have really any influence over me directly. However,
00:10:35 it is nice to have to do like a menial labor for once because I don't interact with anything
00:10:42 outside my room. And so I don't clean it because I don't interact with it literally at all. If I
00:10:47 cook something, then I clean up the kitchen. But other than that, I don't do anything. Uh and so
00:10:52 it's it's it's sort of I don't know the word's not refreshing. It's not like I'm like super psyched
00:10:58 about invigorating. Yeah, I would say so. It's like I'm taking care of my space, you know, I'm
00:11:06 taking care. I'm a real human. This is my house currently in a way that I interact with it more
00:11:13 than I have previously. And I have to feed all the animals to clean up after all the animals and
00:11:17 take them on walks and stuff. And you know, and now you'll learn to hate them as I do. Oh no,
00:11:23 I already hate them been good. There's not a I like my dogs out, you know, on the street to the
00:11:30 moon if I had my way. You know, living on my own as I have for the past many years now, it uh I
00:11:38 think that what you're describing is something I'm a big fan of. And it's it's like when you're
00:11:42 when you're a millennial youth, you're growing up in your room and like, you know, generally
00:11:46 everything's taken care of for you. You know, you got your occasional chores you got to do. But I
00:11:50 mean, at least my experience is like, my dad took care of all like the big work and he would have
00:11:54 us help sometimes. And whenever we did it, like I resented it like I didn't want to do it. It sucked.
00:11:59 Hey, let's time to time to mulch the fucking yard again. Yeah, we gotta have new mulch because
00:12:06 that old mulch just isn't cutting it. You know, gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta hold the ladder
00:12:11 while I cut down a branch of a tree that I think is that I think is kind of ugly.
00:12:16 It's the dynamics that are interesting about that because I think once you like if parents go away
00:12:23 suddenly you have to fend for yourself and like everything like you're saying, it's a total
00:12:27 different way to look at the world. It's not that like all the clockwork machinery is just keeping
00:12:32 things going, which are your parents and society and whatnot. When it's up to you, suddenly you're
00:12:36 a man in a jungle, and you've got to intimately become acquainted with that jungle and know how
00:12:41 to get food and what to do. Yeah, and it gives you kind of a native of it. Elevate it reduces you
00:12:47 from a higher level like intellectual electronically based consciousness down to an
00:12:52 earthy like Native American style in tune with nature, groundedness, you know. In the suburban
00:12:59 household. That's correct, but there's definitely a pleasure in that. Using it as a part of it.
00:13:05 It's responsibility. You feel it feels more fun to clean up the mess that you made rather than the
00:13:10 mess that you know would be cleaned up anyway. Because there's a story behind this mess. You
00:13:16 can relive all this. It's not abstract like the reason to mulch those trees was completely
00:13:23 abstract. Completely I have no idea. Completely mystifying, completely resented having to do,
00:13:29 man. Yeah. Let me just go off on a rant about this. I would always be like, I'm like, I can't
00:13:34 fucking believe I hate having to mulch these trees every fucking year with this giant pile of mulch.
00:13:39 You got to put mulch around every tree. And then it's like, and I'm like, I'm grumbling about it.
00:13:44 And dad's like, hey, hey, you got a fucking, you know, you, hey, he's like, no, you don't want to
00:13:51 smile, please. Smile, smile about this, please. Yeah, I know you don't want to do it, but you're
00:13:56 going to see, you know, you're like, once it's done, you're going to appreciate, you know, the job
00:14:00 well done. And I'm like, of course I'm not going to. I don't understand how I don't understand,
00:14:05 I don't understand how you don't understand how I don't see the same value in fresh mulch.
00:14:10 You know, I love dear old dad, but I got to say, I think it was a, it was a,
00:14:14 not to criticize his parenting, but I think it was a tactical error to not, to not be, quote,
00:14:19 a good enough father to like, to just, to simply explain to us why this activity was important
00:14:31 to him, which I mean, you know, maybe he tried and just like got frustrated and gave up, but I
00:14:35 still don't understand. Yeah, there was like a, there was sort of a thing where like, he really
00:14:42 seemed not to grasp that we did not see the value in this, in this activity. Like if I, if I was,
00:14:49 when you, when like, my son turns like 18 or whatever, like I understand and I kind of enjoy,
00:14:53 like, you know, when I do the PCP pay every month or whatever, you know, generally try to get it
00:14:57 out on time, but like, there's a certain pleasure I take in it, but I could absolutely see, let alone,
00:15:03 like my children, when they turn 18, like dealing with their taxes, but like any of you trying to
00:15:08 like, you know, go over the facts and figures, you know, some of you can enjoy it. We have talked
00:15:12 about it on occasion, but like, I totally get how it's uninteresting busy work for a lot of people,
00:15:17 but I, I obtain some joy from doing it. So, you know, it seemed, it strikes me as something similar.
00:15:24 You got to, you got to touch like the foundational idea behind the activity itself. You can't just
00:15:30 say, throw these numbers together in this way or throw this fucking ground up wood under these
00:15:36 trees because there's some nebulous benefit to be obtained. You have to understand the motivation
00:15:40 behind it. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Well, after you applied the mulch bin, did you pound
00:15:47 the pavement? Oh, I pounded that pavement. Oh, I was out there. Oh, I was walking the streets.
00:15:53 Okay. You may have pounded the pavement, but did you control your anger? Hardly. You mean my rage?
00:15:59 Oh, your rage. Yeah. Sorry. Did I control my rage? Occasionally.
00:16:03 Yeah. I threw a little bit. There were, there were, there were successes and failures in
00:16:09 the battering. Did you guys ever get into, okay, you guys, you, you whiteies have lived a life
00:16:14 completely alien to me in like a completely, completely free of all your post scarcity star
00:16:21 track in the future. Yeah. We've been living up in the Holy Land of Marizioa in our fucking
00:16:26 sap bubbles, breathing our pure holy air. Munchy doesn't get this reference, but these people
00:16:31 will. No, I have no idea. Yeah, I'm not white. I didn't watch the room then. Sorry. Okay. Anyway,
00:16:37 so, so you guys, how do we see that episode of Doug? Real quick. That just reminds me. Doug.
00:16:42 Sorry. That just reminds the real, I saw someone shitting on anime and being like,
00:16:45 look at all these white people. Like, why aren't we, why are we paying more attention to the black
00:16:50 characters in anime? And I'm like, these are like from Japan, dude. I don't know what's going on here.
00:16:54 Okay, anyway. That's the thing about it can't stand about anime. It's just too many white people.
00:17:00 Too many white folks in there. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. Okay, anyway, so I assume you guys
00:17:03 have lived like a, like a, like a stereotypical, like 90s household experience. I imagine you
00:17:08 guys are just melting in the middle, but there are three mountains. You ever want to say it by the bell?
00:17:11 Yeah. That was me. Okay. That was us. I literally believe that. Did you guys start getting like
00:17:17 fights with your parents? Like altercations that like you scream at them? You mean physically?
00:17:22 Not physically, but just as in like, you got really mad at them and said like, I don't know,
00:17:27 like, I'm going to my room because I fucking hate you. Rarely, but sometimes. Yeah, I did a bunch.
00:17:32 I think Ben more than the rest of us, but I'm a bit more of a mediator. So
00:17:39 I found, I found a lot of dad's mannerisms to be completely infuriating. And yeah,
00:17:46 I flew off the handle a couple of times. One time once or twice, I like kicked a hole in the wall
00:17:52 and my punishment was that I had to like do all the labor and stuff associated with repairing
00:18:00 a hole in the wall, which was quite intense and definitely taught me a lesson about not doing
00:18:05 that. That seems like the perfect punishment for some of like. It was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You ever
00:18:11 try to fucking plaster a hole in the wall? It's, it's an all day, it's an all day process. And
00:18:15 that's if you do it right the first time. Indeed, which I think you did not if I remember correctly.
00:18:21 No. Yeah. But the reason I ask is I've always had a pretty like independent
00:18:28 and like attitude for my mom, but like in a way that like not like as in like,
00:18:33 I'm not going to do what you say mom, but as in like basically since I've been like 10,
00:18:39 she hasn't really like told me to like, let me rephrase that. I don't have to fight with my mom
00:18:45 because she'll always like, she asks very little and like, you know, she's my mom. I'll just fucking
00:18:50 do it. You know, not really a big deal. I don't really mind. I've never had like a single like
00:18:55 fight. I've never screamed at my mom or like ever done anything to the effect of like, you know,
00:18:59 when I was like a real little kid, like sub 10, then I like pouted and stuff. Sure. But I've never
00:19:06 had the experience of like, I fucking hate my mom go like, you know, stomp up to my room and slam
00:19:11 the door. Well, you know, I think that that speaks to a lot. I think both your personality and your
00:19:16 mom's personality are probably an important factor in that. Like, I think Ben and I were a bit,
00:19:22 we were a bit of lay about children. We wanted just to hang out, watch TV and play video games.
00:19:27 I mean, if I, yes, please indeed, if I was growing up, I mean, I think about this. If I have like
00:19:32 lazy children, like I'm going to want to motivate them to do things and you know, get engaged and
00:19:38 I don't know, go socialize and whatnot, because it's good for them, whether they know it or not.
00:19:43 So like, you kind of got to be more on their ass. But then again, I mean, if you're just like,
00:19:48 I don't know if you can like make a person. I mean, I don't know if it'll be successful.
00:19:56 You can't really make someone do stuff that they don't want to do, at least not like consistently.
00:20:01 You know what I mean? Like, I do for them to like consist. If you want your kid to be such in such a
00:20:07 way, they're not going to, unless it's what they want. Like you can incentivize them as much as
00:20:13 you want, but you can't enforce that kind of thing forever. Well, tell me what you think about
00:20:19 this, because I've meditated on this issue about when it comes to rearing children and whatnot,
00:20:24 but it's like waterfall. Yes, indeed, indeed. Like, I don't think that a lot of the seeds that
00:20:30 specifically dad, like all the fucking lawn work and like the little tasks and I don't know,
00:20:35 like becoming Eagle Scout was very much like guided by my dad and he did a lot of the work
00:20:39 for me, basically, at least on my Eagle project at the end. And not even that, but like all the
00:20:45 tasks he had me do, all the chores and all the stuff we had to do over the years, which is,
00:20:48 again, I'm not complaining, totally fair. I feel like I was very much a lazy layabout kind of guy.
00:20:53 The chore, it was fair that we had to do stuff. I just couldn't stand his attitude. Well, the
00:20:59 attitude of like, we should want to do these things. I mean, I get that. I understand where it
00:21:05 comes from, because to him, these are things that have to be done. And like, you live here too.
00:21:10 Why don't you have the same, you know, get up and go attitude about accomplishing these tasks that I
00:21:16 do? That's disgusting. Like, it's not that I think it was wrong to ask us to do stuff. It's that he
00:21:23 was like annoyed and like angered sometimes by the fact that we didn't just want to fucking mulch
00:21:30 the trees on our own. I don't care if the trees get mulched. Well, okay, I mean, I understand your
00:21:36 point. But so that's the reason why I can I can discuss that. But like, but my point before I was
00:21:41 just making was just like, these fucking trees have dreams have nightmares or a mulching trees pound
00:21:46 in those weird pound in that pavement stakes and the weird stakes into like below the trees,
00:21:51 fertilizer stakes. You know, I've never even touched fertilizer in my life. But I can't imagine
00:21:57 you know, have you touched have you not touched poop, munchie? You know, and you have well, okay,
00:22:01 I mean, it's just like a disconnect like our dad, our dad really likes like grass, trees. Yeah,
00:22:07 you know, that's all the human core. You're in an urban jungle out there. So you would know about
00:22:11 this thing. You know, he loves all that he loves all that shit. I don't give a shit about it. Obviously,
00:22:16 our priorities there are different, you know, it's I guess it's unavoidable.
00:22:22 Nate, on one of the most recent rfck is that the last one, but the one before that I think
00:22:27 Ben describes how there were like contracts for chores in the house. And things like did the place
00:22:34 so hard. Like another another piece of the Nate jigsaw. Because you know, the point I was gonna
00:22:42 make about that was that I feel that when I was young, like until the time I was like
00:22:46 2021, up until that point, all the chores that my dad had me do enough stuff, I felt like it was
00:22:52 planting seeds. But it was when I finally moved out on my own. And like I was responsible for myself.
00:22:59 I kind of feel like all that like teaching from my dad blossomed. And it all like that's when it was
00:23:05 like, like I was prepared to like, you know, take out the trash, do the dishes, do my chores, pay my
00:23:11 taxes, be on top of my financial game, you know, make sure I was at work on time every day. And
00:23:16 like, I feel like I just kind of rapidly became an adult. And all the lessons that my dad had
00:23:22 been indirectly teaching by making me do these things and my mom too, but most of my dad,
00:23:26 like I felt like it paid off. And like I became that person, like as an adult only. And you know,
00:23:34 that that's I kind of think that's what happened to me. You know, in a weird way, I almost think the
00:23:39 opposite achieved the same result for me, where I would never like like doing the things that I
00:23:46 had to do, you know, when I did have to do chores. I did I did not have the, you know, the the immense
00:23:53 hatred that that Ben might have felt. But you know, what do you mean me? Why are you singling me out?
00:23:59 Well, neither of us liked mulching the trees. I mean, I guess you're more vociferous and you're
00:24:04 hatred, but hey, I'm just responding to you. Yeah, yeah. I think I kind of look back at all
00:24:11 these chores with a fairly rosy lens, because I like I think about them as like, helping me become
00:24:17 a more disciplined person. So even though I hated them at the time, I look back. I just remember
00:24:24 how annoyed I was by the attitude behind it all that fucking. It's like a such a boomer attitude,
00:24:30 honestly. I agree with you, Ben. But anyway, I I I always didn't want to do it. And so now that
00:24:38 I'm on my own, I don't think like it's not like as in like, I'm so unprepared for what life entails,
00:24:44 because like, it's not like, you know, this is not this is not rocket science here. You know,
00:24:48 I know it's really not that hard. It's really not. And so instead of it just being like,
00:24:52 what I think you might feel where it's like, you know, you just feel like you have experience doing
00:24:56 them and they sort of just turn into, you know, busy work that it's not really an issue. To me,
00:24:59 it's just like, well, how do I minimize suffering? Well, and then I think of ways to like, like,
00:25:07 what's the word like, I consolidate power and I make things more efficient for myself. And so for
00:25:13 instance, you know, I have like scheduled times to do things and I have specific ways I can do it
00:25:18 to maximize efficiency. And I just I just completely like locked down all the chores I have to do,
00:25:25 so that I can spend the least amount of time on them as possible. So my dislike for doing them,
00:25:32 it's not like I got mind break dosioned into liking doing dishes and stuff like that. But like,
00:25:39 I understand they have to be done. So I might as well do them for as little time as possible.
00:25:44 I mean, that's that's good as well. So I mean, are you basically saying that like your the approach
00:25:49 that like you were raised with was like, you were just given the freedom by your mom and your
00:25:53 instincts to just, you know, want to, you know, get things done so you can just be happy and,
00:25:57 you know, not worried about stuff. That's kind of what motivates you to do your shit. Yeah. Yeah.
00:26:03 Oftentimes, parenting can be like, you know, you can have like a desire and it won't have the
00:26:09 same way that you would want it to. It's sort of weird that stuff like this can be like, you can't
00:26:15 like both like, okay, your dad obviously instilled in you this sort of belief, probably intentionally
00:26:23 to give you this outcome. My mom didn't and yet I still got that sort of lesson probably not in
00:26:29 the same way or the exact specifics. It's hard to know how much of that was just you. And I mean,
00:26:34 again, it might have been nothing. It might have just been in me all along that just came out when
00:26:40 I got older or something. What do you mean by in you? You mean like, like, I mean, like, I notice
00:26:45 now that I approach like tasks and accomplishing things like very similar to how my dad did.
00:26:50 And like, we never we did talk about doing things that way. But I don't feel like that's
00:26:54 anything I learned from him. I feel like it's a kind of an innate way of approaching issues.
00:26:59 I feel I feel like a lot of the time it's it's not down to like a literal lesson, but you just you
00:27:05 just can't help but copy the adults in around you in your life. Yeah, that's why I do things.
00:27:14 Okay, I think it's probably a combination, but like you are his son. There's probably some sort
00:27:18 of like some what similar brain chemicals in there. And you know, he's your fucking dad,
00:27:22 you are random a lot. Obviously, some of that, you know, I would never say that like my dad's
00:27:27 teachings are obviously always going to be effective case in point, Ben. But you know,
00:27:33 I'm I'm much more like mom. I think so. Yeah, much more relaxed about life. You know what,
00:27:38 I'm happy with that. Well, that's good. I remember on one of the draw casts for monsters.
00:27:46 Unfortunately for you, Ben, a mom's penchant for shit. Wait, what's that thing when women
00:27:50 marry up? Mom's pension for hypergamy won't save you, Ben. You're in the rut. You got no way to go.
00:27:56 Well, I don't know. What the fuck does that mean? I mean, I was making a joke because mom isn't
00:28:00 actually hypergamous, but I don't know. Well, then marry Alexa. What a bizarre thing to say.
00:28:08 I mean, it is in fact simply inaccurate, but I thought it'd be funny. Anyway,
00:28:12 I mean, also, our dad is dead. I said the dad was dead before. Why aren't you on my ass about that
00:28:17 too, Ben? Okay, Nate, you're very consistent. I'll send you. Was that like an insult against mom or
00:28:23 something? What me? No, no, like saying, okay, you never mind. I just I just it's like such a like
00:28:30 esoteric joke to make. You know, I think so. Well, what a classic Nate's dad thing to say.
00:28:36 Oh, oh, God. Oh, and like Ben's like his mom's that that tendency would save me. I don't know,
00:28:46 but it won't save you because you're a man, not a woman. Okay. Yeah, that was that idea. Nate's
00:28:51 more like his dad. Ben's more like his mom. You guys are gonna have to pop out a baby real soon.
00:28:55 Oh, oh, Ben already had kiddie stone. He already went into labor once. We got ectobiology as hard
00:29:02 at work as we speak. Yeah, finally, you know, finally. What are we talking about? I would imagine
00:29:09 that I'm very uncomfortable. I imagine a baby between Nate and Ben would be like a lump of
00:29:14 coal or possibly some sort of like raw material that would be like use just fuel fuel and then
00:29:20 burn up. What the fuck? In what way would that be the result of our well, I mean, there's human
00:29:27 offspring. Well, okay, like it's like you didn't yank, right? If you didn't yank headed, baby,
00:29:31 probably just be some sort of like inert mass. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just some sort of like like
00:29:37 being that was not made to be sentient in any way. I mean, look at it me and Ben, I suppose,
00:29:42 as our mother and father's children, I guess they just either go one way or the other. I don't know.
00:29:48 Yeah. I feel like grace is more like you, Ben, and more like mom. But again, I don't know. Yeah.
00:29:53 Yeah. Not 100% if you had children. There would be basically your mother and father,
00:30:00 but as children. Yeah. I think we've got two moms and one dad out of this particular relationship.
00:30:07 You and me, Nate, we'll just have two babies and like one of them will have like a beard and be dad
00:30:12 and the other will be mom. It'll be like, you're gonna let a beard be dead. You know, in Lady in
00:30:18 the Tramp at the end when they have like a litter and like all the girl puppies look exactly like
00:30:23 Lady and all the boy puppies look exactly like Tramp. They're not a mix of the two.
00:30:28 No, no, no, no. Everything in its right place. Yeah, yeah. Separate but equal. That's my policy.
00:30:34 We keep the genes separate even when we interbreed. We just make sure the ones that aren't entirely
00:30:39 one or the other. We just we just dump them off a little bit. Really speaks to the myth of race
00:30:43 mixing, you know. But now I'm thinking of like your children being just tiny versions of you,
00:30:49 like a tiny Nate, like heat miser and snow miser. They're little puppets during the scene.
00:30:54 Real quick, am I remembering correctly? Did they ectobiologize at the end, like in the Homestuck
00:30:59 epilogue, just like a million combinations? Not in the epilogue. I meant the Snapchat thing. No,
00:31:05 no, no, not the epilogue. Like I remember seeing pictures of just like a million mixed up genes.
00:31:11 They use that to make the human race. Right. Based off of four template humans. Did they
00:31:15 use all eight or did they use just the four original ones? Probably all eight, right? I don't
00:31:20 know. Man, that's so fucking weird and kind of gross in a weird way. They're all like related.
00:31:26 They're all clones anyway. It's a fucking no, dude. I will say, by the way, just before we
00:31:33 transition off the being alone thing, I will say the worst thing about being alone is the fact that
00:31:38 my kitchen is still fucked. I think I talked about this on the PCP, but for like like a month, if not
00:31:45 more at this point, my action. No, yeah, more than like two months probably in what way? My
00:31:49 kitchen. Okay. Well, like, okay, there was something wrong with the dishwasher. I don't even fucking
00:31:55 know what, but we were having a perfectly fun functioning kitchen. They some repairman came
00:31:59 over to fix the dishwasher. And then there was sort of there's mold behind the dishwasher.
00:32:03 And so like smash fucking cut two weeks later, the entire kitchen ripped out cabinets,
00:32:09 dishwasher sink and fridge and like Island is gone. And there's an alien like quarantine ET
00:32:17 like like like hospital blinds around my kitchen. What does that have to do with being alone,
00:32:21 though? Wouldn't it be that way anyway? No, that's what I'm saying is that even though I'm alone,
00:32:26 I wanted I would like to like have cooked for myself. But now I like I have to like just order
00:32:33 out no matter what I would really just love during at this point to be home alone, you know,
00:32:37 I have to worry about anything. I can just go on downstairs and I have anyone, you know,
00:32:41 mess with me or try and talk to me or fuck with me and cook. But no, I'm robbed of that.
00:32:46 I've been I've been cooking. Actually, I know that cauliflower, that cauliflower pizza,
00:32:50 it sounds delicious. There was that. I made that maybe a week ago. And then I've been,
00:32:56 I went on sort of a spree, like I bought a bunch of like bulk shit from like Costco and I ordered
00:33:01 some stuff on Amazon that I couldn't find, just a bunch of like general like keto safe
00:33:06 ingredients. And I want to try the keto coffee, the bang keto coffee. No, no, no, not that,
00:33:13 unfortunately. I got I got a pound of raw cocoa butter, which is just like blocks of stuff.
00:33:19 Sick. I ordered a giant bag of like of desiccated coconut power desiccated coconut desiccated
00:33:25 unholy coconut. Imagine if you will a dark coconut. All right, here's what you have to do.
00:33:32 Here's the picture I want next week. PCP show notes. I want you sprawled out, you know,
00:33:37 on your bed. Just watch YouTube. Watch watching an Arlo video on your YouTube. You're drinking
00:33:42 bang. You're drinking bang keto coffee. Did I mention cooking Arlo's pizza recipe? Did I mention
00:33:47 that last episode? You're watching Arlo. You're kicking back a keto coffee and you're eating a
00:33:52 cauliflower banana pudding pizza. And that's your keto. It's your keto day. I'll mix it with
00:33:59 like sugar free banana like yeah, yeah, something. Okay. Yeah, I think I mentioned this last week,
00:34:06 but in case I didn't. Yeah, Arlo like was tweeting about like making low carb pizza. And I used
00:34:11 his recipe for a pizza crust and it was great. And I'm gonna do it again. The Arlo. I got I got
00:34:20 the bunch of coconut. Arlo would be great if he was a cooking show. If he had if he had like holds
00:34:26 a spoon and he goes through the little chef hat. Yeah, good. There's still time Arlo. We've got
00:34:31 notes to save you from your he's got nowhere to go but up. He's got room to expand. That's true.
00:34:37 Anyway, so this very morning. Okay, see, I realized something. I've realized that even
00:34:41 though I'm still doing keto, I haven't really been losing any more weight. I've only lost like
00:34:45 maybe three or four more pounds and maybe five pounds. Do you want to lose more? Are you are
00:34:50 you still I could I could use I could lose a little more, not too much more, but just a little
00:34:53 bit more. But I haven't lost any. So I decided that maybe I should actually start counting
00:34:57 my calories again. So I'm gonna do that. So this morning I woke up and I'm kind of hungry,
00:35:01 but I don't want to eat. I want to go back to the one meal a day thing because I was working out
00:35:04 pretty good. So instead of eating, I satisfied my lust for food by cooking food and not eating it.
00:35:12 So I made a so I made a I made fat bombs, which are basically just like fudge balls
00:35:19 that you put in the fridge. And I made a coconut flour.
00:35:24 Well, the recipe was for cupcakes, but I just cooked it into a whole cake.
00:35:29 I had to substitute heavy cream for coconut cream. That's unfortunate, but I had no choice.
00:35:33 I'll fix that. Do you plan to eat these later or this for fun? I will. I will. Yeah, I'll eat these.
00:35:38 Yeah, this is keto shit. This is keto shit, man. Now I'm set. You've heard of Kino shit time for the
00:35:44 keto shit. So so I've been, I don't know, I've been cooking more. I've been experimenting in the
00:35:50 kitchen and it's pretty it's pretty fun, I guess. It's because it's because the results are useful.
00:35:56 You see, I was very gratified, extremely gratified to buy all this shit. I spent like like more than
00:36:02 100 like 120 bucks buying these like big bags of shit. But I did it with like, this is going to
00:36:07 save me in the long run so much. If it's like if I'm buying like five pounds, I bought five
00:36:12 pounds of shredded mozzarella and I'm like, yeah, it's really expensive, but I'm going to eat it all
00:36:17 and it's going to save me in the long term because it's cheaper to buy in bulk. And I rub my hands
00:36:22 together and I was like, Oh God, I can't afford not to buy it. All the savings. I'm playing the long
00:36:27 game and it feels good. Well, that's good. We have been ordering far more groceries and eating
00:36:31 out far less than we used to. It's fairly rare. So I'm very happy about that. I don't know. We're
00:36:37 just getting groceries instead of eating out. So just a life upgrade, just a life upgrade.
00:36:42 Similar, similar. I started a, I signed up on Jewel.com to get my Jewel pods directly delivered,
00:36:51 which is actually much cheaper. Well, that's good. Significantly cheaper than buying them at the
00:36:56 fucking convenience store. And the best thing about it is that I can actually buy the good flavors.
00:37:01 So I got creme brulee. I got mango. I got cool cucumber. You know, I got everything a boy could
00:37:07 want. Well, that's great. But I'm a happy camper. I have not been cooking much. And I got to say,
00:37:13 if only I had the wisdom to get blue apron when I had the chance or whatever the fuck it was.
00:37:20 I could have been a God by now, Ben. You've divided your meat. Because I'm too dumb to look
00:37:27 blue apron. That's pussy shit. Hello, fresh is the fucking
00:37:31 blue apron is like the lift of fucking of cooking delivery.
00:37:36 I don't understand. What do you need it for? You just, okay, I'll tell you, I'll tell you exactly
00:37:41 why something in my head. And it's the same thing. You don't have to pay for it. I'm because I am not
00:37:46 a cook and I don't think about cooking. I need someone to force cooking on me on a day to day
00:37:51 basis that I will transition into a little baby. How about the fact that you don't have food?
00:37:59 It's called baby steps. What? I'm sorry, say again. I said, how I said, how about the fact that you
00:38:06 don't have food to force you to cook? Well, but we do. We've got some ingredients. We got some,
00:38:10 we got eggs, we got bread, we got exactly, exactly. So cook something with them. Yeah.
00:38:16 What do you mean? Yeah, I could do that, I guess. Yes, you could. Exactly. What about the thing
00:38:24 that you said you really liked that I could, like the eggs with the bacon and eggs combined?
00:38:31 I want that. It's so easy. You just fry bacon, you put eggs on top. I don't have that kind of
00:38:34 English bacon. I don't know where to get it. I assume the grocery store, but I don't know.
00:38:38 You just use the regular old American kind. I think it's just thick cut, isn't it?
00:38:42 Could I just, could one use normal American bacon in the same way and just cook the
00:38:46 grease into it and just keep it in there? Yeah. Okay, okay. I gotta give that a try.
00:38:51 Nate. That's keto, right? More fat, the healthier you are, as I understand it.
00:38:56 Keto gives you kidney stones, as well as energy drinks. Well, I'm down for some of those.
00:38:59 Okay, all right. Ben has gotten a kidney stone, right? Since this started?
00:39:07 But my whole thing is that everyone's like, oh, it's because of keto. Oh, it's because of energy
00:39:10 drinks. And nobody fucking knows. It could have been nothing. It's one data point that I'm taking
00:39:15 go to, but okay. It is one data point. Actually, there's a couple, but yeah. A couple contradictory
00:39:23 ones. If you're anything like me, Nate, you will go to your kitchen and think, okay, I got some
00:39:30 ingredients. I guess I could make something. I'm just going to make an egg. I'm just going to crack an
00:39:36 egg and that's it. There's no food here. It's all this worthless ingredients. What's a man to do?
00:39:42 Ingredients, ingredients everywhere and not a meal to eat. Having all of your ingredients just in
00:39:48 one place and having a specific recipe like mandated on to you means that you will want to make that
00:39:55 and it will be so often of a completely higher level than you would initially want to do. You
00:40:01 could make anything. You could make anything. Okay. I got the, I know the, here's the issue, Ben.
00:40:06 What's more fun? Tell me what's more fun, Ben, starting with a blank C plus plus file and saying,
00:40:13 I'm going to make a game and it could be anything or like firing up Minecraft and being like, let's
00:40:19 tool around here and like, you know, build a fortress. It's that disparity in my mind. I want,
00:40:27 but which one gives you the greater sense of life accomplishment? Well, I totally agree
00:40:31 that it's, but I got, I got other things to give me. As always, I work up to that. Ben, your
00:40:36 version, your version of these on such a visual level makes me so mad and I'm going to kill you.
00:40:40 I am. I really am just averse on a visceral. I really just see it as spending money on something.
00:40:44 You know, Ben, you are a cooking elitist is what you are, Ben. I'm a baby. I need baby steps.
00:40:50 I'm cooking elitist because I advocate that you should do it. That's correct, Ben. That's right.
00:40:56 Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello, fresh and stuff like this is always a stepping stone. As I've mentioned,
00:41:01 I don't get it anymore. I don't have a use for me. Well, you've evolved parts. Part of that.
00:41:05 But it's like, yeah, it's a stepping stone in, in, you pick, yeah, you get the stepping stone,
00:41:10 but meanwhile you're surrounded by like other perfectly good stones. No, you're not. It serves a
00:41:16 purpose. We've explained it to a thousand times. Google anything. Google. It has. Listen,
00:41:23 how would he know? How would he know any name of any food you can think of followed by recipe?
00:41:29 Hit enter. Done. You don't need blue apron. It's a matter of convenience. It's so convenient. Have
00:41:34 you ever heard of paying money to save time? That's what this is doing. Then you might as well just
00:41:39 fucking go out to a restaurant. You seriously might as well just do it the same shit. You can learn
00:41:44 the skill to apply later in the ways that you're advocating. It's just a stepping stone so that
00:41:49 you can learn how to cook better and then you won't have to rely on it anymore. This is such like
00:41:53 a weird, like false trichotomy. No. Okay. Yeah. You, you could cook to learn the skill, but you could
00:41:59 cook for free. So you're paying money to learn, you're paying. Listen, listen, shut up. You're
00:42:05 paying more money to learn a skill that you could learn for free. What's the fucking, like, I don't
00:42:11 get it. It's easier and I really think I really think what the money, the money that you are paying
00:42:17 is specifically so you don't have to do any thought work about what to buy, what recipes to
00:42:23 make. It's so easy though. And look, I know you might think that's dumb and like a waste of money
00:42:28 and I'm sure to many people it is, but you know, it's a convenience. That's all, that's all.
00:42:35 I see some value in that. I just, I just, you might as well listen. And you know what, maybe a
00:42:39 recipe comes up. No, no, no, here's the thing. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Okay. Listen,
00:42:42 I got, not Blue Apron, I got, I was treated to the ingredients in a, what's the Hello Fresh,
00:42:49 in a Hello Fresh package. And like, I don't know about you, Nate, Munchy, but I don't think that
00:42:58 I'm ever going to cook, I don't think that I'm ever again in my life going to have the cause to
00:43:04 cook Frisco burgers with mango chutney ever again in my life. So I don't know if I did, I don't know
00:43:10 that I did learn about you. I don't think I, it's a game. Listen, it's, it's not that it wasn't cool,
00:43:16 it tasted good, but I'm never going to make it again. But you learn about that. Okay, okay, listen.
00:43:21 I learned to do a thing I'm never going to do again. Okay, okay, hold on, wait, okay. If you,
00:43:26 if you look up the ingredient, if you look up how to make something that you actually will make in
00:43:30 the future, then you've learned something. There's so much different that the experience is actually
00:43:33 making it. But you might as well just go to a restaurant for it. That's, that's the level that
00:43:38 you're dealing with. First of all, just having the experience to make a fancy thing if you want to
00:43:42 is inherently valuable. Also, I understand there are some Hello Freshers that are above like, you
00:43:48 know, I'm not going to do this every day. But there are vast swaths of like, okay, if I simplify
00:43:52 this even just a small bit, then I could easily see doing this often. For instance, there's a,
00:43:58 there's a lot of recipes that I would love to do. How fucking hard is it to learn to cook a hamburger?
00:44:04 You got to fucking subscribe to some mail-in order service for like $40 a month to learn that
00:44:08 shit? Are you kidding me? This is literally bullying. This is not bullying. It's retardation.
00:44:14 I feel bully. Ben, this is, it's, it's, how fucking, why do you need Hello Fresh to teach you how to
00:44:19 cook a fucking hamburger? I'm literally mad. I'm literally shaking right now. Yeah, that's hard.
00:44:27 We all need to claim the victim high ground, the climb as high as possible, like less than
00:44:31 mine. I got it. No one else can have it. Ben, you're right. It's more cost effective to not do it.
00:44:38 That's why the end goal is to not do it. This, it should be like a month, maybe two months at most.
00:44:46 And it's not that, like you're over, you're over, you're over, you're over stating how expensive
00:44:52 it is. It's not like it's a fucking like a king's ransom. How much is two months of Hello Fresh?
00:44:58 I don't fucking remember. I'll check. Throw me at a number. Probably like, if I recall correctly,
00:45:03 it was like $40 a thing. $40 wasted. $40 wasted. That's all I'm saying. You, okay. I'm serious.
00:45:10 I'm serious. But you get ingredients. Yeah, you get the ingredients. It's not wasted because I ate
00:45:14 everything. Okay. And we didn't have to buy groceries. Okay. Just, okay. I'm sorry. Just mostly
00:45:17 wasted. Well, okay. All right. I could have bought that mango for like 75 cents at the grocery store.
00:45:23 They probably charged me like 250 of each one. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. I'm
00:45:27 gonna go sign up for Hello Fresh right now. I fucking can't. I can't fucking abide it. It's,
00:45:33 it's, it's unholy. It's unholy. Look, we got my Hello Fresh experience was, was completely valuable
00:45:40 and it changed my life forever. And now I cook regularly. I'm, I'm, I'm willing to drop it.
00:45:46 Let me just say one final question. What is, what is hard and what is averse to you about
00:45:54 just Googling a recipe and then buying there's nothing adversity whatsoever.
00:46:01 That's the alternative. I have the answer. You've got to see what you've got to step into what my
00:46:07 life is like. I'm sitting here in my piss and my shit. And I just don't know what the fuck I'm
00:46:13 doing here. And I need someone to spoon feed me baby recipes. I don't understand what it is. I don't,
00:46:21 I don't even know, Ben. I'm terrified. I'm terrified at the very idea of thinking about
00:46:26 what food to make. This rocks me to my core and that's where I'm coming from. Wait, Ben,
00:46:33 any old fucking thing, there's, there's more to it. There's more to it than just it having a recipe
00:46:38 for you. It is completely coddling. Hello Fresh and everything is baby-fying cooking for you
00:46:47 as baby steps. And here I sit a baby in my piss and shit. Listen, wait, no, no, wait, no, let me
00:46:52 finish. Let me finish. It babies you. It gives you recipe with extremely clear like picture book
00:46:59 X like pop up book baby shit recipe steps. It sends you all of the ingredients and like that's
00:47:06 twofold at what it says with the green so you don't have to go to the grocery store. Also,
00:47:10 it sends you the ingredients as like a ticking like clock timer, like a bomb that will go off
00:47:16 if you don't want to waste the food. Like it's here. You have to cook. You cannot avoid this.
00:47:21 You can't just have like stuff, you know, random shit in your fridge and like, oh, you know,
00:47:25 I'll cook it. Like, you know, one of these days, I'll Google how to do a recipe, you know, I'll
00:47:31 just do it sometime, you know, in the future at some point. I'm saying, I'm saying do it now.
00:47:38 I, but if you have Hello Fresh, then you're forced to do it. It's literally not like it's not an
00:47:43 option to not do it unless you just hold hostage by your own volition. And it's great. It's what
00:47:48 I want. Listen, I got this bag. I got like a four pound bag of coconut flour. And I'm like,
00:47:54 what the fuck do I do with this? So I go on the internet and I Google keto coconut flour recipes.
00:47:59 I find this recipe, I find this recipe for coconut flour cupcakes. And the ingredients are like,
00:48:08 it's like mix this shit, microwave this shit, mix it in, put it in a pan and wait an hour.
00:48:14 Okay. And that's it. I know I'm not cooking is not difficult. People are scared by cooking more
00:48:21 so than they should be. But okay, before I started Hello Fresh, I had basically not cooked
00:48:26 whatsoever in my entire life. I did not know how to cook a steak. Last time I tried to cook a steak
00:48:32 before Hello Fresh, I literally like like burnt my hand like sticking the steak into boiling oil.
00:48:39 I was that level of incompetent. I did not know how to do anything. Hello Fresh saved my marriage,
00:48:44 satisfied my wife. It fucked her for me. I didn't have to do anything. It was super convenient.
00:48:50 It was just what I needed. I got to apologize. I realized that I'm arguing from a position
00:48:56 of privilege. And I, you know, I'm privileged to be competent at things and I can't sometimes I
00:49:03 have trouble empathizing with those that aren't. I appreciate you acknowledging that. So I'm gonna
00:49:09 check my privilege right at the door. Enjoy some nice keto fat bombs later on in the day
00:49:15 and just feel sorry for the lot of you. That's my plan. That's my new plan for this Easter Sunday.
00:49:22 It's not for everyone. I wouldn't even, I don't even know if I would say that like,
00:49:26 I recommend it as like a blanket thing. All I'm saying is if you're intimidated by cooking
00:49:31 and you are able to pay for it comfortably, because it's not that much, then you can do it for like
00:49:37 a couple weeks, think, okay, this isn't that bad. And then stop. It's not like I'm advocating to do
00:49:43 it forever or even for a long time. You can do it if you think any of this sounds valuable to you.
00:49:50 You could eat, you could do it online. It's not, not valuable. I'm just saying it's reasonable.
00:49:57 And I'm just saying you could do that or you could do literally the same thing for free. Okay.
00:50:03 It's not, why do you think it's the same thing? That's all I'm saying. Let's, let's move on. We
00:50:08 have to move on. Listen, that's all I'm saying. We've got to move on. That's all I'm saying. Okay,
00:50:13 here we are ready for this talking prompt. Okay, here it is. Okay. Two diametrically
00:50:18 opposed quotes. Okay, here we go. Reggie fees him a from Nintendo quote, the game is fun.
00:50:25 The game is a battle. If it's not fun, why bother? Okay, that's Reggie. Other man, Neil
00:50:31 drunk, asked for context, or are you deliberately leaving out content? Well, it was, I don't know,
00:50:36 who's talking about his conceit of making video games. That was the idea. Oh, the making of the
00:50:41 game is a battle or rather like, why? I think he was talking about Nintendo games in general. And
00:50:46 he's just like, you know, if the game's not fun, why bother? Was the, was the, see, okay. All right.
00:50:51 Now, juxtapose that with Neil Druckman of Naughty Dog. I don't know if he's CEO or whatever. Here's
00:50:56 the, here's the quote. It's, we don't use the word fun. That's the full quote. And specifically,
00:51:02 that was in reference to the development of last of us two. They don't use the word fun. First of
00:51:07 all, who the fuck would say that when you're developing a video game? That's just the most
00:51:11 pretentious shit what the problem is there at all. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I think it's weird that
00:51:16 Naughty Dog would say that, but I don't think last of us and stuff. I mean, last of us is a
00:51:22 shooter. That's fun. It's just, I don't know. The word cucked really comes to mind when I think
00:51:28 about this. What do you, what are you talking about? Imagine making video games and not having
00:51:33 your primary goal being it being fun. That is so hard. You fucking fool. Survival horror games.
00:51:41 They're not fun. They're stressful. Sion Hill 2 is super fun. And well,
00:51:46 well, dot, dot, dot. I mean, it is fun. Horror games are not meant to, I can't even,
00:51:54 I fully agree. I fully expect you to be like, well, obviously you're right, Ben, but what I
00:52:00 meant was dot, dot, dot. Like games don't have to be fun. Games are an art form. Games can evoke
00:52:05 any, any emotion you want. They can have any message. We don't have the expectation that movies be like
00:52:11 fun. They can experience the full range of human emotion and we'll still have enjoyed
00:52:14 experience. Okay. All right. You know what? You know what? I realize all of a sudden this is
00:52:17 dumb because everything here hinges on the definition of the word fun. And it wasn't an enjoyable
00:52:23 experience. Like you like, I found Silent Hill 2, for example, a notable, very much liked horror
00:52:29 game, a very enjoyable experience. Like, I don't know. Like does, does unraveling the, the narrative
00:52:36 pathos of the tragedy of, I forget the name of the character, James is like psyche and all the
00:52:42 horrors. Like is that fun? I mean, I found it very enjoyable to play through. So I could call that
00:52:48 fun. You know, I guess I'm sure people would say the same about like Last of Us and Last of Us 2
00:52:53 when it comes out. Maybe Naughty Dog is taking a page out of Garfield Itz's book and they don't
00:52:58 talk about fun. They talk about entergagement. Do you guys know about Garfield Itz? Oh, of course.
00:53:03 Of course. I'm not sure. I'm not sure if I'm following. Did I talk about, okay, well, there is an app
00:53:07 and I think it is currently only available in Saudi Arabia. But it is, well, no, no, I think, I think
00:53:13 it was in one of the countries below Saudi Arabia that I could be wrong. We continue. All countries
00:53:17 are below Saudi Arabia, but go on. But it is Garfield Itz and Garfield Itz is an app that lets
00:53:23 you order a Garfield shaped pizza, comma, a lasagna, comma, or a Garfield themed coffee.
00:53:31 And then while you wait, you can play Garfield themed mobile games and read Garfield comic
00:53:36 strips and watch the old Garfield cartoon show. And there is fucking videos of Jim Davis, the man
00:53:42 himself on the website talking about the core concept behind Garfield Itz, which is a concept
00:53:50 called entergagement, a combination of entertainment and engagement. That's fascinating. Garfield Itz
00:53:56 is entergaging fact. I mean, that's that's kind of an interesting idea to like keep people on
00:54:05 this app that's or for ordering food and then it also has games embedded in it.
00:54:09 Interesting. Yes. Good. Capitalist nightmare. Absolutely.
00:54:14 If you'd please direct yourself to the Garfield Itz website, which will you'll start scrolling
00:54:22 and you'll start thinking, haha, this is really funny. And then the God awful music will start
00:54:28 playing and you'll just like scramble to the volume mixer and fucking have a herney in the meantime.
00:54:35 Garfield Itz's catchphrase slogan is love me, feed me, don't leave me. It's the neat. It's the
00:54:41 neediest app of all time made by a disgusting man who photoshopped his own mouth to be tiny and dull
00:54:49 like because maybe that's cool. It's Saudi Arabia or something. I don't fucking get it.
00:54:54 The head manager is this is a guy who like just like he talks about how much he loves Garfield
00:55:00 and he has a small mouth because he purposely tries to Photoshop his mouth and all the in all
00:55:05 the Instagram if you go if you go to like his uh personal Instagram all the pictures of his face
00:55:12 his lips are like shrunk to make him look more attractive question mark. Huh. Yeah. Okay. Well,
00:55:19 that's cool. It's what it's allies with this man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, the guy had
00:55:26 like the idea for the app and then he went to Jim, I think. Okay. And Jim was like entertainment.
00:55:36 Like, is entertainment not in and of itself? If you are entertained, are you not also engaged?
00:55:42 I mean, you'd think so. But I mean, maybe I would keep you that way. Like, I would think so.
00:55:48 Like, I mean, this app almost holds you hostage. It's like the it's like the message. It's like the
00:55:55 rallying cry for to use this app is like, come be ensnared in our corporate web, like have your
00:56:03 focus have your focus diverted to our IP. Well, you know, man, that's interesting because I that's
00:56:07 kind of how I think about like MMOs in general, which is why I've never really gotten into one.
00:56:13 So people, you know, depending on the quality of it, people are willing to sign up for that
00:56:17 shit. Well, yeah, yeah, but they don't say it like that. Well, yeah, I mean, yeah. Okay, fair enough.
00:56:22 They don't talk about like, like the hot this hot new MMO is going to enter gauge the shit out of you.
00:56:28 Well, you know, I might be tempted. They might say, you know, I'm going to be immersed and,
00:56:34 you know, I'm going to get my Pete Garfield shape lasagna delivered to me or immersed. I don't know.
00:56:38 You know, it's the talk about like immersion, talking about like, you know, adventure or
00:56:43 whatever, like those words are like, they're trying to sell like how fun, how much fun you'll
00:56:47 have, how cool it'll be, a word like enter gaugement, which is like, prominently featured on the
00:56:52 Garfield eats advertisement. Yeah, no, it's like, it's like naked business naked business talk,
00:56:57 like right out front. Guys, can you can you even like it's palpable. It's inside base. It's inside
00:57:03 baseball brought outside into the day. The markup they can charge on a pizza that they fuck up the
00:57:10 dough on and make slightly like like implied Garfield ears by just like not creating the dough
00:57:17 correctly and like, like making a little bit misshapen. The markup is like $4. It's I'll pay,
00:57:24 I'll pay, I'll pay extra to be enter gauge. I'll pay extra to have my pizza suck shit, please.
00:57:31 Yes. I mean, I think about like, what makes me like, please misshape my pizza. I'll give you
00:57:36 anything. I'll fucking order it from any app. I'll pay any amount. Please make my pizza not a
00:57:43 circle. It's like think about Garfield for one extra second of my life while I cut off his fucking
00:57:48 ears to devour. I should mention that's like the delivery of the like, like the Garfield eats
00:57:54 delivery service, like they all get delivered on like eco friendly green like scooters. Oh, yeah,
00:57:59 like they have like a fleet of Garfield eats scooters that is like going around fucking
00:58:03 Dubai or whatever. You know, when I was in Japan, pizza was kind of a luxury item there. And like,
00:58:09 I don't everything's really condensed. So like there's this tiny little pizza shops,
00:58:12 but you see outside of them, like in Tokyo, you'll see like a fleet of little buggies
00:58:16 that are like that's how they deliver pizzas in Tokyo. I mean, that's just that's just that just
00:58:22 seems efficient. Also, the pizzas are tiny, but that's that's Japan. They're like that in Italy,
00:58:27 too. Italy, pizzas are like a like a personal thing. They're not for it. But it's Italy. What
00:58:32 are they doing? They every pizza should be twice the size through the through the sheer. What's
00:58:35 that like the the geographic boost, like the stat boost to be a whole team, a whole team
00:58:40 advantage like stab stab stab type, you know, advantage. They just don't see differently.
00:58:46 It's it's a change in perspective. I guess it's not it's not communal engagement. Italians hate
00:58:52 the family. They're trying to actively destroy it. Yeah, you know what they say about Italy,
00:58:56 when you're here, you're not family. Hey, but on this game subject, though, like, okay, I'm thinking
00:59:03 about a game that I love right now, Sekiro. And I'm like, why do I play Sekiro? What am I getting
00:59:07 out of it? Specifically with Sekiro, it's like two main things. One is like the sheer joy of
00:59:13 exploring the environment, because it's totally sick. And the other thing is like, like, obtaining
00:59:18 mechanical competence and overcoming obstacles, especially in flashy and impressive ways. So,
00:59:25 so, you know, that that's pretty sick. But like with an MMO, like, I guess you definitely get
00:59:30 both of those things as well. But there's also like, I don't know, when people talk about like
00:59:34 VR and like wanting to immerse themselves, I get like almost scared of the idea of getting immersed
00:59:40 in like a VR world. I want a clear, defined line between me and the virtual world. Have you well,
00:59:46 have you have you used a Oculus Rift or something? Have you used a VR headset? Only like once at
00:59:51 Bronycon for like, oh, yeah, yeah, that that was rainbow dash flying around or something. That was
00:59:57 my first time using one, too. Well, you know, I have I have an Oculus Rift. Yeah. And, you know,
01:00:03 it's not it's it's not like you don't know there's a screen. Well, sure. Sure. So I don't know. Well,
01:00:11 I'm more questioning the the motivation doesn't concern me. What do you mean? Well, like, like,
01:00:16 I mean, with this with this quote here from our boy, Druckman, you know, like, we don't use the
01:00:21 word, but like, yeah, it's interesting to think about which game he's talking about. Well, he's
01:00:26 not talking about like, you know, some like you could imagine VR or whatever being used for like
01:00:31 just to create like an environment you can like explore and walk around or something like it's
01:00:36 just cool in some way. Like that may or may not be defined as fun. But he's talking about Last of
01:00:40 Us 2 specifically. And like, I don't know, like that game I would imagine is fun. And like, isn't
01:00:46 it fun to like get a sick headshot when you're down your last minute and you know, you got to make
01:00:53 the primary goal. So they thus they don't talk about the word fun.
01:00:59 I mean, I guess that's not their primary ethos when developing the game.
01:01:02 You know, honestly, I think probably their their ethos of it was probably like, you know, immersion,
01:01:08 engagement. Yeah, maybe. Intergagement in a way. Intergagement, you know, building tension.
01:01:16 Which, you know, might have the side effect of fun. Well, at what point does it become like a
01:01:20 primary focus? And what point is it just a side effect? I mean, they're making the game. They
01:01:25 know what it's going to evoke in people. They do testing and whatnot. Do they though? I mean,
01:01:30 I mean, they made Last of Us 1. Death of the Author, baby. You know, it kind of doesn't matter
01:01:35 what their ethos is. If like the end product comes out as something people want to experience.
01:01:40 I mean, whatever they call that fun or not. You know, honestly, this is a semantic argument. I
01:01:45 could, you know, I could rail and whine and bitch and virgin rage about his usage of the word fun
01:01:50 in this particular way. But ultimately, I mean, I would argue that I think you're trying to make
01:01:55 the game a little bit fun, dude. So that seems a little strange to me. But you know what? Who gives
01:01:59 a fuck? Oh, it's part of the problem. Okay, it's part of the problem to you that it's like,
01:02:03 like, you're trying to make the game fun. Like, like, are you like, like, obviously, that must
01:02:08 be something that means to be sub numbered in your calculation. So are you trying to say that you're
01:02:13 not making it fun to appease other people? Is that what you're suspecting that he's trying to be like
01:02:16 hoity toity and not like like be like games are an art and we're not about fun here. We're about
01:02:23 telling a story. Yeah, is that where the end comes from? Yeah, my my my gaydar flares when I hear,
01:02:29 you know, things of that nature. So yeah, so yeah, I have multiple gaydar various strikes. I mean,
01:02:35 you know, it is for a company like Naughty Dog to say that I mean, they made like Jack and Daxter,
01:02:41 right? But times have changed, you know, I guess times have changed. But still,
01:02:46 yeah, still that that's not the company I would think of to say something. I would mean, I would
01:02:50 think of like, you know, maybe someone like Jonathan Blow might say something like that.
01:02:55 Yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, what are the guy who made papers, please? When I played,
01:03:00 what are those Nathan Drake? What are those games, you know, explore uncharted when I played the
01:03:05 uncharted to only and like the whole time, those are definitely meant to be fun. Oh,
01:03:11 yeah, that's true. But like, when I was playing that, I felt like this is this is kind of weird,
01:03:15 like this game is a little bit too close to like a Hollywood movie that's not that great. And like
01:03:21 also like the controls like aren't super fun. So like, I feel like the the goal of that game was
01:03:27 just totally not what someone like me, like sure, it looked beautiful. And like, I don't know, I'd
01:03:32 rather just like watch a movie than play that particular game. I have never I have, I have
01:03:37 never played an uncharted. Yeah, I listen to like reviews of the whole, God, was it was it super
01:03:43 bunny hop or someone? Yeah, someone did like a big like a big like series of reviews about the
01:03:49 whole series. My impression is that playing one of those is basically just like a a like watching
01:03:56 an Indiana Jones movie, but like, you're hitting the buttons to make it happen. Yeah, yeah. And
01:04:01 which is very weird. And yeah, it does kind of seem like the antithesis of what I want in a game,
01:04:06 because I'm all I'm all about fucking, you know, action and like I'm all about like
01:04:11 platforming and like twitchy reflexes and enter the gungeon and down well and stuff that that's
01:04:16 my jam. I'm I like my I like my games, gamey. Same please. But I but I mean, I just suppose
01:04:24 that the sort of I don't think I don't think it's invalid, like I don't think that game. It's not
01:04:27 invalid, but I guess it makes me feel that like the the category of what makes for like triple
01:04:33 a great top of the line game like that. That's really widened. And maybe games like Final Fantasy
01:04:39 Seven are like responsible for you know, I mean, it was it was a big one along those lines. Although
01:04:44 the game that game was gamey as fuck. But it'd be it'd be foolish to not address the FMB creep.
01:04:50 Which game? Final Fantasy Seven, Final Fantasy Seven. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was a big
01:04:54 was a big boost and all that shit. And look where it's landed screenix now in the shitter,
01:05:00 I would say in many ways, in many ways. I don't know games are complicated. It's weird.
01:05:09 Video game consoles are weird. Like I have to like consoles are weird and I don't like like
01:05:14 they're a computer. But PS5 was just announced. Yeah, they're a very limited streamlined computer.
01:05:20 PS5 was just an I think like documents are released. Who fucking cares at the PlayStation
01:05:25 PlayStation sucks, dude. It's all about the GameCube. PS4 is doing I think it's leading. I think
01:05:31 it's like winning the console war currently. The console war is like you like okay, you pop out
01:05:37 two you'd pop out three babies, you put them in a pig pen and you was like come back three years
01:05:41 later like oh, who won? Oh, I guess this baby won but he's still corpse. You know, it doesn't
01:05:45 matter. They're all dumb and I hate them. Consoles are like 600 bucks now, right? Well,
01:05:51 600, but they're expensive. Yeah, like consoles being as expensive as they are,
01:05:56 I kind of don't understand why we aren't just why we aren't just playing on PC. Yeah, I think
01:06:01 I think things are moving more and more that way. But I don't know. There's a lot of console
01:06:04 loyalists out there. Something like the switch like the switch brings something to the table.
01:06:09 And I know I don't have a switch, but I know everybody loves this. I have a switch and it
01:06:14 almost turned me away because it was extremely is way more expensive than I wanted to pay for
01:06:18 something. Yeah, because for the amount that I that I knew I would use it and continue to use it
01:06:23 now. But ultimately, I think it was worth it. But like a play station where it's like the reason
01:06:27 like the switch is because I can play it, you know, outside the house or anywhere like tucked away
01:06:32 and warm and cuddly. Exactly. I'm all about getting up and like turn on my TV to play a video game.
01:06:38 No one's got time for that shit. And that would be the most uncomfortable experience of my life.
01:06:42 I would hate doing that. I would never want to pay $400 to like turn on my TV. That's a nightmare
01:06:50 I can't abide by. I've just got a super powerful, you know, video game machine,
01:06:54 aka my computer that I just played Sekiro on brand new game. It runs like a dream and is fantastic.
01:07:01 And my computer is great. So it's not a problem. But sitting above it, I've got my ps4, my ps3,
01:07:06 my switches to the left. I mean, I got them because like, I don't know, had to play Bloodborne.
01:07:10 So had to buy a ps4. But for how long? For how long is the question? I'm surprised we're still
01:07:17 doing the console model. Honestly, it's weird. Yeah, I don't get it. I don't get why we have an
01:07:22 all transition. I mean, the weird thing that's happening now is like, have you heard about
01:07:26 like the Epic Store is rising as a real arrival to steam? I have heard of it. And I don't know
01:07:32 what it is. It's basically, you can just think of it like steam only, like they are much stauncher
01:07:38 gatekeepers of what content gets onto their shit. Because they kind of they make more of a pomp and
01:07:43 circumstance about which games get on there. They're like, wait, what are they? Are they selling
01:07:48 PC games? Like, are they basically just steam? Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. Okay. Okay,
01:07:53 Nate, why do people hate steam? I mean, I can tell you why I personally hate steam. And it's
01:08:00 because it is so I don't know how to use it. And it's so fucking hard every time. It's like weird
01:08:06 to like find games. And I don't know, maybe I'm not a PC genius. If I don't understand, if you know
01:08:13 what you're looking for, it's not hard to find a game. You know, that's probably true. I have been
01:08:17 plagued by confusion and issues with using steam for years. Maybe I know, I know, I know, I know
01:08:24 that I know that steam has a lot of like shit on it. But like, you don't have to buy. Yeah, you
01:08:29 don't have to wait. Okay, hold on. Okay, Nate, that's so contrary to my steam experience. Here's
01:08:34 I just did this to test to make sure I click on the steam app. It opens up. And I and I it's
01:08:42 literally one click away from being in a game not as into type over the games list. I mean,
01:08:47 you just have a list of all the games I own immediately upon pressing start. I might just
01:08:52 be an idiot. All right, let's do a challenge. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Yeah, I don't I actually I
01:08:57 don't get what you don't understand about using steam. I do it does annoy me that all my steam
01:09:01 games have to open steam and like games won't run if I'm not online because that's annoying for
01:09:06 sure. Yeah, that is horrible. And I hate it. But like, what do you mean? That's stupid. Okay, it
01:09:13 shouldn't be the case mandatory, but it doesn't bother me at all. I mean, it does bother me. Okay,
01:09:18 but I've just learned to live with it at this point. I mean, I guess that's okay. Let's do a test.
01:09:22 Name a game on steam. What's a game on steam? I probably don't have to. Oh, are you talking about
01:09:26 buying games? Hattiful boy. Oh, okay, wait, okay. I'm gonna go try to buy this right now. I'm not
01:09:34 going to. I'm gonna see if I can do it. All right. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, you know what?
01:09:37 Nate, stop, stop. Of course you don't do that yet. The search bar issues with like the library.
01:09:43 Look, I know I had like my parental thing was like locked on for some reason. I couldn't get to my
01:09:49 Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, okay. Okay, I'm gonna close steam. You close steam too.
01:09:54 I'm gonna time us and we're gonna see how long it takes me. This is so this is so fucking dumb.
01:09:59 You just you just type the name and you find what's the problem? We're gonna see. We're gonna see.
01:10:03 We're gonna see right now. What's the name of the game again, Ben? Hattiful boyfriend. Okay.
01:10:08 Hattiful boyfriend. All right. All right. Start the timer now. I'm starting up steam right now.
01:10:13 Here I go. Yep. It was closed. It's updating. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Updating for available updates.
01:10:18 All right. Gonna do this for 45 minutes. That's fine. All right. So we'll just we'll wait. We'll
01:10:23 see what's passed. No, I can still wait. 14 seconds in. 15 seconds in. I got it.
01:10:28 I'm searching the store. Okay. I'm there. It's still updating for me. Hattiful. I see it right
01:10:33 there. Okay. I'm at the page. I see there's a there's a bird. That's the bird. Okay. And I'm
01:10:37 still updating on add to cart. And where do I purchase for myself? I'm clicking on it.
01:10:44 And okay, I'm at the place where I can now buy it. Okay. So that's it. That was that was 30 seconds.
01:10:49 So what was the problem? Okay. The problem may have been some reason I have had like my parental
01:10:58 like limit on on steam for like years. And I don't know why and I did fix this the other day.
01:11:05 But it's just given me a real sour taste in my mind. I can only imagine. But you know what?
01:11:11 You're free now. I guess I'm free now. I suppose that's true. But I just feel I don't I don't
01:11:16 trust this. Like the birds and hatch a full boyfriend. This feels like a false sense of
01:11:20 security. This this bird's cold gaze looking at me. I feel like at any moment, it's real. It'll
01:11:25 betray me. He means every word. I feel like I've been here before. But I guess we'll see. I guess
01:11:31 we'll see. You felt this way before. So. Okay. Well, the point is steam. You know, a lot of
01:11:38 I don't I don't understand this. I know that a lot of like, particularly,
01:11:41 uh, well, I guess I'll just say, you know, like left wing ish, like free anti free speech kind
01:11:47 of people are like one, they don't like the Twitter allows a lot of hateful rhetoric on Twitter.
01:11:53 And then similarly, I think that same crowd also doesn't like that steam lets like unsavory content
01:11:59 on it. Like that's what like, like, like school shooter simulator and, you know, stuff like that
01:12:05 or, you know, like all the sex dojin stuff. Yeah, I from what I understand, those people
01:12:13 don't love that steam lets a lot of, you know, that kind of things on air. I don't care. Let
01:12:17 everything on. I don't give a shit. Okay. I know some people make an argument that like the crap
01:12:21 covers up the good stuff, whatever, don't care. Anyway, so Epic store exists. And some people
01:12:26 are making the jump because steam was the only party in town for a while. Wait, hold on. I want
01:12:30 to touch on that. Sure. For the crap to cover up the good stuff, you'd have to be on steam,
01:12:34 like, which I guess that's how some people use it. Actually, you know what, I have done that
01:12:38 because there were like, like, at some point, I would occasionally just jump on steam and look
01:12:43 at what's on sale. Yeah, that's the issue. I guess they're talking about just scroll through the
01:12:47 really cheap stuff. And yeah, there is a lot of like, really bad, like completely amateur hack
01:12:52 shit that I don't know why it's on there doesn't bother me at all. Actually, that's how I found
01:12:55 that's how I found Lisa the painful. Oh, there you go. I was just going through like cheap
01:13:00 shit on sale on steam. I mean, and I found and I found Lisa on sale for like $2.99,
01:13:04 and I thought the trailer was cool. And it was fucking great. Yeah.
01:13:08 Like does not impact me whatsoever, even one bit. It just means there's more options on the
01:13:14 platform. It does not obstruct any of the views. If you know, possibly like all it takes is like
01:13:20 like we just did with our wonderful exercise just now, if you know the game you're looking for,
01:13:24 it couldn't be easier to find you simply search for the game. And it's either there or it's not
01:13:29 if it's like not on steam or whatever. So yeah, so I mean, there's nothing to cut through there.
01:13:34 It's cool that people who don't like it have an option now, but I just never understood why people
01:13:39 don't like it. Hi, Tom Oliver here, world renowned video game creator and editor of this
01:13:48 Procrastinator's podcast. And there's really only so long I can sit here listening to these
01:13:54 fucking idiots talking about video games out of their asses. So I'm here to set the fucking record
01:14:01 straight and save this episode from heaps of criticism in the comments. First of all, the
01:14:07 console market exists primarily for two reasons in this day and age. One is cost and two is barrier
01:14:13 of entry. Even if consoles cost $600 now Ben, which they don't their 300 bucks across the board
01:14:20 are probably going to drop in price within the next year or so as the next generation of consoles
01:14:23 are announced. The reason that this market exists and this cost is important is because PCs to play
01:14:30 games at the same level of consoles are more expensive to build a PC right now in the mid range
01:14:36 that can adequately play games is about $500 to $600 for decent components. And that's not
01:14:43 including a Windows license, a display and then decent peripherals like a mouse, a keyboard,
01:14:49 and a gamepad. Put that all together, you're in the $800 plus range to get set up on PC,
01:14:55 as opposed to a $300 box that plugs into your TV you already have. So it's much cheaper for the
01:15:01 average person to just buy a PlayStation and not think about it for five to 10 years, as opposed
01:15:07 to building a PC and then having to upgrade the components constantly every couple years to be
01:15:12 able to play at decent settings. The second reason for consoles kind of builds off of that.
01:15:18 No pun intended. Building. To get a PC at a respectable price, you have to build it because
01:15:23 you're going to pay extra to have another vendor build it for you, whether it's a big company like
01:15:28 HP or Dell or a smaller vendor like CyberPower or iBuyPower or what have you. So if you want to
01:15:33 build a PC that takes much more skill than just again going to Best Buy, paying a single price,
01:15:40 getting a console, putting it on your desk and forgetting about it for the next 10 years. So
01:15:44 for these two reasons, consoles are around to stay because they're easier to get into and for
01:15:49 most people they cost less. Now for the Epic Games Store, this is really less of a problem with
01:15:55 consumers and more of developers versus consumers because consumers like Steam. Steam's been around
01:16:02 for like 10 fucking years now. Everybody has a huge library on Steam. The platform from a consumer
01:16:08 standpoint is very mature. It has all the features you'd want, wish list, shopping carts, user reviews,
01:16:15 a big community feature. Steam is established and people like Steam and users. However, because
01:16:22 they allow everything on the platform for the most part with very little curation, new developers
01:16:28 coming in who want to kind of like have their shit be noticed is very difficult because
01:16:34 dozens and dozens of games release on Steam every day. So unless you've built up a huge
01:16:40 presence on social media outside of Steam, you're not going to have a lot of people finding your
01:16:45 game. The onus really falls upon the developer to build up hype for themselves. The value of
01:16:51 publishing on Steam is not as big as it once was because everybody can just fucking do it.
01:16:57 You know, before in the beginning, if you were on Steam, you were on the big platform that not
01:17:03 everybody could get into. And so the clout of just being on Steam was a reason to be there in and of
01:17:08 itself. Nowadays, since everybody and can just asset flip on Steam, it doesn't mean shit, which
01:17:14 means you the developer have to work harder to get noticed outside of that platform to build an
01:17:19 audience before you even launch. So you're going to have any success on Steam anyways, because the
01:17:23 majority of your games sales happened within the first three days of release. So if you're releasing
01:17:29 with 50 60 100 other games at the same time, and you haven't built any presence outside of Steam's
01:17:35 launch, you're fucked. This is why Epic Games is targeting developers making all these deals to
01:17:40 bring in big high end games to be exclusive on this epic game store for six months to a year,
01:17:46 because that's going to bring in consumers, people who end up buying games. And it's also
01:17:50 attractive for smaller developers, maybe not one man studios, but smaller dev teams to go
01:17:55 onto the store that has less noise and a better chance of their game being seen by the public.
01:18:01 Now, Epic and steam aren't the only names in the game. You also have origin, you have you play,
01:18:05 and you have Gog. Gog is really good because they don't have any DRM or anything. But another
01:18:09 interesting player for small indie guys is Discord. Discord is trying to build their own
01:18:14 publishing service. And they're integrating it with Discord communities, which lots of small
01:18:18 development teams already have. So there's tons of players in this game right now. And it's going
01:18:22 to be really interesting to see over the next couple years how everything pans out. Epic does seem
01:18:27 set up to be the big new player that's going to be able to actually give steam a run for its money
01:18:32 and might actually end up being the de facto players because 10 cent who own so much of Epic
01:18:37 has so much cash to throw around, they can keep just getting all these exclusives. So the next
01:18:43 like 12 to 24 months is really going to be interesting because Epic has the exclusives,
01:18:48 but has none of the features that people from a consumer standpoint really enjoy about steam.
01:18:53 But at the end of the day, people are impatient and want to play their games. And when Borderlands
01:18:57 3 drops, you bet your ass is going to be a huge spike in Epic Games installs that day.
01:19:01 That's all I have to say. Get back to the podcast, patreon.com,
01:19:05 such as Polystation 2. If you want more commentary about games, that's actually informed.
01:19:09 Well now, now the world that we're arriving in is a world where like instead of having a bunch
01:19:14 of consoles, what we might find in the years to come is a series of icons of different online
01:19:21 game stores on your desktop. That's less bad. I mean, it's just probably annoying that I have
01:19:27 to deal with that. It is the biggest issue. You just kind of know which platform it is. I mean,
01:19:31 as long as it doesn't cost me anymore, I don't care. Like for my own convenience, I would sure
01:19:38 like if everything was in one place. But again, if I consider myself a relatively educated consumer
01:19:44 here, I will know what games I want to play and I will go find them. But you know, I find myself
01:19:50 at times, like your lease experience there, there's times when you're just looking for a game and
01:19:54 you know, you'd want the quality curated so as you don't waste your time. And at those times,
01:20:00 I have been frustrated by the like swaths of totally amateur like crappy visual novel shits for
01:20:07 99 cents. But like it's weird to think that like deals. It's weird to think that the solution to
01:20:13 this problem is ban more things from Steam or you know, don't let them hold on. Hold on. It's not
01:20:19 we're not talking about banning. It's a question of curation. I mean, of like quality of like,
01:20:24 like they're a company. And like to you might argue that like their, you know, values or their,
01:20:31 you know, their quality standards are reflected in the products that they're willing to, you know,
01:20:36 host on through their platform. I mean, sure, sure. That's true. But like, let's just accept
01:20:41 the reality that there are games who that are there on Steam now that as this progresses may
01:20:46 not be there anymore. And I mean, I would argue that's a bad thing. I'd want them to be available.
01:20:50 I don't know if they'll get promoted. Nate, I mean, they're not, they're a publisher. They're
01:20:57 not obligated to publish everything. Like every publisher has to choose like, what do we want?
01:21:02 Like what's good enough? What do we want our brand to be associated with? Well, I mean,
01:21:06 that's choose what to publish and whatnot. That's certainly true. I just simply want the
01:21:11 availability of every game somewhere. And I mean, again, like for me, it's just the most
01:21:16 convenient thing. Well, yeah, but not through, I mean, you're arguing that a privately owned
01:21:23 company should be obligated to publish everything? Well, first of all, I never said that. I did not
01:21:30 take that position. That's what you just said. I mean, no, that's not true. Maybe you're trying
01:21:35 to follow my logic through to what you think is the conclusion. I mean, look, they're a private
01:21:39 company. I can't force them to do anything. That's the end of the story. But you didn't
01:21:43 talk about what you wanted me to do. You want them to publish everything. Here's what I want.
01:21:47 I want someone I don't care who to make every game available in one place for my personal
01:21:53 convenience. That's what I want. But I'm aware that that will not happen. So there's no even
01:21:58 point telling me it's dumb. I get it. That's the end. That's the end. Every every game includes
01:22:06 some shit that some kids shout out in their fucking beginner programming. Yeah, so just have
01:22:11 those be, you know, on the platform. So I have to search them out if I want to get them. But you
01:22:15 know, why do you why do those have to be on a platform? Those things can be like those things
01:22:19 can be available for my convenience is why that's why for my simplicity. That's the only reason.
01:22:26 Well, but as long as the game plays, that's all I get like whatever. It's just a portal.
01:22:32 That sort of flies in the face of like what it is to be a publisher.
01:22:37 But okay, well, why is it that I mean steam themselves took the look there. I know that
01:22:41 that's changing recently seems to be mostly due to market out like, you know, consumer outcry or
01:22:45 whatever. But like remember when steam took the position that like, we're just going to allow
01:22:50 everything that doesn't like break the law or whatever. Like they already did this. I'm just
01:22:54 saying that I liked that. I thought that was good. So you know, I know that I really like I
01:23:00 don't understand. Okay, I love I like the fact I literally enjoy the fact that like, you know,
01:23:05 not polished games can get on to steam. Because I like the fact that there can be like, you know,
01:23:12 it's like a big old, it's a big old marketplace that term implies a lot. But I don't really mean
01:23:17 like that. But it's like, you know, it's a big old space, where even even maybe some of the
01:23:21 unpolished, maybe some of the amateur stuff can rise to the top. If you know, if it's if it's good
01:23:27 enough, people reviewed enough, I think that's cool that you can be independent and it can and
01:23:31 it becomes successful. I don't want quality crowded out, obviously. But I mean, that strikes me as
01:23:35 just like, you know, like, I would put the curation in the like, what's promoted, like what, you know,
01:23:41 maybe like user votes or something or staff picks or, you know, I would use things like that to
01:23:46 put things to the top. That's, you know, that's that's what I'd like. But then if I want to play
01:23:50 some bullshit, then I just type in the name and no, it's weird. Yeah, it's we I don't really
01:23:55 understand steam because like it's not they don't just allow everything. And yet some of the some
01:24:02 of the cruft that is on there seems like it could only be there if they just allowed everything.
01:24:07 Are you talking about low quality games or like, you know, like questionable content sort of?
01:24:12 No, I'm talking about low quality shit. I'm talking about shit that just seems like incompetent.
01:24:17 I think steam will allow anything that fucking runs and like passes their generic like, you know,
01:24:22 green light test. Well, I think they've changed their process a lot. Like, I mean, I think getting
01:24:28 on to steam used to be a bigger deal. And maybe maybe it is that now, I think now it's like,
01:24:34 to get on steam, you have to you have to pay like maybe $100 like application fee or something.
01:24:39 And then and then I think it might be a community thing, like you need a certain number of votes
01:24:44 on green light or something. So now maybe it is that literally anything can get on there as long
01:24:49 as it has enough like community support or whatever. Yeah, I don't know. I've seen a I assume you've
01:24:55 seen like, the Jim Sterling like digital homicide. I'm familiar with it in general. Yeah.
01:25:01 Yeah, like, I mean, the digital homicide games are just their trap, their asset flips. They're
01:25:09 not illegal, per se. But, you know, they basically only they only made sales by promoting themselves
01:25:16 with like giveaways and like some like dodgy like, like, you know, reward programs and stuff like
01:25:23 they would like give you steam credit in exchange for buying their games or some weird, some weird
01:25:30 shit. Yeah. And I mean, but you know, I've never really understood look, it's fun. I totally get
01:25:35 Jim saying that they're terrible games in talking mad shit. But I've always like, what's the real
01:25:41 problem here? Are those games being promoted above games that deserve it more? Is that like the
01:25:46 issue? And are consumers being taken advantage of in some way? I mean, I don't know who's to say
01:25:52 that like, you know, that they are, I think like, like terrible and no one wants to play them, you
01:25:57 know, I don't know. I don't think that was with digital homicide. I think the real problem was
01:26:02 their like frivolous lawsuits against a guy for criticizing. Well, that okay, I get that I get
01:26:07 that in that case that that's what like the controversy was other than the fact that they're
01:26:12 just I mean, yeah, I think it was like Jim played the games, shit talk them and then like lawsuits
01:26:17 ensued and that was bullshit. Like he's allowed to shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well,
01:26:22 that all sounds fine to me. You know, I don't know. It is it is kind of cool that it is kind of
01:26:30 cool that just any old fucking thing can get on there because sometimes, you know, sometimes an
01:26:33 amateur piece of shit or not a piece of sometimes an amateur project that's made with little technical
01:26:38 still can skill still have like a cool aesthetic or like a cool idea somewhere in it that that that
01:26:44 can indeed, you know, resonate with people and that and that's neat. So I don't know. I guess,
01:26:52 you know, to achieve that steam kind of had to sort of bite the bullet and be like, okay, well,
01:26:58 we don't really have any quality standards. Yeah, in terms of what's allowed in our plan,
01:27:02 but you know, they can still curate in the sense of what the total opposite of Epic's approach,
01:27:07 where like they're, I think it's Epic anyway, like they are curating like they want good big games,
01:27:12 like only on their shit, which, you know, that's fine. I'd be interested to see who does better
01:27:16 long term just for the sake of is Epic like the is that like the four? Yes, that's correct. That's
01:27:21 correct. Okay. Oh, there. Yeah, they're they're getting involved in the in the distribution of
01:27:25 games game. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. They're they're big. They're they're doing well. Was there anything
01:27:33 else I was going to say on that? I can't wait for Disney to own Fortnite. When the buy out it when
01:27:39 the buy out Epic games. Disney's buying everything. No. What? What's wrong? What? What don't you like?
01:27:46 Ben? I don't understand. What wouldn't you like about about Disney owning? I can't wait to see
01:27:51 Mickey flossing. Oh my god. Yes. This is a perfect segue. Yeah. Perfect segue into my life. Do the
01:28:01 first tunnel. So sorry. He sort of unlocked new Keyblade Orange Justice. You know, that's a Fortnite
01:28:15 thing, right? I don't know, but it sounds right. Did you know that Sora does do a big old dab
01:28:20 in Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance? Fuck. Yeah, no, I didn't know that. He does it.
01:28:26 He's a killer. He's a killer through and through. That's true.
01:28:30 Well, speaking of big corporations, I paid my taxes this week. The United States,
01:28:38 the corporation that it is. Well, I'm just mad. I'm just mad that I paid more than Amazon in
01:28:44 taxes. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm just throwing that out there as a point. Argue
01:28:48 amongst yourselves about the justice inherent in that. It's not that you, well, like, what do you
01:28:55 mean? What? What? Say it. Well, I'll kill you. Okay. Amazon provides value through its commerce,
01:29:01 like, and so they make deals with particular constituencies to, you know, get like their
01:29:08 costs mitigated because, I mean, you know, why does the state make this a deal? Because Amazon
01:29:14 provides them value and like, they're getting something in exchange for it. So, you know,
01:29:18 instead of paying money. Yes. And the end result is that they make $11 billion in profits and pay
01:29:24 no taxes. And I, Ben St, internet, indie content creator, make, you know, you know, struggle and
01:29:32 scratch my way up to crack the fucking five digit mark and pay more than them to the American
01:29:38 government. So that's pretty neat. Well, good stuff. Good stuff. I would argue if that's as
01:29:44 much of an injustice as it is being framed as, but I know we disagree on these, these topics
01:29:50 to a degree. Apparently, apparently so. So we did that. Also, so I was like, gone from the internet
01:29:59 for a while. Like, I, yeah, everyone thought I was dead. Everyone thought yet, right, because I,
01:30:03 yeah, I was like, yeah, desperately trying to get a hold of it. Everyone was trying to reach me.
01:30:09 I was off the internet. I did. Hold on. Okay. You were off the internet, but why didn't you
01:30:14 answer the calls that Nate sent you? I mean, Ben also just doesn't keep his phone. I don't look
01:30:18 at my phone. I wasn't looking at my phone. I did my taxes. I reorganized my room, which was a very
01:30:25 gratifying experience. He gives the mental map of your room. Well, my bed is now it's not in the,
01:30:32 it's not in the far left corner. It's in the near left corner and it's vertically oriented
01:30:37 instead of horizontal. I understand. Yeah. So I have a lot more, I moved, okay, okay. I had like
01:30:43 my dresser sort of tucked into a tiny little alcove, little corner part of my room that was
01:30:48 completely inaccessible. So I moved that out to my actual floor. So now I can actually keep my clothes
01:30:54 in it and access them. Oh, nice. It's great. It's really, it's really great. I no longer just have,
01:30:58 my clothes are no longer just in a big old fucking pile on my floor. They're actually
01:31:01 endorsement. I have a quote unquote clothes closet, but what that is is a repository where I dump all
01:31:07 my clean clothes in this closet and I have never folded them or attempted to organize them. I sift
01:31:13 through the pile for clothes. I'm surprised. I know. I'm surprised. I think people would be surprised
01:31:17 about the some of the slovenly aspects to my life that I don't broadcast publicly very often,
01:31:23 but this is one of them. My room is actually pretty neat. By doing all this, I opened up a lot
01:31:28 more floor space in front of my windows and now I realize that I need, much like the dude,
01:31:33 I need a rug. I have this empty floor and I need a rug. I'm looking at the space right now and it
01:31:38 would really tie the room together. I watched The Big Lebowski just the other day again. It was
01:31:41 good. It's very good. It's a good, it's a good film. Yeah. I just got this, this void, this empty void
01:31:47 of hardwood on my, well, it's, and it's just, it just cries out. It cries out to be covered with a
01:31:53 decorative item. Get that, get some sort of killer print rug or something, you know.
01:32:00 What print? A killer print? Yeah, you know. We don't sell rugs. Yeah, unfortunately. Red
01:32:04 Bubble does everything. We sell, we sell throw blankets and tapestries, which I now sleep under.
01:32:10 I now sleep directly under my giant cop killer insignia, drawn by, drawn by slimes, that good boy.
01:32:18 And it's a good, it's a good time. Anyway, my, my life feels less cluttered and I feel a little
01:32:24 less stressed to just exist in my living space. I was, I was pretty stressed about taxes as well.
01:32:29 I don't know, I keep my apartment relatively clean, but taxes was weighing on me, but it's all out
01:32:34 of there and it's done and that makes me feel good. You know, okay, okay. So I was doing my taxes
01:32:38 right. I go to mass.gov and I, and they're like, click here to go to an internet website where
01:32:43 you can do your taxes online. And you're like, Erin at website never heard of it and you stop.
01:32:48 I'm suspicious. So I do that and I go there, right? And it's getting late in the day. And, but you
01:32:53 know, I still got time. Like I'm assuming I have until midnight and then the fucking website goes
01:32:58 down at like 8pm and it doesn't come back on until like half till midnight and I'm late.
01:33:03 Yeah. And I'm, and because of that, I end up being late. I don't send it out until like 2am and I'm
01:33:07 like, fuck. However, however, so I was at the Boston comics round table this Thursday and, you
01:33:14 know, after announced, we're all just kind of shooting the shit and someone, and I'm talking
01:33:18 about this and someone tells me like, Hey, actually, due to, I don't remember some legal
01:33:23 technicality. She's, she's like, actually, technically, you're not, you're in the clear as
01:33:28 long as you got him in before the 17th. And I'm like, all right, if you say so, I'm going to choose
01:33:33 to believe that. And that means everything's great. So yeah, did my fucking taxes like a good boy.
01:33:40 Well, that's great. We all did them far too late, though. We got a next year, January rolls around.
01:33:46 I can't, can you believe that people do them in fucking January? You know who does it there?
01:33:51 Who doesn't in January? Jesse, Jesse did his like in January, right? As a new year hit.
01:33:56 And I'm just like, well, shit, I gotta, I gotta get on that, man. I had all the paperwork ready.
01:34:01 I just had to fucking organize it. It was just too lazy. So I, yeah, you know, like,
01:34:05 there was nothing stopping me from doing it early. On the other hand, there were no consequences for
01:34:10 me doing it late. Lesson learned. So what, so what's the lesson here really? Ask for forgiveness,
01:34:17 not for permission. You know, just proceed until apprehended. Did you see that tweet that I made
01:34:23 munchy about that? I did. I had no idea. I learned it from my mom. So I thought she invented it,
01:34:29 but I guess she didn't. Nate, did you see that? It sounds familiar, but I can't remember about that
01:34:34 lady. Yeah. Oh, yeah. The Navy lady, whatever. The Navy lady. Yeah. Okay. I always thought that
01:34:40 that quote was from Teddy Roosevelt because it just sounds like something he would say, right?
01:34:45 But in fact, it was the better to beg better to ask forgiveness than ask permission was from
01:34:53 God, I want to say Gail Lord Shuler, but it's definitely not her. Gail Lord Shoemaker. Gail
01:35:00 Lord Shuler. Grace Hopper, who I don't know. I, God, who was it? It was, I was watching some
01:35:09 fucking YouTuber. It might have been Cosmo, Cosmo, not Cosmonaut, Cosmo Kramer, something. I don't
01:35:16 know. Okay. Whatever. It was some YouTuber and they mentioned it offhand. And I, they mentioned
01:35:22 this person. I was like, wait a minute, that wasn't Teddy Roosevelt. And it looked her up.
01:35:25 And she's so fucking cool. She's like a mathematician. She's like a 1930s, like
01:35:30 mathematician woman who like was fucking a rear admiral in the fucking Navy and did it
01:35:37 till she was 79 and like helped invent like early computing code. That's right. That's right. And
01:35:43 then I found this quote about her that one of her, her like contemporaries says, she looks all Navy,
01:35:49 but when you reach inside, you find a pirate dying to be released. And I was like, whoa.
01:35:54 And I thought that was pretty much the coolest thing I'd heard about in a long time.
01:35:59 Yeah, she's pretty cool. I remember hearing about it a while back. Computing pioneer. Yeah,
01:36:03 pretty cool. Yeah. Cool. How, I don't know. Fucking neat. I think in my computer science
01:36:07 education, she came up if I remember correctly. Oh, really? I think so. Oh, right. Yeah. You
01:36:12 got like, you went to like school and shit for that or whatever. Indeed. Yeah. Well, I mean,
01:36:17 early computing is pretty dope. You know, there was another lady like in like the 1700s. Her
01:36:22 nickname, her nickname is grandma cobalt after like cobalt, the language. Yeah. That's cool.
01:36:29 That's cool. That's cute. I thought there was like another lady of like the 1800s or something
01:36:33 that like developed what was effectively like a very early computing language with like weird
01:36:39 like animal like before computers existed or something. I don't know. That's crazy with that.
01:36:43 Could be women doing things, like having thoughts. I meant more so the 1800s part,
01:36:49 but also no, no, that wasn't purely my expression. That was not mocking you. No, no, no.
01:36:55 Yeah. No, but that seems pretty early to be making proto computer. Yeah, I might be a little
01:37:01 fudging the numbers there. I remember there was something like that. I don't know. I don't know.
01:37:05 Yeah. I don't know. I've heard that like ancient, God, I don't know. This could be fake. I've heard
01:37:11 that like ancient peoples have like clay jars or something with like metal, like a specific kind
01:37:20 of metal rod inside. And it was like, if you filled this thing with like vinegar or some sort of
01:37:27 acidic substance or something like that, it would have like an energy imbalance to be created.
01:37:32 And it actually would create like a small electric current. And I think it was used to like
01:37:37 electro plate gold onto other metals. And I don't know how that works at all. But yeah,
01:37:43 I've heard that there were like relatively ancient peoples that had this sort of rudimentary way
01:37:48 to create electricity and do like some weird like pseudo electrical shit. Okay, big if true. Do you
01:37:56 guys ever think I like, okay, this is like a weird and I have no idea what people I'm even talking
01:38:02 about. This is like a barely remembered factoid. Not an insignificant part of my life. Just like
01:38:09 thinking about it is like comprised of like thinking about like ancient humans and about how we
01:38:16 arrived at this point. I think about it like every day for like hours. Possibly because you're
01:38:23 effectively a caveman displaced in time, sent to the far future. Yeah, it might as well be. I'm
01:38:28 in Neanderthal. Yeah. Okay, I think about whenever I'm at a restaurant and thinking about like,
01:38:34 this is impossible. There's no way this could possibly have happened. This isn't how like like
01:38:38 earth was meant to be. Not as like it's bad, but just isn't like this is insane. This is
01:38:42 fucking crazy that I'm a rough God's plan. Yeah. And I just I just often think about like how like
01:38:49 fucking like insane it is that we do any of the stuff we like like who was the first person
01:38:54 to like even do stuff like as like as in like like fire, right? First person to put like meat
01:39:01 over fire. Like why? That's insane. That's insane. That's madness. That's God actually. Yeah. Okay,
01:39:06 I understand. So, so have some respect. Yeah. Why would you think to do that? Yeah. I mean a lot
01:39:12 of us could have just been accidental and that people just learned from it. Well surely like
01:39:16 but just like I don't know like there's so many things like we've we've so crawled up from dirt
01:39:22 and grime and nothing. Yeah. You know, you know, I was thinking about that as like I was eating an
01:39:27 avocado the other day and I was like what is it some natural instinct that made the first person
01:39:34 like pick a fruit and like eat it like what made them like okay you're you're you don't know shit
01:39:40 about the world you've been born into from nothingness and you're and you're clueless and like
01:39:45 you're sure you're hungry but like how do you know to eat a thing? Well, there's an answer to that.
01:39:51 There's an answer to that. How do you how do you look at like a wild fucking a piece of like wild
01:39:55 mustard seed and think like I should put that thing in obviously this president for eating but
01:40:01 like you know it has to start somewhere and obviously started like a like literally like like
01:40:05 like the cell level first right and evolution you know bake that into us as it went along presumably
01:40:11 the cooking thing. Well, here's what I'm if you were like just born I mean I guess if you're just
01:40:15 born and like no one tells you anything and you're just a baby right yeah I guess you'll probably
01:40:20 just have a natural instinct. Well, you'll also pick it up from people around you. Claw your way
01:40:24 towards a fruit and eat it. I would think so humans humans aren't the blank slates that we sometimes
01:40:28 think of them are you know there's some instincts baked in there yeah even though we're you know
01:40:32 again off God's path but uh uh sure you know like like monkeys yeah dude fuck hell yeah monkeys I
01:40:39 if I remember correctly I believe monkeys in some areas they do like brew alcohol like there's some
01:40:45 like again I don't I don't think it's like intentional I think that there is some area I
01:40:51 think I think I heard about this on Joe Rogan at some point that like there's some monkeys that like
01:40:54 cater to like fermenting fruit and it like generates alcohol that they enjoy because it you know gets
01:41:00 them fucked up or whatever uh I could be crazy but I I remember hearing something like that and
01:41:04 that sounds like the sort of thing that's kind of a happy accident that they've you know adapted to
01:41:09 or you know they're they're what limited intelligence they have you know I know monkeys are pretty smart
01:41:15 I guess but like yeah they they appreciate okay I looked it up apparently apparently they they
01:41:21 extract sap from a raffia palm trees and then they let the sap ferment creating a palm wine
01:41:28 there you go and it seems I mean the wording of this article seems to imply that they're
01:41:33 doing it on purpose which yeah I guess so shocking if true so I mean tangentially related to this I
01:41:42 also often think about like going back in time or bring people into the future to like explain the
01:41:47 way the world is and it's about how weird it would be to do that this is I don't understand why I do
01:41:53 this again takes up like vast swaths of my life and I don't know why I think about it so often
01:42:00 you know I always think about like bringing historical leaders into the president being like
01:42:04 here's what a plane is and they're like oh my god that's so crazy I'm like I know right and that's
01:42:08 like the end of the thought uh thinking about it all the time every and then pick a new historical
01:42:13 figure exactly literally exactly I think I know everything would have been relatively normal I
01:42:19 think like uh uh if you brought George Washington to up up to like spend that all the time like like
01:42:26 the 80s or you know a little before like the 60s or something well maybe even a little bit before
01:42:31 that George bring George Washington to like uh let's say the 20s or something they have like he
01:42:35 would have seen he would have seen people doing the twist and had a heart from the sheer impropriety
01:42:41 of it all yes exactly it uh uh like up to that point like they started to have like telegrams
01:42:46 and telephones I think around then so like the world was starting to be connected no when was the
01:42:51 telephone uh the telephone well depends on how about telephone but like like telegram 1800s
01:42:58 like a second half okay okay so that that happened pretty cool oh well you know what how did how did
01:43:02 they play the game of telephone before the telephone wasn't damn that's a good question no idea um uh
01:43:09 well my point is like humans were relatively stagnant I think until we started like even if
01:43:15 with like guns and stuff again that's still you got to go into a field and march around and shoot
01:43:19 people you know whatever you gotta make your way off base say your point but it makes no sense and
01:43:25 it's wrong once we got like telegrams telephones and now at this point we're at the point where
01:43:30 imagine explaining like the concept of social media that we all like we're we're basically
01:43:36 psychically connected to every other member of the human race on the planet yeah through these
01:43:41 kind of like opt-in systems of like Twitter and you know YouTube and all this stuff it's a totally
01:43:47 that's the biggest mindfuck it'd be like if like you know like 50 100 200 years or whatever
01:43:53 us going to a future where literally everyone lives in VR like all the time and like the earth is just
01:43:58 like a caretaker for our useless corpses that bring our consciousness to the data realm or whatever
01:44:04 uh strikes me similar to that um but yeah I'd be pretty kooky pretty cool man like the thoughts
01:44:14 interesting right I don't know it just it's on my mind constantly thinking about how different we
01:44:20 are from what we were like I don't know programmed to do I mean that's where anyone thinks that like
01:44:25 I don't know like I'm not pooing at it at all like even slightly it's just an interesting thought to
01:44:30 see how far we've come from what we were you know this thing I've been saying of like escaping from
01:44:34 God's plan is is is true in the sense of like we like there's like a certain you know god of like
01:44:41 nature whatever it's like you get to a certain point and like evolutionarily you're basically
01:44:45 doing the same thing that like your other apes are doing but just at some point when over the tipping
01:44:49 point and we just had like I don't know they say like the agricultural like the ability of humans
01:44:55 to like settle down and grow food I think was like the first thing that like allowed humans to really
01:44:58 flourish and like save up stories for when there was famines because like without that you know
01:45:03 most humans would have continually died off when there's like a bad season or whatever uh so you
01:45:08 you know we just we get a little bit ahead you get a little bit up in the game with your stores
01:45:12 and you're able to breed a little bit more and spread out a little further and then you're just
01:45:16 over the hill your crew and interest on your vast sums you know it's basically capitalism at work
01:45:20 only human capital you got a little bit over the top it just interests it's paying for itself
01:45:25 it's human centered capitalism yang 2020 it makes sense um yeah yeah I don't know it's just cool
01:45:32 it just it's interesting to me that like bringing like Genghis Khan I don't know what year he lived
01:45:37 bringing him to like you know 30 hundreds if I recall correctly sorry when was that when was that
01:45:42 1300s bringing someone like him to like George Washington's day would not be that big a difference
01:45:49 uh but bringing him to our day just uh you know a couple hundred years after that that's a huge
01:45:55 difference and I guess it all shows up in like the the way that like the graph of like technological
01:45:59 advancement is just like it's gone fucking you know parallel wait hold on no George he would be
01:46:05 shocked and appalled if he went to george what that was like that like the industrial
01:46:09 revolution that yeah it would have been insane it was well I question like if they had the
01:46:14 fucking cotton gin but they did not have the kind of those are like economic and like they oh okay
01:46:20 they didn't have okay they didn't have the cotton gin but they had like I mean it's just that those
01:46:23 strength me is like economic factors and like well-being of man factors well okay there are
01:46:29 many factors that would shock and appall him it completely different culture completely different
01:46:34 technology completely different almost like like terrain like everything they had they had
01:46:40 factories I mean I guess for some reason not my mind focuses on like the the communication
01:46:45 well I mean in in george washington's day they had no I know I know not in this they did they did
01:46:53 but they are different like mechanized yeah yeah yeah sure well uh things are I mean I think the
01:46:59 I think like a city like like the the concept of the city was just like structured completely
01:47:05 differently well like George Washington's day versus like what they was for for okay hold on I just
01:47:11 want to say that like okay look there's there's many different things as opposed to like Genghis Khan
01:47:19 the Mongol emperor to George Washington in America there are so many like of course Genghis Khan would
01:47:26 be like what's the city and then burn it down I'm kind of think of like the human well no you know
01:47:31 I'm saying that like you know I know that he would know what it is but like the it's not the same
01:47:37 right he ruled over a lot of cities I'm like he's generally like a nomadic guy he comes from that
01:47:42 background if you just want to see it you know if you just killed George Washington and put Genghis Khan
01:47:48 in charge and like he you know he knew what was going on like I think that like the world had not
01:47:53 changed so much like his understanding of like men and like okay he'd have to learn about guns
01:47:58 probably but okay you can learn what guns do like I feel like he could adapt but seeing either of
01:48:03 those adapt to like modern technology I think is is a whole nother ball game no completely disagree
01:48:10 I mean completely wrong enough face and retarded well well boomers can't even adapt to today's
01:48:15 yeah there you go they're they're they're they've just figured out facebook just in time to watch
01:48:21 crumble you you underestimate how much has changed just constantly throughout like like I suppose
01:48:32 I'm gonna kind of go with Nate here I think that the well okay it has changed more rapidly
01:48:38 it's accelerated sure okay okay if your point is if like
01:48:43 like like like it's it's changing faster now I definitely agree with that I'm saying well you
01:48:51 know okay I guess I shouldn't say that like the um I just meant your specific example I thought was
01:48:57 off base but you're like your idea that like you know it changed slower that's definitely true I
01:49:01 know yeah that that's that's the main point I don't know whatever let's you know what let's go to
01:49:06 fucking voicemail okay wait wait I feel like I had I feel like I had something else like maybe there
01:49:13 was one of any other of the famous quote unquote events in your life oh fuck off dude yes my events
01:49:20 you don't even know what that meant uh I don't wait did it mean something uh wait what did it mean
01:49:25 well that's open to interpretation wait what did it mean well what did it mean though I mean uh the
01:49:30 the joke that I was making I guess was that like your life what did it mean no has few things that
01:49:37 would be considered legitimate events uh yes uh something like that yeah hold on wait no I got
01:49:42 that I got that I need to retract a point for my own for my own personal well-being because I know one
01:49:47 of those one of you motherfuckers are writing a comic about how Genghis Khan of course you notice
01:49:51 it is yes obviously I know that he fucking you roll over like literally like you know like all
01:49:57 like northern China I know I know he noticed our vast audience of history he's seen a lot of people
01:50:01 in one place I know what he knows what I meant was just that you know comes from a nomadic background
01:50:06 he'd probably be a little bit shocked by like the way the cities had progressed at that time
01:50:10 uh uh based on guys I know well that's what I that's what I said like the the way a city was
01:50:14 structured would just look it would I mean the art it would look different like you know they didn't
01:50:18 have modern you know like building techniques and shit yeah I mean not to mention the the culture
01:50:24 and and stuff and just I got it I am smart please no no no no no no Nate I'm not I'm not cheating on
01:50:29 you at all I'm just I'm just saying for my for my own point I don't want anyone to make fun of me
01:50:33 in the comments that's literally right yeah no no no I gotcha you guys you guys watch that uh you
01:50:38 guys watch that they're uh Jordan Peterson versus Slavo Gizek I hope I'm saying no of course no I
01:50:43 don't think so who's Slavo Gizek you know I wish I knew more about the guy he is uh he is kind of a
01:50:51 he is kind of a cool Marxist guy but he's also very yeah those are your synonymous dude right
01:50:58 he's he's like he's like a he's like a Marxist psychologist philosopher but he's also very
01:51:03 like anti SJW okay which is okay I think I heard of this guy I don't I have heard of him a lot and
01:51:09 I I kind of want to dig into his stuff more now uh I don't know okay never mind I thought me I kind
01:51:15 of thought maybe you guys would have checked I would have thought that Nate would but it's the
01:51:20 it's the sort of thing I watch uh you know and and it's very like uh Jordan's all like hey here's
01:51:28 why capitalism's good and Marx's and Erdon Marx Gizek is like well here's the problems with it and
01:51:35 you know it's it's uh Gizek's is very just a very like entertaining guy he's he's very he's very
01:51:42 charming as uh Jordan points out that's uh mr. Peterson uh ask doctor doctor question on the
01:51:50 honorable please the the the rya arbald the lord mayor of kekistan you know I kind of I kind of
01:51:58 expecting I kind of went into expecting to be like rude and hardcore against dr. p and being like
01:52:03 yeah fuck you sure and I mean I didn't really agree with him I still didn't really agree with his
01:52:08 opinions but like I didn't like get mad at him during it or anything it was all very fine and
01:52:14 you know reasonable discourse I guess you know I obviously haven't watched this I've watched a
01:52:19 bunch of Peterson stuff over the years uh you know I'm sure some people disagree I mean I hear people
01:52:24 like I don't know I hear things like some people just like call him like a transphobe and I'm like
01:52:30 what I don't think that's an accurate statement I don't think you're assessing the the situation
01:52:35 oh you know what I forgot because like the original controversy was that he didn't want to be
01:52:38 like whatever he didn't want to be like forced to use pronouns that he didn't think legitimate or
01:52:42 whatever uh so I again I can follow the logic to get to that conclusion but I don't know uh so I
01:52:49 get it obviously I'm not one of those peeps who might take a personal issue whether anything
01:52:54 but like he's always strike me as a as a relatively honest actor and I suppose you know if one was like
01:52:59 a hardcore Marxist he is a devout capitalist and you know enjoys making money and profiting off
01:53:05 his ventures so like I could see people being like ah he's you know a fucking fraud just trying to
01:53:09 make money or something but I don't know he seems pretty seems relatively legit to me and I mean
01:53:15 you know I mean I mean I think he's he's he oh man Anthony Fantano made a tweet like today I've
01:53:24 seen some of his I think and it was like you know uh Peterson is a I don't think he called him a
01:53:32 shit yeah but basically he's like he is he he just like he caters to you know he caters to like
01:53:39 these like guys who just want their own biases regurgitated back at them you know sprinkled
01:53:43 in with like you know a small amount of like you know good advice aren't we all like that though
01:53:50 and I mean like yeah I think that's probably sure sure uh and uh yeah you know he he loves he loves
01:54:00 he loves capitalism and I'm not as and I'm not its biggest fan um and I mean you know so he's
01:54:07 so fuck that guy that's that's fair you know when I like I've seen Fantano really shit on
01:54:12 this guy in the past in various times and like look I get it uh he disagrees with him politically
01:54:18 and you know I would suspect that like he kind of gets into like a more personal like finding the
01:54:24 guy to be like fake like if you already don't agree with the guy's ideas the fact that like
01:54:28 he markets himself well that's probably gonna rub you the wrong way like I get it but you know why
01:54:34 would that be I don't I don't know if I I mean it's possible maybe he doesn't really believe the
01:54:41 things that he says and he's just saying them because they make him a ton of money I mean
01:54:46 that's not the craziest thing I've ever heard I don't think I mean I'm not you know I don't think
01:54:53 there's like a you can prove that you know yeah you know and I think a lot of people they they get
01:54:59 kind of in the space of like they they want that to be true so they read into various things like
01:55:05 ways to it and like I can't even say they're wrong they're probably correct it's just I very much like
01:55:11 to be charitable in my interpretations and like like just for example if you're like trans and you
01:55:16 feel attacked by what the guys say I mean I could argue all day that like you shouldn't feel attacked
01:55:21 that's not his point but like you feel how you feel so what can I do you know I mean I mean I think
01:55:27 that probably and like this isn't just about him but about basically anyone like anyone who's like
01:55:31 you know pushing a political position or an ideology or something like if if you say something
01:55:39 and it makes and and you know people respond to it and you end up making money off it I think
01:55:44 that most people will probably I don't think it's generally you you won't be like sitting there rubbing
01:55:53 your hands to go like ooh I don't really believe this but I'm gonna continue to say it you know
01:55:58 because it makes money what's more likely to happen is you're gonna say like uh I said this
01:56:03 opinion and I had it validated you know by you know people's responses to it and by you know
01:56:09 the the amount of like capital that it generated for me you know and that's that's just gonna like
01:56:15 convince you more and they're like yeah what I said was right you know this I am right you know
01:56:19 and I and you know I have evidence like the evidence that I am right in what I say is mounting
01:56:23 and mounting indeed you know confirmation buys the work etc etc confirmation bias yeah and and you
01:56:29 get uh what's the thing it's uh the um the affirmation the affirmation gang we're like okay I
01:56:36 think I can glean what that means but yeah you like you you're like a you're like a thought leader
01:56:41 and like everyone you know you got your crew that all it looks to you because like you say the thing
01:56:46 you say the thing that is right and everyone wants you to keep saying the thing that is right so
01:56:50 that they can like stand behind you and be like yeah this guy's an expert and he says the thing
01:56:55 that's right and I agree with him and holds you up as their champion or whatever and it's like yeah I
01:56:58 gotta keep gotta keep saying this thing that's right because these these guys all tell me that
01:57:02 it's right and I mean of course it's true at any time someone who just fundamentally disagrees
01:57:06 like you know if you've just got like a hardcore Marxist or whatever like someone can come out and
01:57:10 just be like uh you know everything you're saying is wrong like you're like you're just getting swept
01:57:15 up in this like cult of personality and you're just like letting your kind like you're just saying
01:57:19 what you want to believe like again like um uh something like uh I mean just for example like
01:57:25 someone like Ben Shapiro whatever he like straight up doesn't believe in like being trans or whatever
01:57:29 due to religious and whatever like you know you could say all day that like you know this is
01:57:33 his firm belief but somebody on the other side could just say that like um you know he just he
01:57:38 wants to believe this so he's like convincing himself it's true or he doesn't believe that he's
01:57:41 just saying it anyway and at a certain point you just get you're into mind reading and I don't know
01:57:47 I I hate being in the business of mind reading uh like I don't know say say your I don't know I
01:57:53 think I think about this a bunch like say your say your Dr. P right and maybe at some point you're
01:57:58 like you know yeah I would Dr. P I'd wish I was Dr. P P and then I would get a sick uh Dr. Mario
01:58:05 uh you gotta change your name to Dr. Peter Peterson maybe Dr. P P uh classic patreon.com
01:58:12 slash bansane for quality jokes of that caliber uh the uh maybe at some point you're like you know
01:58:20 I'm a guy I'm successful I'm an academic I think capitalism is pretty good maybe there's something
01:58:28 maybe the communists have some good ideas but generally you know I think I like capitalism
01:58:32 and then you know you say all this stuff and people respond to it and you're like and you're
01:58:36 like you know I think you should clean your room and stand up straight and people respond to that
01:58:40 and you're like wow the stuff you said changed my life and then you write your book and it's a best
01:58:44 seller and then like the letters come flooding in and you're like the stuff you said changed my life
01:58:49 and I mean you know it doesn't matter how many like maybe there's people that disagree with you
01:58:52 just as much but you're hearing I mean you're hearing the haters but in your mind you gotta
01:58:56 dismiss like well those are just the haters and then you're getting all this positive
01:58:59 information people like the stuff you said changed my life it means everything to me you're a genius
01:59:03 and you're like well I mean of course you know you're gonna you like no like forget about Dr. P
01:59:11 if you're anyone like if this happens to you like this is you're of course you're gonna continue
01:59:16 to do what you're doing because you're getting this kind of a response from it that's definitely
01:59:19 true and and I just say that that's that's possible however it certainly remains a possibility as well
01:59:25 that despite all those things on you know undoubtedly happening he remains you know intellectually
01:59:30 curious and attempts to examine his own ideas and simply believes that he still is on the
01:59:35 right track and that this makes the most sense despite the ideas he's coming up against I mean
01:59:39 that's the most charitable way to interpret it yeah maybe I don't know yeah so I mean everybody
01:59:43 just has to judge for that whatever that's like to anybody um and I don't know but generally like
01:59:48 when I when it comes to listening to people like this I like to listen to and I admit it like you
01:59:52 know I was listening to destiny the other day the thing I don't like about destiny is just how mean
01:59:57 he is I don't like how mean he is and it makes me not want to listen to him because it's unpleasant
02:00:03 and maybe like I'm a pussy because I can't take the heat yeah but yeah definitely yeah I mean that's
02:00:09 for sure that's for sure but it's just I I'd rather go listen to you know uh uh some fucking like
02:00:15 Joe Rogan um and I don't know like anybody else anybody's on his fucking show just because like
02:00:22 they're respectful and nice and you know they'll they'll challenge each other and I can think
02:00:26 for my fucking self about who's right and wrong and I don't even think I'm as smart as destiny
02:00:31 especially when it comes to like a debate format or whatever it's like I'm not even saying he's
02:00:34 right or wrong but like I definitely am attracted to positivity so I like steel manning I like like
02:00:41 attacking your opponent's ideas at their best at their strongest and I try to do it as well myself
02:00:47 so I don't know I don't know what I'm getting into I'm just saying that steel manning yeah yes it's
02:00:52 good what a what a it's nice that's funny uh okay well I don't know uh would you recommend
02:00:58 that uh the the Peterson and Zizek debate thing or whatever yeah I would say so especially like
02:01:03 I didn't know much about Zizek I mean I kind of want to hear like a nice Marxist who I can
02:01:09 take seriously and you know listen to his ideas and see if I'm wrong in some ways I think you I
02:01:12 think you would I think you would appreciate him because like I I don't know much about him I've
02:01:19 heard about him a lot but I've never looked into him and like seeing him in this debate I was like
02:01:22 you know I should maybe like look into more about this guy because I don't know he seems
02:01:27 interesting and I don't know I think you would find him you know reasonable if nothing else yeah okay
02:01:32 I love politics that okay that wasn't really political that was that was as light as it could be
02:01:39 okay all right well is that p is that p you know bro oh yep there it is uh well
02:01:48 well shall we go let's go to the voicemail ladies and gentlemen uh let's let's hop on over here um
02:01:54 okay now now uh public service announcement we are getting an unforced review but by the way
02:02:01 maybe we should say that hippo is gone for technical difficulties in case you've been
02:02:04 wondering where that's true he had connections issues and they unfortunately his connect his
02:02:08 connection died a long time ago it was in and out for a while and now it seems like it's just dead
02:02:12 so that's why he's gone indeed indeed uh so have no fears ladies and gentlemen um excuse me okay so
02:02:18 public service announcement here it is uh a bunch of people are just leaving like a lot of messages
02:02:25 I don't know like like fat fuck faggot who left a whole slew I messaged my favorite like I'm gonna
02:02:30 play some because they're good what what happened he's he's spider he's he people are training his
02:02:36 spider but for fucking voicemails now why what did spider do the comments a thousand times oh
02:02:44 you meant you mentioned him in the yeah last episode that he'll just leave like four comments
02:02:49 right that's right on a video which is fine I don't know it's not I don't see the problem
02:02:56 what I mean the right or wrong I basically just I mean just because I'm busy I don't check really
02:03:00 the comment sections of like any videos of mine I check all the comments most most weeks most
02:03:07 weeks I will read through uh the comments I would if I just had the time I find it pleasant and I
02:03:12 enjoy you know and I do look a little bit I do look when like the episode first comes out I'll
02:03:15 just be curious to see what people are saying so you know I don't know if this is clear I don't
02:03:19 ever said this but like like if you're wondering I always read the comments in case you aren't
02:03:26 aware like I read everything I might not always respond but I I generally do um there I just
02:03:34 so I mean we're watching for episodes that I'm on obviously I definitely want to hear if people
02:03:39 had to say anything about the shit I said yeah that's a little good all right see there you
02:03:43 I gotta find my enemies indeed okay I gotta keep so here's the end of my public service
02:03:48 announcement it's just so people like just you can leave a bunch but you're just making my life
02:03:54 more difficult so like if some people are spamming I might just start skipping you I'll tell you that
02:03:59 that was my temptation like when I see like like six or seven messages from the same person I'm just
02:04:05 like is this really did this person have like a mission this episode and they're here like to
02:04:10 make sure I hear their quality thing they've thought of or they just spamming in the hopes
02:04:15 that something will be good and maybe something's good so give it to me straight how many how many
02:04:19 voicemails I mean it's just like 12 I think no 11 we have 11 so nothing nothing crazy but
02:04:24 I did have to cut through a bunch so so people try to you know work on it work out ladies and
02:04:29 gentlemen anything you've got to say you can say in what is it like a minute and a half is the limit
02:04:34 for and I anything you've got to say you can say it you know some people actually some person left
02:04:39 a message I forget who it was I didn't grab it but someone said like hey here's the real life hack
02:04:44 to be on a pcp episode in the voicemail just leave like a million messages and you know one of them
02:04:51 will probably be good honestly if I were you Nate I probably I would have been tempted to just not
02:04:58 look at like the messages that were posted like like six messages but you know that you know I'm
02:05:02 just saying I'm letting people know I might do maybe the first one so far maybe the so far I
02:05:06 haven't missed a single single voicemail I've listened to all of them I've heard all of the
02:05:10 depravity so okay anyway that out of the way uh let's hear what fat fuck faggot has to say okay go
02:05:17 do you must be hurt you must be hurt
02:05:37 jesse why don't you like emulators that makes no sense okay I also like emulators
02:05:43 fat fuck first of all lose some weight second of all does does jesse hate emulators he was
02:05:49 running about it I think I think you don't need a voice modulator to ask a bullshit lame question
02:05:54 this is people are looking for axe munchy I mean this fat fuck faggot left like eight messages so
02:05:59 you know yeah what's the point of a voice modulator like there's no gimmie to make it more interesting
02:06:04 for us I guess you weren't like oh fat fuck I just destroyed a fucking 10 pound chicken what's
02:06:09 your opinion on fucking emulators it yeah do do better do better fat yeah fat fuck you know what

02:12:10 people are lonely they want to hang out with women even if it doesn't mean that okay listen
02:12:13 this this is something don't really understand because like people will say that you just want to
02:12:17 hang out with women for you know like like uh you know like you know for fun you know people
02:12:22 will say that but like you have to be eaten up inside like this obviously like like it plays into
02:12:28 like a sex thing right where it's like you know obviously if they just want to have sex they would
02:12:31 order a prostitute but you know some people just want to hang out with people and just you know
02:12:36 just go on a date with them and feel that like like you know a fake romantic connection there they
02:12:40 want to have that experience right but like you know I don't believe it's purely like a platonic
02:12:45 or just a romantic thing like surely they must be like eaten up inside like oh maybe if I play the

02:13:29 travel vacation okay no hold on so you is this like a no sex website or it depends on what you
02:13:39 want I think there's the way that this is it just like the way that this girl does it I'd imagine
02:13:43 so I'd imagine so and I assume she's up front but you know so so they're oh god so these guys are
02:13:51 paying to go to date with a girl to like just go eat dinner with them they said go to a movie or
02:13:57 something or you know something like that oh boy I mean the answer to the answer to this question
02:14:06 for me would I be comfortable with it could not be simpler the answer is no uh not in a million
02:14:12 years would I be in a situation such as this uh but I mean you know I don't know yeah like well
02:14:20 do I sit here in judgment I mean whatever do what you gotta do to get by you know it's fine
02:14:24 everybody's I I want to like twist language a little bit way because I feel like the word
02:14:29 cuck needs to be defined here a little bit okay because cuck you know like like literally in the
02:14:34 dictionary is like you know it's like a sexual thing you like it I think the spectrum for sure
02:14:39 for sure I think the way that I like you're only a cuck in the way that we mean being a cuck if
02:14:45 you don't like it that could mean as in it's a surprise you as a girlfriend shielding you or is
02:14:50 just as in like no no way or or or that she wants to be in an open relationship but you don't want
02:14:55 to you're just like um yeah you know I guess we could do that um I guess we could be in a relationship
02:14:59 that's fine yeah you're like here's what I think on honestly I think I think it depends on how much
02:15:06 you trust her right like I think if you really trust her that like she's not doing anything
02:15:11 untoward with any of these guys and it's all completely above the belt platonic then I think
02:15:17 yeah I probably would be okay with it it's just that that is like that just like you're always
02:15:21 gonna wonder right you're always gonna be kind of well that's what I mean if you're like really
02:15:27 if you really know her and you really if you think you can really trust that it's not there's
02:15:33 nothing else going on then I think it is I get that Ben I mean it's a little crazy thing to think
02:15:37 I think but the thing is like maybe you trust the girl but how much you trust the guys and I'm not
02:15:42 saying like they're gonna like rape or anything I'm just saying like are all their intentions like
02:15:47 totally pure like is she never gonna get any kind of a little bit going beyond my my answer to that
02:15:53 is like I mean imagine you know imagine if you will dating a girl you know hard difficult I know
02:16:00 but like stretch stretch your mind out a little bit um you're dating I mean she's gonna have friends
02:16:05 she's gonna have her own friends and some of them you know could very well be guys and like
02:16:11 you know that like thinking about it yeah probably at least some of those guys are like
02:16:17 you know well you know they're not gonna do anything but like maybe if you guys broke up
02:16:20 then maybe they try maybe you know or maybe yeah that's for real so like so like how is how is this
02:16:26 any different I'll tell you how like you're not you're like you're not you're not gonna say oh you
02:16:29 can't hang out with your guy friends because what if they like you what if they'll try I mean well
02:16:33 first of all that kind of depends on the situation again like that's when you mean it depends on
02:16:38 the situation I would never like force anyone to do anything they want however I would absolutely
02:16:45 set ultimatums of look I'm comfortable with XYZ if you don't want it then we'll just break up that's
02:16:49 all I mean again it depends what those things are hold on like what's XYZ I mean I don't know dude
02:16:56 like if she had like a really like okay I like I knew someone okay I mean maybe there was like a
02:17:01 particular guy who like creeped you out for some specific reason this is this is just easy follow me
02:17:06 from this like I know a person who knows someone or something like I heard of a tale that like uh
02:17:12 that this is not the other gender side of it that there was like a girl who was dating a guy
02:17:16 and the thing was this guy had like a long time best friend who was female and they would do such
02:17:22 things as sleep in the same bed now they both say nothing ever happened but it's like well that's a
02:17:27 little odd uh that's kind of strange and like it like you know if you broke up with them do you
02:17:34 think that nothing would happen uh probably not probably some moves would be made um and and
02:17:39 incidentally just in this particular situation the girl the the friend who is a girl in question
02:17:44 like once spoke to the girlfriend of the guy and said like is this guy making you guys uncomfortable
02:17:51 and the guy was like oh no this is totally fine like it's totally full time don't worry about it
02:17:54 but even the girl in the friendship was detecting some vibes of probably like you know some kind of
02:18:00 beta-orbidiness around her despite being sure okay well like yeah you say like I would judge it
02:18:06 you know I don't want you sleeping in the same bed as this person well that's all I mean I would
02:18:11 judge on the specifics that's that's all it is yeah okay okay makes makes sense well that's what
02:18:17 I'm saying is like if you're like I don't know it just comes down to trust I guess is is the
02:18:23 is my final word on the subject and that's maybe all there is maybe I'm a caveman stuck in the past
02:18:29 but I would absolutely say that like cuckoldry is 100 a spectrum and to me to me it's not so much
02:18:37 about what the person wants it's about like kind of the value signified by it like it just strikes
02:18:43 me as like if you're a man who is dating a woman who let's just say is a porn star for example
02:18:49 like I'm sure there's a pride that can be gained from that of a certain kind but on the other hand
02:18:55 she's literally having sex with other men like maybe you're also having sex with other people
02:18:59 but to me like to me this signifies kind of like a weak relationship like a weak bond and you know
02:19:05 what maybe that's presentive uh it is presentive and I don't care I stand by it I think I think
02:19:13 I mean you know maybe all right you're dating a porn star right she's having sex with other guys
02:19:19 because that's your job maybe you're having sex with other women or whatever sure but maybe just
02:19:25 you know maybe the sex is not like what your relationship is about look I mean I'm sure that
02:19:31 there's maybe maybe you're both you're both doing that under other circumstances and like your
02:19:36 relationship is founded on other there's there can be a massive difference between sex for porn
02:19:41 as opposed to like you know make it look call me a dinosaur and maybe I'm just wrong it could be
02:19:46 proved wrong but I believe that like sexual intimacy is like important to a relationship and isn't
02:19:52 really something to be treated trivially uh so like you know like two people dating each other uh if
02:19:58 they're like both fucking other people but they say they love each other like okay I believe them
02:20:03 it's just like it would that be as strong a bond if they didn't fuck other people I suspect no but
02:20:09 again I'm no fucking expert here I'm just saying you I mean uh you know it's a I think it's
02:20:16 up to the individual and I'm gonna I think it could be I think I think it could be just as I think
02:20:21 it could be just as strong or opinion on someone else's relationship look people can do whatever
02:20:26 they want obviously I'm just saying this is where my mind goes all right I think it could be fine um
02:20:32 but and to me see it's a it's a very hot I I hate to repeat myself uh just I just
02:20:41 like you like this situation I would be okay with it if I trusted that there was that it was all
02:20:47 totally platonic and that in in the situation which is really fucking weird that is an extremely
02:20:54 high threshold of trust sure that would have to be hit because this whole situation is just so
02:20:59 fucking sketchy right um my my thing is again it's only a cuck if you're not okay with it like
02:21:06 if you're dating a porn star I would say that's you're not a cuck because you know like if you're
02:21:11 if you're if you're like if it's the boundaries are clear you have clearly ordained it and you
02:21:16 have made peace with it internally then like no you're just comfortable with something that other
02:21:20 people wouldn't be and I don't think that's a cuck thing yeah I think well yeah if you if you have
02:21:26 no qualms about this you aren't a cuck well okay but the question is should he have
02:21:31 quality here's the question here's the question that comes to my mind wouldn't it be great
02:21:36 for this man like would this person in any way prefer a situation where everything's the same
02:21:41 it's just the girl has a different job earns the same and isn't you know selling her body
02:21:47 effectively you know not in a sexual way she's not selling her she's not selling her attention
02:21:52 if it's okay let's say she is because my answer would be the same and and that's like that you
02:21:57 know you sure he could prefer it but if he doesn't have a problem with it then it's fun but see that
02:22:02 right there that preference is the spectrum of cuckledry at work in my opinion my my read on this
02:22:09 situation and this guy and I could be wrong but what I what I infer from it and I guess is that
02:22:17 the problem is that maybe this is all not platonic right and that is the source of the
02:22:23 yeah consternation he wouldn't be asking this if he didn't have doubts and I think the fact that
02:22:27 you do you might have doubts in any way is that it's not okay yeah that that yes the fact that
02:22:34 you're even asking this question I mean I mean look we can speculate all day about like trust
02:22:39 levels I'd be out of there in a fucking second dude I'd drop it like a hot potato and be gone
02:22:45 I don't I don't know like just imagine a situation where you find a girl who doesn't do this there's
02:22:50 plenty of them let me let me let me just let me just say my piece imagine like you know maybe you're
02:22:55 like maybe you've been friends maybe you've known this girl for like years and maybe maybe you guys
02:23:00 are like soulmates maybe you guys tell each other everything you're like super close she just and
02:23:05 then you know she starts doing this because it makes good money and she's totally open up front
02:23:09 with you about it and she's like none of this is all platonic I'm not comfortable with doing
02:23:13 anything beyond that it's just that it makes good money and like you know it's not hard work so I'm
02:23:17 gonna do it and maybe she does it and maybe like you talk about maybe she tells you funny stories
02:23:22 of these weird guys and you laugh about it together or something and like there's no any there's no
02:23:26 and you have no doubts at all that everything she's telling you is the unadulterated truth
02:23:31 I don't know that seems fine my only response to that is that uh uh uh oneitis is the deadliest
02:23:38 virus known to man that's all I've got to say about that what just move on get another bitch uh no
02:23:44 problem wait what the what the I'm just okay well then let me only semi move on and just
02:23:51 can we talk can we talk about this service because I'm still really confused I mean you just look
02:23:55 maybe I should I mean it's you could think of it like craigslist only for semi sexual acts too full
02:24:00 on sexual acts I think you just go there you like find the listings and you're like oh I want to do
02:24:04 this and then you message him and I think you just talk about and stuff is it just is it just
02:24:10 rich guys wanting to feel us mostly I may not rich guys but people also sugar babies who want to
02:24:15 find a rich guy to you know pay their bills it as I mean that makes sense right well I yeah you're
02:24:24 right that's probably look you know what I think seeing the range is a little more broad I'm sure
02:24:27 that there's probably just people who just like want friends and they just go on there like I'm
02:24:31 not I'm not casting judgment on the website frankly I don't give a shit it's you know friends did you
02:24:35 say they go on here to find me yes I think so like it's a huge spectrum of like that's that's not
02:24:40 how they that's not how they've branded maybe I'm not not friends in the way you know more than we
02:24:45 do Ben at this point you've gone to the website I have seen the homepage so I know I'm pretty much
02:24:50 an expert you know what Ben please everyone in the show notes there's gonna be a link to this dude's
02:24:55 wife please utilize her services she's gonna be really she needs it she needs it test test
02:25:03 and don't be afraid to get a little rough with her we I hear that she's down for that so okay
02:25:08 I will just say that on the spectrum of cuckoldry I would say that normal committed relationship
02:25:14 zero cuckoldry things like your your girl being like a sexualized snapchat model is another thing
02:25:23 doing the kind of like patreon ludes as so famously are done it's absolutely on the spectrum
02:25:28 then there's like porn stars in there somewhere I'd say and then there's full on getting cupped
02:25:33 like down at the deep end that that's a big jump down to that but we're all we're all on the spectrum
02:25:37 we're all on the spectrum and I'm and I'm just saying if you got you if you got what you're
02:25:43 comfortable with and you are fully convinced that those boundaries are not being crossed then
02:25:51 what's the problem yeah I was Ben I was Ben but again like don't be afraid to trust your instincts
02:25:57 if you feel uncomfortable I'd say that's very normal yeah and and I mean and I mean whatever
02:26:01 and and like set whatever boundaries you want yeah right like I'm not saying like like if your
02:26:06 boundaries are you know that you're not comfortable with the dates at all even if they are supposedly
02:26:12 platonic when it comes when it comes to or if your boundaries are farther than that that's fine
02:26:16 I mean sure if you're comfortable with that yeah yeah yeah yeah whatever they are you know I think
02:26:20 our culture likes to push inclusivity in some of this stuff when it might feel wrong for you
02:26:26 so like I don't know like hey man everybody's in a polyamorous relationship don't let that you know
02:26:31 don't let that I mean no there's nothing that I would not judge or think there was anything wrong
02:26:37 with not being okay with this yeah right I mean just as it's okay to feel okay about it yeah so it
02:26:42 is on the contrary as well so and it because it's you man it's you so uh do whatever you want do
02:26:47 whatever you want okay well that was that was an interesting question yeah there's a lot to unpack
02:26:52 there um that was a good that was a good question it didn't have a voice modulator and if only
02:26:57 when someone was looking out for the quality of these questions if only if only he had ended the
02:27:03 question with a piano yeah then he really would have a reclinch unfortunately he's being deleted

02:29:11 well you see but it was posted on patreon.com slash uh been saying oh interesting oh my favorite my
02:29:17 my homepage my go-to destination for all things entertainment on the internet my my hub my hub
02:29:22 for con for indie content yeah my hit my my hub for underfunded indie content and let's let's keep it
02:29:29 that way ladies and gentlemen all right guys guys tax guys taxes were fucking brutal are you are you
02:29:36 gonna get a refund though oh no really you're not like under the threshold or whatever well here
02:29:43 i don't i don't know how it works exactly here here's the thing that all my income all of my income
02:29:49 was um what what do you call it self-employment so with self-employment income so i okay my expenses
02:29:56 brought me well under the uh the taxable income like level but that doesn't matter because with
02:30:02 self-employment income all your income is taxable with self-employment with a self-employment tax
02:30:08 even if you are under the threshold that can't even if you're under the threshold if it's
02:30:12 self-employment tax you still get tax that doesn't mean that's crazy it's like oh like the self-employment
02:30:18 tax is like applied after the the deductions you're made and like it doesn't matter if you if you
02:30:26 you you get you get taxed on like all of your income including the stuff that is under the like
02:30:32 deduction oh you know the like the via the generalized deduction yeah yeah that like 1400 or
02:30:38 whatever the fuck it is it is 12 is 1200 in in my state anyway yeah yeah yeah so like my my overall
02:30:44 income minus expenses was well under that threshold but it because it wasn't zero it all got taxed
02:30:51 under the stuff it was fucking well okay i don't i don't get it it's like it's like 15 fucking percent
02:30:56 i thought it was more i mean i remember looking up like i put away 25 of all my income specifically
02:31:03 or all my all my online because of my my job like already gets taxed uh i put it i just put it away
02:31:09 for tax paying so i'm i'm happy if i pay extra or if i put away too much fantastic couldn't be
02:31:14 happier that's just extra money i'll save i mean i do i save most of my money like it's not like i
02:31:20 had spent it all and i had nothing you didn't pull a digi yeah i like yeah like i yeah i could pay it
02:31:26 but boy did it hurt um so yeah that's me out i didn't i did not real i did not realize that
02:31:34 i did not realize it worked that way i thought oh i'm gonna be under the threshold i'm gonna be
02:31:37 fine i probably won't have anything wrong wrong last year okay last year because i didn't
02:31:45 technically get yeah i made less overall and also the um the kickstarter like i did not get
02:31:52 the kickstarter payout until january so that was not so i did i did pay a little last year but it was
02:31:58 it was a lot less um i mean you think that that kickstarter income like that should all get eaten
02:32:05 up because like it's all goes to expenses and maybe there's some leftover as like income but like
02:32:10 you know ideally you'd think that it works that way but not not all of it yeah i mean not not all
02:32:15 of it and anything that wasn't um anything that wasn't eaten up with expenses i mean just a similar
02:32:21 example like the radcon three like that money came in like this year and like that was income in my
02:32:26 name so i put that on my taxes and stuff but like all the money got distributed to you guys and got
02:32:31 eaten up with stuff so like none of us made a profit at all which you know was fine but like so
02:32:35 theoretically like you'd think i wouldn't get taxed on that uh and i hope that's how it works out but
02:32:40 i guess we'll see if if it's if it's all if it all goes to expenses then it all gets deducted from
02:32:46 your taxable income i think is at least how it's i'd imagine so i mean i think so okay anyway all
02:32:52 right let's move on uh uh uh uh uh okay message from racism the only race i care about is nascar
02:32:59 okay go okay okay think about this nascar like the cars they they turn left i think that's the
02:33:06 direction they go because it's like a circle and they just go fucking left every time and left is
02:33:11 politics and uh nascar is propaganda thanks ted talk that that was my ted talk fuck you
02:33:20 you i think slovo zizek would love to hear you should uh you should write about all politics
02:33:26 in eva louis benz left like nascar you guys yeah but we got it we got it you know nascar is doing

02:35:08 getting like legit i started getting dizzy because it's like just the caffeine
02:35:12 yeah yeah well there might be other stuff but mostly it's just okay okay uh all right next one
02:35:18 this is from voicemail anon i think there's like a public service announcement one okay go all right
02:35:23 so every episode you play the voicemails people send in and some of them are really great like
02:35:33 the them snakes skates voicemails yeah for example yeah them snakes i would like to listen to them again
02:35:42 if i could find them but i can't find them and i i know they exist on some uh fucking sound cloud
02:35:52 but i can't find this fucking sound cloud and i i know it exists because i've seen it before
02:35:59 like some a long time ago but i can't find it now i've gone through my google history and
02:36:06 everything all right so my question to you okay where's the voicemails guys hashtag where's the
02:36:15 voicemails yes good okay good there is only unlike the question of where's the podcast this
02:36:22 question actually has an answer i believe it does okay so i look this up ahead of time so it's sound
02:36:27 cloud dot com slash the dash pro dash crastonators those aren't underscores those are dashes and also
02:36:34 it'll be in the show notes although i thought it was in the fucking is it not in the general links
02:36:39 i guess i guess it must not be uh okay it's going to be in the show notes soundcloud.com
02:36:43 forward slash the dash pro dash crastonators that's the soundcloud but i also brought this up because
02:36:49 there's there's there's a thing going on um the soundcloud is full and so i'm being forced to week
02:36:55 by week delete old weeks voicemails to make room like we could pay for like a pro account and keep
02:37:03 them or something but like this one's free and that's pretty great so i'm i'm all about that uh
02:37:09 so we are losing history the voicemails are in the show they are the voicemails are they're all
02:37:13 embedded so like there's not much being lost so like i thought i don't i don't see i don't see
02:37:17 preservation as a problem okay i'm glad i'm glad to hear you say that because i was i was wondering
02:37:21 if anyone's concerned by that but uh okay great that guy felt like he was about he was like on the

02:42:24 he actually had script uh i've got a spoiler for you it wasn't intentional i don't know man there's a
02:42:31 lot there's a lot of thought clearly put into these there's there's this deep it's it's really
02:42:36 run deep uh and the attention to detail like that is what elevates it about that that's true you
02:42:40 know he doesn't resort to gimmicks like a piano solo or a voice monitor it's just pure quality pure
02:42:45 storytelling just the raw the pure pathos yes everyone the immersion he's you know what he's

02:43:18 i'm gonna have to shoot you again like i shot batman you know just on accident quote unquote yeah
02:43:23 don't worry about it it's fine it's good okay uh we've got one last fucking thing to do oh my god
02:43:30 there's one more and this one's got free today yeah well this one's simply called yo nate it's called
02:43:35 yo nate uh sure let's see what he's got ready and go you all got a question for me uh is your girl
02:43:42 retarded because you look like that for nico they would take advantage of a handcuff bitch and she
02:43:48 looks retarded please what i literally could not understand i literally could not understand the word
02:43:57 of that uh so he was asking if michelle's retarded correct yeah i mean i think you're the kind of
02:44:07 person who had data retarded first so okay so in this indecipherable accident he calls up and
02:44:15 he's just like hey buddy you know what is your girlfriend retarded just just thought that would
02:44:18 be in character anyway see ya for the first time ever i think i need to hear that one more time
02:44:22 for clarity's sake we're gonna repeat this one yeah yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna really okay so editor uh
02:44:28 listen up prick up those ears and splice that shit in okay here we go and go you all got a question
02:44:33 for me uh is your girl retarded because you look like that for nico they would take advantage of a
02:44:39 handcuff bitch and she looks retarded it was like you look like the kind you look like the kind of nigger
02:44:53 who would take advantage of that kind of bitch i believe and he says and also she looks retarded
02:45:02 okay i believe that's what would said um well it takes another waiting we're waiting for your
02:45:10 answer wait what was the question again like would i no no no is she retarded is she retarded
02:45:16 simply post so so what uh you know i mean i really think retardation is a spectrum and is first of
02:45:22 all yeah second of all it's in the eye of the beholder uh it's a social construct uh these
02:45:27 things can't be defined by modern day language uh you gotta understand the context there's the
02:45:31 there's an odd spectrum of retardation spectrum the cut the cut yeah you gotta take all these
02:45:35 factors seriously okay we want a steel man here so so let's take let's take his argument and
02:45:40 struggle okay good so so so here is what he's pausing she he's asking you if your girlfriend
02:45:46 is retarded right here is the evidence you look like the kind of nigger that would take advantage
02:45:51 of that kind of bitch and secondly she looks retarded okay well okay so let's and let's
02:45:56 analyze both of these arguments you look like the kind of nigger that would take advantage of that
02:46:02 kind of bitch that's right do we think this is accurate because i okay well let's okay aesthetically
02:46:07 like visually definitely 100 yeah definitely a lot of goodwill from this man so i'm i'm inclined to
02:46:12 to you know take give him a lot of leverage in this debate in this yeah you know so that
02:46:19 definitely checks out definitely think i mean you know my my my my answer my answer i am that kind
02:46:25 of nigger that's all i can say that's that's really all there is to say uh and and secondly uh she
02:46:30 looks retarded yeah i mean it's guilty is charged ladies and gentlemen i mean there's no there's no
02:46:35 getting away from that one uh check out both of those i mean i think we just have to conclude
02:46:41 i mean after presenting his argument as best we could i think he's just he's got a point here i
02:46:44 think he's just unequivocally correct and that's all there is to say one more time i beg you one
02:46:51 one more you know what all right let's hear this one more time for the road ladies and gentlemen
02:46:54 all right this is this is the surprise sleeper hey yo nate the the little known uh wonderful
02:47:00 you know voicemail maker okay one more time here we go go you got a question for me uh
02:47:06 is your girl retarded because you look like that for nigger they would take advantage of
02:47:10 fucking cow bitch and she looks retarded please handicap type a nigger who'd take advantage of
