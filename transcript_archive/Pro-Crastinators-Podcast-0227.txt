00:00:00 Hey, it's The Pro Crastinators Podcast again.
00:00:09 I can't believe it's been again so soon.
00:00:13 I can't believe we didn't get canceled after all that racist shit we said on the last episode
00:00:20 that they let us make another one.
00:00:21 Oh, they said that was exactly why we're getting renewed for now.
00:00:25 They brought me back on.
00:00:26 They had to drag me back out to be the radical centrist to keep you in check.
00:00:31 Sorry.
00:00:32 Whichever one of the Koch brothers is still alive smokes his cigar and was like, ah, these
00:00:36 boys are exactly what we need.
00:00:39 Give these guys a billion dollars.
00:00:42 So we're going to fire Eleazar and we're going to have a whole team of corporate editors.
00:00:50 We're going to have real production.
00:00:51 Now the podcast is really dead.
00:00:53 We're going to have a real podcast soon.
00:00:56 Oh, what a week.
00:01:00 What a week.
00:01:01 Right off the bat.
00:01:02 I'll tell you what I'm excited about.
00:01:04 The Vapors 2 books, they are in the mail and I'm looking at the tracking numbers and
00:01:12 they are like just like a couple hours ago.
00:01:15 They made their way.
00:01:17 They had left Florida.
00:01:18 They have arrived in Massachusetts.
00:01:20 And so I'm assuming they will be.
00:01:22 They will be in my grasp.
00:01:24 Maybe tomorrow.
00:01:25 I don't know.
00:01:26 I don't know.
00:01:27 It's coming.
00:01:28 It's coming.
00:01:29 It's been so long.
00:01:30 I forgot to even spend money on it.
00:01:31 I've been writing, right?
00:01:32 Right.
00:01:33 Everyone who spent money on it is going to have forgotten.
00:01:34 You couldn't.
00:01:35 You could have just pocketed all the cash.
00:01:37 Damn.
00:01:38 Fuck.
00:01:39 It's going to be they're going to forgot that they spent however much they spent.
00:01:45 It's going to be they're going to get it like for free.
00:01:47 It's like they're just going to be getting a free present from me like they didn't even
00:01:49 pay for it at all.
00:01:50 Yeah.
00:01:51 I looked at the thing and I completely forgot that one of the stretch goals was like the
00:01:54 Ben St. Heart pin.
00:01:55 I didn't realize I forgot I was getting that.
00:01:58 Yeah.
00:01:59 Everybody gets that.
00:02:00 Everybody gets that.
00:02:01 And everybody gets a dollar.
00:02:02 Oh my God.
00:02:04 Everybody gets one dollar with class war and a hammer and sickle.
00:02:08 I'm going to frame that as my first dollar that like literally like actually.
00:02:14 Incredible.
00:02:15 My first communist dollar.
00:02:17 It'll be for me.
00:02:18 Yeah.
00:02:19 Vapors to Kickstarter achieve full communism and all it cost was $10,000.
00:02:23 I wonder how much it costs for America.
00:02:28 Only Stalin had known that communism was that cheap.
00:02:32 Damn.
00:02:35 There was a.
00:02:36 All right.
00:02:38 Right in.
00:02:39 Right in with the politics.
00:02:40 I saw a great video.
00:02:41 Actually, I'll just I was doing.
00:02:43 I was doing my my my Patreon podcast this week.
00:02:47 This month.
00:02:48 I was terrible.
00:02:49 Don't listen to it.
00:02:50 Do not.
00:02:51 I repeat.
00:02:52 Do not pledge at patreon.com and listen to the latest episode.
00:02:57 It was bad.
00:02:58 I am ashamed of myself.
00:03:00 But in the comments, Janess, who was at Radcon, we met her at the meetup, she left a comment
00:03:09 and she told me about this video called it's fuck it's called like responding to every
00:03:17 yes.
00:03:18 Yeah.
00:03:19 Oh yeah.
00:03:20 You commented on Twitter.
00:03:21 You comment.
00:03:22 Yeah.
00:03:23 We're like answering every like criticism of communism or whatever.
00:03:24 And it is.
00:03:25 It's just a video where he goes through like all these different arguments that you hear
00:03:28 all the time and just kind of like, you know, does a little debunking of each one each
00:03:32 one.
00:03:33 It's really good.
00:03:34 It's really good.
00:03:35 The guy's channel is called spooky scary socialist.
00:03:39 It apparently took him two years to make this video because it's like 45 minutes of like
00:03:44 his little like puppet avatar, like fully animated with like mouth movements, like explaining
00:03:49 it.
00:03:50 What a fool.
00:03:51 Yeah.
00:03:52 For real.
00:03:53 What?
00:03:54 Wait.
00:03:55 Like a stop motion puppet or a hand?
00:03:56 No, like like a flash.
00:03:57 No.
00:03:58 Like a flash puppet.
00:03:59 A flash puppet.
00:04:00 Oh, right.
00:04:01 Yeah.
00:04:02 Yeah.
00:04:03 It's not like well drawn or anything.
00:04:04 That's the whole thing.
00:04:05 Very meticulous.
00:04:06 It was wasted effort.
00:04:07 It was very much wasted effort.
00:04:09 But at the same time, I like it.
00:04:11 I like how I like watching it talk, but at the same time, it wasn't it probably wasn't
00:04:15 worth two years.
00:04:16 Exactly.
00:04:17 When he could have just voiced it.
00:04:18 He could have just put it over a static image and it would have been fine.
00:04:21 During those those two years, VTubers have become a thing and have completely made that
00:04:26 production pipeline bloated and silly by comparison.
00:04:30 You just got to get live 2D and have it do all the automated keyframes for you.
00:04:34 Oh my God, you're right.
00:04:35 You should have just pitched up his voice made a cute little anime waifu that have a
00:04:38 million views right now.
00:04:39 I should get live 2D.
00:04:41 They don't even need like good lip syncing.
00:04:43 No, they don't.
00:04:44 Wait, should I get live 2D?
00:04:48 I think everybody should.
00:04:50 I was trying.
00:04:51 The inevitable end game for all of us.
00:04:54 VTubers are the downfall of society.
00:04:56 If I can like live 2D like version of punk, but it was too complex and I ran out of time.
00:05:03 I wanted to do it for like my like draw streams in August, but it was too much work to do.
00:05:10 You have like a 3D model of punk from the game, right?
00:05:14 I do.
00:05:15 Were you trying to use that?
00:05:16 I try to convert it.
00:05:19 Well, live 2D, you start with a drawing.
00:05:22 You start with a drawing and you make it like a puppet.
00:05:25 You make it a puppet.
00:05:26 But the 3D stuff, it's absolutely abysmal, terrible, horrible.
00:05:32 Very complicated.
00:05:33 I needed to convert it to some other program and open it in that program so that I could export it as something else from that program.
00:05:39 And the list of like the tutorial list was so long and convoluted that I killed myself and I'm dead now.
00:05:46 Wow.
00:05:48 Well done.
00:05:50 But I will do that.
00:05:51 I do want to do that like a little punk, like while I'm drawing or whatever.
00:05:55 I have a webcam, but like it's punk there or some other character.
00:05:59 One of them.
00:06:00 Any of them.
00:06:02 Pretty cool.
00:06:03 A gun girl.
00:06:05 Could you like stream and maybe you have like a little like discord chat window open and someone else on like a webcam
00:06:15 whose face is like controlling the punk puppet and like they like play punk through this model.
00:06:22 And it's like the two of you can have a little like back and forth.
00:06:25 I don't know.
00:06:26 I'm coming up with this on the fly.
00:06:28 So like I'm drawing.
00:06:29 I'm on the cutting edge.
00:06:30 I'm drawing.
00:06:31 You're drawing and your webcam is showing you but then like over here is punk who some other person who you are in a discord call with
00:06:37 is moving and puppeting them with their face.
00:06:43 Pretty cool.
00:06:44 Some advanced technology.
00:06:46 Pretty freaking cool.
00:06:48 The real reason you would get a Vtuber avatar is so that you don't have to show your face.
00:06:53 That's what I would do.
00:06:55 Well that's boring.
00:06:56 Why stop there?
00:06:58 Why do the most obvious thing?
00:07:00 We've already been exposed.
00:07:02 There's no there's no saving us now.
00:07:04 We might as well just go.
00:07:06 The only Vtuber I like is the bunny girl in the made outfit with the big titties.
00:07:12 Which one?
00:07:14 No there's one.
00:07:16 There's like there's the dog girl.
00:07:18 No there's the bunny girl in the blue.
00:07:21 There's the bunny girl in the blue.
00:07:23 I don't know single one of them.
00:07:24 She's special.
00:07:25 Well I just saw a gif of her.
00:07:27 I just saw a gif of her holding a giant carrot.
00:07:30 It was pretty cool.
00:07:32 She's special.
00:07:33 She's my waifu.
00:07:35 Nobody else is on the entire internet.
00:07:37 That's right.
00:07:39 That's correct.
00:07:41 She's like rabbit from Winnie the Pooh.
00:07:43 Who I thought was a girl growing up.
00:07:45 And I had a huge crush on first orgasm I ever had.
00:07:49 Jacking off to rabbit from Winnie the Pooh.
00:07:51 Is that true?
00:07:53 No.
00:07:55 I mean I would be surprised really.
00:07:57 I did think rabbit was a girl.
00:07:59 Ben's gendered enough to make that to be true.
00:08:01 That's believable to me.
00:08:03 I thought rabbit was a girl because he had because he gardened a lull.
00:08:07 But I still didn't think he was hot.
00:08:09 Think of all the progress Ben's made.
00:08:11 The fucking communist man he is now before he enforced such strict gender stereotypes.
00:08:17 He thought rabbit was a girl.
00:08:19 Only women are involved in agriculture.
00:08:23 Rabbit wore a fucking apron.
00:08:27 Yeah.
00:08:29 I think his character is an effeminate man that does things that women are supposed to do.
00:08:37 He acts like a mom in the one with the bird.
00:08:41 I forget the one with Kessie.
00:08:43 Yeah.
00:08:45 He nags like a woman.
00:08:47 All the signifiers are there.
00:08:51 I think rabbit might be trans guys.
00:08:53 Oh.
00:08:55 Which way?
00:08:57 I don't know.
00:08:59 Time to watch a new cartoon and talk about it with a little avatar in the corner.
00:09:02 Time to make a really long YouTube video.
00:09:06 Go through all the problems of making a live 2D puppet and then just make knockoff mysterious Mr. Enter videos with it.
00:09:13 Just have like a sans eye Winnie the Pooh OC and he sans eye Winnie the Pooh.
00:09:21 What?
00:09:23 When he's got the blue glow in his eye.
00:09:25 I know what you mean.
00:09:27 Winnie the Pooh.
00:09:29 Cause you gotta have a Winnie the Pooh Sona.
00:09:31 It's too powerful for this one.
00:09:33 What's your Pooh Sona guys?
00:09:35 Hey guys.
00:09:37 So I've made this new the Winnie the Pooh 100 acre wood tabletop RPG.
00:09:42 You gotta pick your race.
00:09:44 You're either a stuffed animal or a real animal.
00:09:46 The two have different bonuses and malices against each other.
00:09:50 They deal different damage types.
00:09:52 It's like a rock, paper, scissors type thing but there's only two of them.
00:09:57 So you know.
00:09:59 One is just better than the other.
00:10:02 Yeah.
00:10:04 What about human children?
00:10:06 Is that the third one?
00:10:09 Like human child beats the shit out of stuffed animal.
00:10:13 Well it's like Kyogre and Groudon.
00:10:15 Real animal kills child and then stuffed animal forces the real animal to choke when it eats it.
00:10:23 It's like Kyogre and Groudon and Christopher Robin is like Rayquaza.
00:10:27 I know what that means.
00:10:29 That makes sense.
00:10:31 He flies up in the sky?
00:10:33 Yeah and he's got airlock.
00:10:35 He's probably flying above the sky because he's a real person.
00:10:38 And he has something that the toys can never have.
00:10:41 And at the end you climb on his back and ride him into space.
00:10:45 You know?
00:10:47 Yeah, I remember that happening in the show all the time.
00:10:49 So it checks out.
00:10:53 You gotta climb up the Eore Hill and watch the clouds do their crazy aurora thing.
00:10:58 And you just take off and you gotta come on, come on Piglet.
00:11:03 Oh Piglet, we gotta catch fucking deoxys.
00:11:05 There's a meteor headed towards us.
00:11:08 We gotta catch it.
00:11:10 His defense is really low.
00:11:12 Piglet, I hope you learn false swipe.
00:11:17 That all makes a lot of sense to me anyway.
00:11:20 That all checks out.
00:11:22 Yeah, yeah, you know.
00:11:24 That's the sort of like...
00:11:27 Bringing that back.
00:11:29 Long time viewers might remember that.
00:11:32 I don't.
00:11:33 How far did you get?
00:11:35 How far did you get in Winnie the Pooh's grand slam or whatever?
00:11:38 Oh, not very far.
00:11:40 I think I got to Tigger.
00:11:42 It was just who was like the third guy.
00:11:45 I got like halfway through.
00:11:49 But I started to tap out when it actually started to get tough.
00:11:53 Like Rabbit was like, yeah, I could deal with Rabbit, but then...
00:11:57 Since I've played all of the Dark Souls series since that episode,
00:12:00 I can confirm that game is harder than Dark Souls.
00:12:03 Not to me, definitely true.
00:12:05 Yeah, I think...
00:12:07 I don't know, there comes a point when it's like,
00:12:10 you have to be like pixel fucking perfect.
00:12:14 And I just could not read the pitches at all.
00:12:19 I had no idea what was happening.
00:12:21 Now it bested me.
00:12:25 And I've beaten like Super Meat Boy,
00:12:27 and I've beaten all kinds of hard games and shit.
00:12:31 I beat Downwell.
00:12:33 Downwell's kind of hard.
00:12:35 It's not that hard.
00:12:36 I can't beat Downwell.
00:12:38 I always get unlucky.
00:12:42 The way to win Downwell is just to use Floaty.
00:12:45 My strategy is use Floaty,
00:12:48 hope for early knife and fork,
00:12:52 and just increase your max health.
00:12:55 But you can go the other way too,
00:12:57 where you just go full on hyper offensive,
00:13:00 kill everything before they have a chance to damage you style,
00:13:03 which also works, LeMau.
00:13:09 Yeah, video games.
00:13:11 I love video games.
00:13:13 You know, I've got some video game thing to talk about.
00:13:16 Maybe, I don't know...
00:13:18 Have either of you played World of Warcraft ever?
00:13:21 I played a little bit of Cat of back when it came out,
00:13:23 and that's it.
00:13:24 I played...
00:13:26 I fully leveled up a character one summer
00:13:30 when Wrath of the Lich King was new.
00:13:32 Cool.
00:13:33 And that was it.
00:13:34 I didn't do much raiding or anything.
00:13:36 Yeah, I've been...
00:13:39 Since they announced like a year ago,
00:13:43 or a number of months ago,
00:13:45 World of Warcraft classic servers are now a thing,
00:13:49 which recreate the world before the Cataclysm.
00:13:53 I remember when that was coming out,
00:13:56 a bunch of my roommates were talking about it,
00:13:59 because all my roommates used to play World of Warcraft.
00:14:03 The reason I played it that one summer was because a bunch of them,
00:14:07 who I went to college with, were like,
00:14:08 hey, Wrath of the Lich King coming up,
00:14:10 Ben, you should play.
00:14:11 You should play with us.
00:14:12 And I was like, okay.
00:14:13 I didn't end up getting that into it.
00:14:15 Have I ever mentioned that the people I live with,
00:14:19 or a bunch of them anyway,
00:14:21 a bunch of the people that I met,
00:14:23 and the way that I got this place that I live in right now,
00:14:27 they were a bunch of people who came from this forum
00:14:31 that it was called the TLDR,
00:14:35 and it was for people who were banned from the World of Warcraft forums.
00:14:40 No.
00:14:41 Yeah.
00:14:42 This is like the click of people who congealed around this house.
00:14:46 Incredible.
00:14:47 Yeah, there were these bunch of miscreants
00:14:51 who were banned from the Warcraft forums
00:14:53 and formed their own forum.
00:14:55 What did they say?
00:14:56 Did they say nasty words?
00:14:58 I don't know.
00:15:00 I got to imagine that there's as many different reasons
00:15:03 for having been banned from the World of Warcraft forums
00:15:06 as there are stars in the sky.
00:15:09 Well, yes.
00:15:10 Anyway, I just thought that was a nice anecdote I would share.
00:15:15 So, World of Warcraft, I was a big World of Warcraft freak
00:15:21 in my early university days,
00:15:25 or maybe, no, it was before university,
00:15:28 but it was like end of school,
00:15:30 and I was playing it all summer like a big loser.
00:15:34 But then, there's been a number of expansions.
00:15:37 Wrath of the Lich King was really big and hype,
00:15:40 and everybody loved it,
00:15:41 and it was like snowy, like Mordor,
00:15:44 you know, like cool, epic.
00:15:46 That was the cool time,
00:15:48 and then the expansion that came out afterwards
00:15:50 was the Cataclysm,
00:15:52 and it changed a lot of the level 1 to 60 content
00:15:55 in Azeroth permanently.
00:15:58 And I have hated the game slowly,
00:16:01 ever since that point,
00:16:02 because they just ruined so much about the things I liked.
00:16:06 And I'm going back now to World of Warcraft Classic
00:16:09 because they finally said,
00:16:10 fine, we'll let you have the thing you've been asking us
00:16:13 for ever since Cataclysm.
00:16:15 We'll finally let you buy this thing,
00:16:18 and I've been playing it.
00:16:20 Generous of them.
00:16:21 Well, it's so funny,
00:16:22 because they were on record, on stage,
00:16:24 someone asked them a couple years ago,
00:16:26 can you release Classic,
00:16:28 and they're like,
00:16:29 no, you guys think you know what you want,
00:16:31 you don't.
00:16:32 Yeah, it's been so annoying the years.
00:16:36 Ever since Cataclysm,
00:16:37 I played it once,
00:16:39 obviously because it was new,
00:16:40 and it was like,
00:16:41 wow, a giant dragon called Deathwing
00:16:44 burned everything.
00:16:45 That's pretty cool.
00:16:46 I play all the new content.
00:16:47 I see all the new quests,
00:16:48 and I had previously played
00:16:50 and seen every other prequest
00:16:54 before the world changed.
00:16:55 So I knew everything.
00:16:56 I knew all the differences.
00:16:59 The biggest difference was
00:17:01 they made it far more convenient
00:17:04 to the detriment of absolutely everything
00:17:07 that made Water Warcraft good.
00:17:09 It was so much about...
00:17:11 They did that to the Classic.
00:17:13 Yeah, they did it.
00:17:14 It's been slowly over the expansions,
00:17:18 because the level cap raises every time.
00:17:20 They need to make it possible
00:17:24 for a new player to get to the highest level
00:17:27 in a timely fashion.
00:17:28 So the amount of experience
00:17:30 you need to gain lowers slightly.
00:17:32 But with Cataclysm,
00:17:33 they redid all the old quests
00:17:35 to make them fundamentally more streamlined.
00:17:38 You go into a place,
00:17:39 and all of the quests
00:17:41 send you out into a small area
00:17:43 near the Quest Hub.
00:17:45 You do the quests,
00:17:46 you come back to the Quest Hub,
00:17:47 and they lead you on to the next area.
00:17:49 And you go through the entire zone
00:17:51 like a theme park ride, almost.
00:17:53 You never really need to think.
00:17:55 You never explore.
00:17:56 You just go on the track that they provide.
00:17:58 And you can technically not do that.
00:18:00 You can technically not do any of the quests.
00:18:02 It's just like,
00:18:04 there's no content if you do that.
00:18:07 So they turned it into a theme park
00:18:10 that sucks and is boring.
00:18:11 It's fine the first time,
00:18:12 but once you've seen it,
00:18:14 there's no joy in exploring the world anymore.
00:18:17 So I've been stewing about this,
00:18:19 and especially how they said,
00:18:21 you don't know what you want.
00:18:22 It takes so much longer to level up in Classic
00:18:25 in vanilla Warcraft.
00:18:27 It takes so long to level up,
00:18:29 and it's difficult,
00:18:31 and you don't want that.
00:18:33 I'm pretty sure.
00:18:35 I liked leveling up.
00:18:37 I had fun with the game when I was leveling up
00:18:39 and exploring the world,
00:18:41 and then when it got time to start raiding,
00:18:43 I was like, I hate this.
00:18:44 It's awful.
00:18:45 I've never been into raiding.
00:18:46 It was not fun.
00:18:48 The whole thing with raiding
00:18:50 is that it completely becomes
00:18:54 the multiplayer aspect
00:18:56 is the high level.
00:18:57 The world is what I like,
00:18:59 and I always liked the architecture,
00:19:02 the big chunky bone buildings
00:19:07 that the orcs use.
00:19:09 How could a bone be that big
00:19:11 that they make a tent out of it?
00:19:13 What creature could have made this bone?
00:19:15 Never explained, but it's great.
00:19:19 Just the visuals were my favorite part of playing.
00:19:21 That was like that.
00:19:23 PS2 was something that really got me
00:19:25 into low poly and stuff,
00:19:27 because I grew up with it, obviously,
00:19:29 but going back and playing wow,
00:19:31 and being able to really stop and examine everything
00:19:33 and trying to figure out how everything was made
00:19:35 was so fucking cool,
00:19:37 and that was one of the big catalysts
00:19:39 that made me think, I want to do this.
00:19:41 It was just the way they crafted everything.
00:19:43 Everything was all boxy,
00:19:45 but there was a lot of artistic flair to it.
00:19:47 Oh, it was such a good design.
00:19:50 Beautiful.
00:19:52 You said, Tom, you played
00:19:54 when Cataclysm came out.
00:19:56 All the quests were super fucking boring
00:19:58 and dumb, and I hated it.
00:20:00 It's not like
00:20:02 War of Warcraft Classic was like
00:20:04 the quests were way more interesting.
00:20:06 It's just that
00:20:08 the slowness of
00:20:10 the progression
00:20:12 and things like
00:20:16 the mounts cost
00:20:18 like untold amounts of gold
00:20:20 in the early game.
00:20:22 And now in the new games,
00:20:24 they're really cheap and you can get them,
00:20:26 and if you have one mount and one character,
00:20:28 you don't need to get them for a new character.
00:20:30 My greatest wish
00:20:32 when I played
00:20:34 was just to level up.
00:20:36 All I wanted was to level up
00:20:38 my fucking clothsmanship
00:20:40 or my tailoring skill
00:20:42 enough to make the flying carpet.
00:20:44 It took me so long,
00:20:46 I was like, I can't believe it.
00:20:48 I can't believe I have my flying carpet now.
00:20:50 This is the greatest day of my young life.
00:20:52 Yeah, I mean,
00:20:54 War of Warcraft high-level content still,
00:20:56 each expansion they have, all that stuff.
00:20:58 Cataclysm is really just a sticking point
00:21:00 because it removed
00:21:02 well-structured quests that were designed
00:21:04 for the zone that was built
00:21:06 around them and
00:21:08 replaced them with a shitty
00:21:10 theme park that is really dated
00:21:12 compared to all of the other content.
00:21:14 It just
00:21:16 sucks a lot.
00:21:18 I would make a big analysis video
00:21:20 comparing every single quest
00:21:22 and saying, this one's bad, this one's good.
00:21:26 Old, yeah, new bad old good.
00:21:28 Yeah, old good.
00:21:30 And I've just
00:21:32 loved playing.
00:21:34 I didn't mention this,
00:21:36 but the reason I got back into War of Warcraft,
00:21:38 because I know it's really addictive,
00:21:40 is like
00:21:42 a treat to myself
00:21:44 for having done the Clarissa
00:21:46 Tezuka thing, so I'm like,
00:21:48 I'm gonna play a video game and I'm gonna let myself
00:21:50 enjoy video game.
00:21:52 And I played it and I'm
00:21:54 it's just
00:21:56 mind-boggling.
00:21:58 How much better
00:22:00 designed
00:22:02 the pacing of the game
00:22:04 is when it's slow, when you're just walking around
00:22:06 because you have your quest log,
00:22:08 you actually have to read the quest
00:22:10 and listen, like, read
00:22:12 where the guy says to go,
00:22:14 and it doesn't tell you on the map.
00:22:16 You just have to know, like,
00:22:18 okay, head south and then
00:22:20 do east when you get to the bridge.
00:22:22 And then if you think about that, like, okay, that's there
00:22:24 on the map, I can go
00:22:26 that way and do that quest all on its own,
00:22:28 but there's two quests to the north.
00:22:30 I should probably do those first because it'll be quicker
00:22:32 and I can loop back around
00:22:34 to this point. It's like this strategy,
00:22:36 because of the slowness,
00:22:38 you want to use your time efficiently.
00:22:40 And it's just
00:22:42 a far more engaging experience
00:22:44 than just sort of walking to the guy who has
00:22:46 the exclamation point
00:22:48 and looking at the minimap to see where the enemy
00:22:50 is and just clicking on them.
00:22:52 I've probably said this before.
00:22:54 Yeah, I remember
00:22:56 just having a good time
00:22:58 just, like, running around Azeroth.
00:23:00 I got my raptor.
00:23:02 Oh, man, I bought my first raptor. Fuck yeah.
00:23:04 Time to run across the barons or whatever.
00:23:06 Oh, there's some mountains. Like, can I climb those?
00:23:08 Like, fuck yeah.
00:23:10 I love the baron's mountains the best.
00:23:12 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:23:14 And, you know,
00:23:16 I want that flying carpet.
00:23:18 Oh, it's going to take me so long.
00:23:20 It's going to take me so much gold to train up all these skills.
00:23:22 Oh, flying carpet though. It's okay. I'll put in the work.
00:23:26 Oh, fuck. Oh, no.
00:23:28 I had a point I was going to make.
00:23:30 Oh, and I was going to say that I had the same thing
00:23:32 in Final Fantasy XI.
00:23:34 Was 11 the online one or was it 12?
00:23:36 I think it may have been, yeah, 12.
00:23:38 12 was the offline one.
00:23:40 11 was the online one.
00:23:42 Okay, yeah, yeah. The first online one.
00:23:44 They, um,
00:23:46 yeah, when I was like, I got bored.
00:23:48 I got bored, like, doing local.
00:23:50 I couldn't really figure out the quest system because I was like a stupid kid
00:23:52 and I never played a fucking MMORPG before.
00:23:54 And I was like, well, I guess I just go kill monsters.
00:23:56 Like, this is boring.
00:23:58 I don't want to fuck with the multiplayer.
00:24:00 Like, oh, god, making, like, guilds
00:24:02 and, like, joining groups, like, that seems really complicated.
00:24:04 I was just going to, like, walk into the wilderness
00:24:06 and I just, like, walked across the entire world
00:24:08 and I got murdered by, like,
00:24:10 over-leveled monsters in every area.
00:24:12 But I was like, I'll just find my way around them.
00:24:14 Just squeeze my way around things
00:24:16 so I don't die and get to
00:24:18 go across the continent and just, like, yeah, I made it.
00:24:20 Okay, cool. I'm done with the game
00:24:22 and I'll play it again.
00:24:24 I got everything out of it that I wanted.
00:24:26 I do love shit like that.
00:24:28 There's been multiple times
00:24:30 in World of Warcraft
00:24:32 where it's just sort of,
00:24:34 especially the first few times I played it
00:24:36 on a, like, a new character.
00:24:38 I'm like, I'm going to explore, like, at a low level
00:24:40 and I'm going to go into a place I'm not supposed to be.
00:24:42 If I stick to the road,
00:24:44 maybe the wolves won't jump at me
00:24:46 from, like, 40 feet away and kill me in one hit.
00:24:48 Maybe they won't do that,
00:24:50 but they still do.
00:24:52 But you can, you know, you get your ghost,
00:24:54 you walk back to your body, you move a little,
00:24:56 like, a couple feet forward
00:24:58 and then you die again and you keep doing that
00:25:00 until you get to a safe place and then you're, like,
00:25:02 level one in, like, the really high level zone
00:25:04 place and people look at you and they're like,
00:25:06 whoa, what the fuck?
00:25:08 They point at you and they say,
00:25:10 lol, out loud.
00:25:12 Now you can die really fast.
00:25:14 It's just great.
00:25:16 It's the world of Warcraft.
00:25:18 The Warcraft sucks.
00:25:20 Like, gameplay is, like, okay,
00:25:22 but the world is great.
00:25:24 It's a real fun place to be.
00:25:26 I feel like that was the entire point from the beginning, right?
00:25:28 To take this, like,
00:25:30 game that's, like, a real-time strategy game
00:25:32 that, like, pulls you so far out
00:25:34 from, like, the actual, like,
00:25:36 events and, like, environments
00:25:38 and then drops you in this one individual
00:25:40 and now it's all around you, this thing that, like,
00:25:42 traditionally you saw from such, like, a high
00:25:44 angle, now you're in it.
00:25:46 That must have been the selling point initially
00:25:48 and I think it just kind of got lost
00:25:50 in its own, like, meta game
00:25:52 and now that's what, like, Blizzard makes it for.
00:25:54 Like, trying to, like, build around, like,
00:25:56 the end-level content for, like,
00:25:58 addicted players to keep them continuing to
00:26:00 give them $15 a month for another decade
00:26:02 as opposed to, like,
00:26:04 building up that world.
00:26:06 I don't know.
00:26:08 They have made some pretty interesting things,
00:26:10 but, like, largely
00:26:12 it's just more of the same.
00:26:14 It looks a little different
00:26:16 and it's addictive and there's
00:26:18 lots of numbers and lots of, like,
00:26:20 things you can complete.
00:26:22 There's lots of achievements, like, oh, do one
00:26:24 thousand of these. Oh,
00:26:26 I would like to do one thousand of those, but that'll take
00:26:28 a long time. Ha-ha, Blizzard
00:26:30 rubs their hands. I've got to get
00:26:32 their money now. They're gonna
00:26:34 spend money more.
00:26:36 I hate it when those big money men
00:26:38 rub their hands together and smoke their
00:26:40 cigars and go, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh,
00:26:42 nyeh, money please.
00:26:44 And I willingly hand it over because
00:26:46 they have my video game.
00:26:48 Damn you, Bobby Kotick, you got me again.
00:26:50 If only he didn't own the means of production.
00:26:52 Ah, fuck, here you go.
00:26:54 Don Nuts.
00:26:56 Oh, yeah.
00:26:58 Nah, shucks.
00:27:00 I only bought three months, but
00:27:02 I'm probably gonna want to play it more than that,
00:27:04 but I am only playing it, only
00:27:06 playing it on the weekends,
00:27:08 on Wednesday, and after streaming,
00:27:10 which is still quite a lot.
00:27:12 I mean, I'm gonna try it to be
00:27:14 like a good boy and not like a good girl.
00:27:16 I don't know, fuck genders.
00:27:18 It's too hard.
00:27:20 Ah, you killed yourself just there.
00:27:22 Ah, you fucking killed it.
00:27:24 Ah, call the fucking gender police
00:27:26 on this fucking...
00:27:28 The gender police, like the vegan police
00:27:30 from Scott Pilgrim.
00:27:32 You used the wrong pronoun.
00:27:34 You're gonna get disintegrated.
00:27:36 If you...
00:27:38 I don't know, something, something,
00:27:40 if you look in the mirror and you
00:27:42 explode, I don't know, whatever.
00:27:44 Shut up.
00:27:46 Hey, shut the hell up.
00:27:48 Shut up, self, the one who brought up this joke.
00:27:50 Hey, shut up. I want to hear what you were saying.
00:27:52 Keep going.
00:27:54 I think I was done with the World of Warcraft stuff.
00:27:56 I just really like it.
00:27:58 It's really nice.
00:28:00 I recommend World of Warcraft Classic
00:28:02 and
00:28:04 running around in the Barons
00:28:06 and Molochor.
00:28:08 I watched, I watched
00:28:10 Folding Ideas video
00:28:12 on the World of Warcraft
00:28:14 Classic
00:28:16 and I was like, okay.
00:28:18 He had some
00:28:20 opinions about it and I was like, okay.
00:28:22 Why did you say that you watched
00:28:24 a video and didn't...
00:28:26 I don't know what the video was.
00:28:28 It was just
00:28:30 him talking about World of Warcraft Classic.
00:28:32 And he said
00:28:34 this is what it's like, and I said
00:28:36 okay.
00:28:38 Well, I just told you what it's like.
00:28:40 Yeah, but
00:28:42 I thought I'd mention that somebody else
00:28:44 also told me.
00:28:46 Aw.
00:28:48 I thought I was going to build a career
00:28:50 off of this.
00:28:52 I thought I was the only one.
00:28:54 The only one who's like
00:28:56 thought to talk about it.
00:28:58 Oh no.
00:29:00 Everyone else is just suffering in silence.
00:29:02 Thinking that they're not allowed to talk
00:29:04 about it, but they can.
00:29:08 You're going to be the whistleblower.
00:29:10 You're going to blow the whistle on this whole
00:29:12 thing. Bring this whole house of cards
00:29:14 tumbling down.
00:29:16 Not today.
00:29:20 Sad.
00:29:24 Alright.
00:29:26 I got a thing.
00:29:28 I got a thing from this morning.
00:29:30 Early this morning.
00:29:32 I've been up all night.
00:29:36 I got annoyed. I got an argument
00:29:38 on my Discord server.
00:29:40 I'm not going to name any names or anything.
00:29:42 That's not the point.
00:29:44 The point is this was a thing that annoyed me.
00:29:46 I guess this is like an MI the asshole
00:29:48 kind of thing.
00:29:50 Here it is.
00:29:52 There's this tweet that's going around.
00:29:54 It's got these four girls.
00:29:56 It's like, oh, these are like
00:29:58 four lefty politics girls
00:30:00 who like guns
00:30:02 and whatever.
00:30:04 And they're hot.
00:30:06 They're leftists.
00:30:08 And what do you think about that world?
00:30:10 The squad.
00:30:12 It's like, okay, fine.
00:30:14 And I do think
00:30:16 that three of them are pretty hot.
00:30:18 And the fourth one
00:30:20 is also conventionally attractive.
00:30:22 But I
00:30:24 don't like her face.
00:30:26 Honestly, I think her face
00:30:30 I think there's several unattractive things about her,
00:30:32 but in particular it's her face. I don't like it.
00:30:34 When I see it,
00:30:36 it's like, I think it's gross.
00:30:38 And I
00:30:40 it's not important why.
00:30:42 It's not important why, but I'm like,
00:30:44 so I go on my discord and I'm like, I can't stand
00:30:46 seeing this tweet anymore.
00:30:48 I have to say
00:30:50 this girl who's like, oh,
00:30:52 these girls are so hot. I'm like, this one's hideous.
00:30:54 This one's disgusting. I hate them.
00:30:56 I didn't say I hate them,
00:30:58 but I was like, they're hideous.
00:31:00 They're awful looking.
00:31:02 Just one of them.
00:31:04 One in particular.
00:31:06 Who I feel like
00:31:08 the whole like, am I the asshole?
00:31:10 Like when you say that,
00:31:12 it seems pretty clear that you are.
00:31:14 I don't know.
00:31:16 I felt like I was re I feel like it's reasonable
00:31:18 if you have to ask the question
00:31:20 you're you already have the answer.
00:31:22 I feel like it's
00:31:24 I feel like it's reasonable
00:31:26 to say
00:31:28 I think this person's ugly.
00:31:30 Not even to them.
00:31:32 It's subjective, right?
00:31:34 How can we really say objectively
00:31:36 if you're correct or not?
00:31:38 I think, all right,
00:31:40 there was a whole hubbub in your discord
00:31:42 and I skinned it.
00:31:44 I got the gist,
00:31:46 I think.
00:31:48 So it's like turned into a thing because
00:31:50 we kind of just cut you off.
00:31:52 There was kind of a longer here.
00:31:54 Just for reference, I will show you the image
00:31:56 and I will say that I think
00:31:58 is very unattractive.
00:32:00 I am not. I do not like
00:32:02 her appear. I do.
00:32:04 I do not find myself excited by the appearance.
00:32:06 In fact, I see it and I want to
00:32:08 leave.
00:32:10 Absolutely have the same skirt.
00:32:12 I mean, you'd have to ask them
00:32:14 if somebody's going to have to change the thing about it is
00:32:18 the thing about it is the one that I the one that I don't
00:32:20 that I don't like the look of
00:32:22 is one that I followed because
00:32:24 I liked their tweets. I like the things that they wrote
00:32:26 and said.
00:32:28 But seeing them,
00:32:30 I'm like, I hate it.
00:32:32 I hate seeing this
00:32:34 and I don't want to see them anymore
00:32:36 because they're that ugly to me
00:32:38 and so I unfollowed them because I'm like,
00:32:40 I like, I feel like
00:32:42 a girl like this is probably
00:32:44 has made the joke before. It's like, I hope you're all
00:32:46 following me for my political opinions.
00:32:48 I'm not my breasts or whatever.
00:32:50 And you know, it's probably like,
00:32:52 everyone's just following me for my breasts
00:32:54 for my face, for my
00:32:56 because I post naked pictures of myself
00:32:58 and all that shit.
00:33:00 But you know, I have these political opinions
00:33:02 and I hope I'm being respected for those too.
00:33:04 But for me, I like their tweets
00:33:06 and I hate how they look.
00:33:08 And I think there's probably some irony in that.
00:33:10 I don't know.
00:33:12 Man, I said, I was
00:33:14 I was pretty rude. I was pretty rude about how they look,
00:33:16 but like, I don't know.
00:33:18 So what?
00:33:20 It's not like they're going to see it.
00:33:22 The reason there was a hubbub in
00:33:24 the in your discord when you posted
00:33:26 all that is not because
00:33:28 you know, they're arguing
00:33:30 that she, you know, if she heard
00:33:32 what you said, she would be upset.
00:33:34 It's just that it looks
00:33:36 weird and feels weird
00:33:38 to have someone
00:33:40 just come in and say, isn't this bitch
00:33:42 ugly? I didn't call her a bitch.
00:33:44 You didn't call her a bitch, but like, it's
00:33:46 that vibe, you know, and people will be like,
00:33:48 I
00:33:50 don't know.
00:33:52 I don't really want to be, I don't really want to be,
00:33:54 you know, discussing whether or not a person is ugly
00:33:56 or not.
00:33:58 And it's just sort of like, they didn't
00:34:00 understand why you had this
00:34:02 opinion. It's just a weird thing to say.
00:34:04 I don't know.
00:34:06 Because like, is there
00:34:08 something, is there like one,
00:34:10 I don't think there's anything wrong with thinking someone
00:34:12 is extremely
00:34:14 unattractive. Well, yeah.
00:34:16 And that being said, I don't think there's anything wrong
00:34:18 with saying so. If it's okay to think
00:34:20 it, I feel like it should be okay to say it
00:34:22 in a context that's not like
00:34:24 harassment, which it wasn't.
00:34:26 Right. Is your contention
00:34:28 simply that the tweet
00:34:30 is presenting this person as like
00:34:32 one of four very attractive people
00:34:34 and you don't see it there and you're merely asking
00:34:36 the question? Well, the reason why
00:34:38 yeah, I mean
00:34:40 the reason why I had this feeling
00:34:42 it's like, I kept seeing it and being like,
00:34:44 I don't agree. This is like
00:34:46 clearly the prevailing opinion
00:34:48 is that these four are all
00:34:50 attractive and to me
00:34:52 it's like, but I really don't like how that one
00:34:54 looks. I don't like looking at them. I literally
00:34:56 unfollow them because
00:34:58 they're repugnance. That seems so
00:35:00 unusual.
00:35:02 That's like, huh? Like, am I
00:35:04 the only one? I'm unique. I'm different.
00:35:06 I'm the alternative
00:35:08 man. Well, I am.
00:35:10 Well, I fucking am though.
00:35:12 I clearly
00:35:14 do not in the majority
00:35:16 on this question.
00:35:18 Yeah, I mean, I don't particularly find her
00:35:20 attractive either.
00:35:22 Okay, but a lot of
00:35:24 people do. Right.
00:35:26 Clearly.
00:35:28 And I don't know.
00:35:30 So what if I'm like
00:35:32 well, hey, I disagree
00:35:34 not even on like a fucking platform.
00:35:36 I think it was entirely a vibe thing.
00:35:40 To criticize someone's opinion
00:35:42 it's like, ooh, what did they say?
00:35:44 There's some intrigue there. To criticize someone's
00:35:46 looks
00:35:48 is just sort of like a dead end
00:35:50 and then, I don't know
00:35:52 it gets
00:35:54 people's cogs turning as to why you would
00:35:56 bring that up
00:35:58 and then they come up with like some
00:36:00 conclusions and they're like, Ben, are you like
00:36:02 a misogynist or something?
00:36:04 Or like, what's going on here?
00:36:06 And then you're like, you have to defend yourself
00:36:08 and then it's like, it gets heated
00:36:10 because like
00:36:12 the reason like, yes, you don't need to
00:36:14 find people attractive and
00:36:16 isn't it interesting that this person
00:36:18 who everyone thinks is attractive, I don't think is attractive?
00:36:20 I'm, you know
00:36:22 I don't know. It's just sort of
00:36:24 I see why there was a big storm
00:36:26 but I don't think there's really anything to talk about
00:36:28 with it.
00:36:30 Well, I'm sorry to waste your time.
00:36:32 No, I'm not wasting
00:36:34 you're not wasting time right now.
00:36:36 I'm just, I'm just
00:36:38 I don't know.
00:36:40 I don't know.
00:36:42 I just really hate, I just really hate
00:36:44 how she looks. I hate it.
00:36:46 I do. I feel that strong about it.
00:36:48 I'm sorry.
00:36:50 It's irritating.
00:36:52 Because it partially
00:36:54 to a large extent it's not
00:36:56 necessarily like
00:36:58 what she's shaped like.
00:37:00 It's like the face that she makes
00:37:02 which to some extent is like a choice.
00:37:04 It's like an affect that she's putting on.
00:37:06 There's something about the way
00:37:08 the way that she's communicating with me
00:37:10 through the facial expression she makes
00:37:12 which rubs me the wrong way
00:37:14 and pisses me off.
00:37:16 That's not the entire, that's not the entire thing
00:37:18 but that's part of it.
00:37:20 I just don't like
00:37:22 it doesn't really affect my thoughts
00:37:24 how or why exactly
00:37:26 you dislike her face.
00:37:28 Right. Cause I don't know
00:37:30 how I don't have the same reaction
00:37:32 and there's really just nothing for me to say about it.
00:37:34 I feel like that's the reason
00:37:36 that there was
00:37:38 discourse because it's like
00:37:40 what does everyone say to this? I don't know.
00:37:42 Well now I'm embarrassed because
00:37:44 if anyone in my discord
00:37:46 who is listening to this will be like
00:37:48 oh I was there for that haha man
00:37:50 that really got under Ben's skin haha
00:37:52 rent free LeMau
00:37:54 and I don't know
00:37:56 you're right. Correct.
00:38:00 That's it.
00:38:02 Again.
00:38:04 Well okay then
00:38:06 mission accomplished I guess.
00:38:08 I'm sorry
00:38:10 I apologize
00:38:12 for wasting everyone's time with that.
00:38:16 LeMau
00:38:18 All right here's
00:38:20 I got um
00:38:22 actually I'm gonna do an announcement actually
00:38:24 I'm gonna do an announcement for a brand new thing
00:38:26 that has been cooking
00:38:28 over on
00:38:30 a brand new discord
00:38:32 Whoa what?
00:38:34 Doon Koon
00:38:36 member of the pro and on
00:38:38 cast and fan of
00:38:40 the PCP allegedly
00:38:42 quote unquote
00:38:44 I was in my stream
00:38:46 talking about stuff talking about boobies
00:38:48 haha that's what I like doing haha
00:38:50 haha I was talking about
00:38:52 big boobies and mummy milkers and that was
00:38:54 you know it was a pretty funny idea
00:38:56 it was pretty epic it sounds like an epic time
00:38:58 it's like a podcast like the big boobie mummy milkers
00:39:00 and I tweeted it as well
00:39:02 and then people said are you a big boobie
00:39:04 or a mummy milker
00:39:06 and this sort of spread into
00:39:08 like an idea was planted
00:39:10 at Doon Koon's head
00:39:12 and she
00:39:14 she's going by she for the moment
00:39:16 she decided to make
00:39:18 a clone of endless war
00:39:20 where it was
00:39:22 but boobs instead
00:39:24 because the endless war source code
00:39:26 is just available so you can take it
00:39:28 you can edit it and now
00:39:30 there is a brand new text based
00:39:32 mmo that you can play right now
00:39:34 in your discord browser called
00:39:36 big boobies mummy milkers
00:39:38 haha
00:39:40 you go on you go
00:39:42 into the server you can
00:39:44 wait is do you get milk
00:39:46 no you get breast size
00:39:48 so here's how it works
00:39:50 here's how it works you go
00:39:52 you go in you have to
00:39:54 drag in the list into a big boobie
00:39:56 a big boobie or mummy milker
00:39:58 a faction
00:40:00 factions are exactly the same
00:40:02 there's no difference at all
00:40:04 and then
00:40:06 oh wait no it's not
00:40:08 there's not no difference because the big boobies
00:40:10 can jiggle
00:40:12 like exclamation point jiggle
00:40:14 and the mummy milkers can
00:40:16 exclamation point squirt
00:40:18 and you know
00:40:20 understandable
00:40:22 I'm with you so far
00:40:24 then you have to go to the titty bar
00:40:26 and you have to exclamation point squeeze
00:40:28 to gain breast size
00:40:30 I don't really know
00:40:32 squeeze what
00:40:34 you go to the titty bar and you squeeze titties
00:40:36 your own
00:40:38 I don't you know it doesn't make any sense
00:40:40 but it's just mining with reskin
00:40:42 so instead of getting slim you get breast size
00:40:44 you could check your size
00:40:46 exclamation point size
00:40:48 and you think your breast size is a number
00:40:50 it just keeps getting bigger
00:40:52 okay sure
00:40:54 every so often you get a
00:40:56 mutation I mean fetish
00:40:58 and you get fetishes
00:41:00 for squeezing
00:41:02 sometimes you do
00:41:04 all of the stuff that
00:41:06 is like in endless war in mining
00:41:08 has been turned into a boob thing
00:41:10 so
00:41:12 occasionally you will find an extra large boob
00:41:14 and you will squeeze it and you get more
00:41:16 boob size from that
00:41:18 other times it will be like
00:41:20 boob minesweeper
00:41:22 where you have to decide which
00:41:24 it's a
00:41:26 there's like a very difficult to unhook bra
00:41:28 and you have to use the coordinates
00:41:30 like minesweeper
00:41:32 to get it
00:41:34 to open it
00:41:36 it's booby themed endless war it's called endless expansion
00:41:38 big boobies mummy milkers
00:41:40 it's free and open and you can join it
00:41:42 and there's boobs
00:41:44 in it
00:41:46 you can post images
00:41:48 wait a minute
00:41:50 and there's boobs in it
00:41:52 there's boobs in it
00:41:54 no shit
00:41:56 I'm so glad that endless war has finally
00:41:58 experienced the
00:42:00 staple of all open source software
00:42:02 which is pointless ridiculous forking
00:42:04 it's finally happened
00:42:06 yo that's fucking based
00:42:08 yo pop that discord
00:42:10 link in the description
00:42:12 I will
00:42:14 not open like as we're recording it
00:42:16 but it will be open like in a day
00:42:18 so I will do it then
00:42:20 then how do you know any of this
00:42:22 cause I've been in there testing it
00:42:24 man on the inside
00:42:26 I am the big boober
00:42:28 duncun is the mummy milker
00:42:30 we're taking over endless war
00:42:32 everybody's gonna say
00:42:34 ever since munchie left endless war
00:42:36 sucks I'm gonna go to big boobies mummy milkers instead
00:42:40 duncun just wants to take everything
00:42:42 just wants to take everything we've got
00:42:44 first
00:42:46 the pcp
00:42:48 superseded by the pro and on cast
00:42:50 and now endless war
00:42:52 obliterated by endless expansion
00:42:54 big boobies mummy milkers
00:42:56 I can see it now
00:42:58 can't we have anything
00:43:00 not with this kind of performance
00:43:02 well I can I have like a
00:43:04 50% stake in the big boobies mummy milkers franchise
00:43:06 I'm taking you down
00:43:08 with all of us
00:43:10 it goes down together
00:43:12 yeah yeah yeah
00:43:14 you fucking
00:43:16 no fuck
00:43:18 shit no
00:43:20 well
00:43:22 sad
00:43:24 you know in titanic if jack had big boobies
00:43:26 he would be alright
00:43:28 they probably would have kept him warm too
00:43:32 maybe we solve all the problems in the world
00:43:34 that's just what I think
00:43:36 yeah
00:43:38 so yeah
00:43:40 go there right now
00:43:42 subscribe in list
00:43:44 like, comment, subscribe

00:43:50 squirt
00:43:52 and like and subscribe
00:43:54 it's exclamation point
00:43:56 and not exclamation
00:43:58 question mark
00:44:00 did I say exclamation point every time
00:44:02 it's question mark
00:44:04 like gib being like that's my symbol
00:44:06 from like pony
00:44:08 alright that's debts deep lore
00:44:10 yeah
00:44:12 that's way down on the pcp lore iceberg
00:44:14 actually it's probably not
00:44:16 that's probably like second or third level
00:44:18 yeah
00:44:20 I've been thinking about a pcp
00:44:22 iceberg thing I think somebody did make one
00:44:24 they did
00:44:26 a long time ago
00:44:28 in the last rfck contest
00:44:30 I think it was
00:44:32 vintage
00:44:34 no fuck
00:44:36 oh god
00:44:38 the shy guy
00:44:40 he starts with a v
00:44:42 oh no I feel so stupid
00:44:44 yeah venice
00:44:46 made the iceberg chart
00:44:48 which was
00:44:50 we spent a long time
00:44:52 going over it
00:44:54 even me and munchie didn't know
00:44:56 some of the things on there
00:44:58 but we also thought that some of them were weirdly placed
00:45:00 and we had a good round of discussion
00:45:02 I would move this here
00:45:04 and I would move that there
00:45:06 wait is this what I think it is
00:45:08 what else would be on this level
00:45:10 on this level
00:45:12 those things are fun
00:45:14 it was a rousing good time
00:45:16 a rousing
00:45:18 it was a rousing good time
00:45:20 oh yes
00:45:22 oh yes
00:45:24 what about the pcp one
00:45:26 I don't know
00:45:28 I was just going to say
00:45:30 I could think of a few
00:45:32 pretty deep
00:45:34 how deep do you think the sly 2
00:45:36 pcp secret episode is
00:45:38 wait
00:45:40 the sly 2
00:45:42 is that
00:45:44 it's a secret pcp episode that happened in a
00:45:46 call when I was playing sly 2
00:45:48 and I uploaded it
00:45:50 it's so secret I don't even know that
00:45:52 I don't know about this
00:45:54 this is a deep shit
00:45:56 when I was in the pcp chat
00:45:58 I was recording a lets play
00:46:00 or streaming or something
00:46:02 I think I was streaming
00:46:04 and then people funneled in
00:46:06 I think digi was first
00:46:08 and it became a pcp episode
00:46:10 like unofficial
00:46:12 I don't remember this
00:46:14 but it sounds like something that would happen
00:46:16 people are going to go look for that now
00:46:18 sounds pretty cool
00:46:20 people are going to go look for that
00:46:22 and relive the glory days
00:46:24 wow
00:46:26 I guess that would be pretty
00:46:28 deep then
00:46:34 I'm trying to think of something
00:46:36 but even that is
00:46:38 something that is on the internet
00:46:42 and some people were probably
00:46:44 there for it and saw it and remember it
00:46:46 I'm trying to think of something that no one would know
00:46:48 my innermost fear
00:46:50 yeah
00:46:52 or like
00:46:54 maybe some throw away detail
00:46:56 from some
00:46:58 radcon1 vlog or something
00:47:00 I don't know
00:47:02 I think to qualify it does have to be
00:47:04 like posted somewhere
00:47:06 yeah
00:47:08 they wouldn't have known about it
00:47:10 unless it was posted or at least streamed
00:47:16 the thing with those things is
00:47:18 obviously we're involved with the pcp
00:47:20 we know everything that we were in
00:47:22 or at least we were there
00:47:24 when it happened
00:47:26 but the viewers
00:47:28 not every viewer of
00:47:30 the procrastinators watches
00:47:32 or listens to every single episode
00:47:34 and every single related video
00:47:36 of all of our stuff
00:47:38 can you imagine
00:47:40 it's feasible that
00:47:42 something has only been seen by
00:47:44 60 people or is remembered
00:47:46 by 60 people and maybe got 100 views
00:47:48 it's just a stupid little vlog
00:47:50 but in it is a secret moment
00:47:52 that those like
00:47:54 few can remember
00:47:58 probably I've forgotten as well
00:48:00 I don't remember what happened
00:48:02 back then
00:48:06 I don't even remember what happened
00:48:08 do you remember
00:48:10 do you remember when it was
00:48:12 radcon2
00:48:14 and Davoo went around asking everybody
00:48:16 their opinion on Undertale
00:48:18 after it had been out for a year
00:48:22 I remember the video
00:48:24 I don't think he asked me
00:48:26 but I remember the video
00:48:30 oh for sure
00:48:32 oh there's things I filmed
00:48:34 there's things I filmed at radcon1
00:48:36 that I never made into a video
00:48:40 there's like
00:48:42 an image or two
00:48:44 that was posted
00:48:46 during the time that was being filmed
00:48:50 but I didn't do anything
00:48:52 with the footage
00:48:54 I was going to use it for something
00:48:58 because when I had like my
00:49:00 penguin mask and my green screen suit
00:49:02 and I was crawling through
00:49:04 the Digi's house
00:49:06 attic
00:49:08 like towards the camera
00:49:10 I was going to be spooky
00:49:12 I don't
00:49:14 I have trouble remembering
00:49:16 what happened at radcon1 vs radcon2
00:49:20 the way to remember
00:49:22 is that radcon1
00:49:24 was only a few of us
00:49:26 radcon2 had Jeff
00:49:28 Munchy
00:49:30 and Tom were you at radcon1
00:49:32 I was not at radcon1
00:49:34 I was at radcon2 though
00:49:36 wait so who was at radcon1
00:49:38 that was like right when I moved in
00:49:40 with digi right so I must have been there
00:49:42 you were the
00:49:44 dvoo was dvoo there
00:49:46 I believe dvoo was there
00:49:48 in radcon1
00:49:50 I think so
00:49:52 yeah you guys were there around the same time
00:49:54 so it was dvoo, digi
00:49:56 it was Nate, Ben, me, digi and Jesse
00:50:02 I think I was the only one who really wasn't there
00:50:04 and mage obviously
00:50:06 and Munchy
00:50:08 I didn't know at the time
00:50:10 whether he was officially on the PCP
00:50:12 ooo yeah I don't know
00:50:14 because radcon1 and radcon2
00:50:16 happened like a few months after each other
00:50:18 radcon2016 was like
00:50:20 autumn or winter
00:50:22 of 2016
00:50:24 wait okay
00:50:26 this is gonna
00:50:28 this is probably gonna be really annoying
00:50:30 to someone who's listening and knows all this
00:50:32 I can't believe these guys don't remember
00:50:34 their own fucking lives but whatever
00:50:36 because
00:50:38 Munchy joined the PCP
00:50:40 after monkey did
00:50:42 and monkey was not a member during radcon1
00:50:44 and 2
00:50:46 but munchy appeared
00:50:48 it was at radcon2 so like
00:50:50 what's up with that
00:50:52 munchy was at radcon2
00:50:54 do you not remember get the pizza now
00:50:56 wait no that was radcon3
00:50:58 I remember he was there but was he not a member
00:51:00 he was at that point I believe so
00:51:02 that's why he was there
00:51:04 I think Jeff was there
00:51:06 yeah Jeff was there
00:51:08 munchy was not
00:51:10 am I wrong did munchy join after munchy
00:51:12 munchy joined after munchy
00:51:14 and they were very close
00:51:16 similar at the same time
00:51:18 but only by a few months I think it was just
00:51:20 after radcon2
00:51:22 that munchy went to Digi's house
00:51:24 and they did let's plays or something
00:51:26 and then after that
00:51:28 but he wasn't in the PCP yet
00:51:30 he just was adjacent
00:51:34 okay
00:51:36 oh wait Jesse, Jesse was at radcon1
00:51:38 or just 2
00:51:40 yeah he was at radcon2 and 1
00:51:42 and 1 okay
00:51:44 the things that
00:51:46 I don't believe in the weeb
00:51:48 was that
00:51:50 I do remember believe in the weeb that was radcon2
00:51:52 that was definitely radcon2
00:51:54 what even the fuck was radcon1
00:51:56 I remember we had Digi had
00:51:58 like the
00:52:00 3 dimensional 360 camera
00:52:02 and they wanted to try it out
00:52:04 yeah
00:52:06 and we had a PCP recorded like that
00:52:08 radcon1
00:52:10 was it was just like
00:52:12 it was basically just like
00:52:14 Ben and DeVoo are moving in
00:52:16 just like anyone who
00:52:18 wants to should just come
00:52:20 and hang out for a while right
00:52:22 that seemed like a general premise yeah
00:52:24 yeah yeah the first
00:52:26 radcon was like what if we didn't go to bronycon
00:52:28 and then the second radcon was
00:52:30 let's try and fund
00:52:32 another one
00:52:34 by doing this thing no the second one was
00:52:36 by accident like we're doing the plebe and the weeb
00:52:38 but we could also fund another radcon
00:52:40 and then the third one was like everyone should
00:52:42 just come for that anyway
00:52:44 the third radcon was like actually the first
00:52:46 like funded radcon to happen
00:52:48 yeah yeah
00:52:50 radcon3 was when like
00:52:52 the concept of radcon really
00:52:54 solidified I think
00:52:56 um
00:52:58 like yeah before that it was all just like
00:53:00 well we're doing this other thing so why
00:53:02 not
00:53:04 all just get together and I don't know
00:53:06 whatever happens happens lol
00:53:08 and then we had um we had like
00:53:10 was it like radcon3 and a half
00:53:12 or whatever at like did you
00:53:14 place in Boston yeah that was
00:53:16 yeah
00:53:18 I recall yeah I came
00:53:20 because everyone was going there and I was like
00:53:22 I don't want to miss out so I got a little plane
00:53:24 take it and I flew over
00:53:26 um it was fun seeing everyone
00:53:28 no it was it was fun
00:53:30 we just sort of hung out in the room and went
00:53:32 to eat a couple times
00:53:34 yeah I went out with munchie
00:53:36 and
00:53:38 got Chinese buffet and it was
00:53:40 cold outside I remember
00:53:42 very little and we played pokemon go
00:53:44 or something did we
00:53:46 did we go eat in like Chinatown
00:53:48 or something I think we did
00:53:50 ikon was the I think
00:53:52 appeared for a little while
00:53:54 unless I'm thinking of some other time
00:53:56 wait was that the time with the stinky tofu
00:53:58 it may have been
00:54:00 I think it might have been yeah
00:54:02 no no
00:54:04 no maybe
00:54:06 there was a lot of like small gatherings around that
00:54:08 time and then
00:54:10 culminated with radcon 3.5
00:54:12 I don't remember if that was the time with the
00:54:14 stinky tofu or if it was when
00:54:16 I came up from Georgia
00:54:18 with ikon
00:54:20 and then we got that fucking stinky tofu
00:54:22 oh yeah it was it was definitely when you came
00:54:24 up because you were telling the story of the stinky
00:54:26 tofu when we went to that
00:54:28 same Chinese place again
00:54:30 during radcon 3.5
00:54:32 wait but
00:54:34 no no no but
00:54:36 whatever it was called that was
00:54:38 before I came back up
00:54:40 from no was I living
00:54:42 in Massachusetts again for that
00:54:44 oh okay I got him switched I got him
00:54:46 switched okay
00:54:48 because that was when we had Nate come up
00:54:50 and everything because we were talking about
00:54:52 where did you was going to move and if Nate was
00:54:54 going to move with them and there was a whole
00:54:56 had that big long sit down we were talking about
00:54:58 Tulsa versus wherever the fuck
00:55:00 and it led literally nowhere
00:55:02 imagine
00:55:04 oh that sucks that whole thing
00:55:06 sucks there was no there was no
00:55:08 point to it it was a long conversation
00:55:10 that was very circular and
00:55:12 not much headway was made unfortunately
00:55:14 I think I just left to go
00:55:16 and like
00:55:18 steal
00:55:20 the cock cast girls avocado
00:55:22 and maybe get drunk I don't remember
00:55:24 oh yeah they had a
00:55:26 thing they did a thing down there
00:55:28 yeah there's a whole separate podcast going on
00:55:30 downstairs while we were upstairs
00:55:34 it was better it was better down there
00:55:36 I got really mad at Jack
00:55:38 Jack 3 sucked and I played it and I hated it
00:55:42 no Jack 3 is good because you can nuke the whole city
00:55:44 Jack 3 is bad because it's too linear
00:55:48 you have to do all the missions in order
00:55:50 and you can't explore anything it sucks
00:55:52 yeah but you can make the missile
00:55:54 that goes
00:55:56 and everyone turns into like a grease
00:55:58 mirror on the ground
00:56:00 yeah but that's way later it's not fun to
00:56:02 like speedrun into that point you have to do
00:56:04 so much bullshit before you can actually have fun
00:56:08 fine
00:56:10 fine there's a fine line
00:56:12 just take this from me
00:56:14 just take this from me I have so little
00:56:16 and now I have nothing
00:56:18 gee why did you give it to me
00:56:20 I don't know
00:56:22 can I have it back please
00:56:24 nah nah too late
00:56:26 but okay I'm sorry
00:56:28 furtive ben
00:56:30 furtive little ben so easily
00:56:32 crushed under my boot

00:57:04 but I was um
00:57:06 the books are gonna be here and I'm a figure in
00:57:08 like might as well get ready for that so I've been addressing
00:57:10 envelopes I have like so many
00:57:12 uh fucking
00:57:14 I addressed 300 envelopes
00:57:16 and I think it might have been a waste because
00:57:18 like there were like 300 and change
00:57:20 people who like made orders
00:57:22 uh so I
00:57:24 there were like 330 or something
00:57:26 and so I addressed 300
00:57:28 thinking like okay
00:57:30 probably there will be a few people who don't like
00:57:32 reply to the survey and maybe like even
00:57:34 a couple that like forget that they ordered maybe
00:57:36 you know I can't get it to them but like
00:57:38 you know I'll have 300
00:57:40 will be like plenty but like
00:57:42 less than like like only like
00:57:44 160 have like actually replied
00:57:46 so I might be left with like all these address
00:57:48 envelopes so like if anyone's

00:58:24 secret knowledge
00:58:26 we'll be abused later for sure
00:58:30 her name's kind of cool actually but I won't say it
00:58:32 out of out of respect and
00:58:34 and honor and Bushido
00:58:44 I should have done Nate's envelope but Nate didn't
00:58:46 actually answer the survey he just like sent
00:58:48 me a message saying like
00:58:50 this is my address I don't know why he did
00:58:52 that but he did so
00:58:54 I gotta do his too
00:58:56 but anyway I was
00:58:58 I was doing all these envelopes and it took me like you know
00:59:00 it took me a long time well I'm very meticulous
00:59:02 took me like
00:59:04 a couple days like several hours work each day
00:59:06 to get it all done
00:59:08 so I was like so I put on a movie
00:59:10 and I put on this old movie
00:59:12 that I had heard of before someone
00:59:14 I was I was watching a youtuber
00:59:16 called Jose who does these long
00:59:18 videos about like
00:59:20 old sitcoms like 90s sitcoms
00:59:22 sort of like breaking that he did
00:59:24 he's one about Roseanne he was about
00:59:26 married with children he has one about
00:59:28 uh
00:59:30 there's another one whatever and I really
00:59:32 like these videos and
00:59:34 he I was listening to the married with children
00:59:36 one and he he's talking
00:59:38 about one episode and where like two
00:59:40 couples like argue and he compares
00:59:42 to this movie
00:59:44 who's afraid of Virginia Woolf and I had
00:59:46 heard of that movie but I didn't know what it was about
00:59:48 but he compared it to this episode of
00:59:50 married with children and I was like
00:59:52 what would a movie that's just about like
00:59:54 two couples just sort of
00:59:56 like interact like talking to each other
00:59:58 about stuff be like and I went
01:00:00 and I watched it and it was great
01:00:02 it's a great fucking little
01:00:04 screenplay and it has
01:00:06 awoken in me a desire
01:00:08 for more movies where nothing happens
01:00:10 um and just people talk about
01:00:12 stuff uh because I really
01:00:14 like I really liked that I really
01:00:16 like who's afraid of Virginia Woolf I really like
01:00:18 12 angry men I really liked
01:00:20 my dinner with Andre only there was more media
01:00:22 available where people just talked and nothing
01:00:24 happened if only people could easily create
01:00:26 those things
01:00:28 if only there were so there were yeah
01:00:30 hmm where could I find this untapped market there
01:00:32 just waiting I'm sure who
01:00:34 knows who knows
01:00:36 but I made I made a tweet earlier being like
01:00:38 recommend me recommend me
01:00:40 more shit we're just like
01:00:42 nothing happens and it's just about people
01:00:44 talking about stuff because I like
01:00:46 it and I've gotten quite a few
01:00:48 uh Twitter recommendations so
01:00:50 maybe I will go and look into some of those
01:00:52 uh soon
01:00:54 um soon
01:00:56 dairy who's afraid of Virginia Woolf
01:00:58 was it real I was I was gripped
01:01:00 I was very I was gripped the whole
01:01:02 way through I was like
01:01:04 haha haha what are they gonna say
01:01:06 it was I was glued to the screen
01:01:08 but not really because I was
01:01:10 just listening I was mostly
01:01:12 listening but I still completely understood
01:01:14 what was going on it's like you know is it
01:01:16 is it old old like
01:01:18 ah see I'm from the old
01:01:20 times and I talk like this it's not
01:01:22 that all that's this from the 60s

01:01:28 the the
01:01:30 uh everyone everyone
01:01:32 is drunk the whole movie
01:01:34 and like watching the movie made me feel
01:01:36 drunk which made me happy
01:01:38 haha
01:01:40 it was it was it was intoxicating
01:01:42 in quite ways
01:01:44 than one yes yes
01:01:46 um now it was that was
01:01:48 probably the highlight of my week uh
01:01:50 to be honest
01:01:52 sad I know
01:01:54 actually no why is that
01:01:56 that's not sad a good you find a good
01:01:58 oh I really like a film that I really like
01:02:00 yeah that's yeah that's the highlight of my week and I'm not ashamed
01:02:02 yeah yeah nowadays like
01:02:04 the normal media
01:02:06 uh like
01:02:08 potato chip food that you
01:02:10 eat is like I saw a funny
01:02:12 meme on Twitter the day oh
01:02:14 oh oh
01:02:16 kill me now like like watching
01:02:18 a real actual thing that people
01:02:20 put effort into is is a good
01:02:22 nobody does it I don't do it
01:02:24 nearly enough I mean
01:02:26 I love
01:02:28 long
01:02:30 boring YouTube videos
01:02:32 like the one I do like the ones
01:02:34 about that I just the hose ones
01:02:36 about sitcoms I
01:02:38 will watch every fucking uh
01:02:40 summoning salts like history
01:02:42 of a speed run video
01:02:44 and like other channels that do the same
01:02:46 thing I'll just put that shit on auto
01:02:48 play and just let it go
01:02:50 um I am I can
01:02:52 talk about Bill and Ted
01:02:54 yeah that sort of stuff
01:02:56 I like it too but I also
01:02:58 don't like it I know that I don't like
01:03:00 it because I don't remember it
01:03:02 there's a occasionally I remember a video
01:03:04 and be like god that was a really interesting video
01:03:06 I want to watch it again sometimes
01:03:08 it's good some sometimes
01:03:10 like I'll put something like that on and be like okay
01:03:12 this will be on while I work and then I'll get
01:03:14 work done and it's like yeah cool
01:03:16 and other times I'll be like I'll put this on
01:03:18 while I work and then I'll get distracted
01:03:20 or I'll be a few but you know
01:03:22 maybe that's not the video's fault
01:03:24 right like maybe it doesn't I was just
01:03:26 didn't wasn't feeling focused that day
01:03:28 and and I would have gotten distracted
01:03:30 by something
01:03:32 do you do you always I guess it's just
01:03:34 kind of part of my workflow now
01:03:36 do you structure your days in any
01:03:38 fashion do you like have like
01:03:40 work days and like relaxed days
01:03:42 no
01:03:44 because that's how I
01:03:46 I feel like it's a good way to get over
01:03:48 the the random
01:03:50 not being able to focus
01:03:52 is allowing yourself to do
01:03:54 whatever you want
01:03:56 to relax and not work specifically
01:03:58 not to work on some days
01:04:00 so that other days are more like
01:04:02 you wake up and you know what you're supposed to do
01:04:04 even if
01:04:06 even if like it's like a creative
01:04:08 thing and you're setting this wrecking
01:04:10 your brain like how do I do this
01:04:12 and you don't get a lot done it's still
01:04:14 like better than
01:04:16 getting distracted and watching some
01:04:18 YouTube videos I feel
01:04:20 every day is a work day
01:04:22 unless I have plans
01:04:24 which is rare but occasionally
01:04:26 happens and then that's a
01:04:28 not work day
01:04:30 but then it's like okay well
01:04:32 every day is technically a work day
01:04:34 but I don't actually
01:04:36 work on every
01:04:38 quote unquote work day because
01:04:40 I feel like every day
01:04:42 well yeah I mean that's exactly why
01:04:44 I like structure them
01:04:46 to be like not everywhere
01:04:48 every day is a work day because if every day
01:04:50 is a work day for me at least
01:04:52 um it causes me
01:04:54 like
01:04:56 to do work
01:04:58 really badly where I don't
01:05:00 build up any momentum and I just feel bad
01:05:02 that I hadn't done enough work on all the
01:05:04 days instead of feeling good
01:05:06 that I did a lot of work on like two of the
01:05:08 days
01:05:10 yeah
01:05:12 because there's that thing where you build up momentum
01:05:14 you start work which is the hard part
01:05:16 and then if you're still working for hours
01:05:18 and hours you can get a lot
01:05:20 more done in that time because you're already
01:05:22 going you're already moving
01:05:24 yeah the initial momentum is the hardest part for sure
01:05:30 when I yeah
01:05:32 like um the times when I've
01:05:34 been most productive or when I'm like
01:05:36 when I'll have a period where I'm like
01:05:40 wake up start immediately
01:05:42 on the thing that I've
01:05:44 been working on lately
01:05:46 you know kind of go through the day
01:05:48 no take breaks maybe but like you know pretty much
01:05:50 work on it and like go to sleep
01:05:52 thinking like tomorrow okay
01:05:54 I made headway tomorrow
01:05:56 I gotta work on this part of it
01:05:58 go to sleep wake up like
01:06:00 okay gotta work on that
01:06:02 thing and then start again immediately
01:06:04 that clarity is like so
01:06:06 fucking hard for me
01:06:08 I have so many projects I'm trying to do and it's like
01:06:10 which one do I work on and it's like just picking one
01:06:12 is so difficult because it's like which one
01:06:14 is the most optimal which will help
01:06:16 my quote-unquote career
01:06:18 it's the worst question to ask
01:06:20 it's terrible
01:06:22 and I'm cursed by it all the time
01:06:24 the best answer to which one is the most
01:06:26 efficient is which everyone is the
01:06:28 least efficient because at least you'll be doing something
01:06:30 oh it's a never ending
01:06:32 never ending pain never ending pain
01:06:34 you just gotta choose one even if it's
01:06:36 the worst possible choice it's better than
01:06:38 not making one that's that's what I think
01:06:40 oh I mean it's it's completely true
01:06:42 but I'm just a
01:06:44 fucking
01:06:46 idiot
01:06:48 I have um
01:06:50 I have a have a couple things
01:06:52 I could be working on right now I have
01:06:54 I have
01:06:56 the the sonichu 102 lecture
01:06:58 which needs a little more editing
01:07:00 and I have to make
01:07:02 some do some shit with that and then I have
01:07:04 the um the next slime and punishment thing
01:07:06 which I've kind of started on
01:07:08 uh that's
01:07:10 yeah I've mostly been working on that
01:07:12 as like a distraction from the
01:07:14 from the the the video because
01:07:16 like I haven't I haven't decided
01:07:18 like what exactly I want to
01:07:20 do with the end of that that video
01:07:22 and I kind of just don't want to think about it
01:07:24 because it's because making decisions is hard
01:07:26 whereas like with the slime and punishment thing
01:07:28 I'm like okay I have a pretty I have a vague idea
01:07:30 of how I want some things
01:07:32 to look in that so I'm just gonna
01:07:34 kind of uh you know I can just
01:07:36 like do some of that bull just fuck around
01:07:38 with that and like you know it doesn't have to
01:07:40 it doesn't have to
01:07:42 I don't have to really commit to very much
01:07:44 just kind of chip away at just like a thing or two here
01:07:46 and there that's all you know
01:07:48 finishing that is like a future bends
01:07:50 problem whereas like
01:07:52 with the sonichu video it's like I could
01:07:54 finish this like right now
01:07:56 and then that would be present bends problem
01:07:58 is like you know the decisions
01:08:00 I made with regard to that and I want
01:08:02 my problems to be in the future
01:08:04 not in the present
01:08:06 you know that makes sense
01:08:08 yeah I I know
01:08:10 but I don't
01:08:12 accept it I will kill you
01:08:14 Ben say okay
01:08:16 okay oh no
01:08:18 Gib has complete authority to kill
01:08:20 us now because you have
01:08:22 completed an entire fucking
01:08:24 ridiculous comic and like
01:08:26 no time at all and you're already starting a second one
01:08:28 and that godly power is just too
01:08:30 much for me I can't stand to look at you
01:08:32 the bright pure energy emanating
01:08:34 from your form burns
01:08:36 my mortal flesh
01:08:38 hmm yeah
01:08:40 I did
01:08:42 I did a good comic one
01:08:44 time I did that once
01:08:46 kind of you only get like 30
01:08:48 days of like a credit for
01:08:50 the glow and then it just fades
01:08:52 you gotta earn it again it's unfortunate but
01:08:54 I don't make the rules
01:08:56 the corona the vapor comes out
01:08:58 I'll see the book and I'll be like
01:09:00 oh my god I remember the vapors
01:09:02 wow this came out like when I was
01:09:04 two years old I just said corona
01:09:06 meaning like a halo without
01:09:08 like not not like the virus not like
01:09:10 the virus that's not we're demonetized
01:09:12 that's too late sorry I didn't mean to I
01:09:14 didn't mean no okay okay
01:09:16 vapors came out
01:09:18 when I was you know
01:09:20 when I was in elementary school
01:09:22 I was reading the vapors and I thought
01:09:24 when's the next one coming out and it
01:09:26 never did the end
01:09:28 and then I decided I would make them
01:09:30 haha
01:09:32 uh
01:09:34 I got
01:09:36 I got a message from
01:09:38 from Jade Morro
01:09:40 today because I was
01:09:42 posting
01:09:44 about the vapor at guest artists

01:10:02 birthday drawing that they had made
01:10:04 for me the like happy birthday
01:10:06 because it was my birthday and they put like
01:10:08 me and some cool stuff there was
01:10:10 Magda and Phantom Horn and a bunch of
01:10:12 little little funny things
01:10:14 there and I'm vaping and it's very nice
01:10:16 and I really liked it and I put that in
01:10:18 as one of like the sample image of like this is this
01:10:20 person's art style and they and Jade was like
01:10:22 oh you save you save the thing
01:10:24 for me from that I made and I was like yeah
01:10:26 I love that and they were like I made
01:10:28 that I made that back when I was in high school
01:10:30 and now I'm in and now I'm in college
01:10:32 and I was like oh my god
01:10:34 oh that was you that I'm
01:10:36 so old Jesus
01:10:38 oh it's the worst the worst
01:10:40 panic is setting in
01:10:42 I literally can't stand
01:10:44 that thought
01:10:46 everybody's got down to youngster
01:10:48 gross disgusting
01:10:50 fucking younglings
01:10:52 I just feel like an outdated human I feel like
01:10:54 I'm running like old firmware and I can't be
01:10:56 updated and it's just like
01:10:58 I can't interface with
01:11:00 social.exe whatever
01:11:02 exists now the new version
01:11:04 I'm not I'm not sure
01:11:06 I'm not sure which is a scarier
01:11:08 thought like the thought of being
01:11:10 like
01:11:12 the thought of being like I'm I'm here
01:11:14 you know I continue
01:11:16 I continue to like age
01:11:18 whereas it feels like the user base
01:11:20 of the internet is not
01:11:22 meaningfully aging there is a certain
01:11:24 like sort of young adultness to it
01:11:26 that is constant yeah and I
01:11:28 am becoming progressively older in comparison
01:11:30 to are they gonna like force us to go on
01:11:32 to Facebook exclusively at some point is that what
01:11:34 happens but but like
01:11:36 that's a scary thought or there's
01:11:38 like oh no I do age
01:11:40 out of it and I go somewhere else like where
01:11:42 the old people go no I think what happens
01:11:44 I don't know which is worse the new internet
01:11:46 just starts and it's gonna be new apps and things
01:11:48 that we don't understand like tiktok's already doing that
01:11:50 like although the young young kids
01:11:52 are on tiktok you know like the 15 16 17
01:11:54 year olds like people who understand the new
01:11:56 new new internet
01:11:58 tiktok is not like a replacement for other
01:12:00 social media it's like the biggest app out
01:12:02 right now
01:12:04 I feel like there's probably a new tiktok already
01:12:06 that we're not aware of probably there probably
01:12:08 will be and then tiktok
01:12:10 there's the one that there's the one that donald trump
01:12:12 made an account on right wait what

01:14:56 everybody gets one you're done
01:14:58 oh
01:15:00 to the boomer farms with you
01:15:02 but what about um
01:15:04 uh
01:15:06 the arrow in the knee do you remember that one
01:15:08 oh you're just digging your grave even further
01:15:10 the cake
01:15:12 maybe the cake was telling the truth
01:15:14 the whole time
01:15:16 there will probably be people
01:15:18 listening to this podcast who barely know
01:15:20 those references
01:15:22 dude it's great I
01:15:24 the whole thing about getting old is like
01:15:26 yeah it's kind of sad you know the grave
01:15:28 and all that whatever cool
01:15:30 but one thing I have found
01:15:32 increasingly funny is when I
01:15:34 realized that somebody is old
01:15:36 young younger than me
01:15:38 which is often
01:15:40 like they're like quite a lot younger
01:15:42 then I it
01:15:44 has become increasingly funny to just say
01:15:46 things that were around when I was
01:15:48 around like young and there are no longer
01:15:50 around just to rub it in their
01:15:52 faces they don't care in any way
01:15:54 they have no reason to care but I just
01:15:56 it's just really funny that I would just
01:15:58 oh my god like you don't even
01:16:00 know VHS and they don't
01:16:02 laugh but I laugh no
01:16:04 it's really funny I wouldn't laugh either
01:16:06 it's only funny to me
01:16:08 but it keeps getting funny I don't know about that
01:16:10 it keeps getting funny like the older
01:16:12 I get I'm just gonna say
01:16:14 you don't even know what a cassette tape is
01:16:16 so young and
01:16:18 they're like shut up shut up
01:16:22 there's oh oh my god
01:16:24 oh my god that reminds me
01:16:26 holy shit I almost
01:16:28 I almost don't even want to talk about
01:16:30 this because I feel like
01:16:32 it
01:16:34 ah fuck it you know what
01:16:36 it's the podcast
01:16:38 I was considering if maybe I should
01:16:40 make like a video about this but I don't know what I would
01:16:42 even say about it to be honest but um alright
01:16:44 so my friend
01:16:46 Hargadine
01:16:48 sent me
01:16:50 something in the mail
01:16:52 and by sending me something in the mail
01:16:54 I mean left it on my
01:16:56 on my front porch
01:16:58 and bolted in the dead of night
01:17:00 um
01:17:02 and you're not going
01:17:04 you're not going to fucking believe what it is
01:17:06 like I like a goat's head
01:17:08 like what is it
01:17:10 it's
01:17:12 I can't say it
01:17:14 I can't I can't
01:17:16 I can't make myself verbalize it
01:17:18 because it's beyond belief it defies
01:17:20 description
01:17:22 I feel like I'm in a dream
01:17:24 is it a Benzite themed
01:17:26 flashlight
01:17:28 no
01:17:30 no it's both volumes
01:17:32 of the official Avril Lavigne
01:17:34 manga
01:17:36 what
01:17:38 how
01:17:40 what
01:17:44 I've only read the first one
01:17:46 but I'll get to the second one
01:17:48 when was that so difficult to say
01:17:50 I mean it's funny
01:17:52 I don't know
01:17:54 I just can't believe it
01:17:56 I just can't believe
01:17:58 that I'm so blessed to live in a world
01:18:00 where I
01:18:02 not only exist but I
01:18:04 am the proud owner
01:18:06 Avril Lavigne's make five wishes
01:18:08 volumes one and two
01:18:10 what does the
01:18:12 wait what does it look like
01:18:14 how good is the manga
01:18:16 um
01:18:18 does it feel Japanesey
01:18:20 no not particularly no
01:18:22 and it reads left to right
01:18:24 so you know it pretty
01:18:26 poser manga
01:18:28 does it look like we're just how to draw manga books
01:18:30 from the mid two thousands
01:18:32 no it's
01:18:34 it's a little manga ish
01:18:36 but you can tell it was drawn by like a western artist
01:18:38 and like it's fine it's okay
01:18:40 uh um it's very
01:18:42 what's the plot what's the story
01:18:44 it's very rough it kinda looks
01:18:46 like it was drawn with a ballpoint pen
01:18:48 well uh some of the panels are
01:18:50 very sketchy
01:18:52 and in a way that is like
01:18:54 you're telling me the guy who got contracted to make the
01:18:56 Avril Lavigne manga didn't put his heart into it
01:18:58 it's a
01:19:00 it's a girl
01:19:02 well it's a girl artist and a guy who like
01:19:04 wrote the story okay
01:19:06 I mean I guess I'll just say it
01:19:08 it's drawn by Avril Lavigne herself
01:19:10 no it's starring Avril Lavigne
01:19:12 Avril Lavigne had nothing to do with it
01:19:14 but she's starring in it
01:19:16 and then created by Camilla
01:19:18 Derrico and Joshua Disart
01:19:20 um
01:19:22 the okay the plot is
01:19:24 and again I've only read half of it
01:19:26 it's it's basically just a monkey's paw
01:19:28 like it's literally a monkey's paw
01:19:30 story about a like a
01:19:32 girl who
01:19:34 has like she's like a kid
01:19:36 who's like sad about stuff
01:19:38 and doesn't like school and whatever
01:19:40 is unpopular or whatever
01:19:42 and she finds this website
01:19:44 called makefivewishes.com
01:19:46 and she orders something and
01:19:48 which what shows up is a demon
01:19:50 and the demon has
01:19:52 like these five horns and she can like
01:19:54 make a wish and like crack it
01:19:56 and it's literally just monkey's paw right
01:19:58 she can make five wishes
01:20:00 um and there's and stuff happens
01:20:02 uh she's like oh what if I was
01:20:04 I wish my boy would notice me
01:20:06 like oh I wish this old man that I don't like
01:20:08 would go away
01:20:10 you know it's like oh that's
01:20:12 bad that's uh you know bad things
01:20:14 are gonna happen if you just make wishes really nearly like that kid
01:20:16 uh the the only
01:20:18 relevance to it at all
01:20:20 is that she's a big Avril Lavigne fan
01:20:22 and Avril Lavigne
01:20:24 is like her imaginary friend
01:20:26 and it's basically just like her
01:20:28 her her better nature
01:20:30 like when like she like
01:20:32 is being cruel to an old man
01:20:34 Avril Lavigne is like
01:20:36 the voice of her conscience being like
01:20:38 stop don't say these things
01:20:40 and she's like yeah I hate you
01:20:42 you're old and ugly and Avril's like oh
01:20:44 you shouldn't have said that that's mean
01:20:46 um it's just like D.W.
01:20:48 and her imaginary friend from Arthur
01:20:50 it's like these did
01:20:52 did D.W. have an imaginary friend?
01:20:54 right wasn't her name?
01:20:56 oh yeah that rings a bell
01:20:58 was never a huge Arthur fan
01:21:00 well you missed that
01:21:02 some good shit
01:21:04 I mean I mean I read the Arthur books
01:21:06 Arthur PCP lecture
01:21:08 in second grade
01:21:10 I mean we should make like Arthur analysis
01:21:12 videos about each episode
01:21:14 with our Arthur Sonas
01:21:16 we have to make them drawn
01:21:18 like as our actual selves in that uncanny
01:21:20 valley style that Arthur uses for
01:21:22 real life guest stars
01:21:24 oh yeah
01:21:26 I don't know what you're referring to
01:21:28 look up Matt Damon Arthur
01:21:30 I think Matt Damon was on Arthur at one point
01:21:32 and he just looks like a real person
01:21:34 face on an Arthur character
01:21:36 it's very strange
01:21:38 oh my fucking god
01:21:40 that's how they had guest stars on Arthur
01:21:42 they just look like
01:21:44 that's so bad
01:21:46 this can't be real why would they do this
01:21:48 why would they fucking do this
01:21:50 how else did you know
01:21:52 it's Matt Damon
01:21:54 what the fuck
01:21:56 yeah it's
01:21:58 interesting stylistic choices
01:22:00 they just have fucking full human faces
01:22:02 yeah it's very weird
01:22:04 what the fuck
01:22:06 this is
01:22:08 bad
01:22:10 it's so bad
01:22:12 I can't believe this
01:22:14 alright we gotta put that
01:22:16 Ben it's strange to me
01:22:18 cause I just you being you
01:22:20 I would have pegged you as someone who
01:22:22 watched Arthur I was at least familiar enough with it
01:22:24 to know what this was about it just seems like
01:22:26 something you would know about
01:22:28 seems like in your real house
01:22:30 no
01:22:32 when I was a little kid in second grade
01:22:34 we had the Arthur books
01:22:36 in the school library and that's how I was familiar
01:22:38 with them and then when I was a little older
01:22:40 there was the show
01:22:42 but I was like oh I read these books
01:22:44 when I was in second grade first grade
01:22:46 like that's like a little baby show
01:22:48 so like I was like no I don't want to watch
01:22:50 this Arthur cartoon that's for like
01:22:52 fucking little baby childs
01:22:54 but I think uh I don't know
01:22:56 apparently it was kind of a pretty good kid show
01:22:58 people seem to have mostly
01:23:00 fond memories of it but I was like
01:23:02 not interested I haven't seen it in so fucking long
01:23:04 I have no idea if it's any good or not
01:23:06 but they're just things like Matt Damon
01:23:08 that are just burned into my brain
01:23:10 I feel like it was pretty good
01:23:12 somewhat funny
01:23:14 and like wholesome
01:23:16 family entertainment
01:23:18 mm-hmm
01:23:20 but I don't really recall it too much
01:23:22 there's like a couple episodes that I remember seeing
01:23:24 multiple times
01:23:26 where like DW
01:23:28 breaks the airplane and Arthur punches her
01:23:30 and he gets in trouble
01:23:32 you shouldn't punch your sister
01:23:34 I don't know
01:23:36 there are a couple like clips
01:23:38 that like I guess they've made some pretty
01:23:40 like
01:23:42 meta jokes on the show
01:23:44 every now and then and like I think I've seen
01:23:46 a bunch of those on like YouTube
01:23:48 whatever in a way that's like
01:23:50 okay I'm sure every episode wasn't like
01:23:52 that but you know these are kind of funny
01:23:54 these are interesting
01:23:56 I remember
01:23:58 I mean I remember one joke from it
01:24:00 that I really liked and it stuck with me for years and years
01:24:02 you know there was the theme song
01:24:04 every day when you walking down
01:24:06 the street
01:24:08 you get along with each other
01:24:10 I remember they had the one episode where like
01:24:12 they have a little sequence where
01:24:14 brain they tell a little brain
01:24:16 side story and they play like
01:24:18 the brain version of the theme song
01:24:20 and it's like
01:24:22 every day when you walking down the street
01:24:24 you stop and think
01:24:26 hmm
01:24:28 and that's it that's the end of the song
01:24:30 like yes
01:24:32 cool
01:24:34 I stop and think
01:24:36 I do
01:24:38 brain does
01:24:40 end of song
01:24:42 incredible
01:24:44 cool good job
01:24:46 they did like a South Park parody right
01:24:48 they did
01:24:50 and that's pretty weird
01:24:52 that Arthur would do that
01:24:54 yeah
01:24:56 if you're a little baby kid you shouldn't be watching South Park
01:24:58 that's for grown
01:25:00 that's for the parents who are sitting there watching like 17 episodes
01:25:02 of Arthur with their kids in a row
01:25:04 and there's a little bit of levity to like make sure
01:25:06 they're still alive you know and they haven't died
01:25:08 mm-hmm
01:25:10 God bless you
01:25:12 God bless you Arthur
01:25:14 I am really perplexed
01:25:16 by this line and the second image
01:25:18 I posted tell Arthur
01:25:20 this is Matt Damon
01:25:22 hardfark saying tell Arthur
01:25:24 he'll never eat lunch in this town again
01:25:26 and he appears to be naked
01:25:28 he does
01:25:30 what is happening
01:25:32 what is happening you just got to watch them
01:25:34 to find out
01:25:36 is that like in sync
01:25:38 I believe it is
01:25:40 or Backstreet Boys maybe one of the two
01:25:42 wait
01:25:44 did one of them have a black guy
01:25:46 you know
01:25:48 why is that one darker
01:25:50 I don't remember I think they're
01:25:52 I think they were already
01:25:54 we're already in the thin line already
01:25:56 let's take some risks
01:25:58 I don't remember
01:26:00 there being a darker one
01:26:02 there are those pans but what do I know
01:26:06 okay cool cool
01:26:08 um
01:26:10 alright
01:26:12 how do we how do we fucking oh right
01:26:14 the Avril manga
01:26:16 I don't know should I make a video where I review
01:26:18 Avril Lavigne's Make 5 Boys
01:26:20 I haven't finished yet so I haven't said the ending
01:26:22 you should do a
01:26:24 like one-to-one like parody
01:26:26 of a Likara review
01:26:28 where you
01:26:30 do the voice and then you talk about
01:26:32 the Avril Lavigne manga
01:26:34 and post it online
01:26:36 and that's what you should do
01:26:38 I
01:26:40 I would probably do
01:26:42 if I was going to ape anyone
01:26:44 it would be Jenny Nicholson
01:26:46 and I would probably do one where I just like
01:26:48 sit on my bed
01:26:50 and look into the camera
01:26:52 because why not you know that's engaging
01:26:54 I'm there I'm making eye contact
01:26:56 with you the viewer it's quarantine
01:26:58 you're starved for affection
01:27:00 you're starved for connection and I'm giving it to you
01:27:02 let's laugh together
01:27:04 over the strange cultural artifact
01:27:06 I really want to
01:27:08 kind of like the idea of like a
01:27:10 high up camera
01:27:12 view
01:27:14 sitting on his bed talking about
01:27:16 Avril Lavigne did you say swole
01:27:18 Benzane small Benzane like like
01:27:20 oh small Benzane okay
01:27:22 I prefer swole but
01:27:24 but sure okay
01:27:26 that's
01:27:28 the unfortunate thing about
01:27:30 Avril Lavigne's make five wishes
01:27:32 is that
01:27:34 like you know because Avril is such
01:27:36 like a non entity
01:27:38 it's not that weird
01:27:40 like the story is not that weird and it's not like
01:27:42 really it's not like
01:27:44 super bad or like
01:27:46 ridiculous it's just like pretty normal
01:27:48 the actual story is pretty like
01:27:50 okay it's a monkey's paw story
01:27:52 about a sad girl oh well
01:27:54 darn you're only you're only halfway done things
01:27:56 could go off the rails
01:27:58 let me see let me let me flip through
01:28:00 and if I see anything going off the rails
01:28:02 um
01:28:04 could be a demon fight oh my god who knows
01:28:06 is she is she going Super Saiyan
01:28:08 I mean you've already have my attention
01:28:10 is she
01:28:12 oh my god she's like glowing
01:28:14 there's got to be a metaphor
01:28:16 she can't be literally glowing
01:28:18 oh my god she's
01:28:20 okay no I'm not I'm not gonna spoil
01:28:22 myself I'm not gonna spoil myself I'm not gonna
01:28:24 tell you what happens all right six
01:28:26 okay I'm ready for the video
01:28:28 I might do it might be
01:28:30 kind of funny I'm gonna do
01:28:32 I'm gonna I'm gonna do a cooking video I'm gonna do
01:28:34 I'm gonna do a how to make gummies video
01:28:36 um but you know what
01:28:38 tragedy struck this week
01:28:40 because I was like well
01:28:42 I'm almost out of my worm syrup
01:28:44 time to buy more powder
01:28:46 and uh it's it's
01:28:48 not it's not there it's not on Amazon I
01:28:50 can't get it they're like out of stock
01:28:54 and I don't there's no no nobody else sells
01:28:56 it wasn't that a problem last time
01:28:58 didn't you just have to wait well
01:29:00 last time they stopped selling
01:29:02 the syrup which is why I had to
01:29:04 get the powder again and like re
01:29:06 like reformulate the whole thing because
01:29:08 I'm like okay well now I don't know the
01:29:10 I don't know what the original
01:29:12 like concentration was now I gotta figure that out from
01:29:14 scratch and I finally did figure it out
01:29:16 that was okay great problem solved
01:29:18 I can do it with the powder instead
01:29:20 but now the powder is gone too
01:29:22 and I'm thinking like
01:29:24 is this like is isomolta
01:29:26 oligosaccharide just like a vanishing
01:29:28 resource on earth and they're just like running
01:29:30 out and there's no more like why
01:29:32 please
01:29:34 what am I gonna do
01:29:36 and I'm thinking like you know they
01:29:38 stopped selling those gummy like the
01:29:40 gummies that have the same main ingredient that I
01:29:42 was why I started making these they stopped
01:29:44 selling those at Whole Foods I don't see them at Whole Foods anymore
01:29:46 and I'm like did they just vanish is this
01:29:48 have they just like stopped farming
01:29:50 this powder does it just not get produced
01:29:52 anymore like what what does the powder made
01:29:54 of how does it get made
01:29:56 the powder is made of um
01:29:58 oh fuck what's the plant
01:30:00 it's made of it's not
01:30:02 chicory root
01:30:04 um wait
01:30:06 actually it's time to start a farm
01:30:08 then tapioca it's it's
01:30:10 it's soluble fiber extracted
01:30:12 from tapioca okay
01:30:14 just do that just get tapioca
01:30:16 and soluble fiber
01:30:18 listen yeah
01:30:20 yeah you yeah that's the
01:30:22 that's the tricky part that's the tricky part isn't
01:30:24 isn't it just just go to go
01:30:26 to chemistry our chemistry and
01:30:28 and say hey how do I do this and then
01:30:30 we extract the soluble fiber from tapioca
01:30:32 and they'll say oh oh you
01:30:34 fool oh you simpleton oh here
01:30:36 let me let me show you let me come to
01:30:38 your house god you fucking idiot
01:30:40 check the FAQ before you post
01:30:42 there's
01:30:44 there's another
01:30:46 thing there's a similar
01:30:48 powder called inulin
01:30:50 which I have some of that
01:30:52 and I'm going to try using it
01:30:54 instead and it might work
01:30:56 like exactly the same and be like a
01:30:58 viable substitute or it might not
01:31:00 I don't know um so
01:31:02 I guess we'll see how that goes
01:31:04 I don't know and the future
01:31:06 is uncertain
01:31:08 I just I'm a drift
01:31:10 I'm without an anchor
01:31:12 in this gummy sea that I'm
01:31:14 sailing I don't know where
01:31:16 when I'll find the shore
01:31:18 and the storms are brewing
01:31:22 if you if you catch my drift
01:31:26 I think I do it's bad
01:31:28 news for worm boy
01:31:30 it's bad news for worm boy
01:31:34 and I'm all out of mango flavor
01:31:36 it's the second best flavor
01:31:38 mango and passion fruit easily the best
01:31:40 flavor is buy a mile
01:31:42 peach is pretty good I guess
01:31:46 the company that I buy the flavors from
01:31:48 like those ones are good
01:31:50 and then a couple of them are like bad
01:31:52 like their cherry is just like bad
01:31:54 like I don't know how you fuck up cherry
01:31:56 that's like so simple but it did
01:31:58 the cherry tastes like ass
01:32:00 apple bad pear bad
01:32:02 it's a shame because I really like
01:32:04 pears
01:32:06 I really like like green apple
01:32:08 and I like cherry I like I like all those
01:32:10 and you think they no those are bad
01:32:12 I'll never buy them again
01:32:14 passion fruit though
01:32:16 that's my favorite it smells so good
01:32:18 it tastes so good
01:32:22 I can't wait to eat a gummy worm
01:32:24 I can't wait to eat it
01:32:26 I can't wait to make them but oh but I can't
01:32:28 there's no more powder oh it's gone
01:32:30 okay okay
01:32:32 okay
01:32:34 um well
01:32:36 I have one more thing
01:32:38 I could mention it's a bit of a weird
01:32:40 topic though it's a bit of a heavy topic
01:32:42 base
01:32:44 and it's this is just a question so
01:32:46 I was uh you know
01:32:48 browsing the pornography
01:32:50 sites to see some
01:32:52 whoa whoa whoa what the fuck
01:32:54 I know
01:32:56 give there's
01:32:58 this is this is a children's program
01:33:00 what every
01:33:02 time we every time we post an episode
01:33:04 we click the little box that says is this for children yes
01:33:08 shit hey children
01:33:10 go to pornography.com they know
01:33:12 I know that and you know that
01:33:14 but you're not allowed to say it
01:33:16 we're not allowed to acknowledge that
01:33:18 universal truth anyway
01:33:20 this is a this is a moral
01:33:22 quandary because I came across
01:33:24 um pornography
01:33:26 like a drawn stuff
01:33:28 of jaden animations
01:33:30 the youtuber
01:33:32 the the story time youtuber girl
01:33:34 lady yeah I don't
01:33:36 know what she looks I've never seen her in like
01:33:38 no it wasn't it wasn't her
01:33:40 in real life um
01:33:42 it was her character that she uses
01:33:44 in all of her videos with the the
01:33:46 hair and stuff yeah
01:33:48 and and they you know
01:33:50 it was a sexually
01:33:52 it was a porn with her
01:33:54 as the thing
01:33:56 okay amazing
01:33:58 hmm
01:34:00 like my first thought was
01:34:02 that's not correct you can't do that
01:34:04 because jaden animations is not a character
01:34:06 created by jaden animations
01:34:08 the that's just how she
01:34:10 chooses to portray herself
01:34:12 in the videos where she talks about very
01:34:14 personal things and that is her
01:34:16 for all intents and purposes
01:34:18 and then just because it's a cartoon
01:34:20 people find it
01:34:22 to be okay to make pornography of it
01:34:24 I'm not I'm not sure
01:34:26 where like it's it's
01:34:28 it's weird because it's like
01:34:30 no I don't
01:34:32 think I agree with you I think
01:34:34 I think if it's a it's a cartoon
01:34:36 avatar I kind of think it's fair game
01:34:38 well this is what what I was
01:34:40 wondering about because the
01:34:42 cartoon avatar aspect
01:34:44 regardless of that there's been like
01:34:46 I mean there was game grumps porn
01:34:48 like of John and Aaron fucking each other
01:34:50 and Danny and Aaron and this is like
01:34:52 that human beings they know what
01:34:54 everyone knows what they look like
01:34:56 pornography of them
01:34:58 they don't seem to mind they think it's funny
01:35:00 as far as I know
01:35:02 but like
01:35:04 I feel like
01:35:06 jaden herself would is not
01:35:08 the sort of person who would be okay with
01:35:10 this and so I feel like
01:35:12 is is it a is it a case by
01:35:14 case thing is it just sort of like a
01:35:16 politeness like if they don't like it
01:35:18 maybe don't do that because it's
01:35:20 that that is there like
01:35:22 is there likeness in all the ways that matter
01:35:24 well
01:35:26 and it's not like a character designed by
01:35:28 them I don't know
01:35:30 are you say like
01:35:32 when you say don't do it
01:35:34 I didn't say that
01:35:36 but I'm playing
01:35:38 it yes
01:35:40 well like
01:35:42 I don't know do you mean it shouldn't be allowed
01:35:44 I don't know I found
01:35:46 it to be a question
01:35:48 like because it was good art
01:35:50 and
01:35:52 I'm like well it looks good but like
01:35:54 I feel a bit
01:35:56 weird about it because I know that she would
01:35:58 not like this
01:36:00 because I you know I've watched a few of her
01:36:02 videos I know what she's like she is sort of
01:36:04 I don't know self-conscious
01:36:06 about these sorts
01:36:08 of things
01:36:10 so it's just sort of the context
01:36:12 of it being
01:36:14 her and like the
01:36:16 like I'm not trying to like
01:36:18 decide on like what is the rule we should have
01:36:20 for all things I don't know
01:36:22 if it's if it's okay to do it with the
01:36:24 game grumps
01:36:26 then I don't think that like her
01:36:28 the fact that she wouldn't like it
01:36:30 means that it's not okay to do it
01:36:32 I don't think it's not
01:36:34 it means it's not okay I just think
01:36:36 it's
01:36:38 probably shouldn't anyway like I don't think anyone should
01:36:40 get in trouble for it I don't think it's quote-unquote
01:36:42 bad but I think if
01:36:44 it's someone's
01:36:46 representation of themselves and you're
01:36:48 projecting like your
01:36:50 fantasies onto a real person
01:36:52 essentially
01:36:54 and they're not comfortable with it it's probably not like
01:36:56 you probably shouldn't but like it's the
01:36:58 internet you're not going to be able to stop it
01:37:00 and like if you're jaden animations you kind of have to
01:37:02 like know going into like becoming
01:37:04 a public-facing figure that this is just
01:37:06 one of the things that happens to you
01:37:08 yep
01:37:10 sorry
01:37:12 uh yeah
01:37:14 I mean I was
01:37:16 at first you know I was like
01:37:18 humming and hoeing over it
01:37:20 and then I went to see the artists
01:37:22 like they clicked on their name
01:37:24 their name was like signed
01:37:26 and they had their twitter account and
01:37:28 their attitude was sort of like
01:37:30 what pushed me to making it
01:37:32 to thinking that it was wrong because they were like
01:37:36 in the comments like they had this
01:37:38 pinned and in the comments
01:37:40 people were like you can't do that this is immoral
01:37:42 this is like this is a real person
01:37:44 and there was a very clear
01:37:46 divide of people who just said
01:37:48 um get mad
01:37:50 go cry somewhere
01:37:52 fuck you nobody cares
01:37:54 we'll we just want a fat
01:37:56 and um
01:37:58 the people who are like
01:38:00 you know trying to be a little bit
01:38:02 you know moral
01:38:04 about it
01:38:06 and uh I just
01:38:08 I just I didn't like the attitude of the artists
01:38:10 because the artist was like
01:38:12 fuck you go die
01:38:14 if you don't like it
01:38:16 I'm gonna keep drawing it and it's like
01:38:18 I guess like you can do that
01:38:20 it's not like I'm gonna try and stop you
01:38:22 but
01:38:24 it just got me thinking because it's not something
01:38:26 I had not come across that before
01:38:32 even though I did know about
01:38:34 Game Grumps stuff though I guess I had come
01:38:36 across it before
01:38:38 there's already been a thing I just like
01:38:40 more of a visceral like reaction to that one
01:38:42 I mean
01:38:44 I don't know do is it
01:38:46 is it okay to do that with like
01:38:48 Aaron and Dan
01:38:50 John whatever
01:38:52 I mean if they're if they don't have a problem
01:38:54 with it I kind of
01:38:56 I kind of don't see what their opinion
01:38:58 has to do with it
01:39:02 well I guess it's just sort of like a courtesy thing
01:39:04 like if you ever want to get along with
01:39:06 them and they don't like it and you do it anyway
01:39:08 then you're not going to be
01:39:10 able to get along with them but there's
01:39:12 you know the whether it's wrong or right
01:39:14 to do I think it's
01:39:16 it's there's no like
01:39:18 hard and fast rule like you should
01:39:20 be allowed to do it
01:39:22 and the people who approve of it
01:39:24 will like it and the people who disapprove
01:39:26 of it will not like it or you
01:39:28 and that's just how
01:39:30 it will be
01:39:36 well
01:39:38 I think if
01:39:40 I mean does she know about it
01:39:42 I she said anything about it
01:39:44 like I don't know all
01:39:46 this is weird because there's
01:39:48 lots of them like it was wasn't just
01:39:50 one artist it was like a whole tag
01:39:52 and I was like oh oh
01:39:54 okay
01:39:56 so it's big enough
01:39:58 that she probably has heard about it
01:40:00 I don't know if she said anything about it I don't follow her
01:40:02 too closely I mean I wouldn't
01:40:04 if I were her
01:40:06 yes
01:40:08 but uh
01:40:10 that's the
01:40:12 event that happened
01:40:14 on thepornography.com
01:40:16 that's pretty weird
01:40:18 what's the
01:40:20 URL for that
01:40:22 what's the uh
01:40:24 send me the link
01:40:26 so I can like really get an informed
01:40:28 opinion about that
01:40:30 I can't remember the name of the artist but I guess
01:40:32 I can go look and find it
01:40:34 if you actually want to see it
01:40:36 no I don't know
01:40:38 I actually
01:40:40 I don't even know what Jaden animations looks
01:40:42 like what her avatar looks like
01:40:44 it's like barely anything right
01:40:46 it's just like a little brown hair
01:40:48 long brown hair I think
01:40:50 it's a stick figure with a purple shirt usually
01:40:52 and the brown hair with distinctive
01:40:54 curls in it
01:40:56 and it's like you know
01:40:58 iconic I guess
01:41:00 the bigger talk people animation
01:41:02 things
01:41:04 story time
01:41:06 okay
01:41:08 I remember
01:41:10 wow
01:41:12 I google it
01:41:14 and I don't even have to google Jaden animations porn
01:41:16 and like one of the first results is like a picture
01:41:18 of her like getting a wedgie
01:41:20 and like her butt cheeks are kind of showing
01:41:22 so like okay
01:41:24 yeah I mean it's I guess it's
01:41:26 it's just one of those
01:41:28 things where it is a female
01:41:30 and it is there for
01:41:32 yeah that's the thing that was
01:41:34 annoying me a little bit there were some people who were saying
01:41:36 I invoke rule 34
01:41:38 like that's like that
01:41:40 I mean I understand that's like the funny joke
01:41:42 there's porn on the google search
01:41:44 there's porn on the first page of the google search just for Jaden animations
01:41:46 okay this isn't even like this isn't even
01:41:48 niche it's like yeah
01:41:50 rule 34
01:41:52 if it exists this porn of it does not mean
01:41:54 that it is like okay
01:41:56 to do and like should be okay
01:41:58 people people were invoking
01:42:00 rule 34 like it was an actual
01:42:02 oh I see I see
01:42:04 and it's like stupid
01:42:06 it's like oh well yeah
01:42:08 okay yeah that's a terrible argument
01:42:10 it's like um oh well didn't
01:42:12 you know that this thing
01:42:14 always happens therefore
01:42:16 it is good
01:42:18 right right very stupid
01:42:20 something an idiot would think gotcha
01:42:22 yes
01:42:24 but uh well
01:42:26 I mean people have drawn
01:42:28 like my characters
01:42:30 but not of me
01:42:32 I think
01:42:34 well now it's gonna happen
01:42:36 not too late not anymore
01:42:38 I don't know
01:42:42 I keep thinking
01:42:44 like well it's you know it's okay
01:42:46 to do it with the grumps so why not Jaden
01:42:48 but it's like
01:42:50 was it okay
01:42:52 is that is that violating
01:42:54 Dan and Aaron's
01:42:56 fucking autonomy or whatever even if
01:42:58 they don't care like is it not
01:43:00 okay to do am I just
01:43:02 am I just drawing on precedent
01:43:04 it is an interesting set of questions
01:43:06 is it dealing more
01:43:08 with real people that are not
01:43:10 explicitly like in the
01:43:12 the porn industry
01:43:14 like you could draw a porn of a porn
01:43:16 artist and nobody would have bad an eye because they already do that
01:43:18 it's sort of like in the same
01:43:20 way that it's not right
01:43:22 the sort of like celebrity
01:43:24 um
01:43:26 candid photo culture
01:43:28 where they try to get upskirts of like famous
01:43:30 women coming out of the car
01:43:32 like that sort of stuff it's not right but I also
01:43:34 don't really care because they're celebrities and they have loads of money
01:43:36 and I don't know
01:43:38 anything about that world
01:43:40 it you know it's like bad
01:43:42 for them but it's not so bad
01:43:44 that I should like fight
01:43:46 for their rights because it's
01:43:48 it's not it's not that big of a deal
01:43:50 really
01:43:52 yeah
01:43:54 but then again it's like it's
01:43:56 it's a complicated it's a complicated thing
01:44:00 agreed
01:44:02 you can't fight every single battle
01:44:04 yeah I'm going back and forth
01:44:06 I think
01:44:08 I don't know what to think about this
01:44:10 sorry
01:44:12 shall we
01:44:14 if you have something to say in the comments
01:44:16 and you haven't already commented
01:44:18 and left then you can
01:44:20 say something in the comments and will
01:44:22 tell me tell me what to tell me what to think
01:44:24 please
01:44:26 the one time will ever divert
01:44:28 to commenters for our opinions
01:44:30 ah
01:44:32 well that
01:44:34 sure was a diversion
01:44:36 um
01:44:38 what do we think are we are we
01:44:40 it's time for voicemail I think it's time for voicemail
01:44:42 yeah we're closing in on
01:44:44 almost two hours
01:44:46 oh shit right now
01:44:48 how did we do that
01:44:50 well we're really smart
01:44:52 we're really
01:44:54 you know there's not there's not that many
01:44:56 there's not that many today there's only one two
01:44:58 three four five six
01:45:00 seven
01:45:02 eight nine ten eleven there's only
01:45:04 twelve emails or voicemails so
01:45:06 oh we're gonna
01:45:08 we're gonna blast through these
01:45:10 I gotta open up the voicemail tab and
01:45:12 do time flat I would say
01:45:18 in Toronto do we have any
01:45:20 do we have any
01:45:22 familiar names
01:45:24 yeah one or two yeah a couple of
01:45:26 names I recognize here
01:45:28 very good
01:45:30 right
01:45:32 I'm ready
01:45:34 okay uh first one we're gonna do
01:45:36 is hobbies and productivity
01:45:38 three two
01:45:40 one hobbies are not meant
01:45:42 to be productive and anyone who thinks otherwise
01:45:44 is a fool
01:45:46 if you're doing something as a hobby and your main goal
01:45:48 is for it to be productive over being fun
01:45:50 you should have made that thing your job
01:45:52 dumbass the point of
01:45:54 a hobby is to relax and not be
01:45:56 productive so you don't kill yourself
01:45:58 from fucking
01:46:00 burnout
01:46:04 um so if you're trying to be productive with a hobby
01:46:06 it's a side hustle it's not a hobby
01:46:08 anymore
01:46:10 yeah well um
01:46:12 you know a lot of people
01:46:14 want to make their would want to make their hobby
01:46:16 their job in some way
01:46:18 that's a lot of people's goal
01:46:20 you're doing something on the side with the hope of
01:46:22 making it your main thing
01:46:24 I think the problem the things
01:46:26 with like the people
01:46:28 have issues with hobbies and things is like even if
01:46:30 you're doing something as a hobby like if you're just drawing
01:46:32 and like I just want to draw for fun you know
01:46:34 like with social media and everything like everything
01:46:36 has metrics now besides just I'm making
01:46:38 money off it versus I'm not
01:46:40 and you get into that mentality of like now
01:46:42 I'm like in a market and competing with other people
01:46:44 and because I'm trying to just like
01:46:46 get recognition and that kind
01:46:48 of makes it feel like a job even if you're
01:46:50 not trying to make money off it or make it your job
01:46:52 hmm yeah
01:46:54 I mean
01:46:56 me like a big number me like a number go up
01:46:58 exactly when you I mean
01:47:00 when you're being
01:47:02 you could be productive in a hobby
01:47:04 even if it's something you're not monetized
01:47:06 like if you're if you're just gardening like
01:47:08 for fun you can you know
01:47:10 you can be productive have a productive day
01:47:12 in your garden I think what they mean you know
01:47:14 all these flowers are like you know well fertilized
01:47:16 now I think what they're talking about is like
01:47:18 being productive at the expense
01:47:20 of the
01:47:22 relaxation which is the main point
01:47:24 right like if being productive
01:47:26 in the garden is what makes it fun then of course
01:47:28 that's part of it
01:47:30 but like if it's a fucking chore
01:47:32 and you kind of dislike it
01:47:34 then it's not a hobby it's something else
01:47:38 it's a fucking work it's
01:47:40 it's a chore literally
01:47:42 yeah
01:47:44 if you're starting to stress about it
01:47:46 you know yeah
01:47:48 yeah you have a motive
01:47:50 there at some
01:47:52 level of consciousness besides just having fun
01:47:54 yeah I have a hobby
01:47:56 in crochet and I haven't touched
01:47:58 my yarn in months but that's fine
01:48:00 I'll get around to it when I
01:48:02 feel like it
01:48:04 hmm
01:48:06 I guess my hobby would be
01:48:08 yeah I guess worms are my hobby
01:48:10 yeah that's what I was gonna say
01:48:12 like I don't think you've ever been stressed about that at all really
01:48:14 well
01:48:16 other than like just like the
01:48:18 the toil of doing the work
01:48:20 I mean it stresses me out to go on Amazon and see that
01:48:22 they don't sell isomolto oligosaccharides anymore
01:48:24 well that's more stress with capitalism
01:48:26 then
01:48:28 everything else
01:48:30 of the other Sakurai that made smash bros
01:48:32 yeah fructo oligosaccharide
01:48:34 was the smash bros guy
01:48:40 but that's not stress from my hobby
01:48:42 that's stress from an external
01:48:44 force preventing me from doing it
01:48:48 I guess I am gonna
01:48:50 turn that into if I make a video about that
01:48:52 which I want to I guess that would sort of be
01:48:54 turning it into a side hustle I guess
01:48:56 technically I might make ad revenue off that but like
01:49:00 a couple thousand people
01:49:02 I just want to make that like just because
01:49:04 I want to I think yeah I think getting the word out
01:49:06 like making money from something
01:49:08 doesn't necessarily make it a side hustle
01:49:10 especially if it's something like a video where it's almost
01:49:12 incidental you know but like
01:49:14 if you were like making that video like okay I'm
01:49:16 gonna make this I'm gonna start building an audience to try
01:49:18 I'm gonna rebrand
01:49:20 my whole my whole online persona
01:49:22 I'm gonna be the worm guy that's where it becomes
01:49:24 a side hustle
01:49:26 sure sure sure
01:49:28 um yeah
01:49:30 alright
01:49:32 thanks for the call
01:49:34 next one literally

01:49:54 I
01:49:56 mean
01:49:58 I wonder I wonder if maybe

01:50:04 controls we'll never know
01:50:06 we will never know

01:50:32 well that well that that just makes my day
01:50:34 yeah gotta say
01:50:36 send that send that voicemail
01:50:38 next week as well
01:50:40 yeah keep keep it coming keep it coming
01:50:42 uh if you know what I'm saying
01:50:44 uh next one
01:50:46 zinthus about poetry
01:50:48 3 2 1
01:50:50 yeah so like
01:50:52 6 years after finishing school I'm back
01:50:54 to reading and trying to recite poetry and shit
01:50:56 you're so fucking old dude
01:50:58 you're so fucking old
01:51:00 cause I had like this thought
01:51:02 isn't poetry like based
01:51:04 when you think about it
01:51:06 this primary mode of distribution
01:51:08 was oral or through newspapers
01:51:10 aka through the only
01:51:12 real mass media at the time it was
01:51:14 invented so in essence it was like
01:51:16 the only real
01:51:18 fast snappy disposable media
01:51:20 that could spread in a society in the past
01:51:22 what is
01:51:24 the modern equivalent of fast disposable
01:51:26 media that can spread like a disease in modern times
01:51:28 memes and youtube
01:51:30 videos exactly boys
01:51:32 what I'm saying is meme compilation
01:51:34 videos on youtube is the equivalent of
01:51:36 Edgar Allen Poe and Mikhail Minesko
01:51:38 fuck yeah
01:51:40 alright
01:51:42 alright I like your hustle
01:51:44 um
01:51:46 so poems were memes
01:51:50 memes are poetry I think
01:51:52 is the point
01:51:54 no I think
01:51:56 no I think that a
01:51:58 a poem could
01:52:00 express a meme like there might have been poetic
01:52:02 memes or so what we might consider memes
01:52:04 today like
01:52:06 well nursery rhymes
01:52:08 is that a form of poetry
01:52:10 or like a limerick or something right
01:52:12 yeah
01:52:14 like a joke
01:52:16 in poetry form like
01:52:18 the raven is not a meme

01:55:22 boy chris-chan
01:55:24 he was just like oh yeah
01:55:26 in anime sometimes people add chan

01:55:46 chris-chan

01:56:48 and let me tell you
01:56:50 let me tell you what's wrong
01:56:52 with the hispanic
01:56:54 oh no we're gonna lose all our South American viewers
01:56:56 of which there are actually quite a lot
01:56:58 the problem with Hispanic people
01:57:00 is that their names and addresses
01:57:02 are really fucking long
01:57:04 they're all really fucking long
01:57:06 they all are like four lines
01:57:08 and every line is like six words
01:57:10 it's like oh calle de la puente
01:57:12 de la puerta
01:57:14 de la sol
01:57:16 8 slash 12 slash 49
01:57:18 you know in
01:57:20 Puerto de las muertes
01:57:22 en las
01:57:24 Costa Rica
01:57:26 por favor
01:57:28 in Canada
01:57:30 or whatever
01:57:32 they're all like that
01:57:34 they're all fucking like that
01:57:36 and I don't care for it thank you very much
01:57:38 so fuck you
01:57:40 at least Jeff is only five
01:57:42 letters you piece of shit
01:57:44 thoughts?
01:57:46 prayers?
01:57:48 okay alright
01:57:50 it's really long
01:57:52 really fucking long names around those parts
01:57:54 okay next one
01:57:56 is from vintage
01:57:58 3 2 1
01:58:00 go
01:58:02 alright so I just want to correct
01:58:04 that samurai guy
01:58:06 who keeps calling him
01:58:08 at the end of every single one of his voicemails
01:58:10 he says until next time
01:58:12 Sayonara
01:58:14 Sayonara in Japanese
01:58:16 like
01:58:18 the kind of phrase you say
01:58:20 when you're expecting to not see someone again
01:58:22 or not expecting to see someone
01:58:24 for a really long time
01:58:26 it's like what people say when they're leaving
01:58:28 or like moving away
01:58:30 for many years
01:58:32 when they're not expecting to see someone for several months
01:58:34 they say Sayonara
01:58:36 the most common way to say
01:58:38 goodbye to someone who you're expecting to see again
01:58:40 is Jane
01:58:42 so yeah fuck you
01:58:44 fake samurai guy
01:58:46 damn
01:58:48 maybe the idea is that he says Sayonara
01:58:50 to trick you into thinking that you will never
01:58:52 see him again
01:58:54 but he says until next time
01:58:56 Sayonara
01:58:58 right?
01:59:00 you will never see me coming
01:59:02 until next time
01:59:04 maybe it's like
01:59:06 maybe it's like poetic irony
01:59:08 like
01:59:10 you know when I
01:59:12 betrayed my clan
01:59:14 and burned down the temple
01:59:16 and stole the sacred scrolls
01:59:18 or whatever, stashed them away and ran off
01:59:20 in the night
01:59:22 maybe like right before that
01:59:24 I said Jane
01:59:26 but I should have said Sayonara
01:59:28 and now he's saying it
01:59:30 right?
01:59:32 yeah
01:59:34 cause he's like yeah you get it
01:59:36 and I'm like oh I understand
01:59:38 I completely
01:59:40 I understood the symbolism all along
01:59:42 actually
01:59:44 I understood the message
01:59:46 but I pretended not to
01:59:48 to lull him into a false sense of security
01:59:50 and it didn't work
01:59:52 and I am being threatened
01:59:54 with sexual assault regularly
01:59:56 but you know
01:59:58 when some you lose some
02:00:00 um
02:00:02 but sayonara
02:00:04 thanks for the
02:00:06 kagebushi nojutsu scroll
02:00:08 I learned that
02:00:10 is that shadow clone?
02:00:12 does my Japanese
02:00:14 do my Japanese
02:00:16 education

02:00:28 and I got the one genjutsu
02:00:30 that like puts someone in like
02:00:32 fucking torture hell for a thousand years
02:00:34 in their minds eye
02:00:36 that was pretty good
02:00:38 that was the only two I know
02:00:40 wasn't that Bleach as well

02:00:44 I never watched Bleach
02:00:46 you know what I can't remember any of the names so I'm not even going to try
02:00:48 forget it
02:00:50 isn't it like

02:00:58 and then the on our team
02:01:00 science bad guy
02:01:02 with the weird war paint

02:01:24 he did some sort of
02:01:26 super science sword
02:01:28 attack thing
02:01:30 that fucked him up so that he
02:01:32 experiences
02:01:34 things
02:01:36 like extremely slow motion
02:01:38 such that it takes so long
02:01:40 for him to like to raise
02:01:42 his arm would feel like a thousand years
02:01:44 as passing and he's just sort of left
02:01:46 there stunned bummer
02:01:48 and then you know big bummer
02:01:50 sucks for him

02:02:14 and I just wanted to let you all know
02:02:16 that despite what your comments say a lot
02:02:18 this is by far the best
02:02:20 era of the pcp
02:02:22 I really love the low energy
02:02:24 chill episodes that just have
02:02:26 nice updates on everyone's life
02:02:28 wandering me and during conversations
02:02:30 and then
02:02:32 a voicemail box where everyone gets
02:02:34 played and anything can happen
02:02:36 this is by far the best time
02:02:38 I especially appreciate how
02:02:40 all of the people that have been appearing on the pcp
02:02:42 for the past few months have been the ones
02:02:44 that have reasonable
02:02:46 humane politics
02:02:48 going back and listening to some of the older episodes
02:02:50 are just dog shit
02:02:52 hearing people's
02:02:54 just completely insane
02:02:56 and uh
02:02:58 inhuman takes

02:05:48 I put a stamp on some paperwork
02:05:50 and I like you know put it in a box
02:05:52 and then I just I don't remember
02:05:54 you know that was like that was like weeks ago
02:05:56 you know
02:05:58 somebody went to ben people go to jail all the time
02:06:00 I can't remember
02:06:02 I can't remember every single one of these people
02:06:04 you've been sending goons to beat him up every week
02:06:06 oh more goons
02:06:08 um yeah
02:06:10 I mean sure

02:06:16 these people okay alright
02:06:18 um listen
02:06:20 uh
02:06:22 I don't know how you found the sacred scroll
02:06:24 for murder origami
02:06:26 uh um
02:06:28 but uh
02:06:30 you know
02:06:32 it's win-win for me either sensei
02:06:34 takes you out or you take him out you know one or the other
02:06:36 so you know
02:06:38 it's just a bunch of bullshit I don't have to put up with anymore
02:06:40 uh you know I'm excited
02:06:42 that's pretty good this word's good for me
02:06:44 alright there we go alright things are looking up
02:06:46 uh
02:06:48 bass okay
02:06:50 next one two things
02:06:52 three two one go
02:06:54 alright so I've got two things to say
02:06:56 um
02:06:58 last week
02:07:00 you were wondering if my voicemail
02:07:02 title
02:07:04 title centrist voicemail
02:07:06 was a joke and uh
02:07:08 no it's not a joke
02:07:10 and secondly
02:07:12 uh I don't think we should free the nipple
02:07:14 because uh women
02:07:16 uh they're gross they're yucky
02:07:18 and I don't want to look at them and um
02:07:20 mm-hmm
02:07:22 uh yeah basically
02:07:24 sympathetic I mean
02:07:26 yeah
02:07:28 because they all look like that girl
02:07:30 they all look like that girl in the
02:07:32 freaking lefty girl gun squad
02:07:34 and I hate their face
02:07:36 and I don't want to see that shit
02:07:38 I think cover cover it up
02:07:40 they should they should invent
02:07:42 the reverse bikini where it shows
02:07:44 the nipple and it shows us everything else
02:07:46 hahahaha
02:07:50 now now we've got some big big
02:07:52 ideas going on over here now
02:07:54 there's a market for that I think
02:07:56 um
02:07:58 yes
02:08:00 enslave enslave the nipple
02:08:02 it's the opposite of free it right so
02:08:04 yeah yeah yeah
02:08:06 yoke it
02:08:08 like like as in like like an ox
02:08:10 like you would an ox
02:08:12 that would plow your field
02:08:14 for instance
02:08:16 um oh no I don't remember
02:08:18 what we were just what was happening
02:08:20 huh was that a voicemail did we
02:08:22 just hear a voicemail
02:08:24 Ben are you are you alright
02:08:26 Ben why is it every episode there's
02:08:28 something dangerously wrong with you
02:08:30 wait wait
02:08:32 we just listen to a voicemail yes
02:08:34 what yeah it was it was two things
02:08:36 and it was the guy who was the centrist and wait what
02:08:38 what did he say he said that the last one
02:08:40 was not a joke yeah it was
02:08:42 serious and the second free the nipple
02:08:44 shouldn't free the nipple because girls are gross
02:08:46 we were just that was
02:08:48 not like something that we stopped talking about
02:08:50 you literally just finished the sentence
02:08:52 yeah I know I know it's not my fault
02:08:54 like it's not my fault it wasn't even attention
02:08:56 this is what happens when you're on keto for like
02:08:58 a year straight you turn into this
02:09:00 no no your brain your body

02:09:16 your brain is like hey thanks

02:09:20 anytime anytime pal
02:09:22 okay alright
02:09:24 alright hey what was that voice
02:09:26 don't we just listen to
02:09:28 shut up
02:09:30 next one is slime season
02:09:32 sounds pretty cool
02:09:34 in my opinion
02:09:36 three two one go
02:09:42 hey buster do you like in this war
02:09:44 do you ever wish new los angeles
02:09:46 aka new milwaukee was a real physical city
02:09:48 you could explore
02:09:50 in minecraft
02:09:52 come join the pcp minecraft server
02:09:54 we've ripped a map from crackasy.net
02:09:56 and using advanced slime technology
02:09:58 we ported it into minecraft
02:10:00 as a 600 by 1000 block floor plan
02:10:02 to build an accurate massive
02:10:04 slime city now we're sitting
02:10:06 up streets and buildings starting with
02:10:08 downtown knackillic
02:10:10 so all your rough houses and cup kids
02:10:12 come on down and get sweaty
02:10:16 whoa what the fuck
02:10:18 I don't even I can't even
02:10:20 I can't even imagine what that would look like
02:10:22 I think I don't have to imagine much longer
02:10:24 apparently
02:10:26 I haven't seen it but I have heard that yes
02:10:28 maron pan has
02:10:30 ported the map of endless war
02:10:32 that doesn't even make sense
02:10:34 into like the floor plan
02:10:36 what the city would like the structure
02:10:38 the district shapes
02:10:40 and then I guess
02:10:42 is inviting people to build the city
02:10:44 on the map I think
02:10:46 that's on the pcp minecraft
02:10:48 server which you can get on
02:10:50 with the well the link
02:10:52 that's certainly
02:10:54 that's a fucking that's a fucking
02:10:56 that's a yeah link in the description
02:10:58 that's fucking weird um I guess
02:11:00 I guess there's no reason not to mention now
02:11:02 I was gonna bring this up after the episode
02:11:04 but I think
02:11:06 I think we should do a shackles for heckles
02:11:08 this week
02:11:10 probably before this episode even comes out I don't know
02:11:12 I'm thinking maybe Wednesday
02:11:14 maybe we do it Wednesday this week
02:11:16 Wednesday was for me
02:11:18 the Wednesday before you are listening
02:11:20 to this viewer
02:11:22 um yeah I was gonna bring it up I wanted
02:11:24 to do one this week uh I don't know
02:11:26 maybe Wednesday we'll see but I'll
02:11:28 I'll fucking add everyone or something
02:11:30 I don't know
02:11:32 and I mean
02:11:34 hey that's interesting we can check that out
02:11:36 and I can you know
02:11:38 train up my fucking contrary malamar
02:11:40 a little bit more because that's pretty
02:11:42 that's pretty good shit
02:11:44 I was gonna find like a goal to have
02:11:46 in the pcb minecraft server because when I go on
02:11:48 I'm like I don't know
02:11:50 if I see a cute pokemon I have to get it
02:11:52 and then I have it and I look at it
02:11:54 but I don't really do anything
02:11:56 my goal is to have a good team
02:11:58 and I was like but I have to
02:12:00 play the game
02:12:02 yeah I mean it's hard it's really hard
02:12:04 um
02:12:06 because like you have to actually go get them
02:12:08 which is like I usually just fucking build shit
02:12:10 I'm fucking
02:12:12 on showdown that's how I beat munchie
02:12:14 slime fest I just fucking like hit some buttons
02:12:16 on the pokemon over there I didn't have to do anything
02:12:18 um
02:12:20 dude was that the last slime fest
02:12:22 ever
02:12:24 well I mean I don't know about ever

02:13:04 custom monopoly with
02:13:06 like little pieces
02:13:08 that are 3d models made of
02:13:10 multiple endless war characters
02:13:12 I will show you a screenshot just so
02:13:14 you can get an idea
02:13:16 of what we were talking about smearg made
02:13:18 all of this stuff in I don't know
02:13:20 what program she used but like
02:13:22 probably blender yeah it's
02:13:24 it's like a game it's the game and it's got
02:13:26 a whole deck of cards I saw it's fucking
02:13:28 sick it's all these pieces it's got
02:13:30 the statue in the middle there's all these
02:13:32 there's more than just these but like this is just what's on
02:13:34 like one corner of the board um
02:13:36 I don't know I still I'm still
02:13:38 not over how good it is that's really cool
02:13:40 um yeah yeah it's really great
02:13:42 um but uh yeah
02:13:44 and then and then after that you know we had
02:13:46 slime fest and you know
02:13:48 crushed it
02:13:50 undefeated for five five
02:13:52 wins no losses I am
02:13:54 I am the pokemon master
02:13:56 um maybe
02:13:58 of all the like three

02:14:02 in pokemon battles in rfck I
02:14:04 have won them all
02:14:06 um be doopity
02:14:08 and then I beat his dad munchie
02:14:10 and now this is very
02:14:12 a ghost spin
02:14:14 around
02:14:16 oh
02:14:18 wait where did this come
02:14:20 from uh smearg
02:14:22 posted it a while ago before
02:14:24 all the slime monopoly and I saved this this
02:14:26 little spinny I should
02:14:28 I should go look for I should go look for the
02:14:30 other ones because this is really nice this is really
02:14:32 cool um
02:14:34 um
02:14:36 wait how do we get on this topic
02:14:38 I was the the
02:14:40 slime season
02:14:42 oh yeah I was I was just gonna
02:14:44 say yeah if we do uh
02:14:46 shackles for heckles you can scope that out I'm very
02:14:48 curious
02:14:50 like is it
02:14:52 is it just kind of like the map
02:14:54 sort of recreated in blocks on the ground
02:14:56 I don't know
02:14:58 we're gonna we're gonna have to go to the
02:15:00 stream and find out all
02:15:02 I'm just imagining like like to build
02:15:04 to build like a city on top of it
02:15:06 it would have to be huge like to build
02:15:08 like a disc like to build buildings
02:15:10 in each of the individual districts
02:15:12 because there's like what is like 33
02:15:14 districts I think
02:15:16 and like to put stuff
02:15:18 in each one I don't know I'm curious
02:15:20 okay well I'll have to I'll have to scope it out
02:15:22 it's quarantine these people
02:15:24 all have the time so that's true
02:15:26 that's true I don't know but everyone's
02:15:28 going back to school though
02:15:30 everyone's going back to school
02:15:32 just all
02:15:34 about a zoom and fucking
02:15:36 lining away
02:15:38 yeah yeah you're right
02:15:40 fuck it
02:15:42 um
02:15:44 alright awesome
02:15:46 awesome uh last one this is
02:15:48 the last voicemail I told you we'd blast through
02:15:50 them uh prol
02:15:52 jester
02:15:54 three two one go
02:16:00 kitty dinkity
02:16:02 dickity deck
02:16:04 are we still pretending the social
02:16:06 contracts in effect
02:16:08 the police don't serve us
02:16:10 and money trumps reason
02:16:12 but is violence
02:16:14 an answer
02:16:16 or truly high treason
02:16:18 he he
02:16:20 oh oh
02:16:22 he
02:16:24 solve my riddle
02:16:26 all present
02:16:28 I
02:16:30 feel like there's
02:16:32 that felt like it was there was going to be more
02:16:34 so it was uh
02:16:36 it was simple
02:16:38 what was he saying
02:16:40 I like this is the social contract
02:16:42 uh no one void
02:16:44 I think I think what he's saying is uh
02:16:46 a cab
02:16:48 oh
02:16:50 well good
02:16:54 right I read that right right
02:16:56 I I think that was part of what he was saying
02:16:58 yeah I'm going to
02:17:00 do it again this is nice
02:17:02 the social contract
02:17:04 has been broken because money
02:17:06 is more effective than
02:17:08 reason is is violence
02:17:12 the is is violence
02:17:14 good or is violence bad
02:17:16 answer good bricks
02:17:18 through windows please
02:17:20 is violence an answer to
02:17:22 the police
02:17:24 stuff
02:17:26 or is it high treason
02:17:28 or is he asking is police
02:17:30 or could he be is police violence
02:17:32 the answer or is it high
02:17:34 treason in which case it's bad
02:17:36 the problem with the rhymes leaves a lot of wiggle room
02:17:38 for interpretation I guess we could
02:17:40 I guess you could read that either way
02:17:42 um uh
02:17:44 I'm going to read it as
02:17:46 violence from us the people
02:17:48 which is good
02:17:50 because uh it's
02:17:52 we've you know because a cab
02:17:54 uh into
02:17:56 they don't pay attention
02:17:58 unless the bill unless a business burns
02:18:00 down Ha 하

02:18:10 and goofs and jabes and
02:18:12 riddles
02:18:16 uh that's
02:18:18 the end of the show
02:18:20 And on that note, burn down your local credit union, and then go to thepatreon.com slash
02:18:33 tpcrastinators.
02:18:34 It's The Procrastinators, tpcrastinators is the Twitter.
02:18:38 Jesus Christ, yeah, it's The Procrastinators for, you know, a million bonus episodes, a
02:18:45 whole fucking host of fucking backlog bonus episodes.
02:18:49 Too many to count.
02:18:50 Drowning, just drowning.
02:18:51 Literally too many.
02:18:52 I cannot tell you how many there are, because it surpasses human comprehension.
02:18:57 Are we going to mention that we missed one?
02:19:03 We did miss one this week, or this month.
02:19:05 Or we haven't done one yet, and we might just not do one this month.
02:19:09 There's still time.
02:19:10 There is still technically time.
02:19:11 Yeah, we could still get one out this month, and then do...
02:19:14 It could be fashionably late with the bonus episode.
02:19:16 We could, yeah, yeah, you know, we should.
02:19:21 We should still do one, even though we're a few days into them.
02:19:24 You're right.
02:19:25 You're right.
02:19:26 We should.
02:19:27 Okay, well, we don't have one yet, but we will hopefully get around to it.
02:19:32 I'm just saying, the more people who are waiting for the bonus episode, the more pressure and
02:19:37 incentive it'll put on us to actually make one this month.
02:19:40 So if you want a bonus episode, get your friends to sign up for $5 a month, and then we'll
02:19:45 feel more obligated to do it.
02:19:47 So, you know, everybody wins.
02:19:49 We will only do the bonus episode if 10 people become patrons.
02:19:54 If we get 10,000 likes.
02:19:57 Yeah, hmm, yeah, hmm, die.
02:20:02 Leave a speakpipe at speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail.
02:20:08 If you want to get in on the Anarchy, anything goes.
02:20:11 There's no quality control.
02:20:13 There's no floor.
02:20:14 There's no skill floor at all on this shit anymore.
02:20:18 It's all been removed.
02:20:19 The guardrails are gone.
02:20:21 We took the bumpers out of the gutters on our on our week weekend bowling trip.
02:20:26 I feel like balls are like rolling the the the bumpers have gone up because now like
02:20:32 even if you're crap, you're still get in where oh yeah, you're down.
02:20:38 You'd have to be good.
02:20:39 We laid down a big old we put the training wheels back on, you know, it's all it's all
02:20:44 bumper in fact like like imagine the bowling alley and instead of just bumpers in the gutters,
02:20:49 the bumpers extend like all the way into the middle, right, just a straight path, a narrow
02:20:53 path on the middle of the strike.
02:20:55 Just like pitch the bowling ball with inhuman strength that are still ricochet off the walls
02:21:00 where it's supposed to go.
02:21:01 Have I ever mentioned that I knew a guy one time who bold like Fred Flintstone?
02:21:08 Like he no, he did.
02:21:11 He had he he would use the lightest ball and he it was like a skinny this was like a skinny
02:21:17 tall guy and he would with glasses and stuff he was like a nerd and he would like hold
02:21:22 the ball and he would like slowly kind of like creep towards the line and then instead
02:21:27 of like a swing, he would just kind of like jerk his arm out from his chest where he was
02:21:32 holding the ball to and kind of twist it in the air and it would like thunk.
02:21:38 It would go out and then arc and thunk on the on the floor and then it would like slowly
02:21:43 roll and he he pulled like a fucking he pulled like a 270 he pulled like literally the best.
02:21:51 I haven't seen that much bowling but he pulled like one of the best games I've ever seen.
02:21:55 This guy was like really good and he had the most bizarre fucking technique that I've ever
02:22:00 seen.
02:22:01 Okay, this had to get my bowling anecdote in there before the end of the episode.
02:22:07 Every time for it.
02:22:09 Yep.
02:22:10 Patreon, Twitter, Speakpipe, Minecraft River, well yeah, you do all this PCP related stuff
02:22:18 and then go to twitch.tv slash Gibbentech to watch me draw a manga because that's cool.
02:22:24 That's what I do.
02:22:25 Wait, you're not done with that?
02:22:26 I'm doing another issue.
02:22:28 That's why I said he was a golden god.
02:22:30 Oh god.
02:22:31 Yeah.
02:22:32 Wait, is this, is this, okay, is this like you finished the part for the Tezuka and
02:22:37 you got to finish the rest, right?
02:22:38 And now he's doing more.
02:22:40 I'm finishing the rest.
02:22:41 Right, okay.
02:22:42 I'm doing it all.
02:22:43 Okay, okay, okay, I see.
02:22:45 Yeah, yeah, do that.
02:22:46 No, I can't, I can't, I can't argue with that.
02:22:49 You should probably go do that.
02:22:51 Too powerful.
02:22:52 All right.
02:22:53 Fuck yeah, we did it everyone.
02:22:55 Another episode.
02:22:56 Oh, oh, oh, and the Big Booby Mummy Milkers podcast.
02:22:59 There's not a podcast, it's not a podcast.
02:23:02 It's not a podcast.
02:23:03 Maybe there's a podcast.
02:23:04 Don't join, don't join the server.
02:23:07 You know what you should do?
02:23:08 Squeeze, jiggle, squirt.
02:23:10 If you're not sure if you're someone who's been on the sidelines and hearing all this
02:23:15 stuff about endless war and you're like, ah, sounds kind of gay.
02:23:18 You should go to the Big Booby Mummy Milkers server and be like, hey, this isn't gay at
02:23:23 all.
02:23:24 And, and then it can be like your gateway drug to endless war.
02:23:28 You can be like, now they're just going to steal all your thunder because they're going
02:23:30 to do the, the, the, the maybe slime.
02:23:33 A hundred percent, a hundred percent, always effective method.
02:23:37 Just take something, put tits on it, triple your income instantly.
02:23:41 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it cannot be.
02:23:45 It cannot be.
02:23:48 We'll see.
02:23:49 We'll see how it pans out.
02:23:51 Impossible.
02:23:52 Impossible.
02:23:53 Um, by the way, this is, um, actually today, this Friday, yeah, Friday, I will be judging
02:24:01 on, you know, maybe late later tonight after that whole fucking manga thing, uh, twitch.tv
02:24:05 slash rattyfuckers cop killers.
02:24:08 I think unless, unless it gets postponed for some reason, I will be judging the war on
02:24:14 quickville contest, uh, the latest art contest from rattyfuckers cop killers, where it's
02:24:20 about draw a fucking waging war on quickville in retaliation for the slime or for the bicarbonate
02:24:26 soda rain.
02:24:27 Uh, so that should be funny, assuming, assuming there's good entries, uh, uh, I don't know,
02:24:32 remains to be seen.
02:24:33 All the good ones usually come in at the last minute, so I guess we'll see.
02:24:36 Uh, yes, good, good, all this fucking, all these commands.
02:24:40 All right.
02:24:41 Are we done?
