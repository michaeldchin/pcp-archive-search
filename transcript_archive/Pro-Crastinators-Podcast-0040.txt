00:00:00 Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:28 We are back again to talk about cool things that we like because we have the ability to
00:00:33 do so.
00:00:34 I am the best guy ever, and I'm joined today by Hippocrit.
00:00:39 Yes, I got alcohol today.
00:00:43 Good job.
00:00:44 We've got Lethal Aurora Mage.
00:00:45 I did not get any water, I'm sad.
00:00:49 Seen Agua.
00:00:50 I think that was Italian.
00:00:51 Anyway, Mumkey Jones.
00:00:53 I already have to pee.
00:00:58 I still need a bigger hard drive for my PS4.
00:01:02 That's my most pressing concern right now.
00:01:05 We all had liquid things, and you had a PS4 thing, you broke it.
00:01:10 It's turning my brain to liquid distress, knowing I only have 80 gigs left on my hard
00:01:16 drive.
00:01:17 It's a problem.
00:01:19 So our topic for today is, as it's the end of the year, we're going to talk about all
00:01:24 the celebrities who died in Toy Shots.
00:01:26 No, we're not doing that.
00:01:27 We're not doing that.
00:01:28 They deserved it.
00:01:30 They deserved it.
00:01:31 Those alt-right fucks.
00:01:33 No, we're going to talk about what we're looking forward to in 2017, and our goals.
00:01:39 I'm thinking about specific goals.
00:01:40 I got plans for 2017.
00:01:42 I'm going to make that year my bitch, and it's going to be good.
00:01:45 But before we get into that, just one little piece of news from the 2016 year I would like
00:01:51 to announce that we have officially brought into the fold of the procrastinators, Monkey
00:01:56 Jones is now an official PCP TPC guy round of applause.
00:02:00 Yay!
00:02:01 I did it.
00:02:02 I was autistic enough.
00:02:03 Yeah, you did.
00:02:04 Just barely.
00:02:05 Yo.
00:02:06 Just barely.
00:02:07 I hope one day I can reach the levels of autism that the rest of you aspire to.
00:02:11 Well, you've got a couple of children's cartoons to make your way through before you get to
00:02:16 that point.
00:02:17 That's true.
00:02:18 So who's got some resolutions that they want to shoot out?
00:02:21 Not fucking resolutions.
00:02:22 I'm talking about goals.
00:02:23 Resolutions are for the queers.
00:02:24 That's true.
00:02:25 I'm talking about action plans.
00:02:26 You know?
00:02:27 Action drafts.
00:02:28 That's what I'm all about.
00:02:29 Action draft.
00:02:30 He's my coach.
00:02:31 He's my life coach, actually.
00:02:32 Well.
00:02:33 And he's keeping me on track.
00:02:34 I have a couple plans.
00:02:35 A couple different plans.
00:02:36 Sure.
00:02:37 Let's hear them.
00:02:38 Obviously, there's Radcon, which is going to be fun, and there's going to be-
00:02:40 One week, baby.
00:02:41 One week.
00:02:42 Oh, shit.
00:02:43 Yeah.
00:02:44 Oh, fuck.
00:02:46 I should probably tell somebody that I'm leaving this day.
00:02:49 That's true.
00:02:50 Me, too.
00:02:51 Nobody knows.
00:02:54 Well, yeah, there's Radcon.
00:02:55 Nobody knows what it's like to go to Radcon.
00:02:59 Okay, I'm sorry.
00:03:00 Except for all of us.
00:03:01 Except for us.
00:03:02 Except for us.
00:03:03 I think you're all antagonizing me.
00:03:05 Oh, no.
00:03:06 I'm sorry.
00:03:07 Paige, we love you.
00:03:08 You got so much help, Paige.
00:03:09 You're not going either.
00:03:10 We'll have Radcon.
00:03:12 Oh, true.
00:03:13 London at some point.
00:03:15 Yeah.
00:03:16 Oh, man.
00:03:17 If we could get another Kickstarter thing going on, to fly us out to London like the
00:03:20 K-On! Girls, and we can go on a fucking tour, how fucking ill would that be?
00:03:25 That would be so cool.
00:03:28 I mean, did you-
00:03:29 I feel like you could probably pull it off.
00:03:31 He made this happen, which is beyond what I expected.
00:03:34 Yeah, man.
00:03:35 Clearly, his fans are as gullible as they are rich.
00:03:39 Yeah, fuck you guys.
00:03:41 Okay, anyway.
00:03:42 I'm sorry, Gib.
00:03:43 Let's hear your shit.
00:03:44 But for personal stuff, I have-
00:03:47 I made a tweet that I wanted to get a bunch of things started.
00:03:51 I want to start, you know, I don't expect to finish all these things, but I expect to
00:03:56 at least manage to start writing a novel, developing a game, making an album, and something
00:04:03 else, making a comic.
00:04:04 I don't know.
00:04:05 Please tell me it's a rock opera.
00:04:06 I want to start all those things, and that is-
00:04:08 Okay.
00:04:09 That is my overall goal is to begin them all.
00:04:12 What were you saying, Momkey?
00:04:14 I said, please tell me it's a rock opera that you want to make.
00:04:18 It is probably going to be a rock album, because that's the music I like.
00:04:22 There could be an opera in that.
00:04:24 Rock opera is the best genre.
00:04:26 Comedy rock's good, too.
00:04:28 Because I can't really do serious singing, so that'll be-
00:04:35 We're just living in a generation immersed in irony all the time.
00:04:38 I can't be serious anymore.
00:04:41 It's real hard.
00:04:42 It's real bad.
00:04:43 We've lost the ability to be sincere.
00:04:45 That's our coping mechanism for the bullshit that we have to put up with.
00:04:50 None of it's real.
00:04:51 None of it matters.
00:04:52 Let's just-
00:04:53 We're all going to die someday.
00:04:55 Yeah, we're all going to die.
00:04:56 They used to go out and kill their enemies, but our only resource now is to just sink
00:05:00 into irony and just-
00:05:01 Our only resource now is memes.
00:05:03 Yeah, that's what we've got left.
00:05:05 These are the weapons our fathers gifted to us.
00:05:07 The only thing we're killing is our future as a goddamn millennia.
00:05:11 Oh, such depression.
00:05:13 Here we come, 2017.
00:05:15 Such edgy depressness.
00:05:18 Hey, Bo, do you have any goals for your YouTube channel?
00:05:23 Yes, I want to get to a point while I'm thinking of doing all these other things.
00:05:29 I want to-
00:05:30 Obviously, I want to finish the Rayman video, and I want to do Ratchet and Clank 2 review.
00:05:37 But I have a goal that I don't know whether I'll actually get there by the end of 2016,
00:05:44 but I'll be working towards it the whole year, is just making it so that I always have a
00:05:49 video coming up the next week.
00:05:51 So whether it's a miniscule review or a big review or a GRPJ, I want something to be coming
00:05:56 out the week, you know, before, you know, just scheduled a bunch of shit so that I never
00:06:02 have to be like, oh shit, I got to make something in two days or else I'm fucked.
00:06:06 Backlog dream goal, that's it.
00:06:12 Now, do you see that as- I mean, I don't mean to be critical about it.
00:06:18 Do you see that as like a dream goal, or is this something that you have a plan to achieve?
00:06:23 Well, I say it's a dream goal, but it is a plan.
00:06:26 I'm going to work towards doing that.
00:06:29 That's why I say it's a plan for the next year.
00:06:31 My dream goal is to be rich and have no problems at all.
00:06:34 But, you know, I can't do that next year.
00:06:36 That'll be like 2019.
00:06:38 Well, that's- 2019 is really weird to say.
00:06:41 I don't like it.
00:06:43 2019?
00:06:44 Just think a few years ago, 2017 was weird to say.
00:06:47 I don't know, 2017 sort of rolls over.
00:06:50 2019 sounds like you're counting down.
00:06:52 It was going to be fun to say 2020 though.
00:06:54 Yes, I'll be looking forward to that.
00:06:56 Oh man, everyone's going to be seeing real clearly that.
00:06:58 No, I knew somebody would say that.
00:07:00 I made a tweet about how everybody is going to be saying,
00:07:04 I have 2020 vision or some sort of joke like that.
00:07:07 Oh yeah, that's the one.
00:07:10 I've got 2020 vision for when we get that fucking racist massages
00:07:15 Trump out of office, if you know what I'm saying.
00:07:17 But like, no, the joke was like,
00:07:20 people every single day in 2020 will be saying,
00:07:23 like if someone asks them,
00:07:25 hey, when do we do the thing or what's happening tomorrow?
00:07:28 They say, gee, guys, I don't have 2020 vision.
00:07:31 They ask me if what's happening right now?
00:07:34 Gee, it's stupid and it's going to happen.
00:07:38 I'm probably going to have to get glasses in the next couple of weeks.
00:07:41 I need to get my eyes checked, so I can't wait for that to happen.
00:07:44 And then I'm just like, no, I don't have 2020 vision.
00:07:46 Look at my fucking face.
00:07:47 Fuck you.
00:07:48 Get that joke out of here.
00:07:49 It's racist.
00:07:50 You know, I need new glasses too.
00:07:52 Ever since Radcon won, actually at Radcon,
00:07:55 I like dropped my glasses that I wear occasionally
00:07:58 and I broke like a half of them.
00:08:00 And then sometime later, the other half broke.
00:08:02 So now I've just, I've been wearing taped glasses on both side.
00:08:05 I'm wearing them right now.
00:08:06 They just, they look like a fucking idiot.
00:08:08 And also, you guys probably don't know this.
00:08:10 I only learned this as I was experiencing it.
00:08:12 If you wear glasses, they probably have little rubber things
00:08:15 on the parts that go up over your ear.
00:08:17 If those fell off, as they have on both sides of my head now,
00:08:20 like there's nothing to hold the glasses kind of to your head.
00:08:23 And every time you move, they fly off your fucking face.
00:08:26 I'm wearing the most ghetto glasses of all time.
00:08:28 Okay, I don't need to get into a whole big thing about my glasses.
00:08:32 I need new ones.
00:08:33 My glasses.
00:08:34 Give, I had one more question about your plan.
00:08:36 And it was that I noticed that you said you wanted to start those various projects.
00:08:41 I was wondering if you had any kind of timeframe for when you were going to finish them.
00:08:45 Because I really don't enjoy having multiple projects running at once.
00:08:50 And what if that would be a challenge?
00:08:52 Starting them, you know what they say, like, it's easy to talk about,
00:08:58 you know, talk a big game, but never do anything.
00:09:00 If I have the projects begun, I can always say,
00:09:03 well, I tried, you know, and I want to have at least like a first draft
00:09:09 of a terrible story by the end of the year.
00:09:11 You know, nothing that I could put out,
00:09:13 maybe like half the story done.
00:09:15 You know, just get up to like DigiBro level writing
00:09:17 and you'll be pretty, you know, that's not acceptable,
00:09:19 but it's getting there, you're getting there.
00:09:21 Yeah.
00:09:22 And for the comic, I don't know, maybe draw a couple pages.
00:09:26 I don't really expect to do the comic, actually.
00:09:29 Comics are hard.
00:09:30 Oh, yes.
00:09:31 I was thinking that'd be like the one you're most likely to do.
00:09:33 Yeah, how hard could it be if Ben Seed does it?
00:09:35 Well, if I made the art deliberately not very intensive,
00:09:39 I guess I could do a comic.
00:09:41 It's just that drawing a square and then putting something in it
00:09:44 is always really annoying to me.
00:09:46 I don't know how big to draw the square.
00:09:47 I don't know what shape it should be.
00:09:49 So I would rather just draw everything in the same size square,
00:09:52 but then that doesn't look good on a page.
00:09:54 It's like, how do you, how do you do it?
00:09:56 I should just do a home stock.
00:09:57 This is my life hack to you for when I was doing comics.
00:09:59 You draw all the art and then you put it in panels afterwards.
00:10:03 That's interesting.
00:10:05 That's how I did all my comic pages like back in the day.
00:10:08 What program did you use to draw?
00:10:10 Um.
00:10:11 MS Paint.
00:10:13 That's the best program.
00:10:15 I used to draw it on it all the time and that's no joke.
00:10:19 But before I had internet.
00:10:21 That's how you get pro.
00:10:23 That's true.
00:10:24 But seriously, what program did you use?
00:10:27 Um, I was using Art Rage and Manga Studio.
00:10:31 I kind of jumped back and forth between both.
00:10:33 Art Rage.
00:10:34 I know it's so cringy, but it's good.
00:10:36 It's awesome.
00:10:37 I'm not cringing.
00:10:38 I'm loving it.
00:10:39 I want to get that shit.
00:10:41 Gib, did you have any other shit to say about your plans?
00:10:45 Or can we move on to someone who's actually interesting?
00:10:48 Whoa!
00:10:50 Got him!
00:10:53 We're all just going to talk about it.
00:10:57 We're just going to grind through all this shit and get all that stuff done.
00:11:01 We're just going to sit here jerking it all through 2017.
00:11:03 That'd be good.
00:11:05 I hope so.
00:11:06 I mean, let's get to my goals.
00:11:08 Jerking it.
00:11:09 That's my plan.
00:11:10 It's not even a goal.
00:11:11 I accomplished that with flying colors throughout 2016.
00:11:14 Yeah.
00:11:15 Yeah.
00:11:16 Just one color, though.
00:11:17 Just one flying color.
00:11:18 All the colors of the rainbow at once.
00:11:21 Oh, no.
00:11:22 I mean, with me, there's a little bit of red in there as well, you know, so it's, uh...
00:11:28 I'm sorry, Mage.
00:11:30 Help.
00:11:31 Why are you sorry?
00:11:32 I'll be your doctor.
00:11:33 Why are you sorry to me specifically?
00:11:35 I don't know.
00:11:36 Because he's a fucking beside who thinks you're a weak woman.
00:11:39 What are you saying?
00:11:40 You're saying you're a weak woman, Tom.
00:11:41 You're a bad person.
00:11:42 I mean, yeah, I am a bad person.
00:11:44 It's fine.
00:11:45 Oh, no.
00:11:46 Tom is a good person.
00:11:48 Oh, God.
00:11:49 We're off the fucking rails.
00:11:51 What's...
00:11:52 Gabe, I'm sorry.
00:11:53 Were you done?
00:11:54 Was there anything else?
00:11:55 If I was going to say something, I forgot it, so forget it.
00:11:59 Okay.
00:12:00 You can bring it up later anyway.
00:12:01 Gabe, I think your resolution should be to tell Nate and myself when we cut you off
00:12:04 to just shut the fuck up when we do the show.
00:12:06 That's a good goal.
00:12:07 That is a good goal.
00:12:08 That is a good goal.
00:12:09 Shut up, Nate.
00:12:10 Thank you.
00:12:11 You asshole.
00:12:12 There we go.
00:12:13 There we go.
00:12:14 Oh, it's only 2016.
00:12:15 It doesn't count.
00:12:17 That's true.
00:12:18 You can't do it yet.
00:12:19 You can't do it yet.
00:12:20 Just get in practice.
00:12:21 It's fine.
00:12:22 How about you, Tom?
00:12:23 What are your goals for 2017?
00:12:24 I have a few, I guess.
00:12:27 So I want to start writing my book.
00:12:31 I've already started writing some stuff for it.
00:12:34 Good.
00:12:35 I'm hopefully going to put the first part out in the next three or four days, I think.
00:12:41 Wow.
00:12:42 All right.
00:12:43 How long is it going to be?
00:12:45 Well, it's combined.
00:12:46 I think it's just under 20,000 words because there's a prologue and then the first part.
00:12:50 It's pretty fucking good.
00:12:51 I dropped both of those at the same time.
00:12:52 And then I want to do another part every two months.
00:12:55 So like six releases throughout next year, that's kind of the goal for that.
00:13:00 That's how Moby Dick was written.
00:13:02 Oh, really?
00:13:03 Yeah, it was like every fucking month he would release another 5,000 words or whatever the
00:13:08 hell.
00:13:09 Same shit with...
00:13:10 It was a little different, but fucking Christmas, fucking Charles Dickens, whatever the fuck.
00:13:15 Christmas story.
00:13:16 Christmas Carol?
00:13:17 No, not like...
00:13:18 Yeah, damn.
00:13:19 A Christmas Carol, yeah.
00:13:20 He was paid by the word.
00:13:21 What a champ.
00:13:22 He is a champ.
00:13:23 I'm sorry.
00:13:24 So what else?
00:13:25 That's exciting.
00:13:26 I'm looking forward to that.
00:13:27 Yeah, so that'll hopefully start in a few days.
00:13:29 I'm going to update the website to go with it.
00:13:34 I'm going to try and get more healthy, because my eating habits this year have been atrocious.
00:13:41 Like, there's a very normie goal, but I mean...
00:13:47 What's wrong with that?
00:13:48 Have you been not eating or just eating?
00:13:50 I mean, I'm so poor.
00:13:52 It's like, I could try and buy good food, but you know, Doritos are five for five dollars
00:13:57 right now, so that's just my life.
00:13:59 Play a bag of rice, dog.
00:14:01 Big ol' bag of rice.
00:14:03 Yeah, I've actually started doing intermittent fasting.
00:14:06 Why didn't you go full weave and make rice balls?
00:14:10 I mean, I could.
00:14:11 Jelly filled doughnuts.
00:14:12 Yeah.
00:14:13 I mean, I got...
00:14:14 I'm just going to eat nothing but jelly doughnuts all next year.
00:14:17 Dude, why are you doing intermittent fasting?
00:14:19 You're already a skinny boy.
00:14:20 What's the deal?
00:14:21 Well, it's because usually I have this bad habit of I'll eat like one or two meals,
00:14:28 and then like right before bed, I'll just engorge on more stuff because I'm bored.
00:14:32 So I'm kind of like trying to force myself not to do that,
00:14:34 because that's like the worst time to eat stuff.
00:14:36 And it's definitely like...
00:14:37 Hey, you know, I actually...
00:14:38 I was reading about that.
00:14:39 It's that there's...
00:14:40 Let's just say at best there's inconclusive evidence that eating right before sleeping
00:14:44 actually contributes to, you know, like fat gain or anything.
00:14:48 I feel like...
00:14:49 I'm just saying...
00:14:50 My personal experience and looking at my scale tells me that there's definitely some sort
00:14:55 of at least personal biological correlation.
00:14:58 All right, fair enough.
00:14:59 It makes kind of sense though, especially like if what you eat before bed is something
00:15:04 like sweet and sugary and stuff, and that's really bad.
00:15:06 Okay, we're talking about how like we feel that our bodies are doing it as opposed to
00:15:11 the statistics.
00:15:12 I'm just saying let's...
00:15:14 Well, statistically, if you only eat eight hours a day and you're fasting for 16, your
00:15:19 body goes into ketosis longer and burns your fat reserves, and that's my mindset behind
00:15:24 doing intermittent fasting.
00:15:25 Okay, okay.
00:15:26 So you eat within an eight hour window, and then 16 hours, eight hours being awake, and
00:15:30 then eight hours while asleep.
00:15:32 Ideally, your body's not eating anything, and it's just burning your reserves.
00:15:36 That's the idea behind that.
00:15:38 Yeah, okay, all right.
00:15:40 I also read that you're supposed to eat sweets before the actual dinner, because sweets are
00:15:47 easily stored in the body and they become fat, but if you eat them first, they're going
00:15:51 to be used up, the energy, and your body can just digest the food at its normal pace.
00:15:59 So my mom's wrong this whole time, and you are supposed to have dessert first.
00:16:02 Yeah, but the thing is, I think the reason people would say like, oh, you have to have
00:16:06 dessert last is so that little kids wouldn't ruin their appetite, because yeah, you should
00:16:11 eat the sweets first, but if you have nothing but sweets, that's also not good, you know?
00:16:16 And when you're growing up, you might want to eat a lot of sweets, and then you don't
00:16:19 feel like actually having the nice healthy dinner afterwards.
00:16:23 So they're making sure that you eat the normal good food first before you eat any sweets.
00:16:28 True, sir.
00:16:29 Kids are very stupid.
00:16:31 That's true.
00:16:32 Then again, so am I, because I'm still a man-child.
00:16:36 Okay, so beyond your dieting goals, what else you got?
00:16:39 I might finally quit YouTube.
00:16:40 Who knows?
00:16:41 That's definitely in the cards.
00:16:42 Whoa.
00:16:43 Yeah.
00:16:44 Why would you do that?
00:16:45 Because I hate YouTube.
00:16:46 It's like, it's a painful process.
00:16:49 I'm not going to start making things.
00:16:51 I might just like start blogging and just say, fuck YouTube, it's dumb, because I don't make
00:16:55 any Patreon money anymore like you guys do.
00:16:58 I make very little, but I found the most money that I've made online has been this month,
00:17:08 and this is a bad month, but through Amazon affiliate links, I've made more money this
00:17:12 month through that, then working my job, then Patreon, anything.
00:17:16 Wow, that's pretty good.
00:17:18 Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.
00:17:19 I mean, it's the holiday season, so I guess that's probably why.
00:17:22 Oh, true, true.
00:17:23 There's tablet things.
00:17:25 You sure you're not going to keep doing those, at least?
00:17:28 Well, I would, but nobody sends and responds to my emails anymore, so I can't get any.
00:17:34 Otherwise I'd still be doing them, but I keep, like there's two good ones that came out the
00:17:38 last like couple months.
00:17:39 I've been emailing both companies since October to be like, hey, gimme, and they're just like,
00:17:45 we're not responding to you, but they're not responding to anybody.
00:17:48 Nobody has any of these new tablets, so I get comments every day.
00:17:51 See, that's interesting.
00:17:52 Review this one, and nobody can, because nobody will give them away anymore.
00:17:56 It's like, well, now you got to buy them, and I'm just like, no, I don't.
00:17:59 I'm just not going to do it, so no one will buy them.
00:18:02 You fools.
00:18:04 I don't know.
00:18:05 I've been doing a lot of research on actual blogging, and apparently people can still
00:18:11 make money doing that, and that's kind of cool, and that takes less effort.
00:18:15 I think YouTube is a clusterfuck anyways.
00:18:17 It's like turning into this not bad environment, but there's just a lot of bullshit going on
00:18:24 with YouTube right now in general that I'm not a huge fan of.
00:18:26 You ain't wrong about that.
00:18:30 I did a couple videos the last couple weeks talking about, like,
00:18:33 how YouTube's a clusterfuck, and then how YouTube alternatives that people are talking
00:18:37 about aren't going to work, and then the third one's going to be like the social network
00:18:40 that fixes it all, and I still haven't finished all the prep for it, but that'll hopefully
00:18:46 be going up in a couple days.
00:18:47 I might still just use YouTube for vlogs and supplemental content to boost the actual
00:18:52 blog, like do little videos here and there, but I can definitely, I can do more with
00:18:56 writing anyways, so I'm better at writing than anything else.
00:18:59 Maybe you could make live streams of videos.
00:19:02 You're self-typing the blog posts.
00:19:05 Let's do a Let's Type.
00:19:06 It's so good.
00:19:07 That's a great idea.
00:19:08 Let's blog.
00:19:09 Let's blog.
00:19:10 Yeah.
00:19:11 Yeah.
00:19:12 Watch me sit here.
00:19:13 So some major changes are coming for Tom Oliver, potentially.
00:19:15 Potentially.
00:19:16 I mean, it's kind of like one of those things I'm probably going to play with a bit and
00:19:19 see if it works, because if it's a dead end and I can't get anything out of there, then
00:19:23 I'm like, ah, fuck it.
00:19:25 I'm also possibly starting a new YouTube project, though, that I think would only work on YouTube,
00:19:32 because it's going to be another kind of review project.
00:19:34 I've mentioned it to you guys a little bit late to the party.
00:19:38 Late to the boy.
00:19:39 Oh, yeah.
00:19:40 Which sounded like a great idea, and we all liked it.
00:19:43 I mean, you know, if it makes sense economically, of course.
00:19:46 I mean, it seems like it wouldn't be too much of a burden to do, so I might try and shoot
00:19:54 for doing that for next year.
00:19:57 The reason I haven't started it yet is because my friend Ashley, she was going to do all the
00:20:01 editing because, like, fuck editing.
00:20:03 Oh, wow.
00:20:04 Okay, cool.
00:20:05 But then we were talking, and she's like, well, maybe I could do more than editing because
00:20:08 I kind of want to be in that.
00:20:09 I'm like, well, I don't know what you're like on camera, so we have to practice that and
00:20:14 see if we can get a good dynamic going.
00:20:16 And she hasn't gotten back to me on that.
00:20:18 That sounds like she just wants to be a YouTuber, but she doesn't have the confidence yet.
00:20:23 I don't really know.
00:20:24 She's trying to suck you off, dude, and not in the good way.
00:20:27 She's trying to lead you.
00:20:28 Oh, my God, did not intend to come out that way.
00:20:31 Dude, watch out.
00:20:33 That girl's trying to suck you off.
00:20:35 Get the fuck out of there.
00:20:36 I think I'll stay right here.
00:20:38 I'm sorry.
00:20:39 No.
00:20:40 I don't really know.
00:20:42 I mean, so depending on how that all goes, because we've been talking about, like, possibly
00:20:46 like, moving in and getting in place with her and our other mutual friends.
00:20:50 That's kind of why that conversation started.
00:20:53 But that might be delayed because I have to move out by August because that's something
00:20:58 big is going to change some of 2017 is I'm going to be losing my house.
00:21:03 Oh, yeah.
00:21:04 Wow.
00:21:05 Okay.
00:21:06 That's a change.
00:21:07 Yeah.
00:21:08 So I'm going to try and find a place to live.
00:21:10 So that's something I'm going to start working towards probably in the next week or so,
00:21:16 like, trying to get another second job so I can save up money to get out of here.
00:21:19 Oh, man.
00:21:20 Such a real person tongue.
00:21:22 It fucking sucks, dude.
00:21:24 Being a real person, it makes you want to die.
00:21:27 Yeah, but I mean, yeah, but it just makes me feel like such a sheltered little baby boy
00:21:34 when I'm like, oh, yeah, I can just live with my parents for a couple of years.
00:21:37 It's fine.
00:21:38 I mean, I've already done that.
00:21:40 I've been here since like 2012.
00:21:43 So I've paid my dues.
00:21:46 I'm just an older man.
00:21:47 So like I'm coming up on 30 and it's like, maybe it's time to stop being a little bitch
00:21:54 and be a real man and maybe I don't know if I can do it.
00:21:58 We're going to try and we'll see what happens.
00:22:01 That's another reason why I might have to just stop doing YouTube because like if I'm
00:22:05 like busting my ass like 60 hours a week and like possibly moving to like a shitty apartment
00:22:11 and it's like, oh, check out my awesome studio in the crack house down in, you know, wherever
00:22:16 the fuck I end up.
00:22:18 So I don't know.
00:22:19 It's going to be things are going to get super fucking different for me personally this year
00:22:24 or next year, depending on how you want to look at it, depending on when you're listening to this.
00:22:27 You have like a couple hours left of me saying this year.
00:22:29 Yeah, maybe did you will get it up instantly?
00:22:31 We'll say.
00:22:32 Sounded like he was busy with other shit tonight.
00:22:35 That's true.
00:22:36 He's busy getting drunk.
00:22:37 It's New Year's Eve.
00:22:38 Oh, did you have problems getting it up?
00:22:41 Here it is, folks.
00:22:43 I do have some bad news, everybody.
00:22:45 Oh, monkey's dead.
00:22:46 I just looked it up and I think I was wrong about Moby Dick being serialized.
00:22:51 Oh, no.
00:22:52 It's been bothering me for about 10 minutes now.
00:22:55 Well, isn't it like a super old book?
00:22:58 How would they?
00:22:59 How would that function?
00:23:00 It's from like 1851, I think.
00:23:01 Yeah.
00:23:02 And I thought King Critic got exposed for a hack today, but it turns out Monkey Jones.
00:23:07 That was pretty good.
00:23:08 I didn't know what you're talking about.
00:23:11 Check out Monkey Jones, too.
00:23:13 Some hot guys.
00:23:16 Okay.
00:23:17 Well, Tom, we are all excited and slightly concerned to see how things work out.
00:23:24 I'll let you know how I'm doing for my hardcore boss.
00:23:26 I'm sure we'll be in touch.
00:23:27 If all else.
00:23:28 Yeah.
00:23:29 Guys, go help Tom out, patreon.com.
00:23:31 Yeah, we'll make sure the money gets around, you know.
00:23:38 Mage, why don't you tell us what your plans are for the coming year?
00:23:43 You're a mysterious entity and the procrastinators.
00:23:46 No one knows.
00:23:47 Yeah.
00:23:48 Not even you.
00:23:49 Yeah, exactly.
00:23:50 I was just about to say that.
00:23:52 I'm living in a constant limbo.
00:23:56 I don't know what happened in the past.
00:23:58 I don't know what's going to happen in the future.
00:24:00 What am I doing now?
00:24:01 What is this?
00:24:02 Well, how do you not know what happens in the past?
00:24:04 She doesn't read the newspapers.
00:24:06 I forget.
00:24:07 I have such a bad memory.
00:24:09 I'm not just trying to be cute here.
00:24:11 I really do have really poor memory.
00:24:13 Oh, you can't help it, Mage.
00:24:14 You just can't help it.
00:24:15 Now can you?
00:24:16 Shadam.
00:24:17 Got him.
00:24:18 Anyway, I am going to try and fix up my health and stuff.
00:24:23 I've had a big scare recently with my health.
00:24:27 It was terrible.
00:24:28 I'm going to test.
00:24:29 I'm going to still have a stomach ultrasound soon.
00:24:33 That's called being pregnant.
00:24:35 No.
00:24:36 No, no, no.
00:24:37 Stomach.
00:24:38 It's a natural process, Mage.
00:24:39 It's in the stomach.
00:24:40 Yeah, when you're pregnant, the baby's in your tummy.
00:24:43 Stomach and tummy are two different things.
00:24:46 No, it's in your tummy.
00:24:48 My mommy told me so.
00:24:50 Stomach ultrasound.
00:24:52 Are you calling mom key a liar?
00:24:58 Guys, no.
00:25:00 You're on thin ice, Mage.
00:25:01 Be careful.
00:25:02 Don't even joke about it.
00:25:03 I don't want any kids.
00:25:06 That's like the worst joke I've ever had.
00:25:09 If you weren't slinging that thing around town, Mage, you wouldn't need to worry about it so much.
00:25:14 What, does she have like a three-foot clit or something?
00:25:21 Oh, God, why?
00:25:23 That's a mystery for the ages.
00:25:24 Guys, you're all gross.
00:25:25 You're all bad.
00:25:26 This is why I was apologizing earlier.
00:25:28 This is my PCP.
00:25:29 I'm kicking you all out.
00:25:30 Goodbye.
00:25:31 All right.
00:25:32 All right.
00:25:33 It's time for the Mage cast.
00:25:35 Okay, Mage.
00:25:36 But seriously, yeah, I'm going to fix my health up.
00:25:40 I was going to go to like some sort of health camp or whatever my mom was talking about it.
00:25:44 Me going there.
00:25:45 Health camp.
00:25:46 Yeah, health camp.
00:25:47 I'm going to starve myself for 10 days.
00:25:49 Starve yourself?
00:25:50 Is it a fat camp?
00:25:51 Are you going to fat camp?
00:25:52 No, no, no.
00:25:53 Okay.
00:25:54 All right.
00:25:55 To get stuff in order and stuff.
00:25:57 Oh, I see.
00:25:58 Yeah.
00:25:59 So I'll be needing to save up some months.
00:26:02 My mom said she would cover some of it, but she can't anymore because she has to have laser
00:26:06 eye surgery for both eyes.
00:26:08 Oh, wow.
00:26:09 Best news to find out on Christmas.
00:26:11 She's going to have laser eyes?
00:26:13 Yes.
00:26:14 She's getting them installed, dude.
00:26:16 Yeah.
00:26:17 My mom is going to be the best.
00:26:18 Very important.
00:26:19 Yeah.
00:26:20 Did you say you're going to starve yourself?
00:26:22 No, I'm not going to starve myself.
00:26:23 I'm going to go to this.
00:26:24 Constantly interrupting you.
00:26:26 Yes, exactly.
00:26:27 No, I just need questions for clarification.
00:26:29 That's what she said.
00:26:30 Well, I'm going to go to this camp and they're going to like strictly regulate what I'm eating
00:26:35 and what I'm doing with myself for the 10 days and whatever it's like.
00:26:38 I'm just saying it sounds like fat camp.
00:26:40 That's all I'm saying.
00:26:41 That's all I'm saying, guys.
00:26:42 Yeah.
00:26:43 I was going to say if you need to starve yourself, you can do it for free by going to Tom Oliver's
00:26:46 house.
00:26:47 I'll have you know that my pantry is packed to the brim with choice ramen, all right?
00:26:59 I've got all kinds of flavors.
00:27:01 Whatever you want.
00:27:02 I'll hook you up.
00:27:03 All the cardboard you can eat will be available.
00:27:05 I can eat that for Tom, guys.
00:27:08 I do too.
00:27:09 Patreon.com slash Ben St.
00:27:14 But yeah, I need to say up for whatever that camp thing, whatever it is.
00:27:19 My mom told me about it and like they all speak in Russian, so I have to go with her
00:27:23 because I don't speak a look of Russian.
00:27:25 Sometimes.
00:27:26 Does the name of this contain the word gulag at all?
00:27:29 You know, just wondering.
00:27:32 No, no.
00:27:33 It's actually in Latvia, but they all speak Russian because I don't know.
00:27:36 They probably speak Latvian too, but my mom can speak Russian, so there we go.
00:27:40 Oh, that's cool.
00:27:41 Yeah.
00:27:42 I would have spoken Russian too, but then at a young age, I decided to not.
00:27:46 So I don't speak Russian.
00:27:47 Oh, really?
00:27:48 You made a choice not to?
00:27:49 Yeah, well, yeah.
00:27:50 In school, you could have chosen like a third language.
00:27:53 The first one was Lithuanian.
00:27:55 Third language?
00:27:56 Yeah, first is Lithuanian, second was English, both mandatory, and then you had a choice.
00:27:59 What's the first one?
00:28:00 Lithuanian.
00:28:01 Lithuanian dog.
00:28:02 She's from Lithuania.
00:28:03 Yeah.
00:28:04 What the fuck is that?
00:28:05 Eastern Europe.
00:28:06 It's a European country.
00:28:07 Can you speak that language for me right now?
00:28:10 Oh, my dick is rock hard.
00:28:15 Yeah, dog.
00:28:17 Oh my god.
00:28:18 But yeah.
00:28:19 I legitimately forget sometimes that languages besides English and Japanese exist.
00:28:23 That's how much fucking disgusting we buy them.
00:28:27 Yeah, we had a choice between Russian, French, and German, and I already spoke a little bit
00:28:33 of German, so I went with German.
00:28:35 That's cool.
00:28:36 How's your German then?
00:28:37 Is it good?
00:28:38 It was decent back when I used it, but now it's probably rusty.
00:28:42 I probably understand a lot more than I can speak.
00:28:44 I couldn't hold a conversation honestly, but I can understand a lot more than I can speak.
00:28:50 That's cool.
00:28:52 Both languages, English and German, I was taught by cartoons.
00:28:57 Oh, so you said, so you said, where did you learn English again?
00:29:00 You've told me before.
00:29:01 Cartoons, Cartoon Network.
00:29:03 I'm just wondering if there's a specific one that stands out to you as a particularly
00:29:07 potential.
00:29:08 I was just watching cartoons in general on Cartoon Network all day, every day.
00:29:11 Well, not all day, but yeah.
00:29:13 Like a real American.
00:29:14 Like a real American.
00:29:15 Like a real American.
00:29:16 That's the laboratory, stuff like that.
00:29:19 Yeah.
00:29:20 Mage, I'm curious as to how you're going to make that money.
00:29:25 Because you don't, I mean, you occasionally make a, put an image on your deviant art that
00:29:30 I've seen, but I don't know really how you make money.
00:29:34 I haven't, yeah, I haven't been making money, per se.
00:29:37 I don't have a Patreon.
00:29:38 I haven't been concerned myself with making money, but I guess.
00:29:42 Welcome to European culture, everyone.
00:29:44 Not concerned about making money.
00:29:45 The state gives you everything.
00:29:47 Here's your health care.
00:29:48 Here's your food.
00:29:49 It's fine.
00:29:50 Here's a live in Muslim refugee.
00:29:52 Hey, hey, hey everybody.
00:29:54 I'm here.
00:29:55 I'm here too.
00:29:56 Hello.
00:29:57 Is the podcast on?
00:29:58 Yes.
00:29:59 I hope you're recording this shit.
00:30:00 I am recording this shit.
00:30:01 I was going to poke you because I saw you playing Pokemon.
00:30:04 It's like, how do you play Pokemon while we're here podcasting?
00:30:07 I forgot.
00:30:08 I forgot the podcast was starting.
00:30:10 Some nice fellow challenged me to a battle on the showdown.
00:30:14 How'd you do?
00:30:15 I defeated.
00:30:16 I crushed him.
00:30:17 Thank God.
00:30:18 I was real lucky.
00:30:19 I got Diggers B.
00:30:20 Ben's what?
00:30:21 That's the first guy.
00:30:22 I saw his dance and I swept half his team.
00:30:23 And then he told me that he loved my work and it really made my 2017.
00:30:25 Oh yeah.
00:30:26 Ben's won for 20 now.
00:30:28 All right.
00:30:29 We're working our way back up.
00:30:30 Yeah.
00:30:31 But I'm sorry.
00:30:32 Mage was telling us about her lifestyle, degenerate as it may be, but it is hers.
00:30:37 Okay.
00:30:38 But yeah, for 2017, I kind of really liked doing that little animation I did.
00:30:43 So I might actually put up more.
00:30:45 I have more fun spending several days drawing an animation that I do sitting down for an
00:30:50 hour and recording myself play Undertale.
00:30:52 As weird as that sounds.
00:30:53 Yeah.
00:30:54 It is.
00:30:55 It does seem a little more lucrative.
00:30:56 It's kind of amazing.
00:30:57 Actually, I have no idea.
00:30:58 Lucrative.
00:30:59 But it gets a lot of views.
00:31:00 I mean, you're Undertale videos.
00:31:02 I was going to say Undertale videos are big.
00:31:05 They are not small.
00:31:06 You guys mean her animations.
00:31:08 Of course.
00:31:09 Yeah.
00:31:10 Oh yeah.
00:31:11 All those.
00:31:12 Yeah.
00:31:13 No, I meant the Let's Play.
00:31:14 I haven't finished that one.
00:31:16 Yeah, the Let's Plays.
00:31:17 Yeah.
00:31:18 But yeah.
00:31:19 I just want to kind of do more.
00:31:20 They haven't gotten that many views.
00:31:22 As an American capitalist pig, I would advise you to drop the Let's Play.
00:31:26 Focus on animations of that kind.
00:31:28 The only thing is I want to finish that Let's Play at the same time.
00:31:32 I have more fun drawing stuff than I do.
00:31:35 Oh, God.
00:31:36 Please draw, Mage.
00:31:37 Please draw.
00:31:38 Fuck the Let's Play.
00:31:39 Nobody cares.
00:31:40 It's so true.
00:31:41 I'll consider it.
00:31:42 I kind of feel bad dropping it, like after, you know, just like procrastinating for half
00:31:46 a year and be like, hey, guys, I'm back and then one episode later.
00:31:49 Okay, guys, I'm quitting this Let's Play.
00:31:51 Just like, hey, guys, I'm back.
00:31:52 Die and have game over.
00:31:53 Just like, I guess the game's over.
00:31:55 Yeah.
00:31:56 There you go.
00:31:57 Sorry if my audio is, I'm using a new microphone and I just noticed that I'm clipping the fuck
00:32:02 out of my sandwich.
00:32:03 So sorry about that.
00:32:04 I'll try and adjust it.
00:32:05 Just don't shout and I think you'll be good.
00:32:07 Okay.
00:32:08 Yeah.
00:32:09 It's okay.
00:32:10 We've got Tom's audio, so we've got a bare minimum that we're still well above for the
00:32:13 rest of us.
00:32:14 As long as Whistler doesn't try to use hypnosis, Ben shouldn't be screaming.
00:32:18 Whistler, you know, scholars will debate.
00:32:22 Scholars will debate until the end of time whether Whistler really, whether Whistler just
00:32:26 made a mistake or whether he was an inside job, whether he was, whether he was, whether
00:32:30 he was your inside man.
00:32:32 But you know what?
00:32:33 It doesn't matter.
00:32:34 It doesn't matter whether it was intentional or not, you know, we can't, we can't stand
00:32:37 for that kind of thing.
00:32:38 Incompetence is even worse sometimes.
00:32:39 Do you think Whistler may be what, like he was, he was doing his hypnosis, but the fact
00:32:45 that it failed was because he was too busy whistling and waking him up.
00:32:49 I mean, I hope so.
00:32:51 Or he's a Whistler blower.
00:32:53 My, my friend, he's a whistleblower.
00:32:55 My friend Crack, my friend Crack drew a picture of Whistler getting ready for the firing squad.
00:33:00 He's got a bandana around his eyes.
00:33:02 Oh my God.
00:33:03 That shit.
00:33:04 I will go, yeah, he sent it to me on Patreon.
00:33:06 I will go and tweet it later.
00:33:07 Put that in the next episode at the end.
00:33:10 Oh yeah, that's right.
00:33:12 I am hungry for guest art.
00:33:14 I have had to do my own guest art a couple times.
00:33:17 I'm just thinking of the way Polyworld looks and he's got like the eye bumps that come out.
00:33:22 Would his eyes not have like an individual bow around each one?
00:33:30 Well, that's not how Crack chose to depict it.
00:33:33 Give us the big questions.
00:33:36 All right, Mage, was there anything else you wanted to add about, I'm curious if there's, yeah, please, go ahead.
00:33:41 Yeah, I kind of wanted to wrap it up.
00:33:43 Yeah, I think I'm going to do animations on my channel.
00:33:46 I'm thinking about maybe actually starting a Patreon.
00:33:50 I'm not too sure about that.
00:33:52 Do a dog.
00:33:53 It seems very fiddly and then I'll have to do extra stuff and I'm not really reliable.
00:33:57 You don't have to.
00:33:58 Dude, my Patreon has no rewards at all and I still make a pretty decent amount.
00:34:02 Most people do, but you don't have to.
00:34:04 Most people are suckers and they're chumps and I hate them.
00:34:07 Well, I mean, it's going to be their own choice.
00:34:10 It's not like I'm going to pressure them to do Patreon stuff, whatever.
00:34:13 Of course, otherwise they'd be right.
00:34:15 Yeah, I'll say about that.
00:34:17 I've been debating on whether or not to have Patreon for a while now, so I might do that.
00:34:22 Dude, we're the biggest pro-patreon people in the world here.
00:34:25 I don't see any reason to not do a Patreon ever.
00:34:28 It always seems like a good idea.
00:34:30 I mean, Christian Weston Chandler just started his successful Patreon.
00:34:33 And it's a rousing success.
00:34:34 $250,000 and he'll make you a 15 minute YouTube video.
00:34:39 About anything you want.
00:34:41 Yeah, anything you want.
00:34:42 Man, that's a bargain.
00:34:44 Okay.
00:34:45 I'm sorry, mate.
00:34:46 We are interrupting.
00:34:47 One last thing.
00:34:48 No, it's fine.
00:34:49 One last thing.
00:34:50 I might start doing commissions.
00:34:52 I'm still iffy about that because I'm not.
00:34:54 Like, I used to do pony commissions and ponies are really fun and kind of easy to draw.
00:34:58 But I want to, you know, start including like humans and stuff.
00:35:02 And I have big troubles with like anatomy of humans and I'm just like,
00:35:07 maybe I'll start off with Chibi's first and see how that goes.
00:35:10 So I might open up commissions soon.
00:35:13 I've been saying that for a while now, but I am legit thinking about it for serious
00:35:17 because I do need the months.
00:35:19 Weren't you doing some commissions earlier this year or like a month ago or so?
00:35:23 Yeah, I did some sort of private requests.
00:35:27 We kind of came about and I was like, well, I don't want to, you know, open up commissions
00:35:30 and have like a bunch of people commission me then I'll be overworked and I won't get
00:35:35 them done because I had to go for Christmas to my family and stuff.
00:35:39 So I did a few private ones that people asked me.
00:35:42 And yeah, and it turned out well.
00:35:44 And that's what kind of inspired me to maybe start actual commissions like public commissions.
00:35:49 Well, hey, if you do it, let us know and we'll shout it out.
00:35:54 I have never done like a round of commissions before.
00:35:59 I don't really like working on commissions, but I don't know.
00:36:03 It's practice in a way and hey, some way to earn months.
00:36:07 Yeah, yeah.
00:36:10 Who needs money when you live in Europe?
00:36:12 Am I right?
00:36:13 I do.
00:36:14 I do it for enough money, but frankly, I would feel uncomfortable asking for the amount of
00:36:18 money that would make me feel like that would make me feel like it was worth the pain and
00:36:22 suffering of doing someone's commission.
00:36:25 Yeah, I was doing commissions like a couple of months ago, but I was like thinking of
00:36:29 the pricing.
00:36:30 I'm like, no one's going to buy these.
00:36:31 Like I'm not going to like bother drawing your shitty OC for less than like $50 baseline.
00:36:36 Yeah.
00:36:37 Yeah.
00:36:38 And I mean, you know, people are so goddamn entitled on the internet.
00:36:41 They think artists should just draw them shit for free.
00:36:43 Dang it.
00:36:44 Well, it's just fucking lines on a paper, dude.
00:36:46 I have a system that I'm kind of happy with.
00:36:49 It's a little, I guess, you know, we achieve it at the same time.
00:36:52 I think it's good enough.
00:36:54 I charge by the hour and so the effort put in depends on how many hours, you know, you
00:37:01 commission me for.
00:37:02 So if it's a very detailed design and you commission me only for an hour, don't be
00:37:07 surprised if it's just like base colors at best.
00:37:10 That makes sense.
00:37:11 Yeah.
00:37:12 Well, the problem I would see with that is that I think a lot of customers probably wouldn't
00:37:16 know what to expect from, say, an hour's work.
00:37:19 Yeah, I do like previews, you know, you know, examples of what it would look like after
00:37:25 an hour or two hours or whatever.
00:37:27 I don't charge for the sketching process, though, because the sketching can take anywhere
00:37:32 between like 15 minutes to like an hour or so.
00:37:35 Because sometimes, you know, I don't get it right and then I have to redraw all the sketch
00:37:39 all over again.
00:37:40 So I don't feel like it's fair to charge for it because it'll double the price for some
00:37:44 of the commissions.
00:37:45 But other than that, the sketching is work.
00:37:48 On the other hand, though, it doubles the price.
00:37:50 Yeah.
00:37:51 By the same token.
00:37:54 Well, I don't want to rob people of their money.
00:37:57 I want to be fair.
00:37:58 Oh, but then we're coming at this from completely different angles, and if that's the case.
00:38:02 Mages, sketching is work.
00:38:04 Why is it not worth paying for the sketch part of the process?
00:38:08 Mages, let me tell you how cheap I am.
00:38:11 If I ever start doing commissions, I'm making very sure I'm going to have a whole document,
00:38:15 like a terms and services agreement you have to do.
00:38:17 Yeah.
00:38:18 And it's going to have a revision clause in there that you get two free revision.
00:38:20 After that, I charge you $3 a complaint.
00:38:22 A revision's clause is important.
00:38:25 Okay, guys, Ridley, I think of it this way.
00:38:27 I could make a butt load off of Nate if he ever commissioned me.
00:38:30 That's true.
00:38:31 That's how I do a lot of revisions.
00:38:33 He's like an addict.
00:38:34 He just keeps putting money into the machine, hoping that his commission will come out good this time.
00:38:39 When I worked with CeCe on my banner, she still tells tall tales about how many revisions
00:38:45 I had her to on that shit.
00:38:47 Was that like 100?
00:38:48 No, but it was a lot.
00:38:50 It was a lot.
00:38:51 I mean, even one is too many.
00:38:53 We were in a group chat while you were doing that, and she just kept being like,
00:38:56 what the fuck?
00:38:57 This is crazy.
00:38:58 And we were all just like, made some mad man.
00:39:00 For me, I just kind of like send them a preview of the sketch for the pose and stuff,
00:39:06 and they okay me, then I finish the drawing, and I send it over the finished drawing after they pay me.
00:39:14 And I'm not going to change anything about the pose or whatever,
00:39:19 but if they want some adjustments with the colors, I can still do that.
00:39:24 If you're not happy with the pose, tell me at the sketch stage or else you're too little too late.
00:39:30 Yeah, okay.
00:39:31 Well, we don't have to get too bogged down in the details of Mage's hypothetical commissions that don't even exist right now.
00:39:37 Sorry, man.
00:39:38 Sorry you don't care about art, man.
00:39:40 Sorry you're just not an artist mindset, man.
00:39:43 We get the idea.
00:39:45 Who have we heard from already?
00:39:47 Tom and Gibb, and now Mage.
00:39:49 Okay.
00:39:50 His name's Hippo, by the way.
00:39:52 Oh, I'm sorry.
00:39:53 Mage, do you have anything else you want to add?
00:39:55 Have a good year, everyone.
00:39:58 Yay.
00:39:59 All right.
00:40:00 Now, Mumki, how about you, my friend?
00:40:02 What are your plans for 2017?
00:40:04 Well, much like Hippo and Tom, I'm an aspiring writer,
00:40:09 but the only difference is that two years ago I wrote my book.
00:40:13 So my plan for 2017 is to actually release it.
00:40:17 I thought you were saying delete it.
00:40:20 That's probably the better plan, to be honest.
00:40:22 I've been working on this deletion for years.
00:40:28 I'm very proud of it, and I finally have a copy of it that I think I can release,
00:40:34 so I'm waiting for the first copy to come in the mail so I can make sure it's okay.
00:40:38 Are you going to do a dramatic reading of it?
00:40:41 Oh, yeah.
00:40:42 I was thinking about it, but it's really long, and I mean, if I did...
00:40:46 Maybe the first chapter.
00:40:47 Just to get people interested.
00:40:48 Yeah, I might do that for the...
00:40:49 What is the total work count of your book?
00:40:51 It's not bad.
00:40:52 The word count?
00:40:53 Yes.
00:40:54 I think it's like right around 100,000.
00:40:56 Substantial.
00:40:57 I mean, give me a work of comparable length.
00:41:00 Are we talking like Deathly Hallows' length?
00:41:03 Or are we talking Animorph's length?
00:41:05 I don't fucking know.
00:41:06 Okay.
00:41:07 Okay.
00:41:08 It's 21 chapters of a great story about a school shooting, and I love it.
00:41:15 How are you going to release it?
00:41:18 There's a website where you can self-publish called lulu.com that I actually recommend.
00:41:23 It's pretty good.
00:41:25 Oolulilia released Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters through Lulu.
00:41:29 Oh, yeah.
00:41:30 You're a good company, dude.
00:41:31 Yeah.
00:41:32 Yeah.
00:41:33 Yeah, so it's going to be there.
00:41:34 And if you're interested in hearing Munky's take on a school shooting, check out my YouTube
00:41:39 channel, and I'll post links there.
00:41:40 I thought it was going to be like the story of Elliot Roger, but from the perspective of
00:41:44 the gun or the knife.
00:41:46 That'd be interesting.
00:41:47 The book was heavily influenced by the Elliot Roger case, so...
00:41:52 Imagine.
00:41:53 As far as YouTube goals are concerned, I guess I just want to double my subs next year.
00:42:00 If I end the year with 30,000 subs, I'd be pretty happy.
00:42:03 And that's about it.
00:42:05 God, you have so many.
00:42:07 And you really gained a lot.
00:42:10 You really gained a lot recently.
00:42:12 I was just curious.
00:42:13 What was the spike from now at like 15,000 or so?
00:42:16 What were you before you started the surge?
00:42:19 I don't know if I'm on a surge right now.
00:42:21 I think I'd get like 30 subs a day.
00:42:24 Okay.
00:42:25 Well, when the Be Got to H.K.I. video went big, how many were you at at that point?
00:42:30 Zero.
00:42:31 Oh.
00:42:32 I went from zero to about 5,000 in about a day.
00:42:39 Wow.
00:42:40 And then that channel got deleted like a week later.
00:42:42 Oh, really?
00:42:43 So I lost most of those subs.
00:42:45 Oh, good.
00:42:46 But then luckily, the video went viral again, and I got a bunch of subs back.
00:42:51 Oh, I see.
00:42:52 Okay.
00:42:53 That's unusual.
00:42:54 That video was on the front page of Reddit three times.
00:42:58 Whoa.
00:42:59 Damn.
00:43:00 I'm waiting for the fourth.
00:43:02 If he got to H.K.I.
00:43:04 He's a big one, you know.
00:43:05 Which I actually have not seen.
00:43:06 Wait, no, no.
00:43:07 That's the one about the girl who wants to have sex with a million dudes or something?
00:43:11 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:43:12 I have seen that one.
00:43:13 Actually, I have not.
00:43:14 The anime or the review?
00:43:15 No, the review.
00:43:16 I don't watch anime.
00:43:17 Oh.
00:43:18 I'm not a fucking anime.
00:43:19 So, yeah, those are Mumke's goals.
00:43:22 Go check out youtube.com slash Mumke Jones.
00:43:24 Go check him out.
00:43:25 All right, cool.
00:43:26 He's pretty good.
00:43:27 Well, I mean, yeah.
00:43:29 He's pretty good at Pokemon, I've heard.
00:43:32 Yeah.
00:43:33 He just gets lucky every time.
00:43:37 Yeah, how do you like my Metagross I got, Ben?
00:43:40 First, it's a fucking, it's a Beldom.
00:43:42 It's a Metang and it will be a Metang in our next battle.
00:43:46 So don't go counting your chicken for the hatch.
00:43:48 First of all, why would I bring it to the battle if it's not a Metagross yet?
00:43:52 Hmm.
00:43:53 That's solid.
00:43:54 Yeah.
00:43:55 Solid quest.
00:43:56 Well, I mean, it's still pretty good.
00:43:58 It's still like 420 base stats.
00:44:00 Fair.
00:44:01 420, I hear you on that, brother.
00:44:03 I hear you there.
00:44:04 Yeah, high five.
00:44:05 High five.
00:44:06 Listen to Ben, not a nerd saying, talking about Pokemon stats.
00:44:09 Yeah, 420, 420 plays it with my brothers.
00:44:14 Ben, tell us more about your plans for 2017.
00:44:18 Mumke, I assume that was everything you've done.
00:44:20 Yeah, I'm a boring person.
00:44:21 Okay.
00:44:22 Agreed.
00:44:23 Agreed.
00:44:24 Ben.
00:44:25 YouTube goals in term, I guess maybe it'd be nice to hit 10,000.
00:44:29 That'd be cool.
00:44:30 I hadn't really thought about how I'm going to do that.
00:44:35 But my real goals for this year, I guess, I mean, I thought the champion would be done
00:44:42 a month or two ago.
00:44:43 So definitely going to finish that.
00:44:45 Going to finish this Nuzlocke and then probably not do one for a while.
00:44:50 Oh, Vapers 3, definitely going to do that.
00:44:56 That shouldn't take the whole year.
00:44:59 Are the rumors true that this one's about Magda?
00:45:03 That's right.
00:45:04 It is.
00:45:05 Oh, shit.
00:45:06 I know.
00:45:07 The people cried out for it and I delivered.
00:45:10 One more of that hot poof in my life.
00:45:15 So, yeah, finish champion, do Vapers 3, and then do a lot more.
00:45:21 I want to draw more comics and when I get a chance to take a break from Nuzlocke, I'm
00:45:27 sure I will be able to draw more than I had been previously.
00:45:30 And I guess I would probably like to release some kind of book, you know, like some kind
00:45:37 of collection or maybe just paper, you know, soft cover, trade paperback copies of Vapers
00:45:42 or Champion or whatever.
00:45:44 Yeah, that's a good plan.
00:45:46 So, I guess those would be my goals for 2017.
00:45:50 Oh, and also just make more money because I'm on a crash course with bankruptcy and
00:45:56 something needs to change.
00:45:58 What's your time frame?
00:45:59 Is that going to be within 2017?
00:46:02 Possibly.
00:46:03 Possibly.
00:46:04 We'll probably know by the end of the year.
00:46:05 Worst case scenario, yes.
00:46:07 Okay, how exciting.
00:46:08 Oh, yeah.
00:46:09 Oh, yeah.
00:46:10 I've got one more question.
00:46:12 You've been making a couple like little analysis type of videos on your channel.
00:46:16 Oh, that's right.
00:46:17 Plans to do more of those because I like them.
00:46:19 Yeah.
00:46:20 I guess in terms of YouTube, I'm not saying I'll never do another Nuzlocke again, but
00:46:25 not for a while.
00:46:26 And so, if I guess once that's over, I will probably go back to posting like speed draws,
00:46:33 possibly art vlogs, and yeah, maybe a couple more of those little analytical, I don't know
00:46:39 if I'd call them in now.
00:46:40 Yeah, I guess they're in now.
00:46:41 Yeah, they're in there.
00:46:42 They're analytical rants.
00:46:43 They're just my thoughts.
00:46:44 I just thought, thought dump, fucking vlog, you know, I just talked about shit.
00:46:48 I really like those.
00:46:50 And I thought that for the final product, the effort, the effort put into quality of final
00:46:57 product ratio was really good on those.
00:47:00 And that ratio is something that I'm pursuing intensely these days.
00:47:04 And yeah, like, I mean, the first one was like, I just sat down and talked for half
00:47:08 an hour.
00:47:09 I spent maybe like, I don't know, two or three hours editing to turn like the film footage
00:47:13 into the repeating like looping clips because I like, I like that inspired by Digi's decompression
00:47:20 chamber.
00:47:21 I decided to do that.
00:47:23 And also, because that, that was an easy way to get by the YouTube restrictions because
00:47:27 they, Davoo and Digi kept telling me, Ben, don't go over 10 second clips.
00:47:32 And I was like, well, I don't want to find like, it's like a 20 minute video.
00:47:36 That means I'd have to find like, like a hundred clips.
00:47:38 I don't know.
00:47:39 I can't do math.
00:47:40 I need to find so many clips to fill that up.
00:47:42 Fuck that.
00:47:43 I was like, what if I found one clip and just looped it over and over again?
00:47:47 And it was great.
00:47:48 It was brilliant.
00:47:49 I'm a genius.
00:47:50 So anyway, I really liked how those came out.
00:47:52 And yes, I will do more of those.
00:47:53 And I guess that will probably be a big part of my YouTube shit going forward.
00:48:00 Or I hope so.
00:48:01 I hope they can find success because that one, the one about the Ghibli, the one about
00:48:06 only yesterday performed reasonably well actually, better than I expected it to.
00:48:10 How many, how many views does that have, man?
00:48:11 The Space Funeral 1 did okay.
00:48:13 It's like, is that like 3,000?
00:48:14 That's pretty good for a channel of like 2,000 subs.
00:48:17 Oh, or wait, wait, let me, let me double check.
00:48:18 It got, it got, yeah, just under 3,000.
00:48:24 Yeah, that's cool.
00:48:25 Yeah.
00:48:26 So it reached outside my sub base, which is, I mean, what more can you ask for?
00:48:32 To true.
00:48:34 That's the goal.
00:48:35 So yeah, that's my plans.
00:48:36 Some more YouTube stuff, lots more comics, maybe doing some actual printing and trade
00:48:42 paperback publishing and, you know, try and get that going.
00:48:47 Since that, since that was the goal.
00:48:48 Ever since I started drawing comics, that was the goal.
00:48:51 Like all my pages are formatted for book form and stuff.
00:48:54 They're not really formatted for the internet because I always wanted to sell them and to
00:48:58 sell physical copies.
00:48:59 It would be pretty cool to buy a Vapor's Trilogy book.
00:49:04 I know, man.
00:49:05 It would be, it would be pretty, that's the dream, right?
00:49:08 You know, I feel like, I feel like there's a lot of people that are more focused on that
00:49:11 than me.
00:49:12 Like I never really, I don't know.
00:49:16 Some people don't feel like they're legit until they have a physical form, a physical
00:49:20 book and like I don't feel that way, but still it is, it would be cool.
00:49:25 That feels somewhat of a hangover from the days when books were all there was.
00:49:28 Yeah.
00:49:29 But now there's, you know.
00:49:30 Totally.
00:49:31 The tangibility definitely kind of like, oh yeah.
00:49:34 It appeals to us as material beings.
00:49:37 It just makes it feel more significant.
00:49:39 There are, you know, there are people that would buy a comic book that would not read
00:49:44 a comic on the internet.
00:49:45 You know, like there's people that you can reach that way that you wouldn't reach on
00:49:50 the internet.
00:49:51 So like, you know, it's another thing, another region to expand into that would be neat.
00:49:59 And I would really, I would really like to get like picked up by a company, picked up
00:50:04 by a publisher and published, but if that doesn't happen, then I will just fucking bootstrap
00:50:11 and do it myself because that's what I've done my whole life and I'm going to keep doing
00:50:14 it for as long as necessary.
00:50:17 I'd like to get picked up by a big burly man who can protect me in his arms.
00:50:22 That's my goal for 2013.
00:50:23 Sure.
00:50:24 Like out of the act of one moon.
00:50:26 Get Machamp.
00:50:27 Oh yeah, Machamp.
00:50:28 That's right.
00:50:29 My favorite guy.
00:50:30 His warm embrace.
00:50:32 Well, that's cool.
00:50:35 Anything else?
00:50:36 Is that everything?
00:50:37 No.
00:50:38 Wait.
00:50:39 Yes.
00:50:40 Alright.
00:50:41 Patreon.com.
00:50:42 Of course.
00:50:43 Of course.
00:50:44 Okay.
00:50:45 So everybody's gone.
00:50:47 So I guess.
00:50:48 All the important people gone.
00:50:49 Okay.
00:50:50 We can go home.
00:50:51 We can end the podcast now.
00:50:52 Thanks for coming everybody.
00:50:53 Goodbye.
00:50:54 Wait.
00:50:55 There are more people here.
00:50:56 Well, there's me.
00:50:57 I haven't gone.
00:50:58 I don't know.
00:50:59 I've made my stuff pretty clear in like my now second to last video.
00:51:03 I gotta tell you, I'm so thrilled to have managed to get that last, you know, edit
00:51:08 manga video out before the end of the year.
00:51:10 That was one of my goals.
00:51:11 Thank God I did it.
00:51:12 Yeah.
00:51:13 It took way too long anyway, but still might as well get it done.
00:51:15 Best manga ever, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer is, you know, it's really different
00:51:20 from your other stuff.
00:51:22 And yet I feel like it makes sense in the grand scheme of the best guy ever and what
00:51:30 and the values that your channel represents.
00:51:32 I agree.
00:51:33 Yeah.
00:51:34 I think it does work as, as like, like you're the best guy ever and every video you make
00:51:39 on anything has to be the best version of a review or a true thing of that thing ever.
00:51:46 Whatever it is, whatever it is, it's the best one that I know that like you've been wrestling
00:51:51 with the idea of like trying to find a way to increase your output of production, but
00:51:56 I feel like at this point that it almost spits in the face of the channel's like established
00:51:59 personality at this point, that like your production value is like so key to just like
00:52:04 your identity at this point.
00:52:05 And I think it's, it's something that YouTube is severely lacking.
00:52:10 I feel like you're, I think what you should probably be focusing on isn't like, how do
00:52:13 I make things faster, but how do I get people to partner their shekels in a more significant
00:52:17 fashion to, to fund my slow production.
00:52:21 I have, I have to disagree.
00:52:23 I really think that I really think there are areas where fat could be trimmed from the
00:52:28 production pipeline without sacrificing too much quality.
00:52:31 I think, I think that's a fair argument, but I don't, that's not what I'm saying.
00:52:34 I'm saying if you can trim the fat and make the same quality done faster, I agree, but
00:52:38 I don't think that the production values should drop down in the name of quicker output.
00:52:44 You know, I agree with that.
00:52:45 I agree.
00:52:46 And I think what it comes down to is sort of the way in which I release things like,
00:52:52 you know, making one 45 minute video about a thing and releasing it once every six months
00:52:58 is just like, you don't have to do it that way and it's not optimal.
00:53:02 So you know, there are other ways to get to the same end goal than doing it in that way.
00:53:07 So I mean, yeah, that's relevant.
00:53:08 Like these, these are a lot of the things I've been thinking about, about the way in
00:53:11 which I produce content.
00:53:13 Because you know, I like everything I've done, but I am really trying to think I'm very serious
00:53:18 at this point, since I've met all my obligations to making my stuff viable as a way to survive
00:53:26 on YouTube.
00:53:27 And people are already quite generous on Patreon with me, considering how much I've released.
00:53:33 It's, it's, it's very, it's very much appreciated.
00:53:37 But I do still need a bunch more if I want to be able to live solely on it.
00:53:41 So, you know, but you know, so that, that's where I'm at.
00:53:46 My goal is to in 2017, leave my job and do YouTube full time and you know, whatever capacity
00:53:54 is appropriate.
00:53:55 And a lot of that involves changing my content a little bit, you know, somewhat, and a lot
00:54:00 of it also involves working with the procrastinators.
00:54:03 Because I really see a bright future with, with the procrastinators and specifically projects
00:54:09 like the plebe and the weeb and other things that we haven't, that haven't even been, you
00:54:15 know, concocted yet.
00:54:17 But there are all kinds of things we could do.
00:54:19 And I really, I really use red letter media as an example of, of how you can make that
00:54:24 work.
00:54:25 Frankly, I don't know how those guys can afford to survive.
00:54:27 It doesn't seem like their channel is quite big enough to support, you know, I don't know
00:54:31 how many people are involved in that production, like six people, maybe some of them have jobs
00:54:34 they do on the side.
00:54:35 They're, you know, like they have that.
00:54:39 I don't know.
00:54:40 I don't know.
00:54:41 But that's fairly new, you know.
00:54:42 They have a Patreon.
00:54:43 Even before Patreon, they were selling merchandise and they were, they were selling films and
00:54:46 stuff.
00:54:47 So I'm assuming they're making a decent amount of money through merchandising.
00:54:51 Those guys make a lot of money.
00:54:52 Even on ad revenue.
00:54:53 I've bought two of their shirts over, over Christmas vacation.
00:54:56 And finally, I'm so glad I got a, I got a VHS repair shop t-shirt and I love it.
00:55:03 I love it.
00:55:04 That's what we need to do.
00:55:05 We got to, we got to merchandise the PCP.
00:55:08 You know, for real though, that's, that's, that's definitely true.
00:55:11 Right now the PCP makes zero money.
00:55:13 What's that made?
00:55:14 I can make some draws for like maybe shirt designs or something.
00:55:18 That'd be cool.
00:55:19 Yeah.
00:55:20 I really think in 2017, this is something that we should do.
00:55:22 Uh, it just, just kind of building up the organizational infrastructure here.
00:55:27 I mean, it'd be nice, really the, the show plebe and the weeb is sort of a PCP project,
00:55:33 but we would just release it on Digi's channel.
00:55:35 I mean, it's, you know, he did the thing for the most part, but since PCP is too small
00:55:40 and it wouldn't be paid attention to it, it's, it's released on that.
00:55:43 But like in the future, you know, this is the place where things like that would be
00:55:48 for the most part.
00:55:49 So, you know, I, I don't know, I don't have all the thoughts worked out yet, but I think
00:55:53 about it.
00:55:54 I think if we want the PCP channel to be like Reddler to Meteor, we would need to have like
00:55:58 a, like a star show, like Mr. Plinkett to go on there.
00:56:04 And I don't know whether anyone would be up for not putting it on their own channel
00:56:08 and instead putting it on the PCP, which is why it's kind of weird that.
00:56:12 Well, it would have to grow, you know, I looked it up and their Patreon is at $16,000 per
00:56:18 month.
00:56:19 Well, that's pretty good.
00:56:20 There we go.
00:56:21 It's pretty good.
00:56:22 Yeah.
00:56:23 That's split between, you know, like how many people I'm gonna say six, but I don't
00:56:27 know.
00:56:28 Well, I don't know.
00:56:30 Maybe some of the guys are part-time and it's just like Mike and Jay and Rich, I guess.
00:56:34 I don't know.
00:56:35 I think Rich is a construction worker.
00:56:37 What?
00:56:38 He just showed up.
00:56:39 Yeah.
00:56:40 Yeah.
00:56:41 Wait.
00:56:42 Oh God.
00:56:43 Does he build things?
00:56:44 Yeah.
00:56:45 Like he just does this like part-time.
00:56:46 He does build.
00:56:47 He does build.
00:56:48 Instruction work.
00:56:49 Man, that's, that's, I want to say that's crazy.
00:56:55 That union dog, that union.
00:56:58 Wait.
00:56:59 Oh God.
00:57:00 I just remembered the most important goal for 2017.
00:57:03 Yeah.
00:57:04 Just touch more boobs.
00:57:05 Oh.
00:57:06 I don't even get into that shit.
00:57:09 What?
00:57:10 What?
00:57:11 What?
00:57:12 Who said that?
00:57:13 What?
00:57:14 I don't know.
00:57:15 I didn't hear it, but it made me mad.
00:57:16 I just said I hope you kill yourself.
00:57:17 Oh wow.
00:57:18 Well, thank you.
00:57:19 Yeah.
00:57:20 I just, yes.
00:57:21 I crave the, I crave the touch of a woman, the scent of a woman.
00:57:26 And I must have it.
00:57:27 I must hunt one down.
00:57:28 By any means.
00:57:29 Ladies get out there and date him.
00:57:32 Ladies go on and date him.
00:57:34 But she smells good.
00:57:36 Smells like a woman.
00:57:37 You know.
00:57:38 That's a good smell.
00:57:39 Then that's what I'm looking for.
00:57:43 Yeah.
00:57:44 Anyway, yeah.
00:57:45 Mm.
00:57:46 Yep.
00:57:47 That's all I have to say about that.
00:57:49 Great.
00:57:50 Let's, let's please move on.
00:57:55 Okay.
00:57:56 I don't know.
00:57:57 I'm just thinking if I have anything else to say.
00:57:58 I don't know.
00:57:59 I need money.
00:58:00 Everyone give me money on Patreon.
00:58:01 Yeah.
00:58:02 Yeah.
00:58:03 Faster videos will come.
00:58:04 Yeah.
00:58:05 I need it most.
00:58:06 I just want to say that I do think legitimately my transition from being able to do YouTube
00:58:12 barely any time to do it at the end of the day after I work all fucking day to being
00:58:17 able to do it all the time would be a big transformation and we all know best guy ever
00:58:22 is the best content.
00:58:23 We all know it.
00:58:24 It's a fact.
00:58:25 You can't deny it.
00:58:26 So please people do yourselves in the world of favor by, by giving, giving me money so
00:58:31 I can, so I can make more of it.
00:58:32 How much do you need to do it full time?
00:58:35 My, my goal is a month.
00:58:37 This would be a massive pay cut from what I make now.
00:58:41 But if I made around $750 per video on my Patreon, I think that would be a starting like
00:58:47 livable wage.
00:58:48 I could build on that.
00:58:49 How are you people using such a little money?
00:58:51 Based on how many videos per month?
00:58:54 Based on two.
00:58:55 That's based on two videos.
00:58:56 Well, I'll raise you one, Nate.
00:58:57 I, I could do, I could work full time for $600 a month, I think.
00:59:02 But you already do.
00:59:03 I think I could swing it.
00:59:04 I think I could swing it.
00:59:05 You do for $0 a month already.
00:59:06 So, so who, so who's delivering the better value on your dollar here, patrons?
00:59:10 Do we have any fan questions this week?
00:59:12 Oh yeah.
00:59:13 That's, that's good.
00:59:14 We certainly do.
00:59:15 Let's go to the Twitter.
00:59:16 I need to have like a private discussion with both of you and how you can live on such
00:59:20 a little money.
00:59:21 I need to learn these secrets.
00:59:22 My overhead is like nothing.
00:59:23 It's not.
00:59:24 I mean, no, talk to Ben.
00:59:25 I, I live on a salary, so I'm, I'm okay.
00:59:28 You know, don't.
00:59:29 Ben moves.
00:59:30 My, my, I, I pay, I pay rent at, at Digi's house and I fucking eat leftovers and that's
00:59:34 my whole life.
00:59:35 Shit.
00:59:36 Yeah.
00:59:37 Ben's a master of, uh.
00:59:38 I need to move in with Digi then, clearly.
00:59:39 Yeah.
00:59:40 Okay, here we go.
00:59:41 Don't, don't muscle in on my leftovers.
00:59:43 I eat nothing but ramen right now.
00:59:46 I eat those for the Pokemon battles.
00:59:48 Oh shit.
00:59:49 That's true.
00:59:50 Okay.
00:59:51 So we're, we're moving on.
00:59:52 Last time.
00:59:53 Yeah.
00:59:54 Munch, uh, uh, monkey was wondering where Ben found those leftovers.
00:59:56 Now you have your answer.
00:59:57 Um, so, okay.
00:59:59 So it's time to move into the non-gay section of the thing where we, uh, answer questions.
01:00:03 We, we always tweet and when we start recording generally on Saturdays, uh, at the procrastinators,
01:00:07 uh, Twitter at TP Crastinators, uh, that we're recording to ask us questions that we will
01:00:13 answer at the end of the show.
01:00:16 So, uh, let me see, I put that out and I'm going to find some fucking questions in here.
01:00:21 I should mention right now that we're all recording this on New Year's Eve, so none
01:00:25 of us went to a party.
01:00:26 Yeah, I know.
01:00:27 None of us had any friends.
01:00:28 No.
01:00:29 Pretend it's not that night.
01:00:30 Pretend that we're cool.
01:00:31 I'll be, I'll be drinking maybe.
01:00:32 Yeah.
01:00:33 I'll be trying.
01:00:34 I guess I'll be trying.
01:00:35 That's how shit my life is.
01:00:36 I'm tipsy right now.
01:00:37 Yeah.
01:00:38 I have no friends and I'm home alone.
01:00:40 Here, uh, okay.
01:00:41 Here's one.
01:00:42 I mean, I don't know if anyone even has an answer for this, but we can kind of chew on
01:00:45 it while I look for more.
01:00:46 Uh, anyone have a best creator non-PCP of 2016?
01:00:51 Who's, who's somebody who's made some of that impress you this year?
01:00:54 Yeah.
01:00:55 Why did we need that, that special caveat?
01:00:56 Of course I wasn't going to pick a fucking PCP member.
01:00:58 Well, because obviously everyone would just say me.
01:00:59 They would say me if they knew.
01:01:00 So, exempting me.
01:01:01 That's true.
01:01:02 Well, the Ben Saints and the Nates of the World might, but I don't know about the rest
01:01:05 of us.
01:01:06 That's right.
01:01:07 Um, some of it.
01:01:08 Okay.
01:01:09 Okay.
01:01:10 What happened in 2016 in terms of YouTube videos?
01:01:12 Uh, the Fine Bros launched their really successful network.
01:01:14 Yes.
01:01:15 Ben, Ben, Ben.
01:01:17 Got him.
01:01:18 That's pretty good.
01:01:19 Uh, my answer is the Fine Boy.
01:01:22 H3, H3 stopped being funny.
01:01:25 Jon Tron stopped being funny.
01:01:27 H3 is okay.
01:01:28 H3, H3 is the same as he has always been.
01:01:30 Okay, so he was never funny.
01:01:31 He's got more money than he had.
01:01:32 Yeah.
01:01:33 A lot more.
01:01:34 A lot more.
01:01:35 Um, everyone sucks this year.
01:01:37 Uh, Maddox destroyed his personal and professional reputation.
01:01:41 Oh no.
01:01:42 Yeah, that's true.
01:01:43 I mean, Dick, Dick Show is just a commercial for Dick and how cool he can be.
01:01:48 And it's the 50 second.
01:01:49 Is that a good thing or a bad thing though?
01:01:50 It's a 50 second tie as Patreon.
01:01:51 He can't stand it.
01:01:52 Okay.
01:01:53 I don't, I don't watch it, but I can't stand it.
01:01:55 Oh, I love the Dick Show.
01:01:56 It's great.
01:01:57 Yeah.
01:01:58 I don't want to give it a chance.
01:01:59 I don't want to give it a chance to win me over.
01:02:01 I can't, I can't think of a single one 2016.
01:02:06 I mean, 2016 is a whole year.
01:02:08 So that's a long time.
01:02:09 I'm trying to remember anything I even gave a fuck about.
01:02:12 Did any video games, did any video games come out this year?
01:02:17 Doom 2016 kicked fucking ass.
01:02:20 Yeah.
01:02:21 Wasn't Dark Souls 3 this year too?
01:02:23 It was.
01:02:24 Oh wait, wait.
01:02:25 Oh wait.
01:02:26 One minute ago.
01:02:27 It's, it's, can I be in this video by a HGB guy?
01:02:30 Let me link it.
01:02:31 I don't know what it's going to be, but it's, it's my brother in a horse mask.
01:02:34 I'm giving, I'm giving artist of the year to HGB guy for sure.
01:02:39 That's my Amungus.
01:02:40 Yeah.
01:02:41 The fucking Champ of Amungus.
01:02:43 He gets, he gets it.
01:02:45 Everyone go onto YouTube, go to HGB guy.
01:02:49 Let's put a fucking link in the description to the artist of the year.
01:02:52 The HGB guy is your brother.
01:02:54 Yeah.
01:02:55 Yeah.
01:02:56 That's right.
01:02:57 I feel like I've seen that person fave some of my tweets and I had no idea.
01:03:01 For introducing, for introducing the character of Cunt Corona.
01:03:05 You know, he's going to be big.
01:03:06 He's going to be big.
01:03:07 I'm really excited for what he's going to do this year.
01:03:10 Oh, I want to say I did, I took great strides this year because I finally got a YouTube URL.
01:03:17 My YouTube URL is now, is now C slash Ben St. Comics and I'm so fucking proud of myself.
01:03:23 Hey, hey, try entering that URL sometime without the C because it just works sometimes.
01:03:28 I don't know.
01:03:29 It's a little mysterious.
01:03:30 Yeah.
01:03:31 Give it a try.
01:03:32 Whenever I post a link that's like going to be a text, I just get rid of the C and it's fine.
01:03:37 It just sort of figures it out that hypocrite means hypocrite user.
01:03:41 Okay.
01:03:42 Here's, here's a substantive question.
01:03:44 Oh, I forgot to say who that was.
01:03:46 I'll go back to it in a minute, but at kin, kin.
01:03:50 Okay.
01:03:51 It's kin KKUK at that guy says, are you planning on doing any other PCP races anytime soon?
01:03:58 And the answer is yes.
01:03:59 Yes.
01:04:00 We are thinking about what to do.
01:04:02 We don't know what they're going to be yet.
01:04:04 Race war.
01:04:05 Race forever, forever to decide on the, on the Pokemon race.
01:04:09 I said we should do Spyro one first person to get 10 dragons wins.
01:04:14 I don't do over that audience.
01:04:16 That's not a bad.
01:04:17 I like that kind of goal.
01:04:18 I think that's not bad at some point.
01:04:20 I feel.
01:04:21 Yes.
01:04:22 I think that Mega Man or Mega Man X, but like a specific challenge.
01:04:25 Let's just do them all at the same time.
01:04:29 Each one of us picks our own game, makes up our own goal, and then we all race toward
01:04:34 the end.
01:04:35 I'm just telling you, I want a speed run gotten home in that case.
01:04:38 That's a 20 second completion time.
01:04:40 Oh, by the way, I just want to say before the best creator, non-PCB of 2016, that was
01:04:45 at the out sin.
01:04:47 So thanks.
01:04:48 Thanks buddy for that question.
01:04:50 HGB guy.
01:04:51 HGB guy.
01:04:52 Yes.
01:04:53 It was him.
01:04:54 Okay.
01:04:55 So here's, here's one more and we get this is going to be the last one, I guess.
01:04:58 Anyone have by at John Attenbury.
01:05:03 What is the top PCP meme of 2016?
01:05:06 So Radcon 2 was this year.
01:05:08 I mean, Radcon 1 was this year.
01:05:10 So there was quite a few.
01:05:11 Oh man.
01:05:12 There was a lot.
01:05:13 It would have to be.
01:05:14 I like, I like handboys.
01:05:15 I think I got to go with handboys.
01:05:16 Oh yeah.
01:05:17 It's definitely.
01:05:18 Handboys.
01:05:19 Handboys.
01:05:20 Yep.
01:05:21 That's it.
01:05:22 That's the answer.
01:05:23 I also, I also enjoy, it's not really a PCB exclusive meme.
01:05:25 Well actually, there's half of the people here that weren't at the first Radcon and don't
01:05:29 know handboys.
01:05:30 Yeah.
01:05:31 I have no context.
01:05:32 What I enjoyed the most simply because it related to something I was present for was
01:05:35 the resurrection of Double Batman and introduction of Triple Joker.
01:05:37 Double Batman, Double Batman.
01:05:38 Yeah.
01:05:39 Expansion into the Triple Joker as well.
01:05:40 Only a Triple Joker can kill the Double Batman.
01:05:42 That is a solid pick.
01:05:43 That is proven in the, in the.
01:05:44 Solid match.
01:05:45 You know, my favorite meme was the wrestling show that we did.
01:05:49 The wrestling.
01:05:50 That was great.
01:05:51 Everything that happened in that thing was great.
01:05:53 Everything about it was just solid, solid gold.
01:05:56 It was.
01:05:57 Man, I can't wait to do another one at Radcon 2 in one week.
01:06:01 Actually, oh my God, it's so, it's so soon.
01:06:04 It's not weird.
01:06:05 It's like five days from now.
01:06:06 That is fucking weird.
01:06:07 Well, I don't know if this counts as a meme, but the, the hunger, the hunger games, the
01:06:13 hunger games battles that the hippo has been popularized.
01:06:17 He's popularized them a couple of times this year and I really like it.
01:06:20 We did the Pokemon ones to pick Pokemon teams.
01:06:23 And then we did the hippo.
01:06:24 You just did the one with the PCP.
01:06:25 That was great.
01:06:26 It was great.
01:06:27 It just so happened to be perfect.
01:06:29 Especially with you.
01:06:30 Yes.
01:06:31 And the KKK and Vincent.
01:06:32 Me and the KKK and Vincent and Davoo and, and I was like stealing from, from, from Brunswick
01:06:38 when he's asleep.
01:06:39 I think I'm just going to let all of the KKK in the back.
01:06:43 Yeah.
01:06:44 When his back was turned, he's too powerful.
01:06:47 That's, uh, and then at the very end, uh, when, uh, Colt came back from beyond the grave
01:06:54 to execute Jesse.
01:06:55 Yeah.
01:06:56 Glorious, glorious.
01:06:57 Okay.
01:06:58 I think we're done for now.
01:06:59 No more questions.
01:07:00 No more questions.
01:07:01 But there are so many questions.
01:07:02 Uh, well, I mean, we can't fucking do this all day.
01:07:04 How long have we been recording for?
01:07:05 How long have we been recording for?
01:07:06 How long have we been recording for?
01:07:07 Wait, wait, wait.
01:07:08 An hour and 10 minutes.
01:07:09 We've got like 10 minutes, 10 minutes until, uh, New Year's for England.
01:07:12 Yeah.
01:07:13 Oh, should we just hang out for 10 minutes until it's New Year's time?
01:07:16 Yeah.
01:07:17 I think we should.
01:07:18 We could do, we could do a few more questions.
01:07:19 Okay, tell you what.
01:07:20 We'll do some more questions.
01:07:21 Especially the question I won.
01:07:22 Oh, okay.
01:07:23 Go for it.
01:07:24 And then until 5.5, will, will you read it?
01:07:26 Uh, will I read it?
01:07:28 Yes.
01:07:29 Okay.
01:07:30 I'm looking.
01:07:31 Uh, one sec.
01:07:32 I don't, I know.
01:07:33 Is this just on the Twitter?
01:07:35 I mean, I'm looking at it.
01:07:36 I don't.
01:07:37 Oh, here it is.
01:07:38 Okay.
01:07:39 Let's see.
01:07:40 Oh shit.
01:07:41 Okay.
01:07:42 This is a good question.
01:07:43 Uh, like you said, at Ninto 55, if the entire PCP were to move to one country, which would
01:07:45 you guys want, excluding the USA, UK, and Japan for obvious reasons, I might, I want
01:07:52 to go to Japan dog.
01:07:53 I want to go be a Gaijin, uh, live in the neat life, but can't do it.
01:07:56 So.
01:07:57 Estonia.
01:07:58 No, guys, guys.
01:07:59 Oh, let's, let's just go to Lithuania.
01:08:00 Yeah.
01:08:01 Exactly.
01:08:02 Like, guys, Lithuania has like the best, fastest, unlimited interwebs.
01:08:09 It's, it's.
01:08:10 Oh, that's all I needed to hear.
01:08:12 It's great.
01:08:13 Like, like it doesn't, at least the internet I'm with, like it doesn't have any monthly
01:08:17 limits and it doesn't have like a stupid limit on it for like to download at like 16
01:08:22 megabytes for whatever.
01:08:24 It's, what's the, uh, what's the lolliporn situation?
01:08:27 Allowed?
01:08:28 Not allowed?
01:08:29 I, I haven't looked into it, Nate.
01:08:30 Oh, you've looked into it.
01:08:31 Don't lie to me.
01:08:32 Don't lie to me.
01:08:35 You, you shame me, Nate.
01:08:36 You shame me.
01:08:37 I'm just looking out for your best interest, Ben.
01:08:39 I'm trying to protect you.
01:08:40 No, stop.
01:08:41 Get out of here.
01:08:44 Don't, don't.
01:08:45 Any other contenders here?
01:08:47 Yeah.
01:08:48 The internet's great.
01:08:49 The food is great.
01:08:50 It's, it's a good.
01:08:51 It's a good country.
01:08:52 Like if you guys, guys, like the best part is if you get paid for it, it's a good country.
01:08:55 The best part is if you get paid by like Patreon, whatever, by like foreign money and
01:09:00 just spend it in Lithuania, everything would be super cheap to you in Lithuania.
01:09:03 Yes.
01:09:04 Yes.
01:09:05 That's true.
01:09:06 You're making a solid argument right now, man.
01:09:07 And if you say, if when you're coming in, if you say that you're a war refugee, they
01:09:11 just like give you a hot wife to rape.
01:09:12 So, you know, looking, that sounds pretty good.
01:09:15 Nate, what the fuck, man?
01:09:17 That's, that's right.
01:09:18 That's what I hear.
01:09:19 I appreciate it.
01:09:20 All right.
01:09:21 We're, we're in Eastern Europe, not Western.
01:09:23 Yeah.
01:09:24 Oh, okay.
01:09:25 My bad.
01:09:26 My bad.
01:09:27 We can go to Germany and that'll be fine.
01:09:28 Actually, the refugees escaped from Lithuania to go to Germany from what I've heard.
01:09:33 Yeah.
01:09:34 But let's not go into that.
01:09:36 But yeah.
01:09:37 I was going to say, oh yeah, yeah.
01:09:42 It's super cheap.
01:09:43 I probably could.
01:09:44 If I moved to Lithuania, I probably could live on what I make on Patreon right now.
01:09:47 And then I'd never have to draw another comic in my life.
01:09:50 Thank God.
01:09:51 Thank God.
01:09:52 Yes.
01:09:53 I do want to say that I think Nigeria might be a good place because there's this, there's
01:09:57 this prince who's been emailing me for a while.
01:09:59 And it sounds like there's some good land deals that are just available to me.
01:10:02 If I were to, you know, go down there.
01:10:04 Wireless LAN.
01:10:05 Yeah.
01:10:06 Yeah.
01:10:07 Wireless LAN.
01:10:08 He's going to give me a budget on my, on my land.
01:10:10 Well, hey guys.
01:10:11 I mean, it, it's technically, in some respects, it is part of the United States, but it is
01:10:17 also kind of an extra dimensional location.
01:10:19 So I'm voting for the city of Quickville.
01:10:22 Oh, that's a good one.
01:10:24 The city of Quickville, it is a cool place with an average amount of cool places to chill
01:10:29 at.
01:10:30 That's true.
01:10:31 I mean, they've got McDonald's.
01:10:33 They've got the mall.
01:10:36 Great places for a date.
01:10:38 McDonald's.
01:10:39 Quickville mall.
01:10:40 The mayor is a benevolent dictator.
01:10:42 That's true.
01:10:43 He polices our thoughts for our own well-being.
01:10:45 So I appreciate that.
01:10:46 Yeah.
01:10:47 Nobody's gay.
01:10:48 Nobody's gay.
01:10:49 They've cured gayness in Quickville.
01:10:50 And, and asexuality too.
01:10:52 So there you go.
01:10:53 Thank God.
01:10:54 I, I won't go there.
01:10:55 No thanks.
01:10:56 You might be obliterated if you set foot mage.
01:10:58 So watch out.
01:10:59 Disintegrate.
01:11:00 I think we should all move to LazyTown.
01:11:03 Oh, man.
01:11:04 It's like a paradise.
01:11:06 It is a paradise.
01:11:07 I am pretty lazy.
01:11:09 And we could join Rot and Robbie's team and help them out, catching that sport of flop
01:11:13 faggot.
01:11:14 I mean, Robbie Rotten, you fucking...
01:11:15 Oh, what did I say?
01:11:16 What did I say?
01:11:17 You said Rot and Robbie.
01:11:18 Oh, it's the same shit.
01:11:19 Really?
01:11:20 Yeah.
01:11:21 Come on, dude.
01:11:22 Wrong way around.
01:11:23 And we're, we're the biggest, uh, uh, anime analysis of LazyTown guys there is.
01:11:27 So you gotta, we gotta reputation to maintain.
01:11:29 That's true.
01:11:30 I was analyzing it in my head every moment I see it.
01:11:34 Um, okay.
01:11:35 We need a new question.
01:11:36 This is, this, this one's dying.
01:11:38 Um.
01:11:39 We'll go on, man.
01:11:40 Let's see.
01:11:41 Let's see.
01:11:42 I'm just sitting here.
01:11:43 I'm just sitting here vaping, vaping my life away.
01:11:46 Okay.
01:11:47 Okay.
01:11:48 Here's, here's one, uh, uh, by, uh, at unwe on me.
01:11:52 Uh, how mad.
01:11:53 So we're looking for a one to 10.
01:11:55 Will Ben be when mumky beats him again?
01:11:58 So, you know, what's...
01:12:00 I can answer that.
01:12:01 I can answer that question.
01:12:02 I can answer that question.
01:12:03 Only you can, Ben.
01:12:05 It's, it's, it's an, it's an exponential increase every time.
01:12:09 So like the first time I was upset.
01:12:13 The second time I was 10 times as upset.
01:12:16 Right.
01:12:17 So next time.
01:12:18 I detected that.
01:12:19 Yeah.
01:12:20 So next time.
01:12:21 115 times.
01:12:22 I will be, it'll be a hundred times.
01:12:23 And, um, that'll be, that'll be, I think, that'll be approaching the limit of what a
01:12:27 human being, uh, can survive.
01:12:30 Yeah.
01:12:31 If I can sleep up here, Ben.
01:12:32 It's like mob cycle.
01:12:33 Sure, mumky.
01:12:34 Exactly.
01:12:35 Exactly.
01:12:36 To get your expectations at a fair level.
01:12:38 Sure.
01:12:39 I need to assure you beyond a reasonable doubt that you will never beat me in that game.
01:12:47 I fucking promise you.
01:12:49 Okay.
01:12:50 And that's all I have to say.
01:12:51 Expectations managed.
01:12:52 That's all I have to say.
01:12:53 Thank you very much.
01:12:55 Well, I'm excited to do it.
01:12:57 Oh shit, Ben.
01:12:58 We, we got a battle.
01:12:59 I battled mumky already.
01:13:00 Uh, yeah.
01:13:01 I am, I, I'm, I'm a little behind.
01:13:04 Oh, and I want to battle mumky too.
01:13:06 We'll do that.
01:13:07 Guys, like, battle on the, like, the page where, uh.
01:13:11 We go, it, it's, it's, I don't know.
01:13:13 You gotta add each of his friend codes.
01:13:15 Oh, you mean, like, are they actually giving me?
01:13:16 You add friend codes.
01:13:17 Okay.
01:13:18 Yeah.
01:13:19 Yeah.
01:13:20 Not on Smogon.
01:13:21 Yeah, okay.
01:13:22 Although you can't, or not Smogon, showdown, although you can do it there too.
01:13:24 Okay, here's one, here's one.
01:13:26 Um, guys, by at Sefixer, it's S-E-P-H-Y-X-E-R.
01:13:32 So fuck you, dude.
01:13:33 Sefixer.
01:13:34 Sefixer.
01:13:35 Um, what kind of project would you like to do if you had all the time, skills, money,
01:13:40 and motivation, et cetera, to do it?
01:13:43 I would make exactly the same kind of content.
01:13:45 I might make an anime myself, but other than that, I'd probably just make the same kind
01:13:49 of shit I like doing already.
01:13:50 If I had a limited whatever, I would like to recreate Homestuck, but starring me and the
01:13:56 PCP, I'd actually have a good ending.
01:13:58 Which you did start, which you did start.
01:14:00 Oh man.
01:14:01 Oh man.
01:14:02 Sorry, I just realized what I would do.
01:14:04 I would make a game the one I've always wanted to make.
01:14:09 What kind of game?
01:14:10 Kind of a tale too.
01:14:11 No.
01:14:12 Hippo, I did tell you about it when we met up before Pokemon Go a little bit.
01:14:19 Remember?
01:14:20 It's kind of like Pokemon, but not.
01:14:22 Actually, I'd probably make a game too.
01:14:25 There's a game I did that's burning in the back of my mind for a better part of five
01:14:29 years.
01:14:30 Oh really?
01:14:31 I would probably do that.
01:14:33 That's cool.
01:14:34 Well, mostly I would do the same things I'm doing now.
01:14:38 I would draw comics, but I would outsource some of the work.
01:14:44 I would outsource backgrounds and things that take up a lot of time and that I don't feel
01:14:48 nabbed that much.
01:14:51 I would pay someone to do background art and stuff.
01:14:54 That's cool.
01:14:55 I would probably make games.
01:15:02 I would start dabbling in mechanically minimal lists, narrative, short game projects is something
01:15:12 that I've kind of wanted to do.
01:15:13 So you'd make artsy faggots shit and off to worry about the money because you're already
01:15:18 rich.
01:15:19 No.
01:15:20 He's trying to get around saying yes, but we all do.
01:15:26 What I'm saying is that I'm not saying that I would make super artsy shit.
01:15:33 I'm saying that the games I would make would be small and not.
01:15:38 I wouldn't make sprawling RPGs or platforms.
01:15:43 Are we talking like Tower of Heaven here and that kind of shit?
01:15:45 I don't have a dream game project that I make.
01:15:49 I just did something I'd like to dabble in.
01:15:51 That's all I'm saying.
01:15:52 All right.
01:15:53 That's cool.
01:15:54 I want to mention, in my version of Homestuck, since I'm the main character I'm replacing
01:15:59 John, John Vriska, it's going to be canon.
01:16:01 It's going to be the entire, as soon as she ends the story, it's going to be the whole
01:16:04 thing.
01:16:05 But you said John Vriska is going to be canon?
01:16:07 Oh, because it's you now.
01:16:08 Okay.
01:16:09 I got you.
01:16:10 It's going to be the whole thing.
01:16:11 It's going to be just 300 million thousand pages of me and Vriska just kissing the concert.
01:16:17 I'd read that for a dollar.
01:16:20 Now this is how I know you guys are all gay because when this guy said what kind of project
01:16:24 you want to do, you immediately thought art project, when there are far more important
01:16:27 projects to get done.
01:16:28 Let me tell you what I would do.
01:16:29 Yeah, but I don't care about the truth.
01:16:30 Let me tell you what I would fucking do if I had all the time, money, and resources
01:16:34 to do it, which are already available.
01:16:36 Star Trekking.
01:16:37 I would work.
01:16:38 We need a warp drive, guys.
01:16:40 We need a warp drive because right now this planet is a ticking time bomb and humanity's
01:16:45 existence is at stake.
01:16:47 We've only got, who knows, millions of years, thousands of years, 10 years.
01:16:51 I don't know.
01:16:52 We work on our space program.
01:16:53 We need to colonize other planets.
01:16:54 We need to fucking get out there under the stars because I don't want humanity to die
01:16:58 like a punk on one tiny ass planet.
01:17:01 We need a warp drive.
01:17:02 That's the number one thing we need.
01:17:04 Nate, I hear what you're saying, but I think the right answer is to build Trump's wall.
01:17:10 Once we solve the immigrant crisis, the warp drives are going to fall from the fucking sky.
01:17:14 God will then understand that we've done his bidding and will just give it to us because
01:17:18 that's-
01:17:19 We need to nuke all of Europe and then we'll probably be safe.
01:17:23 Sorry, mate.
01:17:24 You've got to be sacrificed for the greater good.
01:17:25 Yeah.
01:17:26 I'll also get-
01:17:27 Not if I sacrifice you first.
01:17:29 Right, you know.
01:17:31 Is England also, Gabe, you'd know this, is England building a wall between itself and
01:17:36 Europe as well?
01:17:37 It already has a wall.
01:17:38 It's like the fucking-
01:17:39 It's called the ocean, isn't it?
01:17:41 It's the ocean.
01:17:42 They're an island.
01:17:43 Yeah, but that's not impressive.
01:17:44 No, they need to cave in that tunnel.
01:17:46 Yeah, that's right.
01:17:48 There's an undersea tunnel, right?
01:17:50 I don't think so.
01:17:51 The channel, dog.
01:17:52 The channel tunnel thing.
01:17:53 Yeah, there is.
01:17:54 No, you're right.
01:17:55 You're right.
01:17:56 Back me up.
01:17:57 Yeah.
01:17:58 He's gone.
01:17:59 Do you live in the channel, Gabe?
01:18:00 Is that where you are right now?
01:18:03 What happened?
01:18:04 There's a tube, right?
01:18:06 There's a tube between France and England.
01:18:07 He's asking if the tunnel exists between England and France.
01:18:10 Yes, there's a train that goes called the Eurostar.
01:18:12 I've gone on it a couple times.
01:18:14 In fact, I've gone on it like eight years ago.
01:18:16 Nailed the little boy.
01:18:17 Nailed the little boy.
01:18:18 Hey, we're two minutes to midnight.
01:18:20 Okay, thank God, because I'm just filling time here, folks.
01:18:23 We're filling time.
01:18:24 Can we squeeze in one more question?
01:18:25 I wasn't joking when I said I had to pee at the very beginning.
01:18:29 We probably can.
01:18:31 How do you deal?
01:18:32 Okay, by at I Like Serial 421, how do you deal with creative dry spells
01:18:37 when you have people constantly wanting new content?
01:18:39 I don't know.
01:18:40 I ignore them.
01:18:41 You get depressed and you curl up and you turn on the shower.
01:18:44 I don't have that problem because my projects take so long
01:18:46 that I never lose ideas.
01:18:48 You're saying the shower until you die.
01:18:50 I don't give a fuck about people wanting new content.
01:18:53 The one that wants the content to be done more than anyone else is me.
01:18:57 It's only me that I'm a coward.
01:18:58 Maybe he means to best succeed, feed the algorithm or any of that shit.
01:19:03 Well, there's two options.
01:19:05 You either just do it anyway or you do something else instead.
01:19:08 Okay, we're getting close here.
01:19:09 Usually what I do is I distract myself by making a give and take video.
01:19:13 Yeah, that's what I mean.
01:19:15 If you got something you want to do, you either do it anyway or you do something else.
01:19:22 Who's watching the bombs?
01:19:23 I'm getting rid of Europe right now.
01:19:28 What's our time?
01:19:29 We got seconds?
01:19:30 23.
01:19:31 I don't have seconds.
01:19:32 Let me see.
01:19:33 We're like one minute away.
01:19:35 No, it's midnight for me.
01:19:37 You guys are in the same time zone?
01:19:40 Yeah.
01:19:41 They should be.
01:19:42 They're in England, dog.
01:19:44 Wait, is it?
01:19:45 Wait.
01:19:46 In England it is.
01:19:47 Here we go.
01:19:48 For me, it's a few seconds behind, all right?
01:19:51 Count it down.
01:19:52 Five, four, three, two, one.
01:20:00 We did it.
01:20:02 We did it.
01:20:03 Hippo, how many celebrities are dead in 2017?
01:20:05 100 million.
01:20:06 Oh, thank God.
01:20:07 I'm hoping more die this year.
01:20:10 All right.
01:20:11 That's it.
01:20:12 Thanks for that.
01:20:13 Man, that was great timing.
01:20:14 So we're ready to wrap it up.
01:20:15 Thanks for listening, everybody.
01:20:17 Thanks, everybody, for asking questions.
01:20:19 Make sure you tweet us.
01:20:20 If you got, this was a different one.
01:20:22 This wasn't a topic that we took from anybody.
01:20:24 Actually, some people did say talk about 2017.
01:20:26 But tweet us at tpcrastinators throughout the week with ideas for
01:20:31 things that we'd talk about next week's show.
01:20:33 And also, when we record every week, we put out a tweet that says,
01:20:37 ask us questions.
01:20:38 You know, we responded this fucking tweet with questions and we'll
01:20:42 answer them as we did right here.
01:20:44 So if you want to do that shit, go to the Twitter at tpcrastinators.
01:20:47 Send us shit.
01:20:48 Thanks for listening, everybody.
01:20:49 And we'll see you next week.
01:20:50 Bye-bye.
01:20:51 Bye-bye.
01:20:53 Happy news.
01:21:38 What the hell is wrong with me?
01:21:40 I'm supposed to be making money.
01:21:46 I'm supposed to be creating funny.
01:21:51 Think that the people gladly will pay for artistic genius.
01:21:59 That's what they came for.
01:22:02 Instead, I'm tweeting, hashtag repeating.
01:22:07 That's why there's no heat and holes in the ceiling.
01:22:14 Yeah, it's quite the burden.
01:22:18 It's a hard knock life, being a genius.
