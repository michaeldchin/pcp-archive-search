00:00:00 Hey, hey, hey, hello everybody and welcome back to Rickstie Minutes. I'm the best guy ever and this is Digibro.
00:00:06 Hey, I don't give a fuck, bitch. What's this? Episode 9?
00:00:11 This is episode 9 of season 3. That's right, my dude.
00:00:13 Awesome.
00:00:15 The ABCs of Beth. The ABCs of Beth.
00:00:18 This is our first, man, this is a game changer. And then in some ways, there's a game changer here.
00:00:24 This is probably one of my favorite episodes of the show.
00:00:30 I thought you might go that way. That's interesting. That's interesting.
00:00:33 Because this was probably the biggest core plot development we've gotten in outside of the Council of Rakes and all the sci-fi stuff for the home life.
00:00:45 This is the biggest development we've gotten since the first TV episode.
00:00:52 Absolutely correct. You know what's interesting? I think I'll probably have a slightly different interpretation of that about that same exact idea.
00:00:59 But why don't you tell us about it, did you? What went down?
00:01:02 Well, basically we learn about Beth's past and exactly who she is, which is something I think this show, I don't know if it's ever done a really great job of characterizing Beth.
00:01:14 I couldn't agree more. I couldn't not agree more.
00:01:16 I've always liked her, but she's always been kind of in the background.
00:01:22 The main focus has always been her relationship with Jerry and how that changed her.
00:01:28 But this is the first time we learned exactly what she would be without Jerry or who she was before that.
00:01:36 The thing about Beth is that while Beth was a better person, a more interesting person than Jerry,
00:01:43 her entire character arc depended upon Jerry and Jerry is the worst.
00:01:49 So in what way could we possibly care about Beth considering that's the crux of her character.
00:01:55 There was just no way. There was just no way.
00:01:57 And that was a problem I was feeling throughout this season, which is that with them finally having broken up, Beth has not had much to do.
00:02:06 She's just kind of been on this downward spiral of being weird.
00:02:11 Most of the times we cut to her, she's just being fucking weird.
00:02:16 But then in this episode, we get context into that weirdness that maybe she's just always been a fucking weirdo.
00:02:24 Maybe dating Jerry was just a way of putting on a facade of normalcy in her life.
00:02:31 I feel like they were building to this episode with this season so far. I think that was inevitable.
00:02:37 Yeah, I think if we were to sort of figure out why in terms of her characterization, why this is.
00:02:42 Yeah, I would say it's because Jerry is gone. She no longer feels this need to, I don't know, be a placated mom kind of dude, I guess.
00:02:50 Something like that. I honestly feel like that's giving it maybe a little bit more credit than it deserves.
00:02:55 But nonetheless, I certainly enjoyed what we've seen transposed, fucking happened this episode.
00:03:01 That's the word I meant to say, happened.
00:03:03 Transpire.
00:03:05 That's the word I was looking for. Thank you.
00:03:08 So, yeah, this is an episode about, really, it's a, what was the B plot?
00:03:15 Right, Jerry.
00:03:16 Jerry and the fuck.
00:03:17 Fuck this alien girl.
00:03:18 Which was hilarious.
00:03:19 He was fucking her. He was fucking her. He knew she had two vaginas. That's cool. That's cool.
00:03:24 I like, that was a great subplot, but obviously the less relevant half of the episode.
00:03:31 Of course.
00:03:32 So, basically, we learn this interesting back and forth that Rick was, in many ways, a terrible father.
00:03:42 But also because he, like, I guess from a young age, he had already corrupted Beth to be just as bad.
00:03:51 Or she just naturally is, she's pretty, she, as he put it, you were a scary fucking kid.
00:03:58 And everything she ever wanted from him was stuff to make people like her.
00:04:02 But it's very apparent that the reason she had those issues was, like, out of abandonment issues over her father.
00:04:08 But, like, to this extreme degree that is clearly, like, something's wrong with her.
00:04:14 No doubt. No doubt.
00:04:15 You know?
00:04:16 Like, it's not just the daddy issues.
00:04:18 Those are, like, just the catalyst for releasing what is already psychopathy.
00:04:24 Yeah, it kind of seems that way.
00:04:27 Though I kind of want to give her a break on that a little bit, because I really do feel like, I don't know,
00:04:33 I really do want to attach it to, oh, okay, you know what, I don't want to give her that much of a break,
00:04:37 but I really want to come down on Rick for just being clearly the worst.
00:04:41 Because all the things that he, when he goes through, they go through, like, this, not montage,
00:04:45 but he just pulls out from this toolbox all the things he had made for, all these, like, crazy, goofy devices that, like, a child might want.
00:04:52 And then they get, like, darker, just, like, a sentient switchblade.
00:04:55 Like, okay, that's kind of weird, why would you want that?
00:04:57 But, um, like, those are things I could really see most kids asking for,
00:05:03 but the thing is, parents know better than to give their children them.
00:05:06 And they know, no, that's when you have to be a parent to tell them no.
00:05:10 And, like, I almost want to blame it fucking all on Rick.
00:05:13 I don't really know how responsible that is.
00:05:16 You have to say it's all his fault, because he's the fucking parent.
00:05:19 She was a kid.
00:05:20 Yeah, yeah.
00:05:21 Like, and obviously he was just placating her because, like, I can easily imagine that Rick, in the brief moments he was around his daughter,
00:05:30 she would ask him for something and he would churn it out in a couple of seconds, hand it to her and fuck off.
00:05:36 Right.
00:05:37 And be like, this is enough, you know?
00:05:38 Which is why he creates an entire other universe for her, which she grows up to believe is, like, was just in her imagination.
00:05:46 Yeah, that was good.
00:05:47 He creates a whole world for her to enjoy.
00:05:49 And, like, it's really, I really love the scene of Rick, like, going through this world and, like, explaining about how, like, carefully he constructed it to be perfect for her.
00:06:00 That was one of the best things in the episode.
00:06:02 I loved it.
00:06:03 Yeah, that it's just such a weird, like, obviously he's at fault here.
00:06:07 Obviously this is all a bad idea and Beth is right, but he really did try his hardest.
00:06:13 Like, he did the best that Rick could as a broken, terrible man to make a perfect place for his daughter.
00:06:20 But just the attention to detail, I mean, like, that is something that I absolutely would have noticed that, like, well, okay, dude, so, okay, you made the grounds squishy great,
00:06:30 but there's a river right there, she could easily drown.
00:06:32 But no, it's fucking breathable water, it's not a problem.
00:06:35 He thought of all, like, the reasonable things.
00:06:38 And the only problem is that, you know, like, a kid lived there for a million years and fucked the whole place up.
00:06:42 So, well, the biggest problem is that the entire conceit is wrong.
00:06:46 Well, you know, it's no way to deal with your children problems.
00:06:49 It's like if somebody, like, didn't, wait, I'm trying to think of a good analogy here.
00:06:56 Like, if you wanted to build a better toilet and instead you built, like, the greatest sink in the universe,
00:07:04 like, it doesn't help the problem that you need to shit, you know?
00:07:08 Yeah, I suppose.
00:07:09 That's kind of what he's done here, is, like, the problem is that she needs her dad,
00:07:13 not that she needs this, it doesn't matter how perfect you made it,
00:07:16 it doesn't matter that you were the most considerate person in the world about how you designed this place.
00:07:22 It was the wrong thing to make in the first place.
00:07:25 Very true, very true.
00:07:27 And that's sort of the argument between them, and I thought that was really great.
00:07:30 Yeah, Rick, Rick should take some more responsibility, I think.
00:07:34 But on the other hand, so basically all their grievances are like from when she was a kid,
00:07:39 these days she's a pretty together person, for the most part, until she has some of these moments later on,
00:07:45 where she really, she lets the facade fall away and she embraces her monster mode, which I enjoyed.
00:07:51 I mean, I think that's probably the real reason she's been with Jerry all this time,
00:07:58 because now that we're looking at it from this lens of, because we've seen that in the alternate universe,
00:08:05 where Beth and Jerry weren't together, they both become way more successful,
00:08:10 but they also go insane and go down like a crazy rabbit hole of depravity and end up together anyways.
00:08:18 In this episode, we get the sense that if Beth had never had Jerry around, would she ever have gotten anyone?
00:08:27 It's the only reason she ever got someone to be around her, because he was so weak-willed
00:08:33 that he could put up with the fact that she's an insane person.
00:08:37 Here's this woman who's like a psycho bitch, and who would possibly want to be with her other than the weakest man in the world,
00:08:46 and there's a reason they were together for so long.
00:08:49 She's afraid to have to be by herself, because we see now what happens.
00:08:53 If she doesn't have Jerry, she ain't exactly getting out there in the dating pool and making new friends.
00:08:58 She's just being a fucking insane person in her house, building statues out of hoops and shit.
00:09:05 And of course, there's just the practical fact that she got knocked up, and then had some kids,
00:09:10 and that's going to fucking weigh you down.
00:09:13 Yeah, that too.
00:09:15 I was just before we recorded this, I was watching a video by a guy called The Matching Ties Network
00:09:22 called Harman and Jerry and Rick.
00:09:25 He was basically creating the idea that Dan Harman writes a ton of himself into Rick and Jerry,
00:09:32 and apparently in between seasons two and three of Rick and Morty,
00:09:37 he married his longtime girlfriend and got divorced in the span of about three months,
00:09:43 and up until the start of season three, the way Beth and Jerry's marriage was always portrayed
00:09:48 was that they weren't just staying together for the kids.
00:09:52 There was other reasons. There was this deeper connection between them.
00:09:56 There was some destiny shit going on, a little bit.
00:09:58 But then you start season three and they immediately get divorced,
00:10:01 and so I have to wonder if this is also Dan Harman exploring his own divorce in this season.
00:10:08 What an excellent point, and I think it probably is.
00:10:12 It's interesting to see that change in mindset that maybe by the end of the season
00:10:19 we'll find out that they do need to get back together, who knows.
00:10:22 Maybe they'll just keep exploring being separate for seasons on end
00:10:27 and we'll just have this broken home that we're following,
00:10:30 which honestly is kind of a great idea.
00:10:33 How many sitcoms have we seen about a dysfunctional but still together family?
00:10:39 What if we just have a show about a family that's broken up
00:10:43 and everyone's slowly getting jaded to crazy space adventures?
00:10:48 We're at a point now where Jerry is dating an alien of his own accord.
00:10:52 Was it just me or was that...
00:10:54 I mean, I know that the Earth had been enslaved by aliens,
00:10:57 but they're basically all gone and it's just human society again
00:11:00 and we're pretty much ignoring that.
00:11:02 But there's just an alien and nobody gives a fuck.
00:11:04 This is just common now. This is the life everyone's involved with.
00:11:08 Did they go... When they ate with the alien, was that the same diner
00:11:13 that we went to not only in the last episode
00:11:17 when Rick had to kill the alien that wanted to die,
00:11:21 but also the start of the season when they were just in a family diner?
00:11:25 Is it the same diner?
00:11:26 No, no, no, no. That was a different one.
00:11:28 That was Chonies, Chauncees. That was definitely a different one.
00:11:31 This place was, what do they say, Mexican something?
00:11:34 No, this is like a Japanese place.
00:11:36 No, okay, that was different because that place was like...
00:11:38 It was like a taco place.
00:11:39 Right, there was sushi here.
00:11:40 Yeah, that's right.
00:11:41 You should know that. You're the biggest.
00:11:43 There's a lot of restaurants in the fucking...
00:11:45 in Rick and Morty now that I think about it.
00:11:46 It's true.
00:11:47 And you hate restaurant scenes. God damn it, this is the worst.
00:11:50 Zero out of ten.
00:11:51 This is exposition, yes.
00:11:53 But no, it's great.
00:11:55 Jerry's subplot with the alien chick was fucking hilarious.
00:11:58 It was pretty good.
00:12:00 It's just such a Jerry...
00:12:02 Well, what made it work for me was the fact that Jerry has telekinetic powers as a result of this.
00:12:08 Which is fucking...
00:12:10 That moment when they walk into his house and he just like...
00:12:13 Not only is everything nice, but he has telekinetic powers.
00:12:16 I was just like, whoa, hold on.
00:12:18 I love that. I loved how they rolled with it.
00:12:21 But I must admit, I thought there would be like...
00:12:24 The other shoe would drop on that somewhere in the episode
00:12:27 and just was never mentioned again.
00:12:29 Never came up again.
00:12:30 But I don't know, it wasn't that big a deal, but I did expect something.
00:12:33 Whatever, who cares.
00:12:35 That was great though.
00:12:36 Why didn't he use it to help on the hunt?
00:12:38 Why didn't he fight with psychic powers?
00:12:40 Maybe he wasn't getting enough pus.
00:12:42 He didn't have enough juice left, he wasn't getting enough.
00:12:44 They were hunting too much.
00:12:45 After they feast, they hunt, and then they hunt to celebrate their hunts.
00:12:48 This episode had so many fucking zingers in it, man.
00:12:53 I don't even know where to begin, but there's a few that I can remember.
00:12:58 I'd have to watch the episode again and write them all down to get all the great ones.
00:13:02 But two of my favorites, at the beginning of the episode,
00:13:06 when Beth says something about the generation gap,
00:13:10 and Summer's like, our generation gets traumatized for breakfast.
00:13:16 Yeah, that's the one.
00:13:17 That was great. That was a dope summer line.
00:13:19 Yeah, which is totally accurate.
00:13:23 And then later on when they're chastising Jerry about how they say,
00:13:29 they're like, we chose mom, we made that very clear to you,
00:13:33 both at the breakup and in your weird Facebook post,
00:13:37 the comments of your long Facebook post or whatever.
00:13:40 That was great.
00:13:41 Because it creates, you can imagine a whole other scene
00:13:46 that's left out of the show of them going on Facebook
00:13:50 and seeing Jerry having typed this wall of text about the breakup
00:13:55 that no one cares about and them leaving angry responses.
00:13:58 This kind of shit happens in my family.
00:14:00 Of course.
00:14:01 Someone gets upset and goes on a fucking Facebook tirade
00:14:05 and everyone else blasts them in the comments of it.
00:14:07 I've been through that particular drama, so it's too perfect.
00:14:11 Blinds are like that, man.
00:14:13 I know what you mean.
00:14:14 The thing that was the funniest to me in this episode
00:14:17 was just how gross everyone was willing to be all the time.
00:14:21 So first of all, there was just like the Jerry scene
00:14:24 where he wants them to know real explicitly
00:14:28 how much he's fucking this bitch.
00:14:30 Is that relatable, did you?
00:14:31 You gotta let everybody know how much you're fucking.
00:14:33 Are you getting anything from that?
00:14:34 Okay, anyway.
00:14:35 But later on, the running joke of the dude in Fruppy Land,
00:14:42 just insisting upon explaining to everyone in extreme detail
00:14:46 and displaying for them the fucking ritual of him impregnating
00:14:49 these fucking monsters and devouring the bodies.
00:14:52 His insistence upon explaining this to everyone
00:14:55 every fucking time, I laugh my ass off.
00:14:58 That was the funniest thing this episode.
00:14:59 What made that work for me so much is that like,
00:15:02 because Rick and Beth do that thing where they rapidly extrapolate
00:15:07 that that's what's going on here.
00:15:09 They immediately figure that out.
00:15:11 Oh, yeah, of course.
00:15:12 While I thought that line was funny because of just what they're saying,
00:15:16 I was a little bit annoyed by the overly meta.
00:15:19 When this show does that thing where everyone's just too far ahead of the story,
00:15:23 and I'm like, okay, they don't have to all be maximum nihilism 24-7.
00:15:30 But then to then be explained over and over again made it way funnier.
00:15:36 Oh, it was fucking great.
00:15:38 It was fucking great.
00:15:39 And he does it.
00:15:40 He fucks it right in front of them.
00:15:42 It has a baby and he eats it in front of them.
00:15:45 Even Rick is like, dude, please stop.
00:15:47 No one, like, this is too much.
00:15:49 I don't want to think about this happening.
00:15:51 Oh, it was great.
00:15:52 God, I fucking love it.
00:15:53 I love that he just books right after that.
00:15:54 He's like, all right, I'm done.
00:15:56 That was fantastic.
00:15:58 That was fantastic.
00:16:00 Oh, man.
00:16:01 It was great that Rick, you know, again, like, he's a god.
00:16:04 He just like, yeah, okay, I don't want to be here anymore,
00:16:06 so I'm leaving and then he does.
00:16:08 And then Beth has to go and, you know, bumble fuck around
00:16:10 and try to deal with the situation on her own.
00:16:12 Yeah, it was great, man.
00:16:14 It was great.
00:16:15 Should we talk more about the Fruityland plots,
00:16:17 the whole, the things that went on there?
00:16:19 Yeah, it's an interesting, I love the,
00:16:24 I guess it all really culminates in the moment
00:16:26 where Beth realizes that she is her father.
00:16:28 Yep.
00:16:29 Because she, just as Rick will not take responsibility
00:16:32 for the fact that he made Beth this person,
00:16:35 she will not take responsibility for the fact
00:16:37 that she made Tommy this person.
00:16:40 True.
00:16:41 By pushing him into the honey.
00:16:42 And all, all he wants is an apology
00:16:45 and she would rather murder everyone
00:16:47 than give that apology.
00:16:49 And yeah, and then she like realizes,
00:16:52 she kind of has an awakening moment of like,
00:16:55 I need to stop lying to myself
00:16:57 and admit I'm a fucking monster.
00:16:59 Yeah.
00:17:00 Just like Rick, you know.
00:17:01 Especially that coming right up to the scene
00:17:02 where she's like, no, I'm going to go prove
00:17:03 that I'm not a bad person, that I am a good person.
00:17:05 And it's like, you just found out,
00:17:06 objectively not a good person.
00:17:08 You're kind of a fucking monster.
00:17:10 It's great.
00:17:11 It's great.
00:17:12 And I mean, they still rescue the dad
00:17:13 because they're like, you know,
00:17:15 we can do some good here.
00:17:17 Like does the world really want Tommy back in it
00:17:19 at this point, considering what he is?
00:17:21 No.
00:17:22 No.
00:17:23 They should have just left him there.
00:17:24 Like fuck it.
00:17:25 Then again, would it be?
00:17:26 They did just leave him there.
00:17:27 They cloned him.
00:17:28 I think she murdered him also.
00:17:29 I mean, the guy's got to be dead, right?
00:17:31 That was implied.
00:17:32 I assume she killed the real Tommy
00:17:33 and they cloned him into a new one.
00:17:35 Of course.
00:17:36 Of course.
00:17:37 Yeah, that's fine.
00:17:38 That plot line's resolved.
00:17:39 It's all good.
00:17:40 It's all good.
00:17:41 Yeah.
00:17:42 I also liked the, this was a very subtle detail
00:17:44 that I thought was really cool about Fruity Land.
00:17:46 So like at one point, Rick's like talking about
00:17:48 like how, you know, how hard he worked to making,
00:17:50 how hard he worked to like make Fruity Land and stuff.
00:17:52 And like, you know, they use the magic chalk,
00:17:54 like chalk zone to like, you know, draw a thing
00:17:56 and then walk in and make magic doorways and shit.
00:17:58 I thought it was really cool that this is just one
00:18:00 of those subtle details.
00:18:01 Like at one point he's just like,
00:18:02 ah, I collapsed a whole quasar to fucking
00:18:04 and Beth just cuts him out like,
00:18:05 dad, I don't give a fuck about how you made it.
00:18:07 Like just take me there.
00:18:08 I don't give a fuck.
00:18:09 And he's just like, ah, fucking bitch.
00:18:11 And then like later on in the episode,
00:18:13 he's like, okay, you know, we left that guy's dead.
00:18:16 Time to like pull the plug.
00:18:17 And then he like, he makes a gesture as if he's going to like
00:18:20 snap the little piece of chalk thing that he's got.
00:18:22 But then Beth stops him and I was just like,
00:18:24 hey, that's cool.
00:18:25 Like, so that's, so basically we're learning that
00:18:27 it's a pocket dimension maybe contained within that thing.
00:18:29 Or that's like some power source to it or something.
00:18:32 I don't know.
00:18:33 I just thought that was a cool little detail.
00:18:34 I liked it.
00:18:35 Always in with the details in this show, man.
00:18:37 Yep.
00:18:38 Lots of great, lots of great stuff.
00:18:40 I love all the inventions that he gave Beth
00:18:42 and how long they let that scene go on.
00:18:44 Yeah, yeah.
00:18:45 Like he just lists this shit for so long
00:18:47 and it was like each thing's funnier than the last.
00:18:49 It's one of those, it's one of those Andy Kaufman jokes
00:18:51 where they just keep going and the joke is that
00:18:53 it just keeps going and you need to get comfortable
00:18:55 with the fact that this is not stopping anytime soon.
00:18:57 And I think it, I think it worked really well
00:18:59 because I felt like it kept giving slightly different angles on it.
00:19:03 Like it wasn't just Beth as a psycho.
00:19:06 It's like each item you can imagine it's particular use.
00:19:09 This was a great way to like in, like in my mind,
00:19:12 I'm crafting a flashback that is not actually being shown,
00:19:16 you know, and there's the stage play flashback,
00:19:19 which is also fucking hilarious.
00:19:21 They're just like literally describing what happened.
00:19:24 Like in no uncertain terms.
00:19:27 I think Rick's just criticizing the screenwriting.
00:19:32 Yeah, that was great.
00:19:33 That was great.
00:19:34 I also really liked when Beth just walks back in,
00:19:37 you know, after covered in blood after killing everybody there
00:19:39 and she walks in on Rick, you know, tune his guitar, do do, do do do
00:19:43 and then later on he's like they do a musical montage
00:19:46 to the do do in my butt.
00:19:48 Oh my God.
00:19:49 The musical, that was the moment where the episode was like,
00:19:52 this is now one of my favorite of the show,
00:19:55 because we just have like, we have this really emotional dialogue
00:19:59 and then the emotional montage is immediately do do in my butthole
00:20:04 and I was like, done.
00:20:06 10 out of 10.
00:20:07 Every daughter's a butthole in her dad's butt in one point in his life.
00:20:11 Yeah, it was good shit, man.
00:20:13 It was good shit.
00:20:15 That's kind of humor I can really resonate with.
00:20:18 Yeah, that's my kind of humor, right?
00:20:20 That's what I come to Rick and Morty for.
00:20:22 Everyone's always like, anyone who criticizes this show
00:20:25 and they're like, ooh, it's just a guy burping
00:20:27 and talking about nihilism, no.
00:20:29 What makes Rick and Morty funny is the do do in my butt song.
00:20:34 Agreed.
00:20:35 That is like, the fact that they put that as the cherry on top
00:20:39 of the inner depth, you know,
00:20:41 that we get this beautiful episode with all this story
00:20:44 like fucking deep shit about the relationship of these characters
00:20:47 and the big climactic sign off of it is the do do in my butthole song.
00:20:52 That's why I love this show.
00:20:54 Yeah.
00:20:55 Yeah, man.
00:20:56 Which I barely heard the lyrics of because I was laughing over the entire time.
00:21:01 I went back and listened to it again.
00:21:03 Yeah, it was fucking great.
00:21:04 So let's talk about the ending.
00:21:06 So after that scene that, you know,
00:21:08 Beth's come to a realization that she's a fucking monster
00:21:11 and Rick's just like, she's like, what should I do, Dad?
00:21:13 You know, got no more excuses to hang around here.
00:21:15 There's nothing to hold me here.
00:21:16 What the fuck do I do?
00:21:17 And Rick's like, fucking peace out, dog.
00:21:19 Peace out.
00:21:20 I will make you a clone.
00:21:21 It will do everything that you did in your life.
00:21:23 You got no attachments.
00:21:24 You can be completely free.
00:21:25 No moral ramifications of any kind.
00:21:28 What are you going to do?
00:21:29 And then they don't answer it, but it's obvious.
00:21:31 It's obvious that she's gone.
00:21:33 That's okay.
00:21:34 That was, yeah, it was a weird scene that they didn't show that because like,
00:21:40 it definitely feels super stilted when she comes back into the room.
00:21:44 She's acting like a clone.
00:21:46 Yep.
00:21:47 Like she's acting.
00:21:48 She's acting a lot like the summer and Morty bots from episode two.
00:21:52 Exactly.
00:21:53 So I was thinking, okay, it's a clone.
00:21:55 We're about to get the reveal, but then there is no reveal.
00:21:59 And I don't know if that's just to trick us for now.
00:22:03 Like, or just to leave the question unanswered.
00:22:06 Like we won't really know unless we see Beth off somewhere else later.
00:22:10 You know.
00:22:11 I think that that is a almost guaranteed to happen.
00:22:16 I just, okay, just like narratively as, as the narrative genius that I am,
00:22:21 I don't see how they could get away with putting that in this episode
00:22:25 and then not having to pay off like at some point in the future.
00:22:28 I expected it to be at the end of the episode and like the after credits thing.
00:22:31 That's the thing.
00:22:32 If that's what they did this, I don't think there's ever been a time in this show
00:22:36 where they set up something like that, that didn't pay off within the episode.
00:22:39 You know, I guess you could argue that.
00:22:40 Evil Morty thing, but like that was a, that was like a setup for something later.
00:22:44 So yeah, we all knew that.
00:22:46 That was like, that was like an ending like clincher thing though.
00:22:49 And like we never knew like what this, like what was going to be the relevance of that
00:22:54 until much later.
00:22:55 This one, it just feels like, like the way that they ended the episode is clearly meant
00:23:01 to suggest, hey, she didn't clone herself, but then you have that or did she in your mind
00:23:07 and like, I don't know, maybe it pays off next episode.
00:23:11 If it doesn't pay off by the end of the season, I'm going to get real skeptical.
00:23:14 But if they suddenly in season like four brought in this other Beth,
00:23:19 it would be a fucking pretty big sledgehammer to the face.
00:23:22 I will say that.
00:23:23 You know, I think it would be like, oh, you motherfuckers, you held off for that long.
00:23:27 You know, my genre savvy-ness just to me, it almost gives me no way to believe
00:23:33 that they are, that she didn't leave.
00:23:35 Knowing the show and knowing how these characters operate, I cannot imagine a world in which
00:23:41 they wrote it that summer or that Beth indeed stayed.
00:23:44 And maybe that's how they're going to fuck guys like me over who think that we know everything
00:23:48 about the show.
00:23:49 Maybe it'll happen because this show, I mean, there's no way that they just go with the
00:23:54 obvious thing on its face.
00:23:56 Like there's that kind of show.
00:23:57 And then there's a more complex show that would do something on top of it.
00:24:02 And then there's like double triple layers on top of that where they could interweave
00:24:06 plots and double back on your expectations and totally surprise you out of nowhere.
00:24:10 And Rick and Morty sometimes transcends to that level.
00:24:13 And the biggest way they could defy all expectations is to indeed have Beth not leave after setting
00:24:19 up that whole scene.
00:24:20 So we're just going to have to find out.
00:24:22 I guess we've got nothing we can do.
00:24:24 Yeah.
00:24:25 We'll see.
00:24:26 And we will not be able to save 100% sure until the show is over.
00:24:30 That's true.
00:24:31 Even then.
00:24:32 Even then.
00:24:33 Yeah.
00:24:34 Even then it's up for debate.
00:24:36 Yeah.
00:24:37 Yeah.
00:24:38 Well, I guess that's all I have to say about this episode.
00:24:41 The ending gag was hilarious.
00:24:43 It was.
00:24:44 The fact that Rick went and fucked Jerry's girlfriend.
00:24:47 Oh, that was the best part of it.
00:24:49 That was the best part.
00:24:52 And yeah, the meta about like nobody uses answering machines before.
00:24:55 You can keep it, whatever.
00:24:56 Got to chuckle out of me.
00:24:58 But I did have one final point I wanted to make about this episode.
00:25:01 And it was just that.
00:25:02 So you were quite positive about all this Beth development happening.
00:25:06 I for one, as a portion of that.
00:25:09 Okay.
00:25:10 I felt a little bit deflated by this happening.
00:25:15 And it's just because.
00:25:16 Okay.
00:25:17 So in this episode, we have Beth finally realizing things, all these things about Rick and herself
00:25:23 to be fair that we didn't know.
00:25:24 But everything about Rick, we have all known since episode one.
00:25:28 There is nothing new on like the realization of this whole Rick situation.
00:25:32 So to me, it's a little bit of a mixed bag only because this is something that had to happen
00:25:38 inevitably in order to make this character at all interesting, but because it took so long
00:25:43 and it's been so much dead weight basically having this character along doing nothing for so long.
00:25:49 Like it's happening now.
00:25:50 It's like, okay, great.
00:25:51 But it's just like, okay, finally, finally, it's out of the way.
00:25:56 It's like a bowel movement.
00:25:57 You know, it's finally gone.
00:25:58 It's out of the way.
00:25:59 But man, that shit stinks.
00:26:01 And but I'm glad it's beyond this.
00:26:03 I don't know.
00:26:04 I don't want to shed it too much.
00:26:05 It's just, I wish this had happened sometime sooner or that Beth had just been more interesting
00:26:11 leading up to this point in some way.
00:26:13 Yeah.
00:26:14 But she really hadn't been.
00:26:15 Honestly, I think if you went back, she was most interesting in season one.
00:26:20 And definitely least interesting in season three.
00:26:23 So like, I think the problem has really been with this season not finding anything to do with her
00:26:29 because it was so much more interested in exploring Jerry's side of the breakup up until this point
00:26:34 and how the kids were dealing with it and just exploring Rick's being Rick, you know,
00:26:40 or doing weird stuff.
00:26:42 I kind of feel like why wasn't this episode just earlier in the season in a way,
00:26:46 but maybe it would have felt like too many like relationship episodes in a row.
00:26:51 I don't know.
00:26:52 But like it definitely feels like maybe it would be like maybe Beth's character won't
00:26:58 be as bad going back through the season now that we know this about her.
00:27:01 Yeah.
00:27:02 Like you can kind of put together a little bit more why like she's acting this way.
00:27:06 Because I think I think they probably had this in mind from the start of season three.
00:27:10 Like the way she's been acting this season is clearly indicative of this character.
00:27:15 They're painting in this episode.
00:27:16 I don't know how true I would say that is in the other seasons.
00:27:19 Yeah, I'm with you on that.
00:27:21 But like it'd be worth going back for a look.
00:27:25 But like, yeah, I see where you're coming from.
00:27:28 I do think it's unfortunate that it's taken this long for Beth to have a moment where like,
00:27:34 oh man, she might be cool now or I'm a lot more invested in her than I was before, you know.
00:27:40 I certainly feel that having this episode end.
00:27:43 But additionally, I do want to say there's a lot of hype here for Beth going out
00:27:48 and like becoming her own woman and, you know, doing stuff.
00:27:51 But like Beth's not that smart.
00:27:54 I feel like there's a little bit of an exaggerated sense of like how cool things are going to be
00:27:58 with Beth now that she's out there.
00:28:00 I feel like she's just going to go like she's she's no Rick.
00:28:03 She is no Rick.
00:28:04 You know, she's not like a God genius or anything in the other alternate world.
00:28:07 She just became like a fucking famous horse surgeon.
00:28:10 You know, what's been holding her back there?
00:28:13 I don't know.
00:28:14 I mean, Rick has implied that she could have been a super genius.
00:28:20 But I don't know.
00:28:21 I don't know what she's going to do.
00:28:23 I mean, we've already seen Morty and Summer just by proximity to Rick gaining a lot of his like abilities.
00:28:30 You know, like they wouldn't survive very long by themselves, but they do have a lot more skills
00:28:35 than a normal person would.
00:28:36 You're not wrong about that.
00:28:37 You're not wrong about that.
00:28:39 Yeah.
00:28:40 So, you know what?
00:28:41 I'll withhold judgment on that.
00:28:42 Maybe they could do something interesting with her.
00:28:44 So, yeah, go to it, writers.
00:28:46 Make her interesting.
00:28:48 And I'll tell you the first thing they got to do is not have her stayed here.
00:28:52 She needs to have left.
00:28:53 She needs to have left.
00:28:54 Go be an adventurer.
00:28:55 Go do something cool.
00:28:56 That's what I hope is revealed.
00:28:58 And I think it will be this season.
00:28:59 That's all I got.
00:29:01 Alrighty.
00:29:02 That's a fuck, a fuck, a fuck, fuck.
00:29:06 Bye, everybody.
