00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another exciting, fantastic, jam-packed, dream-free episode of The
00:00:25 Pro Crastinators Podcast. Today we have with us my very best friend and newcomer to Instagram
00:00:41 LeelaloraMate. We got Hippocrit with us today.
00:00:50 Fine bone China. Sick. Sure, Nate is here.
00:01:00 Instagram.com slash bestguyever. Make me an ethernet juggernaut.
00:01:05 It's bestest guy ever. Shit, it is bestest guy ever. Thank you, Tom.
00:01:09 Don't give that imposter who somehow got there first, the follow. Fuck that guy.
00:01:15 And we got Ben Saint. Hey everyone, it's me, professional gerrymanderist
00:01:20 Ben Saint here. You see those lines in the sand, those corrupt politicians drawn. I'm
00:01:29 here to change the whole system. We're reworking all this fucking shit.
00:01:33 I'm going to fulfill a number of useful functions, none of which I will specify.
00:01:40 Fantastic. Let's talk about Instagram, everybody.
00:01:43 Let's get into Instagram. I've been on Instagram for a while. I've actually kind of fallen out
00:01:47 of favor with it as well to a certain degree. But yeah, Instagram, Instagram's an interesting
00:01:52 beast. And I guess they're like changing up the entire algorithm that they've been using
00:01:57 for like this month, I guess. But it sounds like it's a good thing though, because like
00:02:01 the big thing that sucks about Instagram right now is that like, I like the platform a lot
00:02:06 and how it works, but the culture around Instagram is very normie and very fake.
00:02:12 Like it's very thoughty. Too many women. We've got to get rid of some of these women.
00:02:15 Yeah. All right. We're doing a good job. We're going to convince Mage to get off the platform.
00:02:19 So step one down. Let's instigate the Instagram execution
00:02:22 squads. I volunteer to lead this organization and I will serve you at your whim, fair viewers.
00:02:28 All right. That's me. Yeah. But the thing that really sucks about Instagram is just
00:02:31 that like it's it there's tons of the strategy on Instagram to like get big is like make
00:02:37 a repost account. Don't make any original content and then like pay for services to
00:02:42 like automatically to like inflate your account. Like that's a whole thing. There's like things
00:02:46 called power likes where like you get like big, big followers, like big accounts to like
00:02:51 your posts that helps you in the algorithm. And there's that or literally just be any
00:02:56 kind of reasonably attractive woman. And I'm pretty sure that's the only other way.
00:03:02 Women just automatically succeed on the internet. All right. We're not talking about women. We're
00:03:06 talking about like the superior gender that actually has to put effort into things.
00:03:10 Look, just think about this, everybody. Think about this. Endless Jess. Not to I don't think
00:03:15 this is too much information, but like he talked about once his younger sister or something
00:03:18 just had an Instagram. Think about all the stuff that Jesse has done and all that he's
00:03:23 created. And like his little sister on the basis of being a reasonably attractive girl
00:03:28 had like 10 times his following. I mean, yeah, sanity.
00:03:32 Of course, that's just how it works. It's just like attractive women appeal to literally
00:03:36 everyone. And that's not the case.
00:03:40 That patriarchal guy is keeping women down. God, they just can't get anywhere in this
00:03:45 society.
00:03:46 By the way, it's fine. And I accepted that and I will overcome these cruel women to
00:03:50 tell me to get one over on beat them all. Yeah. Okay. But mage, mage, you have the floor.
00:03:55 Tell us your grievances with this platform. Okay, I created Instagram literally just like
00:04:00 a few minutes ago. Wow.
00:04:02 It was my Instagram.
00:04:04 Oh my God.
00:04:06 You guys.
00:04:08 I'm sorry, mage, mage is like, like on a flight tomorrow or something or leaving and she has
00:04:14 no patience for her shenanigans today.
00:04:17 Patience today. We have work to do by that. I mean, we need to communicate like friends
00:04:23 that we are. Come on.
00:04:25 It's just such a burden.
00:04:32 Why do you hate Instagram?
00:04:34 Yeah, yeah. So I created my account just literally a few moments ago just because I needed to
00:04:38 upload a few images for I went to show people like a few images I took yesterday for a trip
00:04:44 I took that that might be a different topic for a little bit later and he was so late.
00:04:49 At first I couldn't figure out how to bulk upload from my phone and then I realized I
00:04:53 have to use the app. I couldn't just do it from the browser. And the reason I couldn't
00:04:59 I wasn't doing it from my computer is a I don't have the photos on my computer and I
00:05:04 don't have the time to upload it them on computer.
00:05:06 You can't upload anything from the computer anyways. It all has to be from the app.
00:05:09 Oh, that is.
00:05:11 Okay, one more reason why it sucks. I hate it.
00:05:14 So, yeah, so I figured out how to bulk upload and it's so tedious. You can only choose up
00:05:22 to 10 images per bulk and that's like shitty because I had like one, two, three, four, five,
00:05:28 six, like 70 or so images. And so that took a bit of time and it's like it's not enough
00:05:36 that I'm limited to 10 images. It's just like after that, after I choose the images, I have
00:05:42 to click next like three or four times and that's really obnoxious. I don't want to share
00:05:48 with anyone. I just want them to be there and I'll link people what I wanted.
00:05:52 It sounds like your problems with Instagram is that you're using Instagram like it's
00:05:57 flicker and it's not flicker.
00:05:59 I haven't used flicker. What's a flicker?
00:06:02 It's another site for sharing photographs, but it's more of just like an upload like
00:06:07 a repository just dump all your photos in. Yeah, it's like Imgur. It's like something
00:06:11 called Flickr.
00:06:12 Oh, okay. I'll look into that.
00:06:13 Instagram is more like a look at my tits, give me money.
00:06:17 Okay, well if I can show them that.
00:06:19 One more thing.
00:06:20 It's like an Apple product and it's really fancy and classy looking.
00:06:24 If it's an Apple product, why can't I install it from my Android? Android, you're doing it wrong.
00:06:31 It should be uninstallable. It's not like.
00:06:33 It's like you can deactivate it, but not uninstall it.
00:06:36 Whoa. I've never heard of Instagram being bloatware built into the OS on Android.
00:06:41 That's pretty cool.
00:06:42 It's for Samsung Galaxy S6 or something like that.
00:06:46 What?
00:06:47 Yeah.
00:06:48 I'm suspicious of this clay image. I'm suspicious. Are you sure that you aren't just making a
00:06:51 mistake?
00:06:52 No, I went to download it on, like I told you, I'm going to download it and then I look,
00:06:58 it's already downloaded. I just had to activate it and was like, whoa, shit.
00:07:02 Because a while ago I was on like deactivating and like deleting whatever apps I wasn't using.
00:07:10 And I guess I couldn't delete it, so I just deactivated it.
00:07:12 So, whoa.
00:07:13 That's weird.
00:07:14 Okay. One last thing. One last thing.
00:07:16 I super enraged that they didn't notice up until right now when I started looking through
00:07:20 the photos, they cropped the photos.
00:07:22 They cropped them to make them square.
00:07:24 I hate that.
00:07:25 Oh my God.
00:07:26 They ruined a lot of the photos.
00:07:28 At least not ruined the display.
00:07:30 That's that.
00:07:31 If it's ergonomic, that's just good visual design.
00:07:34 That's just good spatial reasoning.
00:07:36 Instagram to post their damn fucking, you know, their personal preference on a photo that you
00:07:43 tailor to be a different shape or size.
00:07:45 Come on.
00:07:46 It's a private company.
00:07:47 They can do whatever they want.
00:07:49 Of course.
00:07:50 I had actually heard that they like weren't doing that anymore, but I guess that's not
00:07:53 the case.
00:07:54 No, you can zoom out and have a, you know, a cuboid, a rectangular, that's the word,
00:08:03 picture.
00:08:04 Oh, so does it like just zoom in to make it into a square?
00:08:07 It zooms in to make it into a square and you can move it around to see which putt is
00:08:11 the square.
00:08:12 Well, you're uploading, but like I can customize 70 fucking photos into the span of five minutes,
00:08:18 you know?
00:08:19 Fair enough.
00:08:20 Fair enough.
00:08:21 You're using the wrong site.
00:08:22 I was told by a certain person to, it was named draft, but yeah, I guess I'll upload it
00:08:33 after the career if I have the time later on.
00:08:35 But yeah.
00:08:36 Okay.
00:08:37 As Instagram is a normie cesspool, I have had like kind of, I've had fun like being a
00:08:46 normie in that part of the internet and not having any trouble because there's not really
00:08:50 comments.
00:08:51 People don't really comment on anything and I can show it to a family and it's, you know,
00:08:54 I take pictures of my dog and pictures of my cat and pictures of fine bone China.
00:09:02 It's really quite nice.
00:09:05 Follow instagram.com slash hypocrite for all your fine bone China needs.
00:09:11 I actually have an image of a fine bone China teacup that I drank tea out of at a wedding.
00:09:18 So people are just wild for that fine bone.
00:09:23 I'm scrolling down to find it.
00:09:26 Where?
00:09:27 Are you allowed to display images of fine bone China in China?
00:09:34 Not because of the China thing, but because you're not allowed, you know how you're not
00:09:37 allowed to show skeletons, like showing skeletons as considered in a pro, yeah, in China, like
00:09:43 they had to, like they changed the, they changed the models in World of Warcraft of the, of the
00:09:49 undead because like every skeleton boss had to be turned into like a weird zombie guy.
00:09:55 Yeah.
00:09:56 Because it's like, why?
00:09:58 Because I don't know something about something about skeletons is like considered.
00:10:01 I would not want to go to the doctor in China if they've never seen a skeleton.
00:10:05 They don't understand.
00:10:06 Well, I mean, you go to the doctor and you show him your dick.
00:10:08 That's not appropriate in polite society either.
00:10:12 That's a fine bone China for you.
00:10:16 There we go.
00:10:17 Finally, someone did it.
00:10:19 It's like, wait a minute, wait a minute guys.
00:10:21 If it's, if it's, if, if vaginas are so inappropriate, how does anyone give birth in a hospital?
00:10:28 No one can look at a vagina.
00:10:31 You know, I was watching the Handmaid's Tale recently and they just do a thing where like,
00:10:35 they set up like a barrier where like the, the handmaids are like behind this wall and like,
00:10:40 like the doctor can see the vagina but not the woman who it's attached to.
00:10:44 So like they separate it out and it's not, it's like morally pure.
00:10:47 That's the, that's the, that's the both worlds.
00:10:49 If you know what I'm saying, that's the, that's the idea.
00:10:53 Talk about getting the milk for free.
00:10:56 Yeah.
00:10:57 Am I right, man?
00:10:58 Am I right?
00:10:59 Internet high five.
00:11:00 Yeah.
00:11:01 There it is.
00:11:02 There it is.
00:11:03 Yes.
00:11:04 Um, well enough about Instagram.
00:11:06 Uh, let's talk about a problem I'm having right now.
00:11:09 Okay.
00:11:10 All right.
00:11:11 What?
00:11:12 No, no, you go.
00:11:13 No, you go.
00:11:14 It's not, it's not like I just completed a, it's not like I just completed a, a massive
00:11:18 gauntlet and a milestone achievement.
00:11:20 Let's talk about that actually.
00:11:21 No, that's good.
00:11:22 Yeah.
00:11:23 Yeah.
00:11:24 So I went, I went the entire, uh, so last episode I mentioned that I had started fasting.
00:11:28 I went an entire week without eating.
00:11:30 Holy shit.
00:11:31 Yeah.
00:11:32 I went starting last PCP episode recording day.
00:11:34 It was, it was the day before that.
00:11:36 Okay.
00:11:37 So yesterday I started eating again and, uh, it didn't even feel like anything.
00:11:42 Like Ben, let's just hang on.
00:11:44 Ben just went for seven days without consuming food.
00:11:48 Oh, okay.
00:11:49 Okay.
00:11:50 Okay.
00:11:51 That's what happened.
00:11:52 Disclaimer.
00:11:53 Disclaimer.
00:11:54 I want to do this.
00:11:55 Okay.
00:11:56 Disclaimer.
00:11:57 I may, you may say I cheated because I did put lemon in my tea and water.
00:11:58 No.
00:11:59 So I may have consumed.
00:12:00 So I may have consumed up to maybe, maybe, maybe 30 calories or something.
00:12:05 Or maybe 50 calories tops over the entire week.
00:12:08 If your water has, if your water has any atoms of like anything that isn't water, any particulates
00:12:13 you failed.
00:12:14 Yeah.
00:12:15 Yeah.
00:12:16 Do not drink anything homeopathic because it has like, it has the spirit echoes of food
00:12:20 in it, of things that have calories in it and it actually magnifies the caloric content.
00:12:26 Having less of those things in them.
00:12:28 Ben, please tell us the impetus for this and your experience of doing so because it's
00:12:33 quite interesting.
00:12:34 Okay.
00:12:35 Also, how do you feel right now?
00:12:36 I mean, well, you're eating again now.
00:12:38 What have you eaten since then?
00:12:39 Since, since ending your fast?
00:12:40 I mean, I ate a bunch today.
00:12:42 No, not today.
00:12:43 I haven't eaten today.
00:12:44 But yesterday, I just ate, you know, I'm staying keto.
00:12:47 So yesterday I ate pork rinds.
00:12:50 I drank heavy cream.
00:12:52 I ate some leftover pork that was in the fridge.
00:12:56 I ate a bunch of natural peanut butter and celery, you know, just a bunch of keto shit.
00:13:02 Like a normal date.
00:13:03 People warned me that I should ease back into it.
00:13:06 I totally disregarded that advice and threw caution to the wind and it made no difference
00:13:11 and was fine.
00:13:12 Okay.
00:13:13 So Ben, what you're telling me is that all our viewers should, without consulting their
00:13:17 doctor and with wild abandon, stop consuming food, just add infinites.
00:13:23 That's right.
00:13:24 That would be best for that.
00:13:25 That's right, best guy ever.
00:13:27 I mean, I'm Ben St.
00:13:28 Professional Jerry Manderer and professional, non-professional medical advice giver.
00:13:33 And I'm here to tell you that you definitely shouldn't eat anymore.
00:13:37 Look, we talked about being post food.
00:13:39 I've lived it.
00:13:40 I've been to the other side and I've returned and I can tell you, it's really weird.
00:13:47 Around day three, like, okay.
00:13:49 It's hard to imagine doing it.
00:13:50 Okay, okay, okay.
00:13:51 Like day one and two, you know, I was a little hungry.
00:13:54 I was kind of, I was, on day two, I was hungry.
00:13:57 Day three, I was kind of hungry.
00:14:00 And then day four and after, I like, wasn't hungry at all.
00:14:03 I got a little weak, right?
00:14:05 Like I had, I had, there were sometimes where I felt a little fatigued and sometimes I might
00:14:09 get a little bit dizzy, not like to the point that I was going to faint or anything, but
00:14:12 I would kind of be like, you know, but it would, it would, it would pass.
00:14:18 It would pass.
00:14:19 And most doesn't sound great.
00:14:21 That doesn't sound like a great thing to have happen.
00:14:23 No, it wasn't.
00:14:24 It wasn't great.
00:14:25 But 90, 95% of the time, I just felt normal and not hungry and fine.
00:14:31 All right, Ben, do you think that part of the reason you felt okay was because you sit
00:14:37 at the computer drawing and or not drawing?
00:14:40 Yeah, I was going to ask.
00:14:41 And not like moving around that much?
00:14:44 Yes.
00:14:45 I do think that that helped.
00:14:46 I think if I had been like walking around, moving around, you know, lifting crates or
00:14:52 you know, tilling the soil, probably it would not have been as easy.
00:14:57 I feel like this is a thing that people in like history have done.
00:15:02 Like because they need to, you know, people survive because there's no food.
00:15:07 Yeah.
00:15:08 Their body adapts to the lack of food, but they can't go forever without food.
00:15:12 They need it eventually, but they can have like a, like a, a small thing of rice can
00:15:16 keep them going for a week or a month.
00:15:18 For a year.
00:15:19 Like the last day, like, I mean, I walked, you know, I walked like, you know, down the
00:15:23 street to the corner store and back and stuff.
00:15:26 And like I didn't, it wasn't that, you know, it was fine.
00:15:30 Yeah, I probably, if I'd been doing like manual labor or something, it probably would have
00:15:34 been more difficult.
00:15:35 But the reason I did it, you asked before, I mean, because I'm doing the keto thing,
00:15:41 people in the keto, in keto circles talk about fasting a bunch, usually in the context of
00:15:46 intermittent fasting.
00:15:47 But sometimes, you know, I listened to this, I listened to this podcast, well, actually
00:15:51 I haven't listened to it in a while because it got really old and samey.
00:15:54 And I was like, all right, guys, I get it.
00:15:56 There's this podcast called two keto dudes for a while.
00:15:58 I was listening to it and they're like really fat guys.
00:16:01 You know, they're like, you know, they were morbidly obese dudes, maybe still, I don't
00:16:05 know.
00:16:06 And you know, they, they talked about doing like extended fasts like for several days
00:16:09 and stuff.
00:16:10 And I just thought it was interesting.
00:16:11 I was like, well, all right, I want to try it.
00:16:13 And then, yeah, so I started doing it and then, but after a certain point, I was like,
00:16:18 I was like, okay, I know this is not a sustainable thing, although maybe it is.
00:16:23 But I was like, I just wanted to see if I could go for a week just to say I did it and I did
00:16:27 and now I'm a hero.
00:16:29 And yeah, there was a guy who did it for an entire year.
00:16:35 He was a more, there was a morbidly obese guy who, yeah, he fasted for 382 days.
00:16:42 He lost like 300 pounds.
00:16:46 The weight, he's, the weight stayed off.
00:16:48 See, I feel like obviously he was drinking water and he was taking like multivitamin supplements
00:16:54 and like salt supplements and potassium and stuff, but he was taking minerals and stuff
00:16:58 so he wouldn't die.
00:16:59 But he did not consume calories for over a year.
00:17:02 A bad act.
00:17:03 And his body, his body just consumed the energy and the fat.
00:17:06 He was carrying around a year's worth of food.
00:17:09 Yeah.
00:17:10 Yeah.
00:17:11 That's exactly the reason he was able to do it.
00:17:13 Yeah.
00:17:14 I don't think so.
00:17:15 No, no, no.
00:17:16 Of course not.
00:17:17 But like that's like fucking nuts.
00:17:18 Man, I feel like this man became like a plant, you know?
00:17:21 He became like a full synthesizing individual.
00:17:24 How many weeks of fat am I carrying around right now?
00:17:27 I want to do the calculations.
00:17:29 I bet I'm carrying around, I bet I'm carrying around at least a month, at least a month or
00:17:37 two.
00:17:38 God.
00:17:39 How disgusting.
00:17:40 I mean, I, all right.
00:17:42 Maybe, yeah, probably more than that actually.
00:17:44 People get too hung up about having any fat on their body.
00:17:48 People forget the point of fat is that exact reason.
00:17:51 To make you uglier.
00:17:52 To have...
00:17:53 Yeah, talk about Tom's right.
00:17:54 To have fuel on your person.
00:17:56 Right.
00:17:57 You don't need that much in day-to-day life.
00:17:59 The point of fat is God's punishment for decadence.
00:18:01 No.
00:18:02 For our decadent body.
00:18:04 I agree completely.
00:18:06 I hate it.
00:18:07 Which is why it's celebrated in some circles because they're celebrating decadence, which
00:18:11 makes sense.
00:18:12 It's not about being a big bloated boy, it's about having something on your person so
00:18:18 that you don't have to carry a satchel full of granola bars.
00:18:21 Give, give.
00:18:22 I'm hearing a lot of fat envy going on right now from skinny lads such as yourself.
00:18:26 I don't want to be fat.
00:18:28 The position of privilege you speak from.
00:18:30 I've never been fat.
00:18:31 I couldn't ever even become fat, it's impossible.
00:18:33 Exactly.
00:18:34 Fuck you.
00:18:35 Ha ha.
00:18:36 I'll bet we could make it happen.
00:18:39 Begin training montage.
00:18:42 Like a rocky style training montage of Ben coaching Hippo to get fat.
00:18:47 It's like Hippo's doing pull-ups and the camera pans over to me shaking my head like
00:18:53 mmm, mmm, mmm.
00:18:54 And then he's like sorry.
00:18:55 No, no.
00:18:56 We see Gib consuming massive amounts of food in this montage and everything looks good,
00:19:00 but then at the end the music turns to a sour note and then Ben looks down at heart.
00:19:05 It's like oh no, that's not milk you've been drinking, it's heavy cream and everyone's
00:19:09 got keto labels all over it.
00:19:11 He's been losing calories.
00:19:12 Like, like there's no tomorrow, he's become the most fit man.
00:19:15 This is the opposite of what we wanted.
00:19:17 No, no, no, you should drink, you should drink the heavy cream.
00:19:20 You should drink, you should eat, okay what's that stuff that the fucking sumo wrestler's
00:19:25 eat?
00:19:26 I've always wanted to try it.
00:19:27 I love the food.
00:19:28 Chicken nuggets.
00:19:29 There's some.
00:19:30 Yeah, that's right.
00:19:32 Have you guys had buttermilk before?
00:19:35 No.
00:19:36 You're not supposed to just drink it though, right?
00:19:39 The thing is, in Lithuania there's a type of buttermilk that is quite drinkable what
00:19:46 not.
00:19:47 It's a common drink, but it's different from the buttermilk I found in England though.
00:19:52 Is it called kefir?
00:19:54 Yes.
00:19:55 Okay, okay, okay.
00:19:56 When I was in Poland, like when I first got to Poland or close to it, I went to the supermarket.
00:20:03 It was called Biedronka, which means ladybug.
00:20:06 So I went down to my local Biedronka and I was walking around and I couldn't read any
00:20:12 labels on anything.
00:20:13 And I bought what I thought was milk and I drank, I thought it was like peach flavored
00:20:19 milk or strawberry flavored, you know, they have like weird or melon flavor, they have
00:20:23 weird flavors over there.
00:20:24 And I bought it and I drank it.
00:20:26 It was actually kefir, which was very unpleasant because kefir is like a thick buttermilk like
00:20:33 yogurt kind of thing.
00:20:35 So I drank this thinking that it was milk and I was like, oh god.
00:20:40 And then continued.
00:20:42 For you, for losing weight I think, or at least like it's a better alternative to milk.
00:20:47 Is it keto?
00:20:48 Was that Ben's first experience?
00:20:49 Probably keto.
00:20:50 I don't think it's keto because it's like, I mean yogurt's not keto.
00:20:55 Yeah, I guess so.
00:20:57 It's got lactose.
00:20:58 Well, Ben, I've relinquished my title to you as long as fasting person in the PCP.
00:21:06 So I've gone three days and you've surpassed me.
00:21:09 Yeah.
00:21:10 Good job, you did it.
00:21:12 Thank you.
00:21:13 It was total five days or seven days.
00:21:16 In some degree or another, going into the post food lifestyle, which is good to say.
00:21:19 It was seven whole days.
00:21:21 Seven full 24 hour periods.
00:21:24 Wow, that's loud.
00:21:26 I woke up on Saturday and I didn't even want to eat.
00:21:31 I wasn't like, oh finally.
00:21:33 Okay, during the week I had been, occasionally I would be like, I missed food emotionally
00:21:41 much more than I was like.
00:21:43 Exactly.
00:21:44 It is absolutely a mental battle.
00:21:46 Your body doesn't give a shit.
00:21:48 Yeah, yeah, my body was pretty much fine.
00:21:50 But I would be like, man, I wish I had a sausage right now.
00:21:53 I don't have Italian sausage.
00:21:54 I was thinking about salt.
00:21:55 All gay.
00:21:56 I know.
00:21:57 It turned me real gay.
00:21:58 That's just like every day just magnified.
00:22:00 But 99% of the time we don't need food.
00:22:03 Yeah, pretty much.
00:22:04 Our minds that want it.
00:22:06 But I woke up on Saturday and I was like, I don't even want to eat.
00:22:12 I bought this bag of pork rinds, or keto, and I looked at them and I was like, I said
00:22:19 I was going to eat them today so I guess I'll eat today.
00:22:22 And I did.
00:22:23 And I was like, all right.
00:22:25 The deed is done.
00:22:27 I think that was wise.
00:22:28 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:29 I didn't want to make this permanent.
00:22:33 Fasting definitely is like an enlightening experience.
00:22:35 You definitely transcend to a higher level of existence.
00:22:38 I feel a little bit differently about food in general now.
00:22:43 It's become optional.
00:22:45 What is the religion that fasts for a heck of a long time?
00:22:49 Ramadan?
00:22:50 Well, there's Ramadan.
00:22:51 Ramadan, I guess.
00:22:52 Or is that just one day?
00:22:53 I'm trying to think.
00:22:54 You can only eat when the sun's down or something in very small amounts.
00:22:57 Yeah, yeah.
00:22:58 Ramadan is intermittent fasting.
00:22:59 Yeah, right.
00:23:00 You know, actually that interests.
00:23:02 Let me tell a story.
00:23:03 I was like maybe three or four, I was maybe three or four days into the fast and my room
00:23:08 or my housemates invited me out to a party.
00:23:11 So I went out and, you know, it was just a small little gathering.
00:23:16 And, you know, there were snacks and, you know, I was offered snacks and I, you know,
00:23:21 I declined them and I explained like, you know, I'm fasting.
00:23:23 I'm not going to eat anything.
00:23:25 And I got, you know, for the most part that was fine.
00:23:29 A couple, there was, there were a couple of like very negative reactions that that got.
00:23:34 And.
00:23:35 Ah, yep.
00:23:36 Yeah.
00:23:37 Those people, I know them well.
00:23:38 Okay.
00:23:39 Well, there were two people that reacted negatively and they both.
00:23:42 All right.
00:23:43 I'm going to give like a complete, here I'm going to break down the complete psychological
00:23:47 makeup of two complete strangers who I know nothing about.
00:23:50 And I'm just going to assume that I'm completely right and you're all going to think I'm really
00:23:53 smart because nobody can dispute me.
00:23:55 All right.
00:23:56 So the first one, right, was a girl and I, and I say that I'm fasting and she says,
00:24:02 and I had a, I had a monster ultra, right?
00:24:05 The zero calorie, because I was drinking like zero calorie drinks because that's that.
00:24:08 I didn't think that counted.
00:24:09 Sure.
00:24:10 Sure.
00:24:11 And she's like, you're fasting.
00:24:12 Oh, but, you know, you, you know, you're, but you're drinking a monster.
00:24:14 And I'm like, oh, well, it's no, no, no calorie kind.
00:24:16 And she's like, oh, but, you know, it's still, she seemed kind of like miffed about it.
00:24:21 And, you know, based on, here I'm going to be a big racist right now.
00:24:25 Big fucking racist.
00:24:26 Just based on, just based on her complexion and on the fact that she seemed sort of a
00:24:31 little bit like insulted, like you seem like an, from an emotional place.
00:24:35 She seemed a little insulted by suggestion that I was fasting while drinking a monster.
00:24:39 I think that she might have been either, you know, Muslim or maybe just raised in a Muslim
00:24:44 household or have some like cultural and maybe she thought that it was like an, it was like
00:24:48 an insult to the idea of fasting that I was saying I was fasting while drinking this,
00:24:53 this decadent Western chemical swill.
00:24:56 I think that's a possibility.
00:24:58 And then later on, another girl, she was like, um, she was like, uh, you're fasting.
00:25:05 Oh, like, you're, she kind of got mad.
00:25:08 She was like, you're, you're fasting.
00:25:09 I was like, yeah, yeah, you know, oh, I'm keto.
00:25:12 Haha.
00:25:13 Yeah.
00:25:14 Notice how this was both women.
00:25:15 How interesting.
00:25:16 It was, it was two women.
00:25:17 And she's like, and I say that I'm fasting.
00:25:18 I'm cute.
00:25:19 And she's like, you're not in ketosis.
00:25:20 You're in starvation mode.
00:25:21 Your body's eating itself.
00:25:22 And I'm like, well, first of all, you're wrong because those two things aren't mutually exclusive
00:25:26 and you can totally be in ketosis while you're starving.
00:25:29 Like, of course you will be.
00:25:31 Um, and, and she, and she was like, oh, I don't believe in that diet.
00:25:35 I don't believe in that diet.
00:25:36 So, so this person, right?
00:25:37 This person, she was, she was, she was kind of husky.
00:25:40 I wouldn't say she was obese or anything, but she was husky.
00:25:43 She looked, she had the look about her.
00:25:45 She looked like she was on, uh, like women's rugby or a college softball team.
00:25:51 You know?
00:25:52 Okay.
00:25:53 Right?
00:25:54 A large lab.
00:25:55 Well, no, no.
00:25:56 I mean, you just know, like there's a certain, there's a certain kind of look.
00:25:58 Like, you know, like women's softball teams.
00:26:02 Interface or in her like body build?
00:26:04 Both.
00:26:05 Okay.
00:26:06 Sure.
00:26:07 Yeah.
00:26:08 And I think that this person was probably, this person probably had a certain amount
00:26:12 of athletic training, a certain amount of like knowledge about like exercise and diet
00:26:17 imparted to her by, you know, coaches and stuff that was probably in line with the,
00:26:22 um, you know, with the, with the more conventional wisdom of like a relatively high carb diet
00:26:28 and lifestyle for, you know, for, for peak athletic performance.
00:26:31 Yeah.
00:26:32 And this person was probably invested in that idea and had.
00:26:35 Whereas Ben's going for peak intellectual performance.
00:26:37 That's right.
00:26:38 And this person, and this person was probably invested in that idea and had spent a lot
00:26:41 of her, her life, you know, you know, working under that paradigm and was probably sort
00:26:45 of insulted or sort of, sort of subconsciously insulted by, by the, you know, by the presence
00:26:51 of someone who was going about like a completely different strategy and, and she's like, you
00:26:57 know, she had some, I think she had some emotional stake in this, in the idea that Keto, that
00:27:02 Keto is just a fad and it's dumb and like her way is the way to do things.
00:27:06 So there we go.
00:27:07 I broke it down.
00:27:08 That's pretty common, I'd say.
00:27:09 I broke, I broke down the two people that, that gave me, I mean, neither of them gave
00:27:12 me like a huge resistance, but I could tell, like I could tell in both of these people,
00:27:15 there was like a noticeable like things like fasting, Keto, imagine being the kind of person
00:27:23 and I like, I get why I'm not saying these people are crazy or anything, but to, to like,
00:27:27 when someone says, Hey, I'm doing this, this is the lifestyle that I'm choosing to live,
00:27:31 to like, begin to berate them in any kind of way, like, I get it.
00:27:36 If she, she probably really has, believes that she has some degree of expertise here.
00:27:40 Yeah.
00:27:41 You know, if she is an athlete and whatnot, and she sees you in her eyes, making a mistake
00:27:45 and also like propagating a belief system or whatever that she feels is wrong, I get
00:27:50 it.
00:27:51 Yeah.
00:27:52 You know, relax.
00:27:53 Yeah.
00:27:54 Well, I feel like if I was in a situation where somebody told me about a lifestyle that
00:27:58 I didn't agree with, I would mention it, but I wouldn't get angry, I guess.
00:28:02 I'd just be like, well, yeah, it's your body, it's your life, whatever.
00:28:05 Yeah.
00:28:06 I might be a bit passive aggressive.
00:28:08 I mean, I mean, yeah, it sounds like a proper discussion is, you know, a normal thing to
00:28:13 do, but you shouldn't get angry about it or like, don't get aggressive.
00:28:17 No, you should.
00:28:18 You should punch them.
00:28:19 Don't get aggressive because people will get defensive and you'll get nowhere.
00:28:22 Like, you're not going to get listened to if you just come off really strong, like, no
00:28:26 one's going to want to listen to a stranger that's yelling at them to do something different.
00:28:31 That's like the opposite.
00:28:32 Yeah.
00:28:33 Of what you want to do.
00:28:34 Yeah.
00:28:35 Yeah.
00:28:36 By the way, I had, I had a question for Ben.
00:28:39 Did you shit all of the shit out of you and then there was no shit left?
00:28:44 Yes, actually, I mean, all right, I'll, I'll go, I'll go into it.
00:28:50 Yeah.
00:28:51 I basically did not poop for like three days.
00:28:55 I finally did a little bit on like the fifth or sixth day and it was very small, you know,
00:29:01 as you would expect.
00:29:02 Of course.
00:29:03 The guy who fasted for a year, he would, he would go like 30 or 40 days between poop,
00:29:10 but he did, but he would, but he would, yeah, but he would poop occasionally, which is the
00:29:15 most surprising thing.
00:29:16 Well, because your body, I guess you still poop isn't just food.
00:29:18 It's dead cells and, you know, stuff from your body.
00:29:21 So, you know, and then, and then I don't know if it was a coincidence, but after I, but
00:29:25 after I finally ate like, wait, I did, I did poop again.
00:29:28 I don't know if it was like, I don't know if it was because I ate or if it just happened
00:29:32 to coincide.
00:29:33 Um, I will say that it made my poop and farts.
00:29:37 Uh, guy, this is really funny.
00:29:39 Uh, I love it.
00:29:42 It made them smell weird.
00:29:44 Like they, did it?
00:29:45 Yeah.
00:29:46 Like they smelled less like poop and more like, I don't know, they have like a weird musty
00:29:51 smell.
00:29:52 Victory.
00:29:53 Yeah.
00:29:54 Right.
00:29:55 So, I don't, so that's a little, that's, that's some, some TMI for y'all.
00:29:59 I'm inspired, Ben.
00:30:00 I want, I want to go eight days.
00:30:01 I want to top this Saturday.
00:30:03 God damn it.
00:30:04 Christ.
00:30:05 Let's not start another fasting arm race.
00:30:06 A fasting arm, arms, race, arms, race, arms, race, arms.
00:30:09 By the way, the PCP does not encourage you to do any of this shit.
00:30:13 No, no, no.
00:30:14 Without talking to your doctor.
00:30:15 Yeah.
00:30:16 Please.
00:30:17 No, but Ben St. does.
00:30:18 Um, and there you go.
00:30:19 And that's, and that's, no, that's the next PCP race.
00:30:21 It's the, uh, it's the PCP fasting arm race.
00:30:24 The PCP race to the grave.
00:30:26 Here we go, everybody.
00:30:28 It's doing great.
00:30:29 First one to get there with.
00:30:30 I mean, you don't have, I mean, there's faster ways than fasting.
00:30:34 If you know what I'm saying.
00:30:35 I hear you.
00:30:36 I hear you.
00:30:37 Fasting, despite the name, is actually quite slow.
00:30:39 Yeah.
00:30:40 Hmm.
00:30:41 Ironic.
00:30:42 Well, that was a fascinating topic.
00:30:44 Uh, let me, let me mention mine that was so rudely displaced by this whole diversion.
00:30:49 It was you.
00:30:50 You said you talked about it.
00:30:51 You hear this?
00:30:53 That's my ice rattled around in my cup of iced tea.
00:30:56 And when I sip, it hits my teeth and it's cold.
00:31:01 This is my problem.
00:31:02 I don't want to use a straw.
00:31:03 I don't want to use a straw like a pussy.
00:31:06 And I love lots of ice in my big old cup of tea.
00:31:09 And when I drink it, it gets too cold on my lips because the ice is touching it.
00:31:13 What's wrong with the straw?
00:31:16 I don't get it.
00:31:17 Why can't you just get like a manly straw?
00:31:21 There were plenty of straws around me, but I don't like them.
00:31:24 I like to pick up my glass like a man and tilt it like I'm swilling some grog and what
00:31:29 up.
00:31:30 All right.
00:31:31 All right.
00:31:32 All right.
00:31:33 All right.
00:31:34 All right.
00:31:35 Who cares about straws?
00:31:36 Why is it hitting your teeth?
00:31:37 Are your lips not there?
00:31:38 It actually hits my lips.
00:31:39 That's what I meant to say.
00:31:40 It's not hitting my teeth.
00:31:41 Yeah.
00:31:42 That was strange.
00:31:43 Yeah, I guess.
00:31:44 I suck it through my teeth like this.
00:31:47 I mean, I have a similar, I understand the problem.
00:31:51 I guess I just don't have as big of a deal with it.
00:31:53 I just use a straw.
00:31:54 It's been like the biggest problem in life.
00:31:57 Like I curve my lip, my top lip like inwards so that the more sensitive part is like sort
00:32:03 of hidden from the ice cold.
00:32:05 But then you get like the liquid on the top of your lip and it's, you can, you can try
00:32:09 something.
00:32:10 Then you just sniff it up.
00:32:11 You can try something.
00:32:12 You just sniff it right up.
00:32:13 Sipping.
00:32:14 I got nothing else, guys.
00:32:16 This was, I feel passionate about this.
00:32:18 I have a talk.
00:32:19 This is the most asinine problem I've ever heard in my life.
00:32:22 But wait, what's, what is, the problem is that the cold ice makes your teeth cold?
00:32:27 Yes.
00:32:28 No, it makes my lip cold.
00:32:29 It hits his teeth.
00:32:30 What the fuck?
00:32:31 That's my problem.
00:32:32 Yes.
00:32:33 This is my biggest problem.
00:32:34 Talk about it.
00:32:35 You know, in China, I don't even have ice nates.
00:32:38 They don't even have lips.
00:32:40 I have a topic though.
00:32:42 Okay, sure.
00:32:43 I mentioned it earlier.
00:32:44 I was, I was on a trip on a guided tour with my mom and it was amazing because I don't
00:32:49 actually go outside of my house that much.
00:32:52 Wait, where was the tour?
00:32:53 Yeah, where was it?
00:32:54 It was in a different part of Lithuania.
00:32:56 It wasn't in one specific town, but it was near a beach town called Konus and that was
00:33:01 the end destination, basically.
00:33:04 And Konus.
00:33:05 Konus.
00:33:06 I think the proper, technically proper pronunciation is Kaunus, but most people just call it Konus
00:33:13 now.
00:33:14 Okay.
00:33:15 It comes from the words to fight, sort of, kind of.
00:33:19 Oh, is this the battlefield of the violence?
00:33:22 No, no, no, no.
00:33:24 It's not my town.
00:33:25 It's not my town.
00:33:26 Um, so yeah, like, I just assume all of Lithuania is just your home town, the entire thing.
00:33:33 We talked about Konus before, like, I'm, look, this sounds really familiar.
00:33:37 I don't.
00:33:38 Is that where the tower is?
00:33:41 Is that where, like, the, remember the tower from, uh, from the flag, from the flag episode?
00:33:47 God damn.
00:33:48 My brain has all the, remember?
00:33:50 When they make it a flag, there's like a tower?
00:33:52 No, Ben, no one remembers this.
00:33:54 So let's move on.
00:33:55 No, I'm having a panic attack.
00:33:57 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I just remembered.
00:33:59 No, it's from Vidinus, I believe, a Gidman-esque tower.
00:34:03 No, no, this, uh, Konus has its own castle, and I forgot how it's called, god damn it.
00:34:08 Anywho, um, but yeah, the point is...
00:34:11 Bowser's castle.
00:34:12 We visited a few castles and stuff.
00:34:16 And, uh, did someone join?
00:34:19 Yes, but it's a secret. Oh, okay. It's a secret. I worry about it. Sorry. We have a secret ghost
00:34:26 That spoke me and threw me off. Okay, but anyway, any who so yeah
00:34:30 We went to visit castles and what's and then and then the ghost
00:34:35 The death the death of the ghost, okay
00:34:37 so like well
00:34:38 What surprised me is because I was sort of under the impression that most if not all of the castles were completely destroyed in the second
00:34:44 war in Lepinia and
00:34:47 Like both me and mom we're quite
00:34:49 Ah get fucked retards
00:34:52 So both me and mom were surprised was like castles as in plural like we're gonna see more than one
00:34:59 The one in the in the capital. So yeah, it was a pretty fun trip. We had no clue where we were going technically
00:35:05 I mean, we knew the final destination was gonna be Kona's
00:35:08 But yeah, we haven't seen or heard about these places before so it was gonna be pretty interesting
00:35:13 and we learned about a bit of history and stuff and I took a lot of pictures and
00:35:17 I I took a lot of pictures of nature and stuff
00:35:21 But you can see all these pictures
00:35:25 Instagram.com slash legal or me. Yeah, I was I was surprised about how
00:35:31 like
00:35:32 Like two of the three castles that we saw
00:35:36 They're like they were completely ruined. They were like just just like
00:35:40 In complete ruins up until like people started restoring them and even now they're kind of like a little bit shitty
00:35:47 But I guess that's like, you know, the authenticity
00:35:49 We I've had shown bricks that were like over 600 years old and I remember like the thing that I could show you some dirt
00:35:57 That's over 600 years old
00:35:59 Listen like the bricks are held together by some sort of mass and I remember one one of the
00:36:06 Things they used to create that mass was like eggs
00:36:08 And it was like holy shit, and it's still keeping the bricks together
00:36:12 And there was like egg in it and egg yolk or something like that. Did you get to eat some? No
00:36:20 Those bricks are keto. It's like it's like the fight like the final the final stop on the tour is you stop at the mess hall
00:36:26 And you get a free brick
00:36:29 Everyone
00:36:31 It wasn't the brick it was the thing holding the bricks together. I forgot. Oh the more the mortar
00:36:36 I am guessing so that's that reminds me of a quote from the Bible that reminds me of a quote from the Bible
00:36:44 And
00:36:45 I found this I found this while I was making I was making the new map for endless war and I was looking for quotes to
00:36:51 to put in it's like flavor text for each of the different areas and
00:36:57 and
00:36:59 For I found this one, and it's from like it's from Genesis
00:37:02 I think it's from the part where they're building the Tower of Babel and you know the whole endless war slime thing the connections incredible
00:37:08 Beyblade the the tower you remember when Moses part of the Red Sea with Beyblade
00:37:16 Hell yeah, anyway, the point is when they're talking about the Tower of Babel
00:37:19 okay different versions translated differently, but
00:37:22 The King James verbal translated as come let us make brick and berm them thoroughly and they had and brick
00:37:28 They had for stone and slime they had for mortar and let us know about this
00:37:33 Yeah brick they had for stone and slime they had for more and they build us and we'll build us a city
00:37:37 Something something and a tower that reaches under the heavens, and it is so fucking appropriate. It was so great
00:37:44 Literally and speaking of towers
00:37:46 There were quite a few towers with the with the with the castles and like there was one mentioned
00:37:50 No, wait a state thing that we visited as well
00:37:53 It was pretty neat and like there were a lot of towers and I climbed every single tower
00:37:57 And then we also visited a few hills and I climbed every single hill. There were so many fucking stairs guys every single hill
00:38:04 There's a lot of
00:38:06 The ones we visited I meant
00:38:09 Okay, and like oh, it was it was so like my legs were literally shaking. They were literally shaking in their boots
00:38:15 They were like, please mage no more no more walking and it was like it's only 3 p.m
00:38:20 We still have a bit to go and we still walked and we still climbed and I was not
00:38:25 I've never left her house before ever ever since retiring the violent violence
00:38:31 monitor
00:38:32 Thrown back out into the cold uncaring world
00:38:35 Not physically prepared for the hardships that awaited the hills challenged every fiber of her being
00:38:43 And and I conquered every single challenge. It was great
00:38:46 I was I was I was I was very very tired, but I was very happy with myself like one of one of the hills
00:38:51 I'm not sure if it's impressive or not, but like it's just one of the things I climbed
00:38:55 It was like 30 feet high and
00:38:59 It's just one of the things I climbed and and there that was like
00:39:03 Like after climbing like two or so towers in one church
00:39:08 Tower and like another hill basically a lot of climbing a lot of stairs and those stairs weren't even comfortable guys like in the
00:39:15 Towers, they were like old rickety crackety like wooden stairs
00:39:19 I was so I'm really bad at climbing stairs because I have very bad balance. So I was gonna I was gonna fall
00:39:25 I was afraid I was gonna fall, but I never fell so that's good
00:39:29 Glad to hear it. Yep. You know, it's weird
00:39:32 That's all pretty dope. Just just as an aside
00:39:36 Castles are cool. I
00:39:37 Drive by on my way to the store like two or three castles or gigantic churches
00:39:44 Like on in the middle of Ohio in Cincinnati. I mean, yeah, there's more churches, obviously
00:39:50 But I swear to God. There's there's a company nearby
00:39:53 Okay, rather there is just a castle tower that's being built next to a bunch of houses with the sign next with it's just like
00:40:01 Custom-building, you know
00:40:03 Whatever Sanford and Sun's construction and they've got like pictures of castles
00:40:07 They just build castles out here for like people who want to live in a castle and I drive by like every day
00:40:14 Yeah, it's pretty dope. It's pretty dope
00:40:17 That's like sort of neat but imagine having to maintain a castle
00:40:22 If you have a castle, I'm assuming you're paying people to do the main I guess but I wouldn't trust people
00:40:27 Maybe you just maybe you're just like one of those like maybe you're like that girl. Maybe you're like the girl from
00:40:35 That's that fucking that fucking dragon anime
00:40:38 You just love being a maid and you just
00:40:42 And you want and you want to live in a and you want to live in a castle
00:40:46 Specifically because you want to have you to never be done cleaning
00:40:50 Wait, is that what does that true of Toru? Does she want to but she's a dragon, right?
00:40:55 Isn't isn't like her thing that she just loves being a maid and
00:41:02 Kobayashi because she saved her from dying also, she's a big lesbian
00:41:13 Okay bad example then maybe maybe just like maybe you're just naturally servile
00:41:17 And you want to live as a as an indentured servant to your home and to never
00:41:26 It's the situation we're like you've got those like
00:41:37 They're all color-coded and named individually yes. Yeah. Oh my god. I want this
00:41:41 I want so many you give them tiny little like night's pommels on the top
00:41:48 Like they have like like crests like helmet crests like nights
00:41:55 Just oh, yeah
00:41:57 No, they shouldn't hurt each other. No
00:42:02 You make them joust each other
00:42:05 Yeah, yeah, of course the the you have to mount the the lance is too high
00:42:10 So they just miss each other every time they just keep driving by over and over again
00:42:14 And and like and if any of them go out of line you like you you publicly execute
00:42:26 You have a gallows
00:42:28 That's good. You just like pull the power supply out and just watch them like slowly
00:42:32 No, no, no, don't make me sad I love Roomba. They're my boys
00:42:38 They're so good but speaking about it public execution and stuff like that back to the
00:42:43 Speaking of public execution, I have a topic that's near to my heart
00:42:50 Mange publicly executing all her enemies back. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no
00:42:54 I took a picture of like a tree that has like seven trunks technically speaking of speaking of public execution
00:43:00 Let me tell you about growing up in Lithuania
00:43:04 What about this tree relates to yeah, yeah, and like they were like it's not just a public execution
00:43:09 But it was rumored that people that went out of line were there's like this metal rod coming from the
00:43:15 Well in between the trunks of the tree and it said that people were strapped to it and like got like what's it called?
00:43:23 Like with the whip lashes. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, something that they were punished against this tree
00:43:29 As the rumor goes but the person who was talking about it's like always just a rumor but and like why is there a metal rod in between the
00:43:40 The trunks and why is it at a very convenient height for stuff like that to happen?
00:43:45 How long do you think that rod has been there? Oh a while. The tree is very big
00:43:52 Splits into hundreds and hundreds of years
00:43:55 A few hundred I'm guessing. Okay. Well, that's pretty dope
00:43:59 I like castles. Oh and
00:44:03 I like the castles too as in the same castles as well
00:44:06 Like one of the first things we saw was like this hole in the ground with a big chunky boy at the bottom
00:44:12 Like it wasn't an actual person. It was just like
00:44:15 Like this white mass that's meant to look like a human, but he's a very chunky boy a very obese boy
00:44:23 But it's meant to represent like a human and it was like
00:44:26 This was like the dungeon hole and it was like six feet
00:44:30 Not six feet six meter six meters in so that's like a lot of feet a lot more feet
00:44:37 Yeah, like 18-19 feet. Like 18 feet or something. Yeah, like you ever take
00:44:41 So without any sort of light or any sort of anything it was just a hole in the ground and the people who
00:44:49 disobeyed the owner of the castle were
00:44:53 You know put there and it was very damp very dark very
00:44:57 Lonely and like the only way to get out is if they dropped a rope from the ceiling and and and the god pulled out
00:45:04 And right I took a picture of that
00:45:06 I managed to take a picture of that hole because it was very hard because there were a lot of people in our guided tour
00:45:11 So a lot of people can photo bombing my photos. So
00:45:16 Disgusting
00:45:18 They're trying to get they're trying to get in with the PCP they're trying to yeah
00:45:22 They're trying to achieve that coveted status of being PCP adjacent
00:45:27 A lot of people were hurling themselves into that hole just to obstruct your picture of the contents of the hole
00:45:34 Know what mage it looks like and all of you dear PCP listeners do not
00:45:40 Think about it this way. They don't know I'm mage
00:45:42 So right but they know but they know in the back of it some deep reasons of their mind
00:45:47 They will always remember that they photo bombed you and it's like remember who it was the look of utter
00:45:53 Distain that was shot their way. These these people are all these people are all gonna go home, right with their with their nice little
00:45:59 They're nice little family. There's little family photos
00:46:02 To their into their homes to their homes with their white picket fence and their slime wives
00:46:07 These fucking juvie scum are gonna go home and look at their at their holiday pictures their photo album and they're gonna pull it up and
00:46:14 You know you're gonna have been in some of them, but when they look at the photos again, they're just they're just they're just gonna see like a purple blur
00:46:21 There's gonna there's not gonna be a bird a person there
00:46:23 They're like what what's gonna be like but but the picture wasn't black and white
00:46:29 They have an inventive color photography over there yet. Yeah
00:46:35 Like what is what what is this weird this weird cryptid this weird purple cryptid like?
00:46:41 No, nobody knows nobody knows
00:46:44 One tassel had like five legs around it
00:46:49 Is that a ghost rattling chains do you have chain mail? No, it is it is I the gatekeeper
00:46:57 These are my rot iron keys
00:47:01 I got I got a whole thing I
00:47:03 I'm saying this I'm doing this a new character new character with gatekeeper. He has keys and he rattles them around
00:47:09 I got this bunch of like actual like wrought iron keys on a on a on a circular like
00:47:16 Wrought iron thing like there isn't an opening. You can't take the keys off. It's just connected
00:47:21 Oh, and I got it at a castle gift shop in Leeds castle. No, that's that's if you want wrought iron keys
00:47:28 And they had a whole thing of actual chain mail. It was very expensive
00:47:31 Yeah, and I really wanted well my brother really wanted any cried all the way home cuz he didn't get chain
00:47:39 But um Leeds castle very cool place if you ever I mean I typed in like I was trying to think how many castles
00:47:46 I've been to and which ones they were and I typed in English castle into Google and there's so many oh
00:47:51 I've I've got such a wealth of choices. I think I've been to like 10
00:47:57 Give is I want us to do a rad con
00:48:00 In England come to you come to your pad and then like we just we just either if we have enough money rent a castle
00:48:06 And if not, we just have to shoot. Oh my god
00:48:09 All of our footage at a publicly available castle and make everyone think that we're having rad con in a castle
00:48:16 Not completely impossible. That sounds super sick, and I want to do it right now
00:48:21 Red rad con for a night is like Bodium castle is is one that's like the most stereotypical like castle that all like generic
00:48:32 Playsets were based off of it's a square
00:48:35 With four like circular, you know pillars and and it's like got a courtyard in the middle
00:48:40 And that's basically and it's got a moat and it's like you can go everywhere in that and you can go up to the
00:48:46 battlements and all the cool stuff and
00:48:49 That would be great
00:48:51 Shooting a fate like a YouTube show where people are looking at imagine imagine red con arena
00:48:57 Imagine like a the nerf battle in a castle. Oh, but but but a melee version with real swords
00:49:05 We get the go pros back out with so oh we got to do a melee we got to do a melee
00:49:13 Is there an English word specifically for hills that castles are built up on on
00:49:20 There is I can't remember at them there's a mock for the hills themselves
00:49:25 Yeah, because like the Latvian use is full of them, and I never realized up until like very recently
00:49:30 I guess I like for a while, but
00:49:33 It's called a mutt an m-o-t-t-e a mutt. It's like a an artificial hill used to
00:49:40 You know make a castle be bigger and yeah, okay
00:49:45 Those hills but not a lot of castles because those were all destroyed like yeah
00:49:50 See in like when I was little and people kept like mentioning those hills those moths and I just assumed
00:49:57 It's just another word for a hill and like up until recently just hit me
00:50:01 It's like we talked about a man-made one. Yeah
00:50:04 We used to have like a shit ton of castles that means because we have a shit ton of like moths
00:50:10 So wow it looks like I'm looking it up. It looks like it looks like a burial mound, but it's I guess it's not
00:50:15 I guess it's just a man-made hill. I think I think I think in America. Maybe certain like
00:50:21 Maybe I'm crazy. I feel like maybe certain like Native American tribes or someone had they built these very similar looking mounds as like burial mounds
00:50:29 I know
00:50:31 That's what it looks like to me. I
00:50:34 Don't think it's yeah history. Yeah. I mean, it's possible. Really. It's not really yeah
00:50:40 I've got an important other topic to talk about
00:50:43 And it's great. So it's Dr. Who release trailer that just came out
00:50:49 Have you guys I linked it in the in the chat. It's 30 seconds long. You should take a look
00:50:56 Yeah
00:50:59 What what I'm a busy guy. You think I got 30 seconds to waste on this bullshit. Fair enough, okay?
00:51:04 But I guess this is the funniest round to play. I got cookie clicker to play mother fucker. Yeah, you're right
00:51:09 You're right. This is the funniest thing I've ever seen though because in this trailer
00:51:13 The only things that happen are the camera zooms in on this on her
00:51:18 You know girl dr. Who obviously they pan up as she literally shatters the glass ceiling
00:51:25 Whoops, and she says it's about time
00:51:28 Are you fucking?
00:51:33 So what I was saying is it's time for a woman. I mean clearly
00:51:39 Why do you like that give to that seems really corny to me is my is my
00:51:42 All right, I don't know that really watch dr. Who a lot but I don't it is a very corny show
00:51:48 It has never not been a corny show. It's just that's fair
00:51:52 Oh, all right, the way I would describe it is that you know how one piece has a lot of goofy shit
00:51:57 But it's also the coolest thing ever. It's basically a corny show that occasionally becomes the most incredible
00:52:03 sci-fi badass thing with the characters that you love so much you cry when they die and they're dead and they're not coming back
00:52:10 Oh, it's that was one of those but let's not forget this character has done nothing to endear us to her yet
00:52:15 Obviously, I mean, but I don't know. I mean I can't remember whether they did another like
00:52:21 Hey get ready for Matt Smith or like ready for Peter Capaldi and he says
00:52:26 Here's catchphrase. I guess her catchphrase is whoops, which is adorable. I'm sorry
00:52:32 But by the way, Jesse was here commenting is that when I posted that and he's just
00:52:37 Well, hang on. I just said I just he said like imagine be the boy that gets to put his wiener in girl
00:52:42 Doctor who to which I replied is it gay thinking about her male history. She's and then
00:52:51 There's a debate we could have well
00:52:53 She had a male body and now is the same person in a female body
00:52:57 So, I mean, you know
00:52:59 Jesse just saying I hope the season is about confronting the philosophical conundrum of is it gay and I
00:53:05 Expect I expect at least a line of her going. Huh. I'm not used to this much estrogen
00:53:12 It just am I am I the only one the things she kind of looks like Hillary Clinton a little bit
00:53:18 I mean, I mean, it's her time. It is
00:53:23 This is the best we can do for she didn't get the presidency, but we can give her this
00:53:28 It's way better to become the doctor than to become the president
00:53:32 Kind of well, okay, maybe not you can time travel and me and not change the past and win the presidency
00:53:43 What if I just shit and what it what if what if in this season
00:53:48 Doctor who goes back in time and changes the 2016 presidential election and get Hillary Clinton
00:53:54 the like instead of Trump like what if what if that happened?
00:53:57 That's only a little far-fetched in my opinion
00:54:00 Can't we can't change the past I think they had one episode specifically with Rose going back in time and like changing like like trying to
00:54:07 Save her father from dying and what if they make the one exception for the
00:54:13 Racist evil hero
00:54:16 You know one thing we could only change one thing in history and I think this needs to be it
00:54:24 Rips a hole in space time
00:54:27 Oh, what do you have a problem with holes you fucking misogynist some of us have holes
00:54:31 You wouldn't understand what it's like. Eww, male splater. Come on. That's that's heinous. You're hang on has at least
00:54:38 You're not you're nasty. You guys are all nasty. Don't talk about holes here
00:54:43 I don't like the amount of holes we have
00:54:49 Seal them up. We got seal them up. Y'all are assholes. That's true. Hashtag seal the holes
00:54:56 All right
00:54:58 I just want to bring that up because that was very funny to me what cartoon it was but like oh
00:55:03 I think it was I am weasel and like the IR baboon or whatever. He tried to plug every single hole with plugs
00:55:12 Does that include like his mouth and shit? I don't remember but it
00:55:16 It was there was a very big hole and I am weasel. Yeah
00:55:20 Man, that was that was in my childhood. We're talking about holes in his body
00:55:24 No, no, no, no, like he was like a little hole in the ground and he was trying to plug that up
00:55:28 Oh, I thought you mean in that in that episode. I I think his hashtag plug him up
00:55:35 I think his trade was basically just selling plugs for holes
00:55:39 And I think he did plug I am weasel's mouth with with the plug but just just as like a joke with a
00:55:45 mouth plug
00:55:46 I I have a I have an anecdote for my real life
00:55:50 Right. Um when when the when the gatekeeper was rattling his uh his keys, right? It reminded me
00:55:55 It reminded me of what's going of what what I deal with what I deal with every
00:56:00 Yeah, yeah, it's like it was only yesterday
00:56:02 No
00:56:04 It's what I deal with in my real life, which is that my my housemates have a bunch of bizarre memes
00:56:09 Okay, I'm not the like we've all got like bizarre memes about each other
00:56:13 Sure. Um, so I won't go into everyone else's but I'll they'll talk about mine. Uh mine is um
00:56:19 Uh, they call me they call me thumper because um because apparently because I'm a I'm a lumbering
00:56:25 I'm a lumbering brood of a man
00:56:27 And uh, and when I walk around when I when I walk down the stairs or like walk across the living room
00:56:32 You know, I shake the ground because I have I'm a grace. I'm a graceless gorilla
00:56:37 And um, yeah, yeah as well, you know, uh, but they also call me. You just got that giant brain resting on their shoulders, you know
00:56:45 Yeah, and but but so first I was thumper, but then it evolved it evolved to
00:56:50 Rattle bambi. So now I am called rattle bambi
00:56:54 And
00:56:56 The joke is uh, that uh, you say rattle bambi
00:57:02 Rattle those chains
00:57:15 So that just the idea is that rattle rattle bambi
00:57:18 Jake lives upstairs in his like upstairs attic dungeon or whatever and he rattles his chain and he rattles his chains and eats fish heads
00:57:27 And that's that's rattle bambi and I am rattle bambi and that's that's keto
00:57:33 They are key. They are. Yeah. In fact, okay. All right. So I'm okay with it. Yeah
00:57:38 Rattle those chains
00:57:42 So I'm like, all right. All right gatekeeper. Can we get a rattle for for rattle bambi please?
00:57:47 Yeah, yeah
00:57:49 Hashtag rattle for rattle bambi. No hashtag rattle those chains. Oh, sorry. I wasn't paying attention, but the gatekeeper was
00:58:08 I should send you a picture though. Yeah, please do. Let's put a picture on it. That's a good idea
00:58:11 What are you taking the gates from though?
00:58:13 I would I keep the gates from
00:58:17 Well, any well any of the foreigners well any well any of those keys undo the giant padlock that I have my wrists thrust through
00:58:25 Perhaps no
00:58:27 The stocks that I'm that I'm in as I rattle my chains. These fake keys only open fake doors
00:58:38 Hey, so
00:58:41 This is maybe a dumb topic that I shouldn't even bring up because I I can't even talk about it
00:58:46 Um
00:58:47 Because I don't want to spoil it, but anyone see the the adventure time finale adventure time just finished
00:58:55 I have not seen it and I want to um
00:58:58 I had I had kind of thought
00:59:00 I had I had kind of thought that adventure time ended like a year ago, but I guess it didn't
00:59:05 Yeah, I guess not. They're like announced it was gonna end a year ago
00:59:09 Okay, I remember before before I moved in
00:59:12 Mage turn your fucking mic off. I'm sorry
00:59:16 Ignore
00:59:17 It was okay. Um, so so um
00:59:19 um
00:59:21 So two years ago when I before I moved into digi's place before rad con 2
00:59:26 I remember me and me and my friend, uh, we watched like
00:59:30 We watched what was then all the rest of adventure time
00:59:35 and uh, I remember at the time thinking that like adventure time
00:59:38 Was almost over like the next season was gonna be the last one
00:59:41 But I guess I was wrong because here we are two years later and it only now ended
00:59:45 Uh, someone in my discord the other day said that he thinks, um, he thinks we probably a lot of people thought it had ended
00:59:51 And that we probably are experiencing the mandela effect that in another universe adventure time did end
00:59:58 But we've been transferred to one word where it only just ended now
01:00:01 Um, so I'm so I guess I'm two years of note
01:00:05 So I guess I'm two years behind but I want to catch it up because I was a pretty big fan of it
01:00:09 I remember like back then when I when I when I caught up on it two years ago
01:00:14 I remember that like the general feeling was that adventure time was not what it had been and it had declined in quality
01:00:19 Since the early days, but I remember that time we watched like a dozen episodes and like
01:00:24 I had a great fucking time and we laughed like a shit ton like it was like those episodes were really funny
01:00:30 And I remember coming out of like, huh?
01:00:32 I just kind of assumed that it wasn't the show it used to be but like that was great and like I think it's still really strong
01:00:38 Um, so I wonder if that state I wonder if that held true through to the end
01:00:42 Maybe they've they found like a second wind, you know for the for the end a couple of seasons. I would hope so
01:00:48 Yeah, I didn't I didn't like I didn't like the um
01:00:53 I didn't love how much focus the whole like who's finn gonna end up dating got
01:00:59 I thought that I thought that most episodes focusing on that as a primary point of interest were the weakest ones
01:01:07 um
01:01:08 I I fell off the adventure. I stopped adventuring
01:01:13 In season four at some point. I think it was during or after
01:01:17 Some like spat with flame princess or something. Yeah, and I was just like
01:01:24 I can tell you exactly what episode I uh checked out permanently
01:01:29 From uh from adventure time and it was uh, let me see the 22nd episode in the fifth season
01:01:34 And I hadn't seen every episode but it's the episode the party's over
01:01:38 Isla de senorita
01:01:40 And it was the episode where they attempted to make a real character out of the party god and that's when I knew
01:01:45 Yeah, there was nothing left for me here, but that was bad. That was a bad idea
01:01:50 Because I've been so checked out from adventure time. I loved the pilot years and years before the show ever got serialized
01:01:57 I was the biggest fan when it first came out. Everyone else is a baby compared to me
01:02:01 Uh, but I uh over time like whatever I fell out of it because I was so disconnected
01:02:05 I felt completely safe the other day watching someone's like review slash summary of the final episode
01:02:12 And I gotta say it looked awesome and I want to watch that now, uh because I really liked it
01:02:19 I've been totally spoiled
01:02:21 I've only been I've I've I've received some slight spoilers for the finale
01:02:27 Nothing nothing too big. So um, they were gay the whole time. Yeah
01:02:32 Well, I mean that is that really a spoiler. That's the only thing I know about the finale personally
01:02:37 Right, that's the only thing that 99% of the fandom probably even cares about
01:02:45 Frankly, I don't want to spoil it
01:02:46 But like the message at the end is just exactly what I want to see from like this show
01:02:52 And I was just like when I saw them get to this in this little summary some lady did I was like
01:02:57 Hell yes. Hell. Yes. This is exactly what I want from the show
01:03:01 Adventure is good
01:03:03 What I want what I want is somebody to like put together a
01:03:08 What is important? What is an important episodes to watch of adventure?
01:03:11 I've already saw somebody putting together a tier list of like episodes you can skip to just watch the good adventure time
01:03:18 I want to finish it. I want to I want to wrap up things because yeah
01:03:21 I only vaguely understand that the lich exists. Oh, I kind of want to I kind of want to know
01:03:27 I kind of want to know a bit more about all that because it seems like a villain a lot happens with that guy. Yeah, yeah
01:03:34 Um, yeah, I mean, I think you're in luck
01:03:36 I think people are working on that at these at this very moment
01:03:39 I when I when I saw this finale thing it just filled me with all the happiness
01:03:44 Uh that I had when I first started watching the show
01:03:47 And man, it made me want to just like jump back in and feel those good vibes again
01:03:51 Because adventure time was really good when it was at its best. Yeah
01:03:55 Gets me all for all kinds of ways. Yeah
01:03:58 And it started is am I wrong that adventure time was like the first show that started this whole
01:04:03 Cal arts thing going on. Um
01:04:05 It was like the most intellectual cartoon of the last like forever. Yeah. Yeah, I think there may have been a show
01:04:13 Before but it wasn't as widely known. I guess it was just the biggest one
01:04:17 I think before people god hung up on the whole cal arts terminology people did
01:04:22 Call it like all the adventure time style. I at least I've seen it before
01:04:27 And now that's changed a little bit to the steven universe style
01:04:30 Especially when they love the gaze as they sure do in
01:04:33 the adventure time
01:04:35 I mean the the steven universe style like, um, I I don't want to rant about it for too long
01:04:40 But you know the cold crunch roll original series. Oh, hi guardian spice. Yeah. Yeah. Do we mention it last time?
01:04:46 Be like because the thing it does not look like
01:04:51 Cal arts, it doesn't look like steven universe so much as it looks like. Um, what's that little witch academia thing?
01:04:57 I mean, I would argue me a little witch academia. Yeah
01:05:01 Is that the little witch academia thing? I was I wasn't sure if that's the correct
01:05:06 Naper but hey kudos for me for actually remembering the full title. Wait. Yeah. No, hold on
01:05:13 Was it high garden spice?
01:05:17 This is really remind me of the main character from little witch academia. Dude, are they gonna have it? No, no, there's definitely
01:05:24 No, no, you're 100% wrong and that's that that's literally the dumbest opinion I've ever heard
01:05:30 The show definitely looks western like no one's gonna look at them like oh
01:05:36 A little like more detailed and more anime, right? They're adding a little bit more detail. Um, I don't know
01:05:42 It's funny. Me me and did you're just talking about this on iam games last night?
01:05:45 Uh, we're doing another stream as soon as this episode is done recording. So if uh, you've missed it
01:05:51 So if you can go back in time fair viewers
01:05:54 Six days. Yeah, so
01:05:56 Definitely watch the the upload that we'll have if you missed it you fucking peasants are playing spider-man on ps4 and it's great
01:06:02 Oh, you know what we're doing fable
01:06:05 No, we stopped doing fable because digi got bored and then we went to red dead red dead redemption
01:06:12 And then and then we were playing that and we both hated it thoroughly. So now we're doing spider-man. Yeah
01:06:17 I was like, I would love that. Yeah, that's why we stopped doing it because like if we make a video about this and just trash it
01:06:22 We're never gonna get anywhere. So we'll probably get a lot of views though. I mean if you have a contrary opinion
01:06:27 That's something right and if you sincerely believe it, you know
01:06:30 It was we're kind of at the point where we're trying to like build some good faith for us before we told you
01:06:35 Here's what you do. No, no, no, you make a video doesn't matter. What's in it and you call it the red dead redemption rant
01:06:40 That's all you do and then you get a thousand
01:06:43 And then afterwards after your mind has been changed you do the red dead redemption arc
01:06:47 Oh
01:06:51 Well, the thing is that we didn't want to play through an entire like game that we hated
01:06:55 So because we still have to do all the live streams. It's just like neither of us wanted to play it
01:07:00 um
01:07:01 But yeah, so now we were talking about high guardian spice because it was just like
01:07:05 Because digi obviously made that video that blew up and like because I wanted to be as big as you know and got a bunch of shit for it
01:07:10 uh, but like
01:07:12 I don't think I don't know if the show is going to be bad like that's the whole thing like everyone
01:07:16 Oh, yeah, like this show is going to be garbage
01:07:19 It's like if we if we there was a trailer like they put together for high guardian spice for steven universe
01:07:26 I would have thought the show was going to suck balls, right?
01:07:28 Like because it's it totally has the same kind of virtue signaling kind of like
01:07:33 All we know about it is that the conceit of the show is heavily virtue signaling
01:07:37 So like of course people are going to react like steven universe made it work like somehow
01:07:41 So like I think the aesthetics of the show are are nice like it's clearly not anime
01:07:46 Um, and I don't think this is the way crunchy rolls should be spending their money
01:07:50 See that's the biggest thing for me about this whole crunchy roll thing when I really sat down
01:07:53 I don't agree that like anything any criticisms of the show are valid yet
01:07:58 Uh of the show itself criticisms of the marketing and the advertising so far
01:08:02 I get but the main thing is that people pay crunchy roll to support anime and this is not anime. That's my main
01:08:08 That's my huge issue. That's the big one. I can't wait to illegally watch high guardian spice on kiss cartoon
01:08:17 Instead of kiss anime damn. Oh, what a savage
01:08:22 That's fucking sick. Uh, I will do that for sure
01:08:25 It means you got like the staff who made it like they themselves like I'll show them
01:08:29 I'll upload this to kiss anime myself
01:08:34 God
01:08:35 Yeah, so I think that whole like controversy is way fucking overblown
01:08:39 Did they ever sort of like even
01:08:41 Announce it as an anime?
01:08:44 What was that made did anyone like crunchy roll or the staff ever really call it an anime at any point?
01:08:51 No, no, but they are an anime company and the fact that they're using the money they make, you know
01:09:00 I'm just trying to see how pretentious
01:09:03 I mean, I do not think they've done that particular sin
01:09:06 Yeah, I feel like I feel like they would probably know if they were like, yeah, check out our new original anime
01:09:11 I'm pretty sure that would be you know what I kind of want them to that would be hilarious
01:09:15 Yeah, it would be pretty funny, but I feel like they're too much on the pulse to make such a people like complaining about the name
01:09:22 And I mean it is a fairly dumb. It is like whenever I heard it
01:09:26 Like it is a pretty dumb name, but then I thought about it a bit further now
01:09:30 I think the the main character is called rosemary if I remember correctly and yeah, they're all spices spice
01:09:37 Yeah, and I was thinking like well, maybe that's the thing the high guardian spice spice is kind of like maybe their group name or like
01:09:43 You know how ruby is our wbi, whatever
01:09:47 They basically wanted to make steven universe, but with condiments pretty much
01:09:51 I can't wait to see if I can salt and pepper the the the twins
01:09:55 That's a really cute idea
01:09:57 Oh, I can't wait to make my spice. Oh, see this is gonna be great. That was that was already and that was already in bethy
01:10:04 Yeah, this the blues clues fandom is gonna have some things to say
01:10:10 I want uh, what about I can't wait until uh, I can't wait until the new like the green ranger of the group, uh, horse radish joins
01:10:19 That's gonna be my thing and then the uh, the the asian hire wasabi will be a big
01:10:26 I
01:10:29 Was almost the same thing okay guys
01:10:31 But to be fair like if I didn't know about the whole staff the whole crunchy roll thing
01:10:36 Like all the controversies and I just saw the poster and like the art style and whatever
01:10:41 If I just saw that and knew nothing about it, I would be like, oh, that looks pretty neat. I'm kind of interested to see where it goes
01:10:47 I agree. Yeah, I think it's not offensive. The criticism is more specific than that. They're about right, you know
01:10:53 It's all like like that's the whole thing like that trailer was like the worst possible move to make
01:11:00 And they did it was so up their own asses. I just yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's true. It was pretty
01:11:07 The one thing that about that that actually made me annoyed is that they said you've never seen a show like this before
01:11:14 And I'm like, here's that stupid. What the heck out of here? I can't I can't imagine
01:11:19 Like the only reason they're saying that I think is because
01:11:22 You've never seen a show like this before because we've got the perspectives of people who are usually
01:11:28 Because the writing staff is 100 like it doesn't like the part. Yeah. Yeah, but like writing staff being agender
01:11:36 Agenda or another doesn't necessarily mean that the show is going to be something right like special
01:11:41 You know 99% of women are just normies like 99% of men are also just normies and they all have very similar opinions
01:11:48 I hate to break it to you guys
01:11:51 But uh, yeah, I mean that whole kind of shadow your glass ceiling all over you ladies
01:11:56 But uh, you know, I guess a man needs to do it every once in a while
01:11:59 So you can see the light all that glass of dr. Who shatters just all over the high guardian spice production
01:12:07 Edit that trailer so that the glass ceiling shatters and just the high guardian spices just come flying down
01:12:13 It's raining down onto the doctor and she says it's about time for high guardian spice on crunchy roll
01:12:22 Basil leaves flying everywhere
01:12:25 I just I like the idea of like people named after spices. It's cute. It's it's mage
01:12:31 How upset you're gonna be if none of this actually happens and it's just like not a thing
01:12:36 I will be very glad because I'm already I'm already standing salt and pepper. I love them
01:12:42 If they're not gonna be twins and they're not gonna be cute, I'll be very sad
01:12:47 Waiting for that horseradish. Yeah, it's gonna happen. It's gonna happen. Our version's already better
01:12:53 Let's all just look like Steven universe is our version of high guardian spice like every gem that everyone knows
01:12:58 Is the thing now in Steven universe? I'm waiting for uh, I'm waiting for a tarragon
01:13:03 Uh, who else we got we got uh, uh, ginger maybe ginger's around cumin
01:13:09 Definitely cumin
01:13:10 Uh, oh, oh wait a star anus wait shit. No, that's actually cool. I meant it to be funny, but it was actually cool. Fuck
01:13:17 lemongrass
01:13:20 Lemon grab ha ha. Uh, you got them. Um guys, uh, let me there was this shit. There was a topic. I wanted to say
01:13:27 It's a it's a uh
01:13:29 Way more serious thing and I completely forgot it. I'll get back to you when I remember. Fuck
01:13:34 That's what I have to say. You made you made smash brothers
01:13:37 Let's talk about the funny fucking earthquake that killed all of Japan. Oh, yeah
01:13:43 Let's talk about those problematic gamers guys
01:13:47 So there was an earthquake in japan recently in Hokkaido. Uh, it's true several people died
01:13:52 I think at least a dozen. I haven't kept track of the numbers
01:13:55 And because the next day there was a smash bros or actually it was not specifically smash bros
01:14:01 There's a nintendo direct that let's be honest. We all know there was going to be some smash stuff
01:14:04 And they delayed that and it has been several days and it's still delayed by the time you hear this
01:14:09 It'll probably be out fair viewer, but uh, but right now it's still delayed and uh, what's the deal? What's the deal?
01:14:16 Uh, I see people being like why are these gamers complaining about getting the thing delayed?
01:14:20 But uh, you know, I get why I'd like a human life is more important
01:14:24 But I don't actually understand the causal connection between delaying the trailer. I think it's really just um
01:14:32 Well, I guess like I don't know. Okay. Look if it is literally isek from uh, uh, from fucking, uh,
01:14:39 Golden sun who has earth shaking earthquake superpowers. I will very much understand why they delayed the trailer
01:14:47 It could have been like, oh, we can't now we can't we can't uh, show him at this time
01:14:53 What if he just gets cancelled?
01:14:56 No way. There's no way
01:14:58 That can't be holy shit. That would be this. Oh man. I mean look most likely
01:15:03 Uh, it's it's somebody else and this is just a delay because it's possible. There wasn't even any smash in the direct
01:15:09 It is possible. So you want to talk about you want to talk about like a company like cucking themselves way too long after the fact
01:15:15 Apple has an event on uh, this wednesday
01:15:19 On the uh announcing all the new iPhones and stuff. They announced that that's coming a couple weeks ago
01:15:24 However, it's a wednesday all like the vast majority of apple events when they announced these products is always on a tuesday
01:15:31 and the reason it's
01:15:33 The uh, uh wednesday is because it is wednesday the 12th because tuesday is september 11th
01:15:39 And they were too much of a pussy to fucking announce their new products on september 11. Okay, you know, uh, uh, uh, that is
01:15:47 Fairly pussy-ish, but but you know if they're just like look guys, we just don't imagine
01:15:52 How fucking sick would this be if like in the middle of the news cycle remembering 9 11? It's like great guys
01:15:57 We gotta stop talking about remembering 9 11. The new iPhones are out
01:16:02 Yeah, yeah
01:16:04 I kind of get on a corporate level. Why'd they do that? Just oh, I get it
01:16:08 I just think it'd be hilarious to just have to jump back and forth between 9 11
01:16:12 You could you could imply you could put like you could put like a little memorial thing in like the video for the new iPhone like
01:16:19 You know, uh, just like the default wallpaper of the new iPhones the freedom tower. You know what it is
01:16:24 You know what it is? It'll be like it'll be like um
01:16:27 The the the terrace tried to destroy america. Yeah, but we came back and we're stronger than ever with the new iPhone
01:16:35 You know why people won't like that. It's because people are made uncomfortable by capitalism
01:16:40 Uh, they don't like the idea of people like profiting off of other people's suffering. Which I get which I get
01:16:46 But you can you imagine the new iPhone, uh, 10 s with reinforced steel rails
01:16:53 You'll both melt this phone
01:16:56 The new 9 phone 11. Yes official for our fallen soldiers and heroes
01:17:01 I mean, it would be the iPhone 11 technically if the 10s the last year's version the 9 phone 11
01:17:07 Oh man, this is a change that the eye to a nine. We've done it team. There's so much good shit
01:17:12 I can't believe that we live in a world where this wouldn't be funny
01:17:16 They do like a the strength test where they where they fire a plane into
01:17:21 Like the jet fuel can't even melt the steel of this iPhone. It's too powerful
01:17:27 Oh, god
01:17:33 Mange you're not american you should you should be more than happy to indulge
01:17:37 No, I don't I'm not I'm not a particular fan of dark humor in general. That's that's the thing
01:17:42 It's not just this specifically lethal aurora mage. What's uh, are you saying you don't like black comedians?
01:17:54 Damn hashtag exposed. All right
01:17:57 Um, should should we should we like move on to questions mage has to leave soon. Yeah, I think it's about time

01:19:37 Well, it's a it's a three atom thick flat plane that is a spaceship somehow. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's yeah
01:19:44 God love battleship. Uh, okay. Well, I'll pass that on to munchie. We got to let munchie know
01:19:48 So he's the one with the highest christ consciousness
01:19:50 I feel that was directed at munchie to make him mad that a guy can touch turtles
01:19:55 You're right. I think oh my god. You're so right. That was actually a passive aggressive like
01:19:59 You can't touch turtles. Oh, man. I'm touching all these turtles. Well, maybe that's all that's so manila
01:20:06 Uh, all right next one we got uh, here's one from um, omni tanius. I think is how that's pronounced. Uh, hit us up
01:20:23 Is that a
01:20:26 Is that an accordion
01:20:29 Keyboard
01:20:38 Wow, was that was there was it was that going anywhere?
01:20:44 See you next week guys
01:20:47 Yeah, man, buddy
01:20:52 Oh, that was good. Um, all right, we are new outro
01:20:56 Oh new outro, new outro
01:20:59 Um, okay, here's one from um that fucking weird guy. Uh, all right. I don't remember calling into the show
01:21:10 Yo a question for the fuck boys, you know, Nate, digi, munchie, you know
01:21:15 Fuck boys and your head in this modern world where everyone's so fucking into them
01:21:19 So fucking the press and everyone want to fucking kill themselves
01:21:24 Because i'm a i'm a fucking high school boy and there's this girl I like and she loves music and I love music
01:21:30 And we share the love for music and we're very good friends
01:21:33 But I don't know what the fuck to do to make her my girlfriend
01:21:36 Uh, I don't know what the fuck to do and I don't know me. No me me answers. No fucking me me answers
01:21:43 Oh good. I feel so
01:21:46 Oh my god, I do a lot of existential fear and terror from the same
01:21:52 Doesn't he know that fear leads to anger and anger leads to hate and hate leads to suffering
01:21:57 It leads to no gf. So stop that right away. First first first tip. Uh, don't don't clip the mic when you speak to her
01:22:05 Girls girls hate it girls hate it when you clip the mic
01:22:09 You got to work on your gain control dude. That's step one. Wait. He said no meme answers
01:22:13 He uh, he was very specific about
01:22:16 He also specifically directed this to the fuck boys me digi and munchie, but yeah, feel free. Yeah
01:22:23 I think uh, no, I think I think we're no we're we all we all gotta wait
01:22:28 We all gotta weigh in and help and help this poor
01:22:31 Yeah, help this poor guy get get the get the lady that he originally deserves this is as it is as is his birthright as a proud white man
01:22:39 um, that's right
01:22:42 I think he's argentinian actually. Have you considered uh, have you considered have you considered stealing something dear to her and holding it hostage?
01:22:51 Do not listen to Ben
01:22:54 To to to be real if he has like he likes music and he knows she likes music then there's your answer
01:23:00 Just talk to her about music and then maybe find other things you like to figure it out
01:23:06 You know, I know this guy's main problem. This guy's main problem is that he's in the depths of the friend zone for sure
01:23:11 For sure. I mean, I'm not clear on if he even knows this girl at all. Like he said they're good friends
01:23:15 He said yeah, that was gonna be my thing is that dude you're you're too late. You're too late. You're too well
01:23:21 It's not too late. It's not too late, but here's what you here's the thing
01:23:26 Definitely uphill here. Well, here's what you gotta do. Here's it might be too late, but you know, you never know
01:23:32 You just gotta fucking say it
01:23:38 You just gotta say hey, I have feelings for you because yeah, if you do that may
01:23:42 And she doesn't reciprocate might it ruin your friendship? Yep, but guess what your friendship's already fucking exactly
01:23:48 It's already fucking weird because you feel this way in the first place
01:23:51 Yeah, you gotta you gotta man up and like if you get rejected you get ljbf
01:23:55 You gotta be like fine by and just so don't don't even fucking sweat it don't even sweat it bro
01:24:00 Ben is right but Ben is right
01:24:02 But the reason why like think about it like this the reason why it's a good idea to just say something instantly is because
01:24:09 That shows
01:24:10 Confidence is because that and like so but like and that's really the important thing here
01:24:15 Like if you want to actually get this girl, I know I said this is somebody in the past
01:24:19 But like okay, like it depends on how deep in the friend zone you are with this person
01:24:22 But here's what I would do if you want this girl
01:24:25 I would honestly assess your sexual market value. Are you actually someone who would you would want to date?
01:24:32 If not, then here's what you do
01:24:34 You begin working on that and becoming a better person and then you start dating other girls
01:24:39 You start dating other girls and you can do this in a cold sociopathic way
01:24:43 Just so you can get experience so you can come back and get this girl later
01:24:46 No, this is this is good. This will work. It will take time, but it does work. I know that's right
01:24:50 You will take a long time this guy that's gonna take like years and like but this is this is why I say that
01:24:56 There's no fucking time for there's there's no fucking time for that bullshit. I mean as it relates as it relates to this girl
01:25:02 He was a high school boy. So he only has a certain number of years to get it done before that
01:25:06 That's all the more reason to just you can just put it out there and then drop it if it doesn't work out
01:25:11 What do you mean you can have it done in a month? You can like totally change your whole public persona in a month
01:25:16 You can totally change you have
01:25:18 Okay, okay. Sorry. Everything here depends on how deep in the friend zone
01:25:22 He is only he knows that that is the crucial element here
01:25:25 If if this person if you like grew up with her
01:25:28 It's like it's been a long time and like you're just like her buddy and she doesn't think you're like cool or anything
01:25:34 And like what do you what would she want to date you if she just met you today for the first time?
01:25:39 That's that's an important question to ask
01:25:42 But like I look if you want the short the shortcut version
01:25:45 Uh, that's actually fine. I would say go with ben literally tell her instantly that you are into her and just don't delay
01:25:53 There's no reason to wait. It's fine
01:25:55 There is no reason to wait
01:25:56 But like I guess if you want to take a slower longer path that like if you need to work your way up
01:26:01 So that you would even possibly consider it
01:26:03 Then I would say literally stop being such good friends with her
01:26:07 And go do other things so that you don't like she needs to know that you are a valuable guy
01:26:12 Weird Machiavellian. I don't know. I don't know exactly what it is. That's how inter gender dynamics works. That's like like, okay
01:26:19 Yeah, you should go and work on yourself and improve your your sexual market value
01:26:24 Is you make make yourself a better a cooler and more more more interesting and attractive person that people want to be run
01:26:30 Obviously, you should do that. You should not do that for the purpose of getting this one girl. That's weird 100% right
01:26:37 That's right. Yeah, the real the real solution here
01:26:40 And I know that this is impossible the real solution is to not care about any one specific girl and have oneitis
01:26:46 It's to just you get it. Whatever like like like like
01:26:49 It's like it's already set in stone. Either this is on or it's off. I'm gonna be real. It's almost definitely off
01:26:56 But it doesn't matter
01:26:58 You should you should you should just say something anyway, because because nothing ventured nothing right right now
01:27:04 You're just suffering your own mental prison. Yeah, fuck that shit get out one way or the other
01:27:09 My strategy. Look, maybe my thought would I'm actually with ben here now that I've thought about it more
01:27:13 Literally just say like whatever dude. Don't make it a big romantic thing. Just like no whatever when you're hanging out with
01:27:18 Everyone's is like just to be like, hey, I like you like I want to date you or whatever
01:27:22 I think that you're really special and I like hanging out with you. Let's you know, I'd like to date
01:27:26 I think you're cute whatever
01:27:28 You just got to make it clear in some way and do not worry about the details too much
01:27:32 It's important that you just do it because that shows that you're a cool guy
01:27:36 That is someone worthy of dating her just by by not look every guy out there
01:27:40 Is is a pussy who likes a girl and doesn't just say something to her and I've been there too
01:27:45 I'm a pussy too in a lot of ways, but uh
01:27:48 Be not a pussy and just go for it and if it fails. Well, sorry about that buddy
01:27:53 But don't and don't go school shooter when you get rejected
01:27:59 That's an important step would be would be my final word on that
01:28:02 Oh god, no, we gave another meme answer now. He is gonna become a school shooter. We did what he said not to do
01:28:08 Nuts, we did our best
01:28:10 Okay, here's one. I think that was a pretty great answer. Yeah more than he deserved frankly
01:28:17 Um, here's one from the argentinian guy. Uh, let's see what we've got here
01:28:22 You're back and what's the deal with manji and his hate for south america and argentina
01:28:28 You know, we may have chosen they were on people to run our countries
01:28:32 We may be racist between each other
01:28:34 We may have forgotten the spirit that our ancestor had when making our countries free from the europeans and
01:28:44 Oh
01:28:53 Yeah, he's just responding to I think manji said something about he's in south america people
01:28:56 Oh, he realized he realized that manji was right. Does manji hate south america?
01:29:00 I mean, he was meman about it. He wasn't even about it. Yeah, okay
01:29:05 I mean manji's basically south american anyway. He's like a quarter mexican or something. So, you know, yeah, so it's the same thing
01:29:12 close enough
01:29:14 Wow, I mean nobody. Yeah, let's move on. I mean, I think I hate south america now after hearing all after hearing that
01:29:20 That argument. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. All right. Here's one from uh from one spar
01:29:25 Let's see what he's got for us
01:29:28 Hello procrastinators. Once again, it is one spar of one spar weekly indeed
01:29:33 This voicemail is not actually for you. This is for the viewers viewers
01:29:37 I am posting a public bounty right here right now
01:29:41 I'm looking for timestamps of
01:29:44 Nate bestman aka the quote unquote best quote unquote guy quote unquote ever
01:29:50 And specifically timestamps of him mentioning star fleet
01:29:55 That's right all timestamps of Nate bestman mentioning star fleet on the procrastinators podcast

01:30:27 Yeah, so what is the reward? He said a bounty
01:30:29 Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What's the what do you get?
01:30:32 I I think he needs to clarify a little bit. There are 124 episodes of the procrastinators podcast
01:30:39 That is like in the ballpark of like almost 400 hours worth of content. That is a lot of time invested
01:30:46 I want some financial
01:30:47 You just need 124 people to watch each one. That's true. That's true. See it's possible
01:30:52 You gotta pay a lot of people then
01:30:54 I mean, maybe the bounty is literally one cent. You know, he didn't specify. Maybe it's maybe it's a firm handshake
01:31:00 Maybe it's just credit in the video description
01:31:04 Did he did he say how to contact him?
01:31:07 He did not. Oh, well, he did say a one spar weekly. I bet if you google that he said on the page on the page
01:31:11 He said he's in the patreon discord order just leave it in the comments. Okay. Well, like well, I guess contact him there or somewhere
01:31:17 Oh, yeah, this may be a slightly out of date
01:31:20 Uh question
01:31:22 But I won't go into detail. Never mind. Well, I mean he he should know what did he die? Uh, he didn't die
01:31:29 Well, we talked today and he might be just like leaving the discord. So this might be in
01:31:34 Oh, no, so, you know, whatever figure it out. We've lost. We've lost a great ally today. Okay
01:31:40 That's weird. Yeah, it's just don't worry about it. It's fine. All right. Let's move on. Uh, okay. Never no question
01:31:47 Here's a question from from russell russell. Oh, no a resident ghoul
01:31:52 Oh, it's not russell. It's coming back. He haunts ben. He haunts me. Uh, he's a real problem. Let's let's see what he's got to say
01:32:01 I want to pose a hypothetical tea wall
01:32:04 Say you just returned from home from your nine to five having suffered allergies the whole day
01:32:09 Sneezing runny stuffy nose watery eyes the works
01:32:14 However, for tonight only
01:32:17 Stormy daniels is in town at your local titty bar as part of her making
01:32:24 Stay home
01:32:25 God russell's such a fucking villain. He is a villain. So just just to put us in a situation
01:32:30 We have to react to this evil question. It's just fucked up enough as is
01:32:34 Um, it's got a good voice. I didn't know what his voice was. Yeah, I'm looking up. I'm looking up stormy daniels
01:32:39 Make america horny again guys. Um, I've got to say well, she's not exactly my type. She's not exactly
01:32:46 Is to go look at least for
01:32:49 Is is to go and look
01:32:52 At least for like curiosity's sake. Yeah, I uh, you don't want to miss that. I don't think I mean
01:32:58 You want to be able to say I went to that and then people like wait, do I do I want that?
01:33:03 Ben, do you not want to make america horny again or what?
01:33:05 I would personally even if I was interested. I literally don't care interesting shit happens around me every single day
01:33:10 And I don't care. So and she loves dreams don't count me. She's not seeing any
01:33:16 I dreams dude, uh
01:33:19 I mean, uh, all right. All right. Well, I mean why you guys I'm not I'm not taking it for I'm not taking it for granted
01:33:25 That I'm interested in this event. Yeah, well fine. Ben
01:33:30 I think don't go. God damn it. It's it's it's it's impure. It's immoral
01:33:35 You know, I would know I would go I would go specifically to arrest her to place her under citizens arrest
01:33:41 What's she's doing? I would I would I would I would yeah, I would I would apprehend her and I would say in the name
01:33:48 Stop in the name of the law
01:33:50 Yeah, um, and I would you know, she actually did get arrested. Um a while back
01:33:55 Because uh, so there's a so there's this whole thing with she's like suing Donald trump or something
01:33:59 Um, but there was there was the situation where in in ohio
01:34:03 Is she the she's the one she's the one? Oh
01:34:07 Okay, she got arrested specifically for she was at a titty bar and in ohio where I live
01:34:12 And she let a patron touch her like like briefly in a I don't know
01:34:17 I like I don't think it was too hot and heavy at the moment
01:34:20 But like there was touching going on and that is illegal
01:34:22 So she got like arrested everyone thought it was like the libs thought this was a big over like uh
01:34:27 Look at them trump's trying to attack the person who's getting them
01:34:30 I don't know how trump was involved exactly but because it's like technically prostitution if
01:34:35 I mean yeah, it like crosses into that sort of field. I think which is why it's against the law
01:34:40 She's the one like like trump like got her pregnant or something
01:34:45 Allegedly trump had sex with her which I totally believe but I don't have proof of and uh,
01:34:51 He paid her hush money to keep her quiet about yeah
01:34:55 And specifically it's a campaign finance issue because like the money that may have been used came from a guy who ran
01:35:00 His thing which might have used the money from the from the campaign and then he paid him back
01:35:03 But was that legal like that's kind of the gist of it. It's not a legal fuck of a porn star and then
01:35:08 You know pay her off to keep quiet about it, but to use campaign money or is
01:35:12 But it could be if I mean maybe maybe we gotta we gotta push that now. I'm sure yeah after ben's done with us
01:35:18 It will be yeah, after after I after I arrest stormy daniels and and publicly execute her alongside all my rumbas
01:35:30 Stormy daniels can go but let me just leave the room. But wait
01:35:33 I think that the scariest thing about this voicemail wasn't even this this hypothetical
01:35:37 It's that even uh, once you're dead once you're a spirit, uh, you still have to suffer with allergies
01:35:42 Uh, what what a horrible thing. Oh, yeah, right. We forgot about the allergy thing
01:35:46 Or maybe maybe rustles mocking us because we all suffer from these human maladies of our physical bodies that he has been freed from
01:35:53 His superior ectoplasmic form has no such limitations. Yeah, maybe he's putting this this symptom on us
01:35:59 But not himself. He's made of he's made of shadows and poison. Yes, or something if I if I'm not if I'm not much mistaken
01:36:07 um
01:36:08 Hey, uh, I actually want to this is a topic that I let me let me bring this up
01:36:12 Let's talk about titty bars in general. I think the concept of titty bars is super weird
01:36:17 I've never been to one and I have so dumb
01:36:19 I have noticed in conjunction with like a strip club like the same thing or is that not are they not the same thing
01:36:25 Yeah, well, I'm asking you. I mean you did okay. I mean I think
01:36:29 I think there's I mean I've never I've never I've never been to a strip club or a titty bar or whatever
01:36:37 Anything like that and I don't I don't get the appeal at all. I think it's I don't
01:36:41 I'm 100% with you ben this idea in the age of internet porn. I don't see how this is in any way now ben
01:36:47 Ben still functioning would you say that ben if it was for example?
01:36:50 Like a brothel at least at least there's a reason to go wait. Is that an accurate statement? Wait wait wait say that again
01:36:56 You like if it was like instead of a titty bar if it was like a brothel
01:36:59 At least that sort of makes sense as to like why you'd go because you can like have sex with a woman or or a man or whatever
01:37:06 Yeah, yeah, sure. Yes. I understand. I understand the appeal of direct quote
01:37:10 Women don't matter unless I can have sex with them. That is what ben just said
01:37:13 He's confirmed this here on the pcb today. Please write that on his grave when he is executed
01:37:19 I don't know just like what what I don't know. I just I don't get it. What do you do?
01:37:23 Why why would you want?
01:37:24 Why would you want to go get a boner in public and be able to do nothing about it?
01:37:29 Like I like it seems weird to go by yourself and just kind of like get off privately to like, you know
01:37:36 Semi-nude girls walking around that seems weird
01:37:39 But it also seems weird to like go with friends or like go with go with people and like weird. Yeah
01:37:45 I don't know
01:37:47 But I feel like that's what most people I feel like most people like go with their bros and it's like, uh
01:37:51 Yeah
01:37:54 They jail each other
01:37:57 Because obviously the girl obviously the girls can't do it. It's you know, yeah, I guess that's true
01:38:02 That's true. We don't want a stormy daniel situation on you. You need you need that burst link squad
01:38:08 burst link squad
01:38:10 I mean
01:38:11 I guess I like I don't know like it is a bar and then they're just our naked women
01:38:16 So it's like okay, so it's got all the features of a bar plus. There are naked women like, okay
01:38:21 That's the naked women. See someone the naked women are a
01:38:24 Are a detraction at that point for me. Like I don't even like bars in general, but just like to have to have a distraction like that
01:38:31 Uh, does not sound fun to me at all
01:38:34 But like a distraction from what like drinking your beer at this bar. Here's okay. Yeah
01:38:40 Do you want to do you want to be like hanging out with like friends and just be like, oh, no
01:38:44 That girl's pretty hot now. I have a boner around my friends
01:38:47 I guess you could just go horrifying. I guess you could just go if you just wanted a drink like any other bar
01:38:53 Sure, however
01:38:54 I I'm I would be I would be put off by that because I feel like there would be this um
01:39:01 I feel like there'd be there's expectations on you like I because like the girls are there to the girls are there to make money
01:39:07 By by paying attention to guys and and you know getting like, you know
01:39:11 Getting them to tip them by by you know paying attention to them and making them feel good and and whatever and I don't
01:39:19 Okay, I I walk into a titty bar and and what I imagine would then happen is that you know, some girl would be would be like, okay
01:39:26 I'm gonna I'm gonna you know
01:39:27 I'm gonna go talk to him and and you know be nice to him
01:39:29 So he'll give me money and then I have this girl talking to me and and
01:39:35 You know, like I know it's fake, right? Like I know she's some some stranger
01:39:40 Yeah, good looking a good-looking stranger
01:39:42 I cannot think of a single thing more off-putting than the idea of a good-looking stranger
01:39:47 Coming up to me and acting really nice to me and me knowing that it is an act like that is
01:39:54 Horrifying well sure that that makes me a little sick to even say out loud
01:39:58 It's really the same thing with like a waitress
01:40:01 Who's like trying to get you to give her tips at the end of the meal because she's being really nice
01:40:06 I mean, sort of uh
01:40:08 It's sort of like that. Yeah, like I feel I feel that that that same type of awkwardness when with interactions like that
01:40:15 where they're always really nice to you even though that
01:40:18 There's something about the way that they maybe look at you as like, uh, you don't you
01:40:24 Yeah, I'm trying to eat being nice to my future money right now. I mean you guys. I think you guys are generally describing
01:40:30 Uh, what I would call millennial cowardice
01:40:33 You know the most part
01:40:35 Like I know look I know that this is like a share. I basically agree, but I think I'm afflicted as well
01:40:41 And it's like listen, you just be you're just being contrarian when a normal human
01:40:45 Not us but a normal human would like go out to be a social person just to like go out and like go to a bar
01:40:52 Whatever it is not a problem if someone like says anything to them
01:40:57 It's not a problem, but I feel like for our generation. It is a problem and like this is
01:41:04 Whoa, that is not that's you that's totally different than what I would just
01:41:08 Is there just a sense of insecurity about like being talked to by customer service people?
01:41:13 No, that's not the problem. You it's not that someone's talking to me. It's that someone is being fake to me
01:41:20 It's that someone is coming up to me and complimenting me
01:41:23 Yeah, it's different with a weight. It's different with a waiter. Oh, well sure. Okay. I just a real point here
01:41:31 That is a criticism of you and me. I have never been and neither have you
01:41:34 So are we not just talking out of our asses here as to what it's actually like at a place like this?
01:41:40 I I guess you're not wrong. Like maybe it's totally fine. Well, then fuck you too. So what so what so what's your angle here?
01:41:47 Well, I guess my angle is that I suppose it seems like I know there are people who enjoy it
01:41:51 So I good for them. I suppose and I have nothing further to say
01:41:55 I don't know if if you if you if you if you're a fan if you're a fan of strip clubs
01:41:59 And you think that I'm totally off base and what goes on there and and I and I'm mistaken and it's not like this
01:42:04 You know, leave a comment and explain why I'm wrong. You know, but you know, I've
01:42:09 But you know, I mean I've I've read about it like I've read I've read stories
01:42:12 I've read like stories from like women that work at them and I've you know, I've read people
01:42:16 I've heard people talk about their experiences going to them. This is the impression that I get of what goes on at these places
01:42:22 I there was one time in my life. I almost went to a strip club
01:42:25 And I know that makes me sound like a pussy because there's plenty of people who just have actually gone
01:42:28 But this is why one time once upon a time me and my friend Adam who I was working with at at a peer one up in
01:42:34 Up in Massachusetts
01:42:36 Like I found out that Lisa and the porn star was coming to Massachusetts to do like strip shows
01:42:43 Which she does and I am a fan of hers and I was very excited to go to this and I was like, let's do it
01:42:49 Now I basically pussied out by not following through because I was nervous and like, oh, this sounds like a real boy thing
01:42:55 I don't want to make myself embarrassed about
01:42:58 But I would have I wish that I had gone
01:43:00 I do wish I had gone
01:43:01 Just to see what it's like and to be more of a an actual human being and not a coward as I am
01:43:06 I mean, I kind of I kind of appreciate
01:43:09 Then the idea of an environment where it's okay to to look at the girls in a way that is like
01:43:16 Yeah, yeah, they they know why you're looking and that's fine. Yeah, like if I ever went that would be cool
01:43:22 I agree with hippo like
01:43:24 When like we're talking we're none of us experienced it. I'm guessing and like none of us are god. We're all such pussies
01:43:32 Mage is definitely gone for sure. He's the only one that's been
01:43:36 But no, no, I mean no particular interest or at least no no burning interest in going them. So like
01:43:42 We're not really talking with any sort of authority interest or even like knowledge of these things like
01:43:49 It reminds me
01:43:52 It reminds me of people who like
01:43:55 Talk shit about people who watch less plays or or some
01:43:59 Or listen to podcasts or whatever. Oh, it's just people talking
01:44:02 Oh, it's just why are you watching someone else play a game when you could be playing the game yourself, you know
01:44:07 I mean, I mean you could be playing a stripper. That's true
01:44:10 I see I see I see the I see the comparison. I see that I do see the comparison. I'm not judging anyone if they like
01:44:17 I'm just saying I'm just saying that the appeal of the
01:44:20 From what I understand. I don't see the appeal. We should go next rad con. We should go
01:44:26 Rad con entirely in rad con the divergining. That's let's call that and let's rid ourselves of this cursed virginity once and for all
01:44:35 Finally
01:44:37 We'll just title the video the burst length squad
01:44:41 That's good. And we'll wear the gopro
01:44:45 Okay, if if I'm there big if and we go there and I go you guys will have to come with me to a guy bar as well then
01:44:54 You know what that sounds funny
01:44:57 Yeah, I'm going to be completely honest. I'm not interested in either of them, but I I just want to go
01:45:04 I would believe a lot of ladies are looking to have sex on that day. So that's cool
01:45:10 Well, when's that not true?
01:45:11 Can you guys like send me candy corn? I never had candy corn. I've always been curious about it
01:45:16 I like candy corn. A lot of people shit on this and I think it's I think it's pretty good
01:45:22 Both sides and it's like you either love it or hate it. There's no one between and I really want to try
01:45:27 It's like a p.o. Box open a p.o. Box so people can send you candy. It's like sugar wax. It's pretty much what it is
01:45:32 It has a kind of a caramel taste
01:45:35 About a p.o. Box, but I'm not sure if there's anyone any any near me. So I don't
01:45:41 Uh, well fair enough. I mean, yeah, we post office around here. There's a bunch of them around
01:45:46 I opened a p.o. Box in georgia and um
01:45:50 Literally one person because people were saying they were going to send me stuff
01:45:55 Literally one person did
01:45:58 And and I didn't find out about it until after the p.o. Box had expired and I never got the package and I felt terrible
01:46:05 That's funny. People say a lot of things that they're definitely going to do
01:46:08 I don't believe or have faith in anyone. Uh, which is why my whole p.o. Box was formed around like
01:46:13 I give them something which is inclusion in weaguar and stuff. So that that keeps them coming that keeps them coming
01:46:19 Yep, yep
01:46:21 Hey, here's a question from uh at sam x amu 99 if given the choice
01:46:26 What would you do destroy anime or save anime? I think we all agree. Uh, it's time for it to go
01:46:37 Fully coolly was like 20 years ago and every it's been downhill ever since then have you seen fully coolly two and possibly three are like
01:46:44 I have I know that they're out. I haven't seen them. I don't want to I don't even want to acknowledge that they exist
01:46:50 I want to watch them
01:46:53 One day, I definitely will watch them and I probably will at some point
01:46:57 I'm not looking forward to the consensus though, Ben. You'll be happy to know is that they're way worse. So there's
01:47:03 Well, no, well, no, no, no, shit. Yeah. Yeah, who could have who could have seen this coming god damn it
01:47:09 I'm sorry. I have to read this question. I actually I feel like I've seen a pretty mixed response
01:47:14 Like it seems like people are not entirely negative on them, which is deeply disappointing and but yeah
01:47:20 Yeah, I mean they're probably I mean as long as as long as people
01:47:24 As long as people know that it's no it's not the original. That's I guess it's fine
01:47:29 Yeah, yeah, I just I hate that you have like the original good things getting buried under sequels and spinoffs and that's
01:47:36 As long as that I mean that's probably not gonna happen here, but whatever. What was that made?
01:47:39 You mentioned some sort of question and and then oh, yeah, uh, here's a question that I'm sorry
01:47:44 But I'm just selfishly going to answer it's at alien observer asks
01:47:47 When will Nate realize that communism is the ultimate weird utilitarian mode of production?
01:47:52 And also myth but a card is literally called Karl Marx
01:47:55 God, I think this is a total meme and he's just like mocking me and getting me all upset because fucking starfleet is not
01:48:02 communist you pieces of trash
01:48:05 I just hey, there's one answer this last way
01:48:08 Wait, there's one sign one one time stem for you talking about starfish plate thing
01:48:13 That the oh, yeah, there you go. That's that's a free one. Everyone go claim that bounty. Yeah, that's right. Get your one set everybody
01:48:19 um
01:48:20 I'm just gonna say uh, I'm just gonna give the short version here
01:48:24 Uh starfleet is post
01:48:26 Uh, what what's the word post something scarcely post scarcely the normal economic models
01:48:31 We have no longer apply uh in the same way they do now
01:48:34 So you cannot think of it in the same way stop being silly alien observer and everybody else out there
01:48:40 All right, who's got another question?
01:48:43 Let's see what we got. Let's see what we got. Um, I can tell you guys are being lazy and not looking
01:48:48 His only mage and I have offered them
01:48:50 Uh, oh god, okay. Yeah, you're right. Oh, you're right. I'll look
01:48:54 God, I'll look at them and I'll know if they're bad. Yeah. Well, I mean we that's a safe assumption
01:48:59 Um, uh rocks and asks, uh, do you hate all tabletops or just dnd because there is a cool pokemon tabletop
01:49:07 Are you guys on this excuse?
01:49:09 I have I have a I have a legendary video defending dnd from ben's bullshit
01:49:13 And I have an equally legendary video assaulting tom for for his terrified
01:49:19 Dnd in concept, but I've never really experienced it in practice. I liked it till the end
01:49:25 D the the the the act of getting together to play dnd is
01:49:31 Usually a nightmare
01:49:33 For one pcp, we should all gather and play dnd for two hours
01:49:37 I would I would play dnd with the pcp. I would do that. Um, but it's not something that I want
01:49:43 But it's not no
01:49:44 Terrible, it's not something that I want a lot of in my life. It's a big hassle. I don't know. It's been it's it's fun
01:49:51 I don't know. I guess
01:49:52 I don't I don't I don't disagree if anyone thinks it is fun or or under or because I get it but
01:49:59 I don't know. Um, so we'll but like like in in general
01:50:03 In general my problems with dnd extend to all tabletops
01:50:06 But I do think that there are there are other tabletops that I think are better than dnd
01:50:11 Like mutants and masterminds. I think is is pretty neat. Um, for example, and just generally generally
01:50:18 That that's that's a pretty rules heavy one, but in general I think that rules
01:50:22 Uh, it's it's got kind of a class. It's not really like a class based system. So yes, basically
01:50:28 Yeah, you can basically do it. You basically do it. I mean like settlers of katan and that kind of shit. No, no
01:50:35 Yeah, okay. All right, you know, you know, let me tell you a little anecdote
01:50:38 I think I think I just want to say I think that the like the more rules light a game is the more
01:50:43 I'll probably be disposed to like it. Yes. Also. I like there's kind of the shorter the better
01:50:48 Just like I don't want to play for like months and months in one campaign
01:50:51 I would love to sit down for like one time playing and uh, which I know is kind of not what tabletops are designed for
01:50:57 But that's why I don't play tabletops
01:51:00 Um, uh, but I was going to say on this the other day. Uh, this wasn't a tabletop
01:51:03 This is a board game thing
01:51:04 But I just I walked downstairs out of my apartment and I see there's like a there's like a little thing
01:51:09 Uh, like a little kind of glass enclosure, um, where I live that like another person lives in and I see a guy in there
01:51:15 Like my my my not my roommate, but like another guy who lives whatever in the same place I do and I see him like with friends
01:51:21 Uh, a bunch of guys gathered around us in a circle playing a board game
01:51:25 And I'm just my face is pressed up to the glass and I'm like, I want to play too
01:51:30 I want to have fun with friends. Um, but I didn't and I never will that's it
01:51:37 That's the story
01:51:40 Wonderful, uh, there was another question I liked. Oh, here we go. This is an important question from uh gays
01:51:45 Guys eric gais eric. Okay. It's um when society inevitably breaks down and the gamers rise up
01:51:52 What will your be your loadout fellow gamers magic?
01:51:57 I don't know. Oh, well, I'll definitely use my mace. Um, yeah, good. Definitely use my mace, uh, from the video
01:52:03 Where I smashed the mouse. I actually do have to leave because I have stuff to do before I go
01:52:08 Okay, mage quick. What's your loadout?
01:52:12 Magic that's not real mage magic
01:52:14 You have to be a real gamer
01:52:18 No
01:52:22 And she's gonna throw them at people
01:52:25 I don't know
01:52:27 Being killed to the black mage will be one of the the helpless
01:52:30 Lambs that are slaughtered by me and my gamer crew when we roll through
01:52:34 Yeah, yeah, all right. She'll she'll have she'll have the creative us
01:52:42 She'll have her roblox character to defend. I don't I don't know anything about that. Um,
01:52:48 All right, mage. Well, we'll see you later if you got to go. No worries. Okay. Goodbye everyone. Get the hell out of here
01:52:55 Halo energy sword, uh, and uh, the sniper rifle and, uh,
01:53:01 This needler. I mean needling everybody. That's yeah, that's me. I halo weapons
01:53:06 I'd use I'd use the stealth boy from fallout to go completely invisible and then shank you from behind
01:53:13 sense
01:53:15 I probably use the rules here amaze my real weapons amaze in one hand and I don't know how this works
01:53:21 Probably use a shotgun. I like shotguns. I like like scattershot buckshot kind of weapons. They're cool
01:53:26 I want that grappling hook shotgun from the new doom game coming out. That looks pretty helpful. Yeah, that looks pretty useful
01:53:32 Oh, fucking I get the hook shot from legend of zelda. What the double hook? How sick by the way was getting the double hook shot in
01:53:39 Twilight princess that was like my favorite upgrade ever. It was so fucking sick
01:53:43 Just saying just saying
01:53:45 Gamers rise up everybody. It's time. I want when I say gamers rise up
01:53:51 Do they mean like the nuclear fallout will give gamers the ability to make video games real life
01:53:58 Yeah, to make their favorite video game
01:54:01 Manifest destiny the only manifest destiny that ever mattered was games becoming real life. That's what needs to happen
01:54:06 What if the pcp got trapped inside their favorite video games? Oh my god. Oh
01:54:11 Yeah, what were you saying?
01:54:13 What if I became sad?
01:54:17 We're already living life sans video games, which is paying enough for me
01:54:21 Are you the undertaler would become sans in this reality? That's probably true
01:54:26 Yeah, um, all right. That's enough questions. I think we're done here folks. I think I think we're good. We're like just at two hours
