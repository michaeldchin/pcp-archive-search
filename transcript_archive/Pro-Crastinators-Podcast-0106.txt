00:00:00 Hello everybody, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's me, Hippocrit, the guy, and we've
00:00:13 got with us a big packed car. We're on a summer vacation. It's all hot and sweaty in
00:00:18 the car. Clown car. Yeah, there's too many people in here. We're sticking to each other.
00:00:23 It's gross. We got Munchy here. I'm a sequel of 9-11, like a soft reboot. You know how
00:00:28 like Godzilla solely went from being an antagonist to a protagnist? That's like 9-11 in me.
00:00:35 We got Nate. I am the best Jihadist ever. That's the terrorism episode. We got Davoo.
00:00:47 Munchy, on your comment about how Godzilla went from bad guy to good guy, Rambo is similar.
00:00:51 He starts off as just like a violent maniac antihero in the first movie. Then he becomes
00:00:55 a hero. Then he becomes sort of a mixture in the fourth movie. Godzilla and Rambo should
00:00:58 actually do a crossover. They have so much in common. They're both accidental byproducts
00:01:01 of war. So what you're saying is you're a soft reboot of the Holocaust, Davoo? Sometimes.
00:01:09 We have Mage. The heroineys? That's a word. Mage coming out swinging. We have a Tom. Everyone
00:01:22 has been saying a lot of words in these intros, and I find them to be overly verbose and
00:01:29 bloated. The spirit is lacking. Bad show. And the man of the fewest words, Ben St. A man
00:01:37 of no words, preferably. There he goes. There he goes. Look, I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
00:01:42 He was doing the joke, and you interrupted his silence. Well, I didn't. I was proved
00:01:48 the fool. All right. Everybody today's episode is confusing because some people think it's
00:01:55 called words, but it's actually language. Language in general. I mean, I can go on for
00:02:02 ages. I have notes written in language in words about language and words that I will
00:02:09 get to maybe. There's so many people here. I'm doubtful that I'll actually get to Amish
00:02:14 Go. Just go. Just start. All right. Oh, wait, Urban Dictionary, though. Computer language.
00:02:21 Wait, I got it. I've got language. Break the structure. Check it out. No. Language. Urban
00:02:26 Dictionary. A way of humiliation. The leader of this episode. You can't just take over.
00:02:32 But he didn't want to read it, so I'm just doing it anyway. Urban Dictionary is a dictionary.
00:02:38 Therefore language. It sucks. Listen to this one. Listen to this one. This is a meme, though.
00:02:42 Okay, language. Wait, it's a meme, everyone. What your fucking horse is. Language. What
00:02:46 your mother claims movies she doesn't want you to see has too much of C, swear, and you
00:02:52 know what? You know what? That leads perfectly into my point. Language sucks, and it's bad,
00:02:58 and it doesn't do the job it's supposed to do. Wait, can we quickly segregate ourselves
00:03:03 to pro and anti-language? Can we be sure? I'm pro. I am pro. I am pro. I am pro. Munchie,
00:03:10 the God King is pro-language. This is the pro-languineders podcast. Wait, okay. Just
00:03:16 keep your anti-language. Say I. I. What language? If you're anti-language, if you hate it with
00:03:23 a burning passion, if you want it dead, I, me, me. So those of you keeping score at home,
00:03:29 that is DeVoo, Nate, and Hippo on the Axis powers, and everyone else is on. No, it's not
00:03:33 DeVoo. DeVoo, yeah, DeVoo wasn't actually. So is it just Hippo and Nate? I think so.
00:03:39 Cowardly green boys. The cowards fighting on the losing side. Cowardly green. We will
00:03:48 win. You are the Dark Souls boss to our rolling and stabbering. That is so unique. I never
00:03:55 would have guessed that the minority opinion would be that language isn't good. I would
00:03:59 have never suspected that. And there's nothing weaker and more pitiful than a Dark Souls
00:04:04 boss. Well, I mean, you know, I use a lot of language, and I feel like this. I feel like
00:04:09 this. It's like, like you got guys who are on the extreme left. Nate, please communicate
00:04:12 your ideas without using language. It's impossible. No, but I'll tell you why. You can't do it.
00:04:17 You've lost. As soon as you explain anything, you've lost the argument. You're using the
00:04:21 tool that you hate. Incorrect. Incorrect. We can, we, see, I have a solution. We've
00:04:25 forced this on him. Everybody shut the hell up. Let me make my goddamn point. Everything
00:04:31 about, everything about hap, everything happening here is entirely in my favor and probably makes
00:04:36 as well. He's right. He's right. Language is a terrible tool. Which because it is a translator.
00:04:41 It translates thoughts, feelings and ideas into a package that has to be untranslated
00:04:46 by the recipient. And the recipient can like misinterpret things. Anything written down.
00:04:54 You can't, like speech is better than stuff written down, but speech is still not as good
00:04:59 as just actually experiencing real things. Yeah, well, you know what else? Google and
00:05:04 Apple can't release a patch and change the word rifle to water gun. Well, they could,
00:05:09 but they haven't yet. So there you go. I don't know what that is in playing as your argument.
00:05:14 And I don't know what your argument is. Why words are better than emoji. Okay, but listen,
00:05:18 well, sure, but listen to this though. It's like people in the far left, for example,
00:05:22 like hate, wait, wait, no, no, it's just an analogy. It's like people in the far left,
00:05:26 for example, hate the Democratic party because they're not left enough. And like that makes
00:05:32 the mad at that. Cause like they're not, they're, they're the ones who quote unquote like represent
00:05:36 their ideas, but they don't do it like well enough for their taste. In that same vein,
00:05:40 I am mad at language for not like I use it a lot. It's, it is a tool I use, but it's
00:05:44 not good enough at doing what I want to do. And that's why Munchy, you should be on board
00:05:48 for this as should you Tom. Cause what I want is whenever I meet someone, I don't want to
00:05:52 use this bullshit language, shitty analog system we've got right now. I want to literally
00:05:56 pull out my fucking cord, like it goes to the shelves, jack it into your fucking neck
00:06:01 and have the raw, unfiltered data stream of my real life shit into your body.
00:06:05 You fucking coward. Don't you want to like what that's language too? That's a digital
00:06:09 language. You're converting it into a computer language.
00:06:12 All right.
00:06:13 Everything in reality as a language, I'm defining you as a language.
00:06:18 Language is a form of communication and doesn't have to be verbally. It can also be a language.
00:06:25 Is every, is every communication language is my question.
00:06:27 Yes.
00:06:28 Fuck language is just like a hyperbolic clickbait. And what you really want is just more words.
00:06:32 No, no, no. You guys are dead wrong. You're misrepresenting your own points. Okay. Okay.
00:06:36 You know what? You know what? We should have a hundred percent of all calamities.
00:06:41 Listen, hey, everyone, I want to make a prediction. I want to make a prediction. I want to make
00:06:46 a prediction. Speaking.
00:06:47 I want to predict something right now. I see, okay, I am the greatest mind of our generation.
00:06:51 My mind is so vast that it contains all of your own minds within it. I know exactly where
00:06:56 this conversation is going. And I already have the groundbreaking point that will smash
00:07:01 everything that is about to be said entirely asunder. But I'm going to wait. I'm going
00:07:05 to wait on it until later.
00:07:06 Okay, no. I just want to point out that once you say that in our mental retardation.
00:07:10 Okay. Davoo, Davoo, what were you saying?
00:07:12 You've called me out on that multiple times, dude, and I've done it explicitly to like make
00:07:16 you upset, except that's not actually true. I say that I'm just retarded, but I want to
00:07:20 hide behind like a veil of me doing intentionally so people will think that I'm cool, but I
00:07:25 actually just say hi.
00:07:26 Look at these terrible words you're using. I just don't even care about anything. They're
00:07:28 all bad.
00:07:29 Representation of points is the reason I don't like what I call language. See, this is the
00:07:35 whole point. Language, as I think of it, is like text and speech and stuff, not communication
00:07:42 on the whole. Like communication obviously is a good thing.
00:07:45 What's the word? What's lexicon communication?
00:07:47 What I'm talking about is like speaking and the written word as like more specific forms
00:07:53 of communication. Here's the thing. Language, well, I'm going to call it that. I'm going
00:07:58 to continue calling it language because calling it words and speech is kind of...
00:08:01 Yeah. For what words do you mean nothing? We might as well, right? That just helped
00:08:04 your point.
00:08:05 The fact that you guys defined all communication as language.
00:08:09 Nate, it's literally called body language.
00:08:12 Exactly. There is an adjective attached to that to differentiate the two from just the
00:08:17 broader point.
00:08:18 It's not even that we are correct and you were all wrong.
00:08:21 Yeah, we've got to be on the same page here.
00:08:23 It's all like a fucking... It's a mess. I've got so many different specific points to go
00:08:30 into.
00:08:31 No, no, okay. It's all about...
00:08:33 I'm going to start with one of my points. The specificity of language is a boon. It
00:08:41 helps us to do a lot of things, but it is a curse when all of humanity is linked together.
00:08:50 It's weird how it sucks is what I'm saying. It sucks because...
00:08:56 Yeah, okay.
00:08:57 Right. First of all, I'm not very good at using it.
00:09:00 Look at Twitter, dude.
00:09:01 Here's an example, though.
00:09:02 I do have notes. I just didn't write them in a way that I could read them.
00:09:04 Oh, no.
00:09:05 Okay.
00:09:06 I feel like you're confirmation bias saying...
00:09:07 I didn't write a speech. I wrote, like, here's a point that I can expand on.
00:09:13 The specificity of language is you have words meaning specific things, but it only works
00:09:18 in small communities like tribes, where everybody can decide on a word, and if a word's meaning
00:09:24 is changed, everybody in the tribe can be like, oh, okay, that's different, so deliberate
00:09:29 on that.
00:09:30 Can I give an example?
00:09:31 Can I give an example of that?
00:09:32 That's brilliant.
00:09:33 And the bigger the tribe gets, the more people that are supposed to, and expected to use
00:09:37 a word, they have to look to an authority, but there is no authority because the dictionary
00:09:42 is reactionary to the way people use language, and that just results in divides when people
00:09:48 can't decide on the new or the old definition of a word, such as, you know, literally being
00:09:53 used in, like, a figurative sense as written in the dictionary now, because that's how
00:09:58 people have been using it or misusing it. It's just, language creates barriers between
00:10:04 people because we're such a huge conglomeration of human beings, and it should be for small
00:10:10 sections and small communities having their own language.
00:10:13 First world problems, bro.
00:10:15 Pretty so, but listen to this, here's the exact, this is a word that the poor definition
00:10:19 of it is indicative of the problem with language at large, and I, like, I think what you guys,
00:10:25 what your side and our side will commonly clash over this entire podcast is like, but
00:10:29 isn't it better than nothing?
00:10:31 And the answer is yes. The answer is absolutely yes, but there are still problems, and I think
00:10:35 that's what we're going to be talking about.
00:10:36 Okay, here's the word.
00:10:37 The word is racism.
00:10:39 The word is racism, and the problem is that different huge groups, for example, in America,
00:10:45 use that word in completely different ways, but because there are multiple definitions
00:10:49 for that word, it causes huge misunderstandings, see Sky Williams' video on the subject.
00:10:54 Is it multiple definitions of the word?
00:10:55 There's one definition of, no, no, no, there's one definition of the word, and then there's
00:10:59 a whole political subset that has taken that word and changed it to mean something else
00:11:04 to...
00:11:05 Is that a difference?
00:11:06 Is that any way different from having multiple definitions of a word?
00:11:10 That's a problem with people and ideology, not with language.
00:11:15 My point, my problem is there's too many people using the same language where we should
00:11:19 be...
00:11:20 Not that we should be, but the way the language was invented was it makes sense for the small
00:11:26 tribes.
00:11:27 A word only means what people think it means, and if there's no consensus on what it means,
00:11:32 then it's not useful to use because it causes arguments.
00:11:36 The problem right now is there's a big problem because the internet has created this problem.
00:11:41 Made this problem way bigger than it ever was in history.
00:11:43 I agree with what you're saying, how language has problems with multiple interpretations
00:11:47 and how words change over time, but the specific example Nate's using isn't a natural evolution
00:11:53 of language.
00:11:54 It's a very conscious choice to twist something to suit an agenda.
00:11:59 Maybe that's true, but that is completely irrelevant to the point that just the reality
00:12:04 is it is simply used these ways.
00:12:06 And like you...
00:12:07 Okay, like I sound like the SJW side of things right now, but it's just like, I don't actually
00:12:12 care who's right or wrong about what the word originally meant or who's twisting it
00:12:17 for an agenda.
00:12:18 All I care about is that there is a miscommunication going on and people are talking past each
00:12:22 other, and that is the problem with language.
00:12:25 And that's exactly what Gibb is talking about.
00:12:28 Just for example, you've got SJWs...
00:12:31 Okay, but let me just finish this real quick, just take a second.
00:12:34 It's just that you've got a camp that just views the world from a situation where racism
00:12:39 means prejudice plus power.
00:12:41 And you've got just this other camp that just believes to their core that it simply means
00:12:45 discrimination based on race and power is irrelevant.
00:12:49 Because these people are so deeply entrenched in believing these things, it doesn't matter
00:12:53 where it came from.
00:12:54 This is simply where we are right now.
00:12:55 We can absolutely talk about why it's a problem that we got here, but it is the reality that
00:13:00 people just can't agree on what they're talking about.
00:13:03 That is not a problem with language.
00:13:06 That was done on purpose to make it medial.
00:13:08 Language facilitates this issue.
00:13:09 Let me speak.
00:13:10 Let me.
00:13:11 Language is a tool like any other.
00:13:14 Blaming language in itself for the faults of humans is like blaming water for people
00:13:18 who drowned in it.
00:13:19 Just because people can't drown in it doesn't mean the water is supposed to be blamed for
00:13:23 it.
00:13:24 No, no, no, wrong.
00:13:25 Okay, go on Gibb.
00:13:26 The thing I should make my argument more specific, it's not that language sucks.
00:13:32 I just say that because that's funny and you're like, oh, you're being all hyperbole.
00:13:36 We're all about the memes here.
00:13:37 We're all about the hyperbole.
00:13:38 Where are the memes?
00:13:39 Well, there they are.
00:13:41 I hate it.
00:13:42 What my point is, is that the way language developed initially was like we were banging
00:13:48 rocks together and people were grunting and we were like, what is this thing that is different
00:13:53 from this other thing?
00:13:54 And they came up with words.
00:13:55 I mean, I don't know how it happened, but eventually over time, people invented words
00:14:00 to mean certain things and they were like specific to wherever they lived and whatever
00:14:03 they had.
00:14:05 And that's why languages are like different all over the world.
00:14:09 And when a language spreads to other places, it becomes difficult to police, like keep
00:14:17 the language consistent among all those different places.
00:14:22 Okay, but that's not the languages fault also, like because of the internet.
00:14:26 No, this is what I was getting to.
00:14:28 My point is not that language sucks, it's that language over a large amount of people,
00:14:33 like too large.
00:14:35 It stops being useful for communication, which was its primary purpose in the first
00:14:40 place is to communicate ideas.
00:14:42 If between different groups that are like, there's too many people and so many large
00:14:47 groups of people have different interpretations of certain words, then the point of language
00:14:52 becomes, well, the point of language is lost, like that certain words are not able to be
00:14:57 communicated properly between people.
00:14:59 They have ideas, they have thoughts, and they're using words that other people don't agree
00:15:03 with.
00:15:05 Like in a magical world where we didn't need them, we could like telepathically transmit
00:15:10 ideas into people's heads, that would be better.
00:15:12 Not possible.
00:15:13 Give me that USB point, boy.
00:15:14 But that's my argument, that like when there's too many people using the same language, it
00:15:19 will inevitably stop being useful as a tool.
00:15:22 No.
00:15:23 Are you saying that we've reached that point or just that will theoretically happen in the
00:15:26 future?
00:15:27 Have we reached that point now?
00:15:29 Is that what you're saying?
00:15:31 We're facing the issues as a result of it for sure.
00:15:34 Give language time to catch up, the internet was invented just like how many years ago?
00:15:39 Mage, here's why it'll never happen, Mage, this will always be a fundamental problem
00:15:43 with language.
00:15:44 Okay, to your credit, you do have a point.
00:15:48 Given enough words and given enough time, like the reason people write articles, right,
00:15:53 to flesh out arguments and they write books to explain things, the problem is there is
00:15:58 a fundamental problem with human beings and language, because human beings just read headlines,
00:16:04 we just read titles, we read condensations of points that other people present to us,
00:16:09 and that is because asking someone to read a fully articulated point.
00:16:12 We watch analytical YouTube videos explaining the anime to us instead of watching the damn
00:16:17 anime.
00:16:18 Yeah, exactly.
00:16:19 I mean that is kind of an issue, yeah.
00:16:21 The problem is we're asking too much of the weak flesh of human beings to spend the time
00:16:27 to learn things, and people can get over it, of course they can, but they don't, enough.
00:16:33 And this is a problem that people just don't want to spend the time reading something when
00:16:37 they can get a shorter version.
00:16:38 But I was supporting my national point about blaming water where it's the people who are
00:16:42 being dumb.
00:16:43 So language is bad because people are lazy for some things?
00:16:45 Are you fucking retarded?
00:16:46 That's the dumbest point I've ever heard.
00:16:48 Yeah, what the fuck?
00:16:49 Language is bad because people are lazy.
00:16:52 That is your point right now.
00:16:53 You guys want to just say that like, oh well humans can always adapt and change, but you're
00:16:58 not facing the reality.
00:16:59 No, the reality is some people are shit and some people aren't shit and that has nothing
00:17:03 to do with language.
00:17:04 Okay, okay, yeah, I understand what you're saying that like it's just human nature that
00:17:08 that's how people are gonna read, but like, but I don't see how that's language, like
00:17:12 that's not language's fault.
00:17:14 Yeah, actually, you know what, no, it is language's fault.
00:17:16 Nate, I agree with your point to the point that it proves your point wrong.
00:17:19 What you get down to the core of this is that people in their eternal laziness try to find
00:17:25 some sort of tool or technique or a secret trick to just make it easier for them or to
00:17:30 take the effort out of it, like reading the headline instead of the article or thinking
00:17:34 it's possible to have some form of word-based lexiconal communication that allows you to
00:17:39 actually make everyone understand you all the time.
00:17:41 Maybe there's no easy way out, no shortcut home, you just have to learn how different
00:17:45 people use words every step of your way through as you go on through life.
00:17:49 Words are like a martial art technique.
00:17:51 You must master it, experience each fight that comes along the way and improvise and
00:17:57 be smart.
00:17:58 There's no, we aren't a bunch of computers all manufactured in the same Chinese sweatshop.
00:18:01 We're not all the same.
00:18:02 Even if you can communicate dream to dream, dream brains aren't all made the same.
00:18:06 There's no easy way out.
00:18:07 You just gotta fucking be smart and put a lot of effort in to communicate all the time.
00:18:11 Yes, yes.
00:18:12 And the fact that that is all true is the problem with language, that is the problem.
00:18:16 So you're saying that language sucks because people spread fake news on Facebook and that
00:18:22 this specific problem with internet headlines, that's the reason why language is flawed.
00:18:28 The problem is that language is an incredibly inefficient medium for which us to acquire
00:18:33 information and people just don't put in the work to do so and it's because language is
00:18:38 so shit at it.
00:18:40 The point is...
00:18:42 Those two are intellect.
00:18:43 So what do you want?
00:19:13 I agree.
00:19:14 I agree.
00:19:15 I agree.
00:19:17 I agree.
00:19:18 I agree.
00:19:19 Well, I agree.
00:19:42 That is true.
00:19:44 Well, I have real experiences in less talking, less reading, less text.
00:19:49 There is a language of visuals, there's a language of visual art.
00:19:54 How?
00:19:55 Wait, wait.
00:19:56 I said earlier that I'm talking about text and speech, visual art is like I'm not talking
00:20:00 about language in general.
00:20:01 I have a couple things, I have a couple things.
00:20:04 First of all, I think visual language is a double-edged sword because it can be more
00:20:10 specific in some ways, but can also be way more abstract than language in other ways.
00:20:14 You can draw a picture and it can clearly represent something literally, but if you're
00:20:19 trying to communicate something subtextually with an image, it's way more vague than text.
00:20:23 So that's a problem, but Nate, are you trying to say that your argument is that we need
00:20:30 some form of language that instantaneously downloads an entire article's worth of content
00:20:35 into someone's brain along with all the context for every single word choice behind it from
00:20:40 that person's point of view?
00:20:42 Is that what you want?
00:20:43 I am saying, if such a fictional thing existed, then that would be a better option to give
00:20:48 people all the information for each point.
00:20:50 Then sure, science fiction is definitely better than reality.
00:20:52 I will give you that point.
00:20:54 But considering that...
00:20:55 But that is every...
00:20:56 I think that is...
00:20:57 That language is not perfect, is my point.
00:20:58 Yeah, that is it.
00:20:59 Well, congratulations.
00:21:00 Nothing's perfect.
00:21:01 Yeah.
00:21:02 This is what a completely useless point.
00:21:03 So what do you want then?
00:21:04 You want me to just say, yeah, it's perfect.
00:21:05 I guess I'll just say...
00:21:06 No!
00:21:07 It's not perfect!
00:21:08 Who wants language to be perfect?
00:21:09 Okay, I don't...
00:21:10 You guys are literally worse than Hitler.
00:21:11 You're oppressing my ideas.
00:21:12 You don't care about the Jewish people like me.
00:21:14 Fuck you guys.
00:21:15 I don't...
00:21:16 Why do you want to abolish Israel?
00:21:17 Tell me why.
00:21:18 Just tell me why.
00:21:19 I don't particularly disagree with what I think is like the morsel of truth here.
00:21:23 But it's just a gross hyperbole.
00:21:26 And I don't understand why you guys are taking this to like the most instant degree.
00:21:30 Yeah, why does the fact that it's...
00:21:31 I don't understand why the fact that it has problems mean that it's bad.
00:21:34 You guys are literally just mad that I'm articulating the problems with language.
00:21:38 That is you right now.
00:21:39 No, I'm mad that you're saying that these problems mean that they are a net negative
00:21:44 and that language is bad.
00:21:45 If we abolish...
00:21:46 Do you think that things would be better if we abolish language?
00:21:49 Of course not.
00:21:50 I think that's exactly what I said.
00:21:52 Exactly what I said.
00:21:53 That it's not actually about language just being an overall negative.
00:21:55 I said it's a boon.
00:21:56 I said it's a boon.
00:21:57 Maybe fucking talking about...
00:21:58 We came out...
00:21:59 The problem is we came with this from a meme.
00:22:00 That's the whole problem.
00:22:01 We've been talking about this...
00:22:02 We said a meme that language is bad.
00:22:03 That's not actually true.
00:22:04 It's a meme.
00:22:05 You dip.
00:22:06 Visual language is like fucking...
00:22:09 People only taught with the visual language back in the medieval times to teach the Bible,
00:22:13 Jesus.
00:22:14 And I'm thinking...
00:22:15 They only talked about visual language?
00:22:16 What do you mean?
00:22:18 Visual communication, right?
00:22:19 They just have fucking stained glass windows to tell the whole Bible stories, right?
00:22:23 Didn't they have the Bible though?
00:22:25 Yeah, but those people couldn't read back in the day.
00:22:28 They're all uneducated.
00:22:30 That's why all those mobs had to illuminate all those manuscripts.
00:22:33 Right.
00:22:34 They had to illuminate all those manuscripts.
00:22:36 I'm thinking about it.
00:22:37 I'm fucking thinking about it.
00:22:39 If the Second Amendment had been, instead of any words, had been a guy just with his
00:22:44 family holding a gun and then a police officer taking the gun, but there's a red X over that,
00:22:49 there'd probably be a lot less room for miscommunication, I suppose.
00:22:53 If you think about...
00:22:54 I mean, maybe.
00:22:55 If you go to a fast food store, you see that little yellow sign, it'll say something in
00:22:58 Spanish that means, you know, don't slip.
00:23:00 Like with that image, it could be interpreted as a guy taking away the gun from the officer.
00:23:05 I mean, that is...
00:23:06 It could be interpreted different ways.
00:23:08 That open...
00:23:09 Visual mediums just open up a whole, like, different set of possible issues, you know?
00:23:13 And we can get into that.
00:23:14 But I think...
00:23:15 I want to say a point, though, before everyone started yelling.
00:23:18 I think language is a tool, just like any other.
00:23:21 Like I stated, you don't blame the pencil if you can't draw, you don't blame the brush
00:23:28 if you can't paint, you know?
00:23:30 You can't blame the chisel if you can't sculpt.
00:23:33 So why are you blaming the language if you can't use it as a tool to communicate effectively?
00:23:37 Because this is why, mate.
00:23:38 Because this is why.
00:23:39 Because, like, when I'm signing a check, I do blame the pencil if I use to sign the
00:23:44 check because it is not doing everything I want it to do, i.e. actually inking.
00:23:48 It's just, like, it is doing a different, not as good job as the tool I would ideally use.
00:23:53 What do you want a language to do?
00:23:56 A better analogy for that, Nate, is that, you know, language is like a paintbrush.
00:24:03 And, like, you know, a canvas is whatever.
00:24:06 It used to be, you dip your paintbrush, it's a tiny little paintbrush, you dip it in,
00:24:11 and then you can fill in like a square, like a one centimeter square.
00:24:15 Fill that in real quick, real easy, when the square is small.
00:24:18 When the square is, like, 200 feet long and 300 feet tall, and you still have that same
00:24:24 paintbrush, it's the same tool, it's just not as effective as it once was.
00:24:29 The paintbrush isn't the same, though.
00:24:31 There's also a multitude of colors.
00:24:32 You don't blame the paintbrush, you just blame the situation.
00:24:34 The situation is there are too many people that use the English language for the English language
00:24:39 to be a really good form of communication between everybody.
00:24:42 I love the English language as a non-native speaker.
00:24:45 I really love it because it's so broad and has so many words to describe the same things.
00:24:50 It's literally, like, it's almost the same to me as drawing because you can shape your words
00:24:56 like your sentences into specific things.
00:24:58 I like role-playing with people via text because I can shape sentences to reflect what I want to say
00:25:04 and make, like, it's reading the replies, it's like watching art because I love it,
00:25:09 I love how unique it can be, like, you can use different words.
00:25:14 You got different words for, like, the animal, like, you got pigs and then you got pork
00:25:17 because that's the way, like, English evolved is just be peasants used to use the word pig
00:25:23 to kill shit.
00:25:24 Don't misunderstand.
00:25:26 Don't misunderstand me.
00:25:27 I love a lot of things about the English language, specifically how, like, looking at a word like yesterday
00:25:34 and then understanding that yester is like a thing that you can apply to other words,
00:25:38 like yester year and yester week.
00:25:39 Like, seeing how words come into being, puns, like, I love so much of stuff about language.
00:25:46 I love puns and I think, like, is there any other language that has puns, by the way?
00:25:51 I'm just curious.
00:25:52 Of course.
00:25:53 Japanese has tons of puns.
00:25:54 What?
00:25:55 Japanese.
00:25:56 Oh, okay.
00:25:57 Yeah, okay, that's good because I don't think Lithuanians are very good at puns.
00:25:59 Lithuanians don't have puns?
00:26:01 That's outrageous.
00:26:02 Well, because I tried to explain to my mother what a pun was because, like, a long story,
00:26:07 but, like, she seemed very confused.
00:26:09 I was like, wait, don't we have puns?
00:26:11 So, like, if there's any Lithuanians listening right now, if you know any Lithuanian puns,
00:26:16 please let me know.
00:26:17 Post some Lithuanian puns.
00:26:19 Post some Lithuanian puns in the comments.
00:26:21 You know, not to be mean or anything, but I feel like I'm watching, like, a kid's cartoon
00:26:24 and, like, the little imp goes back to, like, the evil dark impville and they try to teach
00:26:29 their family about happiness and smiles.
00:26:31 What is this sharing you're speaking of?
00:26:35 What is this?
00:26:36 Agreed.
00:26:37 Okay, but listen, listen.
00:26:38 Like, we are currently experiencing what my problem is with language, and it is a large
00:26:43 issue, and I'm perfectly willing to say that.
00:26:45 And, like, it ties into Ben's question that he asked before.
00:26:47 What do you want language to do?
00:26:49 Okay, so that is a great question, and the whole reason for screaming and yelling, I
00:26:54 think we basically are all on the same page, but, okay, let me approach it.
00:26:56 It's like, me and Gib are viewing this conversation from the perspective of how things are not
00:27:05 perfect with language.
00:27:06 Whereas, I think someone like Maze, just for example, is approaching this as how the
00:27:10 world would be worse without language.
00:27:12 So, to have language, she sees all the benefits.
00:27:15 So, she's focused on the positives and is like, well, how can you say, you know, language
00:27:19 is shit?
00:27:20 It does all these good things.
00:27:21 That's a perfectly reasonable thing to say.
00:27:22 I think because we're approaching it from different perspectives, that's the issue.
00:27:26 I'm not saying languages, but you're saying fucked language.
00:27:29 I'm sorry, I'm sorry if this comes off as shitty or anything.
00:27:32 I'm sorry if this pisses you off.
00:27:34 But I'm really waiting for you to get to the point.
00:27:37 I have many times already.
00:27:39 I do disagree, though, on how you described my view.
00:27:42 No, my view is a language is a tool and it's up to the people how they use it.
00:27:48 If they do a shitty job, that's not the language's fault.
00:27:51 If your point is that language is imperfect, then, you know, gotcha.
00:27:56 Message received.
00:27:57 Yeah.
00:27:58 I mean, podcast over.
00:28:00 But listen, listen, though.
00:28:02 Ben's question, what do you want language to do?
00:28:04 Okay, that's what this all hinges on.
00:28:06 I want, like, language is what it is.
00:28:09 It, like, again, we're talking like spoken and like written language.
00:28:11 Like, that just, it is what it is.
00:28:13 It can't really change that much.
00:28:15 You could probably update with, like, Esperanto they're trying to.
00:28:17 That's fine.
00:28:18 But there are inherent limitations.
00:28:19 Like, what I want is a better form of communication that, for example-
00:28:22 So, like, a different language.
00:28:24 It's, you're defining communication as language, which I think is just wrong.
00:28:29 Because there are things that are not language.
00:28:31 Okay, no, no, now you're, now you're hopping because like-
00:28:33 Well, then I'm telling you, I'm telling you right now, I'm talking about spoken and written language.
00:28:38 I don't care about anything else.
00:28:40 But just now, you just contradicted yourself.
00:28:43 Listen.
00:28:44 Have you-
00:28:45 Tell me how I contradicted myself.
00:28:46 Yeah.
00:28:47 Okay, well, I don't think we agree.
00:28:49 Okay, you don't seem, okay, I don't get why you don't think that any form of communication is a language.
00:28:54 I think that it definitely is.
00:28:56 And I think that, yeah, text and speech is imperfect and can be improved upon.
00:29:01 But like, it's, you're not gonna, like, you can only iterate on it and make it better.
00:29:07 You can't replace it with something else that does the same thing.
00:29:11 But I'm not trying to say it does the exact same thing.
00:29:14 Also, listen to the definition of language.
00:29:17 A body of words and the systems for their use common to a people who are of the same community or nation,
00:29:24 the same geographical area.
00:29:25 Listen, it's words make up language.
00:29:28 If you're not communicating with words, it's not a language.
00:29:31 Okay, well, I'm sure I could find some alternate definitions that do not-
00:29:35 Oh, yes.
00:29:36 Because, yeah, that's not the only kind of language there is.
00:29:40 Okay, there's one down here.
00:29:41 There's another definition that says communication of meaning in any way.
00:29:46 So now, here's the question.
00:29:47 Yeah.
00:29:48 Are you wrong or am I wrong or are we both sort of right?
00:29:52 What's, what is it?
00:29:54 It's up to you to define it.
00:29:56 Exactly.
00:29:57 Yeah, I guess we're arguing across definitions a little bit.
00:30:00 Exactly.
00:30:01 It is shitty.
00:30:02 Exactly.
00:30:03 And therefore, a problem with language.
00:30:05 Thank you, everyone.
00:30:06 Okay, well, I guess I've been blown out of the water.
00:30:10 I guess I've just been completely-
00:30:12 That solves nothing.
00:30:14 That point does not change.
00:30:15 Even we had some magic psychic language where we could instantly say things.
00:30:19 If I disagreed with your fucking definition of language, it doesn't matter if I could
00:30:24 understand what you meant perfectly.
00:30:25 I'd still disagree.
00:30:26 This change is nothing.
00:30:27 This is not a plea to make the world more agreeable.
00:30:32 This is just like, you know, sometimes I kind of get mad that people don't agree on words.
00:30:38 That's all my point.
00:30:39 Well, I mean, my point is more specific to something not quite what Nate is going for,
00:30:44 I think.
00:30:45 But like, you know, the classic thing, pictures worth a thousand words and all that.
00:30:51 Pictures are good.
00:30:52 They convey a lot of meaning and a lot of things that words can't do quite as well.
00:30:57 My favorite expression, don't say.
00:31:00 Well, more than that is that if I were to either explain a story of a baby being born
00:31:09 and then the mother dying or something like a tragic story, oh no, it's sad.
00:31:14 If I were to explain that with words, even if I was really good at speaking, even if
00:31:17 I was really good at writing, it wouldn't work quite as much as like being there and
00:31:22 like seeing the tragedy like unfold before you.
00:31:25 It wouldn't hit you as hard.
00:31:27 And I feel like not that you're supposed to go out into the world and see tragedy.
00:31:31 That's not really the good thing that you, in fact, tragedy is bad and please don't actually
00:31:36 happen.
00:31:37 But if you would tragedy, spare us.
00:31:40 I feel like people spend a lot of their fucking time talking on the Internet.
00:31:47 And I think they would be much happier and much more fulfilled in life if they just forget
00:31:53 about speaking for once and do something real in the real world and Pokemon Go.
00:31:58 I agree with your point.
00:32:00 But I don't know why you're like, you're like, you're taking that point and channeling
00:32:05 it into like language is bad.
00:32:07 Like I agree that people should go and experience the things and not like just like communicate
00:32:12 through art or words or whatever.
00:32:14 Okay.
00:32:15 And just fantasize about like the abstraction of it.
00:32:17 But I don't understand why that is focused directly onto language.
00:32:20 Well, I think how Nate has sort of co-opted my feelings on the matter.
00:32:24 I don't speak for myself.
00:32:26 We just so happen to be like kind of on the same side.
00:32:29 I'm not like saying language sucks and I don't think we should get rid of language.
00:32:32 I don't think anything should happen to language.
00:32:34 I'm just like, wouldn't it be nice if you just sort of like you sit on you sit out on the beach
00:32:41 and you just sort of look at someone you smile and you can share a moment with each other.
00:32:44 And it's like, you don't need to say, I'm happy that you don't need to draw a picture about it.
00:32:48 You just sort of like you feel it.
00:32:50 You feel it more innately and more real.
00:32:52 There are things that words can't describe and those are very...
00:32:54 Yeah.
00:32:55 Have you guys...
00:32:56 Words that can't describe.
00:32:57 Have you guys...
00:32:58 I'm completely on you with that.
00:32:59 Have you guys ever heard the phrase, writing about music is like dancing about architecture?
00:33:05 Yeah.
00:33:06 Yeah.
00:33:07 I just thought that was interesting.
00:33:09 Please continue.
00:33:10 I do agree with Hippo and it doesn't invalidate my opinion whatsoever.
00:33:14 Oh man.
00:33:15 You know what guys?
00:33:16 I think I want to just say that even if words aren't the best communication or far from the worst
00:33:21 because dancing, like interpretive dancing.
00:33:23 Okay, let's see.
00:33:24 She spun around.
00:33:26 She spun around 90 degrees.
00:33:28 Okay.
00:33:29 Oh, now she spun around 180 degrees.
00:33:31 Okay.
00:33:32 Is this Morse?
00:33:33 Oh, she jumped.
00:33:34 Oh man, this totally is like the fucking Renaissance period, right?
00:33:39 Oh man, here comes some Bohemian shaking your hand around a little bit.
00:33:43 Oh, I totally understand this language.
00:33:45 Definitely.
00:33:46 I'm not bored.
00:33:47 Definitely.
00:33:48 I'm glad you brought this up.
00:33:50 I feel like we need to dig into the issue that like the definition, Nate, the definition
00:33:56 that you were using, like you were defining like a linguistic language like English or
00:34:01 French, but like I think it's more and I'd rather talk about language in the more abstract
00:34:07 way, but there's a thing like the language of like cinema, you know, or body language
00:34:12 or things like that.
00:34:13 Okay, now just the point that is distinct from everything I made points about previously.
00:34:17 I was not talking about anything besides the spoken and written word and I'm happy to talk
00:34:21 about that, but like those points do not apply in the same way.
00:34:25 Okay, well, how are you guys pro or anti language in general, like the language of cinema?
00:34:31 Pro communication, so yeah.
00:34:34 Well, okay, let me just say as a larger point, so we made a huge mistake about having a serious
00:34:40 discussion on this matter by even taking a for or against position.
00:34:44 It's like this.
00:34:45 My position here is that there are imperfections with the theoretically ideal form of communication
00:34:52 I envision in my brain that the spoken and written word have it is not perfect.
00:34:58 In my opinion, these are large issues and they cause big problems.
00:35:03 We can then but like, but I want to just identify what those problems are.
00:35:08 That is what it like to say that I'm anti language puts a huge label on like I'm in this team,
00:35:14 you're in that team, and then we just argue that is a huge mistake if you want to have
00:35:18 an actual debate as to like, or not not even debate, just a discussion about what the actual
00:35:23 points are.
00:35:24 Yeah, labels themselves are badly used words.
00:35:27 No one has brought in the idea that language is perfect besides you.
00:35:32 Like none of us have said that language is perfect in any way.
00:35:35 That's not I am not debating that you think language is perfect.
00:35:39 I'm simply saying language has these problems and I think they're a big deal.
00:35:44 Alright, well, I think we're well past the point.
00:35:46 I don't think anyone disagrees with that idea, but the way you've been phrasing it.
00:35:49 Then why were you arguing with me?
00:35:51 Because you were expressing it.
00:35:53 When did I ever say that?
00:35:55 I very much appreciate that.
00:35:57 I think Nate's got us all got you all in a little trick and little ruse.
00:36:01 Nate has been arguing his point by using language really, really badly to explain his point.
00:36:06 Nate, thus proving the point in an old and rare double reach around.
00:36:11 I'm literally a thousand times smarter than all of you.
00:36:15 You are ants.
00:36:16 You are babies.
00:36:17 You are children.
00:36:18 We've been doing this show for over a hundred episodes now.
00:36:29 And in that time, I've heard you discuss many a topic.
00:36:32 And I think this topic more than any has maybe realized with no uncertainty of how miserable it must be to be you sometimes.
00:36:40 To be trapped in this endless intellectual masturbation of all these incredibly insane ideas
00:36:48 and having to just constantly be thinking about them and unable to just let them go.
00:36:54 Hashtag fucking earned.
00:36:55 Hashtag fucking earned.
00:36:57 Yeah, I think about things more than you guys.
00:36:59 That's true.
00:37:00 What a miserable existence you must lead.
00:37:03 Someone's got to do it.
00:37:05 Thank God it's not me.
00:37:08 And death is the key.
00:37:10 If you can get away from the central institute right here.
00:37:12 I would like to do one pro-language little point here that I think me and Ben can get into on this.
00:37:18 This is the reason why language is great.
00:37:20 Give me something to sink my teeth into.
00:37:22 There are big words and there are rare words.
00:37:25 You have your commoner, pig-slop-speak.
00:37:28 You have your ants and thes and hellos.
00:37:32 But then you bring out shit like keroskero.
00:37:35 Oh, what's another big one?
00:37:36 Is that English?
00:37:37 Or Tentious?
00:37:38 It's Italian.
00:37:39 Antidisestablishmentarianism.
00:37:40 Antidisestablishmentarianism.
00:37:41 Yeah, there it is.
00:37:42 You've got big shit like that.
00:37:43 And I love, I fucking love to break out big words and rare words.
00:37:48 It's like getting a Pokemon card.
00:37:50 It's getting like a holographic Pokemon card.
00:37:52 You're reading an essay, you're listening to something.
00:37:54 He says a big fucking word and you go, wow, that guy's fucking smart.
00:37:58 And it's great.
00:37:59 Okay, yeah, that does support my point.
00:38:01 I'll just quickly adjust it.
00:38:03 Rather than language being a paintbrush, rather language is a paint and you're the paintbrush.
00:38:08 So whatever picture, like, and it's up to you to paint the picture that you want to paint.
00:38:12 You know?
00:38:13 And so language is kind of like that.
00:38:14 Each word is a color and you have to, you know, make it all come together.
00:38:17 I mean, in Japan, that's quite literal.
00:38:19 Language is like a bunch of Jenga blocks and your sentences are the tower.
00:38:26 Oh.
00:38:27 The curves are something.
00:38:28 And they all come tumbling down.
00:38:30 And you know what?
00:38:32 Some sort of data link that communicates all context, all the points that you're going to make
00:38:37 that just instantly transferred that information would be a better,
00:38:40 would be a skyscraper that was invincible and indestructible.
00:38:43 Nate, fight me on this.
00:38:45 How is that?
00:38:46 How is the data link or some kind of like digital data transfer between minds?
00:38:50 How is that not just using another language?
00:38:53 How is that not just converting things to computer language?
00:38:56 I'm still confused.
00:38:57 If you're arguing arguments, none of us suggested.
00:39:00 You're just arguing your own damn ideas.
00:39:03 But see, but see, you saying, but you saying that language is good in these ways is in fact a completely separate.
00:39:08 I'm not saying language is just good.
00:39:09 I never said language is good.
00:39:11 I said language is the tool.
00:39:12 You literally said language is good way before.
00:39:15 Language is good.
00:39:16 You fucking asshole.
00:39:17 And I agree.
00:39:18 And I agree.
00:39:19 But that's not my point.
00:39:20 Then what the fuck are you talking about?
00:39:22 That's not perfect.
00:39:23 Nate's point is that it's not perfect.
00:39:26 I need to say it's a tool.
00:39:28 You use it.
00:39:29 If you use it poorly, it happens.
00:39:31 Oh my God.
00:39:32 You just don't.
00:39:33 Nate, the problem is that, let me, let's go back.
00:39:37 Hippo, what was the last time you bought Pokemon cards?
00:39:41 I got it a couple months ago and it got a hollow in my first pack.
00:39:44 Why don't you get out of my eardrum?
00:39:45 It's hurts.
00:39:46 I lost two cents.
00:39:48 Stop by hating us some more.
00:39:50 We're just talking past each other's problems.
00:39:52 I actually have a point to make.
00:39:53 I just came up with, but it's something I've always opinionated.
00:39:55 Do you really think that I think language has no value, even though I distinctly said that's not the case?
00:39:59 No.
00:40:00 Nate, the problem is...
00:40:01 God damn it.
00:40:03 Okay.
00:40:04 I'm pissed off.
00:40:05 Nate, I'm pissed off this time.
00:40:06 This is why he wants a better alternative for language, because he can't use the one we have.
00:40:11 Let me tell you, Nate, the ambiguity...
00:40:13 I don't understand any of your points against me.
00:40:15 No, it's just funny.
00:40:17 The ambiguity and misunderstandability of words is, saves as many lives, prevents as many wars as it causes.
00:40:24 If someone asks, oh, hey, person at the grocery store, how are you today?
00:40:28 Dude, you're literally making that up.
00:40:30 You have no justification for that.
00:40:32 Can I just...
00:40:33 I want to go back to an example that you said, Nate, just not to argue, but just to request clarification.
00:40:40 Okay.
00:40:41 I want to better understand your position for the sake of extending an olive branch.
00:40:45 One of the first examples you cited was talking about the racism definition and how there's multiple definitions,
00:40:51 and that causes confusion and that's a weakness in language.
00:40:55 What I am trying to figure out is because you're saying that we need a superior version of language
00:41:01 where we can kind of communicate all subtext and all meaning in addition to the points we're saying.
00:41:08 But using that specific example, if somebody who's a super far-left, crazy, regressive, lefty kind of guy
00:41:17 was able to communicate this way and communicated their idea of racism, whatever,
00:41:22 instantly into someone else's brain who had the more traditional definition.
00:41:26 How would that change anything?
00:41:28 Because the person...
00:41:29 I'm so glad you asked.
00:41:30 I'm so glad you asked.
00:41:31 I have a point to make about this.
00:41:33 I will make it later.
00:41:34 Motherfuckers, I'm going to say it.
00:41:36 Give me some time, but I'll really get back to it.
00:41:39 Okay, but Tom, that's a great question.
00:41:42 I'm really glad you asked.
00:41:43 Okay, here's how.
00:41:45 Because I would argue that because people are using, for example, the different definition of the word racism,
00:41:50 they're using the same word, but they mean different things.
00:41:52 That means they are not actually debating the ideas of one versus on the same level.
00:41:58 So again, somebody who uses the older version of the word saying that, for example, saying minorities can be racist,
00:42:08 and then you've got a big SJW saying, no, minorities can't be racist,
00:42:11 but they're not actually saying the same thing.
00:42:14 They're not actually debating the same idea, and therefore a real communication,
00:42:19 a real examination of those same ideas is not happening.
00:42:22 If they just knew, if both sides knew exactly what the other meant,
00:42:26 and we removed the ambiguity of the word, they could...
00:42:29 The person would say, well, like, oh, okay, like the right-wing person would say, for example, here,
00:42:33 like, oh, I get it.
00:42:34 You're saying that privilege is real, and I could admit that to some degree,
00:42:38 but I still think it is bad to discriminate based on race across the board.
00:42:42 And if the left-wing person with the new definition is saying, oh, okay, like, it's good that you accept that,
00:42:48 and what we actually disagree on is if it's, like, okay, to discriminate against people who have power,
00:42:55 you know, for example, like, white people who are the majority in America.
00:42:58 If we're having that debate, that is a substantive debate, which I think is just way better.
00:43:02 Do you not think that that's happening in the vast majority of cases when this debate is being had?
00:43:08 Absolutely not.
00:43:09 I've read articles and listened to videos of people using the regressive lefty form of racism,
00:43:17 and I understand the position they're coming from, and I still think it's retarded.
00:43:21 But, Tom, would you say, would you say, Tom, that even if, as you say, the majority do that,
00:43:26 if there's even a good chunk of people who are making this mistake, wouldn't it be nice if that didn't happen?
00:43:32 I mean, I can't solve other people's issues of stupidity.
00:43:36 Well, I think you guys are talking about different things.
00:43:39 Nate, what you're saying is just that the conversation is a non-starter,
00:43:45 because from the very beginning, when both parties are using the same word, the same signifier,
00:43:51 to mean different things, then no real communication is taking place.
00:43:55 Exactly.
00:43:56 Like, it would all be fine if we could make two different words for those two different things
00:44:00 than the conversation, like, saying nothing about who's right or who's wrong.
00:44:04 Just the conversation could then proceed in earnest.
00:44:08 That is exactly right, Ben. Thank you.
00:44:10 The ambiguity of language is invaluable.
00:44:13 It's how our society is made.
00:44:15 It's the fact that we can say a thing, and we could have different ideas of that thing,
00:44:19 but we can still, sometimes, still kind of carry along.
00:44:23 And if we did data link for everything, and you're in the store and someone goes,
00:44:26 hey, how are you today? And the answer is, I would have fucking killed somebody!
00:44:30 You know, that would be kind of hard to go to the grocery store.
00:44:33 Wait, wait, wait, so you're saying it's better to not know that there are murderous people around us?
00:44:38 If you had the ability to just suck your brain right into someone's actual thoughts,
00:44:44 you'd be running and scampering up, down, left, right for your life.
00:44:47 That should be like a video game or something, I don't know.
00:44:49 You don't have to broadcast your thoughts to anybody.
00:44:52 I mean, even in this theoretical situation.
00:44:54 Oh, what's that thing in the psychopath's code?
00:44:57 You're a motherfucking...
00:44:58 Psychopath.
00:44:59 ...utilitarian society, where all of our mouths are sealed shut,
00:45:04 and we all have USBs in our fucking necks.
00:45:06 A bunch of nosy people will start poking around their USB cords,
00:45:10 trying to poke you, trying to surprise you.
00:45:12 Like, boop, plugged in, now I get to know exactly what you're thinking.
00:45:15 And it's like, fuck you!
00:45:16 Devote, devote.
00:45:17 I want hate sex with you.
00:45:19 I'm happy to make hyperbolic statements.
00:45:22 I like language because language is anarchy. That's nice.
00:45:24 Language is anarchy.
00:45:26 I don't like anarchy.
00:45:28 I want to talk about datalink.
00:45:29 I want to pick apart the idea.
00:45:31 I want to pick apart the idea that we could somehow circumvent
00:45:35 an imperfect language through the use of some kind of datalink.
00:45:39 We can do that if you want, but I think that's a huge waste of time
00:45:42 because I'm not actually trying to defend this whole podcast.
00:45:45 I agree.
00:45:46 This podcast sucks.
00:45:47 Why does everybody think this is a huge waste of time?
00:45:49 This has been a great podcast.
00:45:51 It's been a great discussion. I've really enjoyed it.
00:45:53 I'm not trying to defend myself.
00:45:54 I just think to attack this hypothetical system,
00:45:56 I'm not actually trying to defend a hypothetical system.
00:45:58 I'm just promoting one way that we could improve language.
00:46:01 You and people throw out this idea
00:46:05 that if we could just digitize our thoughts
00:46:07 and communicate them directly to each other,
00:46:09 that we would somehow know more about each other.
00:46:12 But I say that that is just a different version of the same thing
00:46:17 because you're still converting to a shared language, a computer language.
00:46:22 And ultimately, okay, here's what I want to throw out
00:46:25 and I think we could discuss it,
00:46:27 or maybe everyone will think it's a big waste of time, in which case, whatever.
00:46:30 Fuck you.
00:46:31 Are our thoughts, are our innermost thoughts
00:46:34 like a language of their own, or are they language-less?
00:46:37 Yeah, I think so.
00:46:38 The different brains are different, obviously.
00:46:40 If we were to date up the language as it is now,
00:46:43 it's a translation tool to get things out of your brain.
00:46:46 Right.
00:46:47 But do they originate?
00:46:50 In your brain, do they originate as pure thought,
00:46:54 or is pure thought happening in an inner language?
00:46:58 Don't you think people will find a way to manipulate those thoughts anyway
00:47:02 and just not be honest in some way?
00:47:05 People will do that.
00:47:06 Humans have fucking glands and things that create emotions.
00:47:14 I'm trying to think of the words, I can't think of the words.
00:47:18 Humans feel lust and rage and sadness and all these things,
00:47:23 and those are caused by chemicals in the brain.
00:47:26 Fill in all those right now.
00:47:27 Well, question.
00:47:28 Question.
00:47:29 Does an English speaker think in English,
00:47:33 or do they think in an inner language and then translate to English?
00:47:36 I think what happens is that when you're...
00:47:38 I mean, that's on the internet.
00:47:40 ...before you learn the language.
00:47:43 I think you probably don't have specific words for those things.
00:47:48 I think as we grow older and learn our first language,
00:47:51 that's how we identify things.
00:47:53 This is something I've thought about sometimes too,
00:47:55 because I've always thought about learning other languages,
00:47:57 and people who have learned other languages,
00:47:59 your internal monologue is always going on.
00:48:02 And like, Mage, maybe this is a question for you
00:48:04 because you don't speak English.
00:48:06 Because I don't...
00:48:07 Yes, she does.
00:48:08 You don't speak English.
00:48:11 I don't speak English at all.
00:48:13 Yeah.
00:48:14 Oh, shit.
00:48:15 I have no idea what that meant.
00:48:17 My point is that, like...
00:48:20 If I learned another language,
00:48:23 my brain would probably still be thinking primarily in English,
00:48:26 and I'd be translating to that other language.
00:48:28 So is your internal monologue still in Lithuanian,
00:48:31 or does English poke in there every now and then?
00:48:34 Actually, for me personally,
00:48:36 I can't say this is for everyone because it's probably not,
00:48:39 but for me personally, my internal monologue is English.
00:48:42 And I usually...
00:48:43 Wow.
00:48:44 I default to Lithuanian usually when I start counting things.
00:48:47 Nice.
00:48:48 That's usually the only time.
00:48:50 Well, the only Lithuanian allowed on this podcast
00:48:53 is Lithuanian puns, so...
00:48:56 I feel like there's a difference.
00:48:58 There's a difference in the brain,
00:49:00 in the mind-brain-thought-brain tank.
00:49:02 Between, like, monologues and thoughts,
00:49:05 I feel like I don't think in words
00:49:09 until I think about thinking in words,
00:49:11 and then I can't stop thinking in words until I forget.
00:49:13 And then I'm like,
00:49:14 oh wait, have I been thinking in words all this time?
00:49:16 Or have I been thinking in, like,
00:49:18 just a nebulous sort of feeling,
00:49:20 like a gut instinct sort of thing?
00:49:22 The scientific reason for that is because, like,
00:49:24 you have your neocortex,
00:49:25 which is the newest part of your brain,
00:49:27 and that's our capacity for languages.
00:49:29 But then we have the limbic brain,
00:49:31 which is where decision-making and emotion comes from,
00:49:34 and that has no capacity for language.
00:49:36 So when you're thinking emotionally,
00:49:37 your brain isn't even thinking with words,
00:49:39 because the part of your brain doing all...
00:49:41 Oh yeah, and we can turn those signals into...
00:49:44 And we can brainwave,
00:49:46 blast them with a thing.
00:49:48 But emotions are sometimes irrational,
00:49:50 and if you communicate your emotions,
00:49:52 there's going to be a lot of miscommunication.
00:49:54 Do you ever fucking notice,
00:49:56 do you ever fucking notice that, like,
00:49:58 something will happen or someone will even say something,
00:50:00 and you have a reaction,
00:50:02 like, maybe a second later,
00:50:04 do you even, like, realize why you had that reaction?
00:50:06 Like, you don't need it.
00:50:08 You react the offense before you even actually
00:50:11 understand why you're offended.
00:50:13 I have that sometimes to do,
00:50:15 but I think it's just because I'm a child.
00:50:17 I don't know what the problem is for everyone else.
00:50:19 Well, hey, let me just throw this out here,
00:50:21 because I think this is happening,
00:50:23 and I just think there's a little bit of talking about it.
00:50:25 Like, May just point just now, you know,
00:50:27 it's probably fine, I'm not trying to attack you.
00:50:29 So, like, give an eye, for example,
00:50:31 say that, like, okay, there's a problem with language,
00:50:33 and it's this, and then, like,
00:50:35 we say, like, okay, here's, like,
00:50:37 what we could consider, like, a better version.
00:50:39 So, for example, you know, this, like, telepathic communication,
00:50:41 where we can really articulate ourselves
00:50:43 and communicate, like, everything in a blame blast.
00:50:45 It's fictional, I get it.
00:50:47 And then, you guys, in response to that, say,
00:50:49 okay, but that has these additional flaws.
00:50:52 No, I'm not saying that it's not enough of an improvement.
00:50:54 Or it's not enough of an improvement.
00:50:56 I'm saying that it doesn't make any sense.
00:50:58 I don't think it circumvents the problem at all.
00:51:00 If you're gonna, if the point is there's a problem with language,
00:51:02 I agree, there's inherent problems with spoken language,
00:51:06 and there's limitations.
00:51:07 Would a brain blast be superior in some ways?
00:51:09 Sure.
00:51:11 Jimmy Neutron's got it down.
00:51:12 Does it still?
00:51:13 Brain blast is always superior.
00:51:14 Does it still have problems?
00:51:15 Wait, wait, wait, let Tom finish.
00:51:16 It's still, but there are still issues.
00:51:18 There are still issues, even with that.
00:51:20 Because, yeah.
00:51:21 Man, you've entered the same issue.
00:51:22 Tom, Tom, I 100%, Tom, I 100% agree.
00:51:25 Munchy, I think you are objective, okay.
00:51:27 No, Munch is right.
00:51:28 The specific point I made, for example,
00:51:30 about including, like, more context.
00:51:32 Like, for example, the fact that, like, the word racism, again,
00:51:35 you mean different things.
00:51:36 Yeah, but to go back to that example too, though,
00:51:38 is that even if everybody understood everyone's context,
00:51:43 not everybody agrees on the context.
00:51:45 So you're still not gonna have 100% understanding.
00:51:47 But Tom, debating the context, my argument,
00:51:50 is that is a more productive debate
00:51:52 than just using the wrong word.
00:51:54 Like, that's a step back.
00:51:55 And I would like to be that step forward,
00:51:57 where we're actually clashing on the ideas.
00:51:59 You can say that, like, that's useless.
00:52:01 I disagree.
00:52:02 I guess my problem is that, like,
00:52:04 that's an issue beyond language, right?
00:52:06 Because if you really wanted to solve that problem,
00:52:08 like, you could write an article,
00:52:10 and then you could have little hyperlinks
00:52:12 over all your hot-button words
00:52:13 and explain exactly what you mean by them,
00:52:15 and then people would understand what you mean by racism.
00:52:17 You just hover over racism,
00:52:18 little pop-up thing comes up.
00:52:20 This is what I mean.
00:52:21 Prejudice plus power.
00:52:22 And then, like, you can know that.
00:52:23 But what you're doing is you're offering
00:52:25 exactly what I'm offering,
00:52:26 like, a fix to this specific problem.
00:52:28 Sure.
00:52:29 But I don't...
00:52:30 It doesn't involve brain tubes.
00:52:31 I don't...
00:52:32 I just don't think that that's...
00:52:33 That's just a joke.
00:52:34 I don't think that's inherently a problem
00:52:35 with language in and of itself.
00:52:36 Like, it's a limitation,
00:52:37 but, like, it can be addressed.
00:52:38 I just think that...
00:52:39 Oh, it's a limitation,
00:52:40 but not a problem, is it?
00:52:41 Oh, I see.
00:52:42 I see how it is.
00:52:43 Yeah.
00:52:44 Because even if you were able to address this
00:52:46 with, like, psychic communication,
00:52:48 automatically know everyone's context behind it,
00:52:50 like, people still aren't going to agree.
00:52:53 The problem lies within the human mind.
00:52:55 Is the problem this?
00:52:56 Is the problem this?
00:52:57 We're calling it a problem.
00:52:58 You called a limitation.
00:53:00 Is the problem just that one has a negative label
00:53:02 and the other has, like, a neutral?
00:53:04 No, no, Nate, listen.
00:53:05 The problem lies within the humans,
00:53:07 not within the language.
00:53:09 I mean, I disagree for all the reasons
00:53:10 I've already stated.
00:53:11 I think that language is inherently limited.
00:53:13 I don't disagree that language has problems, by the way.
00:53:16 Well, that's my point, though.
00:53:18 But no, you said language is bad.
00:53:20 But I mean, I've walked that back.
00:53:22 It is not bad.
00:53:23 It is way better than having no language.
00:53:25 And so, like, you win.
00:53:27 Language is not bad.
00:53:28 My point is just that it's not perfect.
00:53:30 And maybe I'm wrong.
00:53:31 I never said that it was perfect.
00:53:33 There we go.
00:53:34 Done.
00:53:35 Humans are flawed creatures, and they, you know,
00:53:40 it's okay to blame the humans for misusing words.
00:53:44 But I feel like, like I said earlier,
00:53:48 the usage, the point of language is to communicate ideas,
00:53:52 and it doesn't work on such a large scale
00:53:54 as it is in today's age of the internet
00:53:57 and everybody being connected.
00:53:59 Does anybody have, like, an issue with that statement?
00:54:03 I think the internet, as a whole,
00:54:05 proves that language is doing a damn good job.
00:54:07 I mean, the only, I, the only,
00:54:09 it's not even a rebuttal to that game.
00:54:11 It's just that, like, that is a consequence,
00:54:13 just sort of of, like, as more people
00:54:15 from different backgrounds and areas
00:54:17 came in contact with each other.
00:54:19 That was, you know, that was just going to arise
00:54:21 as soon as that happened.
00:54:22 But, like, yeah, it's basically,
00:54:23 it's a more archaic form of communication.
00:54:25 Just the fact that we have multiple languages
00:54:27 is basically, like, an archaic thing
00:54:29 that it would sure be nice if we could, like,
00:54:31 get past that particular issue.
00:54:33 You know, I went to the springboard off that,
00:54:34 why the fuck haven't we gone, like,
00:54:36 Star Wars or Star Trek and have, like,
00:54:38 a universal basic everybody listens to?
00:54:40 I constantly think about that.
00:54:41 Like, Esperanto, why isn't Esperanto, like,
00:54:44 funded by everybody
00:54:46 and a requirement for all countries?
00:54:49 You know why?
00:54:50 You know why?
00:54:51 It's because people are tribal
00:54:52 and they like their history.
00:54:53 That's why.
00:54:54 There's no reason to not just have that
00:54:55 in addition to, like, it should be happening.
00:54:57 Fair point.
00:54:58 Also, people are lazy.
00:54:59 There should be a stripped-down,
00:55:00 very basic form of language
00:55:02 that everyone learns.
00:55:03 I'll tell you exactly why I would argue.
00:55:05 Like, the reason I wouldn't want to do it
00:55:07 is because English looks like it's doing
00:55:09 pretty well right now.
00:55:10 I'm just going to hold out hope
00:55:11 that English just wins
00:55:12 and everybody starts speaking English.
00:55:14 Therefore, I have to do as little work as possible.
00:55:16 I think a lot of people
00:55:17 probably hold up that hope.
00:55:18 That doesn't seem very
00:55:19 utilitarian.
00:55:20 Where are the structural issues
00:55:22 in language made?
00:55:23 Like, is there anything inherent
00:55:25 to language that makes it undesirable
00:55:27 or would just adding more words
00:55:29 and more syntax be accomplishing
00:55:31 what you want?
00:55:32 I think ultimately the problem with language
00:55:34 is that it is based on, like,
00:55:36 group consensus, as Gibbs said,
00:55:38 and just inherently as, like,
00:55:40 if we could theoretically impose some,
00:55:42 like, like, French, for example,
00:55:44 French is a language where there is an organization
00:55:46 in France that dictates what
00:55:48 words mean.
00:55:49 They have, like, a body that decides this.
00:55:51 So, in France, technically,
00:55:53 like, you know, they'll, like, write in stuff
00:55:55 of, like, the consensus just changes
00:55:56 and they incorporate skiddy,
00:55:57 scuba de bop.
00:55:58 That means, like, a skateboard.
00:55:59 It's just another word for skateboard.
00:56:00 Cool.
00:56:01 But, like, in that language,
00:56:04 you can't just make,
00:56:05 you cannot, like, change the definition
00:56:07 of a word.
00:56:08 Well, the problem is that's not enforceable.
00:56:10 Things will just change no matter what.
00:56:12 You can't even have an organizational body
00:56:14 impose from top down what words mean,
00:56:16 because they're just responding
00:56:18 to what people do in the world anyway.
00:56:20 Well, there you go, Nate.
00:56:21 It sounds like the languages reflect the cultures.
00:56:22 No one would even think to do that
00:56:24 for English because it's like,
00:56:25 okay, is London gonna decide?
00:56:27 You think you're gonna have any luck getting America?
00:56:29 This is all to my point,
00:56:30 that these are limitations of language, yeah.
00:56:32 But French, I mean,
00:56:34 I'm sure there's lots of French
00:56:36 places around the world,
00:56:37 but it's mostly France, right?
00:56:39 Isn't it?
00:56:40 Yes.
00:56:41 So, like, France is a big country.
00:56:43 Yeah.
00:56:44 There's a lot of places that speak French,
00:56:45 like in Africa.
00:56:46 There's different French dialects.
00:56:47 But what's your point?
00:56:48 What's your point, though?
00:56:49 The point is,
00:56:50 French can do shit like that
00:56:51 because it's a little bit more centralized.
00:56:53 English can't, you know,
00:56:55 other languages reflect their
00:56:57 geographical realities,
00:56:59 so I think those languages are perfectly fine
00:57:01 for those kinds of people.
00:57:03 I...
00:57:04 I...
00:57:05 Okay.
00:57:06 The racism problem.
00:57:08 Why can't we just say,
00:57:10 okay, racism...
00:57:11 People think racism
00:57:12 means two different things,
00:57:13 or maybe even multiple different things.
00:57:14 All you gotta do is just correct them.
00:57:15 So, let's...
00:57:16 Let's just add an adjective.
00:57:18 Oh, this is special racism,
00:57:19 special racism.
00:57:20 Like, are there...
00:57:21 No, because people with a...
00:57:22 Traditional racism.
00:57:23 People with a political agenda
00:57:24 don't want to do that
00:57:25 because they want to manipulate the masses.
00:57:27 That is true.
00:57:28 That is true.
00:57:29 Like, when you...
00:57:30 When, like, somebody says,
00:57:31 that was racist.
00:57:32 Or, like, just for example,
00:57:34 if, like...
00:57:35 This is just a crazy example,
00:57:36 but, like, if a minority, like,
00:57:38 kills a white person,
00:57:39 they say that's not a hate crime
00:57:40 because it wasn't motivated by race.
00:57:42 Like, even if the person said,
00:57:43 like, let's say this person said,
00:57:44 I'm killing this white person
00:57:45 because they're white,
00:57:46 that's why I'm doing it.
00:57:47 Like, like, the new definition
00:57:49 can make a case that that wasn't a racist
00:57:51 and wasn't a hate crime
00:57:53 because, in their definition,
00:57:55 it's...
00:57:56 You can only be racist
00:57:57 if you lack social...
00:57:58 Here's my fucking thing.
00:57:59 Yeah, if you lack social power.
00:58:00 Here's my fucking thing.
00:58:01 With the confusion of words,
00:58:02 here's why the confusion of words
00:58:03 is natural and good
00:58:04 and should be embraced.
00:58:05 People...
00:58:06 What you're doing, Nate,
00:58:07 is you're doing the fallacy
00:58:08 to reframe what I said earlier,
00:58:09 the fallacy of wanting to have
00:58:11 permanent simplifications.
00:58:13 What I want is interesting conversations.
00:58:15 How is it...
00:58:16 What is the fallacy?
00:58:17 There are...
00:58:18 It's not, I guess, a fallacy...
00:58:19 It's not like a logical fallacy,
00:58:20 but it's a...
00:58:21 What would you call it?
00:58:22 A fool's errand
00:58:23 to try to find some sort of formula.
00:58:24 Okay, sure.
00:58:25 And I know it's a fallacy
00:58:26 that programmers,
00:58:27 especially fallen to all the time,
00:58:28 they want to, like,
00:58:29 come up with some sort of formula
00:58:30 that just takes the edge off.
00:58:32 And that's what people want
00:58:33 with, like, communication.
00:58:34 Oh, if we just have this
00:58:35 perfect formula.
00:58:36 No, no.
00:58:37 I'm finishing this point.
00:58:38 So, that's the reason
00:58:39 why these podcasts
00:58:40 always derail into these
00:58:41 technical conversations,
00:58:42 because we're trying to, like,
00:58:43 find the perfect, like, formulation
00:58:45 of the exact definition.
00:58:46 Whereas if we just let
00:58:47 the confusion reign
00:58:48 and just, like,
00:58:49 iron out little kinks
00:58:50 as we want,
00:58:51 then the podcast will be better.
00:58:53 And if you let conversations
00:58:54 and different disagreements,
00:58:55 like what racism means,
00:58:56 means you can always make
00:58:58 communicating your definition
00:58:59 of racism part of the conversation.
00:59:01 It gives you something
00:59:02 to fucking talk about
00:59:03 and makes the conversation
00:59:04 a little bit less inane.
00:59:05 It's a waste of time.
00:59:06 And if you know exactly
00:59:07 how to rebut
00:59:08 every version of the
00:59:09 wrong version of racism,
00:59:10 you can already have
00:59:11 your prescripted rebuttals
00:59:13 ready to go,
00:59:14 won't even take any effort.
00:59:15 That's not true.
00:59:16 The thing is to prove,
00:59:17 in this very podcast,
00:59:18 I have seen people
00:59:19 bring up things that Nate
00:59:20 has gone back on.
00:59:21 Um,
00:59:22 like, maybe they,
00:59:23 like what?
00:59:24 They didn't,
00:59:25 they forgot about it.
00:59:26 Like, like, like,
00:59:27 you saying language sucks.
00:59:28 Like, we only said that
00:59:29 right at the very beginning.
00:59:30 That's the one thing
00:59:31 I went back on.
00:59:32 And, but, like,
00:59:33 that has, like,
00:59:34 colored the perceptions
00:59:35 of everyone.
00:59:36 And, and they, they,
00:59:37 they hang,
00:59:38 they, they hung on to that
00:59:40 to, to, to bring it up
00:59:41 and like,
00:59:42 well, I'm framing this
00:59:43 from this perspective
00:59:44 that you have now gone back
00:59:45 on, but I forgot,
00:59:46 or like I didn't listen,
00:59:47 or I wasn't really
00:59:48 thinking about it.
00:59:49 It's just Nate is still
00:59:50 on this whole,
00:59:51 Nate, you're still on this
00:59:52 whole case of like,
00:59:53 fucking, uh, well,
00:59:54 you know,
00:59:55 language isn't like perfect,
00:59:56 but it's not like bad,
00:59:57 but it's not like perfect.
00:59:58 Like, I don't care.
00:59:59 Got him.
01:00:00 Well, for somebody
01:00:01 like, oh, oh,
01:00:03 got him.
01:00:04 Oh, I don't see me
01:00:05 dabbing right now.
01:00:06 I don't know who's been
01:00:07 got here.
01:00:08 The one thing that I,
01:00:09 I feel like is like,
01:00:10 it's kind of like
01:00:11 lawyering.
01:00:12 It's kind of like the
01:00:13 law, the justice system
01:00:14 and laws and lawyers,
01:00:15 where the,
01:00:16 the point of,
01:00:17 like using,
01:00:18 co-opting a word
01:00:19 and making it,
01:00:20 have a different definition
01:00:21 to, to push a
01:00:22 political agenda is,
01:00:24 um,
01:00:25 like just like how law
01:00:27 is written to be
01:00:28 incredibly confusing
01:00:29 so that poor people
01:00:30 can't figure it out
01:00:31 and they have to pay
01:00:32 a really expensive guy
01:00:33 to translate it for them.
01:00:35 Sure.
01:00:36 And, um,
01:00:37 this is,
01:00:38 this is a really nasty thing
01:00:39 and I don't like it.
01:00:40 These are,
01:00:41 these are trans issues.
01:00:42 The fact that someone has to
01:00:43 translate, I get it.
01:00:44 Oh, well.
01:00:45 And it's,
01:00:46 and it's,
01:00:47 it's just sort of like,
01:00:48 people don't have,
01:00:50 like,
01:00:51 say a word is changed,
01:00:52 like 50 words are changed
01:00:53 and somebody just
01:00:54 wasn't paying attention
01:00:55 because they don't use
01:00:56 those words often.
01:00:57 And then they see,
01:00:58 they read a thing
01:00:59 and they're like,
01:01:00 they're really confused,
01:01:01 but they don't have
01:01:02 like the time
01:01:03 or like they're too,
01:01:04 they just don't,
01:01:05 it doesn't come up enough
01:01:06 in their life
01:01:07 to think about
01:01:08 all the different things
01:01:09 that are going on
01:01:10 and keep track of all of them.
01:01:11 They probably have to pay
01:01:12 a guy to,
01:01:13 to, to give them
01:01:14 like an update every so often
01:01:15 like an app on their phone
01:01:16 to like,
01:01:17 all right, here's what this
01:01:18 word means now.
01:01:19 You got all the books
01:01:20 that in the,
01:01:21 in the past,
01:01:22 now you know why they're
01:01:23 so confusing.
01:01:24 And it's like,
01:01:25 it's just,
01:01:26 it's just,
01:01:27 I don't like it.
01:01:28 I don't have an answer.
01:01:29 I know why we can't do
01:01:30 that thing with racism.
01:01:31 I know why we can't
01:01:32 like just be like,
01:01:33 okay, well now there's
01:01:34 two different racisms.
01:01:35 It's because that,
01:01:36 it's because unlike,
01:01:37 unlike the French,
01:01:38 those rat bastards,
01:01:40 we don't,
01:01:41 we don't have like a council
01:01:42 that decides what words mean.
01:01:44 Words mean whatever we say
01:01:46 they mean.
01:01:47 Words mean whatever
01:01:48 we collectively agree
01:01:49 that they mean.
01:01:50 And, and that's why,
01:01:51 there's a disagreement
01:01:52 unfortunately.
01:01:53 There is a,
01:01:54 there is a disagreement,
01:01:55 but there's no authority
01:01:56 that can step in
01:01:57 and say like,
01:01:58 well, here's what it actually means.
01:01:59 Yeah.
01:02:00 That's the biggest problem.
01:02:01 But, but new words
01:02:02 have been made before.
01:02:03 There have been new words made.
01:02:05 So can't we do that?
01:02:06 Well,
01:02:07 but they weren't,
01:02:08 but they weren't like,
01:02:09 to be used by everybody
01:02:10 is really difficult.
01:02:11 They weren't passed down
01:02:12 from on high.
01:02:13 They were like,
01:02:14 they, they like generated,
01:02:16 I mean,
01:02:17 except maybe in certain cases
01:02:18 they were generated
01:02:19 out of the ether.
01:02:20 And like,
01:02:21 and like a grassroots kind
01:02:22 of campaign could like,
01:02:23 you know,
01:02:24 campaign for a new word
01:02:25 or something.
01:02:26 You know,
01:02:27 you know,
01:02:28 remember there's a book called
01:02:29 frindle.
01:02:30 Remember that book,
01:02:31 frindle?
01:02:32 I never read it.
01:02:33 Do you remember that book,
01:02:34 the Hobbit?
01:02:35 Do you remember that book,
01:02:36 the Bible?
01:02:37 No,
01:02:38 no,
01:02:39 it's an actual point.
01:02:40 Okay.
01:02:41 J.R.R.
01:02:42 Tolkien created a language
01:02:43 of Elvish.
01:02:44 He created a whole language
01:02:45 of Elvish
01:02:46 that people can study
01:02:47 and it's like really funny
01:02:48 and they can pretend
01:02:49 to be elves
01:02:50 and they can speak
01:02:51 with Elvish
01:02:52 and it's all really funny
01:02:53 and cool.
01:02:54 And the reason that language
01:02:55 will never change
01:02:56 is because people don't want
01:02:57 to be non-canon.
01:02:58 They don't want to be like
01:02:59 that guy.
01:03:00 So they will always stay
01:03:01 to the canon language.
01:03:02 So there is an authority.
01:03:03 So Elvish will never devolve
01:03:05 into something like,
01:03:06 there will never be Elvish
01:03:07 like,
01:03:08 slang.
01:03:09 I don't know, slang.
01:03:10 Yeah.
01:03:11 I mean,
01:03:12 you could have your head cannons
01:03:13 and stuff,
01:03:14 but no one really want,
01:03:15 people who are into that
01:03:16 don't really want to do that.
01:03:17 And I like that.
01:03:18 I just enjoy the fact
01:03:19 that that can exist
01:03:20 and authority
01:03:21 that people all agree on,
01:03:22 like yes,
01:03:23 we'll stick to this.
01:03:24 We talk in Elvish,
01:03:25 we know exactly what the other
01:03:26 person is saying all the time.
01:03:27 In fact,
01:03:28 everyone should speak in Elvish.
01:03:29 It's really funny.
01:03:30 Actually,
01:03:31 if we start using it,
01:03:32 we'll just face the same problems
01:03:33 we have with English now.
01:03:34 Yeah, no, no.
01:03:35 Hippo, hippo, hippo, hippo.
01:03:36 Secret, secret, secret club,
01:03:37 like little brother languages
01:03:40 where you're like,
01:03:41 instead of saying,
01:03:42 hello, I'm going to say,
01:03:43 go, go, go, go.
01:03:44 And,
01:03:45 you know,
01:03:46 secret languages like that
01:03:47 between two people
01:03:48 are the tightest form
01:03:49 of communication.
01:03:50 I always prefer that
01:03:51 to like speaking real.
01:03:52 So the reason why Elvish doesn't change
01:03:54 isn't because of like fandoms.
01:03:56 I think we have experience enough
01:03:58 with fandoms to know
01:03:59 they missed the point of the work.
01:04:01 It's the fact that no one
01:04:02 is a like resident of Elfland, right?
01:04:06 So like no one fucking is actively,
01:04:08 like it's not their primary language.
01:04:09 No one like lives a society of Elvish.
01:04:11 You only do it in the form of studying.
01:04:12 There's no people to evolve with.
01:04:14 Right.
01:04:15 So I think the reason
01:04:16 why Elvish doesn't change
01:04:17 is for the same reason
01:04:18 like I guess Greek
01:04:19 probably doesn't change anymore
01:04:20 because no one actually
01:04:21 like uses it like a real language.
01:04:22 They just use it
01:04:23 as a thing they've studied.
01:04:24 Besides the country of Greece.
01:04:25 The Greeks do.
01:04:26 Oh, the Latin world country of Greece.
01:04:28 Latin is a dead language.
01:04:30 Latin.
01:04:31 There we go.
01:04:32 Yeah.
01:04:33 That one.
01:04:34 That fucking one.
01:04:35 Yeah.
01:04:36 Let's all speak Latin.
01:04:37 That's an issue with language
01:04:38 that's brought up.
01:04:39 How, you know,
01:04:40 the Bibles ran exclusively
01:04:41 in land in the olden days.
01:04:42 And so the poor,
01:04:43 you know,
01:04:44 the poor baby bitch fuckers
01:04:45 couldn't actually read the Bible.
01:04:46 They didn't know what the fuck
01:04:47 was going on.
01:04:48 That's a problem.
01:04:49 Used to subjugate people.
01:04:50 I did it.
01:04:51 I'm the anti-language person.
01:04:52 Okay.
01:04:53 I have a statement
01:04:54 and I want to see
01:04:55 if everyone agrees.
01:04:56 Okay.
01:04:57 We have language.
01:04:58 It's not perfect.
01:04:59 False.
01:05:00 No, no.
01:05:01 We have language.
01:05:03 It's not perfect.
01:05:04 If there were better
01:05:05 alternatives,
01:05:06 that would be nice.
01:05:07 But there aren't any.
01:05:08 So what we currently have
01:05:09 is better than nothing.
01:05:12 Yeah.
01:05:13 Agree.
01:05:14 Well, I think Nate
01:05:15 was like going on this
01:05:16 like maybe they could
01:05:17 like could we work
01:05:18 towards like stuff
01:05:19 like we should start
01:05:20 working towards a better version.
01:05:21 Yeah.
01:05:22 That's part of my statement.
01:05:23 If there was a better version,
01:05:24 that would be nice.
01:05:25 Oh, actually,
01:05:26 I do know a thing about this.
01:05:27 I remember reading like an article.
01:05:28 I read the actual article.
01:05:29 Well, okay.
01:05:30 I skimmed it.
01:05:31 And it was about how like,
01:05:32 oh man, wouldn't it be cool
01:05:33 if we instead of like
01:05:34 all these really messy languages
01:05:35 with all these inconsistencies,
01:05:36 you know,
01:05:37 even if you go to like,
01:05:38 you know,
01:05:39 Japanese or Korean
01:05:40 where it's like,
01:05:41 hey, there's no pronunciation
01:05:42 bullshit.
01:05:43 Then it's like, oh, you know,
01:05:44 Japanese,
01:05:45 here's all this kanji bullshit,
01:05:46 right?
01:05:47 So it's like,
01:05:48 it's like technical and accurate
01:05:49 and clean with no bullshit.
01:05:51 And someone like did a study
01:05:52 of this.
01:05:53 They like had like computers
01:05:54 algorithmically like generate
01:05:56 some languages
01:05:57 and it had people like practice
01:05:58 with them.
01:05:59 The point is what they found
01:06:00 and I don't know how tested
01:06:01 this was yet,
01:06:02 but humans actually only
01:06:04 really get a grip on
01:06:06 bullshit languages
01:06:07 because our brains are
01:06:08 themselves a bullshit
01:06:09 mishmash-pishposh
01:06:10 of billions of years of evolution.
01:06:12 So like,
01:06:13 we don't actually
01:06:14 ever think as cleanly
01:06:15 as robots ever will
01:06:17 because we're just a fucking mess.
01:06:19 We're a fucking mess
01:06:20 genetically.
01:06:21 You know what the future is?
01:06:23 The future is like Isaac Asimov
01:06:24 where all the kids
01:06:25 don't learn English,
01:06:26 they just learn programming
01:06:27 language and everyone has
01:06:28 a programming job
01:06:29 because that's the only thing
01:06:30 humans are useful for.
01:06:31 Eventually that one
01:06:32 is being useful.
01:06:33 They maintain all the robots.
01:06:34 That's sad.
01:06:35 A lot of robots be able to do
01:06:36 that before too long too.
01:06:37 It was really sad when I first
01:06:38 read it,
01:06:39 but I kind of,
01:06:40 I think it's kind of cool
01:06:41 how that guy that from so long
01:06:42 ago had that idea.
01:06:43 Yeah, but I like
01:06:44 language because
01:06:46 I'm specifically English
01:06:47 because of how silly it can get.
01:06:49 I like the stupid,
01:06:50 oh whoa,
01:06:51 and verb,
01:06:52 and doggo,
01:06:53 and shit like that.
01:06:54 I love it.
01:06:55 It's great.
01:06:57 It'd be sad to see it go.
01:06:59 Yeah.
01:07:00 This will be an extremely
01:07:01 unpopular opinion,
01:07:02 and I will be,
01:07:04 I'll,
01:07:05 no, go for it.
01:07:06 Language.
01:07:07 Sorry, I was stretching
01:07:08 while talking.
01:07:09 I'll be berated
01:07:10 both in the comments
01:07:11 and right now.
01:07:13 But isn't the sort
01:07:15 of uncertainty of language
01:07:16 kind of romantic?
01:07:18 Isn't it kind of neat to be able
01:07:20 to write down something
01:07:21 that's awful,
01:07:22 how to be interpreted
01:07:23 in different ways?
01:07:24 That's like why.
01:07:25 I think it's good for like
01:07:26 having a friend
01:07:27 and chumming out
01:07:28 and like making a funny joke.
01:07:29 Yeah.
01:07:30 But when it comes to politics,
01:07:31 I feel like people should
01:07:32 talk in bleeps and bloops.
01:07:33 It gives rise to like poetry
01:07:35 and puns
01:07:36 and,
01:07:37 you know,
01:07:38 cute shit like that.
01:07:39 I like that.
01:07:40 I'm probably willing
01:07:41 to accept the artistic
01:07:42 narrative language.
01:07:43 Yeah, I mean,
01:07:44 it's,
01:07:45 language is both an art
01:07:46 and a science depending
01:07:47 on how it's being used.
01:07:48 Mm-hmm.
01:07:49 It's funny though,
01:07:50 like if we're used to it
01:07:51 like this,
01:07:52 like things that are serious
01:07:53 being used with words
01:07:54 that can also be used
01:07:55 to make art.
01:07:56 But like,
01:07:57 imagine if like politics
01:07:59 was done with drawings
01:08:01 instead of,
01:08:02 you know.
01:08:03 Sorry,
01:08:04 just imagine
01:08:05 politicians finger-painting.
01:08:06 Yes,
01:08:07 if finger-painting,
01:08:08 having the deviant art
01:08:09 being used
01:08:10 instead of like Donald Trump's
01:08:11 Twitter,
01:08:12 it would be like,
01:08:13 Donald Trump's made another
01:08:14 mural.
01:08:15 Trump's made another mural,
01:08:16 everyone,
01:08:17 check it out.
01:08:18 That's why he wants
01:08:19 to make the wall
01:08:20 so he can put his
01:08:21 mural somewhere.
01:08:22 Politics does
01:08:23 definitely need to be
01:08:24 a much more visual medium
01:08:25 than it is.
01:08:26 I remember back in like
01:08:27 2012,
01:08:28 like,
01:08:29 Mitt Romney was all like,
01:08:30 oh man,
01:08:31 there's been less oil drilling,
01:08:32 less American energy
01:08:33 than Obama.
01:08:34 I was like,
01:08:35 oh,
01:08:36 it was actually 45% up
01:08:37 the previous.
01:08:38 No,
01:08:39 it was like 25% down
01:08:40 the previous year
01:08:41 of the government grants.
01:08:42 All right, guys,
01:08:43 you bitches need to
01:08:44 have a fucking easel
01:08:45 and show us some fucking
01:08:46 charts, please.
01:08:47 I can't hold all these
01:08:48 words in my head at once.
01:08:49 Here's where
01:08:50 I will spiral into
01:08:51 absolute madness
01:08:52 that I deserve to be
01:08:53 criticized for.
01:08:54 But it's like,
01:08:55 beyond language,
01:08:56 I get frustrated
01:08:57 with facts.
01:08:58 Yeah.
01:08:59 It's in the sense that
01:09:00 I've had enough of these
01:09:01 facts.
01:09:02 I've had enough of
01:09:03 these facts.
01:09:04 But the problem is,
01:09:05 just like with language.
01:09:06 Yeah, I know,
01:09:07 I know exactly what you're
01:09:08 talking about.
01:09:09 With this Mitt Romney
01:09:10 example,
01:09:11 who knows,
01:09:12 who's like,
01:09:13 when Mitt Romney said a fact,
01:09:14 I'm sure that fact
01:09:15 was true.
01:09:16 Then Obama
01:09:17 raises more facts
01:09:18 that contextualize,
01:09:19 but it is entirely possible
01:09:21 that there are yet facts
01:09:22 beyond that
01:09:23 further contextualize.
01:09:24 Oh,
01:09:25 that's why I don't
01:09:26 research things.
01:09:27 You know,
01:09:28 it's just like,
01:09:29 you know what,
01:09:30 how,
01:09:31 what are we expected to do?
01:09:32 That's why,
01:09:33 like I want to know
01:09:34 literally every fact
01:09:35 to make an opinion.
01:09:36 You're talking about
01:09:37 cherry picking facts,
01:09:38 where you present
01:09:39 a fact that sounds good
01:09:40 without it's a broader
01:09:41 context to give it more meaning.
01:09:42 I mean, the problem is,
01:09:43 the problem is to me,
01:09:44 like you've got
01:09:45 guys on like the
01:09:46 left wing and the right wing.
01:09:47 And like,
01:09:48 if you just see a fact
01:09:49 tweeted by like whatever,
01:09:50 you know,
01:09:51 a journalist or whatever
01:09:52 that's like in your team,
01:09:53 you can read that.
01:09:54 Then the opposition will say,
01:09:55 well,
01:09:56 you didn't contextualize it,
01:09:57 blah, blah, blah.
01:09:58 But then,
01:09:59 and then like a person
01:10:00 by doing this like first
01:10:01 level fact check
01:10:02 will feel satisfied,
01:10:03 but it's entirely possible
01:10:04 that there's an infinite
01:10:05 spiral of yet further
01:10:06 fact checkings
01:10:07 that need to happen.
01:10:08 That's because life is complicated.
01:10:09 And if you want to be informed,
01:10:10 you have to be the guy
01:10:11 that's like,
01:10:12 I guess I'm just gonna
01:10:13 have to do a deep dive
01:10:14 on every tweet
01:10:15 ever tweeted.
01:10:16 Yeah, that's right.
01:10:17 Yeah, you really do.
01:10:18 Like you have to basically
01:10:19 like check up facts
01:10:20 as a lifestyle
01:10:21 to where you get
01:10:22 an intuitive sense of it.
01:10:23 That's the only way to do it.
01:10:24 That really is.
01:10:25 And you know guys,
01:10:26 no one does it.
01:10:27 This is,
01:10:28 I mean,
01:10:29 it's similar to just
01:10:30 my personal frustration.
01:10:31 You know,
01:10:32 you can feel free to
01:10:33 disagree as you have,
01:10:34 but it's just like,
01:10:35 that's why when someone
01:10:36 like says a sentence,
01:10:37 like that,
01:10:38 I feel like make a tweet.
01:10:39 Like I feel frustration with this.
01:10:40 Like I can try to make it
01:10:42 seem like what I want it to.
01:10:43 And I know that
01:10:44 like Twitter is limited
01:10:45 as opposed to like
01:10:46 writing a blog post or whatever.
01:10:47 But it's just like,
01:10:48 I just want to communicate
01:10:49 literally every fact
01:10:51 about this thing
01:10:52 I'm trying to say.
01:10:53 And I feel a deep frustration
01:10:55 that it's so hard to do that.
01:10:56 And you know,
01:10:57 I know language is
01:10:58 a ton of great stuff.
01:10:59 But I just,
01:11:00 oh, it kills me.
01:11:01 Kiss myself.
01:11:02 But it's like,
01:11:03 oh no, no, you don't understand.
01:11:04 Like I was actually
01:11:05 at the urinal
01:11:06 and there were just a couple of drops.
01:11:07 I was like,
01:11:08 I'm not a real guy.
01:11:09 Like technically,
01:11:10 yes, I did piss myself.
01:11:11 And also I was spooked
01:11:12 by a clown.
01:11:13 So it wasn't even my fault.
01:11:14 Like this is,
01:11:15 there's yet further context
01:11:16 beyond this.
01:11:17 And we can go all day.
01:11:18 And I was at a clown rodeo
01:11:19 as a matter of fact.
01:11:20 So like,
01:11:21 maybe I should have been prepared.
01:11:22 So maybe I'm actually
01:11:23 in the wrong here.
01:11:24 You know, we can go all day.
01:11:25 The problem with language
01:11:26 is like the problem
01:11:27 with all things,
01:11:28 clowns over the abundance of clowns
01:11:30 makes us all piss ourselves
01:11:31 and languages ruined forever
01:11:33 at the site of one jug alone.
01:11:36 Yeah.
01:11:38 Well, I'm glad
01:11:40 we went through with this exercise.
01:11:42 I guess,
01:11:43 do we have final points here?
01:11:44 You want to wrap up here?
01:11:45 What language do you guys want to learn?
01:11:46 I want to learn,
01:11:47 I like English.
01:11:48 I want to learn American sign language.
01:11:50 I want to learn Arabic.
01:11:52 I think that would be really funny.
01:11:53 More like Arabic.
01:11:54 Arabic looks really nice.
01:11:56 I like Arabic.
01:11:57 I like the way it's all swishy and swishy.
01:11:59 It looks intimidating to learn.
01:12:01 Yeah.
01:12:02 It probably isn't.
01:12:05 That's from the early,
01:12:07 that part of the world
01:12:08 is where the first languages
01:12:09 even came out of the ground.
01:12:12 I want to give...
01:12:13 I mean,
01:12:14 the Arabic numbering system was pretty good,
01:12:16 so I'd hope their actual language holds up.
01:12:18 Is that what we use?
01:12:19 Yes.
01:12:20 One, two, three, four, five.
01:12:21 That's right.
01:12:22 Way to go, guys.
01:12:23 Didn't they invent the zero over there, too?
01:12:26 I think it was India, actually.
01:12:28 I think it was zero.
01:12:29 Oh, okay.
01:12:30 Some fucked up freak.
01:12:33 As I'm sure everyone knows,
01:12:34 I wish to continue learning Japanese
01:12:37 specifically for just practical
01:12:38 and artistic reasons,
01:12:39 because I think it's cool.
01:12:40 Yeah, same here, Nate.
01:12:41 I just want to be able to listen to anime
01:12:44 while I'm doing the other shit.
01:12:45 Same.
01:12:46 That would be great.
01:12:47 I also want to learn Esperanto
01:12:49 for some of the reasons we talked about here.
01:12:51 Having that universal language,
01:12:52 I think everyone should learn it.
01:12:54 Everyone should learn it.
01:12:56 It'd be great.
01:12:57 I dab on dubs.
01:12:59 That's what I have to say to that.
01:13:00 Ben, you didn't talk about how cool
01:13:02 big words are with me.
01:13:04 Oh, wait.
01:13:05 I thought you were saying
01:13:06 that you liked the rare words,
01:13:07 because I prefer a rare word to a big word.
01:13:10 Well, okay.
01:13:11 I agree that rare words are better,
01:13:14 but big words are also nice.
01:13:16 I feel like most of the time,
01:13:17 they're in tandem.
01:13:18 Like, most of the time,
01:13:19 the reason words are rare
01:13:20 is because they're big
01:13:21 and no one wants to say them.
01:13:22 Yeah.
01:13:23 You like flexing your vocabulary
01:13:24 every now and then, you know?
01:13:25 Exactly.
01:13:26 Exactly.
01:13:27 I love it.
01:13:28 There's nothing wrong with flexing,
01:13:30 but I think better than using
01:13:33 a big word or a rare word.
01:13:34 The best thing is when you need,
01:13:37 like, an unusual word
01:13:39 to express something nuanced,
01:13:41 and then you fucking have it,
01:13:42 and you pull it out at just the right second.
01:13:44 Sure.
01:13:45 And you express something so nuanced
01:13:48 and so subtle
01:13:50 that everyone is just blown away by it.
01:13:53 Your vocabulary is fucking awesome right now.
01:13:55 That is satisfying.
01:13:57 Vocabulary is great.
01:13:58 Back in, like, sixth grade,
01:14:00 there was, like, a vocabulary word of the day,
01:14:02 and, you know, you would teach you shit like
01:14:04 fey or, you know, whatever the hell,
01:14:06 basic bitch shit.
01:14:07 I wish there was just, like,
01:14:08 was mage toward it.
01:14:09 Mage, there was an opening.
01:14:10 You can just jump in.
01:14:11 Just jump in there, mage.
01:14:12 Go.
01:14:13 What is it?
01:14:14 I said earlier,
01:14:15 what do you know what a sesbicodalian is?
01:14:17 No.
01:14:18 Equestria daily?
01:14:19 No, sesbicodalian.
01:14:21 Sesclid.
01:14:22 I do not.
01:14:23 Your vocabulary eclipses.
01:14:24 Is that a flower?
01:14:25 No.
01:14:26 Dalian.
01:14:27 Dalian.
01:14:28 What is it?
01:14:29 Well, look it up.
01:14:31 I don't know how to spell that.
01:14:32 I don't know how to spell that.
01:14:34 Well, anyway, I'm saying that there should be
01:14:36 vocabulary words of the day for everyone, forever.
01:14:38 E-S-Q-U-I-P-E-D-A-L-A-N.
01:14:42 It means gay.
01:14:44 No.
01:14:45 Mages calling us all gay.
01:14:47 No.
01:14:48 How rude.
01:14:49 No.
01:14:50 I called you weenies at the beginning.
01:14:51 Sesquidalian.
01:14:52 Spelled F-A-G-G-O-T.
01:14:54 Look it up, everybody.
01:14:55 Oh, no.
01:14:56 You might enjoy that.
01:14:57 No.
01:14:58 Hey, Nick, can you spell A-G-O-T real quick?
01:14:59 I'm doing an exam.
01:15:00 I'm doing a spelling test right now,
01:15:01 and I was wondering if you could try to figure it out.
01:15:04 I don't want to be bullied.
01:15:06 I won't do it.
01:15:07 I won't suffer.
01:15:09 Vocabulary is good, kids.
01:15:11 Check it out someday.
01:15:12 Words are cool.
01:15:13 Words are cool.
01:15:14 Hey, have I talked about this before?
01:15:16 I think this is the time.
01:15:18 There's a part in the book, The Plague,
01:15:20 by Albert Camus,
01:15:22 where the main character,
01:15:25 he goes to like hang out with this guy that he knows.
01:15:28 And the guy kind of,
01:15:30 they kind of open up and become a little friendly.
01:15:33 And the guy finally decides to share with him
01:15:36 this thing that he's been working on,
01:15:38 that he kind of doesn't usually talk about,
01:15:40 but he's like, okay, I'll show you.
01:15:41 I'll show you, because you're my buddy.
01:15:43 And he brings it out.
01:15:45 And what it is,
01:15:46 is this thing that he's been working on for like years,
01:15:48 is he has been polishing one sentence
01:15:51 to be the ultimate sentence,
01:15:53 like the most beautifully poetic sentence
01:15:56 in the French language.
01:15:58 And it's, um...
01:15:59 Your mom gay.
01:16:01 Le Danque means...
01:16:02 Okay, well, he...
01:16:03 Like, he revises it a couple of times,
01:16:05 so I'm not sure if this is the original,
01:16:07 but it doesn't matter.
01:16:08 The sentence is, more or less,
01:16:11 one fine morning in May,
01:16:13 a slim young horsewoman might have been seen
01:16:15 riding a glossy sorrel mare
01:16:17 along the flower-strewn avenues of the Bouda Bouillon.
01:16:20 Aw, that's pretty good.
01:16:21 That sounds pretty good.
01:16:22 I like his sorrel.
01:16:23 Yeah, I liked it.
01:16:24 So he did it.
01:16:25 The sort of horse-boy-fucking-horse?
01:16:27 What's with the horse-boys?
01:16:28 And he says that one day, when it's perfect,
01:16:30 he'll bring it to the publishing house,
01:16:31 and he'll show it to them.
01:16:32 And everyone on all the publishers
01:16:34 will stand up and say, gentlemen, hats off.
01:16:37 Hats off!
01:16:43 It's like that family guy bit.
01:16:45 It's like the best joke ever,
01:16:47 which is, guess what?
01:16:48 Chicken butt.
01:16:49 That's it.
01:16:50 Perfect joke.
01:16:51 You know, a family guy is basically
01:16:53 a modern-day Albert Camus, I think.
01:16:56 Here's Languages Fatal Flaw.
01:16:58 The word nautical does not mean radical.
01:17:01 Nautical, by all rights, by its birthright,
01:17:05 deserves to be a cinnamon for, like,
01:17:08 sick or con-
01:17:09 A cinnamon?
01:17:10 A cinnamon, you say?
01:17:11 How delectable.
01:17:12 A cinnamon.
01:17:13 It deserves to be like, dude,
01:17:15 that's fucking nautical, bro.
01:17:16 Yeah, dude, fucking it.
01:17:18 Shouldn't it be the opposite of radical?
01:17:21 Like, you can be radical, or you can be nautical?
01:17:23 Nautical, yeah.
01:17:24 No, no, I think...
01:17:25 I mean, that's good, but I think it should be, like,
01:17:27 reserved for when we invent underwater skateboarding.
01:17:30 No, that's coming up real quick.
01:17:33 Like, not surfboarding, underwater skateboarding.
01:17:36 Like, with really heavy wheels.
01:17:38 Yeah.
01:17:39 Imagine grinding upon the Great Barrier Reef
01:17:41 right into a shark.
01:17:42 You had that really heavy shoes, too.
01:17:44 The Great Barrier Reef is, like, gone now, right?
01:17:47 That's completely dead.
01:17:48 That's just because of all the grinding of the
01:17:49 so many skateboarding people are doing.
01:17:52 We need to stop.
01:17:53 Sick.
01:17:54 Grinding.
01:17:55 Why don't we...
01:17:56 I feel like we're Peter and Adher fan.
01:17:57 What do you think?
01:17:58 I think I'm ready to move on to the question.
01:17:59 I think we need to close out...
01:18:00 I actually...
01:18:01 We need to close out with teaching everybody a new word, right?
01:18:04 I just did.
01:18:05 I'll speak with Dalian.
01:18:06 You didn't tell us what it means, though.
01:18:08 Well, it's just anything.
01:18:09 It's homework.
01:18:10 That's cute and all, Mage,
01:18:11 but let's talk about a really important word
01:18:12 that Nate taught us before the podcast began.
01:18:15 It's Alexa.
01:18:16 Alexaed on everything.
01:18:17 Oh, yeah!
01:18:18 Alexaed, yeah.
01:18:19 Commanding a person like you would command
01:18:21 an Amazon Alexa.
01:18:22 Kid 1, mom, stop.
01:18:25 And mom did stop talking.
01:18:26 Kid 2, wow, mom.
01:18:28 He just Alexaed you.
01:18:30 Truly, language is evolving in a beautiful way.
01:18:32 That's my point.
01:18:33 Host about nuclear gaming.
01:18:35 Nuclear gaming.
01:18:36 You know that?
01:18:37 Also, there was a gif of Ed Sheeran under that definition.
01:18:41 I don't know why, but it was there.
01:18:43 And we all have to live with that.
01:18:46 Well, I feel Alexaed to getting to the goddamn Amazon.
01:18:51 I was planning.
01:18:52 I actually signed up onto this episode
01:18:54 so I could talk about free speech
01:18:56 and where people draw the line
01:18:58 between free speech and where you can have a...
01:19:00 And how it relates to words.
01:19:01 So, we'll save that for another episode.
01:19:03 Free speech, guys.
01:19:04 That'll be a PCP episode at some point.
01:19:06 That's a good idea.
01:19:07 I like doing that.
01:19:08 We should actually write that down.
01:19:09 Yeah, add it to the list.
01:19:11 I actually did it while Nate was going off
01:19:14 his five-hour inane, whether or not words are perfect.
01:19:17 Thank God something was done today.
01:19:19 You're just mad, because I'm literally Starfleet.
01:19:21 Look at me go.
01:19:22 Okay, go on, go on.
01:19:23 Guys, Magiskule.
01:19:24 Yeah, what's that?
01:19:25 That's the word I'm bringing to the table.
01:19:26 Magiskarp.
01:19:27 Try and figure it out.
01:19:28 Magiskule.
01:19:29 What do you think?
01:19:30 Magiskule.
01:19:31 It's like minuscule, only a magic version of being minuscule.
01:19:33 Very close.
01:19:34 It's the opposite of minuscule.
01:19:36 Instead of saying capital letters, you could say magiskule.
01:19:39 So, when are we going to get some magiskule reviews on Hippocrate?
01:19:43 That's fucking sick.
01:19:45 I should definitely do that now.
01:19:47 That's a great idea.
01:19:48 And what is something that's big, other than something that's small, that's magical?
01:19:51 Rayman2, everyone.
01:19:52 Rayman2 coming up next video.
01:19:54 Magiskule review.
01:19:56 Well gone, the Magiskule bus.
01:19:58 Nobody cares about Rayman2 except for you.
01:20:00 No!
01:20:01 It's Rayman2!
01:20:02 They're cheering!
01:20:03 They're cheering!
01:20:04 They're clamoring for Hippo outside of my window.
01:20:07 There's just a crowdful piece of Mandigrad.
01:20:10 I mean, Rayman2.
01:20:17 We're done.
01:20:18 We've had a lot of fun here today, but it's time to get serious.
01:20:22 Yeah, it's time to close.
01:20:24 Time to nut up or shut up.
01:20:26 Before we get to questions, me and you, Nate, have followed that we need to settle.
01:20:31 That's right, everybody.
01:20:32 If you listened to last week's episode, Munchie and I made a sacred pact where we both agreed
01:20:37 that we would be healthy boys in different ways and made some health resolutions.
01:20:42 So let's lay our cards on the table.
01:20:44 Munchie, what was your thing and how to go?
01:20:46 My resolution was that I would not drink a single carbonated drink
01:20:50 because I've been drinking too much energy drinks.
01:20:52 And I'm happy to announce that I have not drinking a single carbonated drink since that recording
01:20:57 until now.
01:20:59 Oh!
01:21:01 Look at Munchie go!
01:21:03 What a shame.
01:21:04 He's doing so well.
01:21:06 Well, you know what? There's nothing wrong with taking a cheat day, you know?
01:21:09 Or a cheat meal.
01:21:10 Wait, Munchie, how's it taste?
01:21:12 It feels so fucking good!
01:21:16 No, he's a lost cause.
01:21:19 So to check in, congratulations Munchie.
01:21:21 You've earned it. You've earned that.
01:21:23 So my thing was I swore off sugar.
01:21:26 And it's kind of hard to avoid sugar just forever.
01:21:29 So what I defined that as was I defined it like anything with additional sugar added to it.
01:21:34 Gee, I don't know if I agree with that definition of sugar.
01:21:37 I think we're going to have to have some psychically connected language here
01:21:42 to get to consensus on what sugar means.
01:21:44 Well, I mean, there is no consensus. I make the rules and this is what they wear.
01:21:48 To me, sugar is sexist language and I should say it.
01:21:53 So here's how it went. It went great until Thursday.
01:21:58 And here's what happened. Here's what happened.
01:22:01 I was at the grocery store. I was buying, you know, nutritious food with no sugar.
01:22:06 And I simply walked by. My mind was absent. My balls were empty.
01:22:11 And I walk by a free display giving away little donut pieces.
01:22:16 Oh, no!
01:22:18 Little cookie pieces. And I just don't even think.
01:22:21 I just say, oh, cool, free. And I take a piece and I eat it.
01:22:25 That capitalism just overwhelmed everything.
01:22:28 And then I take a cookie. There was these little cranberry cookies and I just eat that.
01:22:32 I continue on my way. Don't even think of it.
01:22:34 And then I realized like a fucking shock from God.
01:22:37 I realized what I have done.
01:22:38 I've done this before. It was the worst.
01:22:40 I almost did this too. It's funny that like you guys did like a diet thing
01:22:44 or like a good boy thing because I've been doing a good boy thing for the last week as well.
01:22:48 I've restarted doing intermittent fasting because I enjoy doing it a lot. Yes.
01:22:53 Aren't you skinny enough, dude?
01:22:55 No, no. I'm like 220 pounds, dude. It's disgusting.
01:22:59 220 pounds? Okay.
01:23:01 You're also like six foot two.
01:23:03 Yeah, that's true. I forgot.
01:23:06 The scale doesn't care how tall you are.
01:23:08 So you just you only eat in an eight hour window and it's fast for 16 hours
01:23:15 and it's fucking great.
01:23:16 I did it for a week and I almost did that because I've been going to the coffee shop
01:23:20 and they had like little free samples.
01:23:22 Have you been weighing yourself? Have you been weighing yourself?
01:23:25 Do you have progress?
01:23:26 My scale is broken, but I feel significantly better and that's enough for me.
01:23:31 That's good.
01:23:32 Okay, so intermittent fasting sounds really great, but okay,
01:23:35 because like I'm never hungry when I wake up in the morning.
01:23:37 Like I don't want to eat until later in the day.
01:23:39 Yeah.
01:23:40 But isn't that like what they say not to do?
01:23:42 Don't they say to like space your calories out over the day or something?
01:23:45 Well, usually they also suggest to not eat like two or three hours
01:23:50 before going to bed or something like that.
01:23:53 That is commonly suggested.
01:23:54 That's true.
01:23:55 The science behind quote unquote the science behind this.
01:23:58 Yeah, that's all bullshit.
01:23:59 But it's like you have there's like a your when you start,
01:24:02 you're like metabolic, whatever, like when you start digesting things,
01:24:06 like it goes for like, I think like the 10 to 12 hours and then it stops
01:24:10 and anything you eat after that like doesn't get properly metabolized or something.
01:24:14 So like you're, you're designed, I guess designed not to do that.
01:24:18 So I'm just eating it at eight hour window to make sure that that doesn't happen.
01:24:22 I guess I don't know.
01:24:23 I've had, I guess that makes sense.
01:24:24 I've done it before.
01:24:25 I couldn't hunt animals all the time.
01:24:26 And I lost the fucking time to wait just doing it.
01:24:28 So I'm doing it again because it worked for me.
01:24:30 That was last week's topic that you guys were like doing good boy thing.
01:24:34 I wasn't on last week.
01:24:35 So I was drugs.
01:24:36 Okay.
01:24:37 Yeah.
01:24:38 I guess that would be that would be good topic.
01:24:40 We had to, we had to detox after that podcast.
01:24:43 Yeah.
01:24:44 Yeah.
01:24:45 That's right.
01:24:46 That's a good part of the podcast because this week has been very fun for me in terms of
01:24:49 eating food.
01:24:50 And today I've been eating nothing but cake.
01:24:52 So because it's my cake day.
01:24:54 Yes.
01:24:55 It is.
01:24:56 By the way, just continuing going forward.
01:24:58 I've made a resolution.
01:24:59 I'm just, I'm giving up additional sugar just forever.
01:25:02 I'm just, I mean, you know, one day I'll probably go back on that.
01:25:05 But just for the future, I'm not putting sugar in anything.
01:25:08 I'm not eating cake.
01:25:09 I'm not eating anything that has sugar added to it.
01:25:11 I'm like the biggest thing I might do is I might indulge in a glass of fruit.
01:25:15 Juice.
01:25:16 I may do that because that's not, that's not like additional sugar.
01:25:19 It's just the fruit.
01:25:20 But I'm going to try to stay away from it.
01:25:22 Juice is bad for your teeth.
01:25:25 Fair point.
01:25:26 As is coffee, which I have been drinking and I want to be away from it.
01:25:29 But anyway, just brush your teeth an hour after you consume something sugary.
01:25:33 And by the way, since I'm doing this anyway, I'll check in everybody.
01:25:35 I'll let you know how the sugar thing's going.
01:25:37 If I fail, I'll let you know.
01:25:38 I'll let you know.
01:25:39 I wouldn't throw my hand in the ring, but honestly my life is just worse not drinking
01:25:43 carbonated drinks.
01:25:44 So I'm not going to do it.
01:25:46 I'm like my hero Thanos.
01:25:47 I'm willing to take personal sacrifices to achieve the greater good.
01:25:51 As soon as I watch Infinity War, I'm like, this is Nate's OC.
01:25:54 It's Nate.
01:25:55 It's not even.
01:25:56 Yeah.
01:25:57 Like the whole, like having to the movie, I was just like, I was like, Thanos is war.
01:26:00 All right.
01:26:01 That was just my headmate.
01:26:02 He's my headmate.
01:26:03 No, no more Infinity War.
01:26:04 No more.
01:26:05 Wait, he's right.
01:26:06 I'm good too.
01:26:07 I want to say I'm a good boy.
01:26:08 I started tracking my calories again.
01:26:09 Yeah.
01:26:10 Fantastic.
01:26:11 Fantastic.
01:26:12 I can make it, but I'm back.
01:26:13 Great.
01:26:14 Then what is the fear to crack cocaine?
01:26:17 Poor.
01:26:18 Oh yeah?
01:26:19 Are you working out, Ben?
01:26:20 Are you lifting?
01:26:22 I did a bit ago start again, and then I stopped again, but I mean to start again, and I feel
01:26:28 like I've still got a little bit of that momentum, but yeah.
01:26:32 So I did for a second, but I didn't keep up with it.
01:26:35 Why does working out suck so bad?
01:26:38 It feels good to actually do it.
01:26:39 Actually, you know what?
01:26:40 I'll do that today.
01:26:41 Yeah.
01:26:42 Fantastic.
01:26:43 Fantastic.
01:26:44 Thank you.
01:26:45 I've been personally, I've been adding running to my lifts, to my exercise feels great, but
01:26:47 whatever.
01:26:48 Let's move on.
01:26:49 Ben, what, hold on.
01:26:50 What is the pulling out your beard hair about?
01:26:52 Like I've never had that before in my life.
01:26:54 What's why?
01:26:55 Oh God, do we have to talk about this embarrassing?
01:26:57 If you don't want to.
01:26:59 Yeah, I fucking, yeah, I have like a nervous, I have like a nervous tick that I fucking pull
01:27:04 my hair out.
01:27:05 I have a worse nervous tick, Ben.
01:27:06 Yeah, I saw this.
01:27:07 Don't want to make me feel better.
01:27:08 My nervous tick is I bite the shit out of my lips until they bleed.
01:27:13 My nervous tick is I scratch my face off.
01:27:16 My nervous tick is that there's a tick who lives on my head who's just very anxious about
01:27:20 life.
01:27:21 That explains a lot about life.
01:27:24 I have a very wild nervous tick, which is that I grind my index finger.
01:27:26 I do that too, but it's funny.
01:27:28 Yeah.
01:27:29 Wait, wait, wait.
01:27:30 Let Davoo say, let Davoo say something.
01:27:31 I grind my index finger into my thumb on my right hand, and if you do it for only like
01:27:36 a minute, it creates a little groove.
01:27:38 So even though I was only nervous for a minute, I now have like a bubble wrap popping tick
01:27:43 to keep grinding into it and making it worse.
01:27:46 Right?
01:27:47 Hippo.
01:27:48 Hippo.
01:27:49 Like the hair does grow back, but like if it gets bad and it does a lot lately, I will
01:27:56 pick like a small patch or even sometimes like a really big patch.
01:28:00 It has happened before that I have picked off like a large portion of my face has been
01:28:05 like plucked free of beard hair due to my fucking brain problems.
01:28:09 Take your hands busy, Ben.
01:28:11 Well, easier said than done.
01:28:12 Yeah.
01:28:13 Wrap it, wrap it.
01:28:14 I know.
01:28:15 I know.
01:28:16 But like just get into the habits.
01:28:17 Your hands can't stand against your face if they're wrapped around your cock.
01:28:21 It does grow back, but if I do it, if I do it too much of it too fast, it will leave
01:28:24 like a bear patch.
01:28:26 And then I'm like, well, I can't fucking walk around like this and then I have to shave
01:28:29 my beard because.
01:28:30 Ben, you don't go anywhere.
01:28:31 What does it matter?
01:28:33 Well, it just makes me sad all along.
01:28:35 You should wear a coat for your beard.
01:28:38 Tom, I bite the inside of my mouth all the time and I'm constantly tasting blood based
01:28:43 on it.
01:28:44 Oh God.
01:28:45 That would drive me crazy.
01:28:46 That's rough.
01:28:47 I bite my nails.
01:28:48 I bite my nails.
01:28:49 It's pretty bad.
01:28:50 Sometimes it gets bad.
01:28:51 No.
01:28:52 Shall we get to the question?
01:28:53 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:28:54 Let's.
01:28:55 Hey.
01:28:56 Don't bite your nails.
01:28:57 It's very bad for you.
01:28:58 You couldn't be more right.
01:28:59 You couldn't be more right.
01:29:00 I wish I stopped.
01:29:01 I was.
01:29:02 Yeah, but I'm not Michael Jackson of two hands.
01:29:07 That's it.
01:29:08 That's my excuse.
01:29:09 Listen, everybody.
01:29:10 Hashtag ask PCP Twitter at TP Crastinators.
01:29:13 Here's some also in the patron discord, $1 pledge to our fucking patron here in there
01:29:17 and we'll read more questions.
01:29:18 Here's the pity question and we don't need to spend a lot of time with this because I've
01:29:21 looking there are like no good questions, but here's the here's the one that's like
01:29:24 sort of good.
01:29:25 You're all going to hate me, but I'm a read anyway at chemotherapy just asks if giving
01:29:30 up a year of your life advanced human progress by 50 years.
01:29:34 How many years are you willing to give up to those advantage you're waiting for?
01:29:37 And what are they?
01:29:38 Well, zero unless I thought that like within a window that I could buy with that time,
01:29:43 we would hit the singularity.
01:29:44 That's the one.
01:29:45 That's the thing.
01:29:46 Yeah.
01:29:47 My question is, do we advance instantaneously like would I be living in a society 50 years
01:29:51 more advanced by giving up your my life or would it just happen somewhere down the road?
01:29:55 Because if I don't get to experience it, everyone can get fucked.
01:29:58 If I can give up a decade and get a robot body instantly, therefore living forever sounds
01:30:02 like a fair trade.
01:30:03 Yeah.
01:30:04 I mean, I do that.
01:30:05 Yeah.
01:30:06 I guess the question is, do we think we're going to hit the singularity within like, I
01:30:09 don't know, let's say we all have like 50 years left.
01:30:11 So like within 2500 years, will we hit the singularity?
01:30:14 I would give up one year if the advancement of humans by 50 years destroys hypothetical
01:30:22 questions.
01:30:23 Come on.
01:30:25 You know, even even if I don't like him so much, even Digi.
01:30:27 You and Digi are, I have an ethical problem with people that don't like hypothetical questions.
01:30:33 I don't like hypothetical questions.
01:30:35 These are so cratic exercises.
01:30:36 Disliking of hypothetical questions is just evidence of a small mind.
01:30:40 The thing about this particular one is it's just like, here's some numbers, which number
01:30:45 like?
01:30:46 It isn't.
01:30:47 It makes you fucking think.
01:30:48 It makes you fucking question your values.
01:30:50 I'm not thinking.
01:30:51 I do like certain types of hypothetical questions like the ones that like give you really bad
01:30:56 options and then like makes you mentally suffer for them.
01:30:59 I hate those.
01:31:00 Yeah.
01:31:01 No.
01:31:02 I like the ones that make you think like this one is fine, but the ones is like, oh,
01:31:04 would you kill one baby or would you kill like three babies?
01:31:07 I'd definitely kill three.
01:31:08 Unless we have the best.
01:31:09 Here's a hypothesis.
01:31:10 I like that one.
01:31:11 That's funny.
01:31:12 Like what does it mean for it to progress by 50 years?
01:31:15 This isn't vague at all.
01:31:16 God damn.
01:31:17 Yeah, this isn't very vague.
01:31:19 Here's a hypothetical.
01:31:20 What if like the Simpsons were like in Undertale though?
01:31:23 Well, Nate, well, Nate does have yellow skin, so perhaps that's not as far fetched
01:31:32 as you think.
01:31:33 Oh my God.
01:31:34 We're in Undertale Homer.
01:31:35 We got to get out of here.
01:31:36 Back to the original hypothetical question, like if let's say I give up a year, right?
01:31:44 And like I see the advancement happening like immediately.
01:31:48 And would I still have the option to give up one more year after I see what's happened
01:31:52 within those 50 years?
01:31:54 That is a good question.
01:31:55 I don't fucking know.
01:31:57 That actually does make a big difference.
01:31:59 Yeah, because let's say if I could see what's happening.
01:32:03 This is the reason.
01:32:04 This is the reason why I don't like hypothetical questions, at least of this kind.
01:32:08 It's that sometimes the question, like if you're not with the person who made the question,
01:32:14 you can't clarify and then you are just, the discussion is about, I wonder what this question
01:32:18 actually means.
01:32:19 Yeah, I mean, sure.
01:32:20 I think I may have just straight up heard the question wrong.
01:32:23 What exactly was the question?
01:32:25 It's giving up a year of your life, advanced human progress by 50 years, how many years
01:32:29 would you give up?
01:32:30 Yeah, that's too vague.
01:32:31 I insist that that is way too vague.
01:32:34 You guys, you guys, let's get on to the other questions.
01:32:39 Other questions.
01:32:40 This is a significantly less boring than whatever.
01:32:43 It's fun to think about though.
01:32:45 I agree.
01:32:46 I agree.
01:32:47 So anybody fucking looking at the goddamn question bar?
01:32:49 I'm looking at it.
01:32:50 Okay.
01:32:51 What do you got for us?
01:32:52 What do you got for us?
01:32:53 Are we looking at the lounge?
01:32:54 I'm looking at it.
01:32:55 I don't fucking have anything.
01:32:56 Are you joking me?
01:32:57 It's all shit.
01:32:58 There's a question.
01:32:59 Is it made just for you today?
01:33:00 Or did you just really like cake?
01:33:01 Both.
01:33:02 Yeah.
01:33:03 That's good.
01:33:04 That's good.
01:33:05 I'll just substitute the word birthday for cake day because it's more fun that way.
01:33:14 Okay.
01:33:15 I'm just like looking for questions.
01:33:17 Someone asked me, Kajaro Bitterthorn said, if you suddenly acquired a shit ton of money,
01:33:22 what would be the one ridiculously indulgent thing you'd want to do?
01:33:25 I would want a house.
01:33:26 I need a place to live.
01:33:28 Indulgent.
01:33:29 What the fuck dude?
01:33:30 Indulgent.
01:33:31 Be happy with your living cube as dispensed by the state.
01:33:34 Your 3x3 foot.
01:33:35 God, I wish I could have a 3x3 living cube given me by the state.
01:33:40 That's all I need.
01:33:41 As a millennial.
01:33:42 I wouldn't even complain.
01:33:43 Yeah.
01:33:44 Same.
01:33:45 As a millennial, you don't get a house, you get avocado toast instead.
01:33:48 Oh, yeah.
01:33:49 Much like how...
01:33:50 You get Burger King foot lettuce and nothing else.
01:33:53 Much like how Gen Z's, me, are post job.
01:33:56 Millennials are post house.
01:33:57 They do not.
01:33:58 They don't have need for housing.
01:33:59 I don't even want one.
01:34:00 Okay.
01:34:01 I would totally live in a cube.
01:34:02 You know what?
01:34:03 I don't see any good questions.
01:34:04 So it's time to bring back the hashtag PCP bullying segment.
01:34:07 So here we go with Kajaro Bitterthorn asked this terrible question.
01:34:11 If all the members of the PCP had a future diary style battle royale, who would be the
01:34:16 last one standing and who would...
01:34:18 What would your wish be?
01:34:19 I know a person who wouldn't be standing as fucking you because we would all get up on
01:34:22 you and fucking kill you.
01:34:23 You piece of shit.
01:34:24 God!
01:34:25 Agreed.
01:34:26 I'll give it like...
01:34:29 I don't know who would win, but I know who would lose.
01:34:32 The future diary was like because the world was ending, they needed a new God.
01:34:35 So like if none of us did anything, the world would just end and I...
01:34:40 Let it burn.
01:34:41 Let it burn.
01:34:42 Who wants to live in a world with questions like these?
01:34:45 If Nate Besman found a journal that when he wrote down the name of any person on earth,
01:34:49 they died instantly, what would he do with it?
01:34:52 That has to be a joke.
01:34:53 That has to be intentionally bad.
01:34:54 I've got to write a manga about that concept.
01:34:57 There's no way that fucking...
01:35:00 There's no way that that guy who got that fucking book could make nearly as much of
01:35:05 a clusterfuck as the utilitarianist machinations of Best Guy Ever.
01:35:09 Yeah.
01:35:10 You ain't wrong.
01:35:11 Hey, here's a question that's not inherently shit, kind of.
01:35:15 Night Shift Clint asks, is all porn cuckoo-y?
01:35:19 Now hang on, you aren't pleasuring yourself to something slash someone you want to fuck
01:35:24 or get fucked by being fucked or getting fucked by something else.
01:35:28 Yeah.
01:35:29 What do you think?
01:35:30 That assumes things about the porn that you want.
01:35:31 I think yes.
01:35:32 Oh, well...
01:35:33 No, I mean you're just watching other people fucking and it's not you, so you know.
01:35:36 There's porn that is not to people.
01:35:37 Oh, well, I mean that's true.
01:35:39 That is true.
01:35:40 Well, still, you're watching something desirable and not participating in it yourself.
01:35:44 True.
01:35:45 But you know what?
01:35:46 It's really...
01:35:47 If you're a real cuck in real life, which again, there is no act...
01:35:51 It's fine if you do that.
01:35:52 Can I jump off this for a second?
01:35:53 But you enjoy not being involved.
01:35:55 Do you?
01:35:56 I would prefer to be involved in porn, physically.
01:35:59 This is something I thought about.
01:36:00 Do you think that cuckolding became a thing because everyone just watches porn so much
01:36:05 now?
01:36:06 Hmm.
01:36:07 I've always thought...
01:36:08 The rise of cuckolding is a result of people watching porn.
01:36:11 This is actually like really surprising to me.
01:36:12 Lots of thinking emojis right now.
01:36:13 I can't believe this.
01:36:14 That someone just casually dropped like an existential like total actual accuracy bomb
01:36:18 like that.
01:36:19 But I think I'm going to go with yeah.
01:36:20 Like, because...
01:36:21 Well, I don't know.
01:36:22 Because now I'm thinking about it, because I'm not into cucking, but I'm thinking...
01:36:26 I feel like I can possibly empathize with it a lot better now, because it's like the
01:36:30 idea is if you are not part of the, you know, you're just watching it, you're just...
01:36:34 You're not really there.
01:36:35 You have no accountability, no responsibility, nothing you can do wrong.
01:36:39 You can just project yourself on completely guilt-free, and that's kind of like why porn
01:36:44 is a lot easier than like actual sex, you know?
01:36:46 You don't have to like worry about anything.
01:36:47 I feel like...
01:36:48 I'm not cuckolding.
01:36:49 Just makes me sad.
01:36:50 Like down to my core, I hate it.
01:36:51 I mean, sure.
01:36:52 I feel like the appeal would be slightly different.
01:36:55 Like if it was like a live action, and then the girl says, haha, you're not doing it.
01:37:00 And then the person watching the screen is like, damn.
01:37:02 Yeah, that's real cuckoldry.
01:37:03 That's real cuckoldry.
01:37:05 Even if you're like...
01:37:06 If it's playing into that aspect.
01:37:07 If it's a picture, then you couldn't possibly be there, because they don't exist.
01:37:11 Yeah.
01:37:12 It's slightly different.
01:37:14 You know, I don't think they're like one and the same.
01:37:15 There might be a thread of connection, possibly, but I mean, I don't think they're anything.
01:37:19 You know, I have felt this way.
01:37:20 I have gone down this rabbit hole before and been like, okay, I'm watching this thing that
01:37:26 I like, but it's not me.
01:37:29 And I've gotten a little annoyed about it, like, damn it, why am I enjoying this?
01:37:33 Like this is just, this is what they want from me.
01:37:36 Like they tricked me.
01:37:37 Oh, yeah.
01:37:38 Like the porn.
01:37:39 Damn it.
01:37:40 Yeah.
01:37:41 They've won.
01:37:42 Like they went and did something good, something cool, and I am over here, like what, appreciating
01:37:47 them for that?
01:37:48 Fuck that.
01:37:49 I mean, you know, I mean, there's like, for example, you know, like video games are like
01:37:52 achievement simulators that you're not actually like, so like in the same way, you're kind
01:37:56 of like a cuck to like success of other people in a way, though I guess you are like playing
01:38:00 the game, but it's a little different, I guess.
01:38:02 You right now, viewer, are a cuck because you are not debating with the legendary best
01:38:06 guy ever.
01:38:07 You are leaving by carestakingly with the other podcast members.
01:38:09 You are a cuck right now.
01:38:11 Kill yourself.
01:38:12 All the rest of us are such relatable characters and Nate is just such a, such a, such a hateable
01:38:17 villain.
01:38:18 So he's a juggernaut of industry.
01:38:21 Here's a question by my cool man from the Patreon lounge.
01:38:24 When is the right age to have children?
01:38:25 And I also want to open this up to when's the right age to get married because this
01:38:28 is a thing that's, that's kind of a lot with the PCP as we all know.
01:38:36 Well, okay.
01:38:37 I think.
01:38:38 Yeah, go ahead.
01:38:39 Go ahead.
01:38:40 Go ahead.
01:38:41 I think the right age to have children is whenever you're ready.
01:38:42 But yeah, I think having it too young will, like if you have it in your early twenties
01:38:48 or mid twenties, that's a lot of people did do that, but they, they, I mean, I can't assume
01:38:55 how they feel about it, but I, I don't think they would have, like some people may not
01:38:59 have liked it.
01:39:00 I guess it depends on what you want out of it and how you would want it in the first
01:39:04 one.
01:39:05 That's a yes to finish education just, just in case.
01:39:06 How it is when you're figuring out all the basic things in your life and you are no longer
01:39:11 feeling challenged, then do it.
01:39:14 Don't have kids because your parents want grandkids.
01:39:16 Oh yeah.
01:39:17 Fuck people.
01:39:18 Sure.
01:39:19 That's definitely, you gotta be financially stable.
01:39:21 Don't let the wanton of a baby be the thing that makes you have the baby.
01:39:25 Make it that you've, you've basically, you can go through your life day and be like, wow,
01:39:29 I didn't like freak out or emotionally melt down over anything and I have enough money
01:39:33 to be stable.
01:39:34 Wow.
01:39:35 It's a little bit boring.
01:39:36 Wait for when you're a little bit bored, not out of like depression boredom, but like
01:39:39 out of complacency boredom.
01:39:40 You know.
01:39:41 Then have kids.
01:39:42 Then you'll actually love your children for like genuinely and not like the sort of passive
01:39:45 aggressive love that most parents give.
01:39:47 I'm like, oh man, it sure is great taking care of you and not having a life.
01:39:52 And like, because the way I sort of see having a child is like your life ends there and like
01:39:57 now you're solely dedicated to making that child be successful.
01:40:01 There's been a rise of the argument that like immoral, it is literally immoral to have kids
01:40:07 and like, I understand the argument there.
01:40:10 It's immoral to have kids.
01:40:11 It's like bringing someone into the world against, you know, they can't consent to being
01:40:14 bored.
01:40:15 I mean, that's true.
01:40:16 And there will be some suffering in life.
01:40:18 And so like, I could see why people make that argument, but like, if you're trying to give
01:40:24 your kid the best chance possible, then I personally would argue that that's a pretty
01:40:28 pessimistic view.
01:40:29 I feel like there's good to be had.
01:40:30 I feel like there's sort of pessimistic, but it doesn't make it wrong.
01:40:32 Well, it's pessimistic, but it doesn't make it wrong.
01:40:33 Having children is immoral.
01:40:34 No, I'm not saying it's wrong.
01:40:35 Is kind of strange.
01:40:37 Well, hang on, Ben.
01:40:38 Are you arguing?
01:40:39 What do you think about that argument?
01:40:41 Well, that's, I mean, I don't.
01:40:46 It's tough.
01:40:47 I know it's a complicated thing.
01:40:48 Well, I think, I don't think it's immoral.
01:40:52 I don't think it's immoral to create a life, no.
01:40:57 I get, I could see why someone would think that if someone thinks that life is suffering
01:41:02 and terrible and not worth living, then I could see why you'd be like, well, why would
01:41:05 I want to force that on someone?
01:41:07 Like, I get it.
01:41:08 I think it's immoral.
01:41:09 I think if you're not able to properly take care of the child, I think if you're, that's
01:41:14 definitely true.
01:41:15 Even if you are able to properly take care of them, that doesn't mean they're going to
01:41:17 have a good time.
01:41:18 No, it doesn't.
01:41:19 But at that point, it becomes nebulous.
01:41:22 But I think it's absolutely wrong to have a child when you're not properly able to take
01:41:26 care of them.
01:41:27 This whole issue, I remember hearing this, like, way back, I've heard this on the internet
01:41:30 forever.
01:41:31 Like, oh man, a life is suffering.
01:41:32 Is it right to bring kids?
01:41:33 You know, like, if there was like a reverse limbo where you hang out before you have life,
01:41:38 like all it would take is some propaganda.
01:41:40 Like Pixar could have like a five minute little short animation before one of their movies,
01:41:44 which is this, right?
01:41:45 It's just like these little identity list souls hanging out in like pre-limbo, right?
01:41:50 And like they're all like really excited to like get a chance for life and they get, they're
01:41:54 given warnings.
01:41:55 It could be painful.
01:41:56 It could be hard.
01:41:57 But like if you're given the chance, you might be able to like live and experience things,
01:42:01 right?
01:42:02 And they'd be all like, everybody would be fucking excited to try it out.
01:42:04 So no, I'm going to say it's immoral to have kids if you're not ready, if you're being ignorant
01:42:10 about it.
01:42:11 But that's not actually how things work though.
01:42:12 I just consider ignorance to be a bad thing in general.
01:42:15 That's a very underrated sin.
01:42:21 Well, about the whole, back to the question originally, I do feel very strongly that there
01:42:25 is no right age to have kids or get married or do anything right.
01:42:29 Well, there is a certain age past which you should probably not be having kids if you're
01:42:34 a woman due to...
01:42:35 That is technically true.
01:42:37 Okay.
01:42:38 Yeah.
01:42:39 Well, I mean...
01:42:40 Do you mean like you shouldn't or like you couldn't?
01:42:43 Well, it becomes a lot more complicated the older you get, like there might be birth complications
01:42:48 in the child you birth might not need.
01:42:50 That's true.
01:42:51 That's always a risk.
01:42:52 Yeah.
01:42:53 To a certain extent.
01:42:54 No, no, no.
01:42:55 I'm not saying you shouldn't.
01:42:56 It's just like you might want to start thinking about those things.
01:43:01 Like Maja's saying, like just as it makes sense to establish yourself financially before you
01:43:06 have kids, it also, in the same vein, like it is a biological fact and the current
01:43:10 world that like the older woman is, you know, like when a woman's like 65, like the likelihood
01:43:15 of their kid, I think specifically was having Down syndrome.
01:43:18 The percentage goes up a lot.
01:43:19 The menopause starts around 40 years old, I think.
01:43:22 Okay.
01:43:23 Let's say 40 or whatever it is.
01:43:25 So it's just that you're like, I'm just saying it's, I'm not saying it's immoral or anything.
01:43:28 It's just like you are not inherently necessarily giving your kid the most optimum chance in
01:43:33 the world.
01:43:34 That's all.
01:43:35 You know?
01:43:36 Well, we've all got to do the best with what we're given.
01:43:37 Yeah.
01:43:38 I agree.
01:43:39 Just saying.
01:43:40 Yeah.
01:43:41 Yeah.
01:43:42 It's just something to consider about your own life and stuff.
01:43:43 It's a fair point.
01:43:44 It's a fair point.
01:43:45 I definitely agree with you, Ben.
01:43:46 There is no real like right age to do anything, but I think there are certain like ages you
01:43:52 can genuinely like say where someone will be like maturity or like, you know, financially
01:43:58 or like, you know, well off wise.
01:44:00 Yeah.
01:44:01 You want to be stable.
01:44:02 I would say like the golden age for both those are probably like 35 for me.
01:44:06 That's probably a nice like late number.
01:44:10 Yeah.
01:44:11 That's pretty late.
01:44:12 I mean, for, I don't know.
01:44:13 Maybe not for millennials.
01:44:14 I mean, maybe not for millennials.
01:44:15 Literally 35 when they had us.
01:44:16 I mean, the average age is getting later.
01:44:18 Yeah.
01:44:19 I think.
01:44:20 Yeah.
01:44:21 Oh, well, actually, I mean, just unfortunately for men, that's perfectly fine.
01:44:23 For women, it actually does have some ramifications.
01:44:25 Yeah.
01:44:26 My parents were both 34 actually.
01:44:28 I think our parents were in there like mid-30s.
01:44:30 Yeah.
01:44:31 They were right around there.
01:44:32 They were right around there.
01:44:33 Yeah.
01:44:34 My mom was fucking 40, baby.
01:44:35 That's why you got that fetal alcohol syndrome.
01:44:38 Yeah.
01:44:39 Give it up for Down syndrome, everybody.
01:44:42 Because as you get older, your blood just turns to alcohol.
01:44:48 You just ferment.
01:44:51 Yes.
01:44:52 I'll just say that I agree that like getting married and having kids is basically fine.
01:44:57 You know, biologically speaking, it makes sense to do it fairly early for a woman and
01:45:01 then financially you want to be stable.
01:45:03 That's really all I have to say.
01:45:04 But I would also just say that as opposed to age to do it, I personally just think I
01:45:09 would really want to vet the person I'm marrying before I commit my whole fucking life to
01:45:14 them.
01:45:15 That's true.
01:45:16 I'd give them a couple years, frankly.
01:45:17 That's me.
01:45:18 Yeah.
01:45:19 That's me.
01:45:20 Yeah.
01:45:21 I don't think anyone would disagree.
01:45:22 A couple years.
01:45:23 No, I think you should probably jump into these things willy-nilly.
01:45:25 Yeah.
01:45:26 Yeah.
01:45:27 In my humble opinion, feel free to disagree.
01:45:33 All right.
01:45:34 Well, fuck it.
01:45:35 Let's move on.
01:45:36 Oh, there was one other question here that I wanted to reach and this goes beyond just
01:45:39 the specifics here.
01:45:40 It's just StanOnWheels asks, I'm sure in reference to the Furry podcast, is ActionGiraffe a fursona?
01:45:47 And this pretends to all animal boys.
01:45:49 Obviously.
01:45:50 No, he's not.
01:45:51 He's a separate entity.
01:45:52 Obviously.
01:45:53 Yeah.
01:45:54 ActionGiraffe is a completely separate entity.
01:45:55 He is a real-life globetrotting superstar who is a headmate of mine occasionally, but
01:45:59 he just travels rift to rift and, you know, he's got nothing to do with it.
01:46:03 Oh, he's occasionally, but not exclusively, a headmate.
01:46:07 Like, yeah, he has his own, he's got the outside.
01:46:10 He's incidentally also your headmate, but that's just kind of a coincidence.
01:46:13 He owns some time shares in your head.
01:46:14 He's got Ramona flowers.
01:46:16 The Ramona flowers like Skateboards.
01:46:18 Oh, okay.
01:46:19 Skateboards in a sick way.
01:46:20 When he doesn't have any other place to crash you, especially Skateboards.
01:46:22 Boy, that's right.
01:46:23 He owns a time share in Nate's head.
01:46:25 Boy, that's a new twist on the character.
01:46:27 When are we gonna get new fucking lore?
01:46:30 It's been like years.
01:46:31 What the fuck?
01:46:32 Why don't you watch ActionGiraffe is the best shit?
01:46:34 Why don't you watch the currently released as the time of this release, Weagua, that
01:46:38 is out right now that may or may not have him in a starring role?
01:46:41 Wait, does it actually, though?
01:46:44 Literally yes.
01:46:45 Okay.
01:46:46 Literally yes.
01:46:47 I was like, why don't you go watch Weagua?
01:46:49 He may or may not be there, but actually he's not.
01:46:51 It's a lie.
01:46:52 But he's not.
01:46:53 But he's not.
01:46:54 Yeah, go watch Weagua, everybody.
01:46:55 ActionGiraffe.
01:46:56 There he is.
01:46:57 He's making a hiatus from his globe trotting and his movie Action starring with Tom Cruise.
01:47:00 And his AIDS habits.
01:47:01 And his AIDS habits.
01:47:02 No, no, no.
01:47:03 There's no hiatus from that.
01:47:04 He's committed to that lifestyle.
01:47:06 But I was just gonna say, everybody, that stupid walrus digit keeps insisting is a real
01:47:12 character that we all know isn't.
01:47:14 That's not a fursona.
01:47:16 Is investigator a fursona?
01:47:18 No, obviously not.
01:47:19 These are real human being non-animal boys.
01:47:22 They're their own guys.
01:47:26 Hey, are we done with that question?
01:47:28 Yeah, I'm not gonna say that.
01:47:29 I see Kajoro Bitterthorn asks, to all the members who haven't made lectures yet, do
01:47:33 you plan to in the future and what would they be about?
01:47:36 Yes.
01:47:37 Hey, they're all out, everybody.
01:47:38 Just shout out.
01:47:39 They're all out.
01:47:40 All lectures from RadCon three are out.
01:47:41 Mine was the last one from RadCon.
01:47:42 That's right.
01:47:43 Actually, it was the last one to happen, too, and the last one to release.
01:47:46 That's right.
01:47:47 Neat.
01:47:48 Nifty.
01:47:49 I'm probably gonna say fashion.
01:47:50 You're excited?
01:47:51 It was the last one to be done.
01:47:54 I feel like I said in a questions of a PCP already that I'm planning on thinking of doing
01:48:03 a lecture.
01:48:04 Well, I guess everybody else.
01:48:05 When's the mage lecture gonna come out?
01:48:07 I don't know.
01:48:08 I don't know enough about things and stuff to do a lecture on.
01:48:11 Mage, just do a lecture on Lithuania.
01:48:14 Water cats.
01:48:15 What?
01:48:16 Water cat.
01:48:17 Oh, wait.
01:48:18 Do the lecture on what are those things where you sell OCs to people that's under their
01:48:21 things.
01:48:22 Exactly.
01:48:23 One, to transfer Munchy, I never read the water cat things.
01:48:27 Oh, it seems right up your alley.
01:48:31 Reading books of my alley.
01:48:33 Excuse you.
01:48:34 Anywho.
01:48:35 The adaptable thing.
01:48:36 I'm a very newbie in that area, so I don't really have the authority to lecture anyone
01:48:42 about it.
01:48:43 That hasn't stopped any of us.
01:48:45 Yeah.
01:48:46 Yeah.
01:48:47 I don't...
01:48:48 Yeah.
01:48:49 There's really only one thing I could do a lecture on, which is the game over thinker.
01:48:53 We've been talking about that for a while.
01:48:56 Davoo, you have to do a lecture on the Bible.
01:48:58 It has to happen.
01:48:59 I know.
01:49:00 I've been saying that right now.
01:49:01 I want that hot Davoo take.
01:49:02 We've got to do that.
01:49:03 We've got to film that in a church.
01:49:04 No, no, no.
01:49:05 Move the lecture.
01:49:06 You're supposed to lecture on something that you have an exceptional amount of knowledge
01:49:08 on, not just like above average.
01:49:09 That is true.
01:49:10 That's the ideal.
01:49:11 I'll do a lecture on God in the church.
01:49:13 I'll get the priest to do it.
01:49:14 The tough thing about the game over thinker is that I want to just psychoanalyze Movie
01:49:20 Bob for all day, but I think I'll just focus on the plot of the game over thinker series.
01:49:26 Just somewhere like that will probably be sufficient.
01:49:29 Would you argue that Movie Bob's game over thinker is similar to Sonichu in that there's
01:49:34 a story of a man behind this.
01:49:36 Yeah.
01:49:37 It actually apparently just relaunched the game over thinker series.
01:49:41 He's been trying to keep that ball rolling for a long time.
01:49:44 Yeah.
01:49:45 I guess I'll talk about that in the lecture.
01:49:47 I have a little bit of catching up to do, but not that much.
01:49:51 By the way, Davoo, on the last episode for drugs, I was doing the show notes and I searched
01:49:58 up the game over thinker episode like seven or whatever it was because you mentioned
01:50:03 they had bad audio.
01:50:04 Oh my God.
01:50:05 Yeah.
01:50:06 The audio was on parallel.
01:50:09 It was unbelievable.
01:50:12 Yeah.
01:50:13 I couldn't have fathomed.
01:50:15 It was behind seven walls.
01:50:18 It was behind seven walls and it was into a tin cannon and also underwater at the same
01:50:23 time.
01:50:24 You really can't oversell it.
01:50:26 Anyone who's getting hyped for how bad the audio is is not getting over hyped.
01:50:29 I'm going to look at that.
01:50:32 I have a couple good questions by this one guy.
01:50:35 One's bar.
01:50:36 Yes.
01:50:37 The two that I think are the best are, have you ever had any interesting or noteworthy
01:50:40 encounters with panhandlers or homeless people?
01:50:42 What do you think about how your community services deal with homeless people?
01:50:47 San Diego is notorious for being like one of the worst homeless cities in America.
01:50:53 It's absolutely terrible.
01:50:55 They just roam the streets constantly and they are just everywhere.
01:50:58 Absolutely everywhere.
01:50:59 Funny story Jackie told me about the homeless population in Atlanta.
01:51:03 Apparently when the Olympics came to Atlanta a couple years ago, the government of Atlanta
01:51:08 just paid lots of homeless people to leave.
01:51:12 They were like, here's some money.
01:51:15 Get out.
01:51:16 The Olympics are coming and we don't want you embarrassing us.
01:51:19 Oh my God.
01:51:21 That's a fix right there.
01:51:23 That's a fix.
01:51:24 Well, I'll tell you right now.
01:51:25 Just enough for a taxi ride?
01:51:27 That's a temporary solution.
01:51:28 I'll tell you right now.
01:51:29 Thanos would have implemented a permanent solution to this homeless situation if you
01:51:32 know what I'm saying.
01:51:33 When Hippo said how much money, I was just imagining him thinking, I'll find out where
01:51:38 the Olympics are going next and I'm going to be homeless there.
01:51:42 Free money.
01:51:43 What?
01:51:44 What an elaborate scheme.
01:51:49 I'll be the most homeless person on earth.
01:51:53 This was not exactly a homeless person or a panhandler, but one time I was walking around
01:51:59 New York.
01:52:00 I was in college and I was walking around and a guy, you know, he was like a black guy
01:52:07 in like an African robe or something.
01:52:10 He was all like traditionally dressed.
01:52:12 He was one of those guys that's like something about being Jewish, like black people are
01:52:18 like the real Jewish people, you know?
01:52:22 Those guys.
01:52:23 I was with my girlfriend at the time and I was taken completely off guard when he shouted
01:52:30 me out in the crowd and he was like, do you know that you are the devil?
01:52:36 Oh.
01:52:37 Because I was white because he was saying that white people are the devil.
01:52:39 He was like, do you know that you are the devil?
01:52:41 And I was like, no, sir, I did not.
01:52:44 Damn.
01:52:45 And I thought I handled it pretty well.
01:52:48 It's fucking just how true some facts are.
01:52:56 Well, as a future homeless person, I'm sure I'll be able to answer this question in great
01:53:00 detail in like a year or two.
01:53:02 Tom's going to be on the other side of this question.
01:53:03 All my crazy adventures will be great.
01:53:05 Actually, when I said no, sir, I did not.
01:53:07 Some guy in the crowd started snickering and I was like, yeah, guys.
01:53:11 Got him, dude.
01:53:12 Turn it around.
01:53:13 The other question from one spar is, do we need to answer this?
01:53:15 Oh, wait, wait, sorry.
01:53:16 Can I just respond to that?
01:53:17 This is just a short thing, but like this guy was home.
01:53:20 It wasn't like panhandling, but it was like a homeless guy.
01:53:22 So when I was in Japan and this experience haunts me to this day, I'm walking back from
01:53:27 the gym.
01:53:28 You know, it's like, Japan's like wealthy.
01:53:30 I'm just, I'm in Tokyo.
01:53:31 Just everyone's like going about their business, being a real dude in the city.
01:53:35 And I'm just walking back.
01:53:36 You know, it's the American guy walking through the city.
01:53:38 And I just, I see a homeless guy sitting on the side of the road and he's got all this
01:53:42 shit around him and stuff.
01:53:43 He's like, you know, dirty and stuff.
01:53:44 You know, it's fine.
01:53:45 It's just what he was.
01:53:46 And I look at him and I'm like, wait, he's playing with something.
01:53:49 What's he holding in his hands there?
01:53:50 His hands are like down, you know, like by his, by his crotch.
01:53:52 I'm like, what's he holding there?
01:53:53 Wait a minute.
01:53:54 No.
01:53:55 It is.
01:53:56 Is that his penis?
01:53:59 And it was.
01:54:00 And it was in fact his penis.
01:54:02 And you jumped in.
01:54:03 He just, he had his dick out.
01:54:04 He was playing with it like in public before the eyes of God's and man.
01:54:09 And he was just doing that.
01:54:11 And what stood out to me was I was like, what?
01:54:15 What's going on here?
01:54:16 So I was like shocked, but what truly fascinated me about the situation was how everyone else
01:54:22 just kept walking.
01:54:24 Like this was an obvious thing.
01:54:26 Anyone who looked and see this shit, but nobody stopped to say anything.
01:54:29 I'm not saying that I'm a hero or anything.
01:54:31 I'm just saying like it was amazing.
01:54:32 Who wants to engage with that shit?
01:54:34 Yeah.
01:54:35 I just.
01:54:36 Excuse me a homeless guy.
01:54:37 Put that junk in that trunk.
01:54:39 I mean, I just was like, I fucking did a double take.
01:54:42 I was like, what?
01:54:43 But like people just.
01:54:44 Looked past.
01:54:45 Maybe he was like doing a performance and he had his hat on the floor.
01:54:48 He's supposed to throw a little coin in there.
01:54:50 Yeah.
01:54:51 Nice dick.
01:54:52 You walk over to him and you're like, hey, sir, put that away.
01:54:56 And then he takes off his penis revealing that it's actually a hidden camera.
01:54:59 And he says, you're on national TV.
01:55:03 That'd be great.
01:55:04 A candid camera type of show, but it's exclusively guys jacking off.
01:55:10 Like just always jacking off.
01:55:13 They're always actually jacking off.
01:55:16 It's not actually a prank.
01:55:18 They're just filming it and then making fun of you for noticing.
01:55:22 Social experiment.
01:55:23 Yeah.
01:55:24 I don't see how this can go wrong.
01:55:26 Oh dude, right?
01:55:27 Confort, right?
01:55:28 Munchie, I see this in your future as a performance artist.
01:55:32 I'll be 18.
01:55:33 It'll be all good.
01:55:34 Finally.
01:55:35 The last question I think we want to do here, another one by OneSpar.
01:55:37 Do any of you listen to the news either on radio or TV?
01:55:41 And what are your preferred sources for world-slash-local news?
01:55:45 Alex Jones!
01:55:46 He'll give you the real shit.
01:55:48 He'll give you the real shit.
01:55:50 I'm a BBC lad.
01:55:52 I grew up watching that.
01:55:53 I don't look at it that much, but whenever a dad comes home, he puts it in the mouth.
01:55:57 I knew someone was going to say it.
01:55:59 I had to go there.
01:56:00 It was so obvious.
01:56:01 I had to.
01:56:02 Wait, what?
01:56:03 Big Black Cox.
01:56:04 You love him.
01:56:05 The BBC.
01:56:06 I mean, unrelated, but yeah.
01:56:07 What an unfortunate abbreviation.
01:56:10 Coincidentally, a fan of both things.
01:56:13 Well, hold on.
01:56:14 You can say all of them.
01:56:15 It's just another failure of language.
01:56:17 BBC came first.
01:56:18 All of them could be like that.
01:56:19 But the big black cock came as well.
01:56:21 Well, the big black cock has been here long before any of us, and it will be.
01:56:25 It's referenced in the Bible.
01:56:28 Literally all of them could be abbreviations like ABC, anal block, clog.
01:56:34 Did you get anal beat cleavage?
01:56:38 Did you know that big black cocks are in fact referenced in the Bible?
01:56:41 Is that true?
01:56:42 Actually, someone, okay, I wanted to answer this question, but I didn't have a good answer
01:56:46 prepared.
01:56:47 Someone asked a favorite Bible verse, even if you're not a Christian.
01:56:50 Now I know it, because I remember there's a verse in the Bible that specifically, it's
01:56:56 something about like, we don't fuck with that tribe over there.
01:57:00 We don't let our women go over to that tribe because quote, their flesh is as the flesh
01:57:05 of asses.
01:57:06 I think they have big donkey tics.
01:57:09 Are you sure that's what they meant by that?
01:57:11 Well, I was assured that it was.
01:57:13 The person assuring me could have been wrong, but I choose to believe that it's good.
01:57:18 And God said gizam.
01:57:21 Look at that shit.
01:57:23 I personally listen to a variety of news sources.
01:57:26 I really try to mix things up, and like, there's no one is unbiased.
01:57:30 So I just try to mix up and listen to a bunch of different biased people.
01:57:33 Like the young Turks.
01:57:34 I'll listen to Kyle Kulinski.
01:57:36 Kulinski, whatever his name is, secular talk.
01:57:38 Like a review tech USA, sometimes less of a news guy.
01:57:42 And then like also like Ben Shapiro.
01:57:44 Whoa, you took a right turn there.
01:57:47 Well, that's the thing.
01:57:48 There is no online person who's really in the middle.
01:57:51 Like everyone has their agenda.
01:57:53 So I just try, and Stefan, I'll listen to some things.
01:57:55 I just listen to as much biased shit on either side.
01:57:58 And then I just form it in my mind and mix it.
01:58:01 I just like hear whatever like comes through the fucking, you know, osmosis.
01:58:05 By the way, my favorite Bible verse, Ezekiel 2320 through 21st.
01:58:10 There she lusted after her lovers whose genitals were like those of donkeys
01:58:14 and whose emission was like that of horses.
01:58:17 Dude, I think that's exactly the one I was talking about.
01:58:19 That's probably the one.
01:58:20 That's probably the one.
01:58:21 Damn, emission was like that of horses.
01:58:23 So they like, they know what a horse emission is like.
01:58:26 So you longed for the lewdness of your youth when in Egypt
01:58:29 your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.
01:58:35 Now we're talking.
01:58:36 Opposite of me, it looks like I'm going to be a Christian.
01:58:43 I'm sick of the porn on the internet. Bible porn only, please.
01:58:47 There's one more question that we, you know, this could be our final thing.
01:58:50 It's just, it's again, it's for once bar.
01:58:52 And here, this is it.
01:58:53 It's, do you think there is enough PCP fan content?
01:58:56 Should there be more?
01:58:57 No!
01:58:58 And what would you like to see or not like to see?
01:59:00 First of all, the answer is no.
01:59:01 Great question.
01:59:02 And based on this question, I'm actually happy to announce
01:59:05 we're beginning something here today
01:59:07 that we've been discussing amongst ourselves
01:59:09 and we are starting a contest
01:59:11 to create an opening theme song for the PCP.
01:59:15 Oh, right.
01:59:16 Remember that, guys?
01:59:18 Remember that?
01:59:19 So starting right now.
01:59:21 Hashtag PCP theme.
01:59:23 Or I don't know.
01:59:24 Yeah, well, I guess we'll stick with that.
01:59:25 The PC theme.
01:59:27 PCP theme, whatever.
01:59:29 Or PC theme.
01:59:30 Do the first one.
01:59:31 It's clear.
01:59:32 Listen, everybody, make music
01:59:34 or whatever the fuck you want.
01:59:36 And we will listen to it.
01:59:37 And we will not necessarily pick one,
01:59:39 but they will all be reviewed
01:59:41 and we will do a fucking thing.
01:59:43 We're looking for some intro song.
01:59:45 We love the one that we have now.
01:59:46 It's just a little low key, you know,
01:59:48 which it works better as an outro.
01:59:50 So we're looking for something to start the show off
01:59:52 in a hype-ass kind of way.
01:59:54 So if you're an audio mixer,
01:59:56 you're a musicsman,
01:59:58 and you want to submit this,
01:59:59 go to the Twitter.
02:00:00 Hashtag PCP theme.
02:00:02 Submit some fucking audio that we can listen to
02:00:04 if you want to be fucking entering this thing.
02:00:06 That's it.
02:00:07 What you should do is get, like,
02:00:10 songs from all of our favorite bands
02:00:13 that we have mentioned at various points
02:00:15 and just put them layered on top of each other.
02:00:17 It doesn't matter whether the BPMs are correct
02:00:20 and go right up to the mic and say,
02:00:27 That's a good one.
02:00:28 I like that one.
02:00:29 But this is real.
02:00:30 This is going to be a big thing.
02:00:31 We've been dancing around trying to figure out
02:00:33 how to start the shows off for a while,
02:00:35 and this is our solution.
02:00:36 This, we throw it back to you guys.
02:00:38 You'll be forever immortalized
02:00:40 as a fucking intro song if we pick it.
02:00:42 So that's it.
02:00:43 That's it, everybody.
02:00:44 There is no prize.
02:00:45 There is no fucking prize
02:00:47 other than the legend.
02:00:48 Well, the prize is that your thing
02:00:50 will become the thing
02:00:51 and that we will say well done
02:00:53 and point people in your direction.
02:00:54 And you'll be credited in the video descriptions.
02:00:57 It's literally exposure.
02:00:58 Of course.
02:00:59 That's correct.
02:01:00 So only do it if you're happy to not be paid.
02:01:02 That's the thing.
02:01:04 There you go, everybody.
02:01:05 Started right now.
02:01:06 Hashtag PCP theme.
02:01:08 Get going.
02:01:09 There you go.
02:01:10 It feels wrong for me to say,
02:01:12 Yeah, guys, make more PCP fan-er.
02:01:15 It feels wrong to be like,
02:01:17 no, there's not enough fan content.
02:01:19 But all I know is that I would enjoy
02:01:22 if there were more little bit of munchies
02:01:24 running around.
02:01:25 I would like that.
02:01:26 Yeah.
02:01:27 Well, Munchie, you and me both know
02:01:29 that by asking for fan-er, it will happen.
02:01:31 Our retrieval has so much more fan-er
02:01:33 than the PCP.
02:01:34 But that's because our retrieval is good
02:01:36 and it is inspiring.
02:01:38 Oh, you're right.
02:01:39 You know what it is?
02:01:40 Our retrieval is way more specific
02:01:41 and has a visual style that can be utilized,
02:01:44 which is like homestuck style and stuff.
02:01:47 So that goes a long way.
02:01:48 That goes a long way, I'd say.
02:01:50 My favorite PCP fan content.
02:01:51 You know what I gotta say?
02:01:53 How has it been at this point two weeks
02:01:55 since the furry cast?
02:01:56 And we only had one person draw us all his furries.
02:01:59 No, there was more than one.
02:02:02 There were two.
02:02:03 Well, you, Ben, got a few extra arts.
02:02:05 Yeah, like Ben got one.
02:02:07 Yeah, us all as PCP.
02:02:08 Oh, yeah, that's right.
02:02:09 I got a bonus.
02:02:11 That was good.
02:02:12 Pretty disappointed with all of you.
02:02:15 You're not gonna lie.
02:02:16 The best PCP fan stuff was not even by a fan.
02:02:20 It was by fucking Ben St. here.
02:02:22 And it was that comic that was just the PCP University
02:02:25 and it was just like a little comic
02:02:27 based upon a discussion that was in the episode.
02:02:29 That was a mess.
02:02:30 Yeah, it was the PCP University one.
02:02:32 I think I did two of those, right?
02:02:34 I did a second one.
02:02:35 I don't think so.
02:02:36 I did the one up into the table.
02:02:38 Yeah, yeah, of like Nate.
02:02:40 It's like, it's just me.
02:02:41 It's nobody else.
02:02:42 I'm here.
02:02:43 Oh, yeah, that's right.
02:02:44 Yeah, so I've done two of those.
02:02:46 I should do more.
02:02:47 Of course, a shout out to the PCP animated guys
02:02:50 who did those.
02:02:51 Zenhuxnable and the other person who I forget at the moment.
02:02:54 Shout out to 1, 2, 3.
02:02:56 Wait, no, who was that?
02:02:57 Our schedule animated, which was unparalleled
02:02:59 and the best thing that's ever happened to me.
02:03:01 That was the best part.
02:03:02 Yep.
02:03:03 Best piece of fan content that has ever happened to me ever
02:03:05 was to shout out to 1, 2, 3.
02:03:06 Sure.
02:03:07 Our schedule animated.
02:03:08 Our retrieval and therefore banned and elicit.
02:03:11 Absolutely perfect.
02:03:12 Also, thank you to everybody who draws punk.
02:03:15 That's the cool.
02:03:16 I like it when you do that.
02:03:17 Asha in the AM was the other one.
02:03:19 That's the one.
02:03:20 That's the one.
02:03:21 Thanks, Asha.
02:03:22 All right, guys.
02:03:23 I think we're done here.

02:04:12 They're real now.
02:04:13 People are all like the tweets.
02:04:15 The tweets are already pouring in.
02:04:16 People are taking pictures of themselves.
02:04:18 They're stylish books and wearing their pins and shit.
02:04:21 It's fucking sick.
02:04:23 I can't wait.
02:04:24 I gave them, they got real nice envelopes.
02:04:27 Did you remember to use the media mail then?
02:04:30 I did not because it said that comic books don't meet the criteria.
02:04:33 What?
02:04:34 They're fucking cowards.
02:04:35 Yeah.
02:04:36 Wow.
02:04:37 You should have just said they were regular books.
02:04:38 I know, but I was scared of the police.
02:04:42 Typical cop killers.
02:04:44 I'm putting out a warrant for the rest of anyone who does not do the following.
02:04:49 When you get your pristine Vapors book, flip to Vaporet for an unantiled Magda Vaporet
02:04:57 by a munchie smiley face.
02:04:58 Turn to the last page and take a selfie with that page in the background.
02:05:03 So take a selfie with that page and send it to me right fucking now.
02:05:07 That's your new homework.
02:05:10 What's your Twitter at?
02:05:11 What's your Twitter at?
02:05:12 Munchie, W, tiny hats.
02:05:14 There you go.
02:05:15 There you go everybody.
02:05:16 You've got all the tools before you now.
02:05:18 All right, that's it everybody.
