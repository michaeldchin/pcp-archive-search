00:00:00 Hello everyone, and welcome back to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's me, BGE. And what's
00:00:06 going on today? We've got Ben Saint around here.
00:00:10 Mmmhmm. That's right. It's Monday. I sure hate him.
00:00:17 It's Sunday, but you'll hear this on Friday. But that's okay. We've got Digibro.
00:00:22 This is a real low-T intro right now.
00:00:25 Yeah, you're right. I'm on Hormone Blockers. What can I do?
00:00:29 I'm making a transition in my life, if you know what I'm saying. And we've got Munchy
00:00:35 and Hippocrit as one horrible hydra.
00:00:38 Poke. You poked me.
00:00:40 Oh, check out this visual joke. Isn't this funny what I'm doing with my hands right now?
00:00:45 Oh, dude. Oh, dude, check out this sign language I'm doing right now. Read this out loud.
00:00:50 It says I'm a big fan.
00:00:52 Oh, no. They want to be able to bear for it. That's not the case. The only Hippocrit
00:00:56 would see me because he's in my house. And by my house, I'm in his house. All the houses
00:01:01 are my domain once I get my claws into them.
00:01:04 I hope the adoption papers go through soon. And also the disowning of Digibb happens soon
00:01:12 in his family. And then you are in England.
00:01:14 What you're hearing right now is actually a lie, by the way, because when you're hearing
00:01:17 this, this will no longer be the case. So this is a snapshot of a bygone era that you're
00:01:23 hearing right now, where I'm sitting inside of Hippo's house right now.
00:01:28 What's like looking at the sun? You only see the sun from seven, eight minutes ago because
00:01:34 of the speed of light. It's when you look at the cosmos, you see the universe, not as
00:01:40 it is, but as it was many light years ago.
00:01:44 Are you fine right now? You're slurring your words. You didn't know what discord was. You
00:01:48 didn't know how audio connections worked. You didn't know how voices or speech worked.
00:01:53 And you're trying to learn how they are on the fly right now recording a podcast. It's
00:01:57 like you handed like an extra treasure, like, hey, make some audio content, make some like
00:02:01 40 hour audio book right now, and you're handing it to a fucking alien who doesn't even know
00:02:05 what a voice box is. This is what listening to Ben speak and think is like.
00:02:10 You know what I'm excited for? I'm very excited to hand oblivion the Gibb Munchie audio track
00:02:16 and have him untangle them and separate them manually into two separate audio tracks so
00:02:21 that he can sync up the flashing independently. Oh, I forgot about the flashing put them in
00:02:28 one avatar together. That'll be fine. No, it'll be fine. Oh, you just one slightly larger
00:02:34 square. Yeah, right square like Steven Universe Fusion. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Oh, cut diagonal
00:02:43 like Gibb Munchie Gump Gump. The rest of this podcast, they are, we shall not think of them
00:02:48 as separate people, but as one entity. Exactly. We are the same. We have the same opinions.
00:02:53 One. I really love that race that I'm thinking of right now that you can also understand the
00:03:00 one I'm referring to because you have my same brain. Yes, the white. What's in it? Oh, no.
00:03:07 I propose Muncho Crit. Muncho Crit. Yeah, that's good. That's good. We've just been the whole
00:03:11 podcast talking about things that have happened to us. So you guys are just like peripherals.
00:03:16 Oh, I gotta tell you, I'm most interested. I would love to hear what you guys have been
00:03:20 up to. I think you had like a meetup going on. I haven't followed it closely because
00:03:25 I'm too important, but I would love to hear it. Before we jump straight into them, we
00:03:30 should do at least one little topic. So here's what I thought of right before the podcast.
00:03:35 How do you shit? I want to know how everybody shits. You know, fascinatingly, there was
00:03:41 a voicemail asking this very question that did not make the cut, but I guess he's getting
00:03:46 his wish nonetheless. Because I don't know about you guys, but the way I shit has evolved
00:03:51 a lot over the years. Let's do our quick poop craps, Donators, you know, intro. Welcome
00:03:57 everybody to the Poop Craps, Donators podcast. Pleasure to be here as always. I have shit
00:04:02 the same way since I was born, but I'm recently trying to curb my unhealthy shitting habits.
00:04:09 You said that you shit too long. Do you take too long of a shit? So here's the thing. When
00:04:16 I was younger, I too took way too long on the toilet, like 30 minutes usually. I knew
00:04:22 people who took 40 plus. Apparently, I'm taking 30 seconds tops. So what I've read is, you
00:04:33 know, that whole gut bacteria autism thing I was bringing up before. I had already heard
00:04:39 about the connection between gut bacteria and autism because apparently people with Asperger's
00:04:43 take too long to shit. And it's a general problem. And I think that, I don't know, maybe I developed
00:04:50 the proper gut bacteria later because it no longer takes me very long to shit. In fact,
00:04:54 I go in there, I shit all the shit out, and I just sit there for a while because I'm still
00:04:59 reading the manga chapter that I'm trying to read before I get out the toilet. Or people with
00:05:03 their phones. But I think a lot of it is like, I think when I was younger, I just was never sure
00:05:10 I was done. It's like you are done, but you just sit there for like 20 extra minutes because you
00:05:15 feel like they're supposed to be more. You know, the worst one is when you've done like the main
00:05:23 shit that you came in there to do, but there's a potential like another one down in the pipeline.
00:05:28 And you're not sure whether you should strain yourself to get it out while you're here or
00:05:33 wait until it needs to come out later. I'm going to tell you right now, my piece of advice to
00:05:36 anybody who has this problem, just get off the toilet. You can come back. That's true. That's
00:05:41 the right way to handle that situation for sure. It's very, very rare that that extra one is actually
00:05:50 going to be able to come out anytime soon. More likely once you get up and you walk around a little
00:05:56 bit, it'll shift around and you'll realize you don't have the shit actually. You don't need it.
00:06:01 You don't got to wait. This is another one of the many arguments that I constantly mock you behind
00:06:06 your back for. And it's the extended sequence of Digibro realizes and presents as new information
00:06:14 that which everyone has known for decades. And this is an ongoing series that I'm constantly
00:06:20 fascinated by. And I enjoy every interview. You can know it. It's not like you put words to it in
00:06:25 your mind. I mean, I suppose so. I'm literally like certain if this podcast had come out like
00:06:33 three years ago, it would have been like, whoa, dude, shred, like speedrun shred. Maybe.
00:06:42 You have to understand, Nate, that what's so appealing about the internet is that people who
00:06:48 have been completely left behind by society can gather and take notes about what's actually going
00:06:54 on in the world together. That's fair. I see the appeal there. That's like, I've never talked to
00:06:59 anybody about how they shit before. I was just taking too long on the toilet. And then one day
00:07:04 I read an article or something that's like, Hey, don't take too long in the toilet, you'll get
00:07:07 dysentery. And I'm like, Oh shit, I better start quickening up my poops. And then I start reading
00:07:13 studies that are like, Oh, Asperger's tied to taking too long to shit. And I'm like,
00:07:18 well, maybe this has something to do with it. You know,
00:07:21 you know, this is just an area that I'm very sensitive to because I feel that a lot of my
00:07:25 videos, I'm extremely concerned that I'm just saying things. Everyone's heard a million times
00:07:29 and are super boring. But I'm saying it anyway, which we all are. There's no new info. Nobody
00:07:35 is ever on YouTube who is going to be grudge having to hear something they've heard before.
00:07:39 It's like all YouTube is. I mean, you're right. You're absolutely right about that.
00:07:44 But maybe that's just my resentment to the, I mean, we all agree on this. Like,
00:07:48 I think about this a lot that the information that you come across on YouTube,
00:07:52 like these are not the experts. These are not, these are not people ahead of their field. These
00:07:56 are basic bitch observations about the world. And I suppose I feel a sensitivity and a bit of
00:08:01 shame at that fact. I think about that so often because I've gotten so far down like history
00:08:09 holes where like the popcorn historians that get like thousands upon millions of views on YouTube
00:08:15 are just like nothing to me to the point where I can't believe it was even made. Like someone like
00:08:22 had the idea to like not, not even just recite history, which isn't even history. It isn't even
00:08:28 interesting. And what's the word inherently, but they just had the goal to just, you know,
00:08:35 recite it word for word, but also to do the thing where, you know, I have to cut it down to 10
00:08:39 minutes. So it's just like skipping over lots of information, like stuff like that where it's,
00:08:43 it's so boiled down from an actual interesting thought. Like it actually, you know, you have,
00:08:48 you have like the deep level shit, you have like audio books and real,
00:08:51 horse storyography shit. And then you go up to the YouTube where it's just like so
00:08:56 polished down to like absolutely nothing that it is wasting your time.
00:09:00 You know, I feel like there's a, maybe it's some sort of inverse of the Dunning-Kruger effect,
00:09:04 but there's got to be a graph that charts like, like general interest in a subject matter that
00:09:09 peaks super early on with like the basic facts and like the further you go into like becoming
00:09:14 an expert, like people's interest or willingness to commit to learning more goes like exponentially
00:09:19 down as you get further and further out. I think that's just, I think that's just the Dunning-Kruger
00:09:24 effect. Well, I mean, that's a different effect, but I see your point. I have to ask, did you get
00:09:31 into history through videos like that? Yes, I did. I won't lie. Yeah, there you go.
00:09:36 See, there is use for that. I think that's the main purpose. Like I view YouTube as a
00:09:41 gateway drug to more interesting stuff. I completely agree. I don't want to
00:09:45 besmirch. I, you know, I don't want to like make it seem like I'm really angry at them,
00:09:49 even though I am constantly, I click on them and I think, oh, maybe this one will be good.
00:09:52 Ah, God damn it. It's always weird from the perspective of like being either, either a creator
00:09:58 or a fan because like the, there's always new people and it makes it confusing because like
00:10:05 for me, I always used to view like, okay, my like main channel is like the basic bitch stuff that's
00:10:11 like just meant to introduce you to the concepts and then you get sucked into like the deep lore
00:10:16 stuff that I do otherwise. But like there's always new people to be hit with the basic
00:10:23 bitch stuff. And so it's like, I have to keep repeating myself because those people are not
00:10:28 going back four years and watching, you know, my video explaining the concepts I'm talking about
00:10:33 now. So I still get questions. That's just what, that's just what most people cap, like guys like
00:10:37 Jeff, not to even, this isn't even an insult, but he clearly is appealing to that demographic
00:10:41 as his primary focus and you know, wise, wise. I get stuff like that even like on this show
00:10:46 where I forget the specifics and if it comes back to me while I'm talking, I'll mention it,
00:10:50 but there was a PCB episode where I was discussing like a topic that I had been
00:10:55 brewing and stewing on for a while. Oh, it was, you can't waste too much time chasing perfection
00:11:01 in art and it's very to have released something than not to have released something and just
00:11:04 put it out, just put it out, just put it out. And I said something like the tale, I said that
00:11:08 sort of like condensed aversion of the idea, the sort of like, you know, good art, you know,
00:11:14 technically impressive art isn't valued by said that on a PCP recently. And someone came in here
00:11:19 saying that like, um, like there are of course reasons to have technical art and like
00:11:24 a technically impressive art and like, yeah, duh, like I didn't think that I had to express it
00:11:29 because the, because this point had been discussed on RFCK and even on previous PCP episodes and
00:11:35 just two people in the circle. So I didn't even think that it was necessary to say it to people
00:11:40 in PCP, you know, the audience, but I guess it makes sense. Like maybe this is someone's first
00:11:45 episode, maybe these tuned in on episode 300 and fucking thousand and they want to get
00:11:50 on the lowdown. Or even they just forgot because they're dumb. Yeah, that's true.
00:11:54 That's true. Like I have people in my audience all the time who like,
00:11:58 who I'll be like, didn't you watch this video? And they're like, yeah, but I forgot.
00:12:04 And again, like, again, it's like, I don't really want to shit on them. It's just like,
00:12:10 like, what am I supposed to do? Like say the entire point from the beginning? I mean,
00:12:14 which makes sense in like a neutral context, but we can't just like stop the podcast right now to
00:12:19 explain the nuance of every single thing that we're saying. I think, I think there's a level of
00:12:23 which, like if, if it goes without saying for you, and it's not like completely ridiculous,
00:12:30 like if most people get it, then it's fine to just to, to say the thing, assuming that most people
00:12:36 get it, you know what it is, the initial context, but and just ignore the people who don't because
00:12:41 they'll eventually get it. Yeah, we're, we're talking about the difference between being a teacher
00:12:45 and being a scientist right now. Like a teacher is somebody who takes information that science has
00:12:51 discovered and repeats it over and over again every year to a new group of kids. A scientist is
00:12:56 always trying to find new information. They are expected to already know every piece of information
00:13:02 that currently exists as they pursue others, which is why those people, you know, are sequestered
00:13:08 into academia, where like you have to pet, like, well, you know, in an idealized way,
00:13:13 what academia is supposed to be is you pass all these trials to prove that you know everything
00:13:16 going on, and therefore you can think about what comes next. But you, if you, you know, stop off
00:13:23 to be a teacher, it's just repetition. And I think on YouTube, a lot of us are trying to do both at
00:13:28 the same time, like we're on a journey of self discovery, like the stuff we're talking about,
00:13:34 it's not necessarily that like we know everything, you know, we might do research projects and
00:13:38 stuff like that. But it's more about exploration of the self and the science of understanding the
00:13:44 environment around you. And then again, you have to go and teach that to your audience. But
00:13:50 it's like you're more excited about doing the science role, but you have to stop and do the
00:13:56 teaching role if you want to keep those people, if you want people to be able to keep up with you
00:14:01 basically. Yeah, okay, Mr. Philosopher, let's get back to shitting because I didn't get to say
00:14:05 what I wanted to say about shitting, like large shits out your a**hole.
00:14:10 I just wanted to say about the teaching thing. It's funny how like on YouTube,
00:14:17 like the biggest educational channels, the literal teachers, are usually only making videos about
00:14:24 stuff that is like spiritually, not spiritually, but like enlightening to them like new information,
00:14:30 people like Veritasium and Smutter every day and Vsauce, I guess. They're teaching people new
00:14:37 things that they have found and they make the videos in such a way that you don't really need to
00:14:43 understand all the science, but they do give you books if you want to read more and like get the
00:14:48 basic concepts out of the way so that you're on the same page and you know, they do it.
00:14:57 That's good. Yeah, that serves as a pretty good shitting. It's become so much more,
00:15:02 so much more than just the active shitting to me. It's become like an active part of my leisure
00:15:08 experience where I will put off shitting if I'm in the middle of writing so I can have the release
00:15:13 of taking a sh**. Like the shitting is my break time. It is literally how I experience like
00:15:20 a job well done. It is my reward. I do not go to the bathroom when I have to go to the bathroom.
00:15:25 I do it when it's convenient to trick my brain into like performing tasks that I want it to do
00:15:30 and like punishing it by holding in piss or sh** into the point where I'm able to take a break.
00:15:34 Who's f**king cat is that? Get the f**k out of here. Obliterate. No. Exodia. Obliterate. Send that
00:15:45 tanderlott pony back to the moon where she came from. I will spend like seriously like 30 yeah
00:15:54 like did you say like 30 minutes on the bathroom on the sh** as they call it and just yeah like
00:16:00 did you say just on my phone reading or writing or just doing anything just because that is the
00:16:06 time under which I am free to do as I please and I have not locked my like you know I haven't
00:16:12 turned off my computer manually from a frozen turkey and now I literally cannot turn back
00:16:17 on my computer again. I've taken a sh** from the respite of literally not being able to use my
00:16:21 computer at all. Munchy I'm proud that you're trying to address this problem now because my
00:16:26 cogey who used to share a room with me he just he did not care about how long his sh** took.
00:16:33 He felt like it was he was just really taking long sh**s and he would take his laptop in with him
00:16:39 and watch yeah no movies full films and he would do it in my bathroom because I had my own
00:16:47 bathroom and he was a roommate I do that too and I would be like you mother like every single day
00:16:52 I'd have to go downstairs and use someone else's bathroom because this mother f**ker is sitting
00:16:56 in my bathroom for two goddamn hours out of every f**king day watching whole films and he would do
00:17:02 it at work too and I think eventually I will do one better. I remember many a summer nights
00:17:08 while I was in middle school where I would in order to like dodge like my mom like a question
00:17:13 to me or whatever I would go into my bathroom and instead of like having like the lights on
00:17:18 in my main room so she would be able to see me I just went into my bathroom and I literally
00:17:23 stayed in the bathroom on the toilet for all night six hours plus I've done that most of my
00:17:29 god damn just avoid I mean that just shows a dysfunction I would say there's something wrong
00:17:35 where that is happening well I remember very specifically one time I watched the entirety of
00:17:39 marble hornets well in the bathroom and that was a great experience the ideal scenario to watch
00:17:48 marble hornets. Bathrooms are a comforting place and I used to be I used to feel very strongly
00:17:53 about the bathroom like because I spent so much time in there I always felt like it was a a place
00:17:58 I had a strong connection to I filmed a lot of music videos in the bathroom back in the old
00:18:02 Modal Soul Productions days but these days I just don't have the same effect I view it as
00:18:07 more utilitary it's just like hey that's why that's the place where you shit you don't want to spend
00:18:12 too much time in there you know. Yo I think one of the subjects we're talking around is kind of the
00:18:17 sanctity we feel in the bathroom in today's modern interconnected society where can you have true
00:18:22 privacy the bathroom. Well not if you bring your phone with you. Well okay I mean I mean you have
00:18:28 as much privacy as you want in the bathroom if you just leave it off or what I mean maybe they're
00:18:32 listening to you via apples or I don't know. They are. They are totally with you. They are.
00:18:36 What about the recent kerfuffle about bathrooms where did you hear about this one of my very
00:18:42 favorite streamers Dr Disrespect filming in several bathrooms at E3 and getting it which
00:18:50 is a crime in the state you live in and got banned from Twitch temporarily. Dr Disrespect
00:18:54 isn't actually blockbuster video game champion 1993 or 1994. You know actually Ben I think as a
00:19:03 matter of fact he actually is those two things I think those are one of the two things that are
00:19:07 actually true about his legacy. Okay well I think that's correct. I don't think that well okay I saw
00:19:13 a video. Maybe I'm wrong. Who was it? Was it a gaming historian? I don't know. I watched some video
00:19:19 that talked about because there were two blockbuster championships and we know who won them. Yeah I'm
00:19:25 pretty sure unless he like unless like he pulls off the sunglasses it was me all like one of the
00:19:32 guys who actually won one of these championships like beefed with him like on Twitter. That's funny.
00:19:37 Yeah he's like dude I I'm the blockbuster 1994 video game champion and this asshole is claiming
00:19:43 to be it. What the fuck man. You know we know his name and like you could look it up so that
00:19:47 that could very well be true that could definitely be true but but let's focus on his violation of
00:19:52 the sanctity of bathrooms and you know I I like the guy a lot I think he's real funny it was obviously
00:19:58 a joke but he committed a grave sin by by filming in bathrooms that is a place where I have my
00:20:04 pp on full display to all comers and I'm glad you're saying this honestly this liberates me a
00:20:10 little bit because yeah for for over a decade this is not a controversial position I don't think
00:20:16 dog I think everybody's on I think so too but like I okay so like 10 years ago I came up with
00:20:21 a bathroom rating system and every bathroom I go to I gave it a score out of 10 and I've always
00:20:30 wanted to do bathroom reviews but I'm like I can't really like how can I communicate this
00:20:36 bathroom to somebody without showing it visually and I just I was like I don't know if it's legal
00:20:43 slash I don't have the balls even if the room is empty to get out a camera and record in the
00:20:48 middle it's not illegal in every state you can't do it in California you might be able to in other
00:20:52 states you could just like make sure no one's in there I mean if so who would object as long as
00:20:56 it's legal yeah it just is it feels like to pull out a camera in a bathroom sure sure and who who
00:21:04 even wants these bathroom reviews honestly who gives um well tell you uh Kazi has a friend and I
00:21:11 want to disclose uh the Instagram in which it exists but she has a friend who owns a like
00:21:17 bathroom toilet review Instagram where she literally rates them on a scale from one to ten
00:21:23 and like what you're discussing in your brain is already real and people are doing it right now
00:21:28 it's an untapped market I guess my idea has was not that unique and other people probably came
00:21:35 to the same conclusion is this a popular account I'm just curious is this popular does she actually
00:21:40 write like a like text post or is it just like a picture and a score no no no no yeah yeah yeah no
00:21:45 there's there's well it's not a long-winded like like a video like essay transcript but it doesn't
00:21:52 have to be there's only so many properties that a bathroom can have indeed indeed uh but you never
00:21:59 know okay I want to go back I want to go back to Nate saying that like everyone's already thought of
00:22:05 like the the bathroom scenario and you know how to do strats I want to say that literally you
00:22:11 Nate on the pcp like 20 episodes is the reason I'm trying to cut down on shitting because you
00:22:18 because I said something about the fact that like I like I am on the bathroom for three minutes
00:22:22 and then you get ulcers or whatever you said something effective or hemorrhoids hemorrhoids
00:22:26 yeah yeah yeah you said that and I was like oh shit is that true it is true it is true and I was
00:22:32 my doctor told me you know what you know where I got that information is from an xkcd comic
00:22:38 that I mean it was just a joke but it was a a graph that was showing like cases of dysentery
00:22:44 over the years and it goes from like the 1800s where it's way high up and then it goes down down
00:22:49 down down down and then it suddenly starts going way back up and it says invention of the laptop
00:22:55 yeah yeah I was like oh can you get dysentery from and let's get real let's get real precise
00:23:00 about what's going on you're getting shit in your body the poop is rising in a in a fine mist
00:23:07 or getting smeared around because you're wiping improperly it's getting on your shit and then
00:23:12 entering your body through one of your orifices again and making you sick do you like eating poop
00:23:18 if not don't sit on the toilet too long after shitting get the hell out of there it's gross
00:23:23 don't do it I do it too but I fight it so hard I know I know I can't pry myself off sometimes
00:23:29 this is why I hate I hate smokers so much because when I was in like working in retail
00:23:35 because they always have this get out of jail free card of I gotta go have a smoke and I always hated
00:23:39 my employees who smoke because they could use this anytime I can only say I gotta go take a shit so
00:23:43 many times per day but these motherfuckers get double the breaks with their fucking smoke breaks
00:23:48 why do they get to kill themselves and get rewarded for it motherfuckers get out your candy
00:23:53 cigarettes my head gotta go gotta take a smoke break boy I will go ironically smoke my candy
00:23:59 cigarettes while while leering at everyone with my with my dreamworks face you know every 20 minutes
00:24:04 at work that'll go great as a bonus just a just a little tidbit just a little piece of information
00:24:10 for you that if you think taking a shit feels good that is gay yeah oh well I don't but I don't
00:24:19 think that's possible because I don't believe in the prostate okay well I don't I think anyone that
00:24:25 says they like lies lying yeah what's really you know I don't usually think it feels good I don't
00:24:31 usually think it feels good to shit just for this one day only I felt gay for some reason like
00:24:36 there's just oh my god it felt like I felt extremely gay just for something would you say
00:24:44 that you were gay for a day I think that might be accurate I think that might be wait yeah yeah
00:24:52 I think that's right on the money right there obviously we don't know all the details but
00:24:56 ladies this very day I wake up and I see a fucking a scheduled video I've never clicked reminder so
00:25:04 fucking fast on a on a fucking thing because I bet you guys years ago at radicon 3 I bet this
00:25:11 would never happen I said to you too I said this will not happen to our faith it's too ambitious
00:25:17 you will never do it and I don't know what it's gonna be but Jesus Christ what is that what's
00:25:24 what's about to happen I want to say to correct you real quick Nate because it's not a scheduled
00:25:29 video it's a live stream this is a live concert that you will be able to watch it we're gay for
00:25:36 one day only today exactly oh I didn't know I oh my god that's even better so this is this is the
00:25:44 one you know England concert exclusive you know maybe we should maybe we should literally make it
00:25:50 unlisted after it's gay for one day that's not a bad idea for one dude this is literally like that
00:25:56 one time only Beatles on top of that rooftop event that like only the literally Illuminati was invited
00:26:02 to do or whatever anyone who's listening to this podcast will have missed it so lol yeah ha ha
00:26:09 I there is there is a secret playlist on the pcb of unlisted videos maybe it's there you will
00:26:14 never know you will never tell we'll we'll never I mean it won't be unlisted they're just saying
00:26:18 you would have missed it live well I mean they were saying it might be unlisted which would be epic
00:26:23 meme you know you hear gay for a day and you think ha ha silly as we when we walked in we
00:26:31 walked into the Abbey Road recording studios right and then and then as we walked out we looked at
00:26:37 each other and just started saying gold solid gold gold solid gold over and over increasing the volume
00:26:44 over and over and over again because it was true it's so much more than any of us could have predicted
00:26:50 or imagined and it's actually real and go to the video somewhere if you're able to do so
00:26:58 three hours from right now in my life and that's fascinating yeah uh as as I was just
00:27:05 like an actual explanation gay for a day is a music project uh that me and munchie cooked up at
00:27:11 radcon three well not not me me and hippo didn't make this art the band sleep tight made oh yes
00:27:17 our band sleep tight consisting of us it's it's low buys for the modern age
00:27:22 sleep tight okay sleep tight um we came up with this idea at radcon three we came up
00:27:29 with lyrics gay for a day what would happen if you were gay for a day one day just for one day the
00:27:35 album um the other day like yesterday or two days ahead was finished shot to be gay would you take
00:27:43 it exactly literally yes we have recorded um an album and then we're going to do a live stream and
00:27:50 have that be like the live version of the album yeah and then maybe do like a remastered version
00:27:55 later where like it's actually like good no listen it's good i mean it's good it's good but it's very
00:28:02 like like sleet oh yeah i'm a little i'm almost a little shocked i mean we've been we've been supposed
00:28:09 to keep this under wraps since uh since radcon two we haven't been supposed to talk about one word to
00:28:14 anyone yeah yeah this has been a tightly kept secret a sleeply tightly kept secret yes a trade
00:28:20 secret a tightly slept secret um well it i wouldn't be so ready to talk about it if not for the fact
00:28:28 that like it is done and in the past and not only since that when you're hearing this it will be in
00:28:32 the past but also in the sense that we have already recorded a version so literally if i like die right
00:28:38 now if like both of us die right now the album will still exist so it is literally out
00:28:46 was this at all part of the plan when you went to england and whatnot uh i i'm not not really it was
00:28:52 just sort of like what better time than yeah exactly right now to yeah yeah absolutely fascinating
00:28:58 especially when we are able to enlist the talents of of your brothers who are musical genius genius
00:29:04 yeah the the musical genius and hgb guy who you may know yes the chas uh the chas made that one
00:29:13 road toad's video game that played in rfck one time yep of course of course and and uh a run
00:29:18 away from snakes yes famous uh bail jade video game and a hgb guy is like hgb guy is the best
00:29:25 savage comment responder in the entire world yes he is a hero he's a god damn hero he's communist
00:29:32 a frame he is uh he is neo gay lord nelson in rfck and he is a beloved creature and everyone loves him
00:29:39 i i love that's true like cryptid of the modern age oh and he has a really strange youtube channel
00:29:45 which uh if you like like weird shit that like is no it's like give and take sort of tear like uh
00:29:52 this would not like make it anywhere on youtube content but like much stranger and much cooler
00:29:57 seeing your brother what's what's the youtube is it called hgb guy uh i think so probably there's
00:30:04 kind of corona on there too if you're if you're from way back but right right seeing your brothers
00:30:08 together was incredible because you really are like the manifestation of both of them hippo you
00:30:13 were like like henry or hgb guy is like if you just were fucking hit with some sort of bizarre
00:30:20 like wizard spell and now you're completely off the rails in every way and and and the chas
00:30:26 is like if you were like restraining you got like a like a five to nine well-paying job and you
00:30:31 became a construction worker like normal person and the intersection of those two are you yeah
00:30:38 literally yeah they're they're very cool they are very cool and i like them so anyway sleep tight
00:30:44 gay for a day full album high quality in the past get fucked kill yourself damn oh i can't believe
00:30:50 i live to see the day you know you know going back to the shit you know the the shit conversation
00:30:54 really good but i just feel like the the shit needs something like if i had like an extra like
00:30:59 letter in there somewhere if you know like shit if there was some sort of like shirt conversation
00:31:05 we could be having right i totally forgot i like these i like these glances you're giving me
00:31:10 yeah i don't know what i'm supposed to add to that i wasn't sure if we were gonna use the gay for a
00:31:16 day to transition into you guys talking about you're more than one day of gay together but we
00:31:21 can do shirts for us yeah i know you want to talk about shirts and ben was was winging uh
00:31:27 justly that teespring earlier before we recorded so all right shirts are big news they're big news
00:31:33 in shirtland let me tell you right now there is seven hundred and fifty dollars sitting in my
00:31:38 PayPal right now mm-hmm on the basis of selling about fifteen shirts was there zero before or was
00:31:46 there seven hundred forty nine okay just check you say there's seven hundred dollars because you
00:31:51 sold fifteen shirts somewhere around there well this seems like that's like a thousand dollars
00:31:56 a shirt what are you talking about uh no i'm selling shirts for thirty dollars each okay okay
00:32:06 don't ask me to math that shit out i have however much well some of them were 40 because of
00:32:11 international shipping look okay the cost of producing one shirt like the full cost of just
00:32:18 the production of the shirt before shipping is about five dollars mm-hmm shipping in the us costs
00:32:24 five dollars how much was the device the device is a hundred and forty okay one time that's not bad
00:32:31 at all no that's that's let that's a lot less than i thought and however the result can just use an
00:32:37 iron but uh yeah the results are great they're uh perfect i mean i need to pre wash my shirts because
00:32:44 the first round i did i didn't and some of the graphics got a little scuzzy after being washed
00:32:50 but um yeah so i bought these transfer papers there i you can get a pack of like 16 transfer
00:32:57 papers they're like a dollar a piece basically um but if you buy in bulk you know the price goes down
00:33:02 marginally um one the the most expensive part of the process really is the ink i mean it's
00:33:08 pretty much like a dollar or two per shirt when you consider because printing these things will
00:33:13 shoot through your ink depending on the design i mean my design is really complicated it has
00:33:17 lots of colors in it and it's it's huge but like all told again the total cost of production
00:33:24 of one shirt is like five bucks i can sell them for thirty dollars um you know take away the five
00:33:31 dollars of shipping that's twenty dollars of profit per shirt as opposed to the two to five
00:33:37 that you will get on teespring and people are way more likely to buy them because i'm selling them
00:33:42 like i'm hand making them i'm writing my name on them in uh in paint so like a shirt paint
00:33:50 uh huh so i'm just saying uh this is the way to do shirts like well quick question quick question
00:33:56 fuck spread shirt this is the way to do shirts i hear you but what is the time investment per
00:34:02 shirt uh 20 seconds okay once you got your operation running okay i mean because you you
00:34:08 do have to print i mean if printing one paper can take a few minutes i mean you don't have to do
00:34:14 anything you just hit print yeah and you wait but if you print like a hundred that's just slightly
00:34:18 more work like like an extra click and then it takes a couple minutes for the heat press to heat up
00:34:23 but obviously you would just do them in bulk but you literally to to print this is how printing a
00:34:29 shirt works you take a piece of transfer paper print an image onto it you put that shirt on a
00:34:36 just on the base of the heat press put the design on top of it close the heat press for 20 seconds
00:34:42 open it and you're done like that is it i mean it's literally just an iron it's just a big flat
00:34:48 iron that's easier to use than like trying to you know smoothly because like if you use an iron
00:34:54 it's hard to get it even you know but i mean you can look up a tutorial it's not that difficult
00:34:59 people do it all the time with just an iron but like it's only 140 bucks for a shirt press that will
00:35:04 always give you the same result um yeah i don't know it's pretty fucking easy like the most time
00:35:10 consuming part is just going to the post office uh i mean i was inspired just because i lived with
00:35:15 tom and who of course was doing this for iam games and like seeing how easy it was for him to do and
00:35:21 i had always just assumed that shirt presses were expensive but i overheard him telling ben
00:35:26 that they were like 200 dollars or something like that which i didn't even pay that much to pay like
00:35:31 150 mines perfectly fine um yep yeah as soon as i heard that i was like oh fuck it's only a hundred
00:35:37 you've already recouped that why am i yeah i recouped it with several well i recouped that on
00:35:41 my fucking test run because i initially printed like eight um i just had like i had some papers and
00:35:49 i had just whatever ink was left in my cartridge and i did a bunch of test runs my printer was
00:35:54 fucking up so i had all these misprints but they all looked really aesthetic and cool so i sold
00:36:00 all the misprints to my patrons and uh they were gone instantly it was like i posted a picture of
00:36:05 like eight designs and within like 20 minutes i'd sold them all that already recouped the cost of
00:36:10 the t-shirt press so um yeah all right like the the only unfortunate part is like i can't really do
00:36:17 colors other than white although there are like there's different types of papers you can use to
00:36:21 do different colors i think um but i mean if you're doing something like endless war like t-shirts i
00:36:28 cannot imagine a better way and also part of my inspiration to even do this type of stuff was ben
00:36:34 when he did the vapors comic because when i saw that he shipped them in those cool black envelopes
00:36:40 with like the white writing on them i was like oh that's the coolest thing ever that like i i wish
00:36:45 i had bought that so i could have that presentation you know yeah a little yeah a little trade secret
00:36:51 there um be cool and look stylish all the time no i know personality goes a long way yeah uh
00:37:00 vapors two kickstarter coming soon question mark
00:37:07 hey you know i did have one strong thought about this um uh this isn't to shit on may specifically
00:37:13 it's to shit on you digi but that the very beginning of your t-shirt video that little joke
00:37:21 quote unquote joke that you do of the like focus on may's chest where she's like where are you looking
00:37:28 that was the most reddit tier normie god awful like are you saying entry-level anime quote unquote
00:37:36 joke are you ever seen in my life and i wanted to die are you saying that digi posted cringe and
00:37:42 will lose subscribers yeah namely me namely me i uh so i condemn you for your terrible joke did
00:37:51 i did that just because i had the camera pointed at her tits and then i went wait i'm sure you did
00:37:56 i'm pointing the camera at your tits you should say something about it that would be funny
00:38:00 no you don't acknowledge it you leave it for the audience to have their own thoughts on
00:38:07 yes that's correct that's correct what what what thoughts do you think would be uh would be namely
00:38:12 there look you you guys know that was an awful joke i wanted to die i wanted to i've never seen
00:38:17 you know everyone says digi's not funny blah blah blah i don't even totally agree with that
00:38:21 this was the least funny thing i've ever seen in my entire life i wished i was dead instead of
00:38:25 and that's not even against me it's against you digi you're the man in charge of this joke
00:38:30 and i blamed you 100 i did tell her what to say exactly exactly any treats women like objects
00:38:37 telling them what to do yeah i'm a feminist what did you think about the part at the end where i was
00:38:41 counting down the uh the shirt press that i'm going with thousand what with thousand two was that funny
00:38:47 um well i'm afraid that when i saw this video was 15 minutes long i thought there's no chance
00:38:52 i'm watching all the way into the end of this video i don't even think it's 10 well no no you're
00:38:56 right it is over it's 15 minutes never mind uh okay but i mean you know that's that's fine that's
00:39:03 fine i got my my my bugbear off my back thank god i i don't know what youtube is anymore especially
00:39:09 now that i'm here in the nether world in the in uh just farming meh nether rack and nether
00:39:16 works day and day over in england yet i don't think they have that i know they have nether
00:39:20 portals right now right now i'm jumping in and out of other portals to speak to you like a real
00:39:23 life name right now jumping in and out of everywhere you have to jump out of the nether portals like
00:39:28 in binary code to to you know convey your internet presence yeah that's good that's good uh but uh
00:39:34 you know what we're good at it uh i love right dear jokes so please don't up my plan
00:39:41 max
00:39:43 real um but bin what what do you think i mean i mean apparently shirt prices are uh
00:39:49 cost nothing are nothing and are just more romantic and better okay um well wait at well i
00:39:58 i think depending on i thought it was a big problem it doesn't sound like it reduces the overhead
00:40:04 from teespring by that much wait what what do you mean teespring is the only overhead is only
00:40:09 like 10 bucks per shirt and that includes and that includes shipping wait how much do you make per
00:40:15 shirt uh depend uh about 10 bucks okay because i'm making 20 by selling them for 30 dollars
00:40:22 well we sell ours for 20 so there you go well i mean it's all about how many you're able to sell
00:40:27 and whatnot yeah i mean you know because the thing about teespring is that they have the better
00:40:32 turnover but they also have the shittiest shirts and like they i like i look maybe i'm crazy i love
00:40:39 my classic v-necks that i got from teespring though i think you're crazy my shirts suck my
00:40:44 shirts fucking suck from teespring well you you didn't get the classic v-neck did you i didn't
00:40:48 get the classic v-neck i can't imagine it would always go for the classic v-neck i legitimately
00:40:54 love my classic v-neck you're gonna have a classic fucking no-neck once i whack your fucking head off
00:41:03 i i i i guess i can't argue i guess i can't argue with that i don't know i couldn't care less
00:41:09 about t-shirt quality i've wore terrible shirts for years and years just because i like the anime
00:41:14 logo on them so i don't know that's that's all i need i used to wear i'm really in a need for cool
00:41:20 shirts i really like i have a lot of t-shirts right fine my slime corp shirt i don't know where
00:41:26 it is it's been missing for like a month let me in one fell swoop completely sell you on the
00:41:30 shirt press though because the best part is not the money i make off of it it's not printing
00:41:35 shirts for fans it's not making my own designs and signing them it's that i can just make my own
00:41:41 shirts for myself of anything i want yeah i can just print any random bullshit out of shirt
00:41:46 immediately when i jump to immediately yeah uh because i fucking printed i made myself a
00:41:51 did you guys see my fourth of july shirt no i did i don't think so my god let me send it to you
00:41:57 please here we go it's my miracle show notes show notes um no i should post it in the gross
00:42:01 disgusting audio okay i see it i see you're gonna want to look at this in full size to to be able
00:42:06 to read the text and all the extra stuff but this i for the fourth of july i was like i need a special
00:42:13 shirt so i printed this unfortunately i printed it backwards however thanks to the magic of the
00:42:18 internet you're all seeing it the way it should oh good is that baracko trump hole it's yeah it's
00:42:25 trump trump bomb i literally just googled trump mama and got exactly what i wanted
00:42:33 oh you got the the comic my favorite comic of all time where george washington and ben franklin
00:42:39 smoke weed together and he says get money fuck bitches smoke trees um it's got you know a rainbow
00:42:47 murica with with uh with fucking right i'm gay i dubs on it uh the pansu party quote which i actually
00:42:55 misquoted i wrote the american flag the american flag is an autistic concept it was actually the
00:43:01 original quote is america is an autistic concept and the flag is to help normie's understand it
00:43:07 hmm more nuanced yeah way to way to contribute to the continual degradation of the discourse
00:43:15 yeah uh well forgive you and there's a beer and a well i'm basically sold for my own self so good
00:43:23 job digi yeah this is so i mean that was i can't imagine being able to just like print my own design
00:43:28 which is what i literally just want to do that's what i've always wanted to do yeah like i want to
00:43:33 have a whole wardrobe of like i want to have a shirt that just says i disagree on it every every
00:43:38 time every time i think of a shirt that i want to make that i'm like ah but i'd have to pay it
00:43:43 cost me like 10 bucks it cost me like 10 bucks to make it and order it for myself on teespring or
00:43:50 whatever i guess i could shrink that well i would always make that money right the profit would go
00:43:56 to myself so what i what i would just what i shrink that cost i could shrink that amount if i owned
00:44:02 a tea that honestly that actually would and the best part is that i just had all these materials
00:44:08 because like i'm already preparing to sell a bunch of shirts to fans and then i'm just like hey let me
00:44:12 just dip into my fucking supply here grab one of these larges grab one of these papers print one
00:44:18 for myself fucking wear it on america trump obama that's good uh you know i'm just a controversial
00:44:25 opinion but uh you look damn good in this picture did you look at that thick head of hair look at
00:44:30 that short i gotta tell you let me see look at the vibrant colors of his lips i gotta say very
00:44:36 appealing yeah yeah you do you do hold on i was gonna say why do you look like victor in this picture
00:44:42 why do you just look like you turned into you you're like half victor you guys you you just
00:44:46 went down it looks like someone trump bombed you with victor yeah i need to send you the full
00:44:51 story so this is going to have to go with the show notes as well so before that picture existed
00:44:56 mere seconds before i had you know i i want i had this shirt i wanted to tweet about it
00:45:04 so i took a selfie of myself in the shirt trying to emphasize the graphic so you would
00:45:10 you'd be able to read it so here's the picture that i tweeted initially
00:45:14 yeah okay which is this is like are you familiar with the hideo and kojima memes of uh
00:45:22 it's like that it's like that i don't see it where is it it's in gross disgusting audio links
00:45:27 that's the yeah um so this that was the first picture i posted then may look at his instagram
00:45:34 right here angles angles and filters yeah may was just like oh that looks like shit let me
00:45:40 take another picture where you look good so she just yeah just changed the angle slightly and because
00:45:45 i'm not holding the camera i had all of my body to pose and uh yeah that was just that's the difference
00:45:51 that a camera angle makes fascinating i don't even know okay but the first one shows the shirt
00:45:55 there's no filter at all so it's just uh it's just the camera angle and being a forward facing
00:46:01 camera versus a uh outer camera as you look you look you look you look almost as stylish as
00:46:06 nathan masry founder of garfield eats okay look at tiny mouth true look at just the change of position
00:46:13 makes digi looks so much slimmer like his jawline looks so much more defined his skin is like glowing
00:46:20 and looks like tanned and vibrant which indicates health like his lips are brighter like everything
00:46:25 about that this is this is a fascinating contrast is he single specifically look at the difference
00:46:32 in your beard it looks so much smoother and fuller in the second one it's a different way i'm
00:46:38 blown away by this the first one was taken from a low angle and the second one was yeah from a high
00:46:42 angle which i you know i always make sure in all of my videos that i'm looking up at the camera
00:46:48 because the only way i look good i don't have a very well-defined jaw so like you have to see me
00:46:53 from above to get that definition but um the fact that i look also like 30 pounds lighter is particularly

00:49:36 like i used to always wear just like xls and double xls and shit and so like it never made a
00:49:42 difference but if you buy all large and like stuff that just fits and then you start getting fat you
00:49:47 immediately are like wow i can't wear any clothes now so i have i have a bunch of underwear and a
00:49:53 couple of pairs of shorts that are like ah i can't wear these anymore i'm too skinny but then i have
00:49:59 a couple that are so huge that i'm like these could i could never possibly have worn the i have a pair
00:50:04 of shirts that's like waistband size 42 and i'm like this was this was never this was never me
00:50:11 what was what was going on here i'm just finding a bunch of like oversized shit in my drawer and
00:50:16 i don't know why it's there i could never have worn it our parents just gave us some shit back in the
00:50:21 day i don't know if it fits under that category i don't know maybe yeah maybe boy it would have
00:50:27 had been kicking around for a long ass time if that's the case i i've been orbiting uh fitness
00:50:33 in one particular way and i've been thinking recently because there's going to be a gym
00:50:38 inside my dorm like just literally inside of there you go no excuses yeah yeah i've been
00:50:43 thinking myself oh yeah there's one thing i want to get fit in there's exactly one way and that's
00:50:49 i've always been destined from the day i was born and i've known this fact that i was always meant to
00:50:55 be a barra munchie barra was what was in the universe's plans when i was spawned
00:51:02 and for me to not be a barra specifically a strong fat barra like i want to be fat munchie but also
00:51:10 just to be a barra big man that is what i was meant to be and i i've been thinking it might be time
00:51:16 to achieve it uh yeah specifically but i'm fucking referring to you dumb piece of shit all right
00:51:23 munchie this should be you this is a this is a famous guy from uh let me see this is going
00:51:27 to gross disgusting yeah there it is this is a famous guy from uh fate zero it's alexander the
00:51:32 great in fate style he is he's number one daddy in uh in the fate universe and this should be you
00:51:38 in a few short years this could easily be you sir uh it might be it might be maybe yeah he could be
00:51:45 the next we'll see personality wise you would love him as well i mean he is a great guy all around
00:51:50 and he loves anime and he loves history uh so that's cool i mean he is history he is well okay
00:51:57 why is why is it why is it what does that what does that mean by the way why is he alexander the
00:52:02 great well i mean in fate in fate stay night they summon heroes from the past like fight in modern
00:52:08 day and they just they summon alexander the great and that's him that's you know okay that's him
00:52:13 cool he he trains this little bitch boy uh waver and to be a man coming of a not baby bitch and now
00:52:20 waver has his own spinoff show that just started this season did you know that oh really yeah there's
00:52:26 no is it is it at all good i never actually liked waver that much the first episode's pretty good
00:52:30 i mean it's him like all grown up he's like long haired he's all like i have to be better to like
00:52:35 live up to fucking alexander's teachings and that you know that's pretty cool alexander was so popular
00:52:40 i can imagine a lot of people would be like yeah continue it's almost like like simone kind of
00:52:45 carrying on like comment is like it's just it's presented exactly as that like yeah monchi i can
00:52:51 get into that uh speaking of that um kazzie was here on the fourth of july for our fourth of july
00:52:57 party which was not much of a party but whatever and uh she wants because we have we have a weight
00:53:01 rack in her brain she was telling me about how you guys are gonna have like access to a gym next
00:53:06 year and and uh she wanted to use she wanted to use the weight rack in our basement because
00:53:11 she doesn't have access to one right now so uh yeah we're we're lifting buddies now
00:53:18 can i be on that yeah absolutely oh yeah oh this is perfect yeah it'll be uh it'll be just like
00:53:25 when me and digi used to fucking squat together uh in the garage guys just just when you picture
00:53:31 someone squatting and spotting someone squatting i just i doubt too many people out there have the
00:53:35 visual imagine a man like just bent over knees been ass stuck out as far as it can and imagine a
00:53:40 man literally sandwiched dick to ass right behind him caressing him and making the most you know
00:53:47 ecstasy filled face as you go down and up it's worth that and i never actually like
00:53:51 properly spotted each other on squatting it was not like we just watched the other person do it and
00:54:00 we were just there in case they dropped it and we needed to call
00:54:03 911 there was one time i got stuck down and ben kind of sort of helped me mostly i just kind of
00:54:10 fell to the side and dropped the bar it's what i don't do that whole spotting shit um it's not
00:54:17 it's not my style i know i've talked about this before no you gotta no you gotta stand behind
00:54:22 you gotta stand behind on the bench you gotta hold your hands under the bar like oh it's all you
00:54:26 bro it's all you bro two just for sweet nothing three more three more it's all you i'm not touched
00:54:31 in the bar i'm not touching the bar this is all you this is all you bro one more come on come on
00:54:36 lock those not those elbows out i'm not touching it's all you bro that's what i'm in it for unironically
00:54:42 those things can be helpful uh yeah sure i yeah kind of having a lifting buddy is a good thing
00:54:48 which i've never ever in my entire life had although one time i have uh i was just like
00:54:54 all that's i was the man you would not have wanted ben as a lifting buddy because ben was in the middle
00:54:59 of texting uh his girlfriend in between every single set i mean sure and it's one of those things
00:55:05 where it's like a set only takes about you know 20 seconds but texting takes about a minute and a
00:55:11 half when you're ben yes i like to work out alone uh and i i'm i'm thrilled that that i've had the
00:55:17 ability to do so primarily but uh there have been some times where like i'm benching and i'm i'm doing
00:55:22 a little bit too much and that bar gets down to my chest and i'm like oh no i can't i'm this is it
00:55:28 it is 100 over for me i was a good run uh i will be dead momentarily uh but have you ever had to do
00:55:35 this ben you probably have like sometimes sometimes people will be on it and they'll come and help
00:55:40 you and it's a little embarrassing but i appreciate the gesture but more often than that you do the
00:55:45 little wiggle where you slowly work it down your torso like crushing every muscle as it goes and
00:55:50 you kind of you're able to sit up it's resting on like your little i don't know the the joint between
00:55:55 your your waist whatever and you yeah get out under it the dick yes the dick as it's colloquially
00:56:01 known and uh it's it's a very painful shameful experience but yeah i've done that it sucks it's
00:56:07 not it's not fun it's not fun but just so on the squad anything i was just gonna say that i once
00:56:12 squatted uh i'm probably the strongest man i've ever seen in my gym was a guy i went to high school
00:56:17 with and we were at our we are at the ymca that i worked at in my hometown and where he would work
00:56:22 he was squatting around 500 pounds or more uh he was he's a gigantic man and like he he was like
00:56:29 hey dude i'm about squat would you spot me i'm like a baby in high school what am i supposed to do
00:56:36 if you're squatting 500 pounds i got right up in there i mean because like he can do most of it
00:56:41 obviously it's just that if he needs it he wants a little bit of help which i can kind of provide
00:56:45 so i'm right up on him like dick to ass i'm feeling the strength of a man it's fueling me the musk
00:56:51 is filling my nostrils and i'm feeling true euphoria at this moment as he goes down and up
00:56:56 down it up us grinding against each other oh my god that's when i knew that the greek lifestyle
00:57:01 was the only lifestyle for me um and uh it was it was euphoric simmer down so i can say i have
00:57:08 squatted 500 pounds uh come at me gays i'm stronger than you yep so that's it that's it that was fun
00:57:17 one day i'll make uh i'll make uh one day my son will be there to spot me in the same way and
00:57:22 we'll be bonded as you know blood you you you won't hear any updates on on the munchie bar front
00:57:30 for for many of an episode of the pcp week because i'm gonna be fucking way too doing anything to
00:57:36 even attempt to even know how to begin but i i i will you know what munchie barra munchie barra
00:57:44 is the new storyline i'm gonna commit right here and you know what that storyline may it may
00:57:49 burn up and die and it may become a failure and that's the point of it do you know how unbelievably
00:57:55 powerful munchie barra would be like munchie's already like a force to be reckoned with like
00:58:01 a human wrecking ball on wheels yeah if he has muscles as well like he could probably punch
00:58:07 a building in half like i can't even imagine anything you wouldn't be able to do did did you
00:58:11 i remember i won the first like digi bros like after like you met me the second time at broding
00:58:15 con there was a digi bros reflecting upon the broding con and you're describing as like as like
00:58:20 an unbelievable tank slash a wrestler like some sort of like a bizarre yeah i've always thought you
00:58:26 needed to be a pro wrestler like if you were muscular you would easily be a pro wrestling
00:58:31 personality so you know there's another guy i think it might become real there's another guy
00:58:36 i just remembered about that you should also aspire to be munchie this is this is even more
00:58:40 famous than alexander and it's just it's the uh the husband from full metal alchemist who has a
00:58:46 big belly i was thinking of the same exact yeah that guy yeah that guy is your barra whenever i
00:58:52 think barra i think i think the blacksmith guy from full metal alchemist yeah yeah this is the
00:58:57 ideal this is the ideal right here can you imagine can you literally imagine you can't you can't you
00:59:03 you know i feel such envy i am limited by my genetics you know i've uh i'm of average height
00:59:10 basically i will never be the towering adonis to like a um what's his face uh fucking uh
00:59:16 armstrong no not armstrong uh who's the real life arm's horse nigger that's what i'm thinking of
00:59:22 just the biggest widest man in the planet but you munchie you have you have all the potential
00:59:27 in the world to be literally the biggest man on the planet and you could be you could be
00:59:32 one of the small weak guys from baki the grappler you could be one of like the tiny pathetic ones
00:59:39 on that show you know i was just looking at it like i was going uh i don't know whatever i was
00:59:45 looking at fitness stuff and i just saw like there's like a some fitness youtube guy who was
00:59:49 like a marine or something and there was just a video of him competing against like i think
00:59:53 literally like the winner of like world strongman competition just like this is a guy if you saw the
00:59:59 marine on the street you'd think holy shit that guy's huge compared to the other guy it was like
01:00:04 looking at a child versus an adult that man was so unbelievably jiggy we're talking like like
01:00:10 six nine or something and like probably 400 pounds just a monster and uh that could be you
01:00:17 that could be you and i hope to see it look out very soon munchie shasky's in town that that second
01:00:22 puberty is coming hard and when it hits it's funny it's funny when you watch you watch a basketball
01:00:28 and everyone playing seems normal because their only reference point is each other yeah and they're
01:00:34 all enormous and then you see them like next to regular people next to like the coach or whatever
01:00:38 and you see and they're like like regular people like come up to like their nipples and it's like
01:00:44 okay all right i see what we're dealing with here i accept my role to be genetically removed
01:00:51 from the gene pool you it's true you guys deserve to reproduce and i do not i get it you're king of
01:00:56 the menlets aren't you aren't you you're king of the man no i mean does the future does the future
01:01:01 really have a place for tall people like uh you know we we don't need to be physically strong to
01:01:08 survive anymore and the overpopulation is putting us into denser and denser human clusters do we not
01:01:15 need overpopulation is a myth overpopulation is a fucking i need a little bit of myth god damn it
01:01:20 god damn it i'm well listen when the bombs drop and it's us against us as nature always intended
01:01:27 we'll see who ends up on top and it won't be the guy when the bombs drop anybody who's tall enough
01:01:31 to see over a wall will be evaporated but like there'll be much like in barefoot again us small
01:01:37 people will just hide behind a chest high wall and we'll be fine in a minecraft hunger game scenario
01:01:45 what the with the pcp as the only players who would come out first in a in a minecraft hunger
01:01:50 game specifically well the the the different areas like you already know because we have the arena
01:01:56 so we know who survives that no that doesn't they're guns that no it's a man man e-man just
01:02:02 complete it has to be dominance physically well the the the thing you gotta account for in minecraft
01:02:09 you gotta account for for trickery and and stratagem and alliances which could absolutely form
01:02:15 let's say if like munchie might have a big advantage against like gibb for example but if
01:02:20 like everyone was team gibb and we said we will feast on munchie's corpse then obviously we have
01:02:25 you know the the edge there and we can uh so you know things like that i don't even know if we do
01:02:30 have the edge there i feel like i can imagine just swatting us away like flies like donkey kong
01:02:37 yeah it's like throwing us 20 feet i think munchie could see tomorrow night when we're all shipped
01:02:42 off to the fucking minecraft world to get out when battle royale happens pcp battle royale that
01:02:48 will be our next uh you know thing dude oh okay i'm sure today that's before but there's nothing
01:02:53 i love more than like physically beating someone up like i'm not joking right now we're like trying
01:02:59 to like make a joke that's why you need to be a pro wrestler god damn fighting people it like it
01:03:04 actually makes me feel so good like munchie unironically someone as hard as i can unironically
01:03:10 you me everyone else on the planet should do some type of contact sport like uh like people
01:03:15 really like brazilian jujitsu it's not as dangerous i mean it's really not that dangerous at like the
01:03:20 level that most people do it and the feeling of like there's something so lost in our modern society
01:03:25 of not physically engaging with each other which frankly i think is mad gay it's way less gay to
01:03:30 be all up on your bros and be comfortable like there's a thing of like ooh i don't want to touch
01:03:35 anybody ooh that's uh that's weird and gross i don't ever do it you should people should be more
01:03:40 comfortable with that in my humble opinion i think we're all singing all dancing crap of the world
01:03:45 exactly got a form fight club when i was a kid when i was in like like middle school and elementary
01:03:51 school i used to wrestle with my friends all the fucking time and i want to get way up on top of
01:03:55 them and i would be shirtless and i'd be so fucking fat that i would just like jump up and down on
01:03:59 their chest make them hyperventilate and i would be like oh i win the game and then i would just
01:04:05 like keep on being them even though they aren't even responding to me anymore it was so good the
01:04:09 adrenaline was pumping i was so fucking sweaty and i felt so good because all my friends were just
01:04:14 white twink and i was obliterating them i was reading the world of the of the right ways one
01:04:18 evil seed at a time it was already i was already splattered in blood but my fists just kept hammering
01:04:24 and hammering away uh good time hey uh let me capture it total left turn but uh you feel any
01:04:33 of those earthquakes out there in california munch that i've been oh wait you're not in california
01:04:37 right yeah yeah i'm not yeah yeah shit no i know i know you're referring to be because not only did
01:04:42 my mom text me saying this there's an earthquake but then hippo's mom like a minute later said did
01:04:46 you know there was an earthquake in california uh yeah so i've heard about them uh we get we get
01:04:53 like earthquakes literally like every day it's not a big deal i know when i was in when i was in
01:05:01 california when i was a tutor at astro camp one day i like you know i slept in and then i went to
01:05:08 like fucking like a councilor mess hall or whatever and i'm eating my i don't know my bullshit like
01:05:15 salisbury steak or whatever and everyone's like oh did you guys hear did you guys feel those
01:05:20 earthquakes this morning and i'm like what because i'd always wanted to feel what an earthquake
01:05:24 felt like because i've never felt one but i literally slept through one and uh now i'll never
01:05:29 get the chance when i never experienced an earthquake before no they don't happen they don't
01:05:34 happen on the east coast dude on the east on the east coast never there ain't no fault lines on the
01:05:39 east coast okay wait has anyone felt them besides when i when i went to tokyo i won't i won't say every
01:05:44 night but like to like japan is formed due to volcanic activity due to fault lines is directly
01:05:49 over them that's why it exists i felt them for the first time and frequently at night and i felt
01:05:55 so small and so powerless before the might of the planet moving underneath me it was a very uh
01:06:01 humbling experience but yeah i obviously that they're they're different you know ranges of how
01:06:06 powerful earthquakes are yeah but even like the small ones like it literally feels like just shake
01:06:11 your body up and down like your your like head that's what it like looks like to have an earthquake
01:06:16 happen yeah like the entire room and ground around you shakes and things like fall off your
01:06:23 shelves and like things can break you know there was another time like if if it's like a particularly
01:06:28 powerful one like in like like look up like i mean teleporting is famous for earthquakes like look
01:06:33 up like the san francisco and like la uh earthquakes those like obliterated entire fucking like cities
01:06:40 like countless city blocks obliterated you know when i was quick so just wipe things off them out
01:06:47 at my last apartment uh in sincenady um there was uh there was a big flood that i've talked about
01:06:53 that i got into the local news for yeah i know i've talked about that before it was pretty pretty
01:06:56 funny but like and the the car at the bottom of the hill got straight up completely covered in
01:07:01 water there might have been a little of the roof poking out but that car was destroyed and uh it
01:07:05 was fucked up and it just that was such a the the water the amount of water just going by on the
01:07:11 street luckily my car was parked at the top of the hill and it was totally fine but i thought to myself
01:07:15 my car will not survive if i attempt to escape this area therefore all i can do is stay okay now
01:07:21 that that's established the water is slowly rising more and more towards my apartment i will not be
01:07:27 able to escape and it's coming towards me more and more i live on the first floor of this building
01:07:33 the basement is filled with water right now there is no escape and i just thought well
01:07:39 i could die today um and there's nothing i can do but i will just sit here and hope it doesn't
01:07:44 happen and that's exactly what i did and it was fine it wasn't that big a deal but it was that and
01:07:49 like the earthquakes in japan were the two most in awe of the planet and in awe of nature experiences
01:07:55 i i have felt personally and it was sure was fucked up bro i want to live i don't want to die
01:08:00 i wanted to fight but there was literally nothing i could do like fighting the ocean or you know
01:08:04 whatever she was crazy she was crazy uh huh yep yep i don't know yep uh oh you know what i was
01:08:12 gonna say though the earthquake was a missed opportunity i wish i wish i'd felt it but i slept
01:08:16 through it uh you'll get a chance there'll be more chances um uh but but you know what i was gonna
01:08:21 say come out to the san yago conben just come on out dude sounds so hard here he was my theory
01:08:28 though here was my theory on the earthquakes my thought was that this was god's judgment against
01:08:32 anime expo taking place this was my theory because it is uh there's too many humans and it's too
01:08:40 shitty yeah i mean i think you might have ended by now but it's are you sad you missed it i'm
01:08:46 fainting right now oh i didn't i thought you i figured you knew no i i should i should know it's
01:08:53 it's always at the same time every year yeah oh man you know what you missed uh i'm i'm i'm i'm a

01:10:35 to otacon like how i would have liked to do either one of those uh all of us besides did you
01:10:39 will be a brony con yep at the at the at the beginning of next month yo my crazy we uh i've
01:10:46 got tickets uh to brony con we have to get plane tickets and uh and a place we're gonna stay but
01:10:51 we were looking at probably do that today or something but we were looking at arabian bees
01:10:55 in the area and first of all let me tell you guys arabian bees are the way of the future hotels
01:11:00 can literally die and go away forever i don't care about them anymore they're shit they're a meme
01:11:04 they're a fad and they are obsolete you can just you can get like some dude's house he's just out
01:11:11 of town you get a whole fucking house which is full of cool things to touch and look at and
01:11:16 experience and a new family to pretend is your family which i very much look forward to doing
01:11:21 and uh it's it's literally cheaper than like most hotels and it's just better in every way too
01:11:28 it's incredible it's incredible now i hope we'll be able to find one that's like relatively close
01:11:32 and still relatively cheap but hotels are a fucking scam don't don't do them don't do them
01:11:37 abolish them that's what i'm for wait wait give them back to the people i wasn't paying attention
01:11:41 what did you say to do instead of i'm saying arabian bees are great hotels are shit because
01:11:46 we were looking into doing an arabian bee and i was like i don't know because i don't know if i
01:11:50 trust like that in in washington dc but if you're if you're giving them the strength of why in
01:11:55 washington uh i don't know it's just for otacon scary dc is a pretty rough place from what i hear
01:12:02 yeah oh i i had no conception of such a thing i think it's one of the crime capitals of the
01:12:06 country like not like the very center where like the the fucking you know all the rich
01:12:12 white politicians are is very nice but like outside that it's apparently pretty rough victor when he
01:12:17 went to otacon last time gave me the impression that it was uh that it was not so that it was
01:12:23 kind of a janky and scary place in places i mean the con is like literally right behind
01:12:29 the white house it's like fucking a block away yo go say hi to drump for me dude let him know uh
01:12:35 you know let him know he's got my official endorsement that the pcp officially endorses
01:12:40 drump 2020 baby all of us are on board for this right right uh wait who are we telling who are
01:12:46 we're voting for drump fan thanks for signing off don't go away did you know every year every year
01:13:01 poor republicans vote for republican candidates we need to liberate them from their vote so they
01:13:06 don't make this mistake hey uh say is seeing as like every single topic that has been brought up
01:13:15 i have had absolutely nothing to say on anything sure and i feel stupid uh let's talk about like uh
01:13:22 munchie being at my house yes please what's going on sure uh i feel okay so so that there was one
01:13:30 big thing that happened while we were here was it the anifred redemption because i've heard a lot
01:13:34 of stories about this all right it was the anifred redemption i oh is that who that kid was in your
01:13:40 video yes okay so he was in fact like a 10 year old as i thought he is 13 okay um he is younger than
01:13:47 the teen cp god damn it might be more appropriate to say on the rfck about the bean up but i don't
01:13:52 care because we're just gonna talk about it now you know what the pcp needs more good topics or
01:13:56 i didn't talk about it an rfck thing and this is fitting this is fitting that we're talking about
01:14:00 here because this is there's pcb stuff here too it's the redemption of pcp fans in my mind
01:14:07 yeah it is the complete redemption of them as a concept because i was so racist towards them
01:14:11 and you know i still will be because i don't fully trust them i don't fully like trust people
01:14:16 who are just like into the pcp and not into rfck that's just like sort of like weird my brain
01:14:20 doesn't fully comprehend that's even possible of course of course but it made me really understand
01:14:25 that there can be good ones like there are like there's there's some of them yeah it was in the
01:14:29 in in in the mostly rotten patch of pcp fans there are a few good ones yeah it was it was a really
01:14:35 good con um literally everyone there was great and no one was annoying yeah there was not there was
01:14:41 not a single person who was like you know annoying but we couldn't bring ourselves to tell him you
01:14:46 know that sort of person who sometimes appears none of none of them were there with that guy and it
01:14:51 was just a delight the entire time to get some backstory because i feel like it's important
01:14:55 to understand like like the narrative arc of the con because it was you know of course a
01:15:00 rowdy fuckers cop clears con you know it was steep and lore and and lore things in rfck narrative
01:15:06 arc things happen within said con it was like an arg but in real life uh but but you know i
01:15:12 i guess so so wait so so you're saying it was just an arg yeah it was an arg it was a real game yeah
01:15:20 and and and so uh i i nest on the pcb is i mean oh maybe like one or two people will want to come
01:15:25 to this from the pcb and they'll be able to be you know indoctrinated into rfck i thought that
01:15:30 was the plan is that it would be like you know because there are a lot of our european rfck
01:15:34 players you know they're shouting yeah there's magic there's a lot of people i thought would be
01:15:38 coming uh none of them came besides magics and it was like ten hardcore pcb heads you're not gonna
01:15:44 believe this but there was at least one person who was just a knight head oh my god what was he
01:15:50 doing there the most oppressed minority we have to liberate them it's not fair wait when you say he
01:15:57 was just a knight head do you mean that he like didn't even watch the pcb well no he he described
01:16:03 himself as a knight yeah he introduced himself as a knight and he did expect the abuse okay
01:16:10 do you know his name i'm just curious who this person is his is cake okay okay this is internet
01:16:15 handle uh so so so we i post the link on the on the pcb channel people start with loading in with
01:16:23 was it they call him cake my favorite uh my favorite uh huge huge tits uh nsf w twitter artists
01:16:31 that's a god i don't know why you even just said that that's terrible anyway i don't know i just
01:16:35 wanted to plug my boy people started flooding in to the meetup channel and they all these anime
01:16:42 avatars they were saying memes and it was just oh god i can feel my life draining from my body
01:16:48 knowing that i was gonna have to interact with pcb fans and it was going to ruin my entire day
01:16:53 having to deal with like the meme or the antagonistic memers and the anime avatar of wielding mother
01:16:59 fuckers who uh watching pcb it's gonna be a nightmare i was dreading it and of course of
01:17:05 course any freddy it's called out for being the epitome of a pcb fan on this very show a couple
01:17:11 a couple episodes ago and you know i was dreading the entire experience but we get here we unload
01:17:17 and immediately you know there are people who are like oh yeah i'm a pcb head but you know i
01:17:23 had to very least i i checked out a little bit the wiki i checked out a little bit of you know i
01:17:26 joined the server and i read a little bit of orientation and i don't ask for much that display
01:17:32 of at least willingness that curiosity that that that that a gumption inside that entrepreneurial
01:17:38 spirit yeah literally yes they are able to recognize that you know you should at least try
01:17:43 to understand anything rfck that loosened me up a little bit and throughout the day as we
01:17:48 shared our pain our growing pains together all the joys and the ups and the downs that we experienced
01:17:53 throughout the day i became closer to these people and i consider i consider these misfits
01:17:57 these these uh these sicko fans these insane pcb heads who were sucking my dick the entire time i
01:18:03 consider them family you know what they were great they were great that's great beautiful beautiful
01:18:09 by the way i'm looking at this image gift posted of him in uh oh sorry the lord of ghosts and you
01:18:13 know i just know no this is very specific this is the cool lord of ghosts yeah sunglasses now
01:18:18 i just i want to mention ben wedges describing the picture let me finish describing the picture
01:18:23 yeah yeah on on the right is the cool lord of ghosts after the lord of ghosts got a fucked up
01:18:28 i'm in retreat the sewers we in the cool over ghosts he's just vacationing right yeah okay and
01:18:33 and next to next to him on the left is communist a frame who no no relation really yeah uh who has
01:18:40 who who went around all day wearing that and holding a boombox from the 80s that was playing
01:18:45 like radio static and then occasionally you can't inquire me by the way i just want to illustrate
01:18:51 that it was it was so hot that day and the and his hat was so tight that he had to leave the con
01:18:57 early and he threw up on the train back so that's dedication like a true communist way to go

01:21:51 day trackmaster four uh my literal god and son who has left uh the internet to do his own things
01:21:58 but left the internet i mean i just haven't seen him in a while so that was great and of course
01:22:02 of course uh my right hand man and brimstone programmer magix rambage there works in the game
01:22:08 magix by the way excruciatingly german by the way it's you can only see his face because he's
01:22:14 hidden by gibbon takes a nametag but he is like literally like craft work like if you
01:22:21 would condense craft work into like a human being that is him magix it was insane i couldn't believe
01:22:28 by the way magix got me magix uh messaged me about sly moids we talked about sly moids
01:22:35 because he i remember right from the very beginning magix was magix was all on
01:22:39 the sly moid update and sly and like maximizing his sly moid stats so he messaged me about it
01:22:45 yesterday and to talk about like updates and he got me into the new the devs or the new
01:22:52 i didn't realize i didn't realize that development had just like shifted to a new server i thought i
01:22:56 thought i was dead i told the steal a while ago but i can understand that it wouldn't have clicked
01:23:01 maybe i have well you well you told me that the new server was for like testing and i was like
01:23:06 well i don't yeah so i okay but whatever so i'm in there now let me give a quick verbal lashing
01:23:11 to farafrog bro what are you doing being like the kirito of the group get in there and get some skin
01:23:18 on skin contact my dude you should agree but on the other hand he looks like he looks like a little
01:23:24 baby yeah exactly no he wasn't he wasn't actually there this is a component i'll crop this in later
01:23:31 he voted you photoshopped him in yeah okay you know what now i see it now i see it who is who is that
01:23:36 kake made this and he photoshopped the people in who is left at this point the nade head making the
01:23:41 best content to come out of it that's what i like to see my who is who is that ghost who is that ghost
01:23:46 in the pillar that's got to be any friend of course yeah okay and at the bottom of course you
01:23:51 can see that antifred has been unblocked by the administrator oh so so to give more context on
01:23:57 antifred it in his journey so of course he gets called out mercilessly beaten and shackling crucified
01:24:04 on the pc and p in absolute like the passion on display there unrivaled and and so he sets out to
01:24:11 not become the of why i referred him as the epitome of our pc p fans okay the worst thing
01:24:18 that's so sad and and so i joined the surfer i don't trust him so i ban him i banish him immediately
01:24:27 yeah okay and and he says munchie how do i become a ratty how what can i do and i said you have to
01:24:33 prove to me that you're not a pcp head you have to recite to me one event from rfck history at
01:24:40 rfckcon just one that's all i asked for and and and then i'll know that you're not a pcp head
01:24:46 for you know what did he say the can the cancer is it isn't fully hit you and so and so he said okay
01:24:51 i'll do such we meet up in the beginning antifred comes over he says i have i have a speech prepared
01:24:56 and when i do it i need you to hold me up so everyone will hear and i said of course i wouldn't i
01:25:02 wouldn't plan anything other yeah so so it gets later in the day you know we're saving with the
01:25:07 perfect moment and and and we are outside the the british museum in front of like a crowd of people
01:25:13 there like like behind us this is like big public square and then i hold up antifred and you are
01:25:18 able to see the photos and videos of such antifred's redemption where he just reads aloud a a wiki
01:25:25 article that he had memorized about the food shortages the first line the first line of which
01:25:30 is after bin sain raises food prices to ludicrous levels a strike conducted socialism at work ladies
01:25:39 and gents speak speaking of which munchie i've had this idea this past week i i want to like wouldn't
01:25:47 it be great i know i want to make it communism i want to make communism in uh rfck like like i i don't
01:25:57 i was thinking about how i could do it but no no no no shut up i mean i was thinking about ways
01:26:02 that i could do it on on the killers only but i was like well would it be unbalanced i was just
01:26:07 thinking about like what if we like what if we had like uh i don't know some sort of like we just
01:26:12 changed how like killer slime calculation works so that like it was like the average of all killers
01:26:17 or something or like some fraction of the team of like the team slime would like became the functional
01:26:22 number or something or maybe some form of universal basic income where like every killer
01:26:28 about every every newly enlisted killer gets like gets like a stipend gets like a lot of his utopia
01:26:34 inside of surely i think it would be really funny okay and also i literally think it would work and
01:26:39 make the team better and be proof of coming to communism works this is this is a fascinating
01:26:43 point ben because i i just i think i have to say that like if you instituted a policy such as that
01:26:49 i think that you would find an organization that is obviously cut through capitalist immoral
01:26:54 agency such as slime corp just as we theorize what happened in real life if you were to institute
01:26:59 that this corporation would leave slime city if you're going to attempt to co-opt their their profits
01:27:06 and uh i these are these are my profits we're i can do what i want with my slime in the anarcho
01:27:13 capitalist nightmare that is new los angeles we're talking about things that aren't terrible
01:27:17 right now we can come back to terrible things later yeah okay agreed agreed well well i want
01:27:23 but i wanted to do that but then i was like that would be too good literally communism would be too
01:27:29 powerful and it would make the killers so powerful that they could not be defeated you know i would
01:27:33 be completely unbalanced i mean you're the leader of the killers do whatever you want uh that would
01:27:37 be interesting to see i guess what happens you know uh as an experiment if nothing else um
01:27:43 shit i shouldn't have said anything i should have just done it you can cut it out you can cut
01:27:46 this part out tell oblivion well now munchie knows oh yeah uh not now i'll be able to institute
01:27:52 communists and communism dammit you came in this this idea this idea that no one's ever tried
01:27:58 communism is so good i shouldn't have said anything because it's guaranteed to work when we
01:28:03 yeah dammit ben ben saint inventor of communism it's to protect his intellectual property
01:28:11 hey hey ben i i sent you i sent you like audio uh a content after the last episode recorded
01:28:17 did you ever get around to reading listen to that wait you did yeah and you said oh yeah i'll for
01:28:23 sure listen to this uh wait okay sounds like he didn't is the obvious answer let's make a whole
01:28:31 rfck thing wait what was it what was it it was it's like like like history through oh yeah yeah
01:28:37 no i did i listened to all you did yeah yeah did you like it did you like it yeah i did um the most
01:28:45 yeah i actually listened to a bunch of the ones like in between like i listened to the whole
01:28:49 series wait what what is this what did he what did he do so last last episode he was telling me about
01:28:54 this podcast called revolutions yeah he was like i think you'd have some uh interesting bits about
01:28:59 the the russian revolution here yeah i want to i really want to hear more of it i was disappointed
01:29:04 that like the series isn't done yet because i want to listen to the whole thing the most
01:29:08 interesting thing about it was the um the paris communes oh oh do you know do you know about
01:29:15 the story about that well like the story behind it kind i mean i i basically only know what they
01:29:22 said about it in this series and i feel like there's a lot more to it that they know i i i beg you
01:29:28 please let me talk to you about it later this is outside the scope of this episode right now okay
01:29:33 but it's very interesting and it would be and it'd be yeah anyway uh that was that was the most
01:29:38 interesting part and that was what got me i want to know more about this uh yeah i listen to listen
01:29:42 to everything i will tell you yeah yeah uh we'll talk about more later anyway uh and i hold up any
01:29:47 friend he recites his speech and immediately upon him doing so i lay him down i throw him down on the
01:29:53 fucking ground i punt him and then i i unban him from the rice and so now annie fred he is roaming
01:30:00 around the streets of new lestadule city a proud rowdy eager for knowledge and curious about the
01:30:05 history and lore that has come behind him this is how you do it guys this is how you become
01:30:09 this is how you get on munchies good side this is how you become best friends with your god idol
01:30:14 munchie shatski is you just show any curiosity whatsoever and you're fucking all bones of your
01:30:20 body is you even just try to be a good person i will shower you and enjoy and lollipops by the way
01:30:28 even more interesting than that is a fairfrog is annie fred's friend who was whisked to this con
01:30:34 by annie fred and fairfrog has just become a foil to annie fred just because he's his friend
01:30:40 and so now a fairfrog is a huge killer with like like mega slimes only trying to destroy
01:30:47 annie fred's good time well good glad to hear how did that happen that was so on brand
01:30:53 so on brand uh there was the twins as well oh yeah okay the two twins one is a rowdy one is a killer
01:31:00 yeah it's just like all this all this duality going on too much as you can see i'm pretty sure it's
01:31:05 callum and happy callum k64 unhappy yeah they are twins and i don't know if it's communicated in this
01:31:11 photo that you're able to see right now in in the show notes oh yeah but they like look exactly the
01:31:16 same i see in person they looked exactly the same and they sounded the same and they just were the
01:31:21 same person and and yet one's a killer and one's a rowdy just just touch you know just like like
01:31:26 one one leaf blew in a different direction for one of them in their crib and their life was irreparably
01:31:32 changed forever like just like this is butterfly effect in action people completely different
01:31:38 results from the same upbringing and same genetic code it's all it's all about that nurture when it
01:31:44 comes making a rowdy or a killer well it looks like this is a this is an outstanding success of an
01:31:50 event despite it being so many pcp heads yeah yeah but did you make any money oh did you make any of
01:31:55 that sticky icky cashish munchie no we didn't make any money because because we're friends now because
01:32:01 we're friends what was the point i asked you what was out of here oh oh by the way i also want to
01:32:07 reiterate that that this was uh you know on the fourth of july and we were walking around london
01:32:13 and and there was absolutely no reference to it as i assumed there would be you know i didn't
01:32:16 think there would be except for one alone cinema in the london china town and there was a cinema
01:32:23 there that first of all played the room monthly which was cool monthly we used the room so we
01:32:28 should see it sometimes you should anyone but also they were playing team america or i'm sorry
01:32:33 yeah yeah and we stopped in and watch it on the fourth of july in london oh that's great
01:32:40 what i would have done i would have taken you know those little um they're like little rock
01:32:44 poppers that you can throw on the ground and they spark and they do a little like explosions i would
01:32:48 have been walking around london with a bag full of those throwing at the feet of every fucking
01:32:51 lyme i come across going bang america bang america big bang fucking red coats you know then they
01:32:57 say like is that a gun i don't know what a gun looks like is that a gun all throughout all
01:33:02 throughout uh july fourth i was telling michelle like today munchie's doing us proud today he's
01:33:07 taking the fight back to england it's a reverse colonization he's running he's running around
01:33:12 in a powdered wig with a bayonet just stabbing people i mean not even untrue not even untrue
01:33:21 listen this entire trip i've been i've been trying to restrain myself not even a very good job at
01:33:26 because it's just so grass but a graphine to say like oh things are different here yeah uh it's so
01:33:32 much fun and i love it and it's great my favorite parts of the con when they'd be like oh you're
01:33:36 certainly such an american right now i'm like oh i'm different than people in certain ways of my
01:33:40 speech and it's cool it feels it feels good man it's it's interesting to see that's one of my
01:33:45 favorite things about when i went to japan it's just such a fucking i mean it's pretty similar
01:33:50 it's very business capitalistic i don't know fucking go buy two shops do cool things but
01:33:55 it's the culture man we're most of the attendees uh from england are they yes almost exclusively
01:34:01 yeah okay i only magics was from anywhere else in europe i'm pretty sure and where was he from
01:34:05 again we're germany you said right oh no lemontarp lemontarp's from i was gonna say i was gonna say
01:34:10 i thought i thought lemontart was there lemontarp's from from spain okay that's cool that's cool i mean
01:34:16 for them that's like a what like a 10-minute bike ride to get to england as i understand it yeah it's
01:34:20 um that's pretty cool yeah it's just a hop skip and a jump so fucking e you shrinking the dimensions
01:34:26 of the world i oppose that policy but fucking e you making it easier to go on vacation mother
01:34:32 fucking globalist fucking parentheses parentheses parentheses globalist you said it
01:34:39 fucking up the discourse it was it was a great time i mean there's just a thousand and more things
01:34:45 that we could say i mean it was an actual packed event filled day yeah no not even just that day
01:34:49 like the the the other days that we've been spending just doing like time has frozen we've
01:34:54 been doing so fucking much lately it's it's it's felt incredible it's felt really good oh one thing
01:35:01 i want to mention um is that we were doing just before we started recording uh recording something
01:35:07 that i've wanted to do all the time and you brought up which is what we just we were working on our
01:35:11 laptops doing writing things in the same room but not talking to one another and and i was introduced
01:35:17 to this concept many years ago as a child watching autopimp videos autopimp as this person would read
01:35:24 homestuck comics right and voice act for the characters and there was one famous homestuck
01:35:29 comic about dave stealing terezi's panties and then all the homestuck guys wearing their panties
01:35:35 feels good for them the point is is that the first panel solex and i think someone else is like like
01:35:41 decoding on their computer on their laptop on a bed or on the side of the bed and then on top
01:35:48 of the bed is john carcat playing super smash brothers and the idea that you can be with your
01:35:53 friends but then also working while they're playing video games that just is like the
01:35:59 best thing i can fucking imagine that's that's what my entire life right now is me doing something
01:36:05 else while my friends are in the room doing a thing together and me i've never done that before
01:36:11 not it's so it's my favorite thing it's my favorite thing in the entire world it's so good
01:36:18 it's like perfect how was like humans were not meant for such a height man was not meant for such
01:36:23 a height yeah men will tower at the site this is what my whole entire teen years looked like
01:36:28 basically uh digi thank you for it anyway we were doing it and it was great i was able to
01:36:37 just like work on work on in this work coding and hippo was able to i don't know do what the
01:36:41 fucking yeah you know just i'm just writing thinking of of characters and and arcs and acts
01:36:48 and beginnings middles and ends i i speaking of that is like a brief aside um i've i've learned
01:36:55 that like the whole like a story has to have a beginning a middle and an end is like in it like
01:37:01 you hear that and you're like duh but what does it mean and i've realized what it means uh just in
01:37:07 like i put it in words that actually makes sense uh story has a pay a setup uh a suspense and a payoff
01:37:15 if you get rid of any one of those things uh it's not satisfying like if you get rid of the payoff
01:37:21 this the setup means nothing and the suspense is just sort of like well what happens um if you get
01:37:26 rid of the setup uh you're not invested in the characters or something or yeah people are just
01:37:31 doing stuff and you're just watching them do stuff and then they end doing the stuff uh if you get
01:37:36 rid of the middle there's no suspense there's no uh will they won't they um so like if it starts off
01:37:42 like a guy says i have to avenge my father and then he finds the guy who killed his father
01:37:47 like one second later and kills him that would be like if you got rid of the middle uh so uh writing
01:37:54 cool hell yeah i i i realized that if if if a piece of media is missing like something fundamental
01:38:02 is usually one of those three things or is like lacking in one of those departments it's like
01:38:07 yeah that's what beginning middle end means uh is to have the setup be paid off but also have
01:38:13 suspense as to whether they will do it what uh what brought up this this thinking on this particular
01:38:18 subject if anything uh cuz cuz i've been writing like crazy like writing like 18 different stories
01:38:24 like different comics uh you know i'm just i'm just feeling very typey feeling very textual
01:38:31 great sounds like you're shaking off your your doldrums a little bit well there's there's that
01:38:36 i mean i i feel like i'm getting good at good at writing but the the thing that i've come into
01:38:45 like this is like getting me a little bit is i'm not you i'm not really the right man for the job
01:38:52 to write to to draw these comics because i can't draw that well and i would need to take time away
01:38:58 from what i'm doing to get good and i it annoys me that that's the case like i'm writing all
01:39:06 these stories and i'm coming up with these specific types of characters and then i try to draw them
01:39:09 and they look like cartoon stupid stickman it's like ah i suppose i know the feel uh so i'm i'm
01:39:18 looking for artists you know i've been thinking about this is the thought i had recently that like
01:39:23 there's probably so many good ideas for stories that like let me put it this way more people
01:39:30 need to like sell each other ideas and like just or like team up because like there's so many people
01:39:36 who probably think like oh i have this amazing idea for a novel i'm gonna try to write it but
01:39:40 it's like your writing voice doesn't really match the story and it's like oh if you just pass this
01:39:46 to somebody who whose voice would match the story it would be good but because you feel like you
01:39:52 have to write it because it was your idea then you know it's gonna come out like shit and like
01:39:58 in different worlds this is commonplace like you know in the world of music ghost writing is
01:40:03 commonplace you know people um there was just an album that came out of prince songs where
01:40:09 it was a whole album of songs he had written for other people but it was like his original
01:40:13 performances of them um like that he had sent to those people so they could do it and it's like
01:40:18 you know all these major stars who he just wrote songs that didn't really fit his style like they
01:40:24 wouldn't have sounded right on a prince album so he just gave them to people who it would sound
01:40:29 right coming from and it's like they're all majorly successful because they match that person's
01:40:34 style it's like you know i i've had a lot of ideas for stories myself that like i can't write
01:40:40 because just my writing style is it just doesn't match the tone of the story but like it's it's
01:40:46 got some kind of core idea that i want to be communicated that i wish it existed it doesn't
01:40:52 have to be from me but at the same time i don't like trust anybody to be able to deliver on it if
01:40:57 i don't like you know work with someone closely know that they're professional know that they
01:41:01 can do it well and that takes time to investigate which can be a real uh wall in uh in do even if
01:41:07 you're interested in doing that and even just finding people who want to write somebody else's
01:41:10 thing who are actually competent writers you know like yes i've i've had people online like when i
01:41:15 talked about an idea for a story who are like ooh can i try to write that and i say sure and
01:41:20 then they do it and i'm like okay well you know i could have done better than this so like you
01:41:26 know i'd want it to be somebody who was actually good but most people who are good want to write
01:41:30 their own stories you know that's true you know i think a part of this comes from excessive pride
01:41:36 of people feeling that there's no way that someone else could ever do the job that they want to do
01:41:41 100 on their own and i heard a great quote that i'm sure is based on like real actual like i don't
01:41:47 know ancient chinese wisdom or something from avatar i was saying this yesterday but like i was
01:41:52 watching avatar clips of uncle iro the wisest mother fucker whoever lived uh great show 10 out of 10
01:41:57 literally perfect and uh he said an amazing line that like i said i'm sure this has been passed
01:42:03 around for generations and but i heard it from iro in avatar and it was azuko was going on about how
01:42:09 like uh iro was saying like oh you're full of uh you're full of shame zuko you got to get over
01:42:14 this well so that you can like you know shoot lightning or whatever and so it was like i don't
01:42:18 feel any shame i'm as proud as ever and then iro said a genius fucking line that was pride is not
01:42:25 the opposite of shame but is its source only by embracing true humility are you able to let go
01:42:32 of your feelings of shame and this for me was a very profound thing to think about and i don't know
01:42:38 i feel like when it comes to like my content creation as a whole i do think that i'm too proud
01:42:43 on a lot of things and that uh i don't know i that that had a lot of value to me and i think is
01:42:48 relevant to this overall question of like working with other people and allowing others to have any
01:42:53 impact on your work if your goal is it depends on your on your goal is your goal is to be vain
01:42:57 and just make your perfect project and take as long as it takes to be the one who did everything
01:43:01 that's cool if instead your goal is to like produce as much great content in your lifetime as possible
01:43:08 you should definitely incorporate the talents of other people and find ways to do it
01:43:12 uh and not let your pride get the best of you so thanks uncle iro i obviously maybe this is
01:43:17 obvious but i think i've in a way i've done more collaboration than most of us in this group because
01:43:22 i've always had editors you know like i had davoo edit a lot of my videos and like davoo had offered
01:43:28 to edit for other people sometimes and like i know you jesse hippo like all of you like the
01:43:34 editing tossed around the idea well so for you guys the editing is so integral to the process of
01:43:39 even creating in the first place like you have an image of what the finished thing you're supposed
01:43:44 to look like in your mind already for my videos a lot of it is just i just write a thing and then
01:43:50 i look at it i go okay what would i set to this and then a lot of it i have no fucking idea i'm
01:43:55 like oh shit i did not think about how this would look on screen so if i pass it to somebody who's
01:44:01 good at taking a paragraph and figuring out what to show then you know it's perfect so that's that
01:44:09 is what ultimately i plan to do with we agua because i do not make those with a vision in mind
01:44:13 i want to eventually have a editor i currently have uh you know may edits all the manga monday's
01:44:19 videos for exactly that reason it's just like i i just sit in front of a camera and talk about it
01:44:24 she listens to the video anything in like i've also gotten into a style of showing myself on
01:44:31 camera so that i don't have to have images for every single second of the video you know yeah
01:44:36 because it's unnecessary people don't need that much to pay attention they just want enough to
01:44:41 to you know to shake it up so there's some pacing to be able to see the thing you're talking about
01:44:46 people are perfectly happy to watch a video of someone's face talking to them because it's exciting
01:44:54 especially no editing required if it's somebody who is you know interesting to watch or has a
01:44:58 charismatic speaking voice or you have a good set good background you know but like i want the the
01:45:04 images in there just so you have a sense of what i'm talking about so you can picture it you can
01:45:08 know what it is um you know see some exciting stuff and of course again the pacing it helps
01:45:12 with that like if there's an image every say 30 seconds or so then you never feel like you're
01:45:18 just watching a guy talk but like when you try to pack a video with images every single second
01:45:23 it's like some of those sentences just don't have an interesting visual for them you know yeah um
01:45:30 so like then you get those retarded like super literal like and that's what opened the door
01:45:36 image of door slowly zoom in on the yeah yeah i think those are funny sometimes but sometimes yeah
01:45:43 i mean if you're like a jack is boy who like makes fun of that kind of stuff intentionally
01:45:47 i can get way into it but that that's a lampooning that's uh you know so like the way that i've been
01:45:52 doing the the manga monday's videos is like i will record my review you know and then just edit
01:45:59 edit it down give it to her she then listens to it takes notes on like anything i say that
01:46:05 should be visualized then she reads the manga behind because like you know obviously i have to
01:46:10 read it before i do the video she doesn't read it till after watching the video so that she can
01:46:16 just while reading put post-its in the book and uh and then just shoot you know all those parts so
01:46:22 it's like that collaboration it literally cuts the time because if i were to do that like i don't
01:46:28 know what i'm gonna say before i read the book so i can't make those kind of notes i can't sit
01:46:34 there and put post-its in i guess if i was like saying ooh i'll probably mention this but like
01:46:38 i really don't know what i'm gonna say so it's a lot easier for somebody to go in behind me and
01:46:43 that way i don't have to reread the whole fucking manga you know if we both get the experience of
01:46:48 hey we got to read a cool manga i get to work on a different project and not edit this one it's just
01:46:53 all around yeah keep the pipeline going yeah makes sense that's why i like uh working with editors
01:46:58 i mean that was always the appeal of working with divu was that like i you know i could just move
01:47:02 on to the next project while he goes and edits that one i crave that i crave that uh reality yeah
01:47:08 yeah though the way i've been doing uh today's anime is that i just screen record while i'm
01:47:13 watching the shows so that i have all the footage ready and then i just you know sprinkle a little
01:47:19 bit in in the edit but uh those are not like yeah i should do that oh you know what you know what
01:47:27 wait on specifically that uh you know michelle had a little bit of feedback for you on that
01:47:31 specifically and she said that she thought that putting the date was she has watched all of those
01:47:36 i think but she said that it was a little bit off putting to have the dates and for some reason it
01:47:41 feels like it cheapens the experience and she suggested leaving it as just the like the subject
01:47:46 matter and leaving those offers specifically marketing purposes to make the video feel more
01:47:52 whatever so there's your feedback i don't know take it or leave it timeless yeah timeless that's a
01:47:55 good that's a good word for it i i mean i agree that it would make it feel more timeless i think
01:48:00 that the reason i'm doing it is so that i i have this weird tendency that i am overly honest with
01:48:08 my video titles no matter how quickly i try to make them like i want to communicate to you that
01:48:13 hey this is just me reacting to the shows that happen to come out today you know yeah i know what
01:48:18 you mean um and like it also kind of helps with you logically understanding why i'm talking about
01:48:22 these shows in particular you know um yeah there's a there's a that question of like how
01:48:28 quote-unquote honest do i want to be like ideally we should probably make every video we produce
01:48:33 sound like the greatest video ever in the title as some people do and you know the problem is a
01:48:39 lot of people do that and as far as i can tell they really it's not even that they don't feel
01:48:43 shame it's that to them like this is obviously the right thing to do and like why would they
01:48:48 even question that no it is because like i historically i feel like this this strange
01:48:54 sense of like i want to stratify the content so that people know at a glance like if they're about
01:48:59 to click on something that's you know high level or low level effort but most people can't actually
01:49:06 tell the difference and the works against us right the reactions people like if you don't tell them
01:49:12 this is low level content and you let them come to their own conclusions like first of all there
01:49:17 are some people who are going to think something i did spend a lot of time on is low level content
01:49:21 like there's there's going to be people who you know are going to rag on the thing even if i thought
01:49:25 it was good but yeah and then vice versa there's people who just they don't come in with the
01:49:31 presupposition that this is an under underdone video and so they end up enjoying it more so
01:49:38 yeah i definitely agree that putting the dates on there probably does cheap in it i
01:49:43 it would feel weird to me to not do it just because it puts them in order it's basically
01:49:47 like saying like numbering the episodes but um yeah i don't know if they probably are unnecessary
01:49:53 so i mean i definitely debated removing like i put we agua at the end of we agua episodes
01:50:00 and i don't know my whole thought process is is really all about stratifying that content as you
01:50:05 said is like this is we agua it's not that good like don't get excited it's just a we agua episode
01:50:11 there's going to be people who like don't care about gurund laghan and don't care about the best
01:50:17 anime ever video and then you make a we agua about like say mob psycho and like that's their
01:50:24 favorite anime and it doesn't matter that it wasn't as detailed a video that's their favorite video
01:50:28 because it's about mob psycho or yeah because it made a point that they hadn't thought about
01:50:32 and the other video didn't you know yep yep so it's a it's a real it's a complicated dance
01:50:40 so i do think i would say it is in everyone's best interest to just title every video as though it
01:50:45 were as though it were you know completely meant to stand on its own it's not being compared to
01:50:51 anything else yeah yeah maybe this is that pride i don't know it's it's it's definitely that pride
01:50:57 because i that's exactly how i feel like i feel this yeah but again and it has nothing to do with
01:51:02 how i expect the audience to react it's entirely based on my feelings towards the product i will
01:51:08 hamstring my own marketing just because i'm not proud of the video and it's uh it's foolish yeah
01:51:14 yeah anyway fascinating voicemails i guess everybody else is asleep yeah yeah i'm ready
01:51:20 i'm ready uh let's uh what i put that okay here we go how many how many voicemails we got i've got
01:51:26 i've got nine voicemails oh i must say wait hold on wait one second sure i just want to say that on
01:51:33 the subject of manga monday's anime reviews shimibakas akira coming out soon oh yeah oh my god
01:51:40 hey did you guys hear they're making an akira anime that's gonna be more true to the manga yeah i saw
01:51:44 i was fascinating yeah it we i had no idea that it took place in 2019 oh my it does ah
01:51:52 what if akira what if akira was an anime imagine that what if i mean it's gonna be it's gonna be
01:51:59 way quote unquote worse like moment to moment but it probably will have you know more information so
01:52:04 so that's cool i don't say as somebody who has read the manga like yeah the movie is amazing as a
01:52:09 technical showcase the manga is a much more interesting story so i believe i think if they
01:52:16 uh i believe that completely only have watched the movie that movie so good though the movie only
01:52:21 adapts the first two out of the six volumes of the manga what what yeah yeah i gotta read the first
01:52:29 two volumes and then it just kind of skips to the like it incorporates the ending in a different way
01:52:34 into the ending of volume two but the manga goes complete basically after the city gets destroyed
01:52:41 is a whole post apocalyptic storyline that is like the bulk of the actual narrative
01:52:47 damn yeah i gotta i gotta get in on that i'm a mango man i think you only takes a day to read
01:52:54 plow through it yeah it's one of my favorites so so on the subject of the voicemails though
01:52:59 let me just say that things i was feeling a bit of despair last episode you know all voicemails
01:53:05 are shit hashtag uh voicemail lives don't matter but the good news is oh i distinctly better batch
01:53:11 this week yeah yeah i i i forget if it was cake i don't want to misattribute to him and and to uh
01:53:18 out him as an anti a trader and a head but someone at ars k con i believe it was cake the
01:53:26 native head tree yeah yeah says something the effect of it's better when you pick the voicemails
01:53:30 munchies oh that as a badge of honor some native it wasn't cake i'm using your words to to drive a
01:53:36 knife run into your father's heart and you know what that's fine i'll i'll cry later uh let me
01:53:42 just say and you know there was a message from nate's number one fan that okay it was it was
01:53:49 interesting and it was good but the thing is like it's gonna sound weird but like it sounded great
01:53:54 and interesting there was clearly a lot of work into it but the actual audio quality was simply
01:54:00 unintelligible and i couldn't like the microphone he was recording on was way too bad i could hear
01:54:05 like music and like things happening in the background nate's number one fan try again
01:54:11 and fix your audio because it sounded cool so like whatever that was i want to hear it as it was
01:54:16 supposed to sound um and also requiem for a meme called back but i'm not going to play his because
01:54:22 it was way too rambling and a bunch of personal details that like are fine uh he was like people
01:54:27 do this where they'll like call in and try to like follow up when we respond to them they're always
01:54:32 boring you're always boring when you do these like follow-ups on the details i'm sure they're
01:54:37 really important to your personal narrative of whatever but don't even bother because it's
01:54:41 boring and and a lot of people have been asking what makes a good fucking voicemail this is the
01:54:47 answer entertainment value in whatever that may be so just be entertaining and you're
01:54:52 miscellaneous you're about to play a voicemail that was the answer um maybe maybe okay but you

01:58:02 voice grail of an entity you can view it is a google drive word document where we have added
01:58:07 you know several names visible to the public in any way i think it was included in the show
01:58:14 notes at least once does anybody have any idea who is or isn't in the voice grail or is it just
01:58:19 you know what we can do we say we say we say when we add okay oblivion oblivion do me a solid

01:58:51 grail into the word document and a picture of a jail that'll be increasing its production
01:58:58 value by ten thousand percent that's correct all right we'll do that for now um okay next one is
01:59:04 okay okay this one's long we're not going to play the whole thing but it's uh this is an
01:59:08 actually good topic nate is the name of the voice spell okay so go so this is an argument i've been
01:59:15 having with my friends for uh the last few days and i felt like ben because i was explaining my
01:59:21 point and they didn't get it and i would just get angrier and angrier uh my relative like ben
01:59:28 i think it's fucking illogical to believe or to think that because somebody dresses up a certain
01:59:34 way or looks sharp they will immediately and objectively do a better job than anybody else
01:59:42 in the same position just because of how they look like i was telling my friends you know it's
01:59:47 it's completely baseless like there is a societal expectation that certain jobs
01:59:51 demand certain appearances and my point was never that there aren't any benefits to doing that
01:59:58 or that it's detrimental in any way i think just think it's it's illogical and i don't i don't
02:00:05 and your friends sound retarded so easy okay i'm gonna he goes on in that way for a while
02:00:09 that's enough i kind of wanted to hear what he was trying to say is that his friends seem to think
02:00:15 that if you are better dressed you will just do your job better than someone who is not better
02:00:21 dressed and he was trying to really doesn't clarify any more beyond that yeah he was trying to argue
02:00:26 with them that that is not necessarily the case that that's that there there may be advantages to
02:00:32 dressing up but it doesn't mean that you will automatically be better than someone who is not
02:00:37 dressed there are i mean in a job that involves like dealing with people there is probably a
02:00:43 reasonable expectation that you should right but it's not there's no guarantee like there's no
02:00:48 reason to think that somebody who isn't dressed up can't by way of some other methodology that they
02:00:55 have some other technique they know be better at it you know that it might be i mean i would
02:01:01 i would make if you're a guy if you're a guy like trying to sell stuff and like um you're
02:01:07 you're you're you're you know really sharply dressed but you're not charismatic the charismatic
02:01:12 guy is going to win i mean even if even if even if he has a wrinkly shirt and he's like but he's
02:01:17 if he's like the life of the street he's just like yelling and it's really selling you on these things
02:01:22 saying ding ding if you're saying ding ding real loud i mean out outside the context of the job
02:01:29 it doesn't matter how they dress if if i'm like hiring someone for a job i want to see them and i
02:01:35 want to see them present themselves like in a way that is like yeah this is what i expect i have
02:01:40 never seen a better salesman or marketing genius than the shirtless guy standing outside of otacon
02:01:47 and brony con that guy is not dressed up at all in fact he is wearing less clothes than most people
02:01:59 dude no he's dressed for the job he wants yeah i would have to agree he's dressed for he's dressed
02:02:04 for success in his field have you ever heard there's a legendary moment in are you guys familiar
02:02:09 with internet historians videos um there's a moment i believe it's um dash con uh the the tumblr
02:02:17 meetup where uh there's there's a guy filming and there's just a moment where he goes up to a man
02:02:21 dressed as the devil and he goes up and he says to him famously sir so what made you want a cosplay
02:02:27 as the prime minister of israel and the the devil replies back well i always heard growing up that
02:02:32 you got to dress for the job you want and that was one of the most legend like this was at dash
02:02:38 con i was expecting a pure cringe i got legitimate comedy gold so shout out to that guy that guy
02:02:45 that guy really nailed it also uh israel's not a legitimate state uh your death israel long live
02:02:51 palestine uh you know you know how it is but anyway um next voicemail uh yes next voicemail
02:02:57 next one is from dj jesse jess oh wait wait sorry i was just gonna say uh on the on the actual
02:03:04 subject of that last one i was just gonna say that the the thing that they're your friends are
02:03:07 kind of right about and i would say is there's a general feeling of when when someone like looks
02:03:12 good socially like i don't know like a girl does their makeup they're like in good shape they're
02:03:17 wearing nice clothes i think it's a signifier of general life i think he knows that i mean he was
02:03:22 kind of saying like i was not disagreeing that it has advantages i'm just saying it shows general
02:03:27 life competence but anybody who thinks in those kinds of absolutes is a moron like that is a
02:03:34 normie way of thinking that is why regular people are so dumb is that they can only see things in
02:03:40 that black and white terms if look you have to make assumptions sometime if you go and you see
02:03:45 a bunch of people and you don't know anything about them but one is dressed nice one is dressed
02:03:50 not nice that is a limited selection of information you have and it's reasonable to make a constantly
02:03:56 changing initial assumption yeah Nate hard agree okay but that's not what did he was saying no i mean
02:04:03 okay it's not everything i agree it it was it was not about like the dressing correctly it's the
02:04:09 fact that if somebody argues a point um and then people assume that that means you're like against
02:04:17 the opposite of that point when you're not actually oh you know okay i guess i misheard or
02:04:21 something like if if you're saying sometimes it's like this and and then the other people like wait
02:04:26 you think it's always like that right right that's what is stupid oh okay i totally missed that i'm
02:04:31 an idiot like like if like if nate says that israel is not a legitimate state that doesn't
02:04:36 necessarily imply anything palestine is a legitimate state yeah yeah none of them we doesn't mean we
02:04:41 shouldn't wipe both of them off the map fair fair um all right dj jesse jess with a voicemail uh
02:04:51 PCP i need your help i recently developed a sexual fetish in which i can only get off when i'm
02:04:56 having sex with someone who espouses political views opposite to mine i've been to so many
02:05:00 trump rallies picking up people my apartment bedroom floor is littered with camouflage
02:05:05 shirts and accessories so much so that when i wake up i think i'm in a literal form when i roll over
02:05:11 half the days i wake up to find a man wearing nothing but a locker up t-shirt
02:05:15 seeing in this block on my cable box which i actually have because i need fox news for the
02:05:20 post-coldest cuddle the reason it's taken a dark return i now can't get off unless i'm in a threesome
02:05:25 with a lefty and a far right winger who are both arguing at each other trying to win the sexual
02:05:31 battle for my political soul i need your help to stop this or reverse this i don't know what to do
02:05:35 by the way been an eight you should hit me up sometime i think we can have a good time

02:06:07 that one munchie next voicemail uh good man suck dick uh go you guys talked about sucking dick is a
02:06:16 straight going let me tell you sexuality is entirely irrelevant a good honest man a true pillar of
02:06:22 his community sucks dick and he likes it not because he's gay though he may be but for the
02:06:29 sheer satisfaction it brings him to make the life of his fellow man more pleasurable goodbye
02:06:35 uh can i just get a hard agree
02:06:42 i saw like a post somewhere of like a it's like a model wearing a t-shirt and like
02:06:48 if you know what i'm saying the back the back of the t-shirt it had like a big picture of an ak-47
02:06:53 it was like it was like in protest of uh you know Colin Kaepernick kneeling for the
02:06:58 national anthem or whatever and it's like the only time this patriot kneels is when he's
02:07:04 sucking a hero comes
02:07:11 damn that's multifaceted i didn't know which way that was going i i i'm like i'm not in i'm not
02:07:18 entirely sure if it's ironic it's hard to tell i mean they could just be like a gay you know
02:07:23 trump or whatever i think probably i think probably but i can't i'm not a hundred percent sure
02:07:27 it's hard to know i don't know not a hundred percent sure like that feels like something
02:07:31 like Milo would wear like he'd wear it relatively unironically but like for everybody else
02:07:37 i just don't know okay all right let's check back in i love the police about like hard
02:07:43 agree being co-opted uh i i feel like hard disagree on that i i feel like that's like

02:11:17 oh wait i just uh hey yeah anything else i gotta delete one real quick just just follow your heart
02:11:22 just follow your heart uh potential uh i would say don't be dispirited if we don't play any individual
02:11:29 one even if you thought it was good i just keep trying and like if it's good it will get played
02:11:33 because there's not that many i play all the good ones basically and it just happens to be between
02:11:38 like five and ten most times i've probably called into biggest problem in the universe slash the
02:11:43 dick show like 11 or up to 15 times over the course of like three years before i finally got played
02:11:50 on the show after i had already been a guest on the show several times it still took me another year
02:11:56 to get a voicemail that was funny enough to get played on the show and then i nailed the formula
02:12:00 and got played twice so nice nice just gotta do one and done as i understand was uh in and out
02:12:10 what a legend all right next one it's a it's an ironic gang weed guy an ironic gang weed guy
02:12:16 let's see what he has to say okay go attention fellow gamers and gang weed members i've heard
02:12:24 past voicemails about one itis quality woman and guy with generic problem number 137 examined
02:12:33 life of gaming gentlemen have we learned nothing from best anime ever tangentopagar and longing
02:12:41 fuck women and honestly just work on yourselves and let an actually good person come into your life
02:12:48 screw the yokos and wait for your nias gamers i have essentially had to give up on veronica
02:12:55 she has been with chat for over a year why even bother with her just because she has huge shits
02:13:03 she probably has a shit personality and has been brainwashed by the government media and corporations
02:13:09 yeah all that matters is being able to say the n word
02:13:18 veronica sounds like a total neoliberal shit so not a fan i would agree i would agree with you on that
02:13:26 yeah man just fucking just fucking wait just wait just hang out just chill out just let don't
02:13:36 don't worry about it let life bring provide you opportunities as you are doing shit to
02:13:40 make your life better and don't ignore them just seize the opportunities when they come to you
02:13:44 that's what most people did throughout history it's not a bad strat and if you feel more desperate
02:13:49 then that's fine devote some of your day to go meeting people you know start well you know the
02:13:53 one thing you can do to make yourself the best you can be is go to go to church start going to
02:13:59 synagogue oh yeah and you're bound to meet the ladies um in temple uh that's what works for me
02:14:15 question reminds me of the number one most pro bully person i know the most pro veronica person
02:14:21 in my life which is michelle uh where as she is absolutely pro bully uh saying various things
02:14:28 like uh those nerds probably deserved it and uh their biggest problem was that they were boring
02:14:34 and uninteresting as opposed to veronica and chad who had more going for them so no wonder those
02:14:40 losers were jealous and you know wanted to be with them because they just don't have as much going
02:14:45 on in their life and you know what hard agree yeah um i want to meet this chad i bet he's not
02:14:53 always cracked up to be oh no he's more than you could ever possibly imagine okay all right whatever
02:14:59 next next call let's go to uh adaptations are always bad okay go so i was recently talking about
02:15:06 different adaptations with my friend like the idea of taking like sequential art such as like
02:15:12 comic and mongas and making into like films and tv series and just from like talking to him
02:15:18 and this is something that i know that i felt in the past he really stressed like this inherent
02:15:23 value of having like a movie or a tv show based on the thing you like and it being good
02:15:32 and it seems to like almost undervalue the actual work itself or the original manga
02:15:39 or comic and i just think that's a really common attitude in like normie culture currently very
02:15:45 much and i was just kind of curious if you guys have noticed this too dude it's yeah if there are
02:15:50 actually any good adaptations of something or superior adaptations that you've experienced
02:15:55 let me say first of all it really can't think about damn this motherfucker just okay he's done
02:16:01 there are definitely good adaptations that the reason people feel like that is that just more
02:16:05 people watch movies the re comics so like more more people have watched like this i don't know the
02:16:11 fucking avengers movies than ever read the comic i have to talk about the so to most people the
02:16:16 comics just don't matter it's a weird and i'm gonna have been abusing this word today but
02:16:20 stratification that people have in their mind of like how much value they put on each different
02:16:25 type of media because like this is why all these fucking disney live actions have been getting made
02:16:31 because normal people just straight up think that like something being live action just is better
02:16:37 than if it was animated like regardless of how well do they enjoy the animated version or not
02:16:43 like normie people like when they hear oh this animated thing is gonna become live action they're
02:16:48 like oh it's gonna be a real movie now like that's how they think of it it's like oh wow
02:16:53 they're gonna make Aladdin a real movie and so they watch it and like really really really why
02:16:59 those adaptations exist is so that disney can keep its stranglehold on the copyright well sure
02:17:04 but it's this is why the people get excited for it like it's why they do so well because they do
02:17:09 i oh this is what dude i'm so excited for black ariel dude i can't wait to pay disney more money
02:17:14 to show me black area that is a that is a hard thing for me to swallow ariel being a ginger is
02:17:19 like the most classic ginger ale such a classic architect that's fucking that's fucking stupid
02:17:25 why but anyway why is that stupid because who because who fucking cares i mean her whole family
02:17:30 is gonna change race now because i mean you know her dad so what guess what the movie's gonna suck
02:17:35 and if you see it you're an idiot regardless of how her fucking hair color is the story from
02:17:39 what isn't it from like grease or something i don't know it's french oh my god my historical
02:17:44 accuracy and my fucking fantasy mermaid it doesn't matter don't look at me like like it's weird of
02:17:49 me to feel like well that's a weird reinterpretation of the character it is weird it is weird so it
02:17:54 what if what if you're the weird would i be weird if repunzel was black like that's such a such a
02:18:00 core feature of the character her long blonde hair why is it so crazy for me to be like ariel
02:18:05 being like a redheaded white dude that's what i do expect that story just would not work if the
02:18:10 hair were black i'm sorry it just it just wouldn't make any sense like i just it would just strain my
02:18:15 suspension of disbelief too much are you being sarcastic are you being serious of course i'm
02:18:19 fucking being sarcastic what the fuck is wrong with you look jesus i mean what is your objection to
02:18:24 my feeling that this is weird is it not weird it is not weird no i don't well i just i i think it
02:18:34 if anyway beside the fucking point uh the the movies are garbage and they only exist because
02:18:40 people think that live action is just inherently better than animation in the same way that people
02:18:44 think that animation is inherently better than non-moving comics people just straight up don't
02:18:50 have a respect for those other mediums because they just see no value in it like they see it as like
02:18:58 oh yeah sure a manga can be good but an anime is automatically better unless it's like obviously
02:19:04 bad you know unless there's something really wrong with it people will always be more excited
02:19:08 but like in my experience most of the time if the i mean there's times where the original
02:19:15 is not good and the adaptation fixes it like in the case of kaon the manga is just not good
02:19:21 the anime is great because they took it and they reinterpret it as like what would be good in
02:19:26 animation um the there's plenty of cases where like the original story was already like as good
02:19:33 as its medium could get and then you translate it to something else but it's not as good as
02:19:37 that medium could get so you end up with something where it's like okay it's theoretically adding
02:19:43 all these extra facets to it should make it have more opportunities to be great but it also adds
02:19:49 more opportunities to fail so if you know for instance um an anime that just came out the
02:19:54 season fire force i love the manga because the artwork is fantastic it's paced perfectly the
02:20:00 images flow into each other well the choreography is perfect and like the anime has certain bells
02:20:05 and whistles that are nice you know you got music voice acting color you have uh like certain action
02:20:12 scenes that are really beautifully animated but the backgrounds look like shit and that's just a
02:20:16 problem the manga never had and now we have that and it's like no matter how good all the other
02:20:21 stuff is the manga was perfect the way it was and the anime is flawed as an anime so if you value
02:20:29 all those extra things just inherently more if you think like oh i don't care if the manga was
02:20:34 perfect it doesn't have color and i just value color above all else then sure you'll think the
02:20:39 anime is better and i think most people think that way as with so many things it depends on what
02:20:44 you value obviously and what about what about akira didn't you say before that akira the movie is
02:20:49 like a better uh it doesn't even adapt the whole story though so i don't i don't i mean i wouldn't
02:20:55 say the akira i wouldn't say the movie is better necessarily in any way it's just a it's just a
02:21:01 really amazing technical showcase of a film but like um the main problem with the movie is just
02:21:06 that it doesn't have the complete story um okay i mean in the case of the akira movie as well
02:21:12 literally the guy who drew the comic directed the film so like it's as close to being the same thing
02:21:18 as it could be basically there are i'm sure i'm sure we could think if we try it of an example
02:21:23 of like a work that was like not like you know an original work that was left that was you know
02:21:30 not as successful and then it was adapted into a movie and the movie was a masterpiece and it's
02:21:34 i mean i think kaon is like oh well how about the godfather there's a godfather book that was
02:21:39 really good uh but they made it a movie and it's like you know some of the most beloved films ever
02:21:43 made that's probably a good example yeah okay um so i mean i would say that like like people really
02:21:49 like the book i've never read it but i have seen the movie and it is like some of the best movies
02:21:53 ever made but does that make it better than the book i'm on record it's just different i'm on record
02:21:59 i think that originality is worth a lot and i think that to us in a certain way the original
02:22:04 will always be superior to an adaptation in just in that aspect um yeah i think it's it's possible
02:22:11 to improve you it's possible to make a superior adaptation uh but it's rare and probably people
02:22:18 should not try well you know the godfather is an interesting example because in the godfather
02:22:25 you can feel because i've watched it so many times i'm well aware that like a lot of information
02:22:29 from the book like didn't quite translate you know a good example is i was always a little bit
02:22:34 confused at the exact relationship of the godfather with um luke brazi who's like the biggest enforcer
02:22:41 or whatever and luke brazi actually has like a a large storied history with uh vito corleone the
02:22:48 godfather and like they barely get into that at all in the movie just enough so you know like what
02:22:54 he is and what his role in the story is in the first movie but i think in the book and i know
02:22:57 in like the video game and other things they go way more into the backstory of that guy and like
02:23:04 so basically information is lost in translation when you're making the godfather movie part one
02:23:09 versus the book but in contrast uh kaon it seems the difference with kaon is that that was a four
02:23:16 panel four coma manga originally mostly comedy not a ton of story what they did instead was they
02:23:22 it seems to me they expanded the shit out of it exactly they added so much more to it and barely
02:23:27 lost anything so it's like in a sense of that like you might be able to make as good a case
02:23:33 as you ever could that like nothing was lost and only things were added and you know there's going
02:23:38 to be people who value the original which is you know because the original was minimal um yeah like
02:23:42 there's like a lot of it is functionally original right material i mean which is yep it'll always
02:23:47 come down to again what you value i mean some people are gonna say they like game of thrones
02:23:53 more as a book some people say they like it more as a series because it is you know what each one
02:23:57 has over the other is so different that you know you could easily make the case either way and both
02:24:04 are good anyway that's enough of this fucking god damn i just i just want to like briefly touch on
02:24:09 like the whole black aerial thing because i've been pondering it in the background okay let's
02:24:14 get into it well i feel like you know i like nate's problem i guess is like
02:24:21 black let's not use the word problem okay it's not a problem it's just like you you say it feels
02:24:26 weird but like yes mermaids and like uh magical long hair doesn't exist like these are fantasy films
02:24:34 so like you can make them the right hair color for like for like marketing you could make her be
02:24:39 black and have red hair in in little mermaid i mean well okay i mean i would say that her being
02:24:46 her having red hair is not like an essential aspect of the character nor is being blonde it's not
02:24:52 but what but what but point taken yeah i mean uh and it's you know i mean i they may do it for
02:24:59 marketing i haven't seen anything of this i mean can i just raise let me cut to the okay you finish
02:25:03 you finish the thing is like the race i feel does not really mean anything in these fantasy
02:25:11 tales because mermaids do not exist doesn't matter what i agree i agree if and the reason it feels
02:25:17 weird is because you know her to be a white person from the time when you watch the original movie
02:25:22 and i'm like the only time a race does matter is in a story about racial differences okay guys
02:25:31 live action remake of the black panther but they're white
02:25:36 oh i mean yeah that's pretty strange pretty strange yeah uh i mean some people were joking
02:25:41 well that would be that would be like i mean that okay i haven't seen black panthers take
02:25:46 this with a grain of salt but i just feel like that would change the tone of the story a lot that
02:25:50 would change the context of it yeah it would probably i mean there there is like there is like
02:25:55 actual like racial i mean you could you could have a theoretical country like that is Wakanda
02:26:01 that's you know it doesn't happen to be black happens to be all white people like but in
02:26:04 africa the story is the same in scotland i mean i suppose maybe you could have the exact same story
02:26:10 but the context the movie exists in would be that's true that would change well let me just
02:26:15 clarify my point here it's just that this has been on my mind a lot like these reimagining
02:26:20 and whatnot because i'm i'm making a weag with it we'll be out by now that's literally about tifa
02:26:24 and how i just don't like how they're making minor tweaks to her bus size and her outfit and this
02:26:29 annoys me as a fan like it's not that they're making like disney presents a new mermaid story
02:26:36 what they're they're literally making little mermaid butt live action now my brain thinks oh i
02:26:42 know what little mermaid looks like oh a black chick well that's not what the originally was there
02:26:47 that feels a little you know that's a change so it like oh here's a question why wasn't bell
02:26:52 funny at all because like yeah the the thing is a little mermaid it's just you know it's a john christian
02:26:57 anderson what's his name is that hans hans christian history so it's been adapted a thousand billion
02:27:03 times aerials looked different in every different adaptation it's only in any way noteworthy that
02:27:10 they made her black because of the fact that they are literally translating the exact movie assumably
02:27:17 because that's what they've done for all the other that's my entire grievance which i mean the thing
02:27:19 is that they all have had this issue as well like how the lion king translated to live action has
02:27:25 the same problem that like using these realistic care animal characters that is some unique issues
02:27:31 but yeah it breaks the movie because you can't characterize them the same way like if you're
02:27:36 doing the exact same movie but now they're they're realistic it's like well okay it was kind of
02:27:43 integral to the original story like banjo kazooie nuts and bolts let me let me ask you this let me
02:27:48 just ask you this okay they made a live action beauty and the beast already we've seen it here's
02:27:51 my question why isn't bel blonde in the beauty and the beast movie why isn't she blonde because the
02:27:58 original had her with brown hair here's my other question why didn't but why does bel wear a yellow
02:28:03 dress in the famous dance with the bc why does she wear yellow dress because she did in the original
02:28:09 so am i crazy to be like let's let's fill in the blank of why is an ariel you know it's just the
02:28:15 same logic it's the same shit would you be would you think it was weird if bel was blonde i wouldn't
02:28:22 i'd be like i would think oh bel used to be brunette that's a change i wonder why they did that it
02:28:26 would be just as easy to make her well the thing is with this is like you don't need to wonder
02:28:31 because it's it's you know good marketing like that's a cool thing to do now to be progressive and
02:28:37 inclusive and represent uh you know minorities in in movies it's obviously a marketing thing
02:28:43 i i just resist i resist this thought that like nates the weird guy for being like well that's
02:28:49 not how that originally was am i taking crazy listen no it's not weird for you to make the
02:28:54 observation that a change was made but it's weird for you to think that it's not good or that it's
02:29:00 like bad do you think it's bad it is bad because it wasn't what what did your film originally
02:29:05 was and why would you think would you think it was bad if bel was blonde yes for the exact same
02:29:11 reason okay i wouldn't i think i just i think that if you took the original little mermaid
02:29:17 movie you could make the exact same movie dude they were if they were black the movie would be
02:29:23 exactly the same nothing would change it's not an essential part of the story so making that
02:29:28 change i agree basically no i mean that's how i feel about making it live action at all
02:29:34 yeah that also yeah there's that you you have to listen when my wiago comes i'm making all these
02:29:39 exact same arguments about the tiny tweaks to tifa's design that everyone says nat you shouldn't care
02:29:44 about these things nat you're you're a dumb in-cell for giving a shit about a female character design
02:29:50 blah blah blah it but but i do care i i liked it as it was why are we and not frankly i'm i'm fairly
02:29:55 attached to aria i fucking love part of your world i've watched a million times i was never
02:30:00 gonna like or watch this but it just i mean you know that's it she could still sing part of your
02:30:05 world she's black nae what what is nothing changes about that song you're filling that in but what
02:30:11 it there's a disconnect in my brain that i don't like and there was no reason to do it so why did
02:30:17 they do it the thing that's a little weird okay well hippo hippo was right i i want to say more
02:30:24 about this you can get i just want to say hippo was right before when he said it like it is for
02:30:27 marketing and it's and it is cynical in a way look maybe it's not even for marketing maybe she
02:30:32 was literally the best one who showed up to the audition i mean but uh you know this is this is
02:30:36 disney it's for marketing everything's from right look the point is right you could uh you can be
02:30:41 like i don't like that she's black you know you can be wrong like that you can be like i do like
02:30:46 that she's black this is great and you can be slightly less wrong but the point is that it
02:30:51 having an appeal the fact that you differentiate between those two shows your true cards ban
02:30:56 you should feel exactly the same about both those observations no you're wrong um but the
02:31:02 like having any opinion on it at all is the point of the decision the fact that people will
02:31:07 feel one of two ways is why they did it like you know disney does it disney makes every move that
02:31:13 they make in order to make money this has stirred controversy i hate that it has stirred controversy
02:31:18 but it has and because of that it will make more money this is getting people talking this is the
02:31:23 plan they knew this would happen they did it on purpose and it's not good or bad that aerial is
02:31:28 black but it is bad that disney is a fucking monopoly a capitalist nightmare that is controlling
02:31:37 your brain and stealing your money movie who cares you care more than i care right here's here i care
02:31:43 about i care about our capitalist oligarchs ruling our ruling our society that i do really how by
02:31:48 making movies what's even the big deal they i mean they've they've shaped the discourse now right or
02:31:53 no they're they're they're capitalizing on it right like i mean they'll continue to they'll continue
02:31:58 to profit off of our off of the fact that we feel so strongly about this by making decisions of this
02:32:03 sort and here's an interesting thought about that and it's just and it just i feel infinitely less
02:32:09 strong about this issue than i do about minor tweaks to tifa's design which i utterly despise
02:32:14 so that's where i'm at okay okay i think um i would argue about that as well the i'm sure you
02:32:20 would not the time if she her original model was like seven polygons they had to change the
02:32:24 design oh my god then listen to my video okay fine i will cover these arguments in extensive
02:32:30 detail okay all right all right i i i here's here's my my thought that perhaps you know this is no
02:32:37 real basis but it's like interesting to think the the doing the marketing gets the money you know the
02:32:44 appeasing crowds that you know like this sort of stuff and it's good to be representing people
02:32:52 because it is unusual and it is like it is a progressive thing in a world where now it's
02:32:59 just normal like to remake something with any race character and it's no longer a you know
02:33:06 a marketing gimmick that disney can do would they stop doing it because it's not as profitable
02:33:11 anymore yes i would yeah probably they would they would they would stop anything if it wasn't
02:33:18 profitable i mean like let's not significantly more profitable the the obvious choice if you're
02:33:24 remaking the little mermaid is you get someone who generally looks like ariel that would be probably
02:33:28 your first instinct you can you can do something else but then you know you've got whiny old
02:33:33 fanboys like me who are just like well why the change this is my question why the change
02:33:38 and you know marketing like you said that's clearly the answer yeah yeah but that would be the answer
02:33:43 no matter what that would be the answer no matter what race ariel was the answer would the answer
02:33:47 why would be marketing um it would be because it would be because it makes the most money that's
02:33:52 that's just the thing that really annoys me about like the representation when it's used for marketing
02:33:57 for money for profit as a no no but everything is used for that it's not i know i know that yeah
02:34:04 but like in a world where people don't actually care and if the situation changes they'll just
02:34:09 stop doing it and then it's it's back to how it was yes you know that's what i don't like
02:34:14 you are on to something here right okay whether like whatever they decided to make area look like
02:34:19 it would be equally cynical like the fact that she they made her black is not more cynical than if
02:34:23 they decided to make either one would just be profit motivated and nothing else the problem
02:34:28 is that disney is able to make decisions like that and like like the fact that they have
02:34:35 like the fact that they can make ariel black and we can all look at that and go oh this is great
02:34:39 thank you disney thank you for representing minorities like you've like you're really helping
02:34:44 right like the fact that they have that power is fucked up if you really think about like the
02:34:49 fact that it means that much to people that ariel is black i don't even think it's bad i think it
02:34:54 but i think it's bad that it matters so much i think that just means that disney just has our
02:35:00 society by the balls and it's a nightmare with a neoliberalist capitalist nightmare uh and then
02:35:06 we live in hell dude hard agree dude hard agree you have a much more pessimistic view of life than i
02:35:12 do thank you okay let's get the hell out of here not to our next voicemail uh by cooking bad cooking
02:35:18 bad okay go i've called in before with a simple message hello fresh bad cooking good everyone
02:35:25 can do it it's literally easy yay but after seeing munchie make ramen i have to renounce
02:35:30 my previous stance boom some people just shouldn't be allowed to cook at all no it's a sad world we
02:35:38 live in and there's really no reason to make it any worse he saw your disgusting peanut but a ramen
02:35:43 and is rejecting it at a visceral physical level wasn't that a uh wasn't that a uh a uh a cluster
02:35:50 punk kitchen recipe yeah i don't i don't know well i guess you found it offensive it was hell no fresh
02:35:57 yeah it was hell no fresh who was in the voice grail for his contributions to the show he was i
02:36:02 think the very first person the voice grail uh well once we i mean you know fucking the real
02:36:08 mass batman was was you know on the on the trail before that but my my audio kind of at the end
02:36:13 did he give a reason why i was bad he did not clarify why he i think he expected to be obvious
02:36:19 which i assume was that peanut butter ramen looks gross is my guess okay it's just it just sort of
02:36:26 looks like a white sauce almost have you it was nice there there is food there is food that can be
02:36:33 tasty and delicious but look like absolute shit right yeah i don't i don't i don't know if you have
02:36:38 this conception dude i don't know if you if you've ever heard of food that looks weird but tastes good
02:36:43 i don't know sometimes you can have food that is just like a brown slop but it's like a robust
02:36:49 umami sense sensory overload uh curry looks in there curry looks disgusting and yeah it's very
02:36:56 i mean it just looks like some brown sauce you know yeah it doesn't look like i mean it looks pretty
02:37:01 gross i'm just saying i'm just saying well fair i'm just saying ugly food can taste good well
02:37:06 well that's that's what i'm saying too and i think that it's on brand for cluster punk kitchen
