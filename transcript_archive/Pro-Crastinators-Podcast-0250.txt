00:00:00 I'm supposed to be working right now, I'm supposed to be working right now, but I'm not working, I'm doing nothing, I didn't got the surgery, I tell my son, I have an asshole, I am so stupid, I gotta get one.
00:00:30 Doomer, we have you on YouTube for my music.
00:00:36 Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, the only podcast on the internet.
00:00:46 This week it's me, it's Ben Saint, it's Gibbontake, it's Tom Oliver, and there's, I was
00:00:59 gonna say Digi, but I guess it's not, what's up?
00:01:03 There's no such thing as a Digi anymore, this Digi character has been put to rest.
00:01:10 I'm just gonna, this podcast I will be known as Trixie, 21st century Trixie old girl.
00:01:18 That was one of my favorite ponies, one of my favorite ponies too!
00:01:24 I guess it kind of sounds like Digi, it's got the same vowel arrangement, it's okay.
00:01:31 That was also part of why I figured that would work for this show, I was like, I'm not gonna
00:01:34 convince you all to stop using the double I sound when referring to me, but Digi, Trixie,
00:01:39 it's not that hard.
00:01:40 Plus it's a character you all know already, so you can just visualize Trixie in your mind.
00:01:48 It's easier to remember than Gray, I think, were you going by Gray for a little bit?
00:01:53 I was Gray for a bit, but that was always kind of meant to be a placeholder name, it
00:01:59 was like until I figure out what name I want, and then for a multitude of reasons I landed
00:02:05 on Beatrice, one of them being that one of its shortened versions is Trixie, so, yeah.
00:02:13 Yeah, this is not an internet handle, this is a real name changer.
00:02:18 Yes.
00:02:19 Yes.
00:02:20 Yeah, okay.
00:02:21 Trixie is one of my now IRL nicknames also, which is nice, because a lot of this was spurred
00:02:27 because the other day I was doing Canton, and Victor kept calling me Digi, and I was
00:02:35 like, you're not allowed to call me Digi, and he was like, wait a minute, yeah.
00:02:39 Why does, oh, right.
00:02:42 Victor's never called me Digi, not even on the internet.
00:02:44 I was gonna say, wait a minute, Victor always called you Conrad at Radcon.
00:02:50 Right, exactly.
00:02:52 Okay, I get it.
00:02:53 So in my mind, I was like, well, you have to call me by my real name, that's how this
00:02:57 works.
00:02:58 So he wasn't calling you Gray, so he just didn't know what to call you, I guess.
00:03:02 I mean, I haven't used the name Gray for a while.
00:03:06 In my personal life, most of the people around I told them Beatrice is my name now, call
00:03:11 me B, Trixie, these are the ones that make sense, you know.
00:03:15 My friends have been calling me B, or Goldie, short for Golden Witch, because I'm also still
00:03:20 using the Golden Witch name.
00:03:22 That's how you change your Twitter handle.
00:03:27 But just Victor calling me Digi, I was like, well, you have to use my real name, goddammit.
00:03:32 He was like, well, Digi's been around longer, and I was like, well, that's a problem.
00:03:36 If you're still thinking about, if you still think of that name because it's been around
00:03:40 longer and not just because it's a brand, then I have to get rid of it, because I'm
00:03:45 not Digi.
00:03:46 Digi is a brand name, you know.
00:03:50 I've killed the brand.
00:03:52 This is so fucked.
00:03:53 This is so fucked.
00:03:56 I think at some point, Munchie thought it expected me to start calling him Anthony, and I can't
00:04:03 do it.
00:04:04 I don't like real names.
00:04:06 I like brands.
00:04:07 Well, you can pretend that Trixie is a brand name, it's just a My Little Pony character.
00:04:12 We're on a My Little Pony podcast.
00:04:15 I think we're moving towards a glorious future where brand names and real names collide and
00:04:19 you can change your real name as easy as you can change your brand name.
00:04:22 I always like calling people by their internet handle names, because that's the name someone
00:04:29 chose for themselves.
00:04:30 I mean, if you want to go-
00:04:31 I always thought that was cool.
00:04:32 If you want to go with Goldie, that's the most internet version of a name that I've-
00:04:37 I'm fine with Trixie.
00:04:39 I'm just saying that I cannot separate branding from reality.
00:04:45 They are one and the same to me.
00:04:47 I like that you can collect a bunch of names.
00:04:50 I have so many names.
00:04:52 I also associate my characters as names I could have by one or two.
00:04:57 It's like a demon.
00:05:00 It's like a demon.
00:05:01 You have all kinds of different names, but you have your true name that can banish you,
00:05:04 but you don't tell anyone that one, because then they can bind you to their will.
00:05:08 Or any fantasy character, like Khaleesi, when she gets up to 12 names by the end of Game
00:05:14 of Thrones.
00:05:15 Oh yeah.
00:05:16 The Golden Witch.
00:05:17 I just want to have that joke.
00:05:18 I want that list of titles.
00:05:19 I want people to-
00:05:20 The first of the-
00:05:21 Yeah.
00:05:22 I want people to be giving it to me, though.
00:05:23 I don't want to just be making up my own.
00:05:26 Stormborn, first of the Great Breaker of Tams, 100,000 Subscribers, um...
00:05:35 Wait, you'll weight plus 100K on you.
00:05:42 Every-
00:05:43 It's like every time-
00:05:44 And she gets a new name every time she goes from like, from like, from, from, from Mere
00:05:50 to-
00:05:51 The name will be official when you hit a million, and it's on the plaque.
00:05:54 That's how you know you're actually-
00:05:56 That's when you know you're really famous.
00:05:58 You get a new one for every platform.
00:06:02 The way I'm planning on selling this name change, uh, is by privatizing all of the content
00:06:07 on the Digi and Digi collective channels.
00:06:10 Bam!
00:06:11 Daaamn!
00:06:12 I'm gonna release-
00:06:13 Privateize.
00:06:14 Yeah, I'm gonna make a video called, you have three weeks, I have a video called, you have
00:06:18 three weeks to archive all of my content, and then it's just gonna be gone.
00:06:22 Whoa!
00:06:23 That's a pretty big one.
00:06:24 Yeah.
00:06:25 Well, that's some crazy shit.
00:06:27 Good, good thing, good thing, uh, good thing there's a list of all that that you may-
00:06:33 Well, I already know that some people who have like, I already know for a fact that it's
00:06:36 all archived up to at least last year, from last time my channel got taken down, so.
00:06:41 There will be people who have saved it all, probably will re-upload it.
00:06:45 I just don't want to be the one hosting it, basically.
00:06:49 But I'm gonna go back and like, recreate a bunch of the good stuff, you know.
00:06:53 Wait.
00:06:54 The HD remaster, the HD remasters coming.
00:06:57 I don't understand what you mean by that.
00:06:59 Project Wholesomeness, right?
00:07:01 No, do that again.
00:07:02 More like, more like if there's videos for that word.
00:07:05 Oh, like, like, Modal Soul Productions, like, uh, Action Adventure RPG, you're gonna like,
00:07:10 remaster-
00:07:11 You have to remaster Madame.
00:07:13 It's the best video you ever made.
00:07:16 How come you don't make Action Adventure RPG anymore?
00:07:19 This is what I followed for, and it's been like 12 years!
00:07:23 Unsubscribe it!
00:07:24 Unironically, I feel that way about myself.
00:07:26 There's a person inside me who feels exactly that way.
00:07:30 How dare you fucking abandon Adventure Action RPG?
00:07:34 All I ever wanted to do in life is play Action RPG's, so, like, shifting gears away from
00:07:39 It was definitely a huge mistake.
00:07:41 I did not want to spend all of my life, you know, analyzing anime.
00:07:45 So.
00:07:46 Agreed.
00:07:47 Agreed.
00:07:48 Sad.
00:07:49 Lol.
00:07:50 I said digi.
00:07:51 You know what I mean.
00:07:52 Yeah.
00:07:53 Yeah.
00:07:54 Yeah.
00:07:55 I didn't even know this.
00:07:56 I did.
00:07:57 Me either.
00:07:58 It's a weird process for all of us.
00:08:00 Yeah.
00:08:01 To get used to.
00:08:02 Yeah.
00:08:03 It's a gay world.
00:08:05 Yeah.
00:08:06 That is true.
00:08:08 Tom, you were like musing on Twitter about changing your name from Tom Oliver.
00:08:13 That's right.
00:08:14 I was thinking about that for a good while now.
00:08:17 That's so fucked up.
00:08:18 Yeah, I know.
00:08:19 I don't know if I'm going to do it.
00:08:20 It's so fucked up.
00:08:21 I don't know what I would even change it.
00:08:23 Do it.
00:08:24 Do it.
00:08:25 Do it.
00:08:26 Do it.
00:08:27 Let's all do it at once.
00:08:28 Let's all do it at once.
00:08:29 You're all doing this to me.
00:08:30 I'll just abuse that you're all doing this to me.
00:08:31 Well, okay.
00:08:32 Ben, you're just jealous because you picked the perfect name from the start and have nowhere
00:08:36 to go.
00:08:37 Yeah, that's true.
00:08:38 You will never top Ben St. It's fucking incredible.
00:08:41 I am jealous of my own perfection.
00:08:44 It's true.
00:08:45 Thank you.
00:08:46 Oh, this is so nice.
00:08:49 Oh, well shit.
00:08:52 You flattered my name so now I can't complain anymore.
00:08:56 It rolls off the tongue really well.
00:08:58 It's good.
00:08:59 I know.
00:09:00 I don't know.
00:09:01 I don't know.
00:09:02 Maybe Tom should use the name Ben St. I think that would be a pretty good one.
00:09:06 I'm a little jealous of like, I was watching a, oh fuck, I was watching a video by The
00:09:13 Right Opinion.
00:09:14 It was about the Nikocado Avocado guy who I'd never heard of, but I was watching this
00:09:19 video just to have something to listen to, explaining like his drama or whatever.
00:09:24 And like the story of his drama within the mukbang community is like, it's like, he keeps
00:09:31 referring.
00:09:32 It's like every time he makes a video explaining like, explaining the latest tea or whatever,
00:09:37 his story is like, oh, you know, I have to publicly call out what, you know, and like
00:09:44 everyone has the stupidest names like everyone's called, I don't know, like, like, like, I
00:09:51 don't know, a fit, fit raccoon, fit raccoon buster, you know, 12, 18 or whatever.
00:09:58 I'm writing that one down.
00:09:59 That's a new candidate.
00:10:00 I'm referring to each other with deadly seriousness, like real people, but with these like, these
00:10:04 outlandish screen names.
00:10:05 And I'm like, my screen name is just a, is a regular human name.
00:10:09 I'm like, mmm, some, it's a little unfortunate that I'm not like, I don't know.
00:10:13 I have a good excuse for you, Ben, because.
00:10:15 Yeah.
00:10:16 Patreon.com slash Ben St. was a classic meme that's, that's for the ages.
00:10:20 It's rolls off the tongue, but subscribe star.com slash Ben St. doesn't roll off the
00:10:26 tongue the same way.
00:10:27 So if you ever need to open a subscribe star.
00:10:29 You can come up with a new name just for the purpose of a better and a second meme.
00:10:34 I don't know what I'd need to open a subscribe star for.
00:10:37 I mean, it's just Patreon again, right?
00:10:40 Pretty much.
00:10:41 But like, yeah.
00:10:42 I have some people who are like, I refuse to use Patreon.
00:10:45 Right.
00:10:46 Make a subscribe star.
00:10:47 And I'm like, okay, but I hate subscribe star.
00:10:49 It's really bad when you use it as a secondary thing and you're small because it's like,
00:10:54 hey, because I only have like three people who are just like, I refuse to use Patreon.
00:10:58 So I'm like, okay, I made a subscribe star.
00:11:00 And the subscribers are like, hey, we won't let you take any of the money until you have
00:11:05 at least five people.
00:11:06 And so I just had like, I'd like, yeah, I had like $400 just sitting there for like,
00:11:10 wait, that is a number of people.
00:11:13 That's really weird.
00:11:14 You need at least five subs before they'll take your month.
00:11:17 They'll let you take the money out.
00:11:18 What the hell?
00:11:19 Take the money from those less than five people.
00:11:22 It's really dumb.
00:11:23 So yeah, for like a year, I just couldn't take the money out until one of the people on
00:11:27 there was like, I'm just going to make two more accounts, give you a dollar, let you
00:11:30 withdraw it and then I'll move back over to Patreon.
00:11:32 I'm just like, okay.
00:11:33 At some point I would have just been like, like, just go to your Discord and just be
00:11:37 like, hey, somebody please make a subscribe.
00:11:39 I didn't realize for a while because like, not only does it do that, it won't automatically
00:11:43 charge the people on there.
00:11:45 If you have under five, so every month I'd be like, hey, people on subscribe star.
00:11:49 Just a reminder, it's that time of the month because it won't auto do it.
00:11:53 It says it's to prevent fraud.
00:11:55 I'm like, what are you fucking talking about?
00:11:57 It's so weird.
00:11:58 Yeah.
00:11:59 So unless you end mass, tell people to go there.
00:12:01 Just just laundering my money through subscribe star.
00:12:04 Right.
00:12:05 Subscribe star sucks if you're tiny.
00:12:07 That's unfortunate.
00:12:08 But onlyfans.com slash Ben St still sounds good.
00:12:12 Ooh, that's the power of right there.
00:12:16 That's the end goal.
00:12:17 That's the inevitable end goal and we all know it.
00:12:20 Wait, have I talked about only fans on here at all and how it's like the best?
00:12:24 I don't think so.
00:12:25 No.
00:12:26 Because what's great about only fans is you can just upload video to only fans of any
00:12:33 size and they don't have content ID.
00:12:36 So the negative side is they take 20% instead of 10%.
00:12:40 But other than that, they host your content and the way that the feed is on only fans
00:12:46 is just a Tumblr feed.
00:12:49 It looks exactly like Tumblr and it's like you can post images or videos or text.
00:12:55 You have those six options like Tumblr had.
00:12:59 It's just fascinating that it's a good social media site in a way that Patreon completely
00:13:06 failed at trying to be and also a great payment processing site because there's no content
00:13:13 ID, no content restrictions at all.
00:13:14 It's mostly for pornography and you can upload video to it.
00:13:20 There must be because they take such a large cut because I didn't like using only fans
00:13:25 for that one time.
00:13:26 I was making like punk eludes and that was funny.
00:13:32 But they take quite a lot and for doing drawings, I'd rather not spend so much time for such
00:13:39 a cut of my pay.
00:13:40 I probably wouldn't think it was worth it if not for the video uploading ability.
00:13:46 It sounds like if you can upload the stuff elsewhere, then it's probably better to do
00:13:52 that.
00:13:53 But for whatever reason, you can't just host it on YouTube or whatever and subscribe.
00:13:57 Sorry, it's a good alternative.
00:13:59 Only fans is still a better deal than a YouTube subscription.
00:14:03 It's also just a great way to release bonus content because on Patreon, you still have
00:14:08 to upload your bonus videos to some other site and then have an unlisted YouTube video
00:14:15 or something.
00:14:16 That's true.
00:14:17 That's true.
00:14:18 That's annoying.
00:14:19 On only fans, you literally just upload bonus content.
00:14:20 Only the only fan subscribers can ever see it.
00:14:22 I think the goal for 2021 should be to reclaim only fans, take it away from the ethos and
00:14:28 make it for everyone.
00:14:29 Yeah, I completely agree and that's what they want.
00:14:31 There's nothing on the only fans website that in any way implicates its meant for ethos
00:14:35 or sex work.
00:14:37 It's just a payment site just like Patreon.
00:14:39 It just happened to originally be run with ethos.
00:14:42 The savior we wanted this whole time has been right there.
00:14:45 I will say it does have the one thing that it has that kind of facilitates parasociality
00:14:52 because it has like a built-in odd DM system, but people can also just give you straight
00:15:00 tips and donations like one-time tips and they will.
00:15:04 People who have already subscribed to you will just tip you money on individual posts.
00:15:08 It's pretty cool.
00:15:09 It's a great infrastructure.
00:15:10 I'm just saying.
00:15:11 That's pretty fascinating.
00:15:12 I had no idea.
00:15:13 I had no idea it was that well-built.
00:15:14 I don't know what I would put on it because I don't make any new.
00:15:24 Also Tom from MySpace told me to use it three years ago and I didn't understand what he
00:15:28 was trying to tell me to do.
00:15:29 Damn.
00:15:31 Like personally?
00:15:32 Yes.
00:15:33 Tom Anderson.
00:15:34 Remember when I talked about being DM'd by Tom from MySpace?
00:15:38 He was telling me that OnlyFans was like the most interesting alternative to Patreon,
00:15:42 but he was like, oh, it's mostly for nudes or eat.
00:15:47 I thought he was telling me that he was using it mostly for nudes, so I was very confused
00:15:54 why he was telling me this.
00:15:55 Why was Tom from Facebook DMing you?
00:15:58 Because of my videos about Patreon being not great.
00:16:01 I had made some videos about how I thought like he was like, oh, if you looked into the
00:16:05 alternatives, though, and I don't know if he has some kind of stake in OnlyFans or if
00:16:09 he was just investigating it at the time, but that was his suggestion to me.
00:16:13 That's what he's been working on this whole time since to follow MySpace.
00:16:15 He's like, I can just capture that ethod audience.
00:16:18 That and his big-ass Instagram.
00:16:20 Right.
00:16:21 But yeah.
00:16:22 How old is he now?
00:16:24 He must be old now.
00:16:26 He's in his 40s, I think.
00:16:31 Too old.
00:16:32 Yeah.
00:16:33 Too old.
00:16:34 Come back to me again when he's 60, and he's a cool old guy right now.
00:16:37 He's just in that middle space where like, I don't care.
00:16:42 Yeah.
00:16:43 I agree.
00:16:44 Okay.
00:16:45 Well, that's good.
00:16:47 I was having a productive week, but then I started a world-ending Noida run, the ultimate
00:16:55 Noida run.
00:16:56 I am a god gamer of Noida.
00:17:02 Noida stands for...
00:17:06 It's finished for which.
00:17:08 You play as a hooded weirdo, and you do alchemy, and you create wands, and I have the best
00:17:15 wand now.
00:17:16 I do...
00:17:17 Okay.
00:17:18 When you're just playing the game, when you're an idiot, when you're one of your
00:17:23 rube, like I used to be, the game is like a progression from level to level, trying
00:17:28 to beat the final boss.
00:17:30 When you ascend to the next level, when you become a god gamer, Noida becomes a resource
00:17:37 management exploration game wherein you are collecting a lot of spells and creating a
00:17:47 layer somewhere.
00:17:48 I open steam, and it just shoves Noida directly in my face.
00:17:52 So there you go.
00:17:53 Holy fucking...
00:17:54 Didn't even have a new game?
00:17:55 There was just a strange coincidence.
00:17:57 It's just on sale, I think, right now.
00:17:59 Yeah.
00:18:00 It's 25% off.
00:18:01 Well, people should buy it.
00:18:02 I have not gone to the moon yet, but I went to hell yesterday.
00:18:06 I finally got to hell.
00:18:07 That was pretty difficult, but I managed it.
00:18:10 Had to use lava to blood to turn this lava sea underneath the final boss into blood and
00:18:17 dig down for a while to get to the boss.
00:18:20 Kind of like Terraria with better graphics, a really cool part of cool effects.
00:18:24 I went to a parallel world that was really hard.
00:18:27 I had to use sand, I had to use ground to sand to change the rock walls on the side
00:18:33 of the world to sand, and then I had to dig through them and create pockets of ambrosia
00:18:38 and use a teleport bolt to teleport from puddle to puddle of ambrosia so that the cursed rock
00:18:43 in between worlds wouldn't kill me, but I did it.
00:18:49 I've killed some more bosses, killed a bunch of bosses I've never even seen before.
00:18:54 I don't know.
00:18:58 I just want to gush about Noida, but I know most people haven't played it.
00:19:01 I really like the aesthetic of its title, its text.
00:19:05 Yeah, pixel art with the dithering.
00:19:08 It's good.
00:19:09 I have talked about Noida before, so I won't go on at length, but I will say that the dithering
00:19:13 is that way because the game is based on falling sand game-style particle physics.
00:19:20 I remember seeing previews for this game, now that I'm looking at it, and the aesthetics
00:19:27 of it and the monster design and the names of everything are based on Finnish mythology,
00:19:34 and it has an alchemy theme to it, which is pretty...
00:19:41 Okay, this is funny, this is fun.
00:19:44 Because I needed ambrosia to cross between worlds, because the parallel worlds are separated
00:19:51 by a huge rock wall, the center of which is cursed rock, and to get through it I was using
00:19:56 a spell called ground to sand, and firing a projectile and the projectile's path would
00:20:00 turn the ground to sand, then I had to dig through the sand, but the cursed rock would
00:20:04 hurt me, so I had to make dig holes and put ambrosia in it, so I had to get lots of ambrosia
00:20:09 in order to put pure ambrosia in these holes, so I went to the fungal caverns and I had to
00:20:16 dig a hole and I had to find... I didn't have any ambrosia, so I had to go and find puddles
00:20:22 of spilled ambrosia from potions that I had broken throughout the rest of the game, go
00:20:26 down there with my own bottle, scoop up as much as I could, go back to this hole that
00:20:29 I dug, throw in as much ambrosia as I could but along with all this other crap, and I
00:20:33 had to find materials that were denser than ambrosia, or lighter than ambrosia, to throw
00:20:40 in with it so that the ambrosia would sink to the bottom and the lighter fluids would
00:20:44 float to the top and then the lighter fluids would leak off the top, so I would be left
00:20:49 with pure ambrosia that I could then scoop up into a bottle and take to the wall between
00:20:52 worlds and put in these holes for me to traverse between them, and it was so cool and satisfying.
00:20:59 I was like, I figured out how to do that all by myself.
00:21:02 I feel like a real alchemist, doing chemistry.
00:21:07 Wow.
00:21:08 Brilliant.
00:21:09 Wow.
00:21:10 Okay.
00:21:11 I can't visualize it, so I'm not impressed.
00:21:15 No.
00:21:16 In fact, you suck.
00:21:17 Okay.
00:21:18 Yeah.
00:21:19 Okay.
00:21:20 I'm sorry.
00:21:21 I apologize for doing all that.
00:21:22 Well, everyone just needs to play Noida so they can understand what I'm so excited
00:21:27 about here.
00:21:28 If you play Noida for like 100 hours like I have and then you're like, okay, I will
00:21:32 undertake the task of traversing to a parallel world, then you will come back and listen
00:21:37 to this podcast and you will appreciate, wow, the process Ben is describing sure is tedious,
00:21:42 but I can see how it would work and I wonder if I could do it myself and then you'll try
00:21:45 it and you'll die.
00:21:46 You'll die like I almost did because you'll fuck up going from puddle of ambrosia to puddle
00:21:50 of ambrosia and the curse will activate and you'll start to bleed slime because you took
00:21:55 the slime to blood perk and then all your slime will explode out of you and it'll get
00:21:59 all in your ambrosia puddles and then you can't touch the, and then you've got to use
00:22:02 your teleport bolt.
00:22:03 Oh God.
00:22:04 We've got to get back to the world before I die.
00:22:07 The game does sound pretty cool and is on sale for $15, but for only $9 I could get
00:22:13 the Bayonetta and Vanquish combo.
00:22:16 I don't even know what that, I don't even know what Vanquish is.
00:22:19 Vanquish is pretty fun.
00:22:21 Yeah, Bayonetta and Vanquish are both on the computer now after years of people wanting
00:22:27 it.
00:22:28 Wow, the personal computer.
00:22:29 Everything's coming out to fucking PC.
00:22:30 They just announced all of fucking Kingdom Hearts, which I don't care.
00:22:33 All I want is for any commenters, if you've played Noida and you appreciate, if you appreciate
00:22:39 all the, how tedious and difficult what I just described is, give me a, I don't know,
00:22:46 just say, then just say, just give me a gold star and chat in the comments please.
00:22:52 Thank you and goodbye.
00:22:55 Shout out to Daniel Desalt or at Lasership84 on Twitter who did the cover art of the Vanquish
00:23:01 and Bayonetta PC release for the US and it also is designing me a VTuber.
00:23:07 Oh my God.
00:23:10 Wait, so you're getting rid of old content and you're going to be a VTuber now?
00:23:17 I'm not going to exclusively be a VTuber.
00:23:18 Well, okay.
00:23:19 I will have a VTuber.
00:23:20 So you're going to, what are you going to do?
00:23:21 You're going to play your games?
00:23:24 I, you know, I just kind of figured having a VTuber would just be good for every conceivable
00:23:31 reason.
00:23:32 It is pretty cool.
00:23:33 I think VTuber, VTuber Trixie is going to be a great time to revive.
00:23:38 And powerful time.
00:23:40 A great and powerful time to revive Gamecube forever because I still get comments on IMGames.
00:23:45 Gamecube forever going to keep going.
00:23:47 I'm like, I don't know.
00:23:48 It's not my project.
00:23:49 Don't ask me.
00:23:50 Yeah.
00:23:51 Oh yeah.
00:23:52 Gamecube forever.
00:23:53 If there's any video gaming project I would continue.
00:23:57 That would be the problem.
00:23:58 That and Tales of Tales of, I still, I get asked about it all the time.
00:24:02 Tales of Tales of is one where like I kind of don't see myself finishing it unless more
00:24:06 of the fucking older games get translated because not all the ones that I wanted to review
00:24:11 have been, and like there's no effort that I could find at the time at least to finish
00:24:16 them up.
00:24:17 I was thinking of doing like series in that vein on Game Series.
00:24:22 I'd actually want to play, but I'm lazy and I haven't done it yet.
00:24:26 It was either going to be Discussing Disgaea or The Legacy of Legacy of Cain.
00:24:30 Those are two games, series I'd like to go through.
00:24:32 Well, I mean, you'd have to play like 300 hours of Disgaea.
00:24:36 I know.
00:24:37 That's what scares me because like I don't even know if I like the games.
00:24:40 I just look at the art and I'm like, the art looks pretty cool.
00:24:42 And that's all I know about them.
00:24:43 So do you like tactics games?
00:24:45 They're pretty fun.
00:24:47 I'm sure I'll have fun.
00:24:48 I just don't know.
00:24:49 Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.
00:24:50 Yeah, it was a great game.
00:24:52 Okay.
00:24:53 It's like, I would say like it's along the lines of that kind of going into battles.
00:24:58 Yeah.
00:24:59 I just don't know if I have, you know, like 5000 hours to actually do all that.
00:25:02 The biggest problem with the Disgaea games and a lot of the Niponichi games is that the,
00:25:07 there's like, you want there to be way more cut scene and story and there's not very much.
00:25:14 I don't know.
00:25:15 Maybe you'll feel different, Tom.
00:25:16 Are the guys who made Disgaea, right?
00:25:17 Correct.
00:25:18 Yes.
00:25:19 I really, really liked.
00:25:20 Oh, okay.
00:25:21 I must have missed the name, but I really, really liked Disgaea.
00:25:25 And then I think before Disgaea 2 was out, they had Lapusel Tactics was out and I thought
00:25:32 Lapusel Tactics was lame as hell.
00:25:34 That game is too fucking slow.
00:25:37 So that was, that was actually their first game for the PS2.
00:25:40 Yeah.
00:25:41 But I think it was released second in America or something like that.
00:25:43 Yeah.
00:25:44 It was.
00:25:45 I think it was off the success of Disgaea that they started releasing their other games.
00:25:48 I have all the old Niponichi games and fucking Lapusel is like the amount of time it takes
00:25:54 for every turn to happen is just like preposterous.
00:25:57 The game takes fucking forever and it's, it's unplayably slow in my opinion.
00:26:01 I don't care if the mechanics get interesting or whatever.
00:26:05 It just takes too much patience.
00:26:07 They fixed all that.
00:26:09 Have people seen, have I talked about the pictures of me cosplaying as Master Lammington from
00:26:16 Disgaea at Anime Boston in like 2006?
00:26:20 I've never seen this.
00:26:21 No, it sounds super mythical.
00:26:22 I'm not, I'm not going to find them, but anyone who has stalked my old Facebook is from,
00:26:26 or MySpace or whatever, we couldn't find, like they're on the internet.
00:26:30 I look like a fucking dweeb, but yeah, I have these huge wings that my mom helped me make.
00:26:36 Incredible.
00:26:37 And I, I, you know, Eleazar, I don't know, I'll try and, I'll try and find the picture
00:26:44 somewhere.
00:26:45 And if I find it, throw it up here, I guess, okay, okay, even though it's, it's embarrassing
00:26:52 and I got my stupid, my stupid long high school hair and I look all stupid and shit, but
00:26:58 that's okay.
00:26:59 That's right.
00:27:00 That's a photo next to it of, of Nate with the, of the Empire Hunter D hat, and it all
00:27:04 balance out.
00:27:06 He was, he was, he was dressed as a Vincent Valentine from Final Fantasy 7 at that Anime
00:27:12 Boston that year, so, well, I mean, his, I think his costume was a little less embarrassing
00:27:18 than mine just because it's a character people actually know.
00:27:20 I don't know.
00:27:21 But he had the claw and everything.
00:27:24 Okay.
00:27:25 Okay.
00:27:26 I just wanted to bring, bring attention to that to embarrass myself.
00:27:28 Excellent.
00:27:29 Excellent.
00:27:30 I really wanted to love all those Nipponichi games because of A, I wanted to, I, when I
00:27:36 was younger, I really wanted to be good at tactics games because it would mean I was
00:27:39 smart and I was not smart, so I was bad at them.
00:27:42 So I owned a lot of Tagnus games and never got very far in any of them.
00:27:46 But like, other than that, like the characters looked really cool and like were aesthetically
00:27:51 interesting, but most of the cutscenes are just like goofy nonsense that kind of flits
00:27:56 by and it takes a long time for any kind of narrative to get involved.
00:27:59 And even then, like the, the, the characters don't take the situation there and seriously
00:28:04 at all.
00:28:05 Like it's constantly breaking the fourth wall.
00:28:07 It's, you know, it's, it's very slapstick in that way.
00:28:10 So like, it was hard for me to get invested enough to want to play the hundreds of hours
00:28:15 of the game because at the time I was playing RPGs because of the story.
00:28:19 Like I wanted to have cool, I wanted to see cool anime characters do fun things and have
00:28:24 a plot and this guy is like, it was for the tactics game.
00:28:28 It's like, this is not a story-based game.
00:28:30 They have such a cool aesthetic, they look and they feel so cool even though the story
00:28:35 is like very, very superficial and like very, doesn't really take itself seriously at all.
00:28:42 I wanted to, I, I, you know, they make those, uh, the printing games that are like a spin-off,
00:28:48 uh, which I always wanted to try, but like I didn't have the platform they were on and
00:28:53 like I heard reviews that were like, it's okay.
00:28:57 The reviews seem pretty mixed on those, but I never, I never tried them myself.
00:29:02 I had a friend who was into them, so they're fine.
00:29:07 If you like the Disgaea series, but like all of the Nippon Ichigames, just like the dialogue
00:29:12 can be so obnoxious.
00:29:14 It's always like, all the characters are loud.
00:29:17 They're all shouting at each other and salting each other and just kind of, uh, being terrible
00:29:22 trash humans.
00:29:23 Do you remember that video Jesse did about the witch in the Hundred Knight?
00:29:27 Yeah.
00:29:28 Um, yeah.
00:29:29 That, I mean, that summarizes all my thoughts on those games, really.
00:29:32 That was his first noddle review, wasn't it?
00:29:35 I think so.
00:29:36 I believe it was.
00:29:38 What a classic.
00:29:40 Mm.
00:29:41 Tragic.
00:29:42 Tragic.
00:29:43 Um, okay, well, uh, anecdotes, anecdotes.
00:29:49 What happened?
00:29:50 What's everyone up to?
00:29:51 No, no, no, no, I've just, I, I told you, I, I, I went, I told you, I went to hell and
00:29:57 I went to a parallel universe, uh, and I made Ambrosia.
00:30:00 I'm in hell right now.
00:30:01 I have to, I Comcast is my worst enemy right now.
00:30:04 I hate them.
00:30:05 They suck.
00:30:06 They're terrible.
00:30:07 Um, so I think the last time I was on the PCP, I was talking about how Plex is sick
00:30:12 and I'm just like building my Plex empire because it's, wait, I don't remember what
00:30:17 Plex is.
00:30:18 Wait, Tom, you have, you have Plex.
00:30:19 I do.
00:30:20 I do.
00:30:21 What is Plex?
00:30:22 Is that a?
00:30:23 Plex?
00:30:24 I don't think you have talked about it.
00:30:25 I don't.
00:30:26 Talk, talk, talk to us about it under the table and not in public, if you will.
00:30:29 What?
00:30:30 Why?
00:30:31 What?
00:30:32 Is it like crack cocaine you have?
00:30:33 Yeah.
00:30:34 Yeah.
00:30:35 I'm, I'm doing hardcore drugs.
00:30:36 No, Plex is just like, Plex is an app you get on your computer and it takes all of your
00:30:39 torrents and shit and definitely legal downloads you have and it basically gives them like
00:30:44 a front end that looks kind of like Netflix, like populates it with like thumbnails and
00:30:48 metadata and all that shit.
00:30:50 Okay.
00:30:51 And then you can like share your library with people if you want and people can like
00:30:54 access your, you're basically all your like media downloads.
00:30:57 Okay, okay.
00:30:58 So wait, it's like, it's sort of like a, like a shell in which to like, like display or
00:31:05 like interface with torrents and stuff.
00:31:08 Yeah.
00:31:09 It's the convenience of torrents with the presentation of Netflix.
00:31:12 It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the windows to the torrents DOS.
00:31:16 Sure.
00:31:17 The most ideal time, the most ideal scenario I've been dreaming of building in my house
00:31:23 for years is to have a server computer that just is full of fucking all the video files
00:31:28 of all the stuff you want to watch and then you just have a Plex set up and from whatever
00:31:33 computer you access, it's literally like just going to Netflix and watching stuff off your
00:31:38 server.
00:31:39 Yeah.
00:31:40 That's kind of where we're at right now.
00:31:41 Cause I got like the smart TV and like the phone and like all that little plug in.
00:31:43 So like all the screens in my house that I access have access to my Plex server now.
00:31:48 That was like the, that was one of the hopes of what we were trying to do at the back in
00:31:52 Boston.
00:31:53 If only, if only Plex was as good back then as it is now, but it was like, it works great
00:31:56 and I love it.
00:31:57 And it's, it's awesome.
00:31:58 And so it was so awesome.
00:31:59 I told my, my real life friend, Devin, cause he has, he's like, I've been a media hoarder
00:32:03 for years and I was like, Hey, you should add your shit to my Plex so it can be super
00:32:09 powered.
00:32:10 Um, so he's like, all right.
00:32:12 So I bring my hard drive over to his place.
00:32:13 We're transferring everything over and he gets high and he didn't realize that he's
00:32:17 sitting on the cable for the hard drive and he knocks it over and it falls over.
00:32:24 And in the middle of like a, a like 12 hour transfer all day, we've just been hanging
00:32:29 out and like at like 10% left, the hard drive tips over and dies.
00:32:36 So all of my shit gone.
00:32:39 All of the shit he'd been transferring all day gone.
00:32:43 So everything gets destroyed.
00:32:44 I'm like, oh, oh, I feel my soul.
00:32:48 It hurts.
00:32:49 All those rare fucking 1080p Godzilla and Ultraman things that I'll take forever to find.
00:32:55 So my, my, my heart tribbles up into nothing and I'm a shell of a man.
00:33:01 And so in January, like this is like the beginning of the year.
00:33:03 So I'm like, I need to start rebuilding my empire from nothing again.
00:33:07 This is like the third time my hard drives have died.
00:33:11 So I start doing this.
00:33:12 I'm like, oh God, that was like terabytes of shit.
00:33:15 I'm like, okay, here we go.
00:33:17 So I start doing this.
00:33:18 I'm like, this is already a bad thing.
00:33:19 But I find out that in January, Comcast was like, hey, you now have a terabyte data cap.
00:33:27 Everybody has a terabyte data cap on their home internet.
00:33:30 There's no unlimited internet unless you pay $30 more a month now, one terabyte data cap.
00:33:35 So like January 7th data cap hit because I'm just downloading all of this shit.
00:33:41 I'm like, oh fuck.
00:33:42 And they're like, don't worry.
00:33:43 The first time you do it, we won't charge you.
00:33:45 But after this, it's another up to $50 a month for using more than a terabyte of data.
00:33:50 How are data caps real?
00:33:52 How is this a thing they're allowing?
00:33:53 Don't you love how Comcast is like, it's the middle of a pandemic.
00:33:57 Everybody's working from home.
00:33:58 Internet is essential.
00:33:59 This is the time for data caps.
00:34:01 So they've been testing it out, I guess in like 20 states the last couple years, but
00:34:04 like this month, or last month, January is when they're like nationwide, every customer
00:34:10 now has a one terabyte data cap and they're claiming this is to make things cheaper.
00:34:14 I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, because if it's $50 more for unlimited data and I had
00:34:18 unlimited data last year, it's not cheaper.
00:34:22 Don't lie to me, you motherfucker.
00:34:23 So it is now, so this month, I'm like, all right, I got to cut back on my downloads.
00:34:28 I got to space this out a little bit.
00:34:30 It's only half way through the month.
00:34:31 We're already at 75% and that's with me not trying.
00:34:34 So I'm like, this is going to be a problem.
00:34:37 This is preposterous.
00:34:38 It's cheaper for them because like everybody is downloading stuff.
00:34:44 And yeah, and it's it's so bullshit because it's like you go look for there like unlimited
00:34:48 data plans, like you can only do it if like, if you can only do if you rent their like
00:34:52 expensive router as well.
00:34:54 So that's extra money.
00:34:55 It's like more money to get unlimited data by itself than it's getting limited data with
00:34:58 their fucking router because then they can use that to like also project out a network.
00:35:03 So their phone customers get access to Wi-Fi everywhere.
00:35:06 And I'm just like, this is the worst company of all time.
00:35:10 What I understand the American Internet systems is like, there's like five or something
00:35:18 small amount of companies that have like, like monopolies in certain areas.
00:35:22 They do.
00:35:23 Yeah, and they've they've they've like, gather together to decide who gets what it's not
00:35:28 even so much.
00:35:28 OK, it's not that they have monopolies as that there are only a few that are even
00:35:33 remotely decent.
00:35:34 It's like a cartel.
00:35:35 It's like they've carved up the country.
00:35:37 It's like, this is our fiefdom that we're going to be here and you're in it.
00:35:40 Like, because like my friend who lives in Ohio was like, why don't you just get like
00:35:43 spectrum spectrums and great for us.
00:35:45 I'm like, you think spectrums available here?
00:35:48 We only have two options.
00:35:49 Everyone only has two options.
00:35:51 Also, literally, everyone in New York's biggest complaint is spectrum.
00:35:55 Like it's fucking terrible.
00:35:56 It's just as bad as Comcast.
00:35:58 They're all bad.
00:35:59 Oh, yeah.
00:35:59 All equally bad.
00:36:00 And they don't compete with anybody.
00:36:02 There's no need to be good.
00:36:04 Right.
00:36:04 Like where I'm at, it's like I have cocks because that's the one that has good
00:36:08 internet. There are eight other options.
00:36:10 They're all like, you know, like 90s dial up level.
00:36:14 Right. The satellite internet.
00:36:15 That's bullshit.
00:36:16 That's what I'm trying to fix right now, but like they're still really bad.
00:36:21 Yeah, it's a nightmare.
00:36:22 And I'm just like, well, I mean, I guess I can't complain too hard
00:36:25 because I am doing definitely legal things, but still.
00:36:31 No, you can complain.
00:36:32 You can definitely complain.
00:36:33 It doesn't matter because like I'm just thinking like even if it doesn't
00:36:36 matter why you need a terabyte of data, here's the thing.
00:36:38 I had to reformat my computer, right?
00:36:40 So like I'm thinking like, what if I want to like download on my steam
00:36:43 case? I haven't reinstalled steam yet.
00:36:44 I'm like, I can't do that this month.
00:36:46 Like I just can't play my steam games this month because I'll blow the data cap
00:36:49 just trying to download like like do maternals like a hundred gigs.
00:36:52 It's like that's that's a tenth of my monthly internet usage right there.
00:36:56 It's like, are you fucking kidding me?
00:36:58 Shit, like, like if you like download an image, like enough images,
00:37:03 you'll run out of space.
00:37:04 Yeah, I mean, like streaming YouTube video and like 1440p, that's
00:37:08 like a couple gigs.
00:37:09 If you like watch like because I've been watching Critical Role.
00:37:12 That's like four hours an episode at 1080p and there's like 200 episodes.
00:37:16 I could probably blow through the data cap just watching Critical Role every day
00:37:19 like I've been doing.
00:37:20 So you can stream the yeah, everything counts as data.
00:37:23 So downloading is like anything that is just data usage, data usage.
00:37:28 Just using the internet.
00:37:29 So like, you know, my whole family watches a fuck ton of Netflix.
00:37:32 We don't have cable anymore.
00:37:33 So that's all data being used at 1080p constantly all day.
00:37:36 I'm thinking about how like for all of our jobs, we have to like send files
00:37:41 to people at, you know, filmed at professional quality.
00:37:44 Hopefully, you know, like big ass fucking 60 frame goddamn, you know,
00:37:48 your output, you're like four gig YouTube file.
00:37:50 You got to upload that's yeah, it's a nightmare.
00:37:53 It's the worst.
00:37:55 And of course, you know, my dad's been working from home for like the last
00:37:58 year and like he's like going like big dialing into like the fucking secure
00:38:02 like military encrypted internet thing.
00:38:05 So that's like data and shit constantly.
00:38:07 So it's just like we're fucked.
00:38:09 We're fucked.
00:38:10 It's too, there's too many people in this residence for a terrible amount.
00:38:13 They found a way to squeeze more money out of you and you can't do anything about it.
00:38:18 My little sister's been vinging all of Dragon Ball Z because she's never watched it.
00:38:21 You know how big Dragon Ball Z is.
00:38:23 She's watching it in 1080p.
00:38:25 There's no way this terabyte cap is going to work.
00:38:29 It's fucked up.
00:38:30 Yeah, it's really bad.
00:38:31 So and of course, since nobody here understands internet, except for me,
00:38:35 everyone's like when they get a message about the internet,
00:38:37 that it gets your fault, you're doing it, right?
00:38:38 And I'm like, it's not just me.
00:38:42 So yeah, it's the worst.
00:38:47 I do believe Comcast is like a regular winner of the worst, worst company
00:38:53 in America. Yeah, they are the legendary worst company in America
00:38:56 multiple years running.
00:38:57 And now I know why.
00:38:59 I mean, I bet there's stiff competition for that, too.
00:39:02 Well, the EA is usually the runner up.
00:39:05 There's three.
00:39:06 There's three internet providers in this area.
00:39:08 There's there's Comcast and then because we're in Massachusetts,
00:39:13 we also have Verizon Fios, which doesn't have data caps yet,
00:39:17 but I'm sure they will soon because like, why would they not?
00:39:20 And then there's Hughes net, which is satellite internet,
00:39:22 which is like one tenth of the speed has a monthly data cap of 50 gigs
00:39:27 and is twice the price.
00:39:28 So really competitive over there.
00:39:34 Bayes, we got to go back to the old pigeon sending messages.
00:39:41 Yeah. Isn't this like, isn't this what like the like
00:39:45 Copa and Pippa were about that like this stuff is like they're not allowed to do this?
00:39:50 That this is like a net neutrality thing.
00:39:53 Well, there's no net neutrality anymore.
00:39:55 That's been gone for a couple of years, but oh, really?
00:39:59 So like all of the yelling about soap and people,
00:40:02 it didn't actually change anything, unfortunately.
00:40:05 I mean, the first thing I did like back in 2016 was completely destroyed
00:40:09 net neutrality America, but net neutrality.
00:40:11 What I this is, this is what I think is probably going to happen.
00:40:14 This is why I was tweeting about it a couple of weeks ago.
00:40:17 My thought is that what they're going to do is like,
00:40:19 this is step one, because Comcast is like, all right,
00:40:21 we're going to have data caps everywhere.
00:40:23 Step two is going to be, hey, man,
00:40:25 data is getting pretty tight during COVID.
00:40:27 Huh? Well, we're going to be really beneficial to you
00:40:30 because we own NBC because we're Comcast, the new Peacock streaming service
00:40:35 because there's no net neutrality anymore.
00:40:37 That's not going to count towards your data cap.
00:40:39 So all you normies who are streaming Netflix and blowing through your data cap,
00:40:42 you should use ours to subscribe to our streaming service instead.
00:40:45 And you can use it free of charge because we won't count that torture monthly data.
00:40:48 So we can get your subscription money from Peacock as well.
00:40:51 Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
00:40:53 So I expect that to happen in the next couple of months.
00:40:56 All right. If that's the case, what do they have on there?
00:40:59 What's the likelihood that that actually works for them?
00:41:02 You know, it probably will not work at all.
00:41:04 But like these companies do things that are completely stupid all of the time.
00:41:08 So of course, it's easy enough for them to just go
00:41:12 whoops and then correct course and, you know, just eat the money, fire a guy.
00:41:17 I mean, what are they going to do?
00:41:18 They're probably going to make money regardless.
00:41:20 Like they're going to be people who are going to need unlimited internet.
00:41:23 Well, you have no fucking choice.
00:41:24 Right. You're you're going like they're going to make less money,
00:41:28 which to them is akin to like losing a limb.
00:41:32 But, you know, it's not the same as actually losing a limb
00:41:36 because they can grow their limbs back. Yeah.
00:41:37 I think if that's a system like, well, yeah,
00:41:42 that's that it requires like a market that is competitive with itself.
00:41:48 Because like I was imagining if there's more than one choice,
00:41:51 then the other choices could say we won't have a data cap.
00:41:54 Now you can watch Netflix and because Netflix is so big,
00:41:57 that'll be a huge draw.
00:41:58 They'll get way more of the customers in the area.
00:42:01 But the way that it's that's carved up, it's like not possible
00:42:06 to have a good choice.
00:42:08 So people are fucked no matter what.
00:42:11 It's not it's not like because like the most efficient analog,
00:42:15 I think, in terms of like the U.S. is like cell phone providers,
00:42:19 like the big four cell phone providers, there's only three now,
00:42:22 actually, because fucking team mobile bought Sprint.
00:42:24 But like there's three of them, which is not great,
00:42:27 but they all operate everywhere.
00:42:29 So like they're kind of like forced to not be completely scumbags
00:42:33 that they all have to have feature parity with each other,
00:42:35 otherwise they'll get BTF owed.
00:42:37 But that's not how it works for home internet.
00:42:40 So it was only a matter of time before it all devolves into the garbage
00:42:42 I'm dealing with right now, and it sucks and it's gay and I hate it and die.
00:42:49 That's my story.
00:42:50 That's that's my tale of woe.
00:42:54 That's give and take.
00:42:55 I found the Adventures of Ultraman on VHS rip again from 1981, though.
00:43:00 Woo, that was a hard time to find again.
00:43:04 I love media.
00:43:06 That's that's the funniest fucking thing,
00:43:08 because like it's like this like dub of like this like old 1980s animated
00:43:13 Ultraman cartoon that came out and they for some reason like America
00:43:16 back in like the mid eighties, they took it, they made it a movie,
00:43:20 redubbed everything, but the main villain is called Barak, the Star Lord.
00:43:23 And I still find that funny.
00:43:26 Wait, that's great.
00:43:28 It's a 10 out of 10.
00:43:29 It's worth watching just for that.
00:43:33 I'm looking up.
00:43:34 It's also it's also the first project by the student that eventually
00:43:37 would be Sunrise, who went on the anime Gundam.
00:43:38 Oh, how do you spell Barak?
00:43:41 That's B A R A C K in that, I believe, but it's dubbed.
00:43:46 So I've never seen it spelt out.
00:43:47 So I've always just assumed that's how it was spelled as an Obama.
00:43:52 Yeah, I cannot find it on Google.
00:43:55 This is like you can see the whole movie on YouTube.
00:43:57 That's where I found it.
00:43:58 Couldn't find a torn again, but someone just uploaded it to YouTube
00:44:00 like three months ago, knowing that I would need it.
00:44:04 What a beautiful soul.
00:44:06 Yeah, I searched Barak, the Star Lord, Ultraman, and I find your tweet.
00:44:11 I find a tweet.
00:44:12 A tweet. Well, I find a tweet from you from May 26, 2019.
00:44:16 Yeah, because that was the first time I was looking because I was looking for it
00:44:19 initially. That was like the first time I found it, because I used to rent
00:44:22 this on VHS back in Blockbuster all the time.
00:44:25 And I wanted to watch it in 2019.
00:44:27 I finally found it after like doing this huge, big tweet thread of like
00:44:31 desperately looking everywhere for this fucking movie.
00:44:33 I could only find it in German for a while.
00:44:35 And it was really pissing me off.
00:44:39 Based. I got to do a PCP lecture on the Adventures of Ultraman,
00:44:42 because clearly I'm the only person in the world who knows about it.
00:44:45 I mean, yeah, perfect, perfect.
00:44:48 Radcon, Radcon 5 win.
00:44:51 We're doing it.
00:44:52 We're coming up on a year of Radcon 4, the year anniversary.
00:44:56 We're coming up on a year.
00:44:57 It's getting that time again, boys.
00:44:58 It's March, end of March or something.
00:45:01 March 16th, I think, was the end of Radcon 4.
00:45:04 It really feels like that.
00:45:06 That's like the last thing of note I've done.
00:45:09 So like everything between.
00:45:10 So sorry.
00:45:11 It's been like a year of just nothing and it's.
00:45:14 I've definitely, we definitely, well, I don't know about,
00:45:17 I don't know about all you, I don't know about you people,
00:45:19 but I definitely died at Radcon 4.
00:45:22 And the rest of everything has just been me in the after life.
00:45:26 Being tormented and purgatory.
00:45:28 Absolutely.
00:45:28 Abney, we both died in a little way.
00:45:31 I know, I mean, we literally like the plane crash
00:45:34 and I one day I will remember, but, you know, as the moment.
00:45:38 At the moment, you're like the ironic punishment to take effect.
00:45:42 All that's happening in your head is just like a simulation
00:45:45 of what could happen in the future.
00:45:46 And then you'll realize that you died back then
00:45:48 and none of this actually happened. Exactly.
00:45:51 I'm pretty sure that the Brony lecture
00:45:53 is the last thing that I actually did.
00:45:55 Like that was, I think that was the last thing Digi ever did.
00:45:59 And then did you actually died there?
00:46:02 And what you've seen has been like a like an aftershock,
00:46:04 like like ghosts, like a force ghost of Digi since then.
00:46:10 Yeah, and it's finally dissolved into nothingness.
00:46:13 That makes a lot of sense to me.
00:46:14 I've got to say of Boyd Chasers and Boyd Gazers
00:46:18 has been a little hard to understand.
00:46:20 And I haven't I haven't really made an attempt to try and understand.
00:46:25 Hard to understand exactly.
00:46:26 I think it was just the the documentary thing was very long.
00:46:31 And it was just a road trip blog.
00:46:32 It was a road trip blog.
00:46:34 And I was like, OK, I didn't watch all of it.
00:46:38 I watched a bit of it.
00:46:40 And then the podcast, there was something about a banana.
00:46:42 I was like, OK, this is clearly like very silly on the surface.
00:46:48 I don't know whether I'm interested.
00:46:51 And I just sort of stopped paying attention to what was.
00:46:54 Well, you know, a good way to find out is to fucking watch it, given.
00:46:58 That's right.
00:46:59 I mean, it's just I mean, it's just it's just it's just vlogs
00:47:02 and it's vlogs and podcasts and stuff.
00:47:04 You know, yeah, well, I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory.
00:47:07 The Void Games is a variety show is how I would describe it more so.
00:47:12 It's because the concede is that it could be thought of as a podcast
00:47:18 because it's got like call ins and it's, you know, of discussions and stuff.
00:47:22 But like it's meant to be watched.
00:47:25 It's highly edited and it's got lots of different segments,
00:47:29 so it's like a cooking segment in each episode.
00:47:31 There's all kinds of shit going on.
00:47:33 So, yeah, it's a variety hour meant to feel like one of those
00:47:36 like Japanese morning shows or something.
00:47:44 OK, I'm not familiar with Japanese morning shows, but I believe you.
00:47:47 I just felt like I should mention that even though like I could easily
00:47:51 have given it a chance and I didn't.
00:47:54 And that's I could.
00:47:59 Because I see I see that opinion a lot and I'm like, yeah, you know,
00:48:01 I feel I feel the the I don't get it sort of feeling.
00:48:06 And the obvious solution is to watch the thing that is there.
00:48:11 I I I don't understand.
00:48:13 I don't really understand not getting it.
00:48:15 I understand. I understand.
00:48:17 It's easy to not get something that you haven't watched or if it's not
00:48:21 or if it's not we subscribe for I understand that.
00:48:23 But I don't understand not getting it like it is what it is.
00:48:26 I just wasn't sure what the direction of the channel was.
00:48:28 But I don't know who cares.
00:48:30 Why would that matter?
00:48:31 And how would you figure it out other than by watching the content?
00:48:35 Like I'm playing devil's advocate. OK.
00:48:37 I'm just. Are you sometimes clear that clear pitch.
00:48:41 You know, like this is this is what you get.
00:48:44 I have I have seen I have seen people say.
00:48:47 Yeah, but like I guess I guess what it is.
00:48:50 It's what it is.
00:48:51 Well, the funny thing about that is what was ever what was ever the
00:48:54 direction of the channel?
00:48:55 Well, no, no, it wasn't like the direction of the channel was
00:48:57 like difficult to understand.
00:48:59 I think it's just like I'm so used to Digi being so open and so long
00:49:04 form about discussing the nature of the channel.
00:49:07 And I was really into befriending the Internet and then that stopped.
00:49:11 And I was like, oh, what's all this weird new stuff?
00:49:14 They're doing weed in the car.
00:49:15 That's interesting, I guess.
00:49:17 A watch. It's too visual.
00:49:19 I wanted a podcast.
00:49:21 If you if you really want if you really want what I think you want,
00:49:24 the problem is you can't have over and listen.
00:49:26 No, go to go to Voidchaser's episode one, skip to the last 17 minutes,
00:49:30 which is just me pacing around vlogging, explaining the point of the
00:49:34 previous two and a half hours, then watch the two and a half hours
00:49:37 that lead up to it.
00:49:38 Then it'll make sense.
00:49:39 Thank you.
00:49:40 As for as for Voidgazer, skip to the part in episode two,
00:49:44 where I'm sitting on a bench and I spend about 10 minutes explaining
00:49:48 that show in that episode.
00:49:50 So it'll all make sense after that.
00:49:52 All right.
00:49:53 I think.
00:49:55 Pro strats would be a block.
00:49:58 Well, the thing is that dark souls of well, what drives me insane is that
00:50:01 throughout throughout my whole career, every time I make a shift,
00:50:04 it's always met with people saying, like, I don't get it.
00:50:07 Like, what's going on?
00:50:09 And I usually have made an update video that has like 100 views
00:50:15 because no one watches.
00:50:16 I always watch those.
00:50:18 They're fucking boring.
00:50:19 Like I do too.
00:50:20 So like I was always confused why people wouldn't.
00:50:23 But like, like I would release my next video, which is in the new style
00:50:27 and like every comment is, what's this about?
00:50:29 And it's like, well, I just explained it last time.
00:50:32 So at some point, I just gave up on ever doing that again.
00:50:35 I definitely know the feeling.
00:50:40 Of like giving up, explaining.
00:50:42 Well, and the worst is like, well, what am I going to put it like at the start
00:50:46 of the video that is supposed to just stand on its own?
00:50:49 Because then when you come back to this video in a year, it's like, well,
00:50:52 now there's this fucking intro that is completely irrelevant.
00:50:55 You know, like it only was relevant to the moment that the video came out.
00:50:59 Like people, it's the weird thing about YouTube is that people have a tendency
00:51:03 to think about it like video hits my sub feed.
00:51:05 I watch it. It's about today.
00:51:07 But like actually these videos stick around forever and I get most of my views
00:51:11 through people watching my old shit.
00:51:13 Like so, you know, I consider them all legacy content in that way.
00:51:18 And like to to have that, you know, that legacy start with something
00:51:22 that was totally incidental to that moment.
00:51:25 I don't know. It's not the worst, but it's annoying, you know.
00:51:29 Yeah.
00:51:31 I will go. Especially if it's long wind.
00:51:33 I will go check those.
00:51:34 So it was like the last 17 minutes of the podcast, do you think?
00:51:38 The void chasers, the the blog documentary, the last 17 minutes is me
00:51:43 pacing around like decompressing everything that happened throughout the video.
00:51:49 Yeah. OK.
00:51:51 I think earlier, you you were also asking me what I've been doing the past week.
00:51:56 Yeah, I have a well, I've been there's the secret project
00:52:02 that I've been working on on the weekend.
00:52:04 So you can learn about on the money to spend this podcast.
00:52:07 I have also been working on my secret project.
00:52:09 Secret project, secret project.
00:52:11 I also do that. The thing.
00:52:13 It's secret, not a different thing.
00:52:15 Shut up. I'm saying things.
00:52:18 It's secret for managing hypereasons,
00:52:22 not because I have been coy or anything.
00:52:25 But I want it to be.
00:52:28 More robustly completed to a point where it's like
00:52:32 now it's a good time to mention it.
00:52:34 So stay tuned.
00:52:37 So that's most of my bulk of my weekday stuff.
00:52:41 But on the weekend
00:52:43 or rather just every night, I've been getting into Buffy, the vampire slayer
00:52:47 and it's an incredibly good show.
00:52:51 Like I in my head in the back of my head,
00:52:55 aside from the times when Jesse said it was a really good show,
00:52:58 before that, I just assumed it was like, oh, it's a Saturday morning cartoon
00:53:02 Esk TV, like Disney Channel, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch kind of sort of thing.
00:53:10 Not that it was like it's like a series.
00:53:12 It's kind of like a drama, right?
00:53:13 It's it's a drama. It's a teen drama.
00:53:16 It's like it's more to closer to an HBO thing
00:53:21 than it is to a Disney Channel thing for sure.
00:53:25 And there's a lot of really good writing, good comedy, great acting,
00:53:29 very, very cheesy choreography.
00:53:31 But I kind of love it and and makeup and effects and stuff.
00:53:35 It's really quite fucking good.
00:53:37 And I'm really into it. We're on season two right now.
00:53:41 I'm pretty sure that's like so cool.
00:53:42 Jenny Nicholson said that Vampire Diaries is better than Buffy.
00:53:45 So they just write in their diary, like I'm still alive, I guess.
00:53:51 But it's I mean, the dark because I can't go out in the summertime.
00:53:55 That sucks.
00:53:56 It's been a thousand and one days since I've seen Sunlight.
00:53:59 That's all the vampire diaries they would write.
00:54:02 That's the only thing they would write in those diaries of theirs.
00:54:07 I've never seen Buffy.
00:54:08 A bunch of fucking nerds.
00:54:10 A bunch of a bunch of stupid band chicks.
00:54:13 They had a crush on an high school like that.
00:54:15 Fuck that show.
00:54:17 Buffy's cool.
00:54:19 Xander and Willow are like the comic relief sidekick
00:54:24 normal school, high school friends characters.
00:54:27 And Xander is really funny.
00:54:29 He's like the soccer from Avatar Last Airbender of the group.
00:54:33 And Willow is
00:54:36 is really funny as well.
00:54:37 I can't think of it like a comparison, like a
00:54:41 like another character from another thing that's popular.
00:54:43 She's the Dark Souls of the group.
00:54:44 She's the Dark Souls of the group because she has the best comedy
00:54:49 liners, the best like dry humor.
00:54:52 No, I guess no dry humor.
00:54:53 I don't know how what I'm fucking saying.
00:54:54 I'm not like a reviewer or anything.
00:54:56 I'm just like a Buffy is cool.
00:54:59 That's all you need to know.
00:55:01 Well, that makes no one.
00:55:02 No thoughts had empty.
00:55:03 I mean, it's it's cool to watch just because
00:55:08 it's nineties and so many things from that era
00:55:11 are so much more antiquated than they were 10 years ago.
00:55:14 Is there witchcraft in Buffy the Vampire Slayer?
00:55:17 Oh, there's tons of things.
00:55:18 It's it's mostly for the most part.
00:55:21 Yeah, a monster of the week, and it's not always a vampire.
00:55:24 So they could like say any weird occulty sort of thing.
00:55:29 Like does Buffy herself have like powers or any kind of occult shit going on?
00:55:34 Or is she just like a regular person who fights?
00:55:36 She's the Slayer, which means that every generation,
00:55:40 there's a Slayer who is a female and she kills vampires.
00:55:44 And then there's like the Watcher or the something.
00:55:47 And he's like the informant for the Slayer.
00:55:50 And he's like the librarian of the school she's going to.
00:55:53 And she just punches and kicks and has a stake.
00:55:59 She's basically just martial arts.
00:56:01 But she's friends with like witches and demons and stuff, right?
00:56:05 She's there's one friendly vampire called Angel
00:56:09 who falls in love with her because he's fucking stupid.
00:56:14 He does like a there's this there's also a show called Angel, right?
00:56:19 Does he have a spin off show? I guess he does.
00:56:22 Yeah, I haven't seen much other than the first few things of Buffy.
00:56:27 I did I did remember seeing a YouTube video about how the
00:56:32 the HD remaster of Buffy that's put on Netflix is like it's cropped.
00:56:39 It's like zoomed in and cropped to the detriment of the show.
00:56:42 And there's a lot of effects like the remaster shows more than it's supposed to show.
00:56:47 And you can like see the set.
00:56:49 No, no, no, it's like that.
00:56:51 I don't know about maybe that happens.
00:56:53 But from what I can tell, it seems to have been zoomed in from four three
00:56:57 to the 1080p aspect ratio.
00:57:01 So the top and the bottom are cut off a little bit,
00:57:03 which doesn't matter most of the time, but sometimes it's pretty weird where
00:57:07 like a character is blocked to be like just their head is visible at the bottom
00:57:11 of the screen and the person that they're talking to is like standing up next to them.
00:57:16 And their head is at the top of the screen and slightly cut off
00:57:20 and it just looks awkward, but only sometimes.
00:57:24 I hate that shit.
00:57:25 They did the same thing with the Simpsons, too.
00:57:27 They like re-released it with like just bad, bad cropping that like ruins jokes sometimes.
00:57:33 They're like the wrong aspect ratio.
00:57:35 It's so annoying because of normies we'll never know.
00:57:39 Unless you're like a nerd that watches YouTube videos that complain about media,
00:57:43 you'd never know that like, oh, yeah, this is like if you're watching
00:57:45 Simpsons for the first time and you're just some guy who's like,
00:57:49 you know, you're a kid, you're like 18 or whatever.
00:57:51 And you're like, hmm, Simpsons is like a classic show that I've never seen.
00:57:55 I guess I'll just let's binge it all and then you watch like this fucked up version
00:57:59 that's like some some of it is ruined.
00:58:03 It's sad. It's a sad thought.
00:58:04 I don't like it.
00:58:06 I want I want to get to the part in Buffy where the guy says,
00:58:12 I'm drowning in footwear.
00:58:13 I've always wondered, I think that's literally the last episode.
00:58:16 Yeah, well, I've I've also heard there's a great show.
00:58:20 So I don't feel like rushing to get to there.
00:58:22 Yeah. I'm enjoying the ride.
00:58:24 It's very good, like very good.
00:58:26 Like like so good that I would even recommend it.
00:58:29 Whoa. No, that's crazy.
00:58:33 Even in the HD, like cropped version, it's it's mostly perfect.
00:58:37 I'm going to watch it.
00:58:39 I'm going to want I want to have things to talk about my friends
00:58:42 of the procrastinator's body.
00:58:44 My pain is immeasurable.
00:58:46 I literally when Gabe was starting to talk about this, I'm like, oh, sick.
00:58:50 I'm going to go down.
00:58:51 I can't.
00:58:54 And now I now I hate Comcast.
00:58:55 You know, I was ready to go out to my flex.
00:58:58 Immeasurable, legally ruined, and dude, let me check.
00:59:01 Is there a fucking DVD box set up?
00:59:03 I'm sure there is.
00:59:04 But but I'm not going to be some fucking disgusting physical media.
00:59:09 No, it's great.
00:59:10 The leader is so cool.
00:59:12 Because I'm going to buy me.
00:59:14 I'm going to buy the official 1080p blu-ray releases of
00:59:18 Ultraman, Ultra Seven, Ultraman Taro in steel boxes.
00:59:22 That shit's pretty fucking cool and my speed.
00:59:25 But like, Buffy, boy, these episodes are 45 minutes long.
00:59:28 They're quite long and it's it's quite a big thing.
00:59:32 Oh, look, look, look, Buffy season, Buffy complete season one to seven
00:59:36 20th anniversary edition DVD 2017 for like 43 pounds.
00:59:43 That's not that much.
00:59:44 It's I mean, it's not terrible.
00:59:46 Seven seasons.
00:59:47 Oh, I could just wait till next month and then download it.
00:59:50 Dude, VHS.
00:59:51 I watch first if you like buying are all on a daily motion.
00:59:55 I mean, but it's still I'm still down.
00:59:57 I'm still using data.
00:59:59 Oh, shit.
01:00:00 It doesn't matter.
01:00:01 I forgot you can't stream either.
01:00:02 That's fucked, dude.
01:00:04 Yeah, it's bullshit.
01:00:06 They should at least get kind of data cap you have on your phone.
01:00:11 Nothing.
01:00:11 It's literally more efficient to watch things on my phone now
01:00:14 than it is to use my devices.
01:00:17 Tether your phone.
01:00:17 You only have two gigs of tethering per month.
01:00:19 I can only watch it on the phone now.
01:00:23 It's a crime against humanity.
01:00:27 Well, you know, it's from the 90s.
01:00:28 It'll look fine.
01:00:30 I guess I got to get I got to get like one of those like fucking
01:00:33 Game Boy things where you snap it on there.
01:00:35 What about you use the other phone to HDMI like converters?
01:00:41 Can you I mean, I could like cast things, I guess,
01:00:44 with like a Chromecast or something.
01:00:45 But like now I'm living like a fucking caveman.
01:00:48 This is unacceptable cast through Plex, I'm sure.
01:00:51 Maybe God, I hate it.
01:00:54 I hate it.
01:00:56 This is where you're in.
01:00:57 This is just where you're at.
01:00:58 There's no other option.
01:00:59 Yeah, you've got to.
01:01:01 You've got to get into like the black market,
01:01:03 like physical media circuit that used to exist.
01:01:07 Yeah, yeah, it's going to come back.
01:01:09 You've got to go to start.
01:01:11 I'm going to have to convert all this amazing place.
01:01:13 You can go actually called the Philippines,
01:01:16 where you can legally purchase physical versions of literally
01:01:19 everything that exists for very, very cheap.
01:01:22 And your American dollar is worth way the fuck more there.
01:01:26 Can you even go to a different country now?
01:01:29 Is that possible?
01:01:30 I think it might be.
01:01:32 I don't know.
01:01:33 I don't know about the Philippines.
01:01:34 I don't I don't think America is like I don't think America
01:01:38 has like travel restrictions.
01:01:39 I guess not.
01:01:40 I think I know like maybe it could be there.
01:01:42 People are restricted travel from America.
01:01:45 No, no, no, here's what they do.
01:01:46 You're allowed to get on the plane.
01:01:47 You're allowed to buy the ticket.
01:01:49 But then as soon as you're in the plane, it flies off.
01:01:51 They shoot it down.
01:01:51 Yeah, yeah, yeah, because that way they still make their money.
01:01:54 That makes sense.
01:01:55 They can't but they can't cancel the plane
01:01:57 because that would just cost them too much in red tape.
01:02:00 It's cheaper to just keep it going.
01:02:02 Well, unironically, though, if you really did,
01:02:05 like this is not even a bad way to amass a collection
01:02:08 like I'm describing, because while it might be like
01:02:10 probably a thousand dollars for the plane ticket to the Philippines,
01:02:14 you could stay there for a month on less than a thousand dollars
01:02:18 and buy a media collection like with like like for the thousand
01:02:22 dollars that you would spend there.
01:02:26 What I'm trying to say is I once went to the Philippines with two grand
01:02:29 and I bought a lot of figures.
01:02:31 Most of my collection I got there.
01:02:33 So God, yeah, it was very cheap to live.
01:02:37 And it was very cheap to come back with a whole lot of shit.
01:02:40 So, you know, unironically, if you're an adventurous person,
01:02:43 just fly out to a third world country,
01:02:45 buy a whole bunch of contraband and mail it to yourself.
01:02:51 Incredible.
01:02:53 Well, if I get that desperate, maybe I will.
01:02:57 Don't spend the extra fifty dollars a month on unlimited Internet.
01:02:59 Spend two thousand dollars going to the Philippines.
01:03:03 I got the you might go to spend money to make money.
01:03:07 The conversion rate from USD to the Filipino, whatever is good.
01:03:11 The Filipino.
01:03:13 But if you convert those US dollars to Bitcoin, then you'll have you.
01:03:16 That's even better.
01:03:17 That's true.
01:03:18 I've made like a grand in Bitcoin in the last month.
01:03:21 Damn.
01:03:22 Just from everybody else in the world.
01:03:24 I fucking hate you so much.
01:03:26 I'm so I'm so I'm on the I look.
01:03:28 I need that.
01:03:28 I wouldn't be able to pay rent probably with that.
01:03:30 I I looked at it like an hour ago and I saw that it had kept going.
01:03:35 I want I want you to know, Digi, that I am actively rooting
01:03:37 against you because every time I see Bitcoin go up, I get angry.
01:03:41 I get mad because I sold it.
01:03:42 I sold it at a slight loss.
01:03:44 I was just wait for that anymore.
01:03:46 Just wait for the next step.
01:03:47 It's fine.
01:03:48 Oh, you're a fucking dip.
01:03:49 You'll buy the dip.
01:03:50 Oh, buy the dip.
01:03:51 No, I don't count twenty seven.
01:03:54 I'm fucking done.
01:03:55 Jimmy, Jimmy fucked me.
01:03:56 I don't have fucked me.
01:03:57 Everything I don't have this Bitcoin to like pull it out at any point.
01:04:01 Like I have I might spend some of it, but like it's there to be there.
01:04:05 Like Bitcoin is going to only ever go up.
01:04:09 Bitcoin like in the long term.
01:04:11 So and Ethereum.
01:04:12 So I'm not trying to spend that shit.
01:04:14 I'm glad Ethereum's going up because I got like forty dollars
01:04:17 of free Ethereum from M.Strange in like twenty eighteen.
01:04:20 And now it's worth almost three hundred bucks.
01:04:21 I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I had my doge coins going down,
01:04:26 but I'm still up almost three hundred percent
01:04:28 and my initial investment of doge coin.
01:04:30 So what's what's what's that's that's six cents.
01:04:33 I bought it.
01:04:34 I was shocked to see that it has continued to rise
01:04:37 since the after the peak.
01:04:38 OK, it's down a little bit.
01:04:39 Oh, it's it was high.
01:04:41 It's high. It was like eight, eight and a half cents.
01:04:43 So it's still down.
01:04:44 It reached it reached it again.
01:04:45 Like it, you know, I mean, most things they spike really
01:04:48 like GME spiked really high and then it settled down again.
01:04:51 Dogecoin spiked really high
01:04:52 and it's lean like it was still down, but then it went like back.
01:04:54 It went back to where it was spiking to.
01:04:56 I was shocked and appalled.
01:04:59 OK, OK, it looks like it's kind of consolidating right now.
01:05:03 I'm hoping Bitcoin crashes so I can actually get put some money into it.
01:05:08 No, just put money into it now.
01:05:09 Don't that's not how this works.
01:05:11 Just money. I mean, I have one pound in right now.
01:05:16 Well, put more one pound twenty.
01:05:17 One could put one could crash.
01:05:19 Put in crash that.
01:05:22 Yeah, but that wouldn't that wouldn't hurt you
01:05:24 unless you spent it when it crashed.
01:05:26 Like you just hold it until it's uncrashed.
01:05:28 Like it will uncrash.
01:05:30 It's I think Bitcoin and Ethereum are stable enough at this point
01:05:34 as like the go-tos that like the entire fucking crypto economy is built on.
01:05:38 That like if it crashes, if it crashes, though,
01:05:41 then it would be better to buy when it crashes like let me put it before.
01:05:46 This is how my it makes intuitive.
01:05:48 I guess it makes intuitive sense that since it's like been high,
01:05:52 like it's got high and then it stayed pretty high for a while.
01:05:55 And well, it's gone up like considerably continually over.
01:05:58 Like if you look at the trend over time, it's just going up.
01:06:01 I mean, it's pretty fucked when you think about it,
01:06:03 that Elon Musk like made one purchase and it like doubled the value of Bitcoin.
01:06:07 It's pretty weird.
01:06:08 And he can do that any time is the other thing like that can keep happening.
01:06:12 It's all about how people are playing the the long game with the market
01:06:16 because like it doesn't necessarily benefit people holding Bitcoin for it to.
01:06:20 I've decided after doing this whole stock thing and like doing the game
01:06:23 stop shit and like having doge and Ethereum that crypto and stock market
01:06:29 is gay, it's good, but it's also incredibly gay.
01:06:32 And I hate it. It's I hate it.
01:06:36 I mean, I'm I have I have I have hated every second of being involved with this
01:06:40 stuff. It has been a miserable, so I'm crushing 200.
01:06:43 I love this. I'm fucking mad into it.
01:06:45 I love $200. It's always good.
01:06:48 It's always good when the market is bullish.
01:06:49 It's always good when the market is bull.
01:06:51 No, I'm like, OK, and I'm up $200 on Dogecoin.
01:06:54 And I am like insulted by the fact that like I just have $200
01:06:59 that I did nothing for and I hate it and it's it makes me like mad.
01:07:03 But you didn't do nothing.
01:07:04 You made a sensible investment and we're smarter than everybody else who didn't.
01:07:07 I am with Tom. I'm with Tom.
01:07:10 No, the fact that the fact that it paid off
01:07:12 does not mean it was a sensible investment.
01:07:14 Not even that. It's just like I get make call me an old fashioned pro.
01:07:18 But I feel like gains not made by direct labor is wrong and unethical.
01:07:25 I feel the apps. I know I know what you mean.
01:07:29 But also, like, OK, we can you can you can you can say that
01:07:34 unlike in like a theoretical sense, like what you say what you say.
01:07:37 What I'm saying, Tom, is that capitalism works on paper,
01:07:40 but in practice, it just doesn't it just doesn't pan out.
01:07:42 It never works. And and you're you're I don't know.
01:07:46 I don't know. I don't think there's anything more capitalistic than the stock market.
01:07:49 There are plenty of other.
01:07:50 There are plenty of other cases why, like, you know, the wage wage laborers, like.
01:07:56 Uh, you're you're in a you're in a it's an idealistic way of looking at things.
01:08:02 And like, I'm already I've already been convinced that it is not true
01:08:05 that, like, an honest day's work for an honest day's pay makes the world go around or whatever.
01:08:10 So, like, agreed. But like, also, I'm past it.
01:08:13 I'm past your point.
01:08:14 You said you hate it, but you're also disagreeing with me.
01:08:16 So I don't know what your stance is at this point.
01:08:19 Well, it's just that.
01:08:20 Are you just mad that you lost money?
01:08:22 Is that because I know you're not actually saying that it's
01:08:24 I know you're not actually saying that it's unethical.
01:08:26 I'm just saying I understand that feeling, but I don't have it
01:08:30 because I've been disillusioned of the idea that, like, working for your money
01:08:35 is like the is the right thing.
01:08:37 Well, money is wrong. Money is the problem.
01:08:40 That's my whole thing.
01:08:40 It's like the next step is like, oh, this is bullshit, anyways.
01:08:44 Right. Like, every time it exists, I don't I don't think there should be
01:08:48 a system that allows someone to do nothing and make more money than 99
01:08:52 percent of the population, like, working all day.
01:08:56 Sure. And the fact that I'm benefiting from that system
01:08:58 and how helping it perpetuate, even in a tiny way, does make me want to wretch
01:09:03 and I hate it.
01:09:05 But other people have been doing that all along.
01:09:07 Correct. And we should murder those people.
01:09:09 It's not like it's a news.
01:09:09 Wait, Elisar, shut that out.
01:09:10 All I know is that making investment gives you investment
01:09:14 capital to make more investment in the future so that you can actually put
01:09:17 money into the things you want to do.
01:09:18 And it's really, really great.
01:09:20 And that's why I'm doing it.
01:09:21 Unless it, unless it crashes, though, unless it crashes, because it can happen
01:09:25 any time, just leave your money in there until it's good again.
01:09:28 OK, I mean, pull it out when it crashes.
01:09:32 Don't do that. That's bad instincts.
01:09:34 That's weird. That's stuff people do to kill themselves.
01:09:36 Like it's like it's a weird suicide thing.
01:09:39 Like, so, OK, let me just I want to run through my last
01:09:43 the simple story of my three years with crypto so far, because I started
01:09:47 with just $50 in Ethereum and it immediately went down in value.
01:09:51 And it continued to stay down in value for two years.
01:09:55 It was two years before the Ethereum was worth $50 again.
01:09:59 And as soon as it went over $50, I was like, oh, OK, like this thing
01:10:03 is this thing's still alive and it's on the upswing again, as it had been.
01:10:07 Like I had bought in at a time when it was at its healthiest.
01:10:11 Like it had just reached a new height.
01:10:12 So I bought some.
01:10:13 It dips for two years, reaches a new height again.
01:10:16 So then at that point, I put more money into Ethereum and Bitcoin.
01:10:20 I think I had $100 in each as of last year.
01:10:24 And then I put like $600 into Chainlink.
01:10:28 And this was at a time where last August, like Chainlink was surging.
01:10:33 I got in at I got in just before the peak.
01:10:37 So I did make money when it peaked.
01:10:39 But then it immediately went like to half of its worth and stayed there
01:10:45 for a long time.
01:10:46 And so I was like, well, either I just lost this bubble
01:10:51 because it was completely possible that link was only ever going to have
01:10:54 one bubble burst at this moment and it would never be worth this amount again.
01:10:57 But there is logic when it comes to bitcoins,
01:11:03 it's not just gambling because there is actual reasons that each of these coins exist.
01:11:09 So like in terms of what Bitcoin and Ethereum are so valuable
01:11:13 because the entire structure of the economy is built on them.
01:11:16 So Chainlink is similar in that it helps to facilitate
01:11:21 Ethereum's ability to work faster.
01:11:23 So the more like Chainlink there is, the better the whole system runs, essentially.
01:11:28 So that like in that's because of that, I was like, OK, I'm going to hold on to this.
01:11:33 But like I was down to like half of the value of it
01:11:36 up until this whole fucking game stonks thing happened.
01:11:39 And just because of this, my Chainlink increased in the what had been originally
01:11:44 600 had been at 300 most of the time is now worth 900.
01:11:47 I transferred all that into Bitcoin immediately
01:11:49 because I don't trust Chainlink enough to, you know, to stay at this height forever.
01:11:55 But I do trust Bitcoin to keep going up and I wanted my money there.
01:11:58 So I still have a little bit in Chainlink in case it one day moons, as they say,
01:12:03 where it just has a sudden spike in my $70 is worth something dramatically different.
01:12:08 But like actually the fucking Ethereum and Bitcoin that I had that I had
01:12:12 $100 in each are now worth $500 each from this spike.
01:12:16 Those I don't think are just going to drop.
01:12:19 And even if they did, they would drop to a level
01:12:21 that was still higher than what I bought in at.
01:12:24 And then if I didn't sell, then it could still go higher up than what I even have.
01:12:28 That's the current height.
01:12:29 So I have I have fucked up at every stage.
01:12:32 Like I bought when I bought of crypto.
01:12:36 I have a Bitcoin when it was like close to peaking.
01:12:38 It went up for a while, but then it went down again.
01:12:40 So that's when I sold.
01:12:41 If I it's true, if I had just held it, just don't never sell when you're down.
01:12:46 Just never if I had just I didn't sell when I was down.
01:12:49 I sold basically when it was back to where I bought it.
01:12:52 So like I lost like a slight amount.
01:12:54 If I had just held it, I would be up like a ways.
01:12:57 So I'm very angry, very upset, a fuck Elon Musk.
01:13:02 It was the same with GameStop.
01:13:04 Also, I bought it at like the literal peak.
01:13:06 I bought it at the literal peak because I was like, OK, the hype train is real.
01:13:10 I was going on Wall Street bets.
01:13:11 I was seeing like everyone saying it's going to the moon.
01:13:13 Oh, my God, fear of missing out FOMO.
01:13:15 I got to get in on the rocket before it goes.
01:13:17 OK, it didn't work.
01:13:18 I whatever.
01:13:20 Yeah, that's fine.
01:13:21 It was for the means for the meme.
01:13:23 So it's all good.
01:13:24 A general good bet with all of this is if you are not plugged into any kind
01:13:28 of financial sphere enough that you heard about it before other people did,
01:13:33 don't get in on it because you're in the shock.
01:13:35 The fact that I was the fact.
01:13:38 Yeah, you're right.
01:13:39 The fact that I was just hearing about it then when I was not involved
01:13:43 with the community meant that like it had already gone off.
01:13:45 If your advice is coming from Twitter, you're too late.
01:13:48 So yeah.
01:13:50 So I'm very smart, though.
01:13:54 I mean, I still have my one share of GameStop.
01:13:56 It's worth like a fraction.
01:13:57 I actually just bought more.
01:13:59 I actually just bought more because I set a I set an order to auto go off
01:14:03 when it when it hit like 50 bucks and it just hit 50 bucks.
01:14:06 I don't think it's going to go up anytime soon.
01:14:08 I mean, as long as it doesn't go any lower than 50, I won't lose any more.
01:14:12 To me, the unsung power of all of this, though, is that like so many people
01:14:16 who never would have ever got involved in stocks or fucking crypto just did.
01:14:22 And like even having a negative experience, at least you like get your foot
01:14:26 in the door and know what it is so you can say, OK, well, I know what the apps
01:14:29 do. I know the only good thing that's happened with my stock portfolio so far
01:14:33 is that Sundial Growers did pretty good.
01:14:35 I got it at 80 cents.
01:14:37 It went up to like four.
01:14:38 I sold a little bit then.
01:14:39 So I'm up on Sundial.
01:14:41 I made some money there.
01:14:43 Oh, I have I have only lost money.
01:14:46 I've only lost money on these.
01:14:48 I just want to I just want to get to 10 cents.
01:14:52 God, well, you didn't lose much money.
01:14:55 So I thought I was so clever.
01:14:58 Well, I lost a little more.
01:14:59 The stuff I've seen people lose in this is like the the amount of down
01:15:03 people will sell at is absolutely preposterous.
01:15:06 Like I saw people like as soon as link went from 17 dollars to 12 dollars
01:15:10 immediately sold their link, even though they had thousands of dollars in it,
01:15:13 because they're like, oh, I don't want it to go down any further.
01:15:15 And it's like, well, you should have considered the money forfeit
01:15:18 when you put it in, right?
01:15:20 Like that is the way I did with GameStop.
01:15:22 And that's why I'm not that I put $500 in total.
01:15:25 And I was like, well, I can't get a PS5.
01:15:27 So I guess this is where that money is going, right?
01:15:30 That's that's really the best way to look at it.
01:15:32 Only put in money you won't miss, you know.
01:15:35 Yeah, that's that's what I did wrong.
01:15:38 That's what I did wrong with Bitcoin.
01:15:39 I put too much in.
01:15:40 And if Bitcoin had fallen to zero, I would have been devastated by the loss.
01:15:43 That's why I got paper hands and I was like, I can't do it.
01:15:46 I can't stay in. This is too dangerous.
01:15:48 I took it out. Now it's up 50 percent.
01:15:50 I would be way, way up. I'm I'm I'll never get over it.
01:15:53 Also, nobody listening to this listen to anything I'm saying.
01:15:56 I'm not a financial advisor.
01:15:57 I don't know what I'm doing.
01:15:58 I have no money to my name.
01:16:00 Except this crypto that I happen to have got lucky with.
01:16:02 I hear someone making stock advice and then saying, I'm not a financial advisor.
01:16:07 All I think of is like YouTube videos where it's like, this is not my copyright.
01:16:11 I don't claim copyright for this. I'm like, yeah, OK, fuck you.
01:16:14 When I hear someone say that, I think, hmm, this guy knows to cover his bases.
01:16:17 This guy is smart.
01:16:18 The thing with with all, you know, the ethical
01:16:25 nurse, like I think it's sort of immaterial.
01:16:30 Like it's it's easy to to to think of it as like, oh,
01:16:34 you're not doing any work and you're making capital and people work
01:16:38 and they they don't even get as much as it's more of a damnation of working
01:16:43 than it is the stock. It's it's it's I don't think that there's a problem.
01:16:48 I make my living from YouTube ad revenue.
01:16:50 So I already like don't like like working for honest work
01:16:54 for for money is already like out the window for me.
01:16:57 It's like that ship and sail.
01:16:59 I mean, I think it's fair to consider artistic creation
01:17:03 and entertainment to be to be honest work.
01:17:06 It's the hardest work of all. Yeah, sure.
01:17:08 But but like I think I think that all it does really is just it just
01:17:14 creates a lot of easy jealousy.
01:17:17 Like you see people who have in your eyes done nothing necessarily
01:17:21 and then they get become billionaires.
01:17:22 And you're like, well, not necessarily billionaires,
01:17:25 but like they get thousands of thousands of something or other
01:17:27 because they were in early on something and you're like, fuck,
01:17:30 he ego raptured it.
01:17:31 He fucking ego raptured that cryptocurrency. Yeah.
01:17:34 And and it's easy to get jealous and to, you know,
01:17:37 to get really emotionally invested in it.
01:17:40 And I just I don't like which is which is the correct response.
01:17:43 And I'm going to pitch you and you should use it.
01:17:45 I don't like you.
01:17:46 And I'm not fucking super upset about it.
01:17:48 Teens to people's door.
01:17:49 The whole thing with the stock market is that like it's not for
01:17:52 Pearls anyways, right?
01:17:53 Because like even if like GameStop doubled, well, here's my point.
01:17:57 Even if GameStop had doubled in value when me and Ben bought in at like
01:18:00 three hundred and was sitting at six hundred right now, like, oh,
01:18:03 we'd have three hundred more dollars.
01:18:04 Hurray. Like we don't have enough money to make any substantial
01:18:08 money on the stock market.
01:18:10 You know, I guess if you're considering like, I mean, we're like
01:18:13 particularly broke, like compared to I think the stock market is great
01:18:19 for like middle class people over half of America can't afford like
01:18:23 a four hundred dollar surprise bill.
01:18:25 Like I I'm doing I'm have more savings than the majority of Americans,
01:18:30 which blows my mind.
01:18:31 That's this terrifying to me.
01:18:34 Yeah. Yeah.
01:18:35 I think the I think the metagame of like the the capitalist money system
01:18:41 we're trapped in currently is that like basically in lieu of their
01:18:47 being socialism, people want to create a like definitive self like a
01:18:53 self safety net.
01:18:56 And so like most people who get involved in investment, like if you see
01:18:59 the people who talk about it online, almost all of them are just like,
01:19:02 I just feel like I need to have at least a million dollars or else
01:19:06 I won't be able to survive this world.
01:19:08 Like it's just that mentality of like the safety of money that these people
01:19:13 have, which is not even real.
01:19:14 Money doesn't really make you safe.
01:19:16 The best way to be safe is have connections and people who will don't
01:19:19 want to kill you, which if you have more money, more people want to kill you.
01:19:23 So it's not necessarily the best way to go.
01:19:27 I mean, I mean, money.
01:19:29 Well, I know what you mean.
01:19:31 Money does make you safe from some things.
01:19:33 It does.
01:19:33 I think it makes you safe from poverty.
01:19:35 And that's a difficult.
01:19:37 Yes, yeah, poverty is pretty dangerous.
01:19:39 Or so anything above the level of like, like if you have more than like,
01:19:45 I don't know, if you're making more than, say, like five hundred thousand
01:19:49 dollars a year, then like you're a target at that point, you know, maybe.
01:19:53 Yeah.
01:19:54 Well, I mean, I'm not making anywhere close to that.
01:19:56 So I don't even want I have nowhere to go, but I just want like 40 K a year.
01:20:00 That's all I want.
01:20:01 I'd be totally happy.
01:20:02 I would like, I would like to make, I would like to make.
01:20:06 Well, I wouldn't like to personally make five hundred thousand dollars a year.
01:20:10 I would like as Yig Studio, a group of content creators, you know, like with
01:20:15 money being put in and out of, you know what I mean?
01:20:17 Like I'd like the profit of my endeavor to be that
01:20:21 not not that it's just me being rich or whatever.
01:20:25 Yeah, yeah, like, I don't I'm at the point where
01:20:30 because I was living I was living so meagerly for a long time and I still am.
01:20:35 But I'm I'm making a little more money now.
01:20:37 And like I'm still at like a I'm still at like like a submittal class income.
01:20:42 But like my expenses are so low that I like I've been saving money for a while now.
01:20:47 And I don't know what to do with it all.
01:20:49 And I'm starting to think like, yeah, this is like it's time to reinvest
01:20:53 this in like projects or something, whatever that means.
01:20:58 Like, I don't know, pay people to make stuff that I can incorporate
01:21:03 into something, I don't know, maybe it was like
01:21:08 pay comic artists to do more vapor or something for more of that.
01:21:12 Like because that money is not for anything else
01:21:15 because I have nothing really that I need to spend it on for myself personally.
01:21:20 So it like it needs to do something.
01:21:24 But I don't know what.
01:21:26 You know what I mean?
01:21:27 Yeah, it's just sitting in your back again.
01:21:29 And it's just like this is like wasted potential.
01:21:31 And so I guess I see that I see that more as like it's not like it's money
01:21:35 that I have made, but I feel like it should be, you know, like budget money
01:21:39 for like a a an enterprise or a I mean, not like a studio because I'm just one guy.
01:21:46 But you know what I mean?
01:21:48 You want your money to work?
01:21:49 Reinvest essentially, as long as you're sitting on it, fuel fuel the power
01:21:54 of some kind of creative machine.
01:21:57 Indeed, based, based.
01:22:00 All right, someone else talk.
01:22:01 I'm done.
01:22:05 Well, I don't like money, but I sure need to get some.
01:22:10 Preach my dude.
01:22:11 Patreon.com slash give and take.
01:22:13 Fuck.
01:22:14 Oh, shit.
01:22:15 Go to the Money Spenders podcast.
01:22:16 We can learn all about stuff that I say.
01:22:22 We all have bonus podcast, right?
01:22:24 Like all of us are doing one.
01:22:26 Yeah, I think so.
01:22:27 I should start.
01:22:29 I should do a Noida cast.
01:22:31 I should I should do a podcast.
01:22:33 You should do a Noida stream.
01:22:35 I should.
01:22:35 Yeah, that makes sense.
01:22:37 I think it OK.
01:22:39 I think it would be boring because post your Noida streams on only fans
01:22:42 and people tip you.
01:22:43 That's what we've learned today.
01:22:45 I feel like OK.
01:22:46 I feel like if I was streaming a normal Noida run, I would be distracted
01:22:51 by the chat and I would just die a lot and it would be boring and annoying.
01:22:56 But now that I'm on a good run with someone with you to read.
01:22:58 Yeah, I was going to say that was the thing we learned from I am Games.
01:23:02 It's so much easier to do stream when one person is gaming and one person is talking.
01:23:06 Then that makes sense.
01:23:07 Every time I solo stream, it's a nightmare.
01:23:10 But now, but now on my current run, I think it would be boring
01:23:15 because like so much of what I'm doing now is just like collecting
01:23:19 wands and spells and like storing them somewhere and just kind of going through
01:23:22 my collection like, OK, put this here.
01:23:25 So I have this and just like arranging things and then like just doing trial
01:23:28 and error where I like I'll stand there and like, OK, what if I put this in a
01:23:31 wand and fire it and then what if I put this in a wand and fire it?
01:23:34 OK, the the fire rate changes.
01:23:36 How long can a run potentially go for?
01:23:38 Like you're you're saying this run like you're in one continual run.
01:23:42 OK, well, a normal run where I just go to the boss, like usually I would die
01:23:46 within like half an hour or an hour.
01:23:48 Maybe like a good run might take a few hours if I like made it all the way
01:23:52 to the boss and won this run.
01:23:54 Where I'm like trying to like I've become like insanely powerful
01:23:57 and I have like the world is my oyster and I can do anything.
01:24:01 I mean, I've been the last for like several days because just doing a lot
01:24:05 of like man wand management and a lot of like, OK, like like like getting
01:24:10 through the the parallel world rock wall, I had to do a lot of like preparation
01:24:15 for that. I had to like I had to find the ambrosia.
01:24:17 I had to like separate it out.
01:24:19 I had to put it in potions.
01:24:20 I had to go like prepare my one specifically for the task and go do it.
01:24:24 So like a lot of it is like stuff that is not even that interesting to see.
01:24:29 A lot of it is me just like managing inventory slots.
01:24:32 And then, you know, it would have been cool.
01:24:35 I guess it would have been cool to stream that because it's like, OK,
01:24:39 I would be like preparing and preparing and preparing and talking about like,
01:24:42 how am I preparing to do this and then to go do it.
01:24:47 But it's too late.
01:24:48 I guess I could do that to like go to the moon or something.
01:24:51 But I feel like boring through the the parallel
01:24:54 world's wall was the big was the big challenge.
01:24:57 And I've already done it.
01:24:58 So oh, God, it's just like Bitcoin.
01:25:02 It's just like Bitcoin.
01:25:03 I didn't I didn't I didn't get in the ground floor.
01:25:06 I didn't start early enough.
01:25:08 It's too late now.
01:25:10 It's never too late by Bitcoin.
01:25:13 Yeah, I feel this way.
01:25:15 I feel like it's too late for a lot of things.
01:25:18 And like it's I just I guess I want to be part of a year ago on to everybody.
01:25:23 The idea that like rather than looking at it is like I put X amount of money
01:25:27 into Bitcoin with the intention of removing all of that money when it goes up.
01:25:31 Think of it like just I can spend whatever I have earned.
01:25:36 So like if you put in 500 and then it goes up to 700, spend the 200
01:25:40 and then don't spend any of the 500 you initially put in like.
01:25:45 Oh, back on back on the crypto thing.
01:25:48 There is one. OK, I watch this.
01:25:51 I watch this channel called Clear Value Tax, where where a very dignified
01:25:57 Asian man who is an accountant explains to me how taxes work.
01:26:05 And he made some videos recently recommending this app called KuCoin,
01:26:10 which lets you do things like you can invest in crypto
01:26:15 but then you can like assign your crypto to be like automatically
01:26:21 lent out to people and repaid to you with interest.
01:26:25 And and also you can create like a robot that will like automatically trade
01:26:30 cryptos like as the price fluctuates to like generate profit for you.
01:26:36 So I have been like trying to fuck with that a little bit as like an old
01:26:41 because I didn't I didn't like the experience of investing in stuff.
01:26:45 And it has failed at me every time.
01:26:48 But like people say I've heard people say that like, OK, investing
01:26:51 and holding is one thing and trading is another.
01:26:53 And it's like a different way to make money with cryptocurrency.
01:26:56 So I put like I put like a hundred dollars into my KuCoin account
01:26:59 just to like see just to see what it does.
01:27:04 Actually, it's been in there for like almost a week now.
01:27:07 Another thing that's very helpful to my
01:27:09 crypto trading has been that I have a lot of basic attention tokens.
01:27:14 And I don't know if you guys know about that.
01:27:15 But I don't know what the fuck that is.
01:27:17 So do you use Brave browser at all by chance?
01:27:21 OK, well, Brave browser is like a slight chrome,
01:27:25 but it has a built in ad blockers and and tracker blockers.
01:27:30 And also it has a crypto wallet that you can activate
01:27:34 where you collect passively a type of crypto token
01:27:38 called basic attention tokens, where if you allow it to like show you ads
01:27:42 or even just going through web pages, like you slowly collect
01:27:47 basic attention tokens and then you can spend them on
01:27:51 like creators and stuff who have who are like are signed up for the program.
01:27:55 So for instance, if you had
01:27:58 like the bat thing set up on your brave, then you go to my YouTube channel,
01:28:02 there will be a button you can click that allows you to just give me bat.
01:28:05 I've made a couple hundred dollars worth of bat this way
01:28:08 that I reinvested into other cryptos.
01:28:10 So that was a big starting point.
01:28:12 Literally money that I just got from people
01:28:15 decided to make their donation via crypto instead of regular money.
01:28:22 I use brave, but I have never understood that stuff.
01:28:25 Let me do brave is getting so sick into it bats always been dope.
01:28:29 Did did you or Trixie?
01:28:31 Did you hear that brave and their last update?
01:28:35 They just integrated IPFS.
01:28:37 I don't know what that is.
01:28:38 That is the Web three thing.
01:28:40 Remember that shit we were talking about back in 2018?
01:28:42 They built IPFS into brave.
01:28:44 So now you can go to IPFS websites directly through.
01:28:47 Oh, oh, sick.
01:28:49 Well, that makes that way easier because then we just promote the brave browser
01:28:52 more and can also make those websites.
01:28:54 So OK, like Web three.
01:28:56 I'm still following like bat or not bat IPFS and like all that stuff.
01:29:02 All those kind of things.
01:29:03 So I keep my finger on that.
01:29:05 It's getting better at some point.
01:29:07 You and I were way too far ahead of the curve.
01:29:09 We just dive into early.
01:29:11 But like, you know, literally five years ahead of maybe like in two years
01:29:16 would be like, yeah, yeah, we're finally there where we need to be to make that shift.
01:29:20 Because like everyone, it's funny.
01:29:21 You watch like the people like the doing the IPFS presentation.
01:29:24 They're all talking about what we were talking about in 2018
01:29:26 about how everything's too centralized.
01:29:27 It's all bullshit.
01:29:28 I don't know if you've seen the huge push of after Donald Trump got kicked off
01:29:33 Twitter, there was a gigantic wave of all kinds of people, just not even like
01:29:38 right wingers, just funny accounts.
01:29:40 Anybody funny on Twitter got like taken down.
01:29:43 Huge mass migration to Mastodon, which is itself a decentralized thing.
01:29:50 No, it's not even decentralized.
01:29:51 Instead, it's server based.
01:29:52 Like you had federated the federated thing.
01:29:54 Yes, you federate different servers, similarly to Peartube.
01:29:58 We'll get into all this explanations later, I guess, but some other time.
01:30:02 But yeah, like Dick Masterson immediately set up a Mastodon when all this happened
01:30:07 that started popping off.
01:30:08 And so that's all a fascinating world.
01:30:12 And if if that keeps taking off, I think it'll lead more and more people to
01:30:16 you got to you got to find the federated net.
01:30:18 That's what we've been calling it.
01:30:19 It's the federated internet.
01:30:20 You got to find the right federation because like Mastodon is like when I was
01:30:23 on one of the networks for that, that was when I got banned for saying I was
01:30:29 crippled because my life was hurt.
01:30:31 So that was the thing.
01:30:32 Like, yeah, what even did you do?
01:30:35 You I said I said my because my that was somebody had my leg injury,
01:30:39 which is still, I guess, technically there.
01:30:40 But like, when it was really bad and it's like, yeah, I'm like crippled.
01:30:43 I can't walk.
01:30:43 It's like, you can't say crippled.
01:30:44 That's a slur.
01:30:45 You're bad.
01:30:46 OK. Wow.
01:30:48 I look like even in the context of I am, yeah, they're like, it doesn't matter.
01:30:51 You can't say that language.
01:30:53 Well, to be fair, that was a warning.
01:30:55 And then they listened to the procrastinators podcast, listen, and then I got
01:30:58 banned. It's funny you mentioned that because Dick had initially made a
01:31:03 federation called his is called paypig.net.
01:31:06 But then because of the fact that everyone just jumped on there and started
01:31:10 saying the N word over and over again, he made a second one called verify.af for
01:31:14 just people who he could trust to not say the N word all day on his Mastodon server.
01:31:19 Incredible.
01:31:20 Hmm. I have OK.
01:31:23 I have had I bought a hundred dollars worth of US US DT on Kucoin.
01:31:29 It has been auto lending itself for about six days.
01:31:34 It has made 50 cents worth of interest, which does not sound that impressive,
01:31:39 but but that's in less than a week.
01:31:41 And if I iterate that 52 times for a year, that's a profit of about 30 percent,
01:31:48 which is a lot.
01:31:50 But the problem, though, is that like I would have to spend like eight percent
01:31:54 just to like put my money in there, which seems like a lot because they take fees out.
01:31:59 So this is a nightmare.
01:32:01 I hate I hate it. I hate numbers.
01:32:04 I hate now. I'm just dumb.
01:32:05 I just want to make cool art get rich.
01:32:08 That's that's that's about as complex as my mind.
01:32:10 That's the thing that's behind me as well.
01:32:13 Like I don't want to be a money person in order to do all this.
01:32:16 But it's so it's so I mean, because in order to get good at it,
01:32:19 you have to just like, well, I'm not an artist anymore.
01:32:21 I'm a financial. Here's that's not money.
01:32:23 I don't think that's true.
01:32:24 I don't think it's as hard as it seems.
01:32:26 Here's what fucks me up.
01:32:27 Here's I don't think I'm a person.
01:32:29 I'm an all or nothing person.
01:32:30 I want to do what is optimal all of the time.
01:32:33 So if keeping my money doing art, then holy shit, it all.
01:32:38 If keeping my money as US DT in a Kucoin account,
01:32:41 you know, just for example, if that makes, you know, 30 percent a year,
01:32:45 then that's objectively better than keeping it in a bank
01:32:48 that makes like less than one percent a year.
01:32:50 So it seems like, OK, obviously I should do that.
01:32:53 But like if I put all of my money into US DT on Kucoin, it's like,
01:32:57 what if that app just fails?
01:32:58 Like what if US DT becomes like what if it was a problem with the tether
01:33:02 and the currency crashes?
01:33:04 Like that's that's too risky.
01:33:06 So it's like, I can't do it.
01:33:08 I can't make the optimal play here.
01:33:10 Because we're too scary.
01:33:12 We don't have enough money to invest.
01:33:14 To make a substantial return.
01:33:16 Give us investment capitals.
01:33:18 Well, even if I had a billion dollars podcast, I know you're even if.
01:33:23 Even if I had a billion dollars, if it was like, OK, well,
01:33:26 Kucoin can make me 30 percent versus a bank can make me one.
01:33:29 I would I would want to put all of it in there.
01:33:31 But like still, that would be risking it all.
01:33:34 And and that's stupid.
01:33:36 I mean, having it in the dollars, risking it all, because that can crash.
01:33:39 We all collectively need to start.
01:33:40 I guess that's the that's the number one thing.
01:33:42 I also like whenever people talk about their fear of like these other coins,
01:33:46 I'm like, yeah, but the real money is super unstable.
01:33:49 All right, this is what we do.
01:33:51 Are you ready? Here's my goal right now.
01:33:53 That's kind of true.
01:33:54 But like, you know, at least with the I mean, true, the dollar value
01:33:58 fluctuates and it can change and it can crash.
01:34:00 But like it has, you know, the only thing that keeps the dollar from crashing
01:34:04 is that the US government just prints more of it.
01:34:07 Like we're in danger.
01:34:08 Just print more of it.
01:34:10 Like, yes.
01:34:11 I mean, I know.
01:34:12 I know, I know, but look, but like it makes sense to have a little more faith
01:34:16 that like the dollar isn't going anywhere.
01:34:17 This is what we have to do.
01:34:18 We need to we need we need all the reward and none of the risk.
01:34:21 So this is how how it's going to go.
01:34:23 All right, we start a second podcast collectively, like the pro investment
01:34:27 podcast, and the way it works is that if you go to the Patreon for that podcast,
01:34:31 we take that money and we invest all of it.
01:34:33 And then every week we talk about how the investments are going.
01:34:37 So we just take our patrons money.
01:34:39 They pay us for the podcast.
01:34:40 We pick all the patron money, put it into investments.
01:34:43 And then we just talk about the middle man that is just taking their
01:34:47 investment, like if it goes to the no, no, no, no, they're they're paying us
01:34:50 to be the guinea pigs to figure out the strategy so they can take the rest
01:34:53 of their money and invest it the way we are.
01:34:55 Yes, that's smart, that's smart.
01:34:58 Wait, audience.
01:34:59 So it's like crowdsourced testing on stocks.
01:35:03 They wouldn't know what's going to happen to their money in our hands
01:35:06 until it happens.
01:35:07 Right.
01:35:08 And so they would need to put the same amount of money that they're giving
01:35:11 us to to the thing themselves.
01:35:13 Well, no, here's the thing.
01:35:14 Here's the thing.
01:35:14 If they just give it to us to invest, then they don't have to worry
01:35:18 about whether it goes up or down, right?
01:35:19 They know it's gone.
01:35:20 It's a learning experience.
01:35:21 They're insulated from that emotional pain.
01:35:24 Basically, like if you were going to invest by yourself, you'd be like,
01:35:28 well, I need to put like X amount of money into something that I can
01:35:30 afford to lose to see if anything happens.
01:35:32 But instead of doing that, instead of doing that learning experience by
01:35:35 yourself, you pay a fraction of that to four idiots on the internet and
01:35:39 we'll do it for you instead.
01:35:41 But then collectively, we'll have more money so we can make more legitimate
01:35:46 investments and have see how it plays out at scale better than any single one
01:35:50 of us could do individually.
01:35:51 And then collectively, we can gain a better understanding of the market and
01:35:54 drive all of our audience to a brighter tomorrow.
01:35:57 The procrastinators hedge fund.
01:35:59 Are we building?
01:36:00 You caught me, you caught me.
01:36:03 I mean, it makes sense.
01:36:04 It makes sense because like if people are pledging to something like that, then
01:36:07 like they have a little bit of stake in like knowing like, how are these investments
01:36:11 going to do on a rock and then they tune in and hear us say like, OK, well, the
01:36:16 part we put in Bitcoin, you know, it went up.
01:36:18 The stuff we put in Ethereum is state stable.
01:36:20 The stuff we put in GameStop went down.
01:36:22 So we're going to move it here.
01:36:22 We're going to move this.
01:36:23 We're going to change the percentages here and here.
01:36:25 I'm just thinking about how if like if my $100 in Bitcoin is now worth $500,
01:36:31 then if I had put the 30 grand of Radcon in there, that would now be worth.
01:36:36 Oh, I think about 150 grand.
01:36:38 I think about even my Dogecoin.
01:36:40 I could put all my money into Dogecoin.
01:36:42 I would have imagined.
01:36:44 Imagine how much we can make to do more radcons with if you just.
01:36:50 So I think the best plan of action would be to to get this investment capital.
01:36:55 Put it into something that grows because that's, you know, we can do that.
01:36:59 You can just play on that, make that happen.
01:37:02 Get all that extra money by a weed store and have that as the ground base.
01:37:09 The operation that people that anybody who just needs a job that we know can work at.
01:37:14 And then we get a literal growth market where we grow the weed.
01:37:18 Yes. And then we also get free weed.
01:37:21 It'll be perfect.
01:37:23 Dude, what if we just had our own country, the pro country?
01:37:26 That's what I'm trying to.
01:37:27 That's where I'm heading with podcast.
01:37:29 That's why PCP HQ is too small thinking.
01:37:31 We need to go big.
01:37:32 Yeah, I want to have all of the things that you can possibly have under the brand PCP.
01:37:39 There you go.
01:37:40 We'll have our own PCP broad brand.
01:37:43 Interbrinton hit.
01:37:46 God, no, no data caps.
01:37:48 We can bully concuss.
01:37:49 We'll invest so well that we'll become more powerful and concuss.
01:37:53 We'll have nukes and then we'll declare war on concuss headquarters.
01:37:58 How far away do you think we are until like warfare is waged between corporations and not countries?
01:38:04 It already is.
01:38:05 But like open.
01:38:07 They'll never be open war again.
01:38:10 Kind of already is.
01:38:11 There's open war right now.
01:38:12 No.
01:38:13 Where?
01:38:14 In like Afghanistan.
01:38:15 With who?
01:38:16 Between who?
01:38:17 With we're still in Afghanistan.
01:38:19 Are we fighting though?
01:38:20 Are we like shooting stuff?
01:38:22 Yes.
01:38:22 I don't know what we're doing, but we're occupying it.
01:38:25 I'm sure Joe's getting those drones ready to go right now.
01:38:28 He's like picking up where his bro left.
01:38:29 Fortnite is not a real, Fortnite is real.
01:38:34 You zap into Fortnite and you're actually controlling a robot that's in Afghanistan
01:38:38 and it's copying your movements exactly.
01:38:40 And everything you do in Fortnite is in real life.
01:38:42 Victory Royale just bodies strewn everywhere in the Middle East.
01:38:46 I just think that the reality is we are already living in Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
01:38:52 It's like already real.
01:38:54 Like it's not the future.
01:38:54 It's just now.
01:38:55 We're like Metal Gear Solid 2 at this point.
01:38:58 You know, like the Patriots.
01:38:59 Where's mine?
01:38:59 I think we're past that.
01:39:00 I feel like Metal Gear Solid 2 is in the 2000s.
01:39:02 Like we're already in the next stage.
01:39:05 Just most people haven't proceeded.
01:39:06 Well, I think we're probably closer to Metal Gear Solid 4 than Rising.
01:39:09 We don't have cyborg bodies yet, unfortunately.
01:39:12 Does that mean Death Stranding is in our future?
01:39:15 Yeah.
01:39:16 Death Stranding is Metal Gear Solid 6.
01:39:18 They never told you that.
01:39:19 Those don't actually take place in the same universe.
01:39:21 I highly doubt it.
01:39:22 It's not the universe thing.
01:39:23 It's the Kojima effect.
01:39:24 If he's so good at predicting what's going to happen.
01:39:30 They all do take place in the same world.
01:39:31 The real world that we are in.
01:39:33 They all actually happened.
01:39:34 It's all documentary from the future.
01:39:36 Even the ones that contradict each other.
01:39:38 Gotcha.
01:39:39 Yeah.
01:39:39 I mean, the world contradicts itself all the time.
01:39:43 We've learned a lot today.
01:39:46 I learned how to make the big bucks.
01:39:50 Wow.
01:39:52 Do we want to go to voicemails?
01:39:53 I guess.
01:39:55 Had to happen eventually.
01:39:57 Had to happen eventually.
01:39:58 Okay.
01:39:58 I've been gone for a while.
01:39:59 Have the voicemails gotten any better?
01:40:01 Has there been a golden age of voicemails in 2021?
01:40:04 The great thing about the voicemails now
01:40:06 is that they're all addressed to Ben.
01:40:08 Because he's the only person anyone could expect to be there.
01:40:12 That's somewhat true.
01:40:14 Ben is usually funnier to talk about.
01:40:17 The, okay, last week there was a bit of a kerfuffle
01:40:21 because a certain individual named Tommy Jay
01:40:25 was sending too many voicemails.
01:40:27 And then they sent one that really pushed me over the edge
01:40:29 and I got really upset.
01:40:30 And I want to acknowledge that Tommy Jay probably
01:40:32 had not heard all of the,
01:40:36 because of the delay between recording and uploading.
01:40:41 He had not heard the second episode in which I said like,
01:40:45 okay, funny joke, but enough's enough.
01:40:48 No, it's not funny anymore.
01:40:49 So, you know, it wasn't entirely their fault
01:40:52 that I got so upset.
01:40:53 However, I will be honoring my promise
01:40:55 to never play a Tommy Jay email again.
01:40:58 That much has not changed.
01:41:01 But I want to say, look at how funny,
01:41:03 funny misunderstanding.
01:41:05 But fuck you anyway.
01:41:07 Are you guys on speak pipe?
01:41:09 No.
01:41:10 I'll be there in one.
01:41:11 Can you, can you, can you pull up speak?
01:41:13 I guess I could just upload them to Discord
01:41:16 if you want me to.
01:41:17 Sure, yeah.
01:41:18 I don't know how to.
01:41:19 Where's the link?
01:41:21 I will, I will just put, I'll just put the fucking things.
01:41:25 Where did I, where did I save them to?
01:41:28 Here we go.
01:41:30 All right.
01:41:30 The first one is called, where did I put it?
01:41:35 First one is called, it is number two, seven, 18, two.
01:41:40 Here we go.
01:41:41 First one is called, no Nate, dot, dot, dot, dot.
01:41:45 All right.
01:41:45 Here we go.
01:41:47 Three, two, one, go.
01:41:51 Another episode without Nate, huh?
01:41:54 You know what that means?
01:41:55 No Nate, no not.
01:42:00 True.
01:42:02 Oh, I should say, but so last episode we talked about wanting to
01:42:08 do some funny rebranding for the new era and I was going to make a new banner
01:42:15 and I will have made a new banner for the channel by the time this episode goes up.
01:42:21 But it will already be out of date because I was going to make a joke banner about,
01:42:28 it was going to be me and Gib pointing backwards at the gravestone with the PCP logo on it and
01:42:35 laughing about it.
01:42:37 But it's already an obsolete joke because now there's four people on this episode.
01:42:41 So I'm still going to do that.
01:42:44 I'm still going to do that even though it's already pointless.
01:42:49 Sick.
01:42:49 Glad I ruined that for you.
01:42:52 But we said we will, if anyone wants to submit anything or send us anything,
01:42:58 use this, we still might do that.
01:43:01 Help us brand our channel.
01:43:03 Okay, the next one is called a do apology.
01:43:09 And there it is.
01:43:10 Three, two, one, go.
01:43:13 I'm sorry about the last voicemail.
01:43:16 I was only being a Nate had ironically.
01:43:21 Yeah, yeah.
01:43:22 Everyone's a Nate had ironically at first.
01:43:26 But then always.
01:43:27 And the disease sets him.
01:43:30 That's how it starts.
01:43:33 Okay, the next one is just called a Janess J N E S.
01:43:38 So three, two, one, go.
01:43:41 When best guy ever hears a voicemail from Tommy J.
01:43:52 Yes, I understand this one.
01:43:59 Oh, there's nothing to it.
01:44:01 Okay.
01:44:01 Well, why would Nate respond that way?
01:44:07 Wait, what was that music from?
01:44:09 I know it.
01:44:09 Kill Bill.
01:44:11 Okay.
01:44:12 Okay.
01:44:13 So it's the idea that if Nate heard a voicemail from Tommy J that he would hunt
01:44:17 him down and kill him.
01:44:18 Is that the implication?
01:44:19 He would have a thirst for revenge, boiling his blood, reddening his vision.
01:44:23 I will do that.
01:44:24 I will do that personally.
01:44:27 Next one is called.
01:44:30 Easy to confuse the two.
01:44:31 That would be so, that would make me really mad if.
01:44:36 Next one is called Cody three, two, one, go.
01:44:42 Ben, it's not racist.
01:44:44 It's really good.
01:44:45 It's not racist.
01:44:46 What does that mean?
01:44:48 He's implying that you're pretending that you said something that you were like,
01:44:53 it's not resused about that was a thing.
01:44:57 There was a thing a couple episodes ago.
01:45:00 I think the NE words, the ha ha word.
01:45:06 You know, the mean Ben.
01:45:08 I'm right about that.
01:45:10 I'm right about that.
01:45:12 Yeah.
01:45:12 I don't really care, but.
01:45:15 Man, it's so nice being away for so long.
01:45:17 I'll die on this hill and every attempt to argue against me is in complete bad faith.
01:45:22 I haven't heard a good one yet, including yours.
01:45:24 Fuck you.
01:45:25 That wasn't even an argument.
01:45:26 That was just a guy making noises.
01:45:28 Oh, you're like.
01:45:28 Fuck you.
01:45:29 You're arguing in bad faith.
01:45:31 Okay.
01:45:31 I'm sorry.
01:45:33 Next one is called the human guitar, the human guitar, the human guitar, the human guitar.
01:45:41 Three, two, one, go.
01:45:56 Oh, this is epic.
01:46:26 This is funny.
01:46:30 Is this guy a part of the league of Nate fuckers?
01:46:39 He is.
01:46:39 I knew it.
01:46:40 I knew it.
01:46:53 All right.
01:46:54 Oh, God, it just keeps going.
01:46:58 Okay, funny noise make me go live.
01:47:01 I'm so bad.
01:47:03 Tom and Trixie.
01:47:04 Tom and Trixie, you are out of the loop.
01:47:06 But last episode, last episode, we were introduced to the league of Nate fuckers.
01:47:13 All of the worst, all of the worst and most heinous PCP villains, them snakes and
01:47:19 a cluster punk kitchen at Al were joined with some freaks like the man with a thousand lones.
01:47:26 Everybody's ever used a crazy poise modulator in the league of Nate fuckers and even some new ones.
01:47:33 They're all going to fuck Nate.
01:47:34 If I was this Nate, I would be building a moat around my house.
01:47:38 If I was Nate, I would invest in Bitcoin now because Fiat currency isn't going to protect him
01:47:43 from the league of Nate fuckers.
01:47:48 Okay, the next one is also called human guitar, human guitar, human guitar, human guitar,
01:47:54 three, three, two, one, go.
01:48:13 It's for guillotine.
01:48:16 I'm sorry.
01:48:18 I deserve you deserve better.
01:48:21 You deserve better than the PCP.
01:48:36 Why?
01:48:37 I can hear myself being speech jammed.
01:48:42 I am being speech jammed at this moment.
01:48:46 It is painful.
01:48:49 Okay.
01:48:49 I like the human guitar.
01:48:51 I'm going to dig a trench under my house and live in it.
01:48:57 It's like, you know, a new Minecraft mode with a scary aura to it.
01:49:02 It makes this sound.
01:49:05 The next voicemail is called veggie pilled.
01:49:09 Three, two, one, go.
01:49:12 Are they supposed to be God's chosen people?
01:49:16 That's what the Bible says.
01:49:18 Oh, I bet they always followed God's directions.
01:49:23 You'd think so.
01:49:26 Is that from VeggieTales?
01:49:28 Yeah, it sounds like it, but I don't know what the point was.
01:49:31 Did you?
01:49:31 It's a funny clip, I guess.
01:49:33 Did I just hallucinate that time that the VeggieTales guys said that the vegetables
01:49:40 in VeggieTales don't have souls?
01:49:42 No, we learned that during a heckles for shekels.
01:49:46 Somebody was in the call with us talking about it.
01:49:49 Right, right.
01:49:50 They don't have souls.
01:49:51 Why do they care about God?
01:49:53 It's literally like they feel they want to save those who can be saved,
01:50:00 even though they can't, because they're not God's chosen and they don't have souls.
01:50:07 What kind of a God would make his most ardent followers unable to be saved?
01:50:13 So they put on this 3D vegetable puppet show as themselves acting out roles.
01:50:18 It's like, boy, I wish I had a soul so I could watch this as a kid and become a Christian.
01:50:23 Is that a metaphor for the people who did VeggieTales?
01:50:24 They've just done so much evil in the past that they feel they will be saved.
01:50:28 So they're just literally vegetables.
01:50:32 They're in a vegetative state and somehow can make a show as well.
01:50:35 There's too much for me to handle right now.
01:50:38 The next voicemail is called The Truth About Mage.
01:50:42 Three, two, one, go.
01:50:46 Mage is just purple nepeta.
01:50:48 Discuss.
01:50:49 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:50:53 I don't know who that is.
01:50:53 Yeah, nepeta is a homestuck troll.
01:50:57 Nepeta is green mage.
01:50:59 Just think of green mage and you'll understand nepeta.
01:51:02 Just green mage.
01:51:03 Sure, I guess that makes sense.
01:51:06 Next one is called Sonicoo 102 When Ben, When Is It Happen?
01:51:11 It is three, two, one, go.
01:51:15 Sonicoo 102 When Ben, When Is It Happen?
01:51:20 Yeah, I've already said I gotta do another thing before I release it,
01:51:26 but I will say.
01:51:26 How many layers deep are you in distractions?
01:51:30 Sounds like a lot.
01:51:30 You put 100 hours into a video game before finishing Sonicoo, so.
01:51:36 Okay, to be fair, most of that was spread out
01:51:42 for a while.
01:51:43 Not anymore, though.
01:51:43 That doesn't make it any better.
01:51:45 That's been about the last...
01:51:47 Noida has been most of the last two days of my life.
01:51:52 Think of what you could have done with those 100 hours.
01:51:54 I will exhaust it.
01:51:56 Oh, fuck you.
01:51:59 What could you have done with the time that you spent,
01:52:02 I don't know, what's something you like that's stupid?
01:52:04 I mean, to be fair, I fucking berate myself every evening before I go to bed
01:52:09 thinking about how instead of watching Ultraman,
01:52:11 I could have made the next Ultraman.
01:52:13 I think about that all the time.
01:52:14 Exactly.
01:52:15 So, I'm only holding you up to my standards.
01:52:18 I also fail to be.
01:52:20 You gotta get into a weekend situation where you're allowing weekends to be video games
01:52:25 to constantly non-stop, and then you do things on the week.
01:52:29 I can't let the man define my life like that.
01:52:34 When I try and schedule things out and keep the weekend free,
01:52:37 it's like, no, too many things will happen.
01:52:39 I can't let the man define my life like that.
01:52:41 I can't let the man define my life like that.
01:52:45 When I try and schedule things out and keep the weekend free,
01:52:47 it's like, no, too many things will slip if I don't do things on the weekend,
01:52:50 and then I collapse under my own schedule.
01:52:54 The weekend is just two days.
01:52:57 You could flip them.
01:52:59 I'm just saying, seriously delineate the time between,
01:53:04 I can fuck around to I am supposed to be doing stuff,
01:53:07 and stuff will get done more often.
01:53:10 Yeah, I know you're right.
01:53:13 I know that you're right.
01:53:15 But I hate it.
01:53:17 Yeah, unfortunately, I'm in the same boat.
01:53:19 I'm just too shitty of a person.
01:53:23 With regards to, before anybody asks on the next voicemail, the Brony lecture,
01:53:27 I'm either going to have to record a whole fucking bunch of extra shell stuff to put around it,
01:53:33 or just redo it.
01:53:34 So that's why I haven't finished it.
01:53:36 What purpose?
01:53:38 Addendums to it?
01:53:40 Addendums?
01:53:43 Not so much because I was wrong, but that I just don't like the tone of the lecture at all.
01:53:49 It was, the sentimentality of it is very over it.
01:53:54 Very like, I was trying to get the last anger I had out about the whole thing or something like that.
01:54:04 Why don't you just, I mean, why don't you just maybe put an addendum at the beginning?
01:54:09 That's what I mean.
01:54:11 There would be a reframing, and I'd have to add in a bunch of shit, too.
01:54:14 So I just missed a lot of stuff that I would have wanted, but I don't think it's that good.
01:54:18 You'd have to, though.
01:54:20 Yes, because it's not, first of all, I just don't even like it.
01:54:24 I would rather redo it, but if it could be salvaged, I'd just build a framework around it.
01:54:30 Why not just, I mean, yeah, put an addendum if you're like,
01:54:38 I don't agree with everything I said in this one.
01:54:40 I don't like the tone of it.
01:54:42 I don't know, just release it.
01:54:43 It's like a historical artifact.
01:54:45 I mean, you don't have to stand by everything that you said.
01:54:48 I mean, granted, remember, I am about to just literally take everything I've made off the Internet.
01:54:53 So like, to me, not much sense in putting that thing up when everything else is gone, you know?
01:55:00 I want it, though.
01:55:02 I mean, with that, I can send it to you.
01:55:05 The state it's in.
01:55:06 It has about 15 minutes of highly edited part at the beginning and then the rest, so.
01:55:12 I mean, okay, what's...
01:55:16 It just kind of sounds like you've fallen down a hole with it where,
01:55:20 if things continue as they go, they will simply never come to light.
01:55:25 I think it's, yeah, it's sort of like the way I had initially made it.
01:55:32 I mean, even just when I got home with it, I was editing the fuck out of it
01:55:36 to make it like very different feeling from how it like,
01:55:39 and to add lots of visual reference into the stuff I'm talking about.
01:55:44 But like, it's kind of disorganized and like, I don't know,
01:55:48 I guess I just wouldn't explain it the same way.
01:55:50 Like, just in general, the approach I took, I think that it didn't come out how I thought it would,
01:55:57 like when I created the board, you know what I mean?
01:56:00 Here's...
01:56:00 Sure, yes.
01:56:02 I understand, but here's what I think.
01:56:04 I think that, yeah, maybe, I mean, you wouldn't explain it the same way now,
01:56:09 but at the time, that was how you would explain it.
01:56:13 That's how you did explain it.
01:56:14 And I don't, and like, I don't know, if you wanted to re-explain it, you could just make a,
01:56:19 I mean, you could, you could, you could redo it if you wanted to,
01:56:22 and that wouldn't preclude like putting out the original.
01:56:25 Even if it's like, disclaimed with like a, you know,
01:56:28 this isn't how I feel about certain things anymore.
01:56:31 Right.
01:56:32 I just kind of like being able to see it again.
01:56:34 I'm trying to encourage you, I'm trying to encourage you to release it in some form.
01:56:41 And I mean, you don't have to, but...
01:56:43 You did that great big weed thing right at the beginning, it was incredible.
01:56:48 I mean, you might, you might not like it for whatever reason, and that's fine,
01:56:52 but like, I remember enjoying it at the time.
01:56:55 I feel like, I feel like people would enjoy it for what it is,
01:56:59 even if you've changed your mind on it at the time.
01:57:02 That's what I think.
01:57:03 I'm sure, I, I do agree.
01:57:05 I think people would enjoy it for what it is.
01:57:08 I don't enjoy it for what it is though.
01:57:09 Like, I, I look at it as like, I can, I can watch,
01:57:13 I guess I feel that way about a lot of my videos, like, yeah, they're good,
01:57:16 but they're just like boring or wrong, or like, I don't care.
01:57:20 So that's why, like, you know...
01:57:22 But so what though?
01:57:23 But so what?
01:57:25 You don't have to stand by any of it.
01:57:27 That's true.
01:57:28 I mean, that's why everybody, I mean, other people can re-upload all my shit.
01:57:31 Dude, what if we just put it on the PCP channel?
01:57:34 Well, all my videos, yeah.
01:57:35 No, not all, well, it's a lot of videos, but like, the lecture,
01:57:39 because it's supposed to be you.
01:57:39 I kind of expect that's where it would have been.
01:57:41 Yeah, that's what I thought.
01:57:43 Okay.
01:57:44 Probably.
01:57:46 I don't know.
01:57:47 I, I, I might still finish it, but I would much rather just redo it and do it better.
01:57:52 Um, get it as a trial run.
01:57:54 That's such a, that's such a trap though.
01:57:57 That's such a trap.
01:57:58 That's like, it is what it is and you can't be redone.
01:58:02 It happened, it happened in a very specific context that can never be replicated.
01:58:06 Sure.
01:58:06 I mean, it wouldn't be the same thing.
01:58:08 I would just do a different Brony lecture.
01:58:10 Like, that one's just, you just never get to see it.
01:58:13 Lost media, you know.
01:58:15 But it's got all of us there.
01:58:16 It's got Jesse and Munchy.
01:58:19 Uh, I don't think those two are going to come.
01:58:21 Come to like my, well, actually maybe they might come to a rack on five.
01:58:25 I don't know.
01:58:27 Munchy more likely than Jesse, but that was like a big Brony moment.
01:58:32 That was a brohoof moment.
01:58:34 I liked it.
01:58:35 Yeah.
01:58:37 Well, I'm sure I can salvage parts of it.
01:58:39 Like to throw in, to sprinkle throughout or something.
01:58:44 What?
01:58:46 I'm so like sprinkled throughout a longer, like second lecture.
01:58:49 You know what I mean?
01:58:50 Like, like if I did another one, I could incorporate parts of the original into it.
01:58:56 I, I don't see, do you even want to do a second one?
01:59:02 Uh, I'd be interested.
01:59:04 I mean, like I could, I think I would do a better job.
01:59:09 Uh, I think I, I feel like a second one is like, I mean, if you could, if you wanted to,
01:59:15 but like wouldn't it make more sense as like a, a second like rebuttal to the first one?
01:59:20 Like wouldn't having the first one exist, make a second one make sense?
01:59:27 And with it, like without that, like without the first one, the second one is like, what's it,
01:59:32 what is it even about?
01:59:34 I don't know.
01:59:34 The same thing except better done.
01:59:37 I don't hear.
01:59:39 All right.
01:59:39 I'm just, I'm, I don't think it would be better done.
01:59:41 You might like it more, but I don't think a redo would be better.
01:59:45 It would just be a different thing.
01:59:47 Okay.
01:59:48 That's fair enough.
01:59:49 Yeah.
01:59:50 Uh, all right.
01:59:52 Next voicemail, uh, is called, uh, where did I put it?
01:59:56 It is called deja vu, but it's relevant this time and I already put it in the chat.
02:00:02 Three, two, one, go.
02:00:04 Gip, you were talking in previous episodes about how Picross is really cool, except it
02:00:08 sucks sometimes at the very end when the board just happens to not be solvable and you're forced
02:00:12 to take a guess.
02:00:13 Um, I've had that same experience with Minesweeper and honestly, like, I know I've called in,
02:00:17 like, a meme-y way about this before, but from the way that you talk about Picross,
02:00:22 I feel like you would also really enjoy Minesweeper and Minesweeper.online has a no guessing mode
02:00:28 where the board is guaranteed to be solvable every time.
02:00:31 So, uh, yeah, I recommend that you go try checking that out because I think you would
02:00:34 really enjoy it.
02:00:35 That's Minesweeper.online.
02:00:37 It also has like quests and stuff where it has like different goals with like, oh,
02:00:41 try to solve it efficiently with like as few clicks as possible or try to solve it quickly,
02:00:46 like, in the quickest time possible, stuff like that, if you want to like spice it up.
02:00:51 So, uh, yeah, I think go try and do, uh, yeah.
02:00:56 I have played Minesweeper before.
02:00:58 The only thing I don't like about it, as opposed to Picross, is the default game mode
02:01:04 involves a timer to determine your score and I hate being pressured for time.
02:01:09 I would rather like sit at a puzzle for like three hours trying to figure it out than like
02:01:17 fail at rushing it and like, like, I would, I would sit at a, like a Picross, like a 25 by 25.
02:01:24 I've gotten bigger with the, with the Picross puzzles because I managed to do them correctly
02:01:29 and I was so fucking psyched when I did and I just keep the, on the Picross dot something
02:01:35 site, you can just go to like 30 by 30 and I'm working my way up to that and it's so
02:01:40 satisfying when I figure out one of those huge things with no mistakes.
02:01:46 Um, Minesweeper, I guess I could try it as long as it, like the timer just annoys me
02:01:51 because it's like, I don't want to be, I don't want to feel like I'm rushing.
02:01:54 I want to take as long as is necessary.
02:01:58 Isn't this the same guy, didn't this guy recommend us some other like,
02:02:01 play some game on a, on a website?
02:02:07 I think specifically he was recommending like,
02:02:10 a site that lets you play Minesweeper in certain modes that like,
02:02:14 would help with the issues you had with it.
02:02:16 That's what it seemed like he was explaining.
02:02:18 Was there, was this, was this guy like doing more like Minesweeper Apollogia before I,
02:02:24 this feels like it's revisiting a previous voicemail.
02:02:28 That's what I mean.
02:02:28 I think he was saying, oh this website allows you to play in modes that would get rid of
02:02:32 the things that you had as a problem with Minesweeper.
02:02:35 I died in two.
02:02:36 I do, I died in two.
02:02:37 Fuck this, sucks.
02:02:39 Well what?
02:02:41 I'm on my second round right now.
02:02:44 God damn it.
02:02:45 Well, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not indulging in this.
02:02:47 I'm not gonna humor this.
02:02:50 Next voicemail is called more like Mr. Poop.
02:02:54 Wait, didn't you, didn't you post two?
02:02:57 Huh?
02:02:57 There's one that's 48 seconds that we didn't play.
02:03:01 Oh god, you're right.
02:03:02 Yeah, okay, play the last one, not this one I just posted.
02:03:05 Yeah, yeah, the 48 seconds one.
02:03:07 It's called more like Mr. Poop.
02:03:09 Three, two, one, go.
02:03:11 Also, the problem with the ending of Mr. Boop is just that the themes aren't interesting.
02:03:15 Like, oh it was building up to how escapist fantasies are bad the whole time.
02:03:18 What, you don't need to explain to me that thinking you're married to Betty Boop is unhealthy.
02:03:22 That was the joke from the very beginning.
02:03:24 The appeal of early Mr. Boop was the absurdity of its presentation,
02:03:27 the absurdity of the universe, the way that lore is getting dynamically generated
02:03:31 as Alec improvises new ways to insert different characters.
02:03:34 Like, that's what was so interesting about it.
02:03:37 And once it becomes this meta thing that's all in the guy's head,
02:03:40 it just totally deflates all of that intrigue.
02:03:43 Doing something like that feels like the obvious route to ending a story
02:03:47 that involves a bunch of different characters from different franchises like this.
02:03:51 And it ends up not saying anything.
02:03:53 The only appeal is that it is meta.
02:03:56 And so it just ends up being unsatisfying for those reasons.
02:03:59 I completely agree.
02:04:00 Yeah, I couldn't articulate it, but yeah, it's a very good way, putting it.
02:04:05 Yeah, it's, I mean, on the one hand, I think, yeah, the real intrigue was like the,
02:04:11 all the weird, like, the weird jokes and like the non sequiturs and like the twists and turns
02:04:18 and like the new characters that would be introduced.
02:04:20 Like that was what made it funny and that was what made it interesting.
02:04:23 So really, like there is no like ending you could do with that.
02:04:28 That would like not fail to have that element to it, I guess.
02:04:33 But yeah, like the last, the last arc, the fourth arc,
02:04:37 the fourth chapter doesn't really have that because it's, it's, you know, it's,
02:04:41 it's building to the climax, which is really not what made the comic funny.
02:04:46 So yeah, I totally agree.
02:04:48 Let's go, good, good voicemail.
02:04:51 Next one is called Kringus Bingus Six.
02:04:56 Yes, three, two, one, go.
02:04:59 Hey, everybody, it's Kringus Bingus.
02:05:01 Yay, it's Kringus Bingus.
02:05:03 Normally I record these in my car when I'm driving around,
02:05:08 but this week I can't do that and that ties into my Kring for this week
02:05:12 because my car isn't working.
02:05:15 It's too cold or something and the battery isn't charged, I guess.
02:05:20 I don't know, but I Kringed about that real hard when I had to go somewhere
02:05:25 and then my car wouldn't work.
02:05:26 Yeah, yeah, agreed.
02:05:29 And what I binged at, what I binged, not what I binged at, silly,
02:05:32 you, I Kring at things and I binged things.
02:05:36 The thing I binged, I've been watching so much adventure time.
02:05:40 I've been watching like, I watch like four and a half
02:05:44 seasons of adventure time in like a week.
02:05:47 It's pretty crazy.
02:05:48 Less than, yeah, like a week.
02:05:50 It's almost as much time as I've spent playing Moida.
02:05:52 It's been pretty good.
02:05:54 It's a really good show.
02:05:55 I really like it.
02:05:57 Yeah.
02:05:58 Also, I just, if I can be serious for a moment,
02:06:03 Kringus Bingus has kind of been in a rough patch in their life.
02:06:09 Not Kringus, no.
02:06:09 And I would just like to say thank you for having me on the show
02:06:13 and, you know, having such a positive reaction to me.
02:06:17 Kringus Bingus.
02:06:18 And it's really brought a lot of light in my life.
02:06:20 We love you, Kringus.
02:06:21 It helps me that I can help you.
02:06:24 So yeah, Kringus Bingus out.
02:06:26 Goodbye, guys.
02:06:27 Goodbye.
02:06:27 Kringus Bingus loves you.
02:06:29 Kringus.
02:06:29 Yeah, we love you, Kringus Bingus.
02:06:31 We love you too, Kringus Bingus.
02:06:32 This is my first Kringus Bingus exposure, but I am so far impressed.
02:06:37 Kringus Bingus is an institution.
02:06:41 Yeah, I very much prefer Kring to a Kring.
02:06:45 Honestly, Kring is Kring.
02:06:51 Oh, God.
02:06:52 Fuck yeah.
02:06:54 Another masterpiece voicemail, another joyful visit from Kringus Bingus.
02:06:57 We've been blessed.
02:07:00 Next one is called, I don't know how to pronounce it,
02:07:04 Bwertkwap, B-W-R-T-C-U-O-O-P, number one.
02:07:11 Here we go.
02:07:12 Three, two, one, go.
02:07:15 Eleazar, you're my boy.
02:07:17 I need you to do me a small favor.
02:07:19 What I need is a jingle, because it's Ben's weekly reminder to catch up on one piece.
02:07:24 God damn it.
02:07:25 Ladies and gentlemen, Ben, please catch up on one piece.
02:07:27 Thank you.
02:07:27 Bye.
02:07:28 Okay, I should really do that.
02:07:32 Gabe, how's one piece going?
02:07:35 Uh, how far back are you?
02:07:38 What's going on?
02:07:40 I am at, I'm like kind of near the beginning of Wano.
02:07:45 I think like I just saw spoilers, by the way.
02:07:48 I just saw Kido's Dragon Form.
02:07:53 Oh, you're really early.
02:07:54 Yeah, there's a lot of this happening.
02:07:56 At the moment, there's, it's big fight moment right now.
02:08:00 There's a lot of big fights going on.
02:08:02 A lot of big people involved.
02:08:04 It's very epic.
02:08:06 There's a lot of big people in one piece.
02:08:08 They are.
02:08:09 They're huge.
02:08:09 It's pretty big.
02:08:10 It's pretty big.
02:08:12 It's big in its scale size and girth.
02:08:16 It's, it's, it's an acronym.
02:08:18 B-W-R-T-C-U-O-O-P, Ben's weekly reminder to catch up on one piece.
02:08:23 Got it, got it.
02:08:26 Well, if I catch up on one piece, then this segment will end.
02:08:28 So no need for a jingle.
02:08:31 Next voicemail is called Nine Year Old Anime Huge Titties Episode Two.
02:08:38 Nice.
02:08:38 I don't remember an episode one.
02:08:40 I remember.
02:08:41 It was, it was the, the, it was that, that one anime.
02:08:45 That one infamous one.
02:08:47 I remember.
02:08:48 Three, two, one, go.
02:08:50 I went ahead and researched the show with the big tid nine year old girl.
02:08:54 It's called Hinako Note and the girl's name is Ruriko.
02:08:57 And I was not hallucinating when she gets introduced in like episode four
02:09:02 and she gets knocked over and sprawls out on the floor.
02:09:05 We know it's not a hallucination.
02:09:06 The animators like took loving detail and accentuating the form of her
02:09:11 like well-developed nine year old body.
02:09:15 Yes, I know.
02:09:15 So I think these guys are like the, what is it called, pedophile virtuosos or whatever.
02:09:22 So these guys are the heroes.
02:09:24 This is a stupid voicemail because we literally said all the same stuff.
02:09:26 Not enough porn of her on the internet.
02:09:29 Dumb, useless.
02:09:30 I think he's saying that he remembers it and he found an image,
02:09:33 but now he's got him rewashed it and he's just saying it again.
02:09:38 Great.
02:09:39 Okay.
02:09:40 Next voicemail is called No Nut Nate based three, there it is.
02:09:46 Three, two, one, go.
02:09:50 You ever go back and listen to old PCP episodes
02:09:54 and hear Nate go on weird Ayn Rand rants and like just say a whole bunch of like cringy,
02:10:06 libertarian bullshit while simultaneously dreaming of living in you know post-scarcity
02:10:15 space communism like Star Trek.
02:10:18 Oh man, what a fucking dork.
02:10:21 Remember when you went to Jordan Peterson and shit and like still thinks that like Sam Harris
02:10:26 is the smartest guy ever.
02:10:28 Oh man.
02:10:29 Okay, no, this pisses me off.
02:10:30 Fuck you, dude.
02:10:31 You know why?
02:10:32 Because like we don't have any context into what you were doing fucking five years ago,
02:10:36 probably being like 15 and I don't know something dumb.
02:10:40 Imagine listening to a PCP episode more than once cringe.
02:10:44 I just think it's real fuck to come at how somebody was five years ago and be like,
02:10:48 Oh, remember when you fucking sucked and you're not you knowing he's not going to be on the
02:10:52 episode to defend himself.
02:10:55 I mean, he could be on any time he wanted.
02:10:57 Right.
02:10:58 But this guy knows he's not on the episode to defend himself.
02:11:00 No, I agree.
02:11:02 I'm totally with this guy in hindsight.
02:11:05 Weird utilitarianism is really just like a Randian objectivism.
02:11:09 That's what it always was.
02:11:11 It wasn't there's no hindsight needed.
02:11:12 He said so at the time.
02:11:14 Did he actually I don't remember.
02:11:15 I don't remember that.
02:11:16 He was like, yeah, I'm a Randian objectivist.
02:11:18 That was his stance at the time.
02:11:19 Lol, cringe.
02:11:22 I didn't even know what that was at the time.
02:11:24 So I didn't I feel like a lot of people saw like liked Jordan Peterson for a while there.
02:11:31 Like I didn't know about him until the backlash against him started.
02:11:35 So like I heard about him.
02:11:37 It's like clean your room.
02:11:38 It's like, yeah, yeah.
02:11:39 Like that that is good advice still.
02:11:42 Sure, sure.
02:11:43 But all the other stuff is pretty cringy.
02:11:45 I knew a guy in Georgia who told me that like he wanted to get his life back on track.
02:11:49 And he was he was like going to apply for a job.
02:11:52 And he was like he read this book by Jordan Peterson that had like, you know, really like
02:11:56 opened his eyes or whatever.
02:11:57 And at the time I didn't know anything about JP.
02:12:00 So I was like, okay, that's cool.
02:12:02 That's cool.
02:12:03 I would have had more to say about it if I knew more, but I didn't.
02:12:07 So probably good.
02:12:08 Probably good that this guy didn't like tell me that and it didn't go.
02:12:12 Don't you know that Jordan Peterson hates trans people?
02:12:15 And the like it probably wouldn't have been a productive conversation to have.
02:12:18 Right.
02:12:19 So I was spared.
02:12:20 I think the most like comforting thing that I've since learned since like initially
02:12:25 being exposed to Jordan Peterson is that at the time I remember a lot of people were watching
02:12:29 his content and I thought like on the surface level his stuff was like interesting and out.
02:12:33 But like my thing was like a lot of it just sounded like like like babble,
02:12:37 like just like big words strewn together and attempt to sound smart.
02:12:40 Yeah.
02:12:41 And then you read his book and you see the diagrams and you're like, oh yeah, this guy's nuts.
02:12:45 Well then like because I'm like perpetually self deprecating.
02:12:49 I was like, because like everyone in the comments like this guy's so profound.
02:12:52 I'm like, am I just like too retarded to understand what's going on here?
02:12:54 Just sounds stupid.
02:12:55 And then later on a bunch of people are like, actually everything he says is just kind of
02:12:59 sounds stupid.
02:13:00 And I'm like, oh, okay.
02:13:03 I feel a little better about myself that like I wasn't the only one who listened to this
02:13:06 and thought like it was just like techno babble.
02:13:08 I never looked into any of his videos.
02:13:10 I read 12 Boos for Life.
02:13:11 It wasn't a bad book.
02:13:12 It was just like so overly verbose.
02:13:14 And I was like, why is it so overly verbose?
02:13:15 I must be dumb.
02:13:16 And then I realized, no, it's just overly verbose.
02:13:19 I'm like, okay.
02:13:19 Yeah.
02:13:20 I think the first time I saw Jordan Peterson was on the H3 podcast and he took a big weed.
02:13:28 No, he took a huge vape.
02:13:29 Like Ethan had this like vape the size of a fridge and he took a big vape.
02:13:35 He was like, yeah, that's pretty good.
02:13:37 And I was like, who is this old man who's like a professor on H3?
02:13:41 That's kind of weird.
02:13:42 Was it weed vape?
02:13:43 No, it was just vape because he was do you vape nature or that stuff?
02:13:46 Well, Ben, every time you vape, you're just invoking Jordan Peterson.
02:13:50 I don't vape anymore.
02:13:52 They don't sell the, they don't sell pods anymore.
02:13:54 I cannot find them on the internet.
02:13:56 They're just like, how is it still a thing that's happening in Massachusetts?
02:14:00 I don't think it's not just Massachusetts.
02:14:02 I can't find them anywhere online.
02:14:04 Really?
02:14:04 I don't know if I'm, I've like, I've looked around and I cannot find a online retailer
02:14:09 that still like has stock that is not sold out.
02:14:12 It's easy to get weed vapes and it has to get nicotine vapes now.
02:14:14 That seems not correct.
02:14:16 I don't know.
02:14:17 It's like, it's like they just have to be manufactured.
02:14:19 It actually seems correct just in a way that you can't believe our world would actually be.
02:14:23 Oh yeah.
02:14:23 That's what I mean.
02:14:24 That's what I mean.
02:14:25 In terms of like how the world works, not how the world ought to be.
02:14:28 I don't know if they're still like banned to be sold in Massachusetts.
02:14:32 I would imagine yes, probably.
02:14:35 The flavored ones anyway, but I don't know.
02:14:37 But cigarettes?
02:14:39 But nobody has them.
02:14:40 Still in any corner store.
02:14:42 But I like, whether they're real loud or not, nobody has them regardless.
02:14:45 So it's, it's a mood point.
02:14:46 Oh my God.
02:14:46 I'm genuinely baffled that like I can't find them online.
02:14:50 That's so strange to me.
02:14:51 I guess, I guess what we've learned is you just need to spend $2,000,
02:14:54 go to the Philippines, you can get like really.
02:14:57 You can buy individual cigarettes for like five pesetas there.
02:15:03 So, you know, which is like so little of a fraction of a cent that I couldn't compare it
02:15:08 to an American piece of currency.
02:15:11 Cool.
02:15:12 How many Bitcoin for a whole pack?
02:15:17 Okay.
02:15:18 Next one is Meow Mix 64.
02:15:22 Three, two, one, go.
02:15:26 You know, I'm just finished watching some creepy web series like Illusion Lock and Diminish.
02:15:33 Is there a creepy or haunted web series that you've enjoyed as well?
02:15:37 Thank you.
02:15:37 Wait, what was the series?
02:15:39 Diminished and what was the first one?
02:15:43 I'm not familiar with that.
02:15:46 I can't tell what the first one is.
02:15:47 It's not really creepy.
02:15:48 I've always championed Tales from the gas station.
02:15:50 It's like a, not ironic creepypasta, but like kind of like a meta creepypasta sort of thing.
02:15:55 And it's really good.
02:15:57 Highly, highly, highly, highly, highly recommend it.
02:16:01 Really, really good.
02:16:02 Wait, what was the genre of stuff?
02:16:04 Like just creepy anything?
02:16:06 Creepy or haunted.
02:16:07 He said haunted, but I'm assuming it could be anything.
02:16:10 Dude, I remember.
02:16:11 I honestly don't really know what that means if that's like a specific genre.
02:16:19 This is like my first poop the pants moment online.
02:16:24 My first poop.
02:16:25 My first poop.
02:16:25 Everyone remembers their first poop the pants.
02:16:29 It was this Newgrounds game series called Ghost Motel.
02:16:35 And this episode one, which is, it ends like a, it's a point and click series.
02:16:41 And you're just pointing and clicking and going around.
02:16:43 And it's very, it's Newgrounds.
02:16:45 So it's flash and it's like low fidelity, but it's sort of, it's really,
02:16:53 I don't know how to describe it.
02:16:54 It's gory and bloody, like as you would expect Newgrounds things to be.
02:16:59 But it's also quite creepy and unnerving.
02:17:02 There's a bit of like possession of a girl and you get, you just can't do anything.
02:17:08 You, you just have to watch this girl get possessed.
02:17:11 And as part of a scene and you feel like you have control, but you can't.
02:17:15 And then, and then he's like, man, I couldn't do anything.
02:17:18 It's like a scene happens after that.
02:17:20 It's like, oh my God, I really fucked up.
02:17:23 I don't really like creepy stuff and I don't like spooky stuff, scary stuff.
02:17:28 I tend to not be there, which is why I give Tales from the Gas Station just a glowing recommendation.
02:17:33 Okay. Oh God, what was it?
02:17:35 This is so embarrassing.
02:17:37 I, I, I, I heated, I literally, I've never done this before.
02:17:41 I heated a trigger warning.
02:17:44 Can you believe it?
02:17:44 Oh my God.
02:17:45 Was it, was it about brains?
02:17:47 No, it was just about jump scares.
02:17:50 There was, I think it was, I think it was a night, a night, night, not night mind.
02:17:54 Um, um, masterclass, nightmare masterclass.
02:17:58 I think it was a video or it was some channel that I followed.
02:18:03 They put out a video that was about something and they said like trigger warning.
02:18:08 You know, I don't do any jump scares in the video, but I will be showing the media in question
02:18:12 and it will contain some jump scares.
02:18:14 And I was like, well, I know that's going to fuck me up.
02:18:18 I hate that shit.
02:18:19 So I'm not going to watch the video.
02:18:20 Thanks for the trigger warning, buddy.
02:18:22 Yeah.
02:18:23 And I didn't watch it.
02:18:24 I guess I should give a trigger warning for the, the Ghost Martel,
02:18:27 because the first episode obviously feels like they didn't intend it to continue.
02:18:32 So it just ends in a jump scare.
02:18:35 Um, yeah.
02:18:36 But every other thing after that is much more like serious and cool.
02:18:41 I, yeah, I would, I, I think I would, I think I could probably live the rest of my life
02:18:48 without being jump scared.
02:18:50 And if I could, I would say yes.
02:18:52 Thank you.
02:18:53 Yeah.
02:18:55 Uh, I don't like to be scared because it's scary.
02:18:59 You mean you don't like to be startled?
02:19:01 Yes.
02:19:02 True.
02:19:03 Well, I don't like to be scared.
02:19:04 I don't like to be essentially frightened either to be, to be honest,
02:19:07 but I feel less like strongly about that.
02:19:10 Like if a trumpet goes in the night and I'm not expecting a trumpet,
02:19:14 then I'm going to, I'm going to run.
02:19:16 I'm going to pee in my pants.
02:19:19 If, um, I've said, I didn't like, I didn't really like, like Midsommar and it was,
02:19:26 that didn't have any jump scares in it, but it was like, it was scary, right?
02:19:29 It was like unsettling.
02:19:29 It was creepy.
02:19:30 I don't like it.
02:19:31 I don't like that I watched it because sometimes I think about it and it makes me sad, right?
02:19:36 And like, did that improve my life at all?
02:19:38 No.
02:19:39 So I don't like that either.
02:19:41 I, I agree with you.
02:19:43 I tend, that's why I haven't watched that movie and like a lot of ones like it.
02:19:48 It's just like when people tell me, oh, this movie is like a nightmare.
02:19:51 It makes you fucking feel haunted for the rest of your life.
02:19:53 I'm like, thanks, I've never watched that.
02:19:56 Yeah.
02:19:57 I mean, yeah, yeah, I don't know.
02:20:00 You can get desensitized to those things, but I don't want to do enough of it to do,
02:20:04 to get to that point.
02:20:06 Right.
02:20:06 It's, it's, it's not my cup of tea.
02:20:10 Next voicemail is called, it's Margar, three, two, one, go.
02:20:18 Margar here, Tommy J.
02:20:20 If you want to be a legitimate voicemail member like me and so many other esteemed members,
02:20:26 just be concise.
02:20:28 If you have a question, ask it.
02:20:30 If you have a bit, do it.
02:20:32 I am a successful voice caller many weeks in a row.
02:20:36 Don't send more than like two voicemails a week, or you're just going to be considered epic cringe,
02:20:43 bro.
02:20:43 True, true.
02:20:44 Margar, the esteemed.
02:20:47 Margar.
02:20:47 If anyone, this guy could write like a self-help book about like how to succeed at voicemailing.
02:20:53 12 rules for voicemails.
02:20:55 12 rules for voicemails.
02:20:57 Yes.
02:20:57 Yes.
02:20:58 Exactly.
02:20:58 Margar knows he's the expert.
02:21:02 I skipped, I skipped a voicemail.
02:21:04 Sorry, Eleazar, you might have to flip those.
02:21:07 Okay, the next one is actually the previous one, but there it is.
02:21:10 This one is called facial hair voicemail.
02:21:12 Three, two, one, go.
02:21:14 Facial hair is cool.
02:21:17 Did you bro?
02:21:18 Had a really cool beard and I'm going to miss it a lot.
02:21:21 Tom Oliver had a cool goatee at one point.
02:21:24 I have that same goatee like right now where it's not on the sides.
02:21:28 I'm going to just have a mustache and a chin bit.
02:21:30 Ben Sainte, I think you had a beard at one point.
02:21:33 It's true.
02:21:34 You can find evidence.
02:21:35 It was glorious.
02:21:36 It trans people.
02:21:37 Tell me about what you plan to do with your facial hair.
02:21:39 You going to laser it off?
02:21:40 Talk about facial hair.
02:21:42 I want to say I have, I've been feeling pretty good lately because I have actually managed to kind
02:21:48 of grow the beard back.
02:21:51 Infamously, sometimes I have to shave the beard because I pick at my beard and I like,
02:21:55 I'll pick too much of it out and it looks fucked up and I have to trim it.
02:21:58 I have managed to stave that off long enough that I actually kind of have a beard again.
02:22:02 It's not long.
02:22:03 You look good with the beard.
02:22:04 I'm just going to say.
02:22:05 I do look good with it.
02:22:06 I think I look way, way better with the beard.
02:22:07 It makes me really angry that I have this tick that like ruins my beard.
02:22:12 Yeah.
02:22:12 Which is like.
02:22:13 It's so crazy to imagine that you could pick your beard so hard to pull the hairs out.
02:22:19 All three of you have God tier facial hair and it makes me so mad because that's what I want.
02:22:24 Not anymore.
02:22:24 And I can't grow it.
02:22:25 I know.
02:22:27 I'm just me.
02:22:28 I'm shocked that anybody thinks that Digi Bro had great facial hair because in my opinion,
02:22:32 Digi Bro had a fucking air of cubes.
02:22:34 I am like coping so hard with the fact that I can't grow a normal beard that if I ever
02:22:39 did grow a facial hair, I would go full Gandalf to compensate at this point.
02:22:43 Well, Digi never like had.
02:22:45 Okay.
02:22:45 The Digi beard was very like scraggly.
02:22:48 I think it could have been like trimmed.
02:22:50 I think it could have been trimmed into a very like it could have been very,
02:22:54 very much, um, yes, yes meme guy.
02:22:58 You know what I'm saying?
02:23:00 Yeah.
02:23:01 You know, the blonde guy that says yes and he has a nice beard.
02:23:04 Oh, okay.
02:23:04 I know what you're talking about.
02:23:05 You could have done something like that with it.
02:23:07 That's kind of what I'm trying to do.
02:23:10 I'm gonna, I'm really trying.
02:23:12 What the tight curls.
02:23:14 I'm really trying to keep this streak going of not ruining my beard this time because every
02:23:18 time I shave it, I'm like, oh, I look so much worse and it makes me sad.
02:23:22 And it's actually taken me a long time.
02:23:24 It's been like, it's been several weeks.
02:23:26 It feels like it's been forever since I had a beard, even though I shaved it, like not
02:23:29 that long ago.
02:23:31 Um, I, I can't, I can't lose it again.
02:23:34 I can't lose it again.
02:23:35 It honestly, it boosts my self-esteem tremendously to have it.
02:23:39 And the inverse is also true.
02:23:41 So I have to protect it from myself.
02:23:44 If, if, if anybody like instead of like lasering your beard off, can you just like take your
02:23:49 stat points and beard and give them to me?
02:23:51 I will gladly accept that.
02:23:53 If I could, I definitely would.
02:23:54 Got it.
02:23:56 I got like some, at one point I got some like, uh, what's it called?
02:24:00 Like the fucking, um, like beard oil you can get to try and like grow your beard out more
02:24:04 and it didn't work.
02:24:05 And I was, it was devastating.
02:24:07 I, I give such an oil.
02:24:10 Yeah.
02:24:10 Like the oil, isn't the oil just for like styling it?
02:24:12 No, there's like some sort of like, forget what it's called.
02:24:15 It was some sort of like, what's the stuff that like makes you grow your fingernails?
02:24:20 Not melanin.
02:24:21 What?
02:24:21 I have no idea.
02:24:22 Biotin.
02:24:24 They say that like, if you, if you, if biotin, it like makes you, it like increases like hair
02:24:28 growth and nail growth.
02:24:30 That is the case.
02:24:31 Yeah.
02:24:31 I've been taking it as well.
02:24:32 But that's what they say anyway.
02:24:34 I think I took it for a while and I didn't see much difference, but it wasn't taken for that long.
02:24:39 Well, maybe I just need to inject biotin directly into my face.
02:24:44 Um, uh, I, I still have the good to know.
02:24:48 My facial hair hasn't changed in like a decade and I plan, no plans on changing it anytime.
02:24:52 Laser hair removal is very expensive.
02:24:56 But a Twitter user called 120 pounds of lean cave beef, uh, said that after doing it for
02:25:02 two years, they don't have any beard shadow whatsoever anymore.
02:25:07 So as far as I'm concerned, it's the only option.
02:25:10 Now we know the bit.
02:25:11 Soon as I can afford it.
02:25:13 I, I don't know.
02:25:15 I have no money.
02:25:16 So any amount is too much struggle.
02:25:19 I've also heard that it's like a session.
02:25:23 Like you go there every week for a number of months and it's like each session is like upwards
02:25:28 of a few hundred pounds.
02:25:30 It's definitely that's not cake.
02:25:32 It's not something that it was all told like two grand across two years to just on just the
02:25:38 facial hair.
02:25:38 Okay.
02:25:39 So I, I have, um, Jesus been using this, this handheld like consumer product
02:25:46 IPL laser hair remover, which, um, I don't know if I've talked about, um,
02:25:54 well, first off, I don't think it's supposed to be used for facial hair, but it,
02:25:58 because it says like, don't you, it doesn't really work on male facial hair because the
02:26:04 roots are very deep and it can't reach that far.
02:26:08 Okay.
02:26:08 But basically it's a, instead of a laser, it's a light bulb that pulses.
02:26:11 It's IPL stands for intense pulse light.
02:26:16 So it just zaps you with an extremely like quick and powerful light bulb zap and it hurts.
02:26:24 It's like slapping you with a, with a rubber band, but I've been using it on my arms and
02:26:29 legs and my arms and leg hair is basically completely gone, which is epic.
02:26:33 Okay.
02:26:34 Well, so it definitely works for most of the body.
02:26:37 Men and women can use it.
02:26:39 It's just that the male facial hair.
02:26:42 Actually, just link me the thing you got.
02:26:44 Well, it's kind of expensive as well.
02:26:46 The only reason I have it is because, um, a friend noticed that Black Friday last year
02:26:53 or the year before, oh no, it must have been last year, Black Friday, it was off by 70%
02:26:59 so I could afford it pretty easily.
02:27:03 I know the brand.
02:27:04 It's IPL Brown, like B-R-A-U-N.
02:27:09 That's the thing.
02:27:10 Yeah.
02:27:10 Like the brown tubes.
02:27:13 Yeah.
02:27:14 Yeah.
02:27:14 Yeah, yeah.
02:27:15 The ones you put on your car.
02:27:18 Yes.
02:27:18 I don't know what you're saying.
02:27:20 Oh, fucking 600 pounds.
02:27:21 Yeah, wait, that's a bit much.
02:27:24 I mean, cheaper than laser surgery.
02:27:27 No, I think it's definitely cheaper than laser surgery, but it's different from laser
02:27:31 surgery.
02:27:32 I don't think it could possibly permanently remove beard shadow, but it could definitely
02:27:38 get rid of body hair, which is what I'm using it for.
02:27:40 God fucking dammit, I've been losing it.
02:27:42 Mindsweeper non-stop since it's fucking since that call and every time I get farther and
02:27:47 more pissed.
02:27:48 This game does suck because you have to guess.
02:27:51 There is no mind sweeper game that doesn't involve guessing no matter how fucking far
02:27:54 you get in.
02:27:55 I would complain about the fact that it is inherent randomness, but I play like Pokemon.
02:28:00 I played Pokemon showdown a lot, so, you know.
02:28:03 Where's the thing?
02:28:05 They said that you can do a version that has no guesses guaranteed and I don't know where it is.
02:28:11 Okay, that's what they were saying then.
02:28:13 Did you?
02:28:14 Wait, how is that possible?
02:28:18 The fundamental mechanic of Mindsweeper is that it gives you limited information and
02:28:23 you have to make educated guesses.
02:28:26 No, it's that you use the numbers to determine
02:28:30 like, I don't think anything is a pure guess.
02:28:34 You always have enough information to figure it out if it is set out in such a way.
02:28:42 There's a subset of possible Mindsweeper maps that maybe start with one square already selected.
02:28:51 It's right there, no guessing mode on the left above ranking.
02:28:55 That's fascinating.
02:28:57 I wonder what the algorithm is, or what the rules defining a no guessing
02:29:03 Mindsweeper map is.
02:29:04 I don't know, but if I just match that out, I'm switching over.
02:29:08 I did a Mindsweeper earlier, and I just did it methodically, and I got all of the numbers
02:29:15 without having to guess once.
02:29:17 And it was only a medium, so it wasn't that big.
02:29:20 Oh, I don't even consider that Mindsweeper.
02:29:23 But like, you hit a thing and it's like, okay, there's a two there, and then it's like, well,
02:29:31 wait, how is there no guessing?
02:29:33 Because you know that there are a certain number of Minds,
02:29:36 but you don't know which squares they're in.
02:29:41 Don't you have to guess?
02:29:42 I don't think so.
02:29:44 Like, you use all of the other numbers.
02:29:46 You go for all the ones that are absolutely guaranteed, and I don't know.
02:29:51 I'm not a Mindsweeper person.
02:29:52 Is it Mindsweeper.online?
02:29:55 It's not that no matter what you have to guess in a match, it's just that the odds of you having
02:30:00 to guess at some point are so astronomically high that it's almost guaranteed to happen in most matches.
02:30:07 I mean, okay, I hit a button and it said one.
02:30:10 So I was like, okay, there's one in the surrounding eight.
02:30:12 So I have a one in eight chance of hitting a mine.
02:30:14 So I click another one and it says two.
02:30:16 So I'm like, okay, now there's, I know that there's one in the seven remaining surrounding
02:30:21 the first square, and there's two in the seven surrounding the two, and one of those two might
02:30:26 be in the, like this is still, it's, it's still guesswork.
02:30:30 It's like, it's like I can make a pretty good guess.
02:30:34 I, oh, I'm playing right now.
02:30:40 Okay, all right.
02:30:42 That's all I got to say about that.
02:30:43 Fuck Mindsweeper.
02:30:44 Anyway, yeah, laser hair removal is expensive, but the body hair removal is affordable kind of.
02:30:52 And that's what I'm doing.
02:30:54 I am experimenting.
02:30:56 I am experimenting zapping my face just to see if it does anything.
02:31:00 If it like reduces the speed or the thickness of it, that'll be handy.
02:31:06 So I'm going to do that anyway.
02:31:07 And apparently zapping with the IPL is just good for the skin.
02:31:11 Uh, you know, if you don't do it, if you do it once a week, then it's fine.
02:31:15 But if you overdo it, it's a bit much.
02:31:18 Well, I'm going to check it out.
02:31:20 The next voicemail is called Poopy Pie.
02:31:24 Three, two, one, go.
02:31:27 Do you guys remember when the universe weirdly aligned so that some random Swedish guy
02:31:37 screaming at Five Nights at Freddy became the biggest YouTuber on the platform?
02:31:45 And then he was universally hated by every like cool YouTuber.
02:31:51 Everyone knew that his content was bad and he wasn't anything special or good or cool.
02:31:59 I remember that.
02:32:00 Then do you remember when a couple of newspapers correctly pointed out like, hey,
02:32:09 this guy says some pretty wacky stuff and kind of kind of racist stuff.
02:32:17 And then all of a sudden all those YouTubers who hated him before were like, now hold on.
02:32:25 We think this guy's cool.
02:32:27 You're ignoring the fact that he did change his entire content.
02:32:30 That was pretty weird.
02:32:32 He became a completely different YouTuber in fairness.
02:32:36 I still don't watch PewDiePie.
02:32:37 I still think his videos are fucking boring and obnoxious.
02:32:40 What do you mean he changed his, did he?
02:32:43 Yeah, like after all that happened, he totally changed like the way he presents his persona,
02:32:47 the style of the videos and stuff.
02:32:49 Well, when you say all that, like how, which controversial you're talking about
02:32:54 and how early there's so many I don't actually know.
02:32:57 I hear about PewDiePie from my brother.
02:32:59 I don't know.
02:33:00 Okay, but that's not the reason why people turned around from like hating on him to
02:33:07 defending him.
02:33:08 It was because he came under fire from traditional media.
02:33:11 I mean, maybe YouTubers were defending him for that reason.
02:33:14 But like, for instance, Victor was never paying attention to PewDiePie until that happened,
02:33:20 but he started paying attention to him because out of the saga of him chronicling it happening,
02:33:25 he then developed like a vlogging style more based around like the content he was doing
02:33:30 to cover that.
02:33:31 And so like, it just was appealing to an older audience and was a more serious subject matter.
02:33:35 So like, a lot of people newly got into PewDiePie who never would have watched him before, you know?
02:33:41 I guess so.
02:33:43 Yeah, I mean, it got him a lot of exposure and it didn't actually do anything bad for him,
02:33:48 obviously, as these things, as these things always go.
02:33:50 Not in the long term, yeah.
02:33:52 Uh, next voicemail is called, uh, Erare, Prepare for Bear.
02:33:58 New mic call out if audio bad.
02:34:01 Okay, here we go.
02:34:03 Three, two, one, go.
02:34:21 That's the best voicemail I ever heard.
02:34:42 I'm glad we had a winner today.
02:34:44 How do I prepare for the bear?
02:34:45 No, you can't prepare for the bear.
02:34:47 No.
02:34:47 You can't prepare, you can't prepare for the bear.
02:34:51 If he wants you, he's gonna get you.
02:34:54 That's all, that's all there is to it.
02:34:56 Best bet is to leave out something he might want to eat more than you.
02:34:59 If you, if you can like, have a friend who lives even closer to you.
02:35:05 Do they sell bear traps on Amazon and how quickly can they deliver?
02:35:08 That's the question.
02:35:10 Get, get, get your friend, get your, get a friend to move to your city and be like,
02:35:15 hey, I found a great house you can move into and have it be like directly between you and the zoo
02:35:20 so the bear will get him first.
02:35:22 That's the only, what if he's going for you specifically though?
02:35:26 And, and when he moves in say, hey, listen, uh, I'm glad you're, glad you're here.
02:35:30 Uh, but, uh, just, uh, not for any, not for any reason, but if you were to,
02:35:34 if you're getting mauled by a bear, uh, call me and let me know about it.
02:35:38 Okay, uh, just give him that heads up, make it, make that part of the agreement.
02:35:43 Um, okay.
02:35:46 Good voicemail.
02:35:48 Next one is called, uh, Ben's Valentine Wish three.
02:35:53 There it is.
02:35:54 Three, two, one, go.
02:35:57 I, Ben, Saint, uh, am gay.
02:36:00 I am saying it now.
02:36:01 Now this is false.
02:36:02 Any, any claims.
02:36:03 Like we've been over this.
02:36:03 Any future claims to the contrary are, are just, are mere posturing.
02:36:09 This is a deep fake.
02:36:10 I'm just pretending, you know, I'm just keeping up appearances.
02:36:12 This is gaslighting.
02:36:13 It's a lie.
02:36:14 This is the truth.
02:36:15 I am gay.
02:36:15 This is not, can't.
02:36:16 Uh, don't let me fool you when I claim to be straight.
02:36:19 This is photoshopped.
02:36:20 Wait, this is you.
02:36:21 I should edit this out.
02:36:22 I should edit this out.
02:36:23 You sound so different.
02:36:24 I don't want anyone to know that I am gay, but I am gay.
02:36:26 Yeah, it's a different person.
02:36:27 Yay.
02:36:29 In fact, in fact, every Ben Saint from before like 2018 or whatever, or 2000.
02:36:35 You were killed and replaced for the crime.
02:36:36 Is a different person.
02:36:37 I was, I was, I was a Paul McCartneyed.
02:36:41 I was, I was killed and replaced with a, with a body double.
02:36:44 So that doesn't, that doesn't count.
02:36:47 The voice difference was so like uncannyly different that I thought just a person had,
02:36:54 was quoting you, like just saying the thing you said once.
02:36:57 I did very briefly think, wow, this is a really good Ben impression.
02:37:00 And then I was like, oh, I thought it was a terrible, I had no, I didn't even consider
02:37:05 there was, could it be an impression?
02:37:06 Like reverse Paul McCartneyed.
02:37:08 The body double was the original one and the original one is the double.
02:37:12 There used to be a Ben body double, but then I, then he killed, he was killed by the CIA
02:37:19 and the CIA called me up and said, Hey, sorry, we killed your double.
02:37:21 You're going to have to resume your regular duties now.
02:37:23 And I said, fuck.
02:37:25 And then here I am.
02:37:27 And that guy said, said he was gay on the internet and it's haunted me ever since.
02:37:33 Checks out.
02:37:35 I'll never escape from the shadow.
02:37:38 Okay.
02:37:39 So I hope that settles that for once and for all.
02:37:43 Next one is called Shin Megarfield Ten Spain.
02:37:49 Three, two, one, go.
02:37:52 Oh God.
02:38:04 It'll contain no great power, ancient knowledge, contain no great secret on it above all,
02:38:17 but one day I've been no center, sir.
02:38:22 Take control parentheses.
02:38:24 And now we're summarized summer.
02:38:27 Heart broken.
02:38:29 Divisional between the summer I summer and the great power.
02:38:35 Divisional between the rabble and the oneru.
02:38:40 Once a broom like a Sakura blossom.
02:38:44 Now a empathy like a bottle of sake.
02:38:50 And summer I not to talk about scroll.
02:38:54 No, no, no, no talk.
02:38:57 How I sucky scroll.
02:38:59 Neto son boy.
02:39:02 Samurai summer defect.
02:39:05 You never stop.
02:39:08 Of a net.
02:39:10 But until you next time.
02:39:13 I can't believe Samurai summer is in the League of Nate.
02:39:16 Samurai summer.
02:39:17 I can't believe you would.
02:39:19 I can't believe you would.
02:39:20 You would become my enemy like this.
02:39:22 So this is terrible, terrible news.
02:39:27 The League grows in power with every passing moment.
02:39:30 Wait, are the Nate fuckers pro-nate or anti-nate?
02:39:33 It's hard to tell.
02:39:34 They just want to fuck Nate.
02:39:36 They just want to fuck, like they all want to fucking for different reasons.
02:39:39 Like some of them are noble reasons and some of them are evil.
02:39:41 They're all they're only united.
02:39:43 The group hasn't decided if the fucking is metaphorically or literally yet.
02:39:47 Some of it is clearly literal.
02:39:49 Oh no, it's very literal.
02:39:51 It's explicitly literal.
02:39:54 But make no mistake about their intentions.
02:40:00 I want to say there's a video.
02:40:05 Cassidy uploaded a video condensing all the Samurai saga voicemails into a single video.
02:40:12 I retweeted it the other day.
02:40:15 Link in the description.
02:40:16 Why is that not on the fucking highlights channel?
02:40:19 We have clearly dropped the ball.
02:40:22 You know?
02:40:23 You know?
02:40:23 Maybe we did.
02:40:25 Maybe we fucking did.
02:40:28 Next voicemail is called Melonbread Rebuttal.
02:40:32 And there it is.
02:40:33 There we go.
02:40:35 Three, two, one, go.
02:40:37 Look, look.
02:40:38 Pancakes with craters.
02:40:39 You fucking do one of those.
02:40:41 This is Marin Pan.
02:40:42 I don't know what the fuck you were talking about last week about inadequate posturing.
02:40:46 But what I do know is, is that you made me feel called out and humiliated.
02:40:50 And like a fool.
02:40:51 So if you want to elaborate, let's communicate exclusively through PCP voicemails.
02:40:57 Oh, and by the way, listen.
02:40:58 By the way, I don't want to hunt Benzart work.
02:41:01 All right.
02:41:01 The only thing I want to hunt is Nate's utilitarian little boy pussy.
02:41:06 Motherfuckers know I want to utilize that Nate pussy.
02:41:12 He didn't say league though.
02:41:14 I think he's associating himself.
02:41:17 Maybe he's maybe maybe applied and they haven't got back to him yet.
02:41:20 Yeah, this is his application.
02:41:23 Do you remember what Pancake said about Mellon last time?
02:41:28 Marin.
02:41:29 Marin.
02:41:30 Marin Pan.
02:41:30 Well, this is, okay, but he wrote it as Mellon in the title of the voicemail, whatever.
02:41:38 Do you remember what they said?
02:41:39 Because I don't even remember what this is in regards to.
02:41:43 No, I can't.
02:41:44 But I guess they do so they can have their convo.
02:41:47 They definitely should do a back and forth entirely in PCP voicemails.
02:41:52 We'll stay an impartial observer.
02:41:54 I'll stay not knowing what they're talking about for as long as they want to continue.
02:42:00 Next voicemail.
02:42:01 We've got three more, by the way.
02:42:02 Next voicemail is called Tshepi.
02:42:06 T-S-H-I-P-I.
02:42:07 E-P-I.
02:42:08 Three, two, one, go.
02:42:11 I remember Benzart.
02:42:14 What?
02:42:14 This audio.
02:42:18 Can you hear anything?
02:42:19 No.
02:42:20 I hear thumping noises.
02:42:21 I don't know if this is intentional or not, but I'm assuming it's not a touch.
02:42:24 Is he sitting on it?
02:42:26 YouTube series.
02:42:27 I came to like YouTube poops one last time.
02:42:29 My version was called Martin the Lawrence.
02:42:32 So I was going to take clips of Sonic the Hedgehog specifically to set an M cartoon
02:42:38 and then just interject clips of Martin Lawrence.
02:42:41 I don't know how I was going to do that.
02:42:43 Martin Lawrence?
02:42:46 That's that.
02:42:49 I just wanted to also say, I'm going to have to go on your top.
02:42:52 That's even a movie.
02:42:56 I couldn't.
02:42:57 Okay, I heard YouTube poop, so I assume...
02:42:59 Something about making a YouTube poop out of Sonic the Hedgehog and clips of Martin Lawrence.
02:43:03 That's all I got on that.
02:43:06 I'm afraid for YouTube projects if recording with a microphone was this difficult.
02:43:12 You shouldn't have told us.
02:43:13 You should have just done it.
02:43:14 Now that you've said it, you won't do it.
02:43:17 Now that you've said it, it's over.
02:43:19 I mean, I was talking about an idea that I had for YouTube poop,
02:43:22 and I think he's just saying, oh, I also had one.
02:43:25 Here's what it is.
02:43:26 But obviously, we don't know how funny it would have been.
02:43:29 Now we'll never know.
02:43:31 Next voicemail is called Boopity Shoopity Fuck That Guy.
02:43:38 Three, two, one, go.
02:43:40 If someone sends in eight voicemails, Ben, you just have the right to not play them.
02:43:49 Just don't play them.
02:43:50 That's what I said I was gonna do for the record.
02:43:54 There have not been any Tommy J voicemails this week.
02:43:56 I have not had to censor any out in case any...
02:43:59 If there were any, I would have censored them out, but there weren't.
02:44:03 So in case you're wondering.
02:44:05 Um, last voicemail is called Addendum, three, two, one, go.
02:44:14 I have an addendum for my last statement.
02:44:20 Well, okay.
02:44:21 I'm sure we'll be glad to listen to it later.
02:44:24 Oh, wait, wait, one more.
02:44:26 We just got one three minutes ago.
02:44:29 Three, exactly three, three minutes ago.
02:44:31 Someone left a voicemail, so...
02:44:32 Is it the addendum?
02:44:33 Here it is.
02:44:35 No, I think it's a different person.
02:44:36 This one is called I'm Not Working.
02:44:39 Three, two, one, go.
02:45:04 I have an addendum.
02:45:08 I am so scared.
02:45:10 I gotta get one, go on and get one.
02:45:17 Doomer, we have you on YouTube for my music.
02:45:21 Hey, that was nice.
02:45:22 Yeah, that was good.
02:45:23 That was a good closing of the original PCP arc.
02:45:26 I imagined like the new banner like slowly fading in from like a big to like
02:45:30 zooming out to a full size as that's playing, you know,
02:45:33 it's the end of an era, walking away.
02:45:36 The only difference to the theme is that now it's nightcore.
02:45:41 Eleazar, make that the intro.
02:45:44 Make that the intro to this episode, and then we can end the episode
02:45:49 with the story of how it became the theme song for this episode.
02:45:56 Making it come full circle or something.
02:45:58 Yeah, I'll make a new banner and maybe then I'll just
02:46:02 make it replace it with something else in a week or whatever.
02:46:07 It's time to fuck around.
02:46:08 It's time to fuck around with the branding of this goddamn YouTube channel.
02:46:15 It's a bold new era.
02:46:17 It's a new year.
02:46:18 It's a new era of the PCP.
02:46:22 Okay, that's it.
02:46:24 Okay, that's all.
02:46:26 So really thought I could beat a Minesweeper match before this episode is over,
02:46:30 but alas, nothing but fucking failure.
02:46:33 The struggle.
02:46:38 You lost at the moment you decided to play Minesweeper.
02:46:40 I know, I always do.
02:46:42 Much like the stock market, you lost as soon as you decided to play.
02:46:46 Pick Rust is better than Minesweeper, and I guess Sudoku is better than Pick Rust,
02:46:50 but Sudoku's, I've mastered it.
02:46:54 I mean, some Sudoku's are really hard, though.
02:46:57 I know, and I'm good at them.
02:47:01 The confidence with which you say that makes me believe you,
02:47:04 because I would never dare to say that I was good at Sudoku's.
02:47:08 I mean, I've done a few, but not like the really bad ones, though.
02:47:13 Have you never found a Sudoku that you couldn't coup?
02:47:19 No, eventually I complete them.
02:47:21 I have an app that has easy, medium, hard, and I've run out of hard ones.
02:47:26 I need to download DLC for more.
02:47:29 DLC.
02:47:33 Yeah.
02:47:33 I mean, literally downloadable content, so.
02:47:38 I guess that's it.
02:47:40 I guess we're done with the episode.
02:47:42 We're almost at the three hour limit that Eliasar gave us, so that's good, lol.
02:47:46 A patreon.com slash the procrastinators bonus episodes.
02:47:51 Yes, yes, the behind the scenes.
02:47:57 Yeah, the behind the scenes clips episode is out.
02:48:00 Is it good?
02:48:00 I don't know.
02:48:04 The speakpipe.com slash pzp voicemail.
02:48:07 If you want to send us a voicemail, thank you.
02:48:11 And I mean, in patreon.com slash bensaint, obviously for me, just to give me money.
02:48:18 Me personally.
02:48:20 If you would rather give your money to me and get access to over 100 bonus podcasts,
02:48:25 which are all really good and they're gonna come out weekly instead of monthly, like these slackers.
02:48:30 patreon.com slash polystage2.
02:48:33 Baby.
02:48:35 Come on, man.
02:48:36 Come on.
02:48:38 Don't listen to that.
02:48:39 Bensaint Malarkey come over to me.
02:48:43 It's true.
02:48:43 The Bernie of Podcasts.
02:48:44 If you like Malarkey, if you like Malarkey, you should follow me.
02:48:48 You should support me over that comment.
02:48:51 Okay, goodbye.
02:48:52 Okay, that's the end.
02:48:54 Don't follow me anywhere because it's all going to go away.
02:48:57 Okay, day is dead.
02:48:59 There's a business strategy right there.
02:49:01 Yeah, I love it.
02:49:01 End of the episode.
02:49:03 Good night.
02:49:04 God bless.
02:49:04 Godspeed.
02:49:05 Goodbye.
02:49:05 Good night.
02:49:05 See ya.
02:49:06 Bye.
02:49:06 Bye.
02:49:07 Bye.
