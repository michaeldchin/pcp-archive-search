00:00:00 Hello everyone, welcome to another rowdy fuckers cop killers, where we're here and we're queer.
00:00:10 We're doing the same old shit, we're never gonna evolve past our primitive state and we'll just fucking die here, die among the fleas and the ticks.
00:00:19 I think we should, I think me and Munchy, I'm Ben Saint and I'm here with Munchy by the way, me and Munchy have decided that creative stagnation is the way to go.
00:00:31 We're gonna do the same thing forever.
00:00:34 Yes.
00:00:35 But we're gonna play Pokemon. We're gonna play some fucking Pokemon and fight each other.
00:00:40 Pokemon is all you need in life. It's like that NPC said, Pokemon encompasses all of my life and I'm okay with that.
00:00:47 Yeah, that fucking guy.
00:00:49 I truly empathize with him more than anyone else in my life.
00:00:52 He was, I was like, oh my god, I feel you bro.
00:00:56 Yeah man, no, I'm Munchy, I'm so fucking into Pokemon recently.
00:01:02 Dude, don't I know it.
00:01:05 Yeah, I'm way more into Pokemon now as an adult than I was as a kid, honestly.
00:01:11 That's because you were stunnows and you were just fucking gay but now you've evolved past primitive thoughts such as sex and now you can truly see what Pokemon offers.
00:01:20 And that's the ideal asexual world only operated through animal loving.
00:01:25 Yeah, yeah, that's true.
00:01:28 So I'm gonna accept your fucking battle and we're gonna have a fucking battle.
00:01:32 We're gonna have one heck of a good time destroying each other's valuable partners.
00:01:39 And I should really stop clicking on OBS because every time I do it records itself and does that like crazy infinite tunnel thing.
00:01:46 Yeah, you just ruined the entire video so.
00:01:49 Yeah, I broke kayfabe, now everyone's gonna know that this isn't real.
00:01:53 It's all just pixels on a screen, it's not even real.
00:01:57 They're gonna know that they aren't been saying looking at the screen. They're gonna step out of their illusion.
00:02:03 Yeah, it's gonna be like being John Malkovich but in reverse.
00:02:08 But even more deadly.
00:02:11 As if we didn't think it was possible.
00:02:14 Anyway, I have this one in the bag immediately.
00:02:17 Yeah, I have gay ones on my team. It doesn't even matter.
00:02:22 I didn't even look at my teammates. They're decent though.
00:02:27 Mega evolving right out the gate. You gotta save that for when the chips are down.
00:02:32 I didn't even realize that was clicked. It's been so long since I played this.
00:02:38 Oh my fucking god, actually now I'm scared. Now that you're double calm minded.
00:02:45 You know what? I believe in myself though.
00:02:51 I'm sturdy. I'm invincible. I'll never die.
00:02:56 That's what they said about gay people in the 1930s and guess what happened to them? They're all extinct now.
00:03:02 You know why? Because of me.
00:03:04 Oh yeah. Don't worry about it though.
00:03:08 Oh come on! Motherfuck!
00:03:11 I need to cool down. I need to simmer down.
00:03:14 That was real shitty dude. I really thought I was gonna get you with a fucking sucker punch.
00:03:20 I really thought I was gonna get you.
00:03:22 You really thought you were cool but little did he know that he was in fact the worst person ever to come out.
00:03:31 You know, I didn't, I think never mind. I was so confident.
00:03:37 When my Scarmory came out with Stealth Rock I was so confident. I was like, well this is this game's over.
00:03:44 The spiritual successor to whoever. What's his name?
00:03:50 I don't know. Oh Jacob. It was Jacob.
00:03:54 And now he's dead. Oh my fucking god.
00:03:58 That should be our first topic. You should go into how you've been feeling, how you've been dealing with the post-traumatic stress of being real life.
00:04:11 Oh yeah, since I've come out of the game.
00:04:14 You see since you've come out of the closet.
00:04:16 Yeah, I really expected to die in there. And you know, if you die in the game you die for real.
00:04:21 I really did not expect to be here living among the living right now.
00:04:26 You know, in that last fight against Getzis he killed all my favorite Pokemon.
00:04:33 I was really banking on Jacob. Jacob was like my guy. I was like this guy is gonna carry me through the whole fucking thing.
00:04:39 And I mean, I was sad to lose 12 but he wasn't as strategically important like I wasn't positive.
00:04:45 Yeah, he was a piece of shit that didn't matter.
00:04:48 Yeah, I mean I just given him low kick and low kick was really good.
00:04:53 Yeah, and it's not like he was a fighting type because it's a dark person that wouldn't have been helpful.
00:04:57 I think there was also a steel person.
00:04:59 No, there wasn't a steel person.
00:05:01 Okay, whatever.
00:05:02 I mean yeah, he would have been good against the black guy. I mean the dark guy.
00:05:08 Yeah, but I really wanted Jake. Oh, and Barry. So bummed to lose Barry.
00:05:15 Yeah.
00:05:16 The Electro, I don't know, whatever. But anyway, I fucking got all my crappy ass B team together when we won the day and it was amazing.
00:05:24 They were a fucking B team.
00:05:26 Oh, thanks for that.
00:05:28 That crucial catch of Voltix.
00:05:31 Yeah, thank God.
00:05:33 That crucial catch of Voltix.
00:05:35 Yeah, thank God.
00:05:36 Once you the Voltix was there in the box, you know, it had to be someone.
00:05:41 Yeah.
00:05:42 I was maintaining the fort.
00:05:44 Yeah, we wouldn't have had the confidence to go out there without you.
00:05:48 God fucking...
00:05:51 You just accept that you will never be cool.
00:05:53 I don't...
00:05:54 I'm the one who wears the sunglasses here.
00:05:56 You're gonna fucking sweep my old team with your first dude, dude.
00:06:02 No, well, I don't know. We'll see.
00:06:04 Uh-oh.
00:06:05 Yeah, this is bad for you. You're gonna die, dude.
00:06:08 Yeah.
00:06:09 Yeah.
00:06:10 That's what they fucking said in my dreams.
00:06:14 Aw, come on. Man.
00:06:21 Mew's the best Pokemon. You can't beat her.
00:06:24 You're one of those fucking people.
00:06:27 Oh god, wait, it doesn't even have a gender?
00:06:29 Yeah.
00:06:30 That's interesting. Okay, sure.
00:06:31 I want to have sex with it, too. Don't worry.
00:06:33 Yeah, don't worry, man. I'm not worried, man.
00:06:35 I'm not worried at all.
00:06:37 Oh, fucking god, dude.
00:06:38 I can't...
00:06:39 This is so terrible.
00:06:42 I was just...
00:06:44 I was just so fucking fixated on getting those stealth rocks and spikes out there that I was blind to what was happening right in front of me.
00:06:51 I was playing before and I had such a great win. I had like the coolest win.
00:06:57 You're walking through life with your fucking blinders on.
00:07:00 It started when they sent out their fucking Shedinja and I was like, oh shit.
00:07:12 I don't have anything that can hurt a Shedinja.
00:07:14 But I fucking swapped in for Taranitar with Sandstorm and the Sandstorm killed it.
00:07:19 Oh, holy shit.
00:07:20 It was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
00:07:22 Amazing.
00:07:23 Yeah, but then of course...
00:07:24 Holy shit, you're so fucked.
00:07:26 You're so bad at this game.
00:07:28 I can't believe it.
00:07:30 No, it's okay. I have knockoff. You're done.
00:07:32 Oh, shit.
00:07:34 Fuck, my last hope.
00:07:38 Okay, okay.
00:07:40 You're fucked, dude. You're so fucked.
00:07:42 What do you mean, man? I still have a chance, man. I still have a chance.
00:07:47 Rematch.
00:07:48 Yeah.
00:07:50 Okay.
00:07:53 Really, the moment you just completely obliterated the psychic type person,
00:07:58 I knew that you were going to just get through it with no problem.
00:08:02 You completely just fucking destroyed her and her family.
00:08:08 Well, I meticulously planned out my strategy for the Elite Four.
00:08:13 I knew exactly what that Musharna was going to do.
00:08:16 And I was like, okay, I'll send him out.
00:08:18 Toxic Spikes, two turns. He'll go to sleep for yawn, et cetera, et cetera.
00:08:25 But then, yeah, against the champion, I didn't have a real solid plan or anything,
00:08:31 so I was just like, well, I'll just do whatever.
00:08:35 And that's why I actually...
00:08:37 Ah, fuck's sake.
00:08:39 That's why people actually died against her.
00:08:42 Come on, man. Come on.
00:08:44 I have like a bin saint team with me, which is to say horrible.
00:08:48 Yeah, the bee team.
00:08:51 Uh...
00:08:54 I knew you were going to switch. I knew you were going to switch, dude.
00:08:58 Yeah, man, yeah. Ah, shit.
00:09:05 Yeah, I have like five Pok√©mon at the same time.
00:09:11 Well, I'll kill each and every one of them.
00:09:14 They're all done.
00:09:16 They're all done, dude.
00:09:18 Nothing can kill me, you know why?
00:09:21 What? Why am I trapped?
00:09:23 Because I'm the drill. Are you stupid?
00:09:26 Are you stupid?
00:09:28 Yeah, okay, I guess I'm fucked.
00:09:32 That's okay, I'm going easy on you.
00:09:34 Yeah, alright. I'm going to wake up this turn.
00:09:38 That's not how sleep works.
00:09:40 Yes, it is.
00:09:43 It might as well be.
00:09:47 Nice stealth rock, you fuck.
00:09:49 Thanks, dude. I learned it in school.
00:09:52 Yeah, that's good.
00:09:54 Yeah, boy! Ah, come on!
00:09:56 You are the worst human.
00:09:58 90% accuracy.
00:10:00 You are the worst human.
00:10:02 And I'm in fact the best human.
00:10:04 You see, for I was once an ape, and then when I was an ape,
00:10:08 I touched a magic fruit, and then it gave me superpowers.
00:10:12 I love how Ben is actually stupid. I love that part.
00:10:16 I forgot I'm slower than that.
00:10:20 I love that part.
00:10:22 I looked at Gallead's speed, and I was like,
00:10:25 oh, he's so fast, cool! Jesus Christ, alright.
00:10:29 That's my favorite part of this game, is that when Ben is terrible.
00:10:33 I felt so confident of going into this.
00:10:35 Alright, don't worry about it, though. It's all good.
00:10:39 Yeah.
00:10:42 I have no idea what to do right now.
00:10:45 There's nothing you can do.
00:10:49 Look at this man. Look what you're up against.
00:10:53 It's a fucking ice cube. I mean, Ice Snowflake.
00:10:56 Aw, god damn it!
00:10:58 LOL.
00:11:00 Guys, everyone type in chat right now,
00:11:03 like, now you're going to wait for the beat to be over.
00:11:05 There's no chat.
00:11:07 Type now, one.
00:11:10 I mean, if you want to stream this, go right ahead.
00:11:12 I'm like, we should do all GrannyFuckersCoptlers live sometime.
00:11:15 Yeah, we should. Yeah, why not?
00:11:18 Yeah.
00:11:20 Alright.
00:11:22 But actually no, because I don't want anyone to see me lose.
00:11:26 In real time.
00:11:28 So they can berate you in the present as opposed to in the future.
00:11:32 I was so confident.
00:11:35 Alright.
00:11:38 Now we're going to say who's the real champion of Yanova.
00:11:42 You fucking piece of shit.
00:11:44 I think so. I think...
00:11:46 Wait, what?
00:11:48 Oh, no.
00:11:50 Okay, okay, okay, okay.
00:11:53 It was all a farce. The nose lock was staged.
00:11:56 We saw that Max revived you, you piece of shit.
00:11:59 Yeah, okay. Did you see my fucking comment about the Max?
00:12:02 No, no, no.
00:12:04 Nate was all like, Ben, did you lie to us?
00:12:07 Was it all faked?
00:12:09 I was like, Nate, look.
00:12:11 I explained it in the comments.
00:12:13 He's like, yeah, but how do we know?
00:12:15 He was like pretending that he didn't believe it.
00:12:18 Well, explain what happened right now for video proof.
00:12:21 Okay.
00:12:23 This is going to be like Edward Snowden revealing NSA leak documents.
00:12:27 Can you just imagine Ben's face right up against the camera
00:12:30 in a not very well-willed room in Hong Kong?
00:12:33 Yes.
00:12:45 Okay, okay, fine.
00:12:50 God, I gotta fucking strategize and whatever.
00:12:53 So, yes, it was during EV training,
00:12:57 and I had to do...
00:13:00 Oh, God.
00:13:02 So bad.
00:13:04 I'm just, yeah.
00:13:08 If you were thinking about this, could this person really have not used a Max revive?
00:13:12 Could this person have one fair and square?
00:13:14 No, just don't lie to yourselves.
00:13:17 Alright. Yeah, dude, you fucking idiot.
00:13:20 Nice. Oh, God.
00:13:24 This means nothing.
00:13:26 This does mean nothing.
00:13:28 Oh, I got you, though. Oh, I fucking got you.
00:13:33 Alright.
00:13:34 Are you going to go for another sick sell?
00:13:37 No, of course not.
00:13:41 Don't be ridiculous.
00:13:45 Live on stream.
00:13:49 This is a deep round.
00:13:50 I can't even think to fucking defend my honor with this shit going on.
00:13:53 God fucking dammit!
00:13:58 I should have known you were going to do that.
00:14:00 It was the obvious move, and I...
00:14:04 And he's just dropping the bomb every way.
00:14:07 He can't even explain how he totally cheated, but he's not going to admit it.
00:14:11 I know. Oh, God, that's not even good. Why are you doing it?
00:14:15 It's not even good. Why are you doing it?
00:14:17 It's not even cool. It's not even good.
00:14:19 It's not even good. It's not cool. It's so stupid.
00:14:25 I'm going to freeze you, dude.
00:14:27 Nah.
00:14:28 I'm going to freeze you.
00:14:30 That's not fact-based.
00:14:31 That's not fact-based at all.
00:14:32 And you're going to have to switch.
00:14:34 It's not fact-based.
00:14:36 Fuck.
00:14:38 Anyway, so during EV training, I had to reduce my speed EVs,
00:14:45 and I didn't have tomato berries because the lady that sells berries,
00:14:48 she sells all the different kinds of EV reducing berries,
00:14:51 except for the fucking the good kind, the tomato berries.
00:14:55 And she was...
00:14:58 So I was like, I needed to reduce Christ.
00:15:01 I needed to reduce friendship somehow.
00:15:05 Oh, God. Here we go.
00:15:07 Hey, there we go.
00:15:08 Yeah, I got one.
00:15:09 You got one.
00:15:10 Yeah, I did. You're fucked now.
00:15:13 Yeah, except that you have a life orb on and you're going to die from next hit no matter what.
00:15:17 It doesn't matter. I'm going to take someone out with me.
00:15:20 Yeah.
00:15:21 Maybe I'll switch right out onto these fucking stealth rocks.
00:15:23 Yeah, right.
00:15:24 What do you think about that?
00:15:25 It's not a fact-based.
00:15:26 Maybe I'll just switch it up.
00:15:28 Regice? Not real.
00:15:30 Not real.
00:15:31 Not a real Pokemon.
00:15:33 Aw, I almost fucking got him.
00:15:35 What are you going to do? You're going to like substitute or something?
00:15:38 Nah, I would never do something so foolish.
00:15:41 Nah, I have more faith in you than that.
00:15:44 I don't know who's taller. I mean, faster.
00:15:49 Oh, it's me, of course.
00:15:51 Well, I won't.
00:15:52 Aw, God.
00:15:53 Nah, well, I'm going to fucking get you, though.
00:15:55 Whatever.
00:15:56 Okay, I'm improving. I'm steadily improving.
00:15:58 Steadily improving.
00:15:59 Steadily improving. I'm getting better.
00:16:02 So, the only way to reduce speed EVs at that time was that I had to go to Join Avenue and give my Pokemon haircuts and shit that raised friendship and reduced EVs.
00:16:11 But they wouldn't let me do it because all my Pokemon were at max friendship.
00:16:14 So off-camera, I went and got deliberately KO'd so that I could reduce friendship by one so that they would give me a fucking haircut.
00:16:24 And then I was like, that turned out to be really difficult and untenable and annoying, so I was like, fuck it, I will spend the five hours grinding.
00:16:32 Yeah, and I used max revives because I had all these revives lying around.
00:16:35 I didn't, I don't know, I just used the max one because whatever.
00:16:38 And then I decided to say fuck it and not do that and grind Join Avenue to get a good berry store and buy some sweet berries instead.
00:16:46 And that is the story of why I used a max revive.
00:16:50 And if you think it's cheating, then please crucify me.
00:16:54 Please come to my house and please kill me.
00:16:57 Please kill me. I don't want to live anymore.
00:16:59 If the people don't accept that I am the greatest Pokemon master of all time.
00:17:02 Well, after this, how could they?
00:17:05 No. No.
00:17:07 I didn't even kill all the Pokemon.
00:17:11 What are you, what? What is it?
00:17:15 Wow, this is a fair matchup. A furfrow.
00:17:18 Furfrow is good, dude.
00:17:20 No, but I have a Mewtwo.
00:17:22 Mewtwo is nothing. Mewtwo is garbage.
00:17:25 Mewtwo doesn't even have a single superpower.
00:17:28 He is not even good. Oh my team is crazy. Holy shit.
00:17:33 I'm going to win this time. Dammit, never mind, I lose.
00:17:36 Never mind, I lose.
00:17:39 That's it. That was my last chance and I blew it.
00:17:44 Do you have any closing statements? Where are you going to go from now?
00:17:50 Where am I going to go from now? Oh, I'm going to go to fucking Alola.
00:17:54 You know, my things didn't really work out with the whole Pokemon Genocide thing.
00:18:02 Turns out it's more complicated, so I've got to formulate a plan.
00:18:07 I'm going to go to Yunova and this time things are going to be different.
00:18:10 See, that's the perfect place because in Alola they don't have an elite force.
00:18:13 You can become the champion and Yunova, they had laws in place and shit,
00:18:18 but Hawaii is like a vast jungle with only ethnicities there.
00:18:22 So you can just assert yourself fully. Only ethnicities.
00:18:27 Oh, I get what you're saying. Yeah, god fuck.
00:18:34 It's a jungle like no other.
00:18:37 Yeah, I think guerrilla warfare will be the thing to do.
00:18:45 What can I even fucking do against this?
00:18:48 I don't know why you did that.
00:18:53 What, but brought out survivor? Yeah.
00:18:58 Bad options.
00:19:02 Yeah, okay. I wasn't convinced by Mewtwo, but if you've got pherothorn, I'm done.
00:19:09 Oh, whoa. What?
00:19:12 God, Christ. God, Christ.
00:19:18 Yeah, boy!
00:19:20 That's shit.
00:19:22 Ah, but I'm still, ah, fuck, whatever. That was only my opening move.
00:19:26 That was only my opening move. They don't even know anything.
00:19:29 No, no, nobody does.
00:19:32 Hmm, hmm, hmm.
00:19:37 Mewtwo is so crazy. Why is it even in the fucking game?
00:19:41 Oh man, makes me mad.
00:19:44 He didn't have a single stat under fucking 150. What the hell?
00:19:49 And he's got, don't forget his two mega evolutions.
00:19:52 Yeah.
00:19:53 Now those are some, now those are some Pokemon.
00:19:56 Those are in fact Pokemon.
00:19:59 Yes, it is true.
00:20:03 Anyway, you're done. You're fucking done, unless, unless you've got, oh, okay.
00:20:08 Oh, you're a fool, man.
00:20:10 Oh, yeah.
00:20:12 Oh, yeah, dude, yeah, bro.
00:20:16 No, call Corona. He's taking over.
00:20:19 Yeah, bro.
00:20:22 Get fucked, dude.
00:20:25 Now he's done. He's going to hurt himself because he's gay. Ah, shit. Okay, whatever.
00:20:29 Yeah, that was a tear. I don't know why I did that. I don't know why.
00:20:32 That was a good idea.
00:20:33 That was a weird decision that you made.
00:20:36 Oh, it's okay. I've got you on the ropes now.
00:20:43 I don't think this affects you, but I'm going to die anyway.
00:20:46 Yeah, whatever.
00:20:47 You are a ding-dong.
00:20:48 Well, I, I was going to die anyway. There's nothing I can do.
00:20:51 Sure, yeah.
00:20:52 Sure, yeah.
00:20:53 Wow.
00:20:54 Wow.
00:20:55 Oh, dear.
00:21:00 Check out this play. Check out this play.
00:21:04 No.
00:21:05 Oh, come on, dude.
00:21:07 Well, it doesn't, it's still fucking great. It's still the right move.
00:21:11 Dynamic punch is always the right thing to do.
00:21:13 Whatever. You don't even know how to fucking do anything.
00:21:16 So why should I even do anything?
00:21:18 Yeah, that's fair.
00:21:20 Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
00:21:23 There's one thing I think of when I look at Ben St.
00:21:26 What's that?
00:21:27 It's gullible and terrible.
00:21:30 Gullible and terrible.
00:21:31 I'm going to put those two words.
00:21:32 Oh, really?
00:21:33 I...
00:21:34 I'm going to put those two words on your tombstone.
00:21:38 Cool, dude.
00:21:40 I love it.
00:21:41 I love my official death.
00:21:44 Oh, no.
00:21:46 I hate that.
00:21:49 So, Munchy.
00:21:51 Wait, was there something else I said I wanted to say?
00:21:54 You want to talk about Sun and Moon generally.
00:21:57 And also, you've only said like three things actually about the Nuzlocke.
00:22:01 And you've just been getting distracted by fucking Pokemon playing.
00:22:05 It takes all my fucking concentration to play Pokemon.
00:22:08 What can I say?
00:22:11 Oh, god. What's he going to do?
00:22:13 What's he going to do?
00:22:14 What's he going to do?
00:22:15 He takes a breath.
00:22:16 Like, oh, okay, here.
00:22:17 I'm going to finally buckle down.
00:22:18 Oh, no. What's he going to do?
00:22:19 You know what?
00:22:20 I think I made the wrong move.
00:22:22 But we'll see.
00:22:24 Oh, no.
00:22:25 Return's never a wrong move.
00:22:28 Well, I won't say why I thought it was a bad move for a second there.
00:22:34 Of course not.
00:22:37 I might lose this, in fact.
00:22:39 I think so, yeah.
00:22:40 I feel good.
00:22:41 I feel like I've gotten the upper hand all of a sudden.
00:22:43 First, I was quite fast.
00:22:45 Faster than I would have imagined.
00:22:47 First row's good, man.
00:22:48 First row's good.
00:22:49 It's like a, it's like a, it's like a, I don't know, it's like halfway between a,
00:22:56 it's like halfway between a lie part and a, and a, oh, what's the other one?
00:23:03 Uh, I don't know, a Chansey?
00:23:07 Or a, or a Stoutland?
00:23:09 Stoutland, yeah.
00:23:11 Man.
00:23:12 See, that's why I thought, that's why I thought it was a bad move because I thought you were
00:23:15 going to switch into pherothorn immediately.
00:23:17 Yeah.
00:23:18 Yeah, that's what a smart person would do.
00:23:19 Yeah.
00:23:20 Which is what I am.
00:23:21 I vastly overestimated you, though.
00:23:25 Whatever.
00:23:26 And it's not even real.
00:23:27 Whatever you know me.
00:23:30 Clowns have to make their living somehow, and I make my living through murder.
00:23:33 So, you know.
00:23:34 Yeah, man.
00:23:35 That's how it is.
00:23:36 I mean, I feel that dog.
00:23:38 I feel that real, real hard.
00:23:40 You know what I'm saying?
00:23:41 Bro.
00:23:42 Oh, believe me, white person.
00:23:43 I know exactly what you're saying.
00:23:45 Yeah, white person.
00:23:46 Yeah, bro.
00:23:48 Um, hmm.
00:23:50 God.
00:23:52 I'm going to let you know that nothing you do will ever matter.
00:23:56 Well, this turned specifically, but in general, as well, just to let you know.
00:24:01 Anyway.
00:24:02 Just to clue you in.
00:24:04 Oh, no.
00:24:06 Oh, yeah, I did the right thing.
00:24:08 Oh, wow.
00:24:09 Oh, I did the right thing.
00:24:11 It's not like that never happens.
00:24:13 I always do the right thing, dude.
00:24:16 Every, every time.
00:24:19 Anyway, I released fucking Nuzlocke, and I was so happy because I fucking saw the whole
00:24:24 thing through to the end, and it was all great.
00:24:25 I think it was weaker at the beginning.
00:24:27 Like, I think it gets better as it goes on.
00:24:29 I think the ending is a masterpiece, and I'm really proud of it.
00:24:33 It's just a shame that I marred it with this Max Revive scandal that I'll never shake off
00:24:38 and that no one will ever, no one will ever let go.
00:24:41 The whole thing is ruined.
00:24:43 It's all, it's all trash.
00:24:46 Truly, I think, I think the problem was.
00:24:51 Yeah.
00:24:52 I mean, even watching the videos in the first place was the problem.
00:24:56 Watching them at all?
00:24:58 Yeah.
00:24:59 That we all suffered together.
00:25:01 Because due to the fact that we were watching them, you continued to make them, and thus
00:25:05 you let the greed and corporate interest go in your head.
00:25:09 Yeah, all the viewers hurt me by giving me false reasons to continue, and I mean, look
00:25:16 what's become of me.
00:25:18 Look what's become.
00:25:20 Look at me.
00:25:21 I'm, I'm an unfeasance, and it's depressing.
00:25:25 God.
00:25:26 Peer dove is such a cute Pokemon, but it's, evolutions are disgusting.
00:25:29 I don't, I don't get, is unfeasance supposed to be like gross, because it just looks like
00:25:34 a bird?
00:25:35 I mean, it's, it's pink head thing is weird.
00:25:37 Yeah.
00:25:38 But it's not like gross.
00:25:39 Well, I mean, that's fine.
00:25:40 Yeah, that gross thing about that is that what you just said, that it's gross.
00:25:44 Yeah, yes.
00:25:45 I don't know.
00:25:46 I guess I just don't find it that bad.
00:25:47 I think, I don't, I don't know if it's the male one, but there's another one that looks
00:25:50 weirder.
00:25:51 Yeah, yeah, the male one.
00:25:52 It's got a weird pink, like weird rooster tentacle head.
00:25:57 Hey man.
00:25:58 I think most of the gen ones, er, not the gen ones, see he gen paws weird.
00:26:01 Oh god, wait.
00:26:02 It's my, oh it's me.
00:26:03 I forgot that it was me.
00:26:05 Um.
00:26:06 Ben sainte, haul it up to production yet again.
00:26:09 Yeah, I know.
00:26:10 Oh god.
00:26:11 Oh no.
00:26:12 Oh no.
00:26:13 Oh god.
00:26:14 Oh no.
00:26:15 Oh god.
00:26:16 Oh god.
00:26:17 No.
00:26:18 Why?
00:26:19 I don't know man.
00:26:25 Get ready for the coolest Pokemon.
00:26:27 Oh my fucking god.
00:26:29 Yeah man.
00:26:30 Um.
00:26:31 Disgusting.
00:26:32 God, fucking paralysis.
00:26:36 Yeah.
00:26:37 Is the worst.
00:26:38 It's so bad.
00:26:39 It's so good dude.
00:26:40 It's so bad.
00:26:41 Like the power glove.
00:26:42 No I'm saying dude.
00:26:43 Oh I know.
00:26:44 Believe me.
00:26:45 No one could know more than I do right now.
00:26:51 I've researched every book on the power glove and I have concluded that I do know what you're
00:26:57 saying.
00:26:58 Shit.
00:26:59 I have concluded that I am indeed in the know of what you are speaking and or selling
00:27:04 to me.
00:27:05 Well that's just terrific.
00:27:08 That's just Stu.
00:27:10 Pendis.
00:27:11 Oh my god.
00:27:12 What am I going to do?
00:27:15 Bam.
00:27:16 Yes I got him.
00:27:17 Look how much I got him.
00:27:19 Oh fuck he had iron.
00:27:20 Ah nerd.
00:27:21 Ah you idiot.
00:27:22 Ah you stupid jerk.
00:27:23 Fucking real life isn't even real.
00:27:26 No.
00:27:27 I should have done that last turn.
00:27:29 Oh.
00:27:30 Oh I didn't even know I had that.
00:27:32 Yeah.
00:27:33 Well obviously.
00:27:34 You tell me.
00:27:35 Yeah.
00:27:36 You tell me.
00:27:37 I was thinking that too.
00:27:38 Whoever sleeps in your team on the nose lock.
00:27:41 What's the name?
00:27:42 The sleepy guy.
00:27:43 The sleep kid.
00:27:44 Who rests.
00:27:45 Fuck.
00:27:46 Wait what?
00:27:47 You were wondering who had it?
00:27:48 Like you knew someone had it?
00:27:49 Yeah.
00:27:50 Oh well.
00:27:51 I don't know.
00:27:52 Some idiot.
00:27:53 Oh well.
00:27:54 Nice use of protect.
00:27:55 Yeah.
00:27:56 I don't know.
00:27:57 I don't know.
00:27:58 I don't know.
00:27:59 I don't know.
00:28:00 I don't know.
00:28:01 I don't know.
00:28:02 I don't know.
00:28:03 I don't know.
00:28:04 I don't know.
00:28:05 Nice use of protect.
00:28:06 16%.
00:28:07 Nice second punch of dummy.
00:28:10 It's over.
00:28:11 It's so fucking over.
00:28:15 If FurFrow couldn't win.
00:28:17 Then nobody can.
00:28:18 Nothing can.
00:28:19 It's all over.
00:28:20 It is all over.
00:28:21 And now it's done.
00:28:23 Your fate is sealed.
00:28:25 I know.
00:28:26 Yeah.
00:28:27 Nice try.
00:28:29 Jesus Christ.
00:28:31 Oh I got you though.
00:28:34 Didn't I get you?
00:28:35 What the fuck?
00:28:36 I thought I turned one.
00:28:37 What the shit?
00:28:38 I thought I turned one.
00:28:39 Come on.
00:28:40 Bullshit.
00:28:41 10% chance to freeze.
00:28:42 That's crazy.
00:28:43 100% chance to thaw immediately.
00:28:44 That's crazy.
00:28:45 That's the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone I'm convinced.
00:28:59 There's collusion at play.
00:29:00 I guarantee it.
00:29:01 Yeah I think so.
00:29:02 There's mad collusion.
00:29:06 I mean I was colluding for sure.
00:29:08 For sure.
00:29:09 There's no question about that.
00:29:13 Ben, Max Revives Saint over here trying to act like other people are pulling something.
00:29:20 That is what they call me.
00:29:22 What up in?
00:29:23 It's like calling me on the streets.
00:29:25 Hey Max Revives come over here.
00:29:28 There's nothing I can fucking do against Farathorn with Thunderwave.
00:29:31 He's an invincible demon.
00:29:35 And that's it.
00:29:36 He's an invincible demon.
00:29:39 Yeah wow.
00:29:42 That was cheating what you just did.
00:29:44 That was cheating.
00:29:45 Well you see in the Arctic it's okay.
00:29:51 I'm probably Arctic.
00:29:52 Did you see my fucking toxic stall strats?
00:29:56 Yeah I did.
00:29:57 I was very proud of them.
00:29:58 Yeah man I was like this is it.
00:30:01 I gotta be as cheap as possible fighting this champ and it worked.
00:30:06 When you're fighting for Pokemon World Domination you gotta do what you gotta do.
00:30:11 Yeah you gotta do what you gotta do.
00:30:13 Someone in the comments was like you and Getsus aren't that similar.
00:30:19 You both think humans are valued humans over Pokemon and you both use bullshit you know
00:30:24 asshole strategies like toxic stall.
00:30:26 And I was like what come on.
00:30:28 I never asked for this.
00:30:31 That's what you get.
00:30:33 I know.
00:30:34 You're a tyrant Ben you have to realize this.
00:30:36 You are a tyrant over your YouTube channel.
00:30:39 Like at first I was mad like I didn't realize what I was doing was using the strategy of a villain.
00:30:46 But then I was like you know what I'm okay with that.
00:30:48 I like that.
00:30:49 I'm glad.
00:30:51 Fuck.
00:30:52 I think anyone who didn't realize that you are a villain right from the start needs to reevaluate things.
00:30:58 Yeah.
00:31:00 I got through paralysis but I just fucking missed.
00:31:03 Yeah well that's the reason death comes.
00:31:06 Oh no.
00:31:07 Why did I use so far?
00:31:10 I don't know I just picked it because I didn't care.
00:31:14 Why didn't I fucking rest?
00:31:16 Why didn't I rest last turn?
00:31:18 I had rest and I didn't use it.
00:31:22 What a crazy person you are.
00:31:24 I want to just end.
00:31:25 You know I could.
00:31:26 I could just forfeit.
00:31:27 Oh my god.
00:31:29 I should.
00:31:31 This is stupid.
00:31:32 No.
00:31:33 You don't know.
00:31:34 You don't know.
00:31:35 Dazzling gleam.
00:31:36 You don't know a thing.
00:31:37 You're a bitch.
00:31:38 You don't know a single thing.
00:31:40 I'm going to win the next one.
00:31:42 No.
00:31:43 No that's not possible.
00:31:45 It is possible.
00:31:46 Anything's possible.
00:31:47 No.
00:31:48 Even such a thing as that.
00:31:51 Christ.
00:31:52 No.
00:31:53 No.
00:31:54 No.
00:31:55 Terrible.
00:31:56 Well this should do the trick.
00:32:05 Come on furfrow.
00:32:09 Come on man.
00:32:12 Just give me this.
00:32:14 What?
00:32:15 I was using sucker punch.
00:32:17 That's just the faster one go first.
00:32:20 Yeah.
00:32:21 Oh gay.
00:32:22 See it's the one that straight goes first.
00:32:25 Oh yeah.
00:32:26 Pokemon calculates how cool you are.
00:32:29 Yeah.
00:32:30 Straightness being the major factor.
00:32:32 Yeah.
00:32:33 Major factor.
00:32:34 Major factor in that.
00:32:35 Yeah.
00:32:36 It's your secret trainer ID.
00:32:38 It's straight or gay.
00:32:39 It's your secret trainer ID.
00:32:41 It's your secret trainer ID.
00:32:42 It's your secret trainer ID.
00:32:43 It's your secret trainer ID.
00:32:44 It's your secret trainer ID.
00:32:45 The Pokemon showdown fanbase really did not like it when they added the feature that asks
00:32:48 you whether you're gay when you sign in.
00:32:53 Which immediately redirects you to a different website.
00:32:56 Oh shit I closed the thing.
00:32:57 I was supposed to rematch.
00:32:58 Oh don't worry.
00:32:59 Send me a thing.
00:33:00 Yeah here we go.
00:33:01 I got you fam.
00:33:02 All right munchie.
00:33:04 Yeah.
00:33:05 So this battle it's time for me to distract you.
00:33:07 Oh no.
00:33:08 And yeah tell me what you've been doing.
00:33:11 I have.
00:33:12 Because you, there's been talk, there's been talk that you might be at Radcon too.
00:33:17 There's the talk of the town, the word on the street on the grapevine,
00:33:21 that you might be at Radcon too this year.
00:33:23 Ben St. was walking down the street in his Brooklyn neighborhood
00:33:27 and he heard a faint whisper, a faint black ethnicity whisper
00:33:33 stating that much he may in fact be here soon.
00:33:36 Through sensual, through large but sensual lips, African American lips,
00:33:43 it was spoken, it was said on the street.
00:33:46 Well, that is true and somewhat closely related to the topic of I am making something.
00:33:52 Yeah, you're making a thing.
00:33:54 And I know very little about it, you've told me one or two things.
00:33:58 Yeah, which I will not go into in mass detail.
00:34:03 All you need to know is that alligators are cool and that's it.
00:34:09 Alligators are cool.
00:34:11 I don't think anyone would disagree with you about that.
00:34:13 Really, is that...
00:34:15 I know, I already know more than that.
00:34:17 Okay, okay, okay, I'll go into more detail.
00:34:21 Come on, what the f**king balloon, man!
00:34:26 You're so bad, it's crazy, it's crazy.
00:34:29 Yeah, but I got you though.
00:34:31 Oh, Patreon fame is bad.
00:34:34 I shot you.
00:34:36 He shot me.
00:34:37 I shot you, dude, you're dead.
00:34:39 Okay, well, it's hard to figure out what I should say and what I shouldn't say.
00:34:46 Not to the fact that, oh, f**k, I'm gay.
00:34:49 You gay, dude.
00:34:51 It's proof, okay, okay.
00:34:55 Undeniable proof that I do, in fact, love penis.
00:34:59 Yeah, true, yeah, it's true, dude.
00:35:02 F**k me.
00:35:05 I don't even know how to say that.
00:35:06 Okay, it's set in Miami, Florida.
00:35:09 The most villainous scum of the earth live there.
00:35:14 Yeah, totally.
00:35:16 No place on earth could possibly be as villainous and degenerate as Miami,
00:35:23 in my opinion.
00:35:24 I agree.
00:35:25 A close second did for Colorado.
00:35:28 Have you ever seen the Miami connection?
00:35:31 Yes, I have.
00:35:32 You have?
00:35:33 Okay, good.
00:35:34 Wait, that's the one with the guy he does that.
00:35:37 It's like one particular martial art?
00:35:40 Yeah, that's one thing.
00:35:42 It might not be called...
00:35:44 I know what you're talking about.
00:35:46 Yeah, I think it's the Miami connection.
00:35:49 My friend used to have this giant, beautiful poster.
00:35:53 He had this pride and joy.
00:35:55 It was this gorgeously painted, big, fully-framed image of the Miami connection.
00:36:02 Oh, you nerd, dude.
00:36:04 Oh, my God.
00:36:05 Oh, my God.
00:36:06 Oh, yeah, dude.
00:36:08 I can't believe this.
00:36:10 What a crazy person.
00:36:12 I tricked you.
00:36:13 I tricked you.
00:36:14 Do you think I was gonna ice beam or some gay sh**?
00:36:18 Maybe.
00:36:19 Yeah, well, shows what you know.
00:36:22 Anyway, you're f**king gay.
00:36:25 This is a story plain and simple about evolution.
00:36:29 Yes, it is.
00:36:32 Not to spell you on battle, but that as well.
00:36:36 Sh**.
00:36:38 I don't care if...
00:36:39 Okay, wow, it didn't raise to be cool.
00:36:41 Thanks.
00:36:42 I tried to trick you, but I didn't trick you.
00:36:44 What the f**k's up with that?
00:36:46 What the f**k's up with that?
00:36:48 Oh, my God.
00:36:50 Oh, sh**.
00:36:52 Oh, it's incredible.
00:36:54 It's unbelievable.
00:36:55 It's never been done.
00:36:56 It's beautiful when a plan comes into action.
00:36:58 That's not the line.
00:37:01 I love it when a plan comes together, you know.
00:37:04 The A team.
00:37:05 Don't even talk.
00:37:06 Ding dong.
00:37:07 Don't even talk, man.
00:37:09 Just don't even talk.
00:37:10 You little ding dong.
00:37:12 Okay, and by what I mean, it's about evolution.
00:37:16 Everyone knows that I'm an extremely pious man.
00:37:21 I know.
00:37:23 Believe me, I know, said Ben, rolling his eyes.
00:37:30 I'm a pious man, and as such, I...
00:37:34 Oh, you f**king nerd, dude.
00:37:36 I'm just so gay.
00:37:37 You're so gay.
00:37:38 I'm so gay.
00:37:39 I'm so gay.
00:37:40 You're just getting gayer every time.
00:37:43 Every single second goes by.
00:37:45 Every last one.
00:37:47 I'm auto-clicking on a giant cookie, but instead of a cookie, it's a giant dildo, and that makes me gayer.
00:37:53 Every single second.
00:37:54 Yeah, yeah, plus one, plus one, plus one.
00:37:56 Plus one, plus one.
00:37:57 One, one, one, one.
00:37:58 Everyone hit plus one gay in the comments.
00:38:01 Oh, that wasn't fair.
00:38:03 That wasn't fair?
00:38:05 Dude, it's f**king one.
00:38:06 Everything's fair.
00:38:07 Wait, is fighting ineffective against poison?
00:38:10 Maybe.
00:38:11 I forgot.
00:38:12 Yeah, I think it is.
00:38:13 Otherwise, that focus blast would have been super effective.
00:38:16 Yeah.
00:38:17 All right.
00:38:18 Oh, but no, I know.
00:38:20 It's resist fighting, but I'm also dark.
00:38:22 Just weak, so it...
00:38:24 Yeah, I know.
00:38:25 Yeah, yeah, I thought it was going to be super because you're dark, but it was, I guess,
00:38:29 bleh, poison, whatever.
00:38:31 Just read, dude.
00:38:32 Just read.
00:38:33 I know.
00:38:34 Well, if only I had a max revive to revive one of my Pokemon.
00:38:39 Wouldn't that be nice?
00:38:40 That would be nice.
00:38:41 That's what we all want.
00:38:42 That's what we all want in this life.
00:38:46 By the way, no one ever let that meme die.
00:38:50 Well, I mean, you can if you want to.
00:38:52 What the f**k, man?
00:38:54 For f**k's sake.
00:38:57 Whatever.
00:38:58 I'm f**king making progress here.
00:39:00 Yeah.
00:39:02 Worked out just...
00:39:04 Zoroarxoro...
00:39:05 Ah, come on, man.
00:39:07 That would have been hilarious.
00:39:08 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:39:09 Real funny, real f**k.
00:39:11 I'm f**ked.
00:39:12 I know you're f**ked.
00:39:16 Yep, yep.
00:39:20 God damn it.
00:39:21 Let's end this.
00:39:22 It wasn't supposed to be like this.
00:39:25 No, but it is like this.
00:39:27 And it always will be.
00:39:31 Whoa, what the f**k?
00:39:33 Oh, shit, man.
00:39:35 Okay, well, good game, idiot.
00:39:38 Yeah, wow.
00:39:39 It's not like, hey, you started like you cheated.
00:39:41 Haha.
00:39:42 I know.
00:39:43 No, I would never.
00:39:44 I would never cheat.
00:39:45 Anyway, you know what?
00:39:46 Okay, okay.
00:39:47 Like, yeah, the thing about the Max Survive, like,
00:39:50 yeah, you know, maybe...
00:39:52 Cheating.
00:39:53 You could call it...
00:39:54 Maybe some people would think that's cheating.
00:39:56 And those people are cordially invited
00:39:59 to please forgive me and I love you.
00:40:01 Don't be mad at it, friends.
00:40:03 But the...
00:40:05 But Nate.
00:40:06 Okay, Nate being the dick bag.
00:40:09 The dick bag that he is.
00:40:11 We all never trust Nate.
00:40:13 We have him from day one.
00:40:15 He's a sneak.
00:40:19 He's a creep.
00:40:21 He's a demon.
00:40:25 Jeez.
00:40:26 So, you know,
00:40:28 because nobody trusts him,
00:40:30 because of his proven status as scoundrel.
00:40:34 His corporate greed
00:40:37 and basically just everything horrible about him.
00:40:40 That's right.
00:40:41 Has been uncovered through data mining.
00:40:43 That's correct.
00:40:45 He wasn't just about like,
00:40:48 oh, the Max Survive, you know,
00:40:50 use it off camera.
00:40:51 Oh, cheating or whatever.
00:40:53 He was like...
00:40:55 He was like, dude, did you...
00:40:57 Does this mean, like,
00:40:59 you didn't beat the Elite Four?
00:41:01 Like, were you just faking the whole Elite Four?
00:41:03 Were you reviving your Pokemon between...
00:41:05 Like, first of all, it wouldn't even make sense
00:41:07 that I would use a Max Survive in between battles, right?
00:41:09 Like, if I was...
00:41:11 If I had cheated the Elite Four,
00:41:13 the way I would have cheated it,
00:41:15 was that I would have, like, you know,
00:41:17 scummed the battles and done them over and over again
00:41:19 until I won and then saved.
00:41:21 And I was like...
00:41:23 And he, like, pretended not to believe me
00:41:25 for a second or whatever.
00:41:27 But I was like...
00:41:29 Shit. I shouldn't have done that.
00:41:31 Shit.
00:41:32 And I finally, I was like, all right, fine.
00:41:34 I have the full uncut video.
00:41:36 I have the uncut footage of me fighting the Elite Four,
00:41:38 you know, legit.
00:41:40 I will upload it just for you.
00:41:42 But then he was like, no, I believe you.
00:41:44 But then I was like, why don't I upload?
00:41:46 So I think, actually, I already did.
00:41:48 I already uploaded it, but it's not available.
00:41:50 I want to, like, cut...
00:41:52 Because it's not just that there's a bunch of, like, stuff at the beginning
00:41:54 that's not interesting. I want to, like, snip that off
00:41:56 so it's just the Elite Four.
00:41:58 And I'll put, like, a little link in the description,
00:42:00 who wants to know how cool I am.
00:42:02 Anyone who wants to watch this obviously
00:42:04 doctored footage that I cut out...
00:42:06 Obviously doctored footage.
00:42:08 That I cut out when I revived my Pokemon.
00:42:10 Watch me, like, fuck around with berries
00:42:12 and, like, you know, switch around
00:42:14 move sets and stuff
00:42:16 for, you know, 15 minutes in between every battle.
00:42:18 You know, you're all welcome to it.
00:42:20 Mm-hmm.
00:42:22 You will never retain any credibility.
00:42:24 You'll never survive.
00:42:26 No matter what you do.
00:42:28 Ooh, that was bad.
00:42:30 That was bad.
00:42:32 Ooh, that hurt, though.
00:42:34 Dang.
00:42:36 Durant's fucking cool.
00:42:38 Yeah, I know. He deserves more praise in life
00:42:40 than he does. He receives.
00:42:42 Yeah, I have to agree.
00:42:44 Um, he's gay, though.
00:42:46 I don't like that.
00:42:48 I don't agree with that.
00:42:50 Kevin? Yeah.
00:42:52 I wish you could name all of your Pokemon
00:42:54 before going into Glorious Battle.
00:42:56 Even in a random...
00:42:58 in a random thing.
00:43:00 Uh, ooh, I got a lot of...
00:43:02 I got a lot of shit options here.
00:43:04 Yeah.
00:43:06 Well, it's fitting.
00:43:08 Because you're gay.
00:43:10 Yeah, I agree.
00:43:12 Check this out, Faggot. Oh, no.
00:43:14 Oh, but I won't have to.
00:43:16 But I won't have to.
00:43:18 Because you're a nerd.
00:43:20 All right, whatever.
00:43:22 I'm not even gonna...
00:43:24 I should've just done that right at the gate.
00:43:26 I'm gonna be a problem, isn't he?
00:43:28 Why did I waste all my good luck
00:43:30 on that successful sleep powder?
00:43:32 Ah, fuck.
00:43:34 Ah, dang.
00:43:36 Ah, darn.
00:43:40 Yes.
00:43:42 Just what I wanted.
00:43:44 Yeah, whatever.
00:43:46 My chest o' berry didn't mean anything.
00:43:48 Can't sleep, bitch.
00:43:50 It didn't mean anything to me.
00:43:52 Uh...
00:43:56 Yeah, we'll get...
00:43:58 get fucked here.
00:44:00 Ah, I knew you were gonna switch. I tricked ya.
00:44:02 I tricked ya!
00:44:04 Yeah!
00:44:06 Look at that.
00:44:08 Crazy. Look what I've done.
00:44:10 Uh...
00:44:12 Hmm...
00:44:14 Oh,
00:44:16 you're gonna be doing some nasty shit, aren't you?
00:44:18 Nah, I would never do that.
00:44:20 Yeah, I think you're gonna do some real nasty shit.
00:44:22 As I said before, I'm a very pious man,
00:44:24 and I would never use underhanded tactics.
00:44:26 You would never...
00:44:28 You would never do a toxic stall like me.
00:44:30 Yeah.
00:44:32 Yeah, like, no!
00:44:34 You would never be such a villain as this guy.
00:44:36 God fucking...
00:44:38 I can't believe this.
00:44:40 Throughout the nuzlocke,
00:44:42 he's been transformed more and more into snagly whiplash.
00:44:44 Wait.
00:44:46 Why did you go first?
00:44:48 You know.
00:44:50 No, I don't know.
00:44:52 I mean, you don't...
00:44:54 You don't have swift swim.
00:44:56 You're keogre.
00:44:58 Well...
00:45:00 How the fuck did you go first?
00:45:02 I'm just a fast guy.
00:45:04 No!
00:45:06 I'm a fast guy, Ben.
00:45:08 How...
00:45:10 Hmm...
00:45:12 I'm not sure about this one.
00:45:14 I'm unconvinced.
00:45:16 Well, you know what they say.
00:45:18 Come on, jump bluff.
00:45:20 Come on, do this for me.
00:45:24 Oh, you fucking nerd.
00:45:26 Oh, jump bluff.
00:45:28 Jump bluff.
00:45:30 So bad.
00:45:32 Why?
00:45:34 Oh, he's good.
00:45:36 Wait, what were you...
00:45:38 Oh, I think you were...
00:45:40 What were you gonna do?
00:45:42 So bad.
00:45:44 I was gonna do a single thing.
00:45:46 I think you were gonna do something.
00:45:48 I realized his head was like a xenomorph.
00:45:50 Um...
00:45:52 Dialga.
00:45:54 Dialga's so much cooler than Polkia.
00:45:56 Yeah, Polkia's gay.
00:45:58 Polkia looks so terrible.
00:46:00 Garrachina is where it's at, though.
00:46:02 Tell me more.
00:46:04 Oh, right, I was completely sidetracked.
00:46:06 About your gay thing.
00:46:08 Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
00:46:10 The high sci-fi setting of Miami, Florida.
00:46:18 Right.
00:46:20 In the distant future of the present day.
00:46:22 Yeah.
00:46:24 Yeah.
00:46:26 What's it fucking called?
00:46:28 The herptophon of the world,
00:46:30 meaning reptiles and amphibians.
00:46:32 Herptophon?
00:46:34 Yeah, no, herptophon.
00:46:36 Herptophon.
00:46:38 Herptophon, okay.
00:46:40 Yes.
00:46:42 That's the real term used by real people.
00:46:44 I believe it.
00:46:46 In their everyday life.
00:46:48 Yeah?
00:46:50 Is that a fact?
00:46:52 Yeah, that is a fact.
00:46:54 I learned it from www.com.com.
00:46:56 I learned it from
00:46:58 the wwe.
00:47:00 wwe.
00:47:02 wwe.
00:47:04 e
00:47:06 Blossom is so bad.
00:47:08 I hate it so much,
00:47:10 even though I love its design.
00:47:12 It's just so bad.
00:47:14 Um...
00:47:16 And they
00:47:18 evolve, not through conventional
00:47:20 means, but they hyper-evolve
00:47:22 using virtues.
00:47:24 Virtues.
00:47:26 Tell me
00:47:28 more about virtues.
00:47:30 Of course, of course.
00:47:32 Once a dirty,
00:47:34 disgusting to generate,
00:47:36 disgusting herptophon,
00:47:38 a member of that family
00:47:40 becomes aware of
00:47:42 through humans teaching it
00:47:44 or through finding out of their own
00:47:46 accords, the concept
00:47:48 of virtues, such as
00:47:50 chastity
00:47:52 and humility and justice.
00:47:54 Okay, yeah.
00:47:56 Once they learn
00:47:58 of these concepts,
00:48:00 they
00:48:02 evolve past their primitive
00:48:04 uh, their primitive
00:48:06 like the lowest rung on the
00:48:08 echeladder of
00:48:10 echeladder.
00:48:12 They're just shit, and they become
00:48:14 not shit by becoming cool,
00:48:16 and to become cool, you have to learn about virtues.
00:48:18 Virtues.
00:48:20 Okay, that's pretty much exactly
00:48:22 what you told me.
00:48:24 Wait...
00:48:26 I didn't tell you that at all.
00:48:28 Oh, I know what... Gigadrain did twice
00:48:30 because I lost flying type.
00:48:32 Oh, I forgot Roosted that.
00:48:34 Yeah, I mean, okay.
00:48:36 You told me about the main character,
00:48:38 but all you told me
00:48:40 about the main character
00:48:42 is basically exactly what you just described.
00:48:44 Like, so
00:48:46 like, before, I was like,
00:48:48 you were like, ah, yes, he is a reptile
00:48:50 of some description.
00:48:52 I won't spoil. What did what?
00:48:54 Who, you know,
00:48:56 who became
00:48:58 this new thing when he
00:49:00 discovered these particular virtues?
00:49:02 And I was like, haha, that's funny.
00:49:04 And then you just described, like, yeah, my story
00:49:06 is about a world where herptophon
00:49:08 have become cool things by discovering virtues.
00:49:10 I'm like, oh,
00:49:12 well, well, shit.
00:49:14 I should have known.
00:49:16 You should have known that. I'm too
00:49:18 slippery.
00:49:20 You're pretty slippery, dude. You're being pretty slippery right now.
00:49:22 I'm not gonna lie.
00:49:24 Not gonna lie.
00:49:26 Anyway.
00:49:28 We can say
00:49:30 he is an alligator.
00:49:32 Yes, yes.
00:49:34 The alligator.
00:49:36 The alligator.
00:49:38 The alligator to end all alligators.
00:49:40 I'm
00:49:42 I'm really
00:49:44 I'm really curious.
00:49:46 I'm really curious to see more
00:49:48 of these virtues, honestly.
00:49:50 That concept really tickles something within me.
00:49:52 What? It's because
00:49:54 you don't believe it, because it's true.
00:49:56 I don't know what I believe
00:49:58 anymore. That's terrible, by the way.
00:50:00 Yeah, I really wish I didn't die,
00:50:02 but it was a pretty good
00:50:04 it's pretty good trade, TBH.
00:50:06 TBH.
00:50:08 GBH.
00:50:10 GBA.
00:50:12 Game Boy Advanced.
00:50:14 To continue,
00:50:16 this alligator has learned specifically
00:50:18 of the virtues
00:50:20 of justice so far.
00:50:22 And he seeks to
00:50:24 better. Wait, wasn't there another one?
00:50:26 Was it
00:50:28 courage? I thought you said it was
00:50:30 courage and justice.
00:50:32 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Courage and
00:50:34 justice, but mainly justice.
00:50:36 Mainly justice.
00:50:38 And he seeks to fully
00:50:40 shut the fuck up, dude. It's not funny at all.
00:50:42 This isn't a comedy. I know.
00:50:44 I'm sorry.
00:50:46 It's nothing about this.
00:50:48 I'm head over heels in
00:50:50 serious mode right now.
00:50:52 I'm head over heels serious.
00:50:54 Oh
00:50:56 God, please. Yes. Yes, I did the right
00:50:58 thing.
00:51:00 It's not even cool.
00:51:02 So good.
00:51:04 It's ridiculous.
00:51:06 So good it's not real.
00:51:08 So good it's stupid as fuck.
00:51:10 What was I saying?
00:51:12 Oh, yeah, yeah. He
00:51:14 seeks to better, to first of all
00:51:16 to better himself and to
00:51:18 then in turn
00:51:20 spread these virtues
00:51:22 to fellow herptophon and
00:51:24 to humans too.
00:51:26 Because humans like
00:51:28 those fucking... Does he want to spread all
00:51:30 virtues or just the virtues that he has become
00:51:32 aware of? No, well
00:51:34 you can't really spread virtues. You have
00:51:36 a master yourself. Yeah, okay.
00:51:38 So he wants to conquer them all
00:51:40 and then spread them.
00:51:42 Like the patron saint
00:51:44 he is
00:51:46 the beautiful man.
00:51:48 So he's like a walking talking, he's like a
00:51:50 missionary of justice.
00:51:52 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:51:54 Incredible. Alright, I'm gonna lose.
00:51:56 It's over. You're definitely gonna lose.
00:51:58 There's nothing I could possibly do right now.
00:52:00 Anyway
00:52:04 Yeah, I might as well just fucking in my
00:52:06 fucking life right now. Yeah,
00:52:08 bro.
00:52:10 Kill yourself, bro.
00:52:12 No.
00:52:16 Humans are like...
00:52:18 they are privileged pieces of shit
00:52:20 and due to the fact that they are human
00:52:22 and that their ancestors have worked
00:52:24 to evolve in the past
00:52:26 some of them may give up the virtues
00:52:28 and stagnate
00:52:30 evolutionarily
00:52:32 and you can't go backwards.
00:52:34 You can only just be a piece of shit
00:52:36 and not help the human race
00:52:38 if you cast my drift.
00:52:40 I do.
00:52:42 So you don't like
00:52:44 turn back into a
00:52:46 whatever the shit form
00:52:48 of a human is.
00:52:52 A neanderthal.
00:52:54 So
00:52:56 he wants to again just
00:52:58 elevate everyone to a higher plane
00:53:00 and spread the
00:53:02 wonderful things that are
00:53:04 either these virtues.
00:53:06 Shit.
00:53:08 And to do so
00:53:10 he has dedicated his life to solving crime
00:53:12 and
00:53:14 helping those in need
00:53:16 and that's how he will spread his
00:53:18 message by corrupting
00:53:20 or bringing justice to this corrupt
00:53:22 world that is Miami.
00:53:24 This
00:53:26 disgusting wasteland
00:53:28 this filth
00:53:30 this fucking filth
00:53:32 that is Florida.
00:53:34 He will purify it.
00:53:36 Purify Florida.
00:53:38 Purify Florida.
00:53:40 Okay man.
00:53:42 I understand the premise
00:53:44 and the plot a little bit now.
00:53:46 What is it though?
00:53:48 What's happening?
00:53:50 That's the setting.
00:53:52 That's the setting and that's the premise.
00:53:54 You want to know what's going on
00:53:56 specifically in this
00:53:58 case.
00:54:00 Anything you feel like sharing.
00:54:02 Sure.
00:54:04 All I'm willing to
00:54:08 let out
00:54:10 is that there's a lot of
00:54:12 wine to see. There's mother going
00:54:14 along. There's fucking bitches doing
00:54:16 gay shit.
00:54:18 There's the giant web
00:54:20 Nate from
00:54:22 PCP owns a casino.
00:54:24 Right.
00:54:26 I think I remember
00:54:28 that detail or something like it.
00:54:30 Wait, so Nate
00:54:32 personally is in the store.
00:54:34 Okay.
00:54:36 That's interesting.
00:54:38 Well
00:54:40 he goes by another name to keep low.
00:54:42 Also fuck you.
00:54:44 Yeah!
00:54:46 That's a two in a row. Am I a genius?
00:54:48 That was my three in a row bitch.
00:54:50 Was that only three? Oh it's pitiful.
00:54:52 It's pitiful.
00:54:54 It's pitiful compared to the ten in a row streak
00:54:56 I'm about to embark on.
00:54:58 Yeah.
00:55:00 There's a lot of
00:55:02 people
00:55:04 are very apprehensive to learn of the virtues
00:55:06 as they believe
00:55:08 them to be old fashioned when in fact
00:55:10 they are new fashioned
00:55:12 and they are
00:55:14 they are fashion
00:55:16 weekly. They are incredible
00:55:18 and the main character wants
00:55:20 to spread that around like wildfire
00:55:22 and this
00:55:24 specific case starts out
00:55:26 as a kid mapping
00:55:28 eventually it evolves into something much greater.
00:55:30 Does a leggy dame
00:55:32 is he approached by a leggy dame?
00:55:34 Oh, of course.
00:55:36 One of
00:55:38 intense hysterics in fact.
00:55:40 Fan.
00:55:42 I like to hear that.
00:55:44 Yes, of course.
00:55:46 Yeah.
00:55:48 If you're picking up what I'm throwing down.
00:55:50 I totally am bro.
00:55:52 Of course.
00:55:54 I'm feeling it.
00:55:56 You know.
00:55:58 Okay.
00:56:00 I get the
00:56:02 I know what it is
00:56:04 story wise but it's a comic, right?
00:56:06 Yes.
00:56:08 It's a comic.
00:56:10 Okay, sweet.
00:56:12 What's
00:56:14 how
00:56:16 how long is it going to be?
00:56:18 Where will it
00:56:20 happen?
00:56:22 It will be released around
00:56:24 20 pages.
00:56:26 It's not going to be all done.
00:56:28 The entire thing I estimate
00:56:30 to be around 60 maybe?
00:56:32 60 pages, okay.
00:56:34 Maybe longer.
00:56:36 Probably not shorter.
00:56:38 Can I ask
00:56:40 how done is it?
00:56:44 All the pages
00:56:46 are
00:56:48 sketched out and now I'm doing the finals.
00:56:50 Shit.
00:56:52 Shit.
00:56:54 That's all I can say. Shit.
00:56:56 I'm so bad.
00:56:58 You're so fucked.
00:57:00 I'm going for 10.
00:57:02 10 in a row.
00:57:04 Well.
00:57:06 Now I know you're paying to me.
00:57:08 I'm just clicking oh.
00:57:10 That's a purple color.
00:57:12 It feels bad, right?
00:57:14 It feels horrible.
00:57:16 You did this to me.
00:57:18 You made this happen, dude.
00:57:20 That was wrong of me.
00:57:22 Whatever.
00:57:24 Come on.
00:57:26 All right.
00:57:28 How long did it take you to rough
00:57:30 the 60?
00:57:32 It took me...
00:57:34 No.
00:57:36 I know you've been working on this
00:57:38 while you've had school and shit.
00:57:40 I know you've got stuff.
00:57:42 Not everything is sketched.
00:57:44 The first block
00:57:46 I'm coming out with
00:57:48 so I have that much done.
00:57:50 To be honest with you,
00:57:52 I have only
00:57:54 really started like a month ago.
00:57:56 I've just been like, yeah, that's the thing
00:57:58 that's going to fucking happen, but I've only gone down
00:58:00 to brass 10.
00:58:02 I know you mentioned it a while ago,
00:58:04 but I only heard that
00:58:06 you'd actually started working on it
00:58:08 pretty recently.
00:58:10 Recently-ish.
00:58:12 Of course.
00:58:14 Yeah.
00:58:16 Really, all I had to do,
00:58:18 the drawing is easy
00:58:20 and writing is easy.
00:58:22 It only took
00:58:24 this shit.
00:58:26 It only took three days
00:58:28 to sketch all of it out.
00:58:30 Holy shit.
00:58:32 You...
00:58:34 I'm fucked.
00:58:36 That's incredible.
00:58:38 I'm jealous
00:58:40 that you could
00:58:42 just come up with all that shit
00:58:44 in so little time.
00:58:46 Yeah.
00:58:48 Most of it was writing
00:58:50 and I just had to...
00:58:52 Once I had all the speech bubbles in my head,
00:58:54 it was easy to just
00:58:56 make it interesting on paper.
00:58:58 I'm doing the Andrew Hussie
00:59:00 the Andrew Hussie way I
00:59:02 format my sketches.
00:59:04 All of them are on little boxes on one piece of paper.
00:59:08 Oh.
00:59:10 So they're like...
00:59:12 basically? Yeah.
00:59:14 Okay.
00:59:16 I don't know.
00:59:18 That still sounds pretty good.
00:59:20 I still think you're doing it faster than I would have.
00:59:22 Well, you know, I'm young blood.
00:59:24 Yeah, you are.
00:59:26 I'm basically old hat at this point.
00:59:28 Basically, just should die.
00:59:30 Absolute.
00:59:32 Absolute. Are you familiar with the broken mat saga?
00:59:34 What the fuck?
00:59:36 No.
00:59:38 I don't watch...
00:59:40 I don't watch the PCP.
00:59:42 You're not familiar with our work.
00:59:44 You don't keep up with us?
00:59:46 No, I'm not.
00:59:48 I just have to do with MatPat.
00:59:50 Did you get MatPat on a PCP episode?
00:59:52 No.
00:59:54 God damn it.
00:59:56 No, broken mat, the wrestler.
00:59:58 His brother, he went crazy
01:00:00 because his brother did something, I don't know.
01:00:02 Did something?
01:00:04 He did something or whatever.
01:00:06 Oh, how could you not know about this?
01:00:08 Yes, okay.
01:00:10 That's right.
01:00:12 I don't know who to switch into though.
01:00:14 Probably...
01:00:16 Wait, I know.
01:00:18 Damn it.
01:00:20 This is a great decision.
01:00:22 Nerd.
01:00:24 Damn it.
01:00:26 Whatever.
01:00:28 You don't even fucking have shit.
01:00:30 Yeah.
01:00:32 Nice choice scarf.
01:00:34 Brill.
01:00:36 Does fur evolve? It doesn't, does it?
01:00:38 No, it doesn't.
01:00:40 So that EVO light is useless?
01:00:42 Yes.
01:00:44 Alright, well, fine.
01:00:46 But yeah, it took me about three days
01:00:48 to get through that.
01:00:50 And I would say about the sessions I was doing it
01:00:52 is like seven hours.
01:00:58 Shit.
01:01:00 And then I would play Minecraft
01:01:02 for another seven hours, and then
01:01:04 that's it.
01:01:06 Good.
01:01:08 I actually do
01:01:10 want to go into specific detail
01:01:12 about Minecraft, because
01:01:14 be as multiple people
01:01:16 in watching this
01:01:18 right now. No, exactly what I'm talking about.
01:01:20 Something devilish. I have been
01:01:22 collectively performing
01:01:24 sacred rituals
01:01:26 in Minecraft.
01:01:28 Alright. Go on.
01:01:30 Go on. Finish it.
01:01:32 Finish it.
01:01:34 Finish it.
01:01:36 I'm so bad.
01:01:38 Yeah, dude.
01:01:40 You thought a burn would fucking stop me, bro.
01:01:42 I'm gonna fucking die.
01:01:44 You're gonna fucking die, dude.
01:01:46 You're a lost cause.
01:01:48 I'm a lost cause.
01:01:50 No.
01:01:52 Yeah, bro.
01:01:54 What the fuck are you thinking, dude?
01:01:56 I have a chance to laugh.
01:01:58 You think Keogre can do shit?
01:02:00 Keogre.
01:02:02 Ben Steele here can't pronounce words.
01:02:04 What is it? Keogre?
01:02:06 Keogre? Stupid.
01:02:08 I think Keogre sounds cooler.
01:02:10 Well, it's also not real.
01:02:12 Anyway.
01:02:14 Anything's real.
01:02:16 That's it. Everything's real.
01:02:18 What is important is Minecraft.
01:02:20 I'm about to explain why Minecraft is extremely
01:02:22 important to my current
01:02:24 mental state.
01:02:26 Sure.
01:02:28 It's time to say hello to my ultimate weapon.
01:02:30 Oh, okay. Oh, well, it doesn't even matter.
01:02:32 Okay, wait, shit, it matters.
01:02:34 Because I miscalculated.
01:02:36 In my brain, I got my calculator out
01:02:38 and in fact, it gave me a wrong one.
01:02:40 It was from 100 years ago.
01:02:42 Calculators didn't exist, so I didn't even
01:02:44 have anything in my hand.
01:02:46 Shit, I knew I should have Dragon Dance.
01:02:48 Oh, good, but it didn't matter.
01:02:50 Even Chancey was no match.
01:02:52 Even Chancey, wow.
01:02:54 Even the unstoppable Chancey.
01:02:56 The powerhouse that it is.
01:02:58 No.
01:03:00 Yeah, bro, was that four?
01:03:02 No, that was three.
01:03:04 Okay, okay, I've matched your streak.
01:03:06 Shit, no.
01:03:08 Yeah, all right, this one's for all the beans.
01:03:10 No.
01:03:12 This is where it gets real.
01:03:14 Anyway, I have...
01:03:16 Oh, wait, what the shit?
01:03:18 Did we just start two battles at once?
01:03:20 Yeah, we did.
01:03:22 Well, let's do them both at the same time.
01:03:24 Oh, shit.
01:03:26 All right, I'm down.
01:03:28 I'm completely down.
01:03:30 Yeah.
01:03:32 More down than you could ever know.
01:03:34 Oh, wait.
01:03:36 Oh, shit, shit.
01:03:38 I have to fucking...
01:03:40 That wasn't good enough.
01:03:42 That wasn't good enough at all, oh dear.
01:03:44 I have nothing.
01:03:46 Okay.
01:03:48 I didn't tell the story about Minecraft.
01:03:50 Oh, shit.
01:03:52 You've been hinting at something.
01:03:54 Yeah.
01:03:56 I have recently started playing Not Discovered.
01:03:58 Well, I have gone back into
01:04:00 a server that
01:04:02 has been
01:04:04 on the same map for six years
01:04:06 and
01:04:08 it has no rules
01:04:10 and it's completely vanilla.
01:04:12 Wow, wow, wow.
01:04:14 That may not seem like much to an outsider.
01:04:16 Those on the...
01:04:18 Those in the
01:04:20 vast and special Minecraft community
01:04:22 will note that most people
01:04:24 are extremely autistic and like to have
01:04:26 non-vanilla, non-PVP
01:04:28 shalom.
01:04:30 Some of these are gay and they like to build things.
01:04:32 Yeah.
01:04:34 But partisans and amazing people
01:04:36 such as myself like to kill people
01:04:38 for sport.
01:04:40 And as such,
01:04:42 I greatly
01:04:46 like things that
01:04:48 that server do the fact that spawn
01:04:50 is like a fucking wasteland.
01:04:52 Imagine if you set a bomb off on Tokyo.
01:04:54 That's what...
01:04:56 And Tokyo is...
01:04:58 I think about setting a bomb off in Tokyo
01:05:00 every day that I remember that
01:05:02 Fully Coolie 2 is still coming out.
01:05:04 Oh, oh, god.
01:05:06 No, I forgot about that.
01:05:08 Yeah, right. I forget about it sometimes too.
01:05:10 But then I remember and that's the worst day in my life.
01:05:14 Anyway,
01:05:16 it's deeply rewarding.
01:05:18 And the fact that has been up
01:05:20 for six years and extremely important
01:05:22 because of the fact that
01:05:24 so much history has been
01:05:26 enacted in these
01:05:28 hallowed halls of Minecraft.
01:05:30 It's a
01:05:32 digital...
01:05:34 It basically is more important than the United States
01:05:36 is what I'm saying.
01:05:40 I can believe that.
01:05:42 I'm sure it's better than
01:05:44 Trump's America.
01:05:46 No!
01:05:48 I told you not to talk about this.
01:05:50 Yeah, bro. We're doing it.
01:05:52 Aw, come on.
01:05:54 That was gay.
01:05:56 Nah, I should do that.
01:05:58 I'm talking about the bannet thing.
01:06:00 Why'd you have to do that?
01:06:02 It's stupid.
01:06:04 It's okay. I have an answer for everything.
01:06:06 Oh, nice stone edge, you fucking nerd.
01:06:08 Your Durant's done.
01:06:10 Fire Punch is unstoppable.
01:06:12 The bannet is unstoppable.
01:06:14 I'm winning both of these at the same time.
01:06:16 I'm just so on the ball.
01:06:18 I'm talking about Minecraft.
01:06:20 I know, right?
01:06:22 I fucking trapped you by making me talk about shit.
01:06:28 Shit, damn it.
01:06:30 Shit, god damn it.
01:06:34 This can't be happening.
01:06:36 I'm in charge here.
01:06:38 It's happening, bro.
01:06:42 Damn.
01:06:46 Wait.
01:06:48 Oh shit, you used wish.
01:06:50 No.
01:06:54 Nooo.
01:06:56 Boo.
01:07:00 Wait.
01:07:02 That's no problem.
01:07:04 Why didn't your wish come true?
01:07:06 Because I used it before, dummy.
01:07:08 Shouldn't it have come true this turn?
01:07:10 No.
01:07:12 I used it two turns ago.
01:07:14 No, you...
01:07:16 When did it come true?
01:07:20 Wait, is it going to happen now?
01:07:22 I don't think so.
01:07:24 I think it already came true.
01:07:26 No, no, opposed.
01:07:28 It doesn't say so.
01:07:30 I'm really confused.
01:07:32 Maybe you're just stupid.
01:07:34 Was it the taunt?
01:07:36 Did the taunt stop it?
01:07:38 No, no, of course not.
01:07:40 Of course not.
01:07:42 It's cheap.
01:07:44 It's cheap.
01:07:46 It says Max Revive Ben Sato right here.
01:07:50 That's not okay, dude.
01:07:52 Oh, come on.
01:07:54 Gay.
01:07:56 Gay, dude.
01:07:58 Look at this kid over here
01:08:00 trying to act like he didn't cheat.
01:08:02 Wow.
01:08:04 I never...
01:08:08 It's okay.
01:08:10 You know what?
01:08:12 I have to ignore
01:08:14 all of Munchie's hurtful rhetoric
01:08:16 and just concentrate.
01:08:18 His hateful propaganda.
01:08:20 Concentrate on crushing him where it counts
01:08:22 in Pokemon Town.
01:08:24 With Pokemon,
01:08:26 I mean with Minecraft,
01:08:28 I have been partaking
01:08:30 in recent activities with
01:08:32 most, like six people
01:08:34 from the piece...
01:08:36 From the
01:08:38 Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers
01:08:40 fan base.
01:08:42 There is no fan base
01:08:44 for the Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers.
01:08:46 It doesn't exist.
01:08:48 I am surprised
01:08:50 and alarmed if you're telling me
01:08:52 that that's not true.
01:08:54 Who are these
01:08:56 Minecraft fuckholes?
01:08:58 These Minecraft scoundrels.
01:09:00 Who are these Minecraft wizards?
01:09:02 You've been
01:09:04 you've been conjuring with.
01:09:06 Conjuring.
01:09:08 One of them is named.
01:09:10 Really close to the mic so he can
01:09:12 sample this exact...
01:09:14 This like three seconds I'm saying his name.
01:09:16 So he can sample this in his next
01:09:18 rap.
01:09:20 That one kid.
01:09:22 And Steel Viper
01:09:24 77.
01:09:26 Oh, I know Steel Viper. He posts
01:09:28 shit on the subreddit all the time.
01:09:30 I don't follow the subreddit because it's gay.
01:09:32 I mean
01:09:34 unfortunately the subreddit
01:09:36 is just our shit
01:09:38 being posted by people.
01:09:40 We haven't managed to elevate
01:09:42 to anything other than that yet.
01:09:44 It's a useful repository
01:09:46 if nothing else.
01:09:48 Yes, but I've seen Steel Viper
01:09:50 on there once in a while.
01:09:52 And we are
01:09:54 amassing arms to do
01:09:56 a great deed
01:09:58 and destroy everyone on the server.
01:10:00 And that's been occupying most
01:10:02 of my time as I value Minecraft life
01:10:04 over my real life. Like all
01:10:06 millennials.
01:10:08 Yeah.
01:10:10 Yeah, I mean probably.
01:10:12 Wait. Oh, air balloon.
01:10:14 Fuck, air balloon was popped. Why did I knock off?
01:10:16 I must be a
01:10:18 A true
01:10:20 idiot of unrivaled proportions.
01:10:22 I must just be a person
01:10:24 who is
01:10:26 going to be dead soon.
01:10:28 I'm
01:10:30 being so stupid right now.
01:10:32 I'm being so fucking foolish, dude.
01:10:42 Oh, no.
01:10:44 LOL.
01:10:46 I was ready.
01:10:48 I was ready to die.
01:10:54 You know what? I still
01:10:56 fucking am. Come on.
01:11:06 Whatever.
01:11:16 Yeah, okay.
01:11:18 Yeah, okay.
01:11:20 You win this round slow, bro.
01:11:22 Not even good, dude.
01:11:24 Not even fucking good.
01:11:28 And so Minecraft
01:11:30 has been
01:11:32 thoroughly trampling all my
01:11:34 attempts at
01:11:36 well, not trampling, but it's been cleaning
01:11:38 in my drawing time, which I'm 100% okay
01:11:40 with. As that MPC said
01:11:42 all my life is Pokemon, but for me
01:11:44 it's Minecraft. Which is
01:11:46 even more autistic.
01:11:48 Yeah, vastly
01:11:50 more so.
01:11:52 You don't even make shit in Minecraft.
01:11:54 You just say, you just disparage people
01:11:56 that make shit in Minecraft.
01:11:58 So wait, I'm sorry. We've been talking about this
01:12:00 this whole time and I'm confused.
01:12:02 What is it? What is it?
01:12:04 What's happening in Minecraft?
01:12:06 Is it nothing?
01:12:08 No, no.
01:12:10 With my lesions of fans that I have
01:12:12 we are constructing
01:12:14 a base
01:12:16 and once we
01:12:18 are all decked out
01:12:20 with the most least swaggiest of armor
01:12:22 we will enact our
01:12:24 global genocide of all new
01:12:26 fags. Well, I'm looking forward to that.
01:12:28 Yeah. Naturally.
01:12:30 Naturally.
01:12:38 Shit.
01:12:40 Yeah, dude.
01:12:42 Nice fucking
01:12:44 cheap-ass crit, stupid.
01:12:46 Yeah.
01:12:50 But it's too late.
01:12:52 I'm invincible. I can't be beat.
01:12:54 Oh, yeah.
01:12:56 Look at this kid over here thinking he's hot.
01:12:58 You know what they call me?
01:13:00 They call me that hunk of meat
01:13:02 that's tough to beat.
01:13:04 That's what the ladies say.
01:13:06 That's how that works?
01:13:08 What?
01:13:10 How what works?
01:13:12 I didn't know. I was all wrong.
01:13:14 Yeah, bro.
01:13:16 I was all wrong.
01:13:18 Look at this piece of shit I have.
01:13:20 A fucking shatot.
01:13:22 Ugh.
01:13:24 Uh, well,
01:13:26 I mean,
01:13:28 it's a good switch out, I guess.
01:13:30 Uh, actually,
01:13:32 no, he's gay. Yeah.
01:13:34 It's horrible.
01:13:36 Yeah, he's really dumb. He's really dumb and bad.
01:13:38 Uh, he's pitiful.
01:13:40 Blin-pop bitch.
01:13:42 I know. I know.
01:13:44 I'm fucked now.
01:13:46 Um, guess what?
01:13:48 Oh, no!
01:13:50 Hidden power. Oh, come on.
01:13:52 What was that? Ice? Oh, shit!
01:13:54 I'm not even good at this game, dude.
01:13:56 God, why do moves miss?
01:13:58 It's not fair. It's not right.
01:14:00 It's not fair.
01:14:02 It's not fair when things happen.
01:14:04 I'm bad at video games.
01:14:06 Yeah.
01:14:08 Right.
01:14:10 Was it probably hidden power fire?
01:14:12 No, it was...
01:14:14 It could have been hidden power fighting.
01:14:16 Was it hidden power fighting?
01:14:18 You know it, dude.
01:14:20 No, no.
01:14:22 You know it. That's exactly what it was.
01:14:24 Maybe it was hidden power normal.
01:14:26 Yeah, it's probably that.
01:14:28 Oh, of course it was. It was that as well.
01:14:30 I mean, what else would it have been, really,
01:14:32 when you get right down to it?
01:14:34 All right. All right, jelly man.
01:14:36 You're the greatest.
01:14:38 Yeah, there's nothing you can do
01:14:40 against all this jelly.
01:14:42 You know what I'm saying, dude?
01:14:44 You know what I'm saying, bro?
01:14:46 Maybe you've heard the...
01:14:48 No, hip-no!
01:14:50 Oh, god. He's at exactly 50.
01:14:52 What a piece of absolute shit.
01:15:00 Oh, no.
01:15:02 Yeah, bro.
01:15:04 Dude, you're paralyzed. You can't do anything.
01:15:06 You can't do anything.
01:15:08 You're weak.
01:15:10 You're weak, dude. Quiver dance?
01:15:12 Pathetic.
01:15:14 No, check this out.
01:15:16 Check this out, dude. Check this out, dude.
01:15:18 Yeah, dude.
01:15:20 Shit.
01:15:22 Yeah, bro.
01:15:24 Oh, I really...
01:15:26 I really came out ahead. You really screwed the pooch on that one.
01:15:28 You really screwed the pooch.
01:15:30 You definitely screwed the pooch.
01:15:32 Yeah, right.
01:15:34 Oh, chat-hot. Oh, nothing.
01:15:36 Nothing. Not a single thing.
01:15:40 Yeah, I have no...
01:15:42 Shit, that was your first guy.
01:15:44 I thought we were further along.
01:15:46 No.
01:15:48 No, not at all.
01:15:52 Uh, fuck.
01:15:58 This Jensen is gonna sweep me.
01:16:04 Maybe.
01:16:06 Probably.
01:16:20 What do I have here?
01:16:22 Not...
01:16:28 I'm God.
01:16:30 I just realized I'm God.
01:16:32 I hope the camera was on that what I just did,
01:16:34 because I'm fucking God.
01:16:36 What, that you just did that psycho shift?
01:16:38 Yeah.
01:16:40 That's just what you do with a sigilif.
01:16:42 Dude, you're just bad.
01:16:44 I really wish I should have taunted the turn before.
01:16:46 But you know what?
01:16:48 I didn't have a choice.
01:16:50 It's all good.
01:16:52 And now you're gonna die.
01:16:54 Fuck. God!
01:16:56 Christ, why didn't I see that coming?
01:16:58 Yeah.
01:17:00 Yeah, you fucking punk.
01:17:02 I really fucked that up.
01:17:04 You punk.
01:17:06 What am I doing here?
01:17:16 Oh no.
01:17:18 Oh dear.
01:17:20 Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
01:17:22 I think I'm worried about this meowstick.
01:17:24 I hope I don't have another...
01:17:26 fucking...
01:17:28 Who is the one?
01:17:30 Who did you fucking call mine
01:17:32 sweep me with the first time?
01:17:34 Alakazam.
01:17:36 Yeah, I hope you don't have another Alakazam
01:17:38 situation on our hands.
01:17:40 Why are you so stupid?
01:17:42 I don't know, man.
01:17:44 Why did you think that was a good idea?
01:17:46 Because I have many
01:17:48 abilities.
01:17:50 You should give me more credit.
01:17:52 You know...
01:17:54 Yeah, you're right.
01:17:56 Nah, dude.
01:17:58 But ironically, it was you
01:18:00 who was paralyzed.
01:18:02 It was in fact me.
01:18:04 It was me who was gay.
01:18:06 Yes, that is the great irony.
01:18:10 Come on, dude!
01:18:12 What the fuck? You didn't even know I had that!
01:18:14 The power predict
01:18:16 is real.
01:18:18 What the fuck?
01:18:20 The power predict is in fact realer than it has ever been.
01:18:22 Did you just use that
01:18:24 that I was going to switch to
01:18:26 and you were just like...
01:18:28 No, I knew.
01:18:30 I knew, dude.
01:18:32 I knew because
01:18:34 you thought it would be some good.
01:18:36 You know because I'm good.
01:18:38 You're not good, bro!
01:18:40 You're just
01:18:42 not okay!
01:18:44 You don't even
01:18:46 fucking know who's real
01:18:48 and who's not real.
01:18:50 That's true.
01:18:52 But...
01:19:02 Oh, no. Why did I do that?
01:19:04 Oh, no!
01:19:06 You're not even good, dude.
01:19:08 This collusion of play.
01:19:10 This collusion of play.
01:19:12 I can tell.
01:19:14 Yeah, the two U's are definitely colluding with each other
01:19:16 in both of these simultaneous
01:19:18 battles we got going on here.
01:19:22 They have mass info
01:19:24 that they will use.
01:19:26 What a fucking disaster this is.
01:19:30 That's what you get when you have
01:19:32 someone like Ben St.
01:19:34 aka Max Survive
01:19:36 Ben St. here.
01:19:38 Okay.
01:19:40 You're gonna be sorry
01:19:42 when I beat you up.
01:19:44 In real life.
01:19:46 That's right.
01:19:48 In real life, I'm going to do it.
01:19:50 Damn it!
01:19:52 Not even fucking good.
01:19:54 Not even good.
01:19:56 I think you may not be
01:19:58 as good
01:20:00 as you once believed.
01:20:02 You don't know that shit.
01:20:06 God, did we have anything else?
01:20:08 Was there any other talking points?
01:20:12 You were really gung-ho
01:20:14 about Sun and Moon.
01:20:16 You were like...
01:20:18 I want to hear about General
01:20:20 Pokemon Info.
01:20:22 You know what?
01:20:24 I'm not super hyped about the Pokemon
01:20:26 designs that have been leaked.
01:20:28 Really?
01:20:30 They're not terrible.
01:20:32 But, wait, wait.
01:20:34 There was one that I really liked.
01:20:36 God,
01:20:38 the bug that's called
01:20:40 Wimp-Out.
01:20:42 Yeah, Wimp-Out.
01:20:44 Yeah, that guy's really good.
01:20:46 Let's see.
01:20:50 I guess the Ghost Sandcastle
01:20:52 is kind of okay?
01:20:54 He's alright.
01:20:56 There's already an Earth Ghost,
01:20:58 so whatever.
01:21:00 Let's see.
01:21:02 What else stood out to me?
01:21:04 Well,
01:21:06 Incineroar is the worst Pokemon ever.
01:21:10 There's never been...
01:21:12 and there never will be anything as terrible.
01:21:14 I don't think I...
01:21:16 Okay, yeah, that was fine.
01:21:18 I feel that way about Alolan Persian.
01:21:20 I hate...
01:21:22 Alolan Persian might be as bad
01:21:24 as fucking the other thing.
01:21:26 It's so terrible.
01:21:28 It's amazing how terrible it is.
01:21:30 I honestly can't believe...
01:21:32 It was green lit.
01:21:34 You know what?
01:21:36 I actually think...
01:21:38 I think if I hadn't seen original Persian,
01:21:40 I wouldn't mind it.
01:21:42 Fucking no.
01:21:44 It looks goofy, but a lot of Pokemon look goofy.
01:21:46 It's just the fact that it looks so...
01:21:48 It's...
01:21:50 They just took regular Persian
01:21:52 and made it look stupid.
01:21:54 And I don't get it.
01:21:56 I don't get what they were going for.
01:21:58 I feel like they were trying to make it cuter,
01:22:00 but they just failed.
01:22:02 There's an in-depth Pokedex
01:22:04 on Pokemon.com
01:22:06 that states that it is a beautiful Pokemon in Alola.
01:22:08 And that is
01:22:10 worship towards beauty.
01:22:12 There's no fucking way that's true.
01:22:14 That's more true
01:22:16 than anyone could ever even imagine.
01:22:20 Oh, you have Wonder Guard?
01:22:22 Is that why you didn't take damage from that burn?
01:22:24 That's exactly why.
01:22:26 Wait...
01:22:32 I know it's not going to help me,
01:22:34 but...
01:22:36 Oh my god, are you stupid?
01:22:38 Well, you know...
01:22:42 Come on.
01:22:44 There we go.
01:22:46 I called because I figured you were going to switch.
01:22:48 No.
01:22:50 I would never do something like that.
01:22:52 I would never switch.
01:22:54 That's my policy, is never switch.
01:22:56 Yeah.
01:22:58 And it's got me this far.
01:23:00 And it's pretty cool.
01:23:02 No.
01:23:04 Don't do that.
01:23:06 No, there's nothing I can do.
01:23:08 Don't worry.
01:23:10 I know.
01:23:12 That's not pathetic.
01:23:14 What were you thinking?
01:23:24 What were you thinking?
01:23:26 What do you mean I healed myself?
01:23:30 Oh god, oh god.
01:23:32 What were you thinking?
01:23:34 God, dude, oh shit, bro.
01:23:36 Wow, Vincent's not even good at this game.
01:23:38 Wow.
01:23:40 I might not be good at this game,
01:23:42 but at least I'm the coolest guy in the world.
01:23:44 You know what I'm saying, dude?
01:23:46 Yeah, woo!
01:23:48 Alright.
01:23:50 How much fucking poison damage is Jellison going to take?
01:23:52 Holy shit.
01:23:54 Well, that's impressive.
01:23:58 Oh, I think I might lose this one, yeah.
01:24:00 Why'd you do that, dude?
01:24:02 Because that's the only thing I can do.
01:24:06 Nothing else could possibly have done anything.
01:24:08 Dude, you were faster than me.
01:24:10 But I only have things that are weak against you.
01:24:14 You don't have a fire move on Infernape?
01:24:16 No.
01:24:18 Weird.
01:24:20 That's wacky.
01:24:22 That's unfortunate.
01:24:24 It's unfortunate.
01:24:26 Truly unfortunate.
01:24:28 She said it doesn't even matter.
01:24:30 It's not even unfortunate.
01:24:32 I know. Nothing matters.
01:24:34 Nothing matters, dude.
01:24:36 Not even cool.
01:24:44 There's nothing.
01:24:46 There's nothing.
01:24:48 I know, dude.
01:24:50 There's nothing.
01:24:52 That one's a lost cause.
01:24:54 Oh, come on.
01:24:56 Let's see this shit.
01:24:58 That one's done.
01:25:00 That one's done.
01:25:02 A million times Bensane.
01:25:06 You're so gay.
01:25:08 It's over.
01:25:10 It's over with how gay you are right now.
01:25:12 It's so over.
01:25:14 Oh, you think so, do you?
01:25:16 Is that a fact, bro?
01:25:28 Ah, fuck.
01:25:32 I don't care about him.
01:25:34 It doesn't matter.
01:25:36 Dude, I've got this momentum.
01:25:38 Is that the momentum going?
01:25:40 I'm like using roll out.
01:25:42 But in a meta sort of way.
01:25:44 Oh, wait, fuck.
01:25:46 I forgot I'm paralyzed.
01:25:52 It doesn't matter though.
01:25:54 I know you've got...
01:25:56 Oh, come on.
01:25:58 Oh, I'm so gay.
01:26:00 That actually doesn't matter.
01:26:02 Yeah, actually, it's not enough.
01:26:04 Uh, hmm.
01:26:06 Shit.
01:26:36 Um...
01:26:38 Yeah, a little Impersion is the worst.
01:26:40 Yeah.
01:26:42 What do you think about Incineroar?
01:26:44 I'm not too upset these days.
01:26:46 I didn't want to pick Liden anyway.
01:26:48 What I'm...
01:26:50 I mean, aside from whether you're going to use it,
01:26:52 do you think it's good because I think it's horrible.
01:26:54 I think it's the worst Pokemon ever designed.
01:26:56 No, no.
01:26:58 I think it's fine.
01:27:00 It's not fine, dude.
01:27:02 It's not right.
01:27:04 It's not natural.
01:27:06 It goes against the ways of real life.
01:27:08 It does.
01:27:10 It goes against everything we were taught in school.
01:27:14 Boys kiss girls and girls kiss boys.
01:27:16 Not any of this.
01:27:18 Not whatever the other...
01:27:20 Not whatever the reverse of that is.
01:27:22 Yeah, exactly.
01:27:26 Why did I do that?
01:27:28 That was stupid.
01:27:30 Oh, fuck.
01:27:32 Oh, come on.
01:27:34 It doesn't matter. You're a special attacker, but it's still that damage.
01:27:38 Yeah, that damage...
01:27:40 That damage is going to get me. I really fucked up.
01:27:42 I really fucked up.
01:27:46 Oh, no, it's okay.
01:27:48 Yeah.
01:27:50 I think you could have got me if you'd scalded.
01:27:52 Yeah, but I thought you were going to switch.
01:28:02 Yeah.
01:28:14 Everything's fucking paralyzed.
01:28:20 Why are you constantly going in and out of...
01:28:22 like your CWC impression?
01:28:24 That wasn't a CWC.
01:28:26 It sounds like it.
01:28:28 Munchie, are you familiar with baby cakes?
01:28:30 Yes, of course.
01:28:32 Okay.
01:28:34 I think I've sent you a video of theirs before.
01:28:36 I forget what it was.
01:28:38 Wait a minute.
01:28:40 Who do you mean there? Are we thinking of the same baby cakes?
01:28:42 Are we thinking of...
01:28:44 I'm baby cakes.
01:28:46 You are baby cakes.
01:28:48 Yes, yes, yes.
01:28:50 I'm aware, but I say they as in...
01:28:52 I don't know. I'm gender neutral.
01:28:54 Yeah, you're the gender neutral pronoun.
01:28:56 Good. That's what I like to hear.
01:28:58 Fuck.
01:29:00 So...
01:29:02 I can't remember what the specific video was about.
01:29:06 Fuck me, dude.
01:29:08 But I remember that I quite enjoyed it
01:29:10 and I sent you and you were like,
01:29:12 oh, LOL, you like them too?
01:29:14 And I was like, okay.
01:29:16 Me and Digi have been...
01:29:20 We watched all of it recently
01:29:22 and we've just been quoting it all the time.
01:29:24 And...
01:29:26 I mean,
01:29:28 DeVoo has started to say that
01:29:30 all my voices
01:29:32 sound like the baby cakes.
01:29:34 All my fake voices sound like...
01:29:36 There's a meme or something where
01:29:38 all Jesse's voices sound the same.
01:29:40 A meme as in not just fact.
01:29:42 Right.
01:29:44 Right. But with my case
01:29:46 it actually is a meme because it's not true
01:29:48 that all my fake voices sound like baby cakes.
01:29:50 They don't. They're all unique and special.
01:29:52 Unique and special.
01:29:54 Yes.
01:29:56 God fucking Christ.
01:29:58 Christ.
01:30:00 Ah, God.
01:30:02 So bad.
01:30:04 So bad.
01:30:06 Doesn't matter.
01:30:08 Nothing matters.
01:30:10 This is...
01:30:12 I don't know what to do about this slow, bro.
01:30:14 I really don't.
01:30:16 You're just bad, dude. That's all there is to it.
01:30:18 I think I might just be bad.
01:30:20 You're so bad!
01:30:22 You need to do that.
01:30:26 Why don't you just fucking...
01:30:28 Oh no. Yes!
01:30:30 Yeah!
01:30:32 Just crit and then...
01:30:34 Oh, weak.
01:30:36 Kiram, just fucking get a crit, dude.
01:30:38 Just fucking get a crit right now
01:30:40 where I'll kill you.
01:30:46 Come on, dude. You've got one in 16 chance
01:30:48 and you can't do it.
01:30:50 Oh, no.
01:30:52 I'm out of PP.
01:30:54 Yeah, I'm bad.
01:30:56 It's an 8-PP move!
01:30:58 That's what I was waiting for. This is my opportunity.
01:31:00 That sucks so much.
01:31:02 What do I even do now?
01:31:06 Um...
01:31:10 Oh, now you've got a fucking crit!
01:31:12 You bastard!
01:31:14 Oh, shit.
01:31:16 Ah, you fucked up, dude.
01:31:18 You fucked up, man.
01:31:20 I fucked up by not factoring in the
01:31:22 random number generation.
01:31:24 You did.
01:31:26 Ah!
01:31:28 No!
01:31:30 So bad.
01:31:34 Damn it.
01:31:36 Yes! Oh, no! Oh, well, okay.
01:31:38 All right, all right.
01:31:40 Um...
01:31:42 Yeah.
01:31:44 Yeah, I got it.
01:31:46 I got it.
01:31:48 Damn it.
01:31:50 He does have this.
01:31:52 Yes.
01:31:54 Damn it, it's over!
01:31:56 Yeah, that's it.
01:31:58 I can't believe this.
01:32:00 I can't believe this.
01:32:02 Okay, this is good.
01:32:04 This is going good so far.
01:32:06 I hate you.
01:32:08 I've really managed to turn it all around
01:32:10 on myself.
01:32:12 And prove that I am the greatest
01:32:14 all the time.
01:32:16 It's not even fucking...
01:32:18 It's not even real.
01:32:20 Okay, okay.
01:32:22 God, I don't know.
01:32:24 You want to do one more?
01:32:26 Yeah, yeah, we'll do one more.
01:32:28 Okay.
01:32:30 God, that news post
01:32:32 that says, oh, Election Days,
01:32:34 you're like so aggravating.
01:32:36 It's a Pokemon battling simulator.
01:32:38 We don't care.
01:32:40 Or whether you think Trump will make America great again.
01:32:42 Come and have a fucking chat
01:32:44 in our stupid chat room.
01:32:46 Fuck.
01:32:48 I don't, if that's the attitude
01:32:50 you're going to bring to it, sir.
01:32:52 Sir, good sir.
01:32:54 I'm sorry, but you're done this time.
01:32:56 No.
01:32:58 I can see.
01:33:00 I can see my future and it looks bright.
01:33:02 It's bright.
01:33:04 I can see your future.
01:33:06 It's reflected in your eyes' mind.
01:33:08 Who's faster?
01:33:10 Probably...
01:33:12 Oh, dear.
01:33:14 Okay.
01:33:16 Oh, dear.
01:33:18 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
01:33:20 Oh, no. Oh, boy.
01:33:22 Fuck.
01:33:24 Uh...
01:33:26 Um...
01:33:28 Um...
01:33:30 Um...
01:33:32 Um...
01:33:34 Um...
01:33:36 Um...
01:33:38 You know...
01:33:40 What? Yeah, what do I mean?
01:33:42 You know what I mean, dude?
01:33:44 I can't...
01:33:46 Yeah, you know what I'm fucking talking about.
01:33:48 I can't penetrate that thick skull of yours
01:33:50 and get the juicy information
01:33:52 on what you were putting down.
01:33:54 Uh...
01:33:56 Um...
01:33:58 I can't even imagine
01:34:00 what disgusting, filthy place
01:34:02 is you are operating in.
01:34:04 Munchie, can you see what item
01:34:06 my Nitto Queen has?
01:34:08 Uh, no.
01:34:10 Not yet.
01:34:12 Huh. Okay.
01:34:14 Weird.
01:34:16 Uh...
01:34:18 I don't know.
01:34:20 I don't know.
01:34:22 I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
01:34:24 Oh, boo.
01:34:26 Boo!
01:34:28 Cheating.
01:34:30 Collusion.
01:34:32 I don't... I don't care if it goes...
01:34:34 Oh, boo!
01:34:36 Oh, you idiot.
01:34:38 Oh, you fucked it up, bro.
01:34:40 Oh, you fucked it up, bro.
01:34:42 Oh, you fucked it up, bro.
01:34:44 That...
01:34:46 That feel when toxic misses.
01:34:48 That feel when toxic misses.
01:34:50 That feel when toxic misses.
01:34:52 Oh, there's nothing.
01:34:54 There's nothing that could have
01:34:56 feel me with more and more
01:34:58 fucking rage than what just
01:35:00 right now.
01:35:02 Agreed. Agreed.
01:35:04 Hmm...
01:35:06 Well, this guy's...
01:35:08 I'm not gonna knock off on this guy
01:35:10 because he's definitely got
01:35:12 what you call it...
01:35:14 He's definitely a mega, mega
01:35:16 Evolver.
01:35:18 No, you don't know that.
01:35:20 I'm sure about it, dude. No.
01:35:22 I'm so sure.
01:35:24 Uh...
01:35:26 Oh, man. This guy doesn't have...
01:35:28 This guy's weak to flying ghost
01:35:30 and fairy.
01:35:32 That's not very much.
01:35:34 Yeah. You know why it's not very much?
01:35:36 Because he's trained in the Tiberian
01:35:38 mountains, and he's made sure
01:35:40 that everyone is lower than him.
01:35:42 Wow.
01:35:44 Because he's researched various virtues
01:35:46 that allows him to evolve past.
01:35:48 Which virtues is it that lets
01:35:50 a Gallade mega-evolve?
01:35:52 Uh, probably
01:35:54 Justice and Chastity.
01:35:56 Justice and Chastity?
01:35:58 Yeah, he looks pretty chased over there.
01:36:00 He looks like an anime protagonist.
01:36:02 He does.
01:36:04 Uh...
01:36:06 I should let me check with my list of virtues
01:36:08 that I have.
01:36:10 Can you read some of them off for us?
01:36:12 Yes, yes. Of course, of course.
01:36:14 Thank God. Okay.
01:36:18 Ah, man.
01:36:22 I don't know, man.
01:36:24 I don't know.
01:36:26 Alright.
01:36:28 That's probably a terrible idea.
01:36:30 These are the virtues.
01:36:32 Chastity, temperance,
01:36:34 charity, diligence, patience,
01:36:36 kindness, and humility.
01:36:38 So, I forgot.
01:36:40 I merged Courage and Justice
01:36:42 into one.
01:36:46 Hmm.
01:36:48 So...
01:36:50 Okay. Say you had two Alligators.
01:36:52 Fuck, man!
01:36:54 Did you see that shit? Yeah, I saw it.
01:36:56 Sleep powder fails yet again?
01:36:58 I saw it.
01:37:00 Don't worry.
01:37:02 There's nothing I don't see.
01:37:06 Are you fucking kidding me?
01:37:08 You're so bad.
01:37:10 I honestly can't believe
01:37:12 how bad you are.
01:37:14 That's wrong.
01:37:16 And it's a sin, frankly.
01:37:18 Honestly, it's disgusting.
01:37:20 I think it's the devil's work.
01:37:22 Here's what I want to know.
01:37:24 Say you have two...
01:37:26 Oh, God.
01:37:28 What's a good... What was the word you used
01:37:30 for reptiles and...
01:37:32 Herptophonus.
01:37:34 Okay, say you've got two Herptophonus.
01:37:36 Say you've got a...
01:37:38 Oh, God.
01:37:40 Two annals, right?
01:37:42 You've got two beautiful annals.
01:37:44 And they're just like...
01:37:46 And one of them learns
01:37:48 temperance.
01:37:50 And the other learns...
01:37:58 Wait. Patience.
01:38:00 Yeah, patience, sure.
01:38:02 One of them learns temperance.
01:38:04 I mean, those are very similar virtues, but whatever.
01:38:06 One of them learns temperance and one of them learns patience.
01:38:08 Like, do they become
01:38:10 different things? Yes.
01:38:12 Okay, okay.
01:38:14 But if two different annals each learned,
01:38:16 what kind of courage would they become
01:38:18 the same thing, basically? No, no, no.
01:38:20 It depends on both your virtue
01:38:22 and your species.
01:38:24 I know, but I'm saying, like, if two things
01:38:26 of the same species learned the same virtue,
01:38:28 would they become a similar thing?
01:38:30 Well, it's also...
01:38:32 It's like your God tier, so they can't be
01:38:34 two of the same.
01:38:36 They'll be similar, but not completely
01:38:38 different things. Okay, yes.
01:38:40 So there's individual variation there, okay.
01:38:42 Yes.
01:38:44 Yeah, gotcha.
01:38:46 What, is Technoblast
01:38:48 normal type?
01:38:50 Yeah.
01:38:52 No, no, no, it's bug, it's bug.
01:38:54 Wait, really? Are you
01:38:56 futzing with me? I'm not futzing with you.
01:38:58 Are you trickering me?
01:39:00 Are you trying
01:39:02 to trick me yet again, Goofy?
01:39:04 Or Donald?
01:39:06 Is that
01:39:08 a line? Yes.
01:39:10 That is, in fact, a line. Shit.
01:39:12 Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
01:39:14 See, now I've got you on the ropes, I think.
01:39:16 Oh, come on! Oh, yeah!
01:39:18 Yeah! I didn't even realize
01:39:20 I had that! How the fuck
01:39:22 is that a thing you can learn? I don't know.
01:39:24 It must be a hidden ability or something.
01:39:26 That's so fucked up, how? It's a fish.
01:39:28 Wait, but he's got a horn, he's got a
01:39:30 lightning rod. That means nothing.
01:39:32 And you know when you attract lightning,
01:39:34 then it's good for you.
01:39:36 I can't
01:39:38 fucking believe that just happened.
01:39:40 That's the worst thing that any...
01:39:42 That's the
01:39:44 real tragedy that happened today.
01:39:46 Well, there's definitely been
01:39:48 some tragedy, I don't know what.
01:39:50 Something
01:39:52 we won't speak of.
01:39:54 Yeah.
01:39:56 You're talking about
01:39:58 how Bernie Sanders assassinated
01:40:00 President Obama. For reasons
01:40:02 that he refuses to
01:40:04 divulge.
01:40:06 To acknowledge and or
01:40:08 even slightly
01:40:10 collaborate upon.
01:40:12 You know what, dude?
01:40:14 You're so stupid. No, you're so...
01:40:16 Oh, what the f...
01:40:18 God!
01:40:20 God fuck!
01:40:22 No!
01:40:24 Let me explain everything that I fucked up.
01:40:26 Ladies and gentlemen,
01:40:28 BeenSaintOfFiction.com has died today.
01:40:30 I fucked up so deeply
01:40:32 this battle.
01:40:34 Like, I was so sure
01:40:36 that Gallade was the mega-evolver, right?
01:40:38 And I...
01:40:40 I looked at... Yeah, I looked...
01:40:42 Cause I was like, oh...
01:40:44 Oh man, I thought because
01:40:46 Absol had been out before and didn't mega-evolve,
01:40:48 then it must not be it.
01:40:50 And then I compared speeds
01:40:52 and I'm like, oh,
01:40:54 Seeking's one speed faster than Absol.
01:40:56 That means I can mega-horn it before
01:40:58 it's 1.5 times attack
01:41:00 from justified has a chance to fuck me up.
01:41:02 Yeah, okay.
01:41:04 Absolutely wrong.
01:41:06 Doesn't matter.
01:41:08 Doesn't matter.
01:41:10 We're just gonna
01:41:12 carry on.
01:41:16 We're gonna continue.
01:41:18 We're gonna push...
01:41:20 We're gonna push for
01:41:22 broad social change.
01:41:24 Yeah!
01:41:26 Come on, man.
01:41:28 He's so bad, ladies and gentlemen.
01:41:30 He can't do anything right.
01:41:32 I was...
01:41:34 There's just nothing he can do that will
01:41:36 make anyone like him. There's just nothing.
01:41:38 I mean...
01:41:40 I thought you were gonna sucker punch
01:41:42 so I bulked up.
01:41:44 It didn't work.
01:41:46 You know what?
01:41:48 I'm not that far behind.
01:41:50 Oh, yeah, sure.
01:41:54 Oh, how foolish.
01:41:56 I'm gonna do this.
01:41:58 Oh, how foolish.
01:42:00 It's so aesthetic.
01:42:02 Okay.
01:42:04 Oh, how foolish.
01:42:06 Okay, that wasn't great.
01:42:08 Oh, how terrible.
01:42:10 What?
01:42:12 Oh, come on!
01:42:14 Oh, no!
01:42:16 No!
01:42:18 God, if I...
01:42:20 I didn't...
01:42:22 I would've killed you with a body slam
01:42:24 but I thought you were gonna...
01:42:26 I thought you were gonna sucker punch
01:42:28 I can't...
01:42:30 I can't overstate
01:42:32 how filthy
01:42:34 he is in every way.
01:42:36 That was the worst thing I've ever done.
01:42:40 Okay, no, whatever, though.
01:42:42 I'm hard depressed to think of a time
01:42:44 that Ben has ever showered before in his life.
01:42:46 Has ever what?
01:42:48 Showered before.
01:42:50 That's true. That's true.
01:42:52 No, man.
01:42:54 Let me tell you about hygiene.
01:42:56 I engage in it.
01:42:58 More than you could ever know.
01:43:00 More than you could...
01:43:02 more than you could imagine.
01:43:08 Carnivine's going...
01:43:10 Okay, honestly, I don't think I've ever had
01:43:12 a carnivine on my team and not been disappointed
01:43:14 in its performance.
01:43:16 Yeah, carnivine sucks.
01:43:18 Carnivine, in my experience, carnivine has sucked
01:43:20 really hard.
01:43:22 But not this time.
01:43:24 Oh, shit.
01:43:26 This time, things are gonna be different.
01:43:28 Uh, yes.
01:43:32 Good.
01:43:34 Good.
01:43:36 Yeah.
01:43:40 Yeah, bro.
01:43:42 What the fuck?
01:43:44 You're so bad.
01:43:46 Wait.
01:43:48 Oh, no.
01:43:50 Oh, no.
01:43:52 Was that quadruped?
01:43:54 Was that doubly ineffective?
01:43:56 No, it was just singly ineffective.
01:43:58 Mm-hmm.
01:44:00 Okay, well, that's terrible.
01:44:02 Terrible.
01:44:04 That's just awful.
01:44:06 If I don't wake up, you might have a chance.
01:44:08 No, okay.
01:44:10 Yeah.
01:44:12 Yeah.
01:44:14 I have made
01:44:16 every possible mistake.
01:44:18 Oh, my God.
01:44:20 It's a good guy.
01:44:22 Yeah, yeah.
01:44:24 It's over now, stupid.
01:44:26 It's over now, stupid.
01:44:28 That's over now.
01:44:30 Oh, no.
01:44:32 Oh, let's see.
01:44:34 I got it now.
01:44:36 You aren't really demonstrating
01:44:38 the virtue of kindness there, Ben.
01:44:40 You might...
01:44:42 I'll make a specific exception for stupid people
01:44:44 to de-grass on the evolutionary chart.
01:44:46 Just for you.
01:44:48 Thank you.
01:44:50 Thanks, sir.
01:44:52 Oh, good.
01:44:54 Oh, good, I did it.
01:44:56 What am I going to de-grass into?
01:44:58 A zekrom?
01:45:00 A tadpole.
01:45:02 A tadpole.
01:45:04 Uh, well, you know...
01:45:08 I don't think you've...
01:45:10 I don't think you even...
01:45:12 I don't think you've got anything.
01:45:14 Oh, wait, you got Shadow Sneak.
01:45:16 Oh, shit.
01:45:18 I have more options
01:45:20 that you could ever even imagine.
01:45:22 Oh, this is...
01:45:24 Yeah, okay.
01:45:32 Oh, dear.
01:45:34 Okay.
01:45:36 That's fine.
01:45:38 That's good, in fact.
01:45:44 Boo!
01:45:46 Boo!
01:45:48 That's good, in fact, is it?
01:45:50 And that's good, in fact.
01:45:52 That's actually good.
01:45:54 That's actually what I wanted.
01:45:56 I wanted you to win.
01:45:58 This has all been a trap.
01:46:00 It's all been one trap.
01:46:02 You've taken me home.
01:46:04 You've...
01:46:06 You've wooed me at the bar.
01:46:08 You've successfully seduced me.
01:46:10 You've taken me back to...
01:46:12 Now, sex home.
01:46:14 And now you've realized
01:46:16 the unfortunate truth.
01:46:18 The truly, the truly
01:46:20 savage truth.
01:46:22 That you are, in fact, stupid and terrible.
01:46:24 Munchy?
01:46:26 Munchy, I invited you here to play Pokemon Stay
01:46:28 for a very specific reason.
01:46:30 I want you to look around and realize
01:46:32 that your house is now on fire.
01:46:34 Oh, no!
01:46:36 I knew it.
01:46:38 Okay, I didn't get so blind.
01:46:40 I knew it would work.
01:46:42 I knew there was no way to stop.
01:46:44 I can't believe this!
01:46:46 You want to do one more?
01:46:48 Yeah, well, yeah, sure, sure.
01:46:50 If you want to be completely humiliated again, sure.
01:46:52 I feel like I didn't put my best foot forward that time.
01:46:54 I feel like you have no feet.
01:46:56 And you were a wheelchair-bound,
01:46:58 disgusting Chinese man.
01:47:00 Sure, sure.
01:47:02 But, um...
01:47:04 I mean, what of it?
01:47:06 Oh, you're foolish.
01:47:08 Oh, but actually not that foolish.
01:47:10 Aw, damn.
01:47:12 Okay.
01:47:14 Uh, hmm.
01:47:16 Options.
01:47:18 Options, options, options.
01:47:20 Uh, no.
01:47:22 Oh, he's going to call in his
01:47:24 dirty corporate friends
01:47:26 to collude and destroy
01:47:28 the server so I can't
01:47:30 participate in a fair state.
01:47:32 Yeah, dude, we're going to collude, man.
01:47:34 We're really going to collude really hard.
01:47:36 He's going to call up his
01:47:38 gang, affectionately called the Max Survives.
01:47:40 And, uh...
01:47:42 Yeah, that's right.
01:47:44 Yeah, that's about it.
01:47:46 That's about the size of it, I think.
01:47:50 I'm waiting for
01:47:52 Vincent.
01:47:54 Vincent.
01:47:56 Vincent. Hey!
01:47:58 Hey!
01:48:00 Did you ever see
01:48:02 that one drawing I made on stream
01:48:04 of you where you were beating a woman
01:48:06 and you had an MRA card and Vincent was
01:48:08 puppeteering you?
01:48:10 I had what?
01:48:12 An MRA card? Yeah.
01:48:14 No, I don't think...
01:48:16 Yeah! Aw, critical hit!
01:48:18 Just when I needed it.
01:48:20 What the hell are you talking about?
01:48:22 No, I did not see that
01:48:24 drawing. Are you in a game right now?
01:48:26 No.
01:48:28 What? Am I not fighting you?
01:48:30 I'm fighting some Brando.
01:48:32 Yes, you are!
01:48:34 Oh, God.
01:48:36 What a buffoon.
01:48:38 What an absolute buffoon.
01:48:40 I can't believe it.
01:48:42 I just had the most incredible critical hit.
01:48:44 My
01:48:46 whiskash.
01:48:48 My whiskash just pulled off an incredible underdog
01:48:50 victory against a Rotom F
01:48:52 or the wind one.
01:48:54 Oh, the wind one sucks.
01:48:56 Yeah, well...
01:48:58 So what?
01:49:00 So what? What does that mean
01:49:02 in the grand scheme of things?
01:49:04 But I was very proud of that image
01:49:06 for the fact that there was political commentary
01:49:08 on sometimes the
01:49:10 lie between Ben and Vincent is so blared
01:49:12 that it's not even...
01:49:14 you can't even feasibly
01:49:16 recognize who's who.
01:49:18 That's true, man.
01:49:20 That's true.
01:49:22 That's truer than you even know.
01:49:24 Do I know
01:49:26 if I send you another invite
01:49:28 or no? Hang on.
01:49:30 I want to beat Internet
01:49:32 9.9.
01:49:34 I think I can do it.
01:49:36 Fucking Internet
01:49:38 9.99. We're ruining the
01:49:40 ratty fucking stuff.
01:49:42 Say
01:49:44 you're on YouTube. Say hello
01:49:46 in chat.
01:49:48 Oh, God. Okay, I will.
01:49:50 You're on YouTube.
01:49:52 Say hello.
01:49:54 Oh, God.
01:49:56 I feel dirty. I feel dirty
01:49:58 for what I've just done here today.
01:50:00 Well, we'll do as you know that.
01:50:02 He's gonna be Internet famous.
01:50:04 I want fan art of Internet of whatever his name is.
01:50:06 Oh, but I just fucking wrecked
01:50:08 his vanillax because he's a little bitch.
01:50:10 Oh, shit.
01:50:12 Oh, I feel so awful
01:50:14 for what I've said to him.
01:50:16 That seems...
01:50:18 That just seems like a bad wrong thing
01:50:20 to do. That doesn't seem like
01:50:22 the right way to behave in modern society.
01:50:24 It seems
01:50:26 so cruel.
01:50:28 It's so gauche.
01:50:30 How can you be so
01:50:32 without fucking compassion
01:50:34 for your fellow human beings
01:50:36 as to say that someone is on YouTube
01:50:38 and also to prompt them to say hello?
01:50:40 It's difficult. It's difficult to be as bad
01:50:42 as I am. It requires
01:50:44 an active...
01:50:46 It requires actively pushing down
01:50:48 my instincts towards
01:50:50 human decency and all the virtues
01:50:52 that I hold so dear.
01:50:54 Yes.
01:50:56 Kindness, generosity,
01:50:58 laughter, honesty.
01:51:00 What are some other ones maybe?
01:51:02 Generosity, loyalty.
01:51:04 Loyalty. That's the one.
01:51:06 And magic.
01:51:08 And magic, of course.
01:51:10 And magic, of course.
01:51:12 Like, naturally.
01:51:14 Show us how to see when AST is in
01:51:16 8 right now, right?
01:51:20 7? I want to say 7.
01:51:22 Whatever. Did you watch the last season?
01:51:24 Oh, god! He just...
01:51:26 Internet999 just responded in fucking Russian.
01:51:28 No!
01:51:30 What a hero!
01:51:32 He says...
01:51:34 He says...
01:51:36 Backwards are...
01:51:38 ...
01:51:40 ...
01:51:42 ...
01:51:44 You gotta Google translate right fucking now
01:51:46 and find out what he said.
01:51:48 You know what? That's the best idea I've ever heard.
01:51:50 laughter
01:51:52 Oh, he killed my jinx with his patcherisu.
01:51:58 Ben Strate has traveled across the world
01:52:00 through many, many, many
01:52:02 flights and travels and he has
01:52:04 mastered all of the
01:52:06 the virtues.
01:52:08 The languages? Oh, yeah.
01:52:10 That as well. But he has mastered all the virtues
01:52:12 and it's worth listening to it to a higher plane.
01:52:18 It's worth listening to it to a higher plane.
01:52:20 We un-evolved
01:52:22 cannot even comprehend.
01:52:24 No. And I mean, why would you even want to?
01:52:26 Even if you could comprehend it,
01:52:28 it's not like you could do anything with it, you fucking asshole.
01:52:30 laughter
01:52:32 Hey, guess what he said?
01:52:34 What?
01:52:36 I am Russian. Hi.
01:52:38 laughter
01:52:40 laughter
01:52:42 laughter
01:52:44 Oh.
01:52:46 Oh, he said something else, but I gotta
01:52:48 fucking...
01:52:50 I gotta do something about this.
01:52:52 I've got to do something about this.
01:52:54 I have to do something.
01:52:56 I'm gonna kill his cell with my bannet.
01:52:58 Better.
01:53:00 Easiest win.
01:53:02 Actually, I'm gonna taunt because that seems like the right thing to do.
01:53:06 Okay. I am Russian.
01:53:08 Okay. And then he follows up with...
01:53:12 Send a link.
01:53:14 laughter
01:53:16 As in a...
01:53:18 As in a link to the YouTube.
01:53:20 Yeah.
01:53:22 Do it.
01:53:24 But it doesn't exist yet.
01:53:26 No, you have to.
01:53:28 I'll just, I'll just, I'll link him to the procrastinators.
01:53:30 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:53:32 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:53:34 That's gonna be so fucking weird.
01:53:36 Dude, that's gonna be so fucking weird.
01:53:38 Dude, if you're, if you're, what's his name?
01:53:40 Internetfan?
01:53:42 His name is...
01:53:44 Internet99.1.
01:53:46 Internet99.1.
01:53:48 If you are watching this right now,
01:53:50 I want you to comment, press...
01:53:52 No, no, I want you to comment.
01:53:54 Just press one in your keyboard a lot of times.
01:54:00 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:54:02 Internet99.1.
01:54:04 If you're watching this, please, please let us know.
01:54:06 Yeah.
01:54:08 I need to feel, I need to feel that I'm, that I matter.
01:54:12 This is the only way to do that.
01:54:14 This is it. This is it.
01:54:16 It's the, it's the only possible way.
01:54:18 I'm, I'm just gonna link him to the fucking
01:54:20 channel and, uh,
01:54:22 you know,
01:54:24 whatever.
01:54:26 I wonder if he even, like, speaks English,
01:54:28 because, because he just, I mean...
01:54:30 Well, he probably, I think he Google trans,
01:54:32 I think he probably Google translated my message
01:54:34 because it took him a while to respond.
01:54:36 Yeah.
01:54:38 He's gonna learn English.
01:54:40 Just to watch the podcast.
01:54:44 Oh, jeez Louise.
01:54:46 He watch, he watches the podcast and it changes
01:54:48 his fucking life.
01:54:52 Ah, shit.
01:54:54 I let him kill my bannet because I'm stupid.
01:54:56 Just by happenstance,
01:54:58 what do you think would be the worst podcast
01:55:00 to, to enter on?
01:55:02 He, he, he opens up the memes
01:55:04 that needs to die podcast
01:55:06 and his life is forever changed.
01:55:08 I don't, I don't know.
01:55:10 I mean, my least favorite one
01:55:12 is everyone else's favorite one,
01:55:14 which is, um, uh, things we can't get into.
01:55:16 That's the yellow one, right?
01:55:18 I think so.
01:55:20 Yeah, I hate that one.
01:55:22 Yeah, that one sucks.
01:55:24 It's the, it's so bad.
01:55:26 It makes me so angry just thinking about it.
01:55:28 This guy is so fucked.
01:55:30 I've got,
01:55:32 I've got a goddamn
01:55:34 mega Kangaskhan.
01:55:36 It's all over the world.
01:55:38 That, that, that shit's broken.
01:55:40 Oh shit, but I used sucker punch.
01:55:42 And then he used toxic.
01:55:44 Ben, Ben, even when he has
01:55:46 an unbelievable advantage,
01:55:48 he just can't seem to close out.
01:55:50 I fucked it up.
01:55:52 And I, uh,
01:55:54 God, I'm so bad.
01:55:56 I've really screwed the pooch.
01:55:58 I couldn't beat his patcherisi with my mega Kangaskhan.
01:56:00 Oh my fucking god.
01:56:02 Oh, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
01:56:04 My second sucker punch worked.
01:56:06 Um, yes.
01:56:08 All right, let's see. He's on his last,
01:56:10 he's on his last poke and I've got three.
01:56:12 He's a druddigon. Uh, yeah, whatever.
01:56:14 Stupid.
01:56:16 Stupid.
01:56:18 What do I want to do? What do I want to do?
01:56:20 Uh, probably return, double return.
01:56:22 Oh, but he's sucker punched me.
01:56:24 Oh, you suck that.
01:56:26 How ironic.
01:56:28 So ironic.
01:56:30 It's, it's, it's more ironic
01:56:32 than I could ever even imagine.
01:56:34 True. True.
01:56:36 Uh...
01:56:42 Oh God.
01:56:46 I, I, I, I, I, I, all I've been doing
01:56:50 has, I've just been in the,
01:56:52 in these late hours of the night,
01:56:54 uh, I've, I've been checking
01:56:56 the, the MSP and Ventures
01:56:58 Snapchat to see
01:57:00 what, what beautiful post,
01:57:02 post-canon content Andrew Hussie
01:57:04 has sprinkled out for us.
01:57:06 Uh, that hasn't been any today, but I, but I check
01:57:08 back every night because there's been one for Halloween.
01:57:10 So there's, it's not just for important dates now.
01:57:12 It's just, it's just going to be
01:57:14 a slice of life
01:57:16 comic, Homestuck version 2.0
01:57:18 based entirely in Snapchat
01:57:20 and I'm ready for it.
01:57:22 Um, wait, has he actually been
01:57:24 posting anything? Yes.
01:57:26 There? Yes. Oh, shit. I mean, I don't use
01:57:28 Snapchat, so I wouldn't know. Well, neither do I
01:57:30 other than for this. Yeah, yeah.
01:57:32 But the, um, I mean, I have
01:57:34 Snapchat, so maybe I should fucking look.
01:57:36 Uh, okay, dude.
01:57:38 I'm in a fucking pickle right now.
01:57:40 He's on his last Pok√©mon,
01:57:42 but he just killed my second lesson.
01:57:44 Now it's his druddigon, who's in the middle.
01:57:46 He just used an outrage. He used an outrage
01:57:48 to kill my Latios.
01:57:50 So now he's got his outrage and druddigon, but all
01:57:52 I've got is my fucking credilly.
01:57:54 What the fuck is it?
01:57:56 Oh, oh, that's an amazing installer.
01:57:58 He's, he's not,
01:58:00 he's not.
01:58:02 I mean, I've got Gigadrain.
01:58:04 Alright, I guess I'm just going to recover
01:58:06 and hope that I don't die this turn.
01:58:08 And then once he's... What are your moves?
01:58:10 Rockslide, Stealth Rock, Gigadrain,
01:58:12 Recover. Oh, that shit.
01:58:14 Yeah, it's not good.
01:58:16 I mean, I could try to Rockslide him.
01:58:20 Um...
01:58:24 Eh.
01:58:26 I'm, I'm going to recover.
01:58:28 No, I'm going to, I'm going to Rockslide.
01:58:30 Oh fuck, oh god.
01:58:32 Oh, yeah, it does 51.
01:58:34 Oh, but he's confused.
01:58:36 Okay, he lost 30.
01:58:38 Okay, if he, if he hurts himself and
01:58:40 if he hurts himself and confusion this turn,
01:58:42 I win. If he doesn't, I lose. It's simple as that.
01:58:45 Let's see, place your bets, folks.
01:58:47 Press one for Munchie, 1-1-1-1-1.
01:58:49 Come on, Dreadigon, you piece of shit.
01:58:51 You're the worst Pokemon, you look like a Digimon
01:58:53 and nobody likes you.
01:58:55 I like him, he's just...
01:58:56 I don't mind him too, but everyone, like everyone
01:58:58 that I've, I don't know, like,
01:59:00 Digi and one other person have lately
01:59:02 have told me that they hate Dreadigon and I'm like,
01:59:04 he's not that bad.
01:59:05 The fact that you take Digi's opinion
01:59:07 seriously on any matter
01:59:09 just proves your...
01:59:11 I know, but like, I've been surprised.
01:59:13 I've just been hearing a lot of... Oh, he's...
01:59:15 What the fuck, he sucker punched me. What a fucking idiot.
01:59:20 He, he sucker punched me.
01:59:23 I thought he was gonna outrage again.
01:59:25 I don't know why he didn't. It was his only hope.
01:59:28 Okay, well, now I think I win.
01:59:31 Oh no, he did, no, he outraged again
01:59:33 and it killed me.
01:59:35 So bad.
01:59:37 So bad.
01:59:40 I'm gonna say to him, well,
01:59:44 well played.
01:59:45 He said Gigi, I say Gigi.
01:59:47 Everyone's, everyone's good.
01:59:49 All right, fuck you internet, 999.
01:59:51 I gotta get back to my real, my real best friend, Munchy.
01:59:55 You were in fact a fake best friend.
01:59:57 Yeah, you're just a fucking B-barrel.
01:59:59 Good job, idiot.
02:00:01 I'm really sorry.
02:00:03 I'm really, I'm really sorry to disrespect you like this.
02:00:06 By bringing a, you never,
02:00:08 never bring a B-barrel to a Yan mega fight,
02:00:10 know what I'm saying?
02:00:11 Whatever I hear the words been saying,
02:00:13 I automatically think of a B-barrel in my head, so.
02:00:15 Yeah, it's, it's disgusting.
02:00:17 It's, it's pathetic.
02:00:21 I don't know what to do here.
02:00:23 All right, let's have, no,
02:00:25 that was wrong.
02:00:27 I did the wrong thing.
02:00:29 Okay.
02:00:31 Wait, what the fuck?
02:00:33 What, I cursed.
02:00:35 But times two, does it always do that?
02:00:37 I don't think it's, it's cause I'm simple.
02:00:39 I have, I have simple, that's why.
02:00:41 Right, that's what, that's what simple does.
02:00:43 It doubles the status.
02:00:45 Yeah, okay.
02:00:47 But it doesn't matter.
02:00:49 Literally doesn't matter.
02:00:51 Or doesn't it?
02:00:53 No, it doesn't, okay.
02:00:55 Well, good.
02:00:57 That was great.
02:01:01 You went on a blaze of glory.
02:01:03 Just like a certain, just like a certain other normal type.
02:01:05 A certain other, yeah,
02:01:07 certain other, just pitiful,
02:01:09 disgusting, worthless, normal type.
02:01:11 I could mention, but I won't.
02:01:13 Because he's not worth the price.
02:01:15 He's not worth it.
02:01:19 Oh god.
02:01:21 What, what a fucking,
02:01:23 what a joke.
02:01:25 What a fucking, yeah.
02:01:27 What a fucking gem of a joke, you know.
02:01:29 Unlike the MPV of the series,
02:01:31 Munchy the Volpix.
02:01:33 Munchy the Volpix is a true hero
02:01:35 to all of us.
02:01:37 Nobody will, nobody can deny that.
02:01:39 Yeah, no one.
02:01:41 Not one of us.
02:01:43 Okay, okay.
02:01:45 Why the fuck?
02:01:47 Nice Uber.
02:01:49 Yeah, you're welcome.
02:01:51 Why the fuck does, um,
02:01:55 uh, you know, the red one
02:01:57 get a new type when it goes Uber
02:01:59 and Kyo-Gre doesn't?
02:02:01 Um, cause people like Red on Barry
02:02:03 cause he's better.
02:02:05 Um,
02:02:07 so,
02:02:09 it's just weird. Why doesn't he become
02:02:11 water-flying, or
02:02:13 something?
02:02:15 Uh, I think you'll have to
02:02:17 ask God for that.
02:02:19 I don't want to talk to him.
02:02:21 We're not cool right now.
02:02:23 We're not cool right now.
02:02:25 We got into a fight.
02:02:27 Oh shit.
02:02:29 Not a nice crit, dude.
02:02:31 Thanks. It was great.
02:02:33 Actually, I really enjoyed it.
02:02:35 Looking forward to the next one.
02:02:39 Yo, check this out. You're fucked.
02:02:41 Oh, what the fuck are you thinking?
02:02:43 Yeah, not even cool.
02:02:45 Yeah, it's pretty cool though.
02:02:47 Frankly.
02:02:49 What are you gonna do?
02:02:51 You're probably gonna do stone.
02:02:53 No, I would never do such a thing.
02:02:55 You're probably gonna do stone.
02:02:57 I would never do such a thing.
02:02:59 I would never soup to your level, Ben.
02:03:01 My-
02:03:03 My gut tells me
02:03:05 that a stone edge
02:03:07 or a rock slide is coming.
02:03:09 This is imminent.
02:03:11 Well, if there's
02:03:13 one thing I have to say to you,
02:03:15 it's get fucked.
02:03:19 Wait, no, I'm not even weak to rock.
02:03:23 What the fuck are you gonna do then?
02:03:25 Uh...
02:03:29 I'm gonna do something,
02:03:31 and then I'm gonna switch out to something else.
02:03:33 God damn it.
02:03:35 Yeah, bro.
02:03:37 No.
02:03:39 Yes.
02:03:41 Yes.
02:03:43 Um...
02:03:45 His horsey mouth
02:03:47 is too much.
02:03:49 You know what? I'll just let you do it.
02:03:51 I don't fucking care.
02:03:53 What a crazy man to do such a thing.
02:03:55 Yeah.
02:03:57 I don't know what he's in for at this point in his life.
02:03:59 I don't think he knows.
02:04:01 I don't think he realizes the magnitude.
02:04:03 Oh,
02:04:05 stupid.
02:04:07 Fucking worthless.
02:04:11 Fucking worthless.
02:04:13 I don't think he understands
02:04:15 what a pickle, Ben, say, truly is in.
02:04:17 I don't yet.
02:04:19 I don't yet understand the magnitude.
02:04:23 Oh, no.
02:04:25 Yes. Oh, dear.
02:04:27 Oh, no, it's okay. It's okay. It's good.
02:04:29 In fact, it's good. In fact, I'm glad.
02:04:31 In fact,
02:04:33 it is truly great.
02:04:35 Oh,
02:04:37 interesting choice, faggot.
02:04:39 Oh, no!
02:04:41 What the fuck? Oh, cool. I didn't think it
02:04:43 would be that good.
02:04:49 What the fuck are you thinking?
02:04:51 I know what you're thinking.
02:04:53 You're thinking
02:04:55 Ben St.
02:04:57 Maybe he's a cool guy who doesn't
02:04:59 cheat after all.
02:05:01 Well, I would be so wrong.
02:05:03 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:05:05 I'm about to
02:05:07 witness
02:05:09 the most cheating of it all.
02:05:11 Yeah, I think you're about
02:05:13 I think you're about to.
02:05:15 Oh, I was playing it street because I thought
02:05:17 you, god damn it.
02:05:19 What did you think I was going to do?
02:05:21 I thought you were going to try and be
02:05:23 sneaky and
02:05:25 switch out. I was.
02:05:27 I did have a sneaky plan, but I was like
02:05:29 that's stupid. God damn it.
02:05:31 Okay, okay.
02:05:33 Oh, yeah. Oh, wow.
02:05:35 Oh, yeah, I'll do it now.
02:05:37 I picked the best team.
02:05:39 I picked the best team. You just pick the strongest
02:05:41 Pokemon and then you win. You just pick all the mega
02:05:43 evolutions and then you win, dude.
02:05:45 It's not even fucking. It doesn't even matter.
02:05:47 I've got 10 mega evolutions on my team.
02:05:49 I got mega kill great.
02:05:51 I got mega grout on.
02:05:53 Whatever.
02:05:55 What fucking ever, bro.
02:05:57 I got mega, wait, mega Wormadan.
02:05:59 He's the best. He's my favorite.
02:06:01 Whatever, bro. It's not even fucking impressive.
02:06:03 Yeah, it's pretty cool though.
02:06:05 No, god damn it.
02:06:07 Yeah, bro.
02:06:09 I use ice beam, bro.
02:06:13 Ah, shit.
02:06:15 It's so gay.
02:06:17 Okay, you want to do one more?
02:06:19 Yeah, one more, one more.
02:06:21 This will never stop.
02:06:23 No.
02:06:25 Pokemon is the greatest game of all time.
02:06:27 Oh shit, I did a random.
02:06:29 I'm not fighting another rando.
02:06:31 Oh wait, why are you sure?
02:06:33 I did both. Okay.
02:06:35 No, I'm in here. You got your Yan mega.
02:06:37 Why do you have another Yan mega?
02:06:39 I don't know.
02:06:41 That's gay.
02:06:43 In a way.
02:06:45 Nobody can beat pherothorn.
02:06:47 Nobody.
02:06:49 Not a single.
02:06:51 I'm serious, pherothorn is completely overpowered.
02:06:53 He's not even fair.
02:07:05 I know exactly what I'm doing.
02:07:07 Oh wow, okay.
02:07:09 Well, I'm surprised by that.
02:07:11 Oh dear.
02:07:13 Ah shit.
02:07:23 Oh dear.
02:07:25 Oh no.
02:07:27 Oh no.
02:07:41 Okay, okay.
02:07:45 Oh.
02:07:47 Well.
02:07:53 You're gay, by the way.
02:07:55 Before this utter destruction
02:07:57 just absolutely ravages you.
02:07:59 I wanted to let you know that I know
02:08:01 more than you could ever know.
02:08:03 No, that can't be true.
02:08:05 It's impossible.
02:08:07 What are you going to do?
02:08:09 I think you bullshit it.
02:08:11 Are you going to try and pull on me?
02:08:13 I'm mass producing weapons in the east
02:08:15 and I'm going to retake the country.
02:08:17 Oh fuck that dude.
02:08:19 So bad.
02:08:23 I don't even know why you even bother.
02:08:27 God fucking damn it.
02:08:29 Alright.
02:08:31 Okay, what do I got here?
02:08:33 What do, oh I see.
02:08:35 Yes, I see. I have the ultimate strategy.
02:08:37 The ultimate strategy is just use Volcanion
02:08:39 because he's the best Pokemon.
02:08:45 Yeah, it's totally not fair that my team
02:08:47 has pherothorn and Volcanion.
02:08:51 Yeah, well we're in doubt
02:08:53 fucking kill each other.
02:08:55 They're the best Pokemon.
02:08:57 Oh, bullshit.
02:08:59 Guess who it is.
02:09:01 It's the game.
02:09:03 It's the game.
02:09:05 Back in the fucking dead.
02:09:07 And I know what he's going to do too.
02:09:09 I know exactly what he's going to do.
02:09:11 God damn you knew!
02:09:13 I knew! I knew!
02:09:15 I remember it.
02:09:17 Oh, he might still...
02:09:19 This might still fuck me though.
02:09:23 I can't believe it.
02:09:25 He used his memory against me.
02:09:29 That's just what you do with an alomololo.
02:09:31 He used his memory
02:09:33 to create.
02:09:35 The ghost of fucking the game
02:09:37 came and whispered in my ear.
02:09:45 I don't have that great of options here.
02:09:51 I can't believe it.
02:09:53 Yeah, iron barbs.
02:09:55 You knocked my rocky helmet off.
02:09:57 Oh man.
02:09:59 Well...
02:10:01 That was good.
02:10:03 Good while it lasted.
02:10:19 Does it matter?
02:10:21 Shit.
02:10:23 Damn it.
02:10:31 I'm gonna get ya.
02:10:33 Yeah, I got ya.
02:10:35 Does it matter?
02:10:37 Doesn't even matter.
02:10:51 Okay.
02:10:53 Okay.
02:10:57 Please God, please, please.
02:10:59 Well, you're gonna sleep powder.
02:11:01 No, I'm not.
02:11:03 I would never do that.
02:11:07 Wait.
02:11:09 But now that you know that I know you're gonna sleep powder,
02:11:11 now you're gonna not sleep powder.
02:11:13 I would never do that.
02:11:15 In the first place, I never was going to.
02:11:17 Yes, you fucking were.
02:11:21 Well, I mean, I haven't really
02:11:23 gained anything, but I guess...
02:11:29 Um...
02:11:31 Shit.
02:11:33 You really foiled me, babe.
02:11:35 Yeah, I got ya.
02:11:37 Um...
02:11:39 Oh God.
02:11:41 Yeah, okay.
02:11:43 Enjoy that one HP you just absorbed from me.
02:11:45 Thanks.
02:11:47 I will.
02:11:49 Fag it.
02:11:51 Come on!
02:11:53 No!
02:11:55 That's not true.
02:11:57 Little did Ben know that
02:11:59 once you looked through his diary beforehand.
02:12:01 No!
02:12:03 Digi gave me the key for a return
02:12:05 for some Mike's Heart Eliminator.
02:12:07 That son of a bitch.
02:12:17 Okay, dude.
02:12:19 Okay, dude.
02:12:21 Oh, yeah.
02:12:23 Oh, yeah.
02:12:25 Yeah, bro.
02:12:27 Now you're fucked, dude.
02:12:29 Shit.
02:12:45 What to do?
02:12:47 I got it.
02:12:55 Okay.
02:13:01 What is Munchy
02:13:03 gonna do against these
02:13:05 pro strats?
02:13:07 Okay.
02:13:09 Okay, that's something.
02:13:13 Uh...
02:13:15 Hmm. What does Excelsior
02:13:17 even do?
02:13:19 He does this.
02:13:21 He probably just looks gay.
02:13:23 He looks awesome. You're fucking gay.
02:13:25 You were, in fact,
02:13:27 the one who fully revealed the decision
02:13:29 on top of gay men.
02:13:31 No, he does look awesome.
02:13:33 He's edgy.
02:13:35 He's really edgy.
02:13:37 I wish I had a team of Excelsior,
02:13:39 Absol,
02:13:41 Bisharp,
02:13:43 Skarmory.
02:13:45 Who else is edgy?
02:13:47 Oh, Zangus, yeah.
02:13:49 The edgiest Pokemon.
02:13:51 The edgiest team.
02:13:53 The best Pokemon, in fact.
02:13:55 Yes.
02:13:57 Oh, you think you're good,
02:13:59 but in fact, you're bad.
02:14:01 I'm so good.
02:14:09 This man will be
02:14:11 my father.
02:14:13 He'll be my father.
02:14:15 I shall save him
02:14:17 for a later date.
02:14:21 Oh.
02:14:29 Gotcha.
02:14:31 I tricked you.
02:14:33 Did you trick me, or is I the one who tricked you?
02:14:35 I don't know.
02:14:37 That trick that you placed upon me
02:14:39 was, in fact, a trick of great proportions.
02:14:41 A trick so good, in fact,
02:14:43 that I tricked even yourself.
02:14:45 Oh.
02:14:47 That was bad.
02:14:49 Well, that was well tall.
02:14:51 Dude, you're going to die, dude.
02:14:53 You're going to die.
02:14:55 I got damage on you.
02:14:57 You got a little damage, I guess.
02:14:59 I'd do half your health, dude.
02:15:03 Yeah, sure.
02:15:05 Sure.
02:15:07 But you know what they say,
02:15:09 half your health is only worth
02:15:11 a quarter of a Pokemon.
02:15:13 That's not what they say.
02:15:15 That's true.
02:15:17 That's not what they say at all.
02:15:19 That's all true.
02:15:21 That could not be farther, in fact,
02:15:23 from what they say.
02:15:25 I hear that all the time.
02:15:27 I hear your lies all the time.
02:15:29 What? No, boo.
02:15:31 Gay.
02:15:33 Okay, I didn't expect that.
02:15:35 I don't know why I didn't expect that.
02:15:37 That was the obvious thing you were going to do
02:15:39 against you, Vel'Thal.
02:15:41 Shit, that's really stupid.
02:15:43 So stupid.
02:15:45 That's really stupid.
02:15:49 What the fuck do you think
02:15:51 I'm not going to do it still?
02:15:53 I don't know.
02:15:55 At least I didn't lose anyone
02:15:57 yet.
02:16:01 Damn it.
02:16:03 Yeah.
02:16:05 Yeah, bro.
02:16:07 Yeah, bro. Yeah, you know it, dog.
02:16:09 Oh, that's
02:16:11 that stealth rock, though.
02:16:13 It doesn't matter.
02:16:17 Yeah, it matters.
02:16:19 It matters to me.
02:16:21 It doesn't matter a single.
02:16:23 Oh, dear.
02:16:25 What's even the point of that?
02:16:27 That's what it is.
02:16:29 Oh, shit.
02:16:31 I don't think you can kill me, though.
02:16:33 I don't think you can kill me.
02:16:35 Yeah.
02:16:41 Yeah.
02:16:43 Damn it, if it wasn't for that crit,
02:16:45 I might have lived.
02:16:47 Which, what, did I just crit on you?
02:16:49 Yeah.
02:16:51 I think I was going to kill you.
02:16:53 Well, I don't know, maybe.
02:16:55 It went down somewhat slowly.
02:16:57 Oh, he's so fucking fast.
02:16:59 I'm so good.
02:17:01 He's so fast.
02:17:03 He's literally the fastest.
02:17:05 Deoxys is literally the fastest
02:17:07 human being on the planet.
02:17:09 What?
02:17:11 He is?
02:17:13 Yeah, I know.
02:17:15 Shit.
02:17:19 He's way too fast.
02:17:21 No, I'm not fast at all.
02:17:23 Actually, so is...
02:17:25 so is Excelsior.
02:17:27 Uh...
02:17:29 Jeez.
02:17:33 Okay.
02:17:47 Well, when I went down,
02:17:49 I guess I wanted to refresh my beautiful voice.
02:17:51 Yeah.
02:17:53 While I talk, I noticed that
02:17:55 there was a
02:17:57 rally's fast food bag
02:17:59 specifically marked for me, and it said
02:18:01 for a munchie, God bless.
02:18:03 And so I hurriedly
02:18:05 grabbed it and ran it up into my room
02:18:07 to stuff my face with spicy chicken wings.
02:18:09 Yeah.
02:18:11 Did I tell you that I fried chicken before
02:18:13 and I fucked it up?
02:18:15 Yes, you did.
02:18:17 You were so happy
02:18:19 to be able to say it, I'm dead.
02:18:21 I'm fucked, by the way.
02:18:23 Yeah, that was it.
02:18:25 Whatever.
02:18:27 You were so happy, dude, to say it again
02:18:29 you were in the middle of explaining the fried chicken story.
02:18:31 And then you hushed yourself and said
02:18:33 no, I need to say this on camera.
02:18:35 Oh, yeah.
02:18:37 No, that wasn't the story.
02:18:39 No, there were other...
02:18:41 No, no, it's not true.
02:18:43 It's not true. My fried chicken story is gay.
02:18:45 Oh shit, I forgot to hit rematch.
02:18:47 Oh shit.
02:18:49 How long have we been going?
02:18:51 Two hours?
02:18:53 A little more than two hours.
02:18:55 God, but I just can't stop playing Pokemon.
02:18:57 No, no, it's impossible.
02:18:59 It's literally the greatest game of all time.
02:19:01 Oh look, I have Steve Vani on my team.
02:19:03 Haha, that's a Twitter joke.
02:19:05 Steve Vani.
02:19:07 Yeah, basically.
02:19:09 I mean, I get it.
02:19:11 It's because Lucario's gay, right? Like Steve Vani.
02:19:13 Yeah, exactly.
02:19:15 That's fine.
02:19:17 That's all good.
02:19:19 I like everything.
02:19:21 And it's cool.
02:19:23 Um, fuck.
02:19:25 No, no, no, no.
02:19:27 No, no, no, no, no.
02:19:29 Meltank is such a good Pokemon.
02:19:31 Meltank is good.
02:19:33 I'm so proud of it.
02:19:35 Meltank is a great poke, man.
02:19:39 Oh man, this is just like my battle against
02:19:41 Internet99.1.
02:19:43 Started with the Whiskash.
02:19:45 Started with the Whiskash, now we hear.
02:19:49 I don't get paid to blow up like the World Trade.
02:19:51 Started with the Whiskash, now we
02:19:53 fighting
02:19:55 Steve Vani
02:19:57 on the Internet.
02:19:59 I mean, the heated
02:20:01 Internet debate with Steve Vani.
02:20:03 Oh, Steven Universe descent.
02:20:05 Descent.
02:20:07 Nerd, oh you fool.
02:20:09 Oh, that was the naive thing to do.
02:20:11 Hey, yes.
02:20:13 Here, I'm about to show you how stupid you are.
02:20:15 No!
02:20:17 No!
02:20:19 You were
02:20:21 Fuck you, man.
02:20:23 Not a scratch. Look, 100%
02:20:25 not even a scratch.
02:20:27 Yeah, I see that. Yeah, it's good.
02:20:29 I'm so mad that
02:20:31 Mega Evolution are still in
02:20:33 Southern Moon.
02:20:35 It's so bad.
02:20:37 Um, I don't care.
02:20:39 I'm fine with it. I think Z-moves seem really
02:20:41 stupid, but I don't know.
02:20:43 Maybe they'll be fine.
02:20:45 Maybe they'll just be like
02:20:47 I don't know, just the way that
02:20:49 just the fact that they have these big long
02:20:51 ass animations makes me hate them.
02:20:53 I mean, if they were just
02:20:55 a move like any other
02:20:57 I don't know. I mean, I guess
02:20:59 they could be balanced.
02:21:01 They're just the same as in
02:21:03 Gen 5, like the type of
02:21:05 gems.
02:21:07 The type gems?
02:21:09 Yeah, oh my fucking god.
02:21:11 Dude.
02:21:13 It's type advantage.
02:21:15 Let me, well, Munchy, you see
02:21:17 when a Pokemon uses an ability
02:21:19 that has an advantage over one
02:21:21 or more of the enemy's types.
02:21:23 I forgot what Lucario is saying.
02:21:25 Shit, fuck. Shit, shit, shit, shit.
02:21:27 Shit, shit, shit.
02:21:29 Um...
02:21:31 Hmm...
02:21:33 What is Furret gonna do? Something idiotic,
02:21:35 I'm sure. Something idiotic.
02:21:37 Something just so fucking foolish.
02:21:39 Something that's too
02:21:41 embarrassed himself.
02:21:43 Hahaha.
02:21:45 Hahaha.
02:21:47 Hahaha.
02:21:49 Okay, okay.
02:21:51 Oh, you mother fucker, you'll pay.
02:21:53 Yeah, I know.
02:21:55 You will pay in time.
02:21:57 I know, dude.
02:21:59 Oh, my focus sash.
02:22:01 Come on.
02:22:03 Bitch.
02:22:05 What the fuck are you thinking?
02:22:07 What the fuck are you thinking?
02:22:09 What are you thinking, bro?
02:22:11 You can't beat Miletank.
02:22:13 Miletank's just gonna drink that milk.
02:22:15 Like, I mean, that rain.
02:22:17 Like, it drinks its own milk every day.
02:22:19 All day, every day.
02:22:21 Mother fucker.
02:22:23 You're done. You're done.
02:22:25 No, don't be stupid, man.
02:22:27 Don't say that stupid shit
02:22:29 at me.
02:22:31 Um...
02:22:33 Hmm...
02:22:35 I'm gonna kill you.
02:22:37 I'm gonna kill you right fucking now.
02:22:39 No, dude.
02:22:41 No, bro.
02:22:43 There's only one way.
02:22:45 Idiot, you're stupid.
02:22:47 You're so stupid.
02:22:49 You're so stupid.
02:22:51 Everything about you, I hate.
02:22:53 Everything about you, I hate.
02:22:55 Oh, dear.
02:22:57 What a shame.
02:22:59 It's okay, man.
02:23:01 It's good in fact.
02:23:03 It's good in fact.
02:23:05 It's better this way.
02:23:07 Wait, um...
02:23:09 Ugh, I'm so gay.
02:23:13 I mean...
02:23:15 Hmm...
02:23:21 Oh!
02:23:23 Interesting.
02:23:25 Interesting texture.
02:23:29 Wait, why would you do that?
02:23:31 Unless you've got something with Arena Trap
02:23:33 that you're gonna switch into.
02:23:35 Shadow Tag or something.
02:23:37 You don't know that.
02:23:39 That's the only way this would be a reasonable strategy.
02:23:41 You don't know that.
02:23:43 Tee-hee.
02:23:47 Ah, fuck.
02:23:49 You don't know that at all.
02:23:55 You don't fucking know a thing.
02:23:57 Ah, damn it.
02:23:59 Oh, god.
02:24:05 Pfft.
02:24:17 You're gonna perish, dude.
02:24:19 No, I'm not gonna perish at all.
02:24:21 I think you might perish.
02:24:23 I'm gonna do, in fact, the opposite of perish, in fact.
02:24:25 No, you're gonna get perish right now.
02:24:27 Oh, damn.
02:24:29 It would have been really good if I'd woken up.
02:24:31 It would have been real cool.
02:24:33 What the fuck, Currim?
02:24:35 He's a little bitch today.
02:24:37 So bad.
02:24:39 I know. No, but this is gonna do it. You're done.
02:24:41 No, well, no, well.
02:24:43 Yeah, focus glass, yeah, yeah.
02:24:45 No.
02:24:47 You know what they say, early bird gets the worm.
02:24:49 Yo, hey, what's the name of your...
02:24:51 What's the title of your comic?
02:24:53 Investigator.
02:24:55 Oh, god.
02:24:57 It's so obvious in retrospect.
02:24:59 Yeah.
02:25:01 Why did I even ask?
02:25:03 When's it coming out?
02:25:05 I don't fucking know.
02:25:07 Tell me, idiot.
02:25:09 You bastard.
02:25:11 When you pray.
02:25:13 When you go to church and you pray.
02:25:15 I don't pray.
02:25:17 My righteous prayers will reach you.
02:25:19 Dude, I really want to read it.
02:25:21 I mean, it sounds fucking
02:25:23 weird and bizarre.
02:25:25 I'm done.
02:25:27 Yeah, you're done.
02:25:29 I don't even have this one.
02:25:31 I don't know, man. It sounds really weird and like...
02:25:33 I don't know.
02:25:35 I don't know what to expect from like...
02:25:37 Oh, come on!
02:25:39 Oh, but it's
02:25:41 all for nothing.
02:25:43 But it's all for fucking
02:25:45 not.
02:25:47 Unless you've got...
02:25:49 Yeah, okay.
02:25:51 There's in fact nothing.
02:25:53 Oh,
02:25:57 the drizzle bed.
02:25:59 Whatever, you stupid bastard.
02:26:01 No.
02:26:05 Wait, I don't understand why you did
02:26:07 parish song.
02:26:09 Because I thought you were going to switch out
02:26:11 and then I didn't want you to have
02:26:13 the upper hand and have access
02:26:15 to what you wanted to switch into.
02:26:17 Okay, I was reading way too much into it.
02:26:23 Damn it.
02:26:27 Damn it.
02:26:31 Oh, that choice scarf.
02:26:33 That was a great, that was a great
02:26:35 kirim.
02:26:37 It was in fact correct.
02:26:39 It might have been the greatest kirim of all time.
02:26:41 Whatever.
02:26:43 What's this fucking piece of shit?
02:26:45 I don't know.
02:26:47 Some gay shit, you know.
02:26:49 You know. God,
02:26:51 you idiot.
02:26:53 I can't believe you would do something so stupid.
02:26:55 What's that about?
02:26:57 I can't believe you would do something so stupid.
02:26:59 That was embarrassing.
02:27:01 I admit.
02:27:03 I admit it.
02:27:05 I am gay.
02:27:07 I admit that nothing I do will ever matter.
02:27:13 I'm just going to have to
02:27:15 debuff you
02:27:17 to oblivion.
02:27:19 This special defense will be through the floor
02:27:21 by the time I'm done with you.
02:27:23 Oh, God.
02:27:25 Not this shit again.
02:27:27 Doesn't matter.
02:27:29 No, I'm going to lose you.
02:27:31 I'm fucking Nate's over.
02:27:33 Damn, it's not even cool.
02:27:35 It's not even fair.
02:27:37 It's not even right. There's no reason to fight.
02:27:39 And yet this is our daily life.
02:27:41 Shit, I close it again.
02:27:45 Oh, my fucking God.
02:27:47 I can't...
02:27:49 You will...
02:27:51 I will see you in hell then.
02:27:53 I can't wait, dude.
02:27:55 I can't wait...
02:27:57 I can't wait to Pokemon battle you
02:27:59 in hell forever.
02:28:01 That will be my punishment.
02:28:03 Forever until you
02:28:05 fucking collapse from exhaustion.
02:28:07 You will Pokemon battle.
02:28:13 But it was to no avail.
02:28:15 It was worthless.
02:28:17 No, it was worthless.
02:28:19 Why? No!
02:28:21 Oh, you've crippled me.
02:28:23 LOL.
02:28:25 What do I have? Wait, wait, wait.
02:28:27 Hmm.
02:28:41 Yes.
02:28:43 That was a weird... That's shitty.
02:28:45 I made the right... I made the wrong choice.
02:28:47 It's so bad.
02:28:49 Yeah, it's poor. It was poor form on my part
02:28:51 and I apologize.
02:28:57 Seeking...
02:28:59 Seeking's got mega horn.
02:29:01 Look how fast I'm moving.
02:29:03 Look how fast I'm swimming in place.
02:29:05 Yeah, there's not even any water there, idiot.
02:29:07 I think we're in the desert or something.
02:29:09 So just, you know, calm down.
02:29:11 From the look of our terrain,
02:29:13 it looks like we're in like a back alley.
02:29:15 Like you're gonna shank me once we're done with this.
02:29:17 Well, that's true.
02:29:19 Unrelated to the terrain.
02:29:21 Seeking's got...
02:29:23 He's probably got mega horn.
02:29:27 And that makes me so mad.
02:29:29 I have an irrational hate
02:29:31 of seeking and gullting.
02:29:33 I think they're the worst Pokemon ever made.
02:29:35 They're not great.
02:29:37 I don't know. I don't hate them.
02:29:39 I mean, a lot of Pokemon
02:29:41 and especially
02:29:43 first gen are just
02:29:45 animals.
02:29:47 Like they're just animals.
02:29:49 And it's bizarre.
02:29:51 Um...
02:29:53 And that really...
02:29:55 Did you get the two?
02:29:57 What?
02:29:59 Yeah, yeah, it says you left.
02:30:01 Hold on. Reconnect.
02:30:03 That was quite odd.
02:30:05 My Internet
02:30:07 did not go out.
02:30:09 It was in fact
02:30:11 it was a Pokemon showdown
02:30:13 like eviction notice.
02:30:15 Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
02:30:17 Said you left, but...
02:30:19 Apart
02:30:21 from my investigator,
02:30:23 I'm also working on a decently
02:30:25 sized novel.
02:30:27 Are you? Is that true?
02:30:29 That's more true than you could ever know.
02:30:31 Okay.
02:30:33 With my...
02:30:35 I've talked about this before on the PCP
02:30:37 in my interview.
02:30:39 He got mad at me
02:30:41 for talking about it before.
02:30:43 Who did?
02:30:45 I'm working on it with
02:30:47 a good old friend of mine.
02:30:49 My co-host on almost all of my streams.
02:30:51 And we are working on a...
02:30:53 Shit. Fucking crit. Okay.
02:30:55 I would describe it as a
02:30:57 political novel
02:30:59 about every group,
02:31:01 every demographic of people that we hate.
02:31:03 Um...
02:31:05 Is it about me?
02:31:07 Well, you will be in it
02:31:09 as a side character and you will be.
02:31:11 You will be...
02:31:13 Your plot ends with you being introduced
02:31:15 to buying ice cream and then being shot up
02:31:17 in a dry by shooting by a game.
02:31:19 Okay. Okay, good.
02:31:21 Great.
02:31:23 In fact...
02:31:25 This novel...
02:31:27 Whatever. It doesn't matter.
02:31:29 It follows a...
02:31:31 A...
02:31:33 A normal weed-spoking
02:31:35 gamer who gets transported...
02:31:37 Oh, dude. Yes. Yes.
02:31:39 I do know this, but go on.
02:31:41 Who gets transported
02:31:43 about...
02:31:45 Wait. Was this...
02:31:47 I feel like I've read this, but it wasn't a
02:31:49 novel. Did I read like a...
02:31:51 Did I read like the first chapter or something?
02:31:53 Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
02:31:55 Who gets transported to the future
02:31:57 via Obama's request
02:31:59 to...
02:32:01 He had a...
02:32:03 He had sacred prowess and knew that
02:32:05 in the future, the Islamic state
02:32:07 would vow to destroy video games forever.
02:32:09 And thus...
02:32:11 That's right. That's what they do.
02:32:13 Plunging into a...
02:32:15 An era of distress like no other.
02:32:17 An era of distress.
02:32:19 Oh, no. Yes.
02:32:21 And therefore, it is John.
02:32:23 John Majors is the way
02:32:25 word weed-smoking gamer
02:32:27 who vows to destroy Islam
02:32:29 forever and bring peace to
02:32:31 the world. God, what a view.
02:32:33 Via video games.
02:32:35 Uh, how...
02:32:37 Well, when can... When's the release date on that?
02:32:39 I mean, I want... The release date on that...
02:32:41 Uh...
02:32:43 I would say
02:32:45 mid-2017
02:32:47 for that.
02:32:49 As it is...
02:32:51 It is quite the endeavor.
02:32:53 I did not expect there to actually be a release date.
02:32:55 I gotta say it.
02:32:57 I'm very impressed already with this book.
02:32:59 Just for the fact that
02:33:01 it presumes to
02:33:03 ever come out at all.
02:33:05 The...
02:33:07 That's the large plot, but
02:33:09 the way John hopes
02:33:11 to destroy
02:33:13 Islam forever
02:33:15 is by
02:33:17 winning Evo, which in the future
02:33:19 Evo is in the fine-games tournament.
02:33:21 It's basically... Sports are extinct in video games
02:33:23 or sports now. And sports is like...
02:33:25 They basically don't exist.
02:33:27 And Evo is like a Super Bowl.
02:33:29 But the Super Bowl isn't just about football.
02:33:31 It's about every sport ever.
02:33:33 Good.
02:33:35 So basically, winning...
02:33:37 Yeah, yeah, you like that Custab Berry?
02:33:39 Yeah, you like that explosion, bro?
02:33:41 It didn't affect me.
02:33:43 I know, but I just wanted to do it.
02:33:47 Anyway, he has to go around
02:33:49 the United States
02:33:51 in various video game
02:33:53 Arcadiums and beat the shit out of people.
02:33:55 Various video game Arcadiums?
02:33:57 Okay.
02:33:59 That sentence made sense.
02:34:03 And defeat all
02:34:05 Islamic presence in the United States
02:34:07 and he shipped off to Mecca.
02:34:09 Does he do it in video games?
02:34:11 Is how he defeats them?
02:34:13 Or does he do it out of video games, too?
02:34:15 No, no.
02:34:17 He utterly defeats them
02:34:19 by destroying them in video games.
02:34:21 So much that they want to commit suicide
02:34:23 and do it instantaneously.
02:34:25 That's the superpower?
02:34:27 Yeah.
02:34:29 No!
02:34:31 No!
02:34:33 What a bunch of fucking bullshit.
02:34:35 I know what you're saying.
02:34:37 Yeah, you feel me on this, bro?
02:34:39 Yeah, you idiot.
02:34:41 Yeah, you dummy.
02:34:43 You're the fucking worst.
02:34:45 It doesn't matter.
02:34:47 No, but guess what?
02:34:49 Yeah, you think that's cool?
02:34:51 You think that's cool?
02:34:53 It's nothing.
02:34:55 It's literally nothing.
02:34:57 You're literally going to die right now.
02:35:01 Yeah, bro!
02:35:03 Heel bell, bro!
02:35:05 That's...
02:35:07 That's crazy.
02:35:09 That's cruel.
02:35:11 It's cruel on unusual, I know.
02:35:13 But I did it anyway.
02:35:15 This guy's probably going to mega-evolve.
02:35:17 But, you know...
02:35:19 One of the characters
02:35:21 in John Major, American Gamer.
02:35:23 That's the title.
02:35:25 American Gamer?
02:35:27 Yeah, okay.
02:35:29 Is a man by the name of...
02:35:31 Did he get even slower when he mega-evolved?
02:35:33 Yes.
02:35:35 Wow, okay.
02:35:37 It is a man by the name of Tweet Burglar,
02:35:39 who a fan of my Twitter
02:35:41 will know is a character
02:35:43 I like to attribute to Nate,
02:35:45 as he often steals tweets.
02:35:47 Oh, yeah!
02:35:49 Last time she did good, I'll see you in hell.
02:35:51 And he is the CEO of a tweeting empire,
02:35:53 and he steals tweets from people.
02:35:55 Wait, wait, wait.
02:35:57 This is Nate?
02:35:59 Well, I often attributed this to Nate,
02:36:01 but he's his own character now,
02:36:03 since I liked him so much.
02:36:05 Okay, so actual Nate is an investigator.
02:36:07 Yeah.
02:36:09 And this is just like a sort of spiritual
02:36:11 we-nate.
02:36:13 Anyway, his name is Tweet Burglar.
02:36:15 Yes.
02:36:17 Good, okay.
02:36:19 He steals tweets from
02:36:21 not as popular Twitter's,
02:36:23 and uses them on his own super Twitter,
02:36:25 and he gets all the love and attention
02:36:27 for it.
02:36:29 Not only does he steal tweets,
02:36:31 but he steals the memories of tweets ever happening.
02:36:33 Oh my god.
02:36:35 If you make a tweet and he steals it,
02:36:37 you won't even remember making that tweet.
02:36:39 And through this, he can control information
02:36:41 since people tweet about natural disasters
02:36:43 and terrorist attacks.
02:36:45 He can make sure people can't even remember it.
02:36:49 Because he can just like
02:36:51 remove the tweets from existence
02:36:53 by stealing them?
02:36:55 Interesting.
02:36:57 You know, you control the flow of information.
02:36:59 You control everything.
02:37:01 Yeah, exactly.
02:37:03 Another one of the elite gaming
02:37:05 administrators
02:37:07 is named Daryl Pluto.
02:37:09 He's sponsored by Arby's.
02:37:11 He's black and he's really fat.
02:37:13 He doesn't have any arms,
02:37:15 because they were blown off in the war.
02:37:17 And instead of arms, he has USB 3 ports.
02:37:19 Okay.
02:37:21 Sure.
02:37:23 Sure, alright.
02:37:29 And he wears a gold chain
02:37:31 that says Arby's on it as a necklace.
02:37:33 And I just don't have his shirt on, ever.
02:37:35 God fucking damn it, Lilligan.
02:37:37 You're so bad.
02:37:39 You fail me every time.
02:37:41 Just fucking kill yourself, my man.
02:37:43 I want to.
02:37:53 We're also going to have a lot of real people in it,
02:37:55 such as Obama.
02:37:57 Obama's going to be a major character,
02:37:59 as well as
02:38:01 of Quake Arena
02:38:03 esports theme, Fatality,
02:38:05 aka Jonathan Wendell.
02:38:07 I have no idea
02:38:09 what you're talking about right now.
02:38:13 Who is in fact the greatest
02:38:15 Quake 3 Arena player of all time
02:38:17 for a short while.
02:38:19 Really? He's not even still
02:38:21 the greatest Quake 3 Arena player.
02:38:23 Even that
02:38:25 small thing has been
02:38:27 stripped away from it.
02:38:31 Holy shit.
02:38:35 There's also going to
02:38:37 be a character by the name
02:38:39 of Cobra Kisser, who is John's worst nightmare.
02:38:41 He's French
02:38:43 and he's a serial rapist
02:38:45 and he...
02:38:47 That's his character. And he likes snakes.
02:38:49 He's magic.
02:38:51 Cobra Kisser.
02:38:53 Did you say he's gay
02:38:55 and he's a serial rapist?
02:38:57 Yeah, and he's French.
02:38:59 And he's French, sure. That's fine.
02:39:01 That's fine.
02:39:03 That's okay.
02:39:05 With me.
02:39:09 Let me get the entire list,
02:39:11 because even just talking about the carries themselves
02:39:13 is rewarding and innovative
02:39:15 of himself.
02:39:17 One of the
02:39:19 elite 4 game administrators
02:39:21 is the name of Sandy Hook
02:39:23 and she's a pirate.
02:39:25 Sure. That's all we know about her yet
02:39:27 for now.
02:39:29 Is that our new Sandy Hook?
02:39:31 Come on, Blissey.
02:39:33 Just sweet, sweet dreams.
02:39:37 The CEO of Sony
02:39:39 is a major character and his name is Rick Blast
02:39:41 and he's just a floating head
02:39:43 in a jar. He's in the future,
02:39:45 and he's bought out by a torturer's
02:39:47 guild.
02:39:49 And the PS5
02:39:51 is an Iron Maiden.
02:39:53 That's just it?
02:39:55 It's just an Iron Maiden
02:39:57 is the PlayStation 5?
02:39:59 And also
02:40:01 it's like 50,000
02:40:03 years in the future, but they're still
02:40:05 making...
02:40:07 They only just recently came out the PS5
02:40:09 because the PS4 is such a pro for its gaming system
02:40:11 with so many games on it that it lasted
02:40:13 for eons.
02:40:15 Eons?
02:40:21 Dammit.
02:40:23 The gravy train had to end sometime.
02:40:31 Balls, dude.
02:40:33 Oh, my god.
02:40:35 That's all a critical hit did?
02:40:37 Oh, my god.
02:40:39 So bad.
02:40:41 I know.
02:40:43 And by the way,
02:40:45 this was made like
02:40:47 maybe like a year and a half ago.
02:40:49 We started a project on this.
02:40:51 Yeah, I read that a long time ago.
02:40:53 It feels like.
02:40:55 But we're
02:40:57 actually
02:40:59 we're actually
02:41:01 but we're
02:41:03 we're we are an intensely dedicated
02:41:05 to it at this point.
02:41:07 Good.
02:41:09 Fuck, I'm not going to make it.
02:41:11 This toxic skin, this toxic skin
02:41:13 to fucking get me. No!
02:41:17 So bad.
02:41:19 So bad.
02:41:21 I really thought I could
02:41:23 turn it around a little bit.
02:41:25 No, of course not.
02:41:27 During our
02:41:29 game, I became deeply infatuated
02:41:31 with the story of the Zodiac Killer.
02:41:33 Yeah, sure.
02:41:35 And I turned him
02:41:37 into a character named the Wii U
02:41:39 Torturer.
02:41:41 Okay.
02:41:43 He's basically the Zodiac Killer,
02:41:45 but instead of people, he kills Wii U's.
02:41:47 Okay.
02:41:49 I'm going to read the description for him right now.
02:41:51 I have a giant Wiki dedicated
02:41:53 to cataloging these various characters.
02:41:55 And I'm going to read the description for him
02:41:57 right now as we play Pokemon.
02:41:59 Please do.
02:42:01 His gaming prowess,
02:42:03 which is their special ability,
02:42:05 that's what they call it, gaming prowess,
02:42:07 is breaking and breakable.
02:42:09 And his personality is the most violent person
02:42:11 you will ever meet.
02:42:13 But only when Wii U's are involved.
02:42:15 Anyone who is unfortunate enough to be in the same room
02:42:17 with Arthur and Wii U together
02:42:19 will witness the most graphic display of onscreen violence
02:42:21 they will ever see.
02:42:23 He has almost a fetishistic impulse
02:42:25 like an old bean.
02:42:27 Hides his deadly Wii U
02:42:29 obsession at all costs.
02:42:33 The reason he's like this
02:42:35 is because he got a PS4 for his
02:42:37 birthday when he was 10.
02:42:39 And he wanted a Wii U.
02:42:41 So, so now like
02:42:43 since he couldn't have one.
02:42:45 Wait, how old is he now?
02:42:47 He's like 38.
02:42:49 Wait.
02:42:51 Wait, so this is the future.
02:42:53 Wait, so the Wii U is like a completely
02:42:55 empty console, but this boy
02:42:57 is totally irrelevant.
02:43:03 Oh, oh, oh.
02:43:05 Here's one you're going to really like.
02:43:07 You're going to really love this one.
02:43:09 Oh, for sakes, dude.
02:43:11 Why did it have to be Flygon?
02:43:13 You're so bad, anyway.
02:43:15 His name is IndieIndiaIndiana
02:43:17 and he's the CEO of Undertale Incorporated.
02:43:19 Wait, so
02:43:21 okay, I remember IndieIndiaIndiana
02:43:23 but I forget, wait,
02:43:25 I forgot that it was
02:43:27 Undertale Incorporated.
02:43:31 And he has single-handedly
02:43:33 he through
02:43:35 marriages
02:43:37 and backstabbing, he has become the sole
02:43:39 proprietor of
02:43:41 Toby Fox's legacy, his Undertale
02:43:43 fortune. And he has used that
02:43:45 money to buy
02:43:47 every indie game ever made
02:43:49 sure that
02:43:51 no quality titles can be released under them.
02:43:55 Why would he do such a thing?
02:43:57 Why is he so evil?
02:44:01 No quality
02:44:03 titles
02:44:05 ever.
02:44:07 And every indie game
02:44:09 now is just like a
02:44:11 based off like Cookie Clicker, Tetris
02:44:13 or Candy Crush.
02:44:15 Sure.
02:44:17 I mean, why wouldn't it be?
02:44:23 Aw, come on!
02:44:25 And a fun fact, he used to be
02:44:27 a McDonald's manager
02:44:29 before he became CEO
02:44:31 before he got his scheme in his head
02:44:33 to destroy indie games.
02:44:39 A what manager?
02:44:41 A McDonald's manager.
02:44:43 Oh, okay, makes sense. Why is he
02:44:45 so cruel?
02:44:47 He had to be explored.
02:44:49 Okay, okay.
02:44:51 All we know at this point is that
02:44:53 he deeply does.
02:44:55 Okay, dude, your zygarde's dead.
02:44:57 No, it's not. Yeah, it's Ice Punch, Nigger.
02:44:59 Yeah.
02:45:01 Ice Punch, come on, Nigger.
02:45:03 Ice Punch, Nigger.
02:45:09 The fact that I have warm damn on my team
02:45:11 means that there's nothing I can
02:45:13 fucking do.
02:45:15 I know.
02:45:17 It's pitiful, really.
02:45:19 My team was like made to just lose
02:45:21 to Toxicrypt. Like, I have no switch into it.
02:45:23 Yeah, am I gonna completely
02:45:25 sweep your team with Toxicrypt?
02:45:27 I think you very well might.
02:45:29 I think, well, I don't know
02:45:31 if I can do it with this guy.
02:45:33 Probably no.
02:45:35 Yeah, I don't have the moves.
02:45:39 Oh, shit.
02:45:41 Damn it.
02:45:43 I was gonna Ice Punch you.
02:45:45 I was gonna Ice Punch you.
02:45:47 But it just didn't happen.
02:45:49 It just didn't happen that way.
02:45:51 You know what I'm saying?
02:45:53 Yeah, you know what I'm fucking saying, dude.
02:45:55 I'll check this out, motherfucker.
02:45:57 No, that's bad.
02:45:59 I don't like that.
02:46:01 Oh, dear.
02:46:03 I see.
02:46:05 Oh, I see.
02:46:07 Oh, I see.
02:46:09 Do you?
02:46:11 Shit!
02:46:15 Okay.
02:46:17 Whatever.
02:46:19 Idiot.
02:46:21 Bitch.
02:46:23 Uh...
02:46:25 By the way,
02:46:27 I keep alluding to this novel
02:46:29 just because I'm so proud of it.
02:46:31 It's not even close to being done.
02:46:33 There's no specific reason
02:46:35 for me to even say it.
02:46:37 As I feel in the audiences
02:46:39 for Investigator,
02:46:41 which is like a normal story,
02:46:43 and well...
02:46:45 I wouldn't say normal,
02:46:47 but it is in fact
02:46:49 a project of love
02:46:51 and not of hate.
02:46:53 And John Major
02:46:55 are so intensely different
02:46:57 that, uh...
02:46:59 Really?
02:47:01 Again, just to reiterate, the only reason I'm talking about John Major
02:47:03 is because I'm so deeply enthralled
02:47:05 by everything about it
02:47:07 that I'm so proud of it
02:47:09 that I will talk about it from now until the end of time.
02:47:11 Wait.
02:47:13 What the fuck, dude?
02:47:15 What the fuck, man?
02:47:17 This is some bullshit, man.
02:47:19 It's so bad.
02:47:21 I got you, though.
02:47:23 Yeah, whatever.
02:47:25 Wait, you were saying that about
02:47:27 Investigator or about John Major?
02:47:29 Yeah, about John Major.
02:47:31 Well, I'm also very
02:47:33 concerned about
02:47:35 Investigator,
02:47:37 but it's much more
02:47:39 of a story
02:47:41 that could feasibly
02:47:43 mean anything to other people.
02:47:45 So I want to treat it
02:47:47 with a little bit more dignity
02:47:49 than
02:47:51 the John Major.
02:47:53 Wait, dignity?
02:47:55 No, the last time we talked about Investigator,
02:47:57 it was courage and dignity.
02:47:59 Oh, I see.
02:48:01 You said that, and I thought
02:48:03 the idea
02:48:05 of something discovering dignity
02:48:07 was really incredible.
02:48:13 Hmm.
02:48:15 How am I going to crush you this time?
02:48:17 I have so many ways.
02:48:19 Give up, because I just click something
02:48:21 that will make you run for the hills.
02:48:23 Okay, I might as well just fucking
02:48:25 get out and shoot my fucking brains out.
02:48:27 Yeah, I think you might want to consider
02:48:29 that.
02:48:39 What the fuck are you typing?
02:48:41 I'm searching the type
02:48:43 of ship chart.
02:48:45 Yeah, you idiot.
02:48:47 I'm weak to
02:48:49 fighting ground.
02:48:51 Is that it?
02:48:53 Fire,
02:48:57 fighting ground and fire.
02:48:59 You're dead.
02:49:01 Am I? I'm gay.
02:49:03 Yeah, you're very gay.
02:49:05 You're very gay,
02:49:07 and I would appreciate it
02:49:09 if you never did
02:49:11 ever again. Maybe.
02:49:13 Could you perhaps be less gay next time?
02:49:15 Please and thank you.
02:49:17 Please and thank you, sir.
02:49:23 You're dead.
02:49:25 There's nothing you can switch into, though.
02:49:31 You might as well
02:49:33 fucking kill yourself, my man.
02:49:35 Oh, no.
02:49:37 I might as well.
02:49:39 Oh, come on. Crit, really?
02:49:41 Had to be, huh?
02:49:43 Had to be.
02:49:45 Alright, well, whatever.
02:49:47 Registeel,
02:49:49 you've done your duty.
02:49:51 God, I love...
02:49:53 I get such a rush.
02:49:55 Going for that second protect.
02:49:57 It never pays off.
02:50:05 I mean,
02:50:07 if you find yourself going for that second protect,
02:50:09 you're just...
02:50:11 It's just over.
02:50:13 You've gone astray.
02:50:15 You're good as dead.
02:50:17 Yeah, it's over.
02:50:19 It's all over, dude.
02:50:21 Um...
02:50:23 Oh, shit.
02:50:25 Don't even try. Just don't even try.
02:50:27 I'm gonna do it.
02:50:29 Don't even try.
02:50:31 I'm gonna do it.
02:50:33 As a friend, Ben, don't try.
02:50:35 Listen, man.
02:50:37 Don't embarrass yourself any further.
02:50:39 No, no, listen.
02:50:41 No, listen, no.
02:50:43 Yes!
02:50:45 What?
02:50:47 What?
02:50:49 Oh, my God.
02:50:51 I'm just fucking...
02:50:53 It's...
02:50:55 Yeah, bro.
02:50:57 Yeah, bro.
02:50:59 This is the ultimate fucking cheater.
02:51:01 Yeah, yeah.
02:51:03 You're just mad
02:51:05 because of how gay you are.
02:51:07 I'm so frustrated
02:51:09 with my sexuality.
02:51:11 I have to take it out on you.
02:51:13 Yeah, bro.
02:51:15 Yeah, I got something you can take it out on, bro.
02:51:17 Yeah, you know what I'm saying.
02:51:19 Well...
02:51:23 Time to do exactly what I did
02:51:25 in the Elite Four
02:51:27 and just fucking toxic stall my way
02:51:29 into an early grave.
02:51:31 This is...
02:51:33 This is unjust.
02:51:35 No!
02:51:37 The second protect never does it.
02:51:39 That doesn't even matter.
02:51:41 Yeah, no, it doesn't.
02:51:43 No, it doesn't.
02:51:45 But, uh,
02:51:47 fuck you.
02:51:51 Oh, this is just sad.
02:51:55 Don't pity me.
02:51:57 This is where my dam is just...
02:51:59 Oh, dang.
02:52:01 Even that time, the second protect
02:52:03 didn't work.
02:52:05 Don't fucking pity me.
02:52:07 You piece of shit.
02:52:09 It's... come on.
02:52:11 Dude.
02:52:13 Return.
02:52:15 No.
02:52:17 Yeah, there's no escape.
02:52:19 God damn it.
02:52:21 You think I'm going to give you a quick death?
02:52:23 You think again.
02:52:29 I can't believe this.
02:52:31 Yes!
02:52:33 Double protect, it never fails.
02:52:35 It never fails.
02:52:37 I should have seen it coming.
02:52:39 The infinite strat
02:52:41 that never fails to work.
02:52:43 Double protect.
02:52:45 Infinite power.
02:52:47 Ah, you're done.
02:52:51 This is fucking barbaric.
02:52:53 Yeah, this is inhumane.
02:52:55 This is against the Geneva Convention.
02:52:59 Well, how do you like this?
02:53:01 There's...
02:53:03 It's good.
02:53:05 There's a great...
02:53:07 gay...
02:53:11 That fucking sucked, dude.
02:53:13 That sucked real bad.
02:53:15 Yeah, not as bad as you, though.
02:53:17 No, not quite.
02:53:19 There's a great...
02:53:21 Okay, there's a great, like,
02:53:23 fan commentary of
02:53:25 Half-Life
02:53:27 by this guy named Goose Goose.
02:53:29 And then, at one point, he's talking about
02:53:31 the, um...
02:53:33 He's talking about the Combine.
02:53:37 And he's like, you know, this seems like a...
02:53:39 This seems like a...
02:53:41 This seems like, you know, like a...
02:53:43 Like a...
02:53:45 Like a real human rights violation.
02:53:47 Although, I sincerely doubt
02:53:49 that the Combine even read
02:53:51 the Geneva Convention.
02:53:53 Let alone ratified it.
02:53:57 It's got great delivery.
02:53:59 Oh, jeez, yeah.
02:54:01 Those fucking backward pieces of shit.
02:54:03 Didn't even ratified the
02:54:05 Geneva Convention.
02:54:07 They didn't read it. Let'll even read it.
02:54:09 Let alone ratified it.
02:54:11 Okay, okay.
02:54:13 That's enough. Okay, that's a fucking...
02:54:15 Okay, alright.
02:54:17 Okay.
02:54:19 Where's the blood into fucking end it all?
02:54:21 I think we've reached...
02:54:23 I'm just gonna do this.
02:54:25 Oh, yeah, okay.
02:54:27 Just let me have this one.
02:54:29 Yeah, you're gonna let me win this one.
02:54:31 Yeah, you'll give me this one.
02:54:33 Yeah, because I...
02:54:35 I guess I felt so bad for you, because I knew
02:54:37 that you wouldn't win any other way.
02:54:39 Yeah, true.
02:54:41 That I thought you, you know, might as well
02:54:43 just fucking give it to him out of goodness
02:54:45 of my heart.
02:54:47 Alright, you know...
02:54:49 Okay, should we call it quits?
02:54:51 Yeah, yeah.
02:54:53 It's nine in the morning.
02:54:55 I haven't slept.
02:54:57 Yeah, that's fine.
02:54:59 That's way reasonable
02:55:01 that you're up till six in the morning.
02:55:03 Don't you have, like, school or something?
02:55:05 Don't...
02:55:07 I'll make good.
02:55:09 What day of the week is it? It's Wednesday.
02:55:11 Okay, yeah, I knew it.
02:55:13 I'll do what I need to.
02:55:15 You'll do what you have to do. You'll do what must be done.
02:55:17 I'll do what must be done.
02:55:19 You'll do what must be done.
02:55:21 You've got your own agenda.
02:55:23 That's not for me.
02:55:25 I'm paying out for number one.
02:55:27 That's a freeze pop song.
02:55:29 It's a really bad freeze pop song, actually.
02:55:31 Sorry, sorry.
02:55:33 I don't go to gay bars with you
02:55:35 and I don't listen to the...
02:55:37 Well, maybe you should sometime.
02:55:39 Have some gay sex with someone.
02:55:41 I mean, think of...
02:55:43 Open up your eyes.
02:55:45 I mean, think about it.
02:55:47 Okay, I'm thinking about it.
02:55:51 What do you hope to send
02:55:53 to my brain with me thinking about it?
02:55:55 Well, I'm just some gay shit.
02:55:57 Well, then we'll work.
02:55:59 Because I'm talking to you.
02:56:03 Thank you all for coming out
02:56:05 and listening.
02:56:07 Oh, God, I forgot there was people
02:56:09 watching.
02:56:11 You didn't end it.
02:56:13 Oh.
02:56:15 Everyone,
02:56:17 I forgot you were watching.
02:56:19 Thanks for joining us for another
02:56:21 R.F.G.
02:56:23 Wait, another...
02:56:25 R.F.
02:56:27 Rook.
02:56:29 Roof.
02:56:31 Going out on such a strong note.
02:56:33 Maybe next time we'll play
02:56:35 a different game. Probably not, though.
02:56:37 Maybe.
02:56:39 Maybe.
02:56:41 Wait, yes.
02:56:43 Yeah.
02:56:45 Next time we'll beat
02:56:47 fucking Crazy Throne.
02:56:49 Yeah.
02:56:51 We'll beat Crazy Throne.
02:56:53 We'll beat Crazy Taxi.
02:56:55 It'll be all of us.
02:56:57 Yeah, okay.
02:56:59 Good night, everyone.
02:57:01 Stay safe out there, America.
02:57:03 Donald Trump's America.
02:57:05 Stay safe in Donald Trump's
02:57:07 new nightmare dystopian America.
02:57:09 Where the fucking combine
02:57:11 come and beat you in the streets
02:57:13 with their stun sticks.
02:57:15 Where big brothers constantly spying
02:57:17 on each other.
02:57:19 They're gonna do things to you.
02:57:21 Yeah, they're gonna do something.
02:57:23 They're gonna do things to your brain.
02:57:25 You probably won't like it.
02:57:27 Things that you won't like.
02:57:29 Well, things that you won't like,
02:57:31 but in retrospect, you'll look back
02:57:33 and think, actually, I really did like that
02:57:35 because they fucking brainwashed you.
02:57:37 That's what Trump's America is now.
02:57:39 I know. I'm living here.
02:57:41 Welcome to City 17.
02:57:43 Yes. Okay.
