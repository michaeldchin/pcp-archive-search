00:00:00 Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're back. I'm back. I've been away for two weeks. I know y'all miss me, but that's okay.
00:00:11 We're here again. Did you guys didn't show up either? I'm really upset. I invited all of you and everything.
00:00:18 My name is Tom Oliver, and we got a whole brigand of disgusting people with us today, starting with the man himself, Digibro.
00:00:26 I'm gross. Indeed. We have the Hippocrit Gibbontake himself.
00:00:34 I thought you said Barum. That's why I didn't come.
00:00:38 Oh, well, you were right, actually. I fooled everyone. It was a very awkward time for all. Nate is here.
00:00:46 Every side of the dreidel is represented here.
00:00:50 Indeed they are. And Ben Saint.
00:00:53 Yo, I'm back from Anthro New England, baby.
00:00:57 Ah, yes. I got pictures. I got proof. It's true.
00:01:02 Hell yeah. I saw teeth from that all weekend, and I was sad that I couldn't go with my lowers but my brothers regardless.
00:01:11 I'll be interested to hear. You want to tell us about it? I'm very curious.
00:01:16 Did you get it on any sick furry orgy's dog?
00:01:19 That's the most important question. I'm afraid I didn't get to weasel a single person.
00:01:24 Oh, what the fuck? Everything I know is a lie.
00:01:28 Actually, most of my, I mean, I was walking around with Kazi in her new Colby Jack suit, which is fucking, is baller by the way.
00:01:37 I've seen it. It's a well-made unit.
00:01:42 Does someone want to post a picture? It's on her timeline.
00:01:46 I'll find one.
00:01:48 But most of my experience was weird drama, friend drama of some people.
00:01:56 We went to one of their friend's hotel room for a bit, for everyone to get suited up.
00:02:04 He didn't confess he was maybe thinking of voting Republican in the presidential.
00:02:08 He wouldn't do that, right? I mean, he wouldn't tank his whole career doing something like that now, I hope.
00:02:13 I mean, I hope he would have more sense than something like that.
00:02:16 Don't we all.
00:02:17 By the way, there's the image you can see in the show notes.
00:02:21 And then we all left the room and we were going to go to a restaurant to eat.
00:02:25 And then we got to the restaurant and suddenly a bunch of these people are like, we have to go.
00:02:30 And they leave and we're like, what the fuck was that about?
00:02:32 And then we find out when we get back that all these people, all these friends of our friends who had their own hotel room,
00:02:38 they all got fucking weirded out and had anxiety attacks because there were too many of us in the room at one time.
00:02:45 And then they were like, we don't want to see them anymore.
00:02:48 They can't be in here anymore.
00:02:50 They didn't say anything about it. It was only later after the fact.
00:02:53 They're like, we have to fucking form a coalition against these other people.
00:02:57 They can't be allowed to intrude on our personal space any further.
00:03:03 Fascinating.
00:03:04 And so they were like, all the stuff was sort of, they gave us the stuff and were like, take this, take this,
00:03:09 you got to give it back to the other people, take this and go.
00:03:12 And I'm like, yeah, cool, whatever.
00:03:14 That was it.
00:03:16 Were you one of the offending intruders or were you part of the core group?
00:03:20 No, I was just a friend of a friend of a friend.
00:03:23 Okay, okay.
00:03:24 And I don't know.
00:03:26 Like, Kazzy and Munchie, their stuff was in the room.
00:03:30 They were just like, here, you know, it's fine.
00:03:32 We had like a mutual friend who was like, she wasn't mad at us.
00:03:35 She was just like, hey, I'm sorry.
00:03:36 You guys, could you just, you know, like these guys are like these other people, they're having a fucking attack.
00:03:41 They're having a fucking episode over here.
00:03:43 Here, I'm sorry, just here's your stuff.
00:03:44 So we had to take all our stuff.
00:03:46 Anyway, we had to leave the convention early.
00:03:48 But I did get, I just, I got to the convention and I just walked in the front door and I asked someone,
00:03:53 I'm like, hey, where's the con?
00:03:54 And he's like, oh, you're going to want to go to a registration.
00:03:57 You're going to go on a ticket.
00:03:59 It's right, it's right through there.
00:04:00 And I'm like, thanks.
00:04:01 Had an exactly the opposite direction.
00:04:03 Just walked directly into the main hall with no tag.
00:04:06 Find them, sit down, watch the end of the furry dance competition.
00:04:10 No ticket required.
00:04:12 Paying for things is for losers.
00:04:14 Well done.
00:04:15 I've always wanted to do that.
00:04:18 Like every year, I mean, aside from the fact that a lot of the cons I go to, I get into for free anyways.
00:04:25 But like, anytime I see a con where it's like the security's not that tight, I'm just like, did I fuck?
00:04:31 Am I a Rube?
00:04:32 Like, should I?
00:04:33 I mean, just for example.
00:04:34 They might have checked my tag, not to go in at all, but to go into the hall where the dance competition was taken.
00:04:40 That's what I was going to say.
00:04:41 They probably would have checked it if I'd gone in at the beginning, but like, it was almost ending anyway.
00:04:46 So I think they just didn't care anymore.
00:04:47 They didn't even, they didn't even ask me.
00:04:48 At Bronycon, the only time you were checked is if you went into like the dealer's hall or I think like any of the main events,
00:04:53 you could 100% wander around and get 90% of the experience.
00:04:56 I've been, it's been that way at a few of the smaller cons I've been to.
00:04:59 And yeah, particularly at Bronycon, I remember it being like, what the fuck?
00:05:03 Like there is no reason anyone should have paid for this convention.
00:05:06 Like the only time they check you is if you go into the main events hall, which none of us did.
00:05:11 So.
00:05:12 I mean, I don't even think that's, is that even frowned upon to do?
00:05:15 I feel like it's almost supposed to be that way to attract lookie-loos to, I don't know, make the event seem more...
00:05:21 Yeah, like anime, anime New England is like that too.
00:05:24 Most conventions they go to, getting into the convention grounds is not hard and does not cost money.
00:05:30 It's, they only check your tag for events and for panels and for the vendors hall and stuff like that.
00:05:35 So for any of you, any of you thrifty would-be con-goers, just consider not buying a ticket.
00:05:40 Well, make sure you know how the con works.
00:05:43 Because there are plenty of cons that do check you at the entrance.
00:05:47 If you're gonna con the con, do your research.
00:05:50 That's fair.
00:05:52 I went right into the main event.
00:05:55 I watched the last like three dancers, including the one who ended up winning.
00:05:59 So I guess I've seen the best dancing that Anthony New England has to offer.
00:06:03 I only, I enjoyed the finest, the finest things in life.
00:06:07 What does a fursuit dance look like?
00:06:10 It's pretty tame, honestly, because like, there's not-
00:06:13 Tame like an animal?
00:06:16 I mean, they can't get, I think they can't get too extreme with it.
00:06:19 Because they'll fucking puss out.
00:06:21 Because their suit will fucking explode, yeah.
00:06:23 Right. I wasn't sure if you meant can't get too extreme, like, they can't do jabberwocky fucking dance maneuvers?
00:06:30 Or like, is it a raunchy dance? Like, is it a pole dance?
00:06:34 No, nothing. And there was nothing raunchy about it.
00:06:37 It was just, there wasn't even any cool like break dance spins.
00:06:40 It was just like, I don't know, it was just-
00:06:43 Being in a fursuit would make break dancing easy on your back, at least.
00:06:48 You just wouldn't be able to slide around, people kick you.
00:06:51 Your friction would be so, you could spin on the ground so much.
00:06:55 Anybody, I mean, I've heard of the like advanced nanotech like water cooling fursuits that they're rolling out.
00:07:01 They're really pioneering like the battle armor technology, the fursuit community.
00:07:06 I'm looking forward to it. Keep it up guys.
00:07:08 Incidentally, Kazzy's fursuit looks like Barney the Dinosaur got fused with Super Eye Patch Wolf's avatar.
00:07:18 I've been seeing her make it for like months, like every time she would come over to my house, she would have like a paw.
00:07:25 And she'd be like, yeah, I was sewing it on the bus. Old women commented on it.
00:07:30 I've seen it come together piece by piece.
00:07:33 This is like actually pro.
00:07:35 Is it supposed to be like a, like what animal is-
00:07:39 It is a fur dragon.
00:07:41 Okay, so it is just like a dragon with a wolf's head and paws basically, right?
00:07:48 It's a dragon.
00:07:50 It's a furry.
00:07:52 It does have kind of a somewhat canine snout there.
00:07:56 Yeah, but it's a dragon with paws and fur.
00:08:00 Pretty dope.
00:08:01 That's it.
00:08:02 Congrats to all involved.
00:08:04 Looks like a triumph.
00:08:06 Seems like a triumph.
00:08:08 I think she's going to start selling them.
00:08:10 I think she's going to start doing this like for money.
00:08:12 Damn.
00:08:13 I mean, it looks like it's quality work.
00:08:15 Yeah, you got the skill.
00:08:17 I think this suit is probably like between like 500 plus hours work.
00:08:22 Oh my God.
00:08:24 Yeah.
00:08:25 Remember, what is it? Violent J's daughter received a shitty cosplay costume from some shitty seller.
00:08:32 Next time, look up Kazzy.
00:08:34 Kazzy will do right, but she'll look it up.
00:08:36 Yes.
00:08:38 So, anything else go on there?
00:08:42 Anything else?
00:08:43 I didn't spend that.
00:08:44 I was supposed to go-
00:08:46 Okay, this segues into-
00:08:48 I was supposed to go to it at noon.
00:08:51 I was supposed to get there in the middle of the day, but I overslept.
00:08:53 I slept through my alarm because the previous night I had heard such disturbing news that I could not get to sleep
00:08:59 and I was not able to sleep and I slept through my alarm because of it.
00:09:02 I learned that due to some kind of clerical error or something, I'm not going to be able to vote in the fucking primaries on Super Tuesday.
00:09:11 I fucking registered.
00:09:13 I fucking registered before the deadline.
00:09:16 I went on the 31st.
00:09:17 I checked the box.
00:09:19 I should be registered.
00:09:20 I'm calling the registrar tomorrow.
00:09:22 They're going to get a piece of my mind.
00:09:24 This is bullshit.
00:09:25 This is voter suppression.
00:09:27 This is not democracy.
00:09:29 I'm white.
00:09:30 I'm supposed to be able to vote in these things.
00:09:32 God damn it.
00:09:33 Did you try turning it off and on again?
00:09:35 Maybe.
00:09:38 Yeah, turn the DNC off and on again.
00:09:40 It'll work.
00:09:41 Sir, is it plugged in?
00:09:42 Is your vote plugged in?
00:09:43 I don't know.
00:09:44 Whatever.
00:09:45 I'm going to call the registrar.
00:09:46 That's fucked up, man.
00:09:47 It is.
00:09:48 I did everything right.
00:09:49 I did everything right, but it's still-
00:09:50 I would have assumed you would do everything wrong, but no.
00:09:53 I thought so too.
00:09:55 I saw it.
00:09:56 I checked my status, and it's not registered.
00:09:58 I'm like, oh god, I fucked up.
00:10:00 I fucked up.
00:10:01 I let it go by.
00:10:02 I wasn't paying attention.
00:10:03 I missed the deadline, but then I remembered, no.
00:10:05 I was at the RMV weeks ago, and I filled out the form.
00:10:09 I should be registered.
00:10:11 I registered.
00:10:12 What is this?
00:10:13 What am I looking at?
00:10:14 I did not fuck up.
00:10:16 Is there any hope of remedying this, do you think?
00:10:19 I don't know.
00:10:20 I'm going to call the registrar, and I have no idea what he will say about it.
00:10:24 What is the RMV?
00:10:26 It's the Massachusetts form of the DMV.
00:10:28 It's the Registry of Motor Vehicles as opposed to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
00:10:31 We have a BMV in Ohio.
00:10:33 That's the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
00:10:35 I didn't know all this.
00:10:37 All over the spectrum, everybody has different ideas.
00:10:39 We have a BMV, the Building of Motion Vehicle.
00:10:43 So I might be cocked out of voting on Super Tuesday, which makes me very sad, very upset,
00:10:52 very frustrated.
00:10:53 But it's okay.
00:10:54 Is Super Tuesday this Tuesday?
00:10:56 It is a week from this Tuesday.
00:10:58 It's March 3rd.
00:10:59 So it'll be the next Tuesday after you, the listener, are hearing this.
00:11:05 But it's okay.
00:11:06 But it's okay because Bernie fucking blew out Nevada.
00:11:10 Bernie obliterated Nevada.
00:11:12 He did.
00:11:13 That snake warren, not even viable.
00:11:16 Not even a single fucking delegate.
00:11:20 Pete Buttigieg scrabbles with his little rat hands just barely over the precipice of viability.
00:11:25 He'll probably get like one and a half delegates.
00:11:27 Biden will get a handful.
00:11:29 He came in.
00:11:30 But Bernie fucking blew it out and got almost half.
00:11:33 He almost got more than everyone else combined.
00:11:36 Ben, did you watch Pete's speech he did after Bernie won Nevada?
00:11:41 I didn't watch the speech, but I saw the tweet.
00:11:43 It was pretty funny.
00:11:45 He was like, congratulations to Bernie.
00:11:48 I'm glad that we agree on so many things he did so well.
00:11:51 I will now proceed to shit on Bernie and tell you how bad he is for the next 20 minutes.
00:11:56 Everyone is just, oh, Pete and Warren, they're all just like, oh, Bernie's so mean.
00:12:03 He yells so much, though.
00:12:05 Like, what a nasty man.
00:12:07 I wouldn't hang that man in my kitchen.
00:12:10 I find it off-putting.
00:12:12 It's a big cope.
00:12:14 Did you see Chris Matthews on NBC?
00:12:18 He compared it to the Nazis.
00:12:20 He compared Bernie blowing out Nevada to the Nazis.
00:12:25 The Nazis blew out the Jews?
00:12:27 The Nazis are conquering France by running over the Maginot Line.
00:12:31 Odd comparison, but okay.
00:12:33 In slightly bad taste, considering Bernie's family was killed in the Holocaust.
00:12:39 Yeah, but that's true of like every Askenazi Jew.
00:12:41 So, I mean, what are we going to do?
00:12:43 We're all day worried about this.
00:12:45 What are we going to never compare Jewish people to Nazis?
00:12:48 I mean, come on.
00:12:51 Once in a while. They build a hell of an Autobahn out there.
00:12:54 There was just a recent struggle tweet about that where a guy was like, he said,
00:13:01 it's like the Holocaust, both parties fault.
00:13:03 The Nazis for killing Jews, the Jews for being Jews.
00:13:07 Wait, yeah, who tweeted that?
00:13:09 I remember that.
00:13:10 Oh, shit.
00:13:11 It seemed like a joke, but then I wasn't sure.
00:13:13 Damn.
00:13:14 Was it like Richard Dawkins or something?
00:13:16 It was. It was somebody who would say that, I believe.
00:13:19 Yeah.
00:13:20 Yeah.
00:13:21 Richard Dawkins isn't like woke on the JQ.
00:13:24 That can't be right, is it?
00:13:26 Well, what he is is a liberal.
00:13:29 And liberals are stupid because liberals, this is what we're seeing.
00:13:33 This is what we're seeing with the mainstream media melting down right now.
00:13:36 Liberals like fascists more than they like socialists.
00:13:39 This is what's had.
00:13:40 They're going to have to fucking learn to deal with it.
00:13:42 People like fascists more than they like socialists.
00:13:44 People do like order.
00:13:45 Sure.
00:13:46 Did you like order?
00:13:47 Well, so, yep, they sure do.
00:13:49 They love it and they're going to cry.
00:13:51 I'm going to drink their tears.
00:13:53 Listen, I know I'm not supposed to say this, but yes, in my heart of hearts,
00:13:57 I do want to see heads on spikes.
00:13:59 Yes, I am the toxic Bernie bro your parents warned you about.
00:14:02 I am one of the bad ones.
00:14:04 That's no secret.
00:14:05 I'm owning it.
00:14:07 Okay.
00:14:08 That's good to know.
00:14:10 But they're not all like me.
00:14:11 Okay.
00:14:12 I'm I'm the bad one.
00:14:13 Okay.
00:14:14 Okay.
00:14:15 It wasn't Richard Dawkins who said I knew it.
00:14:17 I knew it.
00:14:18 Both sides to blame.
00:14:19 This has to be a joke.
00:14:20 Let's have a little bit of charity here.
00:14:22 It has to be.
00:14:23 Let me I don't.
00:14:24 I mean, is it like a parody account?
00:14:27 But he's made some pretty fucking.
00:14:29 He's made some like recently he unironically tweeted about how eugenics.
00:14:33 You might not like it, but you can't deny it works.
00:14:36 Okay.
00:14:37 Come on.
00:14:38 That was taken way out of context because his point was like, yes, of course, you can
00:14:41 manipulate the genes of a population if you choose to, but morally, obviously you don't
00:14:45 want to.
00:14:46 But you know, you could if you wanted to just don't do it.
00:14:49 Which is true.
00:14:50 Yes, it's true.
00:14:52 But why would you say it like that?
00:14:54 Why would you say it works?
00:14:55 I don't know.
00:14:56 Every there's no like nobody contends that you cannot manipulate a genome through selective
00:15:01 breeding.
00:15:02 Nobody needed that pointed out to them.
00:15:05 As always.
00:15:06 Okay.
00:15:07 Were you in the none of us were in the fucking conversation he was responding to and we're
00:15:11 just taking the thing.
00:15:12 Let me look.
00:15:13 I'm going to look right now.
00:15:14 I'm going to look up the content.
00:15:16 There are just so many stupid people on Twitter that you probably would have to spell out
00:15:19 something like that if you like start talking with all the dregs, you know.
00:15:24 I don't really know anything about Richard Dawkins.
00:15:27 Other than I've heard his face.
00:15:29 Richard Dawkins.
00:15:30 His name.
00:15:31 Richard Dawkins.
00:15:32 I believe in God.
00:15:33 A relevant writer who a decade and a half, who a couple decades ago was pretty big because
00:15:38 he wrote some books about how atheism is kind of cool actually.
00:15:41 The God of delusion was him.
00:15:43 The God of delusion.
00:15:44 Yes.
00:15:45 I've heard all of that.
00:15:48 He was one of the four horsemen with Sam Harris and the other guys.
00:15:52 In any case, I mean the thing you're referring to Ben with him talking about eugenics, he
00:15:55 does in his follow up tweet say, I deplore the idea of a eugenic policy.
00:16:01 I simply said deploring it doesn't mean it wouldn't work.
00:16:04 Is it a dog whistle, Ben?
00:16:06 Does he actually support it?
00:16:07 Work to do what?
00:16:08 Is this his position?
00:16:09 Work to do what?
00:16:11 To eugenicize humanity?
00:16:13 How much more clear can he be?
00:16:15 Obviously it would work.
00:16:17 I'm just saying, look, I'm not saying Richard, I didn't say Richard Dawkins made these tweets
00:16:22 to unironically promote.
00:16:25 It's just a weird thing to say.
00:16:27 And here's another.
00:16:28 This Jew thing is even weirder.
00:16:31 I don't know.
00:16:33 That's all I have to say about it.
00:16:37 Bernie Rondavada, Deb.
00:16:39 It's going to be okay, America.
00:16:41 Okay.
00:16:42 No, it's not.
00:16:43 You think the DNC is going to fuck him?
00:16:46 What?
00:16:47 Hey, what's the position of Steve?
00:16:48 You think the DNC is going to fuck him out?
00:16:49 They have super delegates, don't they?
00:16:50 I don't really still have the chance.
00:16:51 They have super delegates, but they do not come into the vote until after the first
00:16:56 until after all the pledge delegates.
00:16:59 So if he were to win a majority, or anyone were to win a majority of regular delegates,
00:17:05 the super delegates would not be allowed to vote.
00:17:08 Okay, I see.
00:17:09 Oh, do you know about like on the last debate, the last question, they asked everyone like
00:17:16 should the person who gets, even if there's no majority, should the person who gets the
00:17:21 plurality of delegates be made the nominee?
00:17:24 And everyone but Bernie said no because they don't believe in democracy and their shitlibs
00:17:29 and they have no values.
00:17:30 Hmm, I did see that.
00:17:32 Okay, I see your point.
00:17:34 Although to be fair, if Bernie has a plurality but not a majority, can it really necessarily
00:17:40 be said that he like, you know, is in fact the winner?
00:17:44 Shouldn't they pair things down and decide?
00:17:46 Because that's not like the 51% has decided that they won.
00:17:50 Pair things down to who?
00:17:52 Well, you know, like to do like that, it's not first past the post, but that voting system
00:17:56 where the weakest candidates are limited.
00:17:58 Like democracy isn't just there's one thing, there's one way of doing it specifically,
00:18:03 and we know that's real democracy and every other voting system is bad.
00:18:07 There are different ways to do it, including the like the CGP gray model of like everybody
00:18:12 wants if there is no majority.
00:18:14 Yes, that's fine and all, but like that has no relevance at all to the super delegates
00:18:20 and the convention.
00:18:21 There is no alternative vote.
00:18:23 It is, yeah, the super delegates just are a secondary block of unpledged voters who
00:18:28 just get to vote whoever the fuck they want.
00:18:30 I don't want that.
00:18:31 That should go away.
00:18:32 I don't know why that exists.
00:18:33 That seems wrong and not good.
00:18:35 You know who else thinks that that's bad and shouldn't exist?
00:18:37 Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, who all said that it was bad and undemocratic
00:18:41 until suddenly it was their only chance at the nomination and now they all support it.
00:18:45 Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, don't you understand once they have power, they will make things good.
00:18:49 You just need to trust them.
00:18:50 Yes, that's true.
00:18:51 This is what you don't understand, Ben.
00:18:52 You have to trust them.
00:18:53 They know what's best for you.
00:18:54 I do.
00:18:55 I do trust them.
00:18:56 They are standing out with a podium.
00:18:58 I mean, I'm not standing up with a podium.
00:19:00 I'm on team P now.
00:19:01 So, better listen.
00:19:02 Warren's the immoral after a plant position of power becomes moral once you are in power.
00:19:08 I love it.
00:19:09 It's fantastic.
00:19:10 That's my plan too.
00:19:11 You can't argue with it.
00:19:12 Or you go to the fucking vote room.
00:19:15 Anyway, it's all very upsetting.
00:19:18 Anyway, the point being that, yeah, if Bernie doesn't get the majority, it's possible the
00:19:23 super delegates will screw him out of it.
00:19:25 They'll come in and they'll be like, uh, we're actually all going to vote for Bloomberg, so
00:19:28 he gets the nomination instead because he paid us too.
00:19:31 I'm ready for the Bloomberg.
00:19:33 I'm ready.
00:19:34 I'm ready to...
00:19:35 I'm ready to hashtag vote bloom no matter whom.
00:19:38 That's...
00:19:39 No matter whom he is, if he changes himself.
00:19:45 The delegates are going to vote bloom no matter whom.
00:19:48 So Bernie changes his last name to Bloomberg.
00:19:51 He gets all the votes instead.
00:19:54 Oh, sneaky.
00:19:55 But I don't know.
00:19:58 There's a possibility that it might not come to that.
00:20:00 Bernie might end up with a majority.
00:20:02 We don't know.
00:20:03 He's going to start winnowing.
00:20:06 Elizabeth Warren needs to drop out soon.
00:20:08 Pete Klobuchar, even I would say Biden at this.
00:20:12 Honestly, nobody else even has a chance.
00:20:15 Just get them all out of here.
00:20:17 Just get them out of the country.
00:20:19 Leave them out.
00:20:20 Just throw them into the ocean.
00:20:21 I don't know if I want the field to narrow down for Bernie to soak up more support, or
00:20:26 if I like that the center's vote is split between all these fucking nobodies.
00:20:29 That's the question, isn't it?
00:20:30 That's the X factor.
00:20:31 I'm not sure.
00:20:32 Did I mention...
00:20:33 I realized that I didn't mention...
00:20:37 Before New Hampshire, I was making calls.
00:20:39 Did I say that I was making calls for Bernie on the PCK?
00:20:41 You mentioned it at some point.
00:20:42 Yeah.
00:20:43 Okay.
00:20:44 All right.
00:20:45 Yeah.
00:20:46 I was fucking in there.
00:20:47 I was in there because I was really worried about New Hampshire, and it turns out I had
00:20:49 every one...
00:20:50 $1,000 to our next Kickstarter to get a personal Bernie Sanders endorsement phone call from
00:20:54 Ben St. who will convince you to vote for Bernie.
00:20:56 Yeah.
00:20:57 That's what my reward is.
00:20:58 I will convince you to vote for Bernie Sanders, no matter what.
00:21:04 We'll be here all day.
00:21:05 We'll go over all the facts and logic until...
00:21:07 Oh, boy.
00:21:08 Do I have anything else to say about...
00:21:11 Do I have anything else to say about that whole charade?
00:21:13 I don't know.
00:21:14 South Carolina's coming up.
00:21:16 Biden might win South Carolina, but the gap is narrowing.
00:21:19 Bernie might actually be ahead by the time they do the poll.
00:21:21 I don't know.
00:21:22 Open quit.
00:21:23 If Biden doesn't win South Carolina, he needs to fucking drop out.
00:21:26 He is dead in the water if he doesn't win South Carolina.
00:21:29 He's probably dead in the water anyway, to be perfectly...
00:21:32 Yon!
00:21:33 You bore us, Ben.
00:21:34 Yes, yes.
00:21:35 Collectively.
00:21:36 All right.
00:21:37 Let's do something else.
00:21:38 I've said all I have to say.
00:21:40 I'm not following it.
00:21:41 I have nothing to add to this.
00:21:43 It's fine.
00:21:44 Here's the thing.
00:21:45 I'm following it, and I have nothing to add to it.
00:21:48 Fair enough.
00:21:49 I'm really excited for the debate on Tuesday.
00:21:53 Join my discord where every time there's a debate, we all get in the discord and are
00:22:01 like, oh my god.
00:22:02 Did you guys watch the debate?
00:22:04 I only saw a little bit of bloom getting up.
00:22:06 This last debate was unbelievable.
00:22:09 It was by far the funnest debate.
00:22:11 There's a part where Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar are literally just screaming at each other,
00:22:17 and the moderator cannot quiet them down.
00:22:20 They just keep going.
00:22:22 That happened a couple of times.
00:22:24 Klobuchar's barely contained rage is palpable.
00:22:28 It's so uncomfortable.
00:22:30 Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
00:22:32 Considering that she probably views him as an upstart guy, she's like, how is this fucking
00:22:37 guy questioning me?
00:22:38 Well, it was about a thing in a recent interview.
00:22:41 She was not able to name the president of Mexico.
00:22:44 Oh, right.
00:22:45 The people, the moderators asked her about it, and she was like, you're right.
00:22:51 I hate Mexicans.
00:22:52 I don't view them as human beings.
00:22:53 You got me.
00:22:54 You want to understand my position.
00:22:55 She's like, it was just a slip of the tongue, and Pete Buttigieg, fucking psychopath, is
00:23:01 like, I don't believe that that's true.
00:23:04 I don't believe like, are you, like, how can we trust someone who would forget something
00:23:07 so important?
00:23:08 And she gets fucking like really defensive.
00:23:11 She gets, she's like, I'm sorry, we're not all as perfect as you, Mayor Pete.
00:23:15 Are you calling me stupid?
00:23:16 Are you saying I'm dumb?
00:23:19 And he basically just goes on and says yes.
00:23:22 I think I speak for a large portion of our audience when I say I couldn't give less of
00:23:26 a fuck about anything in the world possibly.
00:23:30 So fair point.
00:23:32 I was fucking on the edge of my seat.
00:23:34 I was on the edge of my seat.
00:23:36 I was edging on my seat.
00:23:37 I was edging the whole time.
00:23:40 And then at the end, last thing, and then at the end when Bernie just does literal fucking
00:23:44 Marxism to Bloomberg, that was when I had the coom.
00:23:47 That's when they're like, do you deserve to be a billionaire, Bloomberg?
00:23:50 And he's like, yes, I worked very hard for it.
00:23:53 And Bernie's like, don't you think your workers are the ones responsible for that fortune?
00:24:00 Don't you think they deserve some of the credit for it?
00:24:02 Just literal fucking Marxism, literal class consciousness.
00:24:06 Bernie's a hero.
00:24:07 He's my hero.
00:24:08 I mean, Bernie's a millionaire though.
00:24:10 You're such a fucking moron, Nate.
00:24:12 Your IQ is fridge temperature level.
00:24:14 Let's go on with that, Ben.
00:24:16 Yeah.
00:24:17 With you being ironic, I can never tell.
00:24:19 Who knows?
00:24:20 Who knows?
00:24:21 Okay.
00:24:22 Yeah.
00:24:23 A great point.
00:24:24 A great stupid point, also made by fellow stupid low IQ moron, Michael Bloomberg, on the debate
00:24:31 stage, which is why he's basically out of the running at this point.
00:24:34 Good job.
00:24:35 Let's move on.
00:24:36 A fellow bloomer.
00:24:38 How exciting for all of us.
00:24:40 Finally, we'll get the bloomer representation, the most oppressed minority in the White House,
00:24:44 looking forward to it.
00:24:45 We need more.
00:24:46 We're all about to bloom.
00:24:47 We need more voter suppression.
00:24:48 When you think about it, who is a bigger minority than billionaires?
00:24:51 Just saying.
00:24:52 It's true.
00:24:53 Right.
00:24:54 Just saying.
00:24:55 It's true.
00:24:56 They're guillotines way more often than non-billionaires are.
00:24:59 You should join the guillotine, Ben, when the guillotine, when they are rolling out through
00:25:04 the streets.
00:25:05 I will be the first one.
00:25:06 I will be the first one out there.
00:25:09 And I'll probably be the first one that they turn on.
00:25:11 I've had enough of this crap.
00:25:13 Yes.
00:25:14 I said let's move on.
00:25:15 I am talking about the artistic creative process because I'm having art problems, artist boy
00:25:26 problems, anxiety about things I do, always being not good enough, no matter what it is.
00:25:33 Tell me about it, bro.
00:25:35 You can take-
00:25:36 Sounds like our democratic process.
00:25:38 You can take any multitude of potential reasons.
00:25:45 I felt bad about this because I didn't use a reference and you're supposed to do that.
00:25:50 Or I did use a reference and I felt like I was cheating.
00:25:53 I used something and it didn't work out the way I wanted it.
00:25:56 Any potential reason for upset with the art.
00:26:01 And the core reason is always the same.
00:26:04 And it's just that I'm afraid of death and everything that I'm doing with regards to art,
00:26:12 when I'm trying to get good, when I'm trying to improve the quality of what I can draw,
00:26:16 what I can create, what's going through my head is this feeling of every moment I do something,
00:26:24 it has to be working towards being good because I only have a limited amount of time on this
00:26:28 earth and I'm going to die if I don't do it fast enough.
00:26:30 I need to be efficient.
00:26:31 I need to be making the most of the time I have.
00:26:35 And as that's going through my head and I'm drawing something and it's not perfect,
00:26:38 I'm thinking, okay, what could I be doing wrong?
00:26:41 And I'm thinking of all the tutorials that I didn't fully watch or the things I could have been doing,
00:26:46 the techniques that people have told me about and I've kind of forgotten how to do.
00:26:50 And I'm like, oh shit, my knowledge banks are too low.
00:26:54 I don't have the capability to be efficient.
00:26:57 It's a lost cause.
00:26:59 I'm a lost cause.
00:27:00 This drawing, which admittedly is fine, is terrible and I've wasted my life and I'm a worst person ever.
00:27:08 And it's all downed to the whole death thing.
00:27:13 And I'm trying to figure out how to not be scared of death.
00:27:15 That's my goal.
00:27:16 I'll tell you.
00:27:17 Tell me if you want to.
00:27:19 Well, I can help to some degree because you just got to think about the fact that death will come
00:27:27 suddenly and there's no way to predict it.
00:27:30 Oh, that makes me feel so much better.
00:27:32 Thank you.
00:27:33 Well, there's no point.
00:27:34 We're in.
00:27:35 Right.
00:27:36 That's kind of the way I look at it.
00:27:37 It's like, I don't see much point in considering it because it's like, well, I know that if it happens,
00:27:44 it's going to happen suddenly or it'll be obvious long before it happens.
00:27:50 I fear death a lot, but I fear disability significantly more.
00:27:55 That's my...
00:27:56 Well, it's not literally just about death.
00:27:58 It's that death is the cause of my artistic anxiety.
00:28:01 Like the reason I hate myself through my art is because I'm scared that I'm not getting
00:28:06 fast enough, good enough.
00:28:08 Right.
00:28:09 I think like, for me, it's kind of like, I understand that fear in the sense of like,
00:28:14 oh, I don't want to, you know, what if I don't get good enough before I die?
00:28:19 But it's like, you won't.
00:28:21 You won't get good enough before you die.
00:28:23 It's just not going to happen.
00:28:25 Like you'll never, because there's no ceiling on it.
00:28:28 You'll always want to get better.
00:28:30 At no point will you look at your stuff and be like, okay, now I can die happy, you know?
00:28:35 True.
00:28:36 I do feel like though there are like very obvious milestones and I am currently in the
00:28:41 mediocre artist point where I can't easily sketch something that looks okay.
00:28:47 I need to spend a long time on anything.
00:28:50 I mean, like, if you...
00:28:51 I mean, all artists spend a long time on things.
00:28:53 I know that, but like, you see how like someone who has a very good grasp of, you know, drawing
00:28:59 can, you know, sketch a little cartoon character, a little doodle.
00:29:03 And it can be like clearly, you know, if you put lines on the line art on that, that would
00:29:09 be a great drawing.
00:29:10 And they didn't think about it too much.
00:29:12 It's sort of on autopilot.
00:29:14 I maybe wouldn't realize when I hit that point, which is the reason like you would always
00:29:19 be aiming higher and higher until you're dead.
00:29:22 But I know of certain things that I need to improve about my drawing.
00:29:28 And once I feel like I've conquered them or like I can conquer them in individual drawings
00:29:33 without tearing my hair out, I will know that I have gotten to a good point.
00:29:37 I think it's a good idea to just, you know, I mean, obviously practicing all the time.
00:29:43 But like specifically just like doing as much different stuff as possible because I feel
00:29:50 like the best way to get through, like to make breakthroughs in any kind of art is to
00:29:57 stop trying to force the thing that you're trying to do and just go do something else
00:30:03 and come back later and see if you've figured it out by then, you know, because like you
00:30:07 never know where the answer that's going to unblock your understanding might come from.
00:30:12 It's like maybe you're like, oh, why can't I get these colors right, you know, and then
00:30:17 you go and draw a bunch of other shit and then while you're working on something else,
00:30:21 you're like, oh, this color, this is the one I needed for that other drawing I was trying to do,
00:30:25 you know, just like maybe it's just a good idea to, you know, if you hit something,
00:30:30 you're not sure how to fix this problem you have, just go do something else.
00:30:34 Well, here's the thing. I'm aware of like certain practices and tutorials, things I can go to
00:30:41 for like information on how to do specific things. It's not a specific thing necessarily
00:30:47 that I'm having trouble figuring out what it is. It's more of a getting past that initial
00:30:56 like death spiral way of thinking. As soon as you start a drawing, you open up the program,
00:31:03 you're looking at it and you draw the first little bit and you're like, oh no, this isn't
00:31:06 going to work and that stops you. I don't let that happen to me. I try to just power through
00:31:12 the whole thing as fast as possible. Sometimes I'm not thinking and that's the thing that always
00:31:18 seems to work is that when I'm not thinking about getting better, I draw and therefore get better
00:31:23 and I really want to know how to stop thinking. I need some sort of way to make myself an idiot
00:31:28 while I do this stuff. I was thinking, hmm, let's just drink profusely, but I'm not sure
00:31:33 that's a really good idea. That doesn't seem like the best solution. Just get into marijuana.
00:31:38 It's worked for me so well. I mean, it's not legal in the UK and I really don't want to talk to teenagers.
00:31:44 It's not legal where I am either, but... There's a guy I know. This is in no way a solution to your
00:31:51 problem, but what it is is another example of a guy I'm currently mystified by the insane amount
00:31:56 of talent that this person has. Do you guys know who Mark Rebele is? Or Rebele? Nope.
00:32:02 Does this sound familiar to anybody? Okay, Mark Rebele. I've never actually heard the name pronounced out loud.
00:32:07 I've just seen it on YouTube and stuff. So he's a musician and what he does is he has made a career.
00:32:12 He quit his job a while back and has gone pro like doing sets where he will set in coffee shops
00:32:20 and restaurants and on stage. He's getting more and more popular these days where he will set up his
00:32:25 keyboard and he will have zero set list and he will go up and he will improv, but he used loops
00:32:30 and samplers and stuff to capture his own voice and to in real time mix full on songs that he 100%
00:32:36 improvs based on audience submission and stuff. So okay, here's a link to, in my opinion, the
00:32:42 greatest work of art of the 21st century, which is a song called Work That As For Daddy.
00:32:47 Yeah, this song. It's an eight minute long, jazzy breakdown song just built around the
00:32:54 concept of Big Booty Black Girl. That's it. And he just makes up all the lyrics based on that.
00:33:00 And it is an absolute journey to go on. And I've watched this so many times, once I love the song,
00:33:05 and two, because I know that like, okay, he has to have like his keyboard, his sampler, he has to know music
00:33:11 and how to loop things correctly. But I'm so in awe of all the skills that went into in real time.
00:33:18 He did this on a live stream one time. This is literally what I want my life to be.
00:33:22 It is so amazing. He's bought all the equipment that I dream of having.
00:33:28 And he's just rapping, he's just literally saying, yo, give me that ass, give me that fucking booty.
00:33:33 And he looks like Anthony Fantano when he was 18.
00:33:35 I'm sucking your booty and ass in the same place. Whatever the fuck it was.
00:33:39 Oh, I'm sucking your pussy and ass in the same place. Gotta work that ass for daddy.
00:33:44 And he looks like a Anthony Fantano who's in shape with hair. It's nuts. He looks like a pedophile and it's great.
00:33:51 He's a monster, but I love him. And I'm just in awe of this.
00:33:55 And as a guy who has just dabbled a little bit into music and music composition here and there, total, total amateur shit.
00:34:02 Like, I've talked about this before. It's like this man's casting a fucking magical spell.
00:34:07 He knows the Harry Potter runes and glyphs to just do magic in front of me. And I don't get it at all.
00:34:12 It's funny that you're so impressed with it just because I do get it. I get like how this, how you do this.
00:34:19 I mean, okay, answer this question. I've had one question about this.
00:34:22 The hardest thing about this to me seems how to get the loops to sync up perfectly in real time.
00:34:28 You gotta press the button at the right exact second, you know?
00:34:31 That seems so hard to do that consistently.
00:34:34 It's the same as playing notes on the beat consistently.
00:34:39 But that's hard, though. It's kind of the most basic skill you need to have.
00:34:45 If you can tap your feet to a beat, you can eventually, you know, transfer that skill into doing something.
00:34:51 And the fact of the matter is, there is some, you know, margin of error allowance.
00:34:55 Like, I'm thinking about, like, times I've seen live bands where they have to, like, Agiloch,
00:35:02 which I know, Hippo, you listened to, like, the whole Agiloch discography the other day, right?
00:35:06 Oh, yeah, yeah. The, uh...
00:35:08 Yeah, what'd you think about that?
00:35:11 I liked it. There was a lot of, like, the deep, screamy...
00:35:14 Well, not a lot, actually. There's just bits of it.
00:35:17 But, yeah, it was very moody and very cool.
00:35:20 Good background music for working.
00:35:23 Yeah. When I saw Agiloch live, because they switch back and forth between a, like, unplugged-and-plugged-in sound,
00:35:30 in order to, you know, switch between guitar tonalities, they have to, like, press a switch with their, you know,
00:35:36 like, the kick down on a little switch.
00:35:38 But there's often moments in the songs where it, like, dramatically transitions between, like, acoustic and electric.
00:35:44 So you have to hit that thing on the floor just at the right time to...
00:35:49 You know, and you can see that it's, it definitely seems like a bit of a struggle to remember to do it at the right time.
00:35:56 I definitely had trouble with guitar pedals and stuff.
00:36:00 I never seem to... I mean, it was years ago that I've been using guitar pedals and, like,
00:36:05 when I used to be in, like, a school band playing, like, little rock things.
00:36:09 And you're doing the thing with your hands, and then you go to, like, okay, lift, like, your foot up and land on something.
00:36:17 Anything involving your feet, like, what this guy is doing in this video is, it's funny.
00:36:24 This is exactly... When I said, like, this is what I want to do, I'm not exaggerating.
00:36:28 I literally want this equipment because I have a habit of banging on desks, like, making desk beats and stuff
00:36:35 just out of not being able to sit still.
00:36:38 And, like, those pads, the synth pads, like, what he's got there that he's doing his beats on,
00:36:45 ever since I saw the Kanye West video for Runaway where he's playing the beat pad to the Phoenix,
00:36:53 I was like, oh, I don't have to learn how to play drums.
00:36:56 Drumming is so hard. Like, to me, this looks easy.
00:37:00 Drumming where you have to time your hands and legs together is nearly impossible.
00:37:05 I cannot coordinate my hands and feet.
00:37:07 But if you just press buttons on a pad with your hands, it's so much easier to control and time your hands.
00:37:13 So, you know, something like this, this seems like a way I actually could perform music that, you know,
00:37:21 would be less difficult than any other method.
00:37:24 Every day, every time I stream, I'm getting more and more of a master.
00:37:27 I'm acquiring these skills via my soundboard, which I would mash right now,
00:37:30 but none of you will hear it in the recording, so I'll do it for myself.
00:37:33 Heh, heh, epic. Bruh, bruh, bruh, bruh.
00:37:36 You know, music has also been one of the things I've been trying to make on, like, a garage band on my iPad.
00:37:48 Just simple beats that, you know, they loop, so I don't need to think about time too much.
00:37:52 And I'm just trying, desperately trying to make something that sounds like it could be on a Gorillaz album,
00:37:58 and then I'm gonna sing over it.
00:38:00 But every time I make, I make the beat, and I'm like,
00:38:04 I think I have a trouble, like, figuring out how to structure the song.
00:38:08 Maybe Digi, you could help with that.
00:38:10 Like, like advice, because I have the beat and it loops,
00:38:13 and then I add a thing, and now it suddenly, there's too many things, and it's too cluttered, so I get rid of it.
00:38:19 I can't figure out how to visualize the entire song before I have something to sing to.
00:38:26 If you're having trouble with too many layers, like too much sound, is that what you mean?
00:38:33 I don't know, I have a few things where they just sound like amateur, doesn't know what he's doing, sort of beats.
00:38:40 I would say that part of what I've learned is that the EQ matters a lot,
00:38:46 in the sense that a beat is usually prepared out of elements that don't exist on the same frequency as your voice.
00:38:54 So think of a rap beat, usually bass and hi-hats are the main focus,
00:38:59 because it's either way super deep or way super high-pitched, but your voice tends to fall into the mid-range.
00:39:05 So as you're customizing a beat, a professional producer would try to create the beat around the singer's range,
00:39:16 try to figure out where do we fit your voice in there,
00:39:20 or make a good singer, of course, will also know to fit their singing to the beat,
00:39:26 but for me, I try to seek out beats that I will sound good on top of.
00:39:31 I more or less know where my voice falls in the range from just looking at my singing through an equalizer.
00:39:39 So I just try to make it so there is space in the beat for that sound frequency that nothing else is on that exact spot.
00:39:47 And granted, I don't do this very often, most of my music just sounds like shit.
00:39:52 It just sounds like a garbled mess, because I can't avoid these problems,
00:39:56 either because I didn't make the beat or whatever else.
00:40:00 But when you're actually making your own, it's very nice to get to go like,
00:40:04 I will sometimes create a beat just by thinking,
00:40:07 alright, let me find a low-pitched noise and a high-pitched noise and something in the middle that doesn't counteract my voice.
00:40:13 And if you have those three things, you're done, essentially.
00:40:16 You just got to arrange them into a song.
00:40:19 I guess I just got to work at it a bit.
00:40:23 It always annoys me. I'm getting close. I have a bass line.
00:40:27 I play that and it loops and it's like, that's pretty good.
00:40:30 I add some drums and it's like, yeah, it's pretty good, but it doesn't feel like a song.
00:40:34 Well, it also helps remember, especially if you're doing a guerrilla style thing,
00:40:38 that most of it is sample-based.
00:40:41 Rather than just making it out of the sounds that are built into the program,
00:40:45 it might help to go and just go find drum sounds that you want to use
00:40:50 or make your own samples or even something like that.
00:40:54 I'm sure that a lot of...
00:40:56 In the case of guerrillas, the album The Fall, I think he literally made that
00:41:00 in a week on his iPad while flying to new places or something.
00:41:03 When I learned that he made it on an iPad, I was like, okay, well, I have an iPad.
00:41:07 Maybe I could try. Maybe he could make something.
00:41:10 It's funny because I used to fuck around in GarageBand way back when I had a Mac,
00:41:15 and that makes that kind of thing a lot easier because it comes with a sample pack.
00:41:20 A lot of those guys, I don't know if Damon Albarn specifically uses GarageBand,
00:41:26 but I will hear the sounds that are pre-packaged with GarageBand in all kinds of music,
00:41:32 especially TV shows.
00:41:34 AudioJungle.com.
00:41:36 Even Yuki Kajiyura, who's my favorite anime soundtrack composer,
00:41:42 I know she uses GarageBand just because some of those loops come up in her songs.
00:41:46 I'm like, ah, there they are. I've played with these myself,
00:41:49 but it's also a little embarrassing when you hear it too much.
00:41:54 I'm watching House Hunters or something, and I'm like, okay, I know all this music is made out of three loops.
00:42:00 The soundtrack was crafted in 30 minutes, and I could have done it myself.
00:42:05 I mean, I don't really mind that it feels...
00:42:08 The thing that I've always had problems with in music is just having songs that have beginnings and endings
00:42:14 and hooks and stuff, like a flow.
00:42:19 I don't really care what I make it with or how it sounds.
00:42:22 All you need is 8 bars of intro, 16 bars for the first verse, 8 bars of chorus, 16 bars for the second verse,
00:42:28 8 bars of chorus, some kind of bridge for 4 to 8 bars, 8 bars of chorus again, 8 bars of outro.
00:42:35 That's every pop song, so...
00:42:37 Okay, there you go.
00:42:39 Write that down, kids.
00:42:41 Yeah, let me actually write that down.
00:42:43 She delivered for you.
00:42:45 Clickety-clack down the track.
00:42:47 And at 130 BPM, that almost always equals a 2-minute song, which is why nowadays,
00:42:53 rap music, you'll notice that there are so many songs that are almost exactly 2 minutes,
00:42:58 and it's just because if you just do that structure I just described at the minimal level,
00:43:03 it will always come out to 2 minutes.
00:43:06 You'll see that on a lot of my albums that I did with Shade,
00:43:09 because he just builds a song to that structure, and it's just like, okay, done.
00:43:14 Is that going to be the Radcon rap?
00:43:18 Is it going to be exactly 2 minutes?
00:43:20 No, it'll probably be much longer, because there's 6 of us on it.
00:43:23 We've got a lot to cover.
00:43:25 There's a lot of garlic to butter, a lot of bread to slice, you know.
00:43:30 Gotcha, gotcha.
00:43:32 Obviously, we're in the middle of the show right now, but what do we want this track to be?
00:43:39 Do we want it to be an epic length of this track, or like a cool, in and out, more of a hit song?
00:43:47 I was thinking, for the purposes of the, you know, it's a story.
00:43:54 The PCP got hacked, and we're dissing Brad Garlic House.
00:43:58 I think it should be a storytelling song, instead of just a fucking view.
00:44:03 I think that the music video should tell the story, if there is one, and the song is just...
00:44:08 Well, I mean, there's one of the same.
00:44:10 You can't really tell a story with a song that isn't telling a story.
00:44:14 I mean, of course you can. Music videos hold the time of stories that aren't in the song.
00:44:18 Usually in the song, maybe you don't pay attention to the lyrics.
00:44:22 Usually the video is like an interpretation of the song on some level, but...
00:44:27 I'm not literally saying, like, let's start with a story time, of course.
00:44:30 Like, once upon a time, the PC... I mean, we could do that.
00:44:34 Well, I don't care what we do with it, honestly, but if we don't tank Ripple XRP when the release of that song comes,
00:44:40 we will have failed our mission, so that's my one thing that I want to have happen.
00:44:44 My one thing is that we're on the PCP channel right now.
00:44:48 That would be nice. That would be nice, Brad.
00:44:51 Help us out.
00:44:53 Where's this going?
00:44:54 No? Okay, never mind.
00:44:56 You're gonna upload this episode on your channel, Nate?
00:45:00 I don't know. Probably not, considering I already said I don't want to.
00:45:04 Yeah. Why is that?
00:45:06 There you go. Because my channel is for very specific content.
00:45:09 Okay. So, like, it wasn't in the plan or anything.
00:45:12 It wasn't in your plan or anything that, like, any of these PCP episodes might go up on your channel.
00:45:17 But the rest of us, though, that was our plan.
00:45:20 Uh, fair enough.
00:45:22 No, I'm saying that ironically, man. Being sarcastic.
00:45:25 I'm saying you're being selfish for not wanting to upload this on your channel,
00:45:28 when the rest of us are totally willing to do it.
00:45:30 That's what I'm saying. Fuck you.
00:45:32 You are welcome to have that opinion.
00:45:34 I do. Fair enough.
00:45:36 Okay.
00:45:38 Well, result.
00:45:40 Excellent.
00:45:42 Hey, Tom.
00:45:43 Yo.
00:45:44 What's going on with you, dog?
00:45:46 Uh, I made a cell shader, and I'm really proud of it.
00:45:50 That's what I did while everyone else doing PCP the last two weeks.
00:45:55 I figured it out.
00:45:57 I made in Blender a shader that looks just like a cartoon,
00:46:01 really easily, and it looks good, and it has line art that, like, scales.
00:46:05 It doesn't get distorted as a bunch of 3D nerd shit that most people don't understand.
00:46:09 But it looks great, and it's crisp, and it's perfect, and I love it,
00:46:12 and I put an animation up on Twitter.
00:46:14 Uh, it's great. 10 out of 10.
00:46:17 Unlocked full potential of doing cartoon style in Blender.
00:46:21 Really proud. 10 out of 10, good times.
00:46:23 What if we used 100% of our brain?
00:46:26 Oh, we have the answer. We have the answer.
00:46:28 Yeah, you get perfect cell shading. That's what happens.
00:46:31 I saw... I was reading political articles.
00:46:35 Oh, no. That's nothing to do with cell shading.
00:46:38 I got accidentally redirected to some article,
00:46:41 and it was like Jeff Bezos talking about...
00:46:47 No, no, it's like Trump says to Bill Gates,
00:46:50 like, you will not ban this invention. The American people need it.
00:46:54 I was like, what the fuck is this?
00:46:56 And it was talking about some, like, breakthrough.
00:46:59 Like, Bill Gates says, we can now access 100% of the brain.
00:47:03 It was just a fake article for, like, some brain pills.
00:47:07 It was just, like, some fucking brain pills of advertisement.
00:47:11 Thank you, Alex Jones for bringing those to our attention.
00:47:14 Yes, it was Alex Jones' tear shit, and I had been had.
00:47:18 I've been having those every day, and I can tell you they don't affect me very much.
00:47:22 Sorry, my internet...
00:47:23 I already had 100% of my brain, I guess. You know, what are you gonna do?
00:47:26 My internet cut out for a second. What was being said?
00:47:29 Brain pills.
00:47:30 Brain pills.
00:47:31 Brain pills.
00:47:32 Thumbs up or thumbs down.
00:47:33 He's a genius now.
00:47:34 He bought and invested.
00:47:35 Here's, I'll just run this by you guys.
00:47:37 This is a thought I was having earlier about a potential video I might make
00:47:42 about different types of level design and game design
00:47:47 and storytelling and game design.
00:47:49 And I was thinking about it because of Dark Souls.
00:47:52 I started playing Dark Souls 3 again, which is fucking bay.
00:47:56 It is.
00:47:57 I was thinking about how Dark Souls 1 is definitely way more open-ended.
00:48:02 There's a lot more you can do, a lot more variety in the ways you can play it.
00:48:06 But how Dark Souls 3 is so opulent and tightly crafted,
00:48:12 and it's like every single moment of it is really memorable, to me at least.
00:48:18 I was thinking about the trade-off between more modern and older games,
00:48:25 and how most modern games are trying to create a very linear, tightly crafted experience,
00:48:30 but with a lot of depth, at least in the visual and graphics department,
00:48:38 where they're trying to make it so that there's a lot of verbosity to the storytelling.
00:48:44 That's the term I've come up with.
00:48:46 The way I would describe what is verbosity in a video game setting is
00:48:50 if you were to translate this into a book, how many words would it take
00:48:54 to convey everything that's on the screen?
00:48:57 That's just a normal word, Digi. That just is a word that means that.
00:49:00 Yes.
00:49:01 Well, I'm applying it to game design, because in the case...
00:49:05 So to give an example of a game that I would consider to be not verbose,
00:49:11 but also extremely nonlinear would be Dwarf Fortress, right?
00:49:16 Almost anything can happen in that game, but the way that it will happen,
00:49:21 the way it will be described to you, is just a sentence telling you that it happened,
00:49:25 whereas in say like...
00:49:28 I think I've heard this video.
00:49:30 Yeah? Are you saying somebody's already made this point that I'm making here?
00:49:33 No, it's you. Didn't you talk about Dwarf Fortress in that big,
00:49:36 old or autistic something or other something?
00:49:38 I don't think so. I don't remember.
00:49:41 You were talking about all the different forms of our mediums and then how they...
00:49:45 Oh, I don't...
00:49:46 I don't think I did talk about Dwarf Fortress in that video, but maybe.
00:49:51 I don't remember if I did, but...
00:49:53 Anyway, point being that in that game, like, tons of things can happen,
00:49:57 but they will not be described in very much detail.
00:50:00 It's just kind of telling you that the thing happened,
00:50:02 as like in an uncharted game or something, even just like Nick Drake jumps and grabs ledge.
00:50:08 Like, that story is told in like an obscene amount of detail through the visuals and graphics and all that.
00:50:14 So, like, the question becomes, like, what makes...
00:50:18 I don't know if I agree with this at all.
00:50:21 Like, the game's state of Dwarf Fortress is so much more complex than any of these other games you're talking about.
00:50:31 We're talking about raw graphical representation, though, right?
00:50:34 To fully...
00:50:35 Well, that's such verbosity.
00:50:37 To fully describe the game's state of Dwarf Fortress would take so many more words.
00:50:43 Yes, well, that's the thing.
00:50:45 To describe the current game's state, but the game's state should be...
00:50:51 If I'm playing uncharted, for instance, like, if I were to say that, like,
00:50:56 describing this one moment, all that simply is happening is that Nate Drake is, you know, climbing up a wall.
00:51:02 But, like, that is in the middle of the ongoing story of what's happening.
00:51:06 Like, in Dwarf Fortress, one thing is happening right now.
00:51:10 But, yes, to describe everything that led up to that point would take a long time.
00:51:14 Well, one thing is happening, but, like, one thing is happening, like, everywhere simultaneously.
00:51:21 Like, a separate thing.
00:51:22 Like, every tile of the map has its own state and, like, every entity that exists has its own state
00:51:28 and, like, also history of everything that ever happened to it.
00:51:32 Would you say that that state is, like...
00:51:37 How do I put it?
00:51:39 Because, like, I agree with you that, like, keeping track of what's happening in Dwarf Fortress would be, like, a much more complex operation.
00:51:48 I'm just thinking about, like, if let's say that one of the stories being told in this game is, like, Dwarf goes too well, you know?
00:51:57 Like, there is nothing to that other than that phrase in that game, you know?
00:52:02 Whereas, like, Nate Drake Goes Too Well has a visual representation that tells another conglomerate of stories
00:52:09 through the art design and everything else like that, you know?
00:52:12 And this is...
00:52:14 I mean, there is information conveyed in...
00:52:19 I mean, I think both games have certain information that they do convey and certain information that they don't.
00:52:25 I mean, visually, in terms of, like, what it looks like when he does this thing, yeah, there's a lot more going on in Uncharted.
00:52:33 Are we talking about Uncharted?
00:52:35 Whatever game, it doesn't matter.
00:52:36 Uncharted is just the first HD, visually focused, you know, experience-driven game.
00:52:42 It was just making me think about how, essentially, you always are going to have to kind of pick where on this slider you want to be,
00:52:50 because there's, like, limited time and resources to get anything made.
00:52:53 And so, the more nonlinear an experience is going to be, the less verbose it necessarily can be within the same, you know, same resources
00:53:03 as making something linear but super verbose, you know?
00:53:06 You're talking about how you can't have a character progression and a story arc in Minecraft,
00:53:13 because it's Minecraft, you know, to have that, like, randomly generate would be impossible.
00:53:20 Yeah, that's...
00:53:22 Yes, that is partly what I'm saying as well.
00:53:25 Like, in any game where...
00:53:29 I guess I'm thinking more about, like, Asset Generation, like, the sheer complexity of Dwarf Fortress,
00:53:34 you can't, like, the reason it doesn't have a visual interface is that you'd have to just account for so many possibilities,
00:53:41 it would take fucking forever, you know, to create, like, an actual visual interpretation of what's happening.
00:53:47 So, you know, the way I see it, it's just like, any of those games, like, the games with the super complex systems almost never have super complex graphics, you know?
00:53:58 That almost always comes down to a more linear experience.
00:54:02 And, you know, on that point, it ties into the video I've long been thinking about making, which is this, like, whatever it is,
00:54:09 I've yet to find a satisfying teleport, but it's like the, like, cap or, like, the curve of, like, intellectual...
00:54:17 Like, the ceiling of intellectual complexity, meaning, the more, like, take your Final Fantasy XV, that game is quote-unquote complex,
00:54:24 but it's complex in many superficial ways that don't tie into, at least superficial in terms of gameplay,
00:54:29 but in terms of, like, rendering and graphical representation, like, all the complexity is there.
00:54:35 When it comes to gameplay, you mash X to attack. And there's other options, too.
00:54:38 And that's part of what I kind of want, like, the takeaway from this video idea I have to be.
00:54:46 And it's something I've been saying in a lot of my videos lately, is just that, like, I really think that when you're crafting a story,
00:54:52 you should always be asking yourself, like, what story am I telling right now?
00:54:56 Not so much in, like, the broad sense of, like, everything has to fit into my grand narrative,
00:55:01 but just that whatever you're doing, it should be telling a story.
00:55:06 It should contribute to the telling of a story, and if it doesn't tell a story or contribute to the story,
00:55:11 or it's not an interesting story, then just try to get rid of it, you know?
00:55:15 Like, if there's parts in a video game where, let's say you're just walking through empty space
00:55:21 and maybe that could be because, let's say you're playing Xenoblade, right?
00:55:25 And you're in a gigantic open field full of monsters and it's, like, really epic
00:55:30 and you feel swept up in the moment, like, that's a good story about wandering around through an open field.
00:55:35 But usually, wandering around through an open field is not a story and it's not interesting,
00:55:40 and, you know, you would want to cut down on how much random wandering there is in your game
00:55:46 unless that's, like, core to the point, like, Skyrim. And even then, it's boring.
00:55:50 It's just a connection, the connecting thread that needs to be there for the story
00:55:55 to feel the way that it does, you know?
00:55:58 But, like, overall, like, you know, trimming the fat is a good idea
00:56:04 and I think that the biggest problem with these AAA games that go all in on the graphics
00:56:10 is that they don't always tell the story.
00:56:13 They're not always contributing or at least not contributing enough
00:56:17 for it to be worth the extra effort they're putting in, you know?
00:56:20 It's like, how much, at what point does the verbosity become purple prose?
00:56:25 It's just fill in, you know, extra detail that really wasn't necessarily
00:56:30 and doesn't contribute to the story, you know?
00:56:32 That's nearly all of graphics. Like, how much does it...
00:56:36 The way of rock is rendered with, like, perfect lighting
00:56:40 and it's like, oh, it's glistening with water and it's also dynamic
00:56:43 and graphics intensive and computer intensive
00:56:46 and that rock, like, slightly more sells the realisticness of the location
00:56:52 but it's so redundant at some point.
00:56:55 Like, it's been redundant for years.
00:56:57 You can feel like...
00:56:59 For a game that isn't redundant, though, would be Dark Souls.
00:57:02 Like, Dark Souls 3, everything you see tells a story in that game, you know?
00:57:06 I was going to mention Bloodborne, but yeah, the same thing with that.
00:57:09 So, like, and even just the random things that are used to sort of spruce up the environment,
00:57:14 like, I think about Deus Ex Human Revolution, right?
00:57:18 That game has tons and tons of random, like, papers and stuff on all the desks in everybody's room
00:57:24 and it's almost all repeated.
00:57:26 Like, you can recognize the exact same assets in, like, every room in the game
00:57:30 but they're just there to make it so that every room feels like somebody lives in it, you know?
00:57:35 And I'm fine with that. Like, obviously, it's a little distracting that the same stuff comes up over and over again
00:57:42 but do I think that the game looks better with the clutter than it would without it?
00:57:46 I do kind of think so.
00:57:48 And, like, in the case of Dark Souls, like, there's all these random bodies strewn about all over the place, right?
00:57:52 But, like, you know, they're placed in ways that look good.
00:57:55 They contribute to the feeling of the setting and the story that has been told before you got there, you know?
00:58:00 And even if a lot of it is just obviously the same clone-stamped bodies, it's the way they're arranged,
00:58:06 the way that, you know, meaning is derived from putting a character next to an object
00:58:11 or putting it in this location or the story of, you know, going to this one random platform
00:58:17 is interesting because of the item layout and the enemy layout.
00:58:20 It's just the game is always telling a story.
00:58:23 Every single encounter is a story, you know?
00:58:26 This gives me a really cool idea.
00:58:29 Imagine a game that the story is about things being copy-pasted.
00:58:34 So it would be, you know, like mass-produced, like, everybody, like, there would be the same clutter in everybody's house,
00:58:39 but the reason all the clutter is the same is because everybody's being fed the same information
00:58:44 and they're sort of like a hive mind of people.
00:58:46 You could make the, you know, having to copy-paste things for saving money into the story of the game,
00:58:54 and then it would make more sense, and it would be like, oh, yeah.
00:58:58 That is a good idea.
00:59:00 I think, you know, this, tell your time.
00:59:03 Why don't you try and say something before I'll go after you?
00:59:05 I was just going to say, I think that the problem that you're talking about comes from just, like, intent and laziness, right?
00:59:10 Because, like, all these big AAA games, they want to be filmed.
00:59:13 Like, they're trying to be filmed.
00:59:14 That's why they have, like, these narrow scopes with this really, like, crazy amount of detail and stuff,
00:59:19 and also because, like, it's easier to sell to people,
00:59:22 especially when your entire industry is kind of based on technological progression.
00:59:25 So it's like making an uncharted game that has, like, basically no depth, but, like, is a visual tour de force,
00:59:30 is A, more filmic, which is what the normal people kind of understand.
00:59:34 Like, oh, it looks like a movie.
00:59:36 And it's easier to iterate on technical aspects than to be creative and build story.
00:59:43 And, like, the money still flows.
00:59:45 Yeah, I mean, in the case of Uncharted, like, I think they really, they base the Uncharted games around the set pieces for the most part.
00:59:53 So I think they look at it as, like, what's a crazy, exciting set piece we can create
00:59:58 and what is necessary to make that happen.
01:00:00 And, like, I do think that the realism of those games adds to those scenes where some of them are really well done.
01:00:08 Like, this comes down to a problem of, like, for instance, Tomb Raider in the new Tomb Raider series,
01:00:15 all the times where it, like, changes controls for a dramatic scene and, like, becomes a movie.
01:00:21 They all suck. They're horrible.
01:00:23 And, like, every time one of those scenes happens.
01:00:25 Because they have to be incredibly easy so you can do it instantly.
01:00:28 Or they're not incredibly easy to do the first time, but it's completely fucking just asinine.
01:00:34 Like, it's worse to fail it than it is to get it right the first time.
01:00:38 But those scenes, I hate them.
01:00:41 And every time they would come up, I would just think, like, man, this game had such a ludicrously overblown budget.
01:00:47 Because Tomb Raider 2013 or whatever, it was, like, it sold, like, six million copies
01:00:53 and was still a disappointment for Square Enix.
01:00:55 It's just like, why did you put all these fucking expensive scripted sequences that don't contribute anything to the story?
01:01:04 They are not interesting stories in and of themselves. They are dull, generic.
01:01:08 They're all the same story.
01:01:10 A lot of cruffed slides down a fucking hill.
01:01:12 That's, I mean, like, it's totally true, but Tomb Raider 1 or the 2013 one was critically acclaimed.
01:01:18 Everybody loved it. It got praise from everybody.
01:01:20 It is a great game, aside from those scenes. That's the thing.
01:01:23 Like, everything else it does, it does right.
01:01:26 But I think most people, I think there are a lot of people, like, the mass market,
01:01:30 that enjoy the spectacle of those scenes and don't care about the lack of complexity.
01:01:34 Maybe. But those are definitely true.
01:01:36 That is what I think is the biggest thing that hurts modern games is that they throw in too much frivolous shit
01:01:44 and one frivolous thing in a game that costs millions to generate, like, a second of gameplay, you know?
01:01:51 It's a lot of fucking wasted money.
01:01:53 Right.
01:01:54 Here's an interesting example about that.
01:01:56 So I've recently, I replayed Kingdom Hearts 3 recently on Critical Mode.
01:02:00 The game is a nightmare. It's a disaster, like, through most of it.
01:02:05 The only times that that game is good is some amusing, like, engagement between the Disney stories,
01:02:12 like the characters and the original Kingdom Hearts story.
01:02:15 Sometimes that's good, like in Monsters, Inc., a little bit, and in Toy Story.
01:02:19 Like, the ending of the game is an absolute nightmare, makes me want to kill myself.
01:02:23 Absolute fuck up.
01:02:24 But the DLC, well, first of all, Critical Mode was added, so now fighting is actually kind of fun,
01:02:29 and the DLC data boss fights at the end are actually good.
01:02:32 None of that was my point.
01:02:33 My point is that as I was playing through the game the second time,
01:02:36 and this is the first time, but whatever, there's a...
01:02:39 Have you guys ever played the game The Witness by Jonathan Blow?
01:02:41 You know what that game is?
01:02:42 I've heard of it.
01:02:43 I know it.
01:02:44 It's a...
01:02:45 For anyone who doesn't know, it's a perspective-based game where you walk around in a 3D environment.
01:02:50 That's correct. That's correct.
01:02:52 And it has...
01:02:53 That game, The Witness, has a unique feature about a lot of things...
01:02:56 Real quick, I would recommend actually...
01:02:58 Yeah.
01:02:59 It was Joseph Alexander who did a 45-minute review of that game, right?
01:03:03 And Joseph Anderson.
01:03:04 Joseph Anderson.
01:03:05 Yeah, I believe that's right.
01:03:06 That was a pretty good video.
01:03:07 That's the only video by that guy that I really enjoyed, so check it out.
01:03:11 Yeah, that's his best one.
01:03:12 Well, check it out.
01:03:13 Because interestingly enough, there is one thing that's...
01:03:15 I was wondering if it was maybe copied in KM3 from that,
01:03:18 and there's lots of these...
01:03:20 In certain positions in The Witness, things will line up in...
01:03:24 There's a thing you look for.
01:03:25 It's a dot with a line after it.
01:03:27 And it could be things like in a certain position on the island you're on,
01:03:31 the clouds will form that position.
01:03:33 You have to look at it in this perspective,
01:03:35 and then draw a line with your mouse, and it'll do something.
01:03:38 There's a mechanic similar to that in KM3,
01:03:41 which is these Mickey emblems that are scattered throughout the world.
01:03:44 And as you play through the game, you can find them.
01:03:47 And if you're very keen in looking for things...
01:03:51 For example, there's these three pillars of rocks
01:03:54 that don't look like anything as you're climbing Mount Olympus.
01:03:57 But when you get to the top of Mount Olympus and you look down at them,
01:04:00 suddenly they form the shape of Mickey's head,
01:04:03 which is the Mickey emblem, and you can take a picture of it,
01:04:06 and that gives you the achievement.
01:04:08 Stuff like that was cool.
01:04:09 And the thing to tie into what we were saying was that
01:04:12 one of those things, which actually didn't involve the perspective thing,
01:04:15 but as I was playing through the game, I got to Monster's Inc.
01:04:17 and I was fucking around doing stuff.
01:04:19 I beat the level.
01:04:20 One of the things they do in Kingdom Hearts is they recreate
01:04:23 places from the Pixar worlds in now an explorable 3D environment
01:04:27 in the Kingdom Hearts world.
01:04:28 And a lot of people just enjoy that,
01:04:30 even though they have to partner with a company and recreate every detail.
01:04:33 Blah, blah, blah. It's a whole big thing.
01:04:35 But one of the things is, if you remember on the scare floor in Monster's Inc.,
01:04:39 there's just desks where Mike Wazowski and Sully would work,
01:04:43 and Mike worked at his desk and had papers and stuff,
01:04:45 and Sully would go scare in the doors and then come back out.
01:04:48 So they've each got desks covered with paper.
01:04:51 As I was playing through the game again and getting all the emblems,
01:04:53 one of the desks, written on the paperwork,
01:04:56 has a unique thing, which is like a bunch of wires in a circle,
01:04:59 and those wires are a Mickey emblem.
01:05:01 They're in the shape of a Mickey emblem.
01:05:04 And you have to look for them specifically and find them.
01:05:06 And when I was going through and finding that,
01:05:08 at no point did I ever give a single fuck about anything that was on any of those desks,
01:05:14 as I was like blasting through the world,
01:05:16 just killing the Heartless and the Unversed as fast as I could to get to the end,
01:05:19 actually good part of the game.
01:05:21 But then I was like, as I got to that,
01:05:23 it made me suddenly take stock and kind of appreciate the environmental design
01:05:29 that had gone in here, which is something that I just absolutely would not have done
01:05:33 if I wasn't a completionist who wanted to get every little mini-game in the game completed.
01:05:39 And to tie it back to the point, it's just like they put so much work into all these details
01:05:44 that 99% of people will want 100% just blast by and not pay any attention to.
01:05:50 I mean, it's really funny because there's some places where you want to praise that,
01:05:56 and then other places where it's like, why did you bother?
01:06:00 Why did you try?
01:06:01 There's a give and take.
01:06:02 Obviously, most people will never see Ash Lake in Dark Souls,
01:06:05 but those who do will be like, this is a life-changing moment.
01:06:10 In Kingdom Hearts, I'm not sure if you will feel much once you finally do observe all that stuff
01:06:16 other than, oh, they put all this here? Why?
01:06:21 Yeah, I mean, that's true.
01:06:23 That mini-game is one of the more enjoyable actually gameplay things that was in the game from the start.
01:06:29 But I mean, it's true.
01:06:31 In the grand scheme of things, did that save the game?
01:06:33 Absolutely not.
01:06:36 It's a complicated thing how good that game is, but yeah.
01:06:39 In terms of the money and time, the 13 years to get the game done due to various reasons,
01:06:45 obviously it wasn't all that they were just building out specific stuff like this.
01:06:47 I'm just going to go ahead and call that, I mean, obviously what it is, bad project management,
01:06:51 which is just Square Enix in a nutshell.
01:06:54 The fact that they have had all of these issues, like the whole Tomb Raider being considered underselling
01:07:00 because of how much it costs, is just the kind of stuff you look at and you go like,
01:07:04 how fucked is your corporate structure that you can make this mistake?
01:07:08 Because I know that Square, obviously Square Enix isn't the studio that developed Tomb Raider,
01:07:12 but they are the publisher, so they were obviously part of it.
01:07:15 The fact that they agreed to like,
01:07:16 Well, and that they were having this issue on all their games,
01:07:18 because that year it was also like Hitman Absolution and fucking, what was it, Sleeping Dogs.
01:07:25 Those were all three games that they had published that all had sold millions of copies
01:07:29 and all were considered financial disappointments.
01:07:31 And all were just way over the top with the graphics.
01:07:34 And it's like, there's no need for this.
01:07:36 I don't know if this makes you as...
01:07:41 The reason they're all doing it is because I think it makes them competitive to have better graphics,
01:07:46 but it's like, you're being competitive with games that are selling 10 million copies.
01:07:51 You're not...
01:07:52 Only one in every so many games that even attempts to reach that audience is going to do so.
01:07:58 So it's just not worth the risk of trying to even do that.
01:08:02 I agree.
01:08:03 I agree.
01:08:04 There's an aspect to this as well, which is games that go for a heavy stylistic approach
01:08:10 where the heavy computer processing power is not required in any way.
01:08:17 And the art...
01:08:19 I was playing Okami, right?
01:08:21 The best game ever made.
01:08:24 And the game, if you're not aware, is about a dog, a wolf.
01:08:30 And you are the dog, and you are the wolf, and you are a god, and you have magic powers.
01:08:34 And because...
01:08:35 And it's like the graphic...
01:08:37 Graphical design is supposed to be that of like a Japanese painting, watercolour or calligraphy
01:08:42 and all that sort of cool, non-realistic looking shit.
01:08:46 And because of that, they can take massive shortcuts with things in the background.
01:08:54 In the background, there's no skybox, there's just a big blank colour and calligraphy mountain.
01:09:00 Just a big black line of just a mountain and a tree or various mountains.
01:09:05 When you're in the city, you can look up and you can see completely solid black silhouettes
01:09:12 of almost like paper cut out tall Japanese buildings looking things.
01:09:18 And that's all they need to give you the illusion that this is a huge city with loads of stuff in
01:09:24 and then the mountain is like this world is vast.
01:09:26 And it's really smart to go with something like that,
01:09:30 because not only did that game come out like a million years ago
01:09:33 and is still one of the best looking games I've ever seen in my life,
01:09:36 but they were able to make it back then in the same way.
01:09:41 They made HD versions, but nothing has been changed.
01:09:45 It's just the fidelity, the resolution rather.
01:09:48 So it's a time saver, it's a money saver, it's a graphics saver and it's just better.
01:09:56 Just don't do realism.
01:09:58 I just wish that the AAA market was what I think it should be like an enthusiast niche.
01:10:04 Right now it seems like games are dominated by people,
01:10:08 games that work as hard as possible to be the most technologically impressive.
01:10:13 I wish that was like with technology that the most advanced stuff is for that group that wants to get it
01:10:20 and be pushing the envelope, but that's not what it is.
01:10:23 Here's what I think happened and this is based on, there's a great show called What Happened on YouTube
01:10:30 by a guy called Matt McMussles where he breaks down games that flopped
01:10:34 or that had trouble developments, he goes through what happened.
01:10:38 And a lot of the time what he's talking about is how the seventh generation of consoles
01:10:42 basically killed everybody.
01:10:44 Making games for the PS3 and Xbox 360 just because of the fact that all the games
01:10:52 were trying to be the most expensive, most broad reaching game possible
01:10:58 and that's what the publishers wanted.
01:11:00 And so every promising game developer that starts to spring up, EA or whoever else comes in, buys them out
01:11:09 and gives them a shit ton of money to make a bigger, crazier game and they can't do it.
01:11:15 Making games on that scale, especially when they keep getting mandates from the publisher
01:11:19 for all these different things, oh now you gotta add multiplayer
01:11:22 because this game came out with a hugely successful multiplayer and now we all have to have it
01:11:26 and it's just like well it doesn't go in our game and it's expensive to implement, doesn't matter
01:11:30 now the game's uneven, it's gonna get seven out of ten scores, it's not gonna sell
01:11:34 more than one or two million when it needs to sell six or seven million
01:11:39 and the developer gets shut down.
01:11:41 And it just comes down to I think all these publishers looking at GTA and Call of Duty
01:11:47 and saying we have to be that successful.
01:11:50 We all want to be super rich giant corporations
01:11:54 and when you go in with that mentality that it's just like you're not thinking about how to make good art
01:12:00 you're thinking about how other people have made money trying to copy it without really understanding what they did
01:12:07 and then failing and it's just like this is not the environment to do creativity in
01:12:13 like if you want to make stories you have to think about the story you're making
01:12:17 what is the appropriate size of this project, what is the appropriate amount of effort and budget to spend on this
01:12:23 so that it can make profit you know and I think that with a lot of these triple A games
01:12:29 with all the crazy graphics and stuff really the problem is that the price of games has never increased
01:12:35 but the expectations have you know that like games keep being six well it's not that they never increased
01:12:41 but you know going into the seventh gen it became $60 was the standard but it's like you know $60
01:12:47 I could spend $60 on Dark Souls and they will be making way more money off of that $60
01:12:53 than Tomb Raider would have made off the same purchase you know and it's just like that's smart business
01:12:59 and that's why even a small developer like FromSoft by just not bloating their process
01:13:05 can keep making these games that feel like magic because they
01:13:08 I'm not even sure that they count as triple A but they are the only triple A company I trust
01:13:13 like only one I don't trust anybody else anymore
01:13:16 least of all Square Enix
01:13:18 well let's hope Elden Green is fucking baller
01:13:21 indeed
01:13:22 you have been playing Okami I recall you saying on Twitter
01:13:25 hell yeah it's fucking great
01:13:27 talk about how cool it is
01:13:29 it's the fucking shit I mean I just I find myself I constantly getting lost in Okami
01:13:35 just trying to figure out how Clover did all the fucking things they did
01:13:41 I don't understand because like a lot of the stuff in the game is just sprites to cut down on the poly count
01:13:47 because I'm playing Okami and like it's funny because you're saying like it's not very graphically taxing
01:13:52 and now it's not but I have a strong suspicion that at the time this was pushing the PS2 to its limits
01:13:57 maybe it was
01:13:58 a lot of the things they do
01:13:59 it never chugged on my PS2
01:14:01 yeah it's because it's like because the way they're doing the outlines for all the characters
01:14:06 they're doing what I'm doing it's called the inverted hull
01:14:09 it's where you duplicate the mesh and have it the back of the faces be transparent
01:14:14 so you can see through it and then you make it a little bigger
01:14:16 so all you see is the outline of this like duplicate shell around the main mesh
01:14:20 and so that doubles the poly count of everything in the game
01:14:24 and when you're working with this low headroom like the PS2 that's a problem
01:14:28 so the characters are all really simplistically designed
01:14:31 like the characters don't have any mouths that articulate or anything like that
01:14:34 the head just kind of jingle around when they're talking
01:14:36 and like there's like a poly count limit in the engine
01:14:39 because there's no enemies on screen you always go into this little tiny arena
01:14:43 when you encounter one of those scrolls and then the enemies spawn
01:14:45 so they don't have to draw the background
01:14:47 so there's tons of little like shortcuts they're doing
01:14:49 but it all just looks aesthetically gorgeous
01:14:51 because like it has like considered art direction from the very beginning
01:14:55 and like it's really interesting because like Okami originally was going to be a photorealistic game
01:14:59 like there's an old ass fucking trailer and screenshot of like a realistic Amaterasu
01:15:03 running in a realistic looking field
01:15:05 and it just wasn't feasible with the PS2
01:15:07 so they completely changed the art direction
01:15:10 and once they got the painterly style that's when they added the celestial brush
01:15:13 because they started like thinking of other ways to use this art style
01:15:16 reflected in gameplay
01:15:18 and there's just so many fucking cool things that the game does
01:15:20 and it's just so brilliantly considered
01:15:23 and the way the aesthetics and the gameplay blend together
01:15:26 it's fucking great it's like
01:15:28 Kamiya's the man dude
01:15:30 he really is
01:15:31 and the fact that like all these characters referenced
01:15:33 Devil May Cry and Beautiful Joe is fucking badass
01:15:35 every time you fight Wakka he makes a reference to one of Kamiya's other games
01:15:38 and it makes me lull
01:15:39 it's great
01:15:40 are you excited for a
01:15:41 probably for Okami
01:15:42 are you excited for the wonderful 101 ports
01:15:45 coming out
01:15:46 yeah cause I haven't played it
01:15:47 even though I have a Wii U
01:15:48 I never got around to buying it
01:15:49 cause at the time I didn't even realize that was a Kamiya game
01:15:51 cause I'm a fool
01:15:52 you know that's cool
01:15:54 I don't know if any of you saw it
01:15:56 I don't know if any of you saw it
01:15:57 the Matthew Matosis talking about the Kickstarter
01:15:59 where he straight up called Wonderful 101
01:16:01 his favorite game of all time
01:16:03 he did
01:16:04 damn
01:16:05 he said that Rain World
01:16:07 might be vying with it for domination
01:16:09 that was interesting
01:16:11 Matthew has a very specific taste
01:16:13 I know that his best favorite game of all time
01:16:15 is not going to be something that I would like on the same level
01:16:18 um but
01:16:19 maybe
01:16:20 like he's into that arcade stuff
01:16:22 Wonderful 101 was like oh yeah it's basically
01:16:25 beautiful Joe, Devil May Cry and Okami
01:16:27 all wrapped up into one game
01:16:30 so like the biggest come in the universe
01:16:32 I mean maybe
01:16:33 I have like very specific desires
01:16:35 and it's really just
01:16:36 I want to be in a three dimensional world
01:16:38 and have autonomy to turn around
01:16:40 anything that is like an arcadey version
01:16:43 like oh 2.5D makes me
01:16:45 you know that's a big trigger
01:16:47 that's a big no-no
01:16:49 where you have 3D but
01:16:51 you've taken it to the two dimension
01:16:53 and you're just fake 3D
01:16:55 I can't run around and jump on things
01:16:57 fuck you
01:16:58 but actually it's fine
01:17:00 I did beat that game
01:17:02 years ago
01:17:03 on a Friends Wii U
01:17:04 and I did like it a lot
01:17:06 uh
01:17:07 but I don't really care
01:17:09 that it's getting remade
01:17:10 but I'm happy for those who do
01:17:11 so Godspeed everybody who's
01:17:13 who's interested
01:17:14 I'll get it
01:17:15 it'll be sick I'm sure
01:17:16 I already have it
01:17:17 I prefer Devil May Cry
01:17:18 what can I say
01:17:19 I'm positive I'll prefer Devil May Cry
01:17:21 because it's my jam
01:17:22 and it's my favorite forever
01:17:23 for all time
01:17:24 I mean the fact of the matter is
01:17:25 that the reason the wonder
01:17:26 other than the fact that it's on the Wii U
01:17:28 I think the reason the wonderful 101
01:17:30 was always poised for lack of success
01:17:32 is just that it doesn't look
01:17:34 cool on the surface
01:17:36 like it looks deliberately
01:17:38 lame in a way
01:17:40 and I think that
01:17:42 whatever it is going for
01:17:44 obviously once you actually understand it
01:17:46 and you you know engage with it
01:17:48 then you'll appreciate it on its own terms
01:17:50 and I think that
01:17:51 Matthew Matosis is very good at that
01:17:53 and
01:17:54 like it fascinates me to see
01:17:56 the different reasons people like things
01:17:58 because like I tend to be of the opinion
01:18:00 that like I like it because it's good
01:18:02 you know and like
01:18:03 I like all kinds of things that are good
01:18:05 that appeal to me in some way
01:18:08 but like the main appeal
01:18:10 is the fact that it's good
01:18:11 whereas I think most people
01:18:13 the main appeal is on a conceptual level
01:18:15 more so it's like
01:18:17 that is like 80% of the battle
01:18:19 for most people
01:18:20 it's like I get to play as a cool guy
01:18:22 and slash things
01:18:24 it's like most of it
01:18:25 and then the fact that it's good
01:18:27 is what keeps you coming back
01:18:29 I think it's because most people's
01:18:31 like occupation isn't exploring media
01:18:33 and so they have to make choices
01:18:35 well it's funny because
01:18:37 that gets brought up every time I think
01:18:39 about this but like the reason
01:18:41 my occupation is exploring media
01:18:43 is because I love exploring media
01:18:44 like I made that my occupation
01:18:46 so not everybody has autism like you do
01:18:49 so that's another thing
01:18:50 well that's and it's sad because
01:18:52 everybody who I have ever known
01:18:55 who has experimented
01:18:58 it makes your life better
01:18:59 because you eventually find things
01:19:01 that you didn't know you wanted
01:19:03 it's like if I had never started
01:19:05 eating Asian food
01:19:06 I imagine my life would be very different
01:19:08 you would never love Japan period
01:19:10 right
01:19:12 it's just funny to me to think that
01:19:14 like because there's lots of people
01:19:16 especially when it comes to food
01:19:18 here in America
01:19:19 almost most of the people I know
01:19:21 or encounter have just never
01:19:23 even tried experimenting with other stuff
01:19:26 and I always come away like why
01:19:28 wouldn't you assume there are things
01:19:30 that you will love that are out there
01:19:32 that you haven't found yet
01:19:33 won't you be like so fucking hype
01:19:35 when you find out about those things
01:19:37 but I don't know
01:19:39 most people don't seem to care
01:19:40 they're just like I'm fine with what I got
01:19:41 and I'm like alright
01:19:42 there's a guy I know out here in Ohio
01:19:43 this doesn't speak highly of this
01:19:45 place in the country or the world
01:19:47 but who as far as he knows
01:19:49 has never eaten anything except
01:19:51 I believe it was fries and chicken tenders
01:19:53 his entire life
01:19:54 and this is just how he survives
01:19:56 that's it
01:19:57 my dad knew a guy who lived off hot dogs
01:19:59 so I guess it's possible somehow
01:20:01 fair enough
01:20:02 fair enough
01:20:03 you're just
01:20:04 by the way that reminds me
01:20:06 I am glad that this
01:20:08 remaster is coming or whatever
01:20:10 release for PC or whatever
01:20:11 because I'll probably play through it again on that
01:20:12 because I always want to take notice
01:20:14 of Matthew Matosis
01:20:15 and he's the guy who's made me
01:20:17 like Matthew Matosis introduced me to the idea
01:20:19 that like I should go back
01:20:21 I've beaten all the Devil May Cries
01:20:23 but like I should play them again
01:20:24 and find out why I don't get them
01:20:27 because I still don't understand
01:20:29 I mean I just haven't done this yet
01:20:30 I've been saying for a while
01:20:31 I need to find out why
01:20:33 the point system
01:20:35 and the trying to like master combat
01:20:37 is like particularly enjoyable
01:20:40 whatever I talked about this before
01:20:41 I don't get it yet
01:20:42 and I'm gonna make some effort
01:20:43 and Wonderful 101 is absolutely one of those games
01:20:45 where like the real goal
01:20:47 is to get pure platinum
01:20:48 unlike every mission
01:20:49 that's when you really beat
01:20:50 that's well I think there's a
01:20:52 I think that one of the biggest problems in game journalism
01:20:54 is that not enough people approach games
01:20:56 on their own terms
01:20:58 and it's because
01:20:59 every reviewer is reviewing
01:21:01 is trying to appeal to everybody
01:21:03 they're trying to like
01:21:04 imagine like the layman
01:21:06 like the perfect just gamer
01:21:08 who is generic
01:21:10 who will like the same things
01:21:12 whose opinion is predictable
01:21:15 you know like they're thinking
01:21:16 okay most people only play a game once
01:21:19 so let's review this from the perspective
01:21:21 of having played this game once
01:21:23 and it's like okay but in the case of
01:21:25 like Beautiful Joe
01:21:27 or any of Kamiya's games pretty much
01:21:28 like the point
01:21:30 is to play it more than once
01:21:32 like the game is not designed
01:21:34 with the expectation that you would play it only once
01:21:36 most of his games are like two to six hours long
01:21:38 you know wonderful one-on-one
01:21:40 I understand is much longer
01:21:42 but like you know the
01:21:44 yes you will have a good time
01:21:46 playing Devil May Cry through once
01:21:48 and that's kind of a testament to how great
01:21:50 the design of the game is
01:21:51 but like can you really review it
01:21:53 if you're not having the experience that
01:21:55 the game is meant to
01:21:57 to provide and will provide
01:21:59 at its best like
01:22:01 shouldn't we
01:22:03 shouldn't some reviewers
01:22:05 like make sure that they get to that point
01:22:07 before they really talk about the game
01:22:09 and that's why I appreciate Matthew Matosis
01:22:11 and Super Bunnyhop
01:22:13 so much as well
01:22:15 right they'll 100%
01:22:17 they'll go to the highest difficulty
01:22:19 and a lot of the times
01:22:21 you don't really get to experience all the systems
01:22:23 of a game until you go to the highest difficulty
01:22:25 because it will push you to have to learn
01:22:27 those systems especially Metal Gear Solid
01:22:29 where you know as he
01:22:31 put it in the MGS3 video
01:22:33 where he says like low level play looks like this
01:22:35 and he's like
01:22:36 looks like a super serious action game
01:22:38 and he's like high level play looks like this
01:22:40 and it's like five guys standing around a porn magazine
01:22:42 that then like spews out knock out gas
01:22:44 and knocks them all unconscious
01:22:46 and it's like yeah
01:22:47 just mastery of the systems completely
01:22:49 and just you can do it everyone
01:22:50 oh it's beautiful
01:22:51 and it's like obviously the average player
01:22:53 will not do those things
01:22:55 so reviewers don't try to account for it
01:22:57 but like what if the reviewer tried
01:22:59 to push you to do those things
01:23:00 like Matthew Matosis
01:23:01 he didn't just beat
01:23:03 like do a perfect run of Devil May Cry
01:23:05 he's like hey
01:23:06 why don't you challenge yourself
01:23:08 and try to get this good at some game
01:23:10 like surely there's a game
01:23:12 that you're passionate about
01:23:13 and like you will learn so much more about it
01:23:15 if you play it this way
01:23:16 so like if you really want to develop
01:23:18 a real relationship with your video game
01:23:20 like you know
01:23:21 just try some things
01:23:22 try some kind of challenge
01:23:24 absolutely true
01:23:25 I got to plug this thing real quick
01:23:26 because with the DLC release
01:23:28 for Kingdom Hearts 3
01:23:29 remind DLC
01:23:30 with all the actual good bosses
01:23:31 at the end of the game now
01:23:32 there has been an influx
01:23:33 of what's called
01:23:35 something like Kingdom Hearts 3
01:23:37 versus any of them
01:23:38 like Marluxia
01:23:39 level 1
01:23:40 no hits
01:23:41 and then with style
01:23:42 the rise of these with style videos
01:23:45 has been exactly what I've been hoping for
01:23:47 we would get
01:23:48 and it's all these people
01:23:49 doing insane
01:23:50 like you were saying
01:23:51 with Metal Gear Solid 3
01:23:52 just having such mastery of the system
01:23:54 and knowing exactly
01:23:55 every single thing you can do
01:23:57 you think that fighting Terra
01:23:58 or whatever
01:23:59 back in the day in Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix
01:24:00 was like
01:24:01 hard
01:24:02 the people who have mastery
01:24:03 they just
01:24:04 they can make them look like a child
01:24:06 it's almost embarrassing to watch the bosses
01:24:08 try to fight back
01:24:09 against truly masterful players
01:24:11 and there's one thing they'll do
01:24:13 the with style thing
01:24:15 I just want to say
01:24:16 the with style thing they do
01:24:17 the number one thing is that
01:24:18 there is a selfie mechanic
01:24:20 in Kingdom Hearts 3
01:24:21 and there is nothing more embarrassing for a boss
01:24:23 that when they are charging up their super weapon
01:24:26 and this player just knows
01:24:27 so they just do a pose with Sora
01:24:29 and do a big like little like
01:24:30 making fun of him
01:24:31 gesture with his fucking hand
01:24:33 and take a fucking selfie
01:24:34 while they're charging up their death beam
01:24:35 that they know
01:24:36 is going to do no damage
01:24:37 because they know how to deal with it
01:24:38 it's
01:24:39 it's a performance art
01:24:40 like the game
01:24:41 it is
01:24:42 the game allows you
01:24:43 the game is a template for you
01:24:45 essentially any video game
01:24:47 is a canvas for storytelling
01:24:49 that you participate in
01:24:50 it's like
01:24:51 how are you going to
01:24:52 contribute to making this story good
01:24:54 are you going to
01:24:55 you know
01:24:56 if you play like shit the whole game
01:24:58 it's a shitty
01:24:59 it's probably going to feel like a shitty story
01:25:01 you know
01:25:02 but if you master it
01:25:03 you can make the story
01:25:04 into something very different
01:25:05 and like
01:25:06 like you were saying
01:25:07 I'm imagining Dark Souls players
01:25:08 who will use the emotes extensively
01:25:11 and just how fucking funny
01:25:13 some of the videos are where
01:25:15 you know
01:25:16 they're doing all this crazy stuff
01:25:17 in the game
01:25:18 or fucking with other people
01:25:19 and then using the emotes
01:25:20 and like it
01:25:21 it allows you to have charisma
01:25:23 in as a game avatar
01:25:25 you know
01:25:26 see that
01:25:27 that's the kind of review
01:25:28 like I want one of those people
01:25:29 to make my reviews
01:25:30 of my video game
01:25:31 and that's why
01:25:32 when I made my first
01:25:33 Kingdom Hearts 3 review
01:25:34 that's why
01:25:35 Seth Zenak is the best game reviewer
01:25:37 yeah that's right
01:25:38 I was so clear on mine
01:25:39 like this is the first one
01:25:40 I will get back to you
01:25:41 I'm going to fucking
01:25:42 master the DLC
01:25:44 so I can be
01:25:45 I've been dreaming of this
01:25:46 for years
01:25:47 that I will be the guy
01:25:48 even if other people have done it too
01:25:49 who does the equivalent of
01:25:51 you know
01:25:52 fucking
01:25:53 super bunny hops
01:25:54 100% middle of your solid 5
01:25:55 I'm going to be the 100%
01:25:57 Kingdom Hearts 3 DLC guy
01:25:58 just give me 6 months
01:26:00 and you know
01:26:01 I'll be there
01:26:02 it's going to be good
01:26:03 it's going to be good
01:26:04 wait
01:26:05 shut up
01:26:06 wait before we go to voicemails
01:26:07 I have to talk
01:26:09 what's the matter Ben
01:26:10 you don't like video games
01:26:11 oh I want to talk about politics
01:26:12 I'm super
01:26:13 yes I am
01:26:14 super bored by this
01:26:15 well I have to call
01:26:16 I have to have a
01:26:17 a discussion
01:26:18 I got to reconvene
01:26:19 with Ben and Nate
01:26:20 because
01:26:21 when this episode comes out
01:26:22 it'll be the end of February
01:26:24 and if you recall
01:26:25 in the beginning of January
01:26:27 we all made a pact
01:26:28 oh dear
01:26:29 about being healthy fit boys
01:26:31 and I just want to say
01:26:32 that since that day
01:26:33 every day
01:26:34 100% keto

01:26:37 down almost 20 pounds
01:26:39 how are you guys doing
01:26:40 very nice
01:26:41 that's fantastic
01:26:42 I have been keto
01:26:43 for the last several weeks
01:26:45 I haven't weighed myself
01:26:47 but diet-wise I'm doing good
01:26:49 I'm on track
01:26:50 dope
01:26:52 okay
01:26:53 I'll be
01:26:54 that agreement was for one month
01:26:55 and I definitely failed that month
01:26:57 I'm back
01:26:58 obviously it's the end of February now
01:27:00 I have
01:27:01 failed
01:27:02 oh no
01:27:03 failed is the short version
01:27:04 okay

01:27:09 gonna
01:27:10 gonna do my best
01:27:12 I had free pizza thrown in front of me
01:27:14 multiple times
01:27:15 I did resist
01:27:16 now that's Will
01:27:17 you know what
01:27:18 I'm glad this exists so that Tom
01:27:19 you represent
01:27:20 the good aspect
01:27:21 like what one could aspire to be
01:27:23 well done
01:27:24 I am probably the worst
01:27:25 I gained a couple pounds while I was away
01:27:27 I'm the guy who's getting really good at Kingdom Hearts instead
01:27:28 instead I was really good at Kingdom Hearts
01:27:30 yeah I didn't even do that
01:27:31 I was just on vacation doing nothing
01:27:32 ooh what a waste
01:27:33 we all have our strengths and weaknesses I suppose
01:27:36 I mean I haven't picked up lifting again
01:27:40 which I wanted to do
01:27:41 but I didn't do that
01:27:42 yeah
01:27:43 I will make a vow
01:27:44 I'll go today
01:27:45 people listening
01:27:46 be inspired
01:27:47 even if you're in the hole
01:27:48 fix it
01:27:49 I'm gonna go to work
01:27:50 Jim
01:27:51 it's never too late
01:27:52 I'll go there
01:27:53 that's right
01:27:54 we got
01:27:55 by the way
01:27:56 11 days till Radcon 3
01:27:57 so
01:27:58 better get beach body ready
01:27:59 real fast
01:28:00 it's impossible to do that
01:28:01 it's impossible to do that
01:28:02 or Radcon 4
01:28:03 after that
01:28:04 you could lose 10 pounds easy
01:28:05 in 11 days
01:28:06 it's not about 10
01:28:07 it's not about 10 pounds
01:28:08 it's that I have body hair
01:28:09 and it looks bad
01:28:10 you could shave it
01:28:11 that's a doable thing
01:28:12 I'm gonna shave my whole body
01:28:13 it's weird
01:28:14 why not
01:28:15 literally why not
01:28:16 that's what people do
01:28:17 I'm gonna give
01:28:18 having the body hair
01:28:19 or shaving
01:28:20 that's the question
01:28:21 both are gay
01:28:22 both of those things are gay
01:28:25 yeah
01:28:26 he's right
01:28:27 the problem is
01:28:28 there's no getting around
01:28:29 the
01:28:30 Radcon body is
01:28:31 gonna be gay
01:28:32 no matter what we do
01:28:33 so
01:28:34 it doesn't matter
01:28:35 how you want to
01:28:36 everything you do is gay
01:28:37 yeah
01:28:38 actually
01:28:39 you know what
01:28:40 I think
01:28:41 I mentioned a long time ago
01:28:42 I have a fitness
01:28:43 wall
01:28:44 around here somewhere
01:28:45 or like I've got
01:28:46 like a chart
01:28:47 did you saw this
01:28:48 when he came to visit
01:28:49 all my fitness goals
01:28:50 one of them has long been
01:28:51 for like
01:28:52 the five years I've had the chart
01:28:53 shave your entire body
01:28:54 from the neck down
01:28:55 maybe Radcon 3
01:28:57 is the
01:28:58 Radcon 3 is dead
01:28:59 Radcon 4
01:29:00 I mean okay
01:29:01 because bodybuilders do it
01:29:03 a lot of them are just like funny
01:29:04 like
01:29:05 be like a bodybuilder
01:29:06 yeah you want to be funny
01:29:07 yeah I see
01:29:08 it's a joke
01:29:09 but
01:29:10 wait wait
01:29:11 I'm laughing
01:29:12 before we go to voicemails
01:29:13 I did want to say
01:29:14 one last thing about video games
01:29:15 sure
01:29:16 talking about like the whole
01:29:18 with style thing
01:29:19 I feel like
01:29:20 I come on like a different
01:29:22 like if there's two sides to this coin
01:29:24 one is the Devil May Cry
01:29:25 play the game over and over again
01:29:27 to get mastery of it
01:29:28 and the thing I like
01:29:30 which is more
01:29:31 to play a game
01:29:32 what I would consider
01:29:34 Devil May Cry side
01:29:35 would be like arcade
01:29:36 like part of
01:29:38 the fun is performing well
01:29:40 in front of other people
01:29:41 in the arcade
01:29:42 looking at you being the cool kid
01:29:44 playing the video game
01:29:45 and the other side is
01:29:47 just living
01:29:49 in a video game world
01:29:51 and just having autonomy
01:29:52 and doing things
01:29:53 and then existing
01:29:54 I don't really feel
01:29:55 the need to perform well
01:29:57 and so when a game is like
01:29:58 you have to be incredibly good
01:30:00 otherwise it sucks
01:30:01 as in
01:30:02 with the case of Kingdom Hearts
01:30:03 if it's like
01:30:04 you're playing it casually
01:30:05 you can play on easy
01:30:06 but
01:30:07 it's not
01:30:08 on easy it's just boring
01:30:09 and you have to
01:30:10 you have to play
01:30:11 on the harder difficulties
01:30:12 for it to be fun
01:30:13 which is why I didn't like it that much
01:30:14 the game is only good
01:30:15 I would argue
01:30:16 at a high level of play
01:30:17 when you're
01:30:18 so like
01:30:19 when the baseline
01:30:20 enjoyment is
01:30:21 the arcade thing
01:30:22 I don't really gravitate towards it
01:30:24 but something like
01:30:25 Minecraft
01:30:26 or World of Warcraft
01:30:28 where
01:30:29 it's just
01:30:30 you
01:30:31 can escape from the world
01:30:33 and play a game
01:30:34 and be a game character
01:30:35 doing something
01:30:36 I mean Dark Souls
01:30:37 I would consider this as well
01:30:38 because
01:30:39 you don't need to
01:30:40 necessarily be very good
01:30:41 you can put loads of points into
01:30:43 the OP thing
01:30:44 and just
01:30:45 run around
01:30:46 and be powerful
01:30:47 it's interesting you mentioned that
01:30:48 with Dark Souls
01:30:49 because of the fact that
01:30:50 like
01:30:51 if you know how to
01:30:52 make it easy
01:30:53 then Dark Souls
01:30:54 can be a game where you run around
01:30:55 like a
01:30:56 good
01:30:57 one of the main reasons
01:30:58 to play Dark Souls
01:30:59 is kind of as a horror game
01:31:00 which obviously
01:31:01 the more you master it
01:31:02 the less you get out of that
01:31:03 I was explaining to May the other day
01:31:05 that the funny thing about Dark Souls
01:31:07 is that people are always talking about
01:31:08 giving it an easy mode
01:31:09 or whatever
01:31:10 the reality is that the game is too easy
01:31:12 yeah like
01:31:13 there's no way to make it hard
01:31:14 is really like
01:31:15 you have to make it hard
01:31:17 by your own volition
01:31:18 you have to do things to yourself
01:31:20 to make the game harder
01:31:21 there is no hard mode
01:31:23 New Game Plus is not significantly harder
01:31:25 and it only
01:31:26 becomes harder
01:31:27 you know
01:31:28 for a certain amount of time
01:31:29 so it's like
01:31:31 yeah I think that
01:31:32 that what makes Dark Souls
01:31:34 so fascinating
01:31:35 is that it can be
01:31:36 both of those games at once
01:31:37 you know
01:31:38 that it both is a game
01:31:39 where you can just hang out in the world
01:31:40 and do whatever
01:31:41 and it's also a game
01:31:42 where you can do the most
01:31:43 crazy flamboyant
01:31:44 challenge run
01:31:45 you know
01:31:46 and like
01:31:47 a game like Devil May Cry
01:31:48 only has one of those two
01:31:49 aspects really
01:31:50 you know like
01:31:51 when I watch people play Devil May Cry 5
01:31:53 it's obvious to me that like
01:31:54 a huge part of the appeal
01:31:56 to people who love the game
01:31:57 is how complex the battle system
01:31:59 or the abilities you have are
01:32:01 and how much shit you can do
01:32:04 and like for me
01:32:05 it's like
01:32:06 I appreciate that at high level play
01:32:08 you'll be forced to do all those things
01:32:10 and therefore
01:32:11 the game does kind of require you
01:32:13 to get good
01:32:14 for the game to be good
01:32:15 but you can play it on normal
01:32:17 you can just spam
01:32:18 the same attack over and over again
01:32:20 the game just not nearly as good
01:32:22 and it's still good
01:32:24 I mean I like all the Devil May Cry games
01:32:25 even though
01:32:26 I've mostly just kind of
01:32:28 you know
01:32:29 played them in a boring way I guess
01:32:31 or Bayonetta for a better example
01:32:33 I got a stone statue
01:32:34 on almost every mission
01:32:35 still beat the game
01:32:36 in like eight hours
01:32:37 you know it's not like a
01:32:39 the only thing that makes the game
01:32:41 super hard is trying to do well
01:32:43 but that's also the
01:32:45 you know for me
01:32:46 Bayonetta is like an 8 out of 10 game
01:32:48 I completely understand
01:32:49 why it would be a 10 out of 10
01:32:51 to somebody who
01:32:52 does want to engage in those systems
01:32:54 you know but like
01:32:55 Dark Souls can be a 10 out of 10 for me
01:32:57 without being any good at it
01:32:59 in fact Dark Souls would 10 out of 10 for me
01:33:01 before I fucking played the game
01:33:03 Remember back in the days
01:33:05 when Digi hadn't played Dark Souls
01:33:07 that whole saga
01:33:08 I remember that
01:33:09 it was a good time
01:33:10 I enjoyed it
01:33:11 Alright let's
01:33:12 go to the voicemails
01:33:13 voicemails okay alright

01:33:39 okay and
01:33:40 go

01:33:52 it's a
01:33:53 it's a

01:33:59 it's a
01:34:00 it's a
01:34:01 ahhhhhhh
01:34:04 remember when we had only
01:34:05 earned $30,000
01:34:07 Redcon
01:34:08 I feel so bad
01:34:10 for anyone that wasn't watching
01:34:11 one of our streams live
01:34:13 when we
01:34:14 it was
01:34:15 it was
01:34:16 it was
01:34:17 it was a great time
01:34:19 we were all just like
01:34:20 streaming each other's streams
01:34:22 yea that's right
01:34:24 this guy left a second one
01:34:25 after we hit 33,000
01:34:26 but it was pretty much
01:34:27 just the same thing
01:34:28 oh 33
01:34:29 three I think I get the idea to discuss that on this episode I oh somehow days
01:34:35 ago I thought that would be the entire episode but it's been a few days and now
01:34:42 it's boring now it's lame it's boring now now I'm just now I'm just back to
01:34:46 being mad that YouTube hasn't given the channels back yet sure sure human
01:34:50 happiness is a fleeting thing we want to see the biggest come you've ever seen
01:34:54 your life go watch one of the recordings of the live stream if people
01:34:58 want I tweeted one out on my on my Twitter it's because I private the
01:35:01 live shows would have been the one that went the longest so if you want the the
01:35:04 entire thing you'd go to him but uh yes but I read my chair go most your
01:35:11 head is red in my stream because you were on my yes well but everyone else
01:35:15 could hear me saying it was read more than Nate's by me yeah that's true all
01:35:23 right well I mean shit what is there anything else I mean we funded what do
01:35:25 we fund on that stream we earned over one one one one one dollars more than
01:35:29 that we earned like the Kickstarter ran until noon that day between midnight and
01:35:34 noon we earned like $12,000 so we earned like a thousand dollars an hour that
01:35:38 whole day and like like ten thousand hours yeah those last two hours are
01:35:44 worth a week for sure we put the the the gruff showing the spike yeah yeah show
01:35:50 notes will link the the tweet with the chart okay yeah I'll get it right after
01:35:54 this okay well yeah what do we find we got we got over the 2222 which I don't
01:36:02 even remember what that was we because we were sure that at the start we were
01:36:06 trying to get genome was 25 25 well remember we had already hit the 2222
01:36:12 by the time we started the live stream then cuz that's right trying to get
01:36:15 genome mm-hmm there was an animated we got him he's confirmed there's an animated
01:36:20 OP there is there's a dojin to go along with the OVA we missed we missed the
01:36:28 ultimate stretch goal of did you making a funny face on Twitter yeah by less than
01:36:33 a thousand dollars which means I was thinking that blur out his face and
01:36:37 every whenever did you make a funny face in the OVA we should censor it saying
01:36:43 funny face you didn't pay for it so you can't have it yeah that's right he's not
01:36:48 allowed to make funny faces how will we know if I'm making a funny face or not
01:36:51 well you know when you see people hey rate these faces and then we'll blur out
01:36:56 the funniest one it's always funny so we just can't show it at all it makes
01:37:02 sense all right next voice mail we funded all kinds of great stuff it's gonna be
01:37:06 correct and just FYI when you hear this literally when you hear the next one one
01:37:10 day one week from now that is the start of radcon one week from when you are
01:37:14 hearing this Jesus seven days from two days I should probably start working on
01:37:19 my fucking yeah yeah yeah we all should I have to figure out what I'm gonna
01:37:24 lecture about because I don't have enough time to do the research for the
01:37:27 other ideas I had fair enough fair enough and let's do faces it would
01:37:35 faces for a straight hour and I'm okay all right next voice mail this is from
01:37:42 21 means I am immortal okay and go hey PCP let's give me my birthday today
01:37:51 before you're listening to this so it's gonna be my 21 birthday and I just
01:37:56 really want to get smashed so what should I do and how should I do it thanks
01:38:02 what do you think we get smashed by drinking alcohol straight vodka shots
01:38:07 it's the cheapest way to do it why spend your money go to your local game
01:38:12 store sign up for the smash tournament get smashed oh god no just jump into a
01:38:25 river just just end it all that's what I would do although do you think he meant
01:38:31 maybe he said before you hear this I'm gonna turn 21 maybe like before like not
01:38:36 even on the day that we're playing this but like some period beforehand maybe
01:38:39 he's like already 21 that's why I was confused by the question beer before
01:38:43 liquor never been sicker drink yeah yeah take shots first and then switch to
01:38:48 beer that's what you do have sex okay let's move on that's my recommendation
01:38:54 oblivion rent a car okay let's go on right well driving off a bridge that's
01:39:02 a birthday to remember rent a car drunk drive drunk kill yourself all right
01:39:08 we've got another voicemail from tarbuck transom everyone's favorite belt
01:39:12 Smith on the go that is tarbuck yeah that's him yeah okay good good let's
01:39:17 hear what I say all right take it away go all right like he's no offense enough
01:39:21 waiting around it's time for coordinated action the slow burn method isn't
01:39:25 working to get the channels back and we all know YouTube only responds to bulk
01:39:29 pressure if you can hear the sound of my voice you are compelled by justice to
01:39:33 message YouTube on Twitter next Thursday if you are truly a blessed night like me
01:39:38 you'll be doing it every six hours by the time they record the next podcast they
01:39:42 should have the channel back safe and sound you know your mission get at it
01:39:46 boys email email the YouTube support and in addition to the tweets because
01:39:54 sure in my experiences mass email gets people's attention the most because it
01:39:59 feels really serious and scary the mass tweets they hit the whoever like that
01:40:05 PR HR person is who's managing that Twitter we've been helped on Twitter it
01:40:09 just hasn't helped so it's like we gotta we gotta be we gotta they said on
01:40:14 Twitter they said like we're ready to restore the channel like you just need
01:40:18 to do this and then Nate you went and you did the things to it's almost like
01:40:24 every time we raise a stink they try to get us to stop by telling us that they're
01:40:29 doing something about it and then they don't do anything about it here go we
01:40:33 need to just consistently be reason raising a stink I guess yeah live update
01:40:38 okay this was like this morning and I need to reply to it I think we got one
01:40:41 more update let me see what we also we weirdly got like access to the can
01:40:45 tent like email address back but not the channel or something right okay didn't
01:40:50 you not lose the email address and like didn't they just go into the email and
01:40:54 transfer the channel to another yeah that's not exactly correct as did you
01:40:58 said like they said something about how they've detected like spam like videos
01:41:02 are being posted or like they know it's not us and they can see it was hacked and
01:41:06 they said like they were gonna give back the Google account okay so like things
01:41:11 are wrong we have the Google account there is so much confusion by dealing
01:41:14 with it they obviously do not know the specific issue if you log into the can
01:41:18 tent Google account there are two like listings of it like as though there were
01:41:26 you know both the channel and the non-channel version of the email anybody
01:41:30 who has a YouTube account probably knows what I'm talking about but or YouTube
01:41:33 channel but the the thing is they both say no videos neither one is the can
01:41:40 tent channel so you can sign into two different versions of can tent and not
01:41:43 have access to the channel and I'm like well what how do I get into the channel
01:41:48 like who has that there's that second channel is here's the way they restore
01:41:52 it they ask you to make a new brand account which is different from like a
01:41:57 user account it's you know it's like right it won't ask for like first and
01:42:00 last name this is just the account name of like can't enter whatever and then
01:42:03 like once you make a new brand account on whatever Google account you say they
01:42:08 and then you give them that link they will like port the channel to that brand
01:42:12 account that you have created they'll like stick everything on I'm waiting for
01:42:17 it that will become I gave them all the information I don't know what the fuck
01:42:20 they're waiting for by the way just just here's a little update I'm gonna
01:42:24 respond to this after we're done here but it said like so the team responded
01:42:28 they have confirmed that the PCP was hijacked on January 23rd okay do you
01:42:33 hear that they have confirmed their hijacked after this happened they start
01:42:38 remember how they were streaming today on the fucking PCB channel after the team
01:42:42 confirmed they were fucking hacked what the why haven't you stopped them from
01:42:47 doing shit if you know it was hacked I think they might be hacks over at the
01:42:51 YouTube support I don't understand okay anyway I'm gonna touch base with those
01:42:56 people but hey I don't see any reason not to spam them with emails what's the
01:43:02 probably do a lot of good honestly be respectful people and I would encourage
01:43:09 you to list all the channels I think Nate you have all the channels listed in
01:43:13 your Twitter bio right I do I do you know can't attend a podium cast tea bath
01:43:19 and so on there's like seven of them or something that we have you know it seems
01:43:24 to me like we're close to getting the PCP back but I said that first like a week
01:43:28 ago so you know slightly won't give them back until we harass them into doing it
01:43:35 and they get sick of it and they won't give us they'll just give us back one
01:43:39 channel at a time we're just gonna have to keep harassing them until we get every
01:43:43 chance like we're gonna have to do the same thing for every single one so let's
01:43:47 probably just commit to doing that works for me so as Tarbuck said
01:43:53 Thursday I retweet on the TP Crasinators channel I retweet everyone that posts
01:44:00 hashtag save the PCP with you and that adds team YouTube I would encourage and
01:44:06 like I would encourage everyone to tweet hashtag save the PCP with all like list
01:44:10 all the channels that we want back and then and at the YouTube and then go in
01:44:14 and like everyone else's tweets so they're just getting like a flood of
01:44:17 sure sure yeah god I hope we have the channel back before the Thursday he's
01:44:21 talking about cuz that would be me a long time from now don't wait till
01:44:27 Thursday just do it all the time yeah whenever you like it anytime's a good
01:44:32 time to email and like and message and make and at the fucking team YouTube we
01:44:38 want PCP back in particular it's urgent but we want all of them back and I won't
01:44:42 take no for an answer Nate how many more voicemails we got two there are two
01:44:49 more excellent all right here's one this one's just called a sweet listen up
01:44:53 here we go
01:44:59 scrum deli umptress I have to say but you know much to my chagrin when I went
01:45:06 to the Washington Monument I did not see a speck of Brad or garlic in sight no
01:45:11 but you know it's hard to stay mad when you're drawing a nice a juicy a sweet
01:45:18 a grapefruit with loaves of bread loaves with L O A F S Nate look I know
01:45:28 you're a big chump supporter and all but that doesn't mean right not see
01:45:32 especially but I will not leave you guys alone I'll be coming through your
01:45:41 windows and snatching your grapefruits up but I'm gonna leave on a bit of a
01:45:46 positive note here's a picture that you may find a little appealing monster he's
01:45:55 pouring sweet and directly on to the grapefruit voice jail voice jail voice
01:46:00 straight to voice jail what was this guy's name for okay whatever we'll look
01:46:04 it up on on fucking DVR it's quandary poser so like a splatter on the ground
01:46:10 it's absolutely horrendous he's gonna you know as a matter of fact that off the
01:46:14 black the asphalt you know but before this I couldn't get into the DVR like I
01:46:19 saw this linked on the thing and like I tried to click on it it was literally
01:46:23 locked because it was said like contains adult content this image so I had to
01:46:28 log in to fucking like the t-bap DVR for back of the day cuz it's the only one I
01:46:32 knew how to get into and yeah anyway quandary poser you are a fucking monster
01:46:36 for a number of reasons by the way I just realized not only did we forget to
01:46:41 talk about our extreme success with our thing but we also forgot to talk about
01:46:45 the fight this episode is on reserve it's on reserve what is that on hold
01:46:57 no just just isn't we can bleep just the number nothing else sure then bleep
01:47:07 that bleep it all bleep no bleep this everything we're all saying I want a
01:47:14 solid minute of what's our position then on what this episode is canonically this
01:47:18 is 201 obviously okay so we're not coming out let you live from the future this
01:47:24 is just 200 okay great got it all right that moving on okay right we have one
01:47:31 last message one last fucking voicemail okay here's the thing this one is very
01:47:37 long and we can cut it off anytime but what it is is that one dune coon made a
01:47:43 a PCP something like a radcon fanfiction and they converted it to audio and we
01:47:50 have it here it's like four minutes long anytime we can cut it off anytime but
01:47:54 let's just listen to a snippet of it and if we like it we can listen the whole
01:47:56 thing but we'll we'll see how it goes okay here we go and take it away dune
01:48:01 coon impress me go you're listening to an abridged version of radcon the
01:48:06 untold story by dune coon duji bro was sitting in front of his work computer
01:48:12 desperately trying to thrust his uncircumcised seven-inch penis in between
01:48:16 the thighs of his shinobu oshino anime figurine when the knock came out his
01:48:21 door he'd almost managed it when a second knock rang out breaking his deep
01:48:25 concentration what the who the fuck is here did he asked shinobu he rose from
01:48:30 his cum stained office chair and hobbled towards the front door peeping
01:48:33 through the peephole and readying his 3d printed gun which was a dick show
01:48:37 preaching on reward and opened up what's up nigga Nate greeted
01:48:45 saying the n-word is funny it wasn't a lie he had spent the morning trying to
01:48:55 figure out how to fit more of his fetishes into the story maybe I can make
01:48:59 shinobu like some fairy things like yui from sorda online then I could fucking
01:49:03 even smaller version of her I mean talk whom I could fucking even smaller
01:49:06 version of her yeah that's what I meant with that out of the way and all
01:49:10 pleasant not into many girls with no obvious direction to steal the
01:49:14 conversation they stood in silence eyeing each other up did you bros overwhelming
01:49:19 fatness was rapidly escaping from his clothing his oily hair clung to his
01:49:22 equally oily skin like he was rubbed down by a Japanese prostitute but even
01:49:27 with his physical abnormalities there was something about digi that Nate just
01:49:31 found irresistible it wasn't his uncircumcised 7-inch penis it was his
01:49:35 uncircumcised 7-inch brain
01:49:39 it was nothing more than a professional appreciation Nate had insisted
01:49:46 nothing more I'm gay digi was one of Digi's personal names I try not to hold it
01:49:56 against you Nate replied but it was for naught Digi had become painfully
01:50:01 aware that he was not currently ingesting drugs and sought to remedy
01:50:04 this as soon as possible without another word did he marched back to his
01:50:08 work desk he started up his water-cooled desktop tower which also
01:50:11 functioned as a bong he took a long hit and invited Nate to come sit next to
01:50:15 him you want some of this did he asked politely Nate was hesitant to partake
01:50:20 in Digi Bo's debauchery but the long and uncomfortable flight had left his body
01:50:24 and mind withered it felt like he had just gotten hit by the wither in
01:50:27 Minecraft and it was now a scene from being withered like in the video game
01:50:30 Minecraft followed Digi's example and did the weed it took effect immediately
01:50:35 Nate was no stranger to weed but he should have known that Digi Bo's personal
01:50:38 tolerance would have been multiple times higher than his own pretty strong right
01:50:42 I brought it off the deep web did you explain and by that I mean I bought it
01:50:46 from a black guy never having actually met a black person Nate was having
01:50:52 trouble focusing on the computer screen it was consistently blocked by Digi
01:50:56 exhaling fat clouds of smoke and after a few more lips for himself Nate's
01:51:00 throat had become dry I'm gonna go grab a drink Nate announced rising from his
01:51:04 seat do you have any off-brand LaCroix did you bro never got the opportunity to
01:51:08 answer because once Nate stopped using his chairs of support he fell face
01:51:11 forward right into his friend and in their intoxicated states neither of them
01:51:16 were able to grasp what had exactly happened if they were sober both of them
01:51:19 would have noticed Nate's hand grasping Digi Bo's uncircumcised seven inch
01:51:23 penis there's Dr. Pepper pajama pants immediately as things were took me at a
01:51:27 good 30 seconds and even after that his brain failed to process the next
01:51:31 reasonable course of action Digi bro who tried to have his uncircumcised
01:51:34 seven inch penis touched at all times made no attempts to push Nate off it was
01:51:38 like that one scene in Evangelion except dumb and gay you're a big guy noted for
