00:00:00 Jim Priest is Georgia Tech's kicker, and he's bored.
00:00:03 By the time this game is all over, he will have kicked 18 extra points.
00:00:06 He bested he made a steak dinner that he can kick a ball through the uprights on a kickoff.
00:00:11 But then he went off himself, and he turns on the jets.
00:00:13 Morris Gouger, while lining up for the catch, smacks into the goal post.
00:00:16 The ball bounces off his head and into Priest's arms.
00:00:19 Jim Priest has just caught his own kickoff for a touchdown.

00:01:13 Boss, I got the opponent's wife in my peripheral. I have them. I have them locked inside it.
00:01:18 I'm ready to pull the trigger whenever the game starts. I'm ready to shoot them,
00:01:23 and then the game will start, and they'll be like, wait, I can't play the game. I have to go.
00:01:25 My wife was fucking blown. Her head was blown off her fucking shoulders.
00:01:29 Stand by for orders, Munchy, and lastly our... We got a reverse JFK situation on our hands here.
00:01:33 Code red, code red. Lastly is our diminutive goalkeeper hypocrite.
00:01:40 Football is an American colloquialism that is just wrong. They just got it wrong,
00:01:45 and they're wrong, and they don't know what they're doing. Also, I love basketball.
00:01:50 Me too, dude. All right, let's go. All right, there you go.
00:02:08 There's our highlight, folks. That's the end, you can believe.
00:02:11 So we're talking about sports today, everybody. We're talking... It's sports center today.
00:02:17 Here we are. Okay, let's settle down and get to our public service announcement from Urban
00:02:24 Dictionary, definition of sports. Okay, here's the top one. I can't fucking wait to hear this.
00:02:30 All right, here's the top one that sucks shit. It's one of those... It's like a dad joke.
00:02:33 Sports, America's state-sponsored religion. All right, let's... Okay, here we go. Here we go.
00:02:41 Number two is sport. So singular, but this is still good. The name your dad calls you
00:02:46 by that makes you feel like a total loser, which you probably are anyway, synonyms, champ, chief,
00:02:53 etc. We're really getting to the bottom of what sports is. I know, we really are. All right,
00:03:01 tell me, who's played sports? Who's been a contender out there on the field? Yeah?
00:03:06 I may not look like it, but when I was a little kid, I was a big sports guy. I used to play soccer
00:03:10 every single day of my fucking life. Soccer? I wouldn't have guessed, okay. You seem like a
00:03:14 football guy to me. American football. The only thing I'm going to be able to say intelligently
00:03:21 is that I like watching football on TV. I like doing it. That's what I know about sports.
00:03:26 I've played soccer a little bit. I used to do baseball. I used to do football. I used to do
00:03:30 all that. I used to do fucking tennis, but now I'm an esports kind of guy. So I'm just going to tell
00:03:36 you about how esports is the fucking future and how I'm a god. That's what I really want to get to
00:03:40 at the end of this. Okay, but let's build up to it. I kind of want to talk about normal sports
00:03:45 as well, mostly. Of course. Because E is gay. E-electronics are gay. We can do another episode
00:03:52 entirely on esports. Believe me, there's a lot to cover there. There's a lot to go into with my
00:03:57 personal investment. What's the future of fucking society? Yeah, I agree. All right, hang on. What
00:04:01 were you saying, Jesse? You know, when I was a little kid, like really young, like five or six
00:04:06 or whatever, I was a sports prodigy. This is true. This is a true story. I could hit the
00:04:13 baseball really far and good. I could throw a hoop from anywhere on the court. I could do like
00:04:20 trick shots, and then I got a Sega, and that was the end. E-sports, dude. Fucking esports.
00:04:27 I threw it all away for esports. It's the worst mistake I ever made. He sacrificed being a blast
00:04:34 down on the field for all that blast processing. I sacrifice being a black
00:04:38 for being a blast person. I was like, I'm not black. I'm OJ. Okay. Okay. Well, what about what
00:04:48 about, what is it? It's like NBA three on three hoops, you know? Or no, it's NBA Jam, like the
00:04:54 greatest sports game ever made. I can do one better Mario, Mario sports, three on three hoops.
00:05:01 That's kind of what was infecting my brain there. I like that game. That's a good one.
00:05:04 That is a good game, because it's got white mage and black mage from Final Fantasy and its
00:05:09 character. What about we esports? What about we esports? The greatest sporting challenge on the
00:05:15 modern console? Weesports is probably like the, I think, isn't that like the most popular game of
00:05:20 all time? It's like number one most popular thing. Yeah, exactly. It's up there anyway. I do like
00:05:26 but I want to talk about real sports. I want to talk about when I was a little boy, because we
00:05:31 are sort of doing that. I was into like sports because you had to be, because you had to do
00:05:37 sports for school. And I was actually very competitive and very, very vicious and I didn't
00:05:43 care about it. You're a competitive guy. You've got that beast inside you. Especially when playing
00:05:49 soccer. I wasn't good at passing. I was never good at like a technical like knowing where to
00:05:53 kick. But I did know that if you kicked people, they would not attack. They would just back off
00:05:59 and I was a perfect defender. So I would go around kicking people to make them cry. And I didn't
00:06:05 care. And that's why I didn't have any friends. But I was such a good defender and nobody would
00:06:09 fucking go anywhere near me. And I felt powerful for the first time. If that was too off the field
00:06:13 too. Oh, that's damn dude. That's effective. Especially also in basketball. I'm a very small
00:06:20 person. I've always been. But in basketball, surprisingly, because of how aggressive and
00:06:25 like I just don't I don't let up. Because I just hate people when I'm playing sports. I just
00:06:30 like I'm your enemy team. You are going to die somehow by my hand. So I would leap up at people
00:06:37 even like the black kids who are like really tall, I would just leap right up with them.
00:06:40 I obviously look really stupid while doing it. But like they, they, you know, people are scared
00:06:45 of how how how seriously I took attacking. I love I love attacking people. Yeah, it's it's
00:06:51 the mental game. I fancied myself. I fancied myself more of a tactician, more of a tactical
00:06:57 player than a physical player in sports. Of course, you know, I played my I played my share of sports
00:07:02 in school. I was in I was in like Little League Baseball or whatever. And like one of my one of
00:07:08 my shittiest childhood memories is there was like a big fucking game or whatever. It was like, oh,
00:07:13 we're gonna were we gonna win the game or lose the game? Who knows? And I was playing in the
00:07:16 outfield and I was bored and I was looking at the sky and I had to pee. And I was like, man,
00:07:21 the game's almost over. I'm just gonna hold it. I'm just gonna hold it until the end of the game
00:07:26 so we can win the game. And then but then time wore on and I just had to pee really bad. And it
00:07:31 started to like hurt. It started to like be physically. And I was and I was like, I can't,
00:07:37 I can't find. So I like ran in and I was like, coach, let me go pee. And he was like fine.
00:07:42 So I went and peed and I came back and we had won the game while I wasn't there.
00:07:46 I was like, oh, man, why did I just go earlier or something? But but on the subject of being a
00:07:52 tactical player, being a sports genius. So one day in gym class, we were playing like soccer or
00:07:58 something. And I was like, I know I can't compete. I know I can't compete with these bullies with
00:08:02 these bullies and trolls and jocks and chads, physically, but I can't compete with their brute
00:08:07 strength. But my mind, my mind is sharp like a like a like a whetstone. My mind is keen like a
00:08:13 blade stones aren't sharp you. So I so I so I I engineered what I called the reverse sneak attack.
00:08:23 Wait, which is actually the exact opposite of a sneak attack, because you
00:08:29 loudly announce that you are performing a sneak attack while simultaneously not performing a sneak
00:08:35 attack. So I was just dribbling up the field and a defender and a defender just came up to me
00:08:40 just trying to you know, just being do you know the internet bully and troll just trying to
00:08:44 just trying to take the ball from me like a normal idiot doesn't he isn't seeing like a brilliant
00:08:48 strategy coming his way. And he says he's coming up to me. I just yell in his face as loud as I
00:08:52 can sneak attack. And then I just kicked the ball past him. And he was too dumbfounded. He was too
00:08:59 dumbfounded to do a thing. What I'm saying is the plan worked perfectly and I broke sports forever.
00:09:06 Actually, that technique was banned in professional sports because it was too powerful.
00:09:10 Is that true? Wow, Ben, you're the coolest. Yeah, good story, Ben. I definitely heard all of it.
00:09:15 I didn't leave and then just hear the end of it. Me neither. Let me tell you, Ben, I've had to
00:09:21 I've had to contend with some IRL cyber bullies a few times myself on the on the field of battle.
00:09:26 Let me tell you about one day in the life of a young boy where he transcended humanity and became
00:09:32 a literal sports guide. Okay. So this was in middle school sometime and we were playing this
00:09:37 game called poison ball poison ball. It's a dodgeball type game. But instead of having people
00:09:42 like restricted to to either side of the field, there are actually there is two active balls at
00:09:47 any time. And basically the entire field is in place so you can run around anywhere and just
00:09:53 tag people. And the way it works is like just the two balls sort of act as like opposing magnets
00:09:59 and like where one is basically what you do is you go to where the ball isn't if you've got one
00:10:03 and you just pick off weak people one at a time on the fringes. And eventually it works down to
00:10:07 there's just two people each with the ball and they just matrix duel each other and try to like
00:10:11 fake each other out and shit. Okay. So on an average gym class day, we play this during gym
00:10:15 class, of course, on an average gym day, you could get around four of those games in. Let me tell
00:10:20 you on this one day, something happened deep down in my brain's dick. And I became the god. I was
00:10:28 a I would I had watched the matrix recently. So I'd internalize their their mad skills. My dodging
00:10:33 game was insane. I won three out of four of those games. And I only lost the fourth one. And remember
00:10:39 this is everyone against everyone. There's like there's like 30 people in this class. All right.
00:10:45 I trounced them all. I defeated them all. The only reason I lost the last game was because the two
00:10:50 people who got the ball at the very start of the game before I had a chance to get my hands on it,
00:10:54 because I would have turned the tide. They both they grabbed the balls, they looked each other,
00:10:57 they nodded, and they both marched over to the corner where I was. And like a fucking hero,
00:11:02 I just stood them in the I looked in the I said, just do it. Just do it, you fucking cowards.
00:11:07 You can't handle me and my best. You don't deserve me at my worst. That's what I said to them. And
00:11:13 then they put me down. They was like the end of Braveheart. They put me down because they knew I
00:11:17 was too fucking powerful. If I'd won one more game, I would have literally floated like a god
00:11:23 into the heavens. And and life would never have that those jealous bullies just wouldn't just
00:11:28 wouldn't allow that. This is this is this is them dragging down all of humanity's evolution. It was
00:11:34 like it was like in 2001 space Odyssey. I was that baby in space. And they just they pulled me,
00:11:40 they put their hooks in me. They pulled me back down to earth. And they devolved me back into
00:11:45 a lowly human being once again. That's what happened. But I'll never forget that day. I'll
00:11:49 never forget that day. Jesus Christ. There was the assassination of Julius Caesar, like everyone's
00:11:54 conspiring against him because he was just too fucking powerful. Exactly. Exactly. It was exactly
00:11:59 like that. I have something similar, but it was more like it was more like me sering my dominance
00:12:05 and then everyone like deciding that I should be eliminated a little bit. Okay. So we were playing
00:12:11 soccer. I was playing soccer like happened to Hillary in the election. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
00:12:16 We were playing soccer and these fucking these these fucking these fucking cowards and these
00:12:20 these children were just trying up not playing the game correctly. And there was being believe
00:12:24 they were breaking the fucking rules. And then I was I was going to allow them to fucking sully
00:12:29 the name of soccer. And so I kept I kept fucking walking over them and like saying if you don't
00:12:33 play the game right, I'm going to fucking like kill you. I'm going to destroy you and your family.
00:12:37 But they they just they just fucking wouldn't they just they just wouldn't and I forgot the
00:12:42 exact move is one of them got it and then like and like fucking like like like somehow like
00:12:48 like like they had like fucking like picked it up and then like moved it or something something
00:12:52 fucking so like obviously like breaking the fucking rules that it had to be dealt with.
00:12:57 So when they kicked it, I jumped and thrown the fucking ball, I caught it in midair,
00:13:01 slammed on the ground like like held the ball to my chest and I screamed the word hell and this
00:13:06 was in fifth grade. And so everyone's eyes like locked on me instantaneously because I said a
00:13:11 swear word. And then I made like I made like a big old speech about how these people need to be
00:13:15 fucking driven from our lands because they do not respect the sport and they must be fucking
00:13:19 eliminated because they do not they do not appreciate the craftsmanship that it has to go in
00:13:24 to creating sports rules. And so I just held the ball I just held the ball in my fucking hands
00:13:28 and let anyone take it until the until they were marched off in shame and everyone like booed them.
00:13:33 Yes, actually, justice won this day. Yeah. By the way, can I just can I just also share a
00:13:38 quick story about the word hell specifically? Just just one time in third this is in third grade.
00:13:44 I was talking to a friend we were we had just read anamorphs. All right, he had read volume one of
00:13:48 anamorphs and I was going to read it that night hadn't gotten to it yet. And when he said the
00:13:52 name of the character Chapman, who I believe was the principal in the book, I say vice vice
00:13:56 principal Chapman that you're exactly right. Vice principal Chapman. I said this exact word
00:14:00 to this exact inflection. Who the hell is Chapman? That's exactly what I said. And they
00:14:09 immediately were like, Nate, what have you done? They pulled me aside. They called my parents and
00:14:14 had them come pick me up because I was disrupting class by being a monster a little swearing monster
00:14:19 while in the most tortured way possible. Yeah, I just wanted to be cool so bad. Stunning.
00:14:26 Yeah, so funny to me because like, hell isn't even a thing like I know it's not even a swear,
00:14:32 but not only that, but I remember like a like a little kid. I think it was like, like, seven or
00:14:38 10 or something like really young. And he got in trouble for saying fuck. And all the that happened
00:14:44 was the teacher yelled at him and made him like feel bad in front of like a class of older kids
00:14:49 like it was like he said fuck. And he got in trouble and he got shouted at and humiliated
00:14:55 in front of another class. And that was it. It wasn't like calling parents fucking parents and
00:15:00 shit. They made it a federal fucking case. That sounds like much more justice than than Nate got
00:15:07 the poor bastard. It's true. One time I was tricked into flipping someone off and then they got me
00:15:11 in trouble. Were they playing a mimic game or something? No, I remember. I remember somebody
00:15:18 telling me to do that and I didn't know what it was and I got in trouble. Yeah, that's what happened.
00:15:23 This fucking stupid, this fucking like like like virgin for life fucking like like twig
00:15:30 like football star. Fuck him. Daniel, Daniel, if you are fucking listening this, I'm I never
00:15:35 forgot about you and you will be fucking eliminated. You know, you know Daniel's listening. Yeah.
00:15:41 I know Daniel is just seething with jealousy.
00:15:46 That you became a member of the PCP and he was left to flounder. He was left to flounder in his
00:15:51 pathetic sports stardom. And this is what you fucking deserved, you stupid piece of shit. You
00:15:57 know why? Because in third grade, I was sitting next to you and you said, Hey dude, check this out.
00:16:02 And like, like, like, like, okay, okay, put up, put out your fucking hand and then lower all of
00:16:07 like, like, pull your entire like, like, make it like a fist, but then have your middle finger be
00:16:11 out. Just, just, just try dude. Wouldn't it be funny if that happened? Wouldn't that be fucking
00:16:16 Larry? So you did that one day? Wouldn't that be interesting? And then I'd be like, yeah,
00:16:22 dude, that'd be really fucking funny, dude. And then I did it. And then he was like, Hey,
00:16:27 teacher, look what Anthony's doing. I was fucking pummeled. I was beat in the fucking street. I was,
00:16:34 I was pulled aside. I was putting like a will or one like, like, like abandoning your post,
00:16:39 like like firing squad, blindfolded, fucking executed in front of my entire class.
00:16:44 They really brought the horrible, whorey hammer of the gods down.
00:16:50 And I'll never fucking forgive you, Daniel, Daniel, ever, ever. You and your fucking yacht club.
00:16:55 Just because you, just because you can fucking, you can count better. Just because you fucking
00:17:00 read Harry Potter while I was reading Diary Wimpy Kid, doesn't mean you're fucking better than me.
00:17:04 All right. It doesn't fucking mean anything. I got aside with Daniel on that one, but you know.
00:17:14 You fucking bastard, you fucking traitor, you fucking broodist.
00:17:18 Yeah, I've been looking for a chance. I've been looking for a chance to betray him.
00:17:22 Okay, let's, let's refocus on sports, I guess. What do we got here? What do you got to say?
00:17:29 All right. I want to talk about sports I like, because I do like watching a few sports,
00:17:34 not the biggest, biggest ones, but I like watching Wimbledon when that's on. And the Olympics is
00:17:38 always kind of interesting. And, you know, horse racing, stuff like that, stuff that's not,
00:17:42 not like the most popular. Horse racing? Horse racing, I believe.
00:17:46 Well, the Grand National specifically, it's like, it's like the big horse race of the year.
00:17:52 And they've never even seen a horse. Is that like NASCAR for horses? Is that the idea?
00:17:56 It's like when they get all the smallest people and all the biggest horses and they just put
00:18:00 them together and see what happens. Okay, all right. And let me tell you, there's some chemistry
00:18:05 out there. Yeah, okay. But I have not watched a sport. I have not watched a sport in years. Like,
00:18:10 I watched the Super Bowl maybe like several years ago, just on a lark, just as a joke,
00:18:15 just ironically, I watched the Super Bowl. And that was pretty much the end. I have not watched
00:18:19 the Olympics. I can't, people, people act like I'm weird because I'm not watching the Olympics.
00:18:23 Like, I feel like I'm supposed to be watching the Olympics, but I'm like, I can't imagine a thing
00:18:27 worse. I can't imagine a worse fate than watching the Olympics. It's kind of nice to just have it on
00:18:31 in the TV, on some TV nearby. Then you feel watching the Olympic girls do the gymnastics is
00:18:38 more sexy than having actual sex. It's the only attractive thing in the world. I gotta give a
00:18:44 shout out, I gotta give a shout out to the women's volleyball team. The volleyball team is the perfect
00:18:48 mixture of like, they wear the least clothing and they're doing the most active activities.
00:18:52 It's the best. Volleyball, that's the way to go. These are like fucking, these are like fucking,
00:18:56 like, buff, like athletes. These are, these are the kind of girls that played softball in college.
00:19:01 But dude, compared to American fatties, they're a thousand times better. There could be no
00:19:06 comparison. I don't, whatever, whatever, man. I'm committing. I'm not, I'm committing. I'm not
00:19:11 feeling it. You know, I, that's a, that's a growing sentiment, I think. People just being like,
00:19:15 bored of the, the, oh, oh, fucking curling semi-finals is up. Just watch it. Yeah, I don't know. Like,
00:19:21 there's a lot of shit. I can't keep track of it all. I kind of like it the way Gib does, I guess.
00:19:25 Just watching it in the background, like, oh, yeah. I guess like, when, yeah, yeah, I'm totally,
00:19:31 so in other words, put it on and don't watch it, which is something that I could probably
00:19:34 have a great time doing. Yeah, because like, because like, whenever there's like a big thing,
00:19:38 when there's like the ashes, which is like the, the cricket tournament between Australia and England,
00:19:44 there's like, the, there's Wimbledon, which is obviously the biggest tennis tournament in the
00:19:47 world, like something big, but like, I don't care. But I'll watch the final and I'll be like,
00:19:53 glancing at the TV because other people are watching it. It's just sort of nice to know that
00:19:56 it's a thing that's being talked about. It's just like, oh yeah, you know, I know what's going on.
00:20:01 You know, Gib, I have never felt a bigger cultural divide between us than I do right now with these,
00:20:05 this, the ashes, I, all right, here's the thing about the ashes. Cricket is a, is a big English
00:20:12 thing and it's also big in Australia and there's a big fierce rivalry. There's, there's other like
00:20:19 actual cricket tournaments that go on. I think, I think, yeah, the ashes is just England and Australia
00:20:24 or maybe it's everyone, I forget. But the thing is the ashes is like, it's literally a thing of
00:20:30 ashes, which is the trophy because of something that happened a long time ago and I can't remember.
00:20:35 I was going to say, do they burn the losing teams and then they become the ashes?
00:20:38 Wait, I remember, I remember from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the ashes is like a wood,
00:20:44 like an ancient wooden artifact that was burned and like, yeah, yeah, there's some,
00:20:48 the ashes are like a thing in Hitchhiker's Guide and like the third, like the third book.
00:20:52 It's a, sorry. That's important. Yeah, yeah. Anyone who knows what I'm talking about, comment
00:20:57 and remind me. Might be related, yes. But um, yeah, there's that, uh, fucking,
00:21:04 my, I don't know, this is totally a tangent, but my, uh, my neighbors,
00:21:09 I'm trying to think of like culturally divided, divided things. Like,
00:21:12 rugby is like the coolest, rugby is like the coolest sport in the world and anyone who does it
00:21:16 is like 10 times more of a badass because like there's no padding and it's super cool and they
00:21:20 just run at each other for like an hour and they all die. They are the, the big rugby thing is called
00:21:26 the five nations because it's like, it's England, it's Wales, Scotland, uh, France and Ireland,
00:21:33 I think, and they're all like, they're all big fat, tough, all well-known independent nations,
00:21:38 Wales, Scotland. No, they're all just, they're big rugby people and they're all nearby and they're
00:21:43 just like, we fucking love rugby and eating meat and being big, beefy guys and we want to beat the
00:21:48 shit out of each other with a ball. Why don't you guys invite France to play sometime? That'd be nice.
00:21:54 We did. That's why I said the France is part of it. Oh. Oh no. The five nations you
00:22:00 fuck. Okay, all right. But yeah, like, the cool thing about watching a rugby match is that people,
00:22:07 it's like the same sort of size as a soccer match, but the crowd is so, so quiet and so respectful.
00:22:14 It's like, it's more nowadays, it's, yeah, it's, it's more quiet than a fucking golf match,
00:22:20 sometimes a rugby match. When something's really, like, you know, they don't do stupid
00:22:25 chants, they don't do screaming constantly, it's just like, oh yeah, yeah, we're watching a thing.
00:22:32 Fuck my asshole, fuck my asshole, let's go. It feels the, the manliest sort of thing ever.
00:22:38 I like it. I mean, I do like, uh, when I go to a sporting event, I like to be able to take it seriously
00:22:44 what's happening on the field and sometimes, like, a lot of people I've noticed go to like
00:22:48 football games just for like the experience of going and, you know, buying the beer and getting
00:22:52 the food and stuff. But at a certain point, I do want to be able to pay attention to the actual
00:22:56 game and be interested in what's happening down there. I mean, like, I go to football games
00:23:01 more than anything else, which is to say, like, I've been to one in the last year. Uh, so that's,
00:23:06 that's pretty fun. That's pretty fun. I, I, a while, when I was a little kid, I used to like, like,
00:23:12 like maybe like three or four times I went to the baseball stadium near my house, specifically
00:23:19 because I liked their brand of pizza, like the best. So I, so I went there just to eat pizza
00:23:25 and then like, I would see like, oh, there's a buy ticket to get it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:23:29 Well, okay. Yeah. Yeah. And so that was cool. And I had like, like every time I did it. So yeah,
00:23:35 I was just popping against the pizza. Then I realized, but baseball takes like fucking a year.
00:23:40 Like it is the longest sport ever made. And it was, I have been to like two or three baseball
00:23:47 games in my life and never, ever have I enjoyed baseball. Yeah, baseball is pretty boring. Not
00:23:54 a big fan. I think baseball is like the coolest sport, but not one that I ever want to watch.
00:24:01 Like I think, I think that all sports are great and I love them all. I just don't want to watch any
00:24:05 of them. I think that's the thing about baseball, I feel like baseball generates just an absolutely
00:24:11 outrageous amount of like numbers and statistics to analyze. Like I feel like baseball is like,
00:24:17 people just do that. I feel like baseball is like analyzed, maybe like proportionally more
00:24:22 than other sports. I agree. And I don't know why that is. I mean, I'm sure you said maybe basketball.
00:24:28 I mean, I hear a lot of people talking stats with basketball too. I feel like the biggest
00:24:32 sports nerds are baseball nerds. I agree. I agree. Moneyball was a good movie.
00:24:39 I was just, so I was just, all right, so I just put out a video about 17776.
00:24:46 Oh, here we go with the shilling your videos. No, no, no, I'm not saying this to show my video.
00:24:50 I'm saying that like the guy who made that is like a big like sports nerd stats analysis guy.
00:24:56 And I, and I like looked into his work and I went and I watched a bunch of his old
00:25:00 videos. Well, they're not even, they're like a year old. And just going into some like
00:25:04 weird sports happening and his name is John Boyce. And some of them were really fucking
00:25:09 fascinating. He takes one where he looks at Barry Bond's batting average and he says,
00:25:14 okay, this is so fucking good. How and like a lot of his batting average is high because people
00:25:20 just deliberately walk in because they were so scared of having him hit the ball. And so he's
00:25:24 like, how good would he have been if he had not even had a bat, if he had never swung in a pitch?
00:25:29 And like he, he did this to the stats analysis and he was still the best hitter in the league
00:25:34 by a mile, even if he never swung. And there was, there was another one. There was like an old
00:25:39 game in like 1916 that ended in like a score of two, a football game that was 222 to zero.
00:25:47 And he just like walks through the whole game and just be like, absolute incompetence and like,
00:25:52 like wild, wild dogs chased the players in the middle of the game. Yeah, there was, there was
00:26:00 the first play of the game, the losing teams of quarterback got like knocked the fuck out.
00:26:05 The halfway through the game, they brought him back in clearly with a concussion, but like they
00:26:10 brought him in, they snapped the ball, it hit him with in the face and he just, there was, okay,
00:26:14 there was a kicker who kicked the ball and it flew across the field, hit a defender on the helmet,
00:26:20 and then the kicker caught his own kick off of the defender's helmet and scored a touchdown with it.
00:26:27 There was, there was a guy, there was a guy who was just there to impress his, it was a college
00:26:31 game. There was a guy who like, he got the ball, he wasn't there to actually play, he was just
00:26:37 impresses professors, he didn't know what to do, he like throws the ball, runs off the field,
00:26:42 hides behind a fence, but there are, no, no, it gets better, but they're all ready because he was
00:26:47 scared. There were already, no, no, listen, there were already two other players hiding behind the
00:26:56 fence, and, and, and they don't want him to give away their hiding spot, so they throw him back
00:27:02 over the fence onto the field. What the fuck? Okay, all right, so like this, this is some pretty
00:27:11 hot shit, and um, yeah, so sports, so sports, I was watching this and I remembered, I remembered
00:27:16 that sports can be cool. He's just filled with abject terror. Like he tries to escape in the
00:27:26 future. All right, that's the coolest thing I've ever heard. Yeah, I highly recommend, uh, yeah,
00:27:32 that video. What's that guy's channel called again? It's John Voice. Right, okay. Yeah, yeah, and,
00:27:38 and the video is called 222-0. I will definitely watch that, but I was gonna say, what I, the
00:27:44 thing about me in sports is the, the best thing about sports, I do like watching football because
00:27:49 I think the game is fun, and I understand it pretty well, and I like to watch guys, and I root for
00:27:53 the Patriots. I'm a Patriots fan, um, and, and they're the fucking dominating team all the time,
00:27:58 so it's fun to watch your team win, so that's nice. Uh, uh, plus I grew up, you know, close to
00:28:02 Boston, so whatever, I don't make fucking excuses for this. Uh, uh, uh, plus my friend John likes
00:28:07 the Eagles and they always lose, which is really nice, but anyway, what I'm getting to is that my
00:28:12 favorite type of sports are the ones that make the players look the most attractive. So I'm talking
00:28:17 about, that's right, that's right, I'm talking about weightlifting specifically, like, like
00:28:21 powerlifting. Powerlifting guys actually get a little fat though. Yeah, powerlifting guys are
00:28:25 way fat, they're all bare-foot. The best sport, the best sport is competitive bodybuilding,
00:28:31 going on a stage, and flexing your muscles, and showing how cool you are. No, if you think those
00:28:36 guys look cool or good, you're fucked up. They do look good. They don't look, they don't even look
00:28:42 they're heroes. They don't. Yeah. Well, silly. They do look really silly. I would say I'm a bit of
00:28:48 like a traditional bodybuilder enthusiast, if anything, like, uh, like, like Frank Zane back
00:28:53 of it, like before, before, uh, uh, you know, fucking steroids were just like, you know, defined
00:28:58 everything, even though like guys like Arnold, like are, are beautiful and they're on steroids.
00:29:02 All right. Uh, Arnold is like, yes, like, I understand that. I've seen some bodybuilders
00:29:08 that go so over the top that they literally look like a fucking mutant zombie bitch. Yeah,
00:29:14 I'm not into that as much. You know what's funny about those guys is that, you know, they, they
00:29:18 work out, they make every part of their body humongous. What's coming next, but there's no
00:29:24 weightlifting to make your wiener bigger. So they're standing there in their underpants and these
00:29:29 little like G strings and their whole bodies are huge, but it just makes it look like they've got
00:29:33 little tiny wieners. Yeah, true. And their heads look small too by comparison. They, you can't do
00:29:38 anything about either of those. That's why you should never work out ever. They ought to, they
00:29:42 ought to make them take your pants off and judge who has the tiniest wiener and give that guy the
00:29:47 golden. Yeah, guys, there's nothing to do but just to, just to take off our pants and just,
00:29:52 you just got to do it. There's, there's nothing else we can possibly just have to do it naked,
00:29:56 guys. They should just have the who has the tiniest wiener competition. Oh, and also they're
00:30:00 all really big and muscly for some reason. Well, you know what it is? I kind of, I wonder sometimes
00:30:06 why is there not a biggest dick competition? I'm serious. I'm serious. I'm dead serious. It's,
00:30:12 it's so important, right? Like culturally, like having a big dick is so important. And yet there's
00:30:18 no big dick contest. And I understand that it's not much of a contest because someone would just,
00:30:24 someone just has the biggest dick, right? The same guy would win every year.
00:30:30 But like, they do that with like dog shows, right? Like dog shows, like they just show up and like
00:30:35 whoever's got the best dog wins. Wait, maybe you have to train the dog. You can't train your penis
00:30:40 to be larger. You can do some tricks with your dick. Like cock pushups, for example, you know,
00:30:45 yeah, you got a jelk. They're a tick, you know, I'm on board. I'm ready to sign up for this thing.
00:30:50 I thought there was already like a world record, largest dick.
00:30:56 It's, it's, I've like, okay, this is real gay, but I've looked into like I've tried to find like
00:31:00 video evidence of like the biggest dick and you can't like there is none. Like there's like rumors
00:31:05 and theories. I know exactly what you're talking about because I've looked it up too for scientific
00:31:09 purposes. You look up like who has the biggest winner. The guy who has it will show up, but
00:31:13 they won't actually show you it. Yeah, yeah, Jonah Falcon supposedly has a 13.5 inch dick,
00:31:18 but there's no fucking evidence of it. Like, are you fucking kidding me? Because, because all
00:31:22 the pictures have him like with like a sock over it or like, you know, you know what I'm talking
00:31:25 about? It's just because he has a really small body makes it look bigger. Well, this is like,
00:31:30 if you guys are talking about the same guy I'm talking about, this is like an average looking
00:31:33 dude, but he's got this monster cock that actually causes him, you know, a lot of like, it's like,
00:31:36 it's huge. It's like a problem that is so big. Yeah, I was just about to say is his name Mike Mate.
00:31:41 No, it's not Mike Mate. It's some other guy. I mean, it's just fucking, it's just fucking
00:31:45 ridiculous to me that like, there are like, it's so important. Like we talk about having,
00:31:49 we talk about big dicks like so much in our society. And they're just like, you try to find like,
00:31:55 okay, well, like show me, like show me like a 12 inch dick, like with a fucking ruler next to it,
00:32:00 to prove it. And you cannot find it, even though supposedly they're out there. All you can do is
00:32:05 look at porn. I guess that's like the biggest reason. It's all like, it's all like weird camera
00:32:09 angles and like, I just want to know for sure. Like, I just want to see it like laid out performance
00:32:15 so I can be like, Oh, so, so, so that's what it's like. So that's what's out there. But there's
00:32:19 no taboo. There's no fucking cultural taboos. That's why I wonder. That's why I wonder about that.
00:32:24 You know, it's bizarre. I find it bizarre. I'm with you. I'm with you. You probably have to go
00:32:28 in person and us to see it. Well, then he'll show you. Let's go. Hippo come. Well, let's go on an
00:32:35 adventure. Hell yeah. Yeah, we club. I'm ready. The reason I start a vlog series, Hippo and Ben's
00:32:44 quest for the biggest dick. That sounds like a rowdy fucker's cop. You know, yeah, that's a road
00:32:51 trip. So the reason I brought a bodybuilding in general is because I actually do do bodybuilding
00:32:57 myself, you know, as best I can. And I would consider myself a sport guy in that three times a
00:33:03 week I go and exercise and then go running sometimes. So it's not really a sport. It's just
00:33:08 like a training thing. It's just a separate category. That's just exercise. If you're not
00:33:12 competing, it's not a sport. You know, I guess that's fair. I guess that's fair. I'm competing
00:33:16 with myself. I always try to do my best. My favorite sport is gaming this YouTube system.
00:33:26 Oh, that's a good one. I'm not very good at it yet, though. No. I always lose. YouTube is the
00:33:34 ultimate eSports competition. It is. What about eSports? That's the greatest admission of all time.
00:33:40 What do you got about eSports, Manchu? Let's hear it. I love eSports because I can do it without
00:33:45 any work because video games are easy and you're pathetic if you play in them. But have you tried
00:33:50 getting into League of Legends? That's like a month-long endeavor to even understand the gist
00:33:56 of the game and all the fucking games and shit. Honestly, as games, there's nothing I detest more
00:34:01 than MOBAs and eSports. I've watched a few eSports. Mostly because I know the person who
00:34:13 was commentating them was a person I follow. I was like, okay, I'll have a look at this.
00:34:18 It was like StarCraft II, which I got the gist of pretty quick because I know what an RTS is.
00:34:23 It's like, whoa, they're clicking so fast. There are so many fucking shortcuts and clicking,
00:34:29 and moving stuff. It's pretty interesting. I couldn't watch a whole tournament, but that's
00:34:33 alright. The other one was Hearthstone, which is a game that I had played. I don't play anymore,
00:34:39 but I was really into it. That was the most potential you could actually be good at Hearthstone
00:34:48 because all you need is to play the game a lot. I've heard it's really random, though. I've heard
00:34:54 there's a lot of randomization. That's why I feel like I could do it. If I just get lucky,
00:34:59 I just say, oh yeah, I got the card I need, and they didn't. Similar to Hearthstone, I was a pretty
00:35:04 active follower of Magic the Gathering in general back in the day. For a time, I tried to keep up
00:35:10 with professional strats and know what people were up to. This was in college sometime, and I went
00:35:15 to like some tournaments and stuff and just tried my hand at it. I had friends who were far more
00:35:18 professional. I had a friend, actually, who was like a judge. He was a higher level guy. He had
00:35:25 gotten to a place where he could do consistently as well in tournaments enough to make. Because
00:35:30 when you win tournaments, if you're the grand prize winner, you get money. But if you just win
00:35:35 in general, you get a certain amount of the rarer cards from the pool. He was able to get to a
00:35:40 place where he could win enough that he could sell those cards and completely cover all his entry
00:35:44 fees and his transportation costs and shit. He just loved Magic, so it was the perfect
00:35:50 situation for him, and he was only getting better. I don't know what happened to that guy, but that
00:35:54 was that. That was my experience. I would say that esports in general is fine. Things like
00:35:59 competitive Counter Strike are kind of fun to watch, but they all pale in comparison to my
00:36:05 actual favorite type of esports. I would call this a sport, and that is speedrunning in general.
00:36:11 Speedrunning is the coolest. No, it's the best. It's the best. I love it so much. I like speedruns.
00:36:16 I love watching speedruns. I'm the biggest fan in the world of speedruns. Every GDQ is my birthday.
00:36:22 It's great. Well, before we get started talking about speedruns, I just want to say
00:36:26 SalTV, S-A-L-T-V. He commentates TF2 competitive. Some of that shit is really fun to watch
00:36:34 if you like TF2. Are you sure his name isn't Salt-V? No, S-A-L-T-V or something like that.
00:36:41 I used to watch his videos. He hasn't made one in a while, but they're kind of fun to look back at
00:36:46 to see a commentated TF2 competitive 6v6. To explain my background of esports real quick,
00:36:52 I watch esports all the time. I would say every week, if not more, which is more than I play
00:37:00 actual video games. I mainly follow Smash, all the games, and most FPSs. Right now, Overwatch is
00:37:09 big, so I'm watching that even though I'm not the biggest fan of Overwatch. In any FPS, I enjoy
00:37:14 greatly. I fucking love Smash. I know everything about Smash is the greatest game of all time,
00:37:19 and it's the... excuse me. That's actually a party game. Yeah, it's not a fighting game.
00:37:27 It's not really a fighting game, actually. It's a Republican party game. It has more fucking
00:37:33 inputs than anything else in the entire world. It's just a baby game, dude. It's just a baby game.
00:37:39 Now he's mad. Listen to the anger in that laugh. The closest thing to esports ID would be playing
00:37:47 Pokemon Showdown. I've always kind of wanted to compete in a tournament. I kind of don't even
00:37:56 know how to get started with it, but whatever. I would have no problem showing up and just losing,
00:38:02 but I would just kind of like to do it just to do it. Yeah, sounds fun. It's great because it's so
00:38:07 accessible. There are so many games you can play and go esports, and it's so accessible and easy to
00:38:13 do. Obviously, the high level is super resource-intensive and stuff. You have a great computer
00:38:19 and it'd be all technical and with your hands and shit, but in TF2, you can just fucking boot up
00:38:26 and then play for a little while and then go into competitive mode and fucking play, and it's great
00:38:30 and it's fun. Not the Valve competitive mode. You can do the fan shit because the Valve one
00:38:35 sucks. You know what I mean, though. It's super easy to go competitive with games, and I love them
00:38:40 all, and it's great. And you get Mad Dosh. And if you're lucky enough and you play Overwatch,
00:38:48 so you can get on TBS right after a Seinfeld episode, you can watch the TBS tournament.
00:38:53 I can watch Seinfeld and then Overwatch on TBS. Oh my god, it's the perfect combination. They go
00:39:00 together. You make so much fucking Mad Dosh playing Overwatch that frankly, you can't afford,
00:39:07 you, the viewer, cannot afford not to buy Overwatch right now. You could be raking in the
00:39:12 dough as a competitive, multi-shooter bullshit game, worst game in the world. You could be
00:39:19 collecting, you could be making dividends, and here you sit listening to me for shame.
00:39:25 The globalist conspiracy directly prints money from the Federal Reserve and distributes it to
00:39:30 Overwatch players, flooding the world economy with worthless US dollars, inevitably drying us
00:39:35 off of the poverty. We live in a post-scarcity world. We live in an Overwatch-based economy now.
00:39:43 We're going to move on from a petrol-based dollar, no more petrol dollars, it's now Overwatch
00:39:47 dollars, where the US dollars are completely comprised on Overwatch points, and that determines
00:39:52 your pay. What were you saying? I want to talk about that, because Overwatch is such a huge game,
00:39:58 and I have no desire to play it, but the amount of, like, if you want to get big at streaming,
00:40:04 you play Overwatch, because it's the big thing. If you want to, you know, to get, like, if I was
00:40:08 playing Overwatch instead of Minecraft, I mean, Minecraft is pretty big, but I would be getting,
00:40:13 like, so many new followers constantly, and it doesn't matter how good I am. Well, actually,
00:40:17 it probably does. But, like, it's like, it's a game, and you're supposed to play it to have fun,
00:40:23 but there are so many benefits to playing it, like, for an audience, like, monetarily, that I feel
00:40:30 some sort of, like, some pulling in the direction of playing it, even though I don't like it.
00:40:35 Here's what I think about that. I think when you're playing a game, like, super competitively,
00:40:40 like, eventually, you understand the game so well that you stop even seeing the game, and you become,
00:40:45 like, Neo in the Matrix, just seeing the ones and zeros. Like, it all becomes fucking code to you.
00:40:50 So I kind of think, to that extent, it almost doesn't matter what game you play, because eventually,
00:40:54 you'll reach an understanding where you've just, like, gone beyond what the game is even supposed
00:40:58 to be, and it just becomes, like, crunching numbers in your head and doing that. So it probably
00:41:05 doesn't matter to, like, a high-level player what game they're even playing.
00:41:08 There should be an eSports for Undertale, and the contest is just,
00:41:14 the winner is whoever doesn't do Skeletor as Papyrus.
00:41:18 The winner is whoever has the best time and has the best friendships at the end, whoever enjoys it the most.
00:41:37 What's funny about the way you say that is, like, you're framing it like, you know, to make Undertale,
00:41:41 like, a competitive thing, but that's exactly what speedrunning does. It makes any game into a
00:41:46 competitive thing where it's about optimization and strategy, and I love that.
00:41:49 It's a single-player game, and that means it's gay.
00:41:52 It does make it feel sad, though. That's bullshit. It's still competitive. What are you talking about?
00:41:56 The thing that I like about speedruns is that, like, you'll take a game that might take, like,
00:42:01 weeks to beat, like, I don't know, Mario 64 or something, and you watch a speedrun that's,
00:42:05 like, I don't know, beat it in, like, two hours. And what that basically does is take the entire
00:42:09 experience of playing a game and compress it down to, like, movie length, or, like, show length.
00:42:14 So you can, like, experience the entire game in, like, you know, in, like, a digestible
00:42:18 formula. You can sit down, and an hour later, you've watched someone play, you know, the entirety of
00:42:24 Banjo-Kazooie, and you're like, yeah, that was a good hour.
00:42:26 You know, Ben, I experienced Banjo-Kazooie.
00:42:30 I agree that that has a certain appeal to it, but I would say that, like, a lot of what you
00:42:34 end up doing is, like, skipping content. Like, if you can skip content in a speedrun, you skip
00:42:38 that content. Like, that's what you want to do.
00:42:39 Well, that's why you watch specific, like, hundreds of games.
00:42:40 Depends on the cent runs.
00:42:42 Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100% runs.
00:42:43 Oh, you know, that's true.
00:42:45 Some of them.
00:42:45 Yeah, that is true.
00:42:46 I just watched a Mario 64 one the other day that was really good. It was, like, two hours.
00:42:50 Just the parkouring was incredible.
00:42:52 It was just, it was just breath, yeah, yeah, it's breathtaking.
00:42:55 I've been getting, I got into this guy recently who's been doing a really good service of making
00:43:01 videos detailing the legacy of the progression of speedrunning world records for various games.
00:43:09 And when it started, like, when people started speedrunning it and how, you know, over time,
00:43:14 people have figured out techniques to make it go lower, the time go lower and lower.
00:43:18 And it's really interesting and really well put together, sort of, like, just instruction,
00:43:22 like, like, like a history, sort of a timeline.
00:43:25 Those are fascinating.
00:43:26 The guy's name is Summoning Salt, if you type that in, you should find it.
00:43:31 Speedrunners talk about, like, when they discover a new technique or, like, a new strategy that
00:43:36 cuts their time down.
00:43:37 They talk about it like, new tech was discovered.
00:43:40 Like, a new technology is created.
00:43:42 There's so much hype.
00:43:43 I love it.
00:43:44 It's great.
00:43:44 Yeah.
00:43:45 And I love all the, like, when you, exactly, exactly, that kind of, that kind of, like,
00:43:51 putting on a pedestal, it's like, it's like giving a little pomp and circumstance to, like,
00:43:55 these kind of, like, these sort of mundane things that you find.
00:43:59 And, like, you build a whole community around those things and everyone's, like, in on the
00:44:02 joke and you can get in on it, too, and be, like, a member of a community and understand
00:44:06 these things.
00:44:06 It's so cool.
00:44:07 I really love it.
00:44:08 It's like, it's like, it's like this cliff here, yeah, the way, the way that I'm about to,
00:44:11 like, you know, do, like, a high jump, backflip, wall kick right here and, like,
00:44:15 glitch through the wall, like, this, like, this technique was in development for months
00:44:19 and it finally paid off, you know?
00:44:22 Like, it was experimented with.
00:44:24 The way that people, like, know that there's, like, a choke point coming up where, like,
00:44:28 oh, this is where I make a break, like, if I fuck this up, like, I lose five minutes off
00:44:31 my time here, I go and they do it and everyone's, like, yeah, I fucking did it.
00:44:35 I really like the community aspect.
00:44:36 I was, I was watching, I was watching a Pokemon speedrun.
00:44:39 I don't remember what Jen, but Worcester was speedrunning and there comes a point where,
00:44:44 because Worcester's making, he's making all these strategic decisions that are going to
00:44:47 save him time later.
00:44:49 And then, like, he's having a fight and, like, he gets, like, it gets low and then he gets
00:44:53 a crit and he wins, he wins the fight when he wasn't, and the crowd goes crazy and cheers
00:44:58 and Worcester is, like, visibly annoyed.
00:44:59 He's, like, really?
00:45:00 You cheer for that?
00:45:02 You cheer for that completely random thing that I had no control over and you don't even
00:45:06 notice, like, all these things that I put months of research into?
00:45:09 Like, he says it, too, and, like, the look on his face is, like, really pissed off.
00:45:12 And I really liked it.
00:45:13 Understandable, but not exactly the greatest crowd reader, but that's okay.
00:45:17 Not really.
00:45:20 Well, I, I, yeah, imagine, imagine my surprise to find out that this professional speedrunner
00:45:25 wasn't a people person, was actually kind of a big fucking nerd.
00:45:29 Well, well, not every speedrunner has to be a weirdo.
00:45:33 I, you know, whatever.
00:45:35 I, I, I, I'm playing up my page for speedruns.
00:45:38 I actually really like them as well, but, you know, I just, I like a bit of, I will say
00:45:41 the greatest thing that ever happened to speedrunning is the video Street 112.
00:45:46 Was it GoldenEye?
00:45:47 What?
00:45:48 Oh, well, there's this, there's this GoldenEye video of this guy going beyond God mode as he's
00:45:53 just, like, commentating on his, like, record-breaking GoldenEye run.
00:45:58 Yeah, it's a big meme, but I forget.
00:45:59 Yeah, but what year is it?
00:46:01 I don't know.
00:46:01 No, no, that's what it is.
00:46:03 Street 112.
00:46:03 Oh, that's it.
00:46:04 Yeah.
00:46:04 Okay.
00:46:05 I never even seen 113.
00:46:07 And I never fucking will.
00:46:09 But like, about time we got a fucking lucky break in this fucking game.
00:46:12 Look at my, look at my insane pace.
00:46:15 I am fucking clutch.
00:46:17 It's, he's, he's right in the fucking head.
00:46:20 He does some masterful moves, for sure.
00:46:22 Like, he has practiced this for months or possibly years.
00:46:25 I mean, GoldEye's a fucking old ass game.
00:46:26 Like, these guys become little gods of the worlds that they're in.
00:46:31 Like, it's like they, it's like they've lived their Groundhog Day a thousand million times
00:46:35 and have perfected it on a technical level.
00:46:38 It's just like Groundhog Day.
00:46:40 Except they're actually aging and getting older and wasting their one life on this planet.
00:46:45 That is, you know, I mean, it kind of comes back to the thing we said about video games
00:46:49 the other day about how, like, like, video games, like, if you are like a,
00:46:53 becoming a master speedrunner is like sort of finding a way to become a master of something
00:46:59 that's like not real life.
00:47:01 It like gives you something that you can be in control of and get really great at.
00:47:05 And I mean, you know, obviously like you can like, oh, maybe you can like build a business
00:47:08 and like, oh, I got to like economically strategize.
00:47:11 Like optimize my fucking tax, you know, minimize my tax and optimize my income.
00:47:16 But that's fucking boring.
00:47:17 And I want to be Super Mario jumping on Bowser and kicking my shit in as fast as possible.
00:47:21 You know, once again, like when you're playing it at that high level, like,
00:47:24 I'm sure it stops feeling like, you know, you're Kirby fucking bouncing around in Dream.
00:47:28 Right.
00:47:29 Like you start thinking inputs.
00:47:30 You're thinking inputs.
00:47:31 You're thinking inputs and you're thinking frames.
00:47:33 And you're thinking about, I mean, that's, that's how we felt during the,
00:47:35 that's how we felt during the Dark Souls speedrun.
00:47:37 I'm sure like, I practiced that so many times, I was just, you know,
00:47:41 like, I know, obviously I had no longer any fear of the enemies there.
00:47:44 It's just like, okay, this is a guy.
00:47:45 I know I need to like step back at this moment and do X, Y, Z, all that shit.
00:47:49 And the race that is an editing that's coming up, you know, in the future.
00:47:55 Let's keep that under wraps for now.
00:47:58 Race coming up soon, guys.
00:48:00 Race war.
00:48:01 Race war.
00:48:02 Yes.
00:48:03 Okay.
00:48:03 Do we have anything more to say about sports?
00:48:04 Should we go to questions?
00:48:05 We haven't even talked about sports.
00:48:07 We've been talking about speedruns for the last 90 years.
00:48:10 We've done with the sports.
00:48:12 Sports is fucking awesome.
00:48:13 I'm going to talk about you.
00:48:13 I like to dunk the ball.
00:48:15 Okay, go on.
00:48:15 Okay, okay, okay.
00:48:17 Learning?
00:48:17 Okay, okay.
00:48:18 Here's my like my experience because it was not because like a few years ago,
00:48:21 I was pretty like anti-sports.
00:48:22 There was one of those fucking guys like, oh, it's so fucking boring.
00:48:25 Why would you watch sports?
00:48:26 What are you fucking?
00:48:27 Dude, go read a fucking book.
00:48:29 Am I right, bros?
00:48:30 You didn't even expand your mind.
00:48:31 Hey, where do you work out?
00:48:32 The library?
00:48:34 I was one of those guys.
00:48:35 Damn, damn.
00:48:36 But then I got into esports.
00:48:38 I realized that like the cool thing about sports isn't the sports.
00:48:42 It's the players and how they evolve and like their personal like meta narratives.
00:48:47 Sure, sure.
00:48:48 Cause like, okay, smash.
00:48:49 Smash is like a fun game.
00:48:50 I like to play it.
00:48:51 But the real cool thing about smash is how these fucking gods have like molded these
00:48:57 fucking specific play styles and how they have so much fucking history.
00:49:01 Fucking like 10 years of history playing tournaments together, fighting like fighting
00:49:05 for fucking domination.
00:49:06 Just fucking like what like two years ago, uh, Hungrybox played fucking Jigglypuff.
00:49:12 Like the character that's like not usually considered a top tier until then.
00:49:17 And he fucking won EVO.
00:49:19 He fucking won EVO with like an unconventional character against fucking, I think it was
00:49:23 like maybe something like top tier like Fox guy.
00:49:25 All these so called gods and none of them could beat me with items on.
00:49:32 Oh, true.
00:49:33 So true.
00:49:34 So true.
00:49:35 But yeah, it's just like the entire point of it is just to see these people grow and
00:49:39 expand and evolve and that like that is the cool thing about it.
00:49:43 And then they're like they're fucking like like villains.
00:49:45 They're like people who you want to see get beaten.
00:49:47 There are people who you want to like see like fail or like succeed.
00:49:50 And it's all it's all about them and the way they use the game to like tell like stories.
00:49:55 Kind of sports sports is like this weird chaotic crucible or it's like it's like this.
00:50:02 It's like a strange excuse to like put all these elements together and jiggle them around amidst
00:50:07 unpredictable circumstances amidst like the chaos of like a ball flying around and like
00:50:12 weather and like random chance and like all this stuff.
00:50:15 It's it's just this it's this chaotic crucible from which like narrative can like sometimes
00:50:21 be be be what's the word be like distilled out of like that that and also like numbers
00:50:27 like like sports is like it's just a big thing.
00:50:29 It's just a big like black box into which like players and rules are put in and what comes out
00:50:34 as an endless stream of data that can be endlessly analyzed by fucking nerds by sports nerds like
00:50:40 to find to find trends and like make predictions and like discuss things and you know kind of like
00:50:45 kind of like playing video games and speedrunning video games is a way to like exert mastery over
00:50:50 a thing that isn't real like like analyzing sports statistics and looking into and looking into
00:50:55 like the progression of like of like sports players and like and doing like predictions and stuff
00:50:59 like that's like that also is a way that people can like look at something that's not real like
00:51:03 it's not real life it's just sports but they can like analyze this data and be like I have come to
00:51:08 like a great understanding about something and it's important and it's important within like a
00:51:12 certain subset of people it's sub culturally important like to be able to like to know like
00:51:17 what it means that like so and so like has such and such odds of doing whatever you know what I'm
00:51:22 saying these are like yeah I hear these are like the points of interest I think that that are that
00:51:26 are what drives like the continuing interest in sports and why we haven't all just gotten
00:51:30 why everyone hasn't just gotten bored and being like I know how this ends they get the ball to
00:51:34 the end zone and we haven't had football games that like travel the entire distance of Nebraska
00:51:40 and have states is fucking in stone in soon soon we will though uh one one moment one my favorite
00:51:47 my favorite e-sports moment of all time that like like embodies that like like this like the game
00:51:52 itself doesn't fucking matter is one smash moment at the salty sweet where this where this uh player
00:51:58 this player now known as Bizarro Flame was supposed to fight another like he plays Ganondorf
00:52:03 in melee the greatest character of all time and he was supposed to do a ditto of another
00:52:06 Ganondorf guy but he like he like flicked and he didn't show up he was like sandsie yeah exactly
00:52:12 and so they had they got another I've got another guy to like fill in as like the Ganondorf guy and
00:52:16 he was he was like another he was like another you know well-known Ganondorf but but like the the
00:52:21 game itself isn't really the important part it's it's that it's like it's that guy exerting his
00:52:27 fucking dominance over the character it like in real life so it's like that that match starts off
00:52:32 like hey how do you like the company's like hey how do you feel like like like the guy didn't show up
00:52:37 and then he said oh he's a fraud he's a fucking fraud and then and then like like what do you think
00:52:42 about this match what do you think is going to happen and he just said easy money and then he did
00:52:48 like a he did like a real life super special like move to the guy in real life oh my god and then
00:52:55 the match starts out the match starts out like one two three go and then he just does like one of
00:53:00 Ganondorf's like hardest moves to pull off like five times in a row and fucking eviscerates this guy
00:53:06 in front of like thousands of people meanwhile just talking shit about how he's the greatest
00:53:10 fucking Ganondorf of all time and fucking like like blowing him the fuck out it's fucking great
00:53:17 and like the game itself yeah like like a guy who's better than another person like beat him
00:53:22 at a video game big deal but like like the things are like the politics outside of the game is what
00:53:28 makes it legendary yeah yeah I saw zero walking into like a tournament recently and like the guy
00:53:34 behind him was like you know he had a buck and he was throwing banana peels just as he walked up to
00:53:38 the stage because he plays diddy kong of course yeah it was uh it was pretty yeah I like all that
00:53:43 shit I like when they really like buy into their character diddy kong racing yeah it's just me
00:53:51 I'm winning
00:53:57 I was I was interested like in in in like you know what I was gonna I was gonna talk about the
00:54:03 race that's coming up but actually I don't want to spoil it so I'm not gonna get into it but yeah
00:54:07 plenty of time for that in the future but I would say that like a lot of what you just talked about
00:54:10 applies and of course you would agree to like you know normal sports as well and which is
00:54:15 clearly why a lot of people get into it yeah like in principle it's the same yeah that's right
00:54:20 like like guys like bill burr who I've just been listening to him a lot like he's a giant sports
00:54:24 fan he's always talking about like players and like their their role and like oh fucking so and so
00:54:29 got his first touchdown ever yes he's just so excited for this that's uh you know people get into
00:54:33 that I I don't follow closely enough for that I basically only follow the level of like is my team
00:54:37 doing okay yeah brady did it oh my god I mean there's so many there's so many characters there's so
00:54:44 many like secondary and tertiary and bit player characters in sports it's they're all characters
00:54:49 none of them are real they're all characters I guess you got to get into it like you probably pick
00:54:55 out like you know the top players and like the MVPs and like those are the main characters and then
00:54:59 as you get more into it like you start to like pick up on the nuances of what's going on with more
00:55:03 people this is like one of the not a great example because it's just like one of the most famous
00:55:06 guys in the game but like Tom Brady you know like fucking quarterback of the Patriots is like
00:55:10 he has now won like the last Super Bowl they was on the table for him to win more Super Bowl
00:55:15 champions than any quarterback in history and he did it and obviously that was very exciting for me
00:55:20 and I was just like I was totally pumped about that that was really dope so uh no it's that kind of
00:55:25 shit it's that kind of shit yeah you want to see you want to see your guys win yeah uh the best
00:55:30 thing coming out of sports is the little b-song fuck Kevin Durant which have any of you heard of this
00:55:37 maybe I don't know Kevin Durant is basically I have a very limited knowledge but from what I can
00:55:42 understand this song it's a diss track and Kevin Durant is just this basketball player and then
00:55:47 this fucking guy little b who's like fucking like three feet tall just just made a just just made a
00:55:52 song about how he's gonna fucking he's gonna fuck all the NBA girls in the mouth and like and like
00:55:57 destroy Kevin Kevin Durant in a fucking in a basketball match even though he's like two feet
00:56:02 tall and it's awesome I hope he does so I hope he has already done so
00:56:10 probably all right are we going to you guys have like a javelin teacher in school the
00:56:15 javelin teacher no all right I guess you don't know what a javelin is munchie it's like a spear
00:56:21 it's like a spear oh oh oh you throw it no not like fucking joust you don't throw it it's it's
00:56:28 part of the olympics you know you have like you have the discus you have the shot put you have
00:56:32 the javelin yeah okay those three things we got learned them at school I don't know how common
00:56:38 I was but um I wasn't never very good at the shot put because I had weak arms the discus it was
00:56:45 like frisbee and I was terrible with frisbees so I couldn't do that but the javelin I got I got
00:56:49 really far with one I thought now I have the power to kill people and this is great I never
00:56:55 followed up on it but I really enjoyed throwing javelins and from then on if I had a really long
00:56:59 pointed stick I would throw it and see if it's it landed in the ground and got stuck in the ground
00:57:04 because sometimes it did and that was awesome sick speaking of discus I was I was actually
00:57:11 researching discus the other day like like high level discus and I never really thought about this
00:57:16 but they are like buff they're like buff guys they're they're like bare mode discus yeah I mean
00:57:20 everyone's better at sports when you're just stronger in general yeah true and it was interesting
00:57:25 to see them just fucking like go ham fucking throwing because like the discus have to they
00:57:31 have to be like really heavy in order to fly straight so basically they're throwing like like
00:57:36 like rock or or metal frisbees basically interesting very cool all right guys are we
00:57:43 done with sports now I don't know I don't know we haven't even talked about bicycles or swimming
00:57:57 yeah we're at like the hour mark I like it would be appropriate to switch over to questions
00:58:04 if we hadn't just completely fucked up everything up to this point
00:58:08 well perhaps yeah true true no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'm having a great time I'm having
00:58:14 a great time here with all you guys my best friends yeah I fucking love ping pong even though I'm bad
00:58:19 at it that's a fun game I was pretty great tennis tennis is cool it's like I like it because it has
00:58:25 to do with your hands it's mainly just using your hands and I like using my hands don't mainly just
00:58:31 using you gotta run around you gotta run around you know you gotta you gotta make sure you hit the
00:58:34 ball with your thing that's that's the hard part the running around isn't the part in infinite
00:58:40 just infinite just taught me the tennis is basically like chess and war combined
00:58:47 tennis is like tennis is the ultimate test of a person's mental and physical okay the only thing
00:58:52 I would say about that is that like literally from all the sports manga I have read which is a million
00:58:58 you can make that case about every single sport ever invented and talk about the beauty of the game
00:59:03 and yeah my god these rules are the best rule like I'm reading um I'm reading robo laser beam
00:59:08 right now which is a uh a shonen shonen jump manga by the guy who did kuroke no basque uh kuroko
00:59:14 no basque um which is about golf this is a golf high octane sports manga and like it too like
00:59:20 because they all do goes on my god the game is fucking beautiful it's nothing is as powerful as
00:59:26 golf uh yeah it's like I I'm just assuming that everyone who thinks their sport is the best in
00:59:31 the world I'm with you well I know that that you know ishield 21 told me that american football
00:59:37 well they were actually correct because that is the greatest sport in the world and ishield 21
00:59:41 is the greatest manga in the world so they were correct it's a great manga I was actually thinking
00:59:46 about this the other day I was wondering whether there is like a chess uh anime or manga and people
00:59:53 said oh no well they they have shogi they have the japanese thing and I was like I fucking hate that
00:59:58 fucking weeb shit where is chess where's the ishield do they even know I don't think they
01:00:04 even play shogi in Japan I think it's just a joke that they if they're all in on them they're not
01:00:08 and they're not explaining it to the rest of us probably probably I want to see like I want to
01:00:14 see fucking little witch academia wizard chess tournament arc yeah I agree I agree bring out
01:00:19 Ronald Peasley and get him to fuck up some guys yo I've actually played bear

01:01:44 all right it's time for questions all right we're going to the questions all right here we go
01:01:48 everybody sorry about the dickhead of the pcp didn't want us to talk about sports more sorry
01:01:52 sorry viewers yeah i'm so sorry it's it's all sorry about that dickhead of the pcp shogi bear
01:02:00 yeah that's true uh what the fuck did this go uh okay here's a filler question at joji
01:02:05 only likes picnics baskets with sushi in it
01:02:11 okay actually you know what uh here's a slightly better question uh at its judgment day
01:02:16 asks uh what is the oldest work of art that you are passionate about slash would recommend
01:02:22 the oldest work of art that's like good the stone in karta
01:02:25 yeah stone in stone i consider that a nice sculptory sculpt
01:02:32 that's pretty good uh i like wait wait wait the the the the the the the white horse on the hill
01:02:38 things what are they called uh the spanks they're like old uh gaelic uh Celtic
01:02:44 fucking english things they're like hills where they carved in white rock the shape of a horse and
01:02:51 it's like huge whoa uh that sounds like that thing google it guys uh i'm gonna go with uh the
01:03:01 works of Mozart in general i think i'm quite fond of them uh i like listening to him and i i don't
01:03:07 know maybe uh oh maybe the sistine chapel it's pretty cool i never like seen it though i just
01:03:11 think it's pretty cool cave paintings they're so old yeah yeah you can't get much older i'm trying
01:03:16 to be the oldest guy so whatever anyone says i'm gonna say i like something older because
01:03:21 that's like the hipsteriest uh i would say i really like the pyramids of geese because
01:03:28 specifically because they have that love of battleship fifty feet below it so fifty feet
01:03:32 below the pyramids of geese there is there is a love battleship that can only be powered in
01:03:36 times of need so so so for for instance if you need a battle in alien in alien race
01:03:42 trying to overthrow the united states government in the in the 1950s then you a south american
01:03:47 woman from peru can can mosey on over to the pyramid visa and then locate the love battleship
01:03:53 that that is 50 yards 50 miles across and three atoms thick you can you can look at that that
01:04:00 battleship and and you can power it and and and and when once inside using the power of love and
01:04:07 you're aligned chakras you can drive you can drive the aliens from your land due due to
01:04:12 instantly making them all have the black plague that that's my favorite part about it and that's
01:04:18 my favorite sculpture in the entire world that's good i'm gonna say that my favorite uh my oldest
01:04:24 favorite work of art is the actor william hickey this is uh he played he's like this really scary
01:04:32 old guy he's the scariest oldest guy in every movie ever he died in 1994 and he's still the oldest
01:04:40 that's how old and scary he is um he played he was like this old man with like a haunted cat in the
01:04:47 tales from the dark side movie the cat killed him and crawled out of his throat it was really gross
01:04:52 and cool cool he's like he's so he's he's got this like scary tongue he's like he's always got a
01:04:58 scary tongue that's his main feature as an actor he played uh pete and pete's grandfather
01:05:03 on the adventures of pete and pete everybody go look up go go go look up like arty versus the
01:05:09 bowling ball on pete and pete he's the guy like the bowling ball kicks arty's ass and like his
01:05:15 extended fight sequence of arty versus this evil bowling ball and it kicks arty's ass and at the
01:05:20 end of it arty is like laying on the ground the bowling ball is like pinning him it's defeated him
01:05:26 and and like the grandfather comes out and he's like foolish man brave but foolish
01:05:36 is this is this like mystery men uh bowling ball rules where it's you know got its own will
01:05:40 and it's flying around doing shit yeah it's like like they didn't have the special effects to make
01:05:45 it actually fly around and do shit so it's all the actor who plays arty just like pantomining fighting
01:05:50 the bowling ball and it's the best thing ever but yeah the guy who plays pete and pete's grandpa
01:05:55 is my favorite work of art so canonically this character could have a mental illness and actually
01:06:01 just think that he's fighting a bowling ball no arty is a real superhero that is a real evil
01:06:05 bowling ball okay its power was too great for this world uh okay here we go here's the next question
01:06:12 um this is a baffling question that i want to shame this person for asking uh it's uh at dragon ring
01:06:19 34 asks do you think english song are inherently worse than the original song oh that's worse that's
01:06:26 the question is this person playing that every song was not in english i think that's what they're
01:06:31 proposing uh is this like an anime question or something i want to shame you for asking anime
01:06:36 related questions person we don't have to shame let's shame them for asking what we can only infer
01:06:41 is an anime related question but there's no other explanation i have an answer i have an answer
01:06:46 at this man his his his uh accusation is wrong that the english song is worse than the non english
01:06:54 song because on the first gorillas album there's a song called latin simone and it's a song that
01:07:00 for some reason is in spanish and it's just this like spanish guy singing the song and you're like
01:07:06 what is this you skip it every time you listen to the album you skip that stupid fucking song
01:07:10 but then on the b sides album the e p that they released entitled g size right after their first
01:07:16 album there was an english version of that song that 2d sang and it was way better and listen to
01:07:20 it and you're like oh wow this is actually a really cool song i didn't know before because it was in
01:07:24 spanish and ain't nobody speaks that shit so that's why that guy was wrong about that thing he said
01:07:28 just now pretty well he he said do you think english song are inherently worse than the original
01:07:35 song a nice my answer was gorillas right yeah shut up dude that's a bad question okay um here's
01:07:45 okay here's an interesting question i actually like this one a lot okay at hero cactus asks well it's
01:07:50 not a question but videos you would show at a job interview so which of your videos would you use at
01:07:57 a job job uh i don't know mine would yeah depends on the job of course uh it would be the entirety
01:08:05 of the japanese juggalo arc yeah that's good that's good i i would show the ending of my rayman 3s uh
01:08:11 three part uh where i got all the all the people playing the the band but it's oh yeah one shot
01:08:19 and that yeah it's if it's like an editing job i'm saying look look at what i can do with all this
01:08:24 stupid shit i don't i don't know what i'd personally pick but for you gib i think you should definitely
01:08:29 go for uh like why clopping is okay you know sexuality of my little pony i definitely go for
01:08:35 that you know that yeah they've definitely got to know my my stance on that of course it's important
01:08:39 agree god i love clopping jesus christ rose agree i clopped to not even ponies i clopped but not as
01:08:50 in mastery i just i just go to do that's what clop it sounds like probably okay here's a strange
01:08:57 question um at auto jk asks what is biggest letdown in your gaming history what like um i think
01:09:06 you say why do we have fucking well that that's because i'll tell you i have a great action for
01:09:10 that question my my my greatest disappointment in my gaming career was on that digi bros episode
01:09:17 ben owns it at downwell um was the fact spoilers yeah was the fact that i got so close and i didn't
01:09:23 win um it was like it was like right down to the wire but i like just fucking barely didn't do it
01:09:30 and if i had done it it would have been the most legendary performance of all time but alas i came
01:09:35 so close so that was a big that was a big letdown to me and got so far but in the end it doesn't
01:09:41 even matter i was gonna say that because i got killed to me it's too soon dude it's too fucking
01:09:46 soon chester jeez poor guy i was like debating maybe it's too soon but i bet that demon munchie
01:09:54 will say look look i'm sorry the guy's dead but to stop saying the memes that we've been saying
01:09:59 for literally decades now somebody watch told me the next one died don't say it oh no uh yeah i want
01:10:09 is about my biggest gaming disappointment i of course had to bring up my loss in the pokemon
01:10:13 race which was absolutely devastating uh on a deep level everyone go watch that and the other one
01:10:18 the other one that that comes to mind is uh yeah long ago when ben and i were first playing uh mario
01:10:24 rpg legend of the seven stars oh god i know we've talked about this before i i think but like so
01:10:29 we had gone through the whole game i was watching ben play as i as i used to because we were very
01:10:33 little back then this i was like seven or eight or something and ben was playing and we were both we
01:10:37 just both i'd watched him play like the whole game and he was fighting smithy the final boss
01:10:41 and on our we was down to the wire only malo i believe was still alive and on like we there's
01:10:46 this move psychopath that just tells you how much hp the enemy has i don't remember exactly who was
01:10:51 alive but i remember that the last thing that happened was we right we used psychopath to see
01:10:56 how much hp smithy had and he had around like 34 or something and the average attack did like a hunt
01:11:02 like would have killed if we had just attacked we would have won and then he killed us all on his
01:11:07 next turn and we wept we wept like we babes in the crib it was brutal it was absolutely brutal
01:11:14 but even though like we could have just tried again like we were just such babies at video games
01:11:19 then we like didn't it was just so sad to like lose to a final boss because we'd been we'd been
01:11:23 trying like for a long time like we'd been trying like all day i think and we were like so we were
01:11:28 so close yeah yeah and it was and to our little pea brain minds it was just devastating and we
01:11:33 tried and did we did we get our hoots back up and like fight again immediately like later that day
01:11:37 no i think we tried i think we tried again another day yeah i think you're right guys i think i think
01:11:43 that was the end for for that time for that session i agree it was brutal yeah there have been
01:11:50 multiple times where i've like tried like tried really hard and failed so many times i've just
01:11:58 given up and said fuck this game i'll never play it again and then you know a week later i'll pick
01:12:02 it up yeah so but there's not like one specific one that's so notable that i can remember it
01:12:08 i'm just i just know that sometimes i get mad at video games yeah yeah that's all i know as well
01:12:15 that's the only thing i know about video games is that they make me mad sometimes but you know
01:12:19 what easy come easy go you never shine if you don't grow whatever uh all right well okay here's
01:12:27 just a question to for us to go out on at jam skmain something like that asks uh this isn't easy
01:12:33 this is a little fucking lab which pcp member do you think will die first it's bumpy it's obviously
01:12:39 bumpy oh yeah yeah it's definitely he's gonna kill himself there you go um any debate any debate
01:12:45 about this actually um yeah um i think he's uh i think he's coward and i challenge him to do it
01:12:52 and prove us all wrong oh i i i think i at what i don't remember which episode but i i i i i've
01:12:56 got i'm just kidding please god i'm just kidding i i did i think i also said that in a different
01:13:02 episode pen yeah in this in the suicide podcast i think we made bets on this and i believe i
01:13:08 bet that he would never commit suicide it was actually my bet you know you know here's the
01:13:12 thing i would i would say i would say he's not gonna do it i would say that about most people
01:13:17 but you know what then you say that and then they do it and then you look like you then you get
01:13:21 all over your face yeah he wants that you know i've been going around all this time saying
01:13:28 the lead singer of linkin park is never gonna kill himself no matter what else happens in life
01:13:34 and now i look like the damnedest buffoon there is you did in the end it didn't even matter yeah
