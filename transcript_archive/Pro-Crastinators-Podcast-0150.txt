00:00:34 We could churn out fucking shirts, okay?
00:00:37 I'm hypocrite that was Ben St. and Nate Bestman the best bangers
00:00:41 I'm voting for a t-shirt that says holy shit a t-shirt you should make it make it and put it on the PCV thing
00:00:49 easy to make um
00:00:50 Um, they're so easy well kind of if you know how teespring works, which I had to learn through a long and arduous arduous process
00:00:57 It was a give as well also dealt with some shit there. I mean he's my he's my I'm tutoring him
00:01:02 I'm tutoring hippo in the teespring arts. It's the uh, I'm an apprentice to that to that skill
00:01:08 Because teespring is is like a bucking bronco. It's really yeah, I went to college. I I majored in teespring
00:01:14 You know engineering and teespring uh usage. I'm pretty good. It's pretty lucrative career
00:01:20 Yes, it is hippo by the shirts you had to buy the by the shirts
00:01:25 Uh, they should be uh, I went and connected the youtube so you might by this point when you're listening to this
00:01:30 You might be able to see shirts down under the video. Oh hell. No hell. Yeah
00:01:35 Uh, you had a great idea hippo with a we talked about this before the show
00:01:39 And I'm gonna bring it back up the the where hashtag wears the podcast shirt
00:01:43 And I said that I said, yeah
00:01:45 I said I would love that but what I would really love to really solidify that meme is if
00:01:51 Whoever runs that podcast that pizza party podcast
00:01:55 I've heard so much about but haven't been able to locate
00:01:58 If one of them would acknowledge it if they would like be like why is everyone always saying hashtag?
00:02:03 Where's the podcast in the comments? What's going on? That would solidify it. That's that's my goal
00:02:09 They should they should make sure and they should all wear them
00:02:11 I just want them to acknowledge that no one can find this podcast. Yeah, the problem with that is that um
00:02:19 In order to leave a comment on the podcast
00:02:21 They need to find the podcast and we just can't find the podcast to leave the comments
00:02:25 I I can't find the podcast
00:02:28 But if anyone finds it, please leave a comment that says where's the podcast
00:02:32 Please leave a comment asking where the podcast is on my behalf and then and then
00:02:37 Let me know what they say because I'm I'm really looking
00:02:41 We need them to establish some sort of shirt on their end that says here's the podcast
00:02:46 And then we can wage epic large-scale warfare between the legions of where's the podcast
00:02:53 Everyone's got to choose a side in the battle of good versus evil. Are you team?
00:02:57 Where's the podcast or team? Here's the podcast

00:03:08 Uh
00:03:11 I speaking of
00:03:14 Speaking of winning welcome to episode 150 of the procrastinators podcast people because there's a hundred and fifty
00:03:23 Oh
00:03:29 To pcp members are destiny. Oh, that's good. Yeah, but you'll never be just give up that home
00:03:34 Pidgeot, just as ash ketchup niterino gold duck. Oh my night. Slow. Slow. Mewtwo tentacle aero dactyl
00:03:42 Oh my night. Slow. Hey guys
00:03:44 Mewtwo tentacle aero dactyl. Oh my night. Slow. Shut up. Shut up enough
00:03:50 Fuckin go back and in in in every podcast you will you'll find if you look hard enough a secret, uh, meme
00:03:59 A secret code that links to the specific pokemon that the episode is the number of
00:04:05 I've I've been leaving them all in every episode from the very beginning. I thought this far ahead
00:04:10 I knew there would be 150 episodes. I knew it wouldn't have been a waste of time
00:04:15 We'll get I'll give you a hint. I'll give you a hint of one episode episode one best game ever
00:04:20 What's the most gamer pokemon? You know, you know the answer to that
00:04:24 It's definitely I was thinking rotom rotom looks like a hardcore game, but he's not number one. Fuck rotom
00:04:31 It might be it might be bulbous or though. Um, it's up to you to figure out one of those two. It's definitely one of those two
00:04:37 Um, depends what decks depends what regional decks you're using some regions. It's rotom. Yeah, that's fair
00:04:44 In in gamer in uh in gang weed, uh region, you know the gamer verse, uh, I think rotom is pokemon 001
00:04:52 Isn't game reverse a real thing
00:04:55 Um, I hope so make something called the game reverse
00:04:59 Oh god, he would from game grumps ross. He would make something wait. It might be the game. That sounds like a nostalgia critic
00:05:05 It might it might be the game over the game, but whatever it is. I think it's a bell, but I don't know what it is
00:05:10 Uh, it doesn't sound impressive. Let's talk about how much I hate ross
00:05:13 No, okay before we talk about how much we hate ross, let's talk about the thing that we totally
00:05:19 Intentionally, you guys did not talk about on the last pcb episode because this is the pokemon episode 150
00:05:26 Let's talk about pokemon sword and shield and how it was just announced
00:05:29 And how it looks like a real video game. It was completely unmentioned last episode
00:05:33 Well, you did do a whole other like a stream, but it was on nate's channel. I think well, yeah, that's true
00:05:39 That's strong
00:05:40 And while you all should go to definitely twitch.tv slash definitely best guy ever and subscribe, um, nonetheless
00:05:48 Some people did not and so they need to up
00:05:51 We I mean, yeah, it's fair to say just go watch the video. It's on my live stream channel and stuff, but yeah
00:05:57 I mean, I
00:05:58 Think I said everything I had to say about it on this on that stream
00:06:01 Well, I wasn't on the stream and I tweeted about it like all day after the announcement
00:06:05 Like all that day I was making tweets about sword and shield
00:06:09 I made a few tweets as well
00:06:11 Yeah, it was all it was all shit pokemon comes out social media is blast and you can see sobel
00:06:16 You can see groovy. You can see bunny
00:06:19 And you can see them everywhere
00:06:21 Uh, cool. Let's let's get into it. Let's get into it new starters all stupid all the all the same round head
00:06:28 All the same shape. Yeah
00:06:30 Underwhelming underwhelming. I don't know. I don't care overly homogenous designs. I don't care about the round heads
00:06:36 I don't care that much, but I do think it's a pretty weak badge
00:06:42 Look, everyone knows they're fine. Levolution is the one that really matters. Yes. That's true. That's true
00:06:46 No, and in the case of torchic that is not true
00:06:49 Uh, well, yes, some people really like blaziken. I'm not one of those people. Yeah the digimon fans of the pokemon
00:06:57 I don't hate him. You like blaziken. I don't hate blaziken. He's fine
00:07:01 I mean, he was the first of his kind right the first of the digimon in pokemon
00:07:05 Was he before was he before druddigon?
00:07:08 Yes, probably I forget who that is, but yes
00:07:12 Uh, he looks like a digimon. He's that blue. He's a blue dragon with a red head
00:07:17 Oh, yeah, it was before that. I uh, I remember you guys talking about like, oh, is it england or is it not?
00:07:23 And I guess at this point it's been confirmed. You were you were like it's england. Um and stuff
00:07:29 No, it's great britain not just england. Well, yeah
00:07:33 Oh, fair. Oh, very good. I didn't see an island anywhere. The lecture gave about that some more. Why don't you mage?
00:07:39 You fucking foreigner. Cool
00:07:42 That's called that's literally cultural appropriation
00:07:45 Knowing things about the United Kingdom. You came over here, you're an imogrant
00:07:48 You get out so you get to the brush the broom and sweep you out the door. Wait. No, you get out
00:07:54 Uh
00:07:56 Hippo hippo care is from africa hippo is from africa. So he's an imogrant
00:08:07 Oh new character in the hippo court universe the imogrant. Uh, yeah, he should I don't know
00:08:12 Well, it's it's a side story
00:08:15 It's like it's like after after hippo wasn't allowed to make videos anymore. He like he had to like walk the earth
00:08:22 He's a stranger in every land. It's like it's alt universe. That that is canon hippo hippo is walking the earth right now
00:08:29 Yeah, in search of the purpose
00:08:32 Yeah, frankly. I'm not optimistic about his chances. He's a very small boy. So, you know, it's a very very small animal
00:08:41 Speaking of small boys small animals pokemon, right?
00:08:44 Uh bunny. Yeah, I like him. Uh the little lizard guy. He's he's funny. I saw I like that
00:08:50 He's crying all the time. That's funny. Yeah, he's just so like
00:08:54 That's his cry. That's his cry because he's crying
00:08:58 Uh groovy is just a guy with a thing. He has a he's a farfetched
00:09:03 You know, I've heard a lot of people saying that groovy is gonna evolve into like a
00:09:08 Metal drummer or like some kind of like like drummer. Oh, which sounds pretty cool
00:09:13 And I would be into that if true. Oh, yeah, that that was the thing I was thinking like pokemon based off of things in
00:09:20 The great britland the u.k.
00:09:22 Mum Keith mum Keith threatened me. He told me I better not pick the monkey and I told him he can have that gremlin
00:09:28 But if he turns into a cool rock drummer, I might regret my words. I might eat. I might eat my words
00:09:33 Yeah, if he turns into a drummer, I'm definitely gonna name him bonzo because that's the perfect name
00:09:37 Why is that the perfect name to everyone who knows the reference?
00:09:41 I don't know the I'm not I'm not in on the reference
00:09:44 Because you don't know you don't know enough about english rock legends. That's why I know neil pert
00:09:48 He's english. I think
00:09:50 Wait, is russian american
00:09:52 No, russia's american
00:09:54 russian russian limbaugh
00:09:56 Yeah, he's american the famous drum, uh, but like, uh
00:10:00 Bunny right that I saw there was a soccer field a football field
00:10:06 So i'm thinking maybe that's a football playing bunnies running real fast. He's got like the color of things
00:10:12 You know the whiteness
00:10:14 White people play football only white people are allowed. There's a lot of racism in the football community
00:10:19 So like that fits that works. Hell. Yeah
00:10:22 Yeah, and the little
00:10:24 Crying guy, that's me. So like it all is like very accurate to england
00:10:30 And I and I really want to see if there's like a t-based pokemon or like a
00:10:35 Oh, yeah, you know like a black pudding pokemon. I want a garden. No, I want a garden. No pokemon
00:10:41 Yeah, I think you're already doing pretty well with like the knights and shields and swords
00:10:46 Garden pokemon sounds pretty funny actually
00:10:49 It's like ground fairy type
00:10:52 And like it doesn't actually look like a gnome, but it's got like the hat
00:10:55 Shape that's like definitely what I would love. What I would love is like um a pokemon
00:11:00 That's like a suit of armor and if it comes into contact with an age slash or whatever the sword guy is
00:11:07 Um, then he then they evolve into like, you know how like um
00:11:11 Sheldre clamps onto a slow poke and they turn into the other guy
00:11:15 It'll be like that sort of thing
00:11:17 Wait, he just gets a weapon and he wields it. He wields his friend and then he's super powered
00:11:23 That would be really cool. Who's kind of the best pokemon, uh, who reminds me of that? You know, you know gollerc
00:11:28 Gollerc rock flying or no, he's rock ghost. I think he's he's ground ghost
00:11:32 Ground ghost and he can just fly because he's a hero. He can kind of the best goller can fly
00:11:38 Uh, is he the evolved form or is he the first form? He's the evolved
00:11:42 Okay, the the whole point of that ghost rock golem looking pokemon is that when he evolves where he learns fly
00:11:48 Because his whole thing is that he's a giant golem who can just fly
00:11:52 That's weird. How sick is that that's the coolest thing sick of all time
00:11:56 Yeah, it's kind of funny like the idea of like a rock that has departed
00:12:01 From the mortal realm and it's ground. He's made of clay
00:12:05 So like he can he can like, you know
00:12:07 If you smash a rock it becomes a rock ghost and then it hits you because it can still it's still a rock
00:12:13 I gotta I gotta put this in the show notes. Um, you gotta behold the image of gollerc in the okay
00:12:19 It's going in the links thing. There it is. Uh, like this is him
00:12:23 He's just like a mech who just flies and it's sick as shit. Uh, is this in gross disgusting audio? Whoa
00:12:30 Oh, he that's that's
00:12:32 Oh, that's cool. I don't know. I've seen that guy before I think that was like an edit
00:12:36 I think the bottom one's like the the the real one if that's it. Okay
00:12:40 Is that a shiny color because if so, it's really cool, but I doubt it. I think so because shiny
00:12:44 I'm gonna look up shiny. I don't know. I haven't I haven't checked the top one looks like a bend 10 guy
00:12:50 He does. Yeah, he does. He does. You know, I kind of want to go back. It's kind of rfck
00:12:55 I love tyranitar, but I kind of want to put gollerc is my favorite rock type pokemon
00:13:00 I'm telling you he's ground
00:13:02 Damn it. How many times do I have to say it?
00:13:05 Yeah, okay. Good point. Doesn't he just look like a rock guy though? I guess he's mud though, which is
00:13:10 Yeah, all right. I think he's supposed to be made of clay. I mean, he's a golem and golems are made out of clay
00:13:15 I that's true. That's true. Oh, no, that is. Uh, yeah, that's that's his shiny color
00:13:20 He's got like a green kind of crack in him and he's kind of grayish and bluish dark. Yeah, awesome
00:13:26 There you go. I like the the the aesthetic of him being like, uh
00:13:30 Cracked open but then with a little metal plaster
00:13:34 Yeah, just go yeah, you're super cool
00:13:37 Every single that's just part of the process of making a golerc is like you you fuse him in the in the kiln
00:13:43 And they all crack across the middle and then you put the band-aid on him and then bam you got yourself a golerc
00:13:50 By the way, I might be wrong about him learning fly by evolving because I'm not seeing it in his
00:13:54 Thing, but whatever. I'm just assuming that's true. He learns flea because he's a fucking coward
00:14:00 Anyway, he's a badass. Uh, he's killer it but it can it can learn fly
00:14:06 Yeah, it can learn fly. So that's confirmed. That's confirmed. Oh, I just remembered. Um, is the bunny called score bunny?
00:14:13 Like scoring a goal like goal
00:14:15 So I think he's gonna he's gonna evolve to have a football or something
00:14:19 He's gonna have some dumb
00:14:20 Don't you hate those kind of powers like yamcha where he like makes an energy ball and then he like volleyball
00:14:25 Is it it's like just shoot him with the laser gun
00:14:28 No, just my my boy my boy's my boy's spork spork town hero drew something on twitter that just
00:14:37 Is the weirdest thing girl I didn't
00:14:40 uh, nothing
00:14:42 I didn't um, I didn't uh
00:14:45 Understand, but it was it was score bunny evolving to
00:14:51 Into like a wheelchair
00:14:53 Yeah, yeah, because um, because um, what they probably like broke his leg or something and and like couldn't pursue its career
00:15:01 Like in these like evolves into like a amputee
00:15:06 I thought the joke was that like the first guy has a piece of tape on his nose
00:15:10 And then as he evolves he like has more more wounds and more injuries until he's like in a wheelchair at the end
00:15:17 And he's mad about it
00:15:18 You know what he should be in true soccer player fashion
00:15:21 He should be he should evolve into finally like flop bunny
00:15:23 Or like his main move is that he pretends to be injured to elicit
00:15:27 And and yellow cards on the other opponents that he's fighting
00:15:31 Uh, or he injures himself perhaps to do this
00:15:34 You know, I've just realized what if they have like pokemon football like a sports team where you choose who plays in what?
00:15:40 like uh thing
00:15:42 And the stats
00:15:44 Determine how cool. Yeah
00:15:46 Like uh, oh, yeah, I'll put like goal lurk in in goal and he's so big
00:15:51 I'll put like whale lord in goal. Nobody would get pasta. Yeah
00:15:55 That that would be like a really good mini game that they could imagine like mega man soccer, but with pokemon
00:16:02 Imagine like ape escape to soccer, but with pokemon
00:16:04 Yeah
00:16:07 Ape escape to soccer is the best thing
00:16:09 Wait, is that a real thing?
00:16:11 Yeah, and there's a mini game. It's not ape escape soccer. It's ape escape to soccer
00:16:15 Yeah, because in ape escape to
00:16:17 Oh, it's a mini game
00:16:19 Yeah, one of the mini games you can unlock out of three
00:16:22 So the you know, there's only there's not so that many of them
00:16:25 But there's like every ape you can collect in the game
00:16:28 You can they have certain stats the the more powerful monkeys
00:16:32 Have like higher stats and higher later in the game
00:16:34 You can find like really powerful monkeys and special monkeys like the santa claws monkey monkey claws
00:16:40 Uh, they have like really good stats and you you just play football against ai and or a friend
00:16:46 and it's just like the the silliest and best football game ever made because
00:16:52 You the the main thing is that you run around with the left stick and with the right stick you choose which direction to kick
00:16:58 Oh, that's good
00:17:00 So instead of it being like a whole like oh press the x button to shoot if you're in the right position
00:17:04 You you pass with the with the the you know the shape buttons triangle circle
00:17:10 To to the to you know
00:17:12 A bunch of monkeys who have that over their heads, you know instantly who that is that's that's normal
00:17:17 But then to shoot you just push the direction and if you kick it really hard with a monkey that has really high attack stat
00:17:24 You can just kick the ball
00:17:25 Smash it into the monkey's face that's in front of you and knock him out
00:17:29 And you can just keep doing that and and if the ball goes out of bounds
00:17:33 You know there's a chance that the ball thrown back in could be like a spike ball
00:17:38 Instead of the regular ball and if you kick that that like knocks them out and then that you know half time comes around
00:17:43 They have no energy left. They can't play anymore. You have to swap them out for someone else. It's epic
00:17:48 That reminds me of kind of blitz ball from final messy 10 only
00:17:52 Better everybody loves everybody loves blitz ball
00:17:56 What's the fuck I'm here too. It's me. Hey, what's up?
00:18:01 Is it is it daylight savings time? Is that why I'm late? Is it not my fault? Good. I'm glad I did at everybody
00:18:08 But you know, you know fair it is in fact daylight savings time
00:18:13 Hi jess you recording. Hi. Yes. I am. Okay. We are talking about pokemon mostly and and let's get down to brass tax people
00:18:21 Because here's the deal. Oh, by the way, jesse. This is episode 150. So, you know pokemon. We did it
00:18:26 Ommonite slow poke mule tool tentacle aero dactyl

00:18:46 I pushed it so hard gross that everyone loved it
00:18:51 No, just just just that part of the ninja rap but repeated over and over again
00:18:54 You put like the symbols for like each of them you put like an ommonite shell
00:18:58 Like a pigeon feather or something and you just repeat the what what is the say the say the line one time ben?
00:19:03 Well, now I don't want to say it anymore. You made me feel
00:19:06 I forget what it is got ommonite slow poke mule tool ten mule two tentacle aero dactyl
00:19:12 Okay, there you go. So that five that's the meme put those in a row and make it incredible
00:19:17 Make it short that just does a mule tool and it's like a mule tube
00:19:20 But like he's got like wrenches in his hands and shit. No, but he wait wait hold. He's mute. That's my cool
00:19:25 But he's like a god kid and he's wearing like a tool shirt because he really likes the band
00:19:30 Yeah, yeah, like uh, he's like tim ellen

00:20:08 And all their games look like shit. What's there?
00:20:11 That doesn't look like shit. It's just like they don't need to make it any more than that
00:20:16 Because the kids just they just care about they don't care about I was I was indulging a parent

00:20:43 Billions of fucking dollars like no, it doesn't it doesn't it is a disturbing vice. Yeah
00:20:51 You like you can not even go into like a closet in the dark to watch arlo videos
00:20:57 Oh, oh and let people know about that shit. I put on I pull out my puppet and he's the one who watches arlo videos
00:21:03 Not me. I'm not watching
00:21:05 All right guys, uh on the topic of arlo
00:21:08 I've I've had a problem with arlo in the past because I always thought like, you know, the muppet thing
00:21:13 He doesn't really go very far with it
00:21:15 Indeed indeed. How could he go any further with it?
00:21:18 Well, you know by by no what I mean is like he's not he doesn't use it for comedy necessarily
00:21:23 Or like he's just not very funny with it
00:21:25 But recently I found I found a muppet who is a stand-up comedian and he is he's unbelievably funny
00:21:33 No, uh
00:21:34 Both because both because you know the jokes are pretty good and he seems to have a you know a real grasp of reality
00:21:40 And he's not like a dumb idiot
00:21:42 But also his his his muppet movements are so correct
00:21:47 Like like like
00:21:49 I'm trying to find what it it's called randy his randy the he looks like a grape
00:21:55 Um, I'm looking him up. I'm I'm googling him. I saw he has he has a he has a special
00:22:01 And that I found on youtube called randy writes a novel
00:22:04 And it's a it's a that sounds really good just from the title
00:22:09 Yeah
00:22:10 Oh, he's really creepy looking. Oh, no, but he's great and he swears as well because it is like he's he's like uh
00:22:18 Randy writes a novel he does look like he's spooky
00:22:22 He yeah, but he's like an he's an australian, uh, you know vegan crazy man who is a really good muppet
00:22:30 puppeteer
00:22:31 And he's now sounds like it's really funny
00:22:34 unironically now this is epic
00:22:37 Yeah
00:22:38 Everybody should go look at that
00:22:40 I'm looking i'm gonna watch more of this later
00:22:43 um, okay, hey to make us a fun happy time
00:22:47 uncomfortably
00:22:49 Uncomfortable for everyone. Please I want the reason I brought up shield chan
00:22:54 Is because so new pokemon came out new pokemon girl
00:22:59 Everyone starts making porn of her right? That's just what happens every single time. Oh my god
00:23:04 Amazing. I I I'm sorry. I'm so I'm I'm really hung up that everyone's like oh the new girl's cute
00:23:09 She looks exactly like the old girl
00:23:11 She's got a new hat. What do you want? Yeah, new new fucking hat
00:23:17 Her hair only curls in on one side of her face. You can fucking change your hair curled on both sides
00:23:21 You know, you can go to the fucking barber. She's the same girl. I hate it
00:23:26 Every every human-shaped thing is going to be the same if you can customize the appearance
00:23:29 You can just make that's not like whatever. She's the exact same face the exact same body customizable hair
00:23:35 I feel like a lot of a lot of the time
00:23:37 Is exactly the same thing where all the girls are exactly the same person except the hair is different and everyone thinks
00:23:43 Look, I watch anime. That's always been the case. That's always been the case
00:23:47 That's just not surprising real life. Also. Most people are just interchangeable sacks of shit with different hair
00:23:55 Look, I get your point Ben and I actually agree. It's just that I don't know. I'm I'm over it. I guess I've just accepted that this is
00:24:02 I don't if you can customize the appearance then
00:24:04 I don't know. You just make them look however you want exactly. She's not a new girl. She's nobody
00:24:10 Okay, but she has a default design. Look, she's Scottish. This is her biggest personality trait that she people whatever
00:24:16 They never have personality. We infer we we put a personality onto her. She's a rough and tumble Scottish lass
00:24:22 That's what's been projected by the audience. That's a distinct personality
00:24:26 It's exactly the same whatever the girl from black and white looked like like she had a design
00:24:30 Like yeah, this the new girl doesn't have a design all she has is a sweater and a hat
00:24:35 That's literally all you can do the thing the thing that is just the case
00:24:40 Is that the thing is announced and everybody gets hyped when it's announced and they you know, they see her and they're like
00:24:46 Oh, I can't wait to play pokemon. Oh, and she's a girl. That means I want to have sex with her
00:24:50 So I'm gonna do a porn of her. I'm gonna give her a character and she's like that hat. That's a Scottish hat
00:24:56 She's a Scottish lass and there's that means she's angry and she punches people great
00:25:00 I love this person. The boy is all in their heads and it's it's it's all in our collective heads in the video game
00:25:08 Nothing not even slightly gonna be like that
00:25:11 But we like it we get we get hyped by ourselves
00:25:15 Well, it's the same as toho like toho the characters barely of any personality
00:25:18 They have a little bit and it's the fandom that runs with it at least they say that's just how it is
00:25:24 At least the characters in toho. Yeah, do have dialogue. They do have
00:25:28 Well, like I don't know like the the main character persona. I've been led to believe
00:25:33 It's a it's a player avatar. It has no defined personality. It's how you play it that gives it a personality
00:25:39 So, you know, that's not true in toho. That's not true in toho. That's yeah, you're right. That's not true in toho
00:25:45 I mean, I can't remember when they stopped doing this
00:25:48 But isn't it like the character you choose the opposite gender character that you could have been is your rival and they do have a character because they have lines
00:25:56 I think so. Yeah. Yeah, but like uh in the last one was in sun and moon
00:26:01 Yeah, like that they're changing it now. So that's true. That's true. There is no character whatsoever
00:26:06 Wait, it's it's been through some sapphire and ruby and sapphire and ruby that definitely was how it works
00:26:10 Oh, yeah, that's that's the one I remember because that's my favorite. Sometimes it's like that not always
00:26:15 Yeah, that's true. Well, hey, okay. Here's my point. Here's the thing. I want to talk about it's just that
00:26:22 New pokemon comes out. There's a girl whatever
00:26:25 Well, I think in a game with I think in a game with customizable characters. They won't do that
00:26:29 I think they just never gonna get to say I just want to say they it won't be like it's so provocative
00:26:33 It's so big brain
00:26:35 They won't I'm just saying they won't do that because the characters have no set design
00:26:40 And there's no point making them a rival because they are no one
00:26:44 I guess that makes sense. I get well, I don't know. There was no character
00:26:48 In emerald or sapphire ruby. There there was kind of like there may is a character
00:26:54 Yeah, may and that's only because the show the show gave me her character. She's she's nobody. Well, I've never seen the show
00:27:00 And I know what maze like she has big boobs. That's her character. That's not even accurate. Okay, whatever
00:27:05 Um, uh speaking of big boobs. This is my point. All right. Here it is. This is my point people are complaining
00:27:11 About people making porn about the pokemon girl. This is the point. I want to get you. She literally is her hat
00:27:18 Uh, she's she's she's indiana jones. That's my point though, ben. That's my point. Look, I get it
00:27:24 People come out of the woodwork and they're like, oh my god guys. What are you doing sexualizing like a canonically 12 year old girl?
00:27:31 But this is not a real person and this person is so undefined a personality or an existence
00:27:37 And the porn of her doesn't even necessarily draw her at that age generally doesn't right? I mean, how would you even know?
00:27:42 How would you even I just it brings to my mind? How can anyone
00:27:47 Care about this issue is what comes to my brain?
00:27:50 I don't understand like if people are looking for things to get mad about and find reasons to be it's a it's a it's a combination
00:27:59 Of virtue signaling and also extreme mental retardation
00:28:04 Where they actually believe that lines on a piece of paper is a person. Yes
00:28:12 If you don't believe that then you can't care about this issue
00:28:15 You have to be mentally fucking retard the fact of the matter is like you look at pokemon and like characters that are like 12
00:28:23 18 20 30 they all pretty much look the same
00:28:27 Like you can't really even tell until they start to get into like middle age
00:28:31 It's like they expect are like our our vision when we look at an anime character
00:28:36 We should be able to see past
00:28:38 Like the the physical appearance of the character and be able to deduce like the stat sheet and see uh-oh age
00:28:46 Uh, you know below 18 if that means sexuality switched off
00:28:49 We cannot you know, but that's not it just makes me so mad that I see people and look
00:28:54 I know it's probably like a fringe group, but surprisingly large
00:28:58 Surprising large number of people I'm gonna I'm gonna play the devil's advocate on this one. Okay. Um, I feel like it's not
00:29:05 Play the devil's advocate and advocate against pedophilia
00:29:09 Yeah
00:29:10 indeed
00:29:11 Like I feel like
00:29:13 With anything of this nature where you you know as a person says like oh my god. Oh my god a porn
00:29:21 Yeah, it's just because they're young with a bokeh no hero academia characters. They're like. Oh my god. They're like canonically 14
00:29:27 Stop guys. It's not even that it's unreal age. It's it's that they're just like they they are
00:29:34 um
00:29:35 Young themselves and they're like they maybe not like they've seen some porn and like oh, I don't know whether I like this yet
00:29:42 And pokemon is for young people lots of sure ages are gonna be looking at pokemon related things and then uh-oh
00:29:49 You know they stumble across something that is sexualized and they're like oh god damn it again
00:29:55 I you know for them the only other time this has happened is the last time that they noticed
00:30:01 Uh, which is like, I don't know
00:30:03 Some game that came maybe undertale or something or delta room
00:30:06 Like that was the first time it happened for them and they're like what the fuck the second time it's pokemon
00:30:11 And then they're complaining even more when you talk about the first time they became sexually aware while playing undertale
00:30:16 Is that no no, I mean like I mean like the first time that they've seen rule 34 stuff
00:30:21 Of things like they've just become a teenager
00:30:25 In that would understand that that's fucked up maybe
00:30:28 And that they would have a problem dealing with it
00:30:31 And it's like I
00:30:33 I can't you know
00:30:35 I can't get too mad about the people getting mad about it because I don't know how old they are and I can assume that you know
00:30:43 They're just kicking up a stink because they're a kid
00:30:46 The way I don't know it seems to me like there's some older people, but here's a question
00:30:50 Let's just say there's like you've got whatever misty, right?
00:30:53 She's she is canonically like 10 or 12 or whatever 12
00:30:56 I draw a sexualized picture of misty and say next to it misty age 25
00:31:02 And now she's got the big the zongas and the big booty like okay, then we're like, oh, this is fine
00:31:08 I guess what if I just erase age 25 next door and it's like, oh my god
00:31:13 You've sexualized this 10 year old as like a big sexy baby
00:31:17 Stick if you if you draw a stick figure and just say oh, that's a five year old then that's
00:31:22 Like I'm I'm over this topic. I don't I don't believe I don't believe that anyone actually cares as much as you're saying they care
00:31:30 I also agree with that. I don't believe anyone really cares about anything
00:31:33 I think that everyone in the world is just constantly virtue signaling about everything
00:31:36 I don't believe that anyone actually has any stake in any of these bullshit fucking issues
00:31:42 I hope so like they'd say like oh
00:31:45 This is fucked up right and then like in brackets the inner thoughts
00:31:49 I kind of like it though, but I don't want anybody to know. I don't want my friends to know
00:31:53 And then in smaller brackets inside those brackets
00:31:56 They think but if I see someone else doing this then maybe I can get somebody else publicly shamed and yeah
00:32:02 That's when someone's life. He I'm getting a lot of this from threads on 4chan
00:32:06 Where people like it is the place where you just attempt to like fuck other people up and insult them and make them feel bad about stuff
00:32:14 So maybe not the best sources though. I know there are some real people who feel this way. I know it is a fact, but
00:32:20 Uh, maybe they are a small minority who deserve to be shoveled into a fucking hole in the ground and shot with a rifle
00:32:27 Yeah
00:32:28 Okay, well that was the thing I wanted to say about shield chan and you know what?
00:32:32 I'm gonna fucking jack off to shield chan after this podcast
00:32:35 I don't give a fuck if people can suck my dick when you've jack off to shield hero
00:32:40 Yeah, maybe I will when you say shield chan. I think you're talking about someone from shield hero
00:32:44 Reftalia because I don't know anything about shield hero. I'll go jack off to her too
00:32:48 And you know what as the loli as a fucking loli slave because I don't give a shit. That's how I feel people
00:32:54 This is a protest fap. That's what I'm going to do and you can't stop me
00:33:00 All right
00:33:03 Hell yeah
00:33:04 Hell yeah, um
00:33:07 I've got a
00:33:08 I've got a gross story
00:33:10 If if if you're all if you're all okay with a bit of gross stories. I'm ready
00:33:15 We've been talking a lot about poop lately. So I feel prepared. Yeah. Well, this involves poop. I'm hopeful. Oh, no
00:33:22 So, all right, so I've been the last few days
00:33:25 Uh, got a cold. Whoops. It's the it's the cold that goes around and everyone's getting it
00:33:30 The family got it. I got it. I was like, okay. Well, I've had a thousand calls at this point
00:33:34 I know how to deal with the cold you drink a lot of water
00:33:37 You don't be stupid and that then it goes away and that's fine
00:33:42 um
00:33:44 This cold caused a different problem which has made me
00:33:49 Bedridden almost almost bedridden and it's really fucked me up
00:33:54 And here's what happens
00:33:56 So when you have a cold you get dehydrated really quickly you need to drink water because your body is like drying up
00:34:02 I don't know exactly why
00:34:03 But you feel dry all the time your lips get chapped and you're like, oh
00:34:08 If need a drink so you have a drink
00:34:10 And then you go to bed
00:34:12 I go to bed and then through the night I become crusty and withered and dusty and
00:34:18 Everything's fucked. Yeah, I wake up and I'm like, oh
00:34:22 No, yeah, yeah, and and in my intestine like a beast whale
00:34:27 Yeah, in my in my in my gut things that have been digesting
00:34:31 Have solidified into like a a brick
00:34:35 And this is you know, this is like, ah shit sucks, you know, similar to
00:34:40 You know Nate's problem a while ago, but I knew I shouldn't eat a lot of carrots. That's what I shouldn't do
00:34:46 Yeah
00:34:47 Um, so I was like, okay. Well, I know how to deal with this as well. I've had this happen a lot
00:34:51 Uh, you just you drink a lot of water and you do the the things you eat the right food
00:34:57 I I had some lens sips, uh, because of the cold
00:35:01 Oh, uh, uh, night will probably be the equivalent
00:35:04 Okay, uh medical drink
00:35:07 I had some of those and I was like, that's good hot water
00:35:10 That's good for clearing stuff out and then I was like, I'll have some tea as well
00:35:14 And you know what I'll have some milk in my tea because
00:35:16 Uh milk makes me burp and that that means that it's good for indigestion for digesting things, right? That's good
00:35:24 Yeah, it's incorrect completely incorrect. I had way too much milky teas and caffeine
00:35:29 Because I was trying to work through the sickness and I ended up doing quite a lot of work on the first day
00:35:34 but then I went to bed again
00:35:36 And uh, this was the worst night of my life
00:35:39 At least in 2019. Are you sure?
00:35:42 uh
00:35:44 So basically every five minutes I would have to get up to take an hour's long shit
00:35:50 And I was I was sitting there in the toilet with my legs up on on the seat
00:35:55 Straining nothing was happening. Oh my god. Yeah. Uh, it was like, okay
00:36:00 This is you know, it's one thing to be constipated. It's another thing to also have a headache and be dehydrated
00:36:06 from a cold that
00:36:07 Your throat is sore and you're sneezing really loudly so so loudly so consistently
00:36:13 That my rib cage started aching because of how much my lungs were expanding and contracting sneezing so loudly
00:36:19 Yeah
00:36:21 So I was like
00:36:24 And so
00:36:25 You know
00:36:26 It sucks and then the milk started to to react with all the stuff that was going on. I was the milk anything
00:36:32 Yeah, I milk I I was you know going back to bed after like not shitting anything out and like
00:36:38 Moving around trying to jostle at it. You know, you know the stuff sure
00:36:42 But then the milk started bubbling and creating a pockets of gas
00:36:48 And I started burping and I started burping a lot and I started farting a lot and I started burping and farting a lot
00:36:53 And it was really it was really satisfying when I got one of those farts out because like my butthole was like there was a brick in the way
00:36:59 Yeah, I know sure. Yeah, I would have killed for a fart during when I was constipated. Yeah, it was like it's like
00:37:04 It's
00:37:06 Like one of those so I was like, oh well god damn thanks for that, but there's not enough and I keep burping
00:37:12 Um, it's like 2 a.m. I'm still going to the toilet every five minutes. It's agony
00:37:17 I'm really need sleep and I can't have it
00:37:21 And then I start burping some more and the burps start to taste acidic and I'm like
00:37:27 Well, here it comes here it comes
00:37:31 Well, well well
00:37:33 Look who dropped in and I I I go turn around and I I up chuck fuck spew
00:37:41 All of my last dinner just happened to be fish and chips, which uh, I like it's very delicious
00:37:48 I know which is probably why it was so bad. Uh, I vomited it all out. It was very very loud and fish oil
00:37:55 It was it was very loud. I was screaming like
00:37:58 Oh
00:38:00 It came out my nose and everything and it was oh my god for real. Holy shit. Yeah, it was one of those big ones
00:38:06 But like Jesus Christ after I know that after
00:38:09 Vomiting you feel a little better, right? Because it's the problem's gone that stuff is out
00:38:15 Not the case because I still had the cold and I was still I was still bunged up down downstairs
00:38:22 And now what a phrase now what I had
00:38:26 Right is I had acid
00:38:29 Going up my throat that was already sore from sneezing and coughing
00:38:33 So now I had double acid burn ouch on my throat
00:38:38 And in my nose because I had so much mucus it caught a lot of the vomit
00:38:43 And for like the last the the next like 30 minutes
00:38:46 I was blowing my nose and bits of fish and chip were like coming out in clumps
00:38:52 It was terrible
00:38:57 Well, and um and then uh, I still couldn't shit. I I woke up the dog
00:39:01 I think by by vomiting so how I'm really like I'm happy that the dog was cared about me
00:39:06 And he heard me vomiting and he started barking like oh no. Oh no. What's going on?
00:39:11 And that woke up my mom and she came and gave me some water and it was like, okay
00:39:16 Uh, shit
00:39:17 Terrible
00:39:18 And so I it was like 5 a.m. By the time I actually managed to fall asleep
00:39:24 After that it was you know not no more burping
00:39:27 So it was just sort of like pain constantly and I managed to not fall asleep really and then
00:39:32 Today I have been basically doing nothing and staring at my screen and thinking
00:39:39 Maybe maybe I could at least you know play a video game
00:39:44 If I can't work on anything maybe I could play a video game. I can't even play a video game
00:39:48 My head's hurt so much. I can't even watch a youtube video. I was watching a red letter media thing
00:39:52 I was like
00:39:53 Shut up
00:39:54 Shut up
00:39:56 Shut up. I turned it off and then I was sitting around and I was just like god damn it
00:40:01 Fuck
00:40:02 And that's my story
00:40:03 Oh, and then I started being on the podcast
00:40:06 Hooray
00:40:07 I'm glad you're still alive though
00:40:09 I want to quickly say though like now to prevent all of that that for people who are ill
00:40:14 Don't eat dairy products like the only dairy product you could you could you could eat
00:40:19 It's probably like a yogurt, but not like those flavored whatever fake yogurts. It's like a plain Greek yogurt or something
00:40:25 Yeah, yeah, naturally yogurt. Those are good for you
00:40:28 It's not like not only was I having like milky tea, but like I do some weed
00:40:34 I mean that might have worked
00:40:38 But like I I accidentally why didn't accidentally I stupidly had a slice of new this new lovely cheesecake that was in the fridge
00:40:45 It's like ah lovely big slice
00:40:49 It was delicious and I didn't even realize and then I was looking up later like what not to do when you're ill and
00:40:55 Constipated and sneezing and it was like don't don't milk. No, and I was like, oh
00:41:00 Do not let the milk you don't
00:41:02 Cows of the world rest your milk at the old milk mill
00:41:05 It's it's because it's difficult to digest dairy products and like when you're ill and have a fever your
00:41:13 Um stomach just sort of shuts down
00:41:15 Yeah, you know the pH changes in your stomach and you can't digest
00:41:20 This segues perfectly into what I wanted to talk about which is ice cream snacks
00:41:27 All right
00:41:28 Listen, okay, so everyone knows that I'm post food and I hate food
00:41:32 Um, but I make an exception. I'm interested for his tasty ice cream snacks. They're so good. No, no, listen
00:41:40 I make an exception. Uh, I'm I'm intellectually curious about like
00:41:46 No, shut up. I'm serious
00:41:49 Stop laughing
00:41:51 I'm I'm intellectually curious about like
00:41:54 Weird snack foods that other countries have that I've never heard of and I heard about one
00:41:59 From australia. It is okay. Well, first of all, I found out that in australia. They call popsicles icy poles
00:42:06 Which I thought was really funny wrong
00:42:11 Well, that's wrong. Just gotta update that this is not a popsicle
00:42:14 It's it's one of those ice cream on a stick type deals. Uh, and it is called the golden gay time
00:42:20 Oh, I've heard of it. Yeah, and their slogan is
00:42:23 It's hard to have a gay time on your own
00:42:28 True, so contrary. It looks really good
00:42:31 It's like it looks like butterscotch. I mean, I'm guessing it's like butterscotch and vanilla or caramel and vanilla ice cream
00:42:37 It looks like it's ice cream products from other countries and have it survive the trip
00:42:41 Maybe and and it looks like and it looks like it's coated in like crushed heath or butterscotch or something
00:42:47 I don't know, but they got other flavors, right? Let me read you a couple of these other flavors. They got
00:42:51 Um
00:42:53 They got unicorn flavor. Nice. That's gay. They got real gay. They got if you like pina colada flavor
00:43:01 And they got choc mint mc mint face
00:43:07 And uh, last one again, australia
00:43:10 Is it I okay now like did body mc vote phase get named after it or did it got named after
00:43:16 Body mc vote phase or is it just a coincidence?
00:43:19 I don't know what that is. I think people have always just been putting something mix something face on things
00:43:25 It's like a weird stupid human thing
00:43:29 This compulsion does something mix something face everything they see
00:43:32 It's just really weird that you would be like we got to make a new flavor of our of our highly coveted ice cream bar
00:43:38 And we're gonna call it and we're gonna make a chocolate mint flavor. We're gonna call it choc mint mc mint face
00:43:44 Is this like some millennial shit infiltrating the company mc donald's face stupid names? I don't know. I don't know
00:43:50 The new mc donald's burger burger mc burger face. It's just like it's got like five patties this time
00:43:56 And then and then they start a twitter account that is burger mc burger face and the burger is tweeting at other burgers
00:44:03 I refuse to let my generation take the fall for stupid names as if we invented them. Okay
00:44:08 I mean, you know older generations caught a bunch of shrimp and called them sea monkeys
00:44:14 That's that's wrong. That's not correct at all. That's incorrect. Yeah, that's fair. They're not they're not monkeys
00:44:19 They're not even part of the great eight family
00:44:23 Check the genus and file on you dunces. Jesus christ
00:44:26 Yeah, they did it. They did it for the marketing thing so for the lulls
00:44:30 I think I heard I think I saw a video about the sea monkeys guy and I think he was like a nazi or something
00:44:35 I think he was like a real big eugenicist or something really cool
00:44:39 He was a scammer through and through
00:44:42 Yeah
00:44:43 That stuff. I think he was hoping to use those. No, I think he was a kkk. I think he was like a keynote kkk
00:44:49 A key a keto kkk. Is that what kkk is very sensible? No, he was not one of us. Keto kido kido kido kido kido kids club
00:44:55 Yeah, that's what it is
00:44:57 Fuck yeah
00:44:59 You gotta start a brand new shirt the keto kids club
00:45:04 It just says kkk. You know, yeah
00:45:06 I have a strong urge a lot of the time to tweet things about being in the cool kid like in a video
00:45:12 I say that I say I say the cool kids club all the time and I want to as a joke write kkk on screen
00:45:18 But then I know like oh Jesus here we go with this guy wanting to kill all minorities and you know
00:45:25 Well, that's yeah, you know classic Nate bestman
00:45:28 You know what I'm annoyed about is that I can't I can't make I mean obviously you can't make racy jokes anymore, but like
00:45:36 It's this
00:45:37 You can but like people will not assume that you were joking. They will assume that you're one of those people who actually think it
00:45:45 And you have an argument with them. It was like I'm just I was just being you know
00:45:49 Exaggerated for effect, you know for a comedy thing and then they like reply with oh, I was just pretending to be retarded
00:45:56 Well, shut up. Oh, right. They're saying that you are in fact like obfuscating your true intentions now after the fact
00:46:03 You've been criticized or you're like you're normalizing like you're you're normalizing this this hateful language or
00:46:10 Yeah, I mean, I don't mean really that's what they do on 4chan or whatever like it's all memes, but it's not actually
00:46:17 Yeah, I guess like I don't even mind the normalizing thing. It's just like I would like to not have people
00:46:23 Assume things of me based on
00:46:26 Jokes I make so I guess I'll just stop making those jokes
00:46:29 I mean you go you go you go to you go to poll you go on poll and it's all you know everyone's like ha ha
00:46:37 So funny to joke about how the jews control everything, but you know, but they kind of actually do though like yeah, but you know
00:46:43 They kind of we kind of actually believe this fine. That's fine. Well, I mean I mean they do but it is a joke
00:46:50 sure
00:46:51 But like like to me it's
00:46:53 It's funny that the world is so fucked that like secret societies control everything and that we're all complete slaves
00:46:59 And we're all fucking doomed and society is going to collapse and the and the super wealthy
00:47:04 Will stamp their feet on our necks for all time. I mean like you just got to laugh at it
00:47:09 Did you guys see by any chance reminds me about the world going to hell?
00:47:13 Anyone see the the jewellery I mean I'm talking about people being racist like scary racist like
00:47:18 This the real yeah, I know what you mean like I know what you mean though like
00:47:22 Sure, like I don't know means like ha ha aren't aren't black people stupid
00:47:26 But then like also like but it is cool that the cops shoot him a lot
00:47:31 I mean, yeah, I feel I feel like the cultural battle
00:47:35 Look, I'm sure people would disagree and I don't have a ton of life experience in these areas
00:47:38 But like I feel that the whole racism issue
00:47:42 Is is at a point where it's less of a problem for the world than like
00:47:47 I don't know the suppression of global communities and like the control of the population by technocrats
00:47:53 That's what I've done with racism as an issue completely like I'm over it. It's solved as far as I'm concerned
00:48:00 I'm done pretending that racism is a problem. I'm done pretending that it's bad like it's it's funny
00:48:07 Fuck off racism. It's funny. Everybody suck my fucking dick. It's funny
00:48:12 I mean
00:48:14 I get it. I'm not a minority
00:48:17 People get shot out there in the real world
00:48:20 People definitely get shot and it's fucked up and you know what maybe even there's like some racist stuff going on
00:48:25 That makes people more likely to shoot like a black dude who's just walking down the street than a white dude
00:48:29 Totally fair. Totally fair. Um, I don't know don't mistake internet for real life. Just please
00:48:37 Because in real life in real life, I'm pretty sure racism is a lot, you know
00:48:41 scarier and and more threatening than someone
00:48:49 I just I just hate I just hate this idea that people have this completely insane
00:48:55 ludicrous notion
00:48:57 Literally a ludicrous notion like the rapper who is a black man
00:49:01 This notion that like if you say something racist, then you're racist. That's not how it works
00:49:07 Like if you oh, yeah, you've made some pretty good points on that in the past
00:49:10 If you believe something racist you're racist if you do something racist you're racist if you say something racist
00:49:15 You're just being cool. Well, it's fucking funny. Okay. I mean, I get you I get you
00:49:19 But like say you're you're an outside observer and you hear someone say something racist
00:49:25 Like it's like hippo was saying you're not it's not crazy in this day and age to think that this person making this joke
00:49:32 Actually believes the thing that he's making because people do it all the time
00:49:35 Well, that's how the problem there is just this Trump got elected
00:49:38 Well, yeah, but the problem there is just this epidemic of mass retardation where nobody can decipher context anymore
00:49:43 Or nobody can understand when somebody is clearly obviously not
00:49:48 The context has been deliberately obfuscated
00:49:51 Ben, please clarify what you just meant about that's how Trump got elected because I I don't understand what your point
00:49:56 What I think Trump got okay. I will clarify what I mean by that is that
00:50:01 Fucking everyone thought it was real funny and a real funny meme to be a white nationalist and
00:50:07 That's what happened because it was a real fun. Trump is not a white nationalist
00:50:11 No, but like the people who voted for him. Yeah, I'm confused about
00:50:17 Like I get what you're laying down. We're I we're kind of talking about two different things here, but I get you
00:50:22 Well, I mean, I'm just saying from an outs
00:50:25 Pete people
00:50:27 You know, there's people that make jokes to be funny and there's people that make jokes
00:50:31 So that they can say what they actually believe without having to answer for the consequences of it
00:50:36 I guess so I I mean, I suppose that's totally fair. I'm sure there's people like that. You can't you can't know you can't know
00:50:42 Who's who okay, but but I think the solution there is
00:50:46 I would get what people would disagree with this
00:50:47 But like I think it's very important to give people the benefit of the doubt
00:50:52 Without a substantial case to make your like if you want to insinuate. Okay, let's say, you know
00:50:56 Louis CK has said hard rn words on occasion. Okay. Let's make the case that Louis CK is racist
00:51:02 Um, he said the word. Well, you're saying that you can infer things from what you know about. No, you fool
00:51:07 I'm saying that you can't know. I'm saying that you might suspect. I'm saying that you might have reason to believe
00:51:13 I'm sure you can't. Yeah
00:51:16 You never know you never know that's what I'm saying
00:51:18 I I get your point and I mean, yeah, I get it
00:51:21 Like if all you know about if you know nothing about someone except that, you know, they they called a black guy hard rn word once
00:51:27 Okay, you know starting to make a pretty decent case there. Um, but uh, I don't know like maybe it was in fact a joke
00:51:33 And that was like his best friend like that's you know possible
00:51:36 So you got to you know dig into it more and I just don't like the jumping to conclusions
00:51:40 We see a lot of the time. Why are you fucking take and I'm not this point is no longer rebutting your point
00:51:45 I am now extrapolating my mouth. Okay, fine. Yeah. Yeah. All right
00:51:50 Remember how the time Count Dankulous life was absolutely ruined because he made a joke about a pug
00:51:56 See that's what I'm talking about. I actually don't know who Count Dankulous
00:52:00 How is that true?
00:52:02 What do you mean? How is that true? He's a Scottish guy who made a youtube video about his uh,
00:52:08 his friends and he is his girlfriend's pug and you know as like a little bit of cheeky revenge
00:52:14 She taught it how to do a nazi salute. Well, no, it's just like racist paw
00:52:19 Like instead of like well, yeah. Yeah, instead of using the word really cute. Yeah, and and like like
00:52:25 He obviously like in the video said
00:52:27 um, I'm not a racist lol
00:52:30 Uh, but this is like the worst thing I can think of to to make this pug say so it's like
00:52:36 Do but people just took it as like you just wanted to make a pug a nazi
00:52:41 And the thing is like a nazi
00:52:43 He only had like four or so subscribers only his friends and it was just for his girlfriend and his friends
00:52:48 But it became it started circulating it became way more popular than it ever was meant to be
00:52:55 And yeah, he was convicted of a crime. He was yeah convicted and like and like the the the um
00:53:01 When he went to court they decided in the end just like let's
00:53:05 Not look at the context in which he said the thing and just focus on the fact that he said the thing
00:53:11 And he he got he was guilty and then like this but that's britain. Thank god
00:53:15 You know your hellhole of a home country. So thank god for that. I mean, it's not just britain
00:53:21 I mean not you know
00:53:22 It that the the whole idea is that that kind of retardation could spread and it clears you well, of course, of course
00:53:28 I mean, that's my issue is just that nobody
00:53:31 Is even capable of looking at context anymore people are so fucked in the head
00:53:35 You know, I probably because of social media and the you know words like polarization and whatever the fuck you want
00:53:41 To blame it on but people are just fucking stupid or now. That's the you know, I do agree with that
00:53:45 I think that's definitely like
00:53:47 My annoyance is that with racism is just there seems to be like no
00:53:53 acceptance or no room for the archie bunkers of the world anymore like
00:53:58 That's true. What do you mean?
00:54:00 And all what's an archie bunker the old 70s sitcom all in the family
00:54:03 It was like a show about this old conservative dad and his family was his
00:54:07 His daughter and his stepson were more progressive and they clashed and his whole thing was that you know, he was low key racist
00:54:14 And he said, you know mean things but he was like a good man. He had a good heart
00:54:17 He was friends with george jefferson who was black, you know, he like grew over the course of the series
00:54:21 He's like, ah george one of the good ones, you know, he was
00:54:24 He's a good guy like the whole point is that like you can be sort of low-key backwards and racist and still be a good person
00:54:31 It's not the end. I'll be all of what makes you
00:54:33 Think a lot of people your words are the human being these days. Yeah, but a lot of people are stupid because like yeah, like
00:54:39 Like like I grew up in like a really small like backwoods fucking hodunk
00:54:44 You know white people town and I grew up
00:54:47 You know poor and I grew up around a lot of like low-key racism, you know
00:54:51 Like people would talk. Ah, you know blacks and mexicans. Ah, you know, you know
00:54:55 My grandma would talk about blacks. My you know, my grandma we grew up. I always thought
00:55:01 I I truly believed for most of my life that brazilian nuts were called nigger toes
00:55:06 That's what they that's what they were called when I was a kid. Everyone called them that
00:55:11 So, you know, you you grow up and you go somewhere and you and you go sit down at a bar and you go
00:55:16 Oh, I want some of them nigger toes in my mouth people look at you like you're crazy and you're like
00:55:19 It's what my grandma called them. I don't know
00:55:21 You know like my grandma used to my grandma used to say that's not even particularly insulting though, obviously
00:55:26 It's you know, there's baggage in like words, of course. It's funny like my grandma used to say stuff like
00:55:32 God made the niggers. He made them in the night. He made them so fast. He forgot to make them white
00:55:40 And like I don't even know what to think about that
00:55:43 Like it's funny laughing at the racism people that's what I'm laughing at just to clarify
00:55:47 Like because it's fucking funny. It's just ridiculous to me that you can't even say funny. Shit like that. That doesn't that doesn't hurt anybody
00:55:54 It's fucking funny. Yeah, you know people. It's pretty funny. Oh, it's normalizing views that like God made them wrong
00:56:01 Like no, it's just fucking silly and stupid. It's funny because it's ridiculous
00:56:05 I mean it gets into this thing of like like if you make a joke like that like, okay
00:56:09 percentage-wise, maybe it's like 99 funny joke, but then there's like that one percent. It's like, hey, yeah
00:56:16 Yeah, it do be like it is
00:56:20 You're you're you're normalizing racism like no, I mean, yeah, that's the
00:56:24 But like how can it be normalizing racism when like people are less racist than they were 200 years ago?
00:56:29 Yeah, maybe maybe they're they're a minority. I mean, I think they're a minority
00:56:33 I'm scared of everything
00:56:35 Um, but like, you know the the people the people that like really hate minorities or whatever like the way that they
00:56:46 The way that like they do want to normalize it and the way that they do is through like seemingly innocuous jokes
00:56:53 Like that and like kind of a conspiracy theory though. Yeah, I mean tell obviously
00:56:58 It's obviously that does happen. Yeah, there's people. I mean, it's mostly like teenagers
00:57:04 I think unfortunate yet who like
00:57:07 Are drawn to the memes and then start believing the memes and like start internalizing that. Yes. I agree. That's fine
00:57:13 That's I get all that it's just that in any specific case
00:57:16 Isn't it true that you need to dig deeper to find out which one it is? Is it just a joke or are they you know
00:57:23 So, I don't I don't know. I guess that's all I have to say on it. Okay. I just I just I just
00:57:29 You can say the worst things in the world
00:57:32 Okay, whatever you got my point
00:57:33 I grew up with a lot of like, you know low-key racism, but I never saw anyone actually do
00:57:39 Anything racist or hurt anyone or actually like follow through on some racist belief
00:57:44 It was all racism was always just like a funny fucking joke like and that's what it should be
00:57:49 That's how you that's how you kill racism. You make it a funny fucking joke. You make it a stupid fucking thing that everybody laughs at
00:57:56 I mean, I agree with that for the most part
00:57:58 But you have now you could have a guy be like a philanthropist like a
00:58:02 Great man who does great things you could have him like give the charity his whole life
00:58:05 But then like he slips up and one day he gets caught talking about coons, you know, he's he's just says something funny
00:58:11 And there was that there was that guy on the weather
00:58:13 Remember that guy on the weather channel who accidentally said he said like martin luther coon jr
00:58:17 Like he just made a mistake and like they tried to fire him. He had to like, you know, do a bunch of bullshit
00:58:23 And it's like well, remember remember pewdiepie. He he said the word while being angry and then he apologized immediately
00:58:30 And then like yeah, everyone just got on his case
00:58:33 Yeah, and all this time on the internet right in like in a whole decade of like uploading almost daily
00:58:40 He messed up once
00:58:42 Yeah, like all it does is is is saying the wrong thing and suddenly all the good you've ever done in your life is washed away
00:58:48 You're just a racist. That's all you are. You're a piece of shit. Go to hell
00:58:52 I don't know like a bad and I get your point, but I feel
00:58:56 No, this whole thing. No, we need to like sense. We need to get fucking
00:59:00 No, shut up. You can't fucking argue with my point because my only point is that x happens
00:59:05 And unless you're gonna fucking stand there and tell me no, that doesn't happen. You're not arguing with me
00:59:10 Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's true
00:59:13 I just don't think that way I guess
00:59:16 Well, like the the biggest problem is that I don't want to see bad things
00:59:19 I want to see good things so I choose to focus on that which maybe is bad and maybe is wrong
00:59:24 um
00:59:25 When you decide collectively as a society that
00:59:29 Saying a racist thing is what makes you a racist or like saying the words the magic fucking words
00:59:34 If you say the words you're a racist when when we start deciding that and we start going after people, you know for words
00:59:40 You know people who are actually bad people are smart. They know how to hide
00:59:45 So the people who are not saying the words are going to end up being the ones who are racist because the ones who really have these
00:59:50 Beliefs are going to know how to hide and not say the magic fucking words
00:59:54 And the people who aren't racist are the ones who because they're not racist
00:59:58 They don't think they have to be careful or I don't know and they just fucking slip, you know people fucking
01:00:02 So what's going to happen is that the real bad people are going to slip through the cracks and not get called out
01:00:08 While all the regular people are going to get called out for saying funny things and saying the wrong fucking words
01:00:12 I mean, I guess to be fair and eventually there'll be nothing left
01:00:15 But bad people I mean that I suppose like even if we adopted that belief
01:00:19 It's like, okay, then we could just have people running around just like throwing racial slurs willy nilly and like
01:00:23 Okay, then people would just do it out in the open and like that I think we should I think I think everybody should be out
01:00:29 Throwing around racial slurs willy nilly and making a fucking joke about it
01:00:32 Everyone should be fucking, you know like like an old when you see like old comedy movies from the 70s like airplane
01:00:38 You know there's like racist humor all over there's you know and everyone's getting along and everyone's fucking laughing
01:00:43 Everyone laughs at those movies, you know
01:00:45 When when when when an airplane when they have the joke about the old lady speaking in ebonics and and it's like it's really exaggerated
01:00:52 Super racist ebonics. It's hilarious and everybody understands or like blazing saddles where they say nigger like fucking
01:00:58 11,000 times in that movie and the whole movie is about racism
01:01:02 But like it's funny and because it's funny it brings people together and everyone laughs at it and goes ha ha
01:01:07 Racism sure is ridiculous and stupid. That's what we need
01:01:09 We need more racism out in the open so that we can laugh at it
01:01:13 Instead of having to shove it in the fucking corner and hide it like it's something to be ashamed of and hidden
01:01:17 Or else we get shunned from fucking society if we say the wrong fucking magic word
01:01:21 There's my rant for the day word. I'll let I'm not I'm not above laughing at a racist joke. I'm just putting that out there
01:01:28 I know I know one racist joke back from my childhood, but I'm not yeah
01:01:33 Let it fly I can I can I can type it out and you guys can read it out, but I don't want to see
01:01:39 Sure go for it. Go for it. That's fine. It's like
01:01:42 I guess it's sort of racist, but at the same time it's like
01:01:45 It's making fun of both sides. I think so. Okay. What's the targeted demographic here of the
01:01:51 I I couldn't say like let me just type it out. I'm sorry for the typing noises. Uh hippo
01:01:56 That's fine. Maybe maybe he'll edit it out. He's a good boy. He knows how to do this thing. Yeah, okay
01:02:01 Uh, I guess uh, uh, you know a really good way to to to not be racist
01:02:07 I don't I don't because it because it haunts it's because it's
01:02:11 I know you're looking for this. I know you're walking a tight
01:02:14 You're always you're constantly walking a tightrope
01:02:16 And if you ever slip you ever slip you'll fall into the abyss of racism and you can never get out of it
01:02:21 It's just like being gay with chris chan
01:02:23 Yeah, like if you like it's just it's a constant struggle to avoid being gay
01:02:26 You got it. You got it. You got to you got to really work it
01:02:29 You got to really strain that straightness muscle here's a thought
01:02:32 I do think literally every person in the world is racist
01:02:35 Um, because when everyone has like, I don't know you think about a factor
01:02:40 I don't know. How about being italian that brings to mind some things that you mean are italian humans definitely have like
01:02:47 Tribalistic instincts. Thank god. I had an italian like me in the media in the form of mario
01:02:53 Thank god. I had mario to relate to someone who looked like me. You know ben
01:02:57 I'm offended by mario because not all italians are mustache wearing, you know plumber low blue collar workers
01:03:05 My father or my mother was an educated woman and she was italian. God. How dare they
01:03:11 God rest your soul. Yeah
01:03:13 I don't know. It's all we've talked about this a million welcome to the pokemon episode. Yeah, we talk about race relations and racism
01:03:20 mule tool tenacral aerodactyl
01:03:23 mule tool
01:03:24 It's a mule tool put a mule and a tool this episode is going to be called
01:03:28 Episode episode 150 pokemon and then in parentheses the n word is used 11 times in this episode
01:03:35 Just like in most pokemon games. We should put a trigger warning on
01:03:41 It's like now that i'm translating it from luffianian to english. This is a very stupid joke
01:03:47 Most of them are I think I remember the best kind you told the joke you told like no, it was like it was a gay joke
01:03:54 It was oh boy. Oh wait. I'm thinking I think i'm thinking of like you told a lithuanian fairy tale and it like didn't make any sense
01:04:01 Oh with the with the sausage
01:04:03 Yes, yeah
01:04:04 Someone just like became a sausage. No. No. No. Someone was already a sausage. It was a was a sentient sausage. Yes
01:04:11 Yeah, sure
01:04:13 um
01:04:15 I respect your culture. What can you do? What can you do? A little we just got to oppress the gays?
01:04:20 Um, that's all there is to it really fact true fact a little while ago
01:04:25 I heard in my headphones a little beep that signaled that uh ten paces in draw is rendered
01:04:32 It is done. I think I will put it up after this episode
01:04:37 Uh, if anyone would want to like peruse it and see if there anything sucks about it
01:04:41 Okay, I think of the audio mixing or something. I tried really hard to keep the audio mixed as well as I could
01:04:48 Think I did an okay job
01:04:50 It's hype uh the ending the ending of ten paces in draw is fucking hype. It's a yeah, it's a blast
01:04:56 It is a blast and how long is it? It's about an hour long. It's like just under an hour
01:05:01 It's like a motion picture. God damn it is it has a it's a you know
01:05:06 I mean, I hate it because I've been looking at it for months and months and I'm fucking sick of working on it
01:05:12 uh, but uh
01:05:14 It's got you know, I used um oblivion falls
01:05:18 redo of the of jesse's uh pcp theme song and it's
01:05:23 Really fun and cool
01:05:26 Uh, so yeah, watch if watch that I would recommend viewers. It's yeah, this is from this is footage from radcon two
01:05:34 Uh
01:05:35 It was a thing it was like a little side project
01:05:37 We came me and munchie came up with it on the fly and then we all we all just did it
01:05:41 Wait, you mean radcon three, right? Did I say two? I meant three. Yeah. Yeah, it's from radcon three
01:05:46 Yeah, that's dope. So that's finally and it's a pilot. I mean
01:05:51 You're will be looking for feedback to see potentially if more could be made or some fact
01:05:55 The idea was that it was a pilot episode that we could do more of I mean, this is a thing that's out like a thing
01:06:01 That's coming out. It's it's it's just I just finished it. So it'll be out soon
01:06:06 um the
01:06:08 Yeah, the idea for it was a pilot. Um, I mean
01:06:11 Obviously because that was done at a radcon and like
01:06:15 I mean
01:06:17 If we did more of them, they would look they would look a little different and they might be formatted a little differently
01:06:21 But yeah, we could definitely like
01:06:24 I mean, I would definitely make some changes to the premise. I would
01:06:28 Fuck I would give more time for each round and we would have more to work with and fucking ballpoint pens. I think
01:06:35 But yeah, yeah, the the concept is definitely something that could be
01:06:40 Expanded upon and made more of
01:06:44 Uh, yeah, well, that's so that's neat in terms of radcon three content
01:06:50 Content three. We've got what what's left. Okay. I'm good. I'm gonna read this
01:06:55 I'm gonna read this joke out loud without reading it beforehand. So if it's if I say something horrible
01:07:01 It's not my fault. I have no idea what I'm about to say. Okay
01:07:04 Let's see here
01:07:06 A white guy and a black guy. I read a bar the white guy turns to the black guy and says
01:07:11 Do you know why your feet are white? The black guy says nothing just takes a drink of his beer
01:07:16 The white guy continues because you stood on your feet when I painted you he laughed
01:07:22 And then asked again
01:07:23 Know why your palms are white the black guy says nothing the white guy continues
01:07:28 Because you stood on your hands when I painted you he laughed
01:07:33 The black guy finishes his drink and stands up speaking. Well, you know why your asshole is dark
01:07:39 The white guy looks at him the black guy continues because the paint wasn't dry when I fucked you
01:07:46 He then pays for his drink
01:07:49 Uh, I think I'm getting the gist here. They're painters
01:07:53 And there was like, okay
01:07:55 No, I think the idea is that like they're just skin will like wipe off on other
01:08:01 Did you guys not get it? Are you what's happening? I don't get it. I don't get it
01:08:07 I don't get what the white guy's talking about in the first. I don't know. The white guy is just
01:08:11 It's just two guys in a bar, you know, you know, busting each other's balls
01:08:14 I assume as you do. Yeah, the white guy is you know saying some low-key race to the black guy like hey
01:08:19 Hey, you're black. You know what black people are fucking your feet and hands are white and painted you
01:08:22 And then the black guy turns it around on them and it's like, oh, yeah
01:08:24 Well, your asshole's dark because I fucked in it and the paint wasn't dry. I made it dark. Oh, wait, wait, wait
01:08:30 Oh
01:08:32 Like the souls like talking about like the souls of his oh, yeah, I get it. I get it
01:08:37 I was gonna be like his but his feet aren't white. What do you talk? Okay?
01:08:41 All right, you know what? This is my favorite kind of race joke because frankly, none of this is actually like offensive
01:08:47 It simply is pointing out like facts that person
01:08:52 And even in the context of the joke, it's just like a white guy and a black guy who are obviously hanging out together
01:08:57 And they're clearly friends. So
01:08:59 There you go. And then there's banter and he gets me hoists his own petard at the end there
01:09:05 Yeah, good
01:09:06 But when did he paint him?
01:09:10 Don't ask me like this hardly analyzing
01:09:14 The black guy not know he was being painted by the white guy. This is not this is not an origin of creation story
01:09:20 We didn't literally it's just the guys busting each other's balls and making shit up
01:09:24 Hey, hey everypony and welcome back to another episode of thoroughly analyzing mage's racist joke. We got another one here today
01:09:32 This joke's like a strong
01:09:34 Eight
01:09:35 No, that's too high. That's too high. I don't know. It's like too dicky. It's like a 1488. I'd say
01:09:43 Got him
01:09:44 um
01:09:45 It was told to me by a drunk guy in a family meeting gathering. I think I don't remember who it was my uncle
01:09:51 Maybe my dad. I don't know someone. It's always a drunk uncle. It's always
01:09:55 I mean, that's my whole point. We have to have some sympathy in this country for the drunk uncles who make up
01:10:00 You know a sizable portion of the population and they're getting
01:10:04 Marginalized we are marginalizing the drunk uncles by making like I had a friend. I hope this racism considered bad
01:10:11 This is similar to that, but it's just that I once had uh, uh, well
01:10:14 I have a friend and his little brother one time they were at the grocery store
01:10:18 And uh, like it was it was his little brother who was like three and his mom
01:10:22 And they were at the grocery store and you know, they're white or whatever and they just walked by a black guy
01:10:27 And the little kid said mommy. Why is that man blue?
01:10:31 And that because he didn't he just fucked up his color. She just doesn't know what and that was hilarious
01:10:35 One of those was it mill smith as from uh from the rabbi's cat when they find the shared ancestors of all blacks and jews
01:10:43 And they're like 20 foot and they're like 20 foot tall giant like blue
01:10:48 Jews that like yeah, yeah
01:10:50 There's the true uh, they're like so dark that they're blue and they and they all and they have they have uh, they have um
01:10:55 Oh, fuck. What's the what's the word when a jewish boy becomes a man?
01:10:59 Ramadan no
01:11:01 Ramadan yeah close enough
01:11:04 Uh, mage. Okay. What's your other joke? Uh, let me type it
01:11:07 Okay, go on go on
01:11:10 Were we
01:11:11 Nate were you were you doing like a round up like a like a radcom three content round up? Did you do that?
01:11:16 Oh, right. I was gonna say yeah, uh, what do you remember? I was like, okay in terms of stuff that's left
01:11:21 I know that gibb has one piece of content left. Uh, ben's finishing 10 bases and draw
01:11:25 I think there's something else that was like, uh, like a reward or something. I can't quite remember
01:11:29 I think there's something else too something. I don't I don't it was a reward tier. Yeah, I can't remember
01:11:34 I'll have to go check. I'll have to go check. But I think there's one other as well
01:11:38 So that's maybe something something something nine thousands
01:11:41 And you know, it's almost uh, by the time this comes out
01:11:44 It'll be pretty close to the like the one-year anniversary of like the end of radcon three might even be past it
01:11:49 Can we march sometime? Can we get it all released within a year of the event?
01:11:54 Do you think it could happen? Well, I know for a fact that gibbs thing will not come out, uh, before like the end of the thing
01:12:00 But you know, uh, frankly, that's his business and I don't care. I'm not involved in that. Oh, wait. Yes. I am
01:12:05 I'm literally in it now that I think about it. Um, well, whatever
01:12:09 He should release it. Is this is a secret what it is
01:12:12 I just want to say just in case he doesn't want to if you can clarify it if he wants, um
01:12:17 Uh, but yeah, so we're we're getting close to the end
01:12:20 And I know I said last time but my god was radcon three such a derailing of like how great things were going for me
01:12:27 In terms of getting my work done on my channel and it's all it's all my fault. I blame no one else
01:12:32 Yeah, but you know same. I can't blame radcon three. It's own. It's no one's fault, but mine
01:12:38 I just I just I signed up for too much shit and it was great. Uh, we made all the stuff almost it'll all be done soon
01:12:45 But uh, I think
01:12:47 I mean, I think I'm done. I think with 10 paces and draw. I'm like done with everything
01:12:53 Technically, I mean you may or may not have a little bit of more work to do on the thing
01:12:57 I'm still working on but you know, I think it's very minimal if anything, so
01:13:01 Fuck yeah, that's that's it. Well, I'm very excited to have that monkey off my back
01:13:06 I cannot wait. Uh, I've got big plans for things to do with my spare time once that is all gone
01:13:13 It's really loomed over me. It's like it's really been a black cloud. Um, yeah, it's it's a nightmare
01:13:18 Just a burden. So not doing this just a disaster. So radcon four
01:13:22 I'm gonna waltz in do a lecture waltz the fuck out and that's all I'll do people can make their vlogs people can
01:13:29 You know other people want to make more complicated content. I want to do
01:13:33 I want to do two lectures at radcon four. Excellent idea. Whenever that happens
01:13:38 I might do like one long one and two short ones
01:13:41 Welcome like mini lectures. Hey Gib. We were just talking about things that remain for radcon three
01:13:46 Uh, I didn't say yours in case you wanted to keep it on the down low
01:13:49 Oh, I mean, I've I've mentioned that it's a thing, but I I don't know whether I'll ever release it
01:13:54 It's the g rpj kingdom hearts two
01:13:57 Which I have the footage for can can I read this one? Can I read mage's next racist joke?
01:14:02 Yeah, please. Uh, remember, uh, the attitudes expressed in this joke are not mine. They are mages not mine
01:14:08 They're just jokes. I remember
01:14:11 Uh, a white person and a black person are talking the black person is ranting
01:14:16 Tell me this so when you're cold your skin turns blue when you're embarrassed your skin turns pink
01:14:22 When you're angry your skin turns red when your nauseous your skin turns green
01:14:26 And when you're tan your skin turns orange and you say, I'm the person of color with you
01:14:34 Destroyed
01:14:36 You know that's so that's so weirdly wholesome. Yeah, it is. It is extremely wholesome. That is like
01:14:45 Yeah, that's like something mother goose would tell me
01:14:49 Something mother goose would say to the black people in the neighborhood. That's like a witty the poo-wism
01:14:54 Yes
01:14:55 Oh god mother goose
01:14:57 I don't know whether I've mentioned this before but I have nightmares of mother goose. What for what reason explain
01:15:03 Because when I was a baby, I had the mother goose thing and the the the packaging that it came in one thing
01:15:09 What thing is like some some brother's grim stuff that's like been repackaged for the waste or something now
01:15:15 I have no idea what it is. I just know that there's a goose and she wears a little a
01:15:20 Bloop on it. Yeah, and it's supposed to be for kids and there was this I guess plastic um
01:15:26 You know robot thing mother goose that would sing to you. I think mother goose is public domain character. Okay. Yeah, I'm tempted to say
01:15:35 So so there was this thing. I don't remember what the product was but I remember the packaging
01:15:40 Um, which was this big cardboard box with a mother goose on it and I always used to see
01:15:45 Mother goose staring at me on that packaging from the other end of the room
01:15:49 It was the only thing that had eyes in my room like when you were sleeping from your bed or something
01:15:53 Yeah, when I was sleeping I was like and then later we moved that up into the loft
01:15:59 Um, and it would be put right at the back and when I was like young and like the loft at the moment is like renovated
01:16:06 Since been renovated into an upstairs
01:16:09 Bedroom like it used to be uh, uh, uh, you know a horrible
01:16:14 A dark scary cold uninsulated
01:16:17 mess of a broken childish
01:16:20 Broken children's toys and like old photographs and demons and spiders
01:16:25 And so occasionally I would go up there and like there would be mother goose staring at me in the exact same way
01:16:31 On on that box all the way in the end in the darkest darkest bit
01:16:37 And she would eat me and I would be scared that she would fucking bite her goose
01:16:41 Fangs on me. Geese are very aggressive. They are. She's that's true. She's open domain
01:16:47 So welcome new mainstay pcp character mother goose haunting gib in his dreams and nightmares
01:16:53 Welcome to the family mother goose
01:16:55 Glad to have you you're equally important to the dude. We gotta make a mother. We gotta make a mother goose shirt
01:17:01 Immediately, please make a mother goose harassing gib shirt everybody. You will see mother goose below this video
01:17:08 When you watch it, I want to see you know what I want. You know that um that american gothic
01:17:12 I want one of mother goose is like the masculine like farmer and like the terrified woman to his left
01:17:19 Is gib just being intimidated. Is she terrified? Is that how you read american gothic? No, but i'm reinterpreting it for this particular
01:17:26 I'm like the weirdly hyper realistic goose face, uh of the american gothic. I think would really work
01:17:31 I think would really work
01:17:33 So please draw that for free ladies and gentlemen, uh and send it to me put some hyper realistic blood on it like my creepypastas
01:17:40 Hyper realistic blood
01:17:42 Yeah, you know, you're playing you're playing a haunted video game. You're playing a haunted pokemon cartridge
01:17:48 You're playing a haunted painting. Yeah, and then you get you get stabbed and and your pokemon die
01:17:53 But there's hyper realistic you get that blood dot png just right on the screen there
01:17:58 It's just from google.com with watermark. There's nothing more realistic
01:18:02 It would be so it would be so much more scary if it was pixel art animated blood because then it would be like wait
01:18:09 Did they program this in there or is it real? Oh my god?
01:18:11 Do they believe the actual pixel mons to get this pixel blood that's fucked up? It's not it's not scary unless it's a ghost
01:18:19 It's not scary unless it's a ghost with that on this shirt. It's not scary unless it's a ghost
01:18:25 God i'm just i'm just full of brilliant ideas. God. I'm this could all be shirts
01:18:30 Uh, okay. Speaking of gold mine. Yeah. Yeah, do I marry emily abigale or lia? Jesus christ
01:18:40 I'm gonna say lia. I'm
01:18:42 I'm gonna say
01:18:43 Emily because I like that name the most is from stardew valley by the way people no go for lia lia is obviously the
01:18:49 The diamond in the rough waifu that you're supposed to go. Emily. Emily was my first pick
01:18:53 Yeah, I mean immediately. I was I honed it on emily, but then I'm like a little bit
01:18:58 I don't know and now i'm like wavering back and forth between abigale. Well, it's uh, do you want to?
01:19:03 What's what's the word when women marry up? Uh poly no, it's uh, you know what i'm talking about hypergamy
01:19:09 Hypergamy, yeah
01:19:11 Like because if you marry lia, you're getting nothing you're not getting a single sheep for your dowry. You're getting
01:19:15 What am I getting from abigale?
01:19:17 Uh, abigale has like a she lives with her family, right? So they can supply a dowry of of pierre pierre doesn't have the kind of
01:19:25 Money to throw around he's he's always struggling. He's got some gems. I don't know. Let me her throw up
01:19:31 She's she's uh, she's spike. She's a dragon
01:19:35 Um guys, uh, could that be please a a my little pony risk in of stardew valley where I could choose to marry fluttershy
01:19:42 That'll be good. Thanks. I don't know. That would definitely. I don't know why there isn't one already
01:19:47 In fact, I wouldn't be surprised. Well, you can already ride a horse. You could just roleplay as that horse
01:19:51 Um
01:19:53 Dude, I put a hat on my horse. It was fucking sick. You get hats for your horse
01:19:57 You can put any hat on your horse. I had no idea
01:20:00 Yeah, welcome to hats for your horse
01:20:06 Slimefield slime felt has never looked better horses for your hats like a little horse that goes like runs on the inside of the
01:20:12 Brim. Yeah. Oh, they'll be sick. They'll be sick
01:20:16 Um, you feed him tiny tiny carrots. I only know two things in this world. That's hats and horses
01:20:21 You're voting you're voting leonate. Yeah, mostly because emily's mine. So stay away from her. Are you fucking? I?
01:20:28 I've been leaning more towards leon abigale. I don't know. There you go. There you go. Abigale's trash to pick her
01:20:35 I think
01:20:37 Ah god, so difficult. I think
01:20:40 I think leah is probably the most like she's the obvious choice. I think she's she's the one who
01:20:46 Okay, I like leah because it seems like she probably
01:20:49 Isn't like an idiot like abigale seems like kind of an idiot and like it's kind of cute
01:20:56 Wait a minute. I just found
01:20:59 A sexy picture of abigale. Now. She's the top contender. She looks way less fat than she does in her portrait here
01:21:05 But I kind of hate
01:21:07 Leah's taste in food. She's got basic bitch taste in food. She's because she's poor as shit
01:21:12 She can't afford the gourmet stuff. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. She likes wine. She likes truffles
01:21:17 She likes goat cheese. She is totally human core and it's disgusting
01:21:22 Oh
01:21:22 Abagail is nothing but heel and monster zero
01:21:25 Abigale is practical leah is practical and abigale is kind of like like what the fuck is she thinking?
01:21:31 What is she doing with her life? She's all so random, but she's not no emily's random. Yeah, I guess you're right
01:21:37 She's the pinky pie of but abigale is post food. Well, no, she likes to eat but at least she's less human
01:21:43 Oh, yeah, she sure does. Oh, I'd love to eat. Oh, I'm gonna be stuffed more food in my face
01:21:49 I found a I found a secret note from her that says like here's some things
01:21:53 Here's some of my favorite foods. I love to eat and I'm like
01:21:58 Fat confirmed fat confirmed
01:22:01 But even more damningly human core confirmed and that's
01:22:05 That's the worst of all leah is the most human core and it's damning. It's the one thing against her
01:22:11 All right, uh, should we move on to the voicemails? I think it's about how long we've been going an hour and 22 minutes
01:22:16 Pretty good. I guess I guess wait, um, no

01:23:23 Goodbye slime fields. You were a good hound. I uh, I know there is a voicemail that's about the pizza party
01:23:30 I forget it's the first or the second one. So we'll just have to dive in and we'll we'll get to it

01:23:44 This first one is from dining kroger
01:23:48 Dining kroger, uh go
01:23:50 I met an interesting guy in a brew pub the other day and I actually engaged in a long conversation with him
01:23:57 First we talked about anime and I thought he must be an anime reviewer of some sort
01:24:01 Then we talked about video games and I was certain he was a game designer
01:24:05 Lastly we talked about memes and I was sure he was a four-changer just like myself
01:24:09 Well, the hour grew late and the next day I inquired about this man the waitress
01:24:13 I'm describing his unkempt appearance and she stops me and says don't you know that was the pcp
01:24:20 Had no idea
01:24:22 Wait, what that I guess this entity was the pcp
01:24:27 I thought this was like a joke. I I thought this is I thought this is gonna be to laugh
01:24:32 Like you know, I thought this was like a uh, a um, you know a four-channer a game designer and an anime reviewer walk into a bar
01:24:40 And it's the pcp and that's and yeah
01:24:43 That's the end no one laughs. Um, I'd like to apologize for selecting this just like the real podcast
01:24:48 Oh, no, everyone started everyone started laughing until they all bowed their heads in shame and walked down
01:24:52 Um, although his name was dining kruger, which I'm wondering is a pun on dunning kruger
01:24:58 You know, maybe it it sounds like could there be a joke here. Could there be a joke?
01:25:04 Um, we'll never know. I think it's probably just his handle

01:32:42 Let me see gigadonk mcfronk calling back. I think let's uh, cool. Let's let's let's go
01:32:48 Hey guys, sorry if my voice sounds a little gay. I've been listening to the procrastinator's podcast recently
01:32:54 I just wanted to follow up on my previous voicemail where everyone took it at face value that I was actually asking you for
01:33:00 romantic advice at age 21
01:33:03 Uh, I'm not really a fucking turbo virgin who lives in his basement and thinks that he needs to date someone who
01:33:11 Likes video games to be cool. Okay. Uh, I know I know it sounds like uh, I was just pretending to be retarded kind of scenario
01:33:19 But no legit. I was no cool. I didn't mean it. Uh, the girl broke up with me anyway
01:33:24 So uh, while I'm here if you guys don't mind, I'd like to seek out
01:33:28 A sexual fulfillment by giving each of you a kiss full on the lips one by one then saint
01:33:35 You're up first. Come here
01:33:38 Oh
01:33:40 Yeah
01:33:46 I have aids
01:33:49 Sorry bro. Well
01:33:50 That's it. You could have told him you had time
01:33:53 Why didn't he kiss the rest of you and get you all and get you all some of that distracted by his recent diagnosis of aids
01:33:59 So, you know, I suppose he'll come back to us. That's no reason. That's no reason
01:34:02 We all know that aids is like a sudden shock that runs through your body. You know instantly that you have it
01:34:07 I've always been a bug chaser. This is my one chance to get those sweet aids, but maybe next time
01:34:12 Maybe next time. Well, you just got a kiss bent on the lips
01:34:14 Um, I mean we are married now. Oh, yeah, you know, that's true. Uh, but I've sworn a vow of celibacy
01:34:19 But anyway, we'll get you've done all the gay sex
01:34:21 But you you're gonna get around to the kissing on the lips part in the holding hands that comes last
01:34:27 Yeah, I guess one of these days. Okay next call. Here it is from zack
01:34:32 go
01:34:34 So last time you guys mentioned that nobody on the pcp actually does much procrastinating
01:34:38 Which brought to my attention that you gormless peons don't even grasp the true genius behind your own name
01:34:43 See when the unifying theme of the pcp is that every member has another creative outlet aside from the podcast
01:34:48 The act of recording the podcast itself is inherent procrastination from said creative outlets
01:34:54 But since the pcp is monetized, you are literally professionally procrastinating. You are pro
01:35:01 Crastinators
01:35:05 Yeah
01:35:07 Oh, I wish it had kept going. Yeah, but uh, that guy is on the money. Yeah. No, that's good
01:35:12 That guy that guy gets us better than we get ourselves update the wiki ladies and gentlemen. That's canon. That's confirmed
01:35:17 He's I already knew that like the professional part of procrastinators was that it was a thing we were getting paid for
01:35:25 Like the idea that that we are procrastinating on our own stuff
01:35:31 By doing the money thing. That's that's good. I am smart at this very moment
01:35:35 I am filled with anger and piss and bile and shit and come at the fact that I can't be working
01:35:41 On my weaguar right now and as soon as this is done. I'm getting back to it. So it's fair. The fabled we are going to be working
01:35:48 Right now. There you go. Instead. I'm recording this fucking podcast. Nobody likes it
01:35:54 It's really bad. It's really bad now
01:36:00 All right, we've learned we've learned a lot today. That was good. We've covered a lot of grounds. I appreciate that Zach
01:36:05 Thanks. Uh, okay next one's from f-frame. F-frame's got some frame. Mm-hmm. Oh
01:36:11 So I'm big into rfck. I hang out there a lot
01:36:16 And there are so many people there that I can safely call my friend at this point
01:36:21 In that got me thinking about the whole pcp friendship simulator meme
01:36:25 And I thought
01:36:27 Is pcp a friendship simulator at this point? Is it really just a simulator?
01:36:32 Because with me new moving to new areas for college
01:36:35 Um, I don't have many real life friends and I go to rfck and that's my social circle
01:36:42 And sure i'm not friends with digi or nate
01:36:44 But pcp the pcp has probably got had the biggest role in creating
01:36:50 my new social circle
01:36:52 And I just think that's funny. Um, little food for that. Well, that's nice. You know, I
01:36:58 Thanks for the call of frame. I know that guy. He was at the first. He was the first
01:37:02 He was at rf roddy fuckers con killers one. Um, so he did it. He turned it into real friends. Yeah, I guess so
01:37:08 He's not he's not all talk
01:37:10 Living the gimmick. I was I was thinking about this. I've been thinking about this recently how like
01:37:17 the
01:37:18 I mean I
01:37:20 How am I gonna say it like to to a certain extent? Yeah, like
01:37:24 You might you might think that like the point
01:37:27 Of a community, right? Like around the pcp community. Yeah that the point of it is the pc is the pcp
01:37:35 But maybe it's not or it doesn't have to be like the community itself and the people in it
01:37:41 Can be the the point. I don't know. Maybe that's obvious
01:37:45 Maybe that's really obvious, but I was just thinking about I was like, huh, you know
01:37:49 I mean people don't just people like people don't necessarily just I don't know
01:37:54 Pop into rfck for the game or for me or munchie or whatever. Yeah, they don't come to the pcp discord just to like, you know
01:38:02 See us or whatever or you know and so on with like anyone's community. That's true. They're they're they're they're
01:38:08 You know, it's the other people that are there that they're congregating. I mean really it's it's you know
01:38:13 A like-minded people like everybody likes this thing. So there's a lot to talk about that they know that they can talk about
01:38:19 Yeah, I guess the discord community and just you know, the communities that have spawned is a
01:38:24 Is more of a benefit than you might think at first. It seems like it's pointless and meaningless, but no, it's actually kind of good to have
01:38:31 Um, well, it's not I mean, it's not just discord, but yeah, for example for example
01:38:35 Discords and and you know, I guess we can as the members ourselves, uh, especially for me
01:38:40 I can be very like member oriented and not thinking about other people and so when I've said friendship simulator
01:38:46 It's it's like in goodwill hunting
01:38:49 Like the teacher guy whatever shawn says to will hunting like hey
01:38:53 Uh, who who like who's your buddy who inspires you and the guy's like, you know, uh, nichy lock and he looks Shakespeare, etc
01:38:59 And he's like, yeah, but they can't give back to you. They aren't your soulmates, you know
01:39:03 You can't have dialogue with them and I feel that applies to like the pcp members in the audience specifically
01:39:10 but
01:39:11 Beyond that though as as you know a frame and ben are saying the uh, yeah
01:39:15 The community absolutely you can't touch and frankly guys like ben and munchie get pretty deeply involved with their communities as well
01:39:22 Anyway, and meet a ton of them. So it's not even that much of a distance some sometimes don't say that because I've really been well
01:39:28 Yeah, I've really I've really been neglecting rfck this last like
01:39:32 But I'll be back
01:39:34 With the people active in my discord. Oh, I recently launched gonna. We're gonna do anime nights on
01:39:40 Fridays and Saturdays and I'm gonna watch a happy funny comedy anime
01:39:45 You know that makes me want to plug. Do you want to plug your discord or something? Is it a patron discord or is it?
01:39:51 Okay
01:39:55 Maze elitist lethal aurora hates the common people
01:39:59 No, I mean you can
01:40:02 Get get through a patron just because I'm lazy to edit it out and I feel like you know, it's fine
01:40:06 but uh
01:40:08 It was open to the public at some point and a lot of people got in and they're still around and
01:40:13 There are ways to get in but like I don't want to open it publicly
01:40:17 I don't want too many people, you know mage that just reminds me of uh
01:40:21 I can be a real one-man show with a lot of stuff
01:40:23 I'm doing and I kind of hate involving other people in the work
01:40:26 I'm doing depending on what the project is
01:40:28 But like it reminds me of when I was in college and I was in an anime club that was full of giant spurg lords
01:40:34 But they weren't bad people and frankly just having people around who I could finally talk to about anime for like the first time in my life
01:40:41 Uh was real special and they introduced me to a lot of anime
01:40:45 I probably wouldn't have found like gurl a login and shit if it wasn't for that club
01:40:48 And oh, just it's just making me nostalgic. It was it was a pretty good time. It's a pretty good time
01:40:54 I used to be in an anime club too, but I don't remember much about it. How old were you when you were in it?
01:41:00 Uh, I was I was definitely a teenager in the older years, but uh, I like they were nice people
01:41:06 They weren't like spurgs or whatever you call them. Uh, I just but I use the term endearingly
01:41:13 Yeah, they were they were cool people
01:41:14 There were just a lot of them and I had a very hard time sort of talking speaking out
01:41:20 My mom was happy that was finally like going out and involving yourself with people, but just like
01:41:25 There wasn't like a tight connection with them. They were nice to me though. Like they they were really people
01:41:30 So nothing bad is just you know, sometimes people just don't connect
01:41:33 I did meet all my best friends at my anime club or my all my college best friends and uh, uh,
01:41:39 They only came for like one day though, and I'm the only one who stayed long term
01:41:43 But thank god they came for that one day because that's what I remember
01:41:45 I remember we watched this this one anime movie and I I don't remember the title
01:41:50 But it was I remember it was weirdly trippy and I can't describe it. It was like a dream, but it wasn't a dream
01:41:55 so don't worry, uh
01:41:57 It was it was it was it was so weird and I I wish I could find it again
01:42:02 Just so I could rewatch it with like fresh new eyes of like yeah. Yeah
01:42:07 I don't watch tokyo godfathers
01:42:09 Oh, I still want to watch that as well. Yeah, it's dope. It's totally dope
01:42:13 Oh, and I downloaded perfect blue gotta watch that sometime. Okay. Anyway, we got two more voicemails
01:42:17 Let's let's get to those next voicemail is from center point old fan favorite go

01:44:10 Women on vacation want to fuck end of conversation. This is your golden opportunity. You've probably already done it like every day of the week

01:45:12 I don't get it
01:45:13 I do maybe maybe I'd get it if I went there, but I don't think I would I think I like my rainy
01:45:19 I think I like my rainy urban fucking
01:45:22 Uh
01:45:23 Well, you know, you know, I mean don't they say they say that like you know seasonal depression is the thing, right?
01:45:28 Because like it's like it's cold outside. It's winter and stuff. You can't go outside
01:45:31 You gotta bundle up life's just kind of a hassle when you live in a cold and rainy place
01:45:35 In like a in a sunny tropical island. First of all, you can just go outside in nothing and feel perfect and feel great
01:45:42 Second of all the beach is like literally right there
01:45:45 And I've always loved the ocean and I miss it so desperately living in the middle of fucking nowhere out here
01:45:51 And uh, you know, I want to live there so bad
01:45:54 I want to live in either like LA near the beach or like destiny islands fucking texas by the beach destiny islands. Yeah
01:46:01 Yeah, why not? That's basically hawaii right there. Oh, I love the fucking ocean. I'm literally saura and I miss it
01:46:08 I I love the ocean too. That's great, but uh
01:46:11 Yeah, it's all right. I do like to take the ocean. I do like urban grime. Sure
01:46:17 But it's Stockholm syndrome. Hell yeah, it's Stockholm syndrome though because you know, the only
01:46:21 Yeah, the only brief windows in my life that I've ever even been anywhere close to approaching
01:46:26 Remotely in the vicinity of happiness. I've been on a beach somewhere and you know
01:46:33 Beach is a great
01:46:35 Same thing with that dreaded interrelationship status, you know, I like it, but it's Stockholm syndrome, you know
01:46:40 When I was really happy it was completely alone in the world
01:46:44 You know, I feel like the whole like beach thing like most people don't live on beaches
01:46:49 Yeah, except people in hawaii
01:46:51 um, but like
01:46:53 There's I think most of hawaii isn't on the beach, you know, it's it's it's just that it's no
01:46:57 But what what I'm getting at is like the beach isn't inherently way better than you know any other place
01:47:04 Um, but when you're on holiday, it's uh one
01:47:06 It's uh an escape from whatever bullshit you have to deal with back home and all the people that you have to deal with back home
01:47:12 I hear you all the people who give you shit were on the same beach. It wouldn't be very good anymore
01:47:18 You know, that's a great point. That's a great point. I don't I mean, I think if I lived on in hawaii or something
01:47:22 Or if I lived in it, I mean, I wouldn't swim in the ocean
01:47:26 All of the see I would just because I just because I lived I would if I lived like let's say a five minute walk from
01:47:32 Damn it. I'd probably be like a five or ten minute walk from the beach at least or maybe a drive
01:47:36 I feel like
01:47:37 I feel like I'd be there every day
01:47:39 I feel like I'd make time to go there every day if it was if it was a drive
01:47:43 I would go
01:47:44 Couple times a year if it was a walk. I would go maybe once a month
01:47:48 You know, because I've got to accept the fact that my lifestyle right now is very much inside on my computer
01:47:53 You know, I go get up and go to the gym when appropriate, but I'm not like thinking about like yay go do fun things
01:48:00 I'm a worker man. That's how I've
01:48:02 Configured my body and my brain
01:48:04 Uh, so like even if I lived straight up in like the best beach in the world
01:48:08 Would I take advantage of it or would it just go?
01:48:11 You know unused as I'm stressed out with work and stuff in the day-to-day grind
01:48:15 It's definitely possible. Definitely possible. It's yeah, it's possible. But like
01:48:20 I said that but like I do like the idea. I think it's just
01:48:24 you have to
01:48:25 To understand that going somewhere forever is a lot different than going somewhere pretty often
01:48:31 That's very living in hawaii is a lot more different from going to hawaii every year for a whole the good news is
01:48:37 That michelle did live in hawaii. And so I got her stories now to be fair
01:48:40 She lived with her parents and didn't have a ton of responsibilities
01:48:43 So, you know, that's different from like my life where I have to do lots of work all the time and stuff
01:48:48 um get a job michelle, but uh
01:48:52 um
01:48:53 You know
01:48:54 That's it. Like I just frankly I watched point break. Okay. I watched point break again recently
01:48:59 It's a movie about surfing. I want to be a surfer so fucking bad. I want to be on the beach
01:49:05 I want to hit the waves. I want to those guys are so tanned and beautiful and fit
01:49:10 I could be that if I was just by a beach right now with the board
01:49:15 Get me there remember that that episode of pokemon where they have to ride the big wave to hit the the rock with the flag
01:49:22 I think I do remember that actually is that like season one. Is that squirtle like surfing or something?
01:49:28 No, it's just there was this old man who was just like
01:49:31 Uh, I I used to be able to ride the wave to put the flag at the top
01:49:35 And now I I I failed and I can't do it rings a very vague bell
01:49:41 I feel the same and then the episode straight after was in the same location
01:49:44 But it was a ghostly house on the cliff. Don't you love when they do that? They do stuff like like they're in the
01:49:49 Building an environment is a really satisfying thing and having like even a like a pokemon show where like they're journeying around
01:49:56 To have a couple of episodes like in the same town doing like different things within the town
01:50:01 Pretty good feel pretty good feel mr. Mime, pidgey, Bulbasaur, Nidoran
01:50:06 Jinx, Sonic's
01:50:08 God, I am a night slope everybody. Here's your homework. You have to go watch point break
01:50:13 The first one not the remake the remake is good, but the original is way better
01:50:18 God I long for the beach. I long for the sand
01:50:22 I wait, what's what's the moana song? I'm a girl who loves her island. Okay, that's
01:50:28 That's all I got how
01:50:30 And can I be?
01:50:34 Okay, we got one more voicemail last one last one last one rounding it out this one is from let me see
01:50:43 PCP israily shills
01:50:45 2019 so uh, they caught us sounds pretty good sounds pretty good. All right go go
01:50:51 Best guy ever
01:50:54 More like best goi ever got him crap endless jess
01:51:00 More like endless jihad
01:51:04 Oh
01:51:07 More like munchy wears tiny hijabs
01:51:12 That's a half of those things half of those things aren't even israeli. No, they're not. Yeah, no really not maybe
01:51:19 In fact a goi they were all they were all explicitly not. Yeah, all those things are wait a minute. Okay
01:51:25 Maybe this person is the pcp israeli shill 2019 of fame of the and he's mad at us for not being israeli
01:51:32 We're not we're we're not supporting the israeli state. Yeah
01:51:36 He's shilling for israel in this voicemail and try and he's like he works for like the uh the tourism department of israel
01:51:42 And he's trying to you know bait us
01:51:44 Into coming to israel. Well, damn. I mean, I guess we better do contact our jewish overlords and make sure we're pleasing them properly
01:51:52 Could this be my beach vacation of my dreams?
01:51:57 It could be they do have uh, easton client from h3h3. Yeah
01:52:02 Isn't it, you know
01:52:03 Not to get too serious or anything, but isn't it just what an what an absolute beach of a man
01:52:07 That's true. They just straight up pay you if you're jewish to come to israel or they'll like pay for the trip
01:52:12 That's a fucking deal. What a deal the human sandbar
01:52:19 That's fair. That's accurate
01:52:20 Is he still shit is the consensus that he's still shit and gay?
01:52:24 You know online or is he been ready yet? I I thought they were both always shit. So I don't know why everyone
01:52:29 I saw a left-wing commie
01:52:33 Yeah hero
01:52:35 Respond to ethan
01:52:37 And I don't know what the controversy is but apparently there was a controversy being responded to
01:52:43 And this guy was like this guy was basically
01:52:46 imploring ethan like ethan
01:52:49 You know your fans are mad because you said the wrong thing and you have failed as what they perceived
01:52:56 You were as their quote-unquote thought leader. You need to not
01:53:01 Do you need you need to stop pandering to these people that hate you now?
01:53:07 Because they do not you know, they're in it for what the some weird political stance. They thought you represented
01:53:13 You need to get back to your lefty roots
01:53:16 You need to you need to be you need to be true to yourself
01:53:18 You'll lose some of your fans, but those are the fans. You don't want to have and da-da-da-da, and I was like god
01:53:24 I hate capitalism. Yeah
01:53:27 Yeah
01:53:28 You know, you know what that's the story
01:53:30 I forget if I talked about this go on jesse go on go on
01:53:33 It seems like from what I've seen of like the backlash or people turning from h3h3
01:53:39 It all stems from like
01:53:40 When they started doing their podcast and filming it and people saw that like they have absolutely no charisma in real life
01:53:48 but like
01:53:49 Wasn't that always
01:53:51 Obvious from their videos like why are people surprised?
01:53:54 I thought I thought the whole gimmick of ethan was that he was a weird gumpy guy with no charisma
01:53:58 I think I think the format social skills being edited. I think is a much better
01:54:02 Like he's able to be funnier and you know do takes over and do stuff. I think that works better for him
01:54:07 They associate the the funny meme edit with his
01:54:11 Ability to make the joke even though that's what you get for following anyone who uses jump cuts ever. Yeah
01:54:17 Yeah, stay tuned for this week's we Agua everybody jump cut central. Here we come, baby
01:54:22 um
01:54:23 Shit I was gonna say something. No, whatever. I don't know
01:54:26 happy pokemon day
01:54:29 of
01:54:30 thing
01:54:32 Business. Yeah off of just looking at videos and going what I mean
01:54:37 Yeah, and then and that that's it when he's in on a podcast
01:54:41 He's just he's got a lot less to say which is why it's all guests
01:54:45 That I mean, that's fair. You know, you got to spice it up. It's yeah
01:54:48 I mean his whole lawyer has been reacting to like other people's shit. Indeed. That's how he got
01:54:53 I don't hate him which I have no respect for in the first place. Yeah fair enough. Um, hey
01:54:59 Yeah, yeah go on
01:55:00 Nothing, just fuck them. I don't like them. Okay. I I don't hate him. I don't know. I haven't tuned in to where's the podcast
01:55:06 Ethan I don't hate him, but I don't like him
01:55:09 No, no, we can't dilute that. Okay, you're right. That is a pizza party podcast meme
01:55:15 That's the only podcast that I can't find all right. I I found all the other podcasts
01:55:19 That's the last one that I haven't added to my collection
01:55:22 But but the the h3 podcast. I don't know when it's when it is so like when's the podcast
01:55:28 That's that's the meme for them good
01:55:30 Hey, uh, Ben, I just wanted to respond to your thing about hating capitalism. Okay, serious point, but I'm not going to get that into it
01:55:36 It's just that I had a thought. Oh, let's fucking get I may have said this before
01:55:40 But I think I deduced what the issue is and and here it is. Okay. It's that I think
01:55:44 Capitalism has a very specific usage and that's like wealth generation and it seems pretty good at that
01:55:50 Like communism and like other stuff like that socialism, etc
01:55:53 Seems really good at like taking wealth that has been generated and trying to like, you know
01:55:58 Make society fair make everybody even and all that stuff and like those both make sense in different situations
01:56:05 It's just a matter of like what your priority is
01:56:07 Which which of those things you like better and I'm you know to me helping people helping people
01:56:12 That's some pussy shit. That's some pussy shit helping people
01:56:15 Fuck it. I mean make money
01:56:17 You know the way you said that is just sort of seems like the perfect solution is to
01:56:22 Just do both
01:56:24 Do both in like a in a in a rotation like you do kind of yeah to make gains and wealth
01:56:28 I mean, I followed up some of some communism to spread it out and then do a little bit a little bit
01:56:33 I mean, I mean capitalism is is a crime giving a shit about anyone is just an anchor
01:56:38 Human beings are just capitalism is ideal for generating personal wealth. That's well, okay
01:56:43 But I mean, it's totally true that the world has been improved by like the west's
01:56:47 Development of technology and you know, they talk about like the iphone has helped the world
01:56:52 I would say and you know all the technology that's gone in. Well, I mean, yeah, those things did those things did happen under
01:56:59 Capitalism, but I don't think it's fair to deduce that they would not have they could not have happened without it
01:57:03 But but I I mean I 100% think that's fair to say because what what's how would they
01:57:08 They were generated by the profit motive of the people who were working for those companies trying to you know make better
01:57:14 It's not impossible, but like the the reason that works is because
01:57:18 uh each individual comes forward with their own idea and
01:57:23 In the communist society or like where there's less incentive for the people with the good ideas to come forward
01:57:29 Yeah, um
01:57:30 They would need to be recruited and that just takes a lot of time and a lot of manpower to like find the people who can make
01:57:36 Really good technology. Yeah, I I agree
01:57:38 So like it's just it's just faster to do it capitalist because like people are motivated by the their own
01:57:43 You know the things they can get for themselves
01:57:45 So they will do it and then everybody turns around like oh that guy's doing something cool. Yeah, I agree
01:57:50 Yeah, and I just don't get like but then everyone's poor except the guy who did but that's their problem
01:57:55 I don't get the argument that people give of like well, you know people can criticize capitalism
01:58:00 But it's the best we have and nothing else would work and without capitalism
01:58:05 You know any other system would just devolve into complete and total anarchy and violence and I'm like yeah and your point is
01:58:12 Like is that supposed to be is that supposed to scare me? Is that supposed to be bad?
01:58:15 Jesse I was I was just about to agree with you. I was so close
01:58:21 Uh, like what what what is what is everyone's like what what what is wrong with complete and total anarchy and violence
01:58:28 We haven't tried it in a long time. Maybe it's time to give it a try again
01:58:31 Okay, it's been like thousands and thousands of years since we've had a state of complete and total anarchy
01:58:36 Maybe it's time to give it another go
01:58:39 Maybe it'll work
01:58:40 We we have had a lot of practice with a post-apocalyptic media to get used to the idea of a fucked up world
01:58:47 Where you just have to fight and kill and bite people
01:58:50 So many things that are issues and problems would not be problems in life
01:58:56 If just one change one simple change make violence legal. That's it
01:59:01 That's all you have to do if violence in all forms was legalized. There would be no problems in life
01:59:06 Life would be a happy stroll through a field
01:59:09 You gotta move to new los angeles city my friends. Yeah, he's right. He's right. They're your people. They're waiting for you there
01:59:14 I mean, this is what I am come come join us in the slide. I warm more and more every day to anarcho capitalism
01:59:20 It just seems like it's a real good plan. Uh, I see I think if you ben if you mother fucker
01:59:27 Violate the non-aggression principle on me my privately contracted nuclear device will be headed to your domicile
01:59:35 At you know at the fastest speed that my slave soldiers can make it go, uh, you know indentured servants
01:59:43 I pay them is the appeal is Nate is the appeal tell me honestly
01:59:46 Is the appeal of capitalism that under capitalism under like under anarcho capitalism?
01:59:52 That you get to daydream that you could one day be
01:59:56 At the top. Is that the appeal? I feel like that's the appeal for a lot of people
02:00:00 I think that that there is definitely a strong appeal. Well, it's like protecting the quote unquote american dream
02:00:05 Which is to like make it yourself, uh, you don't have to like rely on other people to help you
02:00:10 And then also that you've acquired, you know a decent amount of wealth
02:00:13 I don't think most even I think it's possible. I could get rich
02:00:17 I think it's pretty unlikely for me
02:00:19 But I do think I could carve out a pretty decent middle-class survival for myself in my life. I don't need to be at the top
02:00:25 I'll be happy with that. I just want to be Han Solo shooting a guy under the table. That's all I want
02:00:29 I want all of us to be free to kill each other
02:00:32 I mean, I didn't
02:00:34 Because you know, it's fair to say if you if you really are into capitalism, you're definitely
02:00:38 De-prioritizing like like fairness because I straight up don't believe in free will and people are born different
02:00:44 And that's not fair. It's not fair that people just are born different
02:00:48 So it makes sense to just even the playing field so everyone has an equally good experience of life
02:00:52 But that is fair. But we but we don't have an equal experience of life because capitalism rewards those with capital
02:00:59 And people are born with differing amounts of capital based on the families. They're born
02:01:03 I couldn't agree more. But what's the solution?
02:01:06 The only way that anything is ever going to be fair. Don't let people inherit wealth
02:01:10 Obviously, don't let people be billionaires. Why would we why would we punish people who raise?
02:01:15 Who like work really hard and acquire money to pass on to their children so they will have an advantage
02:01:20 No, my my children are not inheriting my wealth. No matter what I will be buried with it
02:01:24 I I don't want I want my children to grow up poor
02:01:28 So they have a sense of values instilled in them or a sense of complete mental insanity and fucking mental illness instilled in them
02:01:33 One of the others said for that
02:01:35 Nate, how is it a how is it a punishment? How is it a punishment to mr. Smith?
02:01:41 That smith that mr. Smith jr. Doesn't get to well, I'll tell you how Ben
02:01:45 I think a lot of people uh, the reason why they are trying to amass wealth is so that specifically
02:01:51 They can kind of pass on their wealth to maybe it's about protecting their legacy and it's wrong and it's wrong
02:01:57 And it's literally the the the argument for you know
02:02:00 Passing on wealth depends on what you mean by wrong
02:02:02 If if my father was wealthy then it's my birthright to inherit that wealth
02:02:06 But then isn't it all of our birthright to be born free with the freedom of killing each other and beating each other up
02:02:13 And doing whatever we want
02:02:15 Nate, I don't understand how you can sit stand there and be like oh under cap capitalism is the best system because
02:02:21 Everyone has the saint everyone has a fair shot at making it at making it big
02:02:25 Yeah, and then turn around and be like yeah, but people should be able to inherit wealth from their parents
02:02:31 They didn't earn I'll tell you I'll tell you exactly how bad because one of the one of the big components here is just freedom
02:02:36 And if we're gonna say that it's people aren't allowed to do with their money what they want
02:02:41 Which includes giving it to their kids or helping them or whatever then I mean
02:02:45 That's a huge invasion of like their personal freedoms
02:02:49 And maybe you think it's best to just do away with it, but you know
02:02:52 I just think these two ideas are completely at all. I agree. There are conflicts for sure. Listen. Listen. Listen. Okay
02:02:59 Human beings need motivation to do a good job
02:03:02 My grandma told me like back in her day back in the world wars and back when communism was the thing in the thin air
02:03:08 A lot of people you know had to do a job because they were told to do a job
02:03:12 But like a lot of the jobs were done poorly and a lot of like let's say construction work and bricklaying stuff like that
02:03:18 Was sloppy and the nation suffered because no one wanted to do the job
02:03:23 And they would still got paid the same amount whether or not they did a good job or they just did the job
02:03:28 So I'm gonna jump with them in the end no motivation. No need to do a good job
02:03:34 So and everyone suffered for it for it. Yeah, that's you know, that reminds me of mine
02:03:40 I don't see how that's different when when when there's like life currently like that's how
02:03:45 Like how many how many people like do office workers now do like nobody fucking cares about their job. No one's motivated
02:03:52 People will hate their jobs. I mean most people will hate their jobs
02:03:59 But the thing is like there is still a sliver of a chance that like they'll get a raise
02:04:03 They'll be promoted. They'll do something better. They might they might get a different job at some point
02:04:08 Like maybe maybe it's a stepping stone in their career. There are options. There are possibilities
02:04:13 But when when when you're stuck in one job and no matter what you do
02:04:17 You're still gonna have the job in the end of the day because someone has to do the job
02:04:21 You're not motivated to do shit. So long as you're there and you're punching the hours
02:04:26 Is
02:04:27 There was the the bad guy that's life for most people listen the bad guy in the movie the musical
02:04:33 1776 who is the bad guy said this and he's a he's a conservative
02:04:37 You know like right wing guy and he is the bad guy
02:04:40 Nonetheless, I think his point gets to the heart of the matter here and he just says
02:04:44 Uh something like most people would rather die like whatever. He's he's lecturing john adams and why john adams is wrong
02:04:51 and what he says is um
02:04:53 Like most people would rather die
02:04:56 Uh fighting against like being
02:05:00 God damn it. I forget what the point is he said like people poor people don't want to they want to protect the possibility
02:05:06 Of becoming rich rather than face the reality of being poor or something like that and that like that's why they support like whatever
02:05:15 Property rights and stuff like that. Okay
02:05:17 Um, so so like what it talks about is people want hope and people want to feel
02:05:23 Autonomous and when you do something like you institute a top-down
02:05:26 System where you've like slotted everyone into a thing
02:05:29 I think goes to mages point of like it just makes people unhopeful and unmotivated and that's why it slows down
02:05:35 Productivity and that makes the whole world worse. It definitely does less to exacerbate
02:05:42 Disparities but at the cost of dragging the entire like gdp if you want to think of it that way down
02:05:47 And you know, it's just a question if you think that's better or worse
02:05:50 Uh, and what problem you're trying to solve at that time? I think I just think that you
02:05:55 I don't know about any of that
02:05:56 You shouldn't you shouldn't extol the virtues of freedom at all if your idea of freedom comes with any caveats whatsoever
02:06:04 Well, that's silly because no, it's all or nothing every
02:06:08 Either you're allowed to do everything or else you believe not real
02:06:12 You don't really believe in freedom if you believe that i'm not allowed to kill you and take all your money
02:06:16 I mean, you're correct. I don't believe that that should be allowed. So I don't believe in absolute freedom
02:06:25 Um, ah, you're all coddled by modern society. Yeah, we're gonna see it for the facade that it truly is
02:06:30 I'm the only fucking forward thinking
02:06:33 Like who will be motivated to do anything if you if you know that you're just gonna die around are you kidding?
02:06:38 Anarchy is nothing but motivation. You're motivated to survive by any means necessary
02:06:41 Someone has something that you need to live you kill that person and you can't fear though
02:06:46 Exactly. I'm gonna I do I live in constant fear anyways
02:06:48 Everybody is living in constant fear anyways fear of having their shit taken away by by people above them
02:06:53 You know, everybody is afraid of getting like uh, you know, like kicked out of their houses or losing their jobs
02:06:58 That's the same fear
02:06:59 Just why not take that fear that you have for the people above you and just make it fair so that you're afraid of everyone around you at all
02:07:05 times
02:07:06 We still have like, you know the trust in the system that like maybe if someone screws us over that there's still
02:07:12 A way of making it right but like there's not though
02:07:14 Do you know how expensive lawyers are to fight for what's right if somebody that's with you in the current system
02:07:19 If somebody breaks a law and like hurts you in some way and you try to seek legal help
02:07:23 You're fucked it costs thousands and thousands of dollars if you're poor
02:07:27 You have no rights as it is if you're poor you already live in anarchy
02:07:30 But with all the rules of fascism it's the worst of both worlds
02:07:33 So you might as well just make everything fair for everybody and destroy all law and destroy all order and have violence be legalized
02:07:39 Once and for all and fix the fucking world once and for all
02:07:42 I'm like 90 there with you. Jesse. I'm I'm pretty I'm almost there with you. There's okay. Well, let listen
02:07:48 I did not grow up poor, uh, but the the larger factor is I have had very very few
02:07:54 Interactions with the law period you can't go to the fucking cops if you're poor and someone commits a crime against you
02:07:59 If somebody fucks you over and you go to the cops you get fucking singled out and like profiled as a criminal somehow
02:08:04 I just don't know if that's true. You can't trust the law. It's absolutely true
02:08:09 That sounds it's all bad. It's all the whole system is poison. It needs to be fucking destroyed. That's the difference
02:08:15 I have not lost all faith in the system
02:08:18 And furthermore, I feel strongly that whatever challenges are placed before me by the world
02:08:24 I have the tools and resources to overcome them. I feel that that's how I feel day to day
02:08:29 So that's why I feel resources to overcome them because you were born into those tools and resources
02:08:34 I mean, I mean I've I've been stolen from I've had my house broken into and robbed and I've
02:08:39 And I've gone to the police before to help and the police didn't do fucking jack shit for me
02:08:42 The police have never done shit to help me anytime that I've been the victim of a crime
02:08:46 A lawyer has never done anything to help me anytime that I've been the victim of a crime without just
02:08:49 Siphoning my money and doing nothing doing jack shit in return
02:08:52 No one has ever helped me legally when I've been the victim of something
02:08:55 So why shouldn't I then also be allowed to go rob someone and get back what was taken for me myself?
02:08:59 Why shouldn't there just be no laws?
02:09:02 Since the laws only apply since justice only applies to people who can afford it or people in higher social strata
02:09:08 Why shouldn't it just did all be destroyed? I mean, what do you want the system ain't perfect? I agree
02:09:13 But I mean, it's been real shit for you. It's been pretty great for me. So who's right? Uh, I don't know
02:09:19 Jesus christ, uh, well, how about this? How about this?
02:09:24 Uh, no more billionaires
02:09:27 Ben, this is the number one fucking thing. I hate about all you fucking make make nobody poor
02:09:33 No more billionaires and nobody has to be poor. What's his name that's skull with the glasses on his face, you know, uh,
02:09:39 Sean, yeah, Sean. I bet you retweeted this you fat motherfucker
02:09:43 Uh, it says it says, uh, he he's imagine being a billionaire and never once thinking about using your money to help poor people
02:09:52 Oh my god, you're right. How could elon musk have like never thought about that?
02:09:57 I don't know. Maybe he's thinking about like first of all, that's not hard liquid assets
02:10:01 That's investment in the companies that are currently generating wealth and helping the world
02:10:06 So I I think if you're a billionaire and you're not doing something charitable or philanthropic, you're obviously
02:10:12 How about making the world better by converting gasoline cars into electric cars that's going to help the planet
02:10:18 So there you go. I'm not against elon musk as a person. We're not we're not talking about your corporate assets
02:10:23 We're talking about your personal wealth people have personally owned billions of dollars. Well, that's fucked up
02:10:29 What are they doing with whatever the fuck they want to do with it? That's what they're doing with it. Yeah, they earned it
02:10:34 Yeah, they did fucking earn it ben donald donald donald trump earned that all I hear
02:10:39 All I hear when I hear people doing this is I hear a bunch of fucking losers
02:10:42 Who can't make a buck and then they're crying about people who are better at using the system to generate wealth
02:10:48 That's what I hear and it's embarrassing and pathetic
02:10:51 But what what if you're in a system where the thing that you're good at is no longer viable?
02:10:55 Maybe the thing I'm good at is killing people and robbing them. Am I supposed to be singled out like that's not viable
02:11:00 That's my talent. Maybe I don't know. I haven't tried it yet. I'd like to see
02:11:05 Well, for many reasons we don't want to do that. I can't believe I cannot I can't believe
02:11:13 You think it's fair that people can have that. Okay, but please understand
02:11:16 I cannot believe that you guys think it's not fair. So we're at an impulse. I don't think it's not fair
02:11:22 I think it's I think it's totally fair that people should be able to have all the wealth in the world
02:11:26 I just also think I should be allowed to throw a mile to have in their corporate windows
02:11:29 Kill a bunch of people cut their heads off go up to the top floor kill them take their money
02:11:33 Take their gold plated toilet seat take their fucking wife and their fucking jewelry and just
02:11:37 Think about this and a big burlap sack with a dollar sign on it and a fucking hamburger mask and a and a striped
02:11:44 Chail suit and run off and fucking go into a cave in my hideout camp
02:11:47 Like the fucking red dead cowboys and start my own society, baby. Hell. Yeah
02:11:52 Okay, please respond to this however you want to what do you think it?
02:11:55 What do you think is the proportion of people who are currently fabulously rich?
02:11:59 What do you think the proportion of them is that we're born into wealth versus came from nothing?
02:12:04 What do you think I don't know. That's probably quite a few
02:12:07 I don't know probably the majority I would say you think it's probably pretty skewed
02:12:10 You think you think maybe there's a lot more people who are rich now who are born that way
02:12:14 But ben while your focus is on the injustice that some people were just born into these systems
02:12:20 My thought is no one's entitled to anything these children were not entitled to the wealth that they now have and the people who don't have it
02:12:26 They you know, they're not being there's nothing being taken from them that they should have
02:12:31 It's just that the the rich parents here
02:12:33 Choose what to do with their money in this case support their kids or give them their billions of trillions of whatever dollars
02:12:40 And that's their right. Yeah, which leads to a society that is inherently unfair
02:12:45 But well look tons of societies across the world are terribly unfair. America's pretty great. America's pretty good
02:12:51 What can I do about Saudi Arabia? I can't do anything about Saudi Arabia
02:12:55 What I can do is try to make the world around me a little bit better. I'm I'm I'm here
02:12:59 I'm pointing out a thing like this is unfair and you're like, yeah
02:13:04 What and and what do you want? What do you want? I I would like it to be less
02:13:09 I would like it to be less unfair. I agree. So how about they adopt the american model because it's pretty great
02:13:15 I'm put I'm taught. I'm pointing at america, Nate. I'm pointing at america that we live in
02:13:20 Your focus is the best country in the world. That's your biggest problem not like the terrible totalitarian nations
02:13:26 The best country in the world. That's correct. The best country in the world. No, no fucking no fucking subsidized health care
02:13:31 No universal health care best country in the world earn earn money pay for health care. It shouldn't be free
02:13:36 All this like how much does college cost in america too much? Don't go get a trade
02:13:41 Best country that's great. Shut up. Yeah, you're an idiot. You're going off on a
02:13:46 harshly defending america being the best country in the world when you don't actually
02:13:50 Like you're just it's not really about that
02:13:54 You're just angry at this. You know what? I really think I'm explaining my point. Am I?
02:13:59 I'm a little I'm a little angry. I mean, I think you're very wrong. I mean, I I have uh, I'm not I think you're very wrong
02:14:05 There you go. I'm not I'm not like the rest of you weak masses adopting other people's philosophies. I've created my own philosophy
02:14:13 That I call uh anarcho fascism
02:14:16 Where that doesn't make sense
02:14:18 Basically the the way I see it is that the only way that anything will ever be fair for all of us
02:14:23 The only way that human society will ever advance and prosper is if we decide once and for all as a species
02:14:29 Whether we want complete anarchy or complete fascism
02:14:32 One or the other because both of those systems are fair in their own way and everything in between is just a middle man
02:14:37 Is just a compromise a worthless half measure that isn't fair and is never I mean to be fair
02:14:42 You could just say that you know like
02:14:46 Every system of government that we've ever tried has been some worthless
02:14:50 You know half measure between fascism and anarchy and we just need to decide once and for all
02:14:54 Which one of those fair systems we want to adopt and when we do everything will be fine
02:14:59 Because when when you have anarchy you have perfect freedom and when you have fascism in theory if it's like you don't have
02:15:04 Perfect fascism and anarchism it like if you're talking about gun to your head
02:15:09 Well, Nate you want you want parents to be able to give their kids their wealth like that's you know
02:15:14 We don't want to regulate that so we should unregulate everything
02:15:17 Anarchy because it would be it would be unfair to it would be unfair to tell people what they can do with their money
02:15:22 That's correct. That's correct. Jess. You should you should focus on bringing about like um
02:15:28 Zombie apocalypse, then you'll have anarchy
02:15:31 Well, like I mean, yeah, I mean because like for example in in the judge dread universe one of judge dreads famous catch phrases
02:15:38 Uh is the the price of justice is freedom
02:15:41 Meaning that you know, we sacrifice a little freedom for a little bit of justice and that's how judge dread
02:15:46 Justifies the fascist state that he operates in which I think is a you know a logical justification
02:15:52 if not a totally perfectly sound one
02:15:54 but
02:15:55 The the basic just you know with anarchy you get freedom and with fascism in theory you get justice and comfort
02:16:01 So we have to decide once and for all whether we want all the comfort and all the justice or all the freedom
02:16:06 We just have to decide one or the other because both I mean, I just would be better than anything we have now
02:16:10 I think that forever people will just debate the nuances of trying to balance those two things and that's where I mean
02:16:15 This is all hypothetical
02:16:17 Obviously because no one is ever going to adopt my policies because the world is stupid and no one understands how correct I am
02:16:23 But you know, I'm just saying if people were smart then we would decide one way or the other
02:16:28 But we never will so it's all fucking it's all hypothetical and pointless. It's all worthless. Nothing matters
02:16:34 Fair enough
02:16:35 Fair enough, you know when in in Minecraft when I get my house griefed on a server and it feels unfair
02:16:42 They steal my stuff. They steal my diamond pick. That's true anarchy
02:16:46 And so I don't like that. Like, uh, I like to have a locked chest. I like to have a chest I can lock in a
02:16:53 But then it again, you know, sometimes it's fun to go into someone's house and steal their shit. So, you know, I guess I'm I'm
02:17:01 Uh, I'm I'm politically fluid
02:17:04 I I I I swish to and fro between all all of the things
02:17:09 I don't even necessarily think that you can just arrive on one political philosophy that will just work forever
02:17:15 Like I was saying before I think that like capitalism is good at wealth generation and things like like being more socialist is about
02:17:22 You know, like fairness if like you have to probably cycle between the two
02:17:26 I don't think there's even like a perfect thing you can do
02:17:29 It's just we give up more and more freedoms for the sake of supposed justice because we want to believe that if someone
02:17:34 Wrongs us or commits a crime against us that the system will sort them out and they will face justice
02:17:39 But so many times so often that completely fails us, especially people in lower social strata
02:17:44 That that sense of justice fails you completely and doesn't actually work
02:17:48 So if it doesn't actually work, we need to either make sure that it completely works by taking away all freedom
02:17:52 Or we need to just get rid of it all together by taking away all law
02:17:56 And and having people sort it for themselves letting people kill each other
02:17:59 It can work. It can work to an extent though, right? Like it can work some of the time. I think if it works
02:18:05 I think I think working to an extent isn't good enough. I think it has to either completely work or not be there at all
02:18:12 Yeah, I I feel like that's work for everyone or for people should be free
02:18:17 It's it's it's a ridiculous statement, but it is kind of true that we need like it would be the most fair
02:18:24 The only thing is at the moment why there's like always conflict about it is because
02:18:30 The anarchy is good for the people who have nothing the poor people. Oh, yeah
02:18:35 And the justice the justice is good for the people who have the money. Yeah, that's true
02:18:39 Anarchy is not anarchy is not good in anarchy. You'll just develop like the very least you'll develop stratified societies
02:18:45 In it like because people will just you know ally and then they'll be able to win
02:18:48 So they'll just do that anyway the way they do now
02:18:51 You'll you'll just you'll just have I mean you'll just have exactly what we have now
02:18:55 Which is you know people hoarding all the wealth and becoming like, you know forming
02:18:59 Protective societies around themselves and probing themselves up only worse because it'll be unregulated
02:19:05 I uh, I said something a while ago in another. I think it may have been a bonus episode, but I like um
02:19:11 the idea that
02:19:12 humans
02:19:13 As a species have just not evolved to the point where we can deal with the amount of connectivity
02:19:19 We have with one another like we're still pretty tribal and we stay we like to stay in a small amount of you know
02:19:26 Small amount of people we know and we would be happier and easy and better able to deal with life
02:19:32 If we are all in villages still
02:19:35 but because we're all connected
02:19:37 It's it's you know, we're always fighting because we're always exposed to every other type of person the internet must be destroyed
02:19:44 I definitely believe
02:19:46 That's 10 at one of my philosophy room for a glorious new age
02:19:50 Step one destroy the internet
02:19:52 They say for example and I agree with this that communism works really well for like five people
02:19:56 Because you know them and like you don't mind like helping them out like the people who like need help
02:20:01 It's like I don't give a fuck about just some dude across the world. Sorry. I don't know you dude
02:20:05 I don't want to give you my money if I knew that guy. I probably wouldn't mind
02:20:09 Um, that's just I I blame my human genetics for that. Um that I you know
02:20:14 We we either need to evolve to be like a strange
02:20:18 Insect hive mind where we're all okay with the amount of people
02:20:22 And we we all like work together inherently or we all need to turn into you know to
02:20:28 Post apocalyptic go in small tribes and small villages again and eat saber tooth uh slime tigers
02:20:35 I just want to set my position right now, which is just that I'm I am not a rich man, but I'm doing fine
02:20:41 I'm surviving and doing okay, but if I
02:20:44 Succeed at my quest in life and become more and more wealthy to the point of you know, like I'm doing very well
02:20:50 Um, and then the people come out and are like, oh now we want to take your money and give it to the people who really need it
02:20:56 I'm gonna be like listen. I earned this. I did this all on my own
02:20:59 I had many advantages growing up that other people didn't have absolutely true, but why should I
02:21:05 Give up what I've earned. Why because I didn't deserve it. I think it would that's fair
02:21:09 What what what what what about that part? What about that part about how you had advantages that other people didn't have?
02:21:14 Well, see there's what about you okay? Here's the thing free will doesn't exist
02:21:18 So it's a matter of what do we do to make the world the best place it can be
02:21:23 But we have to factor in that people need a motivation to do stuff
02:21:28 My motivation is I want to make myself financially real secure
02:21:33 So you so you deserve what you got because you had a head start over other people because
02:21:39 You wouldn't have done it
02:21:40 You wouldn't have done the word deserve is you should not use the word deserve
02:21:44 Deserve is the wrong word because I'm not talking about what anyone deserves. I'm talking about motivation
02:21:48 I'm talking about motivation to do things because if you just if you tell me now that Nate, uh, listen
02:21:53 We're gonna implement hardcore socialism in 10 years all the money you earned by that point
02:21:57 We're just gonna take it then I'll be like, oh great now. I know not to do that now
02:22:00 I know to just relax and play video games. Thank you for letting me know that I shouldn't do this
02:22:04 But if I get cheated well, I don't think you should make well, I don't think you should get nothing
02:22:08 I don't think you shouldn't make money from your hard work. I'm just looking at these
02:22:15 I mean you look at someone who's got 170 billion dollars and like that's wrong
02:22:21 Like yeah, you should you should you should be rewarded for your hard work and for your good ideas and ingenuity
02:22:27 And all and your skills and all this good shit, but like nobody should be rewarded that much. That's an accident
02:22:34 That's the system failing
02:22:36 um
02:22:37 I mean Jeff Bezos hit gold and he developed a system that was disproportionately better than what everybody else was doing
02:22:44 and
02:22:45 Yeah, and now he commands enough wealth to house like
02:22:49 Half the fucking pop homeless population of america. Ben. It's not like he's not stolen this wealth from anyone
02:22:55 He just generated it through sales. Yeah, he is not taking anything from anyone. These are willing transactions people are making
02:23:03 He what do you mean? He's not taking it from anyone. It's a zero-sum gain. He has it
02:23:08 That's not how wealth generation works ben
02:23:11 It is it is how wealth generation works as a matter of fact. Okay, so so what so ben you're telling there's only so
02:23:17 Why did the people choose to buy the products available on amazon?
02:23:20 Because they would just want to give their money to jeff bezos or maybe because he was providing value through the service
02:23:25 Maybe that was part of it
02:23:27 You think jeff bezos is like do you do you think he's there like in amazon headquarters?
02:23:32 Like making all these sales and no he built like a system that he deserves to profit off of
02:23:38 No, he doesn't deserve to profit that much. Nobody. Well, I I'm with both of you
02:23:43 I think you're both right and I don't think that you're really that your ideas really contradict each other as much as you think
02:23:49 Because I think
02:23:50 Like you can have a system of capitalism that
02:23:53 Creates itself naturally without being backed up by stupid laws and regulations and bullshit. Like that's my main problem
02:23:59 Like here's my reason number
02:24:02 1517 million why the system has failed and must be destroyed every year
02:24:07 I have to sit down and do my stupid taxes and I have to you know, give the government money
02:24:12 Taxes and amongst people do your taxes. Don't forget. Yeah, and like but like it's complicated and it's annoying
02:24:18 It's a fucking process that I have to go through like fucking homework that the government gives me and if I do it wrong
02:24:24 If I make a mistake they can audit me and destroy my entire life. Why is that fair?
02:24:28 I think like I'm totally fine with the government saying we have the guns. We're going to steal your money every year
02:24:34 That's fine. I understand that I respect that but the fact that I have to do fucking homework and do this complicated
02:24:40 Bullshit and pay a service like turbo tax, you know, like like if I had the money
02:24:44 I wouldn't have to think about it because I could pay someone to do my taxes for me completely
02:24:48 And that's like another reason why like if you just have money then the system works for you
02:24:51 And if you don't have money then you have to do all the annoying fucking grunt work bullshit and homework that they give you
02:24:56 I would be fine with capitalism if it was natural and made sense if if you have the will to make a billion dollars
02:25:02 Whether by hook or by crook
02:25:04 Even if you have if you just hire a bunch of guys with guns and take over a small village and take everybody's money
02:25:09 I respect that that's fine. You could be a warlord for all I care
02:25:12 That's fine. You can come and take my money
02:25:13 But if you want to take my taxes every year then have it be like fucking disney's robin hood
02:25:18 Where the fucking cop comes knocks on my door and takes my coins in a coin purse and that's fine with me
02:25:23 Don't make me sit here at my computer and do this stupid fucking homework every year because it's fucking annoying
02:25:29 I I want to say I just want to say I have a consolation but go ahead. I'll say what if what if jeff bezos
02:25:36 We're only allowed to keep we're only allowed to have a hundred million dollars from his amazon mp
02:25:42 From his you know from his his master mining behind the servers that lots of people use and benefit benefit from
02:25:48 What if he were only allowed to have more money than any person could ever possibly need?
02:25:54 What a tragedy that would be. Well, listen
02:25:56 So you you have to acknowledge that you are taking the money that he otherwise would have gotten and so what do you call that?
02:26:02 Is that just distribution? I would call it theft
02:26:05 Uh, but you know, I'm totally fine with capitalism
02:26:08 It's just all the bullshit that comes with it the regulations and laws that I think need to be destroyed
02:26:12 It's just decided that I hate and people that I hate
02:26:14 It's it's theft if it's illegal. So you just make it legal. I hear you and you know what ben
02:26:18 I will give you my grand conciliation on this point
02:26:21 Just as I think it's fair and I think people
02:26:24 Must admit that the the people have inherent
02:26:28 Generally selfish motivations because we're built that way you have to bake that into your system
02:26:33 Which is why I think something like communism like mage was talking about
02:26:35 I just don't think it's gonna work for like
02:26:38 Compelling people like do stuff. You're just just as but as a person who is not rich
02:26:43 Well, I don't understand how you can have empathy or go to bat for people that have
02:26:49 A hundred or a thousand or a million times as much wealth as you do. Why are you?
02:26:53 Why do you want to defend because ben? I have principles. That's why like
02:26:58 Oh, that's right. If you're I don't I don't I don't if your stance is if your stance is capital
02:27:03 Slimes don't bother me be the richer for what it has nothing to do with me. I don't know
02:27:10 I mean, if you can prove that Jeff Bezos is using his money to like ruin the world or you know influence elections
02:27:15 It doesn't matter how he's using it. He doesn't deserve to have that
02:27:19 The word deserve is so loaded with like
02:27:22 Assumptions about you know the way the world shouldn't shouldn't be and I mean, I just don't agree here on wealth
02:27:28 Then we wouldn't have Batman. I mean, he's obviously using his money for good. That's fair
02:27:32 You know what? Let me let me just say this on this point. Okay on this point
02:27:37 Just as I have to I have to accept I think other people should that human beings
02:27:43 Need the proper motivation generally selfish to work and create and do things
02:27:47 I must also even though I don't want to I must accept that
02:27:51 tiny
02:27:52 P-brained
02:27:53 Baby unprincipled individuals like ben will just get mad and rise up
02:27:59 When they see people with too much wealth, that is a fact
02:28:02 You can't have things too out of balance or people will just get mad
02:28:07 Unfairly they will get mad
02:28:09 That's the natural order people who have the will collect all the wealth and hoard it until the people at the bottom get fed up
02:28:13 With it and rise up that seems to be the case. Yeah, but the but the problem with the current system
02:28:17 Is that the regulations and the technology and all the fucking surveillance and shit that we have
02:28:21 Is making it harder and harder for the lower class to rise up so that's destroying the natural order
02:28:25 Which is anarchy and violence when necessary
02:28:29 Capitalism only works in anarchy
02:28:32 Nape capitalism, baby. We fucking we outlaw monopolies. We bust trusts. We don't allow like corporate collusion
02:28:38 We like we we don't allow
02:28:41 Power to accumulate in that way. How is any of that any good?
02:28:45 Are you are you saying we shouldn't outlaw monopolies because I don't see a difference in principle between saying between saying
02:28:52 What wait no no no between what's what's the difference in principle between saying one company can't own an entire industry
02:28:58 Versus saying one person can't own like lots of money absurd. Well, I'll tell you Ben. That's very simple
02:29:04 Because you yourself I mean we all acknowledge the roles that monopolies have on the market
02:29:09 It makes a real difference, but you yourself said it doesn't matter how jeff bezos uses his money
02:29:15 Therefore influences the market you said all that matters is that he has
02:29:19 It doesn't matter and it doesn't matter in the sense that him having it is immoral no matter what he does with it
02:29:24 Well, I mean well fine then i'll just finish the point. It's that it matters how like if he does something bad with his acquired wealth
02:29:32 That's bad and we should stop that if he does nothing bad
02:29:35 Then there is no problem. So detect a problem. Well, you're wrong. I think I think it is a problem that he is allowed to have that much
02:29:42 There's nothing you've made no I just think it's self-evident. It's that that's your problem right there. That's your problem
02:29:47 I've been making a case this entire time. You have made no case that just having money is a problem
02:29:52 You've just asserted that you you've made well
02:29:54 I could just as easily say you've made no case that people being allowed to have all the money
02:29:58 They can they can they can my position does not impose on anyone there for I have no burden of proof
02:30:03 You have to show why is your your position imposes on society as a whole
02:30:07 You allow this incredible wealth disparity. You have to fucking prove it. Fuck you. I think you're wrong. I have to prove
02:30:13 I have to prove and you're saying something is a problem. I make no assumptions
02:30:17 I just say it's fine as it is. Don't worry about it
02:30:18 That doesn't that doesn't mean anything the fact you're you're saying something's good and I'm saying
02:30:22 No, I'm not. I'm saying it's neutral. I'm saying don't interfere with it. That's my point. That's
02:30:29 That's not what I'm saying. That's not a defense. I have to personally think that it's working well
02:30:33 That doesn't the fact that you're defending the status quo doesn't exempt you for making a case for it
02:30:39 I mean
02:30:41 What is exactly?
02:30:43 Where'd everyone go? Am I alone there? No. No. No. Okay. I feel like everyone cut out for a second sounded like it
02:30:49 Like what is exactly the status quo because capitalists?
02:30:53 I guess that's your stance Nate as a capitalist. I mean capitalists
02:30:57 like
02:30:57 Will rat will rally against the idea of socialism
02:31:02 But isn't that already? Well, are we already socialist if we're paying taxes? Yes, that's correct. Yeah, and so you're obviously right
02:31:09 Is the point the point it's about the balance and I you know we can all get carried away here
02:31:13 And as I was saying before I've tried to make it clear that I don't even think that socialist type programs are all bad
02:31:19 Or all need to go away and we need to swing like either 100 socialist capitalists
02:31:23 We should be 100 capitalist that doesn't make sense because there's going to be problems and it's going to cause issues
02:31:29 So I guess I just you know when I see someone saying that we need to be you know way on the other side
02:31:34 Maybe a hundred percent or maybe less. I think well hang on. I don't think that will work
02:31:38 I think I see issues with the way that'll be and I can point out my specific problems
02:31:42 Like you know I have with Ben here
02:31:44 So, you know, I guess that's my point. I just don't want to have to do any more fucking homework
02:31:49 That's my point. I guess well, I don't think I don't think we should uh, I don't think we should just
02:31:55 Level the playing field and say everyone everyone
02:31:58 No, no no ownership no private ownership
02:32:01 Everyone gets a fucking
02:32:02 Everyone gets their their canteen of victory gin and victory cigarettes rations and that's and that's and that's what you own
02:32:09 I mean, uh, but I think we should definitely be more socialist than we currently are. How about you?
02:32:14 How about universal health care? How about some fucking?
02:32:18 better fucking
02:32:21 subsidized
02:32:22 public education
02:32:23 Sounds pretty sounds pretty cool. My opinion. It's to me
02:32:27 It looks like the fact that the government is involved with both of those industries
02:32:31 It's what's drive what's driven prices up so high that they've become unsustainable and sort like that's right
02:32:38 That's ridiculous. Why the college school school doesn't cost what it costs in america in europe
02:32:43 Exactly the problem with the school price in america
02:32:45 The reason that it's gone up so much is because of the dedicated confirmed federal student loans that every student can get
02:32:51 So every college knows there was a huge cash of money guaranteed by the government
02:32:55 They can then afford to raise excuse me raise their prices and the government will subsidize it
02:33:00 That's what allowed the prices to spike so much since like the 70s
02:33:04 That's been the source of the problem the government intervention. Uh, I mean, that's what I've deducted anyway
02:33:09 I think that's correct. I don't know about how and they don't have that in europe, which is why it's not a problem
02:33:16 But we we do get loans. Well, so like
02:33:19 I mean, it's about the degree I would I would argue
02:33:22 I don't really know about it in europe
02:33:23 But like so so you could say that the problem we could just quote and quote solve it by just paying for these loans
02:33:29 But the prices have already gone up when the real solution is to step backward and say
02:33:34 Whoa, it's these loans that inflated the prices so much that have caused the problem
02:33:38 And caused so much like administrative bloat in colleges across the us
02:33:41 I think the real solution is to step backward and say this doesn't make sense from the start
02:33:46 We should, you know, find a better solution that doesn't cause these kind of effects on the market. Well, well, well, here's a solution
02:33:53 Don't give loans. Just pay people to go to college
02:33:56 Well, we've got to deal with the fact that prices currently have been massively spiked
02:34:00 I don't I don't know what to do about that. Somebody smarter than me needs to weigh in and like how to fix it short-term
02:34:05 My favorite pokemon is bulbasaur. Have we talked about that yet? Have we talked about
02:34:10 We did mention bulbasaur
02:34:12 My first my first mon my first love charmander. I picked charmander
02:34:17 You know the squirtle guy now the war toils my favorite pokemon or he's one of them
02:34:21 You know, I started out as a kid when I was in third grade when pokemon first became a thing
02:34:26 You know back back in the day my my guy was charmander. I was a big charmander boy
02:34:31 But as I grew as I matured
02:34:34 I uh, I slowly came around to being a bulbasaur boy
02:34:40 Yeah, and I think what what what ultimately changed me
02:34:44 Is even though I was a charmander boy at that time
02:34:46 They had the the jelly jars that had pokemon on them a little jelly and I had as a kid
02:34:53 A bulbasaur jelly jar and you know once the jelly is out you wash them they become glasses
02:34:57 So all my life did it what flavor what flavor jelly probably strawberry or fucking purple or whatever the fuck
02:35:05 Okay, I was hoping for something green. All right like mint jelly. Whoa. Whoa mint jelly. That's green
02:35:11 Uh, that sounds icky. That sounds like toothpaste basically. But anyways, I had the fucking it does sound gross doesn't you know
02:35:16 I had this I had this little glass that I would drink out of this little bulbasaur glass my whole life
02:35:21 Oh, you know and you know, I guess over time
02:35:24 Me drinking out of that bulbasaur glass every day in my life
02:35:27 It must have gotten into my brain and gotten it wormed its way down my spinal column into my fluids and into my heart
02:35:33 And uh, you know
02:35:35 That eventually I just said ah, fuck it. I guess I like bulbous or the best because I like my glass
02:35:39 If something happened to that glass
02:35:41 And with all the glass that breaks in my life all the glasses that tip over and shatter
02:35:44 If anything ever happened to that bulbasaur glass that would be it for me. I would be done. You'd never see me again
02:35:49 I'd kill myself. Mm-hmm
02:35:53 I like I like how I left for like a split second because the discord was fucking up and we went from whatever
02:35:58 We were talking about about bulbous or glass. I'm really happy. That makes me happy. Yeah
02:36:03 That's good. It's it's good to be back. And you know ben ben. I felt to be back
02:36:07 I did I did a cheap tactic there, which I shouldn't have done which is just
02:36:11 It was a little I said the thing when I said that I have principles what I should the the real answer there is
02:36:16 We have different ideological priorities. I think is the real
02:36:20 Issue there and I totally get and frankly we're different people. We definitely do. We definitely do and uh
02:36:27 I don't think uh
02:36:29 I don't think you're completely wrong about everything. You're wrong about everything. So there's
02:36:34 I think it's yeah, all right. Our priorities. I think I think we'd agree
02:36:38 Look if somebody laid out like true god-given facts on the matter
02:36:41 I think even just given who we are we'd probably just like maybe get different stuff out of them
02:36:47 Because that's what people seem to do
02:36:49 Um, I mean at some point it becomes hard to argue about these things because I mean, I don't know
02:36:54 I don't have like, you know, big fucking national brain
02:37:00 budget
02:37:03 I mean, there's a lot of there's there's a lot of data you could potentially consult
02:37:08 Yes, to uh to make these decisions and I you know, neither of us have it all in front of us. Maybe I've been straight out like
02:37:14 Oh, yeah, go on. Like oh, look, here's how here's here's what here's what happened to college prices
02:37:20 You know, here's here's what the here's what's what's going on with that
02:37:23 That's just what I've heard from seemingly reliable sources, but I have no data. So, you know
02:37:27 Yeah, I don't I don't know. I don't know why they're
02:37:31 We I mean, it's yeah. Anyway, I mean, I guess that's it. So see people we can we can end this on congenial terms
02:37:38 Obviously, I mean, I guess if we were like politicians and like needed to like make hard decisions on like how to operate the world
02:37:45 I like I guess what I would do is I would like commission studies and try to get like real data that would actually tell me
02:37:52 What would work best because I just want to know that. Yeah, you know
02:37:55 You know, it seems it seems like a fool's errand though to like like so much
02:38:01 There's so many people so many bits of data to collect
02:38:05 you would never really know
02:38:07 That much about anything ever. I mean people are collecting data
02:38:11 Uh, you know, I mean a lot of a lot of a lot of the people a lot of the people collecting data are doing it with an agenda
02:38:19 Um, and you got to watch out for that
02:38:21 For sure on both sides on every side
02:38:26 Um, and it's really hard to fucking navigate the maze of uh information and misinformation
02:38:34 That is our modern
02:38:36 And it's so easy to have confirmation bias
02:38:39 Uh, when you just go looking for stuff like, you know, I log into the pcp
02:38:42 I see ben watching all these lefty tuber guys and I want to throw up a little bit
02:38:46 I want to puke but I was I was on a real lefty kick
02:38:50 Uh, for a while a couple maybe like a maybe a month and a half ago or two
02:38:54 I was on it. Yeah fair enough. I just like, you know got real and just got real and got real into shawn for a bit
02:38:59 I tried to I I tried to play
02:39:02 I don't know if it worked. He's okay
02:39:04 Uh, what I was logged into the procrastiners account for like two weeks and all I did was click on like zit popping videos
02:39:14 In the hopes in the hopes that one of you would log on and have to see it too and you'd be like, eww
02:39:18 I'm always seeing
02:39:21 I'm always seeing Nate's weird asmr. There's just for that animal. Yeah
02:39:25 I log into pcp and I see Nate's weird asmr. You got charar
02:39:30 Lobster boy mob boss asmr. That's my dude. Yep
02:39:34 And I and then I log off. He's been on a real meat kick lately. He did like level one crook into level 100 boss asmr
02:39:42 Um, what the fuck?
02:39:44 It's a meme. It's the thing that was happening and like I mean year this was a year ago. I guess I I guess I know the meme
02:39:50 I guess I I I'm I mean you might be
02:39:53 But what the fuck does that sound but what the fuck does that sound like I mean
02:39:58 Question which I guess I could be answered if I went and I watched the video
02:40:01 But I don't know if I want to do more fame
02:40:03 He did pickle rick asmr where he dressed up as pickle rick and was featured on a beauty pies show
02:40:09 Um, because like what the fuck? Um, you know, so you know, he's getting around
02:40:16 That is epic. That is that he's been doing lots of memes. We can all we can all agree on that
02:40:20 Whenever I log on to the procrastinators channel, I try my best to never click on a video
02:40:25 So as to not because I don't want anyone to know. I you know, I feel yeah
02:40:29 I feel yeah, even though it's nothing even though it's like the things I watch aren't even that weird
