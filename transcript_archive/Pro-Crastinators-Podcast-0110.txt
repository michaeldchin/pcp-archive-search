00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Thank you for
00:00:15 cheering for me because I am the best guy ever and I deserve your applause and love. Joining
00:00:20 us today, we have The Davoo. Mmm, these cookies! I gotta get the recipe from Liz. We have Tom
00:00:28 Oliver. I'm hungry for a good episode. Damn. Meet up y'all. You're starving, you're starving
00:00:36 friend. I've been waiting since, I've been waiting a hundred and nine episodes and we
00:00:40 still haven't gotten one yet. But I believe, but I believe we can deliver. Hippocrit is
00:00:45 here. That's what sounds like when I'm hooking up some stuff. Ben Saint is here. Oh no, my blood
00:00:57 sugar. Get it, get it out. Get it out of me. Get the sugar out of my blood. No blood sugar
00:01:03 please. And we've got Munchy. Yo, I just cooked some eggs right before this podcast and I've
00:01:08 got one singular yolk here. All pristine and shit. I'm about to shove it into my fat,
00:01:13 gapy mouth. Let's go. I have one too. I'm gonna eat it. Oh, that's good. I just cooked up a monster
00:01:21 absolutely zero energy in a chemical bath. I'm currently drinking a coffee. It tastes like a
00:01:32 fresh diaper. I've got a juice monster energy drink. Pipeline punch right now. I'm gonna fucking
00:01:37 drown this and hopefully my tongue seared off and I can't speak anymore. Let's all hope that
00:01:44 happens. While we introduce our final special guest, longtime LGBTQ ally of the PCP, his name,
00:01:53 Icon Clasm, aka Double Shot. Icon Colts. I remember because I did fan art and never
00:02:04 showed anyone. Oh, wow. Not even Victor. That's the man. And that's the man, Victor. Victor Collins.
00:02:12 Here he is, everybody. Oh man. I just ate a big hot dog from 7-Eleven and washed it down with
00:02:18 Mountain Dew and now I feel like I'm gonna vomit. You're in the 7-Eleven food. You unerotically
00:02:24 eat 7-Eleven food. That's a thing in your life. Yeah, I mean, that's true. Victor. Almost every
00:02:31 day. And it's horrible. Your last name was Collins? I thought your last name was Brough.
00:02:36 Oh, because of... You gotta go to 7-Eleven and you gotta get a fucking buffalo chicken log.
00:02:42 Oh, those are good. I like those. Oh, no. Buffalo chicken roller log, dude.
00:02:46 Yeah, I like those. It's a very fun name. I do those for a little while and then...
00:02:52 I mean, yeah, they all make me sick. Topic, ladies and gentlemen, get the fuck out of my
00:02:59 kitchen. You're undercooking the chicken. It's cooking. You're just like your father.
00:03:07 We're talking about cooking, talking about po-boy and rich boy eats alike. They all have a place
00:03:12 in our lexicon of food. And speaking of lexicons that has nothing to do with what I'm saying,
00:03:18 also let's look at Urban Dictionary and see what the fuck is going on with cooking. Here we go.
00:03:25 Hang on. Silly me. I searched cocking by mistake, which is texting while urinating.
00:03:35 Okay, cooking. Here we go.
00:03:37 Cooking is a dance trend invented by Lil B in that it's only waste up designed to be
00:03:43 done in front of a webcam. Wait, incorrect, incorrect. I don't know anything about this
00:03:48 topic. I'm out. Cooking. Okay, cooking. This is a good one.
00:03:52 Cooking, what you better be doing right now, woman.
00:03:59 Damn. Oh, that one was funny. Okay, cooking. In reference to wannabe comedian, Dane Cook. No, okay.
00:04:06 It's when you put the food in the pan and it sizzles. That's what cooking is, when you eat food.
00:04:13 You know, what if you're not using a pan, though? I mean, that's true.
00:04:16 Then that's cold. It's not real cooking, obviously.
00:04:19 I suspect we are going to spend easily 45 minutes talking about what is or is not
00:04:24 nobody's cooking. Let's not. It's making a sandwich cooking, please.
00:04:28 No, cooking literally is the act of heating something like raw ingredients to make it meal.
00:04:34 But so temperature being involved. But here's a question, and I said this to Vic beforehand.
00:04:39 If I make ice cream, if I make ice cream, when I'm using temperature to create it in the negative,
00:04:44 the opposite direction is that cooking? No. Why? A cooker is a heating implement.
00:04:51 No, no, no, no. It's possible that for one podcast, we can like not open it with like
00:04:56 an excessive. No, no, actually, let's open the scanner worms. No, no, no. Here's why it opened.
00:05:02 Famously, I am responsible in Ben's legendary sandwich debates. I am legendary quoted as saying
00:05:09 that the American flag is a sandwich, which I stand by. Why? Because like the lines?
00:05:15 Okay, no, no, because there are layers on the American flag, which are the 13 stripes.
00:05:21 By that definition. Okay, on the bottom there's a red strip, on the top of the red strip, and
00:05:25 the middle there are white stripes. Here's Munchy. Munchy. Munchy, famously,
00:05:29 onions are known to have layers. Does that make an onion a sandwich as well?
00:05:32 No, no, because there's not, okay, there's not similar layers on the top or the bottom.
00:05:37 Look, look, look. My final word on the sandwich debate is that artist intent, artist intent
00:05:44 matters when it comes to a sandwich debate. I am definitely an author. I'm definitely an author.
00:05:47 No! A sandwich has to be deliberately assembled for the purpose of being eaten. That is why
00:05:52 the American flag certainly was. If the author died, you'd go hungry. Betsy Ross, Betsy Ross,
00:05:59 just put those stripes on there. Famous sandwich, it could tear. Yeah, yeah, yeah, James Ross was
00:06:04 like, hey hey, babe, can you give me a beer. I want to watch the game, and she came back
00:06:08 here with the American flag, and she's like, wow this is really good. You need to watch the game
00:06:12 before games were even invented. Okay, so one American revolution. Let's not have, let's not
00:06:18 have Nate make us a one-hour debate about the definition of food. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:06:21 I almost said that. Okay, here's here's what I think, I think that cooking, okay, I think that
00:06:26 making ice cream is cooking. I think that cooking is cooking is the act of, of creating food.
00:06:33 But there has to be like chemical chemical processes need to be involved like what if I make what about what about like making
00:06:40 Sushi, you know. Yeah sushi like sushi is pretty interrelated pretty elaborate. I like not anyone
00:06:48 I've got a button here. I think it might just be a British thing English thing
00:06:52 But like ovens like the other word for an oven is a cooker that which is where the word cooking
00:06:58 From the right that's not where the word comes from I would argue
00:07:02 Fucking comes from no, no, I'll kill everyone
00:07:06 Well, this is not important. She has rice and the rice has to be yeah, the rice
00:07:11 I have the best definition of cooking cooking is
00:07:15 Preparing food to an extent that if you don't like it, you'll procrastinate on it or try to get someone else to do it
00:07:21 That's not bad. Like so sushi inquires requires cooked rice
00:07:25 What about a salad making like a complicated salad with lots of stuff, okay?
00:07:29 No, no, no funny joke to like pretend that we're doing it again and be like
00:07:37 I'm interested in this the sandwich debate is
00:07:41 Go on like a salad becomes cooking if you are like like if you cook grilled chicken and put that in the salad
00:07:48 Well, of course, of course, then it's cooking
00:07:50 But otherwise it's not cooking
00:07:52 I feel like I could look I could work really long and hard on a complicated decadent salad
00:07:55 But that doesn't involve any heat being used. I feel like heat is the main
00:08:05 Because if you say if you say like oh, I'm gonna go cook
00:08:07 You know, I'm gonna go cook like this chicken or whatever
00:08:10 But you say I'm going to go make a salad because a salad does not
00:08:14 That's generally true. Hey, I see give a poster the definition of cook
00:08:17 I assume it's from like the actual dictionary.com the actual dictionary.com
00:08:23 The definition is just a prepare by mixing combining and heating the ingredients
00:08:31 But you can heat negatively by making
00:08:37 Utilitarianism
00:08:39 Totally count is a negative number a number
00:08:48 I haven't say
00:08:50 Probably about 300 episodes will probably be able to become like our own like court system because we'll have like legal
00:08:56 Fucking everything by the way, I have Nate's other thing. He's gonna say I'll just like undercut him here
00:09:01 Hey guys wouldn't be much better in Star Trek where you just push a button and food gets made for you
00:09:05 Didn't we have to spend any time cooking
00:09:09 And food is full there's literally no fuel to talk about this because just food is fuel and just get like energy bars
00:09:16 Yeah, exactly. I mean well sort of just get so I'll be the soy boy. You want to see in the world. That's my motto
00:09:24 But anyway, all right, I think we're past all that bullshit. Finally, we're never gonna be pasta
00:09:35 Yeah speaking of dead fish I think if if you say cook in a context and it sounds retarded then that's not cooking like you don't say
00:09:42 I'm gonna go cook a salad or I'm gonna go cook ice
00:09:46 Victor the voice of reason
00:09:49 We can't define it, but we know what when we see it
00:09:53 Everything I prefer I prefer to turn my strow in the kitchen
00:09:57 I like refer to it
00:10:02 Let's bust open this legendary debate that was I was first introduced to in a full episode of full metal alchemist when Winery and that stupid
00:10:08 Book girl were arguing is cooking a science or an art. It is an art. It's an art. It's a fucking art
00:10:15 Dude, what do you wait? It's a cold calculated meticulous sociopathic
00:10:21 When you're ripping up shit that no one thought of
00:10:28 Fucking literally painting is also a science. You know how to mix the code. I mean, that's true
00:10:33 I know I remember extra credits their old episodes
00:10:35 They would say that video gaming is a game design is an alchemy because it's a mixture between science and art
00:10:40 So you know
00:10:42 What the fuck is they just made that shit up
00:10:47 I just want to get
00:10:54 You know, you know like Leonardo da Vinci known alchemist because they did both science and art Wow
00:11:02 Yeah, all right. All right, you know, I always I hate this argument because you can kind of apply it to anything
00:11:07 That's true. If you decide to proceed. It's really like it's kind of like artistic intent, right?
00:11:11 Mm-hmm. It's like are you intending to make a dish that is new and is your art and you're assembling it and it's beautiful
00:11:18 Do you work at yeah, Arby's and you're just assembling a sandwich? Yeah, someone that it's not
00:11:24 And science is more of a mindset in its creation rather than the end result, but you can usually yeah
00:11:29 Yeah, so for example, if it's like, hmm, what do I like on my spaghetti the most and so like today
00:11:35 I try you know tomato sauce next day
00:11:37 I try Alfredo next day I try putting hamburger in next day
00:11:40 I try putting chicken in and I take notes about exactly how much I liked each thing and then I collect the data and make my best
00:11:46 Decisions from there that science. Well, that's I mean, all right
00:11:50 I want to severely destroy this
00:11:55 Result is if the if the only data you know acting is how much do I like it like that's not science
00:12:01 This episode being a real name guys, what is your favorite food that you can cook?
00:12:09 Sausage and eggs bird's nest which is an a which is a bread that you pull the center out of and you cook an egg
00:12:15 Inside the bread and then you eat it that way cheese. You scrambled eggs
00:12:22 Make would be like a big old slab of chicken with like on a bagel with like cheese wait wait something like that with
00:12:29 Maybe an egg or something
00:12:31 That's good. I also want to change my answer though
00:12:34 ice cream
00:12:35 You make ice cream hot damn. I have I have
00:12:51 This is not the food podcast, this is the cooking podcast so all the question left it and cooking good
00:12:57 My I like making omelettes. I make a mean omelette. I enjoy yeah the alchemy of of combining ingredients with the egg to make
00:13:11 The omelette alchemist
00:13:22 Anything is a sandwich because it's sandwiched when you eat it between the top and the bottom halves of your mouth
00:13:27 No, no
00:13:36 Okay, I want to know here. Okay. Here's my question
00:13:39 I want to go around and I want to hear from everybody because again, this is not the food podcast food doesn't matter
00:13:43 It's the cooking PCP. I want to hear about everyone's day-to-day
00:13:48 Relationship with cooking. How much do you do? How much do you fear it and are you good at it?
00:13:53 Like what do you eat? I want to I want to know I want to know everybody's thing
00:13:56 I don't like cooking just because I'm not good at it and I'm not interested and I
00:14:01 Preferably I would like to ascend to a higher plane where food no longer matters to me and it is just fuel
00:14:06 So I'm constantly moving toward a state where you're all fucking
00:14:11 No, no, there's I enjoy I enjoy the results of good cooking, but I am not good
00:14:18 Enough in the skill to cultivate it in myself
00:14:22 I like when other people cook delectable meals for me that I can enjoy
00:14:26 Yeah, but I do not want to invest my time into doing it myself because there are other things
00:14:30 I would prefer doing with that time. I don't even appreciate
00:14:35 I mean, it's not okay. Okay, if someone makes a great dish like I'll appreciate that it's good and I'll enjoy it for what it is
00:14:40 But I'll beat the shit out of them
00:14:43 But the sad fact like the sad fact that I have come to realize is that I'd be almost as happy just eating like a boiled egg
00:14:51 Like I would be almost as happy
00:14:58 Those traits that I dream about and like romanticize about every single day of my fucking life
00:15:03 They're not a day that goes by when I don't think about the timeline where I literally am Gordon Ramsey
00:15:10 The warped and twisted streets of bombed out France living pay to check paycheck fucking every bitch
00:15:17 I can and I even care about the eggs. I'm slamming together
00:15:21 Learning from the best and getting the shit beat out of me and the fucking twisted streets
00:15:25 I will say if you had like if you were all about food like there was no fucking like anime or cartoons or home sec within you
00:15:32 I was all food and you became the fuck the like the protege for Ramsey
00:15:36 You probably would be qualified for him to pass the torch to would be just like the next Jojo where there's like slightly different attributes
00:15:43 But it's ultimately the same screamy shouty man and a man Homestuck has ruined your dreams. I know right saying
00:15:50 Yeah, it's sapped away. I I
00:15:54 If left to my own devices, I will like I will make bagels
00:15:57 I will make not make but like I will eat bagels to eat ramen toast
00:16:02 I occasionally I will like do a fry up of bacon and eggs and stuff
00:16:07 But I will really go to the lengths that you know
00:16:10 My dad would go to have like a Sunday roast or anything mostly because I'm never never cooking for more than one person
00:16:18 Right, it's just me and just me I can get I can get by with like I can just buy a loaf of bread and eat that you know
00:16:26 But I what I do love because like cooking itself is like you know, I only cook when I'm hungry and by that point
00:16:32 I'm too. Oh, I'm too agitated
00:16:35 Yeah, dude, but what I love doing instead of cooking is baking. I love baking desserts cakes
00:16:43 I hate baking. I love it so much. It's something I would do even if I didn't want to eat it afterwards. I love waking and bacon
00:16:52 I
00:16:54 Don't know what you mean, but I don't want you to explain baking is too complicated and there is too much science in it
00:17:01 No, but like it's like it's like how much fucking egg
00:17:07 Science and art
00:17:13 Here's the thing with baking in with cooking usually it's like heating stuff up
00:17:17 And you have to time things to be cooked at the right time
00:17:20 Yeah, and then put them all on the plate and make sure you eat it before it gets cold
00:17:24 And you can't let things get cold because then they're gross with baking time is basically completely gone
00:17:29 It just you can do it at any time you can cook it and then you can bake it and you can prepare it
00:17:35 maybe bake it and then
00:17:37 You can just leave it in the fridge and it's just like as you know, a chocolate brownie
00:17:43 Or a thing basically and it's like there's no time investment at all. There's no time pressure
00:17:48 It's just like really relaxing like even baking a loaf of bread
00:17:53 That's true. I guess that's true. I don't know
00:17:56 But I don't really have much to say on the subject of specifically baking
00:18:00 But what I did want to say was just I don't cook a lot
00:18:03 I cook rarely which is bad because I should
00:18:06 Cook more to get the more specific nutrient requirements
00:18:09 I need instead. I'll you know kind of slap it together from stuff that's around so I want to improve that but I do
00:18:16 Generally love the feeling of once I have committed and I've cooked something great
00:18:20 And I have shared it with people and I see them and excuse me enjoying it and appreciating it that in that
00:18:26 That's kind of what I wanted to say. That's the communal aspect of cooking is the real shit. It's oh
00:18:31 Hey, it is on this podcast
00:18:34 I'm fine. I'm finally an episode right with Nate the rare Munchie Nate alliance in a PCP episode
00:18:40 It's been forged today so rare, but so powerful
00:18:45 A certain type of cooking cooking for other people is one of the most enjoyable things in this life in this life
00:18:51 I've I've met some chefs actually
00:18:54 Yeah, where it seems like people who become chefs are becoming chefs because they enjoy cooking for other people
00:18:59 It's usually like they had a grandma that taught them how to cook and that the grandma would cook for the whole family
00:19:05 And then they got inspired by that and they want to cook because they want to give other people food and not
00:19:11 Which is pretty interesting, you know, that that's what would drive someone to want to do that
00:19:15 That's kind of the way I feel about baking like I would I would bake a bunch of brownies and I would like
00:19:20 Like really enjoy giving it to the rest of the family
00:19:25 What do you think about these these chocolate things you like
00:19:30 I'm listening hippo. Don't worry. I'm listening. I'm sorry. Yes, that is great. I'm too high
00:19:36 Was there a joke I'm sorry I didn't I food episode
00:19:41 I hope like my favorite way to bond with friends or just like go out and experience the world is through restaurants
00:19:47 My favorite thing to do is just to get together by offline friends and go to restaurant and just eat together
00:19:51 something about like like the feeling of like eating like with you know, you're your relatives or people you're
00:19:58 It's just really it's better than talking alone. It just feels super like base and like and like
00:20:04 Primitive and it feels like you're a real that's true
00:20:06 I was gonna say I like I share Tom's like rage at the fact that I'm trapped in this weak fleshy
00:20:13 Prison of a body and that I have to like, you know, eat regularly to fuel it and stuff like oh, it's so annoying
00:20:19 But considering that that's the reality that I'm in like just using food as a tool to like make people like you
00:20:26 I mean, it doesn't have to be like, you know
00:20:29 maniacal or anything but just like like like
00:20:32 Eating a meal is like when everybody has to be together. Like you can't escape it. So it's a great time to like
00:20:39 Talk to people and like get to know people better and and bond just over sharing the meal with other people
00:20:44 I should have realized that me you're coming out of these different angles
00:20:47 I want I want to cook and like be around people just as a nice thing and it's like how can I like force people to be around me?
00:20:56 I'm just thinking I'm just more woke munch. I'm just more woke. I thought black pills
00:21:02 I put a few more black pills in my muffins if you know what I'm saying
00:21:07 So there's something so like a luring about the about like the chef lifestyle where whenever I watch like a high-level
00:21:14 Chef it's like they're a cowboy. It's like they're a cowboy in the old rest and they don't give a shit about anything
00:21:21 Yeah, put some salt in there just like slamming around
00:21:24 You know like like like when you when you're cooking like steak or something just picking up with your bare fucking hands
00:21:29 I don't even care. Here's anything in my hands. Just slam it on the table. I don't give a shit
00:21:34 I'm self-determined and cooking does not faze me where I don't even like food. I hate eating Gordon Ramsay doesn't eat
00:21:40 He literally just like tastes up of what he's eating. He's not having meals. That's the thing about him. That is true
00:21:47 Really? Yeah, here's here's a here's an unpopular opinion. Here's a okay. Okay. I think that food
00:21:52 I'll hit you for it. So food is food is sort of art in the in the way that porn is sort of art
00:21:58 I think food is basically all and I think that it's
00:22:05 Hear me out here me out because I kind of I kind of know where you're going with this
00:22:08 Yeah, okay food like sex is just a thing. It's just a you know
00:22:14 It's like a primal instinct. It's like a primal instinct that we're all forced that we're all forced to enjoy
00:22:19 Like like we can't help that about ourselves that we like food and you just like porn, you know
00:22:24 There's there's there's there's some pretty simple formulas
00:22:26 I mean you could get artistic with it if you wanted
00:22:28 But it's also easy to make some very satisfying and delicious food
00:22:31 Slash porn with like some easy to find ingredients. Let me just throw a shit ton of butter in there and you know
00:22:37 Whatever
00:22:39 From the perspective of a literal record
00:22:45 Though like because like butter isn't something that just naturally happens like butter is science
00:22:54 Ben I have a similar attitude towards it as you but I come to it from a very different angle
00:22:58 I see it as
00:22:59 You go back to if you just think of humans as just as an entity under themselves forget the actual
00:23:05 Context or culture there in they could be born today or 10,000 years ago, right?
00:23:09 You know food eating having sex having a shelter. It's all equally important
00:23:14 You know, maybe you'll have entertainment if you need it. So the thing is because eating and
00:23:19 Eating is a higher priority, right?
00:23:22 Humans have spent a lot longer amount of time put way more man hours into perfecting the craft of food
00:23:30 To the point that by the 20th century pretty much everyone who's you know, at least decently privileged has access to basically most food
00:23:38 Right and we've basically got it down
00:23:40 I think that over the course of thousands of years
00:23:42 There was a lot of experimentation a lot of studying a lot of stuff that feels like real art and discovery
00:23:48 but we sort of like figured it out and
00:23:51 Similarly with porn it's had a lot less time to advance but because people care about porn so hard
00:23:57 It like figured out its formula and it what it needs to be a lot quicker
00:24:02 Well, meanwhile, so we mean we figured out food because we don't know shit about nutrition people
00:24:07 Nutrition is an all-new front, but when it comes to okay, okay food that tastes good and feels satisfying sure
00:24:13 It's like hitting it's like hitting a fucking equilibrium goddamn
00:24:17 Singularity with like every single month KFC and Taco Bell is inventing a new thing
00:24:22 That's like basically another delicious
00:24:25 Look at the KFC double down and not call it aren't okay
00:24:29 I think the double down is like that's it's a meme. I really hate because all it is it's just chicken where the bread would
00:24:35 I think I think the KFC famous bowl is pretty much the pinnacle of yeah
00:24:39 Yeah, I think the whole double down me is like fucking retarded because all it is is just you're just swapping out bread with chicken
00:24:44 It's such a simple but powerful change look
00:24:49 Minimalist double down right there before us the whole time we simply need to open our eyes and realize people describing the double down is disgusting
00:24:56 I think those people are all fucking retarded, but there are other things
00:24:59 I don't see what's so bad about it's me. There's definitely fried chicken. Yeah, there's definitely
00:25:04 There's technically less carbohydrates if you get yeah double down. Yeah, well, it's a breading. Yeah, well, it's not fucking
00:25:12 It's breaded chicken, but but anyway, so meanwhile stuff like comics or fucking
00:25:19 Literature right there's like
00:25:26 They would just reach over like in the Garden of Eden Adam would reach over to the bush and pluck
00:25:43 Think about how much we figured out food like we basically know what most people like there's a restaurant for almost every sensible taste that in the book
00:25:50 Meanwhile tastes in movies or comics or books is
00:25:54 Even though we've made so much progress
00:25:55 There's still much more
00:25:57 Formulation for them to make and at this point we're probably heading towards some sort of perfection there within a hundred years or so with algorithms like
00:26:04 Data-collecting every opinion possible. I don't know. Maybe maybe maybe maybe it's possible
00:26:09 Maybe it's possible
00:26:10 I don't think that was enough that with enough like if we live in a post-singularity society
00:26:15 And we have like every fucking like everyone's making art there might be like a home stuck for every single opinion
00:26:21 You could have coming out every couple of months
00:26:24 Because the principle of diminishing returns even if a perfect story were crafted that everyone
00:26:32 Eventually become boring and we would need something else because
00:26:35 My this was I picked my words carefully a home stuck for every type of opinion coming out every two months
00:26:44 Okay, okay. What was what was Vic saying now? I want to hear I want to hear Vic twine
00:26:47 I'm gonna say I don't agree with the idea that cooking has become like this singular
00:26:51 No, it's not like actually perfect. Yeah, it's so much closer. It's so much like further up on that hill that it feels
00:26:57 I mean it might just be because like satisfying the taste buds a much simpler thing than satisfying ones like
00:27:04 We've spent media like 10,000 years
00:27:08 Advancing agriculture
00:27:10 Agree with that, but I mean is it is it crazy to think that like it is true satisfying the palette is just an objectively less
00:27:20 Someone I consider myself someone with a very unrefined palette, so maybe I don't have
00:27:24 to like comment on
00:27:26 Maybe someone with a very developed
00:27:32 For example, like oh, I don't need much at all. Oh, hey, I'll put some salt on it
00:27:36 Salt was an incredibly difficult thing to get throughout most of history
00:27:44 It's not like mentally strenuous from the from the perspective of a cook but from the broader cultural from the broader like all of society working together
00:27:51 Like the fact that you have a spice rack dude spices used to control like the commerce of the entire fucking planet, right?
00:27:59 But now it's just casual, so like they were the bitcoins of that kind of what I was getting at in the fact that there's
00:28:05 Like I still think that is going to continue to evolve because there's still resources that are more scarce
00:28:10 And like there are food trends that come out where it's like now
00:28:13 There's a million pomegranate drinks because now pomegranate is easier to farm right we're making GMO fruits that can actually fucking
00:28:20 Reproduce
00:28:22 Preservation techniques that will allow the pawpaw fruit to come back into wide circulation
00:28:28 Exactly, right exactly. I need I need pawpaw flavored
00:28:36 Fruit native to America we need it's a symbol of America
00:28:40 We have to make America great again with the pawpaw
00:28:43 Are you not referring to the pawpaw fruit from one piece that Bartholomew kuma canonically ate? No
00:28:51 It's from the pawpaw fruit. It's like they still grow in Virginia and West Virginia. It's like a it's like a virginia native
00:29:01 Because that it's not people say it's really good. It's super overpowered in one piece. It's really strong in one piece
00:29:08 GMO discussion in this episode because I feel like that might be important to cook in yeah, we could we could go off on some fucking
00:29:14 I could fucking when you like that match you can't stop
00:29:20 Do with cooking it's really more about agriculture, but I'm happy to talk about GMO to death goddamn it your pro GMO to death, huh?
00:29:29 Yeah, there's a good documentary on Hulu that you could watch that'll make it fucking red pilled for GMO's
00:29:34 Okay, basically, it's all bullshit like GMOs are fine. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it
00:29:39 It's just fucking you're you're just splicing DNA and that's completely bad
00:29:43 Like people people chemicals or pesticides. I don't know much about it, but like all it is like you just change in their genes
00:29:49 That doesn't make them like radioactive. Yeah poisonous or anything
00:29:52 Yeah, people act like it's fucking poison faster. We've been doing literally all of our species existence
00:30:02 Did you guys know the carrots used to be purple? No, no, did you guys know? Okay? Okay, you know dogs used to be wolves
00:30:09 We have dogs that can literally sneeze their own eyeballs
00:30:15 Here's something that legitimately blew my mind. Okay, like spinach broccoli
00:30:21 Broccoli cabbage Brussels sprouts called they're all the same plant. They all are they all are descendants of wild mustard
00:30:30 They were like they're the same plant that we're just selectively bred for different trades
00:30:35 Also like Brussels sprouts like a tiny tiny tiny little cabbage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know I found that out and I was like holy shit
00:30:41 That's adorable. Yeah, it is still don't like to eat like a like with bananas like they they they basically
00:30:47 It's still selective breeding is just forced into the DNA where they're just taking traits from other plants and putting them in so that
00:30:54 They won't die from like mass viruses
00:30:56 Yeah, and like without that then the economies of the places that are fucking growing the bananas would tank because all the bananas would die
00:31:02 And then we wouldn't have bananas. Yeah, yeah without GMOs. So it's like it's praise GMOs
00:31:08 And the the people that spread the fear of it like this this is a good documentary
00:31:15 Yeah, the the funding for those fucking documentaries are all coming from places like Whole Foods and shit
00:31:20 Yeah, because it's their agenda to sell all this non-GMO stuff because it's a trendy now to be fair is
00:31:26 Not positive some of the fear that like in the future
00:31:30 There will be consequences as opposed to right now of using GMOs. Is that
00:31:36 I don't
00:31:38 Would be that the the only consequence would be that like the viruses would change to
00:31:53 Sorry to interrupt. Yeah, how do I say my mic still working? You said fine. Yep
00:31:58 Like yeah, well, you know, this is all very interesting at all, but there's I think the audience really there's just one thing that came for
00:32:09 Victor I want to know about the philosophy of the po-boy eats. I just want to know everything
00:32:14 That goes on in that world
00:32:17 Tell me about it. I mean this is that the series was inspired by the fact that I cook these super simple dishes for me and hope every day
00:32:26 Almost it not every day at all, but but basically enough, but it's all I fucking know how to do
00:32:31 But like I know other fucking broke-ass dudes who are like like I have a friend who
00:32:39 Gets on me all the time for like the way I eat and stuff and he literally just eats peanut butter and granola sandwiches
00:32:44 So that he can save his money so that one day he could fucking buy a boat
00:32:47 And I'm like you are you are killing yourself. I can't eat just a peanut butter and granola sandwich
00:32:53 My dad will eat rice mixed with corn and pea. Yeah, and that that's a satisfying dinner to him
00:32:59 Like I can't do that right
00:33:02 Like you can you could be kind of broke and also make yourself food that
00:33:07 Makes you not want to kill yourself, you know, well, so everybody knows I mean in case you missed it
00:33:12 We have to link this in the show notes or wherever about the red the rad con three po-boy eat
00:33:17 That was an absolute fucking
00:33:21 Art piece that was that was definitely alchemy going on in that video for sure, right?
00:33:25 That was I got to say I tried noodles on bread
00:33:29 Like just the other day because I just thought I was cooking noodles. I was like, you know
00:33:33 I don't remember the the the you know the Victor burger being that bad. I
00:33:38 Want to try it again. I want to try noodles on bread and it was probably is quite good. Yeah
00:33:43 I'm glad that was on it. Well, the Japanese do that. They'll have like the fucking the noodles on like the hot dog buns and stuff
00:33:50 Right. Yeah, that's true though. There's like a bunch of other shit
00:33:53 Soba hot dog bun shit, right? That's right. There's people experimenting far beyond what I've been doing
00:33:59 I mean, it's just not in America. We're just we're we're
00:34:05 Yeah, hey while we're on the subject of while we're on the subject of simplistic food
00:34:09 Like I didn't end up talking about like my lifestyle with cooking. So here's the thing with me in cooking
00:34:14 The the tensions I have with it are like weird. So I love cooking. I find it therapeutic
00:34:20 I find doing the dishes to be therapeutic
00:34:22 The problem is I just never take the time to like do it because I want to like work on videos more
00:34:27 So I have the same problem as hippo where by the time I finally set about to cook
00:34:31 I'm too fucking hungry and so then it's just almond butter sandwich
00:34:34 So what I need to do what I do when I really like kind of have my shit together
00:34:37 It's just make a whole bunch of food put it in the fridge right now
00:34:40 Wait, was that it was that an almond butter sandwich or is that a was that a all the butter no almond butter sandwich?
00:34:47 Like one stick of butter
00:34:49 Okay, we're like even cashew butter sandwich, which is even better. That's good. Yeah. So like here's right now
00:34:55 I don't have a microwave though. So I can't I've just been eating like cold leftovers that I make but here's the other thing
00:35:00 It's about simplistic food, right? I only got one recently like as I was getting older as I was like, you know becoming 15 16 17
00:35:06 Some of my friends were like, oh wow you cook food. That's like so helpful, right? I'm like, oh, I'm a helpful person who cooks
00:35:12 I don't know and so then leading up to moving in to the bro house with digi and Victor and
00:35:20 Tom been and whatnot. I'm like, okay, so I guess I cook maybe I'll be useful for cooking
00:35:23 But then when it turns out is oh the reason why people don't cook is that they want to have like actual food and not just like
00:35:30 Something that you make with like three ingredients, which is what I always eat like I'm just like, okay
00:35:34 What the ingredients do I have? Oh boy? I have some chicken. Oh, I have a spinach. Oh, I have a
00:35:40 Mushrooms or I have some onions of carrots. All right. I'll saute this and I'm like that's for me is like as good of a meal as I can have
00:35:46 Like I'm not quite as crazy about like weirdly simplistic meals. Okay with that. That sounds pretty good to me. I mean, I don't know
00:35:53 I don't know like that like
00:35:55 Because like I'll eat like rice broccoli and a chicken breast. Yeah, that's like decade because did you was saying like yeah?
00:36:00 You know, I just don't like cooking. I can't I can't I don't know how to cook
00:36:03 I'm like, oh, well, dude, if you want to know how to cook all you gotta do is just make spaghetti, right?
00:36:07 Then the next day or whenever you feel like making spaghetti again make it with like hamburger meat or chicken meat, right?
00:36:12 Then next time put in some like mushrooms and green peppers in there, right?
00:36:16 So just keep making spaghetti and amp up the fucking ingredients one at a time, right?
00:36:21 Yeah, but then like digi then like a month later in another episode of digi, bro
00:36:26 He's like, huh divus telling me how to make spaghetti. I know how to make spaghetti
00:36:30 Like he basically what he was saying is the reason why he doesn't want to cook does see though
00:36:35 The reason why he can't cook by his own definition is that he wants cooked food to be like more complex
00:36:40 And not like the way that his dad would eat food
00:36:43 So what I found out is that even though I like making food
00:36:46 I don't like making food for other people because people don't ever want to eat what I'm gonna make for the most part
00:36:54 The food that I've seen you cook is pretty weird
00:36:58 It's pretty well, you'll have like it's just like I don't rice
00:37:00 You'll have like brown rice like a piece of chicken and then like a pile of like
00:37:06 steamed shredded carrot or something
00:37:11 Ever care about like the I don't maybe I just hate carrots
00:37:14 I mostly don't care about like the the precise execution like the difference between like exactly how long you might want to
00:37:21 Royal something or like breading something correctly or like having the like ratio of ingredients be correct
00:37:28 I became cognizant of this when like when did you was saying like oh?
00:37:32 You know the reason you go to Kevin's doghouse is because it's got the perfect ratio of bun to wiener to chili and I'm like
00:37:38 Oh, yeah ratios. I kind of don't care. I just sort of think what are some ingredients?
00:37:42 I like do those ingredients go well together put them together like it's just very caveman like for me and that
00:37:50 That's why it's so fucking cowboy like these it's because you don't have to give a shit to cook
00:37:55 You do not have to care and that's what makes cook so cool
00:37:59 Is that they're just constantly like cynical and pessimistic and they have no passion or life left on your body?
00:38:08 My approach to cooking
00:38:10 Fucking bowls together and outcomes when when I pause pause pause. What was Gibbs say?
00:38:17 Well, I was gonna say my dad. Yeah, he's like been cooking his whole life
00:38:20 And he's like the cook of the family and he's like really really good in it
00:38:23 I love any cooks, but when I was trying to learn from him like I was like, okay
00:38:28 I got a I got a I got a step up to the plate. I got to try and cook things and
00:38:32 He doesn't have like he doesn't know timings for anything
00:38:36 He just like over the course of being a cook for so long. Yeah, he just
00:38:41 Instinctively knows how long you're supposed to cook a piece of thing and at what temperature
00:38:45 I have to keep asking him what temperature do I reheat this thing at what about this?
00:38:50 How long do I go and just go just go until it's brown and then put the thing and yeah
00:38:54 I'm like that like I know like in my heart of heart when the chicken is probably done
00:39:00 Yeah, but you know, it's like jazz man. Yeah
00:39:05 Yeah, when I when I cook I will like I'll start cooking with a thing in mind
00:39:09 I won't check to see if we have the ingredients
00:39:11 I will just kind of start going and then I'll just I'll just make whatever
00:39:16 Substitutions, I feel like right you want to talk to it. I do a cowboy. So hi
00:39:22 Yeah, yeah
00:39:25 Oh, yeah
00:39:26 So like the the reason why I wanted Ben to be on this episode is that me and Ben?
00:39:30 Well, I played witness to Ben trying to make his infamous like rhubarb pie shit
00:39:36 Back it was it was the it was the devoo bar pie. It was a strawberry rhubarb pie with blueberries
00:39:42 That's good, but the thing is I'm gonna make this rhubarb pie, right?
00:39:46 And you're like, okay
00:39:48 Well, let me look at the ingredients and one by one by one by one by one
00:39:51 You had like maybe two out of the ten ingredients and just
00:39:57 Substituted and substituted over and over and over again. Whoa. Some of the substitutions were legit. Yeah
00:40:06 And it was just the most Ben experience I've ever had
00:40:11 Turned out like what were you left with okay? It turned out okay?
00:40:13 It would have been a fine pie
00:40:15 The only thing was that there was not enough filling so the filling kind of baked down into just kind of like a film
00:40:22 So it kind of just became like really thin bars of like pie crust with kind of a thin gooey like layer of
00:40:30 You know of devoo bar
00:40:32 Okay, the top of it. It was right. I mean it wasn't gross or anything, but it was not a pie
00:40:39 Yeah, we were looking for rhubarb and like we literally went like all around Virginia fucking beach even to like the Asian food
00:40:45 Sort to find rhubarb. There was just no fucking rhubarb anywhere. We grow that shit in our fucking garden up. Yeah
00:40:50 Yeah, I think it's I think it's more of a northern thing. Yeah, I guess so
00:40:55 Bites into that and he thinks you know, I could have eaten the hard-boiled egg. That's the problem Ben
00:41:00 It's not the food. It's that you're making a weird filmy disgusting like fish tank food
00:41:05 by
00:41:07 um
00:41:08 You guys remember who was who was there for it when I made the um the the Swedish fish flavored fried Oreos
00:41:15 that no
00:41:17 During a round like I was there at Radcon
00:41:21 You and me made Dorito a breaded fried chicken. I remember I remember. Yeah, they didn't really really taste like Doritos
00:41:29 They needed to be dusted with Dorito dust after frying like right not before
00:41:35 Remember the fucking crock pot
00:41:38 Chernobyl crock pot the crock pot. Okay. Do you remember? Okay. Do you remember the final days of the crock pot?
00:41:44 Well, I remember the time when it well when there was that one crock pot that dragged out for a couple of days
00:41:49 Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, like we had like chicken and vegetables in the crock pot
00:41:53 This was like this was right before we retired it for good. Yeah
00:41:58 So there were chicken and vegetables in there and it had been cooking for it had been in there hot for like two days
00:42:03 It was very dried out. It was not well
00:42:05 So what I did was we went we went to the supermarket and I picked up some cans of soup
00:42:10 I got like cheese and beer flavored soup
00:42:13 And I just
00:42:15 Cheese and beer flavored soup
00:42:18 And mix them with
00:42:22 To moisten it up so I could eat it again
00:42:24 Right, right
00:42:26 Ben like set a crock pot and like the mid-afternoon
00:42:29 And I thought it was Digi's crock pot for some reason and like I had heard that the crock pot was done
00:42:35 It was supposed to be done at 10 p.m. 10 p.m
00:42:37 10 p.m. Comes and I'm the only one still awake and I thought well, it's Digi's crock pot Digi's relatively responsible
00:42:45 He'll remember but it was actually Ben's crock pot. I assume he was asleep. So the next morning comes up
00:42:50 I wake up and I'm like, I'm hearing a sizzling. What's the sizzling?
00:42:54 And I look and I see the crock pot has been on full blast all fucking night. It's all dried up and
00:43:00 Like and Digi comes down. I was like, oh shit Ben's gonna have to throw this away
00:43:04 Then Ben wakes up and he's like hmm. I don't think I had to throw this away
00:43:08 So like you just like neither of us like take a single stab at it
00:43:12 We don't even want to like be in the same zip code, but you're like nibble nibble
00:43:16 I mean, I mean, you know nibble nibble and yeah
00:43:19 You eventually get like fucking like cheese and beer soup like so like basically just make it worse
00:43:25 Just to make it fucking worse. That's and to me. There's a certain logic
00:43:28 That's the perfect summary of the experience of living in that house at that time
00:43:33 It was that there was always some sort of disturbing black mess crock pot
00:43:41 That crock pot on he left the crock pot on on warm right he didn't even like put it in the fridge
00:43:46 He just left it on warm for like a couple more fucking days
00:43:51 Continuing to nibble at it before he finally gave up and it was like all crusted and dried at the bottom
00:43:56 The whole kitchen smelled like ass it was just like
00:44:02 The beer and cheese soup gave it a very strange smell
00:44:11 Two separate soups a beer soup and a cheese
00:44:13 One can soup it was okay and cheese flavor soup. Yeah, okay
00:44:16 It was a real thing more than anyone in this group needs to have his needs to star in a sitcom
00:44:22 Just this man who's just everything about life and existence for him as a total failure
00:44:26 But he's so complacent with it and so chill about it that it seems like he's doing it on purpose
00:44:30 And it's actually really cool
00:44:33 I resent that a lot. I'll fucking end you good tonight
00:44:38 That's the creamer of real life in some ways
00:44:42 Here's the rub. Yeah, is don't be don't be like this. Don't do this. Why not it's good. It worked out
00:44:50 I got I got no down to that crock
00:44:53 Don't give a shit Donald's don't go to der Wiener schnitzel. Don't go to fucking Burger King
00:45:00 Don't just learn just learn the real shit. That's fucking easy
00:45:04 Put some butter in a pan get the pan hot and put it in the egg you will be satisfied by just
00:45:18 So this is this is my secret to being a cooking boy and
00:45:21 And keeping it going and cooking every day and do it and cooking real meals that aren't just bullshit and it's having a
00:45:28 Girlfriend who is way more responsible than I am
00:45:31 It's a good it's an ultimate secret my uh, yeah, that's a pretty good she goes and makes lists of shit and
00:45:38 Gets ingredients and goes and bides them and then all I have to do is assemble them and cook them
00:45:43 And it's easy because it's all planned for me. Yeah, and I don't have to do shit
00:45:47 That is the best way to keep cooking in your life. It's it's so difficult and because I live with my parents still
00:45:53 Yeah, and like my dad is is the cook boy. He cooks
00:45:58 Like he has meals planned like way ahead of time like I'm gonna cook a fucking a curry today
00:46:03 And then we're gonna have a lot of roast lamb
00:46:06 You know whatever and he's like he has all these ingredients in the fridge
00:46:09 And I don't know what I can use and what I can so I did I never get the chance to use
00:46:15 Let to learn cooking myself. I really should like
00:46:19 Like I feel like I would be able to keep track of it if I had with the fridge to of my own
00:46:26 But it's kind of how I felt that's a fridge with a yeah with my
00:46:30 With my family like my mom was the one who does the cooking primarily, but like she wouldn't do it all the time
00:46:35 It would be like hmm point it'd be like
00:46:39 two out of every third day, right and
00:46:42 The thing is is that most of the time we would just make meals for ourselves
00:46:45 I think my dad was like the only one who would like he would basically just rely upon them food that my mom made
00:46:50 He did as leftovers or he'd get work all the time
00:46:52 So he would have lunches out
00:46:54 But everyone else in the family just basically makes their own shit like I make my own shit
00:46:58 And I think my younger brother and sister took after me as a result because even though we generally like almost all the food that our mom makes
00:47:06 We just want to eat when we want to fucking eat, right like yeah me and my brother both like
00:47:12 When we like hit puberty we both became like massive needs we'd be up at totally random times
00:47:17 So it's like I want to have fresh food and I want it to be exactly the amount of fucking proteins
00:47:21 I need right now. So that's how I got into the habit of just like cooking some stupid thing for myself
00:47:27 The result of this is that the dishes in our kitchen were completely out of control 24-7 and they remain so to this day
00:47:35 I'm glad I moved out. I probably we should probably do a whole isolated episode about dish washing
00:47:41 I can definitely get an episode worth of that
00:47:43 Damn, I think dish washing is just part of cooking. You should consider that part of cooking fucking wash your shit immediately
00:47:49 Afterwards, I mean, I will never be a problem. Okay. I'm gonna spoil the upcoming the eventual dish washing episodes
00:47:56 Just right now, right? Here's the thing about that
00:47:59 It depends on your cooking habits
00:48:01 My mom would have a number of times where she would kind of snap and be like, okay from now on
00:48:07 You're always washing the dishes right after we're done cooking, right and inevitably invariably
00:48:13 Every time she has that snap in like the like early afternoon come late evening
00:48:18 She'll have a moment where she cooked something and she's fucking tired
00:48:22 Like there was one time where she was really adamant about it
00:48:25 She was really adamant about it and then that night she makes fucking muffins
00:48:30 And then there's just five fucking crusty muffin tins on the countertop, but I'm like hey mom
00:48:36 What's up with that whole cleaning thing, right? She's like I know I know because here's the thing about it
00:48:41 Is that by the time you're done cooking?
00:48:44 You're a completely different fucking person like
00:48:51 Fucking hungry now you eat the food by the time you're done eating the food
00:48:54 You've like the time of your life that you spent dirtying those dishes
00:48:58 That's like a long past memory you're you've moved on you need to move on with your life
00:49:02 The only way to do it is just have dedicated time where it's like there's a pile of dishes
00:49:07 I'm gonna fucking shred
00:49:10 The way to do it the way to do it is not to do it right after you've finished eating is to wait like a couple hours
00:49:18 Or at least before you go to bed
00:49:22 What me and Hope will do is that we will have washed most of the dishes by the time we're even finished cooking like as soon as
00:49:33 You can do that I think that's ideal
00:49:37 The problem is it depends on what you're cooking because it's like for example
00:49:40 Oh, you know what actually kills it for me almost everything I cook is fucking fried or like sauteed right you can't cook a hot-ass thing
00:49:46 Right after it's done you you have to let it cool a bit and some of that shit's gonna congeal
00:49:51 You can't just touch it right now. So like you have no choice but to put it off for a while
00:49:56 You know okay, okay?
00:49:57 Sometimes sometimes you get a dish that is like really crusty and sticky and then you know you soak it and you let it sit for a while
00:50:04 Personally, I think it probably is the most efficient to clean immediately
00:50:08 I kind of like to do like a big like to clean a load of dishes at once
00:50:13 I know it means passionately dishes are in the sink and it's and it's lame
00:50:17 But I like to just do it all I mean I end up doing that Ben
00:50:21 But the thing is I end up getting to a place of great anger at the world at those dishes that are piled up
00:50:27 And it makes my life worse like I've never do it because I'm like yay time to wash the dishes
00:50:32 It's always fuck. I cannot put this off any longer
00:50:35 Now I have to fucking wait into this hellscape and do the dishes for me what made my what makes me but my whole by the way
00:50:41 Once I'm actually doing the dishes. It's not so bad. It's it's the preparation to be like fine
00:50:45 I love washing dishes because I think it's really satisfying and therapeutic
00:50:49 It's just I I want to get back to work and that's the problem with me and my whole family is that we're always my whole family are like
00:50:55 What am I doing next type of people right like my dad's someone who it's like if he has 15 minutes to wait to go to work
00:51:00 He's gonna like come up with something to do that'll make him just like 15 seconds late, right?
00:51:05 So we're all like that so none of us want you to continue
00:51:09 Harboring over the fucking like food that we just made and continue to like keep cleaning dishes, right?
00:51:14 We wanted like move on to the next thing because now we have all this new renewed after meal energy
00:51:19 So like the the thing with that is
00:51:23 Fuck I don't know where I was going with that. So yeah
00:51:26 I
00:51:29 Want to just gotta do it man. Just gotta do it. Yeah, but
00:51:33 There's other stuff I gotta do because like when you have a well one of the problem
00:51:39 When you have a stay-at-home job, then you have a choice, but to like yeah when you got a stay-at-home job
00:51:44 It's really challenging and it really means that you know
00:51:47 You got a budget your time because you don't have the kind of free time with someone who works 9 to 5 in an office or anything
00:51:56 I know you're being sarcastic then but it's like
00:51:58 It's fucking when you have a 9 to 5 there's these clear borders of when you are or are not working, right?
00:52:05 But when there's always a video project left to be made just in the other room
00:52:10 It's always nagging at me. So what I want to do is I want to have no I know what you mean
00:52:13 I do I want to have a dedicated time each day where I'm cooking and cleaning at the same time
00:52:18 Simultaneously and then everything is clean and then like all the leftovers I'll need for tomorrow or in the fridge
00:52:23 That's what I need to do
00:52:24 I just need to manage that as a giant chunk and just wipe it all out in one go. I
00:52:30 Structure to that point. I
00:52:33 Have a certain level of fear that when I go full-time doing YouTube stuff that my my lack of an
00:52:39 inherently rigid rigid cold schedule
00:52:42 It's the toughest thing. It'll be an issue. Like they say when you become your own boss, you have to hate yourself like a boss.
00:52:46 You just be able to make your own schedule. You're just gonna be able to like like
00:52:50 Regally like like make his own hours
00:52:52 Well, you know that that's the thing that to do like that is the way to go and like to try to stick to that
00:52:57 But like if my my personal like internet creation career thing has kind of been an exercise in
00:53:05 Finding ways to not have to rely on my own willpower and instead putting on it like like by making like we Agua like I have to get
00:53:12 One done every week. There's no choice like you can't procrastinate or I mean I am right now
00:53:17 But you know what I've been doing for the last several months
00:53:20 I've been experimenting with this over the last year
00:53:21 But I've been doing it hardcore for the last couple months is don't don't schedule myself
00:53:26 But just keep track of what I'm doing which is interesting cuz CGP Grey just like did a Q&A where he mentions that that's what he does
00:53:31 too so like I just track how many how how many minutes in the day I spent working and then doing chores and then
00:53:38 Fapping and then doing nothing and then like watching stuff, right and then sleeping
00:53:42 So then I just look at the numbers and the numbers that just sort of constantly reminding me
00:53:47 It's like a pat on the fucking shoulder like bro. Hey, hey, wake up
00:53:50 You know, it always makes me think about it like okay, and that keeps me awake
00:53:53 I'm now. Maybe I don't know shit about shit, but I feel the need to ask has that actually work because I
00:54:01 Mean like to my view it seems kind of like you've fallen completely off the map
00:54:06 Well, yes, there have been other things that have made me like not well as I've been
00:54:12 Checking the numbers. Yes, there've been like huge stretches of time where I'm barely like putting in like even part time hours, right?
00:54:18 And I'm trying my best and I'm trying to crawl out of it. I think I am I've been saying that a bunch of times though
00:54:24 You know, it's fucking you know in a relationship having basically doubled my family amount
00:54:30 You know what I mean? So like just all sorts of stuff flies in
00:54:34 Well, he doesn't need to defend himself
00:54:36 Although I probably fall off the map because I'm trying to be less of an internet personality
00:54:41 But I guess I'm on podcasts more now. So I guess I'm failing at that. Yeah
00:54:46 Getting back to cooking. I
00:54:49 Remembered something that is like the perfect like the most fun cooking that I actually do love a lot
00:54:57 And I hope a lot of you agree
00:54:59 Being a barbecue chieftain
00:55:02 What is it with sitting sitting at the barbecue by the way, it's like universal
00:55:06 I the idea is that moms are the cookers, right?
00:55:08 But barbecuing on the on the thing outside is always a hundred percent dad. I
00:55:15 Well, here's the thing with that my dad has sort of like relegated that to me and I have like leapt it up like that
00:55:21 That's my favorite thing to do. I am yeah
00:55:24 I'm now the dad when it comes to barbecuing and it's like that Tim and Eric skit when when Eric is like
00:55:30 Children, I'm just gonna be one of you now
00:55:32 That's our new dad. I'm just one of the kids now. That's what your dad's done to you. You've been promoted. He's demoted because like
00:55:38 It's it's I took a great side when I moved out of the house and moved in to my own place when we we bought a grill
00:55:45 And I was like, all right, I am the new grill master. Yeah, I'm my dad did this and I'm gonna do this now
00:55:51 And this is my thing and it's it's fun
00:55:54 With grilling and cooking anything you are not beheld into any when you restaurant or to any cook
00:56:00 Yeah, your mom or to your dad you were making your own shit. Yeah for your own path
00:56:05 I just do literally so great
00:56:08 And you can just do whatever the fuck you want these fucking munchies
00:56:13 Let's give go. He was he was coming. Yeah. Yeah. What's so good reason? It's so it's so good is because
00:56:19 Um
00:56:20 When you are like the main guy doing the cooking everybody comes to you as like the leader of what's happening currently
00:56:27 And so like you put the meat on and then somebody else. So can I get you anything kind of do you need like a
00:56:34 Shall I bring the the next set of like kebabs or whatever bring you the next version for you to impregnate?
00:56:40 Yeah, and then people are like willing to that because standing in front of a barbecue on a hot day
00:56:45 It's like a big whoosh of hot air and it's like ow. It hurts. It hurts my eyes, but I love being there
00:56:50 It's like being a blacksmith. It's but it's like it's like sweating and like and like smoke all over my face
00:56:56 And I'm like I'm smashing these sausages onto the grill and I'm looking at them crisp up
00:57:01 And and I got my apron and my tools and I'm like, I'm the coolest guy and the best thing about it
00:57:07 It's during a party this happened once
00:57:09 It may happen again where there was a barbecues a summer like last year
00:57:13 I was barbecuing and there's a bunch of people around and they are like people my parents know and I don't really know them
00:57:20 They're all drinking and talking and having a good time
00:57:22 And I'm the barbecue boy which means that nobody has to come and talk to me about anything because the barbecues tucked away
00:57:28 And I'm just providing food
00:57:29 I'm just saying I'm like my brother would come here talk to me because he doesn't like talking to anyone either
00:57:34 And he would be the one bringing the fruit from me to the kitchen
00:57:37 So like I got to not I get to not participate in the party, but still be
00:57:42 Like a non-anti-social person and cartoons don't work out hippo
00:57:47 You could do the job of being the like four armed
00:57:51 Heat guy from spirit of the way who like gets the fire going for the boilers and shit
00:57:55 That's he basically looks like he already like when you have that like half mustache beard thing going on, right?
00:58:01 Yeah, it's true
00:58:03 Coming off of what hippo said I think one of the reasons that like
00:58:07 Barbecuing appeals to dads and it's kind of like that male thing my wife
00:58:10 That I think it's like it's something you like you want to be outside doing something a little bit
00:58:16 Barbecuing is something to do and then it's also a great excuse to have a bunch of beers
00:58:20 Yeah, like sit there and grill like my dad always did it when he always be drinking beers
00:58:25 And then when I barbecued I like basically got drunk while as barbecuing and had a blast right because you're outside
00:58:30 Yeah, and I'm outside alone
00:58:32 So I'm like I the only way to pass the time is really to like fucking drink a bunch of beers
00:58:36 Well, you're sitting there barbecuing. Yeah, and you're having a blast
00:58:39 And you can't you can't like get roped into any stupid conversation because you're like, oh, sorry
00:58:43 I gotta I gotta pay attention to this, you know the stuff
00:58:45 This is important, you know late in my career as a son
00:58:49 When I when I live with my parents still the thing is grilling became sort of a vital component of like everyday meals
00:58:57 So like we we would grill out on like the deck where the where the thing was like all the time and the problem is I don't share
00:59:04 Exactly the same, you know manly trope of how great barbecuing is because it became just like a family cooking thing
00:59:10 They're like I would do a lot. I'm you know bend it sometimes
00:59:13 I remember having to do it a lot and it was just like a thing that I was expected to do and it was like it was like
00:59:18 My dad was the real boss. I was just the fire monkey who had to go out and you know prepare
00:59:24 Yeah, you know and it was it hurt my feelings. I didn't get to be a big boy
00:59:28 They sucked all the fun. I like it was it was fine. It was fine. It was just a chore though
00:59:33 Yeah, yeah, I was not master of my domain, which I think was the difference here
00:59:37 My dad would only ever barbecue like once a year. Yeah, it was always a big deal
00:59:42 Like it was this rare phenomenon that we were grilling and it's like oh man
00:59:46 This is the coolest thing basically instead of being a cook. I was just a cook
00:59:54 About like that that being on a hot day and having that hot grill blow smoke into your face
00:59:59 There's something so satisfying about like being in pain, you know
01:00:05 About doing something hard that like physically harm you not like emotionally like work really like like hurts you and burns like like
01:00:11 Like I'm sure like you know mining at night getting your hands all chapped and like
01:00:17 I do not like that before in my life. So thank you. Yeah, that's what I'm I
01:00:22 Defaulted that cuz I'm a fucking idiot
01:00:24 hard labor hard labor feels great just to do like gardening gardening digging up weeds destroying like like
01:00:31 Stumps, it's great
01:00:34 Labor to like accomplish something that you know is good and that you want to do and it's just like of your own accord
01:00:39 You're like, you know, I'm gonna be a fucking man. I'm gonna get down in the dirt. I'm gonna grovel. I'm gonna flop around like a fucking pig
01:00:45 I'm the poor mud over my fucking spread-ass eagle
01:00:49 Shit, I'm gonna fucking be a man
01:00:52 Or even just like going on like a long hike through like the woods like that's like physical and it's like
01:00:57 Ah, I've accomplished this, you know. Yeah, I don't mean I don't do I don't do physical labor or physical exercise
01:01:04 Oh, the only muscle that I ever work out is my brain is your brain. Yeah, there we go. Also my my my my ethics
01:01:15 I mean, yeah, the three form a whole eternity
01:01:20 He said like in one episode
01:01:26 Maybe conscience would be a better word, I think your brain is a huge fucking muscle, bro
01:01:30 That's why I like yeah one time Rush Limbaugh was like people always say rush. Why don't you ever work out?
01:01:35 Why don't I ever see you like even like lift anything or like do anything physical?
01:01:39 It's because you all don't see the cylinders firing at full strength in my
01:01:48 You said Rush Limbaugh, yeah, yeah, okay, okay. Well, what a fucking idiot
01:02:01 If I if I did any physical activity, it would take okay
01:02:05 It would divert power away from my brain cylinders
01:02:07 But Rush Limbaugh is a big fatty and L is canonically like a tennis warrior gladiator champion. So yeah, I'm just saying
01:02:14 There's something so sad
01:02:16 It's fine not being able to like give another human and like like a share in the thing
01:02:21 You're giving another human of like giving them like the primal desire of eating food
01:02:25 But not having to be like a weird like like societal commitment like sexes
01:02:30 And a friendly ordeal where you just share and being a human and bleeding and weeping together
01:02:37 And you have your bread or your cheese and you can talk and you can catch up
01:02:42 It's just a warm homely ever that doesn't have any societal pressures on it. It's this like a cursed forced
01:02:50 heterosexual
01:02:51 Relationships I'm forced to engage in you know
01:02:54 Just just the the the feeling of joy
01:02:58 Yeah, through a chaotic, you know, just just
01:03:02 Just happen to happen J. Oh crystal charging sesh with the boys. No, that's that's pure
01:03:08 That's what life is really about. Hey, are we gonna start a PCD club?
01:03:11 What's the D for Pete the D club? You don't know about the D club. Oh the D club, of course, of course, I mean yes
01:03:24 Radcon D
01:03:28 The fourth one will be next so D would work. Yeah, damn. That's a good idea
01:03:33 I've got like one last story about like primal cooking. Yeah, cuz I've been camping a couple times
01:03:39 No, it's like we get like a log fire going and you know the the obvious like marshmallows is like nobody fucking does that
01:03:46 What we used to do was we got like um
01:03:49 We got like a potato and we wrapped it in tinfoil and we just threw it in the fire
01:03:56 And and and sweet corn as well
01:03:58 Mm-hmm. I remember making egg bread out in the woods and I don't know how we did that eggie that was strange
01:04:03 Oh, yeah, eggie bread is like when you when you get an egg and you whisk it up and then you dip the bread in the egg
01:04:15 Because they're mortal enemies
01:04:19 No, nothing
01:04:24 You call them french fries chips they come chips. Oh, right. Well, no, I know that we have
01:04:30 We have for it. We have fries, which are like this thin like McDonald's things. Yeah, but then chips are like chunkier
01:04:39 So chips are the good fries
01:04:42 So you go so when you go to McDonald's when you go to McDonald's you order fries not chips
01:04:46 Yeah, well, they they ask that that's they've always been like an Americanized restaurant chain. They don't change
01:04:56 With cheese winners the metric system that's what fucking pulp fiction talked about so I think well
01:05:01 That's just the name but but I mean this I mean in Japan. They have whole different sandwiches and shit at McDonald's
01:05:08 Yeah, fucking bizarre we got spaghetti. Are we done are we done talking about cooking now should we
01:05:17 Away like nothing
01:05:20 Yeah, I mean not I don't know anything I was gonna ask if like okay
01:05:26 If each of you guys had to recommend to our fair audience something for them to cook. Oh, what would you recommend? Oh, right?
01:05:33 I recommend. Oh, is that hard to make though, Ben? How do you make that?
01:05:37 You just fucking get some you know, I mean you coated in some egg and some flour and so whatever the hard you could coat it in
01:05:44 Like anything you want you just cut anything you got a fire
01:05:49 You just fucking deep you get a deep fryer. Can't you just make it in a pan?
01:05:52 I'd like 20 bucks. You can put oil in a saucepan and deep fryer thing. Yeah
01:06:00 Here's my recommendation if the way that I described the way I cook and the things I eat sounded interesting to you dear viewer
01:06:06 Like what I like to call it is the water saute
01:06:09 Which is like to do the kind of meals I mentioned with the chicken and the you know the carrot and the mushroom and the spinach and just
01:06:16 Instead of using oil just use like water and just like keep that's steaming
01:06:24 I know I know it's steaming but instead of like having a thing like where like you know
01:06:28 There's water beneath it and you know the steam comes up like you're cooking chicken like you put the chicken in there when this chicken is like
01:06:34 50% cooked that's when you can add the carrots when everything is like 98% done
01:06:38 That's when you could put on the the spinach because that's just shrivels up really quickly
01:06:42 But yeah, like it is basically a saute in my opinion because it's all like in a thing
01:06:46 It's not it's not just steam you're using water
01:06:48 Just keep adding water and then you can just like basically eat stuff that I think tastes pretty good with basically like no
01:06:55 Like you know shitty things for you, you know, there's not even any butter or oil, right? It's just like the fat of the chicken
01:07:01 So that's my recommendation
01:07:04 My recommendation would be just think of something you've always wanted to know how to cook
01:07:09 Google it get the ingredients and just cook it with your phone
01:07:16 Where you can keep track of every single thing you have in your fridge and it'll like algorithmically like pick out like recipes
01:07:22 Oh, no fuck that true
01:07:27 I hate regimenting things like that
01:07:29 I'd rather just like be like on a whim like I want to learn how to cook a Spanish omelette
01:07:34 I Google Spanish omelette recipe and then I just make it and I just look at my phone. It's great
01:07:39 You got a guy have that adversity like oh, you gotta look in your fridge and be like, oh, what's here?
01:07:43 It's not a whole lot here. I guess I guess there's no but like it's I can do make this
01:07:47 I mean, it's it's intimidating the idea that you're supposed to just become like a person who
01:07:53 Inherently knows what you need to put into a thing
01:07:56 I think if you want to get into cooking start by learning recipes and eventually you'll figure out that you yeah
01:08:01 Like what you can you know, how do you know what you can change about a risk?
01:08:07 Yeah, sure watch chopped all the time
01:08:10 How do you like how do you learn how to play guitar like if you want to be like an excellent like jazz guitarist?
01:08:15 Like the first thing you do is you like learn to play like a song and then you like look up
01:08:20 Exactly what to do and then as you go. Yeah, just kind of learn like okay
01:08:24 So I've learned I've learned you see repeating patterns of how songs are and cooking is similar to that in the sense of the the way
01:08:31 You can like you know extrapolate and apply things in different ways and all that kind of stuff. So yeah
01:08:36 Let me say you could you could go and learn how to like make a sauce, you know
01:08:40 And like go to the roots of like don't just buy prego try to make sauce and then you'll see like how things go together
01:08:47 You know and how things are actually made in
01:08:50 In the cooking world indeed Tom, can you speak for like three minutes straight so you earn your $30?
01:08:58 Is gay
01:09:01 I've had nothing to contribute to this topic at all
01:09:06 Well fair enough
01:09:10 Okay
01:09:11 Just make a fucking steak. Here's what you do. Here's what you do
01:09:15 You just put on a fucking steak and you move it with your hand you move it with your hand
01:09:20 Oh, no, no, you scrape a steak and you just fucking pick it up
01:09:25 Wait, wait, you don't even you don't even like pick it up like like from the top
01:09:28 You scoop it up with the burning oil in the pan and you slather it all over your fucking face
01:09:34 I'm
01:09:36 Literal cooking tip when you put when you're cooking a steak and you put it down in the pan
01:09:40 Never move it well not never but like don't move it around to cook it because you need to let the the skin like
01:09:47 Crisp up and harden and when it slides around on its own then you can flip it
01:09:51 Oh, if you move it around it likes it'll like break apart and it'll be gross
01:09:56 Moisture in there. I always want to move my food around when I'm watching it cook. It's a bad. It's not stakes
01:10:01 It's a bad idea. Okay. You're supposed to like you're supposed to like make steaks in the pan and the frying pan
01:10:07 And then I put it in the oven, right?
01:10:10 Real estate
01:10:12 Has everyone laid out their food recommendation? Well, no, we're in the middle of it got to I know I know like once this is done
01:10:19 That's basically it. I
01:10:21 Don't know maybe it anyway
01:10:25 All right, just just checking
01:10:28 Why were you talking about wait?
01:10:40 Here's here's my cooking recommendation don't do it. Here's this is this is what I'm saying
01:10:52 Money and you won't have to do it anymore. I mean that's just get better at your job and make more money
01:10:56 I mean, that's a good recommendation too, but here's what I'm actually saying. Here's my real recommendation
01:11:00 I cooking is nice and I like the communal aspects and all that stuff, but better than that is
01:11:07 Like saving any time that currently is used cooking so my recommendation is to those
01:11:14 asshole soy boys out in you know fucking the West Coast that makes soil and whatnot make a real version
01:11:21 that's not some gay soy shit and
01:11:23 So that I can be a man and made a pure animal product puree
01:11:28 Invent a new thing that
01:11:30 Wait, I'm shattering the fucking paradigm right now
01:11:34 Break out of the box. There's a soil and competitor called a hue fuel with an H and it has
01:11:42 No, so you say thank God
01:11:46 I mean, I don't I don't the soy is not actually a problem, but like I don't know what like the new I have not looked at
01:11:52 Like the nutritional facts here. Here's what I want. It's not the size of the problem. It's the boys the boys in that soil
01:11:57 That's a problem. Listen. It's the
01:12:00 I want a slurry. I can just chug at any moment of the day and I just want to be able to
01:12:07 I don't give a shit is it is like an IV drip of vitamins in
01:12:13 Literally what I want. That is exactly what I want. I fuck eating. I'll literally give it up. I don't care
01:12:18 I just want enough to worry about it
01:12:20 Have you tried pissy baby food?
01:12:27 Suckling I would not be perhaps I fucking I fucking would not be surprised if there's like an adult baby food
01:12:37 Pedialyte pedialyte that like yeah, yeah, have you seen recently on Twitter?
01:12:42 They're rebranding it that it's not just for babies because they want
01:12:51 That's literally their their their slogan is not just for babies. Oh my god. This ain't your daddy's baby food
01:12:59 By the way, I don't believe there's any ABDL food yet because the ABDL like
01:13:06 Yeah, well because like the companies that supply like products and like merchandise for that
01:13:10 I don't think they have quite the supply chain yet to like have like refrigerateable and like
01:13:15 Just eat baby food. Yeah, I didn't I didn't particularly mean it as like like an RP thing
01:13:20 I mean it was like as a thing as a Nate thing like I want just a slurry of like protein enough for an adult
01:13:26 I'm the real ABDL
01:13:30 That's so that's my record
01:13:33 Yeah
01:13:35 Have the brain the size of a fucking mountain in this baby's body
01:13:45 Wide and
01:14:05 Cooking right the reason why I was trying to like figure out like how much more we have to say is because yeah
01:14:11 Okay, it seems like we're basically wrapped up with food, but I kind of talk about kitchens specifically
01:14:16 I don't know if we should save that for a later episode
01:14:22 We're right right right up down time I think here's the main issue for me wait
01:14:25 We we've only been going for an hour, but we've got we've got segments to get to we've got
01:14:33 I mean if we go for 50 more minutes, that's perfectly fine with me. I got no problem with that
01:14:38 The people want the kitchen rent give us the kitchen rent in all caps. Yeah 10 minute video and it has monetization on
01:14:45 Oh, true. So, you know, here's the thing about kitchens, right?
01:14:48 I have had a lot of different kinds of kitchens in my life like for you know
01:14:53 And what I found what surprised me is that this little rink eating kitchen
01:14:57 I have in my new apartment is by far the best kitchen experience. I've ever had which surprised me so a
01:15:05 Kitchen my family's kitchen in the in the house
01:15:08 We live in the nice big old house that we bought specifically because we're an older family, right?
01:15:12 The kitchen there is too fucking big. It's like a whole section of room
01:15:17 That is like a kitchen and I totally took for granted the fact that doing anything is a pain in the fucking ass
01:15:25 It's like oh shit forgot the milk
01:15:28 Yeah
01:15:30 Renting
01:15:33 Football field like honestly if I were to sprint the amount of breaths
01:15:37 I took would be accurate to the amount of fucking space. Oh shit. I forgot this spice
01:15:42 Spice, you know, it was just pain in the fucking ass and then like oh, what's up hippo?
01:15:48 Well, I was my kitchen has like um
01:15:51 And it currently is it's got like the the two sides, but then there's like an island in the middle of the room
01:15:57 Yeah, so like you don't need to go very far. You can just make a 180 to get anything
01:16:02 I don't like the islands at all
01:16:08 Like constricted and if there's something that you want that's on the opposite side of the island
01:16:12 It's basically like a fucking like Odyssey to get there and back, you know, it's a it's a small enough island for that
01:16:18 But like I mean it works well, right?
01:16:20 So my mentality towards kitchens is obviously like crafted under the
01:16:25 Situation of basically just making food for me and my fiancee so like I don't have a family yet
01:16:30 So a small kitchen is perfectly fine, right?
01:16:32 And like yeah, yeah, my family's kitchen not only was it big
01:16:35 But like it was laid out in a way where it was like almost like two or three different like sections and so yeah
01:16:41 The kitchen I'm at right now
01:16:42 It's like all in one spot and almost nothing is more than two steps away from anything else, right?
01:16:48 It's like there's the sink and then the stove is right behind it
01:16:52 So I barely even have to move anywhere
01:16:54 It's like it's like I am the fucking guy from a spirit of the way with all the arms like controlling the furnace
01:16:58 It's just like I don't even have to like move that much. It's super cool, right?
01:17:02 So I would say one of the better kitchens I'd had that I've experienced is the kitchen at the how at the bro house
01:17:09 You know their last name mr. Bro
01:17:12 It was a cool kitchen, you know, and it was laid out like in a circle
01:17:15 So like everything you didn't have to walk too far
01:17:17 The only problem with that kitchen is that everything about it was fucking dying the light. Yeah, I had a good light
01:17:24 I would have ranked it as probably the second best kitchen I've had
01:17:28 Except it goes down a couple ranks because it wasn't maintained well
01:17:30 So like it has a nice like a fluorescent light because I think fluorescent lighting is like nice and relaxing
01:17:36 Which I guess is the opposite of how it should be. I don't know what's wrong with me
01:17:39 But the light went out like a couple of times
01:17:42 So most of the time it was like we were using this shitty little like study lamp for the fucking kitchen at night
01:17:48 Which made it kind of like disable and depressing which was kind of cool
01:17:52 Especially when you're cooking with Ben, it's like yeah having like depressing cooking time. You know what I'm saying
01:17:59 But then also like the electricity around the whole house was like kind of fucked
01:18:03 So like I had bought like an electric kettle so I can make myself tea
01:18:06 So I can make myself like coffee and those little instant coffee pots, but it fucking zapped my goddamn electric kettle
01:18:12 Probably because it was a cheap $20 one
01:18:14 But the point is I spent the rest of my well those things also draw a lot of power and you're not supposed to plug them in with
01:18:19 Other shit that may have happened. It's supposed to be like it has to be on like its own circuit
01:18:22 Oh, I didn't know that I will keep that in mind because yeah
01:18:25 So basically I spent the remainder of my eight months there like just cooking it on the pot
01:18:30 And then like forgetting about it and overflows and like shade would come in be like oh you've got your
01:18:34 For your water and I'm like I remembered when I had my own water
01:18:38 My electric kettle would turn off automatically and then let's see what else like oh
01:18:43 Well then there was the dishwasher, but the dishwasher died
01:18:47 Literally the same day I moved in and it wasn't repaired everything was fucking right it died the same day
01:18:53 I moved in so I never used it and it was only repaired like a week before I moved out
01:18:57 And so the thing is is that there was water in there and the water just stayed there the whole time
01:19:03 I lived there and every couple of months. I'd be like I have to do it
01:19:07 Okay, mold it all right
01:19:09 You know I would do that like every couple months and then the coup d'et gras of this of this kitchen is that the sink clogged up
01:19:14 The the garbage disposal wait there was never a garbage disposal there
01:19:18 Oh, there was a garbage disposal there it stopped working and the stink the sink clogged up
01:19:22 And if only I had known what was coming like the stink is right right right?
01:19:26 So it just sort of built up and then like food just food ish water
01:19:30 Like just stayed there and it took like two days to drain and it just felt like total ass like Ben's crock pot
01:19:37 Malfunction was nothing compared to this like the last entire month of being in that kitchen
01:19:42 It wasn't a misfunction so much as malpractice right now practice. Yeah, yeah, I'll practice and nobody doing anything
01:19:48 Yeah, why are you standing as a bummer?
01:19:51 Because it was basically like how do you have a kitchen without a fucking sink?
01:19:56 That was the question that we all had to figure out so like I had so much processed food that month
01:20:00 Like I had lost like fucking like probably 30 to 40 pounds while I was there because I was eating
01:20:05 Water sautees and also like not eating a whole lot because I had a broken ankle twisted ankle
01:20:11 I just didn't get up much so like I just lost a lot of weight
01:20:13 But I gained a lot of that weight back right before coming back because I was eating so much processed food and just like avoiding
01:20:17 the sink the whole time so it was sort of like a
01:20:20 The whole situation in the kitchen was just sort of falling apart in us in a death spiral the same way as like everything
01:20:25 Was then so it's pretty cool. Definitely like top-keck memories. I would say
01:20:31 But I'm glad to have a normal kitchen that just does shit now, you know
01:20:35 that whole arc was like it was it was like a
01:20:38 Sort of a waking nightmare, but also like a perfectly aesthetic experience to have in like your early to mid
01:20:45 With all these dudes
01:20:56 Guys yeah, I want you all to know that while diva was telling that story
01:21:02 There was plenty of time for me to master the blade which I have now done which I have now
01:21:08 Accomplished were you in the dojo? I was I would well and well no
01:21:12 I've long since mastered the blade in in a variety focus cop killers terms
01:21:16 But this there's a little kitchen knife that was in my kitchen that I've got it's got a little sheath
01:21:21 It's got a little sheath here, and I want you all to know that I've been practicing E. Ido during this entire podcast
01:21:28 The eye the art of the quick draw you see and I have now become a full-fledged level 99 master
01:21:34 That's what I want. Yeah, now you know now, you know
01:21:38 My my kitchen is pretty good. It's kind of it's pretty like compact
01:21:41 I can easily get anything the only problem is that it's so compact and I live with so many people yeah
01:21:46 Whenever I'm cooking something they're always trying to get something out of the fridge
01:21:50 I hate that and they're all sweating and heaving and fucking vomiting all over me
01:21:55 And they've all got their bodies pressed up against me
01:21:58 It's the worst when I come downstairs during the week days and my 4-chain uncle is there because I know okay
01:22:02 Got a timer 4-chain uncle five minutes before he starts talking to me
01:22:06 So I have to run downstairs
01:22:07 I have to like get the the butter in the in the pan as fast as possible turn that shit all the way up
01:22:13 Get some fucking eggs in there, and then like always like as I'm about to put the eggs in the plate
01:22:17 He's like so I was reading this book about Ramo the other day
01:22:23 Yeah, yeah, I didn't mention that that was one of the things that drove my neatism and wanting to like like sleep
01:22:29 It weird times and like making food on my own terms to not be in the kitchen with anyone else
01:22:32 Especially when I'm a fucking angsty teenager. I'm like oh, oh
01:22:36 What's that you needed to get like a thing out of a shell that's near my torso area
01:22:42 Okay, yeah, go ahead just be
01:22:45 For you be within three feet of proximity to me. Yeah, sure. I'm not like trying to like what's hold yelling here
01:22:51 Go ahead do it. It's so awful. Oh, oh, it's like trying to draw when people around. Oh, yeah
01:22:57 Yeah, yeah, and I think I think I've mentioned this on the previous episode also like looking for something and if your mom is there
01:23:03 She's just like what are you looking for? I don't think we can find it together. No, no, I don't know
01:23:07 I'm looking for something. I can't find it. What I would do is pretend to be finding stuff constantly
01:23:16 So that I don't look like I'm having an issue so she won't ask who I'll be like
01:23:21 Open shelf. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, open up drawer. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah
01:23:28 I think what I actually did was I just was so weird that she was just too scared to approach me
01:23:32 But you know, I got the results I needed right she didn't fucking ask me what I'm looking for right
01:23:37 That's practicality
01:23:40 The same thing when I was living at home or like half the time like I want to cook
01:23:44 But I so didn't want to be around anywhere where anyone would look at me or talk to me
01:23:48 Yeah, I just wouldn't do exactly
01:23:50 Wait till everyone else is gone. Yeah, you will you avoid your parents? Oh, yeah
01:23:54 Yeah, I don't want my parents to be like, oh what inspired you to cook today. Are you not or you're not gonna cook ever again?
01:24:00 Yeah
01:24:05 Even more the kind of oh what you doing like did you just told me that you would go around into the backyard to go
01:24:11 Into the garage to then come out the garage door when you come home
01:24:14 So that it looks like instead of coming home you just came from the garage so that your dad wouldn't ask where you go when you were out
01:24:21 Which is I would right. Yeah, that's me even though. It's not like I was out doing anything
01:24:26 I just have I just I would have the intense anxiety that anyone would talk to me and because I get so like
01:24:32 The I used to be very frustrated when I was trapped at home. Right. It just like when I'm angry
01:24:38 I know if I if anyone tries to ask me something
01:24:41 I'm just gonna like give a every action that they're not like
01:24:44 So I just like want to avoid all back in this like one like period of
01:24:49 Teenagernessness where before I had to work, but when I had to clean the dishes
01:24:52 I would just be like, oh, I'm not doing them in right after breakfast. No, not doing them after dinner. No, I do them at 3
01:25:00 Fucking a.m. So like it was in the house where the kitchen was far away enough, right?
01:25:03 So I would just like ah, it's 3 a.m. Fucking perfect, right?
01:25:08 And I would just like put on podcasts or whatever and it's like, ah
01:25:12 Everyone's asleep. I'm completely alone. I could watch all the dishes. It was beautiful
01:25:16 I think that was probably why I like washing dishes to this day is because that was a good experience
01:25:21 Just being completely alone. No one's gonna talk to me the whole the whole like thing with not being like wanting to start a
01:25:28 Conversation with somebody but so you avoid like the places where people would
01:25:33 Likely be is probably the reason I to my brothers always just start like if we see each other
01:25:39 We say nothing we say like a weird
01:25:44 Acknowledge like each other's presence without having to say so
01:25:49 How you do it like we avoid that by being fucking strange
01:25:53 That's what me and shade do every time we see each other me and shade just go like
01:26:00 Me and my brother know exactly the kind of things that makes us uncomfortable
01:26:03 So like if something awkward happens one basically the way we do it is we go, huh?
01:26:08 I can't believe you just did that like well like like if something wrong happens
01:26:11 You'll imagine like what is the worst possible thing someone could say to judge you and we'll just like say that judging thing like jokingly
01:26:18 And it like relieves the tension right and then like I can't stop doing it with other people
01:26:22 So people think I'm being super fucking rude right or like if something awkward is happening instead of trying to like be like
01:26:27 Oh, man, are you okay? Because it's like that pisses me off when someone says that so my brother's always just like ha suffer, right?
01:26:35 I just sort of like do that to other people and other people are like what the fuck you like you make it fun to me
01:26:39 I'm like no, I'm just I'm just I'm just telling you to suffer
01:26:44 It's always awful when you're like downstairs and you're doing something and then and then your parents begin with so
01:26:52 And you know are all right. What's the lie? I have to say this time
01:26:56 What do I have to fit what I have to stretch the shoes to make sure that they do not ask any more questions?
01:27:01 This is what concentration camp. I have to make sure that they don't ask any more questions after this
01:27:07 Yeah, what concentration camp can I be shipped off to to avoid this kind?
01:27:10 Yeah, I would do anything to avoid
01:27:15 The way I sort of dealt with that yeah, is that I try to like have answers to questions
01:27:20 They're likely to say and say them before they can so that it so that it feels like I'm being yeah
01:27:27 And then they don't feel the need to ask that much
01:27:30 I think we're kind of cannibalizing the future PCP episode about like dealing with talking to your parents
01:27:35 But yeah, I do want to say like since we've already just cannibalized most of it
01:27:38 Like it was a weird like I think the most coming-of-age thing about me was deciding to stop watching TV with my family
01:27:44 Because they wouldn't stop watching fucking cop drama shows and it's been fucking 14 years since and then they still haven't stopped
01:27:50 So I was just like I'm done. I don't want to keep watching movies with you
01:27:54 I don't want to keep watching TV and my dad was legit offended because like for like the modern 21st century man
01:27:59 There's no more wars to fight no more fucking boars to stab no more fucking minorities to fucking
01:28:05 Like kill right there's no more manly things to do well
01:28:08 We just don't have the excuse anymore
01:28:11 Except to fucking watch TV
01:28:13 It's the only thing dads have left that and grilling but like it's true
01:28:17 And so when you stop watching TV because your parents have shit taste in shit
01:28:21 And you just want to be on the internet where everything is much better
01:28:23 My dad was just like why why aren't you watching this movie?
01:28:27 And he finally like two movies in a row that I refuse to watch he was just like fine. Don't watch the movie
01:28:33 I mean, he
01:28:37 Once he got the message he he never bugged me about it again like my parents they they fucking understood that
01:28:43 I'm an anti-social recluse and they got it eventually, but like it was really funny and I didn't you know being 14 at the time
01:28:49 I didn't have the emotional depth to understand what I was doing the way I do now
01:28:52 It's probably like like write him a fucking apology actually
01:28:55 Even though
01:28:59 What say is a real millennial thing
01:29:01 I don't know if any of you will get this and and if someone were to say this to me
01:29:05 I would make fun of them as well
01:29:06 But I know it is true and I have noticed it in my life
01:29:10 Whenever I'm like in the car or something and I have my headphones in and my family tries to talk to me
01:29:17 I just cannot like I cannot express the deep like I don't describe it
01:29:22 Like guttural like primal feeling of rage that I get I have headphones in I don't want to talk to you
01:29:29 Leave me alone. I'm looking out the window and blasting music. I obviously don't want to talk to you about my day
01:29:37 Please stop mom, please. Yes
01:29:40 Yes
01:29:41 Well, that's one of the joys of moving out and getting away from your parents
01:29:45 Yeah, you get to mellow out and not be pissed off at them like 100 yeah
01:29:49 For absolutely no yeah, yeah, there's like no
01:29:52 No, yeah, I can't wait
01:29:53 I can't wait to like come go back home to my family and visit them and be like cook with them
01:29:57 You're like, oh you want to like get a thing in front of my shelf three feet around right like around my general area
01:30:02 I'll be totally fine with it and I'm just gonna be like oh
01:30:07 I can be around human beings and I don't feel like a wound up stress ball ready to pop brilliant
01:30:14 Indeed exactly. All right. It is really fun the end
01:30:20 Yeah, and a munchie. No cooking is not fun. It's over is what cooking. Oh, yeah
01:30:25 Well, what do you say this slams head into grill and sizzled to perfect
01:30:32 Now that's what I call alchemy. Oh
01:30:36 Only a one in a billion. He's very rare
01:30:39 Hey, well team. I will you so that's the end of our of our main show I mean course
01:30:47 Damn, yeah, it's let's let's let's prepare this one. Well a base
01:30:53 Good. All right. Here's what we're doing team. Here's what we're doing. We're not going straight into questions
01:30:58 We're doing a couple of things where we're trying out some new shit, but here's the first of all so this PCP theme
01:31:05 Contest thing is still happening and you've all been a colossal failure
01:31:14 Because we have proof that that's not true because we do still have that one submission that I mentioned last episode
01:31:20 So we're gonna play it right fucking now on the show. We're all gonna listen to it
01:31:24 I wait from it's from our boy AJ Shoup and if you if you think you can do better
01:31:30 Yeah, invite you to try you fucking coward indeed hashtag
01:31:35 PCP theme send it to us on Twitter or if in the discord if you're the patreon, that's fine, too
01:31:40 But send us this shit cuz we're this is not a failure. This is real
01:31:45 This is for real. I swear dad. I'm I'm actually able to pay my bills with my internet career. It's not a joke
01:31:51 It's not fake. I don't have to live off food stamps. I actually will make something on my life. I'm not desperate
01:31:56 I'm not a failure. Munchie play the song
01:32:00 Play the song
01:32:04 You are a robot Nazi techno state Jesus Christ. Okay. All right. Here we go
01:32:09 I'm just gonna be work to death day-in day-out without an extra pay to be the robot slave holder here. That's right. Here we go
01:32:17 Yeah
01:32:30 Oh
01:32:50 What happened in rad con 17 like montage, you know what I mean?
01:32:55 AJ that was excellent. Yes, pretty much like that a lot. Yeah, and it's kind of
01:33:02 I don't think it has the right tone to be an OP though
01:33:05 We could we could shorten it to make it like a very
01:33:10 Tone of it doesn't like make me doesn't feel opening to me
01:33:14 Let me let me can I can I share an anecdote with you guys about the creator of that of that jingle?
01:33:19 Yeah, please so the other day so the other I was making a new discord and I got carried away
01:33:25 Invited pretty much everyone. Yeah, everyone on my friends list into this new discord, right?
01:33:30 And it became you know it wrap it spiraled out of control and I had no idea or you continue your anecdote
01:33:35 I have an anecdote about your anecdote
01:33:38 Okay, Ben is a recluse
01:33:41 Ben is not someone who goes out of his way to like talk to people at least from my perspective
01:33:46 He does not like initiate conversations about anything that aren't awful
01:33:52 When I get like a
01:33:55 Discord link like a link from him out of the blue like like just just you know one damn on my phone
01:34:00 And there it is a discord link and then he sends the same link again two times in a row not saying anything
01:34:07 Yeah, I was too soon. He's like hacked or like so he's like like like some sort of sleeper agent for the Russian government
01:34:15 My mind and and now he seems sort of like Islam bomber or this is like some sort of like suicide stunt
01:34:21 Where he just needs to be doing this and he's in a giant like group call and sick. All right guys
01:34:25 This is it. I'm going to kill myself live on air
01:34:31 I get blood to my kick started to kill myself
01:34:34 Shock of anxiety that runs up my spine when Ben sends me a link to something without saying anything that that's how I feel
01:34:40 When I talk to you, I mean it was funny that both you and mage were like really concerned and I was just like well
01:34:44 Of course Ben would do this. Like of course, you just like randomly make a chat and then like not explain it at all
01:34:50 Okay, so so go on. Okay, so I said so I invited everyone on my friend
01:34:54 I just like spammed invites to basically everyone. Yeah
01:34:56 Um, it everyone jumped in it it spiraled out of control. I had no idea what was going on
01:35:01 And I was like, you know what nevermind so I didn't delete it
01:35:04 But I just left it for a while a couple hours later. I
01:35:08 Well like later that day at my discord account got deleted or got deactivated because of spamming because I had
01:35:14 Done this it got reinstated today. So it's all fine
01:35:16 But for a while I was dead and I and I couldn't keep up with what was going on in there a couple hours after I made it
01:35:22 I just happened to see AJ Schoop say mod me. So I did then my then my account gets gets deactivated
01:35:28 Two days later, it gets back. I come back in I look and now I see that what I think I created the there's like a
01:35:36 Space station like aliens like roleplay like bot thing going on like there's like there's like commands and stuff
01:35:43 It's like a mini endless war, but like set in space or something
01:35:46 Well, you are you are the the god in the religion of deism like you just created it then left and then like came
01:35:53 Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't know what's going on there anymore. So is AJ responsible for this?
01:36:00 I mean, I can only assume so I don't know
01:36:03 Probably well sounds like there's two bends in the chat
01:36:08 Huh?
01:36:09 Is this why there's two bends currently in this chair
01:36:12 Well, I'm the other one I made be when the other one my real account was was temporarily deactivated
01:36:18 He will be dealt with that that road. Yeah, he will be sent to the school. I lost all of your slime
01:36:23 How fucked up would that be?
01:36:25 Well, I would have just had crack transferred or something. Yeah, it would have been fine
01:36:29 It would have been fine. That's like as far as rowdy fuckers
01:36:32 That's when you die in a Minecraft server and then you say your friend
01:36:36 Like TPed me and your friends like no you have to walk back here. Those are the rules. I can't I can't cheat. It's like
01:36:45 No moving on
01:36:47 Okay, well, I mean that's our one submission right now was pretty fucking tight AJ nice job
01:36:52 But we want more people we want fucking more. I demand more send more to us
01:36:57 We want to play each one of these as the theme one after the other before the show
01:37:01 It kind of like my way
01:37:04 Like a whole album a whole album of PCP themes before the show every single
01:37:09 Yeah, that'd be funny. I mean, yeah, just send more people you've heard it now. They're real
01:37:14 We'll play them on the fucking show. So send them to us send them immediately
01:37:19 Saying things on the show
01:37:21 I think we're gonna start like reading comments or at least responding to general sentiments of comments on the show as well
01:37:28 So if you want to be read or have the general sentiment of what you're implying or saying be
01:37:33 Acknowledged by us
01:37:37 I just imagine this the starry-eyed fans with their poster of us on their wall
01:37:41 We like I can't wait. I dream for one day the general sentiment of what I think of their content to be
01:37:50 But I mean but on that front other other new thing
01:37:53 That'd be I don't know if this is what you were building to but we're talking to we want voicemails people
01:37:58 Yes, we want voicemail. So okay, here you go
01:38:01 Hashtag PCP voicemail. You got a couple options. Send us
01:38:05 YouTube videos or links to SoundCloud. We tried fucking Vokeroo. It doesn't work. So we can't do it that easily
01:38:12 So it's got one of those don't make don't make a visual for YouTube video
01:38:16 We're not gonna watch that. It's not what it's about. It's not what it's about
01:38:19 And and to anyone to anyone who's listened to those podcasts
01:38:23 Please do not simply import the biggest problem versus style of humor into the voicemails that you do come up with your own thing
01:38:31 Yeah, it's funny. I don't care. Well, there's this very specific style
01:38:34 I feel like some people might think it's just the default for voicemails. It is not it's just that universe
01:38:39 We have our own sense of humor. We were original around here. We don't want to get copyrighted
01:38:43 I
01:38:47 Happen to fancy myself quite derivative
01:38:50 I fancy myself quite the sketch charm if you will but I don't think I've said a funny thing in my life
01:38:58 So hashtag PCB voicemail begin immediately and and we will we're gonna review them
01:39:04 So you don't think you're gonna slip a fast one past us, but yeah, send them on Twitter
01:39:08 That's like the easiest way
01:39:09 Hashtag PCB voicemail use it the next voicemail is hey guys. It's me
01:39:14 I'm really glad you guys have endorsed me bombing the United States government
01:39:24 I guess we did I guess we did by playing this on our show. I guess reliable. Well
01:39:29 Okay, so that's happening keep more themes PCB theme hashtag PCB theme Twitter send us that shit
01:39:39 We're looking for it. Hashtag PCB voicemail. We're gonna be looking for that shit, too
01:39:44 That aside it's time for the fan art
01:39:48 Section of our program here fan art corner over the fan art corner hashtag PCP fan art PCP has such a visceral and
01:39:55 Voluptuous ass it is back heavy and it is like super bloated now. That's what this entire show is gonna be
01:40:02 Yeah, yeah, it's good. It's gonna be two hours of topic. It's gonna be eight hours, right?
01:40:08 Maybe at some point if it gets bloated enough
01:40:10 We'll just have like a like a bi monthly like fan response video. You know what I mean? Wait a minute wait a minute
01:40:16 PCP mail time
01:40:18 Guys, I there actually is another entrance in the PCP theme thing already
01:40:25 No, I mean this is from May 29th. I'd like I just searched for hashtag PCB fan art and this came up
01:40:32 Yeah, three days. Okay, let me let me get the fucking link. All right, hang on. Hang on. I will play it in the thing
01:40:37 How the fuck does this got no work? Please fucking? Okay? Okay. Here it goes. Let me fucking
01:40:44 Do the thing. I'm doing the thing. I gotta push the button
01:40:48 Play this go punk bitch motherfucker
01:41:02 I have AIDS
01:41:17 I
01:41:35 It's the PCP bitch
01:41:39 You know what I think that was maybe a little better as like an ending song I mean, yeah, the slower
01:41:45 Yeah, yeah, okay, I think I think the the do-do-do-do-do-do by the way be like while we're talking like and welcome to the procrastinators while
01:41:53 It's playing. I think that's so sorry. I forgot to say that is from at Peter John death pay PJD. There you go
01:41:59 So I can speak only for myself of the cheat sheet to getting a thumbs up on
01:42:06 OP
01:42:07 Entrance for me at least is what's in an OP Davoo. Tell us what's in an OP?
01:42:15 To bring Jeff back to help us judge
01:42:19 Join Jeff join that that server that got me fucking booted from this
01:42:27 OP reference I was thinking oh, how would I impersonate Jeff? I guess yell and have a lisp. Oh shit
01:42:32 That's already me. Anyway, so the way to get a thumbs up from me on your entry is focus on like really, you know
01:42:39 pour yourself over tone and
01:42:42 Catchy melody and like especially tone like what's the tone of an OP?
01:42:46 What's gonna like make you feel like yeah listening to an episode right now because honestly
01:42:50 I think there's very few podcast openings that make me that that feel right to me and don't put an emphasis possibly avoid
01:42:57 Like showing off how many random things what the PCP you know in your audio clips
01:43:01 Like I don't care how actually like dedicated level of a fan
01:43:05 You are of the group for as far as I'm concerned someone who just like has the right musical sensibility
01:43:10 But like has listened to like five episodes could very well be the one to decide to make the perfect theme
01:43:16 Sure, sure. I mean, yeah, I like the the little clips of stuff in there
01:43:22 But I guess I would say for a theme song
01:43:25 I mean, it's possible that one of us could fucking die or whatever
01:43:29 If that person was in the theme, I'm just saying I'm just saying right it's complicated
01:43:35 I'd go without it if I would I would almost never
01:43:38 Give the green light on a theme that has any audio clips like of us at all because I just I don't know
01:43:44 But I just agree. I think it's cool. I would never like I like the audio
01:43:52 Definitely almost certainly never hit the upvote on a theme that has like very clean
01:43:57 Not even altered audio clips because then it's like what am I already listening to the podcast?
01:44:01 It's just kind of like weird and dissonant for me
01:44:04 I mean that opening I think is like starting with Digi like come on Digi's fucking dead. We all know this. He's out
01:44:09 He's gone. This is just it's just weird to get
01:44:12 Voice in a podcast thing. I'm not into it
01:44:15 If you could get the voice of the PCP guy if you could interview PCP guy and get him to do the intro somehow
01:44:21 You know enter the anime land and we'll actually know
01:44:26 Does this back come on have an anime
01:44:28 Let's spend the the next eight minutes coming up with funny voices for the PCP guy
01:44:34 Hi guys, it's me the PCP guy
01:44:36 Oh, that's it. No, we can't do it. We got one and done baby. There we go
01:44:42 All right settled settled well true voice actor
01:44:46 So, I mean that was it so okay, so those two are the contenders right now
01:44:50 I gotta say between these two I'm leaning towards AJ because I just like the upbeat
01:44:54 Yeah, I really like both. I think for an opening. I think AJ's is more of an opening
01:45:00 I mean fuck why don't we we can fucking use the first one to open and the second one for closet?
01:45:04 We can use it all we can have it all
01:45:06 Yeah, rid of the original fucking son. We can get rid of the original. It doesn't have to be gone forever
01:45:11 I mean we could see I mean it's all it's like a million years old now
01:45:14 I mean, I would yeah that that first one that we listened to I would use that as the ED sometimes
01:45:20 That's as far as I would go
01:45:22 Well, there you go. There you go. Well, hey, we keep sending people where this this whole thing we're figuring out
01:45:27 We're role-playing sexually. We're gonna keep at it. Hey Victor. I bet you're glad that you stayed for this
01:45:34 I'm sure you have a lot to say and I'm glad I think you're bet that you're glad you're here. I
01:45:38 I am playing Fire Emblem Warriors
01:45:40 And listening to the PCP, which I would do anyway
01:45:45 Did you fucking hear the rumblings?
01:45:47 Did you hear the ground fucking shake with this drop cuz I'm about to tell you and the audience all about the greatest game of the
01:45:55 Fucking century is out right now. Jurassic World alive
01:46:03 Are you fucking serious? I'm coming in my pants. I know I'm the next all summer long
01:46:09 I'm gonna be running up and down the street pots and pans banging on my neighbors doors
01:46:15 Screaming for their first board and getting them to come out and play Jurassic World alive with me. I'm gonna be catching dinos
01:46:22 I'm gonna be running from the cops
01:46:24 And I'm gonna get that sweet ass
01:46:27 Sores up on my sore ass and it's gonna be sick as hell
01:46:32 Nice. I like the idea that playing a dinosaur catching game
01:46:36 Mean like like in the game. You also have to avoid the police
01:46:40 Oh, like oh, yeah, like a need for speed a cops and dinosaurs are dying
01:46:46 I'm actually more dangerous than a t-rex. This is the police commission
01:46:50 This is all real viewers click the show notes for it for some hot screen caps
01:46:54 Oh Jurassic World alive. It is fucking out and you better believe after the pockets. I'm gonna be running
01:47:01 Sprinting down the street cash in those fucking dino
01:47:05 It doesn't even look not it doesn't even look bad. I want to play. Oh, it's it's like a Pokemon go sword thing
01:47:17 It's a ripoff of Jurassic World alive
01:47:21 You know, this is this is very different
01:47:24 I see this is the real shit. This is like Victor you like you like look how Florida smells
01:47:31 You're like chlorine

01:47:53 You know what there's infinite fan art of
01:47:57 Endless war every day is a fucking torrent
01:48:05 Day in day out. We're in the family because we care about them. It's a it's a vicious cycle
01:48:10 It's a vicious cycle. We have the lore people draw the lore people expand the lore through their art and then that becomes new lore
01:48:16 I am so fucking grateful for every single fan artist for the right. Okay, I'm going through
01:48:23 I'm going through the archives right now saving every fucking piece that has not been archa. I'm going to I'm gonna be fucking putting them up in the
01:48:31 Excellent

01:49:13 Yeah, of course kind of like kind of like we wasted our lives making it in the first place. Yeah
01:49:17 Yeah, I mean ways exactly shout to no be retro pk and
01:49:22 Oh god

01:49:28 There is one submission and it is glorious by Simsie. This is a 100% accurate depiction of me
01:49:36 There is there he is
01:49:43 That it's basically a chibi baka it's pretty close. What is this pencil get out of here pencil we've
01:49:49 Digital only
01:49:53 It's not it's a really good drawing that is
01:50:02 He's got a picture here he should trace over this and computerize it and fucking digital art if I
01:50:10 Digital or otherwise
01:50:12 It's very solid to be in ASCII. They should be in ASCII
01:50:17 And when you put it into a coder it will actually play a video game the ASCII is actually code
01:50:23 You know you need it needs to have a fucking scan code so that you can scan and get best guy ever in Skylanders
01:50:30 Right, that's what this is
01:50:33 Fucking PCP amiibo

01:50:44 Like the the draw cast stuff
01:50:46 I don't know if now here's like the right place to show them cuz like we get a lot of still fan
01:50:51 I get a lot of dumps of draw cast stuff whenever a new draw cast comes out though
01:50:54 So like to show all of them in a PCP is
01:50:57 I'll tell you this yeah, we will show them on the draw cast themselves about that you fuck that's a good idea
01:51:03 That's a good idea silly disheveled popper. Yeah, good. Good. Thank you. All right. Well, that's literally it for today
01:51:10 There was one sketch
01:51:12 Guys hashtag PCP fan art on the Twitter. I know you're drawing it. I know you're drawing it
01:51:18 You're being a little shy you're being a little timid you don't want to show it because you want to get bullied by me
01:51:22 It's almost like as soon as we asked for it. It dried up. I mean to a degree to a degree
01:51:27 Yeah, cuz then they knew that we would actually be talking about it
01:51:31 Cuz then they knew you would actually be commenting on it and like and they know that like Ben might comment on it
01:51:35 And like Ben is like I mean I am also like most of us are pretty fucking like straightforward
01:51:41 Maybe like this sucks or like here's why you suck or here's what sucks about you. Are you saying that they're intimidated of me?
01:51:47 Yeah
01:51:51 I mean we started doing that we started doing the segment because we were getting like a lot
01:51:55 We're literally on D platforming them by giving them a platform by showing their shit
01:52:03 So you got you got nothing to lose people you got nothing to lose and everything to gain so
01:52:08 Like fucking fucking nexus just made like a bunch of like best guy ever art like well
01:52:13 He was doing is like me a math of a style challenge and it's fucking incredible
01:52:16 It's just like the animation he did like holy shit. It's because people aren't connecting with the podcast to connect

01:54:59 It's a much better name. It's a money. It's a monument to my virginity
01:55:04 I treasure dearly
01:55:06 And all the buffalo burger there is pepper jack bacon and then you get witch's your sauce and a one-sauce and you drown it in it
01:55:14 Right last I heard this was the munchie, but what all right? I guess things change. Okay, there you go. There you go
01:55:21 um, I
01:55:23 Other is there any other iconic me? I mean the poor boy
01:55:26 I mean
01:55:28 No, the the Ben saint is
01:55:32 whole milk ice
01:55:34 juice from a from a bottle of
01:55:38 Maraschino cherries a couple of the cherries themselves and ice do you blend that you just mix it okay?
01:55:45 Okay, I mean you leave the cherries whole the chair. Yeah, okay
01:55:48 And the well, there's also the Ben my real name, which I don't even know why I'm not bothering to say because it's not even a secret
01:55:54 Whatever, it's a lame name anyway, but yeah, there's the real Ben or the fake Ben whatever you choose to believe
01:55:59 Who is the real Ben?
01:56:05 Hot coffee and chocolate protein powder
01:56:11 I had that decadent to even like like acknowledge as true because it will just kill you
01:56:17 Sometimes whatever I want to make a bin saying instead of having milk. I'll have orange juice. What?
01:56:22 But dude, but dude you been yeah, I actually
01:56:25 Why is that you they're both?
01:56:27 How is that right?
01:56:29 No, that's like the city. Yeah, I think it's with the cherry shit is it just sounds gross
01:56:35 I mean, there's no milk. So it's not gonna orange in it. Do you put the orange in in addition to the cherry or instead of the cherry?
01:56:41 No, right? No, no, no, no, no, yeah, both but there is no milk
01:56:44 There's no milk, but I gotta say I don't know if I've ever heard well, then that's just juicy fucking
01:56:49 Ever heard you describe the bin sainte before but I actually recently just like a couple weeks ago
01:56:53 Just like thought to put some chocolate protein powder in my coffee. So that's that's kind of
01:57:01 Dude one time I was elevated through the ceiling and I had to repair my roof because of this energy drink
01:57:07 I drank one time I
01:57:09 It was okay
01:57:10 I got a scoop of chocolate ice cream then I put in milk and like chocolate syrup
01:57:16 I mixed that around then I put in two like Starbucks a double shot energy drinks into it
01:57:21 I swirled it all around Jesus and I drank it and I could not stop I could not stop my wife asked me to stop
01:57:28 I
01:57:30 Um, I guess I guess that a fried Oreo with a with a Swedish fish flavored Oreo is is might be a Ben a Ben recipe
01:57:40 Uh
01:57:41 So yeah, I guess so I guess that would be called the red the red
01:57:46 Let me well that red stain
01:57:49 Do you remember my suit my Swedish fish addiction at anime expo? I do I do there was pictures of that and what not
01:57:57 Well, here's here's another recipe that Ben cooked up
01:57:59 I want to find what's another name for a recipe that would be Ben named
01:58:02 What can we give one real quick like the the Ben Jaman sandwich the this isn't well, okay
01:58:09 It's the I'm gonna call it a I'm gonna call it a
01:58:11 Because I'm gonna call it a so ugly this is a so ugly and what it is. It is it is you take you know your your plastic case of
01:58:21 Gummy vitamins and you melt it down into one solid puck. Yes, that's so
01:58:26 Congealed gummy vitamins. Yeah, it's not even bad. It tastes a little metallic tastes a little like blood
01:58:32 But it's quite delicious. Yeah, that's just your own mouth bleeding, but go on munchie
01:58:36 I have a recipe called Ben's soul and you get nacho cheese and beer you put in a crock pot and wait
01:58:46 And
01:58:49 You know, you know, you know it's soul eater how like everyone's soul looks like a certain thing and you can like see it like
01:58:54 That's what Ben's soul looks like looks like that goopy film that crusted dry acidic death Valley
01:59:01 You know cheese and beer melted crock pot
01:59:08 Victor can you hear us? I'm trying to connect I can't can you still hear me? Yeah, now I can hear you now
01:59:14 Yeah, okay. Well, did you have an answer the question from our boy about why you never wear a shirt or why you hate shirt so much
01:59:21 I didn't I didn't okay, so it was no you may ask why does Vic hate wearing shirts so much
01:59:26 That was a full question because shirts are hot and they fucking suck
01:59:30 Clothes are stupid, and I wouldn't wear any clothes if I didn't have to I
01:59:34 We're in a shirt right now
01:59:36 I'm so against this. I feel the exact opposite way where whenever I'm forced to be naked to take a shower
01:59:43 It's most uncomfortable like unpleasant experience of my entire life. I hate hat like I feel just defenseless
01:59:49 I feel like if some animal were to come up and fight me I would lose if I don't have my
01:59:53 I feel similarly it gives me like plus one defense. Why would I give that up? You know? Yeah? Yeah?
02:00:00 Being naked is not like fun. It's overrated. I don't yeah
02:00:04 I don't love being shirtless around other people sure sure fucking looking at like I hate attention
02:00:15 It's the same fucking thing ever and I hate all the comments about about me and and the fact that I'm sure yeah
02:00:21 Yeah, I also hate wearing a shirt because it makes me itchy and hot, and I'm always itchy and hot
02:00:26 Understandable throw them on but I'm more used to wearing no shirt than I am wearing a shirt
02:00:34 Actually, yeah, Victor you being around you with your shirt off is actually what motivated me to like stop fucking gay
02:00:40 So that I can become like as unbellied as possible so that I can one day like just not wear
02:00:46 Unbellied to say Finn right well
02:00:49 I didn't quite work because I wasn't losing weight the correct way
02:00:51 So I'm just like I want to fucking lose weight and like be somewhat fit just so that I can
02:00:57 Not have a shirt around a higher percentage of society
02:01:01 It would be fantastic, but even Victor here who's who's
02:01:05 Significantly fit still doesn't generally not wear a shirt unless he's like at home
02:01:11 I'm not nervous around people
02:01:13 I'm just
02:01:19 In here when I said I just make people uncomfortable and don't give a shit
02:01:27 Like I don't mind not wearing a shirt around people
02:01:32 But it obviously depends on who it is when it's a hot day
02:01:35 I'll usually just like wear like a Hawaiian shirt open and that and no shoes and that that that feels good
02:01:42 I like it. I like no shoes. No socks or shoes. Oh, yeah
02:01:46 I'm coming right from California and wearing shirt is just like what to do. Yes sandals
02:01:51 I'm wearing flip-flops every day when I come home. It's a ritual. I take off my shoes
02:01:55 Take off my socks. That is ultimate pleasure that put on my sandals, and it feels great
02:01:59 I also take off my pants, but I'm yeah, and the reason I feel up there
02:02:03 The reason I feel like wearing no shoes is okay
02:02:05 But like being naked is kind of you feel defenseless is because like when
02:02:10 When you walk on your feet a lot
02:02:13 They get tough they get the skin gets feels tough and you stop like yeah, you know if you walk on rocks a
02:02:20 lot then you
02:02:22 Will not get hurt get hurt so much with with don't wear a shirt a lot
02:02:26 Then you toughen up like your skin and you become like you become like the thing
02:02:31 You're like made of cement around your whole body, you know
02:02:33 I'm not saying that that's what's happened what will happen
02:02:36 But if you have like toned muscles, and you feel like your skin is tough
02:02:40 It will feel you will feel like you already have like padded armor on yeah, okay rather rather than be like a weak like easily
02:02:47 Pissable
02:02:49 I feel like also it like even though the feet your feet and like legs are probably the limbs you're like maybe
02:02:55 Least in control they feel the most powerful, and they feel like the things that you could most easily attack someone with
02:03:00 So you put your legs. They're weird. Yeah, your legs are your most powerful weapon
02:03:05 That's true except for your cock of course can't beat the cock, you know
02:03:09 Well, that has that's why it's physical and psychological
02:03:13 She was single combo. It's that's true. Look out everyone duck down here comes a question from line slimes
02:03:19 What would you change about your upbringing literally get castrated and that is not a joke
02:03:25 But your testosterone levels though, they'll fucking plug
02:03:30 Okay, if I just be a barra and have no dick that would be my ultimate dream, okay, okay here
02:03:38 You know what I would have had more money
02:03:42 Okay, what if but why what if you could you could get your dick chopped off and keep your balls having more money well
02:03:49 Everything easier and you don't have to do. Yeah, I disagree money
02:03:54 Everything is easy. I fundamentally disagree. No libido and just like it have enough you in phase me
02:03:59 That would have made my life so much better. I would have
02:04:02 Yes, having no libido. I think is what he's going for I would have want to have been poorer and
02:04:07 Live in a more packed environment, so I could have interacted with more people so that I could
02:04:14 Become like a like like like fucking like Steve Jobs his dad was like a Syrian immigrant and
02:04:20 Like I don't think they were very well off at the time, you know, I haven't fucking looked at the point
02:04:25 The what I'm just reading here is a tale of like when you're poor and it makes you scrappy and resourceful
02:04:31 And you become a man faster
02:04:33 It's not a fucking rule it just it is the thing about that is like when it when it works out
02:04:38 It is such an unexpected thing that it becomes an event that people talk exactly exactly hippo
02:04:44 Yeah, that's what I was gonna say like like it doesn't actually do that like sometimes
02:04:48 Someone can become scrappy and escape from poverty, but that's the exception and like it's notable because it doesn't happen
02:04:54 Right poor and being underprivileged is not like yeah a thing that like separates the week from the yeah
02:04:59 It is a thing that makes people weak and disenfranchises them
02:05:03 This is yet another like future podcast
02:05:05 I'm just gonna like gut right now, which is the whole mentality of things going wrong can then be good
02:05:11 It's like no things being good is good now. I know challenges. No fuck you guys
02:05:16 You don't know what you're talking about
02:05:19 You're right
02:05:24 It's when people try to rationalize pain and suffering by saying what makes me stronger
02:05:28 Here's the thing though if you don't have to actually shit if you don't have if you don't have to have pain
02:05:33 We're at least not as much right you can still choose to get strong through your own will now
02:05:40 I know there's plenty of people who will end up in why are you rich people so much more depressed
02:05:44 It's because they have too much shit. I don't work hard. I don't trust any statistics that say as much and I do
02:05:52 I'm pre-emptively saying I don't know stats on that and like so here's the thing right
02:05:57 I got some stats. Let's say there are like there is a scenario where people probably get diagnosed with depression more often because
02:06:04 I have more free time to put this way
02:06:06 There's four scenarios right there's people who suffer and as a result they keep suffering and they become shitty people because they've
02:06:12 Never had time to grow then there's people who suffer and then make something of themselves become excellent individuals. They they emerge from that
02:06:21 That disparity from that difficulty and they become great then there's people who don't have to suffer and then don't become particularly
02:06:28 Remarkable people at all. That's the third scenario the last one is people who don't have to suffer and become great
02:06:35 Which do exist not every billionaire walking the earth today in their mega yachts was actually poor like you know like Bill Gates was not poor
02:06:44 Right he wasn't like a billionaire
02:06:45 But he had like access to a fucking computer way before most people did and he made even more out of it
02:06:51 That is the ideal scenario that you can actually become good because you want to become good because like what I see for most people most of my
02:06:58 peers the the classic stereotypical millennials who don't know what to do with themselves generally in
02:07:04 Proportion to how fucking like stunted they've been or hurt. They've been by shit not by how much stuff they have
02:07:10 All right, this does completely irrelevant because it doesn't matter. No one's asking you why you would be less privileged
02:07:16 It's a question for each of us individually. I answered my fucking question here by saying that like
02:07:25 Well, you don't know this is totally not irrelevant. You don't know my fucking life the point is I
02:07:31 Grew up with you. Yeah, I'm talking to DeVue
02:07:34 The point is when I got to be a certain age
02:07:37 I figured out that I needed to work hard to get stuff
02:07:39 I just didn't fucking figure that out until I was like 23 and if I had figured that out sooner
02:07:45 I think my life would have been better. That's my whole point. So
02:07:52 Yeah, that's true like you need like a you need like a push you see because I don't think my family's as well off as yours
02:07:57 Is is I had that I had basically the exact same thing and it was a push when I was like 18
02:08:02 So, yeah, that was very advantageous to me. You're right. Well, that's what I'm saying
02:08:06 Maybe that's my only point. Maybe you're fucking right
02:08:08 Maybe I have the same kind of mentality as you I had to just get pushed
02:08:11 It was just a little bit of a nudge and then I was fine from then on out
02:08:14 I think everybody needs to get well a lot of people the pushing doesn't work the pushing becomes shoving and then it becomes
02:08:19 struggling well
02:08:20 It's it depends on the type like if you always have a good like if you if your parents say you should get a job
02:08:25 We're gonna get you out
02:08:26 I think if you're the type that's gonna work hard and realize that you need to work hard to achieve your goals
02:08:30 I think yeah, but that will that's gonna happen pretty much. Yeah
02:08:34 You're saying that it's all having more money is just gonna make you better poise to accomplish
02:08:38 Well, but you're just saying that it's all nature and no nurture and I don't agree with that
02:08:43 I don't think it's all nature. Okay. All right. All right. So I think what would probably because it's hard for me to say like
02:08:48 How would it change by upbringing without it being a change to like individual people or like I'm trying to think of like
02:08:54 Living situations and not people situations because there's a million ways I could think about people and interactions
02:08:59 But like life style wise. Yeah, I would say if I were to like go use a time machine to turn me into more of a fucking art
02:09:08 Monster I would say that my family somehow becomes extremely dead broke around the time
02:09:14 I'm like 12 so the point that I have to like get a part-time job when I'm 14
02:09:18 And therefore I would get the same push I got but like four years earlier
02:09:21 Yeah, and that would give me a little bit of an advantage
02:09:23 Otherwise, I can't really say because I'm really scared of like well obviously I want to be in an environment where I had lots of friends
02:09:29 I'm like, but if I had friends growing up
02:09:31 I might have never become anywhere near the person I am now and therefore would never like have any of the same thoughts
02:09:36 I mean, it's in theoretically possible. You might have just become a way better person
02:09:40 I wouldn't become a better person. You would definitely not be you though
02:09:44 So it's basically saying that DeVoo would not exist. Right. Is that a plus?
02:09:48 I would have changed that like my father would smash
02:09:55 Destroy my shins with a 2x4 every day to strengthen them so that I could
02:10:01 Like you mean like break them or something or like yeah smash
02:10:09 Yeah, that guy that guy got it all figured out. I wish I was retarded. I wish I was autistic and retarded
02:10:16 You know that means that you need to be mentally retarded as well so you can run really fast
02:10:20 Oh, so that's what worked well for Forrest Gump. That's what worked out for him. He wasn't retarded
02:10:24 He was just a little slow learned differently
02:10:28 What I like about removing my libidos that they probably would not change who I become in the sense that like I would probably still be in the PCP
02:10:36 I just would have experienced less pain in my life. That's probably true
02:10:41 Yeah, I mean having a little sex drive is kind of hell
02:10:45 In general just in general
02:10:48 Well, that's that there was another question. There was another pity question that I thought was
02:10:53 Yeah, that was pretty good. Who was that again? Who is that question from again? That is from Lines Lines
02:11:00 Not bad killer not bad slayms. Yeah. Yeah confirm killer a
02:11:05 Confirm killer. Oh, that's good. Here's a here's a question from Never Paint. All right
02:11:09 This is listen to the whole question before you respond, please
02:11:12 It is uh, do you eat dried nasal mucus? What are your thoughts about it? Listen? Listen delicious disgusting
02:11:20 It seems to be a very divisive topic
02:11:24 Where I feel like this question is some kind of statement, but I don't know what the statement is this man is telling me
02:11:30 Never paint here is saying that like there's a there's a hotly debated
02:11:34 It's a contested issue whether or not it's good to eat and dried nasal. I guess he means boogers
02:11:41 Yeah, it's when it's dry it's disgusting and you got to get rid of it. It's like eating a
02:11:47 Ironic joke well
02:11:51 I know I know that some people eat their own like they they they eat snot because it's in their throat
02:11:57 Well, that's fine. I mean, what can you do? I mean if it doesn't come out of your mouth then swallowing it is not eating it
02:12:03 If in the in the past make any sense in the past
02:12:06 I have no idea what anyone would do that. I don't understand us at all or relate to us at all
02:12:10 What I don't know right that nothing to say however now my fiancee does in fact do this
02:12:23 She has all sorts of tics like she knows she's like, you know like she's like
02:12:27 She eats her like nails too, right? I'm like, you have to
02:12:31 I mean, I mean, do you eat them? I mean, no, I don't I clip my nails
02:12:36 So I don't get biting them that sounds like hell and then she also eats them. I'm like what the what and then like
02:12:42 I don't eat the nails. I
02:12:44 Like I like bite my nails
02:12:48 Yeah
02:12:50 I'm too. I'm like what the fuck and then she gets whenever she's whenever she eats her boogers
02:12:54 I'm like why she's like a it's actually a lot of nutrients. It's actually like good for your immune
02:13:00 Oh
02:13:02 You got the fucking excuse
02:13:07 This is rich proteins
02:13:12 I mean, I recycle my semen, you know
02:13:21 The reason why I don't think about it much is that it's not even like in the top tier of like like tics nervous
02:13:27 She hasn't like
02:13:40 She pops pimples, but she also wants to pop my pimples it's therapeutic for her to pop my pimples now
02:13:50 Someone who pops my pimples unless it's in the state
02:13:53 Hold on. I mean if you have a pimple, what are you gonna do but pop it?
02:13:57 Yeah, I just leave it like that goes away and then wash my face fucking better and have a better diet, right?
02:14:02 Well, why would you not pop it?
02:14:04 Well, I only pop it when it's in like an annoying spot like on like ear or like it's right next to my nose
02:14:08 Why would you not pop it because it hurts fucking hurts you?
02:14:13 All right, and then like it hurts. I guess I have a low pain threshold
02:14:17 I think I think I have like sensitive skin and shit, right guys. Do we have to talk about this?
02:14:21 Can we get away from this?
02:14:22 I'll be like laying in bed.
02:14:23 Wait, this is a pimple popping contest now!
02:14:25 All right, all right, and I'll be like laying in bed and she's like oh hold on you got an acne right here
02:14:29 And I'm just like fucking screaming because sometimes they like really really really fucking hurt and like her
02:14:35 This is a nightmare.
02:14:36 She's got very...
02:14:37 Yeah, this is... this is dark.
02:14:38 She's got very different skin for me like her skin is very tough
02:14:41 Like just to be able to scratch an itch, she does a level of scratching that would like leave my skin red afterwards, right?
02:14:47 So that was one of the things we had to get used to was our very different like she'll just like
02:14:50 Hey, when we're gonna like dry off your back with a towel and she'll like do it so hard to like fucking give me rug burns
02:14:55 Like no, no, no my skin is like way thinner than yours. So like for her acne doesn't really hurt that much to pop
02:15:01 I've taken my headphones off.
02:15:02 But it's super fucking like hurts to have I guess like it's just annoying for her to have it so she constantly has to pop it
02:15:07 So like yeah, like there'll be times where I'm like
02:15:10 Just like hey, let me pop this pimple and I just fucking scream. She's like why are you using a baby?
02:15:14 I'm like it hurts.
02:15:15 I missed it. I missed a DeVoo.
02:15:18 When I'm walking down the street playing Jurassic World Alive to him
02:15:23 I'm walking out with my cane and all these fucking whores and Jezebel's throwing themselves at me
02:15:29 Oh, can I pop your pimples? Oh, can I eat your boogers? It's just so fucking taxing. So you have to walk down the street
02:15:35 I have to worry about that. No, no, you fucking succulent bitches. No, those boogers are from my own
02:15:41 Those pimple puzzles are from my own steaks and garnishes
02:15:45 You're not good to have my delicacies. I lost my appetite
02:15:50 Cooking has been
02:15:52 This day, it's it's well, it was a fucking question askers fault. No, I mean this true
02:15:57 I guess it was my fault for choosing but whatever doesn't matter. Anyway, let's go back with a fucking lounge pick some real questions
02:16:03 I have one. Okay. All right. I think this could be the last one, which I quite like I think you guys might think it's retarded
02:16:09 But I like my chipmice win. What's your food?
02:16:12 Sona if you were an item, what would oh avocado rice?
02:16:16 all right, I
02:16:18 Would be something they would be a cheap Jim Ben would be a slim. I think I'd be now
02:16:22 I think I'd be a paw paw what the fuck is up. I got a look this is a PAW like PAW. I think
02:16:30 Is it PAW? Okay, I see it. I would just be an avocado. That'd be my my thing. Yeah
02:16:36 You're very you're very millennial
02:16:38 Yeah, no, I would be something cheap
02:16:42 Yeah, I would be I would be like
02:16:46 You're something cheap mysterious and you don't know why you're eating it, but you are and this is your life now
02:16:52 All right, I got mine. I would be
02:16:56 Delicious mashed potato with onion gravy. That's pretty good. That's not bad
