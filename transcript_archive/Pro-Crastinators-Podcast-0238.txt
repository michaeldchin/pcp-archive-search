00:00:00 I'm ready. I'm recording my Redman.
00:00:05 Okay, so you're...
00:00:10 I don't even want to know what just happened over there.
00:00:13 So you're doing the Redman.
00:00:15 I'm doing the Redman, yeah.
00:00:17 Oh, God.
00:00:20 I like it. I like it personally.
00:00:23 All right, if you...
00:00:26 I kind of like the unfinished slight jank of Redman.
00:00:29 Like, I'm watching it right now and it makes...
00:00:31 It comforts me on a spiritual level.
00:00:33 The way his body moves is very comforting.
00:00:38 Yeah, he's...
00:00:39 Yeah, it's so squishy.
00:00:40 It's like a bowl of Jello as a child.
00:00:42 Yeah, yeah, he's like...
00:00:44 I really wish my eyes moved where my direction is,
00:00:48 but they just don't.
00:00:49 It really is just like he's full of blood.
00:00:53 If you popped him, he would just...
00:00:56 And what's more comforting than that, right?
00:00:58 What's more comforting?
00:00:59 Exactly.
00:01:00 It's warm.
00:01:02 It is.
00:01:04 Among other things.
00:01:07 Fuck, well, should we just...
00:01:09 Should we go?
00:01:10 Yes, let's just go.
00:01:11 Oh, yeah.
00:01:12 That was a cold open.
00:01:13 Okay, oh, that was a cold open.
00:01:14 Okay.
00:01:16 Welcome to the Procrastiners podcast.
00:01:18 We got me Ben St.
00:01:20 We got Gibb and Take.
00:01:21 Hey, it's me.
00:01:22 And AKA Redman.
00:01:24 Yeah, well, look at the screen.
00:01:26 It's me.
00:01:27 Guys, Redman's here.
00:01:29 Redman's here.
00:01:31 And sorry, guest, fuck you.
00:01:35 While Redman's here.
00:01:38 Not only is Redman here.
00:01:39 Redman Merch is here.
00:01:41 In the form of the ratty fuckers cop killers,
00:01:44 an endless war of pins.
00:01:46 Pog.
00:01:47 The Pog pins from the kick starters are in.
00:01:49 Eleazar, show them.
00:01:50 Show the Merch.
00:01:51 Redman's there.
00:01:52 You can get him.
00:01:53 I have a tweet.
00:01:54 I will link a tweet.
00:01:55 Where I explain.
00:01:57 If you missed it and you want to get in on it,
00:01:59 you want to buy any of this cool shit.
00:02:01 I have that.
00:02:02 I have spent another week this week fucking doing
00:02:06 envelopes and shit.
00:02:07 It's very cool.
00:02:08 They're very...
00:02:09 They look great.
00:02:10 They look so good.
00:02:11 They look so good.
00:02:12 Okay.
00:02:13 Where Redman?
00:02:14 That's the point.
00:02:15 And we got low art.
00:02:16 Our guest today is YouTube man, low art.
00:02:19 Oh, yes.
00:02:20 Who I did a...
00:02:21 Yes.
00:02:22 You want to introduce yourself?
00:02:24 Yeah, sure.
00:02:25 I am the low art.
00:02:27 I make videos.
00:02:29 I am ashamed to say that I am a tuber.
00:02:32 That's a shameful thing to say.
00:02:34 Are you a Vtuber?
00:02:36 Just a tuber.
00:02:37 Just a tuber.
00:02:38 Not a Vtuber.
00:02:39 Terrible.
00:02:40 Yeah.
00:02:41 It is terrible, isn't it?
00:02:42 This is a...
00:02:43 It's like a support group for recovering tubers.
00:02:48 It's very important to have that because people don't
00:02:50 understand that it's a disease.
00:02:52 It's an affliction, especially when you review other
00:02:55 people's content primarily.
00:02:57 I just review TV shows and video games.
00:03:00 Actually, a funny bit of lore is that one of my very
00:03:04 first videos on my channel is an orchestral cover of
00:03:07 the PCP theme.
00:03:09 Wait, what?
00:03:10 What?
00:03:11 Yeah, you can find it.
00:03:12 It's still up there.
00:03:13 A PCP fan makes reviews.
00:03:15 I didn't know that.
00:03:17 Yeah, it was one of my earliest things.
00:03:19 Endless Jess commented on it calling me a fucking
00:03:21 hero.
00:03:22 It was pretty great at the time.
00:03:23 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:03:24 I had no idea about that.
00:03:27 Okay, that's wild.
00:03:29 All right.
00:03:30 That changes...
00:03:31 I got to say, this changes everything.
00:03:33 Oh, man.
00:03:34 Wow.
00:03:35 Yeah.
00:03:36 We were just going to relentlessly shit on you, but now
00:03:39 we like you.
00:03:40 Yeah.
00:03:41 Oh, okay.
00:03:42 Well, that's...
00:03:43 I mean, you can still relentlessly shit on me because
00:03:45 I feel like that's more fun.
00:03:47 Yeah.
00:03:48 Okay.
00:03:49 Okay.
00:03:50 Good, good, good.
00:03:51 Stupid.
00:03:52 What...
00:03:53 So what have you...
00:03:54 What have you been...
00:03:55 I'm sorry, I haven't looked at your channel in a little
00:03:57 bit.
00:03:58 What have you been making recently?
00:03:59 What have you been doing?
00:04:00 You know, I jump all over.
00:04:02 I started making more video game stuff.
00:04:05 Hmm.
00:04:06 I just made a video complaining about Nintendo being
00:04:09 stupid, which is like just a cottage industry you can
00:04:12 always complain.
00:04:13 Is it about the Melee thing?
00:04:15 Melee taken down Twitch streamers for streaming a game
00:04:20 too early.
00:04:21 Yeah.
00:04:22 Yeah.
00:04:23 Yeah.
00:04:24 Yeah.
00:04:25 Yeah.
00:04:26 Yeah.
00:04:27 Yeah.
00:04:28 Yeah.
00:04:29 Yeah.
00:04:30 Yeah.
00:04:31 Yeah.
00:04:32 Yeah.
00:04:33 Yeah.
00:04:34 Yeah.
00:04:35 Just that stuff.
00:04:36 Yeah.
00:04:37 I always...
00:04:38 I'm in a perpetual cycle of abuse.
00:04:39 You had like older videos about Fullmetal Alchemist and
00:04:41 then you made like a bigger series about it, right?
00:04:43 Yeah.
00:04:44 I had like a big series, but it was old and shitty.
00:04:47 Okay.
00:04:48 And like it was me figuring out how to make videos and I
00:04:50 was doing absolutely brain dead things like mixing the
00:04:53 background audio in with me speaking and then I was
00:04:56 unable to take it apart because I deleted files and I
00:04:59 was just...
00:05:00 It was a struggle.
00:05:01 So I decided to go back and make it less shitty and that
00:05:05 turned out to be a pretty good decision.
00:05:07 So that's nice.
00:05:09 Excellent.
00:05:10 Yeah.
00:05:11 Excellent.
00:05:13 So what's Redman been getting up to?
00:05:16 Hey, Redman.
00:05:17 Yeah.
00:05:18 How you been, man?
00:05:19 I've been done.
00:05:20 I'm all right.
00:05:21 I exist in the 2D, 2.5D realm.
00:05:25 Look how squishy you are.
00:05:27 Have you been working out?
00:05:28 Yeah.
00:05:29 Your stoutness exercises?
00:05:31 I've been doing those...
00:05:34 What do you call them?
00:05:35 Crunches?
00:05:36 Scrumples?
00:05:37 Scree-crumples.
00:05:39 The Redman crumples.
00:05:41 Yeah.
00:05:42 Doin' squashes.
00:05:44 Squashes, yes, squashes.
00:05:46 It's different from a squat.
00:05:48 I don't know how, really.
00:05:50 Because there's no bones or muscles involved.
00:05:52 It's all fluid hydraulics.
00:05:54 It's all like a...
00:05:55 You ever see Big Hero 6?
00:05:58 I'm like that guy.
00:05:59 Yeah.
00:06:00 The Red.
00:06:01 Blood inside.
00:06:02 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:06:03 It's like...
00:06:04 When Redman works out, it's actually...
00:06:06 It's to keep his outer membrane supple.
00:06:09 That's the...
00:06:10 That's the goal.
00:06:13 Redman is like...
00:06:14 Oh, man.
00:06:15 Is Redman like...
00:06:17 Okay.
00:06:18 Now, I don't think I talked about this specifically in the JDR lecture.
00:06:24 But there's a thing about the slimes, or the jellies, rather.
00:06:27 The jellies are...
00:06:29 They're the white life forms.
00:06:31 And they're just cellular clusters, basically.
00:06:34 They're just fluid clusters.
00:06:36 And they're drawn the way she draws eyes.
00:06:39 She draws them with this big vertical oval.
00:06:42 And they look glossy.
00:06:44 That's just how she draws eyes.
00:06:45 But she's made close-up diagrams.
00:06:47 And she does anatomical diagrams with the jellies.
00:06:51 And literally, the jellies have vertical strips
00:06:56 of ocular cells or something that go up and down
00:07:02 on the surface of their membrane.
00:07:05 Right?
00:07:06 That's like...
00:07:07 They're literally shaped like that.
00:07:09 Are Redman's eyes like that, or does he just have two eyeballs floating in there?
00:07:13 I mean, it's a very complicated thing you just said.
00:07:17 I don't know.
00:07:19 I definitely have eyeballs, but I can't blink for some reason.
00:07:23 I haven't figured that out yet.
00:07:25 No eyelids.
00:07:28 I don't know if Redman needs to blink.
00:07:30 It looks like Redman has seen so much in his time
00:07:33 that he's forgotten how to blink because he must always keep his eyes wide open for any threats.
00:07:37 Is Pupil's moved?
00:07:39 Yeah, when the face tracking breaks, he just goes to default mode,
00:07:47 which means he stares directly at the camera, which is kind of funny.
00:07:53 He bears into your soul.
00:07:56 You know what?
00:07:58 Man, I think we talked about this when Mary was here,
00:08:01 but I think it's cool.
00:08:04 I wonder if there's some simple way to just have one arm.
00:08:10 If I had a V-Tube avatar, which maybe I will work on one,
00:08:15 but I would like to have a face and a body that moves around.
00:08:20 You can do a full VR setup if you're really fucking fancy.
00:08:25 I would just want one arm that I could just gesture with.
00:08:29 That would be cool.
00:08:31 Just one so I could just make a little Italian like,
00:08:33 what are you talking about?
00:08:35 Like imagining a puppet arm on a stick that you could wave in front to be like,
00:08:42 oh yes, I'm gesturing.
00:08:45 That would be cool.
00:08:47 What just simple gestures?
00:08:50 If I was streaming or something, I could have a PNG of an arm and just move it around.
00:08:56 Oh, bad.
00:08:58 Oh, just click it with a mouse and just like...
00:09:01 Yeah, click it with a mouse on the stream on OBS and then drag it around the screen like,
00:09:05 oh yes, something with my hands.
00:09:10 Just like a flat, open palm hand full on front view and just like,
00:09:15 wag it back and forth like, hi guys.
00:09:19 Yeah.
00:09:21 I feel like you could do it though.
00:09:23 I think you could do it.
00:09:24 You might have to like cover one of your arms in like green or something,
00:09:27 like a green cloth so that the program doesn't pick it up maybe.
00:09:31 I feel like it would be from like a user end.
00:09:35 I don't know if you could jigger the software to do it,
00:09:38 but from like a developer end, I feel like maybe it wouldn't be that hard to,
00:09:44 like instead of like a VR glove, because that's how like ones with more limbs work,
00:09:49 they have like VR gloves and feet and stuff,
00:09:52 you could maybe just have like just something you could hold,
00:09:55 like it's just something you could like hold in your hand,
00:09:57 maybe like a like a fucking Wiimote like like light thing or something and like,
00:10:02 just so we could see where that is and it would just move the hand with that single point, right?
00:10:07 It did not like a fully articulated like five finger hand or anything.
00:10:10 Just a Wiimote dangling in the air.
00:10:13 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:10:16 It's not an arm. It's just an image of a Wiimote.
00:10:18 Yeah, much better because you're a gamer.
00:10:21 It's your hardcore gamer.
00:10:22 Well, we're all gamer girls here, so.
00:10:24 Yay.
00:10:25 True.
00:10:26 Yeah.
00:10:27 So, um...
00:10:28 Yeah, so I wanted to mention about the creation of Redman VR, VTuber, not VR.
00:10:36 I have to thank Mage for helping with one aspect.
00:10:41 She told me that in the way you make these things,
00:10:45 you have a Photoshop file with all the different layers of all the different things
00:10:49 you want to move independently from one another,
00:10:51 and you input that into a thing called Live2D Cubism,
00:10:56 and they have like templates like pre-made anime characters that you can animate,
00:11:04 which means they have like rigged all of the head motion, the body motion, the arms,
00:11:09 the blinking eyes and the mouth and stuff.
00:11:12 You can just apply a new Photoshop file to those existing rigs,
00:11:19 so you don't actually need to make anything.
00:11:21 You just need to tweak it so that it doesn't look strange.
00:11:24 So what I did, what Mage told me about is you can get like a chibi character that they have,
00:11:30 and I just like mapped the eyes to the eyes, the mouth to the mouth, the head and the body,
00:11:34 and then I deleted like all of the hair and the arms and stuff that I need.
00:11:38 And I just exported it. It was very easy.
00:11:42 When I did it, because I asked Mage about it, and she also told me about Live2D.
00:11:49 Wait, I don't think I used a template, although there is like an automatic,
00:11:56 there is like you can sort of just tell it to like automatically map a bunch of like mapping points onto your files.
00:12:05 I made like a Photoshop file from scratch, loaded it in and then just told it like auto-generate,
00:12:14 mapping points, which it did.
00:12:18 I got mine to move its head and to make expressions with its mouth,
00:12:25 and the mouth worked really well, but he didn't have any eyelids, his eyes,
00:12:30 because he had really big eyes, and I think maybe it made him sensitive,
00:12:34 because his pupils would not stay steady, they would kind of like jitter in place,
00:12:38 even if I wasn't moving my eyes.
00:12:40 And I tried to make his hair like flow back and forth, but it wouldn't.
00:12:45 It stayed stiff, and I never figured out why, but I had it so we could tilt his head,
00:12:49 and I could just like Mary's cat ears.
00:12:52 I said it so that he had like ears that you could control when his eyebrows went up,
00:12:56 his ears would go up, and when his eyebrows went down, his ears would go down.
00:12:59 I should fuck around with him some more.
00:13:01 Yeah, I feel like I need to add functionality, maybe eyebrows, so he can be angry,
00:13:07 but the thing I really need right now is-
00:13:09 It's like a robot.
00:13:11 It's like a robot friend who you can like tinker with sometimes.
00:13:14 You can like step in there and be like, hmm, maybe I'll give him like a more robust set of expressions.
00:13:21 Maybe I'll give him like a soul or something.
00:13:24 Maybe I'll make him sad and loose in the end.
00:13:27 Give him some morale, morality, morale.
00:13:31 Maybe I'll give him a dark backstory and a quest for vengeance today,
00:13:36 and you go in and you abuse him.
00:13:38 Redman has the eyes of a killer, you know.
00:13:42 That's well-
00:13:43 He shouldn't because he's a rowdy.
00:13:45 He's a fucking fusser.
00:13:47 All right.
00:13:48 He's like, Redman has the potential to murder.
00:13:52 That's my opinion.
00:13:53 Oh, no question about that.
00:13:56 Yeah, the lore of Redman, if you don't know, is in New Los Angeles City,
00:14:02 aka Neo Milwaukee, also known as Slime City,
00:14:06 there is two gangs, the rowdy fuckers and the cop killers,
00:14:10 and Redman stumbled in one day and he was like,
00:14:15 hey guys, what's going on?
00:14:17 And he loves blood.
00:14:20 He wants blood and he kills people,
00:14:22 but then turns out people in Slime City bleed slime instead of blood,
00:14:27 and so you're just like, well, fuck it, fuck it, whatever.
00:14:31 Can't do anything around this place.
00:14:33 So he's like, he's kind of a weird pacifist.
00:14:35 He's only a pacifist because there's no blood anywhere.
00:14:38 There's no blood.
00:14:40 Wow, it's like a vampire that doesn't kill just because like, why bother?
00:14:44 I can't get blood from these people.
00:14:46 All there is is this dang useless slime.
00:14:51 What a fucking quirky weirdo.
00:14:53 He's from...
00:14:54 That's a beautiful idea.
00:14:56 He's from...
00:14:58 Fuck, what's the place in Lord of Ghosts?
00:15:02 Oh, it's New New Biggin by the Sea, aka Neo York.
00:15:06 Yeah, he's from New Biggin, aka Neo York, right?
00:15:09 Originally, he emigrated or something or floated across the sea.
00:15:14 He maybe took the train, I don't know.
00:15:16 The tale of Red Man's journey is a strange one.
00:15:21 He probably doesn't even remember.
00:15:23 Yeah.
00:15:24 It's shrouded in mystery, to say the least.
00:15:26 Yeah, yeah.
00:15:27 And intrigue.
00:15:31 And now here he is.
00:15:32 He's gone on a journey and now he's here, guys.
00:15:34 He made it.
00:15:35 I made it all the way to the PCP.
00:15:37 The top of the pyramid.
00:15:38 I love the sassy little head bobs he's doing from time to time.
00:15:41 Yeah, I really like...
00:15:42 Oh yeah, hell yeah.
00:15:44 Yeah, it's so cool to see him move like that.
00:15:47 And then he looks straight at the camera.
00:15:50 I have to finish one.
00:15:53 I have to finish one.
00:15:57 Soon.
00:15:58 Soon.
00:15:59 Okay.
00:16:02 Yeah, so what's going on?
00:16:05 What's going on, dudes?
00:16:06 What do we want to talk about?
00:16:08 Do you got any topics to discuss of interest this week?
00:16:13 You know what?
00:16:14 I'm...
00:16:15 I'll think of something.
00:16:17 I always think of something.
00:16:19 I can't believe you would show up unprepared.
00:16:21 Listen, my life is spent...
00:16:23 Oh yeah, there we go.
00:16:24 That's what we could talk about.
00:16:25 Life is just spent being unprepared.
00:16:28 That's all that being...
00:16:30 Like, my life since...
00:16:33 All of this lockdown crap and everything.
00:16:36 And I don't mean crap as in it's stupid,
00:16:38 because you got to lock shit down sometimes.
00:16:41 I just mean I'm hiding out in my house.
00:16:43 My sleep schedule is abysmal.
00:16:45 Waking up at 5 p.m. sometimes.
00:16:47 Going like, what has happened to me?
00:16:49 What have I become?
00:16:50 Dude, I've...
00:16:51 So how are you keeping yourself sane?
00:16:53 Maybe that's a good topic.
00:16:55 I've had quite a week in terms of like sleep schedule.
00:17:00 You know, sometimes I go to bed a bit late.
00:17:02 Oh, boo-hoo.
00:17:03 Wake up, boo-hoo.
00:17:05 But this time it was like, I almost stayed up for an entire day.
00:17:09 Just casually, just like not even thinking about it.
00:17:11 I went to bed at 7.30 a.m. one of those days.
00:17:15 It was just sort of like, what the fuck?
00:17:18 I can't get a handle on this.
00:17:21 I have gotten completely fucked up.
00:17:24 I finally gave up and put up blackout curtains
00:17:27 so I could just like go to sleep at like 1 p.m.
00:17:32 and wake up at like, you know, 11 p.m.
00:17:36 and just go like...
00:17:38 I'm saying that I'm also just completely fucked up.
00:17:40 Okay, yeah.
00:17:41 It's the worst for me and this was where I felt truly like I had failed myself
00:17:45 was I said, you know what, enough's enough.
00:17:48 I'm staying up a whole night and then I'm not going to sleep
00:17:51 and then I'm going to go to bed at a normal time.
00:17:54 And then I went to bed at a normal time
00:17:56 and I wake up and it's like 3 p.m. and I go, well, what the fuck?
00:17:59 That's literally...
00:18:00 That's exactly what happened to me today.
00:18:02 That's exactly what happened to me today.
00:18:04 That's the opposite happened to me.
00:18:06 I was like, you know what?
00:18:07 I should really go to bed at a reasonable time tonight.
00:18:09 I stayed up until 6 again.
00:18:11 And I was like, well, I fucked it up.
00:18:13 I go to bed.
00:18:14 I wake up at 11 and I'm fine.
00:18:17 I don't know how that worked.
00:18:19 I mean, if you're in like...
00:18:21 Well, if you're in like a rhythm, I don't know.
00:18:23 Like when you're in a rhythm, sometimes you wake up at the same time
00:18:26 no matter when you went to sleep.
00:18:28 But I've always been waking up at like 3 p.m. then 4 p.m. then 5 p.m.
00:18:32 I was like...
00:18:33 Yeah.
00:18:34 The days just are nothing.
00:18:35 All I'm learning is that we all need help.
00:18:37 Everything is meaningless.
00:18:38 All I have is my video games and anime.
00:18:42 And my red man.
00:18:43 And my red man.
00:18:45 That's all you really need though.
00:18:47 It's true.
00:18:48 And his warm and his blood to keep me warm at night.
00:18:50 Yeah, it's getting cold these winter months.
00:18:56 Hell yeah.
00:18:57 Yeah.
00:19:00 Yeah.
00:19:01 I'm all fucked up.
00:19:03 I'm at odd hours.
00:19:05 I don't see anyone.
00:19:06 I got my blackout curtains up.
00:19:07 It's dark in here all the time.
00:19:08 It's great.
00:19:09 I've regressed.
00:19:10 I've regressed to like...
00:19:14 I don't know.
00:19:15 I guess I was gonna like pick a time in my life when I've also been
00:19:18 just like no outside world, no relation to the outside world.
00:19:22 But there's actually been multiple times.
00:19:23 This happens every so often.
00:19:25 It's completely unhinged and off of any schedule at all.
00:19:28 It's great.
00:19:29 It's nice.
00:19:30 I don't even mind it.
00:19:31 Eventually you have to accept it.
00:19:33 Yeah, I'm at the point where I'm accepting it.
00:19:35 I'm like, I'm staying up real late again.
00:19:37 But you know what?
00:19:38 I'm awake.
00:19:39 And usually at the end of the day I'm like, well, that was a long time.
00:19:45 Like sweat off my brow day of playing video games.
00:19:48 It's time to do some art.
00:19:50 It's time to draw.
00:19:51 And I do a little bit of drawing.
00:19:54 And it's, you know, like if I'm awake and I feel like doing some work
00:19:58 right at the end of the day, I guess I may as well capitalize on that
00:20:01 if that's gonna happen.
00:20:03 So just this is how it is.
00:20:05 I don't have any control over anything.
00:20:07 I'm just gonna like take things as they come.
00:20:10 Well, that's the issue is like prime time for me has become 1 a.m. to 6 a.m.
00:20:16 Like when I'm up at that time, I'm working because if I don't,
00:20:19 I have like this sense of what am I doing wrong?
00:20:22 So you just you just plow through work at those hours.
00:20:25 That's probably when Red Man was created, you know, when I one thing I always
00:20:30 find that if I if I wake up and if I start doing something productive
00:20:36 immediately, I will have like a good and productive day.
00:20:40 And if I don't, I'm fucked.
00:20:42 Like if I if I wake up and I start like, you know, wasting time or doing
00:20:46 this like 90 95 percent of the time, I will continue to do that for the
00:20:53 rest of the day.
00:20:54 So like my my like self hack is like, yeah, OK, if something needs to get
00:20:58 done, just make sure that I do something like immediately when I wake
00:21:03 up and then I'm like, I've like set myself on the right course for
00:21:07 like, yeah, my wife.
00:21:09 I won't wait today.
00:21:10 Yeah.
00:21:11 Like she she scared the shit out of me.
00:21:15 My wife, because all of a sudden she just like the alarm went off and then
00:21:19 she did like pretty much a full front flip up out of the bed, just like
00:21:23 catapulting her body.
00:21:25 And I'm like, what are you doing?
00:21:26 And she's like, well, if I don't do this, I'm not doing anything.
00:21:30 Like it's either I get that with this flip.
00:21:33 That is like just just catapults.
00:21:36 I see. OK.
00:21:37 That is like leave the bed with momentum.
00:21:39 Leave the bed.
00:21:40 Yeah. Get out of the bed.
00:21:41 That's the first step.
00:21:43 I mean, some of the some of the days I'm like, most of the time I keep my
00:21:47 phone on my desk out of reach, so I have to get out of bed.
00:21:51 If I want to check my tweets, I want to see the notifications that are coming
00:21:54 in.
00:21:55 Hell, yeah, hell, yeah.
00:21:58 It was a good strategy.
00:22:01 If you the worst is when I wake up and the pure heft and beauty of my cat
00:22:06 is on top of me and I'm like, well, I can't possibly get up now because I
00:22:09 can't disturb the boy.
00:22:11 I fucking hate cats.
00:22:13 I fucking.
00:22:14 How dare you?
00:22:15 No.
00:22:16 How dare you?
00:22:17 They're like that.
00:22:18 They're like that.
00:22:19 And it's so awful.
00:22:20 It's beautiful.
00:22:21 It's the best thing to ever happen to me.
00:22:23 God, no.
00:22:24 Well, how does your cat appreciate being moved?
00:22:27 That's the question.
00:22:28 That's the killer question.
00:22:30 He accepts anything and everything that we do.
00:22:33 He's like, that's very complacent.
00:22:36 Like if I want to get up, I can do it.
00:22:38 I don't want to because he's so snuggly and nice.
00:22:41 I see.
00:22:42 Okay.
00:22:43 All right.
00:22:44 See, it's all about framing.
00:22:45 It's all about framing.
00:22:46 When the cat is like going to attack you for moving them, then it's like, I'm not
00:22:49 in control.
00:22:50 I don't.
00:22:51 I'm a prisoner here.
00:22:52 I'm forced to feed this person.
00:22:55 He's not like that.
00:22:56 But like the cat I have similar is just like completely complacent.
00:23:00 I can pick her up in any way and she will always find an excuse to start licking
00:23:07 her hand, even if she's like sort of trying to get away.
00:23:10 She's just like sort of normal.
00:23:12 Like, oh, it's a person lick.
00:23:15 It's good.
00:23:16 That's so nice.
00:23:17 Yeah.
00:23:18 The beautiful sandpaper ton brushing across your skin.
00:23:20 Yeah.
00:23:22 Ben, I don't understand how you couldn't like cats.
00:23:26 I used to think like you.
00:23:28 I used to think like you.
00:23:29 I just don't.
00:23:30 Then you don't use, I don't know.
00:23:31 It's just, it's not that I hate them or anything, but like, I don't particularly, I like them
00:23:35 well enough, but like, I wouldn't want to own one.
00:23:39 Like if I see a nice cat, I'll pet it or whatever.
00:23:42 Yeah.
00:23:43 Oh, okay.
00:23:44 There you go.
00:23:45 Yeah.
00:23:46 You aren't out here kicking cats.
00:23:47 I'm not out here kicking cats, but if I, but if I woke up and there was a cat on me,
00:23:49 I wouldn't be like, oh, I'd be like, get the fuck up.
00:23:53 Well, like I wake up and he's wrapped around my arm, like just cuddling up against me.
00:24:00 And I'm like, well, what are you doing?
00:24:02 You know, you sweaty being you warm creature.
00:24:05 Hmm.
00:24:06 It's, it's great.
00:24:07 You know, so this, like this cat shows, shows us, we went to go look at the, at the shelter
00:24:14 with all the animals and he's reaching through the bars, just wanted to have belly rubs.
00:24:18 That's how you find a good one as you go.
00:24:21 And that's why I learned I didn't know this until, until this moment was like, it was
00:24:25 right after Halloween, like a little, a couple of weeks.
00:24:28 And we found him.
00:24:29 And I learned that apparently animal shelters often won't sell black cats around Halloween
00:24:35 because people will like buy them to like, I don't know, sacrifice them or something.
00:24:39 I don't know what's going on in the world.
00:24:41 What?
00:24:42 Truly.
00:24:43 Yeah.
00:24:44 Yeah.
00:24:45 Wait, I thought that'd be like a fake thing, but then people there were confirming to me
00:24:47 like, oh yeah, no, we, we can't sell them around then because bad things will happen to
00:24:51 them.
00:24:52 And I just, what the fuck?
00:24:53 All right.
00:24:54 At first I was thinking, oh, you can't sell black cats because it's like a Christmas thing.
00:24:57 People buy a puppy for Christmas and then they don't actually want to keep it.
00:25:01 Like get a, they get a black cat for Halloween just for their costume.
00:25:04 And then they throw it in the dumpster afterwards.
00:25:06 But sacrificing, like what, what is that?
00:25:09 Like, I guess some, you might be right about some of it.
00:25:12 Part of it might be a weird thing for like Halloween festivities of having a costume
00:25:16 piece.
00:25:17 But yeah, it sounded like some people are out here ritualistic sacrifices to the blood
00:25:22 god.
00:25:23 I don't know what's going on.
00:25:24 Well, if you're talking about a blood god, then it's fine.
00:25:27 I'm sorry.
00:25:28 What are people sacrificing for Halloween?
00:25:31 Black cats, man.
00:25:32 Black cats.
00:25:33 Like butchering them?
00:25:34 I don't know.
00:25:35 I don't, that's, that's a question I still have to this day when they said like, yeah,
00:25:38 we can't sell them because people will hurt them.
00:25:40 And I'm like, uh, I didn't know that we live in, in a world where we're still holding on
00:25:46 to superstitions of black cats so deeply that we would go out of our way to harm them.
00:25:51 Geez, geez, frickin Louise.
00:25:53 My cat's a black cat.
00:25:54 Never heard of such a thing.
00:25:55 And she's like, it's great because she's cool and like it looks like a little panther in
00:26:00 the distance in a silhouette sort of way.
00:26:03 Um, but you can't take a picture of her.
00:26:06 I've never been able to show anyone what she looks like through a phone.
00:26:10 It just doesn't work.
00:26:12 It is a struggle.
00:26:13 They're just black blobs.
00:26:15 Wait, I saw, I saw a really good poorly drawn cat the other day.
00:26:20 Um, and I have to, um,
00:26:22 Was it the square?
00:26:23 Show you.
00:26:24 It was the square.
00:26:26 Yeah.
00:26:27 Wait, I'll encase lower.
00:26:29 It hasn't seen.
00:26:30 I will throw that in the, in the boom, baby.
00:26:34 There it is.
00:26:35 Okay.
00:26:36 I'll check out this poorly, poorly drawn cat.
00:26:38 Oh, I did see that.
00:26:39 I didn't see that.
00:26:40 I really like it.
00:26:41 Yeah.
00:26:42 That's fucked up.
00:26:43 Honestly, it's fucked up that it could be shaped like that to begin with.
00:26:46 I don't know.
00:26:47 That's upsetting.
00:26:48 They're liquid beings.
00:26:49 I guess so.
00:26:54 They're like memory cat.
00:26:55 Okay.
00:26:56 Like, whoa, what the hell happened to my eyes just there?
00:27:00 I think blinking fucks up the thing.
00:27:03 They, when you blink, they like jerk back to neutral.
00:27:08 They do something.
00:27:09 Right?
00:27:10 When your, when your eyes are closed, it doesn't know where to put your pupils.
00:27:12 So it just puts them back in the neutral position.
00:27:15 That's what it probably would be.
00:27:17 It's because you don't have eyelids on the thing yet.
00:27:19 Right?
00:27:20 Yeah.
00:27:21 That they're, that yeah, I need to add like a Photoshop layer of the eyes being closed.
00:27:26 I didn't think of that.
00:27:28 Oh, I just saw them do a little twirly thing.
00:27:31 They just did a little like.
00:27:34 Awesome.
00:27:35 Awesome.
00:27:39 I'm just looking at it.
00:27:40 I'm just looking at it.
00:27:41 I'm squished.
00:27:42 It's just, I keep looking at him.
00:27:43 He's mesmerizing.
00:27:44 Yeah.
00:27:45 Like a body, like a bowl of Jell-O bearing into my soul.
00:27:49 It's, I love him.
00:27:50 It's, it's so cool.
00:27:51 I, I really, I'm, I'm happy.
00:27:54 I'm happy that Red Man exists finally.
00:27:56 After all these years, he's finally.
00:27:58 He's finally real.
00:27:59 He's finally real.
00:28:01 Oh no, he's, he's frozen.
00:28:03 He's staring at me.
00:28:04 He's stopped staring at me, Red Man.
00:28:05 No, that can't happen.
00:28:07 Oh God.
00:28:12 I'm looking, I'm looking over Twitter.
00:28:14 Trying to remember what, what happened this week?
00:28:16 Well, Ben, you said you had some hot goss.
00:28:18 Oh, well you mentioned hot goss.
00:28:20 Maybe.
00:28:21 Okay.
00:28:22 This is a weird, this is a weird story.
00:28:23 This is going to, this is going to sound very bizarre, but yeah,
00:28:26 something happened yesterday that I thought was very remarkable.
00:28:31 So I'm, I'm on Twitter and I'm, and I'm looking at, um, it's a,
00:28:36 I passed by a tweet from that account who I've mentioned before,
00:28:39 who I really like.
00:28:40 Posadist Trapgod, who lives in Atlanta and he's like a,
00:28:44 you know, communist and he's out counter protesting,
00:28:49 uh, uh, some like, it's some like pro-maga, uh, uh, uh,
00:28:55 what's the protest, right?
00:28:57 There's like some pro-Trump protesting going on in Atlanta
00:28:59 and he's out like, you know, he's on the other side.
00:29:02 He's counter protesting them.
00:29:03 He's like taking pictures of them.
00:29:04 He's tweeting about it.
00:29:06 And then I see another, uh, a tweet from someone else.
00:29:11 I don't remember who, uh, from, that's the same, uh, the same,
00:29:16 uh, protest from the other side.
00:29:18 Like this is someone who's on the, the MAGA side of it.
00:29:20 They're tweeting about the Atlanta protest.
00:29:22 So I, I look and I look at the stream and who do I see in this
00:29:30 protest, uh, this pro-maga fucking thing.
00:29:34 Uh, uh, in the stream, then, uh, then May.
00:29:39 Oh.
00:29:40 Oh.
00:29:41 You got, yeah.
00:29:42 May's there with Ethan Rao from the kill stream.
00:29:46 Oh, of course.
00:29:47 And I watch, and I, and I watch, and I watch for a while as
00:29:51 she and him stand in a crowd listening to white nationalist
00:29:56 Nick Fuentes give a speech about how the governor of Georgia
00:30:00 must overturn the vote and how President Trump must be
00:30:04 president not just for four more years, but for life.
00:30:07 Uh, and they all clap and cheer.
00:30:09 Uh, that's so bizarre that you happen to find that on some
00:30:13 stream.
00:30:14 That's, that's the really bizarre part of this to me.
00:30:17 It's, it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, you know, I had to, I had to
00:30:21 mention it because I was like, wow, that was a journey.
00:30:25 That was a journey that I went on.
00:30:27 Yeah.
00:30:28 I wonder what they were doing.
00:30:29 That's weird.
00:30:30 That's really, really weird.
00:30:31 Like I could imagine if you asked them, they're just like,
00:30:34 oh yeah, we just wanted to see like laugh at it, you know,
00:30:37 have a bit of fun.
00:30:38 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:30:41 You know, how distance ourselves.
00:30:42 No, no, no.
00:30:43 They were cheering.
00:30:44 They were cheering.
00:30:45 Oh, what do they say on that show?
00:30:46 Maga hats and everything.
00:30:48 Disavow, they'd say disavow over and over again, I think.
00:30:51 Which, which, um, yeah.
00:30:54 Like, are you a hundred percent sure this wasn't just some
00:30:57 lookalike?
00:30:58 100 I am 100% sure Ethan did you know that did you recognize Ethan Ralph as the Ethan man, okay
00:31:06 Yeah, and I know yeah, I know who he is. I would like to see this
00:31:10 Anywhere to look
00:31:14 It was the kill it was the kill stream
00:31:17 Which is on D live I think so the footage was from the kill stream that you saw. Yes, okay
00:31:25 Yeah, that was the that was the stream that it that was linked
00:31:29 Yeah
00:31:30 the
00:31:31 I don't know. I don't I don't know what else to say about it other than to
00:31:35 A mention that that occurred
00:31:37 You weren't kidding about the hot goss that is that is hot goss. It's wild, right?
00:31:42 Well, just like because if I was reading a work of fiction and this was a plot point
00:31:46 I would say that is contrived
00:31:49 And like kind of silly that this is how something developed
00:31:52 Um, but then here we are
00:31:54 It doesn't doesn't surprise me as much as maybe I wish it did
00:31:58 You know
00:32:00 She she was all on that Ralph retort thing
00:32:04 For a while. Yeah

00:36:34 So kip kip kip from rfck did a meme
00:36:38 Or did a did a uh, uh, uh, what's it called like a ranked a tier list of sandwiches
00:36:42 I saw this on twitter
00:36:44 And I was like I I have to do I have to do my own sandwich tier list now
00:36:49 Uh, I had to yes, I saw that on germa's stream
00:36:53 There's a lot of sandwiches. Oh, I don't think we use you saw you saw my tier list on germa's no the the sandwich thing
00:37:00 He did it
00:37:02 And he had a lot of opinions
00:37:03 I've realized from from from watching that that I don't fucking know sandwiches
00:37:08 There's all of these things that I'm just like what the hell is that?
00:37:12 Like ingredients I understand but like named sandwiches of a specific kind. I just I just guess I don't know so much
00:37:19 There were a bunch of sandwiches that I had never had before actually there were a lot like the
00:37:24 Tied for the biggest uh group in my tier ranking was never had it
00:37:29 Uh, let me read you all the sandwiches. I've never had okay. You croak. Miss. Do you have an image so we can follow along
00:37:36 Oh, um, yeah, sure. Um
00:37:39 If you insist uh, here, I'll post it in general. I'm bad at listening to this visual
00:37:43 I'm bad at listening to bed saying no all the sandwiches. I've never had croak. Monsieur croak. Madame
00:37:50 torta ham bone puree
00:37:52 Monte Cristo tonkatsu
00:37:54 bocadillo
00:37:55 liverwurst cucumber tea
00:37:57 Italian beef and kentucky hot brown
00:38:00 Are these like common sandwiches because I've I I don't know apparently I'm uncultured. I don't know anything about anything
00:38:06 I have not I
00:38:08 I thought a bocadillo was just a Spanish word for like a sub sandwich
00:38:12 I didn't think it was a specific kind of sandwich. Um, Italian beef
00:38:16 I just I may have had that and just not known I was having one because that sounds pretty common
00:38:21 Like you didn't know that the beef was Italian, but it was beef
00:38:24 I I don't know it must be just a certain things on it
00:38:28 I don't fucking know and I and I know of Monte Cristo
00:38:31 I've heard of Monte Cristos and I've heard of tonkatsu's but the other ones I've like
00:38:35 I've never heard of a cucumber tea sandwich or a Kentucky hot brown
00:38:39 um
00:38:40 Mate, I don't I didn't know about these the croaks the croak
00:38:44 Uh couple croak. Monsieur and croak. Madame never heard of it. I
00:38:48 The biggest struggle for me was where to place egg salad
00:38:52 Because on some days egg salad is definitely in the nice category, but other days it's in the good category. I don't know
00:38:58 Egg salad in my own personal opinion is an abomination, especially if it's being eaten in public
00:39:03 You're a fucking mute. You're a fucking mutant
00:39:06 Egg salad underrated egg salad is highly underrated the scent of egg salad pervades
00:39:11 Everything it has ever been around. I wish I could smell an egg salad right now
00:39:16 This if I know you don't when I smell egg salad I just get hungry and I think I'm jealous. I wish it
00:39:22 It's not scrambled. It's hard. It's hard boiled and chopped. It just doesn't smell good though. It's powerful
00:39:28 Yeah, yeah, I I don't know. That's just something I like but I like it sort of like the smell sort of I don't know
00:39:34 Like I I enjoy an egg egg salad sandwich is just sort of like comforting
00:39:39 You bite into it and it's like a sandwich, but it's also like you're having an egg
00:39:43 I
00:39:44 Love it. I like in my personal opinion
00:39:46 I'd I'd rather just eat an egg or eat some bread like I don't need these things to come together
00:39:52 It's such a strange. It's such a non-strange thing to combine though. It's not like like putting an egg salad sandwich
00:39:58 I don't know. I chocolate ice cream with uh, like
00:40:02 roast beef
00:40:04 I love like I love deviled eggs and an egg salad sandwich is basically just a deviled egg sandwich because it's just
00:40:10 Oh gosh, you brought up deviled eggs and now I need to tell something. Oh gosh. Okay. All right, so
00:40:16 Has have you watched spongebob?
00:40:19 Sure. Yes, like okay, so there's an episode in that where spongebob talks about how
00:40:24 um
00:40:25 There's like there's a pinata with deviled eggs in the episode
00:40:29 Okay, and at one point I was talking with my wife about different types of eggs and she brought up deviled eggs
00:40:34 And I was like I can't believe people put those in pinatas
00:40:38 And she's like
00:40:40 She just looks at me and she's like
00:40:43 What do you mean?
00:40:44 And I'm like, you know people will put them in pinatas at parties. She's like you mean in spongebob. I'm like, what are you talking about?
00:40:51 That's a thing people do and I had this gap of knowledge where I had seen it in spongebob forgot
00:40:56 It was from spongebob and thought people were putting deviled eggs
00:41:00 In pinatas
00:41:02 Dude, I can't believe they put february eggs in pinatas. I mean it's not as gross as this, but it's like if you read that like reddit
00:41:11 That reddit that reddit post about like
00:41:14 My boyfriend like literally will not wipe his ass because like he thinks you're not supposed to or something
00:41:21 What?
00:41:22 Like he thinks it's like gay or something like he genuinely is like no guys don't wipe their ass like come on
00:41:28 Oh, of course
00:41:30 Yeah, but anyways, so like I she made fun of me for that
00:41:34 Well, she still makes fun of me for that and rightfully so because I don't know
00:41:37 Yeah, absolutely. I can't believe we put deviled eggs in pinatas
00:41:43 That's pretty wild man. I like that a lot actually
00:41:46 Yeah, anyway, sorry for derailing the sandwiches, but you said deviled eggs and I had war flashbacks
00:41:51 I don't know. All I had to do was um, all I wanted to do was draw attention to the underrated egg salad sandwich. Um
00:41:59 if there's an
00:42:00 Another one on here is the Thanksgiving
00:42:02 My my lowest my lowest ranking for sandwich is I'd still eat it because like there's no sandwich that I think is like bad
00:42:12 I'm surprised PB and J is down and I'd still eat it obviously because to me like
00:42:16 I don't know PB and J. It's a classic. It's a gooder
00:42:20 Put it in my mouth. It's fine
00:42:22 Like, you know, it's fine
00:42:24 it's not
00:42:27 I think it's I think it's odd how like one of the most classic sandwiches is also like the only sweet sandwich
00:42:34 Like every like every other sandwich is savory. PB and J is sweet. It's like it's it's actually like
00:42:40 Completely different from every other sandwich on this list. That's a good point
00:42:44 Yeah, if you think if you really think about it, it's fucked up like it's fucked up
00:42:47 Like it doesn't it is the only other the only other sweet sandwich I can think of is like those weird little
00:42:53 Rolls where they put cream cheese in it. Do you know what I mean?
00:42:56 Um, they're disturbing. They're disturbing creations. They're more like these fancy little like finger sandwiches
00:43:02 Little rolls that they put cream cheese in. Yeah, it's not good. It's like I don't I don't know what you're talking about
00:43:08 Okay. Yeah, it's it's a basically like a circular looking one and they have like cream cheese rolled into it and then
00:43:14 Sometimes there's like fake cherry shit in there. It's not good like a crepe
00:43:20 Um, you know what? Yeah, it's pretty much like a crepe, but it's like a piece of fancy bread and it's not very good
00:43:26 Okay. Okay. Okay. Is it like a rolled up crepe that's been sliced into like a spiral?
00:43:31 Yeah, kind of like that. Okay. Okay. Like you could you could put it that way. I don't know if I would call that a sandwich
00:43:36 But uh, I don't I got you. That's a good point. Yeah, I'm not sure if it it shouldn't qualify as a sandwich
00:43:41 It's an abomination. I mean this brings this obviously this recall the the ancient is a hot dog a sandwich chart
00:43:49 Everything is the sand of the sandwich alignment. Yeah, I I've seen that
00:43:53 What what Ben what is your stance on hot dog specifically?
00:43:59 um
00:44:00 Because I can't yeah, it's it's a yeah, it's a sandwich. Okay. I would agree the
00:44:04 It depends on the
00:44:07 in the merriam webster's dictionary defines
00:44:10 specifically includes a clause in the definition of sandwich that means it can include um
00:44:17 A filling between a split roll and that's what a hot dog is. It's a sausage in a split roll
00:44:22 So yeah, it's yeah, but like you wouldn't call a kebab a sandwich or a or a hero
00:44:30 um
00:44:31 I don't know. Uh, well that well. Yeah, because that's not a split roll. That's a that's like a wrap
00:44:36 Or a pocket so split so the roll has to be something that you could turn into a sandwich if you split it all the way through
00:44:44 although
00:44:45 Well, no, it is it is a sandwich even if it's merely split. I mean like like in terms of like bread
00:44:51 Things like you can't wrap the bread around the sandwich. It has to be cut into
00:44:56 I don't know. I honestly like I'm a bit I'm a bit of a of a sandwich anarchist myself
00:45:01 I kind of think that like uh, yeah, maybe a maybe a euro or a or a pita pocket is a sandwich
00:45:08 I'm I'm inclined to feel like it is even though I can't give like a robust
00:45:13 explanation
00:45:14 Is a pizza pop a sandwich then?
00:45:16 What the fuck is a pizza pop like a like a pizza you don't know what a pizza pop is
00:45:21 Like a pizza pocket like a piece. Yeah, yeah, pizza pocket pizza. I mean you said I envisioned like a frozen like popsicle
00:45:30 Okay, uh
00:45:33 No, no, I think
00:45:37 What makes
00:45:38 What makes it what makes a pita what makes a pita or a euro feel like a sandwich to me is the fact that it's assembled
00:45:45 Whereas like the fact that like the the the pocket is like sealed in a factory
00:45:50 Makes it feel less like a sandwich to me. What if you made it at like home though?
00:45:55 How you you can't yeah. Oh, yeah, you can I've made them homemade before man. What it's good shit. Yeah
00:46:02 So wait, what what is a pizza pocket? Is it like a pizza where the bread is on both sides?
00:46:08 Yeah, it's kind of like it's it's um
00:46:11 Like the crust exterior and then inside you like put the stuff like a calzone
00:46:17 Um
00:46:17 Kind of you know what now I need to figure out the technical definition of a pizza pocket
00:46:22 We could we could I mean we could go down the sandwich rabbit hole
00:46:26 I mean, yeah, we could just talk about sandwiches for the rest of this is fucking is fucking ravioli a sandwich
00:46:34 I mean the little sandwich is basically just just several sandwiches stacked on top of each other. Yeah
00:46:40 A spaghetti is actually just a bunch of like it's just like a
00:46:44 Sort of three-dimensional. That's where I have to that's where I draw the lines
00:46:48 because
00:46:52 No, but because the the topping the the filling the meat or whatever you want to call it
00:46:56 Can go under and over and all over around the bread
00:47:01 carbohydrate in this case
00:47:03 spaghetti
00:47:05 Um, and I feel like that definitely changes lasagna counts
00:47:09 Um, I didn't say that you said that
00:47:12 Okay, I'm trying to think if lasagna counts because like maybe if
00:47:16 If the top of the lasagna and the bottom of the lasagna are both like
00:47:21 Uh, you know the lasagna sheet
00:47:24 And then you know all of the inside is like the stuff
00:47:28 You can't you can't really have like lasagna with all of the the the pasta right at the bottom
00:47:33 It wouldn't be called that
00:47:35 You know
00:47:37 Well, what I'm saying is what I'm saying is that lasagna is like
00:47:41 Noodle it's like carbs filling carbs filling carbs filling
00:47:45 So it's basically just it's basically just a multi layered sandwich, right?
00:47:51 Um, I don't know I would say that that that checks out just because of aesthetic things like it's it's usually like a flat
00:47:59 plane like a bread
00:48:01 Um, yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly
00:48:03 But spaghetti I think just because of the fact that it's not intended to be eaten
00:48:08 Um in layers. It's just a mulch. It's just a squelch
00:48:12 Of all the ingredients you you you eat it however you like if you put a if you get a ham sandwich
00:48:18 And it's like little little ripped up bits of bread and little ripped up bits of ham and you eat it with a spoon
00:48:23 Is it still a sandwich? I don't think so
00:48:26 Uh
00:48:28 There's actually people are debating this online apparently I just looked up is lasagna a sandwich
00:48:33 This is a years a years long
00:48:36 Uh odyssey like we're we'll never we'll never get to the bottom of it. Nobody somebody somebody said something interesting
00:48:42 Which is impossible pick it up with your hands and eat it
00:48:45 If you're very cool, you can like me if you if you have if you have to eat it with a knife and fork
00:48:50 I think that's I I do I agree. That's that's kind of disqualifying. Yeah
00:48:54 Yeah, I'll give it. I'll give it that so yeah
00:48:58 Uh pasty what are they called?
00:49:01 What are they called so that I can tell you what they are because they're a british thing pasty
00:49:05 um, oh
00:49:07 Different these are uh yorkshire past no it's not yorkshire
00:49:12 Okay, it's like a it's like a it's like one of those jamaican like beef pockets
00:49:18 A pasty god these look good. Yeah, they're like cheese and beef in a in a thing
00:49:24 And it's intended to be eaten with your hands. It's like a work of food. It's like an easy way to have food on the job
00:49:30 That's the other day. The other day I I learned about the worst british food. I've ever heard of um
00:49:36 It was a spotted penis. Is that the one?
00:49:41 Wait, what no the spotted dick is a thing and people. No, no, no, I don't I I've heard of that
00:49:46 I don't know what it is. Um, no what I am talking about is the this is so fucking funny
00:49:52 Um, um, I'm scrolling back because I remember who was talking about okay, okay
00:49:57 It is the the vegan kebab
00:50:00 The what the weekend the vegan kebab
00:50:04 What does it consist of okay?
00:50:07 This was like a you here. I'll post the video. This is so good. Um
00:50:11 There's a whole video on it. Okay. Yeah, there's a whole okay
00:50:14 I guess I guess vegan I guess vegan is like the name for some part of britain or some like some person from a certain
00:50:21 From we can we can
00:50:24 All right, um
00:50:25 Is that up? Is that a place? I I don't recognize it, but I guess it is. Um
00:50:30 Is is it what it looks like? It's just a pie but with a bun burger bun
00:50:35 It's a meat pie if it's a it's a sandwich, but the filling is a pie. That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen
00:50:42 Yeah, like a pie is basically already a sandwich
00:50:45 A pie is already like meat encased in bread. It's not even a kebab
00:50:50 The kebab needs a wrap for it, doesn't it?
00:50:53 I
00:50:54 I thought if you like skewered through see yeah, I thought that a kebab
00:50:58 I thought that a kebab was about it's about the meat on the skewer that you carve off like I thought it was
00:51:04 It was the meat shish kebab. Wait kebab. No, no, no, no. I'm not I'm not saying like a shish kebab
00:51:09 I'm I'm talking about the sandwich kebab, but I thought what called what was what made it that was the sliced meat
00:51:15 Um that comes from the big piece of meat on the skewer
00:51:19 I think well
00:51:20 I'm not a I'm not greek and I don't know these things
00:51:24 But I think I've had like kebabs
00:51:27 Where the meat inside is you know chunkier
00:51:31 But I don't know it probably probably true donna kebab is is the one where you slice the meat down
00:51:38 Yeah, that's the the german one right um the
00:51:42 the the
00:51:44 Oh, that's that's
00:51:46 Well, then okay. Well, if that's if that's not if the meat from the if the sliced meat isn't what makes the kebab
00:51:53 Then I don't know what it does because then it just seems like it's just a pocket
00:51:57 I think that that that literally is the the thing because it's like the the bread
00:52:02 I think it comes from Greece the the or turkey or you know that area of the word Mediterranean
00:52:07 They use that type of bread the flat bread and they slice it open and put stuff in it and depending on what the type of thing is
00:52:14 It's either like a donna kebab or a shish kebab or
00:52:17 Because you're not you're not really supposed to eat the shish kebab on a stick
00:52:21 You're supposed to put it into the bread and eat it like that
00:52:26 This this video is so fucking funny. It's like he
00:52:30 Like he's not even speaking english
00:52:33 He like okay
00:52:34 They he goes to this place and he orders the vegan kebab and it's just a fucking pie on a bun
00:52:39 And then he asks for like another thing the smack barm pee weight
00:52:45 And and the smack barm the smack barm pee weight
00:52:49 Is literally it's just like it's like a chicken patty
00:52:53 And the and the pee pee wet
00:52:56 In smack barm pee wet what it is
00:52:59 It's just the the liquid runoff from like cooked peas
00:53:04 It's just like the the soup of a pea soup just the liquid part just kind of splattered on to the chicken
00:53:10 patty
00:53:11 And so a smack barm pee wet is like a chicken sandwich with like gross pee water splattered
00:53:18 And he says it's like
00:53:20 It looks disgusting. What do you say?
00:53:22 What do you say? Oh, and then he gets his full order and he's like uh a vegan akimbo with a smack barm pee wet
00:53:27 And i'm like that's not you're not allowed to say these things. You're not allowed to talk like that. You should go to jail
00:53:32 Oh for sure. You should be fast-tracked to the nearest attention facility. Fuck yeah
00:53:37 I I I kind of would would eat that though because like I I love like mushy peas with with with things like class food
00:53:46 It's just it's good. You know, I looks disgusting, but I would I probably I'm talking shit
00:53:51 I'm talking shitty. I don't actually think it sounds that bad. It's like a sandwich topping
00:53:57 It's just but uh, but uh, it's just but it what's gross about it is just that it's called pee wet
00:54:03 Pee wet pee wet a smack barm pee wet with a vegan kebab
00:54:08 And then it's like oh, oh a scouser tries the vegan kebab like ah, yes a scouser
00:54:13 And then he takes a bite and he's like no, that's what I call a buddy and I'm like, ah, yes the scouser tries the buddy
00:54:21 So many layers it just keeps going. I don't know what any of these means. I know I know all these things
00:54:27 I
00:54:28 Know like I know that in America in America. We have the chip buddy, which is a kind of sandwich
00:54:35 So I'm assuming that a buddy is just a sandwich
00:54:38 Oh, yeah chip buddy is is yes like you put chips a lot of fries into between bread and eat it
00:54:46 I'm not too fond of it honestly because it's like it's too much carbs and not enough anything else
00:54:51 But maybe if you put a lot of vinegar and salt and stuff on
00:54:54 Um
00:54:55 Yeah, I've I've had one before I thought it was weird
00:54:59 It kind of reminds me of like spaghetti sandwiches, which I think is another like bizarre thing that people do
00:55:04 Uh, I've never understood that
00:55:07 Spaghetti sandwiches. Yeah, what is this world? I'm learning of it's it's it's weird because it's it's it's it has the same problem
00:55:15 As the week in kebab, which is just that like why do you need to double up? Why do you need to carve like it's like the point
00:55:22 The point of spaghetti is that it's a carbohydrate vessel to carry the flavor of the sauce to your mouth
00:55:27 Yeah, like no like before I was being facetious saying that they should go to jail
00:55:31 But these people do need to be stopped and I don't know what like I don't know what we should do about it
00:55:35 I just know that something must be done
00:55:38 So how has the government let this go on how put pusatist pusatist trap god when he was at the atlanta protest
00:55:46 He was like filming like the the mag of people chanting and he he said like you know
00:55:50 I'm sorry for the tone shift, but it just reminded me
00:55:52 He said like you know, there's a lot of people here who will never be reached
00:55:55 And it just begs the question of what can be done or what what must be done
00:56:00 And so that's not a change in tone. This is very pertinent
00:56:03 This is the same thing. Okay
00:56:06 What can we do? I've tried to make a spaghetti sandwich before and I found it's it was it's hard
00:56:12 Like it's hard to keep together like it doesn't it's not an actual thing
00:56:16 I think the idea like I think the idea the idea is like oh you have leftover spaghetti
00:56:22 So it's like, hmm. What can I do with this? I'll make a sandwich out of it same with like the thanksgiving sandwich, right?
00:56:26 It's like, oh, I have leftover thanksgiving shit. I'll put it on a sandwich that makes sense to me
00:56:31 That actually can make a sandwich. It's not my favorite sandwich. I don't I don't love that
00:56:35 But like at least it works spaghetti. I don't know
00:56:39 I don't like that you're even beginning to rationalize this right? This is how people are radicalized
00:56:43 It's it's like having it's like having like, I don't know like steamed rice in a bun. It's like why
00:56:50 It's yeah, I don't
00:56:52 It's just eat the rice. It's perverse. It's just eat the rice. Just eat the right. Just eat the spaghetti. Just eat the spaghetti
00:56:58 Yeah, yeah, you don't you don't need to do any favorite pie on a farm
00:57:03 You don't need to do anything with spaghetti to like like with leftover. You just eat it
00:57:08 If I see a single fucking in the comments section defending this holy shit
00:57:14 It's fucking broke
00:57:17 Someone's
00:57:18 um, there was a
00:57:20 There was a guy there was a guy who worked at my college
00:57:24 I think we I think people called him the batman because I think he like
00:57:28 Because I think he wore like batman shirts and stuff. Um
00:57:32 he worked at my college a
00:57:34 food dining hall
00:57:35 and he would like
00:57:37 Basically, he was cool and people liked him and you could ask him for like a special
00:57:41 Sandwich he had like he had like sort of a special sandwich that he'd make
00:57:45 um
00:57:46 Which was essentially just a chip buddy, right?
00:57:48 But it wasn't it wasn't on the menu
00:57:49 Like he would he would put fries and like barbecue sauce and like chicken on this thing
00:57:53 And it was like it was like his sandwich and if you asked him for it, he'd make it for you
00:57:56 And it was pretty good, but like, you know, I don't know fries on the sandwich
00:58:01 I mean like it just feels like like makes sense to me
00:58:04 Although I will put I will put potato chips potato chips on the sandwich are good
00:58:08 But like that's because like that ends it like a different texture because it's crunchy
00:58:12 Yeah, like I like I'm like a like a like a tuna melt
00:58:15 It's a bad idea to do it
00:58:16 But it's it makes some sense right because you already have like you'll have fries with a burger
00:58:21 So like who's to say that you can't just combine them, you know, you know, you know
00:58:26 There's a large there's a large segment of the population
00:58:30 Uh, I would describe it as a cult. Um, who believes in the in the myth that like
00:58:37 Dipping your french fries and your milkshake is good
00:58:40 And I don't subscribe to that view at all. I think that that's
00:58:44 Fully unscientific pseudoscience. Uh, I think that it's dangerous rhetoric that it is it is dangerous. I'll give you that right?
00:58:52 Yeah, that's for sure. Um, are you are you guys with me on that? I haven't tried it
00:58:57 I don't think ever because I've heard people say it and I'm always like no no no fuck off
00:59:00 Wait, I've I've tried it and like it's not terrible
00:59:03 Like it just tastes exactly like you think it would and like it's it's whatever. Wait, I missed what we're talking about
00:59:09 I was too busy looking at red man
00:59:12 Dipping your french fries in your milkshake. Oh that I feel like a lot of the time
00:59:18 Yeah, it's just you don't get enough of the milkshake to really get any of the flavor of it. It's just sort of wet. Yeah. Yeah
00:59:25 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and it makes your french fries soggy and the last thing I want is a soggy fry
00:59:30 That's that's true. I mean sometimes sometimes fries are just soggy because there's so much oil on them and they're still fine, but
00:59:38 I think that's a problem in and of itself though. Like if somebody passes me some soggy fries
00:59:43 I'm gonna give them a little look and I won't kill them the first time but if it happens again
00:59:47 Well, some some establishments fries just kind of come out soggy or and to be honest, I don't I don't always mind it
00:59:54 Fair enough. Like I guess it can be okay
00:59:56 Like um, um five five guys has some of the best fries out there for like a fast food place
01:00:03 And those fries are not particularly crispy. I mean, I also wouldn't classify them as soggy though
01:00:09 I would say they're soft. Like like now. Yeah, they're not they're not soggy. I like I like them a little bit malleable and not like
01:00:15 Snappy, you know what I mean
01:00:17 Okay, now I'm with you on this. I understand what you're saying. I like it both ways. I like it both ways
01:00:22 Um, um, but I do like the crispy ones. Um
01:00:25 Like I'm extremely salty too. I have like
01:00:28 A very high salt tolerance
01:00:31 Uh, I I I eat I eat the dust at the bottom of a bag of pretzels
01:00:36 Uh, oh what the
01:00:38 Are you are you okay? Are you gonna go into shock?
01:00:41 Are you drinking salt water one time?
01:00:45 Make sure you drink water if you drink that much salt
01:00:48 I'll tell you one time. I got I got an over my head. This was is in um, I was living in northern california
01:00:54 And I went with some friends. We we were hanging out in sacramento one time
01:00:58 And we went to a ramen place. They were like, oh, there's this there's this nice little rustic ramen place
01:01:03 Let's go there. I was like, okay. I've never been to a ramen place before
01:01:05 So I went there and I'm looking at the menu and I'm looking at what I want in my ramen and I see an option
01:01:12 On the menu. That's like you can ask for extra salt
01:01:16 In your ramen and I'm like, oh, oh, and I'm like, oh boy. I love salty stuff like like so, you know
01:01:22 If if if anyone's gonna want extra salt in their ramen, it's me like that's for me
01:01:27 So I got it and uh, oh fucking boy
01:01:31 I
01:01:33 Like like let me remind you I eat the I eat the pot the the the dust at the bottom of the pretzel bag
01:01:39 I could not eat this ramen. It was so the broth was
01:01:42 Inedibly salty. I tried I tried to like mask the the salt with like I tried to put tons of like hot sauce and like oils
01:01:50 And stuff in it and just like drown it out with other stuff and I couldn't do it
01:01:53 I couldn't finish it. It was like it was the saltiest thing. I've ever I've never had something that was so salty
01:01:59 I could not eat it before but this was it
01:02:02 It was disgusting. Maybe maybe because why why do they offer this?
01:02:07 Maybe they're just more used to it because they have soy sauce and that's quite salty
01:02:11 Maybe that's very normal to have a lot of I feel like this was like saltier than just drinking straight soy sauce
01:02:17 People have like died from drinking straight soy sauce. So don't really don't try that at home kids. That's the real
01:02:24 I didn't finish it. I didn't finish it and I think I I don't I think I'd have died if I did it was
01:02:30 I was like
01:02:32 Man, I don't know. I don't know man
01:02:35 There is a level of saltiness where it turns into an assault on your senses like like your body rejects it
01:02:41 Yeah, so I like
01:02:44 That's sad, you know, it was sad
01:02:47 It was uh, uh, actually actually
01:02:49 I
01:02:51 Rather than just eating it straight now when I had when I finish a bag of pretzels
01:02:55 I save the dust and then I use it as a topping
01:02:59 I use it as like as like
01:03:01 Yeah, I use it as salt because it has that pretzel flavor
01:03:03 So if like I sprinkle it on like a grilled cheese sandwich or something that's and then like it just kind of imparts a little
01:03:08 Sort of pretzely flavor to it. Yeah
01:03:10 Whoa
01:03:11 Yeah, it's pretty good. That's that's pretty hot. Oh, it's kind of like saving. It's kind of like saving your bacon grease
01:03:16 Right. It's like, you know, why why waste this I can cook with this later
01:03:20 Dude, did you see that I made pretzel bread pretzels?
01:03:26 They the other day I posted it on twitter or instagram or somewhere
01:03:31 I I was I was proud of them because they they looked really jank, you know, I couldn't roll the dough in the right shape
01:03:37 But it was a really fun
01:03:40 different way to cook bread
01:03:42 because it involved a vat of bubbling
01:03:45 a cauldron of like stuff
01:03:47 and
01:03:48 The the idea to give it that pretzel taste
01:03:51 You know, you make a bread you got dough and yeast and it's very normal
01:03:55 But then you have to before you bake it
01:03:57 Dunk it egg wash, right? No, you have to dunk it into a bubbling cauldron of of like baking soda
01:04:04 Like a lot of baking soda and you keep it in there for like 20 seconds
01:04:08 And then you take them out and then you put them in the oven and they taste like pretzels. They're like big pretzel bread things
01:04:14 It sounds awesome. Oh, it was really good. I saw the image of them that you had you had made and I thought they looked pretty damn good
01:04:20 They they were the best bread I've ever made. I thought they got their flavor from an egg wash. No, that's that's it's
01:04:26 Wouldn't you know it's the baking soda and apparently that's how bagels are made as well
01:04:30 Oh
01:04:31 You dunk a dunk a ring into a thing
01:04:34 And then you cook it and it comes out with a nice taste
01:04:40 Nice, I'll also try that that sounds good. Yeah, look up recipes. It's not that difficult
01:04:44 aside from like there was a moment where
01:04:46 Um, I put the baking soda in and the water was too hot and it was sort of a bubbling too much
01:04:50 And it sort of frothed everywhere and I had to clean that up. It was an explosion
01:04:55 Um, I make um, but yeah, it was it was good when I
01:04:58 Whenever I fry whenever I fry chicken
01:05:01 I make the I have a I have a big like tubs of oil that I reuse
01:05:06 And I'm always I'm always going overboard
01:05:08 I'm always going overboard with the oil and cooking it and it like it's always like right about to bubble over
01:05:14 And I have to like stand there and watch it cook and use a little ladle to like continually stir the top of it to pop all the bubbles
01:05:22 So that because it's like like right at the top
01:05:23 I'm like no and I'm like blowing on and I'm like, please don't boil over
01:05:26 Please don't but and I'll just stand there and just like whisk it around like whisk around the top of it and blow
01:05:30 And it's like no no no because um start a fucking grease fire
01:05:35 Um, I don't know why I don't just use less oil, but I I don't know I always find myself
01:05:41 I always find myself in this predicament
01:05:43 I always wanted to try like deep frying something, but it's like
01:05:48 You have to get a lot of oil to have enough dunking space
01:05:51 And I don't feel like putting a big thing of oil there. What am I going to do with that afterwards do it again?
01:05:56 Where am I going to keep it you?
01:05:58 You save it you you know you put you you let it cool
01:06:01 And then you just pour it like you buy like a big like a big like two gallon oil
01:06:07 thing which costs like six bucks and then you um, yeah, you could you cook it in a pot you boil it in a pot
01:06:14 And then you let it cool and you just put it back and you use it again later
01:06:16 Maybe you maybe you strain it so it doesn't have like, you know
01:06:20 A residue from whatever you were cooking in it. Okay, maybe I could make doughnuts. That would be a cool idea
01:06:26 Well, that would be good. Hell yeah, you know, I'm I am looking at these pretzels
01:06:31 And I do think an egg wash an egg wash would make them darker
01:06:35 So if you're looking to get that
01:06:37 The recipe didn't call for it. I think some of them I didn't keep in the the the mixture for long enough
01:06:42 It's mostly aesthetic. It's it's mostly aesthetic. Oh for the shine. Yeah, maybe
01:06:47 Yeah, to get to make them darker and shinier. Yeah, they tasted perfect and I sprinkled the salt all of them
01:06:53 They look good. They look really good
01:06:56 Definitely gonna do that again
01:07:00 Very nice. I've been watching um, I've been watching this uh, this uh, uh cooking youtuber
01:07:06 his name is uh
01:07:09 His name is my name is andong. You ever heard you're seeing him? No, I don't think so. Nope
01:07:15 He he made um, he he's german. He did a pretzel video. He did um
01:07:22 He he he doesn't he doesn't he does like some more normal stuff and then he does some more out there stuff like he made um
01:07:29 He made like uh, uh chips out of
01:07:32 Other foods by which I mean like he ordered like a burger and fries
01:07:37 sushi and a doner kebab and then he took each of those dishes and like
01:07:43 pulverized them in a food processor and like made them into a paste and dehydrated them to make chips out of them
01:07:50 like
01:07:51 Yeah, to make like a chip a crunchy chip that was made of like a doner kebab
01:07:57 He wasn't that impressed with the burger or the or the kebab, but apparently okay
01:08:02 He he he takes the sushi one and he and he and he takes a bite of it
01:08:06 And then he looks directly at the camera and he I can't you won't see my face
01:08:09 But he goes like oh these like and I was like, oh my god. I'm so excited for you and dung
01:08:14 I'm so happy for you that you that you did it
01:08:17 You've made a discovery. Apparently the sushi like the chip tasted like sushi, which is very funny
01:08:23 um
01:08:24 Yeah, yep. Yep. Yep. He made um, he did one that's like
01:08:28 read like
01:08:29 Making a Naruto ramen like ramen that looks exactly like the the ramen that Naruto orders in the show
01:08:35 Uh, yeah, you know, there's stuff like that big north
01:08:39 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The idea of making like crisps or chips out of of like anything
01:08:45 Reminds me of that one channel that makes knives out of everything and anything. Yeah, I love watching this occasionally
01:08:51 They're just part of my recommended. I haven't but this sounds extremely interesting. All right. So there's this guy
01:08:58 um
01:08:59 I think he lives in the old the the east and he doesn't speak but he he does these videos where he's like
01:09:07 Gets, uh, you know a concept for making a a knife that can be super sharp the sharpest
01:09:13 X knife in the world. So it would be like the sharpest
01:09:16 Gelatin knife in the world the sharpest chocolate knife in the world
01:09:19 He'll make whatever it is and there's you know, there's no commentary. There's no annoying like hey guys, welcome to another video
01:09:26 It's just like yeah, silence silent like
01:09:30 Like process of like all of these things he's doing. I'm like, what where's this going? Where is this leading?
01:09:35 This is such an adventure to see how you make a knife out of like the bottom of an aquarium like how do you do that?
01:09:43 I've seen him make the one that someone linked me was a sugar
01:09:47 He he makes one out of like candy. Yeah, and and he and he doesn't just make the knife
01:09:52 He makes it and it and he makes it come out so sharp that at the end he like slices paper with it
01:09:57 Oh, he does like show tests of what he's doing with them after the fact
01:10:01 Well, he'll he'll often unmake he'll often unmake them afterwards
01:10:04 Like he'll he'll make it and then he'll like melt it down again
01:10:07 Because like i'm sure i'm sure that a knife made of sugar doesn't like keep you know
01:10:11 Yeah, I wouldn't keep
01:10:12 Wait, though the weirdest one I saw was he made one out of fire
01:10:17 Oh, by which I by which I mean that he he made it
01:10:20 Well, he made one out of soot
01:10:22 From a fire like he burned shit and then he held a pan over the fire
01:10:26 And the pan like collected soot in it and then he collected the soot and like
01:10:32 Yeah, like boiled it down and like reduced it and like crystallized it into a knife and like cut shit with it
01:10:39 That's so unique. I I wish
01:10:42 that
01:10:43 Like that's one of those ideas you hear and it's like it is brilliant that this this person came up with this
01:10:48 Um, and you can't help but hope that one day you'll come up with an idea that is so esoteric and brilliant
01:10:55 It's I mean, what yeah once you have the but by the idea
01:10:58 Do you mean just like making a knife out of anything like just the idea of making a knife out of anything and then pushing it that far
01:11:05 Yeah, like once I mean once you have the idea and you start like
01:11:09 Hmm, what can I make a knife out of once you have the idea like the basics are just like
01:11:14 How can I how can I like collect any given material and mold it right? Yeah, and I'm sure some materials work better than others
01:11:22 It's like as long as you can turn something into a paste or a liquid
01:11:27 Like like any any sort of solid that you could turn into a liquid you can and then you can solidify it
01:11:32 You can morph it into a thing. Yeah, it's like
01:11:35 it's it's like the the
01:11:39 It has like elements of like weapon building tutorials or like those not tutorials those those videos where like
01:11:45 Um, they they restore like super rusted old things
01:11:49 But also cooking like cooking experiments as well because a lot of them are food
01:11:54 It's just sort of all of the things he he makes it uses all the tools
01:11:59 It's just very well, that's what makes it like to me
01:12:01 That's what makes it so brilliant is you're combining so many different ideas into one thing
01:12:05 That's so weird that I never would have thought to ask the question of it
01:12:09 But as soon as you say hey, this guy makes knives out of anything. I'm like, what now I want to watch this
01:12:15 This sounds fun
01:12:16 Oh, oh my god
01:12:18 Oh my god, there it is one of the one of the wait. Is this the right?
01:12:22 Is this the yeah, there it is one of my never had it sandwiches the hamon puree. I was just looking
01:12:27 My name is andong has a video where he makes a hamon puree
01:12:31 Perfect. I'm probably I'm probably pronouncing that wrong because it's french and I don't know how to how to
01:12:35 How to pronounce french words, but damn damn the guy's got a fucking answer for everything
01:12:41 The hamon brulee. There you go. Hamon
01:12:44 hamon
01:12:46 French is
01:12:47 Whenever I don't even like I don't even want to try to pronounce like any french word because it seems like every time
01:12:53 I see a french word. It's like, oh, okay
01:12:54 I have some idea of how it's pronounced and then when I hear it pronounced
01:12:58 It's like, oh, you just like ignored half the letters or just like added some extra ones in like I don't I don't fucking
01:13:03 Understand this at all the thing with french that annoys me is is that you know sometimes
01:13:10 The s is not spoken, but some other times it is and there's no I feel like way to tell
01:13:15 I feel like
01:13:16 I feel that way, but like I don't think it's just s's I
01:13:19 There's lots of things but the s is always like at the end of words you you always assume
01:13:23 Oh, if it ends in any s it's like air and rather than s
01:13:27 But sometimes that's just not the case and I just I look like it looks stupid sometimes
01:13:34 Very stupid very stupid. Yes
01:13:36 Uh
01:13:40 Yeah, pronouncing french
01:13:41 I am horribly useless at it despite the fact that here in canada. I was forced to do it for
01:13:48 Uh, like all of elementary school and I'm just useless. That's right. You're canadian
01:13:52 Yeah, I learned nothing. I learned nothing from french. All I know all I knew was how to ask to go take a shit
01:13:59 I learned um
01:14:00 I I studied spanish like all through high school like middle like middle school and high school and college
01:14:06 Like yeah, I could speak it kind of okay
01:14:09 And then like after college. I never used it and I've like I've completely forgotten like
01:14:14 I mean I can kind of still read it and like have love like I
01:14:18 I generally know like what's going on often, but like I can read it and I can kind of understand it
01:14:24 But like if I had to speak it I'd be like
01:14:28 You know, I because I would like forget the words like until I heard them. You know what I mean
01:14:33 languages are so hard
01:14:37 It's such a
01:14:39 Like you need to know you can't just learn it because uh, you need to use it all the time or it just
01:14:46 There's some serious attrition. It goes away
01:14:49 Yeah, um, all you need to do is just say uh, I can I could speak a little and they'll be like, oh, okay
01:14:55 I could speak a little bit of polish when I lived in poland, but now I remember like
01:15:01 Half a dozen words and like yeah an expression and that's it. Yeah
01:15:06 I I just learned like I just learned a bunch of like kind of functional phrases and words to like get around like
01:15:11 Yeah, you ask people directions like say hi to people, you know, whatever. Yeah, I only know um
01:15:18 Uh, I know one polish word or phrase which is dobranos for I think dobranos dobranos
01:15:26 What is that? I think it's I'm pretty sure it's just like
01:15:30 Good night, and it's the only thing I know so whenever I see my wife's polish family
01:15:34 I just wave and say dobranos no matter what the situation is and and it's like morning and they all shake their head like
01:15:41 Oh, it's that fucking
01:15:42 That's fucking uh, this stupid outsider that westerner. Yeah, they they all turn to each other
01:15:48 They do the they do the Picard hand in head gift
01:15:53 Oh, yeah, oh this actually leads to a this leads to a fun story that you might enjoy
01:15:58 Um
01:15:59 So back when I was in high school. Well, I'm still an idiot, but I was particularly an idiot in high school
01:16:04 Uh, and that was where I I met my wife and I was away somewhere on a little trip
01:16:11 Wait in in high school. You said yeah in high school. Okay. Okay. Uh, so then I was
01:16:15 Wait, wait, how wait, how old are you okay? Because schooling is different like how old are you in high school in canada?
01:16:23 Um, like you you go there until you're like 17 or 18
01:16:26 Okay, all right. So same as america. Yeah, same same thing. Um, so I was away and I had gone to this sort of like
01:16:35 world war two
01:16:38 shop
01:16:39 Like it was kind of weird because at first it looks like a museum thing
01:16:42 But there is a weird amount of just paraphernalia where I'm like, I don't know who's buying this stuff
01:16:48 um, so then I told my wife for a joke. I was like, oh, I bought you a poster of uh
01:16:54 Of of the big Adolf
01:16:58 And it's so I'm gonna bring that back to you and I just said it as a joke right so then I got home
01:17:04 And I was like, okay. Well now I need to follow through so I printed off this really shitty picture
01:17:08 The big Adolf. That's what they called him. That's what they called him back in his old college boxing day
01:17:14 So I I had a picture of him and underneath I put the words. I don't know how anyone could not see you
01:17:20 And I brought this I brought this to her house and I I like just started dating her
01:17:27 I don't know what possessed me to do this. It was really dumb because her family's polish
01:17:33 So I I take this in and I haven't folded up. I'm like, don't show this
01:17:38 Uh, like to anyone right? This is a stupid edgy joke
01:17:42 and
01:17:43 She's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, and as soon as she walks inside her mom's like, oh, what's that you have there?
01:17:46 And she takes it looks at hit and then stares at me and says we don't like that man here
01:17:56 And I'm like, no, no, no, no, I should I should think not
01:18:00 This is a stupid joke. Like it's nothing more than a stupid joke
01:18:05 So then I'm sweating and I go home and I'm talking talking to her and then you're and then you're you're you're
01:18:10 You're then then girlfriend. I imagine it's like, oh, yeah, sorry about my sorry about my hitler loving boy
01:18:17 Well, no, she was like and the parents like, oh that boy the hitler boy
01:18:22 And she was telling me she's like, no, no, no, it's fine
01:18:24 She knows it's just like a joke and I'm like, are you sure?
01:18:27 Like because I don't blame her if she's upset with me. This is like the first time I've met her
01:18:32 Um, yeah, yeah, but you know those nazis there was carrying a bunch of women pictures of Adolf looking at him
01:18:40 Oh, yeah, it's so uh, it's important to them as I'm talking to her a bunch of people
01:18:45 laughing in the background because I was talking to her online and uh
01:18:49 I'm like, oh, what's that?
01:18:51 So then she goes and apparently her mom was showing all her friends this picture because her mom thought it was hilarious
01:18:57 That I'd bring that into the house
01:18:59 But she didn't want to like let me know she thought it was funny because I guess she didn't want to encourage this high school bullshit
01:19:05 um
01:19:06 So that was just a very good way to meet someone. So kids don't very good. Don't do that
01:19:12 Don't make the mistakes I've made
01:19:14 So it was like it worked just
01:19:16 When you meet your your your significant mother's parents, I would say try to avoid
01:19:21 Hitler
01:19:22 You know try to avoid jokes like that on the first time
01:19:25 It did kind of work though because I think she thought it was funny and was like this this kid
01:19:31 You know this guy
01:19:33 Yeah, polish polish fascists are are pretty awesome actually
01:19:39 Oh, gosh, they have they have cool iconography
01:19:42 Because I mean poland just has like cool iconography. They have like the royal eagle and stuff
01:19:47 Yeah, and I've I've seen like some old like polish like fascist literature that it's like
01:19:52 I've seen like they have they have those symbolized things with like the axe
01:19:56 They have like big axes with with like eagle wings on them and stuff. It's like that's that's pretty cool. That's pretty like um
01:20:03 Uh, that's that's kind of warhammer 40k. I'm sold like I I could get into this actually now that you say that
01:20:09 Yeah, a shitload of the fascist
01:20:12 I don't know images and stuff looks like something on a warhammer
01:20:16 Yeah, yeah, yeah, they do for sure. Which is probably purposeful probably warhammer wanted them to like
01:20:21 I don't know maybe look like that or maybe it's just that
01:20:24 You know, you know the thing about fascists you gotta hand it to them
01:20:29 You you just you just gotta hand it to them. Well, they really like painting litter. That's all I'm figurines
01:20:35 What have you gave you see you seen that you seen that drill tweet?
01:20:39 uh
01:20:40 no the
01:20:42 Famous famous drill tweet is like is like uh apologies for my last tweet regarding uh isis
01:20:50 You do not under any circumstances gotta hand it to them
01:20:54 Oh, I do remember that I think I have that in one of my favorite in that fucking drill tweet book that I bought
01:21:01 Oh, okay. Well, I hope I would hope it made the cut. It's a classic. I enjoy that book quite a lot. It's very silly
01:21:09 Just to open it to read tweets printed on paper
01:21:14 I'm looking I'm looking at
01:21:18 Okay, there's a there's a there's a like a fascist polish group called the o n r
01:21:22 And I don't know what that stands for but but their logo their logo is like it's the stylized um
01:21:30 Arm holding a sword. It's kind of neat. It's kind of a neat logo
01:21:35 That looks like an esports team. That looks like a fucking minecraft team
01:21:40 It is no that oh my god, you're right. It looks like minecraft
01:21:46 And when they when they go to battle with their minecraft team, they would say get ready to take this l
01:21:52 I
01:21:55 Hope you'll show it on the screen. Oh, no, what are they talking now?
01:21:58 I'm thinking of a rally with people with diamond armor on
01:22:03 I I guess the it stands for
01:22:06 oboats
01:22:07 Not a dovo
01:22:09 Eradi Eradi colony
01:22:12 National radical camp is is what it means in English. Okay, the national stands for oh, no, we're radical
01:22:19 Dude, I want to go to a radical camp
01:22:21 Is that when I'm a kid when I'm a teen? Yeah, it's like it sounds radical. That's that's really that's yeah. Why not?
01:22:28 Why not? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm doing like sick kickflips and stuff like
01:22:32 base based as fuck
01:22:36 If only they were actually like that well that fucking was a journey
01:22:41 Hmm said if only they were actually like that
01:22:44 Yeah, then I'd agree with all of that points
01:22:50 I can't I can't believe
01:22:53 I can't believe I didn't see before that. It's just minecraft. It's a diamond sword
01:22:58 I love that
01:23:03 Uh
01:23:04 Lord when we do these shows we usually go we chat for a while and then we go to voicemails. Um
01:23:11 Do you want to hang around and listen to voicemails or uh?
01:23:15 Yeah, I'd be down to listen to voicemails if you'll if you'll have me for your voicemail times. Sure. Um,

01:23:24 I don't I don't know give what do you what do you think?
01:23:27 um, I mean

01:25:46 Canny an investor praise slimer made pizza chan mega slime slime hearts. Yeah, these are very nice
01:25:52 Imagine imagine wearing that that new los angeles city flag patch like on your fucking shoulder
01:25:57 Imagine like walking around looking like that. I I kind of wish I had one
01:26:03 I bought one
01:26:05 Because I do I do have a winter coat that I could put it on
01:26:10 I might just I mean you're just just because you're gay. Well, maybe I'll toss you one
01:26:14 Yeah, I'll fucking I'll fucking toss you you might get one
01:26:18 You may if you're a good boy in your Christmas stocking. Oh, I can't wait
01:26:26 Yeah, um
01:26:28 Well, Santa's gone mad. Well, let us go mad with power fucking
01:26:33 I just I just want to okay. Can we talk about how Santa's just evil?
01:26:37 Go on like, okay. This is the thing that's really bothered me forever. Um
01:26:42 So this whole idea of being naughty or nice, right?
01:26:46 Yeah, you tell kids this and then it's like well Santa's a cop Santa's a fucking cop
01:26:50 Well, Santa is all about that thin blue line
01:26:52 You could argue that Santa is the thin blue line between naughty and between society being naughty and society being
01:26:58 I mean, you're just building the argument even more because I didn't even consider that
01:27:02 Like Santa so you tell these kids, right? Like if you're good, Santa will bring you presents
01:27:09 If you're bad, you don't get presents
01:27:12 In my mind eventually down the long run this equates morality with the amount of money you have so that your parents can buy you things
01:27:21 Oh, I see what you're saying and that like as a kid if you genuinely believe this right like imagine little timmy's been so nice
01:27:27 He's just a great kid
01:27:28 But his parents don't make that much money and he's like I got like one little thing
01:27:33 And then this other dipshit in the class is like my parents bought me a million things
01:27:38 Bought me a fucking car or whatever and it's like damn that rich kid, but it's supposed to have been so much nicer than me
01:27:43 Yeah, I don't like it. I don't I've never you know, santa. I think we need to kill him
01:27:48 I mean, I wonder I wonder
01:27:51 Do you kids kids more likely to believe in santa like think that that's it?
01:27:54 santa rewards the status quo
01:27:58 Mmm. Yeah, like I'm not I'm not necessarily making the argument that kids are operating on this level
01:28:03 I'm just saying that in retrospect looking back at it. I'm like, you know what santa's kind of fucked up. Yeah, definitely
01:28:10 I mean, I
01:28:13 I legitimately wonder like
01:28:15 Maybe kids do have that thought like I just wasn't nice enough that I didn't get the fucking I didn't get the playstation 5
01:28:22 Unlike, you know, josh
01:28:24 josh who fucking uh gave me a swirl at the other day
01:28:28 Uh, he he got it though like damn. What am I doing wrong? Yeah, and I feel like it would be much nicer like I don't know
01:28:35 Just to know, you know, if you know your parents are scraping by if they're open with you about like we don't have that much stuff
01:28:41 I feel like you would be more grateful if they're like we bought this for you because we care about you
01:28:45 It's as much as we can give you not like that big fat fuck gave it to you
01:28:49 I think there are parents. I think I've heard of people who are like
01:28:54 Yeah, we don't tell our kids that santa got them stuff because it's kind of fucked up and like, you know
01:28:59 We want them to know that like, you know, we got them these things because like, you know, we love them
01:29:04 Yeah, and I learned like real quick that santa was a total fraud because uh,
01:29:08 My my parents would always like leave out
01:29:11 Like this was when I was like four or five. They leave out cookies being like
01:29:15 Santa's gonna come and eat the cookies and then they leave out a giant carrot for the reindeer and my dad would eat the cookies
01:29:21 And the the carrot would never get eaten
01:29:23 And they were always just like, well the reindeer wasn't very hungry and I looked at my parents and I was like
01:29:28 Fuck off with your bullshit. Oh, okay. Okay
01:29:32 Why would they do that? Because I was just fun. They don't care, right? They didn't actually want to support even this guy
01:29:38 Okay, okay, okay, but like if the if the scheme is like we're gonna put this thing out
01:29:42 So so he'll you know, so it looks like santa like ate the cookie and gave the reindeer the carrot
01:29:48 Why would you leave the carrot? Why even bother with the carrot if like you're just not gonna eat it and you're just gonna leave it there
01:29:53 Like why even bother? It's a mystery. But uh, yeah, I guess they just didn't care. They probably figured it was kind of funny
01:29:59 That's nonsense. It's like, oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm
01:30:02 It's like if you know, you're not gonna eat the carrot
01:30:06 I don't I don't get it
01:30:08 Santa's weird. There was also like factions when I was in
01:30:12 The younger grades like grade one between, you know, as kids start to realize that this is just not real
01:30:18 Um
01:30:19 Then like certain kids we get very passionate about like guys
01:30:22 You're being duped by the system santa's fake and the other kids would be like, how dare you speak against my worldview?
01:30:29 Um, and like they would get into legitimate fights over this. It was very funny
01:30:34 Preparing them for the future
01:30:37 Yeah
01:30:40 They got to learn they got to learn to hate their fellow man
01:30:42 Eventually you have to learn sooner rather than later. There are dividing lines and one of those dividing lines is labeled ho ho ho
01:30:49 Begs begs the question of what is to be done?
01:30:55 We got to collect all these santo lovers all these radicals and all of these, uh, I don't know
01:31:01 weird like pizza sandwich
01:31:03 Fuckers
01:31:04 And these yeah, these radical these radical, uh, these radical anarchists who say that a choco taco is technically a sandwich
01:31:11 Which is just a lie. That's a lot just just criminal and punishable
01:31:16 Um by a week in the in the stocks
01:31:19 Oh, man
01:31:21 Let's uh, let's do let's do voicemails. Let's do voicemails. Let me let me pull these up. Um, uh, okay this

01:32:16 Immoral and shouldn't be done. I am not going to listen to anybody. I love circumcision
01:32:21 I hate I hate short nerve endings. I hate sexual pleasure
01:32:26 If any if any others are about circumcision, I'm just not gonna listen. I'm gonna talk. Yeah, what what is going on with circumcision?
01:32:34 Nothing nothing. What nothing is happening. No, no, no, no, no
01:32:39 Just watch the last 10 weeks the last 30. Oh, yeah, what's the last several months of I I have like watched
01:32:45 a bunch of them
01:32:47 And then I always see like I haven't finished them or I'm watching them on a video
01:32:52 And then um people will be in the comments like circumcision talk and I'm like, okay
01:32:57 I guess just you know, they're just they're just they're just they're just this josephi
01:33:02 You're a you're a fucking goof. You're a fucking funny man and a goofball and you're a real comedian clown, mr
01:33:07 I like them. I like I like them, you know, I like his I like his name
01:33:11 Yeah, I like out of his job. Yeah, I like circumcision too. If we get one more here's here's the thing
01:33:16 If we get one more where I'm gonna open the the new like pcp
01:33:22 um forced circumcision clinic
01:33:26 They will be circumcised live on air
01:33:29 Wow, and if they're already circumcised, I'll just put some forescales
01:33:33 We will implement a like mandatory circumcision policy in the uh in the in the
01:33:40 But in the in the pcp in the pcp prison
01:33:43 So like that guy that I sent to prison last week for asking asking about circumcision too much
01:33:49 We will circumcise you we have the ability our only circumcised people allowed on the podcast
01:33:55 Um, they will be okay because I was just about to say like I've got a knife ready. I'm prepared
01:34:02 if uh
01:34:04 Stand by we we'll we'll we'll be using that very soon. Okay, because I could be the first one in the circumcision clinic
01:34:10 I'm ready for
01:34:11 You know, do you want to do all the forced circumcisions on our political prisoners?
01:34:16 I think I should be the recipient of a forced circumcision. Uh, you're too into this. You you were waiting for us to say this
01:34:22 No, he's too. Well, he's too willing. It doesn't that's just doesn't have the same. I mean don't no don't circumcise me
01:34:28 No
01:34:30 Doesn't feel the same. Well, okay. I mean I guess we could if you insist
01:34:36 Next next voicemail is called defund the police, but I am confused. Am I dumb?
01:34:44 Okay, three two one go
01:34:47 Okay, so if there's a hostage situation the police are supposed to come and like help resolve that
01:34:52 Or if like I my house gets broken in two I call them and they help resolve that issue
01:34:55 And there are a bunch of other essential functions that we give them the power to
01:35:01 Fulfill but then they abuse that power and are racist and bad
01:35:05 The current consensus is like, oh, we should just defund the police because they're
01:35:09 Causing the problems here
01:35:11 And like it sounds like it would be great
01:35:14 But my question is about those essential functions like either a we just leave them unfulfilled once we defund the police
01:35:20 I've heard this question so many times
01:35:23 And then what's to stop them from being just as racist and bad as the police are
01:35:27 It seems like it's just kicking the can down the route. What's to stop who from being as racist?
01:35:30 Am I stupid? Is this just an obvious answer to this question that I'm dumb and missing?
01:35:35 Please elucidate
01:35:38 Okay, man
01:35:41 I don't know why I have to answer this question. I feel like you could google this but uh like
01:35:45 The point is the point is to reduce the scope of the police by by defund them
01:35:50 You reduce their scope the point is that they fulfill too many functions like yeah
01:35:54 We should still have some form of law enforcement and like civil protection in the case of like, you know
01:36:00 Someone is like actively committing like violence somewhere. Yeah, like
01:36:05 It's it's not that like it would be reduced to zero
01:36:08 It would just be like, you know defund it
01:36:10 Restricted scope
01:36:12 Greatly the problem the problem is we have over we have over policing in america and probably in other countries as well
01:36:18 The way to think about it is if you expanded their scope to say include the military
01:36:23 The police would have access to a lot more dangerous weaponry
01:36:27 um
01:36:28 That they could just use or like, you know, just give
01:36:32 That they would have too much extra stuff and it would cause even more problems to defund them is to limit the powers that they have
01:36:40 To to you know that the corruption
01:36:43 Would yeah, if there is corruption would you know cause problems the end the end goal
01:36:49 The end goal is not that like literally nobody is there to respond when like someone
01:36:56 When the occasional shooting spree happens, you know, yeah, because there's always that that's sort of like
01:37:02 safety net for police officers that do terrible things they get off lightly
01:37:06 Because everyone this they've got too much
01:37:10 Sway over the justice system that they can get their buddies off
01:37:14 Scott free and it's like they shouldn't be able to have that
01:37:18 Like I don't know too much about this shit, but I feel like there's problems with self-regulating systems
01:37:23 like if the system of law itself is supposed to look after itself
01:37:29 And check and balance itself that kind of poses like
01:37:32 I don't know a problem of who's actually going to keep things in check
01:37:37 Yeah, yeah, the police the like the police like
01:37:41 Is is
01:37:42 To a large degree they are they regulate themselves and like, you know, I think there's been a lot of people calling for like
01:37:49 civilian review boards need to be you know
01:37:52 They like the police need to be more accountable to groups outside of them
01:37:55 And I know I know that they are to a certain extent accountable to those outside themselves
01:38:00 But like, you know the argument is well, it's it's it's not enough, you know
01:38:05 Uh
01:38:07 Overpolicing is the problem like your argument isn't to let anarchy run wild in the streets
01:38:11 Well, the good kind of anarchy. Maybe okay. There we go
01:38:16 Um, the next next one is called a punished sweeper
01:38:21 I like the title of it. I don't I don't know what to make of it. Uh, three two one go
01:38:26 Okay, like fucking so many weeks ago. I said in this voicemail about minesweeper.online

01:39:35 And like to break it. He needs to like have someone replace him
01:39:39 That's my hypothesis. Yeah, maybe maybe this guy's got some stocks and minesweaver online dot org or whatever it was
01:39:47 You know, okay something something sinister is definitely going on. There's something a fuck
01:39:52 There's no way that anyone would just make pzp voicemails to call in to tell us to go to minesweeper.com or whatever

01:44:11 it's the the last voicemail I remember before before this was uh,
01:44:16 I think the jewish question guy
01:44:19 Oh, yeah
01:44:21 Yeah, some of you guys need like
01:44:24 A discord server or a youtube channel or friends or something
01:44:28 Um, you complain about voicemails and yet you make one curious checkmate. I'm very intelligent
01:44:35 I don't care about, um
01:44:38 I heard about a guy who's like talking about persona five or something. I didn't hear that. I just heard that
01:44:42 Yeah, that was a nightmare
01:44:44 That was almost as bad as circumcision go outside or like go join like a discord server go join rfck or something like
01:44:51 Yeah, join join a cult do do anything maybe go buy a maybe go buy a pin. Hmm. Hmm. Think about it
01:44:57 somebody called in just to tell you about persona five
01:45:01 There was a guy who like every week for a while he would make like one or two voicemails just like being like
01:45:07 Okay, no guys like I really want to explain how much I like persona five and then you'd call back week next week
01:45:13 Yeah, we just wouldn't and he'd be like all right. I didn't I didn't really explain it clearly
01:45:17 But what I really like about persona five is
01:45:20 Just make a youtube video god damn it. That's right like a hundred thousand percent more use of your time better use
01:45:28 That's true. That's probably somebody who's talked to all their friends about and all their friends are like
01:45:32 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. Maybe I won't and then they they're desperate and they're like I need I need to know
01:45:38 I've had an impact as far as persona five playing is concerned in this world and sir
01:45:43 Sir, if you are listening or watching this, I have played persona five and let me tell you I will carry the mantle
01:45:49 I will call in every week to try to explain
01:45:53 You know no that under that underrated classic persona five like no one appreciates it. Nobody's played it. It's it's ridiculous
01:46:02 And I and I gotta I gotta do something about it
01:46:05 Uh, uh next next one is called let's go
01:46:09 Three two one go
01:46:12 Hello, and welcome to Bay Saints by Iluzon. You begin with the saga of st. Benedict the need who could
01:46:18 Benedict or benfort horn was a fifth century rich family italian man who got sent to be educated in rome
01:46:25 St. Saint ben is christ was rome disgusting
01:46:29 Everybody just fucking sucking
01:46:31 Drinking and eating all the time. That just wasn't our boy ben's vibe at all
01:46:36 But it is that rather than have a good time hating himself
01:46:40 He decided he'd rather stay a god pilled dumb dumb minimalist in a small village in the middle of nowhere
01:46:46 Well, dad was pretty good living until he got accidentally got famous in the dumbest way possible
01:46:54 Crash when the ceramic sea benedict repaired it, but everybody was like
01:46:59 You
01:47:01 Everybody knows you don't just repair ceramics
01:47:05 He must have prayed it together
01:47:08 Well, and so they started simp and you young ben 24 fracking seven
01:47:14 We're like
01:47:17 He got good at it
01:47:19 He saw only a single path leading to everyone finally leaving him alone
01:47:25 Become a cave living need deep in the heart of the mountains
01:47:31 Um
01:47:32 Did did did I miss something? No, no, I think it's on just wanted to
01:47:40 Deliver us this this the life story of st. Benedict with some with some dramatic flair and and he did it
01:47:47 Yeah, he did it. Wow. Um
01:47:50 Yeah
01:47:51 Well, now now you know everyone. I hope I hope that was uh educational for you
01:47:56 I hope yeah
01:47:57 Okay, next one next actually next one is called. Hmm end me
01:48:04 Hmm
01:48:07 Sounds familiar
01:48:08 Sounds sounds like what I say to myself in secret
01:48:12 Uh three two one go
01:48:17 Ha ha pee pee poo poo stinky
01:48:28 Voice grail voice grail I'm thinking no fuck no no
01:48:35 Stupid stupid. Okay next time next one is a urban dictionary
01:48:41 Uh, there it is. Wait one sec. There it is. Okay three two one go
01:48:47 No one truly misses the topics. We all just really miss urban dictionary. Please bring urban dictionary back
01:48:56 Uh, it was the best part of the pcp. You know what that's fair. You might be like well, but but but episode the
01:49:02 The best part of the pcp is this part and you're wrong. It was always the urban dictionary
01:49:08 You've been lied to episode 23 is just okay
01:49:13 um
01:49:14 The monsters and dreams and voicemails and all this other bullshit. It's all an illusion
01:49:20 You have to go back to the days of urban dictionary. I I agree. You know, I agree
01:49:24 Uh, uh the the idea of like we must have a topic. I never made much sense to me
01:49:29 But we have lost something valuable
01:49:31 In the in the losing urban dictionary. So let me let me let me fix this
01:49:36 Urban dictionary defines circumcision as oh god
01:49:41 To remove a male's foreskin
01:49:44 So that's pretty straightforward. I hope I hope I hope I hope everyone is amused
01:49:49 Wait, are there surely there's some other definitions? There's usually like secondary ones, right?
01:49:55 Are there any funny ones? No, no, wait
01:49:58 um next one
01:50:00 What happens when ignorant parents are jealous of their beautiful child?
01:50:05 Uh followed by a barbaric and cruel act of cutting someone's foreskin off his cock
01:50:09 It's what needs to be illegal except for really really bad medical conditions parents should not have the right to circumcise their son
01:50:15 We circumcision ourselves. We've punked ourselves by listening to yet another opinion
01:50:23 Wait and then and then this this this one has a dramatic reenactment
01:50:26 American christian father when our son is born. We're gonna circumcise to him
01:50:32 American christian mother. I agree. He needs a circumcision
01:50:36 American christian father it would be painful at least he won't remember any of it when their son is born
01:50:42 He got circumcised doctor cut stick baby
01:50:47 The baby cried for two weeks
01:50:53 There okay, can I ask how did circumcision come up the first time?
01:50:58 Just it was just someone asked in a voicemail
01:51:01 about
01:51:02 What we thought about it little did they know what people didn't like my answer what they had done
01:51:08 Yeah, it's
01:51:09 They know they they they know what they fucking did
01:51:13 um
01:51:14 next one is
01:51:16 wha-ba-ba-ba
01:51:19 next
01:51:21 This one's on thin ice next one is called is digi fuda
01:51:25 Oh three three two one go
01:51:29 Assuming digi still has her pymosis cock would she be considered fuda at this point
01:51:34 Just need to do some research so I can get all my galboro tags in order. I
01:51:39 uh
01:51:40 I
01:51:41 I feel like this is gonna
01:51:44 I feel like maybe we should ask digi's opinion about this. I don't know if I feel comfortable saying yes or no
01:51:50 Yeah, I don't this people have different definitions for it. I usually only think of it as like a fake porn thing
01:51:57 And not a real thing
01:51:59 But maybe people do identify as that. I don't know
01:52:03 I'm probably some yeah
01:52:07 I'm gonna say that probably is like uh, I'm gonna say what do you what do you think? What do you think?
01:52:14 Hmm pass it back to the leader leave your leave your past back to the viewer leave your comments down below
01:52:21 Next one is called um it is called
01:52:26 Weird baby dick
01:52:28 Nice three three two one go
01:52:33 Okay, so
01:52:34 Ben you asked about my ex's kids weird dick
01:52:38 so he fucking
01:52:40 He was partially circumcised
01:52:42 I did basically the doctor did was cut off like
01:52:45 The top 80 percent of it. So he has foreskin on the bottom basically
01:52:50 And it's just fucking weird looking
01:52:52 What?
01:52:55 Also for digi
01:52:57 It's easier for me at least
01:53:00 to
01:53:01 suck a dick when I don't have to like
01:53:05 Navigate the foreskin with my tongue
01:53:07 Even though that's kind of neat
01:53:09 But docking is pretty cool docking is fucking epic. Um, okay
01:53:14 Okay, so I first I thought he meant that he cut off like the 80 percent of the dick
01:53:19 But I don't think that I think what he's saying is that the doctor
01:53:22 Didn't cut off the entire foreskin
01:53:25 But only like the top 80 percent of it. Oh, I thought he meant like 80 percent down the shaft
01:53:31 That's what I thought too, but I don't
01:53:34 No, I I think I
01:53:36 Because that's because if you cut down the shaft like that's not foreskin. That's just skin. Yeah. Yeah, so that would be a fuck up
01:53:43 So by botch circuit the botch circumcision here was that he's not circumcised enough
01:53:49 So, I mean, I would maybe consider like
01:53:52 Finishing the job at that point. They're in no man's land
01:53:57 Yeah, um, I mean, I'm sure it
01:54:01 I'm trying to imagine what that would even look like. I mean, I'm sure it works fine
01:54:04 Hmm
01:54:06 Just kind of like a flap on the bottom of yeah
01:54:08 Yeah, it's yeah, I didn't realize people had such strong opinions about this because I have like a weird rant
01:54:15 I have told my poor friends that they have to listen to about how I hate circumcision
01:54:19 But like I'm not going to subject you to that. I just wanted to don't know. We've had enough
01:54:23 Yeah, I just I just wanted to let you know that I didn't realize this was such a hot topic among the people
01:54:29 When I remember when Andrew Yang came out and said that like he didn't like
01:54:33 He didn't think that like circumcision should be a mandatory
01:54:36 I remember there was a certain section of the internet was like really excited. We're like fuck. Yeah
01:54:42 Wait, he didn't think they should be mandatory aren't circumcisions
01:54:46 Not well, no, I mean no, what I mean is he said the thing that's like, um
01:54:51 You know like uh
01:54:53 Parents probably shouldn't make the oh, okay. I see what you're saying like that. Yeah, he said that and people were like
01:55:00 Which you know, I'm fair enough. Okay, um
01:55:03 Next next one. Yeah, it's called. I literally hate you awful mic quality
01:55:09 um
01:55:10 3 2 1 go
01:55:13 The voice grail and the voice jail are a false dichotomy
01:55:16 What always happens is someone will make a shitty voicemail and it'll get sent to voice jail
01:55:20 But you're giving these failures attention and almost always they take that to continue their narrative
01:55:26 Whereas the people who get voice grailed often send one good one and leave it at that
01:55:30 It's a negative feedback loop
01:55:31 The answer to this is just to say this voicemail sucks and skip to the next one because we still have fucking losers
01:55:37 Like maga and that voicemail guy continuing to waste everyone's time by sending their self-indulgent shit
01:55:43 Like no one has a sensible mail. They haven't even made a good voicemail to invest us to them
01:55:48 How does it feel that your sad existence is continued because of people like ben platform hate speech saint
01:55:54 And his laziness you're so bad. I wish nate was back just to beat you like jesus christ
01:55:59 You're a fucking loser artist calling onto a podcast full of other loser failure artists
01:56:04 I dread having to listen to you jerk yourself off every episode
01:56:08 No one cares about your previous voicemails and no one cares about the voicemail voicemails. You're making now
01:56:13 You're actively making the show worse
01:56:14 And I just wanted you to know that there was someone that has genuine ire for your existence
01:56:19 Please get a bit ask a real question and stop talking about yourself as if we know who you are
01:56:25 You're awful
01:56:27 Wow that the vote apart from the voicemails the show is pretty good
01:56:30 trans rights BLM gay rights
01:56:34 Good. Bye. I
01:56:36 I thought he was talking about me for a second there. No. No. No. He's talking too bad voicemail givers
01:56:42 Oh, okay, because when he when he because when he when he said like
01:56:45 When he said like you're a fucking loser artist like like a clawing on to his shitty podcast and I hate you
01:56:50 I thought like oh now he's talking about me
01:56:54 He did say going on to a podcast full of other shitty failure artists. So I I you know
01:57:01 I I I feel I'm just gonna assume he's talking about me. Uh, no. No, I you're beautiful. I think this guy
01:57:06 I think he makes a bit. I mean if you did say we're a bunch of shitty failure artists
01:57:11 And that that is why that they call into this show. Uh, how doubly embarrassing I guess is what he was saying there
01:57:18 I think I think he's right in that the voice jail doesn't really serve as an effective punishment of anything
01:57:24 Uh, yeah, I just I just want to be able to say fuck you in a specific way
01:57:29 Do a person. Yeah
01:57:31 Yeah, it's uh, we probably should be a little more selective honestly
01:57:35 Like if like if a voicemail if a voicemail is genuinely bad
01:57:39 And like we voice jail it we probably shouldn't like keep playing. I mean
01:57:44 I I'm I'm pretty lax with my standards
01:57:46 But like, you know, if I think a voicemail is like actually like really brings nothing to the table
01:57:52 I I am trying more to actually be like, hey ellie's are cut this don't
01:57:56 So what so what that means is that the ones that you hear are actually the ones that that meet my standards
01:58:01 So that that should tell you just how low my standards are
01:58:03 ma'am
01:58:05 Um, any anything else?
01:58:09 No, no, okay. That was an adventure though that
01:58:12 The the one comment I have I don't know if it's my place to say this is I don't know if the shitty voicemail people
01:58:18 Uh, I don't know if they care about your eye or for them
01:58:22 Like oh, that's that might be true. You might that's probably it might that might feed them as well, right? You might have accidentally fed the loop
01:58:31 That's all I have to say
01:58:32 There's probably a certain strain of shitty voicemail sender who will take who will take this as encouragement. Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely
01:58:39 It's it's really inescapable. It's an inescapable cycle. Yeah
01:58:42 Um cycle of violence the next one the next one is called irish ninja
01:58:48 Three two one go. I think I know who this is
01:58:53 So you's had the irish samurai on last week
01:58:56 Um, I don't care what kind of gay lore shit is going on. Fuck that guy
01:59:01 That's an offensive stereotype. Terrible accent me and all my homies in the japanese IRA. We're gonna fuck him up
01:59:09 um, my question
01:59:11 What is the most appealing and least appealing accent? I wasn't on the last episode
01:59:17 I do want to say I listened to it and it was anything but irish that guy
01:59:22 It almost sounded Welsh like a like a strange combination of Welsh and Scottish
01:59:27 I was like, this is terrible that you you don't know anything
01:59:31 Well, I mean I I won't defend it too hard
01:59:34 But I will say it was meant to be a a mash-up of irish and japanese was the goal is what it was supposed to be
01:59:42 That was the weird part
01:59:44 There were I I could I could tell that's what it was going for. Okay. Um, okay, but the most and least appealing
01:59:51 accents
01:59:55 I might be a little biased here. I think that one of the least appealing accents is a Providence
02:00:01 Rhode Island accent
02:00:03 um
02:00:04 It's a little bit like a boston accent, but not quite
02:00:08 It has an annoying quirk of like adding r's onto the end of words that don't need them like like
02:00:14 posture
02:00:18 Yeah, I I don't I can't really do a good impression of it, but like
02:00:22 It's not like people from like south boston have like a really strong
02:00:26 Ah, pock the cut like you can really tell the the the providence accent is not usually that
02:00:31 pronounced like it's sometimes hard to identify but like when I hear the when I hear that extra r
02:00:37 I'm like, oh
02:00:39 Um, you guys you guys have opinions. Um
02:00:42 like my my one of my lowest ones is a
02:00:45 A very strong like southern accent. I'm not fond of
02:00:50 at all
02:00:51 um
02:00:53 Well, there's there's different kinds of southern accents
02:00:56 Okay, I might be uninitiated due to my you know being up here in the great north
02:01:02 There's um
02:01:05 I don't I don't really know which is which I've heard people like I've heard people do impressions of like an alabama accent
02:01:11 Versus like a tennessee accent versus like a you know, a virginia accent or whatever and like they're all different
02:01:17 All I know is that there are some
02:01:19 there are some
02:01:21 I don't I wouldn't say that I like love or hate any of them in particular. I think that some of them sound better
02:01:27 When women have them and some of them sound better when men have them, you know, and I'll agree with that
02:01:32 I agree and they don't work as well in the reverse. Yeah
02:01:35 Uh, yeah, I'm trying to think of like ones. I don't like what what accent does sarah palin have?
02:01:43 Oh like uh like oh like I'm like a midwestern sort of uh, like wiskansen like like a kind of wiskansen
02:01:50 I just I just remember being very shrill and
02:01:54 Sharp and I didn't like it
02:01:55 I mean, I know she's alaskan, but I don't actually know if I think she it has like a midwestern like wiskans
02:02:01 Yeah, but yeah, that that's a bad one. That's a pretty bad one. Yeah
02:02:09 I feel like it's less about specific accents and more how accents combine with people's like voice types
02:02:16 Where yeah, you'll hit one where they have this picture like tones their voice combined with the accent. That's just no no good no good
02:02:24 I like I like I like irish accents. Oh, yeah
02:02:28 That's pretty good. Um, I'm trying to think if there's any that I particularly like
02:02:32 irish is good generally
02:02:34 I'm trying to think of like what is they said attractive voices, right?
02:02:39 Yeah, like I don't know
02:02:41 exactly
02:02:44 What what what I think of as like an attractive voice because it's always with a person attached
02:02:51 Right
02:02:52 Even if you've never had you've never I mean you've never had like a
02:02:57 I mean
02:02:58 Surely there have been like people who you you've heard them speak, but you've never
02:03:02 Like garrison keeler has a really good voice
02:03:05 But like I saw that motherfucker like a couple weeks ago. I'd never seen what he looked like before and like holy shit
02:03:10 Do you know who that is? No
02:03:13 garrison keeler is a
02:03:16 He's the like a the end. He's an npr like radio
02:03:20 Guy rate radio personality. He has a he has a very nice voice and he looks like a fucking
02:03:27 He looks like fucking
02:03:30 God
02:03:31 Like down syndrome dwight shrewd. I don't know. Oh, no
02:03:35 You look
02:03:36 I exaggerate but not that much
02:03:39 Yeah, I need to see what that what's this guy's name
02:03:42 garrison keeler keeler is spelled key k e i l l o r
02:03:49 Yeah, all I can think of is like fucking
02:03:52 Like voice sounds and not really accents because I I guess I can't parse american accents, but like
02:03:59 Raven from teen titans
02:04:01 and and like kim pine
02:04:03 uh from the scott pilgrim movie
02:04:06 And and and and and what's her face the girl from b and puppy cat that's sort of like
02:04:11 understated sort of
02:04:13 low-pitched female voice
02:04:15 But that's not an accent. That's just a feeling
02:04:18 Yeah, that's so that's like a like a personality type
02:04:22 I
02:04:25 Is that is that the attractive type to you or the unattractive type the attractive. Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's pretty good
02:04:34 um
02:04:36 I
02:04:39 Don't know. I don't know if I have like a voice
02:04:42 type
02:04:43 Exactly, it just yeah, there's not really one type. It's just sort of like things sound good or they don't
02:04:49 And I can't really attribute that to an accent although some accents are very thick
02:04:52 I don't think any thick accent is particularly like attractive
02:04:56 But I do think a lot of northern british accents are funny and cool
02:05:01 If a voice is too
02:05:04 No, the English I should say a voice can sound like too, uh, uh
02:05:10 Strong there are some voices. I don't know what it is like they voice their vowels too much or like they are too like
02:05:16 There's there's a such a thing as a voice that like sounds too strong and I find it off-gooding
02:05:21 I don't know. I don't know how to explain that but there have been voices. I've heard that I'm like, ah
02:05:26 Ah, it's not what I wanted. Yeah
02:05:29 I don't know anyway
02:05:34 Uh, any should we should we move on? Yeah, I think so
02:05:37 Okay, next one is um
02:05:40 Next one is uh, this one is called. Sorry. It is called. How many do we have left?
02:05:46 Only like two I think
02:05:48 Oh, yeah, literally two the next one is called xx the lore destroyer xx
02:05:53 Uh, three two one go
02:05:57 I gotta make this quick because I never know who's listening to me. I'm constantly being watched

02:07:30 or
02:07:31 We could we could demand
02:07:34 We could basically demand that he make more voicemails by putting him in voice jail
02:07:39 Ah, no, uh, I don't now that the the meta has shifted if that's the case then the jail will be more sought after
02:07:46 There'll people be coming in saying uh, I'm stupid. You hate me now put me in the jail
02:07:51 They'll come back. It's I you say that if that's a shit. I feel like it's always kind of been like that

02:07:59 All right. Look lord destroyer. We will we will we will watch we will be watching the skies
02:08:05 signal
02:08:07 Good good screaming
02:08:09 This is the last one. This is the last one. This one is called cross got my wisdoms pulled
02:08:15 three two one go
02:08:18 I got my wisdom teeth removed a couple of days ago and for the first 48 hours after the surgery
02:08:23 I was actually doing pretty fine, but throughout day three. I've been extremely nauseous and lightheaded
02:08:28 Obviously, I'll feel better by the time you're hearing this but nonetheless
02:08:31 I'm curious if any of you guys have gotten your wisdoms pulled and if so, how was the recovery?
02:08:36 I feel like I
02:08:38 Am I crazy? I feel like I got asked this like not that long ago
02:08:42 I even on the show. I don't think it was on the show, but um
02:08:46 I I had wisdom teeth coming in
02:08:50 And for some reason they said yeah, you can keep them
02:08:52 I was like, oh
02:08:54 Oh, I've all the only like the only situation I've heard of wisdom teeth is that they have to be pulled out
02:09:00 And so when I heard they were coming in I thought that was bad
02:09:04 But no, I just have them now. I just have extra teeth
02:09:07 Well, you just have enough space. You're a you're a good one
02:09:10 I'm I'm one of the bad. I'm one of the good ones
02:09:13 You're a vault
02:09:14 Um, well, yeah, I had my wisdom teeth out when I was like a senior or a junior. I think it was a junior in high school
02:09:22 and um
02:09:24 Yeah, I didn't find I didn't get nauseous
02:09:27 I didn't find the pain too bad, you know, it ached it ached for a while afterwards
02:09:32 But um, I got swollen like my face was swollen for like a week afterwards
02:09:38 Uh, uh, it was very hideous
02:09:40 And it was very cringe because I actually had like a date with a girl
02:09:45 Uh, I don't think she thought it was a date lemal, but I liked her
02:09:48 And then we went and I had to hung it hang out with this girl
02:09:51 Uh with my fucking swollen face
02:09:54 And uh, it was embarrassing. Oh no, um, yeah, so that's that's how mine was. Yeah, you know, I it all worked itself out
02:10:02 I didn't get nauseous from it. Uh
02:10:05 I did get like it was really weird because I got them pulled
02:10:08 And then I was doing like totally fine. I wasn't even sore but for a few nights in a row
02:10:13 I would wake up in a cold sweat like I've never had before like just my body shaking
02:10:18 And I'm pretty sure I was like fighting off some sort of infection, but at the time I was like, it's fine
02:10:24 I'm sure it's fine and I just kind of lived my life and I'm still here today. So
02:10:29 Uh, good luck with your wisdom teeth
02:10:31 I remember like
02:10:33 Not very like like after like the the the teeth wounds had already started healing
02:10:38 I remember at some point like I felt something like
02:10:42 In my the in back there in the teeth and I reached back and I pulled out like a big like hard chunk of something
02:10:48 And I I remember I remember thinking at the time that it was like a piece of bone that they'd left in
02:10:53 But I don't think that was it
02:10:54 I think it was probably actually like a chunk of like maybe blood or something
02:10:58 That had like coagulated it could have been like some healing stuff too because like
02:11:03 At least when they didn't mind they left like little divots kind of and I had to like make sure I cleaned them out very specifically
02:11:10 Yeah, because it would just collect like gross gunk
02:11:14 True. Yeah, I don't know. Um, so I don't know you could probably look forward to like pulling pieces out
02:11:21 Uh, you're basically ruined as a human being at this point. Yeah, it's over
02:11:25 You know with I mean the the the wisdom teeth actually contain many like short short nerve endings that like
02:11:31 Massively increase sexual pleasure. So like, you know, good luck. Good luck having a fulfilling relationship now
02:11:37 At this at this point you're doing it to yourself
02:11:40 You you have been mutilated. You have been mutilated cross. You brought it back around
02:11:45 We've finally enforced for a forced
02:11:48 forced uh, uh wisdom teeth removals in the pcp voice jail by the skin of your teeth
02:11:54 But
02:11:56 That's um, that's it. That's the last one
02:11:59 That's the last one. Oh wow

02:15:10 What about this quote and someone looked it up and they're like, oh
02:15:13 Apparently that's an a.a. Milne quote and I was like no
02:15:16 No, it's definitely it's definitely not an a.a. Milne quote because it's from that movie and that's like way after Milne died
02:15:23 And but then I was like wait a minute
