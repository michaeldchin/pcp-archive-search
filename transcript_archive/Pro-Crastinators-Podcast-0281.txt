00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.
00:00:30 Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:01:00 During the Ben Effort Arc, which is long over, that was sure was a time and place. We're past that now.
00:01:10 Remember when this show had effort and every episode started with like an actual edited segment of like a joke?
00:01:16 No, actually. I think Jesse and Davoo did that a couple times and that was it.
00:01:22 That happened pretty often in the olden times.
00:01:24 We set expectations too high.
00:01:27 It's true. We were still young naive fools who thought podcasts were stupid, not realizing that nobody cares about the presentation.
00:01:35 They only care that something is in their ears in another tab while they're doing literally anything.
00:01:40 They're only half paying attention to what's being said in the first place.
00:01:44 Yeah, I mean, that's me. I understand. I too am a consumer pig who just wants more slop in my trough.
00:01:54 Okay, today's episode, we got two guests. We got Kazi.
00:01:59 Hello, I'm a pony character. I'm Yiffy Snout the Pegasus and I'm here to talk about the pony movie.
00:02:11 That sounds like an OC that would do very well.
00:02:13 I'm not hungover at all. Neither has been.
00:02:18 No.
00:02:19 And we got Crack as well.
00:02:23 Good morning. Oh, man. Oh, man, I'm dying.
00:02:27 I'm trying to bring the energy.
00:02:29 Before the episode, you were doing a bit. You were doing a bit where it's like, oh, I'm going to be so energetic,
00:02:35 but you clearly have blown out all the energy you have already.
00:02:38 He's gotten a lot.
00:02:40 No, yeah. I was giving it all I had. I woke up Harganine. She's real upset about it.
00:02:47 Good you. Good, good, good.
00:02:50 I woke up Ethan to take his microphone, so we're on the same level.
00:02:55 I'm glad that it's ruining not only our lives, but the lives of everyone around us.
00:03:00 The collateral damage of the podcast, just wonderful.
00:03:03 We have to release this episode at 10 in the morning so everyone else can live.
00:03:07 The story.
00:03:09 We were recording in the afternoon and I just think that that's bad because then I spend the morning being like,
00:03:17 well, I've got to record in like six hours and then six hours later, I've done nothing.
00:03:22 My day is basically over and then it's time to record and then I got to do audio editing
00:03:26 and then it's 8 p.m. by the time I'm done.
00:03:28 My day is over. It's ruined fruit fly.
00:03:31 No, we got to get up and I got to get my day going in the morning, same time as lifting.
00:03:40 Same time as lifting.
00:03:41 Yeah, that's fair.
00:03:43 That's fair. When we're sitting around at five in the morning and you drop on me that we have to record in five hours
00:03:49 and I didn't know.
00:03:51 That makes me so sad.
00:03:53 Yeah, well, good.
00:03:57 So this is what we're doing now.
00:03:59 Oh god, we didn't.
00:04:01 Okay, on the count of three, let's say sync.
00:04:04 One, two, three, sync.
00:04:06 Sync.
00:04:07 One, two, three, sync.
00:04:09 Sync.
00:04:10 Oh god, I guess this is just going in the episode.
00:04:12 Yeah.
00:04:13 Fuck it.
00:04:14 Fuck it.
00:04:15 Yeah.
00:04:16 They love it.
00:04:17 Then it's content.
00:04:18 Everyone is fucked.
00:04:19 It is content.
00:04:20 It's inside baseball.
00:04:21 It's candy.
00:04:22 I got some good content right here.
00:04:23 You ready for this?
00:04:24 You ready for this?
00:04:25 Oh yeah.
00:04:26 Lay it on me.
00:04:27 Lay it on me.
00:04:28 What?
00:04:29 You hear that?
00:04:30 The pot open.
00:04:31 The first morning monster.
00:04:33 Here we go.
00:04:34 Yeah.
00:04:35 This isn't just time to do drinking or spying, snapping.
00:04:38 Well, I got my seltzer here.
00:04:40 So we all watched a fucking movie this week.
00:04:44 Yeah.
00:04:45 We watched a film.
00:04:46 It finally happened.
00:04:47 It's finally here.
00:04:48 It's finally here.
00:04:50 The bro analysis community is saved.
00:04:52 The drought of content is over.
00:04:56 It's okay, everypony.
00:04:58 Your TF2 analysis anarchy episodes will continue.
00:05:01 Don't worry.
00:05:02 We're working on them.
00:05:04 Yeah.
00:05:05 Dr. Wolf has content to make content out of.
00:05:11 We're meeting through the rift cafe right now.
00:05:13 We're hanging out.
00:05:14 What are you doing in my analysis channel?
00:05:17 How did you get here?
00:05:19 Wait.
00:05:20 I just remembered the whole fucking commission.
00:05:23 Was it me and Steve?
00:05:25 Kazzy that commissioned you to draw the entire brony analysis TF2 analysis community?
00:05:30 Can we show that image on screen right now?
00:05:33 I'm sure I still have it somewhere.
00:05:36 But yeah, no, give and Steve, they paid me like $80 to just redraw the analysis anarchy
00:05:45 poster.
00:05:46 Don't add anything funny to it, they said.
00:05:49 Just draw it again.
00:05:51 There was no joke except just draw it and we'll pay you to do so.
00:05:57 You were the joke.
00:05:58 Just to make the puppet dance.
00:06:00 You were the punch.
00:06:02 And then we printed it out at like a fucking staples and like on just like computer paper,
00:06:10 brought it to brony gone.
00:06:11 And then I think steel viper like took it and she went up to like all of the, you know,
00:06:18 all the people on the poster and had them sign it.
00:06:21 Someone crossed out who's the guy that did the really bad shit.
00:06:26 Tune Critic Y2K.
00:06:27 Tune Critic Y2K.
00:06:28 Yeah.
00:06:29 Someone like scribbled out.
00:06:30 I drew Tune Critic Y2K and just because like he was on the poster and I was supposed to
00:06:34 redraw it.
00:06:35 So I was like, I'm just going to, I guess he's, he guess he's in it and someone scribbled
00:06:40 it out and I'm like, that's appropriate.
00:06:42 It's, it would be, it would be unfair.
00:06:44 It would be unfair to draw a false equivalence between the rest of them and Tune Critic Y2K.
00:06:49 Yeah.
00:06:50 You know, I think I have a photo of the signed poster and I can get that for us too if you
00:06:55 want.
00:06:57 I just hit my mic really hard.
00:07:01 Maybe I'll edit it out, but if I forget, at least I'll edit it out.
00:07:06 Oh, you know what?
00:07:08 Oh, you know what I did this week?
00:07:10 Speaking of, speaking of hitting your microphone and editing shit out of your recording, I
00:07:15 am going to be, I'm going to be a Tails gets trolled canon.
00:07:20 Yes.
00:07:21 I am the voice, I am the voice of the Dark Lord in the audio books and the Tails gets
00:07:26 trolled audio books now.
00:07:29 And as well, as well as one of the cultists in the scene, in the scene where they, where
00:07:34 they drink blood and get their neutral powers.
00:07:37 It seems appropriate considering you're the voice of the Dark Lord in real life.
00:07:41 Yeah.
00:07:42 It's just when, when they drink the blood and get the Satan powers, the Satan, Satan's
00:07:48 voice basically comes from nowhere and just says like, Hey guys, here's the deal.
00:07:52 You got to use your powers and you got to not get emotional or else I'll kill you.
00:07:56 Okay.
00:07:57 Good luck.
00:07:58 Bye.
00:07:59 And that's my line.
00:08:00 Congratulations.
00:08:01 I can't wait.
00:08:02 I'm so excited.
00:08:03 I'm so excited for that to come out.
00:08:06 Ben, I got to tell you listening to the PCP, like a nightmare.
00:08:10 No, I actually do it sometimes, believe it or not.
00:08:13 No.
00:08:14 But like listening to it is.
00:08:15 When you need to pick me up, you're just like, I need to feel better about myself.
00:08:17 Yeah.
00:08:18 You know?
00:08:19 Well, no, that's not even true because listening to it is really just like a hearing of retelling
00:08:23 of my own life because I see Ben like literally every other day.
00:08:28 So every single like thing that Ben does, every time Ben does anything, like I also was there.
00:08:35 And so listening to the podcast is just me hearing about what I did that week.
00:08:39 Listening to the PCP is like journaling.
00:08:41 Yeah.
00:08:42 You know, this is why, this is, wait years ago, this is why I kind of like stopped listening.
00:08:46 This is why I stopped listening to Digi Brony After Dark to the side channel because I just
00:08:51 lived in Trixie's house and I was like, well, now I don't have to listen to your content
00:08:57 anymore because like it's just a hearing someone talk about things that I already heard you
00:09:02 tell me about.
00:09:03 Yeah.
00:09:04 It's just my life.
00:09:05 Exactly.
00:09:06 That's what this podcast is.
00:09:07 Like actually.
00:09:08 Yeah.
00:09:09 Yeah.
00:09:10 Think of how far things have gone listeners.
00:09:11 I know.
00:09:12 They used to live in the same house and now they want to kill each other.
00:09:17 What a strange tale.
00:09:18 I mean, those two things can happen at the same time.
00:09:20 What a twist.
00:09:21 What a twist.
00:09:22 That was the beginning of the end.
00:09:23 That's not even that uncommon of a thing to happen.
00:09:25 It's not.
00:09:26 When you stop listening to the side channel, that's the beginning of the end.
00:09:29 Oh, absolutely.
00:09:30 For any friendship.
00:09:31 You realize that they're not like a super content creator, God, they're actually just
00:09:37 a human being is boring.
00:09:39 Where's the horse cast, huh?
00:09:42 I want more of that.
00:09:43 The horse cast.
00:09:45 Where's my Blu-ray copy?
00:09:46 Oh, for a second, I thought you meant the pony cast.
00:09:49 No.
00:09:50 Whoa.
00:09:51 Whoa.
00:09:52 That takes me back.
00:09:53 You know, Ben knows this and Gib knows this, but Tom, you don't know this.
00:09:59 That means.
00:10:01 Sounds like most things.
00:10:03 Me and Munchy and Ethan and Steve and Acro.
00:10:08 Like three years ago, we recorded one episode of a podcast where we reviewed the horse
00:10:15 cast, like we recapped the horse cast and like I found that podcast recently because
00:10:22 it was up on YouTube.
00:10:23 I think it's set to private now.
00:10:24 It has like fucking 200 views on it and I realized that like I was listening to the
00:10:30 horse cast when I was like a 15 year old kid.
00:10:35 So what you're saying is we should just release that podcast as this week's episode.
00:10:39 Yes.
00:10:40 Yeah.
00:10:42 I remember watching that and how people like everyone was like so kind of unsettled by
00:10:55 how weird, yeah, cringe and like knew the relationship was between all of us in the
00:11:01 horse cast early days.
00:11:03 Yeah, especially me.
00:11:05 I paid attention to what they thought of what I was doing because I always hated that.
00:11:09 I was like, Oh God.
00:11:10 It's the most embarrassing thing ever.
00:11:12 I don't know how to speak to anybody.
00:11:13 Oh really?
00:11:14 Are you embarrassed by the horse cast?
00:11:15 Well, in like a general like I was like really shy and obviously like bad at speaking to
00:11:23 people.
00:11:24 I still am, but like less so, but like I don't like want to hide it.
00:11:30 It's just funny.
00:11:31 It's just funny how bad I was like doing all of that stuff.
00:11:35 And yet I was on a podcast for like five years.
00:11:37 I mean, like that podcast, like the first one was like your first time like talking
00:11:42 to Jesse.
00:11:43 Yeah.
00:11:44 Period.
00:11:45 Was it not?
00:11:46 Yeah.
00:11:47 And in voice call, I think it was, we were going to do the horse cast, but Digi or Trixie
00:11:53 was a was not able to be there.
00:11:55 So we were in a Skype group.
00:11:58 We just did it.
00:11:59 I had never talked to him before.
00:12:02 I talked to him in text, but yeah, it's so weird because it was extremely awkward.
00:12:07 That stupid little, like I back in the day when I was a fucking child, I like re listened
00:12:14 to the horse casts and like there's imagine doing some such a thing.
00:12:21 I think there was some joke like made in the horse cast.
00:12:24 I don't know who said it might have been Jesse where they were just like, oh, I love to go
00:12:27 re listened to the old horse cast.
00:12:30 And I was thinking like, yes, oh my God, I literally do.
00:12:35 Wonderful.
00:12:36 So funny.
00:12:37 That's terrible.
00:12:39 So there was a horse movie.
00:12:41 Yeah.
00:12:42 It just came out.
00:12:45 How'd you guys like the pony movie?
00:12:47 Five out of 10.
00:12:49 Really?
00:12:50 Let's move on.
00:12:51 Really?
00:12:52 Yeah.
00:12:53 Oh man.
00:12:54 No, I thought it was great.
00:12:56 I didn't get that.
00:12:57 I didn't get that much out of it.
00:12:58 I didn't think it was that great.
00:12:59 I didn't hear that much about it.
00:13:02 Yeah.
00:13:03 See, my thing, I really quite enjoyed it.
00:13:06 It was sort of comfort food, if you will.
00:13:10 I can tell it's not like the best thing ever, but it was the best pony movie I've ever
00:13:15 seen because the rest of them, they have they have they have a problem with like six protagonists
00:13:22 plus new movie specific characters and villains.
00:13:26 It's never enough time.
00:13:27 But like with this new thing, it was like, oh yeah.
00:13:31 It's a pony movie built from the ground up to be a movie.
00:13:34 It's got the three acts, it's got the hero's journey.
00:13:37 It's got cute moments.
00:13:38 It's got funny moments.
00:13:39 It's got great music.
00:13:40 I enjoyed myself thoroughly.
00:13:41 It was a very nice time.
00:13:43 I compared it favorably to the, you know, the two part, the premiere episode of Gen 4.
00:13:53 That one is like famously terrible.
00:13:56 It's not that bad.
00:13:58 The second one is really bad.
00:14:00 The second half where they go on the quest and what did I say last night?
00:14:03 I said, I honestly swear that you won't die if you let go.
00:14:09 So dumb.
00:14:10 So it's better than that, which is not a high bar, but it's something.
00:14:15 So I mean, it wasn't a nightmare.
00:14:17 It wasn't a complete disaster, but I'm, you know, we were watching it, Kazi, and we're
00:14:22 just like, oh, they're in like a spooky valley.
00:14:24 Do you think they're going to meet their next friend now?
00:14:27 And then she did.
00:14:28 And we were like, well, okay.
00:14:30 I mean, what's so weird about that?
00:14:32 Like the story is progressing.
00:14:34 I called.
00:14:35 Things happen.
00:14:36 It's like, wow.
00:14:37 Things happen in a fucking movie.
00:14:40 It just wasn't, it just wasn't, I know, but it just wasn't very engaging.
00:14:43 I, by the way, I called, I called the, I didn't know what the plot was, but I called it like,
00:14:48 oh, the unicorns don't have magic.
00:14:50 I bet the Pegas I can't fly either.
00:14:52 I was like, yeah, they can't fly.
00:14:53 I was like, wow, they have wings, but they can't fly because it doesn't make any sense.
00:14:56 It doesn't make any sense.
00:14:57 It doesn't make any sense.
00:15:00 I'm a genius.
00:15:01 I don't remember what the Pegasus name is that they end up, the two Pegasus.
00:15:05 Zip and zip.
00:15:06 Zip and pip.
00:15:07 Zip and pip.
00:15:08 Zip, I guess she was just falling with style in that scene.
00:15:12 She's just doing flips.
00:15:14 She's just doing flips.
00:15:15 Believe it or not, I watched the movie twice and I was paying attention to that the second
00:15:20 time.
00:15:21 And yeah, she's kind of just like jumping on rocks.
00:15:24 Okay.
00:15:25 But then she like comes up from the side of the cliff and it's like in a way that you
00:15:29 couldn't do unless you had some momentum to fly.
00:15:32 No, it's fine.
00:15:33 It was a big jump.
00:15:34 But also it's a child's film.
00:15:35 That's just some classic misdirection.
00:15:37 That's a Tony Hawk maneuver.
00:15:39 Okay.
00:15:40 Here's one thing that I don't understand.
00:15:43 When they leave Pegasus Kingdom and zip and pip both come along and I'm like, I thought
00:15:49 we're supposed to hate pip.
00:15:50 Pip is like obnoxious.
00:15:51 Pip is like an annoying Instagram influencer.
00:15:54 I kind of thought she was set up to be someone we don't like.
00:15:57 But then she comes along and it's like, well, she's just here now.
00:16:00 She's just one of our friends.
00:16:01 Friendship is magic, family.
00:16:02 We have to be friends.
00:16:03 Well, I'm like, oh, really?
00:16:04 What do you mean?
00:16:05 They're bringing her?
00:16:06 It's a, it's, it's, it's zip sister.
00:16:09 You know, you can't just, you can't just throw out your family.
00:16:11 She had a moment where she was like, I can't believe you ruined everything.
00:16:13 She could just stay at home.
00:16:15 She can't.
00:16:16 What do you mean?
00:16:17 She was on the run.
00:16:18 The royals are on the run.
00:16:19 Yeah.
00:16:20 Did you watch this film?
00:16:21 It was out of necessity at first.
00:16:23 And then it was like, and she was like grumbling and with what's his face.
00:16:27 It's like, I can't believe they fucked my life up.
00:16:29 And he's like, yeah, it sucks, doesn't it?
00:16:31 The cop, the cop.
00:16:32 Wait, did I just agree with the characters?
00:16:33 The cop pony.
00:16:34 And then it was like, oh, then they just sort of hung out and realized it was fine.
00:16:38 It's cute.
00:16:39 It's a really cute movie.
00:16:40 I like it.
00:16:41 I just, I don't know.
00:16:42 It's like, why is this person that I don't like along for the ride?
00:16:45 The same, I felt the same about the cop.
00:16:47 The Instagram lady and the cop are both, they both shit.
00:16:50 I hate them.
00:16:51 Bruins it.
00:16:52 The main character is a nice story.
00:16:53 The cop is great.
00:16:54 I'm like, really?
00:16:55 These guys, these guys are going to be in the show that you expect me to watch?
00:16:58 No, no, no.
00:16:59 The cop is great because for not even one moment, is the cop ever like a good guy?
00:17:04 No.
00:17:05 He's always petty.
00:17:06 He's never right.
00:17:07 Why is he here?
00:17:08 Go away.
00:17:09 It's great.
00:17:10 You know, we're teaching the kids.
00:17:11 Yeah.
00:17:12 Don't trust the cops.
00:17:13 My little pony, you know, they implicitly said ACAB.
00:17:16 Why did they play?
00:17:17 I think you are supposed to like him by the end.
00:17:19 He's one of the main characters, a cop and a man, by the way.
00:17:22 Why is this guy in our movie?
00:17:24 Get him out of here.
00:17:26 It was really funny.
00:17:27 The beginning of the movie was hilarious to me because we meet the dad, right?
00:17:33 And he seems like a competent, good head on his shoulder.
00:17:37 Nice guy.
00:17:38 Good father.
00:17:39 I'm like, oh my God.
00:17:40 That's shitty facial hair though.
00:17:41 Shitty facial hair.
00:17:42 Well, everybody has their flaws.
00:17:44 I'm like, is this like a respectable male character in My Little Pony?
00:17:49 This really is a new generation.
00:17:51 Dies between cops.
00:17:52 We're back to where we should be.
00:17:55 Oh no.
00:17:56 Okay, I was so sure that he was not actually dead that it was going to be revealed that
00:18:01 he was actually on a long trip like Arnold's parents to the jungle or something.
00:18:07 You just went to a farm.
00:18:08 You know, they never once mentioned that he was dead.
00:18:12 So he could appear in the show.
00:18:14 I just stepped out to get milk for 10 years.
00:18:17 No, no.
00:18:18 See, I think that was genius.
00:18:19 It was genius not because they'll bring him back, but because they're showing that Sunny
00:18:24 has grown up.
00:18:25 She's aged.
00:18:26 She's gotten over it.
00:18:27 She's learned to accept that her father is gone.
00:18:29 You know, you easily make her whole character.
00:18:31 Whatever it was.
00:18:32 Oh, my dad died.
00:18:33 They didn't do that.
00:18:34 She's over it.
00:18:35 No, but that's quite good.
00:18:37 She doesn't cry about it.
00:18:38 It's not a big deal.
00:18:39 It's like, oh yeah.
00:18:40 Sometimes your parents are gone.
00:18:41 You've got to work on things yourself.
00:18:43 Yeah.
00:18:44 No, that's great.
00:18:45 Here's the thing.
00:18:46 And here's the thing.
00:18:47 When I die, I hope that none of you ever get over it.
00:18:49 I hope that you do spend the rest of your life moaning about, like, I miss Ben so much.
00:18:54 Ben, I'll get over it so fast it'll make your head.
00:18:57 Otherwise I'd be really offended from beyond the grave.
00:19:00 It'll make you spin in your grave so fast that you'll dig a fucking tunnel to hell.
00:19:06 That's how you got to do it.
00:19:09 So I just thought that was pretty disrespectful of her to not spend the whole movie being
00:19:13 like, my dad's gone.
00:19:15 He was such a cool guy.
00:19:17 I mean, whatever.
00:19:18 I never assumed that he was like a rare poochie.
00:19:22 If you just don't love your dad that much, you know, it's fine.
00:19:25 It is what it is.
00:19:26 I never assumed he was going to come back because she says, she kind of talks to the
00:19:29 picture frame and that's like a thing you do if they're dead, right?
00:19:32 That's not a thing you do if they're, like, away.
00:19:35 That's what I was thinking.
00:19:37 He's right in the painting.
00:19:39 No, I think if he had just been away for, like, years, it would be you could also just
00:19:42 be like, talk to the painting.
00:19:44 I mean, you know, either way, he's gone, right?
00:19:46 And you're like, I wish you were here today.
00:19:48 Maybe.
00:19:49 They have wiggle room that if they wanted to bring him back, they could.
00:19:51 I definitely think they, I really thought they were going to.
00:19:54 He was going to show up, like, in the final act and be like, oh, hey, that's all the conflict.
00:19:59 You did it.
00:20:00 You did it.
00:20:01 I said all the clues and then you did it.
00:20:03 You're like a real daughter.
00:20:05 You followed the breadcrumb trail that I left for you.
00:20:09 Oh, it turns out he had entrapped himself in the gems.
00:20:13 It's just like sore.
00:20:14 Why not?
00:20:15 It's just like sore.
00:20:16 He's just like sore.
00:20:17 Oh, the gem.
00:20:20 Should we talk about the gems?
00:20:21 Should we talk about the actual plot of the movie?
00:20:24 Well, OK.
00:20:25 Spoilers.
00:20:26 I mean, obviously spoilers for the whole fucking movie because why would you.
00:20:31 There is not a single person in our audience that either A hasn't already seen this movie
00:20:36 or B doesn't give a single song.
00:20:38 Why did you watch a podcast about a movie you haven't seen?
00:20:41 Absolutely.
00:20:42 You can't make hours of content about a movie without spoiling it.
00:20:45 You just can't.
00:20:46 Ben, do you remember?
00:20:48 Me and Ben watched this movie together.
00:20:50 I was a little bit tipsy watching the movie.
00:20:53 I just want to be clear.
00:20:54 If I don't remember some things, it's because I was like five or six trulys deep.
00:20:59 You drank an entire pack of trulys.
00:21:01 Almost.
00:21:02 You drank like nine or ten.
00:21:04 Almost.
00:21:05 But we watched the movie.
00:21:06 The only way you could get through this.
00:21:07 We watched the movie just you and me because I had Netflix and you were at my house.
00:21:12 And we did that.
00:21:13 And then Munchie was like, I also want to watch it and make a party out of it.
00:21:17 And so, you know, we sat down in the living room.
00:21:22 No, no, no.
00:21:23 Wait.
00:21:24 Funny story.
00:21:25 You were like, I have Netflix.
00:21:26 I was like, oh, well, can I watch the pony movie here?
00:21:29 And you were like, yeah, I can watch.
00:21:30 And you were like, let me ask Munchie if he wants to watch with us.
00:21:33 And you asked him and he was like, no, I don't want to watch that movie.
00:21:36 And then you were like, well, I think me and Ben are going to watch it.
00:21:38 And he was like, oh, shit.
00:21:39 Well, in that case, don't watch.
00:21:41 No, I do want to watch it actually.
00:21:42 But we watched it anyway.
00:21:43 I changed my mind.
00:21:44 We watched it anyway.
00:21:46 Well, you watched it twice.
00:21:48 Yeah.
00:21:49 No, well, it was because you were talking about the gems.
00:21:52 Because we all were watching it again in the living room.
00:21:57 And then you showed up towards the end of the movie and I sort of got up and hung out
00:22:01 with you in the kitchen.
00:22:02 And then we heard people shouting from the living room.
00:22:06 And Ben was like, I know exactly what's going on.
00:22:09 They see the third gem in the background.
00:22:11 They all just noticed the third gem.
00:22:13 Because when we were watching it and we both were like, oh my god, there's the freaky looking
00:22:18 lantern with the most sparkly jewel in the entire universe.
00:22:21 Well, there it is.
00:22:22 There's the McGuffin.
00:22:23 And it's frustrating that it's on screen.
00:22:26 And I can tell, OK, there it is.
00:22:29 You're supposed to do that.
00:22:30 You're supposed to screen.
00:22:31 Why is it there?
00:22:32 At what point?
00:22:33 Do you mean right at the beginning?
00:22:34 At the end.
00:22:35 No, no, no.
00:22:36 At the spoilers.
00:22:37 What she's looking at.
00:22:38 What you said.
00:22:39 After she comes back from the quest and the quest has failed.
00:22:42 I mean, she finds it right after that, though, doesn't she?
00:22:45 Yeah, but there's a minute.
00:22:46 In a moment.
00:22:47 Yeah.
00:22:48 OK.
00:22:49 Yeah.
00:22:50 She she goes home and she's just like fucking around with her stuff.
00:22:54 And it just like is there in the like lamp.
00:22:57 That's for some reason.
00:22:59 The jewel is fine.
00:23:00 I'm not saying it's a problem with the movie.
00:23:02 I'm not cinemas in stinging it or anything.
00:23:05 It sounds like you are, though.
00:23:07 No, I mean, what's the complaint like?
00:23:10 Yeah.
00:23:11 Of course.
00:23:12 They want you to see it at that moment.
00:23:14 You're supposed to realize.
00:23:16 Not only does it make sense compositionally in a metatextual sense.
00:23:21 It makes sense that Sunny having this object since her childhood is like not looking at
00:23:26 it as a MacGuffin.
00:23:27 OK.
00:23:28 Just as like an object that's been part of her life.
00:23:30 You're not going to like make that connection, especially since up to that point, there
00:23:33 wasn't even an implication that there was a third gem.
00:23:36 That was like the revelation of that scene.
00:23:38 OK.
00:23:39 But obviously there was going to be a third gem.
00:23:40 OK.
00:23:41 Yes.
00:23:42 Of course, obviously, like from our perspective.
00:23:44 Yes.
00:23:45 And that's why they show it, so you can bring that home.
00:23:48 But you didn't see, do you see the gem earlier, like in the beginning of the movie?
00:23:51 Yes.
00:23:52 Do you kind of see it?
00:23:53 Yeah, he's building that little thing.
00:23:54 I don't know if I see the gem, and I can't remember.
00:23:56 David, explain where he got it.
00:23:58 I don't think so.
00:24:00 Well, he's an explorer, architect, archeologist.
00:24:03 I want to find out why nobody likes each other.
00:24:05 He's an earth pony.
00:24:06 And they're in their earth pony town, just like the other places just had the gems because
00:24:10 they're birth writers.
00:24:11 Because they have them.
00:24:13 Yeah.
00:24:14 I mean, I was looking for an explanation on the second watch.
00:24:17 I didn't get one.
00:24:18 A distant descendant of Star Swirl of Beard.
00:24:21 That's why his beard was so shitty.
00:24:24 It's just so many generations removed.
00:24:26 It's just the magic was gone.
00:24:27 His horn nearly gone.
00:24:29 His beard terrible.
00:24:32 What I'm saying is not even a complaint.
00:24:35 I'm honestly complaining about like, oh shit, the movie got one over on me.
00:24:39 The movie got me to understand the stakes, and then it showed me on the corner of the
00:24:43 screen, the object of the jeopardy.
00:24:45 And I'm sitting in the theater.
00:24:47 I'm pointing.
00:24:48 I go, oh my god, there.
00:24:49 There it is.
00:24:50 It's like Dora.
00:24:51 It's like watching Dora.
00:24:52 Yeah.
00:24:53 Yeah.
00:24:54 Ben's plan.
00:24:55 Ben's clues.
00:24:56 Yes.
00:24:57 Yeah.
00:24:58 Guys, I'm going to be real with you.
00:24:59 I've seen this movie twice, and I still don't know what the fuck happened.
00:25:03 What?
00:25:04 There's so much going on.
00:25:05 What do you mean?
00:25:06 You don't understand.
00:25:07 There's so much going on at any moment.
00:25:09 I'm too busy.
00:25:10 I'm too busy paying attention to the spike.
00:25:12 It's so dense.
00:25:13 Every shot has so many moving parts.
00:25:16 Well, there's a pony.
00:25:18 And she wants to be friends with people.
00:25:20 No, I'm joking.
00:25:21 I know.
00:25:22 She doesn't want to be friends with people.
00:25:24 Why do you even say that?
00:25:25 She wants to be friends with magical people.
00:25:27 I just, towards the end, you just kind of get like mind fucked.
00:25:31 And then like, the red cop.
00:25:35 Yes, this movie mind fucks you towards the end.
00:25:37 Like the red cop gets in his big fucking Avangelion.
00:25:41 And I'm just like, I don't know what the fuck's going on anymore.
00:25:44 Like, I no longer know what the plot of this movie is because he got in the big robot.
00:25:49 Everything about Sprout sucked.
00:25:51 I'm saying that.
00:25:52 No.
00:25:53 I'm proud of Sprout.
00:25:54 It's like the stupid, funny idiot.
00:25:56 Sprout's angry mob song is the highlight of the movie.
00:25:58 Oh, it's a bear.
00:25:59 Absolute bear.
00:26:00 No, I hate it.
00:26:01 I hate it.
00:26:02 It is.
00:26:03 I hate Sprout so much.
00:26:04 I agree.
00:26:05 Yes.
00:26:06 That was pretty genuine.
00:26:08 Angry, angry.
00:26:09 Genuinely, the funniest part of the whole movie, probably the best part is the part
00:26:13 because it's stupid on purpose.
00:26:15 And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you know what movie?
00:26:17 You are stupid.
00:26:18 I agree.
00:26:19 But you're doing it on purpose now.
00:26:21 I'm with it.
00:26:22 He did the White Stripes Seven Nation Army music.
00:26:24 Yeah.
00:26:25 Oh man, that was so cool.
00:26:27 When, yeah, when that song came on and it's sort of like a rock medley, I was like, are
00:26:32 all the songs like, like references to other pop, because the Netflix description of the
00:26:38 movie is like ponies go on an adventure set to like a, like a pop soundtrack.
00:26:43 And I'm like, are they, are all the songs like, like adaptations of pop?
00:26:47 Oh.
00:26:48 Yeah.
00:26:49 Everything's like a, like a loose ripoff.
00:26:50 Are they really?
00:26:51 That's really tough to know these things.
00:26:53 And that song I could tell that it was like a medley.
00:26:56 I don't mind.
00:26:57 I don't mind.
00:26:58 I'm just wondering, because if, if all the other songs were derived from pop hits, like,
00:27:03 I do think there was originally going to be like, just like licensed music and Hasbro
00:27:07 is like, we're not paying for that shit.
00:27:09 No, I don't, I don't think so.
00:27:10 I'm sure this was always the plan.
00:27:12 Probably.
00:27:13 I think I have an essence.
00:27:15 I just remember the Lady Gaga side of it.
00:27:19 10 out of 10.
00:27:20 I was surprised just because, just because, you know, the old show was, you know, it had
00:27:24 its, its original like, like songs.
00:27:27 And then, you know, to hear these like, I don't, I don't, I think I don't like it that
00:27:32 it's like real world pop songs are what we set the movie to.
00:27:36 It's like, oh, okay.
00:27:37 No, I think it's good because they're sort of doing this in the style of a musical, right?
00:27:42 Like every time they do a song, it's, it's non-diagetic.
00:27:45 A musical review.
00:27:47 Yeah.
00:27:48 And the ponies are always doing like the, the musical actor face where they're smiling,
00:27:53 they're extremely big during the song.
00:27:55 It's, it's very much like seeing a musical on a stage.
00:27:59 And in that kind of setting, this is the kind of music they would have, which would be like
00:28:03 sort of a, a pop amalgamation.
00:28:06 True, I suppose.
00:28:07 I liked it a lot because, I mean, it sounds better than just a generic, any given pop
00:28:13 song because of the, the lyrics were like, true.
00:28:20 I don't usually pay attention to lyrics and songs, but I really liked, I don't know,
00:28:29 something about the, the arrangement of the words in the music was good.
00:28:35 And I liked that.
00:28:36 I don't know how to describe it, but I don't know.
00:28:41 How do you just, how do you say lyrics good in a specific way like that?
00:28:45 You just say lyrics good.
00:28:47 I appreciated the, the syllables, the syllables were replaced excellently.
00:28:52 The phonetics had a flow to them.
00:28:55 Masterful lyricism, poetry, it was poetry in motion.
00:28:58 It was poetry in audio.
00:29:00 Yeah, like when they said, here's a corn, it's on the cob.
00:29:03 Here's a bag.
00:29:05 Like that kind of, like when they said that.
00:29:08 I felt like the rub bit was, was lame, but the corn on the cob was perfect.
00:29:13 I don't remember.
00:29:14 There were some parts in like the Izzy song where they're trying to like learn to be
00:29:17 unicorns where there was like some awkward rhymes.
00:29:19 But like, yeah.
00:29:20 No, no, the rap is good.
00:29:22 It was actually good rap.
00:29:24 This, this movie actually gets some points for not making a cringe rap section.
00:29:28 Like it actually worked.
00:29:30 I kind of like it a little bit.
00:29:31 It was like only, it was only like 50% cringe instead of 110% cringe.
00:29:35 Like, oh, I was moving.
00:29:36 No, no, you're right, Tom.
00:29:37 It was bang.
00:29:38 The last movie I watched was Space Jam, a new legacy.
00:29:41 And they had like a rap in that that was actually like physically destructive.
00:29:45 Like I'm pretty sure I aged 10 years watching.
00:29:48 You took psychic damage.
00:29:50 Yeah.
00:29:51 Am I, am I crazy?
00:29:52 Has LeBron like ever rapped?
00:29:55 Does he, does he do any, any music?
00:29:57 He didn't rap in it.
00:29:58 It was like Elmer Fudd who rapped it.
00:30:00 I don't mean in the movie.
00:30:01 I mean, in general, has he ever done like, like, like a, like a rap album or something
00:30:04 like Pull Day?
00:30:05 Yeah.
00:30:06 He's been trying to get into it for a few years.
00:30:08 I thought so.
00:30:09 So I like, like, it wouldn't surprise me too much if there was some of that in the
00:30:13 movie, but if it's bad, it's like, well, that's not good.
00:30:17 It was probably the most painful movie going experience I've ever had in my life was that
00:30:22 three minutes.
00:30:23 I don't remember what song it was.
00:30:26 I don't even remember what is happening, but there's one song that has like a little,
00:30:30 there's a little aside where just there, they're singing about the adventure that they're
00:30:34 on and the cop pony just like, there's like, if we fail, we'll go to jail.
00:30:38 And I'm like, prison.
00:30:39 They'll go to prison.
00:30:40 He doesn't even rhyme it.
00:30:41 He says if we fail, we're going to prison.
00:30:44 Ben laughed so hard with that part.
00:30:46 Because it's just like, you're going to, you're the one who's going to put us there.
00:30:50 He loves fucking jail.
00:30:51 The cop.
00:30:52 What are you talking about?
00:30:53 So damn much.
00:30:54 This entire movie.
00:30:55 He's so fucking into it.
00:30:56 No, it's good.
00:30:57 No, it's good.
00:30:58 It's good because otherwise we don't want the kids to forget for a moment that this guy
00:31:01 is terrible.
00:31:02 He's a cop.
00:31:03 He loves, he loves jail.
00:31:04 No.
00:31:05 That's not even true.
00:31:06 Why is he in on my show?
00:31:09 Get out.
00:31:10 I didn't get the sense that he was like authoritarian with his police chief stuff.
00:31:17 That's the whole movie.
00:31:18 He's just supposed to be mildly annoying.
00:31:20 But like, he's really a good guy.
00:31:22 He's supposed to be like, oh, I'm your friend.
00:31:24 But like, I can't.
00:31:25 That's his whole shtick.
00:31:26 And like, the whole, like the whole rub in the beginning is that, is like, hey, Sonny,
00:31:30 look, I'm your friend, but like, please stop doing illegal things.
00:31:33 It puts me in an awkward position, but he's not like fucking immediately thrown the book
00:31:37 at her.
00:31:38 Yeah, that's the other guy.
00:31:39 Okay, but the whole reason he's out on the adventure is because like, well, I got to
00:31:45 go and put her in jail because she consorted with some foreigners and that's not cool.
00:31:51 Well, it ends with the kids.
00:31:52 Yeah, because there's like hundreds of years of indoctrination in the culture.
00:31:55 This is annoying to me.
00:31:57 Like, his whole thing is like, I got to go find, I got to go arrest her.
00:32:01 I guess she might also be in danger, so I guess I'm going to save her from danger.
00:32:04 But like, the point of what I'm doing is I got to go find her and burn her to jail.
00:32:08 Until they get to the campfire and then he turns around.
00:32:10 Yes, but then they, well, but then they, is that, I don't remember a moment where he's
00:32:14 like, you know what?
00:32:15 I changed my mind.
00:32:16 Actually, there was a big moment where he literally, is he brings out the letter that
00:32:21 that Sonny and her dad made in the beginning of the movie.
00:32:23 And she's like, this is why I came in the first place.
00:32:25 Cause I was told I had friends here.
00:32:27 And like in that moment, he's like, oh, you know what?
00:32:29 I want to do my part.
00:32:30 I'm going to help.
00:32:31 This is something, this is actually something that could bring us together and is a good
00:32:34 thing.
00:32:35 And that was a good moment.
00:32:36 Oh, yeah.
00:32:37 Okay.
00:32:38 His police thing was only at the Pegasus area.
00:32:40 You know what?
00:32:41 Cause they were all in the other room.
00:32:43 Getting another truly at that moment.
00:32:45 He missed that.
00:32:46 Yeah, genuinely.
00:32:47 You know why I don't remember that moment?
00:32:48 The emotional crux of the film.
00:32:50 He just was powerful.
00:32:51 Okay.
00:32:52 Okay.
00:32:53 I do remember that moment, but what I remember is that I foolishly forgot about the letter.
00:32:57 I like, it seems obvious.
00:32:58 Oh, that was obvious.
00:32:59 Oh my God, dude.
00:33:00 Come on.
00:33:01 Yeah, but I forgot about the letter.
00:33:02 So when she pulled out the letter, I'm like, oh, I remember that.
00:33:05 I remember they set that up in the movie.
00:33:07 Oh my God.
00:33:08 The movie got me is like, I forgot about that too.
00:33:11 And it's so obvious.
00:33:12 Cause I was like, why is he even here in the first place?
00:33:14 And then like, it's so, it's like so blatantly obvious.
00:33:17 I'm like, oh God, I'm an idiot.
00:33:19 Oh, no.
00:33:20 He did set it up.
00:33:21 It does make sense.
00:33:22 The kids movie bamboozled me.
00:33:23 Okay.
00:33:24 Yeah.
00:33:25 I was sitting there waiting for her to pull the letter out.
00:33:27 And then she did.
00:33:28 And Ben was like, oh my God.
00:33:29 And I was like, man, are you kidding me?
00:33:31 Like this movie, this is a masterpiece.
00:33:34 This is an absolute masterpiece.
00:33:37 The Citizen Kane.
00:33:38 Did Orson Welles write this movie?
00:33:41 Did Alfred Hitchcock set up the Jeopardy?
00:33:45 I'm on the edge of my seat.
00:33:48 Right, but the cop is bad.
00:33:52 Yeah, no, like towards the end, I was like, well, you know, he turns around and I'm like,
00:33:56 I'm supposed to enjoy this character, but he's not going to stop being a cop.
00:34:00 I know that's not going to happen.
00:34:02 So I can't enjoy him.
00:34:04 The movie, I think I did enjoy the movie more as it went on.
00:34:08 Izzy was cute.
00:34:10 I like Izzy, frankly.
00:34:11 I think she's pretty adorable.
00:34:13 Izzy's great.
00:34:14 Sure.
00:34:15 Yeah.
00:34:16 Izzy gang.
00:34:17 Izzy gang is great.
00:34:18 Izzy's good.
00:34:19 Sonny's good.
00:34:20 I like Sonny too.
00:34:21 Sonny had the best like fuck your shit face throughout the entire movie.
00:34:25 Like every time something blatantly stupid happens, she's just like Jesus fucking Christ.
00:34:29 I'm sad with these fucking smooth brains.
00:34:31 What am I going to do?
00:34:33 Sonny's my favorite for sure.
00:34:35 Sonny is just right 100% of the time, just like me.
00:34:38 And just trying to win everybody over, wake them up.
00:34:41 It's great.
00:34:42 It's wonderful.
00:34:43 Wow.
00:34:44 What an interesting character.
00:34:45 Just being right the whole time.
00:34:47 I'm trying to like visualize the characters, but I can't help but envision the Gary's Mod
00:34:52 pony models as the characters.
00:34:55 I can't think of what they actually look like.
00:34:58 I'm seeing Gary's Mod right now.
00:35:00 Oh no.
00:35:01 Oh, it's terrifying.
00:35:03 The designs are pretty good.
00:35:06 Yeah.
00:35:07 Okay.
00:35:08 I don't like.
00:35:09 At the end of the day.
00:35:10 At the end of the day.
00:35:11 Hair cut.
00:35:12 I don't really like.
00:35:13 The zip hair cut is.
00:35:14 The zip hair cut is.
00:35:15 The zip hair cut.
00:35:16 The eyebrows.
00:35:17 The eyebrows are not great.
00:35:19 Everything else is probably as good as they could have done.
00:35:21 In 3D.
00:35:22 I don't know.
00:35:23 I like the eyebrows.
00:35:24 What's wrong with them?
00:35:25 You don't like them because.
00:35:26 It's not that any of the.
00:35:27 Toneys look.
00:35:28 I don't like candy sometimes.
00:35:29 Particularly bad.
00:35:30 I just, I still don't like the 3D.
00:35:32 It just looks like any other like Dreamworks.
00:35:35 It is much more generic.
00:35:36 Production.
00:35:37 It just has that generic 3D look.
00:35:39 And like it.
00:35:40 Yeah.
00:35:41 I guess they did it well.
00:35:42 It looks good, but like I don't like it.
00:35:44 I don't know.
00:35:45 I don't think that's a nuanced opinion.
00:35:47 I think you just haven't seen a lot of 3D.
00:35:51 The, it's.
00:35:52 As someone who has seen a lot of 3D.
00:35:54 It's pretty true.
00:35:55 It just looks like a lot.
00:35:56 They have the same eyes.
00:35:57 They have the big.
00:35:58 Well.
00:35:59 The same Disney eyes.
00:36:00 There's.
00:36:01 I wouldn't go that far.
00:36:02 There is some subtle differentiation in the stylization of this movie.
00:36:05 It just doesn't go nearly as far as like the material that came before it.
00:36:09 You know?
00:36:10 Because even Sunny's action figures of the main six look much more visually distinct.
00:36:15 Well.
00:36:16 Than the characters themselves.
00:36:17 I liked how those looked.
00:36:18 I liked that they were clearly like carved wooden figures.
00:36:21 Yeah.
00:36:22 Who looked like.
00:36:23 I mean.
00:36:24 I like that Twilight's dead in this movie.
00:36:27 Every time.
00:36:28 Okay.
00:36:29 I was wondering are like those are.
00:36:30 Those are like real like historical figure.
00:36:32 Correct.
00:36:33 It's very.
00:36:34 The main thing.
00:36:35 The main thing that did in fact live.
00:36:36 I don't know that they are historical figures.
00:36:38 I think it's unclear.
00:36:39 Yeah.
00:36:40 Yeah.
00:36:41 They're in the canon of like her dad's storytelling.
00:36:42 Yeah.
00:36:43 Or are they fictional characters?
00:36:44 No.
00:36:45 No.
00:36:46 And in the ruins of the Pegasus city, they have like Twilight's symbol.
00:36:50 I guess.
00:36:51 But like I feel like you.
00:36:52 Okay.
00:36:53 That still doesn't necessarily confirm.
00:36:54 Yeah.
00:36:55 That could go.
00:36:56 I guess it could.
00:36:57 But I felt like the implication was very much that this all happened.
00:37:01 I thought so too.
00:37:02 I guess the whole story is that like, oh, we all used to live together because of this
00:37:07 story of Twilight and everybody.
00:37:08 Yeah.
00:37:09 No.
00:37:10 It's very funny.
00:37:11 My understanding was back in the day.
00:37:12 I agree.
00:37:13 I think the implication.
00:37:14 I think the implication is that like the, that is, it's just canon that like all the
00:37:18 events of Gen 4 happened at some point in the past.
00:37:22 But like 10,000 years ago, it's like Dark Souls 2 is like there's a whole kingdom built
00:37:28 on top of the old kingdom and all the names are different.
00:37:31 And as everyone's died, you know, a hundred times over, it's been so long, completely
00:37:35 legendary.
00:37:36 Yeah.
00:37:37 But you see, you see, yeah, there's a bunch of things that have Twilight's cutie mark
00:37:43 on it.
00:37:44 It has like a necklace with it on it.
00:37:46 You see it in the stained glass window.
00:37:47 You also see Rarity's cutie mark, like Rarity's jewel, cutie mark shows up in the, in the
00:37:52 same window.
00:37:53 Okay.
00:37:54 But let's think about this.
00:37:56 Why would Rarity's cutie mark be in the window?
00:37:59 Is it more likely that?
00:38:00 Because she's one of the, because she's like a fucking, a mortal from like a brief moment
00:38:06 in time versus someone like Twilight who would have lived a long time.
00:38:12 And we know the window's not that old, right?
00:38:15 Because this is in a station where they used to all meet up, used to all come up and shit,
00:38:19 but like it's, you know, it's fairly recent.
00:38:21 It's not ancient.
00:38:22 Yeah.
00:38:23 Yeah.
00:38:24 When they talk about it, it sounds like, it sounds like, oh yeah, the pony races used
00:38:27 to get along like, like 20 years ago.
00:38:30 Yeah.
00:38:31 It's like within, within a hundred or 200 years, it's not thousands of years.
00:38:34 It's supposed to be a couple hundred years ago, right?
00:38:36 That's how long it's been.
00:38:37 I don't remember.
00:38:38 I don't think that.
00:38:40 They don't say in the movie, but I thought like bleeding up trillion years ago, it was
00:38:44 supposed to be only a couple hundred years ago, which really begs the question to me,
00:38:48 why even bother tying these two together in the first place?
00:38:51 It seems like it would have been much easier if this was just a hard break and a new canon.
00:38:54 Well, that's what I'm saying.
00:38:55 I don't think they're really that tied together.
00:38:57 It's more like these are the figures that her dad carved.
00:39:01 He pulls in the symbology, you know, from, from the real world, but that doesn't mean
00:39:06 that those characters were real.
00:39:08 I don't know, Tom.
00:39:09 I really like, I like the idea that, you know, Twilight brought friendship to the land and
00:39:14 then somewhere along the line, she fucked up and it all got ruined and she fucking died.
00:39:18 And that's kind of like clearly.
00:39:21 She would still be alive if she hadn't fucked up and ruined.
00:39:26 Yeah.
00:39:27 And that's why she's dead.
00:39:28 A minor, like a much less extreme version of like when people complained about like
00:39:33 Star Wars and stuff.
00:39:34 It's like, oh, well, by continuing it and showing how everything immediately went back
00:39:37 to shit, it kind of like rubs the previous series of like it's victory, I guess, you
00:39:43 know, and this kind of does the same thing, but to a much lesser degree and to a degree
00:39:47 that bothers me far less as well.
00:39:51 It doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't impune the old story too much to be like, well, yeah,
00:39:57 that was great.
00:39:58 You know, eventually, you know, hundreds of thousands of years later, eventually things
00:40:01 did go back to shit.
00:40:02 I don't think it was that long.
00:40:03 That was the whole thing.
00:40:05 I seem to call an artist on Twitter drawing something about this particular conundrum,
00:40:11 which was very effective.
00:40:14 I think his name is Ben St.
00:40:16 What are you talking about?
00:40:18 What did I do?
00:40:19 I don't even remember.
00:40:21 The tweet, the Trump tweet with Twilight, with Phantom Horn going to the Trump rally.
00:40:29 To the rally.
00:40:30 Yeah.
00:40:31 Well, that was in response to this whole thing.
00:40:33 Of how we were dunking on the fact that Twilight fucked up, which was hilarious.
00:40:36 And then a bunch of people took it literally.
00:40:38 How do you not remember this?
00:40:39 Are you that fucking on over right now?
00:40:40 I remember drawing that image, but I don't, I feel like you're interpreting like a weird
00:40:44 intent behind it.
00:40:45 That was literally the point.
00:40:47 We were having a discussion about it on Twitter when you drew it.
00:40:50 What?
00:40:51 Where?
00:40:52 How long ago was this?
00:40:53 This is like a year ago.
00:40:54 No, like a year ago.
00:40:55 Six months ago.
00:40:56 Six months ago.
00:40:57 Because this was, this was after the, the riot, the Capitol riot, and I was like, yeah, Phantom
00:41:01 would have been at that.
00:41:03 No, that is not what this was about at all.
00:41:04 This was about when we were talking about how in this, like we were talking about how
00:41:08 the, when the summary of the movie came out and it was like, oh, Twilight fucked up.
00:41:13 And you drew that fucking drawing because.
00:41:15 What, what drawing?
00:41:16 The drawing of Phantom Horn at the, at the, at the Twilight rally.
00:41:21 How do you not remember this?
00:41:22 Like you got dragged on Twitter for it later because like a bunch of people started dogpiling
00:41:26 before it.
00:41:27 It's not, it's not a, wait, it's not a Twilight route.
00:41:29 No, it is.
00:41:30 Yeah it is.
00:41:31 Okay.
00:41:32 I think you're reading it because I don't, it didn't have anything to do with the movie.
00:41:35 We had a discussion about it on Twitter.
00:41:36 It didn't have anything to do with the movie.
00:41:37 Oh my God.
00:41:38 Okay, you're wrong.
00:41:39 It was just a political thing happened and I was like, yeah, Phantom is, is kind of
00:41:42 like that or he was kind of like that.
00:41:43 I'm really wrong.
00:41:44 I'm totally wrong.
00:41:45 What do you mean, what do you mean, no?
00:41:46 I'm telling you what my ethoreal intent was.
00:41:48 Because you didn't even remember you drew it five minutes ago.
00:41:51 No, I don't think so.
00:41:53 No, I don't think that's what you meant.
00:41:54 Okay.
00:41:55 We had a discussion on Twitter about this, but okay, sure.
00:41:58 All right.
00:41:59 I don't, I never have a discussion on Twitter.
00:42:01 I know.
00:42:02 Oh my God.
00:42:03 I don't do that.
00:42:04 When I say discussion, I mean like two tweets back and forth because that's how long a discussion
00:42:07 on Twitter should last.
00:42:08 I like to think that Twilight was mid-flight and then she fucked something up and the power
00:42:14 of friendship was gone, so she lost her flight powers in the fall because she was mid-flight
00:42:19 and the fall was so deadly that it fucking broke her, her, her alicorn immortality and
00:42:24 she died anyway.
00:42:25 And that's why she's not here anymore.
00:42:28 Like her bones got, all her bones got broken and the magic was not enough.
00:42:32 Her immortality was not enough to save her.
00:42:34 Her bones are too fucking broken.
00:42:37 Damn.
00:42:38 Yeah.
00:42:39 The, the window, I thought for a second that the window showed Twilight, but no, I think
00:42:47 it's just a bunch of other purple, purple ponies, just like creating the crystals.
00:42:52 Yeah, I mean, I think they're keeping it vague because they probably don't even know what
00:42:54 they're going to do with it long-term anyways, if anything.
00:42:56 Why are, okay, question.
00:42:58 Why are there three crystals that, if taken apart from each other, make ponies not have
00:43:05 magic anymore?
00:43:06 Well, that's, I think.
00:43:07 Well, that's, I think.
00:43:08 Because this is a child's movie.
00:43:09 Okay.
00:43:10 Well, yeah.
00:43:11 That's literally it.
00:43:12 Our job is to go over all of the fine-tune comb.
00:43:14 Why did the ponies make these three things?
00:43:16 Why did the ponies make these three crystals that, if separated, would render them all
00:43:20 useless?
00:43:21 Because it's a child's movie, Ben.
00:43:22 Hmm.
00:43:23 That's not exactly.
00:43:24 Well, well, hold on.
00:43:25 So, bringing the crystals.
00:43:26 The crystals are always done.
00:43:27 Yeah.
00:43:28 The original show is just like, oh.
00:43:29 The elements of.
00:43:30 The elements of harmony give you superpowers if you have them.
00:43:35 Yeah.
00:43:36 These are like, these don't give you anything.
00:43:37 They just, if you separate them, your entire species loses their whole fucking thing and
00:43:42 you have become like a bunch of.
00:43:43 Well, by the end of the movie.
00:43:44 I don't know whether it means that.
00:43:45 I think what, I mean, they're obviously just MacGuffins, but the reason that you put them
00:43:49 together and nothing happens, but then when you show them that you're truly committed to
00:43:55 being friends with everyone, then they wake up and they do something.
00:43:58 I feel like friendship, like, is more important than the crystals.
00:44:03 I don't think, like, if you put the crystals, you just took them.
00:44:07 People wouldn't stop being friends suddenly.
00:44:10 I think the friendship eroded and that's why the crystals are separate, you know, lost
00:44:14 their magic.
00:44:15 Yeah.
00:44:16 They're vague enough with like the lore that they can flesh all that out later if they
00:44:22 want to.
00:44:23 They just don't think they need to even bother because, like, they've established their cast.
00:44:29 They can go off and have their little half hour adventures going forward.
00:44:32 That's always been the best part of the last show.
00:44:34 I'm sure it'll be the best part of this show is just the character interaction.
00:44:38 Speaking of having your little adventures going forward, what's the deal with Sonny?
00:44:43 What is Sonny now?
00:44:46 She's an alchor.
00:44:47 Oh, yeah.
00:44:48 Obviously.
00:44:49 Is she permanent?
00:44:50 Is she permanently magical?
00:44:51 They didn't even have the decency to wait three seasons.
00:44:54 Greedy bastards.
00:44:55 When that happens, does she permanently just have glowing wings and a horn now?
00:44:59 I would assume.
00:45:00 Yes.
00:45:01 That only happens when you have toys with it.
00:45:03 So like they have.
00:45:04 Okay.
00:45:05 That's what I was saying.
00:45:06 When that happened, I looked at her and I was like, I know exactly what the toys going
00:45:10 to look like and what plastic they're going to make the wings and horn out of like when
00:45:14 she appeared.
00:45:15 They're going to use that clear plastic with the sparkles in it.
00:45:19 That's what they're going to do.
00:45:20 Sure.
00:45:21 Toys.
00:45:22 Toys is toys.
00:45:23 But that's fine.
00:45:24 Toys is toys.
00:45:25 That's fine.
00:45:26 I'll give you a toy.
00:45:27 Give me a toy.
00:45:28 I feel like they made the design like that in the movie sort of look temporary.
00:45:35 Like it's glowing and it's magic and it's not really actually a physical thing.
00:45:38 It looks like it's going to fade away.
00:45:39 I was kind of hoping they would flick her back out and this would be like, oh, this is like
00:45:42 your fucking elements of harmony, MacGuffin mode.
00:45:44 Yeah.
00:45:45 Maybe they needed to do that to sell a toy or whatever they say.
00:45:49 Just don't show it disappearing.
00:45:52 You can't do that.
00:45:53 We need people to want that.
00:45:54 Yeah.
00:45:55 People need to want to buy that.
00:45:56 They need to have the super form of Sunny.
00:46:00 It seems like, yeah, this is like a thing that's like when there's a problem and you
00:46:04 harness the magic of friendship to defeat an enemy.
00:46:06 We got a call for friendship.
00:46:08 This is her super form that she gets to do the, it's like summoning the Megazord.
00:46:15 Sunny went super sane.
00:46:16 Yes.
00:46:18 When you get the crystals together and you go friendship-powered, you get the gun and
00:46:22 you can shoot people and kill them.
00:46:24 It's like, okay, unicorns get their magic back.
00:46:27 Pegasi can fly again.
00:46:29 Earth ponies, they're like, hey, I found a gun.
00:46:31 Blam, blam, blam.
00:46:32 And that's what you get.
00:46:33 I mean, they honestly seem to be like inventors, they can make machines.
00:46:39 I was hoping that one of the things they would do is like give earth ponies something to
00:46:42 fucking do.
00:46:44 They don't get anything.
00:46:45 They had this whole thing going throughout the entire movie of Hitch having some strange
00:46:50 connection to nature.
00:46:51 All the animals just loved him.
00:46:52 I also didn't notice this.
00:46:54 Are they trying to set up something with earth pony magic?
00:46:58 They also had little hints of unicorn magic coming back because Izzy kept being able to
00:47:05 see people's ores and shit.
00:47:08 I thought those were all just breadcrumbs leading up to all of them getting their own
00:47:12 kind of magic, but earth ponies just get nothing, as usually.
00:47:15 Well, we don't know that because the movie ends, but they do show a small thing where
00:47:21 a bunch of ponies are one of each fillies that are like, we're playing and we're running.
00:47:28 Don't use magic now, we're going to race.
00:47:30 And then the earth ponies' hoof prints leave behind some sort of weird magic something
00:47:34 or other that sort of makes the grass glow when I assume that's like, oh, growing power.
00:47:40 That looked like shit.
00:47:41 That effect looked so bad.
00:47:43 It's not the last thing that happens in the movie.
00:47:46 It is the last grass.
00:47:47 Yes.
00:47:48 Yeah, no, me and Ben sat there and we were like, why does it look like shit?
00:47:52 We were just both struck by how bad it looked visually.
00:47:57 Okay, Izzy, she keeps bringing up, she talks about people's sparkles.
00:48:02 She says, my sparkle is bright or something, and she says, oh, your sparkle is tur- that's
00:48:07 just a weird Izzy or a reader thing.
00:48:10 I thought that was leading to something, but I think it was leading to literally nothing.
00:48:15 No, I think it was just trying to intro that the unicorns are like kind of hippy, superstitious,
00:48:23 you know.
00:48:24 I guess.
00:48:25 It makes sense.
00:48:26 They lay it on pretty thick once they get there.
00:48:27 They didn't need any lead up to it.
00:48:29 And like, I guess my question, why is Izzy the only one who's not like emotionally destitute?
00:48:34 Like I get, like she's so far beyond broken that she's just, she's looped back around.
00:48:40 That's what she's doing.
00:48:42 I mean, she's like Pinkie Pie on the farm.
00:48:45 That's what it's like.
00:48:46 Yeah, yeah.
00:48:47 It's the same.
00:48:48 I guess.
00:48:49 And she is the Pinkie Pie clone.
00:48:50 But that never really made much sense to you there.
00:48:51 We have a clone for all the main six basically, except for Fluttershy, I think.
00:48:55 Good.
00:48:56 I mean.
00:48:57 Well, I guess here is Fluttershy.
00:48:58 There's like a parallel to each person, to each pony.
00:49:00 Yeah, it's not exactly the same, but I guess it's good.
00:49:03 The dynamics aren't identical, which I think is a very similar archetype.
00:49:07 Like Pip isn't really a rarity.
00:49:10 She is vain, but I guess it's sort of a little different.
00:49:13 She's modern vain instead of classically vain.
00:49:15 Yeah, she's on her phone.
00:49:17 An H phone.
00:49:18 She's a zoomer.
00:49:19 She's a zoomer.
00:49:20 She's got a P phone.
00:49:22 Do you remember when it like, like it cuts back to like Maritai Bay and then when we go
00:49:29 back to like the Pegasus City, it just like shows an ad for perfume on the billboard.
00:49:35 And then that's it.
00:49:36 And then it just goes to something completely unrelated.
00:49:38 And I'm like, what was, are they just, are they just going to actually sell that perfume
00:49:43 in real life?
00:49:44 Like they just show an ad.
00:49:47 That's just to be like, oh, this is a real, this character is a real advertising consumerist
00:49:53 icon.
00:49:54 And this is what Pegasus City is like.
00:49:56 I guess it was just framed here.
00:49:57 It's all about those billboards.
00:49:59 Pegasus City says a lot about our society because the Pegasus I live, they clear, they
00:50:03 clearly live under late capitalism and also like, and the magic is dead.
00:50:08 Magic is gone in this, in this consumer society that they're relatable.
00:50:12 And I just think that that is like me too, you know, me as well.
00:50:17 We've all been there.
00:50:18 I mean, yeah, no, the earth ponies are too.
00:50:21 They have their, they have their stupid like Silicon Valley tech demo.
00:50:25 They do.
00:50:26 Yeah.
00:50:27 They have Steve Jobs.
00:50:28 What's, yeah.
00:50:29 What's her name is like, she's like, she's like Steve Jobs, like Elon Musk or Earth Pony.
00:50:34 Yes.
00:50:35 There's, there's something, look at, I made a, I made a stupid, I made a stupid hyperloop
00:50:40 that will help you like run away from unicorns faster or something.
00:50:43 There's something kind of related to that, that I wanted to talk about.
00:50:49 And I want to know if any of you guys noticed this, which is that throughout this movie,
00:50:56 like if there's ever, there's a lot of like character talking to crowd scenes.
00:51:01 And whenever that happens, the, the opinion of the crowd will just immediately shift based
00:51:07 on who is talking as in like one character will make their point and the entire crowd
00:51:12 will be swayed.
00:51:13 And then another character will say a thing and once again, the entire crowd will like
00:51:16 change their mind immediately and then just go back and forth and it happens every time
00:51:21 reactions though, like in most, in most all ages media, the crowds are pretty easily swayed,
00:51:27 just like real life.
00:51:28 Correct.
00:51:29 I just thought that that was funny and interesting.
00:51:31 Yeah.
00:51:32 It's, it's, it's, I mean, it's really awkward, the, like the, the, the beginning when, uh,
00:51:39 when Sunny like, I guess she's doing like a protest thing at like the, the, the, the,
00:51:45 the tech demo demonstration.
00:51:47 And it's like, they, it's like.
00:51:51 It was very strange to say, hey, don't do it before I have this plan this time, dad,
00:51:58 I'm going to be a smart, uh, pony and then she's like, walks up on stage and just like,
00:52:04 hey, stop her to do it, hitch, like, no, she's going to do it.
00:52:08 And he's like, Hey, don't do that thing that you always do.
00:52:11 And she's like, I won't, but then she does it.
00:52:14 But, uh, I think she just walks on stage and every year because he's like, that was
00:52:20 what he said.
00:52:21 He was like, Hey, every year I stopped you from doing this.
00:52:23 So like, just don't even bother this time.
00:52:25 But this is not even that disruptive.
00:52:27 She's not even that disruptive.
00:52:28 Like the, the, the demonstration just goes ahead with her in, in the, the boots or whatever.
00:52:34 Yeah.
00:52:35 And it's like, it's so, it's so, it's so, I find it weird that those wings and boots
00:52:40 didn't come back in any way.
00:52:43 Well the, the, the balloon, the, the pony, uh, that like get blown away out the window
00:52:48 and balloons keep showing up.
00:52:49 Like, yeah, that's, that's, that's a running gag, gag thing.
00:52:52 But like, um, you know, they got the slime ball throwing things.
00:52:57 That's just, I mean, that does come, yeah, that comes back in, but the, the, the, the
00:53:01 like anti-pegasus grab me boots don't do anything.
00:53:05 And the like metal wings, which I'm not even sure what they're supposed to do.
00:53:09 Well, I mean, they can't even fly up until the end of the movie.
00:53:11 So they would have been ineffective anyway, as I suppose, I guess.
00:53:14 Yeah.
00:53:15 I just felt like, I mean, I felt like those wings were like an opportunity to
00:53:18 like get the fuck out of there.
00:53:19 Oh, we got to run away.
00:53:20 Yeah.
00:53:20 Yeah.
00:53:21 But I mean, although these fucking wings, it's supposed to be the future
00:53:25 technology coming out of care logic.
00:53:26 So that stuff is not like widely available yet.
00:53:29 Although the, the little anti-brain read hats apparently somehow got manufactured.
00:53:36 Well, it took over manufacturing.
00:53:40 Oh, I really liked, um, the fucking in that scene where they're like, Oh God,
00:53:44 we got to stop the computer presses the one button repeatedly.
00:53:47 Yes, I like that.
00:53:49 They had, um, they had a, it was just like in the old, in gen four, um, daring.
00:53:55 What's, what's the woman who writes the daring do novels?
00:53:58 A.K.
00:53:59 Yerling.
00:54:00 Oh boy.
00:54:01 Yes.
00:54:01 Wow.
00:54:02 A.K.
00:54:02 Yerling.
00:54:03 Yeah.
00:54:03 She, she has the, the keyboard, but her keyboard is just like two big buttons.
00:54:08 They have the, they have the same, like just two big buttons as their keyboard.
00:54:11 I mean, what else are they going to do?
00:54:13 You have to click it like 14 times for K.
00:54:16 They do it in Morse code.
00:54:17 It's Morse code, basically.
00:54:18 It's like dashes and dots.
00:54:19 They're running language is just Morse code.
00:54:22 I mean, we, it's only scribbles, so we never see actual real writing, I guess.
00:54:28 But we do, so you do see real writing in, in the, in the movie, though.
00:54:33 We do.
00:54:33 So, but they didn't, they weren't typing anything.
00:54:36 They have smart voice dictation.
00:54:38 They can just be like, Hey, Siri, I just turned on all your phones.
00:54:41 Yeah.
00:54:41 Wait, why, why do they have a smartphone that looks like that?
00:54:44 When they have hooves that press the entire screen at once.
00:54:47 Yeah.
00:54:47 Right.
00:54:48 Well, I mean, their hooves do some magical things throughout the whole movie.
00:54:51 They're in the future.
00:54:52 I guess I could use their nose.
00:54:53 There's no longer like distinct actions that you have to press on the phone.
00:54:56 You just press the screen to interact.
00:54:58 Just press screen, interact.
00:54:59 Ooh, get my interactions.
00:55:01 Whoo.
00:55:02 Yeah, it's just, it's just, you could go live or you could buy
00:55:05 like a new fucking crystals for your, just press the screen.
00:55:10 A cow clicker.
00:55:11 I like how they like, they put enough design sense to like have like a little
00:55:15 like a slot on the back of all the screens, like for like hooves.
00:55:19 It's like a reverse pop socket kind of thing.
00:55:22 Yeah.
00:55:22 Well, what is a slot on the back of all the screens?
00:55:26 Yeah, there's a slight event where all the phones and tablets have a
00:55:29 little slot on the back that your hoof goes into so it doesn't fall off.
00:55:32 And I'm just like, it's funny that they do that for like that one object,
00:55:37 but then like the rest of the objects functionality completely falls apart.
00:55:39 Well, yeah, because if you rewatch the beginning, you know,
00:55:42 Sonny is on her roller blades, right?
00:55:44 Oh, right.
00:55:45 The roller blade just attaches to the back of the truck, that trolley car or whatever.
00:55:49 And she's just touching a wheel to it.
00:55:51 And she's somehow being pulled.
00:55:53 It was, it was, I think it was so drawing because that was like dead center
00:55:57 in the frame and it's just like, you can't miss this little like, yep.
00:56:01 We're not going to explain how this works.
00:56:03 Don't worry about it.
00:56:04 No, I prefer that.
00:56:05 I like when objects just stick to the ponies who?
00:56:07 Yeah, I think it's hilarious.
00:56:09 I was like, when, when Izzy puts on her glasses and she like flips the glasses
00:56:13 on the glass like the edge of the glasses, she's holding like slides up her
00:56:17 hoof as it goes on to her head.
00:56:19 And I'm just like, I don't know how that works.
00:56:21 But yeah, you know, it's awesome.
00:56:23 Friendship is magic.
00:56:24 I love it. Yeah.
00:56:28 Friendship is magic.
00:56:29 And that's why I can hitch to this.
00:56:30 Yeah, yeah, you know, was it a truck or something?
00:56:32 The magic of friendship keeps the magic of friendship and let me hitch a ride.
00:56:35 Sure. Why not?
00:56:37 This might be a this might be a CinemaSins ding moment.
00:56:41 And it would be if it didn't go on for so long and bother me so much
00:56:47 because like just because it went on for like 15 minutes straight,
00:56:51 which is the scene towards the beginning of the movie where Izzy shows up
00:56:55 and all of the all of the earth ponies are running away, screaming
00:57:00 and they do the joke that's like Izzy is clearly just standing there,
00:57:04 going like hello and like everyone which basically like their their senses go.
00:57:10 They can no longer see or hear or think.
00:57:12 Yeah. Thoughts like it's like if you were using your eyes slash ears,
00:57:17 you would see what's in front of you, which is just someone going hello.
00:57:21 And they run away screaming.
00:57:22 And if they did that joke one time, I get it.
00:57:25 Like I get that joke is like a common trope.
00:57:28 Yeah, but it goes on for actually 15 minutes happening.
00:57:31 And so I was like that scene was like the whole start of the movie.
00:57:34 And yeah, it got a little it got a little obnoxious.
00:57:36 But like you're supposed to be you're supposed to be a little kid in the theater.
00:57:41 And you're supposed to see that and be like, wow,
00:57:43 all these ponies sure are foolish for being racist.
00:57:45 If it were me, I would just be normal.
00:57:47 I would say I would say I would say I would say I would simply accept the foreigner.
00:57:52 I would simply accept the harmless foreigner into my side, but whatever, you know,
00:57:56 do we think that the racism allegory works in this movie?
00:58:02 I mean, my answer is I don't know.
00:58:06 I guess like it's like probably probably I'm going to say I could tell
00:58:09 I could tell what they were going for deep into the into the G four thing,
00:58:13 as we all were as someone who is deeply racist myself.
00:58:17 I guess I did not see myself reflected in the in the politics of this movie.
00:58:21 It's just like a lot of the like questions
00:58:24 like the fan theorizing or just like speculation, like half for the lulls was
00:58:28 just like, like, why why are all these people equal when earth ponies are clearly
00:58:32 like at a disadvantage, you know, like that was kind of like the question
00:58:36 you'd ask watching G four, like everyone's just friends.
00:58:38 But like, you know, like, wouldn't there be some like tension of like, man,
00:58:41 you can do magic and I just dig in the dirt and like just ask as a joke, you know.
00:58:46 But like it was the point of the show was like they kind of transcended those kind of things.
00:58:50 And so like it almost feels like going back and being like, hey,
00:58:54 everyone's divided into it.
00:58:55 It feels like the more obvious take with with this kind of setting.
00:58:59 So like it felt almost like a step backwards, I guess.
00:59:02 But the reason the whole point is like we're getting back to that point already.
00:59:06 Like that's the whole point of this movie is to get us back to status quo.
00:59:09 So like I was kind of not invested in any of that because like all this world
00:59:13 building is like going to be irrelevant by the end of the movie anyways.
00:59:17 I mean, I guess the show then will be about them like learning to live together
00:59:23 and get along as now that they've they've been separated for.
00:59:26 Will they?
00:59:27 I'm not sure if I guess I wonder if she's going to go back to status quo.
00:59:31 I don't know if we know this.
00:59:34 I would assume so.
00:59:35 I mean, this this movie is like this is like the setup.
00:59:38 This is like the pilot for the new show.
00:59:41 Is the show going to look like that?
00:59:43 I don't think it'll look good.
00:59:44 Well, it's not going to be as high effort.
00:59:46 But is it going to be the same aesthetic?
00:59:48 In the same way?
00:59:49 I believe so.
00:59:50 Yeah, I don't I don't know if it's been 100 percent confirmed,
00:59:53 but I felt like it's a fair assumption thing with the with with the stuff
00:59:57 with everybody screaming was actually pretty good.
01:00:00 I didn't feel like anything was like bad with the I felt like it went on.
01:00:05 I mean, maybe I was like the screaming the screaming was happening.
01:00:09 But like the stuff.
01:00:12 I was getting a little annoyed.
01:00:13 I was getting the stuff was like, you know,
01:00:16 it's first Izzy is there and then Sonny sees Izzy.
01:00:21 She realizes that Izzy is not dangerous
01:00:24 when other people still continue to not realize that then people have to go after them.
01:00:29 She protects her and then she gets captured.
01:00:31 Izzy gets captured and then she decides to free her,
01:00:34 thus becoming a criminal.
01:00:35 All these different things happen.
01:00:36 Meanwhile, everyone's doing the screaming thing.
01:00:39 So I guess it does go on for a while.
01:00:41 But like the stuff that's happening, I feel like the pacing was quite good.
01:00:44 No, I agree. I think it was and and you know,
01:00:47 you imagine this is a society where all these earth ponies have spent
01:00:51 their entire lives being indoctrinated into the fear of these these terrible
01:00:56 creatures that can fry your brain with with, you know, nary a thought with.
01:01:01 Oh, yeah. Of course, they're scared.
01:01:03 You know, that's the idea.
01:01:05 They're supposed to be senseless.
01:01:07 And they sort of they tie that in again, right?
01:01:09 With the angry mob song where it's like, don't use your brain.
01:01:12 Just follow me brainlessly.
01:01:14 Right. If you use your brain, the unicorn can fry it.
01:01:17 Yeah.
01:01:18 Leave your brain at home so they can't get it.
01:01:22 It's the only way.
01:01:24 Yeah, I try to go a little bit.
01:01:26 I know that's what they were going for.
01:01:27 I think it was good. Yeah.
01:01:31 Also, I wanted to mention the reason in in Gen four
01:01:35 that that question of like who's actually why they friends is was funny
01:01:39 because of the fact that there were certain animals that they had
01:01:43 as livestock, but could also talk to cows.
01:01:48 Yeah.
01:01:49 But then other animals that they could talk to were not livestock.
01:01:53 And what do they all think about that?
01:01:55 What are they?
01:01:56 And then some livestock they can't talk to is like, OK.
01:02:00 OK. It's funny.
01:02:01 It's it was funny in the movie.
01:02:03 All right. I guess there was a thing where like Hitch is like has animal empathy
01:02:08 skills and like I just totally missed it and I didn't I didn't even notice.
01:02:12 No, I thought that was quite clever.
01:02:14 He just they kept bringing that back because he's got like the two birds
01:02:17 in the crab at the beginning.
01:02:18 Yeah, just little critters inexplicably love them.
01:02:20 That's all. Yeah.
01:02:21 And he's like kind of an enemy dog becomes the friendly dog.
01:02:25 It's like, yeah, the enemy, the enemy dog.
01:02:28 Toby Fox, Toby Fox, I thought Toby Fox, it was Toby Fox.
01:02:32 I'm not sure if that's like if that's supposed to be an earth pony magic thing.
01:02:36 But no, I thought it was weird.
01:02:38 I think it was just a hitch thing.
01:02:39 Yeah, you can't use the Fluttershy.
01:02:42 He's what Fluttershy was a cop.
01:02:44 Yeah.
01:02:46 The the yellow.
01:02:48 It's funny how like this, you know, they don't get any magic.
01:02:51 You know, when magic is restored, it's like Pegasus I can fly unicorn
01:02:54 skinny magic and it's like it's they say it a couple times at first.
01:02:57 Sunny is says it.
01:02:58 It's like, oh, wow, wouldn't it be great to have a friend who was magic
01:03:02 to have a friend that can fly?
01:03:03 Yeah, it's like it's like what earth ponies get by restoring that?
01:03:07 They don't get anything themselves.
01:03:08 But what they get is the blessing of like they know they can have friends
01:03:12 who have power. Sunny knew the whole time
01:03:17 that if she could con the earth ponies and to bring back the magic,
01:03:20 she would get both.
01:03:21 That's why she was on board from the beginning.
01:03:23 I mean, they they they allude to it right away.
01:03:25 Right. She breaks into a counter logic.
01:03:28 They throw the the wings and the horn on her.
01:03:31 Yeah. Oh, my God, they do.
01:03:34 Oh, my God.
01:03:35 She was like, yeah, foreshadowing foreshadowing.
01:03:38 It's not. I noticed that on my second rewatch or my first,
01:03:41 I guess that's the first kind of interesting, I suppose.
01:03:43 That's a bit that's a bit of a dramatic irony.
01:03:46 Dude, it's like they set things up cleverly.
01:03:49 Oh, my God. And oh, my God, the letter.
01:03:51 Oh, my God, she found the letter.
01:03:54 True. You know, I'm pretty good.
01:03:56 All right, movie, you got me.
01:03:58 You got you got me. It's a 10 now.
01:04:01 It is my story.
01:04:03 My score is steadily rising on my I am I.
01:04:06 Yeah, it was just it was just good.
01:04:09 I found myself just smiling, smiling just like, you know what?
01:04:14 This is a fucking this is a good time.
01:04:15 Oh, the conversation is silly.
01:04:17 This is dumb. This is fun.
01:04:19 When she sits down at the bar
01:04:21 and she's talking to the the unicorn bartender.
01:04:24 Yes, I just like my favorite design.
01:04:27 But I remember thinking that it was very funny.
01:04:29 Their dialogue was pretty. It was good.
01:04:31 You know, like is when the bartender is like, you know,
01:04:33 it's big talk for a little pony and she's like,
01:04:35 I think you'll find I'm average, right?
01:04:37 Like, that's funny. Yeah.
01:04:39 That got that got a laugh out of me.
01:04:41 I like that guy. I like that they do DDR.
01:04:44 It is very much like they're going to do it.
01:04:46 And it's going to be like, oh, she's going to get her ass kicked.
01:04:49 And then she's going to win the third round, maybe.
01:04:50 OK, OK. And she well, I it's funny that they do DDR.
01:04:55 But I it sucked a little bit
01:04:57 because like she doesn't win by any like clever scheme.
01:05:01 She doesn't. There's no.
01:05:02 She just kind of gets the hang of it.
01:05:03 It's like, it's like, why does why does she?
01:05:05 OK, she she enters into this bet
01:05:07 that she has like no hope of winning.
01:05:10 But then she just she just happens to be really good at it.
01:05:13 To be fair, she enters into the bag under the assumption
01:05:16 she's going to solve the Rubik's cube.
01:05:17 And she's like, I know how to solve Rubik's cubes.
01:05:20 Really good guys. Don't worry.
01:05:21 I mean, first of all, first of all, it's totally unfair for him to be like,
01:05:25 no, no, no, no, actually, we're going to do a different.
01:05:26 It is unfair. And what you challenged me for.
01:05:28 No, I should have an option to dip out at that point.
01:05:30 But yeah. And then there's like, and it's like, OK,
01:05:34 well, actually, we're going to do DDR.
01:05:36 And actually, you only have to beat me one time out of three
01:05:39 just because it's I don't know.
01:05:41 It just felt like no, I don't even have to work, but it's totally arbitrary.
01:05:44 I thought the guy was characterized beforehand.
01:05:46 It's pretty poisonous and sure of himself.
01:05:48 They should have set something up with with with either
01:05:52 her wanting to be good at dancing, but not being very good.
01:05:55 Yeah, I can't dance or the earth ponies just have happy feet.
01:06:00 That would have been cool.
01:06:01 That's the end scene.
01:06:02 I mean, I have a happy, glowy feet and that's how she won.
01:06:07 Well, I thought I thought.
01:06:08 Yeah, if she just happens, I thought Zip was going to come in and win it
01:06:11 because like Zip was like seeing was like being characterized in the background
01:06:15 as like being like competent at that.
01:06:16 And I thought she was going to jump in and like win.
01:06:19 I feel like it didn't do anything.
01:06:21 I feel like it came out of thinking like, what was Zip even here for?
01:06:24 I mean, Zip was like the info dump about the station, I guess.
01:06:29 I just have no, I have no impression at all of Zip as a character.
01:06:33 She's the rainbow dash lookalike with the like, like,
01:06:38 but like she's studious.
01:06:40 I guess she's smart.
01:06:41 I'm you, I'm you, but I like she's, but she's not even insane.
01:06:45 That's the thing.
01:06:46 She doesn't have like a weird, not.
01:06:48 Not even insane need to be slightly insane to be funny and cool.
01:06:52 Twilight was completely insane.
01:06:54 But Zip is like rainbow dash, but without the, you know, the the the radical.
01:07:02 She didn't have this is not real anxiety that she's she's not like she's not like
01:07:08 athletic, she's not like strong or anything.
01:07:10 She's just kind of there.
01:07:12 Well, she could be.
01:07:13 We just didn't really see any example of that in the film.
01:07:15 She didn't she didn't do anything.
01:07:17 She didn't do anything.
01:07:18 And Pip, all Pip does is be obnoxious and be on her phone.
01:07:21 I kind of be on your phone.
01:07:22 I kind of be on your phone.
01:07:24 The worst I like Sony and I like the Instagram pony.
01:07:28 I don't care.
01:07:28 Sonny and Izzy are the only important ones.
01:07:30 Also, they're gay, by the way.
01:07:31 They're they're gay.
01:07:32 Sonny and Izzy are gay.
01:07:33 I would I would say that's probably true.
01:07:36 All right, print it.
01:07:37 I would say that that's canon.
01:07:38 That's it.
01:07:39 So who's best pony and why is it Izzy?
01:07:42 Because she's so cute.
01:07:43 I mean, it's I mean, it's got Izzy's the one who has the most
01:07:47 because because when she leaves the prison, she chuckles really
01:07:51 devilishly by replacing an orange with the tennis ball.
01:07:54 Yes, she thinks it's hilarious, but it's like not that good of a prank,
01:07:58 but she thinks it's so funny.
01:08:00 I she just puts it in the box and she's like,
01:08:04 wouldn't it be funny if I swap them because they're both spheres?
01:08:08 And then nothing comes of it.
01:08:09 She just thinks it's funny.
01:08:11 Just just thinks it's funny.
01:08:12 And yeah.
01:08:13 And the tennis ball is a pretty funny visual game.
01:08:16 Yeah, it is pretty funny.
01:08:18 And then in that moment, it's extra funny
01:08:20 because it's clear that she could have taken it off immediately at any time.
01:08:24 Just chooses not to.
01:08:25 She just did.
01:08:26 Izzy, like, never, you know, a lot of the jokes in this movie
01:08:33 did not make me laugh and didn't like land necessarily.
01:08:37 But like whenever Izzy made a joke, I never groaned or anything.
01:08:41 I was just like, I didn't laugh, but I still love you, Izzy.
01:08:45 Yeah, like she was never annoying.
01:08:49 She never annoyed me.
01:08:50 She was always either funny or just like, I can't wait to work three seasons in
01:08:55 and they just dial Izzy up to twelve like they did with Pinkie Pie
01:08:58 and just make it obnoxious.
01:08:59 Yes. Oh, I'm sure they will.
01:09:01 When will they flander eyes?
01:09:03 When will they flander eyes, Izzy?
01:09:04 The countdown begins.
01:09:07 Dude, did you see how they fucking plagiarized
01:09:10 Beljap at the end where they're trying to get the jewels,
01:09:15 but they keep falling off and they're like, oh, I've got to catch the jewel.
01:09:18 That's right. The end of Beljap.
01:09:19 Remember that? Yeah, yeah.
01:09:21 The jewel of Splish falls into the lava.
01:09:23 They have to go, oh, shit, it's falling.
01:09:25 Oh, they slippery. Oh, these jewels are so slippery.
01:09:27 Why can't I hold only we had hands?
01:09:30 Yeah, fuck.
01:09:32 Holy spike was here.
01:09:34 If they if they had hands, I'm so glad there isn't a spike.
01:09:37 Thank fuck. Me, too.
01:09:39 I'm also glad there's no spike.
01:09:41 I guess like hitch it. Hitch is the spike.
01:09:44 Yeah, you're right.
01:09:46 I'm not kidding. He is.
01:09:47 It's like one of Spike and Fluttershy and Big Magnetage
01:09:50 and a boy character was a cop.
01:09:54 He's the he's the one guy who sucks.
01:09:56 And he's he's plays the spike.
01:09:59 No, I liked him.
01:10:01 I thought he was all right. I didn't mind hitch.
01:10:02 I hated Sprout.
01:10:03 Fuck hitch. The thing I did like about
01:10:06 is that he's like he's like not for the reasons they want me to hate him.
01:10:09 ACAB means hitch, too.
01:10:11 Hmm. ACAB includes that.
01:10:14 I never liked Spike or like I couldn't find
01:10:17 myself to like Spike is is that he's just he's just the little nagging voice
01:10:23 that's always next is that he's a sidekick.
01:10:25 He's like a Robin to a Batman.
01:10:27 He's like, oh, geez.
01:10:29 Oh, wow.
01:10:31 Twilight is like a good line.
01:10:33 At least is his own character.
01:10:36 Oh, geez, Sonny, I can't wait to put you in jail when we get home.
01:10:40 We're all we're all going to jail after this, by the way.
01:10:44 At least he's an environmentally conscious.
01:10:46 Yeah, you know, this friendship thing is really cool and all,
01:10:49 but I really got to get you back and put you in jail, Sonny.
01:10:53 Hitch, jail is magic.
01:10:56 The the the the punitive justice system is magic.
01:11:02 Everyone, everyone brings something to the table in this ragtag band
01:11:06 of misfits and hitch is that you can do paperwork,
01:11:10 process you through the penal system and to get you and get you get you
01:11:15 sorted out, a special guy removed from society with a minimum of fuss.
01:11:22 Everybody's got a super special talent.
01:11:24 If he's going to be like in the show is like one of the the main group
01:11:27 and he's the sheriff, what what would that like?
01:11:32 What it's like having the mayor there as one of the main troop.
01:11:36 Yeah, what is going to even happen?
01:11:38 They can be like, Hitch, don't tell him.
01:11:40 He'll be like, OK, you were like you were right last time.
01:11:43 So what he what he brings to the group is that he can he could get you
01:11:47 and he can get you out of jail.
01:11:48 He could just be like, no, I just won't prosecute this crime that you commit.
01:11:51 What is going to be is going to be like doing that illusion with this position
01:11:55 of power as he continues to go.
01:11:57 Or that's true.
01:11:58 I was just going to be learning.
01:12:00 Learning that you can't quit.
01:12:01 Like, yeah. Oh, she's character.
01:12:04 You can't do that. I'm the sheriff, you know, I get.
01:12:08 Oh, I don't like this.
01:12:10 I don't like this gun.
01:12:11 They probably won't acknowledge it at all.
01:12:13 It'll probably just like be a thing that's ignored.
01:12:16 Yeah, he'll just be a guy.
01:12:19 He'll put Sprout in charge for real.
01:12:23 I mean, it worked out so well this this time.
01:12:25 It's true. I like that Sprout was just Josh Scorcher.
01:12:30 I also.
01:12:33 He's the best character now.
01:12:34 The same.
01:12:36 He acts the same to.
01:12:37 Yes, correct.
01:12:41 I want to see Josh Scorcher's review of the movie and see if he goes.
01:12:46 I can't wait to see the new and improved analysis.
01:12:50 Anarchy was using 3D models that don't animate.
01:12:53 They just glide around the 3D pony maker.
01:12:58 Like you rotate it, take a picture.
01:13:01 I just find it I find it funny because like up and up until the release of this
01:13:05 movie, I'd always been like saying like I even if I don't like this,
01:13:10 I can't wait for the chaos because like it's going to be like
01:13:13 a Star Trek original series versus Star Trek the next generation.
01:13:17 The fandom is going to fracture and there's going to be people on each side.
01:13:19 And just as someone who's been in the shit long enough to understand
01:13:23 the inevitable arguments, it'll be fun just to watch from the sidelines.
01:13:26 And then they literally called the fucking show a new generation.
01:13:30 And I'm just like, it's so perfect.
01:13:31 It's like poetry. They rhyme.
01:13:33 There's already people bitching about it.
01:13:35 And it's really funny.
01:13:35 There's some account that has like 200 subscribers or 200 followers on Twitter
01:13:39 called like Save MLP G4.
01:13:41 And they're running a change.org position to get this show canceled
01:13:44 and get the finale of G4 rescinded.
01:13:47 Bro, it's not that serious.
01:13:49 Chris Chan was all about that.
01:13:51 No, see, they lost their figure.
01:13:53 Chris Chan was trying to promote that before it went to jail for reasons
01:13:57 that we don't have to get into. As long as Chris is in jail.
01:14:00 As long as Chris is in jail, it's all over.
01:14:03 It's as long as as long as Chris is in jail, we're safe.
01:14:06 By the way, this is unrelated, but did you see the letter
01:14:08 that she wrote from prison?
01:14:10 Oh, my God.
01:14:11 The letter. Why? What?
01:14:12 The letter wherein?
01:14:13 The letter is insane.
01:14:15 The letter is the Jesus Christ.
01:14:17 Do you believe that's the West Sea?
01:14:18 Just like I am Jesus Christ reincarnated.
01:14:21 I am like, please, please draw a fan art of me on the cross, please.
01:14:27 It reads exactly like I completely identically to like a caliber and rant.
01:14:35 And this is the person.
01:14:36 This is the biggest proponent of like, bring back G4.
01:14:39 No, G5.
01:14:40 Yeah, it's so.
01:14:41 She's the biggest in here.
01:14:42 It's so fairly strange.
01:14:44 Yeah.
01:14:46 So it's so weird that Chris would say something bizarre.
01:14:49 It's so weird that it's bizarre.
01:14:52 Like, obviously it's going to be bizarre.
01:14:54 She thinks stupid, insane things.
01:14:56 But it's like the way it's written is so dramatic.
01:15:00 Yeah.
01:15:01 That it's like how I didn't know they could write like that.
01:15:06 Like that dramatically.
01:15:08 It was gripping.
01:15:09 I was I was totally engaged.
01:15:10 She writes almost as though it's like biblical as like it's like say say unto
01:15:16 me like like like do unto me that like thy thy duty.
01:15:22 Also, I need like five hundred dollars transferred to my bank account, please.
01:15:31 The.
01:15:33 Oh, OK, sorry to derail the conversation.
01:15:36 I was just I just forgot about that.
01:15:38 And I just remembered gripping stuff truly, truly a miracle.
01:15:44 Right. But anyway, we got to bring back G4.
01:15:46 We got to sign the petition.
01:15:48 We have to undo the finale.
01:15:50 Twilight can't be a long legged freak.
01:15:52 She's got to go back to be in a cute little pony.
01:15:55 It is.
01:15:56 Chop our legs off.
01:15:58 Job. Definitely chop her legs off.
01:16:01 We got to we got to like cotton.
01:16:02 We got to like cotton hill her ass.
01:16:04 If you know what I'm saying, this letter chop chop her shins off at the knee.
01:16:10 So her hooves to her knees.
01:16:14 What? That's what that's that's what Hank Hill.
01:16:17 That's what happened to Hank Hill's dad.
01:16:19 That's why his dad is short because they shot his shins off and they just
01:16:22 sewed his feet to his knees.
01:16:27 That's what you got to do.
01:16:30 OK, totally unnecessary.
01:16:32 So we're getting we're getting off time here.
01:16:35 But thank you. Yeah.
01:16:39 What are we talking about?
01:16:40 My little pony, the movie, the new generation.
01:16:42 10 out of 10.
01:16:43 Do we have anything else to say about the movie?
01:16:48 I liked the song at the beginning.
01:16:50 I like the songs in the middle.
01:16:51 I like the songs of the end.
01:16:52 I like all the songs.
01:16:54 Oh, the pacing of the songs is great.
01:16:56 I thought it was perfect.
01:16:59 I didn't think any of the songs really stuck with me that much.
01:17:02 I like the mob song because it was so stupid.
01:17:04 It was funny, but it was like that on purpose.
01:17:07 None of the other songs really did anything for me.
01:17:09 I'm being swayed.
01:17:10 I'll bump my score up to like a six.
01:17:12 Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.
01:17:14 I have things that I liked.
01:17:18 I also this movie isn't for me.
01:17:20 It was much better than I was expecting.
01:17:22 I haven't seen the 2017 movie since it came out.
01:17:25 So I don't know if it's better.
01:17:27 Was that the 2D one?
01:17:28 Yeah, the actual like My Little Pony movie, the G4 movie.
01:17:32 Not a question.
01:17:33 Did I watch that?
01:17:33 The actual one.
01:17:36 The one that wasn't a fucking dumpster fighter.
01:17:39 Well, no, no, no.
01:17:40 I mean, OK, I remember now.
01:17:43 As compared to the Equestria Girls movies,
01:17:45 which are all living nightmares.
01:17:48 That's true.
01:17:49 I don't know if it's better than that one
01:17:51 because I haven't watched that one in a million years.
01:17:53 What, the 2017?
01:17:54 Yeah, I don't remember anything about it.
01:17:56 Oh, no, it's Dreadful.
01:17:57 Is it? Which which movie?
01:17:59 I don't remember it being the Dreadful.
01:17:59 Oh, the one where they go on the.
01:18:01 The one where they go to Aladdin
01:18:02 and then they go to the Sea Ponies
01:18:04 and then there's Pirate Parrots and it's like
01:18:07 there's too many things.
01:18:08 They don't spend enough time on anything.
01:18:10 None of the character,
01:18:11 none of the main six gets enough of screen time
01:18:14 to like really have anything to do.
01:18:16 My initial reaction was that this is better,
01:18:19 but I can't say for sure because I haven't seen it.
01:18:22 And then there was there was the fucking
01:18:23 there was the fucking Lion King fart guy.
01:18:26 The fucking Gremlin like minion,
01:18:29 blue minion, little rare.
01:18:31 I'm a fucking asshole, annoying piece of shit
01:18:35 from the line. Of course.
01:18:37 There is there.
01:18:37 And also, there is when Twilight gets like captured or whatever,
01:18:41 the like lava place that she's in looks exactly like
01:18:44 when you fight King Caliente for the second time in Mario Galaxy.
01:18:50 Look it up, you'll get it.
01:18:51 And that's why you've all been there.
01:18:54 Playing Mario Galaxy, everybody.
01:18:56 It's just like it's just like like metal hexagons over lava
01:19:00 or something.
01:19:02 That's what made me think of it.
01:19:03 I need to get a picture of that Gremlin guy
01:19:06 because he was so annoying.
01:19:07 I think I know who you're talking about.
01:19:08 When I say Lion King, there was like that Lion King reboot
01:19:12 like TV show. Oh, yeah.
01:19:14 From the Lion Guard.
01:19:16 The Lion Guard.
01:19:17 Tom, you made a video about Lion Guard.
01:19:18 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:19:19 I still get comments on it to this day
01:19:21 saying how wrong I am in the show.
01:19:23 No, that's how you do it.
01:19:25 That guy and that guy is this like spiritual
01:19:28 successor to Skunk Freak is in the Milo Pony 2017.
01:19:34 I would say that.
01:19:35 And he's a villain.
01:19:36 I would say that Western animation fans are the lowest of the low
01:19:40 and just the worst kind of person.
01:19:44 And you should never listen to them.
01:19:46 Well, why? Why?
01:19:47 OK, Phantom Horn.
01:19:49 You should never listen to me.
01:19:52 My last mistake was getting into the pony show.
01:19:56 And it's all just it's all been downhill from there for me.
01:19:59 So don't don't be like me.
01:20:01 The pony show is taken up like a quarter of my life, at least.
01:20:05 Easily. And and what a quarter it was.
01:20:08 I was 12 and 2010.
01:20:10 Oh, my God.
01:20:12 Is that one pony started?
01:20:13 Is that when Gen Four came out?
01:20:15 Yeah. Yeah. Cool.
01:20:18 So I was probably like
01:20:20 here under under the evil doer thing.
01:20:23 Here he is.
01:20:25 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that guy.
01:20:27 Oh, this. Oh, I forget him.
01:20:34 Yeah, I do love how there's a villain wiki.
01:20:37 It's really funny to me.
01:20:39 This is this is this guy.
01:20:42 Isn't there someone who looks exactly like the quote?
01:20:45 Oh, that's what you're talking about, right?
01:20:47 Yeah, he looks exactly like that porcupine or whatever.
01:20:50 Yeah, I don't even.
01:20:51 Yeah, I look at the quote.
01:20:53 Oh, I love pie.
01:20:54 Lots of rubbers, most famous line.
01:20:57 Oh, I love you go, brother.
01:21:00 Oh, I love pie.
01:21:02 What a great fill.
01:21:04 God, the wiki community is what a memorable character.
01:21:08 Whatever. Barry.
01:21:08 What a Barry Fizzle sparkle twist.
01:21:10 Was the name of what's her name at the end?
01:21:13 That's a little whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle,
01:21:16 Bibi Babis, snap, crackle, pop.
01:21:21 I liked I liked that pony a little bit.
01:21:24 I thought she was all right.
01:21:25 Right. Tempest, Shadow, Alias,
01:21:28 Fizzle, Pop, Barry, Twist, that's a very twist.
01:21:31 I thought that was a funny little twist at the end.
01:21:34 Remember when they turn that guy to stone
01:21:35 and he just falls over and they shatter him into pieces
01:21:37 and he just fucking dies right on screen?
01:21:39 Remember when they killed a guy?
01:21:41 Yeah, that was awesome.
01:21:44 Then kill anyone in this movie.
01:21:46 What the fuck? They should have.
01:21:48 They should have killed him.
01:21:49 What's his name?
01:21:51 They should have killed the Josh Scorcher character.
01:21:53 Skit, Sprout. Sprout.
01:21:56 You needed. Yeah.
01:21:57 Was I a good fucking sheriff?
01:22:00 Mom. They should have killed the mom.
01:22:02 Die. Mom just pulls out a gun.
01:22:04 They should have killed the Silicon Valley milf.
01:22:07 Absolutely.
01:22:08 They should have. She's a milf, though.
01:22:10 You can't do that.
01:22:11 You can't go around killing milfs.
01:22:12 Oh, we go. You could.
01:22:14 Oh, you just call me the milf hunter, I guess.
01:22:18 No one gets redeemed.
01:22:20 You're good at your body.
01:22:21 Die, Pony.
01:22:23 You got to drop off the side of a building like Gaston.
01:22:26 Yeah, you don't you don't kill him.
01:22:28 You don't kill him.
01:22:28 Yeah, they fall to their death, death. Yeah.
01:22:31 Yeah, one presumes that they perished due to nobody's.
01:22:35 No one's fault.
01:22:36 It's just now they double jump when right at the bottom.
01:22:40 They roll. They hit roll right before.
01:22:42 Yeah, they get no full damage.
01:22:44 They continue.
01:22:44 I'd like a Mufasa death where they fall and then they go down
01:22:47 and like hang out with the body for a while.
01:22:51 Like if it were me, I would simply hit roll
01:22:53 right before hitting the hitting the hitting the ground.
01:22:56 Simba like like sets up like he he he he sets up
01:23:00 like a scuttle bug just the right place.
01:23:03 He goes back in time.
01:23:05 Mufasa bounces off of it.
01:23:05 He sets up a scuttle bug to bounce off of it.
01:23:12 Uh, Simba, why didn't you set up the scuttle bug?
01:23:15 Simba, there's supposed to be a scuttle bug.
01:23:17 No. Watch for the rolling rocks.
01:23:20 Oh, he didn't.
01:23:21 He didn't watch for him.
01:23:23 And look what happened.
01:23:26 Watch the Lion King.
01:23:27 I love the Lion King a whole lot.
01:23:30 You know that.
01:23:30 Why didn't we watch that?
01:23:31 Lion King 2019, what a great movie.
01:23:35 Oh, my God, the Lion King is very important to me.
01:23:38 And the Lion King 2019 is my least favorite movie.
01:23:43 Did you see it?
01:23:44 Of course, I saw it.
01:23:45 Oh, you mean the live action one?
01:23:46 I mean the live action one.
01:23:47 Yeah, the live action one.
01:23:48 The live action full CGI animated again.
01:23:52 Oh, right.
01:23:52 But made exponentially worse.
01:23:55 I only just learned who YMS is
01:23:57 because Munchie was like, you should watch the Kimba video.
01:24:01 And I did.
01:24:02 It was really good.
01:24:02 And yeah, I never watched YMS before,
01:24:05 but I've seen like some of his highlight streams of him editing
01:24:09 his Lion King 2019 video.
01:24:12 And he I was like, I was just overcome
01:24:17 with this feeling of like, finally, there's someone who gives
01:24:20 as much of a shit about the Lion King as me.
01:24:23 Like I've never met anyone who could just fucking talk about it.
01:24:27 He's been making that Lion King video.
01:24:28 He's been working on that Lion King video for like 10 years now.
01:24:32 I'm terrified.
01:24:33 It's so excited how long he's worked on it.
01:24:36 There was I it's going to be like a day long video.
01:24:38 It's going to be like a 20 hour video.
01:24:40 There was there was like a stream highlight where he's discussing,
01:24:44 like, in depth, like, not just the fact that like the music
01:24:48 in the stampede scene is like synced weird, but like why the why it's bad
01:24:54 because there's specific musical cues that they use in the movie
01:24:58 in the original movie that they still leave in the remake.
01:25:02 Like, but they're they happen.
01:25:06 Like nothing is going on.
01:25:08 Yeah, like they they use this instrument to like to basically
01:25:12 like it's just represent that Zazu is flying, but that sound
01:25:18 just appears when Zazu is not even on like on the screen at all.
01:25:22 So and I was like, this is what I think about every day.
01:25:25 This is the only thing I think about is is the the the sinking
01:25:29 of the score and the stampede scene.
01:25:32 Finally, someone's talking about it.
01:25:35 I I see I understand you understand someday.
01:25:40 Maybe it was it was it was good.
01:25:42 I watched that as well where he was going over that.
01:25:44 It's essentially like the cuts and timing
01:25:50 is different, but the music is basically the exactly the same.
01:25:55 And so bits that are supposed to line up with animation and shots.
01:26:00 Like you don't notice it when you're watching,
01:26:02 but when you go over it and be like, oh, that that instrument is going
01:26:07 as they're falling down.
01:26:08 And it's like, oh, that's like it makes it pop more.
01:26:11 Yes, smart.
01:26:13 And then in the new one, they don't do anything smart with that.
01:26:16 Yeah, it'll be like they have like the the because, you know,
01:26:19 when you write a score for a film, you do it intentionally.
01:26:23 So they have a you feel like, yeah, you'll have a doodaloo
01:26:26 when they're falling or something or they're making a face or something.
01:26:29 And then, yeah, it's in the remake.
01:26:30 You you have the doodaloo, but like nothing
01:26:34 is what is happening on screen doesn't relate to nothing.
01:26:37 This doodaloo, doodaloo.
01:26:38 There's no there's no doodaloo, but they're not falling.
01:26:41 So like you it's not why the doodaloo.
01:26:44 So the purpose of the score is like the doodaloo undermined.
01:26:49 I see. I see.
01:26:50 It makes the scene feel really flat and like not.
01:26:53 It's it's so it's so overly in depth, but I can't wait for the big video.
01:26:58 Yeah, where he talks about all of that.
01:27:00 I know I love that shit.
01:27:02 I love that shit so much.
01:27:03 I'm very excited for this video.
01:27:07 The the Kimble.
01:27:08 He just like made the Kimble one like as like an afterthought.
01:27:11 Yeah, but it's like three hour long.
01:27:14 Yeah, yeah, it's I mean, I like that one.
01:27:17 It's very good, good time.
01:27:18 I learned a lot.
01:27:19 I had a lot of fun.
01:27:20 It was fun.
01:27:21 Good time.
01:27:23 You all had a good time was had by all.
01:27:25 There's so many good things in YMS is.
01:27:28 Catalog.
01:27:28 I mean, all I see of him now is yeah, it's I see stream highlights
01:27:32 and him reacting to Darman, which is a whole a whole genre onto itself.
01:27:37 I haven't gotten into watching the Darman things.
01:27:40 I just want the Lion King editing.
01:27:42 I agree.
01:27:43 Give me a Lion King editing, please.
01:27:45 Correct.
01:27:48 But I have seen some Darman shit.
01:27:53 I saw I saw a thumbnail yesterday
01:27:56 that was like YMS reacts to the cringiest,
01:28:00 the cringiest Darman video yet.
01:28:03 And the thumbnail was just YMS just making a face.
01:28:07 And he's like, wow, he's really cringing.
01:28:09 Was it the cringiest one?
01:28:10 Really?
01:28:11 I don't know.
01:28:12 I didn't watch the video.
01:28:12 I just saw the thumbnail and I was like, that is a big cringe.
01:28:15 Report back next week.
01:28:16 It looks like a real cringe.
01:28:17 OK, you got to watch it.
01:28:20 That's what we're all watching reveals.
01:28:23 No, we didn't talk about peeled Pokemon.
01:28:26 Oh, God, yeah.
01:28:28 Yeah, true.
01:28:30 We were looking at peeled Pokemon and we were getting.
01:28:32 I was getting mad.
01:28:33 I don't know what that is.
01:28:34 Some of the peeled sounds dumb.
01:28:36 Have you want to explain?
01:28:37 Have you seen like banana peel?
01:28:38 Have you seen that the peeled Pokemon Twitter account?
01:28:42 No, you know, a peeled Pokemoner.
01:28:43 Oh, here we go.
01:28:44 Cracks got it.
01:28:46 Yeah, it's disgusting.
01:28:47 Is it gross?
01:28:48 What is it?
01:28:48 No, just peeled.
01:28:49 The peels are peeled.
01:28:52 Oh, OK.
01:28:55 I get it.
01:28:56 You've probably seen like peeled dialog.
01:28:57 Next we think of like a potato peeler and that's
01:29:00 that feels like like like like a dangerous.
01:29:03 OK, I'm looking at this.
01:29:05 I don't like the idea of cutting these ears off.
01:29:07 You've probably seen the peeled dialog image floating around
01:29:10 because that one got kind of popular and a few others.
01:29:14 But yeah, me and Ben just scrolled through the entire account
01:29:16 and looked at every single Pokemon and I'm sorry.
01:29:19 I'm sorry.
01:29:20 What the what the fuck is this?
01:29:21 What the fuck is this?
01:29:25 It's a potato.
01:29:26 This is this is just like going too far.
01:29:31 This is like you're not when you peel it.
01:29:34 You when you peel it, you take the extraneous elements off.
01:29:36 You take like the dude.
01:29:37 The very balance pretty good.
01:29:39 You take the doodads off.
01:29:40 You take the extra bits off.
01:29:42 You don't take its limbs off.
01:29:44 You don't remove its arms and legs.
01:29:45 That's not peeling.
01:29:46 That's dismemberment.
01:29:47 That's cruel.
01:29:49 It's an egg.
01:29:49 See that.
01:29:50 See that's peel.
01:29:51 No, that's peeled.
01:29:52 That's an effective peel.
01:29:54 That's a peeled Pokemon.
01:29:55 This this pig egg.
01:29:56 This pig egg is an abomination.
01:29:59 This pig egg is against the spirit of the endeavor.
01:30:02 Is it fair to say that the reason
01:30:03 that you were so mad when we were scrolling through the Twitter
01:30:06 is that like the rules about what you take off
01:30:10 when you peel a Pokemon were very inconsistent.
01:30:13 Yes, like like when he did or when they did,
01:30:17 I guess they they've them pronouns and bio.
01:30:18 When they did the the the Pidgey,
01:30:22 when they did the Pidgey line,
01:30:23 all they did was they took like the bits off
01:30:25 and they took the hair off and they took the stuff.
01:30:27 But it was still recognizably a bird.
01:30:29 It just had its elements removed.
01:30:32 But when they did the one from Gen 5,
01:30:34 I think Pit Pit of and that line.
01:30:37 Yeah, they removed the beak.
01:30:39 They took the beak off.
01:30:40 They took the feet off.
01:30:41 It just turned it into a lump.
01:30:42 But it's like OK.
01:30:43 This is not the you've gone too far.
01:30:45 This doesn't make any sense.
01:30:47 How could you peel his mouth away?
01:30:49 If he does this a lot, they do this a lot.
01:30:51 Yes, that one rule.
01:30:52 They will they will just remove the mouth.
01:30:55 And it's like that's not peeling.
01:30:57 Yeah, you've filled it in.
01:30:59 You filled it in with plaster and then like smoothed it over.
01:31:02 This is the opposite of peeling.
01:31:04 This is insanity.
01:31:05 As we were scrolling.
01:31:07 This is fucking distressing.
01:31:10 I feel like some of these feel like a troll.
01:31:12 Some of these feel like they did them deliberately bad
01:31:14 to make me angry as like a practical joke.
01:31:17 As we were scrolling, like Ben looked away for a second
01:31:20 and we came upon or I came upon this.
01:31:22 Which one is this?
01:31:23 This is Hapodon.
01:31:25 And I was like, Ben, I need you to embrace yourself
01:31:28 because you're going to hate this one the most.
01:31:30 And he did.
01:31:31 Oh, oh, wait.
01:31:33 What's the one Tyranitar?
01:31:36 Tyranitar, for some inexplicable reason,
01:31:38 they they remove some bits and they don't fill the mouth in,
01:31:42 but they just edit the mouth to be closed.
01:31:45 Like they just closed its mouth.
01:31:47 Oh, but the line, the outline of where
01:31:49 they did it, they did it, so it looks like he has a giant
01:31:52 Adam's apple.
01:31:54 Yeah, these are awesome.
01:31:55 I want to find it.
01:31:56 I mean, they're all unique.
01:31:58 I'll give them that.
01:31:59 They're all you never know what they're going to do with it.
01:32:03 I just I do like the account quite a bit.
01:32:06 It's very funny.
01:32:07 I'm sitting over here.
01:32:08 I'm going to find Tyranitar.
01:32:09 Mouth agape.
01:32:12 What?
01:32:13 Someone is doing this.
01:32:15 I just don't understand the appeal.
01:32:17 I know pun intended.
01:32:18 Any the appeal of doing this or consuming this content.
01:32:25 This seems like utterly.
01:32:27 Oh, no, we scroll through the whole thing.
01:32:30 I don't like this.
01:32:31 That's Kyogre, right?
01:32:33 They just go out of everything.
01:32:34 Those are the worst ones.
01:32:35 No, look at Groudon.
01:32:36 Get Groudon.
01:32:37 Look what they did to Groudon.
01:32:38 It's inexplicable.
01:32:39 What they did with Groudon doesn't make any fucking sense at all.
01:32:42 It's just a line.
01:32:44 That's not right.
01:32:45 This person just not right.
01:32:47 I like to think that this person has no object permanence.
01:32:50 And whenever they remove something,
01:32:51 they can't fathom that there would be stuff behind it.
01:32:54 So they just take it.
01:32:56 This person just can't think in 3D.
01:32:59 They can't think that if I take an element off,
01:33:02 there could be some body behind it.
01:33:03 This is like this one.
01:33:05 Groudon looks like a shrimp's hard outer thing
01:33:10 that you peel off before you eat the shrimp.
01:33:14 But this is off the peel, rather than it's been peeled
01:33:19 and this is what's left.
01:33:20 This is a picture off the peel.
01:33:22 I kind of like this one.
01:33:23 I kind of like lunatone.
01:33:24 I don't want to rag on this person.
01:33:26 I think that they're doing it on purpose,
01:33:28 and it's supposed to be stupid.
01:33:30 I think.
01:33:31 But it's also fun to get mad at it and be like, what is this?
01:33:35 You broke your rule from earlier that you don't remove the beats.
01:33:40 I think that they are not a good artist,
01:33:44 and they can't think in 3D very well,
01:33:45 and they are genuinely just kind of like, I said they.
01:33:49 No, I just said damn, that's scathing.
01:33:52 Yeah, well, I think they're kind of bad.
01:33:55 I mean, they're making it work, but I also
01:33:56 think there is an element of like some of them
01:34:00 are just bad on purpose.
01:34:01 Now this person rules.
01:34:02 Just because, like, Lamal.
01:34:04 This person rules.
01:34:04 Oh my god.
01:34:05 What is this?
01:34:07 What the fuck were they thinking?
01:34:09 What are they fucking doing to me with this nonsense?
01:34:13 I have no idea what this black dot is.
01:34:15 It's a ooze.
01:34:17 Is it like Kabuto?
01:34:20 Yes.
01:34:21 Oh, I have the number.
01:34:22 So give your guesses.
01:34:25 I actually don't know.
01:34:27 Is it something with like a shell,
01:34:30 and this is like just its face you can see under the shell,
01:34:33 right?
01:34:34 Oh, it's fucking cradley.
01:34:36 What?
01:34:37 Oh my god.
01:34:39 Yeah.
01:34:41 The object permanence.
01:34:43 They didn't just make it like that.
01:34:44 It should obviously have another eye.
01:34:45 It should obviously have another eye on the other side.
01:34:47 You don't see it from this angle.
01:34:48 You should be able to see just a little bit.
01:34:49 You don't see it from this angle.
01:34:51 It shouldn't be entirely hidden.
01:34:53 No, I'm proud of them.
01:34:55 They got the object permanence.
01:34:56 They made it a whole sphere instead of like the bit
01:35:01 that you can see through the fake mouth.
01:35:05 Look at this.
01:35:05 Look at this.
01:35:07 Yes.
01:35:08 Like, obviously that's not what their mouth should look like.
01:35:12 That obviously that's not what their head would look like
01:35:14 when it's one, why did they close the mouth?
01:35:16 Two, why is their neck sticking out like that?
01:35:19 I'm so mad.
01:35:20 I'm so upset.
01:35:22 I can't believe they would do this.
01:35:24 Feel free to start your own version.
01:35:27 I wish on Pylos' line they removed the fur
01:35:30 and made it some flesh loams.
01:35:33 All right, I've seen survivor done by someone else before.
01:35:36 Like, what if survivor, like, what if you improved survivor
01:35:39 by getting rid of all of it's like too many like things?
01:35:43 It's just a funny squishy snake.
01:35:46 I mean, I never really liked the way they have like
01:35:49 something about the designs sort of uneven.
01:35:52 Is it the way that they're like,
01:35:53 they're permanently like squinched up?
01:35:56 Permanently like crunched? No, no, no, no.
01:35:57 It's about like their, if I get an actual picture.
01:36:02 Okay, I'm gonna show another one that makes me really mad.
01:36:06 This one is like, this is like,
01:36:07 this guy doesn't understand how to think in 3D.
01:36:10 Look at,
01:36:12 There's survivor, but yeah.
01:36:15 I think they did a pretty good job.
01:36:18 Ben, that's a good job.
01:36:19 I think it's just the purple,
01:36:21 the purple is just sort of like kind of random colors.
01:36:25 There's too many a little bit.
01:36:27 I don't know. Oh, yeah.
01:36:28 I always felt it was a little busy
01:36:29 and I could never really get into him.
01:36:31 True. What is this fire dog?
01:36:35 Entei. What is his name? Entei?
01:36:36 Look at Entei, like. I love him.
01:36:38 Why is he a Cyclops?
01:36:40 No, that's a completely insane criticism.
01:36:43 Obviously the point is that he's making it look stupid.
01:36:46 Yeah.
01:36:47 Right? Like they're making it look stupid on purpose.
01:36:50 Ben is thinking it too far.
01:36:52 I think that this artist doesn't understand 3D perspective.
01:36:56 No, no, no, no. I understand, I understand.
01:36:59 I understand that it's supposed to look silly
01:37:00 and it does look silly, but it's like,
01:37:02 well, I feel like you broke your rules here
01:37:04 because clearly this is not,
01:37:05 this is not actually what it would look like
01:37:07 if you feel it.
01:37:08 I think this account was designed for you.
01:37:10 It was designed to make you in particular.
01:37:13 Oh my God, look at this fucking.
01:37:14 That's what I said.
01:37:15 It's all, it's a joke in my.
01:37:16 Broken rules on totodiles.
01:37:19 Why didn't you fill totodiles mouth then, huh?
01:37:22 Why didn't you remove totodiles limbs either?
01:37:24 Inconsistent.
01:37:25 So inconsistent.
01:37:27 It's great, I love it.
01:37:29 If you're listening, I love you.
01:37:33 I don't know who you are.
01:37:34 You're great.
01:37:35 It's just, I look at this, I look at this intake.
01:37:37 Someone should make like actually properly peeled.
01:37:39 I look at this intake.
01:37:40 Consistently peeled Pokemon.
01:37:41 Yeah, yeah, the account is called
01:37:43 consistently peeled Pokemon.
01:37:45 It's like unlike some other accounts.
01:37:46 We obey our own rules.
01:37:48 We stay true to the spirit of the endeavor.
01:37:52 I love the idea that something this stupid
01:37:54 could have drama and a candy.
01:37:57 It's like the people that made the alternative
01:38:00 out of touch Thursdays account that is like
01:38:02 we're out of touch Thursdays,
01:38:03 but unlike the real out of touch Thursdays account,
01:38:05 we just don't ever retweet like Palestinian aid
01:38:09 or anything.
01:38:10 Wait, really?
01:38:11 Yes, yes, there's one that's like we're out,
01:38:13 we're out of touch Thursdays,
01:38:14 but we never do anything political.
01:38:16 Yeah, there are at least two extra
01:38:18 alt out of touch Thursday accounts.
01:38:20 Who's writing that account, Nate?
01:38:23 Probably some dork like him.
01:38:25 Yeah, some stupid motherfucker.
01:38:30 Got him.
01:38:31 Got him.
01:38:34 Anyway, we should do that.
01:38:35 What I'm saying is we should do that to this guy.
01:38:41 Wait, okay, the Wailord rules.
01:38:44 The Gen 3 legendaries were like the worst ones.
01:38:46 Is that Wailord?
01:38:47 Wailord and Wailmer, yeah.
01:38:49 They just closed their mouths.
01:38:50 Why closed their mouths?
01:38:52 Eleazar's gonna have to edit all these in, right?
01:38:55 Oh my God, I mean, he better.
01:38:57 You gotta, every time.
01:38:58 He better.
01:38:59 You gotta.
01:39:01 All right, I'll stop posting them, but yeah.
01:39:03 Funny account.
01:39:04 I've seen enough, I've had enough of this nonsense.
01:39:06 I mean, we looked through the whole thing
01:39:08 and Ben was getting mad.
01:39:10 Ben was like screaming.
01:39:11 I'm still mad, I'm still mad.
01:39:14 Yeah, I was punching holes in the wall.
01:39:15 Yeah, you peed on the floor, you shit on the ceiling.
01:39:19 I shit myself, yeah, I shouldn't come.
01:39:24 You shouldn't come.
01:39:25 Oh, and it was, oh my God, what have they done to Harayama?
01:39:30 What?
01:39:31 Let me see, let me see, plus one more, one more.
01:39:33 One more.
01:39:35 They just, he has gloves on.
01:39:38 They just, they just like peeled back the gloves
01:39:41 and they're the same shape, but skin,
01:39:43 like that doesn't make any sense.
01:39:45 Take his gloves off.
01:39:46 Oh, oh wait, can I?
01:39:47 Yeah, other Pokemon, you take the hands off.
01:39:49 Why not take his hands off?
01:39:50 What do you think this is?
01:39:52 It's not who you think.
01:39:54 Oh, I know who this is.
01:39:55 It's not who you think this is, but I don't fucking know.
01:40:00 You don't know.
01:40:01 No idea.
01:40:03 Any guesses?
01:40:04 I mean, it looks like a Kuna, but it is a Kuna.
01:40:07 I know what it is.
01:40:08 This is Zapdos.
01:40:09 What have they done to my boy?
01:40:15 What have they done to my boy?
01:40:18 Yeah, it looks just like him.
01:40:21 You know those like fetishes that some people have
01:40:24 where it's like you get encased in like goo
01:40:27 and you basically die?
01:40:28 That's what the Snorlax looks like.
01:40:30 He looks like he's been encased.
01:40:35 They got him with the My Little Pony movie,
01:40:38 a goo stroller.
01:40:39 Yes, he looks peacefully dead in this image.
01:40:42 He's resting in peace for real.
01:40:44 He really is, he's resting in peace.
01:40:46 I don't know what's going on with his chin.
01:40:48 I don't know.
01:40:49 His chin line doesn't match up with his headline.
01:40:53 He's just got double chin.
01:40:54 This doesn't make sense.
01:40:55 The dark part is supposed to be the fur
01:40:58 and the belly is supposed to be like the unfurred part.
01:41:02 It should be entirely the belly color.
01:41:05 I got more.
01:41:05 If you're peeling it.
01:41:06 I got more.
01:41:08 It's Magmar.
01:41:09 It's Magmar.
01:41:10 There he is, this is the boy.
01:41:11 It's Magmar, baby.
01:41:13 He's back.
01:41:13 Hey, get her, leave it.
01:41:14 It's better than ever.
01:41:15 What are you going to do about it?
01:41:17 Nothing.
01:41:17 I can't.
01:41:18 It's mutilated Pokemon.
01:41:20 This is terrifying.
01:41:21 I can't, I can't.
01:41:22 It's so good.
01:41:23 I can't have any more.
01:41:24 I can't have any more of this.
01:41:26 I'm feeling like maybe it's time to go to voicemails.
01:41:32 I'm thinking it's time to no more peeling.
01:41:35 This is cruel.
01:41:36 This is unusual.
01:41:37 OK.
01:41:38 I just thought that that was funny and a good way
01:41:41 to end the show before voicemails.
01:41:44 I'm so upset.
01:41:47 Peeled ponies.
01:41:49 Make your own peeled pony.
01:41:52 The first voicemail of the day is called A Bit of Trivia.
01:41:57 Also look up the TV chair.
01:41:59 And we'll post it right there.
01:42:00 There it is.
01:42:02 Are we ready?
01:42:02 Are we ready to go?
01:42:04 Oh, yeah.
01:42:05 OK, on the count of three, let's play it.
01:42:07 One, two, three, go.
01:42:09 Did you know the term information superhighway
01:42:11 possibly originates with the artist Namjoon Paik
01:42:14 with this term electronic superhighway
01:42:16 where he predicted the future of telecommunications
01:42:19 being all connected by electronic technology?
01:42:21 He's a good artist, too.
01:42:22 You should look up some of this stuff.
01:42:24 Specifically the TV Buddha.
01:42:26 That one's really cool.
01:42:28 Thank you.
01:42:29 Next.
01:42:30 OK.
01:42:30 I did not.
01:42:31 You've learned a lot.
01:42:32 I did not know that.
01:42:34 So that's pretty, pretty good.
01:42:39 I got my, that came out of my speakers for some reason.
01:42:43 I want everything to set default.
01:42:44 Yeah, I heard it.
01:42:45 You're going pretty bad.
01:42:47 You're sorry about that.
01:42:47 You annoyed me, Ben.
01:42:49 Again, like you always do.
01:42:52 Classic Ben.
01:42:54 Classic Ben.
01:42:54 All right.
01:42:56 Ben traumatizes me every day.
01:42:58 Oh.
01:43:00 The next one is going to be better.
01:43:02 The next one is called My Story,
01:43:04 which is a bit different from the normal stories.
01:43:08 Let me put it here in chat.
01:43:10 Do we wait for Gibb, who's peeing?
01:43:13 Should we wait for Gibb?
01:43:14 And just cut it out?
01:43:16 Why?
01:43:17 Why would we wait?
01:43:18 I don't know.
01:43:19 I don't know what's customary to you.
01:43:20 You usually wait for her.
01:43:23 Well, what are you going to fill the time?
01:43:25 Time waits for no one.
01:43:26 We can just post another peeled Pokemon.
01:43:28 No.
01:43:30 No more.
01:43:31 We can get a good one.
01:43:32 We have to unpeal.
01:43:34 OK, here's what we got to do.
01:43:35 I got to start an account that's called Unpeeled Pokemon.
01:43:38 You add things.
01:43:38 And it's just me redrawing the stuff that's
01:43:42 supposed to be there back on the peeled version.
01:43:45 That's honestly a great idea.
01:43:46 Just take their peel and then draw back
01:43:48 on what it's supposed to be.
01:43:50 But obviously, do it a little different.
01:43:53 Make it better.
01:43:54 I've got a good one to fill the time.
01:43:57 Just indulge in this for a moment.
01:43:59 Just indulge in him.
01:44:01 Just relax.
01:44:02 We listened to the second one.
01:44:03 No, we waited for you in post-it.
01:44:07 OK.
01:44:08 I'm glad you're back, so we don't
01:44:09 have to look at this anymore.
01:44:11 All right, the next one is called My Story, which
01:44:13 is a bit different from the normal stories.
01:44:15 Three, two, one, go.
01:44:19 My story is a bit different from the normal stories.
01:44:22 It started with me and my friends.
01:44:23 Our names was starting to get well known in the world we live in.
01:44:26 So that's when it started.
01:44:28 We had no idea what trolls were, so we didn't see it coming.
01:44:31 We was invited to a party, a troll party.
01:44:33 All of them up, it showed up.
01:44:35 And we had a pretty good time with our host.
01:44:37 They seemed pretty cool, but that was just to draw us in.
01:44:40 They asked us to come play some games with them.
01:44:42 At the time, it seemed cool, but that was just to get our trust.
01:44:46 So me and all the rest of them played their games
01:44:48 and had an awesome time.
01:44:50 But like I said, it was just to get our trust
01:44:52 so they could rip us down.
01:44:54 But none of us understood that, and they started to insult us.
01:44:57 But we had no idea how to react to it,
01:44:59 so they didn't get the negative response they was looking for.
01:45:02 What are they talking about?
01:45:03 We was just confused.
01:45:04 But some of the muppets found it interesting.
01:45:05 Muppets?
01:45:06 We went along with it, and that's when it started.
01:45:08 Is this Tales of the Trolling?
01:45:08 We decided to do it.
01:45:09 But we didn't understand what we were doing.
01:45:12 So we was liking it, but we didn't get a point of it.
01:45:14 This is a Tales of the Troll.
01:45:14 It was all fun and games, really.
01:45:16 Some of them took a liking to it.
01:45:17 All right, I've had enough.
01:45:18 Yes, Tales of the Troll is a funny comic
01:45:21 with funny, weird dialogue.
01:45:23 It's really amusing.
01:45:25 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
01:45:27 Thanks for wasting a minute of my life.
01:45:31 Next voicemail is called, I Know Nate Will Not Be Here
01:45:34 to Respond.
01:45:35 Thank God he isn't.
01:45:38 Three, two, one, go.
01:45:42 Nate, you coward.
01:45:43 The gamer zone is just the PCP.
01:45:46 Yeah.
01:45:47 It's just the same thing.
01:45:49 You're just doing the exact same thing.
01:45:51 Also, not even punctual.
01:45:53 All the topics you covered felt like they were like a month.
01:45:57 So if you're editing these things for like a month,
01:46:00 stop it.
01:46:01 Release them in a timely fashion.
01:46:03 You're talking about like JoJo Part 6 release.
01:46:07 That's old news.
01:46:08 Ancient news.
01:46:10 Feel with the times, buddy.
01:46:12 Thank you for your criticism.
01:46:15 It is just the PCP again, but with different people.
01:46:19 It's the alternative out of Touch Thursdays,
01:46:21 if you know what I mean.
01:46:23 Oh, I know what you mean.
01:46:25 I know what you mean.
01:46:25 Yeah, yeah.
01:46:28 Next one is called Josh Loading.
01:46:32 That's torture.
01:46:34 Josh Moon, Joshua Moon.
01:46:38 I don't know.
01:46:39 Three, two, one, what?
01:46:41 I know what I saw that name.
01:46:44 I know it's coming.
01:46:44 That's the that's null.
01:46:45 That's null.
01:46:47 I mean, I don't know if that's what this is about.
01:46:48 Whatever. Three, two, one, go.
01:47:00 OK.
01:47:00 Cool.
01:47:02 Get a drink of water, maybe.
01:47:04 Cheers.
01:47:07 You OK, buddy?
01:47:10 You good?
01:47:11 How you doing?
01:47:13 Are they like trying to wheeze with laughter at the bletter?
01:47:17 They're simply overcome by the world.
01:47:21 They are.
01:47:22 Next one is an image link.
01:47:24 I haven't seen it, but I'm going to post it here.
01:47:27 I don't know.
01:47:29 Oh.
01:47:30 Oh.
01:47:31 Oh.
01:47:34 How cute.
01:47:35 It's a pizza.
01:47:36 Pizza, pizza, pizza, he's like a Pokemon.
01:47:39 He's saying his name is Pizza P.
01:47:40 He's munchy.
01:47:41 Pizza P, it's munchy.
01:47:43 I'll show this to him when he wakes up.
01:47:46 He's back.
01:47:46 Is he still asleep?
01:47:47 What a bitch.
01:47:48 Dude, we all went to bed at 5 a.m.
01:47:51 Of course he's asleep.
01:47:53 I guess I got I got like four and a half hours of sleep.
01:47:56 Why would why would you be awake?
01:47:58 He is snoozing.
01:47:59 Here's another one.
01:48:00 Oh, I think I think this is just a dupe. Okay, they just they posted it. I think they sent the same one
01:48:05 It's actually really cute drawing. I like it a lot
01:48:08 It's cute. I mean it looks like a small child exactly. That's why I like it
01:48:13 I want to print it out and put it up in our office
01:48:16 Or in our bedroom or something do it do it dude. Okay, the next one is also an image. So here it goes
01:48:24 Well

01:51:34 Voice males on purpose. It's hilarious
01:51:38 Know what they say the more times you do the same thing
01:51:48 It's a great bitch. All right, I'm really annoying. That's the bit
01:51:59 It's just kind of shit
01:52:02 I was gonna ask who Tommy J is, but I think I've really gotten all the context
01:52:10 There was a whole saga there was a whole saga with I think I've heard vaguely about it. I don't yeah
01:52:18 Yeah, what it that was I mean
01:52:20 That was I'm enjoying. I'm enjoying the continual pink Floyd the wall
01:52:25 Very
01:52:27 All about Tommy J or just this one. I can't remember
01:52:31 Oh, no, no, that there was cringus bingus. There was it's just like a
01:52:35 Oh, yeah, PCP things. Yeah, I mean to ten ten thumbs up for that one
01:52:42 Well, we could we could
01:52:45 When that's done the PCP will have a better version of the wall
01:52:51 We should yeah, we should release we should release it on an album. We should release an album
01:52:56 We'll take everyone's fan fan voicemail songs
01:53:00 Steal them steal their value their surplus value
01:53:03 Make it into content. Why waste content? That's true. You gotta package it. Yeah, pack it. You're absolutely right, Ben
01:53:10 When you're right, I know you're right. I know I know it's true
01:53:14 Next next voicemail is called a death note spoiler warning. Oh shit three two one go
01:53:21 What's your opinion on the first half of death note i.e. before else death it's good
01:53:27 I like it. Yeah, it's good. It's like the first anime that I watched of course it was
01:53:33 But I've only seen like five anime so that's not saying much
01:53:38 The first half of death note. I mean, it's it's good and it's better than the second half
01:53:42 I don't remember the second half, but I know the first half they get handcuffed together and it's so
01:53:48 sexually tense
01:53:50 Yeah
01:53:52 It's it's it's it's the it really is a yeah we story
01:53:56 That nobody likes me said when I was nobody nobody wants to fuck Misa
01:54:01 Go away and let the boys have their fun, please
01:54:06 Yeah, I mean I guess the first part Misa is kind of annoying
01:54:10 She's not a very interesting character, but she gets a lot of screen time the whole like weird
01:54:14 I kind of like the weird convoluted scheme where like light makes himself lose his memory
01:54:19 But it's all in the he gets the note back in the end. It's like that's kind of clever
01:54:24 Yeah, it's it's it's like it takes a long time, but when it works out
01:54:28 It's like yeah, it's like the fucking Sherlock Holmes, but evil, but Japanese, but high school student. Hmm. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're in high school
01:54:37 Yeah, he's like they're like 30
01:54:42 Yeah, he he graduates high school and starts college and I think in the sea in the second season
01:54:48 He's like an adult like he works like it's ten years after L's death and yeah light has become like one of the police guys
01:54:56 Yeah, secretly still killing. You know, I haven't seen death in a long time
01:55:01 But I think my and all of our opinions are probably the same
01:55:06 Consensus is which is like first half is great and it's cool and interesting and the second half
01:55:13 I don't even remember what happens. I I remember near and the other guy
01:55:18 I remember them and I remember being less interested in it was definitely like a very
01:55:24 The story was like this rivalry between L
01:55:27 Yeah, that was what I'm getting rid of it
01:55:29 Like you deflate a lot of the like intrigue of the story
01:55:33 I mean, I mean sort of a punch it again because like the the of the new L near
01:55:41 Who has white hair and he plays with puzzle games and toys instead of like
01:55:47 Sweet treats or whatever. Yeah
01:55:50 he's
01:55:53 He somehow manages to outsmart him
01:55:57 Alongside his like accomplice the yellow haired something or other from bleach. Yeah
01:56:03 Mellow yeah kind of kind of the point kind of the point of mellow and near is that they aren't as good as as L
01:56:10 Yeah, they can't they can't measure up to him, but somehow together they managed to do it
01:56:14 I can't I can't remember how he gets outsmarted. I
01:56:18 Figure out whether that was smart or whether that was just like
01:56:21 Yeah, it's a good show. It's kind of long. I don't know if I would watch the entire show again
01:56:28 But the fucking the the highs are really high the good mom the
01:56:34 I guess the mangas not nearly as over at the top. It's very much just like presented in a
01:56:39 Straightforward manner, and I'm kind of curious to see how my opinion of the story would change if like the dramatics were toned down. I
01:56:47 Read the first volume of like the follow-up series about like the
01:56:52 It's it's basically death note, but it's like a thing that can make you fall in love. I think
01:56:59 breast
01:57:01 I
01:57:07 Didn't stick I didn't stick with it
01:57:10 You guys watch the you guys watch the movie right the the live-action movie with Nat Wolfe from naked brothers band
01:57:16 Of course, I I think I only watch the English one and I was like, oh, it's in live-action. No, I watched it
01:57:23 No, I didn't I didn't watch the American death
01:57:25 You know, I really like the ticotomy the the virgin Nat Wolfe playing
01:57:30 Playing light in the not good at all live-action death
01:57:34 Versus the Chad Alex Wolf playing Peter in hereditary and saying mommy and crying weird, which is cool and awesome
01:57:44 Haven't seen hereditary you're at Terry's cool. We should watch it
01:57:48 You'll be scared though. You you might cry then I
01:57:51 Yeah, I might I'm very pretty easily scared by films. I'm pretty easily unsettled
01:57:58 By images on the screen. It is
01:58:00 It is a tough watch, but it's great movie dear
01:58:05 Well tough watches are even tougher for me
01:58:09 Nick next voicemail is an image, so I'm just gonna post it right here. I don't know what it is
01:58:13 Let's see what we got. I think I forgot something if you forgot then it wasn't important
01:58:18 Yeah, you're right
01:58:21 Did I say that I
01:58:23 Don't remember. I'm just I say something alluded to the same effect. I probably say this all the time
01:58:30 This does seem like me. It brings true. I don't remember. Yeah, we probably said something like this on the last episode
01:58:37 I don't know. I don't know
01:58:41 Next voicemail
01:58:43 Next voicemail. Wait a minute before we move on
01:58:47 I feel like maybe I should say a lol Chris Pratt Mario
01:58:55 What's his name always
01:58:58 Charlie is Luigi
01:59:02 Jack black is Bowser is awesome something. I'm literally hyped now that Jack black is Bowser
01:59:07 Jack black is really important. It might be kind of good. I don't know. Jack black Bowser
01:59:14 Yes, I don't think I like I don't think I like Chris Pratt as Mario. I don't think I appreciate that
01:59:19 I think it is very no, I think it'll it'll be so strange
01:59:22 Cuz like well first of all, I don't know what Chris Pratt sounds like. I can't envision in my head. He just has a face
01:59:29 He sounds normal. So like a just some guy
01:59:34 With like what I presume is like a Mario that is reminiscent of the actual video games
01:59:39 You know short stuckey's cutesy with a just a normal guy's voice coming out of his mouth
01:59:44 It's gonna be so weird. I mean, do you think he's gonna do like a fake Italian accent?
01:59:52 If he does it'll be the
01:59:54 It'll be I'm very I think the universe will collapse in on it itself if he does like a Mario
01:59:59 I can't wait for this movie to come out and it's gonna be like Chris Pratt in the real world as a normal person just like a
02:00:05 a dumb but like like
02:00:08 Nice hearted father who doesn't understand that his wife son play so many video games
02:00:12 Until he gets he's a kite into his son's Nintendo and then he is no
02:00:17 Has to go through all these. Please. It's gonna be a great. Please. No
02:00:22 I should have just given Charles
02:00:25 Mamma Mia been fucking is a kind they don't even have to have Mario talk in complete
02:00:30 Sentences like they could literally have Charles Marnay. Just do it like Wally worked and the characters don't talk
02:00:36 Just do that. Just do Wally with Mario literally goes up and says yeah, Chris Pratt
02:00:41 He's so cool. Mario's gonna be talking a lot in this movie. So we had to make sure the casting was right or some shit
02:00:47 I'm just like he's Charles Marnay. The funny it is mentioning that Mario's going to talk a lot
02:00:53 Like what do they mean? That sounds like it's like you normally doesn't talk
02:00:56 I guess is well, he doesn't normally talk, but like it feels like a strange thing to highlight
02:01:01 What we've got an actor and they're gonna work part of what announce all this like star-studded cast and they're like
02:01:06 Oh, Charles Marnay is gonna be in the movie doing cameos like imagine voicing Mario for 30 years
02:01:11 And then having to walk in the booth to do cameos for the Super Mario movie like I know I feel bad
02:01:17 It's like like hire real fucking voice actors, please
02:01:21 Like except Jack Black is a good voice actor like he's done other roles that are good like if you said hey
02:01:28 Do a voice acting role for Mario in a theatrical film like he could do it like he's a voice actor. That's his job
02:01:35 Yeah, he should yeah
02:01:38 Illumination slash
02:01:42 Chris Pratt, oh, yeah, okay
02:01:44 I was basically I I mean no my point is why is Chris Pratt Mario Charles Marnay should be Mario? Everyone thinks this
02:01:52 I think it's Jack Black is
02:01:55 You know, I gotta assume that they wanted Mario to sound more like normal and you know
02:02:01 Martin a gives him like that very like silly like like
02:02:03 Wahoo, yes
02:02:12 Bowser and the fucking castle's collapsing Luigi we gotta get out of here
02:02:18 I think I see me sounds like yeah, just imagine like Star Lord, but
02:02:23 Mario, I mean Star Wars already red. So if you squint you can kind of already imagine it
02:02:27 Just watch Guardians of Galaxy and squint the whole time interested to see what they do
02:02:32 But because I'm sure it's gonna be strange, but I just don't feel like Mario is a franchise that you can make a movie out of
02:02:39 I feel like this. Yeah solidified my opinion that like Shigeru Miyamoto is a hack now
02:02:45 Like he's washed up. Do you think it's gonna be like f zero?
02:02:48 I'm not like Mario and Star Fox was already bad enough, but this this solidified me Miyamoto's a hack there. I said it
02:02:56 Well, they said it was gonna be animated by Illumination Studios, which is like the the Minions movie
02:03:01 Yeah, I'm so excited to see what they do with Goombas. I'm sure it's gonna be great. I assume it's not
02:03:08 It's not gonna be like Half-Life action, but they didn't actually specify anything. They're gonna. I mean like they're gonna make all of the like
02:03:16 Lovable little enemy characters like insufferable like I I'm really not looking forward to watching this movie in theaters
02:03:23 Which I will do by the way
02:03:25 I'm not looking forward to but I'm definitely going to be
02:03:31 It's it's a nice day midnight showing
02:03:34 Yeah, I'm just seeing like characters that I love like little like shy guys on screen and being like I love shy guy
02:03:40 And then going to see Illumination making them be like horrible to listen to you
02:03:45 You have to buy your ticket to see this movie because it will be all that they're talking about around the water cooler on Monday
02:03:52 And if you're not in the conversation, then you might as well be fuck be a left
02:03:59 I don't care about Sonic therefore. I didn't watch the Sonic movie. I I love Mario. I'm gonna watch the Mario movie
02:04:06 I'm just gonna do it. I
02:04:08 Think you're I'm curious the idea of like being in a cinema and and and seeing
02:04:15 You know before you actually watch the movie for the first time it's the first time you're seeing the movie
02:04:19 You know that there's all these famous people playing these Mario characters
02:04:23 You're like what the fuck are they gonna do with this and whatever it is to be bombarded with it on a giant screen
02:04:29 I feel like you would make you laugh so hard. You would die exactly
02:04:33 That's why I want to go to the theater because I think it's gonna be so
02:04:37 Stupid I'm gonna laugh and I'm gonna be entertained genuinely
02:04:42 Perhaps
02:04:44 Maybe the movie will be great and will move me to tears
02:04:48 Anything just like just like my little pony the next generation
02:04:56 Let's
02:04:57 Go to the next voicemail, which is called. I hope you're ready for this. The next one is called fapping on Mike

02:14:04 No, I don't
02:14:06 I
02:14:09 Want to say it's just true
02:14:11 I want to ask who made the thumbnail for the last time I was on where it's like my head on one side of the screen Joe
02:14:17 Biden's head on the other side. I think it was Eleazar Eleazar makes the thumb
02:14:21 Eleazar that was hilarious. Please do that again, but with sunny
02:14:30 Or with me and Josh scorcher
02:14:32 No, no, no do it like a screenshot from the movie where it's the wanted poster, but it's sunny and Cassie. I
02:14:38 Want crack to be there too though crack
02:14:40 crack needs to be in the
02:14:44 Absolutely, just just peeking out just peeking out the corner. Be creative do something hilarious. I'm counting on you
02:14:51 Wait, no, it's the last 10 year on I'm trying to find Joe Biden was elected. That's why it was like right after the
02:14:57 So it would have been no member
02:14:59 or
02:15:00 So wow almost a year ago. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see it. That was about 10 months ago. How was it feels like only yesterday?
02:15:11 Okay, well next voicemail is called whatev three two one go
02:15:20 Hey PCP at my local grocery store one of the baggers like he doesn't say hello. He just starts quoting I
02:15:28 believe either
02:15:30 spongebob or
02:15:33 That one Batman series that was really popular and like maybe the late 90s or early
02:15:40 2000s the animated one and
02:15:43 But he doesn't like say hello. It's just like you pull up to the register
02:15:48 And then he just immediately starts going into like quoting these and like I I just usually ignore him
02:15:54 But I don't know I feel like I'm starting to get kind of like a guilty conscious about it like
02:15:59 Should I say hi? Should I interact? It's like he's not interacting in a way
02:16:05 SpongeBob memes
02:16:06 Autism or something it's hard to tell I don't know you should you should memorize the both series
02:16:11 And so like you know like when he says a quote you should know like what the next line is and you should say it back
02:16:16 I think that would make his day. That's the lowest man
02:16:19 Just say some spongebob meme or just refer to like the episode with the gray ghost from Batman
02:16:23 Like you should just laugh. I'm gonna say the same thing. Just just fucking do a spongebob laugh impression at him
02:16:31 Really got to test the waters
02:16:34 I don't learn the language kind of leaning
02:16:37 I'm kind of leaning towards the do not interact like just just just just just avoid just avoid
02:16:42 I mean why you open a can of worms?
02:16:45 avoid
02:16:49 Yeah, honestly, yeah, that's my advice of no Ben's mean and wrong
02:16:54 I'm
02:16:56 Just Ben Ben Ben. Hey Ben Ben speaking for Ben. Hey, it's a central interacted with a lot and
02:17:04 Don't make that one person that Kona grill. He screamed at them and they cried
02:17:10 Screamed I was a bit annoyed. I was a bit annoyed because he double-charged me for my meal
02:17:18 And I think that you assumed malice though. That's unassumed malice
02:17:23 Well, you got to be firm you got to be firm and you responded in kind with malice. Yeah. Yes, absolutely
02:17:30 That's the only thing they respond to it's the only thing they understand
02:17:34 They talk about the working class is a lower a lower
02:17:38 You know those people that's kind of people. Let me go sharpen my guillotine
02:17:44 Hmm
