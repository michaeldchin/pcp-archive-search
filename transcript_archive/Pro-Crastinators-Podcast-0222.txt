00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Here we are
00:00:09 in the desert drought land of the dark YouTube arc. And I'm here by my lonesome. Let me tell
00:00:16 you a story. Let me tell you a little story, okay? So I woke up today, wasn't feeling very good.
00:00:24 I like hurt my back again. I had like a second spot where I thought I might have hurt my back
00:00:30 yesterday. So I rolled out of bed. I use the term roll loosely because I can't really move that much
00:00:37 at all. But I rolled out of bed, came downstairs, started a 3D print. Have I mentioned on The Pro
00:00:42 Crastinators Podcast I got a 3D printer? I think so. I started a 3D print, been dialing in some
00:00:48 settings, making some cool shit, which you'll see in the few months I suppose maybe. And that was,
00:00:54 I went out, I got some some snacks, came back, checked on the print, it was doing okay. And I
00:00:59 rolled into discord and it's like, huh, wonder how many people showed up for the PCP today?
00:01:03 I'm like a half an hour late. Let's see. Zero. It hadn't started. Nobody even remembered to
00:01:08 fucking start it. So I messaged everybody and I was like, Hey, what's going on the PCP? And I had
00:01:14 to check the calendar. I'm like, it's Sunday, right? This is recording day. Hmm, strange.
00:01:20 I guess Ben is hungover, like ridiculously, according to Gib. So that's probably why he
00:01:26 didn't add everybody as he is one to do. And so here we are recording a little bit later than
00:01:33 usual. It's just me. I don't know what I'm going to say because I didn't plan on being on the episode
00:01:39 today, but the show must go on quite literally because this is a show. So Gib might be dropping
00:01:44 in at some point because I added everybody and he was the only one who responded. But we're just
00:01:49 going to do a chill episode today about something haven't figured it out yet. We'll get there though.
00:01:56 We'll get there, my friends. This is going to be a super chill laid back one man episode of the
00:02:01 procrastinators podcast. I guess we'll just start at the 3d printing stuff. 3d printing is pretty
00:02:09 fucking cool. It's been my new obsession. I talked about this on my Patreon bonus podcast,
00:02:14 but I've been taking a two week hiatus from the internet. I just got off of Twitter for the most
00:02:19 part, haven't really been going on YouTube, didn't go on any social media stuff and I haven't been
00:02:24 thinking about my work and my content in terms of like trying to make it good for social media
00:02:30 engagements. I have instead retreated and I'm trying to cleanse my brain of all that outside
00:02:36 influence of trying to like stress about fitting your creativity peg into the square hole of like
00:02:43 making things to satisfy the algorithms instead. I'm just like, I'm just going to do what I want.
00:02:47 And it opened up so many new possibilities. My brain's going in a million different directions.
00:02:52 You know, 3d printing is fucking based and cool and sick. I've been doing all these really cool
00:02:56 things. I've been making 3d models and blender and I'm scaling them down to little miniature
00:02:59 size and printing them out and dialing in the settings of the 3d printer trying to figure out
00:03:04 how to make it work to anybody who doesn't know how what a 3d printer is and how it works.
00:03:08 There are two kinds of 3d printers. There is an FDM style printer, which is the most common one.
00:03:14 And that's where you have like a nozzle that melts plastic to like a couple like a like 200 degrees
00:03:20 centigrade and then layer by layer. It goes up the entire model and recreates it in a physical
00:03:26 space. And that's the kind of printer I have right now. I have the anycubic i3 mega s. Maybe
00:03:31 I'll put a link to a picture of it in the show notes. If I'm smart, I will have done that.
00:03:37 So this is the printer I've been messing around with right now. And it's just really
00:03:42 interesting technology and how it works. It's printing at like one tenth of a millimeter
00:03:46 layer heights and it stacks up a bunch of them and makes figures. And I've been experimenting with
00:03:51 that seeing how that works. There's also another kind of printer called SLA or resin style printer.
00:03:58 And that's it uses like a vat of resin and then uses UV light to harden it like one layer at a
00:04:03 time. And those print even thinner and they make even better style of models. And those are good
00:04:06 for miniatures. But resin is like toxic and you breathe it and it'll fucking kill you. So you
00:04:11 have to wear like a respirator and wear gloves and shit. So that's on the list because that'll make
00:04:17 miniatures even cooler because that's pretty much exactly my use case. It's they make all their money
00:04:22 by selling to nerds who play D&D and want to print their own miniatures. But I'm gonna make my own
00:04:26 custom miniatures. So someday when I'm not gay, I'll have that. I think someone joined the call.
00:04:32 Who's here? Who joined? Hello. It's Gib. What's up, dude? Nothing much. I'm just on the procrastinators
00:04:41 podcast suddenly. Yeah, we procrastinated pretty hard starting this week's episode.
00:04:47 Yeah. I mean, a lot of the time it's been who's like, Hey guys, just just you know, I'm the only
00:04:54 one paying attention. I will announce that it's time to do PCP. But I think Ben is
00:05:01 indisposed in some fashion, you know, maybe a little bit of a alcohol related absence.
00:05:09 Hilarious. What what a what a what a good boy he is with his alcohol.
00:05:16 Yeah, I was just kind of killing time just talking about what I've been personally doing. I was
00:05:19 talking about how I took a two week break from social media and it's like reinvigorated my
00:05:23 brain and then you realize that making things just because like you want to is fucking cool.
00:05:32 Because like I was talking about this on my bonus podcast that like
00:05:37 my entire adult life has been spent trying to make a career on the internet like since I was 16
00:05:41 to right now. So like 16 years. And by just taking a break and just like purposely saying just do
00:05:47 whatever you want to do and like stop worrying about like how is it going to be marketable or
00:05:50 how's it going to work on social media like my brain just exploded. And I started thinking about
00:05:54 like learning how to do soldering and like buying like a raspberry pi and like soldering enough and
00:06:00 3d printing like cases around them so you can like make custom little micro consoles and stuff and
00:06:04 like soldering together like controllers so you can make little bar top arcade cabinets out of them
00:06:09 and like just all these crazy ideas that don't make any sense to like the kind of identity and
00:06:14 sort of things that I've been doing online because they're not really that marketable in terms of
00:06:20 being able to produce something like that at scale or things like that but they're fucking cool
00:06:25 and I'm just thinking about doing cool things and it's pretty liberating because like the first
00:06:29 time I've ever really done that in a million billion years. Yeah I really like all of that
00:06:37 the sort of inventiveness you have when you just like the idea of building a tiny little
00:06:41 console is like really cool I would never think to do anything like that. Right it's very interesting
00:06:47 just because like a lot of the times I'll try and I want to learn something new right because even
00:06:53 the stuff I'm doing right now like learning 3d and like trying to get better at it I always feel
00:06:57 the pressure of I don't have time to get better I need to make things I need to output things and
00:07:04 when you stop having to worry about social media it's like I have all the time in the world I can
00:07:07 do whatever the fuck I want I don't have to output shit I can just learn the thing I can learn things
00:07:12 that don't even matter I just do whatever the fuck I want it's cool it's fucking cool. Yeah I've
00:07:18 been feeling well the opposite of that that that urge to like constantly be producing
00:07:26 ever since ever since I announced I would do the Tezuka manga project I've been thinking
00:07:32 gotta stay on track gotta be focused gotta be working on that uh deadline deadline oh shit
00:07:38 the world is gonna end when I get one tweet who says uh you didn't finish that and that'll be me
00:07:44 like time to get the rope guys it's time to find a tree somewhere end it all no because
00:07:50 there's one tweet who said I didn't do it you gotta make a tire swing that's what you're doing right
00:07:53 that's what you're talking about making a tire swing just hanging out yes that's what I'm thinking of
00:07:57 and it's so I'm like you know I've realized in the past few weeks that I'm stupidly stressing
00:08:05 myself out over something that if I hadn't announced it I wouldn't even be worried in any way I would
00:08:12 just be working I mean I would still be worried by the fact that like you're surrounded by people who
00:08:18 are like collectively outputting content all the time even though individually they are taking
00:08:24 a while each to get their thing out but like there's always something new to watch as a viewer
00:08:29 something new to see something new to read and then you're there thinking I've got to keep up with
00:08:35 like the collective efforts of every creator on the internet and it's like it's stupid so I'm like
00:08:42 super stupid but I feel that all the time I feel like like when you when you and uh when you and
00:08:48 Ben I'll put comics I'm like oh I want to make a comic why haven't I done it why am I not doing it and
00:08:52 it's just like dumb dumb can't you comparing yourself even though that's like my modus operandi
00:09:00 like uh Ben's been working on the uh Sleiman punishment finale and he says it's very close
00:09:05 to being finished and I know when it's posted I'm gonna be like oh that's good like I get the
00:09:11 feeling it's gonna be incredible and everyone's gonna be like holy shit Ben whoa and I'm gonna be
00:09:15 like yeah yeah holy shit Ben you mother fuck yeah exactly it's like when new lord of ghost comes out
00:09:23 I'm like oh you're fucking god damn like you were doing those like once a week and I was like
00:09:26 yeah it's unbelievable turned into a magikar disgusting kill him kill him and seep his power
00:09:33 a vampiric ability soul drain that's what I need yeah it was I mean it was deceptively quick
00:09:42 what I was putting out I mean I was drawing the panels uh pretty fast uh but the first few weeks
00:09:48 I was like hurting my hand I had to slow down a bit but um the preparation for that had been going
00:09:54 on for months before like planning it out and and drawing all this the sketches and figuring out
00:10:00 panel lay on stuff so like actually doing the the the work of inking it was the only thing I was
00:10:06 actually doing and it made it seem like I was like a god suddenly and I felt like a god and so as
00:10:13 soon as I was like all right it's time to work on a new project because there's a special contest
00:10:17 that I want to enter um I had sort of forgotten maybe that the lord of ghost took months of prep
00:10:24 work and now I was expecting myself to do the entire thing in three months and it took two
00:10:30 months to get the story and I have one month left to draw the entire thing from scratch
00:10:36 and it's very daunting but I I have an announcement to make regarding that um
00:10:42 um for just you know just to make it a fun little thing um and so that I'm not like
00:10:48 suffering in silence in the darkness I'm going to be live streaming my attempt at drawing the
00:10:54 whole thing in a month over on my twitch uh in august I'm going to be doing like like a full
00:11:02 work day maybe a little less I can't remember the hours I was thinking of doing but I'm going to be
00:11:08 waking up eating breakfast and then streaming until like 7 30 pm me drawing the thing
00:11:16 and that that's going to be like every weekday of august I'm going to try and do that
00:11:20 and you're going to do like a regular stream or you're going to do like a silent stream where
00:11:23 you're just working and people can watch but you're not talking to chat or anything or you're
00:11:27 going to do full distraction stream where you're going to be trying to be entertaining on top of
00:11:30 being productive you know I I probably will try to be I'm going to have my mic on because
00:11:38 I do like interacting with the chat a little bit um if only if only to if only to like I don't know
00:11:46 express my frustration with whatever I'm doing like oh no and then people in chat can be like
00:11:50 don't worry and then I'll be like okay so yeah you actually react like that I can only hope that you
00:11:58 do ah gee you know I don't know I in my head I'm like there's no way I can actually do it uh that
00:12:06 quickly but at least I could make a bunch of content about it at least maybe you know people
00:12:14 will be interested in seeing the process maybe I could save the video and then you know when I'm a
00:12:19 super famous man and I have like a blu-ray of my new anime that I made this can be like footage
00:12:27 like commentary track I can commentate over my drawing of the original comic that started it all
00:12:32 or something stupid like that so it's it's that's that's august is going to be that for me
00:12:40 so it's like is this is this tesga comic is this like the start of a new comic that regardless of
00:12:46 how it performs in the tesga contest you're going to keep working with the characters and stuff or
00:12:50 is this kind of just a one-off thing um it it started off it was one of the characters I had
00:12:55 plans for a comic anyway so I was thinking you know if I want to make a comic about this character
00:13:02 now is a very good time to start because it's it's uh you know you gotta make a comic and submit it
00:13:07 so yes I'm gonna uh regardless of whether I finish it or not I'm going to continue to work on it
00:13:14 until it is finished and then make another chapter later and it's hopefully gonna be really cool
00:13:21 and I'm just I'm just I'm just it's like this is all happening from my perspective tomorrow I'm
00:13:26 starting tomorrow so right now I'm just doing nothing I'm just chilling out relaxing
00:13:32 doing stupid nothing stuff so that the color before the storm come before the storm so I know
00:13:38 that I enjoyed myself before I put myself through what could be hell I don't really know yet so by
00:13:45 the time this comes out you'll be on day five I will be yes on day five go to twitch.tv slash
00:13:51 give and take to to watch along uh so are you gonna start what time are you starting uh like

00:14:28 bored I will watch give and take that that that's that's the time so when this episode comes out
00:14:35 you'll be just about starting to wrap up on Friday yeah interesting go catch the last
00:14:43 25 or so minutes of of the struggle that Gibba takes undertaking undertaking
00:14:52 ooh now now I'm now I'm really invested now I'm ready to go if sans is going to be there
00:14:57 I'm I'm I'm I'm game I'm locked in uh yeah it's not sans it's my new original character times new
00:15:03 roman oh shit it's aerial the the new waifu version of sans she's got she's got like spine
00:15:16 bone hair you know like like hairs that look like little miniature spines coming down
00:15:23 it's pretty dope that's that's an original character do not steal right there yep put
00:15:27 put that in lord of ghosts you know I easily could lord of ghosts is just full of like cool
00:15:31 character designs in the background is lord of ghosts is done are you still gonna keep working
00:15:35 on them I cut it off at a point where it could be done if I wanted it to be but I do want to finish
00:15:42 like lord of ghosts coming back with his army of the dead and being like I'll take over the endless
00:15:49 war and kill it forever so there's some sort of plan but I don't I haven't actually written it yet
00:15:58 that would be cool be sick oh god I almost I have this giant can of golden bear light
00:16:05 lemonade and I almost knocked it off the table onto my computer that would have been bad I'm
00:16:09 gonna move that away from there oh dear um shit I'm so unprepared in terms of things I wanted to
00:16:18 talk about because I was not planning on being on today I was just gonna I was gonna let Ben
00:16:24 take the reins as he is one to do but holy shit we gotta we gotta come up with something we gotta
00:16:30 we gotta pull something ever it's only been 17 minutes 17 minutes is not long enough for a
00:16:35 procrastinator's podcast episode well I uh I can I can pad this out for a little bit
00:16:44 all right you have 45 minutes to go okay let me go very slow um recently uh geowizard
00:16:53 youtuber and cool bloke um the guy who did the mission across wiles I don't know if you if you
00:17:01 watch that uh was the um the the mission to walk across the country of wiles in a completely
00:17:08 straight line using a gps tracker and uh I talked about him on the podcast before and he has since
00:17:16 then done a couple another a couple missions similar to that but not exactly the same but
00:17:23 recently he did uh an attempt a second attempt at this this challenge and it was a it was really
00:17:31 good I really love his his videos it's it's just something like tv quality about the the production
00:17:39 not in not in a sense of like high fidelity um footage but sort of it's a really really
00:17:46 interesting concept with you know well structured storytelling beats and editing that just sort
00:17:52 of make it flow really nicely and he's very funny and it's really just very interesting
00:17:58 and that sort of stuff just really gets me going really gets me inspired I know how you
00:18:04 earlier you were saying like when you're not thinking about like being a content machine and
00:18:08 doing stuff for social media and you just let yourself do stuff even if it's not going to be
00:18:14 profitable necessarily it's just like what do you want to do I want to do that I have no like
00:18:20 real outdoorsy experience I've gone on a couple walks and a hike maybe I've camped a couple times
00:18:27 but that sort of thing is like it's just so cool like I I went on after watching uh the
00:18:35 latest episode and I was just like looking at google earth google maps and just scrolling around like
00:18:41 what part of england could I just walk across could I just walk all the way to the fucking sea
00:18:46 from my house how long would that take would I need to pack lunch probably it's like ah the world is
00:18:53 so big and there's so much cool shit even in even in the tiniest of of country is the tiniest of
00:18:59 islands there's just so much to see human beings are so infinitesimally small in the grand scale of
00:19:05 even the smallest part of the earth it's just so so big guys I love geology I love geography I love
00:19:14 all of that and I'm like yeah I want to do it but then I keep thinking oh yeah COVID
00:19:24 time to just crumple into a into a I don't know this is like the perfect time to do it
00:19:30 though because then you can just do it nobody will bother you you know you can just go like like
00:19:34 no one's gonna like chase you out of a place you're not supposed to be because they're all
00:19:37 locked inside you can just like this is the perfect time to like life hack and take like
00:19:41 weird areas and go to places you shouldn't go because there'll be less people around to keep
00:19:46 you out of that I suppose that's true yeah I'm thinking of like I don't know getting a backpack
00:19:52 together I mean it's August so it would be a very like if it was a hot day it would be a devastating
00:19:58 sort of time to do this because you'd need a lot more water with you and I don't really know how
00:20:05 to live off the land or start a campfire on my own I mean you need a lighter and wood
00:20:11 so that's not too difficult it's gotta gotta learn just gotta teach yourself all I gotta learn I gotta
00:20:16 do I gotta go I think first step is like learning from like going on a hiking club like a finding
00:20:25 a hiking group to go hiking with and seeing seeing how fun that is just you know doing doing it the
00:20:32 baby way before I like try to tackle the wilderness with nothing but my wits because I don't have any
00:20:39 I'm looking at the the wits tank and it's empty sure I mean I think that's a good
00:20:47 good mentality for learning any new skill is always start with like the least possible
00:20:52 resistance and then build yourself up because like so many times I'm going a little bit more
00:20:58 macro with this but I think it applies to really any new skill or any new hobby anybody gets into
00:21:03 you'll be a new person doesn't know anything about x subject and you'll go look online or
00:21:09 like go join a group or ask people or like research things out like how do I get started in this
00:21:15 and then they'll recommend something like two steps above like the very basic thing because
00:21:18 like it's the best thing to do it'll last you the longest it's the best value or whatever it's like
00:21:22 the best thing to do and then you'll do that but you risk like losing incentive because
00:21:32 it's a little bit above your pay grade because you're talking to enthusiasts you're talking to
00:21:36 people who have more knowledge so they can look at something that's a little bit more complicated
00:21:41 than a beginner level and be like this is a way better thing to get or way better place to start
00:21:45 or way better thing to like wet your teeth on but you'll like pull that back and be like I'm super
00:21:52 baby mode I probably shouldn't do that and then those same enthusiasts will kind of like give you
00:21:56 for it because I'm just thinking in terms of like when I started doing game dev like everyone said
00:22:04 you know like use Godot or use Unity or whatever and I use construct 3 instead and it's like not
00:22:08 real programming and they're like why are you using that it's like shitty and it's like not as good
00:22:13 as these things it's like yeah but I don't know what the fuck I'm doing I've told myself for 15
00:22:17 years I can't do this so like I need those little like small baby step wins to give me the the
00:22:24 confidence to keep going because if you just dive into the deep end or just like you know
00:22:29 like an enthusiast grade thing or you know put it bring it back to your example if like you just
00:22:33 went out in the wilderness like with a couple youtube videos under your belt telling you like
00:22:37 your best practices that's way different than like starting something really really simple just
00:22:41 kind of like ease yourself into it it was the same thing with 3d printing like there was like a
00:22:46 really like you know get a ender three kit and put it together and like then spend another
00:22:52 hundred dollars in upgrades and like pull it apart and put it back together and I got like
00:22:56 i3 mega which was already preassembled and had all those upgrades pretty much already installed
00:23:01 and it's like yeah I don't understand how the whole thing works like you would putting a kit
00:23:05 together but like I'm printing and making things and that's getting me much more invested in like
00:23:10 continuing the hobby as opposed to failing at putting this together or like getting frustrated
00:23:15 trying to figure out what all the upgrades meant and what they did and just getting pissed off so
00:23:20 like I don't know for anything you get into always like go at like the super beginner level if you
00:23:26 don't have any confidence with it even if that's not like the best way or the correct way to do
00:23:32 things that like people more into it would tell you to do yeah that such a thing that I've encountered
00:23:39 a lot is just the frustration of of people who are who are already know knowledgeable about a
00:23:46 certain subject or I mean specifically in art there are certain people who you know they drew
00:23:52 when they were very young and so they naturally gain some skills that they sort of take for granted
00:23:59 some sort of observational skills some understanding fundamental understanding that they don't even
00:24:04 know they have above like somebody who starts drawing at 23 or something um and when they
00:24:11 try to give advice they're taking advantage of not taking vultures that they're taking for granted
00:24:19 all of this stuff that they they sort of inherently understand and they assume other people inherently
00:24:24 understand it as well and they sort of just they don't know how to give the advice well
00:24:30 and then the person who is like not as not as like naturally into it or hadn't started at a young
00:24:36 enough age just doesn't understand these things that they're saying and doesn't know why it doesn't
00:24:41 working that's why that's why a really good teacher is important it's it's very difficult to get a
00:24:48 thorough proper understanding of anything from just youtube videos you need someone who knows
00:24:53 how to do the the entire teaching method stuff yeah I was about to say the exact same thing that
00:25:00 like this really like hammers home why a good teacher is so important because a great teacher
00:25:06 will be able to explain what they'll have the skills to do it at a high level
00:25:11 but the ability to describe it at a complete beginner level to like de-abstract a lot of the
00:25:16 kind of like essential building blocks that you don't think about as somebody new to it
00:25:23 but be able to then build upon those and give you that complex understanding over time
00:25:29 and there are some people on youtube and just teachers in general who are really good at that
00:25:34 and some that aren't and I think it's really easy to get into something and get a bad teacher
00:25:41 and assume you're too dumb for it where it's that the information wasn't given to you in a way
00:25:46 that works because not only do you need someone who can explain in a simple way
00:25:50 everybody also has like specific ways of learning things um because there's like programming and
00:25:57 stuff there are certain programming courses and books and videos that'll explain a subject that I
00:26:03 don't understand but then another person can explain that same thing and then it makes sense so
00:26:09 it's really weird like learning a new skill is very very finicky and you have to like be
00:26:14 patient with yourself to find the right teacher and find your learning style and find someone
00:26:19 where those two kind of paths collide and you can actually absorb the knowledge yeah you gotta
00:26:25 you gotta spread yourself out try try what is the word something the market you gotta you gotta
00:26:32 test the waters with all different like a variety of people because um in like if you if you went
00:26:38 to a class uh the teacher if you don't get what they're saying you can put your hand up and say
00:26:45 what ha like they can understand that you need help in this specific explanation but in a youtube
00:26:53 video you can't really do that you can like ask comments but like a lot of the time you find a
00:26:59 youtube tutorial and it's very old or like they just don't check the comments after a certain point
00:27:06 and it sort of feels like you can't really get into contact with the people because usually the
00:27:09 best most popular channels they obviously get thousands of comments all the time it's like
00:27:15 you're gonna get it's like having one teacher with a thousand students in the class you're
00:27:19 never gonna get his attention so if you don't understand what he's saying you're fucked
00:27:24 exactly so i don't know like i mean when you when you get to that point a lot of time you'll just
00:27:31 be like instead of raising your hand being like huh what you just have to like keep pressing back
00:27:36 like five seconds watch the same thing and just saying huh what getting more and more angry each
00:27:41 time until you feel like an idiot yeah i tried i tried a bit of programming but it was too i i
00:27:49 tried to like make this is the thing that frustrated me the most out of anything in my life
00:27:54 when i was trying to make my website which at the time was called aps adventures and uh
00:28:00 is now gib and take dot site where i just host my comics and i know what i wanted it to look like
00:28:07 i know what i wanted it to be functionally useful for and i didn't really care about it
00:28:12 being extremely technically marvelous i just wanted it to work but there's so much to learn
00:28:20 about the very basics of html and and coding a website that it was like so daunting all i wanted
00:28:27 to do is just say i just want a website how do i just get one how do i just have one right do i go
00:28:33 to uh what's that thing the thing that has been in every video um this video by square space um
00:28:42 like that i was looking at i was like hmm i get the feeling this is too expensive i don't really
00:28:50 you know i guess i'm being a cheapskate in that like i needed an easier way i needed an easier
00:28:56 way and i was like i'd rather learn it myself but it was so painful to learn i just sort of didn't
00:29:02 have the right mind for it like a lot of the things that they were saying would just not go into
00:29:07 my head right and it was very difficult to try and find a very baby explanation like a of these
00:29:14 concepts and i still to this day don't really know how my site works and if i ever need to edit
00:29:19 anything it's it's very scary and i i often i think on many occasions i've gone to discord and twitter
00:29:26 and just like cried like star web design sucks just like crying into the void like nobody understands
00:29:35 you know slip my wrists but with um with a you know hgtb slash colon slash slash my wrist that's
00:29:45 what i was going for yeah well i think it's one of the things that i do a lot which kind of falls
00:29:53 into the same sort of category is like you'll go right online uh and be like okay i want to make
00:29:59 a website and then everyone will be like oh just learn html just learn html and css bro like just
00:30:05 do it and then javascript just learn javascript too and it's just like you have to ask yourself
00:30:12 what do i actually need to know right because like if you're trying to become a web designer
00:30:19 yeah learn html learn css learn javascript learn all that shit like there's so many different
00:30:25 fucking like tech stacks for web design now it's insane i know because my sister is like a professional
00:30:30 like web and ux designer and she's like yeah i do like seven jobs now it's ridiculous so like
00:30:35 that's a whole nightmare in and of itself but like if you're just making give and take that site
00:30:40 do you need to learn html like that seems like almost like a waste of time right when there are
00:30:44 so many tools to just do it for you it's like why do i not just use something that does it for me
00:30:50 i don't you have no interest in web design outside of hosting the content you care about in a public
00:30:57 space and my personal thing is like so many times like when i want to get into something i want to
00:31:03 like learn it all so it's like i want to learn all of html just to make a website for a zoomie
00:31:08 someday it's like but why why would i do that you know i did that for sources loss i spent like
00:31:13 months building an entire website from scratch and it's like cool but what was the point like i
00:31:19 didn't need to do that i could have just gone and done what you did and just like use a website
00:31:23 builder or something and it would have been just as fine so it's just like i don't know there was
00:31:28 this interesting thing that um uh uh uh six tin uh uh showed me uh because we talk in uh a discord
00:31:36 group and stuff and it was like the valve t-pose skill set mentality thing i forget exactly what
00:31:43 it was called but um i guess it was like a graphic from valve and it was like you have like a character
00:31:51 standing in a t-pose and the idea was like the spine is like your central skill and the spine
00:31:56 supports that skill and that's like your specialty that's like your one skill you're really good with
00:32:00 and then the arms support skills that you're familiar with but don't have a lot of knowledge in
00:32:05 and i thought that was a really smart way of thinking about like laying out your skill set
00:32:09 right it's like you have one thing you focus on like this is my identity this is what i am if
00:32:13 i was going to have a job title this would be it the like supporting like structural center skill
00:32:20 then i have other things branching off of that that aren't nearly as strong that i should have other
00:32:24 people help or do for me or outsource in some fashion but i have a working knowledge of and can
00:32:30 support the main skill and i thought that was a really good way of kind of reeling in at least
00:32:38 my personal kind of like desire of wanting to be like a one-man band and just be the autodidact
00:32:43 who absorbs everything and learns all the things and becomes a master of everything which is literally
00:32:48 impossible in one human lifetime um it was fucking cool and i like that idea yeah god i i've always
00:32:58 been like skill hopping i never stick with any one thing for too long i've i've become
00:33:05 what's the term jack of all trades yeah so like it's always been a thing i do to like
00:33:13 get somewhat proficient in a skill but then find that i would rather also have other skills on top
00:33:19 of that and i never stick with anyone long enough to like become a master at it so i'm like pretty
00:33:26 good at a lot of things i'm knowledgeable about programming like i watch my brother do it and
00:33:30 he is like very very good at it so but i can i can i have enough knowledge to comprehend what he's
00:33:36 doing and maybe suggest things that don't like aren't stupid but a lot of the you know i would
00:33:44 never be able to do anything on the level of what he does uh programming wise and it just sort of
00:33:52 it frustrates me that i do this like i'm i'm pretty i'm pretty adept at the drawing stuff
00:33:58 i'm pretty good at animation i've dabbled in music when am i gonna be like really good at
00:34:04 anything though that's what i want to know yeah i feel the same way i skill hop all the time and
00:34:09 it's like it's not even it's subconscious because like i got the 3d printer to be like i'm just
00:34:14 gonna try 3d printing some of my models and then i got like really into that and just like like
00:34:19 researching how they work and everything and modifications and like all the different kinds
00:34:22 i'm like this is unnecessary and then from there i started printing out like little miniature
00:34:27 stuff because that was like the scale of models i wanted to make and then related videos on youtube
00:34:32 were like how to paint d&d minis and i started watching that i'm like oh it should be super cool
00:34:36 if i could like paint minis and learn how to like get the proper paints and mix the washes and all
00:34:39 the stuff and i'm just like this is completely irrelevant this is this is not anywhere on my
00:34:44 t-pose of skills why am i spending like hours and days on end researching like the proper like
00:34:50 kinds of of acrylic based miniatures paints and like i'm doing a comparison of like starter
00:34:55 kits that cost like 40 a pop i don't need to know any of this none of this is relevant go back and
00:35:00 learn more 3d you idiot yeah well what's wrong with us what are what are we gonna do how do you
00:35:11 ever like see an artist on youtube or on twitter or whatever that's just like does their one thing
00:35:18 and has been doing it for like 10 years how how'd they do that how how do people have the focus
00:35:25 to just be like i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do this forever i i mean i really don't know
00:35:37 it feels it feels i don't want to say it gets boring doing you know a thing i like
00:35:45 because that sort of implies that i will abandon it but i never really abandon anything i always
00:35:50 come back around to it over after a few years or months when i you know whatever the time period
00:35:55 is that i'm like i've you know i stopped doing crochet for a while and then i got back into it
00:36:00 and you know i stopped again it's just sort of like a skill that i hobby like i'm a hobby
00:36:05 habit i i collect hobbies and and grinding away at a single skill i feel like most people who
00:36:13 get extremely good at one thing don't make the conscious decision to grind away at that as a
00:36:20 skill they just do it because they like doing it all the time and for me the thing that i like doing
00:36:26 all the time is not it's not usually like a skill that i can make money off of or like an artistic
00:36:33 thing it's it's thinking about i don't know video game analysis and watching video game analysis
00:36:41 videos and and thinking about stuff stuff that isn't i mean i don't know i guess there's a
00:36:50 number of things that i do unconsciously all the time that i don't really have a way to turn into
00:36:58 something profitable but other people they they do the thing that they can turn into something
00:37:03 profitable all the time they just love doing it and i i envy that to an extent yeah i definitely
00:37:11 envy the focus because like the things that i do i i have like a complicated starting point right
00:37:17 of like i want to like make an animation or i want to make a comic or something and that requires
00:37:21 multiple skills already because you can't you know you have an artist who just draws like
00:37:27 i'm just going to draw furries and that's just what i do i just draw furries that's what i've
00:37:32 been doing since you know 2005 i'm really good at it i take commissions and i just everybody
00:37:37 knows exactly what my my mo is and i just do that i'm like because i want to tell stories with my art
00:37:43 like just by default it's like well now you're gonna do writing layout you know like there's so
00:37:48 many more skills involved so like right from the get-go it's like a multi-discipline goal but then
00:37:54 like as you learn more about those things all of those skills like branch off into other areas
00:37:59 and i just find myself subconsciously like asking myself questions like what if i did this or what
00:38:04 if i could do that and it just the my brain just kind of naturally hops from one connected point
00:38:11 to the next and all of a sudden i'm like knee deep and like learning how like different brands of
00:38:16 washes affect the paints on a dungeon and dragons miniature or a warhammer mini i'm like why am i here
00:38:22 how did i get here why is this my thing why do i have like a hundred dollars worth of like
00:38:28 mini paints in my amazon watch list right now like what is going on i just i just want to sit here
00:38:34 and focus on my one thing but i feel like i have at the same time like adhd and like hyper focus
00:38:43 at the same time where like all my attention jumps all the time but like in between jumps it's like
00:38:48 hyper fixated on that one thing before it jumps to the next thing become hyper fixated and uh
00:38:54 it's like antithetical to being productive yeah it's it's it's like you know in in a world where
00:39:02 time is not an issue and you can go on forever you will eventually it's like you're you're working
00:39:08 on you're leveling up many different skills uh one of uh you know like alternating which
00:39:14 skills you're leveling up rather than going full on strength or full on you know intelligence or
00:39:20 whatever you know dark souls or whatever so like you're you're you're spreading them out and eventually
00:39:27 they will all be maxed out but most human lives end before and most dark souls play chess and
00:39:34 sessions end before you've gotten to the point where you have enough xp to max out everything
00:39:40 so you will be constantly halfway there on everything and never at 100 on any one thing
00:39:46 and other people i don't know whether it's like right to say that other people just think differently
00:39:51 because i um i i get the sense that it's it's more of a uh it's like
00:40:01 no i can't i'm trying to think of the way to explain it it's like i think about drawing
00:40:08 and i draw and then i you know i get into the comic thing and i'm like okay i need to figure out
00:40:14 how to write the story i look into writing things and now i'm i'm going on websites and blogs that
00:40:21 are talking about writing for novels for books for short stories and i'm thinking maybe i could
00:40:26 write a book as well or add you know instead or afterwards or something like the knowledge you get
00:40:32 sort of takes you off in a different direction right it like opens up a new possibility for you
00:40:36 like you're thinking about writing for comics and someone's writing for novels like oh yeah i could
00:40:40 do that like i could do that and then like that seed is planted and it's like well if i was going
00:40:45 to write a book what would it be and then like all of a sudden that's now another thing in your
00:40:48 brain and it's just like well i'm gonna have to deal with that rattling around in the old gray
00:40:52 matter for the rest of my goddamn life now yeah and i'm like i'm wondering for the people who
00:40:58 don't branch off like that is it that they don't consider it or is it that they are just merely
00:41:05 uninterested in doing something different or is it like discipline is there someone who's just like
00:41:10 they have all those things in their brains and they're just like no fuck you this is the right thing to
00:41:14 do i mean i i suppose it could it could be any one of those things i'm thinking of like someone
00:41:22 like uh steven king for example he writes so much all the time so many books feasibly could you
00:41:33 imagine steven king getting into a different creative thing i mean you know if he just did it
00:41:40 one day he's like oh now he's a painter yeah that you could see it happening because creative people
00:41:45 they they do creative things but i get the feeling that it's not like he would i just couldn't imagine
00:41:54 him like deviating so completely from the thing he has done for so many years do you think i'm thinking
00:41:59 like is is it like i can't imagine how much discipline you would need to see all of these
00:42:06 creative things you could be doing and just say no every single time i feel like do you think in the
00:42:11 case of like someone like steven king it's because he's older and like didn't have the internet like
00:42:17 i'm sure like back in the day he was not you know there was no youtube for him to go look for writing
00:42:22 advice on he probably just like maybe he just started writing or maybe he got a book you know
00:42:26 that was just about that one thing that didn't have thumbnails and and the fucking related tab
00:42:31 on every page attempting him to go to other things just like this is what i'm gonna do
00:42:35 and it's a simpler time there's less distractions i've made up my mind
00:42:39 and like the path i go down to learn this does not have all these branching avenues that the
00:42:43 internet gives us now yeah i definitely think that could be part of it can you think of someone who's
00:42:50 young who who acts very focused on one thing i just i just think like commission artists and stuff
00:42:56 or like the first like really simple example they just like settle in their style and they just
00:43:02 they're just happy drawing like you know characters just character portraits and character
00:43:09 illustrations i'm like never really going to do in comics never really go into anything else
00:43:14 like that it's just like i'm going to draw this character i'm gonna draw this character i'm gonna
00:43:19 draw this character and um i don't know and then you have people who just animate they're just
00:43:25 they're just i mean i guess animation is like multi multi-discipline so maybe that's like
00:43:30 once you get into animation you feel like you're switching gears all the time and it kind of
00:43:34 yeah is interesting in and of itself but even then like i've done animation and like even while
00:43:38 animating it's like well then what if you made it a video game you know which is how like the
00:43:42 video game stuff started was like it started with animation then it pivoted into that because like
00:43:45 that was just the next step was like layering another skill on top of what was already there
00:43:49 and um i don't know i guess at some point it's like i started drawing as a little kid
00:43:55 and then it went to comics and then comics went to animation then animation went to games
00:43:59 it was just like layering new skills on top of each other before like the the last was even like
00:44:03 kind of like out of the oven yet and like some people just stop they just stop at one level
00:44:09 of abstraction which is like i'm just gonna draw or i'm just gonna write and i don't really
00:44:15 i don't know i don't have the self-control every time i've done something i've completed a work
00:44:22 it's like very much like because there was like a conscious uh active self-control going on to not
00:44:31 like go off into the weeds i wonder like if part of that is like not that the people who focus on
00:44:40 one thing sort of only get to level one or like only find one skill and then stick with it forever
00:44:47 i'm sure many people try a bunch of skills and then they find the one that they like the most
00:44:51 and they stay with that but also what happens is they sort of leave the other skills behind
00:44:57 because like with you um all of these things the the drawing the the animating the 3d modeling
00:45:04 and the game development like they they build on each other but you feel like you since you
00:45:10 have been doing all of these things potentially could do all of these different things for the
00:45:15 video game you could be the animator and you know all you know all all of the aspects of video game
00:45:22 creation that you've learned you would you would keep using all of those skills even though it's
00:45:29 very difficult to be a one-man army and make an entire thing uh with all of the the skills
00:45:36 that are required of it which is why most games are made with a team even a small one right right
00:45:40 so it's like if i if i wanted to make i don't know fucking i i i always have this idea for
00:45:50 animated music videos when i really listen to a song i'm thinking you know very very classic
00:45:56 like everybody knows this feeling and i'm like okay well i can draw i can animate a bit wouldn't
00:46:04 be cool if i did the drawing and the animation and and the you know all of all the things and
00:46:10 maybe even the music i mean usually i'm listening to music so i'm not thinking about that but
00:46:16 in in like a real life like sensible setting i would instead like be like commissioning a
00:46:25 team of animators to make the thing that i have the vision for i would direct it i wouldn't do
00:46:29 all of the work right god imagine imagine being able to have a team that just did stuff for you
00:46:39 oh oh the joy the joy of like all the ideas finally escaping my brain and just being out in the world
00:46:47 yeah and then you look at it and you're like i don't know this key frame here is not how i
00:46:51 would have seen it in my mind's eye it's like a little bit of uh scrap it burn it all it's not
00:46:57 in my perfect vision i should delete the channel start over move over entire animation team i will
00:47:03 do all of the work and then i try and i fail it's the feelings that that feeling of it not
00:47:14 oh get out of here professional programming team i'm going to program my game with elif
00:47:22 is that threads for is that why i i feel i thought i don't know much about that guy but i feel like
00:47:27 isn't it like more of a scam that he's playing like he says he's working on it but he really isn't
00:47:33 well there was one point taking the money i mean i'm sure i'm sure that's what he's doing now but
00:47:37 there was one point where like a company tiny build like worked with him he like he hire i don't
00:47:45 know if he hired them but like they decided to like help him make the game and they had a programmer
00:47:50 come in to like rewrite all of his code because it was a nightmare and he got mad that he couldn't
00:47:58 like work on the code himself anymore because this guy was coding way better than he was so he
00:48:03 fired the entire publisher developer and went back making it by himself
00:48:10 lol like he was so close to being free like it would have been out it could have been done by now
00:48:15 but i don't know because of that hubris he was like nah nah i got this and now we're like what three
00:48:21 years later and it still barely has progressed at all like why would he do that is it really like
00:48:29 i'm like not i've barely looked into this so i don't know if i'm like being stupid but like
00:48:35 from what small things i've heard he would have like i feel like he did that maybe to get away
00:48:42 with it taking an extremely long time and taking the money that's the the vibe i get from maybe
00:48:49 how people talk about him i mean at this point like everyone just convinced it's a scam
00:48:53 but i this was a few years ago when like people thought it was a scam it's super strange right
00:48:59 like if he had a team who could have finished it then he would have had a video game that you
00:49:04 could profit off of anyway like right i just i don't know it's so strange but i like i'm always
00:49:10 afraid of becoming that you know just like being so blinded by my own hubris that even even in the
00:49:17 face of like a team willing to help me i'm like no good to do it all myself like uh uh never go
00:49:26 full yandere dev i i feel like i could uh what i want in in like the the near future is for me to
00:49:37 make some of these comics and for you know my drawing skill to improve over time be like pretty good
00:49:43 and you know it'd be like something i could sell on on the on the store shelves or whatever i could
00:49:49 be like a brand leo malley almost uh who's you know he's got a very distinct cartoony style
00:49:56 that's very appealing and he's good at making this stuff but he's not like he's not like the biggest
00:50:03 like draw god of all time like the scott pilgrim increased in drawing quality as he went
00:50:08 and so he was definitely like improving it you know still so like as i get to a decent enough
00:50:16 point i can start and then i can get better as i go and then the big ideas i have for like
00:50:24 dude what if there's a video game of like punk and and stuff i could i then i would have like
00:50:29 money to to pay people to do that yeah yeah you want to just like get the ball rolling
00:50:35 and like start a franchise so people will want to work on the franchise you have the
00:50:39 money to pay people to work on the franchise and make it bigger and then there's snowballs
00:50:43 and you're like all right the momentum's going without me slaving away every single day to make
00:50:47 it happen i go to edgar right and hi all me is zaki it's a guys i want to make a comedy ghibli
00:50:56 film uh with bell with punk in it and they'll be like hell yeah it's like we get to work with give
00:51:02 and take literally our dream yeah oh no it's too cool i'm getting upset
00:51:12 oh god the future you know as long as i don't like throw in the towel it looks bright i have
00:51:21 i have more skill at art now than i did a few years ago when it was merely a twinkle in my eye
00:51:27 and now like the idea of making comics uh that have cool characters in them that i did and made
00:51:33 and i could you know it's it's it's looking like it's gonna go well the tezuka manga thing might
00:51:39 be a big old failure but i will definitely come commit to the thing i have and then finish it
00:51:46 whenever it's finished and uh there's more on the way god it's so cool the idea of the future
00:51:53 being better than right now that's what i like yeah i got like i got like three or four things in
00:51:59 the oven right now that i'm not talking about publicly man i'm stoked i'm stoked to see them
00:52:05 finished it'll be fucking cool a zoomie and the vertical slice and then a to me the vertical slice
00:52:12 to the vertical slices the vertical slices the vertical and horizontal slices slices slightly
00:52:20 to the lower left major this is smash bowl oh my god zoomie confirm the perpendicular slice yeah yeah
00:52:26 there we go somebody animate that not me though i'm too busy with other things
00:52:33 oh my god dude we kill it we made it to an hour we did it well 52 minutes but like we almost did it
00:52:42 do you think we should open up the speak pipe and listen to any uh things i was gonna say we
00:52:48 should go to the speak pipe but unlike ben saying we should not play every voicemail we should play
00:52:53 the voicemails that seem funny because oh my god uh there's over 25 already uh uh yeah there's like
00:53:03 26 more voicemails i don't know if do you want to listen to 26 voicemails not really but i don't
00:53:09 know how to tell which ones are good and which ones aren't the short ones are the best
00:53:17 oh no okay so this we're gonna play a game we're gonna play a game okay uh this is how
00:53:24 the voicemail is gonna work i'm gonna pick a voicemail that i think is gonna be good if it's good
00:53:31 thank god if it's bad you can uh shit on me relentlessly then you have to pick a voicemail
00:53:37 that's higher up like a newer one than that one the next okay and then we'll just keep going back
00:53:42 and forth until we get all the way to the newest one all right all right that's that's the plan
00:53:53 i'm gonna start with oh man we have to go back to the previous page i don't know if any of those
00:54:01 seem good those seem juicy there's six on the previous page yeah um all right i'm gonna pick
00:54:12 the fun all the way at the bottom the joker thread it's seven seconds so even if this is a
00:54:18 total bust not too much of our lives or wasted it's the last one on the first page the joker
00:54:24 thread not the joker the joker thread okay all right three two one go if nate doesn't upload a video
00:54:37 within three days i blow up a hospital um weak wait what what this was five days ago when did
00:54:47 nate upload the uh gets ghost in the shell uh review i thought it was more than five days ago but
00:54:56 maybe i'm wrong is this guy this is the joker a fucking idiot let's find out either way this
00:55:06 this voicemail did not age well best guy ever three days ago oh so this was pre dates that
00:55:15 the video dropped so do you think do you think nate popped into the speak pipe and uh saw that
00:55:20 and desperately threw together the video to save the hospital yeah it seems it seems likely
00:55:28 even though the video even though this was marked as unplayed before right now that's still definitely
00:55:33 what happened all right thank god for the video it came out after all these millions of years
00:55:42 incredible incredible 2020 is saved okay so now i have to choose one yes uh oh wait uh
00:55:52 how about smearg all right let's do smearg um one uh three two one play
00:56:03 hello and howdy i'll get right to the point i have an idea to present i've been listening
00:56:11 to a lot of hello internet and core text recently and on those shows they have sometimes what they
00:56:16 like to call a quote unquote book club segment i'd like to propose that as a potential segment the
00:56:23 pcp could have a quote unquote quote quote book club of its own you could take turns having one
00:56:32 of the co-hosts present one particularly interesting maybe analytical youtube video each week the other
00:56:39 co-hosts and listeners could then watch this video over the course of the week and it could
00:56:44 generate some hopefully interesting conversation for the next episode that is all thank you
00:56:54 see nice you had me you had me until you mess said youtube video because books high tier youtube
00:57:02 videos bottom tier but nate can't read so i'm glad that you included him uh books you gotta
00:57:10 find them and read though just go to archive videos just go to youtube.com have a let's read
00:57:18 of of the book an audiobook if you will i've heard of those um yeah i don't know i thought i think
00:57:27 munchie or some of us have had something of this kind of idea before it's just sort of
00:57:36 no one would do it ever no one would ever like it would be like last week hey guys i said we
00:57:42 should watch this video and or read this book have you got any of you guys done it everyone
00:57:47 says no everyone says oh i was gonna get around to that the conversation ruined um we get attempted
00:57:54 i suppose but like in this in this episode only us two would do it because we're the only ones here
00:58:02 it's true the only youtube video i've watched recently is uh episode one of the spongebob anime
00:58:08 which was removed from youtube well it fits removed i guess criminal that's that that's that it was
00:58:16 amazing did you see it before it was taken down i i have no idea what that is have you did you ever

01:00:01 and next week i might even say i watched it oh my god tune in next week everybody for gib's one
01:00:07 sentence reaction to spongebob anime episode one all right it's my turn to pick a voicemail again
01:00:14 isn't it shit uh you know what i'm gonna go with margar because margar did us good uh last episode
01:00:23 i was on so let's listen what margar has to say it's like a couple couple slots up from smirg
01:00:31 are you ready to go are you still here okay yes all right excellent three two one go margar here
01:00:41 pcp listeners and voicemail senders let my story be an example and testament to all of you
01:00:49 that you too can end up in voice jail for absolutely no reason if you just send good voicemails
01:00:58 just keep making good quality and you will indeed be punished for it just like society
01:01:05 is meant to function thank you ben yeah i mean you know when you mess with the bull society
01:01:13 you get the horns unfair treatment yeah that's what you this is a social commentary voicemail
01:01:20 service doesn't matter what you're doing you will get killed and fucked with yep there is no justice
01:01:27 there is no fairness there is no quality all will be crushed under the heel of our boot uh because
01:01:33 we can sorry well uh well i mean we didn't put you in there so that's true it's all ben's fault
01:01:40 ben's not here it's all ben's fault we go to take it up with ben saying dot com i'd say go kill ben
01:01:47 but it seems like he already killed himself yesterday and now he's busy dying yeah it takes a while
01:01:52 for him to to die he's very strong um i'd you know i'm sort of just drawn to the ones with the
01:02:00 people's names that i know there's crack here that's true coda for endless war and uh cool man
01:02:08 so let's do that all right three two one go hey ben did you see all the tweets about UFOs being
01:02:16 real it's really funny how everybody was saying space jam was real when they cancelled uh the
01:02:20 nba for the virus and now aliens are just real uh you're an astronomer retired space cam counselor
01:02:27 i know you're on top of it just thinking about you all right well that was that was for ben who is
01:02:33 who is currently bleeding out right now yeah yeah ben is exclamation point kill all over his bed
01:02:41 covered in puke i i did i do not know what he's referring to so i don't i guess i can't comment
01:02:46 on it yeah i don't either what the fuck aliens are real now i mean sure like it's 2020 so it
01:02:52 makes sense we're just pulling out all the stops for the uh the final arc of humanity
01:02:57 are they illegal though that's that's the question i mean technically yes right they're
01:03:02 definitely not citizens of any country so they would be illegal aliens shit i have to pick one
01:03:08 again i forgot uh uh uh uh uh uh uh let's let's listen to i don't like salad uh assuming this is
01:03:20 from simon because the the the next thing is simon at fuck you dot com all right three two one go
01:03:30 guys i don't really like salad what food don't you like lol ha ha oh oh terrible terrible i don't
01:03:40 like gay voicemails it's the worst food it doesn't digest well none none the worst you just roll up
01:03:48 to the drive-through you ask for a bad voicemail thinking it's gonna be a pleasant treat it's like
01:03:55 yeah i just need to pick me up right now and then as soon as like it touches your lips you're like a
01:04:00 fuck oh god why did i do this i forgot i forgot and then you feel like shit forever so thanks simon
01:04:07 love you buddy yeah um i i actually do have an answer to this what food don't i like marzipan
01:04:17 and i i've never had marzipan i don't even know what it is i've heard the word marzipan is a
01:04:22 thick icing like um thing you put on cakes to make them look really nice you can mold like little
01:04:29 figurines out of it and it's edible obviously um huh but maybe i have had this but just not
01:04:34 knowing what it was but it is it it does not taste like icing which is just sugary sugar um
01:04:42 it tastes it has a very distinct taste and i absolutely hate it it is so delicious looking
01:04:48 because it just reminds me of like really chunky like birthday cake ice cream and it's like ah it
01:04:55 should be the best thing ever but it's so odd and good and bad in fact and i hate it it sucks
01:05:03 something that nice looking should not taste like that that's what that's my food that i don't like
01:05:10 huh i'm tempted to try it now just to just have an opinion on this contentious issue i'm looking
01:05:17 up pictures of it not even looks familiar i don't have cake like ever so damn uh okay do i have a
01:05:26 real answer to this question um cucumbers i hate cucumbers the texture offends me the taste
01:05:34 isn't that bad but it's not good either so it's just like neutral taste with unpleasant texture
01:05:41 mm-hmm can't don't like it it brings down every salad it's ever been in don't recommend zero out of
01:05:49 ten celery celery is like bad because the texture is a little bit more pleasant yeah it has a taste
01:05:58 i don't really like i don't like the taste of celery i don't avoid it it's like a weird bitterness
01:06:04 yeah but like i don't know by itself it's it's not it's not terrible i'd rather have like that kind
01:06:12 of like downward kind of bitterness of celery than like the nothing like slop that is uh cucumber
01:06:22 so yeah but neither are very good especially like a slightly
01:06:26 un-fresh cucumber that's starting to mush
01:06:31 like sometimes that the crunch is enough like it you you crunch it it's like yeah it's crunchy
01:06:36 but when it's sort of like too wet it is kind of like what is this why yeah why does this exist
01:06:43 why are you're not a pickle yet so you haven't gone to something good you're just a worse version
01:06:49 of what you already are all right i guess i'm choosing one do it uh
01:07:00 none of these all right i guess i'll just do the next one application all right three two one go
01:07:09 so this is my application on the uh podge podge and uh reason reasons well there's clearly a shortage
01:07:20 of members and i'm a perfect guy for it i think i could leave sweet new angle to the pcb with my
01:07:27 food i can't tell if this quality is like part of the bit or completely accidental
01:07:32 intelligent conversation yeah and uh i guess uh i guess uh jones jones is slob another
01:07:41 oh my god well you know if you know if i wanna uh let me on uh uh sure sure okay i'll see you then
01:07:51 you're hired we have you have you you have the voice quality uh uh down pat to be on the pcp
01:08:02 you have our level of quality perfected yes we are we're starving for new members
01:08:10 seriously we need we need as many members as possible everybody should be joining the pcp
01:08:15 should be a new fad new craze should be should be able to if you go to patreon.com slash the
01:08:21 procrastinators and you become a patron you're automatically entered into the random drawing
01:08:29 to become a member of the pcp that will be decided uh 10 years after the last procrastinators podcast
01:08:37 member has died so if you want to be part of that drawing that will definitely happen be sure to
01:08:44 become a member yeah at patreon.com slash the procrastinators and you have to stay a patron
01:08:49 for that entire 10 year period even as we are slowly dying like flies every every month you're in
01:08:56 and uh your card clears is another entry into the contest so the longer you stay the more
01:09:03 chances you have i'm thinking of the implication of that is that we will all be dead in 10 years only
01:09:08 that's all the time we have doing the pcp we'll kill lucky
01:09:16 uh shit now i have to pick one don't i um hmm
01:09:23 fuck
01:09:28 um all right i'm just gonna how long we've been going for because i could i could just wrap this
01:09:34 up right now and pick the top voicemail i'm gonna do that we're gonna pick the last the
01:09:38 newest voicemail the last one we got a mere hour ago why munchie why
01:09:44 all right are you ready yep three two one go i am literally shaking and crying right now pcp
01:09:55 i want to know i want you to tell me why munchie left the patreon lounge i gave the pcp five dollars
01:10:04 to join the discord for perhaps the honor the privilege to have maybe one or two interactions
01:10:10 with the legendary munchie j trump and he's gone he's nowhere to be seen why why did munchie abandon
01:10:18 the patreon lounge i'm i'm shaking and crying how could you do this to me uh i didn't even know
01:10:28 that happened did you when when did that happen uh i feel like he's been gone for a long time or at
01:10:33 least i mean he never really looks at it does he most of us no i i i check you know occasionally
01:10:40 seeing what's going on same same um there's just so many uh uh channels in the the procrastinators
01:10:48 lounge i'm just like man that's a lot that's a lot to sift through but i only check the the main one
01:10:55 i guess the off topic usually the one i check as well yeah but uh if you really want to talk to
01:10:59 munchie there's an easy way to do it get on a plane go to boston uh find the crazy man just
01:11:06 listen listen for the extremely loud foot stomps and screaming you'll find him
01:11:14 oh man but but for real if you want to talk to munchie he's probably much more reachable
01:11:20 uh on endless war the ratty fuckers cop killers endless war discord server with slime is true
01:11:27 you just go in there uh you become a paragon of the community and then maybe munchie will
01:11:33 pay attention to you you'll you'll have to draw a lot of slime you'll have to become slime but
01:11:38 you know it's worth it yeah there's always you know uh price a price involved in meeting your
01:11:46 idols the people you respect you know and uh you know at first slime is like icky and gross
01:11:51 and you don't want slime but you'll learn to love it you'll learn to be addicted to it uh
01:11:56 and you'll make the a hair gal face every time oh oh sounds sounds great sounds like a grand
01:12:03 grand old time uh seriously i haven't talked to munchie in a long time i don't know why he's
01:12:09 he's uh sort of minimizing internet stuff i get the the sense i haven't heard from him
01:12:17 like exactly what he is trying to do but he's like he's been doing like what i did for the last
01:12:22 two weeks like ever since he started school and uh he's probably all the more powerful for it i
01:12:27 can't imagine the fucking titan of of divine energy he emanates now i mean the other day um
01:12:38 he just came into one of the discords i'm in um and he was just sort of like
01:12:43 ratatouille like at everyone ratatouille now rat spewley right now and then like i was watching
01:12:50 ratatouille with him and kazi and a bunch of other people uh like five a.m so he's he's alive
01:12:57 he's doing stuff but he's like with you know he's not looking at twitter he's not doing
01:13:05 really any sort of discord watching looking at he's he's just watching rat spewley
01:13:12 is he making stuff or is he just kind of just vibing and enjoying life he is currently
01:13:17 doing a lot of coding for endless war because there's a big update coming i don't know i'm
01:13:24 you probably have no idea but they they've been a lot of big updates recently the in the the endless
01:13:30 war map uh has been increased in size in the in the way of like now there used to be districts you
01:13:40 would type exclamation point go to district and within those districts there are a number of
01:13:45 like locations like there would be a pub in some area there's a cafe there's a uh the you know the
01:13:55 slime labs where you can make a slimeoid various places around the city and now in those places i
01:14:02 haven't even really done it myself but now there are individual streets that you can go down within
01:14:06 those areas and it's like orders of magnitude more exploration you can do and it's very complicated
01:14:15 i've seen a few images of like the behind the scenes of like what it looks like to program
01:14:19 something like that for discord and it is there've been lots of like hurdles trying to get discord
01:14:25 to cooperate with such a strange thing because it's a mod that like involves hundreds of players
01:14:33 asking the bot for like you know you know a server is like responding to all of these requests
01:14:40 and then all of these different like to be in a district or a location gives you an invisible role
01:14:48 and there's only so many roles that can exist and so they've had to work around that
01:14:54 oh Jesus it's like it's it's like a nightmare and i assume he's working very hard to get whatever's
01:15:00 happening are we going to get to the point where endless war is going to have to like move to its
01:15:05 own native application i feel like they're gonna hit the limits of discord at the rate they're
01:15:10 going i there's definitely been moments where that has been like on the table as a thing to
01:15:15 definitely think about um i'm not like in with the developer crowd discord like i i don't know
01:15:23 exactly what's going on but i've heard talk of like but that but also part of it being on discord
01:15:29 is the point so like yeah they would want to keep it there if they can i suppose like some of its
01:15:34 identity is very i mean like the whole pitch is like you know it's a mml you play in a discord
01:15:39 server so like if it's not a discord server part of its identity is lost but like i would hate to
01:15:44 have discord hamper the game's development and growth but interesting very interesting good to
01:15:52 hear munchies spend all that money went to art school is doing nothing but programming
01:15:57 lol i mean the whole thing with covid and him not being able to go to the lessons that he bought
01:16:06 is like so upsetting dumb dude it's like it piss like legitimately pisses me off because like we
01:16:13 had all those arguments and like his big reason for going to school in the first place was to
01:16:19 meet people and be in the like the be in the school around the people that was the entire point that
01:16:25 was his big defense was that like i'll be able to pay for it i have a way to do that but i just
01:16:30 want to be there and mingle and now like the whole reason for going to school is like invalidated
01:16:36 yeah and it's the teacher is teaching is a lot less useful through like zoom or whatever
01:16:45 and that there was like there was like i can't remember exactly what it was but it's like
01:16:52 a number of classes that you know they got basically ruined but he wasn't reimbursed
01:16:58 for the things that he like the pandemic ruined for him he still had to pay money
01:17:05 for oh no it was it was it was the student accommodation since he couldn't be in the the
01:17:12 campus uh he was staying with uh with kazi but the um student accommodation refunded for housing
01:17:20 they did not get refund they just still had to pay that lawsuits incoming as soon as this
01:17:25 fucking covid shit is over every school if the schools aren't refunding housing they're all
01:17:30 gonna get hit with fucking lawsuits and they deserve to get fucked in every single one of them holy
01:17:34 shit yeah that's ridiculous it sucks the whole thing so god the internet stinks real life stinks
01:17:46 what's even what's even it's even the point what's even what are we even gonna do god damn it
01:17:52 the final arc of humanity is a real downer that's okay i'll just i'll just draw a funny
01:17:59 comic about a lady with a gun she'll shoot she'll she'll say yeehaw and shoot some enemies that's
01:18:05 that's the the pitch for my comic by the way uh sick pre-ordered immediately
01:18:13 all right well unless you have anything you'd like to add i guess we can call this episode
01:18:20 a wrap uh i'll just like to reiterate that i will be streaming twitch.tv slash gib and take
01:18:30 for the month of august every weekday from 11 a.m roughly uh to 7 30 p.m bst which is
01:18:41 british summertime and you can adjust for your own time zone come and see me draw and be frustrated
01:18:48 at some difficult parts probably and that'll be that'll be going on for as long as i can
01:18:53 fucking stand sick i'll probably stop by now and then see how things are going sounds pretty cool
01:19:01 yeah uh don't forget patreon.com slash the procrastinators if you want to support this
01:19:08 podcast uh we got what like how many bonus episodes we got now for five dollars and up
01:19:14 we got more than 52 i can't remember the holy shit cannot remember the exact three or more bonus
01:19:23 episodes and we just guys just recorded a new one a couple days ago right no i'm thinking of weeks
01:19:28 of the year how many do we actually have we have we have one bonus lie where we have one bonus
01:19:34 episode per month it's been going for a while i was on the last one let me just check what the
01:19:39 file name for that was i figure since you were on it you would have had this right there right
01:19:45 there ready to go no i'm stupid uh unfortunate shit uh oh no i didn't remember what the number was
01:19:56 so i just called it bonus episode we got a lot of bonus episodes when there's a lot of them
01:20:01 they're really fucking good oh we just had a new one yeah the new one was me and ben talking about
01:20:08 how uh we uh tits it was just me and ben talking about tits and breasts and it was really fucking
01:20:16 epic and it's not as crude as it sounds we got along a lot of interesting uh tangential topics
01:20:24 about that and it was really good you know only five dollars gets you access to an entire
01:20:31 discussion about titties plus tons of other episodes with similarly interesting topics
01:20:37 it's it's it's it just bleeds value uh you'd be a fool not to pay five dollars a month over on
01:20:43 patreon.com slash the procrastinators and if for some reason five dollars a little too bougie for you
01:20:48 all you proliterates and get in at the one dollar tier gives you access to the the patreon discord
01:20:54 minus munchie maybe we'll drag him back in someday we're all there having a good time
01:20:58 minus munchie and uh it's great it's a great time it's fun go check that out if you want to
01:21:04 leave voicemails uh that's speakpipe.com slash pcp voicemail uh we'll listen to some of them
01:21:12 maybe someday nate will come back and curate them uh but until then it's just whatever
01:21:17 game we come up for listening to them so put your best foot forward and maybe you'll get on the show
01:21:22 and not end up in voice jail and uh we have twitter uh at tpcrastinators to keep you updated on the
01:21:29 state of our youtube channel if it ever will be revived forever get the videos back um
01:21:35 are we are we still trying to find all the videos i know ben was starting to get that going uh to
01:21:40 like kind of like see if we had backups of everything and in case we uh have to unfortunately
01:21:45 face that reality which seems to be ever more uh like the case because yeah they just there's nothing
01:21:52 happening um yeah we're we're still emailing them so eventually doing our best but there's not much
01:22:00 you can do unfortunately it's fucking youtube if you go on twitter at team youtube and at the tpcrastinator
01:22:07 what was our twitter the procrastinators yeah at at tpcrastinators at tpcrastinators uh just let
01:22:13 them know that you want the channel back yeah doesn't hurt if you have backups if you have
01:22:19 backups of uh some of the videos uh let us know because we're trying i think ben is putting
01:22:24 together a spreadsheet just like where all the other videos are and what we need to get back what
01:22:28 we already have so uh in case we have to just re-upload everything from scratch it'll be good to
01:22:34 know what we do and do not have access to so that would be a huge help and uh other than that i think
01:22:40 we're ready to end the episode everybody thanks for listening uh goodbye goodbye
