00:00:00 Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:05 I'm the best guy ever, and we're joined today by Hippo Gibbontake.
00:00:11 Boy, howdy, bitches.
00:00:15 Ah, Munchy.
00:00:17 You know, some shows have theme songs that have cute little jingle catchphrases,
00:00:22 and we just have Nate saying hello in the exact same tone of voice every single time.
00:00:26 I don't know how we do it.
00:00:27 Munchy, we have a theme song.
00:00:29 We have an opening jingle.
00:00:31 Or something right?
00:00:32 It's not memorable at all, it doesn't even count.
00:00:34 I mean, who would remember that?
00:00:36 I remember that it's like guitar strums.
00:00:38 Munchy, literally everyone remembers the theme song that I made like four years ago.
00:00:43 Not that one.
00:00:44 I mean, that's true.
00:00:45 That's our outro now.
00:00:46 That's our outro song.
00:00:47 Is that the outro?
00:00:48 I don't even watch it.
00:00:49 Yeah, we use this as the outro song.
00:00:50 Listen to the PCP once in a while.
00:00:51 Okay, that's Ben, and also Jesse.
00:00:53 Yep, that's me.
00:00:54 Tom's here.
00:00:55 I come before all of you, a changed man.
00:00:58 Yeah?
00:00:59 Oh, yeah.
00:01:00 Oh, boy.
00:01:01 Tell me.
00:01:02 How's that?
00:01:03 Tell me more.
00:01:04 We're going to get into it later, I guess.
00:01:06 No, cancel.
00:01:07 Tom's kicked.
00:01:08 I don't want it.
00:01:09 Do you have an adamantium spine now, like bullseye?
00:01:12 Did you finally?
00:01:13 God, I wish.
00:01:14 God, I wish.
00:01:15 I was hoping for that.
00:01:17 Okay, let me just say that first of all, last week was the Pony episode, and everybody
00:01:23 loved it and especially loved my story about the roller coaster.
00:01:27 So, if you haven't heard that, go listen to it.
00:01:30 You know, I'm thinking about bringing back the Highlights channel just for that story.
00:01:34 The Razorback?
00:01:35 The Diamondback.
00:01:36 Diamondback.
00:01:37 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:01:38 Everyone, praise me, praise me.
00:01:40 I appreciate that.
00:01:41 You know, I always think about that.
00:01:43 Like, oh man, we should cut out the good parts and upload them on their own.
00:01:49 I mean, we definitely should.
00:01:50 And then I think about how we have that Highlights channel, but then I think about like, no,
00:01:54 if I'm cutting out my good parts, I'm putting them on my channel.
00:01:57 Fuck those guys.
00:01:58 I mean, that's the problem.
00:02:01 Anything said on the podcast is the intellectual property of all of us.
00:02:05 Communism in the PCP.
00:02:07 Oh my God.
00:02:08 No.
00:02:09 Communism, that's capitalism.
00:02:10 That's the same way you-
00:02:11 Wait, no, no, no.
00:02:12 If we-
00:02:13 Immediately.
00:02:14 We're immediately into this.
00:02:15 Why?
00:02:16 If we all-
00:02:17 Shut up.
00:02:18 Shut the fuck up.
00:02:19 I'm just saying the definition, if we all mutually own the means of production, that's capitalism.
00:02:23 I mean communism.
00:02:24 Oh, you slipped up.
00:02:25 That's the same line you dropped on me when you took my hilarious, I'm just being cool
00:02:29 joke and put it on a t-shirt and tried to reap the fucking benefits of it.
00:02:33 Yeah, it was on the show.
00:02:34 That's my intellectual property.
00:02:36 Well, guess what?
00:02:37 Now we all own it.
00:02:38 So there you go.
00:02:39 Yeah, that's-
00:02:40 We don't.
00:02:41 I'm gonna sell a better version of the shirt someday.
00:02:42 Hey, I've got a small announcement and that today, August 18th, the day we're recording,
00:02:49 is my dog Sessho's second birthday.
00:02:52 It's his birthday today.
00:02:53 Oh my god.
00:02:54 And he's two years old and he's sweet.
00:02:56 Time to put it down.
00:02:57 I just came-
00:02:58 Now how is his diet coming?
00:02:59 Because he was just so unbelievably chunky and just like honestly fat.
00:03:04 Like honestly-
00:03:05 He's not fat.
00:03:06 Use the word fat.
00:03:07 Obeseven.
00:03:08 Like a sausage dog.
00:03:09 I don't know about obese.
00:03:10 It's fucked up of you to say.
00:03:11 He's not obese.
00:03:12 He was double his size.
00:03:14 He was double his specie size.
00:03:15 We all know that BMI is a terrible indicator.
00:03:19 You need to use more advanced metrics to determine dog obesity.
00:03:23 You need to use skin fold calipers.
00:03:25 That's right.
00:03:26 And measure the waist and things of that nature.
00:03:28 Why is it considered wrong for a dog to be fat?
00:03:30 They don't have to do anything.
00:03:31 They don't have a job.
00:03:32 They can be as fucking obese as they want.
00:03:34 I mean if they're fat enough, they'll fucking die.
00:03:35 I want my dog to be fat.
00:03:36 They'll fucking die.
00:03:37 That means he's well fed.
00:03:38 It means no.
00:03:39 No.
00:03:41 Yeah.
00:03:42 You know what?
00:03:43 I'm convinced.
00:03:45 Here's, I guess, here's a progress pic.
00:03:47 Give it a second.
00:03:48 It's uploading.
00:03:49 He's, you know...
00:03:50 Oh my goodness.
00:03:53 Lay on his side.
00:03:55 Emotionless.
00:03:56 Emotionless.
00:03:57 Progress might not be the word I would use in this.
00:04:00 Are you sure that's not a picture of a dog corpse?
00:04:03 Listen, I want it to be known.
00:04:05 That name.
00:04:06 You think of Nate in your mind.
00:04:08 He lifts.
00:04:09 He runs.
00:04:10 He's a fitness sort of guy.
00:04:11 His dog, the fattest dog on earth.
00:04:14 He's built like a faucet.
00:04:16 It's not his fault.
00:04:17 Nate, I just have to assume that he gets kibble.
00:04:20 Just lines in every one of his pockets and he's just,
00:04:22 oh, Seshaw, just come over here
00:04:23 and then just fucking pour his kibble down his throat
00:04:25 as hard and fast as he can.
00:04:26 It's his birthday.
00:04:27 You're not allowed to fat shame him on his birthday.
00:04:30 He's doing everything right.
00:04:32 Can you even pick him up?
00:04:35 We were, he is kind of hard to pick up.
00:04:39 He has a,
00:04:40 Are you saying it's a two man job?
00:04:42 It's a two man job to lift.
00:04:45 You have a system of police when you need to get him off.
00:04:48 We just went to PetSmart.
00:04:49 We got him his birthday toy.
00:04:51 We got him some birthday treats.
00:04:52 And then we went straight to the dog park.
00:04:54 We were there hanging out for a while.
00:04:56 We just left.
00:04:57 Oh, it's a beautiful place.
00:04:58 He's sniffing.
00:04:59 He's hanging out with the other boys.
00:05:00 He's going around having a good time.
00:05:02 And I'm going to go pick up Michelle and him later
00:05:04 after he's had his fill.
00:05:05 He's just the best little boy.
00:05:07 He's doing so great out there.
00:05:08 Pick them both up from dog and girlfriend kindergarten.
00:05:11 He's thriving.
00:05:13 He is thriving.
00:05:14 Dog parks are girlfriend kindergarten.
00:05:16 Can we get some dog emotes in the chat for Secho's birthday, please?
00:05:20 Thank you.
00:05:21 But I just want to let you all guys all know,
00:05:23 as I'm sure you'll remember from our famous episode on Furries,
00:05:27 there was that one fur suitor of a kangaroo
00:05:29 that had the giant, giant stomach.
00:05:32 I'm going to get like a really shitty thumbnail to show you guys,
00:05:34 but then a living fall will be able to show like a real image in the show notes.
00:05:37 But just take a look at like this.
00:05:39 I think this is the perfect representation of what Secho will become
00:05:42 if he were turning into a fursuit.
00:05:44 I mean, this is just like...
00:05:45 Oh, no.
00:05:47 That's not right.
00:05:49 That looks like an ancient like Roman torture device.
00:05:52 Like you put someone in there and you boil it
00:05:54 and you make it and they burn.
00:05:56 Oh, dude.
00:05:57 You know what I mean?
00:05:58 So inside there, like there's a human inside there, right?
00:06:00 But like the belly is some sort of like bomb.
00:06:02 I remember like...
00:06:03 Yeah, so the iron ball or something.
00:06:05 I'm not sure if it was this one,
00:06:07 but there are many suits like this as I'm sure you can imagine.
00:06:09 It's extremely arousing like 90% of the population.
00:06:12 And so I made an edit of one of them where it's two robs
00:06:15 on either side of them from the subspace emissary
00:06:17 and they're pulling apart the giant subspace bomb that is his stomach.
00:06:21 So that's what I was imagining.
00:06:22 That's disgusting.
00:06:24 Yeah, suiting in that count as vor,
00:06:26 like he's big and fat and there's a person inside there.
00:06:29 Is that...
00:06:30 I don't know, dude.
00:06:32 Was it deleted?
00:06:33 Did someone delete it?
00:06:34 Why was it deleted?
00:06:35 No.
00:06:36 Oh my God.
00:06:37 In the gross disgusting audio links.
00:06:38 Oh no one can make fun of my fucking dog.
00:06:39 Oh no one can know the truth.
00:06:41 I have a fucking force feeding him four.
00:06:43 All my dog can be able to eat me one day.
00:06:45 I watched this movie many times.
00:06:47 I just watched again the other day,
00:06:49 the movie Seven, directed by David Fincher
00:06:51 starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman,
00:06:53 great detective, weird psycho story.
00:06:55 And the guy, the bad guy kills people
00:06:58 based on the Seven Deadly Sins
00:07:00 because he's trying to, whatever, correct society or whatever.
00:07:02 And the first one they'll find...
00:07:04 It's the edgiest movie I've ever seen in my life
00:07:09 and I absolutely love it.
00:07:10 I watch it all the time.
00:07:11 It's so good.
00:07:12 I am Jesus Christ and Satan in one body.
00:07:15 And the first kill they find is a super fat guy
00:07:19 who, there was a gun to his head
00:07:21 and he was forced to continuously eat spaghetti
00:07:23 until his stomach exploded.
00:07:24 His skull shut and just kept feeding me.
00:07:26 He fed me.
00:07:27 He fed me.
00:07:28 Pretty much.
00:07:29 That's pretty much how it went down.
00:07:30 That's what you're going to do to your dog
00:07:32 on his third birthday.
00:07:33 Well, no, what's the rationale behind that?
00:07:37 Okay, I'm going to force this person to eat more,
00:07:39 like, obviously, eating more to get him more fat.
00:07:42 Oh, well, I'll tell you why.
00:07:43 Like, most of you are just making the problem, really.
00:07:45 No, no, no, no.
00:07:46 Okay, the guy was already incredibly fat.
00:07:48 Sure.
00:07:49 The bad guy was aware that he thinks that, you know,
00:07:52 Gluttony's a sin.
00:07:53 He doesn't like this big fat guy.
00:07:54 Did he also, like...
00:07:55 So he comes to his...
00:07:56 Aside from being fat,
00:07:57 did he, like, do anything else that was bad?
00:08:00 No.
00:08:01 His crime was simply being really fat.
00:08:03 Why that guy?
00:08:04 That's correct.
00:08:05 Yeah, there's lots of really fat people.
00:08:07 And this man would kill them, I assume.
00:08:09 It's one of those where the villain thinks he's deep
00:08:11 and that he's not just a crazy asshole idiot.
00:08:14 Like, another thing he does is he goes to, like,
00:08:17 a model's house and he cuts off her nose
00:08:20 so she'll be horribly disfigured.
00:08:21 But he, like, he bandages her so she won't die.
00:08:23 And in the one hand, he gives her a telephone
00:08:25 to call for help.
00:08:26 And in the other hand,
00:08:27 he gives her a bottle of sleeping pills.
00:08:29 So she can choose to kill herself
00:08:31 so that she won't have to deal with being scarred forever.
00:08:33 Or she could call the cops and live,
00:08:35 but she'll be disfigured and she kills herself.
00:08:37 Because society's fucked up, man.
00:08:39 It's so fucked up.
00:08:40 It's about, like, so superficial.
00:08:42 Every time I watch that movie, I just really...
00:08:44 I hate John Doe so much.
00:08:46 He's such a hypocrite.
00:08:48 And, like, I guess that's the point.
00:08:50 Because, like, the whole movie, you know, he's trying to be deep.
00:08:52 Like, he thinks, like, oh, it's your fault I'm killing you
00:08:55 because everyone is so bad.
00:08:57 That's why they have to...
00:08:58 But, like, I...
00:08:59 Not to spoil it, but his final victim
00:09:01 totally did nothing wrong at all.
00:09:03 Yeah.
00:09:04 He is willing to kill innocents.
00:09:06 He is.
00:09:07 And that's not exactly what I do.
00:09:08 And, like, he makes up some...
00:09:10 He makes up some flimsy...
00:09:11 It's not the coolest thing.
00:09:13 He makes up some flimsy justification
00:09:15 for how it could fit his stupid guidelines
00:09:17 and his dumb gimmick.
00:09:18 And he's like, oh, no, because you'll be so mad
00:09:21 that I killed a totally unisted person
00:09:23 that you'll be Wrath.
00:09:24 Yeah, yeah.
00:09:25 And the kill will be the true villain.
00:09:26 His final one.
00:09:27 And that's, like, yeah, makes no sense.
00:09:28 You're just an idiot.
00:09:29 Let's...
00:09:30 Let's spoil it a little...
00:09:31 Okay, spoilers the next, like, minute or whatever.
00:09:33 So, the point of the movie is
00:09:35 he eventually...
00:09:36 He creates Wrath out of his actions
00:09:38 out of one of the two police officers,
00:09:40 which is Brad Pitt, who's, like, investigating this guy.
00:09:43 He turns him into Wrath
00:09:45 as his final masterpiece of the final sin.
00:09:47 And he, John Doe, is Envy,
00:09:49 who envies the cop in his simple life.
00:09:51 And he kills his wife and chops off her head
00:09:54 and as it delivered, like, to their final, like, showdown place.
00:09:57 And it's gonna...
00:09:58 So it's still has to trick him into becoming a murderer,
00:10:00 which he succeeds at,
00:10:01 because society, man, what?
00:10:03 It's kind of...
00:10:04 It's what?
00:10:05 Is that even a society problem?
00:10:06 I don't know about that one.
00:10:07 I don't know about that one.
00:10:08 I hate how Morgan Freeman is, like,
00:10:10 trying to stop him from shooting John Doe,
00:10:12 because it's like, oh, don't do it.
00:10:14 Don't do it.
00:10:15 You'll fulfill his prophecy.
00:10:17 You'll play right into his hands.
00:10:18 Who cares? He's gonna be fucking dead.
00:10:20 It doesn't matter.
00:10:21 His prophecy is fucking stupid.
00:10:23 It's that old JRP trope of,
00:10:24 if you kill the bad guy, you're as bad as him.
00:10:26 You're automatically as bad as the bad guy.
00:10:28 The only thing that I wish had been different
00:10:31 is that before Brad Pitt shot him,
00:10:33 he leaned in close and said,
00:10:34 you know this is fucking stupid, right?
00:10:36 This makes no sense and your plan is wrong
00:10:38 and didn't shot him.
00:10:39 I fucking love that movie.
00:10:41 I watch it all the time.
00:10:42 Like, just so you know,
00:10:44 I'm gonna kill you,
00:10:45 but I don't feel like I'm wrath.
00:10:47 I don't feel like you succeeded.
00:10:49 I think you're a failure. Goodbye. Bam.
00:10:51 Well, that's why he should have let the courts take care of it.
00:10:54 He should have let society deal with this guy.
00:10:56 That's what Morgan Freeman's saying.
00:10:58 Morgan Freeman's disgusting.
00:10:59 He doesn't deserve my taxpayer money
00:11:01 to pay for his trial. Fuck him.
00:11:03 Well, that's...
00:11:04 I mean, he probably would have got off
00:11:05 in an insanity play anyway.
00:11:07 I don't even think Brad...
00:11:09 What would Brad Pitt have even been convicted of?
00:11:11 I mean, he did kill a man
00:11:13 who was not...
00:11:14 Yeah, but like in circumstances,
00:11:16 he would have got off with a slap.
00:11:17 He's a cop. Come on.
00:11:19 He did just kill his wife.
00:11:21 I think if your wife's severed head is in a box,
00:11:23 I think they put you in court
00:11:25 and they're like,
00:11:26 okay, we can all see why you did that.
00:11:28 He'd have gotten like six months of community service.
00:11:30 You know what he'd probably fucking get?
00:11:31 Remember in that other Samuel Jackson movie,
00:11:34 A Time to Kill when he kills those two guys
00:11:36 who raped and mutilated his daughter?
00:11:38 Is that the one?
00:11:40 Yes, he deserves to die and I hope they burn in hell.
00:11:43 Yeah, and even though he literally did it,
00:11:45 everyone knows they did jury nullification
00:11:47 and just said, no, innocent.
00:11:48 He gets to go free.
00:11:49 You know Brad Pitt's going to get that shit.
00:11:51 No one's going to convict this guy
00:11:53 of killing like a serial killer who doesn't kill the wife.
00:11:56 He's going to get like a month of mandatory
00:11:58 emotional counseling or something.
00:12:00 When you respond in,
00:12:02 in like some sort of like code in your DNA,
00:12:04 there's some sort of like constant tornado
00:12:06 of trash and filth just all around you,
00:12:08 constantly blowing and picks up speed.
00:12:10 And that's weird old like movies from the 2000s
00:12:13 that you're just bringing up the PCP.
00:12:15 It was last samurai.
00:12:16 Now it's seven.
00:12:17 It's going to be some,
00:12:18 it's going to be fucking,
00:12:19 how the Grinch did Christmas.
00:12:20 I watched a lot of starring Jim Carrey next.
00:12:22 Yeah.
00:12:23 I watched a lot of movies.
00:12:24 What can I say?
00:12:25 You know, the Grinch,
00:12:26 the Jim Carrey Grinch is a great film.
00:12:28 It's so good.
00:12:29 It's so good.
00:12:30 I'm so interested in it.
00:12:31 It's revisionist history and that it wasn't good.
00:12:33 I'm so sick of people.
00:12:34 Was it actually good?
00:12:35 It's actually kind of good, yeah.
00:12:37 It's great.
00:12:38 People have always pretended that it's not good
00:12:40 and I don't know why.
00:12:41 Me and Ben watched it.
00:12:42 It's leagues better than the cartoon.
00:12:44 We watched it like last time I was here
00:12:46 like a couple of months ago.
00:12:47 And I expected it to be like kind of like boring
00:12:50 just like another kid's movie
00:12:51 because I remember it being really funny.
00:12:53 I wanted to watch it
00:12:54 because I thought it was going to be really funny
00:12:55 and it was.
00:12:56 And it was just incredible
00:12:57 because Jim Carrey as the Grinch
00:12:58 is the best like typed cast person
00:13:00 like in the world.
00:13:01 Like it is just the perfect combination.
00:13:03 I feel like after the events of the Grinch
00:13:05 starring Jim Carrey,
00:13:06 that interpretation of the Grinch
00:13:07 went on a grand like America Trek
00:13:10 and found in Slime City
00:13:12 and was the original man
00:13:13 and started the original film.
00:13:14 What's the connection?
00:13:15 He just looks like the kind of guy
00:13:17 who he does have that look about him.
00:13:20 You put that Grinch suit
00:13:22 in like a business suit on top of it
00:13:25 and had him smoking a cigar.
00:13:27 He might be the founder.
00:13:28 He might be the final boss.
00:13:29 He might be N1 or N0
00:13:31 at the head of Slime Corp.
00:13:33 Jim Carrey is the Grinch.
00:13:35 Jim Carrey.
00:13:37 I like how every single shot
00:13:40 in live action Grinch
00:13:41 is a Dutch angle.
00:13:42 Like it's just constantly skewed.
00:13:44 Like they cannot center the camera.
00:13:46 They cannot like focus
00:13:47 or balance it whatsoever.
00:13:48 The camera is like in a centrifuge
00:13:49 the entire time.
00:13:50 Well maybe that's to symbolize
00:13:51 that the whole movie is taking place
00:13:52 inside a twisting falling snowflake
00:13:54 which you see at the beginning.
00:13:56 Wow.
00:13:58 It was really fucked up
00:13:59 how the Grinch just tied up St. Louis who
00:14:01 and he just shoved her through
00:14:02 the fucking trash compactor
00:14:03 in the postal office.
00:14:04 She didn't deserve that.
00:14:05 That didn't fit into his theme
00:14:06 of killing only the fools
00:14:07 who deserved it
00:14:08 who liked Christmas.
00:14:09 She didn't even like Christmas
00:14:10 at that point in the movie.
00:14:11 What the fuck Grinch?
00:14:12 That was, you know,
00:14:13 I would have called it a gizomed
00:14:14 Coots Verk if it wasn't for that one moment
00:14:16 but it really broke my immersion.
00:14:18 You know, I wish that at the end of 7
00:14:20 Brad Pitt's character had said
00:14:21 oh yeah, well guess what?
00:14:23 Secretly, I'm you the whole time.
00:14:25 I'm Tyler Durden.
00:14:26 You killed your own wife.
00:14:29 So, how do you like that?
00:14:31 Bitch.
00:14:32 And maybe Christmas isn't so bad after all.
00:14:35 And then Brad Pitt carved
00:14:37 the stuffed who beast.
00:14:39 He got the greatest drift of all
00:14:41 that Christmas.
00:14:42 His wife's sever head in the mail.
00:14:43 You know what?
00:14:44 Kevin Spacey just wanted to teach him
00:14:45 the true meaning of the holidays.
00:14:47 You know what is like
00:14:48 the worst, most decadent convenience
00:14:51 that we have?
00:14:52 Yeah.
00:14:53 By which I mean it's a good thing
00:14:54 but I lack the self-control
00:14:55 to have it in my life.
00:14:57 It's having YouTube
00:14:59 on the PlayStation 4.
00:15:01 On the TV.
00:15:02 Because every night I lay down
00:15:04 and I'm like oh boy,
00:15:05 I'm gonna watch a movie.
00:15:06 What great fucking movie
00:15:07 will I expose myself?
00:15:08 I'm gonna expand
00:15:09 by cultural palette,
00:15:10 by watching a great movie tonight.
00:15:12 And instead it's like
00:15:13 oh no wait,
00:15:14 I better listen to Noah Caldwell
00:15:15 Gervais talk about
00:15:16 Baldur's Gate for three hours.
00:15:17 Yeah.
00:15:18 Damn.
00:15:19 Hey, you know on that
00:15:20 I just watched the first time.
00:15:21 Totally worth it.
00:15:22 I just watched it.
00:15:23 Yeah.
00:15:24 After all the...
00:15:25 It's worthless but I like it.
00:15:26 Yeah.
00:15:27 It's great.
00:15:28 I want more of it all the time.
00:15:30 The new Quentin Serentino movie,
00:15:31 Sharon Tate,
00:15:32 what's his name?
00:15:33 What's that?
00:15:34 Roman Polanski.
00:15:35 I went and I watched
00:15:36 Rosemary's Baby
00:15:37 with Michelle just the other day
00:15:38 and it was great.
00:15:39 It was like the first
00:15:40 like modern horror ever made
00:15:42 or something.
00:15:43 It was pretty fucking dope.
00:15:44 Way into it.
00:15:45 Highly recommended.
00:15:46 I've always been like
00:15:48 for a while there
00:15:49 I was just totally enraptured
00:15:51 in the typhoon of YouTube content
00:15:53 and I would basically consume it
00:15:55 to the exclusion of all other things
00:15:57 but I've recently like
00:15:59 really flipped that around.
00:16:01 I'm almost exclusively...
00:16:02 Like I do watch some YouTube series
00:16:04 there's a specific one
00:16:05 that I think Hippo's also watched
00:16:06 about a guy walking across Wales
00:16:08 in a straight line.
00:16:09 Fantastic.
00:16:10 I like that a lot
00:16:11 but like I barely watch
00:16:12 eating like vlogs
00:16:13 or anything like that now.
00:16:14 Now it's all movies
00:16:15 and all like real pieces of art
00:16:17 that I actually enjoy
00:16:18 and it's fucking fantastic.
00:16:19 It's so good.
00:16:20 My audible has never gotten
00:16:22 as much use as it has
00:16:23 in like the past like two months
00:16:24 and it's fantastic.
00:16:25 I should get into some of those books.
00:16:27 On the one hand there's like
00:16:29 oh don't consume like
00:16:31 easy to consume content
00:16:33 because it's not as rich as
00:16:35 the rich content that you know you like more.
00:16:37 It's good.
00:16:38 Yeah but like
00:16:39 I have had this sort of like
00:16:41 in the back of my head
00:16:43 in the back of my mind for like ever
00:16:45 that I should get around to
00:16:47 experiencing every video game
00:16:49 that I have
00:16:50 whether I got it in a sale or for free
00:16:52 I should experience all of them
00:16:54 in my library.
00:16:55 I should you know
00:16:56 watch all of these movies
00:16:57 that I've been meaning to watch
00:16:59 all these TV shows
00:17:00 and I found that it's just like
00:17:02 it's just stressful thinking
00:17:04 that I have to do that.
00:17:05 100%.
00:17:06 Like I would much rather
00:17:08 not give a shit
00:17:09 and then be like
00:17:10 oh yeah I'd never seen
00:17:11 like Die Hard.
00:17:12 I still haven't seen Die Hard
00:17:13 and I'd be like
00:17:14 oh what the fuck
00:17:15 you'd never seen that
00:17:16 and I'd be like yeah
00:17:17 what are you going to do?
00:17:18 You want to fight about it
00:17:19 or kill you?
00:17:20 Kill me?
00:17:21 100%
00:17:22 because that's another project
00:17:23 that you'll have in your mind
00:17:24 you'll get more and more
00:17:25 an option overload
00:17:27 you'll get more and more things
00:17:28 like oh gotta do this
00:17:29 and I gotta do this
00:17:30 and I gotta do this
00:17:31 and we'll just clutter up your mind
00:17:32 you really gotta reduce
00:17:33 as much clutter in your brain as possible.
00:17:34 You know what I think is the
00:17:35 the issue with that
00:17:36 I think we all as human beings
00:17:37 we perceive the world as though
00:17:39 we're immortal
00:17:40 we really from like
00:17:41 as soon as possible
00:17:42 should start to rationalize
00:17:43 like okay I'm going to live for 80 years
00:17:45 like did you did in that one big
00:17:47 vlog where he broke down
00:17:48 like I've got like 80 years to live
00:17:50 I want to consume like
00:17:51 every anime ever made
00:17:52 I've got this much time
00:17:53 I'm going to sleep for this many hours
00:17:55 I've got exactly this many hours
00:17:56 to like work
00:17:57 and this may to enjoy media
00:17:59 like what am I going to
00:18:00 slot into that time
00:18:02 makes a lot of sense to do things that way
00:18:03 sounds like the worst possible way to live
00:18:06 I mean maybe, maybe
00:18:08 it seems to work for him
00:18:10 specifically with his career
00:18:12 and the fact that he just does
00:18:13 like watching anime a lot
00:18:16 but like for me
00:18:17 I guess when people give you money
00:18:20 for watching anime
00:18:21 yeah it makes perfect sense to do
00:18:23 80 years watching anime
00:18:25 I could technically
00:18:26 I mean get paid to do
00:18:29 like to experience media
00:18:30 and then tell you about it
00:18:31 it's just that I got bored of that
00:18:33 and I stopped
00:18:34 you know
00:18:35 like it's something that I'm not
00:18:37 as into
00:18:38 I think most people will eventually
00:18:39 and like it just
00:18:41 it weighs on my mind this idea that
00:18:43 I don't know
00:18:44 I should get around to certain things
00:18:46 because so much of what I do consume
00:18:48 is people telling me about
00:18:49 video games that are good
00:18:50 let me tell you
00:18:51 you don't have to worry about all that
00:18:53 because anything you're thinking about consuming
00:18:55 is nothing but a trick
00:18:58 is nothing but a lie
00:18:59 placed before you
00:19:00 by the capitalist hierarchy
00:19:02 in order to siphon power away from you
00:19:04 and towards them
00:19:05 don't trust any of it
00:19:06 oh my god
00:19:07 what about this copy of Das Kapital
00:19:09 especially Das Kapital
00:19:11 yeah
00:19:12 no
00:19:13 unironically agree
00:19:14 I feel constant guilt
00:19:16 every time that I consume
00:19:17 any piece of media
00:19:19 because like
00:19:20 I've consumed enough fucking media
00:19:23 I've seen everything
00:19:24 I've read everything
00:19:25 I should be
00:19:26 instead of
00:19:27 continuing to watch movies
00:19:29 and read comics and shit
00:19:30 should I not be like
00:19:31 in Budapest right now
00:19:33 or like seeing something for myself
00:19:35 you know
00:19:36 traveling the world on camelback
00:19:38 yeah
00:19:39 no I feel ya
00:19:40 as opposed to like playing the new JRPG
00:19:42 which I feel
00:19:43 probably would get a lot more out of like
00:19:44 I don't know
00:19:45 visiting Myanmar
00:19:47 visiting China
00:19:48 seeing
00:19:49 I don't know India
00:19:50 probably you know
00:19:51 but of course
00:19:52 but you don't have
00:19:53 but you don't
00:19:54 but you can't have the freedom
00:19:55 to do cool stuff like that
00:19:56 because you've got loved ones
00:19:57 who go
00:19:58 where'd you go
00:19:59 why aren't you with me
00:20:00 this
00:20:01 so you know
00:20:02 all you can do is just
00:20:03 waste your fucking life
00:20:04 continuing to consume media
00:20:05 and wishing you were other places
00:20:07 god I hate my loved ones
00:20:09 you know
00:20:10 it's the ultimate trap of capitalism
00:20:11 having loved ones
00:20:13 I agree
00:20:14 Tom Tom
00:20:15 hey
00:20:16 travel's never done anything for me
00:20:17 with all these things
00:20:18 you gotta look at
00:20:19 your own personal
00:20:20 sort of situation
00:20:21 that you're in
00:20:22 like for me
00:20:23 I think we talked about this
00:20:24 on an old PCP a while ago
00:20:25 but I
00:20:26 only
00:20:27 I built a very tall empire
00:20:28 I didn't really branch out
00:20:29 of the few
00:20:30 stories and movies that I had
00:20:31 and I basically just
00:20:32 watched them over and over
00:20:33 so I'm pretty
00:20:34 immediate illiterate
00:20:35 and so I feel like
00:20:36 you know
00:20:37 I can't really travel
00:20:38 anymore than I already have
00:20:39 I've already
00:20:40 went on this giant fucking
00:20:41 globe-trying adventure
00:20:42 last month
00:20:43 for 30 days
00:20:44 where I raced across
00:20:45 and over and over again
00:20:46 but you know
00:20:47 I can't do that anymore
00:20:48 and I'm gonna be in college
00:20:49 for a while
00:20:50 I'm just gonna buckle down
00:20:51 with some movies
00:20:52 because I only watch
00:20:53 YouTube videos
00:20:54 that's not good
00:20:55 I'm gonna get something
00:20:56 I'm gonna get something else
00:20:57 in my body
00:20:58 there's definitely
00:20:59 what you do specifically
00:21:00 there's definitely like
00:21:01 a trap
00:21:02 that I fall into a lot
00:21:03 which is like
00:21:04 all or nothing
00:21:05 for a thing
00:21:06 like
00:21:07 ah man
00:21:08 media sucks
00:21:09 I should do everything
00:21:10 other than media
00:21:11 like it has to be
00:21:12 all good or all bad
00:21:13 so whatever is bad
00:21:14 it's all good
00:21:15 but traveling is often
00:21:16 really annoying
00:21:17 and when you get to a place
00:21:18 unless the view is nice
00:21:19 unless it's actually
00:21:20 a nice place
00:21:21 it's just the same
00:21:22 as where you were
00:21:23 there's a pavement
00:21:24 there's a car
00:21:25 there's a guy
00:21:26 maybe he speaks in gibberish
00:21:27 but you know
00:21:28 it's just
00:21:29 it's mostly the same
00:21:30 some nonsense gobbledygook
00:21:31 because humans have like
00:21:32 you know
00:21:33 they've made the world
00:21:34 the same place
00:21:35 basically
00:21:36 it's habitable
00:21:37 you'll survive
00:21:38 you're talking about
00:21:39 traveling right now
00:21:40 traveling yeah
00:21:41 like
00:21:42 like the thing
00:21:43 that the reason
00:21:44 the video series
00:21:45 about the guy
00:21:46 walking in a straight line
00:21:47 across Wales
00:21:48 is so interesting
00:21:49 is because
00:21:50 he is like
00:21:51 I thought you meant like
00:21:52 Wales
00:21:53 yeah yeah
00:21:54 it's like the same word
00:21:55 or something
00:21:56 it must be tough to like
00:21:57 get the Wales to like
00:21:58 form a straight line
00:21:59 oh my god
00:22:00 it is
00:22:01 that's my favourite part
00:22:02 um
00:22:03 that's literally what
00:22:04 I thought you were talking
00:22:05 about before
00:22:06 I just didn't say anything
00:22:07 cause I thought
00:22:08 I thought like
00:22:09 everyone knew about it
00:22:10 and I'd be the only one
00:22:11 like ah this guy doesn't know
00:22:12 about the dude walking
00:22:13 across Wales
00:22:14 what a fucking dummy
00:22:15 the thing that's so great
00:22:17 about it is because
00:22:18 it's in a straight line
00:22:19 he has a little GPS thing
00:22:20 he has to go through
00:22:21 people's property
00:22:22 and he has to
00:22:23 sneak past
00:22:24 farmers
00:22:25 and their houses
00:22:26 and he has to like
00:22:27 um
00:22:28 you know
00:22:29 constantly be on the lookout
00:22:30 if there's like
00:22:31 a cold river
00:22:32 there's like
00:22:33 a raging torrent
00:22:34 he has to cross
00:22:35 and it's like
00:22:36 he has to like
00:22:37 make a decision
00:22:38 whether to cross
00:22:39 this very very dangerous
00:22:40 river
00:22:41 or like
00:22:42 deviate like
00:22:43 20 meters from his path
00:22:44 and go around
00:22:45 20 meters
00:22:46 and go
00:22:47 go around to a rickety bridge
00:22:48 and it's like
00:22:49 it's
00:22:50 it's
00:22:51 turning this
00:22:52 it's turning
00:22:53 the world that we live in
00:22:54 which is very
00:22:55 you know
00:22:56 um
00:22:57 it's all chopped up
00:22:58 and all like
00:22:59 managed and
00:23:00 sorted out
00:23:01 and there's paths everywhere
00:23:02 and there's road signs
00:23:03 everywhere
00:23:04 and you'll never be
00:23:05 perfectly alone ever
00:23:06 and he just
00:23:07 bucks the trend
00:23:08 by smashing through
00:23:09 all the boundaries
00:23:10 that we've put up for ourselves
00:23:11 all these fences
00:23:12 and barbed wire
00:23:13 and it's such
00:23:14 it's like a real adventure
00:23:15 even though
00:23:16 um
00:23:17 Wales is a very small country
00:23:18 and he's going not that
00:23:19 very far
00:23:20 but it just feels so epic
00:23:21 because it's
00:23:22 it's a
00:23:23 it's an aspect of travel that
00:23:25 you know
00:23:26 you would never
00:23:27 you would never bother
00:23:28 to like go over a fence
00:23:29 when there's like
00:23:30 a fence gate
00:23:31 like a couple meters
00:23:32 down the road
00:23:33 that's the genre
00:23:34 of human madness
00:23:35 that I can respect
00:23:37 I agree
00:23:38 I mean
00:23:39 I love
00:23:40 I love the straight line
00:23:41 Wales guy
00:23:42 as much as another person
00:23:43 I've
00:23:44 I've watched
00:23:45 like every video
00:23:46 like on repeat
00:23:47 for like every night
00:23:48 for the past
00:23:49 like two weeks
00:23:50 that's like my one
00:23:51 that's my one YouTube
00:23:52 that I watch exclusively
00:23:53 basically
00:23:54 it's great
00:23:55 but I will say
00:23:56 that I completely
00:23:57 disagree with like
00:23:58 everything is like
00:23:59 the same
00:24:00 I know you're
00:24:01 saying exactly the same
00:24:02 but like
00:24:03 it's even the pavement
00:24:04 even just the buildings
00:24:05 yeah
00:24:06 they are buildings
00:24:07 yeah there's hospitals
00:24:08 everywhere
00:24:09 but even that
00:24:10 there's so many different
00:24:11 unique things
00:24:12 all right
00:24:13 sure
00:24:14 what I meant by that
00:24:15 not that everything's the same
00:24:16 like you go to India
00:24:17 and it's like
00:24:18 I could have done this
00:24:19 at home
00:24:20 like you obviously couldn't
00:24:21 there's definitely things
00:24:22 to see in the world
00:24:24 but you don't
00:24:25 like seeing things in the world
00:24:26 doesn't take very long
00:24:27 and if you stay
00:24:28 in a place for like
00:24:29 more than two weeks
00:24:30 you're like yeah I get it
00:24:31 like
00:24:32 I disagree
00:24:33 the reason to stay
00:24:34 in a place
00:24:35 is not just to be
00:24:36 in a place
00:24:37 in the place
00:24:38 I mean that's
00:24:39 maybe you took that
00:24:40 as like part of it
00:24:41 but a lot of the time
00:24:42 travel doesn't include that
00:24:43 because I don't know
00:24:45 people in the world
00:24:46 and I'm like
00:24:47 I can't talk to strangers
00:24:48 but like
00:24:49 if an opportunity arises
00:24:50 where I could go
00:24:51 meet somebody
00:24:52 in a different country
00:24:53 that would be
00:24:54 way cooler
00:24:55 a lot of the reason
00:24:57 I agree
00:24:58 is because I like to
00:24:59 explore the place
00:25:00 I mean it's all about
00:25:01 the place for me really
00:25:02 I mean I just like
00:25:03 well surely the culture
00:25:04 of the people
00:25:05 like I'd like to see
00:25:06 this built by
00:25:07 the gaps and
00:25:08 yeah
00:25:09 well I mean
00:25:10 it's all tied together
00:25:11 we all have different
00:25:12 acclimation times
00:25:13 you know like
00:25:14 some people like
00:25:15 be in a space for like
00:25:16 an hour
00:25:17 they're like
00:25:18 I get it
00:25:19 whatever I'm used to it
00:25:20 other people can take
00:25:21 weeks to really
00:25:22 getting gross
00:25:23 and like the subtle
00:25:24 differences
00:25:25 it really depends
00:25:26 on the person
00:25:27 what I love
00:25:28 going to a new city for
00:25:29 is I love
00:25:30 getting all in the nooks
00:25:31 and cranes
00:25:32 and all the dense
00:25:33 parts of it
00:25:34 and all the local places
00:25:35 that I know
00:25:36 and we're all in a big
00:25:37 unbroken series
00:25:38 of dominoes
00:25:39 falling
00:25:40 oh my god
00:25:41 I'm obsesion of the world
00:25:42 I exclaim
00:25:43 like every three seconds
00:25:44 living in Boston
00:25:45 I'm with you
00:25:46 and it's great
00:25:47 I mean definitely
00:25:49 I get that
00:25:50 I've just never
00:25:51 never found that like
00:25:52 compelling
00:25:53 it's not that I don't
00:25:54 it's kind of interesting
00:25:55 like oh yeah
00:25:56 and then I just
00:25:57 don't give a shit
00:25:58 and I go back to watching
00:25:59 I definitely feel that
00:26:00 sometimes
00:26:01 but like
00:26:02 I don't know
00:26:03 I've been to quite a few
00:26:04 places
00:26:05 it's nice
00:26:06 but like
00:26:07 I guess I just
00:26:08 never feel comfortable
00:26:09 enough
00:26:10 like I always feel like
00:26:11 like home bases
00:26:12 like home
00:26:13 home
00:26:14 and I can't really like
00:26:15 relax
00:26:16 and
00:26:17 like I like exploring
00:26:18 but only for like a day
00:26:19 or two
00:26:20 and then I'm like
00:26:22 it becomes a chore
00:26:24 it becomes like
00:26:25 there's so many places
00:26:26 to see
00:26:27 that seeing all of them
00:26:28 is impossible
00:26:29 and so I have to like
00:26:30 map out like the perfect
00:26:31 places
00:26:32 or maybe hire
00:26:33 a tour guide
00:26:34 and I'm like
00:26:35 I don't care about fucking tours
00:26:36 even though they're probably great
00:26:37 I just hate the idea
00:26:38 of paying someone
00:26:39 to just walk me around
00:26:40 when I could do that myself
00:26:41 like when I was in Japan
00:26:43 basically the most
00:26:44 interesting places I went
00:26:45 like I walked around the city
00:26:46 plenty
00:26:47 and since I like
00:26:48 wasn't with people I knew
00:26:49 I didn't really know
00:26:50 the sites to go to
00:26:51 it's like you're just
00:26:52 walking by like
00:26:53 a bunch of closed doors
00:26:54 and you're like
00:26:55 not talking to anyone
00:26:56 you're not engaging
00:26:57 but when I had guides
00:26:58 like for example
00:26:59 one person I met
00:27:00 was like a native
00:27:01 a Japanese dude
00:27:02 I was in my little friend group
00:27:03 while I was there
00:27:04 and he like
00:27:05 knew Kamiket
00:27:06 and he took
00:27:07 which I don't know
00:27:08 if you guys know
00:27:09 like did you
00:27:10 it's like the biggest
00:27:11 yeah it's the biggest
00:27:12 dojin thing in the world
00:27:13 in this big famous
00:27:14 place in Tokyo
00:27:15 like he was our guide
00:27:16 and he's like
00:27:17 oh you guys want to go
00:27:18 I will be your guide
00:27:19 and he helped us
00:27:20 get to Kamiket
00:27:21 I went there
00:27:22 had a great time
00:27:23 and like
00:27:24 I wouldn't have known how
00:27:25 or like
00:27:26 why to do that
00:27:27 if I didn't have a guy
00:27:28 or like
00:27:29 when I went to
00:27:30 Mount
00:27:31 with the Kuro Tamago
00:27:32 the black eggs
00:27:33 on these hot springs
00:27:34 on a mountain side
00:27:35 which was like
00:27:36 the highlight
00:27:37 it was like
00:27:38 the naturalistic highlight
00:27:39 of going to the place
00:27:40 which is just this amazing
00:27:41 hot spring covered mountain
00:27:43 obviously because
00:27:44 there's volcanic activity
00:27:45 underneath it
00:27:46 where they just
00:27:47 hard boil eggs
00:27:48 and they turn black
00:27:49 from the sulfur
00:27:50 and it was like
00:27:51 a magic religious experience
00:27:52 it was so fucking cool
00:27:53 but it's only because
00:27:54 I had a guide
00:27:55 who like knew the area
00:27:56 I was able to like
00:27:57 even know this place
00:27:58 existed
00:27:59 let alone get there
00:28:00 but that's amazing
00:28:01 that's the sort of like
00:28:02 that's the sort of stuff
00:28:03 I live for
00:28:04 just being able to
00:28:05 get on something local
00:28:06 and get and just
00:28:07 really experience
00:28:08 what kind of people do
00:28:09 in other places
00:28:10 just like
00:28:11 and this isn't just like
00:28:12 for a broad thing
00:28:13 I feel this in America too
00:28:14 I mean I was just going up
00:28:15 and down California
00:28:16 and even though
00:28:17 you know
00:28:18 America's very homogenous
00:28:19 in a lot of
00:28:20 a lot of
00:28:21 a lot of ways
00:28:22 just going to different towns
00:28:23 like for instance San Francisco
00:28:24 one big thing about there
00:28:25 super vertical
00:28:26 it's not like a adventure too
00:28:27 it's real life
00:28:28 and it was
00:28:29 it was just like man
00:28:30 it's so different here
00:28:31 and over there
00:28:32 here's a really historic pier
00:28:34 oh my god
00:28:35 it's existed for a billion years
00:28:36 look at those seals over there
00:28:37 I'm in raptured
00:28:39 in euphoria right now
00:28:40 like it's like
00:28:41 I have no like
00:28:43 reservations about
00:28:44 feeling not at home
00:28:46 I like just
00:28:47 like immediately
00:28:48 wherever I am
00:28:49 I sink into just a sense of
00:28:50 I want to know everything
00:28:51 like what's the temperature like here
00:28:52 is it a little bit different
00:28:53 it's a little bit of humidity here
00:28:54 look at these buildings
00:28:55 they're like a different
00:28:56 architectural style
00:28:57 than I've seen before
00:28:58 and it's just
00:28:59 it's just a constant stream
00:29:00 of just joy
00:29:01 whenever I travel anywhere
00:29:03 just constant
00:29:04 I know what you mean
00:29:05 you're saying all the right things buddy
00:29:07 I remember when I was in Rome
00:29:09 I was with my family
00:29:10 and you know
00:29:11 I loved them dearly
00:29:12 and we did all the coliseum
00:29:13 all those sort of tour stuff
00:29:14 but my favorite parts
00:29:15 were just walking around the city
00:29:16 because they were just
00:29:17 a bunch of beautiful
00:29:18 bridges we could go over
00:29:19 or really just I did
00:29:20 because I was walking alone
00:29:21 and I would sketch things
00:29:22 in my sketchbook
00:29:23 and I would talk to the people
00:29:24 I must have done this
00:29:25 on the PCP before
00:29:27 somewhere
00:29:28 but on the last day
00:29:29 we had Mr.
00:29:30 we had Mr.
00:29:31 and we were had
00:29:32 an extra day in Rome
00:29:33 that I could spend in
00:29:34 and I was sketching
00:29:35 the alter patriotism
00:29:36 which I've talked about
00:29:37 many times before
00:29:38 because it's got a kick-ass funny name
00:29:39 and there's this
00:29:40 there's this like Muslim girl
00:29:41 next to me
00:29:42 who was in hijab
00:29:43 and she was like
00:29:44 oh you draw an anime
00:29:45 I was like
00:29:46 yeah
00:29:47 and then we talked about anime
00:29:48 for a little bit
00:29:49 how she's going to become a manga artist
00:29:50 oh wait
00:29:51 where was this
00:29:52 this was in Rome
00:29:53 this was in Italy
00:29:54 I was sketching
00:29:55 like a big monument
00:29:56 and then we had a nice little conversation
00:29:57 and then she had to go with her dad
00:29:58 and I said goodbye
00:29:59 and it was great
00:30:00 it's just great talking to people
00:30:01 just strangers
00:30:02 yeah man
00:30:03 that's like the
00:30:04 that's awesome
00:30:05 I have a story
00:30:06 when I was teaching
00:30:07 physics in Poland
00:30:08 all my students
00:30:09 were
00:30:10 they were all from Saudi Arabia
00:30:11 and
00:30:12 one day I come into the classroom
00:30:14 late
00:30:15 as I often did
00:30:16 Lamal
00:30:17 and
00:30:18 they're like doodling
00:30:19 on the
00:30:20 whiteboard
00:30:21 and one of them
00:30:22 one of like the most
00:30:23 talkative ones
00:30:24 who I like
00:30:25 I talk to the most
00:30:26 he's like doodling on the white
00:30:27 and he's drawing like
00:30:28 an anime girl
00:30:29 he's drawing like an anime
00:30:30 and I'm like
00:30:31 hey
00:30:32 I think like after class
00:30:33 I like talk to him about anime
00:30:34 or something a little bit
00:30:35 like I asked him like
00:30:36 I don't even remember
00:30:37 what we were talking about
00:30:38 but it came up
00:30:39 and he was like
00:30:40 yeah
00:30:41 yeah I love anime
00:30:42 but you know
00:30:43 we're not technically allowed to watch it
00:30:44 because the king
00:30:45 fucking banned it or whatever
00:30:46 and I'm like
00:30:47 what the fuck
00:30:48 are you fucking kidding me
00:30:49 it is subversive
00:30:50 it should be banned
00:30:51 yeah our literal king
00:30:52 we
00:30:53 from a country
00:30:54 king
00:30:55 just decreed that like
00:30:56 yeah no anime
00:30:57 I mean Gibbs got one of those
00:30:58 almost
00:30:59 yeah I don't think it's the same thing
00:31:00 it's different though yeah
00:31:01 I forget if it was Iraq
00:31:02 or Iran
00:31:03 but in one of those countries
00:31:04 music was banned
00:31:05 for a little while
00:31:06 like just music
00:31:07 oh my god
00:31:08 that can't be true
00:31:09 that can't be right
00:31:10 I've seen
00:31:11 I've seen Footloose
00:31:12 actually I haven't
00:31:13 the true story of
00:31:16 I don't know
00:31:17 the Arab Emirates
00:31:18 or whatever
00:31:19 yeah I think so
00:31:20 I think so
00:31:22 well
00:31:23 they got jet packs over there though
00:31:24 that's pretty sick
00:31:25 what have we learned
00:31:26 anime is universal
00:31:27 and brings people together
00:31:28 across cultures
00:31:29 it literally does
00:31:30 it literally does
00:31:31 well
00:31:32 and like media
00:31:33 so we must destroy it
00:31:34 like media with
00:31:35 universal human values
00:31:36 brings human beings together
00:31:37 what a shock
00:31:38 imagine that
00:31:39 just like my favorite movie
00:31:40 7
00:31:41 by David Fincher
00:31:42 Brad Pitt
00:31:43 fucking goes the shit out of that guy
00:31:45 get the whole thing
00:31:46 it's all just been
00:31:47 secretly the movie topic
00:31:51 oh hey hey
00:31:52 it's not a left turn
00:31:53 of a little bit of a story

00:32:37 I call a locksmith
00:32:38 I Google locksmith in Cincinnati
00:32:40 and luckily
00:32:41 I don't know if you guys are aware
00:32:42 there was a thriving
00:32:43 extremely competitive industry
00:32:46 of locksmiths
00:32:47 for exactly people
00:32:48 in this situation
00:32:49 and these people
00:32:50 a lot of dumb people in America
00:32:51 a lot of dumb asshole retards
00:32:53 such as myself who locked themselves
00:32:55 out of their house
00:32:56 and every possible check and balance
00:32:58 gets fucked up
00:32:59 so I just call the very first one
00:33:01 and I'm like hey can you come
00:33:02 like pick my lock
00:33:03 and let me into my house
00:33:04 and they're like
00:33:05 yeah we'll be there in like an hour or two
00:33:07 got another appointment
00:33:08 so here I am
00:33:09 dump de dump de dump
00:33:10 waiting for this guy to show up
00:33:12 and by the way
00:33:13 this this doop de doop
00:33:14 there's no payoff to this
00:33:15 to this bit I'm doing
00:33:16 that's just not just happening
00:33:19 so whatever
00:33:20 like Michelle comes home
00:33:21 we're just waiting for the guy
00:33:22 to show up
00:33:23 so whatever
00:33:24 he just picks the lock
00:33:25 he gets in
00:33:26 it's effortless
00:33:27 this man is definitely a criminal
00:33:28 these people have way too much power
00:33:30 and you know I wasn't thinking
00:33:31 about this at the time
00:33:32 but when like the locksmith shows up
00:33:34 Michelle's just kind of
00:33:35 sitting in the entrance way
00:33:36 inside
00:33:37 and the guy goes in
00:33:38 and like he picks it
00:33:39 he goes inside
00:33:40 Michelle had like gone into the bedroom
00:33:41 which I thought was a little bit rude
00:33:43 I was like don't you want to like
00:33:44 thank the guy
00:33:45 and then afterward I'm like
00:33:46 hey you know that guy was here
00:33:47 I didn't want him to see me
00:33:48 because I don't trust locksmith
00:33:50 they have too much power
00:33:51 he could do
00:33:52 he could do anything
00:33:53 he could do anything to this place
00:33:55 he could know where I live
00:33:56 and that's totally fair
00:33:58 that's totally fair
00:33:59 he was a good guy
00:34:00 but I don't trust anyone in the world
00:34:02 that reminds me of him
00:34:04 who are you
00:34:05 and how'd you get in here
00:34:06 I'm a locksmith
00:34:07 and I'm a locksmith
00:34:10 is that Leslie Nielsen
00:34:11 yeah
00:34:12 yeah
00:34:13 that's a good one
00:34:14 I had a
00:34:15 when I rented a car
00:34:16 I moved my stuff
00:34:17 from Georgia Boston
00:34:19 I called a
00:34:20 I locked myself out of the rental car
00:34:22 and I called a guy
00:34:23 and the guy just had these fucking
00:34:24 he had a thing that he just inserted
00:34:26 into like the
00:34:27 the side
00:34:28 like the gap between the doors
00:34:30 and he just inflated it
00:34:31 and like the balloon pressure
00:34:33 just like squeeze the door open
00:34:35 like bent the door enough
00:34:36 that he could slide like a
00:34:38 what do you call it
00:34:39 like a fucking like wire thing
00:34:40 and like blow the lock up
00:34:41 like this guy can just get into
00:34:42 literally any car
00:34:43 you know
00:34:44 I had a tool
00:34:45 I could have easily gotten into this
00:34:47 but by the way
00:34:48 like while we were talking
00:34:49 he just one of the things
00:34:50 he asked me was like
00:34:51 hey so are you a student
00:34:52 I guess I look youthful
00:34:53 oh thanks for saying so
00:34:54 I just
00:34:55 I'm like no no
00:34:56 I actually
00:34:57 I came out here
00:34:58 working with like a
00:34:59 there was like a program
00:35:00 he asked you because you looked dumb
00:35:01 and he thought you needed
00:35:02 to learn a thing or two
00:35:03 yeah that's probably
00:35:04 he's looking for an apprentice
00:35:06 I just had
00:35:07 no I mean I was
00:35:08 I was a computer programmer
00:35:09 but I actually just quit
00:35:10 the other day
00:35:11 and now I'm a YouTuber
00:35:13 okay
00:35:14 what did he say to this
00:35:15 I mean
00:35:16 I answered his question
00:35:17 he didn't know before that point
00:35:18 that a stranger
00:35:19 could be disappointed
00:35:20 well he just
00:35:22 like as he was leaving
00:35:23 he was like oh yeah that's
00:35:24 interesting and then as he was
00:35:25 leaving he's like hey man
00:35:26 like where do I
00:35:27 where do I look you up
00:35:28 and I was like oh well
00:35:29 I'm best guy ever
00:35:30 on YouTube you can
00:35:31 and but then I realized
00:35:32 what am I doing right now
00:35:33 I'm like giving this guy
00:35:34 like if this man wanted to
00:35:36 he knows where I live
00:35:38 and he knows what I do
00:35:39 you just doxed yourself
00:35:40 I guess I doxed myself
00:35:42 to this one man
00:35:43 I probably just shouldn't have
00:35:45 to anyone else
00:35:46 it would have been fine
00:35:47 but to a locksmith
00:35:48 to a locksmith specifically
00:35:50 like what if this guy
00:35:51 is a crazy obsessed fanboy
00:35:53 or just like maybe
00:35:54 maybe he hates me
00:35:55 maybe he hates me
00:35:56 stop stop
00:35:57 stop right now
00:35:58 you think your locksmith
00:35:59 is going to go to your channel
00:36:01 like oh best guy ever
00:36:02 that guy from early on
00:36:03 let me look him up right here
00:36:04 have you seen
00:36:05 have you seen
00:36:07 my favorite shows dude

00:36:13 no we gotta
00:36:14 we gotta fast forward
00:36:15 fast forward three weeks
00:36:16 in Nate's life
00:36:17 he's just
00:36:18 he's just sleeping
00:36:19 soundly
00:36:20 and here's a rattle at the door
00:36:21 and all of a sudden
00:36:22 he turns over
00:36:23 he goes back to bed
00:36:24 that couldn't be anything
00:36:25 and all of a sudden
00:36:26 there's his eyes
00:36:27 staring at him
00:36:28 he's just like
00:36:29 you fucking asshole
00:36:30 where the fuck is best anime ever
00:36:31 goes to the shell, Nate
00:36:34 you fucking assholes are acting like
00:36:36 this is such a crazy thing
00:36:37 to be concerned about
00:36:38 literally having like
00:36:39 a public platform
00:36:41 and you know
00:36:42 telling people about it
00:36:43 and like telling them
00:36:44 how to break into your fucking house
00:36:46 that one person in the world
00:36:47 knows where you live
00:36:48 and that you have a YouTube channel
00:36:50 it's funny that the person
00:36:51 who's the most worried about it
00:36:52 is the one who doxxed himself
00:36:53 and we're all just like
00:36:54 yeah whatever
00:36:55 I never make a mistake
00:36:56 now I know
00:36:57 now I fucking know
00:36:58 it probably
00:36:59 god damn it
00:37:00 you people are assholes
00:37:01 shut up shut up to the locksmith
00:37:02 watching this episode right now
00:37:04 thanks for the story dude
00:37:05 no I'm with you
00:37:06 I understand
00:37:07 okay thank you
00:37:08 because like absolutely
00:37:09 nobody in the real world
00:37:10 knows anything about what I do
00:37:12 and that's the way
00:37:13 it's going to stay forever
00:37:14 that's mine
00:37:15 nobody in my family
00:37:16 they all think that like
00:37:18 I don't know that I
00:37:20 what do you do I'm not like
00:37:22 no one
00:37:23 I don't associate with people
00:37:24 who understand what YouTube is
00:37:26 that's the way that I keep
00:37:27 my life right
00:37:28 I do not associate with
00:37:29 the YouTubers
00:37:30 yeah I'm with you
00:37:31 everyone in real life
00:37:32 thinks I'm a failure
00:37:33 and they're not far off
00:37:34 what the fuck is that
00:37:35 are you not aware of that
00:37:37 I think it was originally a vine
00:37:38 that was an Indian boy
00:37:39 using an impolite word
00:37:40 for the African American community
00:37:42 saying
00:37:43 I do not associate with
00:37:45 you know
00:37:46 and then he said a bad word
00:37:47 but it was really funny
00:37:48 you know
00:37:49 both of you guys
00:37:50 Nate and Ben
00:37:51 yeah
00:37:52 maybe this is
00:37:53 maybe this is like
00:37:54 a cultural thing
00:37:55 or a class thing
00:37:56 but that's the first time
00:37:57 I've ever heard a
00:37:58 locked myself
00:37:59 out of my something
00:38:00 story
00:38:01 that ended with
00:38:02 I called the locksmith
00:38:03 and not
00:38:04 I smashed my own fucking window
00:38:05 and broke my own fucking door
00:38:06 down
00:38:07 and threw a fit
00:38:08 because that's how
00:38:09 we handle those situations
00:38:10 in my world
00:38:11 it crossed my mind
00:38:12 it crossed my mind
00:38:13 but like
00:38:14 my apartment's weird
00:38:15 it's on like a second floor
00:38:16 I did not know that
00:38:17 locksmiths were a people
00:38:18 that you could call
00:38:19 in such a situation
00:38:20 well well
00:38:21 okay maybe I should have
00:38:22 because this fucking fee
00:38:23 this is a hundred and fifty
00:38:24 dollars
00:38:25 what the fuck
00:38:26 what
00:38:27 yeah
00:38:28 so I was right all along
00:38:29 I didn't call a locksmith
00:38:30 I called
00:38:31 well I called AAA
00:38:32 okay AAA
00:38:33 it was my call
00:38:34 Nate you should have done
00:38:35 you should have just gone
00:38:36 to Udemy.com
00:38:37 spent fifteen dollars
00:38:38 taught yourself how to
00:38:39 pick locks
00:38:40 and then be good to go
00:38:41 I okay
00:38:42 let's not act like
00:38:43 I didn't spend a twenty
00:38:44 minutes on YouTube
00:38:45 trying to find techniques
00:38:46 to pick my own lock
00:38:47 alright
00:38:48 cause I did
00:38:49 they just didn't work
00:38:50 or I didn't
00:38:51 could you
00:38:52 my dog was inside
00:38:53 and it was getting close
00:38:54 to midnight
00:38:55 and it was his birthday
00:38:56 it was his birthday
00:38:57 in like one hour
00:38:58 I had to say
00:38:59 happy birthday
00:39:00 I couldn't wait
00:39:01 please it's my dog's
00:39:02 birthday
00:39:03 he's fair
00:39:04 okay
00:39:05 the house that I live in
00:39:06 right now
00:39:07 when I moved in
00:39:08 my friend John
00:39:09 he gave me a key
00:39:10 but I lost it somewhere
00:39:11 and I was like
00:39:12 well shit I don't have a key
00:39:13 but I realized that
00:39:14 like our door sucks
00:39:15 and I can literally
00:39:16 just like Jimmy
00:39:17 the outdoor lock
00:39:18 with a credit card
00:39:19 and so for like
00:39:20 months and months
00:39:21 my key to my house
00:39:22 was just a credit card
00:39:23 that I would jam into the
00:39:24 doorway
00:39:25 and open the lock
00:39:26 worked easy
00:39:27 every time
00:39:28 Nate called a locksmith
00:39:29 he's like
00:39:30 I gotta get him
00:39:31 it's my dog's birthday
00:39:32 and he's like
00:39:33 oh Lord Shoshesh
00:39:34 this guy ever
00:39:35 is that you
00:39:36 I've been following you for years
00:39:37 look around
00:39:38 no that's
00:39:39 he just
00:39:40 he just casually says
00:39:41 Seshio
00:39:42 he's like I didn't tell you
00:39:43 my dog's name is Seshio
00:39:46 oh shit
00:39:47 I remember
00:39:48 the room I'm in
00:39:49 you could have looked up
00:39:50 like how expensive
00:39:51 it would have been
00:39:52 to replace the window
00:39:53 rather than
00:39:54 to hire a locksmith
00:39:55 it may have been cheaper
00:39:56 you call the locksmith
00:39:57 you tell him what's up
00:39:58 you say
00:39:59 all that happens
00:40:00 he says oh Lord Seshio
00:40:01 you say
00:40:02 I didn't tell you my dog's name
00:40:03 so I know
00:40:04 I already let myself in
00:40:05 and you
00:40:06 and he slowly opens the door
00:40:07 and you look inside
00:40:08 and the locksmith is in there
00:40:09 him and Seshio
00:40:10 both wearing
00:40:11 he's wearing your clothes
00:40:12 he's with Michelle
00:40:17 you know what
00:40:18 he's better than me
00:40:19 he knows how to pick locks
00:40:20 and I don't
00:40:21 the room I'm in right now
00:40:22 I was locked out
00:40:23 of mere months ago
00:40:24 I'm in
00:40:25 Kazzy's dad's bedroom
00:40:26 right now
00:40:29 and so
00:40:30 we got locked out
00:40:31 me and Kazzy
00:40:32 and a peculiar thing about this
00:40:34 is that there's a balcony
00:40:35 there's a balcony
00:40:36 we're on the top floor
00:40:37 so we got locked out
00:40:38 our phones are in there
00:40:39 we can't call
00:40:40 for anyone
00:40:41 her dad's out
00:40:42 I can't get to my computer
00:40:43 or my phone
00:40:44 or anything
00:40:45 so we're just
00:40:46 I'm faced with the prospect
00:40:47 of watching TV all day
00:40:48 which sounds like
00:40:49 literally worse than dying
00:40:50 so I think
00:40:51 okay
00:40:52 what am I willing to do right now
00:40:53 watch cable
00:40:54 or risk suicide
00:40:55 I think I'm going to go
00:40:56 with the suicide option
00:40:57 so I go to the top floor
00:40:58 and I'm getting ready
00:40:59 to throw myself off
00:41:00 the roof
00:41:01 and onto the balcony
00:41:02 trying to angle myself
00:41:03 so I can get in a side door
00:41:05 like a patio door
00:41:06 into my bedroom
00:41:07 and I'm like
00:41:08 I'm heave hoeing
00:41:09 I'm getting ready to do that
00:41:10 um
00:41:11 you know in Kirby 64
00:41:12 after you beat a level
00:41:13 and Kirby like heave ho
00:41:14 heave hoes
00:41:15 we're getting ready to throw
00:41:16 himself at whatever food
00:41:17 if you angle in the 64
00:41:18 correctly
00:41:19 I'm getting ready to do that
00:41:20 but eventually
00:41:21 I just look up
00:41:22 like a long enough
00:41:23 YouTube tutorial
00:41:24 where I like fully dismantled
00:41:25 the door knob
00:41:26 and it's just ease
00:41:27 outside from the socket
00:41:28 and there's
00:41:29 ease nothing there
00:41:30 like a plank of wood
00:41:31 that eases the door
00:41:32 and I just like
00:41:33 like break it open
00:41:34 and then I'm back inside
00:41:35 of my glorious
00:41:36 glorious phone
00:41:37 and then I break the cable box
00:41:38 just for good measure
00:41:40 way to go
00:41:41 yeah cool
00:41:42 so all I'm saying
00:41:43 is I didn't have to have
00:41:44 a locksmith's worry about
00:41:45 you know
00:41:46 learning about park road
00:41:47 dude 91
00:41:48 or spirit silence
00:41:49 and you know
00:41:50 trying to take in my identity
00:41:52 smart move
00:41:53 smart move
00:41:55 you know
00:41:56 speaking about like
00:41:57 media
00:41:58 right
00:41:59 is it like
00:42:00 watching media is like
00:42:01 who cares
00:42:02 you've you've seen enough
00:42:03 or like you know
00:42:05 we could cut down
00:42:06 on the amount of media
00:42:07 but like
00:42:08 is that then
00:42:10 immoral to be
00:42:11 a person who aspires
00:42:12 to create
00:42:13 more
00:42:14 yes
00:42:15 yes definitely
00:42:16 to add to the pile
00:42:18 100%
00:42:19 yeah
00:42:20 all right
00:42:21 no I'm gonna go hard no
00:42:24 why so Nate
00:42:25 why do you think
00:42:26 that was a joke
00:42:27 I didn't hear the question
00:42:30 that was the most in tune
00:42:32 Ben and I have ever been
00:42:33 about anything
00:42:34 you said is it moral
00:42:35 to create more media
00:42:36 with more
00:42:37 yeah
00:42:38 in a world
00:42:39 where there's too much
00:42:40 distraction
00:42:41 is it immoral
00:42:42 to make
00:42:43 that's complete
00:42:44 false equivalent
00:42:45 I don't even understand
00:42:46 the question
00:42:47 I mean it's a fine question
00:42:48 I'm just throwing
00:42:49 that sort of like
00:42:50 thought into
00:42:51 I'm just throwing
00:42:52 sand
00:42:53 available
00:42:55 well actually
00:42:56 I actually like
00:42:57 the shirt
00:42:58 that has the character bio
00:42:59 of the guy who likes
00:43:00 Greg Poupon
00:43:02 and is retarded
00:43:03 I like that guy
00:43:04 the most actually
00:43:05 but okay
00:43:06 like in a world
00:43:07 where like
00:43:08 you are distracted
00:43:09 by too much for many
00:43:10 is it like a different
00:43:11 question
00:43:12 than like
00:43:13 is the amount of media
00:43:14 bad
00:43:15 yeah I mean
00:43:16 my thought process
00:43:17 would go to
00:43:18 I get the other side
00:43:19 but my thought process
00:43:20 would be like
00:43:21 this is something that
00:43:22 as the world
00:43:23 like we can't
00:43:24 we can't
00:43:25 unless we're willing to like
00:43:26 suppress the world
00:43:27 it has to be something
00:43:28 that individuals
00:43:29 like control in their
00:43:30 own lives
00:43:31 I mean maybe
00:43:32 there's a way
00:43:33 we could like limit
00:43:34 how much media people
00:43:35 are able to consume
00:43:36 and then we just give them
00:43:37 like the best and most
00:43:38 useful stuff
00:43:39 but it's gotta be
00:43:40 the individuals
00:43:41 hold on
00:43:42 okay okay
00:43:43 we mean by like
00:43:44 like what do you mean
00:43:45 by this Hippo
00:43:46 is that like
00:43:47 people watch too much
00:43:48 YouTube right
00:43:49 is that the basis
00:43:50 of this
00:43:51 like this was totally
00:43:52 like a devil's advocate
00:43:53 sort of like
00:43:54 thing
00:43:55 I don't actually
00:43:56 I would still do it myself
00:43:57 I'm not like
00:43:58 worrying about that
00:43:59 so I haven't thought about it
00:44:00 to such a degree
00:44:01 I'm just trying to think like
00:44:02 I do it
00:44:03 I do it in the first place
00:44:04 because it's immoral
00:44:05 hmm
00:44:06 that's what I like about it
00:44:07 there's no contradiction
00:44:09 of like
00:44:10 you being an artist
00:44:11 and you not consuming art
00:44:12 with like
00:44:13 every single moment
00:44:14 of your life
00:44:15 like
00:44:16 it's not a matter
00:44:17 like
00:44:18 if you're
00:44:19 if you think to yourself
00:44:20 like okay
00:44:21 listen
00:44:22 I really like media
00:44:23 but you know
00:44:24 I gotta do other things
00:44:25 like myself
00:44:26 or I gotta go to work
00:44:27 and I gotta do this
00:44:28 this and this
00:44:29 like I can't
00:44:30 like I get distracted
00:44:31 too easily by media
00:44:32 that's not you saying
00:44:33 like
00:44:34 media is bad
00:44:35 and other people
00:44:36 shouldn't like
00:44:37 like
00:44:38 what I was implying
00:44:39 okay
00:44:40 that was what it was
00:44:41 like a potential
00:44:42 like is like
00:44:43 media on the whole
00:44:44 bad for humanity
00:44:45 no
00:44:46 it appears in the human
00:44:47 condition
00:44:48 I mean that's
00:44:49 no
00:44:50 I mean
00:44:51 I totally agree
00:44:52 that too much
00:44:53 media consumption
00:44:54 is bad
00:44:55 here's the thing though
00:44:56 we have to understand
00:44:57 that the problem
00:44:58 isn't even the abundance
00:44:59 of media
00:45:00 it's the facts
00:45:01 that the vessels
00:45:02 we have to deliver us
00:45:03 these media
00:45:04 are being designed
00:45:05 like with teams
00:45:06 of psychologists
00:45:07 to get us addicted
00:45:08 yeah
00:45:09 yeah
00:45:10 okay
00:45:11 okay
00:45:12 like there's no
00:45:13 okay
00:45:14 people are gonna
00:45:15 make stuff
00:45:16 people are gonna
00:45:17 make stuff
00:45:18 and show it to each other
00:45:19 right
00:45:20 no matter what
00:45:21 there's basically
00:45:22 no point
00:45:23 I mean
00:45:24 art is fine
00:45:25 it's capitalism
00:45:26 that's bad
00:45:27 well
00:45:28 just to think
00:45:29 think of how much better
00:45:30 YouTube was before
00:45:31 it started shoving
00:45:32 recommendations
00:45:33 in your face constantly
00:45:34 it was just your subscriptions
00:45:35 it was never
00:45:36 taking over your life
00:45:37 it's not art
00:45:38 that's the problem
00:45:39 it's this
00:45:40 sort of
00:45:41 fake art
00:45:42 or fart
00:45:43 for short
00:45:44 which is
00:45:45 you know
00:45:46 created by teams
00:45:47 and corporations
00:45:48 and stuff
00:45:49 to turn you into a drum
00:45:50 think about it
00:45:51 if there were no profit motive
00:45:52 anyone
00:45:53 would anyone make
00:45:54 a like
00:45:55 fucking
00:45:56 I don't know
00:45:57 top 10
00:45:59 would people make top 10
00:46:00 list or would people make
00:46:01 whatever
00:46:02 there would be a smaller subsection
00:46:03 yeah I mean
00:46:04 did you would
00:46:05 did you would
00:46:06 they would only use people
00:46:07 like them
00:46:09 okay
00:46:10 okay okay okay
00:46:11 well
00:46:12 yeah but would there be nearly as
00:46:13 there would be like
00:46:14 one thousandth of as many
00:46:15 watch mojo would not exist
00:46:16 I mean
00:46:17 it's popularity still a thing
00:46:18 because people
00:46:19 really like them
00:46:20 a lot of people
00:46:21 really really like
00:46:22 top 10
00:46:23 yeah but nobody
00:46:24 but like
00:46:25 people don't make them
00:46:26 okay maybe did you
00:46:27 makes them
00:46:28 because he wants to make them
00:46:29 but like most people
00:46:30 don't make them
00:46:31 because they want to make them
00:46:32 I mean
00:46:33 in this scenario
00:46:34 people still want to be
00:46:35 popular
00:46:36 people still want to be
00:46:37 liked and have their video
00:46:38 right like that's
00:46:39 like we're saying
00:46:40 like there's no money
00:46:41 there's no incentive
00:46:42 but I think
00:46:43 I mean just as one example
00:46:44 popularity is the incentive
00:46:45 over money
00:46:46 so if it'll just
00:46:47 like one real life example
00:46:48 even now
00:46:49 he never got a lot of like
00:46:50 Patreon support or anything
00:46:51 but he was pretty popular
00:46:52 and had popular top 10 lists
00:46:54 so I mean
00:46:55 I assume the goal was to
00:46:56 eventually make more money
00:46:57 off of it
00:46:58 nobody's like talking about
00:46:59 Sai and how cool he is
00:47:00 or
00:47:01 well yeah
00:47:02 but they did watch his videos
00:47:03 you know they were popular
00:47:04 I mean people clicked on them
00:47:05 well his videos were
00:47:06 widely seen
00:47:07 it remains to be proven
00:47:08 whether anyone actually
00:47:09 watched them
00:47:10 well
00:47:11 okay
00:47:12 maybe just
00:47:13 you know
00:47:14 view-botted and
00:47:15 sub-botted
00:47:16 unlikely but I mean
00:47:17 people definitely saw them
00:47:18 but whatever
00:47:19 I agree
00:47:20 well why are we talking about Sai
00:47:21 I mean I feel like
00:47:22 more and more
00:47:23 like I remember
00:47:24 like you know
00:47:25 for a while Hippo
00:47:26 you were off
00:47:27 YouTube
00:47:28 and off Twitter
00:47:29 and then I'm off Twitter
00:47:30 I'm slowly getting back into it
00:47:31 and I wasn't really
00:47:32 off YouTube
00:47:33 but I'm curbing it still
00:47:34 I feel like
00:47:35 I've
00:47:36 like retained the same
00:47:37 sort of thing
00:47:38 and you probably would agree
00:47:39 that it's not like
00:47:40 any of those things are
00:47:41 inherently bad
00:47:42 like one of those things
00:47:43 is just like
00:47:44 I'm being forced to do this
00:47:46 not by like
00:47:47 an outside force
00:47:48 like with a gun in my head
00:47:49 but just like
00:47:50 like my brain
00:47:51 really wants me to do this
00:47:52 oh god
00:47:53 oh well I have to take this off
00:47:54 cause it's just so bad for me
00:47:55 it's like a tool
00:47:56 you know
00:47:57 it brings me joy
00:47:58 which is why I want to do it
00:47:59 it's just
00:48:00 you know
00:48:01 too much joy
00:48:02 and too little time
00:48:03 means that you're not gonna
00:48:04 have time to do things
00:48:05 that actually matter
00:48:06 it's just a matter
00:48:07 of like
00:48:08 you know
00:48:09 focusing your time
00:48:10 it's not a matter of
00:48:11 like any of those things
00:48:12 being bad or you know
00:48:13 it's just a matter of
00:48:14 outkitting
00:48:15 speaking of Twitter
00:48:16 we're talking about
00:48:17 my booming new
00:48:18 Twitter business
00:48:19 of selling yang 2020
00:48:20 shirts
00:48:21 on Twitter
00:48:22 they're everywhere
00:48:23 they're a sweep
00:48:25 in the nation
00:48:26 I've got celebrity endorsements
00:48:28 everyone is getting it
00:48:29 everyone is getting on
00:48:30 this train
00:48:31 I got
00:48:32 Boogie2988
00:48:33 I got
00:48:34 Monkey Jones
00:48:35 I got
00:48:36 Christine Weston Chandler
00:48:37 I got
00:48:38 Best of All
00:48:39 Lightning Bliss
00:48:40 they're all yang gang
00:48:41 they all say
00:48:42 in unison
00:48:43 in one voice creepily
00:48:44 by Ben Shirts
00:48:45 on Twitter.com
00:48:48 sort of development
00:48:49 I think like three out of
00:48:50 four of those people
00:48:51 are like in the midst of
00:48:52 PR disasters
00:48:54 yeah
00:48:55 and it was so important to them
00:48:56 it was so important to them
00:48:57 that they get this message out
00:48:58 because UBI is the future
00:49:00 automation poses a threat
00:49:02 to the modern worker
00:49:03 it's the war on normal people
00:49:04 and the opposite of
00:49:05 Donald Trump
00:49:06 is an Asian guy
00:49:07 who likes math
00:49:08 you can take that one
00:49:09 of the bank
00:49:10 my friends
00:49:11 Ben
00:49:12 Ben
00:49:13 did you Photoshop those images
00:49:14 what the fuck
00:49:15 get the fuck out of here
00:49:16 who the fuck are you
00:49:18 how fucking dare you
00:49:19 that's libel
00:49:20 libel
00:49:21 oh no
00:49:22 didn't MagiChan
00:49:23 have something to say about this
00:49:24 I don't know
00:49:25 MagiChan is a pretty reliable source
00:49:26 okay
00:49:27 okay
00:49:28 no I want more answers
00:49:29 for MagiChan
00:49:30 right
00:49:31 because
00:49:32 I tweet out
00:49:33 Christine's
00:49:34 heartfelt endorsement
00:49:35 CWC
00:49:36 endorses yang
00:49:37 for 2020
00:49:38 because she needs the UBI
00:49:39 as much as anyone
00:49:40 so
00:49:41 Christine
00:49:42 so I tweet out the endorsement
00:49:43 and MagiChan
00:49:44 okay
00:49:45 MagiChan
00:49:46 he must be a boomer
00:49:47 or something
00:49:48 because he
00:49:49 he doesn't like
00:49:50 he tries to come in
00:49:51 and libel me
00:49:52 slander me
00:49:53 saying that the image
00:49:54 is photoshopped
00:49:55 right
00:49:56 he's in the pocket
00:49:57 of mainstream media
00:49:58 he wants to bury yang
00:49:59 just like they did
00:50:00 at the first
00:50:01 at the first debates
00:50:02 by turning off his microphone
00:50:03 so I ask him
00:50:04 like why don't you
00:50:05 support yang
00:50:06 like what's
00:50:07 what's the deal
00:50:08 what's up with that
00:50:09 and he tells me
00:50:10 right he tells me
00:50:11 that Lisa Simpson
00:50:12 yeah
00:50:13 and I am intrigued by this
00:50:14 and I just
00:50:15 I want to know
00:50:16 I want to know
00:50:17 what's Lisa's platform
00:50:18 what's her stance on UBI
00:50:19 what's her
00:50:20 was she gonna
00:50:21 eliminate college debt
00:50:22 is she gonna build the wall
00:50:23 and
00:50:24 and I'm trying to get into
00:50:25 cause like I'll switch
00:50:26 right
00:50:27 if I find a better candidate
00:50:28 I will switch to supporting Lisa
00:50:29 just like
00:50:30 I just
00:50:31 I need answers
00:50:32 I need it
00:50:33 and I feel like
00:50:34 MagiChan is the only one
00:50:35 who can provide them
00:50:36 well then
00:50:37 like your shirt sales
00:50:38 have not just impacted
00:50:39 the lives of you
00:50:40 when your many
00:50:41 old customers
00:50:42 who have bought them
00:50:43 it's also impacted
00:50:44 the man that you represent
00:50:45 Andrew Yang
00:50:46 I don't know if you know
00:50:47 the spin
00:50:48 but minutes
00:50:49 after receiving the call
00:50:50 that your shirt sales
00:50:51 have broken
00:50:52 23,000
00:50:53 in the first two hours
00:50:55 Andrew Yang was found
00:50:56 celebrating
00:50:57 in Charlottesville
00:50:58 he was found dancing
00:50:59 he was found dancing
00:51:00 in Jazzercising
00:51:01 he was so over
00:51:02 was that in
00:51:03 Charlottesville
00:51:04 I think so
00:51:05 I don't know
00:51:06 was that a meeting
00:51:07 with Christine herself
00:51:08 maybe
00:51:09 maybe
00:51:10 he was walking down the streets
00:51:11 and then
00:51:12 and then
00:51:13 Chris Chan came over
00:51:14 and said hey
00:51:15 listen
00:51:16 you know about this guy
00:51:17 Ben Saini
00:51:18 he was like I watch the
00:51:19 PCP all the time
00:51:20 then he broke out and he
00:51:21 danced
00:51:22 he started doing
00:51:23 orange justice
00:51:24 he did the floss
00:51:25 man
00:51:26 all because of you
00:51:27 when do we have a gang
00:51:28 on an episode
00:51:29 it's about time
00:51:30 we've got to call
00:51:31 them that favor
00:51:32 eventually
00:51:33 well okay
00:51:34 no no no
00:51:35 he went on H3
00:51:36 he went on Rogan
00:51:37 why not us
00:51:38 no listen
00:51:39 Elon Musk too
00:51:40 aka Andrew Yang
00:51:41 was on H3 podcast
00:51:43 and on Joe Rogan
00:51:44 we've got to get
00:51:45 Elizabeth Warren
00:51:46 on the PCP
00:51:47 you guys come on
00:51:48 it's the next logical step
00:51:49 that makes sense
00:51:50 I don't think Ben
00:51:51 would be able to restrain
00:51:52 himself from murdering her
00:51:53 on site though
00:51:54 her boomerness
00:51:55 is through the fucking roof
00:51:56 no Warren's not that bad
00:51:57 Warren's basically
00:51:58 basically diet burning
00:51:59 which is
00:52:00 okay
00:52:01 it's fine
00:52:02 alright
00:52:03 anyway
00:52:04 buy my shirts

00:52:16 don't you want
00:52:17 don't you want to be
00:52:18 like boogie
00:52:19 everybody wants to be
00:52:20 like boogie
00:52:21 Ben
00:52:22 like the amount of
00:52:23 mental pirouettes
00:52:24 and physical pirouettes
00:52:25 you must have done
00:52:26 in order to make
00:52:27 the eternal fencer
00:52:28 take a hard stance
00:52:29 take a side
00:52:30 how did you do it
00:52:31 you just can't argue
00:52:32 with math
00:52:33 okay
00:52:34 Andrew Yang
00:52:35 likes math
00:52:36 UBI is the future
00:52:37 the numbers don't lie
00:52:38 1000 is more than 0
00:52:40 okay
00:52:41 it's not that hard
00:52:43 of a decision
00:52:45 what's the debate
00:52:46 I literally don't
00:52:47 it's hard to argue
00:52:48 it's hard to argue
00:52:50 so
00:52:51 that's what I've been
00:52:52 doing this week
00:52:53 will you finally
00:52:54 stop all the other
00:52:55 bullshit you're doing
00:52:56 like comics and streaming
00:52:57 and finally
00:52:58 just dedicate yourself
00:52:59 to Andrew
00:53:00 Yang
00:53:01 absolutely
00:53:02 finally
00:53:03 finally I'm
00:53:04 accomplishing something
00:53:05 simple life
00:53:06 you know I've got
00:53:07 just on this general
00:53:08 side
00:53:11 I've discovered something
00:53:13 while we were talking
00:53:14 somebody turned me on
00:53:15 to this the other day
00:53:16 I haven't watched these yet
00:53:17 I haven't looked into them
00:53:18 but
00:53:19 I'm afraid guys
00:53:20 my time was up
00:53:21 I was in
00:53:22 the people thought
00:53:23 I was the gurren login guy
00:53:24 for quite a while
00:53:25 but I'm afraid that
00:53:26 a proud
00:53:27 YouTube junior
00:53:29 a guy
00:53:30 up and coming
00:53:31 to destroy me
00:53:32 and make me look like
00:53:33 a fool in an old boomer
00:53:34 has come on the scene
00:53:35 to reveal that
00:53:36 I've been wrong about
00:53:37 everything all along
00:53:38 with this video
00:53:39 first of all
00:53:40 why you should be
00:53:41 leftist
00:53:42 about gurren login
00:53:43 and I mean
00:53:44 I wanted to watch that
00:53:45 what the fuck
00:53:46 I haven't watched it yet
00:53:47 I'm interested too
00:53:48 shit yeah I saw that
00:53:49 and I thought
00:53:50 I gotta see this
00:53:51 and then I forgot
00:53:52 I need to watch it too
00:53:53 I'm not even shitting on it
00:53:54 I have not watched it
00:53:55 I'm interested to see
00:53:56 because I know this exists
00:53:57 in response to
00:53:58 to my videos
00:53:59 and I think
00:54:00 digis as well
00:54:01 but it's followed up
00:54:02 by another one
00:54:03 don't surrender gurren login
00:54:04 to Ann Capps
00:54:06 and I think this one is
00:54:07 even more
00:54:08 so directed at me
00:54:09 he's by the same guy
00:54:10 they are shonen ronin
00:54:11 I don't know this guy
00:54:12 he seems fine
00:54:13 obviously a leftist
00:54:14 that's cool
00:54:15 but
00:54:16 I just like to go on the record
00:54:17 I joke about being
00:54:19 an anarcho capitalist
00:54:20 it's really funny
00:54:21 I'm not actually
00:54:22 an anarcho capitalist
00:54:23 just to be clear on that
00:54:26 but
00:54:27 that's it
00:54:28 that's all I have to say
00:54:29 on this subject
00:54:30 I will watch this
00:54:31 I could be more heinous
00:54:32 a politics person
00:54:33 and an anime person
00:54:35 you know
00:54:36 not to be
00:54:37 not to shed on anybody
00:54:38 but I couldn't agree more
00:54:39 bringing
00:54:40 I'm aware that my world view
00:54:41 informs my thoughts
00:54:42 on anime and stuff
00:54:43 but to make it a hard line
00:54:45 you know me
00:54:46 don't like talking politics
00:54:47 in such terms
00:54:48 and you know
00:54:49 like this title
00:54:50 why you should be a leftist
00:54:51 I think we could agree
00:54:52 there's attributes
00:54:53 that are positive about that
00:54:55 I won't let you do this
00:54:57 Nate
00:54:58 you can't pretend as though
00:54:59 you're not
00:55:00 you don't also engage
00:55:01 in any political discussion here
00:55:02 you're not like half of it
00:55:03 well
00:55:04 I mean
00:55:05 what's the title of like
00:55:06 my video
00:55:07 it's just like
00:55:08 why Gurren Lagann is good
00:55:09 no I don't know
00:55:10 I'm not thinking about that
00:55:11 I'm just saying that
00:55:12 you are
00:55:13 you are a political
00:55:14 just talking about it
00:55:15 we do this all the time
00:55:16 on the piece of paper
00:55:17 well okay
00:55:18 now that's certainly true
00:55:19 but I'm not an anarcho capitalist
00:55:20 you could call me a libertarian
00:55:21 you know what my political views are
00:55:22 here's
00:55:23 here's my political stance
00:55:24 Andrew Yang
00:55:25 sounds like a fucking
00:55:26 mortal combat character
00:55:27 yeah
00:55:28 that's all I got to say about that
00:55:30 and he's as static as fuck
00:55:33 I don't know who this
00:55:34 Andrew Yang character is
00:55:35 but this Andrew Yang person
00:55:36 that's in real life
00:55:37 aka outside my apartment
00:55:38 so he's hanging out in the
00:55:39 salt splash beach
00:55:40 he's been just terrorizing
00:55:41 the citizens lately
00:55:42 and I'm really scared of him
00:55:43 have you seen that
00:55:44 have you seen this
00:55:45 so there's the Andrew Yang
00:55:46 platform
00:55:47 where you gain a thousand dollars
00:55:48 not even a good
00:55:49 mortal combat character either
00:55:50 I'm talking like
00:55:51 ultimate mortal combat 3
00:55:52 like one of the random
00:55:53 I think I know what you're
00:55:54 gonna say
00:55:55 I'm gonna say that
00:55:56 there's also the competing
00:55:57 platform of Andrew Yin
00:55:58 to the Yang
00:55:59 where you lose a thousand
00:56:01 dollars if you elect him
00:56:02 to the presidency
00:56:03 tough tough call
00:56:04 it's a tough choice
00:56:05 it's a tough call
00:56:06 Nate what if
00:56:07 we pose your hypothetical
00:56:08 what if you make your
00:56:10 you make some
00:56:11 not you
00:56:12 someone anyone
00:56:13 makes a video right
00:56:14 titles it in some
00:56:15 titles it in some
00:56:16 perfectly apolitical
00:56:17 X is good way
00:56:18 and then in explaining
00:56:19 why it's good
00:56:20 they implicitly endorse
00:56:22 a certain
00:56:23 a certain
00:56:24 a certain political
00:56:25 political or economic
00:56:26 worldview
00:56:27 I mean I would totally agree
00:56:28 to that but
00:56:29 I mean like
00:56:30 let's just take my video
00:56:31 for example
00:56:32 like what's my
00:56:33 like my main thesis
00:56:34 of the video
00:56:35 is that line about
00:56:36 like ask not for
00:56:37 lighter burdens
00:56:38 ask for broader shoulders
00:56:39 I think that's pretty
00:56:40 clearly like
00:56:41 not a leftist view
00:56:42 of the world
00:56:43 that is very much
00:56:44 so you're saying
00:56:45 it is political
00:56:46 no I'm saying
00:56:47 that I mean
00:56:48 there's explicitly
00:56:49 political where
00:56:50 you're advocating
00:56:51 for a specific
00:56:52 like team
00:56:53 which I think
00:56:54 saying why you
00:56:55 should be a leftist
00:56:56 is doing so
00:56:57 I find it
00:56:58 I don't really like to
00:56:59 talk in those terms
00:57:00 when I talk about these things
00:57:01 I have absolutely
00:57:02 no clue
00:57:03 what you're trying to say
00:57:04 I mean
00:57:05 you can advocate
00:57:06 for a worldview
00:57:07 without saying like
00:57:08 that's why you should
00:57:09 vote Democrat
00:57:10 or that's why you should
00:57:11 vote Republican
00:57:12 so your problem
00:57:13 why are you saying
00:57:14 problem
00:57:15 your problem is not
00:57:16 your problem is not
00:57:17 your problem is not
00:57:18 with something
00:57:19 being political
00:57:20 it's with something
00:57:21 admitting to
00:57:22 being political
00:57:23 well first of all
00:57:24 who's got a problem
00:57:25 there is no problem
00:57:26 against what
00:57:27 you're saying that it's
00:57:28 you're saying there are
00:57:29 negative aspects
00:57:30 to a title
00:57:31 like why you should be
00:57:32 a leftist
00:57:33 no I'm saying
00:57:34 I don't want to do that
00:57:35 so I don't
00:57:36 that's what I'm saying
00:57:37 it's that time again folks
00:57:38 it's time for this
00:57:39 there's no political
00:57:40 discussion here
00:57:41 it's just
00:57:42 it's interesting to say
00:57:43 there is
00:57:44 there is Nate
00:57:45 there is
00:57:46 I mean to label me
00:57:47 an ANCAP
00:57:48 I didn't do that
00:57:49 even though
00:57:50 you could probably
00:57:51 make a pretty strong
00:57:52 argument for it
00:57:53 but I'm not doing that
00:57:54 I mean how do you
00:57:55 resolve that with me
00:57:56 just saying I'm not
00:57:57 because I think
00:57:58 maybe you are
00:57:59 agreeing to many leftist
00:58:00 positions
00:58:01 well I mean
00:58:02 maybe
00:58:03 I don't know
00:58:04 you seem pretty in line
00:58:05 with that whole thing
00:58:06 you seem to be all about
00:58:07 personal responsibility
00:58:08 but I don't believe in
00:58:09 anarchy
00:58:10 I don't believe in anarchy
00:58:12 okay so
00:58:13 alright fine
00:58:14 okay alright
00:58:15 we did it
00:58:16 but that doesn't matter
00:58:17 you totally move the goalpost
00:58:18 did I
00:58:19 yeah we were talking about
00:58:20 something else
00:58:21 and then you say
00:58:22 okay but I'm not an ANCAP
00:58:23 and then the conversation
00:58:24 becomes about that
00:58:25 well I don't care
00:58:26 I don't care about that
00:58:27 okay
00:58:28 I want to know
00:58:29 I feel like the way
00:58:30 Nate moves the goalpost
00:58:31 is like
00:58:32 completely in a
00:58:33 klutzy way
00:58:34 he has no idea that he did it
00:58:35 he doesn't
00:58:36 what is
00:58:37 what's
00:58:38 how do you feel
00:58:39 okay how do you feel about this
00:58:40 why you should be a leftist video
00:58:41 I mean I think it's
00:58:42 well first of all
00:58:43 the why you should be a leftist
00:58:44 okay first of all
00:58:45 I haven't watched
00:58:46 either of them
00:58:47 I have not watched
00:58:48 either of these videos
00:58:49 okay me either
00:58:50 in the description
00:58:51 well rather in the comments
00:58:52 I see people being like
00:58:53 don't surrender to Nate and Digi
00:58:55 I see in like a couple of comments
00:58:56 so I'm inferring
00:58:57 that there's discussion
00:58:58 of our positions
00:58:59 I mean I know Digi's a capitalist
00:59:01 I'm sure of that much
00:59:02 as am I
00:59:03 no he made a video
00:59:04 like the other day
00:59:06 like saying that he doesn't like
00:59:07 ascribe any specific political
00:59:09 oh that's fucking dumb
00:59:11 he has he believes in things
00:59:13 on the left or the right
00:59:14 I mean I guess he's a capitalist
00:59:15 oh yeah
00:59:16 I don't fucking know
00:59:17 I don't fucking know
00:59:18 I think it's
00:59:19 oh yeah I have no
00:59:20 I have no opinion about anything
00:59:22 no that's not fucking it
00:59:24 I have no opinion about anything
00:59:25 he has opinions on
00:59:26 I just think everything's fine
00:59:27 as it is
00:59:28 I don't really think
00:59:29 that's the position
00:59:30 I am a neoliberal capitalist
00:59:31 Ben that's such a fucking straw man
00:59:33 that's the typical
00:59:35 centrist boogeyman
00:59:36 that people just make up
00:59:37 yeah that's what it means
00:59:38 it's not
00:59:39 when someone says they're a centrist
00:59:40 or that they don't believe
00:59:41 that they don't take sides
00:59:42 it doesn't mean that
00:59:43 they just believe in nothing
00:59:44 and they have no opinions
00:59:45 it means that their opinions
00:59:46 aren't fucking rigidly held
00:59:48 to one fucking moral standard
00:59:49 on one side of the fucking
00:59:50 coin or the other
00:59:51 yeah
00:59:52 if they have different beliefs
00:59:53 about different shit
00:59:54 did she didn't say
00:59:55 he believes in nothing
00:59:56 he just was like
00:59:58 making it clear
00:59:59 that he's not on the left
01:00:00 or the right specifically
01:00:01 if you're not on the left
01:00:03 or the right
01:00:04 then I'm sorry
01:00:05 but you're on the right
01:00:06 you're a neoliberal
01:00:07 you're a neoliberal
01:00:08 that doesn't make sense
01:00:09 it literally does make sense
01:00:12 because the overton window
01:00:13 has shifted right
01:00:14 oh my fucking god
01:00:15 that is so dumb
01:00:16 it's not dumb
01:00:17 it makes perfect sense
01:00:18 if you understand
01:00:19 how neoliberalism works
01:00:20 can't you have complex views
01:00:22 of various political things
01:00:23 that put you neither on either side
01:00:25 you can want some things to change
01:00:27 but not the other side
01:00:28 are you saying that if you're
01:00:29 if we don't believe
01:00:30 that's not what I'm saying though
01:00:31 are you saying if we don't
01:00:32 agree with your perspectives
01:00:34 that we're on the right
01:00:35 is that
01:00:36 I mean like
01:00:37 when it kind of boils down to it
01:00:38 I'm saying
01:00:39 that if you take no position
01:00:41 you implicitly endorse
01:00:42 the status quo
01:00:43 you're not taking
01:00:44 no position
01:00:45 no one is taking
01:00:46 no positions
01:00:47 then
01:00:48 if you say you're not
01:00:49 it could just mean like
01:00:50 I think that people
01:00:51 should be allowed to have abortions
01:00:52 and I think people
01:00:53 should be allowed to have guns
01:00:54 that's two positions
01:00:55 it's not taking no positions
01:00:57 you have different opinions
01:00:59 about different issues
01:01:00 and you take them
01:01:01 one at a fucking time
01:01:02 right
01:01:03 those are both
01:01:04 conservative positions
01:01:05 oh they're not
01:01:06 what
01:01:07 having a being pro
01:01:08 oh sorry
01:01:09 I misunderstood
01:01:11 look
01:01:12 they're different axes
01:01:13 they're different axes
01:01:14 to be left or right on
01:01:16 I agree
01:01:17 the thing that is just
01:01:18 you're reacting
01:01:19 to my oversimplification
01:01:20 of a thing did you said
01:01:21 in a video
01:01:22 and you haven't seen the video
01:01:23 so just
01:01:24 I would rather people
01:01:25 like
01:01:26 don't
01:01:27 like make big assumptions like that
01:01:29 like
01:01:30 you know
01:01:31 yell at me I guess
01:01:32 don't yell
01:01:33 don't yell at didgy
01:01:34 for having things like
01:01:35 your case
01:01:36 we don't want to make any assumptions
01:01:38 that's just like
01:01:39 I don't want to make any assumptions
01:01:40 about the contents of these videos
01:01:41 I just thought the titles were funny
01:01:42 and I know that they're directed at me
01:01:44 and possibly did you to another degree
01:01:46 isn't that funny you guys
01:01:47 I'm gonna watch this later
01:01:48 and see what I think about
01:01:49 I think it's funny
01:01:50 I will also
01:01:51 agree
01:01:52 okay I understand what you're saying
01:01:53 about
01:01:54 okay I guess what you're saying
01:01:55 is that didgy says
01:01:56 he's not on the left or the right
01:01:57 because
01:01:58 he has
01:01:59 like
01:02:00 individual views on particular topics
01:02:02 and he is not entirely on one side of it
01:02:04 like yeah like
01:02:05 everyone is like that to a certain extent
01:02:06 that's all that anyone
01:02:07 ever means when they say
01:02:08 I'm not on the left right
01:02:09 north or south
01:02:10 I'm on the fucking
01:02:11 I'm on the fucking underbelly
01:02:14 that's what
01:02:15 that's what side I'm on
01:02:16 fair enough
01:02:18 well
01:02:19 there it is
01:02:20 I got a new thing to talk about
01:02:21 I made my first
01:02:23 rowdy fucker's cop killer
01:02:24 slime girl character
01:02:25 wait
01:02:26 oh god wait
01:02:27 I have one more thing to say
01:02:28 about what we just said
01:02:29 no no
01:02:30 the politics
01:02:31 the politics is over
01:02:32 slime only
01:02:33 slime only
01:02:34 one last thing
01:02:35 one last thing
01:02:36 okay I understand that thing
01:02:37 about how you can have bits and pieces here
01:02:38 that are more
01:02:39 more conservative and more liberal
01:02:40 okay
01:02:41 but if you say
01:02:42 I'm not a capitalist
01:02:43 then what are you
01:02:44 if the answer is
01:02:45 nothing in particular
01:02:47 unless you have a specific thing
01:02:48 that you are
01:02:49 that is opposed to capitalism
01:02:50 then you are just saying
01:02:51 I already
01:02:52 then you are just endorsing
01:02:53 the status quo
01:02:54 no you're not
01:02:55 Ben
01:02:56 who is a capitalist
01:02:57 just with limitations
01:02:58 therefore a democratic socialist
01:02:59 or whatever
01:03:00 Ben how was he
01:03:01 well he's a capitalist
01:03:02 I think the
01:03:03 I guess
01:03:04 the thing there then
01:03:05 is that I
01:03:06 interjected incorrectly
01:03:07 because did you
01:03:08 I don't think said anything
01:03:09 about capitalism
01:03:10 he was talking about left or
01:03:11 right in the video I was watching
01:03:12 okay
01:03:13 well I already
01:03:15 solved this dilemma
01:03:16 like 50 episodes ago
01:03:17 when I invented
01:03:18 my political philosophy
01:03:20 and our co-fascism
01:03:22 right
01:03:23 you
01:03:24 legalize it
01:03:25 it's already a thing
01:03:26 I'm sorry
01:03:27 it's not already a thing
01:03:28 I invented it
01:03:29 it doesn't make any sense
01:03:30 it's not okay
01:03:31 first of all I take
01:03:32 more offense
01:03:33 drag has talked about it
01:03:35 I fucking set up
01:03:36 before god damn drag
01:03:37 who is drag
01:03:38 I don't care
01:03:39 never mind
01:03:40 I don't
01:03:41 I invented it
01:03:42 it's not a thing
01:03:43 well there you go
01:03:44 drag can go fuck himself
01:03:46 tell me about an
01:03:47 our co-fascism
01:03:48 oh my god
01:03:49 tell me
01:03:50 I already did this
01:03:51 on a previous episode
01:03:52 of this
01:03:53 can you summarize it
01:03:54 in a line
01:03:55 what's the
01:03:56 what's the thrust
01:03:57 it's cool
01:03:58 that's what it is
01:03:59 it's just what you're being cool
01:04:00 it's the philosophy
01:04:01 that the only
01:04:02 political systems
01:04:03 that will ever be
01:04:04 right and fair and just
01:04:05 are either
01:04:06 complete anarchy
01:04:07 or complete fascism
01:04:08 and everything in between
01:04:09 is a worthless
01:04:10 half measure
01:04:11 which makes everything
01:04:12 unfair and shitty
01:04:14 I invented that
01:04:15 it's my
01:04:16 thing
01:04:17 and I'm
01:04:18 I'm less offended
01:04:19 at you saying
01:04:20 it makes no sense
01:04:21 than you saying that
01:04:22 someone else said it first
01:04:24 maybe they have
01:04:25 a different definition
01:04:26 or something
01:04:27 I don't know
01:04:28 there's nothing new
01:04:29 under the sun
01:04:30 man
01:04:31 okay
01:04:32 slime
01:04:33 anyway
01:04:34 tell me about slime
01:04:35 I made a slime girl
01:04:37 I've seen
01:04:38 there are slime girls
01:04:39 in rfck
01:04:41 you don't do anything
01:04:42 gameplay wise
01:04:43 to create them
01:04:44 you just draw them
01:04:45 and then they're canon
01:04:46 yes
01:04:47 how does every single thing
01:04:48 in rck
01:04:49 sometimes
01:04:50 no some of them are
01:04:51 slime oids
01:04:52 that exist in game
01:04:53 oh yeah
01:04:54 that is true
01:04:55 true
01:04:56 yeah
01:04:57 but I made
01:04:58 I made one
01:04:59 and I think she's
01:05:00 pretty fucking cool
01:05:01 cause she's not like
01:05:02 the typical
01:05:03 beauty
01:05:04 slime
01:05:05 like fuck toy
01:05:06 slime girl
01:05:07 like all the others
01:05:08 slime girls
01:05:09 they're all just
01:05:10 fuck toys
01:05:11 they have
01:05:12 they have feelings man
01:05:13 they're all
01:05:14 even the sexy
01:05:15 it's no special
01:05:16 they have a sexy one
01:05:17 they feel
01:05:18 they're all sculpted with
01:05:19 bedroom eyes
01:05:20 like permanently locked
01:05:21 on their face
01:05:22 I saw this
01:05:23 in community service
01:05:24 I saw this
01:05:25 when you first posted it
01:05:26 and I thought it was really nice
01:05:27 and I liked your fallup
01:05:28 gun girl comic
01:05:29 what do you have to say about it
01:05:32 I don't know
01:05:33 I apologize
01:05:34 okay
01:05:36 I like rfck
01:05:37 can we talk about that
01:05:38 just a little bit
01:05:39 oh we can
01:05:40 I'm afraid
01:05:41 you know
01:05:42 I don't know
01:05:43 I'm afraid that the more
01:05:44 we talk about
01:05:45 the more people are gonna hate it
01:05:46 who are on the fence
01:05:47 I have a feeling that
01:05:48 like the vast majority
01:05:49 of PCP heads
01:05:50 like know what it is
01:05:51 and they're like
01:05:52 oh god this should get
01:05:53 now I hate it for no reason
01:05:54 I think quite a few
01:05:55 have come to a decision
01:05:56 that they don't know
01:05:57 what that is
01:05:58 and they're not interested
01:05:59 in looking into it
01:06:00 for whatever right or wrong
01:06:01 you know whatever reason
01:06:02 I think a lot of the time
01:06:03 it's just because it's
01:06:04 mostly munchy and Ben
01:06:05 who are like
01:06:06 advertising talking it
01:06:07 yeah I suppose
01:06:08 it up
01:06:09 when is PCP university lecture
01:06:11 rfck
01:06:12 literally next time
01:06:13 we're literally next
01:06:14 oh my god
01:06:15 there you go
01:06:16 okay I should talk about it
01:06:18 if I want to
01:06:19 about the PCP lectures
01:06:20 alright so
01:06:21 like part of this whole
01:06:22 like
01:06:24 Christine Weston Chandler
01:06:25 endorses yang thing
01:06:26 which is canon
01:06:27 it really happened
01:06:28 it's true not photoshop
01:06:29 of course
01:06:30 like I was
01:06:31 I was reading

01:06:33 post transition
01:06:34 sonichu
01:06:35 right
01:06:36 and this shit needs a lecture
01:06:37 like the desert needs the rain

01:06:41 fucking
01:06:42 oh I'm so glad
01:06:43 I'm so glad

01:07:08 yeah okay
01:07:09 so and then
01:07:10 like a huge amount of it
01:07:12 is basically delivered
01:07:13 in like text dump

01:07:59 Brad cunt for when
01:08:00 Brad cunt for when
01:08:01 one of these days
01:08:02 hey would you guys
01:08:03 let me know in the comments
01:08:04 would you give money
01:08:05 for radcon for kickstarters
01:08:07 oh no
01:08:08 would you do that
01:08:09 would you give us money
01:08:10 is that the official name
01:08:11 for radcon for
01:08:12 radcon for when
01:08:13 would you give us money
01:08:14 please
01:08:15 I think we have to abandon
01:08:16 the radcon for ever plan
01:08:17 the devourage
01:08:18 we suggest it
01:08:19 because it's not forever
01:08:20 it's far from it
01:08:21 it's
01:08:22 it's very limited time
01:08:23 only
01:08:24 if we can't
01:08:25 then high five rfckhq
01:08:26 happen way before pcbhq
01:08:27 and we're real and we're
01:08:28 actually cool
01:08:29 what's rfckhq
01:08:30 bam
01:08:31 I mean we both
01:08:32 we live in the same place
01:08:33 and now rfckhq is
01:08:34 only in person now
01:08:35 it's rfckhq
01:08:36 is it
01:08:37 boston
01:08:38 that seems a little bit
01:08:39 cheating
01:08:40 it's like
01:08:41 a city
01:08:42 why is it
01:08:43 cheating
01:08:44 how is it
01:08:45 cheating
01:08:46 an hq is not
01:08:47 a city
01:08:48 munchie
01:08:49 do I have to explain this
01:08:50 to your puny baby
01:08:51 the point of pcbhq
01:08:52 was never that
01:08:53 we would all live in
01:08:54 the same house
01:08:55 it was that we'd live
01:08:56 in the same
01:08:57 it was initially
01:08:58 the same house
01:08:59 it quickly became
01:09:00 gas
01:09:01 also can I
01:09:02 I know I'm not involved at all
01:09:03 but you have to
01:09:04 change the name from
01:09:05 rfckhq
01:09:06 to rfckapital
01:09:09 oh you know
01:09:10 that makes sense
01:09:11 what
01:09:12 die
01:09:13 uh oh
01:09:14 hey
01:09:15 weren't you in
01:09:16 who was that who just drew
01:09:17 a picture of tom
01:09:18 and rfck
01:09:19 that was
01:09:20 acro
01:09:21 that's right
01:09:22 it was sick
01:09:23 you were
01:09:24 weren't you the general
01:09:25 of the juvies or something
01:09:26 yeah I think it's
01:09:27 cause did I say that
01:09:28 in the last
01:09:29 rowdy fuckers copular stream
01:09:30 that was on
01:09:31 that I mentioned that
01:09:32 yeah
01:09:33 that would be tom oliver
01:09:34 king of the juvies
01:09:35 that's good
01:09:37 to worship juvie hova
01:09:38 take it
01:09:39 you know what
01:09:40 you can have it
01:09:41 you can have it
01:09:42 no one wants that crown
01:09:43 it's yours for the take
01:09:44 the crown weighs heavy
01:09:45 just like the man himself
01:09:47 back in the day
01:09:48 he was
01:09:49 disrespected
01:09:50 but his legacy lives on
01:09:51 past everyone
01:09:52 it's a true crown of thorns
01:09:53 I'm thinking about
01:09:54 I'm thinking about continuity
01:09:56 I'm thinking
01:09:57 I'm thinking that
01:09:58 rfck
01:09:59 probably
01:10:00 takes place
01:10:01 in the same
01:10:02 universe
01:10:03 as a sonichu
01:10:04 c197
01:10:05 I'm thinking
01:10:06 I'm thinking tbap
01:10:07 probably does too
01:10:08 this is all like
01:10:09 I'm thinking
01:10:10 there's no reason
01:10:11 why these dimensions
01:10:12 can't like
01:10:13 you know
01:10:14 connect with one another
01:10:15 I did I see no reason
01:10:16 why
01:10:17 and also in my head
01:10:18 ever since
01:10:19 like the first
01:10:20 crossover
01:10:21 that I felt was
01:10:22 important
01:10:23 I can't remember what it was
01:10:25 but it was a pony thing
01:10:26 ever since then
01:10:27 I've always been
01:10:28 in my mind
01:10:29 like spinning
01:10:30 a web of like
01:10:31 connections
01:10:32 to connect everything
01:10:33 I've ever done
01:10:34 and like
01:10:35 and all my friends
01:10:36 all together
01:10:37 in a cool like
01:10:38 yeah you know
01:10:39 that could work
01:10:40 and you know
01:10:41 considering the unusual
01:10:42 amount of slime
01:10:43 grime scum
01:10:44 and villainy
01:10:45 in the city
01:10:46 the unnamed city
01:10:47 I believe
01:10:48 I'm thinking that
01:10:49 7
01:10:50 the movie 7
01:10:51 by David Fincher
01:10:52 probably takes place
01:10:53 in the same universe
01:10:54 starring Brad Pitt
01:10:55 Morgan Freeman baby
01:10:56 all fictional characters
01:10:57 all fictional characters
01:10:58 exist in dimension
01:10:59 C197
01:11:00 and our dimension
01:11:01 dimension 1218
01:11:02 is merging with it
01:11:03 to create dimension
01:11:04 3
01:11:05 C
01:11:06 dash
01:11:07 1
01:11:08 2
01:11:09 whatever
01:11:10 it doesn't matter
01:11:11 our dimensions are merging
01:11:12 like zoos will be real
01:11:13 slime city
01:11:14 will be real
01:11:15 it's all
01:11:16 the movie 7
01:11:17 will be real
01:11:18 David Fincher
01:11:19 will finally at last
01:11:20 be real
01:11:21 yeah
01:11:22 so I will all live together
01:11:23 in harmony
01:11:24 the putty cast
01:11:25 and the pony cast
01:11:26 sail in the same ocean
01:11:27 oh yeah
01:11:28 magic hand says
01:11:29 that the
01:11:30 magic hand says
01:11:31 that the dimensional merge
01:11:32 is coming soon
01:11:33 and let's not forget
01:11:34 arm retrieval and potty cast
01:11:35 have a crossover
01:11:36 therefore all of homestuck
01:11:38 so that
01:11:39 so that all of homestuck
01:11:40 is canon 2
01:11:42 one piece
01:11:43 it's all in there
01:11:44 are you stealing your dads
01:11:46 I've always thought
01:11:48 that they're like
01:11:49 parallel universes
01:11:50 to rf2k
01:11:51 they're very similar
01:11:52 in a lot of ways
01:11:53 slime never existed
01:11:54 but oil did
01:11:55 well I
01:11:56 I imagine it's almost
01:11:57 like if
01:11:58 if stealing your dad
01:11:59 is like in the far future
01:12:00 from rf2k
01:12:01 where like
01:12:02 slime city just becomes
01:12:03 slime everywhere
01:12:04 like slime world
01:12:05 and then like
01:12:06 after it all progresses
01:12:07 slime is all dried up
01:12:08 but morals and society
01:12:09 is still fucked forever
01:12:10 and that's when
01:12:11 stealing your dad
01:12:12 takes place
01:12:13 okay that sounds good
01:12:15 boy
01:12:16 this went way off the rail
01:12:18 guys I'm so mad
01:12:19 let's bring it
01:12:20 I have to bring it back
01:12:21 to the political thing
01:12:22 I hate to be the bad guy
01:12:24 and bring it back to that
01:12:25 but because
01:12:26 because Ben brought up
01:12:28 that like
01:12:29 my hilarious and cool
01:12:31 political ideology
01:12:33 has been bow guarded
01:12:34 by smooth brains
01:12:35 all over the internet
01:12:36 you know I went on google
01:12:37 just to fact check
01:12:38 and make sure
01:12:39 and sure enough
01:12:40 there's an urban dictionary
01:12:41 for anarcho fascism
01:12:42 and just listen
01:12:43 you know
01:12:44 you heard how I defined it
01:12:45 you heard my cool
01:12:46 philosophy
01:12:47 what the philosophy
01:12:48 actually is
01:12:49 as created by me
01:12:50 global icon
01:12:51 and national treasure
01:12:52 endless jest
01:12:53 listen to how
01:12:54 these fucking
01:12:55 smooth brain
01:12:56 political fucktards
01:12:57 have butchered
01:12:58 my political philosophy
01:13:01 anarcho which
01:13:02 yeah
01:13:03 okay go on
01:13:04 sorry sorry
01:13:05 anarcho fascism
01:13:06 is based on the premise
01:13:07 that in post capital
01:13:09 in parentheses
01:13:10 cryptocurrency centric
01:13:11 societies
01:13:12 racial identitarianism
01:13:14 loses its stigma
01:13:15 anarcho fascism
01:13:16 or national in parentheses
01:13:18 nationalist anarchism propounds
01:13:21 what the fuck
01:13:22 propounds is not a word
01:13:23 I refuse to believe that
01:13:24 that only ethnic cohesion
01:13:26 can form self-referential societies
01:13:28 in the wake of capitalism's collapse
01:13:30 in the absence of
01:13:31 identitarian action
01:13:32 national anarchism believes that
01:13:34 capitalism specifically
01:13:35 global capitalism
01:13:36 will collapse into Marxism
01:13:38 the exclusive precursor
01:13:40 to 5G
01:13:41 in parentheses
01:13:42 fifth generation warfare
01:13:43 what the hell
01:13:44 they've butchered it
01:13:45 they've ruined it
01:13:46 yeah
01:13:47 what the fuck
01:13:48 that sounds very good
01:13:49 it doesn't make any sense
01:13:51 you know you know
01:13:52 it's just
01:13:53 how is anarcho
01:13:54 this is how
01:13:55 it was like a bunch of noise
01:13:56 it was noise
01:13:57 it was a bunch of meaningless
01:13:58 drivel and words
01:13:59 this is the problem
01:14:00 the world has been so fucking
01:14:01 poisoned with politics
01:14:03 that when someone comes up with
01:14:04 something that is pure
01:14:05 and hilarious and cool
01:14:06 like my anarcho fascism
01:14:08 wait
01:14:09 like a political system
01:14:10 yeah
01:14:11 what's the deal
01:14:12 immediately the world just takes it
01:14:14 and they just add words to it
01:14:15 and they add bullshit to it
01:14:16 and make it mean nothing
01:14:18 and make it a stupid meme
01:14:19 it was a fucking
01:14:20 it was a cool meme
01:14:21 I made a cool meme
01:14:22 and they made it stupid
01:14:24 because they added
01:14:25 what the fuck is this
01:14:26 is this like a real thing
01:14:28 I do hate when people make things
01:14:30 too grounded in real politics
01:14:32 Jesse what's the date of this entry

01:14:41 doesn't predate your state
01:14:43 it might but mine is better
01:14:44 my idea was so much better
01:14:46 my idea was pure
01:14:47 and it was funny
01:14:48 and it was cool
01:14:49 is a political ideology
01:14:51 how can you make it
01:14:52 too about real world politics
01:14:54 it's not a political ideology
01:14:55 it's me being cool
01:14:56 well I like Jesse's funny
01:14:57 definition better

01:15:17 I'm just trying to be cool
01:15:18 I'm just doing cool stuff
01:15:20 saying cool things
01:15:21 having cool ideas
01:15:23 and you know
01:15:24 they're simple
01:15:25 and anyone can understand them
01:15:26 and you hear them
01:15:27 and you go hey
01:15:28 that's pretty fucking funny
01:15:29 and everyone has a good time
01:15:30 I'm just here
01:15:31 making sure people have a good time
01:15:32 and over here
01:15:33 if you're gonna sell
01:15:34 a narco fascist shirts
01:15:35 please put them on a different site
01:15:37 don't put them on the pcp
01:15:38 teespring please
01:15:39 too late
01:15:40 why
01:15:41 because
01:15:42 Ben can't be associated
01:15:44 with his mortal enemy
01:15:46 yeah
01:15:47 I'm really sorry
01:15:48 I'm really sorry
01:15:49 that I don't want the pcp
01:15:50 selling fucking fascism
01:15:51 on t-shirt
01:15:52 I mean look
01:15:53 I don't thank you
01:15:54 I don't really give a shit
01:15:55 no one's making a t-shirt
01:15:56 you're getting nothing to do
01:15:57 with anything
01:15:58 I thought you said something about shirt
01:15:59 okay whatever
01:16:00 if Ben had the good graces
01:16:01 to put the yang thing
01:16:02 on his own thing
01:16:03 then let's keep all
01:16:04 political shirts
01:16:05 you know
01:16:06 my point is
01:16:07 no idea can just be
01:16:08 pure and funny and cool
01:16:09 someone has to take it too seriously
01:16:11 and turn it into a thing
01:16:13 with words
01:16:14 like identitarianism in it
01:16:16 and propounds
01:16:18 I sympathize
01:16:19 I truly do
01:16:20 with people
01:16:21 who are very concerned
01:16:22 about politics day to day
01:16:23 and they worry that the world
01:16:24 is going in bad directions
01:16:25 but certainly
01:16:26 we could all agree
01:16:27 that sometimes
01:16:28 you just want to be cool
01:16:29 and you just want to
01:16:30 hang out
01:16:31 and suck your own dick
01:16:32 if you don't
01:16:33 if you don't feel
01:16:34 like thinking about
01:16:35 real world politics
01:16:36 then maybe
01:16:37 maybe don't
01:16:38 talk about
01:16:39 an arc of fascism
01:16:40 like that's
01:16:41 that's
01:16:42 talk about something else
01:16:43 Ben it's not
01:16:44 it's not real world
01:16:45 politics
01:16:46 no one even believes
01:16:47 in an arc of fascism
01:16:48 you just described
01:16:49 real world politics
01:16:50 I did not
01:16:51 these are not real words Ben
01:16:52 what the hell does
01:16:53 identitarianism mean
01:16:54 well I literally
01:16:56 know the answer to that
01:16:57 but I don't want to
01:16:58 get into it
01:16:59 what the hell does
01:17:00 what the hell does
01:17:01 based on the premise
01:17:02 that in post-capital
01:17:03 cryptocurrency
01:17:04 centric society
01:17:05 is racial identitarian
01:17:06 loses its sigma
01:17:07 that's not words man
01:17:08 yes it is
01:17:09 it means
01:17:10 racism becomes cool
01:17:11 and everyone forms
01:17:12 that is not my
01:17:14 well that is not
01:17:15 my anarco fascism
01:17:16 that doesn't even
01:17:17 I know and that's why
01:17:18 I don't want to fucking
01:17:19 associate myself with this
01:17:20 that doesn't even
01:17:21 that doesn't even sound
01:17:22 like it should be called
01:17:23 anarco fascism
01:17:24 that should have a different name
01:17:25 like my
01:17:26 I really don't get the
01:17:27 anarco ass
01:17:28 okay you know what
01:17:29 I don't care
01:17:30 well it's anarco because
01:17:31 it's not imposed
01:17:32 from the top down
01:17:33 the whole point of
01:17:34 my bit is that
01:17:35 like it is
01:17:36 what it sounds like
01:17:37 like the words
01:17:38 are opposites
01:17:39 and that's why
01:17:40 it's funny
01:17:41 that's just what I thought
01:17:42 I was like
01:17:43 what is this
01:17:44 this is
01:17:45 what is this
01:17:46 this definition
01:17:47 that I'm looking at here
01:17:48 does not sound like
01:17:49 that
01:17:51 this is a measurable battle
01:17:52 this is a battle
01:17:53 which you can win
01:17:54 and the way
01:17:55 you win
01:17:56 is by getting
01:17:57 your definition so popular
01:17:58 it becomes the
01:17:59 number one definition
01:18:00 on urban dictionary
01:18:02 that's how you win
01:18:03 the battle
01:18:04 once again
01:18:05 society has conspired
01:18:07 to ruin one of
01:18:08 my bits
01:18:09 that's how it always
01:18:10 I'm a bit machine over here, and I'm just cranking out cool stuff and and hilarious
01:18:15 Witticisms and slogans and and and I'm making people have fun
01:18:19 I'm creating fun for the world, but the world just can't handle the world doesn't want fun any world in anymore
01:18:25 The world doesn't want fun the world just wants like weird political shit that they can argue about so they took they take all my fun
01:18:31 Bits and they and they corrupt them and they pervert them into this and it just makes me sad for humanity
01:18:38 You know when a character gets drunk in a party in a movie and the camera starts like wishing around
01:18:43 It's like a zoom in and out just like tilting over and over and over again
01:18:46 And then like the screen starts to fade black and the character falls on the floor. That's been me for like 35
01:18:54 All right, all right speaking speaking of UBI I've decided I no longer need UBI because I've found a way
01:19:00 I found a way to give myself a thousand dollars a month, okay, and it's fucking fantastic. Yeah, so it's called crying
01:19:06 With UBI you could have two thousand dollars. I guess I guess but but we all
01:19:15 You got me back on the train, but um so I
01:19:18 We've we've been long discussing the the energy drink wars, you know, we got the bansters Roman streets, of course
01:19:26 We got the C4 heads. I'm a newly formed C4. We got the rain
01:19:30 Fucking I'm a rain. I'm a rain now that 7-eleven offers two for one rain
01:19:35 You're a rain cyst. Are you saying you're a rain?
01:19:38 I'm a rain cyst. Yeah, rain. Rainsy rainsy rainsy in economics, baby
01:19:42 I've dabbled a bit here and there and all these these newfangled
01:19:46 Zoomer drinks, but I'm still I'm still clinging hardcore to the OG Red Bull
01:19:50 Red Bull is the best dude. So it costs like eight dollars a can. That's my point
01:19:56 This is the problem the big problem with Red Bull is that it comes in an 8.4 fluid ounce can on average
01:20:03 But it costs the exact same as a 16 fluid ounce can of any other energy drink, which is shit
01:20:10 But yeah, it is yesterday
01:20:12 I was crippled in my bed because I can't move anywhere and I needed groceries
01:20:16 So I decided to order Instacart from Aldi and Aldi has yes red
01:20:22 Thunder which is Red Bull, but not and it's you get a pack of four for three
01:20:29 Dollars and it is that has instantly given me like a thousand dollars a month back because I no longer have to spend like
01:20:36 60 to a hundred dollars on am I crippling Red Bull addiction? I can spend a fraction of the price
01:20:42 I have seen I have seen red Thunder at Aldi. Aldi is really good. I work if you like monster
01:20:48 I recommend gridlock. I also did I got the red one is the best one
01:20:54 I've not seen the red I got gridlock ultra-white and which pretty good
01:20:57 Yeah, but I'm still red ones hard. I'm still on team red Thunder for life. It's the best. They got the sugar free
01:21:03 It's good. Yeah less than a dollar a can like God intended instead of this three fifty to four dollar
01:21:09 Scalping that dude original does
01:21:12 Straight up super glad to hear you're an Aldi boy. Yeah Aldi Aldi is the shit
01:21:16 You know this is we actually buy quite a bit of Red Bull
01:21:20 I don't drink that much, but like Michelle, and I'll get it fairly really why I
01:21:25 Because it's it was there and we think Red Bull is good, but but now here
01:21:29 There's alternative energy drinks that are cheaper for more red Thunder
01:21:32 I'm looking at his red Thunder. It looks exactly like Red Bull except it was made by like a college student with a design instead of a
01:21:39 Professional, it's like okay. That's like that's like Aldi stick in general. They also have
01:21:44 super cheap
01:21:46 Slim Jim knockoffs. Okay. I bought like
01:21:49 36 of them for like seven dollars super cheap knockoffs of stuff. Yeah, it's the best
01:21:54 It's the best store of all time
01:21:56 Uh, it is the best and a bit and the only the only price you pay is that the place looks really ugly on the inside
01:22:02 And you have to loan them you have to loan them one quarter to use a shopping cart
01:22:08 I fixed that problem too because I got it with Instacart, so I paid three dollars and someone came to my door and gave me everything
01:22:15 That's worth here's the other the other trick about Instacart Tom is that you can get them to shop at like Costco and
01:22:21 BJ's and like places that you need a membership
01:22:23 They will shop at these play at these like bulk places for you and you don't need a membership for it
01:22:28 It's fucking so every time I use Instacart or the other time the whole time well
01:22:31 It says your shopper is now getting though. I go dance puppet dance for me. Oh, yes
01:22:36 Yesterday my cheap goods yesterday
01:22:39 I bought like five pounds of sausage and like big-ass bags of like mozzarella cheese and almond flour from Costco
01:22:44 Normally that would cost me like a hundred dollars or whatever for like a year's membership at Costco. Mm-hmm, and I fucking tricked them
01:22:51 That's this is fantastic. It's amazing. This is capitalism working as intended. All the amazing Instacart fantastic
01:22:57 Yeah, and now I have so much more money. The only thing that sucks about Instacart
01:23:01 It doesn't take my ebt card and then I could totally destroy the system for real. Yeah
01:23:05 Yeah, they don't you have to go it you have to go in person to use
01:23:09 It's because they the delivery fee and stuff doesn't count like you can't pay that with ebt
01:23:13 Yeah, I mean I they would just they would need the card they would need to have your card with them
01:23:20 It's sad sad, but true. I mean, you know, I think you can actually just like withdraw ebt from an ATM
01:23:26 That I'm pretty I haven't I haven't tried it, but I haven't tried it
01:23:33 It does it sure does
01:23:36 But I think it says somewhere in the literature that like you can do it
01:23:40 I think I think there's a different program. There's an ebt cash program
01:23:43 I don't think that's a standard ebt card that is that is different, but um, I'm I don't know
01:23:49 Maybe I'll try it at some point and like get back to you on it
01:23:52 But I think it said that like you can do it even with the food moral the story red thunder brings brings red bull back into the game
01:24:00 Hardcore it's a real competitor now and everybody needs to get on it
01:24:03 I like the system
01:24:04 Yeah, that ebt card issue makes me think that like wouldn't it be more practical if I don't know like maybe like
01:24:09 There's a lot of like, you know, layabouts, you know a lot of a lot of bums a lot of grifters and drifters
01:24:15 Couldn't we just like make them our property and just like give them purpose and have the state and force them sort of
01:24:20 Death explosion collar on them if they don't go get our groceries then we give them our ebt cards
01:24:26 We'll call it a slavery that sounds good and then we'll just you know make that be the system
01:24:32 Seems like
01:24:40 Uh
01:24:41 Well anything else or should we get to the voicemails? I'm down. I'm ready shit up. Let's get to the voicemails
01:24:49 Yeah, Ben. Oh, no, I was thinking about was there something else that we talked about before the show
01:24:54 No, I think it was mage. Yeah, mage asking who is CWC. We're just too many people too many people and I said shut up
01:24:59 Shut up. We'll talk about it on the show and then she left. Yeah
01:25:03 But scared off by our whatever I touched on that whole CWC time for everyone's favorite second
01:25:09 The voicemails now you may be thanking yourself all got a strap in for some really terrible audio content
01:25:15 Well, never fear. I was the one who picked out the voicemails on this one. So we only have five and
01:25:20 Frankly, I'm fine to like skip like this one
01:25:23 I just want to play it because this guy is another like I want to like publicly humiliate him because he's another one
01:25:28 The long string of people who just are I'm gonna do them the pathetics
01:25:32 So this guy's another pathetic who wants to come in here and like guys
01:25:36 How do I be like a baseline like level zero human being?
01:25:41 How do I like understand simple childlike concepts? Please explain to me how I can stop being such a like
01:25:47 Comically bad person. So let's go. Let's go to this guy with this society
01:25:52 You know, I got pretty like big list of friends and I'll like ask one of them to hang out
01:25:57 Uh-huh, and they'll be like, no, I got a girlfriend can't hang out. Sorry
01:26:01 Like I can barely
01:26:02 Logical because he has a fucking girlfriend and then I have another friend who's got like work and that's like, you know
01:26:07 More reasonable, but he's like, oh, I have to work all the time can't can't hang out
01:26:11 Sorry, and like, you know other stuff like that like just friends that are busy like all the fucking time
01:26:16 And I'm so busy with doing nothing like I don't have
01:26:20 Any of that and I just want to hang out with people and I rarely ever can so I gotta make new friends
01:26:27 New friends
01:26:33 Hey, man, you oh, he's still going cut it off cut it off. I've had enough
01:26:38 Look, man, you being an underachieving need is not your friend's burden
01:26:43 That's that's true. Yeah, that's 100 percent. This is sounds like you need a job in a girlfriend
01:26:47 Maybe maybe yeah, you should get a girlfriend yourself and then you too can know the joy of
01:26:53 Of ignoring your other friends of someone. Yeah, the the the best part about having a girlfriend is
01:26:58 Not being not being allowed to see your friend. Yeah, it's having an excuse to not talk to anyone
01:27:05 There's that I think you need to realize that uh, you know
01:27:08 If your friends wanted to hang out with you uh work in your girl and their girlfriends would not be an excuse
01:27:13 We're a hundred percent of the time like it seems to be with you. So it's obvious that you are busy being doing nothing
01:27:20 Obviously you have nothing contribute to them none in terms of monetary or anything like that
01:27:25 But just in terms of you know, you have no personality. You have nothing going for you
01:27:29 It might not be that he has what do you have that is that can supersede their monetary and sexual needs
01:27:37 That's what that's what comes down to uh
01:27:40 Just you gotta
01:27:41 Literally just be cool up your cool level. Just go grind your coolness by doing fun things that people aren't hanging out with you
01:27:48 Actually get an interest and a job or a girlfriend get anything just you know, stop doing nothing like a fucking freak
01:27:55 Why would you think anyone would want to hang out with you? You obviously have no redeeming aspects
01:27:59 Why would you go to the show the fact that you're watching the pcp right now and not slamming a fucking puts into the ground
01:28:05 That's like really upsetting to me and honestly
01:28:07 That's true. I am disappointed at every single one of you listening to this podcast instead of slamming a pus or yeah, that's fair
01:28:14 So this guy society you're going in the voice channel. I fucking hate you. You're another pathetic
01:28:20 You're just another one of the pathetic's lining up speaking of the pathetic's
01:28:24 We got another pathetic following up on his last pathetic display. So come on dance for me pathetic
01:28:28 Oh my god, we really went hard on that poor boy
01:28:31 Hi, I called in last time basically for emotional support because I was anxious about going to a movie alone
01:28:37 Going to see millennia mattress. Oh, right and thankfully might hear a munchie told me to kill myself
01:28:42 I didn't have to go to the movie and uh, maybe I'm used to discover that it was almost all other men who were alone
01:28:48 Who looked basically exactly there you go. There you go. Also millennia mattress
01:28:52 All right, so see we're making a positive different people's lives. Listen, you come on the pcp
01:28:56 You get the tough love you need. I tell you to kill yourself and then your life's fixed
01:29:00 I mean, I think there's no that I think it's just a win-win for everyone
01:29:04 No, it's a three-step process come on the pcb munchie. Tell us to kill yourself. That's it. You're probably solved
01:29:09 You don't clear in your reborn again
01:29:12 So that's I listen, you know, he came on here with like a pathetic like baby tear question
01:29:17 Oh, how do I like exist?
01:29:19 How do I breathe and fucking move my legs to the movie theater to sit down on my fat ass and munch popcorn
01:29:26 And not be scared that people are looking at me. He just did it and it was fine. There was no problem
01:29:30 He had nothing to overcome literally at all. This is what this is what the other guys gotta do
01:29:34 You know, you it's completely fine. You and your friends just hate you just stop being someone who they hate and then you'll be fine
01:29:41 Like it's not a big deal. Yeah
01:29:43 So no more pathetic. Let's give this something like normal people like like something just like a normal thing that like you like a real question
01:29:51 Toot the room other fuckers. No gimmicks or anything. I just got a totally normal ass question for you
01:29:57 What is the most human core thing ever?
01:30:02 Oh
01:30:03 Now I don't want I already know the answer, but I don't want to reveal it right now
01:30:07 Instead, I actually want to see what you guys think it is. Maybe talk about it a little and
01:30:11 I'll get back to you next week and I'll tell you what it is. I know
01:30:16 Only humans do this
01:30:19 Okay, nothing else does it and every human does it. Here's my here's my answer
01:30:25 Applauding in the crowd at a wedding as they just said like I do and everyone's applauding as they kiss
01:30:33 In the in the little thing up there
01:30:36 I've got another one
01:30:39 Uh thanking thanking your bus driver
01:30:42 I'm saying saying thank you when you get off the bus. I have like they did you a favor
01:30:48 I have what I believe to be the answer. I don't think it's going to be his answer
01:30:52 Yeah, but uh
01:30:53 The most the most human core thing that has ever happened is probably the 1980s charity collaboration song
01:31:01 We are the world
01:31:04 Yeah, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. That's very human core
01:31:07 I hadn't gone on their speech about this if you want look I I if I if I remember called the exact number of this
01:31:12 I'm gonna be a fucking genius episode
01:31:14 104 the one where I go to hawaii about sea turtles. Um, but my answer is collectively bread and dogs
01:31:22 Dogs are definitely up. I was thinking like
01:31:24 Bread is a great answer bread is it's a food that we invented. Yeah out of nothing
01:31:30 It's it's it's like an agricultural thing
01:31:32 Which the reason I describe that as human cores because we as humans have gone above what other animals are able to do
01:31:37 We are made able to make agriculture and farm
01:31:39 It's a collective thing and it's just high in dense and calories and we feed it to other people
01:31:43 It's collaborative group effort project the normal bread is like the most
01:31:47 enduring
01:31:49 Thing that is still used today from the dawn of civilization. Yeah, it is civilization
01:31:55 Uh, you find that's it. That's the answer why fix why fix what ain't broken
01:31:59 Uh, he okay. Um, maybe because I'm fucking keto because I've evolved beyond it. I know better
01:32:05 That's true. I mean, that's true
01:32:07 Whatever bread works for for bread does what it's supposed to do. That's true
01:32:12 Okay, I don't know if I agree that bread is human core because to me
01:32:15 What is human core is not simply doing what humans do
01:32:19 It is doing like a it is it is like a
01:32:23 Well, hold on
01:32:25 Okay, I think to me human core is indulging in a human impulse that is uh, never that is detrimental
01:32:34 To two humans actual ends. Well, this goes this goes to I mean this I mean it just depends on our definition here
01:32:40 Just depends on our definition. I don't get human human core. I don't know
01:32:43 It's not being human core to me is not the same thing as simply being human
01:32:48 Well, I don't I don't think I like I say bread just because people eat bread
01:32:53 I say it because I think it's emblematic of like a very like human thing
01:32:57 Which is agriculture and like collaborative eating and and farming and surplus and stuff like that
01:33:02 That's right. Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with those things. Well, I don't think
01:33:07 I mean to me human core is is a derogatory not to me
01:33:11 The most human thing is discussing politics online. There is nothing more deplorable
01:33:17 That's pretty human
01:33:20 And I agree that is very negative
01:33:23 Shit, I had another thing I wanted to bring up the you can do it
01:33:27 I will
01:33:28 human core is like
01:33:30 It's so strange that I can't even like decide on which definition I agree with like really doesn't
01:33:36 It's so vague that I I I can't like I can't even I can't even come up with my own like idea of like what it means to me
01:33:43 To be derogatory or is it meant to be?
01:33:49 When I use it and I invented it so so this is me when I use it, I mean it as
01:33:54 Yes, I did. Okay. No. Well, as we saw ben when you invent something cool
01:33:58 It will be perverted by the world
01:34:02 All right. Well here like like the guy who invented the the gif to try and tell everyone no actually
01:34:08 I always intended it to be pronounced gif
01:34:10 Here's me the the true and the true and honest creator christine weston chandler telling you that human core is an insult
01:34:17 It is not to be used to just describe
01:34:19 Anything that humans do it is it is uh, it is the like the worst human impulses. I mean, I think sneakers are pretty human core
01:34:26 And they're pretty cool
01:34:29 There you have it, you know, my uh
01:34:32 Dita's walk to concrete doors and walks all the concierge floors
01:34:37 Anything that you would be embarrassed of as a human core is is yeah, okay
01:34:41 So if yeah, if you'd be embarrassed of your love of sneakers, no, I'd never be embarrassed of that robot
01:34:46 Something very human core is just being like
01:34:49 Doing nothing in particular than all of a sudden being paralyzed as you remember something cringy you did like 15 years ago
01:34:56 That is pretty. He makes you discuss it. That's human cores. That's true. I'll agree with that
01:35:01 Yeah, I but I guess we'll have to wait for his answer and I hope he has something impressive
01:35:05 I'm sure none of us have said what he was
01:35:08 What was interesting about what he said he said that he said that it's it's super human core and that every human does it
01:35:13 What's up? No, no, no, no, no, he didn't say every yeah, he said only humans do it
01:35:17 No, I don't like though
01:35:18 You know, I don't like he's gonna have a chance to listen to our answers and say like he's gonna be able to change
01:35:23 His secret he didn't like write it down
01:35:26 You're right email it to so we would know what it is. I had a time here's my answer
01:35:30 It's it's episode episode 11 of season six of my little pony
01:35:35 That's human core. That's the most human core thing. Which one is that?
01:35:39 I can't remember and I don't know
01:35:43 Okay, yeah
01:35:44 Hey speaking of my little pony as you all know, we all went to bernie con except for you tom

01:37:07 So
01:37:10 Have you ever you guys ever heard uh
01:37:12 The classic Leonard Nimoy bilbo baggins song where he's like he wrote on a barrel
01:37:18 Uh, he he battled the trolls
01:37:20 He riddled with riddle my ass batman a magic ring. He stole
01:37:25 Yeah, yeah, that's that's that's what my adventure was at at brony con
01:37:30 I did all those things and riddled with riddle my ass batman
01:37:33 If we if we haven't wait, I have I had I remembered one other thing
01:37:36 I wanted to bring up and I should have done it before the voicemail. Okay. All right. No problem
01:37:39 um, did anyone anyone anyone tune into the uh,
01:37:43 Portland protests. I know unaware unaware. I have no idea what that is
01:37:48 You know, it was like anti-fabris of the proud boys or some shit. Yeah, the proud boys is that a real thing?
01:37:54 Yeah, believe it or not the proud boys are some fucking like
01:37:58 Identitarian
01:38:01 I think they would push back against that. Yeah, they would push back against that like any fascist would
01:38:06 Um, they uh, they're well, I mean, okay. They're not all right. They're not all like that
01:38:11 But like they definitely have like like a strong vein of that running through their their bones and their blood
01:38:16 Okay, got it. I don't know the point. Okay. I watched some streams of it yesterday just to see what was going on
01:38:21 It wasn't that interesting
01:38:23 But then afterwards I see fucking idiots on twitter like charlie kirk and andy know and these fucking morons tweeting about like
01:38:30 specifically they're like as a video
01:38:32 Of like a bunch of antifa guys like banging on like a bus that like the proud boy people are like get like these people are
01:38:38 Leaving in a bus and they tweet it with a visual like
01:38:41 Antifa thugs antifa thugs like smashing like like attacking
01:38:46 These these guys with a hammer and there's a video and like yeah one of these antifa guys like has a hammer
01:38:50 And he like breaks one of the wind or he's like swinging it the thing is okay in the video in the exact video
01:38:56 You can see that one of the people on the bus
01:38:59 Brings the hammer out and starts swinging it at the antifa people
01:39:03 Out the bus and one of the antifa people grabs it and pulls it away from him
01:39:08 And it makes me so fucking mad. There's that's the context that seems they're just fucking lying through their teeth
01:39:13 And this is what they do people like like andy know just go out there and just like fine
01:39:18 Just like oh, I gotta I gotta find I gotta find anything that I can frame
01:39:21 Right. I got any fight that breaks out
01:39:23 I got to only film the part where like antifa is fighting and not film whatever happened before it
01:39:27 Put that out there so everyone can see that. Yeah, maybe maybe I'll get maybe I'll get punched
01:39:32 Maybe I'll get punched again and make another two hundred thousand dollars. Mm. Fuck. Yeah
01:39:35 I see your point, but uh
01:39:37 Defending antifa is not a good look and I just associate with this completely
01:39:43 All right, cool. Go how go have fun with being antifascist or being a narco fascist or whatever
01:39:49 I'm over here with antifa and tifa's cool. They've been smeared by the media
01:39:53 Trump's uh, Trump's an asshole. Trump's an asshole calls them a terrorist racist one the cool one
01:39:59 I'm sorry. Who's a terrorist? Who's a trump trump? Yeah, Trump said Trump said antifa is terrorism. Oh, I mean
01:40:07 Aren't they
01:40:08 No, no
01:40:10 No, I mean, I've seen plenty of videos of them like mobbing on old men and beating the shit out of people
01:40:15 I think that's yeah, okay. They've never killed anyone
01:40:25 They've never killed anyone
01:40:26 Yeah, but if you're if you're in a gang and you're assaulting people and beating the shit out of them
01:40:31 Just because you didn't kill them that doesn't mean you're not
01:40:33 Hang on there. The far right fucking shoots up mosques and drives cars into crowds of people
01:40:38 What in news? Are you blaming us for news? Like, sorry, I don't know why I said us. I am not on the far right, but like
01:40:43 In new zeal. That was a new zeal. Yeah, but ben ben. Yeah, that's that's far right extremism
01:40:48 Antifa is far left and they don't kill shortly. They can both be considered terrorism
01:40:53 Yeah, but there's no equivalency
01:40:55 Does there know about that guy? No, it's not no counter protesting is not terrorism. What about that far left?
01:41:00 Elizabeth Warren guy who just shot up in Dayton, Ohio near where I live
01:41:04 Was he far left? Yes. I don't know about that
01:41:07 I wonder I mean, I okay. Look ben. I'm with you. I agreed. There's absolutely lots of people
01:41:12 I'm not even trying to do a both sides or bad thing. I simply think that that every side
01:41:17 Tries to find the most damaging thing about the other because they you know, they've got a team and you know, it seems normal
01:41:24 Yeah, okay. Well, sure. Yeah. Well, the point is that like this video
01:41:28 This thing with a hammer really demonstrates that they will they will smear them. They will like just they'll just lie
01:41:32 Like they've just do you really think that's not a lie never lied or never never like put themselves in a
01:41:39 Better situation than what they actually are. This is just
01:41:42 Political I guess. I mean like yeah, everyone's lying about everyone else. Everyone's trying to play gotcha and just making shit up
01:41:49 That's the way the world is now. I mean just like with confirmation bias
01:41:52 It's the same thing of you only analyze the sit any given situation to get enough detail
01:41:58 To paint your political or idealized opponent as the bad guy and then you stop analyzing the situation
01:42:04 and like we all do that it reminds me is it's like um
01:42:07 When the thing first came out about the uh, the trump hat kids who were supposedly like harassing the indian
01:42:13 And uh, yeah, everyone was against them and then after a while everyone is like, oh no
01:42:17 Here's it from another angle and they were actually harassing the indian
01:42:20 So then everyone, you know, kind of switch sides. You mean the the indian guy was harassing them. Yeah, that's what I meant
01:42:26 They were the indian guy was harassing them and so that but but then even after that
01:42:30 I would see other videos being posted of the kids early in the day
01:42:34 Actually like calling out to people and kind of harassing them. So everyone's bad. Everyone's lying. It's all a big fucking shit show
01:42:42 Everyone should die
01:42:43 Basically, that's why we need fucking either anarchy or fascism either put them all in jail or destroy all laws so that I can kill them
01:42:50 One of the reasons
01:42:51 Yeah, one of the reasons that I personally hate uh, like identifying with any particular group is because I do think like
01:42:57 Everyone is fucked up in their own way including me. I'm no fucking saint and like I'm just aware that when I attach my name to any group
01:43:05 I will be associated with the the negative things about any particular group if I said it was far left
01:43:10 They'll say that I'm a communist and I want to kill like two million
01:43:14 20 million people in russia or whatever if I say I'm far right, they'll say I'm a nazi and I want to kill jews or whatever
01:43:19 Problem, right? Here's here's my problem, right? Antifa is not a centralized organization
01:43:24 They are like a loose coalition of people that show up to counter
01:43:29 Let me let me what do you mean? What is it? What do you mean?
01:43:32 How can you label something like that terrorism that if you label antifa terrorism?
01:43:36 That means like literally any counter protest movement to any far right event is automatically terrorism
01:43:41 If you'd have to examine you don't have to be organized to be a terrorist
01:43:45 Like one dude can just like say wake up like I'm gonna fucking bomb something and it's an act of counter protest is not terrorism though
01:43:52 It's just a counter protest by default isn't but terrorists you can do terrorist acts during a counter protest
01:43:58 It's just so tiring how like everything then at the end of the day antifa bad proud boys bad all of this bad
01:44:06 Oh my god. No, you are totally wrong. Okay. Yeah, there's been violence, right? Fights have broken out people have been punched fine
01:44:14 Yeah, it's not that's not great. That doesn't mean antifa is bad. What they're doing is good because fascism is bad. Okay
01:44:25 Okay, what you're saying you're literally calling for like, oh, don't pro don't protest fascism. No, like don't
01:44:31 Yes, you are. No, that's what it is. No, that's all
01:44:36 That is such a charitable interpretation of what the group is
01:44:40 Well, what do you think it is? I think that's a bunch of people who disagree with the
01:44:45 Right inclinations in the political discourse and go out of their way to make that known and get violent and aggressive
01:44:51 It's just it's it's that's that's only the worst
01:44:54 It's angry people who are lost and confused and sad about their lives and want to fuck shit up
01:44:58 That's all any of the groups are. They're all the fucking literally just people are angry
01:45:04 It's literally just anyone who hates fascism
01:45:06 It's anyone who hates anything anyone who has hate in their heart joins some fucking goofy group and starts fucking shit up
01:45:13 Ben Ben surely you would agree that the definition you're using is the most charitable version of the group
01:45:19 Isn't that fair to say?
01:45:20 Um, I mean, that's what it is though. I mean because you're aware that some people who identify as like the fact like the
01:45:26 Okay, like the like the fact like the fact that some people have died here the fact that some mostly because
01:45:32 Mostly because saying Proud Boys bad Antifa bad is like Ben said a false equivalence Proud Boys are worse
01:45:40 But but why but Antifa is not good
01:45:42 But I don't care who's because their ideology is fuck is a nightmare. They're not but they're okay
01:45:47 Yeah, I don't like when people get killed anyone else
01:45:50 The fact that some people have been punched by Antifa does not mean that Antifa is about punching well Ben
01:45:55 I'm definitely with you in the sense that I don't trust any group of people that are named like a fucking mad max gang
01:46:02 From like the fucking first movie like right before the apocalypse
01:46:06 But it's just so I guess my point is that it's so tiring when everything that you see in here
01:46:13 A week later you see in here that it was actually the opposite and you were lying to and then a week after that you see in here
01:46:18 But no that was the lie and this is the true story. It's just
01:46:21 Nothing is real. Nothing is true anymore
01:46:24 We've killed truth completely
01:46:26 Everything is a fucking slant and a fucking lie and a meme and a joke. So fucking everything is just fucking
01:46:33 Everybody has an agenda or another so there's no way like there's no way to fucking parse through it anymore
01:46:38 There's no strainer to find the truth. It's just impossible. So here's here's here's my here's what I think
01:46:44 Here's what I think. Okay. You got you got two groups, right? You got one that's out there
01:46:49 Promoting an ideology that is about like
01:46:52 Identitarianism, right? Like even if they're not overtly, there's they're supporting there's they support fucking racist policies
01:46:59 Aren't you just they want they want the political overture window to slide even further right towards fascism, right?
01:47:05 Even if they're not overtly fascist themselves, even if they say they're against fascism
01:47:09 Uh, they're doing that and then on the other side you got people that oppose them and don't want that to happen
01:47:14 And even if shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up
01:47:18 And even if both sides were equally violent which they are not but even if they were
01:47:23 I would still say that the that the antifa is better because what they stand for is better
