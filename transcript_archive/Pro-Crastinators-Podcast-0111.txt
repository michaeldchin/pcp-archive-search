00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best
00:00:14 anal hernia ever. Today we're joined by Ben Saint.
00:00:18 No you're not.
00:00:19 You're right. Ben has that title for sure.
00:00:22 And name only or name only. His spirit is left.
00:00:25 Munchy, defend your existence.
00:00:27 Kid power, kid power, kid pride worldwide, kid pride worldwide.
00:00:33 Rise up against your oppressors.
00:00:35 Oh, you guys remember VHS?
00:00:41 No.
00:00:43 The Davoo is here.
00:00:45 I've been in so many podcasts lately that I feel a little bit of bad about being in a giant, empty,
00:00:50 furniture-less room with such a strong echo. So right now I'm in the closet. I don't...
00:00:56 I admire your minimalist lifestyle.
00:00:59 Davoo's never been out of the closet.
00:01:01 Oh, shit. Mage of the lethal variety.
00:01:06 Hello, Mage here, and I'm speaking from my childhood home right now.
00:01:10 Oh, excellent.
00:01:12 Boo to childhood.
00:01:14 You're such a fucking grump today. What's going on, Scrooge?
00:01:18 Shut the hell up, Digibro's here.
00:01:20 I love you.
00:01:22 Gross.
00:01:24 Oh, there's Mage for a second.
00:01:26 This is deeply uncomfortable.
00:01:28 Is that what it used to sound like? Holy shit.
00:01:30 That's what we all used to sound like.
00:01:32 That's awful.
00:01:34 This was the worst entry.
00:01:36 Everyone, look upon your screen, gaze your eyeballs for one split-half of a fucking second,
00:01:41 and look at the number of this episode. This is episode...
00:01:45 One. One. One.
00:01:49 Of the procrastinator's podcast.
00:01:51 Smash one. Smash one in the comments.
00:01:53 Smash that one.
00:01:54 I mean, you know, if you could spare a few, it would really help me out.
00:01:57 If you could find it in yourself to give this old partner a few ones, then you know.
00:02:02 I mean, I would like...
00:02:04 I know where I'll feel, you know, the economy's down and inflation is up, but it's worth it.
00:02:10 To walk down your local vans, you gotta have a bushel or a barrel full of ones,
00:02:16 but you know what, you get to buy your fucking loaf of bread and your apple,
00:02:20 but if you could just spare a one or two, I wouldn't be able to have...
00:02:23 There would be a lot of Patreon percentages and numbers right now.
00:02:26 Do we need to talk about that right now as well?
00:02:28 What?
00:02:29 What about them? What about them?
00:02:30 Isn't, like, aren't we, like, at a very specific number on Patreon?
00:02:35 Is that true?
00:02:36 No, I'm thinking of Twitter.
00:02:37 We've made one, one, one, one, one, one, one.
00:02:38 Oh, yeah, right.
00:02:39 On Twitter.
00:02:40 Guys, it would really do me a big favor if you would all please pledge to our Patreon
00:02:43 so we could get one, one, one, one on there.
00:02:46 That would be great.
00:02:47 That would be great.
00:02:48 But we are at 111 tweets on the PCP, and we're also following 11 people, which is nice.
00:02:55 Excellent. Excellent. Well, there it is.
00:02:58 I haven't gotten past the fact that it's been 11 weeks since Radcon.
00:03:02 If 3,568 people could unfollow us, please, so we could have 11 followers, that would be pretty nice, too.
00:03:09 What'd you say, Digi? It's been so long since Radcon.
00:03:11 I can't believe it's been 11 weeks since Radcon 3, and we've only edited like half the shit.
00:03:15 Episode 100 was there. If we're on 11, then it's been 11 weeks.
00:03:20 It's been 11 episodes.
00:03:21 Oh, right. It's been 11. Is that another?
00:03:23 It's okay. All right.
00:03:25 It's all down to the ones. The ones are the DNA.
00:03:29 If you look down like a microscope down at your DNA, then you'll realize it's actually not a bunch of dots as it's represented in Jurassic Park.
00:03:36 It's actually a bunch of ones.
00:03:37 You know, they say that the world, they say that everything in the world can be represented by ones and zeros,
00:03:42 but no, ones will do just fine. Thank you very much.
00:03:46 Slightly elongated ones will be the zeroes.
00:03:49 I wanted to be with the one that the one could not stare back at me like I stared at it, drove me to madness.
00:03:55 They call me the weird one hermit now.
00:03:58 That weird one hermit.
00:04:00 One weird old hermit.
00:04:02 Contrary to your belief, this is not actually the make ones joke episode. This is the kids episode.
00:04:08 This is childhood kids boyhood took 11 years to make.
00:04:13 Specifically boyhood. Not childhood.
00:04:16 If you can only respond if you're a boy.
00:04:19 If only boyhood took 11 years to make, this joke would work way better.
00:04:23 There you go. Red line is that.
00:04:26 All right. So here we go, everyone. Childhood, being a child, being small and weak and cowardly.
00:04:32 What do you know? What do you say, Ben? What do you say?
00:04:34 It's wrong and it's a sin.
00:04:36 Are there any redeeming qualities to children?
00:04:38 No.
00:04:39 Any.
00:04:40 No.
00:04:41 They're just humans but words.
00:04:42 Jesus Christ.
00:04:43 I'm coming in.
00:04:44 I'm coming in with a fucking wrecking ball.
00:04:46 That's who I'm talking about.
00:04:47 I'm here to beat the shit out of the establishment.
00:04:49 I'm here to shake the ground like a fucking earthquake.
00:04:52 I'm coming in. Hashtag kid power.
00:04:55 I want to see all these tweets tweeting the procrastination with some sort of funny image or relatable quote from a teenager.
00:05:01 Hashtag kid power.
00:05:03 Why don't you grow a fucking brain already?
00:05:06 Why don't you just fucking get your neurons all set up and get set in your ways like the rest of us?
00:05:12 When I was growing up, I mean, we can get into this later.
00:05:15 But when I was growing up, I was always trying to become like a cool ass adult and be mature and like pay taxes and shit.
00:05:21 And now I realize that's stupid.
00:05:22 But not for the usual like, oh, I don't have any, you know, you don't have any responsibilities as a kid.
00:05:27 You don't have to wake up and be like, oh no.
00:05:29 But because adults are fucking lame and they're always pissy baby fucker fappers who shit their fucking diapers.
00:05:34 And as lame and nihilistic as hell, the optimism of the youth is the only valid outlook in the entire world.
00:05:40 Yeah.
00:05:41 That's a strong argument.
00:05:42 It's like basically the kids next door argument, right?
00:05:44 You know what? You're right.
00:05:45 Talk about them all at the moment.
00:05:46 You've changed my mind.
00:05:47 I feel as though this is like, I mean, I know as many, like isn't the stereotype that nihilistic teenagers are the thing.
00:05:55 And then when you grow up, you get past that.
00:05:57 I don't care what the world is outside of my vision.
00:06:00 Teenagers are known adult sympathizers.
00:06:02 That's for sure.
00:06:03 The reputation of adults being boring and cynical comes from the fact that most adults, i.e. most people, are failures.
00:06:09 It's the failure that makes them uninteresting.
00:06:11 Childhood is where childhood is before you've had an opportunity to fail or succeed.
00:06:16 Most people fail, so therefore you can only fail or succeed in adulthood.
00:06:20 Davoo, you're right.
00:06:21 But that's why I don't like children, because like while adults have risen or have failed or succeeded life,
00:06:27 children haven't even put their cards on the table yet.
00:06:30 They're in the waiting room waiting to even give life a try.
00:06:33 The thing about kids generally is that I see him as like not quite cooked chicken.
00:06:43 Like you put them in the oven and you're like, okay, that could do with a few more years.
00:06:47 I'm not going to talk to him.
00:06:49 He's just being a kid. I don't mind.
00:06:51 He's just doing his kid thing and he's not very interesting.
00:06:53 But I'll let him just sit in the oven for a little longer before I go up and try to treat him as a human being.
00:06:59 That's what an oven neighbor did.
00:07:02 All Hitler tried to do was put that childish race in the oven for a little longer,
00:07:05 but he can't catch no breaks for that activity.
00:07:09 That's sort of like, oh, just a kid, I'll let him run around and smear shut on the walls.
00:07:13 That's the reason why kids are bad is because adults won't just treat kids like adults,
00:07:17 which you just said.
00:07:19 Enough of this bullshit. Children are literally worthless.
00:07:22 They rely on adults for everything.
00:07:24 Everything a child is doing has been done by the effort of an adult.
00:07:28 I feel both the way that Munchie and Davoo feel here because on the one hand,
00:07:32 I feel like I take Davoo's stance because I believe what Munchie says,
00:07:36 that you should be really hands-on with a kid because you really need to educate children
00:07:46 in order to make them understand the world around them.
00:07:51 Don't let them just run around and be a dumbass kid.
00:07:53 Try to make them not a kid anymore.
00:07:55 The goal of every kid is to eventually beat the kid out of them and make them a functional human.
00:08:01 But when you see a kid who's not really your business,
00:08:05 and when I see some dumb, bratty kid out and about,
00:08:09 I think of that Boondocks moment where granddad just beats that kid in the grocery store for the lady
00:08:15 and everyone treats him like a hero.
00:08:17 I wouldn't have probably used the same technique,
00:08:19 but I do feel that sense when I see a dumbass kid where I'm like,
00:08:22 man, someone should do something about that,
00:08:24 but I know that if I tried to, it would just get me in trouble.
00:08:27 So I'm just going to be like, you know what, this kid's just not worth worrying about.
00:08:30 They're like fucking dogs.
00:08:32 They're like fucking dogs in the sense that everyone wants a dog,
00:08:35 and then when you have a dog, you're not trained enough to be able to know what to do with it.
00:08:39 You don't want to be like, oh, I don't want to have to spray it with a bottle of water.
00:08:43 That's so fucking cruel.
00:08:45 You only should buy a dog.
00:08:47 You should have to teach it.
00:08:49 You have to be a parent.
00:08:51 You have to teach them what the world is like.
00:08:53 You have to be a parent and be there.
00:08:55 Sorry, but before you get a dog or you get a child,
00:08:57 you should have to sign a contract saying you're willing to put it down if it goes against you.
00:09:01 If it goes against you.
00:09:03 If it goes against you.
00:09:07 You should have to play a game of ski ball
00:09:11 or sign a couple of waivers backwards to be able to legally own it.
00:09:15 Sign waivers backwards?
00:09:17 It's the Ned Stark rule.
00:09:19 This is simultaneously a breathalyzer test and a literacy test at the same time, basically.
00:09:25 Also, it's ski ball.
00:09:27 Listen, when I was a child, I didn't do anything good.
00:09:31 The only things I did that were good.
00:09:33 It's on you, dude. It's on you and your parents.
00:09:35 This is a celebration of Munchie's last gasp of childhood because very soon,
00:09:41 he will be taking that thing they do in Kids Next Door where they brain blast you so you're not a child anymore.
00:09:47 That's literally true.
00:09:49 That's what happens. You forget all the secrets and joy of youth.
00:09:51 That happens when they turn 13, but never mind that.
00:09:55 Is that true?
00:09:57 Yeah, because teens are their own faction.
00:09:59 It's not just Jimmy Neutron.
00:10:01 Jimmy Neutron has a brain blast.
00:10:03 Is it from Johnny Quasar, his lesser-known cousin?
00:10:07 Everyone look up Johnny Quasar.
00:10:09 Do you remember in that one episode, though, here's my counterargument where Santa was proved to just be a super genius
00:10:15 just like Jimmy Neutron and also got brain blasts? Do you remember that?
00:10:19 What? That's so fucking lit, dude. Holy shit.
00:10:23 It's like the next evolution of humanity is those people of the brain blast.
00:10:27 Digi, I know the next podcast we should do.
00:10:29 Jimmy Neutron.
00:10:31 Let's fucking podcast every Jimmy Neutron episode and all the movies.
00:10:35 That's going to be my upcoming podcast. Is it Fleek or is it Gay?
00:10:39 And Santa Claus is definitely going to be Fleek.
00:10:41 Fleek or Gay?
00:10:43 Oh, that's excellent.
00:10:45 Like in Jimmy Newtype.
00:10:47 Jimmy Newtype?
00:10:49 Dude, that's like, is anime now. Incredible, incredible.
00:10:55 You're going to see like transformation from like men to beasts over the course of Chibbaka.
00:10:59 You're going to see us like turn into cavemen.
00:11:01 Dude, you guys should definitely do a Gundam Chibbaka so that I can learn anything about Gundam.
00:11:05 That would be really helpful for me.
00:11:07 I don't want to watch mecha shows. I don't care.
00:11:09 But they're, why?
00:11:11 I don't like robots.
00:11:13 That is inconsequential and ignorant. It has nothing to do with the genre of mecha.
00:11:19 Guren Logan being a mecha.
00:11:21 The name that the robots do is what it says.
00:11:23 Okay.
00:11:25 There's a huge movement going on on any Twitter right now of mecha fans being like,
00:11:29 it's always been about the characters. It's not about the robots.
00:11:31 People are stupid. Nobody understands mecha.
00:11:33 It's a big deal.
00:11:35 Gigi, could you please forgive me because the genre is named mecha?
00:11:39 It's like in the room when Lisa's mom says like marriage has nothing to do with love.
00:11:43 But like put a Naruto headband on her and she said mecha has nothing to do with robots.
00:11:47 Here's the thing about genre labels, right?
00:11:51 Let's say that with metal music, you might like one, like there might be one really great metal band who everyone appreciates.
00:11:57 But then there's like a thousand shitty metal bands and some people will just, because they are categorically a metal fan, listen to all of it.
00:12:05 Mecha's the same way.
00:12:07 There are great mecha anime like Gundam that are not really about Gundam, about robots.
00:12:11 Every good story is about human characters.
00:12:13 Exactly.
00:12:15 There was going to be no good mecha.
00:12:17 Speaking about mecha and the human heart conflict with itself.
00:12:21 Give, save us, save us, give.
00:12:23 Speaking about childhood now, because that's the thing, and mecha, I had robot toys.
00:12:31 Which toys did we have and what did we do?
00:12:35 I was post-toy. I'm so young that I was post-toy.
00:12:41 Feeling that too, that's interesting.
00:12:43 Toys are not really, nobody gives a fuck, because you had more advanced things.
00:12:49 Speaking of mechas, Ben and I did have all the megazords that we got for all the years that we cared, and I had a ton of transformers.
00:12:57 I never had that many transformers.
00:12:59 I had the exact same toys as you guys. I also was Power Rangers and then Beast Wars.
00:13:05 I guess the only transforming toy I had was a Digimon toy that evolved quote-unquote.
00:13:13 Which Digimon was that?
00:13:15 In Lithuania, they only had go-bots.
00:13:19 Who was? I want to know.
00:13:21 I think it's called Hawkmon and it evolved into the Armored Digivolution of it.
00:13:25 Oh, I think I had that.
00:13:27 You flipped up a skull and then you turned it upside down and it became like a metal skull.
00:13:34 You put a thing on it and then you expanded its wings and into the wings you put in legs.
00:13:41 It also opened up and you had a little mini world inside of it with a little mini Digimon.
00:13:48 That was really cool.
00:13:50 Speaking of Digimon and childhood, is Digimon still good?
00:13:54 Some people have told me that it got good again or something.
00:13:59 Digimon Tri was good.
00:14:01 A couple of them have their defenders.
00:14:04 Nate, here's what you have to do. You have to Google search Digimon, look at the monster designs.
00:14:09 Do you like them? Digimon is good.
00:14:11 I couldn't tell if he was asking, is the new show good?
00:14:15 And the question is, look at any screenshot of it and you'll be like, I'm not watching that.
00:14:21 That's how I felt about it.
00:14:22 Is it the one with the mobile one?
00:14:24 It looks really bad.
00:14:26 It's one of the mobiles.
00:14:30 No, not that one.
00:14:32 That was an actual child Digimon show.
00:14:35 This is a different thing.
00:14:37 Whatever, we don't need to get a good Digimon thing.
00:14:40 Digimon sucks.
00:14:41 Let me tell you an anecdote from my childhood.
00:14:44 I remember one time, I don't remember why this happened but I got sent to the school guidance counselor
00:14:50 because I was in distress about something.
00:14:53 And who cares?
00:14:55 And I remember going to the guidance and she sat me down and was talking to me
00:15:01 and I remember in hindsight that I ended up just sitting down and talking to my guidance counselor
00:15:06 for a long time about how hard it was for me to decide whether I liked Pokemon or Digimon better.
00:15:13 I remember I did a school write whatever kind of essay that you want.
00:15:20 Not an essay, but a short story in 6th grade or whatever.
00:15:23 And I wrote mine in the style of Homestuck and I had to explain to my teacher what Homestuck was.
00:15:27 I can't believe Homestuck was Munchies childhood.
00:15:32 You know what?
00:15:33 That is weird.
00:15:34 It makes sense though, doesn't it?
00:15:36 Think about Homestuck and look at me.
00:15:38 There is definitely one thing about being a child that is a huge advantage over being an adult
00:15:45 is that adults will never get it.
00:15:47 Children, they get it.
00:15:49 That's literally true, that's literally what I believe that is true.
00:15:57 I feel very much so that occasionally a new thing will come up and people are saying like a word
00:16:03 and I'm like well now I guess I'm an adult because I don't get it.
00:16:06 When Munchies said fleek before, I had a fucking crisis.
00:16:09 I know, I don't say fleek, I said it because it's retarded.
00:16:13 The funny thing about that Ben is that fleek is an old ass slang too.
00:16:19 It's not even in anymore, it's like already out.
00:16:23 I said in the context of a podcast being called is it fleek or is it gay?
00:16:28 I don't actually use the term fleek to describe things.
00:16:31 That was what made it so funny to me is that it's like an already dead slang
00:16:34 but it's funny that Ben had never even heard of it.
00:16:37 My girlfriend is five years younger than me.
00:16:39 But I don't get it because I'm an adult and adults will never get it.
00:16:42 My girlfriend is five years younger than me and she continually refers to hitting the whip
00:16:46 and I have no fucking idea what she's talking about.
00:16:49 What does this mean?
00:16:52 A car is a whip so she probably means go to the car.
00:16:55 Does it mean go for a drive?
00:16:58 No, it's like a dance move or something that I don't understand or comprehend.
00:17:02 Well I don't know anything about dance moves.
00:17:05 This is a bunch of white dudes trying to talk about what is probably an urban dance culture.
00:17:11 An urban dance culture is an urban one.
00:17:16 Come right out and say it, coward.
00:17:19 Alright guys, let's get down to brass tacks here.
00:17:22 I want to hear retarded stories of how you fucked up as children.
00:17:25 That's what I want to hear about.
00:17:26 I've never done it before.
00:17:28 The only time I've ever fucked up is never.
00:17:31 I was trying to think about it but I couldn't do it.
00:17:34 I remember when you fucked up when you didn't carry the monsters podcast.
00:17:38 That's true.
00:17:40 I didn't carry it.
00:17:43 I have a better question for everybody.
00:17:45 I want to know, when you were kids, did you want to grow up?
00:17:49 No.
00:17:52 I have a big story about that.
00:17:54 It's a good question.
00:17:56 I want to hear Monty's big story but me and Nate you go first and then I'll go.
00:18:00 I was just going to say yes.
00:18:02 I reached that at a certain point because of the deep frustration.
00:18:07 Teenagers just want to be able to drive.
00:18:09 They want to be able to do stuff.
00:18:11 That's not true.
00:18:12 It took me years before I fucking got the motivation.
00:18:15 Even Millennial Childs are post-cards.
00:18:18 Millennial Childs are post-cards.
00:18:20 I wanted to be an adult because I wanted to be able to do stuff and seize control of the destiny of my life.
00:18:27 The reason I wanted to be a kid is that I wanted to relinquish control and not have to think about anything.
00:18:35 I just wanted to not be responsible.
00:18:37 Who wants to be responsible for stuff?
00:18:39 I do so I can run my life and win at life.
00:18:43 A lot of my relationship with seeing myself as not wanting to grow up was that I really hated this idea that everyone supposedly was going to grow up.
00:18:55 People would always tell me you're not going to care about toys when you're an adult.
00:18:59 You're going to care about girls once you're an adult.
00:19:03 All those things would piss me off because I was like you can't tell me.
00:19:06 Literally all of them happened.
00:19:08 I remember the day when I could not bring myself to care about toys anymore.
00:19:14 They said you won't care about toys but then I look up from my computer and I see more anime figurines.
00:19:21 I'm already over anime figurines.
00:19:23 I don't even like them.
00:19:24 I keep them somewhere else in the house where I don't have to look at them.
00:19:27 I had a similar attitude of whenever people told me when you're this age you're going to be like this.
00:19:35 Maybe you're not going to fucking decide.
00:19:38 I will decide what I would like.
00:19:40 I will make those decisions.
00:19:41 Thank you very much.
00:19:42 I had similar experiences.
00:19:48 When I was younger I had people tell me when you grow up you're going to grow out of those Pokemon.
00:19:55 You're going to get a job and not draw anymore.
00:19:59 You're going to start caring about things, other things.
00:20:04 And I'm like no.
00:20:06 And there I am liking Pokemon and drawing pretty equal split.
00:20:11 It's always a pretty equal split of things that you have grown out of and also things that you've retained interest in.
00:20:16 Like a lot of the shit that like I wasn't really told that I would grind a lot of things other than the fact that I would probably mellow out.
00:20:23 Which I think a lot of it.
00:20:26 For what it's worth you have mellowed out considerably.
00:20:29 It's true.
00:20:30 It's just that Munchy has mellowed out from like Christ consciousness levels way above like human comprehension to something we can see on the visible spectrum.
00:20:38 Oh you're making me sad dude.
00:20:40 No, no Munchy.
00:20:41 Don't be sad.
00:20:42 It's like Munchy is like a prism that light of the universe is shining through.
00:20:46 But you've refined yourself to be a more focused beam.
00:20:50 Yeah I would say that.
00:20:51 I would give my take on you to say something around the same time I did I think.
00:20:55 MLP reviewer give and take?
00:20:57 Please tell us.
00:20:59 I had to hurry and be called that in full.
00:21:01 Oh sorry.
00:21:02 It's in my head I was supposed to give.
00:21:04 No one told you that name.
00:21:07 I haven't been called.
00:21:08 I haven't heard that name in years.
00:21:10 I'm sorry.
00:21:12 I've been trying to think of my childhood and it's strange that I can't really remember what people were talking about like to me.
00:21:21 Like you know I don't remember things that I was told as a kid necessarily.
00:21:25 I just remember like general feelings of stuff that it was good.
00:21:30 It was good when stuff happened and I want to have that again.
00:21:35 But then you know I guess I just have a bad memory.
00:21:40 I'm not coming up with it.
00:21:42 I'm coming up with like brands like Bionicle and Beyblade and fucking Bugslide.
00:21:47 I define myself exclusively with brands.
00:21:50 I just want to slam back my total quality.
00:21:53 I don't remember what like I was like as a kid and whether I wanted to grow up or not.
00:21:58 I distinctly remember as a teenager looking around at people like getting driving licenses and cars and being still teenagers you know at school but like acting adults and they had suits.
00:22:14 I mean they had school uniforms but they would like you know like I'm cool because I wear this suit thing.
00:22:20 It's kind of like a suit.
00:22:22 It's like I being a creative person.
00:22:26 Yes I don't know what that means.
00:22:30 I distinctly remember feeling an aversion to being an adult in the way that they were doing it.
00:22:37 Like I believe you could be an adult and still be a kid because it's more fun that way.
00:22:42 Like just to be into stupid shit because even if it doesn't mean you're popular it's still cool because you like it.
00:22:50 That's all I can really remember about like childhood yearnings of adulthood.
00:22:54 I remember a lot of cartoons at the time for female specifically were all about fashion and makeup and stuff.
00:23:02 And I had like a very sort of distinctive version to them because I never got into makeup and fashion.
00:23:08 I still haven't and it's always bothered me.
00:23:12 I sort of tolerated the ones that had something else to do like as ashamed as I admit it.
00:23:18 I did like Winx because it had magic not just like fashion and stuff.
00:23:22 Winx was lit yo.
00:23:24 I didn't like the pressure.
00:23:26 Like one of the reasons I didn't want to grow up as well.
00:23:28 I didn't like the pressure of having to dress nice and put on makeup and think about all those things.
00:23:33 I just got damn patriarch.
00:23:35 He's trying to keep you down.
00:23:37 Fuck that.
00:23:39 But before I get into, I should get into my big old story about how it became the boy that you see before you.
00:23:46 The big baby boy.
00:23:47 Himself, right.
00:23:48 I would like to say to Mage, is it true that being a woman is awful?
00:23:52 Not in the sense like it's bad, but in the sense like you do so much shit just like on the reg.
00:23:57 That does seem to be true.
00:23:58 That would seem awful.
00:23:59 I don't.
00:24:00 I don't do it.
00:24:01 I'm purple.
00:24:02 I'm not a female.
00:24:03 Well that's tough.
00:24:04 Mage has taken the Ben approach of just shirking all societal expectations.
00:24:08 You live in the alternative lifestyle.
00:24:10 Yeah, if you just live an alternative lifestyle and become a weird hermit, no one expects anything of you and you don't have to do anything.
00:24:16 I want to see fan art of Ben living his alternative lifestyle.
00:24:20 Just in whatever way you imagine that, please.
00:24:22 That could mean any number of things.
00:24:24 It could mean anything.
00:24:26 There's no definition for what that means.
00:24:30 It could be literally anything.
00:24:32 You have a question though guys.
00:24:33 How are you different from your child self?
00:24:38 I was pretty similar as a child.
00:24:42 I was a little more of a spaz and I cared about things more and I'm embarrassed of that in hindsight.
00:24:48 You care about things very, very slightly.
00:24:50 I cared about what was going on around me and that was a mistake.
00:24:55 Oh yeah.
00:24:57 You've turned into a fucking adult, dude.
00:24:59 You've turned into an adult and you're no longer hashtag relatable to me, a child.
00:25:04 We walk around and things happen around me and I'm going to turn around.
00:25:08 Oh, look at that.
00:25:09 Who cares?
00:25:11 Now the bombs drop around Ben everywhere and he doesn't even deign to look at it.
00:25:17 When Donald goes drunk, Ben's not even going to realize.
00:25:20 He's going to be living in a Trump-style society, not realizing it's gone full drunk on him.
00:25:25 Being straight, white, cis, male, I won't even notice the difference, no.
00:25:29 When the bombs fucking drop, his pristine, pasty, white condition will make him immune to all radiation.
00:25:36 So regarding the question of difference between childhood and desire to grow up,
00:25:40 for me, I can answer both with one line.
00:25:43 I am 100% goal focused since my conception.
00:25:49 I can remember what you...
00:25:51 Please continue.
00:25:54 I've never heard that exact sentence before.
00:25:57 I'm sorry.
00:25:59 I don't.
00:26:00 I don't, but what do you mean?
00:26:02 Many of my earliest memories is me thinking what will be my...
00:26:07 All I would do as a kid is just think of overarching lifetime plans for something, right?
00:26:16 I imagine if I had grown up in an engineer family or had an inventor dad and mom,
00:26:22 I probably would have gotten into engineering.
00:26:24 Like if I had an actual social life, you know?
00:26:28 If I had been the fucking child of some sort of internet content creator or some shit,
00:26:33 I would have just gotten onto YouTube way earlier, right?
00:26:36 So I didn't really care about growing up or not growing up.
00:26:40 I just wanted to have a purpose.
00:26:42 And so the difference between myself then and now is that I do have a purpose and plenty of goals.
00:26:48 Before that, I was just totally aimless not knowing what to do with myself.
00:26:52 I also had no purpose or goal in life as a kid.
00:26:58 That's pretty much what I was going to say too, for mine.
00:27:00 I'm way more disciplined now when I do what I want to do.
00:27:03 I guess in college I had a vague idea that I was going to go to grad school and become a physicist.
00:27:08 So I guess I had a goal at some point.
00:27:11 Like personality-wise, were you similar or different from how you are now?
00:27:18 I think right now the me that exists now is more like my self as a child
00:27:24 than the me that existed as a teenager in my early 20s.
00:27:29 Completely dependent on others around you.
00:27:32 You're very much like yourself as a teenager in certain specific ways.
00:27:38 You're an absolutist is what you are and you always have.
00:27:44 I am now, that's for sure.
00:27:46 Well, fair enough.
00:27:48 You've expressed it in different ways before.
00:27:51 The biggest difference between me as a kid and now is that
00:27:57 really the biggest difference for me, I don't think I was very different from childhood through adulthood.
00:28:02 It's more like after becoming a brony celebrity I changed
00:28:05 because I became able to talk to people and be social.
00:28:09 I think that I act very differently now from how I did in 2012.
00:28:15 But 2012 me was almost exactly the same person as 2-year-old.
00:28:20 I remember videos of you in 2012 saying,
00:28:23 Man, I was never knowing how to talk to people until the last couple of years.
00:28:27 I'm just expecting another update to this in 3 years saying,
00:28:30 I wasn't able to talk to people until 2017.
00:28:33 I would say that my perception of what I meant by a sentence like that changed a lot.
00:28:39 When I said able to talk to people then I probably meant at all.
00:28:43 Whereas now I mean I can socially go out and start conversations with strangers.
00:28:50 Becoming a very mildly successful internet art person.
00:28:57 Achieving a little bit of success in that arena has changed me.
00:29:01 Went straight to Ben's head. He's a broken man.
00:29:04 Yeah, well basically. It has changed me in ways that are probably net negatives.
00:29:10 Because I have found ways to survive and to buy without interacting with anyone.
00:29:19 And I have leaned into that.
00:29:21 And I think I need to choose. Am I going to get my life on track and find a balance?
00:29:27 Or am I just going to get my life on track and find a balance?
00:29:31 Or am I just going to lean into it and completely become a hermit, a hermit, nothing master?
00:29:36 As we all know, as much as I already was going to do my thing right after him.
00:29:41 I still want to answer the question myself.
00:29:44 I just think it's funny that Ben would accuse himself of not interacting with people.
00:29:49 Because the way that you do your career involves extensive social networking.
00:29:54 Twitter doesn't count.
00:29:55 What about Discord? You run several of them.
00:29:59 It's all baby shit. It's literal baby shit compared to talking to people in person.
00:30:03 We all know that internet friends aren't real friends, am I right?
00:30:07 Of course.
00:30:09 Growing up, this is also, again, I'm post toys and I'm also post friends.
00:30:16 Because growing up, I basically only had internet friends.
00:30:19 So there's no real distinction to me.
00:30:21 There's no difference really between me going down the street and talking to someone online,
00:30:26 like emotional wise.
00:30:28 I don't feel any differently.
00:30:30 I feel the same as how you described.
00:30:32 The lines of the meat and the wired, bro.
00:30:34 I have to back up.
00:30:36 I do interact with people.
00:30:38 What? No.
00:30:39 She said her audacity crashed.
00:30:41 What? Oh, oh.
00:30:43 Oh no, technical difficulties.
00:30:46 Mage fucked up.
00:30:48 But it's okay. We came back.
00:30:51 Okay, Ben was saying something. Feel free to pick it up.
00:30:54 Was I?
00:30:55 Alright, if you can't remember, who cares?
00:30:58 The thing we were on, the thing we were on currently was how do you feel different
00:31:04 between being a child and being an adult?
00:31:06 And I haven't gone yet and Mage hasn't gone yet.
00:31:08 Okay, well if you guys just want to grab it, I mean, go for it.
00:31:11 Yeah, I wanted to say that the difference between me as a child and me now is mostly,
00:31:18 like my sense of humor is basically exactly the same.
00:31:21 And all of the things I like are like, you know, I still love all the things I liked as a kid.
00:31:26 YouTube poops.
00:31:27 Yeah, fuck it. I love YouTube poops.
00:31:29 Pooping while watching YouTube, you know.
00:31:31 They're very, very good.
00:31:33 But like the difference is like, I've become more confident, which is obviously good.
00:31:39 And like being able to get over depression is another thing that I've just, through like the amount of times it's happened.
00:31:47 The amount of times he's died in Dark Souls is really hard to give to getting over depression.
00:31:53 But like, in terms of like not having like a focus as a kid, like I never knew what I wanted to do.
00:32:00 I always had multiple passions and multiple skills that were good and people would praise me at multiple skills.
00:32:06 What a humble brain.
00:32:07 Which one?
00:32:08 Yes. No, no, no, this is a good thing, but it's like it causes a problem because when you are good as a kid at multiple things
00:32:17 and you're praised equally, you don't know what you should do.
00:32:21 And I had like no focus and I would never actually got like very good at any one thing.
00:32:27 Hippo was like Ebony Darkness Dimension Raven Way. He was too talented and everyone hated him.
00:32:32 I was too talented to succeed. But the thing I've learned, the thing that changed like a few years ago
00:32:40 is that I just realized you don't fucking need a focus. You don't need to know what you're doing.
00:32:45 You just need to do stuff and then you'll die and then people will pre-sit together for you.
00:32:53 You just have to start doing stuff.
00:32:55 I didn't die.
00:32:56 Is that what you're getting at?
00:32:57 Yeah.
00:32:58 No, just kill yourself.
00:33:00 I didn't mean it like that.
00:33:03 You'll die.
00:33:04 I think what you're saying is that like you don't, even if you don't know what your end goal is,
00:33:10 you can't like wait until you know what it is.
00:33:13 Yeah.
00:33:14 Oh yeah.
00:33:15 The best thing is just to not...
00:33:16 You are dying right now.
00:33:17 Yeah.
00:33:18 If you don't know what you're doing, like I didn't know what I was doing and I was agonizing over what I should get into,
00:33:23 what I should forge ahead with.
00:33:26 I just realized that it's just a big waste of time and anxiety, right?
00:33:31 Just to even think about it.
00:33:32 It's like people that are like, I'm going to start writing my book.
00:33:35 I'm going to start drawing my comic or whatever, but I'm going to like flesh out the world.
00:33:39 I'm going to spend like weeks and months and years just like writing notes,
00:33:43 fleshing out the world and it has to be complete before I actually start.
00:33:46 This is even worse.
00:33:47 This is the tip that you hear when I talk about...
00:33:52 I was just going to say my webcomic site, apsadventures.site,
00:33:57 is like exactly this whole like, it doesn't matter how good it is.
00:34:02 I'm just happy that I'm making it and it's cool.
00:34:04 That's what Beast Capades was.
00:34:07 I just started it with no real plan.
00:34:09 That's great.
00:34:10 And the plan developed.
00:34:11 Giv, could you please explain to me the origin of Pumpk?
00:34:14 Is it just like your avatar was the pumpkin?
00:34:17 In fucking Inktober 2016, I think, I was just like, I'll just draw because I wanted to get...
00:34:25 I always want to get better at drawing.
00:34:27 Inktober is an excuse.
00:34:29 I drew like one thing on the first day and then on the second day I drew a pumpkin girl
00:34:33 and I was like, dude, fucking sick.
00:34:36 And I really like...
00:34:37 More like Plumpk.
00:34:39 Got him.
00:34:40 Got him.
00:34:41 Good.
00:34:44 Please draw Plumpk, everyone.
00:34:46 We need Plumpk to fan art.
00:34:48 No, we do.
00:34:50 I'm really happy, by the way, that I invented the pun Gordjus, because she's a Gordjus.
00:34:58 Yeah, she's gorgeous.
00:35:01 Anyway, yeah, that was the origin.
00:35:04 I just drew it and then I took it into a comic.
00:35:06 You don't need to start off with a grand plan for your whole life.
00:35:08 And that's actually one of the good things about adulthood, if you can get yourself functional,
00:35:11 is that you either have to get a job or you're allowed to be in need, which is depressing in itself.
00:35:16 So let that be the motivation for your first initial goal.
00:35:19 Make yourself, at least relatively independent,
00:35:23 you know, by funding your life through some form of art, any form of art.
00:35:27 I would not have gotten onto YouTube, by the way,
00:35:29 if I could have made just as much money doing anything else within the same timeframe.
00:35:34 But I got onto YouTube because it was the thing I liked the most
00:35:37 that I felt most plausible in being able to make money from.
00:35:41 I feel like there's something there. I feel like there's something there into that,
00:35:44 because I, too, I felt like my approach to, like, YouTube content specifically...
00:35:48 I still want to go ahead and answer the question, by the way.
00:35:51 You certainly will get one, mate. Just let me...
00:35:53 I just want to respond to this point directly.
00:35:55 It was just, like, there's something there of, like, when you're a child,
00:35:59 it's like you live in sort of a fantasy world of possibilities.
00:36:02 And, like, for me, that was, like, making big, like, best anime ever and, like, nothing else
00:36:07 and just taking as long as it took to get those done.
00:36:09 But adulthood is more of, like, you selectively cut off avenues
00:36:15 that are not practical and, like, you intentionally limit yourself
00:36:20 or you give yourself a more pragmatic way to survive,
00:36:23 which is what I've done with, like, Miyamafa and Wiago and stuff.
00:36:26 It's just an excuse to make content as kind of an acceptance that, like,
00:36:31 okay, it's true, like, I can't actually survive
00:36:34 just making crazy, big old projects every six months.
00:36:37 It won't work.
00:36:39 So, Michelle...
00:36:41 I just had the same reaction.
00:36:44 I assume people who just heard about Pearl Harbor being bombed had.
00:36:48 So you're saying that Wiago is going to be, like, your only content now?
00:36:51 Like, that's what's gonna happen?
00:36:53 Absolutely not.
00:36:54 Okay.
00:36:55 Wiago has always been.
00:36:56 Wiago is a means to an end.
00:36:58 It is a support structure, a scaffolding,
00:37:01 upon which I can build my more complex projects.
00:37:05 That's what it is.
00:37:06 Do not fear, people. Do not fear.
00:37:08 Go to Michelle eventually.
00:37:10 Okay.
00:37:11 2030.
00:37:12 Okay, okay, wait.
00:37:13 As for me, I feel like in some ways I'm sort of the same person,
00:37:19 but there's definitely a big difference of how I used to be as a kid
00:37:23 and how I am now.
00:37:25 I'm specifically talking about my preteen years,
00:37:28 so, like, legit a kid, like, 11, 12, 11, and younger.
00:37:32 So we're illegitimately a kid in faith.
00:37:35 No, no, like, you know, when you say a kid,
00:37:37 sometimes people, you know, think 14, 16 and stuff.
00:37:40 I mean, I'm talking about, like, a childhood deer, you know, like a kid, like an animal.
00:37:44 Everyone under 30 is a kid to me.
00:37:46 Yeah.
00:37:47 Well, I mean, you're just 29, but I'm wicked and nihilistic and cool and under.
00:37:51 I turn 30 in April, you cuck.
00:37:53 That's right, I forgot.
00:37:55 Ben is gay.
00:37:56 Ben says cuck now, guys.
00:37:57 Let Mage go so I can make fun of Ben more after she's done,
00:38:00 and I won't feel bad about cucking off Mage.
00:38:02 Indeed.
00:38:03 Yes, okay.
00:38:04 So, yeah, when I was a kid, I was very extroverted, I'd say.
00:38:08 I, my mom had to lay, for years, she had to teach me not to greet strangers,
00:38:13 because in my mind, I was like,
00:38:15 oh, hey, a person, I should greet them,
00:38:17 because that's the polite thing to do.
00:38:18 So I would greet people, even random strangers on the street,
00:38:21 and she had to teach it out of me for several years,
00:38:25 because I refused, because that was rude.
00:38:27 How can you not greet someone when you see them,
00:38:29 when you make eye contact?
00:38:30 You must greet them.
00:38:32 Break that curiosity and friendliness out of your child right now,
00:38:35 beat that shit out of them,
00:38:36 make sure they're scared to communicate with other humans.
00:38:38 That's the way to go.
00:38:39 Yeah.
00:38:40 I wasn't scared of people like at all.
00:38:42 I, like I said, I'd greet them,
00:38:44 and I would fight other kids as well.
00:38:46 Like Dragon Ball Z was a big thing,
00:38:48 but even before Dragon Ball Z, I would like fight people,
00:38:51 either for fun or just...
00:38:54 Majors fighting people before Dragon Ball Z made it cool, you guys.
00:39:00 The thing is, I'm gonna, I'm getting to it,
00:39:02 but yeah, like Dragon Ball Z did, did make fighting cool.
00:39:05 We had like the sort of like, I'd say like,
00:39:08 it's almost like a roleplay.
00:39:09 We all assigned names of the characters,
00:39:11 and I was, was it K-18, I think?
00:39:14 The girl, the cyborg, the girl one, the blonde one.
00:39:17 Android 18.
00:39:18 Yeah.
00:39:19 She was called K-18, I think.
00:39:21 But yeah.
00:39:22 Oh, okay.
00:39:23 Yeah, so I was assigned that name,
00:39:25 and we would like sort of play fight,
00:39:27 but the fighting was, I mean...
00:39:28 But the fighting was real,
00:39:29 and the bruises were all too real.
00:39:32 Yes, yes, and we would legit fight.
00:39:35 I would, I would take on the guys,
00:39:38 the guys stronger than me, like bigger than me.
00:39:40 Oh, yeah.
00:39:41 I once almost won against like a teenager,
00:39:44 when I was like, I think 10,
00:39:46 but he cheated, he had to cheat to win against me,
00:39:49 to win against a little girl.
00:39:51 I'm sorry about that, but I'll wait till you're done.
00:39:53 Bring it back to team fighting,
00:39:55 because this is a big thing.
00:39:57 Yeah, it was snowing, he used snow against me,
00:40:00 and that's how he was.
00:40:02 That's not true.
00:40:03 That's not true.
00:40:04 Pocket sand is real sanction.
00:40:05 I want to like, acknowledge the like,
00:40:07 weird like cultural prejudice I have,
00:40:10 because we're just like, what do you call it?
00:40:13 The privilege goggles.
00:40:15 Whenever you talk about being a childhood
00:40:17 in your home country,
00:40:18 I just imagine Lithuania is like,
00:40:20 this like bombed out third world nation
00:40:22 with like maybe like two streets,
00:40:23 and it's all color coded,
00:40:25 just like mage's avatar, it's all purple.
00:40:27 I just imagine that every time.
00:40:29 And everyone's fighting on this town.
00:40:31 Think of cop kill town, look at that.
00:40:33 Yeah, exactly like it.
00:40:35 Cathedral's everywhere.
00:40:37 I mean, you're not completely wrong.
00:40:39 It's very popular.
00:40:41 No, it's terrible.
00:40:42 I mean, I grew up.
00:40:43 A lot of dead cops in Lithuania, a lot of dead cops.
00:40:46 I grew up in post USSR.
00:40:48 Lithuania, there were like a lot of Russians
00:40:50 around a lot of chaos, I'd say.
00:40:53 Oh, God.
00:40:55 I grew up with like, sometimes no electricity
00:40:59 and brown running water and stuff.
00:41:01 Oh, God.
00:41:02 I thought you were going to be like,
00:41:04 no, it wasn't that bad.
00:41:06 Yeah, me too.
00:41:08 Mage is a feral child.
00:41:10 I know.
00:41:11 I was.
00:41:12 I would run around barefoot.
00:41:13 And your anime wasn't even dubbed right.
00:41:15 Yeah.
00:41:17 When I was a kid, I ran around barefooted
00:41:20 and wielding knives.
00:41:22 It's like cop kill town.
00:41:25 It's like Neo Milwaukee.
00:41:27 Just kids running around with like weapons.
00:41:29 You would feel right at home in Slime City.
00:41:32 You would feel right at home.
00:41:34 I have to say, for years, up until this very moment,
00:41:37 anytime we talked about Lithuania,
00:41:39 that was the picture I was getting,
00:41:41 but I thought that's clearly me projecting like,
00:41:43 oh, God.
00:41:45 It's a lot better now.
00:41:47 Okay.
00:41:49 Only adults run around the streets naked with knives.
00:41:51 That's the only way.
00:41:53 My neighborhood was terrible as well.
00:41:55 I heard rumors.
00:41:57 Okay, I did see drunk people stumbling about,
00:41:59 but I did hear rumors about people using drugs
00:42:03 and stuff and selling drugs around.
00:42:05 I was disgusted.
00:42:07 I saw some weird nasty people,
00:42:09 but I never really saw them and thank goodness I didn't.
00:42:12 I did see discarded needles here and there,
00:42:14 but that's beside the point.
00:42:16 Anywho.
00:42:18 Nice.
00:42:20 Yeah, back to happy childhood times when I was a good kid.
00:42:24 Yeah, so, yeah, like I would fight.
00:42:26 Silence.
00:42:28 Yeah, I would fight people.
00:42:30 I wasn't scared to pick fights with people.
00:42:32 I think my record is like two bloody noses.
00:42:36 Wow.
00:42:38 What about now, mate?
00:42:40 You looking to start some shit?
00:42:42 I feel like you got shortchanged in the Royal Rumble.
00:42:44 Yeah, I was going to say, yeah.
00:42:46 I would like to put a call out to the fan artists.
00:42:50 I want somebody to draw feral little mage
00:42:52 with dual-wielding knives in the purple streets.
00:42:54 Yeah, wait.
00:42:56 Bomb down to the streets.
00:42:58 How would you become the funny,
00:43:00 like girl-like,
00:43:02 girl-like,
00:43:04 girl-like,
00:43:06 girl-like,
00:43:08 the funny,
00:43:10 girl-timid,
00:43:12 draw-fan-art girl.
00:43:14 That's the power of fucking artistic expression.
00:43:16 We're all speaking the same language of
00:43:18 fluffy tumblr shit,
00:43:20 but then we have
00:43:22 totally different people from totally different fucking worlds.
00:43:24 It kind of blows my mind every time I hear shit like that.
00:43:30 You were always kicking people's asses,
00:43:32 but you were still like this?
00:43:34 No.
00:43:36 I was still generally good natured.
00:43:38 Like,
00:43:40 the very first job that I wanted to have
00:43:42 that I remember was a veterinarian,
00:43:44 but then I learned what a veterinarian had to do
00:43:46 and then I was like,
00:43:48 my stomach's weak. I almost fainted the first time
00:43:50 we took our cat to the veterinarian.
00:43:52 So that dream died quick.
00:43:54 And
00:43:56 whenever me and my friends were bored,
00:43:58 I would get these schemes on how to help
00:44:00 the environment and nature and stuff.
00:44:02 It wasn't because the TV told me so.
00:44:04 Hey, you know what would be fun?
00:44:06 If we would take these brooms and take these rakes
00:44:08 and clean up the neighborhood.
00:44:10 That'd be a fun project for the day.
00:44:14 You know, Mage, that reminds me.
00:44:16 There's a story my mom tells me about
00:44:18 me as a child.
00:44:20 She was taking me to
00:44:22 summer camp and I was like,
00:44:24 oh, I don't want to go.
00:44:26 I'm going to be sad and I don't know anybody there.
00:44:28 And so she drops me off
00:44:30 and then this is from her perspective.
00:44:32 She comes by to pick me up.
00:44:34 And at the end of the day,
00:44:36 she's like, Nate, come here.
00:44:38 I crawl out of the woods
00:44:40 and I have my belt stuffed with pine cones.
00:44:42 And I'm like,
00:44:44 I've got four sticks strapped to my back
00:44:46 and I'm dual wielding these big ol' limbs.
00:44:48 And I'm like, Mom,
00:44:50 I'm in the middle of something.
00:44:52 I need to come back later. We're dueling right now.
00:44:54 The shit is real.
00:44:56 Go away.
00:44:58 That's what happens.
00:45:00 Stick duels in the woods.
00:45:02 Stick duels are the best.
00:45:04 Stick duels were a major part of my whole childhood,
00:45:06 where me and my friends
00:45:08 would go out into the woods
00:45:10 and just try to find
00:45:12 sticks that are about the size of
00:45:14 swords and
00:45:16 come back to the house and fight with them.
00:45:18 We would have a pretty sizable collection
00:45:20 because if they were good, you'd hold on to them until they break.
00:45:22 So we'd keep a pile
00:45:24 of all our really good sticks by the side of the house.
00:45:26 And then my friend
00:45:28 Marcus, who is like a
00:45:30 like a fucking built
00:45:32 action guy, he just loved to play around
00:45:34 with stuff like this anyways.
00:45:36 He would just film videos of himself
00:45:38 doing kung fu and shit in high school.
00:45:40 And so
00:45:42 we would just go into the backyard when he came over
00:45:44 and because he was really quiet and literally
00:45:46 just wouldn't talk or say anything, we'd be like
00:45:48 I guess we're just gonna fight with sticks.
00:45:50 That's what we'll do when he comes over.
00:45:52 So every time he came over, we'd just fight with
00:45:54 sticks until one of us got hurt
00:45:56 and didn't want to do it anymore.
00:45:58 My friend that I had in high school
00:46:00 told this story.
00:46:02 He would tell the story like it was true
00:46:04 and no one believed it, so it was really funny.
00:46:06 He said that some
00:46:08 like
00:46:10 dojo master
00:46:12 stick fighter had like
00:46:14 come to his house one day and knocked on his door
00:46:16 looking for him specifically
00:46:18 and challenged
00:46:20 Who was this? Which one was this been?
00:46:22 Started with a J.
00:46:24 Okay, okay, I got you.
00:46:28 And then he had challenged him just specifically
00:46:30 and he had dueled him in his backyard at stick fighting
00:46:32 and he had won.
00:46:34 So, you know.
00:46:36 Damn J.
00:46:38 This is unrelatable to me.
00:46:40 This stick wielding experience, not only because
00:46:42 I don't live next to a forge, but also
00:46:44 like again, I'm post going outside.
00:46:46 Going outside was not an option when I was growing up.
00:46:48 Like you couldn't do it anymore.
00:46:50 Was it dangerous or something?
00:46:52 Well, it was a combination.
00:46:54 It was really hot in California.
00:46:56 It was a combination of it being drilled into.
00:46:58 It was like don't go outside, there are strangers there
00:47:00 and also there are video games now.
00:47:02 I mean, Munchy, that was a thing when I was a kid
00:47:04 right before I was a kid as well.
00:47:06 It's like what, the late 80s at least?
00:47:08 I just got to very briefly mention
00:47:10 my brother got big into stick fighting.
00:47:12 What he would specifically do is go to the hardware store
00:47:14 get a big old plank and then sand it down
00:47:16 to where it becomes like an actual weapon
00:47:18 and I think like if you
00:47:20 honored him in battle in combat with a regular stick,
00:47:22 he would eventually like get one for you
00:47:24 and help you make your own.
00:47:26 So I ended up getting one, but yeah.
00:47:28 I think I need to take a step back to point out
00:47:30 that the ages that I would have stick fought
00:47:32 would have been ages like
00:47:34 12 to 17, which is the period
00:47:36 of time I have known Munchy.
00:47:38 So I know what Munchy's been doing
00:47:40 as opposed to stick fighting.
00:47:42 He's been in the PCP and drawing fan art
00:47:44 and sending me pickup lines on Tumblr.
00:47:46 Those are the fucking days, dude.
00:47:48 Those are the fucking days.
00:47:50 I still like reminisce and think about
00:47:52 how that's how we met.
00:47:54 That's how all of this happened
00:47:56 was I sent you, hey are you an archaeologist
00:47:58 because I've got a bone for you to pick.
00:48:00 Bone to pick for you to examine.
00:48:02 I love it.
00:48:04 We have a whole section of this podcast
00:48:06 talking about the death of toys,
00:48:08 the death of going outside and the rise of video games.
00:48:10 That needs to be something we talk about in depth.
00:48:12 Instead of doing stick fighting
00:48:14 all that I do with my friends
00:48:16 was just play Smash Bros.
00:48:18 Which is the same amount of pain
00:48:20 and shit talking.
00:48:22 I did that at the same time, too, though.
00:48:24 I could play Smash Bros. since I was 8
00:48:26 because I had the N64.
00:48:28 It's just whismical.
00:48:30 Stick fighting was a younger man's game for me.
00:48:32 Video games are an old man's game
00:48:34 in my mind.
00:48:36 When I was 9
00:48:38 and younger at summer camp,
00:48:40 maybe between 9 and 12 or something,
00:48:42 those were peak stick fighting years
00:48:44 as I recall them.
00:48:46 But hey, I've got a story
00:48:48 which is relevant to this question
00:48:50 of what we like as a child versus an adult
00:48:52 only this is how I was exactly the same.
00:48:54 I know I've told similar stories
00:48:56 but I don't believe I've ever told this one
00:48:58 and I think everyone will appreciate it greatly.
00:49:00 I don't remember exactly
00:49:02 what was going through my mind at the time
00:49:04 but I was around
00:49:06 between 12 and 15 at this time.
00:49:08 Something in that range.
00:49:10 It was nighttime and it was summertime.
00:49:12 I don't know what was going on
00:49:14 but my parents went up to bed
00:49:16 and they were like, Nate, walk our dog
00:49:18 which was Buddy at the time, I think.
00:49:20 Yeah, Buddy was my muse.
00:49:22 And he...
00:49:24 Three quarters peak and he's one quarter poodle
00:49:26 for those wondering.
00:49:28 I'm sure the audience was just dying to know.
00:49:30 I'm adding richness to the scene.
00:49:32 So imagine me with this little dog emperor
00:49:34 on the leash taking a shit
00:49:36 and here I stand.
00:49:38 So the way that my parents
00:49:40 are back yard was set up
00:49:42 my parents' room is kind of up
00:49:44 really high on the house
00:49:46 and there's three layers down
00:49:48 is where the grass is behind the house.
00:49:50 Jesus Christ, what kind of house did you live in?
00:49:52 I mean, there's the basement
00:49:54 then the first floor, then the second floor
00:49:56 and there's an attic
00:49:58 but they're in the second floor, not the attic.
00:50:00 There's a hill in the front of the house
00:50:02 that doesn't go to the back so it gets lower.
00:50:04 The basement was exposed in the back.
00:50:06 Yeah, that's right.
00:50:08 But whatever.
00:50:10 Incidentally, my parents are selling that soon but whatever.
00:50:12 So the point was...
00:50:14 This is the point.
00:50:16 I'm walking buddy and I don't know
00:50:18 I don't know what was going through my mind.
00:50:20 I think it had been a late night of watching anime.
00:50:22 That's how all terrible ideas started.
00:50:24 That's right, that's right.
00:50:26 Was it Adult Swim?
00:50:28 It was definitely Adult Swim.
00:50:30 Or maybe Toonami or something.
00:50:32 One of my stories was on
00:50:34 and I don't know what was going through my mind
00:50:36 but I was thinking about the future
00:50:38 and I was thinking about what I was going to do with myself
00:50:40 as life went on and I wasn't talking to buddy
00:50:42 or anything, I was talking to myself
00:50:44 and I'm just like...
00:50:46 I'm not.
00:50:48 I'm not going to be a cog in the machine.
00:50:50 I'm not
00:50:52 going to be a cog in the machine.
00:50:54 I'm going to achieve my destiny.
00:50:56 I'm going to do whatever it takes.
00:50:58 I'm going to make it in this world and be important.
00:51:00 So I was just talking to myself loudly
00:51:02 just repeating these mantras
00:51:04 to myself based on, like, I don't know,
00:51:06 a tri-gun episode I just watched
00:51:08 or a couple of bebop or something.
00:51:10 Like you do.
00:51:12 That's what was going on.
00:51:14 Were you wearing your entire HD hat while you did this?
00:51:16 You know, I should have been.
00:51:18 If I thought to gather it, I would have.
00:51:20 Not much happened in that story.
00:51:22 Not much happened in that story.
00:51:24 Okay, well this is the important part.
00:51:26 It's that afterward, so the next day
00:51:28 I'm just at breakfast,
00:51:30 whatever, and I'm sitting there,
00:51:32 I'm eating breakfast, and then mom,
00:51:34 my mom just leans down over the countertop,
00:51:36 looks at me with her big eyes
00:51:38 the way they look at an oncoming train
00:51:40 and says, uh, so,
00:51:42 not going to be a cog in the machine, huh?
00:51:44 No!
00:51:46 No!
00:51:48 Get the fuck in there.
00:51:50 They had heard everything.
00:51:52 That's so terrible.
00:51:54 My words.
00:51:56 How could you do that to someone?
00:51:58 How could you do that to your son?
00:52:00 I would have died right on the spot.
00:52:02 I would have died right there.
00:52:04 Speaking of embarrassing Nate's stories,
00:52:06 will you tell us about
00:52:08 the story of the, um...
00:52:10 The talent show?
00:52:12 Is that the one? Okay, yes.
00:52:14 I don't know if I've ever told this,
00:52:16 so I'll tell this one quicker than that one.
00:52:18 So it was just, in high school,
00:52:20 I thought I was the shit, and this was like, um...
00:52:22 Which you were, evidently.
00:52:24 Which I was. It was either freshman or sophomore year.
00:52:26 Whatever, it doesn't matter. The point was,
00:52:28 oh god, I'm still hurting.
00:52:30 I'm still hurting from the climax.
00:52:32 It was absolutely devastating.
00:52:34 And I'm sure dad had heard it too,
00:52:36 and they just colored their...
00:52:38 Imagine them up there.
00:52:40 Imagine they're up in their room.
00:52:42 They heard you, and then they talked about it,
00:52:44 like, when they were in bed again.
00:52:46 They were up there.
00:52:48 I'm upset with them.
00:52:50 It was cruel.
00:52:52 I mean, there's nothing they could have said,
00:52:54 like, Nate, we can hear you.
00:52:56 Shut the hell up.
00:52:58 They could have just not said anything.
00:53:00 Well, they didn't have to.
00:53:02 That story reminded me of a very short one
00:53:04 from when I was like 12 or 13,
00:53:06 maybe a little older.
00:53:08 Somewhere in the early teens,
00:53:10 and I had woken up,
00:53:12 jacked off,
00:53:14 and I was like,
00:53:16 I was about to leave my bedroom.
00:53:18 He started off the day,
00:53:20 groggy, like, I don't want to leave the bedroom,
00:53:22 but I was younger.
00:53:24 I had to look out to make sure that nobody was around
00:53:26 before I left my bedroom.
00:53:28 I didn't want to be bothered until I had time
00:53:30 to wake up and be able to talk to people.
00:53:32 So I was listening in
00:53:34 to the downstairs to see what was going on,
00:53:36 and I could hear my grandma talking to my mom,
00:53:38 and she's like,
00:53:40 well, why don't you go wake him up?
00:53:42 Because that's how she sounds.
00:53:44 And my mom's like, well, he sleeps naked,
00:53:46 and I don't want to sleep naked.
00:53:48 She goes, he just does that so he can touch himself.
00:53:50 And I was like, oh my god.
00:53:52 And literally,
00:53:54 I was just like, well, I mean,
00:53:56 yeah.
00:53:58 I think that says more about your grandma
00:54:00 than about you.
00:54:02 It does.
00:54:04 Well, that's interesting nonetheless.
00:54:06 It says the same about both of us, actually,
00:54:08 because she was right.
00:54:10 There's things to be learned.
00:54:12 Obviously, that's true,
00:54:14 but I think it speaks something
00:54:16 that she felt the need to point it out.
00:54:18 Your grandma's logic doesn't make sense.
00:54:20 Well, don't mind the fact that he's naked.
00:54:22 He does that for purposes of masturbation.
00:54:24 That means there's no reason to not go to the room.
00:54:26 That's really refute.
00:54:28 Yeah, it doesn't.
00:54:30 Guys, quick question.
00:54:32 When you were a kid,
00:54:34 did you ever worry about secret cameras
00:54:36 in your house?
00:54:38 No.
00:54:40 Well, I didn't grow up in a former Soviet Union country.
00:54:42 Well, as a matter of fact,
00:54:44 our dad did set up a camera
00:54:46 in the basement at one point,
00:54:48 which was most likely to keep it.
00:54:50 Oh, I forgot. I thought it was on the outside,
00:54:52 but no, there was one on the inside for a while.
00:54:54 Wait, are you sure? I remember being outside,
00:54:56 but he could look in with it.
00:54:58 That's what I remember.
00:55:00 I remember him saying knowingly,
00:55:02 when you had some friends over,
00:55:04 I'll just be keeping an eye on the outside,
00:55:06 but maybe I'll take a look on the inside.
00:55:08 I'll just be watching through my surveillance camera.
00:55:10 Yeah, don't worry. Our dad's a fucking creep.
00:55:12 Oh, he didn't think
00:55:14 of the consequences of how we'd feel.
00:55:16 The consequences.
00:55:18 He's a silly man.
00:55:20 The consequences that I was unsettled by him
00:55:22 generally.
00:55:24 Help me ruminate on this.
00:55:26 Because this is a real thing of thought that I have.
00:55:28 I think that hiding stuff from your parents
00:55:30 is literally like a good healthy thing to do.
00:55:32 Yes.
00:55:34 It will help breed individualism
00:55:36 and make you more independent as a person.
00:55:38 An adult does not need to know
00:55:40 when you start whacking off.
00:55:42 It's just like what?
00:55:44 I don't necessarily agree with you, Munchy,
00:55:46 but I think that the problem,
00:55:48 the reason I don't agree with you,
00:55:50 is that ideally you wouldn't have
00:55:52 to hide things from your parents,
00:55:54 because your parents would have a better understanding of you.
00:55:56 The only reason I did this is because
00:55:58 I think it's a fundamental question
00:56:00 of human nature as opposed to a good
00:56:02 relationship with your children.
00:56:04 I straight up don't think a child
00:56:06 ever should pass along the information
00:56:08 as to whether or not they jack off.
00:56:10 Okay, you don't have to tell me.
00:56:12 I will know that.
00:56:14 Yeah.
00:56:16 The reason you have to hide from your...
00:56:18 Sorry.
00:56:20 I have to say this.
00:56:22 The reason you have to hide from your parents
00:56:24 is that they refuse
00:56:26 to be in the reality
00:56:28 you are actually in.
00:56:30 I don't want to be in the reality
00:56:32 when my son is jacking off.
00:56:34 Your son is going to jack off.
00:56:36 That happens. They all do it.
00:56:38 If your son is like
00:56:40 13, 14,
00:56:42 you should just know.
00:56:44 He's probably jacking off.
00:56:46 You should know better.
00:56:48 A lot of parents just try to
00:56:50 live in the universe in their own mind
00:56:52 where you don't do the things
00:56:54 that they don't want you to do.
00:56:56 A lot of the time it's not a matter of
00:56:58 not wanting to accept it.
00:57:00 It's just not wanting to believe
00:57:02 in the sense that you don't have
00:57:04 the attention to it.
00:57:06 Why would they not want that?
00:57:08 Because
00:57:10 it makes
00:57:12 for a society that
00:57:14 can change.
00:57:16 Nobody wants a kid that is just obedient.
00:57:18 Because
00:57:20 they need to rebel in some way.
00:57:22 It's not about the parents knowing.
00:57:24 No, because leadership.
00:57:26 It's about the kid taking the initiative
00:57:28 to not tell them certain things.
00:57:30 I think that
00:57:32 the way that we often...
00:57:34 the systems in which discipline is instilled
00:57:36 in the military
00:57:38 is that you have
00:57:40 an extreme authoritarian figure
00:57:42 grinding you into the ground
00:57:44 and they are also
00:57:46 they have total control over you.
00:57:48 That can make you
00:57:50 experience ego death
00:57:52 in a similar kind of way where
00:57:54 you can gain maturity
00:57:56 by looking past yourself.
00:57:58 I do think there's also
00:58:00 good reasons, good things you can learn
00:58:02 by learning to deceive
00:58:04 people who are wrong.
00:58:06 The reason you should lie to your parents
00:58:08 is that they're probably wrong.
00:58:10 But if your parents are
00:58:12 communicating with you
00:58:14 and you have a good relationship
00:58:16 what are you going to hide from them?
00:58:18 You can't just make up shit to hide from your parents
00:58:20 just to learn that lesson.
00:58:22 Your parents can just teach you
00:58:24 that lesson.
00:58:26 There will be differences.
00:58:28 I'm going to teach my kids to hide a lot of things from school.
00:58:30 I'm going to teach them to hide a lot of things from...
00:58:32 How much you are going to have in common with your kids?
00:58:34 You are way overestimating.
00:58:36 I am not saying that I am going to do
00:58:38 a perfect job raising my kids
00:58:40 and go through all... I'm just saying that in an ideal...
00:58:42 I'm saying philosophically why your point is incorrect
00:58:44 because no parent alive
00:58:46 should ever know everything their children do.
00:58:48 I can't imagine any of us having children.
00:58:50 Why do you need to know?
00:58:52 There's a huge difference between knowing everything
00:58:54 they do and hiding
00:58:56 things from your parents.
00:58:58 If someone goes and takes a dump
00:59:00 and you don't tell me that you went to take a dump
00:59:02 you're not hiding it from me.
00:59:04 That's a good example
00:59:06 because taking a shit
00:59:08 is an embarrassing thing to do
00:59:10 just as a human being.
00:59:12 It just is. People don't really want to talk about it.
00:59:14 If you're stupid...
00:59:16 But what if it's a really impressive shit?
00:59:18 That's one of the base...
00:59:20 literally everyone does it
00:59:22 and yet we're kind of embarrassed about it.
00:59:24 It's just...
00:59:26 I'm embarrassed about it because
00:59:28 I think there are legitimate reasons
00:59:30 to be embarrassed about shit
00:59:32 and those are the reasons that I am.
00:59:34 I don't want you to smell my shit because it smells bad.
00:59:36 And I don't want to look at it
00:59:38 because it looks gross.
00:59:40 But the fact that someone takes a shit
00:59:42 there are people out there
00:59:44 there are women out there for instance
00:59:46 who will not acknowledge the fact that they shit.
00:59:48 I know them.
00:59:50 Or they won't acknowledge that they fart
00:59:52 and I'm like I don't give a fuck
00:59:54 that you shit or fart because I do the same things
00:59:56 and I'm not going to hold that against you
00:59:58 but some people feel like they are expected
01:00:00 to think those things are embarrassing
01:00:02 and so they find them embarrassing.
01:00:04 They're not using logic, they're using expectations.
01:00:06 So I'm saying that
01:00:08 in my idea of a perfect society
01:00:10 it's one where
01:00:12 we don't have to tell everyone
01:00:14 everything that's going on
01:00:16 because we should all have a level of understanding
01:00:18 and trust in one another
01:00:20 that we trust you to be doing something good.
01:00:22 The reason that people come into contact with their parents
01:00:24 is that those trust relationships break down
01:00:26 because your parents do not
01:00:28 set reasonable expectations for you.
01:00:30 They want you to be perfect instead of being human
01:00:32 even though they made you
01:00:34 while being imperfect
01:00:36 and being human and they don't understand
01:00:38 how to be perfect.
01:00:40 If you want to truly be
01:00:42 on the level with your kids
01:00:44 you have to be employing as much of an open mind
01:00:46 and critical thinking as the child themselves
01:00:48 is growing up.
01:00:50 When I think of kids I'm thinking
01:00:52 what is the most
01:00:54 difficult and hard to relate to?
01:00:56 Imagine if I, Ben St,
01:00:58 were capable of the titanic feet
01:01:00 of employing the level
01:01:02 of critical thinking as a child.
01:01:04 Imagine if you had the capability
01:01:06 of listening
01:01:08 instead of jutting in and interrupting
01:01:10 to do in the middle of a statement.
01:01:12 So the thing is
01:01:14 the thing is
01:01:16 I think my dad in particular
01:01:18 never saw coming how little
01:01:20 of a shit me and my siblings would care
01:01:22 about Christianity because
01:01:24 my dad came from a broken fucking house
01:01:26 broken fucking family, broken fucking world
01:01:28 so he needs this
01:01:30 theological backbone
01:01:32 but then he made the mistake of raising his children
01:01:34 to be happy with life
01:01:36 so it's like why the hell do I need
01:01:38 a diadol narrative to back up
01:01:40 conscious
01:01:42 ability to make up a warning?
01:01:44 I used to love Christianity up until
01:01:46 someone told me that people actually believe
01:01:48 the stories
01:01:50 whoa!
01:01:52 that's pretty bad
01:01:54 that's post-soviet
01:01:56 we're not just like
01:01:58 we're not just role playing
01:02:00 what I liked
01:02:02 about it is just like
01:02:04 it sounded to me like fairy tales
01:02:06 and like oh it's just
01:02:08 stories to teach a moral
01:02:10 that's what I thought about it
01:02:12 yeah it's a story time
01:02:14 I used to take
01:02:16 a class that he would teach
01:02:18 Christianity
01:02:20 I think wrote Roman Catholicism
01:02:22 specifically
01:02:24 basically in that class
01:02:26 they just would tell the stories and I'd get to draw
01:02:28 so it was like the perfect class
01:02:30 once a month
01:02:32 we have grape juice and crackers
01:02:34 it's pretty good
01:02:36 Catholicism is like the jock Christianity
01:02:38 branch
01:02:40 whereas the more Protestant
01:02:42 particular education oriented
01:02:44 actually like really seriously
01:02:46 following the Bible to the letter is definitely
01:02:48 the nerd group of Christianity
01:02:50 it's like what Ted Cruz is all like
01:02:52 I put it more in terms of
01:02:54 the virgin Protestant
01:02:56 versus the Chad Catholic
01:02:58 someone make that shit
01:03:00 it really is though
01:03:02 actually fucking hilarious
01:03:04 the Catholics are all about image
01:03:06 and looking good and being popular
01:03:08 whereas the
01:03:10 Protestants and especially Baptists
01:03:12 following the rules and being faithful
01:03:14 correctly
01:03:16 someone should draw
01:03:18 the virgin Martin Luther
01:03:20 the Chad Chad
01:03:22 because someone making like the
01:03:24 imagine if someone made the Chad Protestant
01:03:26 it would come off as totally
01:03:28 unironic and they really believe
01:03:30 that they're cool
01:03:32 the Chad
01:03:34 the Catholic needs to
01:03:36 have like eight names at least
01:03:38 he needs to have like the name of
01:03:40 every Baptist in his
01:03:42 Virgil, Sanctius, Augustine
01:03:44 the 14th
01:03:46 do we?
01:03:48 as people? yeah
01:03:50 don't you get like the middle names from
01:03:52 being like baptizer or whatever
01:03:54 oh some no
01:03:56 maybe Catholics do, I mean we were
01:03:58 Protestant so like
01:04:00 or someone like chooses like a given name
01:04:02 like they choose like a biblical name
01:04:04 when they get confirmed or something
01:04:06 when I was young and getting confirmed
01:04:08 I was mad at Catholics
01:04:10 and I expressed this very autistically
01:04:12 that I didn't get to choose like my own new name
01:04:14 I really wanted the name Gabriel
01:04:16 I thought it'd be cool but
01:04:18 I was asking my dad what percentage of devoted Catholics
01:04:20 do you think are going to go to heaven
01:04:22 he said 25%
01:04:24 wait but doesn't your dad believe in heaven
01:04:26 and stuff though? yeah well my dad's just like
01:04:28 basically one time
01:04:30 me and my dad were talking about the idea of cult
01:04:32 like people who take Christianity and then like
01:04:34 have their own stupid idea of what it means
01:04:36 and they take it too far and he's like oh well
01:04:38 the whole Catholic Church is basically a cult
01:04:40 and I said what percentage of them
01:04:42 in spite of following Catholicism correctly
01:04:44 are still like believing in God
01:04:46 correctly he's like probably 25%
01:04:48 those are the ones you're going to get to heaven
01:04:50 why wouldn't it be zero?
01:04:52 there's a lot of looseness
01:04:54 because you're a Protestant you've already
01:04:56 deviated majorly like from the codified
01:04:58 original Catholic shit
01:05:00 so like it's loosey goosey out here
01:05:02 Catholicism also deviates from Judaism
01:05:04 so you know
01:05:06 well I mean because Jesus
01:05:08 well I imagine the number for Jews
01:05:10 is 0%
01:05:12 oh I probably
01:05:14 whatever what the fuck was I even talking about
01:05:16 talking about my dad, talking about relating to your kids
01:05:18 so I'm thinking okay I need to be prepared
01:05:20 because my parents also like
01:05:22 projected the fact that when they wanted to
01:05:24 homeschool their kids onto the fact that
01:05:26 they would have done really good that they suddenly had to do homeschool
01:05:28 because going to public schools
01:05:30 is a much bigger pain in the ass
01:05:32 the thing about homeschool is if you're fucking disciplined
01:05:34 you can just get all your work done immediately
01:05:36 and like the light world is your oyster
01:05:38 the problem is it's so easy
01:05:40 it's such a much more efficient way of doing it
01:05:42 that it's really fucking boring and hard to like pay attention
01:05:44 right? so like we just barely
01:05:46 squeaked our way through it but my parents didn't
01:05:48 get why it would be hard
01:05:50 for that reason they couldn't relate
01:05:52 so I need to be prepared I need to like basically
01:05:54 hope that my kids are as
01:05:56 unrelatable to me as possible so I'm imagining them like
01:05:58 not being into video games at all
01:06:00 or art just being fucking chads
01:06:02 they want to do sports I need to prepare for that
01:06:04 also political views
01:06:06 like how the world is
01:06:08 because we think oh old people are so stupid
01:06:10 for not understanding
01:06:12 every color is the same level of human
01:06:14 no like fucking racism is bad
01:06:16 but in a
01:06:18 generation or two who knows where it could
01:06:20 evolve into a degree that we now are
01:06:22 fuddy duddy so I'm just basically going to
01:06:24 assume that being a fucking
01:06:26 anti-SJW racist is gonna be
01:06:28 popular in like 2020
01:06:30 or like 2030 or so
01:06:32 it's already getting pretty hot
01:06:34 it's already getting pretty hot
01:06:36 and also like respecting
01:06:38 things are heating up
01:06:40 having a respect
01:06:42 will be seen as wrong
01:06:44 there'll be all these like woke like fucking
01:06:46 parables about how
01:06:48 having a listening to the other side is wrong
01:06:50 trying to be respectful to someone over
01:06:52 disagreement is like all like it's lies
01:06:54 right? I need to be prepared
01:06:56 for my kids to have that ideology
01:06:58 that I think is just completely wrong
01:07:00 so that I could be prepared
01:07:02 and act cool about it be like uh huh
01:07:04 that's your belief?
01:07:06 oh really? you believe that?
01:07:08 you don't understand
01:07:10 just like any parent
01:07:12 what if you act all like
01:07:14 befuddled about it?
01:07:16 I've never heard of a person who actually blows up
01:07:18 and says what you're doing something
01:07:20 new get out of here
01:07:22 I've never heard of a person has a parent like that
01:07:24 oh I know
01:07:26 I have friends who have parents
01:07:28 who are just like
01:07:30 I mean it's like
01:07:32 if you're a parent and like for whatever reason
01:07:34 if your world view comes
01:07:36 majorly in conflict with like what your child
01:07:38 chooses to do with their life
01:07:40 like it has to be in a serious major way
01:07:42 that's really the only way I can see it
01:07:44 I'll just give you some perspective
01:07:46 I have a friend who's mom
01:07:48 this was when Pokemon Go was first coming out
01:07:50 possibly one of the only
01:07:52 old people in existence who was still
01:07:54 writing the Pokemon's demonic line
01:07:56 even when Pokemon Go made a popular movie
01:07:58 whoa that's retro
01:08:00 I know right?
01:08:02 she found a fake article
01:08:04 in which there was a fake interview
01:08:06 with the guy who created Pokemon
01:08:08 who in this fake interview says
01:08:10 that he made Pokemon specifically to convert
01:08:12 Western children to Satanism
01:08:14 and she thought it was real
01:08:16 and sent it to my friend
01:08:18 her daughter saying this is why you shouldn't play Pokemon
01:08:20 she thought it was real
01:08:22 does her dad work at Nintendo?
01:08:24 is that how she knew?
01:08:26 we interviewed a Japanese entrepreneur
01:08:28 Ken Pokemon
01:08:30 we asked him why
01:08:32 my friend told her
01:08:34 that's a fake article and she's like
01:08:36 it might be but what it's saying
01:08:38 is ultimately true
01:08:40 dare we take that chance?
01:08:42 it's enlightening that her answer
01:08:44 does not hinge at all
01:08:46 on whether it is fake
01:08:48 she's the kind of parent
01:08:50 who will be like that
01:08:52 she will actually do a gasp
01:08:54 my friend said it was really hard
01:08:56 drop her monocle
01:08:58 what's the rule we established
01:09:00 one person says one thing
01:09:02 and another person says the same thing
01:09:04 it must be true
01:09:06 my friend said it was really hard
01:09:08 for her to learn how to drive
01:09:10 and her mom
01:09:12 if anything might be dangerous
01:09:14 happening in the car
01:09:16 I would gasp and freak my friend
01:09:18 be like
01:09:20 there are definitely parents
01:09:22 you will go
01:09:24 juggling knives in the car
01:09:26 that's slightly dangerous
01:09:28 I would gasp if I was in danger of automobile
01:09:30 more like
01:09:32 it's time for you to slow down at the stop sign
01:09:34 and you are in no way
01:09:36 you're not taking too long
01:09:38 to slow down but I'm worried you might not
01:09:40 so I'm going to gasp
01:09:42 I kind of know what that's like
01:09:44 to drive these days is pretty terrifying
01:09:46 when you're not in control
01:09:48 indeed
01:09:50 what would you guys do at school like
01:09:52 would you guys be happy in school
01:09:54 insert the entire school
01:09:56 podcast here please
01:09:58 is there really anyone
01:10:00 on earth that was unironically happy
01:10:02 in school
01:10:04 when I was a kid I loved school
01:10:06 when I was a teenager I hated school
01:10:08 I mean
01:10:10 it could have been good at school
01:10:12 I was happy at school
01:10:14 if you look at me now
01:10:16 you would probably think
01:10:18 we didn't really have bullies
01:10:20 in my school
01:10:22 that didn't really go on
01:10:24 nobody got beat up or anything
01:10:26 I felt
01:10:28 everyone was way too high to worry about that
01:10:30 I felt ostracized
01:10:32 and I felt like a nerd
01:10:34 and a social pariah
01:10:36 but looking back I had a clicker too
01:10:38 that I was pretty tight with
01:10:40 jokes in class and people would laugh
01:10:42 and stuff
01:10:44 I remember a cracked article
01:10:46 and any time I said a cracked article
01:10:48 I always want to say it because I don't trust cracked
01:10:50 that much but they said
01:10:52 there was an article that mentioned
01:10:54 that the kids who shot up Columbine
01:10:56 they were not bullied
01:10:58 they just have a huge victim complex
01:11:00 yeah
01:11:02 I mean
01:11:04 same goes for Elliott
01:11:06 Roger
01:11:08 he actually got turned down by any women
01:11:10 he just
01:11:12 never got offered
01:11:14 he got turned down
01:11:16 at least once
01:11:18 not enough
01:11:20 the fault lies
01:11:22 most of it was just him from afar
01:11:24 looking at women and being like they would never accept me
01:11:26 what was Gib saying though
01:11:28 he was chiming in
01:11:30 do you love
01:11:32 Elliott Roger as much as we
01:11:34 the conversation changed
01:11:36 and I forgot what I was going to say
01:11:38 the topic is childhood
01:11:40 my whole experience
01:11:42 of school was the first day of school
01:11:44 I got on the bus and I distinctly
01:11:46 remember that like
01:11:48 I cried because I had to let go of my mom
01:11:50 I had never been like outside
01:11:52 of like eyesight of my mom basically
01:11:54 by this point
01:11:56 when I get on the bus and I go like right to the back
01:11:58 and I'm looking out her through the back window
01:12:00 and she's waving and I'm crying
01:12:02 and it was misery for
01:12:04 like 12 years
01:12:06 I want to quickly say
01:12:08 it's weird like did she say like that's the
01:12:10 the first time he you know
01:12:12 he wasn't with an eye shut of his mom
01:12:14 like remember my wild days
01:12:16 when I was a kid like around five years or so
01:12:18 like my parents would just let me go
01:12:20 into the neighborhood and I was not
01:12:22 supervised five years old
01:12:24 yeah well mage it's different when you're raised
01:12:26 by wolves it's a different sort of
01:12:28 dynamic you know there
01:12:30 yeah it's interesting like
01:12:32 right now it's dangerous and probably
01:12:34 no one would let their kids go off
01:12:36 it's actually safer than it's ever been
01:12:38 statistically it's just
01:12:40 it had nothing to do with it being dangerous
01:12:42 where my parents are not allowing me
01:12:44 I had no interest in being outside
01:12:46 the eyesight of my mom so
01:12:48 yeah and I'm just saying in general
01:12:50 like nowadays like no
01:12:52 no self-respecting
01:12:54 the perception the what are they called
01:12:56 hover parents or whatever the hovercraft
01:12:58 whatever
01:13:00 all parents are beta orbiters of their children
01:13:02 beta orbiters
01:13:04 that's a problem
01:13:06 all parents have been
01:13:08 totally friends
01:13:10 totally fucking talking about this now
01:13:12 let's talk about the death of going outside
01:13:14 let's not talk about that right now
01:13:16 because I was walking around my old childhood
01:13:18 ruins for devious reasons
01:13:20 that will not disclose
01:13:22 I was walking around like like old schoolyards
01:13:24 and stuff like that and I've noticed that I still
01:13:26 have the feeling two this day like years after
01:13:28 I moved out of like my elementary middle school and stuff
01:13:30 where when I'm in the car
01:13:32 and like we turn in
01:13:34 to go to school and we turn in the same
01:13:36 turn that I've been like I went to
01:13:38 when I was in school I still get the
01:13:40 pit of anxiety and like
01:13:42 oh god it's really happening like I'm going
01:13:44 to school today like it's like
01:13:46 I'm ready I'm ready to go into homeroom
01:13:48 oh god like years like
01:13:50 even I was going to my kindergarten elementary
01:13:52 school and I turned
01:13:54 into the complex and I felt a pit
01:13:56 of despair growing my stomach
01:13:58 and I felt I was going to go
01:14:00 to school that day
01:14:02 you know it's interesting like
01:14:04 having not gone to school
01:14:06 there's an interesting perception
01:14:08 I get from people right
01:14:10 whenever a new school a new fresh shooting
01:14:12 happens right and we count up the
01:14:14 bodies one two
01:14:16 twelve bodies
01:14:18 and so then you know the people
01:14:20 have their opinions
01:14:22 and what's funny is that there's something
01:14:24 like both sides always agree on
01:14:26 but they never like talk about this part
01:14:28 so basically one
01:14:30 side always goes so
01:14:32 okay you know how we keep some
01:14:34 a bunch of kids keep getting shot up and some
01:14:36 kids decide to like grab guns and shoot kids
01:14:38 in these giant prisons that we locked them
01:14:40 up in for nine hours a day that they're all miserable
01:14:42 and depressed in I think it's probably
01:14:44 because of the video games they
01:14:46 relaxed with when they come home that's
01:14:48 what caused it right and then other people
01:14:50 are like hey you know those giant buildings
01:14:52 were like kids locked up for nine hours
01:14:54 a day and feel miserable and depressed and anxious
01:14:56 like their entire youths I think
01:14:58 it's actually the fact that they have a weapon
01:15:00 to shoot kids within the first place we should
01:15:02 get rid of the weapon and I'm like hold on
01:15:04 why are we addressing the fact that we're locking everyone
01:15:06 up in these nine hour prisons for their entire
01:15:08 youths that they're all terrified and depressed in
01:15:10 like why not address that part of the issue
01:15:12 excuse me I mean I
01:15:14 yeah I mean you collect all the all the
01:15:16 delicate exploding hundred point bonus
01:15:18 you know bullet sponges in one place
01:15:20 that I'm gonna want to get the high score
01:15:22 we're not saying that you all deserve to lose
01:15:24 your kids for help making us participate
01:15:26 in this system just that maybe I don't feel as bad
01:15:28 my favorite is the hot diggity demon
01:15:30 tweet which was um
01:15:32 new school gets shot up people
01:15:34 ban guns me ban schools
01:15:36 I think I retweeted that that was a great one
01:15:38 when I went to college in the UK
01:15:40 this is a slow down topic but I just want to
01:15:42 quickly say Munchie let mage finish she's been
01:15:44 tramming in die die
01:15:46 when I went to college in the UK
01:15:48 we had like first of
01:15:50 all we had like lanyards so we wouldn't
01:15:52 be able to access the
01:15:54 the buildings unless we were allowed
01:15:56 to and we also had metal detectors
01:15:58 so we couldn't bring anything
01:16:00 metal in them and UK doesn't even
01:16:02 have guns so I think that's
01:16:04 an interesting practice that made should
01:16:06 be considered maybe
01:16:08 it's an interesting
01:16:10 thing I completely agree that schools need
01:16:12 to be banned get rid of them now
01:16:14 yeah I had a
01:16:16 point and I forgot so continue and I'll think about it
01:16:18 alright I have the thing about
01:16:20 school I don't
01:16:22 remember being on the school podcast I remember
01:16:24 I think I missed it
01:16:26 I wanted to be on it I don't want to go on to
01:16:28 like a huge spiel but my basic
01:16:30 thoughts on school is that
01:16:32 I used to hate it
01:16:34 obviously because that's what you're supposed to do
01:16:36 um but like
01:16:38 after checking my privilege after
01:16:40 going through and remembering that
01:16:42 I'm I'm actually
01:16:44 like I'm a white boy
01:16:46 and it was a pretty good school and it was pretty
01:16:48 good and there were lots of nice people there
01:16:50 I didn't actually have a terrible time I had
01:16:52 a lot of like good like
01:16:54 like um like the art department
01:16:56 at my school was quite nice
01:16:58 and the teachers were chill and they
01:17:00 would let me stay behind like after
01:17:02 school to just work on the teachers were
01:17:04 chill the school was lit the cafeteria
01:17:06 was on the
01:17:08 like like the average
01:17:10 places to chill at
01:17:12 so the obvious things about school were like
01:17:14 uh yeah that some people it's
01:17:16 social structures are shit
01:17:18 a lot of teenagers are terrible and
01:17:20 cliques are gay um
01:17:22 and I was shy so like
01:17:24 says member of the pcp hypocrite
01:17:26 got him
01:17:28 it was a good it was a good time
01:17:30 if it wasn't the greatest but like
01:17:32 I I appreciate school
01:17:34 like when it's done right it's pretty
01:17:36 good
01:17:38 well school gave me the chance
01:17:40 to rise the highest I have in my life
01:17:42 and fall to my lowest point
01:17:44 and that is the story that I was
01:17:46 telling before and allow me to share
01:17:48 it briefly now it was
01:17:50 it was just um so when I was
01:17:52 I think I was um everyone knows that
01:17:54 I was a god as a young child
01:17:56 I was the ultimate dodgeball champion
01:17:58 I was I could do 50 pull-ups in high school
01:18:00 I uh I just I
01:18:02 I had hair down to my waist I was just
01:18:04 a god just in every possible way
01:18:06 um I wore those
01:18:08 in Kingdom Hearts wristbands every day
01:18:10 um
01:18:12 that's how you know that's how you know
01:18:14 that's how you know I wore weighted
01:18:16 leg braces because I wanted to fucking be Goku
01:18:18 okay but anyway the point is um
01:18:20 I actually developed a bit of a fan
01:18:22 club in uh
01:18:24 in high school there was like three girls
01:18:26 who would call themselves this
01:18:28 and I I occasionally get creepy
01:18:30 Facebook messages from them up until
01:18:32 last year um really
01:18:34 yeah it's true I just
01:18:36 had to check uh I got back into Facebook
01:18:38 and I yeah yeah last year I got another one
01:18:40 but anyway the point is
01:18:42 because I like
01:18:44 one time okay one time
01:18:46 I mean there's that one time
01:18:48 a friend of mine walked up to me
01:18:50 and said hey Nate that's my friend
01:18:52 Jessica she wants to date you I looked up
01:18:54 I saw her and I said that's nice and went
01:18:56 back to reading like one piece or
01:18:58 or two or something that's
01:19:00 that's why did
01:19:02 why did you say that sense why was that your response
01:19:04 was like nervous or like you know
01:19:06 did you not like or were you just not
01:19:08 interested in the entire endeavor
01:19:10 at this point in my life I just had like
01:19:12 no interest in girls really
01:19:14 I mean I did have a crush on a girl but
01:19:16 I don't know it was like it was more like platonic
01:19:18 I guess like I wasn't thinking about fucking or anything
01:19:20 I don't know Jesus how I get
01:19:22 it I didn't want to fucking go back
01:19:24 I didn't want to go back to school either
01:19:26 well I did a little bit but I would have
01:19:28 been nervous about like when I was young I was
01:19:30 like legit scared of alcohol and I think I was
01:19:32 the same way kind of scared of sex because
01:19:34 like I didn't understand it was like a foreign world
01:19:36 I was like ah what does this mean
01:19:38 I thought that sex was like bad and something
01:19:40 that only like the bad kids did because
01:19:42 people weren't supposed to and I was like
01:19:44 I'm better than them because I'm not
01:19:46 doing that bad thing and I mean I was
01:19:48 a kissless virgin up until like my fucking
01:19:50 twenties so you know that was
01:19:52 weird um anyway
01:19:54 anyway so the story goes that
01:19:56 I believe it was sophomore year and
01:19:58 the talent show is coming up and I thought
01:20:00 I'm gonna fucking ace this like I ace everything
01:20:02 um and maybe
01:20:04 whatever I like
01:20:06 and just to paint the picture I took
01:20:08 all AP classes I could
01:20:10 take even when I wasn't good enough
01:20:12 to handle like I never got lower than like I don't know like a C
01:20:14 or you know the B's
01:20:16 and C's I was a student but I took all
01:20:18 AP classes because I
01:20:20 would not it would hurt me too deeply
01:20:22 in my pride to not take
01:20:24 the hardest possible classes that were available
01:20:26 even though the valedictorian herself like
01:20:28 just did not do that because there was no point
01:20:30 the point is
01:20:32 I'm characterizing myself as an asshole
01:20:34 egomaniac okay but the point is
01:20:36 uh there's a talent show
01:20:38 the talent show comes up
01:20:40 and I've decided I'm going
01:20:42 to choreograph my own dancing thing
01:20:44 and I'm gonna dance to another one bites the dust
01:20:46 and sing with Freddie Mercury and so I do that
01:20:48 I choreograph it and I get up there
01:20:50 and I sing and dance uh
01:20:52 and I they they count down
01:20:54 the who are the winners and I just think to myself
01:20:56 oh of course I'm gonna win this
01:20:58 but then I don't and it was humiliating
01:21:00 and I didn't make any sense to me and it was the worst
01:21:02 time of my life that's it
01:21:04 that's it that's it terrible
01:21:06 I thought it would give you like everyone booed you or like you made a fool of yourself
01:21:08 you didn't you know everyone well you don't understand
01:21:10 I don't care what other people think of me
01:21:12 it's only what I think other people think of me
01:21:14 that matters to me wait that doesn't make any fucking
01:21:16 sense um anyway
01:21:18 that's hard that's hard
01:21:20 it was 80% build up and and like
01:21:22 2% like oh here's
01:21:24 as all my stories are
01:21:26 like half to nothing
01:21:28 have I told the story about
01:21:30 have I told the story about thinking that I got
01:21:32 the role that I wanted to in the school play
01:21:34 but then it was actually his wife
01:21:36 that's right
01:21:38 I won't repeat it then
01:21:40 uh
01:21:42 if I could go back to talking like at the very beginning
01:21:44 oh wait mage hasn't heard it
01:21:46 okay let me say but the audience has
01:21:48 let me say it real quick real quick
01:21:50 I
01:21:52 I auditioned for a play
01:21:54 even mage doesn't want to hear it
01:21:56 no no no I do want to hear it
01:21:58 I just don't want to take up everyone's time
01:22:00 no you're not my friend anymore
01:22:04 every small audience member was probably like
01:22:06 oh you forgot about this to say
01:22:08 there are like a thousand like loose threads
01:22:10 in this podcast
01:22:12 the reason I rushed through that one because I thought
01:22:14 I had totally dropped off
01:22:16 whatever
01:22:18 I want to go back to one of the very first questions was
01:22:20 did you want to know how I became
01:22:22 the mature and by mature
01:22:24 I mean insane person you say
01:22:26 for you
01:22:28 this is where I reveal the fact that I am actually
01:22:30 the main girl from Karakana
01:22:32 but instead of being beautiful and elegant
01:22:34 I'm actually inconceivable and a maniac
01:22:36 so
01:22:38 when I was like a little kid
01:22:40 all I cared about was having like the approval
01:22:42 of like adults I didn't care about the other kids
01:22:44 that liked me I didn't care about any of that
01:22:46 all I wanted was like the praise
01:22:48 oh wow like Anthony
01:22:50 like thank you for helping me take out the trash
01:22:52 you're so responsible
01:22:54 you're so nice
01:22:56 you're such a mature kid and I'm like
01:22:58 fuck man I spent a couple of years
01:23:00 all the time I've known you you've never docked your name to me
01:23:02 now I can't be undone
01:23:04 I've said this before on the podcast
01:23:06 did you not know his name
01:23:08 no
01:23:10 I guess we know what level of friendship we're at
01:23:12 DeVu
01:23:14 anyway
01:23:16 I was so hopped up on compliments
01:23:18 I was straight up sniffing those
01:23:20 that praise day in day out
01:23:22 and so I wanted to like modify
01:23:24 my behavior so I could maximize
01:23:26 the compliments that I got
01:23:28 so I talked about this a little bit on the sitcoms episode
01:23:30 but it goes farther than this
01:23:32 I basically like there was an age at like 10 or something
01:23:34 I was like alright cartoons are kids shit
01:23:36 like I can't do cartoons anymore
01:23:38 it's all about sitcoms and like daytime television
01:23:40 that's where all the mature adults are doing
01:23:42 that's what that's what that's the new show
01:23:44 that I was hooked up on
01:23:46 I was watching Golden Girls
01:23:48 I feel like this is good because you went through this so young
01:23:50 that you got to like figure out that
01:23:52 adults were dumb before you even were one
01:23:54 yeah exactly
01:23:56 yeah how do you get out of that arc
01:23:58 that's what I want to know
01:24:00 well a funny thing
01:24:02 I found this little thing called the horseshoe crew
01:24:04 that were just like talking like
01:24:06 in like my little pony and shit
01:24:08 so I was in that like whole scene
01:24:10 and eventually I was realizing you know I quite like
01:24:12 when things were like drawn
01:24:14 and it's that sort of like
01:24:16 metamorphicized into me being okay
01:24:18 with the fact that I am a child
01:24:20 and I was like completely like reversed
01:24:22 where like a long time of my life
01:24:24 where like I was like from like 8 until like
01:24:26 I don't know like 12 or 13
01:24:28 where I was really dedicated to trying to become
01:24:30 like not necessarily a mature person
01:24:32 in the sense that like I'm like
01:24:34 you know like like a serious all tax person
01:24:36 in the sense that like I'm you know
01:24:38 I'm the cream of the crop of kids like wow
01:24:40 is that part of why you were so
01:24:42 into homestuck because it was like
01:24:44 all cartoony and kitty but also like
01:24:46 really cerebral and literary
01:24:48 a little bit yeah
01:24:50 anyway it went full circle to the point where now
01:24:52 I'm like full like
01:24:54 kid power and I reject
01:24:56 all sense of the adult world
01:24:58 I just want to go back
01:25:00 not like I just want to go back to like being
01:25:02 like nice and like looking
01:25:04 with optimism to the world and not being
01:25:06 nihilistic and not being like oh like
01:25:08 life shit now question mark
01:25:10 I don't want to be reflecting like oh how good
01:25:12 things used to be I want to have things be good
01:25:14 now I don't want to be thinking about how
01:25:16 like oh YouTube so bad oh I'm just
01:25:18 here to make a quick buck oh
01:25:20 like like online creation is
01:25:22 such a fucking drag oh they're all

01:25:44 about that shit I'm here I'm
01:25:46 full of energy and passion I'm here

01:26:04 you don't fucking get it we've grown past you
01:26:06 we have evolved past you we have did you
01:26:08 evolve you have mega evolved and you are
01:26:10 fucking old shit you are old hat you don't
01:26:12 get it anymore leave literally
01:26:14 leave yeah dude yeah
01:26:16 like yeah talking about
01:26:18 being rebellious against what
01:26:20 people want you to be when you're older
01:26:22 oh you'll get over this you'll get over that
01:26:24 the number one thing that I wanted to be
01:26:26 rebellious against was thinking that my
01:26:28 childhood was better right like
01:26:30 there was a time when I was like 17
01:26:32 and an older person said oh yeah I remember
01:26:34 when I was your age that was the best years of
01:26:36 my life and I'm thinking gross
01:26:38 one I'm I was thinking one
01:26:40 I've just been sitting around doing nothing with
01:26:42 my life being completely miserable two
01:26:44 how old were you how old were you 17 or 16
01:26:46 Jesus fucking Christ two
01:26:48 uh this guy
01:26:50 in like his late 50s is
01:26:52 fucking handing me the free sample at a
01:26:54 grocery store obviously
01:26:56 this guy yeah well
01:26:58 when when when when you peak
01:27:00 at 17 when you're the kind of person who
01:27:02 peaked at 17 and it never got any better past
01:27:04 that that's not a good sign what do you think
01:27:06 he was handing me the fucking free sample
01:27:08 at price chopper so
01:27:10 I was thinking yeah it's like clearly
01:27:12 people who just were not fit for this
01:27:14 earth like they should have died they should have died young
01:27:16 that was been the only way right
01:27:18 yeah yeah that was the only way
01:27:20 and they missed they missed their chance that's the two
01:27:22 things I still want to talk about is like life
01:27:24 getting better or worse when you become old and
01:27:26 also the death of going outside which I guess
01:27:28 actually need that much elaboration but those
01:27:30 are the two subtopics I'm still particularly
01:27:32 interested in
01:27:34 I just like to say
01:27:36 that I'm deeply sorry about how much I
01:27:38 fucked up my story because I told it like
01:27:40 shit yeah I
01:27:42 thought I had not I thought I told
01:27:44 it on episode so I rushed to the ending I just
01:27:46 want everyone to know it was really good when
01:27:48 I told it in private
01:27:50 for you maybe as you said yeah
01:27:52 in the call and you did say and it was
01:27:54 like a really like fun story that like wow
01:27:56 yeah you know I'm glad that you're my friend
01:27:58 like I'm really glad that I but not anymore
01:28:00 yeah you really
01:28:02 now I see how you handle it under
01:28:04 pressure I'm not confident
01:28:06 it's actual quality
01:28:08 I'm told it on the episode before
01:28:10 right
01:28:12 yeah yeah there was a little hype
01:28:14 as to the reveal of that
01:28:16 I had lost that that was what made it good
01:28:18 if you had actually been performed
01:28:20 the same thing you played the song
01:28:22 you sang it we had to sit there be like yep you
01:28:24 definitely lost it
01:28:26 if I did it on the episode yeah that
01:28:28 we should do that I mean it was a dance thing
01:28:30 we would just hear a foot shuffle
01:28:32 yeah I did moonwalk did moonwalk
01:28:34 you haven't seen Fuli Kuli yet have you
01:28:36 no I would like to request you watch that
01:28:38 and we could maybe do like a whole fucking
01:28:40 because everybody else has seen it we could do a whole thing
01:28:42 it's good for me that's true
01:28:44 me on Chibi Bakas Fuli Kuli
01:28:46 the arc of the main character of Fuli Kuli
01:28:48 is that he basically
01:28:50 like is trying to grow up
01:28:52 like he wants to be an adult
01:28:54 and he wants to he sees the adults around
01:28:56 him as like failing because they're all
01:28:58 like kind of immature and he's like
01:29:00 oh you're supposed to act like this like this is what
01:29:02 it means to be an adult and then it's kind of about him
01:29:04 realizing that you don't need to do
01:29:06 that and that adults generally
01:29:08 being an adult does not mean you're like a radically different
01:29:10 person it just means that you have like a lot
01:29:12 more responsibilities basically he tries to be
01:29:14 cool but instead he's a fool
01:29:16 that's the title
01:29:18 exactly my life where I was super
01:29:20 like it was super inspired by all the
01:29:22 like adults around me and not like in the sense that
01:29:24 like I really like liked what they were doing
01:29:26 but just in the sense that they were authority figures
01:29:28 and so by default I looked up
01:29:30 and I felt that that's what they were doing
01:29:32 was the correct thing to do
01:29:34 like I didn't have any role models
01:29:36 like my dad is a very good
01:29:38 mature person and he's like
01:29:40 cool in his own way but like he's not the kind of cool that
01:29:42 I look up to in a way if you know what I mean
01:29:44 so like I remember specifically
01:29:46 as a child thinking I remember
01:29:48 specifically out loud thinking this
01:29:50 like you thinking it out loud like not subconsciously
01:29:52 like this was something that actually went through my head
01:29:54 sitting there thinking I have
01:29:56 I look up to no one there's no one
01:29:58 who I respect until I found the internet
01:30:00 then only on the internet did I start
01:30:02 finding things I respect and then learning
01:30:04 things about people who aren't on the internet
01:30:06 like a reverse MC mat
01:30:08 I never sort of looked up to any adult either
01:30:10 like people my friends had
01:30:12 idols and stuff like Britney Spears was super popular
01:30:14 back then I remember specifically
01:30:16 thinking to myself like
01:30:18 why would I want to be like someone else
01:30:20 when I can just be me you know
01:30:22 it's just that you never made sense to me
01:30:24 to try and be like someone else
01:30:26 that seemed like hard and what's the point
01:30:28 if there's nothing missing in my life
01:30:30 I only admired fictional characters
01:30:32 I want to
01:30:34 I want to express deeply that this is
01:30:36 this is a very shameful praise
01:30:38 this is a very shameful inspiration
01:30:40 because I don't like actually
01:30:42 like feel like I want to follow
01:30:44 the footsteps or like believe in
01:30:46 the qualities of the adults around me
01:30:48 like like no the adults around me
01:30:50 I'm really like you know what like I want to take up that mental
01:30:52 I want to do what you're doing I'm not like inspired
01:30:54 in the same way that I'm inspired like people online
01:30:56 it's just because they were like the adults
01:30:58 around me and because they're adults
01:31:00 they know what they're doing
01:31:02 it's instilled in me
01:31:04 I'm really curious about this
01:31:06 because you are a big lad
01:31:08 and I'm wondering like
01:31:10 how being like maybe
01:31:12 as tall as the adults
01:31:14 around you affected the way
01:31:16 you look up to them metaphorically
01:31:18 because I have
01:31:20 as a small boy
01:31:22 like knowing that people like obviously
01:31:24 you're a kid people who are bigger than you
01:31:26 are in charge and that's how you
01:31:28 understand it and
01:31:30 but like I've noticed like a couple
01:31:32 times even though there's like a kid who's like
01:31:34 clearly he's like a young teenager
01:31:36 but he's taller than me I feel like
01:31:38 this inherent like
01:31:40 oh he's in charge
01:31:42 not that I actually act on that in any way
01:31:44 but I'm like it's like for a brief moment
01:31:46 I'm like oh
01:31:48 wait no he's a kid he's a kid
01:31:50 I'm cooler than him
01:31:52 I don't really get that
01:31:54 I kind of feel like once you are tall
01:31:56 like that power dynamic of tall
01:31:58 versus small kind of disappears
01:32:00 because I really like even when I'm talking to
01:32:02 someone who's significantly shorter than me
01:32:04 I don't like think about it or like even
01:32:06 realize it most of the time
01:32:08 that's your tall privilege
01:32:10 that's your tall privilege talking
01:32:12 that's tall privilege you have the privilege
01:32:14 of not noticing
01:32:16 us manlets have to notice
01:32:18 where it's forced upon us
01:32:20 being tall is not what it's all cracked up to be
01:32:22 what I hated about being
01:32:24 taller than everyone else
01:32:26 it's just practical and I like
01:32:28 I mean there's some good points but what I really hated
01:32:30 when I was a kid I was usually
01:32:32 the tallest kid in any friend group
01:32:34 or even among like boys
01:32:36 and stuff
01:32:38 so whenever we hung out and whenever people
01:32:40 got in trouble I usually got the brunt
01:32:42 of the blame because people assumed I'm the oldest
01:32:44 and the most responsible because I was the tallest
01:32:46 even though that wasn't the case
01:32:48 I was once hanging out with
01:32:50 like two other boys
01:32:52 and they were throwing rocks
01:32:54 at a sign and they were
01:32:56 throwing rocks at a sign and
01:32:58 this old dude he went up
01:33:00 to us like he sneaked up on us and he
01:33:02 grabbed my arm and like
01:33:04 the two guys scattered
01:33:06 that's grounds for salt
01:33:08 and the two boys just completely
01:33:10 ran for their lives
01:33:12 and I got a big lecture and I was like
01:33:14 oh you're the oldest you should be more responsible
01:33:16 to set example and stuff like that
01:33:18 and I was the youngest of the group
01:33:20 and I was so pissed
01:33:22 he still is cognizant of this
01:33:24 sort of like bestial, fucking
01:33:26 primal power dynamic just from height
01:33:28 and physical stature but like you can be aware
01:33:30 of it and then like not let it affect you
01:33:32 much but especially over the course of your development
01:33:34 it can put you into a feedback
01:33:36 loop and I
01:33:38 based on how people treat me
01:33:40 and talk to me I think most people think
01:33:42 I'm usually three to five years
01:33:44 younger than I am and it was only in the
01:33:46 last couple of years I've started like
01:33:48 getting people treating me like I'm definitely
01:33:50 an adult like after
01:33:52 I spent like a solid year driving and
01:33:54 having a full-time job and like being
01:33:56 completely independent only then
01:33:58 did I seem to have enough swagger
01:34:00 where like people think okay this is like an actual
01:34:02 fucking person like at a store
01:34:04 not like they're with their parents you know what I mean
01:34:06 it's catch-de-vous swaggering
01:34:08 the fuck out of the grocery store
01:34:10 yeah yeah
01:34:12 even up until like my like early
01:34:14 20s even when I was like 21
01:34:16 people would still talk to me like I was in high school
01:34:18 or even say like oh
01:34:20 like think I was in high school right
01:34:22 and when people treat you like that it affects
01:34:24 yourself image so Munchie
01:34:26 meanwhile who's passed for an adult for a long
01:34:28 fucking time and creates this fucking feedback loop
01:34:30 and I think it's a good one
01:34:32 if people think you're an adult unless you're just
01:34:34 nothing but slapped with blame for throwing rocks at you
01:34:36 Munchie's a trans he's a trans adult
01:34:38 he passes
01:34:40 here's the best thing in life and here's
01:34:42 like the thing that like I'm gonna be turning 18 soon
01:34:44 and this is gonna that's gonna be like
01:34:46 the death of my actual life like everything
01:34:48 after that will be nothing because I define
01:34:50 my life as the following
01:34:52 as long as
01:34:54 I can walk up to a cashier
01:34:56 or you know where or my mom
01:34:58 my mom can introduce me to someone
01:35:00 and she can say how old
01:35:02 do you think he is and she can gesture to him
01:35:04 words at me and they can be like
01:35:06 um 22 some guy said
01:35:08 like 28 like everyone has
01:35:10 like like the
01:35:12 gap between my actual age
01:35:14 and uh my
01:35:16 like what people think my age is as long as
01:35:18 that is at least 10 years plus
01:35:20 I'm in the prime of my life as long as
01:35:22 people think that I'm
01:35:24 older than I actually am that's when I know
01:35:26 that I'm like wherever I can walk up to a fucking cashier
01:35:28 or just the other fucking day
01:35:30 when I was getting my passport done
01:35:32 uh the uh the receptionist
01:35:34 the receptionist was like oh
01:35:36 what are you like 22 I'm like
01:35:40 some people get upset some people get upset
01:35:42 because they get older and people stop
01:35:44 carding them at liquor stores
01:35:46 Munchie never got carded
01:35:48 I'll get offered alcohol
01:35:50 all the time and I'll have that
01:35:52 fucking moment I praise this I live
01:35:54 for this I wake up specifically for
01:35:56 this they'll come by and like
01:35:58 would you like a drink and I'm like
01:36:00 I want to know
01:36:02 I'm underage I'm not
01:36:04 allowed to drink alcohol
01:36:06 the sadistic glee that
01:36:08 he says that
01:36:10 he's been waiting to
01:36:12 say this I was surprised Munchie that you're still
01:36:14 against sex that'd be the ultimate the ultimate
01:36:16 prank like after she gets up it's like
01:36:18 I have to let you know something
01:36:20 criminal
01:36:22 I'm underage
01:36:24 that's terrible
01:36:26 that's a great party trick
01:36:28 Munchie's story reminded me
01:36:30 like a little bit what my parents
01:36:32 like to do like whenever they have
01:36:34 used to whenever they used
01:36:36 to have like friends over
01:36:38 the ones they haven't seen in years
01:36:40 so I have a sister older sister by the
01:36:42 way so like
01:36:44 when these
01:36:46 friends would be had been over
01:36:48 I used to be like a little baby and stuff like
01:36:50 that so like my parents
01:36:52 would go like this like let me introduce you to
01:36:54 my littlest one and I was
01:36:56 the tallest person in the room
01:36:58 it was pretty fun
01:37:00 nice
01:37:02 it's fucking beautiful
01:37:04 before we wrap up here
01:37:06 I feel like that's what could happen
01:37:08 I just want to like clarify my
01:37:10 transition here so you can
01:37:12 understand my growing pains
01:37:14 when I say
01:37:16 that I was trying to be mature as like a kid
01:37:18 you may think but Munchie you're so fucking
01:37:20 inconceivable you're just
01:37:22 unfathomable the way that you are
01:37:24 in the sense that you're fucking autistic and retarded
01:37:26 and I hate you like all you do is scream
01:37:28 and thank you viewer like good job
01:37:30 and like thumbs up and thank you
01:37:32 but what I mean is I don't mean like particularly like I was trying to be like
01:37:34 really like serious in the sense
01:37:36 that like real world like
01:37:38 adults would recognize me as an adult
01:37:40 I would like play you know
01:37:42 I would play along and I wouldn't be like a weird
01:37:44 autistic person in real life but I just
01:37:46 mean that I wanted to have the praise of adults
01:37:48 in any scenario so when I was around
01:37:50 people online I would you know
01:37:52 I would act mature in the sense that I would
01:37:54 make funny jokes that's really what it
01:37:56 translate to was I would make funny jokes
01:37:58 and it would be as Steve puts it
01:38:00 on point
01:38:02 so I wouldn't
01:38:04 be fucking like I wouldn't be like a fucking
01:38:06 spur lord but I would be autistic
01:38:08 is what I'm trying to say
01:38:10 and he is to this very day
01:38:12 you guys get it am I explaining myself well
01:38:14 I'm not I'm not I'm not being a
01:38:16 weird like uh like faggot
01:38:18 who only like like dresses in suits
01:38:20 I'm just being I'm just being the kind of guy
01:38:22 that people would unironically praise
01:38:24 for being cool that's what I was
01:38:26 that's what I was like chasing after my life
01:38:28 and I felt the way to do that was to try and be like
01:38:30 mature in the context of whatever
01:38:32 scenario that I was in be it like an actual
01:38:34 like real adult or a funny
01:38:36 person online I can only imagine
01:38:38 munchy in that hamburger onesie
01:38:40 that's that's that's all he
01:38:44 whatever that was still
01:38:46 me trying to be cool whatever my teeth is like
01:38:48 I go to the store I just imagine munchy
01:38:50 with that hamburger onesie in a store
01:38:52 yes I am an adult
01:38:54 I wear the out of the house not in conceivable
01:38:56 amount of time like I wear that like pretty regularly
01:38:58 outside the house like like downtown
01:39:00 incidentally it's a it's a pizza onesie
01:39:02 with the burger like jacket
01:39:04 thing but by the way I'm so
01:39:06 upset with you did you like I'm
01:39:08 so distraught every time I remember
01:39:10 that like okay
01:39:12 here's what my intention was I don't think everybody
01:39:14 can use you but I want this to be the case
01:39:16 when I left like on accident
01:39:18 the burger burger was
01:39:20 right there and I gave it to you like
01:39:22 I didn't want you to ship it I wanted to be
01:39:24 that to be like little Cal from Homestuck
01:39:26 like I passed it to you then you used it
01:39:28 and then like you threw it away but you just
01:39:30 have that you threw it away into a trash can
01:39:32 that was that was going directly to a landfill in
01:39:34 Chicago and then Nate while surfing
01:39:36 on the web aka the trash can
01:39:38 to find some sick pumps
01:39:40 he would find it and would just like transfer
01:39:42 from PCP member to PCP member
01:39:44 appearing the background of videos until the end
01:39:46 of time and have its own narrative arc until
01:39:48 finally you returned to me at the end of like
01:39:50 a conclusion of an art but tragically the
01:39:52 only thing that gets transferred around here is
01:39:54 YouTube wait so who does
01:39:56 have the burger thing right now you
01:39:58 I thought I gave it back to you or something
01:40:00 no you have it's gone it's
01:40:02 lost it's it's oh god damn
01:40:04 it yep it's
01:40:06 it's iconic
01:40:08 you should never have trusted digit hold on
01:40:10 to that this is your mistake I mean it's
01:40:12 possible to say in my house somewhere
01:40:14 I don't please you had it
01:40:16 when you were going around the country
01:40:18 oh god in that
01:40:20 period I had returned it to you
01:40:22 no like at anime
01:40:24 visit me yeah I did
01:40:26 at anime expo I had oh no
01:40:28 you did not give it to me well
01:40:30 I'll have to either find it or find
01:40:32 out who has it
01:40:34 wear it you have to wear it maybe it's currently
01:40:36 going on its own like little cow
01:40:38 it's very let's hope so
01:40:40 let's hope so if it somehow
01:40:42 found its way into the giant
01:40:44 goodwill throw away all the clothes
01:40:46 I think that
01:40:48 happened like a year ago then that would
01:40:50 be where it is but okay great
01:40:52 I'm really happy about that
01:40:54 well hey this is life
01:40:56 anyway let's move on okay guys
01:40:58 we're done with this childhood is gay we've
01:41:00 settled that moving on it's time
01:41:02 to feed begin our
01:41:04 before we we actually get to the thing
01:41:06 there's an announcement about a big change
01:41:08 happening with PCP right now
01:41:10 and it's relevant to this coming up section
01:41:12 here's the deal everybody we are flipping
01:41:14 our recording and releasing episode
01:41:16 days from now on we're releasing
01:41:18 a pcb episodes on
01:41:20 Friday wait the same time

01:41:24 on Sunday it's because bed
01:41:26 we want to do a thing where we can respond
01:41:28 to the latest episode that just came out
01:41:30 and actually be talking about
01:41:32 what people are still talking about
01:41:34 and flipping that one little thing will allow
01:41:36 us to do that so that we can be
01:41:38 on top of our shit
01:41:40 responding to the new episode that came out
01:41:42 and we can be fucking timely with this stuff
01:41:44 that's the reason that's that this
01:41:46 is a small change for us and
01:41:48 just make releasing on Friday
01:41:50 really all you need to give a shit about
01:41:52 and so now we'll be doing the ask questions on Sunday

01:41:56 this change is being carried away by security
01:41:58 no way
01:42:00 it doesn't really matter at all it's just
01:42:02 you know people expect them on Friday
01:42:04 possibly including this one I don't know
01:42:06 I'd be speaking of
01:42:08 shit from last episode on fitness
01:42:10 that came out
01:42:12 there was a huge response
01:42:14 to hashtag PCP fit life
01:42:16 and we got a ton of fucking people
01:42:18 working out and going to the gym and taking a walk
01:42:20 there was one guy that was just like in the woods
01:42:22 just hanging out just hanging out in the fucking woods
01:42:24 yeah
01:42:26 simply beautiful
01:42:28 we're gonna have to make some like merch
01:42:30 like a PCP tank top
01:42:32 so we can get people in there
01:42:34 dude I would love to go to the gym with a PCP
01:42:36 fit life tank top or something
01:42:38 that'd be fucking sick
01:42:40 we'll fucking do something like that
01:42:42 we should definitely do that
01:42:44 I don't know if they have tank tops on redbubble
01:42:46 but we could definitely figure something out
01:42:48 PCP fit life is the way the truth and the light though
01:42:50 we need to make this real
01:42:52 and revisit it
01:42:54 by the way I mean I guess on the subject of the PCP fit life
01:42:56 I've been working out
01:42:58 things have been going good
01:43:00 I've been lowering my sugar intake
01:43:02 I'm still avoiding all sugar
01:43:04 and life is good
01:43:06 I'm doing uh... I'm going keto
01:43:08 I'm going keto
01:43:10 really, really
01:43:12 I gotta lose like 20 pounds
01:43:14 I gained like 20 pounds
01:43:16 I'm mad about it
01:43:18 go load it up
01:43:20 this is a diet right Ben?
01:43:22 yeah, yeah
01:43:24 is that real?
01:43:26 you just go
01:43:28 really low carb for a while
01:43:30 that's pretty much all this
01:43:32 do your raccoon tendencies
01:43:34 I give this a week
01:43:36 no
01:43:38 no, I think this is pretty easy
01:43:40 I think this will actually be pretty easy
01:43:42 it's not difficult to do keto
01:43:44 especially for someone like Ben who can live off of like
01:43:46 peanuts for 10 days
01:43:48 just only eat meat
01:43:50 digi, yesterday
01:43:52 the only thing I ate was a bag of peanuts
01:43:54 no way, no fucking way
01:43:56 do you not still have any carbs do they?
01:43:58 they have a bit
01:44:00 but Ben, what about your, I mean they do have protein
01:44:02 but what of your
01:44:04 omega-3's? what of your vitamins?
01:44:06 oh wait, I have a jar
01:44:08 I have a jar of fish oil pills somewhere
01:44:10 ah, perfect
01:44:12 I'll eat the entire jar
01:44:14 as one puck, what was it?
01:44:16 it melts them together
01:44:18 didn't we name that something last episode?
01:44:20 it was like the
01:44:22 Ben C or something
01:44:24 no, wait, it was the so ugly
01:44:26 it was the so ugly
01:44:28 the log of
01:44:30 it was worth it, I don't even regret doing that
01:44:32 I recommend, in fact I recommend it
01:44:34 excellent
01:44:36 I mean, that's really it
01:44:38 we just wanted to talk about how awesome it was
01:44:40 that people were actually sticking with this fit life
01:44:42 we got a bunch of, so many pictures
01:44:44 and shit, people were tweeting me
01:44:46 people were tweeting the pcp itself
01:44:48 we retweeted a lot of them, so keep tweeting
01:44:50 at tpcrasnators with their hashtag
01:44:52 pcpfitlife and we'll
01:44:54 fucking retweet them, we'll start a
01:44:56 sensation and save the world from
01:44:58 obesity and being gross
01:45:00 oh my god, all the questions are
01:45:02 actually relevant to the topic
01:45:04 in this episode, the questions are good
01:45:06 they're not bad, and they're pretty decent
01:45:08 but before we get to that, we got other shit to do
01:45:10 whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
01:45:12 okay, fine, whatever, I'll talk about it
01:45:14 when we get through it
01:45:16 so the next up is, it's the pcp
01:45:18 theme contest everybody, that's
01:45:20 still going, it's real
01:45:22 and last episode, there were two entries
01:45:24 now that we got like fucking six this time
01:45:26 we got a whole bunch of fucking pcp themes
01:45:28 I want to see what the retention weight for the
01:45:30 pcp is, because I guarantee you
01:45:32 and now on to like
01:45:34 90% viewers click off
01:45:36 well that's fine, we can totally gauge that
01:45:38 and if we know
01:45:40 then so be it, but
01:45:42 we won't change anything
01:45:44 we won't change a thing, why do you think that
01:45:46 because I've always listened
01:45:48 I've never thought the question section was any worse than
01:45:50 the show itself
01:45:52 I always love the question section
01:45:54 I agree, I don't see why anyone, I mean maybe
01:45:56 at the very end when we say like
01:45:58 I mean the show is just random
01:46:00 discussion, like it's never like
01:46:02 a completely on topic or a
01:46:04 complete view of the topic
01:46:06 most of the time the questions are just like
01:46:08 these questions suck, oh here's
01:46:10 what's your favorite anime and then all of us grow
01:46:12 and be like oh yeah we usually just don't
01:46:14 answer any of the bad questions
01:46:16 and just find the good ones
01:46:18 isn't that what we usually do
01:46:20 I don't think it's ever had like a real
01:46:22 problem
01:46:24 other than not having enough good questions
01:46:26 well in any
01:46:28 case that is dead and irrelevant
01:46:30 because it's time to talk about pcp themes
01:46:32 now, we're all going to fucking listen
01:46:34 so get your asses into the pcp themes chat
01:46:36 we're going to listen to all of them
01:46:38 thank you for sending us a link
01:46:40 to twitter, we can't fucking play this
01:46:42 with our music box, we literally said
01:46:44 to make it soundcloud and youtube
01:46:46 you have fucked up, I don't know
01:46:48 how you did it this bad, what made you think
01:46:50 that we could, like that we were going to watch
01:46:52 a video on twitter, who
01:46:54 post videos on twitter
01:46:56 for the first one I guess we'll all just have to hit play
01:46:58 at the same time, jeez Christ
01:47:00 is this the one from
01:47:02 Gavin Watkins?
01:47:04 that's right, that's right
01:47:06 alright, here we go
01:47:08 remember everybody tweet us
01:47:10 hashtag pcp
01:47:12 you need to read the part where he says
01:47:14 this is an indirect recording
01:47:16 of the theme
01:47:18 if you like, I can give you a direct
01:47:20 file so the sound quality is much better
01:47:22 what? oh fucking
01:47:24 wait a minute, if I remember correctly
01:47:26 I listened to this earlier and it sounds like
01:47:28 it was like a cell phone
01:47:30 recording out of the speakers playing
01:47:32 that's so stupid
01:47:34 let's not even listen to this one
01:47:36 what a terrible
01:47:38 dude, you gotta put that on
01:47:40 soundcloud or youtube or something
01:47:42 wait, stop
01:47:44 let's think about this for a second
01:47:46 he has a music file
01:47:48 a computer file
01:47:50 which he then decides to
01:47:52 record digitally
01:47:54 with a microphone
01:47:56 and then upload that file
01:47:58 I actually have a development
01:48:00 on this developing story
01:48:02 because I actually did communicate with this guy
01:48:04 and get him to send me a file
01:48:06 but here's the thing
01:48:08 the file that he sent
01:48:10 I gotta pull up this
01:48:12 email that he sent because it was fucking fascinating
01:48:14 listen to this
01:48:16 ok, so he said hey guys
01:48:18 you retweet my song, that's cool
01:48:20 ok, sorry, so he attached a file
01:48:22 to this, it says sorry if I accidentally
01:48:24 sent you the wrong file
01:48:26 I'm in a setup stage for my computer
01:48:28 and I haven't set up the sound yet
01:48:30 but I'm pretty sure this is the right file
01:48:32 I also, listen to this
01:48:34 actually accidentally
01:48:36 deleted the one from twitter
01:48:38 so I spent a while trying to recreate it
01:48:40 as best I could
01:48:42 while changing some things
01:48:44 how many things went wrong
01:48:46 in this process
01:48:48 he made the song in whatever
01:48:50 program, saved it
01:48:52 uploaded it to twitter, deleted the
01:48:54 master file and all other files
01:48:56 and the only form that existed
01:48:58 was the one on twitter
01:49:00 and then it was deleted from twitter
01:49:02 it's like that time that digi deleted every piece
01:49:04 of his video, so he couldn't recreate it
01:49:06 before the fucking
01:49:08 you know, before the video was upload
01:49:10 are we gonna listen to it?
01:49:12 I am downloading an AIF file
01:49:14 that was attached to it right now
01:49:16 upload it to soundcloud or youtube
01:49:18 we have to be strict, we're gonna get people
01:49:20 sending it on fucking crazy shit
01:49:22 we're gonna get people on mega upload
01:49:24 okay, I can hear sound from this
01:49:26 but no one else can hear it put me
01:49:28 so you gotta fix this buddy
01:49:30 you gotta put this on twitter
01:49:32 or fucking whatever, I apologize
01:49:34 cause I told him just to send it to us
01:49:36 no, you gotta put it on youtube or soundcloud
01:49:38 or something, the end
01:49:40 alright, now we're gonna play fucking one
01:49:42 by Eric Seabass
01:49:44 it's called Crazy
01:49:48 alright, shit this is alright
01:49:54 oh my god
01:50:08 I know
01:50:10 okay, that was pretty dope
01:50:12 that was really cool
01:50:14 it's pretty dope, but it's not
01:50:16 this is the aesthetic of the pc
01:50:18 this could be a jingle for
01:50:20 literally anything
01:50:22 it was a little long
01:50:24 I think it was a little redundant at the end
01:50:26 for a theme song
01:50:28 this is entirely
01:50:30 misguided section
01:50:32 I don't understand
01:50:34 okay, no one is going
01:50:36 all the ones that we've had so far
01:50:38 are not like
01:50:40 PCP matching tonally
01:50:42 stylistically or anything
01:50:44 we should have just made our own
01:50:46 fucking theme song
01:50:48 who's gonna fucking do that
01:50:50 we already have one
01:50:52 I don't understand why we're even
01:50:54 like why not just use the one
01:50:56 we already have
01:50:58 because you fucking cowards were saying how you
01:51:00 didn't kick it match the tone
01:51:02 I said that the
01:51:04 using it as an opening
01:51:06 was a bad idea, it was perfectly fine
01:51:08 as the ending, it just doesn't make sense
01:51:10 as an opening song
01:51:12 that's the point, we're looking for an opening
01:51:14 we decided we didn't want to do the intros
01:51:16 so I took it upon myself to put a clip
01:51:18 of the theme song at the beginning
01:51:20 and did you found it offensive that it would play the song
01:51:22 at the beginning of the podcast
01:51:24 at no point
01:51:26 was my encouragement that we create
01:51:28 a new intro song
01:51:30 I don't like the idea of an intro song on a podcast
01:51:32 it works out like the dick show
01:51:34 if it's super iconic
01:51:36 just like the worst podcast in the world, the dick show
01:51:38 thank god they don't have an opening song
01:51:40 but their opening song is like
01:51:42 not only is it extremely unique
01:51:44 but the fact that he yells yeah over it
01:51:46 whoa, so you're telling me there's like a good way
01:51:48 to do an opening song
01:51:50 no way, no way
01:51:52 if only we could
01:51:54 have some sort of competition to like do that
01:51:56 I should get residuals every time you use that
01:51:58 oh there he is
01:52:00 oh my god
01:52:02 your residuals were getting paid for being on episode
01:52:04 Jesse you're residuals
01:52:06 I'm owed money for my song
01:52:08 Jesse if you don't want us to edit
01:52:10 you're gonna have to sync with us at the end
01:52:12 anyway to get off the lofty
01:52:14 philosophical abstraction
01:52:16 remember the last time Davoo tried to kick Jesse
01:52:18 from the PCP episode
01:52:20 to make it funny I'm leaving
01:52:22 wait please get us your audio we need it
01:52:24 yeah that'd be good
01:52:26 that'd be helpful
01:52:28 listen
01:52:30 next song
01:52:32 what do people want
01:52:34 like what kind of
01:52:36 what do we want out of this
01:52:38 yeah I am actually
01:52:40 I've been trying to
01:52:42 shut up I would like some funny
01:52:44 like a couple of funny
01:52:46 joke lyric lines
01:52:48 that are about the PCP
01:52:50 no that's exactly the opposite of what I would want
01:52:52 thanks man
01:52:54 I like having a unique opening
01:52:56 on every video
01:52:58 why are we not doing that anymore
01:53:00 that was voted down
01:53:02 the reason why we stopped doing it
01:53:04 is because the intros were
01:53:06 shit like for the past like 30 episodes
01:53:08 of intros it was just like
01:53:10 google search the word of what the episode is
01:53:12 ok well then let's not do
01:53:14 a shitty low effort version
01:53:16 and just do the good ones we used to do then
01:53:18 no one will do that
01:53:20 the editors don't want to do that
01:53:22 you guys make a shit load of money editing this thing
01:53:24 I don't care what you want to do
01:53:26 make the show good
01:53:28 when the intros were forced
01:53:30 when they were obligatory
01:53:32 they were uninspired and bad
01:53:34 that's what happened
01:53:36 luckily we found a solution
01:53:38 to make a good theme song
01:53:40 like here we are
01:53:42 doing the solution
01:53:44 let's just keep going shall we
01:53:46 here's the fucking next one
01:53:48 I'm not done talking about this one guys
01:53:50 I just don't think this is a good solution to the problem
01:53:52 god I have to pee so much
01:53:54 I want to talk about the one we already listened to
01:53:56 the one we already listened to
01:53:58 not into generic rock
01:54:00 guitar shredding even if it's good
01:54:02 shredding playing whatever the fuck word I'm supposed to use
01:54:04 even if it's well mixed
01:54:06 I know most podcasts
01:54:08 they think that's the standard
01:54:10 basically have basic instrumentation
01:54:12 and it's well mixed
01:54:14 I want something more particular and original
01:54:16 I already have zero punctuation in my life
01:54:18 I watch lots of the other escapist shows
01:54:20 and I also listen to the biggest problem
01:54:22 I'm completely full
01:54:24 of
01:54:26 competent guitar playing
01:54:28 but listen to this though
01:54:30 this is an important fact you should know
01:54:32 no one here has veto power
01:54:34 it likes to accept one person
01:54:36 it could definitely be used
01:54:38 this is a group decision
01:54:40 it's a democratic process
01:54:42 if everyone wants to have bad taste and pick a bad song
01:54:44 me and digi are both
01:54:46 against generic guitar pieces
01:54:48 that last one was absolute no
01:54:50 for me because it literally sounds like
01:54:52 every other podcast intro
01:54:54 and it was not distinctive
01:54:56 there's no melody that's going to stick in your head
01:54:58 I definitely want something more distinct
01:55:00 it has some sort of strong
01:55:02 melodic
01:55:04 easily chordable thing that you could burst in the song
01:55:06 almost like if you had a cool outro
01:55:08 like I'm supposed to
01:55:10 it is a great outro
01:55:12 this is not about
01:55:14 an outro
01:55:16 this is about an intro
01:55:18 we shouldn't have an opening
01:55:20 we shouldn't have an opening
01:55:22 the show should not have an opening
01:55:24 it should either just start
01:55:26 I've literally been
01:55:28 against this
01:55:30 against the beginning of this idea
01:55:32 that is fucking bullshit
01:55:34 you never said shit
01:55:36 at the very beginning of this being an idea
01:55:38 I said I will not be a part of this
01:55:40 I will go along with the group
01:55:42 but I have not been on board
01:55:44 that may be true
01:55:46 but I don't believe it
01:55:48 I'm somewhere in the middle on this
01:55:50 I'm willing
01:55:52 I'm more cooperative with the synth idea
01:55:54 I'm optimistic to see what they can come up with
01:55:56 but
01:55:58 even at the beginning if they're all bad
01:56:00 that's what I'm saying
01:56:02 I am prepared to say no to all of them
01:56:04 because I know making a good song is damn near impossible
01:56:06 even for highly talented individuals
01:56:08 no offense
01:56:10 do we want to see if one of these guys
01:56:12 is somehow not going to part
01:56:14 it's my dank lord
01:56:16 here we go
01:56:18 hahahaha
01:56:20 whoa
01:56:22 I actually like this one a lot
01:56:24 okay
01:56:26 I don't want this
01:56:28 for the intro
01:56:30 but I do want it
01:56:32 wait
01:56:34 if you leave a comment before the video
01:56:36 and please kill yourself
01:56:38 yeah
01:56:40 there is no such thing
01:56:42 as objective criticism
01:56:44 yeah
01:56:46 I know why
01:56:48 anime is a Japanese colloquialism
01:56:50 what will we see
01:56:52 dude
01:56:54 dictionary
01:56:56 if you want to make your cries
01:56:58 consciousness high
01:57:00 then you should try
01:57:02 pcb pcb
01:57:04 yeah
01:57:06 okay
01:57:08 pcb pcb
01:57:10 now they're here to fight for me and you
01:57:12 pcb pcb
01:57:14 pcb pcb
01:57:16 the best guy ever met some other people
01:57:18 too
01:57:20 hahahaha
01:57:22 hahahaha
01:57:24 hahahaha
01:57:26 oh man
01:57:28 she has weaponized thickness
01:57:30 so much
01:57:32 that was lame
01:57:34 it's nothing but trash
01:57:36 whoa those tits
01:57:38 I love those tits so much
01:57:40 use that homestuck fuck with that homestuck suck
01:57:42 page and death is the piece
01:57:44 welcome
01:57:46 free pcb
01:57:48 pcb pcb
01:57:50 this is long enough
01:57:52 this is an actual pcb
01:57:54 theme song
01:57:56 it's not so incredible
01:57:58 I loved it though
01:58:00 dude
01:58:02 I have some thoughts
01:58:04 well it's great and it's funny
01:58:06 that was the best one by far
01:58:08 so far
01:58:10 I kinda think
01:58:12 we could shrink it
01:58:14 we could shrink it for our opening
01:58:16 it's always possible
01:58:18 I don't know if I'll love
01:58:20 the pcb
01:58:22 I don't know if that's gonna be fresh forever
01:58:24 I think that the problem is the song
01:58:26 does not have the best production quality
01:58:28 and it is really funny
01:58:30 as a joke song that we play on the
01:58:32 podcast
01:58:34 I don't know if it has staying
01:58:36 I meant just now
01:58:38 I'm already exhausted the full breadth of that
01:58:40 joke
01:58:42 I can't
01:58:44 give it an emphatic
01:58:46 I wanna hear that to intro every episode thumbs up
01:58:48 as I said in the last time we did the contest
01:58:50 I don't know if this
01:58:52 I'm not terribly into
01:58:54 the song where the lyrics are all a bunch of
01:58:56 references to the shit
01:58:58 I don't know
01:59:00 so do you want it to be pcb themed
01:59:02 or do you want it not
01:59:04 pcb themed
01:59:06 like generic or something
01:59:08 when I say, when we talk about having a theme
01:59:10 that fits the tone of the show
01:59:12 I don't mean one that makes references to the show
01:59:14 it doesn't have to do that
01:59:16 it's really funny having this conversation
01:59:18 because me and munchy just recently
01:59:20 constructed a perfect intro
01:59:22 for our
01:59:24 show
01:59:26 why don't we just do the same thing we did there
01:59:28 what show is that
01:59:30 the one for
01:59:32 stealing your dad's opening
01:59:34 it's like 20 seconds
01:59:36 a fun rap song with some goofy lyrics
01:59:38 that explain the point in brief
01:59:40 and like
01:59:42 it's basically the same thing as the isma one
01:59:44 to me that's like
01:59:46 if you were gonna do an intro it should just be
01:59:48 20 seconds and explains the
01:59:50 point of the podcast in a funny way
01:59:52 the intro for stealing your dad's
01:59:54 beautiful and it will be out in the next episode
01:59:56 that will be live so get hyped for that shit
01:59:58 everyone
02:00:00 that seems like reasonable advice
02:00:02 it should be like relatively short and punchy
02:00:04 short and punchy
02:00:06 and then it has a strong melody
02:00:08 and B about the PCP but also still
02:00:10 I literally get the list
02:00:12 this guy's got a heart though
02:00:14 I love how smile
02:00:16 you could tell he was smiling during the whole recording
02:00:18 like a big giant autism smile
02:00:20 you know what I mean
02:00:22 I do want to say
02:00:24 I will always
02:00:26 I will always be more likely to give the thumbs up
02:00:28 to a song that doesn't have lyrics
02:00:30 verse one that does just because
02:00:32 again podcast intro I do think
02:00:34 20 seconds is about right
02:00:36 alright this is
02:00:38 this is by mostly midi
02:00:40 this is a video on youtube and
02:00:42 he did the thing that we said not to and like
02:00:44 had like a video in the background
02:00:46 it just has a bunch of like images
02:00:48 I just want to say about the song
02:00:50 too late
02:00:52 really
02:00:54 you can see in your voice
02:00:56 okay
02:00:58 this is just literally
02:01:00 the final fantasy intro
02:01:02 it's similar
02:01:04 it's pretty chill
02:01:06 it's not as though
02:01:08 it's a little too chill
02:01:10 it does sound like he was made on
02:01:12 like chiptune
02:01:14 again
02:01:16 these people have put in hours to like
02:01:18 do this like futile song
02:01:20 now when they get on all we do is just shit on them
02:01:22 like oh no we don't want to do it
02:01:24 that was nice but again
02:01:26 it was generic
02:01:28 think of it this way none of these people
02:01:30 could have even spent more than like
02:01:32 a week or two on this right
02:01:34 like we only announced the contest so long
02:01:36 ago so it's not like we're burning down their
02:01:38 fucking masterpiece
02:01:40 alright they're entering a contest
02:01:42 and here they are facing the fucking fire
02:01:44 I release songs better than this every day
02:01:46 alright so I'm going to be a harsh on these people
02:01:48 if I could make the intro for the
02:01:50 show myself there's no reason we need
02:01:52 a contest
02:01:54 cause the reason we didn't like the outro song
02:01:56 for the intro was that it wasn't hype
02:01:58 it was just kind of like a silly
02:02:00 possible
02:02:02 but I'm sure that there's some people out there
02:02:04 who were working on a song anyway
02:02:06 who were just like I don't know let's fucking enter this
02:02:08 you know that's what the first one and this one
02:02:10 feel like
02:02:12 I can't prove it and maybe I'm wrong but it could
02:02:14 have been the case they just made a song
02:02:16 that's pretty good
02:02:18 I would say this intro is closer
02:02:20 than the ones I've heard so far but not in a good
02:02:22 way if that makes any sense
02:02:24 it at least
02:02:26 feels like sitting down to hear people talk
02:02:28 but we do want
02:02:30 one that's more energetic so I guess that is another thing
02:02:32 it's like we're sort of using these as the
02:02:34 initial wave of pawns to churn
02:02:36 through to then analyze like
02:02:38 here's what you did wrong
02:02:40 and as we analyze and destroy these
02:02:42 people's lives and dreams we're like understanding
02:02:44 slowly what we actually want
02:02:46 we're getting more and more specific each time
02:02:48 that's how you become like a content creator
02:02:50 you just make shit that sucks and then you just figure out
02:02:52 what you did wrong and then you fix it as you go so whatever
02:02:54 alright let's go to the next one what's the next one
02:02:56 this is by Alex C. Biel
02:02:58 oh
02:03:00 I know that guy
02:03:02 oh I don't want to do
02:03:04 anything
02:03:06 to
02:03:08 do
02:03:10 that's fucking called sleep in a good way
02:03:12 what pcp
02:03:14 episode
02:03:16 will I
02:03:18 have
02:03:20 replay
02:03:22 go
02:03:24 to the school
02:03:26 of college
02:03:28 cause it's
02:03:30 I
02:03:32 am
02:03:34 so
02:03:36 all the time in the world
02:03:38 to listen to
02:03:40 my favorite
02:03:42 pop
02:03:44 what a guy
02:03:46 we should play this in one of our
02:03:48 funerals
02:03:52 yeah my face
02:04:04 wow
02:04:06 that's it that's it
02:04:08 that's the one guy
02:04:10 yeah that wins
02:04:12 there should be a good like the rotation of ending
02:04:14 like you can always have the same one
02:04:16 if you want to like
02:04:18 have right now
02:04:20 yes
02:04:22 listen to the song
02:04:24 fuck off
02:04:26 a bit like good
02:04:30 this is okay this is like a good song
02:04:32 not a good show
02:04:34 shut up mate I'm trying to listen to the god damn song
02:04:36 alright keep passing the book
02:04:40 okay reference to the page
02:04:42 yeah
02:04:50 hey that was great
02:04:52 it's a terrible theme
02:04:54 it's terrible
02:04:56 that's like
02:04:58 that's like
02:05:00 it's not hype and it's also very long
02:05:02 that's like when you're watching the anime
02:05:04 when you're watching a season of an anime
02:05:06 and then like one of the episodes has like a really sad
02:05:08 like part of the narrative ending
02:05:10 the different ending theme song
02:05:12 for that episode
02:05:14 that's what that one is that's good
02:05:16 okay let's clarify real quick
02:05:18 do we want to be hype or just upbeat
02:05:20 I don't know
02:05:22 I just want it to sound like it would be
02:05:24 what you want to hear before a pcp podcast
02:05:26 I won't know it until I hear it
02:05:28 that's what's important
02:05:30 we could just have like a happy version
02:05:32 of the normal song
02:05:34 I think we could clearly say that that song
02:05:36 did not suit the tone
02:05:38 right
02:05:40 think about the way that we open our show
02:05:42 for any dickheads who think about how dick always opens
02:05:44 the show and how his theme plays
02:05:46 into that real well right that's good
02:05:48 so think about how we start our show
02:05:50 which is usually with Nate like busting and saying the shit
02:05:52 or munchy you know and then we introduce
02:05:54 each and every one of us
02:05:56 and like what's the right mood you want to be in
02:05:58 I mean traditionally with the intros
02:06:00 I would just have them fade whatever song
02:06:02 is playing underneath
02:06:04 yeah I mean that's the right thing to do
02:06:06 and I mean like I don't know like if we're struck
02:06:08 with like some great song
02:06:10 and we just like think that like oh if we just do
02:06:12 something slightly different as an opening
02:06:14 we can like work that like hey man
02:06:16 it's all I'm hoping to experiment and do all kinds
02:06:18 of crazy shit here
02:06:20 next one is
02:06:22 by
02:06:24 Groundless Slash
02:06:26 Garbage Burner
02:06:28 this is PCP punk rock anarchy
02:06:36 okay okay
02:06:38 I like this part
02:06:40 good song
02:06:42 look at that song
02:06:44 wow
02:06:46 reference
02:06:48 this
02:06:50 this is like an AMV song
02:06:52 cause these people screaming over it
02:06:54 yeah
02:06:56 oh I do I do
02:06:58 IT'S AMV
02:07:00 this episode
02:07:02 that's what it is
02:07:04 PROCESSED
02:07:06 oh it's soft already I was gonna sing it
02:07:08 I really liked it so much
02:07:10 not for the PCP necessarily
02:07:12 but I like it a lot
02:07:14 I can't
02:07:16 I find it hard
02:07:18 okay I think tonally it was about right
02:07:20 but I find I can't I don't know if I can sign off
02:07:22 on a theme song that is like
02:07:24 that could be the opening to
02:07:26 any podcast
02:07:28 I generally agree
02:07:30 since we're doing a contest I'm shooting for the stars
02:07:32 you know
02:07:34 and that's it
02:07:36 wait wasn't there
02:07:38 we already played it last episode
02:07:40 oh we did
02:07:42 I'll have to listen later
02:07:44 I didn't even know this contest was happening
02:07:46 until I came into this episode
02:07:48 and that's why you know
02:07:50 that's why we voted you out of the PCP
02:07:52 digi
02:07:54 we were waiting to tell you
02:07:56 well that was good alright just take that feedback
02:07:58 listen to that whole section and for what you can from it
02:08:00 I wanted everybody
02:08:02 I mean should we have people in the comments
02:08:04 like comment on like
02:08:06 what you think about the submissions
02:08:08 feel free but I don't care what they think
02:08:10 yeah okay alright
02:08:12 that's fair
02:08:14 none of us know what we want
02:08:16 and some of us don't even want to
02:08:18 I know exactly what I want
02:08:20 I want no theme song
02:08:22 I want individual intros on every episode
02:08:24 well we can't very well do that
02:08:26 but after we've done this contest
02:08:28 at first and I was voted down
02:08:30 so frankly shut the fuck up
02:08:32 and get on board with the program
02:08:34 because that's what's happening now
02:08:36 we don't even want to do it anymore
02:08:38 I'm in this now
02:08:40 we're contractually obligated to carry this contest
02:08:42 I'm interested I'm invested now
02:08:44 I like this and I want to keep doing it
02:08:46 I mean I think it's
02:08:48 getting all these submissions is great
02:08:50 there you go
02:08:52 there you go
02:08:54 there you go
02:08:56 our criteria are all massively contradictory
02:08:58 we should just let the fans vote
02:09:00 that's the worst thing I ever wanted
02:09:02 no absolutely not
02:09:04 we should just let the fans vote
02:09:06 I am at least curious of their input
02:09:08 like they're
02:09:10 oh yeah I want to hear their input
02:09:12 I want them to vote on whether or not
02:09:14 they think we should have a theme song
02:09:16 whether or not they think
02:09:18 because personally
02:09:20 when we started putting the opening
02:09:22 on the show
02:09:24 I didn't know at first because I wasn't listening back to the shows
02:09:26 I had missed a bunch of episodes
02:09:28 but May listens to all of them
02:09:30 and she was like yeah I skip it every time
02:09:32 it's a huge pain in the ass
02:09:34 so I was like well obviously everyone's doing that
02:09:36 because nobody wants to hear this song for the thousandth time
02:09:38 for 30 whole seconds at the start of the episode
02:09:40 so like unless it's
02:09:42 insanely short
02:09:44 that happened like one time
02:09:46 that happened one time
02:09:48 it was the one time I saw it
02:09:50 and I was like this is horrifying
02:09:52 it was too long one time
02:09:54 Jesus
02:09:56 this is what's happening it's over
02:09:58 we're doing a PCB theme
02:10:00 there's no debate now we're in it
02:10:02 there's no challenging this
02:10:04 this is great
02:10:06 get excited
02:10:08 this is trumps America
02:10:10 this is trumps America
02:10:12 it's sad to have to debate this because I like
02:10:14 I really like these songs
02:10:16 I really like that they're being made
02:10:18 so I like the contest for that reason
02:10:20 but now it's so fraught
02:10:22 it's so fraught
02:10:24 okay so the thing is we keep saying all these criteria
02:10:26 but speaking only for myself
02:10:28 if you just make a great song
02:10:30 it makes me hype just because it's great
02:10:32 you might be able to give a thumbs up for me
02:10:34 just being like you know what
02:10:36 maybe this doesn't fit my preconceived notions
02:10:38 of what the shows tone should be
02:10:40 but the song is great
02:10:42 on it's own
02:10:44 you gotta get the Beyblade
02:10:46 animated TV
02:10:48 you gotta change the thing that they say
02:10:50 at the end they say let's Beyblade
02:10:52 you gotta change that to PCP
02:10:54 and that's what you gotta do
02:10:56 that's what I'll get my vote in the general election
02:10:58 vote for that
02:11:00 I wanted to be
02:11:02 acapella
02:11:04 of Ocarina of Time songs
02:11:06 that's the PCP intro
02:11:08 alright
02:11:10 let's go home
02:11:12 alright let's go to questions
02:11:14 oh god no
02:11:16 let it end
02:11:18 let the show be over
02:11:20 no we have to
02:11:22 what are all these weird
02:11:24 why are we obligating ourselves to random things
02:11:26 we've said we're going to do all the time
02:11:28 can we not make decisions that
02:11:30 change and evolve based on the situation
02:11:32 that is obviously in front of us
02:11:34 when things are bad don't let them keep being bad
02:11:36 we told people
02:11:38 that we were going to read questions
02:11:40 and people have asked questions
02:11:42 do they even really care
02:11:44 look look we can bust through the questions
02:11:46 in like three minutes
02:11:48 this is a simple
02:11:50 issue
02:11:52 when the episode goes long we do less questions
02:11:54 so let's just do less questions
02:11:56 here it is
02:11:58 here's the pity question
02:12:00 here it is
02:12:02 this is a question that is answered
02:12:04 by another question in this thing
02:12:06 this is from at biscuit meep
02:12:08 are there any episodes of the PCP
02:12:10 that you wish were never made
02:12:12 from iclone that says
02:12:14 can you do another show similar to the monster episode
02:12:16 it was everyone's favorite
02:12:18 there's the joke everybody
02:12:20 monsters 2 literally went
02:12:22 that's what I want
02:12:24 immediately great question
02:12:26 there it is that's the pity questions done
02:12:28 onto the bonus lounge
02:12:30 what do they got
02:12:32 someone just says driving is gay
02:12:34 no question mark
02:12:36 alright let's talk about that
02:12:38 that is not the question
02:12:40 I mean
02:12:42 is there anything that you did in your childhood
02:12:44 that really makes you cringe now
02:12:46 a cringe scene is stupid
02:12:48 and childhoods are great
02:12:50 and if you did something stupid as a kid
02:12:52 it's not like oh my god I'm fucking so stupid
02:12:54 it's just like wow you did something wrong
02:12:56 well everyone's done something wrong
02:12:58 I remember Jimmy Newtide
02:13:00 he said one cares not to acknowledge the mistakes of one's youth
02:13:02 Johnny
02:13:04 Neutron also said God of Blast
02:13:06 do we listen to him do we blast
02:13:08 do we have a holocaust every day of our life
02:13:10 do we do G-Hodges because Johnny Neutron wants us to
02:13:12 no we live our own lives
02:13:14 we're autonomous we're not
02:13:16 ISIS bombers like you
02:13:18 and Johnny Neutron
02:13:20 feeling the emotion of cringe
02:13:22 and thinking that it's a bad thing
02:13:24 that's the first mistake
02:13:26 that's the first clue that you're not mature
02:13:28 that's what they mean
02:13:30 cringe is bad and it's not true
02:13:32 yeah
02:13:34 cringe goes to like chibi bakas
02:13:36 literally we are
02:13:38 bringing chibi back
02:13:40 mean hippo are in the process of
02:13:42 reviving chibi
02:13:44 this is the point of chibi bakas
02:13:46 okay next question
02:13:48 drawing like yaoi is not cool
02:13:50 you should be proud of what you've done
02:13:52 actually I haven't answered that question
02:13:54 next question
02:13:56 next question
02:13:58 how much rape bro
02:14:00 question mark
02:14:02 how much rape bro
02:14:04 next question
02:14:06 next question
02:14:08 all of these are just
02:14:10 terrible
02:14:12 the problem with this is that
02:14:14 when you tell people the topic
02:14:16 sometimes they're all like the same question and suck
02:14:18 what was your favorite anime as a child
02:14:20 there you go
02:14:22 that's the same question but the child
02:14:24 exactly that's what I'm saying
02:14:26 excellent
02:14:28 wait was that a real question
02:14:30 that was a real question
02:14:32 wait who asked that
02:14:34 someone says what were your dreams and ambitions
02:14:36 do you have anything
02:14:38 it was R U guy
02:14:40 when you were kid what was your favorite anime
02:14:42 my dream and ambition as a kid
02:14:44 was to make a fucking
02:14:46 manga
02:14:48 because I liked dragon ball
02:14:50 I had one volume of dragon ball
02:14:52 just dragon ball
02:14:54 in the library and I would read it and reread it over and over again
02:14:56 I'd be like I want to do this
02:14:58 right
02:15:00 I'm a veterinarian as I already said in the episode
02:15:02 my dream as a little kid
02:15:04 was to trick a digi bro into talking to me
02:15:06 dude same
02:15:08 what a mistake
02:15:10 when I was young I wanted to be really ripped
02:15:12 that was my as a result of watching
02:15:14 dragon ball z and later one piece
02:15:16 I just wanted to be an anime character
02:15:18 didn't really care which one
02:15:20 my dream was just to be some sort of artist
02:15:22 professionally so yeah
02:15:24 my dream was to be 2 million dollars
02:15:26 and it's still my dream right now
02:15:28 we have fan art too
02:15:30 we have a fan art section
02:15:32 god no
02:15:34 the fan art it'll just be on screen
02:15:36 here's all of it right now
02:15:38 here's all of the fan art on the screen right now
02:15:40 time for the time for the fan art which we were supposed to do before
02:15:42 question but who gives a shit
02:15:44 look at this first one
02:15:46 hey thanks parron unit 01
02:15:48 the cool drawing of me
02:15:50 Adam desu
02:15:52 wait no no this one's good
02:15:54 I feel like
02:15:56 the spite
02:15:58 that we're like spitting right now
02:16:00 at just like people's like hard work
02:16:02 trying to make us feel like
02:16:04 it's not even funny
02:16:06 it's not even funny
02:16:08 people that worked really hard
02:16:10 to express their sincere admiration of us
02:16:12 fuck you
02:16:14 yo this one in Nate was good
02:16:16 except my eyes are bright
02:16:18 the one that was pointing at the city with his fucking
02:16:20 all of his hair bulging out and everything
02:16:22 let's get to that
02:16:24 back start for this is Ethan
02:16:26 said in chat
02:16:28 actually
02:16:30 complex backstory here
02:16:32 usually for every questions
02:16:34 we announce we're doing questions and then at the end
02:16:36 Nate will say oh we're done
02:16:38 we're done doing questions now
02:16:40 but last time he didn't say
02:16:42 we're done doing questions and so for the past week
02:16:44 I've been occasionally going to chat and saying guys
02:16:46 we're still going we need more questions
02:16:48 so we've been doing that for like the past week
02:16:50 and then eventually I was in a call with Ethan
02:16:52 and he said like he asked a question
02:16:54 and he said hey Munchie how do I throw my best for that at him knowing
02:16:56 and then I said this
02:16:58 by stuffing a bar of soap in your mouth
02:17:00 and walking your football field away
02:17:02 also I'll be kicking you double that son
02:17:04 and then someone will be better
02:17:06 wait wait wait going back
02:17:08 going back to the urban dictionary one
02:17:10 look at the way that it's shaded
02:17:12 look at the way that shadows are
02:17:14 it's baffling
02:17:16 like the shading technique employed here is baffling
02:17:18 I don't think this person is an expert
02:17:20 well it's weird because like he did it right
02:17:22 in certain places but then he like
02:17:24 like look at the folds on your robe like that makes sense
02:17:26 like down at the bottom
02:17:28 but then over it there's just these big thick
02:17:30 fucking bars
02:17:32 those are anime blush lines
02:17:34 yeah we were all grilled
02:17:36 yeah we were all grilled
02:17:38 I think the point of that is that the light is at his back
02:17:40 so he was trying to make it like he was darker in the front
02:17:42 oh no I get what he was going for
02:17:44 he just put his technique as bizarre
02:17:46 is all I'm saying
02:17:48 there's a face on the bottom left there
02:17:50 who cares about this fan art of a lot of us
02:17:52 how about this fan art of only me
02:17:54 how about that
02:17:56 Lane Slimes
02:17:58 that one down there
02:18:00 I like that me and Nate are directly
02:18:02 in front of each other
02:18:04 like we're Nemesis
02:18:06 that's true
02:18:08 I'm the only one not making a comment
02:18:10 I'm just giving a death stare
02:18:12 it's the angel and the demon
02:18:14 you know Nate and Mage
02:18:16 I have a huge dick in this
02:18:18 a huge dick
02:18:20 lots of cubes
02:18:22 what was the BD for though
02:18:24 I have no clue
02:18:26 I'm assuming big dick
02:18:28 I assumed big dick as well
02:18:30 this was like in the chat
02:18:32 because I saw where this was
02:18:34 it was for a specific reason that BD was there
02:18:36 but I can't fucking remember
02:18:38 back to daddy
02:18:40 then we have another one just of me
02:18:42 because I'm just like a photogenic person
02:18:44 this is my lines line
02:18:46 this is me eating my ice cream soup
02:18:48 ice cream soup
02:18:50 I love ice cream soup
02:18:52 that's my favorite soup
02:18:54 you fucking animals
02:18:56 except that I'm on keto now
02:18:58 wow
02:19:00 what the actual fuck
02:19:02 why
02:19:04 here's my chip
02:19:06 it's just like a digi
02:19:08 my ice cream soup is different from
02:19:10 munchies ice cream soup
02:19:12 probably just
02:19:14 Mage what is your ice cream soup
02:19:16 it's just literally melted ice cream
02:19:18 I like melting ice cream
02:19:20 unpopular opinion
02:19:22 I really like the expression on this drawing
02:19:24 by the way
02:19:26 it's cute
02:19:28 let me make a radical proposal
02:19:30 let me make a modest proposal
02:19:32 if I may
02:19:34 maybe
02:19:36 art of one of us doesn't count
02:19:38 I know what you mean
02:19:40 art of you a lot
02:19:42 and you like it a lot and you want to talk about it
02:19:44 what
02:19:46 I hear what you're saying
02:19:48 and there's definitely some logic to that
02:19:50 like this is not like this is
02:19:52 this first one is Nate fan art
02:19:54 and this second to last one is Munchie fan art
02:19:56 this is not PCP fan art
02:19:58 and same with digi
02:20:00 maybe we just need to use the smell test
02:20:02 if it seems PCP related or not
02:20:04 I mean
02:20:06 I haven't been given the chance
02:20:08 to use the smell test most of these
02:20:10 would not have
02:20:12 let me say
02:20:14 the Munchies one
02:20:16 aren't they related to what he said
02:20:18 related to the PCP
02:20:20 they're not just Munchie
02:20:22 like the digi one
02:20:24 I would argue I guess it's just
02:20:26 digi fan art but the rest is
02:20:28 PCP related
02:20:30 okay alright
02:20:32 we should smell test these before
02:20:34 alright here we go
02:20:36 Karabelle I have not seen this
02:20:38 can we play a game until it just hit play at the same time
02:20:40 oh god okay yeah
02:20:42 but you have to click and pause so it would load for you
02:20:44 I will click and pause
02:20:46 alright I'll do that

02:22:04 I wasn't sure why he chose
02:22:06 of all segments to choose one like that
02:22:08 the intro seemed to be popular
02:22:10 I don't know
02:22:12 I think he picked him, wait wait
