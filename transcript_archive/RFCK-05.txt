00:00:00 Alright, let's turn on the game.
00:00:02 We're free.
00:00:04 Let's just play all the video games, whatever it may be.
00:00:07 Alright, I'm gonna start with Pokemon.
00:00:11 And now!
00:00:14 Alright, I'm gonna do Mabeebley's quest.
00:00:16 Okay, Mabeebley's.
00:00:21 What's this?
00:00:22 Mabeebley.
00:00:23 Should we introduce the video?
00:00:25 Yeah, hey, it's RowdyFuckersCopKillersLIVE!
00:00:28 Live in Ben's room.
00:00:31 Welcome to the indie game clusterfuck.
00:00:33 The game where we fuck all indie games ever made.
00:00:36 Yeah, fuck indie games.
00:00:38 I don't like them.
00:00:39 Nobody really likes them.
00:00:41 We all just pretend to, so we think each other is cool.
00:00:44 If they were good, they'd make a billion dollars.
00:00:48 Look, my favorite AAA game, Undertale.
00:00:53 So, we'll probably switch games at some point,
00:00:56 but I, BenSaintofPatrion.com, slash BenSaint,
00:01:00 am playing Mabeebley's quest,
00:01:03 which is like a Mega Man clone, basically,
00:01:06 by a gay furry on Twitter.
00:01:08 And it's really hard, but it's really good and pretty cool.
00:01:11 Do we get to do the Mabeebley?
00:01:14 You are Mabeebley.
00:01:15 Okay.
00:01:16 Let's do a new game.
00:01:17 I'll start a new game.
00:01:20 I have not actually beaten this game.
00:01:22 I've gotten, like, halfway, and then it got too hard,
00:01:24 and I gave up.
00:01:25 You're harsh.
00:01:26 Well, I'm not going to set up that kind of pushy attitude anymore.
00:01:29 Mabeebley difficulty.
00:01:30 Mabeebley easy or double easy?
00:01:31 Be a true hero.
00:01:32 Easy or double easy.
00:01:34 No, no.
00:01:35 It sounds like it wants you to play Mabeebley.
00:01:37 No, no easy.
00:01:38 Mabeebley.
00:01:39 Dude, Mabeebley.
00:01:40 No.
00:01:41 Would you get stuck on easy?
00:01:43 I think I was playing Mabeebley.
00:01:45 You played Mabeebley, you fucking bitch.
00:01:47 Fine.
00:01:48 You already got halfway through.
00:01:49 God.
00:01:50 Easy.
00:01:51 Ooh, I like it.
00:01:52 Oh, yeah.
00:01:53 Your bullets are weird and, like, drop off halfway through.
00:01:57 What I like about this game is that it has the background,
00:01:59 and it's like...
00:02:01 Oh my god.
00:02:02 Dude.
00:02:03 Whoa.
00:02:04 Very artistic.
00:02:05 You got a fucking dick, you got a dick, suck a dick, suck a dick.
00:02:07 Go, go, go, go, suck the dick, suck the dick, suck the dick.
00:02:10 You guys are pressuring me too much.
00:02:12 I'm feeling performance anxiety.
00:02:15 I'm already impressed by the prevalence of tics in this game.
00:02:19 It's really appealing to my demographic.
00:02:21 Which...
00:02:22 Of most sexual...
00:02:23 The gayden.
00:02:24 Somebody's got to appeal to them.
00:02:28 Whoa, okay.
00:02:29 That's cool.
00:02:30 There's a lot of, like, weird creative shit you've never seen before.
00:02:34 Yeah, you're like rolling out the video game.
00:02:36 It's like game's art.
00:02:38 Video game's art.
00:02:39 Never heard that.
00:02:42 Kill the art.
00:02:44 Look at all this art.
00:02:45 I want to kill that pencil.
00:02:48 There we go.
00:02:49 You shoot through walls.
00:02:51 Yeah, your bullets just kind of...
00:02:53 They don't go a set distance.
00:02:54 They go to sort of the end of the screen,
00:02:57 and then just sort of drew balls.
00:02:59 It seems like, like, programatically it was programmed to just kind of go...
00:03:04 So wait.
00:03:05 If they're programmed to go to the end of the screen,
00:03:07 does that mean if you run with them, they will never stop?
00:03:10 Yes.
00:03:11 Well, to an extent.
00:03:12 It sounds like they sort of detect the edge of the currently visible screen.
00:03:16 Oh, shit.
00:03:17 Oh, you're so fucking gay.
00:03:19 Oh, he got me.
00:03:20 What the hell happened?
00:03:21 He fucking turned me into a...
00:03:22 He hit me with his spotlight and turned me into a piece of art.
00:03:25 I like it.
00:03:26 Such art in this game.
00:03:28 Such art, dog.
00:03:29 This is pretty cool, though.
00:03:30 Art in the truest sense.
00:03:32 It's a metaphor for art.
00:03:34 Yeah, like, I really meant to finish the game,
00:03:37 because, like, there's actually some really great cutscenes and shit that happen
00:03:41 and maybe we'll get to see one or two of them.
00:03:43 And they...
00:03:44 Yeah, you see, you are Mbibli, a creature of indeterminate anything,
00:03:48 and your enemy is Croco-Bibli.
00:03:51 At least we know he's a crocodile.
00:03:55 Do we know that?
00:03:56 Dude, you saw the pipe as well.
00:03:58 Fucking art.
00:03:59 That's how you really know it's art.
00:04:01 Also, the fact that this is called art world.
00:04:03 Max lives.
00:04:04 We did it.
00:04:05 I didn't even need those lives.
00:04:06 This game's the easiest thing in the world.
00:04:07 Is three of the max lives?
00:04:08 Oh, yes.
00:04:09 Don't worry, it gets a lot harder.
00:04:12 Oh, gosh.
00:04:13 Oh, shit.
00:04:14 You're so bad.
00:04:15 No, let's see, I dodged that one.
00:04:17 Oh, gosh.
00:04:18 Oh, no!
00:04:20 Oh, no.
00:04:21 You're blowing it.
00:04:23 That was a devious trap game.
00:04:26 Hey, this is great.
00:04:27 So, how have you guys been doing?
00:04:28 This game reminds me of that one time I went to Las Vegas with no money,
00:04:32 and I just killed people.
00:04:34 So, this is being recorded at Radcon 2.
00:04:37 Yeah.
00:04:38 How are you guys enjoying Radcon 2 so far?
00:04:40 It's okay.
00:04:41 I'd rather be killing people in Las Vegas.
00:04:44 As previously mentioned, it's good.
00:04:47 It's a good time.
00:04:48 Yeah, I would download it.
00:04:51 I would download the DLC.
00:04:53 Yeah.
00:04:54 Well, that is real.
00:04:55 Radcon 2.5 DLC.
00:04:57 We were having snow adventures out in the wilderness today, which was fun.
00:05:02 There's footage of that that will exist.
00:05:04 Oh, no.
00:05:05 Did I miss the main event?
00:05:06 You did.
00:05:07 A snow event?
00:05:08 Yeah, you did.
00:05:09 This is what I fucking get.
00:05:11 I did try to wake you on two occasions, so you were just a check-down.
00:05:14 I can believe that.
00:05:16 I am an indecipherable piece of crappy art, just like me.
00:05:19 What a commentary.
00:05:21 So...
00:05:23 Oh, there he is.
00:05:24 Arch enemy.
00:05:25 Crocodiebly.
00:05:26 Crocodiebly.
00:05:27 I was...
00:05:28 Crocodiable.
00:05:29 Kill him.
00:05:30 He's a fucking Bible character.
00:05:31 He's a fucking Bible character.
00:05:33 See, it helpfully notes that he is Arch enemy.
00:05:36 I do like that.
00:05:37 Oh, God.
00:05:38 Okay.
00:05:39 He has not accomplished much, if anything.
00:05:41 Uh-oh.
00:05:42 Okay, all right.
00:05:45 Crocodiebly.
00:05:46 Just chill a fuck out, dude.
00:05:48 He's such an asshole, dude.
00:05:49 Look at him.
00:05:50 Who would do this?
00:05:51 This is really beyond the pale of acceptable behavior.
00:05:55 God.
00:05:56 If there's one thing I hate, it's pretentious people.
00:05:59 Look at his hair.
00:06:00 Look at him.
00:06:01 Dude, look at his fucking...
00:06:02 Whoa.
00:06:03 Look at his comeover, bro.
00:06:04 You can tell he's bald.
00:06:05 Oh, God.
00:06:06 He's really embarrassed.
00:06:07 What is that?
00:06:08 Wow, look at his fucking...
00:06:09 Wow, real originally, you took some organs out of someone's body that you didn't make.
00:06:14 Wow.
00:06:15 Yeah, God made those.
00:06:16 Yeah, you fucking bitch.
00:06:17 Oh, God.
00:06:18 Okay, all right.
00:06:19 Oh, my fucking God.
00:06:20 I'm in like...
00:06:21 Yeah, I can only move left and right.
00:06:24 That up and down is automatic, but the left and right is up to me.
00:06:27 That's what's happening right now, viewer and friends.
00:06:31 Okay.
00:06:32 All right.
00:06:33 So, as you can see, this is the best game I've ever made.
00:06:35 All right.
00:06:36 Yeah.
00:06:37 This is not fucking around.
00:06:38 I just killed his Croco Man already.
00:06:39 I mean, I would.
00:06:40 All right.
00:06:41 I would if you would let me.
00:06:43 God.
00:06:44 I'm not stopping.
00:06:45 Oh, okay.
00:06:46 You're actually doing quite well, Tim.
00:06:49 Oh, man.
00:06:50 Oh, man.
00:06:51 He's spraying piss everywhere.
00:06:53 He's shooting at the ball.
00:06:54 This guy reminds me of my...
00:06:56 He's shooting at the ball.
00:06:58 This guy reminds me of my teacher in middle school.
00:07:00 Was he a crocodile?
00:07:01 I killed him.
00:07:02 Okay.
00:07:03 HP bar is doing things now.
00:07:04 Son of a fucking bitch.
00:07:05 All right.
00:07:06 All right.
00:07:07 You know, one time, me and my friends, I was in a gaming club in college and we did a couple
00:07:12 of game jams because I had a lot of game design stuff at the time.
00:07:15 And one of the things that happened was one of the game jams was about like breaking conventions
00:07:20 or something.
00:07:21 Whoa, how unconventional.
00:07:22 And there was a whole bunch of stuff.
00:07:23 I know.
00:07:24 We did it in the game that was made for a bunch of things like this where one of the things
00:07:27 that happened was that if you get too much HP because there are HP pickups, it was a normal
00:07:31 2D platformer.
00:07:32 And if you pick up too much HP health, your health bar extends too far, breaks the barrier
00:07:38 surrounding it and it just drops off the screen and then you're invisible.
00:07:41 Whoa.
00:07:42 It's pretty cool.
00:07:43 Yeah.
00:07:44 It's pretty creative stuff.
00:07:45 Okay.
00:07:46 Enough with the intestines.
00:07:47 No.
00:07:48 Oh.
00:07:49 An immeasurably long time.
00:07:51 Eventually they got born in parted ways.
00:07:53 Well, I guess I won't.
00:07:55 All right.
00:07:56 All right.
00:07:57 Yeah.
00:07:58 I'll call that a victory.
00:07:59 That's the moral victory of nothing else.
00:08:00 What?
00:08:01 Oh.
00:08:02 Well, this game sure is quirky and fun.
00:08:04 We're going to see another game I like to call...
00:08:06 Undertale.
00:08:07 Undertale.
00:08:08 No.
00:08:09 No.
00:08:10 You watch there are good games that aren't Undertale.
00:08:12 No.
00:08:13 No.
00:08:14 They're Undertale.
00:08:15 They are all Undertale.
00:08:16 Every time you see a good game, this really reminds me of Undertale for some reason.
00:08:19 This is a really good Undertale you're playing right now.
00:08:23 God, that makes me so mad.
00:08:26 You know, Lisa's a pretty good Undertale, but you know, it just doesn't...
00:08:29 It doesn't really...
00:08:30 It doesn't quite live up to...
00:08:31 I mean, there aren't any fucking memes.
00:08:33 The Undertale is...
00:08:34 There aren't any fucking Skeletons.
00:08:37 You're sad.
00:08:39 Sad.
00:08:40 My dick is soft.
00:08:41 You need to suck it to make it hard.
00:08:44 Sad.
00:08:45 Sad.
00:08:46 Why are you not in this game as well?
00:08:48 You would be a good addition.
00:08:50 What are these people saying?
00:08:51 They're all just saying really sad things.
00:08:53 Damn, you're ugly.
00:08:55 Hey, fuck off, buddy.
00:08:56 I think the person who made this game has low self-esteem.
00:08:58 It's the Mibible.
00:08:59 The Mibible.
00:09:00 That was the Mibible that I almost reached, but I was teleported.
00:09:04 What's the significance of the Mibible?
00:09:06 Oh, you'll see, but you'll see what the Mibible is.
00:09:08 Okay, what's that going on?
00:09:09 You are hero.
00:09:10 Okay, okay.
00:09:11 You are hero.
00:09:12 You are hero, Gordon Freeman.
00:09:16 Okay, we're teleporting.
00:09:18 All right.
00:09:19 I teleported in front of my own bullets.
00:09:21 Okay.
00:09:22 You ever want to do that in the battlefield?
00:09:24 No.
00:09:25 No, it's...
00:09:26 It's reckless behavior.
00:09:27 God, Battlefield 3 looks so fucking bad.
00:09:30 Battlefield 3 is my favorite Undertale.
00:09:33 Why is this game such a fucking Pokemon ripoff?
00:09:38 Pokemon is a really good Undertale.
00:09:40 Yeah, that's true.
00:09:42 Sun and Moon had a lot of good Undertale traits.
00:09:46 Oh, you're going to die, dude.
00:09:47 You're going to fall.
00:09:48 Am I going to die?
00:09:49 You're going to fall.
00:09:50 Maybe.
00:09:51 Oh, there we go.
00:09:52 Okay.
00:09:53 But it was a quirky like...
00:09:54 Oh, the force.
00:09:55 Any second now.
00:09:56 Okay, here we go.
00:09:57 Yeah, we did it.
00:09:59 By the way, I started Audacity in OBS, right?
00:10:03 Yes.
00:10:04 I'm almost positive, but I always doubt this.
00:10:06 I really don't know.
00:10:07 Just check.
00:10:08 No, not on this dramatic screen.
00:10:10 Oh, I get it.
00:10:11 They're doing this to kill time while you're stuck in there.
00:10:13 That's funny.
00:10:14 I like it.
00:10:15 That's quirk.
00:10:16 It's pretty good Undertale.
00:10:17 Yeah, it reminds me of that one time on Undertale where they were like,
00:10:19 do you know that we're like a video game?
00:10:21 And you're like playing a video game right now.
00:10:23 I just want to let you know when people forget it.
00:10:26 Yeah, Undertale had a lot of good Undertale qualities.
00:10:29 It was all like, dude, like video games and RPGs, bro.
00:10:34 Yeah, it was basically Control-Alt-Delete, the video game.
00:10:37 Yeah.
00:10:38 It was just all about video games.
00:10:39 Yes.
00:10:40 Is that elephant a good boy?
00:10:42 I'd say...
00:10:43 That's the fucking elephant from Dumbo.
00:10:45 Holy shit, he's fucking here.
00:10:47 Heroine Dumbo drank that shit and he was like,
00:10:49 oh my god.
00:10:51 Oh, wait, what did I do?
00:10:52 Oops, I didn't mean to do that.
00:10:54 Just check your audio while you're...
00:10:56 This is recording.
00:10:57 This is recording.
00:10:58 Okay, we're good.
00:10:59 We're good.
00:11:00 Just kidding.
00:11:01 Just kidding.
00:11:02 Game over.
00:11:03 Game over, fools.
00:11:05 Hurry up and get to that rave, dawg.
00:11:07 Hang on, hang on.
00:11:08 That's where the rave is.
00:11:09 The rave is the city.
00:11:10 Wait, was there a bar at the top and bottom before there was?
00:11:14 There was not.
00:11:15 Here, just try double-clicking the screen.
00:11:18 Or there might be an option on the top left
00:11:20 that specifically is like a maximized function of the game
00:11:23 as opposed to the window.
00:11:25 No.
00:11:26 No, you fucking died.
00:11:28 Wait, there might be...
00:11:29 Try like one of the...
00:11:30 First, F4.
00:11:31 Unminimize and try F4 or whatever.
00:11:33 Yeah.
00:11:34 Try some of the other Fs.
00:11:36 F.
00:11:37 F1.
00:11:38 U.
00:11:39 Yeah, choose FU.
00:11:41 Yes, I'm very sick.
00:11:45 I don't know how to do it before.
00:11:47 It makes me want to cry.
00:11:49 Oh, really?
00:11:51 Whatever, just maximize it's fine.
00:11:52 No, no, no.
00:11:53 I really want to...
00:11:55 See, there's got to be a menu because I want to find how to save.
00:11:58 Try right-clicking on the screen, maybe?
00:12:00 No.
00:12:01 That's wrong.
00:12:02 That's wrong.
00:12:03 Hit enter, maybe?
00:12:04 And go escape, perhaps?
00:12:06 Escape is how we got into this mess.
00:12:08 On its own, press escape again.
00:12:11 Nope.
00:12:12 Doesn't seem to be doing it.
00:12:13 First, all the buttons on your keyboard.
00:12:15 Let me just tell you, this would never happen in Undertale.
00:12:17 Yeah, Undertale has a very concise method of doing anything.
00:12:21 Undertale is always the same thing.
00:12:23 Perfectly ergonomic.
00:12:24 Even when it's trying to do the deal.
00:12:27 Undertale, I really like Undertale.
00:12:29 I respect it forever.
00:12:30 I respect Undertale for continuing to present conventions
00:12:34 and not breaking them whatsoever.
00:12:36 Because I likely used to say the same.
00:12:38 Although, I mean, what if I die?
00:12:39 I haven't saved.
00:12:41 Is that a problem?
00:12:43 Well, maybe.
00:12:45 I see how I skip...
00:12:47 I buffed conventions and passed the levels.
00:12:53 What about the rave?
00:12:55 I don't know.
00:12:56 What about the rave?
00:12:57 I just really wanted to go that way.
00:12:58 That's me.
00:12:59 Sometimes a boy just wants to dance.
00:13:01 Looks like I need three more hammers to, I guess, kill these horses.
00:13:05 Hey, it's Tommy.
00:13:06 You're a ready-fuck-your-cop killer now.
00:13:08 You are officially a ready-fuck-your-cop killer.
00:13:11 Well, it's this.
00:13:13 You will soon.
00:13:14 We're sitting here and playing shitty indie games
00:13:16 that we all love.
00:13:17 Buy yourself a place.
00:13:18 Well, who's gonna be an indie clusterfuck?
00:13:20 We hate all video games ever made
00:13:23 unless they were made by Toby J. Fox.
00:13:27 Is the middle initials J?
00:13:29 No.
00:13:30 No, he doesn't have a name.
00:13:32 He doesn't have a real name.
00:13:33 I was gonna say, the same for Jim.
00:13:36 All that money he took.
00:13:38 Yeah, all that money he stole from me.
00:13:40 Man, go to the rave.
00:13:41 All right, fine.
00:13:42 What the fuck is this shit?
00:13:44 Grind up against a fucking fag, bro.
00:13:47 This isn't a beat.
00:13:48 You know, this game is not as hard as I remember.
00:13:50 No, that's good.
00:13:51 But it does get...
00:13:52 Oh, this is the best fucking level.
00:13:54 Okay.
00:13:55 So the thing about these games, or this level,
00:13:58 is it's DVR inspired, and if you hit one of these arrows,
00:14:01 you don't get hurt, but you do freeze in place
00:14:04 and are shot at, and you can only move
00:14:07 when you hit the corresponding direction or button.
00:14:12 Cool.
00:14:13 It's so fucking great.
00:14:16 Okay, fuck that up.
00:14:18 And I'm about to die.
00:14:19 Okay.
00:14:20 Well, I died.
00:14:21 Okay, don't worry about it.
00:14:22 Never mind.
00:14:23 This is the hardest game I've ever made.
00:14:25 All right.
00:14:26 Does it remind you of that one time in Archeo
00:14:28 where, like, you were at a magical place
00:14:29 and it was like, dude, you have to fucking do it?
00:14:31 I remember that.
00:14:32 It was the best thing that ever happened to me in my life.
00:14:35 Oh, sad!
00:14:38 Oh, sad!
00:14:40 I feel like I'm a pretty pretty boy.
00:14:44 Mmm, I don't.
00:14:48 Who's that?
00:14:49 Indie games are all...
00:14:51 Indie games are for nerds.
00:14:53 Papyrus.
00:14:54 That's my sense.
00:14:56 Indie games, more like Indie games.
00:15:00 It's time for a woman, Papyrus.
00:15:04 I can't wait to vote for Donald Trump.
00:15:10 No!
00:15:11 Audience, I said this yesterday.
00:15:12 It was literally the funniest thing that ever happened.
00:15:14 Just trust me on that.
00:15:16 I'm still with her, man.
00:15:18 I'm still with her.
00:15:19 I'm still with her, Papyrus.
00:15:21 I'm still with her, Papyrus.
00:15:22 I'm always going to be with her.
00:15:23 It's her time.
00:15:24 I'm not my president.
00:15:26 I don't know.
00:15:27 You seem to have a few votes to pick from these polls.
00:15:29 Oh, no!
00:15:31 No!
00:15:32 Because he's a skeleton!
00:15:34 A skeleton!
00:15:36 Fuck my asshole!
00:15:38 Because Donald Trump is a skeleton.
00:15:40 So he has bones to pick with him.
00:15:42 That's true.
00:15:43 He's so evil, he's literally a skeleton.
00:15:45 There we go.
00:15:46 Alright, good work, good work.
00:15:47 Keep it up.
00:15:48 So as you can see, the game is really getting...
00:15:51 You're just bad.
00:15:53 Oh, and you gotta get the check marks to, like, progress shit.
00:15:57 Oh, I see now.
00:15:59 What game is this?
00:16:00 It's M'Beebley's Quest.
00:16:01 Well, it's Santa's Quest.
00:16:03 It's an independent funded game.
00:16:06 The best game ever made by a gay furry.
00:16:09 No!
00:16:10 I don't know.
00:16:11 I have played it.
00:16:12 If you lose this game, that means we'll have to fucking vote for Trump.
00:16:17 Oh, no.
00:16:18 Anything but that.
00:16:19 Um, yeah.
00:16:20 This game is the hardest game.
00:16:22 Oh, no!
00:16:23 Did you see how much fucking damage it took before?
00:16:25 It was ridiculous.
00:16:26 Quite a bit, quite a bit.
00:16:28 It was a sin.
00:16:29 I forgot.
00:16:30 Are you playing on M'Beebley's difficulty?
00:16:31 No!
00:16:32 I am playing on M'Beebley's difficulty.
00:16:33 Okay, good.
00:16:34 So you're playing like a real boy.
00:16:35 Ah!
00:16:36 No, it's Mediton!
00:16:37 It's Mediton!
00:16:38 It's Undertale!
00:16:39 Why is this game such a fucking bitch?
00:16:40 That is a Mediton.
00:16:41 Uh-oh.
00:16:42 Uh-oh.
00:16:43 Uh-oh.
00:16:44 It's like it's taking out a mega ton of info.
00:16:47 It's very name-based, man.
00:16:49 No!
00:16:50 Shit!
00:16:51 Undertale!
00:16:52 Shit!
00:16:53 Undertale!
00:16:56 Sin!
00:16:58 Sin!
00:16:59 Sin!
00:17:01 It's Mediton, Sin!
00:17:05 You know Mediton!
00:17:09 Shit.
00:17:10 Okay.
00:17:11 Sin, help me clear my semen from the Disneyland Hot Topic area!
00:17:17 Disneyland Hot Topic!
00:17:19 Shit!
00:17:20 Goddamn it!
00:17:21 I think I must goddamn damage that shit.
00:17:22 Oh, Shans!
00:17:23 I love wingmunch!
00:17:30 Sin's real relatable like that.
00:17:33 You know what they say, Shans?
00:17:35 Everyone is a Sora, and everybody else deserves a fuck.
00:17:38 Say it or not.
00:17:39 Say it or not, Shans!
00:17:41 Yeah, something like that.
00:17:42 Are you saying it or not?
00:17:44 Shans!
00:17:45 Where the fuck is Mickey the Mouse?
00:17:51 Shans, why doesn't Donald Trump view me when I ask him?
00:17:58 Shans, why doesn't Trump love gay assholes like me?
00:18:07 He's my president, Shans.
00:18:09 I just don't listen like I love you.
00:18:11 I just wanna help the Trump!
00:18:14 I can't help the Trump.
00:18:17 I love video games, though.
00:18:19 The only thing I love more than Donald Trump is video games.
00:18:23 Sam.
00:18:24 Shans, please.
00:18:25 But only Triple A once.
00:18:26 Shit, no!
00:18:28 Yeah, I only love Triple A games like this one.
00:18:30 Shans, why is Ben Saint to Ben Saint?
00:18:35 Why is he shit at everything?
00:18:37 I am the best gamer.
00:18:39 I play on the hardest difficulties, and my experience reflects that.
00:18:44 Shut up, Vincent.
00:18:46 No!
00:18:47 We're acting like you're a separate character.
00:18:51 It's an autobiography.
00:18:56 It's an autobiography.
00:18:58 Called Tiberius Rising.
00:19:02 Like Monkey Jones.
00:19:04 No!
00:19:05 You guys see Monkey's new autobiography about his school shooting?
00:19:10 Yeah, I think it's more of like a manifesto of future plans.
00:19:13 More like a hagiography, you know what I'm gonna say?
00:19:15 More like a hate crime.
00:19:17 Oh, the next lives.
00:19:19 Oh, fantastic.
00:19:20 Just in time.
00:19:21 Everyone's having a great time.
00:19:22 I love the guys.
00:19:23 Those guys are having the most fun.
00:19:24 I wish I were them.
00:19:25 Are they raving or having a seizure?
00:19:26 It's hard to tell.
00:19:27 They were having a rape.
00:19:28 They don't even have anatomy, so who can say?
00:19:31 That's true.
00:19:32 Oh, dude, you see how with such dispassion and skill...
00:19:35 No!
00:19:36 Jesus!
00:19:37 I'd never say anything.
00:19:38 Please go on about your great skill at video games.
00:19:41 Never ever be good at games.
00:19:43 Perhaps I will.
00:19:44 Perhaps I will.
00:19:45 Shand, I actually pissed my poop into the fighting Nemo's submarine at Disneyland.
00:19:54 Oh, dear.
00:19:55 Oh, dear.
00:19:56 What are we gonna do with you?
00:19:57 We're continuing adventures of Shand's babysitter.
00:20:00 What's his name?
00:20:01 The Undertale fan 589?
00:20:02 No, the Undertailer 587 or something.
00:20:06 Yeah, some of the Undertailer.
00:20:08 We spent a lot of time perfecting his character.
00:20:11 Yeah.
00:20:12 He's got a rich lore.
00:20:13 We totally remember his name and everything.
00:20:14 They call him the New Cold Corona.
00:20:16 I do have the New Cold Corona on the Undertailer 589.
00:20:21 I have no wonder if this guy is just calling his carer Sans because he loves Undertale so
00:20:27 much, or Sans is actually his carer.
00:20:30 His carer?
00:20:31 I mean, I always vision him in like a Satan orange fur, like praying to Sans to grant these
00:20:36 wishes that he wants.
00:20:38 I guess that was the interpretation of the Undertailer 589.
00:20:42 This is that rich lore we were talking about.
00:20:43 Yeah, exactly.
00:20:44 We're gonna have a zone of psychophedia or dramatic, or we're just like CWC.
00:20:49 Exactly.
00:20:50 There's gonna be tons of fan theories.
00:20:51 The Undertale.
00:20:52 Sans, stick your head down my lemon pipe and suck out the bot flies.
00:20:58 I can't feel my skin.
00:21:01 Holy shit, that's disgusting.
00:21:05 I hate that so much, dude.
00:21:07 I hate that so much.
00:21:09 Highly offensive.
00:21:10 Sans, I opened the umbrella in my asshole again.
00:21:17 Tell me, Sans, tell me.
00:21:19 Get the god and she is.
00:21:23 It's very important you get the god and she is.
00:21:27 Nothing else will do.
00:21:30 You guys see that fucking skill just there?
00:21:32 I did, I did.
00:21:33 Sans, I was almost killed by a creeper in Minecraft when I killed him.
00:21:37 Oh fuck.
00:21:38 Sounds like everything's working out here, Undertale.
00:21:40 Also, my dick is stuck in the toaster.
00:21:44 I love to dance.
00:21:45 You have to if you want to survive that thing.
00:21:47 Oh, I get it.
00:21:48 He's so good.
00:21:49 Yeah, he's right.
00:21:50 Oh god, here we go.
00:21:51 Is it our boy?
00:21:52 It's Flowey!
00:21:53 You know, this is too shape number.
00:21:56 No!
00:21:57 You read time!
00:21:58 It died!
00:21:59 Okay, it's okay.
00:22:00 I gotta concentrate.
00:22:01 I gotta concentrate.
00:22:02 You turn into Alphys when you die.
00:22:05 You turn into something worthless.
00:22:08 No!
00:22:09 No!
00:22:10 No!
00:22:11 Oh god, okay.
00:22:12 Alright.
00:22:13 Okay, brutal.
00:22:14 You still got this.
00:22:15 I might.
00:22:16 You're fine.
00:22:17 Everything's fine.
00:22:18 This is the easiest game ever made.
00:22:19 That's right.
00:22:20 That's what they tell me.
00:22:21 Oh god.
00:22:22 Oh god.
00:22:23 Ah!
00:22:24 Ah!
00:22:25 Ah!
00:22:26 No!
00:22:27 Ah!
00:22:28 He's booking it.
00:22:29 This guy reminds me of one of those little kids from Dr. Seuss.
00:22:35 This guy reminds me of my middle school teacher.
00:22:39 Okay, okay.
00:22:40 I got two more chances.
00:22:41 Yes.
00:22:42 Love the dance.
00:22:43 Love the dance.
00:22:44 Fuck it up.
00:22:45 Fuck it up.
00:22:46 Kill that nigger.
00:22:47 Kill that nigger.
00:22:48 Right on the map.
00:22:49 Fuck up.
00:22:50 I hate myself.
00:22:51 Very upset.
00:22:52 We hate you too.
00:22:53 Aw.
00:22:54 Not at all.
00:22:55 Okay, alright.
00:22:56 Maybe you have to be with you.
00:23:00 Yes, this guy.
00:23:01 Oh, like just go under it.
00:23:06 Oh, that's gonna make it way easier.
00:23:09 Yeah, yeah.
00:23:11 There you go.
00:23:13 Alright.
00:23:14 There you go.
00:23:15 Okay, that's a strat.
00:23:17 Sans, give me the ultimate strat.
00:23:22 I want to be Undertale!
00:23:25 Hello!
00:23:26 Why is Undertale so fucking hard?
00:23:28 I don't even remember this part of the game.
00:23:31 I'm very so disappointed.
00:23:32 This is the DLC, the Greedy Jew, the Tobey J Foxx release.
00:23:37 Tobey, why do you hate Mexicans and women and also the black people?
00:23:43 Well, I mean…
00:23:44 What are you talking about, Munchie?
00:23:46 Yes.
00:23:47 Munchie J Foxx.
00:23:49 Munchie the bitch.
00:23:52 Munchie J Foxx is my real life OC.
00:23:55 He's Tobey Foxx's brother and Andrew Hussie's dad.
00:23:59 Shit!
00:24:00 Oh, no!
00:24:01 I love his beard shape and I just can't even read.
00:24:06 Okay, I'm gonna blast through it.
00:24:09 Okay, alright.
00:24:11 See, I know all the strategies for the level now.
00:24:13 Why does that elephant have to play the game?
00:24:16 See, it's like Dark Souls, you know, they run.
00:24:19 It's like Dark Souls.
00:24:20 First thing off the bat?
00:24:22 Nothing.
00:24:24 Okay, I'm really doing good so far.
00:24:29 Did you guys know that Ben Stain's skill at video games is directly proportional to
00:24:34 how much money he has on paper?
00:24:37 That's right.
00:24:38 Pledge now.
00:24:39 Pledge now.
00:24:40 Stop sucking.
00:24:41 It's within your power.
00:24:42 Yeah, I don't know.
00:24:43 Maybe that'll get people to un-pledge.
00:24:45 That was my plan all along.
00:24:47 The quality of the video is directly proportional to how much money he has.
00:24:51 Your entertainment.
00:24:52 Your entertainment.
00:24:53 Whatever that means to you, it's totally different.
00:24:57 You could just watch a better let's player for free, but when you're invested at this
00:25:02 point, you don't even try to do that.
00:25:04 Wouldn't you rather watch me beat this game and be the coolest guy ever?
00:25:07 Shans.
00:25:08 Shans!
00:25:09 I want Patreon money, but nobody loves me.
00:25:13 Shans, I tried to use my game furry comic about furry gaming, but no give me money.
00:25:20 Shans, I want to play video games, but I don't know how to make money doing it.
00:25:25 Hey, why don't you just call yourself Ben Stain and make yourself a let's play channel?
00:25:30 All Ben Stain.
00:25:31 And change your words.
00:25:32 Oh my God.
00:25:33 The lore is that the Undertale are 5 and 7.
00:25:35 Oh my God!
00:25:38 I was commanded by Shans.
00:25:40 Shans.
00:25:41 And what?
00:25:42 You can't disobey that.
00:25:43 Shans granted you the grace to make you use Shans.
00:25:45 His pupils went all black, and I was like, oh, better do it.
00:25:49 I think I'm real serious.
00:25:52 Yeah.
00:25:53 Shans, why am I so bad at Pokemon training?
00:25:57 Too real.
00:25:58 I don't know.
00:25:59 I bet Shans is too real.
00:26:00 Too real.
00:26:01 Too real.
00:26:02 Too real.
00:26:03 What would Shans, if Shans were a gym leader, what type would he be and what would his team be?
00:26:08 Boat.
00:26:09 Ghost.
00:26:10 Boat.
00:26:11 He'd be ghost type.
00:26:12 Yeah, that makes sense.
00:26:13 Yeah.
00:26:14 Well, sorry for my shitty question.
00:26:15 I didn't even think of it.
00:26:16 It's okay.
00:26:17 You have to promise to never speak to him.
00:26:18 Cubone is rock type, isn't he?
00:26:20 He's ground type.
00:26:21 He's ground, you fucking Marowak.
00:26:23 And Marowak is ground too, yeah.
00:26:24 Well, now it's fire ghost.
00:26:26 Yes.
00:26:27 Which I guess, I don't like it.
00:26:29 I came down on the side and I don't like the old Marowak.
00:26:32 Is he still holding a bone?
00:26:33 Yes.
00:26:34 What's the lore with new fire Marowak?
00:26:36 I don't know.
00:26:37 He's a fire boon.
00:26:38 He's a fire thingies that they use in Hawaii.
00:26:40 Yeah, he does.
00:26:41 But why would he change his type just because he took up a fucking new hobby?
00:26:45 Because it's sick and it has a good typing.
00:26:47 It's a video game.
00:26:49 If something is a new type, he just happens to be able to burn.
00:26:51 Well, except there was already...
00:26:53 I think the thing that sucks is that Cubone isn't also different.
00:26:56 Yeah, that's kind of weird.
00:26:57 That does really suck.
00:26:58 Like, if it was just Cubone, it's just different.
00:27:00 Oh, I already beat it.
00:27:01 I think what they should have done is they should have just...
00:27:03 Every one of the original Pokemon should have had it a little more.
00:27:06 They should have not have been a lazy cunt.
00:27:09 Go watch the good, great video on Hippocrates channel.
00:27:14 Yeah.
00:27:15 Where he says, fuck that shit.
00:27:17 And then you just go watch the Hippocrates video.
00:27:19 I think I just stole your point about realizing it.
00:27:21 Yeah.
00:27:22 But it's not as important as everyone else.
00:27:23 And there's what?
00:27:24 There's like 10 of them or something?
00:27:25 15?
00:27:26 I can't remember.
00:27:27 Not a lot.
00:27:28 What, a lowland form?
00:27:29 Yeah.
00:27:30 There's like...
00:27:31 It's like a dozen or something.
00:27:32 No, there's a bunch.
00:27:33 They're all...
00:27:34 I really don't think there's that much more than a dozen.
00:27:36 Hippocrates.
00:27:37 Yeah.
00:27:38 Has a fantastic...
00:27:39 Fuck!
00:27:40 Oh, I could have easily...
00:27:41 I could have easily...
00:27:42 There's like 16 or so lowland forms.
00:27:44 Yeah.
00:27:45 Yeah.
00:27:46 The variety in this game is really...
00:27:48 I think the biggest problem with Pokemon is that they just...
00:27:51 They kept making like 100 new Pokemon at a time.
00:27:53 So instead of just making 20 new Pokemon and like refining the gameplay.
00:27:57 Yeah.
00:27:58 Well, there aren't some big changes.
00:28:00 I think there's both of them.
00:28:01 Tom, they make like 70 new Pokemon now.
00:28:03 Well...
00:28:04 They don't...
00:28:05 They never make like 100 anymore.
00:28:06 Not anymore.
00:28:07 Not anymore.
00:28:08 They should only do like 20.
00:28:10 Why don't they just fucking do both?
00:28:11 Yeah.
00:28:12 They just don't want to.
00:28:13 Yes.
00:28:14 No.
00:28:15 Sounds like they can't make new Pokemon.
00:28:17 Sounds like they got kicked out of the blue bar.
00:28:20 You might wish you might smack one to literally every dish they serve there all day, all week.
00:28:27 They all...
00:28:28 Look.
00:28:29 I'm sorry that I...
00:28:30 Was a normal goal.
00:28:31 Now there's like...
00:28:32 You want to catch 1,000 Pokemon, you need to have autism.
00:28:35 Oh, come on Tom.
00:28:36 That is not fair to be like, oh now there's too much stuff and I don't want to do it all.
00:28:40 Exactly.
00:28:41 Well, okay, but that's why they invented the National Pokedex or whatever that lets you
00:28:45 only...
00:28:46 You catch all the Pokemon from that region, that's like a first tier accomplishment.
00:28:49 But that's not really catching them all.
00:28:51 Like you know that.
00:28:52 Well yeah, but you know, that's on you.
00:28:53 Nobody has ever cared about catching them all except for asking.
00:28:56 You did when you actually could catch them all.
00:28:58 Now you can.
00:28:59 I just...
00:29:00 Tom, you're saying that the game would be better if there was less of it.
00:29:03 No, no, no.
00:29:04 Sometimes that's true.
00:29:05 Sometimes.
00:29:06 I think if the focus was put on adjusting the game mechanics all the time and adding
00:29:10 just a few new Pokemon...
00:29:12 By adjusting the game mechanics, do you mean buffing Pokemon that are clearly shaped?
00:29:16 I don't actually...
00:29:17 Honestly, to be completely fair, I don't know what that would entail because I've never
00:29:20 sat down and actually thought about it.
00:29:22 I'm just saying I think of that time spent in coming up with like a hundred new monsters.
00:29:26 You're so big and undertale.
00:29:31 It needs twenty more dollars guys to get better.
00:29:34 If I don't make it this time, either I'll pick a new game or I'll just pick a new level.
00:29:39 If you're on dot com slash Tommy all over.
00:29:42 Tom, I agree that there are a lot of Pokemon that are bad and they should just fix them
00:29:47 all and that would be easy to do.
00:29:50 But also they should just keep adding more Pokemon because I like new Pokemon.
00:29:54 I like new Pokemon too.
00:29:55 I don't know if the focus on time...
00:29:59 There's so many more now.
00:30:01 Is hurting or enhancing?
00:30:03 I don't think it should be hard to do both.
00:30:07 I really don't get why.
00:30:08 Everyone says, oh they couldn't have made you be able to ride any Pokemon.
00:30:12 They would have had to model all these Pokemon.
00:30:14 Yeah, they should have just modeled all the Pokemon because they're fucking Nintendo.
00:30:17 Well, I don't know how much of that is they were too lazy or how much of that was
00:30:21 they're using a shitty cartridge that doesn't have a lot of space.
00:30:24 Well, both are their own Pokemon.
00:30:26 I will say that if they had less Pokemon, it would have been much less work to model
00:30:29 all the Pokemon.
00:30:30 But they only did one.
00:30:32 You don't fuck out of here.
00:30:35 What's up? What do you got there?
00:30:38 Where are you going to put them?
00:30:42 Yeah.
00:30:43 This means plastic.
00:30:44 Oh, here we go. Here we go.
00:30:46 The Jesse Defense Squad.
00:30:48 This is the glass versus plastic.
00:30:50 Oh, the glass thing.
00:30:54 Right, but glass is good for doing experiments.
00:30:57 You have your beakers to shit because plastic.
00:30:59 And when you drink out of plastic, little bits of butane can get in your water.
00:31:02 What sounds to me what you're saying is that plastic is for cool people and glass is for bad people.
00:31:06 What I'm saying, what I'm saying is that glass has uses and plastic has uses.
00:31:10 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:31:13 Windows.
00:31:15 You could theoretically make plastic.
00:31:18 Yeah, but they're better at keeping them in when they're made of glass.
00:31:21 I'm sorry about heat. I care about plastic.
00:31:24 Well, you know, in Star Trek, there's transparent aluminum.
00:31:26 Do you not have the windows in Star Trek?
00:31:29 Yeah, we're the Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers.
00:31:33 The most important show.
00:31:35 Okay, let's now officially wrap up.
00:31:37 Also, I'm pretty sure you're really mad at us.
00:31:39 So close the door, come in here or leave if you don't want to come in.
00:31:42 But you can come in. Okay, well, alright.
00:31:44 Okay, okay. Bye.
00:31:46 Yeah, I know what you're doing.
00:31:48 Sam's a little ass full of made of glass and plastic.
00:31:52 Sam's a little ass full of made of glass and plastic.
00:31:54 So much! Just like my Iron Man saying who I am also.
00:31:59 No! I was doing good at that time.
00:32:01 No, one more. No, one more. I'm good.
00:32:03 Sam's, I was up to Ben St. so much in the fact that he can't do anything right just like me.
00:32:09 Why didn't you go to the cave?
00:32:11 He's a real role model.
00:32:12 Because I want to beat this level.
00:32:16 You guys aren't hurting my feelings. The game is hurting my feelings.
00:32:19 I'm hurting my own feelings by letting myself down.
00:32:22 Excuse me, I sniz.
00:32:24 Quick being a Rowdy Fucker.
00:32:25 You cop killer.
00:32:27 That's right.
00:32:28 Sam, well on Splash Mountain, I puked and peed in front of the people but they didn't notice
00:32:33 because you know like the water was like splashing and I liked it.
00:32:37 Just want to let you know.
00:32:38 You know, I really wonder if the Undertale, if the Undertailer is also, you know, at Drill or Wint on Twitter.
00:32:45 They seem to have a lot of similar thoughts.
00:32:47 Oh my god, I saw that every treat by Drill is such a masterpiece.
00:32:51 They're wonderful.
00:32:52 The latest one I saw was like, adorn your front door with a festive welcome mat or go to hell.
00:32:59 Yeah, that's right.
00:33:01 What a legend.
00:33:05 Does anyone know what his icon is?
00:33:08 It's Jack Nicholson.
00:33:09 Jack Nicholson.
00:33:10 That's what I thought.
00:33:11 I don't know from what.
00:33:12 I really want to know exactly what it comes from.
00:33:15 One day I'll find out.
00:33:17 It's some random movie where he actually is just saying Drill at that very point.
00:33:21 Maybe, maybe.
00:33:22 Drill!
00:33:23 So long suckers I say, revving my motorcycle, making a huge cloud of smoke.
00:33:28 When it clears, I'm lying there, completely dead.
00:33:34 That's a great one.
00:33:36 He has a poetic gift.
00:33:38 He's so fucking funny.
00:33:41 I like followed his links on his Twitter to his website or whatever.
00:33:44 Yeah.
00:33:45 It was weird.
00:33:47 It was some kind of comedy that wasn't that great and there was some animations I think.
00:33:53 I don't even need that potion.
00:33:56 This guy.
00:33:57 This guy fucks.
00:33:59 Maybe I can get it later.
00:34:01 This guy has fucking sex and I relate to that because I also have sex.
00:34:07 Please have sex with the all women in the audience.
00:34:10 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
00:34:14 Don't listen to him.
00:34:15 He just wants to get your attention so he can shut you down.
00:34:18 If you're a sexy lady.
00:34:19 Don't listen to the same.
00:34:20 And you have Snapchat and Nate Bestman so you can have sex with me in the future.
00:34:25 Yeah, eventually.
00:34:26 All of them in the audience.
00:34:28 Then please message me so I can kill you.
00:34:30 Send me a, send me a, send me a, send me a telegram and I'll fax you my address.
00:34:38 All women.
00:34:39 Please kill you.
00:34:44 All women.
00:34:45 Please kill yourself.
00:34:47 Sad doesn't like women.
00:34:49 He told me to kill women.
00:34:53 You're gonna die.
00:34:54 You're gonna die.
00:34:55 You're gonna die.
00:34:56 A bunch of dirty bitches.
00:34:59 Frisk is a boy dude.
00:35:01 I'm a mooch out now.
00:35:04 Dude, sense of the all women.
00:35:07 Obviously.
00:35:08 I thought McDowell was a wrestler.
00:35:11 He should be.
00:35:13 Oh, you're blowing boyo.
00:35:15 I don't even know what that thing is.
00:35:17 It's a shame.
00:35:18 How long can you stay in those things?
00:35:20 I don't actually know.
00:35:22 Maybe.
00:35:23 Freda?
00:35:24 Maybe I can.
00:35:25 Maybe a test.
00:35:26 Is there another time to find out?
00:35:28 Oh.
00:35:29 Forever.
00:35:30 Well that makes it easy.
00:35:31 Ah, shit.
00:35:32 Ah, shit.
00:35:37 Whatever, I got two more lads.
00:35:41 Give me tranquility so I can defeat my foes.
00:35:48 Give me the tranquility to know the difference or whatever.
00:35:52 Yeah, yeah.
00:35:54 To fight my crippling outhaul.
00:36:00 Sad dude.
00:36:01 Yeah, it is sad.
00:36:02 The lore is deep.
00:36:04 The Undertaleers had a tough life, dude.
00:36:06 Yeah.
00:36:07 Why do you think he's come to Sands for coming in his great old age?
00:36:12 He's also 85.
00:36:14 Oh no, in my experience he was like 28 at most.
00:36:18 28, 82, whatever, same thing.
00:36:20 Oh.
00:36:21 Sands!
00:36:22 I just came because my future self didn't say it just completed a level in the video game.
00:36:28 Yeah.
00:36:29 I must have gotten a donation on Patreon.
00:36:31 Boost your finger power.
00:36:35 I got a mighty hammer.
00:36:37 A mighty hammer.
00:36:38 A mighty hammer to fucking brain one of those farm animals standing in the way.
00:36:43 Progressing on my quest.
00:36:45 Hell yeah.
00:36:47 This has a lot of cool imagery.
00:36:49 I just realized that you have a poster of your own art.
00:36:53 Someone sent, when that guy sent Digi like a hundred fucking anime posters,
00:36:58 he sent me one that was my comic and he sent Davoo one that was, I forget what.
00:37:03 Oh, it was his waifu, Annabelle or whatever from Kirby 64.
00:37:08 There was one of the Maya and there was one of the...
00:37:10 That was a weird waifu choice.
00:37:11 Yeah, Davoo's got a weird waifu.
00:37:13 No, waifu!
00:37:15 Anyway, this is a meme.
00:37:17 Oh shit.
00:37:18 Okay, that thing's alive.
00:37:19 No.
00:37:20 This is a meme level because it's all about hats.
00:37:26 It seems that I want to play TF2 anymore maybe.
00:37:43 Yeah I know.
00:37:46 So, I probably shouldn't bother to continue this level, but I will.
00:37:48 Yeah, be the legend.
00:37:49 I don't know what this hat does.
00:37:50 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, just, yeah, all right, you got it.
00:37:53 You could have jumped, you could have.
00:37:54 Just go down one at a time, man.
00:37:55 I know it does something.
00:37:57 I am.
00:37:58 Oh, Twitter hashtag, follow me.
00:38:02 Follow me at TheUnderTaylor.com slash forward, fuck you.
00:38:07 We should make a Twitter for the underTaylor.
00:38:09 Yeah, I'm gonna make that right now.
00:38:11 The Undertaylor 587, yeah.
00:38:14 Dude, you should just keep that Twitter going forever.
00:38:17 And just pray to Sands every day.
00:38:19 No, Sands, my fucking dick is, my, my Sands, my dick is fucked.
00:38:27 Sands have my seam is all over the orphans of India.
00:38:33 Hey, everyone, it's Jesse.
00:38:35 You are officially a Rowdyfuckercop.
00:38:36 Yeah, we're all Rowdyfuckercop killies.
00:38:38 We're doing a podcast right now?
00:38:39 Yeah, we're doing Rowdyfuckercop.
00:38:41 We're doing Rowdyfuckercop.
00:38:43 No, no, no, I'm sorry, I'll leave.
00:38:46 Whatever happened to anyone?
00:38:48 No, I can't do this, podcast is too many people.
00:38:53 Sands, I can't fucking suck dick if I can't see my dick.
00:38:59 It was adequately terrible.
00:39:00 No!
00:39:01 It sounds like it.
00:39:02 It sounds like you're all being weaves and fucking
00:39:04 plebes up there at the same time.
00:39:06 You're being something.
00:39:07 Yeah.
00:39:07 You're being a bunch of whiny bitches, is all you are.
00:39:09 I was, I was just sucking a lot of dick.
00:39:11 That's true, I didn't hear you much, which is a surprise.
00:39:13 You gotta love anime, dude.
00:39:14 You gotta love anime.
00:39:15 You gotta love anime, man.
00:39:17 You don't love anime.
00:39:18 Sands, I came.
00:39:23 Oh, Sands.
00:39:26 There you go.
00:39:28 I prayed to you for the orgasm, and it finally came out.
00:39:33 Oh, oh.
00:39:34 You should use words.
00:39:35 Anime is a mistake.
00:39:37 No!
00:39:39 Oh, yeah.
00:39:39 Sands, I shot a big boob in an anime at one point or another,
00:39:44 and holy shit, bro.
00:39:46 That boob was big.
00:39:48 I can't believe how big the boobs are now.
00:39:52 And when I was my age, they were like one or two,
00:39:55 and now they're like 500.
00:39:58 Is this the new awesome possum?
00:40:00 This is Mabeeblee's quest.
00:40:01 Oh, yeah.
00:40:02 This is.
00:40:03 Oh!
00:40:06 Mabeeblee's quest is over.
00:40:07 Don't judge me.
00:40:07 Sands, my future self, Ben St. is dead yet again in Miami.
00:40:14 This is Ben St. found dead in Miami.
00:40:18 Following a series of gruesome serial killings.
00:40:22 I like that, Jambi.
00:40:24 Isn't it great?
00:40:25 The guy who made all the big digi, all those posters.
00:40:27 He made that.
00:40:28 Awesome, man.
00:40:29 Yeah, he's a nice guy.
00:40:30 Yeah, he's a nice man.
00:40:31 Me.
00:40:32 No.
00:40:33 Oh.
00:40:34 That was a good save.
00:40:35 Yeah.
00:40:36 I thought that was done.
00:40:37 No!
00:40:38 You didn't know he was going to be there in time.
00:40:39 Yeah, right.
00:40:40 Yeah, right.
00:40:41 I didn't.
00:40:42 I was, I had positioned myself carefully before.
00:40:45 It seemed arbitrary, but in fact it was RNG manipulation.
00:40:48 Oh, okay.
00:40:49 You don't have to say that.
00:40:50 Patreon.com says bullshit.
00:40:51 Oh.
00:40:52 See, every time I die, I'm actually manipulating the RNG to give me a more favorable outcome
00:40:57 later in the level.
00:40:58 Yeah.
00:40:59 Really?
00:41:00 Absolutely.
00:41:01 Absolutely.
00:41:02 Hey, do you guys know that AGDQ is going on right now?
00:41:04 Yeah.
00:41:05 I'm following them.
00:41:06 Do you want to go?
00:41:07 Do you?
00:41:08 You could be watching that instead of Patreon.
00:41:09 No, no.
00:41:10 By now it's over.
00:41:11 No, don't leave.
00:41:12 Anyway, but yeah, the weekend's over, so it's all done.
00:41:14 Oh, really?
00:41:15 Okay.
00:41:16 Well, they do keep releasing videos on YouTube.
00:41:17 I look forward to it.
00:41:18 Have we done enough?
00:41:19 AGDQ.
00:41:20 AGDQ.
00:41:21 Awesome game.
00:41:22 The speedrunning.
00:41:23 The speedrunning.
00:41:24 Average game's done.
00:41:25 A toast.
00:41:26 Which I love.
00:41:27 I'm all about speedruns.
00:41:28 It's super fun to watch.
00:41:29 Bunch of games.
00:41:30 Hey, so they started watching more speedruns.
00:41:31 I understood why that one time you were like shout-outs to thing, because speedruns always
00:41:35 say shout-outs too, and then they'll name some totally random thing.
00:41:38 Shout-outs to data from something.
00:41:39 But yeah, I like the shout-out fictional characters.
00:41:42 They'll say shout-outs too, and then just say a thing that just happened in the game.
00:41:46 Maybe I did that unconsciously.
00:41:47 I think you must have been there.
00:41:49 I haven't watched a lot of speedruns.
00:41:51 Goodbye.
00:41:52 I'm never coming back.
00:41:53 Shem, I was at the Matterhorn bobsled race, and then when I saw the yeti, I just had to
00:41:59 have sex with her.
00:42:02 No!
00:42:03 Shem!
00:42:04 Shem!
00:42:05 No!
00:42:06 No!
00:42:07 No!
00:42:08 Oh!
00:42:09 Shem!
00:42:10 How could you do this?
00:42:11 Shem!
00:42:12 Shem!
00:42:13 Why would you create me in your image if I was also there going to be gay?
00:42:16 Well, you are not!
00:42:18 Oh my god.
00:42:20 This looks challenging.
00:42:21 No, no.
00:42:22 Does it?
00:42:23 No!
00:42:24 Oh yeah, he's a confirmed trans gay boy sexual.
00:42:28 Trans gay boy sexual.
00:42:30 No!
00:42:31 He's a straight, white male.
00:42:34 He's white, and he's male.
00:42:36 He can't be straight.
00:42:37 He voted for Hillary.
00:42:38 That's true.
00:42:39 He's a straight cuck male.
00:42:40 No, a white cuck boy.
00:42:42 He's clearly gloom gender.
00:42:44 That's true.
00:42:45 That's true.
00:42:46 Yeah, that's why he's always crying in all his fan colonies.
00:42:49 He's a boner boy.
00:42:52 He's probably what, polyamorous?
00:42:54 Because he's always got a boner for everybody.
00:42:57 Hey, you know who's polysexual?
00:42:59 Steve.
00:43:00 People made a plastic instead of glass.
00:43:03 Polyethylene, polypropylene.
00:43:06 Dude, my dick.
00:43:08 Yeah, I'm with you.

00:43:37 No!
00:43:40 I had it!
00:43:42 Shans!
00:43:44 You betrayed me!
00:43:48 That was just bad RNG.
00:43:53 That was just a bad roll of dice.
00:43:55 This time it'll be better.
00:43:57 Shans, when I was a little boy, I saw Megaman,
00:44:00 and I was like, why would I make that game?
00:44:02 I'm not with gay shit, and also I'm a furry,
00:44:05 and it's all fucked up, bro.
00:44:07 Thank you for then making Undertale.
00:44:10 Yes, this is very good Undertale.
00:44:12 Prime cut, if I was to say so.
00:44:15 Choice Undertale.
00:44:18 Oh, no, I'm fucking trapped.
00:44:21 Wait, you can jump on the platform to the right.
00:44:23 I'll die if I get hit once.
00:44:25 Then you're done.
00:44:26 You're a nigger!
00:44:29 You are a nigger!
00:44:32 I can do it, I can do it.
00:44:34 Oh, you can do it.
00:44:35 I can beat the game in every sense of the word.
00:44:39 Oh, boy.
00:44:42 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:44:44 Get that hat you packed up.
00:44:46 Oh, boy.
00:44:47 You didn't get the hat.
00:44:48 Quick a nap.
00:44:49 So you're wearing the hat now?
00:44:50 Okay.
00:44:51 I don't know what the hat does.
00:44:52 It's probably like, at the end,
00:44:54 you probably have to get into a tuxedo park.
00:44:57 Yeah, you have to have formal attire.
00:44:59 Oh, my God, you know what game we should fucking play
00:45:01 on this Clarence's Big Chance?
00:45:03 Literally the best game ever made.
00:45:05 It's pretty good.
00:45:07 Always kind of had ambitions to play that on T-Bat plays.
00:45:11 Yeah, right.
00:45:12 Maybe I'll just fucking do it on Ben Sains.
00:45:14 You should.
00:45:15 I fucking love Clarence's Big Chance.
00:45:16 I actually have completely forgotten why I liked that game.
00:45:19 Because it's fucking the best game in every way.
00:45:21 Well, yeah.
00:45:22 Just shut up.
00:45:23 Just shut up, that's all you need to say.
00:45:24 Well, you know this for me.
00:45:25 No, I'm not saying it's bad.
00:45:27 I'm just saying it'd be cool to play it again,
00:45:29 because I forget what was good about it.
00:45:31 Oh, Shads!
00:45:33 Shads!
00:45:35 Shads, why did you invent death that made me
00:45:39 experience it over and over?
00:45:41 He invented death.
00:45:43 That was a dick move, Shads.
00:45:46 He invented death just for this guy.
00:45:53 Shads!
00:45:54 Oh, Jesus.
00:45:55 Shads, why am I blind in the future?
00:45:58 I'm really shitting the page.
00:46:01 Yeah, by the way, guys, you're sitting on my bed,
00:46:04 which I literally shit in.

00:46:08 What?
00:46:09 I mean, where else would you shit?
00:46:12 Shads told me to.
00:46:15 Shads only shits on the toilet when I'm not looking,
00:46:19 so I don't know what's happening.
00:46:22 What is a toilet anyway?
00:46:24 What is a toilet?
00:46:26 If nothing but a wriggling mess of lies
00:46:29 and fucking that shit that you know when I'm showing it.
00:46:32 What is a toilet but a wriggling mess of lies?
00:46:36 It can't be real if my eyes are real, Shads.
00:46:40 You can't fool me.
00:46:43 Stick this semen down my lemon pipe,
00:46:46 and hopefully I will have two semen instead of one.
00:46:49 That's twice as many.
00:46:53 I can take one person in my town.
00:46:56 No!
00:46:57 I want to go, but I'm busy playing the best game in the world.
00:47:00 You can go if you want.
00:47:02 No, I don't want to go.
00:47:03 Okay.
00:47:04 Wait, can you pick me up? Everything?

00:48:22 Those fucking Nuggets don't know shit.
00:48:29 When I'm in the room with my Nuggets, they get very scared.
00:48:35 They go white like a sheet.
00:48:38 When I eat Shads, I love chicken nuggets because I hate blacks.

01:11:45 oh no oh
01:11:53 sans while getting on the Roger Rabbit car ride and toon town and Disneyland I

01:13:56 african america
01:13:58 oh yeah yeah you gotta make that
01:13:59 restrictor shat job

01:14:16 oh you got a thing
01:14:17 oh i guess you just have to not hit any of those
01:14:19 other bits
01:14:24 i hope that i hope that the fact that
01:14:26 i died to um
01:14:28 violent rock doesn't mean that like the fact
01:14:30 that i beat human eebly is erased
01:14:32 yeah though that may or may not even make
01:14:34 a difference
01:14:35 i feel like that might be possible
01:14:36 considering that like nothing happened
01:14:37 so maybe you had to hear the actual level
01:14:39 of gay pride
01:14:40 i don't think so i think cause like
01:14:42 next time you fight human eebly he has fewer
01:14:44 clothes on because you knocked his suit off
01:14:46 and like i knocked his suit off so i'm pretty
01:14:48 sure it counts
01:14:49 whatever counts he means
01:14:50 i mean you have to make him completely naked
01:14:51 you have to embarrass him beyond
01:14:53 yeah yeah the last time you fight him
01:14:54 he gets a stick out
01:14:55 really
01:14:56 these guys a little tallywack here
01:14:58 that
01:14:59 sexual shat
