00:00:00 Hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's another episode of your favorite podcast
00:00:12 that sucks. Hi everybody. Hi Ben. Gibbont's here. Digi's here. I'm here. And our guest this
00:00:23 week is Kazzy. Hey guys. I'm Kazzy. From the internet. From the internet. Hey guys. It's
00:00:29 Kazzy. It's Kazzy. Do you want to introduce yourself? Yeah, sure. To explain who you are.
00:00:35 Most of our listeners probably have heard of you. Yeah, sure. You can introduce me and
00:00:39 then I'll pick up whatever you like. Kazzy is an artist and a fursuit maker. Wow. That's
00:00:47 it. Yeah, that's it. I mean illustrator. I don't know. Yeah, illustrator. Primarily illustrator.
00:00:56 Yeah. Yeah, she paints. You make really good art that everybody should look at now. Thank you. Go
00:01:04 to Instagram and Twitter linked in the description. Yeah. Yes, based. Yeah, I do that mostly and then
00:01:11 I'm starting to be a fursuit maker. Just starting might do more of it. I don't know yet. Well,
00:01:19 you say you're just starting. Well, how much does it cost to buy a fursuit from you? That depends
00:01:25 on a lot of things like what like how detailed your character is and like do you want the full
00:01:32 thing or do you want like the head and the price range? Would you imagine the price range? Well,
00:01:38 um, I am working on one right now that is just a head set of paws and a tail and that was like
00:01:45 $750. Um, and that's almost done. It's not that bad. I guess if you wanted like the the big the big
00:01:55 dick one that's got like the padding in it, it's like your full body. Yeah, yeah. You know, standard
00:02:00 like normal complicated character design. Probably like, I mean, over over 2000,
00:02:05 um, somewhere around like last last year around there last year for like months and months.
00:02:13 Every time I saw you, you had a piece, you had like you would you would have like a hand or a
00:02:18 or a foot or something like in your bag and you would pull it out and be sewing on it and it took
00:02:26 you forever. It did. The thing about me to make it to make Colby Jack. Yeah, Colby Jack is my
00:02:32 show Colby Jack on screen right now. This is the thing I saw. I saw be pieced together like
00:02:38 Frank. I think we I think we showed this when it was completed on the PCP. Thank you. I remember
00:02:42 you telling Ellie Azar to show it. Yeah. And he did. Well, show it again. Yeah, show it again.
00:02:49 Yeah. I mean, the thing about him was that I mean, he was my second one that I had made.
00:02:55 My first one I made way back in high school and then the second one
00:02:58 um, took quite a while because I just decided to hand sew him and I really don't know why I
00:03:06 have a machine, but the pedal is missing for it. Um, so I don't know. I just decided I'll just take
00:03:13 forever on it, I guess. Hell yeah. Hand sewing is relaxing. Yeah. I would like to, I want to get
00:03:23 into sewing or keep convincing myself that I will, but like, this, you know, that's just another
00:03:29 thing to be doing. And I already didn't do too many goddamn things. I want to, well, I figure it's
00:03:35 probably a good thing to do while you're like watching stuff, right? Like, yeah, how mindless
00:03:41 is it? Like, can I, can I, is it more like I have to listen to a podcast or could I actually like
00:03:46 watch anime? Could I read subtitles and try to sew? It's like, um, like hundreds upon hundreds of
00:03:52 repetitive tasks that you could easily, like after a few thousand times, you don't even need to think
00:03:57 about what your hands are doing and yeah, you can listen to a lot of stuff. I'm just wondering if I
00:04:02 can read subtitles. Um, yeah, I mean, what would you want to make? Like clothes or, or what? Well,
00:04:07 yeah, I'd love to make, I don't know, everything. I would love to, I mean, ideally in my mind,
00:04:12 every aspect of my life would be DIY. Like it would have either be able to make everything myself
00:04:18 or have people around who know how to make everything and I can pay them to do it. But I would,
00:04:24 I want everything to be in house fashion. Yeah, if you had like, I mean, if you, if you, if you've
00:04:30 got a sewing machine, which is what you would use, you wouldn't hand sew clothes. Um, I have a sewing
00:04:37 machine. So, well, there you go. I mean, if you know how to use it and you just run the fabric
00:04:41 through. Yeah, I do know how to use it, but there's lots of different like types of stitching and
00:04:46 like ways to do it for different stuff. I guess I just gotta, you know, decide what I want to make
00:04:52 and then watch the video about how to make it. I guess it's probably not that different from cooking,
00:04:56 right? Like just follow the recipe. Yeah, it is exactly like that. It is just like, there is a way
00:05:03 to do it and there's plenty of resources to learn how online. And the same goes for fur suit making.
00:05:10 I always think about like, fucking, you know, sewing or, or, or like the,
00:05:16 what does it even call it, crochet that I was doing a while back and I made those little boots.
00:05:21 Stupid things. For, um, for Vriska, right? For Vriska. Yeah, I put this, she's still wearing
00:05:26 them because it is cold still. Um, um, and it's like, I think I just like the action and just
00:05:35 repeating the action. I don't really like following like, like having a big complicated like blueprint
00:05:41 and having to follow it precisely. I just want something to move my hands with while I think
00:05:47 or while I listen to stuff. So if, if I had like, like a big piece of fabric, I would just like,
00:05:52 I don't know, sew into it for no reason. Just, just put thread in it. I guess the only other
00:06:00 thing about me is that, um, I mean, I've, I've known you guys for, for quite a while. Um, and
00:06:07 that's true. Um, I guess you could say that this is Munchie's return because he is in the same
00:06:11 house as me. So he's technically here a little bit. Wow. That's amazing. That's incredible.
00:06:18 Wow. Maybe we'll hear a fart in the distance or something. Oh, that man does not fart. He does
00:06:25 not do it. I don't know why. I think he insists. Yeah, I think he mentioned that before that he
00:06:29 like insisted he does not fart or something. Yeah, no, it's true. After living with him for a while,
00:06:34 I can confirm it's true. It's fucked up. It's way fucked. Um, we were supposed to hang out on
00:06:42 Halloween. That's right. But then I canceled. We all canceled. Because of COVID, because of COVID
00:06:48 and snow, two, two big, two great tastes. Two of the worst things in the world, actually. Yeah.
00:06:54 Yeah. Yeah. You know what? My two least favorite things. Uh, I got exposed. I've been exposed to
00:07:03 COVID now. Yeah. Tell me about that. I'm, I'm a little bit worried about you. I saw on, on Twitter.
00:07:09 Well, it's probably okay. There's not that much to tell. It's basically just two of my roommates
00:07:15 work for this. Um, I guess it's a landscaping company. And I guess someone who they work with
00:07:20 got tested positive. And so they're, they're testing a bunch of other people from that company.
00:07:27 Those guys are getting tested on Wednesday. And so on Wednesday, I will know for sure whether
00:07:32 like, oh, did any of it get transmitted to them? Has it, has it been in my house? Right. Um,
00:07:38 okay. So it's not like sure if I, or anything yet. No, it's not, it's, it's not even like that
00:07:44 likely that either of them would have got it. Uh, and if, even if they got it doesn't, wouldn't
00:07:50 mean I would get it, but you know, it's, it's possible. It's quite, I mean, if you're in a
00:07:53 house together, it's pretty likely. I don't know what the chance is, but I feel like it would
00:07:59 probably happen. I've, well, I've heard that like, it's possible like within an apartment,
00:08:06 like with roommates and stuff, if you just have the person who is, has COVID use a separate
00:08:11 bathroom from everyone else, they can just keep it to themselves. That's what we did. We said,
00:08:17 those guys now, those guys got to use the downstairs bathroom now until, until they
00:08:21 get tested. Oh, the fucking, the fucking gross disgusting one. Which, which one? Well, you know,
00:08:27 I guess you could say the upstairs one, the upstairs one's clean now. The upstairs one
00:08:32 actually looks great. The upstairs one is, is fine and normal downstairs. I've seen,
00:08:38 I've seen some shit. Right. Well, I don't use that one. So that's, that's not on me.
00:08:44 You see, it feels like this, the place you would expect to see some shit is in the bathroom.
00:08:49 It's true. I saw some literal shit there one time and I never went back.
00:08:52 I thought this is unacceptable. It's a little, it's a little concerning. I mean,
00:08:58 before in the first wave, like I didn't know anyone that had it or like was in contact with
00:09:05 someone that was exposed to it. And now there's this with you, Ben. And then there was someone who
00:09:08 I used to be quite good friends with posted on Twitter that, you know, she's got it and her
00:09:11 whole family's got it. And it's scary. Yeah, the third wave is coming. It's going to be a big one.
00:09:20 It's a, we're fucked. We're totally fucked. I'm happy that I don't keep up with anything
00:09:25 that's ever going on anywhere. And I've no, I don't, didn't know there was a second wave
00:09:32 or a third wave on the way. What is the second wave? I thought this was the second wave.
00:09:37 Well, Matt, there's no third wave. We didn't have a second wave in Massachusetts yet because
00:09:43 we weren't into like super lockdown all through the summer. So we like didn't have the second one.
00:09:48 But now, yeah. I was literally unaware. It was big in March. And then they said lockdown.
00:09:55 And it went all the way down real low during the summer. And then it started creeping up again.
00:10:00 Now we're in a second lockdown. It's a second wave trying to cut that. We should probably,
00:10:04 we probably need a second lockdown right about now. Are we not in lockdown now? I guess not. Yeah.
00:10:11 You're back at school. Well, I mean, yeah, but I'm not going, I'm not going anywhere.
00:10:16 Like my classes are remote.
00:10:20 Right. Well, I don't know. I don't know if there's, I don't know what technically
00:10:23 constitutes lockdown versus quarantine versus whatever, whatever, just shut everything down.
00:10:29 Just, just, just burn it all down is what I would say. We got to start over.
00:10:33 You should return to monkey. Sure. Monkey.
00:10:36 Monkey, please hold out thine hand to me.
00:10:45 I don't know. COVID's pretty good. Can't wait. I will, I will, if I, if I get it,
00:10:51 I will buy the I Have COVID shirt from Teespring. I promise.
00:10:56 Why did you guys make that? The procrastinators affiliated I Have COVID shirt branded
00:11:01 procrastinators. Link, link in the description.
00:11:05 If you have COVID, you should buy it. That'd be like a monetary incentive for us to spread COVID
00:11:10 as far as we possibly can. I Have COVID and so can you. I mean, I can only imagine wearing that to
00:11:17 like a grocery store and getting subsequently kicked out of said store even if you don't have it.
00:11:23 It would just make, it would just make everyone avoid you and then you'd never get it.
00:11:29 You know, it's the best defense. No one would come near you. I don't know. If I saw someone
00:11:34 wearing a shirt that said I Have COVID, I would be very uncomfortable. Just because of the uncertainty.
00:11:40 Like, is that real? You probably assumed they were trying to warn you, right? Like,
00:11:45 I mean, they're doing a service. Either they were taking their warning very seriously or
00:11:51 they were like fucking with everyone. And, you know, that uncertainty I'd be like, I don't like this.
00:11:59 Uh, well, you know, you, you too listener can make everyone uncomfortable. I can't wait. I'm
00:12:09 looking forward to it. Um, hey guys, president of the United States of America, we got him. Here
00:12:18 we go. Our boy Jay Rob. We got our boy Jay Rob in there. I know now it's time. He's in there.
00:12:23 Kick grandpa's ass. I want corn pop for VP.
00:12:32 No, I'm not, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna stand Biden ironically anymore. It's not
00:12:38 funny anymore. I think I'm hugely excited if Biden really is president for the fact that
00:12:45 hating on the president, I feel like will be an uncontroversial opinion for almost everybody.
00:12:50 Hmm. It's, you know, it'll be very hard to hate. So far for the Trump presidency, it's like
00:12:58 we either really hate this man or you don't. Yeah. And you pretty much have to be on one side
00:13:04 of the other. I hated him, but like only as much as a normal president. So it was kind of weird
00:13:09 for me. But I also hate Biden as much as a normal president. But like, I don't think anybody in the
00:13:15 world like is going to step up to bat for this bad. Like nobody's going to get like weird defensive
00:13:21 over me shitting on Biden, including liberals. Like, I mean, certainly less so than with this
00:13:27 past presidency. Some of them do, but yeah. I can't think of anybody who I would encounter who would
00:13:32 be mad that I was talking shit about Biden like ever that in real, in real life. No, I don't know
00:13:37 anybody. I don't know. I feel like if anybody is is like, like, like legitimately excited for
00:13:49 Biden, they love him right now. Like, I think it's it's very much they probably got paid by him.
00:13:56 No, no, no, they're just like so happy that Trump is not there. And they're just re reconstituting
00:14:03 that happiness into Biden's so fucking cool. And then that'll wear off when they realize,
00:14:09 yeah, he's just the guy. I mean, it's just what it's just one of the other presidents,
00:14:13 like standing Biden is just a meme. Hopefully. Yeah. Yeah. For me, it was a meme, but now it's
00:14:20 over. It's not a meme. The one thing that is potentially good about Biden is that he does
00:14:24 just kind of do whatever he gets like paid or told to do. So like, maybe we can just literally
00:14:31 bully him into doing whatever we want. Like, I mean, that's the hope. That's the plan. Yeah,
00:14:37 I wonder how well that will work. But hopefully he's not gonna be like a super reactionary like
00:14:44 law and order like fucking crackdown kind of guy. He's more he's like, he's a little more
00:14:51 conciliatory. He has his base has a little bit more expectations of him to like, not, I don't
00:14:58 know, like violate the Constitution. I just think like Trump's way of doing things was like,
00:15:04 if you told him that he was wrong about something or did something bad, he'd just be like, no,
00:15:08 fuck you. And then, you know, maybe he'll stop doing it. Maybe he won't. But like Biden is like,
00:15:14 if you were if everybody was like, fuck you, you did this, then he would try to reason with people
00:15:19 and fail. Yeah. And that's why he might be invincible. Yeah, I agree. He's he
00:15:27 Democrats actually care about criticism for better or for worse. They they their feelings can be
00:15:33 hurt. Right. And like, I think that Obama was just like so charismatic that it was a lot harder
00:15:40 for people to want to just like tear into him. But like, Joe Biden's just like an old creepy
00:15:45 child molester. So it'll be really easy to tear into him. Yeah. No, I think you're right. Yeah. I
00:15:51 think hate hating on the Prez will be just something we can all as a nation get behind.
00:16:00 I agree with that. I don't know if you guys saw this, but I saw a clip getting passed around on
00:16:04 Twitter that was John McCain's concessions concession speech from 2008. And it was really
00:16:12 interesting. Have you not seen it? No, I don't think so. I would take a look. It's really interesting
00:16:18 to compare that to now because I mean, what we see now is the the president of the United States
00:16:27 throwing an absolute temper tantrum. Yeah, he looks very funny. He he is just like, I don't
00:16:37 I don't I don't know how to describe it picture of him in the white hat, like walking into the
00:16:41 White House like forlorn over his shoulder. Absolutely. And I watched this. I watched this
00:16:50 this speech from John McCain from when he lost in 2008. And, you know, aside from, you know,
00:16:56 his policies or whatever, when I listen to that speech, I like the the crowd starts
00:17:03 booing Obama at the beginning and he he settles them down, he gets them to stop.
00:17:08 And he's like, No, I'm happy for the guy. Like, I know that he wants to do what's best for this
00:17:14 country. All I care about is the good of America and the good of the people. And so, you know,
00:17:21 well, we have our differences. You know, you know, you know, he he he stepped he he lost with
00:17:26 grace. And it's such a world of difference from what we're seeing right now. It's it's incredible.
00:17:33 I mean, you got to you got to lose with if you lose, you might as well lose with grace. So like,
00:17:37 you don't look like an asshole to the current admit you should play nice with the people who
00:17:41 are going to be, you know, your bosses for the next four years. Also, I won't be the case for him
00:17:46 because he's not a politician. So for McCain, no, for for Trump, I'm saying that's why he wouldn't
00:17:52 have to play. Yeah, that's that's true. That's true. Yeah, I'll just try and like make his own
00:17:57 country. He's going to do Trump TV. Oh, yeah, I'm going to start a media empire. It's going to be so
00:18:06 sick. I'm so hyped for Trump TV. I really think I really think it's going to be great. And I think
00:18:12 this is like it's going to split. It's already or like officially announced to like multiple sources
00:18:18 have better be quote unquote better and less fake news than the media. He just wants to make
00:18:23 his own media. Oh, that's interesting. I mean, it'll be just propaganda, but
00:18:29 yeah, sure. I think I think I think it could really split the Republican vote,
00:18:33 which would be so great. That would just be the that would be the sickest thing.
00:18:37 I don't know. I don't know how much of the base he'll take with him. I've never been happier
00:18:43 about libertarians because of the shit that happens. Oh, yeah.
00:18:48 They literally cost him the election. I literally really did. And honestly, my favorite thing to
00:18:54 come out of this so far is to watch, you know, beside aside from Trump's meltdown himself,
00:19:01 the meltdown of the MAGA people is hilarious because in 2016, all they were doing after the
00:19:09 election was going like, oh, my God, look at these look at these liberals, you know, they're so
00:19:13 triggered by snowflakes and they're doing the exact same thing. There's like a slightly different
00:19:20 tone to it. But yeah, they're doing their version of it. I mean, what we see now is like all the
00:19:26 coping. I know, I love the cringe comps. I want more cringe comps. I've been I've been on poll
00:19:31 a bunch and it's all like, it's all like, you know, it's fraud, like, oh, look, the curve has a
00:19:36 squiggle in it. Oh, that's fraud. And like, it's like, no, no, Trump's going to take it to court.
00:19:41 Like, this is all part of the plan, guys. I don't know. That's very funny.
00:19:50 I think it's settling down. I don't know. I wonder how long, you know, no, no, it's not
00:19:55 going to settle down because I don't know, do you think Trump is going to fight it like all
00:19:58 the way up until Inauguration Day? Yeah. I think he will posture that he's going to fight it. I
00:20:05 don't actually know whether he's willing to go through all of that. But it's still possible
00:20:10 that he could, like, disrupt things all the way up until that moment. Yeah, I guess it depends on
00:20:15 how much people want him to do it. From what I've seen, it seems like people are mostly just kind
00:20:21 of like resigning. Like, I don't see a lot of people like, I mean, people are kind of assuming
00:20:27 that he's going to try to push it off. Like anybody I know who's like a Trump support,
00:20:31 like who cares about Trump at all is like, well, it's not technically decided, but like,
00:20:35 it's probably over. It could be overturned in the courts, but like the way the wind is blowing,
00:20:42 it's like even the people that want that are like, there's really no precedent. It's just not
00:20:48 close enough. It had to overturn multiple states. It just doesn't seem like something that's going
00:20:55 to happen. I watched, oh my God, did any of you like watch the fucking count come in on Georgia?
00:21:02 Yeah, I was up to that one. Oh, I didn't see it. I didn't see it turn. I didn't see it turn,
00:21:08 but I was keeping up with like exactly how many votes, you know, like several hours. It was
00:21:17 Georgia Georgia was was the margin was like 4,000 and then like 3000 and then like 2500. Yeah,
00:21:24 it went down to like 1700 before I like went to bed.
00:21:29 Um, yeah, I saw I think then I think you might have retweeted it, but it was something that was
00:21:33 like, you know, um, it was like retweet this if if your follower account, like, yeah, I did,
00:21:40 you know, could flip Georgia, could flip Georgia. And I looked and I was like even mine could at
00:21:46 that point when I looked when you when you posted that it got down to like, I think like, like
00:21:50 a thousand or less, yeah, like before it was like, oh my God. And it was like the the the report
00:21:56 was saying like 90 like over 98% of the vote was in. So it's like, well, what does that mean? Does
00:22:02 that mean like there's like a couple thousand votes left to count or does that mean there's 10,000
00:22:06 votes left to count? You know, uh, that was exciting though. That was and then, um, people were
00:22:13 people were talking about Pennsylvania flipping, but I was looking at the numbers and Pennsylvania
00:22:18 didn't seem anywhere near as close as Georgia. I thought like Georgia Georgia might flip and
00:22:22 that would be the only one. I felt the same way. And I just assumed that it was people who,
00:22:27 you know, understood politics more than me and that just are like, no, like we've run the numbers,
00:22:31 like we know it's going to flip, like we know how this is going to happen. It's just like,
00:22:35 all right, I guess I'll trust you guys. I don't know, though. It looks pretty,
00:22:40 it looks, it looks pretty much like an uphill battle. I mean, I wake up and it's flipped.
00:22:44 I felt, um, nervous because, you know, I had watched the results come in and like the New
00:22:52 Hampshire primary and the Iowa caucus and stuff. And I watched it like come out with like, oh,
00:22:57 Bernie looks like he's ahead really early on. And then like fucking Pete Buttigieg or whatever,
00:23:01 like closes the gaps, like, no, no, it's all slipping through my fingers. So, you know, I was,
00:23:07 I was prepared for a bad, for a bad time. Wait, did you guys see the, um,
00:23:15 like the Trump like, I don't know if it's a concession speech, but the, the Trump address
00:23:19 in like the, the like landscaping or like the hardware store parking lot?
00:23:24 No, not yet. No, I was planning on watching that after this.
00:23:28 I haven't watched it yet. But like they booked it. They tried to book like this speech at the
00:23:34 Four Seasons Hotel, but they accidentally booked it at like a landscaping company called Four Seasons.
00:23:39 So they're just, I'm still looking at the picture right now of fucking Rudy Giuliani giving a speech
00:23:44 in this like dirty gravel like driveway. Here, um, I'll, I'll, I'll show you. I, I saw like a photo
00:23:55 of it or something in it. I was like, guys, what the fuck is this? It all, it all ends here.
00:24:00 For holding press conference of Four Seasons Garden Center.
00:24:05 It's like, there's like construction going on in the background. It looks like next to like
00:24:09 some rusty beams. There's like an orange cone there on the ground.
00:24:17 The paint's peeling off the wall. Oh my God. I love it.
00:24:21 Oh man. I still haven't seen a Borat too. I guess I am probably going to watch it at some point.
00:24:29 Oh, I've just seen that screenshot floating around of Giuliani. Like,
00:24:34 looks like he's unzipping his pants or something. Yeah. On the bed. I saw that. I do. I didn't know
00:24:39 what it was until yesterday, um, because Munchie was telling me about it. I had no idea and he
00:24:44 showed me the clip. Um, and yeah, I haven't even seen the clip. It's, I mean, I don't, he's like
00:24:51 lying back on the bed and like, I mean, like shoves his hand in his pants and it's like fucking,
00:24:56 yeah, it's pretty clear to me. Yeah. What's going on there? I mean, yeah. I saw the, um,
00:25:01 Red Letter Media just did a half in the bag where they talked about Borat 2
00:25:06 and they discussed that and they, they said that it's like that part in particular is like clearly
00:25:11 they edited around to make it look worse than it was. It's still bad, but like, I don't know.
00:25:17 There's something sort of, well, they talk about it. I haven't seen the film.
00:25:22 I don't, I don't really know the whole context for like what's going on there.
00:25:27 There's an, oh, I'm seeing an, there's an Antifa thread on poll. That's interesting.
00:25:31 I'll have to check that out later and have to bookmark that.
00:25:36 Wait, are you part of poll's transition into being a leftist board? Well, well, I checked,
00:25:43 I checked poll. I haven't been posting there, but I checked it like as Georgia was flipping
00:25:48 and like, you know, everyone's making fun of, uh, uh, the MAGA atards or the meat or the
00:25:54 MEGA atards as they call them there, which I assume stands for make Israel great again.
00:26:00 Everyone on poll thinks that Trump is like super pro Israel, which I guess he probably is,
00:26:04 but like that's their, that's their big beef with them. Um, I've been reading it and yeah,
00:26:10 there's a lot of like, a lot of, I don't know, and I might settle down. I assume that it was like,
00:26:16 I assume that 4chan was like very like MAGA just because it made people mad and maybe now the way
00:26:23 to make people mad is to, uh, is to make fun of them. I think that's part of it. I don't think
00:26:28 they were as MAGA as people think. I think they weren't like a unified front for sure. I think
00:26:34 poll is just a lot more like of a weird radical identities. Just like, I mean, you, you can,
00:26:40 people have their like flags on their trip codes or whatever and like even, even before like, you
00:26:46 know, there are people in there who are like anarchists and communists. I guess it's like the
00:26:49 biggest, they might be trolls too. The biggest mistake people make about 4chan is that people
00:26:53 always think it's like a monoculture, but like the point of it in my mind is that every position
00:26:58 is represented there. So like, usually if you step into a thread, like if somebody starts a thread
00:27:04 with a dumb title, like, uh, is this anime good or bad? The first two responses almost without
00:27:09 fail will be it's great and it's shit. It's just like, like, I don't even know if those two people
00:27:14 really believe that or if they're just trying to make sure those are the first two responses,
00:27:17 just to like set the bar that like the dumbest possible responses have all been said right up
00:27:22 front. Now let's try to talk about it, you know, like, right. And so like, there are people who
00:27:29 are definitely playing devil's advocate. But not because they do or don't believe the things they're
00:27:35 saying, they only just want to argue about shit until they understand things better. They don't
00:27:40 care. They're not probably not even voting, you know, like, it's like, it's a place where all
00:27:45 conversation and knowledge is meant to coalesce. But very, you know, that includes all the bad
00:27:51 things and aggressive things and fucked things. So like, reputationally, it's more known for that
00:27:57 stuff. But if you go to any board, like part of it is people fighting against that stuff and making
00:28:01 fun of those people at the same time. Yeah. Yeah, sure. See, that's interesting. I don't really
00:28:06 know. I mean, I'm someone who's never been on 4chan at all. I don't know. It's a very different
00:28:14 website from, you know, the ones that I'm what I'm doing right now would be considered
00:28:20 it would be considered spoon feeding and would be considered a bad thing what I'm doing right now
00:28:24 by explaining 4chan. But like, oh, I know that. I know that. Yeah. Like, because in the reason for
00:28:32 that, which I kind of agree with is that like, because it used to be that I think the number
00:28:37 one rule on most boards is just lurk more, like, eventually, like if you come in and you immediately
00:28:43 react to whatever you see, then you probably don't understand why it's there, you know, like,
00:28:49 it might be that somebody just like says some incredibly racist shit or something and like,
00:28:52 you would go like, you know, freak out, I can't believe somebody said this, but like,
00:28:56 there might be a lot more to it, you know, and when you've been on a board long enough,
00:29:01 then you start to recognize like, you can tell what is a PSYOP and what is like a new person who's
00:29:07 literally just reacting to things and like, you know, who is a fed, which poll has a lot of feds.
00:29:14 So this yeah, man, I watched this one fucking speech with it was some kind of hearing. I think
00:29:21 it was when they were talking to the social media people, the government people were talking to the
00:29:24 social media people like six months ago. And like, three of the like governors or senators or
00:29:31 whatever, who were like the most hard ass, you had like the most serious actual questions,
00:29:36 legitimately dropped four Chan memes, like three different guys in a row. And I was like,
00:29:42 this is the feds on poll, like this is who they are.
00:29:47 I see. What were the memes? I don't remember this a while ago.
00:29:53 I'm sure I know it somewhere.
00:29:58 Yeah, poll poll right now is all it's all like, you know, election fraud, COVID threads.
00:30:10 Have you seen that curve that people post like the Biden and versus Trump counting curve where
00:30:15 like at the very end, Biden's like, the blue jumps up. Yeah. And they made it into like a logo
00:30:20 with an with an F for fraud. Yeah, the one you're talking about.
00:30:25 Yeah, that's the one. There's like, people post like other images, like there's other
00:30:30 counts in like other states where like, the voting is similarly like, you know, has like
00:30:34 weird jumps and gaps in it. And like, you know, the the the the MAGA guy is like furious about
00:30:41 this one where Biden jumps ahead. But then like, there's other ones that jump, they do all kinds
00:30:45 of weird shit. And he's got the NPC face like, yeah, no reaction. That's that's what it's all
00:30:53 about. That's what polls like right now. So, you know, I've been scoping it out. You know,
00:30:58 maybe I'll become a maybe I'll become a big, a big four chain guy again, now that it's been made
00:31:02 a safe space for me. Yeah, right. Probably not. It's just like, it's, you know, deciding times.
00:31:13 Everybody feels good when they feel like they're on the winning team. And I've been in a weird
00:31:18 superposition for for most of Trump's presidency. I feel like I was on the losing team, but not
00:31:25 being upset about it, like everybody else was. And now I get to be now I get to be on the team
00:31:34 that like, it's like everybody wins for me. Everybody who every like, I feel like a Biden's
00:31:41 presidency can somehow only mean positive things for me specifically, but not because
00:31:46 of the fact that it's going to be good. Like, in fact, the worse it is, the more fun it will be
00:31:53 for me. What do you care to elaborate? Well, because like, so, I mean, it's kind of like,
00:32:01 we already see on Twitter, like liberals immediately turning to bully on on Biden,
00:32:07 you and I have been doing it. Yeah, because I've been making I've been making some angry,
00:32:13 I've been making some nasty tweets at some shit libs. Yeah, it's true. It's just like,
00:32:17 it'll be so much easier to root out the problems in the liberal party when they're not all like
00:32:25 for the last four years, if you said anything negative about liberals, then you were like,
00:32:28 oh, you're going to make it so Trump can win again. Like, nobody can nobody can raise this
00:32:33 argument anymore. You know, we have, I don't know if Trump's going to try to run again.
00:32:38 Next election, I doubt it. Like, he might, he already got the big come of being president.
00:32:44 Like, I don't know what he got the big come of being president. He might got like, Don Jr.
00:32:49 something someone could run. Everyone's saying Tucker Carlson is going to run in 2024. That's
00:32:53 not going to happen. You don't think so? No. Why would he? I mean, he's got a regular normal job.
00:33:00 People always forget like being president fucking sucks. And like, most of the people who do it
00:33:03 are like raised from birth with the expectation that they're going to do it and like, you know,
00:33:09 live like a completely different lifestyle. Trump's like the only person I think who has been like,
00:33:15 I just want to do it to do it because I want to have done I want to have my name on everything,
00:33:19 including America, you know, like, so you just don't think that like, there's anything in it for
00:33:24 Tucker to do that. Right. I just don't think that like, I think most people who people are,
00:33:28 oh, you should be president or like, no, that sounds fucking awful. Like you have to kill people,
00:33:33 you know, you have to make like terrible fucking decisions all the time with like,
00:33:37 and everybody expects everything of you and everyone has an opinion on you about you on
00:33:40 planet Earth, you know, like, yeah, sounds kind of shit. So yeah, I don't know. I don't know.
00:33:48 I probably wouldn't enjoy it. But who knows, like rapid ages years. Well, yeah. Well,
00:33:59 who do we? Yeah, if I guess that's kind of an optimistic for me to think like, okay, well,
00:34:08 now that now that liberals are in power, it's easier. It's it's yeah, it's safer to criticize
00:34:14 liberals. Right. Well, and we can bring them you can criticize them from an even more leftist
00:34:19 standpoint of being like, Oh, well, like, let's take it even further. Like y'all aren't doing
00:34:24 enough, you know, and I think the Trump presidency radicalized more people to the left
00:34:30 than a Biden presidency will. But yeah, I think rhetorically, it makes it easier for those people
00:34:36 to yeah, I'm just saying if we if if somehow liberals can like talk Biden into instituting
00:34:43 UBI, then it'll have been worth it. Oh, that's a but Biden is like Biden is pro a couple of
00:34:51 things that are good. Like, I think he's pro $15 minimum wage, and he's pro like,
00:34:57 maybe student student debt forgiveness of UBI. Yeah. It's it's not it's not as good.
00:35:06 So like, he's he's good on a couple of things, and then shit on other things.
00:35:11 Like, he doesn't, he doesn't, he's like, oh, no, we should expand the Affordable Care Act.
00:35:16 No, government health care. But I don't know. I lost my train of thought. Fuck Biden.
00:35:25 Yeah. Fuck, I'm all fuck them all.
00:35:30 How how likely do you think it is that as soon as Biden does his inauguration speech, he trips
00:35:35 and falls down the stairs and dies and Kamala Harris. Oh, my God, it's like a lot more likely
00:35:41 believe it. It sounds Kamala. I saw a post that was like it's just going to be like four
00:35:47 years of like Mr. Magoo like like a Kamala is just going to be like setting like traps
00:35:52 for him and he's just going to be like Mr. Magoo. It's going to be shenanigans. You know,
00:36:00 I've seen a couple of things where like she's like mistakenly says when I'm president, meaning
00:36:07 when I'm vice president. Wait, has she really? Yeah, it's like, I don't know that she's thinking
00:36:13 about it, but she probably has like entertained the idea that because Joe Biden's so old,
00:36:19 I could get it. Did y'all see the pictures of Kamala Harris' family, the second black family to
00:36:27 be in the White House? Yeah, I did. Oh, actually, I didn't see that. Really? Wait, are those her kids?
00:36:36 No, that's like, I think she's like half white. Well, yeah, but like, are those like her stepkids?
00:36:43 Well, it looks like her dad, right? Or maybe those are maybe that is her family. Okay, I didn't
00:36:48 somehow I just assumed this was like, like her family as in her parents, but maybe that's her
00:36:54 husband and kids. I yeah. Can't we just click on this link? No, no, no, those those have got to
00:37:00 be those are her kids. I mean, those kids have to be her step kids. They have to be your step kids.
00:37:07 Hold on. Wait, right. It says, wait, wait, I have to make sure I'm looking at the right person,
00:37:16 because it says something about the Brooklyn born attorney has two children, Colin Ella named after
00:37:20 jazz legends, John Coltrane and Ella Fitzgerald. And I'm just like, are we talking about these
00:37:24 two white kids named after these legendary black musicians? Wait, wait a fuck, wait, just a goddamn
00:37:31 second here. What's what's going on? I got I got to get to the bottom of this. Maybe it's just
00:37:37 overexposed. That's what it is. Yeah, Kamala Harris have no, no, no, they're her stepkids.
00:37:47 Yeah, I was right. Okay. Yeah. She I don't think she has any like, you know, real children.
00:37:53 Lamal. That's a funny image, though, with that context. The second black. Wait, wait,
00:38:01 but so wait, so they're not they're her stepchildren. So they're his children. But they are white kids
00:38:08 named after John Coltrane and Ella Fitzgerald, which is still white people can like jazz. Did
00:38:13 you don't be racist? It's just funny to me. Okay. So I have an uncle who is like myself white,
00:38:20 who married a black woman. They have mixed children who similarly were named after Quincy Adams
00:38:26 and Langston Hughes, Quincy and Langston. But it's just funny to me, because these kids are fully
00:38:33 white and are named after specifically like black legends, which I'm just wondering what was the
00:38:41 inspiration and impetus? Are they actually fully white as they look in this picture? What do you
00:38:46 mean they're fully white? I thought you said they were have black. They are they are. I can
00:38:51 all they're not her children. So I can all the dad must just be a be a big fan of music history.
00:38:57 You know, I guess good for him. I'm just thinking about the episode of Atlanta. Have any of you
00:39:03 seen Atlanta? No, really good show. But there's an episode about the main characters going to this
00:39:10 rich white guy's house where he's just like really obsessed with black culture and Africa and stuff
00:39:15 and like, but it's portrayed as like extra bizarre and cringe worthy. And it's really funny. And that
00:39:22 just this guy naming his kids that reminded me of that. Like like the like that professor
00:39:29 in Harambe. Yeah, like Harambe. Like taken to the extreme because he's a rich guy with a mansion
00:39:35 who's like having a like a whole soiree there. So like his whole house is just decked out with
00:39:40 like all this Africa shit. And it's pretty funny. Good show. Highly recommended. Donald Glover's
00:39:47 TV show, if you know him. Kamala is such a fucking cop. Yeah, it's really a Kamala. So I call them
00:39:55 by Don and Kamala like Godzilla monsters. Because there was there was something where like when
00:40:01 she was announced as the VP, they had misspelled her name is Kamala on something. And Mooncult
00:40:08 on Twitter had pointed out that like she also got like a massive facelift between when she was
00:40:13 like in between. If you look at pictures of her back during the back during the whole fucking
00:40:20 what's it called the tryouts for president. What the fuck am I thinking of primary primary.
00:40:24 The primary. If you look at the pictures of her back during the primaries and then like leading
00:40:28 up to when she was announced like a month or so maybe before she was actually announced as the VP.
00:40:33 She had a major like facelift. So her face looks totally different. And so Mooncult was already
00:40:40 predicting that she was going to be the VP. But it was not Kamala anymore. It's Kamala. It's Kamala.
00:40:48 The one with an E. She is now like Gamera. She is now Kamala.
00:40:54 Everyone I knew when we saw her in the primary we we said Kamala. And then I had I had to relearn
00:41:02 because there was a little bit of a kerfuffle. It's like no. Everyone's saying her name wrong.
00:41:05 Kamala. Kamala. Kamala. It's now Kamala. By Don and Kamala. By Don versus Godzilla.
00:41:13 I like to call I like to call Biden J Robb short for Joseph Robinette. That's that's my
00:41:22 that's my image. Is this. This isn't true. It is. It's totally different. That just
00:41:29 no that just looks like a smear frame or something. Yeah. This is just like a it's
00:41:33 like a fucking low res screen. It's just like weird like in the middle.
00:41:39 I'm looking for for comparisons. I'm looking at I don't know like I'm looking at the before
00:41:43 and after pictures and like I can kind of see a difference but it could look at her cheeks man.
00:41:50 Look at her cheeks. They look different. I mean she is making a different facial expression. So
00:41:55 I really like people are definitely going out of their way to find the ugliest
00:42:00 little sort of screenshots to take. She's not a pretty woman. I mean let's be honest.
00:42:09 She's fine. I think she's actually older than she looks. I was going to say I think she looks
00:42:14 pretty good for her age like like you like you thought that that picture of her and her kids
00:42:18 was like her dad and her siblings. Right. Well I hadn't like looked at her. She's 56 years old.
00:42:25 So yeah she looks. She's pretty good. She looks pretty good. 56 yeah. Not that it really matters
00:42:30 for anything but you know it really doesn't. These fucking pictures are hilarious though.
00:42:39 I'm sure they will all scroll in. I'm scrolling. One of them looks like she's about to sneeze.
00:42:45 Oh we got we got an imposter. We got a fake.
00:42:51 Fake Kamala Harris. There she is. It's proof. She's wearing someone else's skin. What do you mean?
00:42:56 What do you mean fake? Fake what? Fake body? Fake face. Fake face. It's her face on someone
00:43:03 else's body. They swapped her. They pulled the switcheroo. That's makeup. That's just
00:43:08 what? What are they circling? I don't know what they're circling. Scooby-Doo.
00:43:13 I really yeah I don't. It seems like it feels like they just took a photo and then drew circles on.
00:43:19 But I think it is makeup. Yeah. Of course it's makeup. It wouldn't actually be a skin thing. Face.
00:43:28 Stop trying to cover it up. Stop trying to cover it up. Stop shilling for mainstream media.
00:43:35 Stop trying to cover it up like people try to cover up your mouth with the COVID
00:43:39 masks that are fake and it's all fake. Stop trying to cover it up like you want all of our all of
00:43:45 our white women to cover up with the uh with the uh oh what's the with the hijab you fucking Marxist.
00:43:54 Yeah. Is that what people are thinking? You haven't seen the like the meme that's like oh 2020
00:44:00 everyone has to wear a mask 2021. Like forced feminization. Everyone will like everyone will
00:44:06 no no it's forced Islamization. Everyone will have to wear the hijab.
00:44:10 Yeah that's where that's where it's going. That's where it's going.
00:44:14 Soon. Or wait is the hijab the head wrap or which one's like the full body? It's like
00:44:21 it's like it's gonna progress. It's gonna progress. The burqa is the full body. Yeah.
00:44:25 Yeah it's mask 2020 2021 hijab 2022 burqa. It's it's interesting that like this kind of stuff
00:44:33 globalism progresses to where people will say things like like the fact that we make it okay
00:44:40 for people to choose what they want to do somehow translates to people are going to be forced to
00:44:45 do X like yeah like I mean it's it's been like that with uh I mean I guess I guess if people are
00:44:52 really saying this about the hijab like do people think that? I mean I'm sure some people I'm sure
00:44:58 fucking like you believers yeah I think it would be like gay marriage stuff like that yeah yeah like
00:45:05 people would make it up as a meme and then like an old guy being like oh look what I saw on 4chan
00:45:11 oh it's true they're gonna do it they're gonna do it yeah they did it with like gay marriage they
00:45:18 said like oh well if we legalize it it'll normalize it and everyone will turn gay come out and they
00:45:24 do it with trans people too yeah it's like oh well you know they're they're gonna they're if we make
00:45:30 you know if we normalize it they're gonna give all our kids hormones whatever they're gonna there's
00:45:34 a lot of using kids to um to pretend like they're looking out for yeah they're looking out for people's
00:45:41 uh well that's how that's how it is that's how it is with everything like this it's like oh well
00:45:45 it's a it's a slippery slope they just know what it actually thinks they find things to be gross
00:45:50 yeah it is I mean don't expose our kids it's it's child it's child abuse to uh to have a kids
00:45:56 watch Steven Universe and see a lesbian marriage because then they're gonna grow up thinking that's
00:46:01 okay I mean do you turn them gay do people really think that like you know people are going to um
00:46:10 like performs like like there's gonna be surgery done on like five-year-olds like they know I think
00:46:17 as long as somebody doesn't see critically at all no that's not how it works like it seems like
00:46:21 that's a pretty easy fix well that that's that's the scare that's the scare uh and it doesn't
00:46:26 it doesn't matter that it doesn't really happen when people like hear about something and they
00:46:31 find it scary they'll they'll you know it'll their imagination will run away with them and they
00:46:37 won't think critically and they'll just keep that fact quote unquote in their head and whenever it
00:46:42 comes up again they'll be like oh but did you know they're gonna this is gonna lead to like
00:46:47 they're gonna do surgery on babies and it's just not right and it's like they have nothing they
00:46:52 have not thought about it for even one second well there's people who think that's already
00:46:56 happened the fear keeps it locked in there it's not even I mean there's that it's gonna happen that
00:47:00 it's already happening you because that's what they think puberty blockers are you can find reports
00:47:06 you can find reports of like that's like seem to corrupt I mean you can find evidence that
00:47:11 seems to corroborate like any any crazy position you want to take like there are like there are
00:47:16 stories there are horror stories of like oh you know some some therapist with an agenda like you
00:47:22 know brainwashed my kid into thinking he's a girl now or something and or like oh they want to give
00:47:27 they want to give my kid fucking like hormone therapy when they're like two years old and like
00:47:32 I don't know I think generally those are like either extreme outlier cases or like you know
00:47:37 the truth has been spun a little bit and if you dig in it's like it's really not as it's really
00:47:42 not as black and white as maybe the headline made it sound I see that all the time yeah I mean what
00:47:46 I mean by what I said is like the fringe cases will will let people assume that it is the only
00:47:53 thing that's happening and that it's always happening and then there's no there's no like
00:47:58 nuance to it if it's scary it's all scary all the way if there's no there's no chance that it could
00:48:03 be somewhat okay if it's scary and you don't like it you can always find evidence to point to
00:48:10 and be like look look this happened somewhere and you know this is this is what they want to do this
00:48:15 is what the the whatever the left or something wants uh uh the globalists who you can you
00:48:24 find evidence to uh uh bolster any any position any arbitrarily chosen position you you might have
00:48:31 if you want get a look at the data you're gonna follow the data so I said about circumcision show
00:48:37 me the data Ben you could have just seen the data by now I know people have mentioned but I didn't
00:48:43 you've you've had weeks and weeks I just don't care that much it's just I don't I don't understand
00:48:49 why we keep getting circumcision voicemails what are you talking about I don't think it's a big deal
00:48:55 I don't think it's that big a deal I'm not that interested in it but people seem to get
00:48:59 people seem pretty invested in it oh like the the whether you should circumcise babies
00:49:05 yeah okay oh I've we we've literally had this conversation before you and me I have I have I
00:49:11 think I have come off I have come off more pro circumcision in my arguments than I think I really
00:49:17 am I I'm not like really like strongly like pro we should do it don't do it don't and I would say
00:49:25 I would I would I would agree with what you said last time Gib I think it was you about like
00:49:31 you know if if there's no like need for it it's probably best to default to not doing it
00:49:38 yeah or give or give the kid the choice give the kid the choice if if possible I think I think
00:49:43 that's probably like if I was born with a penis and I had been circumcised I don't know other people
00:49:50 feel different but I would be pissed I would be mad but not everyone feels that way well I mean
00:49:56 but why I mean why would you be pissed if it didn't cause you any problems oh I just think
00:50:00 it's cool why why would like it just seems like a weird thing for someone else to decide for you
00:50:07 yeah exactly I'll give you I'll give you I'll agree with that we should we should have a surgery
00:50:12 to add extra for skin yeah like why would you default to taking an action specifically to remove
00:50:18 something rather than just let it be and then yeah take the action later I don't know I mean
00:50:25 I mean we should do every surgery you can on a baby you would make it like as strong as possible
00:50:30 there would need to be like I don't know if like um if there were like a really high incidence of
00:50:37 like I don't know some kind of medical problem happening in lots of people if like you didn't
00:50:42 circumcise babies I'd be like maybe it's for the best if we circumcise their babies it doesn't
00:50:46 really it doesn't really seem to be the case though so dude what if what if you could do a
00:50:51 surgery at a baby that would like make them not like die of old age like that's the biggest killer
00:51:01 do you that'd be pretty sick actually do you think do you think people will be like ah that's not
00:51:05 fair I'm gonna die in this baby give them a choice yeah no like what if they what if they want to
00:51:12 die like I want to die says the person who's going to die oh you mean like they just even
00:51:18 though it's like just an objectively good thing people would say no don't do it because it's not
00:51:22 fair because like I didn't get the chance yeah no that's where I was going to go with it it's like
00:51:25 well I didn't get the surgery so you know I'm gonna be better about it and not give my kid the surgery
00:51:33 hmm uh I I would I mean I would be better about it yeah but I mean I have no argument
00:51:40 I haven't I have no argument against you oh yeah Ben you fear death more than anyone that I know
00:51:47 nice nice oh pussy that's a great that's a great that's a great uh uh uh distinction
00:51:55 to have I'm proud I'm proud to wear that it's a nice little tidbit that Ben is the most death
00:52:00 fearing like the superlatives most likely to thank you sad when he died most likely to be
00:52:07 said I will most likely to be said in the grave I'll be down it's like darn I'll be down there
00:52:16 like punch the tail we'll shit fuck I can't believe this happened how could I have been so foolish
00:52:23 as to die it's fucked up man you know we should do it's fucked up we should talk about um art
00:52:33 stuff we should talk about art shit because we're art people yeah this is for art this is art podcast
00:52:38 Kazi you're art you're an artist what is your art inspiration what do you you draw you've been
00:52:45 you've been recently I say recently but like for a while now I've been getting into a more of a
00:52:51 a child child ish drawing esque sort of way of drawing that's really cool yeah free and like
00:52:59 unrestricted mmm then how to describe exactly um little little space yeah the word is that you're
00:53:05 looking for you're like noggin core like like you know nick jr noggin that shit noggin super noggin
00:53:11 core um yeah um I don't know I I just am drawn to that style of work I don't know I I mean I I've
00:53:21 had people say that my work looks like I don't know different from shit that they've seen
00:53:28 but I really think it's just a matter of perspective because I mean like I don't know
00:53:32 I I am ripping plenty of people off as all good artists do I think I'm just ripping off a
00:53:38 different pool of artists than people normally look at that's perfect that's exactly how to become
00:53:46 someone who everybody thinks is good is that either they haven't seen what you're ripping
00:53:52 off or you're ripping off so many things that it no longer looks like anything else
00:53:56 yeah I think I finally I've made it to that point in my career where like I was ripping off
00:54:01 just like I was always ripping somebody off at every given time until I couldn't tell who I was
00:54:07 ripping off anymore now I'm like oh I must just be ripping off myself is that for like music or
00:54:13 videos or everything mostly videos or just writing in general um yeah for sure I mean I am I'm
00:54:21 strongly of the belief that to be a good artist you need to study good artists intensely
00:54:30 I think that you really need to look at some masterful work and really break it down and just
00:54:35 hard it's hard to look at it intensely wait why it's hard I just I like I look at things I love
00:54:42 and I'm like oh this is so good I enjoy watching or reading this this thing and then to study
00:54:49 intensely to understand it is like I gotta go back and look closer zoom in like what are they doing
00:54:55 bore this isn't the same as watching or reading the thing um I I don't I don't like look at a lot
00:55:00 of art but like I do if I see something that is very striking I do like to like look and be like
00:55:06 oh how'd they do that oh like what's the what try and try and like reverse engineer what the technique
00:55:11 was no I think I definitely don't do enough of stuff like that I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm stagnating in
00:55:17 my art skill it's hard it's hard yummy too it's hard to differentiate between the art that you like
00:55:23 to look at and the art that you like to make um I don't know if you guys have done this before but
00:55:30 I've had points where I will look at an artist and be like oh like I really love their stuff and I
00:55:34 really like to look at it and so like I want to make stuff that is more like this and then when I
00:55:40 try to um try to do that it it doesn't feel right it doesn't yeah I'm not inclined to do it that way
00:55:48 and so you I don't know it's a hard thing to to navigate and to figure out like what
00:55:54 do I actually like to do rather than what do I like to look at
00:56:00 that's yeah like sometimes like I will draw something like this and I will be very happy
00:56:07 with it even though it's like extremely low quality yet like low effort but like
00:56:13 you know there's not a lot of thought put into where things go it just sort of feels right
00:56:18 and then I think and then I think of like all of the other things I want to do and that
00:56:23 they don't look like this they look like other artists they like and they're better than me
00:56:28 and I'm like I don't know how to I tried to I tried to doodle something I tried like I just
00:56:34 like was like I haven't drawn anything in a while I'm gonna just draw something and I like
00:56:39 put down a piece of paper and I picked up a pen I was like okay here we go and I like drew a face
00:56:44 and I put a hat on it and I was like I hate this this is the worst thing I've ever done
00:56:48 how do people how do people do this and I ripped it up and I went to sleep that's a classic tale
00:56:53 that's a classic artist's tale thank you it's all this time yes um I mean with with Gib like
00:57:02 I don't know I guess something that I've been unlearning is I've been going through
00:57:07 college because I go to school for illustration right now and I'm in my senior year is like
00:57:12 I like basically learning all of the the fundamentals and stuff so that I can undo them
00:57:21 and I'm sort of like I mean I was I was going through sort of a phase in early college where
00:57:28 I was trying to use these techniques and you know anatomy and stuff like that and like
00:57:37 I think I don't I don't really know if you have to have a strong understanding of the fundamentals
00:57:43 to like get to this point but I think for a lot of people and for me it's sort of like you learn
00:57:49 how to do things properly and then you you sort of undo that like I'm very much going towards
00:57:58 a simplified like very scribbly sort of style and like the stuff you draw looks very easy to do
00:58:10 to an untrained eye but like it's it's it's clear that there's a lot of skill that goes into deciding
00:58:16 how exactly to draw the script you know I've um so doing the doing the like um art on like the
00:58:24 inside doodles for the vapors I've been using Copics which is a lot like watercolor basically
00:58:31 so I've been actually like doing color which is weird for me but it's fun and I like it and I found
00:58:37 this that is good at colors you should do it it comes out kind of good it actually comes out
00:58:43 kind of good sometimes I'm like oh wow thank you um I like yeah I like it and I found this
00:58:49 artist on Twitter they're called corn um Magna Galina as they're at and they do like fairly
00:58:58 elaborate not not like super elaborate like at their cartoony but they do um watercolor or Copic
00:59:03 or something art and I sometimes they will post like a little like work in progress shots where
00:59:09 they'll have like they'll have the line work and then they'll show like just the shading
00:59:14 like what they do is like they they go in with like a light color and they shade in like the
00:59:18 shaded parts and then they color over it and like the shading like kind of carries over into the
00:59:24 final I think it's really cool to look at those sometimes the ones with just shading kind of
00:59:29 have their own kind of cool like they're very mono color and like and and I don't know they're
00:59:35 nice in their own way and so I've been I don't know I've been uh interested in that kind of thing
00:59:41 oh I'm looking at some right now uh uh uh let me find let me find a good one no that would
00:59:48 sucks I think they're all sometimes I just I don't have enough of um the the sort of
00:59:57 constant artist drive to improve that I need in order to improve correctly like I I don't know
01:00:05 like a lot of the time it just goes like I I don't care about all of this stuff for a very long time
01:00:15 and um I'm paying for it because I'm not improving and that's just it sucks
01:00:23 I think you are by default improving I've got all of these like like fucking anatomy books
01:00:30 uh like out on tabs and I'm looking through and I don't care I just like I leaves too easily I mean
01:00:37 like personally I don't necessarily get better by way of like necessarily practicing if I'm already
01:00:45 as good as I can be at what I'm doing it's like you gotta learn something new to want to do you
01:00:49 know like yeah like it's not a matter of like linearly improving in the direction you're going
01:00:55 so much as like okay well what can I add to this now so I think you might need to find something
01:01:00 that you want to imitate again like something that newly makes you think like oh well fuck
01:01:05 if I could incorporate some of that in here like that would be perfect you know maybe you need to
01:01:11 be doing more searching than practicing I heard this advice somewhere I don't remember where it
01:01:16 might have been a professor that said it to me but um it was it was like I think the a lot of the
01:01:23 moments where you sort of make these breakthroughs with your work are usually when you're just fucking
01:01:29 around and not when you're like consciously trying to do something yeah like if you're trying to like
01:01:35 I'm going to sit down and practice or I'm going to do this rather than just um I'm like I mean as
01:01:43 though like like practice is important but I mean those moments when you're sort of like when something
01:01:50 just happens when you just sort of make something and you're not really intending to um those are
01:01:54 a lot of moments where I've this is like oh I can do this it's like that John Cleese thing again
01:02:01 sort of reminds me of the John Cleese uh creativity lecture yeah it's about playing yeah
01:02:07 oh I've never seen that I mean I the other day it's really good the other day I randomly was
01:02:12 drawing and I came up with this and I think this is like pretty good compared to what I usually do
01:02:16 doodle I like yeah I love this the shadow on the underside of the hair looks really good
01:02:22 and it's like how cool but uh I I don't know it it's frustrating that I just can't keep
01:02:31 it like yeah it happens by these things happen by accident they happen by accident and they don't
01:02:36 stick around and I'm like I don't know I know that like the upward the the more you do stuff
01:02:43 it doesn't really matter whether you're doing it right as much as you know just continually doing
01:02:48 it the upward trend quality of your work will increase over time um so like the like I wouldn't
01:02:55 have been able to do this a couple of years ago um casually because I since then I learned
01:03:01 little bits here and there but like I don't know there's there's always this pressure because I see
01:03:06 good art all the time I'm always looking at Instagram and Twitter and it's like great art just by
01:03:13 people and it's you know I know not to compare myself to them but there's this underlying
01:03:19 sort of pressure that like if I practice more rigorously or or like just do more drawing generally
01:03:30 more often than like this would improve better and faster and I don't know I I mean I I've been
01:03:38 in the same position it's really hard to not compare yourself I think I've gotten I don't know
01:03:45 if I would say as good as I can be at it but I I've gotten pretty good at developing a mentality
01:03:52 where I look at art that I really like and go this is fucking amazing I can't do this right now but
01:03:59 like I can see a path to getting there and that's really motivating to think of it that way and I
01:04:05 I don't know because I know for a lot of people it's hard you you can't just sort of snap your
01:04:09 fingers and have that mentality about it but if you can try to get yourself to a place where you're
01:04:14 looking at someone that you really look up to and you say you know I like I can do that I can see
01:04:21 a way to getting there for me honestly I've kind of left the mentality that like I have any control
01:04:27 over what I'm going to create like I just see it as like it's one thing to fantasize about like I'm
01:04:34 going to go in this direction I'm going to like my art's going to end up like this but like it's
01:04:38 just not like it's going to end up being whatever it ends up being by way of like you can push it
01:04:43 in a way you want it to go but like you can't predict what your hand is actually going to do
01:04:48 like with by thinking about it you know so it's just like at the end of the day I've kind of given
01:04:54 up on trying to like scheme out like okay here's my path forward or like I'm gonna do this kind of
01:04:59 thing and this kind of thing I'm just like I'm just gonna do whatever it happens that I end up wanting
01:05:03 to do when I happen to want to do it and hope it works out somehow what about my plans plans
01:05:12 the best laid plans of mice and men are always shitty gay garbage that's what the sense right
01:05:19 I read I love that book uh they my problem my problem is uh is a motivation uh I think I feel
01:05:30 like I could do anything yeah but I just don't I don't want to I'm more along those lines there's
01:05:35 nothing there's nothing that I actually want to do well I've learned I mean there's there's some
01:05:40 I've there's some things that are fun to do most of them are drugs and the main reason to work is to
01:05:45 have money so you can buy them um I I I I don't know I feel like I don't know I can look at this
01:05:57 like this this artist is really good and I feel like I can see kind of how he does this thing and
01:06:01 like if I were like man I really want I really feel like drawing a picture of fucking Gabriel
01:06:09 with some skulls and some and a chalice and a sword and a cross and some scale I could be like
01:06:15 fuck yeah and then I could put some work in and it would take me a while but I could plan it out
01:06:20 put it in uh do this like I know how to do all this stuff it none of this looks like impossible
01:06:25 to me but it's like why what what would possibly possess me yeah of the desire to do that's more
01:06:31 the way I have tend to find myself it's like I look at things and I'm like okay I see how this
01:06:35 could happen but like they already did it like yeah do I need to do this or it is like do I just
01:06:43 what like can I I guess on some level it's like experiencing the ego death of just like being happy
01:06:49 that it exists and not like and not feeling like I had to be involved you know like like sometimes
01:06:54 you see something you like and you feel like oh I have to find some way to replicate this so I can
01:06:58 like show that I get it you know but it's like oh you don't have to like that person got it they
01:07:02 made it you know right yeah I feel like there's I don't know the the um because you post things
01:07:12 online and the whole world everyone in the world is watching that you know the the career of of
01:07:19 Gibb and take what is what is it what are they gonna do next um and I feel like I don't know if if
01:07:25 if it turns out that I'm only doing this to perpetuate what I've already been doing and I
01:07:29 don't actually care about doing it that would suck you know so I feel like I gotta like oh I
01:07:35 want to improve it out and I want to make comics because I said that I want to make comics and
01:07:39 want to improve art many times and so it feels like it's it's written in stone and I'm just
01:07:45 that's where you're continuing to do it that's where your compulsion is taking you and follow it
01:07:50 always follow it I mean it's just it's just hard to know because like I've been taking a break for a
01:07:55 while and I was just getting back into it like yeah maybe yeah I've been just kind of like
01:08:02 nickel and diming my way around making stuff like not really committing myself to trying to make
01:08:08 something with a lot of intentionality but just like letting things like I have a documentary
01:08:13 I'm gonna edit that's like I just took two weeks around the US and filmed whatever happened you
01:08:19 know so it's like that kind of incidental work it's more appealing to me now where you just kind of
01:08:24 look at it in the editing bay and say well what can I make this into as opposed to like going in with
01:08:29 a plan you know I I'm a little fucked uh my tablet not my tablet my my cintiq broke oh shit really
01:08:42 there is a thing that I yeah like it still works but like the screen yeah it does but the screen is
01:08:49 just black and I don't know I'm yeah so like without the screen uh a couple years okay um it's
01:08:58 like it's not that because mine's a couple years old too and I'm like I'm really it's a big investment
01:09:03 I really don't want to have to replace it it still works except at the screen except the screen just
01:09:10 doesn't show anything the screen is black so I'm hoping that maybe if I can bring it to some kind of
01:09:14 like repair shop or something they'll like there's something they can do about it and I have no idea
01:09:20 uh if that's true or not I will just have to uh uh see but like there yeah there is um after the
01:09:31 after all the vapor's kickstarter stuff there is some stuff I was gonna start working on but um
01:09:36 it I really I really don't want to draw it with a mouse I don't want to do that so
01:09:42 would you be able to use um the tablet without a screen because I can't I can't do it uh no
01:09:50 yeah I can like I used to use I had a lock on bamboo that I use like 50 bucks on ebay and like I
01:09:57 use that for years and years and years um and uh only like relative only like in the last like
01:10:04 maybe two years or so did I switch to the cintiq and I did come to like it and now that I don't
01:10:10 have it I'm like yeah fuck but I now use I use the bamboo forever I I bought a bamboo when I was
01:10:18 like 12 because I wanted to draw um warrior cats fan art on I want to draw on the computer um
01:10:25 and I could not do it I did not have the hand-eye coordination to do it and I to this very day I'm
01:10:32 still a little bit perplexed at people that can do it so well I can only barely I mean it's just
01:10:39 you just gotta you just like learn and it's just about like muscle memory to like know
01:10:44 where the where your hand will go and where the mouse will go it I don't know I feel like there's
01:10:49 just something that I just can't but that's just not clicking with me I mean I used a um I used
01:10:57 like an iPad to draw in my teenage years for digital and um when I was 16 I got the cintiq
01:11:05 that I still use today and it's my favorite thing that I have ever owned and I was just like
01:11:11 yeah I need to get this because if I don't then I have no other way of making digital art
01:11:16 Cassie can you type while not looking at the keyboard um
01:11:24 kind of a little bit um I never learned how to type properly I type I don't type the way you're
01:11:32 supposed to but I can type like at a normal speed what with your fingers on home row no yeah no I
01:11:37 does anybody type does anybody type like they tried to teach me and I didn't like it was too late
01:11:42 for me like I had already taught myself to just home row the home row is when you have your your
01:11:47 fingers on the ASD and the Jkl and like you know it's like oh to hit F you use your index finger
01:11:55 from the D and then to hit I it's your middle finger from the K and and you know yeah I don't
01:12:00 formula I don't know how to do that anybody does that I have my own system and I know people
01:12:05 who didn't learn that way and they do type way faster surely I well I didn't I thought everyone
01:12:13 did it that way I don't know I assumed that I was one of you who like didn't learn how to type right
01:12:19 they tried to teach me yeah I mostly default to having like my fingers on um AWD because of
01:12:26 video games they'll be watched yeah and then from there I can type lots real quick but I actually
01:12:33 don't know that I look at the keyboard when I type now that I think about I like glance down in it
01:12:39 I like mostly use muscle memory but like I do look down at it so I'm like half and half uh
01:12:45 what are we talking about talking about tablets tablets I'm just still scrolling through
01:12:51 magna galina's feed he's so good yeah I wasn't sure what you meant when you're talking about the
01:12:56 shadows um but when you posted this yeah these two like but you see yeah no I see now what you're
01:13:01 talking about yeah was that like a physical drawing or yeah it's water yeah oh cool yeah water color
01:13:10 water color for the yeah it's cool there's a oh man I just I just passed one I just passed a really
01:13:18 good one uh I'm gonna make you watch it I'm gonna make you look at this one where was it oh oh oh
01:13:28 oh yeah here we go yeah here we go watercolors watercolors are so fucking cool they are I'm
01:13:38 in a watercolor color class right now I'm watching it there was a there was a better one before where
01:13:45 like he starts in from scratch and like he's putting the shadow layer down over like the eyes uh
01:13:52 I don't know it's cool it's cool how like watercolor is like you like you put down the color
01:13:59 but like that's not it's not done you you have to like kind of like pull it and push it around
01:14:04 with the brush yeah it's it's it's water bending is what it is it is yeah yeah yeah it's like you
01:14:11 look at it and you're like I think my my instinct is like oh my god they're so like that's so scary
01:14:17 right like they're putting the brush down and like what if they what if they fuck it up like if they
01:14:22 fuck it up the drawing is ruined but no no no that's the trick that's what that's what the that's the
01:14:27 mind game you gotta be bold in fact yeah you be bold and if it works it looks great and if it
01:14:34 doesn't work you can push and pull it around no if it doesn't work you get and it'll be okay
01:14:39 if you really fuck it up um we had uh yeah if you if you're not bold you don't get anything
01:14:45 in my watercolor class we had um an artist come in to talk with us um he does a lot of
01:14:51 paintings of of boston he's local and um he showed us um sort of a time lapse video of
01:14:58 him doing some paintings and like I mean he he has like a you know a rough sketch underneath
01:15:03 and then he just sort of puts a wash of color over the whole thing and just like blocks in
01:15:07 these huge shapes um and I I feel like I don't know I'm trying to get over that um being like oh
01:15:14 but what if you know there's like a little part that I want to have in front of this part like
01:15:18 what if I ruin it by putting this big block of color down because you can't go over dark parts
01:15:23 with white parts yeah I don't know the way he did it it's very much like you you need to just be
01:15:32 confident just put that shit down yeah slap it on there yeah the art advice I keep giving getting
01:15:41 given is just like just draw sure lines stop trying to go back over your lines oh yeah everything's
01:15:47 gotta be done sure yeah it's the same it's the same idea if you do like bold lines then you get
01:15:53 then you get bold results and it and it looks more striking if you pet your lines in you just
01:15:59 look like a fucking cow I don't know yeah soft weak same with watercolor like it looks so good
01:16:06 when you're doing watercolor and you have like a section where you just have like one bold brush stroke
01:16:11 and it works yeah that's what it's like it's really impactful yeah well you know it kind of yeah it
01:16:16 kind of ties me into something I was saying um I don't remember if this is in pcp chat or where
01:16:21 earlier about how like I'm trying to think less in general as a human being because I don't think
01:16:27 that people make good decisions necessarily by thinking about them I think usually people just
01:16:32 know like like if they're if they're capable of making a good decision they will know relatively
01:16:39 quickly and it won't take that much thought like if you have to think about something a whole lot
01:16:44 you're probably not even fit to be like thinking about it you know what I mean you mean yeah I
01:16:50 think I know what you mean like like if I have to if I have to like finically like do my lines
01:16:55 it's because I'm like I don't know what I'm doing I don't like you know maybe I will eventually
01:17:01 do practice of doing this over and over again but like ultimately the way I will get good at drawing
01:17:05 lines is not by practicing about them shitty lines until they're good it's by just keep keep
01:17:12 trying to make good lines until you can do it you know like shitty lines don't build to good lines
01:17:18 is what I'm trying to say you have to be trying to make good lines and failing not like making
01:17:23 shittier lines on purpose I guess so it's like that's true so I think that applies to a lot of
01:17:28 different aspects of learning where it's like if if like when I write write a video I don't think
01:17:35 about it I just like have a general idea of what it's going to be about and like probably the first
01:17:40 sentence and then I just write it you know it just comes out of me and like it used to take
01:17:45 more thinking but now it takes less thinking and it's getting better but requiring less thinking
01:17:50 because it's just something I've practiced so much that like it is second nature it doesn't
01:17:55 take thought you know and like I think that's the ideal state you want to be in as a human
01:17:59 is that nothing you're doing takes thought at all like you you're just confident that you know what
01:18:04 you're doing and you just do it you know for sure there's a lot of value in having confidence in
01:18:10 general that's where I want to be there's a lot of value I think in having I mean if you're a visual
01:18:15 artist um a sketchbook that you know that you will never show anyone that's shit it can be like a
01:18:21 stack of printer paper and just like bang out really crappy drawings like in pen oh yeah all over
01:18:28 I do that all the time with like I don't know I'm I'm in a call and I'm just sort of fucking around
01:18:34 I open a photoshop document and I just draw in some crap that I will never show anyone unless
01:18:40 there's something funny and I'll post it just bang out like 51 minute sketches on a big page yeah
01:18:46 and then trash it like that's helpful um I haven't I've been doing a lot of digital stuff um
01:18:54 but you know I'm I'm recently getting back into some traditional art with the with the
01:18:59 watercolor and even back into um oil painting and I'm working on a project I don't think I
01:19:05 I should can say what it is yet but I'm very excited because um there's a guy it's really cool
01:19:14 he worked on homestuck stuff and I'm working with him on an orc it's not Andrew Hussie
01:19:22 and that's almost done I'm just doing the last bit of it can you not say the guy he didn't tell
01:19:28 me not to but I don't know but I mean like it it it might be like up by the time this episode is up
01:19:34 anyway so like you know um but the oil painting what'd you say look at these colors
01:19:45 look at these fucking colors I'm gonna die I'm gonna die just thinking about them
01:19:51 I like that pink that pink armor I like the blue like the shaggy body on that guy with the red head
01:19:58 yeah the all of those colors they're just really good mix with each other Greg's Greg's no Wayne's
01:20:04 cheekbones the yellow guy there's something about physical media it's just there's there's something
01:20:14 about media you can have it can if you do it if you lean into it it can bestow a certain texture
01:20:24 work that you just can't get with a brush yeah absolutely I mean this this oil painting that
01:20:29 I'm doing I'm I'm I find you've seen I named my oil paintings before um there's a painter named
01:20:34 Wayne Tebow you spell his last name thiebaud I think he's like fucking old the shit he's like
01:20:41 turning 100 um okay but he's really inspired how I go about painting um by like really packing on
01:20:51 the paint and using um the palette knife instead of a brush no not gouache yeah yeah yeah okay yeah
01:20:59 and just like really packing on the paint and it's just having it be really thick and sort of um
01:21:05 it's it's like it's like frosting a cake instead of painting a painting is what it feels like
01:21:09 it's like you're sculpting with the paint um that's what I'm doing for this project and it's really fun
01:21:15 hmm how do you decide what you want to paint or draw that's that's where I get that's where
01:21:21 I'm hung up if I if I was like if I had I feel like if I just had like boy I know exactly
01:21:29 what I want to like draw here I could it could it would be a masterpiece we tried drawing without
01:21:35 thinking about it beforehand and just see what happened yeah that's what I did I did I spent
01:21:39 five minutes doodling a face the other day and I was like no I'll never draw again this is a mistake
01:21:44 well I mean that's your problem I think you know that's your problem is that you stop yeah maybe
01:21:50 I mean it's like what did you said just um sort of banging shit out until you until it sticks I
01:21:58 guess I don't know but I also struggle with that like like knowing what like techniques I want to
01:22:08 use and like what colors I want to use and stuff but not having like a clear idea of what
01:22:12 it is that I want to make um yeah I've been there a bunch I guess I would just say doodle until
01:22:21 you come up until you're like oh I want to expand on this and I hate I hate doodling it's so embarrassing
01:22:28 embarrassing it's so yeah it's so embarrassing to like draw something and look at it and be like
01:22:35 what's the fan what's the point what's the point that's amazing that you can be embarrassed by your
01:22:39 own judgment yeah well I am easily easily fair enough uh yeah well you know it's it's just like
01:22:53 you you have in your head something that you you imagine when you start doodling usually
01:23:00 like you start drawing a figure and you're like I wonder if they're gonna be like posing like this
01:23:04 and you think of things like that then you look at what you're doing and it sucks yeah because it's
01:23:09 a doodle and you weren't really trying it makes me angry not so much embarrassed it's just angry
01:23:16 that's one of the stages is fury is white hot rage
01:23:23 yeah I mean I don't get angry quite so much anymore I just sort of like
01:23:27 I don't think I don't feel anything I'm just like drawing on like that sucks I haven't felt
01:23:33 that sense of like blockage only because of the fact that I again have not been holding myself
01:23:38 accountable to to do anything lately because I don't want to feel that blockage of like if I find
01:23:44 myself in a position where like nothing is coming out then my my stance was just do something else
01:23:51 like because otherwise I'm just gonna wallow in it like if I wallow in a feeling for more than five
01:23:56 minutes it's definitely a waste of time and I should definitely go do something else so like
01:24:01 you know if it that means I don't end up making anything for a while then it just means nothing
01:24:06 was going to be made you know I know the best thing is is to have characters that are so simple
01:24:15 that doodling them is you know you don't have to do very much for it to be correct
01:24:21 value such as a red man and yeah like there's a good way so just some stupid shit like this
01:24:29 where it's just like I'm just drawing a circle now it's red man he's talking about himself
01:24:36 Gib you have like the best character designs and like I just want like Gib I just want you
01:24:45 to like do these like funny like stupid little doodles that are you just like banging out really
01:24:51 fast and they're just like I don't know your stuff is hilarious I want you to like just make like a
01:24:56 book just of like drawings of this over and over again thankfully game that's what I wanted from
01:25:00 you I love that shit that's twitter well it was at least you were doing a lot of these on twitter
01:25:05 for a while uh yeah like the red man comics and an occasional doodle of things yeah I could maybe
01:25:12 I mean right now I'm working on making uh the bell shape book in in style of of like the the
01:25:20 homestuck books where they take the things and they take all of the good parts out of it as it you
01:25:26 know bees is it's like it's gifts it's animations it's stuff um and then ruin it by putting it on
01:25:33 paper and that's what I'm doing and so I want I want that to be fun that that's kind of fun in it in
01:25:39 like an art way in itself just figuring out how to lay out all these pages and making it look
01:25:44 professional and being like yeah these these terrible terrible drawings that were never meant
01:25:50 to be anything I am putting into like a book that's almost a joke in and of itself no it's awesome
01:25:57 but yeah I could definitely do another book of like just stupid doodle things I like yeah I like
01:26:05 physical media I like I like printing I like printing shitty ms paint drawings I think a book
01:26:11 of like really like stuff like particularly this red man one um would be a great like coffee table
01:26:16 book just like have on your table that people flip it open it's just ridiculous shit like what the
01:26:21 yeah that's what I was like it would be a great time I want that shit hardcover
01:26:28 or I mean even like I don't know I uh I had this I had a goal for a while that I did not
01:26:35 accomplish until recently which was um fill up an entire sketchbook with drawings that I think
01:26:40 look good scan the whole thing and put it on gumroad and I finally did it and it's great and I
01:26:47 I feel like you could do something like that um yeah that could be doable yeah I've gotten good
01:26:54 response from the gumroad book and I'm really happy and I'm gonna do another one that's quite easy
01:27:00 I know drawing's hard no no no like it's quite easy to just like scan it and put it up I mean
01:27:06 and then just like oh sure right as a like a pdf yeah just a pdf and every once in a while it's like
01:27:11 oh someone bought your thing just you know some some little passive how much is it um it's it's
01:27:18 minimum three bucks and um but a lot of people have been tipping very generously which I'm very
01:27:25 thankful for mm whales yeah yeah sims um I don't know I just figured it would be a good idea to be
01:27:37 like look it's like almost no money so you know yeah yeah you can't afford not to do it I bought I bought
01:27:45 um I should go buy it I bought I bought uh I bought the Six Tens album the other day
01:27:52 mm was it songs for songs for nice guys for nice guys beats for nice guys what a great
01:27:59 I bought it I haven't listened to it yet it's a great album well you did you could you two
01:28:03 both did like cover art right yeah I did yeah yeah yeah I didn't LaMau yeah and Anthony did
01:28:13 went to the art munchie um did one as well that's that's right um forgot forgot about that yeah it
01:28:19 was great I did I was like oh I'm gonna try you know sticking with the physical media kick I'm
01:28:25 just like I'm gonna do colored pencil and I did and I was like this looks great and then I scanned
01:28:30 it and I looked at it on my screen it looked like shit so I did a lot of editing in Photoshop
01:28:35 mm what did just the scan like didn't like read it well or I don't know something about
01:28:43 what was it on the screen there was just some areas that looked like I don't I don't explain
01:28:49 there was just areas that needed a lot of touching up um probably unnecessarily I think there's a lot
01:28:55 of um I don't know I do this as an artist I don't know if you guys do but there's a lot of
01:29:01 moments where you're looking at something you've made and you're like oh I gotta fix this
01:29:05 fucking thing it looks stupid and like you fix it and you notice the difference but no one else
01:29:11 would like you're just wasting your time yep truthfully I do that way too much like there's a
01:29:16 pixel out of out of the way like I should I should delete that pixel that's the wrong pixel
01:29:21 that wasn't intended by me the artist mm-hmm yeah and there and therefore therefore it is a problem
01:29:35 oh dang I didn't intend for this watercolor stroke to like blend with the other color and
01:29:41 like create a gradient like oh fuck I gotta delete it it's ruined that's the good shit when it blends
01:29:48 yeah yeah when when it that that face when it that face wait wait wait here we go this is this is
01:29:56 this is mfw it blends whoa that's what I look like good face good blend good good look good look
01:30:07 oh man fuck alright it's for losers well all right
01:30:13 yeah do we have do we want to go to voicemails then
01:30:19 how we've been good what oh we've been going for almost two hours haven't we
01:30:22 an hour and a half yeah okay yeah um kazzie you want to stick around for voicemails yeah sure
01:30:29 I forgot about those okay we do them there's there's there's like an average amount uh today
01:30:36 uh let me see how much is an average amount like seven maybe 20 oh we get a lot I had
01:30:46 there was one day where munchie we wrap it we wrap it fire him he was in charge of picking
01:30:50 which ones went on the show and so we were listening to them together so you had a dream
01:30:56 wait did you say you had a dream no not a dream it was not a dream it was it was real and it was
01:31:01 it was that munchie was in charge of picking the voicemails for an episode and so we listened to
01:31:07 all of them and I could not believe the level of quality how fucking bad they all were like the
01:31:14 ones that got in wait just like okay but the ones that don't get it on the pcp yeah wait oh that
01:31:21 must have been an old episode that oh it was I mean it was when munchie was on so it was quite a while
01:31:25 ago um oh okay there are some really um yeah no they're smells no they're they're bad yeah they're
01:31:31 really bad but it's okay um this one is called um ha ha bread you guys okay yeah yeah we're
01:31:40 three two one listen click play it all at the same time all right three two one go
01:31:47 hey so I found this really weird channel it's called rotating bread studios it's just a bunch of
01:31:58 videos of pictures of png's of bread rotating check it out it's prey based content I'm there
01:32:08 I'm there I can already picture it on my mind I don't feel like I even need to go see get out
01:32:14 this is uh like I get shocked I mean there's I mean my there's a little more to space no
01:32:22 oh just like just in it just an image yeah it's just a piece that it was just like a flat
01:32:27 I've seen the whole thing in my mind now although this one is my I didn't expect the Mike Myers in
01:32:32 the background of the bread 43 subscribers on a rotating bread studios okay it should be
01:32:39 rotating the other way I don't know why that's your critique the thing yeah the thing that's
01:32:48 wrong with rotating bread studios the bread rotates clockwise and I just it's too predictable it's just
01:32:53 everything rotates clockwise I want to shake it up it's just like the flat side should be like
01:33:02 pushing down it doesn't matter if we move on okay okay okay next next one is called a message from
01:33:08 our troops three two one go okay so I'm in the navy and I just returned from a six month deployment
01:33:18 and what do I find when I get back Gib and Digi have drank so much soy that they are now women
01:33:24 Ben has stolen Nate's soul and banished him to the shadow realm that's right has gone full
01:33:29 cuck and enacted communism on the podcast man imagine coming to her now for some reason
01:33:35 as I understand it once she has transcended from the virtual world into the real world and can now
01:33:40 come to my house and beat me up in real life which is truly scary I've done that in the first place
01:33:45 Tom is the only normal one left for the love of God Tom just save this train wreck of a podcast
01:33:52 oh is this what you were I can't tell if that was serious or a joke it feels like a joke
01:33:57 Tom is this what you were talking about yeah I like that Tom is the most I think it was a
01:34:00 joke with just kind of a weak punchline Tom who was going to like live in his car and make like
01:34:06 CG in a car it was like the most normal this this is a this is a thing it's true Tom you
01:34:13 I think a lot of people say I think some people say Tom is the is the is the normal
01:34:19 one but I think he Tom is just Tom is just the one that nobody has the voice of reason
01:34:23 that does not make him the normal one none of us are the normal one there's no such thing as
01:34:28 a normal pcp member Tom Tom is Tom is safe apple check and uncontroversial Tom is the apple jack
01:34:37 yeah so the hot wand the yeah that's right that's right he wears he wears the the boots the
01:34:46 really you know the boots he looks great the next one is called just kill them three two one go

01:36:26 we still have the summarized body but what we intend to do with it is strictly confident
01:36:31 you're gonna do sticky to it although our purpose for you Ben we want your brain
01:36:39 boo unique no your special Ben no thanks you see only you have the ability to both be an insufferable
01:36:48 bleeding heart liberal cuck yeah but also a utilitarian fascist dictator of the fictitious
01:36:57 voice jail only you thought you freed everybody from could argue the medical merit no not everybody
01:37:04 without actually knowing any of the science behind it Ben if you give us your brain we will
01:37:11 tell you the truth about the implanted samurai memories the secret origin consider the offer
01:37:20 we'll speak to you again next week Ben is this a recurring thing all right people or who's this
01:37:26 person there's a lot uh there's a lot of lore there's like a lot of backstory it looks uh
01:37:31 does it not matter it it matters to me um i hope you can work that out with yourself
01:37:39 how can i how can i how can i is there a way to make it matter to the audience as well
01:37:44 positive no okay that's all i would hope that they're all i would hope that they're already
01:37:49 invested um um you would help wait i'll give my brain in exchange for the samurai secret how
01:37:56 how would i how would i know the secrets then no i'm i this seems like bad deal bad deal
01:38:01 bad deal back to the drawing book you're fired you have a you have a counter offer
01:38:06 um nah i just not fuck it uh the samurai memories ah who needs them
01:38:14 yeah fuck you scroll scrolls gone i don't need to know about my tragic past it's it's
01:38:19 from probably better off not knowing next one next one is called uh milk main i don't know what
01:38:26 that means three two one go yeah so uh just listen to the latest episode i mean i wouldn't
01:38:32 have looked up that shoplifting comment for myself and uh i don't know i think i think the main issue
01:38:39 i see with it at least comes down to the tone like it doesn't really come across as a poor kid you
01:38:44 steal because they can't order so much as a spoiled fridge cube you just steal it no well it's not
01:38:50 that thing that was going on facebook no no no i don't understand what this guy's saying he sounds
01:38:55 i cannot hear a word he's saying i had to turn i had to turn up my headphones as high as they
01:39:01 would go i could make it out no he this is a vein this is a vein of of complaining this is a vein
01:39:06 of complaining about mallory what did he say uh you say like he said like uh the reason i didn't
01:39:12 like the comic where the shoplifting is because it comes off more as a spoiled rich kid instead of
01:39:19 a poor kid and like you you listen to the podcast she explained that no that's not what's going on
01:39:25 so shut up shut the fuck up i'm sick of it no more i will not fucking we had an entire podcast

01:39:38 voicemails about mallory it's over i'm with you based on this alone i don't know the whole context
01:39:43 but i know the comic you're talking about yeah uh we literally talked about it for hours there's
01:39:50 nothing more to be said did you really you talked about that one comic for hours well okay no not

01:41:33 let's see if craig now that now that munchie isn't on the podcast anymore uh now that munchie's not
01:41:41 anymore now i'm not breaking the no girlfriends rule so i guess that's why we this is like um
01:41:48 this it's like uh you're like um you know like legend of dragoon when you well your your green
01:41:55 party member dies but then like a new green party member dies who's basically just like a model swap
01:42:01 you're like that no munchie you're just like munchie munchie died but was like immediately
01:42:07 replaced by kazi which is basically just basically just munchie wearing a bow um yeah
01:42:14 yeah exactly well i mean i i mean i don't know i knew all of you guys anyway so it's true just like
01:42:24 uh okay next one next one is called uh sheva's guard three two one go
01:42:31 all right i've got a math problem i need your help with so if an anime being bad is a negative
01:42:39 and an anime's english dub is a negative and if a negative times a negative is a positive
01:42:44 does that mean the dub of a bad anime becomes a good anime because it's adding not multiplying
01:42:50 no you because you don't times them to you don't multiply it's it's a it's additive yeah
01:42:56 unfortunately so you can't uh you can't logic your way out of this one get rekt by math get rekt
01:43:03 get rekt fucker uh next one we're rapid firing next one is called make mary pcp three two one go

01:48:59 yeah sure yeah you got a whole essay here there are you could you could do better you could there
01:49:03 are better visuals there are better mediums than pcp voicemails i've been watching a mecha anime
01:49:09 recently and it it turns into jet planes and cars and it's not transformers well i supposed to
01:49:14 pause the badmobile no it's a space runaway idion or something oh idion i don't know that one good
01:49:22 it's the one that gundam boy made right uh after gundam oh what's the gundam guy's name i know it
01:49:29 tomi no tomi no yeah okay yeah yoshi yuki tomi no robots are stupid robots are bad they're all
01:49:38 right you drew a pretty cool robot one time i did i did draw i know i know exactly the one
01:49:42 you're talking about for for inktober oh yeah i don't remember what it looks like but i remember
01:49:48 it being good uh it looks like that pokemon that looks like a big ant the ultra beast oh yeah a
01:49:55 little bit like the yeah it looks kind of like that but as a robot i will you know what i will try
01:50:00 and scroll back through twitter and see if i can find the one you're talking about i think it posted
01:50:04 somewhere um okay next next up we got uh ben i get it you're a penis centrist three two one go
01:50:15 so uh you suggested say one out of a million people get their dicks fucked up from circumcision
01:50:21 where one out of a million people gets their dick fucked up from not washing it enough
01:50:25 if they are uncircumcised uh in the former group you can't control what happens to you
01:50:29 in the latter group you can it's your own failing to not wash it yeah so i'd rather be a part of
01:50:33 that latter group even still yes uh additionally yes the comparison to vaccines uh vaccines have
01:50:41 a very very tangible benefit and have far less pain than the circumcision and i know i know the
01:50:49 pain doesn't really matter it's ephemeral like who really cares this is the pain is just like an
01:50:55 addendum to the fact that it is still otherwise neutral the point is oh well if it doesn't matter
01:51:03 then uh why bother with this thing that just has basically no benefit uh has a very slight risk of
01:51:11 of things going worse and like kind of sucks for a couple seconds like there's no point in
01:51:17 bothering if circumcision didn't already exist we wouldn't like create it there was there would
01:51:22 be no need to create it like if i could say oh uh suppose that your armpits uh could could never
01:51:30 get stinky if you skinned them as a baby uh and it's ephemeral pain that you won't remember uh
01:51:36 and you won't have to put deodorant on but it's like we wouldn't do that if it were possible
01:51:41 because that's stupid just wear deodorant okay isn't this this just seems like the most obvious
01:51:47 arguing like he's right no like i don't even know why you guys had this argument his first
01:51:52 argument is wrong his first argument is wrong but i like yeah i agree that if it didn't exist we
01:51:57 probably wouldn't invent it in most cases it's like yeah true you're right about that but i really
01:52:04 hate the first part where you're like oh like i lay out this hypothetical where oh what if one in a
01:52:10 million people who circumcised gets lose their dick versus one in a million people who isn't
01:52:15 circumcised you know loses their dick for a different reason like i know that's not necessarily the
01:52:20 case i just but in this hypothetical situation it's like oh well i would rather be the second one
01:52:25 because it's my choice like no like if that doesn't that doesn't matter like if you fucking lose your
01:52:30 dick for whatever reason you you you currently would not rather to have made the choice that led
01:52:37 you to lose your dick you would be talking about how much of a fucking moron you had been your whole
01:52:41 life like it doesn't matter whether it was your choice or not i'm positing that for whatever reason
01:52:45 in each scenario one person loses their dick and it's equally bad the whole point of that scenario
01:52:51 is that it's equally bad and i won't do this oh well at least then it would have been my choice
01:52:55 like who gives a how do you hate that how do you lose your dick how do you lose your dick
01:53:00 in the second like it doesn't it doesn't it literally doesn't matter the details don't matter
01:53:05 it's like uh i don't know uh someone's one person in a million like doesn't wash their
01:53:10 dick and it gets infected and they have to have it amputated it's it what i like the details are
01:53:15 important take care of your dick or lose it oh you shut the fuck up oh god no that's that's
01:53:23 horseshit that's terrible that was a terrible that was a joke argument i don't care i don't know
01:53:29 what's a joke and what's not this fucking penis arc of the pcp is going on way too long i agree guys
01:53:35 the fact is the fact is that foreskin is cool it's cool it's just cool i don't i don't like it that
01:53:42 much well you don't have it yeah well if you had it you'd be like how wow i don't i don't i don't
01:53:49 no you're wrong you know i don't i don't think that's true uh i don't particularly i don't know
01:53:54 what it would be paulgan constantly bro that's disgusting that's so disgusting you look down
01:54:01 your paulgar's face that's really gross actually next in your own crotch and you make the paulgar's
01:54:06 face on your dick next voicemail thanks and good night uh oh link link to their okay this comes
01:54:17 with a link but whatever uh three two one go okay so there's like this one actor from
01:54:22 home alone two he played a really mining character in it but he's like got a job right now which he's
01:54:28 about to get fired from he's trying to sue sue to keep his job but it seems like it might not go through
01:54:36 so i'm thinking maybe use could try and get him onto the podcast and help build up support for him
01:54:41 and stuff you know that'd be pretty cool yeah i get it i get it uh it's donald it's donald j trump
01:54:49 uh 45th president of the united states of america famous famous for his appearance in
01:54:56 home alone two lost to new york amazing oh unfortunately he's been fired
01:55:03 tragically yeah we could have him on yeah he's gonna you know we could we could promote trump tv
01:55:09 you know pcp will be the only channel on trump tv he's maybe oh god we could we could become
01:55:16 media moguls this is it this is our big break this is gonna create so many new jobs and we're
01:55:22 gonna fill all of them we can take all of the fake non-existent people who who work um artificially
01:55:28 created um to to make fraudulent um biden votes and then funnel that into your subscriber count
01:55:35 so that trump will have to notice you and he will come on the show donald
01:55:39 donald j yeah donald j trump like his entire audience will be all those like fake and dead
01:55:44 people who voted for biden the phantom audience uh i'll just be competing over these fake numbers
01:55:53 uh that's that's how it's gonna be uh okay next one is called um what what it's called uh
01:56:06 where dat bts nibba's law three two one go uh this is pancakes with craters here listen i'm not here
01:56:16 to question the validity of circumcision right you know whether it's like oh oh it's like mutilation
01:56:22 baby but you know all that could be benefits to it no i'm here to ask ask the real questions that
01:56:28 questions that actually matter and that is what is more aesthetic circumcised or uncircumcised
01:56:35 penis circumcised frankly you know i might be biased but i'm gonna say circumcised because when i see
01:56:40 an uncircumcised penis i'm like oh like what am i supposed to supposed to do this extra skin on here
01:56:45 when i see a circumcised an uncircumcised penis i go whoo i go pog you go i don't i don't like
01:56:51 pogging so i would really rather not my stance is that it doesn't matter they're all penises are
01:56:58 beautiful if you wash them that's it that's yeah um i think yeah i mean i i don't really have a
01:57:06 preference for like like an aesthetic preference um i mean i don't think it's yeah they're both
01:57:15 yeah hell yeah i support both
01:57:20 i'm down with both you're the real you're the real centrist i'm the yeah i know i'm the hero take a
01:57:25 position the hero uh next next one is called pancakes the aesthetic of the male genitalia
01:57:33 we wait did i miss one i did i totally missed one uh yeah that one was not where my bts at
01:57:44 nibba's yeah i was wondering where the bts would come in here go three two one go yo quick question
01:57:52 for y'all where is like the other like radcon for bts like vlog type stuff like are you guys still
01:58:00 waiting for brad stuff to come out or what's going on with scenes you know all that other footage like
01:58:07 can you like press digi to like for that stuff or no or what's up with that thanks yeah i probably
01:58:13 have it um if there's anything that hasn't been released i probably have it um you you had like a
01:58:20 like a big you you collected all of our like phone videos that we were putting and you made
01:58:28 like part one or something oh i did make it well i mean like during radcon i had made
01:58:34 like some parts and then i think that i just ran out of time to continue doing that so
01:58:41 i probably still have a bunch of footage that i haven't cut together into anything because
01:58:45 i probably completely forgot i didn't know there was more immediately um i don't even know that
01:58:51 there is but if there is i will find out okay um pretty pretty cool pretty cool i think if there's
01:58:56 more shit i yeah i'm not sure that there is that much behind the scenes there will be for i guess
01:59:03 the ova one once that gets put out um but i want to wait until that's edited before i think i had
01:59:11 some like i had planned to release a final behind the scenes that included all the stuff
01:59:15 that i didn't want to spoil like stuff that was not out yet which is still not out yeah where's
01:59:22 the brodie lecture oh yeah i'm excited about that well that doesn't have any behind the scenes
01:59:26 footage okay it'll come out when it comes where's the brodie lecture though i edited like i will be
01:59:32 excited to watch some of it like six months ago god no i'm like the same way with the the the
01:59:39 sonichu two lecture is like three quarters done and i just haven't finished it and it's just been
01:59:44 like that for ever i i start like i went into it and i like thought of a way to edit it that would
01:59:52 be exciting and then i started doing that and it was two time consuming so i got like 15 minutes in
01:59:57 and i'm like well i don't want to undo all this editing but it'll be really weird if it's like
02:00:01 starts off heavily edited and then just disappears so just put a note on screen just be like i gave
02:00:08 up after this point i might do that and i also have considered adding bits into it where like
02:00:16 like i already had to add in a whole bit on derpy hooves because i just like completely
02:00:19 forgotten to talk about her like so like there's i'm sure there'll be other stuff i have to add
02:00:24 it you added you added in a segment on derpy hooves that's awesome yeah like a two minute
02:00:29 little bit about her yeah i just totally forgotten to mention her i think just the extrapolation of
02:00:35 so much out of like a character design you know i think that uh i don't know when i rewatching
02:00:40 this on a show i feel like there's more i could have said uh i feel like i didn't i definitely
02:00:45 didn't like you know say everything added in post i guess i could add it in post maybe i'd rather
02:00:53 just like leave it for a number like a hypothetical number three at some point could be done yeah
02:00:58 you should do what nate does and put your face over like like a like footage of you speaking and
02:01:04 then put your face over the face of you in the in the actual lecture and pause the lecture while you
02:01:10 do it wait put my face no whenever nate has something that he forgot to say during his like
02:01:18 but where he's speaking to the camera he'll pause the video and then put a bit of him with a shitty
02:01:23 webcam camera speaking footage and put that over his own head oh okay okay in like in a lecture
02:01:32 i don't know maybe just in general and in weagos and stuff okay okay well
02:01:40 maybe maybe if there's something i would do that if i felt like there was something that like
02:01:44 the audience really needs to know about to like understand the context of what i'm about to say
02:01:49 right yeah you know i thought about it for a couple minutes i think there's a few more i think
02:01:54 uncircumcised might actually be a little bit cooler i thought about it i might be leaning
02:02:00 towards that highly highly agree i don't know what the difference is what do you mean more
02:02:08 when they're erect they look exactly the same there's nothing there's there's no difference
02:02:12 it's pretty it's pretty similar yeah it's the only important part you're you're forgetting the magic
02:02:17 of erect by the time it's out of the pants then there's no it's not even happening that's not
02:02:22 true what about a half hard dick they just look cool what aesthetically that's it the half hard dick
02:02:29 is is is often forgotten the half the half job is pretty cool yeah yeah i i will agree with that uh
02:02:38 okay with their next one is called phallic person redux amazing wait wait i gotta upload it uh there
02:02:46 it is okay three two one go
02:02:51 hey i heard you got a big cock
02:02:58 i'm sick i wonder what this guy thinks about the circumcision you know what voice grail
02:03:07 i think should we put should we put phallic person in the voice grail i think yeah yeah i agree they
02:03:12 put in so much my work they've made multiple uh voicemails of just saying hey heard you had a nice
02:03:19 or a big penis cock nice yeah it's always such a treat such a boost to my morale yeah so let's
02:03:28 phallic phallic person you're in you're in the grail you ascend ah the light shines down and you
02:03:34 ascend uh uh into fucking the the realms beyond very congratulations you have done good work
02:03:41 congratulations good job uh next up is uh timisaurus uh here we go three two one go
02:03:52 hello i've just listened to the gloomy cast and if you have depression what helps a lot of people
02:03:59 is taking mag magic mushrooms specifically high doses um studies have shown that it helps
02:04:06 quite a lot it also makes you more creative by a lot and it doesn't make you it's very safe
02:04:18 to consume also um cancer patients approve okay everything he said is true i was just talking
02:04:27 to this guy uh 17 on twitter i've never heard of anyone i've never heard of anyone odying on
02:04:33 magic mushrooms yeah there's no there's nothing unsafe about mushrooms other than if you happen
02:04:38 to be tripping balls and do something retarded because you're already insane okay i've never
02:04:43 done a drug but i've always wondered though uh well they're fine i i tried i do them every day
02:04:49 i got mushrooms from a guy one time and i ate them but like they didn't work i think they were old
02:04:55 and like had like lost their power yeah well that's well i mean i guess i i drank some i only drank
02:05:01 with ben they are they're good for depression supposedly the mushroom well that sounds like
02:05:11 a recipe for just constantly needing more of them and not actually fixing depression it's like it's
02:05:20 the way that like doing major psychedelics will like open your mind is such a way that you might
02:05:25 be like decompressing about it for like fucking forever afterwards so it could be like a more
02:05:32 long-term solution than than that you know well i see all kinds of crazy shit then if it's if it's
02:05:38 super safe then i guess i wouldn't be averse to the idea of doing it at some point i would only
02:05:44 do it with something just to give it a try really i did a weed i smoked a bit come to america do some
02:05:50 acid and no the acid that's different isn't it shrooms and i don't think i ever you tell me you
02:05:57 tell me if i do it all the time you tell me how safe it is i don't know it's fucking it's fun to do
02:06:02 i'll tell you that much no i've heard acid is is the thing that killed well not killed well maybe
02:06:08 it did kill but like it made the the the original pink floyd guy loses mind what's acid like i mean
02:06:17 he was in pink floyd how like i guess they must have done a lot of acid but i think it was acid but
02:06:22 it's yeah i don't know acids are not usually known for i mean it can't i it can't make you insane
02:06:28 it might activate the fact that you're did you what drugs don't make you crazy uh basically
02:06:36 your brain stops sorting between what data is or isn't important and so everything start like
02:06:42 because you you cannot like if you're trying to look at something it's going to look like
02:06:46 it's moving because of the fact that uh your brain can't like ignore enough things to make
02:06:54 it look solid anymore you know what i mean like like just every piece of data is constantly going
02:07:01 through your brain and so depending on how you interpret this like if you if you're thinking
02:07:06 of it the way i'm thinking of it like i'm explaining it then you can get a pretty good handle on it
02:07:10 and just be like okay i'm just taking in more information than normal what do i do with that
02:07:15 the more acid you do the more you can parse that and not feel like you're tripping or anything
02:07:20 but if you are if you take enough of it that you can no longer keep track of everything that it will
02:07:26 feel like you're just seeing shit and losing your fucking mind so it really depends on like
02:07:30 how much dosage you do how much you let yourself go are you trying to you know create horrifying
02:07:37 visions or are you just trying to think a little harder see that that feels like it would give me
02:07:41 a headache is that is that accurate it does not give you a headache it puts you in a totally
02:07:48 different mind state from norm like doing acid is pretty like it's not extreme as like the effect
02:07:54 it has on you as a drug like oh your physical health it's extreme in terms of the psychological
02:07:59 effect of like you're not going to feel the way you normally do at all you know like the world
02:08:04 is going to feel like a kind of a different place um it's like everything is fractaling all the time
02:08:10 like if you stare at anything it will just endlessly frack and you'll be like wow i did not know i
02:08:16 could actually see this much like i did not know that you won't realize how much information your
02:08:22 brain is normally ignoring until you start not ignoring it you know what i mean that's intriguing
02:08:28 okay i'm looking at i'm looking at it as of as of 2008 there are no documented fatalities attributed
02:08:34 directly to an lsd overdose despite the several behavioral fatalities and suicides have occurred
02:08:41 due to lsd so it makes you yeah it makes you do things that would kill you just if you're somebody
02:08:46 who are who is suicidal then you and like you you know doing acid by yourself near a gun
02:08:53 like yeah you know who knows what could happen i think alcohol probably is more likely to lead
02:08:58 to suicide than acid like i can handle it then i would i just need a baby center i'm scared of
02:09:05 the it sounds like it burns you though it's acid it burns you know they call it that's let's do it
02:09:10 together it's more the effect it has on your perception because it feels like stuff's melting
02:09:15 like when you look at shit it looks like it's melting a lot of the time that's why i feel
02:09:19 like i would freak out before i do it i would have a bad trip before i get the acid in me
02:09:27 and i'd be all right probably i feel the same way i feel like i would have a have an oh god moment
02:09:33 and then take it and be like okay i understand what it is now because the fear of like not knowing
02:09:37 what it's gonna feel like is scarier than what it probably actually is yeah i was a little even scared
02:09:44 of of weed before i had tried it not too scared like i didn't think anything was gonna happen um
02:09:51 but i was i don't know i did it i was smoking it drugs are cool i mean i was scared of alcohol
02:09:58 i knew a lot of drugs and i was like i was scared of alcohol until i learned that it just made you
02:10:02 it's or at least for me it just made me like feel dizzy and just laugh at more things
02:10:08 it the that's good i have like that's pretty much the basis i have i can be like a happy drunk
02:10:13 or i can be like an angry then your your drunken state is unbelievable you i got some i got pretty
02:10:22 drunk i got pretty drunk uh on discord yesterday and i was very i was very i was feeling very grim
02:10:31 i was feeling very dour i basically told everyone on my discord that uh your problems don't matter
02:10:37 the apocalypse that sounds about right for you yeah you always say that you like hey you know
02:10:43 this is how you felt after winning the election well i was thinking about i would you say you say
02:10:48 winning um uh i was thinking about cove it i was like sure like sure sure my man j rob might be
02:10:54 might be repping me in the white house now but you know what's what's that gonna do he's gonna
02:10:58 get cove it too we're all gonna get it we're all fucked ben drunken third wave baby ben really drunk
02:11:04 is the kind of guy who will be like i fuck like to say to someone he does not hate say like i
02:11:09 fucking hate you like you are the worst person and then as long as you press him on it and go like
02:11:12 ben you don't think that i'll just be like yeah i don't think that i love you every single time you
02:11:19 do that that's true that's true uh okay let's uh next next one wait no no there's a bunch of like
02:11:27 duplicate emails here timisora sent like three that are all the same uh so the next one is
02:11:33 called um oh god it's another fucking circumcision one it's called ben just do
02:11:40 ben just do your research let's give it a chance let's give it a chance three two
02:11:44 fifty whole one go we probably won't listen been through a lot of gosh up the arguments against
02:11:50 circumcision is the use of they are shown as benefits are negligible and are statistically
02:11:54 insignificant yes i know yeah okay okay yes i know yes i know okay you're right yes circumcision
02:11:59 it's bad it's probably bad yeah probably don't probably don't do it unless a doctor's like hmm
02:12:04 if you don't circumcise this kid their dick's gonna fall off then then do it if they don't say that
02:12:08 yeah fine fine fine you got me i don't like circumcision there are you happy that's my
02:12:15 whole personality gone next one is called uh pancakes how do you do it um wait there it is okay
02:12:27 three two one go uh pancakes with creators here listen i was wondering what are you guys
02:12:35 more inclined to do when creating a story do you create cool characters and like create a world
02:12:42 around them or do you create a world and then like just start writing with characters just start
02:12:49 writing is this is is this like an architect versus gardener sort of sort of quandary i think digi
02:12:55 would have more of a yeah i usually build characters first like i am i will i have the bleach
02:13:03 method of like if i don't know what to do create 20 characters and then unlike bleach though i do
02:13:09 not then create a story i just have 20 characters and i don't know what to do with them um i think i
02:13:16 i think i based i think i do like an events based like it's not so much that i have like a character
02:13:23 or a setting i just have like an event that i build a story around like a like a climactic
02:13:28 moment then like and i see that better way and i see that moment and i'm like okay how can i
02:13:34 build a story that that builds to that that's how they wrote the entire third series where
02:13:38 whether the blocks that i'm starting with yeah personally i feel like i'm not anywhere near
02:13:45 good enough at making stories to like offer advice um i disagree because i've i've i don't know i've
02:13:53 done so much planning and world building on things that don't exist yet and probably never will well
02:13:58 that's not even like when i think storytelling like i don't think about like building an entire
02:14:04 fucking world and all that like you you've you've told tons of stories like you do tell stories good
02:14:10 yeah i mean when it comes to those they definitely start with a character and a point a and point b
02:14:19 um like uh lord of ghosts is i know what the whole thing is going to be like very movement
02:14:26 based like it's always about like a character moving through an environment i've noticed like
02:14:31 almost always yeah i i don't know why that is i think maybe it's just adventure adventure like
02:14:38 you don't want to stand around talking about a physical a philosophical idea because i'm stupid
02:14:43 i can't think of things things like that i want to run around shoot i want to be a cowboy go it's
02:14:48 like at the beginning of um spirited away vibes like that kind of like moving through the environment
02:14:55 sort of oh but the few times i've written stories i've also done the exact same thing
02:15:01 uh that's good i mean if you're in a visual medium that is the best way to tell a story in my
02:15:09 mind is like through you know environment and not through dialogue dialogue is is is useful for
02:15:17 certain types of information i guess i would say given that you draw comics like an animator
02:15:22 which is to say like it's focused on movement even though it's not moving um i guess i do i
02:15:30 think that um the only story the only stories worth telling are about the human heart in conflict
02:15:37 with itself georgia martin i think he stole that quote from someone else so no no no the way to
02:15:43 tell a story is to just have a bunch of like faces and have them expressing like very complicated
02:15:49 emotions that that's fuck environments environments are for losers you can't relate to an environment
02:15:57 yeah you can no that's i i tend to my excitement when i go to a city is to like look at it and
02:16:03 think about the shape of it and like why it's all laid out the way it is and how that affects people
02:16:08 i'll say the fucking uh seeing the the gigantic seagates in in uh one piece the you know the
02:16:18 architecture the the the all of the places in one piece are like really good at adding to the
02:16:24 story in the narrative of what's happening there when i see a really good environment it's like
02:16:29 a big cum it literally feels like oh my god like fuck yeah dude like look at this i want to be in
02:16:35 that place dude i get that feeling yeah same it's like i want to build it in minecraft i get i get
02:16:40 that specific feeling a whole lot reading one piece like if only i had the time to build this in
02:16:46 minecraft yeah i feel that way building my animal crossing island
02:16:52 so there you go um okay well yeah fuck me uh next one is called ben so about you playing

02:19:14 like all um it's been like five years leaving the fandom for context that's um it's about how
02:19:24 long it's gonna be until we see each other again because now that sleepy joe biden has won we all
02:19:33 get to go to sleep for the next four years i'm so i'm i'm excited i get to finally catch up on my rest
02:19:46 rest my old achy breaky bones you know i'm i'm 24 years old i'm an old man you know i i really
02:19:53 could use the rest so yep i'm happy good night pcp i'll see you in the morning in like four years
02:20:08 you're the new dawn at the dawn of the carlson presidency imagine if joe biden was like america
02:20:14 we're gonna all like go into hibernation for a while like we're gonna pause everything we're all
02:20:19 just gonna sleep until like coronavirus is over or something you know i would be you know i mean
02:20:25 the political project of the pcp getting joe biden elected uh has been accomplished so like this the
02:20:33 podcast has served its purpose we don't need it anymore um this was the plan all along and now
02:20:39 it's over uh take take take five everybody we did it uh next one we got two two more voicemails
02:20:48 and then we can call it a fucking day uh they're both from james so three two one go so you missed
02:20:56 the good parts on that circumcision shit so i looked up the numbers it's four and ten thousand
02:21:03 people have like problems so that could be anything you know but a non zero number of those problems
02:21:08 are uh one of them is degloving where the incision line separates so like all the ways you can
02:21:17 fuck up your dick the dick me and then i love they have like stitched that back together there's
02:21:22 not counting the kids that just straight up die from it or like have like weird
02:21:27 remember epstein's egg dick i think it's because of circumcision like i don't remember
02:21:32 ever kind of scrunch it all right i don't know yet a weird i mean that makes sense yeah
02:21:36 circumcision videos are fucking terrifying and then also the traditional jewish way to circumcise
02:21:41 a kid is to uh cut the foreskin off then uh the moille sucks the blood out
02:21:47 hell yeah and kids get herpes and die from that shit too blood libel baby she's fucking wild
02:21:53 um okay and then five seconds of silence um okay you know what i mean if the number is four
02:22:03 and ten thousand then that's probably too high so uh that sounds pretty bad maybe circumcision bad
02:22:10 after all whoopsie daisy you came around uh there's the more you know there's another one
02:22:17 there's one more from james more circumcision talk we we're almost there three two one go
02:22:23 i've been thinking about this one for a minute and just got the chance so fucking um listen
02:22:28 utilitarianism there's the most mathematically pure and simple way to describe it it's collecting
02:22:34 slime yeah yeah so like you want to do the things that make good slime people's brains and not do
02:22:39 the things that make bad slime like the example you gave was like what if you're gay and everyone
02:22:43 in the room is mad about it thinking of slides they kill you that gets rid of all their bad slime
02:22:48 what so you think that's good right wrong now every time they see their friends the ass and the
02:22:53 gym they have to worry about getting killed it says way more bad slime so if you just think about it
02:22:59 as a fraction of the good slimes like get that dopamine get that serotonin get the oxytocin
02:23:04 all those good slimes compare it to like the bad slimes like the cortisol yeah adrenaline the
02:23:10 norepinephrine all those slimes fuck those fucking slimes yeah keep those cop killer slimes come in
02:23:16 and fuck those ridey boy slimes yeah okay all right so so maximize the good maximize the good
02:23:22 slimes maximize the the the testosterone minimize the estrogen is what he's saying what a great
02:23:28 note to end on right i don't fucking know dude nice um well uh uh fuck yeah uh we did it we listened
