00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:12 Hello boys and girls.
00:00:16 Welcome to the big top.
00:00:23 It's The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:26 So we'll circus around here and there's no cheesy though.
00:00:30 It's a real, nah he unfortunately took his own life after that.
00:00:36 I don't know, that's not funny, that's not funny, that didn't happen.
00:00:42 After you bullied him.
00:00:44 Yeah, not after the Kickstarter failed, after I bullied him and said he was bad at math.
00:00:50 RIP.
00:00:56 Good morning, I guess it's not morning for you Gibb.
00:01:00 No it's not.
00:01:02 But I'm tired, just like I am tired every day.
00:01:05 Cause life is tiring.
00:01:09 You can think of another way to say that.
00:01:11 Yeah.
00:01:12 Well let me tell you what I'm sick and tired of.
00:01:17 Mega man.
00:01:19 Yeah, more nonsense with the stupid video.
00:01:22 It's not my fault, I swear it's not my fault this week, it really should have been at this week.
00:01:27 To briefly sum up why it's not out.
00:01:31 I finished rendering it, I uploaded it, and then I watched it through.
00:01:37 And there were a couple of small errors in it, but there were three really small errors that I noticed.
00:01:45 But they were all so small that I was willing to be like I don't care.
00:01:48 I'm gonna release it in its current state, fuck it.
00:01:52 But it has been, you know when you upload a video and it has to process and first it processes the video in standard definition.
00:01:59 And then it processes it in high definition, right?
00:02:02 Yes, yes.
00:02:03 Well, it's been processing it in high definition for I think like four and a half days now.
00:02:08 Which just doesn't seem right.
00:02:10 I think it's just stuck.
00:02:12 Sometimes it just gets stuck and I don't know why.
00:02:15 I mean, I would imagine it just takes a while.
00:02:18 How long does it take to upload fully?
00:02:21 Only like eight hours, ten hours.
00:02:26 Okay.
00:02:29 Yeah, I don't know how encoding is different, but like maybe it will just take a number of days.
00:02:36 Maybe.
00:02:37 I mean, I wasn't surprised.
00:02:39 I was expecting it to take a while because like it's in 1440p.
00:02:45 So it's gotta process it.
00:02:48 I mean, standard definition is 360p, but then it's gotta process it in 720 and 1080 and 1440.
00:02:55 So I was like, okay, it's a big video in a bunch of different resolutions including one of the highest res is available.
00:03:03 So I'm not surprised it's gonna take a long time.
00:03:05 But four days just seems excessive.
00:03:07 Is 1440p 2K?
00:03:11 Yeah, it's 1440 by 2560, which is the highest resolution that my camera could film in.
00:03:21 And also supposedly, yeah.
00:03:24 And also supposedly YouTube like compresses 1080p differently than 1440 and like 1440 looks better.
00:03:35 Not just because it's higher res, but because like 1080 looks worse than 1080 on YouTube,
00:03:40 but 1440 supposedly does not look worse than 1080.
00:03:44 This is what I read somewhere.
00:03:45 I don't know if it's true.
00:03:47 Like YouTube compresses 1080 more?
00:03:50 Yeah, like YouTube specifically compresses 1080 more is what I read.
00:03:56 Yeah.
00:03:57 I don't know.
00:03:58 But anyway.
00:04:00 So I don't know.
00:04:01 I guess it could just still be processing just because it's big and like maybe either way.
00:04:08 I started another render like like a day into the upload, I started another render because I was like,
00:04:13 I found those small errors and I was like, well, those are really frustrating.
00:04:16 I might decide to re upload.
00:04:19 Let me start another render.
00:04:20 So I started another render with the errors fixed and now it's been a couple days and that render is halfway done now.
00:04:27 Is that a smaller render without 2K?
00:04:29 No, it's the same render just with the errors fix.
00:04:35 And I'll tell you what the errors were.
00:04:38 There was one line that I said that got garbled because I accidentally I tried to correct for the volume and I accidentally shifted the clip like by half a second.
00:04:50 So I like say a word and then like I say I say the word like twice overlapping each other and it just sounds a little weird.
00:04:59 It's not even very noticeable.
00:05:01 And then there were two other times I meant to censor every instance of the word.
00:05:06 I shouldn't say only a few minutes into this video.
00:05:09 I shouldn't say the S word and the F word.
00:05:12 Okay.
00:05:13 Do you know those?
00:05:14 I'm not aware.
00:05:15 Okay.
00:05:16 Well, I won't admit the man.
00:05:17 I won't tell you.
00:05:19 But I tried to censor every instance of those words and I missed two S words.
00:05:26 I mean, I actually think it mattered very much.
00:05:29 This is why I was I was willing to ignore these.
00:05:31 I didn't care.
00:05:32 I was going to release it except that the processing hasn't been done.
00:05:35 So but I started another render and it's now halfway done.
00:05:38 So I'm thinking like I want to release it on a weekend.
00:05:42 So maybe the move now is just since I have to upload a new version anyway, because I think the HD processing is just stuck and it's not going to finish.
00:05:50 I might as well just let this render finish and then upload that version and then release that this weekend.
00:05:56 I think what I'm going to do is release it on Saturday, probably at noon.
00:06:02 Probably like the day after this episode goes live is my is my plan unless more of this same nonsense continues to happen.
00:06:10 But I mean, but eventually eventually this must resolve.
00:06:17 Eventually I will have a week where I don't say, oh, it's coming out this week and then I'm proven wrong.
00:06:24 Yeah, it'll know like it's becoming a meme at this point.
00:06:28 Yeah, I know.
00:06:29 It's been like I realized six weeks.
00:06:33 I mean, six weeks ago I posted on my Patreon.
00:06:37 I posted a Q&A update wherein I said the video is almost done.
00:06:41 Now, I didn't mean that it was like coming out that week.
00:06:44 I thought there would be like a few more weeks left.
00:06:47 So I thought maybe two or three more weeks from that.
00:06:50 So, you know, and it's been six.
00:06:56 Okay.
00:06:57 But anyway, the other thing, the other thing that's it's sort of amusing, but it's also a bit annoying is that a couple of people have seen the video already.
00:07:09 And I guess the reason why this happened is because I clicked that I wanted to automatically add it to a playlist.
00:07:16 And it did add it to the playlist and I thought it wouldn't add it until it went public.
00:07:21 But no, it, you know, unlisted videos can be part of playlist as well.
00:07:26 So there are maybe like 30 or 40 people saw it in this playlist and have seen it.
00:07:32 And there's like some comments on it now, even though it's unlisted.
00:07:37 I will, I will unfortunately, I think that's funny.
00:07:42 I kind of wish I could keep those.
00:07:44 But since I want to upload the fixed version, I will probably have to lose those comments when it goes when I when I publish the fixed version.
00:07:53 So sorry about that.
00:07:54 Early viewers, I appreciate your enthusiasm.
00:07:56 I really do.
00:08:00 Yeah, but they had to watch it in 360p, which looks, it looks terrible.
00:08:04 You can't even like see what's on the board behind me at 360p.
00:08:11 Unacceptable.
00:08:13 It is. It is unacceptable.
00:08:15 That's why I wouldn't release it.
00:08:17 Like otherwise I might have just like released it in SD and then waited for the HD processing to finish.
00:08:21 But like, I think, I think it's unwatchably bad.
00:08:24 I mean, if you're just listening to it, then it's fine, obviously.
00:08:27 But if you're trying to watch it, you can't watch it at 360p.
00:08:35 So that's, that's what's up.
00:08:38 That's, that's what's up.
00:08:43 For my week, I guess at the beginning of the episode, we just sort of like, we sort of settle on like you talk about what's been going on.
00:08:51 I talk about another Mega Man lecture.
00:08:53 I did it there.
00:08:54 And then it's, I mean, the only thing I've really been doing last week, well, there's a couple things, but it was a lot of not safe for work stuff.
00:09:05 So I'm like, well, I mean,
00:09:07 You mean drawing?
00:09:08 Yeah, drawing.
00:09:09 Yeah.
00:09:11 I did draw for cheesy a,
00:09:14 Oh, alien girlfriend.
00:09:17 Alien girlfriend.
00:09:18 I saw that because I am a patron of cheesy.
00:09:21 Oh, I saw that update on Patreon.
00:09:24 Yeah.
00:09:25 Yeah. So that'll be coming out when it comes out.
00:09:27 And that was fun.
00:09:29 And yeah, I've just been drawing a lot of dicks and tits and stuff.
00:09:37 There's commissions, right?
00:09:39 One of them was a commission.
00:09:41 There was a, there was another one that was similar.
00:09:44 But I've just been just, I just felt like it.
00:09:47 I just been drawing things that I want to see.
00:09:51 There's not really like a topic conversation unless you've seen them and want to say anything about them.
00:09:57 I don't know.
00:09:58 Are you posting them on big girl squish?
00:10:00 Yeah.
00:10:01 Do you, do you look a bit?
00:10:02 No.
00:10:04 Well, there you go.
00:10:05 Sorry.
00:10:06 Yeah.
00:10:09 Go to big girl squish.
00:10:10 If you want to see, I just finished this little like drawing of a five way between Vriska,
00:10:18 Kanaya, Rose, Terezi and June Egbert.
00:10:22 Cause like this, the John Egbert ghost trans is June Egbert fan thing, which is a cool idea.
00:10:29 They're all lesbians.
00:10:30 Vriska, Kanaya, June, Rose, Terezi and June.
00:10:35 Vriska, Kanaya.
00:10:37 Give that's fucked up.
00:10:38 That's incest.
00:10:40 Huh?
00:10:41 All trolls have the same mom.
00:10:43 You freak.
00:10:45 They never had any problem with it before.
00:10:47 If you draw any trolls can't have sex because they all come from the same incestuous slurry.
00:10:52 This is established in Canon.
00:10:54 They're just kissing.
00:10:57 Disgusting.
00:10:58 And their dicks are out, but that's all.
00:11:00 Disgusting.
00:11:04 Yeah, I don't know.
00:11:05 I feel pretty happy with my progress on that front.
00:11:09 I haven't made a lot of progress on Clarissa just for various reasons.
00:11:13 Other things have been taken priority.
00:11:15 I want to get that done.
00:11:19 It's so close.
00:11:20 I haven't really worked on it for two weeks at this point.
00:11:24 Well, it's not going to get done at that rate.
00:11:27 Yes.
00:11:28 That's the truth.
00:11:30 Yes.
00:11:31 Yes.
00:11:32 I'm sorry.
00:11:33 I'm sorry if that hurts your liberal snowflake feelings.
00:11:39 Sorry.
00:11:40 Sorry if that.
00:11:41 Sorry to bring harsh reality down on your tender little millennial head.
00:11:47 Participation trophy.
00:11:51 Yeah.
00:11:52 Where is my medal?
00:11:53 I drew like nothing for two weeks.
00:11:57 Exactly.
00:11:58 Soft.
00:11:59 Generation is soft.
00:12:01 Not enough lead.
00:12:03 Speaking of soft, did you see that selfie I took?
00:12:06 I was pretty happy without how I looked in that one.
00:12:09 Yeah, I think I did.
00:12:11 I think I did see that one.
00:12:13 You look like you just got out of the shower.
00:12:15 Yeah.
00:12:16 I just got out of bed and I was like, oh, cool.
00:12:19 Nice.
00:12:20 That's called liking the way you look and taking a picture of it.
00:12:24 That's a nice new thing.
00:12:25 That's crazy.
00:12:26 That's crazy, darling.
00:12:28 You ever done that?
00:12:29 You ever seen yourself and said, hey, cool.
00:12:32 Yeah.
00:12:33 Yeah.
00:12:34 Once or twice.
00:12:35 Yeah.
00:12:38 Hell yeah.
00:12:40 Okay, end of discussion.
00:12:45 It sucks sometimes when I'm like, I don't really have any like conversations to bring
00:12:54 or like things to talk about.
00:12:56 It's been a bit of a running theme plus few weeks.
00:13:00 I don't know about that.
00:13:04 I feel like it's been fired, but you know, for me, I don't know.
00:13:13 Other than like, I have this week, I didn't do much more work on slime and punishment.
00:13:19 That's the two things I've been working on is getting this stupid video published and
00:13:22 getting the slime and punishment book layout completed so that I can actually order the
00:13:27 test copies.
00:13:28 I didn't do that much on slime and punishment this week.
00:13:31 It was mostly, honestly, it wasn't even really working on the video because like the video
00:13:37 is done and all I had to do was watch it through again and make a couple of small corrections.
00:13:42 It's mostly just been ringing my hands and like just like sitting in like, you know, anxious
00:13:50 anxiety and stuff about like, I can't believe the video is not out yet.
00:13:55 I said the video is going to be out.
00:13:57 When is it going to be done?
00:13:58 Is it done in HD processing today?
00:14:00 No.
00:14:01 Okay.
00:14:02 Well, now what do I do?
00:14:03 Now how do I modify my plans?
00:14:06 Someone called Crow is looking in my patron discord advised me on some tips and said like,
00:14:16 Ben, you should make a trailer.
00:14:18 You should make a trailer and then premiere the video as a premiere.
00:14:23 And I think that's what I'm going to do.
00:14:26 That's what that's what patrician TV did this week.
00:14:29 This week, the 20 hour analysis of Skyrim came out and he like released a video advertising
00:14:38 it as well as like set it as a premiere.
00:14:41 And like, so like the premiere was set to release and while the premiere was set to release
00:14:45 this ad came out being like, it's coming this week.
00:14:49 So I think that's like kind of like bad for a 20 hour video.
00:14:55 Why?
00:14:56 Because like, I mean, I would assume there's like sections that you could skip to if you're
00:15:00 interested.
00:15:01 But if it's premiering, you have to wait 20 hours before you can start skipping through
00:15:04 the video to see the parts you want to listen to.
00:15:07 Yeah.
00:15:08 I mean, I guess, I guess, I mean, yeah, that's fine.
00:15:14 Like, I'm sure people liked it.
00:15:16 I think that's a long time to wait before the video is over.
00:15:18 That's the one thing I don't like about premieres is the fact that you can't use them as a video
00:15:23 like any other video.
00:15:24 It's like a worse version of any other video on YouTube.
00:15:27 Yeah.
00:15:28 Yeah.
00:15:29 I mean, on a practical level, that's true.
00:15:31 That actually I also like I checked out the premiere as it was happening and I well, I
00:15:37 like wasn't interested in watching it live.
00:15:40 I kind of like scrolled back to the beginning, which you can do.
00:15:42 You can you can rewind a premiere and watch it from the beginning if you catch it midway
00:15:47 through, but you can't fast forward past where it is in its air.
00:15:51 So I didn't have the time at the moment.
00:15:54 So I didn't I didn't watch it as it was airing, although I could have if I had the free time.
00:16:00 Yeah.
00:16:01 It's a it's a not a big deal.
00:16:04 I am and they're they're good for hype.
00:16:07 So whatever.
00:16:08 Yeah.
00:16:09 I think so I think I'm going to do that.
00:16:12 I think I'm going to set it as a premiere.
00:16:14 And then I think I'm going to release some a some some like trailers that will hopefully
00:16:21 get people like notified.
00:16:23 And I'm pretty sure I mean at this time, like I really think I'm not lying this time is
00:16:30 that it's going to be this Saturday the day after this video goes out.
00:16:34 I think that's when I'm going to do it.
00:16:38 I've been fucking around.
00:16:40 We're far enough into the video that I can say the F word now.
00:16:45 I've been fucking around with the making the trailer and I just can't settle on which
00:16:53 classic Mega Man theme to use as the music, as the musical backing for my trailer.
00:17:01 Hmm.
00:17:02 It's so difficult.
00:17:04 As a non Mega Man fan.
00:17:06 The obvious first choice for me would be the title screen of Mega Man 2 because that's
00:17:12 the most iconic to me.
00:17:14 Titles.
00:17:15 Mega Man 2.
00:17:22 Wait a minute.
00:17:24 Is that the same?
00:17:25 Hold on.
00:17:26 Hold on.
00:17:28 Is that also the Wiley boss song?
00:17:33 Hang on.
00:17:34 Hang on.
00:17:37 You know how like it starts slow and then it goes up and there's that intro bit of the
00:17:42 song.
00:17:43 Yes.
00:17:44 And then Mega Man appears at the top of the building is like it's all cool.
00:17:49 Yeah.
00:17:50 No, it's not the same, but it's very it's similar.
00:17:53 I think they share like I never thought about this before, but when you were humming it right
00:17:56 there, I was thinking that sounds like the Wiley's Castle song.
00:17:59 I think they share sort of a motif.
00:18:01 I think they're like a pitch shifted versions of each other now that I think about it.
00:18:06 I never noticed before because that one of the ones I was considering was the Wiley's
00:18:11 Castle one song from Mega Man 2.
00:18:15 Also Metal Man theme is really good.
00:18:18 Also the intro song from I think I think Mega Man 4.
00:18:22 I think it's 4 was the one.
00:18:25 Snake Man theme is good.
00:18:27 Also, I was also considering there's a couple of songs from Zero that I think are pretty
00:18:32 good, but like they're not they're not like hype.
00:18:35 They're not like hype and fun in the way that Mega Man songs are.
00:18:38 They're sort of like somber or mysterious, which is sort of a different vibe.
00:18:44 But I kind of think that would work in its own way.
00:18:48 Yeah.
00:18:49 So, you know, I like airman stage.
00:18:52 I've heard that in a lot of YouTube poops.
00:18:54 Yeah, that one's fine.
00:18:57 It's not it's not one of my favorites.
00:18:59 It's not my favorites.
00:19:00 Also, it's it's really funny.
00:19:02 I was I was going through the the song listings this week for this reason and it's really
00:19:09 funny how shit the music from one is like Mega Man one is like pretty bad.
00:19:15 Honestly, the music sucks.
00:19:17 And then suddenly you get to two and it's like classic after classic.
00:19:22 Yeah.
00:19:23 Yeah.
00:19:26 How does I'm trying to think because I know like at least cut man stage got burned into
00:19:31 my brain because I kept losing.
00:19:34 I forget how it goes though.
00:19:36 So I guess not.
00:19:37 I don't remember because it's not that good.
00:19:39 It's just not it's just not that good a song.
00:19:42 Also, I was talking to Tech Tonic Improv about the X series music and we I think we agreed
00:19:51 X2 is just is just bad.
00:19:53 I mean, it's not bad, but it's just way X1 and X3 just have like far and away better music
00:19:58 than X2 in my opinion.
00:20:00 The same composer.
00:20:02 I don't know.
00:20:03 I think so.
00:20:04 You know, I don't actually know.
00:20:07 But like three has all the music in three sounds like a hair metal like screeching like electric
00:20:13 guitar like and and but it's iconic but it's iconic.
00:20:25 Yeah.
00:20:28 Good good good stuff.
00:20:29 Good stuff.
00:20:30 It's been so that having that decision to make has been an excuse was an excuse for me to
00:20:35 spend like a bunch of yesterday just like going through Mega Man music and listening to it
00:20:41 and being like, yeah, that's a cool song.
00:20:42 Yeah.
00:20:43 That's a cool song.
00:20:44 So that was fun.
00:20:46 Still haven't made it.
00:20:47 Still haven't made a decision.
00:20:49 Okay.
00:20:50 Okay.
00:20:51 Okay.
00:20:52 I guess that's all I have to say about it.
00:20:55 Unless unless you want me to post the MP3s of the of some of the more offbeat picks that
00:21:01 I've been going over and I can tell Eleazar to play them in the episode.
00:21:06 Yeah.
00:21:07 Let's have a listen.
00:21:08 All right.
00:21:09 You know what?
00:21:10 I don't know too much about Mega Man music.
00:21:11 You know what?
00:21:12 I'll do it because I can.
00:21:15 Let me see here.
00:21:17 Let me see.
00:21:18 Okay.
00:21:19 These are the I'll show you the classic.
00:21:22 No, not the classic one.
00:21:24 The ones from the ones from zero that I think are a little are a little weird as choices,
00:21:28 but I think I kind of like them.
00:21:31 Where did I post those?
00:21:34 Oh, it's processing just like the YouTube video.
00:21:37 It's still processing.
00:21:38 Okay.
00:21:39 There it goes.
00:21:40 It's called X the Legend.
00:21:42 Three, two, one, go.
00:21:50 It's like Dark Hyrule Castle.
00:21:54 I think this would be funny.
00:21:58 I think this is kind of funny and a trailer for the lecture with this music sort of implies
00:22:02 that like this lecture is like a big deal.
00:22:05 This is like the ultimate fucking Mega Man lore.
00:22:08 Like, are you fucking kidding me?
00:22:10 Are you handle?
00:22:11 Are you?
00:22:12 Are you afraid of all this content?
00:22:15 Yes, like dark clouds and thunderbolts and like big techs flying in like all coming soon.
00:22:22 Exactly.
00:22:23 Exactly.
00:22:24 Coming soon.
00:22:25 You are not prepared.
00:22:26 Okay.
00:22:27 Here's one.
00:22:28 Here's one.
00:22:29 This one's called Cyber Elf.
00:22:31 That is sort of, well, three, two, one, go.
00:22:46 This one's sort of like, what is this?
00:22:49 What is this going to be about?
00:22:51 What is it?
00:22:52 What experience am I the viewer going to have?
00:22:57 There's a certain like noisiness to the console with this music.
00:23:04 This is the Game Boy Advance.
00:23:06 Oh, yeah.
00:23:07 Definitely.
00:23:08 There's such a sort of like a noise on like, I mean, that's just what Game Boy Advance music
00:23:17 sounds like.
00:23:18 I was a little disappointed going through.
00:23:19 I wanted to pick some music from zero, but going through the tracks like not that many
00:23:24 of them are iconic.
00:23:25 There's a couple.
00:23:26 There's a couple that are iconic, but a lot of them just sound like kind of muddier than
00:23:32 like classic games and X games.
00:23:34 And I kind of think just the music on the GBA was just not as good.
00:23:38 It was quite good for a handheld.
00:23:40 I think it sounds a lot better when it's coming from the actual device.
00:23:46 That's probably true, yeah.
00:23:49 Like they managed to get, because those are on cartridges and they managed to get quite
00:23:54 a lot of like dynamic range into the songs on a GBA cartridge.
00:24:00 Definitely compared to a Game Boy.
00:24:03 Here's a good one.
00:24:05 This is Flame Mammoth's theme from X1.
00:24:10 Three, two, one, go.
00:24:17 And this one's kind of like get hype for a video.
00:24:22 Coming soon to a YouTube near you.
00:24:25 You pig.
00:24:26 Get ready to get hype to consume your sloppy fucking slave.
00:24:33 Actually, there's that screechy guitar.
00:24:37 This isn't even an X3.
00:24:38 X3 is even screechier guitars.
00:24:44 Oh, I thought it was supposed to be a trumpet.
00:24:50 I hear a guitar.
00:24:54 Actually, I'll play one more.
00:24:58 I'll play one more.
00:24:59 This is the one that I'm leaning most heavily towards at the moment.
00:25:02 This is the intro to, I think it's X4?
00:25:07 Not an X4.
00:25:08 I think it's a classic four or five.
00:25:11 I don't even remember which one this is the intro to.
00:25:13 Three, two, one, go.
00:25:17 Oh, I've heard this one before.
00:25:20 Yeah.
00:25:21 Which one is this?
00:25:24 I think it's, is it five?
00:25:26 Because it kind of sounds like blues.
00:25:28 And blues is like the Deuter, not the Deuteragonist.
00:25:32 The secondary antagonist of five.
00:25:40 Yeah, this is a good one.
00:25:42 I think this is pretty iconic.
00:25:45 I had forgotten about this one.
00:25:47 I was going through the list.
00:25:49 I was going through the games and I heard this one.
00:25:51 I was like, oh my God, I forgot this song existed.
00:25:58 Oh my God.
00:26:00 How does such beauty exist in eight bits?
00:26:05 They just try really hard.
00:26:07 I guess they just tried really hard.
00:26:09 And you know what?
00:26:10 You did it.
00:26:13 But a musician, composer, could you just try a little harder, please?
00:26:16 Okay.
00:26:17 Yes.
00:26:18 Yes, I went to school to the piano.
00:26:21 I went to school to try hard at such things.
00:26:24 And so I am prepared for this request.
00:26:28 Mr. Boss Man of Capcom, sir.
00:26:31 Mr. Inafune, my lord.
00:26:37 Are you going to be like speaking or is it just going to be like text?
00:26:41 It's going to be, there's like a funny clip of the intro because I edited the intro.
00:26:47 So like the video starts with a little Mega Man 2 like boss intro jingle.
00:26:55 And then I like teleport down into the screen like Mega Man teleporting into the level.
00:27:02 And then I say a funny line and then it immediately cuts to like black screen with text.
00:27:09 And there's like a progression of text message being like premiering, you know, this Saturday,
00:27:14 an eight hour lecture.
00:27:18 And then so it's sort of like a cut, like a hard cut to like music and black screen text.
00:27:25 Also, I think I've decided, and this was the process of like a long iterative process for me to decide the title of the video.
00:27:34 I think the title of the video is going to be Every Mega Man Games Lore Explained in Obsessive Detail.
00:27:42 And I had to choose that adjective obsessive.
00:27:49 I considered many other adjectives.
00:27:51 I did like excruciating.
00:27:54 I like excruciating.
00:27:57 I probably overthought this, but to me excruciating implies that like the video is painful.
00:28:05 And I don't want to send these subconscious messages to people that like you will suffer if you watch this video.
00:28:12 Obsessive is self-deprecating.
00:28:15 It makes me sound like a nerd, but it doesn't necessarily imply that you will have a miserable time as a viewer.
00:28:23 Also, it's more commonly known.
00:28:26 It's a more common word than excruciating.
00:28:28 Spork pointed out that some people might not know what excruciating means, and I think that's probably true.
00:28:33 Yeah, I think obsessive seems too soft though.
00:28:39 You think so?
00:28:40 I think if you're like obsessive, it's not like exaggerated enough.
00:28:46 Maybe if you said insane, like insane detail, you're still self-deprecating.
00:28:53 Yeah.
00:28:56 I mean, the one about Pretty Little Liars was unhinged.
00:29:06 The Pretty Little Liars video calls itself unhinged.
00:29:09 Yeah, that's a pretty good one.
00:29:10 The Carrie Can Read video calls itself desperate.
00:29:15 A little freak talks about Mega Man.
00:29:18 A little freak talks?
00:29:21 I saw Carrie posted, when she made another sort of similar video later, and she posted it on...
00:29:28 She doesn't really use Twitter that much, but she made a Twitter update to announce that new video.
00:29:32 And the Twitter announcement was just like, hey guys, I made a new unhinged video, lol.
00:29:40 You know, the unhinged genre of video.
00:29:43 I've made a new one in that genre, and here it is.
00:29:45 I love those.
00:29:46 Oh, hell yeah.
00:29:48 I mean, I do.
00:29:49 I mean, I do love those.
00:29:50 It's a brand.
00:29:52 Yeah.
00:29:54 But unhinged.
00:29:56 Her video was not unhinged.
00:29:57 That was Mike's video was unhinged.
00:30:06 Anyway, I put a lot of time into considering such things, and I just wish it were over.
00:30:17 I just wish the nightmare were over.
00:30:19 As I say, I would have released...
00:30:23 Errors and all, I would have released the video already if YouTube had simply let me, but it fucked up, I think.
00:30:30 I think it fucked up.
00:30:31 I think it should not have taken this long.
00:30:33 I don't know.
00:30:34 So it's not my fault.
00:30:35 It is 2K in eight hours.
00:30:37 I feel like it's not that unusual.
00:30:39 I'm not too surprised by being multiple days, but I guess I'd have no experience with it.
00:30:47 Well, I'll tell you what.
00:30:50 I mean, if Saturday rolls around...
00:30:54 Ooh, oh no.
00:30:56 Because now I have to choose one of...
00:30:59 I was going to say I could just see what happens, and if this one does finish processing, I can just release this one.
00:31:09 But if it doesn't, then it's an error.
00:31:11 I could upload the other one, and I could set that one to release.
00:31:13 But if I set one to release, and then I tell people, oh yeah, here's the premiere, and then I can't just decide, oh well shit, it didn't work.
00:31:22 I got to release the other version.
00:31:24 Can you not...
00:31:27 They'd be linked to the wrong file when it doesn't actually end up erroring.
00:31:32 Can you not set a premiere after it's ready?
00:31:38 Yeah, I mean you can.
00:31:40 But I'm saying that if I release the trailer, or the ad for it, and then I switch which file, the link would be to the wrong video.
00:31:51 Or the one that had been up on my channel, showing as premiering in two days or whatever, that would then be the wrong video.
00:32:02 Because I would switch it out at the last minute for a different upload.
00:32:09 It just seems bad.
00:32:11 Can you just change the link in the description or whatever?
00:32:16 Yeah, I mean I guess I could.
00:32:21 I don't know what the problem is.
00:32:24 I mean you don't see a problem with like, you know, on your channel and your recent uploads, the most recent upload will be like premiering, it'll be a link to a video that's like premiering in two days.
00:32:36 And then when the countdown ends, like sometime before the countdown ends, you like take that video down and put up a new one to premiere.
00:32:45 Oh, but it's a different video technically.
00:32:52 I mean just anyone that had clicked that link would find themselves, you know, not linked to anything.
00:32:57 Right, but like I'm saying like...
00:32:59 I mean I guess it wouldn't be that bad.
00:33:01 Wouldn't you just like wait to see if both of them work and then choose which one to premiere?
00:33:08 Yeah.
00:33:09 Because if the one...
00:33:10 I mean don't do that unless...
00:33:11 I feel like that's the point where you make the decision on which one you want to show.
00:33:16 Well that's, I mean that's what I'm gonna do.
00:33:19 When this render is done, which should be another like two days I think, I will upload this version and then see if it processes any more quickly.
00:33:28 And if it does, I'll just use this one.
00:33:30 But if it doesn't and like the other one is still processing, then I'm like, well I have to wait for one or the other finish.
00:33:41 Um.
00:33:43 Hum-num-num-num-num-num.
00:33:46 Hum-num-num-num-num-num.
00:33:48 No.
00:33:50 My goal this week is to try not to worry about it too much and just kind of let it play it.
00:33:59 Let's just kind of let it process or let it upload or let it be however it's gonna be.
00:34:05 And in the meantime, get back to the slime and punishment book because I was making progress on finishing that.
00:34:13 Finishing those files up and that was good a couple days ago.
00:34:19 I guess I did work on it earlier in the week.
00:34:21 Haven't for the last couple days though.
00:34:25 Ugh.
00:34:29 Well, you know how like Twitter people saying it's gonna be destroyed and all that?
00:34:37 Yeah.
00:34:39 I've considered like where I would go to post stuff.
00:34:42 I don't really like any of the possible options.
00:34:45 Yeah.
00:34:47 I made a Tumblr the other day and it sort of immediately sucks.
00:34:54 Well, as a viewer, you can't find anything.
00:34:59 It sort of puts you in a bubble almost immediately.
00:35:02 Click some things you like and then it just shows you those three things over and over again until you start searching for specific different things.
00:35:10 You mean tags?
00:35:12 Tags or genres of things.
00:35:14 They don't seem to show you a lot of new stuff to get interested in.
00:35:18 Because I clicked on like, I was like, I just want to see Ryska.
00:35:22 Who's on Tumblr making Ryska drawings?
00:35:24 I searched that, I clicked like on a bunch of things and then I'm only getting home stuck on my 4U section.
00:35:30 Well, yeah, I mean, what do you expect?
00:35:31 Well, yeah, but like that, like, I feel like the algorithm's a little too like pushing the thing that I've, like, I haven't put, given it enough inputs yet.
00:35:43 Like, why would it not be trying to show me new things?
00:35:47 You think Twitter shows you more un-requested stuff?
00:35:53 I don't know. It's just, as a new user, it feels like an uphill battle to find stuff if I don't already know what it is.
00:36:03 And I probably will not use Tumblr for that reason unless I stay there for ages and do all the backbreaking labor of doing my own algorithm.
00:36:15 I'm the algorithm. I have to find everything myself. I don't know.
00:36:20 I mean, I don't have a backup plan for besides Twitter. I did have an old Tumblr that I guess I could use if I wanted.
00:36:30 I remember deleting my old give and take or give and tumble, I think is what it was called.
00:36:35 You did?
00:36:36 Yeah, I deleted it at some point.
00:36:37 Why?
00:36:38 I don't know. I think I was, my mind, my thought process was if I really want to stop looking at this and checking it all the time, I need like a hard cut, like no more sort of thing.
00:36:59 So I took the ultimate plunge and deleted my account. It wasn't really out of any...
00:37:03 Why did you want to stop looking at it?
00:37:06 I think for productivity reasons. This was like a long time ago at this point. I can't really remember.
00:37:12 I'm like, I got to work harder and I always go to Tumblr every day all the time.
00:37:16 Got to turn that off and I couldn't.
00:37:22 But I made a new account and it's boring. I don't care.
00:37:27 Yeah, I mean, I kind of want to, I think I've been saying I sort of want to be on Twitter less and I think I have been, I mean, I haven't been tweeting as much.
00:37:39 I mean, I still look at it, but not like, I don't know, I just look at it like a couple times a day.
00:37:46 It doesn't take too much time, I guess.
00:37:51 Yeah, I use it quite a lot, honestly.
00:37:55 Well, I still use it, but I think I use it less recently, which is good.
00:38:01 And it's a trend that I think I want to continue because nothing good has ever come from it.
00:38:08 Hey, did you play any more Inscription?
00:38:13 You know, oh, I DM'd you, but we didn't talk about it on the show.
00:38:21 Oh, you did? Yeah, we did talk in DMs a little bit.
00:38:24 I got a little frustrated with Inscription and it was generally, here's my hot take and I know I'm wrong.
00:38:34 Okay.
00:38:35 But it's just sort of my emotional reaction because the core gameplay is roguelike sort of essentially like you have a good run and you do what you can, but most of the time you're not going to win.
00:38:51 And I'm a little brat and I don't like that.
00:38:54 I don't like it when I have a bad run, when I get the wrong cards offered to me.
00:38:59 Right.
00:39:00 But you know, that's a genre of game I'm just not into.
00:39:03 But I was frustrated because I liked the card game, but I felt like early on, at least, it wasn't telling me the extent of the card game.
00:39:20 Every time I died, something new would happen, something extra would be revealed in the mechanics.
00:39:26 And now I'd be like, okay, fine.
00:39:28 So I wasn't supposed to get very far because I wasn't able to, I didn't know about bones or I didn't know about this item.
00:39:35 And I'm like, okay, so the more times I die, the more gameplay elements will be revealed, I guess.
00:39:41 And I just got, it's sort of annoyed me because it was like, how many times do I have to die before I can play this game?
00:39:49 I ended up just killing myself a few times and being like, okay, finally, some story is happening.
00:39:55 And I think I know all of the game mechanics now, finally I can start the game.
00:40:00 And I just lost over and over again.
00:40:02 I mean, there's things you have to do by playing the game.
00:40:06 You got the caged wolf, right?
00:40:10 Yeah.
00:40:11 I mean, you got to uncage that wolf in the game.
00:40:16 I did.
00:40:17 You got to make that.
00:40:18 So I mean, it's not just about like, you just got to die a bunch of times.
00:40:21 Right.
00:40:22 I don't know.
00:40:24 And you found the eye, right?
00:40:27 Yeah, I found the eye.
00:40:28 You told me you found the eye.
00:40:29 Yeah, stuff like that.
00:40:30 You got to make it happen.
00:40:32 Yeah.
00:40:33 I guess it just gets a little, it's a little tough, the game.
00:40:42 I'm not very good at it.
00:40:45 Well.
00:40:46 I get to the angler and I just, I don't have a good deck built up.
00:40:52 Maybe I chose the wrong path to get here.
00:40:54 And when I, you know, on some of the things I was unlucky, I chose the wrong card out
00:40:59 of the three that wouldn't have helped me.
00:41:01 My totem sucked or like, you know, whatever it is.
00:41:05 And then I get there and I'm like, I'm unprepared and then I lose.
00:41:08 And I'm like, you know what?
00:41:09 Fuck it.
00:41:10 I just got frustrated.
00:41:12 Yeah.
00:41:13 I mean, I get it.
00:41:14 I mean, that's how you get better is you, you, you lose a bunch of times and then you
00:41:19 think to yourself, hmm, why did I lose?
00:41:21 And then you don't, don't do that again.
00:41:24 Yeah.
00:41:25 Yeah.
00:41:26 Like I said, I know I'm wrong, but there's a lot of variables as to my failure.
00:41:34 I feel like in any other type of game, like, oh, it's a Mario.
00:41:39 Why did I lose in Mario?
00:41:40 Well, I jumped too early and I fell down.
00:41:43 It's very clear what happened.
00:41:44 And I should think about my timing of that particular jump better next time that, you
00:41:48 know, my, my problem is very clear.
00:41:50 The goal is very clear.
00:41:52 And I know how to approach improving when it comes to a inscription.
00:41:57 I don't know whether I could have done any better with the lack of the draw or whether
00:42:04 like, like what, what exactly did I do wrong?
00:42:08 I don't know.
00:42:09 I drew, I didn't draw the right card.
00:42:11 So my deck should be smaller or bigger or have less of one type of card and more of
00:42:17 another.
00:42:19 There's just too many, too, too many different little things that it could have been that
00:42:23 I don't really know what I'm the hell I'm doing the next time I boot it up.
00:42:26 So I'm like, okay, I guess I'll just hope to be luckier next time.
00:42:30 I don't feel like I have like a clear goal of how to improve myself as a player.
00:42:35 And that's, that's the frustrating part.
00:42:38 Okay.
00:42:39 But I mean, you know, as you say, you know that that is not correct.
00:42:43 Yeah.
00:42:44 Yeah.
00:42:45 Yeah.
00:42:46 That's why I hate roguelikes though.
00:42:47 This is like it.
00:42:48 I just want to know.
00:42:49 I just, I don't like thinking about it.
00:42:51 Yeah.
00:42:52 Yeah.
00:42:53 I mean, uh, yeah, I, I mean, that's like the, the, the, the goal is to figure out through
00:43:01 trial and error, how trial and error is so much.
00:43:05 Okay.
00:43:06 Okay.
00:43:07 Okay.
00:43:08 So that's why I hate it.
00:43:09 I hate it because, uh, when you go into, uh, like on a high difficulty setting,
00:43:13 what do you mean it's the reason you hate uncharted?
00:43:15 It's not similar.
00:43:16 No.
00:43:17 It's the slightest, the, the, the fighting, the shooting segments in uncharted, at least
00:43:22 uncharted one, often rely on a lot of trial and error.
00:43:25 You don't know exactly where is the best location for you to be where the next wave appears.
00:43:30 The, the next wave can appear behind you.
00:43:32 They can appear in such a way that if you haven't moved at a certain time, you're
00:43:37 fucked and it's like, you have to play and in uncharted the scenarios, you know, the
00:43:45 waves appear in the same places, the same types of guys every time.
00:43:48 So you learn by dying over and over where you should be.
00:43:52 And I hate that so much.
00:43:55 That's totally an unfair comparison.
00:43:58 I just know it's just the concept of trial and error piss me off.
00:44:02 It makes me mad in inscription.
00:44:05 I mean, it's trial and error.
00:44:06 I'm not saying that they're equivalent.
00:44:07 I'm just an example of a different type of trial and error.
00:44:12 The difference is that in inscription, like, yes, you do have to learn the rules and you
00:44:17 do learn the rules by losing and asking yourself, you know, what, what made me lose?
00:44:21 How can I avoid losing in the future?
00:44:23 But your eventual loss or victory is the sum total, you know, it's brought about by the
00:44:30 sum total of the decisions that you made.
00:44:33 It's not, you know, you're suddenly presented with a new scenario and, you know, you know,
00:44:37 you got to choose.
00:44:38 Do I go left, right or center and, you know, right or center will kill you and left is
00:44:42 how you win.
00:44:44 So, I mean, stick my neck out for inscription a little bit.
00:44:48 You know what?
00:44:49 I learned and I was, I learned this and I was like, yep, makes total sense.
00:44:55 Inscription was made by the same guys that made Pony Island.
00:44:59 Do you remember Pony Island?
00:45:00 I remember us hearing about it.
00:45:02 Pony Island sucks.
00:45:04 Pony Island was an idiot game made by rubes for babies.
00:45:08 It's got the same sort of general premise, doesn't it?
00:45:12 It's got a surface level game and then a sub game that is secret and mysterious and ooh,
00:45:17 you got to find the clues.
00:45:19 A little.
00:45:20 I mean, I'll be honest.
00:45:22 Aesthetically similar.
00:45:24 It is aesthetically similar in ways that I feel like it's.
00:45:31 I'd want to not spoil anything about it.
00:45:33 I still haven't gotten to whatever big spoiler there is.
00:45:36 There are some thematic and like meta-fictional similarities between Pony Island and inscription
00:45:45 in a way that makes me go like, yep, I totally see how the same guy made them.
00:45:51 But it's funny.
00:45:52 There are some things that I think are a little dumb about inscription.
00:45:59 And those are the things that made Pony Island really dumb and made me hate it.
00:46:07 So I don't know.
00:46:08 I just thought that was made me nod and go, yep, I see it.
00:46:12 Yep.
00:46:13 I see it.
00:46:14 I think fundamentally in a game what I like is having all the pieces to the puzzle.
00:46:22 I love puzzles.
00:46:23 I love point and click adventure games where I can have all of the items in my inventory
00:46:27 and try and think what I need to do.
00:46:30 And the most frustrating thing in a point and click adventure game is not having clicked
00:46:35 on something that doesn't look like you can click on it or like I thought I already did
00:46:39 and you didn't have a piece to the puzzle that is the piece you need.
00:46:42 That's the most annoying thing.
00:46:45 Yeah.
00:46:46 And so when I feel like when I start a new inscription game, I'm like, well, I lost,
00:46:50 but like, I don't know how to proceed.
00:46:55 I guess I will just, like, I don't know.
00:47:00 I just feel like I don't know all the time.
00:47:02 I don't feel like I'm getting better by losing.
00:47:07 I feel like, well, I don't, obviously I will.
00:47:09 You don't feel like you're getting better by losing?
00:47:10 I feel like I will eventually, but it's the sort of thing where I need to die like 50
00:47:13 times before I'm like, okay.
00:47:16 Okay.
00:47:17 I'm not smart.
00:47:19 I'm not smart like that.
00:47:21 You have, you have not made it past the Angler?
00:47:24 No.
00:47:25 Okay.
00:47:26 I fought them like maybe five times.
00:47:28 There's not that many.
00:47:29 That's not that, that's not, that's not very many.
00:47:32 No.
00:47:33 I died, I died a lot more than five times against the next big guy after the Angler.
00:47:41 So, I have a lot of, I have a lot of patience.
00:47:49 I have a lot of patience for stuff.
00:47:51 You know, the fact that like I felt like I was learning something every time I played
00:47:57 Inscription really like made it not that painful to lose.
00:48:01 I mean, when there was a run that I felt like, yeah, I lost it because I just didn't draw
00:48:05 what I wanted to or the game just didn't give me like good map choices.
00:48:11 And it didn't give me the choices that I wanted to build the deck that I wanted to build.
00:48:15 I did have runs like that.
00:48:17 And yeah, those are really frustrating and discouraging.
00:48:19 But I don't know.
00:48:21 I guess most runs, usually there was something I could be like, oh, okay.
00:48:25 Well, at least now I know not to do that or like, oh, well now I know that if I do that
00:48:30 it's good or I should keep my eye out for this in the future.
00:48:34 I think it was, it was just like, I got a bit of a bad first impression of what the cards
00:48:41 in the game were like, because Gek was like the first rare card I got after beating the
00:48:46 Prospector for the first time.
00:48:48 And Gek costs nothing.
00:48:50 And that led me to believe that sometimes cards can cost nothing.
00:48:54 And so I was always disappointed when a card cost anything.
00:48:57 I'm like, dang it.
00:48:59 How do I play this?
00:49:01 My deck was full of things that need, like I'm always low on like, bones and blood.
00:49:07 And I don't know how to make that be better.
00:49:11 I mean, well, you made a death card out of Gek with a zero cost, right?
00:49:17 I haven't seen him.
00:49:19 Oh, unlucky.
00:49:21 Do the death cards stay even after you die multiple times?
00:49:26 Yeah.
00:49:27 Oh, well, I guess I have been unlucky.
00:49:29 Which is, it's a mixed blessing though, because if you make a really good one, then like, you
00:49:34 aren't guaranteed to see it in the next game.
00:49:36 It might not come up for a while.
00:49:38 And like, as you make more death cards, like, you know, the pool gets diluted.
00:49:43 So if you have a really, if you have a really shitty run, you might have really shitty cards
00:49:47 and make a really shitty death card.
00:49:49 There's like five cards called Fuck You already.
00:49:54 You usually death, usually you can make a pretty good death card there.
00:50:02 Death cards tend to be better than normal cards.
00:50:05 Yeah, I remember like one of my first death cards, it was like a zero cost, like four, six,
00:50:11 with like double strike.
00:50:13 That's amazing.
00:50:14 Yeah.
00:50:15 And then I got it like the next run and I was like, I'm kicking ass with this.
00:50:19 I'm invincible.
00:50:21 But then because I kept making more death cards, it got rarer and rarer for me to see that one.
00:50:26 I was like, no, I want that one.
00:50:28 Just give me that one.
00:50:29 I could win with that one.
00:50:31 Well, that's super discouraging then, because I'm going to die like way more than the average player.
00:50:36 But the other death cards, the other death cards are also good.
00:50:39 They might not all be as like, as broken as that one.
00:50:42 But like, in general, they're pretty good.
00:50:46 You can you can pretty much always make a card that's better than like baseline.
00:50:52 I guess that's true.
00:50:54 I never picked Gek.
00:50:57 I never picked Gek because it's like, what do you it's like it's just a one one.
00:51:02 Like what do you what do you want that for?
00:51:07 I did I realized that like, yeah, it's it's humble.
00:51:12 But if you can boost it and it can become very valuable because it's free.
00:51:16 I mean, I know the value of a one one when like, you just need to do one damage to stop something from killing you.
00:51:25 And the fact that it's free means that like, I could always play it no matter what's happening unless my board is full.
00:51:31 Yeah, like the low cost is really useful.
00:51:34 It is I've realized the value of Gek, but I don't yeah, I don't think I ever played it as I was like working towards getting my first win.
00:51:42 Just because I was like the stats just aren't very the stats aren't very high.
00:51:49 No, but a free a free a free cast is like actually really good, especially if you are like having like pay if you're like running out of blood.
00:51:59 Like if you're if you're having blood struggles and like you can't pay for anything, then a free cast is like, OK, that gives you one turn where you can basically like get to blood in one turn.
00:52:13 And that's good.
00:52:15 That's really good if you want blood blood.
00:52:25 I've been playing a little bit of Casey's Mod just here and there, not as much as before.
00:52:31 I'm almost I think I've almost like 100% like beat everything that like Casey's Mod has to offer, not quite, but I'm pretty close.
00:52:46 What have been going for an hour?
00:52:48 54 minutes.
00:52:49 50 minutes.
00:52:50 OK.
00:52:54 I don't know.
00:52:59 Wow.
00:53:00 How are we so bad at doing a podcast after all these years after all these episodes?
00:53:05 Well, I mean, it's just because same reason I'm same reason I'm just bad at everything.
00:53:12 Same reason that I just suck in general is that I just don't do enough to talk to have things to talk about.
00:53:21 True.
00:53:22 True.
00:53:24 Oh, I guess I could talk about this, although it's a little it's not that personal, but it's like it's vocal training, like voice feminization.
00:53:35 Sure.
00:53:37 I've been avoiding it because it's sort of weirdly like scary and frustrating just in concept.
00:53:48 I've looked into it a little bit here and there and I'm like, do these exercises for like four months and eventually you might start to sense something is different.
00:53:58 And yeah, I think I want to do it.
00:54:03 I'm going to try my best to do some stuff.
00:54:08 Every day like larynx raising exercises and going or whatever you do and stuff like that.
00:54:21 But I think the most frustrating thing about it based on what little I've done so far is that I have no idea if I'm doing it right because it's hard to judge that when I'm listening to a YouTube video do it.
00:54:37 I try to copy it and they just don't go into enough depth as to what it sounds like when you're doing it wrong.
00:54:43 What it sounds like when you're not doing it right.
00:54:46 What it sounds like when you know how it should feel like I just need more information.
00:54:51 Well, you just got it.
00:54:52 You just got to lose.
00:54:53 You just got to lose and learn what you did wrong.
00:54:59 I got to lose over and over again.
00:55:01 I got to trial and error it.
00:55:03 I guess.
00:55:04 I don't know.
00:55:05 I hate that so much.
00:55:07 Yeah.
00:55:09 Yeah.
00:55:11 Yeah.
00:55:18 Well, what do you just like just starting that?
00:55:21 I mean, I'm not doing anything at the moment.
00:55:24 Like how I'm speaking now is just how I'm speaking normally anyway.
00:55:30 And I think over months and years, I've naturally spoken a little higher than I used to.
00:55:39 I think some people have noticed if you go back to older PCPs, I did speak with a lot more bass in my voice.
00:55:48 But I still, I don't sound like that feminine.
00:55:53 I don't think I want to do something about that.
00:55:57 And it's really, it's really, I don't know, it's just hard to approach because it's one thing is that it's difficult to stick with something when I don't know whether I'm doing it right or not.
00:56:12 I just have to trust that whatever exercises I'm doing are not stupid and I'm fine.
00:56:18 And eventually I'll see some results, but also making silly noises and trying to sound feminine makes me feel like an absolute fool.
00:56:28 And it's sort of embarrassing even when I'm by myself.
00:56:32 Yeah, I understand.
00:56:35 It's like some gender weirdness.
00:56:39 But I want to try it.
00:56:41 I want to try and get better at that.
00:56:43 It's just like going to the gym when you're a scrawny weakling and it's like, oh, it's so embarrassing.
00:56:49 I'm so weak.
00:56:52 I look like such a loser lifting the bar with no plates on it.
00:56:59 All the beef cakes are going to make fun of me.
00:57:04 And then they do.
00:57:09 That's the worst part.
00:57:11 The worst part is that it's true. It's all true. All the worst things you imagine.
00:57:21 So I'm not going to talk about it every week because I don't want it to be like a running like, how's your voice this week?
00:57:27 How's your voice stupid?
00:57:29 I don't want to do anything like make a big deal of it.
00:57:33 But hopefully, slowly and surely, I will sound more femme in my regular speech.
00:57:41 I suppose it remains to be seen.
00:57:45 Oh, I did watch the evermore video.
00:57:48 I forgot what you said about it last time.
00:57:51 Yeah, it's good.
00:57:52 It's good.
00:57:53 Yeah, it's good.
00:57:54 It's good.
00:57:55 It's a good video.
00:57:56 Interesting.
00:57:59 I don't know.
00:58:02 Yeah, what else can I say?
00:58:04 The Vampire Diaries video hit 10 million views.
00:58:08 Yeah, I saw that actually.
00:58:10 It's been recommended.
00:58:12 Oh, you saw it recommend.
00:58:14 I saw she made an announcement for about 10 million views on Twitter.
00:58:19 That's a lot of views.
00:58:21 That's a lot of views.
00:58:23 That's a lot of views.
00:58:25 I don't know if you've seen that one.
00:58:27 I mean, it's good.
00:58:29 I think I clicked on it once and I didn't know anything about Vampire Diaries.
00:58:33 Yeah.
00:58:34 And I was like, maybe I don't care.
00:58:36 Maybe I'm gone.
00:58:37 How long is that video?
00:58:38 Like two hours?
00:58:39 It's hours.
00:58:40 It's not even that long.
00:58:42 No.
00:58:43 Evermore is longer.
00:58:45 Yeah, but Evermore gripped me.
00:58:47 I know what the medieval fantasy is and the idea of a park doing all that stuff.
00:58:52 Wow, that's so cool and imaginative.
00:58:56 There's no way it could go right.
00:58:58 The Evermore one, it's really uncomfortable.
00:59:04 Especially the parts where they're like,
00:59:06 what really stuck out to me is the parts about the actors being way too intimate with the guests
00:59:14 and the sort of live-action role-playing element being way too personal.
00:59:20 I thought it was the other way around, the guests were being too personal with the actors.
00:59:26 I remember there's the part where that one podcaster,
00:59:32 that Evermore podcaster is kneeling before that one woman
00:59:36 and the woman is yelling at some other actor who's playing her husband or whatever
00:59:42 and she's like, what would you have me do, my lord?
00:59:44 Would you have me go to bed with him?
00:59:46 And it's like, is this like a kid's theme park?
00:59:50 There's a lot of incongruity with the subject matter being dark fantasy D&D
00:59:56 and a family outing place.
00:59:58 It doesn't really work.
01:00:00 It's just very uncomfortable.
01:00:04 Remarkable stuff, though.
01:00:08 Um...
01:00:10 Uh...
01:00:13 I um...
01:00:15 It makes me wish that I had more autistic hyper fixations.
01:00:21 Oh yeah, they're fun. It's fun to have those.
01:00:24 Yeah, I wish I felt some sort of compulsion to pursue some extremely niche interests
01:00:37 so that I would have some very obscure facts to turn into content.
01:00:43 That would be cool.
01:00:44 Do you not have that in obscure weirdo webcomics?
01:00:49 Not really. I mean, I know a few of them, but I'm not out here discovering more very often.
01:00:57 I mean, I guess I could.
01:00:59 Maybe.
01:01:01 Has it turned out that Ben Saint is the least autistic of the PCP and he regrets it terribly?
01:01:07 As I've said before, my brain does work.
01:01:13 But to what end?
01:01:16 I'm pretty sure I'm neurotypical as far as I'm aware.
01:01:21 You've got a normal head on your shoulders and you're sad constantly.
01:01:25 It's a classic tale.
01:01:27 And it's just not doing me any favors, man.
01:01:31 It's not working. Something's got to change.
01:01:37 You've got to go down the neurotypical path and become a landlord or something.
01:01:42 You've got to get six figures and then drink wine and go to the football.
01:01:52 I mean, I guess those are things that some people do.
01:01:56 I associate having lots of money with being neurotypical.
01:01:59 With having lots of things neurotypical people do.
01:02:02 Watch football, drink wine and have lots of money.
01:02:08 Yeah.
01:02:10 They have like a pad and they have a barbecue and they invite their normal friends over.
01:02:15 Different kinds of neurotypical people do all of those things in different measures, I suppose.
01:02:24 I should have just stayed in academia.
01:02:29 I should have just gotten my PhD or something.
01:02:34 That's what should have happened.
01:02:38 Is that impossible to go back and do that?
01:02:41 It's not impossible now.
01:02:45 I mean, I guess I could do that.
01:02:47 It's daunting. It's hard.
01:02:51 Even then, I would be faced with the, well, what are you going to write your thesis on?
01:02:55 I would say, I don't know.
01:02:57 Nothing matters, man.
01:03:00 I don't care about anything.
01:03:04 So it's truly, I'm truly doomed.
01:03:10 No matter what.
01:03:14 Do you let yourself get vulnerable a lot?
01:03:18 What does that mean?
01:03:20 Putting yourself up with, I don't know, like vulnerable facts.
01:03:27 Like in general?
01:03:30 Yeah. I feel like a lot of creativity comes from vulnerability.
01:03:36 Like putting yourself out there in a way that you would feel cringe about or otherwise be afraid of people knowing.
01:03:47 Um...
01:03:52 Are you a closed off individual, Ben Saint?
01:03:57 Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, I guess a little bit, yeah.
01:04:01 Yeah, I feel like that would be a good place to start if you want to start feeling stuff.
01:04:06 I don't even know how I would do that.
01:04:13 It's a little difficult.
01:04:16 I've recently learned a good way to understand yourself like that is to think of what truly terrifies you,
01:04:25 but where the consequences are not actually life-threatening.
01:04:29 Like for an example, I am scared of wearing a dress.
01:04:37 For example, this is a gender thing. I'm scared of being judged for it.
01:04:41 Wearing a dress is not going to do anything bad, so my fear is not in the dress itself.
01:04:46 It's the vulnerability, you know, the sincerity with which I present myself and the judgment that could come from that.
01:04:54 That's where the fear comes from is being vulnerable.
01:04:58 And so when you're afraid of opening up about something, like really afraid,
01:05:06 it's probably because that's something that you really want, sort of an innate sort of feeling.
01:05:13 And that's how you know if you think about how you feel about things.
01:05:18 That's how you would be able to point to something and say,
01:05:20 okay, I probably want to do that, and then you could pursue it.
01:05:25 Hmm, okay, okay.
01:05:33 Just a thought.
01:05:34 Thinking, all right, all right.
01:05:38 I'll process that a little and get back to you, I guess.
01:05:46 One of those things, I mean, I felt very like open more recently.
01:05:51 It's been nice.
01:05:53 Let's see, you're having a good time on Twitter.
01:05:56 Yeah.
01:05:59 Imagine that.
01:06:01 Yeah, it's hard.
01:06:03 It's hard to understand.
01:06:09 Oh, well.
01:06:10 Kill the part of you that cringes, et cetera.
01:06:13 Yeah, yeah.
01:06:18 All right, let's just go to voicemails.
01:06:21 God, I gotta fucking download them.
01:06:26 No, it's not voicemail.com, it's speakpipe.com.
01:06:31 Slash PCP voicemail, right?
01:06:35 Yes.
01:06:37 Leave us a voicemail if you got something to say that nothing comes out when they move the lips.
01:06:43 Just a bunch of gibberish.
01:06:45 They forgot about Dre.
01:06:47 Okay.
01:06:50 Dre Lamau.
01:06:52 Let's see.
01:06:54 There's a message here.
01:06:56 It said mjirlink, what do we got?
01:06:58 Hang on, which page are we on?
01:07:01 Page one.
01:07:03 Oh, my God.
01:07:06 This is cool.
01:07:08 Regiflex.
01:07:09 Regiflex.
01:07:11 See, this works.
01:07:14 Although, what's different about this versus normal type?
01:07:18 Like, what isn't normal type?
01:07:20 Do normal types not have muscles?
01:07:22 The way I understand normal type is, like, thematically, they are critters who are not jacked.
01:07:33 That's a little scrawny.
01:07:35 That's so unscientific.
01:07:36 I know.
01:07:37 Pokemon is weirdly, well, not weirdly, it's like, it's not scientific.
01:07:41 It tries to be in some things, but a lot of it is just sort of like vibes.
01:07:46 There's no real difference.
01:07:48 It's true.
01:07:49 It's too vibe-based.
01:07:51 It's too vibe-based for me.
01:07:53 Fighting beats normal because fighting is the Chad and normal is the Virgin.
01:07:58 It's the Virgin.
01:07:59 That makes sense.
01:08:01 I can understand that dynamic easily.
01:08:05 I'm trying to think, what is fighting weak against?
01:08:09 It is weak against psychic.
01:08:10 No, it's not weak against dark.
01:08:12 It's strong against dark.
01:08:14 It's weak against psychic.
01:08:15 It's weak against flying and fairy.
01:08:18 I think that's it.
01:08:19 Yeah.
01:08:20 It's funny how normal is not weak against flying, even though the assumption you would make is
01:08:26 that fighting is on the ground.
01:08:28 They're strong muscles, but they're not able to attack something that's like dive-bombing them.
01:08:33 But normal is also on the ground.
01:08:35 It's also on the ground.
01:08:36 It's just weaker.
01:08:37 Yeah.
01:08:38 But they're fine, actually.
01:08:41 Yeah, it's a bit shit, I guess I would say.
01:08:48 Hang on.
01:08:49 Are there more pictures in this album, or is it just the one?
01:08:51 It's just the one.
01:08:53 I think?
01:08:54 I'm double-checking.
01:08:55 Yeah, it's just the one.
01:08:56 Okay.
01:08:57 Okay.
01:08:58 Well, let's check the next one.
01:09:03 It's another Imgur link.
01:09:05 Oh boy, what could it be?
01:09:08 Yeah.
01:09:10 Yeah, I'm a cuck, crazy, unhinged cop killer.
01:09:17 I like that they're using a pretty normal photo of you, but your teeth are gold.
01:09:24 My teeth are gold, yeah.
01:09:27 I got that sinister red glint in my one eye.
01:09:33 This rules.
01:09:34 This owns, I don't know.
01:09:37 Yeah.
01:09:38 Yeah.
01:09:39 All I can do is say how I appreciate it for being good, and that's what's happening.
01:09:47 Next one is called Two Best Friends.
01:09:52 Three, two, one, go.
01:09:55 Hey Ben, would you say Gibb is your best friend?
01:09:58 Same to you, Gibb.
01:09:59 Would you say Ben is your best friend?
01:10:02 Don't put us on the spot like that.
01:10:07 You're definitely a very good friend.
01:10:09 Yeah.
01:10:10 I mean, do I have to choose between you and every other friend that I have?
01:10:15 Yeah, it's not, best friend is, it's a very like, like child, like term.
01:10:22 Like when you're on the playground, you have like a bunch of people you like, but there's
01:10:26 one that you like most, and that's your best friend.
01:10:29 Your best friend, yeah.
01:10:30 But that's only because when you're at school, that is your entire world.
01:10:35 You don't really go other places and meet different groups of friends in other places.
01:10:38 I would say that like a best friend implies that like you're together like a lot, like
01:10:43 you hang out like a lot of the time.
01:10:45 Yeah.
01:10:46 I don't really have any one.
01:10:48 Essentially.
01:10:49 Yeah.
01:10:50 But like, you know, I mean, we don't, I mean, do podcasts once a week.
01:10:55 I don't know.
01:10:56 To me, a best friend is like you're over like every day.
01:10:58 Yeah.
01:10:59 You're over every day, you know, drinking wine, watching the, going to the football game.
01:11:04 And having lots of money together.
01:11:06 And then talking about your properties you own.
01:11:09 My dad has a best friend.
01:11:11 Like him and his best friend since childhood, you know, they like, they own a boat together.
01:11:18 They go sailing together.
01:11:20 And like, you know, they're like, they're like peas in a pod, like lifelong chums.
01:11:27 There's a quite a number of people.
01:11:31 I would never own a boat with you.
01:11:33 I'm sorry.
01:11:34 No, that's fine.
01:11:35 There's plenty of people in my life that I would consider very good friends, but no one
01:11:40 single one that is like a pea in a pod situation.
01:11:43 Yeah.
01:11:44 I do like to keep to myself quite a lot.
01:11:46 Yeah.
01:11:47 Yeah.
01:11:48 Okay.
01:11:49 Well, I'm glad we're, it would be so awkward if I was like, nah, not really.
01:11:52 And you were like, yeah, absolutely.
01:11:54 How much would that suck?
01:11:58 Yeah.
01:11:59 Okay.
01:12:00 I'm glad we're on the same page.
01:12:01 Next one is listen first bonus meme days.
01:12:05 How shower you long without.
01:12:08 Okay.
01:12:09 Three, two, one, go.
01:12:11 Ben saying keeps on saying, ah, the eight hour mega man feed is the other mega man feed.
01:12:17 Where is it?
01:12:18 Where is it?
01:12:19 Give it to me.
01:12:20 I want the mega man eight hour video.
01:12:23 Is it, is it even real?
01:12:26 Is it in the room with you, Ben?
01:12:29 This guy.
01:12:30 This guy is having.
01:12:31 It literally is.
01:12:32 It is what?
01:12:33 Real?
01:12:34 No, he said like, is it in the room with us?
01:12:36 Like, yes, it literally is.
01:12:37 It's in the room with you.
01:12:38 It kind of is.
01:12:39 It's on your little computer there.
01:12:40 On my little computer here.
01:12:43 This guy's having the appropriate reaction.
01:12:46 More people should be yelling at me about it not being out.
01:12:50 Everyone's just much too polite.
01:12:53 Mega polite.
01:12:54 Mega.
01:12:55 But I did, I did, I did already, I did already say what's up with it.
01:12:59 So I won't go into it again.
01:13:01 Days how shower long you without depends.
01:13:06 I mean, I'll be, I'll be honest if I'm not going out, if I'm not leaving my house or
01:13:11 seeing anyone, I will just not shower because like, what does it matter?
01:13:18 So sometimes I go a little while, but I don't, but I don't let myself be seen in
01:13:23 that state.
01:13:24 No, absolutely.
01:13:25 I'm going out.
01:13:27 It's time to scrub.
01:13:29 Yeah.
01:13:30 I think I go like maybe two days though without showering just because my hair needs to be
01:13:38 wetted and it's just the easiest way to do that.
01:13:42 I mean, otherwise it gets way too frizzy.
01:13:46 I don't wash it every, every shower, but I need to wet it every few days.
01:13:52 They say it's like, they say it's like bad for your hair to wash it too much.
01:13:56 Yeah.
01:13:57 You wash all of the natural occur naturally occurring oils out of your hair.
01:14:01 The point of washing your hair is to get rid of all the dirt that's accumulated, not to
01:14:05 get rid of the oil because that's, that's important.
01:14:08 So, so they say that's what the conditioner is to replace the oil, replace the oil while
01:14:16 your natural oil comes back.
01:14:18 Right.
01:14:19 Yeah.
01:14:20 That's what they say.
01:14:24 A shampoo conditioner is a scam because like the point of the shampoo is that it strips
01:14:31 the, it strips the oil off.
01:14:33 So, like, it doesn't make any sense to like have, oh, a thing that puts oil on the hair,
01:14:38 but also the shampoo that strips it off.
01:14:41 Yeah, it just doesn't seem to do much.
01:14:44 Yeah.
01:14:45 All right.
01:14:46 The next one is another Imgur album.
01:14:49 Oh, it's another, I think someone sent the same thing last week.
01:14:55 Vat of slime in the new Sonic.
01:14:57 I mean, it looks pretty cool.
01:14:59 I haven't seen this last week.
01:15:00 This maybe is a discord or something you saw.
01:15:03 Maybe, maybe it was.
01:15:04 Yeah.
01:15:05 No, no, no, I think it was on discord.
01:15:06 Someone sent me this.
01:15:07 It wasn't this same picture, but it was a picture of one of these tanks in the new Sonic.
01:15:13 Looks like pretty good slime.
01:15:15 Pretty slimy.
01:15:16 Pretty slimy.
01:15:17 Pretty nuclear.
01:15:18 Damn, look at that.
01:15:19 Look at that reflection in the, in the ground.
01:15:23 I've heard the Sonic game is pretty empty and kind of janky.
01:15:29 I have, I haven't seen that much talk about it.
01:15:33 The little talk that I have seen has been like people being like, ooh, should I get cautiously
01:15:39 optimistic?
01:15:40 Oh, should I be cautiously optimistic about the release of this game?
01:15:43 Since the release, I've seen people saying like, yeah, it's bad law.
01:15:48 Whoops.
01:15:49 Yeah.
01:15:50 Yeah.
01:15:51 Breath of the Mild.
01:15:52 I'm sure that's been done.
01:15:53 Oof.
01:15:54 Oof.
01:15:55 Oh, right.
01:15:56 It's open world, right?
01:15:57 That's like the thing about it.
01:15:58 Yeah.
01:15:59 What if you could go in every direction and, and it was not a curated experience?
01:16:09 Or at least not as curated.
01:16:12 Oh, I think that, I think the same person also sent another slime that they just, they just
01:16:20 sent two of them.
01:16:23 Let's, let's take a look.
01:16:25 Oh yeah.
01:16:27 Now we're talking.
01:16:30 Oh, it looks so small.
01:16:33 Yeah.
01:16:34 I think the back stone there, I thought was like a curb and then there was dirt and this
01:16:40 was like a little 3D model that had been 3D printed, but then that's in game and that's
01:16:44 real Sonic.
01:16:45 Yeah.
01:16:46 This looks like, this looks like we're looking at like one foot of space here and Sonic is
01:16:50 like an inch tall.
01:16:52 It's something very toy like about it.
01:16:56 Um, I just be like the consistency of the dirt.
01:17:00 Like that just looks like any rough dirt.
01:17:03 It's like, it looks like a little garden patch.
01:17:07 Anyway, uh, next one is called Manchigo Mitch.
01:17:12 Uh, three, two, one, go.
01:17:16 Hey, it's me, Manchigo Mitch.
01:17:20 Yes, another beloved character.
01:17:22 Fredo, you owe us money and you know what's going to happen if you don't pay an artist
01:17:27 the money, we're going to draw your kneecaps broken.
01:17:31 We're going to artistically render your kneecaps broken.
01:17:35 If you don't pay us the money.
01:17:37 No, that would be so embarrassing.
01:17:39 Capiche.
01:17:41 That's a very, that's a Chris Chan threat.
01:17:45 I like that.
01:17:47 The only two examples were the same example of the kneecaps.
01:17:50 I mean, what else?
01:17:52 I mean, what else?
01:17:53 We're going to break your kneecaps in drawn form and we're also going to paint them drawn
01:17:57 kneecaps broken.
01:18:00 This is, this is like a Chris Chan threat.
01:18:02 If you make Chris mad, she'll like put you in the comic and draw you being executed
01:18:06 by firing squad.
01:18:09 And you don't want that, do you?
01:18:11 Uh-oh.
01:18:13 Uh, next one is called Paneer Pauly.
01:18:16 Three, two, one, go.
01:18:18 Where is my money, Cheesy Manfredo?
01:18:20 Yep, yep, yep.
01:18:22 That's right, it's me, Paneer Pauly.
01:18:25 I'm with the mozzarella mafia and you owe us money.
01:18:28 I don't know what the words mean.
01:18:30 Paneer is a cheese.
01:18:32 Let me tell you what we're going to do to you.
01:18:35 We're going to take you.
01:18:37 We're going to age you.
01:18:39 We're going to stick you on a shelf.
01:18:41 We're going to flip you over for six months.
01:18:43 And then in six months time, you'll be six months older.
01:18:46 See how you like that.
01:18:48 No.
01:18:50 Twice before you screw us over again.
01:18:52 Out.
01:18:54 Paneer Pauly, out.
01:18:58 God.
01:19:00 We're going to age you.
01:19:02 We're going to put you in a meat smoking rack.
01:19:07 You're going to get fucking smoked.
01:19:10 Terrifying, terrifying.
01:19:12 Don't fuck with these guys.
01:19:14 You better get them their money is what I'm picking up.
01:19:17 Uh, next one is called Return of the Kring Us.
01:19:22 Three, two, one, go.
01:19:26 What's a PCP?
01:19:28 It's me.
01:19:30 Kring is the third.
01:19:33 I cringed at the cheesy for making a cringe kick starter.
01:19:41 And now I'm banging cyberpunk edge runners and chainsaw man.
01:19:50 They're very good.
01:19:54 Cool, man.
01:19:56 Keep, keep biggin.
01:19:59 Keep on biggin.
01:20:02 I think I might have mentioned last week that I mean to read chainsaw man at some point.
01:20:08 I still haven't done it.
01:20:10 It's the big zeitgeist anime of the moment.
01:20:13 You got to do it.
01:20:14 It's the moment anime.
01:20:16 I guess that I hate the moment.
01:20:18 I'll wait until it's not popular anymore and maybe then I'll read it.
01:20:22 Uh, cyberpunk edge runners, I have no interest in.
01:20:26 I mean, I didn't play the game.
01:20:28 I've heard that it's good.
01:20:30 I mean, everyone hated the game, but people say the anime is good.
01:20:33 So I'm sure that's fine.
01:20:35 I'm sure me not playing the game would be no impediment to me enjoying it.
01:20:39 I'm a little confused.
01:20:41 I haven't looked into it at all.
01:20:43 So the cyberpunk 2077 is different from whatever the anime is based on?
01:20:47 Well, 77 is the game.
01:20:49 The edge runner is, I think, I don't think it's, I'm not sure if it's like the same characters,
01:20:55 but I know it's set in the same world.
01:20:57 That's pretty much all I know about it.
01:20:59 But is it also a game?
01:21:01 No, it's an anime.
01:21:03 No, it's an anime.
01:21:05 But like, is so people are playing the cyberpunk game?
01:21:10 No.
01:21:12 They're watching the anime called edge runners.
01:21:15 But edge runners has a game?
01:21:17 I thought it did.
01:21:19 Cyberpunk 77 was the game.
01:21:21 And then cyberpunk edge runners is the anime.
01:21:25 Spin off, I guess?
01:21:29 Spin off, I guess.
01:21:31 Spin off? Well, spin off, King.
01:21:35 But I don't know.
01:21:37 It doesn't look great.
01:21:39 Nothing about it appeals to me much.
01:21:41 So I'm probably not going to watch it.
01:21:43 Next one is Im...
01:21:46 It's another freaking Imjurling.
01:21:48 Wait a minute, did I download that last one?
01:21:50 Yes, I did.
01:21:54 Let's post the link, boy.
01:21:56 Let's do it.
01:21:59 Ew.
01:22:01 Oh, it's Ben Garrison.
01:22:03 It's Ben Garrison.
01:22:05 Oh, my God.
01:22:07 There's a little Ben Saint on there.
01:22:10 Hey, this is great.
01:22:13 Hey, this rules.
01:22:15 Endless War is...
01:22:17 Slimecorp is squeezing the teats of Endless War to get slime.
01:22:21 Yep, I mean, yeah, that's...
01:22:23 The slime cow.
01:22:25 The slime cow.
01:22:29 This is amazing. This is fantastic.
01:22:31 Yeah, it's so true.
01:22:33 It's so true, it's so true.
01:22:35 It's sad but true.
01:22:38 This is our society when you think about it.
01:22:45 Scary. Look at his scary face.
01:22:47 Oh, my God.
01:22:49 Oh, there's dollars. Look, there's a couple of bucks.
01:22:51 There's a couple of bucks.
01:22:53 Oh, there's dollars underneath the slime in the bucket as well.
01:22:57 Oh, yeah.
01:22:59 Oh, yeah. Slime is money.
01:23:01 Slime is money, as they say.
01:23:03 Yep.
01:23:05 I hope I never said that before.
01:23:07 Next one is...
01:23:11 Oh, God.
01:23:15 Endless War says map, right?
01:23:19 Why did... Oh, because you retweeted it as Endless War.
01:23:23 Right. This was...
01:23:25 KillerDog tweeted this in response to JK Rowling,
01:23:29 which was really funny.
01:23:32 I like this response a lot,
01:23:34 so I retweeted it on a bunch of different accounts.
01:23:40 Endless War liked it.
01:23:42 Endless War liked it and retweeted it.
01:23:44 That's an endorsement.
01:23:46 Retweets are endorsements.
01:23:50 It's funny. It's good.
01:23:52 No apologies.
01:23:54 Ben's Weekly Reminder, play Delta in Chapter 2.
01:23:57 Okay. Ben's Weekly Reminder, catch up to one piece.
01:24:00 Okay. Wait, was it last week that I said that I actually should do that,
01:24:03 so we could talk about it on the show?
01:24:05 Yeah, it was.
01:24:07 We could talk a little bit about that one piece as a corner,
01:24:12 as a little corner of the podcast.
01:24:14 Yeah. I was right that I should do that,
01:24:17 but nevertheless, I didn't.
01:24:20 But soon, perhaps, I should...
01:24:25 Maybe this week I'll do it, if I don't forget.
01:24:28 It's on my to-do list.
01:24:32 Next one is called You, 3, 2, 1, go.
01:24:59 I mean...
01:25:01 I wonder who he's owing it to.
01:25:03 Is it us?
01:25:05 Yeah, it's the PCP, so it's the time of your life.
01:25:08 Oh, well, I'm glad you had the time of your life watching the PCP.
01:25:11 Every single week you have the time of your life, right here,
01:25:14 on the Procrastinators podcast.
01:25:17 I know I'm having the time of my life.
01:25:20 Yeah, because my life is being timed.
01:25:25 My life is passing me by, so I'm having time of my life taken.
01:25:29 No, is it?
01:25:30 Okay, all spoilers.
01:25:31 Favorite character from inscription?
01:25:33 Oh, the butler.
01:25:35 The penguin.
01:25:37 I have an answer, but...
01:25:40 Can you speak in tongues so I don't understand?
01:25:43 How can I say it?
01:25:46 Okay.
01:25:48 No, I can't really say that.
01:25:50 That would give too much away.
01:25:52 It's the big green monster.
01:25:57 With the teeth.
01:26:01 It was you all along, the player.
01:26:03 You're the monster.
01:26:08 There's a dragon.
01:26:10 There's a little gremlin.
01:26:12 The blue one.
01:26:14 I know what that is.
01:26:16 That's a smurf.
01:26:17 That's all I'm saying.
01:26:18 My favorite one is the blue one, and I'm not going to explain why.
01:26:22 The game is run by little Jinjos from Banjo-Kazooie.
01:26:27 Okay, next one is called the funniest fart you've heard.
01:26:35 In the fart compilation where it made Jerma cry tears of pain from laughing so hard.
01:26:42 Sounds like it must have been a real humdinger.
01:26:45 He was trying to do like a bit while...
01:26:49 He was doing a bit where he's playing the part of a gym guy at the gym,
01:26:54 but he's got headphones in his ears, and headphones are blasting really loud music.
01:26:59 Somebody said, do a fart compilation, so he tried to act like the gym guy saying,
01:27:03 hey, you need a spotter?
01:27:05 But he's got the loudest fart compilation you've ever heard blasting out of his headphones
01:27:10 so the camera could pick it up, and he couldn't do it without laughing,
01:27:14 and he ended up crying on stream.
01:27:16 It was very, very, very funny.
01:27:18 Oh, sad. Oh, sad. Couldn't do it. Pitiful.
01:27:21 He tried. No, he got pretty far.
01:27:24 Cringe. I could have done it. I could have done it easily.
01:27:30 Okay, next one is, Ben, prove you are a good ally right now.
01:27:34 Give, give, a compliment.
01:27:42 His hesitation is saying so much.
01:27:46 It's too hard. It's too hard.
01:27:51 You can do it, Ben. You can be a good ally.
01:27:54 You don't want to get canceled, do you?
01:27:58 No, I don't, no, I don't want that, so...
01:28:03 What's, I mean, what's a good one?
01:28:06 That's a good one. God ask me.
01:28:08 Yeah, okay.
01:28:11 Give your, your very...
01:28:19 Try to think of a rule. Okay, you're, you're a...
01:28:22 You're, you're, you're very sincere.
01:28:25 You're very sincere with your, when you,
01:28:28 when you emote or express a feeling,
01:28:31 I just, it's very, it's, you always do it with sincerity,
01:28:35 and I think that's cool.
01:28:38 Well, thank you.
01:28:39 That's a good quality for a person to have, in my opinion.
01:28:42 Yes.
01:28:44 So there.
01:28:45 No, fuck you.
01:28:47 Next one is called, an idea.
01:28:49 Three, two, one, go.
01:29:08 Okay.
01:29:17 So a video of Ben jump-scaring Nate shitting his pants
01:29:21 is the way to get Nate back on the PCP.
01:29:24 Was, was that the point?
01:29:26 Is that this is how to get Nate back on the PCP?
01:29:28 Yeah, that's what they started with.
01:29:32 Oh, well, I mean, it would add him to the content
01:29:35 and that it would be a video of him being scared
01:29:37 to the point of pissing and shitting himself.
01:29:40 So, I mean, it, yeah, it would be against his will,
01:29:45 but I mean, it would work.
01:29:48 Yeah, I see no, I see no downsides.
01:29:51 I think he's cracked the code.
01:29:54 Oh, next, next one is called, another idea.
01:29:56 Three, two, one, go.
01:30:02 Put Ben in the walls.
01:30:04 Okay.
01:30:15 Oh, okay.
01:30:23 I mean, I think it would, I think it, I think it might work.
01:30:27 It's just crazy enough to work.
01:30:29 So a little plush of Brony Curious.
01:30:31 We need one of those.
01:30:33 Yeah, that's the part that's hard.
01:30:35 That's the part that might be impossible.
01:30:37 I don't think I've ever seen a fan made Brony Curious plush.
01:30:41 I do not recall such a thing.
01:30:45 Well, we'll just have to do it ourselves.
01:30:49 When life gives you lemons.
01:30:51 You make Brony Curious.
01:30:53 You make Brony Curious.
01:30:55 Next one is called, did I download that one?
01:30:57 No, I downloaded, last one I downloaded was 34.
01:31:03 So I got to download an idea and I got to download another idea.
01:31:08 Okay.
01:31:09 Next one is last very, very, very important idea.
01:31:11 Three, two, one, go.
01:31:12 Here is how we bring back all the other PCP members.
01:31:15 We don't.
01:31:16 Thank you.
01:31:17 Yeah.
01:31:22 I'm clapping.
01:31:23 Next one is called, at my wit's end, three, two, one, go.
01:31:28 It's insanity.
01:31:29 It's insanity.
01:31:30 How could anyone think the earth is around?
01:31:32 There's no evidence.
01:31:34 There's no proof.
01:31:37 He's right.
01:31:38 It sounds like you're at your wit's end.
01:31:40 There's no proof.
01:31:42 Oh, you've seen the curvature of the earth.
01:31:45 Yeah.
01:31:46 Well, how do you know?
01:31:47 How do you know that that picture?
01:31:49 What's the evidence that this picture is real?
01:31:51 You see, I like curvy women and so I get a bono whenever I look at the earth.
01:31:56 So, you know, that's my evidence.
01:31:58 What's the evidence that all those photographs of the earth from space showing it being round
01:32:03 are real?
01:32:04 Prove that those aren't just fake.
01:32:06 You can't.
01:32:07 Nobody can.
01:32:09 Oh, no.
01:32:12 How do I know?
01:32:13 I mean, how do I know that some demon is not living in my mind manipulating my brain in
01:32:18 order that I simply experience and see evidence of the roundness of the earth?
01:32:22 But how do I know that it's not just being manipulated by a malicious demon in my mind?
01:32:26 You can't do it.
01:32:29 Well, what if the demon isn't so bad after all?
01:32:33 No, he's bad.
01:32:35 No, he's bad because Democrats put him there.
01:32:38 That's the demon talking.
01:32:40 Your mind is compromised.
01:32:42 Your opinion of the demon is incorrect.
01:32:46 Exactly.
01:32:47 The demon would want you to think.
01:32:49 The demon wants you to think that it's good that he has made you want to get vaccinated
01:32:55 against the coronavirus.
01:32:57 He wants you to think that that's OK, even though it's clearly not.
01:33:03 Next one is called a real genuine voicemail.
01:33:06 Finally.
01:33:07 Wow.
01:33:08 Finally, a real voicemail.
01:33:09 Three, two, one, go.
01:33:16 We've been had.
01:33:17 He played on our expectations.
01:33:20 Fuck.
01:33:21 How could we have been so blind?
01:33:24 Is he going to twist at the end?
01:33:26 He's just clearing his throat.
01:33:27 Don't worry about it.
01:33:28 OK, no.
01:33:29 No.
01:33:30 Yeah, he's just clearing his throat.
01:33:31 He's just building up to like a really amazing.
01:33:34 Oh, no, it's over.
01:33:35 OK.
01:33:36 Next one is called me.
01:33:38 Three, two, one, go.
01:33:41 Do you think having a passion is necessary for a good life?
01:33:45 Yeah.
01:33:46 Yeah.
01:33:48 I mean, what else are you going to do if you don't have one?
01:33:51 You're just going to be miserable like me.
01:33:53 If you got all the time in the world and like money, passion is like what makes you feel
01:34:03 like doing anything.
01:34:05 Yeah.
01:34:06 So like, oh, you're really like pomegranates, got a passion for those, not passion fruit.
01:34:14 You got a passion for pomegranates.
01:34:16 So you wake up in the morning, you get yourself for pomegranate.
01:34:19 That's a passion.
01:34:20 That's something you would live for.
01:34:23 Hypothetically.
01:34:24 Just like in Hades.
01:34:28 Yeah.
01:34:29 Yeah.
01:34:30 That's why they use that.
01:34:31 Yeah.
01:34:32 Yeah.
01:34:34 If you don't have passion, then you'll be dispassionate about everything you do.
01:34:40 You could see every single fruit and you would just say whatever.
01:34:43 Yeah.
01:34:44 And that's not a life.
01:34:46 That's when you're a skeleton, you do that.
01:34:48 Yeah.
01:34:49 Because you can't eat them.
01:34:50 Yeah.
01:34:51 Yeah.
01:34:52 All right.
01:34:53 There we go.
01:34:54 Question answered.
01:34:56 This one is called VVV the comic.
01:34:59 It stands for Vinny VVV.
01:35:02 My favorite part of the week.
01:35:05 We'll see.
01:35:07 We'll see.
01:35:09 Okay.
01:35:10 Okay.
01:35:11 Okay.
01:35:12 So I'm playing the guitar.
01:35:13 You're playing the guitar.
01:35:14 My guitar.
01:35:15 I'm saying Ben.
01:35:16 Ben, you're vaping like a lot.
01:35:18 Ben.
01:35:19 It's too much.
01:35:20 I've missed making gummies with his ingredient.
01:35:24 I enjoyed for the first time in months.
01:35:29 I think it's 13 ingredient and I'm overjoyed for the first time in months.
01:35:34 Also, your teeth.
01:35:38 What are you doing?
01:35:39 I'm smiling.
01:35:40 I'm smiling so hard you can see my gums.
01:35:42 Oh my God.
01:35:43 I've never seen you smile before.
01:35:45 No.
01:35:46 You wouldn't have.
01:35:47 This is what it looks like.
01:35:49 Tragically.
01:35:50 Tragically.
01:35:51 Yeah.
01:35:52 Okay.
01:35:53 Okay.
01:35:54 And then we've got.
01:35:58 Shit.
01:35:59 Wait.
01:36:00 Who's the driver is?
01:36:03 Error.
01:36:04 Error.
01:36:05 Yes.
01:36:06 That's right.
01:36:07 That's right.
01:36:08 With the hogs.
01:36:09 Yes.
01:36:10 Ben expels a lot of vapor like a lot.
01:36:11 You good now?
01:36:12 Whoops.
01:36:13 That'll be your deposit.
01:36:14 Dang it.
01:36:15 What?
01:36:16 Just because I vaped a lot?
01:36:17 Just air it out.
01:36:18 You vaped so much that you dissolved the roof and it fell off.
01:36:23 Oh.
01:36:24 Bummer.
01:36:25 Bummer.
01:36:26 I'm not.
01:36:28 I'm not.
01:36:29 I'm nonplussed about this.
01:36:30 And I'm sad trombone.
01:36:31 Look at my face.
01:36:32 Look at my chin.
01:36:33 Look at that pig.
01:36:34 He's looking back.
01:36:35 He's blushing a little bit.
01:36:36 What's he thinking about?
01:36:37 I think he's embarrassed for me.
01:36:47 In the next one, are you holding a little pink mushroom?
01:36:52 I think that maybe I'm doing makeup.
01:36:54 I'm looking in a mirror.
01:36:55 Oh yeah.
01:36:56 Yeah.
01:36:57 You're.
01:36:58 Yes.
01:36:59 That's right.
01:37:00 Putting on eyeliner or something.
01:37:01 Yeah.
01:37:02 You can see it in the next one.
01:37:03 It's a mirror.
01:37:04 Oh.
01:37:05 And then what are you doing, Gib?
01:37:07 I'm drawing on my eyebrows.
01:37:09 Why are?
01:37:10 You melted them along with the roof.
01:37:12 You silly freaking billy.
01:37:14 Oh my bad.
01:37:15 I didn't mean to hurt you.
01:37:17 I wouldn't say that.
01:37:18 Fuck you.
01:37:19 It's so out of character.
01:37:20 Yeah.
01:37:21 I know.
01:37:22 And I'm not mad.
01:37:23 It's just the wind blowing on me causing me to put more effort into keeping it looking
01:37:27 good.
01:37:28 You do look good.
01:37:29 No.
01:37:30 You've done it.
01:37:35 You got him.
01:37:37 Thanks.
01:37:38 You made it look so easy being yourself and doing what feels natural.
01:37:42 Where is this going?
01:37:44 I do have to steal myself against my fear of rejection.
01:37:48 Rejection from society and all that.
01:37:50 Being myself in earnest and having that dismissed or thrown back in my face.
01:37:54 That hurts more than what it used to.
01:37:56 I'm going to throw up.
01:37:58 Yeah.
01:37:59 It's the choice to put it out there.
01:38:02 Oh God.
01:38:03 There's another panel like this after this.
01:38:05 I get it.
01:38:06 I respect the hell out of it.
01:38:07 I'm just kind of absorbing it.
01:38:09 The earnest vibe from you.
01:38:11 It's cool.
01:38:12 I wish I hadn't complimented you on being sincere.
01:38:17 I wish I'd picked something else.
01:38:20 Oh, okay.
01:38:22 The dialogue continues.
01:38:24 Oh, speaking of cool things.
01:38:26 I've been experimenting with some goth makeup styles.
01:38:29 Goth gib, huh?
01:38:31 Lol, yeah.
01:38:32 I haven't taken pics of myself.
01:38:34 It was just like things I've said or anything.
01:38:37 But I've been looking at different things I could do.
01:38:41 I love the goth look.
01:38:43 I never entertained the idea of buying makeup and doing it though.
01:38:47 I brought some makeup.
01:38:49 Would you be willing to let me put it on you?
01:38:52 Well, I wouldn't do that.
01:38:53 Yeah.
01:38:54 I've always wanted to look like a cool goth guy.
01:38:56 I've never had the confidence to do it.
01:38:58 Haha, I got you Ben.
01:39:00 Lol, what are friends for?
01:39:03 Lol magic.
01:39:04 It certainly is.
01:39:06 It's so cringe.
01:39:08 Haha, yes.
01:39:11 Okay, all right.
01:39:13 Getting off the highway.
01:39:15 Thank you, Irarre.
01:39:17 Thank you, Irarre.
01:39:19 Here's where I'm dropping you off, fam.
01:39:22 You're welcome, gib.
01:39:23 I'll send you the receipt, Ben.
01:39:25 Your pain.
01:39:27 Your pain where Ben St. lives.
01:39:30 Sure.
01:39:32 I forgot to draw the dialogue bubbles.
01:39:34 I started to have fun drawing the darkness wherein Ben St. lives.
01:39:38 In the darkest main.
01:39:41 So here's what it said in the last panel.
01:39:43 Ben, we're a few blocks down from where I live.
01:39:46 I'll guess we'll have to walk it.
01:39:48 Irarre, I would have driven us to your house had you not dissolved the carriage.
01:39:52 Yeah, probably.
01:39:58 Well, this is the saga continued.
01:40:02 The saga fucking continues.
01:40:04 People tuning.
01:40:05 Keep it up.
01:40:06 Viewership skyrocketing as people tune in to the cliffhangers of what's going to happen
01:40:10 in the next VinnyVinny VG comment.
01:40:13 Where's this going?
01:40:16 Truly a mystery.
01:40:20 Thank you again.
01:40:21 Thank you for another installment, Vinny.
01:40:24 I am on the edge of my seat.
01:40:28 Let's see.
01:40:29 Have we gotten any more?
01:40:30 Okay, the next one is the last one.
01:40:32 It's called a complaint from a very disgruntled fan at RFCK.
01:40:37 Three, two, one, go.
01:40:41 On episode 334 of the Procrastinator's podcast,
01:40:48 Given Take mentioned building a tower all the way up to the moon
01:40:53 and then jumping out of it and landing on the moon.
01:40:57 And I cannot believe.
01:41:00 I simply cannot believe that Ben Shane would not bring up the fact that this exact
01:41:06 concept has already been carried out in season three of RFCK Endless War.
01:41:13 When N1 of the slime corp industry went to the top of this big tower,
01:41:20 the slime corp HQ tower and jumped out and landed on the moon and got the red change.
01:41:28 Ben Shane, I will destroy you.
01:41:33 Fine.
01:41:36 Thanks.
01:41:37 Thanks for the voicemail.
01:41:40 Yeah, what was that?
01:41:42 That's right.
01:41:43 That did happen.
01:41:44 I'm sorry.
01:41:45 I was thinking about Mega Man.
01:41:47 I was thinking about Mega Man and how the orbital elevator through the Jacob project in X8.
01:41:53 That was just the first thing that came to mind.
01:41:56 I kind of miss knowing all of the lore of Endless Wars, like many cool things that happen.
01:42:03 I remember there was something going on at some point with like the ends of slime corp and 7 and 1, whatever.
01:42:12 I think that might be, yeah.
01:42:15 They were fighting something or maybe I imagined it, but there was some sort of event and it was cool,
01:42:20 but I didn't really pay attention to it.
01:42:22 Yeah, I think that was the season three finale.
01:42:27 I think that's what this disgruntled caller is talking about.
01:42:31 There was, gosh, yeah.
01:42:34 I'm probably not the best person to explain it, but I understand.
01:42:37 Yeah, N1 went to the moon and got the red chains.
01:42:42 And I think N1 turned out to be another death furnace himself.
01:42:50 Or maybe that was N0.
01:42:51 Ah, shit.
01:42:52 There was another death furnace that like sort of, I don't want to get it wrong.
01:43:01 I remember there were red chains and there was another death furnace and he was one of the ends.
01:43:05 It was either N1 or N0.
01:43:06 And I think, yeah, there was like an ARG thing where I think players had to like ascend the tower and like battle him.
01:43:14 I think that was it.
01:43:17 I hope I'm not making a fool of myself.
01:43:21 I mean, there's more to it, obviously, because I was not like following it super closely.
01:43:26 I just kind of heard about it after the fact.
01:43:28 The devs like did it all on their own.
01:43:30 Yeah, I remember like every so often there would be like a broadcast by one of the end operatives.
01:43:39 And I think it was a girl who has glasses, scientist girl.
01:43:44 Yeah.
01:43:45 And she said stuff and then there was like the little twink boy with the yellow hair or something.
01:43:53 Yes, the one with like the colorful outfit.
01:43:57 Yeah.
01:43:58 Yeah.
01:43:59 They would have like cryptic things talking about stuff and things.
01:44:02 And I think around the time I was considering like extending and finishing like Red Noir,
01:44:09 I was trying to think, how do I incorporate all of this stuff into Red Man's stupid mystery show?
01:44:15 But I couldn't figure it out because there's ARG stuff and I'm like, I'm really bad at ARGs.
01:44:20 I'm not patient at all.
01:44:23 At the moment, the shit, I hope I'm not behind, but I think the current meta is about like relics.
01:44:35 It's about like uncovering like ancient relics, like excavating them from the ground or something.
01:44:41 Actually, that was a while ago.
01:44:44 There might have been more developments on that front that I have not.
01:44:48 The last I remember hearing was we're uncovering ancient relics.
01:44:54 That's the thing.
01:44:56 Correct me if I'm wrong.
01:44:58 Disgruntled, disgruntled caller.
01:45:01 That was the last voicemail.
01:45:04 Oh, no.
01:45:05 Wait, no, that is.
01:45:07 I re-spreshed, but it did a thing.
01:45:12 I definitely had passion in those days when Endless War was just getting off the ground and we were getting it going.
01:45:27 I was waking up every day being like, yeah, time to work on the Endless War code.
01:45:34 Yeah, time to work on getting Season 2 launched.
01:45:40 Time to work on adding slime oids, lol.
01:45:43 Everyone's going to think this is so silly when this feature's done.
01:45:49 Those were the days.
01:45:53 Those were fun days.
01:45:55 Yeah, those were good times.
01:46:01 Well, anyway, that's the show.
01:46:07 I think days like that could come back.
01:46:10 You think so?
01:46:11 Yeah.
01:46:14 Yeah.
01:46:17 Maybe?
01:46:19 I don't know how.
01:46:21 I don't know how.
01:46:22 I don't know how to reach that.
01:46:25 You've got to do what Mufasa says.
01:46:27 You've got to do the remember who you are, Simba.
01:46:32 Look in the clouds.
01:46:34 Look in the reflection.
01:46:36 It's you.
01:46:37 It's Ben Saint.
01:46:39 Remember who you are.
01:46:42 Yeah.
01:46:44 And then also do something about it.
01:46:47 That's the part that Mufasa didn't mention.
01:46:50 I think I remember who I am.
01:46:54 I think so.
01:46:57 I don't know what to do about it.
01:46:59 I don't know how to deal with that problem.
01:47:02 Yeah.
01:47:04 It's not really my place to tell you exactly what to do.
01:47:07 I don't really know.
01:47:12 This is the...
01:47:16 The soon to be concluded Ben Depression arc is...
01:47:23 Next week it'll be over.
01:47:25 Oh, no, don't say next week because it will never be next week.
01:47:28 No, it'll be the end of the month.
01:47:30 End of the month it'll be over.
01:47:32 The dramatic conclusion.
01:47:35 Everything changes.
01:47:37 The total status quo.
01:47:39 Shake up.
01:47:41 It's coming and...
01:47:46 Unless something really terrible happens to screw up the schedule.
01:47:52 Like, yeah, no, it's basically done.
01:47:54 No, it's basically done.
01:47:58 I think I'll feel a weight off my shoulders when the video is out.
01:48:04 For sure, yeah.
01:48:06 We'll see how I feel after that.
01:48:15 Premiering...
01:48:18 If you check my channel for a trailer that will announce when it's coming out,
01:48:25 I'm expecting that I will probably release it on Saturday tomorrow,
01:48:28 the day after this video is live.
01:48:30 So if you're free tomorrow, maybe check out the premiere of my Mega Man video
01:48:36 that I keep saying is coming.
01:48:38 Well, one of these days it will and I think this is it.
01:48:40 I really think we're there.
01:48:41 I think we've arrived, so...
01:48:43 Oh, yeah.
01:48:44 Just fucking watch it.
01:48:46 Fucking watch it, leave a comment.
01:48:49 Puts my Patreon.

01:48:55 and also the procrastinators.
01:48:58 And of course, pledge the procrastinators Patreon.
01:49:00 We should do another bonus episode.
01:49:02 Yeah, what about...
01:49:03 Hey, you know what was fun?
01:49:04 Hey, I don't know.
01:49:05 You know what was fun?
01:49:06 Streaming this week.
01:49:07 Streaming was pretty good.
01:49:08 Yeah.
01:49:09 That was nice.
01:49:10 Had a good time.
01:49:11 We should...
01:49:13 Oh, we didn't even talk about that.
01:49:15 I guess there's not that much to say,
01:49:16 but yeah, we did stream for the first time in like two or three months, I think.
01:49:21 Yeah.
01:49:22 It had a little bit of an internet hiccup with like weird settings that...
01:49:27 But like it was quite stable other than that.
01:49:30 My...
01:49:31 You know, my internet.
01:49:33 Well, supposedly someone came and looked at my internet yesterday.
01:49:39 So, I mean, I guess we'll see going forward if my connection is better and more stable
01:49:45 and it's not as...
01:49:46 And it will stop fucking up.
01:49:49 I can't say with certainty right now, but maybe.
01:49:54 Anyway, we should stream more because it was fun.
01:49:58 Had a good time.
01:50:01 Make a main video.
01:50:04 Anything else?
01:50:05 I don't know.
01:50:06 A big girl squish.
01:50:08 Okay.
01:50:09 Twitter.com.
01:50:10 Yeah.
01:50:11 Based.
01:50:12 Based.
01:50:13 Based.
01:50:14 Based.
01:50:15 Okay, I guess that's the end of the episode.
01:50:18 Do we even make it two hours?
01:50:20 We're not even at two hours?
01:50:21 You know what?
01:50:22 It's the good old days.
01:50:23 It's the good old days of the PCP.
01:50:24 One hour episodes.
01:50:26 One hour 54 minutes is equatable to one hour.
01:50:30 It rounds down.
01:50:31 Yeah, it rounds down.
01:50:33 All right, that's it.
01:50:35 Short episode, but I hope you enjoyed it.
01:50:38 I won't belabor the point any longer.
01:50:42 See you next week.
01:50:43 See ya, everybody.
01:50:45 Peace out, goodbye.
01:50:47 Goodbye.
