00:00:00 I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Okay, hello, welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's Gibb's
00:00:18 not here today, I don't know what she's doing. Some nonsense I guess.
00:00:23 God rest.
00:00:24 Got ripped, but we've got Tectonic Improv, and Gamer's Tavern, aka Chrono, here in the
00:00:34 studio, here live in the studio, live studio audience.
00:00:38 Woo!
00:00:39 Woo!
00:00:40 Yeah, alright!
00:00:41 Woo!
00:00:42 I'm back!
00:00:43 Woo!
00:00:44 Yeah.
00:00:45 Yeah, it's been a while.
00:00:46 True.
00:00:47 I should start this off with one of my customary jokes.
00:00:51 God.
00:00:52 Yeah.
00:00:53 Of course.
00:00:54 Let's hear it.
00:00:55 Let's have it.
00:00:56 Ham sandwich walks into a bar and orders a beer, and the bartender says, sorry, we don't
00:01:02 serve food here.
00:01:03 Well, that?
00:01:04 Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:01:06 I'll play devil's advocate here, and say that that request is more than reasonable.
00:01:13 Ham sandwich, come on.
00:01:18 He can't even, he'll just get all soppy, like wet bread is gross.
00:01:22 That's just racism, because there's no law, like there's a law against serving minors.
00:01:28 He'd get in trouble.
00:01:29 There's no law against serving food, so that's just victory.
00:01:34 Yeah, but it's for some good.
00:01:36 It's foodism.
00:01:37 Oh, just like Jim Crow, right?
00:01:40 Yeah, exactly.
00:01:42 Ham sandwich loss.
00:01:44 Separate but equal, right?
00:01:46 Yeah, okay.
00:01:50 I'm going to spoil something that's going to happen later on in this podcast.
00:01:57 I think you might have heard that the Speakpipe mailbox finally filled up.
00:02:04 Congratulations everyone.
00:02:05 You broke it.
00:02:07 It was supposed to only hold like a hundred megabytes, because we have the test, what
00:02:15 do you call it?
00:02:16 The trial period.
00:02:17 Yeah, we have the trial period free membership.
00:02:20 It should have filled up like years ago, but it just kept letting us do more and more.
00:02:27 But at some point, a couple people messaged me and said, wait, and yet we got a new one
00:02:32 just yesterday.
00:02:34 How can this be?
00:02:36 I was going to say, I was hoping that meant that we would have less voicemails this time.
00:02:43 That's what, yeah, we would all hope.
00:02:46 Yeah, maybe, possibly.
00:02:49 But I'm looking and, yeah, actually we do.
00:02:52 Yeah, we have fewer than usual.
00:02:54 So I think, but here's the thing.
00:02:57 I will just go back and I will delete old ones from the, yeah.
00:03:03 So next week, by the time you're listening to this, it should be okay to send more.
00:03:07 But between then and now, the box will be full and I'm sorry about that.
00:03:13 The, yeah, trial period is 100 megabytes free.
00:03:17 Our current storage uses 1.86 gigabytes.
00:03:21 So we really, yeah, storage use 1.46 gigabytes out of 100 megabytes.
00:03:27 So we really got a ratio.
00:03:30 All I can say to that is ratio.
00:03:32 Do you like know for certain you have a trial account?
00:03:36 Maybe like Nate or someone just sprung for like a full account and you just never noticed.
00:03:42 I don't know how this works.
00:03:44 I don't, it's possible.
00:03:46 It says, it says this is the limit.
00:03:49 Wait here.
00:03:51 Fair enough then.
00:03:52 Yeah.
00:03:54 Here's our little, here's our little sidebar.
00:03:58 You can see for yourself.
00:04:00 I swear I'm not bullshitting you.
00:04:03 There's the blam screenshot down at the bottom, storage used.
00:04:08 I don't know.
00:04:10 Yeah, that's 1.46 gigabytes out of 100 megabytes.
00:04:14 Yeah, I wasn't lying.
00:04:16 Oh, that's up to me.
00:04:17 I don't know.
00:04:18 I don't see anything wrong here.
00:04:20 You know, for those who don't know, one gigabyte is 1000 megabytes.
00:04:25 True.
00:04:27 Because you know nowadays a lot of people don't know that.
00:04:30 You know, zoomers probably have no idea what megabyte even is.
00:04:35 Because the units just don't go that small?
00:04:39 Isn't it like a little different from like 1 to 1000?
00:04:43 Isn't it like a slight discrepancy?
00:04:46 Yeah, it's like maybe 1,024 or something like that.
00:04:50 I remember.
00:04:51 Wait, why?
00:04:52 I fucking computer code shit.
00:04:54 Who cares?
00:04:55 Okay.
00:04:56 I remember looking something up about it.
00:04:59 Because when I made my Super Mario Land video, for some reason I put a little diatribe in about the difference between a megabyte and a megabyte.
00:05:10 A megabyte.
00:05:11 A megabyte.
00:05:12 Yeah, like what's a megabyte?
00:05:14 Is that a pun?
00:05:15 No, it's just a different type of measurement.
00:05:20 I'm not going to speak on exactly what it is.
00:05:26 Is it something in like base 64 or some crap like that?
00:05:31 I think so.
00:05:33 Maybe.
00:05:34 I've never heard of it, but I have heard of megabits.
00:05:38 Yeah.
00:05:39 A megabyte equals two, oh it's two to the 20th bytes, or it's just over a million bytes.
00:05:46 So it's slightly more than a megabyte, but it's in base 64 or whatever.
00:05:53 I've got to wonder where it's used, or if it's like...
00:05:55 I think it's very base.
00:05:57 Very base.
00:05:58 Very base.
00:05:59 I think it would be used in a context in which you are using binary code, because it's base two.
00:06:06 I think that's probably why it exists.
00:06:09 But yeah, it just happens to be functionally almost the same size as a megabyte.
00:06:14 I'll be darned.
00:06:15 Yeah, that's funny.
00:06:17 I wonder if they sound similar on purpose.
00:06:20 Well now that we know that gender isn't binary, I think we need to retire binary code.
00:06:27 Yeah, I think it's got to go.
00:06:30 It's off the spectrum.
00:06:34 True.
00:06:35 Very problematic.
00:06:37 Ones and zeros.
00:06:39 We've got to do quantum computing.
00:06:44 It's kind of like how the hard drives, they used to be masters and slaves.
00:06:50 Yeah, oh yeah.
00:06:52 RIP.
00:06:54 You have male and female cords, or outlets, or whatever.
00:07:00 What did I see?
00:07:02 I saw a really funny meme that I thought was very clever, and here's what it is.
00:07:08 It was a Mr. Incredible face.
00:07:12 The happy one, and then the black and white scared looking one.
00:07:17 It was jobs in which...
00:07:24 When at your job, someone asks you to do...
00:07:28 Someone, jobs that require you to work with male on male or something like gay.
00:07:37 Work for gay, right?
00:07:39 And it's like, baker, good.
00:07:41 Yeah, make a cake for the gay people.
00:07:44 Something else, wedding planner, blah blah blah.
00:07:46 Last one was electrician.
00:07:48 No.
00:07:50 Oh yes, oh yes.
00:07:52 You see, the comedy came from when one frame of reference suddenly came into unexpected conflict with a second frame of reference that used the same vocabulary.
00:08:03 The joke was very human.
00:08:05 It caused a surprise reaction in me that gave me a sensation of delight and caused laughter.
00:08:12 Very human podcast.
00:08:15 It reminds me of that clip that you tweeted ages ago where Trixie was explaining some kind of joke.
00:08:23 Oh, I vaguely remember that.
00:08:28 I didn't remember what the joke was, but it was something like...
00:08:32 I don't know.
00:08:34 Do you remember what the joke was?
00:08:36 Oh yeah, I think it was something about majors and minors, and I think it was a quote on the album.
00:08:42 It was a rap verse, wasn't it?
00:08:44 Yeah.
00:08:45 Oh, she was explaining that somehow you see the...
00:08:48 Yes, yes, yes.
00:08:49 It was a Mr. Girl lyric about sex with minors, but he meant the joke was it was a play on minors as in children versus minors as in people that work in a mine,
00:09:02 which has never been done before.
00:09:04 Never heard that one before.
00:09:06 Yes, she was like, oh, here's why this is genius.
00:09:11 Here's the brilliance of this pun.
00:09:13 You see, it conflates the meaning of two different words that sound the same but are written differently.
00:09:17 Very human.
00:09:18 Well, you know what they say, you should never explain a joke.
00:09:23 Never under any circumstances, even if asked.
00:09:27 Yeah.
00:09:28 Yeah, exactly.
00:09:29 See, if you have to explain a joke...
00:09:32 Explaining a joke is like saying the n-word, you should never do it.
00:09:37 In...
00:09:39 What's the...
00:09:41 Ronald Reagan, in politics and comedy, if you're explaining, you're losing.
00:09:45 What's the actual quote?
00:09:46 What was the actual thing he said?
00:09:48 I think he said, oh, oof, ouch, oh, it hurts so bad.
00:09:52 Take me to a hospital immediately.
00:09:54 Oh, the hellfire is burning.
00:09:57 Margaret Thatcher, my friend, saved me.
00:10:03 Actually, speaking of Reagan,
00:10:06 did you guys see that the guy that tried to assassinate Reagan has a YouTube channel?
00:10:12 John Hinkley Jr., that's right.
00:10:14 Oh.
00:10:15 He's been making music recently.
00:10:20 He just recently, I think last June, got taken off his probation, so he was looking to tour.
00:10:27 Looking to tour?
00:10:29 To a couple of venues, but like every single venue keeps canceling on him.
00:10:33 Because he's John Hinkley Jr.
00:10:36 But that's fucked up.
00:10:38 Let the man play.
00:10:40 It's all I say.
00:10:41 He served, he served.
00:10:42 He did his time.
00:10:43 He's rehabilitated.
00:10:44 He did his time.
00:10:45 What is this?
00:10:46 Yeah, I think he did like 40 years or something.
00:10:48 Too much.
00:10:49 He only got out a couple of years ago, and only just recently his probation came out.
00:10:54 I think he's just recently able to post online.
00:10:58 I think he had someone else doing it for him until then.
00:11:01 When will, god damn it, when will they let, when will they let freakin, oh no.
00:11:11 I forgetting their names.
00:11:14 Molly and Orissa.
00:11:16 The Slenderman girl.
00:11:19 When will they let them post online?
00:11:21 I don't know.
00:11:23 They're not serving time, are they?
00:11:25 Because they're like writers.
00:11:26 One of them was let out fairly recently.
00:11:30 But I think she is still on probation and not allowed to use the internet.
00:11:33 Morgan, justice for Morgan and Anissa.
00:11:36 Oh yeah, because it wasn't one of them.
00:11:39 One of them was sort of the ringleader and the other was just kind of like a follower sort of thing.
00:11:46 So they were more lenient on the follower.
00:11:49 I know you talked about this last week.
00:11:52 I haven't listened to the episode.
00:11:54 I don't know what the official conclusion was.
00:11:58 From their testimony, they both kind of seemed to suggest the other one was in charge.
00:12:04 But I'm pretty sure that Morgan is the one that did the actual stabbing.
00:12:09 And Anissa is the other one.
00:12:14 And so I think it was probably safer for them to get her out of there.
00:12:19 Whenever you're in trouble, just blame the other guy.
00:12:22 Yeah.
00:12:24 Seems to be working out.
00:12:26 They're already on probation maybe.
00:12:27 It worked for Anissa. Anissa, I don't know.
00:12:32 The kid they stabbed didn't die, right?
00:12:35 She could have. She was pretty close to dying, but she did not die.
00:12:40 Yeah, they came pretty close to severing a fairly major artery, but they didn't.
00:12:46 Yeah, that story was fucking crazy.
00:12:49 Little known fact about me, I fucking loved Slenderman YouTube shows.
00:12:56 I watched all of them, even the really bad ones. I watched them.
00:13:01 Are you talking about like Marble Hornets?
00:13:03 Yeah, Marble Hornets, Evermint Hyrid, Tribe 12, Dark Harvest.
00:13:08 I watched some Marble Hornets because it was recommended to me.
00:13:12 I watched a bunch of it.
00:13:15 I wasn't around for when it was like popular.
00:13:18 Yeah.
00:13:20 I got the DVDs, baby.
00:13:25 They did. They had a Blu-ray too. Unfortunately, the Blu-ray is sold out.
00:13:30 I don't think they make it anymore, but yeah, I got the DVDs.
00:13:33 The menus are really good.
00:13:35 DVDs of Let's Plays.
00:13:37 It is kind of like that.
00:13:39 Oh my god.
00:13:41 It was kind of like Marble Hornets was like what, 2009, 2010?
00:13:46 And the DVDs I think were like early 2010.
00:13:50 So it was like one of the first ever YouTube things I ever got as physical media.
00:13:57 It's on my other shelf, so I'm not going to grab it and survey it right now.
00:14:03 It was pretty good.
00:14:05 The DVD menu was pretty well made.
00:14:09 They had a commentary for all the episodes.
00:14:13 Aren't there like a million episodes?
00:14:16 I think there's like 60 something.
00:14:19 They span it over three seasons, quote-unquote.
00:14:24 So they did like creator commentary tracks.
00:14:26 They did, yeah, for every episode.
00:14:28 That's amazing.
00:14:29 Yeah, that's cool.
00:14:30 That actually sounds great.
00:14:31 And that should be done with a PCP as well.
00:14:34 Did you guys do that a couple of times?
00:14:37 That's a great idea. We did it once.
00:14:41 I think we just did it once, but yeah, the creator commentary track.
00:14:47 Actually, I think you did it a few times.
00:14:49 Patreon.com. That's procrastinators.
00:14:51 If you want to hear the director's commentary of...
00:14:55 I don't even remember which episode we did it of.
00:14:57 I think it was an early one.
00:14:58 Probably the first one, right?
00:15:00 Yeah, it might have been the first one.
00:15:03 It was an early one.
00:15:04 I think you did it a few times and I was on for one of those.
00:15:07 One of the episodes was the first episode I was on.
00:15:12 No, what? You're right.
00:15:13 I think we actually did it.
00:15:14 I think we did it twice.
00:15:16 That sounds right.
00:15:18 Yeah, maybe one of them was the first one.
00:15:22 Anyway, it worked great.
00:15:23 It made perfect sense in an audio medium and nobody complained.
00:15:28 Yeah, that's how I remember it.
00:15:32 Yeah, yeah.
00:15:34 Anyway.
00:15:35 It doesn't seem like that terrible of an idea.
00:15:39 It's a bit...
00:15:42 I think some people said it's a little confusing because you keep hearing the same voices.
00:15:48 Oh, sure.
00:15:49 One is past Ben and one is future Ben.
00:15:52 The one is commentating on the other and it can be a little hard to keep track.
00:15:56 I think...
00:15:57 Well, whichever one doesn't sound like he's talking through a tin can is the normal Ben.
00:16:02 That's true.
00:16:03 Also, my voice just changed over the years.
00:16:06 My voice became higher pitch for some reason.
00:16:11 Did you originally record lying on your stomach or something?
00:16:17 Do you know what?
00:16:18 Actually, I think I did.
00:16:20 Not all the time, but I think I probably would record lying on my stomach.
00:16:24 Yeah, there was a time when I did that.
00:16:27 That might have something to do with it then.
00:16:29 It's a very Ben core thing to do.
00:16:31 Yeah, now that you mention it.
00:16:34 There's that Let's Player streamer Northern Lion.
00:16:39 I watched him for a really long time.
00:16:41 In the early days, his voice is a lot deeper and a lot less animated, I guess.
00:16:48 Nowadays, he sounds different.
00:16:50 You could chalk that up to just like,
00:16:52 Oh, well, he's been doing this for a long time.
00:16:54 He's more comfortable.
00:16:55 It's also because I remember hearing that he used to record lying on his back with his laptop on his stomach,
00:17:02 playing the games.
00:17:04 That's going to change how your voice sounds.
00:17:07 Even if I stood up instead of sat down when podcasting, it sounded a little different.
00:17:12 That's a strategy.
00:17:14 There definitely were episodes where I wouldn't lie on my back with my laptop on my stomach.
00:17:20 I would lie on my stomach with my head in hand hanging over the front edge of the bed
00:17:26 with the laptop on my floor in front of me.
00:17:28 Oh, wow.
00:17:30 Voice actors need to take notes because this is how you really do it.
00:17:34 This is how you get range.
00:17:36 That's the professional podcasters tip right there.
00:17:41 That one's for free.
00:17:43 How do you think Mel Blanc did it?
00:17:45 All those amazing voices.
00:17:48 Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Marvin the Martian.
00:17:51 He was lying on his stomach for a lot of them.
00:17:53 Yeah, he's lying on his stomach on his back doing pull-ups.
00:17:56 Lying in different positions.
00:17:58 They never got back to me about my voice acting audition for that stupid deaf Pina cartoon.
00:18:07 Oh, I'll never make it.
00:18:10 Is there something happening with that?
00:18:14 I haven't been listening to the PCP for a while.
00:18:18 I fell off the wagon.
00:18:20 I'm recently catching up.
00:18:22 Weeks and weeks ago, he just put out a casting call for voice actors for some cartoon he was making.
00:18:30 I said, sure, why not?
00:18:32 I just recorded some lines and sent them.
00:18:35 I didn't hear anything back.
00:18:38 That's fucked up.
00:18:40 Do you have any nepotism you could use?
00:18:42 Do you have a cheesy note or something?
00:18:44 I don't know.
00:18:49 I guess I was like, if on some chance he knew who Ben St. was,
00:18:54 if he'd seen the Sonichu lecture or something,
00:18:57 maybe that could have helped me name recognition-wise,
00:19:00 but to my knowledge, nothing came of that.
00:19:05 And it's probably been too late at this.
00:19:08 Either the project's canceled or he picked someone else.
00:19:11 Surely, surely.
00:19:13 Which is not okay.
00:19:16 So I'm not cool with it.
00:19:19 I'm going to be very mad.
00:19:21 I'm going to dislike bomb the video.
00:19:24 I'm going to lead a social media campaign against it.
00:19:26 I'm going to make it personal.
00:19:28 I'm going to make it his problem.
00:19:30 And then he's going to rue the day.
00:19:33 Yeah, I mean...
00:19:35 That guy has some controversies under his belt, right?
00:19:39 Yeah, probably.
00:19:41 I don't think I've ever seen a Daphne video.
00:19:43 He's fine.
00:19:45 I guess he calls people out.
00:19:48 Oh, that sounds great.
00:19:50 Yeah, his shtick is that he's monotone.
00:19:53 Oh, that's a great shtick.
00:19:55 Yeah, it's a good one.
00:19:56 Yeah, I know that shtick very well.
00:20:04 Speaking of voice acting, I wanted to briefly mention
00:20:07 that infamous scene in Mega Man X4.
00:20:11 I think you talked about it before.
00:20:13 I mean, this can't be happening.
00:20:15 Oh, there's no more point going on in this world.
00:20:19 What am I fighting for?
00:20:22 I skipped a line, didn't I?
00:20:24 No, Iris, no.
00:20:26 Don't hate humans, Zero.
00:20:28 You can't hate humans.
00:20:30 I agree with the colonel.
00:20:34 We must fight for our independence,
00:20:37 for we are the replifors.
00:20:40 I'm a fucking good game.
00:20:43 Well, I just wanted to mention that
00:20:46 I was curious about listening to the original Japanese version
00:20:50 because I heard it was better.
00:20:52 How could it not be?
00:20:54 I looked it up and it does sound way better.
00:20:58 Here's the link to the clip if you want to listen to it.
00:21:02 It's kind of a shame that the US version
00:21:08 got really bad dubbing
00:21:11 because I think the story to this game
00:21:14 would have been pretty good if the dub didn't suck so bad.
00:21:17 I agree.
00:21:19 It completely turns Iris' death into a huge meme.
00:21:24 That said, Iris was introduced in this game
00:21:29 and I feel like I wouldn't really care about her regardless.
00:21:33 The way they handled it,
00:21:35 I don't think there was anything they could have done
00:21:38 with the presentation to salvage the character of Iris.
00:21:41 The performance here is actually kind of impressive
00:21:45 because I don't know the Japanese voice actor's name,
00:21:49 but his screams were like gut-wrenching.
00:21:53 I was surprised by how good this performance was.
00:21:57 I'm almost there.
00:21:59 Yeah, that's a good anime scream.
00:22:02 I love a good anime scream.
00:22:04 Yeah, that's good.
00:22:06 It's totally good.
00:22:08 Have either of you played Mega Man X or Maverick Hunter X for the PSP?
00:22:16 Is that the remake?
00:22:18 No, I have not.
00:22:20 The voice act?
00:22:22 Well, I don't blame you because it was only on PSP
00:22:26 and I don't think they put it on any PSN store.
00:22:29 I just philosophically disagree with the idea of going back
00:22:35 and remaking the game because it wasn't good enough?
00:22:39 I agree with that.
00:22:41 I feel like it's not...
00:22:44 I would never really say it's definitively better than Mega Man X.
00:22:50 It seems more like they're trying to reboot things
00:22:53 because you've probably seen...
00:22:56 I remember you talking about the Day of Sigma OVA or whatever.
00:23:00 There's slight story discrepancies between the games,
00:23:03 but I like the voice acting in that game a lot.
00:23:06 The English dub.
00:23:08 In Maverick Hunter.
00:23:10 The thing is though is that that came out so much later
00:23:15 that dubbing standards in anime just was way better by then.
00:23:19 You have to remember that Mega Man X4 came out in 97
00:23:23 and most anime back then were dubbed horribly.
00:23:28 If you watch a lot of anime from the time, this dubbing sounds pretty familiar.
00:23:32 Yeah.
00:23:34 I think some anime had gotten a cut above this at this point,
00:23:41 but when video games...
00:23:44 I took to Final Fantasy X for voice acting and video games to be not fucking terrible.
00:23:50 I learned from Mage that we didn't really get this in America,
00:23:54 but in some countries, dubbing simply...
00:23:57 They didn't even take out the original audio.
00:24:00 They just...
00:24:02 One person just narrated the subtitles.
00:24:06 Yeah, Mage said that when she watched Dragon Ball Z,
00:24:10 it was just have someone's voice recorded over the unedited original Japanese audio,
00:24:16 just sort of repeating the lines but in Lithuanian or the native place,
00:24:22 the native language, the vernacular.
00:24:24 That sounds interesting.
00:24:25 I want to check out Lithuanian Dragon Ball Z.
00:24:29 Yeah, I mean, it'd probably be easier if it were a language you understood,
00:24:34 but yeah, just imagine like...
00:24:38 Japanese is still there.
00:24:39 Just someone is just one guy.
00:24:42 It's saying the lines.
00:24:43 It's like the PCP commentary tracks.
00:24:46 Yeah, it's like...
00:24:48 I should do a solo Ben.
00:24:52 I should do a solo Ben?
00:24:54 Wait, you know what?
00:24:55 I'm going to do that.
00:24:56 I'm going to do a solo Ben cast commentary track on one of the solo Ben cast.
00:25:01 I'm doing it.
00:25:02 No, I'm doing it.
00:25:03 I'm writing it down.
00:25:04 That's a great idea.
00:25:05 I'm 100%.
00:25:06 Yes, thank you.
00:25:07 Excellent.
00:25:11 Okay.
00:25:12 I'm trying to think of some early video game dubs that I think are pretty good.
00:25:18 Like Metal Gear, Solid is good.
00:25:22 Yeah, it's probably one of the best ones.
00:25:27 You know, I'm playing the old Resident Evil games,
00:25:30 and I actually kind of like the Resident Evil 2 dub,
00:25:32 even though it's corny and cheesy.
00:25:36 Yeah.
00:25:37 Other RE games, although RE1 is kind of...
00:25:40 I have never played Resident Evil, any of them.
00:25:44 But I have, you know, there's sort of a...
00:25:47 I've heard people say, I mean, sort of the goofy, like, wrong...
00:25:53 No, it's Silent Hill.
00:25:55 Silent Hill is the one that I hear people say that, like,
00:25:57 James is, like, stilted and kind of objectively bad delivery
00:26:01 actually sort of increases the uncanniness.
00:26:04 Yeah, I've heard people talk about that as well,
00:26:06 that, like, because Guy Sihi, I think, is his name.
00:26:09 He wasn't, like...
00:26:11 He wasn't a voice actor or, like, a professionally trained one.
00:26:15 There's, like, this funny story where he was taking his daughter to a rehearsal
00:26:20 or an audition to play the little girl in the game, Laura, I think, is her name.
00:26:25 And she didn't get the part, but they asked him to try for James,
00:26:29 and he got the part.
00:26:31 And I've never played Silent Hill,
00:26:35 but I did watch a Let's Play of it years ago,
00:26:38 so I basically know, like, the story, and I can comment on the performances.
00:26:41 And I think the voice acting in the game is actually really good,
00:26:44 because, like...
00:26:46 That's Silent Hill 2 or the first one?
00:26:48 2.
00:26:49 2, yeah, I should have clarified.
00:26:51 Because, yeah, it does sort of sound, like, sort of stilted and odd,
00:26:57 but in sort of a more, like, a homely way than, like, an incompetent sort of way.
00:27:06 I don't know.
00:27:09 Because, like...
00:27:10 Can I have something about it?
00:27:12 Silent Hill, either, so...
00:27:16 But I've seen that...
00:27:19 I've seen that... is it that Twin Perfect series?
00:27:24 About the...
00:27:26 The games.
00:27:28 What is that series called?
00:27:30 That second thing, Silent Hill or something?
00:27:33 I don't think that's it.
00:27:35 Two Peaks?
00:27:37 That's where the name comes from.
00:27:39 Yeah.
00:27:40 I've actually never seen those Twin Perfect videos,
00:27:43 but I have watched another video a couple years ago,
00:27:48 basically talking about how that Twin Perfect series
00:27:54 is inadvertently responsible for putting a lot of the blame
00:27:59 onto this one Silent Hill producer named...
00:28:03 Yes.
00:28:04 What's his name?
00:28:05 Tom Hewlett.
00:28:06 Tom Hewlett.
00:28:07 Yeah, they go pretty hard on Tom Hewlett in that...
00:28:10 I might...
00:28:11 Yeah, okay, it's called The Real Silent Hill Experience.
00:28:14 Nate recommended it to me years and years ago.
00:28:18 I have kind of come to...
00:28:21 I kind of think the guy's evil.
00:28:24 I kind of think the guy is evil a little bit,
00:28:27 the Twin Perfect guy.
00:28:29 He seems like a douchebag.
00:28:31 That's perfect, isn't it?
00:28:33 Aren't there two people?
00:28:36 There is, but the other one quit,
00:28:39 and I think has apologized for a lot of...
00:28:42 I think specifically for the harassment that Tom Hewlett received.
00:28:46 But the other guy has not.
00:28:50 That's a shame because...
00:28:53 I've never even seen those videos,
00:28:55 and I remember back in the day that a lot...
00:28:59 I remember people blaming this one producer dude, Tom Hewlett,
00:29:04 and I watched this video a couple years ago.
00:29:07 It's a two-part, but whatever.
00:29:10 I think you or someone else might have shown me this one.
00:29:13 Yeah, because I didn't know anything about it.
00:29:16 I saw the Twin Perfect one, and the Twin Perfect puts...
00:29:19 They say they're not doing this, but...
00:29:22 And then they name-drop on it.
00:29:24 You come away with the impression that basically this is Tom Hewlett's fault.
00:29:28 I assume that that is not entirely their invention.
00:29:32 I assume that probably a lot of the community put the blame on him, too,
00:29:36 and they sort of echoed that sentiment.
00:29:39 But then it just reinforced it.
00:29:42 My outside perspective is,
00:29:44 oh yeah, Tom Hewlett, that guy who ruined Silent Hill.
00:29:47 And I don't even know anything about any of this.
00:29:50 It seems so weird in hindsight
00:29:54 to foot the blame at some dude who may have had
00:29:58 some small amount of creative control regarding the series.
00:30:03 When it's fairly obvious that,
00:30:07 since it's a Konami game,
00:30:09 who the fuck else ruined Silent Hill but fucking Konami?
00:30:12 They ruined everything.
00:30:14 I was under the impression that every Silent Hill game
00:30:17 was handled by a different team.
00:30:21 The first three or four were done by an internal team
00:30:27 that disbanded shortly after, I think.
00:30:30 And then the rest of them, yeah,
00:30:32 they got done by different teams at Konami
00:30:35 or outsourced from Konami.
00:30:37 Way forward actually did a couple of Silent Hills, I think,
00:30:40 which Tom Hewlett works at way forward now, by the way.
00:30:44 What else did way forward do?
00:30:47 They make a Chante series, I think, right?
00:30:50 Oh yeah, yeah, okay.
00:30:52 They're fairly well known for making licensed games
00:30:57 that are better than you would expect.
00:31:01 And then every once in a while they do an original game
00:31:03 that's like an indie darling.
00:31:05 They were supposed to make that Advance Wars remake
00:31:07 that Nintendo delayed because of the Ukraine crisis
00:31:12 and is still not come out.
00:31:14 Advance Wars?
00:31:16 Yeah, they were remaking Advance Wars 1 and 2 for Switch.
00:31:20 Are they like in Ukraine or something?
00:31:22 Is that why the...
00:31:24 The...
00:31:26 I've never played Advance Wars, but from what I understand...
00:31:29 I did play it back on the Game Boy Advance
00:31:31 and I could ever beat the Final Stage.
00:31:33 The Black Hole Army, Sturm is too fucking hard
00:31:36 on the Final Stage for Kid Me.
00:31:39 I think they delayed it partly because, I mean,
00:31:43 there was a big war in the news
00:31:46 and the game's called Advance Wars.
00:31:48 Oh, because it's about war and war is bad.
00:31:50 War's bad, everyone's like, wait a minute.
00:31:52 We don't want to advance war, we want to reduce war.
00:31:55 It's stupid.
00:31:57 But also, the villain,
00:32:00 the main villain faction of the game is a Russian analog.
00:32:03 So I guess they wanted to avoid all controversy altogether.
00:32:07 But it's silly.
00:32:09 The game is apparently completely done
00:32:11 and has been done for months.
00:32:13 They should just release it.
00:32:16 That's the thing, if you're going to wait for a moment
00:32:19 and there's no war to release this game,
00:32:21 then you're going to be waiting a long time.
00:32:23 Honestly, I feel like...
00:32:26 Yeah, some people might get mad,
00:32:28 but I kind of just feel like nerds who are into war stuff
00:32:31 would just be more excited
00:32:33 if it reminds them of a current ongoing conflict.
00:32:36 I feel like that might move units, I don't know.
00:32:39 Ha, move units. No pun intended.
00:32:42 Yeah.
00:32:44 I think it's, since Advance Wars is made by a Japanese company,
00:32:47 they have maybe weirder views on this
00:32:50 compared to other developers.
00:32:52 Possibly.
00:32:54 I don't know.
00:32:57 I can see why they would want to do it,
00:33:00 but it's not like this crisis is going to end.
00:33:04 I mean, it's not over still.
00:33:06 What are you going to do? Never release the game?
00:33:08 Because a war happens?
00:33:10 A silly little war? Come on, we want video games.
00:33:13 Exactly, exactly.
00:33:15 Let's not lose perspective of what's really important here.
00:33:18 Video games.
00:33:20 I think also it has to do with Nintendo specifically.
00:33:24 They're very adverse to anything that is controversial.
00:33:28 They want to be family friendly.
00:33:30 Yeah, I mean, I guess that is true.
00:33:32 You want to know what a real...
00:33:34 It's actually kind of weird that they even have a war-based game at all.
00:33:38 Do you know...
00:33:39 Well, it's kind of cartoony.
00:33:41 I feel like that's how they get away with it.
00:33:45 Until that one on DS when it's not.
00:33:47 It is very cartoony, but at the same time,
00:33:50 it is about just regular people fucking killing each other
00:33:54 in a fucking field of battle on operations.
00:33:58 But at the same time, Andy doesn't know what an airport is.
00:34:04 I vaguely remember that.
00:34:07 There's something really funny.
00:34:10 A really dark coincidence with Advance Wars
00:34:14 and the original Game Boy Advance game.
00:34:17 It came out, I believe, September 10th, 2001.
00:34:24 So...
00:34:25 No!
00:34:26 I'm pretty...
00:34:27 No!
00:34:28 Sturm used Meteor!
00:34:31 I'm looking this up to get specific.
00:34:33 I know it came out right around 9-11.
00:34:37 Are you saying that Intelligent Systems did 9-11?
00:34:42 I'm not saying they didn't.
00:34:44 No.
00:34:45 We couldn't prove that.
00:34:50 Ah, jeez.
00:34:51 September 10th.
00:34:52 Yep.
00:34:53 September 10th.
00:34:54 September 10th.
00:34:55 That's crazy.
00:34:56 If only...
00:34:57 You know what?
00:34:58 If only they had just done for the war in Afghanistan
00:35:03 what they are now doing for the war in Ukraine
00:35:06 and delayed the game,
00:35:07 and we wouldn't have done 9-11.
00:35:09 So maybe they're right after all.
00:35:12 In honor of Operation Iraqi Freedom
00:35:14 we are delaying Advance Wars.
00:35:17 It will release when all the troops are gone
00:35:21 from the Middle East.
00:35:23 Nintendo should have used their power.
00:35:26 We could have ended the war so much sooner.
00:35:28 Because Osama bin Laden's like,
00:35:30 Well, fuck!
00:35:31 I wanted to play that!
00:35:33 George W.
00:35:35 It's just like, ah, come on.
00:35:38 I love Andy.
00:35:42 That's exactly what would have happened.
00:35:44 Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein's in his little hidey hole
00:35:47 playing elite copy
00:35:49 with his little head sticking out or whatever.
00:35:55 Just think of what...
00:35:56 All of this could have been avoided.
00:35:58 If Nintendo was just a little less callous
00:36:01 with their video game releases,
00:36:03 I think this is the learning lesson.
00:36:05 Nintendo needs to use their platform for good.
00:36:08 They need to be better.
00:36:09 Instead of cancelling,
00:36:11 instead of copyright striking YouTubers
00:36:14 for using video game footage,
00:36:16 they should be copyright striking
00:36:18 the United States government
00:36:20 for conducting various CIA-backed coups
00:36:25 around the world.
00:36:27 They need to DMCA the United States government
00:36:30 for committing wars.
00:36:32 I believe that is our intellectual property
00:36:34 that you're infringing upon.
00:36:36 You're emulating wars?
00:36:38 I don't know.
00:36:40 They didn't buy the hard copy.
00:36:43 They copyrighted anything that has to do
00:36:46 with advanced warfare.
00:36:49 Speaking of the Game Boy Advance
00:36:53 and speaking of Mega Man,
00:36:55 I played some zero games recently.
00:36:59 My feeling from my adolescence
00:37:03 was that they were the best,
00:37:05 and I'm happy to say I was right.
00:37:07 They are still the best Mega Man games ever made.
00:37:11 The Zero Series is a big blind spot for me.
00:37:15 I know Chrono likes them,
00:37:17 and I know you like them,
00:37:19 but my experience with Mega Man Zero
00:37:21 was walking into a GameStop
00:37:23 when I was seven,
00:37:25 and then in the GBA kiosk...
00:37:27 It would be very challenging for a seven-year-old.
00:37:29 Yeah.
00:37:31 As you'll see shortly,
00:37:33 I think it was 0-3
00:37:36 was in a kiosk thing.
00:37:38 It's just a good-ass video game.
00:37:41 I was playing it.
00:37:43 I think I got to a boss and then died.
00:37:45 I was like, well, fuck me. This is way too hard.
00:37:47 Had you had any experience with Mega Man before that?
00:37:51 Yeah, I played X back in the day,
00:37:53 and Legends.
00:37:55 I feel like if you can beat the X bosses,
00:37:57 you can beat the Zero boss.
00:37:59 I never said anything about beating it.
00:38:01 I just played it.
00:38:03 I could probably beat it nowadays.
00:38:05 I know there's a collection that you can get.
00:38:07 Yeah, the Zero and X.
00:38:09 I'd be curious to try it.
00:38:11 I've never played ZX.
00:38:13 It's so good.
00:38:15 I know that...
00:38:17 Are you playing it through an emulator
00:38:19 or just that collection thing?
00:38:21 No, I'm playing on the Visual Boy Advance emulator.
00:38:23 Word up.
00:38:25 I actually prefer Gameplay-wise.
00:38:27 I prefer the X 1 through 4
00:38:29 to the Zero series.
00:38:31 But I think as far as the story is concerned,
00:38:33 the Zero series is definitely...
00:38:35 It's more cohesive.
00:38:37 Yeah.
00:38:39 What really stands out
00:38:41 is just the fact that
00:38:43 in the Zero games,
00:38:45 when you're not on a mission,
00:38:47 you're in the base
00:38:49 and you can just walk around
00:38:51 and talk to the other people
00:38:53 who live in the base and the other people
00:38:55 who are being affected by the war
00:38:57 that you're fighting.
00:38:59 It's such an obvious thing
00:39:01 to include.
00:39:03 It just makes the game a million times better.
00:39:05 Yeah.
00:39:07 And in the first one,
00:39:09 you can actually go to the missions
00:39:11 from the base directly without warping there.
00:39:13 They kind of pulled Dark Souls
00:39:15 where they made the first one
00:39:17 and they gave it this really cool
00:39:19 connected, continuous world
00:39:21 that was really cool.
00:39:23 And they were like,
00:39:25 that was hard.
00:39:27 Kind of is hard, I guess.
00:39:29 I guess it's hard.
00:39:31 But it was appreciated.
00:39:33 And they didn't do it again.
00:39:35 Which is fine.
00:39:37 I guess.
00:39:39 From a story standpoint,
00:39:41 the events of one game
00:39:43 lead into the other one.
00:39:45 And it feels like the world
00:39:47 and the characters are changing
00:39:49 from a game to game basis
00:39:51 that carries over.
00:39:53 The problem
00:39:55 with the X series story-wise
00:39:57 is that every time you beat one game
00:39:59 the next game starts and it just feels
00:40:01 like everything resets back to
00:40:03 the default values.
00:40:05 Pretty much.
00:40:07 Well, we beat Sigma,
00:40:09 but he's a freaking ghost in the machine now
00:40:11 and you can't actually beat him.
00:40:13 So I guess he'll be back.
00:40:15 I know that Dr. Wiley
00:40:17 always came back in the Mega Man series
00:40:19 but it always rubbed me the wrong way
00:40:21 that Sigma would come back in every game.
00:40:23 For some reason, there was a disconnect there
00:40:25 that it always seemed kind of cheap.
00:40:27 Like the second time in the second game
00:40:29 when he comes back, okay, that's fine.
00:40:31 Because he turns into a data thing.
00:40:33 That's interesting.
00:40:35 There comes a point where
00:40:37 they should have stopped.
00:40:39 Yeah, bring him back
00:40:41 every couple of games, I guess.
00:40:43 I haven't played it,
00:40:45 but I think in X7
00:40:47 or X8, he comes back
00:40:49 and he's all
00:40:51 fucked up looking and mutated because
00:40:53 he's like, yeah, he just keeps coming back.
00:40:55 I think that was X6.
00:40:57 He comes back as a zombie.
00:40:59 But he's not the same.
00:41:01 It's like they knew. We really shouldn't keep
00:41:03 dragging this guy back, but we have to do it.
00:41:05 Actually,
00:41:07 X6, technically, Sigma wasn't
00:41:09 the actual final boss
00:41:11 even though you fight him as the final boss.
00:41:13 Yeah, he was that gay guy.
00:41:15 He was a scientist.
00:41:17 He was some red-white scientist.
00:41:19 Yeah.
00:41:21 He was the main one putting the strings
00:41:23 and he revived Sigma for some reason.
00:41:25 Well, because you need to fight Sigma at the end.
00:41:27 Yeah, literally.
00:41:29 Sigma has nothing to do with that one,
00:41:31 but then at the end he's like, okay,
00:41:33 hey, you beat me.
00:41:35 My machinations have been unraveled.
00:41:37 Final note, I did revive Sigma just in case.
00:41:39 So go fight him as well.
00:41:41 Okay, thank you.
00:41:43 Crazy about that is the
00:41:45 final battle with Sigma in that game
00:41:47 is probably the most unnecessary in the series
00:41:49 so far. The music is probably
00:41:51 the best Sigma battle out of any
00:41:53 of the Sigma songs. It's like a remix
00:41:55 of the first three. It's really good.
00:41:57 I don't remember the music.
00:42:01 Actually,
00:42:03 I don't know if it's a spoiler to reveal it,
00:42:05 but at the very end of X8
00:42:07 you don't fight Sigma, surprisingly.
00:42:09 It's Luminae, right?
00:42:11 I never played X8.
00:42:13 I have not...
00:42:15 I haven't played that one either.
00:42:17 I know who Luminae is.
00:42:19 I always heard that it was better
00:42:21 than 7, but like
00:42:23 better than 7 is not
00:42:25 really a high bar.
00:42:27 Yeah.
00:42:29 But I think it's better than X5
00:42:31 and 6 as well.
00:42:33 Oh, yeah. X6 is kind of...
00:42:35 X6 is bad.
00:42:37 I would say 5. I don't really like 5.
00:42:39 I think 5 is where
00:42:41 it kind of went off the deep end for me.
00:42:43 Yeah, I consider 5 bad, to be honest.
00:42:45 It has an interesting story, but everything else
00:42:47 about it sucks.
00:42:49 5 is pretty whack.
00:42:51 He's the bad guy in 5.
00:42:53 You know, the whole cannon thing where you have
00:42:55 a random chance of getting a different ending.
00:42:57 Oh, yeah.
00:42:59 You can fire the cannon whenever you want,
00:43:01 but if you beat all the stages
00:43:03 you have a better chance
00:43:05 of the cannon being successful.
00:43:07 Even if you beat all the stages,
00:43:09 you can still lose, lol.
00:43:11 And you can still get the bad ending.
00:43:13 Why not?
00:43:15 It's right there.
00:43:17 It's right there.
00:43:19 If you beat all the stages,
00:43:21 you get the good ending.
00:43:23 I don't know. Come on.
00:43:25 Why would you make it random?
00:43:27 It's bizarre.
00:43:29 Yeah, the Zero Games.
00:43:33 I don't think this is the case,
00:43:35 but the story is tight enough that you would
00:43:37 think that they went into it planning to make
00:43:39 4, and they were like, here's the plan.
00:43:41 1, 2, 3, 4, done.
00:43:43 Apparently that's not the case.
00:43:45 Because I guess I read in an interview
00:43:47 or something that, like,
00:43:49 after X3, they were planning on making X3
00:43:51 the end.
00:43:53 But then, like...
00:43:55 But fans wanted to know what happened
00:43:57 with Dr. Vile.
00:43:59 So we had to make 4.
00:44:01 Dr. Vile?
00:44:03 Dr. Vile.
00:44:05 And it's like...
00:44:07 Oh, zero, zero.
00:44:09 I thought you were talking about X.
00:44:11 I was like, who the fuck is this?
00:44:13 In Zero 3,
00:44:15 they ended it,
00:44:17 and it literally ends with
00:44:19 Dr. Vile is back,
00:44:21 and he's in charge now.
00:44:23 And that's the ending.
00:44:25 And we were surprised.
00:44:27 Fans were unsatisfied.
00:44:29 Fans wanted to know what happened
00:44:31 and it's like, yeah.
00:44:33 What did you think was going to happen?
00:44:35 Ah, jeez.
00:44:37 And then they fucking made it,
00:44:39 and 4 has the best fucking ending.
00:44:41 4 has the best ending, the most definitive ending.
00:44:43 They brought it to a conclusive,
00:44:45 satisfying resolution.
00:44:47 Yeah, I watched Gamer and Savarin's video
00:44:49 on that ending. It seemed pretty cool.
00:44:51 Right, right.
00:44:53 I remember first experiencing
00:44:55 that ending back when the game came out,
00:44:57 and I beat it.
00:44:59 And then back then, I was like,
00:45:01 this is a really great ending.
00:45:03 So then, like 10 plus years later,
00:45:05 I was still thinking about that ending,
00:45:07 so that's why I wanted to make a video on it.
00:45:09 Yeah.
00:45:11 Literally,
00:45:13 the best ending that any Mega Man game has
00:45:15 because it actually has one.
00:45:17 Yeah, they actually had the courage
00:45:19 to end things
00:45:21 for certain,
00:45:23 not leave it up in the air with all the other ones
00:45:25 that they usually do.
00:45:27 How tied in is the ZX series?
00:45:29 I know it takes place like...
00:45:31 Isn't the plot of ZX is like, it's like
00:45:33 years and years later,
00:45:35 and like kids,
00:45:37 they get data of
00:45:39 0 and X, and like, where them is like,
00:45:41 armor, basically.
00:45:43 Yeah, they do a funny...
00:45:45 Kids in the future do a funny fusion dance
00:45:47 to
00:45:49 call upon the power of the ancient
00:45:51 Reployed Heroes
00:45:53 and become superheroes.
00:45:55 Well, when you say it like that,
00:45:57 it sounds kind of stupid.
00:45:59 Oh, sorry.
00:46:01 I haven't played it myself,
00:46:03 but yeah, the plot seems very
00:46:05 very Saturday morning cartoon.
00:46:07 Like, they wanted to make a Mega Man game,
00:46:09 but they were kind of embarrassed about
00:46:11 what they were doing, so they tried to
00:46:13 make it distant.
00:46:15 It's...
00:46:17 But also, pretty much the whole ZX
00:46:19 story sounds like
00:46:21 just a big pastiche
00:46:23 of homage. They're just like,
00:46:25 let's make it a...
00:46:27 Yeah, the stories in those games are kind of
00:46:29 underwhelming, but I like
00:46:31 the concept of
00:46:33 humans that can transform into
00:46:35 the X
00:46:37 and zero heroes and stuff.
00:46:39 I've always been a sucker for
00:46:41 the Super Sentai or Power Rangers
00:46:43 concept of superheroes.
00:46:45 I think it's a very
00:46:47 silly place to take the series,
00:46:49 but I'm not like...
00:46:51 completely against it.
00:46:53 I'm just kind of...
00:46:55 I just kind of find it
00:46:57 amusing, like, hmm, okay.
00:46:59 Really? That's what you're going to do
00:47:01 with it? I mean, alright.
00:47:03 Sure. Well, it's never going to be as cool
00:47:05 as what the Mega Man Zero series did.
00:47:07 It's hard to imagine.
00:47:09 I think...
00:47:11 I really just miss Mega Man.
00:47:13 Having played through
00:47:15 Legends and Legends 2 recently,
00:47:17 yeah, Zero used to be
00:47:19 a far and away favorite. I thought it was obviously
00:47:21 the best game. I think it probably still
00:47:23 is, but I think Legends is probably my second
00:47:25 favorite. Legends is a really...
00:47:27 Legends
00:47:29 accomplishes what it sets out to do.
00:47:31 It succeeds at being the kind
00:47:33 of game that it's trying to be. I would say
00:47:35 I would say about as well.
00:47:37 It's not around the heart. It's not around as well as
00:47:39 the Zero's game. They do have a lot of heart.
00:47:41 It's really well realized. I love
00:47:43 the aesthetic.
00:47:45 They figured out Z-Targeting
00:47:47 in a 3D game.
00:47:49 Oh, yeah.
00:47:51 You know, I realized
00:47:53 as I was playing through Zero 2
00:47:55 that it really reminds me of Phenotopia.
00:47:57 You know that game? No.
00:47:59 It's an indie game
00:48:01 made by some guy.
00:48:03 It was released on Newgrounds.
00:48:05 It was published by Newgrounds.
00:48:07 It's a side-scrolling platformer,
00:48:09 but it's pixel-arc based.
00:48:11 Oh, I heard you talking about this.
00:48:13 Yeah, I used to compare it to Cave Story
00:48:15 because it sort of looks like
00:48:17 Cave Story side-scrolling pixel-based,
00:48:19 and it is an action game, but
00:48:21 the combat is really clunky
00:48:23 and the moment-to-moment
00:48:25 gameplay of it
00:48:27 is about
00:48:29 a lot of it is about finding
00:48:31 objects and bringing them to the
00:48:33 people that want them in exchange for stuff,
00:48:35 which feels like
00:48:37 Mega Man Legends a lot.
00:48:39 And it's also,
00:48:41 thinking back on it, the story of Phenotopia
00:48:43 is about delving into ruins
00:48:45 of a mysterious origin
00:48:47 and nobody knows where they are,
00:48:49 and it turns out your protagonist
00:48:51 has a secret connection to the creators
00:48:53 of these ruins.
00:48:55 That certainly sounds familiar.
00:48:57 Very, very similar.
00:48:59 Now that I've
00:49:01 played all of it.
00:49:03 Legends is just one of those games
00:49:05 that indie developers really like.
00:49:07 Yeah, I think
00:49:09 probably if I went back
00:49:11 and read that guy's blog, he probably
00:49:13 would mention Mega Man Legends somewhere.
00:49:15 I feel like the connections are pretty similar.
00:49:17 I like Mega Man Legends, but
00:49:19 I do have issues with the controls.
00:49:21 It has those old-fashioned
00:49:23 tank controls
00:49:25 from a PS1 era.
00:49:27 I like Legends 2 controls
00:49:29 much better.
00:49:31 I think the reason I bounced off Legends as a kid
00:49:33 was because, yeah, I liked the
00:49:35 sort of twitchy action
00:49:37 of Mega Man, and so I picked up Legends
00:49:39 and I think I found the combat really slow
00:49:41 and clunky, and I was like,
00:49:43 yeah.
00:49:45 It's really hard to turn
00:49:47 around and target enemies
00:49:49 and actually attack them effectively.
00:49:51 It's interesting because
00:49:53 I'd say Mega Man
00:49:55 on NES,
00:49:57 Mega Man probably has some of the best feeling
00:49:59 like platforming
00:50:01 games on the entire library
00:50:03 and same with X on Super Nintendo.
00:50:05 Yeah.
00:50:07 Legends would be the best
00:50:09 of the cream of the crop feeling
00:50:11 3D games,
00:50:13 but even Capcom kind of stumbled a little.
00:50:15 Not even close.
00:50:17 Their priorities were completely different.
00:50:19 But it still sort of pays off
00:50:21 because people really,
00:50:23 really like Legends regardless
00:50:25 because the aesthetic and the world
00:50:27 and everything else
00:50:29 is top-notch.
00:50:31 Yeah.
00:50:33 I do like everything else about it.
00:50:35 The voice acting is pretty good
00:50:37 and the cutscenes are fun.
00:50:39 It is.
00:50:41 That game has pretty decent voice acting,
00:50:43 I'd say.
00:50:45 You know, I'm thinking back to it
00:50:47 and I can't remember any times
00:50:49 when I thought the voice acting was bad
00:50:51 in a way that stood out,
00:50:53 so I am forced to conclude
00:50:55 that the voice acting was good.
00:50:57 There you go.
00:50:59 It's a little cheesy.
00:51:01 It's like a Saturday morning cartoon.
00:51:03 Um...
00:51:05 No one sounds like they're asleep
00:51:07 or are
00:51:09 asking what they're fighting for.
00:51:11 It's way better than
00:51:13 Dr. Light from Mega Man 8.
00:51:15 Zero.
00:51:17 If I become one of them,
00:51:19 you have to finish me, Zero.
00:51:21 Don't be ridiculous, X.
00:51:23 I'm cutting off communications.
00:51:27 If I were you, I would fight Dr. Huawei.
00:51:33 A lot of them.
00:51:35 A lot of them.
00:51:37 When I was a kid,
00:51:39 I didn't realize how bad voice acting
00:51:41 was in X4, so I actually kind of
00:51:43 liked it back then.
00:51:45 Now I can see it's
00:51:47 horrible. I still like it. I think it's pretty awesome.
00:51:49 If anything, the only problem with it is that it's too quiet.
00:51:51 The voice acting is too quiet.
00:51:53 I can't hear it.
00:51:55 It's so quiet.
00:51:57 I think they should have just left
00:51:59 the Japanese voice acting and added subtitles.
00:52:01 Oh, like X6?
00:52:03 Yeah.
00:52:05 If they were too lazy to get to dub it,
00:52:07 then just do that.
00:52:09 No dubbing is better than bad dubbing.
00:52:11 Exactly.
00:52:13 It depends on how story heavy
00:52:15 the game is, but
00:52:17 I guess if the dub is bad, then yeah.
00:52:19 Something like a Mega Man X game,
00:52:21 I don't think it really matters.
00:52:23 It doesn't necessarily need an English dub,
00:52:25 but I did think it was really funny
00:52:27 that they just didn't even bother
00:52:29 to dub X6 because they knew the game
00:52:31 was a fucking trap.
00:52:33 The issue with X5 and X6
00:52:35 is that they didn't even have anime cutscenes.
00:52:37 They just had static
00:52:39 images.
00:52:41 They put no effort at all into the cutscenes
00:52:43 in those games.
00:52:45 I didn't really even mind the static images as a kid,
00:52:47 because
00:52:49 all the art in the cutscenes
00:52:51 or the stills are on model
00:52:53 well enough. That said,
00:52:55 it is kind of lame that what is supposed
00:52:57 to be like Zero's final
00:52:59 hurrah is just resorted to
00:53:01 stills.
00:53:03 It just stepped down from the anime cutscenes
00:53:05 of X4, which were
00:53:07 impressive to look at.
00:53:09 They look really cool.
00:53:11 The Sigma Zero fight
00:53:13 is really badass.
00:53:15 It's like
00:53:17 the reaction to the cutscenes in
00:53:19 4 was bad, so instead of
00:53:21 improving them, we're
00:53:23 not going to do cutscenes anymore.
00:53:25 I don't think they were aware of
00:53:27 the reactions back then.
00:53:29 They probably didn't know the reactions
00:53:31 until after the internet became
00:53:33 more popular.
00:53:35 That's true, and it was just
00:53:37 the English that was terrible.
00:53:39 Probably in Japan, it was fine.
00:53:41 I think it's just budgetary reasons.
00:53:43 They just kept getting lower and lower
00:53:45 budget.
00:53:47 It seemed like for X4, they had a pretty big
00:53:49 budget.
00:53:51 They wanted to go big with that one.
00:53:53 It was X5 and X6.
00:53:55 They just wanted to make it
00:53:57 really cheaply.
00:53:59 I'm looking this up.
00:54:01 Apparently, the
00:54:03 Phenotopia remake
00:54:05 was released on Switch last year.
00:54:07 I saw. I was looking that up.
00:54:09 It's all steamed, too, I guess.
00:54:11 I knew that they were making
00:54:13 Phenotopia 2,
00:54:15 but apparently, they were
00:54:17 being developed at the same time,
00:54:19 but apparently they have stopped making
00:54:21 it when they're doing something else now.
00:54:23 I don't know what that is.
00:54:25 At least they're still around.
00:54:29 I don't know
00:54:31 why remake it, though.
00:54:33 Artists
00:54:35 love
00:54:37 finding something they made early on
00:54:39 and then trying to improve upon it.
00:54:41 Yeah, like George Lucas.
00:54:43 Yeah, like George Lucas.
00:54:45 God, I hope he didn't George Lucas
00:54:47 Phenotopia.
00:54:49 I would like to play the remake
00:54:51 just to see
00:54:53 what is different.
00:54:55 I know they added
00:54:57 cooking systems and stuff,
00:54:59 which could be fun,
00:55:01 but I don't know. I feel like Phenotopia was
00:55:03 I feel like it was just fine.
00:55:05 Yeah, that's the issue I had
00:55:07 was Maverick Hunter X
00:55:09 is that I felt Megaman X didn't need
00:55:11 a remake.
00:55:13 It was really, really good as is.
00:55:15 Well, I haven't played it.
00:55:17 The question is that it's there to
00:55:19 update the lore.
00:55:21 Sort of.
00:55:23 I feel like the lore didn't need an update
00:55:25 because they updated the lore
00:55:27 in the subsequent games.
00:55:29 I do like
00:55:31 the Day of Sigma
00:55:33 video,
00:55:35 but besides that, I felt everything else
00:55:37 was kind of unnecessary.
00:55:39 I think it is mostly
00:55:41 fine.
00:55:43 It's a good game on its own.
00:55:45 I would probably never play it over the original
00:55:47 X.
00:55:49 That said, it does have
00:55:51 some extra stuff.
00:55:53 The Vile mode is kind of cool.
00:55:55 The only problem with it is that
00:55:57 when you play,
00:55:59 you play as Vile,
00:56:01 instead of how X gets powers
00:56:03 from all the different Mavericks he fights,
00:56:05 Vile has
00:56:07 this equipment mechanic where
00:56:09 before a stage, you give him certain
00:56:11 pieces of equipment that
00:56:13 changes Musa out
00:56:15 around. Just pretty cool.
00:56:17 It's pretty cool.
00:56:19 It's a neat little addition.
00:56:21 The problem is that
00:56:23 he has this song
00:56:25 that plays
00:56:27 throughout the entire game.
00:56:29 They don't play the stage music.
00:56:31 They play some butt metal.
00:56:33 Wow.
00:56:35 They throw every level and you
00:56:37 get fucking sick of playing as Vile
00:56:39 two stages in.
00:56:41 It's really weird.
00:56:43 That really is a bummer.
00:56:45 I think it's the same song for all the stages.
00:56:47 Yup. It's the same exact song.
00:56:49 It's some generic
00:56:51 shitty butt metal riff.
00:56:53 It's so bad.
00:56:55 That is unfortunate.
00:56:57 There's no zero.
00:56:59 You don't get to play a zero. I know he dies,
00:57:01 but come on.
00:57:03 Vile also dies at the end.
00:57:05 Yeah. Vile dies too.
00:57:07 They could have done something to
00:57:09 play a zero.
00:57:11 Why wouldn't they make a zero mode?
00:57:13 That seems like such an obvious inclusion.
00:57:15 It does because when you play X,
00:57:17 there's a lot of moments where zero says
00:57:19 he's going to scout around or he's going to do
00:57:21 something off-screen.
00:57:23 That's true.
00:57:25 That would have been a perfect
00:57:27 opportunity to have a zero mode
00:57:29 where you get to see what he does off-screen.
00:57:31 At the beginning he says
00:57:33 I'll...
00:57:35 I'm going to find Sigma.
00:57:37 At Sigma's Fort, I think he says
00:57:39 I'll
00:57:41 make a frontal assault on Sigma
00:57:43 on the fortress while you
00:57:45 sneak in while I distract
00:57:47 the main forces.
00:57:49 It's something like...
00:57:51 I assume it was just
00:57:53 time restraints or something.
00:57:55 Zero was a staple in all the games at that point.
00:57:57 But if they had the time,
00:57:59 I think it would have been cool if
00:58:01 you get a zero mode and he goes through
00:58:03 remixed stages.
00:58:05 That would be different because
00:58:07 we got to get the game out.
00:58:09 I understand
00:58:11 that that's
00:58:13 gamer entitlement to ask,
00:58:15 why didn't you make even more game?
00:58:17 I feel like simply implementing
00:58:19 another character to play through the same stages.
00:58:21 I appreciate
00:58:23 the novelty of a vile mode.
00:58:25 I think that's cool.
00:58:27 Why would you not have a zero mode?
00:58:29 It seems like such an obvious inclusion.
00:58:31 Seems like it wouldn't have been that hard.
00:58:33 The intention they had was to
00:58:35 remake the entire X-Series
00:58:37 just like how they were going to remake
00:58:39 all the classic games with
00:58:41 Mega Man Powered Up.
00:58:43 It seems a little like George
00:58:45 Lucas-ing to me. I'm glad it didn't happen.
00:58:47 Yeah.
00:58:49 I think Powered Up is probably
00:58:51 a better
00:58:53 reimagining.
00:58:55 I'm sorry, Powered Up has Oilman
00:58:57 and that's racist.
00:58:59 Oilman? Yeah.
00:59:01 I don't think
00:59:03 they should have made Oilman.
00:59:05 They probably shouldn't have made Oilman.
00:59:07 I think they changed
00:59:09 them into purple in the US release
00:59:11 like with Janks and Pokemon.
00:59:13 They pulled the Janks, I see.
00:59:15 Yeah.
00:59:17 I don't really care for the cutesy
00:59:19 art style of Powered Up
00:59:21 either.
00:59:23 Again, I haven't played it, but I've seen it.
00:59:25 I don't see the appeal.
00:59:27 I don't like what I've seen.
00:59:29 What I think it does better than
00:59:31 Maverick Hunter, though, is that
00:59:33 it has a lot more bang for your buck.
00:59:35 It has a level designer.
00:59:37 Yeah, there's a level editor.
00:59:39 That's neat.
00:59:41 You can't play a zero on
00:59:43 Maverick Hunter X, but you can play
00:59:45 literally every robot master in Powered Up
00:59:47 and Roll.
00:59:49 That's cool.
00:59:51 If you could play as Chill Penguin
00:59:53 in Maverick Country,
00:59:55 that would be sick.
00:59:57 That would be so sick.
00:59:59 Yeah.
01:00:01 Imagine your plan is
01:00:03 Spark Mandrill trying to go through
01:00:05 the little boss doors.
01:00:07 It just has a little
01:00:09 discharge.
01:00:11 But obviously,
01:00:13 if you're going to play as any robot master
01:00:15 in Powered Up, you have to play as a oilman.
01:00:19 I just can't relate
01:00:21 to a character of a different race
01:00:23 than myself.
01:00:25 If you woke to play as an oilman,
01:00:27 I'm sorry, this is terrible.
01:00:29 I'm ashamed of myself.
01:00:33 Remake's bad.
01:00:35 Remake's bad and I disagree with him
01:00:37 philosophically.
01:00:39 Kind of, I guess.
01:00:41 I was playing the Resident Evil Remakes
01:00:43 recently.
01:00:45 I just beat Resident Evil 2
01:00:47 and everyone
01:00:49 really likes that one.
01:00:51 I just started three and I know
01:00:53 I like that one.
01:00:55 Having played
01:00:57 the older ones,
01:01:01 recently,
01:01:03 I feel like I have a pretty good frame of reference
01:01:05 to quantify
01:01:07 what is good about the remake
01:01:09 and what isn't, etc.
01:01:11 I liked Resident Evil 2 Remake.
01:01:13 I don't know if I liked it as much as the original,
01:01:15 but
01:01:17 it still kind of
01:01:19 justifies itself in my head
01:01:21 as a pretty
01:01:23 significant reimagining
01:01:25 of the events of that game
01:01:27 and has enough
01:01:29 where I can kind of see
01:01:31 them existing concurrently.
01:01:33 I would never say
01:01:35 don't play the original, just play the remake
01:01:37 for Resident Evil 2.
01:01:39 I would say play both
01:01:41 because they're both good games.
01:01:45 What's different?
01:01:47 Well, obviously,
01:01:49 it's a big
01:01:51 budget 3D
01:01:53 AAA game now.
01:01:55 It's got the over-the-shoulder camera.
01:01:57 The original
01:01:59 was pre-rendered
01:02:01 to tank controls.
01:02:03 That's a completely different
01:02:05 play experience.
01:02:07 It plays completely differently
01:02:09 and the layout of the police station
01:02:11 and the other levels are different
01:02:13 to some degree.
01:02:15 It's a lot like...
01:02:17 There was this section in the game.
01:02:19 Let's see how we can reincorporate it
01:02:21 in a new way.
01:02:23 There was a lot of stuff I was seeing
01:02:25 or I was like, oh, this kind of reminds me
01:02:27 of this part of Resident Evil 2
01:02:29 and now it's like this.
01:02:31 That's kind of cool.
01:02:33 It plays Resident Evil 4?
01:02:37 Here's the thing.
01:02:39 People always say that
01:02:41 and
01:02:43 I guess it's similar
01:02:45 in the sense that
01:02:47 it's third-person shooters over the shoulder
01:02:49 but the way
01:02:51 you're meant to play
01:02:53 in Resident Evil 4
01:02:55 is completely different from
01:02:57 the later remakes
01:02:59 because in RE4
01:03:01 the game
01:03:03 just showers you an ammo
01:03:05 at least on the normal difficulty.
01:03:07 It showers you an ammo
01:03:09 and it gives you all the opportunity
01:03:11 to shoot the guys
01:03:13 and then tackle them to the ground
01:03:15 and stuff. You're basically encouraged
01:03:17 to just kill everything
01:03:19 and it's fun.
01:03:21 I replayed Resident Evil 4 recently
01:03:23 and that game is so fucking good.
01:03:25 I remember Resident Evil 4
01:03:27 coming out and getting
01:03:29 10 out of 10s in Game Informer.
01:03:31 It was one of those games that got
01:03:33 critically acclaimed
01:03:35 way back in the day
01:03:37 and basically wrote the book
01:03:39 so like you would expect
01:03:41 you'd expect
01:03:43 it probably hasn't aged that well
01:03:45 it's kind of the first to really do
01:03:47 a lot of these things and it really hasn't
01:03:49 it just feels so fucking good.
01:03:51 I don't know how to describe it.
01:03:53 I have high hopes
01:03:55 for the
01:03:57 RE4 remake
01:03:59 and even if it
01:04:01 comes out and is great
01:04:03 I would still recommend people play the original because it's...
01:04:05 I feel like remaking
01:04:07 Resident Evil 4 seems kind of unnecessary.
01:04:09 Yeah.
01:04:11 It kind of is.
01:04:13 I'm not going to say it isn't because
01:04:15 the game holds up perfectly fine nowadays.
01:04:17 I feel like they're just kind of doing it to do it.
01:04:19 But if the game comes out good
01:04:21 then it's two good games, right?
01:04:23 That's
01:04:25 how I feel about the Pokemon remakes now.
01:04:27 I think that's a...
01:04:29 Do you really need Shining Diamond
01:04:31 and Glistening Pearl or whatever?
01:04:33 No.
01:04:35 The game industry is kind of headed
01:04:37 to where the movie industry was
01:04:39 where they're just remaking a lot of old stuff
01:04:41 because they can't come up with anything new that's good.
01:04:43 Is it like
01:04:45 the Squatters rights thing, right?
01:04:47 You've got an IP but if you don't do something
01:04:49 with the IP you can lose the rights to it.
01:04:51 Yeah.
01:04:53 I'm sure the Pokemon company doesn't have that problem
01:04:55 but...
01:04:57 You've got to keep the brand relevant
01:04:59 by releasing something every so often.
01:05:01 I'm thinking of Square
01:05:03 because they made a lot of Final Fantasy games
01:05:05 that everybody hated so then they were like
01:05:07 well everybody likes Final Fantasy 7
01:05:09 so let's just release nothing but
01:05:11 Final Fantasy 7 games until
01:05:13 forever I guess.
01:05:15 That's kind of how it feels.
01:05:17 I know that they...
01:05:19 I mean they do...
01:05:21 I guess a 14 is a pretty big hit.
01:05:23 Yeah.
01:05:25 14's its own completely different beast.
01:05:27 I think 14
01:05:29 initially everybody hated it
01:05:31 but then they were updated it
01:05:33 and massively changed it
01:05:35 and now it's people like it.
01:05:37 It got a new producer
01:05:39 and the guy basically turned the ship around
01:05:41 and turned it into their biggest cash cow.
01:05:43 It's wild that that is possible.
01:05:45 It's one of those
01:05:47 one in a million big success stories
01:05:49 for something like that.
01:05:51 I mean it's...
01:05:53 I think it's a more popular MMO these days
01:05:55 than even WoW
01:05:57 which is...
01:05:59 I definitely hear more people talking about 14.
01:06:01 Yeah, me too.
01:06:03 It feels like the first
01:06:05 time in a long time that
01:06:07 an MMO has felt like relevant
01:06:09 like people are talking about it.
01:06:11 Which is shocking.
01:06:13 I kind of never thought that would happen again.
01:06:15 It seems deserved.
01:06:17 Here's the thing.
01:06:19 Why would you name your MMO
01:06:21 Final Fantasy 14
01:06:23 and then release a single player game
01:06:25 that's Final Fantasy 15?
01:06:27 This had a chip on my shoulder
01:06:29 back when...
01:06:31 When 11 came out and it was an MMO
01:06:33 it always perplexed me.
01:06:35 They should have just called it Final Fantasy Online.
01:06:37 I know.
01:06:39 It seems so obvious.
01:06:41 It means that they thought it was a good idea.
01:06:45 They were just so committed
01:06:47 to the numbering system.
01:06:49 We can't...
01:06:51 Too late now.
01:06:53 Too late now. Sorry.
01:06:55 The other 11.
01:06:57 If we don't do it
01:06:59 people won't take the game seriously.
01:07:01 If we call it anything other than
01:07:03 Final Fantasy Number
01:07:05 people will think that's an admission of failure
01:07:07 for saying this isn't a fake game.
01:07:09 That was probably their thought process
01:07:11 when making 11.
01:07:13 I think so.
01:07:15 If we call it Final Fantasy Online
01:07:17 people will see it as a side project.
01:07:21 We got to get people to play it
01:07:23 by calling it 11.
01:07:25 You haven't played all the Final Fantasy
01:07:27 unless you've played 11.
01:07:29 Which is a shame
01:07:31 because from what I understand
01:07:33 11 holds up perfectly fine on its own.
01:07:35 It's a pretty well-liked game.
01:07:37 I don't think it really needed to be 11.
01:07:39 It's just a name
01:07:41 at this point.
01:07:43 It doesn't really matter.
01:07:45 But it is strange.
01:07:47 It is.
01:07:49 It's just so stupid from a marketing standpoint
01:07:51 because
01:07:53 Final Fantasy 14 is supposed to outlast
01:07:55 15 and 16
01:07:57 until it has an online one.
01:07:59 It seems dumb
01:08:01 to tie it to an old number.
01:08:05 I don't disagree.
01:08:07 If it's successful
01:08:09 I assume they intend to eventually
01:08:11 make a Final Fantasy 18
01:08:13 or whatever. That is another MMO.
01:08:17 They're going to continue
01:08:19 drilling into this bad idea
01:08:21 of, you know...
01:08:23 You think it's a bad idea?
01:08:25 Or are you in the numbering system?
01:08:27 I'm shocked they still...
01:08:29 I'm shocked they're still numbering them.
01:08:31 They're like one of the only companies
01:08:33 that still does that.
01:08:35 Yeah, at some point other ones
01:08:37 start to not hyphenate.
01:08:39 They start to use colons.
01:08:41 They get embarrassed of the number.
01:08:43 Final Fantasy 7?
01:08:45 Fuck, there's 7 of these? How embarrassing.
01:08:47 Final Fantasy...
01:08:49 Can't all be the final one.
01:08:53 Let's make a
01:08:55 control all delete webcomic
01:08:57 about that.
01:08:59 How can they all be the final fantasy?
01:09:01 Ahhhh!
01:09:03 Thank you Penny Arcade. Very cool.
01:09:09 What were we talking about?
01:09:11 Oh, a fucking
01:09:13 tie back to Resident Evil.
01:09:15 Resident Evil 7
01:09:17 is called Resident Evil
01:09:19 Biohazard.
01:09:21 But the VIL
01:09:23 in 7 is like
01:09:25 accented. So it looks like a 7
01:09:27 in the evil. And Biohazard is the Japanese name
01:09:29 to Resident Evil.
01:09:31 So what's the name of Japan?
01:09:33 It's called Biohazard Resident Evil 7.
01:09:35 Wow!
01:09:37 And then they have Resident Evil
01:09:39 Village
01:09:41 where they do the thing again
01:09:43 with the numerals 8 in the village.
01:09:45 Isn't that clever?
01:09:47 Wait a minute.
01:09:49 Yeah, it is.
01:09:51 It's cute.
01:09:53 That's pretty cute.
01:09:55 Yeah, they did it.
01:09:57 I think Japanese companies
01:09:59 are one of the only ones that
01:10:01 do this kind of thing
01:10:03 where they have a number
01:10:05 into like
01:10:07 they release so many sequels
01:10:09 with numbered titles.
01:10:11 Because I can't think of
01:10:13 like western
01:10:15 equivalence to that.
01:10:17 Well, you know, you got
01:10:19 the wizardry games. Those got to like 9
01:10:21 or something.
01:10:23 Same with Ultima.
01:10:25 But those are pretty old. I can't think of anything that got to
01:10:27 like 16.
01:10:29 True.
01:10:31 True, true. I think Final Fantasy might
01:10:33 be the one.
01:10:35 Unless there's like some obscure like
01:10:37 shitty shovelware game that's on like
01:10:39 Majang number 70 or something.
01:10:41 Bloons.
01:10:43 Yeah, Bloons got to like 6 tower defense games.
01:10:45 Okay, not even as many
01:10:47 as I thought.
01:10:49 Wait, what's that one?
01:10:51 What's that like
01:10:53 turn based flash game
01:10:55 with the anime characters?
01:10:57 You're gonna have to be a little more specific.
01:10:59 You have to be more specific.
01:11:01 It has the slimes.
01:11:03 Oh god, this isn't narrowing it down at all.
01:11:05 Adventure quest?
01:11:07 Oh, it sort of feels like Adventure
01:11:09 quest.
01:11:11 Oh god, this is gonna haunt me.
01:11:13 Ragnarok online.
01:11:15 Your main character
01:11:17 is like a blonde pirate guy
01:11:19 who like summons swords.
01:11:21 It was on
01:11:23 Newgrounds. He summons lots of swords.
01:11:27 Oh god!
01:11:29 That was like a combination of one piece of Final Fantasy
01:11:31 The side character,
01:11:33 the cute side character is a slime
01:11:35 but he's like a little cat
01:11:37 necko slime or something like that.
01:11:41 Oh no, sword
01:11:43 quest
01:11:45 sword adventure
01:11:47 anime
01:11:49 anime quest adventure
01:11:51 sword
01:11:53 I can't
01:11:55 I can't handle it.
01:11:59 Google. Google.
01:12:01 Pirate
01:12:03 anime
01:12:05 cat
01:12:07 slime sword
01:12:09 summon
01:12:11 quest. God help you.
01:12:13 Give me.
01:12:15 Please.
01:12:17 This is gonna be the hardest thing to find.
01:12:19 I'm not.
01:12:21 I'm gonna lose it.
01:12:23 I'm gonna freaking lose it.
01:12:25 Wait, I'll add Newgrounds to the list.
01:12:29 Battle
01:12:31 something
01:12:33 I never played
01:12:35 many Newgrounds flash games
01:12:37 back in the day.
01:12:39 I played my fair share.
01:12:41 Epic battle fantasy.
01:12:43 I think I actually remember hearing about that one.
01:12:45 Let me post the screenshot.
01:12:47 What a generic name.
01:12:49 Yeah, I think
01:12:51 I think that's the point.
01:12:53 Yeah, probably.
01:12:55 Is Cloud Strife unlockable?
01:12:57 I think you should win an award
01:12:59 for winning this one.
01:13:01 Epic battle fantasy.
01:13:03 Pow.
01:13:05 Blammo.
01:13:07 Oh, geez.
01:13:09 Hell yeah.
01:13:11 It reminds me of Maple's story.
01:13:13 It does.
01:13:15 It's a...
01:13:17 We have Dragon Quest at home.
01:13:19 Yeah, it's not really like that.
01:13:21 I mean, it looks like that, but it's got that
01:13:23 freaking chibi how to draw anime
01:13:25 style, but
01:13:27 it's just a very...
01:13:29 It's just a side-scrolling...
01:13:31 I mean, it's a turn-based...
01:13:33 It's basically just a turn-based
01:13:35 RPG, like battle
01:13:37 gauntlet with no...
01:13:39 I mean, there's a story, but
01:13:41 it's just about
01:13:43 using big magic to do big
01:13:45 attacks on enemies.
01:13:47 It sounds like Phantom's Revenge.
01:13:49 I was going to say, it's Phantom's Revenge.
01:13:51 But good.
01:13:53 Damn.
01:13:55 It's got...
01:13:57 Phantom's Revenge only has one sword.
01:13:59 Oh, man. It's been so long
01:14:01 since I've listened to the
01:14:03 PCP and I was catching up.
01:14:05 And I just recently got
01:14:07 past Ben releasing
01:14:09 Phantom's Revenge, so I got to ask...
01:14:11 That's like four months ago.
01:14:13 The post-mortem.
01:14:15 How does it feel four months out
01:14:17 from release?
01:14:19 The post-mortem is,
01:14:21 you know, it got the...
01:14:23 I think it got... It's a crude
01:14:25 like 500 downloads now,
01:14:27 which is, you know, that's nice.
01:14:29 Cool.
01:14:31 I think the game came out good,
01:14:33 came out pretty much exactly how I wanted it
01:14:35 to, which, I mean, what more can you ask
01:14:37 for? My
01:14:39 goal is...
01:14:41 You know, because I'm
01:14:43 still trying to get the book printed
01:14:45 and when I do the Kickstarter, I'm hoping
01:14:47 that the Kickstarter is
01:14:49 a big success and gets eyes on it
01:14:51 and maybe some more people check the game out
01:14:53 from
01:14:55 hearing about it through that.
01:14:57 That's my hope, anyway.
01:14:59 Are you still considering that idea
01:15:01 of like
01:15:03 scraping out
01:15:05 the Sonichu references to make it
01:15:07 more palatable, or was that just a slight
01:15:09 musing from months
01:15:11 gone by? That would...
01:15:13 That would be... If I did
01:15:15 that...
01:15:17 That would take a lot of work,
01:15:19 I feel like. It would...
01:15:21 I mean, it would just be a matter of changing
01:15:23 sprites and changing some dialogue.
01:15:25 If I did something like that,
01:15:27 it would basically be in...
01:15:29 I would basically just create
01:15:31 a sequel. I would just
01:15:33 make another game that
01:15:35 had similar, like, systems
01:15:37 and just different
01:15:39 enemies or something,
01:15:41 which I don't have any immediate plans to do. Yeah,
01:15:43 I did think about, like,
01:15:45 should I scrape this of Sonichu
01:15:47 because Sonichu is
01:15:49 brand poison? And I think,
01:15:51 like...
01:15:53 It wouldn't be the same game,
01:15:55 so...
01:15:57 Maybe I would come back to it
01:15:59 and make it
01:16:01 basically a different game or a different
01:16:03 version that is its own
01:16:05 thing. That is not
01:16:07 Sonichu related.
01:16:09 You'd be able to use a lot of the
01:16:11 codeface still, right?
01:16:13 I could... Like, assets?
01:16:15 Yeah.
01:16:17 Or just, like, the way the game works.
01:16:19 Yeah, I could definitely
01:16:21 recycle a lot of it
01:16:23 into...
01:16:25 Yeah, there's a lot I could reuse.
01:16:27 I don't see why you have to remove
01:16:29 the Sonichu references
01:16:31 since they're all, like, enemies
01:16:33 and bad guys.
01:16:35 I don't know. My thought
01:16:37 at the time, and I think it probably has some
01:16:39 truth to it, is just that, like,
01:16:41 any association with Sonichu
01:16:43 at all, to a certain kind of person
01:16:45 that's, like,
01:16:47 just so hideous.
01:16:49 Just so hideously off-putting and, like,
01:16:51 basically synonymous with
01:16:53 all sorts of
01:16:55 negative things.
01:16:57 I'm just thinking, it's like
01:16:59 if the bad guys were Nazis,
01:17:01 you wouldn't say, like, oh, man,
01:17:03 I gotta get rid of all these Nazis.
01:17:05 I don't want to have any references.
01:17:07 I don't think it's the same
01:17:09 because everybody
01:17:11 knows what World War II is.
01:17:13 It stands to reason that
01:17:15 if you are putting
01:17:17 Sonichu in your game, then you know
01:17:19 what a Sonichu is, which means
01:17:21 you know about Chris Chan, and some people
01:17:23 just, like, don't want
01:17:25 anything to do with that at all.
01:17:27 Yeah, everyone knows what a Nazi is.
01:17:29 Yeah, everybody knows what a Nazi is.
01:17:31 And Nazis are, like, a
01:17:33 relevant, historical villain.
01:17:35 If you're
01:17:37 making Sonichu-related content,
01:17:39 you are choosing to put this in front of people,
01:17:41 you're making choices,
01:17:43 and they're bad choices, and people don't appreciate it,
01:17:45 and that's what I did.
01:17:47 But to be fair,
01:17:49 you did it at a time, you know,
01:17:51 in a different time when it wasn't
01:17:53 four times.
01:17:55 I know what you mean.
01:17:57 I think
01:17:59 there is some cringe factor.
01:18:01 There's a cringe factor with
01:18:03 Sonichu that, like, if you are describing
01:18:05 the game, and it's like, oh, it has
01:18:07 Sonichu's in it, in any extent,
01:18:09 people will be like, oh, that's cringe.
01:18:11 That makes the game cringe.
01:18:13 Which honestly, I can't really,
01:18:15 I get it.
01:18:17 Wasn't that always the case, though?
01:18:19 Anything related to Sonichu
01:18:21 was always cringe, even,
01:18:23 you know, before current events.
01:18:25 Listen, there's people
01:18:29 I mean, you know
01:18:31 that Sonichu redrawn, someone
01:18:33 re-drew it from Rosichu's perspective?
01:18:35 No, I don't know
01:18:37 that, but...
01:18:39 Someone redrew, like, a chapter
01:18:41 of it from Rosichu's perspective, and
01:18:43 that redraw had good art
01:18:45 and it was, like, rewritten
01:18:47 to be good.
01:18:49 And it was, like, the person that made it
01:18:51 was talented and he did a good job
01:18:53 and it's a good comic. However,
01:18:55 it's still Sonichu
01:18:57 and it's still, like,
01:18:59 I don't know, I think
01:19:01 to a certain extent, it's like
01:19:03 this idiot wasted their time
01:19:05 making Sonichu content.
01:19:07 Like, what a freak.
01:19:09 Disgusting.
01:19:11 I feel a little part of me feels that way
01:19:13 about myself.
01:19:15 So, you know...
01:19:17 Well, shucks.
01:19:19 I contain multitudes, is what I'm saying.
01:19:21 Yeah, so...
01:19:23 Don't worry about it.
01:19:25 At least you didn't waste, like, 15 years
01:19:27 writing 500 reviews.
01:19:29 I
01:19:31 will waste my time
01:19:33 doing something. I swear to God.
01:19:35 Don't you, don't you doubt it.
01:19:37 I want, I want to talk about those
01:19:39 for a second, because I
01:19:41 I'm meaning to say this for a while, and since
01:19:43 you, Gamer's Tavern, are on this
01:19:45 podcast with me, I suppose I can
01:19:47 now.
01:19:49 I was, I actually went back
01:19:51 and I was looking at some of your, like, old
01:19:53 you're on your website, like, your old, like,
01:19:55 blog posts or, like, your reviews
01:19:57 or whatever. Just, like, your writings, I guess.
01:19:59 And, you know,
01:20:01 I guess I don't really know what I
01:20:03 expected, but
01:20:05 you're really mean in those,
01:20:07 I've noticed.
01:20:09 Really? Yeah.
01:20:11 It was a different time.
01:20:13 I haven't read a lot of your text
01:20:15 reviews.
01:20:17 Gamer's Tavern's
01:20:19 text posts were, like, because, you know,
01:20:21 you hear him on the podcast and he's a pretty
01:20:23 mild-mannered guy, you know, he's a little corny,
01:20:25 funny corny jokes. So, you know,
01:20:27 I expected, like, some
01:20:29 some, like, some dry
01:20:31 witty, sort of,
01:20:33 like, uh,
01:20:35 deadpan analysis of some
01:20:37 sort, but he's a lot fireier.
01:20:39 The fire in his heart burned
01:20:41 bright, I'd say.
01:20:43 I feel like that was, sort of, just
01:20:45 indicative of the time.
01:20:47 And, you know, just being younger.
01:20:49 Like, it was an era of angry reviews
01:20:51 and an era of, like,
01:20:53 insult, insulting something.
01:20:55 Yeah.
01:20:57 I mean, he's right here,
01:20:59 so I guess he could speak for himself.
01:21:01 Well, you know, that was,
01:21:03 I started the site nearly 20 years ago.
01:21:05 So,
01:21:07 you know, I was different back then.
01:21:09 Yeah.
01:21:11 You know, when I first started
01:21:13 writing, I kind of had a bit of
01:21:15 a persona on my website.
01:21:17 That's why I figured
01:21:19 that's what that was.
01:21:21 It was different from how I am
01:21:23 in person, so it was
01:21:25 kind of like a
01:21:27 Maddox, you know, Maddox.
01:21:29 It's kind of like
01:21:31 that kind of thing.
01:21:33 But I didn't
01:21:35 know who Maddox was at the time.
01:21:37 You know, so I thought it was being
01:21:39 completely original.
01:21:41 It's hard for
01:21:43 me to imagine you with, like,
01:21:45 a, I'm being mean
01:21:47 gimmick. That's crazy.
01:21:49 Yeah, it was being kind of
01:21:51 mean and cynical and
01:21:53 egotistical and narcissistic.
01:21:55 But I was kind of doing it
01:21:57 in, like, a self-deprecating
01:21:59 way.
01:22:01 It's part of the joke.
01:22:03 It's so funny.
01:22:05 So I did that for a while,
01:22:07 but then when I realized
01:22:09 Maddox already did that before
01:22:11 I did, I kind of stopped
01:22:13 because...
01:22:15 Yeah, I guess that is a bit...
01:22:17 I didn't want people to accuse me of copying him.
01:22:19 Yeah.
01:22:21 People probably accuse Maddox
01:22:23 of copying someone else.
01:22:25 Yeah, and there's a lot of, like,
01:22:27 Maddox copycat writers
01:22:29 that used to exist back then
01:22:31 in, like, 2005.
01:22:33 I'm sure Maddox wasn't the first
01:22:35 person to, like, do
01:22:37 comedy in a sort of, like,
01:22:39 I'm being an over-the-top
01:22:41 asshole on purpose sort of
01:22:43 way.
01:22:45 Yeah, probably not.
01:22:47 Yeah.
01:22:49 Who would contemporary critics
01:22:51 have compared Maddox's comedy to
01:22:53 at the height of his power?
01:22:55 Sean Baby, I guess?
01:22:57 Yeah, that's another one.
01:22:59 Did Sean Baby exist when Maddox
01:23:01 was writing the best page in the universe?
01:23:03 Yeah, Sean Baby was, like, late 90s.
01:23:05 Yeah, Maddox started, I think, in 97.
01:23:07 Was he? Yeah, I think so.
01:23:09 I'm not super knowledgeable on Sean Baby,
01:23:11 but...
01:23:13 I still don't know anything about Sean.
01:23:15 I've heard the name, I don't know who that is.
01:23:17 Yeah, he's, like, an old
01:23:19 internet writer. I'd say it's, like,
01:23:21 him and Maddox are, like, kind of, like,
01:23:23 old guard that are somewhat still around.
01:23:25 I think Sean... Didn't Sean Baby, like,
01:23:27 found Cracked or something?
01:23:29 I don't know. I'm not sure
01:23:31 what Sean Baby did later,
01:23:33 but I know, you know,
01:23:35 I think he used to write for EGM or something.
01:23:37 He used to be a video game magazine
01:23:39 writer, then he started writing on the
01:23:41 internet.
01:23:43 Are there any, like, stand-up comedians
01:23:45 that have a persona that's, like,
01:23:47 oh, I mean to children, like,
01:23:49 dead baby jokes? Yeah, all of them.
01:23:51 Yeah, basically.
01:23:53 I mean, dead baby jokes, that was
01:23:55 Andrew Dice Clay's saying, wasn't it?
01:23:57 I'm not familiar
01:23:59 with the man's work.
01:24:01 But, perhaps.
01:24:03 Yeah.
01:24:05 I think most male comedians, you could
01:24:07 probably find them making a joke about how they hate kids.
01:24:09 I'm just saying, you know,
01:24:11 the animatics stick
01:24:13 came... did not come
01:24:15 spring fully formed.
01:24:17 I'm sure he was influenced
01:24:19 by comedians and stuff,
01:24:21 but he was probably the first, like,
01:24:23 major internet person
01:24:25 to do that style of humor.
01:24:27 Because he started in the late 90s,
01:24:29 and, you know, the internet
01:24:31 barely existed back then.
01:24:33 I know that
01:24:35 my friends
01:24:37 were really into Maddox when he was
01:24:39 running the best page in the universe.
01:24:41 Well,
01:24:43 a lot of his old writing, I think,
01:24:45 is, you know, was pretty good for the time,
01:24:47 and some of it still holds up.
01:24:49 I don't know why he, like,
01:24:51 stopped and, you know,
01:24:53 started doing other weird
01:24:55 stupid nonsense.
01:24:57 Yeah.
01:24:59 I don't know, maybe he just
01:25:01 maybe he'd run that
01:25:03 stick into the ground.
01:25:05 I mean, he's doing it for a long time.
01:25:07 He's doing YouTube videos later,
01:25:09 and those weren't as good as the articles,
01:25:11 but, you know, some of them were fine,
01:25:13 I guess. They were pretty popular, though.
01:25:15 Yeah.
01:25:17 I don't know why he didn't continue doing them,
01:25:19 because they were getting good views,
01:25:21 and, you know, some of them were okay.
01:25:23 You know, some of them were decent.
01:25:25 I think...
01:25:27 He famously had that cuck one,
01:25:29 which kind of
01:25:31 started a lot of things.
01:25:33 Yeah, that one wasn't that great, but...
01:25:35 There were a couple of other ones that were
01:25:37 fine, you know.
01:25:39 I think just the issues he was having
01:25:41 with Dick Masterson
01:25:43 maybe
01:25:45 demoralized him, and he didn't want to work
01:25:47 on content anymore.
01:25:49 It's funny, I still see him
01:25:51 every once in a while,
01:25:53 just like on a scant
01:25:55 Twitter post every now and then.
01:25:57 I'm just like, oh yeah, he's still around, huh?
01:25:59 So, you know,
01:26:01 there's that.
01:26:03 I'm reading an article
01:26:05 by Sean Baby
01:26:07 from February 12, 2012
01:26:09 called four, quote,
01:26:11 geek humor books
01:26:13 by authors who understand neither.
01:26:15 I'm already laughing.
01:26:17 It's possible Maddox
01:26:19 was inspired by Sean Baby, you know.
01:26:21 Pure...
01:26:23 Yeah.
01:26:25 Let me see here.
01:26:27 I'd say they're contemporaries.
01:26:29 I've never heard him mention Sean Baby,
01:26:31 but
01:26:33 here's a sample
01:26:35 from this article.
01:26:37 I guess this is a real
01:26:39 book that's being
01:26:41 reviewed.
01:26:43 This is very,
01:26:45 it's kind of like Maddox's thing,
01:26:47 but Sean Baby did it first.
01:26:49 Hmm.
01:26:51 Write a book? Yeah, Sean Baby
01:26:53 already did that pal, sorry.
01:26:55 No, Sean Baby didn't write this book.
01:26:57 He's reviewed, he's lampooned.
01:26:59 This is a real book from
01:27:01 1993
01:27:03 by some guy
01:27:05 and he's featuring.
01:27:07 It's being featured here.
01:27:09 It's like when Maddox
01:27:11 reviews an old book or something
01:27:13 and, you know... Oh my god.
01:27:15 Maddox did an article reviewing old
01:27:17 book covers, I think.
01:27:19 Yes.
01:27:21 Well, wasn't that one of the,
01:27:23 that was one of the
01:27:25 basis for his
01:27:27 one of his books that he sold?
01:27:29 Or no, he like, made fun
01:27:31 of kids drawings in one of them.
01:27:33 How do you get...
01:27:35 What do you get when you cross Pac-Man with a sweater?
01:27:37 An owl pack a
01:27:39 sweater. Ah, jeez.
01:27:41 Woo! I think we found
01:27:43 where Gamers Tavern gets his jokes from.
01:27:45 Yeah, pretty much.
01:27:47 Maddox was inspired by Sean Baby.
01:27:49 Gamers Tavern
01:27:51 was inspired by good old John Byrne.
01:27:53 Yeah, pretty much.
01:27:55 I mean, like a
01:27:57 Titan of the industry.
01:27:59 Uh...
01:28:01 Uh...
01:28:03 Those were different times.
01:28:05 I gotta tear my eyes away. I can't read this
01:28:07 whole article right now. That's just rude.
01:28:09 That's just rude.
01:28:11 To my listeners and my guests.
01:28:13 I haven't been posting on the website much lately,
01:28:15 but I do make YouTube videos
01:28:17 sometimes.
01:28:19 I saw you made a video
01:28:21 talking about or
01:28:23 showing off all of the
01:28:25 enemy descriptions
01:28:27 in Mario RPG.
01:28:29 And you got Cybershell to voice them.
01:28:31 Wait a minute.
01:28:33 Yeah, that sounds...
01:28:35 That sounds great.
01:28:37 I want to see that video.
01:28:39 Yeah, that was
01:28:41 that was a very
01:28:43 time-consuming project.
01:28:45 I could see that.
01:28:47 That's in decent views.
01:28:49 Okay, I'm gonna check this one out.
01:28:51 Enemy thoughts
01:28:53 in Mario RPG.
01:28:55 That's awesome.
01:28:57 In Mario RPG, you have this ability
01:28:59 where you can see the enemy's
01:29:01 one-on-one. Yes, Psychopath.
01:29:03 Very interesting name for that.
01:29:05 Yeah, Malo's Psychopath ability.
01:29:07 You know, I remember
01:29:09 when I was a kid,
01:29:11 my dad is a psychologist
01:29:13 and I played that game and I saw that ability
01:29:15 and I didn't know what that word meant
01:29:17 and I asked my dad like,
01:29:19 hey, what does that mean?
01:29:21 He seemed disturbed by the question.
01:29:23 I
01:29:25 feel like it's some sort of mistranslation
01:29:27 because shouldn't it be called telepathy
01:29:29 or something?
01:29:31 Because Malo's reading the guy's minds, right?
01:29:33 Yeah, it would be...
01:29:35 Yeah, the name doesn't make sense.
01:29:37 What's the word when you read people's thoughts?
01:29:39 It's not clairvoyance.
01:29:41 Oh, not telepathy.
01:29:43 Telepathy is telekinesis, right?
01:29:45 No, telepathy is when you can
01:29:47 speak with your mind.
01:29:49 But reading other people's thoughts
01:29:51 is...
01:29:53 there's a specific word.
01:29:55 Is it clairvoyance?
01:29:57 No, clairvoyance, I think, is like
01:29:59 seeing and fearing at a...
01:30:01 No, it's seeing at a distance.
01:30:03 You're clairvoyant if you can like see what's happening somewhere else
01:30:05 from where you are.
01:30:07 I think so. Wait.
01:30:09 Clair...
01:30:11 clairvoyance is...
01:30:13 That's how it works in Psychonauts.
01:30:15 Oh, perceiving things or events
01:30:17 in the future or beyond normal sensory
01:30:19 contact, okay.
01:30:21 Yeah, that's what I thought.
01:30:23 Okay, I guess it does include the future.
01:30:27 Regardless,
01:30:29 I saw the ability
01:30:31 Psychopath and Mario RPG
01:30:33 and I thought I was going to get some fucking badass
01:30:35 sicko mode move
01:30:37 and then I just got the
01:30:39 bestiary move, basically.
01:30:41 Okay, no, you were right.
01:30:43 Telepathy encompasses
01:30:45 both speaking with the mind
01:30:47 and hearing others with your mind,
01:30:49 so there you go. Yeah, that makes sense.
01:30:51 Telepathy is what they...
01:30:53 I don't know why it's called that.
01:30:55 It's pretty baffling.
01:30:57 But I actually...
01:30:59 I think the last time I was on
01:31:01 the PCP
01:31:03 I mentioned I was working on
01:31:05 a new project,
01:31:07 the video.
01:31:09 Yeah, probably.
01:31:11 And I don't remember if it was on the episode
01:31:13 or off the episode, but I described...
01:31:15 Let me see your channel.
01:31:17 I kind of, like,
01:31:19 described it ambiguously.
01:31:21 You know, so this is
01:31:23 that video I was working on.
01:31:25 That was months ago.
01:31:29 Because I basically wanted to make a video
01:31:31 that would contain, you know,
01:31:33 the old gamer's tavern humor,
01:31:35 but wasn't a let's play
01:31:37 video.
01:31:39 Because let's plays aren't really
01:31:41 that popular anymore.
01:31:43 So you mean it's this Mario one?
01:31:45 Yeah.
01:31:47 Listen, I'm excited
01:31:49 because Mario RPG
01:31:51 is one of my favorite games
01:31:53 ever, and I don't know,
01:31:55 just I want to
01:31:57 hear jokes about
01:31:59 the things that are in it.
01:32:01 I'm the market for this.
01:32:03 It was basically the inspiration
01:32:05 was to, you know,
01:32:07 pick a game that a lot of people like,
01:32:09 but show something off
01:32:11 about that game that a lot of people don't know
01:32:13 about, including people who do
01:32:15 like it.
01:32:17 I'm certain there are some messages
01:32:19 in here that I've never read before.
01:32:21 Yeah, and then also combine that with
01:32:23 the gamer's tavern humor
01:32:25 that everybody knows and loves.
01:32:27 Okay.
01:32:29 We'll link that
01:32:31 in the description. I will watch that
01:32:33 after the podcast is over.
01:32:35 I want to consume
01:32:37 that content. It was a pretty
01:32:39 ambitious project, you know, because I had to go
01:32:41 through all the enemy
01:32:43 dialogue, which was
01:32:45 I think there's around 210 lines.
01:32:47 Is there
01:32:49 I was going to ask how many there are.
01:32:51 There's 210. Do you do like commentary
01:32:53 on each one? I kind of do
01:32:55 like a quick rapid fire joke
01:32:57 or comeback on each one.
01:32:59 Hmm.
01:33:01 I don't want to spend too much time on each one
01:33:03 because the video is already 28 minutes.
01:33:05 I understand.
01:33:07 I understand.
01:33:09 So I got a cyber shell to read
01:33:11 the enemy lines.
01:33:13 It's a good
01:33:15 that way it's a, you know, he reads
01:33:17 a line and then I respond to it.
01:33:19 Basically the gist of the
01:33:21 video.
01:33:23 Ah,
01:33:25 it's on my list.
01:33:27 He did. He did a
01:33:29 lot of work, you know, so
01:33:31 yeah, major thanks to cyber show.
01:33:33 Yeah, to read 210
01:33:35 line. So that's
01:33:37 quite an ordeal.
01:33:39 Man.
01:33:41 I want to read lines.
01:33:43 I want to read lines in people's videos.
01:33:45 And I was pretty
01:33:47 surprised how quickly he
01:33:49 got all the lines done.
01:33:51 Is that I kind of just ask them
01:33:53 and then by like a day
01:33:55 later, a couple of hours later, he was
01:33:57 done with all of them.
01:33:59 Oh, wow. Does
01:34:01 cyber shell just like
01:34:03 I see I hear his voice popping up in a lot of
01:34:05 videos. Does he just like
01:34:07 I don't know, does he
01:34:09 like advertise that like that's
01:34:11 something he does or do you just
01:34:13 a lot of people ask him to do that.
01:34:15 I think they can just ask him. Just because
01:34:17 they've heard him in other stuff and they were like, let's
01:34:19 get that guy.
01:34:21 I don't know, but I got
01:34:23 him because
01:34:25 first of all, I know him and
01:34:27 we know each other and
01:34:29 I was
01:34:31 inspired actually to make this video from one
01:34:33 of his videos. He did a video on
01:34:35 the
01:34:37 NPC dialogue and Sonic Adventure
01:34:39 and that's where I got the idea
01:34:41 for this video.
01:34:43 I'm trying to remember if I've seen
01:34:45 that cyber shell video.
01:34:47 I think it came out like last year or something.
01:34:49 I feel like I would have seen it, but I don't
01:34:51 really remember it, but
01:34:53 okay.
01:34:55 He just seemed pretty appropriate
01:34:57 and he's
01:34:59 pretty good at reading lines. He has a way
01:35:01 of doing it that's kind of funny.
01:35:05 So that's what I needed. I needed
01:35:07 a funny reading of enemy
01:35:09 dialogue and Mario
01:35:11 RPG.
01:35:13 What we need is a Mario RPG remake.
01:35:15 We need that
01:35:17 remake. We need an HD. We need Over the
01:35:19 Folder.
01:35:23 You know, actually
01:35:25 when I was a kid, I was really disappointed
01:35:27 that we never really got a sequel
01:35:29 to Mario RPG.
01:35:31 Paper Mario
01:35:33 is supposed to be like the sequel, but
01:35:35 it's totally different. It doesn't feel
01:35:37 anything like
01:35:39 the original.
01:35:41 I'd say Mario and Luigi series is closer
01:35:43 to capturing the Mario RPG
01:35:45 feel, especially since
01:35:47 Alpha Dream was made of
01:35:49 X Mario RPG
01:35:51 devs.
01:35:53 It doesn't play the same
01:35:55 because you play
01:35:57 Mario and Luigi instead of
01:35:59 Mario and Luigi.
01:36:01 It's still not quite the same.
01:36:03 There's something missing.
01:36:05 I always
01:36:07 was just like,
01:36:09 why wasn't there another one?
01:36:11 I didn't get a
01:36:13 N64 so I couldn't play
01:36:15 Paper Mario.
01:36:17 Was Paper Mario 2 on the N64?
01:36:19 It was on Gamecube.
01:36:21 I didn't get one of those either.
01:36:23 I'm a little younger
01:36:25 so I was more attached to Paper Mario.
01:36:27 I only played Mario RPG
01:36:29 when it came on Virtual Console
01:36:31 and I thought it was alright.
01:36:33 I did eventually go back and play the Paper Mario
01:36:35 games and they're good and I like them.
01:36:39 But they're not the same.
01:36:41 I do like the Paper Mario games as well, but
01:36:43 they lack the feel of
01:36:45 Mario RPG.
01:36:47 I did have
01:36:49 Game Boy Advance.
01:36:51 I did play
01:36:53 at least the first
01:36:55 Mario...
01:36:57 Mario and Luigi.
01:36:59 Superstar Saga.
01:37:01 That's good.
01:37:03 The good thing about Mario RPG
01:37:05 not really having a real follow-up
01:37:07 is that it will remain
01:37:09 forever distinct.
01:37:11 There's nothing like it
01:37:13 and it seems like
01:37:15 there will never be anything like it.
01:37:17 Can you imagine
01:37:19 I don't even know
01:37:21 if I would want them to
01:37:23 try to follow it up?
01:37:25 Yeah, that's a good point.
01:37:27 Sometimes a sequel or
01:37:29 a bunch of sequels can kind of ruin
01:37:31 the legacy of the original.
01:37:33 Especially now,
01:37:35 30 years later,
01:37:37 I just think
01:37:39 they couldn't do it.
01:37:41 Whoever
01:37:43 made that game
01:37:45 is no longer the same.
01:37:47 Those same people don't exist.
01:37:49 The world is such
01:37:51 a different place that it would never
01:37:53 be the same.
01:37:55 So whatever.
01:37:57 Just...
01:37:59 There's no hope
01:38:01 of ever fully
01:38:03 recapturing the magic exactly.
01:38:05 So just leave it.
01:38:07 It's always going to be different.
01:38:09 Yeah.
01:38:11 I think the reason for that is because
01:38:13 Mario RPG was co-developed
01:38:15 by Square
01:38:17 and Paper Mario
01:38:19 was made just by Nintendo.
01:38:21 Yeah, intelligent systems.
01:38:23 It lacked that Square touch.
01:38:25 Yeah.
01:38:27 Yeah.
01:38:29 There's no Qlix.
01:38:31 Yeah, Qlix isn't in it.
01:38:33 There's no Qlix. Mario's
01:38:35 Paper Mario is not the sequel
01:38:37 because there's no Qlix.
01:38:41 I mean, I don't know.
01:38:43 Did Square write
01:38:45 the dialogue?
01:38:47 I don't know how to...
01:38:49 It didn't...
01:38:51 Chrono, you might know this.
01:38:53 The Final Fantasy VI
01:38:55 localizer Ted Woolsey
01:38:57 write the dialogue for Mario RPG.
01:38:59 Well, you mean translated it, right?
01:39:01 Yeah.
01:39:03 I think so, but I'm not...
01:39:05 For all intents and purposes, his dialogue
01:39:07 in the English version.
01:39:09 Yeah, he's known for...
01:39:11 He did Final Fantasy VI
01:39:13 and also Secret of Mana.
01:39:15 Yes.
01:39:17 Maybe he did more RPG,
01:39:19 but I'm not positive.
01:39:21 Let's see.
01:39:23 I think... I know Ted Woolsey.
01:39:25 But I think
01:39:27 maybe Square wrote the script for the game,
01:39:29 the original Japanese script.
01:39:31 Yeah.
01:39:33 I kind of doubt that Nintendo did.
01:39:35 Yes, yes. He did.
01:39:37 He did...
01:39:39 He did translate Mario RPG.
01:39:41 Yeah, that makes sense because he translated
01:39:43 most of the Square's big games back then.
01:39:45 Yeah.
01:39:47 Seems like Mario RPG
01:39:49 was his last translation
01:39:51 job for them.
01:39:53 I think I read
01:39:55 in an interview with...
01:39:57 I think it was Shigeru Miyamoto
01:39:59 when Square wanted Mario to have a sword.
01:40:01 Yes.
01:40:03 It was against that, so he told them
01:40:05 to change it into a hammer or something.
01:40:07 Wait a minute.
01:40:09 The story I heard was like
01:40:11 he was presenting it at
01:40:13 like a conference or something and he
01:40:15 this sounds fake. This sounds like a fake story.
01:40:17 But he was like giving a presentation
01:40:19 to an audience and he showed
01:40:21 a slide of Mario with a sword
01:40:23 and a slide of Mario with a hammer.
01:40:25 And like
01:40:27 the audience cheered louder
01:40:29 for the hammer or something.
01:40:31 I swear I read that somewhere.
01:40:33 I didn't hear it like that, but I don't know
01:40:35 maybe that's what happened.
01:40:37 That sort of sounds like another story
01:40:39 with Miyamoto from around
01:40:41 that time when
01:40:43 Rare was making Donkey Kong 64.
01:40:45 They gave...
01:40:47 You can see this in previous footage, so this is real.
01:40:49 This happened.
01:40:51 You can see Donkey Kong
01:40:53 with like a realistic gun
01:40:55 because he has the coconut gun
01:40:57 that fires and spurts.
01:40:59 Well originally they were just going to be real guns.
01:41:01 And
01:41:03 when they showed it to Miyamoto
01:41:05 he was apparently really
01:41:07 surprised and offended
01:41:09 that they would give him a gun
01:41:11 which apparently...
01:41:13 Why would you do that?
01:41:15 So instead,
01:41:17 when he saw that
01:41:19 he came back with
01:41:21 a little quick drawing
01:41:23 of him with like a coconut gun
01:41:25 instead and they just did that.
01:41:27 So it sort of sounds similar
01:41:29 to that story. I don't know
01:41:31 if you got stories mixed up or anything
01:41:33 but I could totally see
01:41:35 something like that happening because
01:41:37 90s game development was fucking wild.
01:41:39 Yeah.
01:41:41 Hey, you want to know a fact.
01:41:43 When translating Super Mario RPG
01:41:45 Woolsey wanted to name
01:41:47 Punchinello James Bomb.
01:41:49 Though the idea was nixed.
01:41:51 One reference to James Bond
01:41:53 Punchinello introducing himself
01:41:55 as the names Nello
01:41:57 Punchinello remains in the final game.
01:42:01 I didn't know that.
01:42:03 It's pretty interesting.
01:42:05 I would be curious
01:42:07 to know
01:42:09 what...
01:42:11 if someone has ever re-translated Mario RPG
01:42:13 to be more
01:42:15 a more faithful translation.
01:42:17 And to see if the translation
01:42:19 is just like really dry and lame
01:42:21 and that like
01:42:23 Woolsey is what
01:42:25 kind of helped to make that game's
01:42:27 style feel so...
01:42:29 That would be really interesting
01:42:31 actually.
01:42:33 I heard that was a case for Paper Mario.
01:42:35 The original Japanese script was
01:42:37 boring and then the translators
01:42:39 they added a lot of humor
01:42:41 and references
01:42:43 that weren't an original script.
01:42:45 I...
01:42:47 I know there's a few stories like that
01:42:49 where like the original
01:42:51 the original
01:42:53 script was just kind of
01:42:55 bland and it was
01:42:57 quote-unquote punched up in localization
01:42:59 for better or for worse. Mostly for better.
01:43:01 I think that was
01:43:03 mostly in the thousand year door
01:43:05 sequel.
01:43:07 I could see that. Not to say
01:43:09 that the original Paper Mario wasn't funny
01:43:11 or anything or charming
01:43:13 as it was but like thousand year door
01:43:15 was a lot
01:43:17 quipier I'd say
01:43:19 in a good way.
01:43:21 I like thousand year door
01:43:23 who doesn't like thousand year door?
01:43:25 Also in the last few years I found out
01:43:27 something that I didn't know about Mario RPG
01:43:29 was that the soundtrack was composed
01:43:31 by Yoko Shimamura
01:43:33 I think her name is.
01:43:35 She's the one who did Kingdom Hearts
01:43:37 soundtracks later on.
01:43:39 And Street Fighter 2.
01:43:41 She's like
01:43:43 video game royalty.
01:43:45 She's very very good at what she does.
01:43:47 She's been doing it for a long time.
01:43:49 That's from what you said.
01:43:51 Sorry.
01:43:53 I used to think
01:43:55 that Mario RPG was done
01:43:57 by the typical square
01:43:59 composer of the time. His name is
01:44:01 Nobuu Umezu.
01:44:03 Yeah, Uematsu.
01:44:05 I didn't know it was actually
01:44:07 Yoko that did it
01:44:09 recently. But it makes sense
01:44:11 because it does sound like her music.
01:44:13 She has kind of like a signature
01:44:15 style.
01:44:17 Shimamura also did
01:44:19 what else did you say?
01:44:21 Kingdom Hearts.
01:44:23 That's what she's most known for nowadays.
01:44:25 She also did a Legend of Mana
01:44:27 for the PS1.
01:44:29 And actually there's a track
01:44:31 in Legend of Mana that sounds exactly
01:44:33 like a Mario RPG track.
01:44:35 Which Mario RPG track?
01:44:37 It sounds like the Mushroom Kingdom one.
01:44:39 Okay.
01:44:41 It's the magic city
01:44:43 track from Legend of Mana.
01:44:45 Let me see if I can find it.
01:44:47 I'm trying to remember how the
01:44:53 Is that?
01:44:55 I know that one.
01:44:57 Mario Kingdom or the Mushroom Kingdom?
01:44:59 Yeah.
01:45:01 Yeah, it's something like that.
01:45:03 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:45:05 So, if you're playing a RPG,
01:45:07 fuck that chest
01:45:09 that you can only get in that one room
01:45:11 by jumping on that one toad's head
01:45:13 that runs through that room one time.
01:45:15 And you can never get the chest again.
01:45:17 Yeah, I remember.
01:45:19 And then your radar beeps for the rest of the game.
01:45:21 Okay, that always
01:45:23 stumped me as a kid.
01:45:25 I never know this.
01:45:27 Her first project was Live Alive.
01:45:29 She just got a remake recently.
01:45:31 What is Live Alive?
01:45:33 She did the soundtrack to that game.
01:45:37 Live Alive was a JRPG made by Square Enix.
01:45:41 It never came out over here.
01:45:43 It was only in Japan for Super Nintendo.
01:45:47 It was directed by the Final Fantasy IV guy.
01:45:50 That's what he did after.
01:45:53 And it's basically like you play as like eight different characters in different scenarios
01:46:01 and it has like sort of like a grid based combat.
01:46:03 I think you would like it then.
01:46:05 I beat this game actually on an emulator back in like two thousand and three or four maybe
01:46:12 two thousand five.
01:46:13 Yeah.
01:46:14 It's kind of one of those like great like top five RPG games you never got one of those
01:46:21 games.
01:46:22 I want to play it.
01:46:23 I want to play it.
01:46:24 Yeah.
01:46:25 It got a fan translation years ago.
01:46:28 I am.
01:46:29 That's how I beat it.
01:46:30 I beat it back then.
01:46:31 It's pretty good.
01:46:32 It's pretty interesting.
01:46:33 I am listening to this track.
01:46:34 It does.
01:46:35 It does sound.
01:46:36 Yeah.
01:46:37 I can definitely hear the similarity with the Mushroom Kingdom.
01:46:40 Oh yeah.
01:46:41 Yeah.
01:46:42 Actually I played Legend of Mana when I was younger and I never made the connection between
01:46:46 this track and Mario RPG until now for some reason but it does sound very similar.
01:46:54 Legend of Mana is the PlayStation one right?
01:46:57 Yeah.
01:46:58 Yeah.
01:46:59 Yeah.
01:47:00 It came out I think in either 99 or 2000 I think it was 2000.
01:47:03 I always get Legend of Mana mixed up with Dawn of Mana which I think is the PS2 one
01:47:10 that's apparently really bad.
01:47:12 Yeah.
01:47:13 I never played that one.
01:47:14 I rented Legend of Mana one time and I played it a little bit and I didn't really get into
01:47:18 it and I had Sword of Mana on the Game Boy Advance which I think is sort of a remake
01:47:24 of like Seikenden Setsu one.
01:47:28 Yeah.
01:47:29 It's a remake of that which was released here as Final Fantasy Adventure on the Game Boy.
01:47:34 Right.
01:47:35 Right.
01:47:36 Yeah.
01:47:37 I mean it's a big remake.
01:47:39 They changed a lot.
01:47:40 Yeah.
01:47:41 It's pretty different.
01:47:42 Yeah.
01:47:43 Hmm.
01:47:44 Um.
01:47:45 Video games.
01:47:46 I love them.
01:47:47 I have to pee.
01:47:48 I will be back in a second.
01:47:49 Go right ahead.
01:47:50 Well you know Legend of Mana is pretty interesting because it plays like Secret of Mana but I
01:48:06 think the gimmick is that every time you beat an area or a quest you can place a building
01:48:14 on the map and you can choose where you place the building and depending on how you place
01:48:20 the buildings it affects certain elements in the game.
01:48:25 The Mana series always seemed really interesting to me but I only I've only played Secret of
01:48:32 Mana for a little bit and Secret of Mana is I mean it's a it's a it's a game.
01:48:42 But I also remember watching your Children of Mana review.
01:48:47 Yes.
01:48:48 I have very extensive knowledge of Children of Mana which is probably not the best first
01:48:55 impression to the series.
01:48:58 Yeah I um I played that a little bit when it first came out and then I think in the
01:49:02 last few years I went back and I beat it you know it revisited and it's a it's okay but
01:49:09 it's kind of repetitive I think.
01:49:11 Yeah.
01:49:12 The the gameplay is really it really wears itself out very shortly.
01:49:18 I don't know there is something sort of captivating about it or at least there was when I was
01:49:22 a kid and it looks really pretty but um uh I it was one of those games I beat because
01:49:29 they had not because I really liked it and it's a it kind of is pretty fun for the first
01:49:36 dungeon or two but then after that it becomes way too samey.
01:49:41 Especially since they expect you to do like side quests where it just go through those
01:49:44 levels again.
01:49:45 Yeah.
01:49:46 Which is like uh I'd rather rather rather rather rather rather.
01:49:49 It does kind of feel a little bit like one of those uh I guess quick cash-ins because
01:49:55 is like they worked hard on the assets and building the core of the game but then the
01:49:58 rest of it is just uh copy and pasted side quests.
01:50:03 Yeah and the story isn't really anything to write home about either.
01:50:10 But uh in my opinion one of the best mana games I think is Seikend Incense 2 3 which
01:50:15 hmm try to localize right as trials of mana here.
01:50:21 That was another one of those games that it kind of like Live Alive was one of those like
01:50:26 never ever games which is amazing that it got localized.
01:50:30 Yeah I uh I beat that game in 2014 uh because it got a fan translation I think around that
01:50:37 time maybe a few years earlier.
01:50:39 We hadn't before.
01:50:40 No actually I had an old fan translation from the early 2000s.
01:50:44 Oh that was like a shitty one though.
01:50:46 And I just didn't get around to beating it up to 2014.
01:50:50 Oh alright alright.
01:50:52 And I published a review on it uh on my website back then you know that's the only reason
01:50:58 I remember I beat it in 2014 because the review was written uh you know so that one is really
01:51:05 good.
01:51:06 I was very impressed by it.
01:51:07 It's something I want I want to try.
01:51:09 I bought that mana collection a couple of years ago and I played a little bit of Trials
01:51:16 or Seikend Incense 2 3.
01:51:18 I was playing with my uh with my brother though and you know to co-op in a game like that
01:51:24 you kind of have to like align schedules and then it's like uh if I want to play and he
01:51:29 doesn't want to play kind of shit out of luck so it just kind of never really got off the
01:51:32 ground.
01:51:33 Yeah that's right.
01:51:34 I played it.
01:51:35 Oh welcome back.
01:51:36 Yes.
01:51:38 That's the issue with these games is that uh if you can line up your schedule so that
01:51:42 you can play with a friend or two every time it's probably going to be like one of the
01:51:47 greatest experiences but if you can't do that you know most people can't do that uh then
01:51:53 it's not going to be as good but it's still pretty fun as a single player.
01:51:57 What are we talking about now?
01:51:59 You know uh Trials of Mana Seikend Incense 2 3.
01:52:05 It was uh it was a Mana game that came out on the Super Nintendo but never came out over
01:52:09 here uh until like a couple of years ago when Square like dug up the ROM and localized
01:52:15 it and remade it.
01:52:16 Yeah I'm not sure why Square did that but uh pretty nice of them.
01:52:21 Uh yeah it was surprisingly uh surprisingly out of character yeah charitable cause like
01:52:29 you know they were remaking the game so they really had no reason to bother localizing
01:52:36 the original.
01:52:37 I see.
01:52:38 Uh but they did so uh cool now we have two versions of the game awesome.
01:52:44 Okay all right all right.
01:52:46 Yeah and I uh I beat that one in 2014 and also published a review for it back then.
01:52:52 Yeah this is really it's a really pretty game too.
01:52:57 Hang on wait uh Trials of Mana yeah Trials of Mana there there's uh the the Super Nintendo
01:53:04 version the the 3D remake they made uh I think I heard it was pretty good but it's definitely
01:53:10 kind of low rent compared to like your Final Fantasy 7 remakes.
01:53:14 Yeah.
01:53:15 But that's okay.
01:53:16 This not not everything needs to be like a huge dick.
01:53:20 Well I prefer the original artwork I think the original art is uh fantastic.
01:53:26 Yeah because at the time this was like the big dick triple A uh experience because this
01:53:33 is like some of the best looking like sprite art on Super Nintendo yeah it's a square game
01:53:39 so.
01:53:40 And the music's pretty nice too.
01:53:42 Yeah I should give this a try.
01:53:45 Why did is this the one where you turn into a werewolf?
01:53:49 I think that's one of the characters yeah one of the characters is named Kevin and he
01:53:53 turns into a werewolf at night and he gets pretty strong.
01:53:57 Oh yeah what man I think wait yeah you made it did you make a video about this chrono
01:54:03 this this game uh no I just uh wrote a text review of it.
01:54:07 Okay because I yeah I've seen this and like yeah the sprites look so good why would you
01:54:12 not bring this that it was so good it's such a good looking SNES game what a waste.
01:54:20 It was in the middle of that like time uh where RPGs still hadn't completely uh captured
01:54:28 the west yeah or at least so they so square assumed I I think they did at least by the
01:54:36 by the Super Nintendo I think the RPGs were doing all right for themselves uh because
01:54:43 I know I know I was playing like Final Fantasy IV and stuff or at least my brother was.
01:54:48 Okay they uh they claimed that RPGs weren't popular in the west but they didn't release
01:54:53 a lot of them here until later.
01:54:56 Yeah and like you know mana is like it's kind of like an action RPG but you know it's not
01:55:02 like Zelda and there's scary numbers in it so I assume we wouldn't like it.
01:55:07 Have you uh are you do you know do you know Secret of Evermore yeah I was actually going
01:55:11 to bring that up because that's kind of that I was just I just saw it recommended underneath
01:55:17 in the Google image search I just did and it just I I've never played Secret of Evermore
01:55:23 I just reminded me that like I used to see it on like the blockbuster shelf and I thought
01:55:29 the cover art was scary.
01:55:30 Uh that game is weird because it's um I don't really know anything about it just I remember
01:55:37 seeing it and being intrigued because it's square soft but also being like I'm unsettled
01:55:42 by this creature uh correct me if I'm wrong chrono but I'm pretty sure this was made by
01:55:50 a western studio.
01:55:52 Yeah it was made by I think a square of America at the time.
01:55:56 It was American division.
01:56:00 It was sort of like the it has like a contemporary setting sort of uh or you like time traveling
01:56:07 stuff the the whole point of the game was that like we need something that American kids
01:56:11 will like and that's yeah basically the the hook of the game.
01:56:15 And actually a lot of people in the early 2000s anyway uh hated this game because they
01:56:20 thought uh you know it wasn't made by the original Japanese square developers so it
01:56:25 sucks but uh I don't I don't think it's that bad it's actually pretty alright.
01:56:32 Seeing seeing the the cover art with this like blonde kid with what is he holding like
01:56:35 a bone yeah like like for his dog a wrench or something yeah his first weapon is a bone
01:56:42 that uh uses it's actually in that cover it's awesome actually I like this really captivating.
01:56:49 Seeing that reminds me of uh of um Star Star tropics uh which was like they made they made
01:56:57 that to be another like oh let's make a game that appeals to Americans yeah so we'll we'll
01:57:02 set it we'll make the kid like an all-american football player and we'll name him like we'll
01:57:06 name him like John Henry or something his name's uh uh Mike Jones the same yeah yeah
01:57:13 Steve Smith is something yeah what is what is the name of the guy in this like the American
01:57:19 version of Secret of Mana yeah I think I saw the name and I think I think I might have
01:57:25 assumed that it was like a sequel or something to Secret of Mana uh those are my two favorite
01:57:32 games on the SNES as a kid Secret of Mana and Mario RPG then you probably like uh Trouser
01:57:38 of Mana because it plays it's like Secret yeah I think I would I think I would have
01:57:43 loved Secret of Mana I can't I can't believe they didn't let me play it yeah it's it's
01:57:51 frustrating there's a lot of cool games we didn't get ever I think like Front Mission
01:57:55 Gun has it the real reason probably didn't bring it over is because it had a large script
01:58:01 so it would have been really costly to translate and this was uh in 95 so uh it was towards
01:58:07 the end of the Super Nintendo's lifespan yeah I'm sorry how much how much could how much
01:58:13 could it cost how much could it cost to translate all the text in a SNES game well well believe
01:58:18 it or not back then uh it was pretty difficult to translate text and games because uh I think
01:58:25 the the western developers they didn't have the same two owns that uh the Japanese developers
01:58:30 had to change the text it was kind of uh from a coding standpoint it was complicated yeah
01:58:36 you couldn't just like you know find and replace Japanese text and paste in English script right
01:58:42 like Tim Rogers talks about that in that Final Fantasy 7 video yeah they sometimes would have to
01:58:46 hack the game's code in order to make it work with uh different font sizes and stuff he I've seen
01:58:52 I've seen Let's Mosey yeah I know he talks about like having to I don't know he talks about like
01:58:58 having to do it through on like a spreadsheet he doesn't really talk about like the the technical
01:59:03 aspects of it I guess it makes sense that you might have to do coding at some point you might
01:59:10 have to actually go in and like fuck with it to make it display properly and and and etc I think
01:59:15 also a Japanese text is more condensed than um English so whenever you translate anything the
01:59:22 lines are longer and then they don't fit and then you have to figure out a way to make them fit
01:59:26 which sometimes requires hacking the game's code yeah you need extra text boxes probably
01:59:33 uh and so I mean I get I get that yeah back then like uh you can even see it on The Secret of
01:59:40 Evermore uh case here they're like they don't say anything about the game they just call it a 24 meg
01:59:46 action adventure just to say like oh it's it's the file size is big that means the game's good
01:59:52 like uh Secret of the Trials of Mana was probably like a really big game like a couple megabytes at
02:00:00 least and you know like the more yeah it's it's like nothing now it's fucking don't even
02:00:06 no please the thought four megabytes Jesus Christ that's like million that's millions of
02:00:15 but like back then like the more the bigger your game was the the more it cost to make the cart
02:00:22 so I assume they just saw like how huge that's actually that was and like that's one of the
02:00:28 reasons why Japanese RPGs on the Super Nintendo are so expensive to buy now because they didn't
02:00:34 manufacture many copies of them back then as as it was so expensive to make those cartridges
02:00:39 they're pricier back then too yeah they were costly sometimes you would have to spend like
02:00:44 80 or 90 dollars just to buy brand new I mean Nintendo game back then did well I mean um am I
02:00:52 wrong do do all the uh SNES cartridges not all have the same chips in them uh some it depends
02:00:59 there's a lot of uh Super Nintendo games now they have different chips some of them they have a
02:01:04 specialized uh hardware chips like the Super FX chip which is it's like basically a graphics card
02:01:11 or a GPU built into the cartridge that would enhance the Super Nintendo's uh graphical capabilities
02:01:18 when attached yeah it's it's how you got stuff like star fox yeah that's how the Super Nintendo
02:01:24 could do 3d polygons with star fox and then there's also uh you know the memory like uh
02:01:30 this secret ever evermore was on a 24 meg cartridge when they say they mean megabit not
02:01:37 megabyte by the way oh okay okay so three three megabyte game right here big deal
02:01:44 yeah did um I mean we're like we're rpgs like more data intensive than other than like platformers
02:01:52 yeah because they were bigger yeah worlds with more graphics to store and stuff I think um
02:01:58 they could have just made a bigger platformer then and lazy it would have been nice I think the biggest
02:02:04 Super Nintendo game is either Tales of Fantasia or Star Ocean it's one of those because uh because
02:02:12 those games straight up have voice acting in them I never played either of those and uh I probably
02:02:19 would have been stoked too but yeah yeah I think how do you put how do you put voice acting on a
02:02:24 SNES cartridge all right well let me tell you why would you do that just the flex seems insane
02:02:31 seems completely insane I think it really is Star Ocean had a special compression uh technology
02:02:37 that allowed it to store more data into Super Nintendo cartridge it's called sd something
02:02:44 yeah it's it's it's a add-on chip I think and uh a lot of like flashcards or whatever couldn't
02:02:52 replicate it for years yeah but I remember reading about either Tales of Fantasia or Star Ocean in
02:03:00 Nintendo Power in the late 90s and um back then they kind of made it seem like those games were
02:03:07 going to get released in the US eventually and then they didn't so I was um I was watching
02:03:15 which I was watching some Kim Justice video about it was about RPGs in Europe but specifically
02:03:22 about like a magazine there was like a particular European magazine that covered JRPGs and that like
02:03:30 that sounds cool oh yeah let me try and find that video because it was pretty it was pretty good
02:03:36 I think the magazine I read this stuff in was like game players or something and they changed
02:03:43 their name later in the 90s to get to what uh they renamed themselves but there were a lot of
02:03:50 really cool uh gaming magazines back then oh here we go here I found the exact video uh
02:04:01 Kim Justice the story of JRPGs in the UK before Final Fantasy 7 Super Play magazine that is such
02:04:10 like a niche topic yeah that's that's Kim. The UK had really bad luck even worse than the US when he
02:04:16 came to RPGs because the the history the history of uh of uh of platformers on this on the ZX Spectrum
02:04:28 I've only seen one Kim Justice video and it was I'm sorry to make fun of her voice
02:04:33 it's just very funny but I like her videos a lot actually I like this great I like the one I saw it
02:04:38 was on um Oasis's Be Here Now album so I thought she was I thought she was a music channel no I
02:04:45 haven't seen that one but I'm curious because I've only heard her talk about video games
02:04:51 I found her through her Peter Molyneux uh like like basically like the biography of Peter Molyneux
02:04:57 which is I actually just rewatched that the other day it's good yeah uh yeah I'll have to I'll have
02:05:04 to check this out yeah I think um I think the UK didn't even get Final Fantasy 6 or Chrono Trigger
02:05:10 uh they did yeah they got some sort I think they were not officially released but I think
02:05:15 there were there were like uh underground there were like indie venues that could potentially
02:05:21 provide you with with with hacks of some some games uh uh they uh there was a scene I think they
02:05:30 didn't get Chrono Trigger but uh they did get uh TerraNigma which is kind of that's uh that was
02:05:36 unusual is a US didn't get that one yeah yeah I I really want to play that one I still haven't
02:05:43 played it yeah I beat that one a couple years back and I also reviewed it it's uh quite good
02:05:50 uh I've managed to remain unspoiled uh about the game I hear the story is really good so I'm
02:05:57 uh curious to play it someday yeah it's um it's similar to Illusion of Gaia it's yeah it's made
02:06:04 by the Act Razor and Illusion of Gaia Dev's Quintet okay uh oh yeah Act Razor is fucking awesome
02:06:12 it's really good Act Razor is the one where you play as like the angel like you're recreating
02:06:16 society or civilization yeah I've I like only learned about these games through like um uh
02:06:23 speed uh uh what's the the speed convention there's speed running game game yeah games
02:06:31 don't quit okay I've seen people play them as games don't quit I'd never seen any of these before
02:06:36 yeah I really like uh I really like Soul Blazer by Quintet I think that that's like a really uh
02:06:44 competent action RPG from like the early SNES and I uh Illusion of Gaia I don't like as much
02:06:53 honestly yeah though it's it's a prettier game it feels a little less uh good to play I don't know
02:07:00 something about it but I still haven't beaten it which is why I haven't played Terranigma yet
02:07:06 well most people prefer uh most people prefer Illusion of Gaia to Soul Blazer but um I like
02:07:11 both of them both uh pretty good I don't know something about Soul Blazer I like how simple it
02:07:17 I guess it is compared to Gaia actually Soul Blazer has a gimmick in it that's pretty similar to
02:07:23 something from Dark Cloud yes it is similar I I do like Dark Cloud a lot so that might be why I
02:07:29 like it more it's like in Soul Blazer you you start out with an empty uh town that there's like
02:07:35 nobody there and then you explore dungeons and as you kill monsters in dungeons the town gets
02:07:42 repopulated yeah and buildings appear in the town as well and by the end of the game the town is
02:07:50 huge and bustling so Dark Cloud had almost the same thing uh for some reason I don't know if the
02:07:56 two games are related Dark Cloud's also kind of similar to Actraiser too I would you know because
02:08:02 you can build stuff as well now something about uh I really I'm really fascinated with Quinta
02:08:10 as a developer because they made really weird games back then when a lot of people like were
02:08:15 still figuring out like even like how a platformer works well these guys were making like sim action
02:08:23 hybrid games and they just kind of dropped off the face of the earth after the 90s I always
02:08:29 wanted to make a video like kind of like dissecting whatever happened to them but I don't really feel
02:08:34 like I have the resources necessary to do that well I highly recommend uh you try Tere Nigma
02:08:41 because it gets really interesting towards the end you know it's a very uh it seems like a
02:08:46 really fascinating game I have this is a really funny story I bought a cart a Tere Nigma cart
02:08:53 uh a PAL version of it and I have like a I have a super NT so I can just play a PAL cartridges
02:09:00 just fine I thought it was the English translation but it's the German I have a German cart of
02:09:07 Tere Nigma so I turned the game on I'm like oh I haven't but that's fine you just have to
02:09:16 learn German no big deal uh yeah but my my German is completely ruined is over I have
02:09:25 not taken German since high school uh yeah man those guys were cool
02:09:34 well you know what they say um 2d beats 3d any day of the week I was 2d 3d pd I was uh
02:09:49 I was just looking at I I was gonna complain because I thought uh I started at Mega Man
02:09:56 04 and I saw some of the in-game graphic or some of the in-game cutscene images and I thought
02:10:02 okay they don't this is not Toru Nakayama this is not drawn by Toru Nakayama they don't have
02:10:08 the guy they lost the guy no but I'm looking at this article and I guess that's not true like
02:10:16 Toru was still working on it he still drew like promo images and stuff for uh uh uh ZX and stuff
02:10:25 but some of the some of the art in that some of the art is definitely not from his pen maybe he was
02:10:31 like more of a backseat for this one more of a backseat more of a concept art he didn't do all of
02:10:35 the in-game cutscenes probably got some some schlubs to do some of it Ben they were they were
02:10:41 so caught off guard about the fan demand for a new Mega Man 0 they couldn't they were like oh we
02:10:47 didn't tell Toru that he was gonna have to make a game that actually finished the story like we
02:10:52 were just we didn't think it's really unexpected uh we didn't we didn't renew his contract oh god
02:10:59 now we gotta give him benefits for another year of this bullshit oh we can't afford him
02:11:05 let's just get an intern to like kind of trace just kind of copy his character designs for some of
02:11:10 these uh for some of these uh in-game for some of these cutscenes uh you'll never notice
02:11:15 um you know what i did yesterday you want to know this is not video games sorry i'm sorry
02:11:30 i went sailing yesterday oh if you can believe it yeah i went on well i wasn't really sailing
02:11:36 because there wasn't very much wind there was occasionally wind mostly the motor was on for
02:11:41 a lot of it but i went on a boat my uh my dad and my brother went uh deep sea fishing yesterday
02:11:48 so they were also on a boat deep sea fishing yeah they didn't catch much kind of a bust
02:11:55 like of a trip how deep how deep are we talking uh they just go like a i guess a couple miles out
02:12:01 from the from the coast to i'm like i'm like some schooner or something i don't know do they uh
02:12:07 do they dive into the ocean and use spears or harpoons to catch their prey
02:12:13 we got to go down in the mariana trench and find like get the like you know in um in uh uh
02:12:19 in the harvest not harvest moon something valley stardew valley in stardew valley you
02:12:26 catch the deep sea fish when you go down in the in the submarine or whatever and you catch like the
02:12:31 weird uh lantern fish and stuff you gotta go you gotta go way down for the really deep fish
02:12:37 that's what you want see i always know trade them for more for more for more money i always knew
02:12:42 i was doing something wrong when i go fishing i don't have a submarine that's what i need
02:12:48 a submarine yeah exactly you cut yeah uh uh yeah i don't know i just i went on a boat that's all
02:12:57 i'm sorry that's all i have to say i was on a boat how how would you get the boat uh my my dad
02:13:04 and his friend co-own a small sailboat together and they love it it's like it's like my dad's
02:13:09 a hobby basically that's cool him and his him and his buddy sail this boat it's their thing
02:13:15 and i haven't been like christopher cross or something christopher cross yeah sailing
02:13:22 yeah forget it never mind i'm not i'm not familiar someone someone in the comments maybe
02:13:28 we'll get it forget it doesn't matter the uh i hope you had fun on the boat i had not been on the
02:13:34 boat for i've got to be like 10 years now the last time i went to this i didn't go on the boat i
02:13:41 didn't get on it but the last time i saw the boat actually it was a different boat because they
02:13:45 they traded they like sold a different boat and they bought a replacement uh but uh the last
02:13:51 time i saw the boat was like probably five or six years ago and it was to film nate's footage
02:13:59 for a best anime ever one piece oh that that'll chest not great video by the way it was to record
02:14:07 i i stood on the dock in a recorded footage of nate on the boat and uh still waiting for that video
02:14:16 uh that's a pretty good use of uh of a boat if i ever saw one right that's production value
02:14:23 that's production value right there um yeah it's like a it's like a jon tron video
02:14:30 oh yeah it's exactly like that me uh me and uh michael from reps to go where we're sitting on
02:14:40 footage of of something we recorded like a year ago now for basically use whenever we feel like
02:14:48 using it i guess so it's maybe not exactly the same as you want to give a hint uh no i i think
02:14:56 i've already said too much all right it's just it's something we uh we met up at like last year
02:15:02 we did some recording fair enough just as like uh well we're together we might as well do something
02:15:09 for the channel i guess you know i yeah good point you know you know i binged reps to gog uh a while
02:15:16 ago oh yeah i watched the whole catalog yeah excellent quite and it's quite enjoyable yeah
02:15:23 i'm uh i'm hoping i think i think michael's just about the finish uh the kingdom hearts review
02:15:30 that's been a millstone around his neck for a while now god that's like a game that i've heard of
02:15:36 yeah it's i don't come to reps to gog for games that i've heard of uh me neither sometimes
02:15:44 did the whole thing where you're trying to review every ps2 game ever yeah you review every ps2 game
02:15:51 oh god it's a quite a massive undertaking it is how many games are is that i think there's a couple
02:15:59 thousand okay and how many videos have you made like 20 hey gotta start somewhere yeah yeah the ps2
02:16:08 has like more games and almost any console and a lot of the games are really long if you that's uh
02:16:14 that's kind of why we we did it because yeah isn't it the funniest game to funniest console to review
02:16:20 every game for the the the the sort of uh what do you call it sort of the unofficial uh the unofficial
02:16:27 mascot of it is sisyphus pushing yes yes yeah that that was it was a very inspired choice there
02:16:36 in my in the time uh i think last time i was on here i was saying i was gonna do an enter the
02:16:42 matrix reps to god which came out i saw yeah yeah i was gonna say you did that one and uh i recently
02:16:48 finished the digital devil saga 2 1 and i've been focusing on doing a uh a channel or a video
02:16:57 for my main channel it's kind of a big video so it's kind of just like very slowly chipping along
02:17:04 at that just kind of like it it's one of those things where as i'm making it i'm like oh my god
02:17:11 can i like actually do this or should i just like i'm still in like the i can still give up but i
02:17:17 really don't want to i want to i want to get it done and that feeling yeah that's how i thought
02:17:23 when i was doing the mario rpg video yeah it's uh it's a it's a commentary video i think that's
02:17:34 the most i want to say about it like you know like the mathematosis commentary videos yeah those are
02:17:41 like bar none my favorite videos on youtube and i like i love watching those and i always wanted
02:17:48 a commentary video for game i'm making one on right now and since no one else is gonna do it
02:17:54 i will that's basically it that rules i'll watch it yeah unless it's a game unless it's a game that
02:18:00 i really hate now you'll probably it's a pretty likable game the only problem i'm having right
02:18:06 now is that like i'm worried that there's kind of been a bit of like a kickback or a pushback
02:18:13 against like the whole like big video craze that's kind of been taken over youtube the past couple
02:18:19 of years you think so uh i i you know i see it every now and then you know the only the only
02:18:25 reason people push back against it is because they're popular and people like them i i think so too i
02:18:31 i think so they get haters i think it's you know there's like some uh fair criticism there where
02:18:38 it's just like oh it's a long video you're just you're repeating yourself you're it's just uh
02:18:44 it you're just uh synopsizing what's what happens in the game or the show it really yeah there's
02:18:50 some it really depends sometimes they can they they feel padded because they're repetitive and
02:18:56 sometimes it's just synopsis and those are two pitfalls that those kind of videos can fall into
02:19:01 they don't they're not all like that yeah it's some some of them are for sure it's something
02:19:06 i'm really trying to avoid when making my video uh it's pretty difficult to write a script at the
02:19:13 same time it is for so many hours yeah i do think i do think that a video if a video is long enough
02:19:21 it's okay for there to be a certain amount of repetition because it's certain certain concepts
02:19:28 will bear repeating like when they become relevant in multiple different like times in the narration
02:19:35 i don't so i i don't i don't i don't think repetition is is like is it is it is a mortal sin
02:19:42 but some of yeah some some it's a it's a pitfall it's okay it's something i can see the criticism on
02:19:49 but i also kind of it also sort of feels like you know these like big videos that people make on
02:19:57 youtube are something that you could only see online or like on youtube like uh you're never
02:20:04 gonna watch you're never gonna see someone talk about x thing for uh for like like four hours on
02:20:11 like on like an actual produced television show just no you know it's sort of embracing like you're
02:20:17 never gonna see uh uh somebody like cyber shall talk about uh the chow garden for like one or two
02:20:23 hours in a video exactly exactly and that's something i think people should uh should embrace a little
02:20:31 more when dunking on quentin reviews for his really long boring i carly videos or whatever i
02:20:38 i think that i think that all the criticism of those videos is completely warranted and yet
02:20:44 i like them yeah well you know sometimes like i just watched like a fucking six hour video about
02:20:50 lost which is basically the bill the billiam one yes i'm halfway through the the new billiam lost
02:20:56 video it's this is my this is my genre i will defend the long video yeah format i think it's great
02:21:04 i like that video a lot because it wasn't i mean it was sort of he was just sort of talking about
02:21:08 the plot of the show and he did himself a bit a lot of that is synopsis something i did like about
02:21:14 it is he also manages to talk about the pop culture about lost at the time which is something that
02:21:20 people who binge watch it like what i did uh won't really know seeing that like hey they literally
02:21:26 made magazines about what happens on this one show it's so weird or like all like the press
02:21:34 junkets where it's just like uh so who's the hunkiest on the island i get i i mean i get that
02:21:41 they're i get that a little bit just the just the sheer scale of it though yeah yeah it was huge
02:21:48 and is is hillary hillary clinton like name dropping it so so funny yeah it uh in an alternate
02:21:59 timeline that would have been the the pokemon go to the polls kind of yeah i think so form a community
02:22:05 to to find out what's what the heck is going on in loss i don't know it in the the pop culture
02:22:11 sections almost sort of justify the length of um yeah of the video because it's sort of it's
02:22:19 inadvertently tells you that lost was this juggernaut that never that like had had so much of a
02:22:27 following that uh yeah someone will watch a six hour video talking about it it it's interesting
02:22:34 i like i like that video quite a bit yeah it's nice to have that uh cultural context
02:22:41 because that's not something you're gonna get to be watch it now yeah reminds i mean um the other
02:22:47 one that jumps to mind is the jenny nicholson uh vampire diaries video which kind of goes into
02:22:53 huh i haven't seen that one it's good i know about it and it it it does it does just it does
02:23:01 describe the plot of the show it does summarize the show but it also talks kind of about like
02:23:07 production production uh uh things like what was going on with like the studio and the cast
02:23:14 and crew and the deal with uh like the original author and the rights to the franchise and and
02:23:19 all that stuff it's great yeah um but you always have to uh give like a promise of whatever it is
02:23:28 you're talking about you have to always at least describe some of the plot yeah yeah there especially
02:23:35 for our television show uh i'm just hoping to get this video done because i would i would like it to
02:23:42 be like a big i haven't i haven't made a video since or on the main channel since october so
02:23:48 i feel i feel like i kind of have to be like here's here's my grand return or whatever i would like
02:23:54 i would like for it to be a nice statement you you and me are in kind of the same boat then
02:23:59 because i have not put out a video in a long time well you're not primarily a video guy you
02:24:05 you're still not really along with the comic i have yeah i have done some other stuff in the
02:24:09 meantime but still you know this is kind of my yeah it's kind of like my return to youtube like hey
02:24:14 guys i finally sorry i haven't made a video in a while yeah and and mine is also going to be
02:24:19 it's gonna be pretty large i think is the plan so so i hope i hope the video goes well yes and
02:24:30 you're not gonna tell me what it's about yeah uh maybe after the podcast i guess okay when do you
02:24:37 i mean do you have a do you have a time frame in mind uh i i basically like i want it
02:24:46 as soon as it's uh as soon as i finish the script like the script i'm uh i'd say i'm like a little
02:24:53 under a third done and uh you know obviously i prefer you and stuff but uh since it's a commentary
02:25:02 video uh that the video editing part of it uh goes by significantly faster than um a regular video
02:25:10 would all right just because you're just kind of talking over your gameplay footage right yes yes
02:25:15 yeah yeah this video is gonna be uh scripted it is yes aren't you tectonic improv yeah ha ha
02:25:25 very funny you know you know funnily enough you know you know actually i am a little surprised
02:25:31 that like you'd fully script out like a commentary um because okay i've done i've done a few commentary
02:25:39 videos before i did a cave story one and uh a one on super mario land and uh when i made my cave
02:25:47 story video i think i made i was making videos like a year at that point and um basically i was trying
02:25:54 i was basically like looking over at matthew matosa's homework and being just like okay well
02:25:59 how does he do it and then just basically trying to copy him and i'm pretty sure that his demon
02:26:04 souls and dark souls commentaries are not scripted yeah which it like you can tell because of how
02:26:10 natural he sounds when he talks but like that is amazing to me is amazing that that man you know
02:26:17 through like several takes obviously but like he was able to talk and talk and he just has he just
02:26:23 has that much to say yeah it's really amazing and i tried to do something similar when i made
02:26:31 my cave story commentary and i think i got five minutes into into the initial recording and
02:26:37 just kind of like i stopped it and i was like this isn't gonna work and i i had i had the scripted out
02:26:44 well you could okay i mean were you planning to like commentate over like the full unedited
02:26:51 playthrough no no uh the for how big the game is it's definitely there's definitely going to be
02:26:58 cuts like a lot of cuts but yeah the the idea is still i still want the idea to sort of be like
02:27:06 this is a a playthrough of the game you were getting you were getting like the game and not
02:27:12 yeah this this is a substitute for the original product this is not fair use yes yeah yeah i i
02:27:19 intend to be uh taken down by nintendo yes for this for this video but like uh i'm looking at the the
02:27:30 on just like the raw footage right now and it's like well over 10 hours and like fuck that i mean
02:27:36 couldn't couldn't get me to write write something like that for 10 hours and make it interesting
02:27:41 oh so the video so the game is one that's over 10 hours uh putting that down in my
02:27:47 on my little on my little checklist yeah just cross-reference how long to beat.com
02:27:53 every game that can be beaten under 10 hours but yeah it's uh it's a it's a game it's a video game
02:28:03 it's honestly cool i can't imagine writing a script for anything that's several hours long
02:28:09 you know that's uh must be real hard and um you know you know i i mean i was thinking about it
02:28:16 it's actually i was surprised to realize that like an hour narration is only like 1500 words no no
02:28:23 10 minutes sorry 10 minutes is 1500 words right or or uh something around that it depends on how
02:28:30 fast you talk obviously so an hour long video then is only maybe like like it's like 9 000 words
02:28:37 which i mean is it's a lot to write but uh i feel like on a if you're really feeling it and you
02:28:45 really have a lot to say i feel like i could write 9 000 words in a day yeah uh like well my
02:28:52 cave story commentary was uh it was like a little under two hours i think yeah and it's 19 000 words
02:29:03 yeah yeah that's like well that sounds about right novel it's well below novel length
02:29:08 mm-hmm and i guess uh i just find it really hard because all my stuff usually is uh jokes one
02:29:15 after the other yes so it's not easy to write uh like one hour worth of jokes of course well it
02:29:23 helps that i don't try to i don't try to be funny in my videos most of the time it's it's i think it's
02:29:29 easier to write uh more or at least for me i i find it easier to write more dry analytically than uh
02:29:38 than to really have like a lot of uh humor or whatever put in because i mean you know i gotta
02:29:45 think of a joke and like you know think of joke takes a lot of time gotta be clever my the video
02:29:52 that i of that will not be named is it's it's not scripted it's not like scripted scripted i have
02:29:59 notes i have many bullet points and i have any anytime i for a few for maybe a month or two now
02:30:06 i have been every anytime i think of something funny that is relevant to the subject at hand
02:30:11 i open up a little i have a little notepad and i just have like a list of jokes and i'm like okay
02:30:17 i'll just i thought of a funny a funny joke i'll just write that or a funny thing to reference
02:30:22 i'll put that in there in roughly the the period and i'll just when i'm recording i'll just okay
02:30:27 make make sure to make sure to mention that make sure to not forget to actually this is uh this
02:30:31 is how uh larry david does his uh does curb your enthusiasm he mentioned it in an interview
02:30:38 yeah he walks around with a notepad in his pocket all day and every time he comes up with a joke he
02:30:45 uh jots it down and then when he goes home he transports everything into a larger notepad
02:30:51 and then he turns that into an episode huh hmm hmm i'm a genius so this is uh how a lot of
02:31:01 professional comedians do their uh come up with their comedy well i guess maybe that maybe that
02:31:07 tells me that i've i'm not completely fucking it up yet because it's kind of hard just to sit down
02:31:13 and just come up with jokes in that moment yeah no usually you come up with them uh
02:31:20 you know uh while you're going about your day every once in a while i have a little thought
02:31:26 and i'm like oh that's funny i'll write that down and then i've let them i've let them build up
02:31:30 for that's actually how i i do my videos as well i have a giant uh joke uh text file on my computer
02:31:38 with like hundreds of funds and it's almost the rosetta stone it's almost like it's almost like
02:31:48 creativity is like a is like an ongoing process damn it's all it's almost like yeah
02:31:56 hmm this is just learning learning so much about about life and about the artistic method
02:32:02 this is just this is like old pcp when we talked about uh being content creators remember that
02:32:08 remember that they're really really old pcp yeah the the early days pcphq guys any day now
02:32:19 yeah we just have to move everybody to the same location yeah everyone was at virginia beach
02:32:26 we're waiting for you chrono give it it changed every like five months ever here uh
02:32:33 you ever hear asperger's digi bro rap no no i haven't but it sounds uh sounds amazing
02:32:41 it's um did you record it before or after uh the the beatings alleged beatings i should
02:32:50 tell you let the alleged beatings give me a break there's no evidence there's no evidence on the
02:32:55 books i don't i don't i don't want i don't want to slander the man yeah uh uh uh he's a good boy
02:33:02 good boy you did nothing wrong uh the uh some might say there's no there's no this i'm i'm not
02:33:10 trying not to get too serious but there is no there is no credible there are no credible yes
02:33:14 yes yes um but anyway but anyway um in the in the digi bro rap i don't remember the whole thing
02:33:20 off the top of my head but i do remember there's some bars in there about pcphq and how it's
02:33:26 fucking stupid i guess uh he does have a point he he did have you know what he he you got a
02:33:37 handed to him just like ices you got a handed to him uh what were we talking about before uh
02:33:44 before that um something about uh video game activity is uh i love video games and i love
02:33:50 video games as well i would play them all day well i i actually hate them oh no i'll do you
02:33:58 want better i hate everything so is that yeah that's uh isn't that a youtube channel i saw i saw a
02:34:08 tweet the other day that was asking like what's a creator who's like lost their fame or lost their
02:34:14 their uh their cloud or whatever you know lost their audience yeah and someone said i hate everything
02:34:21 and like i don't i don't think i guess i haven't heard much about him in a while but like he's
02:34:25 got to still be big right yeah he he has um he has that podcast with uh yms and Ralph the
02:34:31 movie maker and then like that other podcast with his friends jar media yeah i was thinking of jar
02:34:38 media what's the one with with yms uh the sardonic cast yes yes yes so like he's still around and i
02:34:46 think he's still i think i think he still has like a uh a a dedicated fan base he maybe but
02:34:54 does he not put out like regular ihe videos much anymore that's a good question i have not
02:35:02 been subscribed i hate everything i just i was surprised to see that because i i never heard of
02:35:07 any like downfall of that guy uh but only one that comes to mind it's not a lot of stupid answers
02:35:14 to that question he doesn't upload a lot yeah he hasn't uploaded since or seven months ago it's the
02:35:20 last time he uploaded so i guess he just focuses more on uh it's not as long as me so yeah yeah
02:35:27 his focus is more on side stuff i think he's still you know he hasn't fallen off in like a in
02:35:35 like a way i would use is that definition is like a big career i feel like i'm like a
02:35:40 and what i was gonna say that was a jauntron way well jauntron still gets views his jauntron
02:35:44 does still get his public perception i think has fallen in in certain crowds his public
02:35:50 perception has fallen and i i mean i just don't think he's funny yeah i haven't in addition to
02:35:55 finding him personally repellent yes well he's i would say like he used to be but for some reason
02:36:01 he still gets a lot of views he does oh great great a under a does that guy even post anymore
02:36:06 i think he does at least somewhat frequently hmm um haven't heard a peep about him in a long
02:36:14 long time that's who that's who i think of when i think of like big creator who's fallen off you
02:36:19 know it's not all like old-ass let's players like to buskis or something oh i mean i think the last
02:36:23 thing i heard about great a under a was like that he had done some covid conspiracy yeah i think he
02:36:29 was like an anti-vaxxer maybe i don't want to sound sounds believable yeah yeah yeah the only the only
02:36:37 one i can think of is uh digipro well of course whatever i got replaced by somebody else whatever
02:36:45 happened to him you know what what where did yeah like what like what is yig studio and who is this
02:36:50 and who is this weirdo and like the the halloween costume i saw i saw people commenting and
02:36:56 here discord about uh i hope giga released like a video talking about like a bunch of
02:37:02 prominent uh anti-tubers and how uh like a history like a history of anti-tube yeah and
02:37:09 i guess trixie is just like kind of footnoted which is pretty sad in the grand actually that's um
02:37:15 that's kind of interesting how uh it trixie isn't mentioned into big anime sphere anymore
02:37:24 you know what it makes sense to me because she was always like never like part of that
02:37:29 she heard her brand was always being like i'm set i'm not like them i'm better than them and
02:37:36 now she and she got what she wanted i guess yeah i i guess yeah uh don't like her no sir
02:37:46 there you go no sir you guys thought you were safe huh you thought you weren't gonna get a
02:37:53 trixie reference well guess what you did it took like two and a half hours is that a trixie reference
02:37:59 is that is that a trixie reference oh bad stop talking about trixie oh my god i can't i can't
02:38:07 i'm too angry my feelings were to her sad sad but true uh uh well hey i was gonna suggest
02:38:23 that we could start a voicemail if you feel like it unless there's anything else you'd rather do
02:38:28 before that uh well actually there's one last thing i want to uh i want to show you okay it's uh
02:38:37 it's not really much to say on it it's just uh this is a really funny song oh fuck yeah there's
02:38:44 an n64 game called buck bumble where you play as a cyborg cyborg bumblebee with guns and stuff
02:38:53 yeah the song kicks ass and the most notable thing about this game is a title screen music
02:39:01 uh buck to the buck oh it's pretty uh pretty interesting i recommend everybody listening
02:39:09 to this to uh check that out i'm cringe i'm cringing i'm cringing i'm bumping my head
02:39:16 yeah that's uh that's kind of the intended effect well i don't know if they intended it but uh
02:39:23 that's the effect it provides i remember uh renting this game as a kid many years ago and i uh i went
02:39:31 back and i beat it recently and the only thing i can remember about it is this song uh i have so
02:39:36 it's not that good i have never heard of it ever uh well it's not it's not horrible but it's kind of
02:39:43 like uh playing it's basic yeah you know there's not much to know about it it's like lover
02:39:51 yeah but uh i completely forgot about this song until i played it again and it's uh
02:39:57 it's it kind of reminds me of like the dk rap from donkey kong 64 it's not as endearing as that but
02:40:05 it's no i would no definitely not but it's still kind of weird and gringy it's hey hey
02:40:15 why why did they make this yeah that that's exactly what i thought
02:40:19 what i was thinking to myself as i listened to this this is like a 3d collectathon like platformer
02:40:24 like an action platformer no it's like an aerial 3d shooter you fly around and you shoot at stuff
02:40:32 hmm i think it's kind of like those uh star wars games uh on n64
02:40:39 you shoot around uh you shoot shield generators to destroy stuff
02:40:45 it's uh basic like search and destroy kind of gameplay you know the game itself sucks but the
02:40:50 song is i think worth listening to well i'm i i now i can never unhear it uh
02:40:58 uh who would you call this like it's like drasta so okay okay i know it's uh i don't know
02:41:06 a jive jamaican guy singing for some reason i don't know why they they thought that was very
02:41:13 european yeah what what's what's them what's thematically yeah it's it's very a year a european
02:41:19 trying to do jamaican drum and bass yeah it's really what what what's thematically relevant
02:41:27 about this song to the game is is my exactly what's what's well what's the motivation here
02:41:32 his name is buck bumble and he bumped to the buck to the bump to the buck buck to the bum
02:41:40 bumble so he like he he bumbles and he bucks his name's buck bumble
02:41:47 yeah that explains everything so it's drum and bass i'm getting there yeah okay it is the 90s
02:41:53 it is the 90s we are in the 90s we are living in the yeek era and uh and buck bumble instead of
02:42:02 yeah instead of uh gushing about like like uh final fantasy and legend of zelda in that game
02:42:06 they should have been like super excited to play buck bumble on the n64 yeah why not you know
02:42:14 with music like this um you know the the sad thing is the rest of the music at the game
02:42:18 isn't like this at all oh lamb the rest of the music is like generic
02:42:25 that was weak would have been nice if the entire soundtrack was like this
02:42:31 it would have it would have at least it would have at least
02:42:34 been something to say about about buck bumble um yeah uh the the speaking of long videos you
02:42:44 know who hasn't made a video in a while uh well i think everybody in this uh in this call
02:42:51 accounts long video long video man hasn't made a video in a while um you might get it i might get
02:43:00 yeah i know you know this person i got thumb through my five billion subscribers
02:43:08 bum to the bum to my bum to my bum yeah i gotta i gotta bum to the buck bumble gotta
02:43:13 gotta buck my bumble real quick well it can't uh it can't be cybershell because he made a dreamcast
02:43:18 video not that long ago i think no it is not cybershell and i did see that dreamcast video
02:43:26 uh and i was uh entertained the sneaker has been uploading recently so i guess it's not him
02:43:34 yeah no uh although i haven't seen his newest uh output i don't normally watch his yakuza videos
02:43:41 because i don't really i'm not in that space i don't play it's fine i don't play them but i
02:43:49 i did binge all of his yakuza videos at one point so i guess somewhere in my mind i'm like
02:43:53 i'll watch another one if he makes more of yakuza videos but i haven't done it yet
02:44:01 uh all right you give up yeah i give up it's tim rogers it's tim rogers actually
02:44:06 yeah doh doi what'd he say he was uh what did cypes i was gonna say cybershell uh cyberpunk set
02:44:14 2077 came out review came out in like october last year hasn't been like a year it's been it's
02:44:19 getting close to a year i i'm yeah well doesn't he take a while to do his videos he does sure
02:44:27 well sure and he also said he was gonna not uh overwork himself on the next one which this might
02:44:36 be why would it take so long it's it's just funny that like the initial the initial action button
02:44:43 uh model was one video a month and uh isn't isn't that cute isn't that what a card
02:44:50 yeah yeah uh i mean he described yeah that's what he says he's gonna do in the final fantasy seven
02:44:55 review uh but then no uh then did he say the next one's earthbound right i think he suggested
02:45:02 the next one would be earthbound for season two i think he said that he would do an earthbound video
02:45:08 but i think the next one i think he says in the cyberpunk video that the next the next next review
02:45:14 is is uh it's some playstation game called like something my summer vacation oh some japanese
02:45:22 yeah yeah uh yeah i don't know what that is i'm looking uh that seems like it could be cool i don't
02:45:29 i've never played the game i'm really interested he said he was going to review final fantasy four
02:45:34 and i'm really i really want to see that one because i love final fantasy four did he say he
02:45:39 was going to do six uh i don't think he said six hmm it's his favorite six would be pretty
02:45:48 interesting i think yeah he wrote he wrote that i mean he i know he wrote that article at one time
02:45:55 about like uh the time about the time he bought final fantasy six i did find that and read that at
02:46:00 some point i should i should read more of his uh his blog or like his website i haven't read that
02:46:08 much of it i wasn't aware uh then he had a website with written articles yeah he does yeah i should
02:46:15 probably him and some other people it's not he didn't write all of the reviews on there but yeah
02:46:21 i should probably check that out as someone who also did that for like you know 20 years
02:46:28 maybe i mean i i can't speak i can't speak to the quality of what's on there
02:46:33 i read i read some of his uh i think it's like his top 100 games of all time and uh you know
02:46:39 i obviously i read some of like the the higher the higher ones i think um i think he puts another
02:46:45 world at number one which is uh another world's a great game and it's nice people talk about it
02:46:53 but i've seen i've seen a lot of i use this phrase lovingly i've seen a lot of highfalutin
02:46:59 critic types uh praising another world it's one of those years it is yeah i've never played it but
02:47:07 in fact i never even knew about it like when i was younger i first heard about it super nintendo
02:47:12 uh like platformer out of this world is what it was called in super nintendo yeah oh yeah it's
02:47:18 is made by the um uh eric chahi the uh part of darkness guy right i i beat that one recently
02:47:25 it's uh pretty interesting it's uh well it famously inspired uh eco that's oh did it you know what
02:47:34 one of its claims to fame and i didn't know that but i it seems obvious now that you say it eco
02:47:39 convinced miyazaki to make games so eco is responsible for dark souls ergo and another world
02:47:46 is responsible for dark souls i didn't know that i i'll i'll it's it's like it's one of those your
02:47:52 favorite game developers favorite games yes yes it's it's also it was also made by one guy so it
02:48:00 has that like sort of auteur feeling to it it's a cool game you can beat it like an afternoon
02:48:05 i think i've seen him i think i've seen a matthew mitosis video about another world
02:48:10 and i've definitely seen a lot of video about heart of darkness i don't know who
02:48:14 matthew did one on heart of darkness i don't maybe that's on another world maybe but he
02:48:20 oh wait he mentions another world when he's talking about abes odyssey yeah that's that's
02:48:25 what i that's what i'm thinking of i did i oh sorry i did a uh i did like a short little video on a
02:48:32 on another world in the g video so you maybe probably also thinking of that i might i might
02:48:39 definitely be thinking of that are we now getting to the point that the new sorry i'm sorry that's
02:48:44 i'm trying to change the topic but you finish your thought before i go on it's it there's a
02:48:48 lot of reviews out there of another world you know yeah i was just gonna ask are we now getting to
02:48:53 the point that uh the wait for the next action button has now been longer than the wait for
02:49:00 cyberpunk 2077 no are we are we pat how long was the wait for a cyberpunk review
02:49:06 oh oh you mean the review i thought you meant the game itself because the game no like 2038
02:49:11 no no no uh oh that's you know it's a good point i think it was only like eight eight months i don't
02:49:16 think it was a whole year yeah token between toky meky memorial and 20 cyberpunk toky meky came out
02:49:21 in january and cyberpunk came out i think in october uh yeah so it's close i can't do the
02:49:30 math right now but uh i think i think oh yeah yeah yeah because it's august so oh yeah so so yeah
02:49:38 it would be to be 10 months i think the yeah i think it's the same i think we're the same yeah
02:49:44 yeah yeah amazing it's uh that's not really that much time in the grand scheme of things uh i mean
02:49:50 after all yeah not really once didn't upload anything for like two years yeah but here's the
02:49:56 thing though i mean when the cyberpunk review came out it was like i mean how many combined
02:50:02 hours is it like 12 hours it's like eight hours i think yeah seven reviews some of which
02:50:09 encompass like an hour and a half some of which are like 20 minutes i had thought
02:50:14 that the next one would not be that size i was under that impression as well and i don't think
02:50:20 it'll be as big as the cyberpunk video but are eight you know he also could be uh he could be
02:50:27 like backlogging them you know so so they uh like he's recording footage for a bunch of different
02:50:34 games uh maybe if we followed his patreon maybe he he's more specific about their reviews yeah
02:50:42 used to do that i know he streams every friday for some reason it doesn't i don't feel like the
02:50:49 weight has been too excruciating for a new tim rogers video i guess because i was i mean i was
02:50:55 surprised to learn to realize how long it has been yeah no i don't disagree because it has been a while
02:51:04 he just thought i i guess i'm just surprised i thought it would be sooner but uh what i mean
02:51:09 you know whatever these things they uh they take time yeah uh i just uh i just and i'm not paid
02:51:16 and i'm not paying any money so i have no i can't complain god damn you yep i'm consuming the content
02:51:23 for free uh all right what do you think about a voicemail now all right let's go all right
02:51:29 let's go there's only like eight or nine i think um was it because they they all got sent to the
02:51:36 incinerator or people just weren't so talkative this week i i assume that uh yeah they stopped
02:51:44 being able to send them because the inbox got full i will i will empty out the old voicemails
02:51:50 from the inbox man what uh you're you're doing the voicemails in like what 2018
02:51:58 is that when you started there's gotta be some old-ass voicemails in there i
02:52:04 i there must be yeah there must be oh no i almost i hate to do it i hate to go back and and delete
02:52:13 well how am i gonna how am i gonna sort through 1.4 gigabytes and and not delete any of the good ones
02:52:20 i can't do it it's impossible it's impossible no i'm gonna i'm gonna have to just select all
02:52:31 delete like half of them yeah well you know they're immortalized in the the the podcast
02:52:38 episodes so you know they exist still you know what here's here's the the silver lining there
02:52:44 back in the day when nate was in charge of it so many of them didn't get listened to and they're
02:52:49 i'm sure there's so many hidden gems in there that will just be right in the trash and i'll never
02:52:55 know and i'll never have to mourn them because i will i'll never experience what i uh i sent a
02:53:01 i sent the voicemail once that uh nate decided wasn't good enough for the podcast i'm pretty sure
02:53:07 do you remember what it was about nate uh used to screen uh the voicemails yeah he did yeah
02:53:13 good good old days remember that he would he would pick out like a handful of them
02:53:17 um back when we back when the pcp cared about quality
02:53:20 hmm right yeah that was a long time ago my voicemail it was uh i forget why it came up but i was
02:53:30 talking about uh i think tom tom tommy oliver for for all the viewers who forget who that is uh
02:53:41 was said on like a podcast that like heart gold and soul silver is just like better in every way
02:53:46 to gold and silver or just like gen two's the best gen and i i basically just i'm actually
02:53:51 in a voicemail which you know fair enough that you don't play that because i think it was kind of
02:53:55 long okay okay uh i don't even remember what i said i think i i think i agree with them i think i
02:54:04 kind of agree with them uh i if if i listened to the specific podcast again i could probably get
02:54:10 the gears rolling again okay uh i won't i won't make you try it out yeah uh your old uh grievance
02:54:20 i think i basically just don't really like the level scaling and joto or the uh well well that's
02:54:26 not really that's not a problem that's a problem with both versions yeah it's something they could
02:54:31 have fixed though uh you know i haven't revisited them in a while but i've heard i've been watching
02:54:36 of some flygon hg hd videos and uh oh he's a he's a nuzlocke guy oh okay flygon hg and um you know
02:54:45 he talks about joto he really dislikes joto i don't dislike it i think specifically the the the
02:54:51 post like the like the specifically for nuzlocking he says like nuzlocking through konto after the
02:54:57 end game of joto he's like a slot he doesn't do it he doesn't include it i could see that joto
02:55:02 runs yeah that's uh that's famously where monkeys uh pokemon crystal nuzlocke ended
02:55:08 got wiped out by i think sabrina oh yes i remember that when i yeah what i'll see in days
02:55:17 the the uh yeah the the run that i played that that brunswick was originally from
02:55:23 i i think it's pretty weak i think i wiped to the uh to the evi girls in in like ho oh tower
02:55:30 whatever right whatever tower but doesn't run so i get killed by a wabba fat yes but he didn't
02:55:36 but i didn't wipe to the wabba fat oh no like like i well like i went on to lose that run
02:55:43 to the fucking evi girls like a chump i doesn't come again with you getting i thought the comic
02:55:50 ends with you getting killed by uh claire and blackthorn yes am i mistaken or is this like
02:55:55 artistic license it does i i changed the yeah i i changed from real life fair enough
02:56:03 no yeah actually that's the good point and i forgot that i did that but yes in real life
02:56:07 i wiped to the evi girls but like i didn't want to draw that this is like uh this is like looking
02:56:12 up the wikipedia the wikipedia article to the biopic and finding out like oh wait a minute rudy
02:56:19 didn't catch the winning touchdown what the fuck they just made that up for the movie no
02:56:27 what do you mean remember the titans isn't real uh the first voicemail is not a voicemail it's an
02:56:35 image i guess so here i'm gonna post the link uh for that um okay so i hear what i'm gathering from
02:56:46 this is that greenhouse gases are just going to go down see i don't know the the guy just posted
02:56:53 the image so i don't know what he's trying or what they are trying oh wait wait there there's a
02:56:56 caption here in parentheses it says they it says they did it so i guess this is i still i
02:57:03 congratulating them on the reduction in greenhouse in us greenhouse gas emissions
02:57:09 i mean well it could also be ironic but i don't really know what i mean i know that this this
02:57:17 act this inflation reduction act just got passed by the house i don't know if that means i think it's
02:57:23 the last good that's senate doesn't it oh and it might just the trajectory down towards the
02:57:29 paris target yeah good just better than nothing i know that uh midgar produces a lot of greenhouse
02:57:37 gas emissions so we need to we need to do something about that city what uh here listen to the the
02:57:44 avalanche conspiracy theorists uh look the lifestream is perfectly renewable energy it's fine
02:57:51 we elected joe mansion because our mako reactors if we close down the mako reactors you know then
02:57:58 what about our jobs what about our jerbs we're gonna lose we're gonna lose all our all our all
02:58:03 industry to nibbleheim uh uh those the those god damn wutai soldiers they're gonna take all
02:58:11 our jobs this communist wutai you know the wood the wood the wutai are manufacturing eco we gotta
02:58:18 stay we gotta stay even with them they're gonna overtake us if we don't uh if we don't keep if
02:58:23 we don't keep sucking up the like sucking up mako we gotta keep we gotta keep the mako make
02:58:27 the mako flowing i stand with president rufus president rufus has said that he president rufus
02:58:37 has said that you know uh we as americans we have to embrace diversity and we have to really formulate
02:58:44 a strategy to form a committee to make an inquiry into the possibility of future greenhouse future
02:58:51 lifestream uh uh ref refinement uh reductions with targets set as as early as 2075 so uh you
02:59:01 know the leaders they they've got to handle don't worry about it it will be renew completely carbon
02:59:08 neutral by year you're never going to see like so like stop complaining we will be lifestream
02:59:13 neutral we will be we will be we will be putting as many uh dead people's souls back into the
02:59:18 lifestream as we are sucking up power but devouring them to create a materia
02:59:25 by the time it happens you'll be part of the lifestream exactly so so they say and that's a relief
02:59:33 and isn't that just a relief and that's a good thing you can you can peacefully go into the
02:59:38 lifestream knowing that you will uh your your contribution will offset will eventually offset
02:59:47 the amount that you used uh in your day-to-day life while you were alive before you yourself are
02:59:53 uh you know harvested to i don't know yeah power some power some fucking tube or gasket or whatever
03:00:00 your soul would be harvested harvested to power some guy's uh private jet to keep to keep uh to
03:00:07 keep to keep janova safely in that tube uh okay the next next voicemail is called uh uh where did

03:01:11 how is samurai not voice grail that's the only reason i'm confused i i said like last episode

03:01:20 i should fix that and then i forgot to fix it so uh no i swear i swear i'll do it you can forget to

03:01:42 is called um question okay three two one go hey new to the show uh wow i'm so sorry gib are you two
03:01:54 dating well hey aben and nate are you two like actually brothers or do you like just call each
03:02:02 other that because you're like black like what's going on there somebody asked that somebody asked
03:02:10 that one time he thought he thought yeah he thought that me and nate were black and that's what we
03:02:14 called each other brothers it might have been a joke it might have been a joke but like how can you
03:02:19 tell that's a good joke if it was a good if it was a joke it was a very funny one um but anyway uh
03:02:26 uh not yet wink not yet wink that's my answer long distance it never works never works but maybe
03:02:34 but it but it might for us but it but it might for us you know they're always just they're always
03:02:39 just diluting themselves you see once once you get work for us once you get php uh pcp a hq
03:02:47 going then it'll be possible then we can get then we can get married for the tax rate you know what
03:02:55 my dad asked me and this sucks i hate this but my dad asked me if i was gonna get married and i said
03:03:01 and i said i don't know and he said and then he pressed the question which i didn't like so i uh
03:03:07 so i responded with uh that i i that i would love to get fake married i would love to get
03:03:12 fake married just for the tax write-off and then my mom was like there's not really a tax write-off
03:03:19 i was like what i guess there's not there's really not that much benefit to it the best
03:03:25 the best benefit the best financial benefit reason is that uh you and you and a spouse together
03:03:32 might uh qualify for like a lower tax bracket but um there's not i thought there was like a
03:03:40 bigger i thought there was like a bigger standard deduction that you get if you're married but no
03:03:46 it it's it's you get double the standard deduction that's because it's two people filing jointly so
03:03:52 like it it's equal so what a fucking ripoff well just uh just remember if you do get married
03:04:00 be sure to livestream uh uh well it's i would say i would say the real the real uh reason
03:04:09 for you and give to get married is so like you could get the the green card right i mean that's
03:04:14 the real that's the real prize not the tax just like just like my conspiracy theory that raw that
03:04:21 the holly and ross's marriage was a green card a green card yes as far as i'm concerned it's it's
03:04:28 true it's it's true to me and that's all that's all i need that the the did i ever explain that i
03:04:36 probably explain i i vaguely remember this uh because ross is canadian right australian australian
03:04:43 okay well you know it's the same thing yeah yeah right my my my my my completely spurious uh uh
03:04:52 claims just based on like uh i don't know just based on that the i think i think holly described
03:04:58 herself as asexual uh before well so i remember i mean i mean i guess i know i know i know asexual
03:05:07 people can have sex and be horny and be sluts and and well i don't even i don't even mean that i
03:05:13 just mean like you know you can marry someone and still like like them love them i i i i i
03:05:20 my claim is not even that they don't like each other in fact you would have to like someone a
03:05:23 lot to uh marry them just to get them a green card i suppose you would yeah it's kind of
03:05:29 a commitment yeah exactly okay yeah sure you know what i don't know truly truly i am speculating
03:05:37 on matters that i have no insight into whatsoever but that's the fun of it you know that's that's
03:05:41 the best kind um next one is oh it's a vocaru link uh from fuck best guy ever dot mp3 at voicemail

03:15:04 what does it what is what without his word you know what is what is a man even worth
03:15:09 wait a minute i don't mean to post that one there's there's 20 something images but some of these are
03:15:15 some of these are repeats some of these are like like zoomed in uh shots of larger pieces this one
03:15:24 i like the clipboard it adds a lot this i this one of uh of uwu poti is uh truly delightful
03:15:37 yeah these are good these are uh this guy's evolving oh yeah oh no tom no tom tom this
03:15:47 is i'm sorry but this is what happens when you this is what happens when you betray the pcp and
03:15:53 you run off to uh hang out with uh richard friends you know you uh you get you get fucked up
03:16:00 uh you get your legs broke uh uh what a shame what is what a shame yeah what a shame but uh you
03:16:08 know don't say it don't say i didn't warn you he was a good man uh for yeah he was you don't
03:16:14 know you don't cross the pcp because then uh that's something you're not gonna walk back from
03:16:20 what is this dragon i think they just he just gave tom a dragon i think i think he just wanted to
03:16:29 draw a dragon uh well this is the the sorceress that was lost i don't know i can't i can't i
03:16:40 can't think of it i was trying to think about tom references oh it's tom tom's jojo stand
03:16:45 spinal tap that's i saw i saw that that's clever that one's pretty good yeah
03:16:53 with each spine gained the user grows stronger and more mobile each spine adding to the arms of
03:17:01 the star and multiplying its strength by tenfold the limitation and release of this power is
03:17:06 is when the user steps on a crack so this has its own lore behind it this guy yeah he's he's
03:17:18 started uh he started doing uh jojo stands as well uh wait i'm just gonna post that i'm
03:17:27 trying to post like the most zoomed out versions of all of these sorry some of the some of the
03:17:31 the ones that i'm posting are repeats and then most of the man most of these are about tom
03:17:39 and that's lame what about me it's the tom arc
03:17:46 tom gets a heart because his spine sure doesn't does that make sense
03:17:50 hello yeah okay
03:17:55 he's uh tom's uh the pcp favorite
03:18:01 not anymore not anymore hey gib want to go with me and have a podcast together to tom i

03:19:26 to do something like that there he is uh i'll have to he did not include a single just big
03:19:34 shot of the whole comic so that's inconvenient i'll have to post this like a pcp fan fiction
03:19:41 yes yeah it's becoming more and more common for some reason more and more of the voicemails are
03:19:49 i think this but this must be inspired by by new the comics about me and gib with the
03:19:54 sounds like a real pcp episode if only um okay uh delightful uh tom is strong and scary and that
03:20:08 is what we've learned today uh the next voicemail is another vocaru uh three two one go my hope is
03:20:16 that that you know that kind of frequent content thing like best ever will be the things people
03:20:21 are really hoping to see for me uh and then like the pcp the potty cast uh and of course
03:20:28 content being like the new place for the faster content the stuff that's about you know timely
03:20:35 releases that me and digi can whip up stuff about um i mean yeah you could probably find a gold
03:20:40 mine of uh of old pcp episodes where yeah things someone said did not exactly pan out as planned
03:20:48 plan oh wait a minute are you telling me are you telling me that these that these plant that
03:20:55 these well-laid plans gong agree what the fuck next you're gonna tell me that the best laid plans
03:21:02 of mice and men often go awry that doesn't know i wouldn't i wouldn't uh uh that's funny to hear
03:21:10 the um uh i mean content was frequent content was frequent when it happened
03:21:21 yeah i guess i don't really remember but yeah it was it was it was frequent ish
03:21:26 i can't it's hard hard to hard to really i would lay the blame on nat not for ending
03:21:33 content but for beginning it uh i would say it was the mistake there uh uh and then uh and then
03:21:42 you know everything else oh oh yeah potty cast dead uh law okay what was the other one he said uh
03:21:53 did he say bestie boy the side channel i don't know if anything's uh he said the pcp was uh
03:21:57 oh the pcp oh that's that's you know he's he's extricated himself i don't know i mean uh
03:22:05 listen i can't explain why people do the things they do i'll never know and neither will name
03:22:14 and he not he just he just refuses he will simply he will simply refuse to speak on the matter
03:22:19 uh you get it like a another job again recently no one knows you want to explain uh i don't i mean
03:22:28 to be honest i don't i don't really know like i don't really talk to him about it much he doesn't
03:22:33 like tell me things i don't know i i do kind of know what's going on with him but i feel like
03:22:39 he wouldn't appreciate me like divulging what he's up to and stuff i just uh it's nothing
03:22:47 remember he made a big i don't i don't really have it i don't really have anything like a
03:22:52 super interesting to say but uh just remember uh when he started doing a bunch of youtube videos
03:22:59 he made a big deal about how he quit his job to do youtube full time um yeah and then but then he
03:23:05 doesn't really upload that frequently anymore and then people people said he did less videos
03:23:10 after he went full time yeah so i just assumed that he got a job again later but uh i don't know
03:23:16 um i i don't feel like i should you don't have to confirm one way or the other about it
03:23:27 i mean honestly he doesn't really owe us i feel like and i feel like he would he would
03:23:32 he would tell people what he's up to if he wanted people to know what he's up to
03:23:37 yeah i um i respect that you know i kind of uh i don't divulge many details about myself
03:23:44 and and unlike and unlike stuff like the pcp uh like rad contenters unlike that like that's not
03:23:51 that's his business so like whatever yeah i'll i'll leave it to him to talk about his life
03:23:57 if he wants to also nice try chrono we all know that you're a head executive at a pharmaceutical
03:24:03 company wait why i don't know yeah you gotta you got me is that just one of my silly little eyes
03:24:11 remember that one oh i get it i get it uh yeah um dan you know what you you i think your output
03:24:18 your video output would be a lot higher if you weren't like you know if you weren't working
03:24:23 in mergers and acquisitions at like tesla corporation like that must that must be really
03:24:28 like really putting a lot of pressure on you and the he needs to get the hyper loop yeah it's um
03:24:35 it's a lot of work going to the bank and cashing checks and stuff
03:24:38 it's it's it's a lot of work uh it's a lot of work um you're in charge of going going to court
03:24:45 to argue yes i know yes elon said he would buy twitter but he didn't mean it he didn't mean it
03:24:50 when he signed all those documents your honor he was a joke look he put a little he put a little
03:24:55 420 next to he drew a little he drew a little cool s next to his name that's this that's an s for
03:25:00 sarcastic he did a backslash s what more do you want what it's right there it's right there on
03:25:08 twitter sir you can see it see it all the post history is pristine uh the next voicemail is
03:25:15 just ben's weekly reminder play deltarune chapter two okay the one after that ben's weekly reminder
03:25:22 the one after that ben's weekly reminder get laid no way
03:25:26 uh i will not reminder ben by the way and casey forgot and you can't make me you can't make me
03:25:36 um yeah i assume this has happened for a couple weeks now uh i don't think i don't know if there
03:25:45 was a get laid last week i hope i hope whoever whoever like thoughtfully was making a voicemail
03:25:53 knows that uh the the weekly reminder to get laid i got it before you did i'm sorry yeah uh well um
03:26:02 this uh the there's one more and i think this is the last voicemail ever ever ever we will never
03:26:11 be another no i will i will make space um but uh wait i already downloaded it it is called
03:26:19 ethan ralph junior will kill you yet ben sains uh three two one go
03:26:33 i may be a baby but i pray to god and jesus with all my might that i may grow
03:26:43 and be powerful enough to kill ben saint if my name ain't ethan waltz jenia
03:26:57 that's the name amen
03:27:05 so all right so so so business is usual with uh with ethan or ethan jr um from what i
03:27:13 gathered when i was catching up uh this this guy called in and he started doing a samurai
03:27:20 thing right yes uh i assume he has stopped doing that and um no uh well i think the i think ethan
03:27:32 ralph is the samurai reincarnated actually yeah but yeah i think this is technically a continuation
03:27:39 but from what i understood that the guy who did that one was not the same person who does the uh
03:27:46 the other samurai sama voicemails so it's sort of like a non-canon it yes continuation
03:27:54 yes that's correct but it seems like there's no samurai mentions at all in this one so maybe
03:28:00 this guy has spun it off into his own it's it's now just the adventures of the baby that and great
03:28:08 now a samurai and a baby wants to kill ben well which which uh which one aren't there two babies
03:28:17 and the baby might also be the samurai depending on what you consider canon to these voicemails
03:28:24 oh god can we get a lecture on this stuff it's kind of it's kind of open to interpretation
03:28:28 honestly honestly pcp voicemail lore lecture i like what a fucking like masturbatory lecture idea
03:28:35 i've heard i've heard stupider ideas uh i guess um wait a minute wait a minute
03:28:44 earlier in this episode
03:28:48 oh no i would know it'll not a lecture i just remembered i feel like i had a good idea for a
03:28:53 video and i remembered it was uh it was um wait was it phenotopia yeah yeah you what would i make
03:29:03 a video about why did i think oh i should make a video about that like what would i what would i
03:29:06 say about uh the aesthetic of the game reminds you of megaman legends yeah i guess like games like
03:29:15 that maybe huh maybe maybe something maybe i was thinking like the history of the development
03:29:23 of it or something because like that guy's been vlogging not vlogging that guy's been
03:29:27 blogging his development for like 15 years really uh yeah uh shit i forget his name
03:29:35 i think he's like i think he's korean or something uh but uh whatever um
03:29:44 the uh no it's good legends is uh is a legend at this point
03:29:51 hey there we go there's there's a there's a chrono a chrono ism it's about 25 years old
03:29:56 now at this point megaman legends yeah i think so would it come out in like late 90s 97 yeah
03:30:03 yeah okay wait same year as something else my birth yes megaman x4
03:30:12 maybe 97 that's uh yeah someone would be x4 someone said that something else some other game
03:30:18 came out in 1997 earlier on this podcast final fantasy seven was it i thought that was 99
03:30:26 no that one 99 was eight yeah oh okay um i don't know whatever uh i'll listen back to this episode
03:30:35 and i'll recall everything that i forgot in the course of making it of course yeah actually listen
