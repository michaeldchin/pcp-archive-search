00:00:00 Alright Munchy, we're back. We're back for frog fractions. We found frog fractions.
00:00:06 It's time to continue the story where we left off. Everything we said in the last
00:00:13 Radifuckers Cop Killers wasn't canon. This is canon though. This is frog fractions too,
00:00:19 I believe, I think. I'm led to believe. This is the only thing that will be in scriptures,
00:00:24 this and the last one. This will be the only thing worth celebrating.
00:00:30 Just like an alt universe. An alt universe of Munchy and Bin. This is the real universe, canon
00:00:36 universe. Who just came online on my Skype, a little man named FngR. What a coincidence.
00:00:46 Let's invite him on the show, Munchy. Let's invite FngR on the show. After all, he's been
00:00:51 such a good friend to me. He's really reached out. He's reached out to me. Like so
00:00:59 often and just with such tenderness. He's just a good guy. He's just a good guy with a lot to
00:01:07 offer the world. He's just a little sweetheart. Roach is a sweetheart. He just knows how to get
00:01:13 into your skin in a good way and like pollute your bones with kindness. My bones are real polluted.
00:01:20 Real polluted. What is this game? Well, I mean, I guess it's like a roguelike.
00:01:29 Man, there's so many messages. Okay. Okay. Cage. I mean, it looks like I found a towel.
00:01:42 Okay, if I hit Q and W, I punch myself. Oh, it's not good. Oh, did I like knock myself out?
00:01:50 Did I like die from that? I think you'd like teleport it back. I think if you die, then you just die.
00:01:55 Oh, yeah. I mean, I still have the towel, so I guess I didn't die.
00:02:02 This doesn't look very froggy or fraction-y. No, you're right. You're right. And yet,
00:02:09 and yet I know in my heart that this is frog fractions.
00:02:12 I can't take this.
00:02:18 By the way, my cursor and my keyboard are being real shitty in... Oh, gems.
00:02:22 They're being real shitty and unresponsive because we're... Oh, what?
00:02:26 I feel like I didn't explore this room thoroughly. Yeah, because we're using Skype,
00:02:31 because to share screen so you could see this fucking game, I need the cyan key. Okay.
00:02:37 We had to go back to Skype. We had to go fucking back in time. We had to go back
00:02:40 to the past like Samurai Jack. Yeah. Like the Samurai Jack. Yeah, yeah. We had to
00:02:48 hashtag MaxreviveSkype, which I mean... The worst part of the entire face of the fucking planet.
00:02:55 I don't know how they could have made it worse. Short of just not making calls at all,
00:03:02 I don't see how Skype could be any worse of a program.
00:03:05 Mm-hmm. It's so bloated and unoptimized, and then just the... It's so resource-intensive,
00:03:15 and for what? For a worse product or something that's then Discord.
00:03:20 Like Discord works? Why doesn't Skype work? Just make it work.
00:03:25 I don't understand. What is happening right now?
00:03:29 It's too dangerous to let you pass without a sword. Oh, but I can just
00:03:34 go past anyway. No, I think I'm going to listen to him. I'm going to try and get a sword.
00:03:40 There's gems up here. I want those. Harvest, though.
00:03:44 Welcome to the Texworld character creator. Oh, dude, what face should I be?
00:03:49 Oh, dude.
00:03:50 Blueberry Pie, Woodland Meadows. Lapis-Lazuli.
00:03:53 Lapis-Lazuli, apparently. Rose Quartz.
00:03:56 Rose Quartz. Holy shit. Moonlit Walk, Vanilla Snowfin.
00:04:01 Mass Effect 2 save.
00:04:03 Yeah, okay. I'm going to do that one.
00:04:09 This is my actual desktop. This is my actual desktop folder.
00:04:13 If you actually had...
00:04:14 It's the PCP folder.
00:04:16 Oh my god.
00:04:18 Here's all the files from Ben and Jackie's College Fund.
00:04:22 There's spoilers there. We can't look at that.
00:04:24 Wow. Do you have Mass Effect 2 on Steam?
00:04:28 No.
00:04:29 I do. Do you want me to play Mass Effect 2 for a little bit,
00:04:32 get a save file, and then give it to you and see what happens?
00:04:36 Yes. Yes, I do.
00:04:40 Can you fucking give me your Mass Effect 2 save file?
00:04:43 Yeah. I just find it inside of my computer and then give it to you. I'm fairly certain.
00:04:49 Oh, I've got... Maybe Pokemon Showdown will work.
00:04:54 Teams.
00:04:55 Ninja Bugs team, which I never finished making.
00:04:58 All right. No, that's not going to do it.
00:05:00 Dude. Dude.
00:05:03 All right.
00:05:04 So, while you get your Mass Effect 2 file...
00:05:10 I actually nearly download Mass Effect 2, but it'll be fine.
00:05:13 Okay. Well, I'll just... I'll come back. I'll come back for that.
00:05:18 Yeah.
00:05:19 So, yeah, so a lot's happened between...
00:05:23 Since two Rowdy fuckers cop killers ago.
00:05:28 We were just making a nice little quaint frog fractions let's play for the masses on our channel.
00:05:34 We were just talking about what's real and dear to our hearts.
00:05:40 I don't know who could have faulted us for just sharing God's honest truth,
00:05:46 but it did. There was a stir. There was a kerfuffle. There was a cutie mark kerfuffle.
00:05:53 There was a single strife that I know about, a single strife.
00:05:59 A meat minuscule of a strife, if you will.
00:06:02 Meat minuscule.
00:06:06 Yeah, we got attacked. We got...
00:06:09 We got flat. We got trolled.
00:06:11 We got viciously attacked by some internet bullies and trolls.
00:06:16 Weakness, cage matches, okay.
00:06:19 All we wanted to do was just make content and, you know, just be ourselves.
00:06:25 But the powers that be wouldn't allow us.
00:06:27 That's too much for some people. That's too much for small minds.
00:06:31 Yeah.
00:06:33 We're the next Elon Mux, the Rowdy fuckers cop killers.
00:06:36 Oh, what the fuck is happening?
00:06:39 Seems like kind of cool, but also like what the fuck is even happening.
00:06:43 I mean, I'm pretty sure most of this is just bullshit that I can ignore and it doesn't matter.
00:06:49 Like, all these messages are stupid and I'm pretty sure I should just stop reading them.
00:06:54 I got some orange soapstone.
00:06:56 That's...
00:06:57 Oh my god.
00:06:58 Nice.
00:06:58 Soapstone.
00:06:59 Lie ahead.
00:07:04 It said Mass Effect 2 specifically, right?
00:07:07 Yeah, yeah, it was Mass Effect 2.
00:07:08 Because that's the only one I have.
00:07:10 It's a bowl full of wicker balls.
00:07:14 Oh, shit.
00:07:14 I can't carry any more gems.
00:07:17 What the fuck's even the point then?
00:07:20 Maybe I can buy stuff with them?
00:07:22 Maybe I have to spend some.
00:07:25 What's even the point of a system like that?
00:07:26 There's stuff like that in Zelda.
00:07:28 What's even the point?
00:07:30 Like, of limiting how much money you can carry?
00:07:32 Yeah.
00:07:33 Ah, just the fuck with you.
00:07:34 Just like to make you feel bad.
00:07:36 Okay, good.
00:07:38 Video game developers like to make the twisted cistern.
00:07:42 The Twister Caliborn.
00:07:44 I can't take this.
00:07:45 And I can't take this.
00:07:47 I can't carry any more gems.
00:07:48 What's the fucking point?
00:07:50 All right, I'm going home.
00:07:51 My home, I mean down.
00:07:54 Briefcase full of cash.
00:07:57 Okay, okay.
00:08:00 Let me...
00:08:00 All right.
00:08:01 All right.
00:08:03 There's a couple more.
00:08:04 There's a couple more side paths that I can check out while we're...
00:08:09 While we're looking for that save file.
00:08:10 This is what video games used to actually look like, right?
00:08:13 Like, this is what like real video games looked like.
00:08:15 Yeah.
00:08:16 I mean, this is what Dwarf Fortress looks like today.
00:08:19 Well, we have a Dwarf Fortress.
00:08:20 This is incredible.
00:08:22 Yeah.
00:08:22 Dwarf Fortress is...
00:08:24 Oh, it...
00:08:25 Federal insanity.
00:08:29 I used to play.
00:08:29 I used to play a bunch of Dwarf Fortress.
00:08:31 Dwarf Fortress is cool, dude.
00:08:33 It's really cool.
00:08:36 But, you know, the thing I eventually decided about Dwarf Fortress
00:08:39 is that it's more fun to like talk about and think about
00:08:42 than it is to actually play.
00:08:44 A little bit.
00:08:45 A little bit.
00:08:45 I got to a point where I was like,
00:08:48 I've played Dwarf Fortress a bunch.
00:08:50 I've kind of mastered the systems, but not like the advanced systems.
00:08:54 And I just don't know how much...
00:08:55 Like, I feel like I get it.
00:08:57 And I've got like some good Dwarf Fortress stories.
00:08:59 I've had some real fun times, but like...
00:09:02 I get it, you know?
00:09:04 Like, I see you.
00:09:04 I see you the writing on the wall.
00:09:07 Yeah.
00:09:08 Yeah, you're right.
00:09:09 Oh, damn idiot.
00:09:11 God, I wonder if I can even make it.
00:09:16 I think you just have to like hold down air.
00:09:18 You have to go just as soon as the blue like disappears.
00:09:22 All right.
00:09:25 You have to go fast.
00:09:26 Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.
00:09:29 I actually think that maybe like my shitty Skype fucking with my keyboard
00:09:34 might like be messing up my ability to do this challenge.
00:09:38 Oh, God, I just want it.
00:09:41 It like freezes for a second for me.
00:09:44 This guy just cannot fucking keep up with this.
00:09:46 You know what?
00:09:47 Okay, I think I can get it.
00:09:48 I feel confident.
00:09:49 Yeah.
00:09:53 I can't hold it.
00:09:54 I have to mash.
00:09:55 How many things have you stolen before?
00:09:56 Have you stolen anything?
00:09:58 Yeah, I've stolen stuff.
00:10:00 Yeah, like what?
00:10:01 Um, I've like shoplifted stuff.
00:10:05 Oh, yeah, that's big time shit.
00:10:07 That's big time shit, bro.
00:10:12 Yeah, I'm a big I'm a big time like groceries launderer.
00:10:16 No, I've like I've like stolen groceries.
00:10:19 Like some like I stole some like the first time I think I ever stole anything.
00:10:24 I was in California and I was real poor and I and I like I just went to the grocery store
00:10:29 to buy some like rice because like that's what I was eating at the time.
00:10:34 And hang on, let me let the cat out.
00:10:37 Cat out of the bag, cat's already out of the bag, Nate.
00:10:40 I mean, Ben.
00:10:41 Okay, goodbye.
00:10:43 Fuck, monkey, lunchie.
00:10:47 And like I went to buy some shitty groceries and I saw some gushers and I just really wanted
00:10:53 the gushers.
00:10:53 Like I knew I didn't want to spend the like six dollars on a box of gushers,
00:10:59 but I was like, but I really want those gushers, but I don't want to pay for them.
00:11:03 So I just bought my I picked them up and I bought my other groceries and I went and I
00:11:07 checked them out at the fucking self-checkout line and I just didn't swipe the gushers and
00:11:11 I just put them in my grocery bag and I just walked out with these box of gushers.
00:11:16 And yeah, I've done it.
00:11:18 I've done that a bunch.
00:11:19 I've done that a bunch of times.
00:11:21 It's good.
00:11:22 That's like federalized.
00:11:24 Like like all my students are like small scale, like, you know, like, like, like, like
00:11:29 just like take a little bit of like, like, like, like, like one time I was at a guy's
00:11:33 house where I didn't really like in like fifth grade.
00:11:36 And I just stole his like little like, like, like a full of Minko, like fucking, uh,
00:11:41 you know, the, the, the pink where it's long next.
00:11:44 I still like little Minko.
00:11:45 Yeah.
00:11:46 I still, I stole a little bit of a like a statue, a statue just because I thought it was cool.
00:11:53 Um, did he ever notice?
00:11:55 No.
00:11:56 Um, no, I, I, I like, you know, actually this is, this is a good time to bring this up.
00:12:03 Um, I, because I don't know when else this would come up, but like there was a PCP.
00:12:08 I forget which one there was a PCP where like the, like me shoplifting came up and I like
00:12:14 said it and then I got like scared about it and was like, and like didn't know if like people
00:12:18 would be like, oh, he's a, he's a bad guy.
00:12:20 So I like went back and edited that and it was too bad because there was like a real good story.
00:12:25 I don't remember what the story was, but there was like a real good story that I had to cut
00:12:28 out because it was like interwoven with like the fact that I have shop lifted before in my life.
00:12:35 Yeah.
00:12:36 Which like, I don't, I don't really think it's a big deal.
00:12:39 Like on, on, on, in hindsight, I'm like, I don't really think anyone is going to care that much.
00:12:45 Yeah.
00:12:45 To me, like I wouldn't, like I wouldn't do it at like a mom and pop store.
00:12:49 I wouldn't do it at like a small local business, but at like a chain, like at like a Walmart or
00:12:54 a stop and shop, like fuck them. Who cares? They're not people. Corporations are not people
00:12:59 and they don't deserve, they don't deserve moral consideration of any kind.
00:13:03 So I don't feel, I feel like, and not only do I not feel like it's a bad thing to do,
00:13:07 I actively feel like it's a good thing to do.
00:13:10 Yeah.
00:13:10 It's great.
00:13:11 Yeah.
00:13:12 Okay.
00:13:12 If I go to a Walmart and I just put a cashier at gunpoint, then, you know, it's just a good
00:13:17 thing because they're part of the, they're a cog in the machine, dude.
00:13:20 You gotta break my auditioning.
00:13:22 Yeah, they're like, they're part of the problem.
00:13:25 Oh my gosh.
00:13:26 You're way too fucking slow, dude.
00:13:28 I really feel like, damn it, phone. I really feel like this should be working and just like,
00:13:34 my keyboard is not doing what I'm telling it to do.
00:13:38 This is like, I'm playing this game on hard mode right now.
00:13:43 Oh my god. Oh my fucking god.
00:13:46 Hey, can you go like, like go to like where you're about to jump into it and then like,
00:13:50 can you go up?
00:13:51 No, I can't because there's water.
00:13:56 Hmm.
00:13:57 It's like, it's like a zigzag path I have to take.
00:13:59 And maybe you can't see it on screen share.
00:14:03 Oh, oh, okay.
00:14:04 Yeah.
00:14:05 Yeah.
00:14:05 I see.
00:14:05 I see.
00:14:06 I see.
00:14:07 Oh yeah.
00:14:07 That's so fucked.
00:14:09 It's like, I'll go like, like I'll,
00:14:15 maybe I'll just hit the keys slower.
00:14:17 Oh my god.
00:14:22 Oh my god.
00:14:23 I am so upset.
00:14:25 It can't be, you know, maybe it is impossible.
00:14:28 Maybe it's just impossible and it's just here to fuck with me,
00:14:31 but that would make me so mad.
00:14:33 So it can't be like, it can't be true because it would make me mad if it were true.
00:14:38 I'm just gonna just go on the internet until lies.
00:14:42 Do you really think someone would do that?
00:14:44 This is what the hell looks like.
00:14:50 This is what we get for stealing.
00:14:52 This is our punishment.
00:14:54 Oh, did you fucking see that?
00:14:56 Yeah.
00:14:57 Okay.
00:14:57 I think I can do it.
00:14:57 I think I can do it.
00:15:05 Oh god.
00:15:06 I'm going to kill myself.
00:15:07 I'm going to kill myself.
00:15:08 I'm going to kill myself.
00:15:09 Myself, Mike.
00:15:10 Yeah.
00:15:10 I, I really do think that Skype is fucking up though.
00:15:15 Oh, yeah.
00:15:18 No, it's definitely Skype because I can see my, oh shit.
00:15:21 I can see my cursor flickering and it's very upsetting.
00:15:28 Like whatever, like whatever that fucking square root sign is up in the top left,
00:15:32 like I just want it more than life itself.
00:15:38 What if you can't even carry it?
00:15:41 I can carry it.
00:15:43 I got a towel.
00:15:43 Of course I can get a square root, a squirt for short.
00:15:48 Oh wait, I can, maybe I should just hold it.
00:15:56 Oh, I fucking did it.
00:15:57 I'm a genius.
00:16:00 Good luck and try Fleur de Lis.
00:16:01 All right.
00:16:03 Fleur de Lis, that's a pony.
00:16:06 Is it?
00:16:06 That's a pony.
00:16:08 Be wary of butts, insulated boots ahead.
00:16:12 Oh, I got it.
00:16:13 I got it.
00:16:15 I did it.
00:16:17 I have done it.
00:16:19 Can you get through the other side?
00:16:21 No, your way is blocked by dire shrubs.
00:16:23 No, I think I just got to die.
00:16:25 Okay, there we go.
00:16:28 Let's try through here.
00:16:31 Blocked by water.
00:16:34 Is this a bank?
00:16:35 Yeah, it looks like a bank.
00:16:37 All right, I guess.
00:16:38 Until it gets it's gray and it makes you want to kill yourself.
00:16:42 It looks like it.
00:16:43 You know what?
00:16:43 I think those black blocks are supposed to be stained glass windows.
00:16:46 So I think maybe it's a church.
00:16:48 Oh, maybe.
00:16:51 The lion bunker.
00:16:55 Good luck.
00:16:57 Again, like it can't go anywhere.
00:17:00 It's blocked by shrubs and water.
00:17:02 All right, so that's a bust.
00:17:06 That's a bust.
00:17:07 It's a bust.
00:17:08 You have a sword yet?
00:17:09 Maybe what you think you just got up is a sword.
00:17:13 Yeah, maybe.
00:17:15 You need the red key to unlock this door.
00:17:19 Need no bless oblige and try pressed digitization.
00:17:23 Okay, so this is like some Dark Souls stuff.
00:17:26 So like need skates and imminent flaming tomb.
00:17:30 Again, blocked by shrubs, blocked by water.
00:17:33 Oh, I can push crates.
00:17:35 Oh, shit.
00:17:36 Oh, this might.
00:17:37 I wonder if maybe I could have progressed before.
00:17:41 Amazing trap.
00:17:42 Amazing trap ahead.
00:17:48 I can't believe the story you're telling me.
00:17:50 It's macabre.
00:17:54 I bet I can get that bracket.
00:17:57 You get that fucking bracket, bro.
00:17:59 I'm so fucking.
00:18:00 I'm having so much fucking fun with this game, munchie.
00:18:02 Oh, you might have fucked up.
00:18:04 I found a pair of auto correct skates.
00:18:07 Oh, shit.
00:18:09 Nice.
00:18:10 All right.
00:18:11 I did it.
00:18:12 You just auto.
00:18:14 Oh, if space, I can doff skates.
00:18:16 You need you need the white key to take off the skates.
00:18:19 Oh, fuck.
00:18:21 Okay.
00:18:21 Well, whatever.
00:18:22 Like I'm fine with them on.
00:18:24 Oh, that's a monster.
00:18:26 Okay, I've got all the I've got all the gems I need.
00:18:29 Anyway, we're game.
00:18:32 I'm totally I'm just so fucking immersed inside this video game.
00:18:36 Me too, dude.
00:18:36 I like I'm like I'm loving this like not even as like a joke.
00:18:41 Gorilla Grove.
00:18:44 The Gorilla Grove.
00:18:45 Oh, the thing is like fucking going crazy at me.

00:18:58 Now that I've got all the gems I can carry,
00:19:00 the gems are like an impediment.
00:19:03 Okay.
00:19:04 You know what?
00:19:04 I can do this.
00:19:05 This is how they punish greed, Ben.

00:19:30 That's deep and it's important.
00:19:31 The two way slider doesn't move.
00:19:34 Oh, God.
00:19:38 At some points, I think in this like, yeah,
00:19:40 abstract art style is actually like benefiting it
00:19:43 because it's like, you know, you use your imagination.
00:19:45 That's kind of magical.
00:19:46 Other times I just think I just cannot fucking understand
00:19:48 what is happening.
00:19:50 I understand everything.
00:19:51 Oh, I found the red key.
00:19:52 Red.

00:21:11 Okay.
00:21:11 I think I got what I needed to get.
00:21:14 Although I kind of want to, I feel like those white blocks over there
00:21:17 are going to give me like an important message.
00:21:21 Master using it.
00:21:23 I got a master this, I got a master the Megasword.
00:21:27 How?
00:21:29 Shit.

00:21:41 God, fucking physical media.
00:21:44 Yeah, what the fuck dude?
00:21:46 Why did it ever exist?
00:21:48 Why, why was there a time when we needed to have physical like anything?
00:21:53 Yeah.
00:21:54 It was bad.
00:21:55 Like it was bad.
00:21:56 It was a bad time.
00:21:57 And like history will frown upon it.
00:22:00 It was like even worse than slavery or killing gays.
00:22:04 I mean it was maybe a lot worse than either of those put together.
00:22:12 Play Master 2?
00:22:13 Yeah, of course.
00:22:18 Oh wait, I see, I see.
00:22:21 I got here before but I couldn't go anywhere because the crate
00:22:26 because the crate, I hate these monsters.

00:22:31 All right, now here's what you need to do, Ben.
00:22:34 What's that?
00:22:34 You need to open up, here I'm going to start, I'm going to do my screen share
00:22:38 and then you like put the window like off of the side

00:22:44 on the other side of the screen.
00:22:46 Okay, I'll try my best.

00:34:38 answer by I don't have audio on I can't hear what I'm answering it's it's good
00:34:45 it's actually better this way cuz like the let if you don't know the question
00:34:49 then your answer will reveal like who you truly are you know no yeah I'm just
00:34:55 answering by it's widely exactly exactly think about it when Lego Star Wars not
00:35:05 like Star Wars but like like Lego Star that's Lego Star Wars that was like that
00:35:09 was very very Lego Star Wars this is like like like they fucking really like
00:35:14 um um Josh Josh scorcher as creator of as creator of Mass Effect we were
00:35:21 wondering what your biggest influence influences were and he'll say well um
00:35:25 well Munchie I was heavily influenced the story was heavily modeled after my
00:35:30 favorite video game Lego Star Wars to the Phantom Menace and and you know the
00:35:37 rest is history did you ever play Lego Star Wars no never never played a Lego
00:35:42 game like Lego Star Wars actually great because okay this is the most like
00:35:45 satisfying like sound ever is like like many kids are like basically like like
00:35:50 just like these like items can't throw at the level and you know if like if you
00:35:53 collect them all you get like 100% and the sound it makes is like this was
00:36:01 satisfying fucking thing you could ever hear in your entire life you know what
00:36:07 this actually looks kind of cool it's like space this this part this part I
00:36:12 like I like this part I'm like uh find a save point like you find a safe find a
00:36:18 save point dude wrong wait wait wait wait wait does this game have save
00:36:22 points wait you know what I'm gonna say I think you've already got a save file
00:36:27 because I'm pretty sure it auto saves whenever you make a decision really I
00:36:31 think so yeah let me just get the next load yeah yeah here here let me wait for
00:36:35 this cutscene and then I'll I'm gonna quit cuz I do not want this for any
00:36:39 month longer than I have to no don't be stupid fucking fag yeah like like look
00:36:47 at like look at the difference like like which of these men is straight like
00:36:51 just ask yourself like like looking at them like what do you guys got the
00:36:55 mischievous grin he's got the you know wild personality yeah clearly
00:37:00 sexual all the straight guy yeah yeah yeah am I like a girl is that what's
00:37:10 happening are you I mean yes but women can't space no they're they're hymens
00:37:21 just go haywire yeah when you enter when you leave Earth's atmosphere they're
00:37:26 uterus just cannot compute they just it just starts fucking up this is the
00:37:30 inside of women's uterus when like this is what this scene is about yeah this is
00:37:39 the end like if you pick a female character yeah
00:37:43 this is the end of the game I mean it's a space adventure no it's more like a
00:37:57 fucking real life like like this is like the red pill this is it like this is the
00:38:05 much the much Ballyhood red pill I think I think she's done for anyone play a
00:38:14 video game and think that it's okay to do I don't know like I can't I don't know
00:38:20 anyone I don't know anyone that really thinks it's okay like like there's a
00:38:24 really thought about it because really like sat down and like look taken a long
00:38:28 look in the mirror and thought like is it okay to play this video game and come
00:38:32 back with an affirmative answer oh my god doesn't happen frog fractions to frog
00:38:37 fractions to baby I'm pretty sure you can just like close it and like you'll
00:38:51 have a save file all right although I don't know how you'll find the same
00:38:55 I can't I can't do it I can't I can't I can't escape you can't control all

00:44:41 kindling zero I guess I'll buy I guess wait I have to like sell the kindling like
00:45:06 I need less fuel so that I don't go go too high okay it's like oh man this is like a
00:45:15 parody of all of my favorite video games all like the bullshit addictive like the
00:45:21 bullshit this is this is like the kind of bullshit that like Magikarp jump is and
00:45:25 like I fucking love games like Magikarp jump where you just like accumulate shit
00:45:29 you just like hit imaginary milestones and accumulate meaningless crap but like
00:45:34 it's all like a self it's all like a self a self fulfilling oh go go down go go
00:45:41 down how do we go down how do we go down I've sold I've sold everything no go
00:46:02 down no go down you fucker no no alright oh you oh you you buy it you buy it for
00:46:20 fuel okay so you add fuel to get your temperature up and then you spend the
00:46:27 temperature to buy the fuel which increases your temperature regularly so I wonder if
00:46:40 there's any way I wonder if there's any way to reduce your temperature because that's

00:47:06 we're good I've got it figured out I've got the strategy oh my fucking god I love it I
00:47:12 love this game dupe dupe dupe leisurely I bet that Munchie is gonna I bet we're gonna go
00:47:28 through oh shit we're gonna go through all this rigmarole to get a mass effect to get
00:47:33 the mass effect to save and I bet it's not even like I bet it'll do something but not
00:47:38 like something that's actually good but that's fine that's fine actually oh there we go yeah yeah

00:47:58 fucking good at video games do you know what I'm saying whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa okay okay
00:48:15 this red thing bad oh god god it looks the red thing reminds me of like the Sims when
00:48:25 something bad happens what um oh I think the red I think it might be a symbol I think it's an
00:48:37 ASCII symbol that maybe I was like I'm here to get I think I may have achieved what I was supposed
00:48:42 to achieve here but I just just really like this game I just really like this one I'm just gonna
00:48:47 fuck around with it until either Munchie gets back or I get like really bored which I mean stranger
00:48:59 things have happened but I have infinite patience I have infinite patience for video games that's why
00:49:04 I'm so fucking good at video games I'm just like I will just play I will just play the worst game

01:14:34 all right I don't I don't want to do this I don't want to play this fucking
01:14:38 toaster game it's all right okay um I think I think this is the way to advance
01:14:50 by beating this this mini game I may I may have fucked this up oh wait no no
01:14:59 no wait yes I fucked it up okay let's try it again yeah a big deal a big deal
01:15:05 we just we just gotta do it okay it's okay it's easy there we go
01:15:14 and some right on some on some matters of more importance
01:15:21 you don't you don't you don't understand yet I don't I don't understand you don't
01:15:32 understand yet but you will
01:15:39 oh god look at this shit here it's approaching so slowly and yeah I can
01:15:44 feel I can feel it on my bones like I can't I don't know if I can even explain
01:15:51 like why this is so bad but just it just oh no I'm fucked yeah idiot I don't know
01:15:59 why bad
01:16:05 because the way the way that you get height is you buy fuel and then you
01:16:09 gradually gain height but like initially buying the fuel costs you height
01:16:14 that's ridiculous yeah it's it's I'm if I can beat it I'm gonna feel really good
01:16:21 about myself and really excited and feel like I'm what is inside of the toaster
01:16:25 toast when you die some toast comes out okay I will feel like floppy thing going around is
01:16:32 that the frog no that's a wing oh that's a wing on the side of the toaster oh incredible
01:16:47 no no yeah yeah I was doing I was doing way better before I got through like five of them
01:16:52 oh damn dude yeah I know I know
01:17:01 I mean you'll see what happens if you sell uh if you sell you gain some height
01:17:09 and lose some acceleration
01:17:14 yeah oh god
01:17:18 like see I've already fucked up because I'm too high now and the only way to lose
01:17:22 height is to like buy like that yeah fuck okay now we're good for now
01:17:36 um do you have anything left anything left to do what like like like you have any fuel left
01:17:43 you're originally gonna run out right no you like gradually gain fuel
01:17:48 oh god please please please please please please
01:18:00 but you know what I've actually figured it out I've actually like figured out that the way to
01:18:03 like control your height oh my god what the fuck is that I think this is like what I need
01:18:08 from this minigame I think I need to like get this and take it back
01:18:12 okay you know I figured out the way the way to control your height is to like quickly buy and
01:18:17 then sell yeah okay so like it's like the stock market buying sell buying sell
01:18:25 I've got it okay you know what I've got a I've got a plan I've got the plan now um okay okay
01:18:33 no uh oh am I am I good or what am I fucking good or what you're god but you're god oh my god
01:18:40 that was the scariest fucking thing ever oh my god I almost I almost clipped the edge um good
01:18:46 oh god no I fucked up yeah I fucked up I should have bought molotov okay you know what I was real
01:18:52 close we did good we did good so we have that thing all right good like can you do anything with
01:18:59 it or is it just with you I think you just have to like get it and then win look at all these
01:19:05 fucking buildings in the background you can feel there's a brony each one of them
01:19:09 at like each window each window hides a brony yeah that's just like it's just looking out the
01:19:14 window and just like just like ready to like be ready to like censor us yeah ready to attack

01:24:26 someone could be yeah even though like everyone around me was it yeah it's like like i just feel
01:24:32 like if you're from like spain or portugal then you like you you like you are like in a different
01:24:37 realm like you do not exist in the same space me obviously cannot like me no in like our shared

01:26:17 do you think you can speed run it probably really fast oh yeah yeah like i'll bet if you know exactly
01:26:22 what you're doing you can do it and like like you like like if you know exactly where the keys are
01:26:29 and exactly how to like solve the puzzle like if i had known if i had known that i had to like
01:26:35 fail at one of those cracks in the ground then like i could have beaten that mini game in like
01:26:41 a second and a half would have taken would have taken me uh damn it oh frustrating you should probably

01:41:55 yeah okay yeah just restart then there was a duo is it working analyst who went by the name of
01:42:02 cake standard and phantom horn they starred in their own series known as two best brothers
01:42:08 bitch about ponies where they basically sat in front of their microphones and did commentaries on
01:42:13 the newest episode of mlp not personally not what tbap was i really think much is completely
01:42:18 mischaracterized it wasn't really presented in a way that was interesting more it wasn't really
01:42:25 presented in a way that was interesting as he shows a clip of two live action pony figures
01:42:29 rocking back and forth the sound of like the commentary yeah yeah like what's being shown here
01:42:37 is clearly not of any interest yeah just about any of any kind yeah like some like someone like
01:42:43 misanthropony couldn't fucking wrap his head around like this you know this took more work and has
01:42:48 more creativity than the entirety of misanthropony's entire life i agree um misanthropony look at
01:42:55 misanthropony's oc like like just look at misanthropony's oc to understand like the
01:43:00 utter depths like the utter depths of his of like the artistic what the fuck just like the
01:43:07 utter depths of like artistic abandonment and like lack what's like the lack of creativity
01:43:11 that he's that he like lives within yeah like there's nothing on display here that would make me
01:43:17 like believe that a human made it i would think it's like an ai or something yeah like an ai or
01:43:23 maybe a small animal like a bird or a dog yeah um yeah i hate him i did understand the appeal behind
01:43:30 their content at the time they were bringing something unique to the analysis community that
01:43:35 not a lot of people have thought of yeah it was a simple mini series wasn't interesting there was
01:43:39 something about its simplicity that gained at its own fan base thus becoming a huge part of
01:43:44 brony analysis huge part he he thinks he's so clever because he's saying like he's saying there was
01:43:50 something about the simplicity of it like press like press him on that and like what does he actually
01:43:57 mean like can you imagine him actually like meaning anything by that like like yeah this the simplicity
01:44:04 of the matter has nothing to do with it and i don't know what he's trying to describe by simplicity
01:44:09 what simplicity like we made jokes it was like yeah like it like was a review that's pretty simple
01:44:18 like it's way it was way it's way less simple than like the bog standard like fucking pony review
01:44:24 shit that was like you know common like what stood out about it was not its simplicity it was the way
01:44:30 it was different from the rest yeah the way it was presented and like the like like the actual
01:44:35 like timing and like editing and the things that made it different like like it wasn't it would
01:44:40 have been simpler to just do a normal review like with the pony in the corner but you actually like
01:44:45 put work into it and like made like jokes and like intros yeah yeah yeah so like really there's not
01:44:51 it's not the simplicity really is not the appeal no missanthropony uh but after season five their
01:45:01 content was starting to dwindle until eventually it just stopped i'm not even exaggerating when i
01:45:07 use these choice of words these two just disappeared from the face of the fandom without an explanation
01:45:13 completely inaccurate completely not not correct at all yeah there was in fact a lot of videos
01:45:19 explaining where they went and uh if you if you were self aware whatsoever then you would know
01:45:25 exactly how well to the pcp i mean there wasn't there wasn't a video on t-bat but like i don't
01:45:32 know why missanthropony is saying this because like he knows about the procrastinator so like
01:45:37 he knew where we went so like he can't have been confused and and and in like like like there were
01:45:46 obviously ways to get to know the pcp outside like like like even though there was nothing on t-bat
01:45:53 for an unknown reason yeah there was like you know my my deviant art and like my twitter and stuff
01:45:58 yeah and and like you know all those like like phantom plays where he's talking about the pcp
01:46:04 and the vapors and shit oh yeah yeah yeah uh so there's no way he dropped off that was a pony game
01:46:10 you were playing when you were discussing that there's you didn't drop out the face of the fandom
01:46:15 you were easily trackable and it's like and and and the mere idea that he like dropped off the face
01:46:22 of the fucking earth because you stopped making pony content like like because like because like
01:46:28 because this channel stopped uploading videos that's equivalent to me just i just vanished
01:46:34 without a fucking trace yeah there was like nobody could have found me no one completely
01:46:40 indescribable eventually it was discovered that the two decided to split up although they
01:46:46 what in contact with each other and they've been working on their own individual youtube
01:46:50 channels no phantom like it's just a weird way to characterize it it's just a weird way to characterize
01:46:56 what happens the the two split up the two split up but still keep in contact think about no if you
01:47:04 didn't know the situation how would that seem like we're just like we're just each doing things yeah
01:47:12 yeah we aren't yeah we like like imagine if you were got if you if you didn't know anything about
01:47:18 the pcp or tbap and you watch this video you would think that they like you and you and me
01:47:23 or keg sorry i had like a falling out but like and you like you're like you're like stop making
01:47:28 videos together when in fact you just like you just don't do tbap is is the point you just don't do
01:47:36 tbap yeah like all all of what he's saying is to say that we stop making tbap videos yeah like
01:47:43 that's that's all he needed to say here yeah and then oh shit saint who was a member of the horseshoe
01:47:49 crew eventually joined the procrastinator showing my consisting of the original horseshoe
01:47:55 crew as well as a few new why does he say that i joined i'm personally subscribed to the procrastinator
01:48:00 channel because i happen to be a fan of the content that is made by the people who are
01:48:04 part of this team then came the moment where i saw this video in my subscription box and this video
01:48:11 was literally so heinously awful that it almost made me want to unsubscribe from procrastinators
01:48:19 how dressed it starts fencing saint as he prefers these days along with this guy named
01:48:26 munchie i'm going to be talking about some some guy named munchie who like he's never heard of even
01:48:31 though he like follows the talking about every single thing forgive me for leaving anything out
01:48:36 but you have to understand this video is literally over four hours long and seriously who the fuck
01:48:42 has time to listen to four hours of these two guys talking about whatever's on their screen share
01:48:48 yeah yeah who would have time for that thing that like several thousand people
01:48:52 watch we are in the bottom corner right there yeah yeah more than five hours the video named rowdy
01:48:59 fuckers cop killers frog the way he says it i mean they do play the game for a good chunk of time
01:49:07 but literally at least 75 percent of what we see in this video has nothing to do with them playing
01:49:15 frog fractions so much he's hung up on this leading up to the parts that i actually want to talk about
01:49:21 is just this irrelevant commentary with a painfully boring tone and no direction the two sound very
01:49:28 bored and unenthusiastic about the stuff that they're doing which like look what's on look what's on
01:49:35 look what was on screen yeah the big the big baby boy interest from the like how yeah like we're so
01:49:43 bored like we're not having any fun we are we are not we like like we're so we're we're just doing
01:49:49 the right for these couples for money we have no we have no fucking personal and sensitive to do
01:49:54 whatsoever we've yeah we've sold out cold hard cash we sound bored profitable thing to ever exist
01:50:04 and we're only doing it just to sell out and you know make some green it's just amazing to hear
01:50:08 misanthropony like like drag on in his weird monotone like they seem very bored in the video
01:50:16 and it's very uninteresting to hear them talk for literally four hours like for him to say that in
01:50:24 that voice yeah in that voice and the the entire like like like how we like change subjects no rhyme
01:50:33 or reason is the point of the video is that it's not supposed to be a highly edited like like you
01:50:37 know like frog fractions let's play it's the right figures copies which is notorious for being long
01:50:42 and just for the entire show is dedicated to the chemistry of the host that is the point of it
01:50:48 and the video completely smashes your expectations like frog fractions so it's thematically relevant
01:50:53 yeah well i mean obviously all that's gonna be lost on this guy yeah but it's it's weird it's
01:50:59 it's amazing to me like how like he comes back to this point multiple times that like the video
01:51:05 is bad because it is called frog fractions but like not all of it is about frog fractions like
01:51:12 like that makes it bad it like that proves us wrong when that is in fact the point and we wanted
01:51:18 it to be that way yeah they showcase a very strong lack of enthusiasm and that's not a good thing if
01:51:26 you generally want the people watching your video to take it seriously don't want to take it seriously
01:51:31 it's a fucking comedy show is very very slow and there's a lot of parts that really should have
01:51:38 been edited out like if the words frog fractions is going to be in the title of your video you think
01:51:44 that the majority of its content would be relevant to the game they spend entire portions of the
01:51:51 segments just googling themselves and looking up pictures of babies
01:51:59 oh my god with no real rhyme or reason they literally feel like those annoying college students
01:52:06 who spend their free time looking up repetitive material on their computers this is how fucking
01:52:13 bizarre like what like they literally they literally seem like describes a totally innocuous thing
01:52:25 like these people like they literally they literally come off as though they're like
01:52:31 wearing pants and shirts like Jesus what the fuck are we doing we're we're we're college
01:52:39 students who are looking up images online we're looking up repetitive materials on our computers
01:52:46 like the fucking nerve the nerve and and i just want to say like he's going on now and he's
01:52:53 going to continue to go on for a while like criticizing the video as though like the video
01:52:59 being bad is like the point that he's like it's going to come out soon that like he's really he
01:53:04 actually has like a moral objection but for now he's like playing it coy like he's playing it cool
01:53:10 and pretending that he just thinks it's like a bad video and it's not entertaining yeah but like
01:53:14 the truth will come out he's just looking for excuses to shit on it because yeah he just knows
01:53:20 he doesn't like it for one specific thing that happens later yeah so he's just coming up with
01:53:25 like weird like buzzwords fucking he's yeah he's he's he's trying to scrape up he's trying to scrape
01:53:31 all the all the shit he could possibly fling at it he's he's like he's he's trying to he's just
01:53:36 gathering up as much as much ammunition as he can just to take us down a peg yeah because we did
01:53:42 release a video that he didn't like yeah yeah yeah and we should be punished and it was so bad he
01:53:48 almost unsubscribed from our youtube channel oh my fucking god dude it broke him into a fucking
01:53:53 brink of destruction like can you imagine can you imagine being bad upset with someone that you
01:54:00 would unsubscribe from their youtube channel oh okay continue video i have ever seen in my life
01:54:11 and i've been through smut boys channel after a bunch of more rambling that goes nowhere one of
01:54:17 which involving digi bros old time we finally get to them like totally relevant totally relevant
01:54:24 and at this point the focus of the video has gone way off due to the way the video is presented
01:54:30 up to this point it's very clear that they did not know what they wanted it to be about it's
01:54:35 just aimlessly going from one subject to the next without any meaningful segue between any of them
01:54:41 i mean imagine if i made a video named spongebob squarepants obstacle odyssey playthrough and i
01:54:48 play the game for 20 minutes and then the next three hours of the video is just me going through
01:54:53 youtube poops or random artwork on deviantart because i forgot to turn off the recorder
01:54:59 dead so we finally get into no no it's not like that it it's not that we let it we were like like
01:55:07 it's like he thinks we did this by accident yeah like like like we didn't mean to we like like like
01:55:12 like we wanted to have a frog fractions let's play and just play the game but but but due to the
01:55:16 same tip we just had we like due to our ineptitude minded that we just accidentally opened up this
01:55:21 the rift cafe wiki and just started just going haywire we said we just had no saying it whatsoever
01:55:27 and we were just completely the like the slaves of our of our aptitude minded destructive thoughts
01:55:33 we didn't know any better yeah there's just nothing we could do we just accidentally typed
01:55:38 in the rift cafe we just accidentally started going there and we were just the entire video
01:55:46 which was just supposed to be this really like tight concise highly edited let's play because i
01:55:51 know that's what he likes that's the only kind of let's play that he that he views is valuable
01:55:54 so that yeah yeah yeah that's obviously what we were going for too we also have the exact same
01:55:58 you know amount of taste that he has and in exact same way so that's obviously what we were going
01:56:03 for but you but just some just some stroke of of sheer misfortune we we we accidentally opened
01:56:09 up the fucking rift cafe and we just accidentally did all this yeah it's incredible that he can be
01:56:16 like a fan of the pcp and not understand the idea of watching a video that is just two people
01:56:24 in the pcp talking like where's the fucking disconnect here like what's not getting through
01:56:31 i went through a comment chain like like like like last night i was getting like like notes for
01:56:36 this video and i went through it like on the pony cast the the the uh video that the videos like
01:56:43 the podcast that uh jesse and uh hit play yeah yeah uh f not f and g are miss anthra probably
01:56:50 commented on a video that was it was like oh man this is a really good video i really enjoy this
01:56:55 which in and of itself seems like okay he like like obviously he obviously just doesn't like us
01:57:00 or he doesn't like what we said so that's fine it's not the problem he has no problem with the
01:57:03 like the content itself he just wants to you know fuck with us but uh the thing is in that video
01:57:09 jesse comments on this drama and like like doesn't call him by name but like calls miss anthra
01:57:16 weird and he just doesn't pick up on it like he's obviously what it is oh my god yeah you know
01:57:23 you know what here like here's what i okay like what what i know about miss anthra pony is that
01:57:29 miss anthra pony used to be a dick to like tom digi and mage and i think he even says this later
01:57:35 in the video like he used to be he used to like bully them or like call them out and like try and
01:57:39 do hit videos on them because he he like thought they were quote a bad influence like this is his
01:57:45 excuse and like i think what's probably but now he's like super apologetic and like feels super
01:57:52 bad and he's like he's a good boy now you know like he doesn't do that anymore so i think that
01:57:56 probably he at one point he probably like hated jesse at one point and like said nasty things about
01:58:01 jesse and then like someone smarter than him like told him to stop being retarded and then he felt
01:58:07 like super bad and super guilty about it and now he like did a complete 180 on jesse and like now
01:58:12 he thinks jesse is a great guy and a cool guy and like and like so he's not he's gonna like he's
01:58:17 gonna be nice you know like he's not gonna he's not gonna like have any problems with him because
01:58:21 he's been told not to that's my hypothesis yeah because because there's no way he could like
01:58:26 like just like think about it for a little bit and just like come to a different conclusion
01:58:30 like you just have that in his body he can't he can't think he cannot he does not have reason
01:58:37 no i don't i i don't think he does he has no good reason you might you might say you might say
01:58:48 awesome fucking shit into the brony fandom or the analysis community by using the rift wikia as a
01:58:54 source and if they really wanted to make a video ripping into the analysis community this is the
01:59:00 worst way they could have done it i mean it's just them browsing through an incredibly outdated
01:59:06 website and using it as a source to justify their criticisms towards these people i mean okay
01:59:12 considering that past analysis has no information on his tab at all i think it's safe to assume that
01:59:19 this website is long long dead and it certainly should not be used by people who want to make a
01:59:25 point okay first of all no no again he thinks we're coming at this from like a journalistic
01:59:34 standpoint no yeah like he mentions that we're using like the rift wikia as a source for our
01:59:40 bemusement for the brony community when when the only thing we're doing is to like we're like like
01:59:45 vaguely remind us of like our past like our past yeah yeah yeah like our source we're not like
01:59:52 reading this and then making a judgment based on that we're just remembering what happened and you
01:59:56 know we forgot about a lot of these fucking geeks and freaks a long time ago so we're just using this
02:00:01 to like remind oh yeah room lappers and yeah remember that osemer where they did that we didn't
02:00:05 like yeah that's like we have like we have like we have per yeah we have personal experience with
02:00:10 these people like this is not yeah yeah we're not like learning about this for the first time
02:00:17 yeah yeah yeah um although there is like there is one or two people that i'd never heard of
02:00:21 and like i said they were shit and like uh but like whatever like that's different the vast majority
02:00:27 and and and also i think even if we were using this as a source which we aren't yeah uh that would
02:00:33 still be valid because these are like what the people think about them like this yeah like somebody
02:00:39 wrote this is about it them yeah yeah like sure it's outdated but like i'm sorry like find me a
02:00:46 better source then yeah yeah yeah find me a fucking better source miss antherpony what would you
02:00:51 recommend that i use to rip into the brony fandom yeah and and and the only people that we make fun
02:00:58 of like just for it is because we don't like the website itself like the website itself is funny to
02:01:04 us yeah so like it's like it's like when we find someone who we the majority of time we just make
02:01:10 fun of them through the website as a source quote unquote we're just making fun of the website for
02:01:15 being terrible yeah he doesn't get it like he really he really just doesn't he let me
02:01:26 it's just it's just lost on him you know yeah like and i can't i can't believe that this guy
02:01:31 watches the pcp and still doesn't like get what the point of ratty fuckers cop killers is like
02:01:36 that like that doesn't make any sense to me it's just he just completely he will never not be confused
02:01:44 and he just doesn't know he's confused he's confused on the inside and he just doesn't know it
02:01:49 you're so right you're so right he's so confused he's confused about his confusion yeah he he he
02:01:58 thinks he knows things when in reality he doesn't know things and he knows he doesn't know things but
02:02:02 but who cares it doesn't matter like like like he i mean he's still gonna have an opinion like
02:02:09 he's still gonna form an opinion despite knowing that he doesn't know anything yeah yeah yeah why
02:02:14 not because why not what what what what could possibly go wrong good amount of time bitching
02:02:22 about shipping and the analysts and some of the artists and all of that dumb jazz and at one
02:02:28 point munchie asks ben saint how it's possible for anyone to still give a shit about mlp
02:02:35 then oh how is it there's nothing i hate literally possible
02:02:40 incriminating evidence still yeah yeah the proof is in the pudding shit about my little pony
02:02:45 i don't know i don't fucking know may i remind you this is coming from a guy who spent 34 minutes
02:02:54 of his life discussing taco bell with digi bro as if it actually holds any weight and because of that
02:03:01 we're supposed to take this seriously he says that he says that in a way he says that in a
02:03:08 voice that is like he's really got you like he's really caught you in a contradiction here
02:03:15 that that sentence doesn't make sense that does not that is not how you speak it's like
02:03:25 munchie said munchie said that he doesn't understand why people like tuna fish but over here he spent
02:03:38 34 minutes talking about how good salmon is and we're expected to take that seriously like i guess
02:03:47 yeah like okay okay so so we ask this okay okay there's a clip okay what i say is how can anyone
02:03:54 still care about mlp a seven-year-old show with a little to no substance the what's so ever that
02:04:00 we only watch like due to zeitgeist and perceived like lack of options on tv that's the only reason
02:04:05 anyone watched that entire fucking show yeah it sucks it's bad it's horrible it sucks i hate mlp
02:04:12 it's awful no one should watch it sure it's horrible so so so so i dare i dare to question why
02:04:20 anyone watching lp uh a fucking it like a meme a literal meme a literal meme show i i dare to
02:04:29 question what what what value it could have and then and then like he like shits on stealing your dad
02:04:34 as if that literally means anything if that has any bearing whatsoever first listen to your dad is
02:04:41 more like just it like you can call it a food review show when in fact it's just me and digi
02:04:46 making jokes and like the food review is like a backdrop much like almost all of our content is
02:04:50 about the chemistry of the hosts and not the actual subject matter itself that's the point of all of
02:04:56 our content maybe he said no maybe he didn't know that's the point and and you're welcome you're
02:05:00 welcome for me explain to it i mean of course he doesn't know of course of course he doesn't
02:05:06 understand that like listen to him look at him look at him and and and what does me making bad
02:05:13 content and not you know send your dad's the best show ever made but like if it if it was just dog
02:05:17 shit what she doesn't uh what would that do with mlp being bad yeah yeah what would that what would
02:05:23 that have to do yeah it's like it's like it's like like let's see you do better it's like yeah like
02:05:29 like the fact that you did anything that he doesn't think is good means that your opinion about anything
02:05:34 at all is worthless and like should be should be discarded immediately it's not even that i like i
02:05:41 reviewed like it's not that like i reviewed a show that he thought it was bad and he's like oh well
02:05:45 your tastes are just bad it's not like that it's not like i am fucking like like i just don't i can't
02:05:52 review shows correctly or something it's completely different like medium it's like how does my opinion
02:05:59 on food invalidate my opinion on a cartoon you did you did something completely unrelated
02:06:06 that he doesn't see the value in like therefore just like you're wrong about everything yeah
02:06:11 i don't fucking understand i don't understand what his point is or what he's trying to like get
02:06:17 across like he like he obviously think that's that's kind of like a weird but it's kind of like a weird
02:06:22 ad hominem like like the fact that you would do that like the fact that you would do that means
02:06:26 you're stupid and therefore we shouldn't take it seriously or something like like that's what he's
02:06:30 trying to do which is like terrible like even if even if he succeeded at doing that like it would
02:06:35 be shitty and embarrassing that he did but like he didn't even succeed because his point doesn't make
02:06:40 any sense it's it's indescribable it is okay continue they do eventually come across digibro's
02:06:49 page and they don't really say anything bad about him and i suppose that does make sense considering
02:06:55 that ben saint is friends with both friends but not not you though not really out of nowhere
02:07:00 ramble on how much ben saint really hates burning doughnut just because he saw his i was a little
02:07:07 hard on burning yeah he takes his artwork and proceeds to call him an idiot but what exactly
02:07:13 does he mean he literally says nothing about the burning doughnut except for how he sets up his
02:07:19 patreon he doesn't really say anything about the burning i literally self he just i literally
02:07:26 say nothing about the burning doughnut except for like a thing that he did well yeah here let it go
02:07:31 criticize it is what he does on the internet oh and speaking of okay okay okay so he's this this is
02:07:38 like this is what he says all he does is make fun of his patreon he doesn't make any he doesn't make
02:07:45 any points about the burning doughnut himself if he just criticizes the stuff he does online
02:07:51 do you understand the problem with that sentence do you like like like like like the like the stuff
02:07:57 you do online is not real like that's not what some that doesn't represent a person in any
02:08:03 meaningful way he doesn't like that stuff like that stuff is is like like that stuff is like above
02:08:09 criticism okay he doesn't criticize the burning doughnut he just criticizes what he does yeah
02:08:19 what the fuck like like like i mean that's insane that's insane from the get go but like even
02:08:26 overlooking how obviously retarded that idea is there's like you know i could be like well
02:08:31 that's what you're doing to us right now you're criticizing what we did on the internet yeah
02:08:35 you're criticizing a thing we put on the internet
02:08:38 uh are we are we are like the neurons firing are you putting a picture are we painting a picture
02:08:44 of your brain blast i he needs he needs a good brain blaster too he needs to have a brain in the
02:08:51 first place which he obviously doesn't he needs something like okay i i want to harp on this
02:08:59 because it's fucking insane yeah he just i just don't understand how it can be so
02:09:08 blatantly contradictory like and he also have like a script this way this is scripted i'm sure
02:09:14 i'm sure i'm positive yeah so how can you write okay you you think that you think that sentence
02:09:21 you write that sentence you record that sentence you edit that sentence yeah you do all of those
02:09:27 things and you don't catch how it's clearly a contradiction onto itself yeah and that it makes
02:09:35 zero sense he's you are you're you are criticizing the burning donut for the things that he's doing
02:09:42 online the things that he's doing online are making you make judgments based you are judging him
02:09:49 you are judging him based on the things that he does yeah yeah yeah yeah judging him based on his
02:09:53 words and his actions yeah and that's and that's and that's ridiculous like that's a ridiculous thing
02:09:59 to do yeah that's insane it is insane insane it is completely insane that is unbearable
02:10:09 um someone needs to stop him he needs to be fucking stopped right continue okay
02:10:17 patreon get used to ben saint going back to this because he bitches about patreon
02:10:24 like he spends a lot of time complaining about the amount of money that people are making on
02:10:29 patreon despite that he has no reason to do so why would he even want to he's clearly making more
02:10:36 money than at least half of these people so it shouldn't even be phasing him at all is it because
02:10:41 he just doesn't like the idea that these people are getting money for expressing their talents
02:10:46 because that's literally what it looks like while it's not the worst thing that i've seen so far
02:10:52 it definitely makes him look pretentious on pretentious it makes me look pretentious specifically
02:11:00 on a very heart-to-stomach level and from there they just spend a lot of time being complete
02:11:06 hold on pause the video like pause making me making the video yeah yeah yeah
02:11:19 what are we doing what are we doing he's making fun of me for the fucking minecraft thing

02:18:01 the star of david oh my god what the watchful pony wow just that part where they start talking
02:18:14 shit about keyframe i survived lily peat cr and so many other shitbags in this community without
02:18:20 even flinching but this was so scummy that i literally had to pause the video and take a break
02:18:26 i am dead serious serious is misspelled even lily peat wouldn't do something that slimy
02:18:32 you're done fucked up i'm glad this guy gave up on pony because his attitude would have done

02:24:06 We have to get Hippo to download Skype so we can be on.
02:24:10 No, this is good, no this is good, this is what we want.
02:24:17 This is commercial break.
02:24:18 Do you have frog fractures?
02:24:19 Just go to frog fractures and start playing more.
02:24:23 Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
02:24:25 Pretty good.
02:24:27 Pon Luffing Ulysses S. Grant used this political slogan in 1872, take a-
02:24:35 I think it's Grantham No Quarter.
02:24:37 Pretty sure.
02:24:38 Grantham No Quarter, oops, you blew that one, okay, he who cannot lie does not know what
02:24:45 the truth is?
02:24:47 Oh, Otto von Bismarck unified this collection of territories, the German Empire.
02:24:53 Oh no no no no no no.
02:24:55 None of these are right.
02:24:56 You sure it's not the German Empire?
02:24:58 No, definitely, yeah, no, definitely not the German Empire.
02:25:02 Definitely not Bismarck, definitely not Belgium.
02:25:04 I'm fairly certain it's not rugby union, but you can try that it's not the rugby union. I
02:25:10 I know for a fact that it's not any of the other ones. It's the German Empire's what they had after he did that
02:25:16 Yeah, yeah, because because he unified them. He made them by unifying these collection of territories
02:25:21 It's not like what is it called after he unified those territories like I think it is I think the difference is academic
02:25:27 I'm pretty sure that like he unified a region that then became the German Empire. I'm going with German Empire. Oh
02:25:33 Look at that. Oh, look at that. Look who knows a finger. I was I know I know my shit. They were just gay
02:25:39 Everyone had a hip-hop to the call
02:25:41 Okay, women. Is he gonna is he recording? Yeah, I think so women in the garden is a painting by I
02:25:49 Don't know I'm gonna look it up
02:25:53 For somebody that can't see his name on here
02:25:56 What's this is it given? Oh, it's a given. Okay. It's Claude Monet
02:26:02 The phrase gas pipes
02:26:10 Hello hippo
02:26:15 My god
02:26:18 Is he here? I don't hear anything wait what is that him? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're really quiet. What what?
02:26:27 You're on can you hear us? Yeah, but are you recording?
02:26:32 No, okay. Okay, you're you're on from fractions to because I didn't want to explain to you
02:26:36 And then we would have downtime and I have to explain to you on fact for our actions, too
02:26:40 So here's what you do. I'm gonna give you the file right now for Minecraft. Oh
02:26:47 Okay
02:26:51 Very confused. No, it's fine. This is good though
02:26:55 This is so the pincers are unique among glasses and I
02:27:02 All right. Meanwhile, this is we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna have downtime, right?
02:27:08 All right, so what you're gonna do is well while you're doing this you're gonna want to you are on Windows 7, right?
02:27:14 Yep
02:27:15 No, no hippo hippo. I am. Yes. Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, sorry
02:27:20 That was been first because I can't I can't tell go go to and like I go to like open up like the start menu and type in I
02:27:28 P
02:27:30 C O
02:27:32 in
02:27:33 F I
02:27:35 G IP config
02:27:38 The temperance fountain is a good. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You want to you're gonna want to see MD Edward
02:27:44 And then you're gonna do I
02:27:48 In what's your type and see you type in cmd.exe
02:27:51 Okay
02:27:53 All right
02:27:54 I'm looking at
02:27:56 Okay, okay. Now now you're gonna want to look at for IPv4 address
02:28:02 All right, I got that. Is this streaming by the way, you shouldn't be streaming this. I don't think
02:28:08 Okay, it's fine
02:28:10 Then type in that address you see into your like your like browser. You're like internet browser. All right
02:28:16 well, I can't stream that but
02:28:18 Yeah, I know I'll just I'll just turn it off. It'll be the be the this will be part of the frog fractions
02:28:23 So we're being streamed right now, right? Like like like this part of frog fractions will be on the street, right? Yeah
02:28:29 Yeah, okay, good. Nice. All right, so I type that into
02:28:34 Hey, just a little preview
02:28:35 I had to play mess that too so we could advance and fraud fractions too in this of YouTube video
02:28:40 This YouTube video will be the best YouTube video ever made
02:28:45 So here I am like these questions are like the hardest they're so hard
02:28:53 Okay, okay. So so it's it's in there and when when you open that up
02:28:58 IPv4 address I type that into my browser. Yeah, and then like it didn't happen. It didn't work
02:29:04 I don't know. Maybe a rarity. Yeah
02:29:07 Donald Denny became widely known for his I got there's so many different IPv4 addresses
02:29:13 Okay, be I IPv4
02:29:16 V4 a Scottish strong man. Okay
02:29:20 So so you typed in oh, wait. No, this I'm just I come in the lowest one
02:29:25 They come as a boon and a blessing to you know what you might actually want to use might you want to use default gateway?
02:29:31 I'm just trying something else
02:29:36 That didn't work
02:29:38 No, you know what you hear here go to the IP config thing like that like window and then try and type into your browser
02:29:49 What is an effective treatment for hysterectomy
02:29:52 Not not like the words default gateway as in like those numbers and then yeah, yeah for hysteria
02:29:57 You should get like a brink screen that says what's your password you?
02:30:01 Yes, yes, I did it
02:30:03 What at least that's how it is for netgear. What do you have? What's your what's your router?
02:30:08 BT oh, I got I got a thing saying BT. Oh
02:30:13 Oh, it says that doesn't ask for a username or password. I
02:30:17 Don't think so. Okay, so you're just in there like try and look around
02:30:21 It'll probably like it'd be an advanced advanced saying somewhere something like that find a place. It says port forwarding
02:30:28 I
02:30:30 Might be in like a few for me for me in netgear. It's
02:30:35 Advanced then advanced setup then port forwarding slash port triggering. That's what it is for me
02:30:41 But it might look probably different Pico
02:30:43 This is this is fucked. This is
02:30:47 The fact that you're trying to explain that in a tutorial to the I just want to play Minecraft with my friends
02:30:52 You couldn't turn the server on. I mean, it's funny
02:30:55 I mean, I mean, I couldn't do that because like I like I actually like reset like my server
02:31:00 Like I would have just done that but my like my like the world is fine
02:31:04 But the actual like server itself doesn't have like the right like like settings in it
02:31:09 Which I guess I could do right now and it actually be really easy. So I guess let's do that
02:31:14 But wait stay here in case it doesn't work all right
02:31:18 You can also you can just stay here if you want to get Nate on here
02:31:22 You could just stream minecraft and then the Minecraft stream will be in frog practice to that would be pretty funny
02:31:29 Oh
02:31:30 Hey, by the way, what do you think about far corrections to just so you have that on like record?
02:31:34 So when Santa reporting can see this video and then he'll be like, oh my god, he likes it
02:31:40 What do I think about for impressions to I know no no for corrections one like the video like our video
02:31:45 I think I talked about it in my own stream and he's seen that because he followed my my my YouTube for that
02:31:53 So he knows, you know
02:31:55 He knows whatever it was I said
02:31:58 Yeah
02:32:00 Make sure I'll find
02:32:04 All right, I hope you fucking god. Oh, yeah, I'm trying to do three
02:32:09 online mode
02:32:16 Fuck fuck Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, yeah by the way, I got really mad at you earlier like I was like
02:32:23 I'm gonna kill hippo
02:32:25 Why did I get mad at you and you were like that? I didn't do anything wrong. Yeah
02:32:30 Yeah
02:32:32 It's fine though. We're best friends. I'll never not be I'm gonna kill Nate still though
02:32:38 All right, all right here here, let me try this try trying it's it's gonna it's gonna be like loading
02:32:43 It's like try it in a second
02:32:46 Yeah, sir, all right, I'll tell you when you like start
02:32:53 All right, yeah, try now try now. All right the turning on game capture
02:32:59 Join server

02:33:09 Get the fuck out of oh, right. All right later. Oh, I'll be a fun shrieking. What? Okay?
02:33:22 Imagine what's gonna be like he's gonna like watch this video and then he's gonna be like, oh my god
02:33:25 That was me like from a while ago
02:33:30 It's gonna be crazy Nate, I mean Ben are you there wait? Oh, did he leave? Yeah. Yeah, I've been I've been playing frog fractions
02:33:38 We gotta you bet we gotta do the show. Oh, yeah. Yeah, right um
02:33:43 Okay, done
02:33:46 Let me just turn the let me just turn the fucking volume off on the on the frog fractions

02:34:00 I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm
02:34:02 Ms. Anthropony. All right, here we go more
02:34:08 After Wolf they rip into doing critics saying that he didn't go for me
02:34:12 I didn't go for me. Oh the video started with him saying fucking assholes. No, here here here. Here. Let me refresh the page, okay?
02:34:23 My dog wants me to go. Yeah, it's restarting the entire fucking thing. God damn it. I'm at like eight minutes
02:34:33 You're what I'm at eight eight minutes and four seconds
02:34:37 five
02:34:39 seven seven
02:34:41 Get used to playing for you now. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Okay. Yeah a lot Josh scorcher
02:34:47 Mr. I love her
02:34:49 Munchkin FNGR lightning bliss Rosie severe sweet. What that's seriously you went after Rosie severe
02:34:56 What the fuck was she gonna do to you? Oh?
02:34:59 How could we how could we go after the I don't even have a
02:35:02 Rosie severe
02:35:04 Cuz he's a kid
02:35:05 Like I'm not blaming him
02:35:07 I'm not blaming him for being terrible and being useless and for him being worthless and for his content being shit
02:35:14 I'm not blaming him for any of that then why the fuck are you wasting your time?
02:35:20 criticizing him
02:35:21 See the thing about wooden wooden sword is like I went to his channel later and I watched his videos and like well
02:35:26 I didn't think they were good. I thought they were perfectly like fine
02:35:29 They were they were just like bog standard like you know goofy YouTube yeah, and I was like well
02:35:34 I mean, yeah, like there's worse people
02:35:37 There's it's still shit cuz it's pony shit cuz he's making pony reviews, you know, there's inherently bad
02:35:44 Yeah, what he's doing isn't there like brute force like with yeah, yeah, yeah, it's an uphill battle
02:35:52 Now I understand there are a lot of people who like and dislike these analysts for different reasons
02:35:58 But the way that Ben saint is doing it
02:36:01 He really doesn't give us a lot to work with like the way that he just kind of slurs on his sentences
02:36:08 As he talks about these people really makes it seem like he doesn't know much about them at all
02:36:13 Which right from the bat doesn't make him very resourceful for this
02:36:18 criticizing a speech impediment which I don't even have yeah and like
02:36:24 like like I
02:36:26 Just I just can't understand like we know these people it's especially you like I know of these people
02:36:33 But you've taught these people like yeah, you know you know them
02:36:37 Yeah, you are like like where the fuck does missanthropony get off telling me that I don't know what I'm talking about like yeah
02:36:44 I have I have like personally interacted with these people before
02:36:47 It's disgusting like it's really disgusting that he thought he had any fucking grounds to say any
02:36:53 He's making money you're not anything what in fact he is the one who knows absolutely nothing about the video
02:36:58 He's watching he just does not understand a single fucking thing about the appeal or the draw of it or even what the video is
02:37:05 He just does not understand. He's not understand. He really really
02:37:12 Is just like he's just literally retarded. Let's just let's just put it right out there like he's actually retarded and there's something wrong with him
02:37:19 He just he just is not smart. He just is not a smart man
02:37:22 No, oh, and they also not perceptive
02:37:25 Mr. Enter doesn't have a Pony OC despite that. He actually did have a pony. Oh heaven forbid on a video
02:37:32 I really fucked up. It was also just on a thumbnail and yeah, I was just really starting to get bored
02:37:40 Like I can't say that I'm getting upset with this video. It doesn't piss me off. It's just so boring
02:37:47 It's just I don't make an example. I don't make this video entertaining
02:37:50 So they start talking about Vita and at some point they go to his channel
02:37:57 Oh, he's got oh, he's got a little fucking video of him with the key frame key frame and puzzle
02:38:02 Oh key frame fucking key frame. Oh great. This stick is gonna start talking about key frame. I wonder how this is gonna go
02:38:10 Let's let's fucking talk about key. Why did he bother making that?
02:38:13 Oh
02:38:26 Way to show us how you're willing to look down on people then personally criticizing key frame and mocking her patreon
02:38:33 I seriously cannot figure out how I like it any worse from there. Why? Why is that?
02:38:40 Yeah, yeah, yeah like
02:38:42 like
02:38:44 Like just like just like with burning doughnut. He's like it's like I've incriminated myself by criticizing the wrong aspect of a person
02:38:53 And also not only that which we've already explained how that is making sense
02:38:58 Like why why now? Why not any of the other like like he's just mentioned by name the brain
02:39:03 Like he's been he mentioned like them in like like a list like oh, I look impossible
02:39:07 I don't fucking doctor will but he didn't go in like like this is like he goes in like oh my god
02:39:12 He's talking about this about key frame. Like why is this any worse than you know the other people?
02:39:18 You know why it's because it's because he had some personal thing
02:39:21 He had some like personal connection to key for it because someone told him because someone told him
02:39:26 It was a big deal and shouldn't be joked about you know
02:39:29 It just goes to show that he just doesn't like he like he doesn't actually care about these like the things that we're saying
02:39:37 He just cares that he like like he wasn't told they supposed to care when we make fun about Kim possible or about Dr. Wolf
02:39:44 We're not he wasn't he wasn't like informed that's bad as well
02:39:47 He only knows that it's bad. He's we're talking about key frame and that specific instance
02:39:51 I think that even worse. I think that probably like
02:39:55 Like Miss Anthropony gets mad and indignant when someone else does something that like he has done and been scolded for
02:40:03 like
02:40:04 He like he gets upset about about like his path like the fact that he was mean to lethal or a mage and stuff
02:40:10 Like I think that maybe like maybe like he was mean to key frame and someone told him like dude
02:40:15 That's not cool because this is serious and now he's like oh now
02:40:19 He knows like this is serious and if anyone else does it I'm gonna fucking step in and be like, you know
02:40:25 Justice, you know, yeah, like that's that's my that's my headcanon at least
02:40:29 Yeah, is that he's just like like he's been scolded for this before so he's like I made them
02:40:34 I learned from my mistakes because later on in the video
02:40:37 He does go into bit like like I learned from my mistakes, but these guys didn't
02:40:42 Yeah, fucker. I'm here
02:40:45 She comes in she's there for like a week
02:40:48 She makes like one video and then and then on with the waterworks on with the fucking
02:40:53 Oh, no, suddenly. I'm really poor and I'm getting and my family is abusing me and and oh, no
02:40:59 My life is ruined. Oh somebody help me and then they do and then the fucking doesn't people pledge to her patreon
02:41:06 Get her like I don't know like a hundred bucks a month or something and probably they fucking give her money to like
02:41:12 I don't know she's got a bunch of money and now she's been for a while
02:41:15 For a while there fucking key frame was making more than on patreon than me and it fucking ate at me
02:41:22 Thank God
02:41:24 Yeah
02:41:28 You know that's
02:41:30 That that's a thing that's a thing that Josh Scorcher used to do like he would
02:41:34 He would quote unquote not swear like he wouldn't call you an asshole
02:41:38 He would call you an a apostrophe apostrophe hole like like it like it's any better
02:41:44 Yeah, like he's not just like he's not just calling at you
02:41:48 But like with like them the moral high ground of like oh, but I didn't actually say it. That's bizarre like yeah
02:41:54 Like I was gonna call him the C word
02:41:57 Okay, so we know that you wanted to call him a cunt. How does that that has why didn't you just say it?
02:42:03 Yeah, why like you don't have any reason to not say it. It's one like
02:42:09 That would have just been better because it means you're not a fucking weird coward was weird such a weird coward
02:42:15 Like he's misanthropony is such a coward. It's amazing. He's just like slimy and gross and untrustworthy and just completely
02:42:22 He just doesn't have any values or morals whatsoever
02:42:26 Only those have been like only only those worlds which have been just imposed upon him
02:42:31 And he doesn't understand whatsoever and are completely impersonal and he just he just follows like oh, I'm not supposed to swear for no reason
02:42:39 Yeah, just yeah, he doesn't have any he doesn't have any like critical thinking or like higher level like like meta like meta
02:42:45 Thinking skills like he doesn't have any like he doesn't have any like ethical like principles that he follows
02:42:50 He just has like rules that he's like learned rules that other people have told him. That's that's my takeaway
02:42:57 All right, he clearly knows that the keyframe movement was a thing and yet
02:43:03 He's talking about it like it was just a complete scam despite all the evidence pointing out that it's not bro
02:43:11 Yeah, I can understand your detachment from the brony fandom in recent years
02:43:15 But you are really starting to trend on show me show me any evidence
02:43:20 Like like he's claiming there's evidence, but he doesn't give any of it. Yeah in the comments in the comments
02:43:25 I think he was like, oh, I wouldn't I don't want to give any evidence because I don't want to like divulge keyframes personal
02:43:31 Shit and well, no, how am I supposed to see?
02:43:36 Well, I guess I'll just take your word for it then
02:43:39 No, faggot
02:43:43 This is another person who like
02:43:46 Like keyframe because she had like a sad tear jerky like oh, I feel so bad for myself fucking
02:43:54 Moment with dr. Wolf. I'm pretty sure this person got like I don't know some fucking money out of it too or something
02:44:03 Play that again
02:44:05 Like keyframe because she had like a sad tear jerky like oh, I feel so bad for myself fucking
02:44:12 Moment with dr. Wolf. I'm pretty sure this person got like I don't know some fucking money out of it too or something
02:44:19 He's so mad
02:44:20 Okay, it was bad enough for you to muck that situation once but twice you seriously had to go back to it twice
02:44:29 Why wasn't he this mad the first time? Yeah?
02:44:32 Like like like okay, it's like if it's so bad
02:44:36 Why did it take me doing it twice to really make a mess? Yeah, like I
02:44:42 Just just another weird rule
02:44:44 I guess just like it sounds like something bad like or like so horribly bad just once and it's fine
02:44:50 But if they but if they say it again
02:44:53 Then then you know they really mean it and then you then it's okay to criticize
02:44:58 Yeah, no, I was going to do some kind of over-the-top yelling or some kind of really angry facial
02:45:06 Oh, is it coming to show you how is it about to happen? I am with you right now, but there are no words
02:45:13 There are no facial expressions that could possibly
02:45:16 Capture how pissed off I am right now the only thing that could possibly and appropriately
02:45:22 Represent how pissed off I am right now is this one clip from injustice gods among us
02:45:53 Forget the doctor video. I don't even know I don't even know what to say about that. I
02:46:01 Don't even know
02:46:03 Ben it's just it's just a mate like like he's like how
02:46:07 How can I like how can I put like the biggest fucking exclamation point on like what I'm saying here?
02:46:13 Like how can I really can like the like the most the strongest
02:46:17 Convance of the the feeling that I have like what is what is the most heartfelt sincere
02:46:22 expression of this feeling
02:46:25 Okay, I want you to really really ponder. I want you to ponder and think and reflect. Yeah, okay
02:46:33 So he says that he could like make a big stink about it
02:46:37 Like, you know like like I guess he has some sufferers where he knows that it's like out place
02:46:42 We want to really emphasize it
02:46:43 But the only way he like it comes off is the only way he knows how to express himself is by just
02:46:49 Using a clip from a video game like yeah, that's exactly those sort of terms
02:46:55 We're like like he wants to like what what video game moment made him feel this like he made him like think about
02:47:04 How angry something is that one thing from justice gods among us like I that just feels so
02:47:10 Low functioning, you know, yeah, it feels like he saw that scene and just was impressed by like the anger on display
02:47:19 And like never forgot it. Yeah, I was like really really impressed by it and like
02:47:24 Was and so when he thought like I'm angry. How can I explain? I remember the time Superman was really angry
02:47:32 Here here we go
02:47:35 Just he can't express himself
02:47:40 Doesn't know how he doesn't know how to act or think or feel no, I mean this is like I
02:47:48 Mean I we watched a couple of his other like reaction videos
02:47:51 Like we watched through the video or where he like reacts to like the the the MLP movie trailer and how he like
02:47:57 Started giggling like just like when Pinkie Pie appeared on screen like just Pinkie Pie showing up and being seen he just started like
02:48:05 He just started giggling like a girl like a little girl
02:48:08 And it's like this is the kind of person that we're dealing with like he just
02:48:14 He's very enthralled by media of all kinds and yeah, he that's how he chooses to communicate
02:48:22 Yeah, yeah, like like very low functioning very low
02:48:26 Missing throw a pony could he would talk exclusively like mule and from Homestuck in just Tumblr gifts
02:48:33 That's how his ideal communication would work. I imagine yeah, like no words
02:48:38 Just move like like just moments from movies strung together to make a sentence
02:48:48 Yeah, I just hate him I just hate how he looks like oh, yeah, I just hate his OC
02:48:53 Let's talk about how shitty his OC is for a second. Okay, it's just really bad
02:48:57 It's like it's really bad like it's just Pinkie, but like bad
02:49:01 It's like I just I hate how it's but his OC is a rip-off, you know, I can't I can't fucking stand that
02:49:08 Anyway, that's that's kind of a side of the point not not everyone can have like be like an artist and like make a good OC
02:49:15 I guess I get that. Yeah, well, even though I think the art of making an OC is disgusting
02:49:20 However, I understand that for some reason you may want to do it. Yeah. Yeah, there are reasons
02:49:27 This is one of the worst OCs I've ever seen this I actually think you know, I actually think
02:49:34 Miss Anthroponies OC is like really close to tune critics in terms of like my least favorite pony OCs
02:49:40 Like if they're both like in the extreme leagues
02:49:43 Yeah, like like like like it's just the red
02:49:47 It's just the red because he knows it like red looks cool because it's like evil. It's like yeah
02:49:52 It's like it's like an evil color. So I'm gonna use a red because I'm like I'm like I'm like morally gray
02:49:58 I'm like, you know, I consider myself the least gay
02:50:04 It's just like he took he took sad pinky pie and then just like tweaked it in ways that made it so much worse
02:50:11 And was like done. I'm satisfied with this
02:50:15 What is that key mark by the way? What is that? I don't I don't know
02:50:20 Like is it supposed to be like comedy and tragedy because like it's not he's this isn't comedy. This is only tragedy
02:50:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know man. I don't know what it's supposed to be
02:50:31 I guess it probably means something real retarded. And you just have to ask
02:50:35 Like an angel of death. He's like a death merchant. He's gonna like you like like pop a cap in your ass
02:50:40 But like not ask like like a asterisk asterisk because he can't yeah, his mom is on the phone
02:50:46 Yeah
02:50:48 When I when I said that for did I say apostrophe when I meant? Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. Well, excuse me
02:50:54 Fuck me F F apostrophe CK me
02:50:59 Mm-hmm
02:51:00 God you want to keep going? Yeah. Yeah, so bad
02:51:04 The key frame movement happened two years ago
02:51:07 And that's not including the ten years prior where she was struggling to not get killed by her mother or worse
02:51:14 The only reason she's still alive is because by some miracle her shitty father is a slightly
02:51:23 Less shitty person if you still think that any of us were making this up while it was happening
02:51:29 I still have that video that was uploaded on DeWelstonators channel saved onto a flash drive in my room
02:51:37 Before it was put as unlisted or private
02:51:40 I can mail it to you whenever I can provide it that I have permission from key frame or wants to mail me a video
02:51:48 He wants to mail me a video as proof of
02:51:52 Something like I'm just really unconvinced like yeah, maybe that like maybe there is a real
02:51:58 Maybe there is a real problem here that like I don't know about but like he's really not convincing me like it's like
02:52:05 He keeps alluding in fact out there
02:52:08 It's just so plainly and like like just get just everyone was about key frame when in fact I okay first of all
02:52:15 I don't know about key frame. I don't even know who key frame is so I don't know anything about that
02:52:19 But I'm assuming I'm assuming that it's not that easy to find out information of this because you aren't providing any evidence
02:52:26 What so ever you're just saying that you do have
02:52:29 Yeah, yeah, there's secret information that he alone has yeah
02:52:33 That explain how this isn't a scam
02:52:37 Yeah, like I never even said it was a scam
02:52:40 I just said that like she just like people gave her a bunch of like pity money and like
02:52:45 Now and now she's hot shit even though there's nothing special about her
02:52:48 Like that's all I was saying which is true, and I'm not gonna walk that back ever
02:52:53 and
02:52:55 Yeah, what does he want? He just just the way just the way that they allude like oh, it's so bad. Oh, it's so it's like
02:53:02 Is anything that bad like the way you talk about it? It's like it was the second fucking Holocaust, you know like like
02:53:09 Don't fucking don't fucking sit here and tell me oh, it's so bad
02:53:13 I'm not gonna tell you how bad it was, but just trust me. It was that bad
02:53:16 Yeah, just just leave trust me leave me alone, you know shut up. No, I don't trust I don't trust you like like he like
02:53:26 Okay, first of all
02:53:27 There's no like like there's no like way to gauge that so like like he obviously just like like got caught up in the zeitgeist
02:53:35 Like with watching my little pony. He was just like he just he probably just heard some things
02:53:40 They're like yeah, like he frame has some bad parents and I got telephoned and then and then he just just believes things
02:53:46 I mean, you know, I don't I don't know. I don't know what I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah, I don't know
02:53:51 I don't know what the truth is, but I do know tell us
02:53:56 Yeah, and I and I am sure
02:53:58 And I am sure that that Miss Anthropony believes things uncritically
02:54:04 So like I'm not even if he told me the story like I wouldn't believe it like I would need someone who's not stupid to tell me
02:54:10 Yeah, I
02:54:12 Want to know I mean, you know, I don't really want to make fun of someone but like for no reason
02:54:18 But it just seems it like he just will not he just won't tell us
02:54:23 He won't like here's like the like the you the fucking link to the YouTube is where it
02:54:28 Proves all this stuff is happening and like he like explains the story about like I don't even know what it
02:54:33 I don't know what the keyframe situation is. I assume it's something like parental abuse. I don't know
02:54:40 happening and
02:54:42 And Miss Anthropony is not forthcoming with the details. So
02:54:48 It's not I think we've done our due diligence. Yeah
02:54:51 I'm gonna fuck around here. Okay. I am just not this is a very very very very very
02:55:00 Very touchy topic to this day. I still have a hard time looking back to it and I'm
02:55:07 he
02:55:08 He is traumatized
02:55:10 by the keyframe situation
02:55:13 situation that
02:55:14 Probably didn't happen to him. No happened to keyframe
02:55:19 He's trying he's not talking about something that like happened
02:55:22 He's he's traumatized by someone else's problem and it's bad that we're triggering him
02:55:29 He has nightmares about it. Like like he is really held up on the fact that he knows he know he he
02:55:37 I don't get the I don't get the feel that he was like
02:55:41 Like I'm assuming do the fact that I've like seen some stuff like this where it's like there was like some like task force of like
02:55:48 Kickstart or something assuming is happening. I'm assuming that this is all assumption because again, I don't know and he won't tell us
02:55:55 I'm assuming that he just kind of like saw the kickstarter and like saw that things were going down that people were trying to help
02:56:03 I think he like talked to friends of hers or something. Yeah, that's I think he's friends with her boyfriend
02:56:09 and
02:56:11 So he's upset that he knows about something bad that happened
02:56:16 Yeah, and that's the extent of his involvement with it. Yeah, he just he heard about it
02:56:20 Yeah, you heard about it sure that a lot of people have a hard time looking back to it, too
02:56:25 Because it was that bad the heart. Oh my god
02:56:30 Struggling to keep my mind together
02:56:33 listening to all of those horrifying stories and
02:56:37 His his trauma of hearing the horrifying stories. Yeah, I
02:56:45 Don't I don't I mean it all right
02:56:51 Yeah, he's so empathetic that like he he felt it even more acutely than keyframe herself
02:56:56 Yeah, he was the real victim. So so that proves that it's so bad
02:57:00 But yeah, because he felt bad because he heard stories that proves that key
02:57:07 That's just how serious this is and how we shouldn't be fucking with it. Yeah
02:57:11 Do you get off claiming that her situation was a stunt to gain popularity I didn't
02:57:18 Using it as an excuse to bitch. I just think it was milked again
02:57:22 Now I will admit that I really wasn't that much of a better person when I started out
02:57:27 I was being really really horrible
02:57:31 Judging people despite that. I really didn't know anything about them because of some fleeting assumption
02:57:37 That influence yeah, yeah
02:57:39 To this day, it really means a lot to me that after I was given another chance
02:57:45 I was able to train myself to know and he made such he made so much good out of that extra chance
02:57:51 She was given knowing like look what he's done was wrong for me to assume that lethal Aurora mage or golden fox
02:57:58 Or Tommy Oliver were a bad influence because I only looked at their content through a one
02:58:05 Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't know what he's talking about again
02:58:10 I know that I know that he was a dick to lethal or a mage, but that's like the ex why do I keep calling her lethal?
02:58:16 I know that he was a dick to mage. I don't know the details. Okay, but I want to harp on here
02:58:22 It's like that he got mad at them for being a bad influence. Yeah a bad
02:58:29 Influence I cannot imagine
02:58:32 Anyone thinking that about mage like Tommy like I know people have they had their divisive opinion like some people didn't like Tommy
02:58:40 He was because for whatever but mage
02:58:44 Who okay, who would think that sure you're but you're taking that criticism at face value, but you're like thinking
02:58:51 Okay, yeah, how are they bad influence? Yeah a bad influence though
02:58:56 Oh, yeah, like is a problem like the fact that he is upset that someone may be a bad influence
02:59:02 Oh, my little pony brony analysis community
02:59:08 Like that that's even on the list of crimes that someone can be guilty of exactly. Yeah. Yeah possible
02:59:15 because they're making fucking YouTube videos about analysis of my little pony they
02:59:23 How who are they influencing who are they too bad influence?
02:59:29 Anyone how could they bad influence anyone? I wonder if he means there are bad influence within the community or like to people watching
02:59:37 You know like which like what specifically is the grievance here? I am I am honestly curious like what the fuck
02:59:43 Any of this could have possibly been about what does it mean? How could we?
02:59:50 like okay, okay
02:59:52 How could like yeah, okay, Tom like mage obviously did nothing wrong and there's nothing
02:59:58 Even viable there to talk about Tom
03:00:02 What did he do that could even be construed as a bad influence like like he'd be broke honestly and them
03:00:10 But a bad influence on leaving the fandom leaving the fandom on bad terms
03:00:16 And I but I think it was before that like I think I think it was before Tom left
03:00:22 And before that I think the only thing is like
03:00:25 criticizing the show and maybe being a little hard on like Brony culture
03:00:29 being like bad
03:00:31 Influence not being a bad person not being a bad person not being mean or like not any of those criticisms being a bad
03:00:41 Influence on people you are badly influencing someone. How?
03:00:47 What does that mean Tommy never had this video that was like guys you should do this guys this is this is how you should act
03:00:57 What does it mean
03:01:01 I knew I wish I knew I wish I could get a little window
03:01:05 Into the mind of like you know just like a fucking insect like this, you know
03:01:11 Just a small little you know aside leaving the fandom
03:01:17 That doesn't exist. That is not a real thing that someone can do leaving fandom is a useless term
03:01:23 Yeah, I agree because you don't but it's real but it's real to him. It's real that like no one in
03:01:30 No one not a single person
03:01:33 Wakes up one day and says you know what I've had it
03:01:37 I'm not going to enjoy my little pony anymore. I'm just I'm you know
03:01:42 I just I just I just decided I will not partake in my little pony. I'm over. I'm going to leave the fandom
03:01:49 It's going to be over. I will I will not it's like people who leave the fandom quote-unquote
03:01:54 Just don't just kind of like I like oh well, you know, you know after a while I've kind of done all I can do
03:02:00 I don't I'm not really feeling anymore. I'll just make some other stuff. It's not like you're not like leaving it
03:02:05 You're not like leaving behind an interest
03:02:07 You are just deciding on like a moment to my moment basis
03:02:10 Maybe maybe I don't really like feel that strongly about this anymore. Maybe I don't have anything to say
03:02:14 That's all you're doing. You're not like making a point to leave the fandom
03:02:18 That's people the people like this like they see it as like a fucking lifestyle that has to be like actively maintained
03:02:24 And simply an interest
03:02:26 Yeah, yeah, like like it's like their personal little garden and it has to be like cultivated
03:02:30 You know and it has to be cold like like like malignant influences need to be cold from it because it's important
03:02:36 Because it's important and it needs to be kept pure like like the good like the good vibes have to be maintained
03:02:42 And like it has to be it has to make continue to be like like, you know, what it always has been to them
03:02:49 Bronies the burning community you ask beauty and my little point itself is inherently insidious
03:02:55 Yes purified bronies are definitely it needs to be purified from these people we need to save it from these people
03:03:03 Yeah, it needs it needs to be saved from like its most ardent members. Yeah, you are the bad influence
03:03:10 You are the bad influence
03:03:14 People may think that this is okay to do
03:03:17 Like Miss Anthropony and FNG are are like terrible and like the fact that people listen to them is like horrifying
03:03:25 They are actually the bad influence. They are influence. They're influencing the youth
03:03:29 I think that it's okay to communicate such as like this
03:03:32 Yeah, like it's because of people it's because of people like Miss Anthropony and FNG are and like and dr. Wolf and Kim possible
03:03:38 I'd that like a fucking, you know a modestly talented youngster like wooden sword
03:03:44 Who can like can make a fucking YouTube video and have it not be terrible gets fucking on this track of like
03:03:50 Why don't I make fucking pony videos? I don't know man
03:03:53 I'm not saying like I'm not saying it's like he's like he's he's done for but like yeah, that's not good
03:03:59 That's not a good thing to be doing. Yeah, I don't think so
03:04:03 It's definitely it's corrosive and the reason why the reason why I don't think it's good
03:04:08 Is because it means coming into contact with people like this and like having to fucking deal with people like this and risking fucking
03:04:14 Being influenced by people like this
03:04:17 If there were just
03:04:18 P-baps if there were just digipros if there were just fucking give-and-takes then it would be fine
03:04:24 But do the fact that these are the these are the people who are in the community
03:04:29 But like the community now is like the community now is like Lily Pete
03:04:33 Which like fucking kill me fucking like put a bullet in my fucking head. Yeah that I even said that name
03:04:40 That I know who that is the saddest thing that's ever happened to me
03:04:43 These the kind of people who are you in social, but this is this is not an admirable situation
03:04:49 This is what's left like that's what's left
03:04:51 Like it's them and the people that think it's so important that they deserve money to keep doing what they're doing to like carry the fucking torch
03:04:58 and keep it alive
03:05:01 Disgusting absolutely fucking revolting it is like that is awful
03:05:06 Like it was bad enough like when like when we stopped doing it like it was getting bad, but like
03:05:12 The fact that it continued beyond that point and only continued to go in that direction is just really scary
03:05:19 Yeah, it's like how long can they keep this up forever? Yeah forever like show runs
03:05:25 What like what's been left like like this like the cicada like like the cicada of the fan base has like
03:05:31 Crawled out of its hideous shell and it's left like it's dead husk lying there
03:05:36 And like the people that make up the husk will never leave it and it will continue to be important to them
03:05:41 Even though it's empty and even though it's dead
03:05:44 And they'll just be like we we just got we've just got to like keep going through the motions because this is what's important
03:05:49 And and okay, it's obvious that they have no
03:05:53 Grasp of quality none of them do because there's no like just the fact
03:05:59 Yeah, yeah, but like it doesn't matter what it is just like because this institution is important to them like anyone
03:06:05 Who contributes to it is like important and validating like they need that they need to be validated and anyone will do
03:06:13 It doesn't matter who it only matters that you are making a video
03:06:17 That's the only thing that matters and they will be associated with you. Yeah, they are
03:06:23 it's
03:06:24 it's
03:06:25 They're corrupting people that they're corrupt really corrupted insidious and scary
03:06:30 They could be talented, but they are they are forced into this
03:06:33 They like like once they come to contact with it
03:06:36 They are now like associated with this community and that community will reach out to it and it will be enticing
03:06:41 It will be very enticing you will have a lot of people if it seems important and just and good
03:06:46 So you get in here and you realize that everyone's complacent and none of them make any content whatsoever that could be
03:06:52 Even described as good on any level and they love it that way
03:06:56 That is what they are aspiring to they are inspired in my mediocrity
03:07:00 Nothing they do will ever be good and that's just the way they like it. That's just the way the fans like it too
03:07:07 Yeah, yeah, yeah, they want they like that. They're comfortable with the status quo
03:07:11 Like something new would be would be scary something something new would be like well
03:07:16 That's not what we're here for something new would be uninteresting
03:07:20 Like that that was that was new that had different parts to it and that was yeah interesting
03:07:25 Yeah, miss anthra pony miss anthra pony didn't find it to be presented in an interesting way
03:07:31 What's what's interesting about the thousands of clones of each other? What's interesting about that?
03:07:36 What's interesting about the exact same fucking video being presented by a myriad of the same
03:07:42 Score out of character archetypes over and over again in the exact same visual way
03:07:47 What's interesting about that?
03:07:49 I just worry I just worry about I worry about the wooden swords of the world who are like
03:07:54 Fucking caught up caught who like stumble upon this thing and receive like praise and validation for what they're doing
03:08:02 And like, you know
03:08:03 I'm worried. I'm worried about new people getting caught up in this and getting tricked getting fucking tricked
03:08:09 It really is like a weird cult like mentality. It's despicable
03:08:14 Is despicable
03:08:16 Should we continue continue but I will say that I have learned some things since then and one of those things
03:08:22 Is actually knowing when someone is being a piece of crap
03:08:26 Not just because they have an opinion that you don't want to hear
03:08:30 But because they're presenting themselves as an insufferable douchebag in other words
03:08:36 What I'm trying to say is you are a shit
03:08:39 Sucking a bitch Ben. You think you're so cool with your hole
03:08:43 You're a bitch because you don't watch our podcast of us talking about how you're a bitch because you don't want
03:08:50 When did I ever say that?
03:08:51 When did I ever say that like people that don't watch the rowdy fuckers cop killers of bitches?
03:08:55 I mean they are but when in the video did I say that?
03:08:58 What?
03:09:01 Question mark. What's he talking about? What's he talking about?
03:09:06 You
03:09:09 You're a bitch because you don't watch our podcast. I mean that's true. Yeah, it is true, but I didn't but
03:09:16 Like it's like like is that my thing like is that my thing now?
03:09:20 That's not what the podcast. That's not what that video was about. It's just a fact. That's an objective fact
03:09:27 But like that's not what it was about. That's not
03:09:29 That's not even the reason you're upset like yeah, like are you you're suddenly mad because
03:09:36 You think that I think you're dumb because you didn't like the video?
03:09:40 Like is that why when did that become what this is about miss antherpony?
03:09:44 Why when and why this fucking picture you made this picture?
03:09:50 This is what you were talking. This is what you were talking about like he just needs he needs to communicate through like scenes from tv shows. Yeah
03:09:57 you
03:09:59 You thought this was
03:10:01 Okay, I don't know the scene from he thought that maybe it has some sort of like
03:10:06 I
03:10:08 I mean, I'm pretty sure
03:10:11 I mean bobby
03:10:14 I don't know. I'm not entirely sure what's going on in the scene either, but like
03:10:18 I don't think what's happening here is that like bobby is like
03:10:23 Righteously kicking hank in the nuts because hank was like legitimately in the wrong
03:10:27 Like I do not believe for a second that that is what is happening
03:10:32 So I fail to see I fail to see um what what you what the what point you're trying to make the framing the framing of this
03:10:41 that like you're like
03:10:43 He's like an underdog. He's a small child soldier underdog
03:10:47 And you're like this big bad like fucking dad trying trying to like try trying to fucking impose his values onto this community
03:10:57 Uh
03:10:59 Which is like I'm a complete outsider. Yeah
03:11:02 Yeah, I don't know
03:11:04 I don't know like
03:11:05 Again, he's just like so mad that he needs to convey
03:11:09 His emotions not through his words, but through a picture from a tv show because like that's
03:11:15 That's the best way he knows how and this was the best he could come up with
03:11:20 worthless
03:11:21 Yeah, worthless
03:11:23 Zero values without value
03:11:26 Worthless no merit. No merit. You thought no one was gonna care enough to rush on to this bullshit
03:11:32 You're dead wrong ass face
03:11:34 Did you not think for a single microsecond that did did you continue? I did. Yeah, you know
03:11:40 Oh, yeah here here. I'll here. I'll be sure it's at 1608
03:11:46 For some reason it just like doesn't work sometimes
03:11:50 All right here like like just like change it a little bit like like go back like a second or two
03:11:55 and then like
03:11:57 All right. Yeah. Yeah, okay good. Someone was gonna care enough to respond to this bullshit. You're dead wrong
03:12:03 Thanks. Did you not think for a single microsecond that this could get you in trouble that this could make someone feel uncomfortable
03:12:10 Get me more importantly. Did you not think that this would look obscenely bad on your part?
03:12:18 Yeah, he thinks he thinks that this will a get me in trouble
03:12:23 false
03:12:23 B
03:12:24 Make someone uncomfortable
03:12:26 True him. Yeah, see look bad on my part. Well, wrong if you're retarded
03:12:33 Like yeah, I'm I'm risking alienating some like overly sensitive retards here
03:12:38 I'm risking alienating the very people who I'm making fun of for being awful and undesirable
03:12:44 Yeah, I
03:12:46 I am alien like if I were to join the army. I am well look at something like if I were to like
03:12:52 Kill a Nazi. Yeah, I'm ricks alienating other. I would risk alienating Hitler
03:12:59 Yeah
03:13:01 problem
03:13:03 Yeah
03:13:05 If I alienate the very people who I want to dispose from reality
03:13:10 That I'm fine with that. I'm fine. I'm fine with alienating the very people who I dislike. Yeah. Yeah, um
03:13:17 I you're you've well said munchie and I like I wish I wish that I wish misanthropony could see things with such clarity
03:13:24 I wish I risk I I wish I wish
03:13:28 that misanthropony
03:13:31 Was real
03:13:32 I wish that he was a real person
03:13:35 But I know my heart of hearts that he's just like a computer ai designed to be the worst possible human
03:13:41 I
03:13:42 I wish that he I wish that he had a beating heart. I wish that he had a brain a dick or a soul
03:13:49 Any one of those things would be fine
03:13:51 But he has none
03:13:54 Oh, yeah, yeah, like we like because if you had any of those things we could revenge ourselves upon them
03:14:00 But we can't like there's nothing like there's nothing there's nothing to be struck back against
03:14:06 It's just it's just
03:14:09 We can't do anything. He's just too. He's just too powerful and my powerful. I mean
03:14:16 He like like what are we gonna do?
03:14:18 His mind is just armored. He's his mind is just armored too impenetrable. Yeah, like we can't it's like
03:14:25 Like if we can't say anything to like make him think like he's not cognizant. He's not cognizant
03:14:32 He's not lucid. There's no getting through to him. Yeah
03:14:36 there's no
03:14:37 Getting in there continue
03:14:40 Are you really this desperate to spike the analysis community?
03:14:44 That you would openly spit in the face of such a delicate event that has actually had an impact on people's lives
03:14:52 Yes, no regret. Yes, definitely with no reluctance
03:14:56 This entire video has just been you rambling on and on like a bitchy high schooler about how the brony fandom is below you
03:15:05 Which would be annoying enough on its own
03:15:07 But what you say here is thoroughly disgusting in the worst way possible
03:15:11 People say that tommy oliver is a backstabber
03:15:14 But you directly take the dagger shove it through the stomach and disembowel with it
03:15:20 At least he had the decency to raise awareness on a struck from the front
03:15:24 Honorably the way that you speak of it so absent mindedly shows me that you knew nothing about this situation
03:15:33 Thus you have no fucking right to comment on it
03:15:36 I have no and and what makes you feel like you
03:15:40 Know about the context of this video
03:15:42 What makes what makes it seem like you are in like you know anything about what's going on in this video
03:15:49 Or what's happening in the pcp?
03:15:51 You obviously sound like you don't know a single fucking thing you're talking about
03:15:55 So maybe it's likewise
03:15:57 Maybe maybe we don't want to think about each other
03:15:59 And there's no reason for you to get so mad because we obviously are just misunderstanding
03:16:03 Or but but that's obviously like too like high level. That's too like high strat
03:16:08 You can't just understand that like like okay if we don't want to think about that
03:16:13 You probably don't think about us too. So like what's the what's even the problem here?
03:16:16 Like like like we just don't know anything about it. So what's the problem?
03:16:20 I think he's mad like he's mad that I like he's mad at me because I didn't know anything
03:16:25 Exactly
03:16:26 And if you don't know anything then we obviously don't fucking know anything. So you might as well just brush us off
03:16:31 Yeah, man, and then he doesn't even try to fuck and he doesn't even try to educate us
03:16:36 Yeah, just try he just chides us for not knowing anything and then provides us with no information
03:16:40 Exactly
03:16:41 Fucker or earthly clue as to how any of your fans let alone subscribers to the procrastinator channel
03:16:48 Could actually get a kick out of this piece of shit video not okay. Okay. Okay
03:16:53 Most of our subscribers are not from the pony days. This is not a pony channel
03:16:58 Yeah, I sincerely doubt
03:17:01 Okay, okay. Look at the view the view count compared to the fucking subscriber count not like a small portion
03:17:06 It's like it's like it's like half or it's like a I can't even read it
03:17:10 But like yeah, it's like a quarter a half and like there's more. I think it's like doubled since then
03:17:14 Oh, yeah, okay. Well still still
03:17:16 Uh, it's like that and then this was paused around in the in the pony community
03:17:20 So I guess it's not a really good example, but yeah, what I mean. These are not pony guys
03:17:25 I'm I'm certain that the majority of our subscribers don't know who any of these fucking people are
03:17:31 They have no way to tell if we're being like justified or not and this is purely for us
03:17:38 We were not doing this for like the fans
03:17:40 No, like that's the point of the rowdy fuckers cop killers really it's not for anyone
03:17:45 It's for no one. Yeah
03:17:48 Ah
03:17:49 Just giving it views
03:17:51 But giving it likes the fact that mage is still willing to put up with you is a true act of saint
03:17:57 Here he goes white mighty white knighting mage because of something
03:18:00 Anyone else putting up with your insufferable ass except
03:18:04 It's like it's like he could say
03:18:07 Like ben I can't believe
03:18:11 Like like I think a reasonable thing would be to like
03:18:13 Suspect mage of being bad because she associates with with bad me and you
03:18:19 Yeah, but no, he's he's like impressed with how good mage must be
03:18:23 To be able to put up with with bad me and bad you how is that good?
03:18:27 How is how is associating and like clearly being friends with bad people? How is that good?
03:18:32 He's just got it
03:18:33 He's just previously decided that mage is good because he feels bad about something and it's like oh no
03:18:39 I thought mage was bad, but actually she was good. I made a mistake. So okay
03:18:42 I'm gonna fix it. The mage is good. Mage is good. Let's this is this is our operating position from here
03:18:47 That is literally he just oh wait. No no stop
03:18:49 Stop, okay. Yeah before you do that. I have one point and then I and then and then hold on uh like like
03:18:56 Like he is just arbitrary like like he just decides things
03:18:59 He does not think about things and then decide afterward what to do
03:19:03 He decides and then like reviews
03:19:06 Yeah, he did he decides and then he and then he like
03:19:09 He has he has his conclusion
03:19:11 And then he has his thought he then then he puts thought into into justifying it. Yeah, and yeah, it that's that's horrible
03:19:20 That he just one of the many things that shows that he just is not lucid. He's not he's not really it's really low functioning
03:19:26 And no wait, uh, just a side note
03:19:29 I want you I want everyone at home to turn up the speakers all the fucking way so you can hear this next line
03:19:34 Because I know what's coming and it's my favorite line in the entire video. So please play. I'm gonna be quiet
03:19:39 Enjoy your ignorant patreon supporters who are blissfully and mindlessly
03:19:44 Throwing enough money at you for you to buy yourself an oculus rift in two months time
03:19:49 Yeah, it doesn't feel so good when someone does it to you does it I could have
03:19:54 Okay
03:19:55 Yeah, you know
03:19:56 Yeah
03:19:57 my yeah, it's
03:20:00 Oculus rift
03:20:02 It's at this point in the video where I start to feel bad because we're obviously punching down
03:20:08 You're
03:20:10 We are obviously dealing with someone who's just like not
03:20:15 Who just can't like this is this would be the equivalent of like an MMA fighter going up against a fetus
03:20:23 Intellectually yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's no no not a stillborn baby who's already dead
03:20:29 Like
03:20:33 Yeah, like like can you imagine like trying to have like a lot like a live one-on-one conversation with this person
03:20:40 Yeah, like can you even imagine like the stonewalling you would get as he just like
03:20:45 Fails to fucking take in the information you're presenting him with
03:20:48 And just like backpedals and like invents facts to try and like cover his own his own like tracks like
03:20:56 Just the anyway, anyway, that's all to say like what the fuck is he talking about like with this oculus run
03:21:02 Okay, okay, okay. He like slightly explains the comments that
03:21:08 like
03:21:09 Like someone's like, you know three hundred and thirty dollars isn't a lot of money, dude
03:21:12 He's like all I'm saying is that he can buy an oculus an oculus lift rift in two months. Nothing. It could live on it
03:21:20 so he's like
03:21:23 Wow
03:21:24 Does that wow have to do
03:21:26 With fucking anything like he's trying to be he's trying to say like look at all this money
03:21:33 Like this guy's like look at all this money that this guy is like, you know
03:21:38 Can you believe that such an asshole would get this much and it's like
03:21:43 Three hundred and thirty dollars enough to buy an oculus rift in two pay jacks
03:21:48 Not in one in two
03:21:51 Will pay for an oculus rift. Yeah, if I didn't eat or live anywhere. Yeah
03:21:56 Completely saving he could buy an oculus rift in two months
03:22:01 Oh my fucking god. He can buy a video game console in fucking two months of work
03:22:09 Oh my god, this guy's living the lap of luxury. I know right like
03:22:14 Silver spoon in his mouth
03:22:16 Let's let's
03:22:18 Let's and that's not even to touch on the fact that he previously said
03:22:22 He previously said that it is like completely unthinkable and unfair and like unjust to like criticize someone else for their patreon
03:22:29 And now here he is. It's not too good when you do it. It's like, you know, it's a feel too good
03:22:34 You're doing what you don't like
03:22:36 You're doing the thing that you said it was so bad that I did and then and then he's uh, uh, I bit my tongue
03:22:42 Oh god, and then he's acting like oh, he's really turned the tables. It's like well, I guess but like
03:22:50 You are just making it worse for you
03:22:52 You you said this was wrong to do and then you're like, I've really I've really
03:22:58 I've I've shown you by doing it
03:23:00 Like like we obviously have no problem with doing that to people
03:23:04 So you know, but you said you did. Yeah, like like like he's he's the only one who's not benefiting from this
03:23:10 He's the only one who's at a disadvantage here. He's the only one who's feeling bad about it
03:23:15 Yeah, yeah, yeah
03:23:17 We are not affected you you're just doing this to yourself the problem is entirely the problem is entirely on his end. Yeah
03:23:25 Oh
03:23:26 Oculus Rift I just can't I can't go I just can't stop of all things to measure your wealth with why oculus rift
03:23:34 in it and then in the comment in the comments there was like people being like
03:23:39 So I think someone was like I really he's gonna buy an oculus rift with that money. What a piece of shit
03:23:45 Guys
03:23:46 wait
03:23:48 No, you don't you don't understand
03:23:51 We like
03:23:52 Have you ever even said the words oculus rift publicly? I don't I honestly don't think I ever have
03:23:59 So like where that came from. Maybe he was just thinking about the oculus rift that day, you know
03:24:04 Maybe maybe just had like like an oculus rift ad and he was like, oh, I love video games
03:24:10 And I love media so much. Yeah, he's gonna have so much money. He can spend it on media
03:24:17 Yeah, yeah, because like what else would I spend on like what else would a person spend their money on then video games? Yeah
03:24:24 I don't even know if this rift is pure video, but it's just fucking
03:24:28 It's so it's not like he could buy a fucking house in a year's time
03:24:33 He could he could spend so much money on grocery. He could he could get so many valuable things
03:24:38 an oculus rift of all
03:24:40 Yeah, it's
03:24:42 This is like this is the thing this is the thing that he measures wealth in, you know
03:24:46 Like this is a glimpse into what's important to him. Yeah
03:24:50 not of like
03:24:53 Rent removed. Yeah, not like rent or something. Yeah, or like
03:24:58 I don't yeah, or like a house or like a car
03:25:01 An oculus rift
03:25:03 That's it matters
03:25:05 And uh, this is all to say a check the description for the Kickstarter to get been an oculus rift. Yeah
03:25:11 um
03:25:13 Fuck dude when when we get pcp headquarters, we should fucking get an oculus rift
03:25:18 Yeah, and like fucking live stream and fucking live stream vr
03:25:22 We should get miss antherpony on that stream
03:25:24 He's invited miss antherpony is invited to pcp headquarters. He's invited
03:25:30 We wouldn't have thought of this if it weren't for you. Thank god. You said something
03:25:36 Oh, I hate him
03:25:38 So it's just it doesn't it it does not compute. It doesn't compute
03:25:44 No, he's made a critical error
03:25:47 He's made a he's made some kind of logical error that like just can't be rectified
03:25:51 Oh, should I continue?
03:25:58 What yeah
03:26:01 My i'm
03:26:02 I hate him imagine jesse wood and gibbon takes snoring through your content given how boring and repetitive it is
03:26:09 Considering that they themselves have made much more interesting content jesse and hippo are my friends
03:26:15 I would sooner watch one of racer fists aimless republican superior
03:26:20 What okay, okay. Well, that was pretty good right that's right there about razor fist
03:26:25 but uh
03:26:26 Like first of all we are like, I don't know if he understands like the pcp isn't like
03:26:32 This is this funny because you were just talking about how it's too business oriented like last episode
03:26:36 But like yes, but it's not supposed to be that way. Yeah, it's it's not like
03:26:40 It's not like we like we like clock in from nine to five and we like we like hash this out
03:26:44 And like like we're not in like a huge like studio where like we like barely pass by one another
03:26:50 We are aware of each other and we like know what we all do. We're all subscribed one another
03:26:55 We're all we all like our friends
03:26:59 Like so so the idea that like so the idea that like mage would be like saintly like putting up with my like
03:27:06 like my like wicked deeds
03:27:08 And then like and then hippo and jesse are like scoffing at me just aren't aware of what we're doing
03:27:13 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah that they wouldn't know
03:27:16 Like no they know and they love it because we're geniuses
03:27:22 And it's incredible
03:27:25 Like
03:27:27 Your heroes you you're fucking heroes give and take and and and jesse
03:27:32 Yeah, they they they enjoy it. They like they're on our like they're on our side of this
03:27:37 They're on our side of this dispute guy
03:27:40 I don't know about jesse, but I know for a fact a gibbon is hippo is
03:27:44 I'm pretty sure jesse. I don't know. I don't remember if he said anything about it. I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure he was on it
03:27:50 Either way, that's one out of two
03:27:52 yeah
03:27:55 Uh, great. All right, let's let's keep going. Let's let's let's let's kill this
03:28:03 Oh, did we did it go for you? No, it didn't it didn't go for me. Okay. Yeah, go go go ahead
03:28:10 Uh rambles before I even is going for you
03:28:14 To revisit one of your t-bab videos again right now
03:28:17 You are one of the worst things that has ever happened to the brony phantom. Yeah, look how terrible that is
03:28:23 Look how cool phantom work is that we're sent to aim to ketan rogers
03:28:26 Literally the best thing that has ever happened to the analysis community is that you left it
03:28:32 You are a piss-gargling scumbag who deserves to lose all the popularity. He currently has
03:28:39 All the popularity all of the patreon pledges that are being given to this micro
03:28:44 Penis ass wipe and give it to me so that she actually has something to eat outside of whatever's left over from his mcdonald's happy meal
03:28:51 And by the way, what the way, you know, did she bro? I don't know what he's
03:28:58 What
03:29:00 I think he's saying that I eat mcdonald's and eating mcdonald's is bad and I eat happy meals because
03:29:08 saying like
03:29:10 Mage
03:29:11 Okay, the three like the three ideas there are that
03:29:16 Maid doesn't have a lot of money ergo is eating table scraps, of course
03:29:20 A lot of money on patreon ergo is eating table scraps. Yeah
03:29:26 uh
03:29:27 and she like
03:29:29 like he says
03:29:31 something like
03:29:33 Play it again like roll back. I need like digest so that she'll have something to eat besides the leftovers from his
03:29:39 mcdonald's happy meal also
03:29:41 I just want to say that like if he thinks that if he's showing this picture of phantom horn
03:29:45 And he doesn't think that it's great like like he's he's just so fucking
03:29:48 He's just so fucking out of touch because this is like the greatest thing that ever
03:29:51 This is this is the best thing that ever happened to the mlp fandom and like the fact that he
03:29:56 Like the fact that he thinks that telling me that like
03:29:59 It's good that I left like the fact that he thinks that would like hurt my feelings. Yeah
03:30:04 Like this is again, we're just we're just getting a glimpse into it. It's just like watching it's like walking
03:30:09 It's like walking up to like a renaissance pain and say like oh my fucking god
03:30:12 This is the worst thing to ever happen to medieval times. I'm so sorry that like I'm so sorry that like we got like machines
03:30:18 And like advance to the modern era. What the fuck
03:30:22 What the fuck dude?
03:30:24 Lee has you know what we should do
03:30:26 We should take all of the patreon pledges that are being given to this micro penis ass wipe
03:30:31 And give it to mage so that she actually has something to eat outside of whatever's leftover from his mcdonald's happy meal
03:30:38 And by the way by the way, you know digi bro that great friend of yours that you were hesitant to say anything bad about
03:30:45 While you were criticizing everybody
03:30:47 Yeah, he's a pretentious sick muncher who stumped his thumb up people's asses over how they produced their anime content
03:30:55 I honestly don't get like I don't know like I don't know about that video instead
03:31:00 He practically makes the same content and he's not a complete conch and oh my god
03:31:06 Oh my god
03:31:09 Just the woeful just the woeful ignorance like
03:31:14 Telling me this like it's a great revelation
03:31:17 Like oh like he's spilling the beans that oh digi's an asshole
03:31:21 And we should watch jeff like he doesn't know like shouldn't he know that like we kick jeff out
03:31:27 Okay, well first of all first of all on record. I think I said this last time too. I'm I'm I'm pro jeff and I think jeff is cool
03:31:34 I don't care. I don't care one bit about jeff is
03:31:38 Does he not know that jeff was on the pcp?
03:31:43 He might he might know that
03:31:46 He doesn't seem like he knows like
03:31:50 That doesn't like like like oh, why isn't jeff on here's way better than did you know like we should all watch this guy
03:31:57 Because I think he I think he's thinking that like he's problem
03:32:00 He might be drawing the equivalents. They're like because jeff was on the pcp
03:32:05 All right fair fair, I suppose
03:32:08 Uh, but first okay. Yeah, but to go back
03:32:11 I'll concede maybe maybe he knows
03:32:14 Something about the pcp. Maybe maybe he knows one fact about the pcp. I'll give him that. Yeah. Yeah
03:32:20 First of all again, we're all friends of one another. We all know what we do
03:32:25 Ben you lived in the same house as did you when he yeah at this time. Yeah, yeah, yeah
03:32:32 But of course he wouldn't know that yeah, I lived in his house
03:32:35 You lived in you were roommates
03:32:40 You lived at his house. You lived in the same house when he made that video
03:32:46 Yeah, yeah true
03:32:48 It's not like a loose confederation. It's not like a loot like we all know what we're doing
03:32:53 We are like like like look at this crate. Yeah, I bet you didn't know did you bro made this video
03:32:59 Well, well, well, well, you know what let me I'm not entirely sure whether he's
03:33:04 Trying to do like an expose and like expose digi as an asshole or if he's just trying to like hurt me by insulting my friend
03:33:11 You know
03:33:12 Oh
03:33:14 Maybe but like he might just be being like and about your friend digi. He sucks this guy's better, you know
03:33:23 If so completely irrelevant and also just weird and mean
03:33:27 Yeah, yeah, I mean he's just being mean like he's just being like
03:33:30 Like know what like nowhere in our video. Did I say I don't okay? I don't think I was like
03:33:36 Listen everyone who's pledging to tune critic y2k keyframe
03:33:41 Whoever the fuck else I don't think I I never said like
03:33:45 You all need to stop pledging to them and pledge to like me or pledge to hip or pledge to someone else
03:33:51 I didn't do that. I was just like man. I can't I don't think so
03:33:55 I don't think so because I think I was more like I just can't believe that people see value in this and are pledging and it
03:34:00 Upsets me
03:34:02 This and then for him to come and be like you all need to stop pledging to ben
03:34:07 Like I'm not worried
03:34:09 Like obviously I didn't think that it was going to happen, but it just strikes me as really malicious and
03:34:16 Just like a really nasty thing
03:34:18 To even want to do, you know
03:34:20 Yeah
03:34:21 Just like a really nasty thing to say and I really just really
03:34:26 Makes me kind of wonder why he thinks that why he thinks he's got any kind of moral high ground to come to like look down from
03:34:33 Hashtag save misanthropony not been
03:34:36 Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly
03:34:38 He needs it. He needs to be saved from himself
03:34:43 It's off
03:34:45 I'm gonna continue. Oh, oh, wait, wait. I was tried to do it. Uh, by the way, uh, he says, uh, your friend did you bro?
03:34:51 He was so hesitant to talk bad about uh, we just like didgy. Yeah, like have anything bad to say about him. He's yeah
03:34:59 It's it's weird like it's weird that that's not where his mind went
03:35:03 Yeah, like how he could not piece that together
03:35:06 Like yeah, like it's yeah
03:35:08 In the comment section of this video because no reply that you make will ever justify the unbearable level of ignorance that you displayed
03:35:17 And fuck you shit, man. Whoever the fuck you are for accompanying this madness
03:35:28 Why doesn't he know who you are
03:35:31 What he just showed a video of mine earlier. He showed to your dad. You know who I am
03:35:38 like
03:35:39 I don't I don't get it. I don't get like what
03:35:43 He's talking about like why doesn't he know who you are like he well
03:35:46 He knows the pcp like he's familiar with what's going on there. How can he not know?
03:35:52 like like
03:35:54 I he's just
03:35:56 I have no idea what information he has and what doesn't
03:36:00 You see like it's a rant like it's random some information. He just has to block out some
03:36:05 Yeah, have the full picture, but how are we supposed to know?
03:36:09 I don't get it. I don't I don't know and like me like fuck you too much if you're accompanying this madness
03:36:16 Not fuck you too for saying the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like
03:36:21 It was like this was a group effort. This was a group like it's not like it's not like I committed a crime and you like
03:36:27 Covered for me. It's like we were both in it doing the exact same thing. Yeah
03:36:33 I don't know
03:36:34 I don't know man
03:36:36 Like like why like like like why is he maybe he just doesn't know me so it doesn't matter
03:36:41 But like that's still like a it feels like it feels like the crime isn't that you just did these things
03:36:47 But that you were in the community and did these things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was gonna say it's like it's personal for me
03:36:54 like for me it's personal
03:36:56 Uh
03:37:00 Yeah, yeah, like like when it's me it's a betrayal
03:37:04 But but when it's me it's just me doing bad things
03:37:07 Which you know, if you're so much just doing bad things, I don't who cares. He's just doing horrible things. I find your poor
03:37:13 Yeah, yeah, but if he didn't use if I didn't use to think he was an ally then it's no big deal
03:37:20 Jesus Christ
03:37:22 Know that a lot of people who were featured in your video have seen it already and they've been pretty merciful towards you
03:37:28 But not me. So I've got one thing to say to you pal
03:37:32 Own up to your stupidity and take responsibility for it because people are generally not gonna want to put up with your
03:37:40 Shit, you're lucky that I decided to format the audio for this video before golden fox sent anything to me
03:37:46 I'm pretty sure he has some very special choice words for you after what you just said about his girlfriend
03:37:53 Um fun fact. No, he doesn't uh, he never said a thing to me. So there we go
03:37:58 And hold on hold on. I just want to analyze it soon as for a second
03:38:01 So he formatted his audio before like you're lucky. I did that before golden fox sent anything to me
03:38:07 So I'm sure that must mean that that he was like chatting with golden fox and was like, oh man
03:38:12 You should send something my name was like, oh, I don't know
03:38:15 But I I want to just imagine I want I want this headcanon to be real. I want this to be what I actually had
03:38:21 I wanted I wanted golden fox to come at me. Like I thought that sounded great
03:38:25 Well, okay. Okay. I want this to be what happened
03:38:28 He missanthropony knows about golden fox
03:38:33 And he knows that he is dating keyframe
03:38:36 So he watches this video and he like makes a video
03:38:40 He like makes a video and then he's just thinking
03:38:44 man
03:38:45 What if golden fox sent me some audio that would be crazy like he like like like do you understand what i'm saying here?
03:38:50 Like he doesn't know
03:38:52 Yeah, yeah, yeah, like like this is not a thing that was ever like actually going to go down
03:38:56 Yeah, this is just like what he wanted because he says it's odd to me that he says he's pretty sure
03:39:02 The golden fox has some choice where like that vague wording makes me wonder like what he's actually talking about
03:39:07 Yeah, so I want to just conclude like I want this to be I'm sure this isn't the case
03:39:12 This seems unlikely, but I want to be the case that he just does not know golden fox and golden fox doesn't even know about this
03:39:18 Know about fucking frog fractions
03:39:21 He just knows that they are like related
03:39:24 I don't I'm not sure. I kind of think that maybe
03:39:28 He did but like I don't know. I never thought about it. Yeah, maybe maybe he doesn't maybe maybe golden fox
03:39:34 Just like listen, I don't care and and and uh and miss anthro is just like choice words
03:39:41 Yeah, exactly fucking jesus christ
03:39:43 I mean golden fox like I said, I would have I would have loved it if golden fox had been like
03:39:47 Hey, I heard you talking shit about my girlfriend like I would have loved to defend my position to him or keyframe herself
03:39:54 But nobody ever said anything
03:39:57 Fuck you and have a nice day and if I see you anywhere near brony conigan, I'm slamming my foot up your dick
03:40:04 Oh
03:40:06 Jesus christ, what a nice guy. Yeah, what a nice dude
03:40:10 Really really vindictive when we obviously had the tone that we didn't actually care in that video
03:40:15 Like like none of this is really negatively impacting us
03:40:18 Like like to to him. This is personal like like like like to him
03:40:22 The right there just talking to his frog fractions was the end of the world, but to us it was Tuesday
03:40:27 Exactly exactly. I don't know. It's just it bugs me
03:40:30 It bugs me that he can like think this is okay that like I
03:40:34 Say mean things about someone and his and what he believes to be an appropriate response to that is like to fucking kick
03:40:40 Someone in the dick, which is an action that can cause like serious injury, you know
03:40:45 Like he's like he thinks it's fine. Like he thinks it's fine to threaten violence against someone
03:40:51 Like he thinks that's appropriate
03:40:53 And like what do you even say to a person like that?
03:40:56 I'm not I'm not trying to be all bleed and heart like oh he threatened me but like for fuck's sake
03:41:02 I just it's just completely unwarranted and disgusting like
03:41:08 like
03:41:09 He is doing everything that we that he considered bad in that video, but worse 10 times worse and more personal
03:41:16 Yeah, we didn't spend I mean, I mean, I mean sure I'm sure we spend like large segments talking about one person
03:41:23 But none of it was this in-depth and like personally like
03:41:27 Like we never had like fucking like like like like material. We never had like oh here. I'm gonna edit this
03:41:32 I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking script this it was all off the cuff
03:41:35 Normal just friends like shit talking in like completely closed off
03:41:40 Yeah, none of it was this highly edited our video was not a hit video unlike this one, which is explicitly was yeah
03:41:50 Speaking of hit videos, um
03:41:52 Shall we go on to the next one?
03:41:53 Should we go on to the next man? That one took a long time to get through
03:41:56 I don't know if I don't I don't know if I've got the energy to like spend to pick this next one apart to that extent
03:42:02 Well, I certainly do so you can just pick it back off me
03:42:05 It's because this next one is like really like that one was mean to you
03:42:09 This one's like mean to us both this one
03:42:12 Yeah, this one's real this one's real shitty and like
03:42:15 Even less coherent. We have to understand
03:42:18 Here here like this one. I honestly can't even understand like what his point is. Yeah, uh, okay
03:42:23 I watched this one before obviously and I just want to I just want to let you go
03:42:27 Oh, by the way, we should mention that that video you just watched was by Miss Anthropony
03:42:32 It was called something like uh, you know taking down been saying uh all credits, you know
03:42:37 That was his video go ahead and watch that if you want to not claim your ownership there
03:42:41 It's you know a little disclaimer. Anyway, this is by fngr for no good reason
03:42:45 How not to bring 35 of tumblr insane?
03:42:48 Okay, I watched this before
03:42:50 I don't understand it whatsoever. I do not know what this video is
03:42:56 Miss Anthropony's video was about the video like at the very least you can you can
03:43:00 You know what the point of that video was like like reading between reading between the lines
03:43:06 You can understand what it is that Miss Anthropony feels about the video and like what it is that's bothering him
03:43:12 That video was a response to right-fingers copulars fog for actions
03:43:16 That was describing what happened in the video that made him upset. Sure. None of his points make sense
03:43:20 But you can understand what the video is. Yeah, I do not understand what this for no good reasons video is
03:43:28 His like there's no like none of his none of his things that he says like point to any like central idea
03:43:35 Or like reason which I guess that's his name. Haha his name. Yeah. Yeah good
03:43:41 um
03:43:42 Like this one is like
03:43:44 Basically the like this entire not the whole video is about us
03:43:48 But the part that is is like just calling us shit and like not even trying to back that up
03:43:54 Yeah, go ahead and start it
03:43:57 Are we first or we later? I don't I don't think
03:44:04 This is a last minute pre word before I get to being needlessly bitchy
03:44:09 I'm not I think I skip with me. Sorry. Sorry. I don't want to I skip the important
03:44:15 Yeah, yeah, we just gotta find out I think it only goes I think the first like eight minutes or so are about us
03:44:19 Yeah, it's just probably first us and then later. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know some weeks ago
03:44:25 I oh, I should say that before this video came out fngr
03:44:29 Tweeted at me
03:44:30 And he was just like I don't remember what he said, but he was asking me like are we cool?
03:44:36 And I was like
03:44:37 What what do you mean? Like what wouldn't we be cool about? I think
03:44:41 I don't even know if I mentioned him in the frog fractions video, but I think I did
03:44:46 Yeah, yeah, maybe you did
03:44:48 But he was asking me like are we cool and I was like are we cool about what?
03:44:51 And he was real cagey and he kept asking like are we cool are we cool?
03:44:54 I'm just checking and finally I was like what are you fucking talking about
03:44:59 And he or I forget how I phrase it, but I got mad. I was like what I said like what are you talking about you cagey?
03:45:04 Fuck. Yeah, he was like never mind
03:45:07 And like dropped it and then a couple days later this video comes out. Oh, okay, and let me read the text on screen
03:45:12 Uh, boy, I can't wait to get this puke
03:45:14 Uh, this puke class. This is what a fail abortion looks like that wasn't capitalized
03:45:20 I'm actually such a garbage human being if he was the crap and the divus diaper
03:45:24 Uh, the dude's girlfriend's diaper. Uh, he dumped her
03:45:28 Okay, pretty good pretty good so far
03:45:31 I'm enjoying this content pretty yeah, yeah pretty good content so far pretty good
03:45:36 Uh, we're really getting the lulls here, bro. We're really getting the lulls here. I'm gonna laugh out loud when I see this
03:45:41 This is just setting the tone for what to expect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this is this amount of intelligence we're dealing with here
03:45:47 Uh, hang tight. We'll get there Ben. I need you to focus reach down deep
03:45:51 Percent like there's a big bag of pain chips waiting. Look at how he spells theirs
03:45:56 Wait, wait, it didn't work for me for some reason. Yeah. Yeah, here. That one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there we go. There we go. There we go
03:46:02 Yeah, yeah
03:46:04 Look, just look at how he spells theirs. Like I don't understand of what joke he's trying to make here
03:46:09 Just the spelling is it's funny problem naturally
03:46:12 There's the horse news situation, but that looks like a big one
03:46:16 This is a last minute pre word before I get to being needlessly bitchy
03:46:20 I'm not interested in the moral high ground. This is not me being the better man
03:46:25 I've glanced at and skimmed Miss Anthropony's video on this topic and left it up for attention
03:46:30 So he can get his sweet 20 minutes. I could work really hard to pander why I'm right and ben's wrong
03:46:36 I'm just gonna be salty right and wrong about what we called chelise's bluff last night
03:46:41 That being tuesday to have a talk with tune critic and chelise in true horse news fashion
03:46:47 Dick tucked despite having a skype account. He said that he didn't have the means to log on to it anymore
03:46:52 Journalism folks like even if you forgot the password it would take him what 60 seconds one minute
03:46:57 Should I skip a little bit? Let's see. I think so. Yeah, it's all just bullshit. The horse news is still stuck on the
03:47:02 Where he had tried to oh, yeah
03:47:06 Oh, here we go. Here we go. Goldfish. I nasty youtube thing. Dear ben saint
03:47:11 I know you're too lazy or too stupid to walk kind of looks like a 20 year old
03:47:14 I'm actually older than that. That's right. I bent over backwards monday to try and make peace with you
03:47:19 Ben had done a four-hour hit video on the brawny fandom
03:47:23 Where he had tried to bend over backwards to impress his fellow pcp member munchie the mongoloid knuckle dragon of the group
03:47:30 Dear munchie
03:47:33 First of all, yeah, what the fuck are you talking about? I don't I mean
03:47:40 There's so there's just so like everything he says is nonsense
03:47:43 I mean like if he was trying to make pee like he didn't try to make peace
03:47:47 He asked me if there was anything wrong and I said I didn't know what would be wrong
03:47:52 And like I don't know what and then he kept pressing me until I got annoyed and basically told him to go away
03:47:57 Yeah, and then he left and was mad at me. That's bad
03:48:01 But the way he describes the video like okay, first of all, it's obviously he calls it a hit video
03:48:07 Yeah, that didn't even he didn't even watch missanthropone's 20 minute response to it. Yeah, he just skimmed
03:48:13 Okay, so right off the bat. He just doesn't know what he's talking about. He just does not understand. Yeah
03:48:17 So he so so I guess this is again punching down
03:48:20 Like we like we shouldn't even be doing this because he obviously just does not understand anything
03:48:25 I mean, I said it about missanthropone. I said about fngr
03:48:28 I really believe it in both cases like I really think they're retarded and there's something wrong with them because they
03:48:32 Just don't act or speak or behave or like convey thoughts in the way that like a functioning human being does
03:48:38 Yeah, and and like we wouldn't I like if it was just like
03:48:42 I don't really understand what's going on. They were being mean to key for like again, like I wouldn't care
03:48:47 But this guy gets like mean
03:48:49 He gets fngr gets mean and never says why he never says why?
03:48:53 Uh, but but yeah, okay, but the way he described it as you made the frog fractions video to bend over backwards to appease me
03:49:01 The mongrel, where does he get that idea?
03:49:04 Like where does that come from? What does that mean?
03:49:09 What
03:49:10 What?
03:49:11 It's like what does it not enter these people's heads that maybe we're just friends and we want to hang out and be friends
03:49:17 And talk shit about people that suck. Yeah
03:49:20 Like could that could that is that not a reasonable explanation for why this is a video?
03:49:26 How like
03:49:27 That's not like a marketable that you can't even say that was for money. That's not a marketable video
03:49:32 No, that's not like what people want to see that's that wouldn't get us money
03:49:36 And how would that appease me to do that?
03:49:39 how
03:49:40 You like like I don't even know most of those like I don't of them and I had stuff to say but it's not like like like
03:49:48 I don't have the I don't have the beef here. I just kind of ride the beef. I read the coattails the beef basically
03:49:54 Like I want like I want to theorize like where this idea comes from
03:49:57 But I've just got nothing like I've got no idea why he thinks that like I'm trying to impress you
03:50:04 with any of this
03:50:06 I don't understand. I don't understand
03:50:09 Continue
03:50:10 I'm gonna take care of you right now. This is my friend Vita. I could spare 100 munchies to a single Vita
03:50:16 For those of you guys who don't know once upon a time ago Vita used to be boys with digi bro
03:50:21 And digi bro cut Vita out because and Vita got all bitchy and huffy about it because and the ensuing
03:50:27 Shitstorm has reached levels of fuckery that the bernie fandom might not have known
03:50:32 Well, if not for this channel
03:50:33 Munchies case on like digis where digi just cut Vita off and Vita
03:50:37 Wondered up taking it very poorly about as bad as say lily peat took being cut off from joss scorcher
03:50:42 Munchie
03:50:43 Did the same thing and Vita asked for me to go find out to which munchie told me
03:50:47 Sometimes some niggas just don't get along anymore and that's fine
03:50:51 And Vita's response was and nothing of value was lost
03:50:55 Vita didn't mindlessly harass munchie. He let shit go
03:50:59 In fact, I was really proud that Vita had the most mature rare moment
03:51:02 I've ever seen him have in one of these situations. Later on Vita snuck his way here here
03:51:07 Let me pause this so I can explain what's going on. Uh Vita made accounts on steam over and over trying to add me
03:51:14 That is a fact that is what he did and I'm pretty sure the timeline of this
03:51:19 After effing you're asked me he didn't do it anymore, which was fine
03:51:22 The facts still remains after I blocked him and I'm fairly certain that I that I said I blocked you or even if I didn't
03:51:28 He could take the hint making a ton of accounts to message me and me ignoring every single one
03:51:34 Probably doesn't seem like I want to talk does it?
03:51:37 You know like he's
03:51:41 I which like fngr just he just goes off on this thing and like there's no context given as to like why there's be
03:51:48 like he says that like Vita used to be boys with digi and then
03:51:53 something about you and
03:51:55 Something see like this isn't even like drama
03:51:59 This is just like a weird sort of like Vita wanted to be friends still
03:52:03 Or maybe he just it just seemed like you want maybe he didn't want to be friends
03:52:06 Maybe he just wanted to talk for some reason. I didn't want to talk so I didn't accept his friend's request. That's it
03:52:12 That's the entirety of what transpired, you know the entire the entire section was just uh mean vita didn't talk anymore
03:52:18 That's it the the the thing that i'm getting here like I've thought about this before and I like the closest thing
03:52:24 I can get to like
03:52:25 An underlying reason for why fngr is so upset is I really think that was like vita that was upset
03:52:32 Like I really think he's upset on behalf of vita because of probably because we shit talked him and we like went and tried
03:52:37 And I I deleted his page even though I knew it would come back
03:52:40 Yeah, um, so like I think I think that he's indignant because we were mean to vita
03:52:46 And I think that probably what this video is is just like a sort of diarrhea stream
03:52:51 That like came squirting out as the like as the aftermath of like some really angry like back and
03:52:57 Forthing between like the people that like fngr hangs out with like, you know corpulent brony and vita
03:53:03 and
03:53:04 Shelley d and like whoever the fuck else like I think this is like they kind of took this idea that like oh ben and munchy
03:53:10 Were mean to vita echo chambered it around being like oh well, they're bad. They're the ones who are bad
03:53:15 They're shitty and I hate them and then like this video is what's like squirted out like of the black box
03:53:21 Like we don't see we don't get to see what went into it. Yeah
03:53:24 Yeah, yeah, we don't we don't really know what happened there
03:53:27 We just know that this is like the feeling that this indescribable in like
03:53:32 Unfathomable video is what was is what was created
03:53:35 We don't like it's just we can't describe what it is because it makes no sense
03:53:40 It's really like it really feels like it's all based on like some some like cultural some like
03:53:46 Like clicky shit that is like deeply understood by like five people. Yeah
03:53:51 But we have like no context for but then like a thousand people watch it anyway because it's like vaguely related to the brony fandom
03:53:57 And that means it's worth watching for some reason
03:54:00 I just I don't understand
03:54:02 Now by the way, and none of this is a point about the video. This is just like weird backstory between me and vita
03:54:07 Continue. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah where he was getting along with people in there
03:54:12 We'll more the fans and say the pcp members, but that was never gonna happen
03:54:16 I fully understand that vita didn't belong there. We kind of popped in the call and munchi showed up and went
03:54:22 What are you doing here vita? Nobody likes you kill yourself. Oh, hi fng. Are you're cool?
03:54:27 Let me respond munchi. No, I don't also when you first of all
03:54:32 I don't think I like my entire okay. I know I might have said
03:54:38 Me, you know fng. You're cool. My entire
03:54:42 Knowledge of fngr was that he was like this weird like shady sketchy guy that I didn't like
03:54:47 But I knew I knew that people thought were cool. So I was like, okay
03:54:50 I guess I'll just like I I never wanted to be friends with fng. I just thought like, okay
03:54:55 I won't start shit like I'll start shit with vita because I hate him. Yeah
03:54:59 And uh, that's my entire like I I never was like trying to like like boot lick fngr
03:55:06 Because I I didn't like him, but I I didn't think it was okay to not like him. So I didn't want to start any shit. Yeah
03:55:15 By the way, I still like don't even know like what's being like
03:55:18 I guess they came into a call at some point. Like I don't know what the call was
03:55:22 I don't know like when this was happening or I will explain the entirety of what
03:55:27 Of what this person tried to explain. I will explain to you in like human terms
03:55:32 Yeah, one day in the pcp fan chat vita came in and uh, he was acting kind of weird
03:55:38 And then I was like, oh man, it's vita. What a fucking weird asshole
03:55:41 And then I called him a weird asshole and told him kill himself
03:55:44 And then I told sorry, but how he fucked digi's chair and he got all embarrassed
03:55:48 And and uh, people made fun of him a lot because he was being weird and creepy and an asshole
03:55:54 Uh, he wasn't he wasn't even being like that like, you know, he wasn't even being that weird
03:55:58 It was just vita and I hate vita. So I wanted to make fun of that was like a that's understandable to me
03:56:04 Yeah, I just don't like vita. So I wanted to give him a bad time
03:56:07 Like I've heard I've heard enough about vita that I don't think he deserves the benefit of the doubt
03:56:12 Yeah
03:56:13 And so that happened and then fngr was there too and they they gone to a call by them
03:56:17 Like in a voice call by themselves like it like they joined the voice channels
03:56:20 What I'm saying not like a call off on their own they got into the voice channel
03:56:24 I was going to but I was out of the house and uh, so I just I just told him to kill himself and the
03:56:28 I think he's gay and then jesse came in and then uh, me and jesse talked about how uh, stupid and uh,
03:56:34 Faggy uh, vita is and vita got really pissed off and like mad and like uh, like like angry, uh
03:56:40 Like like angry and started crying like pissing his pants and then he like left
03:56:43 Or no, he didn't left we banned him and then he tried to make all the counts to come back and spam the pcp chat
03:56:48 Because quote he said this to one of the mods quote. There's nothing more dangerous than man with nothing left to lose
03:56:55 But oh my god all of his attempts to come back to the pcb fan chat
03:56:59 We're in vain because we immediately realized and banned him
03:57:02 We just immediately banned him. He didn't even have time to spam
03:57:05 Like like he came back like six or seven times and i'm fairly certain and uh, we just banned him like immediately and he didn't
03:57:12 He didn't have any of the epic trolling lulls that he wanted to he was completely and utterly defeated
03:57:16 And nothing he did ever mattered
03:57:18 So he was just pissing his pants publicly and we always made fun of him for being retarded and it was great
03:57:24 It was a great time
03:57:25 Uh, sounds pretty good. Um, should I continue? Yeah, go ahead
03:57:30 You were in the pfc munchie. You acted like a cringy autistic kick who literally screeched into his mic
03:57:35 You went full retard and everyone bent over backwards to be cool with you after vita came back
03:57:42 To say hi and he acted like you were a big deal
03:57:45 You're a star fucker munchie. I want ben to know if you could ever step over him for something bigger
03:57:51 You wouldn't a heartbeat so you could be an even bigger toadie munchie
03:57:55 You're a sniveling groveling two-faced puke once upon a time ago
03:57:59 You blew your nose and showed it to digi and that's not bubble somehow resembled fan art and you
03:58:05 Indeered yourself to someone talented. That's why you are where you are. Shit. That was me
03:58:10 You're been seeing someone else I just I just
03:58:15 Munchie I I know I know that you'll betray me if I ever give you a chance
03:58:19 But but you're like that's that's that's just what I would expect like like I wouldn't ever I wouldn't expect anything less of you
03:58:24 So like I keep you around to keep me on my toes so I don't slip up and get sloppy
03:58:30 Okay, okay, so so a lot of things a lot of things here first of all go back like well, no not go back
03:58:34 I'm gonna go back in my brain to the beginning of that clip where he describes a story
03:58:39 I told on five fractions one where I once went through the pony fuck cast which uh, I don't really remember my interaction with them a lot
03:58:46 I I do I like I described a story where uh meeting a couple friends went into that chat room
03:58:52 And described the history of the Byzantine empire to uh them and it was very funny. I thought it was very funny
03:58:58 uh, that did happen and uh, I'm sure like I was pretty
03:59:04 Like I I I kind of a dodgy memory. Uh, I'm by the memory of the goldfish
03:59:08 And I don't truly remember how often I was associated with the pony fuck cast but I know
03:59:12 Vita added me to cause a lot. I know that for a fact
03:59:16 So I had a lot answer twice to yeah. Yes
03:59:19 So I'm sure I had a lot of interaction with them and I'm sure one time I did scream
03:59:23 I'm sure what I'm a screaming kind of guy. I'm sure I did scream for a while
03:59:27 I don't doubt that that happened
03:59:28 But I also don't doubt that my fucking weird Byzantine empire story happened
03:59:32 So that's not really a gotcha. That's not like there were just two times probably he's saying all these things like they're gotchas like he
03:59:39 It's like everything he says it's like he thinks he's like really he's really like
03:59:43 Putting some shit out there and then it's all just like but it's all just like a big star fucker great
03:59:49 Like he was on to say that like I I'm only friends with digi because I'm I gave him fanner one time and that is completely accurate
03:59:56 Yeah, that is not I'm not like how like how
03:59:59 Yeah, like that like I don't know. How do you fucking meet people? How do you fucking meet people fngr? You fuck?
04:00:06 Yeah, and so like like like we like again, this wasn't to appease me
04:00:11 We just did that because we are friends and we like to have fun
04:00:16 It's like he's reading all these like sinister
04:00:19 Intentions he's reading he's reading all these like weird like Machiavellian power plays into the whole thing that are just not
04:00:27 I'm a star fucker like like
04:00:30 If I was a star fucker, I could do a little bit better than been saying don't you think? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you could you could um
04:00:38 Oh, no, I'm sad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you could go after jeff. Oh man
04:00:43 Um, that'd be really easy mean jeff got into a good
04:00:47 On a good fire red calm. We could easily I could easily use jeff for subs that would be incredibly easy
04:00:54 I you know, I could do for subs. I could not make the Japanese Juggalo ARG
04:00:59 I could I do not do that. I could make anime videos instead of making the Japanese Juggalo ARG
04:01:04 But I don't because I'm a weird fucking emotionally stunted freak and I just want to do cool things. Yeah, like
04:01:12 We're like we're not we're not
04:01:15 We're all here. We're all here because this is where we belong, you know
04:01:19 Not because not because we're not here on some like false pretense. Yeah, it's like there's there's
04:01:26 If we were if we if like if the pcp
04:01:28 Were a thing that we're just like
04:01:31 A business. Yeah, if like if we were here to do business and we were here to like promote an agenda
04:01:36 Like there would be better ways to do that like that's
04:01:39 You know fngr. He just doesn't fucking get it and why would he you know? Yeah, he just doesn't he just doesn't understand a single fucking thing
04:01:47 Yeah, continue. No Ben phantom horn. You ever see the movie twins the one where Arnold Schwarzenegger and I love this
04:01:54 Twin brothers
04:01:55 There's a line in there
04:01:56 When they're talking to old Arnold and saying that all the greatness went into him and all this shit that went into his brother
04:02:02 Afterwards now. This is best guy ever clearly. You know who this is. I'm gonna do this nice and slow
04:02:08 This is the Arnold in this situation, Ben. You're the shit that got left over the pig lips and assholes
04:02:15 You're why does he big old batter of hot dog goo?
04:02:19 Yeah
04:02:20 Yeah
04:02:20 The brony gets more views than your nez lock series and that's with you having that's that's not that's not true anymore
04:02:26 By the way, I've passed him
04:02:29 I don't know. Well, why is he why is he so why is he so sweet on Nate?
04:02:34 Yeah, yeah, do like what did like what did Nate do to be what did Nate do for him to be like?
04:02:38 Wow, this guy's really bad
04:02:40 But his brother is like the cool guy like this like this like that that guy's cool with me
04:02:45 And this guy's that's not a one-off thing. He mentioned that again
04:02:48 How like how like like ben is like this groveling disgusting sack of shit, but like Nate's so cool
04:02:55 Yeah, what yeah, he shows I believe the kin hearts lecture. Is is that what got you on Nate that video?
04:03:03 that of all videos
04:03:06 I mean
04:03:08 I don't know he's like
04:03:11 I don't think like I'm sure that Nate doesn't interact with fngr
04:03:14 I'm sure that Nate thinks that fngr is is retarded just like I do like
04:03:20 There's no doubt in my mind that like we're completely on the same page about fngr
04:03:25 And yet here he is
04:03:26 Being like then why can't you be cool?
04:03:29 Why can't you be nice and good and and a cool guy like this other guy that thinks I suck ass?
04:03:35 Yeah, I don't understand and also since we're past the mungy part that had no
04:03:41 There was no point there
04:03:43 The point was simply that I was like oh
04:03:46 It was simply that I was a mongoloid. That was the point
04:03:49 I mean the point here is simply that I am inferior to Nate. Yeah
04:03:54 Like there's no
04:03:55 There's no relation to the ratty fucking cop killers. There's no there's no reason given. Yeah, it's just
04:04:02 It's just stated as facts. Yeah, and and and and because because I was mean to vita justly
04:04:09 Therefore, I'm a therefore. I'm a mongoloid and a star fucker. Yeah. Yeah, and and
04:04:15 Again
04:04:16 Why make this video?
04:04:18 You're not making any points of that the friday fuckers fired frack frack frack frack is a bad video
04:04:24 You're just making a video that we are bad people for like he called rowdy. He called rowdy fuckers cop killers a hit video
04:04:30 But like a hit video is exactly what this is. This is nothing but that and we and it wasn't a hit video
04:04:36 It was just us shitting around. Yeah, like it wasn't even mostly about that. Yeah
04:04:42 Um, all right. Okay continue
04:04:44 One thousand subs than me. I'm told that you're pissed that tune critic is making more money than yourself
04:04:49 Well, Ben, he's not even before he makes his streaming money
04:04:53 You seem to poke fun at the burning donut who unlike yourself
04:04:57 Went to be homeless then got a job and pulled himself up by his bootstrap
04:05:01 A man who holds you innate in a high regard
04:05:04 But then you turned around and act like a cunt to the man in front of your little mongoloid friend here with 700 subs
04:05:10 I tried to have a word. I'm really upset. You asked off to me 700 subs. So let me give you a reality
04:05:16 First first of all, how is your sub count relevant? Second of all?
04:05:20 I'm second. I mean, you know, I'm sorry if burning donut thinks I'm cool
04:05:24 Whatever the I don't I don't like his art and his fucking patreon was an embarrassment. So what what the fucking up?
04:05:29 What am I supposed to say?
04:05:30 Uh, and and and wearing a homing became don't a dirty and homely fucking burning donut became homeless
04:05:37 I'm pulled by his bootstraps. Oh, Ben. How's your living situation? How's that going out? How's that working out for you?
04:05:43 How's the majority of your of your fucking life? How's that? How's that? How's your leftover eating situation? How's that?
04:05:50 Um, it's it's on the upswing
04:05:54 I mean, uh
04:05:57 Well, I never I never was homeless, you know, I'll give him that much. It never was never was fully homeless
04:06:02 Uh, so, you know, lucky me. Don't see what that has to do with my fucking
04:06:07 criticisms of the way burning donut chooses to run his fucking art pr campaign
04:06:13 Don't really see the relevant there. Sorry. He was homeless wouldn't have wished that on him doesn't really make
04:06:19 Yeah
04:06:21 Hate him. What else did he say? They're like there was more going on there. Uh, uh, uh
04:06:26 Hot dog goo
04:06:27 It was just more like weirdly specific insults that no one cares about and aren't effective whatsoever
04:06:33 Him saying like him saying like I have more subs, but for no good reason gets more views
04:06:40 Which is like it's not even true. I looked
04:06:43 So something about like some kind of point about how my audience isn't as engaged as his which like sorry. Are you the police?
04:06:50 Yeah, um
04:06:52 Munchy you have 700 subs
04:06:54 You suck. Yes, which I don't even like I don't
04:06:58 Make youtube videos as a profession. That's not what I'm about
04:07:01 This will come up again. This will come up again
04:07:04 But fngr is like is fixated on sub counts and view counts as a measure of a person's worth
04:07:09 Yeah, like yeah, he throws that out there a bunch as opposed to patreon money
04:07:14 Which is more because it shows how much people like your stuff. Yeah, I mean, it's not like exactly
04:07:20 Yeah, it's yeah, yeah, but like it's definitely more of one than like a sub count. I mean look at sigh for example
04:07:26 Yeah, exactly
04:07:28 Look inside your big revelation of leaving pony was to become a pokey tuber
04:07:33 Fresh and original benny, you know because brony is dying benny
04:07:37 You lift mlp to get about half the views that tbb ap used to make not just that but
04:07:44 I mean
04:07:45 Does it even need saying that he just doesn't know what he's talking about?
04:07:48 Yeah, like he just obviously just does not understand like he thinks that people can only exist on youtube
04:07:54 And there's nothing else one could possibly do
04:07:57 Yeah, yeah, yeah like like the thing the things off the things off youtube are not even like entering into this dialogue for him
04:08:05 Like they're not relevant. They just don't even exist in his mind. Yeah. Does he even know
04:08:12 That you have made a comic before does he know that?
04:08:15 Who knows? Who knows?
04:08:18 Like there are creative aspirations outside of youtube. I'm sorry if that's a news flash to you
04:08:25 But there are there are things you can do outside of making youtube videos
04:08:30 well
04:08:32 God
04:08:34 It's really frustrating. It's really frustrating because he just it's like it's like trying to like explain don't touch a stove to a child
04:08:42 Yeah, they don't understand but why though. Yeah, well
04:08:47 It'll you'll try it and you'll see and then he tries it, but he still doesn't get it
04:08:53 And the way he calls you bunny benny is the most disgusting. Benny is creepy. It's creepy
04:08:57 It's super creepy gross and like he's trying to be like
04:09:01 He's trying to be like demeaning about it and it's like just makes me
04:09:05 Sweat just make it just makes me feel feel dirty
04:09:10 Like he's it's so it's so gross. He's like such a gross disgusting person. He's
04:09:17 Really like offensively just unpleasant. Ben. This is proto mario. He has 500k subs entertaining guy
04:09:24 Poketuber his average views today are 10k. That's two percent benny
04:09:29 Which is okay for milk, but not so much for youtube
04:09:32 That's your big breakaway benny going from mlp to pokemon with your staggering dead dry boring thumbnails those numbers
04:09:42 What's what's he what's what's wrong with my thumbnails?
04:09:45 What yeah, they're clear and concise and convey what the video is like look at fucking look at this guy's thumbnails
04:09:53 His these views are his thumbnails are a fucking nightmare. They are in yeah, they can't even read them
04:09:59 You can't read them
04:10:00 They just have like a bunch of photographs and like drawing like it's too small to even read like it doesn't even read
04:10:06 My fucking thumbnails are designed to read well
04:10:09 This guy doesn't know and and and not only fucking that but the shit he said before that where it was like it was like
04:10:17 Can we just replay it can you just go back like a little bit so I can just fucking see that again the proto mario bit
04:10:23 Yeah, yeah the other proto. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just like just like
04:10:27 The fact that he again again. He just does not understand views
04:10:32 He just doesn't understand that that's not what you do tvb ap used to make
04:10:37 Not just that but see this ben. This is proto mario. He has 500k subs entertaining guy
04:10:43 Poketuber his average views today are 10k. That's two percent benny
04:10:48 Which is okay for milk, but not so much for youtube. That's your big breakaway benny. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay first of all
04:10:55 He makes it seem like leading t-bep and going to pokemon
04:11:00 Well, okay first of all, that's not even what happened
04:11:02 But even if that word to have been what happened like like that's what that's what that's what happened in his mind
04:11:08 Yeah, that's not
04:11:10 That's just not what it is on any level on any level
04:11:17 Hey, you there
04:11:21 You thought that that was a good business decision because as previously stated that's not what you
04:11:26 And even if it was strictly for money
04:11:28 It wasn't it wasn't for money. You didn't do that for money. It's just because you wanted to do it
04:11:34 It wasn't it would have been smarter to say with pony. Yeah
04:11:37 No one doubts that
04:11:39 Yeah, um
04:11:41 and I mean it's just
04:11:42 I don't I don't even I really don't even know what to say about it. Like it's just so missed. I mean
04:11:48 I mean, I don't
04:11:49 I don't know what
04:11:52 Like yeah, like
04:11:54 but like
04:11:55 Here's the thing like he's he's he's saying all this like, you know
04:11:58 Oh, like I've clearly fucked up like I've clearly fucked up so much and like
04:12:03 And like oh, I made such a terrible decision
04:12:05 But like it worked out for me and like I fucking make more on patreon now than I ever have and like my fucking
04:12:12 Shit has like like shit has gotten better for me and like
04:12:16 I consider everything I've done to like like I see it as like like I've really succeeded at what I set out to do
04:12:22 Like I've really made good progress towards what I wanted to do
04:12:25 And like the fact that he just like frames it all as the exact opposite of that
04:12:30 Just just what am I even supposed to say to that?
04:12:33 Just like no, I I just wrong wrong and act like incorrect
04:12:38 Wrong like wrong by any metric. Yeah
04:12:41 And like just told just there's there's not even like a basis
04:12:45 There's not even a basis for me to critique that on because it doesn't even get like the basic assumptions of reality, right? Yeah
04:12:53 Holy shit
04:12:55 Should I continue? Yeah
04:12:57 Going from MLP to pokemon with your staggering dead drive
04:13:02 Go ahead and start those numbers did not work here here like move back. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Um
04:13:09 Here
04:13:11 Are you on the thumbnail?
04:13:13 Hold on one fucking second here
04:13:19 Yeah, here I'll reset I'll refresh the pages weird that this keeps happening. Yeah, I guess it wasn't designed to be paused that often
04:13:28 Funny like I think it's explicitly designed to be paused like I thought that was like the point of this
04:13:34 Yeah, but you're like like move the cursor a little bit like like like like move it back and forth a little bit
04:13:42 Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he was strictly coming from you hanging on to everyone else's coattails
04:13:47 So the next time
04:13:50 That's your big breakaway, bennie going from MLP to pokemon with your staggering dead drive boring
04:13:57 Thumbnails those numbers strictly coming from you hanging on to everyone else's coattails
04:14:02 So the next time you look at my videos and go boring
04:14:05 I challenge you to show me your retention to your shitty videos and I bet mine beat the fuck out of yours
04:14:11 By the way, bennie, they don't asking off was the original reason why I turned off the PCP podcast
04:14:16 Nate was working really hard trying to put the show over and then you were there acting like a faggot in the background
04:14:22 See this toilet paper roll. This is your fucking legacy, benn
04:14:26 It's not that I'm not grateful for you giving me a chance when you did bennie, but I ain't nobody's punching bag
04:14:31 Thank you. Fuck you. Bye. Dear lily pete another. I never said anything bad about fngr
04:14:38 Yeah, that rowdy fuckers cop killers. I have no idea what he's talking about
04:14:43 Yeah, and again just to reiterate
04:14:46 We he's not addressing the video. He just does not say what's wrong with the video
04:14:52 No, wouldn't that make more sense to describe what he has a problem with instead of like he he he's like
04:14:59 He's like describing that we are bad without describing why we're bad
04:15:03 Yeah, yeah, yeah
04:15:04 Um, or like what we did to make him think this
04:15:09 He he described like
04:15:11 The only thing that's like slightly like that is how he described that I was like mean to vita
04:15:15 That's the only that's like the only like reason you could give for like no
04:15:17 No, no, no, yeah, yeah, but that wasn't that wasn't even in the video, but at least it was something
04:15:23 At least it was something me. It's just he just like it comes off like he's just dragging me up to try and like prove
04:15:30 That I have failed at something and like that's the point in and of itself
04:15:35 When it's not like I don't know what the point is why now if he's always felt this then why now
04:15:41 I mean the only thing I can think of
04:15:43 Is that he's mad
04:15:45 At me about the fact that I like told him to fuck off on twitter
04:15:49 But like then what was he asking me about on twitter in the first place, you know
04:15:56 Again indescribable he I do not understand this video. It makes no sense
04:16:03 and
04:16:04 Fucking fucking uh talking about talking about how I've like how I'm like writing people's coattails
04:16:09 Like it's not like my fucking nuzlocke's got like crazy promoted or anything
04:16:13 Yeah, like like Nate would retweet them once in a while like when I treat it because he was a big fucking fan of them and love them
04:16:20 Uh, I don't know man. Like what I don't even know what I don't even know how to answer some of these things
04:16:25 Because there are these it's like asking like like it's asking you to explain something that you didn't do
04:16:32 Yeah, like so what am I supposed to say? I just wrong. That was that was not a correct question
04:16:37 Like your accusation is simply untrue and I have no other response. Yeah
04:16:42 Um, I like you're just misinformed sir
04:16:46 I this might be the end of the video about us, but I'm pretty sure that was more
04:16:49 I thought that was more about how I'm like not like I like I like I am just like writing the coattails of digi
04:16:55 I know I think
04:16:57 I think I think we got to that part
04:17:00 First skipping ahead to like the very end
04:17:02 I am I'm skipping around
04:17:05 Skipping through a bunch of lily Pete stuff
04:17:07 wanting to puke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right
04:17:11 Weird I could have sworn there was more but uh, yeah, I guess I was just something
04:17:16 There's some cartoon thing at the end. Like I don't know what yeah, there's some like weird like animation
04:17:21 I guess but it like doesn't yeah, I'm pretty sure it's not relevant to us at all. Yeah
04:17:26 Yeah
04:17:27 Well, that was
04:17:30 That was yeah, that was that was fngrs. That was fngrs big takedown of us where he like
04:17:36 Really fucking put us through the ringer and like put us in our place
04:17:40 He threw us some fucking nostalgia critic tier like like insults that we've all heard a thousand fucking times by now
04:17:47 And then I have no weight or gravitas whatsoever
04:17:50 He threw those at us with no context as to why just for the sake of it, I guess just for the mere sake of it
04:17:59 I'll never understand like I don't like I'm sure that if I asked him I'm sure that if I asked him like
04:18:05 Tony
04:18:06 Why were you so mad? What did I do? Like I'm sure that I wouldn't get an answer. Yeah
04:18:13 Yeah
04:18:14 Because what because what what did we do? What could it possibly be?
04:18:18 I I can't even I can't even imagine what he could be mad about because I don't understand him
04:18:23 I mean for you it seems like he's mad at you because vita has some kind of beef with you
04:18:29 So like but for me, it's saying weird
04:18:32 Dispusting human
04:18:35 Jesus
04:18:37 um
04:18:38 The I mean the last thing
04:18:40 The last thing is like there was this other thing that this this some other twitter guy did some guy with like 100 subs
04:18:46 He did like a response to misanthropony
04:18:49 I don't know if you wanted to watch that but he was actually
04:18:51 I actually liked his I thought he like he's kind of like a weird nerd or whatever
04:18:56 He's kind of goofy and like stupid but like I thought he made some good
04:19:00 Shit and I appreciate like even if he's just even just the token effort even just the token even just the fact that someone
04:19:06 That someone else was willing to be like this video makes no sense and is retarded
04:19:12 And uh, you know, it's just nice
04:19:14 It's nice to hear it from an outsider. It's merely just trying to bring reason to do a space or reason
04:19:19 Yeah, yeah, I appreciate I appreciate like this wasn't even like a fan of mine
04:19:23 This was just a guy who saw that video didn't know anything about me
04:19:28 And then was like but wait, here's why this is wrong. Yeah, that's incredible. Yeah, I want to see this
04:19:34 Yeah, did you have you seen this before? No, I haven't. Oh, it's so this is youtuber named misanthropony
04:19:41 He does all sorts of pony related content and from what I've seen it's
04:19:49 I mean his content is okay, I guess
04:19:53 But at the same time I would be lying if I said it left any kind of impact on me
04:20:00 But anyway, recently he did a response this group of people they call themselves the procrastinators or something
04:20:06 Basically, they were skeptical of a situation keyframe found herself in a few years back
04:20:12 Now I'm gonna get something out of the way
04:20:15 I have expressed this taste in keyframes content
04:20:19 Particularly the one review I saw her do with golden fox
04:20:23 However, I am willing to let that slide in the face of more serious issues
04:20:30 Basically a few years ago keyframe had to go fund me. I believe
04:20:35 Started because she was in an abusive household
04:20:38 Ben saint from
04:20:42 Procrastinators
04:20:43 Said in a recent video that he denied this and felt it was an attempt for keyframe to get fame via dr. Wolff
04:20:50 Wolf now I never denied that's not quite what I said, but whatever
04:20:56 however
04:20:58 The best argument against something is a bad one for it misanthropony
04:21:04 At least that's what I would say if misanthropony actually offered up an argument
04:21:11 By a timely point is about 12 minutes into a 20 minute video. So already the majority of the video is done
04:21:20 However
04:21:21 misanthropony doesn't really even debunk ben saint's idea
04:21:27 Instead he just sort of
04:21:30 Complains that he had the idea to begin with instead of debunking. Yeah
04:21:35 He then talks about how hard it is for him to think back about it
04:21:39 Not ignore the fact that someone was actually abused. It was hard for him to think about fact here
04:21:45 I am going to create a very scientific
04:21:48 Yeah, I like it on this whiteboard based off f from jozine. Um, you see this is this is a circle
04:21:55 This is how important it was that she was being abused or whatever
04:21:59 This is how important it was that it made the santhropony uncomfortable. It all was this. Yeah, I fucking like this guy
04:22:05 Yeah, yeah, yeah
04:22:07 Seriously, he said he had a hard time thinking about it. Really
04:22:12 Really
04:22:15 That is actually what he said go to the video. It's in the description if you don't believe me. That is literally what he said
04:22:23 Yeah, now I will give misanthropony the benefit of the doubt and assume that was just bad wording
04:22:30 but
04:22:32 That doesn't escape the fact that it was still at best bad wording at best
04:22:38 Yeah
04:22:40 He mentions doesn't excuse it frame. No, no doesn't prove anything
04:22:46 Anecdotes aren't real evidence misanthropony
04:22:49 For that matter. He claims he has all this evidence and you want to know how much of it he shows in the video
04:22:56 Zero
04:22:59 Not a bit
04:23:02 He just assumes that I should know you have evidence
04:23:05 and actually having evidence
04:23:08 Are two very very different things
04:23:13 And considering how there were people who were around that didn't see the proof such as shelly d for instance
04:23:20 Should at least bring up the fact that you need to show proof at the very very least
04:23:26 He then goes on to spout
04:23:30 Fake humbleness
04:23:33 Guys
04:23:34 He's talking about bad guy. Yeah, oh
04:23:41 The status quo is always right and I've accept that
04:23:44 people
04:23:45 Who have told me that they're right
04:23:48 are right
04:23:50 You know, this guy's fucking red pills fuck. You have a reasonable trusted humanity
04:23:55 And video like a little shit with misanthropony threatening physical violence
04:24:01 Upon ben saint. Yeah
04:24:04 Right, it's to kick ben saint in the balls
04:24:08 That's what it comes down to
04:24:10 Uh misanthropony. I don't think you understand this
04:24:14 But assault is illegal
04:24:16 Okay, we got everyone got that down
04:24:20 And even I at my most hyperbolic don't condone assault
04:24:25 Because it's illegal
04:24:27 And should be illegal before anyone brings up my position on drug war assault should remain illegal. Okay
04:24:35 For that matter, this isn't even a time where I'd be willing to say yes, their words
04:24:41 Count for violence. This isn't like ben saint was saying I'm going to commit violence against you
04:24:48 No, you know what he just said
04:24:52 I'm kind of skeptical about this one situation involving keyframe
04:24:57 That's it
04:25:00 And it's just it's just good that it's good that like someone who doesn't know the situation can like come away with the correct impression
04:25:07 Like in spite of in spite of misanthropony trying to like confuse it as best you can
04:25:12 Yeah
04:25:14 That's what this is
04:25:17 For that matter you guys remember what I said about emotional manipulation
04:25:23 Because people like misanthropony
04:25:25 Are that ideology taken to an extreme?
04:25:30 You are wrong
04:25:32 Because I feel like you are wrong and people are telling me that you are wrong. Therefore you are wrong
04:25:39 And when I ask him
04:25:41 When anyone asked him
04:25:43 Why is he wrong?
04:25:45 misanthropony does not have an answer
04:25:48 He just wants to drum up sympathy and he wants to make it so
04:25:53 Oh, you'll feel horrible if you think you're wrong
04:25:57 You'll feel horrible if you think I'm wrong
04:26:00 When if his arguments were solid, he'd just have to say here's the proof as to why you're wrong
04:26:06 Now shut up. He didn't do that. He didn't show any proof
04:26:10 He just sort of said this was a delicate issue
04:26:16 And then they will preside any fucking reason this shouldn't have convinced anyone
04:26:21 I'd love I'd love to see something
04:26:23 Like I'd love to have come away from that with like a real idea of like exactly what happened
04:26:29 So I could have responded to it in a reasonable way
04:26:33 All right, and everyone go subscribe to that guy. Yeah, go subscribe to f from jozine linked. He's a pretty cool guy
04:26:41 Yeah, yeah, I like him
04:26:44 Maybe he should be I wonder I think I think he does I don't think he's just like a pony guy
04:26:50 I'm pretty sure he just like talks about whatever
04:26:53 The only advice you could possibly give was I'm not on the realm to give advice because it's not like I'm like teaching him anything
04:26:58 But I would just say you don't need to always be on camera and that's pretty much it
04:27:03 Yeah more more concise, I guess
04:27:06 But uh, I don't know. I think I think I think he's got I think yeah
04:27:10 Um, I mean, I know I'm biased because he's like agreeing with me and like defending me
04:27:14 But like I thought yeah, but I thought he made his points pretty I thought he made his points pretty reasonably
04:27:19 Yeah, we're the people who are like thinking cognitively
04:27:25 Cognizant we heard the old who are cognizant at all. It's good. It's good when some cognition can can occur and like be evident
04:27:33 Uh, that's not always the case. No as we've seen as we've seen today here on frog fractions, too
04:27:41 Feels so good. Now, why don't we finish frog fractions, too? And you know that guys this has been too
04:27:48 This has been t-bap. This has been this has been t-bap. Um, two best brothers frog fractions, too
04:27:54 Yeah, right if I could stop killers. I hope you enjoyed
04:27:58 Uh, this and we'll see you next week. I forget. I forget what you said. I'll see you next time with frog fra- with rowdy fuckers cop killers

04:28:29 Oh, yeah before yeah, yeah, um, I finally blocked fngr because my friend died and I tweeted about it that I was like sad and like
04:28:38 You know, it's sad that someone died
04:28:40 And fucking fngr of all people is like fuck. I'm sorry, man
04:28:43 So I just blocked him because like fuck you trying to come in here and give me your condolences
04:28:47 Because that was the first time I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure that was the first time he talked to you after that video, right?
04:28:52 It was the yeah, yeah, nothing else had been said
04:28:55 Nothing else has been said so he makes that video kind of a fucking puke full of crap awful awful
04:29:02 While having no like, you know, act later that didn't affect us at all
04:29:06 Just just making like a bitter like vitriolic screed against me for no discernible reason
04:29:12 And then trying to act like and then offering condolences to me because someone I know died
04:29:17 Get fucking disgusting get absolutely fucked you
04:29:22 You fucking vile creature. He is a fucking vile creature vile very vile. Uh, so yeah, uh
04:29:31 That was important but later investigator have a fucking tater
