00:00:00 The great thing about the ancient alien theory is the fact that we can compare modern achievements with stories from our ancient past.
00:00:10 And so if today we're able to create a two-headed dog with six legs,
00:00:18 is it possible that a similar creature existed thousands of years ago?
00:00:24 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the PCP.
00:00:34 I'm the best guy ever and welcome to my unidentified podcast. No one knows what it is. I am here with Tom Oliver.
00:00:44 Aliens built the pyramids. They genetically engineered us human beings. They crashed in Roswell.
00:00:51 We use their down ship to create microprocessors, and that's why Intel is the thing.
00:00:57 Alienware computers are actually alienwares.
00:01:01 The proof is in the pudding. Hippocrit is here.
00:01:04 Nate.
00:01:09 Wait, you said something. Cut the whole podcast out. I made a mistake with what I said.
00:01:16 I was going to make a joke, but I said the whole thing wrong three times in a row. Just kill me.
00:01:21 Cut myself out of the podcast and put a beep boop noise.
00:01:26 We'll get back to that. Lethal Aurora Mage is here.
00:01:30 Do we have ghost aliens? That is the question.
00:01:34 I think they might be the same thing. And of course, Munchy wears tiny hats.
00:01:38 Guys, I'm in a signal from outer space right now. Oh my God, I'm going to type down wow on my paper because they like World of Warcraft.
00:01:45 This is the wow signal, but that's World of Warcraft now.
00:01:50 We really have evolved since we were those aliens long ago.
00:01:55 Well, everybody, we're talking about aliens today.
00:01:58 The most powerful race on the planet Earth.
00:02:01 The most benevolent beings with their compassionate eyes.
00:02:05 I am Paradot. I love Steven Universe. I am everything to me.
00:02:12 I just want to go on record as saying my absolute favorite emoji is without a doubt the alien face emoji.
00:02:17 I copyright it. It is my property. Every time you use it, you owe me one American dollar.
00:02:23 Let's actually check out these Urban Dictionary definitions.
00:02:27 We've got a double for you, everybody. So number one, we've got aliens.
00:02:33 Wait, did we explain what the PCP is?
00:02:37 Oh, we totally forgot. Thank you for reminding me.
00:02:39 So the PCP, everybody, is a podcast of a bunch of internet content creators who got together and they just have fun.
00:02:45 They just love goofing. And we love aliens. We love aliens.
00:02:49 It's a big proponent of alien culture.
00:02:51 We feel more related to aliens than you fucking disgusting, normie humans out there listening to it.
00:02:57 So that's why we decided to talk about our spirit brethren today.
00:03:01 People always say, does morality come from within the soul of man?
00:03:04 Or does it come from a higher being? Or does it come from God?
00:03:07 Or the third option, did it come from aliens? That's what I want to get into.
00:03:11 Okay, but here, Urban Dictionary, give us some information about what the fucking aliens even is.
00:03:16 Okay, here we go. Top definition, people from outer space.
00:03:20 Generally, peace, loving, and wise, they've come to Earth because we've got Velcro and they love that shit.
00:03:26 That's the thing. The example is terrible, so I'm not going to read it.
00:03:31 But then our other definition here is UFO.
00:03:34 Okay, UFO, abbreviation for unidentified flying object.
00:03:38 The USAF defines a UFO as anything that relates to any airborne object,
00:03:43 which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features,
00:03:47 does not conform to any currently known aircraft or missile type,
00:03:51 or which cannot be identified as a familiar object.
00:03:54 Okay, well thanks point, Dexter, for the textual definition.
00:03:58 So the United States Air Force just confirmed the existence of aliens if they have a definition on record.
00:04:04 Is that true? How so?
00:04:06 Because you just said the USAF, right?
00:04:10 If they have a definition for it, they must acknowledge that it's a thing that can happen.
00:04:15 If it can happen, that means it's real.
00:04:18 If it can happen, it is real.
00:04:20 It sounds like...
00:04:22 I watched Ancient Aliens, alright?
00:04:24 I know exactly how you have to do this logical chain of how aliens work.
00:04:28 I never once watched Ancient Aliens.
00:04:31 Yeah, like when in Google Docs, when I type teleport, it corrects it as if it's not a word,
00:04:37 but when I type aliens, it's a word.
00:04:39 Therefore, it exists.
00:04:41 Oh shit!
00:04:42 It's in the database, it's real, probably built by aliens, manipulating us right now.
00:04:55 I fucked it up again.
00:04:57 Oh, there's a static that cut into my...
00:05:00 I'm back now, I'm fine.
00:05:02 Aliens are interrupting your thought process.
00:05:05 They're scrambling my brain, making me not funny, and the audience is just hearing static, so it's fine.
00:05:11 Do you don't want to let you talk?
00:05:14 Let's just cut to the chase here. Aliens are real.
00:05:17 Okay, okay, they may be real. Have they visited the Earth?
00:05:19 Yes, they've seen Steven Universe.
00:05:22 Oh, yeah.
00:05:24 The sneakle are here, and they're going to fuck us up.
00:05:27 My opinion is that the aliens are objectively real, but the only ones we've seen have been really funny,
00:05:35 and the other ones that we haven't seen since.
00:05:40 We're just waiting for that.
00:05:42 The fact of the matter is that aliens are real, and they're illegal, and they're crossing the border every day,
00:05:49 and Trump's going to fix that shit. Stop making fun of him.
00:05:54 Is alien like a mean to use as a word? I don't know, is that like a negative implication there?
00:05:59 No, it's not.
00:06:01 Because now it's undocumented immigrants, you know how that's changed?
00:06:04 Yeah, they keep changing it.
00:06:05 I guess it's just like Judge Collins talked about the softening of language every time.
00:06:09 It's only the legal alien that's sick, because an alien in that terms is just someone who is living in the country,
00:06:14 but it's not a resident of that country.
00:06:16 Like Phil Collins' famous song, Legal Alien.
00:06:19 Like all of the fucking aliens that crashed here in Roswell are now being held prisoner in Area 51, as we reverse-
00:06:26 I think they were a diet of old age.
00:06:27 I think they were forcibly bred to reproduce so we could continue to study them.
00:06:30 I wouldn't put it past us.
00:06:32 Maybe aliens are like space elves, and they're undying. It's very possible.
00:06:37 Who do you think produces more precom? Alph or ET?
00:06:42 Alph.
00:06:44 Definitely Alph.
00:06:45 Alph gets around.
00:06:47 No.
00:06:49 I mean, have you seen his nose? I mean, come on.
00:06:52 That's not his nose.
00:06:56 So the universe is really big, right? It's really, really, really big.
00:07:02 I don't know about that.
00:07:03 It's really, really, really fun.
00:07:04 Okay, well take my word for it.
00:07:06 I've looked into this a bit.
00:07:08 I've watched Star Trek. It's hilarious.
00:07:10 I've seen that. It's really goofy out there.
00:07:13 Okay, because the universe is so big, and human beings have explored and can see such a tiny little baby-sized percentage of it.
00:07:21 So as the discussion goes, as the argument goes, there's so many opportunities for life out in the cosmos.
00:07:29 When you get into this stuff, immediately religious people think that there's something magical and special about Earth
00:07:35 that God created man in his own image and made us here and shaped the universe around us.
00:07:39 So yeah, God created the entire fucking universe to house one little basically insignificant planet here
00:07:45 that nobody gives a fuck about that we can't do anything with, just like a goof.
00:07:48 Well, I'd say that was the inefficient answer.
00:07:50 I don't think anyone here is doubting the possibility of humanoid aliens in the universe in general.
00:07:57 I just want to make the point for the listeners out there.
00:07:59 For any doubting Thomases, they will be deleted as will Tom from this podcast immediately.
00:08:05 This was my topic idea! You can't delete me!
00:08:08 That's true.
00:08:11 Did you know-
00:08:12 Actually, the opposite of a doubting Thomas. You're the woke Thomas.
00:08:15 I'm taking that term back. I'm fucking- I'm suing the federal government to get custody of that term.
00:08:23 Bastards.
00:08:24 Again, what were you saying?
00:08:26 Here's an article thing that I read, and I have no idea whether it's true.
00:08:30 But did you know, guys, that there's life in our solar system on Mars?
00:08:36 In, like, the under-under-the-surface oceans on Mars, people have found small little bacteria.
00:08:41 It's much of getting invaded by aliens right now.
00:08:43 Stop! Please!
00:08:44 Is that what's happening?
00:08:46 Please stop them! Please!
00:08:51 They're trying to- they're doing everything they can to disrupt this podcast so that the word does not get out,
00:08:55 that we're under their shit, and we know they're among us every fucking day.
00:08:58 Yeah, I was about to- I was about to announce something, but, you know, I was interrupted,
00:09:02 and now my brain is, like, scrambled, like I remember what I was gonna say.
00:09:05 Here, maybe this image will help you out, check out this.
00:09:07 I'm just a thing.
00:09:08 Something cool.
00:09:09 That's a good one.
00:09:10 Just so everyone knows, we are constantly, like, in our chat dumping more alien images
00:09:15 just to keep us woke as possible while we're at it.
00:09:18 I just Google searched funny cartoon aliens, and I'm just posting all of the cool images
00:09:22 that I found scrolling down at Google Image Search.
00:09:24 Maybe we'll remember to post a link to all of these images.
00:09:27 No, you can play along. Just type in funny cartoon aliens and just laugh at them while we're laughing.
00:09:31 Yeah.
00:09:32 All right, continue.
00:09:37 Okay, you know, Tom posts a picture here that makes it a good argument.
00:09:41 It's like, okay, if aliens weren't real and didn't visit Earth, how did they build everything in prehistoric Earth?
00:09:48 Why were they responsible for every major achievement of humanity, you know, up to the invention of the cuckold?
00:09:54 The blocks of the pyramids cannot be carried by men on their shoulders.
00:09:58 They just couldn't do it. It was just too heavy.
00:10:00 You really think that a bunch of fucking people dragged multiple ton blocks across the sand?
00:10:06 No, aliens did it. The amount of precision that the pyramids are built with, you can't even do that today with modern technology.
00:10:16 Do you think a bunch of life, do you think a bunch of fucking monkeys with sticks can make that shit?
00:10:24 Do you think a bunch of Minecraft characters built those?
00:10:28 The true facts all point to aliens just being really swole and they carried them on their shoulders because they're really strong.
00:10:37 And then instead, they didn't have spaceships, they just jumped away from our planet to another one.
00:10:42 They just had very strong legs.
00:10:44 Okay, let me ask you this. Does anyone have any good reason to believe that aliens were actually on Earth ever?
00:10:51 Is there any justification other than like, oh, they must have been here.
00:10:55 Google search the Anunnaki, god damn it.
00:10:58 What is it?
00:11:00 The Anunnaki that shit's fucking real, dude.
00:11:03 All of the ancient creation myths are actually just misinterpretations of alien visitation.
00:11:09 Look, watch ancient aliens. It lays it all out. Shit's fucking real as fuck, alright?
00:11:14 Everything that happened in the world is aliens.
00:11:17 Have you seen all of ancient aliens? I don't know how much there is.
00:11:20 I've seen quite a bit.
00:11:22 And I've seen it all.
00:11:24 Is it always that guy? Is it that one dude?
00:11:26 It's not always that guy. You know what the interesting thing is?
00:11:28 Okay, I'm gonna blow your fucking mind right now.
00:11:31 This is how I know that ancient aliens is legit.
00:11:34 Alright, so I just linked...
00:11:36 No, no, no. Listen, this is some real fucking shit right now, okay?
00:11:40 This is a conspiracy theory that's gonna blow your mind to shit.
00:11:43 Alright, so everybody knows what the ancient aliens guy looks like, right?
00:11:46 Everybody knows that.
00:11:47 Alright, people at home, play along with me here.
00:11:49 Alright, you're about to have your fucking brain expanded.
00:11:53 You're gonna be like, blow.
00:11:55 You're about to reach level 7 Christ consciousness.
00:11:58 Exactly, this is good. You're gonna get at least two levels of Christ consciousness.
00:12:02 Expansion here.
00:12:04 So, Google, ancient aliens guy, go to images, put that in your brain.
00:12:09 Now, go to Google Images and Google search Babylon 5.
00:12:14 Alright, that's a television show, okay?
00:12:16 Babylon 5 Centauri.
00:12:19 And then, be amazed that the Centauri aliens look exactly like the ancient aliens guy.
00:12:25 It's the exact same thing. They're literally the same.
00:12:28 Oh no.
00:12:29 These fucking guys.
00:12:30 Is that a fucking coincidence? No, it's not!
00:12:33 I even see pictures of him posing with pictures of them.
00:12:36 He's trying to tell us something. He knows shit, alright?
00:12:41 Ancient aliens is 100% legit.
00:12:44 Babylon 5 is a realistic account of aliens and how it's going to go down in the future.
00:12:50 This shit is real. It's all fucking real.
00:12:53 He's not the only one. Look at this shit.
00:12:55 I'm seeing some major similarities here.
00:12:57 Kim Jong-un or whatever.
00:12:59 They're among us, dude.
00:13:01 And you know what the fun in Babylon 5?
00:13:04 The Centauri are the closest alien species to humans because they live in Alpha Centauri.
00:13:10 They're their star. That's how it's good.
00:13:13 It's all coming together, dude. The shit is fucking real.
00:13:16 I mean, mathematically speaking, they're the most likely to be the real aliens
00:13:20 that fucking steal my parking spot every day at work.
00:13:24 These are other fuckers.
00:13:26 What are you gonna do, man?
00:13:28 Sometimes you just gotta let the aliens have their way before they fucking kill you.
00:13:33 My favorite alien is the guy from Doctor Who.
00:13:38 He wears a suit.
00:13:40 No, not that guy.
00:13:42 He wears a suit and if you look at him, you're like, oh, god, it's a scary guy.
00:13:47 But then if you turn around, if you're not looking at him, you completely forget his entire existence
00:13:51 and the fact that he was just there.
00:13:53 And if you turn around, you're like, oh, my god, it's a scary guy.
00:13:55 And then you turn around again, you're like, wait a minute.
00:13:57 Why am I here? Oh, my god, it's a scary guy.
00:14:00 Oh, no, there's nothing there.
00:14:02 Ben Sane.
00:14:03 Exactly.
00:14:05 Mike, if anyone knows that Doctor Who alien, that's like a real cool one.
00:14:09 Wait, is that the one that's the one that teleports?
00:14:11 Like the weeping statues or whatever?
00:14:13 No, no, no.
00:14:14 Those are like angels or something.
00:14:16 I'm gonna type in Doctor Who.
00:14:18 The Europeans immediately jump in and correct us on our lack of Doctor Who lore knowledge.
00:14:24 My favorite aliens are the alien kids.
00:14:27 And the reason I like them so much is their debut album, Alien Rap,
00:14:31 songs that lie from Planet Lump by the alien kids,
00:14:34 where they wrap it up their alien food and the ways which they process it.
00:14:38 Also about education reform.
00:14:40 Yeah, I'm with you on that.
00:14:44 My favorite aliens, I'm quite partial to, you know that blue guy,
00:14:47 who like a whole narrative was built around him from that like,
00:14:50 I'm blue, I'm blue, I'm blue, I'm blue.
00:14:52 No, I was gonna say that.
00:14:54 Oh, you like, okay, well that guy's got like a name and a lore and a huge back story
00:14:59 and like all kinds of tie-ins.
00:15:01 Can we just go on record though that as cool as that guy is,
00:15:05 the best blue aliens to ever exist are the aliens from Interstellar 555.
00:15:10 Come on.
00:15:11 I do love them intensely.
00:15:13 They got a bit more depth to them, all right?
00:15:16 There's a lot of fan and lore around this blue dude,
00:15:19 but I like going direct to the source with the canon lore.
00:15:24 That's where I like to live.
00:15:27 Yeah, Gib, go on.
00:15:28 I was trying to remember the name of this 80s alien kid movie,
00:15:31 kid alien movie, and I can't remember what it is.
00:15:34 It's like a group of kids and there's a cool one and there's a nerdy one
00:15:38 and he has a computer and he types on the computer
00:15:41 and he makes like an anti-gravity bubble
00:15:43 and then they build a spaceship and they use the computer and make a bubble
00:15:46 and they go into space because the kid was like getting dreams of like alien technology
00:15:51 and then they go into space and then they get to the spaceship
00:15:53 and the aliens does a goofy fucking plastic weirdo in a suit
00:15:56 and they have a fun time and then the alien's dad comes back
00:15:59 and he said, have you been talking to the humans again?
00:16:01 And he's like, I'm sorry dad, but in aliens,
00:16:03 so you don't know that that's exactly what they're saying,
00:16:05 but it's probably, it's like you can infer.
00:16:07 And then the kids go home and what the fuck is that movie?
00:16:10 I really like it.
00:16:11 Home Alone 3, Journey to Big Water, I don't know.
00:16:14 Guys, I have something really fucking important.
00:16:16 Go search media aliens and you will see some crazy fucking images.
00:16:21 Do that to viewers.
00:16:23 Media aliens.
00:16:25 You see a picture of Bill O'Reilly?
00:16:27 You see like a movie toaster?
00:16:29 I don't see Bill O'Reilly.
00:16:31 Cowboys and aliens.
00:16:32 Dude, the aliens from Cowboys and Aliens are so fucking scary
00:16:35 because they're with cowboys.
00:16:37 I like this extreme UFOs and aliens ones.
00:16:40 Okay, well, this is all great and all,
00:16:42 but I wanted to ask you guys a specific question.
00:16:45 And it's that, okay, if aliens are real and they visit Earth,
00:16:49 should they be allowed to kill human beings?
00:16:52 Should they be allowed to wipe out humanity
00:16:54 if they deem that we are inferior and not worthy
00:16:57 of ascending to a galactic civilization?
00:16:59 Explorers, 1985.
00:17:01 Okay, that's the one, that's the one.
00:17:03 Anyway, why would they be able to?
00:17:09 What if they are able to assess that humanity will advance
00:17:12 to some like stage where it could be a threat?
00:17:15 Like, you know, like in Mass Effect, right?
00:17:18 The Reapers may or may not be some sort of like white blood cell
00:17:21 that wipes out, you know, like civilizations that advance too far
00:17:25 or something like in Die Buster and Gun Buster.
00:17:29 That same idea is present where like humanity is growing
00:17:31 and reaching out to the stars and whatnot
00:17:33 and the space monsters are thought to maybe be some sort of like
00:17:36 white blood cell that wipes out like civilizations
00:17:39 when they get to advanced.
00:17:41 And they don't really explore why that happens,
00:17:43 but perhaps one possible reason could be too much stuff happening.
00:17:47 Out in the real world, could fuck some shit up.
00:17:50 Could maybe, I don't know, cause problems.
00:17:53 I'm thinking from the perspective of humanity,
00:17:57 fuck that entirely, that's just a cock mentality
00:18:00 to just bend over and not expand throughout the universe
00:18:03 because oh, maybe would kill some things and do some bad stuff.
00:18:06 Fuck you.
00:18:08 I mean, it would be very hypocritical of them considering
00:18:10 that they're out in space and now killing stuff.
00:18:13 Well, it's, you know, it really is just like
00:18:16 the whole anti-spiral argument from Gern-Lagan
00:18:18 that the anti-spirals-
00:18:19 What's this about white blood cells?
00:18:21 I mean, seriously.
00:18:23 The aliens have green blood.
00:18:25 This doesn't even make sense to them.
00:18:27 They're about the black blood cells.
00:18:29 But, yeah, so like the anti-spirals and Gern-Lagan,
00:18:34 like their whole deal is they stopped like the spiral guys.
00:18:37 You know, the spiral just represents like evolution
00:18:39 and growth of humanity and whatnot.
00:18:41 And the anti-spirals like they deliberately put a cap on themselves
00:18:44 so they cannot go any higher and they gave themselves the job
00:18:47 to like squash, you know, like anything out there that gets too,
00:18:51 that starts growing too much and could get out of control.
00:18:53 And they were proven wrong and they were doing the bad thing
00:18:56 and it was done.
00:18:57 Well, I mean, to be fair, to be fair,
00:18:59 one of the things I like about Gern-Lagan
00:19:01 is it doesn't actually tell you that they were in fact wrong,
00:19:04 but what it gives you is it-
00:19:05 I don't know.
00:19:06 You got punched in the face pretty good at the end.
00:19:08 He did get punched real hard.
00:19:10 I thought that was definitely some subtextual thing there.
00:19:13 You're not wrong.
00:19:14 A little bit of subtext.
00:19:15 It's clear where the intense lie,
00:19:17 but like it allows a degree of ambiguity
00:19:21 where it is true that the human beings may in fact fuck some shit up,
00:19:25 but I actually prefer that they don't confirm
00:19:27 that everything works out perfectly.
00:19:29 Yes, we agree.
00:19:30 Instead, it leaves you on this note of that everyone like agrees
00:19:33 that like, okay, we are all going to work specifically
00:19:36 to maximize happiness, freedom, and avoid this catastrophic thing
00:19:40 that could come with too much of either of those first ones.
00:19:42 Well, I would not let any aliens fucking tell me what to do
00:19:46 or my buddy's here on earth because that's thought crime.
00:19:50 I think it's bullshit.
00:19:51 You can instead, if you were an alien race
00:19:55 full of advanced technology and you were able to travel
00:19:58 through the stars and all this shit
00:20:00 and you could make some sort of calculated sort of projection
00:20:04 on the future of humanity and you thought that it was going bad.
00:20:08 Instead of being like, well, you guys are going to fuck up
00:20:12 in a couple centuries, so you're dead now.
00:20:14 I'd be like, this is an opportunity to kind of guide this society
00:20:19 towards a better understanding.
00:20:21 I think just the act of interstellar contact
00:20:25 would fundamentally shift the progression
00:20:28 and trajectory of human interest dramatically.
00:20:31 So I think just by being introduced to the concept of aliens
00:20:35 we would change our priorities
00:20:38 and the way society interacts in general, simply from that fact.
00:20:42 And I think it would be hoovan upon aliens
00:20:46 if they thought that we're going bad to use their position
00:20:50 to try and help.
00:20:52 Basically, they need to be the America of the galaxy
00:20:55 and intercede and spread space democracy everywhere
00:20:59 and do nation building.
00:21:01 That's interesting because Star Trek deals, as you know,
00:21:04 with this very issue and it's the Prime Directive.
00:21:07 And of course, in Star Trek First Contact,
00:21:09 the movie based from the next generation
00:21:12 in which they go back in time to the moment where
00:21:15 human beings and Star Trek develop their own warp drive,
00:21:20 which is the technology you really need for faster than light travel
00:21:23 in order to be a force in the galaxy and in the universe
00:21:26 outside of just your own little solar system.
00:21:29 And as soon as they activated their warp drive,
00:21:34 they were detected by some nearby Vulcans
00:21:36 who don't live too far away.
00:21:38 And then they came down and were like,
00:21:40 oh, hey humans, let's be friends now.
00:21:42 And it was through that that they developed the Federation
00:21:45 and grew into Starfleet and all that good stuff
00:21:48 that happened afterward.
00:21:50 So the best case scenario is Star Trek.
00:21:54 Star Trek and Starfleet and all that cool stuff.
00:21:56 That's the best case scenario.
00:21:58 But it is entirely possible that what if the humans
00:22:02 just met the Klingons first or something?
00:22:04 Not even the Klingons, but something even worse,
00:22:06 like the fucking Borg.
00:22:08 And it fucks them up real bad.
00:22:10 And they get whatever kind of bad things happen to them.
00:22:13 I'm not even advocating for anything here.
00:22:15 I'm just expressing alien issues.
00:22:18 Hashtag alien issues.
00:22:20 Relatable alien problems.
00:22:22 Stealing our jobs, crushing the working class, alien issues.
00:22:26 I think it's retarded and stupid
00:22:29 and frankly you should feel bad
00:22:31 for even suggesting anything like that.
00:22:33 Because aliens are probably not going to have any...
00:22:38 Well, I'm not saying they won't at all,
00:22:40 but they might not have any philosophical insights whatsoever.
00:22:43 It's possible they might just be like fucking like a dog or something.
00:22:46 And they'll just be beasts of the land.
00:22:48 No, that's silly.
00:22:50 An alien couldn't get here
00:22:52 without a certain level of development.
00:22:54 Sociological and technological.
00:22:56 I'm not saying that if we meet aliens,
00:22:59 if we meet aliens,
00:23:01 then it's very possible that there are just like thousands of planets
00:23:04 that are just full of just bum-fuck-retard dominant species
00:23:08 that have no real abilities whatsoever.
00:23:11 And so, I don't know.
00:23:14 And even if there is a highly developed species
00:23:18 that gets to us first,
00:23:20 it's not guaranteed that they will have any sort of the same sort of like,
00:23:24 you know, democracy or ideas such as that.
00:23:27 There's absolutely no way to tell that they will have anything
00:23:30 even resembling that whatsoever.
00:23:32 And so, I don't think...
00:23:34 If an alien species does meet us,
00:23:36 there's no way to tell if it will even know what killing is,
00:23:40 because life just might work so different on that planet.
00:23:43 Because, you know, all of our ideas is built on how life is on Earth.
00:23:47 But if there's just some weird fucking crazy planet,
00:23:50 there's no way to know what its needs or wants are,
00:23:53 everything will have needs or wants.
00:23:55 I hear what you're saying,
00:23:57 but I think there are some basic biological foundations
00:24:00 that make a lot of things like life versus death.
00:24:03 Well, life versus death, for example,
00:24:05 I think is a pretty clear cut one
00:24:07 that any alien that advances to the point
00:24:10 where like they can, you know, travel through the stars and whatnot,
00:24:13 I think we'll have some fundamental understanding of like what life is
00:24:16 and probably respect it.
00:24:18 I mean, they might operate in a society that just like works on total enslavement.
00:24:21 Trolls. Trolls.
00:24:23 Or trolls, there you go.
00:24:24 Alternate trolls, yeah.
00:24:26 Were alternative trolls even that different from normal humans?
00:24:29 What were their distinguishing characteristics?
00:24:31 They were super fucking strong.
00:24:33 They had crazy like, like PSI powers.
00:24:36 And they were super fucking violent.
00:24:38 They like killed everyone for like looking at the bad.
00:24:40 And there was a really rigid like, like India caste system.
00:24:44 But then Carcat just like was best friends with Dave.
00:24:46 How come he didn't just like kill Dave?
00:24:48 That was after like, that was after a while.
00:24:51 That was after a lot of homosexual propaganda.
00:24:54 So what you're telling me is hashtag not all trolls.
00:24:57 Yeah, hashtag not all trolls.
00:24:59 Okay, all right, there we go.
00:25:01 Yeah, it's all trolls.
00:25:03 Fuck all trolls.
00:25:05 You can all burn.
00:25:07 Every troll was an MMM.
00:25:09 And fucking one of them had a bullet in them.
00:25:12 You bite the bullet, asshole.
00:25:14 Die.
00:25:16 I'm gonna say yes.
00:25:18 I'm very happy that Homestuck is part of this conversation.
00:25:22 I just want to say that.
00:25:24 I don't really have like a point.
00:25:26 I'm just, I just remembered.
00:25:28 What's your favorite Homestuck alien?
00:25:30 Oh, John Egbert.
00:25:32 Yeah, it's mine as well.
00:25:34 Hey, so, okay.
00:25:36 So does anyone have any personal experience?
00:25:38 Like, has anyone ever come up to you and said like,
00:25:40 check me out of a fucking alien
00:25:42 and then directly annihilated you?
00:25:44 You know, like a story like that.
00:25:46 I'm interested in that sort of thing.
00:25:48 Do you want to know about the story of the alien that got away?
00:25:50 Yes, absolutely.
00:25:52 So when I was a little kid,
00:25:54 I loved, I loved aliens.
00:25:56 I loved space.
00:25:58 I loved science class.
00:26:00 We were talking about like the solar system
00:26:02 and astronomy and all that shit.
00:26:04 And it was really cool.
00:26:06 And I loved science.
00:26:08 Then I was like...
00:26:10 So I was at the carnival.
00:26:14 The carnival was in town.
00:26:16 And so I was,
00:26:18 and I was all about aliens.
00:26:20 And this was back like in 1990,
00:26:22 whatever, old, olden times
00:26:24 before Munchie was even a twinkle in his dad's eye.
00:26:28 And I wasn't a twinkle in my dad's eyes ever since.
00:26:32 Exactly.
00:26:34 He explains everything.
00:26:38 So I'm at this carnival
00:26:40 and I'm playing the games and stuff
00:26:42 and I decide there's this big alien prize.
00:26:44 And I was like, that's what I want.
00:26:46 So it's typical like little green alien
00:26:48 but you were like, I had like a hoodie on
00:26:50 and it was a cool thing.
00:26:52 And I was like, that's what I want.
00:26:54 And I spent all day trying to win this alien prize at this game.
00:26:56 I don't remember what game it was.
00:26:58 And I got it.
00:27:00 And I felt like the coolest guy in the entire world.
00:27:02 It was big.
00:27:04 It was like 18 inches tall.
00:27:06 It was one of those big, hard to get prizes.
00:27:08 You are literally paradigm.
00:27:10 Exactly.
00:27:12 I resonated with that scene a lot.
00:27:14 And this story takes a tragic turn here though.
00:27:16 Because I brought it home
00:27:18 and I brought it to my mom
00:27:20 and my grandmother.
00:27:22 And they're both very religious.
00:27:24 And they thought aliens were the devil.
00:27:26 So they refused to let me have it.
00:27:28 And I was like, no.
00:27:30 I worked for this.
00:27:32 This is the result of my labor.
00:27:34 This taught me a lesson about capitalism
00:27:36 in the world.
00:27:38 How dare you take this from me.
00:27:40 But they bribed me.
00:27:42 They bribed me.
00:27:44 They were like, alright, you capitalist pig.
00:27:46 We will give you
00:27:48 that toy from Lost in Space.
00:27:50 That other space movie that you really like right now.
00:27:52 If you give us this.
00:27:54 And I was like,
00:27:56 But
00:27:58 I won this and they're like, yes.
00:28:00 But we're going to be the government incentives
00:28:02 giving you things for free.
00:28:04 If you vote
00:28:06 Democrat.
00:28:08 So I voted Democrat.
00:28:10 I got rid of it.
00:28:12 And they made me feel bad because
00:28:14 I thought my soul was going to burn in health forever
00:28:16 for having this alien toy that I won.
00:28:18 And I never saw it again.
00:28:20 And every time I see the alien
00:28:22 wear logo, I'm like,
00:28:24 There he is.
00:28:26 I'm going on to bigger things.
00:28:28 I'm so happy.
00:28:30 I'm CEO of a computer parts company.
00:28:34 We can all just agree
00:28:36 that the little stereotypical
00:28:38 green alien guy with the big ass eyes
00:28:40 is the pinnacle of graphic design.
00:28:42 I agree.
00:28:44 Completely.
00:28:46 Do you guys ever see that post?
00:28:48 There was a post of some photos
00:28:50 of a claimed real photo
00:28:52 of a gray alien with the big
00:28:54 eyes and like, you know, like the small lips
00:28:56 and everything, whatever. And then someone drew over it
00:28:58 quickly as a sketch.
00:29:00 And then again, it was the perfect proportions
00:29:02 of an anime girl.
00:29:04 I'm just saying, dude.
00:29:06 It's a conspiracy.
00:29:08 Anime girls.
00:29:10 I'll try and find it.
00:29:12 I'll try and look for it.
00:29:14 Actually, you know what that exactly reminds me?
00:29:16 There was a chapter in Frank and Fran
00:29:18 where there is a, which is this horror
00:29:20 like monster surgery.
00:29:22 This particular chapter is about
00:29:24 the main character, Matarake Fran.
00:29:26 Matarake Fran.
00:29:28 People just come to her and ask for crazy surgeries
00:29:30 because she's like a god of surgery.
00:29:32 And she can literally do anything, including bring the dead back to life sometimes.
00:29:34 She's just nuts.
00:29:36 In this case,
00:29:38 a famous actress approaches her
00:29:40 and is like, Fran, you're famous, help me.
00:29:42 I, okay, there's a guy
00:29:44 that I love, that I want to marry, date, etc.
00:29:46 The thing is though,
00:29:48 he's only into that fucking 2D shit.
00:29:50 He's not into 3D pig disgusting.
00:29:52 He's not into that.
00:29:54 So what I need you to do,
00:29:56 okay, there's the image he posted.
00:29:58 It's fucking awesome.
00:30:00 So what I need you to do, Fran,
00:30:02 is make me look like a fucking anime girl.
00:30:04 I-R-L.
00:30:06 Do whatever you gotta do
00:30:08 to my fucking body to make it happen.
00:30:10 So like, she like shortens her limbs.
00:30:12 She like, okay, so what she does with her brain
00:30:14 is this is fascinating.
00:30:16 So the anime babes have big old heads.
00:30:18 She replaced her skull
00:30:20 with a gigantic dome thing
00:30:22 and then has her brain suspended
00:30:24 by wires inside the thing
00:30:26 with a big cavern.
00:30:28 I know, it's fucked up.
00:30:30 Like, Frank & Fran is a fucked up series, but I love it.
00:30:32 But the culmination of this
00:30:34 is that slowly, when she becomes more and more anime,
00:30:36 she-
00:30:38 her eyes getting big in all kinds of crazy shit.
00:30:40 Increase anime!
00:30:42 There was just a knob.
00:30:44 Yes, there was a knob.
00:30:46 I'm talking overdrive here.
00:30:48 So like, Nia's to say her body was getting
00:30:50 super fucked up the whole time.
00:30:52 She has to wear a wig now
00:30:54 and she has to do maintenance
00:30:56 on her body and shit because she's a fucking freak now.
00:30:58 But ultimately, what happens is
00:31:00 the guy does start to love her
00:31:02 because she is like his anime babes.
00:31:04 Yeah, he's doing it.
00:31:06 So that happens and then like, I think they either get married
00:31:08 or they're like, I don't know, they're together for a night
00:31:10 and so the guy's laying in bed
00:31:12 and she's like, yeah, I'm coming out to come fuck you
00:31:14 and then as she
00:31:16 as he turns, see her climbing onto the bed,
00:31:18 there's like a light shining from outside the window
00:31:20 and her wig has fallen off
00:31:22 and all her clothes are off and you can see her body
00:31:24 and she just looks exactly like one of these
00:31:26 fucking gray aliens.
00:31:28 Exactly the fucking same.
00:31:30 And it's pretty much like the climax of the whole arc.
00:31:32 You know what this means, dude?
00:31:34 This means that anime is an alien plot
00:31:36 to make us want to fuck them
00:31:38 to make us sympathetic to the alien cause.
00:31:40 Exactly.
00:31:42 The Japanese have been taken over by aliens.
00:31:44 By the way, I just want to say
00:31:46 When did like fucking
00:31:48 Astro Boy come out and shit?
00:31:50 What year was that?
00:31:52 The 30s, the 20s, I can't remember.
00:31:54 The 40s? A while ago.
00:31:56 Not the 20s.
00:31:58 Wasn't that long ago, was it?
00:32:00 No, cause Disney started like the 10s of the 20s
00:32:02 so it was later than that.
00:32:04 I think it was like 50s.
00:32:06 I'd say like the 40s or something.
00:32:08 I don't know, whatever. Around there, around there.
00:32:10 In the background of my audio
00:32:12 is like a very like consistently
00:32:14 weird booming base.
00:32:16 That's just my alien spaceship.
00:32:18 Don't worry about it.
00:32:20 Wait, wait, no, no, no.
00:32:22 Okay, this is some real shit right now, okay?
00:32:24 So, I'm going to drop a conspiracy theory.
00:32:26 Christ conscious of the other level.
00:32:28 Roswell, Roswell at the UFO incident
00:32:30 in mid-1947
00:32:32 at United States Air Force's balloon
00:32:34 crashed in a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico.
00:32:36 Yeah, okay, Wikipedia, keep telling us that.
00:32:38 1947,
00:32:40 Roswell, five years later
00:32:42 in 1952, Astro Boy
00:32:44 is released. Oh my god.
00:32:46 What do you think it is?
00:32:48 Mega Man came out that pod.
00:32:50 Mega Man came out that pod.
00:32:52 Wow. He came out.
00:32:54 Guys, my favorite monster,
00:32:56 no, I'm sorry, my favorite alien
00:32:58 of all time.
00:33:00 I can't decide if it's the Flatwoods monster
00:33:02 or it's the Hopkinsville's goblin.
00:33:04 They're both a goblin.
00:33:06 Those are excellent choices.
00:33:08 Here's the original
00:33:10 depiction of the Flatwoods monster,
00:33:12 by the way.
00:33:14 Okay, I dig it. He's impressive.
00:33:16 Whoa.
00:33:18 This is Waluigi.
00:33:20 He's Waluigi
00:33:22 in a wedding dress.
00:33:24 He just wants to be loved.
00:33:26 No, but the
00:33:28 canonical version is
00:33:30 fucking dope. Look how cool it is.
00:33:32 Holy shit.
00:33:34 Yeah, the Flatwoods monster.
00:33:36 I don't want to go to the Hopkinsville's goblin
00:33:38 because he's just a little fucking guy who's an asshole.
00:33:40 Fuck you.
00:33:42 Dude, do you know
00:33:44 the story of the Hopkinsville's goblin?
00:33:46 I have no idea. Okay, so fucking
00:33:48 basically
00:33:50 these two fucking
00:33:52 in the middle of fucking nowhere,
00:33:54 I forget where, like New Jersey
00:33:56 I think, anywhere.
00:33:58 Anywhere in the world
00:34:00 can happen to you. Okay.
00:34:02 Um, you know, just these fucking
00:34:04 hillbilly fucking retards,
00:34:06 you know, fuck you if you farm.
00:34:08 We're in their house.
00:34:10 And just these fucking, like, little, like, gray,
00:34:12 like, like fucking, like, goblin
00:34:14 fucking asshole, like, sable eyes.
00:34:16 These fucking sable eyes came out.
00:34:18 And they started, like,
00:34:20 popping in and out of windows, like, playing
00:34:22 playing peek-a-boo and shit and, like, making fun of these people.
00:34:24 Making fun of them, they're, like, waiting
00:34:26 shit, being real assholes and
00:34:28 playing pranks. Playing mean pranks.
00:34:30 One of the dads would walk out and, like,
00:34:32 the door was slightly open and he walked in the other room
00:34:34 and then a bucket fell on his head.
00:34:36 Fucking mean. That's what they were.
00:34:38 They're just pranksters. They're just mean people.
00:34:40 They're jerks and fuck you.
00:34:42 Goblin, you're mean.
00:34:44 That's why I like them, because they're really prank.
00:34:46 Alright. That sounds good.
00:34:48 I think Mage was trying to say something before. Mage?
00:34:50 Um, I wasn't,
00:34:52 but I had something in mind, so you maybe
00:34:54 you read my mind. Okay.
00:34:56 Okay.
00:34:58 But first, I have to open the door for my cat.
00:35:00 Sorry.
00:35:02 Well, in the meantime, everyone, I just,
00:35:04 while she's doing that for a second, everyone look at
00:35:06 the greatest alien who ever lived. His name is
00:35:08 Jiren. He is from Dragon Ball Super
00:35:10 and he is canonically stronger than God,
00:35:12 proving that aliens are superior to God
00:35:14 and my God. He is
00:35:16 the best of all time. Also, he looks
00:35:18 exactly like me in every way.
00:35:20 Alright. Alright. He is me.
00:35:22 He is me. Okay. Now we're just projecting.
00:35:24 I'm serious. Look at my newest
00:35:26 video where I'm talking about Star Trek. I put
00:35:28 a picture of him up. It looks exactly like me
00:35:30 wearing my sunglasses. I'm just saying.
00:35:32 Okay, mate. Lay it on us.
00:35:34 Okay. Well, it's not
00:35:36 that big of a story, but, you know, when you
00:35:38 asked, like, if anyone had some sort
00:35:40 of experiences or whatever. So
00:35:42 one time, I was around
00:35:44 10 to 12 or so,
00:35:46 just a little, little Mage
00:35:48 running around late in the evening
00:35:50 without supervision.
00:35:52 I was with a friend at that time. It was
00:35:54 really late in the evening and it was almost
00:35:56 dark. I think, like, the sun was almost
00:35:58 completely down.
00:36:00 We were both going home and we were
00:36:02 near his house and just at the corner
00:36:04 of my eye, I spotted something and then I
00:36:06 looked up at the sky, not, like, directly
00:36:08 above me, but, like, in the horizon.
00:36:10 They were, like,
00:36:12 several lights sort of flashing and something
00:36:14 was flying by before disappearing behind
00:36:16 a building. And
00:36:18 I didn't know
00:36:20 what it was because it was very, well, I mean,
00:36:22 literally a UFO. I'm not
00:36:24 implying it was an alien UFO, but, like...
00:36:26 Sure, sure.
00:36:28 We both saw it and we didn't know what
00:36:30 it was and we ran towards the horizon to see
00:36:32 if we could, you know, see it behind the
00:36:34 building. But by the time we got to the building
00:36:36 it was already out of sight.
00:36:38 And, like,
00:36:40 I told my parents about it and they said,
00:36:42 oh, it could have been a plane or something because
00:36:44 planes have, like, you know, lights on when they're
00:36:46 flying in darkness and stuff.
00:36:48 But, like, it looked too
00:36:50 close to the ground and, like, the lights
00:36:52 were too big and spaced a bit differently
00:36:54 from the planes.
00:36:56 And also, like, the plane had, like,
00:36:58 no real reason to
00:37:00 be flying over there because we didn't
00:37:02 have an airport in my city and we never
00:37:04 saw planes ever fly.
00:37:06 Like, now we do, but back in those
00:37:08 days when I was a little...
00:37:10 We never got planes flying over
00:37:12 our places, like...
00:37:14 You know, Major, I'm glad you brought that up.
00:37:16 What year was this? It was, like,
00:37:18 over ten years ago.
00:37:20 Uh, I think...
00:37:22 Was it on September 11th?
00:37:24 One by any chance?
00:37:26 I'm just saying.
00:37:28 Just checking in.
00:37:30 You know, I was gonna say, depending on how old
00:37:32 you are, but if it's only, like, ten years ago
00:37:34 probably not, it might have been some sort of Russian
00:37:36 thing, possibly, since I know you were
00:37:38 close to there.
00:37:40 And, I mean, it could have been,
00:37:42 like, you think you only got independence
00:37:44 from Russia, like, one year
00:37:46 before I was born.
00:37:48 Oh, really? Are the Russians
00:37:50 aliens?
00:37:52 Basically. Maybe.
00:37:54 Putin is superior to all the life forms on the planet,
00:37:56 so it's probably true. I need to interject here
00:37:58 because I'm on thealiens.wikia.com
00:38:00 fandom page
00:38:02 and I'm looking at the Anunnaki
00:38:04 and I'm in some deep shit right now.
00:38:06 Alright, check it out.
00:38:08 He's in hot water right now.
00:38:10 Check the shit out.
00:38:12 Anunnaki, general information,
00:38:14 whole world,
00:38:16 Aldebaran,
00:38:18 habitat, earth,
00:38:20 body type, vagina humanoid,
00:38:22 sapience level,
00:38:24 super,
00:38:26 behind the scenes
00:38:28 information,
00:38:30 universe, real.
00:38:32 What?
00:38:34 This is some real stuff.
00:38:36 There's a lot of aliens. I mean, we aren't even
00:38:38 gonna get into the aliens that populate the
00:38:40 imaginary universes out there. There's just
00:38:42 too many to go into.
00:38:44 The accompanying picture really sells this whole
00:38:46 thing. It's
00:38:48 some great a shit.
00:38:50 Let me tell you.
00:38:52 Oh, shit.
00:38:54 Wow.
00:38:56 Are those the aliens, those big bearded
00:38:58 motherfuckers? Figures
00:39:00 believe to be the Anunnaki. I believe it's some sort
00:39:02 of sculpture or artistic representation.
00:39:06 Viewers, if you want to understand
00:39:08 what this looks like, if nobody edits this in
00:39:10 cough then. You know what's great though?
00:39:12 The main figure is basically
00:39:14 just, imagine like the
00:39:16 representation of Sargon of Akkad with
00:39:18 googly eyes. That's pretty much what we're looking at right here.
00:39:20 Right. Confirm.
00:39:22 By the way, I just want to point out how amazing
00:39:24 it is that there is a category for
00:39:26 universe, real versus not real.
00:39:28 Think of how many entries there are
00:39:30 in here that depict universes that are
00:39:32 not real. This is why you gotta watch
00:39:34 Ancient Aliens. That's just the beginning of the
00:39:36 fucking rabbit hole for all of this shit.
00:39:38 This is a huge arc. It goes on forever.
00:39:40 Let's just throw out the concept of real versus not real
00:39:42 because that's garbage anyway. It never meant anything.
00:39:44 Once we get that out of the way, then we can
00:39:46 get into the real shit where you are
00:39:48 right now.
00:39:50 When I was a young lad,
00:39:52 I was a very smart boy.
00:39:54 I hadn't actually read The Great Gatsby.
00:39:56 I hadn't actually read The Great Gatsby
00:39:58 but I imagined that I had.
00:40:00 I was a smart
00:40:02 cookie. Anytime
00:40:04 aliens were brought up, I would immediately be
00:40:06 like, that's probably not true.
00:40:08 It's probably like this and that.
00:40:10 Every time my little brothers would
00:40:12 say, whoa, what's that? That's a blink
00:40:14 and light moving across the sky. It's an airplane.
00:40:16 It's not real. It's not alien.
00:40:18 I never had
00:40:20 a time in my childhood
00:40:22 where I believed anything because
00:40:24 I think I was told they weren't real
00:40:26 before I had an experience like
00:40:28 that.
00:40:30 I thought I was real smart
00:40:32 and stuff.
00:40:34 I would love rationalizing things in my head
00:40:36 like, I don't know
00:40:38 how that could be but
00:40:40 let me think of the ways that it could be fake
00:40:42 and I would be that kid.
00:40:44 So that
00:40:46 yeah, I ruined
00:40:48 my little brothers' lives.
00:40:50 They now don't believe.
00:40:52 You know what the most important aliens in my life
00:40:54 are? The aliens from Chicken Little.
00:40:56 Because they were so fucking gay
00:40:58 and they're like, you destroy...
00:41:00 they mess up that guy's fucking baseball
00:41:02 game.
00:41:04 No, I can raise you one better, dude.
00:41:06 You know what the most important aliens
00:41:08 are? The Fleblings
00:41:10 from ChexQuest. Those guys
00:41:12 were fucking around.
00:41:14 Hell yeah.
00:41:16 Do you remember the
00:41:18 weapon you had when you ran out of ammo? You had a spoon
00:41:20 and you scooped them up because they were
00:41:22 goo. I do remember that.
00:41:24 That was some real shit, dude. It was absolutely devastating.
00:41:28 It deeply impacted the way I eat cereal to this fucking day.
00:41:30 I remember something.
00:41:32 My favorite alien
00:41:34 is not whatever I said.
00:41:36 It is, in fact, a very specific
00:41:38 comic
00:41:40 in the Xenomorph
00:41:42 whatever comic universe.
00:41:44 The first movie's pretty good,
00:41:46 but this comic is like the best
00:41:48 alien story ever.
00:41:50 And if you type in Alien Comic
00:41:52 Saxophone, you will see the image I'm talking about.
00:41:56 You've sold me on this.
00:41:58 It's not actually funny. It's just like really cool.
00:42:00 It's the ending of the comic. The saxophone
00:42:02 is like one of the marines is like
00:42:04 precious items and he has to throw it.
00:42:06 I just want to say, just searching Alien Saxophone in general
00:42:08 is leading to fantastic results.
00:42:10 Whoa. That doesn't dope as shit.
00:42:12 Oh my fucking god. This is sick.
00:42:16 He's so aesthetic with that thing.
00:42:18 It looks incredible.
00:42:20 I don't know what that comic is.
00:42:22 I am hard.
00:42:24 But if anyone wants
00:42:26 a really good Alien Xenomorph
00:42:28 comic experience, that is probably
00:42:30 the best one I've ever read and it's probably better
00:42:32 than the movie and I like it a lot.
00:42:34 Shit, dude.
00:42:36 Alien Saxophone.
00:42:38 I like it.
00:42:40 Incredible. Oh my god, guys. I figured it out.
00:42:42 I got our guy.
00:42:44 I got our guy.
00:42:46 I locked up and got a handcuff right here. Here he is.
00:42:50 That's a real jazz for your soul mother
00:42:52 right there.
00:42:54 I just cannot believe how much I love
00:42:56 Aliens.
00:42:58 I couldn't agree more.
00:43:00 But have we run the gamut for our deep
00:43:02 discussion about the realism
00:43:04 and the 100% confirmation that they are
00:43:06 real aliens?
00:43:08 We have met them on multiple occasions.
00:43:10 I'm thinking it's like a
00:43:12 they live situation mostly.
00:43:14 They're hidden in plain sight with all kinds of
00:43:16 bizarre gay filters.
00:43:18 We have some solid proof
00:43:20 that Obama is a lizard person.
00:43:22 We've got some real shit.
00:43:24 Hillary too. Hillary too.
00:43:26 We could have been ruled by aliens
00:43:28 but we fucked it up.
00:43:30 What are we going to do?
00:43:32 Humans making mistakes. That's probably the best
00:43:34 case aliens could make for wiping us out
00:43:36 is like, look, we could have ruled you
00:43:38 but you didn't vote with her.
00:43:40 So fuck you.
00:43:42 You work with her, you massage in his
00:43:44 piece of shit.
00:43:46 The aliens are super liberal cooks.
00:43:48 They invented it.
00:43:50 Dude, the first thing they went to
00:43:52 when they got here was Seattle.
00:43:54 That's when they got here.
00:43:56 I want to say that if you don't think
00:43:58 aliens are real, first of all
00:44:00 how dare you. Second of all
00:44:02 look no further
00:44:04 than the
00:44:06 I mean if you believe that there's a love
00:44:08 battleship underneath the pyramids of Giza
00:44:10 which you should because it's completely
00:44:12 feasible and I've been there myself.
00:44:14 Isn't it less than a millimeter thick?
00:44:16 It's like one atom thick.
00:44:18 And like two miles wide.
00:44:20 It's the love battleship.
00:44:22 And if you think yourself, well what's it
00:44:24 used for? I'll fucking tell you.
00:44:26 Back in the 1950s when the grays were getting
00:44:28 heated up and they're getting super mad
00:44:30 at the United States government because they
00:44:32 wouldn't give them weed.
00:44:34 That's all they wanted. That's the way they came
00:44:36 to earth for that dank kush bro.
00:44:38 They wouldn't give it from the United States government
00:44:40 because they were fucking prudes.
00:44:42 So some women from South America went over
00:44:44 I need to give them the weed so they'll
00:44:46 know they'll fuck off. So she went to the pyramid
00:44:48 of Giza and she went inside the love battleship
00:44:50 and she wished with all of her heart that they
00:44:52 would get so much weed that they would fucking
00:44:54 bark. You know what they did. They all got
00:44:56 sick and they ran away. So thank you women
00:44:58 from South America for powering the love battleship
00:45:00 and proving that aliens are fucking real.
00:45:02 Shit.
00:45:04 I am 100% convinced. Oh by the way
00:45:06 unlike ghosts, unlike ghosts
00:45:08 aliens are incredibly eco-friendly.
00:45:10 They're known for their hacky
00:45:12 sacks and general peace-loving nature
00:45:14 and have incredible taste and rap.
00:45:16 They're dykes.
00:45:18 I think I would take
00:45:20 an alien over a ghost any day of the week.
00:45:22 Who do you think would win an alien or a ghost?
00:45:24 What about an alien ghost?
00:45:26 That's what I said in the beginning.
00:45:28 But if aliens die
00:45:30 they have ghosts too don't they?
00:45:32 How do you know? We know that we have ghosts.
00:45:34 That's like the concept of interracial marriage.
00:45:36 It's never happened so let's stop discussing it.
00:45:38 It's not going to happen. We know because of the
00:45:40 dream bubbles that ghosts are real.
00:45:42 Yeah.
00:45:44 It's like
00:45:46 we don't know if they're going to have the concept of ghosts
00:45:48 because they might not have ghosts. We know we have ghosts
00:45:50 because we've grown up and evolved to have them
00:45:52 on the planet Earth. God has only
00:45:54 given human souls.
00:45:56 Those lowly aliens
00:45:58 are not superior beings enough.
00:46:00 The aliens might have their own gods.
00:46:04 They could have their own gods.
00:46:06 Guys, you know
00:46:08 like the saint when in Rome do what Romans do
00:46:10 if an alien dies on Earth
00:46:12 maybe it gains a ghost.
00:46:14 That's pretty good.
00:46:16 That's pretty good.
00:46:18 All right.
00:46:20 What if the alien comes to Earth
00:46:22 and is enraptured in our culture
00:46:24 and is born again a Christian?
00:46:26 Does he gain a soul?
00:46:28 Here guys, let me ask you this.
00:46:30 Ginger.
00:46:32 Let me ask you this.
00:46:34 If an alien lands in
00:46:36 the United Arab Emirates
00:46:38 and actually lands in an American airport
00:46:40 particularly United States soil
00:46:42 can he still get legally same sex married
00:46:44 because he's on American soil
00:46:46 but he's also in Saudi Arabia
00:46:48 so two conflicting laws.
00:46:50 Which law overrides for an alien?
00:46:52 What if he doesn't conform to human
00:46:54 gender binary things?
00:46:56 Can he get gay married at all?
00:46:58 The most common forms
00:47:00 of monsters are these vagina
00:47:02 alien types. Where does that exactly
00:47:04 fall on the spectrum? It seems female
00:47:06 at a glance. But they're all vagina
00:47:08 monsters.
00:47:10 Maybe all the aliens
00:47:12 in the real universe are all vagina
00:47:14 humanoids.
00:47:16 And the ones in the fake universe are the penis.
00:47:18 Of course.
00:47:20 Men, the patriarch is not real.
00:47:22 It's a social course.
00:47:24 It all comes together.
00:47:26 Little bit column A, little bit column B
00:47:28 motherfucker.
00:47:30 Well team
00:47:32 I think we did it.
00:47:34 What would you want to be in your UFO?
00:47:36 What's the sick UFO?
00:47:38 What UFO do you want to buy from your UFO car
00:47:40 dealership?
00:47:42 Jimmy Neutron's
00:47:44 spaceship.
00:47:46 What about the show called Rick and Morty though?
00:47:48 No.
00:47:50 It's really smart.
00:47:52 Seriously for real, the Jimmy Neutron
00:47:54 movie of them all turning like the
00:47:56 Ferris wheel and stuff into spaceships
00:47:58 is like the coolest thing I've ever
00:48:00 seen in my whole life.
00:48:02 Why?
00:48:06 I fantasized about turning stuff into
00:48:08 a spaceship and just going.
00:48:10 And just going up there.
00:48:12 Also that eighties movie I mentioned.
00:48:14 Anything like that. Anything that's like
00:48:16 real.
00:48:18 Like Jimmy Neutron.
00:48:20 I want the spaceship.
00:48:22 Is Jimmy Neutron
00:48:24 the real universe or is he in the fake
00:48:26 universe?
00:48:28 Maybe we're in the fake universe.
00:48:30 He's a genius. He can travel between the
00:48:32 universes. He's not limited
00:48:34 by such things like the rest of us.
00:48:36 I want a purple sparkly spaceship.
00:48:38 Well, age post is a very dank looking
00:48:40 spaceship in there.
00:48:42 It's shining bright.
00:48:44 You guys ever seen Spaceballs?
00:48:46 Of course.
00:48:48 I want the spaceship they have
00:48:50 that's just the RV
00:48:52 but it has engines on the back.
00:48:54 That's a good one. I thought you were
00:48:56 going to go with Mega Maid.
00:48:58 Like Van the rest of my life anyways.
00:49:00 It's going to be perpetually poor. So it'll feel like home.
00:49:02 You know?
00:49:04 Alright.
00:49:06 Is this one?
00:49:08 Is this one?
00:49:10 Is this one?
00:49:12 Oh my god!
00:49:14 Yes!
00:49:16 You win. This is the best one.
00:49:18 That's the one.
00:49:20 That shit. Oh god. That was in Lego Magazine
00:49:22 every month and I was like I want it so bad.
00:49:24 I had it.
00:49:26 I lost all the pieces
00:49:28 that I have no clue.
00:49:30 Oh my god. We have to go on a quest
00:49:32 to find all the pieces of the Master Emerald.
00:49:34 We have to go back.
00:49:36 I remade that UFO in like a million
00:49:38 different ways. It was so fucking fun.
00:49:40 We got a...
00:49:42 When we all do Radcon
00:49:44 Lego Land, there will be
00:49:46 great research.
00:49:48 Those were the coolest aliens.
00:49:50 Radcon Lego Land
00:49:52 We have to.
00:49:54 Lego Con? I don't know. I got nothing.
00:49:56 Alright.
00:49:58 I feel like my thoughts can be summed up
00:50:00 in this image.
00:50:02 Fucking drag and drop. Please.
00:50:04 Please. My computer is freezing up
00:50:06 because they know.
00:50:08 Okay.
00:50:10 Nothing in this book is true
00:50:12 but it's exactly how things are.
00:50:14 With a bunch of just fucking
00:50:16 aliens. I like how
00:50:18 this is the third edition revise that
00:50:20 explains it.
00:50:22 You know what?
00:50:24 Real serious question. This is the last thing
00:50:26 I've got to say on this topic.
00:50:28 What's the deal with fucking crop circles
00:50:30 if aliens aren't making them?
00:50:32 I actually had a thought about this
00:50:34 that I forgot to bring up.
00:50:36 The aliens put crop circles down
00:50:38 because we have constantly been making
00:50:40 crop rectangles and they get confused.
00:50:42 They think we're talking to them.
00:50:44 So they reply with the crop circles.
00:50:46 They hear the rectangles and they're like
00:50:48 oh, okay, a circle.
00:50:50 And they're like, oh.
00:50:52 They don't get it.
00:50:54 Maybe the square in alien language
00:50:56 means DTF this whole time.
00:50:58 Yeah, yeah.
00:51:00 And that's why they abduct us and give us anal probes.
00:51:02 They think that we consented already.
00:51:04 That makes sense.
00:51:06 Oh, we're going to press charges super fucking hard.
00:51:08 We need alien safe spaces.
00:51:10 Final question guys.
00:51:12 Are skeletons aliens?
00:51:14 Think about it. They aren't human.
00:51:16 They aren't alive.
00:51:18 Okay.
00:51:20 Agreed.
00:51:22 Yeah, okay.
00:51:24 We wrapped it up guys. We did it.
00:51:26 Yeah, okay, that's done.
00:51:28 All right, everybody.
00:51:30 If anyone doesn't have any final points,
00:51:32 let's just take a look at these fucking questions over here.
00:51:34 Yeah.
00:51:36 Did anyone, by the way, do the thing on the fan discord?
00:51:38 No.
00:51:40 Ask the questions.
00:51:42 Go submit it right now.
00:51:44 We'll get some while I butter us up
00:51:46 Yeah.
00:51:48 Okay.
00:51:50 Okay, what do you got with this one?
00:51:52 At LibRplex, I guess,
00:51:54 asks
00:51:56 tips on winning arguments
00:51:58 slash being more persuasive.
00:52:00 How do you get people to be persuaded?
00:52:02 Munchy, what do you do when you want people to believe you?
00:52:04 When I want people to believe me,
00:52:06 I just don't,
00:52:08 like when I want people to believe me,
00:52:10 I don't know if I necessarily want that a lot.
00:52:12 I will like, the point of the conversation
00:52:14 is that I won't be to spread my ideology
00:52:16 most of the time, if ever.
00:52:18 It will just be to explain myself
00:52:20 and then come to my own conclusions after everything is said
00:52:22 and done.
00:52:24 Well, if I explicitly want someone to conform
00:52:26 to what I like, because I don't know,
00:52:28 I just want to emotionally manipulate them for any reason,
00:52:30 then I'll just act
00:52:32 like a really good person,
00:52:34 they'll feel bad for not agreeing with me.
00:52:36 I'm really cranking up at
00:52:38 your like straight-faced
00:52:40 answer as you posted
00:52:42 a picture of a cobra with a fucking cigarette in it.
00:52:44 I just got
00:52:46 really, really
00:52:48 without comment.
00:52:50 No human could ever conceive of this.
00:52:52 It had to be external forces.
00:52:54 It's the only explanation.
00:52:56 I love that snake.
00:52:58 What's the guy fucking doing?
00:53:00 What's his angle here?
00:53:02 His angle is getting turned
00:53:04 as fuck.
00:53:06 Alright, I'm going to have to say,
00:53:08 there's so many images.
00:53:10 I want to edit this just so that I can make sure
00:53:12 that all the images get put in the
00:53:14 thing. So if you've just been listening,
00:53:16 the video version of this podcast
00:53:18 will have images on.
00:53:20 So, there you go.
00:53:22 Hey, so on the thing of
00:53:24 how to win an argument, I would say
00:53:26 that somebody who's great at winning arguments,
00:53:28 whether you like the guy or not,
00:53:30 is like Donald Trump.
00:53:32 Because what Donald Trump does,
00:53:34 more like Donald Trump, am I right?
00:53:36 Got him.
00:53:38 What Trump does
00:53:40 is the classic
00:53:42 debate tactic of just
00:53:44 not giving a fuck with a question
00:53:46 you were just asked and just making up
00:53:48 an answer to some other question.
00:53:50 It's extremely high level.
00:53:52 But if you're in a debate,
00:53:54 I don't know, maybe there's
00:53:56 a formal setting or whatever,
00:53:58 but if you just want people to be on your side,
00:54:00 if you just want to win overall,
00:54:02 eventually, and there's no autistic rules
00:54:04 going on or anything,
00:54:06 just ignore attacks
00:54:08 and ignore things
00:54:10 that are about the substance of what's wrong
00:54:12 with your position. Just focus on
00:54:14 what's wrong with their position
00:54:16 and hammer away at it incessantly
00:54:18 and discard all decorum
00:54:20 and all semblance of trying to be
00:54:22 acting in good faith
00:54:24 or take the other person's argument at its face value.
00:54:26 If your only goal is to win,
00:54:28 just find a point
00:54:30 that you think they're vulnerable at
00:54:32 and hammer them over and over again.
00:54:34 Exactly how people do it.
00:54:36 My two suggestions would be first.
00:54:38 If you just want to win the argument,
00:54:40 always appeal to emotion.
00:54:42 Yeah, that's a good one.
00:54:44 The limbic brain is what's responsible for decision making
00:54:46 and that's the emotional part
00:54:48 of the brain. The neocortex does not
00:54:50 have anything to do with decision making.
00:54:52 So if you want to sway somebody quickly, appeal to their emotions,
00:54:54 not logic, because logic is not very
00:54:56 persuasive. You use logic after
00:54:58 the fact to justify your emotional responses.
00:55:00 But if you actually want to change somebody's
00:55:02 mind, I highly recommend the Socratic method
00:55:04 of arguing where you present
00:55:06 your points as questions.
00:55:08 So you ask them questions
00:55:10 and you basically back them into a corner
00:55:12 to basically make your points for you.
00:55:14 Because that way they're coming to the conclusions
00:55:16 themselves and it feels like it's their ideas
00:55:18 and their learning as opposed to you beating them
00:55:20 over the head with what the right answer is.
00:55:22 Yeah.
00:55:24 I have a suggestion.
00:55:26 This is kind of a bit of a tip here, guys.
00:55:28 So if you're arguing with
00:55:30 someone, the best thing you can do
00:55:32 is not to make the other person
00:55:34 feel attacked by your side.
00:55:36 Because as soon as a person
00:55:38 feels attacked, they get defensive
00:55:40 and as soon as a person gets defensive
00:55:42 it's shut off.
00:55:44 The conversation is shut off. You're no longer going to be
00:55:46 able to persuade them because
00:55:48 they're locked in and they're not
00:55:50 going to be budging and they're going to be stubborn.
00:55:52 So don't make them feel
00:55:54 attacked.
00:55:56 Nate, your argument about ignoring
00:55:58 the
00:56:00 question you were asked or whatever is depressing.
00:56:02 That's good if you're on a debate
00:56:04 and you're trying to convince the audience
00:56:06 but not the person you're debating.
00:56:08 Conduct is important here.
00:56:10 Entirely true.
00:56:12 And failing all that
00:56:14 puts an image of a snake with a cigarette in it's mouth.
00:56:16 I don't know if that will win
00:56:18 every argument.
00:56:20 By the way, just on the subject
00:56:22 of debates or arguments, this always gets me.
00:56:24 Considering Tom's
00:56:26 emotional argument point there.
00:56:28 It's so true.
00:56:30 Let's say, for example,
00:56:32 you've got some debate going on
00:56:34 between a mom
00:56:36 whose kid was
00:56:38 kidnapped by a pedophile and raised
00:56:40 or something.
00:56:42 What was he wearing?
00:56:44 You have the mom here
00:56:46 who's experienced this.
00:56:48 Let's say that the ideas, her and her organization
00:56:50 are pushing for stricter legalization
00:56:52 laws to outlaw
00:56:54 and let's say
00:56:56 Lollicon porn, for example.
00:56:58 So he's very near and dear to Nate's heart.
00:57:00 Indeed, indeed.
00:57:02 And then on the other side,
00:57:04 you've got a fucking scientist
00:57:06 who's saying, I have studied this
00:57:08 and I am telling you, there is no connection
00:57:10 between this particular art
00:57:12 or whatever and increased rates
00:57:14 of pedophilia. If you've got those two people,
00:57:16 even if the dude is correct
00:57:18 and can demonstrate that he is correct,
00:57:20 nobody's going to give a shit
00:57:22 what they care about is making the other person feel good
00:57:24 because something bad happened to them.
00:57:26 That is how it works every fucking time.
00:57:28 You cannot deal with these kinds of things.
00:57:30 It's totally illogical, but you see it
00:57:32 all the fucking time.
00:57:34 It's the worst. Which is why I so
00:57:36 hate all these
00:57:38 advocates
00:57:40 for all these causes that people
00:57:42 individually may have experienced the particular
00:57:44 crime, but then they go on to try
00:57:46 to advocate policies
00:57:48 to change things for everybody.
00:57:50 These people are looking at anecdotal evidence.
00:57:52 It's your own experience, sure,
00:57:54 but it's completely anecdotal.
00:57:56 It's the mass studies that actually matter
00:57:58 when it comes to making decisions on a large scale.
00:58:00 People can't emotionally quantify statistics.
00:58:02 That's why we're all fucking retarded.
00:58:04 That's why the aliens come.
00:58:06 They're going to kill us and I change my mind.
00:58:08 They should do it.
00:58:10 I want a meteor to kill us rather than aliens.
00:58:12 It's my religion, you know.
00:58:14 What if the meteor was
00:58:16 brought here by aliens?
00:58:18 Would you rather be
00:58:20 a ghost, skeleton, or alien?
00:58:22 Huh?
00:58:24 Aliens are gentle. Aliens are compassionate.
00:58:26 They understand what I want.
00:58:28 They don't indicate it to my needs.
00:58:30 If an alien kills you, you'd be
00:58:32 euthanized. If a skeleton kills you, you'd be
00:58:34 butchered.
00:58:36 You're right about that.
00:58:38 Skeletons can really get under your skin enough.
00:58:40 I haven't been listening to this
00:58:42 entire question because I'm looking at this
00:58:44 making them laugh so much.
00:58:46 You have to have the snake
00:58:48 up the entire Q&A session
00:58:50 so nobody hears any of this.
00:58:52 Good idea. Good idea.
00:58:56 Alright, let's get to the question.
00:58:58 Wait, wait, Maja was going to say something.
00:59:00 I said it fun, but now the moment's over.
00:59:02 Dammit. Well, shit.
00:59:04 If an alien kills you,
00:59:06 you'd be euthanized.
00:59:08 If a skeleton kills you, you'd be butchered.
00:59:10 You're right about that.
00:59:12 Skeletons can really get under your skin,
00:59:14 you know?
00:59:18 Okay, what do we got here?
00:59:20 Here's one.
00:59:22 Hey, what's up, you imitating mother fuckers.
00:59:24 They ask,
00:59:26 do you lock your windows at night?
00:59:28 I think they want to get into your house, Munchie,
00:59:30 so be careful how you answer this question.
00:59:32 Yeah, I fucking...
00:59:34 I do not, in fact.
00:59:36 I always have my windows open and with a fan
00:59:38 blasting as loud as fucking humanly possible.
00:59:40 If you ever come up with a little of my streams
00:59:42 of video quality,
00:59:44 or sometimes arm retrieval because fuck arm retrieval,
00:59:46 then you'll hear my fan.
00:59:48 It's legendary, it's powerful,
00:59:50 and it's throbbing constantly.
00:59:52 I would say that I, yeah,
00:59:54 when it was hot during the summer,
00:59:56 I've got a little AC unit that I just left the window open
00:59:58 and I just didn't give a fuck about it.
01:00:00 I would just leave it open for days
01:00:02 and give a shit.
01:00:04 I'm on the second story, though, so that we'll probably...
01:00:06 I am...
01:00:08 I'm not going to answer this, actually.
01:00:10 Yeah, definitely.
01:00:12 Whenever I can.
01:00:14 This won't matter because he's not at this house anymore.
01:00:16 But Digi used to not lock his doors,
01:00:18 and it was the scariest fucking thing
01:00:20 of my entire life.
01:00:22 You know what I... I always think
01:00:24 about this scene from Full Metal Jacket,
01:00:26 which is where, you know,
01:00:28 Private Pile at Fat Motherfucker piece of shit,
01:00:30 like he...
01:00:32 Whatever, Sergeant Gunnery, whatever,
01:00:34 is reviewing there like...
01:00:36 He's just reviewing the troops and whatever
01:00:38 bootcamp for joining the Marines.
01:00:40 And he sees this fat piece of shit
01:00:42 did not lock his footlocker.
01:00:44 And he just says, so matter of factly,
01:00:46 like Private Pile,
01:00:48 you stupid, stupid motherfucker,
01:00:50 there is nothing I hate more in this world
01:00:52 than an unlocked footlocker
01:00:54 because if it weren't for people like you,
01:00:56 there would be no thievery in this world.
01:00:58 Didn't you already say that in a different podcast?
01:01:00 Did I?
01:01:02 I probably did. It's one of my favorite lines ever, though,
01:01:04 because I had not even considered the idea
01:01:06 that like, what?
01:01:08 People should be responsible for protecting their own things
01:01:10 and we should accept the reality
01:01:12 that human beings are generally self-interested
01:01:14 so it's our responsibility to account for that
01:01:16 and to manage our ways through life
01:01:18 considering that and facing fucking reality
01:01:20 instead of a utopian ideal
01:01:22 that isn't fucking real and never will be
01:01:24 and is a waste of time to imagine
01:01:26 is the real way, where, where, where, where works?
01:01:28 What the fuck?
01:01:30 And that's why Starfleet will never happen.
01:01:32 Starfleet could happen, we'll see.
01:01:34 It's not as utopian as it seems, but okay.
01:01:36 All right.
01:01:38 What was the question again?
01:01:40 Do you lock your windows at night?
01:01:42 Yeah, I always lock my door extensively.
01:01:44 I have, I have like three different locks
01:01:46 on my fucking door.
01:01:48 I have a dead bull and I have the fucking normal lock
01:01:50 and then I have like that fucking
01:01:52 Shoryu thing at the top.
01:01:54 I hear you.
01:01:56 I don't want anyone to be able to get in or out.
01:01:58 I'm going to protect this really
01:02:00 by not allowing myself to come out at night
01:02:02 because I know I'm not going to be responsible.
01:02:04 My, my doors and windows
01:02:06 are all locked by elaborate
01:02:08 point-and-click adventure game puzzles
01:02:10 that I have to solve every time I leave
01:02:12 and enter.
01:02:14 Keeps me on my toes.
01:02:16 Check out this guy, this like pizza guy
01:02:18 and this pizza box coffin I posted by the way.
01:02:20 Oh my god, Sans with boobs also.
01:02:22 I know, I love that.
01:02:24 Just to show people images.
01:02:26 Okay.
01:02:28 Yeah, let's save this image.
01:02:30 I'm going to put it on the screen.
01:02:32 Ben's not going to fucking do that.
01:02:34 No, I'll do it.
01:02:36 I'll edit, I'll edit the thing.
01:02:38 Sounds good to me.
01:02:40 There's too many images for it to be found.
01:02:42 We really, we really have gone overboard
01:02:44 with the fucking image posting this episode.
01:02:46 I didn't expect the images to be in the video.
01:02:48 It's just we just started posting aliens
01:02:50 ahead of time to get ourselves psyched up
01:02:52 for the right views.
01:02:54 Oh, how psyched we were.
01:02:56 Just to help you out.
01:02:58 We're going to post our time stamp
01:03:00 so you can kind of sync that up with the podcast
01:03:02 and help you find where they are.
01:03:04 That'll save you some work.
01:03:06 Maybe.
01:03:08 Good thinking.
01:03:10 Okay, do you have a question from the...
01:03:12 Actually, wait, no, we didn't hear Tom and Mage's answers.
01:03:14 I'm curious.
01:03:16 Do you guys lock your doors at windows at night?
01:03:18 I have so much shit down here.
01:03:20 I don't trust anybody.
01:03:22 I don't trust the people I have to live with.
01:03:24 I don't trust any of you motherfuckers.
01:03:26 Agreed, neither do I. Very smart. What about you, Mage?
01:03:28 I trust people so much that I'm not going to answer this question
01:03:30 because if anyone
01:03:32 goes out at night
01:03:34 and sees windows
01:03:36 and if they see locked windows and open windows
01:03:38 if they knew my answer
01:03:40 they could narrow down which windows
01:03:42 could potentially be mine.
01:03:44 So I'm not going to say.
01:03:46 That does reduce the significant amount of windows
01:03:48 from the list of Mage's windows.
01:03:50 Oh, but now I know that you have windows.
01:03:52 That's already narrowing down.
01:03:54 Well, that's a given.
01:03:56 We all gave our answers and you're the most mysterious
01:03:58 PCP member of all time
01:04:00 even to other members.
01:04:02 That's definitely true.
01:04:04 I like it. I think it's great.
01:04:06 Check out this question.
01:04:08 Here's a good one.
01:04:10 If you're 15 to 16
01:04:12 year old self
01:04:14 saw how you look and act now
01:04:16 where you are now, what would they say?
01:04:18 Let's start with Munchy.
01:04:20 What if you were 16 years old again?
01:04:22 What would you do?
01:04:24 I think the question was
01:04:26 what would they say about where you are now?
01:04:28 They'd probably say, wow, in two months
01:04:30 I'm going to be fucking rolling in it, bro.
01:04:34 Yeah.
01:04:36 They'd probably be like, wow, nothing's changed.
01:04:40 He'd be so disappointed.
01:04:42 He'd be so distraught.
01:04:44 You didn't even get that dank cyborg eye
01:04:46 you've been hyping up your whole fucking civilization.
01:04:48 I didn't even get turned into a crystal skeleton
01:04:50 and get to weeping legs.
01:04:54 How about you, Gib?
01:04:56 If you're 15 to 16 year old self saw you
01:04:58 what would you think?
01:05:00 How you look, how you act, what you're doing?
01:05:02 He'd probably, well, let me think
01:05:04 was I interested in like
01:05:06 internet game review type people
01:05:08 at the time, like 15, 16,
01:05:10 maybe.
01:05:12 But I'd probably just be like
01:05:14 unimpressed because I'm not like
01:05:16 a super rock star at the time.
01:05:18 What the fuck? The Beatles
01:05:20 got big when in the 20s
01:05:22 halfway through yet, bitch.
01:05:24 Kill yourself.
01:05:26 That's what he would say.
01:05:28 But then I would say, grow up.
01:05:30 Jesus.
01:05:32 It's not all about doing it immediately.
01:05:34 Yeah, silly boy. And then I would kill him
01:05:36 and then I would start disappearing.
01:05:38 I know when I was
01:05:40 15 to 16 I mostly
01:05:42 spent all my time watching anime.
01:05:44 Specifically one, specifically
01:05:46 like big long running shounens.
01:05:48 I just did that all day every day.
01:05:50 And I would definitely
01:05:52 be happy about where
01:05:54 I am now, I think.
01:05:56 I mean, I'm saying this from the perspective of what I think that guy
01:05:58 would say, but even back then
01:06:00 I wanted, I'm not that swole, but I wanted
01:06:02 to be somewhat, so you know what, I'd be disappointed
01:06:04 that I wasn't more fit, but I'm working on it.
01:06:06 I'm working on it.
01:06:08 But he would be happy
01:06:10 that I found my path in life
01:06:12 and am financially secure
01:06:14 and independent
01:06:16 and am achieving
01:06:18 my personal dreams.
01:06:20 I think he would be very happy. I think he'd be happy about all those things.
01:06:22 I certainly am.
01:06:24 Let's look at some
01:06:26 Patreon questions.
01:06:28 Wait, after Mage and Tom made the question.
01:06:30 Keep forgetting them.
01:06:32 I'm trying to read these
01:06:34 and listen to you
01:06:36 and also read these questions. Some of them are just
01:06:38 like, I don't care.
01:06:40 Okay, hang on to that one.
01:06:42 Tom, Mage, what do you think?
01:06:44 I think
01:06:46 my 16-year-old self would be like,
01:06:48 good job losing the weight. I'm pretty fat.
01:06:50 Now you're not.
01:06:52 I cannot even imagine you being fat.
01:06:54 I know, it's crazy to think about.
01:06:56 It was a crazy time.
01:06:58 Let me tell you.
01:07:00 Those stairs, man.
01:07:02 They scared me.
01:07:04 I told you.
01:07:06 I'd be like, why the fuck haven't you
01:07:08 finished your comic yet? You fuck.
01:07:10 But then I'd be like, oh, I can do 3D
01:07:12 and I'd be like, whoa, holy shit, I want to do that
01:07:14 but it seems so impossible right now.
01:07:16 Now you're doing it and I'd be like, I know.
01:07:18 You've finished a bunch of comics since then, though.
01:07:20 You finished a bunch of shit.
01:07:22 Scootaloo!
01:07:24 To me, my comic is like
01:07:26 a Shonen manga start to finish.
01:07:28 That's all my ideas are.
01:07:30 I haven't done any yet.
01:07:32 So it'd be like, you fucking hack.
01:07:34 Joan Vasquez never even had a real job
01:07:36 right out of high school. He got J.T.H.M. published
01:07:38 and we got famous. What the fuck is wrong with you?
01:07:40 Joan Vasquez is the guy who did all those
01:07:42 weird puppet things you made
01:07:44 to review about 100 years ago, right?
01:07:46 No.
01:07:48 No, he's the guy who did
01:07:50 J.T.H.M. and Invader Zim.
01:07:52 Yeah, that's right.
01:07:54 No, that was M.Strange and he's a cool guy.
01:07:56 He's what got me into 3D.
01:07:58 So I would be him.
01:08:00 He's what converted me from a 2D
01:08:02 being to a 3D being.
01:08:04 It was a big influence.
01:08:06 I'm waiting to find my idol that converts me
01:08:08 to a 4D being.
01:08:10 I don't really transcend this mortal coil.
01:08:12 How about you, Mage?
01:08:14 What would your 15 to 16 year old self say?
01:08:16 Look at it now.
01:08:18 Well, immediately it would be the opposite
01:08:20 of what Tom says. It would be like,
01:08:22 oh, do you let yourself go, didn't you?
01:08:24 Oh, no!
01:08:26 I mean, not too much,
01:08:28 but I would have preferred to be
01:08:30 a different body type than I am now.
01:08:32 Still would.
01:08:34 Hit the squats, fam. Hit the squats.
01:08:36 Yeah.
01:08:38 She would probably be quite happy
01:08:40 with what I'm doing right now
01:08:42 and would be slightly disappointed
01:08:44 that I still haven't finished
01:08:46 any comics yet, as well.
01:08:48 Because I actually did start a comic
01:08:50 when I was 14 or so
01:08:52 and I sort of stopped doing it.
01:08:54 Maybe one day you and Phantom Horn
01:08:56 will get back together and finish
01:08:58 that old comic.
01:09:00 We got to leap around.
01:09:02 That was a hard no right there.
01:09:04 I know.
01:09:06 Right, here's a question
01:09:08 from the Patreon Discord.
01:09:10 Patreon.com
01:09:12 Donate as we talk to you, for real.
01:09:14 It's true, we do.
01:09:16 Even Bin Saint is here, unfortunately.
01:09:18 Don't tell them that.
01:09:20 They'll leave.
01:09:22 Water says,
01:09:24 what is your favorite thing
01:09:26 another member on the PCP has created?
01:09:28 Oh, good question.
01:09:30 That is a fantastic question.
01:09:32 The Vapors.
01:09:34 Excellent choice.
01:09:36 Chapter 2, specifically.
01:09:38 Chapter 2 is...
01:09:40 I like Chapter 1 better, I think.
01:09:42 It's shorter but denser with good content, I think.
01:09:44 I don't know.
01:09:46 I gotta think. This is a tough one.
01:09:48 Who am I even going to pick?
01:09:50 I like a lot of old Digi contents.
01:09:52 Project Awesomeness.
01:09:54 I like a lot of that.
01:09:56 Dude, what the freak!
01:09:58 My favorite line.
01:10:00 It's my favorite line of all time.
01:10:02 Yeah, that's pretty good.
01:10:04 Yeah, I like old Digi Bros.
01:10:06 The Dark Souls playthrough of Digi Bros. was nice.
01:10:08 But that's not my favorite thing of all time.
01:10:10 That's just pretty good.
01:10:12 I guess like Horseshoe Finale
01:10:14 and the One Year Later Horseshoe Finale thing
01:10:16 by Jesse Endless.
01:10:18 Jesse Endless.
01:10:20 Horseshoe Finale was great.
01:10:24 Yeah, okay. Horseshoe Finale is definitely great.
01:10:26 The first thing I ever saw of Jesse's
01:10:28 was kind of the most
01:10:30 mind-blowing out of all.
01:10:32 Just because it was the first time I ever saw Jesse's
01:10:34 shit and
01:10:36 really fucked me up.
01:10:38 It was the
01:10:40 review of the Crystal Castle,
01:10:42 Crystal Kingdom review,
01:10:44 whatever. It's like it's Colt Corona
01:10:46 doing a review of whatever. Crystal Empire.
01:10:48 Thank you. Thank you.
01:10:50 Brony Curious. Always good to have you on an episode.
01:10:52 I had another pony moment
01:10:54 this morning too. I felt hot.
01:10:56 What was it? Tell me about it.
01:10:58 I was in a chat
01:11:00 and I have some art people
01:11:02 in the chat and Cece was there. She was talking about
01:11:04 the next season of RuPaul's Drag Race
01:11:06 and one of the people on there was Trixie.
01:11:08 I just thought Trixie, Pony, because I didn't see
01:11:10 the context of the conversation. Hell yeah.
01:11:12 I'm never going to be cured. It's terminal.
01:11:14 Yeah. Whenever I hear of President
01:11:16 or First Lady Fluttershy, I'm always like
01:11:18 oh wait, fuck it's not the pony. Shit.
01:11:20 I fucked it up again. She's not hot.
01:11:22 Dammit.
01:11:24 I was always confused
01:11:26 when I type in rule 34
01:11:28 Trixie and I would get like Timmy Turner.
01:11:30 I didn't understand.
01:11:32 Now we're talking.
01:11:34 Now we're cooking with jazz.
01:11:38 What else is great? I love
01:11:40 Brunswick that Ben made.
01:11:42 Brunswick is great.
01:11:44 Yeah, like Brunswick a lot.
01:11:46 I just love Gibbs content in general.
01:11:48 Yeah, I was going to say my favorite
01:11:50 content is like the one little animation
01:11:52 Gibbs did with the glass of water.
01:11:54 Oh, the fish one.
01:11:56 Oh, of course.
01:11:58 There's a fish at the door.
01:12:00 I watch both You've Got Chainmail
01:12:02 and Pokemon Go miniscule review
01:12:04 like every single day of my life.
01:12:06 You've Got Chainmail is a masterpiece.
01:12:08 You've Got Chainmail is the best thing you've ever made.
01:12:10 I'm going to have a
01:12:12 sequel at some point. You've got Platemail.
01:12:14 Oh, yeah.
01:12:16 Please. I can't wait.
01:12:18 I'm dying for it.
01:12:20 I like it all.
01:12:22 I like it all. It's all pretty good.
01:12:24 I don't know. I can't think of any
01:12:26 specifics. I like Topten trampolines.
01:12:28 Topten reasons like a trampoline.
01:12:30 That is a good one. The trampolines one is great.
01:12:32 I mean, one of my favorite videos
01:12:34 of all time is like Anthony C's
01:12:36 review of cancel out wedding.
01:12:38 He's not up. Oh, I see.
01:12:40 Yeah, like they work together on it.
01:12:42 Invite Anthony C
01:12:44 to the PCP. Press one if you want
01:12:46 Anthony C in the PCP member.
01:12:48 And press two
01:12:50 if you want Anthony C to be the only remaining
01:12:52 PCP member immediately
01:12:54 afterward.
01:12:56 Incredible.
01:12:58 We couldn't have Anthony C in the PCP
01:13:00 because every episode would be scripted.
01:13:02 There would be a whole script that he would write. We'd all have to do.
01:13:04 And that would be each episode.
01:13:06 Oh, is that a dig? Are you digging at him?
01:13:08 That's funny. No, that wasn't a dig.
01:13:10 That was a compliment to his
01:13:12 insane work ethic. Oh, of course.
01:13:14 OK, OK. Tom, I fucking love
01:13:16 your low-poly 3D models
01:13:18 you make of like stuff
01:13:20 like the sushi you did
01:13:22 and I think you did the sushi.
01:13:24 The Cuphead famous.
01:13:26 Yeah, Cuphead was recent.
01:13:28 Like all the little cute
01:13:30 PlayStation-y, PlayStation 1
01:13:32 sort of things.
01:13:34 I love that. Tom, I
01:13:36 have recently procured
01:13:38 a desire to have sex with Cuphead.
01:13:40 So I was hoping you could
01:13:42 give me that model for my
01:13:44 disgusting animations that I must do.
01:13:46 Frinter.
01:13:48 Exactly.
01:13:50 Fantastic.
01:13:52 I think some of my favorite stuff. I was going to say
01:13:54 Fisher the Door. That's definitely one of my favorite things.
01:13:56 There's a legend. So fucking good.
01:13:58 Animate more hippo.
01:14:00 Fuck.
01:14:02 Yeah, just do all this work. I demand it for free.
01:14:04 That's just the kind of guy I am.
01:14:06 I'll give you exposure.
01:14:08 I really
01:14:10 liked best game ever. To the elements.
01:14:12 When I strip you naked and put you on the fucking cold
01:14:14 and then you'll be dead. There's your exposure.
01:14:16 Dumbass. Okay.
01:14:18 I'm calming down. I'm settling down.
01:14:20 I just tweeted something like that. There was like a comic strip
01:14:22 that someone retweeted. It was like, hey, can I
01:14:24 use this on my website? Oh, that's right.
01:14:26 And it's just like, my dad told me about exposure.
01:14:28 That's what you die from in the desert.
01:14:30 Yeah, that's probably where I got the idea to
01:14:32 steal it. Loki's stealing some jokes here.
01:14:34 Loki.
01:14:36 I like best game ever, Undertale. I thought that was really good.
01:14:38 Oh, no.
01:14:40 Oh, no, Tom. What have you done?
01:14:42 I love it. It actually is pretty good.
01:14:44 It is pretty good for what it is. I just like how
01:14:46 you've ruined the game at the end. It's fantastic.
01:14:48 If you fucking watch this
01:14:50 and you play the game, guess what? I've ruined everything for you.
01:14:52 You'll never experience your fag
01:14:54 and kill yourself. That's the good part.
01:14:56 Because the reason I like that so much
01:14:58 is like, I almost did
01:15:00 watch it. But I'm like, no, I think I'm going to play Undertale
01:15:02 at some point. So I'm not going to watch it. So I saved
01:15:04 myself. I saved myself
01:15:06 the horrible fate. And so it had
01:15:08 some personal weight for me.
01:15:10 The video is an interactive experience.
01:15:12 It is. It is.
01:15:14 I like your
01:15:16 Gurren Lagoon Part 1
01:15:18 and
01:15:20 what was that other one?
01:15:22 There's only a few. I'm trying to think of
01:15:24 what it was. I know. I know. There's not that many.
01:15:26 We Agua Episode 1
01:15:28 about speed running
01:15:30 is a masterpiece
01:15:32 of vlog technology.
01:15:36 No, there's nothing else. I've never done anything.
01:15:38 It's nothing else.
01:15:40 Something that's kind of recent
01:15:42 that I really like. Phantom Reviews.
01:15:44 Phantom Reviews is great.
01:15:46 I agree. Mage, I was going to say
01:15:48 something I liked from you was
01:15:50 the transformation animation
01:15:52 you did with your character.
01:15:54 Oh, the map fight.
01:15:56 Fucking great. The keyframing
01:15:58 on that is so good.
01:16:02 It's got punch to it. I like it.
01:16:04 Thank you.
01:16:06 When you post that, I was like
01:16:08 fuck, that's what I wanted.
01:16:10 That's what I want.
01:16:12 I think
01:16:14 the problem with Nightmare Moon Ark,
01:16:16 the greatest video series
01:16:18 ever made.
01:16:20 Pretty keen on that.
01:16:22 Oh, and my favorite thing
01:16:24 from you, Munchy, is
01:16:26 arm retrieval.
01:16:28 Oh, no!
01:16:30 My favorite thing is Investigate.
01:16:32 Wait a minute.
01:16:34 I'm so sorry.
01:16:36 I go, like, three people here.
01:16:38 It's like, we'll do comics someday.
01:16:40 Someday.
01:16:42 Hey, man, they're tough.
01:16:44 I think we all know what the best creation
01:16:46 of everybody in here is.
01:16:48 And it's clearly the Undertailer.
01:16:50 The best creation any of us has ever made.
01:16:52 I got to give props to
01:16:54 known member of the PCP, Toby Fox,
01:16:56 for his creation of a little game you might know called Undertail.
01:16:58 It's really gotten a lot of mileage
01:17:00 here on this podcast.
01:17:02 Yeah, Toby isn't a member of the PCP,
01:17:04 but Undertail is.
01:17:06 That's true. You're not wrong.
01:17:08 You're not wrong.
01:17:10 Also, like,
01:17:12 a while ago,
01:17:14 you guys made the silly parody
01:17:16 with the ponies
01:17:18 where you all guys, like, switch cutie masters
01:17:20 or something like that.
01:17:22 Oh, the cutie marker fossil.
01:17:24 That's the stuff I was thinking about. It was because it was pony stuff.
01:17:26 Oh, right.
01:17:28 I forgot about those. That was, like, my passion project.
01:17:30 Yeah, it was pretty good.
01:17:32 And what a passion project was.
01:17:34 It's not bad.
01:17:36 Anything involving
01:17:38 T-Bap was incredible.
01:17:40 It is and slash was incredible.
01:17:42 Can you just define
01:17:44 for me what it is?
01:17:46 You always talk about how you, like, like, define that for me.
01:17:48 No, it's like, you always said
01:17:50 that you like the aesthetic of T-Bap,
01:17:52 or, like, you like the chemistry
01:17:54 that was, like, that good.
01:17:56 I've never known what the fuck that means,
01:17:58 because I'm like an idiot on the piece,
01:18:00 you know, because, like,
01:18:02 before I learned how to fucking talk,
01:18:04 well, the piece of me as well, but on T-Bap.
01:18:06 Like, I listen back to, like, the things I used to say
01:18:08 and the arguments I would make about the show,
01:18:10 and I'm just like, Jesus Christ, none of this is good.
01:18:12 I disagree with that.
01:18:14 I think there was some good shit there.
01:18:16 First of all, I think there was good shit,
01:18:18 but that's not the reason.
01:18:20 I don't care about the actual subject matter
01:18:22 or the actual conversation going on.
01:18:24 I care about the meta elements
01:18:26 at play within T-Bap,
01:18:28 the most important thing
01:18:30 in my entire life.
01:18:32 I care about the professionality
01:18:34 and, like, how much effort was put
01:18:36 into this, like, thing that does not need
01:18:38 any effort put into it.
01:18:40 Just, like, a basic podcast made about the show.
01:18:42 But the way there was a lot of, you know,
01:18:44 pony expressions been made
01:18:46 far more than it was usually made
01:18:48 for those types of things,
01:18:50 as well as just custom things made for each episode.
01:18:52 There's that one where you guys were fucking
01:18:54 in the night uniforms.
01:18:56 All this different sort of shit going on
01:18:58 that didn't have to be made whatsoever.
01:19:00 And it all added to the experience,
01:19:02 as well as intros, which were so far and above
01:19:04 beyond what anyone was saying.
01:19:06 It's just perfect, because it's so easily digestible,
01:19:08 because there are just, like, keynotes and stuff.
01:19:10 And everyone's on this, like,
01:19:12 this, like, pre-planned path.
01:19:14 That's super easy. There's a table of contents for everything.
01:19:16 It's super easy to digest.
01:19:18 However, it's so fluthy.
01:19:20 It's just, like...
01:19:22 It's just, like, you're on a bus stop, and you're going to each stop.
01:19:24 You don't know exactly what's at stop,
01:19:26 but you have, like, a basic plan for each one.
01:19:28 So you're still, like, free-flowing,
01:19:30 and you can, like, kind of decide what to do
01:19:32 at each given moment.
01:19:34 And the conversation is still, like, natural and free-flowing,
01:19:36 but it's still easily digestible.
01:19:38 And just the entire aesthetic of it being,
01:19:40 you know, this fucking cool thing
01:19:42 that you have to put actual effort into
01:19:44 moving the pony. And it's not a lot of work,
01:19:46 but you just have to move the pony mouths and stuff.
01:19:48 And there's just a lot of stuff going on.
01:19:50 And Phantom Reviews and Keg Reviews are fucking incredible.
01:19:52 And they have so much work in problem
01:19:54 with fucking, like, musical segments. It's incredible.
01:19:56 That's right. They're legendary.
01:19:58 There's so much lore, too, driven in to just these simple reviews.
01:20:00 It's just, like, you and Ben have a really good dynamic
01:20:02 just in general. Yeah, too.
01:20:04 Because, like, when we would drive to BronyCon,
01:20:06 you guys would just get into these heated discussions
01:20:08 about everything, and I'd just be in the backseat listening,
01:20:10 and I'd just be like, I just got a bonus episode of T-Bab.
01:20:12 That's just how you talk.
01:20:14 And it's a good dynamic.
01:20:16 Well, that's cool. Thanks for sucking my dicks, fam.
01:20:18 Yeah, no problem. All my myriad dicks.
01:20:20 That'll be 50 bucks.
01:20:22 Pay Pal now, please.
01:20:24 Hey, here we go.
01:20:26 AtBelity998 asks,
01:20:28 if you could create one new law for America,
01:20:30 what would it be?
01:20:32 Munchy?
01:20:34 No more ghosts.
01:20:36 I'm tired of them.
01:20:38 We got to get them all out.
01:20:40 Like, whenever someone dies, just get, like, a vacuum near them.
01:20:42 Just suck them all up and send them off
01:20:44 to us, outsource them to China, do something with them.
01:20:46 I'm tired of bumping into them on the streets.
01:20:48 I'm trying to, I'm sorry.
01:20:50 I'm so getting sick and tired of my Indian
01:20:52 drink catcher being clogged up
01:20:54 with all the spirits and ghouls constantly
01:20:56 after change every single day.
01:20:58 I hate it. No more ghosts.
01:21:00 We got to give ICE the necessary tools
01:21:02 they need to deport all these fucking ghosts
01:21:04 back to where they came from. The fucking, the fucking grave.
01:21:06 Right back to the fucking...
01:21:08 Well, we have to give ICE the necessary tools
01:21:10 to get all these ghosts out of our fucking property.
01:21:12 No, they need, we need to give ICE
01:21:14 the necessary tools to get these ghosts out of our fucking bodies
01:21:16 by killing all of us.
01:21:18 Yeah.
01:21:20 Hashtag give ISIS nukes.
01:21:22 Let's make it happen everybody.
01:21:24 Official sponsor of the PCP ISIS.
01:21:26 Official PCP partner
01:21:28 of ISIS.
01:21:30 Fucking ISIS.
01:21:32 PCP ISIS, they're both letters.
01:21:34 Oh no!
01:21:36 He did it. It's so true.
01:21:38 It's so true.
01:21:40 What even was the question?
01:21:42 What law would you make?
01:21:44 What law would you make real, if you could?
01:21:46 A Trafalgar Dealer.
01:21:48 Oh no, that's the worst one.
01:21:50 By the way, I don't know if I mentioned this,
01:21:52 but it just so happens that my guy
01:21:54 work with at work,
01:21:56 he has like, whatever,
01:21:58 he just joined, he's like an intern or something,
01:22:00 but he has a little heart pirates logo
01:22:02 as his chat icon
01:22:04 in our work chat, and it just every day
01:22:06 it makes me want to die.
01:22:08 He's a cool guy though, and we talk about one piece,
01:22:10 so he's an idiot, and he should be
01:22:12 purged from existence, he should be
01:22:14 eviscerated.
01:22:16 Indeed, hopefully he doesn't listen to this.
01:22:18 We'll see.
01:22:20 I will be fired, I will be fired.
01:22:22 It will be all up to me.
01:22:24 If that's what gets you fired from the PCP,
01:22:26 I know right, I know right.
01:22:28 Out of everything that's been said,
01:22:30 you have some good job security.
01:22:32 I think we've had the name
01:22:34 Washington DC for too long.
01:22:36 Here's my new proposal, Mecca 2.
01:22:38 The second, the second Mecca 2.
01:22:40 I think that's kind of what we like it or not.
01:22:44 Aka London, London Mecca 2.
01:22:46 It's happening.
01:22:48 Okay, hang on, I want to read,
01:22:50 a quick shout out to
01:22:52 hashtag worst question of the week
01:22:54 at Gabriel underscore freak.
01:22:56 You're getting a shout out, my dude.
01:22:58 What is the best thing for the members
01:23:00 of the TPC?
01:23:02 First of all, he said the TPC.
01:23:04 So you fucked up right there, my dude.
01:23:06 And what's the best thing?
01:23:08 That question is too fucking vague.
01:23:10 Otaku freak Gabriel
01:23:12 to use your full name.
01:23:14 Oh, you should feel ashamed of yourself.
01:23:16 This is a disappointment.
01:23:18 I'm sorry, I'm just kidding dude, you're fine.
01:23:20 He was about to pledge us $50.
01:23:22 Oh, I fucked up. Gabriel, forgive me.
01:23:24 The best thing about the PCP
01:23:26 is spending time with all my buddies.
01:23:30 No, that's...
01:23:32 This gay is not allowed.
01:23:34 The best thing about it is
01:23:36 the paycheck.
01:23:38 He's right.
01:23:40 Can't argue with that.
01:23:42 Speaking of paycheck, why are you asking that?
01:23:44 I thought the question was
01:23:46 what is the best thing
01:23:48 for members of the...
01:23:50 It's not even about the PCB.
01:23:52 What is the best thing for each of us?
01:23:54 The best thing for me...
01:24:00 A very small...
01:24:02 Okay, Lego.
01:24:04 Lego and Minecraft combined.
01:24:06 A very small roll.
01:24:08 You get rolled up.
01:24:10 You get rolled up hardcore.
01:24:12 You get twisted.
01:24:14 That's the best thing to happen.
01:24:16 Dude, how many times have you rolled into your duvet
01:24:18 and become a worm?
01:24:20 Many, many times.
01:24:22 Dude, it's a tradition.
01:24:24 I think I said this before, everyone in Thanksgiving
01:24:26 I turn my shirt into pants
01:24:28 and I wear my pants as a shirt.
01:24:30 That's the best thing for me.
01:24:34 Tom, were you saying something?
01:24:36 No, I was just confirming
01:24:38 that that story is indeed on the books.
01:24:40 Oh, yes.
01:24:42 I don't know what the fuck is the best thing.
01:24:44 I love my...
01:24:46 My Nintendo Switch.
01:24:48 My Nintendo Switch.
01:24:50 See, I hate this question.
01:24:52 I fucking hate you, Gabriel.
01:24:54 My favorite thing is my Surface Pro
01:24:56 because it's a computer and a tablet
01:24:58 at the same time, so you can draw on it,
01:25:00 you can read manga on it really easy,
01:25:02 you can do actual work,
01:25:04 computer work with it,
01:25:06 and it's like a pound and a half,
01:25:08 so it's super light, you can take it anywhere.
01:25:10 Oh, wait, I got it.
01:25:12 It's the best computing device of all time.
01:25:14 Excellent.
01:25:16 My actual best thing,
01:25:18 the best thing for me is
01:25:20 when my computer does not just blue screen and turn off.
01:25:22 It's all the times it's not doing that.
01:25:24 It's the best thing for me, without a doubt.
01:25:26 Guy ever!
01:25:28 Oh!
01:25:30 It's been saved.
01:25:34 Oh, no.
01:25:36 Munchie's out of the piece.
01:25:38 Even though I said it.
01:25:42 Any other questions to the fan chat?
01:25:44 We're getting close to the end here.
01:25:46 The fan chat questions are all terrible.
01:25:48 I have a question for you, fan chat.
01:25:50 Can you make better questions?
01:25:52 You're paying money for this.
01:25:54 Who's the best dancer in the PCP?
01:26:04 They have money, but they don't have wit.
01:26:06 That's for sure.
01:26:08 They replace it.
01:26:10 How all women who are attractive are 0 out of 10 intelligence,
01:26:12 by default.
01:26:14 Dude, I know that. Hardcore.
01:26:16 It's okay, we like it that way.
01:26:18 If you had to choose between money and wit,
01:26:20 we'd definitely appreciate your money.
01:26:22 Agreed.
01:26:24 Tell you what, here's one more question.
01:26:30 At Ramon1234 asks,
01:26:32 what is the most time-consuming element
01:26:34 of each of your jobs?
01:26:36 I don't know if it means like PCP,
01:26:38 or getting ice,
01:26:40 or the fact that ice tries to deport you all the time
01:26:42 for being an alien,
01:26:44 an illegal alien,
01:26:46 violating the sanctity of the American Constitution
01:26:48 by being here.
01:26:50 I'm assuming it's that.
01:26:52 I would say that the most time-consuming
01:26:54 part of my job
01:26:56 is the writing of the script,
01:26:58 because
01:27:00 it takes a while to decide
01:27:02 on when it's done
01:27:04 and how good it is.
01:27:06 Recording and editing.
01:27:08 Actually, no, it's writing slash recording.
01:27:10 Editing is fine.
01:27:12 I can do that fine.
01:27:14 It may take longer,
01:27:16 but there's less time where I'm just fucking around.
01:27:18 Like, I can just do it when I do it.
01:27:20 And for writing, a lot of the time,
01:27:22 I'm just sitting there and I don't know what I'm doing.
01:27:24 And I'm clicking, clacking at the keyboard
01:27:26 and I'm deleting my, you know, my
01:27:28 Internet system 32,
01:27:30 you know, some 64, whatever.
01:27:32 The most time-consuming thing about my job
01:27:34 is whenever I have to press keys
01:27:36 on my keyboard.
01:27:38 When I record and when I draw, it's super easy
01:27:40 and I can't get it done really fast.
01:27:42 But if I have to, like, press down letters
01:27:44 or accumulate
01:27:46 exclamation points,
01:27:48 then we're going to have real problems.
01:27:50 We're going to have some real major problems.
01:27:52 That's going to be the end of my band
01:27:54 by, like, accumulate exclamation points.
01:27:56 That's not bad.
01:27:58 The most time-consuming thing
01:28:00 is editing. I hate it.
01:28:02 And it's doubly time-consuming because it takes
01:28:04 long time and I also hate it.
01:28:06 So I procrastinate on doing it.
01:28:08 That sucks balls.
01:28:10 The most time-consuming thing with 3D
01:28:12 is UV unwrapping.
01:28:14 That's the most time-consuming thing ever.
01:28:16 It's when you take the 3D model once it's done
01:28:18 and you have to, like, put seams in it
01:28:20 and flatten it out like a paper-craft doll
01:28:22 kind of flattens out so you can put the texture on it.
01:28:24 It's really hard because I'm stupid.
01:28:26 Interesting.
01:28:28 Yeah, those both suck balls and I hate it.
01:28:30 That's not just really hard because you're stupid.
01:28:32 That's just really hard because I can't wrap my head
01:28:34 around it when I try to do it.
01:28:36 You can't wrap your head around unwrapping
01:28:38 the...
01:28:40 That's why I said that.
01:28:42 That was very good.
01:28:44 I think that would agree with Gib.
01:28:46 Oh, Midge, go ahead.
01:28:48 Yeah, the most time-consuming thing for me though
01:28:50 is drawing everything out
01:28:52 because I do the animation.
01:28:54 No, no, no, like drawing everything,
01:28:56 every single panel, stuff like that.
01:28:58 Midge, how about that foreshortening, though?
01:29:00 Foreshortening.
01:29:02 Foreshortening's fun.
01:29:04 Guys, I gotta tell you, foreshortening
01:29:06 is a pain for sure.
01:29:08 That's a wrap, guys.
01:29:10 Someone made that joke like a week ago
01:29:12 and I've been wanting to use it ever since.
01:29:14 Do you feel like Midge just steals jokes
01:29:16 and that's what he does and that's why he's famous?
01:29:18 No, no, no. I misspoke.
01:29:20 Like, someone said the word foreshortening
01:29:22 and I've been wanting to make that joke.
01:29:24 That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
01:29:26 That's the truth for sure.
01:29:28 See, I just did what you did.
01:29:30 I stole your joke.
01:29:32 You stole my fucking...
01:29:34 Okay, well, I agree with Gib here
01:29:36 so it might not even be the longest process
01:29:38 because editing does take me a long time,
01:29:40 but specifically,
01:29:42 and I've worked on improving that,
01:29:44 but the writing process,
01:29:46 okay, well with Weagua, which is what I'm doing now,
01:29:48 nothing takes any time
01:29:50 and the thing that takes the most time with that
01:29:52 is just once I've recorded, I have to edit it
01:29:54 and that, for sure, takes the majority of the time.
01:29:56 Once all the footage is captured,
01:29:58 putting it down, putting in the timelines,
01:30:00 doing the color correction, syncing up the audio,
01:30:02 et cetera, et cetera.
01:30:04 That's not Weagua, but the real
01:30:06 bane of my existence is not Weagua
01:30:08 because I can bust that out fairly simple.
01:30:10 In the bigger videos,
01:30:12 my larger projects,
01:30:14 it's the phase
01:30:16 to get the script together.
01:30:18 So all the research,
01:30:20 all the planning, all that kind of stuff
01:30:22 in order to produce the script.
01:30:24 Once I have the script, which I do now, incidentally,
01:30:26 then it's easy mode.
01:30:28 Then I just record it, edit,
01:30:30 oh, it's fucking, it's simple.
01:30:32 It's not required anymore. It just happens.
01:30:34 Like a Weagua does.
01:30:36 It's everything about preparing the project.
01:30:38 It's where both the time investment,
01:30:40 because A, procrastinating,
01:30:42 and the combination with not knowing what the fuck to say
01:30:44 and having to sit there and think about it,
01:30:46 that's the hard shit.
01:30:48 And I'm hoping to get better at it as I go along.
01:30:50 But that's my bane of my existence,
01:30:52 for sure.
01:30:54 I'm pissing into my own rug right now.
01:30:56 My dude, Elias.
01:30:58 You're on me.
01:31:00 What do you got, Munch?
01:31:02 I've said enough about aliens.
01:31:04 I love them.
01:31:06 I love them too.
01:31:08 They are my friends. They are my friends.
01:31:10 Is there a person in here who doesn't believe
01:31:12 that aliens are friends?
01:31:14 Right now, we're gonna decide the PCP,
01:31:16 we're gonna contact Nasta.
01:31:18 Are aliens friends or foes?
01:31:20 We decide right now. I vote friends.
01:31:22 Dude, why the fuck is there not an alien
01:31:24 type in Pokemon?
01:31:26 Oh, that's...
01:31:28 Actually, there's deoxys.
01:31:30 There's Clefairy.
01:31:32 What else do we got?
01:31:34 Jirachi, I think, is from the stars.
01:31:36 Yeah, Jirachi.
01:31:38 Requies us from outside the atmosphere, I think.
01:31:40 That counts. He's green.
01:31:42 Yeah, he's green.
01:31:44 All aliens are Pokemon.
01:31:46 Wait, isn't Starmie canonically
01:31:48 from Outer Space or something?
01:31:50 I think he is.
01:31:52 Alright, that's enough right there.
01:31:54 Maybe Pokemon Uranium addresses this massive flaw.
01:31:56 I think Pokemon Uranium should get annihilated
01:31:58 because it wasn't made by Nintendo
01:32:00 or it shouldn't exist.
01:32:02 Hashtag DCMA, or have you say it,
01:32:04 is perfect.
01:32:06 My favorite thing.
01:32:08 Hashtag legalized DCMA.
01:32:10 We gotta legalize it, everybody.
01:32:12 Make it happen.
01:32:14 I think we're all set.
01:32:16 Anybody final points or anybody?
01:32:18 Kirby's my best alien friend.
01:32:20 Oh, he's a good alien.
01:32:22 He is. And the most powerful.
01:32:24 If you plant it in half, if you look at him sideways,
01:32:26 he doesn't give a fuck about anything.
01:32:28 Lilo and Stitch,
01:32:30 don't let Hawaii
01:32:32 be abducted.
01:32:34 Stop it!
01:32:36 Okay.
01:32:38 Yeah, just letting it happen.
01:32:40 It's very irresponsible.
01:32:42 I don't know what's their
01:32:44 angle.
01:32:46 My closing.
01:32:48 Oh yeah, go ahead, Mage.
01:32:50 What if we are descendants of aliens?
01:32:52 Oh, I was gonna talk about that.
01:32:54 There was a great episode of Ancient Aliens.
01:32:56 It was a great episode of Ancient Aliens
01:32:58 where they're talking about aliens and Bigfoot.
01:33:00 Because that's the thrust of the show.
01:33:02 It's always aliens and something.
01:33:04 And so there was an episode, Aliens and Bigfoot,
01:33:06 and they're talking about how Bigfoot was an alien.
01:33:08 But then they're like, no.
01:33:10 What if, okay,
01:33:12 that aliens, they're never depicted
01:33:14 with any fur.
01:33:16 Bigfoot has fur.
01:33:18 What if Bigfoot was like
01:33:21 a species that existed on Earth
01:33:23 and then they genetically modified them
01:33:25 and they became humans.
01:33:27 So we're genetically modified Bigfoot's.
01:33:29 And the Bigfoot's that exist now
01:33:31 are the natural evolution of species on this planet.
01:33:33 And we've been modified by aliens.
01:33:35 Of course. That makes sense.
01:33:37 And they're like, is it possible?
01:33:39 Maybe!
01:33:41 Why the fuck couldn't they just say,
01:33:44 instead of Bigfoot, just say Gorillaz?
01:33:47 Because Bigfoot is
01:33:49 the missing link between
01:33:51 between Gorillaz
01:33:53 and humans.
01:33:55 Everyone needs to watch the Aliens.
01:33:57 It's going to elevate your Christ consciousness.
01:33:59 You're going to become aware of everything.
01:34:01 Do I need to watch?
01:34:03 Do I need to see Indiana Jones
01:34:05 in the fourth one?
01:34:07 That's like their movie.
01:34:09 And they gave it a budget.
01:34:11 Things got weird.
01:34:13 It definitely has its charm on TV instead.
01:34:15 As we all know,
01:34:17 this is not to discriminate or discredit.
01:34:19 But as we all know,
01:34:21 the Hebrews are aliens and they came
01:34:23 to Limeria
01:34:25 in our mid-evolution cycle.
01:34:27 And they sort of assimilated themselves.
01:34:29 But technically,
01:34:31 all Jews are aliens.
01:34:33 Just throwing that out there.
01:34:35 The Jews are the ultimate vagina aliens.
01:34:37 You know, to drop a little
01:34:39 truth bomb here,
01:34:41 the current science
01:34:43 is inconclusive
01:34:45 as to exactly how
01:34:47 the Jews are human.
01:34:49 No, it's okay.
01:34:51 To whoever's point it was,
01:34:53 maybe it was a major.
01:34:55 I took a geology class
01:34:57 to finish my degree last year
01:34:59 or something.
01:35:01 There was currently
01:35:03 biology.
01:35:05 There was no known way
01:35:07 that the base amino acids
01:35:09 that make up the proteins
01:35:11 that cells in most species
01:35:13 all organisms depend on
01:35:15 in order to function.
01:35:17 The thought right now is that amino acids
01:35:19 were synthesized outside of the planet
01:35:21 and then arrived here later
01:35:23 after it had already turned into
01:35:25 a fucking planet toyed with shit.
01:35:27 And then it just from that collision
01:35:29 as meteors hit here and brought the amino acids here,
01:35:31 they slowly collected and eventually
01:35:33 formed life.
01:35:35 Technically, you can say
01:35:37 everything in the universe is from space
01:35:39 because we're all in space.
01:35:41 We're all from space rocks and shit.
01:35:43 The theory is we're all technically Martians
01:35:45 because they believe it came from Mars.
01:35:47 How did they get here from Mars though?
01:35:49 Was there like an explosion or something?
01:35:51 Like a meteor impact or something like that.
01:35:53 There was a whole big presentation
01:35:55 on it because
01:35:57 I guess Mars at the time
01:35:59 had the conditions necessary
01:36:01 to create those amino acids.
01:36:03 That would explain the dafty duck
01:36:05 with no mouth guide for Mars
01:36:07 in Looney Tunes.
01:36:09 Yeah.
01:36:11 He totally explained him.
01:36:13 Dude, what if the planet of the apes
01:36:15 was an Earth
01:36:17 and the apes were on a different planet
01:36:19 and that was their planet of the apes
01:36:21 and then they continued to be apes in charge
01:36:23 and then they grew their technology
01:36:25 and they made spaceships, they came to Earth
01:36:27 and then they turned into humans over many years.
01:36:31 You're describing literally
01:36:33 the plot of Final Fantasy X.
01:36:35 That is literally what happens
01:36:37 in Final Fantasy X.
01:36:39 Spoiler.
01:36:41 That's what happens in Final Fantasy X too
01:36:43 I should clarify.
01:36:45 That's where the shit gets real.
01:36:47 Alright everybody.
01:36:49 I assume they don't offer that one as well.
01:36:51 Of course, that's the only way they know how.
01:36:53 Alright everybody, that's it. Thank God.
01:36:55 Okay, let's do our plugs here everybody.
01:36:57 Alright, everybody.
01:36:59 Don't smoke.
01:37:01 Don't smoke but go to patreon.com
01:37:03 the procrastinators.
01:37:05 If you've got discords,
01:37:07 pledge some money, be in our discords
01:37:09 where we actually hang out and talk to people.
01:37:11 We do.
01:37:13 You'll get the fuck right in there if you pledge
01:37:15 one fucking dollar.
01:37:17 Slide right the fuck in bro.
01:37:19 If you pledge $5 though,
01:37:21 that's $5 per episode of the PCP
01:37:23 you get access to the bonus episodes
01:37:25 of which I believe there are seven now.
01:37:27 There are seven that exist now, I think.
01:37:29 And the last one is a fucking doozy.
01:37:31 We're getting ready to record another one
01:37:33 that's coming up. It'll be out.
01:37:35 We're trying to get out the first of the month
01:37:37 and so that's when you see that shit
01:37:39 a couple days.
01:37:41 We got some merch.
01:37:43 We got some PCP merch down below.
01:37:45 We actually just added some more to our red bubble page
01:37:47 with a bunch of fucking stickers.
01:37:49 You goddamn cheap motherfucker.
01:37:51 Buy them all.
01:37:53 Stop advertising that corporate
01:37:55 bullshitcompanyapple.com
01:37:57 on the front of your MacBook.
01:37:59 Slap a PCP logo
01:38:01 PCP member.
01:38:03 This machine kills fascists.
01:38:05 This machine promotes fascism
01:38:07 with the PCP sticker on it.
01:38:09 Hell yeah, go on Gil.
01:38:11 There's a sticker for each of us.
01:38:13 They're all drawn by Mage.
01:38:15 Me and Tom are kind of stuck together though.
01:38:17 We're going to be keeping track
01:38:19 of all the ones you buy
01:38:21 so we'll know who the most popular PCP member is
01:38:23 and then we'll kill that person
01:38:25 so I can be the most pop.
01:38:27 What if you're the most?
01:38:29 Tom, we're stuck together
01:38:31 so we'll never know who is the most.
01:38:33 It'll be me and Mage the podcast.
01:38:35 The best podcast of all time.
01:38:37 And also, there is a t-shirt as well.
01:38:39 A t-shirt designed
01:38:41 by someone.
01:38:43 I forget his name.
01:38:45 Edward D. Al.
01:38:47 That's the guy.
01:38:49 Guys, I just realized.
01:38:51 I confirm the aliens are real.
01:38:53 The procrastinators, TPC,
01:38:55 the podcast creators
01:38:57 that's also the same
01:38:59 initial TPC
01:39:01 the podcast creators.
01:39:03 Get it? Because we create podcasts.
01:39:05 What's that going to do with aliens?
01:39:07 I don't know anything
01:39:09 about what the fuck you're talking about right now.
01:39:11 Because they're the same letters?
01:39:13 What are letters?
01:39:15 We need to go back to square one here.
01:39:17 Dumb podcast creators.
01:39:19 When we made
01:39:21 when you said the name.
01:39:23 You fucked it up dude.
01:39:25 You had to say the people creators.
01:39:27 No!
01:39:29 See, that would have made sense.
01:39:31 That would have made sense.
