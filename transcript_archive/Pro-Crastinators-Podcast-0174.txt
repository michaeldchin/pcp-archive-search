00:00:00 Hello, everybody, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's me, Best.
00:00:10 We've also got Worst, aka Ben. Hey, buddy, how's it going?
00:00:15 Shut the fuck up. That's wrong.
00:00:18 Well, you're actually everybody's favorite.
00:00:21 You're spreading wrong information. That's illegal.
00:00:25 They call me the father of lies for just this reason. We've got Endless Jess over here.
00:00:30 Yeah, we've got the best guy, we've got the worst guy, and we've got the medium guy.
00:00:35 Everyone's most electrifying character. We've got Tom Oliver.
00:00:40 Hello, I'm here. The medium rare guy.
00:00:43 Oh, no. There you go.
00:00:47 And we've got Digibro.
00:00:49 Everybody, we've got such a big show for you this week. There's so much news in the world of capitalism and communism.
00:00:56 There's so many political things happening. There's politicals coming out of my eyeballs.
00:01:02 Before we get to all that juicy capitalism communism stuff that everybody loves, let's take it back.
00:01:11 Let's go old school and be mad about a comment.
00:01:14 Okay, sure.
00:01:16 I just saw this come up in my notifications as I was getting ready to do this from last week's show.
00:01:25 Now, most of the comments last week were shitting on Ben, which is fine, but this comment is shitting on me, which is not fine at all.
00:01:32 A lot of angry centrists last week.
00:01:34 Oh, I hate them. I hate them. Pick a side, cowards.
00:01:37 This villain decided that he didn't like me.
00:01:41 So there was one point when we were talking about Nate's dog.
00:01:45 Oh, this one? Yeah.
00:01:47 I said something like...
00:01:49 You were cruelly and viciously roasting my perfectly proportioned, corgi dog.
00:01:52 He's half corgi, it makes sense.
00:01:54 Yes, I remember that.
00:01:55 And I said something ridiculous like...
00:01:57 On his birthday, dare I say.
00:01:59 Okay, I'm sorry.
00:02:01 It was his birthday!
00:02:02 Never let us forget.
00:02:04 You know, I just threw out there like, it doesn't matter.
00:02:07 You know, everyone knows that a dog being fat has no negative impact on its health whatsoever.
00:02:12 Of course.
00:02:13 Obvious sarcasm that everybody understood in the entire world, except for this one commenter who's like,
00:02:19 stupidest comment of the podcast definitely goes to Jesse.
00:02:23 Why does it matter if a dog is fat?
00:02:25 It doesn't affect it in any way?
00:02:27 In parentheses, paraphrased.
00:02:29 So, thanks.
00:02:32 So, I responded to him and I just said, I know, right?
00:02:36 That's almost as stupid as not being able to detect sarcasm.
00:02:40 That was a good one.
00:02:41 And then, just now, 18 minutes ago, he responded to my response.
00:02:47 And he turned so vicious.
00:02:53 He's like a mad dog, you might say.
00:02:55 Yeah, a mad, fat dog.
00:02:58 He goes impotent.
00:03:00 Don't try to save face, dude.
00:03:04 You may be funny, but you're not intelligent.
00:03:09 Your theory finger quotes of anarcho-communism is actually nonsensical.
00:03:19 And not even a political theory you ignoramus.
00:03:23 Learn some philosophy and come back with a systematic approach to politics that isn't just an assertion of facts,
00:03:29 but based on actual proof.
00:03:33 We've gone astray a couple of times.
00:03:38 He's either confused you for me, or he's misquoted anarcho-communism.
00:03:47 All the fucking time is, I know our voices on the PCP are somewhat similar,
00:03:53 but for fuck's sake, if you're gonna have opinions about us, figure out who we are.
00:03:57 You guys implemented visuals.
00:04:00 You can literally watch the clip where you heard us talk.
00:04:03 Look at whose fucking icon is flashing.
00:04:05 Figure out who that guy is.
00:04:07 I'm so sick of people telling me about my opinions on things that are Nate's opinions on things.
00:04:13 God damn it!
00:04:14 We work our fingers to the bone, whipping Oblivionfall to make him give the visual indicators.
00:04:21 Working day and night to whip up these opinions for you.
00:04:26 Just to have you mix them all up in a food processor.
00:04:30 Just as you make whipped cream by taking cream and whipping it really fast,
00:04:34 you take normal decent political discourse and you whip it really fast,
00:04:39 and you turn it into a delicious topping of comedy that you can put on top of anything,
00:04:43 but it's just pearls before swine, I guess.
00:04:46 I don't think that he's mixing us up.
00:04:49 I think he's just a fool.
00:04:51 I think he has just misspoken and was talking about the anarcho-fascism thing.
00:04:56 Yeah.
00:04:57 If you took that exact quote and just replaced it with anarcho-fascism or whatever,
00:05:01 then I would understand, so I think it is simply,
00:05:04 Occam's razor, I think he simply made a mistake.
00:05:07 He's simply trying to break down the capitalistic allegory of the overloaded dog.
00:05:12 Everybody knows about that theory.
00:05:14 It's so common.
00:05:15 Yes, people.
00:05:16 Anarcho-fascism is obviously absurd.
00:05:19 It's called anarcho-fascism.
00:05:21 It's funny because the other definition is equally absurd.
00:05:26 Yeah.
00:05:27 The definition that I found was like some weird racist shit.
00:05:31 Well, yeah.
00:05:32 It's fascism.
00:05:33 I looked up the definition of fascism just to be sure,
00:05:37 and whoever said it, Mussolini or something, didn't bring up racism,
00:05:42 so I'm assuming that Mussolini is a pretty smart guy about most things.
00:05:46 I would also defer to Mussolini on most issues.
00:05:51 I don't know.
00:05:52 He's probably one of the experts.
00:05:53 I don't know.
00:05:54 Maybe it needs a different name, like anarcho-tyranny or something.
00:05:56 I don't know.
00:05:57 But the whole point of it is to be absurd and to argue with people
00:06:01 and convince myself of it, which is even more funny,
00:06:04 because when I start arguing and articulating,
00:06:07 I can almost believe it and I go,
00:06:10 cool, this is stupid.
00:06:12 Did we mention on the PCP that time?
00:06:14 It's not anarcho-communism.
00:06:15 Did we mention on the show the time that Jim Carrey was shitting on Mussolini on Twitter
00:06:20 and then Mussolini's granddaughter came and was telling him a piece of shit?
00:06:24 That was crazy.
00:06:25 That was fucking hilarious.
00:06:26 I was reminding everybody that happened.
00:06:28 What he did, what he did, and this is kind of understandable,
00:06:31 what Jim Carrey actually did was, you know Jim Carrey's gotten into art and painting and stuff?
00:06:35 What he did was, he painted a picture of Mussolini,
00:06:39 and I think it was his wife or his current lady or whatever it was,
00:06:43 and he drew, he painted them being hung from their feet after being assassinated or whatever,
00:06:49 and Mussolini's granddaughter was like, this is pretty fucked up.
00:06:53 And of course you understand both sides,
00:06:55 not a big fan of Mussolini, most people.
00:06:57 Also his literal granddaughter is probably going to have some feelings.
00:07:00 I mean, that was what made it so great.
00:07:02 I don't know if I was Mussolini's granddaughter,
00:07:05 I don't know if I'd really want to be out there on social media
00:07:09 sticking my neck out, dying on the hill of, let's defend my grandfather's honor.
00:07:15 It takes balls to defend your family when your family is Mussolini.
00:07:20 It does.
00:07:21 It does.
00:07:23 I would want to be in the camp of, hey, I'm not like my grandfather, I'm a cool Mussolini.
00:07:30 I'm taking it back.
00:07:32 Yeah, exactly.
00:07:34 So I don't know if I agree with her tactic on this one.
00:07:37 Well fuck her, she didn't make Ace Ventura.
00:07:39 Gotta make Mussolini great again.
00:07:41 Hey, you know what I did recently?
00:07:44 I watched the Boba Duke, and I've gotta say, it was a cinematic masterpiece,
00:07:49 and I was in fact Boba Duke spooked consistently the whole time.
00:07:52 It's such a Boba Duke spooky movie.
00:07:54 One more can you ask for it?
00:07:56 You know, there was really an amazing arc in that movie.
00:07:58 I guess slight spoilers for people, but it was just Nate Movie Guy
00:08:02 weighing in once again on the new movie he saw.
00:08:05 It starts off with this mother and child who are, like this weird hyperactive,
00:08:11 possibly kind of a genius, but he creates all kinds of problems.
00:08:14 He makes all these weird tactics and stratagems to fuck up his mom's life
00:08:19 and make her miserable because he's too hyperactive and their dad died or something.
00:08:24 He starts the movie as the clear villain, but by the end,
00:08:28 he becomes the Macaulay Culkin fucking trap genius
00:08:32 fighting against a literal demon attempting to murder his mom and himself.
00:08:36 And I was team kid, I did not expect to be,
00:08:40 but kid proved to be such a fucking badass in that movie, and it was great.
00:08:44 And then they make peace with the demon in the basement,
00:08:47 and he just lives there now, and they feed him worms to placate his rage.
00:08:51 I guess it's like a metaphor.
00:08:52 It's the best interpretation of that movie I've ever heard.
00:08:55 I mean, like most people try to go nerdwriter about it and be like,
00:08:59 the Babadook is a metaphor for depression, and we see at the end,
00:09:03 she's learned to lock her depression up.
00:09:05 She can never truly get rid of it, but she's learned to,
00:09:08 and you're just over there like, ah, that didn't become friends with the Babadook,
00:09:10 and he lives in the basement.
00:09:12 It's fucking dope, right?
00:09:15 I know writers who've used subtext, they're all cowards.
00:09:18 Sometimes the service level is the only level.
00:09:23 That's my motto.
00:09:24 In fact, that's mostly the case.
00:09:26 Anyway, it was great, and I very much enjoyed it.
00:09:29 I recommend it to everyone.
00:09:30 The Babadooks are great.
00:09:31 And also check out, what was it, Jesse's Dark Souls 2?
00:09:34 Oh, that's where you're the Babadook.
00:09:36 Yeah, check out the Babadook and the sequel.
00:09:39 Oh yeah, the continuing adventures of the Babadook in the Babadook.
00:09:42 There's so many chapters of that saga now.
00:09:45 It's gone from Dark Souls 2 to Dark Souls 1 to Dark Souls 3,
00:09:48 back to Dark Souls 1 Remastered.
00:09:50 The Babadooks pooxpen everywhere.
00:09:52 What channel is that on again?
00:09:54 I forget which of your channels.
00:09:55 I upload them all on the Blue Glow.
00:09:57 They're all unlisted, because most of them are Patreon exclusives.
00:10:00 Oh, I see.
00:10:01 What I'm doing with the Blue Glow is that I'm just stockpiling unlisted videos
00:10:05 until I have enough to release a video every week for the rest of time.
00:10:09 Nice.
00:10:11 It's a good method of doing that, actually.
00:10:14 I've had many times where I tried to be like,
00:10:17 alright, I'm going to fucking schedule a video to come out every week forever,
00:10:22 but I have to make like 52 videos initially to cover the whole year.
00:10:26 And so I will set about trying to do that and make like 10,
00:10:30 and then I'll have 10 weeks of videos and it's great,
00:10:32 but releasing them to just patrons is a better way of going about it,
00:10:36 because then you're still making money off of it.
00:10:38 Yeah, someday I will come out and be like,
00:10:40 hey, everybody, guess what? The Blue Glow is every fucking week now,
00:10:43 and everyone will love me,
00:10:45 and everyone will finally get to see the entire saga of Babadook Spook.
00:10:49 But until then, Patreon.com slash endless jests and fuck shit.
00:10:54 I have already kept up with the saga of Babadook Spook.
00:10:58 You just have to keep playing Dark Souls forever,
00:11:00 because that way no one will ever realize that they've all been made 10 years ago.
00:11:03 It's like, why is he playing 10-year-old games?
00:11:05 Because Dark Souls, duh.
00:11:07 You can mod yourself, you can mod the Babadook into perhaps,
00:11:09 well, Bloodborne, I'm sure there's some Babadook Spook stuff you could do.
00:11:12 In Sekiro, you could definitely mod in some Babadook.
00:11:15 You see the mod the guy made for Bloodborne,
00:11:17 where you can control the enemies and play as all the enemy characters?
00:11:20 No, that sounds sick.
00:11:21 Yeah, it keeps popping up on Twitter, it looks fucking rad.
00:11:23 Apparently, like the way the debug mode in Bloodborne was designed
00:11:27 is that all the enemies work like playable characters,
00:11:30 so he just like brought that to the forefront,
00:11:32 so you can just play as enemies in the game now.
00:11:34 Does that include bosses by any chance?
00:11:36 I don't know, but I would assume so.
00:11:38 I'm gonna play as the one reborn and lumber around and like puke on enemies and shit.
00:11:42 That would be insane.
00:11:43 You're fucking sick.
00:11:44 Yeah.
00:11:45 People are gonna be like, hey, why are Jess and Digi playing Tomb Raider fucking
00:11:50 and talking about Ratton 2?
00:11:52 Tomb Raider 2.
00:11:55 We're just reminiscing, that's all, wink, wink.
00:11:58 Jesse, we lost like all that Luigi footage, right?
00:12:01 I have the files, but I like cannot get them converted on any program.
00:12:06 They're like just a weird file type that I can't get to work anywhere.
00:12:09 It's fucking mega unfortunate.
00:12:11 We have like 20 hours of us playing fucking New Super Luigi bros that like,
00:12:15 for some reason cannot work.
00:12:17 Someday, the world will see them.
00:12:19 I'm dedicated to it.
00:12:20 It's like how you have to put a person who has like terminal cancer to cryostasis
00:12:24 until the technology has to save them in a thousand years.
00:12:27 Man, speaking of computers, messing up my entire life by not working properly
00:12:32 and file types being weird.
00:12:34 I spent like all of this month because I finally got my computer like set up
00:12:38 in my nice cozy little office.
00:12:40 And so I was working on a big like a vlog project video.
00:12:46 It was like, it was gonna be like a classic endless Jess style video where it starts
00:12:50 as just a weird bit and a vlog and then it spirals out of control
00:12:54 into some complex three hour nightmare that nobody should ever want to watch.
00:12:59 And I was making that I was filming it all month for my for my friendly patrons.
00:13:04 And I was just, I just, I can't do it now because like something about the file,
00:13:09 I filmed it on the webcam of my laptop, all of it.
00:13:12 And something about the file when it's in Sony Vegas,
00:13:15 Sony Vegas immediately crashes every time I open it.
00:13:19 And like, it'll let me work on it for like five minutes and then it'll crash.
00:13:24 And it's just like, okay, video is not that good.
00:13:26 I give up.
00:13:27 Fuck it.
00:13:28 I'm sorry.
00:13:29 I'm just gonna throw this out here.
00:13:30 Because I recently, after years and years of Unison Vegas,
00:13:33 I discovered, if maybe this is something similar,
00:13:37 that if I simply put too many MOV files in one Sony Vegas project,
00:13:43 the whole thing simply stops working and will eventually, I think it crashes.
00:13:47 So maybe if too many MOV files, I don't know.
00:13:50 That's possible.
00:13:51 Who knows.
00:13:52 Hey, give it a try.
00:13:53 Maybe it's, maybe.
00:13:54 Handbrake, handbrake, all to MP4.
00:13:56 Oh, no.
00:13:57 I try to handbrake.
00:13:59 Like I turned them all into MP4s to get them to play.
00:14:02 But even then, they're like bad MP4s.
00:14:05 They just kill it.
00:14:07 I've had issues like this.
00:14:09 Vegas is fucking terrible.
00:14:12 I know everybody just uses Vegas because I recommended it way back
00:14:16 because that was what I used.
00:14:17 But everybody's always like, why do you use Vegas?
00:14:19 It's fucking terrible.
00:14:20 Go learn Premiere.
00:14:21 And I'm like, but it looks hard.
00:14:23 It does look hard.
00:14:24 It is hard.
00:14:25 I used it just the other day.
00:14:26 It's not that hard.
00:14:27 Okay.
00:14:28 It's not that hard.
00:14:29 Okay.
00:14:30 Specifically with Premiere.
00:14:31 I thought you were a Premiere user.
00:14:32 I didn't know you were using Vegas.
00:14:33 No.
00:14:34 I have used it here and there.
00:14:35 In fact, just the other day.
00:14:36 I've seen you do things that I didn't think you could do in Vegas.
00:14:39 Well, that is true.
00:14:40 But like I've just kind of gotten a lease.
00:14:42 I've always meant to transition to Premiere like long term.
00:14:45 I just never summoned the testicular fortitude to, you know, put in the effort to make the
00:14:50 transition.
00:14:51 I used it for a good long time back in the day.
00:14:54 I don't know.
00:14:55 I think TBAP stuff.
00:14:56 But like, I was just the other day.
00:14:58 All right.
00:14:59 I was doing a little fucking around at Premiere trying to do something.
00:15:01 And I was just trying to like copy a section.
00:15:04 And it was like, like, okay, I have, I drop in a track.
00:15:06 I cut it at a certain point.
00:15:08 That's reasonably easy to do.
00:15:09 But to try to copy one section of footage proved impossible.
00:15:14 I could not figure out how to do it other than to like, I cut off the section I wanted.
00:15:19 I moved it aside in the track.
00:15:21 Then I like re-dragged out the piece that I had cut off from the original piece, cut
00:15:27 it again, and then like dragged it over so I could work with like the second piece.
00:15:31 Control C, control V.
00:15:33 I tried control C.
00:15:34 I'm pretty sure I tried that.
00:15:36 I don't know.
00:15:37 Maybe I fucked up.
00:15:38 It sucks.
00:15:39 I'm pretty sure that works.
00:15:40 I'm pretty sure that works.
00:15:41 I was giving you the most, the scoffest scoff I have ever heard.
00:15:44 Okay.
00:15:45 I'll give you another thing.
00:15:46 I'm just very confused.
00:15:47 I know that this doesn't work in Premiere though.
00:15:48 I haven't used the new version of Premiere, so maybe they changed it.
00:15:51 I mean, that's an Adobe thing to do to just, they changed all their hotkeys in like last
00:15:56 year and everyone was pissed.
00:15:57 Here's something though.
00:15:58 Here's something that Vegas can do and is unironically superior to what Premiere does.
00:16:03 And it's that if you've got two video files in Vegas on the same video track and you drag
00:16:09 to overlap them, Premiere just doesn't let you.
00:16:12 And it's like kind of annoying and it sucks.
00:16:14 What Vegas will do is instantly overlap them and fade between them automatically.
00:16:19 Now that is convenient.
00:16:21 Premiere just doesn't do that and it sucks.
00:16:24 It's insane that it doesn't do that.
00:16:25 Man, I don't.
00:16:26 You have to like manually create a fade on both tracks and put one on a separate.
00:16:29 Alright, we gotta stop talking about this.
00:16:30 I don't understand any program.
00:16:31 Alright, it's gonna hurt the fuck we're talking about.
00:16:32 It's fine, fine.
00:16:33 You know, it's the same, it's the same horrid fear that I have every time that I'm like,
00:16:36 I'm looking at my desktop and I think, I'm gonna try to make a dope rap beat on Fruity
00:16:41 Loops and I open it up and I look at it and I go, no.
00:16:45 This isn't a real, this is not a real program.
00:16:47 No one actually uses this.
00:16:48 I don't believe it.
00:16:49 This is bullshit.
00:16:51 It's like looking at a system of like steam work pipes and like organs like controlled
00:16:56 by instruments and shit.
00:16:57 Like Fruity Loops is one of the least like intuitive to look at out of the box programs
00:17:02 I've ever seen.
00:17:03 And like the only reason I figured out how to use it is that I watched my brother's
00:17:06 shade do it.
00:17:07 But I'm also retarded with programs like the fucking May has been using Vegas for a while
00:17:12 and she's planning to start using Premiere on her new laptop.
00:17:15 But like, but like she found things that you could do that I have been using this program
00:17:20 for seven fucking years that didn't know like basic things that she figured out it could
00:17:24 do.
00:17:25 So I'm just like, okay, well, because I don't think about, and I know Tom, you're a tech
00:17:30 guy and you said something that kind of blew my mind one time when you were like, yeah,
00:17:34 like if there's a problem that I run into in tech, I assume that there's a solution
00:17:39 and try to find the solution, like, you know, and then like give up if I can't find it.
00:17:44 Like my methodology has always been, I just, I just work with what I know to work.
00:17:51 You know, like I don't go and say, oh, I want to do this.
00:17:54 Let me figure out how I go.
00:17:56 What can I do that I know how to do?
00:17:59 And then I do that, you know, it's interesting how these thought process, if you look at
00:18:03 our videos, they're informed by these thought processes and our approach, very, very simplistic
00:18:09 stuff.
00:18:10 I mean, I will throw like, if I can't figure out how to do something, if I do have on
00:18:13 the rare occasion, I have like an idea.
00:18:16 If I can't figure out how to do it in like 10 minutes, I throw it away.
00:18:19 I'm just like, yeah, fuck it, you know, it's also like, it's, it's, it's lazier, but it's
00:18:24 also funnier to do it bad at this point that's like, I worked for so many years to like learn
00:18:29 how to do things right and how to edit well.
00:18:31 And then like now I look at it and like, yeah, but it's funnier if I edit poorly.
00:18:35 So I just like throw it literally prefer poorly edited.
00:18:39 Like goofy things cause they seem self aware and cute and charming as opposed to like visual
00:18:44 effects, art history, but there is like, which looks phony on Kenny Valley shit.
00:18:48 There is like no beat making programs that I will ever understand the, the only good
00:18:54 one, the, the classic program that I used to make all my great music and rap beats on
00:19:00 was a program called magic's music maker 16.
00:19:05 And that's where I made the butt chugger beat and the reapers beat and all those classic
00:19:09 tunes that everyone loves.
00:19:11 I, you know, and it was like, it's like considered by people a bad program because it's not like,
00:19:19 I don't know, I guess you can't do all the fancy like actual producers shit, but all
00:19:22 it was, it's just like a shitload of genres and samples from like every conceivable genre
00:19:29 of music.
00:19:30 And you just click and drag the samples and build them on top of each other and build
00:19:33 what you want.
00:19:34 It's like musical lego.
00:19:35 That's exactly what the, on max, they have something called garage band that like often
00:19:40 just comes at new max and it's exactly like that.
00:19:43 It was so intuitive and so fucking easy to use.
00:19:48 And I made beats on it that people remember and love.
00:19:50 Everybody loves the butt chugger beat.
00:19:52 Everybody loves reapers.
00:19:53 And so like, I, I've always wanted to like recapture that magic, but like the program
00:19:58 is so old that it doesn't work on like new computers.
00:20:01 I've even, I've gone back on Amazon and like, I've bought the program again on a disc and
00:20:05 tried to get it to install on my new computer and like, it just doesn't work right.
00:20:09 It always is fucked up now.
00:20:11 So I have to use fruity loops, which doesn't work.
00:20:14 So I give up.
00:20:15 That's a talent that I no longer have, I guess, because they took away my Legos.
00:20:19 I got to these roblox.
00:20:24 It's just not the same.
00:20:25 Yeah.
00:20:26 Have you seen this video?
00:20:30 Maybe.
00:20:31 You know, Diplo blocks, something, uh, those, those big ones, this one, Diplo musician.
00:20:36 I don't.
00:20:37 I don't.
00:20:38 Duplo.
00:20:39 Duplo.
00:20:40 Yeah.
00:20:41 That's the one.
00:20:42 That's the one.
00:20:43 Or Lego Technics or Mega Blocks.
00:20:44 Mega.
00:20:45 Or Playmobile.
00:20:46 That's more like it.
00:20:47 Hey, speaking of Mega Blocks.
00:20:49 Bionicle.
00:20:50 Oh, do you?
00:20:51 Speaking of Bionicle, you know what we should do?
00:20:53 Buy Greenland.
00:20:54 This is a proposal that we should a hundred percent as a nation do.
00:20:58 Don't we already own Greenland?
00:21:00 No.
00:21:01 Denmark owns it.
00:21:02 We already own the entire world.
00:21:03 The rest of the world doesn't realize it yet.
00:21:04 I thought we were going to sell Greenland to Denmark.
00:21:07 The quite the contrary.
00:21:09 I don't think it's going to happen.
00:21:10 I'm just saying we should definitely do it because it sounds sick.
00:21:14 Yeah.
00:21:15 And Greenland is really big.
00:21:16 So I saw Trump tweeted that the Denmark lady didn't want to, didn't want to do it.
00:21:21 Very true.
00:21:22 But we got to put the squeeze on her somehow.
00:21:23 Didn't the Denmark lady said she doesn't even have the authority to do that?
00:21:26 I don't know.
00:21:27 I did not look into this.
00:21:28 It's, it's real estate.
00:21:29 I was too busy responding to some idiot on Twitter to pay attention to this.
00:21:32 It's real estate.
00:21:33 If we invade with the military, it'll basically be free real estate.
00:21:37 We can make it free.
00:21:38 We can make it free.
00:21:39 Is there a reason we actually would want Greenland?
00:21:41 Maybe.
00:21:42 Okay.
00:21:43 Like literally all I know about Greenland is that everyone kills themselves there.
00:21:46 One, it's sick.
00:21:47 Okay.
00:21:48 Two, there's some bullshit about like the ISIS thawing and it might improve shipping
00:21:53 routes.
00:21:54 I don't care about that shit.
00:21:55 I just want to buy fucking Greenland.
00:21:57 It would be sick.
00:21:58 I could go there.
00:21:59 I think that we're, we're, we want it because like the, like global warming has made it
00:22:04 a better place.
00:22:05 Like, is that real?
00:22:06 Well, not now, but the, the theory is that in time that will do so.
00:22:09 Isn't the North Pole, Greenland is like kind of the North Pole because the actual North
00:22:14 Pole, you can't stand there because it's water and ice.
00:22:18 Something like that.
00:22:19 Yeah.
00:22:20 Yeah.
00:22:21 But Greenland, the northern most point of Greenland is like where Santa probably hangs
00:22:23 out.
00:22:24 Oh, if we, if we control Christmas, we control the world.
00:22:29 That's what he's doing.
00:22:31 Exactly.
00:22:32 It's tactically beneficial.
00:22:33 The thought that like Santa would reside in the country with like the highest suicide
00:22:38 rate in the world is really sad.
00:22:43 Why do you think he does Christmas is to keep him from offing himself?
00:22:45 He has to give himself purpose.
00:22:47 He's probably like one of those like evil horror movie Santas like rare exports or the
00:22:51 Bill Goldberg one Santa's sleigh and sleigh is spelled S L A Y.
00:22:57 Yes.
00:22:58 Nate, I saw this video the other day.
00:23:03 Have you seen this?
00:23:04 It's a video about Tifa and it's by some like, it's a, it's like a real lefty boy
00:23:10 who clearly has never played a video game in his fucking life.
00:23:15 The video is called the outrage is about control, not breasts.
00:23:20 And it's a 20 minute video of him like calling everybody in cells and not understanding shit
00:23:25 about fuck.
00:23:26 Of course.
00:23:27 And he like rambles about like institutionalized racism for like 10 minutes, which has nothing
00:23:31 to fucking do with anything.
00:23:32 Is that like cause a barrette or something?
00:23:33 Is that?
00:23:34 No, he just has no idea what he's taught.
00:23:35 He's just like spewing the talking points that he knows in relation to every single
00:23:39 topic, even when it has nothing to do with them.
00:23:42 You and I just aren't the target audience because we actually play a big game.
00:23:45 But the reason I bring it up is because right in the beginning of the video, he uses your
00:23:48 tweet as an example of like stupid in cells on the internet.
00:23:52 You know, quite a few people used my initial tweet about like, I think, I would, I would
00:23:56 I was pretty, pretty extreme, but I was like extremely disappointed about them nerfing
00:24:00 TV, blah, blah, blah.
00:24:02 He has like, he has like your tweet next to a bunch of like clips, like a bunch of images
00:24:07 from 4chan people saying like, we should mass murder Square Enix and that's right in the
00:24:13 middle of those.
00:24:14 I've been good company boys.
00:24:16 I'm the, what I'm the crypto fascist to their, you know, full on fascist.
00:24:20 Oh God, that I'm glad that we're bringing that up.
00:24:23 Somebody told me in my, in my discord that like, that their friends were like, we're
00:24:30 like, oh Digi bro, that guy is a crypto fascist.
00:24:34 And I was like, what in the name of fuck is that?
00:24:38 And where do I sign up to be one?
00:24:40 Cause it sounds awesome.
00:24:41 It sounds sick.
00:24:42 It sounds like the coolest thing to be.
00:24:44 It's not as, it's, it's not as cool as you think.
00:24:46 No, apparently it just means it's actually worse than a rate.
00:24:49 It's actually lame or than a regular fascist.
00:24:52 I guess, I guess like sends subliminal messages out to people.
00:24:58 I just, I just, every time I hear a fascist who won't admit it.
00:25:02 Okay.
00:25:03 I just, it just to me, it sounds like a fascist who's really into Bitcoin is like waiting
00:25:06 for the market to swing up again.
00:25:08 You would hope.
00:25:09 You would hope.
00:25:10 So I think it's, they could be as well.
00:25:12 I think they just like to put crypto on things now.
00:25:15 Like crypto is one of those, he's just like, he's a hardcore fascist for bitcoins.
00:25:19 Like fuck Ethereum.
00:25:20 That shit is gay.
00:25:21 None of that lefty eats in my presence, Bitcoin cash only.
00:25:25 Here's the thing.
00:25:26 It's that punk as a suffix is no longer interesting.
00:25:30 Like nobody cares about being punk anymore.
00:25:32 Everybody wants to be crypto.
00:25:33 What if you're a crypto punk?
00:25:34 You want to go into the internet.
00:25:35 So you have to be, oh my God.
00:25:36 I don't think you want to be crypto.
00:25:37 My mind is fucking blown.
00:25:38 Crypto punk.
00:25:39 Crypto punk dude.
00:25:40 Crypto punk.
00:25:41 Crypto punk would be like a, I don't know, like a business guy who wears like a
00:25:51 suit and stuff, but then like, he's like secretly, he's like a revolutionary or something.
00:25:56 He's like secretly in a rock band.
00:25:58 He's wearing like a suit, a suit coat, but underneath it, it's like a t-shirt with an
00:26:02 alien giving the peace sign and like smoking a fat dub.
00:26:06 And he's got like a, he's got like a bandana around his head.
00:26:08 He like wears a suit all day, but like he has like sleeves all the way down like his
00:26:13 arms.
00:26:14 He just hides them with his suit.
00:26:15 He's like, yeah.
00:26:16 Yeah.
00:26:17 Crypto punk happening.
00:26:18 Real trademarked.
00:26:19 Kind of neat.
00:26:21 To that, to that guy in that video, I mean, you know, I totally understand on a surface
00:26:26 level why people complaining about a minor character detail being changed seems superfluous
00:26:32 and unnecessary.
00:26:33 I get it.
00:26:34 I expected fully people like on the video I made about it to like not care and think
00:26:37 I'm an incel and a dumbass.
00:26:39 That's fine.
00:26:40 That's fine.
00:26:41 But I don't know.
00:26:42 I just, it's just that they don't care.
00:26:43 And I do.
00:26:44 He's taking a very specific outrage and he's applying it to his idea of the world.
00:26:50 And like he's clearly not a guy who fucking like loved this game and doesn't, he doesn't
00:26:56 understand it.
00:26:57 Like people just don't want shit change.
00:26:58 People don't like remakes.
00:26:59 That's like, what's.
00:27:00 This is my.
00:27:01 What's the more believable answer that everyone, whether they know it or not, is secretly hates
00:27:07 women and doesn't want like the power to balance in the direction of women or that people just
00:27:13 don't like remakes and don't want shit changed.
00:27:16 Right.
00:27:17 I mean, you'd think people wouldn't be.
00:27:18 Well, okay.
00:27:19 I mean, people wouldn't like Tifa because she is literally a strong independent woman,
00:27:22 but she does spend a lot of the game fawning on cloud to be fair.
00:27:25 Yeah.
00:27:26 But I hate the notion that that is not a strong female character.
00:27:30 I mean, that that's very like a strong female character nowadays is basically a strong male
00:27:35 character.
00:27:36 Like they can't do anything traditionally female at all.
00:27:39 They can't.
00:27:40 It does raise the question of what, what is a feminine way to be as opposed to a masculine
00:27:44 way to be.
00:27:45 And I'm not sure what.
00:27:46 I mean, like it just feels like an overcorrection in general, you know, when it's like women
00:27:50 are different and certain feminine traits can also be strong and cool.
00:27:56 They're not like abnormal, but they these when people want like strong female characters
00:28:00 to not have any flaws, it's like they're overcorrecting to such a degree that they're
00:28:04 making the character weird and unrelatable because they're not acting like a fucking
00:28:08 woman.
00:28:10 I mean, true.
00:28:11 Now none of this necessarily applies to Tifa because we haven't played the game, but you
00:28:14 know, these are these are the general concerns of people.
00:28:17 Hey, what can you do?
00:28:19 She has to get pregnant and have a baby and and like have a, it's been the whole game
00:28:25 with like one of those like front backpacks that hold your baby in it every battle.
00:28:30 Yeah.
00:28:31 And she has to be a single mother protecting her baby.
00:28:34 She has to and she has to give birth to it without screaming or crying at all.
00:28:38 Just totally stoic.
00:28:39 I don't know.
00:28:40 I don't know.
00:28:41 That's too traditionally feminine.
00:28:42 She also has to be a techno billionaire.
00:28:44 I don't think she'll have to like found a startup corporation.
00:28:47 I don't think like much of modern feminism angle usually paints like like even the character
00:28:52 as a mother.
00:28:53 I think like motherhood is seen as like two.
00:28:55 Oh, she has to be a mom.
00:28:56 It's very stereotypical.
00:28:57 Yeah.
00:28:58 Yeah.
00:28:59 Agreed.
00:29:00 The whole mom thing.
00:29:01 Well, on the opposite side of the being a mom is cliche now in modern cultures on the
00:29:06 office.
00:29:07 You know, there's, I don't know if I said this before, but there's one extremely hilarious
00:29:10 lefty tweet I saw that I actually thought was incredible from, I don't know, some girl.
00:29:15 I don't remember her name, but she was just like, like, mother gives birth to female child
00:29:21 father.
00:29:22 You know, I just feel like it's kind of pandering to have these like female children.
00:29:25 It's just like playing into the, it's an overcorrection at this point.
00:29:29 You know what I'm saying?
00:29:30 Why did it have to be a female?
00:29:31 Why did you have to make this political?
00:29:33 Yeah.
00:29:34 Well, on the, on the opposite side of this baby is SJW propaganda.
00:29:40 On the other side of the insane people who take everything too seriously coin, I also
00:29:45 found like the opposite of that video.
00:29:48 And it was like, uh, it was a, like a real, it was like a real right wing guy, I guess.
00:29:55 Yeah.
00:29:56 He was, the channel was called blackpilled.
00:29:57 So that should tell you, he was talking about the, he was talking about the movie, the stepford
00:30:04 wives and how like, you know, it was made by Jews and it's secretly propaganda to make
00:30:09 women not want to be housewives and manufacture that, manufacture unhappiness and the American
00:30:14 female and all that stuff.
00:30:15 And he's like, and he's just like every single thing that happens in the movie, he's like,
00:30:20 he's going through how it like is propaganda to make women unhappy and think they have to
00:30:24 rise up against men or hate men or something.
00:30:27 But like, it was equally hilarious because like, even if like, I don't know, like one
00:30:32 in every five points is coherent, but like, he's so, he was so angry about it.
00:30:38 He was so disgusted by this, by this old horror movie.
00:30:41 That's just, you know, I, for one, am glad that the Jews are manufacturing discontent
00:30:46 among women since it's our main cultural export.
00:30:51 It's never been more profitable.
00:30:52 It's our bread and butter.
00:30:53 I mean, like, I don't know, even if it was true and I agreed with every word of it, uh,
00:30:58 I mean, if, if making propaganda to make women unhappy results in like cool old horror movies
00:31:03 then go right the fuck ahead.
00:31:05 Uh, yeah, pretty much, pretty much.
00:31:08 If making women unhappy is wrong, I don't want to be right.
00:31:14 If sowing discord between the sexes and destabilizing society is wrong.
00:31:20 That guy's argument, just going by what you presented just now is like, uh, like obviously
00:31:26 the movie is born out of the fact that like, there are some women who feel like pressured
00:31:31 to be this way and they want to present that like the horror of that, like to, to suggest
00:31:36 that it's like a weird Jewish propaganda.
00:31:39 It's like, no, it's just relatable.
00:31:40 Like, yeah, I mean, like, I do believe that everything is propaganda to destroy society.
00:31:49 I'm just smart enough not to say the word Jew because that's what you get in trouble.
00:31:54 We all know what I mean, but I just don't say it.
00:31:58 Uh, you gotta be like John Tron and say global elites.
00:32:01 Yeah, that's the way we all know that all kinds of a parentheses, parentheses, parentheses,
00:32:06 people make movies, you know?
00:32:09 Yeah, I mean, like I'm probably, I'm probably, uh, it, uh, in the case of a total crypto
00:32:16 fascist, those crypto fascist black pillars that would be crypto fascism.
00:32:21 Right.
00:32:21 Like the, the, I mean, like, he didn't, just the crypto anarcho fascist.
00:32:27 I'm just everything.
00:32:28 Just keep tacking on words.
00:32:30 Keep tacking on labels until I have encompassed all labels.
00:32:33 And that's how I'll finally destroy labels.
00:32:35 Crystal, Eiko, Anarka, uh, when, when everyone is every label, nobody is any label.
00:32:43 Black pills, blue pills, more pills than your body.
00:32:46 I'm just the fucking pill bottle over here.
00:32:48 I hold them all.
00:32:50 I, yeah, the guy didn't come off like totally retarded or stupid or anything, but like
00:32:54 just the fact that he was so into this and so mad about it was the funny.
00:32:58 You know, it's, uh, uh, this just reminds me it's pretty much whenever we, we, we look
00:33:03 at any media we consume through our own particular lens.
00:33:05 And it's just natural that we get out of it.
00:33:08 The things that we want to, uh, I don't know, like, like, it's interesting to
00:33:12 know, like the way that I watched Garin log and compared to those guys I talked
00:33:15 about last time, they got a totally different message and everyone's going
00:33:17 to be like that with everything.
00:33:19 I see the Babadook and I see, yes, I do hate children.
00:33:21 And then it turns around and it says, wait, children can be good.
00:33:24 And I'm like, well, now I'm just confused.
00:33:25 I don't know what I'm supposed to believe anymore.
00:33:28 Uh, I speak, speaking of the shonen Ronan, I like how he bombed into our
00:33:31 comment section on the last episode to say, to say that Ben was right about
00:33:35 everything and we were all retarded.
00:33:38 And I'm assuming Ben logged into the, the TPC account and
00:33:42 favorited the comment because it has a heart on it.
00:33:44 I just happened to be logged in the only comment with a heart on it.
00:33:49 He said, he said, he said, he said someone called the why, one of the, I forget
00:33:55 which of the two like lefty current videos, but he said someone called it Ben
00:33:59 St. Corp and it was the highest compliment that they could receive.
00:34:02 And he was correct.
00:34:04 I, uh, you know, what's up, shonen Ronan.
00:34:06 That's what I, you know, actually, I, I, I don't think this is like a
00:34:09 secret or anything, but I know, remember that guy at the Hunter Hunter,
00:34:12 2011 Dick writing association guy?
00:34:14 Yeah.
00:34:15 That guy is like the biggest lefty meme dude in the world.
00:34:19 That person is, is I think one of the people working on the shonen run.
00:34:22 It's like a team of people or something.
00:34:24 So there, so there's a little bit of info for you.
00:34:26 And by the way, I commented on their video.
00:34:29 Like the, the second one sounded particularly aggressive and mean towards
00:34:33 me and I just, in a cordial way, just posted like, Hey guys, just so you
00:34:36 know, I'm not, I'm not actually like an anarcho capitalist.
00:34:38 I don't believe in these things, but you know, it's okay.
00:34:40 We have different interpretations and I wish you well.
00:34:42 Good luck everybody.
00:34:43 And, uh, we just proceeded to have a very cordial discussion about, uh, this.
00:34:47 So we're on good terms.
00:34:49 Me and the shonen Ronan, uh, as a collective shout out to Hunter Hunter Dick
00:34:53 writing association and sort out online dick writing is Dick writing
00:34:56 association, both very long time commenters who have been.
00:34:59 One, a pure capitalist, one, a pure communist.
00:35:02 So there could be no peace between the two.
00:35:06 Well, now what?
00:35:08 I'm, I'm going to be fucking like Onyx Pilled.
00:35:11 I need, I need to invent a new pill for me, for my people.
00:35:16 Fucking pill, you know what?
00:35:17 Cause you know, people call themselves black pilled, but they're not really black
00:35:21 pilled. They care too much.
00:35:22 They're too mad about stuff.
00:35:24 If you were truly.
00:35:25 Oh, you have to be, uh, you have to take the iron pill.
00:35:27 You ever read those iron pill comics?
00:35:29 I feel like I've seen the images, but I don't, I don't have them all memorized.
00:35:33 That's a pretty funny, uh, comic series called take the iron pill about a guy who
00:35:38 is like transcended above all the other pill guys.
00:35:41 That sounds cool.
00:35:42 I want, I want a little bit of that weightlifter.
00:35:43 I want a little bit of the iron pill.
00:35:46 It sounds like it's not, you know, those comics about like all the different
00:35:50 countries, like talking to each other, Poland ball.
00:35:53 That is exactly what it's like.
00:35:55 It is exactly like that.
00:35:57 Poland ball is one of them.
00:35:58 Yeah.
00:35:58 But with pills, I want to go to the pharmacist and I just want to be like,
00:36:02 Hey man, give me like a, give me two iron pills, one black pill, half a red pill.
00:36:08 And, uh, and also some Onyx pills, which haven't been invented yet, but get on it.
00:36:12 Uh, and then I'll have the perfect brain.
00:36:15 I want to, I want to go to a pharmacy and request moods or feelings specifically
00:36:19 and just say like, Hey, I'm looking for like, you know, two thirds happiness,
00:36:23 uh, one, one contentedness, three fourths, you know, rage, it's like,
00:36:27 it's like, it's like a replicator from Star Trek, except you stick your head in
00:36:31 it and it zaps you with radiation to make you feel what you need.
00:36:35 That sounds great.
00:36:36 This, this should, I mean, this should be possible, right?
00:36:39 Like with current technology, like, I mean, we have uppers and downers at the
00:36:43 very, at the very, you know, outset.
00:36:45 Yeah, we've got 60s drugs and 70s drugs and 80s drugs and they all do
00:36:49 different shit.
00:36:51 This is how, you know, when we've reached crypto punk is when we can do this,
00:36:54 like easily over the counter.
00:36:56 That's definitely a crypto punk kind of thing.
00:36:59 I want to be a big drugs head.
00:37:04 Yeah, uh, same, same.
00:37:06 You know, I don't know if it's, if it's just me being, uh, when I was young,
00:37:10 I was legitimately scared of alcohol because it made my dad at goofy and weird.
00:37:14 And I didn't understand what was going on and so I was like spooked by it.
00:37:18 Um, and then later on when I became an adult, I got more, more at peace with it.
00:37:22 And I did my drinking for a while and now, now I'm back in a place where I'm
00:37:25 like drinking is fine on occasion.
00:37:26 It could be a loosening experience, but I just don't really need it like day to
00:37:29 day, but like, I kind of like, I just don't like the idea of like taking
00:37:34 chemicals to change me.
00:37:35 But then I think, well, am I, am I so perfect right now?
00:37:39 Maybe drugs would improve this whole scheme I've got going on in here.
00:37:42 I mean, why is my natural state necessarily the ideal or best one?
00:37:46 I think about that a lot.
00:37:47 And I always feel like, uh, anything that I accomplished with the use of substances
00:37:51 is cheating, but that's saying that anyone who's like depressed or
00:37:56 takes antidepressants is cheating.
00:37:58 Your whole brain is just made of chemicals.
00:38:00 I unironically believe that using antidepressants is cheating.
00:38:04 Well, you know what?
00:38:04 You know what?
00:38:05 And it's not the right way to think.
00:38:06 It just is how I think.
00:38:07 I know what you mean.
00:38:09 I don't understand.
00:38:10 Aren't you fucking like all about transhumanism?
00:38:12 Like how can you reconcile these two things?
00:38:15 Because transhumanism is, uh, uh, modifying your body with like machines and stuff.
00:38:22 And it's like a conscious thing.
00:38:23 Like you're choosing to do that.
00:38:24 Whereas with, with drugs and stuff, it's altering your mind state.
00:38:28 And you can't like, you're not thinking, like, I didn't expect you
00:38:32 to make this distinction, Tom.
00:38:33 This is interesting because like in, in Ghost in the Shell and whatnot,
00:38:37 people just like install shit that makes them, first of all, they can
00:38:40 like connect to the internet with their own brain and absorb info.
00:38:43 I think the thing about like subsistence and stuff specifically that I find weird
00:38:47 is that like you're, you're changing your mind state, right?
00:38:51 And you're, you're no longer like the thought processes of like the things
00:38:55 that you're thinking and doing, they're not entirely 100% rooted in yourself.
00:39:00 No, your mental state at any given time is your mental state at any
00:39:04 given time is just an output of like your chemical makeup.
00:39:08 Well, not change the way you think at all.
00:39:10 Like it's not like that.
00:39:12 I, I mean, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just changing your
00:39:17 perception of the way you think.
00:39:19 It's just changing like, sure.
00:39:20 Okay.
00:39:21 For instance, when I dropped acid, basically it was, it was not
00:39:26 difficult to understand what was happening, which is simply that on average,
00:39:31 you intake a ridiculous amount of sensory data, like you're constantly
00:39:36 intaking gallons and gallons of it and your brain is sorting it all out and
00:39:39 ignoring the vast majority of it.
00:39:41 The only difference when you're on acid is that it does not
00:39:45 sort those things the same way.
00:39:47 Like you don't make the same distinctions between like what is valuable
00:39:53 data and what isn't.
00:39:54 So like if you're staring at a picture or something, your brain is so
00:39:58 overwhelmed by the amount of data it's taking in that the picture starts
00:40:01 moving because it can't quite fixate on it.
00:40:04 You know, it's just getting too much information, you know?
00:40:07 So it's not that your brain is thinking different necessarily, it's just
00:40:12 that, you know, it's not fixating on the same thing it would, it would
00:40:16 always fix on, you know?
00:40:17 I don't think that you interpret what's happening that differently.
00:40:21 Like, you know, I don't think that like the way I act or the things I say or
00:40:26 think about when I'm high are any different from the stuff I would say
00:40:29 or think about when I'm not, it's just that I'm more concentrated on it.
00:40:33 You know, it's just like, I want to be thinking because it's fun.
00:40:37 Cause I'm, you know, really in my head and I'm thinking faster or like it's
00:40:41 like time dilates a little bit, you know, like the flow of time doesn't feel the
00:40:45 same.
00:40:45 So you might be sitting there for 10 minutes and have thoughts that feel
00:40:49 like they've lasted an hour, you know, because you're just thinking faster than
00:40:53 you normally would be.
00:40:54 But like, again, it's not different thoughts.
00:40:58 It's not like you're a different person.
00:40:59 So to me, it just feels like, I mean, basically just modification.
00:41:03 Like I made a video called metahumanism began way back when I first got really
00:41:07 into weed where I was talking about how like, you know, different strains of weed
00:41:11 literally have different effects and you can figure out what they are.
00:41:14 And like, if you want to calm yourself down, like you can consistently take
00:41:19 indica and just, you know what mind state is going to put you in.
00:41:24 So it's not like it's just taking agency away from you.
00:41:28 I think people feel robbed of agency when they do drugs or drink alcohol because
00:41:32 they don't understand what's happening.
00:41:33 Like they don't know why it's changing them.
00:41:36 They don't understand the mechanism of it.
00:41:38 They don't know exactly what the changes are.
00:41:40 Once you know the changes, they're consistent.
00:41:42 It's always the same thing.
00:41:43 I can drink and I always know how I'm going to act.
00:41:46 I always know exactly what's going to happen because I've just observed the way
00:41:51 I act when I get like different stages of drunk.
00:41:53 You know, if I if I smoke an indica, I'm going to lay on the couch.
00:41:56 I'm going to do nothing but watch anime and eat everything in the house.
00:41:59 If I take a sativa, I'm going to have, I'm going to start dropping black pills
00:42:03 like bombs on Yokohama.
00:42:05 I'm going to fucking have a billion thoughts in my head and I'm going to
00:42:08 want to write something, you know, and it's like, that's consistent.
00:42:11 I can track it.
00:42:13 That's why I think drugs are cool.
00:42:15 Well, okay, you know, that's all perfectly reasonable.
00:42:17 And I fully admit, I don't have a vast experience with drugs.
00:42:20 I did a bunch of drinking and I did some weed in college fairly regularly.
00:42:24 And like my only experiences have been across the board are simply that,
00:42:28 like I've just lost the rest of the day.
00:42:30 It might be really fun, but I can't do any work.
00:42:33 And so, like for me, most of my day or whenever I'm like, should I just
00:42:37 like get drunk this afternoon, which occasionally crossed my mind.
00:42:40 It's like, well, no, because I've got things to do.
00:42:43 So that would just interrupt that process.
00:42:45 Where do I get that new drug?
00:42:47 What's it called?
00:42:47 Happiness.
00:42:49 Who's working on that one?
00:42:51 I don't know.
00:42:51 Yeah, hasn't been released yet.
00:42:52 The trailers look sick.
00:42:54 I've been, I've been searching for it in every comment section on YouTube,
00:42:57 but I haven't found it yet.
00:42:58 You might not be that into weed or alcohol, but have you ever considered
00:43:02 just like taking Adderall or something?
00:43:05 Considered, sure.
00:43:06 Because it is, it's like the few times I've done that.
00:43:10 Adderall is unironically the only good drug.
00:43:13 Adderall is, I mean, again, it has all these drugs have different
00:43:16 effects on different people.
00:43:17 So, you know, consult your pharmacist before use.
00:43:21 I'll be your pharmacist.
00:43:24 No, don't actually ask me about drugs.
00:43:26 Just listen to my podcasts about them.
00:43:29 Um, Adderall makes, for me anyway, it, it makes me feel like really charged up.
00:43:36 My skin starts tingling and I'm like, I have to sweat.
00:43:40 Like I have to do something to sweat or else I'm going to catch on fire.
00:43:43 So I'm going to clean the entire house.
00:43:45 Like every time I've done Adderall, it's just like, bam, house gets cleaned.
00:43:49 Everything gets organized.
00:43:50 Everything gets put away, ready for work.
00:43:52 Like super focused.
00:43:55 Did you, I'm with you.
00:43:56 This is perfectly reasonable.
00:43:57 And I'm sure it could definitely have these effects, but when, when
00:43:59 these types of things come up, I feel similarly to what Tom was saying before.
00:44:03 And it's that, okay, let's say that like I'm able to be very productive
00:44:07 with Adderall or whatever.
00:44:09 And maybe I can even afford it, but like there could come a time
00:44:11 where I don't have that Adderall.
00:44:13 And what I worry about is that this artificial boost to my productivity
00:44:16 or whatever falls away.
00:44:18 And then I'm now at a reduced state of my natural.
00:44:21 Think of it like you're playing Mario Kart and you got to get those mushrooms.
00:44:25 So you can go a little faster, you know.
00:44:28 The mushroom is a one time use item.
00:44:30 You just, you hit the mushroom and you go a little faster.
00:44:32 But did you, but did you, when I play RPGs, I'm the kind of guy, when I play
00:44:36 a JRPG, you have those single item use, like stat boosting items that you know
00:44:40 are really good, but you save them for the entire game.
00:44:43 Because you never know when you're going to actually quote unquote need them.
00:44:47 And you end up being the final boss without ever using them once in the game.
00:44:50 I did that too.
00:44:50 And like in a lot of games, there's trade offs where like, you know, in Pokemon,
00:44:53 if you use a rare candy, doesn't give you the same stat boost, right?
00:44:57 Like it, right?
00:44:58 Like I've used an EV stone kit.
00:44:59 So it's like, you know, that's, that's like, there are some, you know,
00:45:03 performance enhancing drugs that have drawbacks.
00:45:06 You're not really building the muscles in the natural way or whatever.
00:45:09 It's not, you know, not building everything up correctly.
00:45:12 But like I said, I think of it less as like, it's not a permanent upgrade, you know,
00:45:16 it's like hitting, again, it's like hitting a mushroom.
00:45:18 And I don't know why I keep saying hitting a mushroom because you would normally
00:45:21 use a mushroom in a, you know what I mean?
00:45:23 Oh, wait, in Mario Kart.
00:45:25 Oh, no, in the in the minecart ride in Super Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars,
00:45:30 you do in fact hit the mushroom and gives you a speed boost as opposed to, you know,
00:45:35 you know, it's weird.
00:45:36 I've never like been dependent on any substance.
00:45:40 I've never like become addicted to something.
00:45:42 Like I, I get really drunk three times a year and I'm good.
00:45:47 And like, I get, I like, I'll take like an Adderall when I can find one,
00:45:51 which is almost never because nothing is available.
00:45:55 That's probably the trick.
00:45:56 I just know that I've been vaping THC all the time to help help the pain of being a broken boy.
00:46:06 And I have drunk before a bunch of times.
00:46:09 And every time that happens, my mind just escapes me.
00:46:13 And I hate the feeling intensely because I'll start having thoughts that I can't control.
00:46:18 They come like 10 million miles a minute and it's really annoying.
00:46:22 I hate it and it's a terrible feeling.
00:46:24 You got to, you got to manage it.
00:46:25 It's like everything happens in, in a gradation, you know, like if you want to get high,
00:46:31 if you just take like one hit, then you can measure the results of that,
00:46:36 take another hit, measure the results of that, you know, and like chart, like, okay, here's this,
00:46:41 this is how high I get off of three hits and like how, what is the effect of that?
00:46:45 You know, like with beers, we talked about this extensively way back in the day
00:46:50 that the Dick Masterson three beers rule that like if you drink exactly three beers,
00:46:55 it gets you just in the right mood to be like upbeat and talkative and having a good time
00:47:00 and like feeling the vibe of the room.
00:47:02 But as soon as you hit the fourth beer, that's when it's like you start acting like a fucking idiot.
00:47:07 You know, so it's like, you just got to stay at that, that three beers level.
00:47:11 I don't have that. I don't have that because I've, I've tried the three beer rule before
00:47:16 a few times and usually you're a lightweight than three beers is probably too much.
00:47:19 I mean, even like one, one beer, I can do one beer, okay.
00:47:22 But like as soon as I hit two, like when I don't, I don't have that midpoint.
00:47:27 I literally just shut down whenever I'm inebriated in any sort of way and I'll just
00:47:31 stare at the floor and my brain will be freaking out and that's just what happens and I hate it.
00:47:36 Oh wait, modern haiku, everything happens in a gradation across this gay nation.
00:47:44 Right? There we go.
00:47:45 I don't know if that's a haiku, but it's close enough.
00:47:48 It's a western haiku.
00:47:49 In a gradation across this great nation.
00:47:53 I said gay nation, god damn it.
00:47:55 This gay nation, dude.
00:47:58 Can't give America too much credit.
00:47:59 You can add some more syllables. I don't know, whatever.
00:48:02 Is it jumping off point, clearly?
00:48:04 Yeah, I think another reason why I feel I am okay with transhumanism and not with drugs
00:48:11 so much with the mental state thing, just because I was raised on shonen anime where
00:48:14 it's all about pure willpower.
00:48:16 I feel that, I feel that in a big way.
00:48:19 Though, you know, if you think about it, okay, it's true that yeah,
00:48:23 everyone wants to like do it through their force of effort, like fucking Vegeta and just
00:48:27 man up and like be powerful, but the reality of the world is some people are like literally
00:48:33 born with more juice of focus or whatever than other people.
00:48:37 That's literally unfair.
00:48:39 I mean, that's the entire point of Dragon Ball Z.
00:48:42 Yeah, I mean Saiyans are just better than humans who are better than...
00:48:45 Vegeta is just constantly cucked by Goku's talent.
00:48:48 That's true. And you know, there's that whole monologue, that legendary monologue at the end
00:48:53 of the Buu Saga where Vegeta questions why it is that Kakarot has
00:48:57 consistently done better than him.
00:48:59 And his conclusion is that I think it's that he has mercy like while fighting.
00:49:03 Like it's for him, it's not about power, it's about the love of the battle or something.
00:49:07 I don't know.
00:49:08 Makes sense in a way, because if you want to be able to defeat your opponent without
00:49:12 killing them, you have to be overwhelmingly stronger than them,
00:49:14 as opposed to just a little bit stronger than them.
00:49:16 Maybe that's what he meant.
00:49:17 He did kill Vegeta, didn't he?
00:49:19 I mean, Frieza.
00:49:21 Or did he just leave Frieza?
00:49:22 He does kill his enemies.
00:49:24 Goku didn't want to kill Frieza.
00:49:26 He let him live like three times.
00:49:28 Is that only in the English version?
00:49:30 Because I know he's very different in Japanese.
00:49:32 Yeah, in the Japanese version, he's just an idiot.
00:49:34 In the English version, like for example, with the first Vegeta fight,
00:49:39 he let Vegeta go and he said, oh, Krillin, I believe he can be good one day.
00:49:43 But in the Japanese version, it's totally different.
00:49:46 He said he lets Vegeta go specifically so that Vegeta can get stronger and fight him again.
00:49:52 Like it's very selfish.
00:49:52 Right, Goku is like a real sociopath.
00:49:54 Yeah, Goku is the same.
00:49:55 And in the sub.
00:49:58 Not a cool character at all.
00:50:00 What a fucking badass.
00:50:02 But that's it.
00:50:02 Maybe it's his like, even Vegeta becomes more of a moral fag than Goku.
00:50:06 Yeah, Vegeta is like the way better guy by the end of the fucking series.
00:50:11 Yeah, especially by the end of the series.
00:50:12 Dude, the fucking sickest part of the whole dub is like in the boo arc,
00:50:15 when he's like fucking broken and battered on the ground.
00:50:18 Hell yeah.
00:50:19 Boo kicked his ass and Goku's up there fighting him.
00:50:21 And he's like, you're the better one, Kakarot.
00:50:23 You're the better one.
00:50:24 He finally just accepts it that there's just this gap that can't be closed.
00:50:28 It's such a cathartic moment.
00:50:29 And by the time everything this man was about has just been closed in a negative way.
00:50:35 But he's found his family his other way to give himself meaning,
00:50:39 despite this long standing goal never being able to be.
00:50:42 Oh, it's so fucking good.
00:50:43 It's good shit.
00:50:44 And in Super, he's like a total family man.
00:50:46 He's like cranking out babies.
00:50:48 He's like, yeah, he's just like a good boy.
00:50:50 And he's like, and Goku's like, we gotta go train.
00:50:53 He's like, I can't.
00:50:53 My wife's pregnant.
00:50:54 You retard.
00:50:55 He actually tells his wife how long he'll be out training,
00:50:58 as opposed to Goku, who just instant transmissions the fuck out of there.
00:51:05 You know, it's funny that you brought up that you like grew up with Shonen stuff
00:51:08 that was all about concentrated power of will.
00:51:10 I grew up with nothing but drug music.
00:51:12 So maybe that's why.
00:51:14 I sure these things in form are.
00:51:16 Yeah, like I'm thinking about like the most like foundational stuff to my
00:51:19 personality is like listening to the Mars Volta where like in their interviews,
00:51:22 they're like, yeah, we've done every drug there ever has been, you know,
00:51:25 like just like listening to all the drugs they did on that.
00:51:27 I grew up with wrestling.
00:51:28 And that's why nothing that's real matters to me.
00:51:31 And I just want everything to be as insane and colorful and ridiculous as possible at all times.
00:51:39 You know, that's why I'm that's why I'm a crypto punk anarcho fascist fucking gay boy.
00:51:50 What else is going on team?
00:51:51 I'm tapped.
00:51:52 I learned I learned all about Twitter yesterday.
00:51:55 I learned I've been using Twitter completely wrong.
00:51:57 Yeah, how so?
00:51:59 Because I made I made a tweet yesterday because yesterday it was D23.
00:52:04 Wait, let me guess.
00:52:05 You you complained about the Twitter in some way and somebody immediately was there with
00:52:10 the tweet deck link, right?
00:52:12 No, no, this is this is like so what the story is is that yesterday was D23,
00:52:18 which is like Disney's big like, oh, we're announcing that we own half the world again
00:52:22 sort of thing.
00:52:23 Right.
00:52:23 And I don't know if you've seen Disney's new logo.
00:52:26 Have you seen Disney's new logo?
00:52:27 Oh, I saw your tweet.
00:52:28 The Disney plus logo where it's just Disney plus Pixar plus Marvel plus Star Wars plus
00:52:33 National Geographic.
00:52:34 They're like whipping their dick around.
00:52:35 They're like, yeah, we own half the world.
00:52:37 So I just I just screen capped it and like official logo from the end of the trading the
00:52:41 tramp trailer.
00:52:41 Everyone else find this low key dystopian.
00:52:43 That's a lot of plus just like haha.
00:52:45 Yeah, Disney's getting pretty weird.
00:52:47 And so someone quote tweets me some random person.
00:52:49 I don't know.
00:52:50 And they're like, ah, the quintessential.
00:52:53 I don't consume any media outside of a few major entertainment companies.
00:52:56 And now I'm scared because Disney, the company that I worshipped, now bought them and I'm
00:53:01 somehow surprised.
00:53:02 That's a lot to infer.
00:53:04 Yeah.
00:53:04 And so I just like yeah.
00:53:06 So I responded to them and I was just like, if you think I'm like a Disney show, you got
00:53:11 the totally wrong idea.
00:53:12 Just like casually dismissing it and then they they responded to me again.
00:53:16 They're like Twitter pro tip.
00:53:17 If someone quote tweets you, they're not referring to what you're saying.
00:53:21 And I'm like, what?
00:53:22 What are you fucking talking about?
00:53:25 And so was there OK?
00:53:26 Sorry.
00:53:27 Go on.
00:53:27 And I'm just like, what?
00:53:29 And like everyone just started dog piling on this guy because it was the most retarded
00:53:33 thing of all time.
00:53:34 OK, well, that's good.
00:53:35 Go on.
00:53:35 I hope he died.
00:53:35 I hope he died.
00:53:37 Yeah.
00:53:37 He's like Twitter pro tip.
00:53:38 When someone quote tweets you instead of commenting, it's probably not about you.
00:53:42 And then I respond and said, then why are you quoting if you're not referring to the
00:53:46 quoted tweet?
00:53:46 Yeah.
00:53:47 What is the point?
00:53:48 Just steal the image.
00:53:49 If you just yeah.
00:53:50 And then they just got really fucking mad.
00:53:51 They're like, oh, you're getting so fucking bent out of shape about it.
00:53:54 I'll delete it.
00:53:55 But I'm just like, I just think it's funny.
00:53:57 And I'm just like, oh, I guess quote tweets aren't for quoting a tweet.
00:54:00 I've learned something new today.
00:54:03 So you did not actually learn anything.
00:54:04 This was an ironic.
00:54:06 It was an ironic message.
00:54:08 I learned learning.
00:54:09 Yeah, it was some crypto learning.
00:54:12 We're all on the same page as, you know, as Jesse discovered at the start of this podcast,
00:54:17 not everyone in our audience knows what the fuck we're talking about when we are sarcastic.
00:54:21 But true, true.
00:54:22 Yeah, we need we need some sarcasm tags.
00:54:25 Oh, yeah, we do.
00:54:26 Bro, we just need to put a slash s at the end of every title of every episode.
00:54:30 Oh, God.
00:54:31 Yeah.
00:54:32 Thank you.
00:54:32 That save us.
00:54:33 Is that a thing slash s for sarcasm?
00:54:35 Yeah, I've never seen that before.
00:54:38 How how thank God, you know, speaking of things.
00:54:41 I say that are probably sarcastic, but I've not got to think about it.
00:54:45 Uh, you know, I don't care if Disney takes over the world.
00:54:48 But if I see one more live action trailer for an old fucking Disney movie, I'm just
00:54:52 Lady in the Tramp.
00:54:53 Oh, yeah, I saw it.
00:54:54 I saw it.
00:54:55 Oh, lady.
00:54:57 And the only thing people remember about Lady in the Tramp is the spaghetti sauce scene.
00:55:02 That's the only thing that I remember.
00:55:05 I remember that at the end they have babies and all the boy babies look like the dad and
00:55:09 all the girl babies look like the mom.
00:55:11 Reinforcing gender stereotypes.
00:55:13 It's beautiful.
00:55:15 I just know how it should be.
00:55:16 I just know the part where like Lady gets all like butt flustered and mad at the tramp
00:55:20 because he's got too many other ladies.
00:55:22 And it's like, bitch, you can't fucking hold this dude down.
00:55:28 Damn.
00:55:29 That sounds like a MGTOW anthem, dude.
00:55:30 I got to get in on this.
00:55:31 My fucking Lady in the Tramp, the original MGTOW movie, the original red pill.
00:55:37 The fucking theater reel in my brain just unspun for a second because you guys were talking
00:55:42 about this and I'm picturing 101 Dalmatians because that's also getting a live action.
00:55:47 Emma Stone.
00:55:48 Oh, Cinderella, yep.
00:55:49 That one already had a live action remake.
00:55:49 Wait, they're making it again?
00:55:51 Yeah, they're doing it again.
00:55:51 What the fuck?
00:55:52 What the fuck?
00:55:53 Wait a minute.
00:55:54 Holy shit.
00:55:55 I totally forgot about that.
00:55:56 They're literally remaking the live action remake.
00:56:00 Okay, but this one's going to be like Tim Burton Direct, you know?
00:56:06 It's going to be like Edward Scissor, like what's that one about the Barbershop,
00:56:10 Sweeney Todd style.
00:56:11 Is that true?
00:56:12 Is Tim Burton directing it?
00:56:13 I don't think so.
00:56:14 It just has that kind of attitude.
00:56:16 All these live action movies feel like a Tim Burton nightmare because they're just all so uncanny.
00:56:21 Hot take.
00:56:21 Tim Burton is a shitty director.
00:56:23 No, it's not true.
00:56:25 I like some of his work.
00:56:28 I like Batman Returns.
00:56:31 I unharmonically love Sweeney Todd.
00:56:33 I think Sweeney Todd's a fucking modern masterpiece.
00:56:36 And Big Fish.
00:56:37 Shut up, did you?
00:56:37 Get out of here.
00:56:38 He's cool.
00:56:41 I like Sweeney Todd, but I don't think that anything good about it is attributable to Tim Burton.
00:56:47 Okay, I will say that the character design of Todd himself is the most over-the-top,
00:56:53 ridiculous style of character.
00:56:56 That's honestly my biggest criticism.
00:56:57 That Sweeney Todd himself, he looks like such a caricature of this character
00:57:02 that there was no way other than him becoming a murderer from the moment he adopted this hairstyle.
00:57:06 It had to be done.
00:57:08 So that's a little on the nose.
00:57:10 Other than that.
00:57:11 That just seems like his style, Tim Burton.
00:57:13 Yeah, why couldn't he barber himself better if he was such a great fucking dare?
00:57:17 That was his pathos.
00:57:18 He could cut anyone else's hair except his own.
00:57:23 That should have been the main story of the thing.
00:57:26 Oh, just trapped.
00:57:27 Trapped on that prison island, Australia or whatever,
00:57:29 as before he could get back with his shaving tools.
00:57:31 But alas, he just can't quaff his own quaff.
00:57:34 They have to make the Avengers so that Sweeney Todd and Edward Scissorhands can finally barber each other.
00:57:41 Yeah, exactly.
00:57:42 And solve all their problems.
00:57:44 Speaking of movies and world and things,
00:57:47 okay, can anyone break down for me what the deal is with this whole Spider-Man leaving the MCU thing?
00:57:51 Because I don't understand what's going on in if I should care.
00:57:54 Well, back before...
00:57:55 You shouldn't. I can help you with that.
00:57:57 Before Marvel was successful in the late 90s when they were kind of struggling a bit,
00:58:03 they sold off a bunch of their properties to other movie studios for cheap,
00:58:07 like Blade and the X-Men and Spider-Man went to Sony.
00:58:10 So now they're successful, but those other companies still own the shit.
00:58:15 And so Sony is...
00:58:16 So Spider-Man was leased out to Marvel for the MCU scene.
00:58:20 Yeah, Sony bought the film rights to use Spider-Man.
00:58:22 Right now, Sony has all the cards and they're like,
00:58:24 fuck you, Disney, fuck you, Marvel.
00:58:26 You gotta pay us trillions of fucking dollars if you want Spider-Man back.
00:58:30 Correct me if I'm wrong.
00:58:31 I heard that like Disney...
00:58:32 I don't know.
00:58:33 There's no bad guy, good guy.
00:58:34 And these kind of like corporate decisions or anything.
00:58:35 But I heard that like Disney was like asking for unreasonable terms.
00:58:39 They wanted 50% of everything from the Spider-Man movies.
00:58:42 And Sony's the one footing the bills for everything.
00:58:44 That seems like a lot.
00:58:45 Yeah.
00:58:46 So I would be in favor of Marvel itself owning all of Marvel's shit.
00:58:51 That just goes without saying.
00:58:52 But because Marvel is also Disney, it becomes gray.
00:58:56 And gray and gay.
00:58:59 Yeah, exactly.
00:59:00 Okay, fair enough.
00:59:01 So I guess it's just done.
00:59:02 Well, that's the whole thing is like they're saying that there's still two more Tom Holland
00:59:06 movies that they're going to make, but they're not going to be referring to the MCU anymore
00:59:10 because they legally can't at this point.
00:59:12 Which kind of fucks up the end of Homecoming since it was all...
00:59:16 The last movie was tied into the MCU like entirely.
00:59:19 So like, what are they going to do?
00:59:21 How odd.
00:59:21 It's very strange.
00:59:22 Yeah.
00:59:23 And people are like, they're just going to reboot Spider-Man again.
00:59:25 They did.
00:59:26 They're going to bring Sam Raimi back.
00:59:28 What the fuck were they doing?
00:59:29 They were like, Sony offered to let Tom Holland play the character at least one more time in like a Sony movie.
00:59:36 And the last Zoomer Spider-Man movie did end sort of setting things up where like it could be
00:59:43 like a self-contained next Spider-Man movie without any MCU stuff if they wanted.
00:59:47 They could certainly write it.
00:59:48 Because it ends with Spider-Man getting framed and everybody turning on him and the whole world
00:59:53 hates Spider-Man.
00:59:54 So it's kind of going back to the typical status quo of what Spider-Man has always been
00:59:58 as opposed to this weird Zoomer Tony Stark Jr. Spider-Man that they've been agreeing with.
01:00:03 The stage is set for them to do something cool.
01:00:05 And I hope they do because I'm not a huge fan of many Iron Man being Spider-Man.
01:00:09 Spider-Man's supposed to be this guy who's just like the world endlessly shits on him
01:00:14 and he just goes out at night and spandex and tries to clear his head.
01:00:17 He's just like a working class dude who's got a deal with shit.
01:00:21 All right, yeah.
01:00:22 Not some bourgeois corporate elite Iron Man suit wearing, you know, motherfucker.
01:00:27 Yeah, the Zoomer Spider-Man is a class traitor is what he is.
01:00:32 It's so true.
01:00:34 I remember those, I mean I was never, I never read any comics growing up like pretty much
01:00:38 at all but I fucking love those Spider-Man shows back in the day.
01:00:41 Remember that one where he went to like weird negaverse and he had like a watch
01:00:45 that was filled with like bugs that would automatically build his head.
01:00:48 That was fucking insane.
01:00:49 That was Fox's answer to Batman Beyond and it was.
01:00:52 It was so sick and there was like a sexy girl bat or something that he made out
01:00:56 with that one time and he got sexy pictures of Spider-Man kissing
01:00:59 that girl villain or something or maybe-
01:01:01 Interesting that you remember that scene specifically.
01:01:04 That's, it came to my first baby boner and I'll never forget.
01:01:11 Good times.
01:01:12 We need more of that shit.
01:01:13 I know I said this before but like I just happened upon watching like one episode
01:01:17 of like the classic 90s X-Men and it just-
01:01:20 Hell yeah.
01:01:21 Soul.
01:01:22 Soul out the ass.
01:01:23 There was so much soul in every fucking cream.
01:01:25 That show holds up like a motherfucker.
01:01:28 It's so good.
01:01:28 It does.
01:01:29 I just recommend.
01:01:29 Morph, this one's for you, Morph.
01:01:31 Yeah.
01:01:32 Yeah, fuck yeah.
01:01:33 Man, I remember, I remember seeing the like first two episodes.
01:01:39 I think maybe we had them on VHS or something.
01:01:40 Yeah, I think we did.
01:01:41 The first two episodes of the old X-Men cartoon.
01:01:44 Remember Jubilee fucking up that handsome arcade owner's property because she's an asshole?
01:01:49 And then I never saw any more of it and I was like, what happens?
01:01:54 So much of that show.
01:01:54 There's like a whole universe here and I don't know any of it.
01:01:56 Did these X-Men ever become the Y-Men let alone the Z-Men they were destined to be?
01:02:00 The characters are so pitch perfect in that show.
01:02:02 Like just in the very first episode when you first see Gambit
01:02:06 and he's in a store and he's buying a pack of playing cards
01:02:10 and the lady behind the counter is like, oh, you like to play cards?
01:02:13 And he just goes, I like Solitaire, okay?
01:02:17 Unless I got someone to play with.
01:02:20 And it's just like, that's Gambit.
01:02:21 That's all of Gambit right there in that one line of dialogue.
01:02:25 I gave him so much.
01:02:25 Was that?
01:02:28 Oh my god.
01:02:29 Was that?
01:02:31 Remember that?
01:02:32 It's much easier.
01:02:33 Hearing Lunchie say that made me instantly sad that I know that Joke is older than he is.
01:02:39 Listen, I used to load up YouTube.
01:02:42 I used to open up fucking Bud Light commercial or whatever the hell it was.
01:02:46 Song of the Hedgehog and Doom and Duke Nukem and all those sorts of people.
01:02:50 And they would all say, was that?
01:02:52 I would feel like nothing much, bro.
01:02:56 Dude, I am in fucking bliss right now.
01:02:58 I've lived from piss to bliss right now.
01:03:02 And I woke up earlier today and the piece of fuel is going to happen in like five minutes.
01:03:05 I was like, oh man, well, yeah, I would like to record the piece of fuel, but I got a shower.
01:03:08 I'm in a good fucking routine.
01:03:10 I'm on top of the world right now, guys.
01:03:12 And so I took a shower and now I'm here to record the PCP.
01:03:16 I don't care if I'm going to get a big penalty.
01:03:18 I don't care about anything.
01:03:19 I don't care about money.
01:03:19 Don't pay me anything.
01:03:20 I just want to record with the piece.
01:03:21 Yeah, was that?
01:03:23 Was that?
01:03:25 Fuck yeah.
01:03:27 Munchie, what's your current life status?
01:03:29 Are you in school yet?
01:03:30 Are you?
01:03:30 Where are you right now?
01:03:31 What's going on?
01:03:31 Blitzed to hell and back.
01:03:33 Baked, if you will, like banana bread.
01:03:36 Nice.
01:03:37 I am one week away from going to school.
01:03:39 This is my last piece of PMA record as a free man, as a free mate.
01:03:42 Incredible.
01:03:43 Incredible.
01:03:44 This is it.
01:03:44 This is my last appearance for, I don't know, a little bit.
01:03:47 Not as in I'm leaving, but as in like, oh, I can't scream really loud and wake up my roommates.
01:03:52 Fun fact right now, I'm in a room alone, by the way, right now.
01:03:54 For the past couple of months, I've been with Kazzy and she's been in the room,
01:03:57 but they're all off doing bullshit and I'm not here because of UPS.
01:04:00 I'll tell my UPS story in a little bit, but to answer your question,
01:04:03 I, my school, not there yet, but will be soon.
01:04:05 So this, this, this is my last gasps.
01:04:08 When's your, when's your move in?
01:04:09 When's your move in?
01:04:10 Uh, literally next Saturday.
01:04:12 So.
01:04:13 Incredible.
01:04:13 Yeah.
01:04:13 Incredible.
01:04:14 Literally, literally last one.
01:04:15 It, it, we're on, we're on the brink, fellas.
01:04:17 We're on the brink.
01:04:19 Oh my god.
01:04:19 So when people hear this, it'll be tomorrow.
01:04:21 Then people hear this.
01:04:22 Oh yeah, it will.
01:04:23 He moves in.
01:04:23 Oh my god.
01:04:24 Oh yeah, um, send me your ones.
01:04:26 Can we, can we get a one in chat for the future?
01:04:28 Which is, I guess, the present for you now viewer.
01:04:31 What were we talking about?
01:04:32 What's this been, what's this PCP been about?
01:04:35 What like, like level of interest are we at right now?
01:04:37 We're talking about X-Men, the animated series.
01:04:39 We were just talking about, we were talking about classic 90s cartoons.
01:04:42 We talked about, uh, buying Greenland and how it makes all the sense in the world, uh, various things of this nature.
01:04:49 Yeah.
01:04:49 It's all over the place.
01:04:50 Greenland would be a fucking sick buy, honestly.
01:04:53 Once global warming kicks in and that shits all fucking green.
01:04:56 That's what I'm talking about.
01:04:57 Yeah.
01:04:58 Yeah.
01:04:59 Literally.
01:04:59 Yeah.
01:05:00 I like, I like the forethought of our president.
01:05:02 I'm not just like, man, the climate kind of ruined the planet.
01:05:05 We could stop it or, or, we could capitalize on it.
01:05:10 You know, we could just do, we could just do what Ben Shapiro says and once global warming kicks in and all our houses flood,
01:05:16 all our houses flood, we just sell them and move.
01:05:19 Damn, he's so right.
01:05:20 You know, uh, Andrew Yang's policy on climate change interested me because he said, he was like, you know,
01:05:27 we could try to do something about it, but America only makes up for like 15% of the problem.
01:05:32 And you're not going to get all the other countries on board.
01:05:34 Yeah.
01:05:35 How are we going to get China and India, which are most of the problems to do it?
01:05:37 So his advice was, we need to move to higher ground.
01:05:41 Greenland baby, Greenland just moved to higher ground.
01:05:44 It doesn't get higher than Greenland, baby.
01:05:46 Talking, talking latitude and all right now.
01:05:49 Yeah.
01:05:50 Good thing.
01:05:50 I don't own a house.
01:05:52 Yep.
01:05:53 Owned.
01:05:55 Or rather the opposite.
01:05:56 Dude, this is great.
01:05:57 This is great.
01:05:58 All the landlords are going to get fucked.
01:06:00 That's yeah.
01:06:01 Yeah.
01:06:01 Only some of them.
01:06:02 Some of them.
01:06:03 I mean, a lot of them.
01:06:03 Only some.
01:06:04 Well, only some of them and some of them are going to profit immensely.
01:06:07 Yeah.
01:06:07 So the landlords are going to be the ones who have the money to re-locate.
01:06:10 Break out the champagne.
01:06:11 Have that concentration of wealth.
01:06:13 How's that for redistributing?
01:06:14 Yeah, yeah.
01:06:14 Moving money from some landlords to other landlords.
01:06:17 All right, never mind.
01:06:18 I just hope that when the title waves come and everyone's rushing to get to higher ground,
01:06:23 it is there's helicopters blasting higher ground by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
01:06:28 The whole time that it's happening.
01:06:30 I'm so ready for global warming and all the seas just to rise
01:06:34 because then we'll be able to do away with Democrats, Republicans, blah, blah, blah.
01:06:38 Nothing.
01:06:38 This will only be about the Obi-Wan's and the Anakin's anymore.
01:06:41 The high landers.
01:06:41 The low landers and the high landers.
01:06:42 Yeah.
01:06:42 The only two political factions that exist.
01:06:47 Oh my God.
01:06:48 People are going to meme.
01:06:49 I mean, that scene's already been mememed to hell.
01:06:50 But the high landers are going to meme the low landers so hard every day of their life.
01:06:54 They're going to be the new, you know, the new untouchables of society, basically.
01:06:58 What was that?
01:06:59 Was that cartoon with Will Ferrell as the dad where it's like there's like the hill people
01:07:03 and the valley people and the valley people and the valley people are all like mutated
01:07:08 from like from like radioactive waste.
01:07:11 That's exactly what it's going to be.
01:07:12 That's where we're going.
01:07:13 That'd be so cool.
01:07:14 Oh, I'm like, dude, I've never been more high for global warming than I am right now.
01:07:18 You guys have really sold it on me.
01:07:20 That is already what it is like.
01:07:24 Like the idea of the oblogs is that it is meant to be reality.
01:07:28 Well, I mean, there's no, I assume you mean like in terms of economic strategy.
01:07:32 Well, like because in LA in particular, the rich people live in the hills.
01:07:35 Like they all live up on the mountains and everybody down in LA is a fucking cesspool.
01:07:40 Well, it's like it's like that song.
01:07:42 It's like that that one tin soldier song is like the valley people versus the mountain people.
01:07:47 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
01:07:49 I mean, literally throughout all time, kings have been at the highest point.
01:07:52 Like they always they're at the high ground.
01:07:54 Like this is just how they have structure.
01:07:56 They have the high ground.
01:07:57 It is just the reality.
01:07:59 I want to be in the Obi-Wan this whole time.
01:08:01 Yeah, okay.
01:08:02 Complain about white people all you want.
01:08:03 But I remember when fucking Liam or whatever his name is, Obi-Wan came over and fucking beat
01:08:08 the shit out of me and no one cared.
01:08:09 No one called that racial profiling.
01:08:10 It's not right.
01:08:11 Wait, what?
01:08:12 When a racial profiling is piled by Obi-Wan Kenobi, no one bad their fucking eye.
01:08:17 This is the real system.
01:08:18 Munchy, you got to look out.
01:08:19 You and McGregor confirmed to come back as Obi-Wan for a Star Wars show.
01:08:22 No.
01:08:23 He's coming back around to beat your ass in the ground again.
01:08:27 I'm going to go to Star Wars 500, like the Indy 500, but Star Wars character running around
01:08:31 in cosplay over in a track over and over again.
01:08:33 I'm going to sit in my seat.
01:08:34 I'm going to settle down and think, oh, I sure hope I am beating up today.
01:08:37 And then Ian McGregor is going to come out with his fucking bath robes on and his BDSM gear.
01:08:42 What about the ball gag and just fly it, sling it to me.
01:08:45 And I have to put it on and dance around like, fuck you Obi-Wan.
01:08:49 The Sith really are the most persecuted minority.
01:08:52 That's so true.
01:08:53 You give them the old sheave spin, my dude.
01:08:54 I mean, they are the smallest minority.
01:08:57 It's said in Star Wars there's only ever two of them.
01:08:59 A master in apprentice is only two.
01:09:00 They're the smallest marginalized group.
01:09:02 There's not only two.
01:09:03 That can't be accurate.
01:09:04 Not only two at any given time.
01:09:06 They have enclaves.
01:09:07 That's what the prequels said.
01:09:09 That's why they're fucking weird.
01:09:10 Wait, really?
01:09:11 There's two, a master.
01:09:12 Yeah, they said there was two.
01:09:13 There's two at a time.
01:09:15 Well, it makes sense.
01:09:16 It started out, there was like a whole Sith community.
01:09:19 You see, you like go to their little town in Knights of the Old Republic.
01:09:22 But by that point, it's already destroyed.
01:09:23 Back in the old days, but now in the modern Republic times,
01:09:27 aka prequel times, there's only two.
01:09:29 Okay.
01:09:30 I know that the new movies have like uncannonized all the old books,
01:09:35 but is Knights of the Old Republic still canon?
01:09:37 I don't believe so.
01:09:37 It's the only good Star Wars thing ever made.
01:09:40 I mean, that was like way back in the distant past, right?
01:09:43 It could have been.
01:09:44 It was like a thousand, a couple thousand years before.
01:09:46 Yeah, everyone, yeah.
01:09:47 A couple thousand years.
01:09:49 By the way, guys, that game is like great and worth playing, right?
01:09:51 That's what I always hear.
01:09:52 It's a fantastic game.
01:09:53 It says it's really good.
01:09:54 It's like Mass Effect.
01:09:55 Yeah, it's like Mass Effect 1.
01:09:56 It's on par with that.
01:09:57 Okay, okay.
01:09:58 You're all saying that, but you mean story-wise.
01:10:01 Because I tried to play that game after I played the Mass Effect games,
01:10:04 and I thought it was completely incomprehensible,
01:10:07 and I had no fucking idea what was going on.
01:10:09 Well, the game is incomprehensible, did you?
01:10:10 You don't have to do anything.
01:10:11 It's just like it plays like an MMO.
01:10:13 You just walk up to shit.
01:10:15 Oh, okay.
01:10:15 Well, that sounds...
01:10:16 It's exactly like Final Fantasy XII.
01:10:21 I like Final Fantasy XII.
01:10:23 I actually like Mass Effect, probably less than Final Fantasy XII.
01:10:26 I thought the Mass Effect combat was pretty shit, like consistently.
01:10:29 Mass Effect 1 combat sucked.
01:10:31 2 and 3 was fucking good.
01:10:32 Okay, I only played one so far.
01:10:33 I gotta get back to those fucking games.
01:10:35 What am I doing with my life?
01:10:35 All right, whatever.
01:10:36 Speaking of the Sith, I remember one of the most memorable nights of my entire life
01:10:40 was I got back from watching Rogue One,
01:10:41 and I thought, I like Star Wars now, I think.
01:10:45 I said my right and left brain out of sync.
01:10:48 Doing a hearty run.
01:10:49 I mean, shake with each other.
01:10:50 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:10:51 And so I got home, and I was like,
01:10:52 okay, I'm gonna do two things right now.
01:10:54 I'm gonna binge watch a bunch of Star Wars lore,
01:10:56 and also try to cook a steak for the first time.
01:10:59 And so I basically, what ended up happening was,
01:11:04 I didn't know how to cook steak, and I didn't bother looking it up.
01:11:06 So I just like basically, I would describe it as I tried to deep fry steak,
01:11:09 aka I just like loaded like a bottle's worth of olive oil into a pan,
01:11:13 set it on high heat, and then after I was like dropped in a frozen steak into it.
01:11:17 Meanwhile, I'm watching the Emperor Try to Star-esque videos of like,
01:11:20 the entire history of the Sith Wars every year,
01:11:23 and it starts in like fucking like 315 BBY before the Battle of Yevon,
01:11:29 and it's just one big circle and dots, and there's just like one,
01:11:33 like a set of like red dots are over taking blue dots over and over again,
01:11:36 for like an hour.
01:11:37 Meanwhile, I scalded my fucking hand,
01:11:39 I'm just dropping a steak into olive oil,
01:11:40 and I'll never forget that night.
01:11:41 Fuck you, Star Wars.
01:11:43 You scalded your hand just like Anakin Skywalker scalded his entire body.
01:11:48 Is that what Obi-Wan got you, dude?
01:11:50 Yeah, it was a recap of that scene,
01:11:53 where instead of there, they're on the lava planet,
01:11:55 it's just Obi-Wan and Anakin like being really bitchy in their kitchen,
01:11:58 and then Obi-Wan drops a frozen steak into a pot of olive oil,
01:12:01 and Anakin just scalded, and he's just,
01:12:03 and then he also turns into Darth Vader.
01:12:04 Munchy yells at his steak,
01:12:06 You were the chosen one!
01:12:08 You were supposed to bring balance to my hunger and stomach!
01:12:12 This wouldn't have happened in 45 BBY!
01:12:15 Fuck you, stupid shit!
01:12:16 And then the steak yells back, I hate you!
01:12:19 Dude, okay, okay, when you were cutting that steak later,
01:12:26 it was probably like that scene where Obi-Wan cuts Darth Maul in half,
01:12:29 and he goes like,
01:12:30 Oh fuck, you're cutting me, bro, don't...
01:12:32 Actual dialogue.
01:12:35 Okay, so you know how we have the voice jail, right?
01:12:37 You know how we have like a set,
01:12:39 like a cell of villains that we have,
01:12:41 that we like absolute with like sticks and stones?
01:12:43 I propose we have a new jail for people who aren't in the voice jail,
01:12:48 but just are like general villains of the PCP.
01:12:50 I don't mean internet careers,
01:12:51 I mean like institutions.
01:12:52 A rogues gallery, perhaps?
01:12:54 Because Ben came up with the idea of hating systems, not people.
01:12:58 He invented it, as we all know on PCP.
01:13:01 Read my book.
01:13:03 I want to complain.
01:13:05 I want to have a formal complaint and submit to the real jail,
01:13:09 the entirety of UPS.
01:13:10 Not like the CEO or the higher ups,
01:13:12 like every single like service worker there,
01:13:14 everyone involved with the opera,
01:13:16 like the graphic designer made logo, they're going inside.
01:13:19 It's going to be a crap, it's going to be a fucking,
01:13:20 it's going to be like September massacres.
01:13:22 They all have to fit into one cell in the jail.
01:13:24 Yeah, so all right, I'm going to paint a picture for you,
01:13:27 because I've just been like toiling,
01:13:29 I've achieved a broken brilliance,
01:13:31 because I'm in a great move now,
01:13:32 but for the past like week,
01:13:34 I've just been in utter despair of the chain of events that have happened,
01:13:36 due to the male situation.
01:13:39 And so, like a week ago,
01:13:40 Caroline's brother is going to Montreal for college.
01:13:46 He's doing that and he's leaving this weekend.
01:13:48 The original plan is her father is going to take him to Montreal.
01:13:52 Why does this matter?
01:13:52 Well, because five days ago, he says,
01:13:54 or I'm sorry, four days ago, he's like,
01:13:56 Hey, do you want to come with us?
01:13:57 And I'm like, yes, I would love to go to Montreal.
01:13:58 How many times do you go to Montreal in your life?
01:14:00 Never, what a great opportunity.
01:14:01 It would have been amazing, incredible.
01:14:03 But I didn't bring my passport,
01:14:04 because I'm just going to,
01:14:05 originally I didn't pack a whole lot,
01:14:06 because like, you know,
01:14:07 I'm just going to go to Montreal,
01:14:09 I didn't pack a whole lot,
01:14:09 because like, you know,
01:14:10 I'm just going to Boston before I go to a fucking college.
01:14:13 I don't need a passport right now, do I?
01:14:15 Turns out I did.
01:14:16 So I'm like, okay, mom, here, here's like,
01:14:17 here's like $25.
01:14:18 Can you please ship this overnight?
01:14:19 So make sure it gets here.
01:14:21 She said yes, she does that.
01:14:23 And also, she sends my computer,
01:14:25 because I need that for an endless war thing,
01:14:27 for an endless war update ARG,
01:14:29 that I've been like really like trying,
01:14:31 like just grinding working out.
01:14:32 I have like tons of fucking like images and writing that I've created,
01:14:35 been also made of a line of flavor text,
01:14:38 and it was cool.
01:14:39 So this contributed 0.1% to this effort,
01:14:43 so I'm technically in it.
01:14:44 Yeah, and it was going to be great,
01:14:46 and I'm so looking forward to it.
01:14:47 And so there's a dilemma in my side of my mind, right?
01:14:49 Ooh, I want to release this on a weekend,
01:14:51 because that'll be the most players are active,
01:14:53 but you know, I really want to go to Montreal.
01:14:54 Okay, I want to go to Montreal.
01:14:56 Friday, two days ago, you know,
01:14:58 my passport isn't here.
01:14:59 So I unfortunately am forced to not go to Montreal,
01:15:03 because the fucking pieces of shit at UBS
01:15:05 just did not like listen to overnight.
01:15:07 They were late by two days,
01:15:09 and couldn't fucking deliver my passport for some reason.
01:15:12 And so now I'm forced to live in this fucking broken,
01:15:15 shambled shanty house with no one in it.
01:15:17 Well, well, my girlfriend and all of her family
01:15:19 and all of the fucking seven elves from hell go up to Montreal,
01:15:22 and have a gay ass fucking time without me.
01:15:24 But I think, okay, okay, silver lining,
01:15:26 there's silver lining to every story, right?
01:15:28 You know, okay, so I'm able to like work on an endless war,
01:15:30 I'm able to finish it and release it on a weekend.
01:15:32 Oh, but wait, but wait,
01:15:33 a critical part of the ARG is there's a file
01:15:37 that's only accessible on my desktop,
01:15:39 which also isn't here,
01:15:40 even though I called a total of six fucking times
01:15:44 to ensure that it was shipped to, you know,
01:15:46 the right address at the right time.
01:15:47 I called the day of it was supposed to be delivered.
01:15:49 And you know what happened?
01:15:50 You know what happened?
01:15:51 I called them, they said,
01:15:52 hey, hey, we got the right address,
01:15:53 you know, you've been calling us,
01:15:55 we're asking us that we fucked up the address,
01:15:56 and you know, we fixed it, we fixed it for you.
01:15:58 Please stop making fun of us.
01:15:59 And I say, okay, I will.
01:16:01 And then guess what?
01:16:03 I'm on my laptop, I'm on my laptop,
01:16:04 it opened up the tracking,
01:16:06 and you know, I'm watching it rigorously.
01:16:08 I'm just waiting, I'm listening for like a bat,
01:16:10 waiting for the sonic waves of the doorbell
01:16:12 to ring inside my ear or for the door to knock.
01:16:14 I guess instead of any of that,
01:16:15 I get a ding in my laptop, oh, failed delivery,
01:16:18 you didn't answer us.
01:16:19 And then like, I look outside,
01:16:21 there is no truck outside,
01:16:23 they just fucking straight up lied.
01:16:25 I like just, they didn't do what they said.
01:16:28 And so now I can't even do that.
01:16:30 I can't even fucking release in this work
01:16:32 that I've been working on.
01:16:33 So I have nothing.
01:16:34 So I'm just inside this fucking frozen tundra
01:16:36 of a cozy bedroom in Boston that I have,
01:16:39 and I'm just fucking wallowing away.
01:16:40 And I think, okay, how can I drown in my sorrows?
01:16:42 How can I drown in the pain?
01:16:44 Play Minecraft.
01:16:45 So I go to download Minecraft,
01:16:47 and Mojang wants to have my credit card.
01:16:49 So I can't even play Minecraft.
01:16:51 I can't even do that.
01:16:53 Where does the world come to?
01:16:55 That's rough, buddy.
01:16:57 It's a nightmare.
01:16:58 It's a literal nightmare.
01:16:59 And so like last night,
01:17:01 I was just pacing around like UPS, ARG, Minecraft,
01:17:05 just pacing back and forth,
01:17:06 running across my room over and over,
01:17:08 just seething up in fucking pain.
01:17:10 And I just like, something about my brain
01:17:12 just like broke that day.
01:17:13 Something about my brain,
01:17:14 just like a little bit of it chipped off.
01:17:15 And now I've just been in like a great mood
01:17:17 and I recorded like a weird like pseudo podcast last night,
01:17:21 but I'm not gonna record,
01:17:22 I'm not gonna post because I only record it,
01:17:24 so it wouldn't appear weird to my brain
01:17:26 that I was talking out loud.
01:17:27 It was great.
01:17:29 It's, I'm great now.
01:17:30 Everything's good.
01:17:31 You know, my life's ruined.
01:17:32 I'm not able to release any of the things I wanted to.
01:17:34 I'm also not able to have fun in Montreal.
01:17:36 So like everything's gone wrong
01:17:37 and I want to kill myself.
01:17:39 And that's, and that's where I am right now.
01:17:40 I hate the UPS.
01:17:41 They've done this to me.
01:17:42 They didn't allow me to go to Montreal.
01:17:43 They didn't allow me to release this ARG.
01:17:45 So I don't have to release in a weekend.
01:17:47 No one's gonna play it.
01:17:47 No one's gonna like it.
01:17:48 No, I've done nothing.
01:17:50 Nothing I've ever done will amount to anything.
01:17:51 This is the end, guys.
01:17:52 This is the insta-times for Munchie.
01:17:55 I think, I think it's time to go into war.
01:17:56 This week, and by next week,
01:17:59 interest is just gonna be gone.
01:18:00 It will.
01:18:01 If the moment will have passed.
01:18:02 No, no, literally, because now all the people,
01:18:04 the people who play in this war are all like children.
01:18:06 So they're gonna be in school on these days.
01:18:09 Oh.
01:18:10 Oh, no.
01:18:13 Well, we'll still have the weekend.
01:18:16 You just, you just gotta, you gotta,
01:18:17 you have the opportunity here.
01:18:18 No, no, no.
01:18:19 Don't you remember, Ben?
01:18:20 This is my last weekend.
01:18:21 Next weekend, I'm moving in.
01:18:22 Oh.
01:18:24 Well, ooh, uh, uh, uh, yeah, um.
01:18:30 This was it, Ben!
01:18:31 You should have had a bigger brain and a bigger dick,
01:18:36 so it's that this situation never arose
01:18:38 in the first place, Munchie.
01:18:40 I just call it.
01:18:41 You know what, this isn't Munchie's fault.
01:18:43 This is not Munchie's fault.
01:18:43 Shame him.
01:18:44 The UPS does this all the time.
01:18:48 They are under, I don't know if it's because
01:18:49 they're under a ton of pressure
01:18:50 or they're just fucking retards,
01:18:52 but constantly, they will not ring the doorbell.
01:18:55 They will not knock on the door.
01:18:56 They will just drive by your house sometimes,
01:18:59 like they weren't there, LeMau,
01:19:01 and they say it's a failed delivery.
01:19:03 This happens constantly.
01:19:05 Was it UPS?
01:19:06 I forget if it was UPS.
01:19:08 I don't know.
01:19:09 I don't remember if it was UPS or FedEx or whatever,
01:19:11 but one of the people that like,
01:19:13 I ordered the pins, right?
01:19:14 This was like a long time ago.
01:19:15 This was like way before I was even getting close
01:19:17 to getting it, which I am close to getting it done,
01:19:19 but for the Vapors 2 Kickstarter,
01:19:21 when I ordered the pins,
01:19:22 the new pins for the second Kickstarter,
01:19:24 and I ordered them,
01:19:25 and this was right as our parents moved house, right?
01:19:29 But obviously, if they moved,
01:19:30 they left instructions for like,
01:19:31 this is our new address,
01:19:33 but whoever was delivering them just didn't listen,
01:19:36 and they just said undeliverable,
01:19:38 and they just didn't deliver,
01:19:39 and they just disappeared,
01:19:40 and they just disappeared in the mail,
01:19:42 and I paid for the order,
01:19:44 they were shipped to them,
01:19:45 but they just threw them away
01:19:47 because they didn't go to the right address.
01:19:49 I just want to say that, again,
01:19:50 this is like a malicious thing on UPS's behalf, by the way.
01:19:54 I don't think this is like an accident.
01:19:56 I think this is a premeditated attack
01:19:58 on yours truly, Munchy Shatsky.
01:19:59 They're probably a bunch of killers, dude.
01:20:01 They're probably a bunch of killers.
01:20:02 Yeah, literally.
01:20:03 You know, yeah.
01:20:04 So, again, I just want to reiterate
01:20:05 that I called them incessantly,
01:20:07 just over and over and over again
01:20:08 to make sure that Patrick would be delivered time,
01:20:10 and then after I got the infuriating remark
01:20:12 that they tried to deliver it,
01:20:14 but were unable to,
01:20:15 motherfucker, you weren't even here.
01:20:16 I called them again, it was very stern,
01:20:18 and like, hey, what the fuck is your problem?
01:20:20 Like, what can I do?
01:20:20 I didn't say what the fuck is your problem.
01:20:21 I was like, I'm really upset right now.
01:20:23 Can you please explain why?
01:20:24 But I said it in a really stern tone.
01:20:26 And then, by the way, none of them were speaking English.
01:20:29 A single person was a native English speaker,
01:20:31 and I couldn't understand half their accents.
01:20:33 And then they had the gall to say,
01:20:35 oh, well, if you want to pick it up yourself,
01:20:38 you can on Monday.
01:20:39 That would be $35 to pick it up in person.
01:20:42 They charged me to do it in person
01:20:44 when they just couldn't fucking deliver it to me in person.
01:20:46 By the way,
01:20:47 by the way, I just want to say that that computer,
01:20:50 I didn't just, like, it wasn't just like, you know,
01:20:51 like, oh, I picked up in a bag and I took it to the UPS.
01:20:54 No, no, no, no.
01:20:54 So it was $200 to ship it to me,
01:20:59 because it's my computer,
01:21:00 and I had to get extra fragile shipping,
01:21:01 and there were like three boxes for all the stuff
01:21:03 that was accumulated with the monitor
01:21:05 and the desktop and everything else.
01:21:06 So a $200 to ship it to me,
01:21:08 probably is lost in transit and broken by now,
01:21:11 because it's just been loaded on and off a truck
01:21:12 so many times,
01:21:13 because they can't fucking speak anything.
01:21:16 They are just dumb.
01:21:16 They're stupid.
01:21:17 I hate them.
01:21:17 Yeah, yeah.
01:21:18 Time, time, murder.
01:21:19 So UPS, I have these problems all the time.
01:21:21 They, I have a doorbell.
01:21:23 They don't seem to ring it.
01:21:24 It sucks.
01:21:25 They're terrible.
01:21:25 But, but even worse, I don't know if you guys,
01:21:27 do you ever get like Amazon delivery from,
01:21:29 like, there's like an Amazon independent delivery system
01:21:32 that works like they've got, you know,
01:21:34 like independent people.
01:21:35 It's not UPS or FedEx.
01:21:36 It's Amazon.
01:21:36 They have their own shipping fleet now.
01:21:39 Yeah.
01:21:39 So, okay, obviously,
01:21:40 there are a million times worse than anyone else.
01:21:43 And like multiple times now,
01:21:45 at least twice.
01:21:46 There's been instances where like, I just,
01:21:49 and I've called them to ask their customer support.
01:21:51 They have told me this,
01:21:52 that they are delivering something.
01:21:54 They get here.
01:21:55 I'm checking.
01:21:55 They're like, oh, we couldn't deliver today.
01:21:57 I'm like, that's odd.
01:21:59 I checked the thing.
01:22:00 It says it was delivered.
01:22:01 I say, that's weird.
01:22:02 I call customer support and say, excuse me,
01:22:05 it says it was delivered.
01:22:05 It's not in my place.
01:22:06 What's going on?
01:22:07 They tell me, this has happened twice.
01:22:09 I'm pretty sure now, like, oh yeah,
01:22:11 sometimes our delivery guys
01:22:12 are just trying to meet a quota.
01:22:13 So they just put it down as delivered.
01:22:15 But it's not actually delivered.
01:22:17 Like, just hang on a couple more days.
01:22:19 And like, maybe it'll be there.
01:22:20 I understand, sir.
01:22:22 What?
01:22:23 Of course, sir.
01:22:24 Did Jeff, I would put Jeff Bezos on the phone.
01:22:27 I need to talk to the man in charge.
01:22:28 He needs to know what's going on.
01:22:29 This, this has happened to me multiple times.
01:22:32 I can't believe this is acceptable.
01:22:34 Five of the people who do this.
01:22:35 Have you ever had the bowling ball service before?
01:22:39 No, I don't think so.
01:22:40 This is something unique,
01:22:41 I guess maybe to my house,
01:22:42 because we have a driveway on a downward slant.
01:22:45 But sometimes they'll just park at the edge of the driveway
01:22:48 and just roll the package down our driveway and take off.
01:22:51 Wait.
01:22:53 And like, I got a laptop?
01:22:55 I got a laptop and I was waiting for it to come
01:22:57 and they just rolled the laptop box down my driveway.
01:23:00 And I ran, I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
01:23:02 But they're already driving away.
01:23:04 And yeah, yeah.
01:23:06 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:23:07 So they did this with a laptop?
01:23:08 Yeah.
01:23:10 It was just a box.
01:23:11 Uricle laptop?
01:23:12 How does it even roll down the...
01:23:13 They just take a box and they just pitch it
01:23:15 and it just starts rolling down the fucking...
01:23:18 Yeah, yeah.
01:23:20 This is the quality you get with the Amazon delivery system.
01:23:23 This is how they do it.
01:23:23 It's disgusting beyond words.
01:23:26 Deb, have you ever seen an Amazon graveyard?
01:23:29 Do you have any of those?
01:23:30 Like, because like, there's an old, there's a like a plaza
01:23:35 near my house that used to have like a stop
01:23:39 a chop at a bunch of other places.
01:23:40 There's still a couple small businesses there,
01:23:42 but it was bought by Amazon.
01:23:44 So the parking lot that used to support tons of businesses
01:23:46 is now just full, completely full of Amazon vans.
01:23:51 It's just like, and like, it's a big parking lot.
01:23:53 So like you drive, it takes like three minutes
01:23:55 to get across it and it's just a fucking ghost town
01:23:58 except for hundreds of Amazon branded vans.
01:24:02 And it's the most dystopian feeling of all time
01:24:04 going through there.
01:24:05 Are these the, is this the fleet doing the deliveries and like...
01:24:08 This is like where they keep all the vans
01:24:09 for all their contractors to do all their deliveries
01:24:11 because there's, they bought, there was an old
01:24:13 like caterpillar billing that they bought
01:24:15 and now it's an Amazon delivery service.
01:24:16 So like, they just bought the entire parking lot
01:24:19 to use as their parking lot for their vans.
01:24:22 And it's just literally hundreds.
01:24:24 And you're just like, oh, I remember when like,
01:24:27 people would come here and go grocery shopping
01:24:29 and now it's just a ghost town.
01:24:31 I know that other people disagree with me on this.
01:24:33 Like in a possible world, perhaps this is naive,
01:24:35 perhaps this is unrealistic, but in a world
01:24:38 where all power is constant, like we'll like,
01:24:40 where wealth and power are concentrated
01:24:42 in a very small number of people
01:24:43 and those people like do everything.
01:24:45 If those people don't do immoral things,
01:24:47 I don't have a problem with it.
01:24:48 Maybe that's naive, maybe it's inevitably gonna happen.
01:24:50 Okay, that's fine, we can discuss that.
01:24:52 But nonetheless, the fact that it's all being concentrated
01:24:55 in such a shitty system, in such a terrible,
01:24:58 awful fucking system where such things are just tolerated,
01:25:02 I guess it's tolerated the way that like,
01:25:04 YouTube recently like constantly tolerated people
01:25:06 abusing their copyright claim system
01:25:08 because there's just too many fucking people
01:25:11 with them making videos and with Amazon
01:25:12 just asking for bullshit that nobody cares about,
01:25:15 including me every day by an Amazon shit.
01:25:17 Oh my God, Nate, you're getting it.
01:25:20 You're starting to see through the veil.
01:25:21 My class consciousness is spiking right now.
01:25:23 My power levels are surging.
01:25:25 The problem is that like, in order to get far in the world,
01:25:30 you have to like inherently be a bad person.
01:25:33 Like that's just...
01:25:34 I don't agree with that.
01:25:35 I don't agree with that.
01:25:36 You kind of do.
01:25:37 You...
01:25:37 Now I totally agree with that.
01:25:39 Well, it depends.
01:25:39 In order to get to that upper, upper echelon,
01:25:42 like to really get to the tippity top,
01:25:43 like to get to the 1%, like to be like a student.
01:25:46 Okay, I've got a question.
01:25:47 I've got a question for you.
01:25:48 Okay, we all know that like,
01:25:49 if you're like a CEO of a gigantic company or something,
01:25:52 like basically any decision you make
01:25:54 is going to like benefit one group
01:25:56 and like penalize another group,
01:25:58 such that almost any decision you make
01:26:00 like has winners and losers
01:26:01 and those could be fairly serious.
01:26:03 Like people could like lose their jobs,
01:26:05 lose their livelihoods, you know,
01:26:06 could fuck them up.
01:26:07 But like you have to make decisions.
01:26:09 Like are you defining that as evil?
01:26:11 Because like a good person might just be paralyzed.
01:26:14 I would say that to get to the tippity top,
01:26:17 you have to be evil because you must,
01:26:19 like you must exploit,
01:26:21 you must exploit the work of employees
01:26:23 in order to like generate capital.
01:26:26 I don't even know, I mean that's true.
01:26:27 I don't know if I'd go that far
01:26:29 in what I'm talking about.
01:26:30 I just mean that in order to be the best,
01:26:33 you have to be overly aggressive to a point
01:26:36 that most people would find it morally uncomfortable.
01:26:39 Like you have to be,
01:26:40 you can't be afraid to step on other people
01:26:43 and like use a pile of like corporate corpses
01:26:47 to climb your way to the top.
01:26:48 That's just the way the system works
01:26:50 and most people don't have the stomach for it.
01:26:52 So inevitably the people who are at the top
01:26:54 are the people with very little more consideration.
01:26:56 If you're not 100%, if you're 99% ruthless,
01:27:03 that guy who's 100% ruthless is going to edge you out.
01:27:06 That's quite possible, that's quite possible.
01:27:07 If you're only 99% ruthless, you're in the 99%,
01:27:11 it's just how it is.
01:27:13 Yeah.
01:27:14 Ruthless is a world.
01:27:15 Is there such a thing as being ruthless?
01:27:17 Can I be a ruthless person?
01:27:18 Yeah, Ruth Grader Ginsburg.
01:27:20 Let's ask the Urban Dictionary show.
01:27:24 Welcome to the PCP, the topic is being ruthless.
01:27:26 Guys, how have you been ruthless lately?
01:27:30 Okay, top definition for Ruth.
01:27:33 Ruth is a very pretty girl
01:27:34 with the shiniest and prettiest brown eyes.
01:27:37 She has a warm heart and is very caring.
01:27:39 She could light up the whole room
01:27:40 with her presence around, especially with her humor.
01:27:42 One click by, one click by, one click by.
01:27:43 She can be the kindest person you have ever met.
01:27:46 She's very loving and the best person
01:27:48 to go to for a shoulder to cry on.
01:27:50 She will put her loved ones first and her friends second.
01:27:53 She is honest and loyal and has the prettiest smile.
01:27:57 Okay, all those, all those things.
01:27:58 Is that the girl, every girl?
01:28:00 Is that the girl everyone's been talking about?
01:28:02 Guy, sure is.
01:28:04 That's Ruth.
01:28:05 So I hope that's cleared it up for you.
01:28:07 That all defines Ruth.
01:28:08 Top definition of ruthless on,
01:28:10 so lack of this person is simply without Ruth,
01:28:14 lack of Ruth, no Ruth.
01:28:16 That's the full definition of ruthless.
01:28:21 Thank you for helping us be thanks guys.
01:28:23 So if you're Ruthless, then you're an incel
01:28:25 and you don't have a pretty girl with shiny,
01:28:27 pretty brown eyes.
01:28:28 Correct, and that's what turns you evil.
01:28:31 What else sets the stage for a corporate takeover
01:28:34 of society than not having a Ruth in your life?
01:28:36 Damn.
01:28:37 That all makes sense.
01:28:38 I'm just gonna say right now, the radicals are Ruthful.
01:28:41 The radicals are a Ruthful race.
01:28:44 A routful, rooty, race, revunctious rats.
01:28:47 Killers are Ruthless.
01:28:49 Killers are absolutely Ruthless.
01:28:50 They're the Ruthless.
01:28:51 That's the difference.
01:28:52 That's the difference in world view.
01:28:54 We're just imbued with so much Ruth,
01:28:56 that it's just, I really don't have a picture of Ruth.
01:28:58 I think this is why, I think this is why
01:29:00 more Slime Corp employees gravitate towards the,
01:29:04 towards the killer side.
01:29:05 Because one of the first psychological checks you do
01:29:07 when you're entering Slime Corp evaluation is,
01:29:09 do you have empathy?
01:29:11 If so, get out right now.
01:29:12 You just leave, leave the premises.
01:29:14 You'll get edged out in the free market.
01:29:16 If you have, if you have Ruth.
01:29:18 You just slide a picture of Ruth
01:29:19 over to the potential employee.
01:29:21 What's the first thing that comes to your mind?
01:29:23 Depending on their answer.
01:29:24 When they slide that picture of Ruth over,
01:29:25 you need that like Russian propaganda picture of that guy
01:29:28 holding up his hand going,
01:29:29 HIT!
01:29:30 Saying, you know.
01:29:31 Well, I just want to put like a little bow tie
01:29:33 on the UPS store.
01:29:34 I just want to say that it wouldn't bother me so much
01:29:38 if it weren't for like just the deception.
01:29:40 If it was just incompetency,
01:29:42 like if it was just like they like fucked up,
01:29:45 or even if it's like a scummy worker
01:29:46 that just is like trying to fill up a quota.
01:29:48 Even that is like, you know, fun.
01:29:51 It's the fact that like every single,
01:29:53 like I feel like there's nothing I can do
01:29:55 because I am constantly getting positive affirmation
01:29:57 that what's happening is going to be okay.
01:29:59 Like I'm getting constant like we have your address.
01:30:02 They're gaslighting you.
01:30:03 They're gaslighting you in a bigger way.
01:30:05 Like like in the exact same day,
01:30:07 I will, I will call them and like say,
01:30:09 this is my address.
01:30:10 Make sure you're delivering it right.
01:30:11 Because it doesn't look like you're delivering it
01:30:12 to the right address on your website.
01:30:13 And they'll be like, okay, you know, we've updated it.
01:30:15 Okay, so it's going to this address.
01:30:16 Okay, good.
01:30:17 Don't worry.
01:30:17 We're going to this address.
01:30:18 Like the same day, like,
01:30:20 oh, your address was wrong, by the way.
01:30:22 We didn't get your company name.
01:30:23 We need your company name for some reason.
01:30:26 We just assume.
01:30:27 Rowdy fuckers, cop killers.
01:30:29 We kill crime HQ.
01:30:31 Yeah, come on.
01:30:32 This is, this is why I like dealing with USPS
01:30:34 because like they're incompetent,
01:30:36 but it's they're always on the nose about it.
01:30:37 Like, you know what you're getting into
01:30:39 when you deal with a post office, you know?
01:30:41 Yeah.
01:30:42 There's a bunch of slums who just don't give a shit.
01:30:44 And they don't pretend to.
01:30:45 Yeah.
01:30:45 Yeah.
01:30:46 I mean, I've had issues with the post office,
01:30:47 but it's never been a rigmarole.
01:30:49 It's just like, yeah, we fucked up.
01:30:50 Sorry.
01:30:51 Mike, go fuck yourself.
01:30:53 Just in case anyone was wondering,
01:30:55 yes, it seems that Ruth, spelled with an E before the U,
01:30:59 was a middle, was a middle English word,
01:31:01 meaning pity or compassion,
01:31:03 has fallen out of use.
01:31:05 So that's where that comes from.
01:31:07 Hell yeah.
01:31:07 So I was just taking a big old shit and.
01:31:10 You did type an emergency.
01:31:11 That's what was urgent.
01:31:12 And that was an emergency.
01:31:13 I said BRB, urgent shit.
01:31:15 Oh, I didn't think you meant like it was literally a shit that
01:31:18 was urgent.
01:31:18 I had to take it back.
01:31:22 All right.
01:31:22 So I went to took an urgent shit and I was reading the manga
01:31:26 Planetes, the previous copyright over here.
01:31:31 From the guy who wrote Vinland Saga.
01:31:32 Have you read it yet, Nate?
01:31:33 It's by the guy who made Vinland Saga.
01:31:35 Yeah, I didn't even fucking realize that either.
01:31:36 Are you?
01:31:37 I had no fucking idea.
01:31:38 I only got like.
01:31:39 You'll be like, oh, OK, I got like two.
01:31:41 I mean, that was from way back in the day, right?
01:31:43 Oh, that that blows my mind.
01:31:45 I mean, obviously I just made a wee Agwa about fucking
01:31:47 Vinland Saga.
01:31:47 I'm a big fan.
01:31:48 Yeah, blew my mind, too.
01:31:49 OK.
01:31:50 Well, I was just reading it.
01:31:51 Well, I guess if you've already read the first couple
01:31:53 chapters, then I don't know.
01:31:54 You probably don't remember them, but like.
01:31:56 I just spent a while.
01:31:57 Chapter two seemed like it would interest you a lot.
01:31:58 It was about the main character.
01:32:00 So for those who don't know, Planetes is about people who
01:32:05 are junk collectors in space.
01:32:06 They collect space debris.
01:32:08 They're literally just trash men.
01:32:09 It's mostly about like the economic disparity of how we
01:32:13 treat people who do like blue collar jobs, essentially
01:32:16 even in space.
01:32:18 And in chapter two, the main character is like having
01:32:21 his doubts about whether space is cool.
01:32:23 He's like, space is kind of shit.
01:32:26 You know, everybody out here just kind of gets cancer
01:32:28 and loses their mind.
01:32:29 So it's not that great.
01:32:30 It's a tale of learning to love space.
01:32:33 Well, he was just like, man, what the fuck is the point?
01:32:35 Because like back on Earth, it takes place in a period
01:32:38 where like the sea levels have already risen.
01:32:40 We've used up most of the natural resources.
01:32:41 Did we buy Greenland, though?
01:32:43 I don't know.
01:32:44 I mean, I don't even know what country he's from necessarily
01:32:47 because it's in space.
01:32:49 But they're on the moon.
01:32:52 They have like a moon base.
01:32:53 It's basically like we've colonized the moon to some extent.
01:32:55 And we've got spaceships and stuff.
01:32:58 We've explored the outer belt, I guess, or inner belts
01:33:02 or whatever belt.
01:33:03 Anyways, he's like, I don't know, man.
01:33:06 Maybe fucking we weren't supposed to come to space.
01:33:09 And then the other lady's like, man, fuck you, dude.
01:33:12 We got to be in space.
01:33:14 It's the only way forward for humanity.
01:33:15 Like we just got to do it.
01:33:17 And then he meets this girl who was born on the moon.
01:33:19 And she's like, I can't even go to Earth
01:33:22 because like my body can't handle their atmosphere.
01:33:26 But like I'm letting them study me for science.
01:33:29 And I want them to fucking figure out how to progress
01:33:31 and fix a lot of these problems that we have with space.
01:33:33 And he's like, you know what?
01:33:35 Maybe space isn't so bad.
01:33:37 It's got space in the place.
01:33:39 Hashtag to my 2003.
01:33:40 I thought you'd appreciate it, Nate, because it's just like he's
01:33:42 having his doubts about human progress
01:33:44 and whether it's all worth it.
01:33:46 And then this girl from space is like, nah, dude.
01:33:50 That was a good chapter.
01:33:50 This guy's, fuck.
01:33:51 These guys are living and doing real shit,
01:33:54 facing real issues.
01:33:55 But like ultimately, I mean, what are you going to do?
01:33:57 Good chapter also though, long.
01:33:59 Not, I was, you know, I'm just trying to read a chapter
01:34:02 while I take a shit and get back to the PCP.
01:34:04 And I'm like, oh God, like what the fuck does this end?
01:34:07 I have to go back.
01:34:08 I'm going to get a penalty if I fucking miss too much.
01:34:11 People have been telling me for a long time
01:34:12 that I should, you know, read, watch whatever
01:34:15 Planet is because I would love it.
01:34:16 I never, I didn't get that far into it,
01:34:18 but I read a bunch.
01:34:20 It's funny, Nate, that you haven't like read it completely
01:34:23 because you gave it to me as a gift, like the first one.
01:34:25 I know, I know.
01:34:26 And you were talking up like, yeah, this is great.
01:34:28 You'll love it.
01:34:28 And I was like, oh, this must be a favorite of Nate's.
01:34:30 And you're just like, yeah, I never read it.
01:34:32 Well, people told me that and I read some of it
01:34:35 and thought it was great.
01:34:37 So I'll get, I'll finish it one of these days.
01:34:40 Speaking of, it's not even that long.
01:34:42 Yeah, I think you're right.
01:34:42 I think you're right.
01:34:43 Speaking of reading, what a common thing, right?
01:34:49 I don't want to get too deep into all the punk ass
01:34:53 bitches in the comments last episode railing against me,
01:34:58 but one common refrain was that, oh, Ben, oh, Ben, just what?
01:35:02 Ben's just parroting a bunch of YouTube people.
01:35:04 Ben, just watch, he uses the talking mouthpiece
01:35:08 for all these YouTube, he's never even read a book.
01:35:11 Well, I read a book.
01:35:12 I finished Peter Kropotkin's Conquest of Bread yesterday.
01:35:18 And here's my, here's my review of it.
01:35:22 It's, it's, it's informative, but it's very outdated.
01:35:26 He talks a lot.
01:35:27 Okay.
01:35:28 He talks, he talks a lot about why we should communism,
01:35:31 which cool, a lot of that comes off as kind of
01:35:34 sermonizing, but I don't mind that.
01:35:35 It's pretty good.
01:35:36 I like it.
01:35:37 And a lot of it is him talking about like, okay,
01:35:40 but how will we do the revolution?
01:35:43 How will we survive?
01:35:44 How will we feed ourselves?
01:35:46 And there's a lot of nitty gritty, like with
01:35:48 intensive farming methods.
01:35:49 Here's how many bushels per acre,
01:35:51 you know, the typical Parisian farmer could produce.
01:35:54 And, and, and it's very outdated.
01:35:56 And he's like, did you know that in America,
01:35:59 they actually, certain cities actually pump hot water
01:36:02 into homes in addition to cold water?
01:36:04 We could do that too, guys.
01:36:05 The future is going to be fucking sick.
01:36:07 Okay.
01:36:07 Okay.
01:36:08 So it's, it's pretty short though.
01:36:10 How, do you know when he wrote it and where he's from?
01:36:12 I just, so I,
01:36:13 Well, he's, he's from Russia.
01:36:14 Okay.
01:36:15 Russian.
01:36:15 Ben.
01:36:16 I don't know the exact year.
01:36:17 Okay.
01:36:17 Ben, if you're going to be reading political books,
01:36:19 I have one I recommend, which is fucking Yang's book.
01:36:23 I read it.
01:36:24 Oh, the war on normal.
01:36:25 Yeah, I read it and it was great.
01:36:27 And I agree with everything he has to say.
01:36:30 Yang is my man.
01:36:32 Yang is pretty cool.
01:36:32 I won't say agree with everything he has to say,
01:36:34 but most of it, like the vast majority of the
01:36:37 just his perspective on,
01:36:39 I think the most important thing about Yang to me
01:36:42 is not just his ideas of like what to do,
01:36:44 but just the fact that he seems to actually know
01:36:47 what's happening.
01:36:48 Like the thing that I've been saying about like
01:36:51 all the politicians and stuff is like,
01:36:53 they're talking about plans of action for a world
01:36:56 that to me doesn't exist.
01:36:58 You know, that I'm like,
01:36:59 that's not the way things are though.
01:37:01 Like if you're not taking into account the internet,
01:37:04 you don't understand how like
01:37:06 the businesses are run there,
01:37:08 then you don't know what the fuck the world even is
01:37:10 right now.
01:37:10 You know, and we know.
01:37:11 I mean, Yang's like 40 something.
01:37:13 Yeah.
01:37:13 Yang's like 40 something.
01:37:15 All the other like of so many of the other
01:37:16 Democratic candidates are like 80 plus.
01:37:18 He's like 40 something.
01:37:19 And he's his whole entire background is working
01:37:21 it for startups.
01:37:22 You know, like all he's done.
01:37:23 He's also a gamer.
01:37:24 He is.
01:37:25 He played a lot of Starcraft.
01:37:26 Starcraft player.
01:37:27 Yeah.
01:37:27 Yeah.
01:37:28 He mentioned, he thought there's a whole chapter
01:37:30 about gaming in the book about like basically
01:37:32 how video games have.
01:37:34 How they need to rise up.
01:37:35 Well, mostly he's talking about how he's like,
01:37:38 you know, I understand video games and how
01:37:40 addicting they are and like why they're so good,
01:37:42 but they are ruining our men like.
01:37:45 Yeah.
01:37:45 He's he's it's a case.
01:37:47 I know is like the type of men he describes are
01:37:51 literally guys.
01:37:52 I know like guys who have completely been
01:37:55 subsumed into putting the focus on the wrong
01:37:57 people.
01:37:58 Women need to compete with video games with
01:38:00 enhanced surgically enhanced sexiness.
01:38:02 It's the only way to keep the arms race going.
01:38:05 We have to do it.
01:38:06 Yang is pretty cool.
01:38:07 I like him.
01:38:08 I know I've been hyping him up.
01:38:09 I've been hyping him up on Twitter lately,
01:38:10 selling Yang shirts.
01:38:12 It's all pretty great.
01:38:13 I'm not voting for him.
01:38:14 My motto is vote.
01:38:15 Well, he won't win anyway, so.
01:38:16 Vote Bernie where Yang.
01:38:17 Yeah, I'm voting Bernie.
01:38:18 I love if the polls changed and like Yang surged
01:38:21 ahead, I would vote for him.
01:38:22 Okay.
01:38:22 But like he's not going to win.
01:38:23 I'm going to vote for Bernie because he can
01:38:25 actually and also I like Bernie.
01:38:26 Let's say you had the vote.
01:38:27 Your only vote mattered.
01:38:28 You are.
01:38:29 No, throw.
01:38:30 Okay.
01:38:31 Okay.
01:38:31 Did you throw your vote away on Yang so
01:38:33 Biden will win.
01:38:34 Great.
01:38:34 Thanks.
01:38:35 Thanks a lot.
01:38:36 Okay.
01:38:36 You're talking about like what if you just don't
01:38:37 care.
01:38:38 He's right.
01:38:38 I don't know.
01:38:39 Yeah, I'm talking about what makes you think
01:38:41 that like I would not vote for Bernie.
01:38:43 Like I wouldn't do that.
01:38:44 Why would you not vote for?
01:38:45 Oh my god.
01:38:46 Why would you not vote for Bernie?
01:38:47 I wouldn't vote for anybody but Yang.
01:38:49 I would not vote for anybody but Yang.
01:38:51 Peer.
01:38:51 Oh my god.
01:38:52 Digi, you don't understand.
01:38:54 You don't understand.
01:38:54 What do I not understand?
01:38:55 What's the stake?
01:38:56 Fucking Biden's going to win.
01:38:58 Biden.
01:38:58 Okay, Biden's not going to win.
01:38:59 Like you, Biden's going to win.
01:39:01 All right.
01:39:01 First of all, none of them are going to be
01:39:04 Trump.
01:39:04 No, he's way worse than Obama.
01:39:06 He sucks.
01:39:06 Okay.
01:39:07 Also, he's literally demented.
01:39:09 Like he's clearly has like brain.
01:39:11 He does not seem particularly on the ball.
01:39:12 He is not on the, he's not on the fucking ball.
01:39:16 I agree.
01:39:17 And Bernie fucking rules, okay?
01:39:18 I don't know if you know anything about
01:39:19 Bernie but Bernie rules.
01:39:21 If the Democrats pick Joe Biden, they will
01:39:23 be just signing their death warrant.
01:39:25 There's no profit.
01:39:26 Exactly.
01:39:27 Yeah, that seems true.
01:39:28 It seems true.
01:39:28 Yes.
01:39:29 That's one, that's one of the things I'm
01:39:31 saying to you.
01:39:32 From what I've heard,
01:39:33 Bernie is currently third behind Warren and Biden.
01:39:35 Here's the thing.
01:39:36 Here's the thing about Yang.
01:39:37 I like Yang.
01:39:37 He's not going to win.
01:39:38 But he's young, right?
01:39:40 Like he can run again.
01:39:41 Well, that's why you have to vote for him
01:39:44 because you need to build up the
01:39:45 cachet of his reputation.
01:39:47 But he's, I want like you.
01:39:50 Okay.
01:39:50 Look, Democratic Party.
01:39:51 I see what you're saying, but I don't agree.
01:39:53 Nobody, none of the Democratic candidates
01:39:55 have a fucking chance against Trump.
01:39:57 Maybe Yang would, but he's not big enough.
01:39:59 No, Bernie could win.
01:40:01 I start, Bernie could absolutely win.
01:40:02 I don't know.
01:40:03 I don't know about that.
01:40:03 He could, he could have won in 2016.
01:40:05 He could win in 2012.
01:40:06 A lot of people do not like Trump.
01:40:06 Bernie is the only one who I think would
01:40:08 even have a chance, but like.
01:40:10 Exactly.
01:40:10 I also think that.
01:40:12 Exactly, exactly, did she?
01:40:14 I don't think he would.
01:40:15 Oh my God.
01:40:17 Well, okay.
01:40:17 I don't agree.
01:40:18 Whatever.
01:40:18 Man, what happened to hating boomers?
01:40:20 Let's bring back the hatred of old people.
01:40:22 That's the bad I know and love.
01:40:23 There's a, there's a small undercurrent.
01:40:25 Okay.
01:40:25 There's a small undercurrent.
01:40:27 Bernie's the good kind of boomer.
01:40:28 Bernie like threw trash at like,
01:40:31 separatists during the civil rights movement and stuff.
01:40:34 Bernie's a champion.
01:40:34 This conversation is the war on normal people.
01:40:39 Wait, hold on a minute.
01:40:40 Wait, I want to.
01:40:41 Speaking of books, speaking of books,
01:40:42 there's another, there is a book that I do really want to read
01:40:44 that's called Bullshit Jobs.
01:40:45 Uh-huh.
01:40:46 You ever heard of that one?
01:40:47 I don't think so.
01:40:47 It is just, it's just about how like.
01:40:49 Every job, every job.
01:40:50 It's just about how like most job,
01:40:51 or like tons of jobs.
01:40:53 I mean, in, in like the modern world.
01:40:55 Hey, hey, you know how.
01:40:56 Literally do not contribute anything.
01:40:57 You know how micro does that show dirty jobs?
01:41:00 They exist purely to be middlemen who like just,
01:41:02 just like do not contribute to the actual chain of supply.
01:41:07 Micro does that job dirty jobs.
01:41:08 I want to do my show bullshit jobs.
01:41:10 Just too pointless.
01:41:12 Don't add value to the world or anyone.
01:41:14 That's, that's going to be my show.
01:41:15 You're already doing the bullshit job right now.
01:41:17 We're all fucking on YouTube.
01:41:18 Yeah.
01:41:18 You're right.
01:41:19 By Dave, David, Bullshit Jobs by David Graber.
01:41:21 This is a book I've been hearing about a lot
01:41:23 that I want to read.
01:41:23 I have two books.
01:41:24 One for Ben and one for the audience.
01:41:26 For Ben, I recommend God and the State
01:41:29 by Mikal Bakunin.
01:41:31 Mikal Bakunin.
01:41:32 God and the State.
01:41:33 Oh Bakunin.
01:41:33 Oh Bakunin.
01:41:34 Bakunin is the guy who thinks inheritance is immoral.
01:41:36 He's my boy.
01:41:37 Yeah.
01:41:37 Basculean.
01:41:37 Basculean.
01:41:38 Bananas.
01:41:39 Yes.
01:41:39 I understand now.
01:41:39 Yes.
01:41:40 Bananas.
01:41:41 Okay.
01:41:41 That's right.
01:41:42 So I've been, it warrants my heart that you actually
01:41:44 paid attention to a reference or like a reference
01:41:46 that I gave you.
01:41:48 Yeah.
01:41:48 The, that, that, the revolution.
01:41:49 Yeah.
01:41:50 I listened to the, I want to go back and listen to more
01:41:52 because there's probably more.
01:41:52 Oh yeah.
01:41:53 Oh, there's way more.
01:41:54 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:41:54 Yeah.
01:41:55 Oh God.
01:41:56 It's so cool that bird, bird.
01:41:58 Dude.
01:41:58 Okay.
01:41:59 I, I was good.
01:41:59 We're talking about theories.
01:42:01 What's the other book though?
01:42:03 Well, hold on.
01:42:03 Wait.
01:42:03 Actually before that, because this is way more important.
01:42:05 I was pacing back and forth last night again,
01:42:08 as I mentioned, just running back and forth in my room,
01:42:10 just seething in anger about UPS.
01:42:13 And I got thinking about how like it's,
01:42:15 it's sort of a weird melodramatic statement.
01:42:18 But I don't mean it any such thing,
01:42:19 but I almost feel like I don't relate to anyone anymore.
01:42:23 Not that I have surpassed them in any level of intellect,
01:42:26 not even remotely that, but just as in like,
01:42:29 I feel as though my interests are so different
01:42:31 from the people I surround myself with,
01:42:33 that like we just have different interests.
01:42:34 And it's not a bad or good thing.
01:42:36 It just is a difference in taste.
01:42:39 And hashtag parents will never get it.
01:42:40 Got it.
01:42:41 No, no.
01:42:41 That's, specifically, no.
01:42:44 What you are describing is how I ended up in the internet
01:42:47 and in this group.
01:42:49 Like this is exactly, it was just like a gradual process
01:42:52 of like the more I got into being a YouTuber
01:42:55 and doing things that not, that most people don't do,
01:42:59 the more it's like my friends just literally can't relate.
01:43:02 It's just like, it wasn't like we had a falling out
01:43:04 or we stopped being friends or anything.
01:43:05 It's like they were into playing video games.
01:43:07 I was into making YouTube videos.
01:43:09 And like they didn't really want to make YouTube videos.
01:43:12 And I didn't really want to play video games.
01:43:13 And like the only people I could find
01:43:16 who I could really relate to are other people
01:43:18 who were doing not just YouTube videos,
01:43:20 but like a similar type.
01:43:22 Like that's kind of how this group got formed.
01:43:24 It's like, oh, these are all people who are not just even
01:43:27 like doing my little pony analysis videos,
01:43:30 but like doing it with a certain attitude of like being capable
01:43:35 of like a more in-depth analysis,
01:43:37 but not taking it seriously, having this attitude of like,
01:43:40 yeah, we could just have fun and be kind of edgy.
01:43:43 And you know, just like analyze this show
01:43:46 because it's entertaining to do
01:43:48 and intellectually stimulating exercise.
01:43:51 But like, you know, it's like, yeah,
01:43:54 these are the only people doing this,
01:43:55 something close enough to what I'm doing
01:43:57 that I can even have a conversation
01:43:58 about the things that I'm, that like matter to me.
01:44:01 Cause like even, you can't even like talk to fans
01:44:04 or like other kinds of creators
01:44:06 if you're just trying to talk about like the reception
01:44:08 of your work or like what it's like to do this job.
01:44:11 No one fucking gets it at all, you know?
01:44:13 And you can like, you can make it vague enough
01:44:16 that other people kind of get it.
01:44:18 You know, you can kind of say, you know,
01:44:20 use metaphor to some extent to make people understand
01:44:24 like what you're dealing with,
01:44:25 but like just the specifics of it,
01:44:26 it's like, it's, it's a new job.
01:44:29 No one's done it and nobody gets it.
01:44:30 It is definitely the most alienating hell imaginable
01:44:34 and you will lose everyone you love and care about.
01:44:37 That is definitely true.
01:44:38 Those are maybe a negative.
01:44:39 I'm feeling that didgy, but not so much for what I'm doing.
01:44:43 More so like, it's funny that you use that metaphor
01:44:45 as in like what got you into this group,
01:44:48 whereas suppose I feel it's almost shifting away,
01:44:50 not in a, in a, in a, and again,
01:44:52 it's like so easy to take the words I'm saying
01:44:54 and assign like a malice or a sort of like, I don't know,
01:44:58 even a victim hood, that's not all I mean.
01:45:00 I'll even expand on what I said and say,
01:45:02 like I feel the same way about this group too,
01:45:04 that I don't talk to these guys as much
01:45:06 because we're not as much all doing the exact same thing.
01:45:09 And like all of us kind of have other stuff going on that like,
01:45:13 we're definitely in late stage PCP.
01:45:16 Yeah.
01:45:16 This is going down soon.
01:45:18 It's like, it's harder for me to communicate
01:45:20 with like Munchie or Ben because,
01:45:22 or anybody who's in the fucking endless war
01:45:24 because I don't participate in it
01:45:26 and like a huge amount of the conversation.
01:45:29 Like for anybody wondering, like when we get together now,
01:45:32 if you get Ben and Munchie in the same room,
01:45:34 it is an endless war of endless war.
01:45:37 It's just endless war all the time.
01:45:40 And it's like, I literally don't know
01:45:43 what they're talking about.
01:45:44 So like.
01:45:45 I understand Digi in this war's rock.
01:45:49 I click the link in the description.
01:45:50 I feel whenever I get on the PCP,
01:45:53 I have shows where it's like,
01:45:54 the core appeal is my personality
01:45:57 and I'm selling my ideas for, you know,
01:46:00 I'm to the people, to the masses,
01:46:02 the PCP and RFCK, the show.
01:46:04 And it's weird because I get on these
01:46:07 and I'm like, okay, I'm ready to talk
01:46:09 and I have ideas in my mind
01:46:10 that I'm really passionate about
01:46:11 and I think about it.
01:46:12 I meditate on day in and day out.
01:46:14 And I get on like, oh wait, like I would be really boring
01:46:17 if I were to just like monologue for like an hour
01:46:20 and then like say a thing
01:46:21 and then like no one has anything to input on
01:46:23 because none of them are thinking
01:46:24 or care about the same things I do.
01:46:26 And a chief among them, I mean, there's more than this,
01:46:28 but chief among them is like the thing
01:46:31 that I always bring up and feel super embarrassed about
01:46:33 which is history, where there's no way you can say
01:46:36 that you like history
01:46:37 without being a fucking pretentious snob.
01:46:39 And just, and people like,
01:46:40 even when they hear the words history, they're like,
01:46:42 oh God, look at the, who does this guy think he fucking is?
01:46:45 Whereas I've always maintained that just is anime,
01:46:48 just is media, history just is like a cartoon show
01:46:51 that you watch.
01:46:52 And it's interesting the exact same,
01:46:54 literally exact same ways that any other show would be.
01:46:57 So that's where most of my ideas come from
01:46:59 and most of what I'm thinking about.
01:47:01 The book that I was going to recommend
01:47:02 is a 32 hour Napoleon biography,
01:47:06 Napoleon A Life by Andrew Roberts.
01:47:07 Fantastic, great book.
01:47:09 And I just had so many ideas
01:47:10 and I was thinking so much about it
01:47:12 about all the quotes from Napoleon,
01:47:13 all the ups and turns of that.
01:47:14 I just wanted to talk to someone about it so badly
01:47:17 and just suggest it, but like there's no one
01:47:18 I can do that with that I know.
01:47:20 Like there's absolutely no one, like no one would care.
01:47:23 Like it's-
01:47:24 I care.
01:47:25 I care about Napoleon.
01:47:25 I remember the time that he went to the water park,
01:47:27 that was really cool.
01:47:30 Oh!
01:47:31 Yeah.
01:47:32 Yeah.
01:47:32 Trash.
01:47:35 I, it's boring for both people, right?
01:47:37 Where it's like, it's boring for someone who doesn't care
01:47:40 to be like, oh yeah, he's like just saying things to me now.
01:47:43 Like he's just repeating a thing
01:47:44 that has happened before, yawn.
01:47:46 It's also boring for me
01:47:47 because it's like I'm just saying a thing to someone
01:47:49 and then they're like, cool.
01:47:50 You know, there's no conversation.
01:47:51 There's no actual discussion of things.
01:47:53 It's fucking, it's boring.
01:47:55 I feel like stifled, but not in like,
01:47:57 again, it's not like an outward,
01:47:59 like people have done it to me.
01:48:01 It's just like, I don't know.
01:48:02 I don't know how to fix it.
01:48:03 I don't know how I got on this.
01:48:04 I don't know, I started talking about this.
01:48:05 Munchy, did you read God in the State?
01:48:07 Yeah, I haven't finished it, but I read like,
01:48:10 I think I read like a third of it.
01:48:12 Munchy, here's what I reckon about, unironically.
01:48:15 Podcast.
01:48:17 I'm glad you reminded me about Bacuna.
01:48:18 Podcast about all these things
01:48:20 because what I found in,
01:48:22 this is what I originally loved about Twitter
01:48:24 and it's also true of just anywhere.
01:48:27 If you just like talk about something in a big enough sphere
01:48:31 where enough people see it,
01:48:33 guaranteed one of them cares.
01:48:35 So like, if you make a podcast about Napoleon,
01:48:38 like 99% chance somebody in your comments
01:48:42 knows even more about Napoleon than you do
01:48:44 and would love to have a conversation
01:48:46 about Napoleon with you, you know?
01:48:48 So like, you just got to kind of like farm around.
01:48:51 You know, you just got to like make public,
01:48:52 cause like, I think I described Twitter once
01:48:55 as a place where you could just announce your desire
01:48:58 to have a conversation with somebody
01:49:00 to as many people as possible
01:49:02 and maybe one of them wants to have that conversation,
01:49:05 you know, which is something that, you know,
01:49:07 you can't do at home.
01:49:08 It's just there's not enough people around you
01:49:09 with the same interests.
01:49:10 It's fun you bring up that specific thing
01:49:13 because last night, again, I was, oh, you PS Minecraft,
01:49:16 did you bro?
01:49:17 Because I was thinking a lot about the whirling dervish
01:49:19 about how I really, really have enjoyed it so far
01:49:22 and I listened to all of it.
01:49:23 Yeah, and I've gotten really like,
01:49:26 because more and more I felt like, yeah,
01:49:29 conversations are good
01:49:31 and like I love listening to podcasts
01:49:33 when both the co-house are on the same page, right?
01:49:36 But like, there's something so direct
01:49:38 about the whirling dervish
01:49:39 because just is like you just saying what you believe
01:49:41 and it's not like, it's not like you are saying it
01:49:44 and then the other person just has to constantly give like,
01:49:47 yeah, or it's like they butt in about like,
01:49:49 I don't know, just whatever, you know,
01:49:51 you could just have like a full complete point
01:49:53 and it feels so much more dense than another thing.
01:49:56 Even if it had the exact same content,
01:49:58 just the idea that there's another person there
01:50:00 who like isn't speaking can like clutter the perception
01:50:02 of it just being like a one-sided conversation
01:50:05 that feels somewhat awkward.
01:50:06 So I love that, I was thinking about that.
01:50:08 And last night, I don't know, I think I said this earlier,
01:50:11 but I opened up a voice recorder
01:50:13 and I just wanted to speak aloud.
01:50:15 I was going to write down all my thoughts,
01:50:16 but writing is really agonizing for me
01:50:19 and I hate it even when it's extremely conscious.
01:50:20 Like it just, there's just something wrong with my brain.
01:50:22 And so I wanted to talk aloud and just speak to myself.
01:50:25 I thought it'd be awkward.
01:50:26 So I just recorded a podcast that I wasn't going to release.
01:50:29 I might release it now,
01:50:29 but it was literally what you were describing
01:50:31 just like about the point about what I was thinking about.
01:50:33 And also just like all about what I have just described today.
01:50:35 I had practiced around for this very podcast last night.
01:50:38 Yeah, I mean, I've done that plenty of times as well.
01:50:40 Just like recorded a podcast about something
01:50:43 and then just been like, yeah, well,
01:50:45 I understand that I wanted to get that off my chest,
01:50:47 but that was not interesting.
01:50:49 So I just throw it away, you know.
01:50:51 Did you guys know that dinosaurs are a conspiracy?
01:50:55 They're not real.
01:50:56 They never existed.
01:50:58 I just know that endless jess is a conspiracy.
01:51:00 I think I've probably believed you.
01:51:01 He's actually an ARG that I created.
01:51:03 What's the basis of this?
01:51:04 I've been getting really into this no dinosaurs conspiracy.
01:51:08 All right, I want to know.
01:51:09 Cause I mean, like, I'm sad about it.
01:51:12 I'm already engaged.
01:51:13 I mean, like I'm really, I'm really actually upset about it
01:51:15 because like my baseline is that I believe
01:51:18 every conspiracy is true until proven otherwise.
01:51:21 So if I just hear something that sounds like outrageous enough,
01:51:24 I'm like, oh no, that must be true.
01:51:26 Oh no, the world's even worse than I thought it was.
01:51:29 And so I found out there's no dinosaurs
01:51:31 that it was all made up.
01:51:34 There's a guy who like, I guess like they, you know,
01:51:38 paleontologists are only allowed to dig in certain areas
01:51:41 and they came in and they put the bones there
01:51:43 and the bones are made up
01:51:44 and they were made out of salt or something,
01:51:45 some shit, I don't know.
01:51:47 It made no sense, but I believe it.
01:51:49 God put them there to trick us into thinking
01:51:52 that evolution was there.
01:51:53 Well, yeah, that's the thing.
01:51:55 It's like a subset of the evolution as a myth conspiracy.
01:52:00 You know guys, I believe the Creeges Museum in Kentucky
01:52:03 right across the river from here
01:52:04 and they have confirmed, they have confirmed for me
01:52:07 that man, dinosaurs were on the ark with Noah.
01:52:11 They just died of unrelated causes afterward.
01:52:14 Well, I hope so because that's better than the alternative.
01:52:16 The dinosaurs were totally fake and never existed
01:52:19 because the idea that they existed as we believe,
01:52:21 I don't believe that anymore.
01:52:23 I already saw the conspiracy
01:52:24 so I have to believe it.
01:52:25 Sounds right.
01:52:26 You know, yeah, because I guess,
01:52:28 I think the gist of it was that like the powers that be
01:52:31 don't want us to believe the truth,
01:52:33 which is that God created Adam and Eve
01:52:35 and they wrote on dinosaurs or something.
01:52:37 Okay.
01:52:38 No, they want us to believe that there were dinosaurs
01:52:41 and then people were monkeys and then came into,
01:52:44 I don't know, the point is some guy said it,
01:52:46 so I believe it, fuck it, and I'm sad now.
01:52:49 I want there to be dinosaurs.
01:52:50 You know what?
01:52:51 Conspiracies are bullshit.
01:52:52 I'm not a conspiracy guy anymore.
01:52:54 I'm totally, in fact, I'm anti-conspiracy.
01:52:56 I don't believe anything anyone tells me unless it's cool.
01:52:59 You know what?
01:53:00 That's my new philosophy.
01:53:00 Forget all my previous philosophies.
01:53:02 My new philosophy is only believe what's cool.
01:53:04 And if you hear something that sounds cool, it's true.
01:53:06 And if you hear something, no, no.
01:53:08 And if it sounds bad, then it's not true.
01:53:10 That's, it doesn't know, fake and real are constructs.
01:53:13 Honestly, that's like a healthy way to live.
01:53:14 That's like a real way to live.
01:53:16 What if I think like basically everything sounds cool
01:53:19 no matter how bad it is?
01:53:20 Like, am I the only one who,
01:53:21 when something like really awful happens,
01:53:23 I feel kind of like, like, yeah.
01:53:27 No.
01:53:27 I get what you're saying.
01:53:28 Like, what do you define really bad, did you?
01:53:30 Like a school shooting?
01:53:31 Like 9-11 happened, you were like, yeah.
01:53:34 No, no.
01:53:35 Yeah.
01:53:35 You're quietly to yourself.
01:53:36 Yeah.
01:53:37 I guess more like complex things
01:53:40 that seem like they would happen on TV, you know?
01:53:43 You go like, oh, shit, that's right.
01:53:45 Like, people really are fucking complicated
01:53:47 and weird and crazy.
01:53:48 It's like art really does imitate art.
01:53:49 No, I mean, yeah, there's a whole George Carlin
01:53:52 bit about that where he's like,
01:53:53 I kind of like it when a lot of people die.
01:53:56 And it's like, yeah, yeah, I'm with you, man.
01:53:59 I'm with you 100%.
01:54:01 It's fucking cool and funny when a lot of people die.
01:54:02 Maybe it'll help me articulate this better
01:54:04 because I literally just spring into my mind.
01:54:06 I don't know how to articulate this at all.
01:54:08 And he made that bit and he recorded it for an album
01:54:10 and like the next day, September 11th happened.
01:54:13 Oh my God.
01:54:14 So like it had, that album wasn't released,
01:54:17 but it's hilarious.
01:54:19 I just want to say, by the way,
01:54:21 before we lose sight of the real point of this conversation,
01:54:23 which is dinosaurs being great.
01:54:25 Digi, Digi Dino has been sitting in a cell for years.
01:54:28 Now he's turned into a fossil.
01:54:29 When will you revive him?
01:54:30 Please, please, please, please.
01:54:34 What do you want me to do with Digi Dino?
01:54:36 Please, please.
01:54:38 Have him post meme review or something.
01:54:40 I don't know.
01:54:41 I don't even think I have the files anymore.
01:54:43 That's on like an old computer.
01:54:45 Dude, don't worry, bro.
01:54:47 He's got you covered.
01:54:48 No, I got you, bro.
01:54:49 We're going to get like 50 animations.
01:54:51 I'm always hesitant to use.
01:54:53 I have like some, you know, certain pieces of old munchie
01:54:56 art on my computer.
01:54:57 I'm going to, in fact, post one in the chat
01:54:59 so we can have it in the show notes.
01:55:01 One that I've used it one time for a shitty attempt
01:55:06 at a freestyle that I posted on SoundCloud.
01:55:10 I don't even remember this.
01:55:12 That's the only thing I've ever used it for.
01:55:13 It's this one, the Special Forces Anime Guru Hobo Digi.
01:55:17 Oh, yeah, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember this.
01:55:20 I'm always hesitant to use any old munchie art for anything
01:55:23 because munchie will scream at me about how it's shit art
01:55:26 that he made when he was a baby and he needs to redo it
01:55:30 and replace it every time.
01:55:31 No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:55:32 Okay, Digi, hold on.
01:55:33 I just want to clear my name, by the way,
01:55:35 because I understand why you would think that.
01:55:38 But I just want to like remind you that like things change
01:55:42 and it's been like four years since that this last happened.
01:55:47 That's not true.
01:55:48 I don't know if it's been four years, but maybe two years.
01:55:49 Well, okay, it's been literally four seconds
01:55:53 since Muncie questioned every piece of art
01:55:55 he's ever put pen to paper on and created.
01:55:58 I think old munchie art looks really like grody
01:56:01 for about like a better word.
01:56:01 Like it looks like weird.
01:56:03 If you look at my old like pony art,
01:56:05 it's like a fucking like, it's like a wax museum.
01:56:09 It's like a strange uncanny experience.
01:56:12 But I have no problem with anyone posting it in any context
01:56:14 and I would love it if you were to use
01:56:16 any art of mine ever, Digi.
01:56:17 So I'm just going to use this hobo as my avatar
01:56:20 everywhere from now on forever.
01:56:23 This is the best art of me that exists probably.
01:56:27 But just make sure you realize that you are Asgore
01:56:30 and you were destroying the undertale.
01:56:32 Instead of mercy, it's a good taste just there.
01:56:34 Oh, am I supposed to be Asgore?
01:56:37 What the fuck?
01:56:37 Yeah, yeah.
01:56:38 It's got a trident and a cape, I guess.
01:56:40 Yeah.
01:56:40 I had no hype.
01:56:42 Ever.
01:56:46 Remember Asgore, guys?
01:56:48 Yeah, he's pretty cool.
01:56:49 Best anime ever.
01:56:51 He was daddy.
01:56:52 He was a daddy in a big way.
01:56:53 Yeah, but yeah, see, look at this fucking dinosaur hoax
01:56:56 page I just linked.
01:56:57 I mean, look at how many words are on this page.
01:56:59 It must be true.
01:57:00 And they've written so many words on this map.
01:57:03 Why did they label it themselves as a conspiracy?
01:57:08 No, they labeled it as a conspiracy.
01:57:11 We've got to move to Dinosauria.
01:57:13 When everyone's like, oh, the sea levels are right now, fuck.
01:57:15 I'm fine in Dinosauria.
01:57:16 Guys, the PCP has assigned a single release contract
01:57:21 with Dinosauria.
01:57:22 It's going to be the one-stop shop for the PCP from now on.
01:57:25 Jesse, I think you're going to have to rethink your logic
01:57:28 here, because there's actually not that many words.
01:57:31 If you only go 40% of the other way down the page,
01:57:34 it becomes the comments.
01:57:36 So half of this page is comments,
01:57:38 and also the formatting of the page
01:57:39 is such that there is just one tiny column.
01:57:42 So you're right.
01:57:43 It's mostly comments.
01:57:44 It would be like five paragraphs, and that's it.
01:57:47 You see, that's right, because I form most of my opinions
01:57:49 on 40% of anything.
01:57:52 Makes sense.
01:57:53 That's as much as I care to read.
01:57:55 I just saw this on the page, and I appreciate it immensely.
01:58:02 Make your own.
01:58:03 Make your own.
01:58:04 Make your own.
01:58:06 Full proof instructions for budding paleontologists.
01:58:09 You know that I really wanted to be a paleontologist
01:58:12 when I was a kid?
01:58:13 So did I.
01:58:14 That's a real kid goal.
01:58:15 I wanted to be an astronomer.
01:58:17 Obviously, because of Jurassic Park.
01:58:18 But I had a book called The Big Book of Dinosaurs.
01:58:23 It was like fucking 12,000 pages,
01:58:26 this gigantic phone book of every page
01:58:29 which just had a different dinosaur and a shitload
01:58:31 of facts about them, which had blown my mind,
01:58:34 because there's only 12 dinosaurs anybody talks about,
01:58:36 but this book had like fucking hundreds of dinosaurs in it.
01:58:40 That's pretty sick.
01:58:40 That was more of a space kid.
01:58:42 Honestly, like the planets.
01:58:44 If someone can actually convince me
01:58:48 that dinosaurs never existed, you
01:58:50 will make me depressed for the rest of my life.
01:58:53 Well, I mean, this guy, apparently the guy who
01:58:55 makes this blog, Eric Dubey, I clicked on the link
01:58:58 to see what he is.
01:58:59 I mean, this is in very tiny resolution,
01:59:01 but there's this picture of him in a meditative pose.
01:59:04 He looks so smart.
01:59:05 Oh, crap.
01:59:06 He definitely wasn't in that bed.
01:59:08 He definitely took a picture of himself in a meditative
01:59:10 and then Google search like cool eclectic meditation bedroom
01:59:14 and then Photoshopped himself on top of it.
01:59:16 Yeah, it's a high level, high IQ move.
01:59:17 His blogs, Natural First, Eric's Esoterics, The Atlantean
01:59:22 Conspiracy, the Happy Health Homepage, and Bangkok Wing Chun.
01:59:27 He's a yoga and Wing Chun part time teacher
01:59:31 while exposing the New World Order.
01:59:33 This is his claim about him.
01:59:34 Oh, Hulcogan, Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash.
01:59:36 They're at it again.
01:59:38 The New World Order is always messing shit up for everyone.
01:59:41 I want to give a shout to my, when I was a kid,
01:59:45 I was like, it's weird to think how when I was a kid,
01:59:48 I just believed conspiracy theories
01:59:50 and wasn't even scared about it.
01:59:52 Wasn't even like, placed a lot of emphasis on it.
01:59:54 I was just like, oh, spirit science?
01:59:56 That's probably true.
01:59:57 Oh, just whatever conspiracy, that's just probably true.
02:00:01 That makes sense.
02:00:02 Unironically, love all conspiracy theories.
02:00:05 And I believe a few of them.
02:00:08 OK, wait, I've got a recommendation for Jesse.
02:00:13 Storm Cloud's Gathering.
02:00:14 Storm Cloud's Gathering has some classic Obama conspiracy
02:00:17 videos, just classic.
02:00:20 A lot of World War III predictions
02:00:21 that he says is going to start in 2014.
02:00:24 So I'm excited to see how he's justified it.
02:00:26 It's a very cold war going on, very cold war.
02:00:29 I want to make a channel, just for a separate YouTube channel,
02:00:33 just for talking about conspiracies
02:00:35 and how cool they all are, even the scary ones,
02:00:38 especially the scary ones.
02:00:39 I would be damned for that 100%.
02:00:42 And have it not even attached to me in any way
02:00:45 that anyone can trace back to me.
02:00:47 Because the sad thing is that you can't even
02:00:50 appreciate conspiracy theories, because if you
02:00:52 talk about them at all, people label you something,
02:00:54 or this or that, or think you're an evil idiot asshole.
02:00:58 But it's like, I don't care if it's true or not.
02:01:01 They're just fucking cool.
02:01:03 They're all awesome.
02:01:04 Have you guys ever watched any of that?
02:01:05 Fall down a rabbit hole and finding the evidence,
02:01:08 and finding the connections, and hearing people,
02:01:12 like the experts on them, like the crypto experts and shit.
02:01:15 It's so fun.
02:01:15 It's so cool.
02:01:17 Have you ever watched, before Alex Jones did his radio show,
02:01:20 he made huge documentary movies.
02:01:23 And I've watched all of them, and they're fascinating.
02:01:25 Oh, OK.
02:01:26 If you never had no idea.
02:01:27 You got to watch The Obama Deception.
02:01:29 That's a fucking masterpiece.
02:01:31 What's the gist of that one?
02:01:32 That Obama's a puppet of the New World Order.
02:01:35 And there's a whole thing.
02:01:36 That's definitely true.
02:01:37 Easy.
02:01:38 His first videos where he storms Bohemian Grove
02:01:41 and tries to break into this place where all these rich people
02:01:45 hang out.
02:01:45 That's how you get them.
02:01:47 You start them with stuff that's totally obviously true.
02:01:50 Like, yeah, Obama's a puppet of the New World Order.
02:01:52 So that's how you get into conspiracy.
02:01:54 And then from there, you can slowly get more and more
02:01:56 until you're where dinosaurs weren't real.
02:01:58 Oh, shit.
02:01:59 What?
02:02:00 You know, this first comment by Alex Jones.
02:02:02 It's all about the clockwork elves and the psychic pedophiles.
02:02:06 Oh, you know, the biggest thing he thinks
02:02:08 is, I've seen some of this, the biggest thing he thinks
02:02:11 is that the elites of our world are attempting
02:02:14 to create an interdimensional psychic separation where
02:02:18 they're going to, I think, clone themselves.
02:02:20 It's like literally the plot of Evangelion,
02:02:22 where they're trying to separate themselves
02:02:25 into a higher plane of existence.
02:02:27 I believe that.
02:02:27 In some interdimensional connection thing,
02:02:30 it like leaves the rest of humanity behind or something.
02:02:32 There are very few things Alex Jones has said that I didn't
02:02:34 think.
02:02:35 Yeah, that sounds plausible.
02:02:38 I mean, I have definitely changed the wording a little bit.
02:02:41 It definitely seems reasonable to me
02:02:43 that there are extradimensional beings that have manipulated
02:02:49 and convinced the elite of our society
02:02:51 that by sacrificing children and having blood rituals,
02:02:54 they can ascend to a higher plane of being
02:02:56 by selling humanity's souls, by convincing everybody
02:02:59 that we don't have souls.
02:03:00 What else do you have to do at that point?
02:03:02 You've conquered all of new society at that point.
02:03:05 I've been getting really into the paranormal board
02:03:08 on 4chan, which is like pole times 1,000.
02:03:11 It's like, it's where the really wild stuff happens.
02:03:15 If everyone wants to really pull back the lid,
02:03:18 I recommend the paranormal board on 4chan.
02:03:21 That's the cool shit.
02:03:23 Because all the information is 4chan.
02:03:25 So it's all conveniently put into these little PNG images
02:03:28 and these old graphs.
02:03:28 And you can look at one image and go, oh, shit.
02:03:30 I understand the whole world now.
02:03:31 Everything's fucked and there's no dinosaur as shit.
02:03:34 I didn't realize how conspiratorially driven X was.
02:03:39 But I guess I should start going on there.
02:03:40 I mean, it used to be, years and years ago,
02:03:44 when I first started looking at it and stuff,
02:03:47 it used to be just creepy postures and scary shit
02:03:50 and spooky ghosts and stuff.
02:03:51 And then from there, it turned into a lot of Tulpa shit.
02:03:54 And then from there, somehow that morphed into more New World
02:03:59 order.
02:03:59 I guess because the whole world just got way too political
02:04:01 at a certain point.
02:04:03 Probably around 2016.
02:04:04 So all the scary spooky shit kind of dissipated from X.
02:04:07 And it sort of got more and more into like, hey,
02:04:09 you know these fucking New World order guys
02:04:11 are sacrificing children to alien beings.
02:04:14 Oh, you know what the best part of the 2016 presidential
02:04:17 election was?
02:04:18 Was learning about Hillary Clinton's spirit cooking?
02:04:20 That was legitimately my favorite fucking part,
02:04:22 was learning about spirit cooking,
02:04:24 about all the crazy shit that Hillary Clinton does
02:04:26 and her fucking dance pad orgies with spirit cooking.
02:04:30 What is spirit cooking and why do I keep hearing about it?
02:04:33 Well, it's because it's my favorite thing in the entire world
02:04:35 and I constantly bring it up.
02:04:38 So it's a thing where you take like a mutilated corpse
02:04:42 and then just start eating it and boiling it
02:04:44 and just sort of just fucking around with it in the kitchen.
02:04:47 It makes it a delicious meal, man.
02:04:50 So it's just cannibalistic?
02:04:51 OK, listen to this.
02:04:52 Oh, yeah, yeah.
02:04:52 It doesn't say cannibalistic, too.
02:04:54 That's another big aspect of the police.
02:04:55 Urban Dictionary's goddess covered with this.
02:04:57 OK, spirit cooking, a verb, an action
02:04:59 in which ranking members of the Democratic Party
02:05:02 ejaculate into an open wound on the breast milk soaked
02:05:06 left hand in a quote, art form, similar to that
02:05:09 of watercolor finger paints.
02:05:12 That doesn't explain anything.
02:05:13 No, I don't understand.
02:05:14 That's the only definition on here, by the way.
02:05:16 It doesn't even have anything to do with eating.
02:05:17 I don't know.
02:05:20 I know, first of it is that it's spooky cannibalism,
02:05:23 not normal cannibalism, but just like specifically
02:05:26 is cannibalism meant to scare you?
02:05:28 You know, actually, the time I heard spirit cooking recently.
02:05:31 That's totally OK.
02:05:32 Out of interest, I wanted to hear Alex Jones take
02:05:35 on the whole Epstein thing, who, by the way, was like,
02:05:38 the thing about Alex Jones that's fucked up
02:05:41 is that he seems to spout these wildly ridiculous claims.
02:05:45 And then like 20 years later, he's proved like mostly
02:05:49 correct about some of them.
02:05:50 Like everything that we know as being true in history
02:05:54 was at some point labeled a conspiracy theory.
02:05:57 That's true.
02:05:58 And I'm not saying that Alex Jones is right over time.
02:06:00 I remember reading about Epstein and his island
02:06:03 in like 2009.
02:06:04 Alex Jones was one of the big guys saying
02:06:06 Epstein was up to fuck shit like before anyone else.
02:06:09 Everyone now is taking it as a given.
02:06:10 Like it's like, oh, yeah, that totally happened.
02:06:12 Well, like when people were saying
02:06:13 it was happening eight years ago,
02:06:15 everyone was saying, no, you're a conspiracy buff.
02:06:18 Yeah.
02:06:19 Well, I heard Alex Jones say that specifically
02:06:21 they were doing satanic spirit cooking on Epstein's island.
02:06:25 It always has to be fascinating.
02:06:27 I talk about it in some of my videos for the last year.
02:06:30 So this idea I have of the Otaku hero
02:06:34 and how it's split between a character
02:06:36 that I call the mad scientist and the living computer.
02:06:39 And the mad scientist is somebody
02:06:41 who can make all these connections
02:06:43 and figure out all these things that are happening in the world.
02:06:46 And he understands that they must be true,
02:06:49 but cannot prove it or cannot find a way to convince people.
02:06:53 And the living computer is the extremely logic driven person
02:06:56 who is able to just like take in all this data.
02:07:01 But like they will only believe something
02:07:03 when they have the data in front of them.
02:07:06 And like-
02:07:07 I think there's a third version here,
02:07:08 which is the fuck machine,
02:07:09 which started with Tenchi Muyo back in the day,
02:07:11 which is the original breeder.
02:07:13 Anyway.
02:07:14 But go on.
02:07:15 So like, I think that a mad scientist
02:07:17 will always figure things out before everybody else does,
02:07:20 but nobody's gonna believe it
02:07:21 until the computer has proven it, you know,
02:07:24 until we have the data.
02:07:25 And that's the drama of the series.
02:07:26 It's just funny because like,
02:07:29 wait, the what?
02:07:30 The trauma-
02:07:31 That's the drama, like the drama of the series
02:07:33 is that he knows something,
02:07:34 he's trying to prove it to the rest of the world.
02:07:36 That's just the life story of Johnny Old School.
02:07:39 Yeah, well, I mean, it's the life story of anybody,
02:07:41 like anybody who is capable of recognizing things,
02:07:45 they can't explain, it's just like,
02:07:47 you can talk about it all day,
02:07:48 but nobody's gonna believe it until they see the data.
02:07:51 And like, you know, I think all of us have a few things
02:07:54 that we like, we are fairly confident are true.
02:07:58 And we're like, we're like, I know that
02:08:01 I've seen all the connections, but I don't know how to,
02:08:04 I don't know how to verbalize them,
02:08:06 or like, I don't know where I can pull the evidence from,
02:08:08 or like, I don't have the science to back it,
02:08:10 but it is observably the case, you know?
02:08:13 Most people feel that way, I'm sure.
02:08:14 Yeah, and like, other people will just say,
02:08:16 oh, you say it's observably the case,
02:08:19 but I mean, you know, it could be this other thing.
02:08:22 And it's like, okay, yeah, I guess, it could be that,
02:08:25 but also, this is obviously true, you know?
02:08:28 So it's something like the Epstein thing, it's like,
02:08:30 yeah, unless there was evidence,
02:08:31 no matter how obvious it might've been that it was true,
02:08:35 it's just not going to be believed.
02:08:37 And I mean, when you hear something
02:08:39 that at first sounds completely impossibly insane
02:08:42 and outrageous, like all the millionaires and billionaires
02:08:45 are secretly fucking kids, you know?
02:08:48 But then that turns out to be true?
02:08:50 Well, then why wouldn't you also believe,
02:08:51 oh yeah, also by the way,
02:08:53 the world is run by like satanic cannibals that also,
02:08:56 like, yeah, I believe it, I mean, fuck,
02:08:59 no one believed the kids thing,
02:09:00 but that turned out to be true, fuck it.
02:09:02 I mean, we're just talking about like,
02:09:04 the path of conspiracy, conspiratorial thinking.
02:09:07 I mean, this first comment here by anonymous really,
02:09:10 really spells out how we all feel.
02:09:13 I think he goes,
02:09:14 dude, my brain can't handle another lid
02:09:17 being blown off the lie machine.
02:09:19 First I find they messed with the shape of the earth,
02:09:24 set up a military industrial complex like space agency,
02:09:28 and now all the dinosaur bones shoved in my face
02:09:30 since I was a child as a hoax too, my heart is broken.
02:09:34 I have been lied to on so many levels my whole life.
02:09:37 Why?
02:09:37 The only thing that makes the most sense
02:09:39 is their fear of God and his power to make or break creation.
02:09:42 If anything, it proves more and more
02:09:45 we have been warned in the Bible
02:09:46 that the enemy is the father of lies.
02:09:49 What's next?
02:09:50 Radical Islam is the pure religion
02:09:52 and the sheep will run to it.
02:09:54 So sad.
02:09:56 I'm so sad.
02:09:56 I'm with you anonymous.
02:09:57 What's this about late jazz?
02:09:59 Yeah, written by my alter ego, anonymous.
02:10:03 What does he mean they fucked with the shape of the earth?
02:10:05 He's talking about flat earth shit, clearly.
02:10:07 He's clearly, you know.
02:10:09 They unflattened the earth.
02:10:11 Like the earth was flat, but these fucking globalists.
02:10:14 That's why they're called the globalists.
02:10:17 Yeah, the parentheses, parentheses, parentheses,
02:10:20 globalists took that flat earth and wrapped it into a ball
02:10:23 just to fuck with all of us.
02:10:24 So they could hold it in their hands
02:10:25 as they power over everything.
02:10:26 The deepest conspiracy of all,
02:10:27 to turn the world into a globe.
02:10:31 They did it.
02:10:32 They did it, those monsters.
02:10:34 Who's got any more spell side?
02:10:35 We can't top this.
02:10:38 Peace of the HQ ice wall.
02:10:40 We should do it at the ice wall.
02:10:43 Radcon five, atop the ice wall.
02:10:47 We threw the earth this flat at Radcon five.
02:10:51 That's the big vlog.
02:10:52 That's the big vlog, on air.
02:10:55 Let's go to voicemail's people.
02:10:57 Link below, speak pipe, leave us voicemails.
02:11:00 You know the drill people.
02:11:01 We will play the good ones.
02:11:02 We got like six, I think.
02:11:04 Okay, first one.
02:11:05 This is from, I think it's a misspelled rusty shackle
02:11:08 for it, but I think that's the idea was going for.
02:11:10 And he's apparently got a big problem.
02:11:12 So let's see what he's got for us.
02:11:14 Go.
02:11:15 All right, PCP, I got a big fucking problem for you.
02:11:18 I just recently moved into college.
02:11:19 And you know, my dorm mates, they're pretty cool guys.
02:11:21 You know, no problems there.
02:11:23 The big problem is I can't fucking have time
02:11:25 to jack off here.
02:11:27 There's no fucking privacy.
02:11:28 There's always somebody in the dorm
02:11:31 that would hear me do it.
02:11:32 And I just, I just need to do it.
02:11:35 I need to jack off.
02:11:37 Please, please tell me how I can find time to jack off.
02:11:40 I got it.
02:11:41 I know the answer.
02:11:42 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:11:43 That's definitely you problem.
02:11:45 You got it.
02:11:45 Get a girlfriend, bro.
02:11:47 Get a girlfriend.
02:11:48 And here's why.
02:11:49 People will leave you alone with your girlfriend
02:11:50 thinking you're going to have sex there,
02:11:51 but then you can jack off.
02:11:53 That's not a bad strategy, but I also think, look,
02:11:58 I've shared rooms with people many times.
02:12:01 I've gotten away with jacking off nightly
02:12:03 with other people in the room.
02:12:04 All you got to do is build on the edge of your bed,
02:12:09 just put like a fuckload of blankets and pillows.
02:12:12 Just like build a fort, essentially,
02:12:14 like a wall of like, I used to have,
02:12:17 I shared my room with two other guys.
02:12:19 I had a big, just like one half of my bed.
02:12:22 I just had like all of my pillows and blankets
02:12:24 just stacked on that side of the bed.
02:12:26 So you could not see.
02:12:28 I mean, I don't know if there's a reason
02:12:30 that you're jacking off is loud,
02:12:32 but I mean, all you need is to not be seen, right?
02:12:35 Digi, I don't know if you're on the bottom bunk
02:12:38 of a bunk bed, that's probably pretty difficult.
02:12:40 I mean, put up a sheet, just put a cover around your bed,
02:12:44 like just staple a sheet around the bed.
02:12:48 I think it's generally considered socially uncouth
02:12:51 to do it with other guys in the room.
02:12:52 I'm not going to pretend like.
02:12:54 I don't care about the socially uncouth.
02:12:55 You have to jack off.
02:12:57 You can't just not jack off.
02:12:59 I'm not going to pretend.
02:13:00 I haven't in emergency situations
02:13:03 jacked off with other guys in the room.
02:13:05 I certainly have, as I think most God fearing Americans
02:13:07 have expressed to do.
02:13:08 I mean, if you have to share a room with other guys,
02:13:11 it's like you're either sacrificing jacking off forever
02:13:14 or you're jacking off in a room with other guys.
02:13:16 You could just go do it in the bathroom.
02:13:18 Yeah, that's the obvious choice.
02:13:20 Like I don't understand why it's even a question of like,
02:13:22 you have to do it in the room.
02:13:25 Some of us don't like to hide our,
02:13:27 we don't like to build a wall of shame between us.
02:13:31 Some people like to sit in an office chair like a man,
02:13:33 pull down our pants and go to town
02:13:35 on a big wide computer screen with some sound at maximum
02:13:39 so everyone can hear what I'm doing.
02:13:41 Yeah, what does this mean?
02:13:44 That jacking off can be quiet.
02:13:45 I don't believe you.
02:13:47 You can improve your hygiene as well.
02:13:49 You can just go take a shower
02:13:50 whenever you want to jack off.
02:13:52 That's a lot of noise.
02:13:54 Kill two birds with one stone.
02:13:55 What produces noise?
02:13:56 I personally, I like to jack off when I go to bed.
02:14:00 Like it helps me get to sleep.
02:14:03 As I think Jesse once said,
02:14:05 it's the only activity that can wake you up
02:14:07 in the morning and put you to bed at night.
02:14:10 Sure.
02:14:11 I don't remember saying that, but it's funny.
02:14:12 So I'll take credit for it.
02:14:14 I think you said that.
02:14:15 But yeah, it's, you know, I can't,
02:14:19 I have like a pevlavian response.
02:14:20 Like the second I lay down in bed, I get an erection.
02:14:23 So I have to do something about it.
02:14:26 Shit.
02:14:26 Look, I know exactly how this guy is.
02:14:28 I hate it.
02:14:29 I can't stand it.
02:14:29 It's unfortunate.
02:14:30 And the second I see a woman, it's gone.
02:14:34 I remember this exact problem.
02:14:35 When I was in college, I shared rooms and stuff.
02:14:37 I remember like, I should have been like, sure.
02:14:39 I remember I had my PSP,
02:14:41 because this was like before we had, I had a smartphone.
02:14:44 I'd bring my PSP with the like four porn tracks
02:14:46 that I had loaded onto there.
02:14:48 I would trundle my fat ass down to the bathroom
02:14:50 and jerk off a few into the turlet.
02:14:53 And it was horrible.
02:14:54 And it was shameful.
02:14:55 And it was terrible.
02:14:56 Like, you know, like to watch porn.
02:14:58 Checking up in a bathroom is not that comfortable.
02:15:00 Like, if you-
02:15:00 No, it's not.
02:15:01 I agree.
02:15:02 Try it.
02:15:03 I mean, even in the shower, like you-
02:15:04 I would feel so, I mean, it would feel uncomfortable
02:15:06 doing it with like, you're in the bed.
02:15:08 There's another guy in like the bed
02:15:09 across the room or whatever.
02:15:11 And you'd be like, I don't know,
02:15:12 doesn't it take you out to be like,
02:15:13 oh, what if he hears me?
02:15:14 Oh, what if he sees the vibrations or whatever?
02:15:16 It's just fucking good enough system that they can't.
02:15:18 Like, again, if you're on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed,
02:15:20 just put literally staple a fucking blanket
02:15:24 or something around your bed and just have a sheet.
02:15:27 Notice how we're offering no real solutions to his problem.
02:15:30 What do you mean?
02:15:30 We're telling him like, this is,
02:15:31 that's not a solution, did you?
02:15:33 That's not a solution.
02:15:33 How is that not a, wait.
02:15:34 He asked, how do I get away with jacking off
02:15:37 with other people in the room?
02:15:38 I'm talking about a permanent-
02:15:40 Okay.
02:15:41 Put a sheet around your bed forever.
02:15:43 Don't just do it when you jack off.
02:15:44 Just put it around for privacy purposes.
02:15:46 Yeah, okay, okay.
02:15:47 Because then you could have a fucking fort you live in.
02:15:49 Like it's, first of all,
02:15:50 I would do this even if it wasn't for jacking off.
02:15:52 Just pretend.
02:15:53 Just pretend that you're retarded.
02:15:55 And then you can do it in front of people.
02:15:56 Hold hands with your bro while you're sleeping.
02:15:58 And, you know, like, good God-fearing Americans.
02:16:00 Yeah, I mean, if you're gonna have to do it secretly
02:16:02 with other guys in the room,
02:16:02 you might as well just do it openly
02:16:04 with other guys in the room.
02:16:05 You might as well all jack off together.
02:16:06 You might as well just all be gay.
02:16:09 You might as well just be boyfriends with your boys.
02:16:12 This method is tested and proven by me.
02:16:15 It works.
02:16:15 Build a fort of blankets.
02:16:17 Jack off quietly.
02:16:20 Whatever happened to hiding a bunch of playboys
02:16:22 in a tree stump in the woods?
02:16:24 Whatever happened to that?
02:16:25 I mean, that works too.
02:16:25 Back when I grew up in the 1970s, that's what we did.
02:16:30 Beep, beep.
02:16:31 Solid play?
02:16:31 Just, yeah, jacking off in the woods
02:16:32 is also a good option.
02:16:34 In the woods, in the woods.
02:16:36 Good, good, also.
02:16:37 Yeah, in the 100 acre wood.
02:16:40 That's where Christopher went.
02:16:42 The only problem with jacking off in the woods
02:16:43 is A, in the winter, cold.
02:16:45 B, bugs, grunts.
02:16:47 Winter's coming, winter's coming.
02:16:49 I think that's what the Starks were talking about.
02:16:50 You know, we saw the Christopher Robin movie
02:16:52 where he's old and he's reconnecting with Poo.
02:16:55 I wanna see the middle school era, Winnie the Pooh movie,
02:16:58 where Christopher Robin, all of his friends
02:17:00 wanna hang out with him in the 100 acre woods,
02:17:02 but he's like, I just came in here to jack off, Poo.
02:17:04 Leave me alone, god damn.
02:17:05 Oh my god.
02:17:06 This reminds me of, this was probably the most,
02:17:08 it was that exact scenario you just described,
02:17:10 but it was of Andy in Toy Story.
02:17:12 It was a robot chicken skit.
02:17:15 And it was that he became a teenager
02:17:16 and was like, oh god, this makes me actually wanna cry.
02:17:18 It was Buzz Lightyear.
02:17:21 And he's like, oh shit, we don't have a bong.
02:17:23 This'll do.
02:17:24 And they grab him, they like stick a straw into his brain
02:17:26 and then they're like, use him as a bong.
02:17:28 And then they put him back and Buzz like,
02:17:30 oh, what happened guys, are we going to play today?
02:17:32 And he's like, it's okay, Buzz, it's okay, you're gonna make.
02:17:35 I wanna actually cry thinking about
02:17:37 how he fucked up Buzz Lightyear
02:17:39 and made him literally retarded.
02:17:40 It's not, how could you do that robot chicken?
02:17:43 You went too far.
02:17:45 Let's do another voicemail before I burst into tears.
02:17:48 Hey P, he probably filmed himself coming all over
02:17:50 with Bo Peep a few times and posted it on 4chan.
02:17:54 Most people do.
02:17:55 That's just part of growing up.
02:17:56 Okay, next voicemail is unhuman core.
02:18:00 And if I remember correctly,
02:18:00 I think this guy was kind of hard to understand.
02:18:02 So, so pay attention.
02:18:04 So you picked it.
02:18:05 Great.
02:18:05 Okay, yes, it's good.
02:18:08 So let's just go with the term
02:18:10 trying to come up with the definition of human core,
02:18:12 you guys.
02:18:14 It was like,
02:18:15 I came to a conclusion about the most unhuman core thing
02:18:18 I ever did.
02:18:19 And I think it might help you guys
02:18:22 because the second opposite of human core,
02:18:24 monster core, demon core.
02:18:26 Okay.
02:18:27 I think I ever did.
02:18:27 So, I went to the movies with this show,
02:18:31 my grandma bought to me,
02:18:33 it was a floral pattern.
02:18:35 Got me looking pretty gay.
02:18:37 So when I got inside the movie theater with my boys,
02:18:41 I decided to bring up the scene from the Simpsons.
02:18:44 I don't know if you ever saw that episode,
02:18:46 the best fucking episode.
02:18:48 And when they meet John Waters,
02:18:51 they meet a gay man,
02:18:53 and they get paranoid that Bach might be gay.
02:18:56 And Bach comes like walking,
02:19:00 like a little faggot with fucking flowers.
02:19:02 So I got up on my seat to imitate that scene.
02:19:06 I accidentally kicked my fucking popcorn on the floor.
02:19:11 And my friends started laughing at me.
02:19:14 I fucking ate the fucking popcorn
02:19:17 right out of the fucking floor,
02:19:19 looking straight into the fucking night.
02:19:21 So they don't fucking know me.
02:19:25 I am a slave to society.
02:19:27 I don't live in a society.
02:19:30 I am the guy from Seven,
02:19:32 I am the Joker, and I am a demon.
02:19:37 So that's his demon's core story.
02:19:39 That's the most demon core.
02:19:40 Demon core is eating your movie popcorn off
02:19:43 while staring at your friends in the eyes.
02:19:44 After you kick it off your lap,
02:19:47 because you're laughing so hard
02:19:49 at the scene where Bart's cross-dressing
02:19:51 in the John Waters episode of The Simpsons.
02:19:53 Yes.
02:19:54 That is a very demon core.
02:19:56 Yeah, I understand.
02:19:57 But he, some, he just,
02:19:58 I understand none of it.
02:19:59 He's watching The Simpsons on his phone
02:20:01 in the movie theater.
02:20:02 He made me misunderstand,
02:20:03 he didn't, I think his friends maliciously
02:20:05 to make fun of him,
02:20:06 and that's why he's defiantly eating the popcorn
02:20:08 on the ground.
02:20:09 Oh, you think so?
02:20:10 That's why he said that you don't own me.
02:20:11 That's why he's saying,
02:20:12 he's looking in the,
02:20:13 I mean, it's fucking honestly,
02:20:15 like we're all trying to interpret,
02:20:16 because I could,
02:20:17 it was all of my mental ability
02:20:19 to understand that guy.
02:20:20 What's fucking accent?
02:20:21 That was like a fast Andre the Giant.
02:20:27 Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.
02:20:33 All right, well, that mystery behind us.
02:20:34 Something South American?
02:20:36 I don't know.
02:20:36 Yeah, I don't know.
02:20:37 Just tell me where you're from on human core.
02:20:40 Okay, next up,
02:20:41 Stalin's ghost is calling in.
02:20:43 All right, let's do it, go.
02:20:45 Hello, this is Stalin's ghost.
02:20:49 Yes, God, this is he,
02:20:51 Stalin, recording from hell,
02:20:54 where all the fucking people call me scum,
02:20:57 go when they die.
02:20:59 Okay, sure.
02:21:00 I have message for Mr. Nate Biestum,
02:21:04 just a little something that's been on my mind
02:21:07 for quite a while.
02:21:09 And I just needed to cool about it
02:21:12 to set the record straight.
02:21:14 And by straight, I mean, fuck you, Nate.
02:21:20 Multiple fucking times on the podcast.
02:21:24 Nate's best guy ever,
02:21:26 has referred to highly civilized
02:21:29 and ancient practice of programming
02:21:31 as motherfucking coding.
02:21:34 And I'm just wanting to say, Nate,
02:21:37 my dude gave some fucking self-respect.
02:21:42 I don't blame Tom or Manchi.
02:21:45 They're just little busy babies
02:21:48 that haven't gone to school to learn this sheet.
02:21:52 Be advised, Nate Biestum,
02:21:55 you are on notice and we are watching
02:22:00 you for further infractions.
02:22:02 Slava Rodinia.
02:22:04 Is coding like a disrespectful way
02:22:08 to refer to programming or something?
02:22:10 They're just different.
02:22:11 Well, they're not the same thing, are they, aren't they?
02:22:12 Coding means creating codes from one language to another.
02:22:16 Programming means to program a machine
02:22:18 to perform a certain set of instructions.
02:22:22 But you write code to program, right?
02:22:24 I have no idea.
02:22:26 I have no clue.
02:22:28 It sounds like some semantic bull.
02:22:30 It does.
02:22:31 It definitely is.
02:22:31 Is that guy's fake accent sound like Manmode's real accent?
02:22:36 A little bit.
02:22:36 A little bit.
02:22:37 Is he Russian?
02:22:38 Is he Ukrainian, right?
02:22:39 He sounded a little bit Wisconsin.
02:22:41 A little bit of Wisconsin in there.
02:22:42 That might have been bleeding through.
02:22:43 Oh, don't you know.
02:22:45 Maybe Stalin escaped Russia
02:22:47 and is living in Wisconsin this very day.
02:22:49 That's my, well, he is actually Stalin's ghost
02:22:52 and he did say was calling him from hell.
02:22:54 So, okay, I guess nevermind on that one.
02:22:56 Okay, moving on.
02:22:57 Quarren, Quarren, I guess is calling in.
02:23:01 Okay, great.
02:23:02 Go.
02:23:03 All right, listen up you Judsters.
02:23:05 Watching Radcon 3 content
02:23:07 was some of the best fucking shit I've ever seen on YouTube.
02:23:10 Nice.
02:23:11 Now, I won't say that I'll be able to provide
02:23:15 every single cent that is needed to fund Radcon 4,
02:23:18 where I will remind you,
02:23:19 Muggie is now fully legal and fully fuckable.
02:23:23 So, Muggie is totally possible.
02:23:26 Not gonna lie.
02:23:28 But,
02:23:28 Not gonna lie.
02:23:29 But, if you were to have an upward limit
02:23:34 of like imagination of how much
02:23:38 Radcon would require financially,
02:23:40 what would that be?
02:23:42 And,
02:23:44 how much gay sex would be provided?
02:23:47 Thanks, bye.
02:23:48 Is this guy like a billionaire investor or something?
02:23:50 He's our angel investor.
02:23:52 He's a hundred-air investor
02:23:55 and has a few hundred dollars to flip around.
02:23:58 Hey, Radcon 4 plans have been started.
02:24:02 They've been discussed.
02:24:03 To be floated around.
02:24:04 We're probably gonna try to do it.
02:24:08 Probably, we'll probably just request this
02:24:09 like around the same amount of money
02:24:11 because that seems like reasonably what we can get.
02:24:15 But like, you know, we'll promote it more.
02:24:17 We'll probably keep our costs a little lower
02:24:19 because we literally run over budget
02:24:21 on all of these so far.
02:24:22 So like, we're gonna try to make sure
02:24:25 everybody actually gets paid this time.
02:24:26 So, if you're asking what the absolute most
02:24:30 that we would ask for is,
02:24:32 it would be infinite.
02:24:33 Like, we want as much money as possible
02:24:35 to do the thing, obviously.
02:24:36 I can't see us going above our last.
02:24:38 We did $9,001.
02:24:40 That's gotta be, like, I can't possibly see us asking
02:24:43 for even that much.
02:24:44 Is it literally $9,001?
02:24:45 I mean, that was the joke for T-Bat Resurrection.
02:24:47 Right, but how much do we actually make?
02:24:48 Like, should we even?
02:24:49 Like, $9,185.
02:24:50 It was in the 9,000.
02:24:52 I remember the meme number, I think it was 9,185,
02:24:54 I believe.
02:24:55 I think we're probably,
02:24:57 we did a pretty good job with three
02:24:59 of like not over-promising too much.
02:25:01 Like, keeping it reasonably to stuff we knew we could do
02:25:03 and then having a lot of time to do other shit.
02:25:06 So like, we'll probably use a similar tactic next time
02:25:08 of like, you know, there'll be a few core things
02:25:10 that'll be, but like, you know,
02:25:13 there are ways that we can make it
02:25:14 so it might be more worthwhile to pay more
02:25:18 or that just, you know,
02:25:22 yeah, again though, I think the focus this time
02:25:24 is gonna be on like, keeping the cost lower
02:25:26 and making sure everybody gets paid.
02:25:28 And I think like, yeah,
02:25:29 getting paid is part of the equation,
02:25:31 but like, one of the things was like,
02:25:32 for example, with T-Bat Resurrection,
02:25:34 like with all the, the shipping and everything
02:25:36 ate up so much more money than we thought it was going to,
02:25:39 that like, I think Ben and I, I think we made like,
02:25:43 I made $0, I definitely lost money.
02:25:45 I think we made like $1 for doing all the T-Bat Resurrection.
02:25:50 Because of the fact that I got a hotel
02:25:52 so that May could come with me to Boston,
02:25:54 it was like a huge deficit for me.
02:25:57 Yeah, it's understandable.
02:25:58 I mean, oh, it's almost like we provided a place
02:26:00 to stay for you and you chose not to use it,
02:26:01 but yeah, fair enough.
02:26:02 You know, you provided a place for me to stay
02:26:04 and I don't travel alone.
02:26:07 That's true, that's true.
02:26:09 All right, well, whatever.
02:26:10 There you go, people, there's some information.
02:26:12 We'll get back to you, we'll let you know what's going on.
02:26:15 Radcon 4, for me, it's gonna be all,
02:26:18 it's gonna be all lectures.
02:26:20 It's just gonna, that's my goal for Radcon 4
02:26:23 is crank out like at least two, at least two new lectures,
02:26:27 maybe more.
02:26:28 Can you tell us, like, let's get people hype right away
02:26:31 and what kind of lectures you got in mind,
02:26:32 if there's any.
02:26:33 If you want to.
02:26:34 Well, I know for sure I will do a Sonichu 102.
02:26:38 Excellent, finally a 102 course.
02:26:40 I will definitely do a follow up to the Christian lecture.
02:26:46 I had another idea to do one about the Digi Clips.
02:26:49 Right, yeah, John, I really want that one.
02:26:52 Is that the cult of the real digital believers?
02:26:56 It sounds great.
02:26:57 Like, I have scrubbed the old sources
02:26:59 and like all the archives of the forums have been deleted
02:27:03 so it would be, it would, it would probably be short.
02:27:06 Ladies and gentlemen, if you.
02:27:07 There's just not that much out there.
02:27:09 If I had a chance, our listeners have any info on that
02:27:12 that would be of use, please let us know in the comments.
02:27:15 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:27:15 That would actually be, you know, very helpful.
02:27:17 Anyone's got resources about like, yeah,
02:27:20 the Digi Clips and the real digital believer
02:27:22 or the real Digimon believers.
02:27:23 Ben was in there deep.
02:27:24 It's just that all the forums like got cleared
02:27:26 or something right.
02:27:26 When it was being raided by something awful,
02:27:29 I was in there like watching the chaos
02:27:31 and now like the archives don't exist.
02:27:33 That's fucked up.
02:27:34 Jesse.
02:27:35 Have you tried like the way back machine or anything?
02:27:37 I have, yes, I had no, very little luck with that.
02:27:40 Jesse, if you were to come to Radcon 4,
02:27:43 I want, I really want an insane clown posse lecture.
02:27:48 Yeah.
02:27:49 That's the one that I probably would do
02:27:50 that I've been thinking about.
02:27:52 I don't know why I haven't done a lecture yet.
02:27:54 Cause, well, I know why.
02:27:55 It's cause I detest planning for anything
02:27:58 and I like to show up on the, at the last minute,
02:28:00 two days into it and be like,
02:28:02 I don't know what the fuck I'm here
02:28:03 and just go with whatever happens.
02:28:05 And I mean, like the idea of like planning
02:28:07 and getting a whiteboard and drawing stuff on.
02:28:09 I was like, ah.
02:28:10 Oh, it's fucking easy.
02:28:11 We just bullshitted them as we went along.
02:28:14 I don't know about you guys.
02:28:15 I spent like two whole days before my like,
02:28:18 like planning it out and making notes
02:28:20 and like arranging things on like a whiteboard
02:28:22 and like, like putting thumbtacks and things
02:28:24 and putting red stuff.
02:28:25 What do I look like to use a guy who's not lazy?
02:28:30 For the Kingdom Hearts one,
02:28:31 I literally did zero preparation.
02:28:33 I'll be honest, like I've,
02:28:34 I had wanted to do a co-heating Cambria one
02:28:38 and I still might,
02:28:38 but like there is a lot of research
02:28:40 I would have to do in terms of just like reading
02:28:42 all the comics and like tie-in novels
02:28:44 and all that bullshit, which is a little gay.
02:28:48 And also it occurred to me that like,
02:28:50 it'll be a weird lecture to give to a bunch of people
02:28:52 who don't really know the music.
02:28:54 Cause like a big part of the intrigue as a fan is like,
02:28:58 oh wow, that song is about this.
02:29:01 That's crazy.
02:29:02 But the story is not the last one to talk about.
02:29:06 I don't know if I said this on a podcast before,
02:29:08 but the, the, the law, okay.
02:29:10 After the time skip
02:29:11 and after like Chris's transition and everything,
02:29:14 there comes a point in Sonichu
02:29:16 where the lore becomes completely insane.
02:29:19 And it is, it goes,
02:29:21 like the comic basically just completely breaks down
02:29:23 and there's so much shit that is like canonically occurring
02:29:27 that it just has to happen in like text dump and montage,
02:29:30 but it's in there.
02:29:31 It's canon.
02:29:32 Fascinating.
02:29:33 And it, it's, it's, and it just all comes in at once.
02:29:36 And it just completely muddies the waters
02:29:37 of what's, what the deal is.
02:29:39 And it, it needs, it needs a lecture.
02:29:41 Well, fantastic.
02:29:42 That's great.
02:29:42 That's great.
02:29:43 Is he still like, oh, never mind, never mind.
02:29:46 I could do like an ICP one.
02:29:47 Is he still making comics?
02:29:48 Yes.
02:29:49 Slowly.
02:29:49 I could do an Incinclon Posse one.
02:29:51 And I could also,
02:29:52 I could definitely feasibly do like a wrestling one.
02:29:55 I just don't know like the angle I would approach that from
02:29:58 to really encompass like-
02:29:59 That's a huge topic.
02:29:59 Yeah.
02:30:00 Like what's his face?
02:30:01 Max Landis with just his, uh, what's that?
02:30:03 Well, who's the one?
02:30:04 Yeah, it's all, yeah.
02:30:05 It's all just about triple H.
02:30:07 That's not wrestling.
02:30:09 You know what?
02:30:10 It would be the most entertaining to me.
02:30:12 Jesse would just be like,
02:30:14 like the whole history in as brief as possible.
02:30:18 Of wrestling?
02:30:19 Like of the company?
02:30:20 No, of just all, like anything currently relevant,
02:30:23 you know, like any, anything that has affected the way things
02:30:26 are now, like getting you caught up to speed kind of like-
02:30:30 Like the current wrestling landscape?
02:30:32 Like if you wanted to get into wrestling and just tune in
02:30:36 to- How to get into wrestling?
02:30:37 That actually would be pretty useful.
02:30:38 Yeah, that would work.
02:30:39 Yeah.
02:30:39 Cause I'd kind of like something like that.
02:30:41 So I could be up on shit.
02:30:43 Or I could just do an entire lecture all about the repo man.
02:30:49 That sounds great.
02:30:49 The greatest wrestler of all time.
02:30:51 He was a guy with like a hamburger mask and a rope
02:30:55 and he would go around and he would repossess people's shit.
02:30:57 He'd repossess your car.
02:30:59 And the only way to stop him from repossessing your stuff
02:31:02 is to beat him in a wrestling match.
02:31:04 You-
02:31:05 He's a real guy.
02:31:06 Just with these one, this one mention,
02:31:09 I think you've created a demand, a searing massive demand.
02:31:14 And at very least at me, if no one else,
02:31:17 I want to know the full tale of the repo man now.
02:31:20 I mean, that's pretty much it.
02:31:21 That's the full tale of a red bear.
02:31:23 Oh, that was a great lecture.
02:31:24 Thanks.
02:31:25 Hey, you know what?
02:31:26 Also, here's an idea.
02:31:29 A lot of us know a lot of things that we've talked about
02:31:31 and we don't remember what those things are.
02:31:33 So if anybody else remembers something
02:31:35 that you think we should do a lecture on
02:31:37 because you think we could, let me know.
02:31:39 That's fair.
02:31:39 Yeah, why not?
02:31:40 Yeah, what do you want?
02:31:41 What do you want me to do a lecture on?
02:31:42 I'm open to suggestions.
02:31:43 I've said it before, I'll say it again.
02:31:45 I do plan on doing anamorphs for the next lecture.
02:31:47 Yes, indeed.
02:31:48 Oh, that's a great idea.
02:31:50 Dude, that's great.
02:31:50 I'm the target audience for that.
02:31:53 I'm ready.
02:31:54 It's going to be good.
02:31:56 I'm going to throw out a number though.
02:31:57 Just to answer the question at the beginning,
02:31:58 like how much, here's my guess.
02:32:00 I bet if we are able to raise $5,000
02:32:04 as some kind of minimum, I'm sure
02:32:05 that's like a good target for us to start with.
02:32:08 But okay, whatever.
02:32:09 That's totally made up.
02:32:10 We'll see if that pans out.
02:32:11 I bet we could get more.
02:32:15 Like I bet we could.
02:32:16 Oh, I bet we could.
02:32:17 That was the final number that was bigger than us.
02:32:18 I'm just saying.
02:32:19 Like the goal of the Kickstarter
02:32:21 should ultimately be higher than the last one was
02:32:25 because the last one had stretch goals
02:32:27 that went all the way to 9,000.
02:32:28 But the initial goal should be higher
02:32:31 and then should have stretch goals
02:32:33 that go higher than that.
02:32:35 But I would like us to make more money for the next one,
02:32:38 not because I think we should raise the cost of it,
02:32:40 but just because again, we have gone over budget every time.
02:32:43 I still have all the fucking uncreated blue rays
02:32:48 sitting in a box in my closet
02:32:50 that I can't afford to do it.
02:32:53 I don't really, yeah.
02:32:54 Wait, Redcomb blue rays?
02:32:56 Redcomb two blue rays,
02:32:58 the Pleven the Weave blue rays that me and Jesse signed.
02:33:01 We signed like a hundred cases
02:33:04 and I have a hundred cases
02:33:05 and a hundred fucking discs blank sitting in my closet.
02:33:11 Okay, the Pleven the Weave,
02:33:12 that wasn't a Radcon Kickstarter.
02:33:14 I mean, Pleven the Weave wasn't at all.
02:33:16 It was.
02:33:17 I mean, it created,
02:33:18 Redcomb two was paid for
02:33:20 by the Pleven the Weave Kickstarter,
02:33:21 but it was me and it was really my Kickstarter
02:33:25 that I had broke Jesse into.
02:33:28 Yeah.
02:33:29 Was it really paid for?
02:33:29 Did we get really immersed in anything?
02:33:31 Well, everybody's flight was paid for by it.
02:33:33 Yeah, but there was a stretch goal for that.
02:33:35 Every stretch goal of the Kickstarter was somebody's flight.
02:33:38 Oh, because of the guests' appearances.
02:33:42 That's right, that's right.
02:33:43 The idea of it was supposed to be that,
02:33:46 because when we did the first Radcon,
02:33:48 we were all like, oh, we could do this every year
02:33:52 like we were going to Bronycon,
02:33:54 or because we could all afford to meet up once a year.
02:33:57 We were like, let's meet up more often.
02:34:00 Let's try to do a Kickstarter-backed one
02:34:02 so that we can meet up sooner.
02:34:04 And so it was just a few months later
02:34:08 and just the Kickstarter was a huge success.
02:34:09 So we were like, oh yeah, let's fucking do it.
02:34:11 And then once there was a Kickstarter involved,
02:34:14 there were backer rewards and ways to go over budget
02:34:17 and suddenly it was a different kind of animal, you know?
02:34:21 You gotta get those Blu-rays out, dude.
02:34:23 I can't afford it, he's still waiting for his.
02:34:25 I cannot afford to, but first of all.
02:34:27 What do you need to afford it?
02:34:28 Like what's stopping you?
02:34:30 Is it the shipping costs?
02:34:32 Shipping costs, and I, okay.
02:34:34 I have to get art made, I have to actually print.
02:34:37 I do not have a Blu-ray burner, so.
02:34:39 That's not probably not too expensive anymore.
02:34:43 Probably.
02:34:43 I mean, at this point, you might as well wait
02:34:45 because you originally,
02:34:47 your original thing on the Kickstarter
02:34:49 was to do two more seasons of it.
02:34:51 Two seasons, right.
02:34:52 And we still have it made the second season.
02:34:53 We did season two.
02:34:54 I think that's not really gonna happen though.
02:34:55 I mean, let's be real here.
02:34:56 It could, I mean, me and Jesse made four episodes
02:34:58 of a season two.
02:34:59 I think that they are being cost.
02:35:00 Okay, we made season two and it took forever,
02:35:04 but I was really happy with how it turned out.
02:35:06 And I thought like, at the time I thought like,
02:35:08 should there be more?
02:35:08 I don't know, this seems like a good way to end it and stuff.
02:35:11 But Digi came over to my house in like the summer of 2017.
02:35:17 And we recorded four episodes in the furnace room.
02:35:22 Which I don't know, they just,
02:35:25 without Vic being there to film it,
02:35:27 I thought it looked shitty.
02:35:28 It looked really bad.
02:35:29 It didn't look, yeah, on par with like what we had.
02:35:34 I didn't wanna go back in terms of quality.
02:35:36 So I don't think the show can really be done without Vic.
02:35:40 If we do a season three,
02:35:42 I mean, I've sort of like been taking notes
02:35:45 and like writing down episode ideas every once in a while.
02:35:49 So I've got about like,
02:35:51 10 or so ideas for episodes of it.
02:35:53 So we could do-
02:35:54 Well, you know we should have just another season.
02:35:55 And instead of like,
02:35:58 like I don't know what to do about those four that we filmed.
02:36:01 And maybe I could just release those four episodes
02:36:04 as season three.
02:36:05 And season three can be crappy and short,
02:36:07 like my little pony season three.
02:36:09 And then we can do season four the next time or whatever.
02:36:14 We should have a Radcon four stretch goal.
02:36:16 Digi actually releases the DVD.
02:36:20 If we wanted to do that, I could.
02:36:21 But like, yeah, I mean,
02:36:23 this is what happens with a lot of Kickstarter's
02:36:25 is that they are like, as soon as you start,
02:36:29 the number one thing-
02:36:30 Not Radcon three, baby.
02:36:31 We did it.
02:36:32 Yeah, well, you win, ladies and gentlemen.
02:36:33 I mean, we did go over budget for Radcon three.
02:36:35 Like the number one-
02:36:36 I mean, we lost money,
02:36:37 but that means we got the moral victory.
02:36:38 And I'm okay with that.
02:36:39 Yeah, well, that's right.
02:36:40 That's right.
02:36:41 The biggest thing that goes wrong with Kickstarter's
02:36:43 is that every time you add in a new thing,
02:36:46 it increases the cost of everything else in kind.
02:36:49 So it's like, I stretch goals, fly a person out.
02:36:54 Okay.
02:36:55 Well, that's like another trip to the airport.
02:36:57 Another person who has to be,
02:37:00 basically taken care of for the time they're there,
02:37:03 like drive around, make sure they get their food.
02:37:05 Like they have to now spend money
02:37:08 more than they would living at home
02:37:09 because they're eating out all the time
02:37:11 with their friends and like all this shit.
02:37:12 Like all that cost doesn't get factored in
02:37:15 when we make the Kickstarter goals.
02:37:17 Crowdfunding is bad.
02:37:18 I don't believe it.
02:37:19 No, you just got to know,
02:37:20 you just got to plan it out.
02:37:21 Well, Radcon three really helped us.
02:37:24 My Vapors Kickstarter was a huge success
02:37:28 and didn't go over budget.
02:37:29 And all my stretch goals were delivered upon
02:37:32 and Vapors two will be the same thing.
02:37:34 For the record.
02:37:35 It will be a triumph.
02:37:36 For the record.
02:37:37 Absolutely nothing is my fault
02:37:39 in terms of the DVDs and the plebe and the weave.
02:37:42 I literally woke up one day
02:37:44 and saw my name on a Kickstarter
02:37:46 that I had no idea about
02:37:47 that already had like $8,000 attached to it.
02:37:50 And I'm just like, well, I guess I'm doing this now.
02:37:52 It pretty much went like I said,
02:37:54 hey, Jesse, we should do a Kickstarter
02:37:55 for plebe and the weave season two.
02:37:56 And he was like, sure.
02:37:57 And then I posted it immediately.
02:37:59 Like I just did that.
02:38:01 And then, yeah.
02:38:03 But no, I mean, the circumstances around it were crazy.
02:38:05 Like it's not, I don't feel bad at all.
02:38:07 Like I don't give a shit if anybody thinks
02:38:10 that that was like a failure because it was.
02:38:12 I don't consider it a failure just because
02:38:14 I think the episodes turned out really good.
02:38:16 Yes, people enjoyed it.
02:38:18 It came out good.
02:38:19 I am still holding on to all these fucking Blu-rays.
02:38:22 So it's not as though it is,
02:38:25 it's not as though I give it up on.
02:38:26 We're gonna have green-rays by the time you're done with these.
02:38:28 I don't really give a shit.
02:38:29 I mean, like, you know, whatever.
02:38:31 Time is completely relative.
02:38:33 You know, one time I own,
02:38:34 I've told this story before,
02:38:35 but one time my friend bought me $60 worth of art books
02:38:38 and I told him I'll pay you back when I get a job.
02:38:40 It took me 60 years to get a job.
02:38:41 But I paid him back on my first paycheck.
02:38:43 I will get the fucking Blu-rays out, you know?
02:38:46 Okay, there you go, fair enough.
02:38:47 You know, the thing about it is
02:38:51 we just need to set the amount that we make
02:38:55 just a lot higher than the cost
02:38:57 of what it sounds like it should cost, you know?
02:39:00 And of course, we feel a desire to not do that.
02:39:02 So it's easier to meet the goal,
02:39:04 but that's a negative if we end up just missing money.
02:39:06 I would say, you know,
02:39:07 set the goal higher than the amount we need
02:39:11 and make sure people are actually getting paid to do it.
02:39:14 That's another thing with Radcon 3.
02:39:15 Like, we covered the cost of it,
02:39:17 but that doesn't include actually paying anybody,
02:39:19 which really becomes a problem when the editing starts
02:39:22 and all of us have to get,
02:39:23 you know, we have to rush back to our own patreons
02:39:25 to make more money, you know, like nobody has time
02:39:28 to edit the shit that we did at Radcon.
02:39:30 So like, there needs to be editing fees,
02:39:33 actual payment for doing it.
02:39:35 And then like, yeah,
02:39:37 just factoring in additional costs to just have around,
02:39:40 like maybe like a bubble.
02:39:41 I feel like a hundred dollar bubble
02:39:43 that just goes to whatever it's needed for.
02:39:44 And then once everything's complete,
02:39:47 that money would just be dispersed
02:39:48 to everybody equally or something.
02:39:50 But like-
02:39:51 I totally agree.
02:39:51 And I just think that, yeah,
02:39:53 questions are super important.
02:39:54 There's things we don't predict.
02:39:55 But just like after Radcon,
02:39:57 like not even just the way that we assessed costs
02:40:00 with Radcon 3, which was too little
02:40:02 and we'll like know somewhat better next time,
02:40:04 but like even beyond that-
02:40:05 And we weren't even that off.
02:40:06 It was only like, what?
02:40:07 How much did we go?
02:40:08 Well, I mean, dude,
02:40:09 the biggest thing we were off about was shipping costs.
02:40:10 Shipping costs were so much more.
02:40:12 But that right there,
02:40:13 but the thing is we have the numbers
02:40:15 of exactly what it costs for Tom to ship those out.
02:40:18 Not that it would necessarily be him again,
02:40:19 but like we,
02:40:20 that is a super valuable piece of data.
02:40:22 So we know exactly,
02:40:23 like we can way more accurately determine that.
02:40:25 Even better now,
02:40:25 did you just find a way to get ship cheaper from his-
02:40:28 Yes.
02:40:29 Stamps.com is a great way to ship things cheap.
02:40:33 We will definitely be-
02:40:34 Wait, what?
02:40:35 Stamps.com.
02:40:36 Oh yeah, right, right.
02:40:37 Okay, well, yeah, that's great.
02:40:38 So, you know, I think that we actually said
02:40:40 5,800 was the minimum.
02:40:42 So it's probably gonna be more than that, people,
02:40:44 for the next one.
02:40:45 So, oh, oh, I was just gonna say.
02:40:47 I think we can do it.
02:40:48 I mean, people loved Radcon 3.
02:40:49 We got that funded after, you know, post-Radcon 2.
02:40:53 Radcon 3 still got funded.
02:40:54 Radcon 3 went well.
02:40:56 People love the results.
02:40:57 I don't know if somebody,
02:40:58 I don't know if there's gonna be people saying,
02:40:59 hey, you know, I wanna pay for Radcon 3,
02:41:01 but they're stealing your dad's still as an out.
02:41:04 So, you know, I don't know-
02:41:05 Was that a promise though?
02:41:07 No, it wasn't a promise, but...
02:41:09 I mean, it was promised by me to people
02:41:11 that we had done it and it would come out, you know.
02:41:14 That's fair.
02:41:15 You know, I will say the last thing on this
02:41:17 is just that, like, I don't like doing things
02:41:19 where I don't make a profit doing them.
02:41:21 I just don't like doing them.
02:41:23 So I really want to make sure that future Radcons
02:41:26 are not just a financial black hole,
02:41:28 because I'm trying to, you know,
02:41:29 trying to earn while doing things like this,
02:41:31 not just lose, just because they're fun.
02:41:33 You know, I mean, I wanna do it,
02:41:34 because, you know, I do think, like that guy said,
02:41:37 a lot of the best content we've done comes out of it,
02:41:39 just because it's such a unique experience
02:41:41 that, like, you know, when else would you get anything like it?
02:41:45 You know?
02:41:46 Yeah.
02:41:47 What I like about living in Boston is that now I'm with,
02:41:50 like, Ben and we, like, hang out, like, you know, for fun.
02:41:53 Like, we're friends or something.
02:41:54 I don't like that. I don't like that.
02:41:56 It's weird, right?
02:41:57 It's really cool, because what I really-
02:41:59 It's quirky.
02:42:00 What I like about Radcon is a lot of, like,
02:42:02 just, like, being around people who are also creative
02:42:04 and I also respect and I think are, like, interesting
02:42:06 and I like to talk to, and just outside of even just
02:42:10 the pure, like, carnal, mortal pleasure
02:42:12 being with your friends, which is great.
02:42:14 Also, just, like, being with other creatives
02:42:16 and, like, coming up with ideas and projects together
02:42:18 is, like, really interesting and valuable,
02:42:20 and I love doing that.
02:42:21 What's cool about Radcon is that we're all there to make-
02:42:23 Yes. Agreed.
02:42:24 Yes. Very true.
02:42:26 We're all on the same page about what we're doing there.
02:42:27 It's basically just, like, lightning ideas all the time.
02:42:30 It's just, like, everybody sitting around going, like,
02:42:32 okay, well, we did that thing, what do we do now?
02:42:36 You know, like, it could be literally, like,
02:42:38 oh, Nate and Hippo are doing a podcast in that room,
02:42:41 so fuck them, what can we do that is, like,
02:42:44 that not only we can do without them,
02:42:47 but also that is funny specifically because
02:42:50 they are in that room doing that while we do this, you know?
02:42:53 When I think about just the idea of Radcon,
02:42:55 my instinct is, like, oh, a bunch of people
02:42:57 get together and make shit, sounds gay as shit,
02:42:59 except that every time we do it,
02:43:01 it's just produces such actually good things
02:43:03 that, like, I'm constantly kind of astounded,
02:43:05 like, wow, that's actually really funny and good.
02:43:08 I still have yet to post the soon-to-be,
02:43:11 someday-to-be award-winning sitcom, The Man and the Boy.
02:43:16 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
02:43:17 The Man and the Boy.
02:43:18 How's The Man and the Boy not alive yet?
02:43:20 Is that, like, the only Munchy Jesse content, like?
02:43:23 I think it is.
02:43:24 Probably. Yeah.
02:43:25 Me and Munchy at Radcon 3, we...
02:43:30 Very impromptu.
02:43:31 We conceived, filmed, improvised, and created
02:43:36 an entire sitcom called The Man and the Boy,
02:43:39 and there's multiple episodes,
02:43:40 and it's probably a nightmare, but it's great.
02:43:44 Jesse plays the titular man, and I play the titular boy,
02:43:47 and then the adventures we get up to
02:43:49 are unparalleled in scope and execution.
02:43:52 We have to get that out
02:43:53 because it's never gonna happen again.
02:43:55 If you do another season,
02:43:56 it's just gonna be The Man and the Man.
02:43:57 Oh, my God.
02:43:58 Oh, my God.
02:44:00 And if Munchy doesn't release the Stealing Your Dads episodes,
02:44:04 then it won't be easy anymore.
02:44:07 It'll be hard to steal Dads.
02:44:09 It will always be easy.
02:44:12 I don't know. It seems pretty difficult right now.
02:44:14 Yeah, it seems like it's been a...
02:44:15 It seems like a big labor.
02:44:16 It's hard for me to steal a Dad
02:44:18 if I can't watch the episode.
02:44:20 Okay, all right.
02:44:22 Enough of this, people.
02:44:22 Let's move on. We've got two quick last ones.
02:44:26 Okay, first of all, we've got Mozilla Fennekin, human core.
02:44:29 And this was the guy.
02:44:30 This Mozilla was the one who asked us,
02:44:32 yes, last time, what is human core?
02:44:35 So let's hear.
02:44:35 So now we're drilling this closure.
02:44:37 I just want to say that just something about human core,
02:44:40 just it rubbed me the wrong way.
02:44:42 And like, just phonetically,
02:44:44 just like there's just something
02:44:45 I don't like about this community.
02:44:45 I thought you were the one who like invented it.
02:44:47 I thought you were the human core.
02:44:49 I invented it.
02:44:49 Yeah, we had this discussion last time.
02:44:51 I remember me inventing it too,
02:44:53 though I guess I will defer to Ben
02:44:56 Okay, so if anyone remembers the invention of human core.
02:44:59 Let us know.
02:45:00 Who invented human core?
02:45:02 I think it was like either one of us invented it,
02:45:06 the other person ran with it, just either or.
02:45:08 I think it was definitely like developed over time.
02:45:12 Okay, well, let's hear.
02:45:13 However, I want you all to know,
02:45:16 I want you all to know that you can buy
02:45:18 human core shirts at teespring.com
02:45:21 slash stores slash Ben Dash thing.
02:45:23 Oh my God, that's all right.
02:45:25 I'm selling them.
02:45:26 I'm selling, you're buying them.
02:45:27 And instead of giving Ben $5 on Teespring,
02:45:29 just buy a shirt from me directly
02:45:31 where I'll get all the proceeds.
02:45:34 I get $10 per shirt, thank you very much.
02:45:37 9.50.
02:45:38 I've been told that the shirts from Teespring
02:45:39 smell bad and don't fit well.
02:45:42 I've got some.
02:45:43 Not my experience.
02:45:44 They don't fit well.
02:45:45 I think they're fine.
02:45:46 Oh, my, okay, I don't, all right.
02:45:49 If you guys say so, I get the classic V-neck
02:45:53 and they all fit great.
02:45:55 And like my Teespring shirts are like my favorite shirts
02:45:58 that I own.
02:45:59 Well, if you'd like there to say, buy Ben's shirts.
02:46:03 Okay, all right.
02:46:04 Let's go, patron saint of human core,
02:46:06 a paragon of wisdom in the human core sphere.
02:46:08 Mozilla Fennekin, educate us, go.
02:46:14 Last time I asked you what the most human core thing ever is.
02:46:19 It's something that all humans do
02:46:21 and nothing else does it.
02:46:24 It's only a human thing.
02:46:25 Shitting.
02:46:26 Your responses were very thoughtful and very interesting.
02:46:30 I appreciate that you participated in this.
02:46:33 And so you're wrong.
02:46:36 The most human core thing ever is having a bathroom.
02:46:44 Okay, hear me out, hear me out.
02:46:47 Get out of here.
02:46:48 I already said shitting, I was right.
02:46:51 Every animal or whatever, it's like,
02:46:54 they just kind of shit wherever.
02:46:58 This is so bad.
02:46:59 That's not even true.
02:47:00 We have our own designated shit space.
02:47:03 Like we have to have our own room.
02:47:05 What is a fucking litter box?
02:47:07 I mean, you might think, true,
02:47:09 you know, cats have a bottle or whatever,
02:47:11 but we decide that for them.
02:47:12 No, they would do that anyway.
02:47:14 Not for that, they just kind of shit wherever.
02:47:17 Same thing with dogs, like we just kind of say,
02:47:19 don't shit in the house, they'll just shit wherever.
02:47:21 We're like the only people that just don't decide
02:47:24 to just shit on the floor or throw it around or wherever.
02:47:29 God, humans are so fucking weird.
02:47:31 What happened?
02:47:32 Okay, okay, I'm pretty sure.
02:47:34 I know that's a stupid answer.
02:47:36 Yeah.
02:47:36 Get out of here.
02:47:38 He's missing too.
02:47:39 All right, full as we am.
02:47:40 I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure there are animals
02:47:44 who have designated,
02:47:46 like monkeys must have like a place they go to shit, right?
02:47:48 They don't just like, well, unless they live in the trees,
02:47:50 I don't know, but the ones that live on the ground
02:47:52 must have like a place.
02:47:53 They've got to, right?
02:47:55 I don't think he did any research.
02:47:56 Or they shit in the river or something.
02:47:57 There has to be another animal that has a shit place.
02:48:00 I'm sure there is.
02:48:02 I'm sure there is.
02:48:03 I'm gonna Google it right now.
02:48:05 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:48:06 Animals shit in a, in a shit place.
02:48:11 Do they shit in a society?
02:48:12 Oh, okay, right here, right here, earth.
02:48:14 Animals invented public toilets long before we did.
02:48:17 Article on the BBC from 2015.
02:48:20 I'm afraid you're done.
02:48:21 You're all done cheating.
02:48:22 Animal latrine, places where the wildlife animals
02:48:25 habitually defecate or urinate.
02:48:26 There's a whole list of them
02:48:28 and the whole list of people that do it.
02:48:30 No, no, no, only humans have toilets.
02:48:33 Only a human shit in the same spot.
02:48:35 Mozilla, Fennec, we're just gonna land back.
02:48:38 You're going in the voice jail.
02:48:40 You're so fucking stupid.
02:48:41 Voice jail.
02:48:42 Yeah, voice jail.
02:48:43 You're probably falling with something
02:48:44 that just is factually wrong,
02:48:46 but then you have the gall to admit that it's stupid.
02:48:49 You weren't even sticking to your fucking guns.
02:48:51 I fucking hate you, Mozilla Fennec.
02:48:54 Kill yourself, kill yourself.
02:48:57 All right, let's go into jail.
02:48:59 He's going to jail.
02:49:00 Mozilla Fennec, I'm sorry.
02:49:01 You were a good man for a long time.
02:49:03 You gave us good stuff, but it's fucking over, dude.
02:49:07 All right, well, incidentally.
02:49:08 Game over.
02:49:09 Game over.
02:49:10 We have one more voice message from one Mozilla Fennec'n.
02:49:16 Actually, it's called Special Announcement.
02:49:19 It's a special announcement from a man in jail.
02:49:22 Let's hear what he has to say.
02:49:23 OK, all right, go.
02:49:25 Hey, PCPs, sorry I haven't submitted a voicemail
02:49:27 in a long time.
02:49:28 I've been so busy doing this fucking compilation
02:49:32 of all of the best and worst voicemails in the PCPs history.
02:49:36 And you're in the worst.
02:49:37 You heard that, Mike.
02:49:38 Best and worst of compilation of PCP voicemails,
02:49:42 because that's the only thing people care about with this
02:49:44 podcast now.
02:49:46 This is an ongoing project, and to prove
02:49:49 that I'm not completely full of shit,
02:49:50 I have already made a compilation for the 2018 episodes.
02:49:54 You can find it at my side shit channel, Luxvanlavixi.
02:49:57 That's L-U-X-V-A-N-L-U-V-I-X-I.
02:50:02 I'm going to post a 2019 compilation at the end of the
02:50:05 year, but I'd like some feedback from some other people.
02:50:08 Suggestions as to which voicemails to include would be nice.
02:50:12 But mainly, I want to know if I should include 2018's voicemails
02:50:16 in the 2019 compilation, since voicemails weren't really
02:50:19 introduced until around August last year.
02:50:22 It also has some continuing sagas, like the Great Discord
02:50:26 War that happened.
02:50:27 So let me know.
02:50:29 Comment on the video.
02:50:30 You can find me on Twitter at Mozilla Fennigan.
02:50:33 I'm in the Patreon Discord as well.
02:50:35 I'm really easy to find.
02:50:36 OK.
02:50:37 He's in the voice chat.
02:50:38 I just want to let you know that's what I'm doing.
02:50:40 See you in like five months, unless I kill myself or something.
02:50:43 Go away.
02:50:44 I can't wait to see the 2019 where it's just you.
02:50:47 It's just all of your voicemails compiled into this section.
02:50:51 Poor bastard.
02:50:53 Well, I'm glad someone's doing it.
02:50:54 Yeah, no, this is a good thing.
02:50:55 This is a good service he's doing.
02:50:57 I appreciate it.
02:50:58 I don't know if he's doing it.
02:51:00 I don't know if it's a good thing.
02:51:01 That's like saying Hitler had some good ideas.
02:51:04 I mean, we all know that's true.
02:51:06 At least he's staying productive in jail, getting something done.
02:51:11 Should we let him out of jail?
02:51:12 No.
02:51:13 No.
02:51:14 No.
02:51:15 No.
02:51:16 No.

02:52:03 No.
02:52:04 include channels oh my god really that that that's that's how unfortunately
02:52:08 that's the only way you can find grimp is you search a grim but you search for
02:52:11 a channel you set the filter to channel I guess I'm spelling it wrong okay
02:52:14 whatever I wanted to actually go check this out maybe if I find it maybe it'll
02:52:18 be the show notes I don't know we'll see okay anyway that's it people better
02:52:22 voicemails then next time please you said something that was factually
02:52:28 inaccurate on the PCP because we all know that this is just a pillar of
02:52:31 objectivity on the show speak pipe link down below give us voice messages and
02:52:38 patreon.com slash the procrastinators five dollars you get the bonus episodes by
02:52:44 the time you hear this we'll a new one be out real quick proposition Nate I
02:52:48 think we should do this for the voicemails and I don't know if you've
02:52:53 listened to dick Masterson does this on his show who are these podcasts started
02:52:58 doing it as well where they they have like the ending of the show and then
02:53:02 they do voicemails like they'll play an outro they they they say all their you
02:53:06 know all the plugs and everything then they do voicemails just because so many
02:53:10 people hate voicemails that like people love the voicemails they're like
02:53:14 everyone's favorite part I mean it really depends on the person I mean I
02:53:18 don't know how people feel on this show initially seemed like there were a lot
02:53:20 of people who had bigger problems at the voice get a straw poll and show notes
02:53:23 let's find out just I just want to know like cuz like these shows are long as
02:53:27 shit and I know when people see like three hours it's just like oh my god how
02:53:32 long is this gonna be you know but like if we had an outro after the before the
02:53:36 voicemail so just make people who didn't want to sit for three hours just feel
02:53:39 like oh I can go now you know I hear you and I'm sympathetic to that and I want
02:53:43 to do things if that's we can clean people are more likely to listen through
02:53:46 that that's good but you know we'll a half an hour make that much difference
02:53:51 usually an hour bro yeah it's like it's pretty long okay you might be right you
02:53:54 might be right let us know what do you think of this idea okay yeah let us know
02:53:58 I'm open to although I made it far enough to hear me say that clearly
02:54:02 listens to the full episode oh shit I you're right that's that's a just that's
02:54:06 a that's a bad skew of the people listening okay anyway so by the time you
02:54:09 hear this people new bonus that was that won't be out but it'll be out two days
