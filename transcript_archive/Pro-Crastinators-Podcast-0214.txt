00:00:00 Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:08 the best guy ever, and we're joined by Gibbontake, and Ben Saint. There he goes. Truly hilarious.
00:00:24 The joke police are here. They're not lovin' it. They're not lovin' it.
00:00:28 Hey, I'm peacefully whoop whoopin' over here. I'm peacefully whoop whoopin'.
00:00:32 Is that like a personal attack or something?
00:00:35 You're beating me with batons.
00:00:44 No, my scholarship!
00:00:50 Alright, let's cut right to the chase. Listen, I have an announcement to make. There's been a change in my life.
00:00:56 This is an important one. This is probably the biggest paradigm shift in the last five to ten years of my life.
00:01:01 Alright, it goes by a singular name, and that name is Drakengard III, Kuroi Hana, 100% Shower Speed Runs.
00:01:11 That's the summary. I will now elaborate on the subject matter.
00:01:16 Please.
00:01:17 Yes, so there's the song. It's the final battle boss song in Drakengard III.
00:01:21 Wait, wait, create demand and then fulfill it.
00:01:23 Indeed, indeed.
00:01:25 Drakengard III final boss song in Branch D.
00:01:29 Last thing, you fight a big demon flower boss with a bunch of ladies in it.
00:01:34 The song plays called Kuroi Hana.
00:01:37 I have become the hero, the founder, organizer, chief executive of the speedrunning community around showering while listening to this song
00:01:48 and attempting to beat speedrun strats at various percentile categories to take your shower as fast as possible.
00:01:56 Yes, that's right. Why is a video game song have to be linked to taking a shower in any way?
00:02:01 Why not just do it with a timer? Fuck you, it doesn't matter. This is just how it works.
00:02:06 This is the community, and if you don't like it, then you can just leave.
00:02:09 So here's the deal. Let me break it down for you.
00:02:12 There are seven tiers of success that you can reach in an average speedrun of the Kuroi Hana 100% or any percent runs.
00:02:20 Let me just say right out the back, any percent runs, literal trash, if you do them, kill yourself.
00:02:26 Don't do it. It's a mistake.
00:02:28 Hold on. Set the foundation for this. Why would you want to take a shower at a specific amount of time?
00:02:35 Why would anyone want to speedrun anything?
00:02:37 Is it good to have a short shower? Is that where this came from?
00:02:41 Absolutely.
00:02:42 Is it safe water? Is it for the environment?
00:02:45 The origin of it was simply I was listening to Kuroi Hana in the shower, because it's like an almost an eight minute long song.
00:02:53 So it's good and long. It's plenty of time to shower and stuff.
00:02:55 And I was like, I could be efficient about this.
00:02:58 And I got into a pattern of listening to the song every time.
00:03:01 I understand.
00:03:05 So here's how the lore breaks down.
00:03:07 So during the boss fight, in this climactic moment of Dragon Guard 3, basically the song is slash the boss itself.
00:03:16 You play as a dragon Mikhail fighting against this big flower thing, the Intoners or whatever.
00:03:21 So there's six Intoner girls.
00:03:24 And each of them, in fact, you guys should just take a look at the aesthetic of this fight just to get an idea for it.
00:03:30 There will be links in the show notes to this.
00:03:32 Here you to take a peek at this. Just skip in like a few minutes in or whatever.
00:03:36 So these big white girls who you have known, I mean, they're literally white, they're like stone.
00:03:42 They've been like your main character and the other bosses basically of the game.
00:03:48 But now they appear bursting out of the petals of this flower, which is kind of the source of all issues in the game.
00:03:55 So it's broken down into seven chunks.
00:03:58 The first chunk is with zero.
00:04:00 And then it goes five, four, three, two, one.
00:04:03 And then finally all of them together.
00:04:05 So we call these categories getting a one or a five or a four or three or a two or a one or or the shame.
00:04:11 We'll shame for all of 15.
00:04:13 All right.
00:04:14 So getting a zero category is the Holy Grail.
00:04:16 No one's ever done it.
00:04:18 That's an under one minute and 35 second category.
00:04:21 Can it be achieved?
00:04:22 Scholars still speculate to this day.
00:04:24 We think obviously the optimal strats are going to be had because running doing an average run requires, of course,
00:04:31 shampooing, conditioning, full body soaping.
00:04:35 You have to get the full body coverage.
00:04:37 There can be no skipping.
00:04:38 That's what makes it 100% run.
00:04:40 Oh, and just so everybody knows the rules of the game where the time is concerned.
00:04:43 Timer starts when you get into the shower.
00:04:46 So you're dry at first.
00:04:48 You then get wet in the shower and the timer stops when you turn off the water.
00:04:54 Toweling.
00:04:55 Some people include it in their categories.
00:04:57 Not I.
00:04:58 Not I.
00:04:59 It is not part of the speed run.
00:05:02 There you go.
00:05:03 That's the facts.
00:05:04 So you get under a one minute and 35.
00:05:07 That's the Holy Grail zero.
00:05:09 You get under a two minute and 13 second.
00:05:11 It's a fiver.
00:05:12 Then two minute 59, three minutes and 40 seconds, four minutes and 20 seconds.
00:05:16 That's for 20 very based.
00:05:18 And then a winner is five minutes and six seconds.
00:05:22 Anything beyond that, you're in the 15 category.
00:05:24 It's absolutely embarrassing.
00:05:26 So I have taken the liberty of doing several runs and I'll tell you my scores right now.
00:05:33 Over the last week, my, my original personal best here was a four minute and 34 second.
00:05:40 That's a one or not great, not great.
00:05:43 Then I was, I was able to achieve a three minute and 15 second run.
00:05:50 And so far that's my best.
00:05:51 Solid three year and I'm hoping to bag a four on my next run.
00:05:56 And you will see, by the way, if you look, click at the links down below, the rules will be posted.
00:06:02 This will be our central hub.
00:06:04 This link to this video, because this is a community activity.
00:06:08 This is the song that is being used seven minutes, 56 seconds long.
00:06:12 You will see my comment as best guy ever under there describing my 100% personal best of three minutes, 15 seconds.
00:06:19 And I want to see other people flooding this comment section with their 100% speed runs to see who will be the fastest shower Kuro black flower boy.
00:06:30 There you go.
00:06:31 So there's the challenge that's been thrown down.
00:06:33 We're going to operate on an honor system until money gets involved.
00:06:37 And then we'll get in contact, of course, with AGDQ.
00:06:39 We'll get some on camera runs done right now.
00:06:43 Community.
00:06:45 We're just, we're hoping to grow.
00:06:47 So we want more people to join the community and see what people are able to achieve.
00:06:53 You know, everyone's going to be lined up in the men's locker room.
00:06:59 So that's pretty good.
00:07:02 Now we can't.
00:07:03 Unfortunately, it's true.
00:07:05 We can't ignore biology.
00:07:07 Small people have less surface area to cover.
00:07:10 They have an unfair advantage, but that's just life.
00:07:12 But they also have smaller brains.
00:07:15 That's true.
00:07:16 They probably won't be able to optimize as much.
00:07:18 It just means we're able to use our instincts better.
00:07:23 It's true.
00:07:24 And you know what?
00:07:25 Oh, right, right.
00:07:27 And also, you know, a large discussion was had about what about people shaving their head and going bald to optimize these strats.
00:07:36 It was concluded that you must have hair and a separate category has been created for bald individuals.
00:07:42 It's only fair.
00:07:44 This is the most contentious decision yet.
00:07:46 That is contentious.
00:07:48 I don't know.
00:07:49 I feel like no hair, short hair, and long hair are like...
00:07:57 I feel like there's a middle ground there.
00:07:59 There should be categories for each of these.
00:08:00 I feel like if you wanted, you could split it.
00:08:03 I think for each category of hair, you have to trim it to the exact designated length.
00:08:09 You're going to have to...
00:08:10 It's going to be...
00:08:11 It goes to the higher...
00:08:13 Well, I think what it's got to be is weight categories.
00:08:16 And if you're in a weight category, you are going to want to trim to the shortest possible length for your weight category, anything else in your suboptimal.
00:08:26 Actually, there's also size categories.
00:08:29 So you have to submit a full body plaster print of your entire body for the judges to measure to gauge how much surface area they have to cover during the shower.
00:08:38 I would actually suggest...
00:08:40 Okay, what you need to do is fully fill your bathtub up, immerse yourself in the bathtub, measure the displaced water, and give a volume measurement of yourself by measuring the displaced water, and base the categories on that.
00:09:01 What is the opinion on glitch runs?
00:09:06 I've managed to do a glitch where I can skip through the water and I don't even have to get wet.
00:09:14 This is a glitchless run.
00:09:16 I'm running glitchless.
00:09:17 It's the most popular category because one person is doing it me and I'm winning so far.
00:09:22 The glitch runs, they're just a separate category.
00:09:25 You just don't turn on the shower, you win.
00:09:28 Yeah, pretty much.
00:09:31 That's why any percent runs are such a joke.
00:09:34 You walk in, you touch water for literally...
00:09:36 It's measured in microseconds.
00:09:38 You just touch the water in the shower and then immediately clip out of the wall and hit the timer stop.
00:09:44 It's not good.
00:09:45 It just doesn't make for a very compelling run, is all.
00:09:48 I'm trying to think of holes I can poke in this in the name of glitch testing.
00:09:58 In the name of stress testing the concept.
00:10:01 It has been discussed.
00:10:02 I mean, do you have to shampoo and condition your pubic hair as well?
00:10:06 What about arm, leg, and back hair?
00:10:08 What about your eyelashes?
00:10:09 Taking under advisement.
00:10:10 Eyelashes, taking under advisement.
00:10:11 Only hair on your head.
00:10:12 Only hair on your head.
00:10:13 Right now.
00:10:14 Do you have to condition?
00:10:16 Actually, do you have to shampoo?
00:10:17 Yes, you have to condition.
00:10:18 You have to shampoo and condition.
00:10:20 These are in the rules.
00:10:21 There was also, of course, discussion about what's the correct order of operations.
00:10:26 Should it be enforced by the rules that you have to shampoo, then condition, leave the conditioner in your hair?
00:10:31 And then soap, and then washed all out afterward.
00:10:35 It was decided no, you can do it in any order, but you should do it that way, or you're an idiot without proper hygiene.
00:10:41 But that's another factor.
00:10:43 I mean, if I want to win the speed run, the hygiene is the least of my worries.
00:10:48 I just want to get it handled on as fast as possible.
00:10:51 There's been no bonus found.
00:10:53 There's been no bonus found in doing it in any particular order, so you might as well do it.
00:10:56 It gives you the luxurious hair.
00:11:01 See, we've thought about that.
00:11:02 Nobody said I need to get the shampoo and conditioner out of my hair.
00:11:05 If I just get the water on and then put the shower and just turn the water off, put the stuff on afterwards.
00:11:12 I'll tell you what's really split in the community right now, though.
00:11:14 The two-in-one shampoo and conditioner products that are so popular these days.
00:11:19 That seems like a no-brainer.
00:11:20 Absolutely tearing the community apart as to whether or not it's allowed.
00:11:24 What about one of those six-in-one conditioner shampoo, moisturizer, body wash, whatever?
00:11:34 That seems like such an obvious tech for the run.
00:11:41 You're obviously right.
00:11:42 The thing is, though, that gets into the core discussion about what is the spirit of the event meant to be.
00:11:47 It goes beyond simply, like, there has to be discussions about that.
00:11:50 I feel like it's perfectly within the spirit.
00:11:52 Because if that product really does do all those things, then, like...
00:11:56 Yeah.
00:11:57 Yeah.
00:11:58 Which raises the question, why doesn't everyone just use it normally under normal circumstances?
00:12:04 There's also the question of outside tools.
00:12:06 Like, for example, could I simply step into the shower, turn in the water, pull a lever to dump a bucket I have prepared with massive quantities of all-in-one body wash shampoo and conditioner?
00:12:17 Have it completely blast over my body in two seconds and then wash it off.
00:12:21 We've got to standardize the shower head, the brand.
00:12:24 Right.
00:12:25 That too.
00:12:26 What if you technically have the...
00:12:29 Now you have the shower head on, but you leave the drain closed, causing the tub to fill as though it were a bath, and you actually jump into the bathtub and roll around in it to get yourself wetter faster.
00:12:42 That's because you do have to get fully desoped at the end, too.
00:12:45 That might be a more optimal strat.
00:12:47 The clog at the end might be an advantage.
00:12:50 Actually, I think that would probably make washing your feet and getting the soap off your feet more difficult.
00:12:55 I don't know if that would actually save any time, but you know, you've got to exhaust all possibilities.
00:13:00 You might lose a few frames at the end if you have to step out and then wipe the soap off and you can't just do it in the shower itself.
00:13:07 You could lose frames there, yeah.
00:13:08 Definitely.
00:13:09 Damn, this is a rich meta has evolved.
00:13:13 I want to hear people give details on your strats.
00:13:16 Let's see who is doing the best next week.
00:13:19 I will be looking at the comment section of that video.
00:13:22 I want to be flooded and be able to be deeply confused as to what's going on on this video.
00:13:28 It's got 4 million views.
00:13:29 They've had their time.
00:13:31 It's our time now.
00:13:32 I think at first, I was hearing you talk and I was like, what is this?
00:13:37 This is bizarre.
00:13:39 This is a strange and esoteric ritual.
00:13:42 This is some kind of death cult.
00:13:45 But now I'm fully invested and fully on board and it makes perfect sense and even a child could understand it.
00:13:53 What's the community's opinion on Nightcore and or Vaporwave renditions of the song?
00:14:01 I forgot this was about a song.
00:14:04 Wait a minute, what's even the point of the song?
00:14:06 Ben, we already covered that at the beginning.
00:14:09 It doesn't matter.
00:14:10 It's the spirit of the event.
00:14:11 It is totally arbitrary.
00:14:13 It gives us fun categorizations to use.
00:14:16 Seven tiers.
00:14:17 Which tier are you?
00:14:18 I'm tier...
00:14:19 Wait, what tier am I?
00:14:20 I think I'm tier 3.
00:14:21 I'm no more tiers.
00:14:24 I'm tier 4.
00:14:25 Which is shameful.
00:14:26 No more tiers.
00:14:31 That was good.
00:14:34 Incidentally, no more tier shampoo.
00:14:36 Up banned.
00:14:37 You have to deal with the tiers.
00:14:39 Extra tiers.
00:14:41 Extra tiers is the only approved shampoo.
00:14:47 What if you just shampoo with a fucking bar soap?
00:14:51 Actually, I would liquid soap versus bar soap.
00:14:55 Lufa or no Lufa?
00:14:57 These are allowed.
00:14:59 I'm sure they're allowed.
00:15:01 I was assuming they were allowed but I would want to know which one.
00:15:06 I guess you just have to experiment.
00:15:07 I've been a bar man.
00:15:08 When you got the bar, you don't have to pump the thing to prep the Lufa which might lose
00:15:15 time.
00:15:16 You don't have to wait for the bar to soften under the hot water.
00:15:21 I feel like the liquid soap spreads faster.
00:15:23 I feel like Lufa is probably a time sink.
00:15:28 That's going to be allowable.
00:15:29 I shouldn't be in the sink in the first place.
00:15:33 What about Lufa on a stick that lets you save the frames of bending over to reach your
00:15:37 soap on a rope?
00:15:38 That could make sense.
00:15:39 Time saver?
00:15:40 I don't know.
00:15:41 I don't know what it's for in the first place.
00:15:45 Really makes you think.
00:15:46 Just optimize your shower, bro.
00:15:48 That's the point.
00:15:49 But to this very specific song from Dragon Guard 3.
00:15:53 The real lesson, the real high level is you get out of the shower.
00:16:00 You break your PR.
00:16:03 One day you get a new PB in your category.
00:16:10 And then you realize, wait a minute.
00:16:12 Why don't I do this with every single thing I do every fucking day with the same song?
00:16:22 Playing the song at all times to optimize.
00:16:24 Every time you finish anything and start any new thing, you smack the timer like you're
00:16:30 playing speed chess and you just start the song and you go.
00:16:33 Was I a 3-year?
00:16:34 Was I a 1-year?
00:16:35 Was I a shameful 15-year?
00:16:36 Eating, eating, cooking breakfast.
00:16:38 Here's the deplor.
00:16:39 Eating breakfast.
00:16:40 Driving to work.
00:16:41 Yeah, absolutely.
00:16:43 Raising child.
00:16:46 Bonding with family.
00:16:48 Just as optimal as possible.
00:16:50 Why aren't we bonding by playing Dragon Guard 3 and beating the final boss as fast as possible?
00:16:57 It's a 15er, by the way, because you're fighting all of the intoners at once.
00:17:02 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.
00:17:04 The total of which is 15.
00:17:06 There's some deplor for you.
00:17:08 Summoning salts.
00:17:10 Your next video.
00:17:12 I expect to see the history of Castlevania.
00:17:14 Stop.
00:17:15 Mario Kart.
00:17:16 No fucking punch outs.
00:17:19 Cease.
00:17:20 This is the one.
00:17:21 This is the one.
00:17:22 We've got a story history.
00:17:23 We are going to be at HQ.
00:17:26 We're going to win.
00:17:28 We're going to do a silly one at the end.
00:17:30 If we hit $10 million raised for whatever the fuck, then we'll be doing actually beating the boss in Dragon Guard 3 while showering, doing both at the same time.
00:17:40 That's the equivalent of the blindfolded.
00:17:43 Yeah.
00:17:44 You've got to optimize your strat to avoid it being destroyed by the water.
00:17:47 You've got to dodge the shower droplets.
00:17:50 The individual droplets, yeah.
00:17:54 So there it is.
00:17:56 The category is exploding.
00:17:58 Okay, good thinking.
00:18:02 There it is.
00:18:03 Boy, that really got my noodle going.
00:18:05 We were talking about this on the stream the other day, and it is now real. It's official.
00:18:11 Please join in.
00:18:12 We await your comments on that video that I don't own.
00:18:16 What, on Twitch?
00:18:19 No, this is the official Dragon Guard 3 song that is being used as the hub for all these things.
00:18:25 Got it.
00:18:27 Man, oh man, you think you know a video game.
00:18:30 Think you know a person.
00:18:31 Think you know a person, and then they tell you, hey, I just beat my PB in this.
00:18:37 Whatever, the Kuroi Hana.
00:18:39 Man, I thought you were a fiver, and they say, no dude, I'm a threer.
00:18:43 I'm a fourer.
00:18:44 I'm a oneer.
00:18:46 Actually, oneer's bad.
00:18:47 I'm a threeper.
00:18:48 Wait, a threeper.
00:18:50 Is that a thing?
00:18:51 It goes, zero is best, then five, four, three, two, one, fifteen.
00:18:54 I feel like there's something else that's called a threeper, but I don't know what that is.
00:18:58 That's a creeper, Ben. That's Minecraft.
00:19:00 No, it's like, is that like a name for like a hillbilly from Michigan or something?
00:19:06 No, that's Uper.
00:19:08 What's a threeper?
00:19:09 Damn it.
00:19:10 Okay, let me know in the comments.
00:19:11 Urban dictionary?
00:19:12 Urban dictionary.
00:19:13 Yep, yep, here we go, here we go.
00:19:14 Let me see.
00:19:16 I see a threeper, which is probably like a $3 bill.
00:19:20 I don't know.
00:19:21 Did I only dream that threeper?
00:19:22 A threeper is getting three things for the value of one.
00:19:24 Not a threeper.
00:19:25 Those shirts are a threeper.
00:19:26 No, no, no, no, no, no.
00:19:27 I don't know.
00:19:28 No, no, no, no, no, no.
00:19:30 Okay.
00:19:31 Well, that's it, lads.
00:19:32 That's my story.
00:19:33 Great.
00:19:34 I'm sticking to it.
00:19:35 Great.
00:19:36 Where's yours?
00:19:37 We've all grown on the stream or on this podcast.
00:19:40 No, no, no.
00:19:41 You haven't grown until the holy grail is hitting that zero tier.
00:19:45 You have to be, I know it can be done.
00:19:48 I know that a sub one minute, 35 second run is possible.
00:19:52 Someone out there do it.
00:19:53 Yeah.
00:19:54 But we need, don't forget, full body coverage of the soap.
00:19:57 That means behind the ears, between the toes.
00:19:59 I feel, you know, who's, who's, if you, okay, if the requirement, so you have to clean your
00:20:06 full body, right?
00:20:07 I feel like.
00:20:08 Absolutely.
00:20:09 Yes.
00:20:10 That's going to be so hard.
00:20:11 At least one coverage.
00:20:12 You know, people miss, people miss spots.
00:20:16 How are you?
00:20:17 How can you differentiate between someone who misses a spot and someone who doesn't?
00:20:21 Who's going to know?
00:20:22 Well, the judges, the judges will review your body.
00:20:25 They'll have to judge your cleanliness afterwards.
00:20:27 You go into one of those airport, like scanning things.
00:20:30 They scan for dirt particles.
00:20:32 Yeah.
00:20:33 Yeah.
00:20:34 Well, okay.
00:20:35 You then have to take a long, you then have to bathe yourself again afterwards.
00:20:41 Much takes much more time and then take the bathwater, you know, tested for like what percentage
00:20:47 dirt it is in order to determine your overall cleanliness.
00:20:51 Sure, sure.
00:20:52 I mean, it's not just about that though.
00:20:54 It's actually more about, cleanliness is important.
00:20:57 That's one metric used, but also surface area covered and touched by soap.
00:21:02 Yeah.
00:21:03 Both factors are used.
00:21:04 So the optimal start, of course, is if you're dirty, that's not going to work out.
00:21:07 You got to, I mean, you see an average Twitch, like let's, or speed runner on Twitch.
00:21:10 They'll do multiple runs.
00:21:11 Do multiple runs.
00:21:12 Shower before you're ready to shower and get yourself warmed up.
00:21:16 Get the gunk off the biggest chunks so that you're just ready for your optimal.
00:21:20 Just cover real fast with the bar or your optimal, you know, Loof or whatever.
00:21:25 That's, yeah, that's the way to play.
00:21:27 That's what we get yourself warmed up like any other speed runner would do.
00:21:29 I don't know.
00:21:31 It just makes it's just like doing research, you know, as every speed runner does.
00:21:39 To save the frames.
00:21:41 All right.
00:21:42 Same sort of thing.
00:21:43 What's, okay.
00:21:44 I've, I've heard from Michelle and I think from you.
00:21:47 Yeah.
00:21:48 That shower shampoo is a sham.
00:21:52 Oh.
00:21:53 And in some, like using it.
00:21:55 We are sponsored by Big Shamp.
00:21:56 I am.
00:21:57 I am being paid lots of money by Big Shamp to encourage people to sacrifice the precious,
00:22:02 precious oils down the drain.
00:22:05 Where, where the Big Shamp collects them to sell them back to you in more shampoo.
00:22:10 Yeah.
00:22:11 Talking, listen.
00:22:12 Me and Michelle are divided on this.
00:22:13 Talking about Big Shamp got Michelle banned off Twitter once.
00:22:15 So we should be careful what we say.
00:22:16 This video might get demonetized.
00:22:18 Yeah.
00:22:19 This channel might be, might be stricken from the record.
00:22:22 We just don't know.
00:22:23 We're at risk.
00:22:24 It might be cleaned up.
00:22:25 So, so, so I guess let me just say that when we say that a Big Shamp is stealing your oils,
00:22:31 what we mean is in Minecraft.
00:22:34 Correct.
00:22:35 Correct.
00:22:36 No real life inclinations whatsoever.
00:22:39 It's all an abstraction.
00:22:42 And it's, it's not.
00:22:45 Jeff Bezos.
00:22:46 You hear that?
00:22:47 You hear that Bill Gates?
00:22:48 I'm making mad bucks.
00:22:49 Please use my Amazon link to Amazon.com slash Big Shamp forward slash Nate's money.
00:22:56 Yeah.
00:22:57 That's the full URL.
00:22:59 Oh, here it goes.
00:23:01 Amazon.com slash Nate is in cahoots with Big Shamp.
00:23:04 Yeah.
00:23:05 Okay.
00:23:06 There you go.
00:23:07 That's cool.
00:23:08 Okay.
00:23:09 All right.
00:23:10 I'm done.
00:23:11 That's it.
00:23:12 Well, hey guys, you know, you know, when you're like thinking I'm going to be productive
00:23:17 or that'll be really cool if I'm productive or something today.
00:23:21 And instead, you have the stupidest possible idea that's kind of funny and you want to see
00:23:28 it and then you Google it to see if someone else has like saved you the trouble of doing
00:23:32 this really stupid thing.
00:23:35 And then you find out that they haven't done it and you are the only person to even have
00:23:39 considered this really stupid idea.
00:23:42 And so instead of being productive, you spend hours upon hours downloading nostalgia critic
00:23:48 videos so that you can link all of them together so that he can say hello and the nostalgia
00:23:54 critic every single time he does it in one video.
00:23:57 Cool.
00:23:58 Is the idea to have him say it like layer it on top of each other so like you hear him
00:24:04 say it every single time in one second or whatever.
00:24:06 I mean, I could do that as well, but I was just thinking of having like a super cut of
00:24:10 from the very first to the most recent, hello on the nostalgia critic.
00:24:14 That's classic Gibbs stuff.
00:24:15 You can't do it, dawg.
00:24:16 I've been doing it.
00:24:18 You know, Crip Converter, that is the really good YouTube download specifically for its
00:24:27 function to download only a portion of the video.
00:24:30 So download the first like minute or two.
00:24:32 Yeah, the first 10 seconds of each video contains the hello on the nostalgia critic.
00:24:37 So I'm not taking up a lot of hard drive space.
00:24:40 Don't a lot of them start with the later on they do, but you can you can you can choose
00:24:46 I can, you know, manually just choose the point where he says it.
00:24:50 And so I'm so instead of instead of working on my Tezuko manga project, which is something
00:24:55 that is much better.
00:24:57 I'm sensitive.
00:24:58 Yeah.
00:24:59 I have been I've been looking at nostalgia critic and I put it in the timeline just to
00:25:03 see like the first 38 episodes and I was I was really he was really funny.
00:25:09 Just he just says it over and over again and his his head wobbles a little more every time.
00:25:15 That sounds great.
00:25:18 I want to see it.
00:25:19 I'm looking forward to it.
00:25:20 He gradually low shed his inhibitions.
00:25:23 Yeah.
00:25:24 And you can you can see week to week that is like his sideburns grow and then he shaves
00:25:27 them off.
00:25:30 Something's really funny about watching it all in a line.
00:25:33 How many times does he has he said it?
00:25:35 How many times do you think he said it in his life?
00:25:38 How many thousands?
00:25:40 Probably near to like a thousand.
00:25:43 What do you think the nostalgia critics pee be on saying hello?
00:25:46 I'm the nostalgic critic is like what's his speed run time for saying those words?
00:25:50 I'm learning that he is.
00:25:52 He varies like initially he's sort of slow to calculate which one was the speed of the
00:25:58 video speeds up like his delivery sometimes when he's excited when he leads right into
00:26:03 another sentence.
00:26:04 Sometimes he's like says it in a depressed way but like I want to see the general trend
00:26:09 like could you plot on a graph how how it increases in speed over time or whether it
00:26:15 does you know this is all this is all science here.
00:26:18 This is going to be like a very scientific footage video for people to use and dissect.
00:26:23 I'm very excited.
00:26:26 How long do you think it's going to be?
00:26:28 What were they?
00:26:29 What are they?
00:26:30 I think he said.
00:26:31 Oh shit.
00:26:32 What were they thinking?
00:26:33 How long how long will the video be if you put if you were to put all of them back to
00:26:39 back?
00:26:40 I don't even know how many nostalgia critics he's done so I couldn't even park it but
00:26:45 are they not numbered?
00:26:46 I mean it's got to be a playlist.
00:26:47 They are numbered but like with seasons I'm looking on YouTube he's got like his older
00:26:53 episodes are uploaded in seasons season one season two which I think are just like yeah
00:26:59 thanks for watching this episode.
00:27:01 I'm sorry I'm making noise.
00:27:04 What was I saying?
00:27:05 You don't know how long it's going to be.
00:27:08 Yeah I mean it could end up being like 40 minutes or something ridiculous which would
00:27:12 be funny.
00:27:14 Oh just for fun I did wait oh wait is this a playlist of every ABGN season but each
00:27:21 one.
00:27:22 That would be one to watch on two time speed.
00:27:24 Indeed indeed but this one it's every ABGN season but I think each season is rendered
00:27:30 into one video so this doesn't help at all god damn it.
00:27:34 Interesting.
00:27:35 Oh no yeah.
00:27:36 Oof.
00:27:37 Yikes.
00:27:38 Oof bro.
00:27:39 Gonna have to scrub.
00:27:40 Oh you know what that reminds me that does in fact take me back to the past when I remember
00:27:46 when I did me a math of a one.
00:27:47 Wait wait that's the wrong guy Nostalgia Critic doesn't take you back to the past.
00:27:52 No no no I think I think Nate was saying that like a super cut of what were they thinking.
00:27:58 What were they thinking.
00:28:00 I think I think he only says it like about 10 times I don't think he says it quite as
00:28:05 much.
00:28:06 Yeah yeah.
00:28:07 He just sort of like because it recurs it's just something that people remember.
00:28:11 I think he starts to say it more often and then maybe less often it kind of there's probably
00:28:16 like a sort of like a there's a period and fall much much like the much like the infection
00:28:21 curve of the COVID-19 pandemic.
00:28:24 Oh indeed indeed once wrote down my thoughts in a notepad document of of the ABGN like
00:28:32 eras like which ones were good basically I mean I'm trying to look for it but the basic
00:28:39 just is it's good and then he's working on the movie and it's bad and then it's sort
00:28:43 of good no it's good again sort of hit and miss.
00:28:47 I rewatched every season for some I just put them on and let them play like not that long
00:28:53 ago.
00:28:54 I don't know if I mentioned this before I feel like it was kind of you know a waste
00:29:01 of time but what did I expect you know.
00:29:06 Let me hey my point I was saying before it was just that a guy when I made me a math
00:29:10 of a one like four years ago a dude says it said if you do this I will make a video putting
00:29:18 all these together.
00:29:19 Now at the time I was like oh well I would kind of like rather post that myself I don't
00:29:23 know I mean maybe I'll do that but but just for the record he did not do that so that
00:29:28 guy is a pussy ass bitch and I did succeed so fuck that guy little bitch okay I'm looking
00:29:35 at my document from 2007 to 2010 is the AVGN golden era where basically every episode is
00:29:41 like a peak classic AVGN screaming you can't go wrong 2011 he starts working on the film
00:29:49 and then 2012-2013.
00:29:50 Guys that was that long ago yeah 2011 to 2014 it's like movie era where there's not
00:29:58 so much happening.
00:29:59 Dude feel old yet the AVGN movie can vote can fucking fight and die overseas yeah nine
00:30:06 years old yeah.
00:30:08 I think he really hit his stride somewhere between 2001 September 10th and 2001 September
00:30:15 12th there was just a sweet spot right there where he was really you know knocking it out
00:30:19 of the park knocking it all the way down wait guys please back me up please yes wait wait
00:30:28 I didn't know is that a 9-11 joke I missed it yeah of course it was okay how was that
00:30:34 not cuz I was looking at what numbers are Nate you understand this you know who'd back
00:30:39 me up I say it backwards I say 11-9 Sheldon would have backed me up.
00:30:44 Bazinga.
00:30:45 Alright well I still have just not watched this motherfucker more than like three episodes
00:30:52 one day maybe I don't know what the big bang theory the AVGN the AVGN or 9-11 bin lad same
00:31:02 guy same guy same energy hey here's a here's a new development in the red manosphere the
00:31:10 gibbosphere the whatever the fuck yeah yeah yeah yeah gun girls Antifa now yeah that was
00:31:17 my favorite thing now I don't know it's hard hard to say a lot of a lot of cool shit happened
00:31:22 this week but that was pretty based Antifa gun girl brings a smile to my face it's it's
00:31:28 so perfect for our character because she's always been like hates authority to the point
00:31:32 of like ridiculousness and it just so happens that she's a right-wing gun nut in order to
00:31:38 get the guns to do so because the girls is based on I was thinking she could be a right-wing
00:31:45 gun nut because she's gun girl and but she's also a cab she's also yeah Antifa because
00:31:52 fat cops cop killer you know yeah yeah she's not she's not open carry she's open fire
00:32:02 open shell casing when they I literally for some reason I just cannot hear you talking
00:32:06 at all for the last like minute am I really quiet or something is there's something for
00:32:09 me you were but maybe it's just me I don't know I don't know my thing looks okay can
00:32:15 you hear me now let me give you one of those okay cool how about one of these I heard that
00:32:25 brother your your soundboard is so much louder than you are is it really well I'll work on
00:32:31 it you're not leaning into the mic enough or something I like I like to write up on this
00:32:36 bitch I don't know I liked I liked seeing I liked seeing a pro pro protest and black lives
00:32:43 matter stuff from most of us I like I liked seeing it from hippo I like seeing it from
00:32:49 Tom also based who else was doing it Munchie hasn't been on Twitter Munchie was on the
00:32:56 video deafening silence over from over from Nate over here Digi sort of pro but like
00:33:03 in a weird way that you can't quite understand what she's saying we've all we've all we're
00:33:09 all in this together all right that's that's politics is beneath me no I don't I don't like
00:33:20 I don't like Japanese animated what is this voice much I don't know if this is a voice
00:33:35 modulator or soundboard okay it's me it's Megatron it's Megatron that's all that's yep
00:33:46 I like I like Megatron Megatron do you think black lives matter yeah Megatron
00:33:51 of course not that's so bad of you how come on knock was like to this prime he needs to
00:34:06 come in here shit set you straight is the kind of folk don't that there's no Megatron that
00:34:12 turns into like a human meanwhile meanwhile Optimus Prime couldn't be on the show because
00:34:21 he's at he's at the protests he's social distancing he's wearing his mask you know he's holding
00:34:27 up a big he's holding up a black lives matter he's turned into a fucking truck and he's mowing
00:34:32 police barricade as we speak they're throwing tear gas in his windows the police are breaking
00:34:44 his windows and putting little handcuffs on his little wheels or whatever dude it's not it's
00:34:54 not good to run people over but Optimus Prime supports looting Megatron I don't like where
00:35:11 you go I don't like some of the implications of what you're saying right now all all lives matter
00:35:17 Megatron even human lives stop it we're gonna cancel the old spark we're gonna get rid of the
00:35:33 all spark is an all right dog whistle Donald Trump has declared the Autobots and a terrorist
00:35:48 organization this is starting to seem just like a like a gray alien speaking to me what
00:36:03 in the Michael Bay movies all fucking Autobots all Transformers are just gray they're just
00:36:18 weird gray masses so gray gray lives matter hey Megatron I fucking don't like your attitude
00:36:32 and if I saw the all spark I wouldn't even let you know about it I would say
00:37:03 the culture of the police in America shifted irreparably when the Decepticons arrived on
00:37:07 America scanned to determine who you know the most easily infiltrated authority figures were
00:37:13 decided they were police all those Decepticons became police cars when you see a police car on
00:37:18 the street it's a Decepticon smash each window report it to your local Autobot a splinter
00:37:25 terrorists sell they'll know what to do
00:37:28 they're terrorists because they have the all spark but we will attain it when they claim they claim
00:37:34 that there's no leadership but I know that their leaders have the all spark and we will find them
00:37:40 and we will make our Decepticons supreme uh uh uh uh uh so don't forget to vote Republican kids
00:37:50 for more Decepticons we we got a we got a deep platform this guy this guy is spouting this is
00:37:56 hate speech uh this is unacceptable um this is this is uh but he's got the robot card though
00:38:03 propaganda no no that's identity politics don't give in don't give in he's co-opting
00:38:08 he's recuperating liberal he's recuperating liberal identity politics to to undermine solidarity
00:38:16 uh
00:38:21 incredible oh he's still here
00:38:29 no i can't just cover your ears everyone just don't just don't let it in just don't let it
00:38:38 don't let it okay no more all spark no message received thank you megatron thanks
00:38:49 thanks megatron thanks for coming on the show yeah what if you wanted these you tell what i've
00:38:54 told you we needed guests yeah we needed guests and we got them thank thank you
00:39:00 that was great we appreciate uh ladies and gentlemen we got them yes
00:39:10 okay all right yes good speaking of guests speaking of guests we were uh of me
00:39:17 me we we we good pzp members uh uh we were a guest on vik and hope stream uh vik contacted us to do
00:39:27 a charity stream and we raised over a thousand dollars for the for the for the uh richmond bail
00:39:34 fund uh this was this was yesterday uh it was really good and real cool and they played
00:39:41 sonic adventure 2 for 10 hours i was on the i didn't realize um i i'd left before and i i went
00:39:51 back to to watch the remainder um that like a bail is around a thousand bucks i didn't think it was
00:39:59 that high either to to just like it seems like a surprising very obviously like restrictive amount
00:40:06 of money yeah like like it's so obvious where like the point of it is it's pretty yeah cash bail
00:40:13 really is a fucked up is a fucked up thing that should be abolished haha fuck the police i can't
00:40:18 remember the the exact rates but like i remember hearing something that seemed very strange to me
00:40:23 about like uh okay you criminal we're sentencing you i don't know what the person did but like it
00:40:27 was like okay you'll get it was like a like month in jail or like it was like something like a
00:40:33 ten thousand dollar fine and i was like i'll take the month in jail where between those two things
00:40:39 jesus christ well we're not we're not talking about fines we're not talking about paying right
00:40:44 separate fines we're talking about cash bail like to release do people their point do people know
00:40:50 like i feel like there are some people don't understand this because i think a lot of countries
00:40:56 don't have cash bail and even in america where we do have it i think that a lot of people don't
00:41:01 quite understand how it works well all right for anyone who doesn't know cash bail is like you get
00:41:07 arrested you go to jail and then there is like a process of like where they have to like i don't
00:41:12 know file for your trial and like await your actual trial to determine your guilt and most of the time
00:41:19 they will let you leave jail to um you know and you just have to come back for your trial um but
00:41:26 in a lot of in most cases they will have something called bail which is you basically have to post
00:41:32 an amount of money that is determined like based on how what you're accused of like different crimes
00:41:37 have different bail amounts and you have to put up that money as collateral and then once you do that
00:41:44 you know then it's like okay we'll keep that and then you show up for trial and you get it back
00:41:48 right so like i guess the idea behind it is that like well the worst thing you're accused of the
00:41:56 more you have to post bail because it's like a higher stakes thing i guess it's theoretically it's
00:42:03 to like be more of a deterrent for people fleeing harsher sentences or something in
00:42:08 in practice it is just a it is just a barrier that like you know uh poor people of which there are
00:42:16 a lot of just can't pay even the smallest amount of and a lot of people you know you know what they
00:42:21 always said like during the during the fucking uh uh primary uh race for the elections we heard all
00:42:28 the time that like the average american family can't uh like pay a sudden five up five hundred
00:42:34 dollar uh expense and so you know bail is usually it's like that that would be pretty small for
00:42:40 bail so like a lot of crimes is there a reasonable alternative what's uh what's there is there is a
00:42:44 reasonable alternative and funnily enough it's nothing because um there is there is like no
00:42:53 data does not suggest that cash bail actually works as a as a deterrent for flight because like
00:43:00 not showing up for your trial like is illegal and is another crime that you can then be charged with
00:43:07 uh um and cash bail just doesn't work and so so the real issue here is simply that and the one
00:43:14 last thing effectively as a just oh yeah gone gone uh and the justification i would say is that like
00:43:19 if a crime if if you are if you are not a flight risk to the point that like any amount of just
00:43:25 like money can be just sort of handed over and like they'll just trust you to come back for it
00:43:32 then like letting you go without that i don't know like then if you can be allowed outside
00:43:39 at all awaiting your trial then they should probably just let you go and do it yeah can you
00:43:44 if if something if something is a if something is a like a heinous enough crime or enough of a
00:43:48 flight risk that they shouldn't be letting you out of jail even for money then like they shouldn't
00:43:54 let you do it for money you know yeah like if i mean i don't know how it works but like if say
00:44:01 you're accused of murder like suspected of murder they shouldn't let you out even if you have the
00:44:07 money right i don't think i'm pretty i'm pretty sure they something like that probably doesn't
00:44:12 allow for bail yeah i think i don't know for sure but like not every crime not every charge
00:44:18 allows is like yeah you can be held without bail awaiting trial the thing about it is the cash
00:44:23 bail system if someone can't paste their bail then they might just have to sit in jail for days or
00:44:30 weeks or months or who knows how long uh awaiting their trial which would cause them to lose their
00:44:36 job miss uh you know miss payments on their house possibly get evicted from their home
00:44:42 all because they couldn't post that initial like bail payment which happens all the time
00:44:46 and what that leads to is people uh accepting plea bargains uh even when they're you know accepting
00:44:53 like un like unjustly long like sentences as part of a plea bargain just so that they can get it done
00:44:59 and get out of you know jail awaiting trial so that they can go back to their job and not lose
00:45:04 their job not lose their home or whatever this happens all the time this is like one of the
00:45:09 tactics that has led to the like the ballooning of the of the of the like the prison population
00:45:14 in the last like 40 years uh and that's part of the problem and that's why and the thing about
00:45:21 a bail fund right which is what we were raising money for on on the the the vican hope stream
00:45:27 was like if you give to a fund like that what i think is really cool about it is that they will
00:45:32 they post bail for someone but then when that person goes back to trial they do get the bit
00:45:36 get the money back and then they can use it again to post bail for someone else so this is just like
00:45:41 a fund of money that that this organization now has to like keep people out of that situation
00:45:46 i just described you know in the future going forward like this is not just going to be something
00:45:52 that's used for relief during like arrests in the wake of the protests like the cash bail thing is
00:45:57 always a problem it's not just right now although for right now i think a lot of these organizations
00:46:01 are focusing on keeping protesters out of jail which is good um anyway that was that was pretty
00:46:08 based um oh speaking of that unless anyone else has anything to say because i this was
00:46:16 uh separate from the separate from that stream which was giving to the for the Richmond fund
00:46:21 i i donated to my my the massachusetts fund and because i did that and then with the help of a
00:46:28 little guy of a guy uh uh by the name of uh uh cuttle sol or or cicada um did you see that tweet

00:53:44 see i wish this was ranked in terms of who's the worst trader i would like to know but that would
00:53:49 be pretty hard because it seems like this guy does not vet his list very well uh chugga conroy
00:53:56 youtuber chris ray gun chucky chevy chase parentheses comedic icon uh where is hypocrite
00:54:05 where's give and take that's not that game grumps there they are the threshold of trader is uh
00:54:10 that's i'd love him to define i think it's just like lil nas x black lives do matter
00:54:15 then you're a trader to america that's literally i'm safe thank god if you if you tweet if you
00:54:21 tweet anything about black lives matter or probably just like anything
00:54:26 progressive at all probably and he was in the right mood i'm sure there's no like hard line of
00:54:30 like what gets you on the list or what doesn't i don't know i suspect you're right uh but supposedly
00:54:36 it's about supporting uh the protest or whatever because we the list start he explains it at the
00:54:41 top let me read here a number of individuals companies outlets and media institutions have
00:54:46 stepped forward to announce that they support the groups enabling riots violence vandalism theft
00:54:50 assault and murder dab taking place at the hands of vandals and thugs across the united states of
00:54:56 america and even looking to find out which companies brands and content creators have
00:54:59 betrayed the trust of the american people by aligning with groups that support the destruction of
00:55:03 uh western values uh this list will enlighten you as to who the traders are so you can stay
00:55:10 informed there it is it'll be informed not yep this is journalism what we're looking at is journalism
00:55:18 and they said all games journalism was bad and western value this is what i call in the trend
00:55:22 this is what i would call ethical games journalism uh where i forced to point out an example
00:55:30 which in these modern days i feel like i am constantly these feminists sparking at the door
00:55:37 discord i'm howling at the moon
00:55:50 megatron get out of here buddy is megatron a brony i think he probably is he's got definitely
00:55:57 he's got the look in his eye they're both hasbro products don't you know oh you brand connection
00:56:04 they're probably best friends i wonder if there was ever a transformer uh in in the
00:56:09 friendship is magic there's gotta be some reference i mean that's a fucking those boys are in deep
00:56:14 dude do you think there's a transformer
00:56:17 hmm uh no
00:56:23 like a transition or are they all by definition trans they're all non but wait actually i suppose
00:56:28 they are binary unless they're those kinds like optimists that have multiple forms uh you know
00:56:33 i feel like this might vary from canon to canon do do do do they have a gender like before they
00:56:41 come to earth i don't there are clearly female seeming in the old robots on earth right in the
00:56:48 old cartoon there were like okay they they don't they like they like take their form when they get
00:56:58 to earth right well but the form that they take is actually usually like like optimus was a fire
00:57:03 truck yeah because there's a fire truck i think he already looked like normal humanoid optimus
00:57:07 his normal humanoid optimus is like his normal like off world form like that's what he looked
00:57:12 like before informed by the fire truck this is like elements of that in the design clearly yeah
00:57:18 this is a host of juju situation yeah um i i feel like i feel like they i'm i'm i think they have
00:57:32 a fucking i think there are girl autobots which means there are guy autobots or
00:57:38 like before like before because from the cartoon which means which means that they have gender
00:57:48 but i don't know if they can be but are they assigned a gender at birth right you have to be
00:57:54 you have to be assigned a gender at birth to then become trans by changing your it you know
00:58:01 we don't know the anatomy there could theoretically be some sort of gender
00:58:04 since i am sure they don't have fucking dicks and p-holes they are probably not assigned to the
00:58:10 gender at birth the two sexes dicks or p-holes and therefore i don't think they can be trans
00:58:15 oh wait now that is true this is my i see i see any any any fucking hey what's the generic word
00:58:23 for an autobot or like a member of the species that is either a an autobot or a decepticon the
00:58:27 only thing that comes to mind is transformer but i don't know if that's actually legit or not
00:58:32 okay uh wait they're from no wait they're from a planet right robot what's the name of their
00:58:37 planet or they're they're cute oh shit i should know that they're from a big fucking hyper cube
00:58:42 in space right big minecraft flick there is a name for it there was a show called like uh
00:58:48 transformers colon something and it was like the name of that because it took place on there like
00:58:52 after everyone was fucking dead uh oh i can't remember mega trans formers yeah home home planet
00:59:00 is called yeah cybertron i don't know this cybertron so maybe they're like cybertronians
00:59:07 or something that would make that would make sense but then again would every like if you're
00:59:11 like a deer and you're brought from earth somewhere are you an earthling or are you like a deer you
00:59:15 know is it like what's the sub category there i think you're you're both well i think i mean
00:59:20 you're both i think that the only thing that lives on cybertron are the these things well at this
00:59:28 point that's definitely like like it like if you are from thank if you are like i don't think they
00:59:33 like also have like others like native species i think it's just this one kind of being comes from
00:59:39 this thing uh yeah yeah maybe it's not even uh maybe it's an artificial planet created by someone
00:59:45 it looks like that it doesn't look like a normal uh uh place it's like a big fucking like spherical
00:59:53 like clockwork thing well i gotta google it it's like it's like it looks like um it looks like
00:59:59 fucking uh uh uh coruscant but like that's also been hollowed out and like the inside of it is more
01:00:05 coruscant but you know is is that hard to believe that uh over time this civilization could have
01:00:11 hollowed out their planet because they don't need you know it could have been i don't know i just
01:00:15 kind of it doesn't feel right like these like i'm pretty sure that they that these cybertronians
01:00:21 don't have like a biological origin but maybe well i mean maybe like they were created by
01:00:27 like originally but you know not not their specific maybe i don't know maybe not maybe not
01:00:32 maybe the all spark just sprang from the nothingness maybe maybe uh uh well let's see where did
01:00:38 where did cybertron where did cybertron come from i don't know is there a wiki i bet there's a
01:00:44 fucking i'm sure we gotta talk to victor cybertron planet us up i think wiki uh uh general uh
01:00:51 marvel comics cybertron was a was the what was the adopted form of the lord of the light gods
01:00:58 primus who trapped himself and unicorn in baron asteroids it's a god trapped in an asteroid
01:01:07 which or a does a marvel or a multitude of gods which they then shaped in their physical forms
01:01:12 while unicron turned his prison into a transformable humanoid body primus reformed himself into a vast
01:01:17 Saturn sized machine world home for a robotic race he created to fight unicron with similar
01:01:22 transformation abilities okay all right there you go it's just a god manifesting as a as a machine
01:01:30 sphere gave birth to a species uh yeah all right there it is now at least according to this now we
01:01:38 know if they all agree on that i know unicron is no that's just the first one that's the first one
01:01:44 from the marvel comics continuity okay from the cartoon um oh okay yeah um 12 million years ago
01:01:56 no that's that's later okay i guess maybe they maybe they don't go into where it comes from
01:02:04 in the real quick just listen to this sorry okay this is this could we could probably spend the
01:02:08 rest of the episode just talking about uh transformers canon please don't indeed okay let me leave
01:02:13 you with this one detail no i went so that that second god or whatever unicron i just went to his
01:02:18 wiki page on the transformers wiki and this is the description at the top of the page quote
01:02:24 a unicron or lots of unicrons did lots of stuff in the primex universal cluster it's not all very
01:02:31 clear primex that is the description universal cluster okay and then on the right there's a
01:02:36 there's a cool picture of unicron which is captioned with i usually don't look nearly
01:02:40 as cool as this as he holds the planet earth in his hand um who's writing this uh all right
01:02:46 they're not taking this very seriously that's from the transformers yeah yeah the tf wiki.net
01:02:53 which sounds authoritative i mean what article i linked the unicron article unicron in generation
01:02:59 one oh okay well this is gonna have all kinds of the oh wait which is distinct from the main
01:03:06 there's a main unicron that was generation one the the cybertron article is much more professional
01:03:14 unicron's main page it because cybertron is the home planet of the transformers and usually the
01:03:18 body of their creator primus cybertron is blah blah blah blah blah okay you know what on the main
01:03:23 one let me just say unicron is the eternal arch enemy of his twin brother primus also known as
01:03:28 the lord of chaos the chaos bringer the planet eater blah blah blah blah blah there you go he
01:03:30 wants to consume the multiverse understood thank you but would they say trans rights though
01:03:38 i don't think they would i think they're cowards but they say they'd say transformers
01:03:42 transformers rights no not good enough they're recuperating it
01:03:49 it's an alt right dog whistle on this wiki there's a lot of shit going on here uh all right well in
01:03:54 any case um i just let you know i've got a voicemail unless uh you guys want to uh let me go for an
01:04:01 hour i i got a thing a little little thing to talk about speaking of being a traitor to america
01:04:07 to traitor to western values uh i've decided my punk only fans is doing well uh it's really funny
01:04:15 um that's there's a brand new image set of punk showing her gourds like you get to see them for
01:04:23 real saw it damn how did i see that wait did you post it in a discord server and that's how i saw it
01:04:29 it was that's costing yourself my business yeah costing her my business you're a leaker
01:04:34 i did that well it was just you munchy me and kazi yeah but i've decided because most of those
01:04:43 people because the only fans is five bucks a month i'm going to consolidate that into my patreon
01:04:49 because patreon takes less of a cut than only fans does only fans is kind of i see kind of a
01:04:54 shit kind of an asshole what kind of percentage like ten percent less more um all right it's one
01:05:02 fifth i think twenty percent yeah so what so what you're saying is that these images are also
01:05:07 going to be available on your patreon yes at the five dollar exclusively yes good so so if you want
01:05:14 that you you got it i must now give i have been pondering this does this do these images inform
01:05:23 pumps uh canon like idea like is this canon pump it must be you know alt universe i don't know it
01:05:29 could be could be just uh um like is all porn of every anime character canon i mean you know i mean
01:05:35 if i'm just curious if the creator of the character is making it and it's like all done in character
01:05:41 then and i would then i would say i would assume that i would i would assume that it is canon until
01:05:47 notified otherwise well yeah that's why i'm asking the thing about it right is that
01:05:52 punk is a vegetable i don't want to follow no slut i don't want to know so cheap ass bitch ass
01:05:58 he thought well that's what that's what she is i'm sorry punk is a is a vegetable and and not a
01:06:06 mammal and so uh the things that are attractive about human females and males she doesn't understand
01:06:12 she doesn't care so it's like it's like doing this stuff isn't even sexual she doesn't even
01:06:19 understand she's like how these idiots have given me money that is like the the canon character
01:06:23 interpretation so she's not being slow that's why she's just doing stuff it seems like she's being
01:06:29 a slut but uh in fact we are we are incorrect what does what does constitute a sexual display
01:06:38 spilling your pumpkin guts you know it would be it would be on the inside no no no no showing her
01:06:42 stamen no it would it would be it would be things like uh pollination like bees yeah yeah yeah
01:06:49 like like plant things like showing her roots the stamen yeah yeah yeah yeah the seed her seed
01:06:56 pods she is like if you give her a bouquet of roses she will get like super blush like oh my god
01:07:04 i can't believe you would do this like you fucking pervert she throws them back at you these are just
01:07:09 like a handful of good joker china's you've handed me now remember all those absolutely
01:07:14 hilarious bucket jokes in homestack yeah row the potential is this is this is this is the the angle
01:07:22 i'm going for okay i got you i got you i mean obviously it started as a joke and it's not going
01:07:27 to be like a running thing when punk has her like uh return as a canon character in a comic which will
01:07:35 happen punk too uh you hold the camera during my only fan shoot uh yes thank aliex takes the pictures
01:07:42 on our phone aliex aliex getting all the money punk's just right yeah but yeah that's that's
01:07:49 that's about that go to go to patreon dot com slash give and take yeah probably do that
01:07:55 sounds seems like a good idea like a plant um i got some i bought some more worm stuff
01:08:05 yeah just yet yesterday yesterday okay i bought like a big shipment of the isomalta oligosaccharides
01:08:12 which as you as i've said many times is the main ingredient in my um in my uh fucking uh the worms

01:09:49 rosy tinted like a sort of translucent black color to the drink and i was drinking it and i was like
01:09:55 this is amazing this tastes fantastic i'm gonna make i would make like black rose flavor right
01:10:02 they'd be like rose flavor but i'd dye them black that would be the the the flavor of that worm
01:10:06 ah right and it'd be like yeah it's like animal crossing um epic i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i
01:10:13 i guess this is like imagine i guess this is my new thing i guess this is my new like hobby or
01:10:17 whatever is like i i should get i should get different molds i should get more molds it's
01:10:22 yeah fish molds because like they have i try make it like hmm how can i make them how can i make
01:10:29 their consistency more like swedish fish how can i make their consistency more like a fruit roll up
01:10:34 how can i make their consistency more like this or that or the other thing product we just pecked
01:10:38 and do it just carrageen and do it what even are these things perhaps we could perhaps we
01:10:42 collab been and when i finished making my latest plaster mold uh for measuring my you know square
01:10:48 inches of surface area for my speedrun categories i thought you were gonna say dick make myself that
01:10:53 too dick will be part of the equation it will be part of the equation okay so you can fill that
01:10:58 up with your goo and we could make a nate mold maybe you know we could like it's you like just
01:11:02 posing like the statue of david or something and i just like fill that yes fill it up with like
01:11:07 pounds and pounds of this weird of this weird shit and then we can all eat it together
01:11:12 we can all like descend upon it and take bites out of it uh devour nate as you reach the dessert
01:11:18 cool what flavor do you want to be excellent uh i guess some sort of like lime yeah lime green
01:11:24 is good you want to be like let like lemon lime maybe yes that would be great maybe i can mix up
01:11:28 some kind of like citrusy like mountain dewy kind of flavor or something yeah i mean my favorite
01:11:33 has always been orange but lemon lime is good for the for the color aesthetic so i like that okay
01:11:39 well we can have oh oh oh there's i saw what was that other the the company i was ordering flavor
01:11:45 i've had like a flavor that was like a particular kind of orange but i i can't there is things like
01:11:51 blood oranges one i love blood orange wait wait wait wait um um can i i gotta find it i
01:11:58 i think it was the product where is the where is the product no uh i'll say while you do that
01:12:05 yeah i love blood orange mochi which i have had at Whole Foods uh every other mochi is so much worse
01:12:13 than the blood orange mochi including mango which masquerades really if it was the orange equivalent
01:12:20 really blood orange is so i mean hey everyone's got their own taste but this is like like there's
01:12:25 chocolate lame gay not cool blood orange is the best uh that's my expert opinion if you go to
01:12:32 Whole Foods you get those that's the one i highly recommend sometimes i'll want to be like oh i should
01:12:37 get like you know get like six of them i'll mix and match every time i'm disappointed when i'm
01:12:42 eating one that isn't blood orange just get six blood orange it's the way to go sounds delicious
01:12:48 and not highly recommend it at all no not keto at all no no no bur burgamut
01:12:56 burgamut haven't heard of it burgamut orange i hadn't either but it's some kind of like little
01:13:00 like green orange it's an orange even though it's green hey go figure am i right imagine that i
01:13:08 should have orange is a green until they should have got oh i forgot i should have got rice flour
01:13:12 because like i think i wouldn't i wouldn't use a lot of it because it's not keto it's not but if
01:13:17 you just use a little bit of it for like consistency next next time i go on a spree of like buying weird
01:13:22 shit i'll i'll get like a little a little bag of of of rice flour just just to just to like sprinkle
01:13:30 in just just see what just see what i because that's the main ingredient mochi right uh yes that's
01:13:35 right that's right yeah so you know pounded rice whatever i think i just pound rice or at least
01:13:40 in the old days i'm sure it's more complex i think there's uh there's really just pounded like with
01:13:45 hammers yeah i mean back in i mean i'm like a very inefficient way to make flour well this is a
01:13:52 historical like like an ancient technique technique of yeah they have like a very deep bowl i mean
01:13:57 mochi it's like it's like an art that people used to there were like artisans who specialized in
01:14:01 mochi back in the day yeah sure yeah cool okay indeed i noticed gib left by the way don't know
01:14:09 what's going on with that wait he did oh he i mean he yeah he just disappeared i don't know why
01:14:14 maybe um maybe his like he's got a no i was gonna say he's got a thing on his computer that like
01:14:18 turns off his internet at a certain time in the evening it's a little before that i think it has
01:14:23 caused him to uh spontaneously vanish from streams and the like before but probably it's not late
01:14:30 enough wait no oh yeah yeah well no it would be nine you can reach his like total amount of computer
01:14:36 usage time for a day i think and that might be i mean maybe maybe but i don't know but if that were
01:14:42 the case he it would be he would be leaving if it were time base he would have left at like
01:14:48 nine twenty five p.m. or so which just doesn't seem very like something like that um so probably
01:14:54 not that what else would have on my list oh i um i've been making pizza but making keto pizza
01:15:01 why did i put that on the list i did a tweet okay i did a tweet about a pizza image i saw that i
01:15:06 wanted to make and i asked the people to give me their pizza recipes yeah which i will ask for
01:15:10 again here i'll link the tweet to people uh because i want to eat this specific kind of pizza uh
01:15:15 because it just looked so good i think it's just like a like a thin crust margarita pizza yes and
01:15:20 i uh want to make it it looks like it's great rt some kind of artisanal uh freaking um definitely
01:15:26 a margarita hey what happened uh internet cut out lol we were mocking you as if it was your
01:15:32 like oh he reached his time yeah it was it was the it was the time limit it was the the the too late
01:15:38 to stream the cold turkey it's 4 30 time for your dick flattening sun get in here it's time for
01:15:43 my going to bed flattening my brain flattening that that crust that crust looks really good it
01:15:54 reminds me of papa geno's yeah people were saying did you work at a pizza it's similar
01:16:00 i'm sure this is better than papa geno's but it's got that same sort of like
01:16:03 bready bubbly crust consistency that's i really like that's my favorite yeah my favorite i want
01:16:09 this shit i'ma make it one of these days uh when i get around i definitely want to be able to make
01:16:13 that pizza bread that is my favorite right is when when it's like authentic italian um restaurant
01:16:20 like pizza that is like fresh from zeovin like uh like yeah whatever the what do they use the giant
01:16:27 oh here's the questions and the and the big uh the big like the big like paddles yeah yeah
01:16:32 have do you guys have any experience with a pizza stone because i think that a pizza stone
01:16:36 is the answer to getting the crispiness in this kind of way because i need like a hotter amount of
01:16:41 probably the really fancy boys make their pizza on a pizza stone yeah i was looking around it's
01:16:47 like 30 to 40 bucks so like not exactly cheap but i might like hit up a thrift store and see if i
01:16:50 can just find one that's like five bucks or something do you just like take the trays out
01:16:55 of your oven and put a pizza stone in there no you you put it on i mean okay you just put a
01:17:00 stone in there and it heats up for a long time and that makes it like i think generally it retains
01:17:04 heat really well so it gets hotter i think the idea is that it heats evenly or something because
01:17:09 like of the okay like the the the conductivity of the pizza stone or whatever i think that's
01:17:15 what that's the reason why it's it's different from like a pan and people are telling me this
01:17:21 is the way to go and i'm willing to invest because i want to give the shot i mean if you want if
01:17:25 you're wanting to make deliciosa authentic italian style pizza i mean indeed seems seems like the
01:17:32 pros use a stone but i don't know could be a could be a spook could all be a scam could be a sigh it
01:17:39 would be worth trying to just get the dough really good and then putting it in the oven and if the
01:17:43 oven is the problem then then you get the stone yeah you know that's a reasonable idea i'm gonna
01:17:49 i'm gonna do some experimenting i want i want this to be a thing i do oh it does this looks so good
01:17:54 like the i mean i would probably put more sauce honestly because i love sauce but just like little
01:17:57 bits of cheese the leaves the incredibly crispy thin crust yeah i'm god damn it's driving me wild
01:18:05 one day one day oh and you know what on this front some people are like nat what about your diet
01:18:09 or something i've actually been so fucking good about exercising the last two weeks and uh well
01:18:14 not counting my calories every single time but uh been better good on my diet and i counted them all
01:18:19 today i'm doing it again so shut the fuck up everybody i got it under control i can make a
01:18:24 pizza once in a while and it will not break the bank feels good though i've been feeling great
01:18:28 like break the bank no need for yoga my my profit margins are so razor thin i can't i can't afford
01:18:33 i can't afford a authentic uh a ball maza mozzarella i can't afford instead of i can't sit
01:18:41 of a grandma's heart surgery i have to get this pizza stone bro it was one of the other and
01:18:46 she would want me to live well rather than her she wouldn't want to live in a world where i can't
01:18:50 enjoy the authentic break of an experience just like in the old country precisely then
01:18:58 a grandma you say in front of her tombstone as you chow down
01:19:03 it's like cough coronavirus into her face epic simply epic grand mazinga
01:19:13 cool um yep so that's my quest i'll get back to you on that so this will be my gummy bear thing i
01:19:18 guess i have one more thing i could talk about from this week which is i played i played dnd again
01:19:23 the further adventures of higgs ozaks the dry um the frog man uh and how's he doing uh the thing
01:19:31 about we we had like a pretty long sesh this was this was on saturday i think and um the thing
01:19:38 about it is that the entire it was like all just arguing it was like we did have a fight but it was
01:19:45 like the the fight maybe lasted like like 45 minutes it was like three and a half hours of just arguing
01:19:51 about no we should join the mage's guild no we shouldn't join the mage's guild no we should we
01:19:56 should go to ice wall no we should go to junction no we should go this other place
01:20:01 or no we should we it was just it was just uh you know that's that's the experience that's
01:20:07 that's what it's all about i guess that's the tabletop life baby uh i mean i guess it was fine
01:20:15 i guess it wasn't too annoying i'm not i'm not even trying to complain i'm just saying it's funny
01:20:20 that this is this is what this is what the really the nuts and bolts of it boils down to
01:20:25 is just like and i'm just and i'm just over here i gotta tell you i gotta tell you i have
01:20:31 this is separate from talking about the the game in in specific but in general i have the
01:20:37 hugest pet peeve and a bunch of my fellow players do it and i it is like really hard for me not to
01:20:43 get like annoyed it is really hard for me not to like say something sometimes and be a dick because
01:20:49 i know no one wants to hear it because i guess it's just a preference but my preference is better
01:20:55 and everyone who disagrees is fucking stupid and playing the game wrong um i hate it when a player
01:21:01 will like will like want to do something right like they want to like maybe they want to look
01:21:07 for something like they think they might they think they might like want to look for some
01:21:14 somewhere because they think they will find something like in a room or whatever and they say
01:21:19 can i roll for perception to find x like if they want to find a clue it's like
01:21:24 can i roll for perception to find a clue i i hate that so much but what what you're supposed to do
01:21:31 in my opinion and i kind of think that anyone who has a different opinion is just wrong and not
01:21:36 valid is you're supposed to say okay well i'm gonna investigate the room i think maybe i'll find
01:21:44 this right you might even not have to add that last part i kind of think even that's a little
01:21:49 bit leading maybe you should just say okay i'm gonna investigate the room i'm gonna look for
01:21:54 stuff what do i find right you don't say when my when my fellow party members pick up the die
01:22:03 on their own when the dm did not tell them to and they say i'm gonna i want to make like a um
01:22:08 i want to make like a uh uh i want to make a insight check like to see if he's lying it's like no
01:22:19 you if ideally the dm would say make an insight check on their own and you would and then you
01:22:26 would roll and then they would tell you if they're lying or maybe if they don't do it maybe you just
01:22:30 say hmm does he sound sincere do i think he's lying and then the dm would say make a roll
01:22:36 and then you would do that and then they'd say yes you do or no you don't or you're not sure
01:22:42 that's the way you do it everything else is wrong and ruins the game okay my favorite is when i you
01:22:48 just you're like i'm gonna do this instantly rolls dice for anyone can say anything i got a 20 i win
01:22:53 it should be i will really strongly feel like 100 of the time you roll the dice when the dm
01:22:59 tells you to when the dm tells you a roll is required and at no other time yeah that makes
01:23:06 okay let me get this straight so like if some character's talking and it's never up to you
01:23:11 what role you're making the dm tells you what role you don't say can i make a perception check no
01:23:16 you can make one of those if the dm says make a perception check jesus christ so so like there's
01:23:22 a character talking and i i'm being in character and i think he's probably lying so i say out loud
01:23:29 i don't trust this guy um and the dm would say well roll to see if you can like how would that
01:23:36 work should i you would say that should i not say a declarative statement no you can you can say that
01:23:42 i mean i guess you could say that it would probably be a little more effective it'd probably be a
01:23:48 little more helpful to say to ask the dm for clarification like do i think he's lying does
01:23:54 it sound like he's lying or even just even just is he lying because the answer to that is make a
01:24:00 perception check or make an insight check um uh you that's that's how you should do it the there's
01:24:06 just i really think that it is an i just really think it is overstepping a player bounds to be
01:24:12 deciding what roles they want to make that's not their job and i think then remember when i really
01:24:18 think it's like it's like it's bad i hate it it makes me remember college academy we had that dm
01:24:24 i think his name was kevin something i mean i'm not going to say his name if i remember it
01:24:27 powers kevin powers okay well there you go it's a common it's not that weird a name so i don't
01:24:33 feel like we're dodging anyone all right sure this guy had an incredibly deep voice and he was the dm
01:24:38 in like the dnd clever the it was it was it was like a summer program that we did yeah yeah and
01:24:44 yes and you know ben was older than me so he did it first yes there was a whole bunch of cool stuff
01:24:48 about that but about this guy specifically i remember there was a class you could take that
01:24:51 it was the class you could sign up for was called fantasy because it was structured like college
01:24:56 right you would choose your classes as though where you were picking from a college curriculum
01:24:59 but they were just you know it was some of them were more like educational and some of them were
01:25:04 more just like kind of like sort of camp activities and it was held on a college campus and you would
01:25:09 go from room to room in like in a call yeah and this it was a stone hill college in massachusetts
01:25:15 and um oh yeah yeah there were there were ones on like rocketry where you would build a little
01:25:19 model rockets or i did that one i did that one a lot uh it was really popular and and one of them
01:25:24 was called fantasy adventures and it was a but it was just you play the indy lol that was the best
01:25:30 one yeah it was the best one everybody and kevin powers was this this like fucking scrawny ass
01:25:36 stork of a man i say man he must have been pretty fucking he must have been like probably like 18
01:25:42 at the time but you know we were in like middle school so it seemed like he was he was probably
01:25:47 like a college student or something or maybe i maybe a woman is like 20s his voice was so low
01:25:52 it made him seem older i think that he was not i think he was maybe like very early 20s at the
01:25:58 oldest i could see that yeah yeah but he seemed like i just considered him an adult at the time so
01:26:05 yeah yeah um yeah and he was so scrawny but he had this deep booming voice he he sounded like a
01:26:14 a little bit like george tekay but like yeah he had a vibe i don't know he's like
01:26:21 yeah it's the i i do not one time we asked him about like like the subject of like j rpgs came
01:26:28 up i don't we wouldn't have been in the same class so this is just me but yeah i am the subject of
01:26:32 like j rpgs this stuff came up and he said like mm i do not loathe despise or detest games such as
01:26:41 final fantasy that was the best compliment he could get i do not loathe despise or detest
01:26:49 one time he just showed um the record of lodos war the anime we watch that we watch and in hindsight
01:26:57 based i don't understand what the relevance is other than that it is a movie that has like dnd
01:27:03 like tropes in it like elves and bards i guess the idea was that it was like a good example of like
01:27:09 what like adventuring should feel like with like all different like like a character sort of
01:27:14 playing a different role in the party yeah it does feel like a very dnd like adventures sort of
01:27:20 story he also he please he showed us that was where i saw he showed me um um print the princess
01:27:28 bride and the justification for that the justification for that was like this is what combat should
01:27:34 feel like or can feel like it was like yeah making like like incorporating witty banter
01:27:40 into your like it doesn't just have to be the idea was like combat doesn't just have to be a
01:27:48 dull like dice rolling affair you you can like yeah you throw in some witty banter and then
01:27:53 he played the fucking sword fight scene he was like this is this is how it ah this is how it
01:27:57 should be they don't make them like they used to honestly i think he kind of just wanted to show
01:28:01 us some of his favorite nerd shit uh which is totally which is totally fine yeah and no problem
01:28:07 when i was uh i was briefly a japan like tutor or whatever in college uh where like the people
01:28:14 who were like years behind you would like you just help them practice or whatever on sometimes um
01:28:19 there was uh one time the the the tutors who are tutored me would just play us anime and so i followed
01:28:27 suit by when i was older i think i think i showed everybody um i know he showed us sayonara zetsubo
01:28:33 sensei which actually is a pretty wait that's pretty high-level complex puns wait kevin kevin powers did
01:28:39 no no no this is when i when i was in college when i was like learning japanese uh from like
01:28:44 older kids or older young men or whatever uh anyway i think mate what did i show him i don't
01:28:50 know yeah actually i don't think we didn't show him anything i think i just watched sayonara zetsubo
01:28:54 sensei and i grilled them in grammar because i was a hard ass as i recall kevin but they learned
01:29:01 kevin powers had a rule okay i maybe i got my like hard maybe i got my my philosophy of dnd from him
01:29:09 i think i must have yeah he like i'm kind of a stickler for the whole for the don't ask the the dm
01:29:16 to make a role thing clearly i think that is important but nobody else agrees and i just
01:29:20 guess i just got a fucking deal with that um uh kevin had a rule in his thing which i think is
01:29:30 good like if you if you if you follow the spirit of it i think it is a good rule that improves the
01:29:35 game but like with kids i think it just was like too much of an ask and it ended up derailing the
01:29:42 game yeah a lot but i don't know it i'm not sure if i think its effects were good or bad in this
01:29:49 particular scenario but his rule was not only like never ask can i make a role his rule was never
01:29:58 ask can i do something right you never ask the dm can i do this thing um the appropriate like the
01:30:08 only thing you should be saying is like you you might like you it like it's up to you to gauge
01:30:14 your character's capabilities right yeah like if there's a if there's a 10 foot gap and you
01:30:19 want to know can i jump over it like you should know like can my character clear a 10 foot gap or
01:30:26 like what sort of a skill role is required for a 10 foot gap how likely am i to do it like that's
01:30:30 up to you to decide it's not up to the it's not up to the dm to tell you yes if you tried to jump
01:30:36 you would make it so his rule was yep if you say can i jump the gap he in turn he automatically
01:30:44 interprets it as you attempting to do it so if you yes i remember that oh yeah can i do this you
01:30:50 your character you have done it to find out you have done it make a role yeah oh i remember that
01:30:57 and it was pretty it was great it was pretty it had some pretty funny consequences that was good
01:31:03 shit he knew what he was doing i feel like that's i feel like that's a little harsh uh and maybe if
01:31:09 your dm is nice they should say like i don't know what do you think or i don't know can you or do you
01:31:16 want to roll to find out or something yeah i suppose i think if you're a little more but i think he
01:31:21 wanted to really make a line in the sand like that's not how you play you're not asking the dm to
01:31:27 tell you what's gonna happen you're this college academy man you're here to learn yeah you're here
01:31:32 you gotta you gotta either like what do you think or if you don't know are you willing to risk finding
01:31:37 out right mm-hmm but i was gonna say one example that came to mind uh when you when you began this
01:31:44 about his well all the stuff was that um he would ask us uh no no what was it oh god i'm blanking
01:31:51 there was a very specific thing oh yeah right right that the thing that you started at the beginning
01:31:54 of like um uh like i i searched the room i want to roll to search the room or whatever yeah uh
01:32:01 whenever we when i someone said that he would always say he would have the same answer or the
01:32:04 same question he would respond with he would just say it's like i searched the room he would say
01:32:09 where do you look and i'd be like i the the corner there is nothing in the corner yeah the the floor
01:32:18 okay yeah i yeah he was definitely he was operating in like an older mindset under a system that was
01:32:25 that had less like mechanical complexity and require and like lean more heavily on on role
01:32:30 playing and i think for sure i think yeah like now like dnd like the like fifth edition and
01:32:37 like later editions explicitly you can just kind of have like an investigation skill and you can
01:32:43 just sort of be like make him kill himself if you heard that shit i bet yeah i'm sure he wouldn't
01:32:48 like and he can and you can just kind of make a role like i i investigate the room and and even
01:32:53 that you wouldn't necessarily even have to be that specific maybe unless yeah depending on the dm
01:32:59 and like i get it on the one hand i get it because like if your character is like a detective right
01:33:06 like they are they are a like a great detective or whatever they are like an investigator they're
01:33:11 maybe like a rogue that specializes in like perception and like fact finding and like information
01:33:16 they have really had like they would know how to search a room thoroughly in order to like you
01:33:22 know leave no stone unturned in the pursuit of clues or whatever like they would know how to
01:33:27 do it so to a certain extent i can understand why it shouldn't like the character would know
01:33:33 where to look the character would do a thorough search if they're good at this so i i kind of
01:33:38 get it on the one hand but on the other hand it's like well doesn't it take something away if like
01:33:45 you're not you if like it's kind of taking the power out of the players hands like the players
01:33:48 not making the decision of like of course what's what they're doing it's just sort of it's like
01:33:54 sonic running through a loop you know you're not playing the game the game is playing itself
01:34:00 you know what i mean and you know that's a that i i understand and it's about tradeoffs because
01:34:04 that's a that's a good example because i actually really love i do not really like the original
01:34:08 sonic games but i love the advanced games where it is simply flow state and there's like no decision
01:34:14 making required you just watch a thing go whoosh and it feels pretty sick well i would never okay
01:34:20 but unlike that you're not you don't get a cool visual of sonic the hedgehog running at san xp
01:34:25 huge when you're when you're uh when you're uh you're uh you're basically just batman dnd character
01:34:31 is like you know ransacking the the the villain's lair for a fucking like whatever you know yeah
01:34:38 you're right you're right yeah yeah yeah yeah no he was good times there's a there's a there's the
01:34:44 older dnd mindset was more like it was like it was kind of like you were the character more so
01:34:51 than like your character your character's like identity defines what they do i don't know one
01:34:57 might say old good new bad who would be so bold there's i think that a lot of the role playing
01:35:06 like i think that the like the new the newer mechanics that include things like an invest
01:35:11 like a deliberate investigation skill do encourage this kind of like oh i'm uh i'm gonna roll for
01:35:20 perception to find a thing uh here is like bad role playing that and that encourages that kind
01:35:28 of thing even though i understand the justification and i kind of get it but i think i don't have too
01:35:35 much of an issue or i think i think i think i kind of think i would be okay with it if people didn't
01:35:41 then fall into maybe not everyone agrees with me that it is a bad habit personally i think it's a bad
01:35:48 habit i wouldn't necessarily mind the mechanical the mechanical like option being there if it didn't
01:35:54 lead to these things that i consider to be bad habits and like detrimental to the role playing
01:35:58 experience um but they do in my opinion they do you think that uh like again i don't really care
01:36:06 what people do they can play however they want but like it makes me wonder that like if that's the
01:36:09 kind of game you want to play it feels like it like a jrpg would be more your your kind of thing uh
01:36:15 but i mean you know doing things in a group i get it obviously it's gonna be fun however you want
01:36:19 to do it's fine but it's like it's like if you're just if you're if you're saying okay i don't want
01:36:24 to harp on this too much but that's like one less if you're saying like i i invest like i
01:36:31 investigate uh do i find uh i'm like i'm gonna i'm gonna make a perception check to like see if
01:36:38 there are any enemies out like approaching or whatever it's like are are you that's like it's
01:36:45 like a that's like numbers that's like i don't know that's a mindset wherein the game is made up of
01:36:51 numbers you know yes it is for sure is the wrong i don't it's not the mindset that i want to be in
01:36:56 when i play the the game yeah yeah that's the x factor yeah yes all right well i think that i
01:37:04 think i've said enough about that i made a whole fucking i made a whole fucking video remember
01:37:09 that d&d that time that that tom made a video about d&d yes i do d&d good and i made the one
01:37:15 saying d&d bad i think that wasn't my whole justification that wasn't my whole reasoning
01:37:19 but i think i went into it more in that video and that video is probably like shorter than
01:37:23 the like the the rant i just gave about it uh it's not that long was it like 10 minutes i don't
01:37:28 remember go check it out check it out if you feel like it i guess okay but do not listen to tom's
01:37:38 counter argument no don't give him a chance for air no he is a he is a freaking RLL role player
01:37:46 he is a he is a munch he is he is one of those like what's the word uh he's a munch he's a number
01:37:52 munchkin he is a he is a min maxer he is everything that's wrong with the with the genre
01:38:01 damn fuck you tom die from a harsh man all right i got voicemails if you guys want to go to him
01:38:07 they're all lined up ready to go yeah uh speak pipe link you know what it is ladies and gentlemen
01:38:12 link there it is okay well i got it right here okay so first voicemail there's like uh what do we
01:38:16 got eight total uh oh god the first one here christ don't worry they're not that long okay okay this
01:38:22 first one right this first one is from jelly beaner uh called shaggy is an ass man and there's a there
01:38:29 i received another message or two about this which is just that in the uh the pro anon cast
01:38:34 they're having a civil war that's tearing them apart about uh ass versus tits so okay let's just
01:38:41 hear what they have to say let's hear what shaggy says okay yeah uh we we know we can we can go
01:38:46 let's let's i have okay let's let's play and hear what shaggy says okay go like i've got a serious
01:38:52 conundrum for you guys ass or tits i'll give you a hint it's ass man it's tits it's always
01:39:02 no fuck you die die that's it that's the full message answers tits next they they they came to me
01:39:12 for a for a statement because i made that twist that said tits are epic recently right right right
01:39:18 um and and what i responded to the exclusion of everything else presumably no that's that's my
01:39:24 stance i let me explain um in the situation like tits i would prefer but tits with no ass combined
01:39:35 is strange if you have it's a bad look if any ever like a flat bored but i was like there's
01:39:41 something wrong there but if you have a butt and you don't have tits that's some that that works
01:39:47 so like in two out of two out of two situations the ass is like the solid foundation upon which
01:39:54 the tits can rest yeah but overall sure i would like i i am more of the tits man
01:40:01 but then it needs the ass as support i feel like you've just made an ass argument maybe uh i mean
01:40:09 there's a meme to show we're talking about this the other day uh due to uh this contentious thing
01:40:13 tearing the world apart i uh a point was made that um like asses there is less ability for an
01:40:20 ass to be as horrendous as tits can be in their worst situation so it's something of a situation
01:40:26 where ass is something more of a safe bet and tits can potentially be more spectacular at their
01:40:33 heights i mean i'm sure somebody would agree yeah yeah tits can be more spectacular like there's
01:40:37 only i yeah i i would be i would be more impressed by like incredible tits than i would be by an
01:40:46 incredible uh yeah higher heights higher heights it's because it's the um the uh what's the word
01:40:53 that there's is not a lot of it the scarcity the scarcity of good tits compared to the ease of
01:40:59 having a good ass you know yeah i'm saying yeah i think so yeah i think so uh incidentally uh i i hope
01:41:06 that the pro anon cast is aware of this because there is a in-depth discussion on this subject
01:41:11 now it is it does have a conclusion but you should go check out the prison uh prison school
01:41:16 manga where they go in depth into the deep biological like pre-human evolution roots did i i generally
01:41:22 disagree with that with that argument we don't okay just because we evolved from that doesn't mean
01:41:27 we have to stick with that forever okay i don't know if i've heard this the particular thing
01:41:31 you're talking about but i've heard i'm skeptical of like pre-evolutionary justifications because we
01:41:37 don't know we can only speculate and nobody like really knows like what the evolutionary purpose
01:41:43 of like tits or ass or like why exactly would be they we are shaped this way is like in like a
01:41:49 social context we can't say you know man's opinion yeah you know that there was this video by lindy
01:41:55 beige of all people talking about um the the strange uh fact that women human women do not
01:42:06 have breasts only when they are like fertile in a like a mating season sort of way because other
01:42:11 mammals their breasts are then you know you can't basically basically can't see them but when
01:42:16 they're having babies they you know expand and then afterwards they go back but humans have
01:42:22 sort of evolved to a point where because it's more visual because we're upright he goes into all the
01:42:28 possibilities of like why it is that humans have like breasts for all the time rather than just for
01:42:35 being pregnant this is an interesting video i'll try yeah okay maybe maybe the moid race was uh just
01:42:42 getting pregnant consistently so like it wouldn't biologically there was no need to kind of change
01:42:46 it's it's interesting to speculate on why we are different from other mammals but it but again
01:42:53 we can't like we can't know we can't really know why there is there kind of is no why
01:43:00 yeah yeah or maybe there is rage is on yeah um well we'll leave it to the scholars over the
01:43:07 pro and on cash to hash out i was gonna say did you see yeah did you see that the this image
01:43:13 you probably did the tectonic improv made a ranking of course ranking the first 100 episodes
01:43:20 you know what ben let there's a voicemail about that you know i'll just play it out of water right
01:43:24 okay here let's let's play it and uh here what do you have to say right there go
01:43:30 hello everyone just wanted to call in and mention that i recently made an infographic
01:43:34 ranking the first 100 episodes of the pcp from best to worst and if you haven't seen it check it out
01:43:41 something i want to bring up about it though is the starfleet section i gave each episode that had
01:43:46 a starfleet mentioned a little icon but didn't tally the total amount of times it came up in
01:43:51 the infographic so consider this a podcast exclusive scoop starfleet is mentioned by name
01:43:58 38 times over the course of the first 100 episodes simultaneously a lot and also not as much as i
01:44:06 thought all right that's all i wanted to say thanks for your time there you go that that means
01:44:11 since starfleet is referenced in 20 he has on this infographic starfleet is referenced in 20
01:44:18 out of the first 100 episodes which means that starfleet is referenced an average of just under
01:44:25 two times per episode that it is mentioned in so most episodes i guess that yeah well no because
01:44:34 there might be like certain episodes okay though the record for most starfleet references was
01:44:39 achieved in weird utilitarianism episode totaling at 12 so 12 out of those 38 are just from a single
01:44:45 episode which makes sense considering the topic of that one yes this is a best guy ever is the only
01:44:55 member of the procrastinators to appear in each of the top 15 episodes he puts some particular
01:45:01 emphasis on these top 15 and lethal aurora mage and mother's basement do not appear in any top 15
01:45:07 episodes damn much dream talking mage too much dream talk that's right you lose you you you
01:45:17 just collapse in the rankings if you talk about dreams it's been proven and there's been some
01:45:24 debate i mean you know obviously everyone has their opinions the the much contentious uh the
01:45:28 the much lauded yellow episode things we can't get into not making number one has the people
01:45:33 rioting in the streets yeah that someone would defy that seems to be most peoples that seems to be
01:45:39 the most common pick for number one yeah yeah i'd say so it gives the internet just die again
01:45:46 we lost give again we'll see if he rejoins what a jerk what a freaking rube everybody loves the
01:45:52 virginity episode though so that certainly belongs up there somewhere it seems schools i think i think
01:45:57 tectonic has some weird big connection well not i'm not trying to call him weird but like school
01:46:02 sucks being this high is unusual i bet he has a some you know maybe he has an opinion on it hard
01:46:07 agree a hard agree with some of the things stated on that or maybe yes or maybe not maybe or maybe
01:46:13 not i don't know maybe it's good is that is that a good banter episode i don't fucking remember i
01:46:17 don't know you know i he would know he would know um uh well there is check it out yourself people
01:46:22 it's it's there should we should we go on to the next oh he's back he's back yes gib hello welcome
01:46:29 let us i missed the entirety of that voice call and whatever you said afterwards really well it was
01:46:35 have you seen this that's enough this image from tectonic i i saw the image the rank i can't remember
01:46:40 so many of the episodes and the contents of yeah i am so i can't i don't really have much to say
01:46:45 about it i guess was this made in the context of the rewatch i do not know i do not know i mean he
01:46:52 said he just went in no you know i don't think so because i don't i think the rewatch started
01:46:57 way before the pcb was even founded and i don't think they're even to the beginning yet so uh
01:47:02 like maybe that before oh as in they're starting from like pre-pcp yeah yeah that's right that
01:47:09 i i think i think i saw him post this somewhere and said i am just in like you just saying i don't
01:47:14 know why i did this yeah uh here you go and there it is well when they get to this part to the first
01:47:22 100 episodes in the rewatch i guess i'll be interesting to see if people agree with these
01:47:28 rankings or not yeah consider it consider make your rankings folks all right let's move on to our
01:47:35 next one yes i was curious what you two thought if you could briefly oh i mean we were just saying
01:47:41 that like everybody loves things you can't get into yellow episode uh virginity cast is great
01:47:47 i you know the rest in terms of how they're ranked i don't really have an opinion
01:47:50 yeah yeah no strong opinions uh okay let's go to our next one this is from gay boy scout
01:47:58 babysitter oh yes uh okay listen up here we go go on a recent twitch.tv slash definitely best guy
01:48:05 ever stream nat told a childhood story about his gay boy scout babysitter who ruined the family's
01:48:10 legend of dragoon for ps1 game nat said he was fuzzy on the details though and would need to ask ben
01:48:16 about it so can we please hear the full story about legend of dragoon for ps1 do you remember this ben
01:48:23 do you remember this incident about the game breaking right there was there was a discus being
01:48:30 thrown uh yes a kid in a kid in our boy scout troupe he was my age this kid jeff right i don't know
01:48:37 why i think i brought the game to a fucking boy scout meeting just to show it off or something
01:48:43 and this other kid just like took one of the discs and like threw it yeah and it broke the third
01:48:49 disc and i was like what the fuck you just broke fucking my video game and he was like
01:48:54 uh it was the third and three dis before dis and i was he was like oh you'll never get that far in
01:48:59 any way what oh god no are you fucking kidding me this man was not a rpg gamer i don't remember if
01:49:08 like and i think we we did in fact get that far and we oh yeah i did insist like no you broke my
01:49:16 thing give me like fucking pay for it you broke my shit and i think like the they did they like his
01:49:22 mom was made did make him like like you know pay me some money for like a replacement or whatever
01:49:27 which is good but we did never we didn't get it till a way later yeah yeah like we had already
01:49:33 gotten that far in the game and we're held up by it and so and so and when he finally got around
01:49:38 to like giving us the the money giving me the money for it and like i ordered like a replacement
01:49:43 yeah we had been like stuck for a while i never i eventually never i eventually never finished the
01:49:50 game uh you you did yeah i think i only got to the end of the second disc and then never
01:49:55 gotten me further in it so he was right no no i got there i just didn't play i just didn't go
01:50:03 any more it's not the same it's a principle i have a i have a memory though it was right but
01:50:10 it was a self-fulfilling prophecy he made that come true piece of shit jeff you i clearly remember
01:50:17 you buying me a copy of the legend of dragoon was it like at this time like for my birthday you
01:50:23 got it or something like years later because that's what i have in my head of that i bought you
01:50:29 i think that maybe maybe okay i think i thought that i i had the game or or did you was it your
01:50:40 game when when he broke it i thought it was mine yours i think it was yours at that time did it maybe
01:50:46 like he bought me the replacement maybe i just like used that money that he gave me to buy the disc
01:50:55 and gave it to you because like you had gotten further in the game than i had because like you
01:51:00 know i just don't know this is going back a long time i've lost some of these details yeah or maybe
01:51:05 or maybe that's the best i got or maybe like it was my game he broke it i like got that far and
01:51:13 then quit playing it he eventually paid it back for me you had played the game yes and had and wanted
01:51:20 it again and i hadn't decided like i didn't even really care to replace it that much or had just
01:51:24 forgotten about it but then eventually i got you a copy of the game as a gift because you did want
01:51:30 to continue it i feel like that's the gist maybe or something like that i think by by the way i think
01:51:37 the reason i was confused and mix things up because like i said like the boy scout troop
01:51:40 leader whatever i was thinking of the another guy remember it was the i said babysitter mat one of
01:51:45 the guys from our troop like an older guy came over and he babysat us and i believe we were playing
01:51:50 frisbee with another ps1 discus related you know crisis we were playing frisbee with final fantasy
01:51:56 eight disc why didn't break the disc but i think something else broke because i remember us all
01:52:01 being like oh shit what did we do fuck we broke something i don't know if i was i involved in
01:52:06 that i remember that something like that did happen but the details are very fuzzy yeah long
01:52:13 time ago i don't know why we would do such a thing what a bizarre world boy scout troop
01:52:20 members are the worst people yeah they're reckless they're full hearty fuck them and they're too
01:52:27 cavalier and i don't care for it things cannot be replaced aren't the boy scouts like fucking
01:52:32 disbanding or something because of all the like creepy sex shit uh i heard some talks of bankruptcy
01:52:38 i'm not sure yeah that's it they went bankrupt i think they went bankrupt boy scout association
01:52:44 or something like uh well i think it would be boy scouts of america right boy scouts of america
01:52:50 is its own like entity i'm yeah it's separate it's like a separate uh a thing based on the i don't
01:52:57 change their name to the scouts to not exclude women anymore or something well um try them all
01:53:03 four exclude women it's fine just do it who cares um um um uh boy that's a fucking quagmire it is a
01:53:13 quagmire no doubt about it um all right whatever we got another voicemail over this fucking place
01:53:20 this one is uh from pancakes i am become death destroyer of sound boards uh yes okay take it away
01:53:28 go bruh hi pancakes here listen no one hates sound boards more than me why is that especially if
01:53:36 they're wielded by weak willed and weak minded people uh Nate however i'm 100 for everyone
01:53:45 having a sound board on the pcp because sound boards are like nuclear arms you see if everyone has
01:53:52 one no one's gonna get a sound board they're flying after easy money they don't have the moral
01:54:03 courage they don't have what i have uh did you did you build your own sound board yeah brick by brick
01:54:10 piece by piece over like months and i mean did you choose what sounds are on it oh yeah of course
01:54:16 of course okay to prepare each one and you know stick it in there and um i i'm with this guy
01:54:22 honestly down bitches i yeah i'm tempted to take it i'm tempted to follow this advice that's pretty
01:54:29 good right um easy money you're very powerful you're very spiteful uh understood uh yes we've
01:54:50 got a new voicemail called attack my titans okay go so i recently found out that about a year ago
01:54:59 there was an attack on titan art exhibition and within this exhibition there was a single room
01:55:05 that was completely black and in the room there was the i guess the artist the mangaka created an
01:55:13 audio experience of what the finale of attack on titan will sound like and you can actually find
01:55:19 this on youtube it's really cool super haunting really fascinating uh i have no interest in attack
01:55:25 on titan until now where i just want to read it all because i'm fascinated at how this experience
01:55:31 can be connected to the manga basically i guess a discussion or question is has there ever been
01:55:36 anything that has just really interested you like one single thing that you heard about from a piece
01:55:42 of media that you instantly wanted to read or watch or experience thanks so much here's about that
01:55:48 question uh boring but the actual the first thing about what this is this like audio experience of
01:55:55 what the ending of the series will be like by the mangaka that's that's pretty kooky i i googled
01:56:01 it i could not find it on youtube by by the attack on titan guy he made an audio experience of the
01:56:07 end of attack on titan do i have that right apparently yeah that's just nice soundboard
01:56:12 easy money yeah that's what it sounds like
01:56:18 that's uh shut up that's uh uh very strange is there dialogue i don't know i don't know i don't
01:56:29 i could not find the damn thing i wonder like i want to know like how long it is and stuff i mean
01:56:34 you're supposed to go there and like sit and listen it's probably like well i don't know i can only
01:56:38 speculate i assume minutes as opposed to hours would be my guess but i don't know i don't know
01:56:44 uh if anyone could find this link it because i couldn't find it and it sounds
01:56:48 at least worth checking out um it's partly on youtube so there you go is there any one thing
01:56:54 that's made me interested in a piece of media um art uh is good i don't know uh see it's boring
01:57:04 seeing people with troll avatars on uh something awful made me wonder what Homestuck was lamal
01:57:11 i guess reading sweet bro and hella jeff which i did independently made me then read Homestuck
01:57:16 you know because i love sweet bro and hella so the real question is what made you read Homestuck
01:57:21 yeah that's the actual question yeah gibb care to comment
01:57:26 he just not care to comment all right we'll move right along uh maybe he's just gonna think
01:57:31 again i don't know uh all right next voicemail this one is we got two more this is from mozilla
01:57:36 fennekin simply titled oppression go hello it's been a while here in voice jail i've gained the
01:57:43 system enough to acquire a computer with internet access except i can only browse speak pipe and
01:57:48 reddit but i happen to stumble across the capital of reddit r slash small dick problems here i
01:57:56 witnessed the most oppressed minorities in society boys with a small pp with every piece of media
01:58:03 we are deluged by the glorification of big dicks someone does something cool like save a kitten
01:58:08 loot a target high gamer score that's big dick energy right there but bad things racism boolicking
01:58:14 corporate greed watching anime that's small dick energy the board of small dick problems is an
01:58:21 archive of real men who are discriminated against by all of society these men have lost the potential
01:58:27 loves of their lives just for an unfortunate sequence of genes women have it so easy men are such
01:58:35 primitive thirsty creatures that women of all sizes are valued sure there might be a bias towards
01:58:40 larger breasts but they're countless men who prefer the small flat lolly chest but nobody and i mean
01:58:48 no woman ever i hate this call yeah seven inch dick is cool but i'm all about that three and a half
01:58:53 you know yeah we must take a stand for our stout gentlemen and unite against the common enemy
01:58:59 yeah women enough of these fake woke care okay that's our hashtag all largely bored all right
