00:00:24 The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:28 Oh dear god, all fucking Christ.
00:00:32 Welcome. If you hear some pitter pattering, that's because it's raining outside at the moment.
00:00:38 Hopefully that just makes it even more soothing if you can even hear it.
00:00:45 So...
00:00:47 I'd been saying on the last couple shows that I felt great.
00:00:51 I kept reiterating that I feel great as I've been pumping iron and eating whatever I want
00:00:58 or whatever.
00:00:59 But man, I also said on the last show that I was gonna quit smoking because it was starting
00:01:05 to get out of hand.
00:01:07 And boy, quitting smoking when you actually have started to get addicted to it, not easy.
00:01:15 Not an easy proposition, I gotta say.
00:01:17 You know, historically, this is the way I handle things when I'm scared I'm getting
00:01:23 addicted because I definitely have always had an addictive personality.
00:01:28 I take something and I make it a part of my life and it just is what I do from then on.
00:01:35 From when I was about 12 until I was 22 or 23 I think, I drank nothing but Mountain Dew.
00:01:43 I just drank Mountain Dew all day, every day.
00:01:46 It's all I drank.
00:01:47 Yeah, before that I drank mostly Sprite and other sodas.
00:01:50 I grew up on soda, you know, I grew up exclusively on soda pretty much.
00:01:56 Huge oversight on my parents' part, but they also drank soda, or did drink soda back then.
00:02:03 None of us were very health conscious until much later.
00:02:06 But yeah, I grew up drinking Mountain Dew for the better part of 10 years and, you know,
00:02:11 all the teeth fucking I have have cavities and fillings and shit, let me know cavities
00:02:19 now they're all filled, but I have asked tons of fillings, you know, I drank it obsessively
00:02:24 for so long and anytime I'd go without it it was like a real problem, you know, it was
00:02:29 definitely a hard line addiction.
00:02:32 I would get real upset and real depressed if I didn't have Mountain Dew for, you know,
00:02:39 like a day.
00:02:40 There was one time that my parents, you know, as we got, as the years went on they started
00:02:46 to realize how bad Mountain Dew was for you.
00:02:49 So at one point when I was like 17 I think, I think it was in my senior year of high school,
00:02:55 my parents decided to stop buying us Mountain Dew.
00:02:58 They were like, you know, we're not going to, we're not going to support you guys drinking
00:03:04 it anymore.
00:03:05 To me, Victor and Shay, because we all drank it.
00:03:07 Those are my two little brothers, if anyone doesn't know.
00:03:09 And yeah, so they stopped giving us Mountain Dew.
00:03:13 And so because at the time I was riding my bike to and from school every day, I would
00:03:22 just like not spend my lunch money, you know, I'd just like save up my lunch money for a
00:03:27 couple days.
00:03:28 I'd save up the, my mom would give me like $3 because it's like $2 for a regular lunch
00:03:32 and then an extra dollar to get like, you know, to get more essentially because the
00:03:39 lunches were pretty small.
00:03:41 So she would give me the extra dollar and then I would save up those extra dollars and
00:03:45 then every other day I would go to 7-Eleven on the way home and buy a like, you know,
00:03:53 a big ass Mountain Dew ball, like the biggest one I could get.
00:03:57 And this went on for a few months of like us not getting Mountain Dew and I, I was fucking
00:04:04 miserable for those three months.
00:04:06 Like I was, I was generally depressed anyways back in high school, but I was like real bad.
00:04:11 I stopped writing my anime blog entirely for those three months.
00:04:16 Like I think I made one post, it was, it was like, I distinctly remember that I just went
00:04:24 on this long unintended hiatus from everything that was going on.
00:04:28 I wasn't really watching anime either.
00:04:30 I think I, I think I just stopped everything essentially.
00:04:33 It was just, just feeling like shit for that whole time.
00:04:37 And then what finally broke it was that my parents went out of town, like they were going
00:04:43 out to go to like some other country or something.
00:04:48 And they left a bunch of money for us to buy groceries.
00:04:51 Now me, Victor and Shade are not the type to like, buy groceries.
00:04:56 Like we'll subsist off of like bread rather than actually make food, you know, for ourselves
00:05:02 and stuff.
00:05:03 Like we probably, I don't even know if we bothered.
00:05:06 I mean, I don't know how we would even get.
00:05:08 I think my parents had like, no, it wasn't that they left us money for groceries.
00:05:12 It was like that they had, we had bought groceries before they left and then it was like, this
00:05:15 is if you run out of food or if there was an emergency or something, you know, we'll
00:05:18 leave you with some money.
00:05:20 So we, as soon as my parents left, we went down to 7-Eleven and bought like 12 bottles
00:05:30 of Mountain Dew, two liters, you know, and it brought them all back home.
00:05:37 And then we, we marathoned Lucky Star.
00:05:41 Like that night, me and my, my friend Donsan, we sat on the couch and this was the time,
00:05:46 I think I've mentioned this before in a video somewhere that like we, we had Anime Suki
00:05:50 open and there was this thread on Anime Suki, which is an anime forum, um, which had like
00:05:56 goes through every single reference in Lucky Star and explains all of them.
00:06:00 And we were like watching the show while like pausing to look at the references and stuff
00:06:04 and, and you know, figure out what all the jokes mean and stuff.
00:06:07 It was a great time.
00:06:08 We marathoned the whole show in a day, 20, 24 episodes, I think, in one day, drinking
00:06:17 all this Mountain Dew and you know, by the time my parents got back, I guess they had
00:06:21 just like forgotten or they figured out that we had, you know, done this and they're just
00:06:25 like, fuck it.
00:06:26 So they started buying this Mountain Dew again.
00:06:28 Wasn't until I was 22 or 23 that I finally had the willpower to just do it myself to
00:06:34 actually quit.
00:06:36 So I quit completely and what I took up instead is Wawa Diet Green Tea.
00:06:42 Wawa is a local, um, convenience store slash like fast foodie restaurant kind of thing.
00:06:50 Um, and it's mostly a convenience store.
00:06:54 They sell food that like they, they'll make for you kind of thing.
00:06:58 There's nowhere to actually sit down and eat.
00:07:00 But anyways, they have their own tea and I don't know what it is about their tea in
00:07:06 particular because like, uh, growing up, I never liked tea, but then I discovered like
00:07:12 cold green tea and I was like, this is actually kind of drinkable and I tried a bunch of different
00:07:16 brands, but the Diet Wawa Green Tea is the one that like really is the only one I really
00:07:23 like.
00:07:24 So I took that up and the reason I chose Diet Green Tea is because it has no nutritional
00:07:29 value.
00:07:30 It's basically just water and fake sugar, you know, it's just like water and aspartum
00:07:35 and that's it.
00:07:36 And aspartum has a lot of people say a lot of bad stuff about aspartum.
00:07:40 Most of it's not actually scientifically founded.
00:07:43 It's mostly rumor aspartum is not actually bad for you.
00:07:47 And as it happens, there's been more scientific studies done on it than like anything else
00:07:51 in the universe because of all the bad rumors, but it's not actually bad for you.
00:07:59 So yeah, I have an addictive personality.
00:08:04 I gave up Mountain Dew and took up Diet Green Tea.
00:08:07 Now Diet Green Tea is a completely harmless addiction, so I don't mind that I'm addicted
00:08:11 to it.
00:08:12 I will get irritable if I don't have that like regular caffeine intake and have, you
00:08:18 know, something like the Diet Green Tea.
00:08:21 And now I can't even really stomach much soda anymore.
00:08:23 I can have like a soda a day kind of thing.
00:08:29 But I was always, you know, it's okay to be addicted to that, but I've always been afraid
00:08:33 of other addictions.
00:08:35 I try to keep everything to a minimum.
00:08:37 Like I love drinking alcohol, but anytime I've started to feel like maybe I'm drinking
00:08:43 too much alcohol, I'll put a stop to it.
00:08:46 I'll stop drinking for a little while.
00:08:48 And I've always found it's easy to do so.
00:08:51 Alcohol to me doesn't feel like an addiction so much as just something I really enjoy doing
00:08:56 and, you know, not doing it for a long period of time is just boring and it feels like
00:09:01 why am I not, why have I decided not to drink alcohol, you know, because it doesn't feel
00:09:06 like I'm dependent on it, just feels like it's something I enjoy doing.
00:09:10 Now cigarettes, on the other hand, it's always been this sort of tightrope balance where
00:09:15 I took up smoking in like 2011.
00:09:21 At first I was barely doing it.
00:09:23 At first I didn't even like it.
00:09:25 But then the period when I started smoking more was my mom was in the hospital with cancer
00:09:29 and the stress from that I was just looking for any way to relieve the stress.
00:09:34 So I started smoking and I would only smoke one cigarette a day, two at the most, because
00:09:38 by the time I finished one usually I was starting to get a head rush.
00:09:42 Like smoking more than you can handle will give you headaches and make you dizzy and
00:09:47 make you feel weird for the rest of the day.
00:09:49 So for a long time I couldn't even handle more than one cigarette a day, you know, and
00:09:53 one cigarette a day felt like this is not enough to, you know, to become a huge problem.
00:09:59 I'm not addicted, you know, the people who have real health risks from smoking or the
00:10:04 people who are smoking like two packs a fucking day, you know, not to say that there's no
00:10:08 health risk in smoking period, but you know, I didn't feel like it was becoming a big problem.
00:10:14 But for years I've been like keeping myself to any time I start to get used to smoking
00:10:21 more than one a day, that's when I stop.
00:10:24 If I get up to like two a day starting to feel normal, I could even handle three a day,
00:10:28 I would stop and I would just quit for like a month all the time.
00:10:31 I would just say like, this is getting too scary, I'm gonna quit smoking and I'd quit
00:10:35 for a while.
00:10:37 Usually what would start me back up is someone who I know who smokes would come around and
00:10:42 we'd have a cigarette together because having a cigarette together is super fun.
00:10:46 Great social, like great way to hang out with people and have a conversation is to stand
00:10:50 around and smoke.
00:10:51 It's super cool and fun and aesthetic and awesome.
00:10:55 But it also means that you have to go buy another pack of cigarettes and a pack of cigarettes
00:11:01 has 20 cigarettes in it and if you have 20, you're gonna smoke them all.
00:11:06 Now sometimes I would take two months to smoke 20 cigarettes, you know.
00:11:11 Sometimes I have one every couple of days, forget about them, leave them around, you
00:11:15 know, take my time.
00:11:17 I'd buy cigarettes so rarely that, you know, one of the problems with being addicted to
00:11:22 smoking is that it can be a huge drain on your wallet, you know.
00:11:25 It's only five and a half bucks for a pack of cigarettes here, which is pretty low compared
00:11:32 to how it is in some states, but nonetheless, you know, it's not expensive if you're not
00:11:38 doing it all the time.
00:11:40 If you're smoking a pack a day, it's obviously quite expensive.
00:11:43 So I had quit smoking for a little while and then Ben moved in and Ben also smokes when
00:11:51 offered.
00:11:52 He hadn't been before he moved in, but we started smoking together.
00:11:54 Well Ben was smoking a lot more than I'm used to.
00:11:57 He would go out three or four times a day and because I was drunk consistently for like
00:12:02 a week when Radcon happened, I was smoking just as much with him.
00:12:06 And so I got back into it and I got harder into it and I started smoking more and buying
00:12:12 more packs and buying more different kinds.
00:12:15 Well, it wasn't too bad, but then, you know, Ben loves vaping and Ben sees it as like if
00:12:21 you're vaping, then it's no big deal because even though like the worst thing about vaping
00:12:30 is that it's addictive, it's that you will, like it's still addicting to be addicted to
00:12:36 nicotine and you, you know, you had to spend money to fuel that addiction.
00:12:42 But it doesn't cause like most of the problems that cigarettes cause.
00:12:49 There have been cases where vaping was causing other problems, but those have been regulated
00:12:55 since then and like currently, I mean, it's possible that it causes problems that we don't
00:13:00 even know about yet because there's not enough research done on it yet, but like the way it
00:13:05 looks right now is that the worst thing about vaping is the fact that it's addictive, which
00:13:09 in itself doesn't seem like a huge problem as long as you're okay with being addicted
00:13:15 to something and spending money on it.
00:13:20 So Ben is all about vaping and he got me interested in the idea, so I bought an e-cigarette, not
00:13:28 a full blown vape, just like one that you can buy over the counter at 7-eleven, you know.
00:13:34 And what I quickly found is that because you can vape indoors and because there's no sense
00:13:42 of finality with a vape, where with a cigarette, you smoke it until it's done and then you
00:13:47 throw it away.
00:13:48 If you're trying to keep to one cigarette a day, that's very easy to do.
00:13:52 With a vape, you don't know how much is too much.
00:13:54 You don't know how much you're really getting.
00:13:57 You don't know when to start and stop every time you do it.
00:14:00 And so you just kind of consistently vape all day, you know, and you don't have to leave
00:14:04 the room to do it because it just dissolves into the atmosphere, it's gone, it's vapor.
00:14:10 So very quickly, I started vaping way more than I was ever smoking.
00:14:15 You know, it's way easier to vape all day.
00:14:18 But what I found with the e-cigarettes is that the stupid fucking, the little cartridges
00:14:27 they give you, like my cigarette came with one, you know, and then you buy them in packs
00:14:32 of two.
00:14:33 The cartridges only last like two days at the most.
00:14:36 Like, if you're smoking it, you know, consistently, it only lasts you about two, two and a half
00:14:41 days.
00:14:43 And a pack of two is seven dollars.
00:14:47 So this is way more expensive than smoking normal cigarettes would be.
00:14:52 Like normal cigarettes, you buy a pack for five and a half dollars and it's 20 cigarettes.
00:14:57 Even if I was smoking for a day, that lasts me five days and that's, you know, as long
00:15:03 if not longer than the seven dollars for the two fucking cartridges was gonna, you know,
00:15:09 was gonna run me.
00:15:10 So yeah, I was like, this is way more expensive.
00:15:14 So immediately, I switched back to cigarettes.
00:15:17 But now, thanks to vaping, you know, making it easy to consume nicotine all day long,
00:15:24 I found that suddenly I could smoke way more cigarettes.
00:15:28 Suddenly I can smoke five or six in a day, you know, which I couldn't, I could not do
00:15:34 before.
00:15:35 Not that I didn't do it.
00:15:36 I could not even do that before.
00:15:38 And I had, I had bought these cigarettes, I bought a couple of different specialty like
00:15:43 cool brands that I had heard about, you know, that I just wanted to try and got way too
00:15:47 into it.
00:15:48 So I was like, okay, this is out of hand.
00:15:51 That's where I was when I recorded the last podcast was like the day that I decided, okay,
00:15:55 let's quit again.
00:15:56 Now here's the important question.
00:15:59 Do I take up vape or do I just quit entirely?
00:16:04 Now the obvious answer is quit entirely, right?
00:16:07 Who needs another expensive smoking hobby in your life?
00:16:11 Why even do this stuff, right?
00:16:14 But the truth is that there's a reason that I've been smoking all this time and vaping
00:16:19 and all this stuff.
00:16:20 And it's because it is a stress relief and it is a simple stress relief you can do from
00:16:25 home.
00:16:26 It's something you don't have to go anywhere.
00:16:27 You don't have to do anything other than, you know, it's an excuse to get out of the
00:16:31 chair, to get up and go stand outside for five to 10 minutes and just relax and, you
00:16:39 know, and consume something which slightly changes your mind for a minute and helps you
00:16:45 to have more energy and stuff, you know.
00:16:48 It's kind of like an energy drink, except not completely disgusting.
00:16:52 It makes your stomach hurt, at least for me.
00:16:54 That's what they do to me.
00:16:57 So you know, yeah, it's like vaping, again, the worst part about it is that it's addictive
00:17:05 and that you have to pay for that addiction.
00:17:07 But am I willing to have that addiction or do I think I should just go completely, you
00:17:13 know, completely without it?
00:17:15 So my first instinct is fuck getting your vape.
00:17:18 I'm just gonna, you know, I'm just gonna cold turkey it as I've done so many times before.
00:17:23 It's never been hard before.
00:17:25 It was never that hard to drop cigarettes for a month.
00:17:27 You know, I might feel a little like, I might feel cravings for a couple days, but I didn't
00:17:32 feel like I needed it.
00:17:34 These last three days, I felt like I fucking needed it.
00:17:39 I felt irritable.
00:17:40 I felt shitty.
00:17:42 I didn't want to do anything.
00:17:44 And it doesn't help that this was compounded with another, in the last podcast I was talking
00:17:49 about the sort of big release that you get, the big come from posting a video up on YouTube.
00:17:57 And I kind of got this like one-two punch going on where I finished watching Tsukuyomi
00:18:02 Moonphase, which was the last thing I had to watch for the first part of this video series
00:18:08 I have upcoming.
00:18:10 And like, it was a pain to watch.
00:18:12 Like I did not enjoy most of the show and it really sucked to try to finish it.
00:18:17 But I finished it like right at the same time that DeVu was finishing up the Cool Character
00:18:23 Designs Gorilla Gone video and that released right at the end of the month and I got all
00:18:27 my affairs in order.
00:18:28 I had a lot of stuff kind of piled up that I had to finish and I finished all of it at
00:18:32 once.
00:18:34 And I was standing at a point where there's no half finished project that needs to get
00:18:39 done right now.
00:18:41 You know, suddenly there's nothing on the plate.
00:18:44 We skipped PCP this week so I didn't have a PCP to edit.
00:18:48 We, you know, I finished editing the commentary for the month.
00:18:53 Some other shit.
00:18:54 I mean, there are some half finished vlogs that I mentioned in the last podcast, but
00:18:59 like nothing that was immediately on the plate was left uneaten.
00:19:06 And so for like, you know, at the start of November 1st, I just kind of woke up and was
00:19:11 like, oh, I have no plans.
00:19:13 I have nothing to do.
00:19:14 And I also don't want to do anything.
00:19:16 I don't want to start anything because I have this really intense craving for nicotine
00:19:21 right now and I feel like shit.
00:19:24 And I just kind of didn't do anything for a whole day.
00:19:29 And then I borrowed the book Brand New World from Ben, started reading it that night, passed
00:19:34 out, finished reading it the next day.
00:19:37 That's all I did.
00:19:39 I read Brave New World all day.
00:19:41 Both of these days, I was awake for like probably only 12 hours or so.
00:19:45 Like I woke up before noon and passed out before midnight at some point.
00:19:52 But like, you know, close to those times, I just, I lost all energy.
00:19:58 I was completely lethargic.
00:19:59 I didn't want to do anything.
00:20:03 And then today, you know, the third, it's the fourth now, but the third is where I start
00:20:10 today.
00:20:11 Um, I was just like, fuck it, I'm going to buy a vape, like, because even if this is
00:20:17 a feeling that will eventually go away, even if cold turkey would eventually lead to me
00:20:22 not craving this, I thought there's no way I'm going the rest of my life without smoking
00:20:28 or vaping.
00:20:29 There's just, it's unreasonable to think so, you know, because again, what they provide
00:20:35 is something that I would want even if I wasn't addicted, just to be able to get up from my
00:20:40 chair, stand outside for five to 10 minutes and take some drags of something that's going
00:20:45 to calm me down and help me to deal with the monotony of my existence, which is a life
00:20:51 where I, all I, everything I do is connected to a computer chair, you know, and I look
00:20:56 for every excuse to get up from that chair.
00:20:58 And most of the excuses I have are to go get food and I can't constantly go get food,
00:21:03 you know.
00:21:04 So at some point, there has to be something else I can do and it ended up being the easiest
00:21:10 thing to do at home is to just go outside and have a smoke.
00:21:13 So I was like, I don't think I'm going to not do this ever again.
00:21:17 So I might as well just buy a fucking, like a real vape, you know, because it ultimately
00:21:23 is a lot less costly than using the e-cigarettes because even though the e-cigarettes, the
00:21:29 thing about a real vape, like the one I'm currently holding and have been taking hits
00:21:34 from as, as I record this is that the vape itself is like $45 and the liquid, I got like
00:21:43 a $15 bottle of liquid, which is pretty big.
00:21:48 And it comes with a battery, it's rechargeable, so I shouldn't need a replacement battery,
00:21:52 but that's something you, you know, you can get and it comes at these coils and the coils
00:21:56 last about two weeks before they burn out and then you have to replace them.
00:22:00 I have one extra one.
00:22:01 So about, they cost about $5.
00:22:03 So every two weeks, you're spending $5 on a replacement coil and every once in a while
00:22:08 you're buying more of the, of the shit you burn in it.
00:22:13 So it still costs, you know, a decent amount of money and especially it's front loaded.
00:22:19 You pay a lot upfront for all this shit, you know, and then you kind of maintenance it.
00:22:24 Whereas with the e-cigarette, it's like $10, you know, but then you immediately have to
00:22:29 buy cartridges.
00:22:31 This shit ultimately is way cheaper if you're going to be doing it for a long time compared
00:22:36 to the e-cigarettes.
00:22:38 So you know, that's a big part of it because I really didn't want to go back to the e-cigarettes
00:22:42 because they're way too expensive.
00:22:43 There's just no way I could justify spending what would probably be like $15 a fucking week
00:22:49 to keep that thing going.
00:22:51 And also doesn't hold a charge for shit.
00:22:54 You, you like, you know, drag on it for like five minutes and the battery's dead.
00:22:58 So yeah, you have to constantly have it on the charger if you're not using it, which
00:23:03 is a pain in the ass.
00:23:05 The real thing, infinitely better.
00:23:08 So I went for it and yeah, that's why I'm going to end up being a vapor from now on,
00:23:15 probably.
00:23:16 It's just a matter of like, what fits my lifestyle.
00:23:20 And I'm not saying that I would advise this to anyone else or that like my justifications
00:23:25 are necessarily like a good idea, but just I can't see myself as someone who would not
00:23:33 at all find it infinitely easier for my life for me to be able to get up and go outside
00:23:40 and take a drag of a vape as composed as opposed to being someone who doesn't, you know, have
00:23:46 to drop that little bit of money and that little bit of a, of knowing that I'm addicted
00:23:51 to something on the table.
00:23:58 You know, I have always been an extremely impressionable person.
00:24:03 A big part of how I end up smoking so often is that I see someone else doing it and I
00:24:09 immediately want to do it.
00:24:10 Or I just even see a cigarette or have a suggestion of their existence.
00:24:14 I'll want to do it.
00:24:18 But also when it comes to creative stuff.
00:24:20 I have a tendency when I see someone doing something, especially for something I think
00:24:25 I could do on some level that I immediately want to do it.
00:24:29 Any time I like, you know, consume a piece of media that really affects me in any kind
00:24:34 of way, I'm like, I want to recreate this.
00:24:37 I want to make something like that.
00:24:43 Now I've kind of curbed this in more recent years to mostly apply to things that I am
00:24:51 already in the wheelhouse of like, I no longer will watch a movie, like a great movie and
00:24:57 immediately think I want to go make a movie because I know what goes into making a movie
00:25:02 and it's not fun.
00:25:03 It's not stuff I want to do.
00:25:06 It's not really my field of expertise.
00:25:10 I mean, sometimes I wish, sometimes I have ideas in my head that I think would only work
00:25:16 as a movie, but not that often.
00:25:19 More often than not, the way I think has become reflective of the mediums I work in, which
00:25:25 are writing and YouTube videography, vlogging essentially, you know, vlogging, vlogging.
00:25:36 Like I mean, the stuff I do, like podcasting is not considered a vlog, but it is essentially
00:25:44 the same thing, you know, it's just a vlog without a face.
00:25:49 And while vlogging is thought of as showing your face on camera, what I do in my main
00:25:55 channel is just blogging, like I ran an anime blog and I write the exact same way I did
00:26:02 before, it's just now a video.
00:26:04 So it's basically vlogging, you know, all the stuff I do is vlogging essentially or writing.
00:26:11 And so when I see writers who are inspiring to me of any kind, like if I read a film crit
00:26:19 Hulk article, that's always a great inspiration for me to go make analysis videos because
00:26:24 he's my favorite media analyst.
00:26:26 And so reading his writing really, you know, gets me in that mood of like, oh, I'm going
00:26:30 to write a great analytical blog post, you know, but then seeing certain stuff that's
00:26:37 more narrative driven, that's like, that reminds me that I could be creating a narrative.
00:26:43 Those are the things that sort of get to me in a way that is of questionable goodness.
00:26:50 Because I'm not a good fiction writer, I'm not good at weaving a narrative that's anything
00:26:59 other than obvious or like is exactly what I am.
00:27:03 I'm very blunt and direct about my approach to things.
00:27:07 When I watch like an endless Jess video, one of his that go into like these really winding
00:27:13 or in depth scenarios, you know, especially something like the Horseshoe finale or its
00:27:18 sequel, then I have this sense of like, man, I could be doing so much more with the medium
00:27:26 of YouTube videography.
00:27:27 You know, I could be creating these meta loop holes and like really, you know, twisting
00:27:33 my language in such a way to set up and pay off and all that stuff and creating a more
00:27:38 narrative experience because I do think that people feel something more deeply when they
00:27:44 get that kind of narrative experience.
00:27:46 You know, I think I've made a lot of vlogs that people have told me are like deeply important
00:27:54 to them.
00:27:55 Once in a while, I make a podcast or a vlog and people tell me, man, this one really
00:28:01 resonated with me and it's my favorite one you've ever done and I'm so glad you said
00:28:05 this and it's been really life affirming for me and I really appreciate that.
00:28:10 But at the same time, I feel like with those kind of videos, you will eventually just internalize
00:28:16 the sentiment more so than remember the video.
00:28:20 You know, like if I say something like, here's what you, here's how you should treat your
00:28:24 life and someone says, wow, I never thought of it that way.
00:28:27 I'm going to treat my life that way from now on.
00:28:29 It's the sentiment that you'll keep remembering, not how it was delivered to you.
00:28:34 And with Endless Jess, what you remember is how it was delivered to you.
00:28:40 You know, what made Horseshoe Finale so memorable is not just the things being said, but the
00:28:45 fact that he was in that set with that shot, you know, in that pose, him saying it in the
00:28:51 way he said it.
00:28:54 Not to devalue what I do, but I definitely think that there's, there's a level of artistry
00:29:01 to what Jesse's doing, that I haven't completely tapped into yet.
00:29:05 And I have had moments that did it.
00:29:07 I think the biggest one is in the Asterisk War Sucks Part 9 with the McDonald's thing,
00:29:14 where I, you know, I just broke into this very evocative, artful feeling and I sort
00:29:20 of told this little narrative about me going to McDonald's and it really had a lot of impact.
00:29:27 Not just like, you know, it wasn't just about the sentiment of A1 Pictures makes things,
00:29:33 you know, all look the same.
00:29:34 It was like the way it was delivered was what's memorable about it, that, wow, he, he did this
00:29:39 film segment and, you know, I want to be able to make more things like that.
00:29:46 When I read novels, like classic literature, like I just read, you know, Brave New World,
00:29:52 and I was thinking how, if I wrote a story like Brave New World, my instinct would be
00:29:58 to just literally describe it, to just describe this world.
00:30:02 And a lot of the book is kind of that.
00:30:05 This book is very heavy on just world building and a lot less story.
00:30:10 And when it actually does develop a story, it gets a lot less interesting, in my opinion.
00:30:14 The most interesting part is the beginning where it's just establishing the setting.
00:30:17 But it does it in a very, you know, narrative way, with very flowery language that sort
00:30:23 of leads you through and has all these clever, you know, writing techniques.
00:30:27 It's not blunt the way my writing is, the way my talking is, where I'm just telling
00:30:32 you exactly what things are, you know.
00:30:35 There's nothing to interpret in the way I talk.
00:30:38 And I think that that extra little bit of having to interpret, of having to, you know,
00:30:45 process information, helps it to become more memorable and more ingrained in your psyche.
00:30:50 Where if I just tell you something, then you immediately get it.
00:30:55 But if you have to think about it a little bit to get it, then it sticks with you longer
00:30:59 and it lingers in your mind.
00:31:01 And that's why so many of what we consider artistic masterpieces are things that are complicated.
00:31:07 Because when it's simple, you don't ruminate on it for very long.
00:31:10 You just consume it and it's over.
00:31:12 But you know, if you're watching like Neon Genesis Evangelion and there's images in
00:31:17 that show that only mean something once you've seen the whole show twice or you've really
00:31:22 thought about it and you've really connected with it on this deep level, you'll remember
00:31:26 that for a lot longer.
00:31:31 And it's not necessarily that I think that those works are more valuable, but I do think
00:31:39 that they are more valued.
00:31:41 I think that people put more stock in that stuff.
00:31:43 I think people will talk about it for longer, they'll consider it to be a more important
00:31:49 part of their lives, they'll remember it forever.
00:31:53 And while I think I stay in people's minds because I make this consistent output that
00:31:58 I'm always making new videos and talking about new ideas and perspectives, I don't think
00:32:04 I've made a lot of stuff that if I stopped producing shit today, people would keep bringing
00:32:10 it up forever.
00:32:12 I think there's a few things that would get brought up a lot.
00:32:15 The asterisk war sucks, the sword online sucks.
00:32:17 Those will keep being mentioned for years if I stopped making stuff.
00:32:22 People would bring it up every once in a while in an argument, maybe a few of my other videos.
00:32:26 But most of it is stuff that matters in the moment.
00:32:30 You internalize the message and you forget the video.
00:32:33 And I see all the time, or some of the stuff that I consider the most important parts of
00:32:38 my message, people have to be reminded of it.
00:32:41 I'll bring up some video I made and people will be like, oh yeah, that video.
00:32:46 And even though they've already been using quotes from that video from then on, they
00:32:51 don't remember that the video itself existed.
00:32:53 It happens to me too.
00:32:54 I forget a lot of the stuff I've written.
00:32:57 Sometimes I go back and watch a video from two years ago that I forgot about and I'm
00:33:01 shocked that it makes points that I am still thinking about and forgot I made before.
00:33:08 I have that experience fairly regularly.
00:33:11 Because I haven't written a book that everyone remembers that conveys that message so perfectly
00:33:19 that you never forget that that's what you consumed.
00:33:26 So that's what I stay hung up on as a writer.
00:33:29 And I've kind of been worried lately and I get this worry all the time when I start
00:33:36 making stuff that's more specific that the further I get away from that kind of emotional
00:33:42 resonance, the less people are going to care about what I have to say.
00:33:47 Because with Shinbo in the 90s, that's a passion project for me because I love looking
00:33:53 at directors.
00:33:54 I love looking at that kind of intimate data stuff.
00:33:57 It's basically just data crunching.
00:33:59 It's just me consuming a lot of data, crunching it down and informing you of the same data.
00:34:04 But there's almost no emotional resonance to it.
00:34:08 There's no heartfelt slant, especially with Shinbo because there's so little to say about
00:34:15 him other than his stylistic trappings.
00:34:19 With Hideaki Anno, I could really get into the heart of what this creator was trying
00:34:25 to do and say with his work and it had a lot of emotional resonance.
00:34:30 Shinbo doesn't have that.
00:34:32 And I'm worried that if I started focusing on Shinbo, like if I made a bunch of videos
00:34:37 about him and made that the focus of my channel for a while, people would stop seeing me as
00:34:45 someone making interesting artistic points that resonate with them.
00:34:50 When I make a really great video, people, it resonates with people.
00:34:53 And if it didn't resonate with people, they wouldn't give me money on Patreon.
00:34:58 They wouldn't follow me on Reddit and stuff.
00:35:02 The kind of stuff that makes people a fan of you is the kind of stuff that touches them
00:35:08 on some kind of emotional level.
00:35:10 And I think I've done that before and I don't think I'm going to do it with Shinbo in the
00:35:13 90s.
00:35:14 I don't think anyone's going to get emotional about that.
00:35:17 So even though it's a great technical work of data crunching, even though it's very academic
00:35:23 and great as someone compared it to a Wikipedia article, and I was like, you know, it is like
00:35:30 a Wikipedia article, but I like Wikipedia articles.
00:35:34 And what's important about this one is that I'm the one writing the Wikipedia article.
00:35:39 I'm the one constructing all the data.
00:35:41 I'm the one compiling it.
00:35:42 I'm the one writing the article.
00:35:44 But it is ultimately a Wikipedia article.
00:35:47 And Wikipedia is a website that has so much trouble getting people to see it as more than
00:35:53 a utility that they always have to do these fucking huge donation funds to keep the website
00:35:59 running.
00:36:00 Because everyone uses Wikipedia, but no one wants to pay for it because no one thinks of
00:36:04 it as like a deep, important part of their life.
00:36:08 You know?
00:36:09 Granted, I do.
00:36:10 I always give money to those Wikipedia fundraisers, but you know, I don't want people to necessarily
00:36:19 see me that way.
00:36:20 I don't want people to start looking at me as just a repository for information, but
00:36:24 one that's not like actually giving you something meaningful and personal because I like being
00:36:31 able to provide those things.
00:36:36 So I always feel like I have to strike a balance.
00:36:38 And that's why I constantly feel like I have to be taking on like this multitude of projects
00:36:44 where there's one half of me that's like, you need to make the biggest research project
00:36:48 ever.
00:36:49 And then there's the other half that's like, you need to make the biggest emotional like
00:36:54 meta, you know, make people think about themselves and their lives thing ever.
00:36:59 And it's great when those things can come to a head.
00:37:03 Something like the asterisk war sucks is a lot of those things coming to a head.
00:37:08 Every post in it is very emotional.
00:37:10 It's like, you know, here's how to write a good main character.
00:37:14 That's very relatable, very like everyone wants to know who's the worst anime character
00:37:18 in history, you know, who, how do you write a bad setting?
00:37:22 What's what's wrong with this studio?
00:37:24 Whoa, this show is good and that one's bad.
00:37:26 Like the fucking the chivalry of a failed night comparison is like, it's poetry that
00:37:32 I was able to find that connection.
00:37:34 Like that had nothing to do with me pure luck that those two shows aired at the same time
00:37:39 and were so parallel and that they could have such a strong narrative together that these
00:37:45 two shows like that one could be so bad and one could be okay and yet be almost all the
00:37:50 same components.
00:37:51 I could not have possibly asked for something better than that.
00:37:55 I will never top the level of beautiful coincidence that allowed me to write that piece because
00:38:02 it's so narratively strong, even though it's an analysis, even though it's data crunching,
00:38:07 it has the strongest narrative to it and I'll never get something that, you know, that perfect
00:38:14 again.
00:38:15 But I can still string narratives out of analysis, you know, and the next thing I've written
00:38:22 about Shinbo does, I did write a little bit more narrative into it a little bit more here's
00:38:27 why you should care about this as opposed to here's just a bunch of data, you know.
00:38:34 And yeah, like as I read these classic novels and classic literature and stuff and I feel
00:38:40 like people don't like this for the data.
00:38:44 They like it because it's memorable because it sticks with you because the things it makes
00:38:48 you think about are presented in such a way where oftentimes it's just that one sentence
00:38:53 that one perfectly worded sentence in the middle of, you know, of a chapter where suddenly
00:38:59 it like clicks into place and you totally get the point and it's put so eloquently that
00:39:03 you'll never forget that phrasing and, you know, I want to have moments like that.
00:39:15 Now continuing on the subject of the previous podcast, I listened to it back and I couldn't
00:39:22 help but feel like, wow, I come off as arrogant to the point of borderline megalomaniacal in
00:39:31 this podcast.
00:39:33 And you know, if there's one criticism I get a lot of it's that I'm arrogant and egotistical.
00:39:41 That's by far the most common thing that gets brought out against me and I completely agree
00:39:47 with it.
00:39:49 But it's funny because I feel like I don't know if that's something that I could change
00:39:56 or if that I'd be, if I'd be better without it.
00:40:00 I think it's kind of a matter of there's just certain people who aren't going to like you
00:40:05 in this world, you know.
00:40:07 When people criticize me for being arrogant, all I can think is, yes, I am arrogant.
00:40:14 Like there's nothing I could do about that.
00:40:17 Like it feels weird as a criticism for me because it's not a constructive criticism.
00:40:24 It's basically you're explaining why you don't like me and it's totally understandable.
00:40:29 But to say that like, you know, he needs to be less arrogant.
00:40:34 It's like, I can't just do that.
00:40:38 It's how I am.
00:40:39 And it's because, and I'm sure I've explained this somewhere before, but I'm going to put
00:40:44 it, I'm going to put it in clear terms here and explain from the beginning.
00:40:49 I've mentioned before that I grew up being told that I was a genius.
00:40:53 My parents told me that I was a genius.
00:40:55 They took me to a doctor.
00:40:57 I was about two years old.
00:40:59 They actually thought, because I acted so weird, they thought I wonder if he has autism because
00:41:04 autism was the craze of the times, early 90s autism starting to take off as a thing that
00:41:09 gets diagnosed.
00:41:10 They take me to the doctor and the doctor says, I don't think he has autism.
00:41:14 I think he's a genius.
00:41:16 So they become convinced I'm a genius and they tell me as much my whole life.
00:41:19 And I learned things a little faster than other kids, you know, but I also had weird
00:41:23 habits and tendencies like lining up cars.
00:41:28 I would just take all the cars I had and line them up by size and do that obsessively all
00:41:32 day, make sure all the lines were perfect, you know, very sort of autistic way of acting.
00:41:39 And if I reflect on myself from any point up through high school, possibly even up through
00:41:44 my first job, and I've taken like, you know, Asperger's quizzes on lines and got like,
00:41:50 you know, like you definitely have Asperger's scores until I started working on YouTube
00:41:55 and a lot of the things that I used to do, I completely don't anymore.
00:41:59 And I don't think I would qualify even slightly at this point, which is weird.
00:42:05 But I do think it's considered a thing that you can kind of grow out of to some extent,
00:42:11 like it's considered something that's more amongst young people to have.
00:42:15 I don't know if that's just because more young people are diagnosed or what, but I don't
00:42:19 know, it's odd.
00:42:20 But in any case, I was raised being told I was a genius, so I believed it.
00:42:26 And all throughout school, every year, everyone, you know, people constantly ragged on me and
00:42:32 made fun of me and hated me for this or that reason.
00:42:35 And I saw it as they're all wrong about me.
00:42:38 I know that I'm a genius, so everyone else must be an idiot.
00:42:42 But then when I got into high school, it kind of flipped on its head just a little bit.
00:42:48 Not that I thought I was any less intelligent, but I thought that clearly it's my fault I'm
00:42:54 not popular, you know, to like, to flip on the Tomoko, no matter how I look at it, it's
00:43:01 your fault I'm not popular.
00:43:03 I didn't feel that way.
00:43:04 I felt like me being smarter than everyone else was not working to my benefit, you know,
00:43:11 because I think that it's sort of what separated me from like the classic idea of the fedora,
00:43:16 of the like the the Elliot Roger, where Elliot Roger said, you know, I'm perfect.
00:43:22 So if everyone else doesn't like me, it must be because they're all terrible.
00:43:27 But I saw it as, you know, I'm perfect, but I shouldn't be perfect.
00:43:34 I should be like those people, you know, clearly they're happier the way they are, and I shouldn't
00:43:40 be the way I am.
00:43:41 I probably wasn't this well thought out, you know, when I was that age.
00:43:46 I'm able now as a guy who's able to put things into very easy, clear terms to like put it
00:43:52 that way.
00:43:53 I would not have been able to describe it this way at that age.
00:43:57 But I definitely felt like I was an outsider and I was wrong for being an outsider.
00:44:02 This was all my fault, but I wasn't changing it, you know, I wouldn't change anything.
00:44:06 I was never willing to like give an inch.
00:44:09 I just was like hoping that one day I'd run into someone who accepted me for who I was,
00:44:15 you know, I always thought, you know, I'm not going to go and change myself to try to fit
00:44:20 other people.
00:44:21 I'm going to wait until someone accepts me for who I am.
00:44:24 But until then, I'm I'm just going to be this lonely, sad sack of shit.
00:44:32 And now I'm famous and everybody loves me.
00:44:35 So basically when I was 16, I remember coming up with this phrase, I'm sure I've repeated
00:44:45 this, that if I can't do what I want, then I'm going to kill myself.
00:44:52 Because the way I saw it is that life, normal life to me was nothing but depressing.
00:44:59 It was just a bad time.
00:45:01 Trying to act normal, trying to act like other people only made things worse.
00:45:07 You know, if I had tried to dress differently or act differently or get into different things
00:45:13 than what I liked or to get a normal job that I didn't want to do, all of those things were
00:45:17 only going to make me even more unhappy than I already was.
00:45:22 So the only way I was ever going to be happy is if I did something I wanted to do.
00:45:28 You know, if I did a job I wanted to do, if I worked creatively, if I got to live my passions,
00:45:34 if I got to act how I want to act.
00:45:38 And I really thought that life was not worth living otherwise.
00:45:42 Like what's the point of living if you're not going to be happy?
00:45:46 You know, if you're not going to be as happy as you can be, or as you want to be.
00:45:51 If I'm going to feel like I'm not achieving my full potential, my whole life, that I'm
00:45:58 never going to be happy about it.
00:46:00 So I might as well just kill myself.
00:46:03 Why live if your life sucks?
00:46:07 That was my logic.
00:46:09 So I went about it as let's never do anything other than what I want.
00:46:14 And for years I struggled with, you know, like, I mean it was a long time before I got off
00:46:22 my feet.
00:46:23 And I still did it young.
00:46:24 You know, I was like 23 when my YouTube career really took off.
00:46:29 But you know, between when I graduated high school at 17 and started taking off on YouTube
00:46:35 at 23, was just a whole lot of me doing things I didn't want to do.
00:46:40 All while thinking I'm just working towards the thing I want.
00:46:44 You know, in the background I'm working towards the thing I actually want to be doing.
00:46:48 And eventually I was doing the thing I actually wanted to be doing.
00:46:51 And that's when I, you know, I felt good ever since.
00:46:54 I felt good about life.
00:46:57 But I still have to maintain that.
00:47:01 You know, I still have to be convinced that what I'm doing is right and that I like what
00:47:08 I'm doing and that I like where my life is going.
00:47:11 Because if I wasn't convinced of those things, then laying under that just one layer deeper
00:47:16 is a person who thinks that if I'm not feeling that way, I might as well be dead.
00:47:22 That's still a person who lives down there.
00:47:24 You know, the guy who has attempted suicide in the past.
00:47:30 Someone who, you know, went to the hospital to try to have them put me on suicide watch.
00:47:37 The kind of person who was so anxious and so paranoid about everything that I would just
00:47:42 not leave my room sometimes, you know, for long periods and just, and not talk to anyone
00:47:48 about any problems I was having and bottle it all up.
00:47:52 That person's still down there.
00:47:54 And the only thing that I can do to keep them at bay is to constantly convince myself that
00:48:00 I'm doing things right and that I'm happy with where things are going.
00:48:04 And that's easy to do when I'm doing exactly what I always hoped I would be doing, which
00:48:08 is what I am doing.
00:48:11 But to try and speak of something else would be dishonest.
00:48:15 To try and say, like, to try and act humble or something.
00:48:20 That's not reflective of how I feel because how I feel is like I'm amazing and I'm on
00:48:25 top of the world and everything's perfect because if I didn't feel that way, then it
00:48:29 would just, it would just regress to how it was before, you know?
00:48:37 So to me, the arrogance and the ego is what's keeping me afloat.
00:48:43 And it's not a facade, it's all completely honest and I have to be honest because being
00:48:50 honest is the thing I always wanted to do.
00:48:52 It's the thing, it's the way I wanted to live my life, was do honesty.
00:48:56 And if I started, you know, lying about it, then it would just be dragging me back down.
00:49:02 Like, I would be depressed about the fact that I was lying and not doing what I want
00:49:06 to do, which is be honest, you know?
00:49:10 And being honest makes me happy, which makes me egotistical, which makes me arrogant.
00:49:16 It's a weird cycle.
00:49:18 And so, like, ultimately, sometimes I feel bad because I recognize the arrogance.
00:49:26 I recognize sometimes when I'm just going, like, so full tilt on the idea that I'm just
00:49:34 amazing and stuff.
00:49:36 And I do hold myself in high regard.
00:49:39 And not to say that I think I'm, like, the best writer or anything like that.
00:49:43 There's tons of people I look up to.
00:49:45 There's tons of people who, I mean, Film Crit Hulk is a perfect example.
00:49:50 I don't think I'm close to the caliber of a writer that he is in terms of being able
00:49:56 to convey very grand emotions in his writing and to really, like, bring this excitement
00:50:02 that after you're done reading one of his things, you're just so excited about what
00:50:06 you just read, you know?
00:50:10 Or on a technical level, I'm not as good as Ghost Lightning, who was, you know, the
00:50:14 guy who sort of trained me in how to write better.
00:50:19 He was just more eloquent, had better words, was better read, you know?
00:50:24 And over time, I will eventually be as good as Ghost Lightning.
00:50:28 Maybe I'll eventually be as good as Film Crit Hulk because I don't think either one of them
00:50:31 is an extraordinary genius who I could never hope to match.
00:50:35 They both are just ten years older than me, you know, and ten years more experience, ten
00:50:40 years more writing, ten years more reading, ten years more knowledge.
00:50:45 And eventually I'll have that, and I think I'll be as good as either of them.
00:50:49 There are some people who I'll probably never be as good as.
00:50:51 I don't think I'll ever be as good a writer as Andrew Hussey of Homestuck because the
00:50:55 way that he writes is this, like, this insane natural extension of his mind.
00:51:03 It's like his whole creativity goes into, yeah, goes into Homestuck and it's just so
00:51:08 much more sprawling and creative than anything I'll probably ever do.
00:51:12 I'll never write something as massive as Homestuck and as influential and as, you know, as wide
00:51:20 appealing or anything like that.
00:51:22 But, you know, he's a very special kind of genius.
00:51:27 But I am nonetheless going to be a great writer.
00:51:31 And I do think that I'm better at writing than most of my contemporaries, most people
00:51:37 my age, most people on YouTube, certainly all anime writers.
00:51:42 You know, I don't see anybody, maybe some text writers, you know, can beat me.
00:51:48 Some people who, I still think that text blogging is a lot ahead of YouTubeing in terms of writing
00:51:56 because I think the kind of people who can YouTube is maybe a different subset from people
00:52:03 who can write well.
00:52:04 You know, there is some crossover but I feel like there's a difference in priorities and
00:52:09 that so many people who figure out how to YouTube well by having a good voice, having
00:52:14 good production values, you know, have not actually figured out how to write well yet.
00:52:20 Some of my friends are kind of on that borderline where I think Hippo, Crit and Best Guy Ever
00:52:25 are both fantastic video makers, not very good writers.
00:52:29 Great at coming up with stuff in video form that I'd never think of, you know, both great
00:52:34 editors, far better editors than I have ever been.
00:52:37 You know, Hippo can make jokes out of the creativity of how he films things and the
00:52:44 creativity of how he edits things and performs things that that's half the joke, you know.
00:52:49 He can take a joke that is just badly written and deliver it so hilariously that it becomes
00:52:56 a good joke, you know, and Best Guy Ever can edit his fucking, he can edit anything.
00:53:01 He knows his way around the programs perfectly.
00:53:04 I don't have those skills but I can definitely write most people under the table and the
00:53:10 only person I know who is better at writing than me in the video world is Endless Jess.
00:53:17 He's the only person who's more clever, more, you know, more intimately connected to the
00:53:25 written word and that's because Jesse writes way more than he video produces.
00:53:31 He has like hundreds of unreleased scripts.
00:53:34 He writes blog posts on Patreon now.
00:53:38 He's written tons of shit.
00:53:39 I've seen his writing on Facebook where he would write these rants and stuff.
00:53:42 Jesse's always been more of a writer and also more of a reader than most everyone I know.
00:53:48 He reads a lot more books.
00:53:50 He's just better with the language than I am.
00:53:53 Mr. Betung is better with the language than I am so far.
00:53:58 I don't think I would have too much catching up to do to him but he's definitely better
00:54:02 with the language than I am.
00:54:04 Those are the only people I know of on YouTube who I can definitively say that about, who
00:54:08 I watch and I go, that guy's a better writer than me, you know.
00:54:14 So yes, I am arrogant but I also see myself in a place, in a place, in a gradient and
00:54:22 not everyone would agree with the gradient.
00:54:23 Not everybody would put everyone in the same places that I do but when you think of yourself
00:54:31 the way I do, I think for a lot of people who are looking at it from the outside, they
00:54:35 just see a bunch of titans.
00:54:39 Anyone who writes at all, anyone who's a creative, they are just these gods far above
00:54:45 and if they don't really like you, like, you know, if someone doesn't really like my writing
00:54:50 and I compare myself to a writer who they do like, they see it as like, how dare you,
00:54:56 this lowly plebeian, compare yourself to one of the exalted gods, you know.
00:55:03 When I get that, but for me as a writer, I see myself as working my way up a ladder,
00:55:09 a ladder of writers.
00:55:10 If I go up one rung, bam, I've grasped the rung that puts me above this other guy, you
00:55:16 know.
00:55:17 When I started writing video, I would have put myself on the level of errant signal and,
00:55:22 well, Egoraptor might have been a much better video producer than me, for sure.
00:55:27 But like, in terms of writing, I would have put myself around Egoraptor, errant signal
00:55:31 and stuff.
00:55:32 Now I think I'm better than them.
00:55:33 I do think I'm a better writer than errant signal, whose style has not progressed almost
00:55:38 at all in the time I've been watching him, he makes very little progress.
00:55:43 And Egoraptor, who just stopped writing about three or four years ago, and for whom writing
00:55:49 is a very laborious process as I understand it.
00:55:53 So you know, I'm making progress, I'm climbing the ladder, one day I'll be able to write
00:55:58 as well as Beton, one day unless Beton continues improving, one day I'll be able to write as
00:56:03 well as Ghost Lightning and Film Crit Hulk, and maybe if I'm fucking lucky, I'll be able
00:56:10 to write as well as Jesse, but I do think Jesse is also still improving and still hashing
00:56:15 out whole new ways of writing and whole new creativities.
00:56:19 So I think with him, I'll be chasing a moving object that might even be moving faster than
00:56:25 I am.
00:56:27 But still, as a writer, this is how you think of yourself.
00:56:30 I am in that world.
00:56:32 I am a professional.
00:56:33 This is my job.
00:56:36 Whether you think I can write well or not, the fact is that I'm a professional writer.
00:56:44 How do you want to measure it?
00:56:45 Do you want to measure it by your personal taste, or do you want to measure it by accomplishment?
00:56:53 I've got 250,000 subscribers.
00:56:56 I make a middle-class wage doing what I do.
00:57:01 I live happily.
00:57:04 I can't think of an oculod that you wouldn't ascribe to me other than something that is
00:57:11 very personal to you.
00:57:13 So yes, I'm arrogant, but I also have accomplished the things that make someone arrogant.
00:57:22 I've been there.
00:57:23 I've been to the mountain, and if you think that that's nothing special, then I agree.
00:57:32 I think that the arrogance is not necessary for having completed these tasks, but it is
00:57:40 what gets me through life.
00:57:42 It's how I see myself, and I see myself as I need to be this way in order to keep making
00:57:48 progress.
00:57:49 If I don't see myself as getting better, if I don't see myself as trying to climb towards
00:57:54 these gods, then I'll never reach those gods.
00:58:01 I think if you're the kind of person who's sitting around saying, like, I can't compare
00:58:05 myself to the greats, how can you ever hope to be like the greats?
00:58:10 And that's all I want, is to be the best I can possibly be, and if I can possibly be
00:58:16 as great as the greats, then I gotta keep climbing and keep looking at myself as someone
00:58:21 who's gotten better, and is good, and is doing everything to put me on that path.
00:58:31 I intended to go into that rant more apologetically, but I ended up coming out of it more arrogant
00:58:36 than ever before, so hopefully at least this seems like it's probably an interesting podcast.
00:58:43 This has all been one recording so far, so I'm gonna go pass out now, and maybe there'll
00:58:50 be more from another day.
00:58:56 So it's October 7th now, the day that probably this video will come out, the night rather.
00:59:04 I recorded the whole first hour of this all on the 4th, and it's kind of funny to think
00:59:12 of this as a show that, you know, because I put dates on it, and it's always like a
00:59:18 specific day, but it's being recorded for the whole week, so you should really think
00:59:22 of it as the week of November 7th, that the video comes out, or that the video represents
00:59:30 rather than the day.
00:59:32 But the reason I chose to use dates is because I find numbering everything boring, you know,
00:59:38 I have a lot of, I've always kind of presented numbered shows on YouTube, because it implies
00:59:44 that you have to watch them in a certain order, and I hate that when it's a show that you
00:59:49 don't have to watch in a certain order, and I just think it's a bad way to go about things,
00:59:53 because if you number everything, people aren't gonna go back and find number one to start
00:59:58 from there.
00:59:59 Now I have numbered some shows on After Dark, mostly because I don't take it that seriously,
01:00:03 those videos, or like the first one kind of explains the concept, and you might as well
01:00:08 watch them in order and why not kind of thing, but I generally don't like numbered series
01:00:15 that much.
01:00:16 The Procrastinators is numbered kind of unnecessarily, like you don't really have to listen to them
01:00:22 in order, and nobody does, so the numbers are just kind of there to keep track of how
01:00:26 many we've done.
01:00:27 But with this podcast I thought, why not just label each one with a date, so you can tell
01:00:32 them apart, they don't have to have unique titles, but they're not numbered.
01:00:37 And it kind of implies that it's a diary, you know, because it's really, it's pretty
01:00:42 much like if I had a diary, this is the kind of stuff I'd be putting in it, you know, and
01:00:47 these days I am much more liable to record something than I am to write something.
01:00:53 I mean like the way I treat vlogs now is how I used to treat Tumblr back in the day, like
01:00:57 how, you know, I'd get a random idea that wasn't quite enough for like a video, but
01:01:02 a little too much for a tweet, I'd make a Tumblr post about it, nowadays I would make
01:01:06 a vlog, or a podcast, and this podcast in particular is like super, you know, personal
01:01:14 diary stories, so I think it makes sense to give them dates.
01:01:19 In other news, I've felt better again ever since I started vaping, talked about that
01:01:24 earlier in this episode, that I went out, wait did I mention that I went out and bought
01:01:29 a vape?
01:01:30 I think I did in the early part, I think that was the day I had done it, and I felt great
01:01:35 ever since, so that problem's out of the way.
01:01:40 Vaping is super fun, although it is annoying because I keep doing it during podcasts and
01:01:44 stuff and then not realizing how loud it is until listening to those back, so I'm gonna
01:01:50 try to curb that habit a little bit, try to make it to, it's just that it's such an ideal
01:01:55 time because I'm not doing a lot of other stuff, you know, especially if I have somebody
01:01:58 else with me and I have to like listen to them, then you know, it's like what do I do
01:02:01 with my hands while listening to them?
01:02:04 You know, like on the pub crawl, we always drink when the other person's talking, you
01:02:08 know, that's how we end up getting so drunk on the show, it's just whoever's not talking
01:02:11 is usually drinking.
01:02:15 But I felt good the last few days, I've kind of become a real comic book boy in a way that
01:02:24 I've always wanted to and never did until now, and it's really entirely because of now
01:02:31 I understand how comics work, I don't remember if I mentioned this in another episode, that
01:02:36 like, you know, Jesse started up the panel cast and it got me looking into individual
01:02:41 comics and what I realized as I was reading through Gwenpool and The Vision, like shortly
01:02:46 after reading The Vision, it suddenly became very clear to me that comic books almost always
01:02:52 come out in these like one or two volume stories, like even if it's a long running comic, like
01:02:59 I've always been under the impression that you really have, like there's these long runners
01:03:04 that have been going on forever and you have to read the whole fucking thing, all 80 volumes
01:03:08 or the endless, the endless annals of this comic book, you know, in order to understand
01:03:12 it, and I think it doesn't help that I was into DC, because when I tried to get into
01:03:17 comics in 2012, it was because the New 52 had just started, and like, the thing about
01:03:25 New 52 is that it was like a complete reboot of the entire DC universe, so I thought, well
01:03:29 that's a really easy way for me to get into it, I mean that's exactly what they were going
01:03:33 for, is to get a bunch of new comic book readers to have an easy end and not feel like they
01:03:37 had to catch up on 80 years of continuity, you know, and so I'd read, you know, a few
01:03:43 of the ones that interested me, I read Batwoman, which I love, Swamp Thing was, Animal Man
01:03:48 was okay, and there was a couple others I read, but like, because it was so early on,
01:03:55 I was under the impression that like, I'm just going to be reading these forever, like
01:03:59 this is a, this new comic has started up, and it's going to keep going and going and
01:04:03 going until the end of time, you know, and it will switch artists weirdly and randomly
01:04:07 and I won't know what's going on sometimes. I didn't realize that the way comics really
01:04:12 work is more like, you know, like the comic will keep going on forever, but it's like
01:04:16 these little stories that are then later collected into graphic novels, or their stand-alones
01:04:22 and stuff like that, and there's tons of those, and a lot of them are the most interesting,
01:04:26 a lot of the best stories are just like these little one volume things that are meant to
01:04:31 be graphic novels and shit like that, and I never realized how much of comics was like
01:04:37 that. So, you know, now I'm looking at, like I've been reading a bunch of stuff where I
01:04:43 just pick some, some series, you know, some part of a series, and I just read that, and
01:04:47 I'm like, oh, okay, now I've completed that whole thing and I have a better understanding
01:04:52 of the characters and what's going on. Jesse recommended this one Silver Surfer comic with
01:04:57 like unbelievably gorgeous artwork. It's only four issues. It was about the death of Silver
01:05:02 Surfer, and it was fucking epic and cool, and now I, I understand Silver Surfer, and then,
01:05:07 um, you know, did the same thing with a few others, and the one that was most interesting
01:05:13 is just yesterday, I went out and saw Doctor Strange, and it was the first time that I
01:05:18 ever felt like I understood what comic book fans feel when they watch a comic book movie,
01:05:26 because I, I've heard stuff like Kevin Smith on his podcast where he talks about, like,
01:05:32 um, how he'll, he'll go out and see like Batman v Superman, and just the fact that this one
01:05:39 kind of character shows up was enough to justify the whole movie's existence to him. Like, even
01:05:45 though he admitted to all these flaws in the movie, like, the fact that that thing was
01:05:48 there made it interesting and worth seeing, and like, that's something I couldn't relate
01:05:52 to at all. But with this Doctor Strange movie, I was like, I, I went into it and I, I watched
01:05:57 it, it was okay, it's a, it's a decent movie, and just like any other Marvel movie, I mean,
01:06:02 my impression of all the Marvel movies is basically, yeah, that's a fun time, but they're
01:06:06 all pretty much the exact same thing, I'm, I'm very sick of the, the formula of them,
01:06:11 but what made it different this time was that I watched it because I was curious about Doctor
01:06:15 Strange, because I had just read in Gwenpool where Doctor Strange shows up and he seemed
01:06:20 really cool, and then he was in the Silver Surfer comic and he seemed really cool, and
01:06:24 I was like, man, I kind of want to read Doctor Strange, so then I go out and I see this movie,
01:06:28 and now I know the whole backstory of Doctor Strange, I didn't know any of it, I knew nothing
01:06:32 about him other than that he was like, basically a time lord, you know, that's like all I knew,
01:06:38 so now I know his whole backstory, and like, in the context of seeing the movie, that wouldn't
01:06:43 have been that exciting, it would have been like, alright, well, now I know about another
01:06:47 superhero guy, whatever, but where it got exciting was I came home and I immediately read the
01:06:52 whole current run of Doctor Strange that started last year, so 13 issues, the first 10 of which
01:06:58 comprise a pretty open and shut story, like, the story is still, like, the current story continues
01:07:04 from where that one left off, but it's like, it's a definitively different chapter, you know,
01:07:09 it's a new story, it's got a new artist who's not nearly as good as the other one, but like,
01:07:13 what was great about it was I picked up this comic and like, it takes place, you know,
01:07:17 pretty far into Doctor Strange's narrative, but I now know who all these characters are,
01:07:23 like, I completely got it, I knew who everyone was, why they were important, and I was like,
01:07:27 sweet, you know, all I needed to catch up on was like, the little subtle changes between the
01:07:31 film and comic interpretations, so yeah, it was really neat, and I got to read that comic,
01:07:37 and I think I appreciated it more because I'd seen the origin story, and the comic is even
01:07:43 better than the movie, because the movie has the problems of following, you know, the Marvel
01:07:47 Cinematic Universe formula too much, and being, well, very trippy for a mainstream movie, not
01:07:54 that trippy compared to what you would find in a comic book, whereas the comic is like,
01:08:00 especially trippy even for a comic book, you know, like, when I was watching that film,
01:08:06 I was thinking, this is kind of epic in a way that's not unlike how Silver Surfer was epic,
01:08:12 because Silver Surfer had these like, crazy-ass ideas, he's like, these high-minded sci-fi concepts
01:08:16 just thrown about, you know, and the movie kind of does that, but the comic of Doctor Strange,
01:08:22 like, the whole point of it is that it's just non-stop insanity, like, because Doctor Strange's
01:08:26 world is one of just like, you know, mind-breaking horror at all times, so yeah, I think the film
01:08:37 does a good job of like, broaching the subject of Doctor Strange, whereas the comic really fulfills
01:08:44 the promise of Doctor Strange in a way, so yeah, it was pretty cool, and I read the comic, I really
01:08:50 liked it, particularly the first part, the new storyline that it's now going into isn't as
01:08:55 interesting, but I'll keep up with it for a while, you know, probably read some other older Doctor
01:08:59 Strange stories that are good, you know, and check out, check out what's out there, but now I just
01:09:06 feel so much more acclimated to what comics are, and like, how to explore that medium, you know,
01:09:12 that I can read it in these little bite-sized chunks, and like, most of them involve other
01:09:17 characters, so I can, you know, start to feel out who they are, like, I got interested in Doctor
01:09:22 Strange because he was in Gwenpool and Silver Surfer, and even those characters I now only know
01:09:31 so much about, and I'd like to see more of them, you know, Scarlet Witch plays a big role in the
01:09:35 Vision comic, Scarlet Witch is also in Doctor Strange, so now I'm curious about Scarlet Witch,
01:09:40 I might read her thing, you know, so yeah, it's a cool way to just jump into this web,
01:09:46 and like, find your way around, and I think I like the Marvel stuff more than the DC stuff,
01:09:51 it could just be that I haven't read the best DC stories, you know, like, Batwoman, what I kind
01:09:56 of liked about it was that it was not super connected to everything else, and I mean, it becomes sort
01:10:00 of tied up in the whole Batman thing, you know, obviously it's related to Batman, but she was
01:10:04 pretty individual, and I didn't feel like I had to know too many other things in order to appreciate
01:10:10 it, but with the Marvel universe, I feel more inclined to explore all these different people
01:10:17 and find out about them and why they're important to one another, and I'm sure at some point it'll,
01:10:23 like, the whole broken continuity thing will shatter my mind to pieces, but honestly,
01:10:28 it doesn't bother me that much because I kind of see each individual comic as like a parallel
01:10:33 universe from the last one, like, I can't really, like, I read Doctor Strange, and I've read Gwenpool,
01:10:41 and I don't think that they necessarily, like, it doesn't make sense to have them in the same timeline,
01:10:46 like, I don't know at what, like, Doctor Strange is definitely the same character in both stories,
01:10:52 but with what's going on in the Doctor Strange story, he couldn't possibly appear as he does
01:10:58 in the Gwenpool story, so when does her story even take place in comparison to his?
01:11:02 When does any of, it's such like a temporal fuckfest, like, to even read two comics that,
01:11:07 for me, it's easier to just compartmentalize each of them as just a totally different comic
01:11:12 that happens to overlap in some ways with another one, you know, kind of like reading or watching
01:11:19 everything by a clamp if you're an anime fan who knows clamp, like, they had the same characters
01:11:24 would appear in all these different stories, but not necessarily make sense in them.
01:11:28 Now, what's, what it's given me to get into comics is something great, because I've long
01:11:36 wanted to explore every medium. I want to be someone who is cultured in every, like, you know,
01:11:43 main medium of art, and part of it is because I want to see all these different interesting
01:11:50 ideas and, you know, explore all these things and be able to have conversations about them,
01:11:54 but also a more selfish part is that all of it helps me to justify anime, because I explain
01:12:01 this in my video, like, is anything deep, where when I consume stuff in other mediums that is
01:12:06 considered to be deep, it never actually feels like, like, like anime is any less deep, and I
01:12:13 feel like there's this, this cultural idea in every medium that, like, this medium's deeper than
01:12:19 that one. This one's got more going on, and I think right now, the medium that's the most
01:12:24 pretentious is film, because even though we've got this whole, like, actually it might even be
01:12:29 spurned on by this whole Marvel universe thing, where there's all these big Marvel popcorn movies,
01:12:34 and it's really created this heavy divide in the film communities of people who, because they see
01:12:40 those movies, they now are, like, overcompensating on loving the, the, the so-called masterpieces,
01:12:47 the, like, you know, the super deep films and stuff, and the artsy stuff, and I feel like there's
01:12:53 this overcompensation happening to really celebrate the super deep stuff, and to present it, like,
01:12:58 it's this high-brow shit, whereas other mediums, I feel like there's, there's not so much of a divide
01:13:06 between the, the popcorn stuff and the deep stuff, that, like, stuff can bridge that gap fairly easily,
01:13:12 and anime bridges that gap constantly, where I really think that shows, like, Kill A Kill or
01:13:18 Guru on the Gone have some of the deepest stories I've ever seen, you know, in any medium, and they
01:13:25 can do that while still being something that can also entertain and be, be fairly normal, you know,
01:13:32 whereas in other mediums, like, film, and there are, there are films that do this well, Speed Racer,
01:13:37 great example, deep story, high intensity, fun, you know, wacky kind of presentation,
01:13:45 that totally works with the nature of the story, but I feel like a lot of people feel this pressure
01:13:50 that a film has to either be, or it has to be, you know, like, there's, there's, there's a lack of
01:13:58 the middle ground that should be there, that other mediums are exploring well, and the more I read,
01:14:04 and this is especially true when I read books and fiction, because I've been reading a little bit
01:14:09 more fiction the last, the last couple weeks, and as, I'm not going to say which story, because
01:14:16 there's some I haven't finished yet, and I don't want to jinx myself by saying that I'm reading it,
01:14:20 and then that'll make me never finish it, but I did finish Brave New World, which I hadn't read
01:14:25 before, and that was pretty great, and like, as I read fiction that is some of which is considered
01:14:30 to be super deep, I find that it actually has a much better approach to like, mixing high and
01:14:38 lowbrow kind of ideas, where like, the stories that are considered classics, the ones that are
01:14:43 like really heralded as high art pieces, are not pretentious about it, none of them are these like
01:14:48 stuffy, classy, oh, everything is the, the, the, the perfect, oh, the cinematography, the blocking,
01:14:56 like, it's not quite like that, most of it's actually a lot more experimental in free form,
01:15:00 like the books that people really celebrate are usually the ones that combine like really
01:15:05 heady and interesting ideas with like, this very human, like, rough and gritty kind of feeling,
01:15:14 you know, and, and those are the, those are the ones that are like considered masterpieces,
01:15:19 whereas I feel like, you know, we do get some films that are kind of like that, but then people
01:15:23 always want to take a step back and be like, oh, well, but you know, like, like something like
01:15:27 District 9 is a great example of a film that, that's very dirty and very homey, you know, and
01:15:33 like low budget and gritty, but also has this big message, but even with that movie, I feel like
01:15:37 people are so hesitant to call that a masterpiece, because of the fact that it's not like a classy
01:15:44 high art movie, you know, and I'm like, but that's, but it's a masterpiece, you know, like, how do you,
01:15:50 like, if you, if this was a book that did the same thing, had the same approach, you would
01:15:54 definitely say it was a masterpiece, you know, um, and anime, I feel like the people, like, people
01:16:02 who, who, who consume other mediums and who are kind of ashamed of anime and like its animanness
01:16:08 are only willing to celebrate the stuff that's like classy, you know, and I talked about that,
01:16:12 this is basically what my boring taste in anime video was all about, this whole idea of like,
01:16:16 people who, you know, only want to present themselves as, oh, well, I like, uh, Mushishi and
01:16:21 Legend of the Galactic Heroes and like all these, ooh, these shows that don't have a bunch of dumb
01:16:25 anime shit, but the anime shit is just, it's just human, it speaks to the human condition
01:16:31 as much as anything else, there's a reason we want to watch shows about this shit, and if you can do
01:16:36 that while still conveying an interesting theme and, uh, and premise, especially if it, if the, the
01:16:42 dumb stuff and the high-minded stuff are combined in a way that makes sense, you've knocked it out
01:16:47 of the park, you know, so, yeah, I really think that, uh, that help, it helps me to appreciate anime
01:16:56 even more, to consume deep works and other mediums, and it's really funny to me that that's the case,
01:17:01 because there's so many people who will tell me like, why do you waste your time and your analytical
01:17:04 skills on anime, you could be, you could be reading, uh, Ulysses, you know, and then I read Ulysses,
01:17:10 and I'm like, this is batshit crazy, like this, this, this is just as crazy as anime is, you know,
01:17:15 like, or people who want me to review like some highbrow film because of its deep cinematography,
01:17:20 and I'm like, yeah, you know, I think anime has great cinematography, I think Ava has the
01:17:26 best cinematography of anything I can fucking think of, you know, um, so yeah, I guess that's the
01:17:32 point I'm making, and it makes, it's really cool when I get to like, read comics and figure out
01:17:37 like, where do they relate to anime and manga, and where do, where do movies relate, where do
01:17:42 books relate, and then I can, uh, sort of have this greater cultural understanding of all of them,
01:17:47 and one day I'll have read enough books and read enough comics that I can actually talk about them
01:17:52 in like, a forum with other people, you know, because I feel like, uh, when I've come to realize
01:17:59 about why I don't do that, why I don't talk to other people about like, comics, because I went on
01:18:04 co, uh, the, the 4chan comics board, and I was looking at some of the impressions of like, Dr. Strange
01:18:10 and stuff, and the co, the conversations are very specific, and everyone's very opinionated,
01:18:15 these are all people with like, deeply held beliefs about these characters and stories,
01:18:19 and like, what they want them to be, and I'm, I realized that I'm kind of afraid of being
01:18:24 influenced by that, like, I don't want, even the panel cast is a little, a little scary,
01:18:30 because like, for instance, Jesse will tell me something like, you know, uh, Lady Thor is terrible,
01:18:36 right, he has all these great justifications for it, but what that creates in my mind is like,
01:18:40 the expectation that if I go read Lady Thor, I should expect it to be terrible, when really,
01:18:45 I might read it on my own, and like, because my values in comics might not end up being the same
01:18:50 as Jesse's, you know, maybe I'll see it in a totally different, right, light, I mean, I have no idea
01:18:55 if that'll be the case with Lady Thor in particular, but like, you know, there's a lot of stuff that I
01:18:59 want to form on my own, without having to confront other people's opinions too much until I've made
01:19:07 it there, and then once I have all my opinions, then I can go into that sparring match, and you
01:19:12 know, with a little bit more confidence, and not let myself be swayed by what everyone else is
01:19:16 already thinking about these shows, or these comics, you know, I'm very, I'm the type of person who,
01:19:22 I feel the need to know, like, to feel comfortable that I know everything about what I'm talking about,
01:19:29 before I talk about it, you know, not that I have to be right about everything, but that I
01:19:32 have to have all the information, and like, I'm so careful, even on Twitter, to even mention
01:19:38 having consumed something, because I don't want to have to, like, if I, I almost tweeted out the
01:19:44 other night, saw Doctor Strange pretty good, then read the comic very good, and what I was afraid of
01:19:51 is that the tweets that I would get in response would either be other people's opinions on Doctor
01:19:56 Strange, people telling me which Doctor Strange comics I should be reading instead of the 2015 one,
01:20:01 people telling me to read just some other comic, or see some other movie, or asking my opinion on
01:20:06 the MCU and all this shit, and I was like, I don't want any of that, I don't want any of that right
01:20:10 now, I want to on my own, find my way through Doctor Strange, and if one day I come to the
01:20:16 conclusion that yes, that comic is not as good as this old one, or maybe I thought the movie
01:20:22 could have done this or that differently, then fine, but you know, I'm not ready yet to have other
01:20:26 people sort of affecting my overall perception of comics, you know, I'm willing to let Jesse
01:20:32 guide me through, because I, he's a trusted tour guide, and someone who, who really wants me to
01:20:38 think comics are cool, you know, he wants people to like comics, so it's important to him that,
01:20:44 that you know, that he not try to, that he not end up ruining it for anybody.
01:20:48 So, so yeah, I think it's, it's, it's a fun, fun little trajectory, and I've talked about this
01:20:58 with The DeVoo plenty of times, that I think I am relatively close to having completed anime.
01:21:10 I think that day is coming in the next three years, and here's what I mean by completed anime.
01:21:15 Um, there is a limit to how many shows I think I need to watch, like there's, there's an end goal
01:21:21 to that, because you know, if you go back to anime history, it only goes so far, the first shows,
01:21:26 you know, the first TV shows are from like the 60s, you know, there's movies going back before
01:21:31 that, but not a whole lot of them. It would not take that long to consume all of the things that
01:21:38 I need to, that I haven't seen yet from history, you know, and then there's also a lot of stuff
01:21:43 that I need to rewatch, to reaffirm my opinions on, to like, you know, to figure out how I feel
01:21:48 about them, and lots of stuff I want to cover with regards to both. There's lots of shows I
01:21:53 haven't seen yet that I want to talk about, lots of big concepts, lots of creators I want to follow,
01:21:57 lots of, and lots of older things I've seen before that I want to cover again, and I think
01:22:04 that in three years, I'll have covered all of it. I think within three years, anything, anything
01:22:12 that exists now that I haven't talked about, that I have an idea for, I will have covered in the
01:22:16 next three years. Now, anime is always coming out, so it's not like I'll ever have no anime to talk
01:22:22 about, and this estimation could be a little short, it could be a little, it could be even, um,
01:22:28 maybe I'm overestimating how long it'll take, you know, because I've knocked, I've had some moments
01:22:34 of knocking something out that, like, for instance, music videos. I watched all of them,
01:22:41 you know, for the sake of that, that video, uh, the ten, ten anime music videos you should check
01:22:46 out. I watched all the anime music videos that are out there, you know, with the exception of, like,
01:22:51 some that are not, uh, professional work, or are, um, just not listed on my anime list for whatever
01:22:58 reason, or are a part of, like, a bigger series that I didn't cover. But I've watched pretty much
01:23:04 every anime music video, so that's done. I just, I don't have to worry about that until new ones
01:23:09 come out and I can take them individually as they come. Um, you know, I watched every shinbo show
01:23:14 from the 90s, that's been on my bucket list forever, you know, that's done. I don't have to watch any
01:23:20 of them ever again, I've already talked about them, you know, there's only a few that I'd really feel
01:23:24 the need to go back to if, even if I wanted to. So yeah, there's a chance that within three years,
01:23:30 I will, I will have finished everything I wanted to do with anime, and I'll still talk about it
01:23:34 forever, but at that point, I'll be ready to branch out into other mediums, and I want to have a
01:23:40 footing in those, you know, I want that in three years, in the same way that, like, when I was
01:23:45 fading out of, uh, doing MLP stuff and fading into anime, like, I started introducing anime videos
01:23:51 in there, and like, started, you know, mixing the pot a little bit, and then I, then at some point,
01:23:55 I was full-blown anime, and it was supposed to be anime and everything else, but there's nothing
01:23:59 else I wanted to talk about as much, but I'd love to eventually, like, bleed in other things, or maybe
01:24:04 there's only one anime video every couple of months, but then in the middle, oh, here's a
01:24:09 interesting film analysis, here's a comic book analysis, here's an analysis of a, of this or
01:24:14 that thing, you know, I want to be an everything guy, not just an anime guy, and, uh, and so it'll
01:24:19 be interesting to see if that day comes, and, like, I've been collecting all these charts, I love
01:24:25 collecting recommendation charts, especially from 4chan, because they make tons of them, and I've
01:24:29 been going to every board and just, like, checking until I find charts, and then downloading all the
01:24:34 charts I can find, and just crossing off anything I've consumed, and it doesn't, like, when you look
01:24:39 at one of those charts and you haven't seen anything on it, it looks huge, but then once you've crossed
01:24:44 off ten things, suddenly it doesn't look that huge, you're like, huh, well, it only took me this
01:24:49 long to cross off ten, how long would it take to cross off the other, you know, 60 or whatever,
01:24:55 well, I guess, I mean, it would just be six times what I just did, and what I just did didn't take
01:24:59 a year, so, what, seven years, that's, you know, a reasonable chunk of time, and that's not consuming
01:25:04 all at once, that's while doing everything else, so I think it's reasonable to assume that I could
01:25:11 eventually become cultured in every medium, and, you know, every time I read a book, every time I
01:25:16 read a comic, I'm one step closer, every time I watch a film, I'm one step closer, there's a
01:25:21 finite number of them out there, at least for the time being, a finite, if you will,
01:25:31 even though infinite is not infinite, well, all right, I wasn't sure if I'd have anything else
01:25:40 to follow up with at the end of this podcast, I'd had a few ideas over the last few days, I don't
01:25:45 think I covered any of them, but I don't remember what they were, so, yeah, that wraps up this,
01:25:51 this episode of the DigiBro decompression chamber, I hope you enjoyed it, I really
01:25:57 felt this was like my strongest one yet, I had a lot of fun with all these topics, so
01:26:03 thanks, thanks for listening, go have a nice day, and, or a nice night, as this one will probably
01:26:09 be released at night, daylight savings time ended, so it's like fucking dark outside, it's not even
01:26:13 six o'clock, have a nice night, listen to this relaxing music, and chill out.
01:27:43 you
