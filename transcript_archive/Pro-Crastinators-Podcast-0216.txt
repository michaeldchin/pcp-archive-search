00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome to the, to the, I remember it, so you don't have to, I remember
00:00:11 to show up to the podcast so you don't have to, it's Ben Saint of the Pro Crastinators
00:00:18 Podcast and it's finally happened, it's finally happened.
00:00:25 Only one person showed up for the fucking call, only, I'm the only one, I'm it, I'm
00:00:34 it, it's just me, it's the legendary one man cast, we've been waiting, we've been waiting,
00:00:41 and now's the time for it to happen, it's just me, it's the just Ben cast here on the
00:00:46 Pro Crastinators Podcast. Remember that, remember Howard Dean? Good times, good times, good
00:00:57 time in my life, the Howard Dean era. Nostalgic, ah fuck, fuck Hippo you recording? Okay, well,
00:01:10 damn it, I'm, Hippo just joined the call, I'm recording, I started recording, I gotta
00:01:23 admit, Hippo, I kinda, I was very tempted not to add everyone to let everyone know that
00:01:31 I was here, and I kinda wish that I had, I kinda wish that, nothing personal, I'm sure
00:01:40 I'm sure you would feel the same way, a sort of sense of regret that had I not added everyone,
00:01:47 the legendary event would have transpired. Yeah, I mean, last week I was feeling the
00:01:53 same way, like, it was gonna be just me, nobody else seemed interested, but I felt like I
00:02:00 should, cause like, sometimes people forget, and also, I mean, I don't know, it's like,
00:02:08 there's only two people, there's only one person, how's the whole podcast gonna come
00:02:11 of this, doesn't really feel like the Pro Crastinators. If I hadn't, you know, everyone, then everyone
00:02:20 would have said, everyone would have said, Ben, why didn't you add everyone, why didn't
00:02:24 you add everyone, Ben, why didn't you, why didn't you take it upon yourself to remind
00:02:31 all of us, you know, and to be fair, I'm sure, normally Nate adds everyone in a normal
00:02:38 episode where he's here and everyone's here and all that shit. So, you know, I guess,
00:02:45 okay, it's fine. I mean, had it just been me, I guess my strategy would have been to,
00:02:55 you know, just kind of, just ramble for a little bit, which I'm sure I could do quite
00:02:59 easily, maybe for like, you know, 15, 30 minutes, you know, just, you know, insult everyone
00:03:07 else, talk about, talk about, you know, do a little self-aware bit where I comment on,
00:03:14 you know, the sorry state of the PCP these days, where this, you know, the, you know,
00:03:23 the, the, the clearly, the clearly defunct, the clearly malfunctioning machine, you know,
00:03:30 which puts, which outputs this, you know, gestures around myself to, to the one man
00:03:36 cast currently transpiring, which puts this out as it's, as its output, you know, as a
00:03:42 way to sort of head off criticism and put myself kind of above it, you know, put, and
00:03:49 then, and then, and then you, and then spend an inordinate amount of time doing like voicemails,
00:03:55 right? And just like go through every voicemail and try to just try, just try and stretch
00:04:03 you to one after as long as I can, you know, just maybe try and hit an hour and a half.
00:04:06 I think, I don't think it would be that hard. Anyway, that was my story. I was thinking about
00:04:12 this as I was sitting in the call, waiting for that mythical, for that mythical three
00:04:17 10 to round the corner.
00:04:25 Yeah, I maybe I shouldn't have jumped in. I don't really have anything to talk about.
00:04:30 Um, no, it's fine. Well, I mean, up to you, I guess. But why don't we talk about, why don't
00:04:40 we talk about last week? It was just you and me last week, right?
00:04:45 Yeah, I was there and then you jumped in immediately as we started recording as I started
00:04:51 writing. And so we talked about comics and and what each of us are doing. I was talking
00:05:02 about getting tired with internet discourse. And I have, I yeah,
00:05:07 getting getting tired of it, tired to the like weary, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:05:13 I wasn't I thought you said hired, like, putting out an ad everyone like, Hey, guys, here's
00:05:18 my resume, you know, you know anyone? No, it's it's it's poisonous. It's poisonous.
00:05:26 It's the worst. I don't like it anymore. Internet discourse. Yeah. Yeah. I've been feeling
00:05:33 the same way. Twitter sucks. Twitter is where I do most of my internet discourse. It sucks.
00:05:40 I need I need to do something about it, though. It's it's it's always such a habit to like,
00:05:46 you know, you know, I go on Twitter, just to see what's going on. And then, you know,
00:05:53 if there's an argument to be had, I decide to jump in usually. Yeah. And it's it's never
00:06:01 good. It's like, sometimes I get through to someone and we reach an understanding, but
00:06:05 more far more often, it's easier to do that in discord than it is on Twitter.
00:06:13 It's just it's just bad. It's just not good. I need to delete my Twitter or do something
00:06:19 drastic that would force me to stop because I'm because I am I'm out of control.
00:06:27 Something drastic, like suicide, for instance.
00:06:32 Don't even talk about that. Don't even talk about that. I've been thinking about it.
00:06:36 I've been thinking about it just a little bit. Oh, God, no. I know. I'm sorry. It's terrible.
00:06:42 It's terrible. I mean, when you say when so what when the words something drastic, that's
00:06:47 the first thing that comes to my head. Well, all right. I'm I'm not like, like on the on the
00:06:54 bridge right now. I'm not like staring down like 50 feet. There's nothing. Yeah. Of that
00:07:00 level going on. You're not you're not you're not fucking fucking. What's his name? Billy
00:07:06 Madison in It's a Wonderful Life. Yeah, I more, moreover, it's just that I've sort of
00:07:14 changed my opinion on like the the concept of ending one's own life. Because I was thinking
00:07:22 about it like like a few weeks ago. And it was just sort of like, you know, the the the
00:07:28 benefits of staying alive outweighing the the, you know, the detriment of no longer being
00:07:35 able to be alive. And then it's just like, sometimes, like things pile up to a point
00:07:42 where I could see I could see a future where it's like suicide would not be that strange
00:07:48 of an option. Obviously, it's it's behooves me to do everything in my power to make sure
00:07:54 my life does not get to that point. But it's like, I wouldn't like the this that whole
00:08:02 thing where like, suicide is a coward's way out. Or like, or it's brave, like there's
00:08:09 a lot of discussion about whether or not like it's correct for a person to commit suicide.
00:08:16 And there was this there was this, this general feeling that I always had, which was I would
00:08:23 just be doing something bad for everyone who would be sad to see me gone. And I would be
00:08:31 not contributing anything to anyone. And in fact, taking away things from other people.
00:08:35 And so in that way, it's a selfish move. And, you know, you shouldn't even really think
00:08:42 about it. And on the one hand, on the one hand, that's still kind of true. Yeah. But
00:08:49 on the other, it's it's sort of a weird, like, if there's only one thing stopping you from
00:08:55 committing suicide, and it's based in guilt, I don't know whether that's good. I don't know
00:09:02 if that's good for your potential recovery, you know, if the only if I see what you mean,
00:09:07 like if the only reason that you're not going to do it is Oh, but it'd be wrong, though,
00:09:12 it's like, oh, you should have more reasons than that, hopefully. Yeah, I mean, I obviously
00:09:18 do have a lot more reasons than that. But like, that was the one thing I've changed on. Because
00:09:23 it's like I remember, yeah, you got to have you got to care about number one yourself.
00:09:33 And if the guilt of, you know, I don't know, it would be cringe to do it, you know, any
00:09:41 anything else, anything else in life, they say, you know, you got to do it. Maybe this
00:09:50 is like a malformed point, maybe this is stupid. But like, I feel like other things in life,
00:09:54 it's like you got to do it for yourself, you can't you can't do it for other people.
00:09:58 All right. So if you're just, yeah, if you're just continuing to live, because I guess everyone
00:10:04 else wants me to, you know, it's usually not that's not the optimal state. Yeah,
00:10:11 sure. Sure. But yeah, yeah, I understand, I understand, I understand what you're saying.
00:10:17 There was a time, there was a time in my life, I guess I was probably like 24 ish, I don't
00:10:25 know, something like that. And I was never like, I've never like seriously considered
00:10:32 killing myself, but I was pretty depressed for a while. And I do remember, and this is
00:10:36 kind of stupid in hindsight, I feel a little embarrassed about it. But at the time it seemed
00:10:40 reasonable. I was like, I'm sad. I'm sadder now than I was like maybe a year ago, I feel
00:10:47 worse. What if I just keep feeling even worse? What if the trajectory continues? And I was
00:10:52 like, boy, if I get like much, if this continues, like who knows at what point will it be like
00:10:57 well time to kill myself. So I called the suicide hotline. And I was like, hey, listen, I'm
00:11:04 not about to kill myself. I'm worried that like, there might come a time in the future
00:11:09 when I will though. And the girl on the phone like had she I mean, it was like a young
00:11:16 woman who was like, clearly just kind of reading from a script. She was not, she did
00:11:26 not have like robust a robust discussion in the can ready to go on the subject. She was
00:11:32 just like, you know, I don't remember the details. She was not ready to engage on this
00:11:41 on this thing like a suicide. Well, it's a suicide hotline. But like, I feel like suicide
00:11:45 hotline as a concept only really works for like, very young suicidal people who are just
00:11:52 in the midst of an emotional storm. And they need somebody to say it's okay. And they come
00:11:58 to it. Yeah, it is meant. I shouldn't have it was stupid. It's meant for like, if you're
00:12:04 like right about to do it, you call them in and hopefully like, you don't do it. It's
00:12:10 like, I got to talk myself out of this right now or something bad is going to happen. That's
00:12:15 what it's supposed to be for. Dur. It's funny. It's funny. You know, with the PCP, I'm just
00:12:24 imagining the PCP channel being in the state that it's in. And I guess we're probably not
00:12:28 going to release this episode just yet. We might not really we might delay the release,
00:12:32 but I'm just imagining the PCP channel in the state that it's in, and the fucking, and that this
00:12:39 episode goes up, but it's like suicide. It would be funny. An episode about why not kill yourself.
00:12:49 I mean, yeah, it's not this is not brought on by like the progress in this channel. It is brought
00:12:54 on by the consistent like stress of COVID and a lot of other smaller things going on. Yeah. And
00:13:05 as it just been like COVID has exacerbated all of the things that have made me feel bad in the
00:13:11 past, they've just become more powerful. It sucks. I don't really know how to deal with anything.
00:13:18 All right, here's a little rant I can go on. I was I was looking into online counseling because
00:13:25 like, I've never really bothered because I assume it's too expensive and I looked into it and yes,
00:13:30 it is too expensive. Fuck it. But I paid upfront for a thing. And then only after I paid upfront,
00:13:38 they said I would get four sessions. And then it would be a monthly payment. So once a week.
00:13:45 But the person they have assigned to me, their schedule is booked, was booked for the first
00:13:53 like two weeks after I pledged the money so that I have to I waited basically all June to get this
00:14:01 counseling session. It's going to happen tomorrow. But like, I've needed this counseling session for
00:14:08 two weeks. And it is it is just I have even wait, have you been paying without getting it?
00:14:15 I paid the lump sum for the month, which is supposed to be four sessions for the month.
00:14:21 And I've been waiting for two weeks until I get the first one. And so I really hope I really hope
00:14:28 that this this doesn't mean I don't like I have to pay again for the next month.
00:14:36 Was there like a number of sessions or like a number of like time? It was it was a number of
00:14:42 sessions. Okay, yeah, yeah. So like four sessions. And they said you are in charge of organizing and
00:14:49 I clicked on the person and they had apparently apparently you're not in charge of organizing
00:14:55 if they're like, Yeah, but you can't do it. Yeah. So it's like sucks. I I
00:15:01 I can't wait to see if that does anything because like I can't I feel like I can't speak just generally
00:15:11 like if I if I go if I you know, I've done multiple things in the past when I've had
00:15:16 like depressive episodes, I go and make a stupid video that sucks and people like,
00:15:20 Oh, don't worry about it. Or or whatever. And it's not there's nothing less helpful. And it's
00:15:26 and I sorry to anyone. I'm sure everyone's intentions are great when they do it. But
00:15:30 there's nothing less helpful than like when you make then when you like post online,
00:15:36 whether that's on Twitter or like YouTube about about like, I'm sad and people try and like
00:15:42 make you feel better, you know, like it just it sucks. It's not it's not the the fault. It's not
00:15:47 that they suck. It's that it's that the strategy of posting a terrible strategy sucks. Yeah. Yeah.
00:15:53 It can do something for you if you just want positive reaffirmation. But I think
00:15:59 too cynically of myself to like agree with any of that. It only really works when it's like a,
00:16:06 you know, a sincere, like friendly, like a person I'm very close to who talks about it in a sincere
00:16:14 way. If it's just people, yeah, it I'll read all the responses and some of them will be helpful
00:16:20 and some of them won't. And I'll usually fixate on the ones that aren't helpful. And or like
00:16:26 that just sort of, you know, don't read the comments. I read them. I'm stupid. I'm really
00:16:32 stupid. That's right. But you know, that's right. No, there is no, you know, I just am.
00:16:40 And it sucks. I want to just I pain for this therapy. Give me therapy. Give me those therapy
00:16:47 points. I've the only time the only time I've been I've had like a like, like, well, no,
00:16:56 that's not true. I guess I've done a little bit of it in the past. But most of my experience with
00:17:01 it was like, you know, my dad is a psychologist. And like, he never like, therapy'd me himself.
00:17:08 I feel like that would be weird. And you're probably not supposed to do that. Yeah. He but he
00:17:13 like, um, he got he got me therapy, but he always got it for me. Stop me if I've told talked about
00:17:20 this before, but he always got it for me when he wanted wanted it, like when he had a reason
00:17:28 to want me to be doing something else, not like when I asked him, like when I was in high school.
00:17:36 I don't remember what was going on, but they had like a period where I was
00:17:40 like kind of, uh, except I was like mad or something. I would know. No, I don't know if I
00:17:47 like, my grades weren't doing so well, or if I was like just being weird or just like my dad
00:17:52 didn't like how I was acting, he got me like a fucking sessions with some guy. And the guy prescribed
00:17:57 me, I think it was Ritalin or something. And I started taking it very briefly. And it sort of put
00:18:03 me like, emotionally, it like fucked up my emotions and I ended up like kicking a hole in the wall.
00:18:10 Which my dad, remember who had put me, who had, who had sought out a psychiatrist to give me medicine
00:18:17 because my dad wanted to change my behavior. It did change my behavior. I kicked a hole in the
00:18:22 wall. My dad was furious and punished me, made me repair the hole, maybe like buy, like like,
00:18:28 like repair the hole myself, made me like go out and buy like, you know, putty to like fill the
00:18:33 hole and stuff and like, you know, made me do this like long project of repairing it.
00:18:37 Which, to be fair, is a pretty fair punishment. If like, you know, you've made a hole in the
00:18:45 wall, you got to fix it. But I think I was grounded for a while too. Doesn't matter. And then there
00:18:50 was another, it was like, like when I was like in my early, my very early 20s, I think like right
00:18:55 out of college, my dad was like, why aren't you, why don't you have a job? Why aren't you pounding
00:18:59 the pavement? You know, because he's a fucking boomer, idiot. Happy Father's Day, everyone.
00:19:04 Oh, gonna be calling them later, later on today. I feel very good about the fact that I made like
00:19:11 a little card for him. And I gave it to him and it was funny and he laughed and I was like, okay,
00:19:16 cool. Epic. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. I'm gonna redo. We did, we did, we did a Mother's
00:19:24 Day call, which God, I can't, it feels like feels like only yesterday. Where does the time go that
00:19:29 it was Mother's Day? They're so close together. Why are they so fucking close together? We did
00:19:34 a Zoom call. Why is it that the boomers all use this teleconferencing software called Zoom?
00:19:42 Where did Zoom come from? I don't know. I can only guess on how it propagated, but I assume it's just
00:19:48 like, it's like everyone suddenly needs to communicate via voice calls, whereas they never
00:19:57 needed to before. And they're like, what do we use? And in a lot of workspaces, apparently people
00:20:04 are saying, oh, we use this Zoom thing. And so people's word of mouth has spread it everywhere.
00:20:09 And so everyone of that age bracket who has not heard of, I mean, most people know Skype, but
00:20:15 nobody uses Skype anymore. They sold Zoom as a better version of Skype. And they're like, well,
00:20:21 okay, let's get that. I'm just saying, why aren't the boomers on Discord? That's all I'm saying.
00:20:26 Because if they were, they would find out that what I say, they would see that I'm on Discord,
00:20:32 and they would say, hey, son. And I would like, oh, no. Oh, no.
00:20:35 I guess, I guess no joke. If the boomers were on Discord, people would stop using this. It would
00:20:40 become Facebook. Yeah. To a certain extent. Well, maybe, I don't know, maybe there could be,
00:20:46 you know, because, because. Imagine if your dad came into endless war.
00:20:50 If my, I'm imagining it, and it just doesn't track at all. It would be
00:21:02 it's a funny idea. But I think all that would really happen is he might
00:21:07 just make a couple of cringe posts and then never, never make a couple of just like me.
00:21:13 Like father likes son. Then he, then he'd do exhalation point thrash and then dab on you. Well,
00:21:20 dab on you like in a metaphorical sense. Oh, Christ. Munchy's my new son now.
00:21:26 Oh, no. Oof. Oh, man. The caffeine's, caffeine's hitting me all of a sudden. Oof. It's hitting me
00:21:32 hard. Oh boy. But yes, I would, I would be dabbed out of existence, perhaps, perhaps.
00:21:43 You know, you know what? You know what's really, even speaking of parents, you know,
00:21:46 it's really funny to me. It's, it's very funny to me that like Digi's mom likes a bunch of my
00:21:51 tweets these days. Digi's mom's really cool. Digi's mom seems pretty cool. Yeah. She's a big
00:21:58 Bernie bro. And she likes, she likes my like, she likes some of my, my more political tweets,
00:22:07 which is kind of funny. And I like that. I don't know. Just, that's just a funny fact about
00:22:15 reality. You know, when, when it comes to depression and stuff, the consistent, like,
00:22:26 a consistent way to stay depressed. Have you seen that CGP gray video, like 10 ways to maximize
00:22:31 depression? Is it the one about being on a boat? Yeah. But you're being on a boat,
00:22:36 how to make yourself as depressed as possible. So as, to, as an instructional guide for people
00:22:42 who are depressed, to just do the opposite of this and you will be, you'll be on the path to
00:22:46 being better. It's, yeah, yeah. It's like, it's like, here are some things that you are probably
00:22:51 doing. Yeah. And so I'm like, all right, I feel bad right now. And talking, talking about it,
00:23:00 thinking about, thinking about is the worst. That just perpetuates things. Like, I'm just,
00:23:05 I think about it too much. And then I have an outburst on Twitter, not specifically at anyone.
00:23:10 I just like say, oh, I'm so sad, guys, in so many words. I had a thing. I had a thing. I made a
00:23:17 tweet. I succumbed to the urge the other day and I made a tweet. What did I say? Like a pissed off
00:23:23 and feeling bad. That was my, that was my indulgence. And it's sad. And it's like, oh, God, I did it.
00:23:29 I made an I'm sad post. Boo. Boo. Stop posting. Stop posting. But like, I was thinking today,
00:23:38 all right, I've got to, I've got to like work with myself. I am two people. I am me, the guy who
00:23:48 wants to stop being depressed and me, the idiot who is depressed. I need to try and coax myself out
00:23:54 of this. There's two wolves inside you. Yeah. And they're both going, oh. Yeah. They're both fucking
00:24:01 bass. One is bass and one is cringe. Which one do you feed is the question? Yeah.
00:24:09 Yeah. But I need to like, get myself busy with something. And I have no, the thing that, oh,
00:24:19 no, here we go again, Gibbs talking about art problems. But sucker sucker. There's the Gibbs
00:24:26 stupid idiot corner. Can we have a jingle? Eleazar, quick, write a jingle for Gibbs stupid
00:24:33 idiot corner. This is the stupid idiot corner. Hi, stupid idiot. All right. So I'm a stupid idiot.
00:24:47 And I've been talking, I talked last time about how like, there's a difference between working on
00:24:52 something which is mindless and you're just following orders and creation, creativity.
00:25:00 Right now I'm depressed for various reasons. And going to work is difficult because it requires
00:25:10 a lot of thinking. Do you physically go to work? No. I mean, at my desk, you know. Right. Yeah. Oh,
00:25:19 yeah. Okay. Like drawing. So like, but creation, creativity is all very thoughtful. I need to
00:25:27 think about a lot of things. But if I'm, if I'm allowing myself to think too much, I'm easily
00:25:33 slipping into how all of the depression thinking I've been having that distracts me. And it's like,
00:25:38 all right, I need to busy myself with some like hard labor, some stuff, some meaningless tasks
00:25:45 that I can just say to someone, tell me what to do, sir. And they will say, okay. And so
00:25:54 I'm going to, I'm going to like be a good boy and just ask my parents for if they need help,
00:26:02 if they need me to do something around the house, ask my brothers if they need help.
00:26:06 I'm just going to do that for a few days. I'm going to see if me being a workhorse will
00:26:10 figure out like, just get me out of this, whatever it is. Because like at the end of the day, there's
00:26:16 no one but me that is the guy who can get me out of whatever I'm in. And I need to find the easiest
00:26:21 way to stop myself from lounging around thinking about how everything sucks.
00:26:27 Interesting. Interesting.
00:26:30 Selfless volunteer tasks. That's my new plan.
00:26:35 I mean, you could, I mean, if that doesn't work, I mean, you could like volunteer for
00:26:44 like an org or something. I don't know if you just, yeah, that would probably be the next,
00:26:49 the next step. The next step. I mean, the reason I haven't gone immediately to that is because
00:26:53 I don't know what's open. I don't know whether you can go anywhere and do things right now.
00:26:58 Sure, there probably are. I could look into it. I don't know either, but I'm sure there's probably
00:27:03 something, but like, yeah, okay. Yeah, but my brother has like a leg issue, so he needs help at
00:27:09 the moment. He's been like walking around with a cane. Oof, yeah, sucks. Him and Tom, I guess.
00:27:17 Yeah, he's, I don't know whether I mentioned it, but I don't know if you mentioned it in the chat,
00:27:23 I think. I don't know if you've mentioned it on the show. So one of my brothers,
00:27:28 how long has that been going on? Can we say names? Can I say who it is?
00:27:33 I don't think it matters, but we won't say names, just because.
00:27:38 Oh, sorry, should I cut that? Ellie's are cut that. Cut that, Ellie's are.
00:27:42 Okay, cut out the part right. I mean, they know who my brother's are. Not even that.
00:27:48 Okay, fine, whatever. Leg problem. Basically, the point is leg problem, which cannot be seen by
00:27:54 doctors because doctors are so busy with COVID. Yeah, really? They're that busy?
00:28:01 Well, I mean, he's tried to get an appointment so many times, and it is just like delay after
00:28:07 delay. It's gotten worse, and it's like he's really feeling like. That bad, huh? Yeah, I mean,
00:28:14 it's not like, I don't know exactly what the problem is, but he can't walk very well, it hurts a lot.
00:28:19 He's trying to get medication for it, but that is like, it really sucks, and I need,
00:28:26 if there's a person who needs help right now, it's him, just with physical things,
00:28:30 moving stuff around. I need to get myself busy, and that is a good excuse to do it.
00:28:37 It's not the same for a couple of reasons, because one, it's not like actively hindering me from
00:28:43 doing anything, and two, I haven't really tried. It's not that I have not been able to pursue it,
00:28:47 it's that I haven't really tried to pursue it because of COVID, but I really need a dentist
00:28:53 appointment, because I have a couple of things. My teeth are not green, but I have,
00:29:02 this feels like oversharing, but whatever, who gives a fuck? I have one cavity that I can see.
00:29:10 It's minor, but I know where it is, and if I look at it, I can see it, and it's very
00:29:15 distressing for me. Whenever I think about it, it doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt or anything,
00:29:20 but it's like, that looks weird, and there's also, I've talked about it, there's a,
00:29:27 I had a bike accident when I was a kid, a teenager, and I broke my two front teeth, and I had them
00:29:33 partially replaced with false tooth material, and this has been the case for a while, but I think
00:29:39 it's gotten worse. There's like a stain on the part between, there's like kind of an ugly line
00:29:47 that has a visible line that has appeared between like the fake part of my tooth and the real part,
00:29:53 and it's, I hate it, I hate it. So, oh, and then of course, there's the fact that I broke it
00:29:58 when I was biting into the poster. I broke the fault, I broke a piece off of the fake part of my
00:30:04 tooth when I bit the poster at Rat, not Radcon, RFC Kong K, RFC Readyfuckers con killer, whatever
00:30:13 it was called, on the Endless War lecture, which is gone now, but that's fine. And,
00:30:20 You didn't upload that to the Endless War YouTube channel?
00:30:26 No. Wow. I mean, okay, I think I have a backup file, but like, so I don't think
00:30:34 God, I hope, I'm sure, I'm, we must have, I'm, I'm almost positive, somebody's got a backup,
00:30:41 maybe I do, or no, it must be Munchy or Ethan. Oh God, there's no way, there's no way Ethan would
00:30:46 have, they would have deleted it. It has to still exist. It has to, I believe that it does, but you
00:30:50 know, it's, it's not on, right now, and it's lost all its views and all that. Okay, that's a tangent,
00:30:56 but like, you know, so I have a chip out of my tooth. It's not very visible, and I can't,
00:31:00 don't even really notice it anymore, but it is there. So, so that's, that's three good reasons
00:31:05 why I really need to see a dentist soon. But I, I don't want to go, I don't, I was like, no,
00:31:10 wait till the pandemic's over, but like, God, what if the pandemic lasts like another year,
00:31:14 you know? Like, what if this cavity gets really, gets worse, like I, it starts to hurt or something?
00:31:19 What if, what if I need a fucking root canal because I wait that long? I don't know.
00:31:23 I haven't been paying too much attention to the recent COVID statistics like I was when it started.
00:31:29 So I don't know whether it's in any way slowing down anywhere.
00:31:34 In, in, in Massachusetts, it has slowed down. It's actually pretty good. The stats are pretty
00:31:40 promising in Massachusetts. Actually, I haven't checked for a few days. Let me see if there's
00:31:47 been any reversal. COVID cases in Massachusetts. Yeah, no, since, since the middle of April,
00:31:57 in the middle of April, we were getting like over a thousand new cases, like between one and
00:32:01 2000 new cases a day, it has dropped off to like, like maybe two, one to 300 a day. And it's just
00:32:09 kind of there. It doesn't, it doesn't seem to be spiking again. So that's pretty cool, I guess.
00:32:15 Pretty cool, man. So that's how, yeah. I guess I should feel good about that.
00:32:21 What were we talking about? What were we saying?
00:32:24 You were saying dentist.
00:32:25 Oh yeah. I guess I should, maybe it's coming on time where I need to be like, okay,
00:32:34 the risk is managed now. You just go out, wear a mask, go to the fucking dentist.
00:32:40 You may as well if you can.
00:32:43 Yeah. I guess I should start looking into that Lamal.
00:32:46 Because I've been, I mean, when people was first talking about the how long COVID is going to
00:32:52 last, they said that some people were like doom and gloom and saying, oh, this will be a thing
00:32:58 forever now. It's like, don't say that, don't think that, don't be that, but maybe it's true.
00:33:03 Maybe it will just have a like, it'll slow down in the summer and then come back in the winter,
00:33:09 hardcore, and then it will stay for quite a while into the next year.
00:33:14 There are states where it is having a second wind, shitty states where they didn't take
00:33:22 social distancing seriously, weren't that strict about it, culturally didn't value wearing a mask
00:33:29 and whatever the fuck, thought it was communist or whatever. Some of those states are seeing
00:33:34 like a second spike, which I, you know, great. But we're not so, you know, cool. Good for us.
00:33:44 I like Massachusetts a lot. I'm proud of us. I hate everyone else. I hate all the other states.
00:33:51 They suck ass. That's it. That's all I gotta say. That's my useful commentary on America is,
00:33:57 hey guys, Massachusetts is good guys. Everyone else is the bad guys, the end.
00:34:04 What were we talking about? Dentistry sucks. I hate the dentist. I have become,
00:34:10 I have become an extremely fearful, cowardly person. I'm terrified of everything.
00:34:19 Yeah. Well, I say become. I definitely didn't use to be this bad. I didn't use to be this
00:34:27 afraid of planes or the dentist or death in general or any anything. Now I am like,
00:34:39 I was thinking about, thinking about the dentist. I'm like, that's so fucking scary. I'm terrified.
00:34:45 I was thinking about thinking about like, we're at a father's day again, because I think my dad
00:34:51 wants us at some point to go on like a, see as a sailboat, he wants us all to go out on the boat.
00:34:57 And I was thinking about that last night. And I was like, that's, I don't want to do that.
00:35:01 That's scary. What if we drown? It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, I'm scared. I'm scared to do
00:35:08 that. I think I'll die if we do that. What do you think this is like a new thing? Why do you think
00:35:14 you've become more scared of things? I don't know. I mean, I think, I guess I have a couple
00:35:24 hypotheses and they could all be true to a certain extent. One is that the pandemic has made me more
00:35:30 conscious of, of, of death and stuff, of bad things happening. Two, it might just be because I'm
00:35:38 older and like think about, think things through more thoroughly and the logical consequence of
00:35:45 almost anything could be like, yeah, but what if I die and that's bad? I mean, I don't know whether
00:35:51 that's thinking things through so much as overthinking things. Is it overthinking things?
00:35:58 I mean, that's all that matters. That's all that matters. All that matters in the end is that I
00:36:02 don't die. And what if I die doing anything? Yeah, I mean, I think that sure would be a mistake.
00:36:10 A lot of people know that things can be dangerous, but like they weigh the options and they decide that
00:36:18 most like statistically speaking, there's not much of a risk. So they're not going to worry
00:36:25 about it. I mean, I know that like it's so unlikely for you to die in a plane crash,
00:36:34 but I was so scared on the flight. I mean, on the flight to Radcon and especially on the flight home
00:36:41 from Radcon. I mean, the flight home was that was fucked me. I was off to like COVID had started
00:36:47 spreading. I was like, oh, shit. I wasn't scared of the pain. I mean, I was scared of the pandemic,
00:36:52 but that's not what I was like thinking about in the in the in the seat. I'm thinking, what if we
00:36:58 crash? Which is like, it's almost guaranteed not to happen. That's like as close to guaranteed
00:37:05 not to happen as almost anything in life. You know, to me, this says with my armchair psychology to
00:37:12 you know, tints glasses, twists glasses, I don't know what I was going about to say there.
00:37:19 I'm imagining you like gendo gendo aricato pushing your fuck. That's the guy from Eva,
00:37:24 right? The dad pushing your fucking glasses up with your middle finger or whatever.
00:37:28 Well, that's that's the stampede that does that. Never mind, whatever.
00:37:32 What this is to me is that you for some reason care about your own life more, like you have some
00:37:41 like these all these things have always been like, like if you were suicidal, for example,
00:37:48 and you're on a plane, you'd be like, man, the plane could crash if only, you know,
00:37:54 that would be a comforting feeling if you wanted to die. But because because you you want to live
00:37:59 so much. Yes, that it's extremely scary, the idea that you could die. Yeah. No, you're absolutely
00:38:08 right. I want to live so bad. I want to live forever. Why do you want to live? What's what's
00:38:14 being alive so fucking based being alive is so fucking based. It's not it's nothing. It's not
00:38:19 I'm just here. I'm just here in my fucking room. You know, it's COVID, man. It's quarantine.
00:38:26 And that that sucks compared to like it not being like that. But it's so good compared to
00:38:34 being dead. I'll take anything. I'll fucking I'll fucking live in a fucking in like a room.
00:38:40 I'll fucking live through the the drudgery of like the day to day,
00:38:43 every day the same, nothing happens. I don't care. I'll take it. Yes, please.
00:38:49 Experiencing anything whatsoever. Based. Thank you, sir. More please. I'll take all you got.
00:39:00 I don't know, man. That's I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand the mindset
00:39:07 of like, uh, sorry, I'm not trying to single you out. This is not about you. This is about
00:39:13 any any time any time I hear someone like thinking about life is life is shit. Life life share life
00:39:21 share is suboptimal. Is it even worth it? I I that's I'm never I never I never think that I am.
00:39:30 I'm definitely coming at it from a very extreme pessimistic point of view. Like I think of the
00:39:35 things that life could give me in the future. And I'm like, yeah, well, it's not going to happen.
00:39:39 All those things are not going to happen. I'm just going to be sad from now until then may as
00:39:43 well end it quickly. That's just the the mindset I get in when I'm in the worst spaces. The the
00:39:49 thing that makes me the saddest is thinking about how I'll be dead one day. So like, you know,
00:39:56 the the answer to that is clearly not like, oh, might as well just actually once in a while it
00:40:01 does good boy, since it's going to happen anyway, might as well just get it over with now. I mean,
00:40:07 but like I never seriously entertain that thought, because it's like, well, that doesn't make any
00:40:11 fucking sense. It does cross my mind occasionally, if only by by happenstance by chance. I was I was
00:40:21 going to say something else. I was going to say something else about that. What did you just say?
00:40:28 What was the last point you just made there? When I'm in the the the worst of the worst feelings
00:40:35 that the extreme pessimism says the only time I was thinking like maybe it'd be better to be dead
00:40:40 was when I was having was when I was in the throes of my fucking kidney stone episodes
00:40:47 like earlier this year or last year. How long I don't even remember how long ago that I feel
00:40:51 like that was last year. That was it was last year. It was more than a year ago. That's right.
00:40:54 And like, you know, that, you know, is considered considered by many to be one of the most painful
00:41:01 experiences a human being can undergo akin to, you know, childbirth, say, and it was so bad then
00:41:09 that I there were times and I was like, maybe maybe death, maybe death would be better than this.
00:41:15 That was the that's what it took to get me to really think like is life worth living?
00:41:25 So that's, I think, I think that's what it's so but like, you know, I feel I feel so upset
00:41:30 thinking about mortality that it paralyzes me and it ruins it kind of ruins my life
00:41:37 in a way that it that it upsets me so much. I feel like I feel like I'm just whining now.
00:41:44 Ah, well, we're all whiners rule. Yeah, we're all we're all just
00:41:52 trying to deal with a really bad time. Yeah. Well, that's the thing I was thinking of like,
00:42:00 COVID is not like directly affected me. It has made me scared to like go outside.
00:42:08 Just generally, but aside from that, because I don't go out that much anyway. So it's like,
00:42:13 it hasn't truly personally affected me that much. And I wonder if some part of the pandemic,
00:42:19 quote unquote, as a as an idea is just sort of me having some sort of excuse to feel like shit.
00:42:27 Yeah. Yeah, because like, it's really it's like, I don't know.
00:42:35 Yeah, I can't imagine that I'm correct on on what I think ever.
00:42:42 What do you mean? Oh, just anything? Yeah, you just doubt yourself all the time.
00:42:47 I don't I don't I don't trust myself. I think I know what I'm doing. And then I'm like, oh, yeah.
00:42:55 Oh, okay.
00:43:01 Welcome to the procrastiners podcast. That was the pre show.
00:43:05 That's the pre show. Now we're going to be like funny, goofy, funny people that are having fun.
00:43:12 No. Do you do you want to move on from this topic?
00:43:19 I mean, if you've got nothing else to say about it, yeah.
00:43:23 Nothing in particular. I feel like I've feel like I've thoroughly covered everything.
00:43:31 I guess I do want to talk about like the state of the channel.
00:43:36 Last time, I don't know how much I have to say about this might as well touch on it.
00:43:40 Last time, I think we did talk about how, you know, oh, the channel's been terminated.
00:43:45 That sucks. Maybe it'll be back and then now it's back. But like it's videos are still missing.
00:43:51 Let's I like I said, in my announcement video, you know, it's you might as well reiterate that
00:43:59 because I don't know if yeah, probably a lot of people didn't click on it. And I
00:44:04 I yeah, like we because because we record these so far ahead of when they released, it's like
00:44:11 if you if you had just if you had if you just heard the episode, you wouldn't really understand
00:44:15 what's going on with it. And and who knows, maybe by the time this one comes out,
00:44:19 there the situation will have progressed in some new fashion and who fucking knows what that could
00:44:24 be. But like, okay, the a bunch of the latest content is gone. That's the gist of it, including
00:44:32 almost all basically all the rad content, except for that one stream, I don't know. But like,
00:44:37 when when we got the news that channel was terminated for quote unquote, like,
00:44:42 encouraging illegal activities, or violating term or encouraging people to violate terms of
00:44:48 service or something like that. My first thought, and I think a bunch of people's first thought
00:44:53 was that it was the the Black Lives Matter charity stream, which I had insisted on doing.
00:44:59 And graciously, a few people who were on board with were wanted wanted to see happen and everyone
00:45:09 else didn't seem interested. But whatever. My first thought was, oh, that's it. Oh, because
00:45:17 we're because I said fuck the police a cab like though that's encouraging.
00:45:22 Political violence or whatever. I don't I don't think so anymore. And the reason I don't think
00:45:28 that's it is because of the weird fact that all all the videos that were struck it is
00:45:35 for terms of service violations. Like I think because all these videos were struck and removed
00:45:40 for terms of service violations, I think that it must be the videos were struck and that triggered
00:45:45 an automated response from YouTube to terminate the channel. And the fact that all it is explicitly
00:45:53 all the videos from when the hack occurred onward, it's those videos. So it must have
00:46:00 something to do with the hack. That's too big a coincidence, right? Do you think so?
00:46:05 Yeah, I feel like that's pretty, pretty easy to together that something about like,
00:46:13 I don't know, a very delayed reaction from YouTube to like, oh, this hack has been announced,
00:46:18 you know, the team YouTube Twitter people, they dealt with it, but then
00:46:22 the initial flag was maybe still in the system and has only just now got around to
00:46:27 implementing itself. It goes to that date and it says, oh, wrong, wrong, wrong, get rid of,
00:46:32 and then deletes the channel, you know, without without, you know, just a robot looking at it.
00:46:39 Yeah. Well, the stated reason given being like encouraging illegal or terms of service violations
00:46:45 is like weird and doesn't really fit that idea. And I don't know why it would be like that.
00:46:49 Well, if you think of it being like the Brad stuff, like would that have been
00:46:53 well, the Brad stuff was just advertising fucking cryptocurrency, right?
00:46:58 Oh, yeah, I guess, I guess that's not technically illegal in any way.
00:47:02 I mean, I don't think so. But who knows, since it's an automated response to who fucking knows.
00:47:09 Yeah, still no no actual knowledge about what is what is the reason.
00:47:13 No, not really. Okay. Well, so yeah, that's that's what I mean. I mentioned it just because
00:47:23 people are I see comments on like the announcement video saying like, you know, people one of them
00:47:30 one of the more common, you know, probably the most common theory is Brad, which yeah,
00:47:35 I think it's probably Brad. Second, second most common is probably Oh, it was the Black Lives
00:47:41 Matter ACAB thing, which was my initial thought too, but I've changed my mind. Then it's like,
00:47:45 Oh, it was because what about the what times you smoked weed? What about that time you encouraged
00:47:51 someone said you encourage shop? I don't remember encouraging shoplift. Maybe I did. I probably
00:47:55 did. I feel like that was a thing like looting is cool in the Black Lives Matter stream.
00:48:03 Like it's looting is cool if it's against target or something was definitely said.
00:48:07 Somebody said shoplifting, which shoplifting is not looting. I don't know. I feel like they were
00:48:12 talking about something else, but it doesn't matter because I don't think that's the reason.
00:48:17 I don't know. I guess. I mean, what do you think? Do you think the videos are going to come back?
00:48:25 I feel like eventually. I mean, they were responding to you weren't they about like you
00:48:32 gave them a list through the PCP account on Twitter of all the videos and they said,
00:48:37 Okay, we've got the videos now we'll get to work or something. I actually okay. I actually
00:48:42 fucked up a little not not very much, but yeah, they responded through Twitter. I did give them
00:48:48 the list the list. Okay, I actually I don't know if this is a good idea or not. I felt like I had
00:48:54 to make a split decision in the moment. I told them this is all of them I might have missed some
00:48:59 and I deliberately left out the ones with weed in them. So so maybe I shouldn't have done that,
00:49:08 but that's what I did because I felt like desperate and I was like, I don't want to do anything risky
00:49:14 at all here. So I didn't include like the two streams that are the two videos that the dude
00:49:21 weed them out or whatever, but I told them like this is not all of them. But then accidentally,
00:49:26 I forgot because I had looked at the the live stream lists because there's two on your YouTube
00:49:32 studio, you can see your uploads and you can see your live streams and I had looked at the uploads
00:49:38 and okay, for some reason on the uploaded videos, the deleted videos are listed as the most recent,
00:49:44 but on the live videos, the removed videos are listed as like not recent, they're listed at the
00:49:51 at the end of the chronological list instead of the beginning and I didn't realize that at the time.
00:49:54 So I thought that the ones on the stream were just gone. So I told them these are the uploaded
00:49:59 videos, the streams are simply gone. It turns out they're not gone, they are there. So I went back
00:50:04 and I replied again like a day later to that thread on Twitter and I said, hey, I found the
00:50:10 more URLs here are the streams and I gave them the and I gave them the streams and again,
00:50:16 perhaps out of cowardice or whatever, I didn't include the the BLM stream, but I told them I
00:50:22 don't think this is all of them. And like, logically, I don't see why I should have to give them every
00:50:27 single URL for every there's like 50 or more videos, right, that are gone, maybe even more,
00:50:33 maybe there's like 70, I don't even remember, there's a lot, but I gave them at least most of them,
00:50:38 almost all of them. I don't see why I should have to feel like they should be able to just look at
00:50:44 our fucking channel and see our videos, see which ones are deleted, and be like, oh yeah, these are
00:50:50 wrong. I don't know. But that's what I did. And they did respond to it. But no action has been
00:50:57 taken this far. And honestly, what what I'm afraid of is not that they will is not that they do it's
00:51:07 not that they do not intend to restore the videos, it's that there will be something about the process
00:51:14 of removal that like, they will take too long, and they will like, maybe they have the videos
00:51:21 stored in some like secondary form right now, and that will like, the timer will run out and they
00:51:27 will be like, they will hit some sort of hard limit where it's like our auto remove videos
00:51:33 are no longer even stored secondarily, they are gone forever. I don't know if that's the case.
00:51:38 Why would you assume such a system? I'm not assuming such a system, but I don't know that
00:51:44 that isn't the case. Right, but I don't know how I wouldn't even have considered the idea that
00:51:51 there's a time limit. I mean, YouTube has taken a long time to bring back a channel before.
00:51:57 And when it does eventually happen, it just happens. It's all back.
00:52:02 I feel like, okay, I have I have mixed feelings about this. Sometimes it feels
00:52:10 and like, you're not so much a culprit in this, but sometimes it feels like I am the most
00:52:21 worried about this. And everyone else to varying degrees is not taking this seriously,
00:52:27 not present in when I like discuss it in the channel or something. And sometimes I feel like,
00:52:35 what is everyone else doing? Like, why is that? Why don't they care? But then sometimes I
00:52:43 consider and I'm like, is this just an extension of my semi new tendency to be afraid of everything?
00:52:52 Is this just me being paranoid about yet yet another thing?
00:52:57 I think it is.
00:52:58 Is this just an extension of my, oh, but what if I die though to like, oh, but what if the channel
00:53:03 dies though? What if the what if the I mean, I think it's I think it's fair to be like,
00:53:10 you know, paying a close attention to it and doing stuff. But I think the rest of the guys,
00:53:16 then it's not like they don't care. It's that they assume with enough time, it'll come back
00:53:22 because we've already sent the tickets and there's nothing else to do but wait. And, you know,
00:53:28 like, like, I don't think people don't give a shit. I think they just aren't like freaking out
00:53:33 about it like you are. Yeah, I am freaking out about it. I'm very upset. I've been very upset
00:53:42 constantly. I don't know what's it been like a week now, more than a week now because the channel
00:53:49 was terminated before the last time you recorded was a terminated on like a week before Friday or
00:53:55 something. I don't know. I don't know. But, you know, that that's a worry. It's just very nerve
00:54:07 racking because I don't know. I don't know how it works. I feel like the success rate of YouTube,
00:54:15 you know, saving, you know, erroneously destroyed content is not 100%.
00:54:27 And who knows? Who knows if Radcon 4 could just become a statistic at any moment,
00:54:34 just like me, you know? Things are so fragile, so subject to fucking cruel fate.
00:54:42 I mean, yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Strangely, I don't feel as pessimistic about the YouTube channel
00:54:56 as I do about life itself. I see. Fair. It's, it's, I expected to come back,
00:55:07 all the videos to come back. I maybe a one or two will be like,
00:55:12 actually, this one is the bad one. So this is the reason and we're not giving you back this one.
00:55:16 And we'll be like, ah, fine. They already, they copyright struck and removed the end of YouTube
00:55:23 episode for the the Ava footage that I used in that one. So not an illegal activity, not the
00:55:29 stated reason for the deletion of the channel, just like a knock on effect of, oh, in addition to
00:55:35 wrong, like as we review the case of your channel that we deleted for no reason,
00:55:40 we found some other shit that we want to inflict upon you. Ha ha, gone dead. Cool.
00:55:49 When's things going to be fucking happy? When's things going to be fucking based again?
00:55:55 How does one escape into the virtual realm anymore when the virtual realm is just as bad as the real
00:56:00 realm? Yep. It sure is. Twitter sucks. Everything going on in the world sucks. And Twitter, I don't
00:56:14 know, just shows me that. And it's, it's a bummer. I guess, I guess the one thing that I got to say
00:56:23 that is good, in spite of everything else, I have started working on slime and punishment again,
00:56:30 like in earnest, like I've made actual progress on the finale, which is cool. I put that off for a
00:56:35 long time, couldn't bring myself to look at that for a while, but now I have. And it's good. It's
00:56:40 going pretty good. It's not, it's not that bad. It's going to be fine. And that'll be, and I'll feel
00:56:46 better. I'll feel better about life in general once that's done, I think. So that's how I'm,
00:56:53 that's my strategy for improving my own lot in life is that that's the thing that I think will,
00:56:59 you know, improve how I feel is getting that done. So I'm getting it done. And it's going to
00:57:05 be pretty cool. I think that what I've got done on it looks pretty cool. And I think it'll sound
00:57:10 pretty cool too. Sixten is going to be, he's, I think, I think he's, he's going to make a track for
00:57:15 it and it's going to be pretty sick because he does really good shit. I don't know, man. What else
00:57:28 you want to talk about? Oh, the itch.io games. Oh, the bundle a little bit about that. There's a
00:57:35 big old bundle with like 1500 itch.io games. I think it's at least over now, right? I think
00:57:44 they've stopped selling it. Yeah. So, but I've been going through those, you know, every so often
00:57:50 I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I sit, I stare out the window and I turn
00:57:54 around to my computer and I hunch over on my back, my hunchback back and I click download on some
00:58:00 random one of these games and I play it and I'm like, Hey, you know what? Things are okay.
00:58:06 Right. I've really gotten into this trilogy of point and click adventures called forever lost
00:58:15 which is it's like a computer generated 90s looking CG
00:58:22 backgrounds and you click around on things, you know, there's a drawer, you open the drawer,
00:58:27 there's a strange puzzle piece and you've got to find where the puzzle piece fits in another room.
00:58:32 There's lots of out of the box thinking puzzles and it's really, it's really good for that,
00:58:40 for that sort of thing. They got this great game mechanic where you can take a picture
00:58:47 of a clue or a thing so that you can take it with you and reference it later when you think
00:58:55 you need it and it's like these games often they have clues that are just given to you as clues
00:59:03 like you click on a thing and it's like, oh, I jot that down in my notebook and that is giving
00:59:09 you too much information sometimes. Like sometimes you need to, it's really good because you are
00:59:19 tasked with the taking of the picture yourself. The pictures don't need to be taken, they're just
00:59:24 for your own reference but by having that automaty, automony, how do you say?
00:59:31 Automonicity.
00:59:37 Autonomy. To take the picture, when you think you have found something that can be a clue
00:59:46 in another area, it sort of makes it so that you're figuring out everything and there's no,
00:59:53 there's like tiny bits of story here and there but there's no characters, it's just like,
00:59:59 find your way out of this creepy strange place with these elaborate puzzles that couldn't possibly
01:00:04 exist in real life except they kind of could but nobody would build them but forever lost,
01:00:12 there's three parts. Right, cool. I haven't played, have you played a lot of the games
01:00:21 from the bundle or? I've gone around and I've played, I don't know, like 30 or something.
01:00:28 It's more than me. I've played maybe, I've tried out maybe like six or seven, I don't know.
01:00:33 There's so many of them that are like tabletop booklets and pixel art asset packs and things.
01:00:42 There's a lot of things that are not video games. Yeah, I don't mind that though because
01:00:47 occasionally it's like a Photoshop brush pack, like pixelated something or other and it's like,
01:00:51 oh cool, I'll just add that to my things. Yeah, nothing wrong with it.
01:00:57 Interesting cool fonts. I usually don't like having to pay for fonts so having it for quote
01:01:04 unquote free is pretty cool. It would be funny if there came a sort of almost a baby boom,
01:01:14 if you will, of indie games in the next year or so that all had maybe a lot of the same assets
01:01:22 in them and it was like because a lot of people bought this bundle and like a lot of the packs
01:01:27 got used by like first time devs or whatever. That would be pretty funny. I don't know if that'll
01:01:33 happen. I don't know if it's that if it was that big of a cultural event. It was a bit of a cultural
01:01:37 event, I think, this fucking bundle. I played this one game. There were so many fucking games on the
01:01:44 list that I had no idea so I just googled like best games on the racial justice bundle or whatever
01:01:51 and I found a couple of like articles counting down what they thought were some good ones.
01:01:54 I played this one called the stillness of the wind which is like a, you seen this one?
01:02:02 Oh no, his microphone's muted. Sorry, it's just a thing. Actually, wait, I've got a thing too.
01:02:09 I just got a package. My roommate was just like, hey package for you. I'm going to open it on the
01:02:13 podcast. All right, I'll just take a quick break to piss and then I'll be back. Oh, shit. Oh, okay,
01:02:21 all right. If you must, if you must. All right, so viewers, this package is some more ingredients
01:02:31 that I have gotten for my gummy worm making. I'm trying to branch out into alternative
01:02:38 ingredients in order to achieve the broadest possible range of consistencies because different
01:02:43 different kinds of gummies have different consistencies to them and I'm trying to,
01:02:48 like the ones I've been making are pretty decent. They have a kind of a fairly similar consistency
01:02:54 to like a traditional gummy bear but that's actually not my favorite kind. I actually like the chewier
01:03:00 ones better. So I have, okay, I have another bag of erythritol which is an artificial sweetener
01:03:07 which is very good. That's fine but I've already been using that. I've got rice, rice flour.
01:03:16 Rice flour I think is a good, I mean it's not keto but you know, you only use a little bit and I
01:03:21 think it's fine. Rice flour I think will be good to give a nice sort of mochi like stickiness
01:03:30 or thickness to something. I'm actually very excited about experimenting with that.
01:03:37 And this stuff called inulin which is, it can be derived from various things. I thought it came
01:03:46 from, what was it, chicory root but this is apparently from Jerusalem artichokes. I don't
01:03:56 even know what that is but inulin, based on what I know about it, I think it's similar to the main
01:04:02 ingredient that I've been using which is soluble fiber from tapioca. I think inulin is just soluble
01:04:10 fiber, oh from, from another source. Okay the stuff I've been using is isomolto oligosaccharide.
01:04:18 This inulin is apparently fructo oligosaccharide so I think it's similar but it might have, it might,
01:04:24 I don't know how it's different but it is different so I'll be, I'll be fucking around with that.
01:04:29 Probably later today I'll be fucking cooking up another batch and seeing what,
01:04:33 this is very exciting. It's very exciting because the recipe I've been using has gotten a little
01:04:37 stale. They're a little samey, I've sort of gotten bored of the same consistency. I'm glad to have
01:04:41 new ingredients, new ingredients to fuck around with and see what happens. Ah boy oh fucking boy.
01:04:47 Right. Did you hear, did you hear any of that? I did, I was listening to most of it. Okay sick.
01:04:53 Um I've got more, I've got more shit on the way. The thing I'm most excited about is pectin.
01:05:01 Pectin is a normal, is it like a perfectly normal ingredient that normal recipes call for?
01:05:07 I thought and yet it's very hard, very difficult to find on like Amazon like almost every,
01:05:15 almost every like thing I could buy that was called pectin on Amazon was not pectin. It was
01:05:23 a combination of like pectin, dextrose and citric acid which I don't want because that's not keto
01:05:30 but that's like overwhelmingly that's the form you can buy it in which I guess most recipes that you
01:05:36 would use it in like it's traditionally used in like jelly and like most recipes would call for
01:05:42 those things um but I don't want that. That's not what I'm looking for. I want the pure, I want the
01:05:47 pure shit. I've got my own citric acid, I've got my own acids, I've got my own fucking sweeteners,
01:05:53 thank you very much. No need, no need. Um anyway the uh yeah the stillness of the wind is about
01:06:03 being an old woman on a farm and getting letters from your family and I don't know having nightmares
01:06:13 cool. It's very, it's pretty good. I like a lot of the weird like non-tradition, not
01:06:23 unusual concepts that these itchio games go with. Yeah stillness of the wind is like you're on a farm
01:06:30 so it sort of feels like a farming game um because like you know you can, you milk your goats,
01:06:36 you make cheese out of the goat milk, you like pick mushrooms, you collect eggs from your fucking
01:06:45 chicken coop, you have to cook, you have to cook food and eat it so you don't get exhausted uh or
01:06:51 whatever um but I'm pretty sure that other than eating I'm not sure you can actually lose like um
01:07:01 I kind of think the farming is it like that like it's not like uh like that's not really what it's
01:07:07 about it's just kind of there to add like texture to the experience of being this woman and getting
01:07:12 these letters um but I'm pretty I'm pretty sure that you can't actually like fail uh I but you
01:07:20 could probably like you could probably arrive at a point where like your farm sucks sooner and maybe
01:07:28 that would change your experience a little bit uh but uh yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't know it was a
01:07:35 very sad game oh this looks cool it was it was a big it was a bummer I like I like this sort of um
01:07:41 sunsetty orange glow it looks it reminds me maybe it's just the way she's dressed but it
01:07:48 reminds me of journey a little bit yeah um it kind of looks like that it's got that sort of minimal
01:07:55 minimalist realists aesthetic I guess it's like a it's like a sort of mundane world rendered in
01:08:04 this kind of cartoon style I don't know anyway you just you just make cheese and the mailman
01:08:10 comes by and is like got any cheese oh no cheese oof sucks see you later bro yeah cring yeah you
01:08:18 literally it's like oh great the mailman will like the mailman will give will sell you these like
01:08:26 treasures he'll sell you these like fucking like far off like magical treasures from like
01:08:30 ancient times or whatever that have these big like highfalutin descriptions I think they're all
01:08:35 worthless I think there's no point to any of them uh and I I don't know why they're a thing in the
01:08:41 game I feel like it's maybe it's just another thing to like distract you from the point and I
01:08:49 don't know what the point is the point is I don't know I don't I don't know what the point of the
01:08:56 game is but I but I guess I would recommend it anyway there's another game that I thought looked
01:09:01 cool and I fucked around with only for a few minutes and I was like maybe I'll get back to this
01:09:05 and fuck around more and I haven't yet it's called Mendel as in Gregor Mendel and it's like
01:09:11 you land on an alien planet I guess and there are these different plants and you can go around
01:09:18 and discover plants and name them you give them whatever name you want and then you can like
01:09:23 take samples of them and like combine them and I guess it's sort of combines their genes I guess
01:09:30 the game has some sort of like genetic modeling component somewhere in its code and you combine
01:09:35 their genes and it produces a new plant that like combines their traits in some way and then you can
01:09:40 name the new plant that you've made by combining them and stuff and I guess it's just sort of a
01:09:45 fuck around and make weird plants kind of thing which is cool and the kind of thing that I could
01:09:50 get into if I was in the right mood but I didn't I didn't get that far into it uh
01:09:58 what else did I play I haven't I haven't I've never played night in the woods but now I guess
01:10:02 I own it because I got the bundle um I think I've probably already mentioned uh a short hike which
01:10:09 is great yes I played that on this I played that on a stream one time well like a year ago
01:10:14 and it's a really cool video game and uh the the I think I mentioned this too but the dev the dev
01:10:21 of the game like showed up to my stream one time because I tweeted I was streaming it and I guess
01:10:24 he saw and that was pretty that was pretty based that was you you play as Reginald you play as
01:10:31 Reginald from Beartato you know who that is no there's a webcomic called Reginald and Beartato
01:10:40 and it it's the the main Reginald okay the the website is called Nedroid but um yeah the
01:10:47 character the character in in um a short hike looks exactly like the stupid bird Reginald from
01:10:54 Nedroid and it's very funny it's like ha ha there he is that's it that's my observation
01:11:02 hey uh uh Ben I think yeah I might need to leave quite soon because there's a thing that we're
01:11:09 gonna do uh and it requires it is uh like light sensitive like the sunset happening
01:11:17 oh do you might do you want to can I know what it is oh yeah yeah we're just gonna do a bonfire
01:11:23 but it was like a fireless day thing oh okay uh all right fair enough well do you want to do you
01:11:29 want to start voicemails or if you got to leave soon I can just do voicemails I'll just fucking do
01:11:36 it myself man I don't I don't give a fuck you can you uh what do you want to do that I don't know um
01:11:45 how how soon are the are the okay I have not gone I have not gone through them uh but there are
01:11:53 have you not prepared them to play no I have not prepared them to play I I was just gonna play them
01:11:58 on uh a speak pipe oh and you personally would okay yeah in that case uh that's gonna take too
01:12:06 long so I will do and then you can do the voice unless I mean the only other way if you did want
01:12:11 to do them is if you just logged on to speak pipe and we both just hit play at the same time
01:12:15 um but if you gotta go then it's fine yeah sorry I genuinely I genuinely don't mind doing it
01:12:23 okay well happy father's day uh I will do I will I will soldier on um and I'm uh good good good talk
01:12:34 uh yeah yeah cool I didn't didn't really feel like didn't really feel that much like recording
01:12:40 an episode but that's okay no but I mean that's fine I don't care it's it's weird doing a two man
01:12:49 it sure is I wonder why I wonder why it's come to this why is it like this what's everyone
01:12:59 fucking doing what's so goddamn important uh sorry sorry sorry for my emotional literally
01:13:06 anything else yeah I guess I guess so um all right well I will see you all right man
01:13:16 oh put your fucking audio wait we gotta sync oh shit let's yeah we didn't think it okay I guess
01:13:21 we'll do this right now Ellie is our I don't care if you cut this do not use your own discretion
01:13:26 all right I will see you later later dog um well we're at an hour and 14
01:13:36 it's just me everyone hey it's time for the it's time I guess this we've returned to the part of
01:13:42 the episode that's just the Ben solo cast similar perhaps to what you might get monthly if you were
01:13:51 a five-dollar patron haha I'm doing it I'm fucking doing it at patreon.com slash ben saint where I do
01:13:58 the month I do the same thing that hippo does I stole the idea from him where I do the monthly
01:14:03 roundup Q&A kind of thing I do a little question and answer thing or you ask me whatever and then
01:14:09 I answer them and then it's just me and I talk about stuff um but you know I feel like I touched
01:14:16 I feel like in talking to hippo I touched on everything that I might have wanted to bring up
01:14:21 had it been the true solo Ben cast um so I guess it's time to go to voicemails yes um
01:14:33 let's let's hear let's hear from our good friend and I have not I have not uh edited these at all
01:14:41 I haven't listened to them beforehand so this is totally unfiltered and maybe if they really are
01:14:46 bad let's let's see let's see what Nate has to deal with every every time when he when he's like
01:14:51 going through them and picking let's have a raw uncut experience I will I guess I'll tell Ellie
01:14:57 is already cut any that I feel are not appropriate or good enough anyway this is from Pokemon's
01:15:04 greatest nemesis one thing I find especially funny about the traders of america list is that
01:15:11 there's pokemon listed uh and then there's pedo which is listed parentheses pokemon's greatest
01:15:18 nemesis um is so co context this this guy on twitter who I think was just doing it for attention
01:15:28 one that one angry gamer or one angry gamer he made this list that made the rounds of traders of
01:15:33 america and it was just have a god I hope I haven't talked about this before whatever it
01:15:40 and it was basically just like brands and celebrities or people who basically is just
01:15:45 supported black lives matter that's basically all you needed to do uh to to get on to get on this
01:15:51 traders of america this is people who are have betrayed the united states and uh oh god the
01:15:58 state of the world and um I got on it long story short I've said this before where where am I what's
01:16:06 what's happening um and uh so I guess pokemon's on it that's really funny uh and pita yeah you get it
01:16:13 you get the iron I don't have to explain but that's why this is happening that's why this is all
01:16:17 happening problem solved riddle answered okay next one from tom I love a zoomie please focus
01:16:22 all your effort into a zoomie I think he is doing that but whatever let's let's go
01:16:29 you know tom I just played a zoomie in the vertical slice for the first time
01:16:32 this is the same god a big fan of the character but I couldn't play the official game because
01:16:37 like my pc was shit and I had to fix it and then finally a zoomie I can finally do it
01:16:43 and I did it I beat the game basically like what is of that exists so far absolutely brilliant
01:16:51 the only problem that I have with it is that the jump button is C and the spacebar is like
01:16:55 literally right there and it would be so much more intuitive for me to use the spacebar maybe
01:17:02 like include a thing to map the controls to whatever you want you know like a menu to do that
01:17:08 so it would be uh very based anyways good game bro uh that's it
01:17:15 cool tom please respond uh I personally um I have only the only I have I have seen tom's
01:17:29 a zoomie updates I haven't played it since that first like vertical slice came out
01:17:36 so I don't know what the current I don't really know what the current state of it is
01:17:40 but uh I'm sure I'm sure it's looking good because it was looking good before and seems
