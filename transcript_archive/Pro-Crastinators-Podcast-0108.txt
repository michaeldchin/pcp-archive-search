00:00:00 Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:11 I am the best guy ever, and today we are joined by Ben Oliver.
00:00:19 Patreon.com slash Polystation 2 Hippocrates.
00:00:25 Franchises more like French Isis am I right?
00:00:35 And here's Lethal Aurora Mage, speaking of terrorists.
00:00:38 Why do my introductions always get interrupted?
00:00:42 I don't know.
00:00:44 The real terrorism is destroying intros.
00:00:48 I feel Nate has a grudge against me.
00:00:51 I didn't interrupt shit.
00:00:53 Don't blame me.
00:00:54 It was not my fault.
00:00:55 I've been here for zero responsibility here.
00:00:57 Alright, now I'm in a bad mood.
00:00:59 I'm ready to fight.
00:01:00 I'm ready to kill everybody today.
00:01:01 Let's fight.
00:01:02 Let's fight.
00:01:03 Let's do it.
00:01:04 Listen up, team.
00:01:06 Today's episode is Franchises, subtitle, and how to ruin them.
00:01:12 That is the overall theme that we're sticking with here.
00:01:16 So there's a lot of franchises in recent years that have just gone to shit.
00:01:21 And we're here to kind of discuss why.
00:01:24 What, if anything, can be done to avoid it for the ones that have survived,
00:01:28 the few that still remain.
00:01:30 And I guess, you know, also to examine the other side of the coin,
00:01:33 see who's doing well these days.
00:01:35 So let's get into it.
00:01:37 What do you think, guys?
00:01:38 Who's got an example?
00:01:39 Who wants to start us?
00:01:40 Wait, Urban Dictionary.
00:01:41 Urban Dictionary, what have I done?
00:01:43 What have I done?
00:01:44 Almost.
00:01:45 Almost got away with it.
00:01:47 The PCP franchise was almost cleansed.
00:01:49 I have a horrible meme, but.
00:01:51 Okay.
00:01:52 All right, Urban.
00:01:54 My friend, here is the definition of a franchise.
00:01:58 Franchise, an entire series of the film.
00:02:01 Wait, this doesn't have to be a film.
00:02:03 The original and all its subsequent sequels thereafter.
00:02:06 This is terrible.
00:02:08 No, what the fuck is this about?
00:02:10 Of course it's terrible.
00:02:11 It's Urban Dictionary.
00:02:12 Yeah.
00:02:13 I don't think this has ever been good.
00:02:15 Have we ever had a good definition?
00:02:17 No, that's not true.
00:02:18 Wait a minute.
00:02:19 Wait a minute.
00:02:20 Wait a minute.
00:02:21 Okay.
00:02:22 Oh, I get it.
00:02:23 Okay.
00:02:24 Fourth definition of franchise.
00:02:25 Franchise.
00:02:26 Verb.
00:02:27 To get it in, to smooch, a.k.a. to have sex.
00:02:30 And here's the example.
00:02:31 Did you franchise?
00:02:32 Oh, I franchised last night.
00:02:34 Hashtag sex, hashtag fuck, hashtag hookup, hashtag penis, hashtag smooch.
00:02:40 That's, I assume they mean that in like the fight club definition of franchising where
00:02:46 Ed Norton's dad, like said, a bunch of families of which he was one.
00:02:50 And he's like, you know, like that, that sort of thing.
00:02:53 You with me?
00:02:54 Yes.
00:02:55 You with me on that?
00:02:56 I understand.
00:02:57 But wow, I've never.
00:02:58 The thing about franchises.
00:03:00 The thing about franchises that I was going to talk about is that they sort of ruin certain
00:03:08 things within a franchise.
00:03:10 Like if you've got like a series of video games, good games are overlooked or like harshly
00:03:17 judged if there are better games in the same franchise.
00:03:20 Like the label brings down opinions on the things that are good because they're tied
00:03:26 to things that are better.
00:03:27 And then things that are bad are elevated because they're tied to things that are better
00:03:32 than them sometimes as well.
00:03:34 That's definitely true.
00:03:35 It's funny we're doing this topic when we are.
00:03:37 Because our good friend Jesse Wood just made a video all about this topic concerning the
00:03:42 God of War series.
00:03:43 That's very true.
00:03:44 It was very, very topically relevant and everyone should watch it because it was fucking fantastic.
00:03:48 It was a great classic Jesse video that everyone should definitely watch.
00:03:52 But probably link the show notes below.
00:03:54 But if you like that, what was interesting about his video was that it was less.
00:03:58 I mean, that actually was about kind of how like how much more credit the God of War series
00:04:03 deserves than it's currently getting just due to a change of Zeitgeist.
00:04:06 And people endlessly spinning their wheels about like how games should be art and getting
00:04:12 all wrapped up and insecure about Roger Ebert's ghost.
00:04:15 Like I feel like if the new God of War game wasn't a God of War game, people would not
00:04:20 be shitting on the old God of Wars because it's not connected by a franchise.
00:04:25 There's no reason to compare them.
00:04:27 I mean, it's just Jesse said.
00:04:29 They're just looking for an excuse to sound like this one's better.
00:04:32 Yeah, yeah.
00:04:34 I would.
00:04:35 I mean, as Jesse very well painted, people have simply just forgotten what happened or
00:04:40 never played a lot.
00:04:41 Like you'll hear like game commenters today.
00:04:43 Oh my God, I fucking hate these people.
00:04:45 They come out.
00:04:46 I mean, Jesse made a very, you know, we're just reiterating his case.
00:04:48 So go watch his video.
00:04:49 But it's just like they come out.
00:04:50 They're like, oh man, this is so much better than the character Kratos was way back in
00:04:54 the day.
00:04:55 It's like, oh, so you're experienced with it?
00:04:56 No, no, I haven't played any of them.
00:04:58 Right.
00:04:59 Yeah.
00:05:00 And then again, like Jesse points out in that video, like the whole, like you read the original
00:05:05 reviews for the OG God of War because I remember when it came out because I'm an old fart.
00:05:09 And I remember reading about it and like, oh man, Dave, you have to make the game and
00:05:12 all this shit.
00:05:13 Everyone was like, this is like Devil May Cry with an incredibly good story.
00:05:17 That was like the elevator pitch for the OG God of War.
00:05:21 God of War One had a great story.
00:05:22 Yeah.
00:05:23 Better than Devil May Cry once.
00:05:24 Definitely.
00:05:25 Definitely.
00:05:26 He actually had like character motivation and depth and complexity, which, and everyone
00:05:32 was like, this is why this game is so good.
00:05:34 It has everything.
00:05:35 I feel a meme brewing.
00:05:36 Oh, no.
00:05:37 I feel a meme brewing.
00:05:38 Wait, wait.
00:05:39 Kratos is like, he's holding like his dead wife and daughter's body.
00:05:42 And he's like, it was supposed to be my job to fill your dark soul with war.
00:05:47 No, not light.
00:05:48 See, I made a twist on it because it's God of War, not God of Demon Cry.
00:05:54 That's my joke.
00:05:55 Okay, it was a terrible joke.
00:05:56 I'll take the paycheck.
00:05:57 I don't like it.
00:05:58 It was the worst.
00:05:59 But yeah, no, it was good.
00:06:01 It was a good video and it kind of is on point because a lot of the times the new stuff in
00:06:08 the franchise is automatically classified as the betterer by some people, especially in
00:06:15 games.
00:06:16 That's why we need remasters and stuff because like, well, the old stuff's too old.
00:06:19 We got to make it more accessible and newer.
00:06:21 It's disgusting.
00:06:22 It's very specific to video games, but like the whole graphics thing needing to be updated
00:06:27 for people to even think about giving a shit.
00:06:30 People think about that about movies to a degree as well, but yeah, it's mostly games
00:06:33 for sure.
00:06:34 But it's not really because like movies, I mean, I guess movies still always had like,
00:06:40 you know, they never really changed the frame rate or increased.
00:06:44 The only thing they increased was like, you can put things on Blu-rays now, but you can
00:06:48 still turn like old, what are the millimeters, like 100,000 millimeter film?
00:06:54 35.
00:06:55 Right.
00:06:56 And also like put things in CGI now instead of like making puppets or stuff like that.
00:07:00 That's true.
00:07:01 Yeah.
00:07:02 That's true.
00:07:03 I mean, you look at like old like like 60 sci-fi and stuff.
00:07:05 It's hard.
00:07:06 Some people have a hard time like, you know, is the Gorn really that threatening?
00:07:10 It's like, come on.
00:07:12 Well, that's just terrible acting.
00:07:14 I mean, you know, things like Citizen Kane, for example, like, I don't think people look
00:07:22 at that movie and think to themselves like, man, this looks dated because of the artistry
00:07:27 of the thing.
00:07:28 It like really like the just the cinematography and the clear, like, I've actually watched
00:07:33 this movie a lot.
00:07:34 So I'm not talking to my ass like people always do about like, oh, it's Citizen Kane.
00:07:37 It's so good.
00:07:38 I actually have studied this film quite a bit and quite it really deserves all the praise
00:07:42 it gets.
00:07:43 And so like that's in an artistic way.
00:07:45 It stands up as opposed to, I mean, what I would argue about like, like a pixel based
00:07:51 Final Fantasy or even one like a Final Fantasy 7 versus like the Final Fantasy 15 struggle
00:07:57 for photorealism.
00:07:58 I think it moves.
00:07:59 Like the seven remake and stuff.
00:08:00 Film just ages more gracefully than video games do.
00:08:02 And that's just because it's still real life.
00:08:04 You know, like you're still it's it's like a very low resolution recording of real life
00:08:09 versus, hey, look, it's like seven polygons with like a five.
00:08:13 Well, image slapped on it.
00:08:14 I'm pretty sure I'd still enjoy watching like the Back to the Future movies just as much
00:08:19 as I did when I was a kid.
00:08:21 Yeah.
00:08:22 Yeah.
00:08:23 I mean, those are those like the special effects and those are actually pretty great
00:08:26 and hold up pretty well to this day.
00:08:28 Like they invented a lot of effects for that time anyways.
00:08:31 I think the thing is like, like when people say movies are too old to watch them.
00:08:35 I just realized there is definitely going to be a resurrection of the Back to the Future
00:08:38 series without question.
00:08:40 Oh yeah.
00:08:41 With Marty, Marty is now going to be an old professor.
00:08:45 He'll be the professor.
00:08:46 He'll be old and be like, hello, I'm old and now I'm smart.
00:08:49 Here I built another DeLorean.
00:08:51 That is probably the series that will be most fucked up by like reinvention and like doing
00:08:57 more because it's so reliant on time travel and like everything was really packaged in
00:09:01 those three movies.
00:09:02 I can't wait for it to show up on Netflix in a year or two.
00:09:05 Marta, she's too shaky, though, or whatever his name is.
00:09:08 Frightened.
00:09:09 He's got the, he's got the shakes, whatever that's called.
00:09:13 Another thing that's like just happened was that there was an announcement for a Thundercats.
00:09:19 We were just talking about this.
00:09:23 And it looks like every other cartoon out there at the moment.
00:09:27 It's literally Steven Universe.
00:09:29 It's Steven Universe Adventure Time, okay, KO, all of them.
00:09:33 Can we say officially that Cal Arts has ruined cartoons?
00:09:37 I mean, they have their legacy is it's too much.
00:09:40 It's simply too much.
00:09:41 I would say at this point, Cal Arts is a franchise that has been ruined.
00:09:45 Oh shit.
00:09:46 Yep.
00:09:47 Okay, just, I just want to, I just want to say something like I really dislike the art
00:09:52 style.
00:09:53 I'll say that like even emotion is just like, I don't like it.
00:09:57 However, I don't want to knock the series out before I've even seen it because like it
00:10:03 could have like good writing or something.
00:10:06 I am only commenting.
00:10:08 I completely do not care how good it is.
00:10:11 It is a reboot.
00:10:12 I'm tired.
00:10:13 I'm tired of things coming back.
00:10:15 I hear Tom Slade Queen.
00:10:17 I kill these fucking necromancers.
00:10:19 These skeletons stop coming back.
00:10:21 I can't get through all the catacombs.
00:10:23 I thought you liked skeletons.
00:10:25 Like, we're not the target audience though, guys.
00:10:30 That's fine.
00:10:31 Your opinion doesn't matter.
00:10:35 That's not fair to say.
00:10:37 My opinion is everything.
00:10:38 I'm on the internet.
00:10:39 My opinion means everything.
00:10:40 Well, actually, I was going to be more generous and say, I'm not judging the writing.
00:10:44 I'm just judging the art style.
00:10:46 But I think there's, right, right, right.
00:10:48 We can separate those.
00:10:49 I mean, after the really good 2011 reboot, how can you just turn around and turn it into
00:10:53 this?
00:10:54 Was there a reboot in 2011?
00:10:55 It was amazingly good.
00:10:57 Really?
00:10:58 Wait.
00:10:59 So actually.
00:11:00 Yeah, Fundercats.
00:11:01 Was it the Japanese anime one or whatever?
00:11:03 Japanese anime style.
00:11:04 Yeah.
00:11:05 It was gorgeously animated.
00:11:06 It had amazing, dude, there was a super fucking amazing episode because it was mostly a continuous
00:11:11 storyline, but then they had short one-off episodes.
00:11:14 And there was one episode that was super cool, and it's been a while since I've watched it.
00:11:18 But it was about Lyno's all depressed and shit.
00:11:21 He's a sad boy because shit's going bad.
00:11:23 And he comes on this race of small little flower people, and they only have 24 hours to live.
00:11:30 Their entire life is in 24 hours.
00:11:32 So he meets one of these characters as a newborn, and throughout the day, he sees him trying
00:11:37 to use his short little life to make a better impact for his people, and that reinvigorates
00:11:43 him to keep going forward and fighting.
00:11:45 And it's like the fucking sickest concept.
00:11:47 That sounds fucking incredible.
00:11:48 It's so good, dude.
00:11:50 It's fucking great.
00:11:51 And then they come out, they're like, what if we just made Teen Titans Go furry edition?
00:11:55 And I'm like, I'm so fucking angry.
00:11:57 Hey, Teen Titans Go, I like more than this because it has an original art style.
00:12:01 I give it more credit.
00:12:02 The whole thing about, like, we're not the target audience.
00:12:05 I don't...
00:12:07 Aren't we, though?
00:12:09 No, well, I mean, kind of.
00:12:11 The target audience...
00:12:13 The new kids don't remember sending cats.
00:12:15 They don't have kids.
00:12:17 But it's also going to be like, hey, guys, remember how old you are?
00:12:22 Now you can relive how old you are by thunder cats again.
00:12:26 Yeah.
00:12:27 Well, you know what I would say.
00:12:28 Well, mage, you don't know that it's not a more mature show with an older audience in mind.
00:12:32 So maybe we should all wait.
00:12:33 And maybe you should die.
00:12:35 The thing about it, though, is that stuff like...
00:12:39 It's just...
00:12:42 Ready Player One, Ready Player One, Thunder Cats, everything coming back,
00:12:45 it just makes me not like the things that they're originally attached to.
00:12:49 I'm sick and tired of reboots and remakes and rehashes
00:12:52 and reintroductions of old things that I haven't experienced.
00:12:55 So maybe I have experience.
00:12:56 And it just makes me like, okay, now I will never want to look at Thunder Cats
00:13:00 because of this fucking shit.
00:13:02 Everything that gets rebooted goes into a vault in my mind brain
00:13:07 where it's like, this is bad because it came back and I hate it
00:13:11 and I never want to see it and I hate everything associated with it.
00:13:14 And if I see anyone enjoying it, I'm just going to spit right in their eye.
00:13:18 I just want to say, I'm not describing your disappointment.
00:13:21 I fully agree. If someone took something I really liked when I was a kid
00:13:25 and rebooted into shit, I mean...
00:13:27 I have never seen it.
00:13:29 Yeah, I haven't seen it either.
00:13:31 But the thing is, I guess it's just...
00:13:33 Yeah, I'm also tired of the reboots.
00:13:36 If they wanted to do their completely own original weird cookie thing,
00:13:40 just do it with a new IP.
00:13:42 Why do you have to reboot Thunder Cats and make this thing?
00:13:45 Of course, people are not going to be happy.
00:13:48 And if your target audience is new kids that haven't seen the show before,
00:13:52 then just make an original show.
00:13:54 They're not going to care.
00:13:55 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
00:13:57 Where did the reruns go?
00:13:59 Reruns are so fucking easy and cheap.
00:14:02 You just do those, it's so much better.
00:14:04 You know, that is a really good point.
00:14:06 Because this is all about making a safe bet
00:14:09 and trying to make more money off the franchise.
00:14:12 Why even spend any money making a new show?
00:14:14 Just put all the money where it actually matters,
00:14:16 where all the money comes from for these fucking shows anyway.
00:14:19 Merchandise sales.
00:14:20 Just re-air Thunder Cats 2011 and drop more merch.
00:14:23 Or re-air the original, because everyone has memories of that.
00:14:27 But those are old and they look gay.
00:14:29 I feel weird in my penis and that's not good for me.
00:14:32 That's just the thing that gets me like,
00:14:34 oh, but all the Thunder Cats is in 4-3 resolution aspect ratio.
00:14:39 We can't air that.
00:14:40 That would be laughed out of town.
00:14:42 I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll just kill you if you think about that.
00:14:45 Just mirror the edges.
00:14:46 Us YouTubers have figured out the solution for airing 4-3.
00:14:50 All you do is zoom in on another layer and blur it out.
00:14:53 So then you have a 16x9.
00:14:55 Yeah, it works.
00:14:57 You could have a funny little side things,
00:15:01 pillars, drawn little side things.
00:15:03 Just draw the Thunder Cats roar characters as your border
00:15:07 and then just air the original.
00:15:08 Right. That could be the whole show.
00:15:10 It's in the border of a normal Thunder Cats episode.
00:15:12 Just imagine, guys, remember,
00:15:14 just think about all the hilarious epic meme references.
00:15:17 There's going to be two the 80s into old cartoons
00:15:20 in this incredible new show, Thunder Cats War.
00:15:23 Oh, it's going to be great.
00:15:24 I know that I'm reached.
00:15:25 I don't know. I haven't seen the show yet.
00:15:27 But I do feel that you can both, one, have fatigue for reboots
00:15:31 and two, also sincerely determine if a show is good or bad as it comes out.
00:15:36 I'm sure.
00:15:37 I'm sure you can.
00:15:38 Like Teen Titans Go is like one of those things where people hate it
00:15:42 just because, oh, it's not the same as Teen Titans.
00:15:46 But it's actually okay and it's kind of fun.
00:15:49 No, no.
00:15:50 Okay, like I like the original Teen Titans
00:15:53 and I wanted to give Teen Titans Go a shot
00:15:55 because when I first saw designs,
00:15:57 I kind of liked them.
00:15:58 They're cute and chibi sort of like, oh, that's neat kind of,
00:16:00 you know, that sort of thing.
00:16:02 It wasn't the same and I didn't expect it to be the same,
00:16:04 but I watched the show.
00:16:05 I watched several episodes
00:16:07 and I really didn't care for the humor, I guess.
00:16:10 Sure.
00:16:11 A lot of it was very mean spirited and that's what I dislike.
00:16:14 I mean...
00:16:15 What? No.
00:16:16 What are you talking about?
00:16:17 What was mean spirited?
00:16:18 I don't buy.
00:16:19 That episode with the pie, Mother May pie or something.
00:16:24 What's wrong with that?
00:16:25 I don't remember any mean spirited humor in that.
00:16:27 I hated the song.
00:16:29 Three of the Teen Titans got cooked into a pie
00:16:32 and then Cyborg and Beast Boy ate them.
00:16:35 But like, that was a joke.
00:16:37 I don't like, I don't like, I didn't like it.
00:16:40 I don't like that sort of humor.
00:16:42 I understand it because it's funny, but for me personally,
00:16:46 I really didn't like the humor of the show
00:16:49 and because the show relies heavily, like solely on its humor,
00:16:53 I didn't like the show.
00:16:55 Mostly you.
00:16:56 Okay.
00:16:57 Well, okay, fine.
00:16:58 The thing is the people that usually hate Teen Titans Go
00:17:01 hate it on a very surface level.
00:17:03 If you watched it and you didn't like it, then that's fine.
00:17:05 But most people, I think I've never given it a shot because
00:17:08 but, but what happened to my ones that I grew up with?
00:17:13 Where did they go?
00:17:15 Oh, yeah.
00:17:16 I feel like, same with the Powerpuff Girls reboot.
00:17:19 I also watched a few episodes because I wanted to see.
00:17:21 It's, I don't think I reached like the few episodes
00:17:25 that people were really, you know, talking about like the ones
00:17:29 with the twerking and whatnot.
00:17:31 But I've seen quite a few episodes.
00:17:32 I'm sorry, did you say twerking?
00:17:33 Yes, there was twerking in the Powerpuff Girls reboot.
00:17:35 What?
00:17:36 Wait, wait.
00:17:37 The Powerpuff Girls of these like six year old children
00:17:39 and twerking.
00:17:40 What's the...
00:17:41 That was awful.
00:17:42 I haven't seen the show but I've seen bits of like,
00:17:44 this is how terrible this is.
00:17:46 Yeah, I haven't seen, I haven't seen the show
00:17:48 but I think the context is like there's some sort of villain
00:17:51 maybe and they're like, then they're kind of drugged
00:17:54 and then like they twerk.
00:17:56 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:17:57 We're talking about drugged children twerking.
00:18:00 But like I'm just...
00:18:01 I'm just guessing that they're drugged
00:18:03 or like the illusion to being drugged.
00:18:04 What?
00:18:05 Okay, alright.
00:18:06 Nate, do you know there's a whole like conspiracy
00:18:08 in that show that one of the artists
00:18:10 where the show has a self-insert of himself
00:18:12 and maybe they're talking about himself.
00:18:13 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:18:14 No, no, no, no.
00:18:15 Who's the love interest, blossoming right?
00:18:16 But guys, guys, guys, no, like it came out
00:18:18 and like the artists people were making a joke
00:18:20 and they made the character without the person
00:18:22 actually being aware so it was meant to be
00:18:24 as an inside joke.
00:18:25 He didn't do it himself.
00:18:26 So we all got pranked.
00:18:27 Okay.
00:18:28 Okay.
00:18:29 There's a ton of disdain.
00:18:33 It's interesting, we're talking about all these shows, right?
00:18:35 And they run the gamut of we don't know how good they are,
00:18:39 if they're good or they're not good.
00:18:41 But they're all symptoms of a terrible disease
00:18:44 that has infected popular culture,
00:18:47 which is it's much safer to just rehash
00:18:51 what we've already done than to dare go
00:18:53 into uncharted waters.
00:18:55 It's a serious question that'll have.
00:18:56 I just want to finish one when I started
00:18:57 with the pop-up girls.
00:18:58 Like, yeah, so I seen a bit,
00:18:59 it's not as terrible as people make it out to be,
00:19:03 however, it's still pretty bad.
00:19:06 I mean, I dislike it, that's my personal opinion.
00:19:09 Some people might find it good,
00:19:10 but it's not, it doesn't have that charm, I guess.
00:19:14 But it's really not like the end of the world, you know?
00:19:17 It's not the end of the world,
00:19:18 but like there's a reason people get so upset,
00:19:22 because as much as I don't agree with the people
00:19:25 who react badly to Teen Titans Go,
00:19:28 I totally get why they would have such a reaction
00:19:31 when it's a completely different sort of show,
00:19:34 but with the same name as the one that they remember,
00:19:36 which was, you know.
00:19:37 Yeah, but like now speaking about franchises
00:19:39 and being ruined and stuff,
00:19:41 well, it was Teen Titans Go,
00:19:43 as much as like people like to dislike it,
00:19:45 it hasn't ruined the franchise in terms of like business
00:19:48 and stuff, because apparently it's making a lot of money
00:19:50 for a scene.
00:19:51 However, with the pop-up girls,
00:19:52 it is ruined.
00:19:54 I think it is ruining the franchise
00:19:57 because it's not making a lot of money
00:19:58 and I'm not sure why they're still making it.
00:20:00 Well, okay.
00:20:01 I'm not sure, and I might be wrong,
00:20:03 maybe they are making a lot of money or enough money.
00:20:05 Here's a serious question on this front though.
00:20:07 Okay, so the Teen Titans like show,
00:20:10 like I never read, I know it's based on the comic books,
00:20:12 I never read them, so they're completely irrelevant to me.
00:20:14 And also Powerpuff Girls was like mostly like just a show.
00:20:18 I know it'd been, there was like an actual anime,
00:20:19 may have been stuff a while back,
00:20:21 but like it, they were mostly, they were what they were,
00:20:23 like the one show.
00:20:25 Okay, but like, so when we talk about ruining a franchise,
00:20:29 like for example, does it ruin the franchise
00:20:32 of Teen Titans to make Teen Titans go
00:20:35 when like, frankly, the series
00:20:37 simply would have remained dead without it?
00:20:40 All right, the way I see ruining franchise is that
00:20:44 it's, you can see it from like a money perspective,
00:20:48 in which case,
00:20:49 loads of terrible things are completely fine
00:20:54 because they make money
00:20:55 and the franchises aren't ruined in that sense.
00:20:59 But like the way I think about it is that
00:21:01 it's a personal thing.
00:21:02 If you feel like you're enjoyment or you're like it,
00:21:06 you know, something about one of the things
00:21:09 in a franchise spoiling the others in some way
00:21:12 and making you feel bad
00:21:13 when you think about the thing as a whole.
00:21:15 You know, like, oh man,
00:21:16 that would be the perfect series of movies
00:21:19 unless they, and you know,
00:21:21 that one right there ruins a lot of them.
00:21:24 Yeah, another thing I think is like
00:21:26 from the consumer perspective,
00:21:28 it's about the legacy of the show.
00:21:29 Teen Titans was very much beloved
00:21:33 and although people really, really wanted like
00:21:35 a sequel or a continuation or just, you know,
00:21:37 to finish the fucking series because it wasn't finished.
00:21:41 People remembered it fondly and they were very, you know,
00:21:44 and they liked it a lot,
00:21:45 but now whenever people think about Teen Titans,
00:21:47 they can't help but think about Teen Titans Go as well.
00:21:50 And the fondness just sort of like gets pushed it aside
00:21:55 and like the anger and the disappointment takes first place.
00:21:59 So the legacy of the series is now ruined
00:22:01 because Teen Titans Go exists.
00:22:03 Yeah, it's really gross how like something
00:22:06 that has fans and followers is like as long as it's,
00:22:12 you know, it has like people who regard it fondly.
00:22:16 As long as there's that, it will eventually be, you know,
00:22:19 exploited for money down the road unless you have an author
00:22:23 like the guy who made Calvin and Hobbes
00:22:25 who like explicitly forbade any adaptation of his work.
00:22:29 And so that is like super beloved
00:22:32 because no movie has come around
00:22:35 to fucking ruin it for everyone.
00:22:36 It's just perfect forever.
00:22:40 I mean, yeah, copyright expires in 80 years
00:22:42 and like some like fucking brain Najara
00:22:44 has been waiting since this little late 70s is like,
00:22:47 finally I can make my CTI Calvin and Hobbes movie.
00:22:52 Isn't that recently occurring for like The Catcher in the Rye?
00:22:56 I forget the name of the guy who wrote that.
00:22:57 I thought that happened like they were,
00:22:59 I know he expressly forbid the thing to happen
00:23:01 and I believe he's still alive.
00:23:03 I can't fucking remember his name, I'll tell you.
00:23:05 J.D. Salinger.
00:23:06 J.D. Salinger, that's the one.
00:23:08 I don't know, whatever, just throwing that out there.
00:23:11 Well, I mean, when I think about these questions
00:23:14 like legacy and stuff, that's a fair point.
00:23:16 But like there's two different ways
00:23:18 things can be ruined in my mind.
00:23:20 Like Final Fantasy comes to mind a lot
00:23:23 and I'm sure I'll discuss that a bunch in this podcast.
00:23:26 But like, so there's two different things
00:23:28 going on with Final Fantasy.
00:23:29 One, there is the current constant ever changing
00:23:32 Final Fantasy series that itself like is still being developed
00:23:37 and like never stopped from like the 80s when it started.
00:23:40 So like you could definitely say
00:23:41 that like Final Fantasy as a series has been ruined
00:23:45 because they continue to put out, you know, like worse products.
00:23:47 I mean, I know a lot of people like 15,
00:23:49 like that doesn't even matter.
00:23:50 Like you can make a case along those lines.
00:23:52 But then just as one example,
00:23:54 there is the specifically Final Fantasy 7.
00:23:58 And so Final Fantasy 7 exists as one game
00:24:00 that came out at one time.
00:24:02 But then they made sequels and prequels
00:24:05 and side stories and a million different things
00:24:08 and books and visual novels and all kinds of crazy shit
00:24:11 as well as they are currently working
00:24:13 on the remake of the game.
00:24:15 So the game itself, like so the Final Fantasy series
00:24:18 is one franchise that you might consider ruined
00:24:22 by later games that are actually changing
00:24:24 what the Final Fantasy series actually is.
00:24:27 But Final Fantasy 7, it is what it is at that time.
00:24:31 You know, like if they updated it for like,
00:24:34 there's like a PC release or whatever,
00:24:35 there's updated stuff,
00:24:36 the remake will obviously be a huge change.
00:24:38 They've added lore with all the side games.
00:24:40 But that original game is what it is.
00:24:43 And it will never be different
00:24:45 as long as you have a copy and don't lose your fucking copy.
00:24:47 I'm gonna protect mine like the fucking sacred tomb.
00:24:52 So like has the legacy of Final Fantasy 7 been ruined?
00:24:58 Is like, I think the answer is like to the public, yes.
00:25:02 Because everybody thinks about like Zach Fair
00:25:04 and Crisis Core and the Turks and all these side stories.
00:25:07 All these other things.
00:25:08 To me, like if I was gonna define like what this would be,
00:25:11 like what like ruining a franchise is,
00:25:14 I think it's like either the erosion or negligence
00:25:18 of the artistic merit of a property.
00:25:20 I think that pretty much sums it up, you know,
00:25:23 like either through like continued like,
00:25:25 iterance, like the original idea that like
00:25:28 attractive people in the first place
00:25:29 gets kind of lost in the shuffle.
00:25:31 Or like it's just blatantly ignored
00:25:33 for a crazy like left turn.
00:25:35 Usually both of these are done with monetary hopes
00:25:39 from corporations and stuff who never really understood
00:25:41 the merit of the franchise to begin with.
00:25:43 You know what comes to mind for this though?
00:25:45 I think about like, if someone today says like,
00:25:47 I've heard about Final Fantasy 7,
00:25:49 let me get into that thing.
00:25:51 Like that person will experience not what was intended
00:25:56 when the first game came out, you know?
00:25:58 Unless they start from the beginning.
00:25:59 If they start, but see, that's what I was gonna say.
00:26:01 I was gonna say that like for me,
00:26:03 as like an old fan of the series,
00:26:05 like what I do in my brain,
00:26:06 I've played almost every of the compilation games
00:26:09 and I'll play the remake, I'm sure too,
00:26:11 just to find out what's going on.
00:26:13 But like in my mind, I simply discard everything
00:26:16 that happened outside of the original game.
00:26:20 Now it's unfortunate because things like
00:26:22 Cloud's personality and because of how great
00:26:25 and interesting like a character Cloud is
00:26:28 and how nuanced and how amorphous he was
00:26:31 even in his old game.
00:26:32 It's given people like Nomura an excuse to depict him,
00:26:36 you know, in ways that I would argue
00:26:38 he should not have been depicted
00:26:39 in like subsequent games and prequels and stuff.
00:26:42 So like, I definitely can't help but have the character
00:26:46 as a monolith tainted in my own mind.
00:26:49 But if someone could just play the original game
00:26:53 and ignore everything that happens,
00:26:54 but the reason is how would they know to do that?
00:26:57 They wouldn't know to do that.
00:26:58 They had no fucking idea.
00:27:00 Yeah, I still, it's hard to like say
00:27:05 that a franchise can be like...
00:27:06 I've never played any of the Final Fantasy games, by the way.
00:27:08 Okay.
00:27:09 I just want to say, and I've been curious
00:27:11 about playing Final Fantasy 7 specifically,
00:27:14 but there was like a steam seal that I didn't take up
00:27:17 or didn't take advantage of of all the Final Fantasy games.
00:27:23 I really wanted to play like as many games as I could,
00:27:25 you know, in order to see what's up and stuff.
00:27:28 Okay.
00:27:28 Well, your boy Hippo did play it
00:27:30 and was just talking when you interrupted him.
00:27:32 So let's see what he is to say.
00:27:34 I've been waiting to say this for a while
00:27:36 because you were talking as well.
00:27:37 So I guess interruptions...
00:27:38 So let's just interrupt Hippo, not me.
00:27:40 That makes sense, that makes sense.
00:27:41 If you can't beat him, join him wagon
00:27:43 when it comes to interrupting people.
00:27:44 She's had enough of being interrupted
00:27:46 and dealing it back out.
00:27:48 This is all Nate's fault, let's agree.
00:27:51 Sure, I agree.
00:27:53 Gabe, what were you saying?
00:27:54 I forgot.
00:27:55 Well, any thoughts on the legacy of Final Fantasy VII
00:28:00 as someone who's recently played that game?
00:28:01 Oh, I remembered.
00:28:02 The idea, I think, I don't agree
00:28:06 that a franchise can be ruined for the public necessarily.
00:28:12 With education, they can figure out
00:28:14 what's good and bad probably.
00:28:15 That's probably true.
00:28:16 Yeah, because like...
00:28:17 But do they get that education?
00:28:18 If nobody plays the original Final Fantasy VII
00:28:20 in the way that it was intended again,
00:28:24 but they play like the remake and they like that.
00:28:28 There's an argument to be made
00:28:30 that they're not getting like the true experience
00:28:34 because maybe the remake is not as good.
00:28:37 I mean, it may be good, but we don't know...
00:28:39 No, no, no, why do you say it?
00:28:41 No, what I'm saying is that I think the franchiseness
00:28:48 of the fact that this is a remake of another thing,
00:28:51 but they're different, is what is the problem here,
00:28:54 because they may prefer on a base level,
00:28:59 human, like this is what I feel at the very core of my being.
00:29:03 They may prefer whatever the remake becomes
00:29:07 to the original game, but if they were not franchise connected,
00:29:12 they could just see them as two different things.
00:29:15 There's Final Fantasy VII, the game, it's an old thing.
00:29:18 And then there's this new thing that is not supposed
00:29:22 to replace it, but it is implicitly being a replacement
00:29:26 because of it sharing the name and being a remake,
00:29:29 which is why I think franchises like destroy the legacy
00:29:33 of things for people who come into them later,
00:29:36 unless they do a lot of research to,
00:29:40 unless they put in a lot of effort to sift through
00:29:43 all of the updated new things that have muddied the waters.
00:29:49 Okay, I wanna quickly say,
00:29:50 I've been playing Shin Megami Tensei,
00:29:52 and that's like all those balls franchise, I will say.
00:29:55 It's like older than Pokemon from my knowledge.
00:29:58 And like I played the fourth game
00:30:01 and I started playing the apocalypse.
00:30:03 And I did a lot of digging like with the history
00:30:06 of the Shin Megami Tensei because I wanted to know,
00:30:08 because it fascinated me, like something this old existed
00:30:12 and it just, I liked it.
00:30:14 And from my knowledge, the franchise was never
00:30:18 sort of ruined by any game.
00:30:20 And all the spinoffs were either mildly successful
00:30:23 or became persona, which like super successful.
00:30:27 So like, I think it's an example of a franchise
00:30:30 that's like hasn't been ruined yet,
00:30:32 despite it's very long lifespan.
00:30:35 And although I-
00:30:36 I know that some people, sorry.
00:30:38 Yeah, I know some people have been sort of complaining
00:30:41 about the newer games for some reasons, like, oh, they-
00:30:45 A lot of old school fans, don't they say that like,
00:30:47 they're mad that the focus has gone to like persona
00:30:49 and that like that side of the Shin Megami Tensei?
00:30:52 I've heard some degree of that.
00:30:53 At some point was, but then they revived Shin Megami Tensei
00:30:56 with Shin Megami Tensei 4 and the apocalypse
00:30:58 and there's gonna be a new Shin Megami Tensei on the Switch.
00:31:01 So it hasn't died and has actually has been sort of revived.
00:31:05 And a lot of people because of persona are turning,
00:31:08 you know, their focus on Shin Megami Tensei
00:31:10 because they want something of similar but not the same
00:31:13 like me because I started with,
00:31:15 I sort of started with Persona 4,
00:31:18 that MMO game that I talked about aside
00:31:20 because I wasn't even,
00:31:21 I didn't even know it was a franchise at that time.
00:31:24 Anywho, but like, yeah, I started with Persona,
00:31:25 I really liked Persona 4, I couldn't play Persona 5,
00:31:29 still can't, I want to, but yeah.
00:31:31 And instead I turned to Shin Megami Tensei
00:31:34 because it seemed like, you know, something I'd like.
00:31:37 At first I was sort of a little bit turned off
00:31:40 because of the, even in the fourth game,
00:31:42 which is pretty recent and Apocalypse also,
00:31:45 recent enough, I think,
00:31:46 but they still had like the sprites
00:31:48 rather than like 3D models and stuff.
00:31:50 And it sort of feel like very clunky
00:31:53 and sort of like bloated, not bloated,
00:31:55 but like very visually heavy, I guess,
00:31:59 not heavy, overloading, like, not sure how to say it.
00:32:03 Well, so are you saying that like,
00:32:05 what you're saying is that like the games
00:32:07 that some people might consider ruining something
00:32:09 actually can bring people into the fold
00:32:11 and expose them to, you know,
00:32:13 like aspects of the series
00:32:15 that maybe the hardcore fans would say,
00:32:16 like, is the real experience
00:32:18 or something along those lines?
00:32:19 No, I'm saying, no, what I was trying to say is just like,
00:32:23 originally I was sort of turned off by the graphics
00:32:26 that kind of looked very outdated,
00:32:28 but then I played the game
00:32:29 and I really liked the story and the setting
00:32:30 and the idea and the mechanic.
00:32:32 I think the heart of the Shin Megami Tensei
00:32:34 still lives on through its franchise,
00:32:36 the Persona thing aside,
00:32:38 it's become its own thing very much.
00:32:42 So it's like very different games.
00:32:43 Like, but I think Shin Megami Tensei
00:32:45 has always had that core sort of fight
00:32:48 between good and evil, but not like,
00:32:50 I mean, the demons and the angels
00:32:52 and the apocalypse happening
00:32:54 and like world going to hell.
00:32:56 It's always seemed to have had that theme.
00:32:58 I think originally started like on a small scale-ish,
00:33:02 now it's becoming bigger and bigger over time.
00:33:04 I'm not too certain because so many games,
00:33:07 but yeah, and it's just like,
00:33:11 I think it's still a good franchise
00:33:12 and although some people are grumbling
00:33:14 about the changes, however,
00:33:15 like you can't remake the exactly same game each time
00:33:19 whenever a new game is made,
00:33:21 changes are gonna happen.
00:33:23 And some changes I think are made for the better.
00:33:25 They're like sometimes-
00:33:26 But if the changes are bad,
00:33:27 then it's fair to criticize them, right?
00:33:29 Oh yeah, that's fair.
00:33:30 I mean, but I haven't seen like legit criticism above,
00:33:35 like, oh, it's different than what I remember it to be.
00:33:39 I mean, there was one,
00:33:41 like there's like a legit one
00:33:42 that like the overall world map was very,
00:33:44 very confusing and hard to navigate on the fourth,
00:33:46 but they improved upon it on the fourth game, Apocalypse,
00:33:51 which was meant to be a DLC,
00:33:52 but it became its own thing.
00:33:53 It became too big to be just a DLC,
00:33:55 so they made a separate game out of it.
00:33:57 That's what I've heard anyway.
00:33:59 But yeah, my point is it's a good franchise
00:34:02 and I'm happy to experience it
00:34:06 and I'm happy to say that it hasn't gone to shit yet.
00:34:09 Hopefully it won't.
00:34:11 I don't like this idea
00:34:15 that I am like guilty of sometimes,
00:34:19 that if you don't like the new thing in a franchise,
00:34:23 you're a grumpy old man
00:34:24 and you're just looking back
00:34:26 in the nostalgia goggles and all that,
00:34:29 because I definitely have done that for a few things,
00:34:33 but I don't like the idea that it's okay to be that either.
00:34:38 Sometimes new things are just good and they're not for me,
00:34:43 but like I was saying,
00:34:43 it's like the franchise has kind of tricked me
00:34:46 into needing to have an opinion on it
00:34:48 because it's from something that I used to like,
00:34:50 which was different from a different time.
00:34:52 And now this new thing is coming around with the same name
00:34:56 and it's the new one and oh,
00:34:58 but it's made for a completely different generation of people
00:35:00 and I don't like it.
00:35:02 Do I criticize it?
00:35:04 Do I get mad?
00:35:05 I don't really know what to do sometimes.
00:35:09 Yeah, just like the God of War game
00:35:11 is just made for like modern gamers
00:35:14 and so they had to completely change the kind of game it was
00:35:17 because nobody likes action games anymore.
00:35:19 There's a case to be made that some things
00:35:20 are better than other things
00:35:22 in terms of like the thematic relevance of like,
00:35:25 the original game in every franchise
00:35:27 is usually the one that makes the most sense
00:35:29 with all the reasons for everything being put there.
00:35:32 And then everything after that is some kind of like muddying
00:35:36 of the general idea.
00:35:37 Like with the Dark Demon Blood series,
00:35:40 Demon Souls is like the most,
00:35:44 the perfect like mixture of the way the game was told
00:35:48 and what is in the game
00:35:50 and the way it's played and everything.
00:35:51 And then beyond, after that,
00:35:53 it's sort of shifted in Dark Souls
00:35:56 and then Dark Souls 2 and then Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3
00:36:00 into something that's just a bit far removed
00:36:03 from like you're a real human being or you're a dead guy
00:36:09 and you're trying to survive at,
00:36:11 you've got a realistic-ish strength level
00:36:14 and you're trying to survive in this harsh world
00:36:15 that is fucking going to destroy you.
00:36:18 But then in Dark Souls 3,
00:36:20 it's like you are a super being from the very beginning
00:36:23 and you're really fast and you dodge well, super good.
00:36:27 And it's like the message is different.
00:36:30 And that doesn't even make sense
00:36:30 because like in Bloodborne,
00:36:32 you're designed to be like a speedy dashy guy,
00:36:34 but you're wearing like heavy plate
00:36:36 and doing this shit in Dark Souls 3.
00:36:37 Yeah, Dark Souls 3 is just sort of,
00:36:39 it's not bad, which is the thing,
00:36:42 but it's like, it's a muddy,
00:36:43 it's a, it's a, it's a removal,
00:36:46 removal of the core of reason for like stuff.
00:36:51 So, so like what you're arguing is that like,
00:36:54 there can be an artistic thing that was done
00:36:57 in the original thing that can be diminished
00:36:59 as sequels go along.
00:37:00 It can be diminished, but like there's no reason
00:37:02 to think that if it's not perfectly artistically cohesive
00:37:06 with gameplay and whatever.
00:37:08 I'm talking mostly about games
00:37:10 because I don't really watch movies.
00:37:11 Sure, sure.
00:37:12 But like, you know, there can be that,
00:37:15 but there's nothing to say that you should like the old game
00:37:20 or the old one more, even if you like the new one,
00:37:23 because it's a game you like more.
00:37:27 It's just, it's just always confusing
00:37:28 because they're the same franchise
00:37:30 and there's different things.
00:37:32 Franchises should not exist.
00:37:34 They should not.
00:37:35 That's, I mean, I definitely want to say a thing about that.
00:37:38 Yeah, I wanted to say something, but you can go Nate.
00:37:43 Okay. Well, I was just going to say that like,
00:37:45 so when it comes to like,
00:37:48 my mind keeps going back to Final Fantasy 7
00:37:50 as like the main example in my mind.
00:37:51 And it's like, so that is a little different
00:37:54 in the sense that like, well,
00:37:55 actually Dark Souls had direct sequels,
00:37:57 but like there was Final Fantasy 7
00:38:00 that had its own artistic integrity, love or hate it,
00:38:03 you know, whatever it was, it was its own thing.
00:38:05 And then you've got years later,
00:38:06 they make Advent Children.
00:38:07 It was like the first thing that was made
00:38:09 for this compilation of Final Fantasy 7,
00:38:11 which was followed by many games and whatnot.
00:38:13 Like, okay, you could theoretically make a prequel
00:38:16 to Final Fantasy 7, which actually they did.
00:38:17 There were some animated films
00:38:19 that came out before Advent Children.
00:38:21 There was at least one, I think it was called Before Crisis.
00:38:23 That's just like an anime version
00:38:24 of what happened in Nibelheim
00:38:26 between like Zack Cloud and Sephiroth.
00:38:28 And like a prequel that just makes the events of the game
00:38:32 into an anime, like that's totally fine.
00:38:35 Like that generally doesn't hurt anything
00:38:36 and is pretty decent.
00:38:38 Now, the problem is when you make sequels
00:38:41 to Final Fantasy 7,
00:38:43 that's when artistic integrity gets its Achilles heel sliced
00:38:47 because the entire point of the end of that game
00:38:51 was there was a question as to whether or not humanity
00:38:55 was going to be wiped out.
00:38:57 And like, we don't know the answer to that question
00:39:00 at the end of Final Fantasy 7.
00:39:02 By making sequels, and that was the whole point
00:39:05 that we as the viewers have to wonder ourselves,
00:39:08 are human beings actually a plague on the earth?
00:39:11 It was about the environment.
00:39:13 It was an environmental question.
00:39:14 It was about the nature of mankind.
00:39:16 Are we deserving of survival?
00:39:17 Are we just a virus on this planet the way Genova was?
00:39:20 Or do we actually deserve to live here
00:39:22 as part of this ecosystem and this world we're on?
00:39:26 That is the question asked at the end of Final Fantasy 7
00:39:28 and we do not know the answer.
00:39:30 So you are given the homework to spend the rest of your life
00:39:33 thinking about the ending to that game.
00:39:36 Until Advent Children comes out a couple years later,
00:39:39 when they say, nope, everything's fine, humans are cool,
00:39:42 don't worry about it, they just got Geostigma.
00:39:45 So shut the hell up, everybody.
00:39:48 Like bad, like no, stop.
00:39:50 I watched Advent Children without having any context
00:39:54 for any games or anything.
00:39:56 And I was young and I quite liked it.
00:39:58 It was like, ooh, shiny, basically.
00:40:00 I liked it at first too when I first saw it
00:40:02 because I also was just like, ooh, shiny.
00:40:04 Because I hadn't really thought seriously
00:40:06 about what it all meant.
00:40:08 But then as the years went on, I did and I am where I am now.
00:40:11 But like, so that's just one example.
00:40:14 I did a full cosplay of Vincent Valentine in my youth.
00:40:17 Made his gauntlet, made his whole thing.
00:40:19 And there's a picture of it, there's pictures of it around.
00:40:22 But anyway, I worked at an anime convention
00:40:24 to work at Anime Boston.
00:40:25 I wanted to make my larger point here
00:40:27 and it's specifically about,
00:40:29 and keeping with what Ghib was saying,
00:40:31 it's why I hate franchises.
00:40:33 And it's this, it's a whole bunch of things.
00:40:36 But it's, it's a whole bunch of things.
00:40:38 And I think it's a whole bunch of things.
00:40:40 And I think it's a whole bunch of things.
00:40:43 But it's, any time that is spent on making a sequel to a game
00:40:48 is time that could instead be made
00:40:51 making like a new thing with original ideas.
00:40:53 And there are absolutely sequels that are good,
00:40:57 that improve various things.
00:40:58 But I'm approaching this from the lens of like,
00:41:02 like how much intellectual content really in the story.
00:41:04 I know a lot of people don't care about fucking stories
00:41:06 and games, but I do.
00:41:08 And I, and you know, the whole Gazambkutsfark
00:41:10 of story working with gameplay, blah, blah, blah,
00:41:12 all that bullshit.
00:41:13 And it's like when, when you have to sit down
00:41:15 as like a game designer,
00:41:16 cause I have been a game designer many times.
00:41:18 I know what it's like, even though I don't do it right now.
00:41:21 Like you have to sit down and think about,
00:41:24 okay, what's the whole basis of our game gonna be?
00:41:26 And you really have to go through an intense struggle
00:41:29 to come up with something original.
00:41:31 And that's where the most of the intellectual labor is done
00:41:35 when you're making a game.
00:41:36 It's when you come up with the concept
00:41:38 and then like all the shit that comes afterward
00:41:40 is all like filling in the blank.
00:41:41 So that's, you know, that's how you make your game.
00:41:43 So like, you know what, this brings to mind
00:41:45 when I was doing the weed cast with Digi and the boys
00:41:50 and we would watch episode one
00:41:51 of like every anime that came out in a season.
00:41:54 I loved doing that because episode one
00:41:57 of every single show that's ever made for the most part
00:42:00 is interesting or absurd or just,
00:42:04 it stands out generally in some way.
00:42:08 But the thing is, watching another 11 episodes
00:42:11 of that thing generally for most shows is not worth it
00:42:14 because you're not getting that like,
00:42:18 that spark that's like leading into a whole show
00:42:21 when you watch the whole thing.
00:42:22 You get all the ideas presented in episode one
00:42:25 and then they string it out for 11 episodes in some way.
00:42:27 And you know, a lot of the times that makes sense
00:42:29 because it's a complicated narrative, whatever.
00:42:30 But the point I'm getting at is what I really liked
00:42:33 about that and the good thing I get from that is
00:42:35 when you're forced to like start over
00:42:37 and start from the very beginning
00:42:38 and come up with a unique premise,
00:42:40 that's where most interesting things that I like in a show
00:42:43 and generally in a video game as well, like are done.
00:42:46 It's at that first stage.
00:42:47 So to go on and spend a million fucking years
00:42:51 reinventing the wheel and trying to come up
00:42:52 with sequels to games to just like refine art
00:42:55 or refine gameplay or you know, make a sequel to a show
00:42:58 and like find excuses to like have like new characters
00:43:01 show up in season two.
00:43:02 Like, oh, cause we didn't mention them
00:43:04 cause they were off doing a secret mission
00:43:05 but now they're back
00:43:06 and here they are main character of season two.
00:43:09 I hate all that shit.
00:43:10 It's terrible.
00:43:11 It generally, I'm not gonna say every time
00:43:13 but a lot of the time it violates artistic integrity
00:43:16 and like to all the things that the big push right now
00:43:19 of like doing like the big remake thing,
00:43:22 the reboots and whatnot.
00:43:24 It's just like I do not blame studios for doing it.
00:43:28 They've got to make money.
00:43:29 They've got, you know, bills to pay.
00:43:31 What I hate is when people just are content with it
00:43:35 and accept it and are just like, yeah,
00:43:36 this is a perfectly good use of everyone's time.
00:43:39 Like this ThunderCats reboot, maybe it will be great.
00:43:42 I don't know, but I don't want people to think
00:43:45 that it's a good thing to do to spend all their time
00:43:49 making a new ThunderCats show when they could instead
00:43:52 be making something actually original, you know,
00:43:55 from the premise up.
00:43:56 Okay, I still have a point to say.
00:44:01 So like, oh, I wanted to bring up a franchise
00:44:03 that I also like, Dragon Age.
00:44:06 I really, really like Dragon Age.
00:44:08 It's one of my favorite franchises, I guess.
00:44:12 I really love the first game
00:44:14 and the second game got bashed to the ground
00:44:17 because people hated it so much because of the changes
00:44:20 and like, not just the changes,
00:44:22 like it was lacking severely in a lot of things.
00:44:26 And like, it was obviously a very rushed project
00:44:29 and it looked, it felt more like a DLC
00:44:33 and it didn't connect so well, story-wise.
00:44:36 Like, there were a lot of problems.
00:44:37 However, I still liked Dragon Age too
00:44:40 as blasphemous as it is to say.
00:44:43 I quite liked it.
00:44:44 And now after, you know, talking with you guys
00:44:47 about all this.
00:44:48 Is that the one with all the gay minotaurs and stuff?
00:44:49 Is that the one?
00:44:50 No, I mean.
00:44:52 No? Okay.
00:44:53 Okay, okay.
00:44:54 Maybe a little bit.
00:44:55 Konari, maybe if you're talking about Konari,
00:44:58 they're not minotaurs, but they are people
00:45:00 with giant horns in their heads, most of them.
00:45:02 Yeah.
00:45:03 Is there a big gay one?
00:45:04 Is there a big gay one?
00:45:05 It's in the third game, not the second one.
00:45:06 Maybe.
00:45:07 Ah, okay.
00:45:08 My apologies.
00:45:09 But yeah.
00:45:10 So in the second game.
00:45:11 That's the one Nate's interested in, for sure.
00:45:13 Yeah, that's the one I want to know about, okay.
00:45:15 He's called Iron Bull and yes, I need-
00:45:17 Iron Bull?
00:45:18 Oh, damn.
00:45:20 That's hot.
00:45:21 Now I need to come go back to my game
00:45:25 because I remember I made a character
00:45:27 specifically to romance that guy, so.
00:45:30 Now we're talking.
00:45:32 Yeah.
00:45:33 Nate did too.
00:45:34 It's called Nate Bestman.
00:45:35 Yeah, I'm sure.
00:45:36 I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna,
00:45:38 if he was originally, I was going to originally romance him,
00:45:41 but then Colin happened and oh, my heart.
00:45:44 Because of the story this guy has had
00:45:46 throughout the whole games, like in the original game,
00:45:48 I played as a female mage and you meet him.
00:45:52 And he has a crush on you in the original game.
00:45:54 And yeah, that's really cute.
00:45:56 And then like you meet him in the second game
00:45:58 and he's sort of like, not exactly an antagonist,
00:46:03 but he, but like if you play a mage,
00:46:04 he's not really happy with mages at that point
00:46:07 for a lot of reasons.
00:46:08 Oh wait, is he that, he's that like Ranger guy
00:46:10 who hates magic and wants to kill everybody, right?
00:46:11 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's-
00:46:13 Does he wear a bandana?
00:46:14 Does he wear a bandana?
00:46:15 No, he has fluffy feather things.
00:46:18 Like he's like a captain of stuff.
00:46:20 Anywho.
00:46:21 So yeah, so the Ranger guy is a DLC character
00:46:24 which I never got because I dislike him severely
00:46:27 and he messes up my game.
00:46:30 At least how I want to play it
00:46:31 because I want people to be as happy as possible
00:46:34 and he just kind of nopes out
00:46:37 of one of the endings of the game.
00:46:38 And like he forces me to make a choice
00:46:41 that I don't want to choose.
00:46:42 That I don't want to make-
00:46:43 What does he make you choose?
00:46:44 What's the choice?
00:46:46 Either kill one of my party members-
00:46:47 Straight or gay?
00:46:48 No, no, no, either kill one of my party members
00:46:50 or like he gets the fuck out or something like that.
00:46:53 I don't remember.
00:46:54 Like he really advocates for the killing
00:46:56 of one of my party members.
00:46:57 And I'm like, no, I like this party member
00:46:59 despite all the fuck that shit he's done.
00:47:02 So.
00:47:02 Okay.
00:47:03 Anywho, so yeah, so like Cullen and the second me
00:47:05 and then the third game he's finally romance-able
00:47:07 and I was like, I've been playing female majors
00:47:09 throughout all these games.
00:47:10 Wouldn't it be so cool if he could finally
00:47:12 get it on with like a female age?
00:47:16 Isn't that how it was with Tali?
00:47:17 You could only romance her in Mass Effect 3 as well
00:47:19 or something.
00:47:20 I never romance her.
00:47:21 You could romance her in Mass Effect 2.
00:47:22 It was the first game that you could-
00:47:25 I got you.
00:47:26 Yes.
00:47:27 Mass Effect's another good example of that.
00:47:29 It was kind of different because like Mass Effect 2
00:47:32 was way different than Mass Effect 1
00:47:34 but people were generally positive towards it.
00:47:37 Like there was like a hardcore group of people
00:47:38 who played Mass Effect 1 who weren't a big fan of it
00:47:41 because like Mass Effect 1 was a role-playing game.
00:47:44 The combat was pretty bare bones
00:47:47 but like there was like loot and gear
00:47:49 and like everything you killed, you had drops
00:47:51 and like you could change your armor
00:47:52 and change like all your equipment and stuff
00:47:54 and like it reflected things like one of the big memes
00:47:56 of Mass Effect 1 is you could dress everybody
00:47:57 in pink armor and it looked ridiculous
00:47:59 because like there were pink armor sets
00:48:00 that just were really good.
00:48:02 Like the designs were really fucking weird
00:48:04 but then Mass Effect 2, they changed all of that
00:48:06 and it became strictly a shooter with RPG elements
00:48:09 and the combat got a lot tighter
00:48:12 and it was much more fun to actually like have firefights
00:48:15 and stuff which became much more the focus of the game
00:48:17 but there were only a couple armor sets
00:48:20 and they weren't like equipment, it was just kind of like
00:48:23 rewards you got throughout playing the game.
00:48:24 So like everything, all the RPG stuff
00:48:26 was like very streamlined or stripped out entirely
00:48:28 in favor of being a shooter
00:48:30 with a light leveling progression.
00:48:32 Well, you know, I still wanna make my point.
00:48:35 So Dragon Age 2.
00:48:36 Wait, so let me just finish, I just wanna say on this,
00:48:37 it's just that what's interesting about Mass Effect
00:48:39 is just that like that, so that was always intended
00:48:41 to have a sequel but like obviously the reboots,
00:48:43 like that's another story with the Andromeda and whatnot.
00:48:46 Okay, I'm sorry.
00:48:47 Yeah, I mean Dragon Age also I think, you know,
00:48:49 they also, it's made to have sequels
00:48:51 but yeah, Dragon Age 2, like it got bashed to the ground
00:48:54 and people really disliked it.
00:48:55 However, I think like if it wasn't tied to the franchise
00:48:58 and had come out of its own thing,
00:49:01 people would have been as harsh to it as they were.
00:49:06 It probably wasn't-
00:49:07 But that harshness though, like would it have gotten
00:49:09 as many sales, you know, like would people pay attention?
00:49:12 Like I think the reason they're mad
00:49:13 is because they have an expectation
00:49:15 and then they get tricked, you know.
00:49:17 When you buy into a franchise, like a franchise,
00:49:19 the reason a franchise even can exist
00:49:22 is because it's formed some sort of identity
00:49:24 and expectation in people's minds.
00:49:26 So when you say we're going to make more of this,
00:49:28 they expect more of this,
00:49:30 not like something different with the same name.
00:49:32 And because of Dragon Age,
00:49:34 because they're trying to tell a story
00:49:35 throughout multiple games, like it's all said
00:49:37 within the same time span kind of mode, like generally.
00:49:42 You can see recurring characters, whatnot.
00:49:45 You usually don't, you can't make like an RPG game
00:49:49 into like a first person shooter
00:49:50 and then just so seamlessly and tell, you know,
00:49:53 a story I don't think,
00:49:55 because the fans of the original ones,
00:49:57 like the, that were fans of the RPG part,
00:49:59 I'm probably not going to want to play it
00:50:01 as a first person shooter, you know?
00:50:03 So you can't make too much drastic changes to the formula.
00:50:09 However, you can try to update it and stuff.
00:50:11 And I think with Dragon Age II,
00:50:13 I liked the agreed to the combat,
00:50:15 at least as playing as a mage.
00:50:18 I'll say that much because I haven't played any other classes
00:50:20 because I only play mage, but yeah.
00:50:23 Mage only plays mages, no.
00:50:25 Yeah, so they made the,
00:50:28 like I really liked the combat as a mage in Dragon Age II,
00:50:31 which I think was a nice upgrade
00:50:32 because in the first one, it just,
00:50:34 it felt really clunky and the animation was sort of like,
00:50:37 I'm poking someone with a stick just for like,
00:50:39 with a distance, like very big distance.
00:50:41 Like I poke someone with a stick
00:50:43 and then like a lightning bolt comes out
00:50:45 and then like hits them and just like,
00:50:47 it just like, it looked like my character was going like,
00:50:50 nyeh, nyeh, it's just so silly.
00:50:53 And so unsatisfying because like Dragon Age II,
00:50:57 they kind of like combined like martial arts with the staff.
00:51:00 So you can do like really cool moves.
00:51:02 So like you switched staff around and like,
00:51:05 Is this in first person?
00:51:06 Is this in first person?
00:51:07 No, it's a third person.
00:51:08 Oh, okay.
00:51:09 I'm just trying to get a picture of what's happening here.
00:51:11 It's like, it's like, it's a lot more satisfying the combat.
00:51:15 And like when you melee people within like range as a mage,
00:51:20 even that looks cool.
00:51:22 Even if you don't do that much damage, like it's,
00:51:25 it's really neat.
00:51:25 I liked, I liked it to the combat a lot.
00:51:29 Okay. So, so basically,
00:51:30 so not every franchise immediately goes to shit.
00:51:33 I like, and there's things to be enjoyed.
00:51:35 Well, here's, here's my question.
00:51:36 I'll just quickly want to say like,
00:51:37 Dragon Age Inquisition was the third game
00:51:40 and I think it was received positively enough.
00:51:44 They did a lot of changes that people heavily disliked
00:51:46 because they sort of made it feel like an MMORPG
00:51:50 with a lot of little mini quests and very big worlds
00:51:54 that kind of felt a little bit on the empty side
00:51:56 and just like a lot of little tedious quests here and there,
00:51:59 you know, pick up five herbs, kill 10 boys or something,
00:52:02 you know, those sort of quests
00:52:04 to make it feel more bloated than it actually is.
00:52:07 However, I didn't, it wasn't a deal breaker for me.
00:52:11 I didn't have too much of a problem
00:52:13 because I'm a great big MMORPG junky sort of person.
00:52:18 So I didn't have an issue with that.
00:52:21 It didn't, I liked the game regardless
00:52:23 and it's my favorite game of the three.
00:52:26 And I hope they do better with the next game.
00:52:29 And I'm really scared
00:52:30 because the EA has been fucking up recently and...
00:52:33 Oof.
00:52:34 Have you considered being a video game YouTuber?
00:52:39 No.
00:52:40 I mean, I sort of like, I did an Undertale Let's Play
00:52:43 that I never finished, but no, I don't wanna.
00:52:47 I'm not, I'm not, no.
00:52:49 I'm a wee, you know, so many things.
00:52:51 So just get that out on the PCP.
00:52:53 Yes.
00:52:54 In the middle of every PCP with Mage,
00:52:55 we'll not have a game review, just out of nowhere.
00:52:58 I don't play that many games that I don't know.
00:53:01 Like I usually play like very cute farming sims
00:53:05 or something like that.
00:53:07 Well, okay.
00:53:09 I mean, I'm trying to come to like a thoughtful thing
00:53:13 to say, to summarize.
00:53:15 Like, okay, is it fair to say that franchises
00:53:18 are always bad?
00:53:20 No, right.
00:53:21 It should never happen.
00:53:22 He's what I can say about things.
00:53:25 No, Mage, pause.
00:53:26 Give talk, god damn it.
00:53:27 Franchises.
00:53:28 I was fucking pausing.
00:53:32 You, then you interrupted.
00:53:33 Also you went on about your shit for a while, Nate.
00:53:36 I waited a long time.
00:53:37 You're absolutely right.
00:53:38 You're absolutely right.
00:53:40 What we need to do is to stop giving a shit
00:53:44 about the names of franchises
00:53:46 and start giving a shit about the people behind them.
00:53:49 It's always the case.
00:53:51 It just always is.
00:53:53 Even sometimes when it isn't the case, it's the case.
00:53:56 We should literally criminalize naming movies.
00:53:59 We should name them one, two, three,
00:54:00 starting with the first movie we made now
00:54:02 and just naming them with numbers forever.
00:54:04 The artist behind the thing is so much more
00:54:08 of a reliable way to tell whether a game is going to be
00:54:15 the sort of thing that you want from a franchise.
00:54:18 The most obvious example is Dark Souls 2
00:54:21 in the Dark Demon Blood franchise
00:54:23 was not helmed by a hit attacker Miyazaki
00:54:27 like the other games.
00:54:29 And it's not as good in various ways
00:54:31 that it was good in the other games.
00:54:33 That's a great point.
00:54:34 He directed all the other ones.
00:54:37 And it's clear that he has a very clear vision
00:54:40 of what the game should have in them
00:54:42 and why things are put there.
00:54:45 And so when he's in charge, you can tell before you buy
00:54:51 that at least there's going to be a good shit.
00:54:55 I was upset with Dark Souls 2,
00:54:58 but then hit attacker Miyazaki
00:55:00 coming back for Dark Souls 3.
00:55:02 I was like, OK.
00:55:02 I was like, OK.
00:55:03 Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:55:04 He made Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3.
00:55:06 And I'm like, OK, this time I've never
00:55:09 liked the idea of believing something
00:55:12 is going to be good before reviews come out.
00:55:15 I never liked pre-ordering.
00:55:16 Pre-ordering is stupid.
00:55:18 But and I didn't pre-order Dark Souls 3.
00:55:21 But I had this idea that if he's there,
00:55:24 I feel like it's going to be good.
00:55:25 And it was.
00:55:26 Like fucking, oh, shit.
00:55:29 I just had like the godfather.
00:55:32 Everyone, the Godfather 2 actually won more Oscars
00:55:34 than Godfather 1, I think.
00:55:36 And that was just another by Coppola, you know?
00:55:38 Like if that had been outsourced, like, for example,
00:55:40 I forget who the director was of American Beauty.
00:55:43 Like American Beauty 1 is like a legendary film
00:55:45 that everybody loves, Dubs.
00:55:47 But then America, I mean, this may be a bad example,
00:55:50 but American Beauty 2, it is a sequel.
00:55:53 It features the character in a small way.
00:55:55 I have not seen it.
00:55:56 It stars Mila Kunis and it's like, it's like a joke.
00:56:00 Like it's a, no, it's just not real.
00:56:03 Like if you bought American Psycho 1,
00:56:06 I knew it was a video game,
00:56:07 and then you bought American Psycho 2, I mean, no, it's not.
00:56:11 There's an American Psycho 2?
00:56:13 There is, starring Mila Kunis as, I mean,
00:56:16 but that's so bad.
00:56:17 You said American Beauty.
00:56:19 God damn it, American Psycho, no beauty involved here.
00:56:22 Okay, I was very confused.
00:56:23 Except for Person Fail, if you know what I'm saying.
00:56:26 Got him, hashtag gay.
00:56:28 Yeah, there was another, oh, I was gonna say,
00:56:30 and another one is like Hideki Kamiya directed
00:56:35 like Devil May Cry 1,
00:56:36 but then like Devil May Cry 2 was by some other asshole
00:56:39 and it was a complete nightmare.
00:56:40 It was terrible and this was young me before I knew.
00:56:43 I think that's, yeah, yeah.
00:56:44 I think that same guy also went on to make
00:56:47 Devil May Cry 3 and like redeemed himself, I think.
00:56:49 I think that's what happened.
00:56:50 Yeah, I thought that Kamiya came back for 3
00:56:53 and then someone called me up on a previous episode
00:56:55 and was like, no, you're fucking retarded.
00:56:57 It was the same guy who just like learned to not suck.
00:56:59 And I was like, oh, well, I take back all the things
00:57:02 that I said for him for like 15 years.
00:57:03 It's not a guarantee, that's true.
00:57:04 It's not a guarantee if the same guy is,
00:57:06 but it's more reliable than seeing the brand's name
00:57:10 or even seeing the company behind it
00:57:12 or like the publisher or the game studio or the,
00:57:15 you know, the team.
00:57:18 I mean, sometimes the team is just,
00:57:21 it's not the same team, even if it's all the same people,
00:57:24 if it's been like three decades, like with Ukulele,
00:57:28 most of the old gang came back and it sucks.
00:57:33 And it's just because they weren't doing that,
00:57:37 that whole thing for so many years that they had changed
00:57:40 and they didn't know what they were doing as much anymore.
00:57:42 Yeah, that's a good point.
00:57:44 Like, go ahead, Mitch.
00:57:46 I wanna say, so we can sort of like agree
00:57:48 that like the things, like criticizing things
00:57:53 just because they're different from how they used to be
00:57:55 isn't really a good sort of basis to criticize things,
00:57:58 but it is okay to criticize things for actual faults
00:58:03 that things have.
00:58:05 So like, basically just take your nostalgia goggles off
00:58:07 if you wanna criticize new games
00:58:09 because you have to consider like,
00:58:12 are they good on their own, you know?
00:58:15 Like your games-
00:58:16 That's definitely true.
00:58:16 Yeah, I mean, a lot of people, they don't do that
00:58:19 because they're judging it based on the idea
00:58:22 that they want a new version of this franchise
00:58:25 and that is what they're being sold,
00:58:26 but they're not getting it because it's different.
00:58:28 And that cuts both ways though.
00:58:29 Like some people, because they played the old thing,
00:58:32 will be more critical.
00:58:33 I think that's most of us here,
00:58:34 but then other people have like a rose colored
00:58:36 nostalgia glasses and like they'll see
00:58:38 the Final Fantasy VII remake and like I grew up,
00:58:41 myself saying this and my friends saying,
00:58:43 whatever console Final Fantasy VII remake
00:58:47 eventually comes out on, I will buy.
00:58:49 And this was like more than a decade ago
00:58:51 that me and my friends were like saying this shit
00:58:53 because like this, like obviously
00:58:55 it's going to be the best game ever,
00:58:57 but of course we didn't know
00:58:58 that like the compilation was coming, man,
00:59:00 the compilation and like,
00:59:01 and there were all these directorial issues,
00:59:03 like the game isn't being worked on
00:59:04 and like all these problems are happening in development.
00:59:07 And most people still don't,
00:59:09 most people don't like fucking, you know,
00:59:11 follow gaming press and dev logs and all this crazy shit.
00:59:14 So like they're not gonna know.
00:59:15 They're just gonna be like,
00:59:16 oh, I remember Final Fantasy VII and they're making it again.
00:59:19 I think this is the problem
00:59:20 and there's literally nothing we can do about it
00:59:22 except possibly advocate that people change their mindset,
00:59:25 but I think it's not going to happen.
00:59:26 The problem is that people stop
00:59:29 when they see the name of a thing
00:59:31 and like the company behind it possibly,
00:59:33 even that is probably too much.
00:59:35 They just see like new Marvel movie
00:59:37 and they think, okay, gonna be great.
00:59:39 Or, you know, or like new Final Fantasy game,
00:59:41 okay, it's gonna be great, new Kingdom Hearts,
00:59:43 okay, it's gonna be great.
00:59:44 But what they need to do is investigate
00:59:46 who's directing it, what have they done recently?
00:59:50 What is the team developing?
00:59:52 It's a bit much to ask that people do that for everything.
00:59:54 But that's why we YouTubers
00:59:55 can bring them that information, you know?
00:59:57 I think that the most I can do specifically
01:00:01 to quell this problem is just to be like,
01:00:04 I don't even know his name.
01:00:05 The guy who made Calvin and Hobbes,
01:00:07 he's a genius and he's a school.
01:00:08 George Harrison.
01:00:09 George Harrison.
01:00:11 That's the-
01:00:12 Bill Lauderson, you fucking fools.
01:00:14 Don't sully his name.
01:00:15 The greatest human I've ever lived.
01:00:17 All I can do is when an if, no, when,
01:00:22 I make a big, giant franchise, like big thing,
01:00:26 like, oh, everybody wants to make a movie of my thing.
01:00:29 I'm gonna say no, and I'm gonna write my will, fuck you.
01:00:32 Nobody will ever touch anything I make
01:00:34 and they'll be great as a result.
01:00:36 That's what I want, man.
01:00:38 That's what I want.
01:00:38 I didn't wanna say the-
01:00:39 I made it if you were gonna say.
01:00:41 It's okay to sort of like, you know,
01:00:42 have initial dislike or like of a thing to reaction.
01:00:45 Like, you can't control your emotions to a thing.
01:00:48 Like, so you might have a knee-jerk reaction.
01:00:50 But if you're gonna like,
01:00:52 don't go and pick fights with people
01:00:54 over your silly emotions
01:00:56 and just like, think a little bit before you do that.
01:00:58 I mean, I totally hear you on the image,
01:01:00 but like, what I'm advocating for
01:01:02 is a severe and massive amount of rage
01:01:05 if you have a well-researched opinion at like, for example,
01:01:09 my feelings on the Final Fantasy VII remake.
01:01:11 I feel like I know the score.
01:01:12 I have done the research.
01:01:15 And again, I know likely what issues are to be.
01:01:17 So I will continue to raise these concerns.
01:01:19 But however, when the game is finally before me,
01:01:22 I will drop all of that as best I can
01:01:24 and attempt to give it a sincere, thorough, clean slate.
01:01:27 And you will buy the collector's edition.
01:01:28 He'll get the cool cloud statue
01:01:30 and he will fucking do it all.
01:01:32 I think something really important
01:01:33 when looking at franchises and remakes and stuff
01:01:36 is that there's a difference.
01:01:37 You have to understand yourself.
01:01:39 There is a difference between saying,
01:01:41 I don't like this because it's not what I wanted it to be.
01:01:44 And this thing is terrible and I hate it
01:01:46 because it's possible for something to be really, really good
01:01:49 but just not at all what you wanted.
01:01:50 That was what happened with me when Kill La Kill came out.
01:01:53 Like, I just had the wrong expectation.
01:01:54 I went in thinking like, you're in login too, here we go.
01:01:57 I did the exact same thing.
01:01:58 That was a huge mistake.
01:01:59 Yeah, I didn't have that explanation.
01:02:00 I quite liked it.
01:02:01 The reason that happened is because they advertise it
01:02:03 as like another Gurren login.
01:02:05 If you watch all of the previews and stuff.
01:02:07 I mean, I accept responsibility for misreading it,
01:02:10 but yeah, I mean.
01:02:11 At the end of the day, I've never seen a Gurren login.
01:02:13 Oh my God!
01:02:15 Well, well, good luck.
01:02:16 I watched one episode, it's not for me, it's not for me.
01:02:20 Oh, oh, oh, do we have to, all right, all right.
01:02:23 Everybody, we have to disconnect mage,
01:02:25 we have to hold hold vote right now.
01:02:26 Kick mage, yes or no?
01:02:27 How you can't?
01:02:31 Well, how interesting.
01:02:32 So you watched episode one and just didn't like it?
01:02:34 Yeah, I think I watched like two or maybe two episodes.
01:02:37 Go watch, go watch this anime ever, Gurren login part,
01:02:40 one and two.
01:02:41 I don't, I don't wanna, you can't,
01:02:43 the more you force me, the less likely I'll be to watch it.
01:02:46 I'm not forcing anybody, blame Tom, it's not me.
01:02:49 Yeah, stop nagging.
01:02:50 No, oh no, I'm so sad.
01:02:52 Don't be like everyone's mother.
01:02:54 I'm so sad now, I have to be mage's mom on this.
01:02:57 You know what's funny, Tom is like almost as big a fan
01:02:59 of Gurren login as I am, I mean, you know,
01:03:01 maybe not as intellectual, an analyzer of a fucking anime.
01:03:07 You like it with your brain, I like it with my heart,
01:03:09 okay, Mr. Gurren?
01:03:10 Remember when I was, yeah, yeah, sure.
01:03:12 When I was working on that video,
01:03:13 I remember discussing it with you,
01:03:15 like the thought of possibly getting you involved.
01:03:17 I mean, it just didn't work out that way,
01:03:18 but I remember that came out,
01:03:20 that was like four, three years ago,
01:03:21 it was something.
01:03:22 It was a long time.
01:03:23 Yeah, yeah.
01:03:24 I remember Ghost in the Shell coming next, man,
01:03:26 I can't wait for Nate to release his third video.
01:03:28 I know, right?
01:03:29 I know, right?
01:03:30 I like the memes, though, I'm aware of it.
01:03:35 The memes are good, all good.
01:03:38 That's pretty good, right?
01:03:40 I don't know, weaponized thickness,
01:03:41 not from that video, but, you know.
01:03:44 All right, team.
01:03:45 I think we've, I'm actually pretty happy
01:03:48 with where we've arrived with this.
01:03:49 That was a pretty decent summary.
01:03:51 The issue is just, you gotta do research,
01:03:53 and the problem is that no one ever will,
01:03:55 like the problem is that the dummies of the world
01:03:58 who don't know anything, they see like, you know,
01:04:02 it's Marvel, baby, and they're like,
01:04:04 yeah, I will get my mind to this uncritically
01:04:07 and have no, you know, whatever.
01:04:09 Just a quick disclaimer to people who,
01:04:12 like, because we namedropped a lot of games,
01:04:14 and there might be people who are like,
01:04:16 oh, you like this game, but there were like these faults
01:04:19 in it, or like, oh, you dislike this game,
01:04:20 but like, it has these and these good things.
01:04:22 Like, this is not a game review podcast,
01:04:24 so we can't go in-depth about all the things
01:04:26 good and bad about games.
01:04:28 If you like any video game viewer,
01:04:30 you are a fucking idiot piece of shit, loser,
01:04:32 and literally delete yourself from real life.
01:04:34 And basically, if we let something out,
01:04:36 it's not because we're ignorant, it's just like,
01:04:39 we had to move on, especially me and Nate,
01:04:41 we talked a lot.
01:04:43 That's, sure, sure.
01:04:46 Yep, that's true.
01:04:48 All right, I think we're done here.
01:04:51 Gib, Tom, any final thoughts on this?
01:04:53 Thanks, everybody, for listening to the 108th episode
01:04:57 of the Procrastinators franchise.
01:04:58 That's right.
01:05:00 I look forward to getting to 180,
01:05:02 so we can do a 180 degree change
01:05:04 to do something completely different
01:05:05 from the PCP up to this point.
01:05:07 That'd be very funny.
01:05:08 Like, upload, that would be a great idea.
01:05:10 It's dead now, we killed it.
01:05:13 That'll be great, that'll be great.
01:05:14 Gib, any thoughts, any final thoughts here?
01:05:16 Oh, we should pretend to be each other on the 180th.
01:05:18 You're not Gib.
01:05:20 Whoa.
01:05:22 No, there are no more thoughts.
01:05:24 Zero.
01:05:25 I am out of thoughts.
01:05:26 There's nothing left in my brain.
01:05:27 No more simple thoughts, they're done.
01:05:30 Yes.
01:05:31 All right, well, all right, it's time to switch on gears
01:05:34 over here to our hashtag ask PCP section, everybody.
01:05:38 I, on the Twitter, I use hashtag ask PCP every Saturday
01:05:41 when we record, I send out a tweet,
01:05:43 if you, well, don't respond to it,
01:05:44 but you just send a thing with hashtag ask PCP.
01:05:47 You'll see it, you'll see it.
01:05:49 All right, I just want to give a shout out
01:05:51 to this guy, Cult of the Yellow One.
01:05:53 Someone's been continually asking about, like,
01:05:56 our stances on gun control,
01:05:58 and I think it's this guy, like, every time.
01:06:00 It's just like, I don't know,
01:06:01 I don't want to get into that shit.
01:06:03 I have no fucking idea what the right,
01:06:05 I'm just saying, like, I don't know.
01:06:08 Every baby should have a gun,
01:06:09 but anyone over the age of two should be killed.
01:06:17 I have no complaints.
01:06:20 I'm satisfied by that answer.
01:06:22 Wait a minute, oh, here's actually a relevant question.
01:06:24 It's at discount Picasso asks,
01:06:27 are normies the root cause of all problems with art?
01:06:31 I think that really sums up.
01:06:32 I mean, what we covered in this podcast.
01:06:34 That pretty much sums it up,
01:06:35 because, like, the people who don't care
01:06:38 determine they're the vast majority,
01:06:40 the vast majority of people don't care,
01:06:41 and the vast majority of people control
01:06:43 the market conditions,
01:06:44 and market conditions are responsible
01:06:46 for all major decisions,
01:06:47 because all major decisions are based on money and not art.
01:06:50 Mm, there you go.
01:06:51 Yeah, that's, and I don't see that changing
01:06:53 until we become a post-scarcity society,
01:06:56 which may never happen.
01:06:57 I mean, we don't need to be a coma post-scarcity,
01:06:59 we just need to have a lot of money to be like,
01:07:02 I'll just give this strange artist like those.
01:07:04 Or if we just have everybody after two years old be killed,
01:07:07 there are no more normies anymore.
01:07:08 I mean, that'll fix this problem right now.
01:07:11 But the reason I don't agree with that, Gabe,
01:07:13 is because as long as money has any influence,
01:07:15 people will always want as much money as possible.
01:07:19 So I think as long, and like,
01:07:20 cause that equates to power.
01:07:21 No, but like, like, the,
01:07:23 there's like times in before big money crashes
01:07:27 and bank collapses and whatever,
01:07:29 more weird art was being funded
01:07:32 because people were like, yeah, sure.
01:07:34 You know, there's money to go around,
01:07:36 there's jobs for you to have.
01:07:37 We don't, it's not a big deal.
01:07:39 We'll give this strange artist some funding.
01:07:42 I agree.
01:07:43 But now you have to be a giant super world
01:07:47 dominating franchise or you're gone.
01:07:50 I think the question though is less about
01:07:52 like what art is being made
01:07:54 and more about what art is being supported.
01:07:57 Cause like, even now you can make whatever you want
01:07:59 on the internet or whatever,
01:08:00 the normies aren't always gonna do the normie thing.
01:08:02 You know?
01:08:03 And that's the problem.
01:08:04 Yeah, that's right.
01:08:05 Whatever's popular, it's just whatever's popular.
01:08:07 Even if a studio threw a huge like budget
01:08:09 behind like some crazy art film,
01:08:11 like people are gonna be like, yeah,
01:08:12 but Avengers 12 dude, and they'll just go watch that.
01:08:16 Yeah, I mean, that's, yeah.
01:08:18 There's a real consolidation of entertainment.
01:08:20 Honestly, just behind Disney.
01:08:21 Like Disney's just buying everything.
01:08:23 I mean, if things are being funded,
01:08:25 that's the main, if things exist, that's the main thing.
01:08:27 It's not about whether you can convince
01:08:30 the majority of people that your weird art thing is good.
01:08:32 Well, what would you say to this though?
01:08:34 Like let's say that...
01:08:35 It's that the artist is allowed to express themselves
01:08:37 in the way that you are.
01:08:38 Okay, here's a real question though.
01:08:39 And this is kind of a separate thing,
01:08:40 but it's like, if, so let's say that like,
01:08:42 there's enough money to go around for whatever reason,
01:08:44 like we've got fucking, you know,
01:08:45 universal basic income or whatever,
01:08:47 where like everyone can make their art.
01:08:49 But the thing is though,
01:08:50 like there's so much market share dominance
01:08:53 by like mainstream things like Avengers movies
01:08:55 and you know, just like all the like normie stuff
01:08:59 is so pop up that it like on social media,
01:09:01 which is how people communicate,
01:09:02 it just like drowns out that.
01:09:04 So like all audiences are like,
01:09:06 like there's always gonna be a couple people
01:09:08 who are into your shit,
01:09:09 but like the vast, vast majority of people,
01:09:12 which I guess is actually true right now,
01:09:13 are just like inundated with like, you know, Marvel
01:09:16 and you know, like the new, I guess, Final Fantasy,
01:09:19 even just like the AAA stuff,
01:09:20 new Uncharted or whatever.
01:09:22 And they don't like pay attention to the small things.
01:09:26 I don't know, do you think that's like,
01:09:27 I personally fear as things kind of like power seems
01:09:31 like it's getting consolidated online these days,
01:09:33 that things could end up in a place where like,
01:09:35 just through a lack of ability to compete
01:09:38 with the market share and like the budgeting,
01:09:40 the advertising campaigns of like big Disney stuff,
01:09:44 that like it'll really drown out people
01:09:46 and they'll, you know, do bad.
01:09:49 They won't get the word out about their stuff.
01:09:53 Any thoughts?
01:09:53 I mean, that's how it's always been.
01:09:55 That is true, that is true.
01:09:57 It's all marketing.
01:09:58 I mean, that's the whole thing.
01:09:59 That's why a lot of mediocre shit does so well.
01:10:02 I want the world to be like,
01:10:05 every man like is by his own strength and will
01:10:09 can like break through and become, you know,
01:10:13 like king of his own castle
01:10:14 and acquire his own little domain or whatever way,
01:10:17 as opposed to, and I don't know if that's realistic
01:10:19 I feel like the reason then,
01:10:21 there's clearly a reason that normies don't like weird shit
01:10:25 and it's like the weird shit only appeals
01:10:27 to a very specific mindset
01:10:29 and only a certain amount of people have that.
01:10:32 So even if everything that's weird gets funded,
01:10:34 it won't be that important for most people
01:10:37 that it gets funded.
01:10:38 That's true.
01:10:39 It's the same thing.
01:10:40 Not everybody has the capacity to build their own castle.
01:10:44 Some people just be the vassal
01:10:46 and that's just the way they are.
01:10:48 Yeah, fair point, fair point.
01:10:51 So that's why you have to get to the top,
01:10:53 have all the money and abuse all those stupid people.
01:10:55 And that's what Comcast did
01:10:56 and look how good they're doing.
01:10:59 They're doing pretty damn well.
01:11:00 Pretty fucking damn well.
01:11:01 Did you hear they made a cash bid for Fox
01:11:03 trying to take the rug out from under Disney?
01:11:06 Oh, I didn't hear about that, damn.
01:11:08 Yeah, they're gonna have like $60 billion.
01:11:10 I'm gonna straight up here you go
01:11:11 and they want to steal Fox from Disney.
01:11:13 That's their big deal.
01:11:14 Damn, okay, okay.
01:11:16 Think about this though, everybody.
01:11:17 Imagine like your internet and TV service provider
01:11:20 also owns the entertainment company that makes the art
01:11:24 that they distribute.
01:11:24 They own like TriStar and like they own Coca-Cola
01:11:26 and a bunch of crazy shit.
01:11:27 Huh, I'm sure that doesn't cause any problems at all.
01:11:29 I'm sure that doesn't influence
01:11:31 like the stuff they create whatsoever.
01:11:32 I'm sure I'm not gonna see Coca-Cola ads
01:11:34 in front of every movie ever
01:11:35 since like the late, the mid 90s.
01:11:37 Oh wait, I do.
01:11:39 Yeah, it's pretty fucked up.
01:11:42 Hey, here's an interesting-
01:11:42 Watch the Jack and Jill Red Letter Media review, everybody.
01:11:44 Oh, I love that.
01:11:45 That's one of the best.
01:11:46 Hey, look, here's a good question.
01:11:48 This is my hashtag down with Ben St.
01:11:50 Oh.
01:11:51 And this is in the page.
01:11:52 It's a hashtag I can get by.
01:11:54 The thing is, I think actually a bunch of people
01:11:56 are using hashtag Ben St.
01:11:57 So I'm just gonna, I clicked on this thing.
01:11:58 It says center, I think this is center point.
01:12:00 I think this name is center point.
01:12:02 Is that the name before?
01:12:03 Yeah, I think he pledged it like the RideCon fund and stuff.
01:12:07 But anyway, I believe it's center point.
01:12:09 And his question is,
01:12:10 if you guys could get a sponsor for the podcast
01:12:12 in exchange for slightly censoring yourself
01:12:16 like bleeping the word nigger, would you do it?
01:12:19 Would you do it?
01:12:20 Cause I'm curious what you guys think.
01:12:22 Cause I've always had a deep personal aversion
01:12:24 to the idea of like getting a known sponsor.
01:12:27 It's just-
01:12:28 I never say the word anyway so it doesn't matter to me.
01:12:31 That's true, that's true.
01:12:32 I'm not against sponsorship deals
01:12:34 because the, you can, like Game Grumps has shown
01:12:38 you can make them really funny
01:12:39 to the point where I don't care at all.
01:12:41 Those are, yeah, I like that.
01:12:42 Here's the thing, here's the thing for me.
01:12:44 In that specific example,
01:12:46 it would A, dependent on how much money it is.
01:12:48 But if it was enough money to make it lucrative,
01:12:51 I think that that specific censorship
01:12:53 would have no artistic impact on the show itself.
01:12:56 I think it would be funnier to bleep out certain words
01:12:59 like that because-
01:13:00 I mean, let's just say-
01:13:01 Okay, go ahead, go ahead.
01:13:02 But like if the deal was like,
01:13:04 these are like certain topics or things you can't go into.
01:13:06 Like if it was like legitimate like censorship,
01:13:09 I'd be like, no, like fuck that.
01:13:10 Like nothing's worth that.
01:13:11 Cause then like the entire time,
01:13:14 because even if you never like,
01:13:16 even go near those grounds,
01:13:17 the entire time in the back of your head,
01:13:19 every time we record from now to the end of the time,
01:13:21 we'll always constantly be thinking about not doing that.
01:13:24 And then like 10% of our brain CPU is gonna be dedicated
01:13:27 to making sure we don't go somewhere.
01:13:28 And it'll just make the product worse.
01:13:31 That's true.
01:13:31 I'm okay with bleeping swears
01:13:33 because a lot of the time bleeps are funnier.
01:13:35 Bleeps are funnier than saying swears.
01:13:37 That is definitely true.
01:13:39 I don't know, people don't agree with me on this.
01:13:42 I'm glad that you do.
01:13:44 Listen to something back everybody.
01:13:45 Bleeps are literally way funnier
01:13:47 than just leaving in an actual swear.
01:13:49 I don't know why.
01:13:50 I like the idea of like having different bleeps every time.
01:13:53 Like a different noise.
01:13:54 Like I don't know, like a jackhammer or like,
01:13:57 I don't know, like a siren or something that I...
01:13:59 The whole podcast is just that one episode of SpongeBob,
01:14:01 where they all swear.
01:14:02 Wait a minute, I've got it.
01:14:04 What if for each individual swear,
01:14:06 we use a specific type of bleep
01:14:08 so that it's like saying N-word or whatever.
01:14:11 It's like, so they come to associate
01:14:12 that specific noise, whatever it may be,
01:14:14 with the actual word of question.
01:14:16 No, they have to be common sounds
01:14:17 you hear all the time in real life.
01:14:18 So as you're just going around your everyday life,
01:14:20 you just hear swears subconsciously.
01:14:22 This is a great idea, we should do this.
01:14:24 That is a good idea.
01:14:25 We should do a censorship episode where we do that.
01:14:27 That would be awesome.
01:14:29 That would be awesome.
01:14:30 I'll edit that, cause that sounds fun.
01:14:32 It actually does sound fun.
01:14:33 Like that should be, at the very least,
01:14:35 a bonus episode for sure, locked.
01:14:36 Oh, that'd be a great bonus episode.
01:14:38 I wanna be honest, so please don't do it while I'm away.
01:14:41 Well, we've already got one lined up for this month,
01:14:43 so that'll be next month, at the earliest.
01:14:44 Sick, all right, on the post.
01:14:45 Okay, that'd be dope.
01:14:46 But I don't have a microphone, by the way.
01:14:48 I'm gonna take it to Lafayette, so.
01:14:50 Oh, that's dope.
01:14:51 Sick, awesome.
01:14:52 Glad to hear it.
01:14:54 Here's a question from Kajuro Bitterthorn
01:14:57 on the Patreon, asks,
01:14:59 question, I mean, this has a question for Dayton Tom,
01:15:01 but anybody can respond.
01:15:02 How do I abandon my nihilistic hedonism
01:15:04 and embark on the path to becoming a productive boy
01:15:07 that has goals?
01:15:09 How do I convince myself that life will be better
01:15:10 if I haven't achieved goals?
01:15:12 I mean, I've got an answer to this.
01:15:15 Yeah, what do you think, Tom?
01:15:16 Shit, I guess you need to ask,
01:15:20 I think for me, giving you an answer would really depend
01:15:23 on knowing exactly what your current mindset is,
01:15:25 like how you feel about being more hedonistic.
01:15:29 If it feels good and you have no real desire to change,
01:15:32 it's gonna be hard to really,
01:15:33 anything that I would say or suggest to take your heart,
01:15:36 because it has to start with a motivation to change.
01:15:39 I'm going to assume that because you're asking the question
01:15:42 that you have that desire,
01:15:43 and that desire is probably stemming from the fact
01:15:45 that you're sitting around doing nothing long-term
01:15:48 and you feel like shit.
01:15:49 And that's the first step,
01:15:50 is because you have to realize,
01:15:52 like for me, like what I make,
01:15:54 my root source of all my good decisions,
01:15:56 which I'm doing more of lately,
01:15:59 is that like, especially like,
01:16:01 even like a simple example is like dieting,
01:16:03 because my diet's been on point for like three weeks now,
01:16:05 and it's fucking great.
01:16:06 Nice.
01:16:07 And like I just ask myself,
01:16:08 like a really simple question,
01:16:10 like would I enjoy doing this now?
01:16:12 The answer is usually yes,
01:16:13 like going out and ordering a pizza.
01:16:15 The answer is like, will I enjoy this in an hour?
01:16:18 And the answer is always no.
01:16:20 And that's like a really good,
01:16:23 like kind of like stop gap for me,
01:16:25 is just like realizing that like,
01:16:27 instead of thinking like,
01:16:27 oh, I can't wait to have this pizza,
01:16:29 I'm gonna be so happy.
01:16:30 I'm like, the real thing is like,
01:16:31 I can't wait to have this pizza,
01:16:32 I'm gonna be miserable for the rest of the day.
01:16:34 And that's like-
01:16:35 That is a great way to look at it, yeah.
01:16:37 That is a great like way to be like, fuck that.
01:16:39 I'd rather be like stoked later.
01:16:41 And like in like 10 minutes, I'll just be fine.
01:16:44 Like literally 10 minutes, I won't care anymore.
01:16:46 The path to productivity is,
01:16:49 it stems from the realization that suicide's kind of gay.
01:16:56 And why would you-
01:16:58 That's true.
01:16:59 Why though?
01:17:00 I mean-
01:17:00 Like if you're not doing anything,
01:17:02 you're gonna be depressed.
01:17:04 And if you get too depressed,
01:17:05 you think, why am I alive?
01:17:07 And then you think, I'm gonna die.
01:17:08 I'm gonna do it.
01:17:09 But then if you think about it even further,
01:17:11 you realize it's kind of pointless
01:17:13 and who cares, nobody cares.
01:17:15 I think the core of it-
01:17:16 Nobody cares about you, except you.
01:17:17 And if you don't care about you-
01:17:18 It's true, no one's gonna give a shit.
01:17:19 And like the thing is,
01:17:20 is that one of the big things to realize
01:17:22 if you wanna start being more productive,
01:17:24 is understanding that happiness is not the goal,
01:17:27 fulfillment is.
01:17:28 And fulfillment means doing things
01:17:30 that aren't going to make you happy.
01:17:31 Because you need to fill yourself with a sense of purpose
01:17:34 and feel like you are accomplishing something.
01:17:36 That's what gives us a sense of more than just happiness.
01:17:39 Happiness is like eating a pizza and feeling good.
01:17:41 And it's not like you have to find a sense of purpose
01:17:46 before you can do anything.
01:17:47 You have to trick yourself into having one.
01:17:49 Right, if you don't know what your purpose is-
01:17:51 Sure, they could really make it.
01:17:52 If you don't know what your purpose is,
01:17:53 your purpose is try as much shit as possible
01:17:56 until something clicks.
01:17:58 Yeah.
01:17:58 That's step one.
01:18:00 So if like, oh, I don't know what to do.
01:18:02 I don't know if I'm an artist or a viewer guy or anything.
01:18:05 I don't know.
01:18:06 It's like, yeah, you do.
01:18:07 Your goal, your purpose is to find your purpose.
01:18:10 And that's what everybody should be doing until they find it.
01:18:13 Because the only way you find what it is
01:18:14 is by trying a ton of shit.
01:18:16 When my dad, when I was living with my parents
01:18:18 and like looking for work and stuff,
01:18:20 like my dad just said to me like,
01:18:21 Nate, until you get a job, your job,
01:18:23 your eight hour a day job is looking for a job.
01:18:25 And like, that's basically the same sort of thing here.
01:18:28 It's like, yeah, you should be focused
01:18:29 on trying to settle this.
01:18:30 And you know what, you're asking this question.
01:18:32 So off to a great start.
01:18:34 And here's what I would add to that.
01:18:36 Like you're specifically bringing up the idea
01:18:37 of nihilism and hedonism.
01:18:39 And on a certain level, I agree that both of those things
01:18:44 make sense in a way.
01:18:46 But like, okay, like what do you want out of life?
01:18:49 Is the question that you've got to ask yourself.
01:18:51 Like we can accept all the realities that like,
01:18:53 there doesn't seem to be any objective value to life.
01:18:56 Okay, fair enough.
01:18:57 But you're alive.
01:18:58 So why not make the best of it?
01:19:00 You know, and like hedonism.
01:19:01 Like, okay, wouldn't it be nice if we could, in theory,
01:19:04 just like pleasure ourselves at a max rate all the time?
01:19:07 By let's say, you know, just doing heroin.
01:19:10 But okay, would doing heroin every day
01:19:12 actually give me the kind of life that would be the best?
01:19:15 Like, am I going to enjoy having to do an illegal thing
01:19:18 that could get me thrown in jail?
01:19:19 Am I going to enjoy, you know,
01:19:21 having to scrape up money to afford this thing?
01:19:23 And it doesn't have to be that bad obviously.
01:19:25 It could be a symbols ordering a pizza, like Tom said.
01:19:27 Did you want to cut in give?
01:19:28 Do you want to say something?
01:19:30 I just thought like, doing heroin,
01:19:31 doing any drug over and over will reduce
01:19:34 like the impact it has on you.
01:19:35 So you'd need more.
01:19:36 Indeed.
01:19:37 It goes back to being happy now
01:19:39 but it's being happy in an hour.
01:19:40 But you know, what doesn't fade.
01:19:43 But you know what doesn't fade.
01:19:45 I mean, so this is actually how I arrived
01:19:47 at like what I want out of my life.
01:19:49 You know what I want?
01:19:50 I want a big happy family that loves me legitimately.
01:19:53 I want to be financially secure
01:19:55 so I don't need to worry about the world.
01:19:57 And I want to live in an environment
01:19:58 where I, you know, feel good about myself.
01:20:00 I feel good about like my environment.
01:20:03 It gives me positive vibes.
01:20:05 And I want to physically like take care of myself.
01:20:07 So I live as long as possible
01:20:08 and get to enjoy all this stuff.
01:20:10 So like, okay.
01:20:11 Like if you disagree with those approaches
01:20:13 then we're not going to agree.
01:20:14 Like if you think like a good life
01:20:17 is to just feel like, let's say sexual pleasure
01:20:21 as often as possible.
01:20:22 Let's say that's your goal.
01:20:23 Then I would highly recommend
01:20:25 you start investigating how it is.
01:20:27 You can actually like make a plan
01:20:29 to have as much sex as possible.
01:20:30 I mean, maybe the plan for that
01:20:32 is to literally just get a wife who loves sex.
01:20:34 Then you need to like, okay, gotta be able to support her.
01:20:37 Gotta be able to fucking, you know,
01:20:38 like what is your goal in life?
01:20:40 That is where you need to start with this.
01:20:42 You heard mine and that's what I want.
01:20:44 So to get there, I'm doing things like
01:20:46 pursuing careers that make me happy.
01:20:49 You know, like making sure I make enough money
01:20:51 so I don't need to worry about
01:20:52 and have freedom to do what I want to do.
01:20:54 You know, like in my relationship
01:20:56 I try to make sure that I'm happy,
01:20:57 that the other person's happy.
01:20:59 Like all these things are worth thinking about.
01:21:01 And to the point of being a hedonist.
01:21:03 The thing is though, everything I described
01:21:05 sounds like, I don't know, like fucking life coach,
01:21:07 you're like, hedonism's wrong.
01:21:08 I think that like every human is basically just a hedonist.
01:21:12 I'm simply a hedonist who wants to maximize across
01:21:15 like the entire 70, 80, 90, maybe longer years of my life
01:21:19 how happy and enjoyable life is.
01:21:21 And there's a completely rational basis
01:21:23 to do your homework.
01:21:25 Work out several times a week.
01:21:27 Eat healthy and deny yourself sugary foods
01:21:29 that are a fleeting high.
01:21:31 See, it's a fleeting high versus delaying gratification
01:21:34 to live a happier life.
01:21:36 That's where I would start with you.
01:21:38 Think about what you want out of life
01:21:39 and think about how to get there.
01:21:40 That hashtag emotional edging life, you know?
01:21:43 Exactly, that's the one.
01:21:44 I mean, yeah, that's pretty much all I gotta say about it.
01:21:51 Good luck dude, I hope you fucking crush it.
01:21:53 Yeah, Kajuro, crush that puss and crush that dog also
01:21:57 with the opposite of puss, you get it?
01:21:59 Excellent.
01:22:00 Next question, this is a funny one actually.
01:22:03 TamakiXaid asks, what is your most boring passion?
01:22:09 Your most boring passion?
01:22:11 I like that a lot, I like that a lot.
01:22:13 Damn, that's interesting.
01:22:14 Okay, this isn't a passion, but like for example,
01:22:17 I like to count to the number eight repeatedly
01:22:20 throughout the day, and I really enjoy doing it.
01:22:24 That's, yeah, like it's like a text.
01:22:28 Well, it's like when I'm driving,
01:22:31 I'll do it, I'll play a little game with myself
01:22:33 that I'll like, okay, it's gonna be hard to explain,
01:22:35 but like I do a thing where like the telephone poles,
01:22:38 like I try to count my own car lengths
01:22:41 as I drive by them, and I count up to eight
01:22:44 and then I start over, and I like to,
01:22:49 it's really satisfying for me
01:22:51 when my eighth car length lands right before
01:22:54 a final finishing telephone pole
01:22:56 and isn't one of several lengths,
01:22:59 because you can fit like four cars in between telephone poles,
01:23:03 and I do this constantly to myself.
01:23:07 Yeah, that's what I've got, go to hell.
01:23:12 I enjoy it.
01:23:14 Anybody else?
01:23:15 Yeah.
01:23:16 I just wanna think of like a boring passion I have.
01:23:18 Okay, it's just related to Nate's thing.
01:23:21 I also do like a little counting thing in my head.
01:23:24 Whenever I'm waiting for something.
01:23:25 What do you count to?
01:23:26 Yeah, whenever I'm waiting for something,
01:23:28 and like, you know, like let's say
01:23:30 I'm hitting something at the microwave
01:23:32 or like something else, basically it's just,
01:23:37 I count down from six to one, three times.
01:23:44 Wait, I'm sorry, say that one more time.
01:23:47 I'm trying to parse that memory.
01:23:48 But I'm waiting for things.
01:23:49 Let's say I'm hitting something in the microwave
01:23:51 and like I see there's like less than a minute left,
01:23:54 then I start counting in my head, like six, five, four,
01:23:58 and I do it like, when I reach one, I go back to six
01:24:01 and I count down again, I do it three times in total.
01:24:04 The mark of the beast.
01:24:08 That's so appropriate for Mage.
01:24:10 Interesting, now let me, do you do that
01:24:12 as a way to kind of force time to pass
01:24:15 so that when you look back?
01:24:16 Yeah, I totally get that.
01:24:17 I totally get it.
01:24:18 I just felt like that too.
01:24:19 Yeah, it just like, because I'm dragging out the numbers
01:24:23 like six, five, it sounds like I'm counting seconds,
01:24:28 but like each second takes like five seconds to count,
01:24:31 you know, so like.
01:24:32 That makes sense, makes sense.
01:24:34 You know what I do, when I'm on the treadmill at the gym,
01:24:37 like, and I see that there's like a minute left,
01:24:39 that's when I like really start to like,
01:24:41 I try to really forcibly distract myself,
01:24:43 like hardcore from not paying attention
01:24:45 to like what I'm doing or the, you know, pain.
01:24:47 It's not really pain, but like the pain of running.
01:24:49 And then like, when I look back,
01:24:50 I'm like, yes, 10 seconds have passed
01:24:52 and I keep forcing myself to like be distracted by things.
01:24:56 It really only works in that last minute,
01:24:58 because like, I try to do it when I'm like running
01:25:01 for like long-term things and like distract myself
01:25:03 so that when I look back at the clock, more time has passed,
01:25:06 but it's pretty ineffective, just because like,
01:25:09 I don't know, whatever, it like,
01:25:11 my brain is only like excited for the end to come
01:25:13 when I'm actually close to it,
01:25:15 like in that last minute or whatever,
01:25:16 but whatever, just saying, I do that too.
01:25:19 Like when I have to wait for longer things,
01:25:21 I count down from 60 and I always count down
01:25:24 because like, when I count up, it just feels like it doesn't,
01:25:27 it's not as satisfying as reaching like the last 10, nine, eight,
01:25:32 you know, it's just like, it's exciting.
01:25:34 Like the lesser the number, the more exciting it gets.
01:25:36 Like counting up is really, really tedious.
01:25:38 It could go on forever.
01:25:40 Like, well, okay, I reach 60,
01:25:42 but I can't go like 61, 62,
01:25:44 but when I'm counting down to like the last numbers,
01:25:47 like I need to reach zero, zero, zero,
01:25:49 and that's it, that's all, that's final.
01:25:51 Everyone's dead.
01:25:54 Tom or Gibb, do you have any boring passions in life?
01:25:59 I have, well, I don't know whether it's like a boring passion.
01:26:03 I thought just because like the things you said,
01:26:05 what didn't seem like passions,
01:26:07 they just seemed like funny things.
01:26:08 Yeah, that's true, that's true.
01:26:10 If we're talking about funny things,
01:26:13 I like to open doors the absolute minimum amount
01:26:16 that I need to slip through.
01:26:19 Oh, okay, okay.
01:26:21 Like, if I need to just leave my room,
01:26:23 I don't open the door the full way, I don't push it.
01:26:25 I just open it just enough to slip through like a cat.
01:26:28 Yeah, I was gonna say you're just like a cat.
01:26:31 Yeah, exactly like a cat.
01:26:32 Cause I feel like, well, I mean, I'm quite thin,
01:26:35 so I can slip through and I don't know why.
01:26:39 I think it's just sort of something I've always done
01:26:42 because why expend extra energy to push a heavy door
01:26:45 even further?
01:26:45 I would argue you're spending more energy
01:26:46 by doing it this way.
01:26:48 Okay, you know what?
01:26:48 I'm not here to judge.
01:26:49 This is just interesting.
01:26:50 No, but like, I do movements like that for no reason,
01:26:54 real reason.
01:26:55 Like I just like weird pirouettes and like moving swiftly
01:26:59 from like, I sort of glide.
01:27:02 Like when I'm getting a cup of tea, you know,
01:27:05 I put another kettle on and I sort of,
01:27:06 when it's time to get the milk in,
01:27:09 I sort of glide over to the fridge,
01:27:10 pull it open with enough force to like,
01:27:13 open the seal so that it's not like sticking
01:27:15 and then the door slowly opens and while it's opening,
01:27:18 like I let go of it to, to let it swing open slowly.
01:27:21 I grabbed the milk and then I kick it back
01:27:23 as I swoosh round like I twill around.
01:27:26 Like it's completely pointless,
01:27:28 but it's sort of like nice to have like a flow
01:27:30 to random pointless movements.
01:27:32 You've completely failed this question
01:27:33 because this isn't boring at all.
01:27:35 This is fascinating.
01:27:36 Yes.
01:27:37 Where was, where was this during
01:27:38 Give Makes Breakfast on the rag?
01:27:40 Yeah, I want to see those pirouettes and shit.
01:27:42 Well, it's only when I'm like really, really into,
01:27:46 not into, but like familiar with the location.
01:27:49 Right, right.
01:27:50 So like if I do something a lot,
01:27:51 I get, I get bored of like doing it normally.
01:27:54 So I just do it.
01:27:54 We need a candid camera of Give Makes Breakfast
01:27:58 in the home.
01:27:59 That's true.
01:27:59 Clearly.
01:28:00 I mean, I do a lot of talking to myself in the car
01:28:02 that I feel might be a similar sort of thing
01:28:04 where I'll just like yell things at myself.
01:28:06 Like just cause like I feel like I wouldn't do it
01:28:08 if there was a crowd,
01:28:09 but I like feel free and I can just like go crazy in my car.
01:28:13 It's why I love driving.
01:28:14 It's just like, I can just,
01:28:14 I'm free.
01:28:15 There's a sick animation video of a guy.
01:28:19 I can't remember what it's called.
01:28:20 I'll link it to you later.
01:28:21 It's like a guy is in his car.
01:28:23 He's going, he's doing a Mickey Mouse voice
01:28:26 and he's been all completely retarded.
01:28:28 And then he gets out of his car
01:28:29 and then he walks over to someone and just says, hey,
01:28:32 it's just like when you're in your car,
01:28:33 you're completely insane.
01:28:35 As soon as you come out, just like a normal person.
01:28:37 It's awesome.
01:28:38 Shout out to Sick Animation.
01:28:39 Maybe we can find that later and look at the shots.
01:28:40 I don't know how people do that.
01:28:42 Even when I know I'm completely alone
01:28:44 and no one can hear me,
01:28:45 I still can't like bring myself to do like noises,
01:28:48 like yell or sing loudly or something that I hear.
01:28:51 I do it all the time.
01:28:53 Yeah, I just turn into a complete idiot.
01:28:55 I just let my full autist just come out
01:28:57 when no one's around.
01:28:58 I do something.
01:28:59 I think you're joking, but that's kind of a half.
01:29:00 When I forget.
01:29:01 Like I'll just make weird sounds to myself.
01:29:03 I'll be like, ew, ew, ew.
01:29:06 I'll just do that.
01:29:07 I do that sometimes, but only when like I'm thinking,
01:29:09 I was like, I forgot how this sounds.
01:29:11 Or like, would I be able to make,
01:29:13 like would I be able to pronounce this thing?
01:29:15 So I just randomly say things sometimes, but not loud.
01:29:18 My brain just needs to like make sure it's alive sometimes.
01:29:21 So it just gives me like these weird vocal spasms.
01:29:23 It's like, yeah, your vocal cords still work.
01:29:25 Just double checking.
01:29:26 Oh, oh, I've actually got a boring passion.
01:29:29 Okay.
01:29:30 All right, I enjoy, I don't have a scrapbook,
01:29:32 but I collect things as if I was going to put them
01:29:35 in a scrapbook and I leave them in a drawer.
01:29:37 Things like every plane ticket I have,
01:29:41 every like thing, when they wrap the thing around the bag,
01:29:44 the bag tags, I keep those after I rip them off.
01:29:47 I just put them in there.
01:29:48 Cause any tickets or things that I've been to,
01:29:50 I'm like, you know what, that has a date on it.
01:29:53 I can look at that date and try to remember what happened.
01:29:55 So I'll keep it.
01:29:56 So that's really boring, but I enjoy doing it.
01:29:59 Yeah, okay.
01:30:00 That qualifies, that qualifies.
01:30:02 Like a stamp collecting thing.
01:30:03 It's pretty boring for people.
01:30:05 I mean, you know, other people don't care.
01:30:06 Yeah.
01:30:07 All right, all right.
01:30:09 Tom, did you have one?
01:30:10 I'm like trying to think of something actually.
01:30:12 I know it's hard, right?
01:30:13 I think mine was the total failure though.
01:30:14 I can't think of a good one.
01:30:15 I think there are probably things,
01:30:17 but they just blend into my life
01:30:18 cause I don't think about them 99% of the time.
01:30:21 Yeah, yeah.
01:30:22 It's hard to think of something that you can understand
01:30:26 as boring and also something that you are passionate about.
01:30:29 Yeah, that's true.
01:30:30 Cause if you are passionate about it,
01:30:31 you don't think of it as boring.
01:30:32 You know what?
01:30:33 I think I actually have one.
01:30:34 And this is sort of demonstrably boring.
01:30:36 It's like, I have a passion for playing video games alone
01:30:40 or like to like just like Zen, like cause like in college,
01:30:44 my friends would all gather around
01:30:45 and we'd play like all these games together.
01:30:47 But like when I was playing like
01:30:49 Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep came out during that time
01:30:51 and like people would like try to talk to me.
01:30:53 I'd be like, fuck off.
01:30:54 I'm playing like I care about what's happening.
01:30:56 Shut the hell up.
01:30:57 I can't stream games for that reason
01:30:58 because I still feel like there's a crowd of people.
01:31:00 Yeah, yeah.
01:31:01 I mean, I would only stream a game I like don't care about
01:31:03 or like have beaten a bunch of times.
01:31:05 That's the only thing.
01:31:06 If I play a new game, like get the fuck away from me.
01:31:08 Yeah, yeah.
01:31:09 Like when I talk to you, I don't want to see you.
01:31:10 When Ben and I did our legendary T-Bat plays
01:31:13 of Equestria Bound, I think one of the reasons
01:31:15 it was so nightmarishly horrible
01:31:17 and it lasted for more than a hundred episodes
01:31:20 was just because like, because of this like new game syndrome
01:31:24 where like I actually like was trying to like figure out
01:31:26 what was going on and I'm incapable of both like being
01:31:29 a funny let's play boy.
01:31:30 I mean, this was years ago at this point
01:31:32 and also like trying to like enjoy a new game.
01:31:35 I can't do both at the same time.
01:31:37 For a while I was streaming Devil May Cry 5
01:31:40 or DMC Devil May Cry.
01:31:42 And I could stream that fine
01:31:43 because like I'd already played that game
01:31:44 by like at least seven times by the time I streamed it.
01:31:46 So I was like just talking in the chat
01:31:48 and like having discussions and just like mindlessly
01:31:51 like destroying that game because it's super easy.
01:31:52 It's like me and my like in Boston
01:31:55 there's this awesome theater.
01:31:56 I don't know if it still does.
01:31:57 I assume it still does.
01:31:58 It plays the room like every like Friday night or something.
01:32:01 And it's like a big event and everyone has so much fun
01:32:03 because there's so many like community things.
01:32:05 Like we all win the spoons appear on screen.
01:32:07 We all throw spoons at the screen.
01:32:09 I've seen stuff about that.
01:32:11 You actually participate in those.
01:32:12 Oh, that sounds so fun.
01:32:14 We went a couple of times.
01:32:15 Dude, it's so much fun.
01:32:16 You guys should definitely come sometime.
01:32:17 But the thing is I took my friend John to one.
01:32:20 He had not seen the room before
01:32:23 and this was a nightmarish experience for him.
01:32:25 He had no idea what was going.
01:32:27 He was a mistake.
01:32:28 It was just like we were going anyway
01:32:29 and he was in town.
01:32:30 I actually haven't seen the room.
01:32:31 I keep planning on watching it.
01:32:33 Doug, you're gonna love it.
01:32:35 I promise you.
01:32:35 Yeah, I know enough about it.
01:32:37 It's even better than Gern-Loggin.
01:32:39 Well, let's not get crazy.
01:32:40 I feel like I'm overhyped for the room.
01:32:42 I feel like if I actually would have watched it,
01:32:45 it wouldn't be that fun.
01:32:45 I just, it seems fun to just like throw spoons
01:32:49 at the screen whenever spoons appear
01:32:51 and everyone's, spoons!
01:32:52 It just sounds so stupid.
01:32:54 I love it.
01:32:55 There's times when they go outside
01:32:57 and throw the ball around
01:32:58 that in the theater we have footballs
01:33:00 that we toss around to each other.
01:33:02 Oh God, it's, I mean,
01:33:04 just one of the best movie watching experiences
01:33:05 I've ever had.
01:33:07 But yeah, don't get overhyped.
01:33:08 I remember hearing about that movie first
01:33:10 from the nostalgia critic and his review of the room.
01:33:13 That was a lot of change.
01:33:14 And I must have watched a dozen times,
01:33:16 a dozen times I watched that video.
01:33:17 And then I was like, you know what?
01:33:18 Let's actually check out the movie.
01:33:20 And amazingly, it was even better
01:33:22 than the nostalgia critic review.
01:33:24 Of that movie.
01:33:25 I know, I know.
01:33:26 Shocking.
01:33:28 Okay, I've got one more question.
01:33:29 Actually, Tom, did you think of anything?
01:33:31 I mean, I don't know.
01:33:32 I mean, the only thing I can come up with
01:33:33 which is super fucking mundane and really boring
01:33:35 is that like when I'm just doing nothing sometimes,
01:33:38 I'll have like my phone or like a computer or whatever.
01:33:40 I kind of like just playing
01:33:41 with like the little animations that they put in
01:33:43 and just like trying to like slowly look,
01:33:45 like sometimes like I got an iPhone right now
01:33:47 if you swipe down, it goes like the search bar
01:33:48 but it slowly blurs out the background.
01:33:51 Like just slowly playing with that sometimes
01:33:52 like watching the animation.
01:33:54 Yeah, it's dumb.
01:33:55 I'm just like, yeah, this is cool.
01:33:56 It's a blur.
01:33:57 Fun.
01:33:58 And like any little thing,
01:33:59 I'll like play with little transitions like that
01:34:00 because I'm easily amused by things that move.
01:34:04 I am very passionate about like whenever I'm bored
01:34:08 or tired that I don't want to go to bed,
01:34:10 placing my forehead on the table and just sitting there.
01:34:14 Oh, that's awesome.
01:34:15 That's a perfect example.
01:34:17 She's passionate about placing her forehead on her desk.
01:34:20 I love that.
01:34:21 That's fantastic.
01:34:21 Waiting for death.
01:34:23 Somebody please draw a mage, waiting for death,
01:34:26 sitting at her desk with her forehead pressed to it.
01:34:29 Oh, I love that.
01:34:30 That's so visual.
01:34:30 I love that.
01:34:31 How long will you sit there for?
01:34:33 I sometimes actually sit for more than an hour
01:34:35 because I just-
01:34:36 Oh my God.
01:34:38 What a logic.
01:34:39 God damn.
01:34:40 To be fair, I am thinking about things
01:34:42 while I'm doing it.
01:34:43 I just don't, I just can't or don't want to go to bed
01:34:47 and I'm just too exhausted to do anything on the computer.
01:34:50 I knew we'd get a good one.
01:34:51 That's perfect.
01:34:52 Yeah, that's-
01:34:53 I love that.
01:34:54 Sometimes I do something similar,
01:34:56 but it's not when I'm tired,
01:34:58 it's when I feel like death.
01:34:59 When I'm really sick.
01:35:01 And I curl up in like the prayer pose for like,
01:35:05 you know, how Muslims pray,
01:35:08 they do that pose.
01:35:09 No, they're like head to the ground sort of thing.
01:35:10 Yeah, I just, that's the most comfortable position.
01:35:12 I go into the bathroom, I sit down there
01:35:14 with my head on the ground.
01:35:15 I know.
01:35:16 And I stay there for like until I feel better.
01:35:18 Wow.
01:35:19 And it works, it works like a charm.
01:35:22 Mohamed has blessed you, I guess.
01:35:24 I guess so.
01:35:24 Yeah, well, fantastic.
01:35:26 Are you facing Mecca when you do this?
01:35:27 Yeah, so that's an ask.
01:35:28 Are you facing Mecca?
01:35:29 I've never checked.
01:35:30 Oh, maybe you are.
01:35:31 I'm probably facing Mecca like one quarter of the time.
01:35:34 Your bathroom's positioned in such a way
01:35:36 that you just happen to be facing the Holy Land.
01:35:39 He's facing Mecca, AKA Gurren Logan, AKA Gundam.
01:35:43 Get it, do you understand the joke?
01:35:45 No.
01:35:46 All right, excellent.
01:35:47 I hate you.
01:35:48 Mecca, I get it.
01:35:49 Excellent, excellent.
01:35:50 Terrible.
01:35:50 All right, all right.
01:35:52 Here's one more question.
01:35:53 We should, where did it go?
01:35:55 This is from RU guy, or RU guy says,
01:35:58 I can't come up with a question.
01:35:59 What's your favorite anime?
01:36:01 Okay, no, I'm just kidding.
01:36:02 This is that actually was a question though.
01:36:04 You already made a terrible joke like that last week.
01:36:06 That I, it's funny to me every time.
01:36:08 Please keep asking what's your favorite anime.
01:36:10 No, don't.
01:36:11 It's so funny, I can't stop laughing every damn time.
01:36:16 Oh shit, where did it go?
01:36:17 Fuck, sorry.
01:36:18 I lost my place.
01:36:20 No, that wasn't it.
01:36:21 It was, God damn it.
01:36:23 I know I was gonna read something.
01:36:24 This is why you don't read the ones about anime.
01:36:26 The fucking anime questions are the bane
01:36:28 of this fucking question section.
01:36:31 No, I already read that one.
01:36:32 How about, no, that's shit.
01:36:36 Okay, here's one sort of relevant.
01:36:37 A meme slayer, and I think another person asked this to,
01:36:40 Iroxen basically asked,
01:36:41 biggest dip in quality from a franchise?
01:36:43 Like started good and did terribly.
01:36:46 I mean. I'm stuck.
01:36:47 Oh shit, and that was like, that wasn't even a reboot.
01:36:50 That was just the same thing.
01:36:51 It's just the same thing, it got so bad.
01:36:54 It got so bad.
01:36:56 I don't know, like, I really gotta watch that
01:36:59 American Psycho 2,
01:37:00 because I think it might be American Psycho 2
01:37:03 from what I've heard.
01:37:04 I think American Psycho 2 just makes me think of like
01:37:06 all those not really made by Disney,
01:37:09 not high budget Disney sequels.
01:37:12 Harvest Moon.
01:37:12 Right, Harvest Moon, really, you think so?
01:37:15 I've only played one, and only barely.
01:37:17 I've played one on the PC.
01:37:19 Have you played that one, or seen anything about it?
01:37:21 I've been playing Stardew Valley, but no, no, I have not.
01:37:24 Stardew Valley is not from the franchise.
01:37:26 It's like, there's like, it's been,
01:37:29 Harvest Moon things sort of like split between
01:37:31 like story of seasons and Harvest Moon,
01:37:33 and like the original Harvest Moon people,
01:37:35 I think are working on story of seasons games,
01:37:37 and the current Harvest Moon is just like,
01:37:40 absolute crap if you know anything about the PC one.
01:37:43 Oof, oof, that's terrible.
01:37:45 I never played, click disclaimer,
01:37:47 I never played like the old Harvest Moon games
01:37:49 because I never had a handheld.
01:37:51 I played one of the story of seasons games, and it was okay.
01:37:55 But the PC one, they charge like $40 for something
01:37:59 that's like worse than like a mobile game, I feel sometimes.
01:38:03 It's just like, oh, the graphics are so terrible.
01:38:05 How can they charge so much?
01:38:07 For something so horrible.
01:38:08 And like, I've heard the reviews and sort of like
01:38:13 the let's plays I've watched, I thoroughly researched
01:38:16 because I really wanted to get a Harvest Moon for PC
01:38:18 because I like PC games.
01:38:20 But like, it's so terrible, it's not worth the money.
01:38:24 It's so disappointing that I only got into the Harvest Moon
01:38:28 when it started being absolutely shit.
01:38:31 At least you got the old games, I guess.
01:38:33 I've got one.
01:38:35 Bionicle, the first six Bionicles were the coolest ones,
01:38:40 and then after that, they all sucked.
01:38:42 I totally stopped caring about Bionicle for that reason
01:38:45 because I really liked the first designs,
01:38:46 and they were super cool.
01:38:47 People were really into Bionicle.
01:38:49 Shut the fuck up, Nate, Bionicle's dope as shit.
01:38:52 I will kill you.
01:38:54 It literally is dope as adults of Bionicle.
01:38:58 This is a while ago.
01:38:59 I want Bionicle so bad, but they're too expensive.
01:39:02 And I lost all of mine.
01:39:04 Dude, yes!
01:39:04 No, Hippo, did you get like the Lego magazine back then?
01:39:07 Did they have that in the UK?
01:39:09 I did.
01:39:09 Did you get like the original like DC comic book
01:39:12 with like the little interactive CD
01:39:13 that like introduced all the characters
01:39:15 and like blew my mind to shit?
01:39:16 I didn't get that little CD.
01:39:17 It was so sick.
01:39:18 It had like full 3D animations
01:39:20 of like all the characters and introducing the world.
01:39:21 That is a big nostalgia, but I completely forgot about that.
01:39:25 But yeah, it was like a game cube sized CD.
01:39:27 Yes.
01:39:28 And it came with like the, it was like the first comic,
01:39:30 I had like the one with Kopaka, the ice guy,
01:39:32 that was like his store, his back store,
01:39:33 and then the disc had all the characters on it.
01:39:35 And like for the next couple of issues,
01:39:36 just kept up a comic that told about the characters.
01:39:38 I was like, I love this.
01:39:39 This is the coolest shit ever.
01:39:40 It was dope.
01:39:40 And I bought all the sets,
01:39:42 my mom hated me because I spent all her money,
01:39:43 but it was so cool.
01:39:44 And then like two years later, or like a year later,
01:39:47 they changed all the designs
01:39:48 and nobody looked cool anymore.
01:39:49 And I wanted to kill myself.
01:39:51 They fucking nummered them.
01:39:54 They nummered all of the blind people.
01:39:56 And they had too many bells, too many whistles.
01:39:58 The masks were not iconic anymore.
01:40:00 I agree.
01:40:01 They sucked.
01:40:01 I agree, the worst.
01:40:02 The only bionicle spin-off I liked
01:40:04 were the little spinny guys that turned into a ball
01:40:07 that you could ride around those with.
01:40:08 I remember those, yeah, yeah.
01:40:09 I think Biter told me about exactly what you guys
01:40:12 are talking about, like how they used to be cool,
01:40:14 but they're not anymore.
01:40:15 A long while ago, it's just like, this is so weird.
01:40:19 It feels like deja vu.
01:40:20 It still haunts me.
01:40:21 It still haunts me, the bionicle sucks.
01:40:23 Yeah, it's awful.
01:40:25 That's a good answer.
01:40:26 That's a good answer.
01:40:27 Well, hey guys, okay, enough questions for now, I guess.
01:40:30 But I've got a thing though.
01:40:32 So I've got two things to say.
01:40:34 Now, the number of the first one is I want to announce
01:40:35 on an actual episode, in case we haven't already,
01:40:38 the PCP Highlights channel exists now.
01:40:40 Did we mention that last time?
01:40:41 I don't think we did.
01:40:42 I don't think we did.
01:40:44 So there's a new channel, it's called PCP Highlights,
01:40:46 and it is highlights from various PCP episodes.
01:40:50 Now, it's time of recording, there's only one,
01:40:51 but there's going to be a bunch out
01:40:53 by the time you see this shit.
01:40:54 So I'm just letting everybody know.
01:40:55 That's where we're going to be putting highlights
01:40:58 in little clips, episodes and shit.
01:41:00 It's kind of trying to get off the floor right now.
01:41:02 It's basically just me doing it.
01:41:03 But you know, we're working on it, we're exploring.
01:41:05 I think people are going to appreciate it.
01:41:07 So there's that, there'll be,
01:41:08 I'm sure there'll be a link in the description,
01:41:10 and I'll probably put like a link in the channel banner
01:41:13 as well, you know, if you have links for that.
01:41:14 Are there people making their own clips as well already?
01:41:17 Yeah, a bunch of people have, I only made one,
01:41:19 a bunch of people have like submitted clips,
01:41:21 and a bunch of other people have just given time codes
01:41:23 for things they think are good things to do.
01:41:25 And if you go, if you're a patron,
01:41:26 and you go to the PCP Highlights channel
01:41:28 on the PCP Patron Discord,
01:41:31 then people are submitting stuff there
01:41:33 that I'm like taking suggestions from.
01:41:35 So if you just give a good moment, you know,
01:41:37 I'll give it a look over, and we'll see how this goes.
01:41:40 So, you know, just letting you know, just letting you know.
01:41:42 Should we announce the, I think we already announced it,
01:41:46 but like the contest for our theme?
01:41:48 Yes, that was announced two episodes ago
01:41:52 as of this happening.
01:41:53 And it's- Yeah, we forgot to mention it last time.
01:41:56 That's right, because like the episode hadn't come out yet,
01:41:58 so nobody's submitted anything.
01:41:59 But we've gotten at least one submission already
01:42:02 from our buddy AJ Shoup.
01:42:05 Now, like I, full disclosure, I have not listened to it yet.
01:42:09 I'm like, so like we're getting them in.
01:42:12 I think what we should do is by next time,
01:42:15 by next time we should wait for them,
01:42:17 some more ones to roll in, see how many we get,
01:42:19 and then do a review, or like kind of go over it
01:42:22 as a segment and see what we've got.
01:42:24 I mean like musical themes or something.
01:42:26 Yeah, yeah.
01:42:27 Intro themes for the procrastinators.
01:42:29 That's right.
01:42:30 So I guess for now what we'll say is,
01:42:31 so people, keep submitting them
01:42:34 and keep sending us your shit.
01:42:36 If you're a patron, go to the fanart warehouse
01:42:40 and submit them.
01:42:40 If you're not a patron, feel free to tweet us.
01:42:43 You know, what do we say?
01:42:43 Like hashtag PCP theme, I think was the deal,
01:42:46 or at TPCrastinators and we'll take a peek.
01:42:50 So do that and it sounds good.
01:42:53 Now, the only other thing I wanted to say
01:42:54 at the end of the episode here was,
01:42:56 so a while ago we did talk about doing like highlighting
01:42:59 people's like art and stuff.
01:43:01 And I think we should do that.
01:43:04 I think we should do that.
01:43:06 So we still got that fanart warehouse
01:43:08 in the patron discord there.
01:43:10 Other than that, you'll have to tweet at us
01:43:11 if you want to send us your shit.
01:43:13 So feel free to add TPCrastinators
01:43:15 and I guess hashtag PCP fanart?
01:43:19 PCP art?
01:43:20 I don't know, I'll check both of those.
01:43:22 So if you guys are in the fanart warehouse thing
01:43:24 on the patron discord, I'm looking there.
01:43:26 I also linked one in the main chat.
01:43:28 Check out this drawing who showed up
01:43:30 in the last bonus episode of the Lord of Ghosts himself
01:43:34 by Lens Lines.
01:43:36 I think it's Lines Lines, I think it is.
01:43:40 Looks awesome.
01:43:41 It looks awesome.
01:43:41 Does the Lord of Ghosts canonically have a gun?
01:43:45 Let's be serious here.
01:43:47 Well,
01:43:48 I mean,
01:43:49 Autistic Liberty is taking care.
01:43:51 It's the ghost of a gun because gun control laws
01:43:54 and they killed all the guns.
01:43:55 So now it's just the ghost of a destroyed gun.
01:43:57 Yeah, when you outlaw something,
01:44:00 the ghosts are now, they have it.
01:44:03 So they used to be drunk a long time ago
01:44:05 and now they're all hooked up on drugs,
01:44:07 but now weed is legal.
01:44:08 So now all they have is guns.
01:44:10 Excellent, excellent.
01:44:13 Check out this other one from the Undertailer fan account.
01:44:17 I think I've seen this around,
01:44:18 but it's submitted here regardless.
01:44:20 It's like, it's a magenta filter
01:44:21 overlaid picture of Briska
01:44:24 that says I have so much sex with my husband, Tavros.
01:44:29 This is Sublime.
01:44:30 This is Supreme.
01:44:31 That's Digi.
01:44:33 It's definitely like Digi, Briska.
01:44:34 I forget the,
01:44:36 I remember there was context to why he drew this
01:44:39 and I can't remember it.
01:44:40 Was there?
01:44:41 I mean, I get that it's like Digi, Briska.
01:44:42 Like this is what Briska would be like
01:44:45 if she were literally Digi.
01:44:47 But I like the,
01:44:49 I actually like everything about this.
01:44:50 This is great.
01:44:51 This is fantastic.
01:44:53 Now next one here is coming from
01:44:56 ya boi Chip in the Franks or Chip Wiseman
01:44:59 at Chip Wiseman Art on Twitter.
01:45:02 And it's a picture of a good ol' arm
01:45:04 defeating Digi for good and all
01:45:06 in the legendary Radcon 3 Royal Rumble.
01:45:08 I read what I-
01:45:09 One of the most amazing moments.
01:45:10 How he drew that, like the motion,
01:45:12 so it is-
01:45:13 And the impact feels tangible, I like it.
01:45:15 Yeah.
01:45:16 It's so dynamic.
01:45:17 It's so dynamic.
01:45:17 I love it.
01:45:19 By the way, these are from like months ago.
01:45:20 So like nobody's been submitting them.
01:45:23 Anything that has Digi getting his ass beat
01:45:26 is great day material to me.
01:45:28 I don't know about you guys.
01:45:30 That's, yeah.
01:45:31 I mean, that's pretty good for now.
01:45:32 The problem is we've just totally let this like lie
01:45:34 and like haven't been doing it at all.
01:45:35 So like we gotta-
01:45:36 We've been talking about it, we never really started.
01:45:37 So, you know, the best is right.
01:45:39 This is the start.
01:45:41 People send in images of PCP related stuff
01:45:45 and we will talk about it next episode
01:45:47 if you put it in or tweet at us.
01:45:49 I think the most reliable way is to use Twitter to,
01:45:52 let's develop a real hashtag right now for things for this,
01:45:55 that I can just search the hashtag and it'll all be there.
01:45:57 What we should do is if we're gonna do it on Twitter,
01:45:59 we should just create a moment on the PCP Twitter account
01:46:03 and gather all the tweets we got.
01:46:04 What the hell is a goddamn moment?
01:46:05 I don't know what-
01:46:06 You never use that.
01:46:07 A moment is a thing where you can save tweets
01:46:10 in like a gallery.
01:46:11 In a place.
01:46:12 That sounds actually super helpful.
01:46:13 It's what I use on Twitter for all my 3D stuff.
01:46:16 I just put them in a moment.
01:46:16 I have a moment of like when I invented
01:46:19 the alley-oop character.
01:46:20 Oh shoot, can I like make like a moment out of all
01:46:24 like the art sort of tutorial things that I favor?
01:46:29 The favorites.
01:46:30 Yes, you can make a moment for whatever you want.
01:46:32 Ah, that is so useful.
01:46:34 I've been wanting that.
01:46:35 There you go.
01:46:36 Yes.
01:46:37 Well that's cool, that's cool.
01:46:38 So all right, so maybe we'll do that
01:46:40 but I guess we should still just have a hashtag.
01:46:42 All right, let's call it hashtag PCP art.
01:46:45 All right, we'll go with that
01:46:46 and just whatever you wanna submit, we will look at it.
01:46:48 We'll do, we have to develop some like infrastructure
01:46:51 to actually listen to like music or something.
01:46:53 I don't know how we could work that in.
01:46:55 All right, but we're working on people.
01:46:56 We're trying to improve, we're trying to expand.
01:46:58 And you know, people have also been asking
01:46:59 about like having a voicemail box to listen to voicemails.
01:47:02 I'm totally down for that.
01:47:04 I'm totally down for that.
01:47:04 I mean we brought that up a while ago
01:47:05 but the problem was that logistically
01:47:07 we just don't know how to do it yet but I'm sure.
01:47:09 Yeah, that's right.
01:47:10 I'm sure we're a little bit of Googling
01:47:11 and maybe some actual effort.
01:47:13 Please send us instructions on how to do it.
01:47:15 I don't know, I'm too baby, I'm a baby.
01:47:18 I hope someone sends you a link.
01:47:19 When I hit two years old I'm gonna die
01:47:21 and I'll be replaced by another baby.
01:47:23 I'm not allowed to live.
01:47:24 My gun won't protect me from that age limit of my life.
01:47:28 But that's a good name.
01:47:29 It's a quality name.
01:47:30 Please draw that and send that to hashtag PZBR.
01:47:33 Please draw every baby with a gun.
01:47:36 Draw this perfect society of under two-year-old babies
01:47:39 all armed with guns and all the two-year-olds
01:47:41 being shipped off to the glue factory.
01:47:42 That sounds perfect.
01:47:44 No, to the gun factory.
01:47:45 The babies become the guns.
01:47:46 They get turned into guns.
01:47:48 Oh my God.
01:47:50 Well, I've done half your work for you artists.
01:47:52 Now get out there and put pencil to paper.
01:47:55 I'm the Ideas guy around here.
01:47:56 He is the Ideas guy.
01:47:58 All right, I think we're actually done now, everybody.
01:48:01 Hopefully we covered everything.

01:49:24 that just pipes back audio only about game review
01:49:27 and game analysis.
