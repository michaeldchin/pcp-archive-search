00:00:00 1, 2, 3, Sink!
00:00:03 And one more time. 1, 2, 3, Sink!
00:00:07 Okay, dope. I'll do the intro. Here we go.
00:00:11 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:18 I'm the best guy ever, and we've got a full house, ladies and gentlemen.
00:00:22 We're joined by such kooky characters as Ben Saint.
00:00:25 When you walk away, you don't hear me say, please, oh baby, don't go.
00:00:33 We've got Digibro. I'm still alive. Why?
00:00:38 That can be remedied. We've got Endless Jess here.
00:00:42 Hey, it's me, Bored James, and when I'm bored, I like to play some board games.
00:00:47 We've got Munchy wearing his tiny hats.
00:00:50 Guys, I don't want to alarm you, but I just found this book called The Bible,
00:00:53 and I think that it's got some crazy shit in it that we haven't considered up until this point.
00:00:57 And I think we deserved, you know, old classics given the Faraday.
00:01:02 It's not the best graphics, but I think it's got some real wicked truths in it.
00:01:05 How's the game feel? How's the game feel on that Bible?
00:01:08 Not very good. It's a hippocrit.
00:01:12 Damn it, hippocrit.
00:01:14 Uh, hi. It's me.
00:01:18 Uh, good. Oh, there's Tom Oliver. He's popping in and out.
00:01:22 You there, buddy? Tom?
00:01:25 Tom? Yes, it's me.
00:01:27 Okay, he's having issues.
00:01:29 Tom!
00:01:31 We'll see how it goes with him.
00:01:33 And we're today, guys, for the first time in a million years.
00:01:36 We're joined by an actual guest, Mr. Zen Huxtable.
00:01:40 I actually came here because I wanted to spite the three fans of the PCP who don't like me.
00:01:48 Give us their names.
00:01:51 I don't know their names because I...
00:01:53 Give us the names.
00:01:55 Stop hiding, though.
00:01:57 We're a chunt.
00:01:59 Y'all get down on that old-fashioned witch hunt over here.
00:02:02 I just have their names plastered all over my walls.
00:02:05 It motivates me to get out of the house.
00:02:07 I mean, that's what I do with my enemy's names.
00:02:09 I made those dolls out of them so I can stab them.
00:02:12 That's good.
00:02:14 If you put a commenter's name in, like, a voodoo doll,
00:02:17 is that as effective as, like, you know, DNA material or, you know...
00:02:22 Imagine, like, a commenter voodoo doll with just, like, a body pillow
00:02:25 with, like, a square screenshot of a YouTube comment on it?
00:02:29 It only works if the comment says first.
00:02:33 Tom, are you there, buddy?
00:02:36 I think... No.
00:02:38 No, we don't leave you.
00:02:40 Before he dropped out the first time, I heard his voice for, like...
00:02:42 Yeah, me, too.
00:02:44 I heard him mumbling about trying to figure it out.
00:02:46 Oh, shit.
00:02:48 Is this his scheme?
00:02:50 To get on those PC pennies without doing any work,
00:02:52 technically being on the episode?
00:02:54 Possibly.
00:02:56 I bet he'll pop up in, like, an hour as a ghostly whale,
00:02:58 and we'll, you know, just deal with that as it comes.
00:03:01 Okay, but anyway, people, let's get on to things
00:03:04 that are happening with us and fun times going on with us.
00:03:08 I got you, Nate.
00:03:10 It's got stuff. Yeah, okay.
00:03:12 This is what I've been doing all month, is I've been...
00:03:15 All three days of it?
00:03:17 Well, fair point. Yes.
00:03:19 But also, for the previous month,
00:03:22 is sitting around on the YouTube suggested page
00:03:25 and obsessively hitting Not Interested on everything
00:03:29 and, like, on, you know, blocking different channels,
00:03:32 because, like, I don't usually use the suggested page.
00:03:34 I usually am, like, solely in my subscriptions.
00:03:37 Um, but, like, it's just... there's just not enough.
00:03:40 There's just not enough shit to watch.
00:03:42 So I've been camping suggested, and, like, I will literally go in
00:03:45 and have, like, four rounds of reloading the page,
00:03:47 hitting Not Interested on absolutely everything,
00:03:50 reloading until I find the one video that I kind of want to watch.
00:03:54 And I got to say, it's a nightmare.
00:03:57 Yeah, I was gonna ask that.
00:03:59 Did you think that it would work out in your favor?
00:04:01 No, it did. It did work.
00:04:03 Does it even work?
00:04:04 It's also a nightmare.
00:04:05 I don't understand what the goal is.
00:04:07 So if the thing is, if you go into the suggested tab
00:04:10 and you hit Not Interested on a video,
00:04:12 it will never show up again.
00:04:14 Right.
00:04:15 And if you say Tell Us Why,
00:04:17 and then you say I don't want to watch videos from this channel,
00:04:19 that channel won't show up anymore.
00:04:21 So it used to be that my suggested was almost exclusively channels
00:04:24 I was already subbed to and videos I had already watched.
00:04:27 I have a couple of channels I'd like to hit that for.
00:04:30 Right, so I was just sitting there and I just...
00:04:32 Like all of them.
00:04:33 It doesn't fucking work for me.
00:04:35 Really?
00:04:36 I pressed Not Interested and it pops up like two days later.
00:04:39 Yeah, I was gonna ask.
00:04:40 Maybe it comes back.
00:04:41 I literally don't know what this feature is.
00:04:43 I've never gone into a suggested page.
00:04:45 It's like pressing the button on the crosswalk.
00:04:48 It doesn't do a damn thing.
00:04:50 It just makes you feel...
00:04:51 It gives you the illusion of power.
00:04:53 Yeah, I believe that.
00:04:54 The home page?
00:04:55 Because I'm just talking about the home page on you.
00:04:57 Okay, all right.
00:04:58 Okay, I understand now.
00:04:59 I'm on the same page.
00:05:00 Yeah, just the suggested videos section on the home page.
00:05:02 And there's just like a little three dots.
00:05:05 You can click on next to a video and click Not Interested.
00:05:07 But like...
00:05:08 Oh, no shit, huh?
00:05:09 Yeah, if you do that enough,
00:05:11 eventually, I mean, I killed anything I was subscribed to,
00:05:14 anything I'd already seen, you know, any stuff like that.
00:05:17 So eventually it started recommending me, you know,
00:05:19 exclusively stuff I've never heard of before.
00:05:21 However, here's the problem.
00:05:23 Is that YouTube also only recommends you shit related
00:05:26 to things that you have seen.
00:05:28 And therefore, let's say you watch a video like,
00:05:31 Endless Jess's New Video is a perfect example of this,
00:05:34 where he was talking about the Kingdom Hearts.
00:05:37 Like how there's like 90 videos explaining Kingdom Hearts.
00:05:40 So as soon as you click on one of them,
00:05:42 all of your recommendations are other videos
00:05:44 explaining Kingdom Hearts.
00:05:46 And it's like, I already watched a video.
00:05:48 That was my plan all along.
00:05:50 In that case, all of those had already been in my suggested
00:05:53 before I watched yours because of Nate's video.
00:05:56 So like, and that's the best part about this feature
00:05:58 is that when you click Not Interested and it asks you why,
00:06:01 and there are four options that can appear.
00:06:04 The first one is I've already seen it.
00:06:06 The second one is I don't like it.
00:06:07 The third one is I'm not interested in this channel.
00:06:09 And the fourth one is I'm not interested in recommendations
00:06:11 based on this video.
00:06:13 And it'll tell you what video it recommended you shit based on.
00:06:16 What the fuck button are you pressing where you got these options?
00:06:19 I see not interested.
00:06:20 Save to watch later.
00:06:21 Save to playlist and report.
00:06:22 You have to click on not interested and then it gives you a prompt.
00:06:26 Yeah. When you click not interested,
00:06:27 Oh shit.
00:06:28 things come up.
00:06:29 So tell us why.
00:06:30 Yeah.
00:06:31 Tell us why.
00:06:32 Oh, this is perfect.
00:06:33 Okay, cool.
00:06:34 I would never have even known that this was possible.
00:06:36 People have been telling me this for a while
00:06:37 because I always complained about YouTube recommendations being shit
00:06:40 and people were like, oh, well, you can filter them.
00:06:42 And I was like, that sounds really time consuming.
00:06:44 And it is really time consuming.
00:06:46 However, I've been doing it.
00:06:48 So eventually it will kill off all the shit you've already seen.
00:06:51 But like, again, the biggest problem is that it just recommends you other shit
00:06:55 that's like what you've seen before.
00:06:57 So if I watch like world's biggest hamburger,
00:06:59 it's like now I've got nothing but videos about possibly the same hamburger.
00:07:04 Like not even like another food item, but like just more on that.
00:07:08 Okay.
00:07:09 I hope you're going to tell me a success story here
00:07:11 because it just seems like you're saying like,
00:07:12 guys, did you know that YouTube isn't good in a certain way?
00:07:16 Like, yeah, it's terrible.
00:07:18 I expected more of you guys to have done this
00:07:20 because like so like literally every time I've complained about this people
00:07:23 like about the suggestions.
00:07:24 Everyone's like, oh, you can just like it works super well
00:07:27 if you just delete all the stuff.
00:07:28 I'll tell you, I subbed like I made my subscriptions my homepage
00:07:31 and I have never looked at that's what I've always done.
00:07:33 It does jack shit for me.
00:07:35 Yeah.
00:07:36 I get those suggestions days later.
00:07:38 I'll tell you, I did sub like six channels through this method.
00:07:43 So it's I saw you.
00:07:44 You linked that inner standing video or channel before.
00:07:47 Oh, no.
00:07:50 Yeah.
00:07:51 That was something that just came up in the recommendations
00:07:52 and it's like another like spirit science type of thing.
00:07:56 But it's like a guy who he's part of a group.
00:07:59 What was it called?
00:08:00 They were called like the energy group or something like that.
00:08:02 It was just like all the elemental masters.
00:08:05 I believe was their name.
00:08:07 Hey, I want to come back to that later.
00:08:09 Yeah, I know.
00:08:10 There's a whole bunch of channels like that.
00:08:12 There's a whole bunch of those weird spirit.
00:08:14 Like it's like a spirituality general channel.
00:08:16 Like they have like the binaural beats,
00:08:18 but then they'll have vlogs by this guy and then other stuff.
00:08:21 And like the video I linked you guys was just him like explaining all the big things
00:08:24 in the future for their company and stuff.
00:08:26 And it's like I like how it's it's inner standing as opposed to its opposite.
00:08:30 Yes.
00:08:31 Under standing or outer standing out.
00:08:36 Well, yeah, maybe Ben, let's just jump under the shit that you were.
00:08:40 Did you literally just in the middle of saying something or are you done?
00:08:43 I was done.
00:08:44 I don't know that.
00:08:45 I got the point.
00:08:46 I think that topic hinge on the function that we have a lot more to talk about.
00:08:51 Well, I guess what I was hoping to get you guys to talk about is like,
00:08:54 I figure you all see a lot of suggest.
00:08:57 I know hippo watches a lot of suggested videos.
00:08:59 I know.
00:09:00 Yeah, obviously the fact that Jesse put in his kingdom hearts video would suggest
00:09:05 that he also sees that shit.
00:09:07 I'm just wondering what you guys think about like suggested videos in general because
00:09:11 like that's the biggest way that you grow your channel is by appearing in the suggested tab.
00:09:16 For sure.
00:09:17 Kind of like I use them.
00:09:19 I kind of hate them.
00:09:21 I don't know if I feel like going and like curating them super.
00:09:25 I'm with you, Ben, but I have a slightly less like adverse reaction.
00:09:29 I use them.
00:09:30 I'm not like particularly like I want to seek them out like I would never do what you're
00:09:34 doing, did you?
00:09:35 Like I don't really want to like seek out new videos.
00:09:37 I have no reason to.
00:09:38 I'm sort of the middle between Ben and hippo where it's like,
00:09:40 I don't like the fact that I spend as much time as I do on YouTube,
00:09:44 but I don't dislike it either.
00:09:46 Okay, well, let me ask you this.
00:09:47 I'm not out here to hunt for more.
00:09:49 How the hell are you occupying your time?
00:09:51 I'm doing other things.
00:09:53 Like what?
00:09:54 You have an amazing.
00:09:56 It's always seemed to me, did you that you seem to have an amazingly large amount of free time
00:10:00 that I don't understand?
00:10:02 Cause I seem to have, I don't know.
00:10:04 I mean, for me, it's social interaction.
00:10:08 I talk to people a lot.
00:10:10 The difference between you and I is that your videos take a week in total time to make and
00:10:16 my videos take 10 minutes in total time to make.
00:10:19 So that's why I have so much free time.
00:10:21 This even seemed to add like the height of the content machine era.
00:10:24 It still seemed like you miraculously had tons of time despite producing.
00:10:28 Yeah.
00:10:30 I guess we're pretty easy to make.
00:10:31 It was mostly vlogs.
00:10:32 Yeah.
00:10:33 If I make a vlog or a podcast, I just like, you know, all I gotta do is hit record and
00:10:37 rant for that amount of time, throw it into Vegas, cut a little bit off the beginning
00:10:41 and a little bit off the end, render it, takes less time than it takes to record the video,
00:10:45 upload it, and it's done.
00:10:47 That's like 15 minutes, you know?
00:10:48 I mean, I guess you're right.
00:10:49 You know, you could cut out a step by just uploading as is and then editing it in YouTube.
00:10:54 That takes, it sucks so much.
00:10:56 The YouTube editor is terrible.
00:10:58 The YouTube editor is terrible and it takes a while to update.
00:11:01 Yeah, it takes longer than rendering a video, what I think.
00:11:04 Yeah.
00:11:05 Seems that way.
00:11:06 Especially with all my fucking cores and my processor, dude.
00:11:09 All right.
00:11:10 Like the whole thing with like recommended videos, I had watched, like I, you know, the
00:11:16 part of the reason I am now currently not watching YouTube is because I was one of those
00:11:20 people who would just watch all sorts of recommended things all the time because I would usually
00:11:28 just watch YouTube on my phone in bed.
00:11:31 So like I would, there would be like Wendover Productions who does like videos explaining
00:11:37 how flying works, like flights and the whole system of airplanes.
00:11:41 I know about him.
00:11:42 I'm all over there.
00:11:43 Yeah, those sort of things are cool and like anything about like, you know, a lot of YouTube
00:11:48 is just Wikipedia, but as a video.
00:11:50 That's the biggest thing I've been fucking running into and it's driving me insane because so
00:11:55 many of them are regurgitated.
00:11:58 First of all, if any video says 1001 as the time code, don't fucking watch that video.
00:12:03 That's fair.
00:12:04 Any video that's 10 minutes on the dot or just over, don't watch it because it's always
00:12:08 going to be insanely stretched out.
00:12:10 Like every video I click on has to like, you watch a video about like some specific food
00:12:16 and first they explain the concept of food, then they explain the whole history of the
00:12:20 city where the food comes from.
00:12:22 But like, you know, the cursory version and then like maybe at one point there'll be like
00:12:27 a sentence of unique information in the video and then like, so I've gotten to the point
00:12:31 where sometimes I see, sometimes I just see the thumbnail and it tells me enough of the
00:12:35 story.
00:12:36 There was one that was like opening a condom in a wind tunnel and like the picture is this
00:12:39 condom all inflated in a wind tunnel and I went, well, all right.
00:12:42 I don't need just a few minutes of that, you know.
00:12:45 I want to see it in motion.
00:12:47 I'm so sick of that shit.
00:12:48 I'm sick of videos that just do not have any kind of unique perspective at all that are
00:12:53 just regurgitating.
00:12:54 Like there's like, there's a channel called What Culture Wrestling where like, like five
00:12:59 times a day they'll post a video about some like wrestling goss or some shit and it's
00:13:03 just stuff from the wrestling subreddit that everyone's on.
00:13:07 Like you can, you can set your watch to it.
00:13:09 Like there'll be a popular post and within like an hour there'll be a video that is just
00:13:14 regitating the post on the subreddit.
00:13:16 I hate them.
00:13:17 I want them to burn and die.
00:13:18 I kind of feel that way.
00:13:20 I kind of feel that way.
00:13:21 I'm conflicted about it when it comes to Hippo.
00:13:24 You watch or you used to watch Trainer Tips, right?
00:13:26 The Pokemon Girl guy.
00:13:28 He, I mean, I like him more or less.
00:13:32 You know, I watch his videos.
00:13:34 That guy actually puts effort into his videos, right?
00:13:37 He does.
00:13:38 He does.
00:13:39 He does.
00:13:40 Trainer Tips is like the Casey Neistat of Pokemon Go.
00:13:45 He is exactly that.
00:13:46 He is like, he's that on purpose.
00:13:48 But like most of the information that he gives about the game, which is like half the reason
00:13:53 why I watch his stuff, probably three quarters.
00:13:55 I mean, he just gets it from subreddits.
00:13:57 Like he's not the one like doing the data mining or anything.
00:14:00 And sometimes I feel like, is this guy, is this, is it fair?
00:14:03 Is it fair that he's like, you know, he's, I mean, I know he's curating the information.
00:14:08 Yeah, it's not like he's not doing anything.
00:14:10 It's like the TLDR corner of YouTube.
00:14:11 All the reason why I watch his videos is because I like him.
00:14:14 You know?
00:14:15 I mean, I like him fine.
00:14:17 Uh, if it were just, if it didn't have anything to do with Pokemon Go, I wouldn't watch it.
00:14:21 Wait, was that Ghostly Voice Tom?
00:14:23 Is he alive?
00:14:24 I live.
00:14:25 I live in Brazil.
00:14:26 Oh, okay, okay.
00:14:27 There you go.
00:14:28 All right.
00:14:29 We were having issues.
00:14:30 Okay.
00:14:31 I don't try and get down recommended holes too often.
00:14:33 But what I do do, which is extremely adverse to my health.
00:14:36 And I actually, many times in front of the show, is I go on the trending feed every single
00:14:43 day.
00:14:44 Every single fucking day of my life.
00:14:46 Listen!
00:14:47 I want to talk about Good Mythical Morning and then fucking, uh, uh, Philip DeFranco.
00:14:53 That's so zoomercore.
00:14:54 That's the zoomercore thing you've ever said in your entire life.
00:14:57 Anyway, I see, I see these videos.
00:15:00 Zoomercore.
00:15:01 And they're like what you're describing.
00:15:02 They're just like, huh, what if we fucking deep fried a thing that was already deep fried?
00:15:08 What's up guys?
00:15:09 It's Good Mythical Morning.
00:15:10 Like, like, I don't, I can imagine it would be gross.
00:15:14 Like most of what I'm getting, I guess this is because of the type of stuff that I have
00:15:18 clicked on.
00:15:19 But almost all I get is like informational videos with like very standard editing.
00:15:25 Like stuff that's like, if you took one of my videos and took a sentence from it and extrapolated
00:15:30 it to 10 minutes, that's what I get recommended.
00:15:33 Like, and it's a lot of it is like NBC and shit like that, you know, or like, uh, god
00:15:39 one of the worst is like this, what's called munchies or something.
00:15:42 Yeah, I fucking hate that guy.
00:15:46 It was just some, uh, no it was, it was mashed, that's what it's called.
00:15:50 Mashed is like a food channel.
00:15:51 I think I've seen that.
00:15:52 Yeah, it's mega big, but like the videos will literally be like literally one sentence
00:15:58 of information surrounded by eight and a half minutes of video.
00:16:02 And then you're sitting there watching it.
00:16:03 It's not the channel that does like, really talk about like such and such a restaurant
00:16:06 is really bad for you or something.
00:16:08 Just anything.
00:16:09 They put out videos constantly.
00:16:10 You know, speaking of channels that are really massively big and also completely worthless,
00:16:17 I saw a video the other day.
00:16:19 I didn't try to, it wasn't on purpose, but I, I ended up seeing a video by I hate everything.
00:16:26 No, I'm sorry for your loss.
00:16:32 Has there ever been a more worthless form of content than I hate everything's entire
00:16:38 channel?
00:16:39 There is like, you could like just watch an entire video of this, any video, it doesn't
00:16:43 matter which one there, you will not find a single unique thought anywhere.
00:16:49 Jesse, please describe to me what the content was in general because I don't know anymore.
00:16:54 It's been years.
00:16:56 Well, it's just like, I mean, it's like the one I watched was I hate our gaming the subreddit.
00:17:02 And first of all, right away, I see exactly what you're fucking doing.
00:17:06 I see through you.
00:17:07 You're just, you're making a video about hating the subreddit so that it will get big on that
00:17:10 subreddit.
00:17:11 You fucking phony, but sure, sure, but that's just moral outrage has nothing to do with
00:17:16 why I actually hate the channel.
00:17:18 It's just like, he says it's not even like a human being with an actual perspective.
00:17:24 It's just like a chronicling of how people feel about this certain topic because everything
00:17:29 he says is everything that everyone says.
00:17:31 He never says anything unique and he's not even like a good writer.
00:17:34 Like nothing he says is even funny.
00:17:36 There's never a sentence that's put together in an interesting way.
00:17:39 It's just the most fucking, it's like, it's like, I would call it vanilla, but even vanilla
00:17:45 is a flavor.
00:17:46 It's like, it's like the flavor of gray, like gray paste through a, through a, through a
00:17:52 tube in my mouth.
00:17:53 Like when you click on his videos, I feel like you're expecting it to be like an angry
00:17:56 vitriolic rant, but it's just like a regular ass analysis video with very bland editing
00:18:02 everything just slides into place.
00:18:03 There's not even any like passion in the delivery.
00:18:05 Like I don't get why it's called, I hate everything.
00:18:06 I mean, I know why it's called that.
00:18:08 It's a great gimmick.
00:18:09 It's a perfect name.
00:18:10 That name has probably elevated him more than his actual content because he has the gimmick
00:18:14 to be able to say, I hate blank on every video.
00:18:17 But like, and you know, there's tons of videos about guys who rant about things angrily and
00:18:21 you know, they're all fine.
00:18:22 They're fine because they're actually, you know, ranting angrily, but like the, oh, I
00:18:27 hate them.
00:18:28 There's just no, he's not a person.
00:18:29 He's like just, he takes things that everyone is saying and then he just repeats them in
00:18:34 this monotone.
00:18:35 He just is the algorithm.
00:18:36 He is the algorithm.
00:18:37 That's exactly it.
00:18:38 He's in like, his videos exist purely, I believe, so that trillions of years from now on a satellite
00:18:44 in a hard drive.
00:18:45 There can just be like a chronicling of like how people felt about a certain thing at a
00:18:49 certain time.
00:18:50 Because beyond that, beyond, beyond a purely historical perspective, there is no work for
00:18:54 that.
00:18:55 You've described exactly how to succeed is say, say things everyone agrees with.
00:18:58 No, that's the funny thing about it is like, that's something that I've been criticized
00:19:02 for not doing before that like, like Glass Reflection, who was the first big anime reviewer
00:19:08 on YouTube, like he literally like went out of his way to do that, to like try to have
00:19:14 the perspective that was like the most agreed upon, like to, because he thought of himself
00:19:19 as writing an objective review.
00:19:21 So like, you know, which obviously that's the correct way to do it because that's what
00:19:25 works.
00:19:26 None of us are fucking successful.
00:19:27 Like I know that like, I'm not trying to come off like bitter, but like I know that
00:19:31 that that's what works.
00:19:32 But personally, I find it repugnant and I like, I can't, I don't understand who would
00:19:36 watch it.
00:19:37 Like who is that channel for nobody?
00:19:40 It's for everybody.
00:19:41 It's for everybody.
00:19:42 So when you say like objective review, are you talking about like he, he, he basically
00:19:47 surveys what everyone thought and they like finds the middle ground into that or what?
00:19:52 It's not so much the middle ground is that like, let's say it's just like all the most
00:19:56 stated things.
00:19:57 So like generally people say that this show has really good animation, but a really weak
00:20:03 story.
00:20:04 Like he's just going to say like, oh yeah, the show, you know, like you're in Logan,
00:20:07 for example.
00:20:08 Right.
00:20:09 And like, if, if enough, as he famously said, not to say that I don't think he agrees with
00:20:12 the things that he's saying necessarily and like, but he got into huge trouble one time
00:20:17 when he just wrote a review where his perspective was different from the majority.
00:20:22 Like, because he wrote about, uh, no, yeah, he wrote about no sake and he didn't really
00:20:27 like it.
00:20:28 And like just the way that he complained about it, like he got a ton of dislikes and
00:20:31 all these people were on his ass and then like, he kind of switched gears and started
00:20:34 doing like more, you know, like less of that style.
00:20:37 Just because of that, you know, like realizing, because it was also not working.
00:20:40 His channel was dying.
00:20:41 Right.
00:20:42 Um, like, I'm not even mad at the person behind the channels because like, I get why
00:20:47 they do it.
00:20:48 Cause it works.
00:20:49 I'm more, I'm more frustrated with the people, the audience that keeps like swallowing this
00:20:53 like, why, why does anyone like it?
00:20:55 I don't understand what's entertaining about it.
00:20:57 The reason they like it is that they want to have that timeless chronicle of what everyone
00:21:01 thought.
00:21:02 Like that's how they're thinking of it.
00:21:03 Or they just want like noise to fill the void in their, in their cars.
00:21:06 I don't think that, I don't think that they're that prudent.
00:21:09 They don't want that.
00:21:10 And I mentioned like, there's a lot of, there's a big market for just, you know, like who's
00:21:14 going to fucking remember like what some seasonal anime or whatever it's, people want to hear,
00:21:19 Oh, there's a good anime that I can like watch this video of and feel good about being an
00:21:24 anime fan and identifying as one because even if, even if they're not even specifically
00:21:28 validating this person's experience of the show, they want to hear that like good things
00:21:33 are happening in anime so I can feel like a helpful, good, you know, member of the human
00:21:37 race.
00:21:38 You know what's fucked?
00:21:39 I want that feeling, but I can't get it cause they're all liars and or wrong or dumb.
00:21:44 You're too, you digi.
00:21:45 I mean, this is your whole thing.
00:21:47 The fact that this, this is something I definitely admire about you.
00:21:50 You will not just accept that you, you do your whole finish or fail thing.
00:21:54 You will, you have to go see it for yourself or it'll just let someone tell you it was
00:21:58 like good or bad.
00:21:59 I mean, that's the thing.
00:22:01 Like I think the reason people can appreciate these videos is that they just have basic
00:22:05 taste and like what it comes down to is like, if you haven't seen enough shit, everything
00:22:11 is more impressive.
00:22:12 You know, like the first time you ever see like a kind of cool, like death scene in
00:22:16 an anime, you're like, Oh my God, anime is so fucking cool.
00:22:20 I want to watch more violent shit.
00:22:21 But like, you know, it could be just some basic ass, you know, regular show that anyone
00:22:26 who really cares about the medium wouldn't care about because they're like, Oh, you
00:22:28 can get so much better violence from this show and this show and this one's got great
00:22:32 action scenes.
00:22:33 And then it's like, when you've been through all that, then you can't take the other stuff
00:22:36 seriously anymore.
00:22:38 These people just haven't.
00:22:39 And like, I've seen too much to be placated and that's why I have to be someone on the
00:22:44 speaking end.
00:22:45 But then it's, it's like, you don't have to have seen that much to be on the speaking
00:22:49 end and nobody's going to check you for it, you know, and you don't try to talk about
00:22:55 shit like this though.
00:22:56 You just like watch a show and then you say how that show like what was interesting about
00:23:00 it to you.
00:23:01 There's no, you're never like, Oh, 2018, great year for anime, you know, right?
00:23:06 That's not my wheelhouse.
00:23:07 No, like in, I hate, hate when people do shit like that, when they haven't seen everything.
00:23:12 You know, it's like, how can you make a statement like 2018 is one of the best years of anime
00:23:17 if you haven't watched every show from every year?
00:23:20 Like, I like that.
00:23:22 I don't like his reviews, but I like that YMS will release his list like that like years
00:23:27 later so he can see everything.
00:23:29 That's the biggest thing that I love.
00:23:32 I love YMS is like old like year roundups years later.
00:23:35 I have like, I never watched movies like the rare times that I like of my own volition
00:23:41 watch a movie.
00:23:42 It's because he recommended one in like a best of like 2014.
00:23:45 Those are what inspired Finisher failed in the first place by the way.
00:23:48 Because his taste is so different from mine that anything he's negative about, I usually
00:23:52 want to strangle him because he's a fucking idiot, but like, but I like hearing him talk
00:23:56 about the things that he likes.
00:23:57 So those are the videos.
00:23:58 I just like that his taste is very consistent.
00:24:00 So you know, like if he gives a movie a super high recommendation, like, I don't assume
00:24:05 that it's going to be good for me, but I know exactly what it's going to be like.
00:24:10 You know?
00:24:11 Yeah, it's weird because like, I'm not even necessarily that interested in the videos.
00:24:14 I'm just interested in like the idea that someone is that interested in the medium that
00:24:20 they will watch everything from like a certain year and then like catalog what their favorites
00:24:24 were.
00:24:25 Yeah, that's crazy to me.
00:24:26 And then we get to reap the benefits of their, you know, like sorting out the cream from
00:24:30 like they spent the time and we got mixed.
00:24:31 You mixed your mind.
00:24:32 Thank you.
00:24:33 I maybe I did bad.
00:24:34 I did.
00:24:35 You're you're being real chaffed to me right now.
00:24:39 Everyone knows the chaff rises to the top of the cream.
00:24:42 So I'm what we know when you when you're when you're when you're threshing your milk in
00:24:47 the old milk mill.
00:24:50 What all this looking at YouTube has made me think about is the fact that like the reason
00:24:54 this is happening is that YouTube is replacing TV and people don't have enough to watch.
00:24:59 And that's why they're going to.
00:25:00 I don't think that people necessarily would prefer to watch these types of videos over
00:25:04 something legitimately good, but that they just are trying to fill as much time as possible.
00:25:09 And usually it's just going to keep recommending them the same type of shit, you know, that's
00:25:12 definitely true.
00:25:13 So you just get kind of trapped in a loophole of it.
00:25:15 And I do think there's a growing amount of like, like the audiences don't seem satisfied
00:25:19 by this.
00:25:20 Like it doesn't seem like people are happy with it.
00:25:22 But I know how to solve this problem.
00:25:24 It's not easy, but it's going to require a big push from people like me who have already
00:25:29 been pushing for this, but we need more people pushing for just broadening people's tastes.
00:25:34 Because if you like, let's say that you sub like 10 daily vloggers and like that's, that's
00:25:41 enough content to keep you occupied throughout each day, but it's all low effort, like basic
00:25:46 ass content.
00:25:47 Well, what if you follow like 500 channels that all post once a month and everything
00:25:52 they do is great?
00:25:53 Well, you'd be in, you know, everything you'd be watching is great and you'd have enough
00:25:56 to fill your day.
00:25:57 But like because I feel like there was a time when you could have done that.
00:26:01 And because of the fact that everyone's incentivized to try to be by themselves enough content
00:26:06 to fill someone's whole fucking day, that's no longer viable as an individual, you know,
00:26:12 like, so I think that if we could get the audiences to just care about a broader range
00:26:17 of things and to be more, you know, to just know more and maybe this, maybe this period
00:26:24 will help that happen when everyone becomes desensitized to this information when like
00:26:28 everyone fucking knows everything.
00:26:30 That's how I felt about our day I learned.
00:26:33 Everybody's got to go watch the stupid character rumble.
00:26:36 The only video that's good.
00:26:38 That's a perfect example of a great video that most people are never going to find.
00:26:44 But like, we need more people talking about what's the best stuff out there, you know,
00:26:49 you know, it's just speaking of the best stuff out there.
00:26:53 Let me talk about, you mentioned it before, a little book called Legend of the Ten Elemental
00:26:57 Masters.
00:26:58 Do you guys know about this book?
00:26:59 You've talked about it before.
00:27:01 Have I?
00:27:02 Yes.
00:27:03 Okay.
00:27:04 Okay, well.
00:27:05 I've read it at because you own a copy.
00:27:06 In fact.
00:27:07 Oh, right.
00:27:08 Did I lend you my copy?
00:27:09 Right.
00:27:10 Oh, I didn't mean to.
00:27:11 Well, I was...
00:27:12 Well, for the...
00:27:13 All right.
00:27:14 So for the last maybe six months or so, I've been using it as like a...
00:27:16 It's been under one of the legs of my table propping my table up.
00:27:20 I've seen the way that your desk works.
00:27:23 But I recently actually purchased some table risers.
00:27:26 So I got all my great literature out from under my table legs.
00:27:31 So I had my copy free again and I was thumbing through it on the toilet, you know, like I
00:27:36 do.
00:27:37 And I was like, man, what a great unique piece of literature.
00:27:41 It's like nothing else that's ever been written or so I thought, but more on that later.
00:27:47 And I had reached out to Oolulilia, the guy who wrote it like months ago about like, what
00:27:53 if I recorded an audiobook of this and he never responded.
00:27:57 And then on a whim, I was like, I'm going to do it again.
00:27:59 So I contact him again and this time he responds.
00:28:02 And over the next like day, I negotiate an exclusive rights deal for the audiobook rights
00:28:08 to produce the audiobook.
00:28:09 And I'm doing it.
00:28:10 Whoa.
00:28:11 Yes.
00:28:12 And it's going to be...
00:28:13 You are incredible.
00:28:14 You got to let the people know because people who don't know about this guy will just think,
00:28:18 okay, just some, I don't know, indie author or something.
00:28:21 Please let them know.
00:28:22 This is not just someone.
00:28:24 I think we've talked about Oolulilia on the show before about his website with his list
00:28:28 of ones.
00:28:29 There's a lot.
00:28:30 I could go...
00:28:31 You know, there's a lot to say.
00:28:32 You have the Clip Notes version.
00:28:33 Clip Notes version at least.
00:28:34 I mean, he's like a super OCD guy.
00:28:37 He's spent like, he used to be known for...
00:28:41 He did these extremely like hyper detailed sort of let's play like walkthroughs of like
00:28:47 Ultima and like Bubsy 3D and stuff and he's very strange and he was working for a long
00:28:54 time on this game called Platform Masters in which like seemingly the most important feature
00:28:58 was the extremely accurate parallax scrolling of the backgrounds as your character moved
00:29:04 at high velocities.
00:29:05 I would describe him as like a likable low cow.
00:29:08 Like he's somebody...
00:29:09 Yeah, yeah.
00:29:10 He would have a Down the Rabbit hole video made about him but he is not...
00:29:14 He's never done anything shitty as far as I know.
00:29:17 Yeah, nobody hates him.
00:29:18 He's not an asshole.
00:29:19 Yeah.
00:29:20 He's not an...
00:29:21 He's in no way an asshole.
00:29:22 He's just created really bizarre things.
00:29:23 Like for instance, in this book that Ben is talking about, every time an object is described,
00:29:28 the hexadecimal color, like the hex code for whatever color that object is is placed
00:29:34 in the text and is that color?
00:29:37 Like it is colored that way.
00:29:38 So like you got hex codes constantly.
00:29:40 The power systems are like extremely detailed.
00:29:43 There's like a whole infographic about how flight works.
00:29:46 Yeah, like it's like how characters move their arms, it's like how does a character
00:29:51 move their arms and like what does a different arm motion mean?
00:29:54 Like in terms of like pitch and yaw of like the angle of their flight and stuff.
00:29:59 And like he'll describe time stopping Final Fantasy style for an extended like spell animation
00:30:05 to play out and then he'll describe like a green, like a red like damage number with
00:30:10 like in scientific notation like popping out and he'll say like the number bounces three
00:30:16 times like a ball.
00:30:17 The number is in the Tahoma font, but narrower.
00:30:20 It is size 168 and half an inch thick or whatever.
00:30:27 And fuck, I forgot what I was going to say because that was too funny.
00:30:33 It's really fucking weird.
00:30:34 It's unique all right.
00:30:35 So I did, I recorded one take, okay.
00:30:39 He gave me, he authorized me to release.
00:30:41 If you get into bed with this man, considering the level of OCD he has, what kind of demands
00:30:46 are going to be made on you to meet his very particular, you know, style or requests?
00:30:52 You know, funny and he actually told me that he doesn't really care that much about Legend
00:30:57 of the Ten Elemental Masters anymore because he's actually got a new book that I don't
00:31:01 think anyone's heard of.
00:31:02 He's got a new book called Secret in the Basement.
00:31:05 And one of the ways that I cajoled him into letting me like Jesse.
00:31:09 And it's written by R.L.
00:31:12 Stein.
00:31:13 It is also, I don't know much about it.
00:31:16 It's also an RPG based book, so I'm sure it's very interesting in that way.
00:31:21 I ordered a copy, but I haven't read it yet.
00:31:23 It's still being shipped to me.
00:31:25 Oh, so it's actually out?
00:31:26 Well shit.
00:31:27 It is.
00:31:28 Yeah, yeah, and nobody knows about it.
00:31:29 And I told him like, Hey, you know, if I do this, like this audio book, like I will
00:31:32 plug your new book in it and like, I don't think a lot of people know about it.
00:31:36 So like, you know, people who like the first one, they'll find out about this new one.
00:31:40 Maybe this is patronizing and I don't mean to insult the man by saying this, but like
00:31:43 ever since maybe this is like underestimating him.
00:31:46 But like ever since I heard you, you tell me about him initially and like, he sounded
00:31:50 like a weird freak, like an OCD guy who would just be a burden on his parents and everyone
00:31:54 around him.
00:31:55 But then like you told me that like there was a time in his life where he decided he
00:31:58 needed to like pull his own weight and like not burden his parents.
00:32:02 So he wrote Legend of the Ten Ella Masters like to sell to help like support his family.
00:32:07 And I was like, now I like this guy officially.
00:32:09 Yeah, the reason the reason he published the book at all was like to, you know, pay his
00:32:14 parents back like some rent.
00:32:16 Good man.
00:32:17 So he could like, yeah, because like he couldn't live on his own because he's pretty messed
00:32:21 up or he wasn't.
00:32:22 I think he's better now.
00:32:23 I think he's gotten over a lot of his hyper OCD tendencies.
00:32:25 That's good.
00:32:26 He published it to make money to like to help support his parents or whatever.
00:32:29 Anyway, God's being a superhero.
00:32:31 It doesn't sound like like a long cow.
00:32:33 He sounds like the next step in human evolution.
00:32:36 His fucking website.
00:32:37 I love his phobias, by the way.
00:32:39 My favorite thing about you on there is fears.
00:32:41 Yeah, you find his website fears.
00:32:44 A lot of those are outdated, but at the time he was like the list of like his fears of
00:32:49 all his the best pages, all his dreams page, because the life page, it literally ranks
00:32:53 them by like how capable he is, how much he wants to do it, why he like wants to do
00:32:59 it, and what like how likely he thinks it is that he could do it.
00:33:02 And like, there's some stuff in there that he doesn't even want to do.
00:33:07 Like there's stuff that his yeah, wanting to do it ranking is like not at all, but he
00:33:12 has it on his bucket list because I guess he just thinks he should.
00:33:15 Yeah.
00:33:16 And it'll be stuff that he learned about on travel shows and stuff or like become like
00:33:20 like do a boxing match.
00:33:22 And it's like, I have no desire to do this.
00:33:23 And I don't think I'm capable.
00:33:25 It'll probably never happen.
00:33:26 But here it is on my bucket list.
00:33:29 He cataloged like thousands of his dreams.
00:33:32 He had a he had like a long D dream diary that I never read.
00:33:36 I think the website's down, but like I'm sure it's archived somewhere.
00:33:40 And he's he will like update how he like conquered some of those fears where like he had a fear
00:33:45 of open water, but he spent like years conquering it.
00:33:49 Yeah, that's great.
00:33:50 He's he's got a job now.
00:33:52 Yeah, he works at Walmart.
00:33:53 They're good.
00:33:54 Great.
00:33:54 Yeah, one.
00:33:56 OK, I guess the last thing about that is that so I recorded a take.
00:34:00 OK, he authorized me to put to do the first two acts and put them on YouTube.
00:34:05 So the first two acts of the audiobook are going to be on my channel.
00:34:10 And then he didn't want the rest of it released for free.
00:34:13 But he said we talked about like recording the full audiobook and like releasing it
00:34:18 through like Audible or something like that.
00:34:20 So that's the plan.
00:34:21 The first two acts are going to be on my channel and really, really stoked.
00:34:25 I recorded the I did a take yesterday, but I didn't like it.
00:34:28 I rerecorded it and I included the hex codes.
00:34:31 The first god didn't.
00:34:32 Yeah, the first take did not include the hex codes.
00:34:35 And I was like, no, fuck it.
00:34:36 I need to preserve the author's vision.
00:34:38 So I included the hex codes, doing all the voices.
00:34:42 It's really fun.
00:34:43 And you are I have I have the whole audio for the first two acts done.
00:34:46 And I was editing it until this podcast start.
00:34:49 I'm going to go back to ten tangentially related.
00:34:51 But I actually made an audio book a few days ago of a sideways stories
00:34:56 from wayside school. Oh, dude.
00:34:58 A book that I love for my childhood.
00:35:00 I think was I telling you about that munchie?
00:35:02 Was I talking to you about sideways stories by Lewis Sacker?
00:35:05 If you did, it was in one ear at the other.
00:35:08 I was talking about that to someone.
00:35:10 Yeah, that's a shame, because it's a great book.
00:35:13 It's a great series. It's awesome.
00:35:15 It is. Did you ever read?
00:35:17 Did you ever read the, like, math puzzles, like side series?
00:35:21 No, I didn't know.
00:35:23 I wasn't even aware that was a thing there.
00:35:25 Yeah, I had a couple as a kid.
00:35:26 They're like, um, it's it's it's, you know, it's like the teacher.
00:35:29 God, I forget the teacher's name.
00:35:31 Miss Jules, I know that kind of just read it.
00:35:33 Yeah, like it's like Miss Jules, like, OK, she'll write like a math thing
00:35:38 on the blackboard and be like, who can solve this math puzzle?
00:35:41 But it's not actually a math puzzle.
00:35:43 It's actually like a like a hidden letter.
00:35:46 Like you have to, like, decode the letters in the math and like or something.
00:35:50 I don't know. I'm apprehensive.
00:35:52 But is this like a game or is it a book?
00:35:54 It's like a puzzle book. Yeah.
00:35:55 Oh, yeah.
00:35:56 Zen, yeah.
00:35:57 Yeah, why did you post that on your side channel instead of your main channel?
00:36:00 Do you want me to post on my main channel?
00:36:02 I'll do it. I'm just curious.
00:36:03 I'm curious about the logic.
00:36:05 I'm curious. Why did you record an audio book of sideways stories?
00:36:08 Well, obviously, I want to clutter up his illustrious channel
00:36:11 with such masterpieces like why victorious is a hidden gem and whatnot.
00:36:15 Yeah, exactly.
00:36:16 Why Dan Schneider is my idol and my guide, you know, such other pop.
00:36:20 I love. Yeah.
00:36:23 No, Zen, what what made you what made you record this?
00:36:26 What what what could possibly possess you?
00:36:30 I think it literally just popped up in my mind.
00:36:32 So I was like, OK, let me just look it up on Google and see if there's a PDF.
00:36:37 And there was. So I was like, people need to know about this.
00:36:41 But apparently not enough people to put it on my main channel for some reason.
00:36:44 So well, maybe I will know.
00:36:47 I'm curious about the logic because, like, for me, the logic has begun.
00:36:50 Do you have the rights to do that?
00:36:52 Well, well, I'm not monetizing it.
00:36:54 Is that OK? That's probably fine.
00:36:57 I would imagine. Maybe.
00:36:58 Question mark. I think I suppose theoretically they might object on the grounds
00:37:01 that like you've made that information of that book available without purchase.
00:37:05 But they can't. I don't know.
00:37:07 You know, I'm not worried about.
00:37:08 I knew like I knew that I could, you know, do Legend of the Ten Elemental Masters.
00:37:14 Like I could record it and put it on my channel and get away with it.
00:37:17 Like I knew the guy wasn't going to sue me or anything.
00:37:19 Well, but I just I just wanted I just I just wanted his like I wanted to be able
00:37:24 to say like, yeah, this is official.
00:37:25 This is like endorsed by the creator.
00:37:27 This is this is the real shit.
00:37:30 Well, plus now it's not it's not as though you're just doing it of your own accord.
00:37:34 Now it sounds like there's a deal be brokered here.
00:37:37 Now now you are in bed with them and now you are best friends.
00:37:41 Ben is really you.
00:37:42 I would you're best friends.
00:37:43 Yes, you're carving yourself out, Ben.
00:37:45 A fascinating niche as like internet cryptid connoisseur.
00:37:50 This was this was always kind of my thing.
00:37:52 Like I always love. Yes, you always love.
00:37:54 I loved I had that book by like, oh God, caffeine killed my family.
00:38:00 Yes, by what's her face?
00:38:01 I don't remember her name.
00:38:02 It was like it was like caffeine killed my family.
00:38:04 The best free cure since Jesus Christ himself.
00:38:08 It's like and it's like it's a little paperback book.
00:38:12 And half of it is like weird anecdotes about how people die if they drink coffee.
00:38:17 And then the rest, the other half of the book is just a list of food items
00:38:21 and how much caffeine is in them.
00:38:24 And it's full, it's full of stories like, so my grandfather drank a coffee a day
00:38:30 and he died at 60.
00:38:32 My father drank two coffees a day and he drew and he died at 30.
00:38:37 So, you know, because he drank twice as much coffee, he died twice as early.
00:38:42 That's why you know that coffee is going to kill you.
00:38:44 You know, I feel I feel for this guy's troubled life.
00:38:47 Funny, because it was a woman.
00:38:49 The guy who died at 30 was run over by a car.
00:38:51 That's how he died.
00:38:52 Yeah, nothing to do with the coffee, but wasn't it though?
00:38:55 Are we sure about that?
00:38:57 No, maybe it's like a sin leader or something.
00:38:59 The most interesting parts of this group's daily life are the parts
00:39:05 that aren't talked about in the podcast a lot, where, Ben, you are in league
00:39:10 with many, many people that I would just find that we could discuss like an entire episode about.
00:39:17 Like, I really like that, because when I see a channel that's done something
00:39:22 that I would have done, I'm just like, oh, man, well, I guess back to the drawing board.
00:39:27 And Ben's like, I got to contact that guy and collaborate.
00:39:32 Like, sometimes, like I like I made I made friends with low art, and I'm on a I'm on a podcast with him now.
00:39:38 That'll probably be out by the time this video is out.
00:39:41 You know, a long run podcast, like a series?
00:39:45 Well, I know I was I was the first guest on his new movie podcast, The Low Cast.
00:39:50 Low Art is a guy, I think he's at like 40 K subs.
00:39:53 He did his break, he did one with Full Metal Alchemist.
00:39:56 But his breakout hit was like a full series overview of Teen Titans,
00:40:00 where he went through like episode by episode being it was called is Teen Titans
00:40:04 2006 as good as we remember.
00:40:06 I remember that. Yeah. Yeah.
00:40:08 It was pretty much the inspiration for my my Poo series.
00:40:11 I was going to ask. Yeah. Yeah.
00:40:13 Yes. More overall.
00:40:15 Thank God. I was worried. I hope I watched the I watched the whole Teen
00:40:19 Titan series because I love Teen Titans as a as a youth.
00:40:22 And it seems like, yeah, it holds up.
00:40:24 Yeah, I remember it being really well.
00:40:27 Yeah, show. Oh, it has a cliffhanger ending.
00:40:30 Yeah. Yeah.
00:40:31 Ending that never gets solved because that stupid terror episode right at the end.
00:40:34 And yeah. Yeah. Right.
00:40:36 Where she remembers. It'll get resolved, though.
00:40:38 I mean, it'll they'll make they'll bring back Teen Titans.
00:40:40 You think they'll bring it back?
00:40:41 I know the question is because even if they bring it back, it will be about that.
00:40:45 Yeah. But will we be happy with what they think the story
00:40:49 about that because they tease it at the end of the Teen Titans go movie.
00:40:52 Yeah. I saw it in theaters.
00:40:54 I didn't try. I mean, that was that was always my thing
00:41:00 because people were always, you know, people have been whining for years and years
00:41:02 about Teen Titans go and I've been saying for years, you idiots.
00:41:07 Teen Titans go is going to bring back the original series.
00:41:10 Just be patient, you fucking morons.
00:41:12 It's a hugely popular show.
00:41:14 It's making the characters popular again.
00:41:16 Yeah. But but if it's more popular than the old one,
00:41:20 doesn't that mean that, like, don't go back to the old one?
00:41:23 Well, you got to remember, you can get into two different wallets this way
00:41:26 because like the kids who want the original, the people complaining about it
00:41:29 only prove that there's a huge audience for the old shit.
00:41:33 Like, I always knew they'd bring it back and I was right.
00:41:35 I'm always right. It's just a curse.
00:41:37 I never thought I'd like Teen Titans go fine.
00:41:41 I don't hate it or anything.
00:41:42 But I would never have thought that they would bring the old one back.
00:41:45 But if they do, I'll be I would really like it.
00:41:48 I want to know what the fuck's up with Tara.
00:41:50 Was she Tara? Was she a look alike?
00:41:52 Was she brainwashed? Was she just pretending?
00:41:54 Was she in the witness protection program?
00:41:56 We just don't know.
00:41:57 I think she was pretending.
00:41:59 I'm going to that's my that's what I does it.
00:42:02 Does it even matter?
00:42:03 Like, frankly, who cares what happened to Tara?
00:42:07 She's, you know, clearly she's alive.
00:42:09 And does it like all that matters is the emotional stakes of Beast Boy,
00:42:14 which I did kind of care about, admittedly.
00:42:16 I'm just in it for the shipping.
00:42:18 I want Beast Boy to get over Tara.
00:42:19 I want Raven to get that sweet green dick.
00:42:22 I want to see it.
00:42:23 It's I've been waiting for it for 20 years.
00:42:28 Nate, I don't I don't understand how you can say that.
00:42:30 It's so weird and mysterious the way that she's just there
00:42:33 and acts like she doesn't know him.
00:42:35 And like, don't you want to know why?
00:42:36 OK, because like because like going on, I think she's so traumatized
00:42:39 that she's just she wants to be done with it.
00:42:41 So she's just telling him, hey, man, I mean, I'd like to know.
00:42:45 I'd like to know the answer.
00:42:47 I guess I guess I don't know.
00:42:49 I'd take more. I'd take more.
00:42:51 Yeah, sure.
00:42:52 I don't think anyone's opposed to having more Teen Titans, right?
00:42:55 I will be very critical, though,
00:42:57 if like they're bringing like new people to make it.
00:42:59 Because, you know, lower.
00:43:01 Lowered is doing a new series about young justice,
00:43:03 but I never watched young justice.
00:43:05 So it's not as good.
00:43:07 I'm sure that like every comment on every video
00:43:10 he made about Teen Titans was, do no young justice next.
00:43:13 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:43:15 Relatively the spiritual successor, I suppose.
00:43:18 I'm always blown aback by how many cartoon shows
00:43:22 people have seen before in their lives.
00:43:24 I don't know if I talked about this before,
00:43:26 but there was a period where I banned cartoons for my life
00:43:29 and an attempt to become an adult, which were too great.
00:43:32 Yeah, yeah, that's when you that's when you look at him now.
00:43:36 Yeah, that's why he that's why he became huge.
00:43:38 That's why he was like six foot eight at 13 years old
00:43:41 because he stopped watching cartoons.
00:43:43 Ironically worked.
00:43:45 But anyway, I always feel like there's been like a real depth
00:43:49 or dearth, I think is the right word of like traditional TV shows
00:43:55 that I've consumed and like traditional
00:43:57 dearth means a lack of, by the way.
00:43:58 Yes, I know.
00:44:00 Yes, it is the right word.
00:44:02 I thought it was the opposite of that, but OK.
00:44:03 No.
00:44:05 So there's not a lot of things that I've seen.
00:44:07 So I haven't like seen, you know, 20 fucking television shows.
00:44:11 Watch the Sopranos.
00:44:12 I can remember like Flapjack.
00:44:13 I can remember Chowder and, you know,
00:44:16 you asked me to name five more and I can't do it.
00:44:18 Like I don't remember.
00:44:19 I feel the opposite.
00:44:20 Holy shit.
00:44:21 How early on did you put this ban on cartoons as soon as I knew
00:44:25 when an adult was fucking hilarious because I have the exact
00:44:32 opposite experience of I have never had any interest in anything
00:44:36 that wasn't a cartoon.
00:44:37 So like, but I also like, I am more inclined to.
00:44:43 It's not that I had anything against cartoons.
00:44:44 It just was that they were kids shit and I had.
00:44:47 Doesn't Homestuck count?
00:44:48 Well, that's why I mean, that's a huge part.
00:44:50 Well, no, I saw I saw live action shows as like four adults.
00:44:55 So I didn't watch them.
00:44:56 And then when I grew up, I realized that they were just shitty
00:45:00 and that I was right all along.
00:45:02 I never drew like a hard line between cartoons
00:45:05 and live action stuff.
00:45:06 But Digi, I was I was way more in your said, like, I as a kid,
00:45:09 I was not like, oh, I want to be an adult.
00:45:12 Like I wanted to stay a kid.
00:45:13 I fucking resented the idea that I would ever be an adult.
00:45:16 I was like, yeah, people used to tell me like, oh, one day
00:45:18 you're not going to like toys anymore.
00:45:20 And I'd be like, fuck you.
00:45:21 I'm fucking hoarding all my toys.
00:45:23 I don't give a shit about toys anymore.
00:45:25 So I also ended up liking girls, which I said I wouldn't.
00:45:29 But that's too bad.
00:45:31 Oh, fuck.
00:45:33 I had the same reaction to you, but only because I
00:45:34 was already an adult.
00:45:35 I said, what do you mean I'm going to grow up and not like it?
00:45:38 Because I'm already grown up.
00:45:39 What do you mean?
00:45:40 I already know.
00:45:42 I feel like the opposite of the same stuff.
00:45:44 They're not saying that I've not cartooned specifically.
00:45:47 It's all media for my childhood.
00:45:49 I'm not connected to it in the same way
00:45:50 that people can point it.
00:45:51 Like, oh, remember Fillmore?
00:45:53 Remember Disney Channel's Fillmore?
00:45:55 And like, what the fuck is the Disney Channel?
00:45:58 Yeah, it's weird because I somehow miss Fillmore.
00:46:00 Didn't we talk about Fillmore last episode?
00:46:02 Yes, you did.
00:46:03 It's like a thing that I saw one episode.
00:46:05 It's about a black guy.
00:46:06 I don't know, but I caught like one episode of it ever.
00:46:10 And I thought it was the coolest shit.
00:46:11 And then I never saw it on TV again.
00:46:13 And I was like, what the fuck was that show?
00:46:15 It's been making the rounds on YouTube
00:46:17 because there's just one quote where this girl is like.
00:46:20 The chicken, right?
00:46:21 Or the turkey?
00:46:22 Yeah, the girl's trying to swindle him.
00:46:23 And then he sees past it.
00:46:25 And then he's like, and by the way, Penny,
00:46:28 that chicken was dry, real dry.
00:46:31 That's right, I know about this show
00:46:33 because I started watching Black YouTube.
00:46:35 And I have two actually, we can bond over that.
00:46:39 Yeah, well, did you see it?
00:46:40 Because there was a video that was a how to black.
00:46:43 Yep, I watched an exact same video maybe three hours ago.
00:46:47 Maybe that's why Fillmore is making the rounds.
00:46:50 It's pretty entertaining.
00:46:51 Is that a video?
00:46:52 I need to get to watching that video
00:46:54 because I don't know how to black.
00:46:55 The funny thing about it, then, is that it's stylistically
00:46:58 very similar to your videos.
00:47:00 Unironically, it feels like a Zenhux-table video almost.
00:47:03 It reminded me of Fillmore and reminded me
00:47:06 that I had always wanted to see more Fillmore.
00:47:09 But I just, because this was like, I didn't have like,
00:47:12 I wasn't internet savvy when I was a little kid
00:47:14 and I saw it on TV.
00:47:15 To clarify, by the way, for Zen,
00:47:17 it's not about how to be black.
00:47:18 It's about how to write black characters in the video.
00:47:20 Yeah, I know.
00:47:22 That was a joke.
00:47:23 Yeah, Zen, you need a fucking lesson.
00:47:26 I don't even know what it's like.
00:47:28 I got a white splay here.
00:47:29 You don't know what it's like to be a black man.
00:47:33 I'm like, it's name only.
00:47:36 I mean, one more, this is one more account
00:47:38 of how YouTube just gives me the same shit.
00:47:39 Because as soon as I watched that, it was like all,
00:47:41 like, I got tons of black YouTube and like, tons of,
00:47:46 just like, because of your videos,
00:47:48 I keep getting these fucking Steven Universe analysis
00:47:50 and I'm like, stop.
00:47:50 Oh, I only made one.
00:47:52 That's terrible.
00:47:53 I made one.
00:47:54 That's terrible.
00:47:56 Don't go down that.
00:47:57 I thought that I had been right.
00:47:58 I have the reputation of being like,
00:48:00 ooh, Steven, you character design suck.
00:48:03 I made one fucking video on it.
00:48:04 Jesus Christ.
00:48:05 Well, my recommendations are because of your video.
00:48:07 No, it's not.
00:48:10 So I thought that I had been recommended How to Black
00:48:12 because I watched that guy, Jack St.
00:48:15 And he had a couple of videos that were like,
00:48:19 it was like looking, okay.
00:48:21 Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:48:22 FYI, I searched ZenHuxdable in YouTube.
00:48:24 The second result is ZenHuxdable Steven Universe,
00:48:27 I swear to God, just saying.
00:48:29 Susan Wojcicki, she fucking hates me.
00:48:32 Is that, no, I'm thinking of Sarah Z.
00:48:35 And by the way, the name of the video
00:48:36 is Stop Making Excuses for the Visual Inconsistencies
00:48:39 of Steven Universe.
00:48:40 So I think I get.
00:48:41 That's not the one I was getting recommendations though.
00:48:43 It's because of his Lily Pete response thing.
00:48:46 Ah, okay, that's the one.
00:48:48 My boy Lily Pete, yeah.
00:48:50 Still kicking it.
00:48:51 You can't say that, you can't, be careful.
00:48:55 I didn't mean to do that, guys.
00:48:57 Okay, look, this is fair, there's a lot of Pete.
00:49:00 You're just cool, there's gonna be a two hour video
00:49:02 on us now.
00:49:03 I just wanna fuck this.
00:49:04 I mean, let's be frank, it would be easier to preserve
00:49:07 the idea of Lily Pete as a woman in your mind
00:49:09 if you don't watch the videos
00:49:11 and hear a male-sounding voice coming at you
00:49:14 for hours and hours and hours, you know?
00:49:15 Oh, let's not, let's not.
00:49:17 Yeah, no, I just stood in front of the mirror.
00:49:20 There's people like, what the what, for example,
00:49:21 who have a girl avatar, who definitely,
00:49:24 I'm pretty sure they're not trans or whatever,
00:49:27 but they just have a girl avatar.
00:49:28 That's the same thing Lily Pete does,
00:49:30 only I guess Lily Pete is legitimately trans or something.
00:49:33 How am I supposed to know the difference?
00:49:34 I just had this picture of Lily Pete on my wall
00:49:37 and I just kept on repeating girl, girl, girl, girl, girl,
00:49:40 girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl.
00:49:42 Your enemy's on your wall, just like me, I knew it.
00:49:45 You're more like fucking silly Pete.
00:49:50 Stephen, your personality isn't fear-aided,
00:49:52 it makes me so mad because every single video
00:49:54 is either like, there's no normal porridge,
00:49:59 there's no just right video, it's all just like,
00:50:01 I see, I hear what you're saying,
00:50:03 and I think I agree with you,
00:50:05 but you're just so fucking rude and stupid and gay.
00:50:08 I made one, I made multiple.
00:50:11 Yeah, I was gonna say, I like Jesse's,
00:50:12 I remember liking Jesse's.
00:50:14 I don't remember, but.
00:50:15 Here's the, here's the.
00:50:16 I made the one, I made the one Steven Universe video
00:50:19 that was a parody of all the shit.
00:50:22 Yes, yes, and it was so spot on, it was so spot on.
00:50:25 Even before that, I made a video about one of the seasons,
00:50:28 a serialized video, in fact, if anyone remembers that old
00:50:31 series, it did like a real review on the season of Steven Universe.
00:50:34 I wanna know what Hippo was gonna say
00:50:36 because he had the chance to speak at all.
00:50:38 Oh yeah.
00:50:40 Oh no, I had nothing to say, I was just trying to fit
00:50:42 a zinger in there.
00:50:43 Oh no.
00:50:45 Well no, Gib was right, the only review
00:50:47 that you need to make is that Steven Universe is good,
00:50:49 and I basically agree.
00:50:51 Yes, I've wished.
00:50:53 Season one recently, and the beginning of season two,
00:50:55 season one is perfect.
00:50:57 For anyone not privy to my content,
00:50:59 I just wanna establish that I don't hate Steven Universe.
00:51:02 Okay.
00:51:03 You just hate women, lesbians, gay people.
00:51:06 Absolutely, thank you.
00:51:07 Thank you for the elaboration.
00:51:09 I bet if you did that, I bet if you just,
00:51:11 I bet if you just made a video called Steven Universe is good,
00:51:15 and you just said like, the reasons the show is good,
00:51:18 and didn't even mention the reasons anyone hates it,
00:51:21 you would get massive thumbs down,
00:51:22 you would be like downvoted to oblivion,
00:51:24 people would come, we're gating the video,
00:51:26 calling you a piece of shit in a cock
00:51:28 and a libtard propagandist.
00:51:32 That's an experiment that I wanna run.
00:51:33 There's something that's going on around the viewer.
00:51:34 I'm gonna make that video.
00:51:35 Steven Universe is good, the video.
00:51:37 I have a video from way back in the day
00:51:39 about Steven Universe, where it was universally popular.
00:51:41 I mean we just did episode.
00:51:42 I don't remember any huge blowback from it,
00:51:44 but maybe it's because it was before the storm.
00:51:48 I think the worm has turned.
00:51:50 I think the worm has turned on Steven Universe
00:51:52 and it's become popular to shit on it.
00:51:53 It's really funny that he said that, Jesse,
00:51:55 because the people who are shitting on the show
00:51:57 the most right now are SJWs.
00:51:59 Like, they are shitting on the show
00:52:01 because they're insisting that it's like,
00:52:02 I've said, I've said for a long time
00:52:05 that Steven Universe is not gay enough.
00:52:07 Well, no, it's not that, they're saying that it's like,
00:52:10 oh fuck, does that mean you can explain this better
00:52:12 than I can? They're not biologically female,
00:52:13 they are fucking light holograms, they don't even fuck.
00:52:16 Okay. Well, everyone's an SJW.
00:52:19 I mean, most of the videos I see are by alt-right SJWs.
00:52:22 Well, that's true.
00:52:23 Saying the show's too gay.
00:52:24 Basically, the gripe that people were having
00:52:25 with the show is that the messaging was like,
00:52:28 this is a fascist like the diamonds.
00:52:29 And basically, the gripe that people had
00:52:33 was that the text in the show was
00:52:37 that they were being forgiving to fascists.
00:52:40 Ah, okay. I think so, fucking man.
00:52:41 God, I hate people who care about shit.
00:52:43 I just fucking, I'm so sick of people thinking
00:52:46 that their opinion matters on anything.
00:52:49 Hey, guys, Kingdom Hearts 3 has a lot of cool stuff.
00:52:54 I really like it.
00:52:55 Oh, wait, before we go on that, I wanted to say something.
00:52:57 I wanted to say that the reason I thought
00:52:59 I got recommended How To Black
00:53:01 was because I had been watching this guy, Jack St,
00:53:03 who did a, he did two videos.
00:53:07 Well, that's for the bonus episode,
00:53:10 we'll talk about that maybe.
00:53:12 But Jack St, he did these two videos looking at like,
00:53:16 black.com is unique quality content.
00:53:18 90s, like gender, like trans representation,
00:53:21 or like, or no, gay in stuff representation
00:53:24 in 90s media, because the feeling,
00:53:27 like the sentiment is that the 90s was full of cartoons
00:53:30 and stuff that had lots of like gay representation.
00:53:33 So he went back and he looked through it.
00:53:35 And basically the conclusion was like,
00:53:37 with only a couple of exceptions,
00:53:39 like yeah, there are characters who are like coded gay,
00:53:42 but they're all, like almost all of them
00:53:43 are like the butt of a joke.
00:53:44 And it's not really, yeah, like it's not really,
00:53:47 it's not really as progressive as people tend to remember.
00:53:50 They're in the show, but like,
00:53:51 how are they being portrayed?
00:53:52 People think they were gay characters in 90s cartoons.
00:53:55 I don't remember that ever, in my case.
00:53:57 To be fair though, when they say that,
00:53:58 they mean like him from Powerpuff Girls.
00:54:01 Okay, sure, when you're on the mark.
00:54:03 Who is literally Satan also.
00:54:05 I'm pretty sure that him is just supposed to,
00:54:07 him is just like supposed to be the Rocky Horror character.
00:54:11 Yeah, he's Tim Curry, he's just Tim Curry or whatever.
00:54:13 Well, yeah, he's like a combination of.
00:54:15 How much more fucking coded gay can you get?
00:54:17 That's not coded gay though.
00:54:19 That's just a sweet transvestite from trans fucking Fabania.
00:54:23 He's like a bisexual or something.
00:54:25 It's not coded at all, it's right there.
00:54:27 I mean, it's all in the same melange.
00:54:29 Well, I'm just trying to say that like.
00:54:31 Fuck that boy pussy.
00:54:32 The point of it is not that he's like gay
00:54:35 and that's why he's evil.
00:54:36 I think he's just a combination of Tim Curry's Labyrinth
00:54:39 and Rocky Horror characters, you know?
00:54:42 You mean, it wasn't Tim Curry in Labyrinth, it was,
00:54:44 was it Bowie?
00:54:45 David Bowie was Bowie, yeah.
00:54:46 Tim Curry plays the devil in that, doesn't he?
00:54:48 It's not Labyrinth,
00:54:49 but I know you're talking about it, something.
00:54:50 Is it Labyrinth?
00:54:51 Okay, whatever.
00:54:52 I know there is another movie where Tim Curry plays.
00:54:54 Wait, wait, wait.
00:54:55 He's got like crazy makeup.
00:54:56 Is this like, look, I mean, is it, wow,
00:54:58 newsflash before a thing was like socially acceptable
00:55:02 on a widespread degree, people like were critical of it.
00:55:05 Oh my God, what a shocker.
00:55:07 No, no, but like a lot of people have this idea
00:55:10 that cartoons in the 90s were like,
00:55:12 we're like pushing a gay agenda.
00:55:14 Okay.
00:55:15 Oh, okay.
00:55:15 Yeah, yeah.
00:55:16 Oh, so it's, okay.
00:55:17 I thought the, I thought you were saying.
00:55:19 Yeah, by including things like him.
00:55:21 I thought you were saying that people had the impression
00:55:23 that cartoons from the 90s were like positively pushing.
00:55:27 Yeah, yeah.
00:55:27 Yeah, yeah, they do.
00:55:29 Yeah, yeah, I've never heard that.
00:55:30 Okay, I guess what I'm saying is that I thought
00:55:32 that the people who thought that were the other people.
00:55:35 You know what I mean?
00:55:36 Oh God, I'm fucking lost.
00:55:38 I thought you were trying to say
00:55:39 that people were praising 90s cartoons
00:55:41 for having more gay representation.
00:55:43 No, that's why I was confused.
00:55:45 If you tell me that it's conservative people saying like,
00:55:47 oh yeah, cartoons back then really pushed the gay agenda.
00:55:50 That's the case, there was no need for a video about that
00:55:52 because those people are obviously fucking wrong.
00:55:55 And like, no one remembers it that way.
00:55:57 There were a couple, there were a couple of examples
00:56:00 like Robot Jones had an episode
00:56:02 that was like actually about the issue
00:56:05 and not treating it as a joke.
00:56:06 Nobody watched fucking whatever happened to Robot Jones.
00:56:09 I certainly did not watch whatever
00:56:11 I had ever watched.
00:56:12 Oh, okay, yeah.
00:56:13 I fucking watched it.
00:56:13 Did ever happen.
00:56:14 That's why I was interested.
00:56:15 That's why it was interesting
00:56:17 because I'd never fucking heard of this shit.
00:56:18 Whatever happened to Robot Jones,
00:56:20 I've not heard that name in many years.
00:56:23 The name was a hell of a bill of prostitutes.
00:56:24 That was like one of the first cartoon cartoon shows, I think.
00:56:27 Yeah.
00:56:29 The show famous because it had gay.
00:56:30 I don't know about pushing the gay agenda,
00:56:32 but I'm certainly pulling the gay agenda.
00:56:34 Like hand jobs, if you know what I'm saying.
00:56:37 We'll talk about that on the bonus episode.
00:56:39 My mic is phallic.
00:56:41 Can you guess what I'm doing?
00:56:42 Listen, we can be gay coded all you want,
00:56:45 but unless I'm sucking your dick, you're not gay enough.
00:56:48 That's all I'm trying to say.
00:56:50 Yeah, for sure.
00:56:51 Speaking of gay.
00:56:52 Well, about that Kingdom Hearts 3.
00:56:54 Yeah, exactly, exactly.
00:56:56 Kingdom Hearts 3 pushed the gay agenda.
00:56:58 I sure hope so.
00:56:59 You know what?
00:57:00 I haven't beaten it and I don't think Gibb has either.
00:57:01 Is that accurate?
00:57:02 Final Fantasy has way too many like fucking anime people
00:57:05 I just want to see Donald and Mickey.
00:57:09 You know, the funny thing about that is.
00:57:10 You see Donald and Mickey and Goofy.
00:57:12 Do you?
00:57:13 Oh, yes.
00:57:14 It's funny you say that.
00:57:15 You could have loved Mickey actually.
00:57:16 I played Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts 3.
00:57:17 I don't know anything about it.
00:57:19 I played those games in spite of Donald and Goofy.
00:57:21 I just wanted to say that I like Mickey Mouse.
00:57:24 I have no opinion on Kingdom Hearts.
00:57:25 It's a great series.
00:57:26 I love it.
00:57:27 As a person who did not grow up with Kingdom Hearts,
00:57:30 I have not been waiting for it for like a decade.
00:57:34 I played the Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 kind of recently
00:57:39 and I always thought it was stupid
00:57:41 because it was combining Disney and Final Fantasy
00:57:45 and also has edgy stuff.
00:57:47 It's a fair assessment.
00:57:49 That was correct.
00:57:49 Upon playing them, I have discovered that it is stupid
00:57:52 but it is also really funny and I love it.
00:57:55 If every time Mickey Mouse talks about the world of darkness,
00:57:58 it means it's really like Mickey Mouse voice
00:58:01 with his like dark hood over him.
00:58:04 It's the funniest, coolest stuff of all time.
00:58:06 I think that Kingdom Hearts,
00:58:07 I wouldn't even have had ever had any problem with it
00:58:09 or assumed anything bad about it or negative
00:58:11 or thought it was dumb if not for the fucking trench coats
00:58:15 of the Organization 13,
00:58:16 which are the worst design I've ever seen.
00:58:19 I agree.
00:58:20 They look cool on the Organization guys.
00:58:21 No, they don't.
00:58:23 They look so bad.
00:58:25 Those trench coats are the ugliest trench coats
00:58:27 I've ever seen.
00:58:28 They're not the ugliest trench coats.
00:58:29 They're real edgy.
00:58:30 They're very hot topic but they don't look good.
00:58:32 They're beyond hot topic guys.
00:58:33 They're really badness.
00:58:34 They don't.
00:58:36 Yeah, I mean they're like,
00:58:37 they're like goth wave clothes.
00:58:38 No, I want to hear it.
00:58:40 Did you, what do you think was bad?
00:58:41 I'm with didgy on this.
00:58:41 I hate those fucking guys.
00:58:43 They look ridiculous.
00:58:44 As a guy who-
00:58:44 I don't, I listen.
00:58:46 I love them.
00:58:46 I know, I know.
00:58:48 But the thing is,
00:58:49 I don't believe that you actually think that.
00:58:52 What?
00:58:54 What do you mean?
00:58:55 Because it doesn't make any fucking sense.
00:58:57 Let me clarify.
00:58:58 I am a guy who wore a trench coat through all of high school.
00:59:01 I am a trench coat enthusiast.
00:59:03 Oh, so this makes you cringe.
00:59:04 I don't like that.
00:59:05 Just thinking back to it, that's why.
00:59:07 Hold on, I'm trying to look at-
00:59:08 You're not getting proper representation
00:59:10 in your media and you're upset about it.
00:59:10 I'm gonna give you a full breakdown.
00:59:11 I gotta look at a picture of it.
00:59:13 Okay, oh my god.
00:59:14 I know there's lots of weird zippers and layers and stuff.
00:59:16 First of all, I hate the weird, overly closed hood.
00:59:20 I hate the whole look of the chest is ugly.
00:59:23 I hate that they go all the way down
00:59:25 and then they have a zipper coming up from the bottom.
00:59:29 That's stupid.
00:59:30 There's a bunch of different versions of this Google search.
00:59:33 Just Google Xemnas, you'll see him
00:59:36 in the full thing like floating
00:59:37 and you get a good look at the whole thing.
00:59:39 Google Organization 13, there's one of a generic.
00:59:41 I don't know.
00:59:42 You can't see his face.
00:59:43 I've just always found them really ugly.
00:59:45 In fact, when I used to go to anime conventions,
00:59:49 it would be fucking everywhere.
00:59:51 It's like giant groups of people wearing the trench coats
00:59:54 and the hair looks bad enough in the games,
00:59:58 does not translate to reality at all.
01:00:01 First of all, it looks absolutely fantastic in the games.
01:00:05 It's anime hair.
01:00:06 Anime hair doesn't look good in reality.
01:00:09 Like the one you just posted in the chat of Xenohort,
01:00:13 I really dislike.
01:00:14 Why?
01:00:15 This is one of the best designs of all time.
01:00:19 Did you consistently say Xenohort and it's Xehanort?
01:00:22 Xehanort?
01:00:23 Even Xehanort.
01:00:24 This is Xemnas, god damn it.
01:00:25 His name is Xemnas.
01:00:27 He's the nobody in Xehanort.
01:00:28 Have you possessed Terra's body, god damn it?
01:00:30 The problem here is that Digi is realizing something
01:00:35 that he doesn't have the courage to fully articulate,
01:00:38 which is that anime sucks and is gay.
01:00:42 The entire anime aesthetic is just wrong and bad.
01:00:44 I think there's something to what you're saying, Jesse.
01:00:45 Anime is bad.
01:00:46 I don't know any anime that looks like this, though.
01:00:48 Like, I don't know any fucking line.
01:00:50 I don't know Bleach.
01:00:51 They don't wear-
01:00:52 This is clearly anime stuff.
01:00:54 This is why the trench coat looks bad.
01:00:56 Like, I understand looking at this.
01:00:59 It's the fact that the sleeves are, like, flared
01:01:04 and also that the material is not, like, leather.
01:01:08 It's sort of like a plasticky, shiny, weird thing.
01:01:10 No, it's heavy leather, god damn it.
01:01:12 It looks sick.
01:01:13 It does not look like leather.
01:01:14 It looks like, like-
01:01:16 I'm really into this image that Xen just linked.
01:01:18 This is my favorite.
01:01:20 I hate it.
01:01:21 I think the main thing about it-
01:01:22 Leave Jiren to me, Goku.
01:01:24 Who the fuck is Jiren?
01:01:26 He's fucking the alimau from Dragon Ball 2.
01:01:29 Is he the cat?
01:01:30 No, he's the super jacked gray alien.
01:01:34 Okay, I figured out who's the best character.
01:01:36 I figured out everything I hate about this trench coat.
01:01:37 First of all, the biggest problem really is that it's so tight
01:01:40 in the midsection.
01:01:41 Oh, he wants to do-
01:01:42 To emphasize his manly figure, god damn it.
01:01:45 He looks awesome.
01:01:46 He's a fucking stupid fucking Jiren.
01:01:49 He's a big buff baby boy.
01:01:50 He's a vital boss.
01:01:51 He's really terrible.
01:01:52 Jiren is awesome.
01:01:53 He's a tough-toothed baby who can dance like a man.
01:01:56 Ew.
01:01:57 This isn't-
01:01:58 Wait, is this a new Dragon Ball?
01:02:00 The cat thing was weird-looking, but in a good way.
01:02:01 You fucking dance on your corpse.
01:02:02 The cat thing was weird-looking, but in a good way.
01:02:04 This isn't a bad way.
01:02:05 No, Jiren is good-
01:02:06 Okay, first of all, please be aware.
01:02:08 This is literally-
01:02:09 He's fucking Star Trek, look.
01:02:11 Yeah, he is.
01:02:12 He is literally Captain Picard.
01:02:13 This is the most powerful entity in all of Dragon Ball.
01:02:16 This alimau, gray muscle alien piece of shit.
01:02:19 Wait, I thought the strongest entity
01:02:21 was like the little old man or whatever, or like-
01:02:24 Well, yeah, that's God.
01:02:25 Did they-
01:02:25 Oh, that was a red herring.
01:02:26 Okay, that's Lord of the Rings.
01:02:27 How many times are they gonna introduce
01:02:28 the new strongest beings?
01:02:29 No, no.
01:02:30 God damn it, I actually watched the series.
01:02:32 I know the answer.
01:02:33 As long as the series goes on,
01:02:34 they're gonna keep doing that.
01:02:35 Jesse knows.
01:02:36 That's the show.
01:02:37 Jesse knows.
01:02:37 The guy that Digi's talking about, Lord Zeno, is God.
01:02:40 There is none higher than him.
01:02:41 But like, there are multiple universes.
01:02:43 Although they did make the second Lord of the Universe.
01:02:44 There's like 12 universes.
01:02:44 There were two of them?
01:02:45 And Jiren is the most powerful dude
01:02:47 in one of the universes.
01:02:50 I don't think he's as powerful as the little boy.
01:02:53 Oh my God.
01:02:53 Lord Zeno is so cool.
01:02:55 Yeah, I just-
01:02:56 What are you talking about?
01:02:57 No, I love Lord Zeno.
01:02:59 Lord Zeno is the shit.
01:03:00 He's the coolest.
01:03:01 I fucking love him.
01:03:03 He's so cute.
01:03:04 Yeah, he's rad.
01:03:07 These are all the show notes, people.
01:03:09 Lord Zeno looks like shit.
01:03:11 No, shut the hell up and get out of here.
01:03:13 There's fucking Final Fantasy,
01:03:15 there's fucking Kingdom Hearts,
01:03:18 heaven let your light shine down.
01:03:20 A hoodie looks really funny.
01:03:23 This color scheme is so close
01:03:24 of the supporting trans rights.
01:03:26 I don't understand it.
01:03:27 Lord Zeno is a character that I invented.
01:03:30 I respect him.
01:03:32 I like Lord Zeno.
01:03:33 I'm not a fan of the other guy.
01:03:35 I'm not a fan of the G.
01:03:36 Okay, Digi, I still don't understand
01:03:40 why you don't like the Kingdom Hearts 13 or trans guys.
01:03:42 Well, I changed it to mine.
01:03:43 Step by step.
01:03:44 Okay, I want to hear.
01:03:45 I do want to hear.
01:03:46 All right, first of all,
01:03:47 the fact that it hugs so tight
01:03:49 in the midsection looks really uncomfortable.
01:03:51 That's why it looks cool.
01:03:53 That's, I'm not a fan of that.
01:03:54 Second of all.
01:03:55 No, that's just effeminate.
01:03:57 It's fashion.
01:03:58 It's fashion.
01:03:59 I really hate that they unzip from the bottom up.
01:04:03 Like, what?
01:04:04 That's stupid.
01:04:05 Oh yeah, that's a little weird.
01:04:06 That is weird.
01:04:07 Have you never seen a double zipper?
01:04:10 It can unzip from both sides.
01:04:11 But it goes all the way to the top.
01:04:12 So we'd have to lean all the way down.
01:04:16 You're assuming they would unzip off.
01:04:18 It's not all the way zipped down.
01:04:20 It's fashion number one.
01:04:22 I'm just wondering, like, when I look at it,
01:04:24 I can't help but think, like, which way does he go
01:04:26 to take it off?
01:04:27 Does he just go up and like...
01:04:28 He pulls up, goddammit.
01:04:29 I think he's designed to be over from the top.
01:04:31 It's a double-sided zipper.
01:04:33 He only has it pulled down as far as his hand
01:04:35 can comfortably reach.
01:04:36 It's style and functionality.
01:04:38 If you think of the power of the Organization 13,
01:04:42 they could probably use telepathy to move a zip
01:04:44 without having to bend over.
01:04:46 They'd just do their little hand motions, like...
01:04:49 Axl can just, like, shoot fire at it
01:04:51 and make it, like, you know, move with that or something.
01:04:54 You just blast it with, like, flour.
01:04:55 I'm also just not a fan of this, like, all flat black aesthetic,
01:04:59 like, nothing.
01:04:59 It's matte black, and it looks dope.
01:05:02 Matte black is for technology.
01:05:03 It's not for clothes.
01:05:05 I disagree.
01:05:07 Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:05:08 OK, I just Googled Organization 13.
01:05:11 Are all these characters, like, real?
01:05:12 Like, are they actually in the game?
01:05:14 They're in the game.
01:05:15 No matter what the question is, yes.
01:05:17 OK.
01:05:18 Whatever you want.
01:05:19 It's such a bad series.
01:05:21 It's so terrible in every way.
01:05:24 Look, look, we all know it's dead,
01:05:26 but they've just released the last one.
01:05:27 None of us have beaten it yet.
01:05:29 Like, it's getting put to bed, like, today.
01:05:31 You know, I bought it, like, this weekend.
01:05:33 I bought Kingdom Hearts, like, thinking that I wanted it,
01:05:36 because, you know, I grew up playing the original games
01:05:39 back in the day.
01:05:40 Did you play the sequels to two, all those other ones?
01:05:42 I played one and two when it came out.
01:05:44 And so, you know, I bought my Kingdom Hearts 3
01:05:46 and I took it home.
01:05:48 And then I looked at it and, like, I don't want this.
01:05:50 I don't even want to fucking put it in.
01:05:52 You'd like it.
01:05:53 This is Kingdom Hearts is fucking stupid.
01:05:55 Like, I just realized all at once.
01:05:56 You would love running around with it.
01:05:58 I just suddenly realized.
01:05:59 I suddenly realized.
01:06:00 And having great Toy Story adventures looking for Andy.
01:06:02 I suddenly realized that I've always hated the series
01:06:05 and just I never, I never knew.
01:06:08 I wouldn't admit it until I had the game in my possession.
01:06:11 This is why I mentioned earlier
01:06:13 that I had not grown up with Kingdom Hearts,
01:06:16 because, like, I bought it as soon as it was available.
01:06:18 And I have been having a lot of fun with it,
01:06:22 because it is a new PS2 game in 2019.
01:06:26 I've been waiting for a long time
01:06:28 to be able to play another PS2 game.
01:06:30 It plays exactly like Kingdom Hearts 2,
01:06:32 little different, you know, with, like, more stuff in it.
01:06:35 But, like, it's colorful.
01:06:37 It's got, like, crazy cartoony characters
01:06:39 that are stupid and funny and cool.
01:06:41 And the story is, like, it's for babies,
01:06:44 and I really like it.
01:06:45 I mean, it's not, like, a shit game.
01:06:47 I have heard something.
01:06:49 The guttons are unwatchable in the first three years.
01:06:52 Most of them are.
01:06:53 Some of them, like, are surprisingly, like, oh,
01:06:55 that feels like it was, like, directed or, like,
01:06:57 was taken from, like, like that, they, like, I don't know.
01:07:02 I'll just say that, uh...
01:07:03 Looked at a human being, like, I have a conversation
01:07:06 and, like, animated it like it was a person.
01:07:08 It's like, that was okay, but a lot of it is, like, awful.
01:07:11 You know what I was wondering?
01:07:12 I just, I don't know what...
01:07:13 Is there some mandate?
01:07:15 Is there some reason why they had to make every,
01:07:19 like, every conversation and every, like, cutscene,
01:07:22 like, paste so awkwardly with weird pauses between speech?
01:07:27 That's why there's stuff on the board.
01:07:28 Like, is this a thing where, like,
01:07:29 because they translate from Japanese to English,
01:07:31 there's, like, tons of dead space left?
01:07:33 I, like, why did they do that?
01:07:35 I would imagine so.
01:07:36 Yeah, but, like...
01:07:37 Yeah, but there's so many, there's so many dubs out there
01:07:40 that are good and localized really well.
01:07:42 Exactly, that's what I'm saying, right.
01:07:43 You can edit any cutscene down, you can just cut bits.
01:07:46 You're playing, like, background music.
01:07:47 There's no audio, like, to worry about.
01:07:49 Yeah, I know you mean.
01:07:50 I have no patience for that weird,
01:07:52 stilted Asian anime bullshit.
01:07:54 So is it, like, is it...
01:07:55 So is it just, like, directed like that
01:07:57 from the get-go or something or what?
01:07:59 It has always been like that, yes, absolutely.
01:08:01 And I don't know why.
01:08:03 Like, I guess it does feel more video game-y,
01:08:06 AKA shit.
01:08:07 Like, I should be pushing X-men right now.
01:08:09 It's not a good thing to have those parts, yeah.
01:08:11 But yeah, it's just bad though.
01:08:12 And, like, they could fix this.
01:08:14 You could just cut out these little chunks of waiting.
01:08:17 I don't know, it's baffling to me.
01:08:19 Why the fuck did it?
01:08:20 I don't know, I like it.
01:08:21 I mean, I don't like it, I don't think it's good,
01:08:23 but, like, it just feels fun.
01:08:26 Like, it feels just, like, it feels like it should
01:08:29 as a Kingdom Hearts game.
01:08:30 And I already know what I was getting myself
01:08:32 to do when I bought it.
01:08:32 I don't know, like, I know what I did.
01:08:33 I'm sure people can play the game.
01:08:36 I've been informed of something in my comments
01:08:38 that has greatly disturbed me
01:08:40 and made me even less excited to play the game
01:08:44 than I already was, which is that
01:08:46 there are no Final Fantasy characters in this one at all.
01:08:49 Is that true?
01:08:50 That's what I have heard, that's what I have heard.
01:08:52 What is the point of the series then?
01:08:55 It's all, it's, what the fuck, why?
01:08:57 Look, the presence of Final Fantasy,
01:08:59 look, obviously, it leads with Disney.
01:09:01 The presence of Final Fantasy-
01:09:02 Nothing would be in it.
01:09:03 I, me too.
01:09:04 The presence of Final Fantasy has always been
01:09:06 kind of a more thematic press.
01:09:08 I mean, it's always been bad.
01:09:09 They've always done the Final Fantasy stuff badly,
01:09:11 but it's like the whole genesis of the series.
01:09:14 It's part of it.
01:09:14 You guys gotta understand, this is the new Square Enix.
01:09:17 You're gonna have to download the Final Fantasy 7 DLC pack
01:09:21 to get the ex-
01:09:23 I, unironically, think that's, look,
01:09:24 I haven't beaten the game yet.
01:09:25 I've heard this from people that, like, DLC and, like,
01:09:29 like, end game content is, like, zilch,
01:09:31 and that it will be, like, patched or it'll be DLC
01:09:33 or maybe, like, they'll make a Final Mix version of the game.
01:09:36 I hear something like that is coming.
01:09:37 I can't confirm it yet.
01:09:39 But, like, yo, the, like, at the very least,
01:09:42 Leon, Yuffie, Eris, and even Cloud and Sephiroth
01:09:45 have been in every game as actual characters
01:09:48 that we care about in Kingdom Hearts Lore.
01:09:51 Why in God's name would we not, like,
01:09:54 address those characters in Kingdom Hearts 3
01:09:57 unless they just, like, ran out of dev time?
01:09:59 And besides that-
01:10:01 The best part of every game is the Sephiroth fight.
01:10:04 You go find him, he's hanging out on a cliff somewhere
01:10:07 and you go, I'm gonna fight ya and he's gonna go,
01:10:08 well, I'm gonna suck Cloud's dick once you kick my ass
01:10:10 and so then you fight him and it's hard and it's fun.
01:10:15 I'm mad. It's fun, though.
01:10:16 It's just good.
01:10:17 I mean, sure, the story is terrible.
01:10:18 It's just, like, where's Cloud?
01:10:19 I don't know.
01:10:20 Fight me. Okay.
01:10:21 Beat him. Get Cloud.
01:10:22 Okay.
01:10:23 That's how it goes every single time.
01:10:25 But it, like, it's just, it's,
01:10:29 the thing about Kingdom Hearts 3,
01:10:30 this is my observation.
01:10:31 It's that it is bizarrely, like, in depth
01:10:35 and bizarrely large amounts of effort
01:10:37 were put into some aspects.
01:10:39 If you get to, like, the Toy Story world,
01:10:41 there's, like, a whole fucking-
01:10:42 They, like, made a second game within Kingdom Hearts 3
01:10:46 that's, like, clearly a parody of Final Fantasy-style games
01:10:50 like Final Fantasy XV that, like, exists within,
01:10:52 within the Kingdom Hearts universe,
01:10:54 within the Toy Story universe, exists this universe.
01:10:56 It's bizarre, but it's dope.
01:10:58 But, like, so that had insane amounts of effort
01:11:01 and energy put into it.
01:11:02 Like, but where the fuck are my Final Fantasy characters?
01:11:05 Why is that just, like, not here at all?
01:11:08 At all?
01:11:09 I don't understand the weird lopsidedness
01:11:12 of the, like, emphasis of the development.
01:11:14 Is it because they're gonna fill it out later?
01:11:15 Is this more Final Fantasy XV syndrome
01:11:17 of they just didn't finish the game that they wanted to?
01:11:20 Because the fact that we don't see Leon
01:11:22 and those other boys that have been in every game
01:11:24 as, like, vital buddies of ours is bizarre.
01:11:28 What if it's because they want you to think,
01:11:32 well, shit, if I want to see all the Final Fantasy characters
01:11:35 interact, I'm gonna have to buy Dissidia?
01:11:39 I mean, that's true, except there's no story
01:11:42 in the new Dissidia, none.
01:11:44 You'd have to play the PSP games from 10 years ago.
01:11:48 So you got nothing.
01:11:49 They're not giving us what we need.
01:11:50 We're in expense.
01:11:51 Sounds like hate and all.
01:11:52 Okay, most fucking games.
01:11:55 Most important questions.
01:11:56 What another fucking thing?
01:11:57 Why the hell hasn't Donald Duck
01:11:59 who's turned my voicemails?
01:12:01 Why the fuck does Donald Duck
01:12:02 give these up both?
01:12:03 And he's gonna have to respond
01:12:05 to all the various emails I sent him.
01:12:07 I want to collab with you, Donald Duck.
01:12:09 I want to know what's in your mind.
01:12:11 I want to be on my interview show.
01:12:14 Donald Duck, why do you not think it's okay
01:12:16 for you to just ignore me?
01:12:17 Like all the other people that you just fucking then kill
01:12:20 and stuff in a dead ditch in Africa.
01:12:22 Why do you think you can treat me like the way
01:12:23 you treat all your horrors and your hookers?
01:12:25 I've known that Donald Duck is not
01:12:27 in Tales Get Strolled, Munchie, for the last time.
01:12:30 And another thing, why the fuck is there not
01:12:32 a goof troupe level and a DuckTales level
01:12:34 in Kingdom Hearts?
01:12:35 There really should be.
01:12:37 Goofy and Donald kind of got the shaft
01:12:39 in terms of their development.
01:12:40 I mean, I'm glad Scrooge is in it.
01:12:41 I love Scrooge.
01:12:42 Scrooge is there, yeah.
01:12:43 He's good.
01:12:44 He's a good guy.
01:12:45 I don't know the thing.
01:12:46 What's the deal with that Kingdom Hearts story?
01:12:49 It's so weird.
01:12:50 Why is it so convoluted?
01:12:52 And how come the games are all on one?
01:12:55 They have such weird names.
01:12:56 There's decimals in there and numbers and fractions
01:13:00 and the names of the games.
01:13:01 I don't know how to read it.
01:13:02 I don't understand.
01:13:04 OK.
01:13:04 How do you even pronounce Xenor?
01:13:07 That's my new character.
01:13:08 Guy who doesn't understand Kingdom Hearts lore.
01:13:10 But the best, every most important question,
01:13:14 who's the best organization 13?
01:13:16 Answer, Seix, Dunn.
01:13:17 Xemnas, it's Xemnas.
01:13:18 Mark Xen, you freaks, you fools, you gays.
01:13:21 But there are keyblades, and then there
01:13:25 are, get ready for it, keyblades.
01:13:28 Keyblades.
01:13:29 No, I won't let you mock that.
01:13:31 That's an actual hilarious joke from our lecture
01:13:33 that we all made together.
01:13:35 And I won't let you soil it.
01:13:36 That's culture.
01:13:37 People now do that.
01:13:39 They go, keyblade.
01:13:40 Keyblade, yep.
01:13:43 I don't do it.
01:13:43 I mean, has your, I gotta imagine.
01:13:46 You were there, Jesse.
01:13:47 What?
01:13:49 Has your video, how the views of your video,
01:13:51 have they spiked?
01:13:53 Have they spiked with the release of three?
01:13:54 Yes, they have spiked.
01:13:56 It's still sitting at around something like
01:13:58 three, two, four hundred, like thousand views.
01:14:01 Which like for a video that,
01:14:03 I mean, I'm not trying to toot my own horn,
01:14:04 but for a video that's like fairly well known,
01:14:06 such as that, those are relatively low numbers.
01:14:08 It's not like it's surging about like
01:14:10 hundreds of thousands, like every month or whatever.
01:14:12 But like, people are coming back to it,
01:14:14 they're watching again, and it's certainly,
01:14:16 like, again, not to suck my own dick too hard,
01:14:19 but like, it was the primordial,
01:14:22 let's explain the crazy Kingdom Hearts lore video
01:14:25 that many people are copying right now.
01:14:27 And by the way, I was gonna say this before,
01:14:29 but let me say it now.
01:14:30 So Barry Kramer, former editor of Game Grumps,
01:14:34 made a video.
01:14:35 I saw this on your stream.
01:14:36 I was watching your stream.
01:14:38 Really, really quick tangent.
01:14:42 Ross follows me on Instagram, that's it.
01:14:45 Oh, dope.
01:14:47 That's cool, that's cool.
01:14:49 I fucking hate Ross.
01:14:50 Oh, well, there you go.
01:14:52 It's fine, because he's fucking,
01:14:54 I don't know, he's just, he's annoying.
01:14:55 But he's outside of the context of him
01:14:58 trying to be funny on Game Grumps.
01:15:00 When he's talking about animation and stuff, he's,
01:15:03 he's really good.
01:15:04 He's still annoying.
01:15:05 He's still annoying.
01:15:06 I don't like the stuff he makes.
01:15:08 He's annoying.
01:15:09 Everyone ever involved with the Game Grumps,
01:15:11 they're all cool, please give me a job.
01:15:13 Deliver me from the procrastinators
01:15:15 and give me a real job.
01:15:16 But, Hating Ross made it really satisfying
01:15:20 when he was straight up the villain
01:15:21 of that World of Warcraft series they did.
01:15:23 That was a really great series.
01:15:24 Wasn't he the one trying to like,
01:15:25 help everybody have fun and, you know.
01:15:27 Well, sort of, but he does a terrible job
01:15:29 and is an idiot and ruins it for everyone.
01:15:33 Okay, well let me, let me finish my point about Barry.
01:15:35 It's, it's just that,
01:15:36 so Barry is one of these pretenders to the throne.
01:15:39 These, these princes, biting it by kingly heels.
01:15:42 You know, who made like a, it was like,
01:15:45 it was like a good enough summary of Kingdom Hearts.
01:15:47 And I appreciate, it's like animated.
01:15:48 I'm sure he did a good job.
01:15:49 I have not actually watched it.
01:15:50 Great, but I heard from one,
01:15:53 he says like the beginning of the video,
01:15:54 someone in my stream yesterday told me,
01:15:56 Nate, did you know Barry has only played Kingdom Hearts I
01:16:01 and half of Kingdom Hearts II
01:16:03 and yet this man, Danes,
01:16:05 to make a fucking story summary of every,
01:16:08 talk about reading Wikipedia and making videos out of it.
01:16:11 Wouldn't you fucking finish the,
01:16:13 if you're making a video about the story.
01:16:14 He didn't even finish two a good game.
01:16:17 Okay, well for what is it a good game?
01:16:18 You know what's even worse than that though?
01:16:20 What?
01:16:20 I love this man to death,
01:16:21 but AVGN made a whole 10 minute video about Kingdom Hearts
01:16:25 without having played any of them.
01:16:27 That's, that's.
01:16:29 Or I think he was playing his way through them,
01:16:31 but like he didn't know anything about that.
01:16:32 He literally just made a video that's like,
01:16:34 what's up with all the titles?
01:16:36 Whoa.
01:16:36 And I was like, what are you doing?
01:16:37 You know, that was, that was a video.
01:16:40 I liked that video.
01:16:41 I gave it a pass because it's AVGN.
01:16:43 But I would have preferred like an AVGN video
01:16:47 about any of the Kingdom Hearts games.
01:16:49 Like if he did.
01:16:50 Imagine if AVGN did a real video
01:16:51 reviewing Kingdom Hearts one or something.
01:16:52 Or like all the Crafty Spinoff games.
01:16:54 Yeah.
01:16:55 That would be.
01:16:56 Yeah, yeah.
01:16:57 Making them faces.
01:16:58 Saying, oh this is not.
01:16:59 This is the shit load of fuck right here.
01:17:00 That's what I come to see.
01:17:01 That's what I like.
01:17:03 That's why it feels like a cheap like paycheck cash grab.
01:17:06 Like need a video for this month.
01:17:07 You know.
01:17:08 Kingdom Hearts is hot.
01:17:09 Not going to play the game.
01:17:10 I don't even know.
01:17:11 Just going to read Wikipedia.
01:17:12 I'm not saying this is,
01:17:13 I'm not saying this is any better,
01:17:14 but like I wouldn't be surprised
01:17:16 from the way that he framed it at the start of the video
01:17:18 that like people were just requesting him
01:17:20 to talk about it a lot.
01:17:21 That like everyone wanted him to do Kingdom Hearts
01:17:23 that he didn't know anything about it.
01:17:25 So he just made a video being like,
01:17:26 hey, I don't know anything about it
01:17:28 and it seems confusing.
01:17:29 So, you know, but like the way he presented it though,
01:17:34 it's like, it's simultaneously as that.
01:17:35 But it's like, yeah, but the title and thumbnail implies
01:17:37 that you're actually going to say something
01:17:39 about Kingdom Hearts and you're not.
01:17:40 So it ended up feeling like clickbait.
01:17:43 It felt like some.
01:17:44 I think this meme.
01:17:45 I think that honestly, I swear to God,
01:17:47 I mean, I've been V for like a fucking decade
01:17:49 and longer talking about Kingdom Hearts and shit
01:17:52 and like discussing Lauren whatnot.
01:17:53 And I really think the meme that this story
01:17:57 is too complicated to figure out has deeply set in,
01:18:01 despite the, like there's many infographics
01:18:03 and like meme posts about like,
01:18:05 it's really not that hard guys.
01:18:06 You just have to think a little bit.
01:18:08 It's like, I had like, like going through it
01:18:12 for like, you know, one and two.
01:18:16 Just after the lecture, I was like, yeah, I'll play it.
01:18:18 I think I was already playing at the time.
01:18:20 But like, I wanted to know how complex it was
01:18:24 because I like complex things.
01:18:28 Like the parts of the Caribbean three,
01:18:30 the people say, oh, that's such a convoluted plot.
01:18:32 I love how convoluted it is.
01:18:34 I love trying to follow along.
01:18:35 And so I was like, Kingdom Hearts
01:18:36 is probably going to be something I love.
01:18:38 And it's not even that complex.
01:18:41 It's just like a combination of a few things.
01:18:43 It's edgy and stupid a lot of the time.
01:18:46 It has a few, like a lot of the games in the series
01:18:49 have silly names, like titles that you would,
01:18:52 like very unconventional titles.
01:18:55 And like side games have lore that comes up
01:19:00 in the main series.
01:19:01 That's really the only three things
01:19:03 that make it sort of confusing a little bit.
01:19:06 But beyond that, it's not that much.
01:19:09 You just need to know.
01:19:10 There are convenience in it more than it's complicated.
01:19:12 It's the real thing.
01:19:13 The problem is that there's actual nonsensical lore
01:19:17 that does not make sense and like is hard to recognize
01:19:21 as you play through.
01:19:22 Like what bothers me about this with Kingdom Hearts,
01:19:25 like Jesse just said, it's more that it's inconvenient.
01:19:27 It's more that it's broken up into too many places.
01:19:29 It's too hard to follow all that.
01:19:31 But like, I think that also a lot of this
01:19:33 is just people are fucking stupid.
01:19:35 And like, there's so many people who are just like,
01:19:39 like going by what I heard people say
01:19:42 about Final Fantasy VII online,
01:19:44 I thought it would be literally incomprehensible.
01:19:47 Like the way people talk about that game is like,
01:19:49 it's so confusing and so weird.
01:19:50 It makes you think so hard.
01:19:52 It's got so many crazy mysteries.
01:19:52 These people haven't played the game in 20 years.
01:19:54 Or like Evangelion or something where they're like,
01:19:56 oh, it's like, it's such a head fuck.
01:19:58 And it's just like, it's like,
01:20:01 if you've never had exposure to any complicated story,
01:20:05 then yes, you know.
01:20:06 I hear that shit and it's like,
01:20:07 well, I followed it perfectly fine at nine years old.
01:20:10 You fucking retard.
01:20:11 So, whoa, did you, whoa, this story's got like themes.
01:20:14 And like, it's trying to like say something.
01:20:16 It's like, it's more about like just that sometimes
01:20:19 you have to fill in the gaps of what was going on.
01:20:22 And like, the show gives you the tools to do it
01:20:24 or the game gives you the tools to do it.
01:20:26 And those people just don't know how to use those tools.
01:20:28 You know?
01:20:29 That's exactly right.
01:20:30 And I think that then when you go read a Wikipedia entry,
01:20:32 and it's true, these holes are there
01:20:34 and you haven't actually put in the effort
01:20:36 to play the fucking game that gives you the resources
01:20:39 to make obvious inferences like that, then-
01:20:42 Final Fantasy VII tells you-
01:20:43 Yeah, you're high and dry,
01:20:44 because you didn't play the game or whatever.
01:20:45 Everything in the lore is in the game.
01:20:47 You can find like houses and like documents.
01:20:49 You could read about Genova and like Professor Gast
01:20:52 and where like the Shinra Corporation came from.
01:20:54 They don't want to do that.
01:20:55 They want to read what you read.
01:20:56 But it's all there.
01:20:57 There's like the fucking glossary and stuff
01:21:01 and like character bios that are in Kingdom Hearts III.
01:21:04 After you meet a character,
01:21:05 you can go read about them.
01:21:08 If you have a little trouble, like who was that again?
01:21:10 You can find all the information
01:21:12 in all three of the Kingdom Hearts main games.
01:21:15 I mean, this was-
01:21:16 I go and read that because like most other games
01:21:20 that have things like that, I don't need to read it.
01:21:22 But like in Kingdom Hearts I do.
01:21:23 And that's really the only difference.
01:21:24 Once I have read it, I get it.
01:21:26 You gotta remember we're dealing with a gaming pop culture
01:21:29 where like the last of us is the greatest depth
01:21:32 and cinematic achievement imaginable in media.
01:21:34 Like fucking, you know.
01:21:36 Or God of War with like people are saying like God of War
01:21:39 has the best story in a video game.
01:21:41 Every fucking day of my life for the last year,
01:21:46 every fucking day I wake up and I see,
01:21:50 this video was good until you called Joel boring.
01:21:54 How dare you be smirks the name of Joel.
01:21:57 Why are people so defensive about the last of us?
01:22:00 I don't understand.
01:22:02 It's like just a-
01:22:04 It's a mediocre fucking story.
01:22:06 It's not, it's fine.
01:22:08 I didn't even say it was bad.
01:22:10 It's just fine.
01:22:11 Why do people care so much about that fucking game?
01:22:17 They need their golden idol to show people as like,
01:22:21 this is why you need to take my dumb ass opinion seriously
01:22:25 on video games matter.
01:22:27 I didn't waste my time playing these hundreds and hundreds
01:22:30 of hours of meaningless games that do nothing but fill a void
01:22:33 that is the lack of accomplishment in my life
01:22:35 that I make up for by playing these vicarious hero characters.
01:22:38 No, no, no.
01:22:39 This is important in like making me a good person.
01:22:41 I like am Joel and shit.
01:22:43 And I like did save the princess or whatever.
01:22:45 That's not you guys.
01:22:46 Oh God, stop Nate.
01:22:48 You're gonna make me fucking,
01:22:49 you're gonna make me fucking cry, all right?
01:22:50 You should.
01:22:51 Someone needs to call a witch doctor
01:22:53 because I'm seeing several new colors right now.
01:22:56 I wanna make a statement that seems obvious
01:22:59 because it is and everyone's already said it before.
01:23:01 But I have not spiritually resonated with this
01:23:04 until just now.
01:23:05 I Google search Kingdom Hearts 3 full game movie
01:23:09 and I'm watching it.
01:23:10 And the first thing is this bizarre wizard man
01:23:13 telling Anna Mayman that he needs to go on an adventure
01:23:17 for whatever reason.
01:23:17 Is it Merlin?
01:23:18 Maybe, I have no idea.
01:23:20 Anyway, I'm like, okay, yeah, Kingdom Hearts,
01:23:22 gotcha, understand, goofy Donald there, okay, I understand.
01:23:25 Then they go to Hercules or land
01:23:28 and I can like easily in my mind think,
01:23:30 okay, Final Fantasy, Disney, Donald, Goofy
01:23:32 and stuff like that.
01:23:33 But for some reason, now they're in a Disney renaissance movie
01:23:39 and then they approach Hades.
01:23:41 And I hear James Woods.
01:23:43 I think Munchie might be a little behind
01:23:46 on his Kingdom Hearts.
01:23:48 I hear James Woods giving the same fucking voice
01:23:52 he's been giving for 20 years now.
01:23:54 Old and disheveled, like fucking choking up
01:23:56 in the middle of recording,
01:23:57 doesn't he wanna do another take
01:23:58 and then he's gonna die too soon
01:23:59 and then actually be able to get the same amount of shots.
01:24:01 He loves Joe Ladies.
01:24:02 And I just hear him say, huh, fucking Hercules,
01:24:05 more like Jercules, huh, get it?
01:24:07 And I'm like, are you fucking joking me?
01:24:10 Like Kingdom Hearts and Disney are the same game?
01:24:13 What?
01:24:15 They're fucking, that's so weird, dude.
01:24:18 I can't believe that fucking Final Fantasy Disney
01:24:21 are in the same game.
01:24:22 Like I didn't believe it.
01:24:23 Like I knew, okay, Donald Goofy got it.
01:24:26 Like I didn't actually believe that Disney movies
01:24:29 and Q's of Final Fantasy were actually together.
01:24:32 I didn't believe that it couldn't be true.
01:24:34 Okay, the weird thing about that observation, Munchie,
01:24:38 is that I also had that same revelation
01:24:43 as I was playing Kingdom Hearts 3
01:24:45 because I've just been studying lore.
01:24:47 I've been hitting the books about Heartless
01:24:49 and No Ways in the Dark and Keyblades and I'm like,
01:24:51 man, that's where I've been for 13 years.
01:24:54 I finally play Kingdom Hearts 3 and I'm like,
01:24:56 whoa, it's fucking Mike Wazowski, Motherfucker!
01:25:01 Jesus Christ!
01:25:02 You think about all this lore stuff,
01:25:04 but the actual like moment to moment experience
01:25:06 of playing Kingdom Hearts is like 90% only.
01:25:09 Yeah, it is 90% Disney shit.
01:25:11 I fucking like Kingdom Hearts, I was sick.
01:25:15 Oh my God, it's Hercules!
01:25:16 It looks like Hercules!
01:25:18 Oh my God!
01:25:20 Hercules!
01:25:21 The funny thing about talking about the plot
01:25:23 of Kingdom Hearts at all is that it's not the forefront
01:25:27 of why people care about Kingdom Hearts.
01:25:30 Like, I don't think that many people play it for the show.
01:25:33 It's not what the games are about.
01:25:34 The first game is just about a kid
01:25:36 trying to get back to his little girlfriend
01:25:38 and that's really relatable.
01:25:40 Like, it's not really, that's why everyone loves the series
01:25:43 in spite of the fact that everyone hates the lore
01:25:45 because it's not about the lore at all.
01:25:46 The games are about Rapunzel's fucking sexy feet
01:25:49 and you want to come on those feats,
01:25:51 you want her to jack you off those feet
01:25:53 and so you go to the Rapunzel world
01:25:55 and you get what you came for.
01:25:56 Like, they're also about sweet boss battles.
01:26:01 I have a disease, an exotic disease,
01:26:03 there's no way to cure it.
01:26:04 I'm on my deathbed.
01:26:05 Make a wish foundation comes to me
01:26:07 and they say, what do you want?
01:26:08 We'll give you anything.
01:26:09 And I just say to him, make all the Final Fantasy III cutscenes
01:26:14 real and they're happening to me.
01:26:16 I want Hercules to talk to me.
01:26:18 I want Hades to talk to me.
01:26:19 I'm sorry, I'm getting reactivated pissed off
01:26:23 about all the Kingdom Hearts lectures
01:26:24 that are out there now
01:26:25 because I'm really thinking about how the joke
01:26:28 with Nate's video was that nobody cares.
01:26:32 Like, that's the point of-
01:26:33 I did repeat that many times.
01:26:35 Like, the main point of all of the lectures
01:26:36 for the most part is usually that it's-
01:26:38 The climactic moment at the end was like,
01:26:42 they're like, Nate, are these games worth playing?
01:26:43 And I say triumphantly, okay, well, first of all,
01:26:47 if you're playing for the story, stop.
01:26:50 That was the thesis statement of the whole lecture.
01:26:53 That's the thing.
01:26:53 So if that's the case,
01:26:56 like when all these people are making these videos
01:26:58 that are like, whoa, explaining the crazy story of Kingdom,
01:27:01 nobody cared in the first place.
01:27:03 Like, why do we-
01:27:04 We don't need an explanation leading into the new game
01:27:07 because we're not playing it for the story.
01:27:09 We don't need to know what happened.
01:27:10 Just put it on, look at the flashy lights
01:27:13 and fight, you know, Disney villains.
01:27:15 Like, that's the point.
01:27:16 My favorite thing to do in Kingdom Hearts 3
01:27:19 is to run up walls.
01:27:20 There's so many walls you can just run up.
01:27:22 You just walk up to the wall and you press forward
01:27:25 and you just start running.
01:27:26 And then you can do, you can press square
01:27:28 and you can kick off the wall
01:27:29 and then you can jump and you can double jump
01:27:30 and then you can do an air dash.
01:27:32 You can just be really high up
01:27:34 and then you fall down and you smash things.
01:27:35 I think because I haven't like seen-
01:27:37 You can explain the story of Kingdom Hearts.
01:27:40 You can explain the story of Kingdom Hearts in one sentence.
01:27:42 It's a fun anime game with Disney shit.
01:27:45 Woo!
01:27:46 That should be all the videos.
01:27:47 I think because Mickey Mouse and Donald Look
01:27:49 are just like icons, right?
01:27:50 Like, I haven't like seen any shorts of them.
01:27:52 I don't know anything about them as characters, really.
01:27:54 But when I see Hercules,
01:27:56 a film that I've seen many times before
01:27:59 and like I have like an emotional connection
01:28:00 to Hercules, the Disney movie.
01:28:03 And I see him looking at bad evil hoodie.
01:28:06 Heaven, let your lights shine down.
01:28:08 Whoa!
01:28:10 I see him looking at him menacingly.
01:28:12 I just am fucking, like I'm seeing too many colors right now.
01:28:16 I understand what it's like to be fucking colorblind
01:28:19 and I'm saying I'm seeing way too many colors.
01:28:21 The best part of the game by far.
01:28:23 To clarify what I was trying to say before
01:28:25 is that like why I was upset thinking back on it
01:28:28 is the fact that these people making these videos
01:28:31 don't get that.
01:28:33 Like they don't get that that's the, like your lecture-
01:28:36 That's the appeal.
01:28:37 Your lecture was making fun of the story.
01:28:39 You're like, hey, I am explaining this whole story
01:28:42 because I happen to be such a huge fan of Kingdom Hearts 2.
01:28:45 Incidentally, I'm telling you-
01:28:46 Okay, I gotta be that guy.
01:28:47 I gotta be that guy.
01:28:48 So it's like, is that like an in-joke then?
01:28:50 Like why does the story have to be so convoluted?
01:28:53 Okay, even in the games,
01:28:55 Nomura clearly takes this very seriously.
01:28:58 I was gonna say like, yeah, you can say that
01:29:00 you don't play for the story, but like someone cares.
01:29:02 Look, I just wanna say-
01:29:03 I just wanna say, look, the butt of the joke I feel
01:29:06 in the Kingdom Hearts lecture is that look,
01:29:07 I am the joke because I care when I should not.
01:29:10 That's what I'm trying to say.
01:29:12 Is that like the whole point is that like
01:29:16 these games are looked down on for having
01:29:19 like a dumb premise and a dumb story.
01:29:22 And you're like, yeah, they do, but I played them anyways
01:29:26 and I obsessed over them and I learned it all
01:29:28 because that's the way I am.
01:29:29 Anything I consume, I learn everything about it
01:29:32 because that's you, that's your personality.
01:29:34 And so like for you to make this lecture,
01:29:36 yeah, you are the butt of the joke.
01:29:37 Like, hey, I'm a 27-year-old man
01:29:39 talking about Kingdom Hearts,
01:29:41 but like the whole time you're presenting it as,
01:29:44 this is, I'm explaining this because it's funny
01:29:46 and stupid and doesn't matter and you don't need to know it.
01:29:48 I'm like, that's kind of the point of the lectures
01:29:50 is that for the most part again,
01:29:52 we talk about things that like we have
01:29:54 this insane knowledge of that no one else cares about.
01:29:57 Like that's kind of the joke.
01:29:58 That's the premise of the lectures to begin with, right?
01:30:00 That's what I'm saying.
01:30:01 That they are a joke.
01:30:02 So like, so then you get to these other people
01:30:05 who are making videos about this
01:30:07 and it's like they haven't even played the games
01:30:09 and they're like trying to sincerely explain the story
01:30:13 as if like that really matters.
01:30:15 And it's like, no, the whole point was
01:30:17 that it doesn't really matter, you know?
01:30:19 I haven't seen any of these like other explanation videos,
01:30:23 but I can pretty much imagine what they are.
01:30:25 And like they probably come at it from the angle
01:30:28 that they're doing some kind of weird
01:30:30 like consumer advocacy thing.
01:30:32 Like they are providing you a service.
01:30:34 Like now you don't, like now you know.
01:30:36 Like now you're up to, I'm getting you up to speed.
01:30:39 Like you need to know this information.
01:30:40 This is why you should watch my video.
01:30:42 So you will know the things that you must know
01:30:44 before you get into Kingdom Hearts 3.
01:30:46 Yeah, yeah.
01:30:48 Here's my advice for if you want to play Kingdom Hearts 3.
01:30:50 It's if you do, if you care about the story,
01:30:55 then if you plan to watch all the cut scenes,
01:30:57 just go play the other games first.
01:31:00 If you don't, then just skip the cut scenes.
01:31:03 Like there's no reason to watch a YouTube video
01:31:06 explaining it all and then play the new game
01:31:08 and expect to like the story.
01:31:09 It's like, if you were going to like the story,
01:31:12 you would go play the other ones.
01:31:13 Why jump in now?
01:31:15 Why come in late like this?
01:31:16 But they want to be on the new thing, did you?
01:31:18 They want to be talking about it.
01:31:19 I don't even think it's working
01:31:20 because it doesn't seem like many people actually care
01:31:22 about Kingdom Hearts 3 now that it's happening.
01:31:23 They want to be able to say, oh, Kingdom Hearts,
01:31:26 Kingdom Hearts was my childhood.
01:31:29 Yeah, that's cool.
01:31:30 Because they don't even say that half of them are like,
01:31:31 I haven't even played the goddamn games.
01:31:33 I haven't played one and a half.
01:31:35 They want to be able to talk like that anyway.
01:31:37 I happily wear the hat of Elitist on this subject.
01:31:41 If nothing else, I happily adopted.
01:31:43 And yes, on just that level,
01:31:46 I feel comfortable shit talking people
01:31:48 who are going to try to talk about these games
01:31:50 without doing as much effort as I put into play them.
01:31:54 Whether or not, you know, I just did it for fun,
01:31:56 but it became my full-time job later in life.
01:31:59 And so, you know, I'm the expert.
01:32:02 Who the fuck is Barry Kramer?
01:32:03 Who hasn't even, honestly,
01:32:05 that makes me more angry than AVGN.
01:32:07 Like that he gave up on Kingdom Hearts 2.
01:32:09 Like, God, like if you're making this video,
01:32:11 go back and finish the game.
01:32:12 Yes.
01:32:13 Or you should feel bad.
01:32:15 It's got to be relevant to the SEO optimization, bro.
01:32:18 And you know what?
01:32:19 This ties back to that thing
01:32:20 at the very beginning of our talk today.
01:32:22 It's like, when you are a YouTuber,
01:32:24 the pressure is now on you.
01:32:26 Produce content.
01:32:28 Don't worry about research.
01:32:29 Okay, well, let's not blame.
01:32:30 I know that's the nature of the game.
01:32:31 But still.
01:32:32 I don't think you can blame that on Barry.
01:32:33 Because Barry puts out a video once.
01:32:33 No, no.
01:32:34 Yes, you fucking can.
01:32:35 If Barry wanted to make a Kingdom Hearts video
01:32:37 and SEO optimized,
01:32:39 then he should have gone back before the game.
01:32:41 But he knew the game was coming out.
01:32:43 He had fucking time.
01:32:44 It's not like it snuck up on him.
01:32:45 No, no, that's all fair.
01:32:47 I know he tried to get it out in time for the game,
01:32:49 but that was not for SEO purposes.
01:32:51 He did that because it's sexy
01:32:53 to get something out about a game
01:32:54 right before it comes out.
01:32:55 Like, everybody wants to have that experience.
01:32:58 But like, don't do it
01:32:59 if it's not something you actually care about.
01:33:01 Like, I have every season,
01:33:03 like season three of Attack on Titan or something
01:33:06 will come out.
01:33:07 And I'm like, I'm not going to write a video about that
01:33:09 because I'm not going to watch Attack on Titan
01:33:11 seasons one and two
01:33:12 so that I can have an opinion on this, you know?
01:33:14 But Barry's like, I'm not going to play those games.
01:33:16 He wasn't even successful financially.
01:33:19 It was a failed movie.
01:33:20 It wasn't even like the most popular thing.
01:33:22 So why is anime man talking to him?
01:33:25 Why was he talking about the main game?
01:33:27 Hercules world is in every single Kingdom Hearts.
01:33:29 It's relevant to the Kingdom Hearts main game.
01:33:31 What?
01:33:32 He's a recurring character.
01:33:33 You go to it each time.
01:33:34 I mean, the first two games,
01:33:35 the first two games you go to like-
01:33:36 Monty, didn't you watch Barry Cramer's seminal video
01:33:38 explaining the story?
01:33:40 Oh, and by the way-
01:33:41 They're talking like they're friends.
01:33:43 Hercules and anime man are talking as if they are friends.
01:33:47 Like, they know each other like they're like,
01:33:48 oh hey dude, what the fuck, welcome to ancient Greece.
01:33:51 The-
01:33:52 No.
01:33:53 The Hercules world.
01:33:54 This is impossible.
01:33:55 In Kingdom Hearts one and Kingdom Hearts two
01:33:56 was host to the dope Colosseum thing
01:33:59 where you fight like series of battles
01:34:01 and unlock epic dope shit at the towards the end of the game
01:34:04 and you can go through and it gets, it's awesome stuff.
01:34:06 You can refight battles with bosses over and over there.
01:34:09 Not in Kingdom Hearts three.
01:34:10 Just not there, just not there.
01:34:13 That's just a small point.
01:34:15 Well, whatever.
01:34:16 I just wanna say, I don't besmirch Barry Cramer
01:34:18 for making a video relevant to a thing.
01:34:22 I, you know, whatever, I respect the hustle.
01:34:25 People, you know, you wanna grow your channel,
01:34:28 you gotta do stuff like that.
01:34:29 I just don't think that that video will ever be looked on
01:34:32 as anything like particularly good by anyone.
01:34:35 And it was-
01:34:35 There was nothing-
01:34:36 That he has spent his time on it.
01:34:38 There was nothing stopping him
01:34:39 from just finishing the fucking game.
01:34:41 He just didn't want to.
01:34:42 Even if he did finish the game,
01:34:44 the video would have been like from a perspective
01:34:46 of a person who just sort of kind of-
01:34:47 Well, in fairness, let's be fair.
01:34:49 I haven't played any Kingdom Hearts games
01:34:51 since the second one like 15 years ago
01:34:53 and I made my video about it in less than a day.
01:34:57 Yeah.
01:34:59 That sounds about right.
01:34:59 Your video has like, like the point of it
01:35:03 is obviously different from the point of those videos.
01:35:07 Like, again, like what I was praising Nate's video for
01:35:10 is the fact that he's taking the piss out of it
01:35:11 and admitting this doesn't matter.
01:35:13 Well, I just mean, let's not,
01:35:15 let's not pull out the torches and pitchforks
01:35:18 for Barry Cramer for not finishing the second game
01:35:21 when-
01:35:21 No, yeah, but your video isn't,
01:35:24 I'm explaining the plot of Kingdom Hearts.
01:35:27 That's what makes it annoying is that it's like
01:35:30 you didn't experience the plot of Kingdom Hearts.
01:35:32 How can you talk about it with any kind of like,
01:35:36 how can you capture the essence of it in any way?
01:35:38 You know-
01:35:39 So we're just inter-thieves.
01:35:41 You want to buy a sundial?
01:35:44 That is true.
01:35:45 Remember that guy?
01:35:45 Remember?
01:35:46 Hey, you want to buy a sundial?
01:35:49 Remember that guy?
01:35:50 Well, I am an elitist.
01:35:51 I don't want to actually act like no one's allowed
01:35:54 to make a video unless they have like more information
01:35:56 or like experience than me.
01:35:57 Okay, that's fair.
01:35:58 I suppose what it really is is a more of like,
01:36:01 it's more of like, why will I care about your video?
01:36:04 Like, you know, will it last the test of time?
01:36:06 It's all like quality concerns
01:36:08 as opposed to like permission to make a video.
01:36:10 It's where none of us have watched this video either.
01:36:13 So we're all just like,
01:36:14 just getting angry at the mere thought and idea.
01:36:16 But just the fact that I know
01:36:17 he didn't beat Kingdom Hearts fucking too.
01:36:20 Right.
01:36:21 Why would you-
01:36:21 Insulting.
01:36:22 It hurts my soul, but that's okay.
01:36:24 I'm going to beat his heart into the ground.
01:36:27 Even the lowly hypocrite beat Kingdom Hearts too.
01:36:31 Yeah, the furtive hypocrite.
01:36:32 You know what's funny is,
01:36:33 it's so easily overlooked.
01:36:34 I'm realizing I did a video just like Nate's Kingdom,
01:36:37 not Nate's, Jesse's Kingdom Hearts video
01:36:40 about Fate's Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works
01:36:42 back when that came out.
01:36:43 Where it was basically just like,
01:36:44 hey, fate's coming out.
01:36:46 Here's all the things I do know about fate,
01:36:48 which is not very much, but I'm excited, you know?
01:36:52 Like, why not?
01:36:54 And how did that go?
01:36:55 Went really well.
01:36:56 Well, all right, there you go, I guess.
01:36:58 Very did nothing wrong.
01:36:59 Well, there's a price for unjudgment.
01:37:02 I mean, it's worth noting that my completely terrible
01:37:07 and utterly worthless rambling Kingdom Hearts video
01:37:10 already has surpassed in views the epic and amazing
01:37:16 stupid characterable video
01:37:17 that I've wanted to make forever.
01:37:19 No!
01:37:19 And put a lot of my heart and soul into it.
01:37:21 Yeah, that says a lot.
01:37:23 We all know, we know how this works.
01:37:25 I put out the world over album
01:37:28 at the last day of last year.
01:37:30 I think it has less than 10,000 views still.
01:37:33 I spent all year working on it, you know?
01:37:35 In the background, all year.
01:37:37 The next day, I put out a vlog
01:37:39 called Like It's Okay to Hate Anime
01:37:42 that I just had the idea for on the spur of the moment,
01:37:44 recorded in like five minutes,
01:37:45 didn't even really agree with it, watching it back,
01:37:47 and posted it anyway, and it's got like 50,000 views.
01:37:49 Like, we know how it works.
01:37:50 We'll never surprise me, but it will always make me sad.
01:37:53 It will always disappoint.
01:37:54 As content boys on YouTube and otherwise,
01:37:56 I mean, the purpose of what I'm doing
01:37:59 with like my Weagawa approach is like,
01:38:01 I'm making my ones for them,
01:38:03 so I just have the freedom to make the ones for me.
01:38:06 And, you know, that's gonna be my way forward.
01:38:11 Which is the name of a Keyblade, but anyway.
01:38:14 I remember Oath Taker.
01:38:17 That's actually the Oath Keeper.
01:38:18 Isn't it Oath Keeper?
01:38:18 Oath Keeper, there you go.
01:38:19 That's a base fest.
01:38:20 Which George R.R. Martin would famously rip off.
01:38:23 Oh yeah.
01:38:24 Am I thinking of the Weight of the Dawn?
01:38:25 Okay, whatever.
01:38:26 No, there's definitely an Oath Keeper.
01:38:27 No, no, I meant Weight Forward.
01:38:28 Oh, Weight Forward is the game that made Shantae.
01:38:30 Okay, yeah, never mind.
01:38:31 I was thinking of the Weight of the Dawn.
01:38:32 But Oath Keeper is also,
01:38:33 when the Stark sword is melted down,
01:38:36 it's forged into two swords,
01:38:37 and Bran gets one of them.
01:38:39 Right, Tyrion Lannister naming it
01:38:41 after his favorite video game, Kingdom Hearts One,
01:38:43 where Sora gets that Keyblade from Kyrie.
01:38:46 Tyrion has really patrician taste in anime.
01:38:50 When are they gonna make a cross between DreamWorks
01:38:52 and what's the other one?
01:38:54 Get out, Miss Swamp!
01:38:55 There it is.
01:38:56 Yeah, I wanna play PS4 Shrek meets anime.
01:39:01 Oh, so you mean you want like Dragon Quest
01:39:05 meets DreamWorks, right?
01:39:06 Dragon Quest meets DreamWorks.
01:39:09 Now we're talking.
01:39:09 I wanna go to Eldorado.
01:39:11 I wanna do all the cool shit.
01:39:13 I wanna be the Prince of Egypt.
01:39:15 We can go to Eldorado and see that
01:39:16 unusually fit Mayan girl.
01:39:18 The studio that made like Coraline and Kubo,
01:39:20 you could do them with, yeah,
01:39:23 Leica with Atlas then, for the persona.
01:39:26 What about that one, Rango, Dango,
01:39:28 with Johnny Depp as that lizard?
01:39:30 Jango.
01:39:30 Rango.
01:39:31 Rango.
01:39:32 That was a Jango.
01:39:33 Not Jango.
01:39:34 Oh, I wanna go to the Jango world in Kingdom Hearts,
01:39:36 and you know.
01:39:37 Yeah, you know, Quentin Tarantino plus Steven Universe.
01:39:40 You know that?
01:39:42 I wanna be Sora in there, in that saloon
01:39:47 in the snowstorm with the hateful ape,
01:39:49 with Samuel L. Jackson telling me about
01:39:52 how he whipped out his big black cock
01:39:54 and fuckin' mouth break to dude
01:39:56 cause he was a slaver's son or something.
01:39:58 You know.
01:39:59 Call him.
01:40:00 We got him.
01:40:01 We got him.
01:40:02 We got him.
01:40:03 We need the series.
01:40:03 Yes, it does happen.
01:40:04 Yes, it does happen.
01:40:05 There's a long monologue about making this white dude
01:40:06 suck his big black cock and it was pretty sick.
01:40:09 We need the Kingdom Hearts to grow with its audience.
01:40:12 Hmm.
01:40:14 He said pretend it's not.
01:40:15 Disney absorbs the Tarantino library,
01:40:18 and then now they can do that.
01:40:19 I mean, they got Star Wars?
01:40:20 They got, there was something else.
01:40:22 When's Iron Man gonna show up in Kingdom Hearts 3?
01:40:25 I assume any one of these days.
01:40:28 I assume fuckin' that they didn't make a Star Wars world
01:40:31 in Kingdom Hearts,
01:40:32 but I really would've liked to see that.
01:40:34 I don't know why they did that.
01:40:35 I mean, okay.
01:40:35 Because the game's been in development
01:40:37 before they got the rights to
01:40:40 it.
01:40:41 Probably.
01:40:41 So it can't have it in there.
01:40:42 Well, the end of this saga,
01:40:44 maybe with the next saga they'll be like,
01:40:45 okay it's kind of a fresh start time,
01:40:47 let's get fuckin' Marvel and Star Wars involved.
01:40:49 Oh, shit.
01:40:49 So it's not the end?
01:40:50 No, it's not the end.
01:40:51 No, it is not.
01:40:52 Oh, cool.
01:40:53 Why?
01:40:54 I can't wait.
01:40:54 I'm looking forward to it.
01:40:55 You're the only one I have ever experienced 3 so far
01:40:58 because me and Digi only played it
01:41:00 for a couple hours on the Ryan game stream so far,
01:41:04 is I sat down,
01:41:05 I booted up the game for the first time.
01:41:07 It was like, oh man.
01:41:08 Kingdom Hearts 3. This game is real. This is pretty crazy. I can't believe after all
01:41:14 this time it actually physically exists and is in my possession. And I'm just, you know,
01:41:19 going along, going through the opening, listening to the babble that passes for cutscenes in
01:41:24 Kingdom Hearts. I'm like, yeah, yeah, I've played a few of these. I've been here before.
01:41:28 And then it fades out and all of a sudden a title comes in. Kingdom Hearts 2.9. I'm
01:41:34 like, oh, my fucking god. No, the box, the box lied to me. What is happening? How is
01:41:43 this possible? I made a joke about this on Twitter a year ago and now it happened. It
01:41:49 was a joke. The meaning, yeah, I get it. Okay. The only meaning of that is that that cutscene
01:41:56 and that the beginning of the game is like of what Sora and Kairi and Riku and whatever
01:42:00 we're doing. That was actually part of the Kingdom Hearts 2.8 package. It was the secret
01:42:06 ending that you unlock where it shows, it literally shows up everything right up to,
01:42:11 like it overlaps with the beginning of Kingdom Hearts 3 as Sora heads off to Olympus Colosseum.
01:42:16 All of that was Kingdom Hearts 2.9 in Kingdom Hearts 3.
01:42:19 Do you guys have stupid that sentence?
01:42:21 If you do.
01:42:22 So Kingdom Hearts 2. So Kingdom Hearts 3. Kingdom Hearts 3 is actually Kingdom Hearts
01:42:26 3 though, right?
01:42:27 Yeah.
01:42:28 Later, the Kingdom Hearts 3 logo comes in today.
01:42:31 I'll add to Tom's impressions after the first four hours. Game seems not fun at all from
01:42:38 watching Tom has had no fun so far, pretty much.
01:42:42 No.
01:42:43 Are you still Olympus?
01:42:44 He's still Olympus.
01:42:45 We just finished Twilight Town.
01:42:46 Well, it's Square, so you know the fun starts at around 38 hours in.
01:42:48 Yeah, yeah.
01:42:49 Yeah, that's correct.
01:42:50 The thing I hate the most is that in regards to the running up walls like Hippo was saying,
01:42:57 I hate how everything that you can action with has like that white line going up it.
01:43:02 It looks so bad.
01:43:03 They turned the entire world shiny because you can run on everything and it looks like
01:43:08 shit.
01:43:09 I hate it.
01:43:10 I hate it.
01:43:11 I know they did it.
01:43:12 It also makes it...
01:43:13 You fucking negative man.
01:43:14 It makes you feel even worse about the stuff you can't climb up because like in Traverse
01:43:16 Town you can climb up like the buildings but then there's a wall around the town that
01:43:20 you can't climb and so you're just like, oh, okay.
01:43:23 So I understand why they did it so you could distinguish what you can and can't climb.
01:43:26 But you can climb most things and it's just like there's other aesthetics they could have
01:43:32 used that would have done the same thing, not so annoying.
01:43:35 But I do think the reason for that and the game is known for being very easy and also
01:43:41 for the stupid long pauses in the cutscenes is probably just because it's a baby game.
01:43:46 Like the long pauses are kids can watch it and take it all in, I think.
01:43:51 I'm sure that...
01:43:52 I mean, I absolutely feel this is a game made for the masses, absolutely.
01:43:56 It is not made for like hardcore, Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, speedrun level one players,
01:44:00 although there is a level one option that you can choose, at least on pride mode that
01:44:04 I'm playing on.
01:44:05 So maybe I should have fucking done that and then the game would actually be hard.
01:44:08 I think that's in every mode or at least I can see it in mine.
01:44:10 I was just playing normal mode.
01:44:12 By the way, Gib, the other reason that I have such strong negative emotions about the flow
01:44:15 motion stuff is because the flow motion stuff is very much like it was in Dream Drop Distance.
01:44:21 The whole structure...
01:44:22 I'm going to talk about this in my wee Agua, but the whole structure of the game is such
01:44:25 a way to give you cool flow motion stuff that has completely removed any like platforming
01:44:31 challenges.
01:44:32 They are gone from the game.
01:44:33 Nate, platforming was always the worst thing about the game.
01:44:37 Correct.
01:44:38 Correct.
01:44:39 I always liked it.
01:44:40 Absolutely.
01:44:41 I missed it.
01:44:42 You guys are wrong and I won't admit it.
01:44:45 Specifically Kingdom Hearts One was like dreadful.
01:44:48 Kingdom Hearts Two was okay.
01:44:50 It just wasn't very interesting.
01:44:51 It was just like, I can see a thing up there.
01:44:53 How do I jump?
01:44:54 I guess I need to come back when I have another thing.
01:44:56 Well, fine.
01:44:57 Okay.
01:44:58 Platforming was kind of frustrating in Kingdom Hearts One, just the way to do it.
01:45:00 Even if you guys talk about it, can't you fly in those games?
01:45:03 But that's the thing, Jesse.
01:45:04 You eventually in Kingdom Hearts One, you eventually unlock movement abilities one by
01:45:10 one and it's satisfying and gives you access to new areas and it feels great.
01:45:15 That was completely removed.
01:45:16 Yeah, but like certain things that you have to do before you get those powers are like
01:45:21 platforming segments, which are terrible.
01:45:24 People always bring up Wonderland, it was really frustrating the first time you do it, which
01:45:27 is true.
01:45:28 Yeah, and Tarzan and like all of them.
01:45:30 All of them are bad until you get flying and then it's sort of okay.
01:45:33 But I like when a game starts shit and then turns good.
01:45:36 I like it.
01:45:37 Yeah, I think I'm with you.
01:45:38 I like when games are good and get better.
01:45:40 We got to stop talking about Kingdom Hearts.
01:45:42 When you get gliding, it feels great.
01:45:45 Yeah, you go God mode.
01:45:46 Gliding in Kingdom Hearts feels so good.
01:45:48 Dare we give up that euphoria of finally getting good movement mechanics, even though we have
01:45:53 to suffer through 40 hours of shit movement mechanics.
01:45:56 I say no.
01:45:57 I mean, at this point we've waited 15 years for them, so they might as well put them
01:46:00 at the beginning of the game.
01:46:01 I'm very happy they put Dodger back in the same thing and not something you have to unlock.
01:46:07 Tease me just a little more, please.
01:46:10 No, please.
01:46:11 Daddy, no more.
01:46:12 No more Kingdom Hearts.
01:46:13 We've been talking about this for 15.
01:46:15 Yeah.
01:46:16 Yeah, I guess.
01:46:17 Zen, huckstable.
01:46:18 Hey, what's up?
01:46:19 Oh, yeah.
01:46:20 Just to close it out, I'm definitely hooked on Kingdom Hearts and I'm going to play every
01:46:24 single game now.
01:46:25 Good.
01:46:26 Amazing.
01:46:27 Kingdom Hearts 1.
01:46:28 Great game.
01:46:29 They're not super long as far as RPGs go.
01:46:30 Zen, have you thought of anything to talk about in this long 45 minutes that we've been
01:46:32 talking about Kingdom Hearts?
01:46:34 I haven't thought of a thing.
01:46:36 Nate came to me yesterday and he was like, oh, you think of a topic or two or three and
01:46:41 I was like, I can think of zero and here we are.
01:46:44 Fair enough.
01:46:45 Yes, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast.
01:46:47 No, we're all the same.
01:46:49 We're all fucking calm, empty handed.
01:46:52 Hey, I brought something.
01:46:53 I brought something.
01:46:54 How the hell do you do it?
01:46:55 Well.
01:46:56 It's for your fucking self, bitch.
01:46:57 Yeah.
01:46:58 Well, okay.
01:46:59 We're actually clearly divided along lines of those who put an effort and those who
01:47:02 don't.
01:47:03 And you know, it's pretty clear who's who.
01:47:05 No, I didn't put an effort, but it's-
01:47:06 The problem is-
01:47:07 No, I fucking brought a topic.
01:47:08 Oh, did you?
01:47:09 I brought a thing to talk about.
01:47:10 Don't you remember?
01:47:11 It was less than an hour ago.
01:47:12 Oh, I forgot, that was good.
01:47:13 The thing that I always make the exact same mistake every single time I write that note
01:47:17 for the PCP, where I make notes that are like, I want to like pace myself and like explain
01:47:22 like a thought that I'm having, which is not at all like the way to make notes for the
01:47:27 PCP.
01:47:28 No, this is not a conductive environment to explaining things.
01:47:31 Exactly.
01:47:32 Exactly, Jesse.
01:47:33 Like, it's not about like making thoughts happen and explaining yourself.
01:47:37 It's just about screaming and about fucking playing video games with Hercules from Disney's
01:47:43 Hercules on them.
01:47:44 That's all this is about.
01:47:45 Here's my pre-show process for the PCP is that it's usually like 1258 and I see an
01:47:53 at everyone notification and I go, oh my God, it's Sunday already?
01:47:58 And then-
01:47:59 I need to praise the Lord right now.
01:48:01 Yeah.
01:48:02 I go, fuck, I'll be on.
01:48:04 And then while I'm setting up my mic, I think, is there anything I could possibly talk about?
01:48:08 And usually I just based on whatever I've been doing and like what I could, like, you
01:48:12 know, the whole YouTube thing, like that's all I've been fucking doing is-
01:48:15 Well, I'm reading Hentai right now.
01:48:17 So like, you want to talk about that?
01:48:19 I'm down.
01:48:20 Right now?
01:48:21 Hell yeah.
01:48:22 Yeah, right now.
01:48:23 Yeah, what do you got?
01:48:24 Back it up and push it.
01:48:25 Well, if you follow Zenhuxtable on Twitter and you use mobile where it shows you people's
01:48:29 liked tweets, expect to be flooded with porn.
01:48:32 I mean, you hear that, huh?
01:48:34 He's not the king.
01:48:35 There's more.
01:48:36 There's more prolific porn likers out there.
01:48:40 Yeah.
01:48:41 But he is guilty.
01:48:42 But he is guilty.
01:48:43 It's a tough one to find.
01:48:44 Hippo's a huge porn liker.
01:48:45 Tough to find someone who likes it more.
01:48:46 Yeah.
01:48:47 Biggest porn liker I know, maybe.
01:48:48 Hippo's fucking horny.
01:48:49 Horny on man.
01:48:50 He's just very clandestine about it.
01:48:52 I've never seen him.
01:48:53 When did it become okay to like porn?
01:48:55 That's what I want to fucking know.
01:48:57 When did it become okay to just openly say, like, yeah, I have sex.
01:49:01 Yeah, especially on Sunday.
01:49:02 Let's go back.
01:49:03 I know no one will agree with me.
01:49:05 I know that everyone thinks that sex is cool now for whatever fucking reason you've got
01:49:09 in your head.
01:49:10 But I just want everyone to go back to the time where everyone was fucking ashamed of themselves.
01:49:14 I miss it so fucking much every day of my life.
01:49:17 I sort of agree.
01:49:18 Look, I don't know.
01:49:19 I'm one of these guys who's open about liking hentai and porn and stuff, and I think that's
01:49:23 generally good.
01:49:24 But I don't want to hear a damn word about your actual sex life.
01:49:28 I don't want to hear anything about that.
01:49:30 I find that mega weird, Nate.
01:49:32 Honestly.
01:49:33 I find that mega weird.
01:49:34 I don't know why.
01:49:35 It's so different for me.
01:49:36 I've compartmentalized them completely, and they feel like totally different.
01:49:39 No.
01:49:40 I understand what you're saying, because, like, you know, like, that side of me is a filthy
01:49:44 fucking animal.
01:49:45 I don't want anyone else to see that, and fucking, I don't want to see anyone else's filthy animal.
01:49:49 I know you've got one inside you.
01:49:51 I don't want to see it.
01:49:52 It all depends on how you think about sex and the sex that you have.
01:49:59 Because, like, I mean, to me, that's like saying, like, oh, I don't want to think about it.
01:50:03 I don't want to talk about it.
01:50:04 It's too powerful.
01:50:05 No, go.
01:50:06 Go on.
01:50:07 Go on.
01:50:08 To me, it's like, if you were to say, like, oh, I can't stand when people talk about this
01:50:13 video game.
01:50:14 Like, I never want to hear anybody talk about that game.
01:50:16 Like, it's just a thing you do that you have things to say about, just like anything else.
01:50:21 That's no...
01:50:22 Okay.
01:50:23 Well, this is...
01:50:24 Yeah, you just got it.
01:50:25 What could you have to say about the sex that you have that, like, needs to be brought
01:50:31 to, like, public attention?
01:50:32 Well, I mean, okay, there's a difference between it's not talking in the room and going, like,
01:50:36 hey, everybody, I just fucking...
01:50:38 Fuck the bitch doggy style.
01:50:40 Like, that's annoying.
01:50:41 But, like, having a conversation about sex that you have, like, it's just like having
01:50:47 a conversation about cooking.
01:50:49 Okay, hang on, hang on.
01:50:50 Okay.
01:50:51 I'll train techniques and ideas.
01:50:53 Tell them I'm sorry.
01:50:54 No.
01:50:55 I am not training techniques with any of you fucks.
01:50:58 Get out of here.
01:50:59 You can't wait for me.
01:51:00 Here's one thing that comes to mind.
01:51:01 Okay, one thing that comes to mind immediately about this subject is, like, okay, sex, presumably
01:51:06 with another human being, is an intrinsically private act between those two individuals.
01:51:10 No, it's not intrinsically private.
01:51:13 Of course it is.
01:51:14 No, it's socially private.
01:51:15 What are you talking about?
01:51:16 What are you talking about?
01:51:17 What makes it intrinsically private?
01:51:19 Well, okay, I mean...
01:51:20 Yeah.
01:51:21 Okay, let's just...
01:51:22 Like, is it fair for me to, like, expose deep...
01:51:25 Because I wouldn't want someone to do this to me.
01:51:27 Expose deep nuts.
01:51:28 My sexual performance at, you know, whatever.
01:51:30 Ask permission.
01:51:31 Well, yeah, no, like, yeah, you shouldn't divulge.
01:51:34 What am I going to do with that?
01:51:36 The only thing that makes it quote-unquote intrinsically private is that there's another person that
01:51:40 you have to ask in order to, like...
01:51:42 Well, okay.
01:51:43 Very early into my relationship, I was like, hey, is it okay if I talk about sex that we've
01:51:48 had on our...
01:51:49 On my show?
01:51:50 You know, like...
01:51:51 I guess it's just that the...
01:51:52 My answer to that question is no.
01:51:54 I don't want anyone to know.
01:51:56 Okay, yeah.
01:51:57 So it's different from person to person.
01:51:58 The weirdest part about what you said was the word intrinsic.
01:52:00 Like, there's...
01:52:01 It's not even slightly intrinsic, because if you have a sexually open culture, nobody
01:52:05 would question it if you talked about sex.
01:52:08 Like, there's nothing intrinsic.
01:52:10 It's entirely...
01:52:11 Okay, well, I...
01:52:12 I'm talking about something slightly different.
01:52:14 There's a feeling of vulnerability here, I guess, that I just don't care for personally.
01:52:18 Right.
01:52:19 That's just you, though.
01:52:20 Like, I don't feel vulnerable talking about sex.
01:52:22 It's not just him.
01:52:23 I get that.
01:52:24 Okay.
01:52:25 I think it would be great about talking about my sex life, because I have good sex, and
01:52:28 I want to brag about it.
01:52:29 Enough!
01:52:30 Enough!
01:52:31 No!
01:52:32 It's not about having good sex.
01:52:33 Case important.
01:52:34 There we go.
01:52:35 That's not what this is about.
01:52:36 Why not?
01:52:37 If you...
01:52:38 Okay.
01:52:39 Nobody wants to talk about the food they make if they eat shitty food.
01:52:40 Like, if you make...
01:52:41 If you do something well and you enjoy doing it, you want to talk about it.
01:52:43 Look, I do agree...
01:52:44 That's true for everything.
01:52:45 I agree that society should be more naturalist and everybody should be fucking like animals
01:52:49 in the streets.
01:52:50 I agree with that.
01:52:51 I just don't want to hear about it or talk about it.
01:52:52 That's it.
01:52:53 That's fine.
01:52:54 I don't want to say that.
01:52:55 I'm just imagining...
01:52:56 I'm just imagining a world where people are fucking in the streets and you just pass them
01:53:01 by and make sure they don't talk about it.
01:53:04 It's called the Polinic Girls Attack, and that is the plot.
01:53:07 That's the world that I want.
01:53:08 Wait, wait...
01:53:09 I prefer that one where they just legalized rape.
01:53:11 That's my favorite one.
01:53:12 Have any of you seen the Polinic Girls Attack, which is one of the best Hentai OVA?
01:53:16 No.
01:53:17 No, no, I don't.
01:53:18 No.
01:53:19 It's a show where pollen is personified as naked girls who fuck people randomly.
01:53:23 So if you are allergic to pollen, it just means you're constantly getting fucked by these
01:53:28 hot girls.
01:53:29 And so all over the city, just everyone is just like fucking in the streets or on buses.
01:53:33 You're constantly seeing sex, but everyone's trying to pretend it's not happening and go
01:53:38 about their normal day.
01:53:39 That's hilarious.
01:53:40 That's really cool.
01:53:41 It's really embarrassing for them and stuff.
01:53:43 There'll be people like...
01:53:44 There's a girl in episode either one or two.
01:53:47 But they can't help it.
01:53:48 There's a girl who's on the bus and this boy who she likes sits next to her and she's
01:53:52 like really nervous, but then she has allergies.
01:53:55 So she starts getting fucked in front of him, but it's like by other girl pollen.
01:54:00 So then she's all embarrassed about it, but he's like, no, I understand.
01:54:03 You've got allergies.
01:54:05 He's clearly embarrassed, but he's trying to be strong about it.
01:54:08 It's adorable.
01:54:09 It's a great fucking OVA.
01:54:10 Wait, wait, what's going on?
01:54:11 Is this the thing you wrote?
01:54:12 Sounds like a thing you wrote.
01:54:13 No, it's a really good anime OVA.
01:54:14 Go watch it.
01:54:15 The Polinic Girls Attack.
01:54:16 I don't believe it.
01:54:17 I don't believe this is a good anime OVA.
01:54:18 It's like my favorite porn anime.
01:54:21 I've never heard you talk about it.
01:54:23 What started this in my mind is not like people talking about their sex lives.
01:54:27 What I'm talking about is like a discord channel for posting porn and like being like,
01:54:33 wow, I love that fucking big kiss on that girl.
01:54:36 Like a bunch of guys just all getting around and be like, oh man, look at the vagina on
01:54:40 that one.
01:54:41 Ah, yeah, dude.
01:54:42 Wait, wait, quick question.
01:54:43 How many of you have an NSFW board on your server?
01:54:46 I have two.
01:54:47 I figured you have to have one or else people complain about the lack of it.
01:54:51 People demanded of me and I refuse outright.
01:54:52 Yeah, that's fine.
01:54:53 Oh my God.
01:54:54 No, it's completely normal.
01:54:55 People come in and they see and they're like, okay, cool.
01:54:59 I'm not against it, but yeah, I wouldn't participate in a discussion like that.
01:55:03 For sure.
01:55:04 Yeah, exactly.
01:55:05 I'm not trying to say that it's like morally wrong.
01:55:08 It just grosses me out and I hate you if you do.
01:55:10 Honestly, it's funny.
01:55:11 Don't look at the channel.
01:55:12 You know what's funny?
01:55:13 I don't need to be in part in a community of people posting the porn that they just
01:55:18 nutted to and it's like, oh, maybe there's some good shit in there.
01:55:22 I can find the good shit on my own.
01:55:24 Thank you very much.
01:55:25 It's more about the fact that I just hate people and don't like talking about them.
01:55:29 The purpose of talking about sex is to get sex.
01:55:32 And if I'm not trying to get sex, I don't want to fucking talk to your ass.
01:55:35 Get the fuck away from me.
01:55:36 I basically agree.
01:55:37 More or less.
01:55:38 I don't go out of my way to talk to anybody about sex.
01:55:42 But if sex comes up in conversation.
01:55:44 Right.
01:55:45 Just comes up naturally.
01:55:46 Exactly.
01:55:47 And among certain people, it does if everyone's comfortable.
01:55:50 It's not unusual.
01:55:52 It really comes down to the individual how you feel about it because tons of people are...
01:55:58 I mean, that's true of anything, really.
01:56:00 Any discussion topic.
01:56:01 Some people don't want you to talk about politics in front of them at all.
01:56:04 And some people are eager and not even going to get mad and are just going to have a good
01:56:08 time talking about it.
01:56:10 Same goes for this.
01:56:11 But it's a lot easier to talk about porn than sex because, you know, you can't share your
01:56:17 sexual experiences with someone else directly unless you fuck them too, I guess.
01:56:21 And it won't be the same.
01:56:22 But like, you know, you can always share porn and it's really interesting to...
01:56:28 I like getting porn recommendations.
01:56:30 Like me and my...
01:56:31 Yeah, exactly.
01:56:32 Me and my previous group of friends used to talk about porn at the same time.
01:56:34 It just established the fact that, yeah, we jack off.
01:56:37 And it's like, here's a person that I think people would enjoy.
01:56:40 So you just link that shit into your servers.
01:56:42 Yeah, I'm over that.
01:56:43 That's all it is to me.
01:56:44 In general, I feel.
01:56:45 I mean, I could easily, like, if I saw...
01:56:48 I think I just watched a porn, like, last night that I literally thought Ben would like this.
01:56:53 A porn.
01:56:54 Because it was, you know, some gothy, like, you know, Avril Lavigne looking chic.
01:56:58 And I was just like, yeah, that's a Ben slide if I've ever seen one.
01:57:01 Ben slide allergies.
01:57:04 I don't...
01:57:05 I don't know if I...
01:57:06 I don't like that in porn.
01:57:07 I don't have any particular feeling about that aesthetic in porn.
01:57:11 To me, it's just weird when there's a channel.
01:57:13 And it's like in a friend group of, like, people who I know and I've spoken to,
01:57:17 and I know them on, like, a personal basis.
01:57:19 And I don't know.
01:57:20 I just think it's weird when they're talking about all the people they want to have sex with
01:57:24 and all the things they've had sex with.
01:57:26 I just don't want to hear it.
01:57:27 I just don't think it's cool when I hear it.
01:57:29 You know, like, for me...
01:57:31 Yeah, okay, go ahead.
01:57:32 In my channel, there is no talking.
01:57:34 It's just a slew of pictures.
01:57:36 That's all it is.
01:57:37 That's how it is.
01:57:38 It's way different for me.
01:57:39 For me, it's like when I post a link and then they're like,
01:57:41 oh, fucking love vaginas, dude.
01:57:43 Haha, yeah, dude, me too.
01:57:44 It's like the comments under an ex-hentai, like, individual page of like,
01:57:48 yeah, boy, I also nutted.
01:57:50 I love reading those comments.
01:57:51 I always go to the comments.
01:57:53 It's those comments, but the people who I know,
01:57:57 the people who I know made them.
01:57:59 I don't know.
01:58:00 What has to happen in your life
01:58:02 for you to end up leaving comments on porn videos?
01:58:05 That's a good question.
01:58:06 Some of them have a ton of comments.
01:58:08 It's great, you know, because like,
01:58:10 the assumption is that, you know, they jacked off
01:58:13 and then they somehow weren't ashamed of what they did after they jacked off.
01:58:17 I guess the better question is what has to not happen in your life
01:58:20 for you to end up like that?
01:58:21 Okay, that's exactly what I was going to say, Jesse,
01:58:23 because I, like, the kind of the way I think about it is,
01:58:26 I think about sex this way in general,
01:58:28 when I want sex, like, it consumes my thoughts
01:58:32 and that's what needs to be done.
01:58:33 Once it's done, I become a true philosopher
01:58:36 and it's time to do everything else that matters in life.
01:58:40 And like, when I see people spending time
01:58:42 in like an NSF work chat or whatever,
01:58:45 I'm like, okay, guys, just nut, then you can get on with your day
01:58:48 and you can go like do stuff.
01:58:49 Yeah, it's kind of like, honestly, I think I'm doing a public service.
01:58:53 When at long last I get off, I feel liberated.
01:58:56 I'm like, thank God, I'm free.
01:58:58 Yeah, when you see someone in their everyday life
01:59:01 talking about sex that they're not currently having,
01:59:04 it's like if you saw Superman typing an article
01:59:07 for the Daily Planet in his Superman clothes,
01:59:09 like, what are you doing?
01:59:10 Go out there and save some people and do Superman stuff.
01:59:13 I couldn't deal more.
01:59:14 Get it out of here.
01:59:15 Honestly, like, not only will I,
01:59:18 I will literally stop doing things to go jack off
01:59:22 and go make myself hard to do that, to have fun.
01:59:26 I do that, but I don't feel good about it.
01:59:29 Why not? You're doing it.
01:59:31 Like, why would you do something and then guilt yourself over it?
01:59:34 You already fucking did it.
01:59:36 Well, I only feel guilty because it's like
01:59:39 I could have been doing something better.
01:59:41 I could have not wasted that time, but I did.
01:59:44 You can feel that way about literally every second you spend on this.
01:59:48 Okay, sure.
01:59:49 Every second that you are not genuinely wasting your time.
01:59:52 That's a particularly useless way to spend time.
01:59:55 The whole idea of, like, pornography or, like,
01:59:59 jacking it as it is, being, like, a time-wasting,
02:00:02 it is a time-waster in the sense that you're not making anything,
02:00:06 you're not being productive,
02:00:08 unless you're literally producing life.
02:00:10 Indeed, indeed.
02:00:11 Yes, yes.
02:00:12 But, like, anything, any other thing,
02:00:15 like entertainment in general, is also that.
02:00:18 True.
02:00:19 You're not getting anything out of it necessarily.
02:00:21 No, it's different.
02:00:22 But you need it. You need to entertain yourself.
02:00:24 No, you're clearing your mind. It's better.
02:00:27 Watching a show or something.
02:00:28 At least you can learn something.
02:00:29 At least you're having a new experience.
02:00:31 No, this is fucking, this is a really fucked weird conversation.
02:00:34 And I don't know how to insert myself into it
02:00:36 because I have to talk about sex and nobody wants that.
02:00:39 Insert myself?
02:00:40 No!
02:00:43 I get as much out of having sex as I do out of, like, eating.
02:00:46 Like, you, it's-
02:00:47 Yeah, very little, almost not.
02:00:49 I don't get anything out of eating.
02:00:51 Except that you gotta do it.
02:00:52 Never mind, I forgot, none of you wants to be human at all.
02:00:55 You just want to-
02:00:56 No, whoa, whoa, whoa, Digi!
02:00:57 Do not let me with these fucking vile creatures.
02:00:59 I'm the most human-core person on earth.
02:01:01 Do not say that about me.
02:01:03 Listen, Digi, you're a freak.
02:01:05 You don't like the Organization 13 hoodie,
02:01:07 and you think you get something edifying out of eating a meal.
02:01:11 What do you get out of eating a meal?
02:01:12 Eating a meal is fucking great.
02:01:14 It fulfills you on the same thing.
02:01:16 I'm like a body level.
02:01:17 I'm like a literal physical level.
02:01:19 Eating a meal is only slightly less of a waste of time than jacking off.
02:01:23 If I did have to eat food, I wouldn't do it.
02:01:25 Jacking off is a hurdle in life.
02:01:26 Oh, yeah, for sure.
02:01:27 I mean, sex is an experience.
02:01:28 Sex is a valuable experience.
02:01:29 Jacking off is a hurdle.
02:01:30 Like, I wake up every day of my life and I go,
02:01:33 oh my god, I gotta-
02:01:34 Eating food is a hurdle too.
02:01:35 I gotta eat twice today.
02:01:37 I gotta cum five times.
02:01:38 I gotta shit who knows how many fucking times.
02:01:40 I probably gotta pay some bills.
02:01:41 I spend my whole day waiting for when I get to eat or fuck.
02:01:44 That's all I think about.
02:01:45 Like, all day I'm like, oh, I already ate like three hours ago.
02:01:49 If I eat right now, I'll get fat.
02:01:50 I gotta wait three more hours.
02:01:51 I spend my whole day waiting for the windows between those hurdles
02:01:53 when I can actually do something.
02:01:55 Yeah, I mean, I think that's there for the mindset right there
02:01:58 because I feel like I'm in Jesse's camp there.
02:02:00 Eating, eating is a chore.
02:02:02 I feel exactly the same about eating
02:02:04 as I feel about doing the laundry or buying groceries.
02:02:07 Oh my god.
02:02:08 It makes me sick that like 70% of my day at least
02:02:11 is like coming and eating and shitting.
02:02:13 It's not-
02:02:14 I wish I could just cut it down somehow.
02:02:16 It's not that I don't-
02:02:18 It's not that I don't enjoy the things I eat.
02:02:20 Like, I cook.
02:02:21 Like, I don't just like eat-
02:02:22 I'm not Nate.
02:02:23 I don't just eat beans out of a can.
02:02:24 Like, I do cook something that tastes pretty good
02:02:26 and I like it.
02:02:27 And like, I do enjoy it to a certain extent.
02:02:30 But like I said, if I could not do it, I wouldn't.
02:02:33 Let me introduce a totally different perspective.
02:02:35 And I was talking to Nate about this a little bit yesterday
02:02:37 about how I heavily compartmentalize my life
02:02:39 and I schedule it very heavily.
02:02:41 So what happens for me is that I'm working on stuff
02:02:43 that I feel are conducive to my future, right?
02:02:46 A positive future for me all the time.
02:02:48 And then when I'm not doing that, I'm eating
02:02:50 and I'm watching shit.
02:02:52 So that part of my day is like, that's the unwinding.
02:02:56 That's like a necessary part of my day.
02:02:58 I need it.
02:02:59 So it's like, I don't view eating or like-
02:03:02 Well, what happens when you want to jack off
02:03:04 while you're in your time zone of work time?
02:03:07 What happens then?
02:03:08 What is that?
02:03:09 Like, if you feel like jacking off, as happens to me
02:03:11 while working all the time,
02:03:13 but you're in work time,
02:03:15 do you continue to work and suppress that urge?
02:03:18 Or do you deviate from your schedule to alleviate that issue?
02:03:22 I do it like in the morning, twice a week.
02:03:25 Okay, okay.
02:03:26 Twice a week?
02:03:27 Yeah.
02:03:28 Oh my god, you're a genius.
02:03:30 Yeah.
02:03:31 Nate, I think you make your secret gene.
02:03:33 I have a schedule.
02:03:34 It's like a circadian rhythm.
02:03:36 Wait, in the morning, twice a week.
02:03:39 Oh my god.
02:03:40 I'm so jealous.
02:03:41 I'm so fucking jealous.
02:03:42 I need to give you a piece of advice.
02:03:43 It's going to sound like I'm being insincere,
02:03:45 but I'm completely serious.
02:03:47 If you have an erection and you want to get rid of it,
02:03:50 backhand slap your dick.
02:03:55 I do this all the time.
02:03:57 If I have an unwanted bone or I just slap the shit out of my cock
02:04:00 and it withers up.
02:04:03 All of my bones are unwanted, so maybe I'll try that.
02:04:06 You got to hit it with the knuckles on the back of your hand.
02:04:09 You know what my curse is?
02:04:11 My curse is that I have no heat, so I'm always freezing.
02:04:15 So I always have my hands under my dick where it's warm.
02:04:18 And so from always touching my dick,
02:04:21 it gets hard like 10,000 times a day and I'm like,
02:04:23 oh Jesus, I got to take care of this fucking shit now.
02:04:26 Jesse, do you not have an electric heater?
02:04:29 They're like $60.
02:04:31 What's that?
02:04:33 You go to Walmart and you get a little tower.
02:04:36 No, I have had space heaters and electric heaters.
02:04:39 I can't because the floor is always wet
02:04:42 and flooding up from the tiles.
02:04:44 So if I had a heater, it would be an electrical hazard
02:04:47 and my house would burn down with me in it,
02:04:49 which might be a good thing.
02:04:51 How much flooding is there?
02:04:54 Guys, you don't understand.
02:04:55 I live in a cave.
02:04:57 I live in a bad place.
02:04:59 This is the moral of all of my stories and all of my anecdotes.
02:05:03 Are you wet?
02:05:05 Jesse's basement pretty much floods every single day.
02:05:10 Right, no.
02:05:11 I watched a video where you're playing with the toys
02:05:14 and that is like, is it larger than...?
02:05:16 No, that's a whole different kind.
02:05:17 There are multiple...
02:05:18 No, that's a different kind of flood.
02:05:20 There are multiple kinds of flooding where I live.
02:05:22 There are multiple genres of it.
02:05:24 There's like rainwater and snow water up from the tiles
02:05:27 flooding, which is like all over the room constantly
02:05:29 for like, you know, pretty much all the time.
02:05:31 Pretty much 365.
02:05:32 Then every once in a while there's like the drain.
02:05:35 There's like the drain backs up and like this weird, filthy, smelly sewer water
02:05:39 like comes out in this huge ocean that I don't even notice
02:05:41 because I'm in bed until I smell it and I get up and I go,
02:05:43 oh my god, what the fuck?
02:05:44 And that happens at least around like eight or nine times a year.
02:05:48 Have you considered...?
02:05:50 But there's also the leaky pipes in the ceiling.
02:05:52 There's also the fucking...
02:05:54 What the fuck? If I considered leaving,
02:05:56 what the fuck did you think my catchphrase was?
02:05:58 Help, let me out for you dumbass!
02:06:00 I say that at the end of every video.
02:06:02 Help, I've been saying it for...
02:06:04 I've been saying it for three years.
02:06:05 Help, let me out!
02:06:07 I just...
02:06:08 I just don't know why you're still there.
02:06:10 Because it costs money.
02:06:11 Everything in life costs money.
02:06:13 A lot of fucking money and it's impossible.
02:06:15 Okay, fair enough.
02:06:17 Um...
02:06:18 No, no, no, but I'm just trying to understand from like a logistical standpoint
02:06:21 because like, how many inches were like even...
02:06:24 Well, not feet, but like how many inches is it?
02:06:26 Because like, you could just get a stand and put the electric heater on top of that, right?
02:06:29 What? I...
02:06:30 What? I don't want to talk about this anymore.
02:06:32 I feel exposed. I feel fucking...
02:06:34 I don't like this.
02:06:35 Fair enough.
02:06:36 I don't like where this is going.
02:06:37 Hey, I got a funny story.
02:06:38 I just wanted to recommend an electric heater because I also have no heat,
02:06:40 no central heat in my head.
02:06:41 I was just trying to make a funny joke about my hand being in my pants all day.
02:06:45 Okay, listen to my funny story everybody.
02:06:51 Here it comes, okay.
02:06:53 This is the joke, the funny story.
02:06:56 So this is a story Michelle told me.
02:06:58 Okay, Munchy, let's perk up those fat fucking ears and listen to this goddamn tale.
02:07:03 I'm not going to like this.
02:07:04 This is what I'm going to make you say.
02:07:05 You're going to like it.
02:07:06 Okay, so Michelle's been going on and on about how her hot coworker is so damn hot.
02:07:11 Her new coworker, female coworker incidentally.
02:07:14 Michelle is gay, definitely.
02:07:16 And so basically, she was stalking her Instagram as she often does
02:07:22 and she scrolls down and she's like, yeah, looking good.
02:07:24 Looking good.
02:07:25 I'm like, yeah, that's fine.
02:07:26 And then all of a sudden, she spies something that looks a little strange.
02:07:29 What is this?
02:07:31 This hot, tall, model-shaped coworker of hers.
02:07:35 Why is her skin gray in this one picture?
02:07:38 What's happening in this particular, what's going on?
02:07:41 Oh, fuck yes.
02:07:42 And then she scrolls a little bit more.
02:07:43 Are those horns on her head?
02:07:46 What's happening here?
02:07:47 That's so glorious.
02:07:48 And she scrolls down even more.
02:07:49 Okay, glasses, a big blue arrow on her chest.
02:07:52 It's Equious Cosplay by dude.
02:07:55 Homestuck.
02:07:56 She's a homestuck freak.
02:07:58 Her weird hot coworker.
02:08:00 Is she single?
02:08:02 Is she single?
02:08:04 Wait, I have a very question.
02:08:07 Could Michelle get her number maybe?
02:08:09 Is she muscular?
02:08:11 I mean, maybe for a girl kind of, but not really.
02:08:14 No.
02:08:15 It's not a one-to-one accurate cosplay, tragically.
02:08:18 That's really cool.
02:08:19 She also did karate.
02:08:20 And it's really funny, and you know, good job, I guess.
02:08:23 I mean...
02:08:30 I laughed.
02:08:31 It was, of all the trolls, Equious was the first one,
02:08:34 the only good homestuck character,
02:08:36 and that's all I have to say about that.
02:08:38 I'm glad, you know, I'm glad.
02:08:39 I feel like, you know, Equious needs love.
02:08:41 He does.
02:08:42 Equious needs love.
02:08:43 He's underappreciated, but the only good character.
02:08:44 Oh my God.
02:08:45 Shout out to Econ for saying that homestuck,
02:08:48 everything after Act 4 is bad.
02:08:50 Shout out to him for ruining my life.
02:08:52 Appreciate that, Econ.
02:08:53 Way to go.
02:08:54 Thanks for ruining Munch's life, Econ.
02:08:57 Here's another fun fact.
02:08:59 I did 100 pull-ups yesterday over a 12-hour span.
02:09:02 That was hard, and my body was giving out...
02:09:04 How many in a row?
02:09:05 How many in a row?
02:09:06 I've been doing in batches of 10.
02:09:07 Batches of 10.
02:09:08 So, you know, nothing crazy.
02:09:10 I think this is the perfect time.
02:09:12 Nate, I quite literally cannot do 10 push-ups.
02:09:15 What should I do?
02:09:16 10 push-ups, you say.
02:09:17 I did 10 push-ups the other day.
02:09:19 They were really wide, too.
02:09:20 I did 10 push-ups really wide.
02:09:22 You're supposed to do them tight to your shoulders.
02:09:24 Wide is way harder.
02:09:25 Well, I mean, it's just a different exercise to do them wide.
02:09:27 Okay, so like...
02:09:28 How do I get up to a level break?
02:09:30 My arms are sore the next day.
02:09:31 I feel really good.
02:09:32 10 out of 10.
02:09:33 My arms feel immediately sore.
02:09:35 Okay, no problem.
02:09:36 We just have to do it every single day,
02:09:38 and it will be easier every day, and you can do more.
02:09:40 Yeah, that's all I'm going to say.
02:09:41 Yeah, I know.
02:09:42 I watch BoJack Horseman.
02:09:43 Let's just say your goal is do 10 push-ups in a row,
02:09:45 okay, or 100, or whatever, whatever the goal is.
02:09:48 Okay, like however many you can do in a row,
02:09:51 do that, then rest, then do it again,
02:09:54 and like wait another...
02:09:55 And I'd say like do like three sets or whatever.
02:09:57 I don't know, do like 10 sets, whatever you want to do.
02:09:59 Although I guess I'd say don't even go to failure,
02:10:03 because you want to be able to do it like every day
02:10:05 so that you are recovering every day.
02:10:07 So like, I don't know, maybe you can do five.
02:10:09 Do five in a row.
02:10:10 Maybe five is too much.
02:10:11 Just as many as you can basically.
02:10:13 Chain them together.
02:10:14 So what's the wait time between like...
02:10:16 Well, like at the gym, I wait about one minute
02:10:20 or a minute and 30 seconds between sets.
02:10:22 So that seems pretty reasonable, I'd say.
02:10:25 Just to speak on push-ups in particular,
02:10:27 because every time I've tried to get into working out,
02:10:30 I always start with push-ups,
02:10:32 and I start by doing like 10 the first day,
02:10:35 trying to do another set,
02:10:37 and then it's like, oh, I can't do more.
02:10:38 But then the next day, I can...
02:10:40 The growth is so fast in the ability to do push-ups
02:10:43 that usually by like day three,
02:10:45 I can easily do three sets of 10.
02:10:47 After a week, I could probably do close to 100.
02:10:50 It's almost as though it's just your muscles
02:10:54 getting used to the motion more so than actually bulking out.
02:10:57 It is.
02:10:58 This is like when people start working out,
02:11:01 I remember when I was reading starting strength and stuff,
02:11:04 like a starting lifter, like squats.
02:11:07 Their squat increases like a huge amount really early on,
02:11:10 and it's not because they're getting super strong
02:11:12 and getting huge muscle growth,
02:11:13 it's just because their body is learning how to do it.
02:11:16 I honestly feel like I've become an expert in starting strength
02:11:18 because of the fact that I've only ever had starting strength,
02:11:22 and then I just let it go, deteriorate.
02:11:24 So I work out for like a couple months,
02:11:26 and I get that nice,
02:11:28 oh yeah, things are going great,
02:11:30 and then you hit the slump of,
02:11:32 oh well, now you're no longer in the starting,
02:11:34 it's no longer fast, and then I go,
02:11:36 oh well, I'm not noticing progress anymore.
02:11:39 By the way, the reason I brought this story-
02:11:41 The master of being adequate.
02:11:43 The story was not to actually salute myself
02:11:45 because actually I was attempting to hit 150 yesterday total,
02:11:50 but I simply hit the wall, and it was weird.
02:11:53 It was different than like when you're at the gym
02:11:55 and you're doing like, you're going to failure over like three sets,
02:11:58 and you're, I don't know, benching, I don't know,
02:12:00 like a couple plates or whatever,
02:12:02 whatever, I'm not that strong or anything.
02:12:04 Like 180 pounds or something.
02:12:06 And like you do that, and like you hit the wall
02:12:08 after like 10 reps, and you just can't go more.
02:12:10 This was very different.
02:12:12 This was like, every time I came back to it,
02:12:14 like my baseline strength was much diminished,
02:12:17 which was different from like feeling strong at the beginning,
02:12:20 and then getting weaker.
02:12:22 I've like never worked out this way,
02:12:24 and I'm honestly doing it as a meme, as a joke.
02:12:26 It's not optimal, but I just felt like fucking doing it.
02:12:29 Because yeah, I was thinking, my goal one day
02:12:31 is to do a hundred pull-ups in a row
02:12:33 like level one Zell from Final Fantasy VIII,
02:12:35 as I've said.
02:12:37 That is my goal.
02:12:39 And if I do a hundred in a day,
02:12:41 really all I have to do is slowly narrow the window
02:12:43 between those sets until it's nothing at all, right?
02:12:46 So, maybe that'll be my approach.
02:12:49 And David Goggins.
02:12:51 Is that a thing humans can do as a hundred pull-ups?
02:12:54 People have absolutely done more than a hundred pull-ups.
02:12:57 A friend of mine used to drive out
02:12:59 to Mount Shashmore back in Virginia Beach
02:13:01 just to use their pull-up bar to do a hundred pull-ups.
02:13:04 So he would do it in a row?
02:13:06 I don't think he did them in a row, but he would do...
02:13:08 He would do it in like twenty minutes or so.
02:13:11 Okay, well that's already pretty impressive to do it in that short of a time.
02:13:14 He would just do sets of ten, rest a minute, do another set of ten.
02:13:17 But he had huge fucking arms, you know?
02:13:20 Sure, sure.
02:13:22 Like I've said, when I was in middle school, my record was fifty.
02:13:25 So I know this is attainable.
02:13:27 You know, I was like a skinny guy, but I was like a little exercise boy.
02:13:30 My record was seven, like last year when we had...
02:13:34 When Ben and...
02:13:36 That's already way better than most people.
02:13:38 Yeah, well we had a pull-up bar set up in the middle of the house,
02:13:41 in the passage from the kitchen to the living room.
02:13:44 So every time you pass it, you're just tempted to do a pull-up anyway.
02:13:47 The only problem with pull-ups is that unlike push-ups,
02:13:50 it takes way longer to recover from doing a set...
02:13:53 like a day of pull-ups.
02:13:55 You can't just do it every single day.
02:13:57 It involves more muscles probably.
02:13:59 I'll do one pull-up one day, and then the next day I can't even lift myself.
02:14:03 You know what's the weirdest thing though?
02:14:05 After yesterday, it's not my arms that hurt, it's my abs.
02:14:08 My abs are wrecked, because I never do ab exercises, because I'm an idiot, but you know.
02:14:13 Oh, it hurts. Anyway, enough of that shit.
02:14:16 I just thought that was cool and funny.
02:14:18 I'll get back to you folks when I am a Final Fantasy character.
02:14:21 How do you know that Zell did them contiguously, consecutively?
02:14:25 You know, I suppose I should double-check that, because I remember thinking that.
02:14:29 They said that, quote, something like, Zell jumped up and did 100 pull-ups,
02:14:33 but I suppose they never said he didn't come down in between, or like shake a break.
02:14:38 I don't really remember. Don't you just kind of like come into the scene,
02:14:41 and he's going like 98, 99, 100. Yeah, 100 pull-ups.
02:14:45 Maybe. I can't remember.
02:14:47 What I remember is it being a scene where they shake.
02:14:50 Yeah, like the implication in that kind of thing is always that they do it continuously.
02:14:56 Yeah, I would. And I know humans have done it and can do it, so, you know.
02:15:01 Alright, fair. Man.
02:15:04 Yeah, the reason I just, yeah, it was just like one more thing.
02:15:07 The reason that I started wanting to do push-ups is that my brother, he's fucking jacked.
02:15:12 Oh, yeah?
02:15:13 Yeah, and we're pretty much opposites.
02:15:16 Like, he's jacked in short. I'm skinny and tall.
02:15:19 So I'm just like, well, I want to be tall and muscular to some extent.
02:15:24 Good idea.
02:15:25 You know?
02:15:26 It's a good combo.
02:15:27 Yeah, just so I can hold it over my brother, because he can't get taller.
02:15:29 He's older than me.
02:15:30 That is cool.
02:15:32 No, let him have this. Let him have this.
02:15:34 Is he older or younger?
02:15:36 He's older.
02:15:37 He's older.
02:15:38 Both of my younger brothers are taller and in better shape than me.
02:15:41 What do?
02:15:43 Exercise. That's all I mean. That's all you got.
02:15:45 I want to do a marathon.
02:15:47 We're heels like Tom Cruise.
02:15:51 Yeah.
02:15:53 Base Tom.
02:15:55 He's my god, my icon.
02:15:57 I mean, I'm out of shit to say people.
02:16:00 I mean, we could do more or we could go to questions.
02:16:02 Wait, wait, wait.
02:16:04 I got one thing to say.
02:16:06 For the benefit of the viewers.
02:16:10 Zen Hoxtable, who are you?
02:16:12 I am a guy.
02:16:14 Well, a lot of people, for people who haven't heard this already,
02:16:18 a lot of people said I'm an anti-Tuber.
02:16:20 I wouldn't really identify as an anti-Tuber.
02:16:22 I don't think you're an anti-Tuber.
02:16:24 Yeah, I'm not really an anti-Tuber.
02:16:26 I make videos on animation because just for sake of clarification,
02:16:31 I'm in college for animation right now.
02:16:34 I'm just very interested in that kind of thing.
02:16:36 So it's not just animation videos.
02:16:38 I also do music theory because I played the piano for about,
02:16:43 I think, 12 years now.
02:16:45 So I just know about a lot of that stuff.
02:16:47 And I think that's a valuable thing to a lot of people.
02:16:50 I mostly know you from your drawings on Twitter.
02:16:53 Yes, I need to start posting more of those.
02:16:56 I'm a really big fan of them.
02:16:58 You have a really great, you have a lot of motion.
02:17:01 They're very, very kinetic.
02:17:03 They have a lot of motion to them.
02:17:05 Thank you.
02:17:07 I know basically nothing about you career-wise.
02:17:09 Yeah, I've heard that you have a comic.
02:17:11 I haven't checked it out yet.
02:17:13 Yeah, I did this comic for Inktober.
02:17:16 That was a lot of fun.
02:17:18 Zen is a bit of a human content machine type of guy.
02:17:22 Yeah, just not explicitly YouTubers, whatever I can.
02:17:26 Oh my god, this is beautiful.
02:17:28 Hey, I know nothing about you career-wise.
02:17:30 I'm sure that you have great opinions about Doug.
02:17:36 I'm sure everyone knows you and you're a great cartoon person.
02:17:39 That's not the way Zen Huxable is not that guy.
02:17:42 His videos are totally different from anyone else on YouTube.
02:17:46 Okay, okay.
02:17:48 All I'm saying is that I'm sure your videos are nice and great
02:17:52 and you're a good person.
02:17:54 But all I know is that I've hung out with you a couple of times
02:17:57 before in Boston and you're funny and cool.
02:18:00 And the thing that strikes me most is that you're happy
02:18:02 and you enjoy doing things.
02:18:04 Which is the best thing in a person.
02:18:07 None of my friends are happy.
02:18:09 No one in this call is happy.
02:18:11 No one's happy.
02:18:13 They're all fucking mean and mean.
02:18:16 I'm a ray of sunshine.
02:18:18 I feel like I'm happier than Zen overall in terms of,
02:18:21 like maybe I don't portray the...
02:18:23 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:18:24 No, probably in like quality of life and just like, you know,
02:18:27 having your needs fulfilled, you're probably happier than I am.
02:18:30 I think, sure.
02:18:31 Zen is just extremely personal.
02:18:33 Like, Zen is a...
02:18:35 Zen's just like, he likes people a lot.
02:18:37 That's probably what I'd use to be happy.
02:18:40 Yeah, that's what I think you're connecting with there.
02:18:43 Because I think I'm happier than anyone I know.
02:18:45 But...
02:18:46 Probably, yeah.
02:18:47 And I still have to be happy and miserable all the time.
02:18:50 I have to ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds
02:18:54 and everyone's too scared to ask you.
02:18:56 Who is the sexy lady in your YouTube...
02:18:59 Oh my God, thank you for asking.
02:19:01 Wow, there we go.
02:19:02 Oh, it's Tycho Nuki.
02:19:03 This is...
02:19:04 Yeah, Tycho Nuki.
02:19:05 She's my favorite artist.
02:19:07 I don't know.
02:19:08 She's a...
02:19:09 Okay.
02:19:10 Oh, fantastic.
02:19:11 It's all over...
02:19:12 It's not plastic love.
02:19:13 That's Maria Takayuchi.
02:19:14 Oh, I just thought it was the same person this whole time.
02:19:17 No, it's not.
02:19:18 It's not, no.
02:19:19 Well, that explains why she looks like nothing like her.
02:19:21 But...
02:19:22 Yeah, she looks nothing like her.
02:19:23 That was the one gap in the theory.
02:19:25 Well, they sound fairly similar.
02:19:27 I would say...
02:19:28 Not really, actually.
02:19:29 Tycho Nuki has a...
02:19:30 She played me one of her albums at my house, right?
02:19:33 Yeah, I did.
02:19:34 I think I played Sunshine Hour.
02:19:36 That's Tycho Nuki's first solo album because she's...
02:19:38 Okay, now we're getting into this shit.
02:19:40 Okay, so...
02:19:41 I can't believe I just stuck in the same person this whole time.
02:19:44 Yeah.
02:19:45 Remember when I went to your house and we were talking about how Japanese artists released
02:19:49 a lot of music?
02:19:50 Yeah.
02:19:51 Yeah, okay.
02:19:52 So there was this music movement in the mid-70s to late-80s.
02:19:56 It was called City Pop.
02:19:57 And there were a bunch of artists that spanned from it.
02:19:59 It was like a Kiko Yano type sort of in my life.
02:20:02 This is just like for the people in the comments, just for gratification, like hearing the names
02:20:06 on the podcast.
02:20:08 It's like all these types of people that make like fantastic pop music that was really inventive
02:20:14 at the same time.
02:20:15 Like, they were experiencing...
02:20:17 They were experimenting with just different musical cultures as well.
02:20:24 And yeah, it's like if you like City Pop, you're pretty much set for music for the next
02:20:30 10 years, at least, because there's just so much of it.
02:20:34 They're like 30 artists that are fucking fantastic and they all have like 12 albums.
02:20:40 So it's just great stuff.
02:20:42 Beautiful.
02:20:43 And Taiko Nuki's my favorite because her voice is fantastic.
02:20:46 Okay, but that...
02:20:47 She made 4AM if you're familiar with that.
02:20:49 Plastic Love is a City Pop song.
02:20:51 Yeah, it's a City Pop song.
02:20:52 Okay.
02:20:53 I'm really off base saying that they are similar.
02:20:56 Yeah.
02:20:57 Yeah, there's like instrumentally and sonically, there's not really a unifying signifier of
02:21:06 City Pop.
02:21:07 So it's like, it's sort of a stupid term other than it's like, oh, there are these artists.
02:21:11 It's more of a movement.
02:21:12 Well, John, that's what you say.
02:21:14 That's John is for you, I guess.
02:21:16 Right.
02:21:17 That's like, it's even more nebulous for City Pop, that's the thing.
02:21:20 I'm reading some of your comic right now.
02:21:22 And your art style strikes a very specific chord in my brain.
02:21:26 Your art style is artists from like 5 or 6 years ago that used to be good, but now is
02:21:32 shit, but like you have the art style of the old good one.
02:21:35 You know what I'm saying?
02:21:36 Okay.
02:21:37 I know what you're saying.
02:21:38 Okay.
02:21:39 So you go to fucking ask Leon, the best Homestuck ask blog, and the art so scribbly and ridiculous
02:21:47 and funny and cool.
02:21:48 And then you go to their new shit.
02:21:50 Like clean and crisp and fucking ah, you went to art school and now your life's ruined.
02:21:55 But now you got scribbly shit.
02:21:57 It's messy, but super aesthetic and great.
02:21:59 I would tell you that.
02:22:00 So you have like all, you have all like earlys to 2010s art style.
02:22:04 Please never get better.
02:22:06 Zen's art style is indicative of his content on the whole.
02:22:10 It's all very unkempt, very like lightly edited, very like rambling and.
02:22:17 I'm not a polished guy.
02:22:18 Yeah.
02:22:19 Like Zen will like stumble into a video, like literally stumble into the frame in a video,
02:22:24 like rambling, popping his mic and just like going, going insane.
02:22:29 And like you, a lot of the times you're not even, if it weren't for the title of the video,
02:22:33 you'd have no idea what the fuck this video is about until you get real into it.
02:22:38 I love it.
02:22:39 It reminds me.
02:22:40 It's in the same way of what you were just saying.
02:22:43 It reminds me of like older YouTube.
02:22:44 It reminds me of like before everybody was trying to be the most polished.
02:22:47 And the thing is, I don't think you need to do all that extra shit that they do now.
02:22:52 No, absolutely not.
02:22:53 Exactly.
02:22:54 Yeah.
02:22:55 Like there's a core that people resonate with.
02:22:57 And it's like, just leave all the window dressing and like leave the essential.
02:23:01 Yeah.
02:23:02 It's almost like.
02:23:03 I think that's a good approach to just art in general.
02:23:05 Absolutely.
02:23:06 Yeah.
02:23:07 It's almost like the level of polish in certain things like YouTube is like a mark of this
02:23:13 person doesn't know what they're talking about.
02:23:14 They're just doing everything that they're supposed to do.
02:23:16 Because how can you have time to actually research a subject if you have to put out
02:23:21 three videos a week that are fully like animated?
02:23:24 You know, like these people are doing like full editing animations.
02:23:27 It's like, dude, I know that you didn't research this thing.
02:23:31 Unless like, because it used to be that you'd get one of those, like it used to be such
02:23:35 an event to get a 30 minute video from a YouTuber because they were going to put as much effort
02:23:40 into that 30 minutes as they would have put into like a two minute animation, you know?
02:23:44 And so it would be like a six month process where they did all the research and they made
02:23:49 it fucking entertaining from start to finish.
02:23:51 And then like, I don't mind that there's now a culture of like 30 minute analysis videos
02:23:57 that don't have all that extra shit that are just like set to video game footage and it's
02:24:01 just a guy talking.
02:24:02 That's fine with me, but I feel like we've like that other thing is like disappearing
02:24:07 like the extremely well made video in favor of like chopping that up into pieces, making
02:24:15 it look as fancy as possible while having as little content as possible.
02:24:20 Just like putting as many...
02:24:22 When you're talking about those old videos, I'm assuming you're like referring to Sequelitis
02:24:25 and shit, right?
02:24:26 You cut out when you said a name.
02:24:28 I said when you, yeah, Sequelitis.
02:24:30 Yes, like the Sequelitis style, which was, which kind of like kicked off that, you know,
02:24:35 on YouTube, like especially in the gaming sphere doing like longer form videos.
02:24:39 And it used to be that because in early YouTube, the wisdom was you can't make long videos.
02:24:44 It was always that you had to make short stuff because people are mostly watching it on like
02:24:49 their phone during a lunch break or something.
02:24:51 And like, nobody would click on your video if it was more than like 15 minutes.
02:24:55 And so it was like, if you were doing more than that, then you really needed to make it
02:25:00 worth their time by putting more effort.
02:25:03 But now...
02:25:06 Right.
02:25:08 Yeah, like the original Plinket videos are releasing like seven parts.
02:25:11 So, like, I like that it has, that we have normalized longer content and that there's more
02:25:17 of it coming out.
02:25:18 But I just, I feel as though the way that YouTube is structured right now, it's so disincentivized
02:25:24 to ever make a like big epic video that no one's going to fucking do it anymore unless
02:25:30 they're doing it in the background like Nate and it takes twice as long as it even would
02:25:33 have before because he has to make Wiago and shit, you know.
02:25:36 Right, for sure.
02:25:37 Viewers, please open up the show notes so that this audio section makes sense.
02:25:41 How do you go from this to this?
02:25:47 Oh, that's what you're talking about.
02:25:49 Okay.
02:25:50 Gotcha.
02:25:51 Yeah, it's, it's...
02:25:52 I mean, the second one's not bad.
02:25:54 It's not bad, but it's way different and not as cool.
02:25:58 The background and the character art, it just doesn't match.
02:26:01 Yeah, not at all.
02:26:02 Yeah, the background looks great.
02:26:03 It looks almost like weird filters on it, like a weird, bizarre bloom.
02:26:07 Yeah.
02:26:08 It's muddy.
02:26:09 It's a muddy image.
02:26:10 No, it's just like, I feel like they're in like this sort of metamorphosis where they're
02:26:14 getting the handle on that sort of background thing.
02:26:17 But look at this old shit.
02:26:19 It's so colorful and beautiful and sketchy and energetic.
02:26:23 Oh my God.
02:26:24 Yeah.
02:26:25 I think people just get like, they don't want to be complacent.
02:26:29 It's like, yeah, they got bored with this style because they were just doing it so much.
02:26:32 I would never say this art's bad because I don't even think it's bad.
02:26:34 I'm just saying it's different.
02:26:36 No, I get what you're saying.
02:26:37 I get what you're saying.
02:26:38 It's like, they're just leaving something that they were comfortable with for something
02:26:41 that's, you know, different.
02:26:42 Give, give, give.
02:26:43 Trample on him.
02:26:44 Trample on him, give.
02:26:45 Just say your thing.
02:26:46 Just crush him.
02:26:47 Nah, go for it.
02:26:48 No, crush.
02:26:49 I pretty much finished my thought.
02:26:50 Don't worry.
02:26:51 Okay, good.
02:26:52 I was waiting for it.
02:26:53 The other day, relating to this, I uploaded an image of a character I designed called
02:27:00 Clarissa Gunsmoke.
02:27:02 Yeah.
02:27:03 On Twitter.
02:27:04 That was cool.
02:27:05 Yeah, and everyone loves it.
02:27:07 And it was like, oh, wow, cool.
02:27:09 And the reason it's interesting to me, because it's like a really sketchy drawing, but it's
02:27:13 like, she's got a big hat that covers her face and she's got a little smile and she's
02:27:18 got a gun.
02:27:19 And she's got big red hair, big poofy red hair.
02:27:21 She's cool.
02:27:22 She's got long legs.
02:27:23 She's got long legs, too.
02:27:24 A big horse.
02:27:25 Yes, yes.
02:27:26 For a while, I was...
02:27:27 It's got big hair.
02:27:28 Yes.
02:27:29 And for a while, I was like, man, I want to be good.
02:27:32 I want to be like, after my current comic is done, which is basically a comic that involves
02:27:38 a stick figure with a pumpkin face, I want to draw real arms and legs and stuff.
02:27:43 I want to have proper good art.
02:27:46 I want to be getting better at art by making art.
02:27:49 And a lot of the time, I get stuck thinking about the wrong sort of things.
02:27:55 I was trying to design this cowgirl character to have eyes and eyelashes and pupils with
02:28:01 the shines in the pupils.
02:28:04 And then I was like, I don't know how to make this look good.
02:28:07 I'll just hide her face, because I can't fucking draw.
02:28:10 And then everybody loves it.
02:28:11 Yeah, maybe...
02:28:12 Yeah, that's what you do.
02:28:14 That's what great art is.
02:28:15 Great art is like, the artist works within whatever limitations they have.
02:28:19 Have you seen that video, Ben?
02:28:20 That's been circulating around Twitter.
02:28:22 It's about this guy.
02:28:23 He's like a character designer for anime.
02:28:25 He was like...
02:28:26 The...
02:28:27 I've seen that.
02:28:28 Yeah, the anime designers these days are being so ornate.
02:28:31 Just draw a hat over the eyes if you can't draw eyes in size.
02:28:34 No, I haven't.
02:28:35 I haven't seen this.
02:28:36 I just want to say real quick that what makes Hippo's design so good is that you can tell
02:28:41 that character's personality instantly.
02:28:44 Like the second you look at her, you're like, I could fucking write a story about this character.
02:28:48 I know her so well.
02:28:50 There's so much conveyed in the...
02:28:51 It's like a very specific brand of cool.
02:28:55 And even for me, the context of knowing Hippo drew it adds a lot as well, because it's
02:29:00 clearly his type of character.
02:29:01 And I can imagine how he would write her in a story.
02:29:05 So it's like, I think that all that contributes a lot.
02:29:10 And looking at these ones that Munchie had posted earlier, it's like the first one has
02:29:15 these very instantly readable, likable expressions that you immediately know what's going on.
02:29:21 And then this other one...
02:29:22 You can click on it and there are more images than you're still in the preview, but go ahead.
02:29:25 But the other one, it has a great facial expression, but you wouldn't...
02:29:29 You don't notice that because you're too busy looking at all this other shit going on.
02:29:35 And I just think that putting the emotion to the forefront is always going to be the
02:29:40 best.
02:29:41 Any good drawing, it's always going to be like, can we capture the feeling of this?
02:29:48 I feel like the images much more close to the art equivalent of what we've been talking
02:29:52 about with YouTube.
02:29:55 There's all that extra production put into the second image, where the core of the first
02:29:59 one is right there.
02:30:00 Yeah, I think that's the context in which he brought it up.
02:30:05 Yeah.
02:30:06 Okay, what I'm about to say feels wrong.
02:30:09 And I value technical skill.
02:30:13 I don't want to be the guy who just says, oh, just fucking draw cartoons because it's
02:30:17 all you need to know.
02:30:18 No, I...
02:30:19 Technical skill and anatomy and all that is extremely important.
02:30:21 However, there's been a thought in my mind that's hard for me to argue with myself, despite
02:30:27 how much I want to.
02:30:28 And that's if someone can understand, literally get what you're drawing.
02:30:36 Why would you spend more time doing it?
02:30:38 The only purpose of technical skill is so that you can convey more difficult things.
02:30:49 Like, there's some things that you just...
02:30:51 If I'm trying to draw a fight scene, for instance, a lot of people have noted about
02:30:56 One Punch Man that the original webcomic, in spite of looking like shit, is great because
02:31:03 the layouts are so good.
02:31:05 And the guy has such a good knack for...
02:31:08 It's basically a storyboard of a better comic, but the storyboards are good.
02:31:12 There are panels of official Hunter Hunter printed in Shonen Jump that are worse than
02:31:15 the web novel and drawings of One's Eye.
02:31:19 Fair.
02:31:20 But yeah, those drawings resonated with people, and it's obvious that the reason they had
02:31:27 to turn it into something that was better drawn was just so that more people would show
02:31:32 it respect and appreciate it, it would be more saleable because nobody's going to take
02:31:37 a risk on something that looks like that.
02:31:39 But it's just, I think, a general lack of understanding of what even is a good art.
02:31:45 What does it mean for something to be good?
02:31:47 I'm planning to actually make a video about this soon called Bad Looking Anime or something
02:31:54 like that and just explain how all these people get jizzed about Sakuga these days,
02:32:00 but there's so many times where you guys never heard that one, but...
02:32:07 No, I've never heard that one.
02:32:09 PCP Episode 145, get in jizz.
02:32:12 Oh, yes, that's great.
02:32:14 People get jizzed over Sakuga's face.
02:32:18 There he goes again!
02:32:20 I saw it regularly, I'm surprised you never heard me.
02:32:24 I think the word you're looking for is jazzed, but whatever.
02:32:26 No, jizz.
02:32:27 You're jizzing over it.
02:32:29 I've had friends say this all the time.
02:32:32 Maybe it's a Virginia thing.
02:32:33 I have no idea.
02:32:34 I think it's a huge thing.
02:32:36 It could be that I made it up.
02:32:38 My friends said it back in high school, but anyway, yeah, I think they get so excited
02:32:44 about seeing something moving a whole lot and they're like, oh, it has great animation.
02:32:48 I'm like, no, it's just moving a lot.
02:32:51 There's no emotion being conveyed or it's a confusing emotion or the weight is wrong
02:32:56 or it's floaty.
02:32:58 There's a fight scene in Episode 3 of Boogie Pop, which the whole show looks fucking terrible,
02:33:04 but there's a scene where they put all this super animated segment, but it looks awful.
02:33:11 Everything's moving, but none of it looks good.
02:33:14 I've seen shows where they're just parallaxing backgrounds and it looks amazing.
02:33:20 Just moving three different background layers to reveal something and I'm like, that's better
02:33:25 animation to me than this is.
02:33:27 Oh, I'm sort of related in the sense that it's a good looking anime.
02:33:32 I was recently watching Penning Socking again.
02:33:36 I was rewatching it and it is like the best anime ever made.
02:33:41 It looks beautiful.
02:33:42 Have you seen Dead Leaves yet?
02:33:43 Are you watching the dub or the sub?
02:33:45 Well, here's my experience with it.
02:33:48 I'm watching it with Kazzy and I had originally watched it sub, but she's a dub person, so
02:33:54 I tried to watch the dub and I couldn't do it.
02:33:56 I was gonna say, I thought you would hate the dub.
02:33:58 Yeah.
02:33:59 Yeah.
02:34:00 Munchy.
02:34:01 Munchy.
02:34:02 Are you aware of Dead Leaves?
02:34:03 Here's a quick take.
02:34:04 No, no.
02:34:05 I'm aware of it.
02:34:06 I know what it is, but I had not.
02:34:07 It's only 30 minutes.
02:34:08 Go watch it.
02:34:09 It's the most aesthetically pleasing thing I've ever seen.
02:34:10 If it's only 30 minutes, I will do it after the show.
02:34:13 Dead?
02:34:14 All right.
02:34:15 Oh, actually the puppy ball is after this.
02:34:16 Imagine if Candy and Stocking had been like overclocked highest possible quality the
02:34:23 whole way through.
02:34:24 Basically.
02:34:25 Hmm.
02:34:26 I like that.
02:34:27 I like that a lot.
02:34:28 I thought it was a show.
02:34:29 I was mistaken.
02:34:30 Here's a quick take.
02:34:31 See if you agree with me.
02:34:37 Ideally, Solider should have looked like Dead Leaves.
02:34:43 Of course.
02:34:44 Solider, huh?
02:34:45 I mean, the Solider manga has the coolest aesthetic ever.
02:34:50 Aside from the early chat, it takes a while for him to get his faces looking good.
02:34:55 But yeah, I fucking love Solider.
02:34:57 I've never read the manga for Solider.
02:35:00 Oh, dude.
02:35:01 It's way better than the anime.
02:35:04 The unfortunate thing about the anime is they did the coloring really well in the show,
02:35:09 but just in general, the way that they adapted, it really suffers from moving manga problems
02:35:16 where there's a lot of stuff that in the manga is just really tiny side dialogue that
02:35:23 ...
02:35:24 Oh, I know all about that.
02:35:25 Actually, I made a video about this.
02:35:26 My video ...
02:35:27 You did.
02:35:28 I watched it.
02:35:29 What the fuck was it called?
02:35:30 I don't remember.
02:35:31 Was it the ...
02:35:32 It was the difference between anime and manga pacing.
02:35:33 I know the one.
02:35:34 Yeah.
02:35:35 Well, I used Solider as the example in that, where I was talking about how in the first
02:35:37 chapter, there's these parts where Shinigami is chopping the dad or whatever and costing
02:35:43 him.
02:35:44 In the manga, it's this tiny-ass panel that's in between the action happening, so you just
02:35:48 kind of gloss over it.
02:35:49 You don't really pay attention.
02:35:50 But in the anime, they have to make that a full-screen, fully-voiced, animated thing
02:35:54 that takes 10 seconds.
02:35:55 Right.
02:35:56 And it feels way more ...
02:35:57 Yeah.
02:35:58 I don't know.
02:35:59 Cheesy.
02:36:00 It totally takes away from the tone of the episode.
02:36:01 The anime gets better as it goes, but the manga ... The thing about the anime is that
02:36:05 it stops right before the arachnophobia arc, which is by far the best arc of the manga.
02:36:10 Shit, man.
02:36:11 I gotta read this thing.
02:36:12 It's one of the things I've ever seen in a manga series.
02:36:14 I wonder if there's a YouTube video that is about Solider and two people discuss it.
02:36:21 Hippo, take it away.
02:36:25 You didn't like it.
02:36:26 That's cool.
02:36:27 Go watch Chibibacca's on this channel.
02:36:29 Solider, where is it?
02:36:30 Where is it?
02:36:31 The anime Chibibacca's on this channel.
02:36:32 Welcome to Bored, James.
02:36:34 We're the Chibibaccas, and we're James Rolf.
02:36:36 Get ready to play Chibibaccas.
02:36:39 You like Karakano, and that's all that matters.
02:36:43 I can't remember if I've ever said this before, but I watch all of Chibibaccas, and I love
02:36:48 it, particularly because Hippo almost always feels exactly how I would, and describes it
02:36:55 how I would.
02:36:56 Hippo, I think just through sheer force of having mostly known about anime through my
02:37:00 content over the years, is the most satisfying person to listen to talk about anime.
02:37:07 The only experience I have with anime are your videos.
02:37:11 That's literally the only part of anime too.
02:37:13 Yeah, but I feel like Hippo takes my videos, I feel like he agrees with them more, or takes
02:37:20 it to heart.
02:37:22 When I hear him talk about a show, and he's talking about the visuals, and what makes
02:37:26 the visuals good, I'm like, yeah, that's how I have talked about what makes visuals
02:37:30 good in anime.
02:37:31 No one else talks about it that way, because most people are fucking bad.
02:37:36 I guess it's half that, and half the fact that I just like being, like, analysis having
02:37:41 a point in general, so like any analysis video that, like, Mathematosis is really good, but
02:37:48 Joseph Anderson is just sort of slob, and it's okay, because he doesn't really have
02:37:52 a reason for making the videos other than make it for views, and Mathematosis is like
02:37:59 the things coming out of his mouth are things that he needs to express.
02:38:03 He wants to explain these things, and it just, like, I like that approach.
02:38:08 I say it every day, Joseph Anderson is a poor man, is a poor man's Mathematosis.
02:38:12 I mean, Mathematosis is probably one of the best YouTubers of all time.
02:38:17 Period.
02:38:18 I'd put him in my top 20.
02:38:19 And yet I still watch Joseph Anderson, so you know what I'm saying.
02:38:22 Well I hate ChibiBakas, because you guys didn't like Eskrayed, and you were wrong, you were
02:38:27 wrong about that robot.
02:38:28 That was an interesting one.
02:38:29 That was a legendary discussion.
02:38:31 There is not enough, there is a severe lack of long, boring, dry analysis about video
02:38:40 games and shit, like Joseph Anderson and Mathematosis, because those are the best channels, the best
02:38:45 kind of content to watch ever.
02:38:46 Wait, Jesse, do you actually mean that there's a severe lack, because there's a shitload
02:38:51 of it now?
02:38:52 There's not enough.
02:38:53 There is a shitload, but it's not enough, because I've seen all of them, I've watched
02:38:56 all of them.
02:38:57 There's not enough.
02:38:58 You know what it is?
02:38:59 It's still not enough.
02:39:01 Look, I don't know what it is.
02:39:02 There's some ineffable quality that Joseph Anderson and Mathematosis and Mr. B-Tongue
02:39:07 have that like snowball gaming or whatever.
02:39:10 It's just something about a guy who's not trying to be funny, and not trying to impress
02:39:15 me, just kind of talking forever and ever and ever about every little detail in a game.
02:39:20 But the problem is that, like, there's technically a lot.
02:39:27 But they're all, everyone's talking about fallout and oblivion, and that's it.
02:39:31 Those are the only two games everyone talks about.
02:39:34 I want a video like that about every game ever.
02:39:37 Yeah, another fallout game.
02:39:38 Yeah, the new fallout.
02:39:40 The thing is, I watched Angry Joseph, I know what he's going to say.
02:39:43 I feel like a guy like Mathematosis is aware, and is like, everyone's going to say the things
02:39:48 I'm going to talk about, like fucking up his roller and fly.
02:39:49 If you're like me, and you're looking for this shit, and you type into the search bar
02:39:52 on YouTube, like, long boring guy talks about video games, you will just get like an endless
02:39:59 sea of fallout, and oblivion, and Skyrim and shit, and it's like, enough!
02:40:04 There are more games.
02:40:08 Long boring guy sounds like a hippo kid.
02:40:09 Long boring guy is my favorite genre of YouTube.
02:40:12 Jesse, I'm really glad that you clarified that, because I feel the same way you do.
02:40:17 I love super long form, dry analysis, and like, Mathematosis is by far the best.
02:40:23 Nova Caldwell, Gervais, Watchable sometimes, Joseph Anderson just below Watchable for me.
02:40:31 But like, a big part of it is that, yeah, like, every time it's like, seven hour analysis
02:40:36 of fallout, 76, or Mass Effect, Andromeda, or blah blah, and I'm just like, man, can
02:40:41 we like, like, I know you guys are just talking about these games, because you know that like,
02:40:46 a lot of people care, but that doesn't mean that it's a game worth talking for seven
02:40:50 hours about.
02:40:51 You know?
02:40:52 Like, when Matthew Matosis put out his God of War video that was 30 minutes long, I felt
02:40:57 like that was so comprehensive, I was like, how could you possibly have anything to add?
02:41:02 And then Joseph Anderson made the three hour one, and I was like, I'm not watching that,
02:41:06 because I already know, I've already gotten the full experience, I feel like I played
02:41:09 the game after watching Matthew Matosis' video.
02:41:12 That's fair.
02:41:13 You know that one Omega Ruby video or whatever that's like eight hours long?
02:41:16 Yeah.
02:41:17 Oh my god.
02:41:18 Shane May.
02:41:19 Shane May.
02:41:20 I still want to watch that.
02:41:21 It is a good video.
02:41:23 I've watched some of it, but like, I feel like it's just the length which is drawing
02:41:28 people to it.
02:41:29 It didn't need, it probably didn't need to be seven hours.
02:41:33 It could have been trimmed, but I don't think it ever is like, pointless.
02:41:37 I don't think that like, I don't think any of it is like a complete waste of time.
02:41:41 It's so comfy and homey and he's so funny, it's just nice and like you can listen to it in chunks
02:41:49 Like because we listen to it over the course of like almost a week
02:41:51 Like just throwing it on when there was nothing else to do and like at first
02:41:55 I wasn't that interested like at first it kind of felt like a dry analysis video
02:42:00 But like there's so many times that he just like breaks away to tell little stories or joke around or just like and yeah
02:42:06 Somehow it feels unscripted at times like it almost feels like he's like kind of like Ben's poo videos
02:42:12 I would say it's comparable to those. Yeah, in fact, that's exactly what it's like is Ben's poo videos
02:42:17 But but one that lasts seven hours
02:42:21 I mean if you think about it
02:42:23 It's really just that he made a series of videos but put them all into one video and rendered it as a seven hour
02:42:28 Yeah, that's true. You could look at it. I mean the thing is that the guy had come back from like a four-year hiatus
02:42:34 What he did that or something so it's like it wasn't like he just regularly does long-ass videos
02:42:39 He did like a bunch of sonic videos way the fuck back
02:42:42 He did a bunch that are like clearly trying to be sequel it is while also like responding to sequel is and like
02:42:49 I think he used to comment on me back then because I found out about him from him somehow at the time
02:42:55 But then he like disappeared off the map for a long period and then he came back and he did like to
02:43:00 Consecutive like he did like a 30-minute video defending Metroid 2
02:43:04 And then like immediately afterwards a like seven-hour Pokemon Ruby video that he clearly had made them both in the
02:43:11 Yo, I don't know if this is just me or or something
02:43:13 But I type Omega Ruby into you into into Google auto-complete it completes seven hour immediately afterwards
02:43:23 Like he made he's probably needs to relax for a year
02:43:26 I liked I like to believe that he's working on another seven hour review of like a different fucking hard goal
02:43:31 Tell me about my heart golds the greatest game ever
02:43:34 Oh
02:43:37 9.3,000 subs. Yeah, that's a thing. He's not he's not a youtuber
02:43:42 He's just he's just a guy. I was really passionate about Pokemon Omega Ruby, you know like that's that's what I would have thought
02:43:49 He would have had before this video. I know right he would have gotten at least into like the 10k
02:43:53 Some of guys not sure I'm shocked. I'm shocked. I'm shocked to that he is he has on under 10k
02:43:59 No, fuck how many views this is video. This has 280,000
02:44:04 280 so less than I would have expected honestly, but yeah, I thought it would be well, you know
02:44:09 The length of how many of those are that it's not at like yeah most probably
02:44:15 You know this is a fascinating thing to me
02:44:17 I feel like so I listen to a lot of ASMR and what did it like when I'm listening to ASMR it like
02:44:23 It's like I'm embarking in a ship on a sea of like comfiness
02:44:27 And I'm like surrounded by like a comforting presence
02:44:31 I feel like being in the depths of a seven-hour analysis video is like a similar sort of thing
02:44:36 You're just you're floating along in this comfortable world and like I don't know does anyone else
02:44:47 You start to feel like
02:44:50 If you have an insight into his like life in my life, it's like you're you're watching a let's play
02:44:55 Yeah, cuz he doesn't like every detail of the game. He goes like city by city
02:45:00 I mean you could I mean you could beat Omega Ruby in less than seven. I well, maybe I well not easy if you're really
02:45:05 Yeah, another thing I like about it. Sorry, Ben
02:45:08 Another thing I like about it is that he doesn't take anything for granted in this video
02:45:12 Like there's parts where he just explains like the basic conceit of how Pokémon even functions as a game
02:45:20 Like it's not just about Omega Ruby. It's like it's like he's he's he's like hey
02:45:24 I'm telling you about like what's unique about this game
02:45:26 But like let's take a step back and actually just explain how Pokémon even works and functions and why it's even enjoyable
02:45:32 And I love that stuff cuz it's like nobody does that nobody like takes that step back and like explains the mechanics and just like
02:45:39 Why they're fun cuz it's like we've all been playing Pokémon since we were children
02:45:43 But to actually have it spelled out was like, yeah, I guess it is like that, you know
02:45:49 It was cool. Sometimes it do be like that
02:45:52 One thing I think a thing that makes it especially
02:45:54 Comfy listening is like he goes on digressions and he talks about different aspects of the game
02:45:59 But most of them end up kind of being
02:46:02 Tributaries off of this this river that he's on but they all kind of flow back into the same sort of theme like he kind of
02:46:09 He sort of returns to the same I general idea about like what he's saying about the game kind of like like all the things
02:46:16 He talked about kind of lead back into it
02:46:17 So you can kind of like zone out for a while and come back later and like he'll see he's talking about a different aspect
02:46:23 But he's kind of making the same like general sort of
02:46:27 thesis statements with them
02:46:29 So, you know, it's relaxing. You don't have to pay too close attention. Yeah, that's cool. That's cool
02:46:36 The guy's Scottish. Oh, that's right. He's
02:46:38 Oh
02:46:41 Watch cuz he's got such a yeah, that's why I like my well, it's not the only reason why I like it's a nice thing
02:46:46 It's just not him atosis is I read. Yeah, but he's not Scottish
02:46:50 Yeah, when I heard he's like really Irish. Yeah, when I heard about the seven-hour analysis of Pokemon
02:46:55 I had no interest because I thought it would be some boring dry shit
02:46:58 And then as soon as I heard his voice and heard the accent I was like I can watch that
02:47:03 It is a plus. She is really
02:47:09 Colloquialism, so there's a few parts where he just becomes unintelligible on purpose
02:47:14 Yeah
02:47:16 I'll have my I'll have my mate Sheamus to boot you with a claw hammer
02:47:22 All right, all right, we've been talking for a million fucking years
02:47:26 I feel like we should go to the best PCP episode because I didn't get mad at anyone
02:47:30 No point did I think wow, I fucking sure hate you. I'm fucking mad that did you doesn't like the organization 13?
02:47:40 Happened to something they tap into something inevitable
02:47:42 I'll tell you right now iconic for a reason. I've always hated them
02:47:46 However, I will say that there is a high likelihood. This has a lot to do with just like
02:47:51 trauma and
02:47:53 general
02:47:54 this day for people cuz like all the goth kids
02:47:57 I knew in high school who I couldn't stand we're all like
02:48:03 Someone who would wear one and then commit a school shooting
02:48:10 Organization 13 coats and wear it brony con because did you won't be there to uh?
02:48:15 To give us shit for it
02:48:24 No, we didn't all right
02:48:27 But by the way about brony kind should mention that for the past four hours before recording this
02:48:34 I've been sample and I created the the architect
02:48:37 Recurring the blueprints of a road trip a fucking 18-day road trip
02:48:42 I'm gonna go on and any of it will be brony con. All right
02:48:45 Well, they're they're paying for our admission and stuff, right?
02:48:49 No, no, we haven't gotten anything back been is that no we haven't come down yet. Oh, okay. Well, all right
02:48:57 It's
02:49:01 Okay, I at least expected them to say like if they didn't want to do it
02:49:05 They would be like hey, no, we aren't gonna
02:49:10 Like they haven't said anything which almost makes me like it's such like an unbelievable
02:49:15 You that they wouldn't have at least said something that I almost believe that they didn't get it somehow. Yeah, maybe yeah
02:49:21 I think maybe they just missed it or something
02:49:24 I don't know try them again. There's no way because there's no way
02:49:28 All right, but well anyway. All right, let's let's let's see the voice. Yeah. All right. Here we go people
02:49:33 Let's unless anyone's got any blast shit. No, no one's even allowed
02:49:41 All right fucking speak pipe, you know the link just down below send us your own boy
02:49:46 How many we got I have eight there is eight today. So less than less than you
02:49:51 Merciful, okay, first one is from to go a message from to go link
02:49:57 What's I don't like that guy it's got to be a scam
02:50:02 Hey guys, sorry, I haven't made a voicemail in a while
02:50:05 I just wanted to talk about the whole college thing and why my god
02:50:09 No, interrupt this program to bring you a special message from our sponsors
02:50:14 Dix are so cute. Oh
02:50:16 When you hold one in your hand, then it starts twitching like a
02:50:47 Ah
02:50:52 This voicemail is sponsored by
02:50:59 Can we can we get to the ink as the next guess
02:51:03 Let's get it. I really love I really really love
02:51:09 Distortion dope. Yeah
02:51:11 The way to get your voicemail heard on the PCB is just to have a voice
02:51:15 That's like the only requirement
02:51:18 Every single person that downloads a voice modulator just gets in automatic. We actually vet these
02:51:25 Yeah, yeah, I cut a bunch of bullshit and you know what speaking of what do we do?
02:51:30 We we get probably like 20 every week to go through that's something like that a lot
02:51:35 Yeah, it's a lot and I appreciate it and people just so you know
02:51:38 I hear what you're submitting if it's not on it wasn't good enough so work on it
02:51:43 That's a fact. Do you get a lot of repeats? Do you get repeats?
02:51:46 You know, I've actually I think today was the only time I ever got clearly someone like retrying like a bad
02:51:52 Something that they didn't want to do. It's pretty rare honestly
02:51:55 Hmm cuz like they don't get a chance to like nothing back
02:51:58 They have to like commit or I don't know what whatever. Oh, by the way
02:52:01 I was gonna do the next one from the sky Filipino who's doing like a Filipino lesson the audio quality is too shit
02:52:07 So I think I'm gonna skip it. So work on that buddy and try again next time
02:52:12 Okay, but here we go fucking play next one. This is from Peter computer Peter
02:52:19 computer go
02:52:21 Hello members of the PCP
02:52:23 My name is Peter the computer and I love your show more than I love interpreting binary data
02:52:29 But I'm beginning to wonder if you're all just a figment of my imagination
02:52:34 Endless just representing my deep anger and loathing
02:52:37 Munchie my inner child as well as my sense of responsibility
02:52:41 Digi my true nature of pure and honest degeneracy
02:52:44 Along with me best man and Ben sainte representing my split political views and negative feelings
02:52:54 And whatever mage might indicate I don't want to think about it
02:52:58 so thoughts
02:53:00 Do you guys have any proof you actually exist? That's hot. No, literally none
02:53:06 Oh
02:53:08 Robot voice and murder of the universe by King gives it in the lizard wizard. Oh, yeah
02:53:17 Listen, I can I I exist I exist in your heart and you know, you know, that's you know
02:53:23 You can feel my heart teaches us that it literally doesn't matter if you're real or not
02:53:28 You have a heart no matter what and we also have a heart as long as long as you literally believe
02:53:34 That's what matters. So I'm going
02:53:38 This is the son of the computer from the Rayman one review on
02:53:45 If you believe well, hang on if you believe if you believe that you have a heart then you know as Descartes
02:53:51 Descartes cogito ergo some says, you know, I think there I think that something course you must therefore it is true
02:53:58 I thought no
02:54:00 Like a quote about like Descartes talking about Kingdom Hearts
02:54:04 No, like, you know, if you if you if you think that you're real
02:54:14 Listen listen, I had to listen. I gotta do something with my fucking philosophy
02:54:22 Asking if he's real he's asking if we are real which we can't prove to oh
02:54:27 Yeah, but I was you said you got it. It's goddamn voicemail. Yeah, next one. Here we go
02:54:33 Kingdom day card. Yeah, this is from
02:54:36 Harlock as Nibble is calling in with a message. Let's go. Yes
02:54:42 listen
02:54:44 This is Harlock as Nibble
02:54:46 I just want to let you all know that you were all wrong and I was wrong
02:54:51 Not only is there a God
02:54:53 But he's the greatest God. He might be the best God ever and
02:54:58 He hates and and podcasts that have people on it
02:55:04 He also hates YouTube and he definitely hates the liberal politics
02:55:14 His cult as one might call it that he operates in the RFC K
02:55:21 So as I am now a true blue Christian boy once again
02:55:28 Drinking that good red blood and
02:55:31 Voting that good red party. I can no longer associate with the pure degeneracy
02:55:37 PCP podcast this certainly isn't no
02:55:41 Something I have to do only for my parents
02:55:44 I'm not I'm not doing this. So they won't kick me out of the house. This is actually how I feel I
02:55:49 Would never lie at you because that is one of the many sins
02:55:54 It might be one of the seven sinister ones
02:55:57 Or maybe it's not we got it, but it doesn't matter
02:56:01 Please all accept the Lord into your heart
02:56:05 Goodbye
02:56:07 Okay, I got good news for you
02:56:09 Yeah, all I ever wanted with RFC K was for it to become a leftist cult. So I think I I think I did my job
02:56:16 You guys know, you know the cop killers over there in their dark dank
02:56:21 Cathedral just full of darkness and shadows practicing their their liberal politics
02:56:26 They're far left at bullshit the cop killers are just cut way too fucking hard and they need to stop skint
02:56:33 rewatching 90s cartoons scanning for pro for
02:56:37 Progressive progressive gay gay presentation representation every day. That's just what we do over there
02:56:44 There's good news though for this individual. It's that luckily while, you know
02:56:49 The the the alt left Ben sainte may be deterring you from entrance to the procrastiners podcast

02:57:25 Letter of recommendation for my college application
02:57:28 I did in order for me for the college to accept that I had to register you as a
02:57:33 Recommender and when I do that they had they asked you, you know, like was this person's relation to you, right?
02:57:38 And there are stuff like, you know teacher counselor political alignment lawyer
02:57:42 There's an employer which I wouldn't with ultimately, but there also was mentor which which I which I thought of
02:57:49 You went past mentor to a lawyer
02:57:52 saving that one for me, so
02:57:54 Yeah, they're enough. Okay next call. We got one. This is from a little well-known character to all of us named
02:58:02 Sunstone is actually fucking good and great. So let's see
02:58:06 Yeah
02:58:10 No Steven Universe
02:58:14 Okay, it had a glitch the new character. Yeah from fucking she's the cool
02:58:21 Listen here, I am legitimately angry that you guys don't hashtag love and appreciate Sunstone
02:58:28 Sunstone is not only
02:58:30 Sick design Ben is right the first time ever
02:58:34 Just something is a sick design the hair is just incredible. That's point two point two is the hair is also really good and
02:58:41 Hashtag tears flowing from my face as I'm being addressed directly by this cartoon character
02:58:48 Telling me the woes and evils of bullying. I'm frankly appalled and I'm hashtag unsubscribing
02:58:56 From a podcast who hates literal joy and fantastic things such as Sunstone, you know what good bye
02:59:03 All right, crazy. Yeah, it's crazy. I I didn't watch the episode
02:59:08 I just looked it up and saw a picture and was like wow
02:59:12 Because so it's on something is that it looks cool. Yeah, remember you should talk to a while on the Steven Universe
02:59:18 What the fuck is Steven Universe?
02:59:22 You know looking back on it. I just I've just been like annoyed
02:59:28 Mostly because like people are pointing out all over all over the place in the comments of all sorts of things
02:59:34 I've been seeing it everywhere like don't the PCP know that it's a throwback to 90s cartoons
02:59:40 Yes, we know but it was fucking gay in the episode. We know it was bad and it wasn't done
02:59:45 Well, it was a badly told joke. It was rushed and I didn't get it. It's not that I didn't get it
02:59:50 I got it. It was stupid and you're all stupid for liking it. I'm sick of being nice
02:59:55 I'm sick of being mr. Nice guy and diplomatic about these things. I'm right and everyone's wrong. It was bad
03:00:03 Zen. Did you see that? Did you see that? Did you see the Sunstone episode? I I saw the special
03:00:08 What would you what do you what's your take on Sunstone?
03:00:12 On Sunstone, um, I actually like rainbow quartz 2.0 the best. Oh, yeah
03:00:17 I don't even know what that is deep into a series
03:00:21 You probably are of the opinion like you know like no matter how bad it gets I gotta finish it, right?
03:00:26 Like you know like go back to Kingdom Hearts like you played the first ones and they were good
03:00:30 And then you're like, well, I gotta just fucking finish it got again
03:00:33 It's just an obligation. Yep, but Steven Universe weirdly is like I love season one with all my heart
03:00:39 I think it's a perfect show that resonates with me specifically very much so but like it's just gotten bad to the point
03:00:45 Where like I just don't want to watch it
03:00:48 Do you want to preserve do you want to preserve the memory of like that pristine memory of what it's just that I don't care because I
03:00:54 Know that it won't make me happy. I agree. I mean as the series has gone on as it's gotten into the later seasons
03:01:01 I mean, I agree. It was a perfect show with like no filler
03:01:04 But as it's gone on there's just been more and more episodes constantly that I just do do not give a fuck about anything and
03:01:10 Just roll my eyes and it just
03:01:12 Fuck it. It's bad. The whole show is bad
03:01:15 That that one Steven bomb about Steven and Connie breaking up. That was so bad
03:01:22 differently
03:01:22 So I feel weirdly like I like the show even as it is now more than you guys and that really surprises me because I really like it
03:01:29 I I still like the show, but like I was looking through the list of episodes
03:01:33 It's just because it's been so like the upload schedule is so weird and like I
03:01:40 Remember like clumps because that's how they were released. Yeah, but like looking at the episode list
03:01:45 I'm like, okay season one good good good good good all of it's good season two pretty good
03:01:50 You know it starts off great this that season two is like a peridot is around and we're trying to find out and Lapis is also here and
03:01:58 Stuff. Oh, no, she's not here. She's underwater
03:02:01 season three
03:02:03 They start to get a few like who cares episodes sure season four
03:02:08 Who cares episodes season five is like entirely who gives a flying fuck right up until the end where there's like a Steven bomb of like homework
03:02:17 Yeah, I mean I suppose so like season five felt like awful
03:02:20 Maybe I just don't remember because of how much how much of it was like. Oh another onion episode. I really
03:02:27 This is like a weird feeling that I am probably not articulating the best I possibly can
03:02:33 But to me Steven Universe doesn't even like feel real
03:02:37 Like I look at clips of it
03:02:39 I'm like, there's no way that's like actually happening like Steven Mears feels like Mars being like
03:02:45 Was a weird space captain guy or something and this is like fan-made content
03:02:49 This is like there's no way like the story is actually progressed in this way
03:02:53 And then I'll watch like a new episode. I don't just think like this is just
03:02:58 So far removed from what I wanted the show to be like or what to happen
03:03:03 Like it's so completely different from what I expected or what I wanted. It like isn't even faze me
03:03:09 It does not even phase me like I can't like yeah, what did you want?
03:03:12 You just hit white male piece of shit. What did you want the show to be?
03:03:18 It's it's hard to explain. Yeah, I just I
03:03:23 We can have a whole I mean I
03:03:25 I'm well known for hating the gaze and hating the trans and hating everyone
03:03:31 You know, I'm singing my theme song every day hide it lie did lie did Lee get me a rope and find me a tree
03:03:37 But nonetheless, I I'm still enjoying
03:03:42 This I was never a lore fag
03:03:46 I was never like I want them to explore home world and more depth, but even yeah, yeah
03:03:52 I don't like you know, I did I did want all those things, but in hindsight. I think I was wrong
03:03:58 I cared about Steven as a character. I care about the gyms as characters. Yeah, like they have been besmirched
03:04:05 Yeah, I mean it really felt like in the beginning they they definitely fell to the wayside in the in the face of like
03:04:10 Oh, no, the world's gonna explode. Oh, no
03:04:13 Straight up. I fucking everyone who will try to get the seniors will say Steven's annoying
03:04:18 I've loved Steven from episode one and I thought that his arcs were incredible and I love them so much
03:04:25 Steven like was literally me and I love him growing like a mature
03:04:30 Responsible person who's level-headed and he loves people because he's like a boy and he's fatty like likes people and it makes me happy
03:04:37 It makes me really happy, but it's now
03:04:41 About weird bizarre fucking
03:04:45 In the beginning they really season first episode the Steven weight loss arc
03:04:50 Begins
03:04:52 He has to love himself he has to be body positive forever. He has to get fatter fatter forever
03:05:00 Do you remember that episode where he turned into cats and he's yeah, that was a freakish and nightmarish, but also really good
03:05:06 That was a you know
03:05:08 I've been tossing around my head for a while because the way I feel about Steven universe is the same way I used to feel about
03:05:13 Homestuck we're like I know that I don't like it and like it's it's just in the tip of my tongue
03:05:17 But I can't fully express it and I feel like it's been too long since I watched it
03:05:21 Like when it started everything was like
03:05:24 Clarified homesick for me so much. I did the same thing with Steven universe to people to Steven universe soon good idea
03:05:30 There was a lot of mystery at first or was like oh man
03:05:32 I can't wait to see what the other gems are like and what home world is like and what everything's like and now we have those answers
03:05:37 And it's like oh, it's all gay bullshit
03:05:40 Yes
03:05:47 Right now sure sure
03:05:50 Wait a second. I said I'm feeling very vindicated about not having kept up with Steven universe. It's like season 2 episode 6. I
03:05:58 Mean yeah, you're not
03:06:00 The show dropped the ball
03:06:03 I mean that's true. I very much felt like like Steven universe the creators
03:06:07 They weren't like in the right place to make like a globe like universe spanning
03:06:13 I still thought all of you guys
03:06:15 Just assumed all of you guys still loved this show since you were all still watching it. I mean I still
03:06:21 Well, I watch it. I
03:06:24 Like it is just watch it for the same reason. I still read okay
03:06:28 Like just despite season 5 generally being a lot of filler the bits that aren't filler. I'd still do like I did like
03:06:36 Liking and loving like back
03:06:39 Podcasts years ago, we were like oh, this is like
03:06:44 And now you guys are all like I'm like wow like people were giving me so much shit over the years for not keeping up with the show
03:06:52 Did I hear that cryptic tom trying to break the ghostly whale?
03:06:55 I
03:07:03 Steven universe as it stands right now is very similar to kind of how I felt about MLP a lot
03:07:08 Yeah, where that it's it's it's biggest strengths was was its abilities to
03:07:12 Yeah, to have really cool characters and stuff because like this the scope of like the network
03:07:18 It was on and like this the length of the show and stuff
03:07:20 It really lent itself to like quick little character-centric episodes, but now they're increasing the scope
03:07:26 They're going kind of outside their wheelhouse, and it doesn't it doesn't can't support that the the um, yeah
03:07:32 That's true. That's true. You know with them with MLP
03:07:35 Everyone said that like you know this the finales and stuff and like the adventure episodes are the worst ones and the ones
03:07:40 everyone liked were like the character ones like art of the dress and whatever and
03:07:44 Now Steven Steven universe is now about like its overarching story is about the like adventure epic
03:07:51 Indeed, which has never been even though it has the same strength, which was its its character
03:07:58 It's about the right blend with Steven universe, but but yeah still I get the point
03:08:02 Yeah, it's not all bad like I was interested like the whole the whole lap is I like was dope as hell
03:08:06 And I think everybody loved that but the truth
03:08:08 I mean sad you know sad to say I liked the I liked the diamonds a lot more before yeah
03:08:13 Yeah
03:08:14 Meh, what can you do on the other hand?
03:08:16 Adventure time was perfect all the way to the end and everyone who says otherwise is a coward and a phony and a fraud and a jerk
03:08:23 But it didn't push my precious gay agenda enough although it did a little bit
03:08:31 Every character to get double
03:08:35 People who are like oh I stopped watching when it became more about the plot and the lore like what is wrong with you cowards
03:08:41 The show was perfect all the way to the end
03:08:44 Adventure time is actually is actually gays Steven. You're I still it's like fake games gems are not fucking human
03:08:51 They don't fuck they don't it doesn't
03:08:54 Fuck a vampire girl. They don't there aren't even any men for them like okay
03:08:58 Well, so like it was big deal. Don't you dare say
03:09:02 Tell me that pearl doesn't fuck. I refuse to believe it. I have to have hope princess bubble gum and and Marceline
03:09:09 They they cut Finn and chose each other and that's dedication. They gave they gave they actually gave up the dick
03:09:15 They they made a choice. That's true. It mean it now they didn't give it up
03:09:19 They're both grooming him in tandem when he fucking grows that big beard in the future. They're gonna be all over
03:09:27 Okay, hang on maybe I hope I mean I hope so hey
03:09:32 Yeah, we got we got three more people we got three more. Let's let's continue shall we?
03:09:38 Here we go, boom
03:09:43 Wait, is it not playing? I can't hey PCP this this is Steven universe fan
03:09:51 This is a question for Jesse
03:09:53 Since he seems to be the poop the poop man
03:09:58 How do you think pearl poops?
03:10:01 Thank you, it's like a shiny
03:10:11 An answer quickly would be nice. I really need it for my
03:10:18 First of all, I hate you and second of all, I didn't hear the question because everyone is laughing too hard
03:10:24 Even say how does Pearl shit? How does she shit?
03:10:27 What's her shits like are they little pearly shits are they big stinking logs?
03:10:32 That's what he said. Oh, no
03:10:33 I mean, she's obvious she she makes reference to the fact that she hates digesting and hates eating
03:10:37 So obviously her shits in the past have been very slimy very hard to wipe. They never wipe all the way
03:10:42 They take forever. She's on the toilet for hours. Just like why is there so much shit? Why do they never wipe?
03:10:48 She's got that she's got that problem. She's got a never white problem here. She's too much poop. It's too slimy
03:10:53 It's too fucking filthy. She's always got filthy rancid, you know
03:10:56 The few times that she has put herself through the the the traumatic experience of eating and digesting food
03:11:02 It's been a bad experience every time so that's why so there you go. Her poops are bad
03:11:09 Poops are shit on average I as short as possible because it's bad
03:11:19 I spend a lot of time in the toilet just because it's the only place
03:11:22 Where I feel safe where no one is gonna fucking bother me
03:11:25 Honestly, I'm at that age. Sure. That's understandable. I don't push too much, but I take my time
03:11:31 I want me out in in under five minutes. That's a success. That is during a shit
03:11:36 I always do the sitting on the on the seat thing to to maximize a speed
03:11:43 Oh like putting your you know aerodynamic
03:11:46 Yeah
03:11:49 Squad over the fucking toilet it makes it come out squad over the sink
03:11:53 Until I do that, but uh when I was younger it used to always take me like 30 minutes to shit
03:11:59 Like once a day or so and like yeah, I've known a lot of people who take long shits
03:12:04 It's both something that you get better at as you age
03:12:08 Like for some reason you can shit faster as you age
03:12:11 Also, like apparently having like difficulty shitting and taking too long to shit is a sign of autism
03:12:18 So
03:12:22 It's a sign of
03:12:26 It's true, I don't know
03:12:30 Every speed up put your feet up put your feet up on every story that did you tell me you might be surprised
03:12:35 All has the same punch line and then later in life. I find out it's a sign of autism
03:12:40 It's true. Every story
03:12:43 What happens when you so it happens when you grow up obviously autistic and nobody notices until you notice later
03:12:50 Because you read all the stuff about it and you go oh all of this was true about me
03:12:55 But yeah, no, I did read that
03:12:58 I don't I don't remember if it was actually autism or something something like that
03:13:03 But yeah, I've had friends who would spend like literally up to two hours like with a laptop like what my my
03:13:10 cousin boyd used to fucking watch full movies in my fucking toilet and just
03:13:15 Damning up the bathroom for a fucking hour. So I have to go downstairs
03:13:18 I have my own bathroom because I have dain to share it my room with my cousin
03:13:24 He's taking two hours shit. It was really annoying, but then he started like actively trying to cut his shit time
03:13:30 Work because he would have the shit all the time and everywhere like he would take long ass shits like twice a day
03:13:35 Like these fucking chapters
03:13:37 I mean, you know, there's something to be said like I'm sure you guys have like had your phone out
03:13:42 You go to the toilet and then you just like get busy doing stuff while you're shitting and you're like
03:13:47 Like I used to I do I used to consistently read manga while I was shitting and yes
03:13:51 Like if it takes me like if I'm reading the first chapter of a new book and it's like 60 pages long
03:13:56 I might be in there for like 20 minutes, but
03:13:59 These days. I don't even read on the shit
03:14:01 I just try to get in and out as fast as possible because I just don't want to be there all day
03:14:05 Yeah, it's especially cuz fucking cold. I mean if you take it if it's if it's taking you two hours shit
03:14:10 I mean, I think the obvious solution is get in there shit what you can quick finish leave come back two hours later
03:14:18 And deal with the rest. There is nothing more unsatisfying than feeling I have not completely
03:14:25 Dude, I will hold it in until I until I feel that I cannot do it all in one go
03:14:30 Fair enough I guess but I do that in the morning character. I will literally wait
03:14:38 Because I started having stomach problems recently and like I could never shit when I first woke up
03:14:44 But if I wait a few hours until you've like, you know walked around and like yeah, all right
03:14:49 Maybe had comes out way easier and also like something
03:14:52 I'll do is just while taking your shit like get up and like pace around the bathroom to hope like jostle some of it loose
03:14:59 You know sure
03:15:07 Gracie grimy bloody fucking muddy shit poopy shitty fucking bung holes
03:15:13 Spraying out fecal matter all over the fucking walls fucking shitty all over people's fucking face
03:15:19 Smelly poopy bloody shits and someone's mouth. I don't even fucking give a shit fucking kill me someone end my life

03:18:06 Well, I just wanted to remind you that you're gonna be on this the superior pizza party of podcast
03:18:15 Oh

03:18:20 What would you say that the chances are that this gag flop because of input like um, you know, I wouldn't be surprised
03:18:26 That's the issue with you know talking to people online. You sometimes like end up talking over each other and like becomes a whole Lord deal
03:18:44 I
03:18:50 Don't know the audience will appreciate the fact that Xen was actually responding to himself in that call
03:18:57 Yeah, I don't know
03:19:02 That is
03:19:08 It'll uh people will know because the audio quality will be
03:19:12 Impossible it was hard to tell the difference
03:19:16 Over the call. Yeah, I couldn't I couldn't I mean I knew what you were doing because I could see your little right
03:19:22 That was submitted by the way like 10 minutes before the start of the podcast
03:19:29 I thought you know, I thought maybe you had like submitted that like while we were in the call
03:19:34 Because we've gone on for like three and a half
03:19:37 I mean, he certainly would not have made the pizza party podcast if that was
03:19:42 If that is a legitimate hey tell those hey tell those pizza party fucks we got a bone
03:19:48 Deliver
03:19:52 Okay, no, I've literally never listened to it. Damn it. Yeah. Well, I
03:19:59 Like we actually should do that let's start shit with the pizza party. Oh my fucking god. No
03:20:04 No, guys really let's actually fire bomb their house
03:20:07 Let's actually kidnap their children in a no hold a ransom in an abs in an abstract sort of intellectual way
03:20:13 I think it would be really funny if we had beef
03:20:16 That mean Ben please break down the abstract
03:20:20 Intellectual hate that you have to say that how the idea of us having it is great
03:20:25 But the actual practice of doing it sounds like work and a pain and it would be bad
03:20:30 Yeah, that's that's what I mean. Yeah, I just like allocate like ten minutes each. I'm so just I don't know anything about them
03:20:36 I've never watched
03:20:43 We said we were gonna add jingles jingles proceeding segments
03:20:48 We should have a shitting on the pizza party
03:20:51 Someone write a song someone write a song and submit it and we'll play it on the thing and it'll be a jingle about
03:20:57 It's time to start talking about how shit the pizza party pie

03:21:05 That's true. I have I have no integrity. I will
03:21:11 I will tell
03:21:13 I don't even know who's fucking on it and I'm gonna start
03:21:20 They're all gay some
03:21:22 Pushing their alt-right and then simultaneously SJW agenda
03:21:28 Alt-right SJW fucks on the pizza party podcast

03:21:52 There's just this is one little thing we got to do
03:21:54 There's just one little thing we got to talk about before we wrap up this episode. Um, I am that thing
03:22:00 We are announcing the PCP editor contest to find a long-term
03:22:06 Permanent editor for the PCP
03:22:09 Contest starts today link in the description
03:22:13 Look down there
03:22:14 There's a link there to a document that contains all the instructions you need to know about one what we're looking for as the actual
03:22:21 Editor of the PCP and to what you need to do to be entered in the contest
03:22:27 I'm gonna break it down for you real short. We have provided for you
03:22:30 I think it's like five audio tracks that we would normally use to make a PCP episode
03:22:34 It's like 15 minutes long you take those you edit them together with the audio and visual assets
03:22:40 You don't have to use the visual they don't have to stick to our style do whatever you want visually to make that into an example
03:22:45 PCP episode send that to us on Twitter using the hashtag PCP editor contest
03:22:52 It's all in the document. Make sure you send a video file an mp3
03:22:57 fucking
03:22:58 Thumbnail image for the video on YouTube and a text file with the description title tags
03:23:05 Etc. It's a show notes for that episode. It's all in the document also tell us how long it took you to do it
03:23:12 Also, what tell us how long it took you to do it. Oh
03:23:15 Yeah, that's important cuz cuz read the document people. I put all the details in there
03:23:19 You need to know a rather rather we will be judging based on like if because yeah
03:23:25 It's cuz you the main thing that you haven't mentioned is that this is a permanent paid position as editor of the PCP
03:23:32 This is not just like you can edit
03:23:35 That's what I'm doing with this episode
03:23:38 indeed indeed
03:23:40 Well, but that's how it's gonna be people
03:23:43 It's like it's like if you're doing like you need to you know
03:23:45 Submit something that you think you could do for an entire podcast like every wreck like don't you know don't spend like two weeks
03:23:53 Editing this like ten minute mini episode or whatever and get it back to us like yeah, and then you can't you can't do
03:24:02 Yeah, if you want to provide I mean we will be scrutinizing to be like okay
03:24:06 This guy did a full fucking animation that's way too much that probably means he's not the man for the job
03:24:11 So do not go overboard. We're looking for a podcast format. The emphasis is on audio editing
03:24:17 This is an audio show so like hey
03:24:19 I mean it's all in the document, but if you want to fucking scroll down to the part that's like checking your fucking levels
03:24:25 Checking your levels like we you know Tom me and Gib and Ben
03:24:29 Alden our own little like visual syncing with the audio things look if you want to do that great
03:24:34 We're happy to have it, but do not overburden yourself and make it a big deal
03:24:39 It's supposed to be a small thing make it slightly more pleasing the emphasis is on the audio
03:24:43 So keep that in mind people yeah that in mind
03:24:46 But that said we're gonna pick the best one whoever makes the best stuff that's sustainable wants to get paid
03:24:51 It wants to be a part of the fucking team
03:24:53 And that's it. That's really everything you need to know I think so it's in the description click that document
03:24:58 It's got everything you need to know if you got questions
03:25:01 We probably should also like clarify using the same hashtag PCP editor contest
03:25:07 I think we might need to be like ages 16 and up or something for labor law purposes because we
03:25:14 That you have to be legal to work. I don't know what age I assume it's like 18 plus or something
03:25:22 Might might depend on what might depend on what country yeah, it could depend on that
03:25:26 So I guess that's up to you folks if you're 16, and you don't know do us a favor and Google it
03:25:31 If you're legal to fucking work and do this shit
03:25:34 Yeah, I mean, I don't know or over 18 then it should be fine
03:25:37 I think or I mean just fake your information really convincingly because then it's not our oh, that's fair. I would think
03:25:48 Get excited people this is your chance to be a member of the your favorite podcast
03:25:53 Remember
03:25:56 Well, that's what I mean I'm on the team
03:25:59 I'm but I'm excited but I'm excited to see like I don't know
03:26:02 Maybe someone will come up with like a really neat visual look and I'll be really cool
03:26:05 And it'll be like hey, I really want this. I don't know. I'm excited to see what right make me and again just to clarify that remember
03:26:12 This is a paid slave indentured servant position
03:26:15 You are not a member of the PCP by winning this you are a lowly if you employ you rag them up and fuck
03:26:22 If we start to get the impression you're trying to bury Kramer your way on to the show we're gonna cut you right out
03:26:27 So don't even try so have no
03:26:31 You will be a friend or respected by us in any capacity
03:26:37 That's that's what you need to know people
03:26:40 Don't waste our fucking time if your shit just skip it only do it and and also you will be laid off at a moment's notice
03:26:47 If any of us need extra money for editing at any point
03:26:51 Indeed indeed, of course, of course
03:26:54 We'll try to have general job security here, but like you know, maybe one day someone's gonna want to be like
03:27:00 Hey, I want to do a Delta room thing. That's really cool
03:27:02 We're gonna try to do this rarely to take it away and do the editing
03:27:05 We want this to be you this you I'm talking to you future winner of this contest
03:27:10 What are we paying to be you week to week doing this shit?
03:27:13 We are it's in the document everything you need to know and by the way part of the test here is reading the document
03:27:20 Understanding it because that shows professionalism that shows your ability
03:27:24 Don't give them all the hints
03:27:28 That's that's too much already you've got everything you need to do this like the hunt. I have just received word
03:27:33 I have missed the people that this episode when I don't fucking longer. I miss the puppy bull
03:27:41 It happens before the fucking Super Bowl every year what it's it's the only good thing about the Super Bowl wait
03:27:49 Today Patriots are in the go fucking game versus the ramp. That's really funny that we've gone this whole this whole day
03:27:55 This whole thing we didn't talk about the Super Bowl. I didn't know what's happening
03:27:58 But I did hear but I did hear the recording this before the Super Bowl, so it's like indeed
03:28:10 Because that's a pretty important thing we glossed over my favorite football team
03:28:13 Is the Miami Dolphins and also the Dallas Cowboys and other teams that I know
03:28:43 Don't want to do I just I just think John from needs, you know, he needs to be redeemed
03:29:13 I
