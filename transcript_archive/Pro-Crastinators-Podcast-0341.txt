00:00:00 Hello everyone, it's The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint, this is Gibbontake.
00:00:19 Hello, I'm still a little sick, so I might be coffin.
00:00:22 Nice. We've got a guest today. We've got Deadly Comics, whose animations many of you, I feel like, might have seen around for a pretty long time now. Hi, Deadly.
00:00:34 Whoa, hello. How did I get here?
00:00:37 I don't know.
00:00:38 How did you get into our review?
00:00:41 Everything that happened in the past several weeks is just a complete blank, and I don't know why you're here or who you are. Why don't you explain who you are?
00:00:50 I should have thought this far ahead, at least.
00:00:53 It's okay.
00:00:55 You have a YouTube channel where you do really cute and high production animations with little furries. Little furry people.
00:01:07 And they're great.
00:01:09 I think the earliest stuff of yours I ever saw was some MLP stuff back in the pony days. I think you did a Scootaloo, right? There was one of, like, Scootaloo in her bedroom. Am I?
00:01:19 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:01:20 Yeah, I remember that one from back in the day.
00:01:23 I remember the fucking Gibbontake GIF you did of me jumping up and down.
00:01:28 Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.
00:01:31 Eleazar, put that on screen. Find it.
00:01:34 Find it. I forgot where it is. I'm sure I've saved it somewhere.
00:01:37 Must have it somewhere.
00:01:39 Some DVD or something. I don't know. I really liked your character design. I just had to animate that hair flopping around.
00:01:48 Yeah, yeah.
00:01:49 You know how it is.
00:01:51 I do.
00:01:54 Most recently, I remember, I saw the one that you did where the golf ball goes down the golf hole and the fish is down there and says things.
00:02:08 Right? That was you, right?
00:02:10 Yeah, yeah.
00:02:11 And I also saw, a little before that, I caught, it was the one with Twilight and Mordecai on the road singing that Muppet song.
00:02:23 Right? Yeah.
00:02:24 That one was awesome. By the way, that one got, I mean, I know you didn't write the song, but like, that song, from watching that animation, that song got stuck.
00:02:32 It actually still, I still think about it because I saw that animation and that song is really catchy.
00:02:38 And I'll just say, while I'm gushing about it, I'll say the bit where, the bit where they say Cabot and they hold up the cheese is really funny.
00:02:45 I watched that over and over again.
00:02:47 The little one frame, with the little like one frame moment where Twilight holds up the Cabot cheese.
00:02:54 And then there's like, they just really fast look at the camera like, and then just move on.
00:02:59 That, that, that's not in the original, that's not in the original, that's not a joke the Muppets make.
00:03:06 That was you, so good job.
00:03:10 I'm glad you liked the one original part of the video.
00:03:14 Thanks, yep, the only one.
00:03:17 Uh, there's like, there's a mixed media too, because it was like, it was like a, it was like a real like, like toy set, right?
00:03:25 It was like a physical like car set and they animated the characters in it, right?
00:03:31 Yeah, I got, um, I thought it would be, where did that start?
00:03:36 I thought it would be really funny if Twilight Sparkle had a car, so I looked it up and she did.
00:03:42 It does have a car, a toy car.
00:03:45 So I thought it, Hasbro made one?
00:03:47 Yeah, like a little RC controlled car.
00:03:50 Let's, let me find it, lol.
00:03:53 I don't know, I thought it would be funny if she like had one in the show to promote the toy or something.
00:03:59 They should, they should have made an episode, they should have made like a drag racing episode.
00:04:04 That would have been great.
00:04:07 Um, Gabe, did you see that one? The one I'm talking about?
00:04:11 I, I, I must have, because I'm subscribed, I guess I forgot exactly what it was.
00:04:16 The most recent one with the, with the, uh, the little fish and, uh, I can't remember.
00:04:26 Oh no, I'm so bad.
00:04:28 Oh, deadlycomics.com.
00:04:30 Now websites have dated, I'm sorry.
00:04:33 Uh, two days ago, Grand Tour, that's the one.
00:04:36 I just saw that, that came out.
00:04:38 Oh, there's a new one?
00:04:40 Yeah, it's so.
00:04:41 I haven't seen it.
00:04:42 There's a new one.
00:04:43 Oh, it told me.
00:04:45 It got the little, little furry people.
00:04:49 And they're on like a, a cool like tree house.
00:04:54 And I don't know who these characters are.
00:04:56 I don't know if there's like a continuity that I've been like missing.
00:04:59 What's, uh, what's, what's up?
00:05:01 What's up with all your animations, huh?
00:05:03 What's, what's going on?
00:05:04 Yeah, what's the deal with that?
00:05:05 What's the deal with that?
00:05:06 I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya.
00:05:07 Uh, those cartoons is called cool times.
00:05:11 That's why I'm focusing on to like have a, try to have like more of a
00:05:16 narrative ongoing thing.
00:05:18 Um, so it's like all these characters live together in this like
00:05:23 repurposed lighthouse on a mysterious island.
00:05:26 And they're like all part of some sort of, some sort of company.
00:05:31 But it's unclear exactly what the company does.
00:05:34 It's kind of like, uh, like as a kid pretending to play business,
00:05:40 like pretending to have a company, uh, it's kind of like that.
00:05:46 But what if that happened, but, you know, it was on a bigger scale.
00:05:51 It just like kept going somehow.
00:05:54 Yeah.
00:05:55 That was the kind of loose idea behind having all these characters
00:05:59 together and just doing weird, uh, stupid things.
00:06:02 Uh, yeah.
00:06:03 I'm seeing cool times in vivo those two years ago where she's on the
00:06:07 little piano.
00:06:08 Is this, is this, is this the car?
00:06:11 I'm posting the car.
00:06:13 Ask the car.
00:06:14 Nice.
00:06:15 Very nice.
00:06:17 It's like little voice clips when you press the button.
00:06:21 Holy shit.
00:06:22 Little car noises.
00:06:24 Holy shit.
00:06:26 Yeah, I'm scrolling through now and I see the moon right along.
00:06:31 I'm like, yes, I did watch that.
00:06:34 This is a whole year ago.
00:06:36 Animation takes so long.
00:06:38 That's fucked up.
00:06:39 I was going to do the whole song, but like, by the time I got to a point,
00:06:47 like the meme was already long dead.
00:06:50 Was it, was it like a meme at the time?
00:06:52 Was it when I started it?
00:06:54 It was.
00:06:55 And then.
00:06:56 With Twilight and Mordecai singing two halves of a song.
00:07:01 Yeah.
00:07:02 With Emma's paint.
00:07:03 Like, like somebody drew them singing a song.
00:07:06 Oh, the airplanes and then the airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars.
00:07:09 I think the thing that Elon and Grimes had as their Twitter pfp.
00:07:12 I did.
00:07:13 Yeah.
00:07:14 I think so.
00:07:15 Unless everyone's lying to me.
00:07:20 I look, I don't know.
00:07:22 Look, I don't know anymore.
00:07:23 I don't know.
00:07:24 I mean.
00:07:25 Okay.
00:07:26 Okay.
00:07:27 But okay.
00:07:28 But not that song.
00:07:29 Not specifically that song was not a meme, but the Mordecai and Twilight was a meme.
00:07:33 It sprung from that post though.
00:07:35 Okay.
00:07:36 Okay.
00:07:37 I'd never, I'd never heard that song before because I've never seen.
00:07:39 Is it the great, the great Muppet Capers?
00:07:41 Is that the one it's from?
00:07:43 That's from the Muppet movie.
00:07:44 Like the original is this cover is from like a tribute album kind of thing.
00:07:49 Yeah.
00:07:50 Yeah.
00:07:51 It's, I know it's, I know it's a cover, but it's by like, it's by like My Chemical Romance
00:07:58 or Green Day or something.
00:08:00 Alkaline Trio.
00:08:01 Alkaline Trio.
00:08:02 Which is a band I don't know anything about besides that one song.
00:08:06 Yeah.
00:08:07 Yeah.
00:08:08 Shit.
00:08:09 What was that?
00:08:11 I was going to say something.
00:08:13 Cover for me.
00:08:15 Duh.
00:08:16 Duh.
00:08:17 Duh.
00:08:18 Oh wait.
00:08:19 I get it.
00:08:20 I'm going to see.
00:08:21 I'll see the new one.
00:08:22 You went to uni or college for animation I assume based on, based on a few of your like
00:08:29 short films that are out here.
00:08:31 Right.
00:08:32 Those were like school films.
00:08:33 Yeah.
00:08:34 Yeah.
00:08:35 I went to school of visual arts in New York.
00:08:38 How was that?
00:08:40 And that was a time.
00:08:41 Oh, I never know what to say.
00:08:44 It was a time.
00:08:46 It was a time.
00:08:47 One of the colleges of all time.
00:08:50 Did it, do you think it like hypercharged your animation skills?
00:08:56 I think, I'd say so.
00:08:59 Just like having the structure to have time to make stuff is good.
00:09:06 And having people to show it to and get feedback from.
00:09:10 That's good.
00:09:11 That stuff's good.
00:09:13 Yeah.
00:09:14 I went to animation school and I, I really enjoyed the, the sort of atmosphere of everybody
00:09:23 doing the same specific niche thing.
00:09:26 So there's always like, ah, talking about it, like getting a project together.
00:09:32 Because I always have big projects, big ideas, but in a place like that is actually possible
00:09:38 to make stuff.
00:09:39 And the stuff you made is like really cool.
00:09:42 Like really like avant-garde out there, but also cutesy.
00:09:46 I love your films too.
00:09:48 Spider One is a fave, is absolutely a fave.
00:09:52 Yeah, thanks.
00:09:54 Yeah, I'm looking, I'm looking through.
00:09:56 Okay.
00:09:57 There's actually, I'm realizing, I'm realizing how many of your animations I have not seen
00:10:03 actually as I'm scrolling through this list.
00:10:06 It's not like there's a lot.
00:10:09 So it wouldn't take any time to catch up.
00:10:12 Well, it feels like there's a lot.
00:10:16 I mean, I'm still scrolling.
00:10:18 I remember Rabbit Runner.
00:10:20 I remember when that came out.
00:10:22 Oh yeah.
00:10:23 That was, I think I got like all my weeb shit out into one video.
00:10:29 So I never had to put anime stuff in the cartoon again.
00:10:34 Hey, I see you just released a plush.
00:10:36 I tried to.
00:10:38 It did not reach its funding goal.
00:10:40 Oh, really?
00:10:41 No.
00:10:42 I know the feeling.
00:10:45 Well, I shouldn't have said anything.
00:10:50 I had fun making the video though.
00:10:53 Which one was that?
00:10:54 The Confined Bee?
00:10:56 No, it's What Has Science Done.
00:10:58 Oh yeah.
00:10:59 Oh, that's so sad.
00:11:00 There's such a cute little guy.
00:11:02 Is the campaign over?
00:11:04 Yeah.
00:11:05 So there was like an earlier campaign, which was successful for like a deadly comics plush.
00:11:11 Yeah.
00:11:12 But then the company makeshift decided to like re-do a bunch of plushes, but with like
00:11:19 cyborg parts for Cyber Monday.
00:11:22 Oh.
00:11:23 Which is kind of.
00:11:24 That's why.
00:11:25 Yeah.
00:11:26 It's, I mean, an interesting choice for your character here.
00:11:31 Yeah.
00:11:32 I mean, it doesn't make much sense.
00:11:34 No.
00:11:35 Which is probably why not enough people bought the thing.
00:11:38 It's a bit.
00:11:39 And also like people who bought the plush, you know, they only need to buy another one
00:11:43 just because this has some gold bits on it.
00:11:45 Definitely.
00:11:46 So it's like, nah, I'm not.
00:11:50 Wait, so did the company just tell you like, hey, so we're, we were gonna, you wanted to
00:11:58 make this plush, but like we're here to tell you that like, no, we won't make the one you
00:12:02 wanted to make.
00:12:03 We're making one with gold robot parts on it.
00:12:05 And there's nothing you can do about it.
00:12:07 I'm a little confused.
00:12:08 Oh, well, no, they made the first plush.
00:12:11 There was another plush campaign, which was successful.
00:12:13 Okay.
00:12:14 Okay.
00:12:15 And then they like did this other ones so they could like reuse the, the schematics of
00:12:20 the plush to like do another run of them, but with gold bits.
00:12:27 Good.
00:12:28 Good.
00:12:29 I see.
00:12:30 Can I still buy the plush?
00:12:32 Oh, no.
00:12:33 I don't know if I can.
00:12:36 Like the original.
00:12:37 Oh, no, that's long gone.
00:12:39 Dang it.
00:12:40 It's a cute little character.
00:12:42 I like him.
00:12:43 Hey, I'm glad you think so.
00:12:45 Oh my God, you did a review.
00:12:47 You did a movie review.
00:12:49 Not really.
00:12:50 Deadly comics reviews.
00:12:51 The cat returns.
00:12:52 It's 30 seconds long.
00:12:54 Wait, it gives in it.
00:12:56 What?
00:12:57 What the fuck?
00:12:58 I just hovered over the thumbnail and I saw you from years ago.
00:13:04 The cat returns.
00:13:06 Oh, I am in that.
00:13:08 What the fuck?
00:13:09 I think you commented on it.
00:13:11 That's a six year old video.
00:13:13 Yeah.
00:13:14 It's, I'm just, I'm just watching it.
00:13:16 I'm just watching this review.
00:13:18 We're 10, we're 10 seconds into the 32nd review and the review hasn't started yet.
00:13:24 What the fuck?
00:13:26 I think the video.
00:13:28 20 seconds and I still don't know what you thought of the movie.
00:13:31 I think it's clear from how it's edited when I thought of the movie.
00:13:37 Okay, I think you might have thought of this good shit.
00:13:40 Yeah.
00:13:41 Yeah.
00:13:42 All right.
00:13:43 Well, now I know.
00:13:44 Okay.
00:13:45 Oh, no, and then YouTube recommended me a Night Mind video afterwards.
00:13:53 I hate Night Mind.
00:13:55 What's wrong with Night Mind?
00:13:56 I hate Night Mind.
00:13:57 What's wrong with Night Mind?
00:13:58 I don't like his voice.
00:13:59 I don't like his voice.
00:14:00 No.
00:14:01 His voice is so fake.
00:14:02 It's the, and the competition is stiff.
00:14:05 The competition is stiff, but Night Mind has the fakest voice I've ever heard and it's disgusting.
00:14:10 It's sickening.
00:14:11 It's not.
00:14:12 It makes me want to grow up.
00:14:13 I met him in person and he talks like that in real life.
00:14:15 I don't care.
00:14:16 I don't care.
00:14:17 I don't care.
00:14:18 That doesn't change my opinion at all.
00:14:20 He's still faking it, even if it's not, even if it's real.
00:14:25 Following the classic PlayStation style, there's a company released a stupid video game in 2002.
00:14:32 I love stupid video games.
00:14:34 It made a million dollars, but was the game haunted?
00:14:37 No, but people on a forum said so.
00:14:40 What do you think about that, viewers?
00:14:42 I don't, he doesn't, no.
00:14:44 It's not natural.
00:14:45 It's not natural.
00:14:47 Maybe he talks like that in person, but he's faking it.
00:14:51 Fuck you, Night Mind.
00:14:53 I hate you.
00:14:55 I'm there for the spooky video game, whatever.
00:14:59 Night Mind is just a poor man's Nightmare Masterclass, so there.
00:15:08 Wow.
00:15:09 Yeah.
00:15:10 Vicious.
00:15:11 Yeah.
00:15:14 All right.
00:15:15 You know who else I hate?
00:15:17 Unique Namosaurus.
00:15:18 I hate that guy.
00:15:20 Well, yeah.
00:15:22 Okay.
00:15:23 Well, we don't have to say anything else about that.
00:15:26 We don't need to do the hate.
00:15:28 You know what I hate?
00:15:29 People.
00:15:30 Specific people.
00:15:31 Let me just read you off a list.
00:15:33 Let me just read you off a list of people I'm mad at.
00:15:36 Okay, I won't.
00:15:37 Read your nice people list.
00:15:38 Read a list of good things you recommend in love.
00:15:41 I don't have one of those.
00:15:43 I really should have one of those.
00:15:45 I would recommend Daily Comics.
00:15:47 Whoa.
00:15:48 I'll check him out.
00:15:52 That's a furry shit, though.
00:15:55 Yeah.
00:15:56 It's weird.
00:15:57 It's perverse.
00:15:59 Unnatural.
00:16:01 Definitely.
00:16:02 It's almost as unnatural as Night Mind.
00:16:04 Who is a furry?
00:16:06 Is that true?
00:16:07 Wait, am I thinking of someone else?
00:16:09 No, I'm not.
00:16:10 Well, I wouldn't know.
00:16:14 How's everyone's week been?
00:16:18 Well, good.
00:16:20 What have you been up to?
00:16:23 I wrote down some notes, but I genuinely couldn't think of anything.
00:16:28 Okay.
00:16:29 I have a lot of question marks.
00:16:31 No, I tried to write notes.
00:16:33 Like, what happened since last week?
00:16:35 I'm like, oh, shit.
00:16:37 Well, I finished a commission.
00:16:39 That's it.
00:16:41 Hooray.
00:16:43 Okay.
00:16:44 I guess it's getting sparklier around here.
00:16:47 I did talk about getting the decorations up.
00:16:50 There's still things to put up that sparkly lights around.
00:16:54 It snowed.
00:16:55 I don't know if I talked about that.
00:16:57 It snowed and I made a snow person.
00:17:00 It snowed here too.
00:17:02 Just a little bit.
00:17:03 Is that your first snow of the year?
00:17:05 Yeah.
00:17:06 Don't always get snow during Christmas time.
00:17:09 Sometimes it waits until February and then it snows.
00:17:12 But we got some.
00:17:14 Deadly, where do you live?
00:17:16 Are you American?
00:17:17 Yep, I'm in Brooklyn.
00:17:19 Oh, okay.
00:17:20 Okay.
00:17:21 It's snow here yet.
00:17:22 You're not even far from me.
00:17:24 You're like a two-hour drive from me.
00:17:26 Oh, yeah?
00:17:27 Two or three.
00:17:28 I'm in Boston.
00:17:29 Oh, cool.
00:17:30 Very nice.
00:17:31 Very nice.
00:17:32 Did you get snow recently?
00:17:34 No.
00:17:35 There's snow in Boston, though.
00:17:37 Yeah, a little bit.
00:17:38 Just one night and then it was mostly melted by the next day.
00:17:42 So that was cool, I guess.
00:17:44 Didn't have to shovel.
00:17:46 I had a family.
00:17:48 My family did their Christmas Eve get together early.
00:17:53 We did it yesterday.
00:17:55 That was all right.
00:17:57 That was kind of fun.
00:17:59 A bunch of my cousins have kids now.
00:18:01 So there were a bunch of little kids running around.
00:18:03 And honestly, I appreciated it because it was sort of something to distract everyone.
00:18:10 They didn't have to spend too long talking about what you've been up to, where you live
00:18:14 now, what's your job.
00:18:16 How much closer are you to the grave?
00:18:18 How much closer are you to the grave?
00:18:20 Are you ready to put a down payment on a house yet?
00:18:22 A bunch of my cousins have become landlords, which is like, I don't know what to say about
00:18:28 that.
00:18:29 Yeah.
00:18:30 Like big complex landlords or like a little two-family house landlord?
00:18:38 So whatever.
00:18:39 I'm not going to be like, well, I think you should get the gulag, even though it would
00:18:45 be really funny.
00:18:46 But I don't say that.
00:18:47 I'm just like, hmm, whatever.
00:18:50 It's just funny to hear them be like, yeah, I had a tenant who was a veteran who was running
00:18:56 like an illegal gunsmithing business out of my basement.
00:19:02 And then his girlfriend and him broke up and she rescinded all their like gun licenses.
00:19:07 And so the cops came and kicked my door down.
00:19:11 It's like, yeah, okay.
00:19:13 It's a pretty good story.
00:19:15 I know a guy who's a landlord and he talks about teaching his son to be a landlord because
00:19:21 that's the only way to make money.
00:19:23 What's there to teach?
00:19:25 But it was just interesting because I said, yeah, I'm not going to be a landlord.
00:19:30 But it was just interesting because it's like, yeah, I guess like there's so many people
00:19:35 who like going into the landlording.
00:19:38 Like if I think everybody should be a landlord, but you know, if they're our own building.
00:19:43 Hey, yeah, you know, we've got all these empty houses and all these homeless people.
00:19:49 We should make, they shouldn't be allowed to live in them, but we should make those homeless
00:19:54 people own those houses.
00:19:56 We should give them the houses not to live in, but to rent so they can have an income.
00:19:59 They can rent those houses to other people that can afford to live in them.
00:20:03 What do we think?
00:20:05 Make the homeless into landlords.
00:20:07 This is like one problem with another.
00:20:10 I'll workshop it.
00:20:11 This is like when they brought in the weasels to deal with all the snakes and then they
00:20:18 just had a weasel infestation.
00:20:20 And then they brought in the foxes to deal with the weasels and then they brought the
00:20:24 bears to deal with the foxes.
00:20:26 And then they brought the gorillas to deal with the bears.
00:20:30 And the gorillas reigned supreme.
00:20:34 No.
00:20:35 Then they brought the rhinoceroses.
00:20:38 Yes.
00:20:39 Yes.
00:20:40 And they were bigger.
00:20:42 Then they brought in the blue whales.
00:20:47 Oh, we saw a video of, you know, those like giant, I don't know if it's a whale shark,
00:20:55 but they're that big fish that feed by like they go up to the surface of the water and
00:21:00 they open their mouths and they just like...
00:21:03 Yeah, they slurp up.
00:21:05 Yeah.
00:21:06 I saw a video of like a bunch of like people were just like swimming in like the beach and
00:21:11 like they have like a little like rowboat.
00:21:14 And this fucking like one of those came up and it just started like sucking water up.
00:21:19 Like it might have sucked someone into it.
00:21:21 It looks so fucking scary.
00:21:23 Yeah.
00:21:24 Like it's like...
00:21:25 It started screaming.
00:21:26 It's like, yeah, I would scream.
00:21:28 It looks so like powerful.
00:21:30 It's like the real version of like being scared that the swimming pool filter is going to
00:21:35 suck you up and destroy you.
00:21:37 Although it could actually happen.
00:21:39 Although it wasn't as big as I thought.
00:21:41 Like looking at it, I'm not sure if it actually, if that one actually could have like fully
00:21:46 swallowed a person.
00:21:47 It seemed like it could have.
00:21:49 It was hard to tell.
00:21:50 It's like the size of a couch its mouth.
00:21:52 If not, you get stuck and then drown anyways.
00:21:55 So it's still a little scary.
00:21:57 I wonder if, I wonder if it tried to suck you up because it's not meant to eat something
00:22:02 human size.
00:22:03 I wonder if like a medium sized one, it would just kind of like sort of like cough if it
00:22:08 tried to suck you up.
00:22:09 It would probably spit you out.
00:22:11 Yeah.
00:22:12 Like realistic.
00:22:13 Oh shit.
00:22:14 It's a rock.
00:22:15 I got it.
00:22:16 I can't swallow that.
00:22:17 I hope that's what would happen.
00:22:18 God.
00:22:19 I don't know where the rock is.
00:22:20 Rocks don't float.
00:22:22 Yeah.
00:22:23 Maybe a piece of driftwood.
00:22:24 Maybe, maybe very, very small rock.
00:22:26 Only very small rocks float.
00:22:28 That's a, that's a Monty Python joke.
00:22:30 Okay.
00:22:32 The spongy rock.
00:22:34 One of those, one of those volcanic rocks.
00:22:36 It'd be, it'd be one of those rocks with the funny jellyfish on it from Subnautica that
00:22:42 make the rocks float.
00:22:43 You know that?
00:22:44 I haven't played Subnautica.
00:22:46 Oh my God.
00:22:47 It's, if you are scared of the ocean, it's the perfect way to die.
00:22:50 Yeah.
00:22:51 The perfect way.
00:22:53 Yeah.
00:22:54 I think I would be very scared.
00:22:56 I've seen Subnautica and it's like, I know that like most of the creatures are not that
00:23:01 scary looking, but it's still, I think it would, I feel like it would be scary.
00:23:06 It's the fear of the unknown.
00:23:08 The sound design is like very impressive.
00:23:11 And if you've got like headphones in, you don't know what's going to kill you or what
00:23:15 can kill you, but you'll hear noises and you don't know what they do, what they mean.
00:23:19 And, you know, when the sun goes down, the sea is completely pitch black unless you have
00:23:24 a torch.
00:23:25 So you are, you are very scared all the time.
00:23:28 Something like that.
00:23:29 Until you aren't.
00:23:31 Something looming out of the, out of the depths of the ocean beneath me coming up to like
00:23:37 get me is like, is one of the scariest things that I can think of.
00:23:42 That's why it was very, it was really scary.
00:23:46 Oh, in Outer Wilds with the freaking, the anglerfish coming out of the mists and the
00:23:52 bramble.
00:23:53 That's just scary.
00:23:57 But anyway, why did it, why was I talking about that?
00:24:01 Why did it bring up that fish?
00:24:02 Oh, you brought up the fish.
00:24:03 Yeah, scary fish.
00:24:04 That video.
00:24:05 Scary fish.
00:24:07 That's it.
00:24:08 I was talking to one of my cousins.
00:24:09 One of my cousins did ask me a little bit about, a couple of people asked me how I've
00:24:14 been working on and I mentioned, because you know, I've been talking about finishing that
00:24:18 slime and punishment book for years now and I told them, yeah, I still haven't finished
00:24:22 it.
00:24:23 And some of them told me, some of them asked me what else I've been doing and I mentioned
00:24:28 the video.
00:24:29 Nobody asked me what the video was.
00:24:30 So I didn't have to explain it.
00:24:31 It was an eight hour long video explaining the history of Mega Man.
00:24:34 So that was a relief.
00:24:36 But one cousin did ask me like, how does YouTube work?
00:24:39 How do you make money off that?
00:24:40 And I explained like how ad revenue works.
00:24:43 And then he walked away and I was like, that was a nightmare.
00:24:46 That was the worst conversation I've ever had.
00:24:49 I'm glad nobody else asked me about it.
00:24:54 That's it.
00:24:56 Hell yeah.
00:24:57 Hell yeah.
00:24:59 Glad.
00:25:00 I missed out on a, I don't know if I talked about this last time, but I missed out on a
00:25:05 family get together because I was sick.
00:25:07 Oh.
00:25:09 I mean, I did want to see people, but apparently it was really awkward.
00:25:13 So I'm glad I didn't.
00:25:14 Why was it awkward?
00:25:15 I don't know.
00:25:16 It was just one of those, it was like a, it was grandpa's birthday dinner.
00:25:21 He's 90.
00:25:22 And so they were going to go to a restaurant to get nice food and talk.
00:25:28 But my dad has like an electric car and where they were going didn't really have that many
00:25:35 charging stations.
00:25:37 So it was kind of a nightmare trying to find a charging station so they could charge so
00:25:41 they could come back.
00:25:42 And it was freezing cold and it was snowing and apparently the restaurant food sucked.
00:25:47 And it was just sort of like one of those weird long tables where if you're sitting at
00:25:51 the wrong end, you currently talk to anybody.
00:25:54 So it was like, dang, dodged a bullet, I guess.
00:25:57 I did throw up though.
00:25:59 So, you know, I was not feeling great, but I think I would have felt worse.
00:26:07 If I had gone.
00:26:08 I missed, I missed my, last year I missed Christmas because of, because I got the coronavirus.
00:26:13 So, not this year.
00:26:15 Not this year, unless I got it then and now I'll miss Christmas because of it.
00:26:20 Because some one of my stupid relatives had it.
00:26:23 Lol.
00:26:24 I don't know.
00:26:25 That's all I got to say about that.
00:26:27 That's it.
00:26:28 That's it.
00:26:29 How's your week been, Deadly?
00:26:31 Yeah, Deadly.
00:26:32 What's up?
00:26:33 This whole time I'm trying to think about what the heck happened and I can't remember.
00:26:38 What do you spend your days doing?
00:26:41 What's a typical week look like?
00:26:44 A typical week?
00:26:47 Let's see.
00:26:48 I work from home so I don't ever leave.
00:26:51 I work for a studio doing storyboard revisions.
00:26:55 Oh.
00:26:56 Which is fun.
00:26:57 Which is good and fun.
00:26:59 I didn't know you did that.
00:27:01 Yeah.
00:27:02 I draw little characters, fix little mistakes at acting and stuff.
00:27:07 I don't ever talk to people clearly.
00:27:11 Do you, do you mind if I ask like what studio or what your storyboards are for?
00:27:17 Yeah, sure.
00:27:18 It's a studio called Titmouse in New York.
00:27:21 Titmouse?
00:27:22 It's like, Titmouse.
00:27:24 Is it, is it family friendly?
00:27:28 Some of it.
00:27:31 It's a bird.
00:27:32 It's a bird.
00:27:33 The Titmouse bird.
00:27:34 You don't know about the bird?
00:27:35 I've heard of it.
00:27:36 I've heard rumors.
00:27:37 It's a real thing.
00:27:39 Is it like Motor City?
00:27:41 They did, what else did they do?
00:27:45 Big mouth.
00:27:46 Yeah, they did big mouth.
00:27:48 Did you, did you work on big mouth?
00:27:50 I did not.
00:27:51 Good.
00:27:52 I don't like it.
00:27:54 Star Trek Lower Decks.
00:27:57 I've heard of Motor City.
00:28:00 Well, there's a lot of things on here.
00:28:03 Have you, have you worked on anything that we would have heard of?
00:28:07 Um, ever watched Ball Masters on Adult Swim?
00:28:12 No.
00:28:13 Just by the, um, the, um, Super Jail creator.
00:28:18 Oh.
00:28:19 And they also did some Super Jail, like early on.
00:28:21 But I interned on Ball Masters and then, uh, went through that, started storyboard revisionisting
00:28:31 on a show called Ducking Goose, which is like a preschool show on Apple TV.
00:28:37 And now I'm a revisionist on a show called Kiff that's coming to, uh, Disney Channel.
00:28:44 It's not out yet?
00:28:46 Not yet.
00:28:47 Hmm.
00:28:48 Okay.
00:28:49 This, this studio seems to be involved with a heck of a lot of shows.
00:28:54 It's very interesting.
00:28:55 I'm on their website right now.
00:28:57 I'm scrolling through this big thing.
00:28:59 I'm seeing, uh-
00:29:01 I got Neo-Yokio in here.
00:29:03 I'm seeing Ducking Goose books.
00:29:05 I assume this show is like based on the, oh no, it's the, I see it on YouTube.
00:29:10 Huh.
00:29:11 Well, that's very interesting.
00:29:14 Well, that's very impressive.
00:29:16 Look at you with your big studio job.
00:29:18 Yeah.
00:29:19 Well, well, well.
00:29:20 Look at you.
00:29:22 Big man coming on our podcast and flexing.
00:29:25 That is real job.
00:29:27 I'm a little, little cog in this big machine of animation.
00:29:31 That's right.
00:29:32 I've gotten like no say in the creative direction of shows.
00:29:36 So I'm not to blame if they're good or not.
00:29:39 Even though I think they are.
00:29:41 I absolve myself of all responsibility.
00:29:45 I'm lucky that I haven't had to work on something that I like don't care about at all.
00:29:51 And I know that's just a part of working in animation is that you're going to get jobs that you just don't like.
00:29:57 Yeah.
00:29:58 But you got to, you got to do your best, I guess.
00:30:01 You got to do it.
00:30:03 That's fair.
00:30:04 That's pretty neat.
00:30:05 That's pretty neat though.
00:30:06 Ball mat.
00:30:07 I've never heard of ball masters, but it kind of looks funny.
00:30:09 I don't know.
00:30:10 Kind of looks a little bit interesting.
00:30:12 I like the style.
00:30:13 It's very, it's very scratchy.
00:30:16 It's very like notebook doodly.
00:30:20 Yeah.
00:30:22 Yeah.
00:30:23 Yeah.
00:30:24 Yeah.
00:30:25 It's a little bit like mob psycho-ish.
00:30:30 Kind of.
00:30:31 A little bit.
00:30:32 I don't know if this was before or after that.
00:30:35 Yeah.
00:30:38 Okay.
00:30:39 All right.
00:30:40 We're good.
00:30:41 Let me tell you a story about my, let me tell you an embarrassing story that sucked for me.
00:30:48 It was just yesterday.
00:30:49 It was on my way home from my stupid family Christmas party.
00:30:58 There was a, there was this girl waiting at the bus stop.
00:31:02 And you know, I just asked her, I just asked like, hey, are you waiting for the 64?
00:31:08 And she just said, yeah.
00:31:10 And then she just, and then she just starts talking to me.
00:31:12 She just starts asking me like questions about like, you know, where are you going?
00:31:18 Do you live around here?
00:31:19 And I'm like, oh, okay.
00:31:21 And I just started answering.
00:31:22 I'm like, yeah, I live around here.
00:31:23 She's like, what do you do for work?
00:31:25 I'm like, oh, I'm a freelancer.
00:31:26 What do you do?
00:31:27 Do you go to school?
00:31:29 She was like a Turkish.
00:31:31 She was like a, she was from Turkey.
00:31:33 She was visiting America while she was learning English or something.
00:31:36 I was like, okay.
00:31:37 All right.
00:31:39 And she said, you know, she just likes to talk to people and like to like talk to
00:31:44 Americans practice English.
00:31:46 And I said, okay, cool.
00:31:48 Yeah.
00:31:49 It was nice.
00:31:50 And then so, you know, then what, what did you do to fumble this?
00:31:54 I killed her.
00:31:55 I buried her in the, she, she went under the bus.
00:31:59 I'm sorry.
00:32:00 She went under the wheels.
00:32:01 I couldn't save her.
00:32:02 No.
00:32:03 Well, she, where was it going?
00:32:07 Okay.
00:32:08 That's my bus comes.
00:32:09 And it's my bus.
00:32:10 And I'm like, okay.
00:32:11 So I go to get on and she is like, uh, uh, she seems like unsure.
00:32:17 And I'm like, is this your bus too?
00:32:19 And she, I don't remember what she said.
00:32:22 And I kind of just was like, well, okay.
00:32:24 And I, and I got on.
00:32:25 And then she also got on even though it wasn't her bus, I think.
00:32:29 And I was like, okay.
00:32:30 And I said, I hope this is going in the right direction.
00:32:33 And she said, yeah, it is.
00:32:34 Yeah, it is.
00:32:35 And I was like, okay.
00:32:36 Um, so I don't know, it was a short bus ride on the bus ride.
00:32:40 I was like, does this girl like me?
00:32:42 Is this, is she following me?
00:32:43 Is she interested?
00:32:44 And so I just asked her like, Hey, well, would you want to meet up sometime in the
00:32:48 future?
00:32:49 Would you want to meet for, I don't know, have a drink or have a coffee or something?
00:32:52 And she just kind of like laugh nervously.
00:32:54 Like she didn't give an answer to that.
00:32:56 And I said, okay.
00:32:57 Well, we don't have to do that.
00:32:58 Well, all right.
00:32:59 Nice, nice meeting you.
00:33:00 Uh, uh, you know, good luck with your studies.
00:33:03 And I got off the bus.
00:33:04 And I, I don't know.
00:33:08 Uh,
00:33:09 I think that's, that's not that embarrassing.
00:33:11 Yeah.
00:33:12 I guess, I guess I don't feel like I did anything particularly wrong, but I, I, I guess she
00:33:17 was just be, I guess she was just being friendly, which is like fine and cool.
00:33:22 But like, man, she should seem like she showed a lot of interest and she even got on a bus
00:33:26 with me that was not her bus.
00:33:28 And I was like, why would you just, why would you do that for a random stranger that you
00:33:32 were just practicing your English on?
00:33:34 I feel like I, I feel like I had reason.
00:33:36 I feel, you know what?
00:33:37 No, I was right.
00:33:38 I was right to ask, you know what was perfectly reasonable thing to do actually.
00:33:43 Maybe perfectly, perfectly sane, perfectly cogent response that I had to that situation
00:33:48 as a matter of fact.
00:33:50 Maybe in Turkey, that's just how they, they do things, you know, if you're talking to
00:33:54 someone, you can't stop talking, you got to talk forever.
00:33:57 Yeah.
00:33:58 You got to get on that wrong bus.
00:34:00 I, I guess we didn't even, we didn't even like say much on the bus.
00:34:05 I don't know why she did that.
00:34:07 She seemed to not, she seemed to not know what bus she was even waiting for.
00:34:15 What's your name?
00:34:16 Her name was like, it was like, it was, it was pronounced weird, it was like booze, booze
00:34:21 or something, booze, I had to, she like, you know, it has one of those like, are those
00:34:28 rhodic sounds that we don't say in English, you know what I mean?
00:34:32 You know what I fucking mean?
00:34:33 Um, I don't know, that was yesterday and, um, you know, what's, what's the point?
00:34:41 What's even the point of anything anymore?
00:34:44 You know?
00:34:45 You can't end every thought with what's the point of anything.
00:34:49 We'll see, we'll see about that.
00:34:53 You say that, but I'll prove you wrong.
00:34:57 But what is the point though, actually, no, stop, stop dodging the question.
00:35:03 I don't know.
00:35:04 Getting on the bus, going to your disc, deadly, deadly comics.
00:35:08 I'm glad you're here.
00:35:09 Why don't girls like me?
00:35:10 It sounds like, explain it to me.
00:35:13 She liked you enough to chat it up with you.
00:35:17 Maybe there was just something lost in translation.
00:35:19 I don't know.
00:35:20 It's not good enough.
00:35:21 I wasn't there.
00:35:22 I think it's good enough.
00:35:23 It's not good enough.
00:35:24 Thank you for your input, but it's not good enough.
00:35:26 You're wrong.
00:35:27 Okay.
00:35:28 Well, that was, all right.
00:35:30 You know what?
00:35:31 That was fine, actually.
00:35:32 Um, uh, well, just thought I'd share my one and only anecdote, um, up until yesterday.
00:35:41 Up until yesterday, I also have done nothing, uh, I pretty much, I pretty much wasted this
00:35:46 past week.
00:35:47 I know I said I had to work on that book and getting it done.
00:35:49 I, I like didn't.
00:35:50 I did that for like one day.
00:35:52 It's just, it's just, it's cold and I just, it's just too cold.
00:35:58 And the heating is off more often now because of like, uh, oil prices, Ukraine, specifically
00:36:08 the UK's like, stupid, uh, like not taxing of the billion dollar, like oil companies.
00:36:18 Just despite the fact that they're, they're making record profits right now and we have
00:36:24 our own oil we can get, uh, it, you know, the Russia's war in Ukraine should not be
00:36:30 affecting the price of stuff so much, but they're just letting it affect the price so
00:36:34 much, uh, so that people die in their millions.
00:36:39 That's, that's what they're doing.
00:36:40 They're making me too cold.
00:36:42 So I can't, I can't do my little drawings and it's, it's sad.
00:36:47 They're doing it specifically to prevent you from doing your little drawings and you
00:36:51 can't, you can't let them win.
00:36:54 I tried to draw a little drawing and I was just like, ooh, no, I can't, I can't have
00:36:58 my hand outside of my blanket holding a stylus.
00:37:01 Got to put it back in there.
00:37:03 Got to hide it in this blanket.
00:37:04 Speaking of, that's my week.
00:37:06 Speaking of blankets and being cold, I watched my dinner with Andre yesterday.
00:37:13 Well, yesterday, I split it between yesterday and the day before.
00:37:17 Because it just randomly came across my YouTube recommendations.
00:37:21 It was called your dinner with Andre.
00:37:22 It was the video.
00:37:24 It was on a channel with 600 subscribers.
00:37:26 It had like 150,000 views.
00:37:28 It's just called your dinner with Andre, but it's just an unedited upload of my
00:37:32 dinner with Andre.
00:37:33 Have you seen this film?
00:37:35 No, I have not.
00:37:37 You are you familiar, are you familiar with it?
00:37:39 Nope.
00:37:39 Nope.
00:37:40 It's a, it's a Wallace, Sean and Andre Gregory.
00:37:45 And it's pretty much just them sitting down to dinner and, and they just talk for
00:37:50 like an hour and hour and a half.
00:37:52 And that's the movie.
00:37:53 And Andre or, uh-huh?
00:37:56 Is it just them talking as themselves?
00:37:59 Just them talking.
00:38:01 They're, they're, they're, no, they're, they're technically playing characters.
00:38:05 They're, they're, they're characters have their real names, but they are not playing
00:38:09 themselves.
00:38:10 Andre is playing a version of himself who had all these weird, like spiritual
00:38:15 awakening experiences in like the forests of Poland or whatever.
00:38:19 And he's describing to Wallace all these, uh, all these things.
00:38:25 Um, wall, wall is Sean, by the way, is the guy who, uh, played fizz, fizzig in, um,
00:38:32 the, uh, the princess bride.
00:38:35 Yeah.
00:38:36 I know him.
00:38:36 Yeah.
00:38:36 I don't know Andre.
00:38:38 Uh, yeah, I didn't know Andre from other stuff either.
00:38:42 I know him mostly from my dinner with Andre.
00:38:45 Um, you know, wall, wall is Sean's character in them.
00:38:49 I'm not sure if it's, if he's badly written or if he's written to be
00:38:54 infuriating, but he is like the worst conversationalists ever.
00:39:00 He just sits that he just listens to Andre explain to him like these most like
00:39:05 bizarre, like, uh, psychedelic experiences.
00:39:09 And that he's like, and then he's just like, and he'll just like smirk and
00:39:13 literally not say anything and then go back to eating his soup.
00:39:16 And then he'll be like, uh, so what happened next?
00:39:19 And like, that's, that's what he says.
00:39:22 Fuck you, wall.
00:39:25 So what happened?
00:39:27 There's a couple of times that he breaks in with his own, with his own like input,
00:39:30 but it literally takes like an hour into the movie before he replies with
00:39:34 anything other than, so what else did you do?
00:39:38 That's kind of like, I'm thinking about it, but it's, it feels like a
00:39:43 conversation couldn't hold an entire movie length.
00:39:45 But we talk for like hours on this podcast.
00:39:49 We talk, yeah.
00:39:50 Like conversations take a lot longer.
00:39:52 And then I'm thinking, wait a minute, how the fuck do they fit conversations
00:39:56 into movies normally with scenes?
00:39:59 Right.
00:40:00 How the hell do they do that?
00:40:01 Right.
00:40:01 You like, you can't, you can't put like a real
00:40:05 I think this is kind of like, I think there's, you know, last year I went on
00:40:12 this kick of watching movies that were just about people talking.
00:40:16 I asked people on Twitter for recommendations of movies where people
00:40:18 just talk and that's all that happens.
00:40:20 And I watched a bunch of them and most of them I liked.
00:40:24 And yeah, I think there's something that's very, that's very, uh, uh, very
00:40:30 artificial about like the way that like characters interact with each other in
00:40:35 just, in like normal movies, cause normal, normal movies, like nobody can just
00:40:39 have like a conversation with each other.
00:40:41 Because yeah, every scene has to be over in like a minute 30.
00:40:45 And that's just not real life.
00:40:49 Uh, I get the very cliffs notes.
00:40:51 It's very stilted.
00:40:52 Yeah.
00:40:52 It's very condensed and stilted and very like theatrical.
00:40:56 And that's why just like in real life, just like in real life, every
00:40:59 conversation that I has has to progress the plot or else what's the point, right?
00:41:05 You can't, you can't talk to a Turkish lady on the bus or the bus stop without
00:41:10 it leading to like, like a, you know, setting up for act two.
00:41:15 Why, why didn't it do nothing happen?
00:41:16 Yeah, this would be called a drop plot point.
00:41:19 This was in the film.
00:41:21 Yeah.
00:41:21 That was, you know, in reviewing, reviewing, uh, you know, Ben's life, uh,
00:41:28 release date, uh, 1988 to, uh, to, uh, nine to 2022.
00:41:36 Yeah.
00:41:36 That scene with Buzra on the bus, like total plot called a sack.
00:41:40 Nope.
00:41:40 Should have been, should have been cut from the final edit.
00:41:43 Wait, wait, I don't like the audience doesn't want their time wasted.
00:41:48 So, but think about what it says about Ben's character.
00:41:51 Yeah, no, it's character building.
00:41:52 It's like we're painting, you know, it's not about progressing the plot.
00:41:55 It's a character piece.
00:41:56 It's a character study of a pitiful waste of a man who's a waste of his life.
00:42:01 And he has nothing to offer society.
00:42:03 Right.
00:42:03 It's about, it's about establishing that.
00:42:05 It's about painting a picture for the audience.
00:42:07 You Philistine appreciate it.
00:42:09 Exactly.
00:42:11 What's your act three going to be, Ben?
00:42:16 Oh, God.
00:42:21 Well, I guess, I don't know.
00:42:23 We'll just, we'll just have to see.
00:42:25 Um, you know, anyway, I thought watching, watching my dinner with Andre, I was like,
00:42:32 they should do, I should, I should do what they did with the worst, the worst idea ever,
00:42:37 podcast or whatever it's called, where they watched, um, grownups to every week.
00:42:42 And then they commented on new things they noticed in grownups too.
00:42:45 What if we did that with my dinner with Andre?
00:42:47 We could call it my podcast with Andre.
00:42:50 Every week, you're just like, Hey, I noticed that like, it's weird how it's weird how Wally
00:42:59 just like casually brings up that story about the wait, like the woman, that woman who fell
00:43:06 out of her hospital bed and, and like became, became a, you know, paralyzed.
00:43:11 Like, wait, he, I didn't realize that was Andre's mom.
00:43:14 We, at the, at the first, I thought he was, he was talking about someone else's mom, but
00:43:17 then later he brings it up and he's talking about Andre's mom, plot hole, uh, uh, stuff
00:43:23 like that.
00:43:24 Um, sounds like a terrible idea.
00:43:26 It sounds too cyclical for me, like people talking about, people talking about people
00:43:33 having the same conversation, people having the same conversation, noticing things about
00:43:38 the same conversation over and over again.
00:43:39 I think, I kind of think the movie is ass.
00:43:42 I kind of think it's bad.
00:43:44 I kind of think that's not true.
00:43:46 It's not bad, but I do think that there's parts mostly Wally where he's speaking in
00:43:52 a way that does not sound to me like a real person talking.
00:43:57 It sounds scripted in a way that is like, okay, here's the part where we have him make
00:44:03 a point.
00:44:04 Here's the part where we have him push back on like, here, here, here's the part where
00:44:08 we have him expound a worldview that the audience has meant to shake their heads out and say,
00:44:13 ugh, disgusting, despicable.
00:44:17 You know, how dare, how dare he?
00:44:21 They should make a sequel called My Edibles with Andre.
00:44:28 They're both, they're both still alive.
00:44:30 They're both very old.
00:44:33 He should do some big weeds.
00:44:36 See if it's different.
00:44:37 That's the conversation I want to hear.
00:44:40 Let me call it like, like my, my, my blunt rotation with Andre.
00:44:48 My bong with Andre.
00:44:50 My puff, puff pass with Andre.
00:44:57 That's all I got.
00:44:58 That's all I got.
00:45:00 Well, it was nice having you on deadly.
00:45:03 Is that it?
00:45:05 No, I didn't say anything.
00:45:06 It's all time.
00:45:08 Well, I haven't, I have no, I have no notes this week.
00:45:11 I'm just, I'm just spitball and I'm trying to think of everything.
00:45:14 Well, I got a question.
00:45:15 I got a question for deadly comics.
00:45:17 Maybe this is widely known already and I just haven't looked into it.
00:45:21 But did you have a comic that was deadly?
00:45:25 Is that why you're named deadly comics?
00:45:26 That's a great question.
00:45:29 The comic wasn't deadly.
00:45:31 I think that just came from like being a little kid in school and wanting to have a
00:45:36 comic company named a deadly comic because I thought that sounded cool.
00:45:41 That is cool.
00:45:43 Now it's just a username that doesn't mean anything.
00:45:47 Your, your cartoons are not.
00:45:51 I'm sorry, I'm sorry to.
00:45:53 They're just not that deadly.
00:45:54 They just don't, they just don't come off as particularly deadly to me.
00:45:58 When I see the little raccoons and cats and stuff, rabbits, little dinosaur, man.
00:46:04 Not yet.
00:46:04 I just think this can change.
00:46:06 Oh, no, there's going to be blood and hyper realistic blood in the new one.
00:46:13 We'll see.
00:46:13 We'll see.
00:46:16 OK, well, I'm unsettled.
00:46:22 The deadliest comic is the one you weren't expecting.
00:46:24 But did you, did you, I mean, you're an animator.
00:46:26 Did you used to draw comics?
00:46:28 Oh, yeah.
00:46:28 Oh, yeah.
00:46:30 Before I knew I could animate instead.
00:46:33 I see.
00:46:34 That's funny because I did the opposite.
00:46:37 I tried animating because I thought that was what I was good at.
00:46:40 But in-betweens are annoying.
00:46:43 And I prefer just drawing the one frame.
00:46:45 So I just do that in a comic forum.
00:46:48 I don't know.
00:46:49 In-betweens for me are like therapeutic.
00:46:51 I think they can be.
00:46:52 Yeah.
00:46:53 Comics and animation are so close, though.
00:46:55 I heard a quote somewhere like that everyone in animation wants to do comics
00:46:59 and everyone in comics wants to do animation.
00:47:01 That's so funny.
00:47:03 It is kind of like a storyboard.
00:47:04 It's just sort of like not framed in a screen form.
00:47:08 You can change the shape of the.
00:47:11 True, yeah, yeah.
00:47:13 And it kind of, your head puts in the in-betweens.
00:47:15 That's how it works.
00:47:16 Your head fills in the space that's not there.
00:47:20 I've read, what is it called?
00:47:24 Is it drawing words and writing pictures?
00:47:29 The one by Scott McLeod?
00:47:31 Oh, that's Understanding Comics.
00:47:34 That's the one I read.
00:47:35 I think he has two.
00:47:36 I think he has another one.
00:47:38 He has a bunch, yeah.
00:47:40 Yeah.
00:47:40 I've seen bits of those.
00:47:41 I still haven't sat down and read each either one of them.
00:47:45 I know I've read one of them.
00:47:47 I might have read both.
00:47:48 I think there's one called Understanding Comics.
00:47:50 I've definitely read Understanding Comics and there's also,
00:47:52 I think he's another one called Drawing Words and Writing Pictures.
00:47:55 And yeah, you know, I think in that he sort of explains that like
00:48:00 the comic kind of happens in between the panels.
00:48:03 Like the action of it is when your mind is sort of filling in
00:48:08 the movement in between.
00:48:11 Yeah, yeah.
00:48:12 Yeah, that's sort of the, when at all, where the magic happens.
00:48:17 That's what I really like about like an action scene in a comic where I'm,
00:48:22 I try, well, I don't try, but I always subconsciously want to think of it
00:48:27 as like an animation.
00:48:28 And then I'm, I'm like showing just the important bits.
00:48:31 So like you can infer how the person moved their hand to get to the next
00:48:37 panel from the previous panel, even though the camera is like,
00:48:41 is a different position.
00:48:43 It's like, if this was a storyboard, you could turn it into like a full
00:48:48 like motion would be like, it would work.
00:48:52 And that's what they do with, you know, every, every manga ever.
00:48:57 That's how the animation adaptation, a lot of them are like super close
00:49:00 because the comics are already so, so clear in the posing and the staging
00:49:05 and everything.
00:49:07 Mm hmm.
00:49:08 Mm hmm.
00:49:11 Yeah, kind of, kind of similar, kind of, kind of sort of use similar
00:49:17 conventions in both, both mediums.
00:49:22 Isn't that interesting?
00:49:23 Isn't that, isn't that neat?
00:49:26 Um, I'm sure no one's drawn a comparison before.
00:49:30 Mm hmm.
00:49:31 Yes, we were, I think we're really smart.
00:49:34 I think that like, do you think that maybe like the same guy like invented
00:49:40 both things?
00:49:44 Well, like Disney or Tezuka, I was thinking of Tezuka.
00:49:48 I was thinking, I was thinking of Tezuka.
00:49:50 Does Tezuka do animation?
00:49:52 Well, I know he's the manga boy, but like, I
00:49:54 don't know whether he's specifically animated.
00:49:57 Well, wasn't it him that sort of, uh, invent, like made up the convention
00:50:01 of animating on threes to save budget?
00:50:05 That's what I've heard, yeah, with those old Astro boys and everything.
00:50:09 Yeah.
00:50:10 He definitely would have been involved.
00:50:11 Yeah, I guess.
00:50:12 Uh, I mean, I, yeah, I guess I don't know if he like, if he like drew like cells
00:50:18 himself or anything like that.
00:50:20 Maybe he didn't.
00:50:22 Um, I think he did.
00:50:23 He's got like, I know he's done some cool experimental short films and stuff.
00:50:30 Oh yeah.
00:50:30 But he had like a whole studio for the, like the anime series, things like that.
00:50:36 Just like, just like, uh, just like George Lucas.
00:50:40 And now, now he makes secret personal films just for himself that no one
00:50:44 will ever see.
00:50:45 Is that true?
00:50:46 Well, that's what he, that's what he says in interviews.
00:50:48 It's like, so what are you doing now that like you're a, you're washed up and
00:50:52 he's like, Oh, you know, I'm making, I'm making a small personal experimental
00:50:58 films that will never be seen by the public.
00:51:01 And it's like, okay.
00:51:03 Okay.
00:51:03 Got it.
00:51:04 Okay.
00:51:04 Whatever.
00:51:05 Have fun.
00:51:06 I guess like doing stop motion with green plastic army, man.
00:51:12 It's a whole new medium.
00:51:13 It's a whole new artistic medium.
00:51:15 It's never been tried.
00:51:17 Um,
00:51:21 I'm still, I'm still looking at the image search for ball masters.
00:51:25 So,
00:51:26 this girl with the green hair is pretty.
00:51:29 I don't want to have sex with her.
00:51:33 Shut up.
00:51:33 Good luck.
00:51:34 Okay.
00:51:34 I'm sorry.
00:51:35 I apologize.
00:51:37 Deadly.
00:51:38 How, cause I know you were like, at least you knew about me cause you drew that
00:51:43 gif, how did you find out about this, this group?
00:51:48 Um, I guess through you, I think I saw your things through, um, like a crown prince
00:51:55 animation that she did with like Dr.
00:51:58 Wolfe and stuff.
00:52:01 Oh, crown prince.
00:52:03 Yes.
00:52:04 Of course.
00:52:05 Talk about a blast from the past.
00:52:07 Talk about it.
00:52:08 Yeah.
00:52:09 Was, we're just giving a, was it a moment with Dr.
00:52:12 Wolfe?
00:52:13 Uh, you know, I'm trying to think, I think, I remember there was a crown prince, like
00:52:20 animation thing she did.
00:52:24 And then I edited part of it to link it to something.
00:52:30 I don't know what I have.
00:52:31 There's, there's, yeah, I remember it.
00:52:33 I remember I was in there and then I touched a painting and I got zipped into the
00:52:38 moment with Dr.
00:52:39 Wolfe, which was drawn by her, I think.
00:52:42 Yeah.
00:52:43 That sounds familiar.
00:52:46 Cause it wasn't me who drew it.
00:52:47 I drew the, the voice of reason one, the original.
00:52:52 Oh, that's right.
00:52:53 Oh my God, you drew the original.
00:52:55 How you, you started it.
00:52:57 I started it.
00:52:58 You started the madness.
00:53:00 I forgot about that, but that's true.
00:53:03 Oh my God.
00:53:05 But the first one, the first one was funny.
00:53:07 The first one was like a joke.
00:53:09 I know it was like a reason, like obviously, like knew it was like, oh,
00:53:13 it's so fucking silly, the idea of going to a wolf to talk about like your,
00:53:18 your, your manic, your, your, your, your, your cycle, the psychological
00:53:22 problems of your OC, like, like the cycle of the problems of your OC and
00:53:26 hating like friendship is witchcraft or something.
00:53:30 Yeah.
00:53:30 Like, like he knows, he knew it was silly.
00:53:32 And so he wrote it to me that way.
00:53:34 And I, it's a funny bit to bring your OC into a therapist and have your OC do
00:53:38 like discuss their like character quirks, as though they're like a
00:53:41 psychological like neurosis that they have to try and overcome.
00:53:45 Like that's a funny bit.
00:53:47 And then immediately they drop it and they just are coming in to be like,
00:53:50 I'm bullied at school for being a brony.
00:53:52 And I need this YouTuber to explain to me what I should do about that or whatever.
00:53:58 And it just became the worst thing ever.
00:54:01 I forget what the crown prince one, like the, my one, like I forgot what
00:54:06 I said in my one.
00:54:07 Yeah.
00:54:08 I don't think it was that good.
00:54:10 It was nicely animated, though.
00:54:12 That was, that was the fun part.
00:54:13 I mean, mine was about Phantom Horn, uh, base.
00:54:16 I mean, that was, that was in the era of Phantom Horn, where he was just
00:54:19 unironically a like, haha, aren't SJW stupid, like guy.
00:54:24 So his, his thing is literally like, people miss species me and that's a problem.
00:54:30 But also like, haha, isn't it funny that that would be a problem someone would have?
00:54:33 Well, so, you know, pretty, pretty cool, pretty awesome.
00:54:39 Pretty great.
00:54:40 I'm looking at his channel and he's still, he's still cooking.
00:54:43 He's still cooking.
00:54:44 Let him cook.
00:54:45 Good for him.
00:54:46 Let him cook.
00:54:51 I don't see the therapist things much anymore.
00:54:54 It seems like it's more just, you know, talking about the show and stuff.
00:54:57 Yeah, I think I, I would assume he pivoted to talking about the CG stuff.
00:55:03 Yeah, as you see in that.
00:55:07 I saw the movie.
00:55:08 I saw the movie.
00:55:09 I don't think I don't know much about the show.
00:55:13 I assume it's just the characters from the movie having like little moments,
00:55:17 little fun things.
00:55:19 Oh my God, analysis anarchy.
00:55:21 They're still so prominent.
00:55:23 Eight days, eight days ago, they did another analysis anarchy.
00:55:29 The longest running series in YouTube history will be analysis anarchy.
00:55:33 OK, all right.
00:55:35 Mercifully, it doesn't seem like it's that popular anymore.
00:55:37 It only got, it only got nine K views in the, in the week it's been out.
00:55:41 So nine thousands, a lot of people.
00:55:43 I know, but it used to be, it used to be a lot more.
00:55:48 I scroll down a little bit.
00:55:49 There's more analysis anarchy and it's like 30 K, 31 K.
00:55:53 TF2 analysis, TF2 analysis, season seven, the movie part one.
00:55:59 Wait, what TF2 analysis, season seven, the movie part one three weeks ago,
00:56:05 an hour long, five thousand views.
00:56:11 OK, what?
00:56:14 It's when they say TF2 analysis, do they mean analysis anarchy?
00:56:18 Yes, that's why it's been so confusing.
00:56:20 It's why do they, why don't they call it analysis is the analysis
00:56:25 community of MLP and they play TF2 together.
00:56:29 So it's TF2 analysis for short, which confuses everybody
00:56:33 because that's not what it sounds like.
00:56:34 It's not, no, it's this doesn't make any fucking sense.
00:56:38 The show, am I crazy?
00:56:40 Is the show not called analysis anarchy?
00:56:44 It was initially TF2 analysis anarchy.
00:56:47 So why is this compilation called TF2 analysis?
00:56:55 Per colon quotation mark, season seven, the movie, parentheses, part one.
00:57:01 End quotation mark.
00:57:03 Why?
00:57:05 I mean, why not?
00:57:08 I guess it's not going to bring in more viewers, but the people
00:57:11 that know are going to know what they're clicking on.
00:57:15 Look, I just look, maybe I'm I'm sorry.
00:57:17 I might be the only one that cares about this.
00:57:19 I just why did they take a word out of the title of the show
00:57:23 when they they've always done that, though, they always do.
00:57:27 They talk, they say TF2 analysis, like, like interchangeably with analysis anarchy.
00:57:33 Maybe anarchy gets their video demonetized or something.
00:57:37 I guess I shouldn't complain because we are the PCP, but our logo
00:57:43 has always been TPC.
00:57:45 So I have no, I have, right, I have no room to complain.
00:57:49 Okay, it's fine.
00:57:50 Okay, so, so that's how you found me through the Crown Prince video.
00:57:56 Yeah, and then I just went to every possible way I could, you know,
00:58:00 listen to your voice some more.
00:58:04 That's true.
00:58:05 Oh, no, it's true.
00:58:08 It's true.
00:58:10 And then I found the PCP and then everything collapsed.
00:58:16 And then we have a pandemic.
00:58:18 And then surely, surely more time elapsed between those two things.
00:58:26 Does that mean you've seen my comics?
00:58:29 I have some of them, some of them.
00:58:32 For some reason, I have, I don't spend a lot of time reading web
00:58:36 comics anymore, but I got the load of ghost books and it's on my shelf.
00:58:41 Yes, I remember.
00:58:41 Oh, hell yeah, you bought one of those.
00:58:43 Hell yeah.
00:58:44 Yeah, that's good stuff.
00:58:47 How many of my comics did you buy?
00:58:50 Ben.
00:58:51 No, I know.
00:58:53 Ellie is our cut this.
00:58:54 Ellie is our cut this far.
00:58:56 Ben's taking the biggest L of his career.
00:58:59 Don't actually know you mostly for your Winnie the Pooh videos.
00:59:03 What?
00:59:04 Really?
00:59:04 That's true.
00:59:05 It's true.
00:59:05 I love those videos.
00:59:06 No one talks about them.
00:59:08 That's actually really funny.
00:59:10 Yeah, you created a niche and then you filled that niche.
00:59:14 Yeah, and then you disappeared.
00:59:16 I still do mean to go back and finish.
00:59:19 You know what?
00:59:19 Maybe I should, I have never entirely abandoned the thought that I will
00:59:25 finish at least season one of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.
00:59:29 It's good.
00:59:30 I want you to get to my favorite episode.
00:59:33 Which one's that?
00:59:34 It's called Party Pooper.
00:59:37 Rapid throws a party, but is too controlling, too hard-headed about it.
00:59:47 So it's no fun for anyone.
00:59:50 I don't know.
00:59:52 I don't know if I remember that one.
00:59:53 I'm not sure if I've seen that one.
00:59:56 I don't even know what season it is.
00:59:58 Like as a kid, I had a VHS with three episodes on it.
01:00:02 And as a kid, I thought that's all that there was.
01:00:05 And then just stand up.
01:00:06 There was, you know, more episodes, a whole show.
01:00:09 Yeah.
01:00:09 So I just would just re-watch three episodes over and over.
01:00:12 But after watching your videos, they like founded on Disney Plus
01:00:17 and have been watching the rest of it.
01:00:19 Oh, my God.
01:00:20 It's a good show.
01:00:21 That's very interesting.
01:00:22 I think it was.
01:00:23 It was a pretty good show, you know, for what it was.
01:00:29 Yeah, thanks for reminding me.
01:00:30 I do I haven't been thinking about it that much lately, but like I would.
01:00:34 I've told people before that, like, I will eventually finish season one.
01:00:38 There's not even that much more of season one, honestly.
01:00:41 I could probably just do it.
01:00:43 You know, I've been I've been thinking, though, about.
01:00:46 You know what I want to do?
01:00:47 And I think I think I missed an opportunity by not streaming myself
01:00:53 playing the Mega Man games while I was getting ready for the Mega Man video.
01:00:57 I think I want to start streaming myself playing the battle network games
01:01:02 in preparation for whenever I eventually do
01:01:06 like the battle network continuity lecture.
01:01:10 Because I'm definitely going to do that at some point.
01:01:12 So I definitely need to play those games.
01:01:14 So I might as well stream them.
01:01:16 So I need to get like better internet so I can actually stream without it
01:01:20 like crashing all the time.
01:01:22 So yeah, that's my that's my next that's my next big move.
01:01:28 That's my next power play.
01:01:30 My memory of battle network is watching people who own that game play it.
01:01:35 And I then understand why why you were in a grid
01:01:38 and why you couldn't run around and shoot things.
01:01:41 Yeah, I've I've never played one.
01:01:43 I've seen it and I guess I I guess I understand that it's like a strategic.
01:01:49 It's like a strategy RPG, but like on a very small grid, basically.
01:01:54 That makes sense.
01:01:55 And I think there's card mechanics that I think it might be a little bit
01:01:59 like give or play chain of memories. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
01:02:02 I think there might sort of be like you have cards in your deck
01:02:04 that you play like attacks and chain of memories, but it's on a grid, I think.
01:02:08 OK, I don't think my my child brain would not have been able to comprehend that.
01:02:15 I mean, I cards and a grid.
01:02:17 No, thank you.
01:02:18 I mean, I did manage to play chain of memories when it was new,
01:02:21 although I was not that young for that.
01:02:25 I think I think I probably
01:02:27 I think I probably could have gotten into battle network if if I had tried it
01:02:31 at the time, but I was more into the action jump and shoot man of zero,
01:02:38 which I think was coming out around the same time.
01:02:42 And, you know, I had a limited budget for video games.
01:02:47 I wasn't allowed to play battle network
01:02:48 because of all the violence in the world.
01:02:50 Battling was is too much too dangerous.
01:02:53 That's not true. That's not true.
01:02:57 And networking.
01:02:59 I was so scared of socializing and I couldn't.
01:03:01 I wasn't allowed to play Mega Man because my parents thought it was
01:03:06 unfeminist, like we already have men that are already, you know,
01:03:10 just a press environment.
01:03:12 Why we don't need Mega Man to do it even more.
01:03:18 And they were with a mega picture, yeah.
01:03:22 And to this day, we only have one female robot master.
01:03:27 Two, if you count role.
01:03:32 What the fuck are we talking about?
01:03:36 Oh, finding each other on YouTube and stuff.
01:03:41 Well, I don't know anything.
01:03:45 I remember feeling like really cool when my little give and take channel
01:03:50 got like subscribers from people who are like big like you.
01:03:54 Deadly Comics had a lot of views on like your Scootaloo animations
01:03:57 and you were like loads of subscribers.
01:03:59 And I was like, oh, my God, Deadly Comics follows me.
01:04:02 You were more subscribers than I was.
01:04:04 I was more, you know,
01:04:08 I was more ecstatic when I saw you upload the give and take jump.
01:04:13 Oh, yeah. Oh, what was that?
01:04:16 Oh, no, it was just for like.
01:04:18 I got the GIF and then I put like a Led Zeppelin song on it.
01:04:21 And I think Led Zeppelin took it down or something.
01:04:26 Hey, hey, did you know that like on YouTube are our channels at
01:04:30 is at the procrastinators 9667?
01:04:35 Is that something they gave to you?
01:04:37 I guess they like a guy in the email saying that YouTube has handles now
01:04:42 and that you could select your handle.
01:04:45 They've had them.
01:04:46 I don't remember ever selecting it.
01:04:48 I don't know why ours is 9667.
01:04:51 I feel like maybe it used to be just at the procrastinators
01:04:53 and maybe it got changed after the Brad Garlinghouse hack.
01:04:56 Oh, probably that sucks.
01:04:58 That's stupid.
01:05:00 I don't like that.
01:05:02 Maybe there's a way to change it back.
01:05:04 I I was just looking at the channel, though,
01:05:06 because I am I'm actually right on the cusp.
01:05:09 I have almost my channel has almost surpassed the PCP in subscribers.
01:05:14 I think the PCP is a twenty five point two K.
01:05:16 I am at like twenty five point one K.
01:05:19 Well, so any day now, the only thing that could beat you was yourself.
01:05:25 Exactly. I cheated on the game, but myself hypocrite.
01:05:29 I think Pita like twenty K.
01:05:32 I've been Ben St. Channel had been at twenty K for a long time,
01:05:37 and now it got a big couple, couple thousand more recently.
01:05:41 So cha-ching cha-ching.
01:05:44 Oh, yeah.
01:05:51 Did I mention that Chugga Conroy added me on Twitter?
01:05:56 I saw that.
01:05:57 Yeah, I know Chugga Conroy from like gaming stuff,
01:06:02 but I wasn't an avid watcher.
01:06:03 I just know I just know the name.
01:06:05 I just know he's a big name.
01:06:07 And so I tried to ask him if he he's
01:06:09 well, he said on Twitter that he would he would love
01:06:11 he said he would pay good money to be in the audience for a lecture.
01:06:15 And I was like, oh, shit.
01:06:17 So I tried to ask him if you wanted to come on the podcast
01:06:19 and I didn't get a response, which is too bad because like the same.
01:06:24 It's not the same as a big like, no, it's not the same.
01:06:27 Well, I mean, I mean, I wasn't going to do another lecture with an audience.
01:06:31 I wasn't planning on it.
01:06:32 So like maybe maybe you could check out Conroy could pay the big money
01:06:40 to just sit in front of you while you do your next lecture.
01:06:42 Could he just give me big money?
01:06:45 And that's it.
01:06:47 Could he just give me some good money?
01:06:49 You just invite him to your house.
01:06:51 He sits down.
01:06:52 What if we just did that?
01:06:54 I mean, honestly, if you wanted, if like him and maybe a couple other people,
01:07:00 maybe like Cybershell and maybe like a few others.
01:07:06 I mean, I guess we could just organize a lecture thing.
01:07:11 Anyway, I would still be down to come to America to sit at a lecture.
01:07:16 The only reason it didn't work last time because it's a covid happened.
01:07:19 I got covid.
01:07:20 Yeah. I mean, we could do that, I guess.
01:07:24 What's the next topic?
01:07:26 Just for fun.
01:07:27 Well, I don't know.
01:07:28 I would have to pick something else because I was going to do.
01:07:33 Well, I don't want to get I don't want to get into it.
01:07:34 Tf2 analysis anarchy.
01:07:36 Oh, my. You know what?
01:07:38 You know what?
01:07:40 I thought about it many times, but it's just like that.
01:07:43 You would have to watch it.
01:07:44 There's 16 hours of tf.
01:07:46 There's probably like wait, no, there's not.
01:07:48 Well, there's there's probably like seven hours.
01:07:50 There's probably like there's probably like five to seven hours.
01:07:53 There's seven five to seven too many.
01:07:57 It would be it actually would be really funny.
01:07:59 I'm going to put that on.
01:08:00 I'm going to put that on.
01:08:01 No, I'm going to put that on the list, actually.
01:08:04 I care about my mental health too much.
01:08:07 How many people would?
01:08:10 It would have to be people clicking on it who know what the tf2 analysis thing is.
01:08:16 How many people are there?
01:08:18 I mean, it could be an introductory thing.
01:08:20 Like that's true.
01:08:21 Like a weird niche of Brony subculture.
01:08:24 Like, hello, everyone.
01:08:25 I'm here to talk to you about this stupid thing that's insane that it exists.
01:08:29 Now, that's now that's what the Brony lecture should have been.
01:08:34 Is explaining like, who is Dr. Wolf?
01:08:36 Who is Josh Scorcher?
01:08:37 Who is I love Kim possible?
01:08:39 A lot. Who is Silverquill?
01:08:41 Where are they now? Yeah.
01:08:42 Oh, they're still there.
01:08:44 Yeah, they haven't gone anywhere.
01:08:49 Uh, and take.
01:08:51 Oh, where is Gibbon take?
01:08:53 That's like, I mean, you almost like like a compelling idea
01:08:57 in sort of the same vein of like, like what is like unicorn jelly
01:09:00 and pastel defender heliotrope?
01:09:02 Like, like what is this bizarre like, what is the rift?
01:09:06 What is the rift cafe?
01:09:09 The story, the history of the rift cafe.
01:09:11 That's a much better Brony lecture than the actual Brony lecture was,
01:09:15 which is just talking about was actually available.
01:09:17 Brony knowledge was actually just a history of the PCP.
01:09:21 Yeah, publicly available.
01:09:22 Brony knowledge mixed with how did the PCP form, which is like fine.
01:09:28 Um, I made a new fucking RuneScape video.
01:09:32 That's one thing I did.
01:09:34 Oh, why?
01:09:35 It's a it's a it's only a little thing.
01:09:37 Um, just as an update, because I finally I chopped enough of the trees
01:09:43 for my fletching challenge.
01:09:46 Oh, very good.
01:09:47 It was twenty eight thousand something you logs.
01:09:51 And they're in my bank.
01:09:53 And I just showed the people that I did that.
01:09:55 And I laughed in insanely.
01:09:59 I coughed and then I laughed and I was insane about like, what the fuck?
01:10:05 And then I then I then that's it.
01:10:07 It sounds very, very in character for you.
01:10:12 It's not much.
01:10:14 I just felt like like I didn't know what milestones to make.
01:10:17 It was a very small milestone.
01:10:19 But the next milestone will probably be like two years in the future
01:10:22 because of the amount of coal I need to get.
01:10:25 And the amount of time I'm willing to spend like focusing on that
01:10:29 as opposed to having it in the background.
01:10:33 I've been playing Noida again, and that's bad.
01:10:36 Noida is a bad game.
01:10:39 That's the one with all the sane and all the pixels.
01:10:42 Yes, yes, the pixel sands.
01:10:44 I wanted to play that.
01:10:45 It looks fun.
01:10:46 It is a good it's a good game and it's a fun game.
01:10:49 But I like I don't mean to toot my own horn or anything,
01:10:53 but I have kind of mastered it to the point that like
01:10:57 win, lose, like whatever, playing it is pretty formulaic at this point.
01:11:01 I know I know how to build a wand that wins the game.
01:11:05 And it's just a question of like how how quick how quick do I get that wand?
01:11:10 And then like, do I survive?
01:11:14 Do do I do something stupid that kills me or do I not?
01:11:18 So I'm not I'm not getting anything more out of it anymore.
01:11:23 So I really should just stop playing it.
01:11:25 And yet I and yet I continue
01:11:28 because it still feels good when I get a wand that goes burr
01:11:32 and just blasts out damage when it still gives me that visceral power feeling
01:11:37 and I crave it.
01:11:38 I just want to destroy my enemies.
01:11:40 It's it lets me it lets me live that.
01:11:43 Anyway, anyway,
01:11:47 300,000 views on the Mega Man video, by the way,
01:11:49 we passed 300,000 is a yay, yay.
01:11:53 Thank you. I'm very happy.
01:11:55 I'm very happy about it.
01:11:56 300,000 times eight.
01:11:58 Now, how many hours?
01:12:00 Oh, actually, well, actually, the watch time,
01:12:03 well, because the average view is not eight hours long, the total watch
01:12:07 hours, cowards, the total watch time on the video is two hundred and twenty eight
01:12:12 thousand hours.
01:12:15 Fuck, which is two hundred and twenty eight thousand hours.
01:12:22 In years.
01:12:25 That's 26 years, 26 years of useful human
01:12:30 endeavor and energy have been wasted.
01:12:33 That's how long I've been alive.
01:12:35 Yeah.
01:12:36 Well, so either you do whatever you were doing or you watch Ben St.
01:12:41 's lecture over and over again.
01:12:43 My lecture is is is pretty much equal in value to your entire life.
01:12:50 If I would say so, I would say so.
01:12:52 Oh, yeah. Thanks.
01:12:55 Hang on. I need to get a drink.
01:12:56 I'll be one second.
01:12:58 Just you and me now give and take.
01:13:00 Oh, no. My dreams have come true.
01:13:05 So did you you I guess you listen to the podcast?
01:13:09 Yeah, I think I stopped at some point and then I came back
01:13:14 and I didn't realize it had still been going all this time.
01:13:17 This is an old podcast.
01:13:20 Oh, we're still trekking.
01:13:23 It's been it's been it's been 80 years.
01:13:28 The we you know, I've been trying.
01:13:32 I've been trying to create a vegetarian or vegan
01:13:36 gummy alternative to the ones that I've been making
01:13:40 because the ones because the ones that I've been making
01:13:44 you know, they use gelatin, which is made with animal products.
01:13:48 And my mom asked like if they're because I guess my sister has become a vegetarian
01:13:52 and my mom asked if there was like a vegetarian way to make them.
01:13:57 And I said, I don't know, maybe.
01:13:59 So I've been trying to I tried to make them.
01:14:01 I substituted agar agar for gelatin.
01:14:05 And it works, but the consistency is completely different.
01:14:10 And it's not bad, but it's not a gummy.
01:14:14 So is it like not elastic?
01:14:17 Yes, it's not elastic.
01:14:19 It's it's just so soft.
01:14:20 It's a very well, I would say it's stiffened.
01:14:22 It's stiffened brittle.
01:14:24 It's a stiff if it's a stiff, brittle sort of gel.
01:14:28 And so I read about
01:14:32 Xanthan gum can can help make it more elastic.
01:14:35 So I tried adding some Xanthan gum and didn't didn't really like how it came out.
01:14:41 There's another thing called locust bean gum, which I know I have it somewhere,
01:14:45 but I can't fucking find my little tub of locust bean gum.
01:14:50 That sounds disgusting.
01:14:53 Well, yeah, but I mean like little beans that locusts
01:14:57 build in their little factory.
01:14:59 Well, I think it's a bean that maybe locusts eat them.
01:15:04 Oh, you know, it's just it's it's the gum.
01:15:06 It's it's the gum from some vegetable bean, much like much like Xanthan gum, I think.
01:15:13 So yeah, it's not.
01:15:14 It doesn't actually have anything to do with locusts.
01:15:17 But I just I know I lost it.
01:15:22 I lost it.
01:15:24 Maybe they ate it.
01:15:27 Oh, I mean, we had an inspector come into my house and inspect the place.
01:15:31 And apparently there are that I haven't seen the rat in a while.
01:15:36 Also, there's a strange smell coming from the downstairs bathroom.
01:15:40 And my suspicion is that the rat has died and is rotting and emitting a miasma.
01:15:47 But none of us can find a corpse.
01:15:49 So we're all sort of unsure where it's like fell down.
01:15:54 The drain.
01:15:56 Gross.
01:15:57 I mean, that's that's a thing that can happen if you don't have the cover on the shower drain.
01:16:04 Ew, maybe I'll check that.
01:16:08 Maybe I'll check to see if that did happen.
01:16:09 I think there's a cover on the shower drain, but I don't know.
01:16:13 I don't use the downstairs bathroom.
01:16:14 So maybe that's worth investigating.
01:16:19 Anyway, it's really gross.
01:16:20 An inspector came in, changed all the changed all the fire detectors.
01:16:25 And now and now the fire detector on the first floor works, which is nice.
01:16:30 But it goes off when I cook pizza in the oven.
01:16:33 So that's bad.
01:16:35 Hmm. Yeah, it's sad and makes me mad and upset.
01:16:40 And also, I guess they found rat droppings around, which I don't know where they found those.
01:16:43 I have not seen any rat droppings, and I do know what they look like.
01:16:47 So I don't know where he saw them, but his note said that, like, there were some around.
01:16:52 So that's too bad.
01:16:54 That's very unfortunate.
01:16:56 Should sweep the floor.
01:16:57 The floor. Nobody has, like, swept the downstairs in a while.
01:17:00 You should just do that.
01:17:02 Be so easy and everyone would love me.
01:17:05 Did I complain that I had to buy that I bought a huge, a huge box of toilet paper?
01:17:10 You did last time.
01:17:11 Nobody else buys a toilet paper.
01:17:12 It's all on me.
01:17:14 What would they do without me?
01:17:15 They would die.
01:17:16 They would have to get out without you smell bad.
01:17:18 It would smell even worse than they smell now and they would die.
01:17:21 Are you like in a townhouse kind of thing?
01:17:24 Or like a. Yeah, I'm like splitting.
01:17:26 I'm like splitting a condo with like five people.
01:17:30 Oh, OK.
01:17:32 So there's no, like, maintenance fellow who comes to clean.
01:17:36 It's up to the tenants.
01:17:39 No, there is no. There's no.
01:17:42 Damn. Damn, that would be fancy.
01:17:45 That would be fancy if we had a guy that came to clean the house.
01:17:48 That's what we got for like what for you or whatever.
01:17:52 Well, that's awesome. I'm jealous.
01:17:56 Somebody just has to sweep the kitchen.
01:17:58 Somebody just has to like sweep the kitchen in the front hallway.
01:18:00 It's not even that that much work.
01:18:01 I just wanted I've been meaning to just do it.
01:18:04 You should you should live stream yourself sweeping,
01:18:08 turning into content.
01:18:09 I need I need we need to change.
01:18:11 We need to change internet providers so that our
01:18:14 my stream will not cut out.
01:18:17 Fuck.
01:18:19 That would be a really funny reason,
01:18:21 like why nobody sweeps.
01:18:22 It's like, yeah, I mean, I would sweep, but I can't stream it.
01:18:26 Yeah. Oh, man.
01:18:30 Another. Did I tell you that I've sent?
01:18:32 Mention that like the boyfriend of the girl that lives here
01:18:37 said that like he wants.
01:18:38 Well, no, one of my roommates told me that he wants to start a podcast.
01:18:43 And another one told me that he wants to start streaming
01:18:45 himself playing like Magic the Gathering, because I guess he
01:18:49 he claims to be quite skilled at Magic the Gathering.
01:18:53 And I'm like, I can't I can't let these people know that I'm a podcaster.
01:18:58 Right. I've revealed I've revealed too much.
01:19:00 I've revealed too much by even mentioning to any of them that I like
01:19:04 do stuff on YouTube.
01:19:05 Like, I wish I I wish I didn't say that.
01:19:09 They'd be like, Ben, could you could you help me with my setup?
01:19:12 Because, you know, you you know about that stuff, right?
01:19:15 You're like, you're like a tech guy.
01:19:17 Never. Never. You're like a YouTube guy.
01:19:19 You could figure it out for me.
01:19:20 I do labor for free.
01:19:22 I wouldn't that would that would be bad.
01:19:25 That would be bad if they wanted me to like help with their setup.
01:19:29 It would be even worse if they wanted to like.
01:19:34 Collaborate or something.
01:19:36 Can you imagine?
01:19:37 Can you imagine if they want to like, hey,
01:19:40 let me shout out shout out my shout out my Magic the Gathering based
01:19:46 Twitch, Twitch channel, please.
01:19:50 Oh, dear.
01:19:52 You know, I'm just I'm just catastrophizing.
01:19:54 I'm just imagining the worst possible scenario.
01:19:59 Nobody nobody can know nobody can know that I'm a podcaster.
01:20:03 I didn't mention you should you should sweep.
01:20:05 I didn't mention it to that cousin who was asking about YouTube ad revenue.
01:20:09 You should sweep the floor so that they think you're a janitor instead.
01:20:14 Yeah, I'll tell them I quit.
01:20:17 I'll tell them I quit the posting life and decided to.
01:20:21 Return to the earth.
01:20:23 You know, you know, something that irritated me,
01:20:27 something that made me mad about my dinner with Andre was how shit it was.
01:20:32 But also is that the guy Wallace Shawn,
01:20:37 he's complaining about how poor he is.
01:20:39 He's complaining about like, business is not good.
01:20:42 I don't get any work.
01:20:44 I'm a failed playwright and then and his his.
01:20:50 The like the examples that they give for how how poor and and and unsuccessful
01:20:55 he is is that his girlfriend has to work three nights a week.
01:21:00 Like she doesn't even she doesn't even have a full time job.
01:21:02 She has a part time job.
01:21:03 Wow. Yeah.
01:21:05 It's like most nowadays, most people just it's most people,
01:21:10 just men and women, both partners just have a job.
01:21:12 You just everyone has a job, right?
01:21:15 Is this the 80s movie?
01:21:18 Hmm, 70s or 80s?
01:21:21 I'm so poor.
01:21:22 I had to sell one of my 70 yachts.
01:21:26 I'm so I'm so poor.
01:21:28 I'm so poor.
01:21:29 My girlfriend has to work.
01:21:30 My girlfriend works a part time job.
01:21:32 Oh, whoa, is me.
01:21:33 Oh, I'm so poor.
01:21:34 I usually don't go to this like extravagantly fancy restaurant,
01:21:38 but like, it's fine.
01:21:39 I will do that and I can afford it.
01:21:42 It's OK, 1981.
01:21:44 All right.
01:21:50 There's more.
01:21:51 There's more that I could say about that.
01:21:53 There's more like weird little things in there that just hint at like.
01:21:58 Just the the the the the economic differences in the economies of then versus now.
01:22:04 Yeah, ways that like.
01:22:07 Think things that he thinks that.
01:22:10 The way that you all is Sean is portrayed as like so poor in destitute.
01:22:14 He's so like so down in his luck, but like he, you know, he he splits like
01:22:19 he splits in New York.
01:22:20 He splits it like a Manhattan, New York apartment with his girlfriend,
01:22:24 who only works a part time job.
01:22:26 Like, my God, I live I live in a much cheaper area
01:22:30 and I split my house like seven ways.
01:22:34 Like, dude.
01:22:37 Dude, it's you know, it reminds me of like Homer Simpson,
01:22:41 how like home the Simpsons are sort of like poor.
01:22:43 They're down in their luck.
01:22:45 They're they've got a giant house.
01:22:47 They're a blue collar family, but they own a house.
01:22:49 They have two cars that yeah, the mom doesn't work, etc.
01:22:53 It's a hold over from an age when
01:22:56 it was normal to have like a big old thing like that.
01:23:00 It was it wasn't like that extravagant, actually.
01:23:03 I know cringe, cringe.
01:23:08 Those are the days.
01:23:09 Do you think they're going to I'm pretty sure they will.
01:23:12 But like the Simpsons doing like the
01:23:14 constantly breaking the timeline stuff with like
01:23:18 a new episode about Homer and Marge in the past of the 90s.
01:23:22 Yeah, and then an episode of them of the past in the 2000s.
01:23:29 Yeah, actually, they're going to have been zoomers this whole time.
01:23:33 I mean, I hope the show doesn't continue that long.
01:23:37 It will continue until 100 seasons.
01:23:40 I kind of hope that it ends soon.
01:23:44 I mean, I have heard people say that it is not as bad now as it was for a while,
01:23:50 that it has sort of like embrace its.
01:23:54 It's it's what it is as like new Simpsons and it's more trying to be its own
01:23:58 modern thing instead of sort of.
01:24:02 Aping its former self and that that's been good for it, I guess, I don't know.
01:24:07 It's still it's you know, it's cringe to see it continue on.
01:24:12 But it's already like they already had the Elon Musk is the greatest
01:24:15 inventor of modern times episode.
01:24:17 So like they've already got shamed themselves as much as they possibly can.
01:24:23 So there's no lower they can go.
01:24:25 They can only go up from here.
01:24:27 At this point, I don't even really think of it as like a show you can watch.
01:24:30 It's just sort of like.
01:24:33 How can something go on for this long?
01:24:36 Like, how is it continually getting greenlit for a new season?
01:24:41 Like, obviously, it's a giant thing, but like it's so insane.
01:24:45 Because people still watch it.
01:24:46 I mean, not as many people.
01:24:49 I just imagine the voice actors who have to.
01:24:54 Do this one role and get paid extremely well for it, but only have this one thing to do.
01:25:02 I mean, in the case of some of them like damaging their voice permanently in the process,
01:25:07 like, do they are they very tired of it?
01:25:11 I'm sure they rather do another thing.
01:25:15 I know.
01:25:16 I'm going to say no, like, because it's like you said, I'm sure it's like
01:25:20 it's what they're known for.
01:25:22 It's a very high profile role and I'm sure they get paid extremely well for it.
01:25:27 And I mean, not saying that like voice acting is like not, you know, hard work in its own right,
01:25:33 but like it's easier.
01:25:35 I'm sure it's I'm sure, you know, recording lines for a 30 minute
01:25:39 show is a lot easier than than the other jobs out there, even in entertainment.
01:25:45 So I'm sure it's a very, very pretty, pretty cushy, pretty cushy position.
01:25:51 That's probably why they've all been doing it for 35 years.
01:25:54 Mega Man just turned 35.
01:25:58 Yesterday was the anniversary.
01:25:59 Wow. Oh, I saw the 17th about that.
01:26:02 He's an old man.
01:26:03 What did Capcom do to celebrate?
01:26:06 I don't know what they did, but apparently there were no major like game
01:26:10 announcements, which is which is too bad.
01:26:14 That's that's that's unfortunate.
01:26:15 But I think no one was really expecting one.
01:26:18 So. Eh, nothing.
01:26:21 Mega Man, 35th, maybe like Kotaku has like an article summarizing.
01:26:28 Oh, here's one that says New Mega Man could be revealed for 35th anniversary.
01:26:32 Yeah, I guess a lot of things could happen.
01:26:34 That's not news.
01:26:35 That's not news.
01:26:37 It's not news.
01:26:38 Wouldn't it be so fucked up if there was something to talk about today on the news?
01:26:43 That'd be so fucked up.
01:26:45 Let's talk about that.
01:26:47 I don't really see any major announcements.
01:26:52 I feel like there would be like.
01:26:55 Higher search results, if there was anything noteworthy.
01:27:00 I didn't I wasn't really paying that close attention.
01:27:02 I figured I would hear about it if there was anything big.
01:27:05 And they should do they should do their own like Smash Brothers universe,
01:27:12 but just for Mega Man so that all the Mega Man characters can interact.
01:27:17 It's a little little like crossover game.
01:27:19 Like Power Rangers, every Red Ranger from every iteration of Power Rangers
01:27:23 gets together for a special episode, but it's Mega Man instead.
01:27:30 I mean, they had.
01:27:32 Well, they had Mega Man, the power battle and Mega Man to the power fighters,
01:27:36 which were like fighting games where your Mega Man against the robot masters.
01:27:43 I mean, yeah, there's enough.
01:27:45 There's enough robot masters that they probably could do that for sure.
01:27:49 Are there any games where you can play as those guys?
01:27:52 Um, well, I think in I think in like one of the remakes,
01:27:58 like in Mega Man, powered up, I think you could play as some of the robot masters.
01:28:05 Um, try to think.
01:28:10 There should be a school like a high school anime
01:28:15 visual novel with all the Mega Man.
01:28:18 I don't, you know, I wonder if they're I wonder if the mangas and stuff
01:28:21 like go more into like what does what does Rock do when he's not Mega Man?
01:28:26 Like, does he go to school?
01:28:27 Like, does he does he like blend in with society?
01:28:30 Like, does he go shopping?
01:28:32 Is he friends with Shinji?
01:28:34 Shinji from Everingale?
01:28:35 Is he friends with Shinji? Yeah.
01:28:37 Yeah, he probably he probably would be now that you mentioned it.
01:28:43 They're just doing like the the dejected like hanged heads.
01:28:47 Like pose, but together.
01:28:51 I don't know why that's so funny.
01:28:54 But but you know, they kind of hint in the games, they kind of hint at like,
01:29:00 oh, yeah, when when he's not when he's not Mega Man, he's like Rock.
01:29:06 And like as Rock, maybe he's just a normal kid.
01:29:09 Does he just does he live a normal kid life?
01:29:12 Like, does he have friends?
01:29:13 Like, what's what's the deal?
01:29:15 What game does he play?
01:29:17 Yeah. And do you want that?
01:29:19 Just read Astro Boy, because that's what that is.
01:29:22 I know. True.
01:29:24 I know. It's I've read a few.
01:29:25 Mega Man literally just is they made Astro Boy again, but they made it a video game this time.
01:29:30 Yeah, I need to read more Astro Boys.
01:29:34 I tried to read all of them and I got like to the beginning.
01:29:37 There's a few like little short stories.
01:29:41 They're like, they're so odd.
01:29:44 I would like to be fun to read some old Tezuka stuff.
01:29:48 I've like never read any of it.
01:29:51 It's really good. Blackjack, I highly recommend.
01:29:54 It's like a like a medical drama, I guess.
01:29:59 Yeah, I've seen your house.
01:30:01 Exactly. I've seen the Blackjack movie.
01:30:05 And it was OK.
01:30:08 Yeah.
01:30:10 Well, Blackjack is kind of like, isn't he kind of like an evil dude?
01:30:16 He's sort of, I guess it's like a.
01:30:22 I wouldn't say anti hero.
01:30:23 Yeah, anti hero.
01:30:24 Like he goes by his own rules.
01:30:27 He's a unlicensed, a renegade and unlicensed doctor who charges insane amounts.
01:30:32 But, you know, you know, it's what he's doing.
01:30:35 He does.
01:30:37 Like, oh, you got an uncurable disease.
01:30:39 I have this experimental new technique using shuriken.
01:30:43 I can throw them into your heart and they can fix everything.
01:30:47 Nice. You have to trust me.
01:30:49 No, no, thanks.
01:30:52 Well, it looks like you're going to die from heart death or whatever you got.
01:30:56 Damn it. Yeah.
01:30:58 Fuck.
01:31:00 I was getting off his back.
01:31:01 He's got other patients.
01:31:03 Got other fish to fry.
01:31:05 And they got money.
01:31:06 You got money to pay.
01:31:07 Yeah, you don't get the you can't pay the bills.
01:31:10 Then you then you then you keep then you retain your ills.
01:31:14 That's that's what I always say.
01:31:27 Did he do Usagi, Yajimbo, or is that someone else?
01:31:30 That's someone else.
01:31:31 That's like a I don't know if it's American, but it's.
01:31:37 Somewhere it's somewhere somehow related to TMNT around that same time.
01:31:44 Really? They cross over a lot.
01:31:46 What? Yeah, I think it's like Usagi,
01:31:49 Yajimbo is like from the early days of free comics.
01:31:54 That just happened to get a bit popular.
01:31:57 But is it? Wait, is it not Japanese?
01:32:02 Japanese born American.
01:32:05 Oh, OK.
01:32:05 Stan, Stan Sakai, yeah, that's a guy.
01:32:12 Oh, this looks cool.
01:32:12 I haven't seen this before.
01:32:15 OK, this is not I thought it was older.
01:32:17 I was older than that.
01:32:19 Maybe I'm you know, am I confusing it with is it like Wolf and Pup?
01:32:23 Yeah, that's another old one.
01:32:25 It's not Tezuka, but it's another like classical manga.
01:32:30 What's that one about the like set?
01:32:34 He's like a Ronin or he's like he's like a samurai,
01:32:37 but it's not like a battle manga.
01:32:38 It's just about like a samurai like hanging out at his house
01:32:43 and like cheating on his wife and ignoring his kids.
01:32:48 Is that Ring of Bell?
01:32:49 I don't know this one.
01:32:52 Oh, man, where did I hear about this one?
01:32:55 Someone was talking about it and some.
01:32:58 Oh, it's an old manga about a samurai
01:33:05 cheating on his wife.
01:33:08 Is it Hagure Gumo?
01:33:11 Yes, this is it.
01:33:13 Yes, this is it.
01:33:14 Hagure Gumo is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by George Akiyama.
01:33:20 Hagure Gumo literally vagrant cloud is a Japanese manga, blah, blah, blah, blah.
01:33:25 Set at the end of the Edo period,
01:33:28 it depicts clouds, clouds family with his wife, Turtle,
01:33:32 their 11 year old son and eight year old daughter with his wife's name is Turtle.
01:33:37 The clouds are always ignoring work and playing.
01:33:39 Cloud is notorious for womanizing.
01:33:41 OK, and that's the plot.
01:33:44 Is this an old series or is this a new thing?
01:33:47 It is from it's.
01:33:49 Oh, my God, it ran from 1973 all the way
01:33:53 for to 2017. Are you joking?
01:33:56 Oh.
01:33:58 How did it how did it run for 46 years?
01:34:04 I guess he got around that samurai.
01:34:10 Here's what it looks like.
01:34:12 Someone in the comments, tell me where I heard about this.
01:34:15 His name is cloud, maybe from Final Fantasy Seven.
01:34:19 Yeah.
01:34:21 George Akiyama is the author.
01:34:24 Is that a normal, like George first name?
01:34:29 I think that maybe is a Beatles.
01:34:30 OK, his name is Joji, but I think that's like
01:34:34 it's Americanized as George.
01:34:37 Maybe he lived in America.
01:34:41 His father was Korean and an artificial flower craftsman.
01:34:45 Gay stupid.
01:34:50 You know, flowers already exist.
01:34:52 Hey, let me pick them.
01:34:53 You know what? Just pluck them.
01:34:54 If I, you know, you know what?
01:34:57 To continue, let me do some more toxic masculinity.
01:35:01 My I mentioned that the girl that lives here has this boyfriend.
01:35:05 She's this guy who's like always here and they always cook together.
01:35:09 And I got to say it's very effeminate.
01:35:12 It's a very effeminate thing that he has this girlfriend
01:35:15 and that he cooks dinner with her.
01:35:18 It's just not it's just it's just not it's just not manly.
01:35:22 Why depends on what they're cooking,
01:35:23 like if it's a big it's just a big beef stew as a man.
01:35:28 No, it's it's not it's not it's not manly.
01:35:31 So wrong. Is there anything wrong
01:35:33 with being an effeminate in the kitchen?
01:35:34 Absolutely everything.
01:35:37 No, I just I just seems seems like a big fucking waste of time.
01:35:41 It just seems like every time I see them,
01:35:43 they're always like cooking some shit in the kitchen.
01:35:44 And it's like how many fucking hours a day do you spend
01:35:47 preparing some nonsense, you idiots.
01:35:53 Just put ham on a wrap and roll it up and eat it and be done.
01:35:58 Be done with your with your garbage.
01:36:02 I don't know.
01:36:02 I think it's nice to be able to cook something.
01:36:05 I think, you know what, it's fine every now and then.
01:36:08 I don't know. I don't like I can't it just seems it just seems so tedious.
01:36:12 It just seems like they make it's like such a big production.
01:36:14 It's like that's what you spend your evening doing.
01:36:16 It's like preparing shopping for the ingredients to prepare this meal
01:36:20 and then preparing it and laying it all out meticulously
01:36:23 and doing all these intricate steps to do to in order for it to
01:36:26 and then you actually you just have to take the time to cook it.
01:36:29 And then, you know, you plate it out and you eat it afterwards.
01:36:32 And it's like that's your that's your evening.
01:36:34 That that sucks if you're by yourself.
01:36:36 But like if with two people, it takes not so long, I guess.
01:36:40 Oh, are you saying that it could be a fun
01:36:42 activity to spend with someone you love?
01:36:44 Yeah, that's what I'm effeminate.
01:36:46 That's what I mean. That's what I'm saying.
01:36:49 You would say that, wouldn't you?
01:36:51 Yeah.
01:36:53 Sounds great.
01:36:54 I like I'm going to keep shaming him for it.
01:36:59 I'll never stop.
01:37:05 You should be like me and make a pass at Turkish girls on the bus
01:37:10 and get laughed at and kicked off the much manly.
01:37:15 And now I don't have to waste my time cooking.
01:37:17 Now I can just eat ham wraps and it's no problem.
01:37:23 I'm I'm I'm I'm a man in the kitchen.
01:37:26 I'm manly in the kitchen.
01:37:27 I just mix my ingredients together.
01:37:29 I add some Xanthan gum, add some Xanthan gum
01:37:33 to my to my agar agar solution.
01:37:36 And then I taste it and I say, you gross.
01:37:38 It has a consistency of snot and boogers.
01:37:42 And then I throw it away.
01:37:43 And that's and that's and then it's done.
01:37:46 You know what? It's not a big deal.
01:37:47 It's not a big fucking federal issue.
01:37:53 Oh, I just pulled a leg muscle.
01:37:57 This is the new podcast talking point, everybody.
01:38:00 Oh, no, which muscle was it the hamstring?
01:38:06 Well, it's the one
01:38:09 that goes under the knee and on the inside of the leg.
01:38:13 Oh, I don't like that.
01:38:14 It like sticks out.
01:38:16 It's in a vulnerable position today.
01:38:19 It's like it's under the knee and then up on the inner thigh area.
01:38:23 It's sort of.
01:38:23 Are you talking about the vastus medialis?
01:38:26 Oh, that's the one.
01:38:28 I don't know the names of the muscles.
01:38:30 You know what? My, you know what?
01:38:32 This is a perfect time for me to mention my favorite leg muscle,
01:38:36 the sartorius.
01:38:38 Artorius of the abyss.
01:38:40 Yes, the sartorius of the abyss.
01:38:44 I'll show you.
01:38:46 I'll show you.
01:38:47 It's I'll highlight it in red.
01:38:49 It's it's this one.
01:38:51 No, don't show me your muscles, Ben.
01:38:54 It's this one right here.
01:38:59 Is that the one that could be it?
01:39:01 You say that one's your favorite.
01:39:03 That's my favorite.
01:39:05 Just because of what it does for you.
01:39:07 No, I just think it looks cool.
01:39:10 I'll stretch over like that.
01:39:12 I have no idea.
01:39:13 Yeah, how it how it just kind of like crosses over
01:39:16 the over on top of the other ones.
01:39:19 Looks pretty fruity to me.
01:39:20 Fruity looks effeminate.
01:39:22 Yeah. No, no.
01:39:28 Need a perfectly cute muscle.
01:39:30 That's the man I am.
01:39:32 I don't know why. You know what?
01:39:33 I'm just going to write.
01:39:33 I'm just going to write.
01:39:34 I'm just going to write.
01:39:35 I'm just going to cope.
01:39:36 I'm like I'm like I'm like the ugly.
01:39:38 I'm like the ugliest, soyest, most beta male in my entire family.
01:39:42 It's very sad. It makes me sad.
01:39:44 It bums me out.
01:39:45 I'm the shortest.
01:39:47 I'm the shortest male of the.
01:39:49 I'm the shortest male son of the shortest male
01:39:54 uncle in the in the whole group.
01:39:57 Everybody else is taller than me.
01:39:59 And also just just just tougher looking.
01:40:04 Just tougher. They got better chins.
01:40:08 Even the women even the women are taller than me.
01:40:10 What do I do? Help.
01:40:13 That's always good when a woman is taller.
01:40:15 Yeah, that's not a problem.
01:40:16 Stupid, stupid.
01:40:21 This is not my this is not my dad's side.
01:40:23 All my all my all my cousins on my dad's side are like tall.
01:40:26 Sucks. I don't like him.
01:40:30 And then they also and also their landlords.
01:40:34 Well, that's.
01:40:37 You know, if you take estrogen,
01:40:39 you'll get even shorter.
01:40:40 I don't think that's true.
01:40:42 It is. I've lost.
01:40:44 I've lost half an inch since I started like two years ago.
01:40:47 How?
01:40:49 Because your bones, they they they get like weaker.
01:40:53 I think I talked about this already,
01:40:54 maybe not on the progress news podcast.
01:40:58 But the effects of estrogen on the bones
01:41:01 is that they become less strong and they shrink a tiny bit.
01:41:06 Sounds over the course of your whole skeleton.
01:41:08 You get a little shorter.
01:41:09 Sounds awesome.
01:41:10 So what you need to do is you need to chug testosterone.
01:41:13 You need to get as much of that as you possibly can
01:41:17 and just chug it to a dangerous amount.
01:41:19 I guess that makes a lot of sense when you put it like that.
01:41:22 That probably is what I should do.
01:41:23 Yeah. Yeah.
01:41:30 I don't know.
01:41:31 You know, I'm just it's just beta.
01:41:32 It's just very effeminate of me.
01:41:34 And I just think that it's lame.
01:41:38 It's nothing wrong with being beta.
01:41:41 Nothing wrong with being a little effeminate soy boy.
01:41:43 I'm so I'm a little effeminate soy boy.
01:41:47 And that's it.
01:41:51 That's it.
01:41:51 Nothing wrong with being a tiny, cutesy.
01:41:53 I'm just a loser.
01:41:53 I'm just a big loser and everyone hates me.
01:41:56 No. Yeah. Yeah.
01:41:58 No, fake, false.
01:42:00 I don't hate you. Yes, you do.
01:42:01 Stupid.
01:42:04 Prove it.
01:42:04 Prove how I hate you.
01:42:05 I.
01:42:07 Fuck.
01:42:09 I'm sure I'm sure there's a way.
01:42:12 Deadly. Come on.
01:42:12 Tell me you hate me.
01:42:14 I could tell me I'm tell me I'm a little soy boy.
01:42:16 But it's it's spent on me.
01:42:19 If that's what you are, then I'm even worse.
01:42:21 If that's I know you.
01:42:22 I know you are.
01:42:23 But what am I?
01:42:26 Better. OK.
01:42:28 Yeah.
01:42:29 Daily affirmations.
01:42:31 Um, I just, um,
01:42:33 you're short king, Ben.
01:42:35 Embrace it.
01:42:37 I'm not even that short.
01:42:39 I'm not even that shorter than you.
01:42:40 You are shorter than me.
01:42:42 I'm like, yeah, I'm like, I'm like pretty average.
01:42:44 I'm like, maybe just slightly shy of the average height
01:42:47 of the American male.
01:42:50 And yet.
01:42:51 I don't know, it's just it's just weird.
01:42:53 Like everybody, all my all my cousins are like,
01:42:55 all my cousins are like six foot two.
01:42:57 It's really weird.
01:42:59 I mean, my cousins are giants.
01:43:02 Is that true?
01:43:03 Yeah. Well, at least on the one side where my my uncle was
01:43:10 like a big guy.
01:43:11 He's a person now, but like, um, his sons are really,
01:43:16 really tall, really big people.
01:43:19 And I'm like, well, you know, I was small back then.
01:43:24 I'm smaller now.
01:43:26 And they were older.
01:43:27 So I always thought it was like, oh, older people.
01:43:30 Oh, they're just yeah, you know, they're older than me.
01:43:33 So they're bigger.
01:43:33 But no, it turns out that's just how people are just bigger.
01:43:38 Yeah.
01:43:40 Um, I mean, do you feel like they look down on you like
01:43:45 literally and and metaphorically?
01:43:48 Um, I don't know.
01:43:50 Some sometimes I get the feeling, but it's sometimes I get
01:43:54 that feeling, but I think it's a me thing.
01:43:56 I think I don't think I don't think actually anyone actually.
01:43:58 And it's not just it's not just that.
01:44:00 It's not like, uh, uh, that like they're big or like better
01:44:06 looking than me, although they are.
01:44:08 But it's also it's also like, you know, they have real jobs
01:44:12 and you know, own homes, are married, have kids, etc. etc.
01:44:16 Yeah, that's that's just normal.
01:44:18 Like I know it's normal.
01:44:20 Like, uh, societal pressures.
01:44:23 I know it's it's if you don't fit the mold that is set out for
01:44:28 you to be like, this is how you do normal stuff for normal
01:44:32 people. And you're like, ew, no, I don't want to do that.
01:44:34 And then you end up on a divergent path.
01:44:36 You're going to get pressured just by seeing other people
01:44:40 doing the normal thing.
01:44:41 I don't even I couldn't do that.
01:44:43 I like I don't even really think that anyone is like, oh,
01:44:46 Ben is such a is such a such a black sheep, such a such a
01:44:49 fail son.
01:44:50 I like I don't actually think anyone really even cares or
01:44:53 thinks thinks about it like that.
01:44:56 But I do get a little bit like everyone else like owns a
01:45:02 house.
01:45:03 God, I mean, that's fair to be upset about.
01:45:06 It sucks that owning a house is not easy.
01:45:10 Right.
01:45:12 Well, you know, I'm just griping.
01:45:15 There's only one thing to do.
01:45:17 Buy a house.
01:45:18 Build a house.
01:45:19 Build a house.
01:45:21 Yeah, build a build a bear.
01:45:23 That's the other thing you could do.
01:45:25 That's sure to help.
01:45:26 You could build a bear.
01:45:27 I could build that.
01:45:29 That would that would solve all my issue.
01:45:31 That damn it.
01:45:33 Genius.
01:45:34 Okay.
01:45:34 It's like, hmm, which way?
01:45:36 Miss Western man, build a bear or build a house?
01:45:38 Buy a house or build a bear.
01:45:45 Well, I've made I've made my choice.
01:45:47 I have so many bears, I can build a house with them.
01:45:58 Conquers the world, chief.
01:46:00 Just hit, hit, hit, cacking.
01:46:08 I don't know.
01:46:08 Somebody else say something.
01:46:10 Fuck you.
01:46:13 Well, I mean, I don't really have anything else.
01:46:18 That happened other than like kind of a bummer that I'm like,
01:46:23 I'm running low on some HRT medication.
01:46:27 And I'm like, okay, I got a restock.
01:46:28 Got to get like another like 17 months worth of pills or whatever.
01:46:32 But the site I used last time has been destroyed,
01:46:35 been found and like just like they got them.
01:46:37 They got them.
01:46:38 They just they shut them down.
01:46:40 Who did?
01:46:41 I don't know.
01:46:42 Just like the government's the police.
01:46:46 It's just sort of a thing.
01:46:48 It's not illegal to like buy medication from abroad,
01:46:54 at least in the UK for estrogen and stuff.
01:46:57 You can buy it.
01:46:58 It's you could have it.
01:47:00 You just can't buy it from British pharmacies
01:47:04 because you need a prescription.
01:47:05 And getting a prescription is like years long, decades long,
01:47:09 like evil system that is designed to make you die
01:47:13 and kill yourself before they give you any help.
01:47:16 I see.
01:47:17 So obviously I'm doing it by myself.
01:47:19 I'm buying the medication.
01:47:21 But the websites you buy it from,
01:47:25 they get shut down like quite frequently.
01:47:27 And I don't know where to get them right now.
01:47:28 And I found this new site and I tried to buy some stuff and it,
01:47:33 the money didn't go through.
01:47:35 Like my money wasn't left.
01:47:37 It wasn't taken from my account.
01:47:40 So it's not like I was scammed.
01:47:41 It's just something that's going wrong.
01:47:43 I have to call them up.
01:47:44 And it's just, it's just a little annoying.
01:47:48 It's anxiety inducing, I guess is the way to put it.
01:47:54 It's just sort of like, ah, fuck.
01:47:56 You know, the longer this takes,
01:47:57 the longer it'll take to get here.
01:47:58 And I don't want to run out.
01:48:01 I don't want to not have the things.
01:48:02 Then I'll be off the stuff.
01:48:05 Then what if my body masculinizes?
01:48:08 Ah, it sucks.
01:48:10 I don't, I don't know.
01:48:12 Would that, would that happen?
01:48:16 To an extent, yeah.
01:48:17 I mean, if the estrogen in my body goes down over time
01:48:22 and it's not replaced,
01:48:23 then the testosterone will take more of an effect.
01:48:25 And like parts of, you know, body hair will come back,
01:48:29 facial hair will come back just a bit.
01:48:31 Well, I mean, where are other,
01:48:32 I mean, where are other UK based,
01:48:38 special people like yourself getting there?
01:48:41 I, I, it's one of those like,
01:48:45 thinking about it is very stressful.
01:48:47 So it won't take too long to figure it out.
01:48:50 It's just like, oh God, no, I don't want to think about that.
01:48:53 Oh, fuck.
01:48:54 I understand.
01:48:55 That's been, that's been a bit of a...
01:48:56 Someone at my door, I gotta be right back, sorry.
01:48:58 Okay.
01:49:01 Did he say someone that has no...
01:49:02 It's the hormone police.
01:49:04 It's the hormone police.
01:49:05 Good for them.
01:49:07 Good for them.
01:49:07 They're, they're, I'm glad they're working.
01:49:11 I mean, sure.
01:49:12 We can't just fire the hormone police
01:49:15 because then they would be out of a job.
01:49:17 Oh no.
01:49:18 I have to keep policing hormones for the economy.
01:49:23 You know what was really bugging me?
01:49:27 I mean, there's, it's, it's like nothing new.
01:49:30 It's just, there's lots of strikes happening right now.
01:49:34 And like lots of strikes in lots of different fields in the UK.
01:49:38 There's rails, worker strikes, there's ambulance strikes,
01:49:40 there's nurses strikes, there's postal worker strikes,
01:49:44 all of which are very important during the cold and Christmasy month.
01:49:50 Is there a reason they're all happening at the same time?
01:49:53 It's just because the, because of the Ukraine war, the price of living.
01:50:00 Because the, because the gas companies don't have like a cap on how much they can charge.
01:50:05 They're just charged as much as they fucking can.
01:50:09 People are getting to a point where they can't use their, their heating
01:50:16 and they can't like cook food really.
01:50:18 And they can't buy things.
01:50:19 They cut, they just have no money.
01:50:21 And the, the pay for all of these people all over the country has not risen to match it.
01:50:28 And so they're basically everybody all over the place.
01:50:32 It's just said, we can't afford to live anymore.
01:50:34 We literally can't afford to live.
01:50:36 We're all going on strike.
01:50:37 And I'm like, hell yes, please go on strike.
01:50:39 I see.
01:50:41 But then I see like politicians saying, don't they care about the,
01:50:46 the sanctity of Christmas?
01:50:47 Don't they care about like, yes, yes, Christmas pilled.
01:50:52 They're like, this is supposed to be a nice holiday and they're ruining it for everyone.
01:50:56 I'm like, the people who are negatively affected by, you know,
01:51:01 not having enough money are also not going to have a good Christmas.
01:51:05 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:51:06 Fuck you.
01:51:06 The people, they're not letting down the country by going on strike.
01:51:11 They are the country.
01:51:13 Right.
01:51:13 And you, yeah.
01:51:14 I mean, of course.
01:51:14 It's just so frustrating.
01:51:16 That sucks.
01:51:17 I mean, I think they kind of, I think we talked about, they kind of,
01:51:21 they kind of crushed that like rail workers strike in America.
01:51:25 Yeah.
01:51:25 They didn't, they didn't get what they, they didn't get the sick leave that they wanted,
01:51:29 which is pretty cringe.
01:51:33 There was something else I wanted to say.
01:51:35 Okay.
01:51:35 It's not quite the same, but that really reminds me of the Elon thing from this week.
01:51:41 Do you see the thing about like the tracking his jet?
01:51:44 Oh, yeah, yeah.
01:51:48 Deadly, are you, are you, are you following?
01:51:51 I'm back now.
01:51:51 Yeah.
01:51:52 Yeah, I saw your back.
01:51:53 Are you following Elon on Twitter?
01:51:55 Are you familiar with his?
01:51:56 I try not to.
01:51:58 Yeah.
01:51:58 It's just tiring.
01:52:00 It is, it's, it's tiring, but I mean, I don't follow his account.
01:52:05 Yeah.
01:52:06 But certain things that he's doing is like,
01:52:09 in like unbelievably like embarrassing for him, like it's so weird.
01:52:15 It's funny because it seems like it's so, like it's so embarrassing,
01:52:18 the hypocrisy is so naked.
01:52:20 And yet like the, the fact that like it continues and that like consequences are
01:52:24 not materializing for him is like so, it makes me really upset and it frustrates me
01:52:30 almost more than it amuses me.
01:52:32 Um, but, um, yeah, the, if he gets his comeuppance one day, then I'll look back on it very fondly,
01:52:40 but if he never does, then I will just have been infuriated for nothing.
01:52:45 But anyway, the thing this week where like, you know, he specifically said,
01:52:48 I won't ban the account that posts my jet, my jets, like, uh, location.
01:52:55 And then he did ban the account that posted the jets location.
01:52:59 And then he did.
01:53:00 And then he, and then he banned reporters who reported that he banned that account,
01:53:08 which again is only public posting public information.
01:53:12 And then the justification for this is first, he called them all doctors,
01:53:15 even the people that merely reported on the fact that he banned the account.
01:53:19 He called them all doctors because they were like referencing the fact that the account existed.
01:53:25 And, and then he, and then he, he said that he said that the account had to be banned
01:53:29 because like his kid was on, you know, it was assassination coordinates.
01:53:33 It was updating his location in real time and it's a safety issue and they're putting him
01:53:37 at risk and they're putting his family at risk.
01:53:38 And it's so amazingly, amazingly annoying.
01:53:43 I didn't really see that many people point out that like, if it's unsafe,
01:53:47 like it's not, it's not fair to be like, you know, you can't post my jets info
01:53:53 because that exposes my location.
01:53:56 And it's like, well, no, nobody else uses a private jet.
01:53:59 If you don't, it's public information where a jet is.
01:54:03 If you don't want your location publicly revealed, you could simply not fly on a public jet.
01:54:09 Like nobody's forced you to put your kid on the fucking jet and which supposedly endanger him.
01:54:13 Like you endangered him by putting him on a jet who's like,
01:54:16 if you think that's dangerous, that his location is known,
01:54:19 you're the one that made that information public by putting him on the fucking jet.
01:54:23 Man, it's multiple levels of like incompetence and misunderstanding of how anything works.
01:54:30 I think the reason, I don't know whether this is true,
01:54:34 but I get the feeling that the reason he suddenly started feeling scared for his life
01:54:38 because of the Elon jet and stuff is because he went on that Dave Chappelle show
01:54:43 and everyone booed him when he came on stage.
01:54:45 I'm honestly surprised that that happened.
01:54:47 I thought that I thought it was like Twitter that hates him.
01:54:50 I didn't realize that like the real people hate him.
01:54:53 I kind of thought the real people are just like neutral on him
01:54:56 or think that he's cool because he was on the Simpsons.
01:54:57 I mean, he's done so many like very publicly weird stupid things
01:55:03 during the whole getting of Twitter.
01:55:05 Yeah, but like I kind of thought that was like only Twitter people would care about that.
01:55:09 I didn't think that like the average person would give a shit,
01:55:12 but like, oh, he charged eight dollars for Twitter blue or something, right?
01:55:19 I just kind of thought that wouldn't matter to like the average Dave Chappelle audience member.
01:55:24 I suppose it is a bit weird.
01:55:27 I feel like it's just because Twitter is so like linked with normal people
01:55:34 as well as Twitter weirdos that anything that blows up on Twitter,
01:55:39 especially with somebody who's so high profile that he bought,
01:55:42 you know, he's in charge of the entire site.
01:55:45 Like a lot more normal people are being exposed to the funny things that he's doing
01:55:49 and the embarrassing things that he's doing to make more people just find it like through
01:55:56 journalism or otherwise.
01:55:58 I don't think the average person is like a regular Twitter user though.
01:56:03 No, but like that's it's big news, right?
01:56:06 BBC reports on Elon Musk's Twitter bullshit quite often.
01:56:10 I see. I wonder if like, I wonder if like sometimes I'll go to my parents' house and
01:56:17 they'll be watching like Colbert.
01:56:20 Is it the late show with Colbert?
01:56:24 I know he doesn't do the Colbert report anymore.
01:56:28 Whatever.
01:56:28 The Colbert report?
01:56:30 Are you not familiar with the Colbert report?
01:56:32 I thought it was the Colbert report.
01:56:34 You, well, you've clearly never seen it then because no, it's the Colbert report.
01:56:39 I mean, you know what it was, right?
01:56:40 I thought it was the reports though, like the Colbert report.
01:56:43 I mean, yes, it's spelled that way, but just like the T in Colbert is silent,
01:56:48 they pronounce the, they pronounce the report silently as well.
01:56:53 But there's a word called report, like, and it's spelled different.
01:56:58 Yes.
01:57:01 Look, look, I don't know what to tell you that they, they pronounced it the Colbert report.
01:57:07 And you know, you know that the shtick of it was that he basically like,
01:57:10 he was, he was basically like a satire of a right wing pundit, right?
01:57:15 Vaguely, yes.
01:57:16 Well, now, well, now he is no longer a satire.
01:57:18 Now he's just a, now he's just a, just a lib.
01:57:22 He's just a lib.
01:57:24 But sometimes I'll see, I'll see my parents watching Colbert report and he'll say like,
01:57:30 and he'll, you know, and he'll repeat back to me my, my DNC approved, you know, my liberal
01:57:34 opinions, my, my, my safe, my safe Democrat communist opinions that have been filtered
01:57:41 through, you know, global homo and fed back to me by George Soros.
01:57:45 He'll say NFTs bad.
01:57:47 He'll say, you know, Russia bad.
01:57:50 He'll say, you know, transphobia bad.
01:57:54 And I'll say, and I'll say, yes, I love, I love it when I'm told what to think by the establishment.
01:58:05 And then I'll, and then I'll take one microchip out of my NPC head and I'll put a new microchip
01:58:09 into my NPC head and the cycle continues.
01:58:14 And I'm glad my parents are getting their microchips from the right guys.
01:58:18 What is what is the point that I'm trying to make?
01:58:23 Okay.
01:58:26 Deadly comics, what is your extreme political opinions?
01:58:29 Yeah, what's your, I got so many.
01:58:31 What's your most cancelable?
01:58:33 What's your most cancel?
01:58:34 What's your most cancelable opinion about trans people?
01:58:40 It should be given.
01:58:44 All gun rights revoked except the trans people.
01:58:47 Okay.
01:58:47 Oh, hell yeah.
01:58:48 All right.
01:58:48 Okay.
01:58:49 You know what?
01:58:49 All right.
01:58:50 That's pretty good.
01:58:50 That's pretty good.
01:58:52 Guns are great.
01:58:54 Only in the right hands.
01:58:56 Gun girl.
01:58:59 Gun girl.
01:59:00 Um, okay.
01:59:02 Good answer.
01:59:04 Go on.
01:59:05 Tell me more.
01:59:06 Oh no.
01:59:08 More, more takes, more takes.
01:59:11 Who should be assassinated next?
01:59:15 Let's see.
01:59:17 I mean, there's so many.
01:59:19 I know.
01:59:19 It's a smorgasbord.
01:59:21 Acornicopia.
01:59:23 Yeah.
01:59:27 Man.
01:59:28 I'll give you a hint.
01:59:30 It's um.
01:59:33 It's been saying.
01:59:34 I don't know.
01:59:34 I actually have no idea.
01:59:36 What does.
01:59:37 There's no, there's no wrong answers really.
01:59:39 When does murder become assassination?
01:59:41 It has to be a public figure, right?
01:59:44 Is that, is that the definition?
01:59:47 I don't know.
01:59:48 That's what it seems like.
01:59:49 Like if you can't assassinate your roommate,
01:59:51 if no one knows who your roommate is.
01:59:54 I, hmm, that's a, you know, this is a question.
01:59:56 This is a, I've always thought of assassination.
02:00:00 Yes, as a public figure thing, but also as like premeditated to an extent that
02:00:07 it's, it's for a specific like end rather than an emotional like I need this person dead.
02:00:15 Okay.
02:00:15 Well, according to.
02:00:16 Like if you're, if you're just mad at someone and you kill them, that's murder.
02:00:19 But if you have a political agenda and you need somebody dead, that's assassination.
02:00:25 Okay.
02:00:25 But assess like celebrities can be assassinated to even if it's not political.
02:00:31 Do you think I would, I would call like the Jung Lenin shooting a murder though.
02:00:37 Well, apparently according to dictionary.com assassination is murder,
02:00:43 murder of an important person in a surprise attack for political or religious reasons.
02:00:50 Okay.
02:00:51 Wikipedia says it is the murder of a prominent or important person.
02:00:55 Uh, well, that's it.
02:00:57 That's all Wikipedia says.
02:00:58 So Wikipedia doesn't even stipulate that it has to be like a surprise attack or for.
02:01:03 I always think of an assassination as a, as a ninja coming in.
02:01:08 Ninja coming in your room with a little, with a small katana.
02:01:12 I forget what they're called.
02:01:14 And then go.
02:01:15 A Waki Zashi.
02:01:17 Waki Zashi and they go on your neck.
02:01:19 That's an assassination.
02:01:21 That is, that should be the definition.
02:01:23 That's a textbook assassination for sure.
02:01:26 Premeditated act of assassination.
02:01:29 Premeditated act of killing someone suddenly or secretively, especially a prominent person.
02:01:34 Okay.
02:01:34 Some of these definitions emphasize the secretiveness of the killing.
02:01:38 Some of them emphasize the prominence of the victim.
02:01:41 Some of them emphasize the, the political or religious like significance of the act itself.
02:01:47 I think JFK was assassinated and John Lennon was murdered.
02:01:52 Seems right.
02:01:53 For some reason.
02:01:56 Because John Lennon's killer was like just a weirdo.
02:01:58 I mean, I, I could say, I could say.
02:02:00 I don't think he had a point.
02:02:02 He just sort of like, I want him, I just, I'm just going to kill him.
02:02:04 Didn't he do it for like some satanic panic, like he's corrupting the youth kind of reasons?
02:02:10 No, I'm not sure.
02:02:12 I mean, John Lennon is prominent.
02:02:14 So he is a, he is a prominent or important person.
02:02:17 So by that metric, it could be an assassination.
02:02:20 I guess, I guess the distinction I'm making is like, how, how like deranged are you as the killer?
02:02:29 So if you are not deranged, so what you're saying is that assassination is murdered is good.
02:02:35 No, assassination is murdered as cold blooded and emotionless for some, for some specific agenda.
02:02:44 And murder is like, you can just, you could just, it could just happen.
02:02:50 If you're, you know, a little crazy.
02:02:51 Well, I mean, the guy tracked down John Lennon specifically to kill him.
02:02:57 It wasn't like he just did it on a whim.
02:03:00 Well, no, not the premeditated part of it is the same for both.
02:03:03 But like the reason you decide to do it in the first place.
02:03:08 Are you deranged or are you, are you putting politics into my murder?
02:03:15 I hate it when there's politics in my murder.
02:03:17 Murders these days are too political.
02:03:19 Absolutely.
02:03:20 We need to go back.
02:03:22 Yeah, we used to have characters.
02:03:23 We used to have Jack the Ripper.
02:03:26 Used to have, you know, when they had like little, little things they did with the police,
02:03:31 little notes and things they would leave.
02:03:32 What happened to that?
02:03:33 They were nice.
02:03:34 They were nice and neutral.
02:03:36 They were nice and neutral.
02:03:37 They didn't, they didn't discriminate except when they only killed women or whatever.
02:03:42 But you know, that's just, that's just good fun.
02:03:50 Assassination classroom.
02:03:54 That I used, I have so many of those comics.
02:03:58 I never finished it.
02:04:00 I've read some of it.
02:04:01 I think, I think Mage got me to read it and I thought it was okay.
02:04:05 I thought it was kind of neat, but I didn't stick with it.
02:04:10 It's assassination classroom, the one with the main character who is a boy that looks
02:04:14 extremely feminine because the author wanted it to be a girl.
02:04:17 But the manga publisher says, no, we kind of have a female lead.
02:04:22 I don't think so.
02:04:23 I mean, that, I think that is, well, the character does look feminine.
02:04:29 And no, that was like the backstory to it, though.
02:04:33 I'm pretty sure that was the backstory to that.
02:04:35 Assassination classroom is the one with like the yellow smiley alien guy.
02:04:39 Yeah, yeah.
02:04:40 But like the protagonist, like main character.
02:04:43 Oh, I think he's a school person.
02:04:48 Oh, I don't know.
02:04:51 People ask, is assassination classroom inappropriate?
02:04:55 For what?
02:04:57 I don't know.
02:04:57 It's just,
02:04:58 I mean, you couldn't have that in a school, in a school library.
02:05:01 Kids with guns.
02:05:01 Yeah, it's not assassination.
02:05:04 It keeps doing murder politically again.
02:05:06 You can't have, you can't have depictions of guns in a school library.
02:05:12 I mean, not when the kids are holding them and shooting the teachers with it.
02:05:16 Yeah, the rob pretending to shoot you.
02:05:19 But she doesn't, but he doesn't actually get shot though.
02:05:21 He dodges really quickly out of the, so like, it's fine.
02:05:26 Yeah, assassination.
02:05:27 Well, like, they don't want to give the kids ideas
02:05:29 that they should try to assassinate their teachers.
02:05:32 Come on.
02:05:33 Come on.
02:05:35 It's not me making the rules.
02:05:36 I'm just saying how it is weak.
02:05:41 Right.
02:05:41 This is the, this is the guy.
02:05:43 This is the male lead of the assassination classroom.
02:05:47 Eating a snack, holding the gun.
02:05:50 It's a knife snack.
02:05:53 Well, I forget why I read it.
02:05:54 So maybe it's incorrect, but it seems plausible.
02:05:58 Like, oh, you can't have, you can't have a shounen mango with a female protagonist.
02:06:02 We just don't do that over here because they don't.
02:06:04 Can we?
02:06:05 Do they?
02:06:07 Do they not?
02:06:07 The boy seems to be a boy.
02:06:09 Yeah, well, it is shounen jump.
02:06:12 Ain't it?
02:06:13 Boys can't read things with girls in it.
02:06:16 I'm trying to think if I can think of any shounen shows that have, I mean, um...
02:06:22 There's lots of female characters.
02:06:23 They're just always side characters or love interests or villains or whatever.
02:06:27 I mean, I can think of some animes with female protagonists,
02:06:31 but I'm not sure exactly which ones are shounen.
02:06:36 Yeah, like you specifically because it was in shounen jump, like
02:06:40 so shounen jump publisher.
02:06:41 Yeah.
02:06:42 That's what I heard, which is a funny story.
02:06:46 And it means that this guy is extremely effeminate and cute.
02:06:52 That's why I kind of wanted to read it, but I forgot.
02:06:55 I sort of lost interest somewhere.
02:06:58 I mean, Chrono Crusade has a female protagonist.
02:07:01 I don't know if that is shounen.
02:07:03 It probably is not from shounen jump.
02:07:07 I'm looking at a bunch of shounen jump covers and yes, it's all fellas.
02:07:12 As far as the eye can see.
02:07:14 It's all boys.
02:07:17 Well, now I'm wondering if there's ever been one with a girl.
02:07:22 Not in shounen jump.
02:07:23 I'm pretty sure.
02:07:24 So look at this, the fucking ninja turtle looking cover.
02:07:28 Yeah.
02:07:28 Every cover is just that with a different color, like a different expression.
02:07:34 This is the Japanese Watchman because of the smile.
02:07:39 I guess so.
02:07:41 I mean, Soul Eater has, I mean, it's got kind of like two protagonists and one of them is a girl.
02:07:48 Was that shounen jump?
02:07:50 I don't know if it's from jump.
02:07:53 Yeah, I would say it's shounen, at least.
02:07:55 It's definitely shounen.
02:07:58 Japanese manga.
02:08:01 Published by Square Enix.
02:08:04 Where is it?
02:08:06 Where does it come from?
02:08:08 Published by Square Enix in monthly shounen gang gang.
02:08:14 What?
02:08:15 Okay, so it's not shounen jump, but it is a shounen thing.
02:08:18 Shounen gang gang?
02:08:20 Monthly shounen gang gang is a manga in print owned by Square Enix Holdings.
02:08:27 That's funny.
02:08:28 Never heard of Square Enix doing non-video game stuff.
02:08:32 Oh, I mean, that doesn't surprise me.
02:08:33 They're like a pretty big company.
02:08:35 They have their fingers in a lot of Japanese culture pies.
02:08:42 I could go for some Japanese culture pie right about now.
02:08:49 I don't think the Japanese know what a pie even is.
02:08:53 I just don't think that that's a dish that they make.
02:08:56 They have dumplings, they have funny bread.
02:08:59 Exactly, exactly.
02:09:00 If the Japanese were going to make a pie, they would just make it as a dumpling.
02:09:05 They would just put blueberries and apples and cherries in a dumpling.
02:09:10 That sounds great, actually.
02:09:11 It probably could be pretty good, yeah.
02:09:13 Yeah, little steamed fruit, is that such a thing?
02:09:19 Sure, and I know this because in Pokemon, they eat fruit sandwiches, which are rice balls.
02:09:27 I know cakes are big.
02:09:30 Yeah, cakes are big.
02:09:34 My mind is blown just thinking that, yeah, I've never seen a chicken pie with the pastry
02:09:41 in a Japanese thing.
02:09:43 I don't think they do it.
02:09:44 I don't think they, I think it's a Western thing.
02:09:47 Wow, well, it's a European thing, which is a Western thing.
02:09:51 But also, surely they have pastry.
02:09:56 I mean, of course.
02:09:57 I mean, I'm sure they know what a pie is, and they could make one if they wanted to.
02:10:03 I just don't think they do very often.
02:10:06 And if they did, it would probably be like, oh yeah, this is like a European-style dish.
02:10:12 I looked up pie in Japan, and the first result says Japanese consumers love pie.
02:10:17 Boo, I don't care what they say.
02:10:21 That doesn't fit my narrative.
02:10:23 Okay, well.
02:10:25 Pastries in Japan.
02:10:27 I understand nice patisserie.
02:10:30 They probably have a lot of French things and Swiss stuff, Swiss rolls.
02:10:36 Wait, now I'm curious.
02:10:37 But Japanese-y-fying, some of them.
02:10:39 Wait, what does it say?
02:10:40 A pie with filling.
02:10:42 Do they have those?
02:10:43 What does it say about Japanese people that eat pie?
02:10:48 I want to know.
02:10:49 Oh, I closed the page.
02:10:50 Oh, come on.
02:10:52 I'm looking up choco pie now.
02:10:54 Oh, come on.
02:10:55 I'll never know.
02:10:56 My internet's broken again.
02:10:58 My internet's broken again.
02:10:59 Once again, even though this call is continuing without issue, my computer says,
02:11:04 nope, you're not connected to the internet.
02:11:06 You can't view web pages right now.
02:11:09 A square choco pie.
02:11:10 It's fluffy with marshmallow filling.
02:11:12 I like the fact that they say it's fluffy.
02:11:14 I don't know why that's funny to me.
02:11:17 It's a good thing to have trademarked.
02:11:21 They trademarked it's fluffy.
02:11:23 I guess so.
02:11:25 I want to bake something.
02:11:27 I think I need that.
02:11:28 I think I need a baking session.
02:11:30 I need to make some muffins or cupcakes or something.
02:11:33 Gingerbread.
02:11:34 Maybe I could make a gingerbread thing for the Christmas.
02:11:37 It's very effeminate.
02:11:38 Yeah, thank you.
02:11:41 Gingerbread house is going to start big.
02:11:43 Or gingerbread man, gingerbread woman.
02:11:46 My dad has made gingerbread houses for Christmas party.
02:11:51 Oh, centerpiece.
02:11:52 But also you can grab it and tear it apart and eat it.
02:11:56 So I know that's possible.
02:11:57 I could do that together.
02:12:00 That'd be fun.
02:12:01 Nice, yeah.
02:12:03 What if I made a gingerbread...
02:12:07 How do you do a gingerbread trans woman?
02:12:09 They're just called two arms, two legs.
02:12:14 How would you differentiate them?
02:12:15 You start by making a man and then you turn it into a woman.
02:12:19 By like adding a dress or something.
02:12:22 I don't know, it's easy.
02:12:23 But how would you do a gingerbread man?
02:12:25 You do a penis in the middle.
02:12:27 Yeah, and then you use three legs.
02:12:29 And then you yank it off of there.
02:12:33 You yank it off.
02:12:33 To be a man, you must have honor and a penis.
02:12:39 That's what Shin Chan says.
02:12:41 Very regressive of him.
02:12:44 Shin Chan.
02:12:46 You remember Shin Chan.
02:12:47 Is that the little tiny little guy?
02:12:50 Yes.
02:12:52 Dang.
02:12:52 That's the one.
02:12:52 I didn't know he was cringe.
02:12:54 Such a transphobe, I know.
02:12:57 Wait, you know who that is?
02:12:57 It's the cartoon...
02:13:00 It's the little kid, the little red shirt.
02:13:01 The cartoon toddler, yeah.
02:13:03 Who shows his little butt.
02:13:04 I'm not sure if he's a toddler.
02:13:06 I think he might be...
02:13:08 I haven't read any of it.
02:13:09 I'm not sure.
02:13:09 I'm not exactly sure how old he's supposed to be.
02:13:11 It's very unique looking.
02:13:12 Yeah.
02:13:13 I like the style.
02:13:15 He's got a game out on the switch that looks really good.
02:13:18 You ever see the English dub of that show?
02:13:22 Yeah, that's how I started it.
02:13:24 That was where they redubbed it all with Americanized jokes.
02:13:30 They changed a lot of it.
02:13:32 But I think it's good and it works.
02:13:35 And it's maybe funnier for it.
02:13:39 They sort of like...
02:13:41 I don't know.
02:13:42 They kind of change it to be a little bit more goofy and fourth wall breaking.
02:13:49 Whereas I think in Japan, it's a more straightforward family sitcom.
02:13:55 Because I think some of the humor plays as a little more adult over here in America.
02:14:00 Shinchin shown as disgusting little baby dick.
02:14:06 It just doesn't play.
02:14:07 So it just hits different.
02:14:09 It just hits different over here.
02:14:10 Oh yeah, you can put them PBS kids over here.
02:14:13 I don't think so.
02:14:13 I don't think so.
02:14:13 It's got to be an adult show now.
02:14:15 I think so.
02:14:18 LaMalle.
02:14:25 Merry Christmas.
02:14:27 Is this the Christmas special?
02:14:29 When is this coming out?
02:14:30 This is close to Christmas when this comes out.
02:14:31 Yeah, it's the week away now.
02:14:33 It'll be the 23rd.
02:14:35 It'll be the day before Christmas Eve.
02:14:38 Christmas Eve Eve.
02:14:41 My torrents are downloading at about half a megabyte per second and yet no internet lol.
02:14:50 It's getting slipped up by the torch.
02:14:54 I'm just so upset.
02:14:56 It's just not fair.
02:15:04 You know, it's like my internet.
02:15:07 It's like my internet.
02:15:09 You know, it likes me.
02:15:10 It's showing clear interest in me.
02:15:11 It's asking me questions about like, oh, do I live around here?
02:15:15 Oh, you know, it's getting on my bus with me.
02:15:19 But then when I ask if it wants to go out for coffee, it just laughs.
02:15:26 Then I ask, can you show me the images in my discord channel?
02:15:31 It just scoffs at me.
02:15:32 It just scoffs.
02:15:34 Well, what else?
02:15:36 What else have we got to speak about?
02:15:40 Well, now I'll never get to see this list of strongest female shown in characters.
02:15:45 I was pulling up a list.
02:15:46 I was going to go through the list and I was going to
02:15:49 find some good counter examples, but I guess, I guess it maybe it did appear,
02:15:55 but it was completely blank.
02:15:56 Yeah, it won't look because it doesn't exist.
02:16:01 I'm so stupid.
02:16:03 I'm sure there's more.
02:16:03 The only ones I can think of are Chrono Crusade and Soul Eater.
02:16:08 I mean, obviously there are more.
02:16:11 Chrono Crusade actually might be sign-in.
02:16:13 That might be a little too adult.
02:16:17 Not sure.
02:16:17 Who cares?
02:16:20 Are we moving on?
02:16:21 Okay.
02:16:23 What were you saying, Deadly?
02:16:26 I forget.
02:16:27 What was I saying?
02:16:30 Oh yeah, something I watched recently.
02:16:32 I want to know if anyone else has seen it.
02:16:35 It's the Adult Swim Yule Log video.
02:16:38 The Yule Log video.
02:16:40 Is that like one that you put on for Christmas and it just burns the log all day?
02:16:46 That's what you would expect from Yule Log video.
02:16:51 I haven't seen this.
02:16:52 I'm familiar with the genre, but no, I have not seen the Adult Swim one.
02:16:56 Okay, it's the kind of thing that is not a good thing to talk about because doing so would spoil it.
02:17:06 Have you ever seen the short Too Many Cooks?
02:17:09 Yes.
02:17:09 Oh, yes, yes.
02:17:11 It's the same creator had his hand in this.
02:17:14 So if you enjoyed that, I recommend watching the Adult Swim Yule Log.
02:17:20 That was all right.
02:17:21 Am I right in thinking that's the guy who did that series on YouTube about a character who was trapped
02:17:29 in an insane asylum and then there was a blue chair.
02:17:34 There was a repeating motif.
02:17:36 Blue chair?
02:17:36 Are you talking about Alan Tutorial?
02:17:40 Yeah, maybe.
02:17:41 Alan Tutorial, that's not the same guy.
02:17:43 Alan Rosnick though, he's got some crazy good stuff.
02:17:47 He did an edited footage of a bear.
02:17:49 I think that's one people know him for.
02:17:53 He did May Please Enter.
02:17:57 He did a lot of cool stuff.
02:18:00 But that's a different guy, I think.
02:18:03 Dang, I thought it was the same guy.
02:18:04 Yeah, Alan Tutorial.
02:18:06 This was fucked.
02:18:08 That was a great series.
02:18:11 I love crazy stuff like this, like great minds coming up with
02:18:17 such stuff and I'm watching it.
02:18:23 That's what I like.
02:18:24 I like crazy people.
02:18:25 Crazy people, please make more art.
02:18:28 This I recommend from him.
02:18:31 May you please enter.
02:18:32 It's a good story.
02:18:33 How long is the Yule Log?
02:18:38 It's like an hour and a half.
02:18:40 Oh, okay.
02:18:41 I found one that's like three minutes.
02:18:44 Dang, it's on HBO Max.
02:18:47 I see.
02:18:48 Well, okay.
02:18:49 Well, obviously I can't watch it right now then.
02:18:51 Lol.
02:18:52 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:18:53 Okay.
02:18:54 Sell it down for it.
02:18:55 That's all.
02:18:56 That's all.
02:18:58 Oh my gosh.
02:18:58 Next discussion topic.
02:19:00 I found the list.
02:19:02 Oh, I finally get those shonen girls.
02:19:06 I've never heard of that one.
02:19:07 I've never heard of that one.
02:19:10 I've never heard of that one.
02:19:12 Yep.
02:19:12 It's the sole leader girl.
02:19:14 Never heard of that one.
02:19:16 Never heard of that one.
02:19:17 Search where they put the marketing budget.
02:19:19 Never heard of that one.
02:19:20 Yeah.
02:19:20 Okay.
02:19:21 Ryuko Matoi from Kill a Kill.
02:19:24 Is that she?
02:19:25 That's it.
02:19:26 I mean, it's definitely not shonen jump.
02:19:28 It's not saying in.
02:19:31 I think you could argue it's shonen.
02:19:33 Definitely.
02:19:34 Yeah.
02:19:35 She's a good candidate.
02:19:36 I like her.
02:19:37 I think that one's fair.
02:19:39 Never heard of that one.
02:19:41 Never heard of that one.
02:19:42 I've never heard of that one.
02:19:43 From like the Dragon Ball creators early work.
02:19:47 Oh, Dr. Slump.
02:19:48 Is that a thrill?
02:19:50 Yeah, yeah.
02:19:52 Is that a shonen?
02:19:53 I thought it was just a comedy.
02:19:54 That's a shonen jump comedy.
02:19:56 Oh, it was on cut.
02:19:57 Yeah.
02:19:58 Yeah.
02:19:58 Wait, what was it called?
02:20:00 It's called Dr. Slump.
02:20:02 Oh, yeah.
02:20:02 Dr. Slump.
02:20:02 Okay.
02:20:03 Yeah, I've heard of it.
02:20:05 I've never read it.
02:20:07 I should read it at some point.
02:20:09 It's clearly going to have like things like, oh, shit.
02:20:12 That's where that Dragon Ball thing came from.
02:20:15 Over and over again.
02:20:16 Yeah.
02:20:20 All right, these are not.
02:20:21 These are not fucking shonen.
02:20:22 These lists sucks.
02:20:23 Never mind.
02:20:24 Okay.
02:20:25 All right.
02:20:26 That's just proven my point.
02:20:27 There are none.
02:20:30 Need more women.
02:20:31 We need more Clarissa Gunsmokes and shonen jump.
02:20:33 I guess I am wondering now if there's ever been a single one specifically from shonen jump.
02:20:39 That would be interesting.
02:20:42 There's probably been at least one and then it probably was a flop and they were like,
02:20:45 well, I guess we'll never do that again.
02:20:48 Yeah.
02:20:49 There's something that just don't get like translated that don't last more than a few chapters.
02:20:55 Yeah.
02:20:55 We never find out about them.
02:20:58 Yeah, for sure.
02:21:00 Ooh, related 15 Naruto characters you definitely want as a roommate.
02:21:05 I'm clicking that one.
02:21:07 Uh, Gara, because if you get sand in your between your toes, you could just get it right off.
02:21:12 Well, Shikimaru, because he would be uninvasive.
02:21:16 Neji, because he's clean and organized.
02:21:18 Sakura, because she says what she feels and cares deeply for her friends.
02:21:23 Choji, because he's a nice guy with great snacks.
02:21:26 Kiba, because he has a lovable canine companion.
02:21:29 Hinata, because she's nice and cooks amazing food.
02:21:31 It's just every character.
02:21:33 Naruto, because he would never say no to a trip to Ichiraku.
02:21:37 I don't know what that means.
02:21:38 Is that the ramen place?
02:21:40 Probably.
02:21:40 He would never say no to ramen.
02:21:42 That's why you want him as a roommate.
02:21:43 Great quality and a roommate.
02:21:45 Kakashi, because he could teach you how to be cool.
02:21:48 What the fuck?
02:21:51 Tsunade's decades of life lessons lend themselves as interesting stories.
02:21:56 That's awful.
02:21:57 Konoha?
02:21:58 Wait, the Konoha Gate guys would always be happy to hang
02:22:03 just those two guys who don't even have names.
02:22:06 Oh, Izumo and Kotetsu.
02:22:10 Just because they're nice.
02:22:11 Ebisu is highly responsible if a bit overbearing.
02:22:16 Well, why is he a good roommate if he's a bit overbearing?
02:22:18 Oh, we're getting higher up on the list, by the way.
02:22:22 Konan, because he isn't such a bad person after all.
02:22:28 He's in reverse order.
02:22:30 A redeemed gara would be easy to get along with.
02:22:33 Asuma Sarutobi is a cool uncle.
02:22:36 And number one, Tenten always keeps her cool around others.
02:22:41 I am going to shoot myself.
02:22:43 That list started off almost tolerable.
02:22:48 Maybe I missed something, but Tenten is almost a joke
02:22:52 in that she basically has no lines in the entire manga.
02:22:56 She doesn't say it, she doesn't have any,
02:22:59 there's no exploration into her as a person at all.
02:23:04 It's everyone else.
02:23:05 She's just because they needed a third partner for Neji.
02:23:09 Like, I'm sure there's like a couple lines saying,
02:23:14 oh, she's nice or she does this and maybe she makes a face.
02:23:17 But they never focus on her ever.
02:23:20 Not that I can recall now, lol.
02:23:23 She's the number one roommate
02:23:25 because she always keeps her cool around others.
02:23:29 Garbage.
02:23:31 Maybe that's fair.
02:23:32 Maybe the others are a little too extreme.
02:23:35 They're all crazy.
02:23:36 Why would you want to live with them?
02:23:38 No, Shikimaru was right.
02:23:40 The good one is right,
02:23:41 because Shikimaru would just leave you alone
02:23:43 and just not want to be bothered.
02:23:45 Yeah, Shikimaru is good.
02:23:47 Shikimaru and Neji.
02:23:49 No, I think Neji would be.
02:23:51 I think Neji would be a picky.
02:23:52 He would like, he would like-
02:23:54 Neji would be kind of cunty.
02:23:56 He would be kind of cunty and he would be like, you know,
02:24:00 why'd you leave, why'd you leave dishes,
02:24:01 why'd you leave dishes in the sink?
02:24:03 We agree that we would keep the common space clean at all times.
02:24:08 You're violating the terms of our roommate agreement.
02:24:11 You're violating the pact.
02:24:14 Violating the pact, the main family wouldn't do this.
02:24:19 The main family wouldn't leave dishes unscrubbed.
02:24:23 Keep Kiba because he has a dog.
02:24:25 That's awful.
02:24:27 Okay, I've done, I'm done.
02:24:28 No more, no more.
02:24:29 He specifically has a move with his dog
02:24:31 where he pisses all over the place.
02:24:33 Is that true?
02:24:35 Yeah, I think that's one of his comedy moves early on,
02:24:38 where he's like, haha, I got a dog.
02:24:40 Watch this.
02:24:41 It's a trick I call the urination nation.
02:24:43 Why doesn't he just-
02:24:44 Spins around with dog pisses everywhere.
02:24:46 Piss his own piss.
02:24:48 If he just wants to piss on people,
02:24:49 why doesn't he just pee himself?
02:24:51 He may do that, I forget if he does.
02:24:55 He acts like a dog, he's a real like-
02:24:57 With his dog, he has twice the piss.
02:25:01 Yeah.
02:25:02 He's double the-
02:25:02 Twice, that's a small dog.
02:25:05 He gets bigger.
02:25:06 Oh, I have not got that point yet.
02:25:08 The time skip, he's a wolf dog.
02:25:11 It becomes big.
02:25:13 I'm thinking about early dog.
02:25:15 I'm still early in the series.
02:25:16 I'm behind on so many things.
02:25:20 Wait, when did you get into watching or reading Naruto?
02:25:24 Um, I guess a few weeks ago.
02:25:26 I'm only at teaching exams now.
02:25:29 Well, that's the best part.
02:25:30 That's what everyone says.
02:25:32 And I'm having a good time.
02:25:33 That part's really good.
02:25:34 And then, I don't know, it's okay up until the time skip.
02:25:39 And then I think at, well, I don't know,
02:25:40 the anime kind of falls apart after the time skip.
02:25:43 It got really filler, heavy,
02:25:44 and I stopped watching around there.
02:25:47 I mean, I was young when I was watching it,
02:25:49 so I watched everything without knowing what filler was.
02:25:52 That's just like, why was the last like 50 episodes
02:25:55 just about stuff?
02:25:57 When are they gonna get back to Sasuke?
02:26:00 When are they gonna get back to him?
02:26:05 I don't know.
02:26:05 Nobody knows.
02:26:09 I'll enjoy it while I can then.
02:26:11 Oh, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say
02:26:14 it becomes shit.
02:26:16 It just sort of keeps going
02:26:20 and doesn't raise the stakes in a way that feels like,
02:26:26 like the stakes are raised, but I just sort of like, eh,
02:26:29 oh, oh, bigger and more powerful ninjas.
02:26:32 Yeah, sure.
02:26:34 It felt more scary in a battle with ninjas early on
02:26:40 with like Zabusa.
02:26:41 He's like, got a big sore and he'll fucking kill you.
02:26:44 Yeah, Zabusa was pretty scary.
02:26:46 It does feel like they're just scraping by a lot of the time.
02:26:49 Yeah.
02:26:49 And then later on, it's just sort of, I mean, that's the normal,
02:26:52 that's the normal shonen thing with like power level scaling
02:26:55 where the things they are capable of doing far outstrip
02:27:01 normal human capabilities,
02:27:03 so you can't quite connect to the danger they're in anymore.
02:27:06 Like if you see them take a thousand blows,
02:27:10 like blows, it's hard to know how many more blows they can take,
02:27:16 because I've never even taken one blow like that.
02:27:18 I'd be killed instantly.
02:27:22 Yes.
02:27:23 Yes.
02:27:25 Like, I like things to be grounded in reality.
02:27:28 If a bullet is fired, it should be,
02:27:32 it should, you should be scared of the character getting shot
02:27:35 in the head and being,
02:27:36 It should kill you if it hits you.
02:27:37 Does this apply to one piece?
02:27:39 Because I feel like the opposite happens there.
02:27:42 I mean, I'm still early on,
02:27:44 but none of the guys Luffy has faced so far
02:27:47 seem to be much trouble for him.
02:27:50 Ah, well, with that, it starts off like, he's super strong.
02:27:55 In the same way that Dragon Ball starts off,
02:27:57 Goku is just stronger than everyone,
02:27:59 and it's kind of a comedy because of how strong he is,
02:28:01 and he's a tiny little kid.
02:28:04 But then it becomes more serious later on.
02:28:07 And I think one piece does that.
02:28:11 The first chapter, I think,
02:28:14 Luffy gets shot with a bunch of bullets,
02:28:16 like, ha, fuck you, or he gets shot with a bullet from a gun.
02:28:20 And you think, oh, shit.
02:28:21 But no, it goes, it stretches out inside him,
02:28:25 and then he like unstretches,
02:28:27 and he blasts the bullet back because he's made a rubber.
02:28:30 How did that happen?
02:28:32 And it's like, that's so crazy.
02:28:34 Bullets can't hurt this guy.
02:28:36 This guy's insane, but bullets very quickly
02:28:38 don't become important after that.
02:28:41 Yeah, it's the kind of joke you could only do once.
02:28:44 How, wait, you're not very far into it.
02:28:46 How far are you?
02:28:48 I got pretty far in high school up until Chopper shows up,
02:28:52 but then I forgot everything that happened
02:28:54 because I went to college and learning pushed it all out of my mind.
02:28:58 So I'm starting over now.
02:29:00 I see.
02:29:01 Yeah, that's, I mean, that's, it's kind of far,
02:29:04 but it's in the grand scheme of things.
02:29:05 It's actually not that far.
02:29:06 I know, it's not, it's not crazy far.
02:29:08 It's only like 10 volumes or something.
02:29:11 I think Chopper, Drum Island,
02:29:14 I'm trying to think of like the first time it feels like
02:29:16 it's actually like they could fucking all die.
02:29:20 And I think it's, it's maybe like the giant island
02:29:25 where Mr. Three gets them all in the wax.
02:29:29 And it's unsure.
02:29:30 It's like unclear how they're gonna get out of it.
02:29:36 I don't, damn it.
02:29:38 I mean, obviously there's danger.
02:29:40 I don't like super like remember that very well.
02:29:43 It's, it's the island with the two giants on it,
02:29:45 Dorian Broggy.
02:29:46 Oh, yes.
02:29:48 They're fight.
02:29:49 And then there being a, there's Miss, Miss.
02:29:56 Oh, what's the little girl with the paint?
02:29:58 It's called Miss Golden Week, I think.
02:30:02 Yeah.
02:30:03 Which is a Japanese holiday.
02:30:04 And then Mr. Three who has the wax devil fruit.
02:30:08 And they, and there also is like Miss Valentine
02:30:13 and Mr. Something.
02:30:14 Valentine is the spiky one, right?
02:30:17 No, oh, Miss Wednesday.
02:30:20 I can't remember.
02:30:21 But she's the one who like changes her white
02:30:24 and the guy who shoots boogers.
02:30:26 Oh, hers is cool.
02:30:27 Her fruit is cool, the weight, the weight changing one.
02:30:31 Yeah.
02:30:31 So those people are there and they're on this island
02:30:38 with the giants and they get all separated with stuff.
02:30:42 And then there's a part where Mr. Three makes this giant wax cake
02:30:46 and he gets them all waxed up and they can't leave.
02:30:51 And they're being turned into wax sculptures with this candle at the top.
02:30:57 That's like raining down wax particles.
02:30:59 And Zoro is like, well, I may as well strike a cool pose if I'm going to die.
02:31:04 So he holds his sword up.
02:31:07 I remember that very fondly.
02:31:09 Yeah.
02:31:10 That was a big like, oh, shit, is Zoro going to die?
02:31:12 He tries to cut his own legs off to get out of there.
02:31:17 I feel like I feel like I felt like they were in real danger like against
02:31:26 I think, I mean, against, I think it was against Kuma.
02:31:30 Or what's the one where like...
02:31:35 Spoilers.
02:31:36 Oh, yeah, never mind.
02:31:39 I'm sure by the time I get there, I will have forgotten.
02:31:43 Yeah.
02:31:43 I only mentioned the giant island because that's past, that's before they meet Chopper.
02:31:49 Right, right.
02:31:50 I vaguely remember that.
02:31:52 What can I say without spoiling too much?
02:31:59 I like One Piece.
02:32:01 Yeah, I like One Piece.
02:32:03 It is so fucking good.
02:32:06 Yeah, One Piece is not grounded in that way at all.
02:32:12 Even early on, I remember watching the anime and there's like a moment where
02:32:17 Nami changes her mind and decides to jump on the boat as they're leaving that little town.
02:32:25 This is before Arlong Park or anything.
02:32:27 Is there no new, there's no new chapter this week?
02:32:30 No, this wasn't a bummer.
02:32:32 It was on a break.
02:32:33 Damn.
02:32:34 But like she jumps and she jumps like 14 feet.
02:32:38 Like it's just like a super long jump, but it's not like mentioned as like a
02:32:45 superhuman feat of strength or special abilities.
02:32:48 It's just sort of like, yeah, people can jump really a lot.
02:32:52 That's just sort of a thing in anime or manga where like the superpowers are so insane that
02:33:00 like normal actions are also kind of like brought up to insanity.
02:33:04 That's kind of why.
02:33:04 They can jump off of the second story of a building and just land on the ground and not be
02:33:09 like broken-legged.
02:33:10 That's kind of why I feel like I wasn't that upset by the
02:33:15 I won't say what it is, but like the reveal about that fruit, that one particular fruit,
02:33:21 you know, the one didn't bother me that much because like we really already well past the
02:33:28 point where like these characters are powerful to the point that like you can't really relate to
02:33:33 them.
02:33:34 They can like take cannonballs to the face and like mostly be fine nine out of 10 times.
02:33:41 Yeah.
02:33:42 I think what I really appreciate about One Piece is more so the emotional
02:33:48 connections that they make and sort of the visceral like catharsis of seeing the bad guy
02:33:56 get punched really hard after being a real shithead.
02:34:00 It's I don't know how it's different from other shounen, but One Piece just does it really good.
02:34:05 They set up the villain so that you're so happy when they get punched.
02:34:09 Oh, man.
02:34:10 I feel like in Naruto, it's a little.
02:34:12 I really like there's a lot of emo stuff that's just sort of doesn't.
02:34:16 What was the feel the same?
02:34:20 Yeah.
02:34:20 What was the name of the villain in the Fishman Island arc?
02:34:27 Fishman Island.
02:34:28 Yeah.
02:34:30 That would be Hody Jones.
02:34:31 Hody Jones.
02:34:32 Hody Jones was so I hated him so much.
02:34:35 They did such a good job of making me hate that guy.
02:34:39 Oh, and Van der Decken.
02:34:41 That was the other guy.
02:34:43 Something Van der Decken.
02:34:44 Who the fuck is that?
02:34:46 Hody Jones was the Fishman and something Van der Decken was another Fishman who had the
02:34:52 devil fruit of throwing.
02:34:54 Oh, he could touch something and throw it at you and it would find you.
02:34:58 Yeah.
02:34:59 I sort of remember this guy.
02:35:05 Did he do anything?
02:35:06 Yeah.
02:35:08 He was the reason the boat, the Moby Dick or whatever it was called.
02:35:15 Like the giant ship, the Noah's Ark.
02:35:19 Yeah, that thing.
02:35:20 He touched that boat and threw it and he threw it at Fishman Island and they had to stop it.
02:35:28 Oh, I forgot.
02:35:31 I forgot.
02:35:31 He's the reason that was happening.
02:35:34 And I think Luffy punched it.
02:35:35 Yeah, but Hody Jones was like the leader.
02:35:39 He was the leader of the punk shark bastards or whatever they were called.
02:35:45 No, not the Sun Pirates.
02:35:46 Those are the good guys.
02:35:48 The Fun Pirates.
02:35:50 They're all Fun Pirates.
02:35:52 What was the name?
02:35:55 Wasn't it like, oh, didn't they have, they had like a tattoo and then they covered it up with
02:36:01 the Sun Pirate Tattoo, right?
02:36:03 Yeah, the Fishman were slaves and they had a brand marked on them front by the Tenryubito.
02:36:11 And so Fisher Tiger, like the freer of the Fishman slaves, the big boy, he turned that
02:36:20 branding into a new logo that would be the Sun Pirate logo.
02:36:26 Did Hody Jones, were they Sun Pirates too?
02:36:29 I don't remember.
02:36:30 I think they were like, they knew Arlong, who was a Sun Pirate guy.
02:36:35 Yeah, I forget if like, maybe they, the Hody Jones guys were not actually Sun Pirates.
02:36:44 I can't remember.
02:36:45 I thought maybe they did something else with the tattoo.
02:36:50 Looks like you're gonna have to read it again.
02:36:52 I guess I'll have to read it all again.
02:36:55 It's so great.
02:36:56 It's so great.
02:36:57 Oh, Hody Jones has, he's got like a different, he's got like a different tattoo.
02:37:03 Like, look at this.
02:37:04 Oh, he, oh, he's got like the big sun.
02:37:08 He's got like the racist version of the Sun Pirates tattoo.
02:37:10 Lol, so awesome.
02:37:15 What a little, little bastard.
02:37:18 Yeah, it's the sun, but on the inside is like the no humans.
02:37:22 No humans, that's his thing.
02:37:27 They love Hody Jones.
02:37:30 The most despicable villain.
02:37:33 They all got great names.
02:37:35 Yes, I love Otis naming conventions.
02:37:39 They're just so satisfying.
02:37:41 Like Thriller Bark as an island, as a ship.
02:37:46 I love that.
02:37:47 I just, I just love it.
02:37:50 Skypia.
02:37:51 Tell us how you really feel about it though.
02:37:54 Um, uh, I hate it.
02:37:56 Okay, that's cool.
02:37:59 Nice.
02:38:03 I'm sad.
02:38:03 I'm sad.
02:38:04 There's no new episode.
02:38:04 I didn't realize they were on break, bummer.
02:38:08 I think it said break next week on the chapter.
02:38:10 Oh, well.
02:38:13 It's funny that Otis can just do that whenever he wants.
02:38:16 What are they going to tell him?
02:38:18 No.
02:38:19 I mean, he's a hard-working guy, but yeah.
02:38:24 I mean, many manga authors go on like hiatuses to like,
02:38:30 to like just still, you know, take a break after like years of
02:38:35 consistently producing high quality stuff.
02:38:38 To take a break after years of coming.
02:38:39 But Oda, Oda takes like a maximum like two weeks of a break sometimes.
02:38:46 Yeah.
02:38:46 Which is like, it's so, people still get mad about it, but it's like, it's unbelievable.
02:38:53 How much good shit he's made consistently for how many years?
02:38:59 Like 25 years?
02:39:00 How long has it been?
02:39:02 Uh, it's gotta be at least like 20 years.
02:39:04 Yeah.
02:39:09 1997.
02:39:12 Uh, that's why that's, um,
02:39:16 Check this out.
02:39:17 23 years and then 22.
02:39:22 Check it out.
02:39:23 It's the Virgin, Hodey Jones versus the Chad Arlong.
02:39:29 Racist for no reason.
02:39:30 It has a good reason to hate humans.
02:39:34 Uh, oh, that's right.
02:39:36 Hodey Jones wasn't a slave.
02:39:38 He was just, he was like of the generation after.
02:39:43 Yeah.
02:39:44 Yeah.
02:39:44 He was the generation after he literally just like carried on hating humans for no reason at all.
02:39:51 He just like, he just thought it was like what he should do as like part of like fishman culture.
02:39:56 Literally just like, we have to return to the good old days of hating humans.
02:40:00 Cause like, I just think things, I know I wasn't born back then.
02:40:02 I just think things were probably better back then.
02:40:05 He's literally like that.
02:40:07 Villain of the Ark where the series went from good to great.
02:40:10 That's true.
02:40:10 I think that's true.
02:40:12 I, yeah, I would say that as well.
02:40:13 I think at the time I remember thinking like, like the Arlong arc was where I was like, okay,
02:40:18 I think, I think this is actually, I really like the series now.
02:40:23 How long, when does that come about?
02:40:26 That's, that's when Nami joins.
02:40:28 That's when Nami joins.
02:40:29 That's pretty early.
02:40:29 It's in East Blue before the grand line.
02:40:31 So that's pretty early on.
02:40:32 But it's, it's such a cool moment cause it's.
02:40:36 Yeah.
02:40:37 It starts off goofy enough, but the, the, the villain is stronger than any other villain so far.
02:40:44 And it's just, they build him up to be such a, like a ruthless person that couldn't,
02:40:53 could not possibly be toppled.
02:40:55 The whole town is scared of him.
02:40:57 And then Luffy and the boys, they just roll up.
02:41:00 They barely know what's going on.
02:41:02 Luffy has no idea and he doesn't want to know.
02:41:04 He just knows that Nami's crying and he healed protector.
02:41:07 So he goes into the, he just barges in to the bad, big bad like guy that has been built up.
02:41:13 To be so dangerous.
02:41:15 And then they just fight and he destroys the building and he destroys.
02:41:19 Oh, and the moment, the moment where he kicks like Nami is like,
02:41:22 like indentured servitude, slavery, like a map charting desk, kicks it out of the window
02:41:29 and she sees it and he just destroys the room where they kept Nami like hostage
02:41:34 and forced her to draw maps for them.
02:41:37 And she starts crying and then, and they just, he just destroys everything
02:41:43 and it comes out of the rubble and he asked Nami to join the crew or something.
02:41:48 I like when he, I like when he just, just deflects how strong he is.
02:41:51 He just like flips houses upside down just because he can do that.
02:41:59 Yeah, they arrive and they're like, what's up with this street?
02:42:01 All the houses are upside down.
02:42:04 Oh, that's because of the fishmen.
02:42:05 They're so strong.
02:42:06 Or along just does that just to fuck with people.
02:42:11 What an arc.
02:42:12 Yeah.
02:42:12 What a, what a story.
02:42:14 Yeah.
02:42:16 I don't know.
02:42:16 I mean, the fishman, the fishman arc, I don't know if I'd call it a nothing arc,
02:42:20 but it is like way too long.
02:42:24 It's, it's, yeah, it's, it felt a little bloated, I think.
02:42:28 Yeah.
02:42:28 The fishman island.
02:42:30 Much like Hody Jones himself with his big old puffer fish gut.
02:42:35 No, no, it's a good, no, it's a good character though.
02:42:38 I gotta get back to drawing Clarissa Gunsmoke.
02:42:43 I gotta get back to make my stupid book.
02:42:46 I've only got, oh fuck, I've only got like a week and a half to finish it.
02:42:50 Ha, ha, ha, I gotta draw a cover.
02:42:52 Oh no.
02:42:54 Everyone needs to like Clarissa Gunsmoke.
02:42:56 She's such a female character.
02:42:58 She's a leading role female character.
02:42:59 You gotta get her put in Shonen Jump.
02:43:03 I gotta go to Shonen Jump.
02:43:04 I say, hey, I know I'm not Japanese and I have a very odd art style
02:43:07 for, for a manga, but put this in there.
02:43:10 Hey, I know that like you don't, yeah, first of all, not Japanese.
02:43:14 Second of all, not a manga.
02:43:16 Second of all, female characters and you never do those.
02:43:18 But I've got a genius plan.
02:43:20 What if we had the first female character in a Shonen Jump manga
02:43:24 and it was Western and it wasn't manga?
02:43:25 And they're like, oh my god, I can't believe it.
02:43:27 Oh my god, we've gotta do it.
02:43:29 I never, nobody, I didn't think of this before.
02:43:32 What if we broke convention?
02:43:34 Ah!
02:43:35 I'll be there.
02:43:37 I'll be reading it.
02:43:40 And then I'll go on, I'll go on all the Japanese forums
02:43:44 and they'll say, oh, this sucks.
02:43:45 Fucking woman.
02:43:46 Yeah, but yeah, they'll say.
02:43:46 But I won't be able to read it.
02:43:47 I won't be able to read it, so I won't even feel bad.
02:43:49 They'll say, they'll say, they'll say this lady's got bold ideas
02:43:54 of taking this company in a new direction.
02:43:56 We're going to make her our assistant vice president.
02:43:59 And then all, everyone on the forums is,
02:44:01 and then, and then everyone, everyone on the west
02:44:04 is like, oh, oh, this crying soy face.
02:44:07 It's like, oh, this new vice president.
02:44:08 Oh, they put her manga in the thing.
02:44:10 It's not even manga.
02:44:11 Oh, it's a girl main character.
02:44:12 Oh, this is not even Japanese.
02:44:14 Oh, real Japanese people don't even know
02:44:16 what trans people are.
02:44:17 They're ruining culture.
02:44:21 It's colonizing it.
02:44:23 Oh no, I'm doing colonization.
02:44:26 And that seems like it would be pretty fun.
02:44:30 So let's do it.
02:44:31 Yeah, that's my new goal is to take
02:44:33 over, show and jump.
02:44:35 Time to colonize with my British genes.
02:44:42 I'm made for this.
02:44:43 I'm made for destroying other cultures.
02:44:46 This is what I was built for.
02:44:49 It's good to see someone use colonization
02:44:52 for good to destroy anime.
02:44:56 I'm feeling like are we getting on towards voicemail time?
02:45:09 I think so.
02:45:11 I don't want to kick you off deadly,
02:45:14 but I mean, we are at almost three hours.
02:45:17 And you would probably be bored by voicemails
02:45:20 because they would not have anything to do with you.
02:45:23 You know what I mean?
02:45:25 It doesn't have to do with me for me to be not bored.
02:45:28 Try to bully deadly comics off the show.
02:45:31 If you want to hang out for voicemails,
02:45:32 I mean, yeah, okay, we can do that.
02:45:35 I guess I just, you know, I just, you know,
02:45:38 I just like to politely assume that our guests
02:45:41 have better things to be doing.
02:45:43 But I mean, if you don't, I guess.
02:45:47 Not really.
02:45:48 Okay, all right.
02:45:49 Hell yeah.
02:45:51 Let's grab a, let me do that then.
02:45:55 Let's see how many we got this week.
02:45:56 Hopefully none.
02:45:59 Oh my God.
02:46:01 So people just record things and send them to you?
02:46:03 Yeah, they just, we have a website called Speakpipe
02:46:08 where people can just deposit.
02:46:10 Yeah, it's basically like a voicemail service.
02:46:14 Do you listen to them before you put them on the air?
02:46:17 We used to, but no, under my leadership,
02:46:21 we have adopted an anarchist philosophy
02:46:24 where whatever's there is what gets listened to.
02:46:29 Yeah.
02:46:29 And if it sucks, that's too bad.
02:46:32 Yeah.
02:46:33 And spoiler alert, it usually sucks.
02:46:38 No, that's not true.
02:46:39 No, that's not true.
02:46:40 No, that's fine.
02:46:41 No, we love it.
02:46:41 We get some good ones.
02:46:42 We do get some good ones.
02:46:44 All right.
02:46:45 Oh, hang on.
02:46:46 Hang on.
02:46:46 We got a message from Cheezy.
02:46:47 Hey, can I jump in on this?
02:46:48 I'm totally awake right now.
02:46:50 Cheezy, you're too late.
02:46:51 This is the end.
02:46:53 I guess, I guess we can.
02:46:55 I don't mind.
02:46:57 Just for the questions segment.
02:46:59 I get to meet a new person.
02:47:01 What do you think, deadly?
02:47:02 Should we let Cheezy jump in?
02:47:04 I love to meet new people.
02:47:06 I love to meet new people.
02:47:07 Do you know who Cheezy is?
02:47:09 I don't know.
02:47:09 Okay.
02:47:10 Well, he's a comic artist who is funny
02:47:13 and he gets people mad at him on Twitter sometimes.
02:47:16 He loves clowns.
02:47:17 He loves clowns.
02:47:18 He does love clowns.
02:47:20 Who doesn't, right?
02:47:21 Oh, yeah.
02:47:23 But nobody loves them as much as Cheezy does.
02:47:27 Hey, Cheezy, how you doing?
02:47:29 I'm doing pretty good.
02:47:30 You got any, what?
02:47:32 What was that?
02:47:34 I was going to say, do you got any updates this week?
02:47:39 Do you have anything interesting happening in your week?
02:47:43 Anything interesting?
02:47:44 Did anything interesting happen to you?
02:47:49 In the week?
02:47:51 Did anything interesting happen to me?
02:47:53 Yes.
02:47:54 Yes.
02:47:54 I'm asking if anything interesting happened to you this past week.
02:47:59 Wait, wait, let me get this straight.
02:48:01 You're asking, wait, hold up, hold up, wait, you're talking too fast.
02:48:05 Wait.
02:48:06 So you're asking me, me, if anything interesting happened to me
02:48:14 in the past seven days?
02:48:17 I am.
02:48:17 Which you're asking for?
02:48:18 Indeed.
02:48:19 Okay, all right.
02:48:21 Okay, anything interesting?
02:48:22 Okay, no.
02:48:25 Anything interesting?
02:48:27 Anything.
02:48:28 Anything.
02:48:28 Anything.
02:48:29 Anything.
02:48:30 Anything.
02:48:31 No rules.
02:48:32 Any, how much longer, how much longer is this going to be?
02:48:36 I just, I just want you to be clear because I don't want to say something and then I don't
02:48:40 want you to be like, oh, you can count.
02:48:41 We are, you have 10 seconds to answer the fucking question.
02:48:48 This time limit wasn't imposed at the beginning.
02:48:51 I don't like this.
02:48:54 All right, so I guess, no?
02:48:56 Okay, well, maybe something interesting happened.
02:49:00 I don't know.
02:49:01 My business.
02:49:05 Let's listen to the first voicemail.
02:49:09 The first voicemail is called Aiden.
02:49:11 And it will be Aiden and a Benton.
02:49:18 I have a cousin named Aiden who I saw yesterday, but his name is not spelled.
02:49:23 Hey, I can't, I can't, it's not, it's not posting.
02:49:26 It's not posting.
02:49:27 Lol.
02:49:28 Is there a, is there a cousin white?
02:49:29 Is he like a white guy?
02:49:30 Yeah.
02:49:30 Yeah.
02:49:31 Oh, okay.
02:49:32 That's kind of cringe.
02:49:33 I guess that's a pretty, I guess that's a pretty white name.
02:49:36 All right, let's do it.
02:49:38 Three, two, one, go.
02:49:40 Hello.
02:49:43 This is Aiden and I'm reporting from the Rowdy fuckers cop killers.
02:49:49 And I was told by Marilyn to say hello to Ben and to call you a cop kisser.
02:49:58 You are a cop kisser.
02:50:00 Fuck you.
02:50:02 You're a bitch.
02:50:04 And finally, killers once again, bullying Ben
02:50:09 as they should.
02:50:10 Yeah, uh, I'm bullying you.
02:50:13 You're a nerd.
02:50:13 I bet you get wedgies at school and you never asked Veronica for her number.
02:50:22 And you still get upset about it to this day.
02:50:25 All right.
02:50:26 Okay.
02:50:26 Bye.
02:50:26 Y'all have a good podcast.
02:50:33 But I asked, but I did, but I asked, but I asked Bousra, but I asked Bousra
02:50:39 out for coffee.
02:50:40 Okay.
02:50:40 Look, I took my shot.
02:50:42 Yeah, I didn't ask Veronica for her number, but you know, I learned from that mistake.
02:50:46 I learned that you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
02:50:50 I'm more of a Betty kind of guy than a Veronica kind of guy.
02:50:53 Which one's the blonde one?
02:50:55 Betty.
02:50:57 Is there like, wait, aren't they both like exactly the same except one is rich and the other's not?
02:51:03 Okay.
02:51:03 Betty is the girl next door.
02:51:06 She's like your childhood friend ever.
02:51:08 Veronica is implied to be like new to the school.
02:51:12 But they're both just kind of like catty bitches.
02:51:15 No, no.
02:51:16 Veronica's more catty.
02:51:18 But one of them is your another, the Japanese word, another Japanese word that I learned from Tim Rogers.
02:51:26 The one that means your childhood friend from a time before you can even remember.
02:51:31 And also you are in love, I guess.
02:51:35 Yeah.
02:51:36 Archie invented that.
02:51:38 Archie and Betty are that?
02:51:39 Oh, that's so sweet.
02:51:41 Yep.
02:51:43 Yeah, they invented it.
02:51:45 Another thing those Japanese stole from us.
02:51:48 Tezuka stole the idea.
02:51:51 Well, wait, was it Tezuka?
02:51:53 Nah, wait, was it Tezuka who popularized that?
02:51:55 That can't be.
02:51:55 No, I don't think so.
02:51:56 I don't think it even comes from like Osan, Osananajimi.
02:52:06 I think that's what it means.
02:52:08 You should, I got a suggestion for a new segment on the podcast.
02:52:13 Each episode you learn a new Japanese word.
02:52:16 And then over a course of like 5,000 episodes, you will know Japanese.
02:52:21 Only 5,000 words.
02:52:22 Gib, you know what is actually better?
02:52:25 Probably better than any of the action button reviews.
02:52:28 If you haven't watched an action button review and you want to watch something by Tim Rogers,
02:52:31 genuinely, you should watch the slow translation of Final Fantasy 7 is probably better than any of
02:52:37 the action buttons.
02:52:39 And that's a really good series.
02:52:41 Okay.
02:52:42 And that's where I learned the word Osananajimi.
02:52:52 Looks like you need to rewatch.
02:52:53 Nanna, nanna, nanna, nanna phone.
02:52:58 Where did I put that, where did I put that link?
02:53:02 Alright, hey, I like that this killer is bullying me.
02:53:06 You know what, it's good.
02:53:07 I like, I like that spunk.
02:53:09 I like that spirit.
02:53:10 I like to see the grit and gumption.
02:53:12 You passed the test.
02:53:13 Yeah, good, good on you.
02:53:15 Good, good effort.
02:53:18 Let's see if I can actually listen to my fucking messages again.
02:53:21 No, Gib, help.
02:53:23 Oh, should I post the next one?
02:53:25 Please.
02:53:26 Okay, the next one is called,
02:53:29 By the Ways, Prince Isolation at Twitter.com.
02:53:35 Wait, why is it down?
02:53:37 Why did it, why did it post like this?
02:53:40 Okay, it's not playing.
02:53:42 I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill myself.
02:53:45 Oh, the second one?
02:53:46 No, Ben, don't kill yourself.
02:53:47 I'm gonna kill myself.
02:53:49 So you just have sexy.
02:53:50 Ha ha, don't do that.
02:53:52 I'll never, I'll never, I'll never, I'll never have coffee with Busuda and I'll never get to hear
02:53:58 what Prince Isolation had to say in his speak pub.
02:54:00 So what's the point?
02:54:01 What's even the point of anything?
02:54:03 Ben, the most beta move ever is to let Trixie outlive you.
02:54:11 Really, what if she like makes like a 360 and she becomes the best YouTuber,
02:54:17 the best anti-tuber again on YouTube, huh?
02:54:19 Yeah, I should, I should, I should keep living just to make sure that that never happens.
02:54:24 You're right.
02:54:25 It's a little life going.
02:54:27 I'll keep, yeah.
02:54:28 You're the guy for them.
02:54:29 It's a wonderful life, but instead you make like all the potential futures,
02:54:33 you make like trans women's lives worse by staying alive.
02:54:38 Well, that's, well, that's the, that's the plot of the Christmas.
02:54:41 It's a terrible death.
02:54:43 That's the, that's the plot of a Christmas, the Christmas special of married with children.
02:54:47 You know about this?
02:54:50 In married with children, there's a, there's an, it's a wonderful life parody episode
02:54:55 and Al sees that in the world, in the, in the version of the world where he was never born,
02:55:02 everything is better.
02:55:03 And so it inspires him to, to keep on living because he, he hates them all and he wants to
02:55:07 like punish them.
02:55:08 I mean, he's like, I won't let them have that.
02:55:10 I don't want good things for them.
02:55:12 I'm going to come back to life and ruin it.
02:55:14 And that's what he does.
02:55:16 That's also the premise of the robot chicken skit where, where Wimpy from Popeyes
02:55:21 killed, he's about to kill himself.
02:55:23 But then the angel shows him the, the universe where he wasn't born and everything's better.
02:55:28 All in all, it has like huge titties, Popeyes and Blutos aren't enemies no more.
02:55:32 Everything's going perfectly.
02:55:34 And the angel just kills and the angel just kills Wimpy instead.
02:55:38 Oh wow, fairly odd parents did that as well.
02:55:42 Well, that's the whole genre now is anti.
02:55:46 It's a wonderful life.
02:55:47 Well, now, well, now I, well, now I have to wonder if, if whether married with children
02:55:51 was even the first one to do it.
02:55:54 I mean, it feels like an obvious joke, right?
02:55:58 Like, yeah, it kind of does, but your presence makes things worse.
02:56:03 I guess if you were, yeah, maybe no, now, hmm, I wonder.
02:56:09 Ben, if you didn't exist, Nate would have never gone into ponies.
02:56:14 Thus, those who would never have met Michelle.
02:56:16 I wonder, I wonder, I mean, Charles Dickens was really popular even in his own time.
02:56:23 I wonder if people were writing like parodies of it's a wonderful,
02:56:26 wait, no, that's not by Charles Dickens.
02:56:28 No, it's a film.
02:56:32 What was it from like the fifties?
02:56:34 Uh, I, I think so.
02:56:37 I mean, it was a, it was a big film.
02:56:38 I wonder, I wonder if people were parrot.
02:56:40 I wonder if whatever the, like the, the, the contemporary equivalent of like Saturday Night
02:56:44 Live was at the time, did like a parody of it where they were like, ha, ha, what if,
02:56:50 when you die, if it was actually good, if you never survived, never lived.
02:56:56 Fascinating.
02:56:57 Ah, man.
02:56:58 Fascinating.
02:56:59 For the longest time, I thought that it's a wonderful life was read in by, um,
02:57:03 Rod Serlin, the creator of the Twilight Zone.
02:57:06 But really, I was missing form.
02:57:08 I wasn't him.
02:57:08 I thought it was because like the whole premise feels like
02:57:11 the Twilight Zone Christmas special almost.
02:57:14 A little bit.
02:57:15 Yeah.
02:57:15 Yeah.
02:57:16 Yeah.
02:57:16 Yeah.
02:57:16 I see what you, I see what you're saying.
02:57:18 1947.
02:57:20 That's like two years after World War II ended.
02:57:22 Yeah.
02:57:24 And I saw they said it was communist propaganda.
02:57:28 Um, and they were right.
02:57:28 It's a beautiful wife.
02:57:31 It's a beautiful my wife.
02:57:33 You know what I had?
02:57:34 It's a beautiful my wife.
02:57:35 You know what I had yesterday at the my family Christmas party?
02:57:38 Eggnog.
02:57:39 Nice.
02:57:40 With whiskey.
02:57:40 Was that, did it, did it have egg?
02:57:43 I don't know if it had egg.
02:57:45 I've been told conflicting things that, yes, Eggnog always has egg from other people.
02:57:50 It's not true.
02:57:51 It's not necessarily true.
02:57:53 Commenters, please explain.
02:57:57 I mean, maybe like tradition, the tradition, maybe the most traditional homemade kind.
02:58:04 You guys heard that?
02:58:06 Was that you?
02:58:07 I did.
02:58:07 Was it you blowing your nose?
02:58:09 No, that was my partner's sleep right now.
02:58:12 Was it a snore?
02:58:14 Yeah, they were snoring.
02:58:15 Jesus Christ.
02:58:16 Yep.
02:58:17 I was a little tired.
02:58:18 I mean, it worked late.
02:58:20 I was going to say, oh, Ben, you think you could, if I put a gun to your head.
02:58:25 Yeah.
02:58:26 And I told you to rank your family members from everyone who showed up at the Christmas party.
02:58:32 From like your, your favorite to your least favorite.
02:58:35 You think you can do it being a ranked them?
02:58:38 Yeah, but like, you don't know any of these people.
02:58:40 It wouldn't mean anything.
02:58:41 Ben, I'm the man with the gun.
02:58:45 The point is to, is to get you to say something that, oh, they might hear and they might be like.
02:58:51 High tier.
02:58:54 High tier.
02:58:56 Zero.
02:58:57 Cousin, cousin Maddie.
02:58:59 Base.
02:59:00 Uncle Peter.
02:59:02 Cousin Al.
02:59:03 Al's wife wrote, no, Al's wife Rose.
02:59:09 Cousin Luke.
02:59:12 Uh, and then, uh, should we tell oblivion fall to jump in?
02:59:20 You know, it's so funny.
02:59:21 It could be making up those names.
02:59:23 Yeah.
02:59:23 Um, uh, Uncle George, Uncle Paul, Uncle Ringo.
02:59:28 Okay.
02:59:28 I would say, okay.
02:59:29 Okay.
02:59:29 Okay.
02:59:29 Pete, Peter's family is just better in general.
02:59:33 Chris's family is okay, but Chris himself is kind of a weirdo.
02:59:36 Uh, your family member has family guy names.
02:59:43 Oh, uncle Peter and at Lois and little cousin Stewie.
02:59:48 Uh, of, uh, so, uh, yeah.
02:59:51 And then, uh, who, I mean, who else was even there?
02:59:54 Um, I think that was pretty much it.
02:59:57 Was it, was there, was there, I don't, am I forgetting?
02:59:59 It was all them.
03:00:00 And it was all their like wives and it was all there.
03:00:02 And then some of their kids, uh,
03:00:06 Are you anyone's cool uncle?
03:00:08 I, I do have some, no, wait, I'm not, I'm nobody's uncle.
03:00:12 I guess if my cousin has a kid, am I their great uncle or am I their like,
03:00:16 I think that's, that's uncle once removed.
03:00:19 I think I'm the second, I think I'm their second cousin.
03:00:23 I think, I think me and my cousin's kids are second cousins to each other.
03:00:28 Hey, that's, that's uncle Ben.
03:00:30 Oh, what's so great about him?
03:00:31 He's friends with Mary weather.
03:00:32 Oh, he is.
03:00:33 And then they go up to you and they punch you in your stomach.
03:00:35 Um, uh, I mean, I mean, uh, and then I, I, I, I feel like, um, I feel like, uh,
03:00:48 I kind of have to, I feel like I kind of have to put my uncles on a separate
03:00:51 list for my cousins on a separate list for my cousin's spouses.
03:00:55 Uncle ranking as opposed to aunt ranking.
03:01:02 So what's this voicemail say?
03:01:04 I don't know.
03:01:05 I'm just, I'm just wasting time because I can't listen to it.
03:01:09 Oh, you not, you cannot.
03:01:11 Yeah.
03:01:14 I mean, I can just doesn't, just doesn't play.
03:01:17 Dang, it just doesn't play and I can't download it from the website or anything,
03:01:23 even though my internet is like perfectly functional.
03:01:25 Download speed, uh, 300 kilobytes per second.
03:01:28 It's perfectly healthy.
03:01:30 Uh, well, what do we do?
03:01:32 Should we listen to it for you?
03:01:35 No, what if it's towards Ben?
03:01:38 Well, then we'll just lie.
03:01:41 We should just, I mean, I think oblivion is, is, uh, is jumping in.
03:01:46 So maybe he can save us.
03:01:50 I'm looking, I'm looking up who a deadly comics is.
03:01:53 You're popular.
03:01:54 You don't, you don't know deadly comics?
03:01:56 No.
03:01:58 Well, he didn't know you either.
03:02:00 Well, I'm not surprised.
03:02:02 I do now and we're all best friends.
03:02:05 That's right.
03:02:06 Stop lying to me.
03:02:07 No, you're lying.
03:02:09 You're lying when you say that isn't true.
03:02:11 You're lying to yourself.
03:02:13 Yeah.
03:02:14 Let us in.
03:02:15 Cheesy, let us in.

03:02:23 Three, two, one, go.
03:02:27 By the way, if you're wondering,
03:02:28 hmm, where is that big bottle on Kemic Man's back attached?
03:02:36 It doesn't seem that he has any straps.
03:02:39 Is it perhaps bolted or glued to his back?
03:02:45 No, actually you Philistine.
03:02:48 Obviously it is supported at any and all times canonically by
03:02:55 Kemic Man's big, huge, fluptuous,
03:02:59 quirked up white boy ass.
03:03:02 And that is canon and real.
03:03:07 I said so.
03:03:08 I'm the creator and therefore.
03:03:10 He gets to make these decisions.
03:03:12 True.
03:03:12 True.
03:03:13 True.
03:03:13 Okay.
03:03:14 Well, thanks for clarifying.
03:03:16 Yeah.
03:03:17 I was wondering.
03:03:17 So you got that, that crunked up white boy shelf.
03:03:21 Did you see that video that was going around on Twitter of a girl
03:03:24 riding a horse and her ass is like so big and like jiggling out of her like,
03:03:31 like jeans and like her.
03:03:33 Link it.
03:03:33 Link it right now.
03:03:34 Yes.
03:03:34 I saw that exact.
03:03:35 Link it.
03:03:36 Yeah.
03:03:36 Yeah.
03:03:36 Like I'm talking about.
03:03:37 I saw it right now.
03:03:38 Like it.
03:03:39 Please.
03:03:39 Link it.
03:03:39 Hey, actually I'm going to link it.
03:03:41 I'll try to find it also.
03:03:43 Hey, oblivion.
03:03:43 Are you recording?
03:03:45 Yes.
03:03:45 I started recording before I hopped in.
03:03:46 Great.
03:03:46 Great.
03:03:47 Hello.
03:03:48 Cool.
03:03:48 Welcome.
03:03:49 Nice to meet you.
03:03:50 Hello.
03:03:50 Yeah.
03:03:51 Nice to meet you for the first time oblivion.
03:03:54 So oblivion, you know, we have Cheesy and oblivion.
03:03:58 Have you not?
03:03:58 Yeah, we've been on Cheesy's podcast.
03:04:02 He's crazy.
03:04:02 He's dangerous.
03:04:03 Stay away from him.
03:04:04 Yep.
03:04:05 I am a crazy dangerous individual.
03:04:10 Deadly.
03:04:10 Do you know oblivion fall?
03:04:13 Do you lie?
03:04:14 I don't know if you know me.
03:04:15 I thought you might have seen his animations around.
03:04:20 I may have.
03:04:21 Yeah, we have.
03:04:22 You ever seen that one video of the guy who puts a jar up his butt?
03:04:27 I haven't seen it.
03:04:27 I don't know if you've seen it.
03:04:28 Have you ever seen Lemon Party?
03:04:31 No.
03:04:32 That's not me.
03:04:33 Let's just say he hosted that party.
03:04:36 I'm trying to think because I used to, you know, I know you from like the My Little Pony days.
03:04:41 I was an animator in that community back then.
03:04:44 And they probably have seen your stuff.
03:04:46 Yeah, you must have the horse animations.
03:04:50 Yeah, I don't know.
03:04:52 It doesn't matter if you know me.
03:04:53 I know you and you're good.
03:04:54 You're good.
03:04:55 You're cool.
03:04:56 You're based and epic.
03:04:58 Whoa.
03:04:59 Thanks for the kind words.
03:05:00 You are all as well.
03:05:02 Wow.
03:05:03 Pleasant people.
03:05:06 I'm not sure if I can find this video.
03:05:12 I mean, I don't know how to find it.
03:05:15 But then you busted my balls now.
03:05:18 It was pretty hot.
03:05:19 You can't just talk about a jiggly butt.
03:05:22 Yeah.
03:05:23 And not show.
03:05:24 I wish I could.
03:05:26 You're hiding her from me.
03:05:27 You are.
03:05:28 I saw it.
03:05:29 You foul beast.
03:05:31 Oh, does someone's Twitter account and they had retweeted it?
03:05:34 Libyan can confirm that it's true.
03:05:37 I'm not lying.
03:05:38 Then you try to keep her to yourself, all to yourself then.
03:05:41 You're all just going to have to take my word.
03:05:43 Her butt was like a giant pair of titties that don't fit, that are like falling out of the...
03:05:49 Don't...
03:05:49 And her titties?
03:05:51 They were like a giant butt.
03:05:55 Sure.
03:05:56 Oh my god.
03:05:57 Listen, I would help if I could, but I can't.
03:06:00 It's out of my hands.
03:06:01 Dang.
03:06:02 That butt's in the wild somewhere.
03:06:04 It's out there.
03:06:05 It's out there if you can find it.
03:06:09 You're going to have my butt.
03:06:10 I left it for you all in just one piece.
03:06:13 Oh, I found it.
03:06:14 Yeah.
03:06:15 How'd you find it?
03:06:16 Yeah.
03:06:16 I just typed big butt horse, horse riding butt or something.
03:06:22 That scene, I'm amazed.
03:06:24 I didn't think you could find it.
03:06:27 We'll post it.
03:06:27 We'll post it.
03:06:28 Well, these are reposts, but I mean, it doesn't matter.
03:06:32 It doesn't matter.
03:06:32 Close enough.
03:06:32 I'll put it in chat.
03:06:34 In fact, I will press the button on my computer that lets me just download videos as mp4 is that way.
03:06:42 L.E.S.R. can easily put it in the edit.
03:06:44 Bzoom.
03:06:46 W.
03:06:48 Oblivion with the W.
03:06:52 What the hell?
03:06:52 It's not loading for me.
03:06:54 Oh, it is like titties.
03:06:55 Oh, you're right.
03:06:56 Yeah, you should have said the thong made it look like titties.
03:07:00 I mean, I guess.
03:07:02 More in terms of the way that it's spilling over.
03:07:05 Like it's made out of jelly, but there's zero muscle.
03:07:08 It's all jelly.
03:07:10 Nice.
03:07:12 Nice.
03:07:13 I hate muscle.
03:07:14 I anti muscle.
03:07:15 Nice.
03:07:16 OK.
03:07:17 L.E.S.R. on regular show.
03:07:19 Muscle man.
03:07:20 Yeah, it's just a bunch of girls on horses with their butts out.
03:07:23 Like this is this is the ideal future.
03:07:27 But I need horses on on top of big butt girls is what I need.
03:07:34 All right.
03:07:35 Well, now I would thoroughly derailed the voicemail segment.
03:07:39 We got another voicemail.
03:07:41 Yeah.
03:07:42 We got yet more voicemails.
03:07:45 This one's called on the topic of Tim Rogers.
03:07:47 Can you listen to this one, Ben?
03:07:51 Yeah, it's not.
03:07:54 It's not working.
03:07:55 It's not working.
03:07:57 Oh, wait.
03:07:59 Yes, it is.
03:07:59 Yes, it is.
03:08:00 Yes, it is.
03:08:00 OK, let's do it.
03:08:01 Perfect.
03:08:02 OK, three, two, one, go.
03:08:04 Tim Rogers videos are about a man's connection to art or a video game.
03:08:08 They are as much about him as they are about what he is reviewing.
03:08:10 And that's all right.
03:08:12 I see art as a two-step process, the creation and audience connection.
03:08:15 This type of video is what Jacob Geller and H Bomber Guy do, too.
03:08:19 I find it fascinating to listen to an interesting person explain their experience
03:08:22 with a piece of art and it helps me to connect with art on a higher level, too.
03:08:25 As an aside, I think judging an artist based on their fan base
03:08:27 to be quite a strange way to approach it,
03:08:30 which is what you seem to be doing with your negative interaction with that white knight.
03:08:33 Um, no, I mean, no.
03:08:35 First of all, I agree with what you're saying about the point of the videos.
03:08:39 And yeah, I agree.
03:08:40 And I feel that way, too.
03:08:41 And it's fine.
03:08:44 I'm not judging the videos based on that one,
03:08:47 the fact that some people are weird.
03:08:49 I'm just saying that some people that are fans of him are weird about it.
03:08:54 That's all.
03:08:57 Yeah, I would agree with this statement.
03:09:00 But I do have a critique of Tim Rogers because I tried to watch one of his videos.
03:09:07 I can post it.
03:09:09 I wrote a little thing.
03:09:11 Oh, where did I write it?
03:09:13 This is the...
03:09:14 We're on the, like, Gibb's struggles to watch a Tim Rogers video, arc.
03:09:20 Yeah, this is the arc.
03:09:21 This is going on for like a month now.
03:09:24 Well, I mean, I've got to the point where I tried to watch a video and it was the last of us video.
03:09:32 And I think it's just the parts that people say are good were annoying me.
03:09:37 So this is what I said.
03:09:38 I'm trying to watch a Tim Rogers video on the last of us and I'm getting frustrated.
03:09:42 He's just showing me his video games.
03:09:44 I don't know what point he's making.
03:09:47 It gives me the impression this video is not long for a good reason.
03:09:50 And I want to start skipping around.
03:09:52 I think he does, like, eventually come to a point.
03:09:55 But I feel like he had, like...
03:09:58 Oh, that's the one, like, he's showing...
03:09:59 He's actually, like, showing his, like, collection of games.
03:10:02 Like, it's one that Naughty Dog sent to him, I think, right?
03:10:06 No, he's showing every single game he has in his collection.
03:10:10 And then before that, he explains why he has such a small collection.
03:10:14 And it's all building to a point, but it just...
03:10:16 It seems to take way too long because I feel like I get it.
03:10:20 But anyway, the next thing I said is I hate this guy, Lol.
03:10:23 I don't like how he enunciates every syllable of a word, every letter it feels like.
03:10:30 I thought it was a bit, but I think that's just how he talks or how he's choosing to talk.
03:10:35 And he's choosing to talk in a kind of weird way.
03:10:38 Like, the video is a joke, and he's above it and above me for listening to it.
03:10:43 And my patience has run pretty thin.
03:10:45 When is he going to be a real person?
03:10:47 That's what I want to know.
03:10:49 He's, like, 100% sarcastically saying everything, but some parts are framed as jokes.
03:10:55 So, obviously, some parts have to be genuine.
03:10:58 And I can't tell the difference.
03:11:02 I just wanted to talk normal.
03:11:04 I feel most of that.
03:11:05 I feel most of that.
03:11:08 That's my problems with Tim Rogers.
03:11:10 He talks annoying, and I can't tell.
03:11:13 He's very sticky.
03:11:14 And he's definitely putting on a voice at all times.
03:11:18 Even when he's not doing his, like, I'm reading a video essay voice,
03:11:24 he still has, like, kind of an affected voice bit that he's doing.
03:11:30 I'm convinced.
03:11:31 A bit.
03:11:32 I mean, he has his, like, I'm reading a script in a dramatic fashion voice,
03:11:38 and then he's sort of got his, like, he's kind of like, he's kind of casual,
03:11:42 like, I'm just fucking around, you know?
03:11:45 Like, that's his, but, like, that's also a living you don't know who we're talking about.
03:11:51 I looked him up, and then I'm like, oh, this is the action button thing.
03:11:56 People have been talking about this guy's videos and telling me to watch it.
03:11:59 I looked at this guy's face, and he has a dumb face.
03:12:05 Yeah, get his ass.
03:12:07 He looks like, to me, he looks like Monkey Jones.
03:12:12 He looks like, like, 70s Monkey Jones.
03:12:17 I don't know.
03:12:17 He's the Jones that will break your bones, man.
03:12:19 And the most recent thumbnail, anyway.
03:12:22 I'm not exactly sure what it, who I think he looks like.
03:12:27 I don't know what this guy looks like.
03:12:28 But yeah, that's, that's, my main gripe is just the way he talks is, is annoying.
03:12:34 But more or so, because I can listen to people with annoying voices,
03:12:37 it's that the video was three hours long,
03:12:40 and I don't think he made a single point for the first, like, 30 minutes.
03:12:44 And I was like, when are you going to say anything?
03:12:46 When is anything going to come out of your mouth?
03:12:49 Kind of like talking to my mom.
03:12:50 I'll be honest, I don't really remember
03:12:55 that one very well.
03:12:56 So I'm not sure like, maybe it's a bad example.
03:13:00 It's just sort of like,
03:13:03 I feel like I needed to be part of a fan club that is very well versed in Tim Rogers
03:13:10 to get anything out of the things he was saying.
03:13:12 Because I didn't get it.
03:13:14 I didn't care about anything like he's showing me all his games.
03:13:17 I'm like, cool.
03:13:19 Where are you going?
03:13:20 This is not really related to that review.
03:13:24 It doesn't really reflect on the quality of the video at all.
03:13:26 But I think in that video,
03:13:29 he mentions that he mentions that Vito Gueswoldy is his friend,
03:13:33 and then he tells Vito that like his house is dirty and he should clean it.
03:13:36 And I don't like Vito Gueswoldy.
03:13:38 So I think that's a cringe moment.
03:13:40 That's a Tim Rogers L right there.
03:13:43 I knew him look like Monkey Jones was a warning.
03:13:49 Anyway, I might give it another chance.
03:13:51 I might give a different video another chance.
03:13:53 I think you should watch the slow translation of Final Fantasy VII,
03:13:57 aka Let's Mosey, the whole playlist.
03:13:59 That's a great series.
03:14:01 That's a very interesting series.
03:14:02 You learn a lot of Japanese in it.
03:14:05 I hate Japan.
03:14:07 Oh, well, then I guess we're fucked.
03:14:09 I guess it's not going to work.
03:14:10 He only has seven whole videos.
03:14:12 How could there be a series?
03:14:14 Well, that's not it.
03:14:15 No, those are not here on his channel.
03:14:16 Those other videos were on Kotaku,
03:14:19 because he used to make videos for Kotaku.
03:14:21 Oh, okay.
03:14:23 Yeah, I've heard of Let's Mosey.
03:14:26 Let's Mosey is not an action button.
03:14:28 Action button is like his personal channel
03:14:30 from after he split from Kotaku.
03:14:32 I listened to like two hours.
03:14:34 That's why people knew this guy before he had a channel
03:14:36 is because he was from Kotaku.
03:14:38 Yeah.
03:14:39 I listened to like two hours of the
03:14:41 Tokimeki Memorial video and like, I don't know.
03:14:44 It's I felt like it was talking too much about his own personal life.
03:14:48 And I mean, he definitely is doing that.
03:14:50 He definitely is doing that.
03:14:52 I just, I guess I'm not sure where's the end point.
03:14:55 Like, I feel like I already need to be a fan of this guy
03:14:58 to watch anything he's doing.
03:15:00 I watched the Tokimeki Memorial video first,
03:15:02 and I did find it strange and sometimes off-putting,
03:15:06 but I mostly enjoyed it.
03:15:08 And yeah, and I guess that was my end.
03:15:12 And now I was like, okay.
03:15:15 And then I went back and I watched the other ones,
03:15:16 and I was able to.
03:15:18 I didn't, I didn't mind the, like, yes, he definitely goes off.
03:15:24 He's definitely off on a tangent about himself most of the time.
03:15:27 Oh, are we doing, are we doing sight lines?
03:15:29 Look, he, look, I'm just saying
03:15:32 this channel is definitely disorganized.
03:15:34 It definitely makes no sense.
03:15:35 It's no cohesion.
03:15:36 Oblivio, what the fuck is this?
03:15:38 Did you do this last time?
03:15:40 He's looking in completely the wrong direction.
03:15:44 These are just incorrect.
03:15:45 None of his videos are connected.
03:15:46 None of them, like, he never looks at himself.
03:15:49 Only the characters look at him.
03:15:51 Why do you do this?
03:15:53 Why do you do this?
03:15:55 These arrows are completely random.
03:15:58 And you know what's even, when he posts another video,
03:16:01 the arrows are going to point in completely different places,
03:16:03 and it's going to get even worse.
03:16:05 That's video, they're going to be pointed directly at you.
03:16:07 He's clearly looking in any direction.
03:16:08 He's looking, like, vaguely towards the camera,
03:16:11 and I have to, like, interpret, like, yeah,
03:16:13 but, like, surely his eyes aren't exactly towards the camera.
03:16:16 They're, like, 1% up and down,
03:16:18 and I have to, like, interpret that.
03:16:19 It's really difficult.
03:16:20 I can't tell how genuine you're being right now.
03:16:23 Okay, but does Tim Rogers hide his dick
03:16:25 when he's posing for pictures,
03:16:26 or does he put his hands back like it's alpha?
03:16:28 Okay, there is a really, I honestly, I don't even mind it,
03:16:31 but it's weird to describe it.
03:16:33 There's a section in the Cyberpunk video
03:16:35 where there's, like, half an hour,
03:16:36 there's fully, like, half an hour of him, like,
03:16:39 in a white room, like, modeling various, like, jackets,
03:16:42 and boots, and jeans that he owns.
03:16:45 And he just is, like, doing that for a while,
03:16:48 and he sort of ties it in to the themes of commercialism
03:16:53 in Cyberpunk fiction or something, I guess.
03:16:58 I would like it if he would, like, tighten up his scripts.
03:17:02 Just say less.
03:17:04 I can't find a picture of Tim Rogers showing his crotch.
03:17:08 That picture does not exist.
03:17:10 The scripts are not, the scripts are not tight.
03:17:12 The scripts are anything but tight.
03:17:14 Well.
03:17:15 But tight.
03:17:16 But tight.
03:17:20 Not like that girl on the horse.
03:17:22 Her butt was anything but tight.
03:17:23 Hey, I mean.
03:17:24 Now she was talking about video games.
03:17:26 Now listen.
03:17:27 Now if her butt was talking about video games,
03:17:29 I'd watch that for six hours.
03:17:31 The problem is Tim Rogers,
03:17:33 Tim Rogers isn't enough of a psycho for me to like,
03:17:36 you know, because I'm a big fan of white boys,
03:17:38 but especially if they're crazy, like Ben.
03:17:40 Absolutely.
03:17:41 Thank you very much.
03:17:41 Those are the best kind of white boys
03:17:43 that are crazy boys.
03:17:44 I would say Tim is a little bit quirked up.
03:17:47 Maybe a little, maybe a little too quirked up.
03:17:49 He's quirked up, but he's not,
03:17:52 but he's not busting it down sexual style.
03:17:54 No, I would not describe him as busting it down sexual style.
03:18:00 He's quirked up, but not busting it down sexual.
03:18:02 That's his problem.
03:18:03 You're right.
03:18:04 He's got one, but not the other.
03:18:05 You need both.
03:18:05 You have a point.
03:18:07 Now Donald Trump, now there's a white boy
03:18:09 who is busting it down sexual style.
03:18:10 Did you see his physique?
03:18:12 Did you see his physique in those NFTs?
03:18:14 Did you see he's like, he's like nine heads tall.
03:18:16 He's like nine heads tall in those NFTs.
03:18:18 He looks fantastic.
03:18:19 He gets nine heads every day from random women.
03:18:25 Yes.
03:18:27 On Truth Social, I go there and I tweet it.
03:18:30 You're no longer allowed to post about Truth Social on Twitter.
03:18:34 That's crazy.
03:18:36 They ban accounts that promote Instagram,
03:18:39 Truth Social, Mastodon.
03:18:41 They're like, announce this today.
03:18:42 Instagram.
03:18:43 Yeah, Instagram.
03:18:46 You see that?
03:18:46 Oh my God, my speech is so free.
03:18:49 Did you see that one?
03:18:50 Comedy is so legal.
03:18:51 You see that couple, half a day,
03:18:53 where they took off the Spaces feature on Twitter for half a day?
03:19:00 I'm not sure if we talked about that last week.
03:19:01 We didn't talk specifically about that.
03:19:03 Was that even the last week?
03:19:04 I thought it was just a few days ago.
03:19:05 Just a few days ago.
03:19:07 Yeah, okay.
03:19:08 He had a Spaces moment where he got a big L,
03:19:12 he got owned live on stream,
03:19:14 and then he destroyed the functionality of Spaces.
03:19:18 I don't know whether literally because he got owned,
03:19:20 but it was very funny that he got owned
03:19:22 and then deactivated that functionality.
03:19:26 It says, we no longer allow free promotion
03:19:29 of certain social media platforms.
03:19:31 Specifically, we will remove accounts created solely
03:19:34 for the purpose of promoting other social platforms
03:19:37 and content that contains links or usernames
03:19:40 for the following platforms.
03:19:41 Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, TruthSocial,
03:19:44 Tribal, Noster, and Post.
03:19:49 It sounds like they'll fucking ban you
03:19:51 if you have your Instagram linked in your bio.
03:19:54 That's stupid.
03:19:56 Or even if you just post about it at all.
03:19:58 I feel like this is not even legal.
03:20:01 I don't know about that.
03:20:03 It's a level of like, oh, you can't talk about
03:20:09 a competitor's social media website.
03:20:12 Will ban you? Will ban mention of it?
03:20:14 Like, I feel like there's got to be some law
03:20:17 that prevents that sort of-
03:20:18 I don't know if it's illegal, but I think it's-
03:20:20 And it's a private company.
03:20:21 I think it's bad practice.
03:20:24 Like, you want-
03:20:25 I feel like it's got to be illegal somewhere.
03:20:27 You want to be interconnected.
03:20:28 Like in the EU maybe, for like anti-monopoly laws.
03:20:32 I'm going to start a social media where
03:20:36 it's like everything free.
03:20:37 It's the ultimate free speech social media.
03:20:39 You just cannot talk about my ex-wife's new husband.
03:20:42 That's the one rule is don't-
03:20:44 No!
03:20:45 Anyone who mentions Derek will be banned.
03:20:49 I might not agree with my ex-wife's new husband,
03:20:54 but I will defend to the death your right to talk about him.
03:20:58 No, ban, ban, ban.
03:20:59 Okay, shit.
03:21:00 Get him out of here!
03:21:01 Get him out of my social media!
03:21:02 Get him out!
03:21:04 Can we get that-
03:21:05 Yeah.
03:21:06 Next voicemail is an image.
03:21:08 And it's this.
03:21:09 This is the image.
03:21:11 Is it-
03:21:11 Is it you guys making up?
03:21:12 Was that not posting?
03:21:13 Why is it not posting?
03:21:14 I don't mind.
03:21:14 I see it.
03:21:17 Hey, does anyone know who these bitches are?
03:21:22 Wasn't it like-
03:21:23 I don't know.
03:21:24 These big titty bitches?
03:21:25 Yeah, have you seen these before?
03:21:26 I- I- These are from something,
03:21:28 and I don't know what it is, but it's somewhere-
03:21:29 Oh, did we not-
03:21:30 Did we not-
03:21:30 Her shirt says,
03:21:31 lesbians are awesome.
03:21:33 Yeah.
03:21:35 This is, um...
03:21:37 These are from, like, an old webcomic.
03:21:42 And I-
03:21:42 And I can't remember what it was called.
03:21:44 This is-
03:21:45 This is kind of awesome.
03:21:46 Wait a minute.
03:21:46 They didn't look kind of familiar.
03:21:48 What-
03:21:48 What is it?
03:21:50 Is it-
03:21:50 This must be-
03:21:51 This-
03:21:51 This must be the, like, Radcon 2.
03:21:53 This must be, like, Radcon 2 or Ben.
03:21:56 Um...
03:21:57 Well, I wish I could remember-
03:21:59 I- I wish I could remember-
03:22:00 Shanty Lover.
03:22:00 What- What is it about my posture here?
03:22:03 Is this-
03:22:04 Is this-
03:22:05 Is this-
03:22:05 I feel like this pose is, like, a reference to something.
03:22:08 Your legs are way too short.
03:22:09 I think you-
03:22:09 Your legs are way too short.
03:22:10 I mean, you're just walking.
03:22:12 Seems like it's clipped from-
03:22:14 From, like, a Radcon video.
03:22:15 I do look short.
03:22:16 I don't know.
03:22:17 Something about this pose just reminds me of something, but-
03:22:20 Is it-
03:22:20 Is it that Leonardo DiCaprio meme where he's str-
03:22:23 Striding?
03:22:24 He's walking?
03:22:24 No.
03:22:25 That's from, like, the front.
03:22:27 I mean, if I passed by these in real life,
03:22:29 yeah, I probably would turn around and look with a big smile on my face.
03:22:33 That's, like, the worst pants you could wear.
03:22:35 We're seeing big-titty lesbians, I feel.
03:22:37 Yeah, I- I don't look great.
03:22:39 I don't look great.
03:22:40 Yeah.
03:22:42 Right, exactly.
03:22:43 Don't look now, but here comes that anti-
03:22:44 that ant-
03:22:46 ant-gay-lover-nut.
03:22:48 So, one, the count of three lets me kiss you, like-
03:22:51 Like, it's our last-
03:22:52 This is, like, a panel.
03:22:53 This is, like, an actual quote from the comic.
03:22:55 I'm convinced.
03:22:56 Who is this?
03:22:58 Someone help me-
03:22:59 Show yourself now.
03:23:00 Yeah.
03:23:01 You want to find the source material.
03:23:02 You want to read it?
03:23:04 Yeah, I actually do want to read it.
03:23:06 That's the right-
03:23:07 We tried to find out on, like, shitty webcomic,
03:23:09 like, archive things, but we couldn't find it.
03:23:12 I couldn't.
03:23:13 Is it that obscure?
03:23:15 Who's sending in the voicemails?
03:23:17 It's not that obscure because I've seen it on, like,
03:23:19 something awful and stuff before.
03:23:22 Um, I like that.
03:23:24 I want to-
03:23:25 I want to redraw this.
03:23:26 This looks pretty-
03:23:27 Do they have a lot of legs or is that a dress?
03:23:31 I think that's full of a dress.
03:23:34 I like to think they got a lot of legs.
03:23:36 They're octopuses.
03:23:36 They're, like, Squidward.
03:23:38 They could also have that.
03:23:40 One of them is a cat as well.
03:23:41 One of them is a cat.
03:23:43 I'm not sure why, but-
03:23:45 Well, why not?
03:23:47 Yeah.
03:23:47 And that's, uh, and that's Ben in the corner.
03:23:51 That's Ben in the corner.
03:23:52 He's in the even more spot, like, losing his dummy worms.
03:23:56 Losing his virginity.
03:23:58 Losing his virginity.
03:24:01 Okay, that was better.
03:24:02 I like that one.
03:24:02 That was better.
03:24:04 Good job, Giv.
03:24:05 It's the next one is a vocaru link.
03:24:07 Oh, thank you.
03:24:08 Can you click on that?
03:24:10 Yeah, I think it's loading.
03:24:11 Give it a second.
03:24:16 Let me-
03:24:16 Let me just say, can I just say that, uh,
03:24:19 I was being mean and bullying unique Namasaurus on Twitter earlier,
03:24:23 and he called-
03:24:24 He called me an idiologue.
03:24:26 So, uh, let's kill him.
03:24:29 Yeah, sure.
03:24:29 He's a log.
03:24:31 He is a log.
03:24:32 That reminds me of some other kinds of logs.
03:24:34 I'm gonna get his ass.
03:24:35 I think he's-
03:24:36 I think he's ignoring me.
03:24:38 I think he's-
03:24:38 I think he's-
03:24:39 I think he's giving me the brush up.
03:24:41 I am tempted to watch the short version of his video
03:24:44 to see if he kept the pan peaks upright in there.
03:24:47 I refuse to watch the shortened version.
03:24:49 I refuse to-
03:24:51 I saw a couple minutes of it,
03:24:53 and it just felt like the longer version,
03:24:54 but he sped up the audio and only got to the certain points.
03:24:58 He did add a couple of extra, like,
03:25:00 like in the long version, he goes through, like,
03:25:03 one at a time.
03:25:03 He goes for every small artist that NFTs helped.
03:25:06 And then this one, he just kind of just says, like,
03:25:08 oh, it's helped a lot of small artists,
03:25:09 and then he names a couple of new ones.
03:25:11 That's so smart.
03:25:12 That's so smart.
03:25:13 I'm honestly, it's not even-
03:25:15 It's not even that he's, like, NFTs are okay.
03:25:20 That's not even why I hate him so much.
03:25:22 It's just-
03:25:23 It's just white.
03:25:23 He's such a fucking nerd and such a fucking dweeb,
03:25:26 and he thinks he's so smart.
03:25:27 He thinks he's so smart with his dog shit arguments,
03:25:29 and I just want to kill him.
03:25:31 I just want to kill him.
03:25:33 Ah, man.
03:25:34 I never did that one video.
03:25:35 The-
03:25:36 I watched the eight hour long NFT defense,
03:25:38 so you don't have to,
03:25:39 because I was too busy making comics.
03:25:41 That's right.
03:25:42 There's better-
03:25:43 There's better things to do.
03:25:44 Better things to do in my time.
03:25:47 The vocru is still not-
03:25:50 Well, we can-
03:25:51 I can just say it was sounds of jacking off.
03:25:55 Oh, okay.
03:25:56 The vocru is implying-
03:25:57 It's just 10 minutes of heavy breathing,
03:25:58 and then pfft at the end.
03:26:00 The vocru is implying that when gifts post selfies,
03:26:05 this individual views it as masturbation material.
03:26:09 Oh, I understand.
03:26:10 The vocru is implying that Gibbon take is sex-
03:26:13 I understand.
03:26:15 The vocru is implying that Gib looks pretty good.
03:26:19 Thank you for clarifying.
03:26:22 Thank you for clarifying.
03:26:22 Finger, finger guns, bang, bang, bang.
03:26:25 Thank you, voice mailer.
03:26:27 Thank you, kind mailer.
03:26:30 Thanks.
03:26:30 Please send-
03:26:31 Please send more.
03:26:32 Next.
03:26:33 Next one is Aiden, again, Aiden II.
03:26:37 Don, it's been a minute long.
03:26:39 Okay, this one's working for some reason.
03:26:41 Okay, three, two, one, go.
03:26:44 Hey, this is Aiden.
03:26:45 I'm reporting from Cop Kill Town right now.
03:26:49 I learned to mine sweeper just so I could kill rowdies.
03:26:56 Is that gonna be a nerd?
03:26:57 I have 20 million slime right now.
03:26:59 I'm aiming for 30 million.
03:27:01 Damn, this guy's actually playing the game.
03:27:02 I actually learned how to play mine sweeper properly.
03:27:06 This guy's mining.
03:27:07 Just so I could do this.
03:27:09 Does that make me like an idiot?
03:27:11 Yeah.
03:27:12 Does it make me like a nerd or something?
03:27:13 Yeah, definitely.
03:27:14 Or what?
03:27:15 But, you know, the base kind of idiot.
03:27:17 This is the petty that I learned to skill
03:27:18 just to focus on other people?
03:27:20 No.
03:27:22 Also, bullying Ben because I'm a killer and I have to.
03:27:27 He's struggling.
03:27:29 Ben, you got wet willies in class
03:27:33 and you didn't even tell the teacher
03:27:34 because you were so scared of stepping into the class.
03:27:38 It's true.
03:27:38 You just let it happen.
03:27:39 It's true.
03:27:40 You got an ear infection and it really hurt
03:27:43 and you still don't do anything about it.
03:27:45 How'd you know about that?
03:27:46 Fuck you.
03:27:47 That's Ben now.
03:27:48 Okay.
03:27:49 You too have a good podcast.
03:27:51 Bye.
03:27:51 And if there's a guest, you also have fun.
03:27:53 Bye.
03:27:54 Well, deadly.
03:27:55 Oh, wow.
03:27:56 I was expecting that.
03:27:58 He wished you have a good podcast.
03:28:02 His wish came true.
03:28:03 Yay.
03:28:04 Yay.
03:28:06 This guy, you know, does it?
03:28:09 It's no, it's not dumb to learn new skill to fuck with people.
03:28:14 That's what you do in any.
03:28:15 That's what I do with Pokemon.
03:28:17 They go on showdown and I learned the skills.
03:28:19 I learned how to learn to type matchups and move sets
03:28:22 just so I could just so I could own noobs on showdown.
03:28:27 What are the reasons there to get good at something?
03:28:29 I can't.
03:28:30 I can't think of one.
03:28:32 Yeah, I get.
03:28:33 I guess just to.
03:28:35 I only draw Clarissa Gunsmoke so that I can take over Japan.
03:28:39 That's not true.
03:28:41 Colonize it.
03:28:42 We're colonizing, baby.
03:28:44 Yeah.
03:28:44 And what is colonizing if not pawning a bunch of noobs?
03:28:47 Did you see?
03:28:47 Did you see?
03:28:48 Did you see what Cameron the fucking, what's his name?
03:28:52 Um, Avatar man.
03:28:54 James Cameron.
03:28:55 Did you see what James Cameron,
03:28:56 did you see what James Cameron said about the Native Americans?
03:28:59 About the Lakota.
03:29:01 What did he say?
03:29:01 About the Lakota people.
03:29:02 He said like in an interview, he's it's so fucking amazing.
03:29:06 He said like, yeah, this story reminds me of like the Lakota
03:29:10 and how the Lakota were wiped out by like the white man.
03:29:13 And now like looking, looking at like how completely
03:29:17 their culture has been devastated and wiped out by that event.
03:29:20 You know, I think if they knew what would eventually become of them,
03:29:23 I think they would have fought a little harder than they did back then.
03:29:26 Like I think they would have tried harder if they'd known
03:29:28 they would get this fucked over by it.
03:29:30 What the fuck?
03:29:31 It's so, I know, like why the fuck, why the fuck would you say that?
03:29:36 I thought you were like here because you like liked Native peoples
03:29:40 and were like, hey, let's sort of adapt a story about them
03:29:44 into a cool movie.
03:29:45 Why would you say something so fucked up?
03:29:47 I thought it was going to, I was going to joke like,
03:29:49 oh, maybe they should have tried being blue
03:29:51 and then weird like gossip and say,
03:29:53 ooh, and like leave them alone.
03:29:54 That's probably what he thinks.
03:29:56 That's what he said.
03:29:57 I know I know that he's saying, I know that he's,
03:30:01 I know that like he's trying to express like a pro Native opinion there.
03:30:06 Like he wants, he wishes they had not been wiped out
03:30:08 and like, I guess that's cool, but come on.
03:30:11 They would have shown harder.
03:30:13 They should have fought harder.
03:30:14 Get out of here.
03:30:15 Jesus Christ.
03:30:16 What a clown.
03:30:18 Come on.
03:30:18 Come on.
03:30:19 That being said.
03:30:20 Come on, come on, Jimmy.
03:30:21 Come on, Jimmy.
03:30:22 Do a little better.
03:30:23 That being said, don't forget to catch Avatar Way of the Water
03:30:27 only in cinema right now.
03:30:29 Right.
03:30:30 I genuinely don't understand why like I'm seeing people
03:30:34 seeming like they're unironically hype for this movie.
03:30:36 I don't get it.
03:30:37 Yeah, I don't get it at all.
03:30:39 Are we being Morbius again?
03:30:40 Is this another Morbius?
03:30:42 I actually did see it.
03:30:43 I saw an early screening of it.
03:30:45 I got free tickets.
03:30:46 Why?
03:30:46 Is it like amazing or is it just like one of the movies?
03:30:49 Because I wanted to.
03:30:50 Because, because James Cameron's never misses
03:30:53 when it comes to film, when it comes to cinema.
03:30:56 I didn't like Avatar.
03:30:57 I didn't, yeah, I didn't really care.
03:30:58 I didn't care about it when I saw it.
03:31:00 I thought like the cultural thing with Avatar is like,
03:31:05 oh, such special effects.
03:31:07 And then because it wasn't like a very interesting story,
03:31:10 it sort of faded out of relevance.
03:31:12 And then he said, I'm going to make 100,000 more sequels.
03:31:15 And that was like a joke.
03:31:17 Like that was funny that he said he was going to do that.
03:31:20 And then the second movie comes out and people are loving it,
03:31:24 which I guess is.
03:31:24 It actually is better than the first one.
03:31:27 I'll tell you that much.
03:31:27 It actually is better.
03:31:29 I don't know.
03:31:29 I just think people did really love the first one.
03:31:32 Like people were like crazy about it for like a short while.
03:31:36 For that summer.
03:31:37 Yeah, like, yeah.
03:31:38 For that summer, of course.
03:31:39 I'm not specifying a percentage of the population,
03:31:42 but they were definitely,
03:31:44 but I just remember hearing people raving about it for like
03:31:47 a couple months and then everyone was just quiet.
03:31:50 It was like a big, it was like a big movie of the summer
03:31:52 of that year or whatever.
03:31:54 And that's cool.
03:31:54 It made a bunch of money, fair enough.
03:31:56 But yeah, nobody talks about it anymore.
03:31:58 And I don't, I thought it was it was sort of a joke.
03:32:01 And then, but then I see that they announced the sequel.
03:32:04 And I see all this unironic like, oh, James,
03:32:07 oh, the movies are back.
03:32:08 Oh, we're back, baby.
03:32:09 Like big blockbusters are back and I can't wait to go to the movie theater.
03:32:13 They're gonna get baby.
03:32:14 Why?
03:32:15 I don't get it.
03:32:16 Why not watch my dinner with Andre and talk about what a piece of shit
03:32:20 Wallace Sean is.
03:32:21 Like that's way more interesting in my opinion.
03:32:24 Because there's no blue people in that.
03:32:26 I hate.
03:32:27 There is.
03:32:27 There's a blue minotaur.
03:32:28 There's a blue minotaur.
03:32:31 There's a blue minotaur that Andre hallucinates when he's in church.
03:32:36 It's described in monologue.
03:32:39 Yeah, there's no special effects.
03:32:41 Yeah, but way the way of water is better than the first one.
03:32:45 I get this vibe watching because I saw it,
03:32:48 but I get this vibe that like I do want him to make all six of these.
03:32:53 Avatar movies.
03:32:55 Is that the plan six?
03:32:56 Yeah, six of them.
03:32:57 That's the plan.
03:32:58 And I get the vibe that by the sixth film,
03:33:01 they won't even like look the same as the first one.
03:33:03 Like what's ever going on in the first one will not matter in the sixth.
03:33:07 Haven't they like already filmed a bunch of them?
03:33:11 He's written the scripts all the way to part like five, I think.
03:33:14 And I think the rumor goes that the fifth one is like five hours long.
03:33:19 And the fucking executives like didn't have no notes
03:33:23 or didn't tell him to cut out anything out of the movie.
03:33:28 It's funny in like a like that you don't see that happening that much.
03:33:35 I guess he has the cloud.
03:33:36 I kind of would like to see it happen just because it's such so odd.
03:33:40 The movie kind of feels like like you ever written like a you ever like in your head.
03:33:45 And I feel like all like artists or storytellers have had this in their head
03:33:49 where they like written like a very long epic saga in their head.
03:33:53 And they're all like, yeah, I know I know at the beginning like part one is kind of
03:33:56 is going to be kind of boring compared to all the epic shit that happens in the middle.
03:34:01 But I have to go for part one to eventually get you to the to the kick ass shit in the middle.
03:34:06 That's like the vibe I'm getting from this series.
03:34:10 So was it going to be like the the first one they fly around so they're like
03:34:14 or maybe they're in the forest.
03:34:16 So it's like forest navi this one way of water.
03:34:18 Are they going to be like dirt like mole navi in one of them?
03:34:22 Well, well, maybe I feel like the slime and navi in the swamp.
03:34:27 They're going to be swamp level in the third one.
03:34:28 They're going to go like full magic.
03:34:30 There's like some fucking magic shit happening in the second one.
03:34:33 They're going to make it.
03:34:34 It's going to become World of Warcraft.
03:34:37 That'd be cool.
03:34:39 But it's the well of life.
03:34:41 I also like how like casually they drop like sci-fi concepts throughout the film.
03:34:46 Like, do you remember the bad guy in the first movie?
03:34:49 There was like that white military guy.
03:34:51 The guy who's like, we got to get that unobtainium.
03:34:54 Yeah, yeah, that guy.
03:34:55 So so he comes back, actually.
03:34:59 Because even though he died, he comes back because they put his memories into a navi
03:35:06 like clone body that they made for him.
03:35:09 So that's how he comes back, right?
03:35:11 And there's this kind of there's this like fucking very interesting scene where like
03:35:16 they go to the site where his old body died and he picks up like his own skull.
03:35:20 He's like looking at it.
03:35:21 And it's like it's crazy how good the fuck.
03:35:24 And that's another thing that's great about the film.
03:35:26 It's crazy how good the fucking CGI is and how much like they fucking like emote.
03:35:30 Just like you really like and a lot of other things like you don't get like a good
03:35:35 performance out of people who are completely CGI.
03:35:37 But with like with the Avatar movies, like you really like feel the fucking range
03:35:42 coming out of these actors for these.
03:35:44 I mean, it's a digital.
03:35:46 So yeah, they usually are the fucking goats of anything CGI.
03:35:52 Yeah, I think also to I get the vibe that like if it is kind of an element,
03:35:58 it is kind of a meme to be like, oh, this is a masterpiece.
03:36:01 It is kind of it's like half that.
03:36:03 But the other half is kind of like, when was the last time we got like a home grown
03:36:07 like franchise series that isn't based on like preexisting media, you know?
03:36:13 Yeah, like all the MCU is built on like crutches.
03:36:18 And each each movie feels like factory made.
03:36:21 It's like you're eating a bag of chips every time you watch an MCU movie.
03:36:26 But with Avatar, it feels like this is just one like millionaires crazy.
03:36:31 Like in an alternate universe, Avatar would have been some sort of like sci-fi series,
03:36:35 like a sci-fi book series like made in the 90s.
03:36:38 But in our universe, it's like, oh, this crazy like millionaire director who has like.
03:36:43 Yeah, the guy who made Titanic and made so much money off of that that you could do
03:36:47 whatever he wanted, had an idea that would have otherwise been a smaller scale project.
03:36:54 Yeah, I get it.
03:36:55 Like people say the story about like, like people say that bullshit story about like George Lucas
03:37:00 being like, oh, yeah, he wrote all the Star Wars out and he knew he knew he only had like
03:37:05 enough funds to start in the middle with with with a new hope.
03:37:09 Which is nobody does anyone actually believe.
03:37:11 Yeah, I met people.
03:37:12 I met people who say that I met people who want to ironically say that shit.
03:37:15 Believe me, I've met motherfuckers.
03:37:17 So so but this this avatar feels like that.
03:37:21 But like real like, no, this is the guy actually did that.
03:37:25 Yeah, which is why like he waited so fucking long because he was like out there charting.
03:37:30 And then he does like real life, like real crazy shit, you know,
03:37:34 he's kind of like James Cameron is kind of like over to compare him to a fictional character.
03:37:37 He's kind of like Kaiba from Yu-Gi-Oh.
03:37:42 Have you read that post about how like Kaiba is like the most real depiction of a billionaire?
03:37:48 It's a time where it becomes that's what I kind of mean.
03:37:51 Like he becomes obsessed with that.
03:37:52 I know that we'll post you're talking about the other.
03:37:54 Yeah, the one that's like the thing about Kaiba is realistic depiction of a billionaire
03:37:58 because he his literally his whole thing is that he has all this money and he could do anything with
03:38:05 it. He could help the poor.
03:38:06 He could like he could do, you know, make space travel.
03:38:09 He could, you know, reinvent, you know, healthcare or whatever.
03:38:12 But he just chooses to spend it all on ridiculous hologram technology designed for playing card
03:38:18 games because he just loves card games that much.
03:38:21 He's just he's shaping the whole culture of his world with his massive wealth around building
03:38:25 all this technological infrastructure devised to facilitate the playing of children's card games
03:38:31 because that's just what he likes.
03:38:33 And he's just going to fucking do it and no one can tell him he can't.
03:38:37 Yeah, that's James Cameron with this series.
03:38:41 Amazing.
03:38:42 And I think I was going to say all the like critiques people have about like the the the
03:38:47 movie like oh it's white saviorism blah blah blah all this stuff.
03:38:51 I agree with it.
03:38:52 I think yeah yeah like if you give me like a take that's like that I'll agree with it.
03:38:55 That being said, I think the one thing that makes me like not hate the series for that
03:39:00 is because it doesn't feel like malicious.
03:39:03 You know, like it doesn't feel like he's he's making a statement about oh yeah,
03:39:06 this you know why people do it better like no that just kind of like accidental.
03:39:12 Well, yeah, yeah, I'm I'm sure that Cameron has like all the it seems like he at least has
03:39:19 like his heart in the right place with like he wants to show these like you know indigenous
03:39:24 people as like you know good and like they should be there.
03:39:29 You know, they're the heroes of the movie that you're supposed to root for them in there.
03:39:32 I and I think I think another funny thing is that the movie has like five different degrees of like
03:39:39 race mixing in the movie because it's like okay.
03:39:43 So like Jake Sully, he's like he was human and at the end of avatar they fully put his like
03:39:48 mind inside his avatar body, right?
03:39:50 So he's like completely Navi, right?
03:39:53 Yeah.
03:39:53 And he but also his his like Navi his Navi body was also it has some of his like DNA in it
03:40:00 because that's like it's his brother's DNA, right?
03:40:03 Like yeah, yeah, out of his brother.
03:40:04 Yeah.
03:40:05 Yeah.
03:40:05 Yeah.
03:40:05 So so he has he has a little bit of human in him.
03:40:09 So when he has kids with Zoa Sildana's like Navi,
03:40:15 their kids like look like their face look like Navi, but they have an extra finger like a human.
03:40:21 Right.
03:40:22 And then later there and then also in their family, the Sigourney, I don't know if you remember
03:40:28 the Sigourney Weaver character from the first one.
03:40:30 She was like a scientist.
03:40:31 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:40:32 She she at the end of avatar one, like it shows that she's like dying.
03:40:37 So they put her mind in her Navi body like right at the end.
03:40:41 And then in the sequel, it turns out that it worked but it put her Navi body in a coma, right?
03:40:47 So she's been in a coma this whole time.
03:40:50 But in her coma, she was pregnant in her Navi body and they don't know they don't know how
03:40:56 the pregnancy happened.
03:40:57 They assume it's like fucking magic or something and her daughter and she has like a daughter.
03:41:02 She has like a Navi daughter out of her like Navi body, right?
03:41:06 But the thing that's kind of interesting, the thing that's kind of interesting is that her
03:41:09 Navi daughter, her face, like she doesn't have like that flat like cat nose that all the Navis
03:41:15 has.
03:41:15 She has like a human nose, but she's like still blue and everything, right?
03:41:18 So this is like, so this is like a different degree of mixed race than like a jake-like-
03:41:23 Did like a human impregnate her mostly Navi, like the human body?
03:41:28 That's like, that's like, they don't know.
03:41:30 It's never explained in the movie, but that's like, I guess one of the mysteries.
03:41:34 And later it's showing that her daughter has like a weird magical ability, right?
03:41:39 Like she like later it's revealed that she doesn't need to like connect her like little ponytail
03:41:45 to other animals to like control it.
03:41:47 She could just do it.
03:41:48 Like she has like a psychic ability to do it.
03:41:50 Right?
03:41:51 And it's like connected to like the world tree that connects like her whole planet, right?
03:41:55 And then another thing is that it turns out that after the war, after the war in the first movie,
03:42:01 there was like still like a baby human there left on that planet that they were raising.
03:42:05 And they couldn't, they couldn't send that baby human back to Earth because you should,
03:42:09 you're, you can't put babies in cryostasis.
03:42:13 That's not, that's not good for a fucking baby.
03:42:15 I think that makes, that makes sense.
03:42:16 Right.
03:42:17 So, so the baby is, wait, hold up.
03:42:18 The baby is raised on Pandora and the baby is raised with a bunch of Navi, right?
03:42:23 And he's like a human like, he's like a human white boy with dreadlocks and his name is spider.
03:42:28 That's like his fucking name.
03:42:30 Right?
03:42:30 That's it.
03:42:31 It's all these weird degrees of like fucking like race, race.
03:42:35 Yeah.
03:42:35 Cause they also have a friend who's like, he's like, he's like,
03:42:38 he shaped like a ball and he's bright green.
03:42:41 In the new one?
03:42:43 Yeah.
03:42:44 He's literally like, he's like a circle.
03:42:45 He's like got a circle.
03:42:46 He's got like a spherical body.
03:42:48 He's bright green.
03:42:49 Oh, wait.
03:42:50 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:42:50 Oh, wait.
03:42:51 I get it.
03:42:52 It's just like.
03:42:53 Yeah.
03:42:54 Oh, I love Avatar actually.
03:42:57 Actually Avatar based.
03:42:59 All right.
03:43:00 Look at that CGI of it.
03:43:02 And that's like everything I explained is only like one fifth of the film.
03:43:06 Dude, I can't believe they make whole movies in the computer now.
03:43:11 Should we move, go to the next voicemail?
03:43:12 Next, next voice fail is an image.
03:43:15 Did you say voice fail?
03:43:16 Yeah.
03:43:17 Oh, I mean, voice fail.
03:43:20 It is image here.
03:43:22 And this is, I think, I think this is true as hell.
03:43:27 I wish that my computer worked.
03:43:29 I hope that it will load.
03:43:32 Well, I'll describe it for the, the people who aren't looking,
03:43:36 such as Ben St.
03:43:39 Ben St.
03:43:40 tears off the calendar for December 2022.
03:43:43 Underneath January 1984.
03:43:46 The woman is me.
03:43:48 I've got my name Gib on my shirt.
03:43:50 And I'm saying, whoa, they edited Munchie to look like a Nazi.
03:43:54 We can't show this on screen.
03:43:58 And it's true.
03:44:00 That's what I said.
03:44:01 That is what you said.
03:44:03 And I said, oh, no, political.
03:44:06 It's 1984.
03:44:07 This is 1984.
03:44:09 That's right.
03:44:10 Okay.
03:44:11 That seems true.
03:44:12 It seems true to life.
03:44:14 I can't see it.
03:44:16 You can't see it, but I can imagine it crystal clear.
03:44:19 Show me the next one.
03:44:21 Next one is, why do you, it's just a no, no voice.
03:44:25 Just a question.
03:44:26 Why do you act like a maniac on Twitter?
03:44:29 I assume they're talking to you, Ben.
03:44:31 What do I act like?
03:44:32 How do I act like a maniac?
03:44:34 I don't know.
03:44:36 I'm not, I'm just, I'm just mean to people that I don't like.
03:44:39 That's normal.
03:44:40 That's normal.
03:44:41 That's a normal thing to do.
03:44:42 You attack innocent YouTubers like you name a source.
03:44:45 I'm normal.
03:44:45 I'm the only normal one.
03:44:46 If you think I'm the maniac, that means there's something wrong with you.
03:44:49 I'm sorry.
03:44:50 I'm sorry, but you have to get a grip.
03:44:53 You have to get a grip, my dude.
03:44:55 Did a Stereo's Coconut compliment you on being a maniac on Twitter?
03:44:59 Like you said, that's what he liked about you.
03:45:01 He did.
03:45:03 I think he was just being nice.
03:45:05 I think he, I think, I think he was being, I think he was being diplomatic.
03:45:11 Nice.
03:45:12 Which I'll take it, you know.
03:45:15 How do you?
03:45:18 I hope people watch that stream I was on with the Stereo's because that was actually really fun.
03:45:21 I was really funny.
03:45:22 It was actually really fun explaining to him like what Channel Awesome was.
03:45:28 Oh, yeah, I haven't got around to watching that.
03:45:31 All the other kids in that stream, they like,
03:45:33 they didn't, they didn't like explain to him like actually what it was.
03:45:36 They would tell him like, oh, yeah, this person got canceled for being a rapist.
03:45:39 Oh, yeah, this person died.
03:45:41 And he was like confused.
03:45:43 And then I explained like, here's the deal.
03:45:45 Here was like the corporate structure hierarchy and how it became this like,
03:45:49 this, this enterprise built of like Doug, Doug Walker clones.
03:45:53 And he was like, oh, thank you.
03:45:55 Now I get why it's funny.
03:45:57 That's, but that's kind of like, like a Stereo's fault.
03:46:01 Not going to lie.
03:46:01 Because he's, he's, he's a magnet for people who, because, because here's the bit.
03:46:06 Let me, if you ever listen to like them, I've listened to a lot of like a Stereo's podcast
03:46:10 and usually the gimmick is the same across the board is that a Stereo's is a boomer
03:46:16 and he does it like, like edgy things and his co-host would be super edgy and we'll
03:46:20 tell him a bunch of edgy things.
03:46:21 And the Stereo's would be like, oh my God.
03:46:24 I see.
03:46:24 And that's every, that's every a Stereo's podcast.
03:46:26 So, so because of that, his fan base is a bunch of edgy people who just jumped
03:46:31 the calls and tell him like, Stereo's, you heard about this super edgy thing and he'll
03:46:35 be like, oh my God.
03:46:36 Ah, that's, that's his fucking gimmick.
03:46:39 Oh, I killed him.
03:46:42 Oh no, Ben's dead.
03:46:43 Ben's dead.
03:46:44 Is he finally got the best of him?
03:46:46 Ben's dead, baby.
03:46:48 I hope Ben is talking into his recording right now and that we're all talking over each other
03:46:53 in the edit.
03:46:54 Ben Stain has turned it to Ben Angel.
03:46:56 I'm going to post the next thing because it's the homo Juneus.
03:47:04 Yeah, I got the file in the chat so that Ben can listen to it when he gets back,
03:47:08 maybe if he's lucky.
03:47:11 Rest in peace, Ben.
03:47:14 We barely knew ye.
03:47:17 I'm, I'm back.
03:47:18 Sorry, I'm back.
03:47:19 My discord dropped the call.
03:47:22 I got the, I got the image to load.
03:47:24 I look, look at my hair.
03:47:26 I look like fucking, uh, I have like fucking Jerry Seinfeld like Kramer high hair.
03:47:30 You do.
03:47:31 It's a very funny, I looked so, I look so bad at red, the red con two videos.
03:47:36 What's the deal with Munchy?
03:47:38 He, they say he's a Nazi, but I did not see what they're saying.
03:47:46 I'm like, you know, it's Gib, you're saying we can't show this on screen and I'm tearing
03:47:51 the cover.
03:47:51 I'm tearing the calendar to 1984, but I'm smiling about it.
03:47:54 Like, I'm not concerned.
03:47:55 Like, like the original boomer.
03:47:57 Oh, you like Lantilator 4.
03:47:58 I'm like, yeah, time to go back, baby.
03:48:01 We have to go back, returned to 1984.
03:48:05 Cool.
03:48:07 Uh, let's, let's do the next one.
03:48:09 And next one is a vocary link.
03:48:11 Oh, okay.
03:48:11 Can you hear that?
03:48:13 Yes, I can.
03:48:15 Okay.
03:48:16 Three, two, one, go.
03:48:20 Oh, I swim in the ocean.
03:48:25 Swimming is all I know how to do.
03:48:29 Below me is water.
03:48:31 Next to me is water.
03:48:32 It's the way of water.
03:48:33 In front of me is water.
03:48:36 Behind me is water.
03:48:38 This isn't like a clip from the film.
03:48:40 If I dive down, it's more water.
03:48:41 Yeah, I've never seen.
03:48:42 If I swim up, it's more water.
03:48:47 I'm not having sex with you right now, water.
03:48:51 It's all very homogenous.
03:49:00 I don't know why the way you said it that time got me.
03:49:04 I don't know who this guy is, but I love him.
03:49:06 He, he's pretty homogenous.
03:49:09 He's very.
03:49:09 Yeah, his, his voicemails are getting a little homogenous.
03:49:12 They're all about the same thing.
03:49:13 Yeah, they are a little bit like they all have the same structure
03:49:16 and they all end the same way.
03:49:17 I wonder where this is going.
03:49:18 I don't understand.
03:49:18 Doesn't make any.
03:49:20 Sounds a little disturbed.
03:49:22 Australian.
03:49:23 Is that just me?
03:49:24 A little Australian.
03:49:27 Australian.
03:49:27 He's a little alien.
03:49:30 The next voicemail is another one of these.
03:49:33 These high things.
03:49:35 As you can see, Ben Stain's channel is very complex.
03:49:38 There's a lot of interweaving fiends.
03:49:41 I like on the Mega Man lecture, every single Mega Man on the board.
03:49:45 He's a little arrow.
03:49:48 That's pretty good.
03:49:50 I should say this is a low quality JPEG, so that it loads for you, Ben.
03:49:54 I totally forgot about the Ben St. debate.
03:49:56 Digibro on Bernie.
03:49:58 What happened to that guy?
03:50:00 Digibro?
03:50:01 Yeah.
03:50:03 He became, he died.
03:50:05 He died.
03:50:06 No, he became, he became May.
03:50:09 Nice.
03:50:09 He's gone.
03:50:10 Yeah.
03:50:11 He became May.
03:50:12 They became pregnant with the child of the, of the gunk.
03:50:16 And it, and the title was passed on through the bloodline.
03:50:19 My God, how old is that baby now?
03:50:22 Almost, must be less than a year.
03:50:24 Is it only been, okay.
03:50:28 I know how this works is like, oh, a family member has a baby,
03:50:31 and then before you know it, they're like seven.
03:50:33 Next time you see them, yeah.
03:50:35 Before you know it, I think that's a podcast.
03:50:37 That's how I am with all my stupid little second cousins now.
03:50:40 They're all turning like, one of them's like five.
03:50:43 God, one of them's like five.
03:50:44 Holy shit.
03:50:45 And then, oh, I can see it.
03:50:47 Oh my God, I can see it.
03:50:48 Thank you.
03:50:48 That's how it worked.
03:50:50 Oh, all the, all the little Mega Man's.
03:50:53 Wait, what is, these are, and yeah, yeah.
03:50:57 See, this is, this is coherent.
03:50:59 This is coherent.
03:51:00 They're all looking at each other.
03:51:02 They're all, it's all connected in the great circle of life.
03:51:07 The only, the only tricky one is you and Mega Man are looking at the camera.
03:51:10 I don't know what the fuck to do there.
03:51:13 We're all, you do nothing.
03:51:15 All together, all of us together looking at the camera.
03:51:19 Some of these are, some of these, oh, Endless War looking at about is good.
03:51:25 I like him.
03:51:26 I like him there.
03:51:29 I should release more Endless War animation tie-ins that'll get 8K views.
03:51:36 It is a follow-up to my, to my, to my big hit.
03:51:40 Okay.
03:51:41 Yeah.
03:51:42 Next.
03:51:42 Well, it's a good, it's a good thing, I think, because it is actually my time to go now.
03:51:46 Oh, thank you for stopping by.
03:51:49 I'm glad I could stop by.
03:51:51 It's been good chatting.
03:51:54 All 10 words.
03:51:55 It's been good, all 10 words.
03:51:57 You silently eat suffering.
03:52:00 Well, we all spurge about, yeah.
03:52:04 We're eating good in the neighborhood.
03:52:09 And I got to go eat something I'm feeling faint.
03:52:11 Oh, okay.
03:52:12 Oh, no.
03:52:13 Yeah, we have, we have been, we have been going, we are, we had four hours now.
03:52:17 Oh my god.
03:52:19 Yeah, we just, we just passed the four hours mark.
03:52:22 So, well, if at any point you're done, you can say so and leave.
03:52:28 Well, how many more voicemails, how many voicemails do we have?
03:52:30 Well, we've been going slow.
03:52:31 There's like, actually, one, two, three, four.
03:52:36 There's like seven to 10.
03:52:39 Some of them are images.
03:52:41 Okay.
03:52:42 I mean, I may have to skip that.
03:52:44 Oh, I apologize.
03:52:45 That's no, that's totally okay.
03:52:47 This is a long time.
03:52:49 Yeah.
03:52:51 Well, I mean, thank you, Oblivion, for stopping by.
03:52:55 And Deadly, it's been a great having you as a guest.
03:52:58 And thank you.
03:53:00 You're welcome to come back any time.
03:53:01 That's true.
03:53:02 That's true.
03:53:03 Everyone, subscribe to Deadly Comics.
03:53:05 Watch all the animations.
03:53:06 Definitely.
03:53:06 Good.
03:53:07 Oh yeah, definitely everyone should.
03:53:08 I mean, if that wasn't clear by the fact that he's here,
03:53:12 you should definitely check out his animation.
03:53:13 But don't promote him on YouTube.
03:53:14 You might get banned.
03:53:15 That might be illegal next week.
03:53:16 On Twitter, if you mention that you have his YouTube channel,
03:53:19 you will get banned.
03:53:21 Yeah, just write my name on a paper and leave it in the public place.
03:53:28 That's how we get the word out.
03:53:29 They can't stop all of us from doing that.
03:53:34 They can only take some of us down.
03:53:37 Exactly.
03:53:38 They can.
03:53:39 I'm heading out.
03:53:40 All right.
03:53:40 Thanks.
03:53:41 We'll leave me on for a little bit.
03:53:42 Thank you.
03:53:43 See ya.
03:53:44 See ya.
03:53:45 See ya.
03:53:46 Cool.
03:53:46 See you guys as well.
03:53:47 All right.
03:53:48 See ya, Deadly.
03:53:49 Thanks again.
03:53:50 Bye-bye.
03:53:50 Thanks for having me on.
03:53:52 All right.
03:53:52 My pleasure.
03:53:53 Later.
03:53:53 See ya.
03:53:54 Bye-bye.
03:53:55 All right.
03:53:56 Well, let's wrap this up.
03:54:00 Okay.
03:54:00 Next ones are Ben's Weekly Reminder.
03:54:03 Played Delta in Chapter 2.
03:54:06 And to catch up on One Piece,
03:54:08 and then they sent another one said,
03:54:09 I meant to stay up to date with One Piece.
03:54:12 They're all non-voicemails.
03:54:14 Gotcha.
03:54:17 The one after that is this.
03:54:20 Just says Ben.
03:54:22 Okay.
03:54:23 Okay.
03:54:23 Okay.
03:54:24 Three, two, one, go.
03:54:26 Ben, I'm driving Ben.
03:54:28 I'm driving beyond the speed limit, Ben.
03:54:31 Ben, I'm breaking the law.
03:54:34 No.
03:54:36 Why are you telling me?
03:54:38 That was me last night.
03:54:39 Was it actually?
03:54:41 No.
03:54:41 No, that wasn't me.
03:54:43 But I was, I speed all the fucking time.
03:54:47 I mean, I think a lot of people do.
03:54:49 I think it's, I mean, like,
03:54:51 I mean, they're speeding and then they're speeding.
03:54:54 I only go like 20 miles over the speed limit, you know?
03:54:58 I mean, on the highway, that's normal.
03:55:01 Yeah, exactly.
03:55:03 And you know, and if there's a cop, I'll stop on stop sign.
03:55:06 But if there's no cop, I'll stop.
03:55:08 By crashing into them.
03:55:09 And there's no cop, no stop.
03:55:11 You know what I'm saying?
03:55:13 You never know.
03:55:14 You never know when there's a cop,
03:55:16 because they hide.
03:55:17 I know.
03:55:18 Hide sneakily.
03:55:19 And they'll sneakily try and get you.
03:55:21 In my six years of driving, I've only been stopped twice.
03:55:28 Yeah, I mean.
03:55:30 Both unrelated to speed.
03:55:32 I'm not telling you.
03:55:33 I'm not telling you how to drive.
03:55:35 Yeah, I mean, I speed on the highway.
03:55:38 I think everyone speeds on the highway.
03:55:41 You come to California out and come in my car.
03:55:44 I'll definitely be speeding.
03:55:47 You'll feel the wind.
03:55:51 It'll be the last thing you ever feel.
03:55:54 The next one is called, you know that one.
03:55:58 Okay, hang on.
03:55:59 It is downloading.
03:56:00 Okay, I'm ready.
03:56:02 Three, two, one, go.
03:56:06 I'm so dumb.
03:56:08 I'm so dumb.
03:56:10 Anyways, whenever you meet again,
03:56:13 can you take a picture of doing the soy jacks
03:56:16 pointing backwards in the face for?
03:56:21 That would be funny.
03:56:24 We should have done that when you visited.
03:56:29 Did you hear the voicemail?
03:56:31 Sorry, I got food delivered.
03:56:35 It's soy jacks pointing.
03:56:36 He just wanted us to do the meme
03:56:38 where we both point behind us.
03:56:41 Here we go.
03:56:42 Soy.
03:56:43 I don't know.
03:56:44 I would do it.
03:56:46 It is a funny idea.
03:56:47 We should have done it.
03:56:48 It's a missed opportunity.
03:56:51 I actually look like the guy now.
03:56:52 I look like the guy, not the real one in the picture,
03:56:58 but the drawn version that's bald and has a beard.
03:57:01 Like that's just what I look like now.
03:57:03 You should do that.
03:57:04 But you guys do the pose,
03:57:05 but you're guys are in front of Trixie's house.
03:57:08 In front of her like address.
03:57:13 Stalking.
03:57:14 Like, oh, we found her.
03:57:16 And then we do the faces like out on the street
03:57:20 looking at the house.
03:57:21 And then another one like in front of her front door.
03:57:24 And then another one like with the door open,
03:57:26 like pointing inside the house as like the people inside
03:57:29 are like, what?
03:57:30 They're like scared that we're like breaking in.
03:57:32 And then another one like on top of Trixie,
03:57:36 like duct tape and like tied up and hog tied.
03:57:38 We were like, oh, holding her behind us.
03:57:40 We just point to her, make the face.
03:57:42 And then the final one is us like over like an unmarked gray.
03:57:46 He was just like pointing back behind us.
03:57:48 Like, oh, so we did it.
03:57:54 This is my fantasy.
03:57:56 I think it'd be funny for the first one
03:57:57 when you guys are pointing to the front of her house.
03:57:59 She's coming outside just like that one picture of boogie
03:58:01 with the gun.
03:58:06 Or it could be Riley with the gun
03:58:08 because he's like fat enough.
03:58:10 Yeah, Riley.
03:58:12 That would be a fun photo shoot
03:58:13 if it weren't so actually dangerous.
03:58:16 Yeah, if it weren't, if it were,
03:58:18 if we could do it without like actually
03:58:20 He's about to introduce you to a big having connection right now.
03:58:24 If we could, if we could, if we just,
03:58:27 if we just happened to be there,
03:58:30 and like we knew that like no one would see us
03:58:32 and like we knew that like nothing was going to happen
03:58:35 and we could just do it just for funny.
03:58:36 It would be funny to pose in front of the house
03:58:38 just like, oh, we did it.
03:58:41 We made the pilgrimage.
03:58:44 But no, I wouldn't,
03:58:45 if I actually did it, it would be bizarre
03:58:48 and I would be rightfully shamed for it.
03:58:50 LaMau.
03:58:51 Smash cut to Ben doing it.
03:58:52 Smash cut to me being rightfully shamed for it.
03:58:55 Yeah, true.
03:58:59 Okay, how many more?
03:59:01 We must be getting down there.
03:59:02 There's like one, two, three, four, five, six more.
03:59:07 Seven more.
03:59:08 This one is a, what is this?
03:59:09 You said there were seven more.
03:59:11 Okay.
03:59:11 Seven to 10.
03:59:12 I wasn't, I did, I glanced at it.
03:59:14 What is this?
03:59:15 Fast upload something, something slash file.
03:59:19 I don't know what this is.
03:59:21 It's not loading for me.
03:59:25 I'll post the link in case somebody else can see it.
03:59:30 But I can't.
03:59:31 I mean, I think it's pretty unlikely
03:59:34 that it's going to work for me.
03:59:36 It's, it doesn't download anything for you.
03:59:40 No, there's no page.
03:59:40 It's not, oh, connection timed out.
03:59:43 Error code.
03:59:44 Okay.
03:59:44 That's not working.
03:59:47 Yeah.
03:59:48 Sorry, fast uploader.
03:59:51 That's too bad.
03:59:52 Let me try it one more time.
03:59:54 No, it's not letting.
03:59:55 Oh, that's unfortunate.
03:59:57 I wonder what it could have been.
04:00:01 Cheesy, you get anything?
04:00:04 Um, like fast upload.
04:00:09 Nah, this is.
04:00:11 No, no, well, ah, well.
04:00:17 The next one is a one piece chapters.com slash something,
04:00:20 something, and it's a link to one piece scans.
04:00:27 Okay.
04:00:28 Why?
04:00:29 Um, maybe it's the preferred scan.
04:00:31 It does look very good actually.
04:00:33 TCB scans.
04:00:38 There was a voicemail, but it's not loading for me.
04:00:40 Uh, yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll just post it.
04:00:42 It's not loading.
04:00:44 The voicemail itself is like eight seconds long.
04:00:47 It's not loading.
04:00:47 So I don't know whether it's relevant.
04:00:50 Okay.
04:00:50 He says he recommends reading one piece through,
04:00:54 yeah, this, this website or a vis media,
04:00:57 the scan quality and the translations are better.
04:01:01 Understood.
04:01:02 This does look very good.
04:01:04 Uh, well, maybe I will use this going forward then.
04:01:09 Okay.
04:01:09 The next one, next voicemail is another image.
04:01:14 Okay.
04:01:16 Oh, all right.
04:01:17 That's interesting.
04:01:19 Great.
04:01:19 Oh, this is how they're, this is how they're like seeing your
04:01:22 profile picture.
04:01:23 They think it's a beak with a beard.
04:01:26 Well, it's not a beak.
04:01:27 Huh.
04:01:28 It's your, that's, that's your ear thing.
04:01:32 Uh, I can see it though.
04:01:34 Oh, kind of.
04:01:40 Yeah.
04:01:40 I mean, okay.
04:01:43 Oh, okay.
04:01:45 Oh, that one.
04:01:45 I thought you meant your profile picture on discord.
04:01:48 I was about to say that looks.
04:01:49 No, no, it's an older one, older profile.
04:01:52 Well, this, well, this is what I still use on Twitter.
04:01:55 Oh, yeah.
04:01:56 Yeah.
04:01:57 Um, hmm.
04:01:58 Okay.
04:01:59 Yeah, I kind of see it if you, if you read the ear as a beak.
04:02:02 Sure.
04:02:03 Neat.
04:02:04 Funny.
04:02:05 Uh, lol.
04:02:08 Yeah.
04:02:11 Maybe I'll redesign.
04:02:13 So I should read, redesign,
04:02:15 reploid me to look like this.
04:02:18 I'll give him a name.
04:02:19 Why don't you use your profile for this one?
04:02:22 His name would be like, his name would be like
04:02:26 slime, slime corvid.
04:02:30 That's pretty good.
04:02:31 That's not bad.
04:02:32 That's pretty good.
04:02:32 That's pretty good.
04:02:32 You can, we can, we can workshop it.
04:02:34 Not slime, swan.
04:02:37 Well, does that look, does that look like a swan to you?
04:02:40 Does any of the fucking animals look like they're animals?
04:02:42 Looks like a furby with a beard.
04:02:44 They never do.
04:02:45 Sometimes chill penguin looks like a penguin.
04:02:47 Yeah.
04:02:48 That's, it's not an apartment.
04:02:50 It's not a fucking apartment really.
04:02:52 I mean, storm.
04:02:53 I mean, like, it's like most, most of the time.
04:02:56 Never played any of the Mega Man X games.
04:02:59 Most of the time they are recognizably.
04:03:02 Okay.
04:03:02 For confidence, I will say that they look,
04:03:04 they don't look like animals.
04:03:06 Sometimes they're a little iffy.
04:03:08 Sometimes they're a little iffy.
04:03:09 It's true.
04:03:11 Slime.
04:03:11 She's a cat.
04:03:12 Slime swallow.
04:03:13 Yeah, I have a cat.
04:03:14 I heard a cat.
04:03:15 Yeah, he's a, he's a little guy.
04:03:17 He's a little guy.
04:03:17 His name is spooky.
04:03:18 Oh yeah.
04:03:20 Poopy.
04:03:21 Spooky.
04:03:22 Poopy's on the strip.
04:03:23 No, shut up.
04:03:23 Stop.
04:03:24 Stop bullying me.
04:03:24 Stop bullying me right now.
04:03:26 Poopy's on the strip.
04:03:27 No, no, you're wrong.
04:03:29 We all hung out at Poopy's on the strip.
04:03:31 All right.
04:03:32 I'll, I'll post a picture of him.
04:03:34 Because he's a, he's, he's quite a little fella.
04:03:36 And he's, he's got like.
04:03:38 It's the next voicemail.
04:03:40 Guys, be honest with me.
04:03:40 Is this the worst podcast episode ever?
04:03:43 Or is it the best?
04:03:45 It's one or the other?
04:03:47 Uh, why would it be the worst?
04:03:49 Because it's long.
04:03:51 No, that's what they like.
04:03:52 That is what they like.
04:03:53 They like it long.
04:03:54 For some reason.
04:03:55 These piggies love to eat their sloth.
04:03:56 They like taking a long,
04:03:58 they take, like taking a long hard podcast.
04:04:02 He's got a little sweater on.
04:04:04 Yeah, we got him a little gay sweater one time.
04:04:07 He's got a, he's got a gay little sweater.
04:04:09 Look at that little twink.
04:04:10 Look at that little twink base.
04:04:12 That little, that little fruity boy.
04:04:13 That fruity little queer mo.
04:04:16 That fruity little, he's so effeminate.
04:04:18 We all, we train him to be homophobic.
04:04:20 This is how people, this is how your cousin see you, Ben.
04:04:25 Oh, look at the little gay boy.
04:04:26 He's a little gay boy.
04:04:28 This gay little sweater.
04:04:28 Oh, he's in a little, oh, he's in a little sweater.
04:04:31 Oh, he's got a little shoes on.
04:04:36 Sad.
04:04:37 He's got a little gay little podcast.
04:04:40 Oh, he's got a little, oh, he put a little YouTube video.
04:04:42 Oh, he made a little ad revenue.
04:04:44 That's nice for him.
04:04:46 Sorry, I got, sorry.
04:04:46 I got to go do renovations on my house that I own.
04:04:49 Sorry, I got to go, I got to go arrest my tenant
04:04:52 and give him over to the police.
04:04:54 All right, bye.
04:04:57 Damn, I'm just jealous.
04:04:59 You know what?
04:05:00 I'm just, I'm just hating because I'm jealous.
04:05:05 Anyway, next voicemail.
04:05:06 Good thing you said.
04:05:08 Next, next voicemail is do it.
04:05:10 Good thing I said it so that nobody else can say it about me.
04:05:14 Did you post it?
04:05:15 I posted it just above the, it was above the cat image.
04:05:17 Oh, right.
04:05:19 Okay, three, two, one, go.
04:05:23 Please, please, please, Pokemon Park.
04:05:29 It's so fun.
04:05:31 Thank you, my big friends.
04:05:34 Pokemon Park.
04:05:36 What is that?
04:05:36 I believe it is that.
04:05:37 Is that a Switch game?
04:05:40 It's the one with like the Pokemon, like little wind up toys.
04:05:44 Wait, is it?
04:05:46 It's a theme park.
04:05:47 Pokemon Park?
04:05:48 No, wait.
04:05:50 What is Pokemon Park?
04:05:52 Can you hear my Google bit?
04:05:54 He also called it Pokemon Ranger.
04:05:57 No, I do not hear the cat purring.
04:05:59 Thank you very much.
04:06:00 And I would not like to.
04:06:02 Do not let me hear that cat purring.
04:06:04 Don't let that fucking cat purring.
04:06:06 There will be hell to pay.
04:06:09 What you gonna do?
04:06:10 You can't do nothing.
04:06:11 You're in Boston, bitch.
04:06:13 Okay, Pokemon Ranger is an action role-playing video game.
04:06:20 Oh, God.
04:06:25 It is radically different from the traditional Pokemon RPGs.
04:06:29 You control a Ranger in the Fiore region and catch Pokemon
04:06:32 by using a device called the Capture Styler,
04:06:35 which is controlled by the stylus.
04:06:37 The storyline of the game is set out in 10 main missions.
04:06:40 The only Pokemon that you have a Minon or a Plussel as your companion.
04:06:47 Wow, okay.
04:06:49 So it's completely different.
04:06:51 That's kind of interesting.
04:06:54 Is it good?
04:06:55 This guy seems to think it's good.
04:06:58 I guess we'll get back to you on that.
04:07:02 Might take a look at it, perhaps.
04:07:06 Okay, all right.
04:07:07 So you like circle man up the stylus.
04:07:11 There's a lot of dragons.
04:07:12 There's a lot of dragons on the cover.
04:07:14 The cover is Charizard.
04:07:16 There's Kingdra.
04:07:18 There's Flygon and Salamence.
04:07:23 Wow.
04:07:25 Okay, anyway, what's the next one?
04:07:28 Next one is called Nome Talk.
04:07:30 Okay, three, two, one, go.
04:07:35 Oh, yeah, Nome Talk.
04:07:37 My favorite ancient gnome, Nome Chomsky.
04:07:41 Nome Chomsky's ancient?
04:07:45 No, my favorite Asian gnome.
04:07:47 Oh, ancient gnome.
04:07:48 I think it will be.
04:07:52 For a while, I was hearing people talk about Nome Chomsky a lot.
04:07:55 Haven't really heard much about him in the last year or so.
04:07:58 I feel like he kind of became a little less relevant.
04:08:02 Is Nome Chomsky the guy who is like pro-Russia in the war thing?
04:08:12 I'm not sure.
04:08:13 Was he like a cool guy who went cringe?
04:08:15 I feel like there's an old man, cool guy who went cringe on Russia.
04:08:18 I think you might be thinking of the guy, yeah.
04:08:20 I think he's still cool, just that his oldness has caused him to say cringe things.
04:08:26 I'm not really sure what his Russia take is.
04:08:28 I know that he's a leftoid and was kind of a lib.
04:08:33 And I remember he was very pro-Biden.
04:08:35 People were disappointed that he was very enthusiastically like,
04:08:38 you need to vote for Biden if it's even like, yeah,
04:08:42 it's bad that they didn't let Bernie run.
04:08:45 But you need to vote for Biden because climate change is such an important issue,
04:08:50 which is true.
04:08:52 And then, yeah, I don't know what is Russia.
04:08:55 I think I might have heard someone say that he's anti-NATO.
04:08:58 He's anti-NATO.
04:08:59 Yeah, that's it.
04:09:00 I think he's pro-Russia in the sense that he's not pro-Ukraine in the war
04:09:05 and not pro-NATO.
04:09:07 And saying like, NATO caused Russia to, forced Russia to fight back.
04:09:13 And I'm like, eh.
04:09:14 Honestly, I mean maybe.
04:09:14 I've heard things that contradict that, so I don't know.
04:09:17 I have not, yeah, I don't really have, I can't really have a take on it.
04:09:21 There's like too much to that situation for me to even really be like,
04:09:26 I definitely disagree with that or not.
04:09:30 Next one?
04:09:31 Okay.
04:09:31 Next one is called white lander, but I misspelled it.
04:09:35 Who's lander?
04:09:37 Three, two, one, go.
04:09:39 I just wanted to point out how funny it was when you thought that Argentina meant
04:09:43 white land because there is a meme.
04:09:45 The Argentina is white meme, which is based on how many white supremacists there are in Argentina.
04:09:52 Which is kind of funny because, well, you know, we, all of the countries in South America are
04:09:58 mixed race mostly and over half of the population in Argentina are, you know, First Nation.
04:10:06 So it's kind of weird.
04:10:08 There is so many white nationalists in Argentina who think that Argentina is both
04:10:16 like Aryan white.
04:10:17 I don't know what the fuck they think, honestly.
04:10:20 But it's, it made me laugh.
04:10:22 So that, okay.
04:10:24 Yeah, that's, yeah, that's the meme.
04:10:25 A lot of like Nazis escaped to Argentina after World War II.
04:10:29 That's what I was going to say.
04:10:30 Isn't that, isn't it the case that a lot of like, a lot of like Nazi people were fleeing
04:10:35 like the Nuremberg trials after World War II and a bunch of like Nazi Germans like
04:10:39 fled to Argentina?
04:10:40 I've heard that before.
04:10:43 Lol.
04:10:43 Yeah.
04:10:44 Did they go there because they thought it was the white place?
04:10:47 I, I don't think so.
04:10:49 No, I think I think I've heard about the government being super friendly to white supremacists
04:10:55 because like after the Civil War, apparently like a bunch of Confederates like went down
04:11:00 to South America.
04:11:01 Confederates?
04:11:02 Yeah.
04:11:03 Oh, that's the American Civil War, right?
04:11:04 Yeah, American Civil War.
04:11:05 They went down there.
04:11:07 I don't know if Argentina, but like somewhere in South America, I know there's like a whole
04:11:12 town that's like a Confederate town.
04:11:15 Crazy.
04:11:16 I know that different, I know, I know different countries in South America have different like
04:11:21 sort of like like racial makeups and in some countries it's more like the divide between
04:11:26 like Caucasian people and colored people is like broader and more distinct than it is in others.
04:11:33 And yeah, I think I was kind of, I did think I'd heard that specifically about like
04:11:40 Germans fled to Argentina.
04:11:43 Yeah, we're seeing them.
04:11:45 Yeah.
04:11:46 You ever seen that invincible meme where it's like, the caption is like, when you're
04:11:53 Argentinian grandson goes up to you and asks you why is his last name German?
04:11:58 And it's like, it's fucking of the man from invincible.
04:12:03 And he's like, it's like that one scene where he has to always telling a mark about like the
04:12:08 true plan of like invading the human race.
04:12:11 But of the man is like edited to look like like an old German man.
04:12:16 I don't think I've seen that one.
04:12:17 And I probably wouldn't get it because I because I haven't seen invincible.
04:12:21 But I have.
04:12:22 I've seen like similar memes like like never ask never ask a man his what he makes never ask
04:12:28 a woman her age, never ask a white Argentinian like what his grandparents were doing during
04:12:33 World War Two or something like that.
04:12:37 Law.
04:12:38 Every time I think about Argentinians that like Nazis, that's the Argentinian.
04:12:43 I think of that one scene in X-Men first class where Magneto is in Argentina.
04:12:48 Any fucking murders, both of those Nazis with his power.
04:12:51 That scene was so badass.
04:12:53 Which which one was that?
04:12:54 Which I think that was X-Men first class.
04:12:58 Okay, I didn't see that one.
04:12:59 Yeah, that was like part of the new reboots.
04:13:01 They did a couple years ago.
04:13:03 Those went to like shit real quick.
04:13:06 Yeah.
04:13:09 I don't I watched the old I watched the old ones.
04:13:13 I think I saw the first two.
04:13:16 I saw the one where they break Magneto out by giving him a little bit of they put the iron in
04:13:21 that guy's blood.
04:13:22 Yeah, he sucks the iron out of his blood.
04:13:24 That was pretty good.
04:13:25 That scene was base.
04:13:26 I love my favorite scene in the first X-Men movie is like when Wolverine first meets all
04:13:31 the other X-Men and he like thinks that them having code names is so goofy.
04:13:36 Yeah, he goes up to Professor X and he's like, what do they call you wheels?
04:13:41 What do they call you?
04:13:42 Wheels.
04:13:43 Abelist.
04:13:44 Abelist.
04:13:45 He was born in the 17th century.
04:13:50 He doesn't know any better.
04:13:52 Is he that old?
04:13:53 Yeah, he's old.
04:13:54 He didn't know that.
04:13:55 I knew he was really old.
04:13:56 I knew he was really old.
04:13:56 I didn't know he was that old.
04:13:58 Oh, he was.
04:13:59 I had no idea.
04:14:00 I thought he was just a guy who's one day got like bones of steel.
04:14:04 I thought he might have been like a hundred because like I know he's like extremely long
04:14:08 lived because of his regenerative factor.
04:14:11 Oh, of course.
04:14:12 Yeah, like since the 17th century.
04:14:15 He's been around.
04:14:16 And he's short.
04:14:16 He's like he's like a short stocky king in the in the comics and they sort of they sort of
04:14:22 made him look like more normal.
04:14:24 They kind of race that in the movies.
04:14:26 Yeah, right.
04:14:27 But and in the cartoon too, in the cartoon, he just looks the same as everyone.
04:14:31 I got the same build as Cyclops and everything.
04:14:33 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
04:14:36 Yeah, he's been he's been around a while.
04:14:40 I think his I think his first appearance was in I think he first showed up in a whole comic
04:14:45 was when Wolverine first showed up.
04:14:50 Enough about Wolverine facts.
04:14:51 You guys want to go for the rest of the voicemail?
04:14:53 Let's do the next voicemail.
04:14:54 How many more?
04:14:54 We must have not many more to go.
04:14:56 This is the last one.
04:14:57 Nice.
04:14:58 Is the Vinnie comic.

04:15:22 I'm sorry.
04:15:23 I'm going to make a comic like this and make Ben and Gibb be like,
04:15:27 actually, cheesy royalty was a badass idea.
04:15:30 You should totally do that base.
04:15:32 I have a I have a funny feeling.
04:15:36 I have a feeling this one's going to be funny.
04:15:39 Okay, this guy recommended me on the anger too.
04:15:41 So you should look at this image.
04:15:44 That's pretty good.
04:15:45 Yeah, when I that's pretty good.
04:15:47 How much is that?
04:15:48 That is about that's got to be 200 and that's maybe like 250 or something.
04:15:55 That's got to be 30 pounds of dairy.
04:15:58 I think the blue and the yellow plates are 45.
04:16:04 And I think I'm not could be more, actually.
04:16:08 So it's pretty good.
04:16:09 That's way more than I could lift.
04:16:12 It's a respectable squat.
04:16:15 I am looking respectfully.
04:16:17 I am looking respectfully.
04:16:18 I'm looking for knowledge.
04:16:22 You see, I want to get to where this lady is.
04:16:26 And and good squat posture is important.
04:16:28 So I need to look at a lot of them.
04:16:30 And yeah, it's important.
04:16:32 Don't forget when when you get to here, you know, post plenty of pics online,
04:16:37 you know, we want to want to root for you.
04:16:39 We want to root for you, Gibb.
04:16:41 You know, we're yeah, yeah.
04:16:42 No, no, definitely, definitely.
04:16:44 Did I mention that I'm back to lifting?
04:16:46 Did I mention I'm lifting again?
04:16:49 I'm not.
04:16:50 That feels good.
04:16:51 I think you did mention I've been doing it for maybe like for maybe three weeks
04:16:54 for a month now.
04:16:55 And I'm it's fun.
04:16:58 I like it.
04:16:59 God fucking damn it.
04:17:00 OK, sorry.
04:17:00 I'm switching back to my hot mobile hotspot.
04:17:04 And maybe that will work this time.
04:17:07 You know, I'll be I'll be I'll be squatting this much.
04:17:11 In maybe in a few months.
04:17:17 And then just letting you know that if you're doing squats, you know,

04:17:24 Big man, because we're oh, yeah, OK, I want to be rooted for.
04:17:28 I want to be exactly, you know, we want to we want to admire the physique
04:17:32 that you're going for, right?
04:17:35 Uh, I want to be I want to be mired.
04:17:37 Yeah, I want to be mired.
04:17:40 OK, so it's just one image, right?
04:17:43 Yes.
04:17:44 OK, OK, so me go exhaling vape.
04:17:48 I love vapors in my lungs.
04:17:52 See, that seems true.
04:17:54 But then look, look at what I'm saying.
04:17:56 Tee hee, ha ha.
04:17:57 I love when Vinny sends me memes.
04:18:00 Heart react.
04:18:01 I've never done that.
04:18:03 I've never once heart reacted.
04:18:06 Shake your DMs.
04:18:07 Vinny, Vinny sends me memes.
04:18:10 And once that occasionally I will have a comment in response.
04:18:15 Most of the time I do not.
04:18:19 The memes have to be gold standard.
04:18:21 They have to be platinum memes for me to to even crack a smile.
04:18:26 I've got a I've got a very advanced palette.
04:18:31 Then I say, I wonder if Ben St would let me invite Vinny to an episode of the PCP.
04:18:37 Lol, maybe.
04:18:39 You know, this is exactly what I would say.
04:18:40 I can't believe you're always you're always wondering that you're all you're always
04:18:44 you're always wondering that as soon as the episode ends and we stop recording.
04:18:48 You're always asking me that and I'm always saying I know and I'm always
04:18:51 saying, you know, I was thinking the exact same thing.
04:18:56 We just never get around to it.
04:18:57 We just never get around to it.
04:18:58 Vinny needs to redraw this and I'm going to give his place and I'm like, ha ha.
04:19:04 He's so funny.
04:19:06 I wonder if Pan will be down with letting him be a guest on the pizza party podcast.
04:19:10 He's really so funny.
04:19:12 Pan should let me be the co-host of the pizza party podcast because all his co-hosts
04:19:18 have abandoned him and I will be loyal.
04:19:21 I will be I will be unflinchingly loyal to pizza pan if I can be his podcast.
04:19:29 Pizza pan.
04:19:29 I think I think pan has like it's pretty much on this that peanut boat.
04:19:36 Like he's not he's not leaving this.
04:19:38 And I think I think that's like two things because like one like that peanut will do
04:19:43 everything for him, right?
04:19:46 Which is like, oh, thank God for him.
04:19:48 Right.
04:19:49 And also like like Daph is never going to like.
04:19:53 Daph is kind of like, oh, a weird like kind of yes man to pan and also like he's popular.
04:20:00 Right.
04:20:00 It's that's good for pan too.
04:20:03 Well, I see the appeal.
04:20:05 So I guess I can't compete with that.
04:20:09 Ben, do you think you could do you think you could bring up a topic to pan pizza?
04:20:14 And then he says, yeah, yeah.
04:20:16 And then you bring up another topic right after.
04:20:18 Do you think you have that skill?
04:20:20 Yeah, I think so.
04:20:21 Yeah, I think I got it.
04:20:22 Yeah, I think I damn.
04:20:24 Damn, are you telling me that I could do I should do what he does and he should clean my balls?
04:20:32 Yes.
04:20:36 That's so funny because he's cleaning pan pizzas balls.
04:20:38 And so you'll be doing that too.
04:20:42 If those balls will be spotless, you'll be able to see your face in them.
04:20:46 I want to I want to be able to eat off those balls because that's what I'm going to do
04:20:50 after this podcast is over.
04:20:52 He needs them balls nice and clean before neon coffee comes to visit.
04:20:56 He's a spotless man.
04:21:00 Well, if you're the man for the job, you gotta.
04:21:02 What would what would what would Vinny have?
04:21:04 What would Vinny even have to say on on on the PCP?
04:21:09 What does he want to be a guest for?
04:21:10 What does he want to talk about?
04:21:13 He says he says I wonder if Ben St would let me invite Vinny to an episode of the PCP.
04:21:16 But why?
04:21:18 But why?
04:21:19 Vinny is just inflating his own ego.
04:21:21 He wants to believe that I would say this.
04:21:27 Vinny, I love your comics, but I don't know.
04:21:30 Vinny, baby.
04:21:30 I mean, I guess you could give a good guess.
04:21:32 What's there to say?
04:21:34 What's there to say?
04:21:37 It's just funny that you would make me say it in a comic.
04:21:41 I'm not actually to against it.
04:21:44 It's just I don't know why it's it's down down here.
04:21:47 It says I drew this real quick Saturday night on my tablet.
04:21:50 You've probably forgot, but I have sent in picture I've drawn on my tablet to the PCP before.
04:21:55 The one there was with CWC Sonichu with the shadow of a dick cast over her face.
04:22:00 Oh, that was you.
04:22:01 OK, I do remember that one.
04:22:03 Then there was the samurai baby, you know, in the ninja outfit with face covered by mask.
04:22:08 No, sexy law.
04:22:09 No, sexy.
04:22:11 OK. Oh, yeah, I do remember that.
04:22:13 I do remember that.
04:22:16 OK.
04:22:18 You know, I think there is another one.
04:22:20 I think we got a last minute voice.
04:22:22 Yes, is it Yo Sly Mernalia?
04:22:25 Yeah.
04:22:27 Should I post it?
04:22:28 I'll post it.
04:22:30 Yeah, I got it.
04:22:31 Sweet.
04:22:32 Let's see if it works.
04:22:33 Three, two, one, go.
04:22:36 Yo Sly Mernalia, everybody.
04:22:39 Hey, just calling in, checking in, letting you know,
04:22:41 join the PCP Minecraft server.
04:22:43 Just like the last few years, we're doing a little wish list, you know,
04:22:47 send type out your wish list, send it to Phoebus or I think it was mage.
04:22:51 I think that was the lore.
04:22:53 But yeah, you know, get some cool items for your Minecraft.
04:22:55 Oh, cheat, cheat, some Pokemon stuff, whatever.
04:22:58 I don't know.
04:22:59 Fuck it.
04:23:01 Have a good one or whatever the hell you celebrate as long as it's Sly Mernalia.
04:23:07 Right.
04:23:07 Remember, was it, was there a, was there a Sly Mernalia event last year?
04:23:15 I actually don't remember.
04:23:17 There must have been, but I don't know whether we knew about it.
04:23:21 I don't remember if it was last year, but I do remember doing some,
04:23:24 some holiday festivities in the, in the PCP Minecraft server.
04:23:29 Yeah.
04:23:30 That may have been Easter of last year or something.
04:23:34 There was like a rabbit catching thing.
04:23:36 How does, how does eggs, how does someone join the, the Minecraft server?
04:23:44 I mean, I guess if you're a patron, right?
04:23:46 If you're a patron, you get access to the Minecraft server.
04:23:48 I'm pretty sure Marin, I'm pretty sure Marin just lets people in again, against our will.
04:23:55 I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure Marin is just, is just, is just going behind our back
04:24:02 and over our heads on that one.
04:24:03 And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not even.
04:24:06 I'm not even, I'm not actually that mad, although I should be, but I'm not.
04:24:10 So whatever.
04:24:12 Marin will get you into the PCP Minecraft, but please become a patron also.
04:24:16 Maybe we should just let people into the PCP Minecraft server.
04:24:19 Maybe we should just not make that exclusive anymore.
04:24:23 Because the, the, the, the, the, the upshot of that is just that there were very few people
04:24:29 in the server and that's, that's kind of not really beneficial to it.
04:24:34 Because most people who are patrons are not patrons specifically for the Minecraft server.
04:24:39 So maybe we should just open that up.
04:24:42 I think it'd be good.
04:24:42 Marin, let's just-
04:24:43 It'd be fun to see people around.
04:24:44 Yeah, Marin.
04:24:45 Maybe it'll get more people interested in the streams as well.
04:24:48 Let's just, I'll just say it.
04:24:49 Marin, just let anyone into the fucking Minecraft server.
04:24:51 It's not, it's not an exclusive patron thing anymore.
04:24:54 Don't worry about it.
04:24:56 Okay, it's, that's it.
04:24:59 Thanks for the voicemail.
04:25:01 Uh, I guess that's the end.
04:25:06 So I'll ask you one more time.
04:25:08 Did anything interesting happen to you this week?
04:25:15 To me?
04:25:17 Everyone.
04:25:18 I, um, I finished rough drafting Ms. Nick Paglacci.
04:25:21 That's coming out next month.
04:25:23 Oh, yeah.
04:25:24 The what thing?
04:25:25 Nick Paglacci is coming out.
04:25:28 Nick Paglacci?
04:25:29 First of all, I'm like 90% sure it's pronounced Paglacci.
04:25:33 Yeah, bitch, I bet it's pronounced that way, motherfucker.
04:25:36 Bitch, bitch, bitch.
04:25:36 I bet you pronounce it that way.
04:25:39 But it's, uh, yeah, that's, um, it's the opera, the clown opera Paglacci,
04:25:46 but drawn with the McDonald's past.
04:25:49 Yeah, it's starting the Ronald McDonald gang.
04:25:53 I, uh, I think I told you that I thought that was a really funny premise a long time ago.
04:25:59 I'm glad you're finally doing it.
04:26:01 Yeah.
04:26:02 Yep.
04:26:02 It's all done in rough draft.
04:26:03 I just actually got to draw it.
04:26:05 And then I'm going to, if Twitter is not dead by the time this video's out,
04:26:10 I'm pretty sure, like, I don't know, the whole thing with like, oh, you can't link other sites
04:26:13 or blah, blah, blah, I'm pretty sure they're going to change that in a couple of hours.
04:26:16 Yeah, I think so too.
04:26:17 That's too fucking stupid.
04:26:19 It's the stupidest fucking move ever.
04:26:22 But if Twitter is not dead, I'm going to be posting that on Twitter.
04:26:26 And then how was that?
04:26:27 How long is it?
04:26:28 It's going to be, uh, it's going to be 60 pages.
04:26:32 Oh, wow.
04:26:33 God damn.
04:26:34 But, um, yeah, I think I could crank this up pretty good because it's not going to be
04:26:38 a black and white.
04:26:39 It's going to be a red and white.
04:26:41 Yeah.
04:26:42 Yeah.
04:26:43 Oh, like downwell.
04:26:45 It's going to be red and slightly yellowish white.
04:26:50 You know.
04:26:50 Really?
04:26:51 Like no black?
04:26:53 Uh, no, because I'm trying to like imitate like Ronald McDonald colors.
04:26:58 But like, I guess kind of like how the wrapper looks like when you order a burger.
04:27:03 Kind of.
04:27:04 Um, oh, I see.
04:27:06 I mean, you, you should use, you should use, you should use red on white, but with like
04:27:10 yellow dots for like screen tones.
04:27:12 Oh, I don't know.
04:27:13 I'm just, I'm just throwing out ideas here.
04:27:15 I, um, I did, um, I drew like a little test image for what the characters would look like.
04:27:21 I don't know if you saw it.
04:27:22 I think I read it.
04:27:23 I don't think, I don't think so.
04:27:25 Yeah.
04:27:26 But, um, it was kind of like, yeah, it was just to see like, okay, this is kind of like
04:27:29 the style I'm going to go for in the comic.
04:27:31 I mean, it's going to be as cartoon, cartoon-y as like everything else I've been doing, you know.
04:27:37 Yeah.
04:27:37 So, um,
04:27:38 Sure.
04:27:39 And, um, I'm pretty sure it kind of get out pretty quickly because there's not going to be no color in it.
04:27:44 And, um,
04:27:46 I think that's really funny.
04:27:47 I think that's going to be cool.
04:27:49 I think you'll like it.
04:27:50 You'll finally, you'll finally be proud of me.
04:27:53 It lasts.
04:27:54 Right.
04:27:55 Okay.
04:27:56 All right.
04:27:57 I think they're right there.
04:27:59 The way they look like.
04:28:00 Yeah.
04:28:02 All right.
04:28:03 Uh, I don't know.
04:28:04 I'll keep an eye on for that.
04:28:05 I think let's, let's wrap up.
04:28:07 All right.
04:28:07 Hey, hey listeners, become a patron.
04:28:10 Sorry.

04:28:33 on the OVA and he has not responded.
04:28:37 Oh yeah.
04:28:37 I saw.
04:28:38 But, uh, I assume he will.

04:28:41 we are definitely going to have some bonus stuff to do.
04:28:44 I have some, we should,
04:28:44 we should make some bonus stuff related to that.
04:28:47 Um, nothing new.
04:28:48 Commentary tricks.
04:28:49 Nothing new for a little bit,
04:28:50 but there's all the old stuff
04:28:52 and there will be new commentaries
04:28:53 and there will be new bonus content
04:28:55 in the not too distant future.
04:28:57 So become a patron if you like.
04:29:00 Uh,
04:29:00 Where's the status update of when is Nate coming back?
04:29:04 That's what I don't know.
04:29:05 I don't know.
04:29:05 He months ago,
04:29:08 he said he was going to start working on it
04:29:09 and then he didn't start working on it.
04:29:11 And then he finally said,
04:29:12 okay, I'm going to start working on it.
04:29:13 And then like a month later,
04:29:14 he said, okay, I've started working on it.
04:29:18 And so I don't know.
04:29:20 He says he's working on it,
04:29:21 but I don't know if he is or not.
04:29:25 That's the status update.
