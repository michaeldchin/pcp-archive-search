00:00:00 I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:03 That son of a bitch.
00:00:05 That son of a bitch.
00:00:07 Son of a bitch.
00:00:09 Son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Alright.
00:00:13 So you want to hear some weird, funny stuff that will make you go,
00:00:18 Wow!
00:00:20 I'm recording, I'm just starting to get some...
00:00:22 Okay, alright, hello everybody.
00:00:24 Sorry, okay.
00:00:27 Alright, we'll start off with some goss.
00:00:30 Do you hear what happened with...
00:00:32 Remember May, aka Digibro?
00:00:35 Oh, no.
00:00:37 You're not ready for this.
00:00:39 I'm probably not ready for it, but sure, go ahead.
00:00:42 It's about as bad.
00:00:45 It's as bad as you can get without incarceration.
00:00:49 Okay.
00:00:50 Without, like, people are in jail over this.
00:00:53 I mean, the word on that is that
00:00:58 Ethan has been tweeting that May,
00:01:02 aka Amanda Lynn Morris,
00:01:05 has only about one week after they got married at Ralphamania.
00:01:12 This is true.
00:01:14 Every word is true.
00:01:16 You know, there was a whole situation where her dad
00:01:20 didn't want them to get married, didn't like Ralph,
00:01:22 and, like, stole the championship belt
00:01:25 that was going to be the prize.
00:01:27 You don't know any of this?
00:01:29 Of course not.
00:01:30 Why would I keep tabs on something so stupid?
00:01:32 I thought I might have mentioned.
00:01:34 I thought I might have mentioned it on the show.
00:01:37 First of all, I hadn't heard that she got married.
00:01:40 You hadn't heard about Ralphamania.
00:01:42 No.
00:01:43 Okay, start with that briefly, because that sounds funny.
00:01:47 Is that, like, a wrestling match and a wedding combined?
00:01:50 Is that what I think it sounds like?
00:01:52 I think so. I think so.
00:01:54 Honestly, I don't know exactly what it entails.
00:01:57 You may now pile driver the bride.
00:02:00 I mean, given Ralph's proclivities, yeah, probably.
00:02:04 I mean, I don't know exactly what Ralphamania entails,
00:02:07 but I know that there was...
00:02:10 Well, they had planned to get married a couple months ago,
00:02:13 I think, at a bowling alley.
00:02:16 Like, bowling alley event.
00:02:18 And they were going to get married,
00:02:20 and then Ralph got, like, punched, or he got beat up.
00:02:23 And he's, like... Like he does.
00:02:25 Like he does, and he was, like, bruised enough
00:02:27 that they canceled the wedding, and they were like,
00:02:29 we'll do this later.
00:02:31 What a life.
00:02:33 I know.
00:02:34 So that happened, and then...
00:02:36 I don't exactly know the details,
00:02:38 but some shit went down, and Ethan or Amanda's family
00:02:43 did not like Ralph, and they were, like,
00:02:46 don't marry him, and she was, like,
00:02:48 fuck you, I'm gonna marry him.
00:02:50 And Ralph was, like, fuck you,
00:02:52 your daughters are gonna marry me.
00:02:54 And Amanda's dad...
00:02:58 I don't think... Okay, I think they left some stuff
00:03:01 in Amanda's dad's house,
00:03:04 and Amanda's dad, like, got rid of it,
00:03:06 or did something with it, and this included
00:03:08 the championship belt that was to be awarded
00:03:11 at Ralph Amania.
00:03:13 And so Amanda's dad stole this belt,
00:03:16 and this was a big point of contention.
00:03:18 He's the champion now.
00:03:19 He's the champion, bitch!
00:03:20 That's what he's gonna do about it.
00:03:22 So that's the backstory.
00:03:25 But they did get married, literally, like, a week ago.
00:03:29 And now, as of yesterday,
00:03:31 Ethan is tweeting,
00:03:33 they were in New York or something,
00:03:35 and Amanda has taken their kid
00:03:38 and fled, and has disappeared,
00:03:41 has kidnapped their child,
00:03:43 and has disappeared into New York City, or something.
00:03:46 Yeah, and is missing.
00:03:48 What?
00:03:50 I don't know.
00:03:52 What information is there on this?
00:03:54 Is it just the tweets?
00:03:56 Just what Ethan said is, like,
00:03:58 she's taken our kid, she's gone,
00:04:00 I have no wife, only a whore.
00:04:03 Stuff like that.
00:04:06 Insults to her family.
00:04:09 Suggestions that he fucked her sister,
00:04:13 which I would say is probably not true.
00:04:16 He's probably just saying stuff,
00:04:18 because he does that.
00:04:22 Yeah.
00:04:24 So they got married.
00:04:27 Amanda and Mae was all about it.
00:04:31 And then ran away.
00:04:34 Did she need the marriage for something?
00:04:37 What?
00:04:39 You think it was a preenup,
00:04:42 a marriage scheme?
00:04:44 Like, haha, now we're going to get divorced and take him?
00:04:47 I don't think she's smart enough for that.
00:04:50 That's why I'm confused.
00:04:52 What on earth could be the reason?
00:04:55 How could you go so far with Ethan Ralph,
00:04:58 and then run away?
00:05:00 You would run away immediately.
00:05:02 I mean,
00:05:04 I was thinking it's like,
00:05:07 the fact that this is immediately after they get married
00:05:10 makes it so much more of a hassle.
00:05:12 Like, now you have to get, if you leave,
00:05:14 now you have to go through the whole legal process
00:05:16 of getting the marriage in old.
00:05:18 Divorced, as they call it these days.
00:05:23 And I feel like that's bad,
00:05:25 but I don't know, maybe,
00:05:27 maybe she did it to get a freaking child support.
00:05:31 Maybe the whole thing was just a big child support scheme.
00:05:35 Or maybe at some point it became,
00:05:37 you know what?
00:05:39 Maybe I'm giving her too much credit,
00:05:41 but maybe she thought
00:05:43 that if she went through with the marriage,
00:05:46 she could get a better,
00:05:48 whatever you call it, alimony settlement,
00:05:51 if they divorce,
00:05:53 because they have their kid.
00:05:55 Which would honestly be pretty smart.
00:05:57 Sort of.
00:05:59 How do we know if she ran away?
00:06:01 What if she was kidnapped?
00:06:03 What if this is like a movie?
00:06:05 Ethan said they had an argument or something.
00:06:07 Okay.
00:06:09 That makes it sound like,
00:06:11 like,
00:06:13 all right, now I'm thinking
00:06:15 Ethan was waiting for the marriage.
00:06:17 And then
00:06:19 that's where he truly spews his bile.
00:06:21 Showed his true colors.
00:06:23 He showed his true colors.
00:06:25 Like, now that you're married to me,
00:06:27 perhaps, perhaps.
00:06:29 But then he's like so
00:06:31 bare-facedly awful.
00:06:33 Yeah, right.
00:06:35 I don't even know what they could argue about.
00:06:37 Maybe Ethan Ralph was going
00:06:39 two left wing.
00:06:41 It's like,
00:06:43 he like sees on like a magazine cover.
00:06:45 He sees like
00:06:47 Alexander Ocasio-Cortez
00:06:49 and he's just like,
00:06:51 hmm, were you looking at her again?
00:06:53 Keep your eyes off her
00:06:55 buster.
00:06:57 Ugh.
00:06:59 Oh.
00:07:01 Well, that's pretty funny.
00:07:03 It is pretty funny.
00:07:05 That's the
00:07:07 honestly first smart thing
00:07:09 Amanda's done
00:07:11 possibly ever.
00:07:13 Yeah, I guess.
00:07:15 Aside from leaving Trixie,
00:07:17 but I mean that kind of goes hand in hand
00:07:19 with getting with Ethan Ralph.
00:07:21 Not sure if I would say it was a net
00:07:23 positive. Probably not, honestly.
00:07:25 But
00:07:27 alimony though.
00:07:29 That's sweet alimony.
00:07:31 Maybe.
00:07:33 It's just so, like, outrageous.
00:07:35 It is outrageous. I know. I saw this.
00:07:37 It was Michelle.
00:07:39 Michelle DM'd me to be like,
00:07:41 look at these screenshots.
00:07:43 It's like, oh my god.
00:07:45 Well,
00:07:47 I guess I'm glad for the update.
00:07:49 Michelle's my man on the inside.
00:07:51 Whenever there's hot goss,
00:07:53 Michelle is like, yo, check it out.
00:07:55 Oh, fuck.
00:07:57 Ah, shit.
00:07:59 I guess that's all I could say about that.
00:08:01 I'm only seven minutes in.
00:08:03 Welcome everyone to the pro-crastinators podcast.
00:08:05 Pro-crastinators podcast.
00:08:07 That was the intro.
00:08:11 Okay.
00:08:13 I have a couple things to say.
00:08:15 One,
00:08:17 the
00:08:19 the project that we
00:08:21 discussed last week,
00:08:23 you know, other than
00:08:25 the cover art mockups that I
00:08:27 showed you, I did a little
00:08:29 speculative
00:08:31 cover design. Other than that, I have
00:08:33 not done anything on it.
00:08:35 That's okay.
00:08:37 I have reasons, but my reasons for that
00:08:39 partially include
00:08:41 that I spent a considerable amount of this
00:08:43 week trying to get the RSSS feed
00:08:45 updated.
00:08:47 It was a bitch.
00:08:49 Man, yeah, did you see what I
00:08:51 said?
00:08:53 I don't really understand
00:08:55 what it requires
00:08:57 or what's broken, but it sounded
00:08:59 like it was hell and
00:09:01 way more complicated than it needed to be.
00:09:03 It was hard for me the
00:09:05 first time, like when Tom explained how
00:09:07 it worked, it was tough for me to get to grips
00:09:09 with it just because there's a lot of steps involved.
00:09:11 I had to log into a bunch of websites
00:09:13 I'd never logged into before,
00:09:15 and I had to, you know,
00:09:17 do all this stuff.
00:09:19 But I figured it out, and that was a couple months ago.
00:09:21 And then
00:09:23 I try to get in there today, and I do
00:09:25 and I'm doing exactly the same thing, and it's not working
00:09:27 and I'm like, what's wrong, what's wrong?
00:09:29 So I spent like two days trying to
00:09:31 figure it out and talking to customer service
00:09:33 and what eventually comes out
00:09:35 the second time I talk to customer service
00:09:37 is it seems like there are new data limits
00:09:39 that were not there before.
00:09:41 So I have imposed a new restriction
00:09:43 of only, the website can only store
00:09:45 the hosting will only host 50
00:09:47 gigabytes of data.
00:09:49 And we're already up to 66 gigabytes
00:09:51 which means, and that's why
00:09:53 it wasn't letting me upload anymore stuff.
00:09:55 How, what's
00:09:57 making up those gigabytes? Is it like
00:09:59 just the MP3s?
00:10:01 Yeah, it's the MP3, it's the 345,
00:10:03 well 315 MP3s
00:10:05 of the podcast. Yeah, okay, that's a lot of MP3s.
00:10:07 Yeah.
00:10:09 So, and this is really bad because
00:10:11 I mean, one, it means I can't
00:10:13 I mean, I can't add anymore, I can't add
00:10:15 any more data
00:10:17 with this host.
00:10:19 There's no more room.
00:10:21 Is it not like an upgrade
00:10:23 to a bigger plan thing?
00:10:25 I didn't,
00:10:27 there probably is.
00:10:29 Honestly, I clicked around their website
00:10:31 and I couldn't really find
00:10:33 like a clear statement
00:10:35 of like, what are the plans?
00:10:37 Like what would it cost to upgrade?
00:10:39 I'm kind of just pissed
00:10:41 because like
00:10:43 there was room before
00:10:45 like we didn't change what we were doing
00:10:47 but they've changed what they're giving us
00:10:49 for the money we were paying them.
00:10:51 That pisses me off.
00:10:53 But yeah,
00:10:55 I couldn't really figure out exactly
00:10:57 how much it would cost
00:10:59 to increase our storage size.
00:11:01 Theoretically, maybe
00:11:03 there's a way that we could just pay them more
00:11:05 and get more storage.
00:11:07 Or we could
00:11:09 switching hosts with Theoretically also
00:11:11 work.
00:11:13 Although we'd have to go and update all the
00:11:15 previous links
00:11:17 if the stuff was hosted on the new server.
00:11:23 And yeah,
00:11:27 just
00:11:29 very discouraging.
00:11:31 Very discouraging.
00:11:33 What good is the website?
00:11:35 Because we had it
00:11:37 specifically to make the
00:11:39 thing link to iTunes or whatever.
00:11:43 Yeah, the website
00:11:45 posting on the website
00:11:47 and again,
00:11:49 I don't really understand how RSS works.
00:11:51 I just know that when I make the post on the website
00:11:53 it auto posts to
00:11:55 Spotify, iTunes,
00:11:57 whatever.
00:11:59 So it does that
00:12:01 which is
00:12:03 good.
00:12:07 But also
00:12:09 I don't know if like anybody
00:12:11 I don't know if anybody even uses those
00:12:13 apps. I mean, not that regularly.
00:12:17 And uh...
00:12:19 There's always a couple people.
00:12:21 There's a couple people. There is a couple.
00:12:23 I know. Yeah.
00:12:25 I think it's literally just because
00:12:27 if you're on your phone
00:12:29 you need to pay for YouTube
00:12:31 red
00:12:33 or like it's a hassle
00:12:35 to listen on YouTube. Yeah, it's easier
00:12:37 to listen on your phone
00:12:39 in mp3 format or whatever.
00:12:41 That's fine.
00:12:43 I guess I get it.
00:12:45 But you know, most people
00:12:47 don't do it that way.
00:12:49 And
00:12:51 other than that the website,
00:12:53 I mean, it's a convenient
00:12:55 archive like you said
00:12:57 and
00:12:59 I guess the plan was we were going to be releasing
00:13:01 the perfect
00:13:03 comic party through the website
00:13:05 which makes
00:13:07 sense.
00:13:09 Um...
00:13:11 I mean this storage limit is a
00:13:13 pretty fucking like we can't do that
00:13:15 until that's resolved.
00:13:17 So...
00:13:21 Yeah, I guess I like having the
00:13:23 website. It's just like
00:13:25 a lot of trouble associated
00:13:27 with it and now there's a bit of
00:13:29 new hurdle
00:13:31 that is
00:13:33 a new challenge
00:13:35 for us to rise to
00:13:37 and overcome.
00:13:41 I think we will have to either upgrade
00:13:43 our choices are we upgrade
00:13:45 or we get a new host and figure out
00:13:47 how to make the website work with the new host
00:13:49 or we just can't, we delete the website.
00:13:51 Yeah.
00:13:53 Those are the three paths forward.
00:13:55 Well, what was the thing
00:13:57 like the thing
00:13:59 that was like
00:14:01 make podcasts
00:14:03 easy. You just put a thing and it does everything.
00:14:05 What was that?
00:14:07 Somebody said that, Chip said that.
00:14:09 Chip said something called, was it called
00:14:11 Autumn?
00:14:13 It was called like Autumn.fm,
00:14:15 Anchor.fm
00:14:17 The best hassle free option for
00:14:19 podcast hosting. You just upload the audio
00:14:21 file in one place and it gets published to all the
00:14:23 apps. Yeah, I mean
00:14:25 I vaguely heard of that before.
00:14:27 I guess if we delete the website
00:14:29 then we could try that
00:14:31 see if it's easier.
00:14:33 That's what the RSS feed
00:14:35 does for us now.
00:14:37 So
00:14:39 I guess RSS feed
00:14:41 is like the
00:14:43 tech person
00:14:45 the tech
00:14:47 what's the word legitimate
00:14:49 tech literate person's
00:14:51 version of Anchor.
00:14:53 If you know what you're doing
00:14:55 you can avoid using
00:14:57 a software that's owned by somebody.
00:14:59 I mean I guess
00:15:01 if we got rid of the website
00:15:03 that would allow us
00:15:05 to continue
00:15:07 updating all the apps simultaneously
00:15:09 which could be useful.
00:15:13 Honestly
00:15:15 now that I've cooled down a little bit
00:15:17 if it's
00:15:19 not
00:15:21 particularly expensive
00:15:23 upgrading our
00:15:25 fucking stupid Bluehost subscription
00:15:27 is probably the easiest and most pain
00:15:29 free way to do it
00:15:31 depending on how much
00:15:33 but again I clicked around and tried to
00:15:35 look for
00:15:37 plans and like the website was very cagey
00:15:39 about it and I couldn't just find a clear
00:15:41 like
00:15:43 10 more dollars a month and we'll upgrade
00:15:45 you from 50 to 500
00:15:47 gigabytes or something like that
00:15:49 websites
00:15:51 websites so anyway
00:15:53 that's I didn't do a lot of stuff this week
00:15:55 I didn't stream I didn't stream again
00:15:57 I dropped the ball I meant
00:15:59 to start streaming battle network
00:16:01 and then I didn't do anymore that
00:16:03 this week because I was
00:16:05 what the fuck I feel like a lot
00:16:07 happened this week and yet I didn't get anything
00:16:09 done that's what it feels like
00:16:11 yeah same
00:16:13 probably for
00:16:15 completely different reasons
00:16:17 maybe I had stuff going on on Friday
00:16:19 yesterday
00:16:21 band practice
00:16:23 you know the band you know that band
00:16:25 the dad's band I was in the dad
00:16:27 I was gonna say is the dad the dad's band
00:16:29 the dad band they're gonna do another charity
00:16:31 thing at some point
00:16:33 everybody liked the last one all their
00:16:35 friends all the people who went it's like oh when
00:16:37 you gonna do more
00:16:39 good I'm like okay I can
00:16:41 I can be the second guitar
00:16:43 again whenever they would be
00:16:45 would be at the same venue
00:16:47 it might be that was a good venue
00:16:49 hmm
00:16:51 uh
00:16:53 yeah probably

00:19:13 what's the
00:19:15 the genocide root
00:19:17 um
00:19:19 I feel so dumb
00:19:21 now I'm like disturbed that I can't
00:19:23 think of it but it's but you whatever
00:19:25 one. I also am blanking on it. I think you had it for half a second, but then you switched
00:19:30 the Asgore thing and now it's blanked my memory. No! You had it. You did have it. Battle against
00:19:36 a true... Wait, wait. I know it starts with a little piano. Kind of like Asgore. It starts
00:19:44 with a little piano progression. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you.
00:20:00 Okay, well, that's... Okay, here's my proposed set list. Battle against a true hero. Asgore.
00:20:10 What do we think? What do we think? They like to, because they got a singer, they like to sing songs
00:20:16 that you have lyrics to. Sorry, buddy. Okay, we can work around that. They're going to do
00:20:25 comfortably now. We practiced that last night. It sounded amazing. Sick. I know that one. I do
00:20:33 know that one. Yes. Yes. I have not played any more Disco Elysium this week. I'm still on
00:20:41 day three, cringe. Did I play anything since last week? I think I played a little bit, but I didn't do
00:20:49 all that much. I think I went around. I talked to the big fat man in the container again. He gave me
00:20:59 a new task. Oh yeah, I went into the little doors, like break into this door and send him a message. I
00:21:07 didn't do that. I broke into the door. I used the key. I got from Mannyana and then I looked inside. I was
00:21:14 like, oh, it's a little place. I guess I want to spoil. Everard gave me the key. Even though I'm a
00:21:24 communist, I didn't do it because I didn't like embossing me around. I have not done it yet, but I'm
00:21:32 leaning towards I probably will do it. Not because Everard told me to, but because everyone else in the
00:21:39 Union seems good and they all like Everard and work for him. For their sake, I'll probably do it.
00:21:48 I think I talked to Mannyana and he's like, yeah, of course Everard's corrupt, but who wouldn't be? We put up
00:21:59 with a little bit of that, oh, he's got a fancy chair just because he does care about the Union and
00:22:06 getting the people what they need. It's hard to imagine because he's so ugly and so annoying voice
00:22:16 and he's busting me around, but maybe it's true.
00:22:18 Honestly, I admire a little bit that he's just unapologetically corrupt. He's just like, yeah, I'm a
00:22:25 fucking smug. Yeah, I'm an oily businessman. You know, what of it? Okay, all right, that's fair.
00:22:33 Doesn't it say in his dialogue somewhere that he's so oily that you can't even tell, even when he's
00:22:40 telling the truth, it sounds like a lie. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, somewhere. Rules. So, I mean, I don't
00:22:48 like embossed me around, but Mannyana says he's good and frickin' the little Irish man says he's good
00:22:55 and all the Union people seem to are with him. So like, okay, whatever. But I mean, but Measurehead
00:23:04 works for him and Measurehead is a real scumbag. So that's bad.
00:23:08 Oh, right. Measurement man.
00:23:11 Measurement, measurement man.
00:23:14 I realize who that is now because I never went to, like, they talked about this guy who's like blocking
00:23:21 the way and I'm like, okay, well, I'm going to bother because like, it's probably going to beat me up.
00:23:25 I didn't go talk to him. I didn't interact with him at all. I found the other way. I already found the other
00:23:30 way round. Yeah, I went back that way and I talked to everyone that way. And I had no reason, I think just to go talk
00:23:37 to that guy. So I just haven't yet. I am by now I realize that's who that is. I should talk to him. I can get some
00:23:44 XP's and get some XP's for my human brain.
00:23:48 I would recommend it. I think I had a very unlikely, I had a very unlikely success against him on some skill
00:23:59 checks that let me get through him. I think I was not really supposed to get by him with my build, but he's got lucky.
00:24:05 Which, you know, whatever, I'll take it.
00:24:10 He's pretty funny. Have you met the crypto zoologist?
00:24:20 Oh, I haven't. I've met his wife in the wheelchair. She says, oh, I need to find him. I don't know where he is.
00:24:30 And I was like, okay, I'll do that side quest. Side quest accepted.
00:24:34 What about the race? Have you met the racist Laurie driver? I'm sure you've met the racist Laurie driver.
00:24:42 Well, the guy standing in the middle of the street.
00:24:46 Yeah, yeah, I talked to him. I think I mentioned that last time.
00:24:49 Yeah, probably.
00:24:51 The new guy I talked to, I guess I talked, I went into the apartment complex. There was the lady sweeping.
00:25:00 Yeah, lady sweeping and the artist girl.
00:25:03 The artist girl and the guy overlooking the crime scene, who I finally realized I could go back around that way.
00:25:14 The boy with the open shirt and the cigarette.
00:25:18 Yeah, I didn't realize the area where the girl was was somewhere I could go.
00:25:24 Yeah, did you just talk to her from down below previously?
00:25:27 Yeah, but even when I talk now that I've ruined my relationship with Kuno, I talk to her from the back and she doesn't even turn around. She ignores me.
00:25:37 Really?
00:25:38 Yeah.
00:25:39 Oh, wait, you mean the forest girl?
00:25:44 Oh, the forest girl, yeah.
00:25:46 Not the artist girl.
00:25:48 No, no, no. I did talk to the artist girl from below. I haven't talked to her again. But the guy with the cigarette, I couldn't get him to say anything, so I had to go and talk to the old lady, get his room number.
00:26:05 Yeah.
00:26:06 And then I have to come back at a specific time the next day and I'm like, shit, I'm going to forget. I'm going to be walking around being like, oh, shit, it's time and I'm not there.
00:26:15 I was, I remember, I think, what did he say, like come back at like 21 hours or something? And I was like, I remember I went to go see Everard and like I was in Everard's office and I was keeping my eye on the clock the whole time.
00:26:29 Because I'm like, I got to meet that guy on the balcony in like 15 minutes.
00:26:36 Are we going to wrap, are we done here? Are we done here, Mr. Clare? Yeah.
00:26:46 Okay, but you haven't gone to meet him yet.
00:26:48 No.
00:26:49 Okay.
00:26:50 Yeah, well, how long nothing in particular going on?
00:26:54 I'm just sort of, there's a lots of things that I'm failing at and I'm like, okay, well, couldn't, I couldn't, oh, I did the worst thing when I talked to the Hardy boys again after Everard said, tell the Hardy boys to cooperate with me, I go back to them.
00:27:14 I do some dialogue but I can't really do anything. But there's this one, try to intimidate them, try to show them who's boss and it failed and then I couldn't help but put my gun in my mouth.
00:27:26 Are you fucking serious?
00:27:28 I was like, I asked Kim for the gun because that was the only option I had. It's like, oh fuck, I fucked up, this is the path I shouldn't have gone down.
00:27:36 You asked Hardy for his gun.
00:27:38 I asked Kim for his gun because I didn't have one. It's like Kim, that's the only way and I couldn't back out of it. I was on the path.
00:27:46 That's really fucked up.
00:27:47 So Kim was like, okay. And then I had his gun and I could only, because I had failed it earlier, the only thing I could do was think about what I was doing and how stupid it was.
00:27:59 And then once those were done, the only thing was I could put the gun in my mouth and say, if you don't respect me, I'll kill myself.
00:28:11 I'll fucking do it.
00:28:15 And there was an option to put the finger on the trigger to increase the tension. I don't know whether that would have made it more likely it would have worked or whether I would have just died so I didn't do that.
00:28:26 I backed out. I was like, no, this is bad. So all I did was lose morale and the respect of everyone there, including Kim, who thinks I'm insane.
00:28:34 Oh no, that sucks.
00:28:37 It's so embarrassing.
00:28:38 Things went pretty well with the Hardy boys for me. Although, okay, you know, I had-
00:28:43 It was a 58% chance to succeed, so I thought it was fine, but no. No. I did the worst possible thing, the most embarrassing. I'm such a fuck up with everyone.
00:28:53 Yeah, you're a real sorry cop. You're a real sorry cop, I gotta say.
00:28:58 I haven't been saved scumming though. I was told not to do that and I was like, this is fun, even though I'm so embarrassing, the game doesn't end, so it's fine.
00:29:11 I think it's okay to let yourself fuck up a little bit.
00:29:16 I had a couple deaths and so this was on, I guess you could call it an alternate timeline, because this got reversed with one of my deaths.
00:29:22 But before I met the Hardy boys, on the first day, when I met, well, you know, I forget her name, but the lawyer girl who was pretending to be the gardener,
00:29:34 When I talked to her the first time, I had, I think I had like a critical failure of like a role, and my whatever personality trait of me was like,
00:29:45 you literally cannot think of anything other than the fact that her skin is a different color than yours.
00:29:51 Oh yeah, I got the same thing.
00:29:52 And I said, it's like, you're black. What?
00:29:55 Yeah, she brought that up later.
00:29:58 Fortunately, that got reversed with one of my losses, so I actually have to deal with that.
00:30:05 Yeah, well, I did that, because it was the only option, because I failed it, and it's just like, okay, and I'm like, yeah.
00:30:13 What kind of music do you listen to?
00:30:15 I'm just observing here, like there was no option that was good.
00:30:18 What kind of music do you listen to? Whatever's on the radio? Okay, bye.
00:30:24 And so when she was revealed to be a lawyer, she saw me and it's like, ah, it's the guy who like, I forget exactly how she put it.
00:30:33 It was like, oh, it's the cop who knows I'm black. Hello.
00:30:36 Like she just brings it up again. God damn it.
00:30:40 True. Very, very observant. Do you know your name yet?
00:30:47 I do. Do you know it?
00:30:52 Yeah.
00:30:53 It's Harry Dubois.
00:30:55 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:30:59 You have not found the cryptozoologist, so you have probably not been down to like the fishing village or the church, right?
00:31:07 Yes, I haven't really, like I feel like I've walked around there, but just haven't found.
00:31:13 I saw the statue, the big exploded statue, and it's like, that's cool.
00:31:18 But I didn't think you could go further south.
00:31:21 There's a, yeah, I was pretty surprised.
00:31:24 There's quite a lot of territory to cover down there that I kind of didn't even realize at first.
00:31:31 Yeah, when I went to the bookstore, there was like the maps on the wall and I bought the postcard and I looked at it and I was like, oh, there's a whole other like southern area.
00:31:39 Yeah, there is a whole other area.
00:31:41 I think it's like across the bay or something like that.
00:31:45 Yeah, it's like the bit where the restaurant is, it's like the end point of the harbor kind of.
00:31:52 Yeah.
00:31:53 Well, I guess where the harbor is, is where the harbor is.
00:31:55 You gotta cross over, I think it's called a waterlock.
00:31:59 It's sort of like a drawbridge, and that's how you get to sort of a whole kind of second section beside from like the city area.
00:32:09 There's going to be so many bottles I can pick up and put in my bag.
00:32:12 Hell yeah.
00:32:14 I kind of like ran through that area like almost without talking to anyone.
00:32:18 So like that, I've like walked all around there down there, but I have not really explored it.
00:32:24 I haven't like done most of the stuff to do down there.
00:32:26 I'm kind of, I gotta do that.
00:32:29 I gotta do that and I gotta, I gotta go back into.
00:32:34 Okay, you, did you do the like bookstore, like did you go into like the back rooms?
00:32:40 Yes, I explored all that.
00:32:42 You find the dice?
00:32:45 The dice lady, yes.
00:32:47 Okay, I think we talked about this.
00:32:48 I missed that and I have to go back and do that.
00:32:50 Yeah.
00:32:51 Did you do the thing, the like the intercom thing and you found like the spooky lady who kept repeating herself?
00:33:00 No, I did not find the spooky lady.
00:33:03 Yeah, I think it's discovered.
00:33:06 I thought of it, but like my character didn't think of it for a while, that it's like a recording of somebody on the phone.
00:33:14 She keeps repeating a bunch of stuff when you press the button and it's like from a company that no longer exists, which has been renamed and it's like the wrong number and stuff.
00:33:25 I don't know where that is physically in the building, so I don't know if I could find that.
00:33:31 Yeah, I haven't done that yet and I, you have not been down south to the church.
00:33:36 I know that the kids, well, you don't know, but there's some kids down there and they mentioned that there was a lady, a mysterious lady in the church.
00:33:45 And just because there's like a mysterious lady in the back of the bookstore and a mysterious lady in the church, I thought, are these the same mysterious lady?
00:33:53 Are these perhaps both of the same mysterious lady who was there at the crime scene with the Hardy Boys, who's left the lights at the footprints?
00:34:00 Hmm, but probably not actually, it probably just started multiple mysterious ladies.
00:34:05 I got the sense that the mysterious lady on the phone, she was responding to somebody, which could be a clue, but it seemed like it was a very old recording.
00:34:16 Because it was for a company that didn't exist anymore, but I guess, I don't know when the company stopped existing.
00:34:22 I think I talked to the dice girl about that. She has info about all of the failed enterprises. You can ask about all of them.
00:34:31 I must have missed a big path back there, because I didn't find any of that.
00:34:39 Did you bring the torch?
00:34:41 Yeah, I did. Maybe I just was in a hurry to do something else and I was like, I'll come back later.
00:34:50 Yeah.
00:34:51 I found the gun back there.
00:34:53 What?
00:34:54 I haven't found the gun yet.
00:34:56 Oh, not like a gun gun. There's like an old gun.
00:34:59 Oh, yeah, no, I found the stashed in the walls.
00:35:03 Yeah.
00:35:04 Like the rifle. Yeah, I picked that up.
00:35:07 Yeah, I found that and I found the polar bear freezer and, oh wait, I think I found a second freaking, did I find like a second computer cube?
00:35:18 Oh, I didn't find a second one of those.
00:35:20 I feel like I found...
00:35:23 Hang on, I need to go pee, sorry.
00:35:25 Or maybe I just found the first one.
00:35:27 Wait, you need, what?
00:35:28 I need to go pee, sorry.
00:35:29 Okay.
00:35:31 Hello?
00:35:32 Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
00:35:39 So where were we? Disco Elysium.
00:35:41 Yeah, although I haven't been playing it, so I don't have much new to report on my end.
00:35:51 Yeah, good game though.
00:35:54 Pretty good game.
00:35:55 Pretty good game.
00:35:56 I was listening to some Grimbeard reviews and I re-listened to his video about planescape torment and he pretty much...
00:36:11 He pretty much says directly that he considers Disco Elysium to be like the truest and most successful successor to planescape torment.
00:36:21 Seems like a pretty nice thing to say about a video game.
00:36:25 I've heard of planescape torment a lot, but I've never gone to play it.
00:36:31 I started it once and I didn't get very far before I found something that frustrated me and I put it down and I didn't pick it up again.
00:36:43 Although, it's kind of...
00:36:47 I mean, you can die in that game as many times as you want and it's fine.
00:36:52 The thing that frustrated me was there was like an item that I found that I used and that I felt like I should not have used.
00:37:00 And I was like, should I reset my save so I get the item back?
00:37:04 Yeah, and I was like, I'll worry about it later.
00:37:10 Oh, I had such a great idea for a meme for Disco Elysium.
00:37:16 I might still make this, but it's just a little involved.
00:37:21 There's a Snoopy comic.
00:37:23 This depends on whether I can find the Snoopy comic.
00:37:25 There's a Snoopy comic where Snoopy is talking about how he hid his foot or something.
00:37:31 And his head blames his eyes for getting hurt and the leg blames his brain.
00:37:40 He's talking about different aspects of his body that are arguing with each other.
00:37:45 And then at the end, he's like, I didn't say anything because I didn't want to get involved.
00:37:49 And I was like, what if you could replace those words with rhetoric and drama and a physical instrument?
00:37:56 Because it's just like how the little Disco Elysium facets of your brain can sometimes disagree.
00:38:04 What a funny meme, guys.
00:38:07 I mean, yeah, good meme.
00:38:10 Just make him Snoopy.
00:38:14 When I'm down, just make him Snoopy.
00:38:17 Give him the old make him Snoopy.
00:38:22 Do you do that now where you're having thoughts and you're like, oh, this is the rhetoric part of my brain.
00:38:28 This is the, what are the names of them?
00:38:33 Inland Empire.
00:38:34 This is the conceptualization.
00:38:37 No.
00:38:38 This is the empathy part coming through.
00:38:40 Like if I was in a discord call, I could talk to different aspects of myself.
00:38:44 That part never comes through.
00:38:46 No, not really.
00:38:48 Dang, maybe I'm fucked up.
00:38:50 Maybe I'm all free.
00:38:54 I mean, just like in real life, you know, in the game, I'm maxed out on encyclopedia,
00:39:01 which is the only part I ever hear from.
00:39:04 It is funny how you see something and encyclopedia will give you a lengthy explanation of what it is,
00:39:14 even though it's very simple what that is.
00:39:17 Sometimes.
00:39:18 Sometimes, yeah.
00:39:19 And it's just sort of like, I wonder if people's brains work like that where they see something and they can't help but think,
00:39:24 oh, yes, that is what this is.
00:39:27 I guess it's not like that.
00:39:28 Yeah, definitely.
00:39:29 But like not in a spoken word, like sentence structure sort of way.
00:39:33 They just sort of know what something is.
00:39:35 Yeah, like in real time, that encyclopedia popping up to give you a text dump would take like a nanosecond.
00:39:42 Yeah.
00:39:43 Yeah.
00:39:45 The brain's funny.
00:39:49 I think it's serious.
00:39:52 Serious business.
00:39:55 Don't you forget it.
00:39:58 Okay.
00:40:00 My favorite one is electrochemistry because it wants me to take drugs.
00:40:09 That is a pretty funny one.
00:40:11 I'm like, it's odd because like in real life, taking drugs is bad.
00:40:19 You never take drugs.
00:40:21 Exactly.
00:40:22 But in a video game.
00:40:23 Nobody would actually take drugs in real life.
00:40:27 In a video game, you're not actually getting the high of a drug.
00:40:32 You're thinking about the benefits to your character in game.
00:40:36 And a lot of the time, I mean, maybe there are literal benefits like stats and stuff.
00:40:43 I feel like a lot of the game is telling you that being extremely high and extremely drunk just makes you like an idiot and you do stupid things and you forget what you did.
00:40:55 Because that's what your character has done.
00:40:57 They're super alcoholics.
00:40:58 Like why would you indulge in that knowing how shitty everything is?
00:41:03 Okay.
00:41:04 I kind of want to do like a drug play through at some point.
00:41:08 I saw someone on Twitter talking about it and they said that their experience was that like they started the game thinking they shouldn't do drugs.
00:41:18 Because they were like, there's got to be some hidden negative to do in drugs.
00:41:25 And then they took drugs and they were like, oh wow, actually taking drugs is like a huge mechanical benefit and your stats like benefit immensely from taking drugs.
00:41:36 And then it turned out at the end, no, there actually was a hidden cost to it.
00:41:39 Like, oh no.
00:41:41 Yeah.
00:41:42 That's how it feels.
00:41:43 I don't know what that is exactly, but that's just what they said there.
00:41:48 Well, it's at the end.
00:41:50 It's like at the end of Undertale, but with the genocide route.
00:41:52 Like you're doing that.
00:41:53 You did the genocide route once and then you look at the photos of all the Disco Elysium characters and then, oh, there's Kyra there.
00:42:00 You fucked up.
00:42:04 It's the drug version of Kyra.
00:42:08 Maybe.
00:42:09 With the red eyes.
00:42:10 I mean, it reminds me of Lisa a little bit.
00:42:13 Like.
00:42:14 Simpson?
00:42:15 No, the game.
00:42:17 Yeah.
00:42:18 There's no, like, you don't get like the bad ending from using joy in Lisa, right?
00:42:27 I can't, I never use joy because of how obviously bad it was and it turned people into beasts.
00:42:34 And I didn't really want to risk having a moment where it's like you've taken too much joy over the course of your adventure.
00:42:40 You just turn into a blob and that's it.
00:42:42 Yeah.
00:42:43 Well, that doesn't happen.
00:42:45 Yeah, I don't know that it happens.
00:42:47 I don't think so.
00:42:48 It would be cool if it did.
00:42:49 If you take like a little bit too much, like maybe there'll be a tell in the game.
00:42:53 It's like you feel like this is a little too much, you know, a little moment of reflection to let you know that if you take one more, you'll turn into a blob.
00:43:04 I think, I don't think it really, I don't think there really is like a big like story change to the game, whether you use joy or not.
00:43:14 There's like one, there's like one party member you can't get if you use joy, but like, who cares?
00:43:19 Yeah, that's kind of annoying, I feel like.
00:43:24 That there's not more of a consequence?
00:43:27 Yeah, because it's like, I mean.
00:43:30 Honestly, I kind of think it's fine because like narratively.
00:43:34 Yeah, I mean, what that what that tells me about the world and about the character is that like it was already too late.
00:43:41 I suppose.
00:43:43 But you only know that once you've played the game and you know how it ends.
00:43:47 And it's like, oh, so now I can play it because I know that there's not like a potential happy ending.
00:43:53 Where you can live long and prosper and all that.
00:43:56 If you're gonna go out like you do.
00:43:58 You may as well drug yourself up the whole way through because you know how it ends because it's.
00:44:04 Yeah, it's like it's like in a in a video game, like an RPG or it's like you don't actually know how many health potions you'll need.
00:44:10 So you keep hold of so many of them.
00:44:12 And by the time you finish the game, you're like, oh, I have 700 of these.
00:44:16 I should have used them.
00:44:17 I should have used them.
00:44:18 Yeah, the whole time.
00:44:20 Yeah, but you're right.
00:44:22 I mean, I think that's probably why in the painful.
00:44:27 It's like, it's they make it as clear as they can that like, no, you're supposed to use the joy.
00:44:32 You pretty much have to use the joy.
00:44:34 No, I resisted.
00:44:36 I thought it would be so good.
00:44:38 Did you did you actually get through it without using it?
00:44:41 Yeah, it's so fucking hard.
00:44:43 Like you can't fucking beat Lobo.
00:44:46 You can.
00:44:47 It's just that you need to do a lot of healing and make sure that every attack is as powerful as you possibly can.
00:44:53 It's it's you're definitely supposed to use it.
00:44:56 The game is balanced on the assumption that you will use it.
00:44:59 And yet and yet and the game tells you the game literally just writes like graffiti on the wall.
00:45:04 It's like use joy like use it.
00:45:06 But I know sinister.
00:45:07 It feels like you're not supposed to listen.
00:45:09 That's what I thought.
00:45:11 Yeah, I thought that they're like that.
00:45:13 Oh, no, you're not going to fuck me up.
00:45:15 I know.
00:45:16 I know what joy does.
00:45:18 You're not.
00:45:19 It's like it's I thought it I felt like it was saying like, um, you know, these are the voices.
00:45:26 This game's this game's super hard.
00:45:28 This game's like super fucking hard, bro.
00:45:31 And you're a little pansy pussy.
00:45:34 So you better use joy and I'm like, fuck you.
00:45:36 No, I'm not.
00:45:37 I'm the coolest.
00:45:38 I'm going to be the hardest motherfucker ever.
00:45:40 I'm going to slice everyone and I did.
00:45:43 God damn.
00:45:45 Yeah, I would recommend trying it because it's not.
00:45:48 As impossible as it seems.
00:45:50 It's not luck based.
00:45:51 You can.
00:45:52 You can do it.
00:45:53 Well, if I mean.
00:45:57 Yeah.
00:45:58 Impressive.
00:45:59 But there's no like reward for it.
00:46:01 No.
00:46:02 Yeah.
00:46:03 Just the reward of being able to say, haha, I did that in regular conversation and people go, what?
00:46:09 Yeah, I can't say that.
00:46:13 I beat I beat Super Mario Brothers and I've did Lisa the joyful without using joy.
00:46:19 Super Mario Brothers.
00:46:21 Super Mario Brothers.
00:46:23 It's hard.
00:46:24 I mean, to be fair, I've never beaten Super Mario Brothers.
00:46:27 Like all the way.
00:46:29 I don't think so.
00:46:30 Yeah.
00:46:31 Hmm.
00:46:33 Hmm.
00:46:34 Can I really even call myself a gamer?
00:46:38 If I didn't beat the first game ever made.
00:46:42 No, you can't be the first game ever made.
00:46:45 I am the first game ever made.
00:46:48 And why is he speak like that?
00:46:51 Because that's how you said it about Rayman.
00:46:53 Oh, video.
00:46:55 The hardest game ever made.
00:46:58 I do so many likes like pointless silly voices in those videos.
00:47:04 Yeah.
00:47:05 I think it's literally just because I was reading the script and I realized I sounded like a
00:47:08 YouTuber.
00:47:10 Like, I gotta sound weird.
00:47:12 You gotta sound weird because I don't like.
00:47:14 I should just say this next line weird so it doesn't get boring.
00:47:17 Yeah.
00:47:19 It's it's it's literally just I think I sound like a real loser real tool when I'm just
00:47:24 doing my script reading voice.
00:47:26 Sure.
00:47:27 I'm casually talking about stuff.
00:47:28 I sound okay.
00:47:29 But like Rayman was it like I don't know how to like read a script in a non lame way.
00:47:36 No, I think if I was like, I mean, if you if you're someone like, if it's like a long
00:47:45 video, then I think you pretty much just have to accept I'm just going to sound boring to
00:47:51 myself because I'm going to be reading the script for like an hour.
00:47:54 If it's not, though, I totally am like, I get I get it.
00:47:57 Like, I've been talking for five minutes now and like, is the audience really want me to
00:48:02 like, sit here and talk for five minutes?
00:48:05 Like, it's boring.
00:48:07 It gets boring after five minutes.
00:48:09 I gotta do something.
00:48:10 I gotta put a joke or an edit or I gotta zoom in my face so it's a little bit bigger and
00:48:15 then zoom it back out.
00:48:17 Otherwise, they'll go back to playing Fortnite.
00:48:21 Otherwise, they'll go back.
00:48:22 Goodness knows that's worse than my video.
00:48:24 Otherwise, they'll go back to doing what the zoomers do, which I gather is watching like
00:48:30 place together three videos in one like one is like a leftist political speech.
00:48:34 The other is like someone like running in Fortnite and the other is someone like, you
00:48:39 know, doing like slime like squishing slime in their hands.
00:48:42 Yeah, most satisfying compilations.
00:48:45 I've seen I've seen those triple videos and I got to say they really work for me.
00:48:50 I like it.
00:48:51 That's I watched one that was like a family guy clips.
00:48:56 And then there was the train, the guy running on the train tracks and getting the coins
00:49:01 and then there was like somebody using like a knife to like cut some weird soap thing.
00:49:06 Yes, the blue like soap.
00:49:08 Yeah.
00:49:09 Yeah.
00:49:10 I was like, this is good.
00:49:11 Actually, like people are like saying, oh my God, the children are so fucked.
00:49:15 I'm like, no, they're not.
00:49:16 They're just they just like this is good.
00:49:19 This is a good like evolution.
00:49:22 I gotta be honest.
00:49:23 I didn't really get it.
00:49:24 I was just like, why am I why are there three videos in one?
00:49:27 If I wanted to watch one of these videos, why wouldn't I just watch one of them?
00:49:30 Because attention span.
00:49:32 I mean, I know, I know so many people.
00:49:36 It's such a normal thing now to like, when you listen to a podcast or a long video or
00:49:41 even just a video that you've seen before, you play a game at the same time, you have
00:49:46 two different stimulus.
00:49:48 I mean, definitely.
00:49:50 But I don't want them to put them together for me.
00:49:53 I want to I want to customize my experience.
00:49:55 I want to match the like the the podcast I want to listen to with the game I want to
00:50:00 play.
00:50:01 True.
00:50:02 I don't I don't want them to do it for me.
00:50:04 I don't mind it, though, because like this particular game they're showing is like that
00:50:10 guy running down.
00:50:11 It's an endless runner.
00:50:12 Yeah.
00:50:13 The the game that is the inputs that they put are like so simple like duck, jump, turn
00:50:19 to the left, turn to the right, get those coins.
00:50:21 It's not a very interesting game to watch, in my opinion.
00:50:24 But like it wouldn't be an interesting game for me to play either.
00:50:27 It's just sort of like, oh, look at him go while I listen to something.
00:50:31 And then I switch my eyes over to the soap and I go back to the little guy.
00:50:35 I do like the soap.
00:50:36 I do like the cutting soap.
00:50:38 Yeah.
00:50:39 But I would just I would just I would just watch that.
00:50:43 I watched someone cut soap on my own damn time.
00:50:47 How many times have you googled soap cutting?
00:50:50 Rarely.
00:50:51 Since you saw it.
00:50:52 Very rarely.
00:50:53 Oh, since none.
00:50:55 Exactly.
00:50:56 So that you need that curation.
00:50:57 You need them to do it for you.
00:50:59 You ain't going to look at it.
00:51:01 I guess.
00:51:02 I guess.
00:51:03 I mean, I guess you're right.
00:51:06 All right.
00:51:07 So lesson learned.
00:51:08 I should be googling soap more.
00:51:11 That'll that'll do that'll do a lot for me.
00:51:17 Well, all all that is to say that I didn't do any work aside from a little bit on the
00:51:23 cover of the project.
00:51:25 Yes, the perfect comic party comic party.
00:51:29 I will at some point I will have to actually make that damn content.
00:51:35 Yeah, I've worked a little bit to make some Clarissa had a bit of a little mental moment
00:51:42 or breakdown because, you know, that's that's just how I roll.
00:51:46 Breakdown a moment minute.
00:51:48 Yeah.
00:51:49 But like I feel like I can.
00:51:51 Yeah, I can.
00:51:52 I can do it.
00:51:53 I can.
00:51:54 I can get that chapter ready.
00:51:58 The perfect comic party.
00:52:00 I think we've got a pretty good logo mockup.
00:52:04 I really liked your logo mockup.
00:52:07 Thank you.
00:52:08 I was thinking about like because it's I was looking at shown and jump and they've got
00:52:12 the letters, the blocks text.
00:52:14 You can write it vertical.
00:52:16 You can write it like horizontal, but each letter kanji, whatever fits in a square.
00:52:23 So it's quite easy to make it fit nicely on a rectangular sheet of paper.
00:52:27 Yeah.
00:52:28 But with PCP, you got so much wasted space underneath the P and it's hard to like put
00:52:35 it in a way that it reads nicely.
00:52:40 I think I figured it out.
00:52:41 Do you want to wait?
00:52:42 Did you I'm not looking at the discord.
00:52:44 Do you want to post a shot of it or something?
00:52:47 No, I want to draw a secret.
00:52:48 Okay.
00:52:49 Okay.
00:52:50 I want to draw it cleaner first.
00:52:51 Okay.
00:52:52 I have a I want to be nice and shiny and cool and bold and stuff.
00:52:55 And then yeah, once we once we have a little title, we have to have a logo we can use over
00:53:03 and over again.
00:53:04 Yeah, it looked really good.
00:53:06 And I mentioned, I mean, because the frickin PCP, the Radcon dojin is supposed to be done
00:53:13 really soon.
00:53:14 Like literally the only thing left for it is I think Kaiju has to draw the cover and
00:53:18 like that's it.
00:53:20 And I don't know, we could put that in there or something.
00:53:23 We could include that in the first issue if it's done by then.
00:53:28 We could include like parts of it per weekly publication.
00:53:33 And be like, oh, yeah, so one of the dojin because they're right.
00:53:37 It's in chapters because it's like chapter one.
00:53:40 That's one chapter per episode or per per issue.
00:53:45 But yeah, I need to get my head down nose to the grindstone get the Clarissa because
00:53:52 it's like it's 20 something pages.
00:53:54 And I've got like three inked, not even like finished.
00:53:59 I got to do a bunch of inking and then I got to put the speech bubbles in there and then
00:54:07 the shading is like, I want it to be nice.
00:54:10 So I'm not going to rush it out the door just so they can be part of this thing.
00:54:14 That's why I didn't put like a deadline because I don't think I need to warm up to all this
00:54:20 because I've been so like anti doing anything for like a month.
00:54:28 To get get get the momentum going again.
00:54:31 Yeah, sure.
00:54:35 Ganbatte!
00:54:37 Kibucha!
00:54:39 Thank you.
00:54:41 Arigato.
00:54:42 Thank you.
00:54:47 What else?
00:54:48 I guess I got I guess I don't have that much more to say about that.
00:54:54 It's going to be fun.
00:54:56 It is going to be fun.
00:54:58 You know, despite it being like, oh, we talked about it and it's not instantly a real thing.
00:55:03 It was really a, I don't mind that too much.
00:55:07 I think it's still like, it's a fun thing to think about getting done.
00:55:12 It was never going to be done in one week.
00:55:14 No.
00:55:15 Yeah.
00:55:16 I did think I could get more done.
00:55:18 Like I could get the title, the logo finished.
00:55:21 But sometimes a week is fucked.
00:55:26 And then you and then you relapse and your therapist says, you know, you got to just fucking do it.
00:55:33 You idiot.
00:55:34 They don't, they didn't say that.
00:55:35 But like that was that was the essential thing.
00:55:38 Like you're, you're, you're, you're looking inwards and you're making yourself feel worse.
00:55:43 And so you have to, I can't remember exactly what they said.
00:55:47 I can read it later.
00:55:48 But like, it's essentially that they're not offering consulance, condolences or like pats on the back ruffles of the hair.
00:55:59 They're saying, you know that you have to do this stuff.
00:56:04 So you'll feel better if you do it.
00:56:06 So do it.
00:56:07 And it's like, God, I wish you would just say, no, you can wallow in misery forever and it would be great.
00:56:12 But they won't say that.
00:56:14 I'll tell you that.
00:56:15 I say you can wallow in misery forever.
00:56:17 It's fine.
00:56:19 Do I really want to listen to Ben Saint?
00:56:22 I don't know.
00:56:23 That devil's bargain.
00:56:28 Yeah.
00:56:29 So I'll draw.
00:56:30 I'll draw.
00:56:31 And I'm going to do it.
00:56:32 There's also, there's also the question because I had this last year, February drawing like booby images all over February last year.
00:56:44 That was a daily draw thing.
00:56:46 I still want to do that.
00:56:48 I don't want it to be too serious though.
00:56:52 So I'd be a little, just a little doodle every day, something, something to get the blood pumping in my art hand.
00:57:00 Honestly, warming up is good.
00:57:03 Warming up every day is like a good thing to do that like real artists do that I have never done.
00:57:08 And that's probably why I'm a hack fraud and have to come up with stupid schemes like the perfect comic party to motivate me to do that.
00:57:16 It's all baked in.
00:57:19 Warming up is hard because you're drawing and you're like, this isn't a good drawing.
00:57:24 Right.
00:57:25 Because you're fucked in the head and you think every drawing has to be good.
00:57:30 That's not how professionals do it.
00:57:34 They draw billions of drawings.
00:57:38 And then they just, they get the work done.
00:57:41 I mean, I know, I already know that it's more important to put the hours in than it is to make progress during those hours.
00:57:48 Because putting the hours in makes you feel like productive, which helps you like mentally to stay on track.
00:57:57 If you say like, I'm going to take a break today and you don't put those hours in.
00:58:02 Even if those hours are spent just looking at a sheet of blank paper, the fact that you did it means that it's easier to do it later.
00:58:11 And I know that, yet I know that.
00:58:14 And yet I'm just not sticking to my schedule.
00:58:20 I'm going to change that.
00:58:22 This coming Monday, I'm going to change that.
00:58:25 That's a different struggle you're describing than mine.
00:58:34 What's your struggle?
00:58:37 My struggle is not like, oh, I don't want to put the hours in.
00:58:42 I'm afraid my drawings will be bad, et cetera.
00:58:47 I don't know.
00:58:49 My struggle is like, say it, you know, yeah, I could put the hours in.
00:58:54 And maybe the drawing will come out good.
00:58:57 So what?
00:58:59 Yeah, that's the more fundamental like, why do anything thing I was struggling with.
00:59:05 Yeah, I don't know.
00:59:08 Well, you got to do it for the perfect comic party, Ben.
00:59:11 That's exactly right. That's exactly why. That's exactly right.
00:59:15 So there you go.
00:59:17 Nothing is real.
00:59:19 Everything is made of fake little lies we tell ourselves.
00:59:23 And our lie right now is the perfect comic party.
00:59:27 That's good.
00:59:29 We should make that the tagline, perfect comic party.
00:59:31 It's the lie we tell ourselves.
00:59:35 Oh, Ben, if you could translate that to Japanese, we could put that on the side.
00:59:41 Put that on the cover somewhere.
00:59:43 I could machine translate it.
00:59:45 I would probably want to ask an actual speaker how they would really translate.
00:59:51 That's really funny, honestly.
00:59:56 You can make a shirt.
00:59:59 That would be a great shirt.
01:00:02 The PCP logo, perfect comic party, and then the Japanese text underneath.
01:00:07 It's the lie we tell ourselves.
01:00:16 I think we should rebrand everything.
01:00:19 Did I mention this last week?
01:00:21 I think you did, yeah.
01:00:23 We've been needing a rebrand for a while,
01:00:26 and I think this is the perfect opportunity to rebrand the Patreon,
01:00:31 rebrand the YouTube channel, rebrand everything.
01:00:36 In line with the new aesthetic of we do a comic compilation.
01:00:43 Submit your stuff if you want to be included in our ever so often regular comic publication
01:00:51 where we publish our own comics instead of publications.
01:00:53 Hell yeah.
01:00:55 It's the lie we tell ourselves, and it's the procrastinators podcast.
01:00:59 Yes.
01:01:01 You need to think of a way to squish perfect comic party into a square format for avatars and stuff.
01:01:09 The fact that the website has this problem now is really frustrating though,
01:01:15 because the plan was we were going to publish it on the website,
01:01:18 so now I don't know what to do with that.
01:01:21 I'm sure we'll think of something.
01:01:23 Either way, we'd want the website to look nicer than it does currently.
01:01:27 You know, the website does look like shit now that you mentioned it.
01:01:33 Does it still have that default plant pot image?
01:01:37 Yes.
01:01:39 You know, it is crap.
01:01:44 It's not a hip-happening joint that all the cool kids want to go to.
01:01:50 You know what?
01:01:51 You make a good point, fuck WordPress.
01:01:55 Fuck everything.
01:01:58 Do you know how to make a website?
01:02:00 Because I really don't.
01:02:02 Yeah.
01:02:03 I mean, I made mine.
01:02:04 Yeah, and it's nice and slick.
01:02:06 It's a bit hard.
01:02:07 Mine is slick.
01:02:09 Honestly, I mean, if I were to be tasked with making a website,
01:02:14 what I would probably do is just take my code for my website
01:02:18 and take that as my baseline and just, you know,
01:02:22 modify it, swap out assets, and re-theme it, basically.
01:02:26 Yeah.
01:02:27 Because, I mean, my website is very pretty, you know,
01:02:31 format-wise, it's pretty clean and straightforward and uncomplicated,
01:02:35 and it's just about, you know, presenting content front and center.
01:02:38 Yeah.
01:02:39 So, yeah.
01:02:41 I feel like I've heard you say that it's a kind of,
01:02:45 you built it in a kind of way where it's annoying to add new pages
01:02:49 of things to comics.
01:02:51 I did.
01:02:52 Did you, like, improve that at some point?
01:02:54 Some, well, somewhat, yeah, somewhat.
01:02:58 I did make it, I did make it a bit more modular in that,
01:03:03 like, I made it so that, like, more of it refers to, you know,
01:03:08 a cascading style sheet, and therefore,
01:03:11 I don't have to change every individual page.
01:03:14 If I want to make one little change, you know,
01:03:17 I made, like, one, I added an iframe that included a window
01:03:21 into a sort of default template menu,
01:03:24 so I can just change the menu file,
01:03:27 and that changes the menu on every page.
01:03:29 I did improve it somewhat with that, yeah.
01:03:32 I still have to, like, I still have to manually add, like,
01:03:35 new pages, like, when there's a new, you know, page,
01:03:39 when there's a new page of the comic, I have to add a new page of the website
01:03:42 to accommodate it, but I mean, that's okay.
01:03:45 How would we put Perfect Comic Party on a website like that?
01:03:49 Would it be page, one page per page,
01:03:52 or would it be, like, a long scroll?
01:03:58 Honestly, I kind of think that if we did it like that,
01:04:03 we wouldn't, like, even necessarily display it on the website.
01:04:06 It would just kind of be a home page with, like,
01:04:09 a sort of dated index of, like, links to issues,
01:04:13 and you would just download them.
01:04:15 Yeah, that was what I was initially thinking
01:04:18 when it comes to PDF.
01:04:20 Okay.
01:04:22 The website would basically, it would be a little bit of branding,
01:04:24 you know, we got the title, we got some art, whatever,
01:04:28 but it's mostly just a portal to,
01:04:30 here's where you download the individual issues,
01:04:33 and then, you know, here's where you can donate,
01:04:35 here's where you can get rewards, whatever.
01:04:38 Yes.
01:04:40 Yeah.
01:04:42 That would be sick, if we had a nice little website.
01:04:45 It would be sick.
01:04:47 We would need to figure out, and I mean, we could host,
01:04:49 well, I mean, we'd need a new host,
01:04:51 but I mean, we could just re-upload the, um...
01:04:54 The MP3s.
01:04:56 The podcasts, yeah.
01:04:58 We could, you know, it would take a little doing,
01:05:00 but it'd be fine.
01:05:02 Yeah, there's, um,
01:05:05 the last, I think the dick show used to be, like,
01:05:09 only on the website.
01:05:11 Well, I mean, you could listen to other apps.
01:05:13 I always went to the website to listen to it when I did,
01:05:15 and they just had a player.
01:05:17 You just have a page, and then the player, and you press play.
01:05:20 And it's like, that was pretty good.
01:05:22 It meant that going to the website was, like,
01:05:25 a thing you would do to see the new episode,
01:05:27 and then it was like the spiel about what the hell
01:05:30 it was about underneath, like a blog post.
01:05:34 I don't know if we, I don't think we have that
01:05:36 on the current WordPress thing.
01:05:38 We just have like a...
01:05:40 The current WordPress just has the pretty much a very similar,
01:05:43 like, to the YouTube description.
01:05:45 Yeah.
01:05:47 Underneath each post.
01:05:49 How would you listen to it?
01:05:51 Would you have to download the MP3?
01:05:53 You can listen to it in line on the website.
01:05:55 There is, like, just a play button,
01:05:57 or you can download the MP3.
01:05:59 Okay, well, then that's fine.
01:06:01 We could just have that again.
01:06:03 It's doable.
01:06:05 I mean, the way it embeds
01:06:08 is done through WordPress.
01:06:10 Whatever. I'm sure there's a simple way
01:06:12 to just fucking add an MP3 player
01:06:15 into your website.
01:06:17 I don't think that would be complicated.
01:06:20 I guess the only thing is the size of the files.
01:06:24 That's, like, more than 50 gigabytes.
01:06:26 Yeah, no, it's the hosting that is the...
01:06:29 That at this point is the sticking point.
01:06:32 You could host all of the images of your comics
01:06:34 on your website.
01:06:36 Yeah, I mean, I have...
01:06:39 I mean, it's not 50 gigs worth, I don't think.
01:06:42 But yeah, I just have, through a separate...
01:06:45 I think I use...
01:06:47 What's the fucking hosting site that I use for that?
01:06:50 SomethingMoon?
01:06:52 I don't remember.
01:06:54 But yeah, I just have...
01:06:56 I bought the domain,
01:06:58 and I have the domain registered,
01:07:00 like, $10 a month or something
01:07:02 to just host...
01:07:05 Just to host all the data on the site.
01:07:09 And I'm not sure if there's a data limit on it or not.
01:07:13 Maybe we should use that service,
01:07:16 because I've never had a problem with them.
01:07:18 Yeah. I use HostGator for the give-and-take.site.
01:07:23 It's not... I don't think it's, like...
01:07:26 I don't know how much it is a month.
01:07:28 It gets as much as $10.
01:07:32 We just need...
01:07:35 I should go and check and, like, see what are the data limits.
01:07:41 We just need something that can host, you know,
01:07:46 100 gigs, 200 gigs,
01:07:48 and I think we'd be good for the foreseeable future.
01:07:51 Yeah.
01:07:53 I guess I should ask fucking blue...
01:07:55 We could ask Bluehost how much it would cost
01:07:57 to up the data limit.
01:07:59 That's probably the move at this point.
01:08:02 Yeah, to upgrade, yeah.
01:08:04 Is it easy to change how it works?
01:08:08 Because if it's through WordPress,
01:08:10 how would you change the code?
01:08:12 I'll be frank with you.
01:08:18 If we wanted to, like, build a custom website,
01:08:22 I think we would just probably abandon WordPress
01:08:27 because, I don't know,
01:08:29 we would be stuck with all of its default shit.
01:08:34 We would have to build a website from scratch.
01:08:41 Well, I guess we shouldn't worry about that too much right now.
01:08:47 The MP3 thing is more important,
01:08:51 and we can just...
01:08:52 Hosting is the most pressing issue.
01:08:54 Yeah, and then I guess making Perfect Comic Party exist
01:08:59 comes before where we host it.
01:09:03 True.
01:09:05 True.
01:09:08 Like, we could have a Google Docs
01:09:10 and put them on there in the meantime.
01:09:15 I mean, yeah, we can do that.
01:09:19 It's so low-rent.
01:09:22 Low-rent which?
01:09:25 Oh my god, I just...
01:09:28 Did I mention low-rent which is canceled?
01:09:30 I'll never get to see it.
01:09:31 You mentioned it on the stream we did.
01:09:35 Right.
01:09:36 Yeah, somebody asked...
01:09:40 Somebody asked Mint where's low-rent which
01:09:43 and Mint confirmed that it is canceled,
01:09:46 so that's sad.
01:09:51 Tragic.
01:09:53 Terrible.
01:09:54 Terrible, terrible.
01:09:55 I was looking forward to it so much.
01:09:58 She'd drawn thousands and thousands of frames, Gib.
01:10:03 I know, it's a big...
01:10:05 Mathematically, that's true.
01:10:07 A waste of man hours on that.
01:10:11 How dare you misgender those hours?
01:10:13 Oh, yeah, I guess that's a word now.
01:10:16 What would you do?
01:10:17 Would you, like, ma'am hours?
01:10:19 Like, ma'am?
01:10:20 Yeah, ma'am hours is the opposite.
01:10:24 That's my go-to.
01:10:26 It's like a ma'am word.
01:10:27 You just say ma'am instead.
01:10:29 Sounds the same.
01:10:31 That's pretty good.
01:10:32 That's pretty good.
01:10:33 Oh, man, I saw...
01:10:34 Oh, man.
01:10:35 I saw a list.
01:10:36 Oh, ma'am.
01:10:37 I saw a list of gender neutral...
01:10:39 Suggestions for gender neutral words
01:10:42 are like people in your family.
01:10:45 And they suck so much.
01:10:48 That's like...
01:10:49 I wish...
01:10:50 I mean, maybe I could find them...
01:10:52 I mean, they're sibling and parent.
01:10:53 What else is there?
01:10:54 Sure, sure.
01:10:55 Like, what words would you invent?
01:10:58 Well...
01:10:59 Like a gender neutral aunt, uncle?
01:11:01 Fucking notifications.
01:11:03 Fucking notifications for...
01:11:05 Fuck!
01:11:06 All right, check in my likes.
01:11:08 Check in my likes.
01:11:09 Here we go, here we go.
01:11:12 Oh, God.
01:11:14 Look at this.
01:11:15 Here we go.
01:11:16 Here's the list I was talking about.
01:11:19 ZZ.
01:11:20 ZZ for aunts and uncles.
01:11:21 You're not my aunt.
01:11:22 You're not my uncle.
01:11:23 You're my ZZ.
01:11:25 Hey, hey, my ZZs.
01:11:27 I kind of like...
01:11:29 I like nibbling.
01:11:30 That's cute.
01:11:32 But I guess nibbling's a little cute.
01:11:35 Sprong.
01:11:37 Horrible.
01:11:38 Yeah, sibling.
01:11:39 Sprong.
01:11:40 Ren.
01:11:41 Ren.
01:11:42 What the fuck is that?
01:11:44 God Ren, okay.
01:11:47 Enby Friend, fine.
01:11:49 Epox?
01:11:50 What are you talking about?
01:11:51 Why are you in my house?
01:11:54 Wait.
01:11:55 Epo...
01:11:56 Cain or call?
01:11:57 Fiancé, fiancé.
01:11:58 Fiancé...
01:11:59 Wait, are those...
01:12:00 Do you have to say them different?
01:12:03 Where are you looking?
01:12:04 Epox.
01:12:05 Fiancé and fiancé.
01:12:08 Are they different words?
01:12:10 I didn't know they were gendered.
01:12:12 You know, um...
01:12:14 Like one has an extra E.
01:12:15 I think...
01:12:16 Yeah, I guess they are,
01:12:17 but I don't know if you say them differently.
01:12:20 Maybe in French you would.
01:12:22 Is it fiancé and fiancé?
01:12:24 Is that the difference?
01:12:25 That's the same.
01:12:26 It sounds the same.
01:12:27 No, it's...
01:12:28 It's an emphasis on the wrong syllable.
01:12:31 Fiancé and fiancé.
01:12:34 Law?
01:12:36 Sure.
01:12:37 Well, it's kind of like...
01:12:38 English.
01:12:39 Fiancé, fiancé.
01:12:40 You can say, you can say, you know,
01:12:42 my résumé or my résumé,
01:12:44 and both are acceptable.
01:12:46 Resumé, résumé.
01:12:47 Yeah, okay.
01:12:48 That's so similar, but sure, I guess.
01:12:51 I mean, surely you...
01:12:52 I mean...
01:12:53 Yeah.
01:12:54 Tiz?
01:12:56 Tiz.
01:12:57 For ma'am or service.
01:12:58 Some of these...
01:12:59 Some of these don't make any sense.
01:13:00 Like, I don't understand...
01:13:01 Yeah.
01:13:02 I don't understand what they're derived from,
01:13:03 and they don't...
01:13:04 Like, why would I say this?
01:13:07 Epos.
01:13:08 Goddex.
01:13:10 Goddex is kind of funny.
01:13:12 Goddex is funny.
01:13:16 Fenninbi.
01:13:18 I mean, okay.
01:13:19 I don't know about...
01:13:20 I don't mind, like, I don't...
01:13:21 I think I would refer to a gender-neutral god
01:13:23 as just a god.
01:13:24 I'm sorry.
01:13:25 I'm sorry to default male, but...
01:13:28 I mean...
01:13:30 I'm sorry, but the word goddess
01:13:31 is just the word for god
01:13:33 with a female attachment.
01:13:36 So just lose the attachments.
01:13:38 I think...
01:13:39 Yeah, there's a few things like that.
01:13:41 Like, I don't like the term comedian,
01:13:44 because comedian is...
01:13:46 I guess arguably male-centric,
01:13:49 but it's also just what you would call
01:13:52 somebody who does comedy.
01:13:54 Like, if they're neutral,
01:13:57 gender-neutral, I feel like comedian works.
01:13:59 Yeah, why do you need another word?
01:14:00 Comedian works for all genders and no gender,
01:14:02 and like...
01:14:04 You don't need to make a gendered version
01:14:06 for every possible permutation of a person.
01:14:09 That's exactly what the...
01:14:11 Like, chef doesn't have a female equivalent.
01:14:13 If you're a chef, you're a chef.
01:14:15 Well, we gotta make one.
01:14:16 No, we don't.
01:14:17 We gotta make one or else.
01:14:21 That's exactly what the person that retweeted
01:14:23 this list said.
01:14:24 They said,
01:14:25 why can't we just de-gender everything
01:14:27 instead of making everything third-gender?
01:14:29 Yeah.
01:14:30 I think that's probably...
01:14:32 That's probably right, yeah?
01:14:34 I mean, for some things,
01:14:36 like Mr. and Mrs.,
01:14:38 they are deliberately split-gender.
01:14:40 Yeah, we don't have to...
01:14:42 We don't have to remove every gender
01:14:44 under every circumstance.
01:14:46 But for some things,
01:14:48 like King Queen, we have monarch.
01:14:50 We don't need another one.
01:14:52 Yeah.
01:14:54 For God, I think we can just...
01:14:56 I think we can just dispense with the word goddess,
01:14:59 unless you really want it.
01:15:01 And then, it's fine.
01:15:03 I don't think we need...
01:15:05 We don't need God ex,
01:15:07 even though it's really funny.
01:15:09 I guess you would use goddess
01:15:11 when you're, like, looking at a beautiful woman
01:15:13 online and you want to say something to her.
01:15:15 You want to say,
01:15:17 you want to say,
01:15:19 I always find myself in that situation.
01:15:21 And yes, it's true.
01:15:22 It's a very useful word in that.
01:15:24 I mean,
01:15:26 I kind of get it.
01:15:28 It's like...
01:15:30 I guess it's a little uneven that, like,
01:15:32 you could call...
01:15:34 You could call Aphrodite a god.
01:15:36 I mean, she is.
01:15:38 You could also call her a goddess
01:15:40 if you want to be specific about it.
01:15:42 But there's no, like...
01:15:44 I don't... There's no masculine...
01:15:46 I feel like there's no masculine, like...
01:15:48 Oh, this is a god.
01:15:50 What's the...
01:15:54 Oh, shit.
01:15:56 What's the masculine suffix?
01:15:58 There is none.
01:16:00 We can make one of those.
01:16:02 Honestly, we should make one of those.
01:16:04 If we want equality,
01:16:06 let's just take God as the neutral one
01:16:08 and add a masculine suffix.
01:16:10 Goddick.
01:16:12 Godden.
01:16:14 Honestly, looking through these,
01:16:16 they have, like,
01:16:18 a consistency with Ren being a parent
01:16:20 and then grandparent
01:16:22 is a grandren.
01:16:24 Is it because it's a parent?
01:16:26 Oh, my goodness.
01:16:28 Probably.
01:16:30 I don't know if I like it.
01:16:32 Like, Ren!
01:16:34 It seems like you just picked something.
01:16:36 I don't want to go to school.
01:16:38 Ren!
01:16:40 Ren!
01:16:42 Like, instead of saying mom,
01:16:44 you would say that.
01:16:46 I think it's supposed to be a shortening of parent.
01:16:48 And I mean, I don't know what...
01:16:50 I honestly don't hate Ren
01:16:52 just because they've kept it
01:16:54 with, like, grandparent,
01:16:56 godparent.
01:16:58 I appreciate the consistency.
01:17:00 Like, if you wanted to invent a word
01:17:02 that means neither male
01:17:04 or female guardian parent
01:17:06 and shorten it so that you could say easily,
01:17:08 that's fine, I think.
01:17:10 I think that one's fine.
01:17:12 I don't understand Zeezy.
01:17:14 Zeezy, I don't know where that comes from.
01:17:16 Sprong is, like, Reddit.
01:17:18 You would just say kiddo.
01:17:20 Kiddo is good.
01:17:22 Kiddo is good.
01:17:24 Child.
01:17:26 Child.
01:17:28 Offspring.
01:17:30 Offspring is a bit clinical.
01:17:32 Sprong is...
01:17:34 Don't you think it sounds Reddit, though?
01:17:36 Sprong?
01:17:38 Sprong sounds very much like
01:17:40 someone who
01:17:42 oils their mustache
01:17:44 and wears...
01:17:46 and goes to fucking Renfair
01:17:48 LARP's
01:17:50 I guess I could say
01:17:52 that Sprong
01:17:54 is a funny thing.
01:17:56 It's a funny thing.
01:17:58 Sprong is wrong.
01:18:00 It's like a dad joke
01:18:02 or a Ren joke
01:18:04 when, like...
01:18:06 Oh, Spring has Sprong and they have a Sprong.
01:18:08 And the Sprong is like
01:18:10 fuck, shut up, Ren.
01:18:12 Shit.
01:18:14 God.
01:18:16 No, you shut up, Sprong.
01:18:18 Spring has Sprong.
01:18:20 A police report.
01:18:22 A police investigated
01:18:24 reports of domestic violence
01:18:26 between a Ren and their Sprong
01:18:28 today,
01:18:30 down on Main Street.
01:18:32 You know, it's grown on me.
01:18:34 Some of these are grown on me.
01:18:36 Sorry, I can't say
01:18:38 police because it's default mail.
01:18:40 I have to say a police ex.
01:18:42 I have to say police ex
01:18:44 because I don't want to be overly specific.
01:18:46 They have, like, police man, police woman,
01:18:48 so police
01:18:50 got a person, police ex.
01:18:52 Police Ren. Police Ren.
01:18:54 Police Ren.
01:18:56 Police ZZ.
01:18:58 Oh, wait, you say Jean Darme.
01:19:00 Or wait, that might be gendered, actually.
01:19:02 Man, sir, Tiz.
01:19:04 What is that?
01:19:06 What is that? I guess I just don't like the ones
01:19:08 that I don't know where they come from.
01:19:10 First of all,
01:19:12 frankly, too many of these have Z's
01:19:14 and X's in them.
01:19:16 Cringe. They love...
01:19:18 Cringe letter. Cringe letter. Try hard.
01:19:20 They love those letters. Don't like them.
01:19:22 Second of all,
01:19:24 I'm sorry, imagine.
01:19:26 Imagine you fucking go to a fancy
01:19:28 ball
01:19:30 and you go to the frickin'
01:19:32 and you're going in and they're taking your coat
01:19:34 and they're like, mm, and the fucking
01:19:36 butler is like, offers you
01:19:38 an hors d'oeuvre and they say, mm,
01:19:40 caviar, Tiz? Cause they don't know your gender.
01:19:42 I would kill myself.
01:19:44 Tiz? Tiz
01:19:46 Tiz sounds like coze, like it's too
01:19:48 informal.
01:19:50 Like, man, sir, man, sir
01:19:52 doesn't sound like them.
01:19:54 It sounds like it was completely made up out of
01:19:56 whole cloth and the fact that I see no
01:19:58 like, connection to the existing
01:20:00 vocabulary at all
01:20:02 is the most annoying thing about it.
01:20:04 Tiz this your order?
01:20:06 Yes, it is.
01:20:08 I think it's like,
01:20:10 it's Tiz.
01:20:12 It's not,
01:20:14 it's too similar to different words.
01:20:16 Yeah,
01:20:18 I also agree with that as well.
01:20:20 Lord and lady, lardy,
01:20:22 lardy, lardy is
01:20:24 not a good way to say it.
01:20:26 Lard, lard. Honestly, that one I
01:20:28 understand, they're just kind of combining the words.
01:20:30 Like, okay, I get it.
01:20:32 M'lard.
01:20:34 It's basically you're trying to sing both of them at the same time.
01:20:36 I see the logic.
01:20:38 I see the logic.
01:20:44 Feel free to spread this, it says,
01:20:46 and I did, so.
01:20:48 Spread it on some toast.
01:20:54 Yo, it's time for my oatmeal
01:20:56 update. I got new flavors
01:20:58 of better stevia
01:21:00 and none of them are as good
01:21:02 as the old ones.
01:21:04 So, that's it
01:21:06 for this week's oatmeal update.
01:21:08 The flavors I was somewhat disappointed by
01:21:10 are lemon
01:21:12 and hazelnut. They're fine.
01:21:16 Did I mention, I put raspberries in it.
01:21:18 I tried raspberries.
01:21:20 In oatmeal?
01:21:22 Yeah, like I put them in the vessel
01:21:24 and I mashed them
01:21:26 and then I combined, I put the oatmeal in,
01:21:28 mixed it as usual, added some
01:21:30 Greek yogurt, because it increases
01:21:32 the protein.
01:21:34 I replaced a little bit of it. What would have
01:21:36 an almond milk? I had some Greek yogurt.
01:21:38 And I added some stevia to the, oh my god.
01:21:40 Oh my god, the raspberries
01:21:42 with the stevia in there.
01:21:44 That's incredible, incredible.
01:21:46 An incredible inclusion. I think I said
01:21:48 on a previous episode, someone asked
01:21:50 favorite fruit and I was a little bit mixed on raspberries.
01:21:52 Yeah, yeah.
01:21:54 They are very sharp though,
01:21:56 so you do need that sugary.
01:21:58 I still wouldn't just eat them plain.
01:22:00 No, you need them with something sweet.
01:22:02 Yeah.
01:22:04 I like that I
01:22:06 mashed them up and their flavor was
01:22:08 included.
01:22:10 It really worked. It really was doing a lot for me.
01:22:12 Yeah, raspberries, like swirl ice cream is very nice.
01:22:14 I want to try,
01:22:16 I want to try getting strawberries. I'll try it
01:22:18 with strawberries. I'll get some fresh ones
01:22:20 and I'll mash them and mix them in and see
01:22:22 how that works. It'll probably be pretty good.
01:22:24 Raspberry yogurt is good.
01:22:26 Well, like I said, I had some
01:22:28 I had some yogurt in there.
01:22:30 It really worked.
01:22:32 It really did.
01:22:34 Okay,
01:22:36 that's my yogurt update.
01:22:38 The oat update turned into a yogurt update.
01:22:40 Dang it, I said yogurt.
01:22:42 Like a fucking weirdo, like a freak.
01:22:44 It's yogurt.
01:22:46 Yeah, colonize.
01:22:48 Get colonized.
01:22:50 I'm so embarrassed.
01:22:52 Uh,
01:22:54 um,
01:22:56 is it too early to talk about One Piece?
01:22:58 Um,
01:23:00 do you have nothing else to talk about?
01:23:02 What are your losers? Nothing else to talk about
01:23:04 for a week?
01:23:06 Yes.
01:23:08 Yes, whatever.
01:23:10 Now I have to show that I'm cooler by having
01:23:12 something to talk about, but I can't
01:23:14 bring anything forward.
01:23:16 No.
01:23:18 Uh, I'll say
01:23:20 no.
01:23:22 My exercise routine
01:23:24 is going really well.
01:23:26 My squat.
01:23:28 If you must know, thanks for asking.
01:23:30 220.
01:23:32 220 on the squat. That's pretty good.
01:23:34 220 squats?
01:23:36 Yeah.
01:23:38 No pounds.
01:23:40 Oh, sorry. Kilograms.
01:23:42 Those are different denominations.
01:23:44 He's keeping track.
01:23:46 Um,
01:23:48 220 pounds, 220 pounds, which is
01:23:50 uh, is good.
01:23:52 Uh, 225
01:23:54 is the line for two plate.
01:23:56 That's when I can officially say that I squat two plate,
01:23:58 which is a good milestone.
01:24:00 Um,
01:24:02 so I look,
01:24:04 I look good.
01:24:06 I look good, looking in the mirror.
01:24:08 I weighed myself and I was like, oh, damn,
01:24:10 I gained some weight.
01:24:12 But then I would look in the mirror and I was like, oh, but I don't look like I gained some weight.
01:24:14 He's got some muscle on you.
01:24:16 Actually, I look fucking ripped.
01:24:18 Actually, fucking ripped.
01:24:20 And you know what it is? I think
01:24:22 I'm taking more care with my diet this time.
01:24:24 This time I'm specifically
01:24:26 I'm like hitting, hitting
01:24:28 like a certain amount of protein
01:24:30 every day. I think I did not, in previous
01:24:32 times that I've been lifting,
01:24:34 I think I did not take care to like
01:24:36 make sure I was getting the protein I needed.
01:24:38 And I think that probably
01:24:40 hamstrung me considerably
01:24:42 in terms of gains.
01:24:44 It's a very important aspect.
01:24:46 This time I'm serious. I'm serious about
01:24:48 gains.
01:24:50 You can't increase your bulk
01:24:52 unless you put some bulk in your gob.
01:24:56 That's, put that on a shirt.
01:24:58 We can put that on again.
01:25:00 Put that on the fucking cover of
01:25:02 the perfect comic party.
01:25:04 The perfect comic party.
01:25:06 It's bulk for your gob.
01:25:08 Hmm.
01:25:12 It's gonna be good. It's gonna be good.
01:25:14 I guess the only thing I can talk about
01:25:16 is I'm
01:25:18 still doing that RuneScape
01:25:20 challenge. God still?
01:25:22 Yeah. I go on every so often
01:25:24 like a couple hours
01:25:26 listening to a video
01:25:28 and I'm like getting coal
01:25:30 and I'm mining
01:25:32 and who boy? I've got 33,000
01:25:34 pieces of coal right now.
01:25:36 I can't judge because I did play
01:25:38 Noida this week
01:25:40 against my better judgment.
01:25:42 See the thing with Noida is you play a game
01:25:44 and then you finish it.
01:25:46 But with RuneScape it never ends.
01:25:48 I'm constantly gaining more power.
01:25:50 It's like if I was playing Noida
01:25:52 but I was continually just like,
01:25:54 alright now I'll get back in there
01:25:56 and I'll go scavenge some more
01:25:58 some more fluids. Some more rare fluids
01:26:00 in my vessel.
01:26:02 My bank is getting filled with coal
01:26:04 and the bank tells like what the fuck
01:26:06 but they have to do it.
01:26:08 What's your aim? What's your next short term
01:26:10 aim for RuneScape
01:26:12 that you're collecting?
01:26:14 The big thing is the coal
01:26:16 because I need like
01:26:18 235k
01:26:20 235,000 coal
01:26:22 for the challenge.
01:26:24 Remind me what the ultimate goal
01:26:26 is again. It's to get all
01:26:28 of the materials I would need
01:26:30 to switch
01:26:32 to members
01:26:34 and level fletching
01:26:36 from level 1 to level 99
01:26:38 in one big go
01:26:40 by gathering materials
01:26:42 in free to play
01:26:44 which is a stupid very time consuming
01:26:46 way to do leveling fletching
01:26:48 but that's why it's fun.
01:26:50 That's why it's silly.
01:26:52 I understand.
01:26:54 So I've got like
01:26:56 I've got a bunch of coal
01:26:58 to get, some adamantine oil
01:27:00 and a bunch of runite ore.
01:27:02 I think the next milestone
01:27:04 might actually be hitting
01:27:06 like max level mining because that
01:27:08 I've calculated that I will get that
01:27:10 much.
01:27:12 Which is a lot because the levels
01:27:14 of the experience you need increases
01:27:16 exponentially
01:27:18 for each level.
01:27:22 So it's a lot of mining
01:27:26 and I get like
01:27:28 150 on average
01:27:30 per hour
01:27:32 and so to get
01:27:34 200,000
01:27:36 it takes a little while.
01:27:38 It takes a number of hours
01:27:40 and I'm probably gonna
01:27:42 not be... A number?
01:27:44 I can't remember. I think if I get what...
01:27:46 What number?
01:27:48 If I get a thousand coal, that's like
01:27:50 a little...
01:27:52 I think that's like three hours in a little bit.
01:27:54 So if I play three hours a day
01:27:56 then I get
01:27:58 a thousand coal
01:28:00 then I would need to play three hours a day
01:28:02 for 200 days
01:28:04 which is
01:28:06 you know
01:28:08 a mental arithmetic
01:28:10 you know?
01:28:12 I can't do mental arithmetic so I don't know
01:28:14 what that means. 200 days is most of a year?
01:28:16 Yeah.
01:28:18 If I play three hours a day which I will not
01:28:20 be able to do.
01:28:22 Right. Yeah.
01:28:24 And
01:28:26 I'm gonna have to... It's gonna take
01:28:28 playing through the whole battle network series
01:28:30 is gonna take
01:28:32 several hundred hours
01:28:34 of actively playing
01:28:36 the games
01:28:38 so that's gonna be...
01:28:40 Yeah.
01:28:42 And I'm not gonna be able to do that
01:28:44 every day. I might... I was hoping to do
01:28:46 a couple hours a day, a couple times a week
01:28:48 so that would end up being
01:28:50 I don't know if it's like 500 hours
01:28:52 maybe it'll be three...
01:28:54 Let's see. If there's 11...
01:28:56 If there's about 11 games in the series
01:28:58 and they're all roughly around
01:29:00 say 25...
01:29:02 let's average it out to like 25 hours
01:29:04 let's call that 300 hours
01:29:06 and if I did
01:29:08 6 hours a week
01:29:10 2-3 hours sessions
01:29:12 that would come to 6 hours a week
01:29:14 so 50 weeks
01:29:16 oh god it'll take a whole fucking year!
01:29:18 Yeah.
01:29:20 It's...
01:29:22 It's over!
01:29:24 Maybe consider
01:29:26 a lecture you can do in the meantime.
01:29:28 Oh, yeah.
01:29:30 Yeah.
01:29:32 Definitely. I was
01:29:34 aware this would take a long time and I was gonna
01:29:36 have to do something else in the meantime.
01:29:40 Speaking of which...
01:29:42 Oh, one last thing before I move on from
01:29:44 RuneScape is
01:29:46 that 350
01:29:48 per hour is the average based on
01:29:50 my current mining level.
01:29:52 But as I increase in level
01:29:54 the percentage chance
01:29:56 to get coal per swing
01:29:58 increases.
01:30:00 So as I get to level 99
01:30:02 the average will get
01:30:04 higher. So my calculations are gonna be
01:30:08 it's actually gonna be a little less
01:30:10 than my calculations would
01:30:12 say.
01:30:14 So it might not be
01:30:16 a whole year.
01:30:18 It might be that in like
01:30:20 9 months it'll be done.
01:30:22 Lemau.
01:30:24 That's great.
01:30:26 But that's only the coal. Then there's
01:30:28 like the chickens. I need to kill like
01:30:30 thousands upon thousands of chickens to get
01:30:32 the feathers I need for the arrows.
01:30:34 Thank god.
01:30:36 I know. It's really silly.
01:30:38 I don't mind how long it takes.
01:30:40 Everybody needs a hobby I guess.
01:30:42 Yeah. People like
01:30:44 they play a game
01:30:46 and they enjoy themselves.
01:30:48 I'm playing RuneScape.
01:30:50 Shut up.
01:30:52 I agree.
01:30:54 Shut up.
01:30:56 Speaking of
01:30:58 a lecture to do in the
01:31:00 meantime while I'm working on getting that
01:31:02 ready.
01:31:04 I am so close.
01:31:06 I have only about 18 gigs
01:31:08 left to download via
01:31:10 Torrent
01:31:12 of the entire Digibro archive.
01:31:14 I will soon be one of the few
01:31:16 cedars
01:31:18 of all the content in the Digibro
01:31:20 archive which is almost a terabyte
01:31:22 of data. Actually I think it's more than
01:31:24 a terabyte.
01:31:26 You're going to have that
01:31:28 on a hard drive.
01:31:30 Yeah.
01:31:32 I think I basically
01:31:34 asked for
01:31:36 an external hard drive for
01:31:38 Christmas for my parents
01:31:40 specifically so I could store
01:31:42 this stuff.
01:31:44 Well I started
01:31:46 Torrenting it and as I was Torrenting it
01:31:48 I realized
01:31:50 I already have
01:31:52 a lot of the
01:31:54 space on my
01:31:56 extra hard drive was taken up with the Mega Man
01:31:58 stuff. I'm actually going to need another one
01:32:00 but I got another one and it's pretty much
01:32:02 all just going to go on there.
01:32:04 I can't wait for the OVA to be...
01:32:06 It has been downloading
01:32:08 for literally like six weeks now
01:32:10 and it's finally about to be done
01:32:12 like today.
01:32:14 I can't wait for the OVA to be finished
01:32:16 so that I can take all of that footage
01:32:18 off the hard drive that I have
01:32:20 just because I kept it as backup
01:32:22 you know. Didn't want to delete it
01:32:24 in case it was a catastrophic failure
01:32:26 and someone needed to get
01:32:28 the footage back.
01:32:30 Yeah.
01:32:32 We should release the behind
01:32:34 the scenes footage though. We should make
01:32:36 it like a bonus thing.
01:32:40 Yeah.
01:32:42 Of course.
01:32:44 Behind the scenes meaning like
01:32:46 flubbed takes
01:32:48 or is there more specific?
01:32:50 Well you have all the raw footage right?
01:32:54 I don't want to look at it.
01:32:56 You know, I understand.
01:33:00 But I do think
01:33:02 patrons would appreciate it and
01:33:04 find it funny.
01:33:06 I guess so.
01:33:08 I'll see how the OVA shakes
01:33:10 out. I don't know what takes are being
01:33:12 used and what's already been going to be seen.
01:33:14 You know
01:33:16 I don't know how much
01:33:18 unused footage there
01:33:20 will be.
01:33:22 Some takes we just did
01:33:24 like twice.
01:33:26 And there wasn't like a lot of camera
01:33:28 running in between.
01:33:30 Might not
01:33:32 might not be that much. I'm not sure.
01:33:36 We'll definitely do a commentary
01:33:38 of it. There'll be something.
01:33:40 Yeah, I think that'll be good.
01:33:42 I think that'll be funny and good.
01:33:44 And I wish
01:33:46 Kaiju would
01:33:48 finish drawing the cover. I might
01:33:50 give him a bell.
01:33:52 Give him a ring. Give him a little buzz.
01:33:54 I did like weeks, like a couple weeks ago.
01:33:56 And he was like, yep, I'll do it.
01:33:58 Okay.
01:34:00 I might just
01:34:02 ask someone else.
01:34:04 I asked someone else before
01:34:06 and they kind of never got back to me.
01:34:08 And I sort of dropped it because it seemed like Kaiju
01:34:10 was back on the case. I might ask them again
01:34:12 like, hey, do you want to draw the cover?
01:34:14 Just for the cover.
01:34:16 What have you got so far?
01:34:18 Maybe they've done a little sketch
01:34:20 and they just haven't got around to it.
01:34:22 Ed did like a very rough sketch
01:34:24 like almost like not even
01:34:26 really worth
01:34:28 using.
01:34:30 I had one
01:34:32 person in mind who I thought would
01:34:34 make a really good cover.
01:34:36 Maybe I'll ask them again.
01:34:38 Because they said that they were kind of busy the last time I asked.
01:34:40 But it's been a while, so.
01:34:48 Yep.
01:34:50 I mean, whenever, if you decide
01:34:52 to talk to someone else,
01:34:54 you should mention to Kaiju
01:34:56 that you don't need their services.
01:34:58 Yeah, yeah, of course. If someone else agreed to do it,
01:35:00 I'd be like, hey, dog, never mind.
01:35:02 Hey, don't worry about it. Hey, you're done. Hey, I can pay you now.
01:35:04 Kaiju told me that he didn't want to be paid
01:35:06 until he finished everything.
01:35:08 That was his decision.
01:35:10 So I haven't paid him anything.
01:35:16 Wish he would do the cover
01:35:18 so I could, one, so it would be done
01:35:20 and also so I could pay him.
01:35:22 Again, that was his,
01:35:24 he specifically said
01:35:26 I would, I don't,
01:35:28 don't pay me until I've completed the tab.
01:35:30 Okay.
01:35:32 You know, I,
01:35:34 I don't know about that.
01:35:36 I feel like you should pay someone.
01:35:40 That's what he said.
01:35:42 No, no, I mean like, because
01:35:44 if there's no money
01:35:46 until they finish it,
01:35:48 there's no
01:35:51 Well, I don't know.
01:35:54 I don't know what to tell you.
01:35:56 I don't know how, like
01:35:58 there's something in my brain that says
01:36:00 it would be, they would
01:36:02 do it more quicker
01:36:04 if they were paid, not because
01:36:06 they were
01:36:08 like, I don't know.
01:36:12 I feel like a little bit, I feel like a little bit
01:36:14 that saying don't pay me is an excuse
01:36:16 for taking a really long time on it.
01:36:18 Maybe.
01:36:20 Maybe it's just insurance, like
01:36:22 I don't know whether I'll have the time, which is fair enough.
01:36:24 But still.
01:36:28 Everyone takes so dang long.
01:36:32 This whole dojin's been like
01:36:34 a really long process.
01:36:36 Yeah, Nightmare.
01:36:42 The, uh, the
01:36:44 I
01:36:46 I would, I would have been happy to
01:36:48 just pay on a page by page
01:36:50 basis.
01:36:52 But he didn't want me to.
01:36:54 Take the money, you fool.
01:36:56 I mean, he will
01:36:58 hopefully at some point
01:37:00 if I, if I, if I get
01:37:02 someone else to do the cover, I'll just tell him like
01:37:04 hey, never mind, I'm going to pay you now.
01:37:06 I'm paying you, I insist
01:37:08 I will pay you now and not
01:37:10 later, no matter what you have to
01:37:12 say about it.
01:37:22 It's so close. It's literally
01:37:24 the cover is the only thing left.
01:37:26 I think.
01:37:32 Okay.
01:37:34 I'm out of stuff to talk about
01:37:36 other than one piece.
01:37:38 Okay, I guess.
01:37:40 Okay, and I feel like, I feel like
01:37:42 more happened this week.
01:37:44 Like I said, it felt like a lot
01:37:46 happened, but I didn't do anything.
01:37:48 Well, I mean, what happened?
01:37:50 Was there like an event?
01:37:52 Did somebody vent? Was somebody sus?
01:37:54 Oh, I think we're, um, I think we're
01:37:56 rent striking.
01:37:58 I think we're rent striking at my landlord.
01:38:00 Oh.
01:38:02 Because, um, there's still rats in the house
01:38:04 and, uh,
01:38:06 he hasn't, he has made like only the
01:38:08 most cursory
01:38:10 efforts to do anything about them.
01:38:12 Totally, totally inadequate.
01:38:14 Hmm.
01:38:16 That's a pretty good reason.
01:38:18 Yeah. Um, so I think, uh,
01:38:20 everyone is just not paying rent
01:38:22 until he does something about it.
01:38:24 I think that's the, the plan.
01:38:26 You gotta stop the scabs coming in
01:38:28 and paying rent for you.
01:38:30 Well, one guy is
01:38:32 going to do that for sure.
01:38:34 Well, pay for rent for everyone?
01:38:36 No. Oh, oh, for everyone, no.
01:38:38 There's one guy who's not here.
01:38:40 Like, he's not even around,
01:38:42 but he's still, like, technically
01:38:44 renting a room. So he'll probably
01:38:46 pay rent because, like, none of us have spoken to him.
01:38:48 But, like, the rest of us, I think we're all,
01:38:50 we all spoke and we're in agreement.
01:38:52 Like, we gotta stop paying rent until
01:38:54 he does something about this.
01:38:56 So I'll watch the...
01:38:58 Fortunately, I can see
01:39:00 it's there, it's public information
01:39:02 for all of us. We can log in and we can see
01:39:04 who has paid already.
01:39:06 So I'll be able to see, like,
01:39:08 if anyone breaks strike.
01:39:10 Like, if any, like, if other people pay,
01:39:12 I won't be, like, the only one
01:39:14 left. Cause I'm not willing to be
01:39:16 the only guy to do it.
01:39:18 I need, I need solidarity.
01:39:20 Yeah, solidarity. Exactly, exactly.
01:39:22 If somebody pays rent, you know who to lynch,
01:39:24 you know who to get. Absolutely.
01:39:26 So if everyone caves,
01:39:28 then I will also cave.
01:39:30 But I'm not, I'm not going to be the first one.
01:39:32 I'm going to wait until other...
01:39:34 Yeah, I'm not crossing the
01:39:36 picket line.
01:39:38 The first person who does will be
01:39:40 hanging from the tree by a harbor
01:39:42 a green forest cable
01:39:44 with their boots on.
01:39:46 Yes. Good, good.
01:39:48 They'll still...
01:39:50 And then the landlord will be like, uh-huh,
01:39:52 I love the reference.
01:39:56 Cool. The landlord will be like,
01:39:58 I love the, I love the reference.
01:40:00 Uh, yeah, you know, I know I'm a landlord,
01:40:02 but like, I'm still a little bit of like a base socialist,
01:40:04 you know, like, yeah, I play Disco Elysium.
01:40:08 They play Disco Elysium and they're on
01:40:10 they're on the side of the
01:40:12 strike breakers.
01:40:14 Yeah, they're... Union busters.
01:40:16 They're an ultra liberal.
01:40:18 They're a, they're a...
01:40:22 What's the other one?
01:40:24 Omega liberal?
01:40:26 No, you haven't met
01:40:28 the...
01:40:30 There's one guy in particular
01:40:32 who, what's it called?
01:40:36 Moral intern. The moral intern.
01:40:38 What's that mean?
01:40:40 Ultra liberal is like
01:40:44 libertarian, like economics.
01:40:48 Moral intern is like
01:40:50 a sort of
01:40:52 interventionist
01:40:54 sort of
01:40:56 like, we have to control the economy.
01:40:58 We have to like, regulate the economy
01:41:00 to make sure that nothing...
01:41:04 I think you're, I think you're close to meeting
01:41:06 someone who will explain moral intern
01:41:08 probably better than I can. It's all about the price
01:41:10 stability. You must maintain
01:41:12 the price stability.
01:41:14 You gotta keep inflation under two percent.
01:41:16 Just under. Never over. The stability.
01:41:18 The price stability.
01:41:22 If the price of bread goes up, that's it.
01:41:24 That's over.
01:41:28 Did you see
01:41:30 that fucking
01:41:32 drawing of the girl from
01:41:34 fucking
01:41:36 Spy Family
01:41:38 at Auschwitz?
01:41:40 What?
01:41:42 Dog shit. It's dog shit.
01:41:44 I don't know.
01:41:46 Artist is a hack.
01:41:48 Spy Family is that, that's the new,
01:41:50 that's the relatively new anime with the
01:41:52 girl. Okay.
01:41:54 It's that one artist who likes to draw
01:41:56 like, ha ha
01:41:58 this is their stick.
01:42:00 They'll draw, they'll paint
01:42:02 a popular anime character, a cute
01:42:04 anime girl, and when you look
01:42:06 at it for a second, it's kind of just like
01:42:08 a normal drawing of a cute anime girl,
01:42:10 and then you'll notice some background
01:42:12 details that suggest some dark
01:42:14 shit going on, like they're being domestically
01:42:16 abused, or they're getting a blow job
01:42:18 under the table, or
01:42:20 ha ha, she's going to Auschwitz.
01:42:22 It's so random.
01:42:24 It's so random and dark and edgy and funny.
01:42:26 Yeah, I think I know what
01:42:28 artist that is.
01:42:30 It's just lame. I don't like it.
01:42:32 And I think a lot of people, honestly
01:42:34 I read the replies, and a lot of people seem
01:42:36 offended, and they're like,
01:42:38 genuinely a lot of them were like, you can't
01:42:40 post this on freaking
01:42:42 Holocaust Remembrance Day.
01:42:44 And like, okay,
01:42:46 I guess I get that.
01:42:48 But that's not where I'm at
01:42:50 with it.
01:42:52 Where I'm at with it is that I can't
01:42:54 possibly feel anything about it, because
01:42:56 it's so...
01:42:58 It's so...
01:43:00 It doesn't mean anything.
01:43:02 It's just all noise and no signal.
01:43:04 It's...
01:43:06 A lot of their work, assuming we're talking
01:43:08 about the same person, a lot of their work
01:43:10 just sort of feels like
01:43:12 oh, this is an edgy teenager.
01:43:14 This is an edgy teenage boy
01:43:16 exactly, and they want to
01:43:18 say the end word so bad
01:43:20 they love the idea of saying the end word,
01:43:22 but they can't do it.
01:43:24 I drew a popular waifu
01:43:26 with Vladimir Putin.
01:43:28 Isn't that so fucked up?
01:43:30 It works, too.
01:43:32 People get mad at it, and that's what
01:43:34 they want. And I wish...
01:43:36 I don't know.
01:43:38 It's really dumb. It's a really dumb shtick.
01:43:40 Yeah.
01:43:42 Get better material.
01:43:44 Uh...
01:43:48 Whatever. I just want to complain.
01:43:50 Just want to complain about some shit
01:43:52 that I don't like.
01:43:54 And that's one of them.
01:43:56 But I'm not triggered.
01:43:58 But I'm not triggered, though.
01:44:00 I promise.
01:44:02 I don't know. Your voice is trembling.
01:44:04 Don't print in the news that I'm triggered.
01:44:06 I mean that I wasn't triggered.
01:44:08 I mean, shit.
01:44:10 No, I like the holocaust, actually.
01:44:12 It's good, actually.
01:44:14 Trust me, that's not the problem.
01:44:16 Trust me. Trust me.
01:44:18 It's not the problem.
01:44:20 Who's that?
01:44:22 I don't know.
01:44:24 That was me trying to emulate, like,
01:44:26 hey, if I was a YouTuber and I was
01:44:28 reading a script and I thought,
01:44:30 the script is getting boring, maybe I should
01:44:32 punch that by having a zoom in on my face
01:44:34 and, like, I'd make my voice really deep
01:44:36 for a second, and maybe I, like, reverse
01:44:38 the colors or something.
01:44:40 That's what that was.
01:44:42 In case you couldn't tell.
01:44:44 Sure.
01:44:46 In case it wasn't blindingly obvious.
01:44:50 I guess they're continuing
01:44:52 Rick and Morty without Justin Roiland's
01:44:54 lull.
01:44:56 Yeah, I don't...
01:44:58 I saw, like, people's reactions to the news
01:45:00 and never looked up the news.
01:45:02 Justin Roiland did a sexual
01:45:04 harassment or something.
01:45:06 I thought he beat his wife.
01:45:08 How do you do
01:45:10 Rick and Morty without Justin Roiland?
01:45:12 Isn't that, like...
01:45:14 I kind of think...
01:45:16 The voices. I guess you could...
01:45:18 You're right. That kind of is the show.
01:45:20 That's kind of, like, the heart and soul of the show is
01:45:22 the voices of Rick and Morty.
01:45:24 The voices and the
01:45:26 delivery is...
01:45:28 I mean, I know you can emulate it.
01:45:30 You could get a guy who does the voice, but, like,
01:45:32 the sense of humor as well.
01:45:34 I feel like it's going to be...
01:45:36 The new season's going to come out
01:45:38 and, uh, you're going to be...
01:45:40 Everyone's going to be able to tell.
01:45:42 Everyone's going to be able to tell. It's not the same.
01:45:44 Oh, hey, Morty.
01:45:46 And it's going to be really embarrassing.
01:45:48 Hey, Morty, burp. It's me, Rick.
01:45:52 Rick?
01:45:54 It just tunes the names.
01:45:56 I'm German. I'm German.
01:45:58 Morty, it's me.
01:46:00 I'm not Rick. I'm German, Rick.
01:46:02 I'm Rick, Morty.
01:46:04 I'm Rick.
01:46:06 Rick and Morty comes back, but it's just, like,
01:46:08 super right-wing now.
01:46:10 Justin Rowland's gone,
01:46:12 and it's worse.
01:46:14 You thought Justin Rowland was bad.
01:46:16 He was gatekeeping out the worst
01:46:18 and the most toxic elements.
01:46:20 You don't know how bad it could have been
01:46:22 without him.
01:46:24 You'll wish we had Justin back.
01:46:26 Um...
01:46:28 I haven't been keeping up with the show.
01:46:30 No, I didn't watch the last season.
01:46:32 I watched was the one where
01:46:34 the
01:46:36 finite curve
01:46:38 and, like, the Morty
01:46:40 guy,
01:46:42 he went through to the different dimension
01:46:44 where there's no Rick
01:46:46 or something.
01:46:48 The central finite curve was, like,
01:46:50 a lore thing where, like,
01:46:52 Rick Sanchez has the portal gun
01:46:54 that only goes to other universes
01:46:56 where Rick is the coolest guy,
01:46:58 and it blocks out all the universes
01:47:00 without that.
01:47:02 And so the Morty is Morty.
01:47:04 Not the Morty is Morty, but, like, the Evil Morty
01:47:06 does the thing where he turns
01:47:08 the
01:47:10 Sanctuary of Rick's or whatever
01:47:12 into, like, a
01:47:14 way to zap himself into
01:47:16 a universe
01:47:18 that doesn't have Rick as the coolest guy,
01:47:20 and then Morty could be the coolest guy
01:47:22 or something. He escaped.
01:47:24 He escaped the curse of Rick.
01:47:26 And I was like, oh, cool.
01:47:28 Follow up. I wonder if they did something.
01:47:30 I wonder if it was good.
01:47:32 I don't know if it is.
01:47:34 I think I heard, uh, I kind of saw
01:47:36 people being mostly, like, positive
01:47:38 about the latest season, like, not that
01:47:40 long ago, I think.
01:47:42 Yeah. Not sure.
01:47:44 I'll go back and watch it, but, like,
01:47:46 that's funny. That's funny that Justin
01:47:48 Royland fucked everything up by being
01:47:50 terrible.
01:47:52 I think he did, like,
01:47:54 felony domestic abuse.
01:47:56 I think that's what it was.
01:48:00 I mean, I think he also
01:48:02 was, like, sexting
01:48:04 minors, but I don't think that's
01:48:06 what, like, the legal charges
01:48:08 are about.
01:48:10 Hmm.
01:48:14 I think?
01:48:16 Yeah.
01:48:18 Yeah, I don't know anything
01:48:20 about it, so I'm not going to talk.
01:48:22 Talk out my AS.
01:48:24 Um,
01:48:26 whatever. You know what? I don't
01:48:28 care. I don't care if frickin' Morty gets
01:48:30 canceled. I don't care if Justin Royland gets
01:48:32 fired. They peaked with Pickle Rick. It's okay.
01:48:34 They peaked with Pickle Rick!
01:48:36 Um, it's fine.
01:48:38 You know what? Um, I don't even, like,
01:48:40 shows anyway, so when they get canceled,
01:48:42 I think it's good. Um,
01:48:44 it makes me happy.
01:48:46 People keep on trying to show me
01:48:48 stuff. I'm, like, nothing, please.
01:48:50 No. More content.
01:48:52 Unironically, yes, only
01:48:54 people have stopped trying to show me.
01:48:56 Hahaha.
01:48:58 Just what I always...
01:49:00 I like oblivion. I like the
01:49:02 abyss. I like oblivion, too.
01:49:04 That guy always makes good voicemails.
01:49:06 That guy's always making a good funny voicemail.
01:49:08 Hey, remember? Oh, I was thinking of a video game.
01:49:10 Uh, hey, remember,
01:49:12 uh, like, last week in the voicemails
01:49:14 when
01:49:16 TinCannMan revealed himself to have
01:49:18 been oblivionfall all along?
01:49:20 No, it's not true. It was a
01:49:22 it was a trick.
01:49:24 Well, I,
01:49:26 I was taught, you know, I went on the,
01:49:28 I was on the drawcast. We did the edgy
01:49:30 character's drawcast, which I'm not sure
01:49:32 if that's out yet or when it will be out.
01:49:34 Actually, I have, I forgot to follow up
01:49:36 on that. Um, but
01:49:38 I was on that and we recorded
01:49:40 it, and during the course of it, I
01:49:42 asked oblivionfall about it, or I mentioned
01:49:44 it, and oblivionfall was like, what the hell?
01:49:46 Some guy asked me
01:49:48 to say that like months ago
01:49:50 and I forgot about it. Oh,
01:49:52 he got played.
01:49:54 So like, like, he
01:49:56 he mentioned something and I, and I mentioned, oh
01:49:58 yeah, that voicemail you did. And he was like, what
01:50:00 voicemail? I didn't do a voicemail. And I was like, yeah
01:50:02 you did. You, you, you said
01:50:04 you were, had been TinCannMan all
01:50:06 along and he was like, what? Yeah.
01:50:08 I can't believe TinCannMan was
01:50:10 the mastermind behind that one.
01:50:12 Played, played, outplayed,
01:50:14 outmatched, outgunned.
01:50:16 So powerful. We, we, we, we
01:50:18 we were so, we, we didn't
01:50:20 uh, expect so uh, that much
01:50:22 of TinCannMan, but we, we
01:50:24 we saw it coming. We were shown, we were shown up.
01:50:26 He's a genius.
01:50:28 You know, he is a genius.
01:50:30 He put it like that.
01:50:32 I'm watching my, I'm watching
01:50:34 my uh, Digi
01:50:36 Archive.
01:50:38 It is five parts.
01:50:40 Four of them are complete.
01:50:42 The biggest one, part four
01:50:44 which is called
01:50:46 collaboration is still downloading.
01:50:48 It has been downloading for six weeks and six
01:50:50 days. Five. It is
01:50:52 it is six hundred and sixty-eight gigabytes.
01:50:54 Uh, the connect,
01:50:56 I'm not sure, I don't think it's on my end, but
01:50:58 like the connection keeps like popping in.
01:51:00 The download keeps stopping and starting and stopping
01:51:02 and starting. Uh,
01:51:04 but uh, it is at six hundred and
01:51:06 fifty gigabytes of
01:51:08 six hundred and sixty-eight gigabytes have been
01:51:10 downloaded at ninety-seven point two percent.
01:51:12 It is so close.
01:51:14 I could taste it.
01:51:16 What does collaborations mean? Is that like
01:51:18 videos in which
01:51:20 she appears in other people's videos
01:51:22 or with other people in them?
01:51:24 I guess so. Like with the PCP?
01:51:26 Uh,
01:51:28 I don't, I don't know.
01:51:30 Maybe. Maybe includes
01:51:32 all the pub crawl.
01:51:34 This, this is like by far the biggest.
01:51:36 I think that one of the other parts is four
01:51:38 hundred gigs and then all the other ones are
01:51:40 like a hundred.
01:51:42 The other ones are like much smaller.
01:51:44 There's like the pub crawl and the
01:51:46 appearances on the dick show and
01:51:48 like I'm trying to think of
01:51:50 like how is it so much bigger?
01:51:52 Well no, there was another, one of the other parts
01:51:54 um,
01:51:56 is called, okay well the parts are
01:51:58 one, the digi collective,
01:52:00 which I'm pretty sure means the main channel.
01:52:02 And then part two is
01:52:04 other digi channels, which I think means
01:52:06 you know, like other.
01:52:08 Digi after dark.
01:52:10 Digi does that.
01:52:12 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:52:14 And then part three is called featuring digi,
01:52:16 which I would assume means
01:52:18 like appearances
01:52:20 on other people, in other people's videos
01:52:22 on other people's channels.
01:52:24 And then part four is called collaboration,
01:52:26 which
01:52:28 I would kind of think that
01:52:30 featuring digi would be
01:52:32 a part of that, but I guess not.
01:52:34 Maybe it's the other way around, like
01:52:36 digi featuring others.
01:52:38 Well, why wouldn't that go on digi collective?
01:52:40 Don't have that fucking know.
01:52:42 Yeah, I don't, I don't really get it.
01:52:44 And then part five is called mis, miscellaneous
01:52:46 content, which, you know, I don't know what
01:52:48 them.
01:52:50 Maybe collaborations is like
01:52:52 uh, digi bros, and
01:52:54 not Vic and Hope.
01:52:56 I guess digi bros, and then digi and may.
01:52:58 Other, other digi channels
01:53:00 is by far, that can't
01:53:02 be after dark, because it's by far the smallest.
01:53:04 It's only 40 gigs.
01:53:06 Uh, featuring digi is one
01:53:08 118, miscellaneous is
01:53:10 179, digi collective 476,
01:53:12 collaboration
01:53:14 668.
01:53:16 Uh...
01:53:18 Well, have fun looking at them.
01:53:20 In case you wondered, in case you wondered, but hey,
01:53:22 if anyone wants, if anyone is
01:53:24 thinking about getting
01:53:26 the digi archive for their very own,
01:53:28 if you torrent it,
01:53:30 I will be seeding it, because I will
01:53:32 have it as a very soon.
01:53:34 So you're welcome.
01:53:36 Um...
01:53:38 Before we get to one piece, I need to
01:53:40 pee again. Ah! Okay.
01:53:42 Let's do that.
01:53:44 Okay.
01:53:50 Okay, so
01:53:52 a couple people are
01:53:54 uh,
01:53:56 replying to my tweet about May with
01:53:58 some choice screenshots
01:54:00 of her tweets.
01:54:02 Now I gotta go and look.
01:54:04 Just a couple of
01:54:06 um, she recently
01:54:08 retweeted Sneeko.
01:54:10 Do you know who Sneeko is?
01:54:12 Sounds like a sneaky gay.
01:54:14 I think he's a streamer.
01:54:16 I guess he's popular now.
01:54:18 Seems like a little bit of a
01:54:20 fashion, honestly.
01:54:22 Seems like kind of a scumbag
01:54:24 fashion. Wait, Amanda Marce
01:54:26 has absconded.
01:54:28 Yes. It's a funny
01:54:30 word to use.
01:54:32 That is a funny word.
01:54:34 He also called May's sister
01:54:36 when I hear it, when I see it.
01:54:38 He also called May's sister a
01:54:40 slatternly, which is an interesting...
01:54:42 You get the fucking
01:54:44 thesaurus out for this?
01:54:46 Yeah, yeah.
01:54:48 Radcon 5 soon.
01:54:50 It's just unrelated.
01:54:52 Yeah,
01:54:54 the address.
01:54:56 Uh...
01:55:00 This guy says,
01:55:02 why aren't they married?
01:55:04 So why is it not my wife absconded?
01:55:06 Amanda Ralph absconded.
01:55:08 Yeah, why does he say...
01:55:10 Oh, I guess he probably says Amanda Morris.
01:55:12 I mean, he probably says that because
01:55:14 in other tweets he says like, you know,
01:55:16 not my wife, she's just a whore.
01:55:18 Goddamn, that's probably why he's using
01:55:20 her maiden name.
01:55:22 Since you mentioned it, it's gotta be
01:55:24 that like, she just wanted to get married
01:55:26 for some sort of legal or financial reason
01:55:28 and then take the first opportunity
01:55:30 to abscond.
01:55:32 I'm using his word, but whatever.
01:55:34 It's gotta be that. It makes the most sense.
01:55:36 The timing is like...
01:55:38 The timing's perfect.
01:55:40 I guess I just don't know what
01:55:42 you can gain.
01:55:44 I think it's gotta be alimony.
01:55:46 It's gotta be alimony.
01:55:48 Yeah, I think so. I think probably being
01:55:50 legally married makes a better case.
01:55:52 How would you go about getting alimony?
01:55:54 Well, I don't exactly know.
01:55:56 You don't run away. You just get a divorce.
01:55:58 Right?
01:56:00 Well, she...
01:56:02 Yes, but I mean, she...
01:56:04 Okay, she probably wanted to run...
01:56:06 I mean, this is total speculation,
01:56:08 but what I'm thinking is maybe she had
01:56:10 wanted to run away for a while,
01:56:12 but was like, well, if I run away before
01:56:14 we get married, it'll be harder to get alimony.
01:56:16 So I just need to put up with it
01:56:18 until we get married.
01:56:20 And then once we're legally married,
01:56:22 I can abscond.
01:56:24 And then we can...
01:56:26 Because absconding is what I want.
01:56:28 Then I can do it.
01:56:30 And only then, once I've absconded,
01:56:32 we can start the legal
01:56:34 proceedings for divorce, I think.
01:56:40 I have a strong feeling that this was
01:56:42 not planned.
01:56:44 I mentioned it just because...
01:56:46 Like, how?
01:56:48 My version
01:56:50 makes more sense, but
01:56:52 maybe that's not
01:56:54 what I should be looking for
01:56:56 in this situation.
01:56:58 Maybe that's not the most
01:57:00 sensible way to try and interpret
01:57:02 these people's actions.
01:57:08 Well, now
01:57:10 let's actually talk about One Piece.
01:57:12 Let's actually talk about One Piece. I did actually read it
01:57:14 ahead of time. Same.
01:57:16 We've done it.
01:57:18 Yeah, at last.
01:57:20 I mean, I guess the big...
01:57:22 So, the One Piece corner...
01:57:24 One Piece corner begins
01:57:26 at whatever time stamp this is,
01:57:28 and will end at another time...
01:57:30 In the future.
01:57:32 Down in the description you can see
01:57:34 ahead of time, if you want,
01:57:36 to skip it.
01:57:38 Spoilers, all right, here we go.
01:57:40 So, chapter 1073
01:57:42 Miss Buckingham Stussy.
01:57:44 Is it just a coincidence
01:57:46 that you mentioned
01:57:48 Weevil? Like, you mentioned Weevil a couple
01:57:50 weeks ago, and I was like
01:57:52 who the heck is that?
01:57:54 I keep things like that
01:57:56 in my brain, just because it's like
01:57:58 there's so much going on in One Piece
01:58:00 and Weevil is like such a big
01:58:02 like, wow, what a thing
01:58:04 and then you don't hear about him for
01:58:06 arcs and arcs, months and months,
01:58:08 years and years, it's like, wow,
01:58:10 when is he gonna come back in? Because he has to.
01:58:12 Well, he's freaking back.
01:58:14 He's freaking back.
01:58:16 He's freaking back.
01:58:18 Let's talk about the cover page for us, though.
01:58:20 We got
01:58:22 the Mads scientists
01:58:24 and we got
01:58:26 Oh, wait a minute.
01:58:28 Mads scientists.
01:58:30 Oh my god.
01:58:32 Even though I didn't get that, as I said it.
01:58:34 Just as you said that, I'm like, wait a minute.
01:58:36 I think that's probably the joke.
01:58:38 Mads scientists.
01:58:40 So
01:58:42 last week
01:58:44 they were like, ha ha, look at all our
01:58:46 evil plans, evil inventions
01:58:48 and then Vegapunk comes
01:58:50 with a peaceful invention
01:58:52 that stops tanks from being able to shoot,
01:58:54 turns gunpowder into
01:58:56 flowers.
01:58:58 Aw, that's sweet. You know what, I didn't even think about it.
01:59:00 I kind of just kind of glossed over this one.
01:59:02 And he, I think,
01:59:04 his wing, I think he wins the prize.
01:59:06 Yeah,
01:59:08 Vegapunk receives the bell prize.
01:59:10 The Ibell Prize.
01:59:12 The Ibell Prize.
01:59:14 Instead of the Nobel?
01:59:16 I guess so, yeah.
01:59:18 For the GP, the gunpowder flower.
01:59:20 Aw.
01:59:22 What a precious man.
01:59:24 What a sweet precious man
01:59:26 who I hope will not
01:59:28 betray our heroes.
01:59:30 Yeah.
01:59:32 I guess this is like a hint that he's
01:59:34 you know, he's been a good guy generally.
01:59:36 This seems like he's a pretty good guy.
01:59:38 I mean, I guess he's friends with like
01:59:40 the giants of Elbaf and
01:59:42 freaking Porcus D. Sol.
01:59:44 Not Porcus D. Sol.
01:59:46 What was his name?
01:59:48 Sol D.
01:59:50 Oh, Jaguar D. Sol.
01:59:52 Jaguar D. Sol, yeah.
01:59:54 Um, so I mean,
01:59:56 I guess he's probably a good guy.
01:59:58 Okay, so.
02:00:00 He's friends with cool dudes.
02:00:02 Okay, so
02:00:04 Kaku got bit
02:00:06 by the clone of
02:00:08 Ms. Buckingham Stussy.
02:00:10 We have discovered she's a vampire.
02:00:12 Luchi stands no chance.
02:00:14 She gets him with a lipstick, a
02:00:16 Kyro Seiki seastone lipstick.
02:00:18 Bites him as well.
02:00:20 Oh, I get it.
02:00:22 She bit him
02:00:24 and her seastone lipstick.
02:00:26 Allowed her to bite him, to get through the hacky
02:00:28 and because it weakens
02:00:30 devil fruit users.
02:00:32 So.
02:00:36 I think that's the
02:00:38 implication. Okay, okay.
02:00:40 Well, I mean,
02:00:42 would she need
02:00:44 that just to bite him?
02:00:46 I think.
02:00:48 I thought it was that the seastone lipstick
02:00:50 is what like put him out.
02:00:52 Because she had
02:00:54 seastone on her lips
02:00:56 for the bite.
02:00:58 No, I think it's
02:01:00 pretty universally used as
02:01:02 like a way to stop
02:01:04 a devil fruit user
02:01:06 to hurt them more is to use
02:01:08 seastone.
02:01:10 Like some of the
02:01:12 guys, the Marines have like
02:01:14 seastone bullets very occasionally.
02:01:16 Yeah. And you can't,
02:01:18 Luchi can't touch those, they'll hurt him.
02:01:20 So he has to dodge them instead.
02:01:22 He can't like, he can't balloon
02:01:24 them away like regular bullets.
02:01:26 Yeah.
02:01:28 It hasn't been used that much.
02:01:30 I think it was used a little bit
02:01:32 in like
02:01:34 a whole cake
02:01:36 vaguely remember that.
02:01:38 So is the
02:01:40 so she's clearly, she's clearly
02:01:42 not a devil fruit user then
02:01:44 because she can wear
02:01:46 seastone lipstick.
02:01:48 No, she doesn't
02:01:50 wear it. She picks it up and
02:01:52 steps into his neck
02:01:54 to, you know, so she's not
02:01:56 touching it. He's touching it. And then she can
02:01:58 use him in his weakened state.
02:02:00 She can bite into his skin
02:02:02 and do, do stuff.
02:02:04 Get him. I don't know what
02:02:06 her bite does, but seems to knock them
02:02:08 out at least.
02:02:10 Well, hang on.
02:02:12 She
02:02:16 I mean, she says
02:02:18 seastone. Oh, wait.
02:02:20 She pops the lipstick.
02:02:22 She says, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, she like puts
02:02:24 it. She like puts it on his neck.
02:02:26 I see. I see. I see. Yes.
02:02:28 Does
02:02:30 seastone negate hockey too?
02:02:32 I don't think it negates hockey.
02:02:34 I think it just makes devil fruit
02:02:36 users weaker.
02:02:38 So it's more difficult to do
02:02:40 anything. Yeah.
02:02:42 Like you can't like physically
02:02:44 overpower the effects of it.
02:02:46 If you fall in the water, you sink. It doesn't matter
02:02:48 how strong you are. If you're a devil fruit user,
02:02:50 the power of the sea makes you
02:02:52 completely immobile.
02:02:54 Yes, the power
02:02:56 of the primordial
02:02:58 nature that is the sea
02:03:00 that wants to hold
02:03:02 devil fruit users
02:03:04 down from
02:03:06 achieving
02:03:08 the dreams of
02:03:10 Yeah, I forgot about all that.
02:03:12 That shit.
02:03:14 That confusing shit.
02:03:16 Yeah.
02:03:18 The sea, it doesn't want you to reach
02:03:20 the sea hates fruit. The sky of dreams.
02:03:22 The fruit is all about
02:03:24 what if humans wanted to fly?
02:03:26 They unlock the human's
02:03:28 potential to
02:03:30 do whatever they want. To become rubber and
02:03:32 things. The sea hates fruit
02:03:34 and the fruit is dreams
02:03:36 and man eats fruit
02:03:38 and go up.
02:03:40 And sea do not like
02:03:42 man go up.
02:03:44 And that's why the sea is at the bottom of the land.
02:03:46 Sorry, sea does not like
02:03:48 zizi. Sea does not like zizi
02:03:50 go up.
02:03:56 Okay, so we understand.
02:03:58 We understand where the sea is coming from.
02:04:00 Yes, so Stussy
02:04:02 takes him out.
02:04:04 And it's not just, I don't know why I didn't think
02:04:06 of this. I guess it was just sort of
02:04:08 out of left field.
02:04:10 But she was the lady on the phone
02:04:12 that Vigapunk called earlier.
02:04:14 Oh, sure.
02:04:16 Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
02:04:18 So she's the
02:04:20 secret person on the island
02:04:22 that could help them.
02:04:24 Which is
02:04:26 quite a coincidence.
02:04:28 Pretty good.
02:04:30 I guess it's not a coincidence, but it's just
02:04:32 sort of like, she is
02:04:34 working for like how many years?
02:04:38 Yeah, I mean.
02:04:40 As like a person undercover
02:04:42 for all these things.
02:04:44 And she's a clone loyal to Vigapunk.
02:04:46 Just like the Seraphim.
02:04:48 Yeah?
02:04:50 I guess so.
02:04:52 But the Seraphim are different, more stronger.
02:04:56 The Seraphim are different, more stronger.
02:04:58 Zoro says he sees
02:05:00 humanity in little baby
02:05:02 Mihawk.
02:05:04 So like,
02:05:06 he seems to think the Seraphim
02:05:08 are not like, they're not like automatons.
02:05:10 Yeah.
02:05:12 Potentially maybe
02:05:14 try to break their programming if they wanted to.
02:05:16 Yeah, this is just like Mega Man.
02:05:18 I would say it is very
02:05:20 yes.
02:05:22 Oh my god, just like Mega Man
02:05:24 collecting the robot master's powers.
02:05:26 A closer inspection, you're not the same.
02:05:28 You actually have a spark of humanity still.
02:05:30 I don't know whether that means
02:05:32 Mihawk has no
02:05:34 humanity.
02:05:36 But I guess, well actually, no.
02:05:38 I think he's saying, you're not the same.
02:05:40 Like the Seraphim are not the same
02:05:42 guy.
02:05:44 They're not the same soul.
02:05:46 They have individuality still.
02:05:48 Yeah, I think he's saying like you're not just
02:05:50 a robot taking commands.
02:05:52 Yeah.
02:05:54 What the hell are you?
02:05:56 So the Seraphim nearly kill everyone.
02:05:58 But it's okay.
02:06:00 Because they managed to get a
02:06:02 little command out and then
02:06:04 they take
02:06:06 the command and then they're here.
02:06:08 No standing still.
02:06:10 Well, Stussy says
02:06:12 Stussy commands them
02:06:14 to stop.
02:06:16 No, it's
02:06:18 the little guy.
02:06:20 Edison. He manages to say it.
02:06:22 They think he exploded, but then Stussy
02:06:24 saved him at the last second.
02:06:26 Yes, okay.
02:06:28 I see.
02:06:30 So
02:06:32 because Vegapunks orders
02:06:34 Super Seed,
02:06:36 B-Zeroes.
02:06:38 Yeah.
02:06:40 Because Stussy couldn't
02:06:42 Stussy has the same
02:06:44 clearance as Luchy
02:06:46 which means that she could not override
02:06:48 Luchy's commands.
02:06:52 Yeah, wait.
02:06:54 That's what they say, but like if they're the same
02:06:56 why wouldn't
02:06:58 why couldn't one
02:07:00 cancel the other?
02:07:02 My authority level is the same so I can't
02:07:04 cancel it.
02:07:06 That's odd.
02:07:08 I guess
02:07:10 there must be a rule there that like
02:07:12 if a person
02:07:14 from a certain
02:07:16 level of authority
02:07:18 says something
02:07:20 that another person of the same level
02:07:22 can't confuse them
02:07:24 by saying something else
02:07:26 and that's the idea.
02:07:28 It has to be a person higher up the chain
02:07:30 to say something. It has to be the person higher
02:07:32 in the chain and also
02:07:34 the first person on that level of the chain
02:07:36 gets to set the commands and then no one else
02:07:38 on that same command level gets to Super Seed them.
02:07:40 Yeah, I guess that's
02:07:42 it's an odd way to work.
02:07:44 I guess it just means
02:07:46 whatever.
02:07:48 It gives an excuse for a
02:07:50 thrilling moment where Edison nearly got blowed up.
02:07:54 It's true.
02:07:56 And I would have
02:07:58 been so devastated
02:08:00 if he got blowed up.
02:08:02 So the stakes truly were raised
02:08:04 in that moment.
02:08:06 And then
02:08:08 their docile
02:08:10 and then it turns out
02:08:12 Vegapunk's main body
02:08:14 has vanished
02:08:16 and they can't find Bonnie either.
02:08:18 Bonnie obviously has just found
02:08:20 the memory of Kuma.
02:08:22 Oh, right.
02:08:24 We don't know whether she touched it.
02:08:26 She looked like she was going to
02:08:28 and
02:08:30 I guess we don't know
02:08:32 at the moment what's going on
02:08:34 with them.
02:08:36 No updates on that.
02:08:38 Because it says vanished as in like they're gone
02:08:40 but it could just mean they can't find them
02:08:42 but I feel like
02:08:44 vanished implies that they've actually gone somewhere somehow.
02:08:46 My translation that I read
02:08:48 says however an event will occur
02:08:50 the disappearance of Dr.
02:08:52 Vegapunk which
02:08:54 merely implies that they cannot
02:08:56 find him to me.
02:08:58 Right.
02:09:02 I got another thing to say
02:09:04 but I'll wait until the end of the chapter.
02:09:06 So then we switch over
02:09:08 to Sphinx New World
02:09:10 White Beards hometown
02:09:12 where Marco lives.
02:09:14 Does he live there?
02:09:16 Yeah, he lived there.
02:09:18 He's a doctor there
02:09:20 and everyone knows in there I assume he lives there
02:09:22 because after the White Beard Pirates broke up
02:09:24 he settled down there
02:09:26 which is where he's been seen
02:09:28 since White Beard's death
02:09:30 so I assume so but
02:09:34 I think in the interim
02:09:36 where Marco had left to go to Wano
02:09:38 Yeah, he was out doing like
02:09:40 missions and like giving people messages
02:09:42 and stuff.
02:09:44 Yeah, he was out flying around
02:09:46 and then the Marines came
02:09:48 those nasty stinky Marines
02:09:50 with a rat face.
02:09:52 He's like catfish man.
02:09:54 Oh yeah.
02:09:56 He looks like a fishman.
02:09:58 Yeah, yeah.
02:10:02 They're gonna shoot some kids.
02:10:04 This is like old school Marines
02:10:06 from like Arlong Park.
02:10:08 It is.
02:10:10 The old school like we're evil and nasty
02:10:12 and we'll just fuck with innocent bystanders.
02:10:14 A child?
02:10:16 How dare you?
02:10:18 What if we shoot you one by one?
02:10:20 Wouldn't that make you cry?
02:10:24 And then fucking Balaam
02:10:26 Edward Weevil comes in
02:10:28 with the White Beard
02:10:30 weapon.
02:10:32 I don't know if it's the same one.
02:10:34 Oh yeah, he's got the big glaive thing.
02:10:36 Yeah, true.
02:10:38 I forget if he already had one
02:10:40 like that.
02:10:42 Well they, I thought they left
02:10:44 White Beards like on his grave.
02:10:46 Yeah, I don't think he would.
02:10:48 He could have retrieved it.
02:10:50 He could have retrieved it.
02:10:52 I feel like it maybe would have been mentioned.
02:10:54 But he could have already
02:10:56 had a glaive similar.
02:10:58 Yeah.
02:11:00 Cause I can't remember the last time we saw him
02:11:02 what he looked like.
02:11:04 But yeah, he's a strong guy.
02:11:06 He makes all the Marines run away
02:11:08 and he's protecting his father's
02:11:10 hometown.
02:11:12 So he believes that he's the son of White Beard.
02:11:14 We still don't know actually
02:11:16 but it's not really corroborated
02:11:18 by most of other people.
02:11:20 Most other people just believe that it's a lie
02:11:22 perpetrated by
02:11:24 the lady that he's always with
02:11:26 to get White Beard's money as a scam.
02:11:28 It could be true.
02:11:30 It could be true.
02:11:32 Maybe it's true.
02:11:34 It would be cool if it's true because
02:11:36 God this,
02:11:38 the lady is
02:11:40 Miss Buckingham Stussy.
02:11:42 She is a scientist.
02:11:44 So this is the same lady
02:11:46 who is the clone.
02:11:48 Her clone is betraying
02:11:50 CP0
02:11:52 on Egghead right now.
02:11:54 Her original form
02:11:56 is, yeah, the mom of
02:11:58 Weevil.
02:12:00 Former member of the Rocks Pirates
02:12:02 which leads a lot of credence
02:12:04 to the idea that she could have
02:12:06 sired a child
02:12:08 of White Beards because
02:12:10 he was also on the crew.
02:12:12 Definitely. No doubt.
02:12:14 She's also
02:12:16 old though. I guess Weevil would be old too.
02:12:20 You mean White Beard?
02:12:22 No, Weevil. I don't know how old Weevil is.
02:12:24 He's such a
02:12:26 beast looking guy. You don't really know how
02:12:28 he can really tell.
02:12:30 He could be 18 or he could be
02:12:32 like 30.
02:12:34 It's hard to tell.
02:12:36 But yeah, she's not only a scientist,
02:12:38 part of the Rocks Pirates.
02:12:40 So all of this stuff with the mad scientists
02:12:42 and
02:12:44 Is she in any of the
02:12:45 Rocks Pirates?
02:12:46 Art? Like the intro?
02:12:48 I don't think we've seen her.
02:12:50 I don't think we've seen her in those.
02:12:52 Yeah.
02:12:54 It's those same three
02:12:56 Jerma and
02:12:58 Caesar and
02:13:00 that guy who may or may not be
02:13:02 the artist potentially known as Queen.
02:13:04 The artist potentially known as Queen.
02:13:06 Yeah.
02:13:09 And yeah, she would be there.
02:13:12 I guess they didn't want to spoil
02:13:14 surprise for this moment.
02:13:16 Because if they showed
02:13:18 what Stussy
02:13:20 looked like, it would be obvious
02:13:22 that Stussy is the Stussy that is
02:13:24 currently in the comic.
02:13:26 You think?
02:13:28 You think it would be obvious?
02:13:30 Well, if it's, I mean,
02:13:32 it might not be obvious, but like the idea
02:13:34 is it's characters we haven't
02:13:36 seen young before looking young,
02:13:38 but Stussy as a clone is
02:13:40 young. And so she
02:13:42 would like, theoretically,
02:13:44 she would look the same in
02:13:46 those flashback. Oh, yeah,
02:13:48 yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.
02:13:50 Honestly, that would make me
02:13:52 honestly, that would have made me be like,
02:13:54 why does she look the same?
02:13:56 What the fuck? What the fuck?
02:13:58 But isn't it been a while?
02:14:00 Vega punks old. Vega punks.
02:14:02 And now we see she is old.
02:14:04 She looks great
02:14:06 as well. I love her
02:14:08 like, her gnarly
02:14:10 old hands with all the rings on them.
02:14:12 Hmm.
02:14:14 I
02:14:16 I
02:14:18 I was
02:14:20 shocked and horrified by this revelation.
02:14:22 Seems
02:14:24 seems like he probably
02:14:26 seems like he probably is
02:14:28 Whitebeard's son, honestly.
02:14:30 If she was a rocks pirate
02:14:32 and all that, just seems
02:14:34 perfectly reasonable.
02:14:36 Okay, so
02:14:38 besides, you think she knows she has a clone?
02:14:40 Who knows? That's the thing.
02:14:42 Yeah, I don't know.
02:14:44 Besides the fact that we
02:14:46 is a revelation of this character,
02:14:48 we've only seen like a couple times before
02:14:50 is very relevant to the effect of the
02:14:52 events happening right now is
02:14:54 that we've all protected
02:14:56 those kids, protected the town,
02:14:58 but then they sent Admiral
02:15:00 Rokyugu
02:15:02 the new Admiral
02:15:04 who I think has been revealed.
02:15:06 I can't remember what he looks like. Let me just
02:15:12 I think he
02:15:14 arrived at the end of Wano
02:15:16 and he tried to bully
02:15:18 Momonosuke and the guys
02:15:20 and he was like, what was he?
02:15:22 Like a vine guy?
02:15:24 Wait, Weevil did? No.
02:15:26 Rokyugu, the new Admiral.
02:15:28 Rok-
02:15:30 Fuck.
02:15:32 There's a new Admiral?
02:15:34 Yeah, because
02:15:36 Aokiji left and then Akainu
02:15:38 got promoted to the
02:15:40 Fleet Admiral. So there's three.
02:15:42 One of them is Kizaru.
02:15:44 There's Kizaru and there's
02:15:46 the purple monkey guy.
02:15:48 Purple man from Dressros and then there's this guy
02:15:50 who was only revealed
02:15:52 at the very end of Wano after
02:15:54 everyone had been defeated.
02:15:56 Yeah, I
02:15:58 totally forgot about this guy.
02:16:00 Yeah, so that's the reveal of that guy.
02:16:02 That guy apparently
02:16:04 took Weevil away
02:16:06 which means that
02:16:08 Oh, um, um
02:16:10 he got like arrested
02:16:12 after the restrication with the
02:16:14 with the Marines. Yeah, so they sent
02:16:16 Admiral Rokyugu. He took
02:16:18 Weevil away
02:16:20 which means because right now
02:16:22 does it say that in this chapter?
02:16:24 She says it.
02:16:26 Stussy, old lady
02:16:28 says that Rokyugu came
02:16:30 as backup and they stole Weevil away.
02:16:32 Oh, Navy Admiral Greenbull came here.
02:16:34 Okay. Greenbull, that's the other name for him.
02:16:36 Right. Yeah.
02:16:38 We're reading different scans.
02:16:40 Yeah.
02:16:42 So Weevil is with, presumably
02:16:44 with him or
02:16:46 it's, he could have been taking
02:16:48 to Impel down but I think
02:16:50 the implication here is that
02:16:52 because the admirals have been called
02:16:54 with all of these warships to
02:16:56 Egghead is that Greenbull
02:16:58 along with Weevil
02:17:00 are on their
02:17:02 way with all of the other warships
02:17:04 and Kizaru and
02:17:06 Purple Man. So it's, I
02:17:08 thought it was just, is it not just
02:17:10 Kizaru who's going there?
02:17:12 Like I know Kizaru is going there.
02:17:14 I thought he was the only one.
02:17:16 You know, I can't remember if this
02:17:18 maybe they didn't say all the admirals would be there.
02:17:21 I feel like it's such a big thing
02:17:23 because we see
02:17:25 it could just be Kizaru actually
02:17:27 like he's the one heading it.
02:17:29 Yeah. But the fact is that
02:17:31 we scroll down a bit
02:17:33 one of the five elders is on one of the
02:17:35 special boats.
02:17:37 Is he going there also?
02:17:39 Oh wait, he's talking to Kizaru so.
02:17:41 Yeah, Kizaru is there. Yeah.
02:17:43 And there's one of the five elders
02:17:45 of Marishua
02:17:47 making a move for the first time.
02:17:49 I mean, if I can Jerry, Jerry,
02:17:51 J Garcia, Saint J Garcia
02:17:53 Saturn.
02:17:55 Yeah. What's the make of that name?
02:17:58 I think it's a reference
02:18:00 to like a. Is it Jerry, is it Jerry
02:18:02 Garcia?
02:18:05 Jerry Garcia.
02:18:07 Let me look up what he looks like.
02:18:09 There's a chapter nose thing in the scan.
02:18:12 Saturn's name might refer
02:18:14 to two unrelated musicians, Jerry Garcia.
02:18:17 There's also a Russell Garcia
02:18:19 who wrote a song called The Lost Souls of
02:18:21 Saturn.
02:18:23 Okay. So it could be.
02:18:25 This is this is what Jerry Garcia looks
02:18:27 like. And I mean, it looks
02:18:29 looks like a match to me.
02:18:31 Yeah. So.
02:18:33 J Garcia said it could be a combination.
02:18:35 But anyway, the
02:18:37 thing I wanted to mention earlier,
02:18:39 the seraphim.
02:18:41 The whole thing with like, oh, they listen
02:18:43 to the five elders above
02:18:46 and it just so happens
02:18:48 that a five elder is coming at
02:18:50 probably explicitly because of this
02:18:52 thing. They need him
02:18:54 so that he can control the seraphim,
02:18:56 which are the most powerful guys.
02:18:58 Because.
02:19:00 They said
02:19:02 that even if they hear
02:19:04 the voice of a
02:19:06 of a five elder gore say over
02:19:08 this transponder snail,
02:19:10 they won't count. It doesn't count.
02:19:12 But does it not count
02:19:15 because it's over a transponder
02:19:17 snail? I thought they were saying that it doesn't
02:19:19 count because
02:19:21 in the case of the seraphim
02:19:23 specifically, the order
02:19:25 of the order is different
02:19:27 and Vega punk outranks
02:19:29 the five elders in
02:19:31 in ordering them specifically.
02:19:33 But they did mention the transponder snail.
02:19:35 So maybe it is just that he has to be there
02:19:37 in person. I think that
02:19:39 the idea is
02:19:41 above Vega punk is
02:19:43 the five elders. But when
02:19:45 we when I've read that the first time is like, yeah,
02:19:47 but when are they going to be in marriage? Why?
02:19:49 Yeah, when are they going to see a five
02:19:51 elder? Well, now he's coming
02:19:53 and I think he's coming because
02:19:55 they know that that's how they work.
02:19:57 I think that is almost
02:19:59 definitely true.
02:20:01 I had thought what they
02:20:03 said. I had thought they had
02:20:05 explained it as like, yeah,
02:20:07 normally a gore say would
02:20:09 Trump them in
02:20:11 the order of ordering them.
02:20:13 But like, actually, they don't for some
02:20:15 reason in this specific case.
02:20:17 But the fact that he's here
02:20:19 means like
02:20:21 this has to be relevance.
02:20:23 It probably does. They're making so much
02:20:25 of this fucking order of like
02:20:27 who commands the seraphim.
02:20:29 Yeah. And I think it's not just
02:20:31 like you can't
02:20:33 order them through
02:20:35 like electronic communication
02:20:37 regardless of who you are.
02:20:39 You have to be in front of them.
02:20:41 They have to hear and see it from you.
02:20:43 I think that
02:20:45 makes sense and
02:20:47 okay.
02:20:49 So this will be interesting because
02:20:51 it's it's it's yeah.
02:20:53 It'll be interesting
02:20:55 on a couple of ways because
02:20:57 we just saw that Edison
02:20:59 almost got blown up
02:21:01 because they're so powerful, so quick.
02:21:03 It's hard to get a word in
02:21:05 if they're trying to kill you to
02:21:07 tell them to stop even though you have the
02:21:09 authority. They don't recognize the authority.
02:21:11 They just recognize the order.
02:21:13 So is this guy is one of the five
02:21:15 elders? Are we going to see them fight?
02:21:17 Is he going to be really quick?
02:21:19 Is he going to be super strong?
02:21:21 Or is he just going to be an old man?
02:21:23 How's he going to do it?
02:21:25 Yeah.
02:21:27 Dude, that'll be fucked up
02:21:29 to see like a Gora say like
02:21:31 in a battle.
02:21:33 Even it just for half a second so he can
02:21:35 get his
02:21:37 his order out.
02:21:39 I feel like
02:21:41 because of there being so many warships
02:21:43 the marines
02:21:45 are going to
02:21:47 hold them off so that he can say his
02:21:49 thing and he's not going to lift a finger
02:21:51 which is going to be characteristic of that
02:21:53 sort of a character.
02:21:55 That's what I would think.
02:21:57 Yeah.
02:21:59 You never know. He could have a devil fruit.
02:22:01 Got that.
02:22:03 I feel like
02:22:05 that
02:22:07 I don't want everyone to have a devil fruit.
02:22:09 Yeah.
02:22:11 I like the idea of the Gora say just being some guys
02:22:13 who are in control.
02:22:15 They're just guys who have a lot of political power
02:22:17 and they just tell other people
02:22:19 by their word
02:22:21 they cause wars to happen
02:22:23 and stuff.
02:22:25 So they got all these warships
02:22:27 coming.
02:22:29 Vegapunk
02:22:31 has never been nullified
02:22:33 for now.
02:22:35 The seraphim are on the side
02:22:37 of the straw hats
02:22:39 presumably going to get on the boat
02:22:41 with the rest of the Vegapunks
02:22:43 and Stussy
02:22:45 and leave
02:22:47 but we can't find the actual Vegapunk
02:22:49 and I think that's going to be the thing
02:22:51 that holds them up long enough for the warships to get here
02:22:55 and then there's going to be a whole fucking thing.
02:22:57 Yeah.
02:22:59 Because it seems like
02:23:01 they have the seraphim
02:23:03 CP-Zero taken out
02:23:05 they can just go.
02:23:07 But then Vegapunk is nowhere to be found.
02:23:09 Are they lost?
02:23:11 Are they teleported somewhere?
02:23:13 Where were they trying to go with Vegapunk?
02:23:17 Where are they trying to go?
02:23:19 What do you mean?
02:23:21 They were going to the ship
02:23:23 and they were going to leave Egghead
02:23:25 with Vegapunk
02:23:27 Where are they trying to go?
02:23:29 They're just trying to get out of there.
02:23:31 They're just trying to get out of there.
02:23:33 Vegapunk is like
02:23:35 I've discovered something about the voids entry
02:23:37 or something and it's like bad information
02:23:39 the government doesn't want me to know
02:23:41 I gotta get out of here
02:23:43 and it just so happens that the straw hats arrive
02:23:45 at the perfect time to help him escape.
02:23:49 So there's no goal other than
02:23:51 get the fuck out.
02:23:53 Sensible.
02:23:55 I really hope they use a coup de burst
02:23:57 to fly over the warships.
02:23:59 Oh, yes.
02:24:01 I haven't seen that in a while.
02:24:03 The classic coup de burst.
02:24:09 You know, I gotta admit
02:24:13 it helps me a lot
02:24:15 to understand what's going on
02:24:17 to have these discussions
02:24:19 because
02:24:21 kind of all I really took away from reading the chapter
02:24:23 was like
02:24:25 Oh, yeah, Weevil's still here
02:24:27 and the Gorace is around
02:24:29 interesting and
02:24:31 Oh, Weevil's mom is
02:24:33 the clone lady.
02:24:35 Yeah.
02:24:37 I kind of didn't really think about what this means
02:24:39 for the state of the battle
02:24:41 but actually, yeah,
02:24:43 there are pretty big implications
02:24:45 for how this is going to go down.
02:24:47 I don't want to let it leave my head
02:24:49 that there's
02:24:51 a rescue operation with Garp
02:24:53 trying to get Kobe from Blackbeard
02:24:57 and Weevil has been taking
02:24:59 by Red Bull, a green bull
02:25:01 not Red Bull.
02:25:03 From
02:25:05 Rokyoyoyo, don't know how to say his name.
02:25:07 Yeah.
02:25:09 And if there's all these warships
02:25:11 potentially other admirals
02:25:13 because if they asked for Garp
02:25:15 to be at this thing and he says, no, I'm going to help Kobe instead
02:25:17 like they needed Garp
02:25:19 they might need the other admirals.
02:25:23 I don't think Aikainu is there.
02:25:25 I think it's not that you know it like HQ.
02:25:27 He's like, he's at HQ.
02:25:29 He was getting like phone calls and stuff.
02:25:31 Yeah, and I mean...
02:25:33 Fuji Tora is...
02:25:35 Do you remember where
02:25:37 Fuji Tora was?
02:25:39 I don't think we've seen Fuji Tora
02:25:41 since Dress Rosa.
02:25:43 I believe he's just not
02:25:45 been around.
02:25:47 Yeah.
02:25:49 Yeah, I mean they would need
02:25:51 two new ones because
02:25:53 Aokiji left
02:25:55 and Aikainu
02:25:57 was promoted.
02:25:59 Yeah.
02:26:01 And Sengoku retired or whatever.
02:26:03 Yeah.
02:26:05 Sengoku retired.
02:26:07 Aikainu became the new...
02:26:09 Is it called Fleet Admiral?
02:26:11 Fleet Admiral, yeah.
02:26:13 The highest position of the Marines.
02:26:15 Green Bull and...
02:26:17 I think it's Green Bull and Purple Monkey.
02:26:19 Or
02:26:21 Purple...
02:26:22 Dragon?
02:26:23 I don't think it's Dragon.
02:26:25 Or is Kizaru Yellow Monkey?
02:26:27 I forget the names like that.
02:26:31 Let's have a little
02:26:33 Google.
02:26:35 Fuji Tora is Purple Something.
02:26:37 And Aokiji is
02:26:39 Blue... I think Aokiji is probably
02:26:41 Blue Dragon?
02:26:43 No.
02:26:45 No.
02:26:47 Isho, better known by his alias
02:26:49 Fuji Tora is an admiral
02:26:51 in the Marines.
02:26:53 Where is Purple?
02:26:55 He's got to be the Purple Man.
02:26:57 Does he wear Purple? I mean I haven't seen him
02:26:59 drawn. Yeah, he wears Purple.
02:27:01 Well, the manga
02:27:03 is in black and white.
02:27:05 I watched a bit of Dress Rosa anime.
02:27:07 I tried to watch the anime.
02:27:09 I think it was just a little
02:27:11 slow going just generally.
02:27:13 Kizaru is Yellow Monkey.
02:27:15 Fuji Tora is
02:27:17 Wisteria Tiger, but Wisteria
02:27:19 is like a purple flower.
02:27:21 Oh, Fuji Tora
02:27:23 literally meaning Wisteria Tiger
02:27:25 is in Japanese.
02:27:27 Okay.
02:27:29 Aokiji was Blue Pheasant
02:27:31 and Ayaka was Red Dog.
02:27:33 Okay.
02:27:35 Nice color-coded
02:27:37 villains.
02:27:39 Um...
02:27:41 Hell, yeah.
02:27:45 They're all big.
02:27:47 I found
02:27:49 doing the pod de-cast
02:27:51 was quite fun to like
02:27:53 wrap my head around some of the
02:27:55 longer...
02:27:57 Like, some of the things that just
02:27:59 sort of leave your mind when they're not
02:28:01 happening in front of you and then they come back
02:28:03 and it's like, whoa!
02:28:05 It's like, what the fuck?
02:28:07 It was good to have the discussion
02:28:09 so I could like wrap my head around stuff
02:28:11 that was happening week to week.
02:28:13 Honestly,
02:28:15 when I just read it
02:28:17 there's like so much
02:28:19 it kind of just
02:28:21 leaves my head and I kind of just
02:28:23 don't even bother to try.
02:28:25 I kind of just don't even bother trying to keep it all in
02:28:27 because like I know I can't do it.
02:28:29 I
02:28:31 I pride myself on remembering some stuff.
02:28:33 It's fun.
02:28:35 I like complicated, extremely...
02:28:37 extremely complicated stories.
02:28:39 I really like the parts of the caribbean
02:28:41 when in like two and three
02:28:43 when they just kept getting weirder and stranger.
02:28:45 I was like, fuck yeah.
02:28:47 I understand. Nobody else did.
02:28:49 They were all like,
02:28:51 what? Huh?
02:28:53 Where's the crabs come from?
02:28:59 I don't think I saw that one.
02:29:01 Don't think I saw
02:29:03 past like the second one.
02:29:05 No, the third one carries
02:29:07 on from the second one.
02:29:09 It's like the continuation of that
02:29:11 Davy Jones story.
02:29:13 I definitely saw
02:29:15 the second one with Davy Jones.
02:29:17 Yeah, and the third one is
02:29:19 Davy Jones part two.
02:29:21 You gotta watch it.
02:29:25 That's great.
02:29:27 I love it. It's pirates.
02:29:29 I love pirates so much.
02:29:31 Pirates are good,
02:29:33 I guess.
02:29:35 I guess.
02:29:39 One last thing we didn't mention.
02:29:41 Stussy, old.
02:29:43 I don't know how to talk about Stussy.
02:29:45 Yes, true.
02:29:47 Old Stussy says
02:29:49 that Vegapunk will know how to prove
02:29:51 that Weevil is
02:29:53 Whitebeard's son.
02:29:55 I guess
02:29:57 that means
02:29:59 the technology, DNA technology
02:30:01 is not widely known and used.
02:30:05 Interesting, let me
02:30:07 see here.
02:30:09 But it could mean something more deep than that
02:30:11 because we see Weevil has a lot of scars on him.
02:30:13 Is he a construct?
02:30:15 Is he like a freak made of the DNA
02:30:17 of Whitebeard?
02:30:19 Yeah, I mean.
02:30:21 Is he like a clone
02:30:23 of Whitebeard just like Stussy was a clone?
02:30:25 She could mean that
02:30:27 he can do a paternity test
02:30:29 or
02:30:31 she could mean
02:30:33 that he knows something about
02:30:35 Weevil's history
02:30:37 that he can vouch for it.
02:30:39 I think the fact that
02:30:41 Stussy is already
02:30:43 one of the rocks pirates cloned
02:30:45 perfectly
02:30:47 could mean that another rocks pirate
02:30:49 was unsuccessfully cloned
02:30:51 and they made a freak Frankenstein's Weevil.
02:30:53 Oh.
02:30:55 Does he have
02:30:57 Weevil?
02:30:59 I mean,
02:31:01 I don't know if there's scars.
02:31:03 Could he be like a patchwork
02:31:05 man?
02:31:07 Like they put pieces of him together
02:31:09 out of pieces of Whitebeard
02:31:11 or something?
02:31:13 He could be.
02:31:15 I think it wouldn't be as simple as
02:31:17 just like an inheritance dispute.
02:31:19 I think the fact that Stussy is like a scientist
02:31:21 and Vegapunk knows the secret
02:31:23 could lead to some sort of clone
02:31:25 attempt
02:31:27 that didn't really work.
02:31:29 You know
02:31:31 that's
02:31:33 you're almost certainly
02:31:35 right.
02:31:37 This is
02:31:39 weird paternity
02:31:41 shit going on there.
02:31:43 Cloning is involved.
02:31:45 What else can I say?
02:31:47 Cloning is almost certainly involved.
02:31:49 I'm
02:31:51 sort of like
02:31:53 because the Gorose is coming
02:31:55 at least this guy
02:31:57 and his ability to take over the Seraphim
02:31:59 I feel like
02:32:01 it's likely that
02:32:03 the Straw Hats might escape
02:32:05 but not with the Seraphim
02:32:07 and the Seraphim will put up a fight
02:32:09 because he's there somehow
02:32:11 gets in contact with them.
02:32:13 The Marines take over Egghead
02:32:15 and Vegapunk
02:32:17 and his Vegapunkettes
02:32:19 and hopefully some of them will die
02:32:21 but
02:32:23 some of them will live
02:32:25 and they'll run away
02:32:29 but I think the Seraphim
02:32:31 they're not going to be helping the Straw Hats
02:32:33 on the ship. I feel like
02:32:35 they're staying here somehow.
02:32:37 Zora says
02:32:39 he sees humanity
02:32:41 so I mean
02:32:43 is it just going to be like
02:32:45 at some point
02:32:47 they have to
02:32:49 follow the Gorose's orders
02:32:51 but maybe at some point they'll be like
02:32:53 I don't like this
02:32:55 actually.
02:32:57 I'm going to be a good guy.
02:32:59 Maybe they'll be taken to Majora's
02:33:01 like super bodyguards
02:33:03 and then
02:33:05 the special secret
02:33:07 that something really inspirational
02:33:09 will happen. Luffy will be so
02:33:11 bathed and then they'll hear about it
02:33:13 on the Denden Mushi on the radio
02:33:15 and they'll be like you know what
02:33:17 fuck the Goros saying and they kill them all
02:33:19 they kill them all right there
02:33:21 they got guys on the inside
02:33:23 that's
02:33:25 it would be really funny if
02:33:27 that's just how they did
02:33:29 literally
02:33:31 Luffy does something cool on the radio
02:33:33 and they're all just like oh that's neat
02:33:35 maybe
02:33:37 slavery is bad and then they just kill
02:33:39 the five presidents
02:33:41 okay
02:33:43 revolution
02:33:45 I
02:33:47 love one piece
02:33:49 it's good I can't believe a comic
02:33:51 is good
02:33:53 and then there's the fucking
02:33:55 the fucking laser beam from space
02:33:57 that killed potentially
02:33:59 killed
02:34:01 are they going to use
02:34:03 that laser beam on an egg head
02:34:05 wait did they
02:34:07 what did they blow up with that again
02:34:09 which island it was just an island
02:34:11 Sabo was seen like hiding
02:34:13 and after he escaped Marishwa
02:34:15 because he like it was
02:34:17 like oh he killed King
02:34:19 Cobra from alabaster
02:34:21 that was the story anyway
02:34:23 we don't know what happened but that's
02:34:25 it's that's what's the story and then he
02:34:27 was ran away he was in hiding and then
02:34:29 they like from space
02:34:31 or from the sky blasted it
02:34:33 with a giant laser if they have
02:34:35 a giant space laser
02:34:37 what do they need the what do they need
02:34:39 buster calls for
02:34:41 because this
02:34:43 takes a while to level up power
02:34:45 up this the laser
02:34:47 maybe it's maybe it's like
02:34:49 it's hard to hide the existence
02:34:51 of a giant laser so they
02:34:53 don't want to do it
02:34:55 all the time because if people like
02:34:57 that island used to exist and then it suddenly doesn't
02:34:59 that's a bit weird you know
02:35:01 the giant speak no I kind
02:35:03 of forgot about the giant space laser
02:35:05 but that definitely happened and probably
02:35:07 it deserves
02:35:09 some consideration
02:35:11 probably there will be
02:35:13 consequences to that
02:35:15 it's sort of interesting though because it's like
02:35:17 it implies that Sabo learned
02:35:19 information that is even more dangerous
02:35:21 than what Vega punk has figured out
02:35:25 because they're not using that here
02:35:27 they could have
02:35:29 probably yeah you know
02:35:31 like what the hell did Sabo learn
02:35:33 but I mean maybe
02:35:35 maybe it's not a space
02:35:37 laser maybe it's like somebody's fruit power
02:35:39 and they have to be there to do it
02:35:41 I well I think
02:35:43 it's more likely that it's one of the
02:35:45 ancient weapons that I mean
02:35:47 the world government has control of
02:35:49 yeah like the idea
02:35:51 of these ancient weapons existing
02:35:53 and like a bunch
02:35:55 of history that's been erased probably
02:35:57 speaks to me like
02:35:59 the ancient weapons were used in the person
02:36:01 it was devastating and the PR
02:36:03 would be terrible if people knew about it
02:36:05 the PR would be
02:36:07 I mean it would yeah
02:36:09 um
02:36:11 yeah but then
02:36:13 I guess it would
02:36:15 beg the question of why they're not
02:36:17 using it
02:36:19 here and I guess
02:36:21 either
02:36:23 like there's something there's stuff here
02:36:25 that they don't want to destroy
02:36:27 along with Vega punk
02:36:29 I guess so he does have a big brain
02:36:31 computer
02:36:33 yeah they might they might want to
02:36:35 secure that
02:36:37 that's so fucking weird the more I think about it
02:36:39 like that's his actual brain
02:36:41 that's his actual brain yeah
02:36:43 basically the island itself
02:36:45 or like a big chunk of it floating in the clouds
02:36:47 is just
02:36:49 his actual brain that he took out of his head
02:36:51 and he put in a big ball
02:36:53 and uh
02:36:55 yep like if the if the if he runs away
02:36:57 can't they just turn his brain off
02:36:59 and then he becomes dumb
02:37:01 I think they just destroy it
02:37:03 they I guess they wouldn't be allowed to destroy it
02:37:05 I think that if they
02:37:07 they could destroy if they destroyed
02:37:09 the brain I assume it would kill him
02:37:11 and if they killed
02:37:13 him I assume that the brain
02:37:15 would also die
02:37:17 uh
02:37:19 and but I mean
02:37:21 I don't know how they would use
02:37:23 the brain
02:37:25 without him like surely he is the one
02:37:29 who can use the brain
02:37:31 or maybe he has
02:37:33 some devices that interface with it
02:37:35 well he already has like
02:37:37 the other vega punks who are like
02:37:39 constructs that share his brain
02:37:41 yeah I assume and he was talking about
02:37:43 like what if the entire world could be linked
02:37:45 together and share knowledge
02:37:47 yeah like he's probably working on
02:37:49 the ability to disseminate information
02:37:51 that's probably like a thing you could work on
02:37:53 like I'm gonna tell everyone about
02:37:55 the void sentry
02:37:57 and then he's gonna broadcast it across
02:37:59 the whole world everyone's gonna know
02:38:01 everyone's gonna know it all at once
02:38:03 that's I predict that happening
02:38:05 I yeah
02:38:07 I think you're probably
02:38:09 right I think probably something like that
02:38:11 is gonna happen
02:38:13 and everyone's gonna be like
02:38:15 what the fuck the world government sucks
02:38:17 and they're gonna revolt all at once
02:38:19 it's funny because like everybody already knows
02:38:21 what the world government sucks
02:38:23 they kind of don't need to know
02:38:25 they kind of don't need to be told about
02:38:27 it would be unrealistic
02:38:29 if like some
02:38:31 because you know
02:38:33 in real life
02:38:35 the government declassifies
02:38:37 like secret documents about like
02:38:39 unbelievably fucked up shit the CIA did
02:38:41 all the time and nobody gives a shit
02:38:43 everyone's just like oh really
02:38:45 yeah okay that's fine
02:38:47 it's like how do you really fight that
02:38:49 they have the power to stop you
02:38:51 if you try and stop them
02:38:53 it's like yeah whatever
02:38:55 yeah yeah
02:38:57 it's a nice idea though
02:38:59 like oh everybody
02:39:01 lets unite and
02:39:03 overthrow them
02:39:05 sharing the secret of the void sentry
02:39:07 even if it's not like
02:39:09 oh well if they did that
02:39:11 then we've all gotta
02:39:13 revolt and fight them
02:39:15 even if it's not like that
02:39:17 there could still be
02:39:19 information
02:39:21 involved in that that is important
02:39:23 for something
02:39:25 I guess the only thing that I could imagine
02:39:27 is that the information
02:39:29 being disseminated like that
02:39:31 would mean that even the marines would turn on the world
02:39:33 government and so it would be everybody
02:39:35 in the world fighting against
02:39:37 this guy at the top
02:39:39 yeah
02:39:41 if it were if it were
02:39:43 if it were like
02:39:45 I mean if they're doing
02:39:47 I mean it seems like they're doing
02:39:49 like
02:39:51 the worst war crimes imaginable
02:39:53 like blowing up whole islands
02:39:55 with the freaking
02:39:57 pluton or whatever
02:39:59 there's pretty much nothing worse you can do
02:40:01 in this world than that
02:40:03 yeah
02:40:05 it would be the sort of thing that would
02:40:07 justify
02:40:09 good characters being in the marines
02:40:11 yeah there already are
02:40:13 some good characters in the marines like we've got
02:40:15 Kobe and stuff and like Kobe must be part of
02:40:17 like a marine network that's trying to
02:40:19 like change the marines from the inside
02:40:21 so
02:40:23 I feel like that's it's not
02:40:25 necessarily the case I think he's like he's a marine
02:40:27 and he's trying to do the right thing
02:40:29 and there are lots of marines like that
02:40:31 and I think even on
02:40:33 some level Ikeino is like that
02:40:35 they're not like
02:40:37 yeah I feel like if the information
02:40:39 about the void sentry was leaked
02:40:42 a lot of marines
02:40:44 that are like Ikeino is the sort of
02:40:46 character who like
02:40:48 is very honorable
02:40:50 and does like
02:40:52 you know he's very strict
02:40:54 but if he learns that he'll be like
02:40:56 I can't in good conscience
02:40:58 support this any bit longer and he'll be like
02:41:00 ah cool like a bad guy turned good moment
02:41:02 isn't Ikeino like a complete bastard though
02:41:05 yeah I mean yeah but like
02:41:07 he's only a bastard in the way that he's like
02:41:09 you damn pirates
02:41:11 I kind of think I don't know my impression
02:41:13 of Ikeino is that he
02:41:15 would justify like
02:41:17 anything like in this for the sake of like
02:41:19 peacekeeping or whatever
02:41:21 he'd be totally fine with war crimes
02:41:23 I don't know
02:41:25 could be
02:41:27 I don't feel like he doesn't feel like
02:41:29 final boss evil
02:41:31 I guess neither does Blackbeard
02:41:33 in the same sense that like Blackbeard's
02:41:35 just self-centered he just wants power
02:41:37 yeah
02:41:39 I just like I like the trope of
02:41:41 I just really like the trope of the guy
02:41:43 who you don't expect to be a friend
02:41:45 will be friend you
02:41:47 when is needed
02:41:49 maybe
02:41:51 like oh Luffy and Ikeino like
02:41:53 I killed your brother but we got to kill
02:41:55 the world government instead
02:41:57 but that's all
02:41:59 that's for later for now
02:42:01 we gotta
02:42:03 prevent war crimes Luffy
02:42:05 I mean he came here to kick ass
02:42:07 and prevent war crimes
02:42:09 and I'm all out of ass to kick so
02:42:11 let's prevent some war crimes
02:42:13 I guess I don't know
02:42:15 like Fujitora definitely strikes me
02:42:17 as a good marine
02:42:19 who is just doing his job
02:42:21 and would revolt
02:42:23 against the world government if it came to it
02:42:25 Ikeino is a one you wouldn't expect
02:42:27 which is why I like the idea
02:42:29 but yeah there's like Smoker
02:42:31 there's Kobe, Helma Po
02:42:33 who else
02:42:35 there's a few other marines I think
02:42:37 there's that old lady
02:42:39 who's always around
02:42:41 to me
02:42:43 in my mind
02:42:45 Ikeino sort of represents
02:42:47 like pretty much the worst
02:42:49 of the worst elements of the marines
02:42:51 he's the one who will like
02:42:53 dispense
02:42:55 justice that is
02:42:57 and that justice can be as brutal
02:42:59 as it needs to be and he doesn't care
02:43:01 as long as it's like justice dispensed
02:43:03 by the book
02:43:05 I suppose
02:43:07 I guess
02:43:09 I don't think I've heard
02:43:11 that the marines have become
02:43:13 more evil under Ikeino
02:43:15 like it's not like
02:43:17 the marines have started to become bad
02:43:19 people more so than under
02:43:21 Sengoku
02:43:23 I mean they're already bad
02:43:25 I know that but you know what I mean
02:43:27 Yeah
02:43:29 Sengoku is kind of a good guy
02:43:31 but the marines were still bad
02:43:33 still bad
02:43:35 I don't think there's anything
02:43:37 that's necessarily changed
02:43:39 I don't feel like anything has necessarily
02:43:41 changed at least not like
02:43:43 explicitly with Ikeino being in charge
02:43:45 oh my god the societal issues
02:43:47 they were systemic it's not just
02:43:49 about replacing the one guy at the top
02:43:51 oh my god
02:43:55 oh my god you mean it's just about
02:43:57 investing individuals
02:43:59 with the power to
02:44:01 fucking oppress people at will
02:44:03 and that's the problem
02:44:05 no
02:44:07 that would say something about society
02:44:09 I love One Piece
02:44:11 I do
02:44:13 it's true
02:44:15 yeah you know it is unlikely
02:44:17 that Ikeino would like be a good guy
02:44:19 right at the end
02:44:21 but it's wishful thinking because I just
02:44:23 love the trope I just love that trope
02:44:25 yeah he would have blown up the earth
02:44:27 he really would have
02:44:29 and then he got beat up and he's like
02:44:31 oh I love that do it again
02:44:37 yeah but I mean
02:44:39 Vegeta had
02:44:41 motives
02:44:43 I understand I mean I'm in shirt
02:44:45 Ikeino could have motives
02:44:47 that might
02:44:49 affect his behavior
02:44:51 when I was a little boy
02:44:53 and he took a shit
02:44:55 on my favorite toy and I cried
02:44:57 and then from that day on
02:44:59 I said I'll kill that pirate
02:45:01 now
02:45:03 but now I realize
02:45:05 that the marines shit on even more
02:45:07 toys
02:45:09 they shit with our giant lasers
02:45:17 I think
02:45:19 the One Piece
02:45:21 is the friends they made along the way
02:45:23 true
02:45:25 we are One Piece
02:45:27 of the puzzle
02:45:29 of life
02:45:31 the One Piece is
02:45:35 world peace
02:45:37 I mean
02:45:39 you know what the One Piece is
02:45:41 have I said what I think the One Piece is
02:45:43 I think so I forgot though
02:45:45 what did you say
02:45:47 to me
02:45:49 the foreshadowing
02:45:51 seems clear
02:45:53 that the One Piece
02:45:55 refers to the unification
02:45:57 of the four seas
02:45:59 which will be achieved
02:46:01 by destroying marriage war
02:46:03 and shattering the red line
02:46:05 and combining the four blues
02:46:07 into the all blue
02:46:09 it's the one world
02:46:11 the unified world
02:46:13 is the One Piece
02:46:15 that comes with implications
02:46:17 that whatever happened in the void century
02:46:19 was
02:46:21 is like maybe involved
02:46:23 the ancient weapons building
02:46:25 the red line to split everything up
02:46:27 and put marriage war right at the top
02:46:29 maybe
02:46:31 they earth bent
02:46:33 the red line into existence
02:46:35 using an ancient weapon
02:46:37 like there was no marriage war
02:46:39 and no red line
02:46:41 actually
02:46:43 the red line is a very
02:46:45 makes them easier to control
02:46:47 if they can like split them up
02:46:49 and it's like a
02:46:51 maybe a parallel
02:46:53 to like the Berlin wall
02:46:55 and things like that
02:46:57 I kind of never even really thought about it
02:46:59 but yeah you know
02:47:01 the red line is a very strange geographic feature
02:47:03 maybe they might have created it artificially somehow
02:47:07 so yeah
02:47:09 I definitely agree with like
02:47:11 the red line of marriage war
02:47:13 being broken and then all blue and all that
02:47:15 that's a good theory
02:47:17 and I think
02:47:19 will definitely come to pass
02:47:21 the fact, what's your name
02:47:23 the mermaid oracle
02:47:25 or whatever
02:47:27 the one that like prophesied
02:47:29 that would destroy fishman island
02:47:31 and then because
02:47:33 fishman island is directly below marriage war
02:47:35 marriage war, yeah
02:47:37 then they're going to be
02:47:39 falling on them
02:47:41 it's going to be pretty fucked
02:47:43 it's not going to be good
02:47:45 it's not going to be good for those guys
02:47:47 in particular
02:47:49 yeah and then
02:47:51 of course
02:47:53 red line gets broken, laboon comes through
02:47:55 and he's like haha it's we laboon
02:47:57 and then brooks finally meets him
02:47:59 oh wait I forgot
02:48:01 the one piece actually
02:48:03 refers to brook and laboon
02:48:05 reuniting and becoming one pair
02:48:07 of best friends forever
02:48:09 yes
02:48:11 and that's why roger laughed because he didn't know
02:48:13 who laboon was
02:48:15 yeah of course
02:48:17 he said laboon
02:48:19 haha what does that mean I don't understand
02:48:21 anyway I'm going to die of cancer
02:48:23 now goodbye
02:48:25 exactly
02:48:29 what did that's
02:48:31 roger laughed when he saw
02:48:33 one piece right when he saw what was on
02:48:35 rafthel
02:48:37 he went to rafthel and it was like
02:48:39 either a pony glyph or a treasure
02:48:41 or I don't think it was the one piece
02:48:43 or maybe it was
02:48:45 it must have been something
02:48:47 left by joyboy
02:48:49 wait a minute
02:48:51 one piece is the name for roger's treasure
02:48:53 roger left something
02:48:55 and that's one piece
02:48:57 so he didn't find one piece
02:48:59 one piece didn't really exist before roger
02:49:01 unless
02:49:03 I mean I guess he could have found something
02:49:05 yeah
02:49:07 he went to rafthel
02:49:09 yeah that was the thing
02:49:11 roger searched the entire grand line
02:49:13 and he figured out the void sentry
02:49:15 by reading the pony glyphs
02:49:17 and that made him
02:49:19 probably reading the final pony glyph
02:49:21 and learning the secret of the void sentry
02:49:23 is probably what made him laugh
02:49:25 yeah and joyboy
02:49:27 I think there was a thing on rafthel that joyboy left
02:49:29 like either a story
02:49:31 or like a pony glyph special
02:49:33 something that they
02:49:35 yeah so the previous
02:49:37 presumably the previous user
02:49:39 of luffy's devil fruit
02:49:43 and so
02:49:45 he laughed when he found
02:49:47 either the knowledge or the item
02:49:49 that contained the knowledge
02:49:51 and they just like ha ha
02:49:53 I've got freaking chills
02:49:55 I've got freaking chills
02:49:57 I can't adequately
02:49:59 express how much
02:50:01 I get out of
02:50:03 one piece is like thematic
02:50:05 use of like
02:50:07 smiling and laughter
02:50:09 and joy
02:50:11 it's like so good
02:50:15 they have such big smiles
02:50:17 they have such big teeth
02:50:23 they sure do
02:50:25 that's how I knew
02:50:27 that's how I know this marine was a fishman
02:50:29 because he had spiky R long teeth
02:50:33 and funny BDAs
02:50:35 that's how you know
02:50:37 that's the tell
02:50:39 sometimes
02:50:41 unless they're like a different kind of fish
02:50:43 doesn't have that
02:50:45 and that's not the tell
02:50:47 well do we have anything else
02:50:49 to say about one piece
02:50:51 oh sorry

02:54:17 ben
02:54:19 3 2 1 go
02:54:21 I can be here all day
02:54:23 and if I send someone
02:54:25 into a spiral through my conversation
02:54:27 with them we're there now thinking all day
02:54:29 sometimes I feel guilty about that
02:54:31 like I really try not to get
02:54:33 so real with people about
02:54:35 what I read in their communication
02:54:37 it's going to like fuck with their ability
02:54:39 to be themselves
02:54:41 because most people
02:54:43 don't know where to go with that
02:54:45 you can't just like experience
02:54:47 an ego death and then just
02:54:49 go back to work the next
02:54:51 day and like
02:54:53 well ok you will
02:54:55 but it will just wear off
02:54:57 basically that's what I'm saying
02:54:59 you can't just be
02:55:01 what the fuck
02:55:03 I don't get it I think it's a little too
02:55:05 out of context
02:55:07 I mean I think it sounds like she is saying
02:55:11 I think this is a little bit like
02:55:13 aww people knew what I was really thinking
02:55:15 it's like
02:55:17 I don't tell people
02:55:19 it's like ok I get it
02:55:21 it's like
02:55:23 I'm so smart and so
02:55:25 perceptive that if I told people
02:55:27 what I can immediately
02:55:29 tell and intuit about them
02:55:31 from the things they say to me
02:55:33 it would literally destroy them
02:55:35 it would break their mind
02:55:37 it would shatter their psyche and give them an ego death
02:55:39 but I don't do that
02:55:41 I spare them from that
02:55:43 because it would be cruel
02:55:45 to impart
02:55:47 that forbidden knowledge to them
02:55:49 they're better off not knowing
02:55:51 could it not be
02:55:53 that you say something about someone
02:55:55 that's untrue and also offensive
02:55:57 and then they get mad
02:55:59 could that also be the case
02:56:01 is that
02:56:03 it is never the case
02:56:05 that like a snap
02:56:07 a snap judgment I come to when I hear you say something
02:56:09 or I see something that you say
02:56:11 it's never me just assuming
02:56:13 it's a profound insight
02:56:15 that I've had into you
02:56:17 every single time
02:56:19 every single time
02:56:21 and that's just what you gotta keep in mind
02:56:27 we live in a society
02:56:29 that's pretty funny
02:56:31 honestly pretty funny quote
02:56:33 next one is called
02:56:35 the legend
02:56:37 3 2 1 go
02:56:39 have you heard the legend of Archimedes
02:56:41 no
02:56:43 yeah
02:56:45 no
02:56:47 no
02:56:49 isn't Archimedes one of the vagapunks
02:56:51 I was thinking of Achilles
02:56:53 I guess I haven't seen Archimedes nuts
02:56:55 Archimedes
02:56:57 who
02:56:59 jumped out of the bath
02:57:01 and said Eureka Eureka
02:57:03 yeah that guy
02:57:05 and he invented the screw
02:57:07 he jumped out of the bath and he said Eureka
02:57:09 Eureka Eureka
02:57:11 Eureka Eureka Eureka
02:57:13 he said these nuts they Eureka they Eureka
02:57:15 I gotta take a bath to make them smell better
02:57:19 that's why he was in a bath yes
02:57:21 he invented the screw
02:57:23 like he screwed everyone
02:57:25 he invented sex
02:57:27 I love him
02:57:29 do you know about the Archimedes screw
02:57:31 do you know how that works
02:57:33 oh the Archimedes screw
02:57:35 it's a little device
02:57:37 that transport you could transport liquids
02:57:39 up a vertical
02:57:41 oh yes I know about those
02:57:43 they used them in fucking aqueducts
02:57:45 he probably invented
02:57:47 other things as well
02:57:49 in fucking roman something or others
02:57:51 maybe not roman things
02:57:53 he invented it might just be named after him
02:57:55 now that I think about it
02:57:57 I don't know
02:57:59 yeah displacement
02:58:01 yes I know about Archimedes yes I read one piece
02:58:03 isn't he one of the robots
02:58:05 I don't remember
02:58:07 I don't think so
02:58:09 one of them is Edison
02:58:11 I kind of thought one was named Archimedes
02:58:13 oh well
02:58:15 wait maybe I'm thinking
02:58:17 is that the name of like
02:58:19 Night Owls
02:58:21 Night Owls ship
02:58:23 in
02:58:25 Watchmen
02:58:27 or something
02:58:29 I don't know
02:58:31 yes it is
02:58:33 Night Owls little
02:58:35 Fly in Batmobile is called Archimedes
02:58:37 okay

02:59:05 I never see this one anymore
02:59:07 I never see this comic anymore
02:59:09 I feel like I've seen it like a handful of times
02:59:11 you see it all the time
02:59:13 what's going on up here
02:59:15 this racket going on up here son
02:59:17 you're watching your internet talk show again
02:59:19 it's called PCP dead
02:59:21 it's not about drugs and it's not to use anime podcasts
02:59:23 this is where the best of voicemails is a deep intricate lore
02:59:25 that normally you wouldn't understand
02:59:27 watch for a second
02:59:29 so the other day I took a bus to Oldies
02:59:31 and there was a homeless guy on the bus
02:59:33 and he smelled really bad
02:59:35 I talked to the girl and I had to get off the bus
02:59:37 the next stop we started just talking to each other
02:59:39 until the last stop so then I had to find my way back
02:59:41 so that's nice
02:59:43 that's nice dear
02:59:45 son how can you watch this
02:59:47 there's no name

03:00:05 oh wait the original has the dad
03:00:07 I know the dad from a lot of stuff
03:00:09 they stopped using the comic
03:00:11 yeah
03:00:13 the original is like
03:00:15 you watching them girl cartoons
03:00:17 again son it's like it's called anime dad
03:00:19 and then the third panel is like
03:00:21 some stupid anime shit
03:00:23 and the dad just
03:00:25 that's one
03:00:27 son how can you watch this
03:00:29 there's no name
03:00:31 what the fuck
03:00:33 who's gonna teach you to be straight and white
03:00:37 what am I doing in this panel
03:00:39 I think you're ironing
03:00:41 a shirt
03:00:43 or something
03:00:45 that's nice dear
03:00:47 I just said
03:00:49 there's a vacant expression on my face
03:00:51 my like glass eyes looking
03:00:53 in two different directions
03:00:55 feels good
03:00:57 no thoughts head empty
03:01:01 next one is another image
03:01:03 another image
03:01:05 let's look at it
03:01:07 let's freaking look
03:01:09 uh
03:01:11 uh
03:01:13 yeah I get it
03:01:15 I get it
03:01:19 now you're banging her Ben
03:01:21 no
03:01:23 it would be
03:01:25 that's where it would go
03:01:27 it would be she's
03:01:29 who's banging who
03:01:31 hang on
03:01:33 it's like
03:01:35 Jeff or whatever
03:01:37 wear your pants
03:01:39 oh I took them off because I was banging your mom for a minute there
03:01:41 and now you are banging her
03:01:43 hehehe like that's the comic
03:01:45 so in this situation
03:01:47 you would be banging her at this very moment
03:01:49 hang on I have to I have to confirm
03:01:53 you can't remember this one that's the best one
03:01:55 I just can't remember the exact
03:01:57 machinations
03:01:59 of it
03:02:01 bro
03:02:03 I took them off because I was banging your mom for a minute there
03:02:05 and now you are banging her
03:02:07 okay
03:02:09 well I think you should switch them
03:02:11 I think Christine should be on the left
03:02:13 and I should be on the right because the
03:02:15 I mean the punchline should be that it ends with Chris
03:02:17 banging her own mom right
03:02:19 and that's not the situation
03:02:21 that's not the situation you've constructed here
03:02:23 well it's
03:02:25 it's past tense
03:02:27 it happened
03:02:29 oh that's right
03:02:31 Chris's mom is not even involved in this situation
03:02:33 this is a misplay
03:02:35 oh that's true
03:02:37 this is Ben's mom
03:02:39 yeah and that's just disrespectful
03:02:43 thanks for the voicemail
03:02:45 so in the other one if it was switch
03:02:47 you would be banging
03:02:49 Chris's mom
03:02:51 well no I think
03:02:53 I should be saying yeah dude
03:02:55 I was banging your mom for a minute there
03:02:57 and now you are banging her
03:02:59 hehehe
03:03:01 that's how it should go
03:03:09 I'm sorry
03:03:11 I'm looking at the original comic again
03:03:13 hehehe
03:03:15 I love it so much
03:03:17 I gotta post it
03:03:19 I gotta fucking post it
03:03:21 I always read it as hehehe
03:03:27 I would say
03:03:29 I guess
03:03:31 I only think of a hair
03:03:33 when it's got an H at the end
03:03:35 yeah that's fair
03:03:37 but I mean I would say if I were saying he
03:03:39 I would spell it with two E's
03:03:41 well that's why
03:03:43 sweet brown hella Jeff
03:03:45 it's so cool
03:03:47 it bugs the trends of normal typing
03:03:49 it makes you think
03:03:51 it makes you
03:03:53 makes you question
03:03:55 makes you question everything
03:03:57 okay
03:03:59 the next one is called
03:04:01 you know
03:04:03 3 2 1 go
03:04:05 what do you think
03:04:07 when you are not
03:04:09 thinking anything
03:04:11 what does your mind go everyday to
03:04:13 I always
03:04:15 go to
03:04:17 monkey
03:04:19 and also
03:04:23 monkey
03:04:25 where does your mind go
03:04:27 that's hard to know
03:04:31 I think about
03:04:33 stuff being gay
03:04:35 like this like
03:04:37 like gay
03:04:39 that's gay I don't know
03:04:41 sometimes I just default to thinking about
03:04:43 calling things gay in my head
03:04:45 oops
03:04:47 homophobic
03:04:49 I don't know how to answer this question
03:04:51 I
03:04:53 like
03:04:55 when my mind's not
03:04:57 occupied with any particular thought
03:04:59 I also think
03:05:01 about like aw fuck
03:05:03 I'm gonna kill myself
03:05:05 but in like a funny way
03:05:07 in like a funny and cool way
03:05:09 not in like a weird way though
03:05:11 that's a good default
03:05:13 thought that I have a lot
03:05:15 just like wall kill myself
03:05:17 you know
03:05:19 oh like words I would use
03:05:21 if I was just
03:05:23 making up some song
03:05:25 like a rap
03:05:27 to nothing in particular
03:05:29 and I default to some specific words
03:05:31 like chicken and motherfucker
03:05:33 because I like the
03:05:35 the rhythm they have
03:05:37 but that's not the same as like what thoughts enter my head
03:05:39 when I'm not really thinking about anything
03:05:41 don't know how to answer
03:05:43 I'll have to think about it
03:05:45 um
03:05:47 yeah
03:05:49 gay
03:05:51 gay kill myself
03:05:53 that's pretty much it
03:05:55 I guess you two poop quotes
03:05:57 they enter my head pretty frequently
03:05:59 like lampoil rope bombs
03:06:01 it's yours my friend
03:06:03 as long as you have enough rubies
03:06:05 that's a pretty fun one
03:06:07 that's a pretty fun one
03:06:09 mine's not that fun
03:06:11 mine's not that funny
03:06:13 alright next one
03:06:15 download that one
03:06:17 next one is called appreciating ben saint
03:06:19 vomit
03:06:21 3 2 1 go
03:06:23 I've finally been watching ben's
03:06:25 winnie the pooh retrospectives
03:06:27 and they're good I like the videos
03:06:29 one of these days
03:06:31 but I've noticed that like
03:06:33 either it's because
03:06:35 ben has become
03:06:37 funnier over the years
03:06:39 or it's because
03:06:41 of like the effects of
03:06:43 either more speaking
03:06:45 ad-lib style versus
03:06:47 speaking on a more like
03:06:49 maybe scripted basis
03:06:51 in like more video essay-ish
03:06:53 style in those winnie the pooh videos
03:06:55 but I feel like these days
03:06:57 in like the more modern lecture content
03:06:59 I find
03:07:01 ben a lot funnier
03:07:03 these days
03:07:05 even some like
03:07:07 podcast moment just like random
03:07:09 offhand comments make me laugh way more
03:07:11 than like
03:07:13 anything that's like a scripted joke
03:07:15 in the video
03:07:17 essay thingies
03:07:19 and I just thought that that was interesting
03:07:21 just you know
03:07:23 none of those scripted jokes can live up to
03:07:25 king you nerd
03:07:27 from the fucking mega man
03:07:29 video I don't know
03:07:31 makes me chuckle
03:07:33 that's funny
03:07:35 that's funny because I did have
03:07:37 a couple of like scripted jokes that I sort of
03:07:39 like wrote ahead of time
03:07:41 in the lecture
03:07:43 I didn't
03:07:45 I did kind of have notes
03:07:47 for the winnie the pooh the winnie the pooh is
03:07:49 off the cuff but I do have like
03:07:51 notes that I'm like pretty closely
03:07:53 following in like the things that I talk about
03:07:55 I didn't really write
03:07:57 many like jokes for it though I wasn't really trying
03:07:59 to be funny
03:08:01 yeah I felt like I mean it's not like
03:08:03 you weren't funny around that time
03:08:05 I feel like the winnie the pooh
03:08:07 videos were like more
03:08:09 deliberately serious
03:08:11 in tone and that's why
03:08:13 I don't like they have
03:08:15 a different sort of feeling than other videos
03:08:17 you had made and other appearances
03:08:19 on podcasts and stuff
03:08:21 well I think I did
03:08:23 occasionally think of like a funny
03:08:25 thing to say
03:08:27 or a joke to put in there I don't think
03:08:29 I did much of that I think I wasn't
03:08:31 really prioritizing
03:08:33 comedy I wasn't really trying to be funny
03:08:35 that much
03:08:37 and I was mostly
03:08:39 yeah focused on like
03:08:43 getting writing my thoughts down
03:08:45 and then discussing my
03:08:47 my like you know just my earnest
03:08:49 thoughts about like
03:08:51 the each episode of the show
03:08:53 so maybe it was just like priorities
03:08:55 is the reason why
03:08:57 I don't think I'm funny
03:08:59 ever
03:09:01 you make me laugh all the time
03:09:03 yeah I make myself
03:09:05 laugh too but that just means
03:09:07 that I'm not funny
03:09:09 because you shouldn't laugh at your own jokes
03:09:11 that's like not good
03:09:15 God I did it again
03:09:19 I was trying to do
03:09:21 like a mean thing I was trying to do mean
03:09:23 spirited like oh you make me laugh
03:09:25 as in like I laugh at you because
03:09:27 you're amusing as a human
03:09:29 specimen
03:09:31 but I don't know how to like
03:09:33 I don't know how to do that
03:09:35 set that up so that it makes sense
03:09:37 no you did great
03:09:39 no you did great
03:09:41 I had to explain the joke I ruined it
03:09:43 no that's good
03:09:45 oh you got me
03:09:47 no
03:09:51 when will Ben St know that I hate him
03:09:53 oh how I hate him
03:09:55 that Charlie Brown
03:09:57 was it like that Charlie Brown
03:09:59 what a guy what a guy
03:10:01 what a fellow that Charlie Brown
03:10:03 and then as soon as he's off the screen
03:10:05 how I hate him
03:10:07 yes
03:10:09 I guess I don't really have anything else
03:10:13 to say I should finish that one
03:10:15 we need a poo thing
03:10:17 there's just not enough
03:10:19 time in the week
03:10:21 I can't believe it's another week already
03:10:23 another week got away from me

03:10:29 next one is
03:10:31 an image
03:10:33 there it is
03:10:35 it's I believe it is you
03:10:37 and Munchie
03:10:39 yes but why are we
03:10:41 individually
03:10:43 why are we saying these things
03:10:45 oh is it like split
03:10:47 like not split personality
03:10:49 like swapped
03:10:51 you would usually be the other way around
03:10:53 I
03:10:55 I feel like neither of you say either of these things
03:10:57 no me either
03:10:59 I feel like there's a joke here but like I
03:11:01 I'm not getting it
03:11:03 like why because you got a long neck
03:11:05 yeah what's what's up with that
03:11:09 yeah I don't know
03:11:13 I like that I like my face
03:11:15 I look like Simpsons

03:11:23 highlights
03:11:25 textured
03:11:27 feathered
03:11:29 I
03:11:31 I don't know what else to say about this one
03:11:33 if there's a joke I don't get it
03:11:35 sorry
03:11:37 next one is
03:11:39 an album
03:11:41 new PCP logo
03:11:43 oh
03:11:45 I get it
03:11:47 is this a rebel pixels
03:11:49 joke or is it just
03:11:51 I think it's just our colors
03:11:53 even though mine is not really
03:11:55 that's that's too blue that's more of a
03:11:57 DeVue color that's more of DeVue blue
03:11:59 than Gibb turquoise
03:12:01 I do like that blue though
03:12:03 look nothing nothing against that
03:12:05 I'm all about those Aquamarine
03:12:07 blues and greens
03:12:09 nothing against that particular blue
03:12:11 just bluer than what I was
03:12:13 imagining
03:12:15 also blue in the face
03:12:17 I mean those two
03:12:19 the two do look good together
03:12:21 that blue and that black
03:12:23 yeah
03:12:25 it's funny
03:12:27 the other seven just empty
03:12:29 just gone desolate
03:12:31 no
03:12:33 I think
03:12:35 do we already talk
03:12:37 maybe on the stream I think we talked about
03:12:39 I think I floated the idea of
03:12:41 the logo for
03:12:43 the perfect comic party
03:12:45 new channel logo
03:12:47 yeah yeah
03:12:49 we will debut that at some point perhaps
03:12:51 I'll maybe work
03:12:53 yeah I'll maybe work on
03:12:55 drawing up a more
03:12:57 proper version of the
03:12:59 the logo
03:13:01 the title today
03:13:03 oh it's exciting
03:13:05 it gives me a hopeful
03:13:07 feeling about the future
03:13:09 the first time
03:13:11 ever
03:13:13 next one is
03:13:15 Rod Serling
03:13:17 Slime and
03:13:19 Editing
03:13:21 3, 2, 1, go
03:13:43 for now finally the day has come
03:13:45 the books are edited
03:13:47 printed and out the door
03:13:49 then the reviews roll in
03:13:51 and opening up twitter you are horrified
03:13:53 to find
03:13:55 too thin
03:13:57 this book is too thin they say
03:13:59 why aren't there more pages with less information
03:14:01 it's been seen
03:14:03 girth shaming or something
03:14:05 you're cancelled IRL
03:14:07 and wither into a cyber realm
03:14:09 and you realize what you should have realized
03:14:11 there's always
03:14:13 always
03:14:15 something wrong
03:14:17 true
03:14:19 it's true that is a nightmare
03:14:21 and I think that we should
03:14:23 I think we should normalize
03:14:25 cyberizing people into cyber elves
03:14:27 as a punishment
03:14:29 that was like the worst possible fate
03:14:31 cancelling somebody
03:14:33 so they turn into a cyber elf
03:14:35 they shrink and contort
03:14:37 no more body
03:14:39 no more physical
03:14:41 incarnation in the physical world
03:14:43 to cyberspace with you
03:14:45 cyber elves
03:14:47 can appear in reality
03:14:49 but only briefly is that how they work
03:14:51 they can appear in reality
03:14:53 but they can't do anything
03:14:55 most of the time
03:14:57 they can't do anything without
03:14:59 pretty much expending all their energy
03:15:01 and basically killing themselves
03:15:03 so they're like a cool flashy looking ghost
03:15:05 yes
03:15:07 exactly
03:15:09 a cool flashy looking ghost
03:15:11 that has a
03:15:13 that usually has like a one time
03:15:15 like
03:15:17 thing they can choose to die
03:15:19 to accomplish if they feel like it
03:15:21 but some of them
03:15:23 making a cup hover
03:15:25 um
03:15:27 yeah and then they're just gonna
03:15:29 that's the last thing they ever do
03:15:31 yeah
03:15:33 they're like a cool looking ghost
03:15:35 you can see
03:15:37 um next one
03:15:39 do I have anything else to say about that
03:15:41 um the book is
03:15:43 the book is probably gonna be
03:15:45 it's looking like the index is probably gonna be like
03:15:47 50 to 60 pages
03:15:49 so looking like the total page count is gonna be like
03:15:51 260 pages
03:15:53 that's pretty thick
03:15:55 that's pretty good
03:15:57 that's pretty girthy I would say
03:15:59 about 60 of that
03:16:01 so about a fifth of that will be
03:16:03 which is fine
03:16:05 you know whatever
03:16:07 next one is
03:16:09 he had to confirm
03:16:11 3, 2, 1, go
03:16:13 ah Ben's saying is just like
03:16:15 Ben's just
03:16:17 getting a voicemail of someone
03:16:19 shitting their fucking bottles out on the toilet
03:16:21 diarrhea farting into the toilet
03:16:23 and he's just like
03:16:25 oh no
03:16:27 listen don't play it on the episode
03:16:29 but I have to listen to
03:16:31 the whole thing
03:16:33 it was gross
03:16:35 just a second more
03:16:37 oh
03:16:39 I have to confirm that it's just shitting
03:16:41 it's like
03:16:43 can you imagine if I could smell this
03:16:45 too
03:16:47 imagine if I put your hand
03:16:49 into the bowl and scoop some of it out
03:16:51 oh god that would be so fucking gross
03:16:53 that would be so crazy
03:16:55 unless
03:16:57 look
03:16:59 I was like already halfway through it
03:17:01 so
03:17:03 then you can sleeve halfway through it
03:17:05 so I was like well I've listened to this much of it
03:17:07 I might as well
03:17:09 listen to the rest
03:17:11 ah god
03:17:13 you gotta learn to jump shit
03:17:15 you gotta learn to run away
03:17:17 you know
03:17:19 just like with a slime and punishment book
03:17:21 at some point you gotta cut and run
03:17:23 you gotta call it done
03:17:25 I've heard enough of this shit
03:17:27 literally literal
03:17:29 and it's time to end it
03:17:31 next one is called
03:17:33 slime times weekend update

03:17:43 and the rest give asked
03:17:45 and here we are again
03:17:47 there are no female killers
03:17:49 killsers
03:17:51 sorry
03:17:53 the old head
03:17:55 he promised to give it once 15 people
03:17:57 had made art for him
03:17:59 and the gangs took to ms paint
03:18:01 beautiful art was made
03:18:03 and the relic was finally awarded to a killer
03:18:05 known as stin bug
03:18:07 also endless war seems to have been getting
03:18:09 a mighty migraine from all the new cops
03:18:11 roaming around the streets
03:18:13 because people have been encountering numerous
03:18:15 anomalies upon dying
03:18:17 from staying dead
03:18:19 in featureless voids
03:18:21 to speak of
03:18:23 and no data
03:18:25 or your data being completely
03:18:27 swiped from existence
03:18:29 oh my satan the pain won't ever end
03:18:31 tech developers are hard at work
03:18:33 in endless wars bowels
03:18:35 to see if they can fix things
03:18:37 for interview they had this to say
03:18:39 oh maybe this wire
03:18:41 and then oh god oh no
03:18:43 dear christ
03:18:45 we wish them the best of luck
03:18:47 onto the next part
03:18:49 levy jevy was around that's crazy
03:18:51 that guy is fucking
03:18:53 that guy disappeared into the
03:18:55 into the freaking deaths
03:18:57 that's wild
03:18:59 that's wild
03:19:01 wow
03:19:03 and yeah get up all in those bowels
03:19:05 anyway next part is part two
03:19:07 three two one go
03:19:09 part two finally
03:19:11 right after the graffiti contest was judged
03:19:13 suddenly a fiddle by the name of
03:19:15 morty came out in front of the crowd
03:19:17 and assassinated the mayor
03:19:19 bang execution style
03:19:21 the mayoral role was all rabs
03:19:23 and friends have already begun to backstab
03:19:25 and slander each other over it
03:19:27 there's no telling what will happen yet
03:19:29 but if the last mayoral election
03:19:31 was anything to go by
03:19:33 we should expect nothing but good things
03:19:37 I've heard it now under the authority that
03:19:39 captain metalhead is running on
03:19:41 the mayor lord of ghost
03:19:43 to electric boogaloo
03:19:45 I like the sign of that
03:19:47 maybe the second time
03:19:49 that's it for this one and remember
03:19:51 the slime time is the best time
03:19:53 oh yes
03:19:55 and we at the redaction
03:19:57 of the
03:19:59 slime times weekend update
03:20:01 we're very excited to hear about
03:20:03 the new zine
03:20:05 or karmic
03:20:07 strip shonen jump
03:20:09 eskstein coming out
03:20:11 and the suggestion that perhaps
03:20:13 there should be a slime time
03:20:15 section mentioned
03:20:17 we would be more than happy to contribute
03:20:19 if that was ever wanted
03:20:21 anyways
03:20:23 goodbye excited for that

03:20:31 print it in the
03:20:33 the issues when we start
03:20:35 making them
03:20:37 there used to be
03:20:39 those guys used to make
03:20:41 the actual slime times newspaper
03:20:43 they used to make a digital
03:20:45 publication
03:20:47 I loved that
03:20:49 we could
03:20:51 bring that back a little bit
03:20:53 this is going to be so cool
03:20:55 because it's not just going to be like

03:21:13 we could make
03:21:15 the front cover really busy
03:21:17 I love busy covers
03:21:19 it would be
03:21:21 that's fun
03:21:23 I like the idea
03:21:25 I like the idea of having
03:21:27 a lot of people
03:21:29 just kind of that have stuff to contribute
03:21:31 but
03:21:33 I mean I would want to be
03:21:35 picky about it
03:21:37 I mean the slime times weekend
03:21:39 update is great so if they just
03:21:41 turn that into text

03:29:37 the cutscenes
03:29:39 seem very different
03:29:41 from the very small
03:29:43 moments of gameplay
03:29:45 shown there but
03:29:47 I don't know might
03:29:49 work might be I liked
03:29:51 I liked the way I mean the the 3d looks
03:29:53 pretty low poly and low res
03:29:55 but I did like
03:29:57 it being
03:29:59 paired with like the quite
03:30:01 high quality 2d animation
03:30:03 characters in the world the animation
03:30:05 stands out to me a lot more
03:30:07 than the game
03:30:09 which is okay
03:30:11 that's like how the videos are as well
03:30:13 they're like in a weird like windows
03:30:15 98 95
03:30:17 like they something or other
03:30:19 world kind of look like
03:30:21 yeah they're like in like a low
03:30:23 poly sort of 3d
03:30:25 and they sort of like a like visual
03:30:27 novel like the character is kind of
03:30:29 facing you and like talking
03:30:31 at you
03:30:33 yeah yeah
03:30:35 philip cdi as well
03:30:37 the the
03:30:39 fucking hotel mario
03:30:41 the 2d animation is so
03:30:43 good looking
03:30:45 it almost looks like a completely different
03:30:47 thing
03:30:49 but
03:30:51 I'll watch it I'll keep I'll keep an eye on
03:30:53 it
03:30:55 did you uh
03:30:57 have you seen
03:30:59 this girl
03:31:01 I think she's on tiktok
03:31:03 but she's also on twitter
03:31:05 you know what I'm talking about
03:31:07 stop motion
03:31:09 really weird warped like
03:31:11 fucked with audio voice
03:31:13 creepy
03:31:15 staring sort of thing
03:31:17 yes but the one that's like
03:31:19 clicking on stuff like an adventure game
03:31:21 yeah an adventure game
03:31:23 and then she usually kills you
03:31:25 she usually kills you or
03:31:27 something
03:31:29 yeah something
03:31:31 help me find my dog
03:31:33 help me find my dog
03:31:35 you must be the
03:31:37 baby sitter
03:31:39 come in please
03:31:41 yeah
03:31:43 that's great
03:31:45 yeah I watched a bunch of those and I thought they're really good
03:31:47 uh
03:31:49 I think she mostly
03:31:51 does like only fans
03:31:53 she's like an only fans girl and her only fans
03:31:55 she's really unironic like it has nothing to do
03:31:57 with any of that stuff
03:31:59 it's just yeah
03:32:01 but like
03:32:03 that like horror
03:32:05 glitchy like game aesthetic stuff was like
03:32:07 I think it was really making the rounds on social media
03:32:09 like a couple weeks ago
03:32:11 I saw it and I looked into it and I was like
03:32:13 huh this stuff is neat
03:32:15 this stuff is like
03:32:17 I don't know some people call it horror
03:32:19 I didn't call it horror
03:32:21 it's sort of it has a creepy vibe
03:32:23 it's
03:32:25 it evokes a lot of
03:32:27 horror themed
03:32:29 things
03:32:31 it wasn't scary but it was like
03:32:33 this is really creative
03:32:35 I like that it was on tiktok
03:32:37 it was a bit creepy
03:32:39 it was kind of funny like the one where you're the baby sitter and your baby sitting
03:32:41 the fly baby
03:32:43 and then it ends with like
03:32:45 daddy's going to be mad
03:32:47 and she opens the door and like the giant
03:32:49 fly is outside like that made me laugh
03:32:51 like that's just
03:32:53 I'm not sure if it was going for comedy
03:32:55 but it was funny
03:32:59 to me
03:33:01 that stuff I don't know
03:33:03 that's what Ena
03:33:05 made me think of
03:33:07 I don't even remember that girl's name
03:33:09 but
03:33:11 whatever I'm not even

03:35:29 for its fourth play test
03:35:31 on february the sixth
03:35:33 you shouldn't miss out
03:35:35 on playing one of the greatest
03:35:37 games ever made
03:35:39 I've never heard of dark and darker
03:35:41 I am just expressing
03:35:43 my honest appreciation
03:35:45 for the amazing
03:35:47 game known as dark and
03:35:49 darker
03:35:51 but seriously
03:35:53 Ben saint
03:35:55 and
03:35:57 Gibb and take and
03:35:59 jesse
03:36:01 and mochi
03:36:03 and nat
03:36:05 and
03:36:07 digi and
03:36:09 tom
03:36:11 I wouldn't want you to
03:36:13 miss out on this amazing
03:36:15 game the play test
03:36:17 is only going to last for like 10 days
03:36:19 and you don't have to pay for it
03:36:21 it's free and it's on steam
03:36:23 it's called dark and darker and it's like
03:36:25 is this a joke I don't get it it's kind of like a roguelike
03:36:27 but
03:36:29 it's multiplayer battle royale roguelike
03:36:31 and it has pve
03:36:33 and it has pvp
03:36:35 it's the worst thing ever
03:36:37 you've got abilities
03:36:39 like two of them
03:36:41 there's not that many abilities it's not like league of legend
03:36:43 and
03:36:45 you get your sword
03:36:47 and you whack skeletons
03:36:49 and the games are
03:36:51 like 10 minutes long each
03:36:53 and I'm just so addicted to it
03:36:55 best game ever
03:36:57 I can't tell if that was
03:36:59 sincere does he actually like this game
03:37:01 I'm looking at the steam page and it looks
03:37:03 it looks like it could be good
03:37:05 but I hate
03:37:07 not roguelikes I hate
03:37:09 battle royales so I don't
03:37:11 I don't think I'll play that but yeah it's a fantasy
03:37:13 first person
03:37:15 something or other do you fight the other players
03:37:17 is that how it's a battle royale
03:37:19 and I'm forgiving hardcore fantasy
03:37:21 FPS dungeon p player versus
03:37:23 player versus environment adventure
03:37:25 band together with your friends and use your courage wits
03:37:27 and cunning to uncover mythical treasures
03:37:29 okay so it's sort of like
03:37:31 it sounds like it's like a
03:37:33 diablo thing almost
03:37:35 you're with your buddies in a dungeon
03:37:37 you're killing stuff
03:37:39 I think it sounds
03:37:41 potentially pretty fun
03:37:45 I don't know where the battle royale comes from
03:37:47 well I see people
03:37:49 like fighting each other in like a big group
03:37:51 in like the trailer
03:37:53 video
03:37:55 so it seems like
03:37:57 they're supposed to kill
03:37:59 maybe you're in a little party and you got to fight against other parties
03:38:01 oh no I see
03:38:03 I see a fortnite like death cloud
03:38:05 so they've got to get to the middle of the dungeon
03:38:07 get the loot
03:38:09 and then get out
03:38:11 I don't
03:38:13 know about the fortnite death cloud
03:38:15 the fortnite death cloud the idea
03:38:17 is that at the beginning of the map
03:38:19 everywhere is available
03:38:21 but slowly the death cloud a big circle
03:38:23 around the map will get smaller
03:38:25 forcing the players to interact
03:38:27 to get closer to the middle
03:38:29 so that like
03:38:31 if the players can't kill each other
03:38:33 the circle will kill everyone
03:38:37 okay
03:38:39 gotcha
03:38:41 okay I mean
03:38:43 looks kind of fun
03:38:45 I don't know if I'll actually play it
03:38:47 but
03:38:49 could be fun
03:38:51 wait
03:38:53 so this alpha playtest has ended
03:38:57 this guy was too late
03:38:59 we read this thing
03:39:01 oh was it
03:39:03 well it might have become
03:39:05 will this
03:39:07 stream next
03:39:09 he left this only 20 hours ago
03:39:11 I think he said that like another one
03:39:13 another test might be coming up
03:39:15 oh no yeah that's right
03:39:17 February 6th to 13th
03:39:21 so I guess come back then
03:39:25 could be fun
03:39:27 next one
03:39:29 is called a Gibbs weekly reminder
03:39:31 to reach the big twist in inscription
03:39:33 no
03:39:35 I'm playing
03:39:37 I'm playing Disco Elysium
03:39:39 and I didn't even get any weekly reminders this week
03:39:41 dab
03:39:43 dab
03:39:45 that means you've forgotten all about the dots
03:39:47 around chapter 2
03:39:49 what even is that nobody knows
03:39:51 it's so like it's funny
03:39:53 because like
03:39:55 I only just realized a few days ago
03:39:57 that this means that you have no idea
03:39:59 who Spampton is
03:40:01 you haven't seen Spampton
03:40:03 I am aware of him but I don't really
03:40:07 I don't know him
03:40:09 there was so much
03:40:11 like hype around
03:40:13 all of the stuff in the second chapter
03:40:15 so much content made
03:40:17 and it's like wow
03:40:19 you don't even know that
03:40:21 you know Jevil
03:40:23 I mean I don't know Jevil because I never fought Jevil
03:40:25 oh
03:40:27 so I don't even know that
03:40:29 look at this Delta Rune noob over here
03:40:33 that's a me
03:40:37 you played long enough to see sands and that was it
03:40:41 you know what
03:40:43 maybe I like being a Delta Rune noob
03:40:45 maybe I'm going to internalize it
03:40:47 and make it a part of my personality going forward
03:40:49 maybe I'll be that guy who doesn't know
03:40:51 about Delta Rune
03:40:53 maybe that's my character from now on
03:40:55 oh no
03:40:57 terrible
03:40:59 oh yeah
03:41:01 you're gonna like it
03:41:03 well that's the last voice
03:41:05 that's the last voice now
03:41:07 alright

03:41:39 50 or so bonus episodes
03:41:41 behind the scenes commentary
03:41:43 things like that
03:41:45 also
03:41:47 to be included on the thank you page of the
03:41:49 upcoming perfect comic party
03:41:51 digitally distributed
03:41:55 anthology
03:41:57 um
03:41:59 yeah
03:42:01 yeah and
03:42:03 I guess we just call it a party because it's a
03:42:05 perfect comic party
03:42:07 we can't just call it a party
03:42:09 it doesn't explain what it is
03:42:11 next week's party
03:42:13 next week's party
03:42:15 I mean sure if we
03:42:17 if you could say oh it's weekly jump
03:42:19 people will say oh it's the weekly party
03:42:21 it's the weekly comic party
03:42:23 and we should have
03:42:25 an in group
03:42:27 of regular viewers and we should
03:42:29 refer to them as like
03:42:31 we should come up with a nickname for them
03:42:33 to increase their parasocial engagement with us
03:42:35 we should start every
03:42:37 day partygoers
03:42:39 welcome to the perfect comic party
03:42:41 and hey what about this what if we had
03:42:43 what if we had food at the party
03:42:45 and we themed
03:42:47 and we themed the party the podcast
03:42:49 around that so what if we called
03:42:51 it like the pizza party podcast
03:42:53 what if we did it what if we just
03:42:55 did that
03:42:57 I guess what would happen
03:42:59 what would happen
03:43:01 what was the pizza party podcast
03:43:03 disbanded dissolved
03:43:05 what happened to it
03:43:07 it is not dissolved it was
03:43:09 basically
03:43:11 co-opted by dafpina
03:43:13 and the
03:43:15 previous hosts
03:43:17 dafpina moved in
03:43:19 and basically took over co-hosting
03:43:21 with rebel taxi and they
03:43:23 kicked the old co-hosts out
03:43:25 that seems to be what happened
03:43:27 okay so it's just different
03:43:29 so we can't steal a name
03:43:31 not that we could if they had stopped
03:43:33 we can we can
03:43:37 we can?
03:43:39 what are they gonna do
03:43:41 stop us
03:43:43 I think they're gonna send their millions of
03:43:45 pizza eaters
03:43:47 that's called free
03:43:49 that's called free engagement
03:43:51 they're gonna send their pizza eaters
03:43:53 over to us but we're gonna have
03:43:55 our monks
03:43:57 it'll be pizza eaters
03:43:59 versus party people
03:44:01 and we're gonna have our preachers
03:44:03 who are gonna tell a good word of the pizza party podcast
03:44:05 and they're gonna be converted
03:44:07 turned into loyal subscribers
03:44:09 pizza panners
03:44:11 versus party people
03:44:13 party people
03:44:15 and whoever loses we win
03:44:21 I think
03:44:23 I think that's the strategy going forward
03:44:25 I think the strategy for engagement is just
03:44:27 violate the copyright
03:44:29 of everyone and anyone
03:44:31 of people with bigger audiences than us
03:44:33 and then they'll get mad
03:44:35 and then they'll talk about how mad they are at us
03:44:37 and then their fans will come and listen to our show
03:44:39 then they'll become instant fans
03:44:41 I'm
03:44:43 I think maybe I'm gonna start
03:44:45 going by Daft Pina from now on
03:44:47 I think maybe that's my new name
03:44:51 does that make me rebel taxi
03:44:53 yeah that's what it means
03:44:55 no
03:44:57 no
03:44:59 alright welcome
03:45:01 we'll come back to the next episode
03:45:03 of the pizza party podcast
03:45:05 thanks for listening same pizza time

03:45:21 still our patreon
03:45:23 new name same old patreon
03:45:25 old need for cash
03:45:27 we're gonna reinvent the PCP
03:45:29 at the end of every episode now
03:45:31 yeah
03:45:33 what
03:45:35 it's called iterating
03:45:37 you gotta fail faster
03:45:39 you gotta learn to fail faster
03:45:41 we're gonna try something new every week
03:45:43 every week it's gonna fail and we're gonna learn a lesson
03:45:45 and it's gonna make us strong
03:45:47 we're gonna learn a lesson about friendship
03:45:49 we'll write a little letter it's to Celestia about it
03:45:51 every week
03:45:53 the podcast opens with a new bit
03:45:55 wherein we write like dear princess Celestia
03:45:57 here's why today's exercise
03:45:59 in rebranding the PCP has failed
03:46:01 and what I learned from the experience
03:46:03 and how I'll do better going forward
03:46:07 and that's okay you know what
03:46:09 we'll change like next week to the my little
03:46:11 podcast
03:46:15 then we'll be the
03:46:17 talking pirates

03:46:29 we'll be brad garling house
03:46:31 and then we'll be the dick show
03:46:35 and then the Ralph Rattort
03:46:37 and then we'll be the Ralph Rattort that's right
03:46:39 which keep getting lower and lower
03:46:41 yeah yeah we can find worse and worse
