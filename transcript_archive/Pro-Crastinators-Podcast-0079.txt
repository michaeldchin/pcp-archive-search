00:00:00 All right, two partner, uh, who's on top, who's on bottom?
00:00:06 Lighters are getting the fattest from the bottom.
00:00:12 That's not tough, that's not tough.
00:00:15 All right, and if you had to make an episode about Applebloom going to hell, what would it be?
00:00:19 What would that absolute progression be like?
00:00:21 Would it be like that time Homer went to hell and had to eat all the doughnuts?
00:00:25 I saw our parents applejack!
00:00:29 All right, guys.
00:00:32 Looks like we're all done, guys. We're all done.
00:00:35 They turn off the mic.

00:01:31 Trigger word.
00:01:32 Oh my god! Brody Curious is here!
00:01:35 I even look back! I did it!
00:01:38 I'm alive!
00:01:39 Yay!
00:01:41 Hi.
00:01:42 No longer a zombie.
00:01:43 No, I've been revived.
00:01:45 I'm glad to see everyone survived the whole cutie mark revival.
00:01:47 Have you been max revived?
00:01:50 We've all been max revived.
00:01:53 Yeah, that's right.
00:01:54 We've got the mage pony.
00:01:57 Yeah, Aurora Ignite.
00:02:00 Oh, that's the full name.
00:02:02 I knew that.
00:02:04 I'm a failure.
00:02:06 We've got the munchie with the tiny hats.
00:02:09 I don't know who that guy is, cause let me tell you.
00:02:11 Hey, PCP fans, he's the most recently acquainted best friend, Strawberry Milk.
00:02:17 Yeah!
00:02:20 Woven expertly into the grand tapestry.
00:02:22 That is my little pony, Fringe of Magic Analysis Community.
00:02:25 If you know what I'm saying, real cliff notes on my lore.
00:02:28 I love sex. I'm not like munchie. I love sex. I like the ERP.
00:02:31 I do.
00:02:33 I'm a toon fetishist, and I hate shame, and I hate self-reflection.
00:02:38 I just love sex. That's my character.
00:02:41 Don't wear it out.
00:02:43 We're peas in a pod.
00:02:44 We've even got a brand new friend joining us for the first time.
00:02:48 Our new friend, Tape Stack.
00:02:50 Hey, everybody. I predicted that this would be great.
00:02:56 Do you have tape in your mouth?
00:02:58 I was going to say.
00:03:00 No, I just don't.
00:03:02 I'm racist at all.
00:03:04 Excellent.
00:03:06 You see, we're appealing to all fetishes here.
00:03:08 I'm really into that.
00:03:10 I'm getting ready. I'm getting lewd.
00:03:14 The gang is all here, buddy.
00:03:16 Now, unfortunately, our seafaring buddy, Starboard Bow,
00:03:19 was busy off pirating today, so he couldn't join us,
00:03:21 but we will pour one out in his name.
00:03:24 Gotta get the booty.
00:03:26 Exactly.
00:03:28 Guys, guys, have you seen it? Have you seen it?
00:03:31 Have you seen the long-awaited fucking pony movie?
00:03:36 The cinematic events of all time,
00:03:41 of all the equestrian history.
00:03:43 Guys, let me tell you.
00:03:45 I walked outside one graceful night,
00:03:47 and I looked up in the stars,
00:03:49 and there was the solar eclipse
00:03:51 beaming down directly into my eyes.
00:03:53 And from that day onward, all I could see,
00:03:55 just directly into my red nose,
00:03:57 was the My Little Pony movie on repeat,
00:03:59 as thin as them.
00:04:01 And that's exactly why you should stare at the eclipse.
00:04:03 You know?
00:04:05 Because you get quality semina right in your brain.
00:04:07 You know, I've never really had
00:04:10 a religious experience in a religious place,
00:04:13 but while sitting on my couch,
00:04:15 watching the My Little Pony movie,
00:04:17 I briefly saw God.
00:04:19 Did you, Brony?
00:04:21 It was just wonderful to hear you say that.
00:04:23 I briefly saw God, too. All three of them,
00:04:25 before they were turned to stone.
00:04:27 You mean all four?
00:04:29 You mean all four?
00:04:31 I can see you're rusty out here, Brony Curious,
00:04:34 but let's try and get up to speed, all right?
00:04:36 We're not running a shit show here.
00:04:38 This isn't like some bum-fuck internet pocket.
00:04:40 It's like the PCP.
00:04:42 This is...
00:04:44 It's better.
00:04:46 Get over it, you anti-Hazbright.
00:04:49 This is the PPCP,
00:04:52 the Pony Procrastination Podcast.
00:04:55 It's an alternate reality.
00:04:57 It's the darkest timeline.
00:04:59 Oh, it's the brightest from where I'm standing.
00:05:02 So, okay.
00:05:04 So let's just immediately dive into all the earth-shattering ways
00:05:07 this movie ruined the continuity
00:05:09 of My Little Pony Friends was imagined.
00:05:11 Should we go through it in order to chronologically
00:05:13 like the best internet shows and nostalgia critic?
00:05:16 Okay, hold on.
00:05:18 Let's go to where...
00:05:20 I think it's important because this movie
00:05:22 is so fucking earth-shattering,
00:05:24 and it just plumped us up.
00:05:26 It just plumped us up real good.
00:05:28 It just saddled us up and plumped us down real good.
00:05:30 All right, everybody.
00:05:32 As the creator of the My Little Pony analysis community,
00:05:35 I feel like I could lead this discussion
00:05:38 of the My Little Pony.
00:05:40 Wait, should we talk about our history first,
00:05:42 or is that whatever?
00:05:44 I'm going to talk about our history
00:05:46 and the movie all at once here
00:05:48 because I want to know who else watching this movie.
00:05:51 First of all, actually, more so than our history,
00:05:54 I want to know when was the last time
00:05:56 each of you watched My Little Pony.
00:05:58 I know Hippo follows the show still.
00:06:02 I literally haven't watched a full episode
00:06:05 since I stopped analyzing the show in 2014.
00:06:09 I watched, like, one episode from season 5.
00:06:12 Wait, that's not true. I watched a bunch from season 5.
00:06:14 Wait, Ben, didn't you watch all of season 5
00:06:17 and T-Bap it?
00:06:18 Yeah, we podcasted it.
00:06:19 Wait, you did the whole season 5.
00:06:21 Okay, maybe I'm thinking of season 6 then.
00:06:23 Season 7 is out now, right?
00:06:25 Season 6 is the one that...
00:06:27 Okay, then I stopped watching after the podcast ended,
00:06:30 but I watched, like, one...
00:06:32 I think I watched the finale of the next season
00:06:34 just to see if I was interested.
00:06:36 I keep forgetting I did watch half of season 5
00:06:39 before we went to BronyCon in 2015
00:06:42 just because I wanted to know what the fuck was going on.
00:06:45 I watched a couple episodes, I think, from season 6
00:06:48 because I foolishly made a list
00:06:50 of, like, four episodes I had to review
00:06:52 if big things ever happened,
00:06:54 and then I did some of them because I kept happening.
00:06:56 I got pestered on it on Twitter.
00:06:58 I was like, well, I guess I'll have to talk about them,
00:07:00 so I did.
00:07:02 I stopped watching right around
00:07:04 the midway point of season 5 weekly.
00:07:07 However, me and Phantom here
00:07:09 actually watched a few episodes of season 6 together,
00:07:11 and we should have been basically.
00:07:13 Wait, we did?
00:07:14 Yeah, we did.
00:07:15 Remember when we were going to do a thing, but we never...
00:07:17 Remember when we were going to literally do T-Bap,
00:07:19 but it never happened?
00:07:20 Oh, God, that was, like, forever ago.
00:07:22 Yeah, yeah, okay.
00:07:24 That's when I watched season 6.
00:07:26 What the fuck? I don't remember any of it.
00:07:28 Um, if I recall correctly, you almost cried
00:07:30 in an episode?
00:07:31 What?
00:07:32 Hey, nothing wrong with that.
00:07:33 Which one? Which one?
00:07:34 What the fuck?
00:07:35 The second episode of season 6,
00:07:37 you were like, that's really deep moral,
00:07:39 and I almost cried.
00:07:40 Wait, wait, what happened? Tell me what happened,
00:07:42 because I'm starting to...
00:07:43 Nobody actually cares.
00:07:44 I'm starting to form into memory.
00:07:46 Damn it.
00:07:47 It's like, I should listen to my friends.
00:07:49 What the fuck? No.
00:07:50 That can't be right.
00:07:51 Okay, let's get back to this.
00:07:52 I haven't seen anything since season 5.
00:07:54 Oh, yeah.
00:07:55 Yeah, that was the one where the evil,
00:07:56 where the evil got in her and made her be bad,
00:07:58 and I related to it.
00:07:59 Oh, shit.
00:08:00 God, I forgot.
00:08:01 I forgot this was the best show on the internet.
00:08:04 Mange.
00:08:05 Mange, what was the last time you watched
00:08:06 a new episode of My Little Pony?
00:08:08 Um, I'm actually up to date.
00:08:10 Who?
00:08:11 Oh, shit.
00:08:12 You're up there with hippo.
00:08:13 Number one.
00:08:14 She's a realer pony than any of us.
00:08:16 I'm not actually up to date,
00:08:17 because, um, the pony cast,
00:08:19 we've been having a bit of, like, seasick,
00:08:21 like, cancer, like, what do you call it,
00:08:23 scurvy, I see that.
00:08:25 Sea-sick cancer.
00:08:27 We have some sort of scurvy problem,
00:08:30 so we haven't been able to do any of those episodes
00:08:32 for a while.
00:08:33 So I'm behind on that.
00:08:35 But I, yeah, season 7 is good.
00:08:38 I like season 7.
00:08:40 No, here's the thing with season 7.
00:08:42 If you haven't watched the pony cast,
00:08:44 we discover that season 6 and season 5,
00:08:47 they're like, oh, whatever.
00:08:49 And then season 7,
00:08:50 they start introducing a new main cast,
00:08:54 sort of.
00:08:55 Yeah.
00:08:56 Like, that's, like, that good,
00:08:57 that good-
00:08:58 I have been,
00:08:59 I will say that I have been watching the pony cast,
00:09:01 and that's the only way,
00:09:02 it's been really surreal listening to that podcast,
00:09:05 because I can envision the episodes in my head.
00:09:08 Like, even though it's been so long
00:09:10 since I watched the show,
00:09:11 I spent so much time with it
00:09:12 that I know exactly what it's like.
00:09:14 And so, like, listening to you guys
00:09:16 discuss an episode,
00:09:17 it just brings me right back.
00:09:19 It's like, oh, yeah, this is exactly
00:09:21 what that would have looked like.
00:09:22 And here's what they're talking about.
00:09:24 And I can perfectly envision it.
00:09:26 And that was also what was trippy about this movie,
00:09:29 was that for the first, like, 20 minutes,
00:09:32 it's just an episode of My Little Pony.
00:09:35 Like, if you close your eyes,
00:09:36 because the visuals, you can't.
00:09:38 Like, if you just listen to the way the characters
00:09:40 are talking,
00:09:41 the things they're saying,
00:09:42 the sound effects, the music,
00:09:43 it's just the show.
00:09:46 And then it develops a plot,
00:09:48 and becomes really boring.
00:09:50 What would have been way better
00:09:51 if it looked like an episode of My Little Pony,
00:09:53 because this shit sucks.
00:09:55 God dammit.
00:09:56 Did anyone like the visual aesthetic?
00:09:58 No.
00:09:59 Yeah, man.
00:10:00 I thought it was good.
00:10:01 Oh, really?
00:10:02 It's like, you stood, I quite enjoyed it.
00:10:04 I never stopped.
00:10:06 I mean, it wasn't always terrible,
00:10:08 but there were plenty of moments
00:10:10 that were ruined by the way it was.
00:10:11 Oh, look at their weird big heads
00:10:12 and creepy eyes, though.
00:10:13 Yeah.
00:10:14 That is hard.
00:10:15 Yeah.
00:10:16 My Little Pony's never had big heads
00:10:18 and creepy eyes ever.
00:10:19 It's to the extreme, though.
00:10:20 It's definitely weird.
00:10:21 You'll let that turn up your game
00:10:22 if you want to cut it.
00:10:23 There's too much detail.
00:10:24 My ass.
00:10:25 I totally disagree.
00:10:27 I think the extra frames of animation
00:10:30 are great.
00:10:31 I thought the way that there was
00:10:32 more rendering detail and everything
00:10:34 was great.
00:10:35 My Little Pony's animation was never good.
00:10:36 They all looked like fucking flash puppets
00:10:37 and moved like them the entire show.
00:10:39 They were stilted and awkward.
00:10:40 Right.
00:10:41 And they were never good.
00:10:42 And it was great.
00:10:43 I loved it.
00:10:44 Yeah.
00:10:45 And everyone was saying they looked good
00:10:46 and were wrong.
00:10:47 But this was even worse.
00:10:48 No.
00:10:49 I thought the environments were
00:10:50 particularly really well done.
00:10:51 Here's the background.
00:10:52 The background was fucking good.
00:10:53 Dude, God, I have the perfect analogy.
00:10:54 It's about macaroni and cheese.
00:10:55 You might have macaroni and cheese.
00:10:56 It's made for kids, right?
00:10:57 Oh, God.
00:10:58 Made for fucking kids, right?
00:10:59 But then when you're like a late teen,
00:11:01 you're like, man, I still love
00:11:02 the fucking taste of this.
00:11:03 I could appreciate this fully.
00:11:04 But then once you get into your 20s,
00:11:06 it's getting more like, well,
00:11:07 I still like the taste of it,
00:11:08 but I do like other tastes more.
00:11:09 And also, I feel like cancer after eating it,
00:11:12 like 20 minutes later, I don't know why.
00:11:13 I can't relate to this analogy
00:11:15 because I still eat macaroni nearly every day.
00:11:17 Well, I'm talking specifically about
00:11:18 Kraft, specifically that box, right?
00:11:20 For all of us who aren't actively killing
00:11:22 our bodies and everything.
00:11:23 Right.
00:11:24 Yeah.
00:11:25 So fucking, yeah.
00:11:26 So that's the thing with macaroni and cheese, right?
00:11:27 So the same thing as the MLP aesthetic.
00:11:28 When I was, you know, when it first came out,
00:11:30 I was like, oh my gosh,
00:11:31 it's just so much good animation.
00:11:32 It's like hot colors and fluidity and timing.
00:11:35 But then when I look at it now,
00:11:37 I'm like, okay, I can see all the ones
00:11:38 and zeros in these fucking vectors, you know?
00:11:40 So basically this movie is like someone
00:11:42 handing me a bowl of Kraft macaroni and cheese
00:11:44 with bacon inside.
00:11:45 It's like, well, that's going to be tangy AF.
00:11:47 It's going to make me feel really gross after eating it.
00:11:49 You know?
00:11:50 You know?
00:11:51 It's going to be fucking, it's going to be weird.
00:11:53 But it's going to taste like really intense
00:11:55 and just very childish in that way.
00:11:57 So yeah, it's like people always think,
00:12:00 people always think that good animation
00:12:02 is always going to be better no matter what.
00:12:04 I actually fundamentally disagree with that
00:12:06 because you can't just ramp up the quality of something.
00:12:08 Like the fight scenes in this, particularly the one
00:12:10 where Tempest beats the shit out of like a random mook
00:12:12 in like that city.
00:12:13 I thought that looked absolutely beautiful
00:12:15 and I was like, now that's something that like
00:12:17 just enhances the quality of this thing in general.
00:12:20 Perfectly balanced.
00:12:21 That specifically sucked.
00:12:23 No, that specifically was good.
00:12:25 It was like the best part.
00:12:26 But you can't over-animate
00:12:30 just the scenes of people talking
00:12:32 and like looking at each other dramatically
00:12:34 actually makes it more boring and worse
00:12:36 because things take longer to do
00:12:38 and it drives things out.
00:12:40 Yeah, I completely disagree.
00:12:41 I think you guys...
00:12:42 Kill and kill is an inventive animation.
00:12:44 No, no, no.
00:12:45 You guys are two, you're two attached
00:12:47 to the style you've known forever.
00:12:49 No, I hate the style I've known forever.
00:12:54 I gotta say, yeah, one of the hardest things
00:12:56 about trying to go back and watch my little pony for me
00:12:58 is that the animation is dog shit in the show
00:13:01 and like every, I don't know how we...
00:13:03 This is the guy who watches anime.
00:13:05 I think we all somehow...
00:13:07 Like when you get into MLP
00:13:09 then it's like in the fan community
00:13:11 every unique facial expression
00:13:13 that gets introduced is a big deal
00:13:15 because the show by and large is just the same
00:13:17 stock shit over and over again.
00:13:19 As soon as you see like one face of new
00:13:21 everyone freaks out.
00:13:23 But when you go back and watch the show
00:13:25 like when you're not in the hype cycle
00:13:27 and you just look at it, you're like,
00:13:29 oh yeah, it looks like shit.
00:13:31 This movie to me felt like
00:13:34 lipstick on a pig.
00:13:39 I enjoyed the aesthetic
00:13:40 because I went into it with the right mindset.
00:13:42 Now you see the reason why I stopped watching MLP
00:13:44 right around season five
00:13:46 since I never got to answer that question
00:13:47 since everyone seems to always
00:13:48 fucking ignore me when we go round about.
00:13:50 I'll get over it later.
00:13:52 Anyway, I have a fucking pillow to yell at
00:13:54 so I'm fine anyway.
00:13:56 So after getting out of MLP
00:13:58 I discovered this thing called,
00:14:00 I don't know if you've heard of it, anime, right?
00:14:02 Now that's where like you have stuff that like
00:14:04 there's this one show called
00:14:05 Kill Law Kills Inventive Animation
00:14:07 and that's a really good aesthetic.
00:14:11 And then there's like this other show
00:14:13 called like the incredible pacing
00:14:15 and visual imagery of Sound God's To No Lion
00:14:17 by Super Eye Patch Wolf, the son.
00:14:19 That's a good anime I like as well.
00:14:21 With incredibly well timed imagery
00:14:23 I've had so much incredible aesthetic.
00:14:25 It's like how much more exciting
00:14:27 can a show be than Kill Law Kills Inventive Animation?
00:14:29 How much more fucking well
00:14:31 directed can a show be other than
00:14:33 Sound God's To No Lion by Super Eye Patch Wolf?
00:14:35 Like you can't have anything better than that.
00:14:37 So it really is like someone saying
00:14:39 hey man you want to eat some macaroni and cheese
00:14:41 with fucking bacon bits and maybe someone
00:14:43 will put some soy sauce on it.
00:14:45 You really, really milk in this analogy.
00:14:47 Yeah, well I love food analogies.
00:14:49 I'm not sure if I buy into it completely.
00:14:51 Who does love milk?
00:14:53 What the fuck is the boo?
00:14:55 What the fuck is the boo?
00:14:57 The name is Tape Stack.
00:14:59 It's a set deck because that was somebody else's
00:15:01 Pony Osea and it's similar enough that it's
00:15:03 fucking out of my head.
00:15:05 I hope you guys understand what this podcast is going to be.
00:15:07 It's just going to be like eight people talking
00:15:09 all over each other all at once and then
00:15:11 long stretches of just DeVoo talking only.
00:15:13 So just another episode of the PCP.
00:15:15 I want to speak about
00:15:17 the artwork.
00:15:19 The animation.
00:15:21 Do it. You're the one with the most animation
00:15:23 knowledge.
00:15:25 You're a regular Bugs Bunny ancient.
00:15:27 Cowboy.
00:15:29 I'm going to plump you up real hard
00:15:31 and spread my necklace across your lip
00:15:33 in the second you're spread.
00:15:35 Oh my god.
00:15:37 Go on.
00:15:39 What the fuck, Strawberry?
00:15:41 Simmer down.
00:15:45 It's okay. He loves sex. I understand.
00:15:51 I came into this
00:15:53 seeing because I saw the trailer and it looked weird.
00:15:55 The pinkie was like
00:15:57 she's falling and her nose looked like
00:15:59 a weird pig nose and didn't look right.
00:16:01 Weren't caught in the movie.
00:16:03 The thing is
00:16:05 the trailer shows all the worst bits
00:16:07 because it just
00:16:09 Anyway
00:16:11 I thought
00:16:13 I would hate it because it was kind of weird
00:16:15 but I also noticed
00:16:17 it's like they're doing a Disney thing
00:16:19 with the pony thing
00:16:21 and I just sort of got used to it
00:16:23 and then I started to like it.
00:16:25 I started to like the extra frames.
00:16:27 I really liked all the moments where Tempest
00:16:29 was looking down at the camera
00:16:31 and she was the best animated
00:16:33 character in the whole movie.
00:16:35 She was good.
00:16:37 In the new art style, yeah.
00:16:39 Tempest was the best.
00:16:41 She was designed for it.
00:16:43 It's like Joachim's adventure.
00:16:47 What made?
00:16:49 Everyone shut the fuck up.
00:16:51 And everything on the water was great.
00:16:53 Yeah.
00:16:55 The new animation
00:16:57 really suited Tempest the most, I think.
00:16:59 All the rest
00:17:01 were kind of like
00:17:03 like I said, I got used to it eventually
00:17:05 but they all were very sort of like
00:17:07 still squishy and sort of
00:17:09 soft looking.
00:17:11 It's always been that way but yeah, definitely to a larger degree.
00:17:13 And you know how much I love soft looking things.
00:17:15 I think the problem is that
00:17:17 the MLP animation has always
00:17:19 had a really difficult time
00:17:21 dealing with extreme foreshortens
00:17:23 poses, like even in the regular show.
00:17:25 It's always like the thing, one of my
00:17:27 little pet peeves of the animation style
00:17:29 which persists in this animation swap
00:17:31 is that whenever you look at a regular
00:17:33 design pony from straight on, the muzzle
00:17:35 is never done correctly in perspective.
00:17:37 It just looks like someone slapped a shape on top
00:17:39 of a flat face and that's why when you get
00:17:41 that perspective shot with Pinky, it looks all fucked up
00:17:43 because I don't know how to draw that
00:17:45 from not a three fourths or profile view
00:17:47 it works even less well
00:17:49 in this more detailed style.
00:17:51 The point of the aesthetic is to add cinematic
00:17:53 to the MLP viewer.
00:17:55 That's exactly right.
00:17:57 It's often derided by being overused
00:17:59 but in this context it's, hey
00:18:01 TV show that looks really good
00:18:03 by its own standards, that's been going on for seven seasons.
00:18:05 Here, here's a cinematic version
00:18:07 because it's an exciting way to deliver
00:18:09 a little tight.
00:18:11 It's definitely hype to see it
00:18:13 that way. The problem is that I don't think
00:18:15 the character designs translate well to it.
00:18:17 When you see the characters
00:18:19 in three fourths faces
00:18:21 when you see that other eye
00:18:23 on the other side of their face
00:18:25 that just looks fucked up to me.
00:18:27 Some of the characters work better than others.
00:18:29 Twilight talking
00:18:31 to the princesses in the beginning
00:18:33 and I was just looking at her eyes
00:18:35 like why are they wrong?
00:18:37 And they also added detail to the eyes
00:18:39 like anime style.
00:18:41 The way that they made the shines
00:18:43 translucent.
00:18:45 That was the biggest problem for me.
00:18:47 Although I didn't like the detail in the irises
00:18:49 like how the irises are all speckled and stuff.
00:18:51 Yeah, I was cool.
00:18:53 I was never part of this whole analysis community.
00:18:55 Was this what it was like?
00:18:57 It's weird that none of the other characters have it.
00:18:59 How did you last it?
00:19:01 Just the main ponies have that.
00:19:03 I think
00:19:05 my impression of the animation
00:19:07 and of everything in the movie
00:19:09 was a constant series of
00:19:11 slugged.
00:19:13 You'd see sometimes
00:19:15 there would be a piece of animation
00:19:17 that's like, yeah, okay, that worked.
00:19:19 Or a joke.
00:19:21 I think Twilight showing
00:19:23 Celestia and Luna like the angles
00:19:25 she wants them to put the sun and the moon at the beginning.
00:19:27 I was like, yeah, okay, that's a good Twilight joke.
00:19:29 That's something she do and say.
00:19:31 The ghost in this movie
00:19:33 felt so fucking flat.
00:19:35 I can't even believe that.
00:19:37 Mage, mage, mage, mage, mage, mage.
00:19:39 Everyone shut up.
00:19:41 I don't understand why the princesses
00:19:43 didn't want to go with that plan because
00:19:45 why?
00:19:47 It's not much effort to do that
00:19:49 because when later the guy gets the staff
00:19:51 he just plays around with the sun and the moon
00:19:53 like it's nuts.
00:19:55 He's like, I have a great idea
00:19:57 for something you can do
00:19:59 and they're like, that is a great idea
00:20:01 and we totally could do it, but we won't.
00:20:03 Good luck.
00:20:05 The princesses have to stay in character
00:20:07 useless.
00:20:09 If they actually did something productive
00:20:11 I would have been totally unsold.
00:20:13 I am mighty and better than you.
00:20:15 I have something to say
00:20:17 when
00:20:19 Twilight's like, hey, I need this utility
00:20:21 so the concert will be cool.
00:20:23 They're like, we believe in you.
00:20:25 Don't worry, you're a princess too.
00:20:27 I'm sure you can do it.
00:20:29 I'm sure you can do it and she's like,
00:20:31 no, this is what I want to do.
00:20:33 You put me in charge and this is what I fucking want.
00:20:35 You're supposed to be able to do that.
00:20:37 I think the idea is that they're saying
00:20:39 we can't just fuck up the day-night cycle
00:20:41 of the world for one party.
00:20:43 There's other consequences of doing that.
00:20:45 I think they just don't understand math
00:20:47 and they were saving face.
00:20:49 But the Storm King does that later.
00:20:51 The Storm King fucks it up later and no, it's fine.
00:20:53 Everyone's fine.
00:20:55 Guys.
00:20:57 Guys though,
00:20:59 Twilight said that it was about the time
00:21:01 when the sun is supposed to be setting
00:21:03 and the moon was probably going to be rising
00:21:05 at around the same time, so all they had to do
00:21:07 was just hold it for a little bit
00:21:09 in the same place. Nothing was going to get fucked up.
00:21:11 That will fuck up people
00:21:13 who are looking at the sun and they're like,
00:21:15 why is the sun no here?
00:21:17 Some port sailor on the sea
00:21:19 is going to lose his way
00:21:21 because they're like a minute.
00:21:23 They know that the sun and moon are reliable.
00:21:25 You stop and ballot out there
00:21:27 right now.
00:21:29 We have to think of him.
00:21:31 That's how it is.
00:21:33 Phantom Horde.
00:21:37 The sun and moon
00:21:39 they're not just
00:21:41 over Equestria.
00:21:43 It's like the whole world's sun and moon.
00:21:45 I was thinking about this
00:21:47 the very day, when Celestia and Luna
00:21:49 fuck with the sun and the moon, is that just an Equestria thing?
00:21:51 Because only the ponies do that
00:21:53 It's like how America
00:21:55 is the world police.
00:21:57 These guys are the world sun
00:21:59 Like when the Sun and the Moon get fucked up are like the fucking cat people and like parrot people and like the hydro ponies and whatever
00:22:06 Are they all like, oh, I guess I guess the ponies are having a fucking war again
00:22:10 Equestria is like the America to that world where like all the third world countries get fucked every time we do something
00:22:18 The point I was trying to make simply is that if they hold the Sun and Moon in place it will fuck up for everybody in the world
00:22:24 And this is just for a party that's just
00:22:30 The Sun and Moon could be contextual, you know, it's like in Dark Souls now, since it's 2013 again
00:22:35 You might not know about the game called Dark Souls where the Sun is different in certain places
00:22:39 So just saying, it's an establishable concept
00:22:42 No, if it's 2013, then Dark Souls is exactly what we're talking about
00:22:46 I know what the Sun and Moon theory, the Flat Earth theory, this totally makes sense
00:22:54 Because they just go in circles, they move in circles around this, yeah, that totally works
00:22:59 Fucking crazy, get off the dark part of YouTube
00:23:03 All the new Pokemon they added were hard to get and I couldn't find them anywhere, they just had such a low percent rate
00:23:09 I just couldn't find any of them
00:23:11 You're missing the force through the trees, the point is that the animation, they all look chubby and scary, like vaguely like meaty
00:23:19 Like they have flesh, they eat their dumb, plump up cheeks, I just want to plump them up real high
00:23:24 I just want to lift up their stomachs real quick, real fast, real good, and just feel those shells
00:23:30 You're entirely correct, and that stems from a larger, I would call it a problem
00:23:35 And it's exactly what Davoo is saying
00:23:37 Who the fuck is this person you keep comparing to?
00:23:39 I'm sorry, a tape stack, my old companion in his beloved braces
00:23:44 He's a new companion, you fucking retard
00:23:47 Son
00:23:48 Yeah, exactly
00:23:50 So I'm looking right now at a screenshot of the princesses at the beginning
00:23:54 And they look normal and good
00:23:56 And then I go like one frame over to Twilight and then she looks all fucked up and weird
00:24:00 And that's the problem with this movie
00:24:03 It's everything that is involved with turning a cartoon into a movie I always hate and it's never been done right
00:24:09 It's like I said, the style sort of fits Tempest and she has sort of the same facial features as the princesses
00:24:15 It's that nose shape, you can't have the little bubbly nose because it doesn't work
00:24:19 It's not just the character designs either, this spills over into the narrative
00:24:23 Where A, they have to baby us by teaching us what all the characters do every time
00:24:28 Do
00:24:30 The beginning of the movie was just like, hey Rarity, you like fashion, right?
00:24:35 Sure do, bud, sure do
00:24:38 I knew who was going to do that shit
00:24:40 That seemed acceptable
00:24:42 I like how they established it's like X-Rarity even though that's completely irrelevant to them
00:24:46 I got it so irrelevant to the movie
00:24:48 The thing is, I don't think it was about babying us
00:24:52 This movie just contains every piece of information about my little pony in it
00:24:57 It's the people who haven't seen it before can just watch the movie, of course
00:25:00 Not even that, not even that, I don't think that's what they were going for
00:25:03 I think it's for fan service, I think it's so that everything they could possibly make
00:25:08 Every background pony is in just the opening scene
00:25:11 Every single named one, everybody makes an appearance
00:25:15 Every callback imaginable is made
00:25:18 I was actually distracted by that
00:25:22 To people who don't know
00:25:26 There's the end of the movie, everyone's having a good time
00:25:29 And then both biceps just shows up and no one who watches the show goes like, what the fuck is that?
00:25:33 No play
00:25:34 Why is that?
00:25:35 He was in the movie though, he was in the movie a number of times
00:25:38 Yeah, but that's my only point, it doesn't make sense that he was just a joke
00:25:43 I mean, no play didn't make sense to begin with
00:25:46 He was just a random sight gang
00:25:48 I was really distracted by Rainbow Dash saying three seconds flat, Fluttershy saying
00:25:53 Oh my god, when Fluttershy said two times
00:25:57 Yeah, when he said it's the first time I rolled my eyes
00:25:59 When he said it's the second time I literally hung myself
00:26:03 Alright, the worst thing about this movie, I don't know the worst thing
00:26:07 But one of the things I didn't like was the fact that most of the main six they got something to do
00:26:12 They either had a song or they were somehow helpful
00:26:15 Fluttershy said yay twice and did absolutely nothing
00:26:18 Just like the regular show, she was in character
00:26:22 I made an itemized list, I analyzed
00:26:25 We're going right back
00:26:27 What's up with this fucking cheesy Gornita Crunch is doing her shit
00:26:32 Well, there it is
00:26:34 Listen, I analyzed this film with a fine tooth microscope
00:26:38 And I determined scientifically that there were, of the main crew
00:26:42 There were a full three characters who did literally nothing in the entire movie
00:26:47 And it was Fluttershy, Rarity and Applejack
00:26:50 What about Rainbow Dash, what did she do?
00:26:53 I want to talk about Rainbow Dash
00:26:56 I want to talk about everything, that's what Rainbow Dash did
00:26:59 She is in fact a regular show
00:27:01 Okay, guys, okay, okay
00:27:03 This falls into the mean category
00:27:05 What I want to know, I called the police, called the mayor, called the president
00:27:10 What was with the weird insertion of the Sonic Rain Boom
00:27:13 The Sonic Rain Boom was never like a means
00:27:15 It was a band service, it was totally a band service
00:27:17 It was totally a band service
00:27:19 She just wanted to do it
00:27:21 It was really weird that she was so adamant about it throughout the movie
00:27:25 She keeps bringing it up, and I was like, why, she's not like that
00:27:29 Okay, wait, I've got it
00:27:30 In canon explanation, Rainbow is meeting a bunch of new friends
00:27:33 She's in a new place, she wants them to see
00:27:35 She wants them to see her cool things she can do with the rainbow
00:27:38 That's why she wanted to
00:27:40 That was in season one, it was so long ago
00:27:42 And you're like, gay was in season one too
00:27:44 Speaking of Rainbow
00:27:45 It was like beginning of the show memes
00:27:47 What's the deal, bro, what's up?
00:27:49 Entry level, basic bitch shit
00:27:51 Speaking of basic bitch shit
00:27:53 Did Rainbow really need another song about awesome?
00:27:57 I'm getting second verse
00:27:59 That song is literally, that song is my least favorite part
00:28:02 And I'll tell you why
00:28:03 Because when the pirates were being like, wait a minute
00:28:06 Let's cast off the yoke of the man and rediscover our true selves
00:28:09 I like the design of the pirates
00:28:12 And I really wanted to get excited for that part
00:28:14 Like I could feel myself almost enjoying myself
00:28:17 But then the song came on
00:28:19 And the song, it's time to be awesome
00:28:21 And I hated it
00:28:22 I hated the song so much that it ruined the moment
00:28:25 I was really hoping that they'd have this big song
00:28:28 No, because the whole reason they said
00:28:29 She's trying to get them to sing the songs
00:28:31 I don't want to get kicked off the ship
00:28:33 And I was really hoping they'd have this big moment of them being
00:28:35 Yeah, we're pirates
00:28:36 And then they fucking made them walk the plank anyway
00:28:38 Because they're pirates
00:28:39 Yeah, that's what I was thinking too
00:28:40 We've all been doing the opinions of this movie
00:28:42 It's just backwards
00:28:43 Here's what you do with a movie like this
00:28:45 You cooperate with it and reduce a point
00:28:47 In exchange for your cooperation
00:28:49 So as soon as the movie begins
00:28:51 I promise I won't have any food analogies
00:28:53 The movie begins to a parody of an 80's song
00:28:55 With a pony's lyrics inside
00:28:57 Wait, are you doing a mysterious Mr. Enter right here?
00:28:59 Is that what's going on?
00:29:01 Or are you being legitimate?
00:29:03 I thought you were memeing for a second
00:29:05 Well, I don't know, you tell me
00:29:07 Because mysterious Mr. Enter's thing
00:29:09 Is that he would start each episode with five points
00:29:12 And he would reduce or add them based on
00:29:14 Whether or not something good or bad
00:29:16 See, I never watched stupid videos
00:29:18 That is how I start my videos, they're great
00:29:20 I went into it assuming it was going to be bad
00:29:22 And then pretty early on I'm like
00:29:24 Wait, I wanted to talk more about the pirate
00:29:26 I want to say two things too
00:29:28 We have to get organized here
00:29:30 We've got to get organized here
00:29:32 Everyone was like
00:29:34 Everyone has to be in this episode
00:29:36 It's got to be the whole crew
00:29:38 This is good, this is what the people want
00:29:40 If we just analyze the fact for a second
00:29:42 That this podcast will mean
00:29:44 Literally nothing to like
00:29:46 80% of our audience
00:29:48 I don't give a shit, I want that
00:29:50 I want them to f-
00:29:52 If they don't know Peg, if they don't know Digi
00:29:54 If they don't know Phantom, if they don't know
00:29:56 Give them they don't know anything
00:29:58 The real point, the entire conceit of the PCP
00:30:00 I never told any of this
00:30:02 The whole point of it was to get people into
00:30:04 My little pony, 80 episodes of this shit
00:30:06 This is what it's all been for
00:30:08 I'm talking about of the PCP
00:30:10 This is like 80 episodes now or something
00:30:12 You fucking idiot
00:30:14 I tricked you
00:30:16 You're a brony now
00:30:18 Look down at yourself, that's the body of a brony
00:30:20 You fool
00:30:22 And what a body it is
00:30:24 While we're off topic, I want to
00:30:26 Pause it a backstory for
00:30:28 TapeStack, if that's okay
00:30:30 Here's a suggestion to be
00:30:32 The backstory of TapeStack
00:30:34 TapeStack is a huge
00:30:36 MLP analysis fan
00:30:38 Who has all of our stuff on Tape
00:30:40 He had everybody's analysis
00:30:42 On video
00:30:44 And he had like this huge collection
00:30:46 He put his VHS tape into YouTube
00:30:48 And recorded it
00:30:50 And then there was like a brony con going on
00:30:52 And he met all of us and was hanging out with the
00:30:54 With the group and he showed us his tape collection
00:30:56 We were really impressed and we wanted to be friends
00:30:58 And that's how we met TapeStack
00:31:00 So brony con is now canon to the
00:31:02 My little pony universe
00:31:04 I think though
00:31:06 Wasn't there actually a brony convention
00:31:08 In the show
00:31:10 Wasn't there actually a brony convention
00:31:12 In the show where Patton Oswald was there
00:31:14 Or something
00:31:16 That did happen
00:31:18 And they just made fun of the entire fandom
00:31:20 That is a real thing
00:31:22 I want to complain about the pirates some more
00:31:24 Because they made me really mad
00:31:26 I do want to make two points as well
00:31:28 You can go first and then I'll go
00:31:30 Okay first point
00:31:32 Alright everyone knows what a pirate is
00:31:34 And what a pirate does
00:31:36 Why would they think it's awesome and want them to continue to be pirates
00:31:38 That's stupid
00:31:40 Well I have an answer to that
00:31:42 It's because they're not actually pirates
00:31:44 When they describe their job as pirates
00:31:46 They say they're treasure hunters
00:31:48 They do not actually engage in piracy
00:31:50 The entire pirate conceit is fucking retarded
00:31:52 Because we get to the scene
00:31:54 And it's like oh we're being
00:31:56 Impressed by the Storm King
00:31:58 And she's like oh be pirates again
00:32:00 Does Storm King just do to them again
00:32:02 Whatever he did to subjugate them
00:32:04 Oh my fucking god
00:32:06 My first problem
00:32:08 How is that not immediately what you thought
00:32:10 When this scene came
00:32:12 Because that was all I thought
00:32:14 This makes no fucking sense
00:32:16 This is the least sense making thing I've ever seen
00:32:18 I was fine with Rainbow Dash
00:32:20 That was the moment the movie was dead for me
00:32:22 I was fine with Rainbow Dash convincing them to be pirates again
00:32:24 But then when Tempest showed up I was like
00:32:26 Oh okay she's gonna see that they've gone back to the pirate
00:32:28 And they're gonna get in trouble with the Storm King
00:32:30 No Tempest sees
00:32:32 That they've fucking thrown off their duties
00:32:34 And they've gone back to them and she doesn't even care
00:32:36 She doesn't do anything
00:32:38 The most cleverly written scene in the movie
00:32:40 Where it's like suddenly lunch
00:32:42 It's a funny subversion
00:32:44 It's a funny subversion of your expectations
00:32:46 It's a cruel way of establishing some world building
00:32:48 About how the fucking guy
00:32:50 Has been taking over the whole universe
00:32:52 Basic shit
00:32:54 You just get to know about their characters
00:32:56 And you empathize with them
00:32:58 And then someone goes
00:33:00 Hey, stand up for yourself
00:33:02 Stop being afraid
00:33:04 But apparently that makes no sense
00:33:06 People never have a point where they turn around
00:33:08 To realize they stand up for themselves
00:33:10 They never found that
00:33:12 So that's fine as they did
00:33:14 But there should have been consequences
00:33:16 If there were no consequences for them
00:33:18 Going back to being pirates
00:33:20 Then why did they start being different
00:33:22 They literally were just scared
00:33:24 They were totally consequential
00:33:26 No, they didn't
00:33:28 That's not because they went back to being pirates
00:33:30 It's because they were harboring prisoners
00:33:32 They didn't realize they didn't swap their costumes
00:33:34 They didn't realize they didn't swap their costumes
00:33:36 They were standing right fucking there
00:33:38 What the fuck
00:33:40 That was a stupid thing
00:33:42 They should have immediately put their costumes back on
00:33:44 I would agree with that
00:33:46 I have to say something
00:33:48 I have to
00:33:50 Please give him please
00:33:52 Rainbow Dash was like
00:33:54 Hey, you guys should be pirates
00:33:56 But not because she's a good friend
00:33:58 Here's the headcan reason why
00:34:00 It's because she knows that she just wants to trick them
00:34:02 So she doesn't die
00:34:04 And then it's like
00:34:06 You guys should be pirates and they're like
00:34:08 There's no apprehension or anything
00:34:10 It's just like please be pirates again
00:34:12 Please
00:34:14 As Ben touched on
00:34:16 I thought that the point of the scene
00:34:18 Was going to be that the pirates were stupid
00:34:20 That like they were going to have this whole
00:34:22 Up like they're going to reform everything
00:34:24 And then the ponies after having
00:34:26 Like reformed the pirates were just going to
00:34:28 Skate or get like brought to somewhere else
00:34:30 And then the bad guys were going to show up and immediately
00:34:32 Subjugate the pirates again they're going to be like
00:34:34 Oh right of course how could we forget
00:34:36 That we are under the rule of the storm king
00:34:38 And we can't actually just rise up out of nowhere
00:34:40 Because he's more powerful than us
00:34:42 But like no
00:34:44 They just are characters now
00:34:46 And more than that like pirates
00:34:48 Are not necessarily good people
00:34:50 They really should
00:34:52 The whole thing of them doing the awesome song
00:34:54 Was completely out of self interest
00:34:56 That's why I say this script
00:34:58 That's why I say this goddamn script was
00:35:00 Babyfied there's this idea that like
00:35:02 Pirates are just like cool guys
00:35:04 The show is for babies
00:35:06 Dude you spent years talking about the show
00:35:08 It is not
00:35:10 You need to say something
00:35:12 Alright
00:35:14 You guys are all wrong in every aspect
00:35:16 You're not thinking
00:35:18 Let me explain to you what my little pony is
00:35:20 It is
00:35:22 A show
00:35:24 That's alright
00:35:26 But it has occasional flashes of
00:35:28 Oh that's nice
00:35:30 It's a show that's
00:35:32 Whatever and it's got a few little nuggets of
00:35:34 Cool shit
00:35:36 People noticed that there was cool shit
00:35:38 In a show about ponies and they thought
00:35:40 Wow that's really unexpected
00:35:42 And they formed a community around it
00:35:44 Everybody started analyzing it
00:35:46 And everyone's a stupid idiot
00:35:48 Pirates are cool
00:35:50 Airships are cool
00:35:52 I liked it
00:35:54 The whole movie was great and I can't believe
00:35:56 The continuity errors god damn
00:35:58 The continuity errors
00:36:00 I want to explain how I watched this movie
00:36:02 Because I did not go into this
00:36:04 Like
00:36:06 I think some mothers did
00:36:08 I went into this movie
00:36:10 I heard it was bad from Ben and Jackie
00:36:12 Or Phantom and
00:36:14 What was her equity
00:36:16 That's a genius name by the way
00:36:18 Let me quickly
00:36:20 Touch on the fact that walking into the theater
00:36:22 She was talking about her theater
00:36:24 At which theater soon
00:36:26 It's important to me
00:36:28 She got accosted by some guy in a pony shirt
00:36:30 Who was like
00:36:32 And right then the tone
00:36:34 Was bad for the theater
00:36:36 So a man asked her a question
00:36:38 And she was deeply offended
00:36:40 He was waiting around in the lobby
00:36:42 And I got the feeling
00:36:44 That he was waiting around to meet
00:36:46 His fellow bronies
00:36:48 And then he spotted too right before
00:36:50 But he knew it was time
00:36:52 His dar was on
00:36:54 Gibbon you liking something big
00:36:56 Big mistake
00:36:58 You're gonna get knocked into some pins
00:37:00 Come up your location about 5-10 minutes
00:37:02 Gonna knock you right down
00:37:04 Really soon
00:37:06 What we were talking about
00:37:08 Did you want to share your experience
00:37:10 Okay, okay, okay
00:37:12 Quiet the rails into like
00:37:14 Random nothing
00:37:16 Okay, okay, I have a story
00:37:18 I showed up to the theater with my posse
00:37:20 Of insane clowns
00:37:22 I just want to flip, I just want to flip so hard
00:37:24 Employees get sweaty, I just want to get plumped up
00:37:26 I'm gonna rough these guys around a bit
00:37:28 I'm gonna slap their lip a few times
00:37:30 And so
00:37:32 I order some pretzel bites
00:37:34 And I assume they're pre-cooked
00:37:36 Like anus wasters
00:37:38 But like I order them
00:37:40 What the fuck
00:37:42 And so
00:37:48 So I order them and the cashiers
00:37:50 Like alright you're just gonna come out real soon
00:37:52 And I'm like at the naive fool I am
00:37:54 I say like okay, I go wait by that side of the corner
00:37:56 With my friend Kyle, I talk about this couple for
00:37:58 Fuck you Kyle, he immediately starts
00:38:00 Jeering me most rudely
00:38:02 With his gnarled fangs and his angular
00:38:04 Visage and he's just eating
00:38:06 So we're gonna be late, I tell him please don't be mean
00:38:08 I'm just gonna be slapping around here
00:38:10 Real soon, right quick right now
00:38:12 The demon persists the clocks
00:38:14 To get down the minutes right before the movie
00:38:16 Get shorter and shorter, his flamboyantly hostile
00:38:18 Demeter rocks the very coal in my spine
00:38:20 He's like a furry freaky friend
00:38:22 But only worse and gay
00:38:24 Anyway I get the pretzels and
00:38:26 We weren't late for the movie but we were really close
00:38:28 Fuck you Kyle, stop being mean to me
00:38:30 And they were like
00:38:32 Yeah, there's a lot of bronies and stuff
00:38:34 I also got
00:38:36 I also got
00:38:38 My first movie
00:38:40 My little pony certificate, they had like these like
00:38:42 Certificates you could get out
00:38:44 What the fuck
00:38:46 Like all the five year olds who come to the movie
00:38:48 Like ready to get their cinema cherry popped
00:38:50 And I got the certificate
00:38:52 Is that like a Mew?
00:38:54 Write down your pony name, write down your pony name
00:38:56 Write down your date of birth and like day to day
00:38:58 And your movie theater like place
00:39:00 Is that like the promotional Mew cards
00:39:02 That you got at Pokemon?
00:39:04 It all ties together
00:39:06 The history repeats itself
00:39:08 The purpose was to like
00:39:10 Write down their first movie experience
00:39:12 But like everyone took them or just like 19 to 26 year old guys
00:39:14 And they just always wrote down
00:39:16 That this was their first movie they've ever seen
00:39:18 Wow
00:39:20 Awesome
00:39:22 So the reason I wanted to bring up my viewing experience
00:39:24 I had already heard from Phantom Inequity
00:39:26 That the movie was supposed to be really bad
00:39:28 I thought it looked really bad
00:39:30 So I was like I'm going to get drunk and watch this movie
00:39:32 And I didn't want to go out and pay for it
00:39:34 I was really resistant to being on this podcast
00:39:36 Because I didn't want to have to pay for the movie
00:39:38 We left you no alternative
00:39:40 But then the greatest bro in the world
00:39:42 Keg Standard
00:39:44 As he would typically do
00:39:46 Found an illegal download of the movie for me
00:39:48 That's right
00:39:50 So here's the thing
00:39:52 I watched this with my girlfriend
00:39:54 Who has never watched my little pony
00:39:56 She seemed like maybe two episodes of the original show
00:39:58 And completely avoided it
00:40:00 I thought it was like I don't want to be a part of this thing
00:40:02 This song
00:40:04 She recognized
00:40:06 All the autistic people she knew were into this show
00:40:08 So she paid a little bit
00:40:10 Such a significant other
00:40:12 Did you bro?
00:40:14 So
00:40:16 I went into this movie
00:40:18 With a weird mixed feeling
00:40:20 Because on the one hand I was expecting it to be bad
00:40:22 And I was drinking
00:40:24 We were both drunk when we watched it
00:40:26 But I also really
00:40:28 Wanted it to be good
00:40:30 Because I want to convince her
00:40:32 That I'm not a fucking
00:40:34 You're reminding me of my little pony
00:40:36 So
00:40:38 This is the wrong vehicle for that
00:40:40 In many ways
00:40:42 The early part of the movie
00:40:44 Was actually good
00:40:46 I liked the first 20 minutes
00:40:48 Because I thought it represented
00:40:50 What is good about the character interactions
00:40:52 In the show pretty well
00:40:54 Oh you're a fucking
00:40:56 I'm gonna knock you down
00:40:58 Lots of lines that immediately
00:41:00 Get to the heart of what's good
00:41:02 You get that Twilight's over
00:41:04 She's overbearing
00:41:06 She tries to prepare way too hard
00:41:08 You see the endearing qualities
00:41:10 Of Twilight in that early part of the movie
00:41:12 That was just to check off her character
00:41:14 Like oh she likes that
00:41:16 I agree
00:41:18 It was just checking off a list
00:41:20 You're watching if someone who's never seen
00:41:22 My little pony before is watching this movie
00:41:24 And you're checking off a list of all the
00:41:26 Best character traits of the characters
00:41:28 It's a good place to be
00:41:30 She was laughing at the jokes
00:41:32 And thinking
00:41:34 Things that are good about this
00:41:36 Yes see
00:41:38 Every time something would happen
00:41:40 That was indicative of something
00:41:42 I would explain it
00:41:44 Oh yeah Fluttershy is like this
00:41:46 Oh god you mansplained the entire movie
00:41:48 That's disgusting
00:41:50 Well the entire movie
00:41:52 Because then we got to the point where
00:41:54 They start introducing the plot
00:41:56 And it immediately starts going downhill
00:41:58 And I start explaining
00:42:00 Oh yeah well you know
00:42:02 Every time they would do a two-parter episode
00:42:04 And they'd introduce a villain
00:42:06 Those are always shitty episodes
00:42:08 Because it's not really like the shows about
00:42:10 And it's like
00:42:12 The movie was just like an adventure season finale
00:42:14 With all the problems
00:42:16 Exactly
00:42:18 How many times have we all railed against
00:42:20 Those specific episodes
00:42:22 Oh look at all these backgrounds
00:42:24 Look at all these side characters that have nothing to do
00:42:26 Here we go again
00:42:28 Not just MLP, any show in the universe right
00:42:30 What is the worst episode of any show
00:42:32 The episode that you try to show
00:42:34 To a new person that's a friend of yours
00:42:36 Who's not seen it before
00:42:38 Always going to be a fucking dumpster fire
00:42:40 Unless you calculate which episode
00:42:42 If it's a random episode
00:42:44 It's the worst episode
00:42:46 Right but it's just like episode one
00:42:48 To show it to a friend
00:42:50 The problem with the Nightmare Mooner
00:42:52 I smile for you because
00:42:54 My girlfriend has the exact same taste as me
00:42:56 My girlfriend has the same taste as me
00:42:58 My girlfriend has the same taste as me
00:43:00 And I show her everything
00:43:02 That I like
00:43:04 And she always feels exactly like I do
00:43:06 And I hated this movie
00:43:08 And she hated the movie
00:43:10 And it was
00:43:12 I felt like the first 20 minutes
00:43:14 Was a lot of me going
00:43:16 Ah yes, thank you movie
00:43:18 His name is strawberry milk, you son of a bitch
00:43:20 Thank you
00:43:22 My little pony movie
00:43:24 For proving that there are things about the show
00:43:26 That are obviously like interesting or good
00:43:28 So that it doesn't look like I'm insane for liking this
00:43:30 But then as it goes on
00:43:32 And there's so many songs
00:43:34 So many fucking piss breaks in this movie
00:43:36 The songs, the songs
00:43:38 The range from mediocre to bad
00:43:40 I've always liked all the songs
00:43:42 Hold on, hold on
00:43:44 You said that, hold on
00:43:46 Jackie was saying that too
00:43:48 I completely disagree
00:43:50 There were a lot of great songs in the show
00:43:52 We all knew the words of them
00:43:54 I know the words
00:43:56 I haven't watched MLP in fucking years
00:43:58 And I still remember all the songs
00:44:00 That were good, 20 minutes after
00:44:02 All the songs that were good
00:44:04 You cannot tell me that you don't like
00:44:06 Giggle at the ghosties
00:44:08 I can't tell me
00:44:10 You can't tell me you don't like the cupcake song
00:44:12 It's a good song
00:44:14 You can't tell me you don't like
00:44:16 The songs fucking
00:44:18 But here's the thing
00:44:20 Even if you don't like those songs
00:44:22 You remember them
00:44:24 They got good hooks and shit
00:44:26 I don't remember shit from this movie
00:44:28 None of them are memorable
00:44:30 I remember the second song
00:44:32 It was literally friend like me from Aladdin
00:44:34 There were no differences
00:44:36 That was the only song in the movie
00:44:38 I didn't hate so I guess that's why
00:44:40 Can we acknowledge the fact
00:44:42 That the songs were absolutely pointless
00:44:44 Because they established something
00:44:46 And then they take a few minutes
00:44:48 To sing about the already established thing
00:44:50 Oh hey Twilight
00:44:52 We're here, we're gonna help you
00:44:54 Now let's sing about how we're gonna help you
00:44:56 Oh hey, I'm the Swab and Colton guy
00:44:58 But no sings
00:45:00 Let's sing about it
00:45:02 Tempest or whatever her name was
00:45:04 With her song is that she's standing
00:45:06 In a room singing
00:45:08 As soon as that happened
00:45:10 I was like this is gonna be boring
00:45:12 But the flashback was good
00:45:14 That was the worst part of the movie
00:45:16 Every part of the movie
00:45:18 Every part is the worst part of the movie
00:45:20 I wanna address
00:45:22 Probably my biggest complaint
00:45:24 About this movie
00:45:26 Is how badly
00:45:28 It copies Disney movies
00:45:30 Every song
00:45:32 Is a ripoff version of a Disney song
00:45:34 Every new character
00:45:36 Okay, the main villain
00:45:38 He's literally Hades from
00:45:40 Our greed completely
00:45:42 I had that in my blue flame
00:45:44 He's all like I'm a
00:45:46 I'm this guy, I'm a funny guy
00:45:48 I love merchandise, I'm his yo
00:45:50 I love his rebranding
00:45:52 Is it that different from like discord though
00:45:54 I got the feeling they were trying to do like a discord
00:45:56 You're an unrelated problem
00:45:58 That I had with the Storm King
00:46:00 He's so much like Tyric
00:46:02 Yeah, that's amazing
00:46:04 Then you've got the girl
00:46:06 Tempest
00:46:08 All of her facial expressions
00:46:10 Are literally copy pastes
00:46:12 Of Isma from the Emperor's New Groove
00:46:14 And the placement of the
00:46:16 Bunga character is Cron
00:46:18 Isma was way more expressive
00:46:20 Isma was way more expressive
00:46:22 But all of Tempest's expressions
00:46:24 That she does have are copied from Isma
00:46:26 The fifth doll Tony was so upset
00:46:28 She should have personality wise
00:46:30 No, but the animation
00:46:32 A Tempest issue
00:46:34 Due to my past
00:46:36 Racial dysphoria
00:46:38 Which I have fully overcome
00:46:40 That's all in the past that's over
00:46:42 Due to those past unpleasantnesses
00:46:44 I was heavily triggered
00:46:46 I was heavily triggered by Tempest
00:46:48 And I was very interested
00:46:50 I was very interested in hearing her backstory
00:46:52 And I was so let down when I finally heard it
00:46:54 Because you can infer everything
00:46:56 That there's nothing to her backstory
00:46:58 Other than what you can see at a fucking glance
00:47:00 You see that she's a unicorn
00:47:02 And her horn's broken
00:47:04 What's her backstory is that she broke her horn
00:47:06 That's the whole thing
00:47:08 It's like she was betrayed by her friends
00:47:10 She was wandering into a fucking bear cave
00:47:12 And they're like oh we shouldn't do this
00:47:14 And she was like nah I want my ball
00:47:16 And then they didn't want to play with her
00:47:18 Because their horn kept shooting out death explosions
00:47:20 By accident
00:47:22 And understandably she's a little upset about it
00:47:24 She's a little upset
00:47:26 Her friends don't like her because she's crippled
00:47:28 That's the reason you come out and say it
00:47:30 Movies come out and say it
00:47:32 By the way I did want to point out
00:47:34 That Tyric
00:47:36 And his white legion of faceless goons
00:47:38 Clearly represent the disgusting white race
00:47:40 And diversity champions over them in the end
00:47:42 So uh
00:47:44 They only have black people
00:47:46 Exactly the human white mumkeys
00:47:48 Weird cat man
00:47:50 Whose design I hate
00:47:52 Why was he so black
00:47:54 Yeah he was
00:47:56 Dude dude you want you want
00:47:58 That's the point
00:48:00 It doesn't matter it's fine
00:48:02 It's not how it was
00:48:04 It bothered me that he was the only cat
00:48:06 It bothered me that there were no other cats
00:48:08 It's kind of true
00:48:10 I think it's weird that like
00:48:12 Maybe if everyone in the town
00:48:14 Like was black
00:48:16 It would make sense
00:48:18 But the fact that this guy is super black
00:48:20 Would nobody else
00:48:22 Dude put that aside because the weird thing is
00:48:24 The sea pony queen like clearly has like
00:48:26 That accent and then her daughter
00:48:28 Not even close
00:48:30 She's pinkie pie too
00:48:32 Cat bro is
00:48:34 Cat bro's animation
00:48:36 Is clearly based on the black guy
00:48:38 From uh well the black
00:48:40 Bad guy from princess and the frog
00:48:42 Whereas the song he sings is
00:48:44 Friend like me by genie
00:48:46 The whole movie is just cobbled
00:48:48 And the fucking stupid rainbow dash song
00:48:50 Is just everything is awesome from the Lego movie
00:48:52 Like this is just cobbled together
00:48:54 Ideas of other movies
00:48:56 Other better movies for that matter
00:48:58 That happens when you try to like it dude
00:49:00 I want to harp on
00:49:02 I want to harp on the similarities between the cat guy
00:49:04 And Aladdin specifically
00:49:06 Because he has the same sort of like uh
00:49:08 Like MC Escher uh lower body
00:49:10 That Aladdin has when he moves
00:49:12 He's in this desert type rule of setting
00:49:14 Which I hate by the way I'm gonna give that one to get to the location
00:49:16 In this movie but also there is this
00:49:18 Specific shot in that scene
00:49:20 Where he is like
00:49:22 Like he's lowering down a plank
00:49:24 Across two buildings for the pony
00:49:26 Which is literally a like screen
00:49:28 Re-draw trace
00:49:30 Of a shot from Aladdin
00:49:32 That exact same shot is set up and composed
00:49:34 Like an exact shot from Aladdin
00:49:36 Where Aladdin puts down a plank between
00:49:38 Buildings for Jasmine
00:49:40 During the whole pirate scene
00:49:42 I gotta think of a pony name for my
00:49:44 I don't know
00:49:46 Whatever pony she is
00:49:48 Big slut
00:49:50 The pirate scene
00:49:52 Was um
00:49:54 Very reminiscent of uh
00:49:56 Atlantis the Disney movie Atlantis
00:49:58 The design of the uh
00:50:00 The function of this movie is
00:50:02 If you're into the pony brony
00:50:04 Mindset then it's a hey
00:50:06 Here's an episode that feels cinematic
00:50:08 And if you go into it thinking oh man
00:50:10 I hope it wows me
00:50:12 Every single time something kind of good happens
00:50:14 You will juice every single ounce of juice
00:50:16 That you can get out of it and try to suck it up as much as possible
00:50:18 To justify the fact that you're trying to like it
00:50:20 And then every single thing that's bad will fuck you up
00:50:22 You know there's always concede
00:50:24 You have to like accept if you want to have a tolerable experience
00:50:26 The problem with your premise for me
00:50:28 Is that I don't like the show anymore
00:50:30 So it's not like if I just view it as an episode
00:50:32 That's cinematic then it's like
00:50:34 Why am I watching my pony
00:50:36 That should be the review, the review should be
00:50:38 Hang on, yeah it would be cinematic
00:50:40 I don't know anymore, it says why wasn't it the masterpiece
00:50:44 I want to say something
00:50:46 Since we're on the subject
00:50:48 Give or take
00:50:50 It's just like the writing of the whole thing
00:50:52 Was absolutely abysmal
00:50:54 I'm so disappointed in the writers
00:50:56 Like they couldn't even do a proper like
00:50:58 Chekhov's gun
00:51:00 I wanted to say this point a lot earlier
00:51:02 When we were talking about the rainboom by the way
00:51:04 This was the second point I never got to
00:51:06 Like the whole rainboom thing
00:51:08 I think that was their attempt
00:51:10 At like a Chekhov's gun
00:51:12 Like oh she wanted to do this but she couldn't
00:51:14 Then they mentioned it a second time
00:51:16 But she didn't and then eventually she got to do it
00:51:18 And that's like the worst
00:51:20 Application
00:51:22 She ended up being useless
00:51:24 Yeah that too
00:51:26 They're so incompetent
00:51:28 Like the main five
00:51:30 They made absolutely useless
00:51:32 But they were so incompetent
00:51:34 They couldn't even like
00:51:36 Divide the uselessness equally between
00:51:38 The main five
00:51:40 It's just like because
00:51:42 They gave Pinkie Pie all the reactions
00:51:44 And because they gave Pinkie Pie
00:51:46 All the reactions
00:51:48 She just kind of like
00:51:50 She's the mean one
00:51:52 But like she completely killed the tone
00:51:54 Every time the tension was up
00:51:56 She killed it because they gave her the reaction
00:51:58 They gave her screen time
00:52:00 And she killed everything
00:52:02 Even more than just the jokes themselves
00:52:04 Being bad which they all were
00:52:06 There was like one or two jokes
00:52:08 There was exactly one joke that was fun
00:52:10 And it was when the pirates are like
00:52:12 Let's do bad things
00:52:14 And one of them says let's scar them
00:52:16 And Rarity's like
00:52:18 Emotionally
00:52:20 That was great
00:52:22 That was literally the only joke
00:52:24 There was a bunch of jokes I needed honestly
00:52:26 I laughed at some of the Bunga jokes
00:52:28 Oh no
00:52:30 What the hell dude
00:52:32 That was a nice joke
00:52:34 Dude I'm gonna saddle you up
00:52:36 I'm gonna knock you right off your horse
00:52:38 I'm gonna knock you down
00:52:40 I'm not very critical of comedy
00:52:42 I liked the whole
00:52:44 Bunga was like surprisingly not terrible
00:52:46 By the way
00:52:48 Not terrible but not good
00:52:50 What I didn't like about him
00:52:52 Is that as the movie went on
00:52:54 I felt like he got progressively more retarded
00:52:56 Early on he didn't seem like just
00:52:58 An idiot he seemed like more of a
00:53:00 Like weird
00:53:02 Like he thinks he's a badass
00:53:04 Kind of but like also
00:53:06 It's just like a stoner comedy kind of guy
00:53:08 Kind of lazy
00:53:10 But then as it goes on
00:53:12 He starts acting like more
00:53:14 There's a lot of characters that seem kind of like
00:53:16 They're like done with improv behind the microphone
00:53:18 And it's uh it's it's competent
00:53:20 But it doesn't really fit the whole format of
00:53:22 DMLP thing so
00:53:24 I will compliment this movie
00:53:26 The fact that um all the new characters
00:53:28 Have better voice actors
00:53:30 Than anyone in the actual show
00:53:32 That is indeed true
00:53:34 Like they definitely brought in like real actors
00:53:36 Or something I don't know who any of them are
00:53:38 I didn't look it up but like all the new characters
00:53:40 Were like oh they are like voiced
00:53:42 Competently and not like a you know
00:53:44 Like a children's show
00:53:46 I have no problem with that
00:53:48 I really liked him this voice
00:53:50 That's Emily Blunt by the way
00:53:52 The directing of the movie was ranging from
00:53:54 Okay to pretty good sometimes
00:53:56 Because I was having a relaxed viewing experience
00:53:58 I could just naturally notice things for example
00:54:00 By the way uh it was a real
00:54:02 Okay I'm sorry
00:54:04 When the uh the assistant guy who was like
00:54:06 Cronk shows up right you see him come out of a ship
00:54:08 And you see him holding a box you can't see him
00:54:10 All you can see are his feet and I particularly
00:54:12 Thought out of my head oh by pedal
00:54:14 So it's you know going into this movie
00:54:16 You're thinking ponies ponies ponies ponies
00:54:18 Four legs four legs two legs
00:54:20 Contrast right that's why I like the whole
00:54:22 On an adventure thing it's like what the fuck is this
00:54:24 Disney cat I sure as hell
00:54:26 Feel like I we're not in equestria anymore
00:54:28 Right that's the whole reason I like that whole scene
00:54:30 Right of the contrast and also a nice
00:54:32 Directing technique that was so well done
00:54:34 You probably never noticed it
00:54:36 I feel like weird characters like that show up in equestria
00:54:38 Well the level of contrast
00:54:40 Was what I wanted out of a cinematic experience
00:54:42 Right so then the whole adventure
00:54:44 Up to the point that they get to the sea pony realm
00:54:46 They're going from left to right
00:54:48 The whole time ah nice you know
00:54:50 You always feel like you're going further and further away
00:54:52 Then when they go back they're going to the left
00:54:54 Again I went into it with ok episode
00:54:56 But it's cinematic it did the fuck out of that
00:54:58 If it just had good songs
00:55:00 And didn't have a stupid twilight fucks up
00:55:02 And everyone hates it for five minutes thing
00:55:04 That was the worst thing
00:55:06 That was hilarious
00:55:08 You took this win for my sales
00:55:10 I can't believe
00:55:12 I want to
00:55:14 Twilight would resort to fucking theft
00:55:16 That was the stupidest fucking bullshit
00:55:18 Conflict and it happened
00:55:20 I checked out of the whole movie
00:55:22 Hold on hold on
00:55:24 I want to challenge Davoo's premise
00:55:26 Of the fact that we were like
00:55:28 That we're watching it wrong by nitpicking it to death
00:55:30 Because Davoo but as you said
00:55:32 If we watch this it's just an episode of the show
00:55:34 And the question is why are we watching my little pony
00:55:36 So the only justification for watching
00:55:38 This movie is that we're going to do a podcast
00:55:40 About it where we bitch about it incessantly
00:55:42 That's the joke
00:55:44 That is why we're here
00:55:46 In the MLP analysis community
00:55:48 Are we going to all watch the MLP movie
00:55:50 And get into a podcast
00:55:52 And go well you know it was fine for what it is
00:55:54 And then roll credits like
00:55:56 Where's the podcast if we do that
00:55:58 I just think I optimized my fucking viewing experience
00:56:00 Well
00:56:02 I'm going to say that I did not
00:56:04 I was not looking for nitpicking
00:56:06 Oh do I like this thing properly
00:56:08 Just like it or don't
00:56:10 I'm going to record that I have a drag kicking and screaming
00:56:12 And coming up with an OC
00:56:14 Like refers to me by it
00:56:16 After I was
00:56:18 I'm sorry
00:56:20 We have been around for years
00:56:22 You just came out with it
00:56:24 You can't expect us to be on board instantly
00:56:26 You can't be dragged into this episode
00:56:28 I was like why do I need to be on this episode
00:56:30 I never did pony analysis and Nate was like
00:56:32 No you have to do it
00:56:34 I'm sorry
00:56:36 We're so fucking sorry that you had to be here
00:56:38 Alright who cares
00:56:40 Gib was saying something go ahead
00:56:42 I was going to say in responding to
00:56:44 Like the thing Davoo said about the cinematic
00:56:46 Camera movement
00:56:48 Directing
00:56:50 I actually remember like multiple moments
00:56:52 Where I'm like oh that's neat
00:56:54 That's a cool camera move
00:56:56 That's a cool special like
00:56:58 They did that very well
00:57:00 The backgrounds and the camera and the directing
00:57:02 Was actually really good the whole way through
00:57:04 The scene where the pirate ship gets attacked
00:57:06 They did like shaky cam for a while
00:57:08 That was interesting
00:57:10 It did really like
00:57:12 It's in a terrible part of the movie
00:57:14 It's when Twilight is sad and she's sitting on the rock
00:57:16 In like a mist
00:57:18 That scene looked really cool and was framed really well
00:57:20 I want to point out
00:57:22 I've talked about this in one of my videos before
00:57:24 But when you do shaky cam in animation
00:57:26 That necessarily means that they have animated
00:57:28 Beyond the parameters of the frame
00:57:30 And are shaking a camera through it
00:57:32 Which I always think is interesting
00:57:34 Because you think of it
00:57:36 As just they're shaking a camera
00:57:38 Then when you think about the fact that it's all hand drawn
00:57:40 It's like wait what is the camera pointing at
00:57:42 Oh right
00:57:44 And as we kind of know earlier
00:57:46 The scene where a chip
00:57:48 A horn kicks the shit out of that
00:57:50 One guy random goon
00:57:52 In the fucking town
00:57:54 And it's this awesome like four part single shot
00:57:56 Take down
00:57:58 That was a cool moment
00:58:00 Yeah I love Simba
00:58:04 I love
00:58:06 Tom
00:58:08 You're saying something
00:58:10 I just wanted to point out something
00:58:12 I thought it was really funny how this whole movie
00:58:14 Can just boil down to Twilight forgets
00:58:16 So you can teleport the movie
00:58:18 Yeah I was going to bring that up
00:58:20 She's like trapped in this fucking cage
00:58:22 And I'm just like bitch
00:58:26 Oh my fucking god
00:58:28 To be fair
00:58:30 There was some weird stuff going on
00:58:32 Where it was shown that the shields
00:58:34 Those guys seemed to be using seemed pretty resistant to magic
00:58:36 But you wouldn't use the magic on that
00:58:38 You just pop away
00:58:40 Maybe there was a magical field
00:58:42 What would be the comment
00:58:44 On Tom's video
00:58:46 Fuck you
00:58:48 Okay watching this
00:58:50 I want to talk about the most interesting aspect of watching the movie to me
00:58:52 Like completely
00:58:54 Unrelated to the actual quality of the film
00:58:56 What was the most interesting to me
00:58:58 As I watched this was I could see
00:59:00 All the fan art
00:59:02 I could hear the fan songs
00:59:04 Like I could hear the remixes
00:59:06 I could hear the lines that would become memes
00:59:08 There's the scene
00:59:10 I could see the porn
00:59:12 The scene where like a cake falls on
00:59:14 Like a, was it Twilight or Pinky
00:59:16 And like on Twilight and like all of its
00:59:18 Dripping off of her and stuff
00:59:20 Like all this white liquid is
00:59:22 You're projectively dripping off of her
00:59:24 Dude
00:59:26 There would have been porn of that scene
00:59:28 There would have been
00:59:30 There's the energy
00:59:32 I mean actually there might be
00:59:34 I haven't checked but like
00:59:36 If they weren't all herded into a room at Dashcon
00:59:38 And assassinated
00:59:40 I don't know how
00:59:42 Active the community is right now
00:59:44 But like I could hear
00:59:46 There was like one song that
00:59:48 Because as
00:59:50 Equity pointed out in the
00:59:52 What was the name of the
00:59:54 T.V.S.S.B.P
00:59:56 Two very special sunpony
00:59:58 As the very special sunponies
01:00:00 Pointed out
01:00:02 While I unlike Equity
01:00:04 Do like a lot of the songs of the show
01:00:06 They are almost the exact same song
01:00:08 They all use the same chord progressions
01:00:10 And there was a song in this movie that did that
01:00:12 And because of that I could hear the remixes
01:00:14 Like I could hear where the beats would
01:00:16 Fall and everything and it was really trippy
01:00:18 For me as somebody who consumed
01:00:20 Probably more fan content of MLP
01:00:22 Than any other human on earth
01:00:24 I'm willing to be forgiving of the songs
01:00:26 For being all pretty similar in structure
01:00:28 Because like this is MLP we're talking about
01:00:30 This is a kids movie that we don't need
01:00:32 They just were also not good
01:00:34 Because the hooks were bad
01:00:36 That's a separate issue
01:00:38 The good songs from old MLP
01:00:40 Were still simple
01:00:42 The way I've always seen the music
01:00:44 I mean this is just sort of the way
01:00:46 I listen to music in general
01:00:48 Is that I like the instrumentality
01:00:50 More so than the chord progression
01:00:52 I don't pay attention to what chords are being played
01:00:54 I like
01:00:56 The instruments being used
01:00:58 And the melodies that are going along
01:01:00 With them and it's like oh that's really cool
01:01:02 A little Spanish guitar bit
01:01:04 I like that in a thing
01:01:06 I liked all the songs because
01:01:08 Regardless of how similar
01:01:10 They are to other songs in MLP
01:01:12 They got good instruments
01:01:14 And Daniel Ingram is good at that
01:01:16 I think
01:01:18 Gibbon I'm going to shave you
01:01:20 I'm going to groom you
01:01:22 Hey let me tell you
01:01:24 My favorite thing about this movie too
01:01:26 My favorite thing was
01:01:28 When Twilight reveals herself
01:01:30 To be literally friendship challenged
01:01:32 So her friends were all
01:01:34 You know, entertaining
01:01:36 The princess or whatever
01:01:38 And it is in fact revealed that Twilight is like
01:01:40 Having Twilight be the princess of friendship
01:01:42 Is like hiring someone with Down syndrome
01:01:44 To be the head of Homeland Security
01:01:46 They could be a fine person
01:01:48 But they're just not right for the job
01:01:50 No justification for that scene
01:01:52 It's unbelievable
01:01:54 What are you talking about when she steals the ore
01:01:56 I can't imagine
01:01:58 Just like in Dungeon Crawlstone's soup
01:02:00 I'm just pointing out another moment
01:02:02 Where she forgets she could teleport
01:02:04 I'm just saying, I'm just throwing that one out there
01:02:06 At the very beginning of the song
01:02:08 She's trying to get away from the guys
01:02:10 The princesses just did nothing
01:02:12 By the way, they did not move
01:02:14 They did not say go away
01:02:16 How fucking annoying was it
01:02:18 When Derpy was the one that jumped in front of the bullet
01:02:20 And took the bullet to her
01:02:22 I was so confused by that
01:02:24 Did the rainbow swoop in the saber
01:02:26 Did she replace Twilight?
01:02:28 I guess that's what happened
01:02:30 I was very confused by that
01:02:32 Because you see Rainbow fly in and grab her
01:02:34 No, you cut away too fast
01:02:36 You see Derpy for a few seconds
01:02:38 Just before when it's zooming in on Twilight
01:02:40 You can see Derpy at the bottom left corner
01:02:42 Is she just behind her or something?
01:02:44 No, I remember specifically
01:02:46 It was confusing
01:02:48 But I did piece together that it was Derpy
01:02:50 Just because it cut away too fast
01:02:52 I knew there was a joke there
01:02:54 But I just needed one quarter of a second longer
01:02:56 To process what happened
01:02:58 But I cut away, fuck you, I'm not reminding
01:03:00 Speaking of that
01:03:02 Things dragged too long
01:03:04 There was weird, awkward, long transitions
01:03:06 Between scenes that really bothered me
01:03:08 Maybe it's a cinematic thing
01:03:10 I guess we kind of talked about this a little bit
01:03:12 But the fact that once again
01:03:14 The three princesses are fucking useless
01:03:16 This is the setting
01:03:18 To really show them off
01:03:20 And do something cool with them finally
01:03:22 But to be instantly again
01:03:24 Relegated to nothing
01:03:26 In the first 20 minutes
01:03:28 It's so fucking stock
01:03:30 And it pisses me off
01:03:32 Why the fuck is the villain so intimidating?
01:03:34 What is the basis of his power?
01:03:36 Because all he seems to have was the staff
01:03:38 That is established that fucking Tempest
01:03:40 Gave to him
01:03:42 Right
01:03:44 I guess he just had a really good marketing campaign
01:03:46 But don't you think it's kind of retarded too
01:03:48 The fact that this character Tempest
01:03:50 Like why wasn't she the big bad
01:03:52 Because her whole point is that
01:03:54 I don't trust anybody anymore
01:03:56 But then trust this guy to do what he says
01:03:58 So it just makes her look retarded
01:04:00 And she was right, she was right now trusting one
01:04:02 Because he didn't do what he said he was going to do
01:04:04 So she was right
01:04:06 That's literally the fucking story with Tyric
01:04:08 She is Discord and he is Tyric
01:04:10 And also like she's like way too competent
01:04:12 To be his underling
01:04:14 She did every single thing for him
01:04:16 She did everything
01:04:18 It's so dumb
01:04:20 There was some promise here
01:04:22 That all hinges on that he had the unique ability
01:04:24 To heal her horn
01:04:26 But no, anyone who had the staff
01:04:28 Anyone who held the staff would have had the exact same power
01:04:30 I don't think that's true because even though
01:04:32 Twilight has the staff at the end
01:04:34 She still doesn't heal her
01:04:36 I'm thinking that maybe that the staff
01:04:38 Actually let her do that
01:04:40 Because it gave him power over the sky
01:04:42 But none of the princesses have healing powers
01:04:44 Except Caden's
01:04:46 But that's the thing
01:04:48 This is the issue I'm talking about
01:04:50 Why would she agree to be his servant
01:04:52 Before he gets the staff
01:04:54 And then bring him the staff
01:04:56 If like he
01:04:58 Why didn't she just do it herself
01:05:00 That's very true
01:05:02 And very stupid
01:05:04 What exactly did he bring to the table for
01:05:06 I mean that's like that's the pain
01:05:08 I guess the troops
01:05:10 I guess he gave her the troops
01:05:12 That's the general bad guy logic though
01:05:14 Did she need the troops though the whole time
01:05:16 She just fucking steamrolls everybody
01:05:18 When she got in with him
01:05:20 Maybe he picked her up as a little orphan
01:05:22 Nobody likes you but I'll train you to be a child soldier
01:05:24 You didn't see him as established
01:05:26 Yeah
01:05:28 That's some headcanon there
01:05:30 That's some incorice territory
01:05:32 That's fucking way
01:05:34 Then what does it matter
01:05:36 Since we're talking about this
01:05:38 I did want to say
01:05:40 My favorite part of the episode
01:05:42 There's a brief moment during the assault
01:05:44 When they're raiding the place
01:05:46 Fluttershy
01:05:48 Fluttershy
01:05:50 They're all fighting one
01:05:52 Fluttershy calmly
01:05:54 Acts like a psychiatrist
01:05:56 Or a psychologist to one of the troops
01:05:58 That's how she takes it out
01:06:00 That was my favorite moment
01:06:02 By the way
01:06:04 Who else felt it was a huge relief
01:06:06 When they did the
01:06:08 Like the discord balloon at the beginning
01:06:10 And that to me was a signal
01:06:12 He would not be in the movie and I was like
01:06:14 Oh thank god
01:06:16 Speaking about the villains and shit
01:06:18 So okay
01:06:20 Wait a minute where was he
01:06:22 Why didn't they fucking get him
01:06:24 The magic in this whole show is kind of broken
01:06:26 Phantom hard
01:06:28 Discord
01:06:30 Discord isn't in the movie
01:06:32 Because this script must have been written forever ago
01:06:34 Because Starlight wasn't in the movie either
01:06:36 And she's one of the main characters now
01:06:38 So they just kind of crammed everybody into the movie
01:06:40 I'm assuming this script was written years ago
01:06:42 Right after season 4
01:06:44 That's where I would say it takes place
01:06:46 In the timeline
01:06:48 I didn't even think about it
01:06:50 But the conspicuous absence of discord
01:06:52 Is like a huge fucking deal breaker
01:06:54 So here's what's happening
01:06:56 Canterlot was sieged
01:06:58 And now that's under attack
01:07:00 But the rest of Equestria is still fine
01:07:02 Why did that go on?
01:07:04 It's not like the entire population was fucking obliterated
01:07:06 They could go back to Ponyville
01:07:08 They could go back to fucking
01:07:10 Wherever there is
01:07:12 Go get your friendship nuke
01:07:14 Use the friendship nuke
01:07:16 Why didn't they use the tree?
01:07:18 Remember when there were Native Americans in My Little Pony
01:07:20 I do
01:07:22 Don't reveal the trail of tears
01:07:24 Even leaving didn't even matter
01:07:26 They could have finished
01:07:28 Solved everything right in the beginning
01:07:30 Because they go on this huge big quest
01:07:32 To get this orb that does nothing
01:07:34 And all they do is get the princess to help them
01:07:36 And she does literally enough to
01:07:38 In the end they just beat up the bad guys
01:07:40 It's really smooth
01:07:42 How do you guys all feel about the fact that somebody
01:07:44 Fucking died
01:07:46 Dude
01:07:48 I almost forgot
01:07:50 That was fucking insane
01:07:52 Has this happened
01:07:54 And then they play with this fucking corpse
01:07:56 I do
01:07:58 Guys
01:08:00 Guys though
01:08:02 Did you watch the credits though
01:08:04 In the credits
01:08:06 In the credits
01:08:08 His eyes move so it implies
01:08:10 He's still alive
01:08:12 Are you kidding me
01:08:14 That ruins the only good part of this movie
01:08:16 I know
01:08:18 That's even worse
01:08:20 That's even worse because he's eternally
01:08:22 Severed
01:08:24 He's like that guy in Jojo
01:08:26 He's like that guy in Jojo that Josuke
01:08:28 Put in the rocks
01:08:30 Yeah
01:08:32 The show
01:08:34 Was anybody else actually like a little
01:08:36 Shook by that
01:08:38 That like a straight up murder happened
01:08:40 It was an accident
01:08:42 I was just thinking about
01:08:44 But the fact that an onscreen death
01:08:46 Occurred
01:08:48 I believe Sombra was killed
01:08:50 I think Sombra did die
01:08:52 It wasn't very graphic though
01:08:54 This was like
01:08:56 They show a shard
01:08:58 A shard of Storm King's head
01:09:00 Slide across the ground
01:09:02 I hate to bring this up again
01:09:04 But don't you think that's another
01:09:06 Disney trope that they ate
01:09:08 The villain dies
01:09:10 The villain dies by falling and it's not exactly anyone's fault
01:09:12 That's the funny thing about it
01:09:14 I kind of thought it was
01:09:16 inappropriate for the villain to
01:09:18 Die horribly in a My Little Pony movie
01:09:20 It was a little weird
01:09:22 A movie that has no mistakes
01:09:24 And where most of it
01:09:26 The villain's like a goofy dude
01:09:28 He doesn't come across as like
01:09:30 A violently evil
01:09:32 He didn't kill anybody
01:09:34 Friendship is magic but you
01:09:36 Cross your fucking dead
01:09:38 I just played
01:09:40 Cuphead
01:09:42 Which has me thinking about all the horrible
01:09:44 Fucked up things that used to happen in cartoons
01:09:46 And I want more of that
01:09:48 I want so much death in my cartoons
01:09:50 It's not that it was weird in this movie
01:09:52 Where like nothing that bad
01:09:54 Like in the case of
01:09:56 Sombra
01:09:58 I'm pretty sure he does die
01:10:00 Phantom
01:10:02 It's like obliterated
01:10:04 And he's like evaporated
01:10:06 But Sombra was a much
01:10:08 Bigger threat though than this dude
01:10:10 Sombra was just an angry
01:10:12 Evil guy who like
01:10:14 Turned everybody to crystal and was like
01:10:16 Another problem with the movie is that the
01:10:18 Stakes are already too fucking hot
01:10:20 The only way to have a movie that would actually be
01:10:22 Significantly more epic is if it was like
01:10:24 End of Iqwan Gelyon and where like everything's all abstract
01:10:26 I love that
01:10:28 I love that movie
01:10:30 What I was thinking about when I saw that
01:10:32 Was I really started running for my money
01:10:34 That's a great line
01:10:36 It all returns to Muffins
01:10:38 Coming down
01:10:40 Coming down
01:10:42 That's perfect
01:10:44 Because it's a really inappropriate word
01:10:46 And that's exactly what a pony remix
01:10:48 Of that song would be
01:10:50 When that guy died though
01:10:52 My mind started racing about the board meeting
01:10:54 That must have happened where they were discussing like
01:10:56 What context is it acceptable to have a character
01:10:58 Actually die in
01:11:00 First of all he's frozen into stone
01:11:02 So that he can shatter and no one actually does
01:11:04 Anything to him too
01:11:06 He has to like be like Ben was saying
01:11:08 Anyone's fault
01:11:10 He dies exactly like Gaston
01:11:12 Like his aggressive action
01:11:14 Is what ultimately causes
01:11:16 Even though I'm sure Twilight could have easily
01:11:18 Fucking targeted him too on that hovering
01:11:20 Yeah
01:11:22 Like that guy he had no powers
01:11:24 He just had a staff
01:11:26 And then he loses the staff
01:11:28 Why did they just fucking kill him when he lost the staff
01:11:30 Had just random fucking bubble gum
01:11:32 God mode killer gum
01:11:34 That just turns people to stone
01:11:36 Like they are
01:11:38 Plus
01:11:40 Even when he had the staff that one time
01:11:42 She faces off with him head to head
01:11:44 And they prove to be like an even fucking match
01:11:46 Him with the powered up staff
01:11:48 What the fuck
01:11:50 That fucking obliterated everyone
01:11:52 And they did not even try
01:11:54 That incredible
01:11:56 I didn't even think about that
01:11:58 I wonder if you could do a cut
01:12:00 Of this movie where it's the beginning
01:12:02 Where he gets the staff
01:12:04 You cut the entire middle of the movie
01:12:06 And it just cuts to the assault
01:12:08 And nothing really of value would be lost
01:12:10 I'm going into head canon now
01:12:12 But maybe it's like breaking the horn
01:12:14 Didn't rob her of her power
01:12:16 Of the ability to control it
01:12:18 So her power is coming out raw
01:12:20 And unfiltered now
01:12:22 She loses magic all over the movie
01:12:24 Her tone works
01:12:26 It only works
01:12:28 For that one specific thing
01:12:30 Which is funnily enough
01:12:32 Her super special
01:12:34 She's Fizzle Pop Sparkle Butter
01:12:36 It was Fizzle Pop Berry Twist
01:12:38 Fizzle Pop Berry Twist
01:12:40 So I assume that her fireworks were going to be
01:12:42 Her super special talent anyway
01:12:44 So the fact that her horn breaking
01:12:46 Includes all magic other than that one thing
01:12:48 She was destined to be good at
01:12:50 It's pretty neat, but I guess that's just equestrian destiny
01:12:52 In action
01:12:54 Since we're talking about the staff
01:12:56 Why do the princesses in their castle
01:12:58 Have this one thing
01:13:00 Where you put the staff in
01:13:02 They can rob them of their powers
01:13:04 I don't fucking know
01:13:06 It was a slot for this staff
01:13:08 He had the staff
01:13:10 He brought the staff with him
01:13:12 Maybe they built that
01:13:14 In the week that they had
01:13:16 After the ponies
01:13:18 If you have to head canon away it wasn't written well
01:13:20 You mean three days canonically
01:13:22 Three days canonically
01:13:24 Maybe in three days they carved out the mystic sigils
01:13:26 Required for the ceremony
01:13:28 That you just said could have been so helpful
01:13:30 Over the years
01:13:32 If you have to head canon it's not good writing
01:13:34 That could have saved us so much
01:13:36 I just figured it goes without
01:13:38 Fucking saying
01:13:40 But every time you bring that up you get fucking shit on
01:13:42 So fuck you
01:13:44 Well head canoning is fun
01:13:46 It is fun, but it's fun
01:13:48 But it's not a defensive shit
01:13:50 Writing
01:13:52 I'm not sure we should really listen to anything that tall tales
01:13:54 Known denouncer and lever of the
01:13:56 fandom has to say about this
01:13:58 I never left the fandom
01:14:00 I'm still here guys
01:14:02 I'm looking for life
01:14:04 I'm still here guys
01:14:06 Alive and kicking
01:14:08 Here's what you don't understand about the storm king and his
01:14:10 His ilk
01:14:12 So immediately once he captured everyone
01:14:14 We learned about this guy named storm king
01:14:16 Never heard about him before
01:14:18 The princesses act like they don't know who the fuck this is
01:14:20 Then we leave Equestria and immediately
01:14:22 We're in his territory
01:14:24 All of these locations
01:14:26 The pirates are his control
01:14:28 And the hippogriffs are completely
01:14:30 Outrun and completely obliterated
01:14:32 The ponies are extremely nationalistic and isolationist
01:14:34 Don't you find it retarded though
01:14:36 That everybody's been fucked over
01:14:38 By this guy
01:14:40 But as soon
01:14:42 As soon as we're in trouble
01:14:44 We're gonna go get help
01:14:46 Yeah
01:14:48 That's exactly what I was thinking
01:14:50 First they came for the griffons and I did nothing
01:14:52 For the pirates
01:14:54 Then they came for me and there was no one to help me
01:14:56 But I could actually
01:14:58 Okay
01:15:00 Did you notice
01:15:02 The subtle, not subtle
01:15:04 Blading, racist undertones
01:15:06 Twilight explicitly wanted to establish an ethno state
01:15:08 Within this My Little Pony movie
01:15:10 She keeps saying we can't trust conars
01:15:12 Quote unquote
01:15:14 We can't trust pirates
01:15:16 Come out and say Twilight
01:15:18 You ain't furries
01:15:20 You're a pony just like me
01:15:22 Tempest, I don't understand why you aren't on my side
01:15:24 You're a pony just like me
01:15:26 What's going on here
01:15:28 Did you find it a little bit racist
01:15:30 When Rainbow Dash is saying
01:15:32 This cloven hoove motherfucker over here
01:15:34 Oh my god
01:15:36 Is there some shit here I'm not aware of
01:15:38 Nothing gets my big blue
01:15:40 Horstic rock heart
01:15:42 Than pony racism
01:15:44 I'm not even joking
01:15:46 I love that
01:15:48 She just owns all this land
01:15:50 The hippo grips who
01:15:52 Was specifically saying to contact
01:15:54 Have been already overrun
01:15:56 So like what was the plan here
01:15:58 Not even overrun
01:16:00 Not even overrun but like it's been like
01:16:02 Who even knows how long
01:16:04 Since this happened
01:16:06 The city has been there a while
01:16:08 And Celestia didn't know shit
01:16:10 She didn't know shit
01:16:12 She's in character
01:16:14 Full disclosure I did not watch this entire movie
01:16:16 Oh my fucking god
01:16:18 After the sea pony scene
01:16:20 And then everybody getting mad
01:16:22 At each other and splitting up
01:16:24 That was where I started hitting the forward button
01:16:26 That's where I wanted to hit the forward button
01:16:28 But I watched about
01:16:30 I watched like a couple seconds of every
01:16:32 Five seconds of the rest of the movie
01:16:34 Because I thought there was a new video digi
01:16:36 That you made recently called Thoroughly Analyzing Ponyo
01:16:38 And you talked about how you don't
01:16:40 Like those kinds of scenes in movies
01:16:42 And I can completely respect skipping it
01:16:44 There yes
01:16:46 Because it was just
01:16:48 Twilight's trying to see the pearl
01:16:50 Was super obnoxious and as soon as the scene started
01:16:52 I went oh here we go
01:16:54 They're all going to be mad at each other
01:16:56 And here's what I predicted and I was completely right
01:16:58 They will not have to resolve this
01:17:00 It will just resolve itself
01:17:02 Twilight will be captured
01:17:04 And they'll all come to help her
01:17:06 It won't be that
01:17:08 They have to have a conversation about
01:17:10 What she did wrong or anything like that
01:17:12 She's going to get in trouble
01:17:14 They're going to help her and none of this will have meant anything
01:17:16 We just presume
01:17:18 We just presume that Twilight has learned
01:17:20 Something in all of this
01:17:22 There's no confirmation of that
01:17:24 And she would do it again
01:17:26 She says
01:17:28 Friendship didn't fail me
01:17:30 I failed friendship
01:17:32 Okay what does that mean
01:17:34 Shouldn't she be demoted
01:17:36 Shouldn't those wings go away
01:17:38 He should definitely have to go on a pilgrimage
01:17:40 How many times does Twilight get to learn this lesson
01:17:42 Before we just say you're broken
01:17:44 Your most popular video
01:17:46 Theories on
01:17:48 Alicorn Princess Twilight Sparkle
01:17:50 Your most popular video
01:17:52 You talk about how she earns her wings
01:17:54 In the episode where she didn't even need
01:17:56 To learn anything about friendship
01:17:58 She intuitively fucking got it
01:18:00 Now the rewrite for this lowest point
01:18:02 Scene would be simple AF
01:18:04 They do the song
01:18:06 Twilight's part of the song to the sea ponies
01:18:08 Great job convincing them
01:18:10 And then the queen is all like this is a fun song
01:18:12 But wait you're just trying to manipulate me
01:18:14 I hate you go away and then they're all
01:18:16 Super bummed because they thought they were being really nice
01:18:18 And they were extending a hand of friendship
01:18:20 And they got smacked back down
01:18:22 And maybe you could even have Twilight get a little bit agitated
01:18:24 That all of her learnings about friendship
01:18:26 Didn't work this time
01:18:28 And she could still have a little bit of a kerfuffle with her friends
01:18:30 Not really ideal but you can still
01:18:32 Wax it in there if you need it to
01:18:34 And that's it she could still be
01:18:36 A friendship intuitive as she was
01:18:38 And she learns that she has to
01:18:40 If she wants to do the job right
01:18:42 She has to steal and kill
01:18:44 Twilight at that point
01:18:46 And then she goes and kills the bad
01:18:48 Twilight at that point becomes a
01:18:50 She learns the lesson of becoming a race realist
01:18:52 And realizing that the race realist
01:18:54 Will simply not be able to
01:18:56 Understand her high level pony friendship
01:18:58 Because they are lower beings
01:19:00 That's awesome a race realist
01:19:02 It's a good one
01:19:04 And a new
01:19:06 A new race realist is born
01:19:08 That's a affirmed race realist
01:19:10 Fucking Twilight
01:19:12 Manipulates her friends
01:19:14 Straight out just like
01:19:16 Does not tell them the plan
01:19:18 She could just tell them
01:19:20 Her plan and they would like
01:19:22 Talk about like friends
01:19:24 Because they're not evil like Twilight
01:19:26 They're not smart enough
01:19:28 They're not smart enough
01:19:30 Like the prince of thieves
01:19:32 Wait no Aladdin and the king of thieves
01:19:34 These naive ponies
01:19:36 Still naively trust in the power
01:19:38 Of friendship when Twilight has seen
01:19:40 The error of her ways because the cat man
01:19:42 Would mean to them
01:19:44 With becoming the princess of friendship
01:19:46 She has now got an actual state position
01:19:48 And it is now her responsibility to look at
01:19:50 For the well being of the entire kingdom
01:19:52 She does say that in the beginning of the movie herself
01:19:54 That inherently puts actual friendship
01:19:56 On a lower level
01:19:58 That's not the fucking theme to the whole franchise
01:20:00 So now it's not her priority
01:20:02 It's not her highest priority anymore
01:20:04 I'm about to drop a bombshell
01:20:06 That's gonna completely hijack this conversation
01:20:08 For the next 35 minutes
01:20:10 I'm either gonna
01:20:12 I'm either gonna be jeered
01:20:14 Or I'm gonna be peered
01:20:16 I might be knocked down
01:20:18 I might be saddled up
01:20:20 I might be plumped up
01:20:22 Some of you guys might hold me like 6 feet above water
01:20:24 And boil me, steam me, break up my carapace
01:20:26 You guys might groom me
01:20:28 Twilight, can we
01:20:30 We've been out of this fandom
01:20:32 For God knows how long we've been
01:20:34 Can we please stop pretending
01:20:36 Can we please just be on for ourselves
01:20:38 Twilight being a princess was always a bad idea
01:20:40 And it was never cool
01:20:42 Can we please stop pretending that it was
01:20:44 I have always said from the very beginning
01:20:46 That Twilight becoming a princess should have been
01:20:48 The last episode of my movie
01:20:50 Agreed, yeah for sure
01:20:52 I mean I'm gonna disagree with that
01:20:54 Not to even bring up the fact that
01:20:56 It doesn't make any sense
01:20:58 I mean I think it's okay
01:21:00 I think it's cool but there's just a million ways
01:21:02 It could have been done better which I believe
01:21:04 I know Digi was pretty positive about it
01:21:06 At the time
01:21:08 I don't see any reason it can't happen
01:21:10 I enjoyed the episode
01:21:12 The logic behind it is totally fucking
01:21:14 Totally fucking opaque
01:21:16 I used to say
01:21:18 Even at the time that I think it should have happened
01:21:20 At the end of season 4
01:21:22 Because there should have been an arc
01:21:24 Like season 4 feels like
01:21:26 The arc leading up to her becoming princess
01:21:28 Like when you see the way
01:21:30 That people react to her the way she's not really treated
01:21:32 Like a princess that season
01:21:34 And the way people react to her is like
01:21:36 She's someone important now but not quite
01:21:38 There should have been an arc about her becoming like famous
01:21:40 Or like known as a problem
01:21:42 Solver and like people are coming to her
01:21:44 And as she solves friendship problems
01:21:46 Around Equestria she eventually
01:21:48 Is granted princess status
01:21:50 Maybe establish that that's a thing that can
01:21:52 Happen before springing it on you
01:21:54 Out of nowhere
01:21:56 The thing that I never liked about
01:21:58 The princess thing with the wings
01:22:00 Is that
01:22:02 Yeah it was Celestia and Luna
01:22:04 And that's it
01:22:06 And they were like super special
01:22:08 They erased the sun and the moon
01:22:10 And then you can just become one
01:22:12 And then there's Caden
01:22:14 This was my argument back in the day
01:22:16 They've become less and less interesting
01:22:18 And the lore becomes more and more convoluted
01:22:20 And it's very clear that being a princess
01:22:22 Doesn't mean you
01:22:24 Solved like you're very good at it
01:22:26 It just means that you're
01:22:28 Well that's something
01:22:30 My problem with
01:22:32 We're getting in some deep shit
01:22:34 I think it would have been
01:22:36 Easily possible to make
01:22:38 Twilight becoming a princess make sense
01:22:40 In the narrative and everything
01:22:42 I just think that it was not
01:22:44 It was jumped the gun because of the mandate
01:22:46 From Hasbro to Duke
01:22:48 To kind of work the series around it
01:22:50 And it's not until season 5 that it starts making sense
01:22:52 Where she actually is treated like a princess
01:22:54 It's amazing to think now
01:22:56 That Twilight has been a princess longer than she has
01:22:58 Not been
01:23:00 So my problem with Twilight as an Alicorn
01:23:02 Is that it means that the main six only has
01:23:04 One unicorn now
01:23:06 And look
01:23:08 That's my problem too
01:23:10 Right no no no
01:23:12 As we all know
01:23:14 This might be good information
01:23:16 The appeal of MLP is encased in autism
01:23:18 As you
01:23:20 I know maybe some people have heard of it
01:23:22 We all
01:23:24 You have to chip away the autism
01:23:26 To get to the My Little Pony goodness
01:23:28 I would say that there is
01:23:30 If you had a Venn diagram
01:23:32 Of autism and My Little Pony fans
01:23:34 It's almost just a circle
01:23:36 Right no no no
01:23:38 We are all
01:23:40 Dead in the middle of that
01:23:42 And we're the only ones
01:23:44 On the edge
01:23:46 I am in the middle of that
01:23:48 The main six, most of the ponies
01:23:50 They all have the same basic character shape
01:23:52 With some slight differences, different color palettes
01:23:54 Sonic the Hedgehog is the same
01:23:56 The sort of symmetry is pleasing
01:23:58 To the autistic eye
01:24:00 And two unicorns, two earth ponies
01:24:02 And two Pegasus high
01:24:04 Means there's this nice
01:24:06 Symmetry that's very pleasing
01:24:08 And it's really triggering my autism
01:24:10 That they changed it
01:24:12 I totally agree
01:24:14 If you read the
01:24:16 Very first analysis I ever wrote about MLP
01:24:18 My argument is essentially
01:24:20 That even though the show
01:24:22 Is all flash animation and stock stuff
01:24:24 That is the appeal
01:24:26 That it's so
01:24:28 Samey that it's such a clear
01:24:30 You can understand it
01:24:32 At a glance
01:24:34 And you can make your own
01:24:36 You can inject your own because it's so easy
01:24:38 It's such a template
01:24:40 It's so popular for autistic people
01:24:42 Because it's all
01:24:44 It's like
01:24:46 What the fuck
01:24:48 It's like you said
01:24:50 I'm seeing all the ones and zeros
01:24:52 In the show
01:24:54 When you look at the animation now
01:24:56 I think that's what we all kind of did
01:24:58 From the start
01:25:00 You like the ones and zeros
01:25:02 You want to play around with them
01:25:04 Autism programming
01:25:06 It's all a rich tapestry
01:25:08 We're all in the spectrum
01:25:10 It's all a rich tapestry that we use
01:25:12 To weave into a giant pressure blanket
01:25:14 That we use to get to sleep at night
01:25:16 I don't know if you guys feel the same way
01:25:18 But the locations in this movie
01:25:20 We're all fucking horrible
01:25:22 Like okay
01:25:24 And my little pony things are clean
01:25:26 And colorful
01:25:28 When they go to a completely generic
01:25:30 Dundadeth all one color
01:25:32 Brown sandy literal star war
01:25:34 Common fucking corporate
01:25:36 That's what they were going for
01:25:38 You know Munchy, I was really upset
01:25:40 Because
01:25:42 When they show that kingdom from the distance
01:25:44 It looks awesome
01:25:46 The image from a distance looks really cool
01:25:48 And I was excited because it made me think of how
01:25:50 The worst thing about
01:25:52 Episode one of season five
01:25:54 Was when they go to that town that just looks like
01:25:56 Shit, it's just nothing
01:25:58 And it was like the most unmemorable location
01:26:00 In the whole fucking show
01:26:02 And that had really bothered me at the time
01:26:04 Oh hey, it's like the art design that I expect from the show
01:26:06 And then they go there and it's just a generic
01:26:08 Um, yeah
01:26:10 Like bizarre and I was like oh it's one of these
01:26:12 It's all one color
01:26:14 It's all exactly one mid-tone color
01:26:16 You're not wrong
01:26:18 And even when they get to cool locations like the underwater area
01:26:20 And the last locations like that too
01:26:22 Well like the underwater location
01:26:24 The sea pony place sucked
01:26:26 Hold on
01:26:28 I'm talking about the top of the mountain
01:26:30 Was all gray
01:26:32 And then when they go and they're all sad
01:26:34 And they're like twilight, you're mean
01:26:36 And she's like yeah I am, it's all gray as well
01:26:38 It's all gray
01:26:40 That movie is weirdly gray
01:26:42 That is the trope of the breaking up the friend scene
01:26:44 Is that it's a gray place
01:26:46 Like if you watch all those Disney movies
01:26:48 It's always in a gray location
01:26:50 There was definitely an element
01:26:52 Of juxtaposing the pastelness
01:26:54 Of the ponies with like drabness
01:26:56 Of these other environments
01:26:58 Especially the ones outside of Equestria
01:27:00 All drab and it makes me want to die
01:27:02 Because it sucks
01:27:04 Wasn't the underwater place
01:27:06 Pretty cool
01:27:08 I don't know where the other one is
01:27:10 The throne room, you know
01:27:12 The throne room, not only is it that
01:27:14 It's just the throne room
01:27:16 But also that the throne room is literally copy-pasted
01:27:18 From the little mermaid
01:27:20 It's just the same place
01:27:22 Where's what you heard about the mermaid?
01:27:24 I liked the
01:27:26 The song montage done
01:27:28 When they were in the water place
01:27:30 Was enough to endear me to that place
01:27:32 I went to the bathroom to bring that song
01:27:34 Because I was sick of hearing songs
01:27:36 You watched the torrent
01:27:38 There's a pause button, what's wrong with you
01:27:40 No, I wanted to make
01:27:42 I wanted to not have to watch it
01:27:44 So I went, oh, they're singing
01:27:46 Great, let me get up and go get a drink
01:27:48 So that I don't have to watch it
01:27:50 Oh, that didgy brony
01:27:52 The integrity of all of your analysis work
01:27:54 Is now completely fucked
01:27:56 The word you say
01:27:58 You shouldn't have in the first place
01:28:00 I've never had integrity
01:28:02 That's why I put God's own channel
01:28:04 We've been glossing over
01:28:06 A part of the movie, which if you watched the trailer
01:28:08 You could have assumed it was a big part of the movie
01:28:10 But in actuality, it wasn't
01:28:12 That one celebrity appearance was literally completely meaningless
01:28:14 I was gonna bring that up
01:28:16 She only had like three lines
01:28:18 Literally just to trick people to see the movie
01:28:20 But it didn't work because I don't have no clue
01:28:22 She's just some Stacy
01:28:24 I like her hair
01:28:26 Okay, okay, her speaking voice
01:28:28 Her speaking voice is so soft
01:28:30 Genuine, you're not kidding anyone
01:28:32 We know you're mean, we know you're awful
01:28:34 Because you're a celebrity and they're all bad
01:28:36 We're not kidding anyone
01:28:38 We know you're bad, we know it
01:28:40 What she's famous for
01:28:42 Is that she's an anti-celebrity
01:28:44 No one knows what she looks like
01:28:46 She's like a hidden
01:28:48 She writes the biggest pop songs in the world
01:28:50 But she's never revealed herself
01:28:52 And nobody knows anything about her
01:28:54 Is that why her face was covered by all this hair
01:28:56 Yeah, that's actually what she looks like
01:28:58 In real life, she has the
01:29:00 Didn't you know the
01:29:02 Swinging on the chandelier song with the little girl who dances
01:29:04 And it's like the butterflies
01:29:06 Do you honestly think I have any connection
01:29:08 To pop culture beyond my little pony at all
01:29:10 Anybody know what the fuck this is
01:29:12 I watched the music video for
01:29:14 Tom, there's no way you haven't heard this song
01:29:16 Because it was like, I heard it
01:29:18 And I don't watch anything
01:29:20 Pop-related, but I don't know
01:29:22 You know way more about music than I do
01:29:24 Was it just like the ocean
01:29:26 Under the moon, you got the same
01:29:28 It was that
01:29:30 That's the one
01:29:32 That's Sia
01:29:34 I watched it
01:29:36 I watched certain that there was like a my little pony
01:29:38 Animation that allows this video
01:29:40 I watch Sia's cheap thrills music video
01:29:42 All the time because I love it
01:29:44 She's pretty cool
01:29:46 Wait, cheap thrills
01:29:48 Wait, cheap thrills
01:29:50 Up with it, girl
01:29:52 Yeah, it's that fucking really gay shit
01:29:54 I don't know
01:29:56 Okay, let's not get too hung up on this
01:29:58 The point is Sia was in it, she's a celebrity
01:30:00 She sang a song, she was a character, she was okay
01:30:02 I didn't care
01:30:04 She's actually a pony and that was her face
01:30:06 Oh, whoa
01:30:08 Wait, wait, wait, this is the canon Sia
01:30:10 This is the actual one in the movie
01:30:12 The human version, it's just an avatar
01:30:14 She's communicating with the real world
01:30:16 Maybe we're all just characters
01:30:18 In a show that the ponies are watching
01:30:20 You guys ever think about that
01:30:22 It's like the Simpsons game for Xbox 360
01:30:26 But Sia, she's in the movie for no reason
01:30:28 Other than at the end
01:30:30 They get to have the big concert
01:30:32 That's like, yeah, now we've resolved everything
01:30:34 The fight gets to be that MC
01:30:36 Cause that's what he does and it's good time
01:30:38 I did not like it, but
01:30:40 I didn't dislike it, but Cheese Sandwich
01:30:42 Makes a cameo in this episode
01:30:44 And it just made me remember how amazing that was
01:30:46 The Cheese Sandwich episode
01:30:48 That's the perfect way to do it
01:30:50 The point of the Sia character
01:30:52 The point of the Sia character
01:30:54 Is just so that's why I could have a thing
01:30:56 To talk about at the beginning, obviously
01:30:58 But I'm thinking, well, obviously
01:31:00 I thought immediately in the beginning of the movie
01:31:02 Well, at the end of the movie
01:31:04 Some sort of light show effect is going to happen
01:31:06 And it's going to be, well, not underwhelming
01:31:08 Cause I'm expecting it to be completely normal
01:31:10 And that's exactly what happened
01:31:12 Chip horn girl is like, I'm going to do
01:31:14 Fizzle Pop Man Twist
01:31:16 He does a fucking magic and I'm like, alright
01:31:18 It's going to be a firework, it's going to be totally normal
01:31:20 And everyone is going to act like it's exceptional
01:31:22 And they boop boop, totally normal effect
01:31:24 And I'm like, yup, okay, you guys did it
01:31:26 You guys had a couple years to make the movie
01:31:28 You could have like actually made something that was like really
01:31:30 Surprisingly artistic
01:31:32 Dude, they had, they had Trixie already
01:31:34 They could have used the fireworks
01:31:36 Yeah, they could have used the fireworks
01:31:38 This franchise has a long-stoyed history
01:31:40 Of ignoring Trixie's potential
01:31:42 And making new characters instead
01:31:44 That's literally what I said to my boyfriend
01:31:46 When we were watching, it was like
01:31:48 They could have just used Trixie for the fireworks
01:31:50 From the very beginning, Twilight could have
01:31:52 Just asked Trixie to do the fireworks
01:31:54 Trixie is in the movie
01:31:56 The name of the game in this movie is
01:31:58 Redundancy, right?
01:32:00 The name of this franchise is redundancy
01:32:02 I guess Twilight must have taken Trixie
01:32:04 Aside and been like, hey, I know
01:32:06 I know this was your bit, but just let
01:32:08 That Fizzle Pop have this, like she needs a victory
01:32:10 Right now, like
01:32:12 Dude, I would kill to have that seed
01:32:14 I could see that happening in the show
01:32:16 I could totally see like
01:32:18 Random background quality being asked
01:32:20 To step aside for someone else
01:32:22 That would totally happen in the show
01:32:24 And it would be hilarious
01:32:26 Speaking of scenes that were good
01:32:28 My favorite part of the episode was the Dr. Wolf reference
01:32:30 But other than that, my actual
01:32:32 Favorite bit in this movie
01:32:34 Was like, so there was
01:32:36 Twilight fucks everything up
01:32:38 The one who leads the charge
01:32:40 Telling her off and that she is fucked up
01:32:42 Is Pinkie Pie
01:32:44 Pinkie Pie actually filled
01:32:46 A leadership role in that position
01:32:48 As well as when they decide to go save Twilight
01:32:50 Because Pinkie is the one
01:32:52 That's because Pinkie
01:32:54 That's because Pinkie is the only written character
01:32:56 In the movie
01:32:58 It would have felt very strange
01:33:00 If Applejack, who makes more sense
01:33:02 To be in that position, suddenly had something
01:33:04 To do when she hasn't done anything
01:33:06 When you start up the movie, you have this giant box
01:33:08 Of conceits in a giant package of library
01:33:10 You got to accept all of them
01:33:12 All six of them are going to be there the whole time
01:33:14 And mostly it's not going to matter
01:33:16 That's just what it's for
01:33:18 That's the same thing that happens with all these adventures
01:33:20 That's always been a big problem
01:33:22 It's the Twilight show and her amazing friends
01:33:24 I think that there was space in this movie
01:33:26 To give them all something to do
01:33:28 Of course that could be
01:33:30 I think they gave
01:33:32 I think they gave
01:33:34 An exceptional amount of time to Pinkie Pie
01:33:36 Because she is the most popular character
01:33:38 With little girls and she's Pink
01:33:40 And that's what Hasbro wants
01:33:42 Guys, do you think
01:33:44 That in this situation of it being a movie
01:33:46 They could have
01:33:48 Permanently killed Fluttershy and Applejack
01:33:50 If they weren't going to use it
01:33:52 I was disappointed they didn't
01:33:54 They get caught in the crossfire
01:33:56 When the Thorn King falling
01:33:58 They do some sort of weird fusion
01:34:00 Applejack and Rainbow Dash become one character
01:34:02 And Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy
01:34:04 Also become one character
01:34:06 And the voice actors only have to
01:34:08 Have you ever noticed how
01:34:10 Rainbow Dash should have the element of honesty
01:34:12 And Applejack should have the element of honesty
01:34:14 Whoa
01:34:16 The blow in my mind
01:34:18 The elements are gone
01:34:20 Yeah, elements are irrelevant
01:34:22 They are gone
01:34:24 Did anyone else find it
01:34:26 Slightly amusing when
01:34:28 Rarity was like
01:34:30 I wasn't raising a barn
01:34:32 Sorry Applejack
01:34:34 I laughed at that joke
01:34:36 Okay, I guess there were two jokes
01:34:38 There were good jokes in the movie
01:34:40 Every joke in this movie
01:34:42 You just forgot because everything after the first
01:34:44 15 minutes
01:34:46 Those are the only two good ones
01:34:48 There was one joke that I found funny
01:34:50 It really surprised me that one moment
01:34:52 During the fight
01:34:54 Pinkie Pie
01:34:56 Gave a present
01:34:58 To one of the girls like surprise
01:35:00 And then he opens the box and she pops out
01:35:02 Double surprise
01:35:04 I wasn't terrible
01:35:06 I found it amusing
01:35:08 But then it's immediately ruined by the whole
01:35:10 Pinkie Pie throwing infinite cupcakes
01:35:12 With that stupid face on her face
01:35:14 I was fine
01:35:16 I liked when she threw the first cupcake
01:35:18 And they made it look like a blood splatter
01:35:20 On the wall behind him
01:35:22 See
01:35:24 There are good things in this movie
01:35:26 When the wind is whipping by
01:35:28 And the goons are getting hit with pies
01:35:30 It looks like they're being ripped apart
01:35:32 By shrapnel
01:35:34 The first thing I thought I was like
01:35:36 Holy shit
01:35:38 That's a very MLP thing to do
01:35:40 They've done shit like that
01:35:42 They always replicate
01:35:44 A serious movie but in a goofy fun
01:35:46 Kitty way
01:35:48 I have a very important question for everybody
01:35:50 Was this better than
01:35:52 Girls
01:35:54 Unequivocally
01:35:56 I don't know
01:35:58 How is this even a debate you guys question
01:36:00 But not better than Rainbow Rock
01:36:02 Just think back to that moment
01:36:04 At the end with the whole battle against demons
01:36:06 What's her face
01:36:08 Sunset
01:36:10 It was terrible
01:36:12 It was better than
01:36:14 Equestria Girls 1 but not as good as
01:36:16 Rainbow Rock
01:36:18 Can't they just both be undesirable
01:36:20 Yeah
01:36:22 So firstly I quite liked
01:36:24 The animation so I think
01:36:26 It's a lot better in the animation department
01:36:28 And cinematic stuff
01:36:30 I mean Equestria Girls looks like that
01:36:32 Writing wise
01:36:34 It's equally as bad
01:36:36 It's like the most basic fetch story
01:36:38 Quest without any sort of character arcs
01:36:40 In it and lots of stupid stuff
01:36:42 Just crammed in just for the sake of being there
01:36:44 It's such a poor writing
01:36:46 I completely agree
01:36:48 The fact that all the other
01:36:50 The songs
01:36:52 I think fail a lot more
01:36:54 Than any of the Equestria Girls songs
01:36:56 As much as I dislike some of them
01:36:58 They're at least earworms
01:37:00 And I quite enjoyed the villain songs
01:37:02 In most Equestria Girls movies
01:37:04 Which I mean in this one
01:37:06 Not so much I don't remember it as
01:37:08 Quite as well as the any other ones
01:37:10 I'm definitely not good at
01:37:12 Equestria Girls Rainbow Rocks songs
01:37:14 Were not the right type
01:37:16 Of rock music
01:37:18 There's not enough
01:37:20 I never saw
01:37:22 The other Equestria Girls movies
01:37:24 But based on
01:37:26 There's only two right?
01:37:28 There's a bunch of them now
01:37:30 They make one every year
01:37:32 The third one's bad
01:37:34 The second one's kinda good
01:37:36 The fourth one is like
01:37:38 In the camp
01:37:40 In like a
01:37:42 Concentration camp
01:37:44 I remember
01:37:46 I remember being
01:37:48 The guy who defended Equestria Girls
01:37:50 You fool
01:37:52 Pretty colors dude
01:37:54 Pretty colors now
01:37:56 I definitely regret
01:37:58 My position
01:38:00 I'm glad the history shows
01:38:02 I was right the entire time
01:38:04 Mostly because the movie
01:38:06 Is so insanely ugly
01:38:08 That I cannot look at it anymore
01:38:10 And I don't know the visuals
01:38:12 I just realized that
01:38:14 I don't know
01:38:16 I can't even look at the show anymore
01:38:18 I don't like
01:38:20 My little pony friendship
01:38:22 Can we talk about that for a second?
01:38:24 That's a point that I was struggling going through
01:38:26 The entire time watching this movie
01:38:28 And up to this podcast was that
01:38:30 I was trying to think of like
01:38:32 How do I enjoy this movie now
01:38:34 Versus how would I have enjoyed this movie
01:38:36 If it actually came out like six months after they announced it
01:38:38 Because this whole time
01:38:40 Experience in the fandom
01:38:42 From 2012 to like
01:38:44 2014 or 15 or whatever
01:38:46 I never understood why
01:38:48 I liked the show to begin with
01:38:50 I could never really quantify it in a way that made sense to me
01:38:52 And when I got out of it
01:38:54 I could never understand
01:38:56 How I even got so obsessed with it in the first place
01:38:58 Like it just feels
01:39:00 So weird to think about
01:39:02 How I even did that so much
01:39:04 I don't regret it
01:39:06 But I just feel like
01:39:08 The show is more than I loved MLP
01:39:10 And I never got into them to such a degree
01:39:12 I'm glad I did because I never would have met any of you guys
01:39:14 It was the power of the zeitgeist
01:39:16 Man, it was the fan
01:39:18 It was how active and fervent the fan base was
01:39:20 I got into it
01:39:22 Through the Newgrounds Game Story of the Blank
01:39:24 That was my first exposure and it really impressed me
01:39:26 Dude, I know
01:39:28 Guys, I know the exact
01:39:30 Date I got in MLP
01:39:32 For one specific reason
01:39:34 9-11, 2000
01:39:36 I got in MLP
01:39:38 I got into MLP
01:39:40 On August 10th, 2011
01:39:42 And I know that for a fact
01:39:44 Because that's the date
01:39:46 The Know Your Meme on My Little Pony came out
01:39:48 And that's how I found out about it
01:39:50 And much of it was refreshing that page fervently
01:39:52 Waiting for new memes to drop on that page
01:39:54 I got into it by my friend who was trying to get me into it
01:39:56 Showing me Captain Hook the Biker Gorilla
01:39:58 Rainbow Dash presents
01:40:00 With all these fucking loses
01:40:02 And I was like, that is my introduction to MLP
01:40:04 The most confusing thing ever
01:40:06 But I was literally sold on watching the show
01:40:08 Simply by virtue of witnessing how much effort
01:40:10 Would be put into a fan work
01:40:12 I thought, well, the show must be striking
01:40:14 Some sort of really deep chord
01:40:16 With some pretty deep specs going on
01:40:18 That's how I feel, definitely
01:40:20 I got into the show through TF2 analysis
01:40:22 Okay, since we got totally filmed again
01:40:24 Here's a question then
01:40:26 Do you think that none of us were
01:40:28 Do you think we were all just tangentially fans of MLP
01:40:30 And we're all fans of the MLP fandom
01:40:32 I will say this
01:40:34 The fandom wasn't even there when I started watching it
01:40:36 No, my enjoyment of MLP
01:40:38 Was sincere at many points
01:40:40 Yeah, no, I think there's a lot of good stuff
01:40:42 About the show
01:40:44 And it's a matter of
01:40:46 I didn't get into it immediately
01:40:48 I watched all of Season 1
01:40:50 And thought it was okay
01:40:52 It was Season 2
01:40:54 And I started involving myself in the fandom
01:40:56 And it was more like
01:40:58 Finding the good
01:41:00 The nuggets of gold was what was exciting
01:41:02 About it
01:41:04 Looking deep into it
01:41:06 And saying, oh wow, when you really think about it
01:41:08 That's an interesting idea
01:41:10 And so it was the analysis
01:41:12 That made me love the show so much
01:41:14 But then when you're not trying
01:41:16 To find all the great stuff
01:41:18 In it and you're just looking at what it is
01:41:20 I realized
01:41:22 That I got to a point with the show
01:41:24 Where I didn't start paying attention
01:41:26 Until three minutes into the episode
01:41:28 It starts
01:41:30 Like on my little pony episode
01:41:32 Opens with just characters describing
01:41:34 What the plot is going to be
01:41:36 For minutes on end, usually
01:41:38 I recently tried to go back
01:41:40 And watch Apple Buck Season
01:41:42 Because it was my favorite episode
01:41:44 And the whole opening segment is just
01:41:46 Big MacTosh going, you can't possibly
01:41:48 Get all these apples
01:41:50 And she's like, well, I can try to
01:41:52 And I'm like, oh okay
01:41:54 I don't need any of it
01:41:56 And I'm like, what's your favorite episode?
01:41:58 Huh? What are you saying?
01:42:00 Because you always said that's my favorite episode
01:42:02 But all your videos on it were like
01:42:04 I like it, eh, eh
01:42:06 And I was like, who had the best jokes?
01:42:08 That's why I liked it so much
01:42:10 It has by far the funniest jokes in the show
01:42:12 Okay, you're a good, you're a dry humor
01:42:14 I felt for a long time
01:42:16 Like certain members of this group
01:42:18 Lay it down for it, Keg, lay it on
01:42:20 A few members of this group
01:42:22 To me really seem to be making
01:42:24 Just actually reflective of their
01:42:26 Of their heart of heart opinions
01:42:28 Of the show and an attempt to distance themselves
01:42:30 And I get that
01:42:32 Some people might legitimately have been caught in the zeitgeist
01:42:34 And really now, they don't really care as much
01:42:36 I was probably
01:42:38 One of the most
01:42:40 Maybe, I was one of the most
01:42:42 Strident in my desire to remove myself completely
01:42:44 From the pony shit
01:42:46 Just not talk about it all, do my own thing
01:42:48 And just never reverence it or whatever
01:42:50 And that was only because I just didn't want
01:42:52 The same, like, perception of who I was
01:42:54 And, and, like, that fandom
01:42:56 Into my new shit, I just wanted to start new
01:42:58 And that's fine, but I am happy to admit
01:43:00 I go back and watch episodes of My Little Pony
01:43:02 All the time
01:43:04 Especially the, uh, the Diamond Tera episode
01:43:06 Is, is one of my favorite episodes
01:43:08 Of anything ever
01:43:10 And that's up against every episode of
01:43:12 Gurren Lagann, every episode of Stand Alone Complex
01:43:14 Every fucking episode of Fooly Coolie
01:43:16 It is one of my favorite episodes
01:43:18 Of anything I've ever seen in my life
01:43:20 Having seen it recently
01:43:22 It's really difficult, the thing is
01:43:24 My tastes have changed considerably
01:43:26 Since that time, like, when I went
01:43:28 Into My Little Pony, I came into it from
01:43:30 Having been somebody who was, like,
01:43:32 Literally anti-plot
01:43:34 Like, I thought that plot
01:43:36 Oh, you weren't anti-plot anymore, though
01:43:38 You're giving me that animation, I'm so much
01:43:40 Ammunition right now
01:43:42 Everybody knows this, I've said this a million times
01:43:44 I was literally, I did not think
01:43:46 I mean, I still feel that way, but, like
01:43:48 I literally thought that plot does not matter
01:43:50 And is stupid, like, when I was
01:43:52 Younger, I thought plot is
01:43:54 The least interesting thing about a show
01:43:56 And should not be paid attention to
01:43:58 All I care about is the characters
01:44:00 And watching them interact, all I watched
01:44:02 Was, like, cute girl shows and, like, magical
01:44:04 Girl shit, you know, like, and that's what
01:44:06 MLP was to me, was, like, a perfect
01:44:08 Representation of what I was interested in
01:44:10 But after MLP, really
01:44:12 At some point during the show, I got
01:44:14 Interested in plot-driven stuff
01:44:16 You know, through, like, Mass Effect
01:44:18 And then
01:44:20 I got really into sci-fi
01:44:22 And cyberpunk, and, like, if you look at what
01:44:24 I was watching immediately after MLP
01:44:26 It was all cyberpunk animation
01:44:28 That's interesting that you say Mass Effect got you into
01:44:30 Plot-driven stuff, because I don't know
01:44:32 I was way more into the characters than the plot
01:44:34 Well, yeah, that's how it got me in
01:44:36 After Mass Effect won, the plot was retarded
01:44:38 Okay, sure, but
01:44:40 What I'm saying is that it got me interested in, like,
01:44:42 World-building and, like, all these high-concept
01:44:44 Shit, like, I hated sci-fi
01:44:46 And I hated politics before Mass Effect
01:44:48 And now those are my two favorite jobs
01:44:50 I still want to do a Mass Effect podcast at some point
01:44:52 So, like, in the wake of MLP
01:44:54 The stuff I got interested in is, like
01:44:56 I don't know, I have, like, a much more adult
01:44:58 Taste, I guess, than I did even at the time
01:45:00 Like, MLP
01:45:02 MLP was indicative of the taste
01:45:04 I had at the time, and it is not now
01:45:06 And going back to watch it, it's really
01:45:08 Difficult to get through all the child-proofing
01:45:10 All of the, like, I, you know
01:45:12 All I want to say is people seem to forget
01:45:14 That there are episodes, like, putting your foot down
01:45:16 In my little pony
01:45:18 What the fuck is a foot?
01:45:20 What the fuck is a foot?
01:45:22 Putting your hoof down, and how many fucking
01:45:24 Shows, at period, have addressed, like,
01:45:26 Assertiveness training seminars
01:45:28 Or, like, pick up culture
01:45:30 Or any of that kind of, like, like, nobody even
01:45:32 Wants to talk or think about that shit
01:45:34 Like, it takes weird-ass movies like Magnolia
01:45:36 To even bring up the idea of that kind of shit
01:45:38 And yet my fucking little pony
01:45:40 Makes an episode about it
01:45:42 I will never forget, I will never
01:45:44 End giving credit to that show
01:45:46 For making that shit part of an episode
01:45:48 I totally think it deserves, it deserves the credit
01:45:50 You know, I really, I really like, there's
01:45:52 Tons of, I still like suit of recess
01:45:54 I still think it's fucking fantastic
01:45:56 I still have all my favorites
01:45:58 I just, what I, it's weird
01:46:00 Because I don't understand, really, how
01:46:02 I got so obsessed with it, because I'd never participated
01:46:04 In a fandom at all, and never had any desire to
01:46:06 But now that I'm on the outside
01:46:08 I just have this weird feeling of awkwardness
01:46:10 Because, despite the fact that
01:46:12 I don't regret participating as much
01:46:14 As I did, like, I'm back to
01:46:16 Where I was before, and, like, I would never
01:46:18 Put that much time and effort into something
01:46:20 Like that
01:46:22 I will happily say that I was a bronie
01:46:24 And I will happily say
01:46:26 I met all of you people doing Mylepony
01:46:28 It was an incredibly great thing
01:46:30 That happened to me
01:46:32 Oh, absolutely
01:46:34 We will forever
01:46:36 I will just say, that was all
01:46:38 Things about the fandom that I enjoyed
01:46:40 And the sense of community that I felt when I was
01:46:42 In the bronie fandom, though embarrassing to say
01:46:44 Was pretty great, and there are a lot of things
01:46:46 I like about Mylepony itself
01:46:48 However, like, I don't know
01:46:50 Things change, bro
01:46:52 Things change
01:46:54 Things change, but sometimes we have to
01:46:56 Hashtag we have to go back
01:46:58 That's one of those sides
01:47:00 You grow up in your taste change, but also like
01:47:02 I mean, maybe it was always there
01:47:04 And I just wasn't seeing it, but, you know, at some point
01:47:06 At some point the tone shifted
01:47:08 And it became important to me personally
01:47:10 To get away from it
01:47:12 So as not to be lumped in with people like
01:47:14 KP and Dr. Wolf
01:47:16 It was important to my personal sense of identity
01:47:18 That I not be one of those
01:47:20 I feel like this is being like a big deal
01:47:22 Like, for us
01:47:24 Because, like, the bronie thing
01:47:26 Was such a big thing
01:47:28 It's a show that, you know
01:47:30 We liked it at a time, and now we don't
01:47:32 As much
01:47:34 There are other shows and games and things
01:47:36 That I have gotten into and then gone out
01:47:38 Of liking
01:47:40 And then maybe years later, I'm like
01:47:42 You know what, I might go and check that out again
01:47:44 It's not really any different
01:47:46 But the reason is like
01:47:48 We're making a big deal out of it because it was a fandom
01:47:50 Exactly
01:47:52 Mylepony is like your first girlfriend
01:47:54 Yeah, you'll date other girls
01:47:56 But you don't give a fuck about them
01:47:58 You only care about the original one
01:48:00 I always only care about her and want her forever
01:48:02 For me, with MLP
01:48:04 That's how it is
01:48:06 The thing that makes it weird is just that
01:48:08 It was the first show I ever had
01:48:10 Shout out to my girlfriend, by the way
01:48:16 Get fucked, Michelle
01:48:26 At the time that Mylepony came out
01:48:28 I was really grappling with the fact that
01:48:30 I didn't have a favorite show
01:48:32 I loved animated death
01:48:34 But I never had one thing
01:48:36 That I was like, this is my favorite
01:48:38 And MLP became that
01:48:40 And I think just
01:48:42 A lot of my love for the show was just
01:48:44 That I loved the show
01:48:46 Therefore I performed that
01:48:48 It's like a
01:48:50 Or a boros, you keep doing it
01:48:52 Because you say you do it
01:48:54 And then that keeps happening
01:48:56 And once you break out of that
01:48:58 Then it's like, okay, now that I've lost that
01:49:00 Now that I've lost the idea of
01:49:02 DigiBronie, you know
01:49:04 What is left
01:49:06 I just think that perhaps
01:49:08 I approached this whole thing
01:49:10 Because Ben and I never ever called ourselves
01:49:12 Bronies And especially I felt like that was part of
01:49:14 What I did
01:49:16 I really enjoyed the show
01:49:18 But I never really involved myself with anyone
01:49:20 Except people who were already cool people
01:49:22 Like all of the people here right now
01:49:24 They only associated with those people
01:49:26 Ben and I never liked at all any of that rift shit
01:49:28 Any of those other people
01:49:30 They were always trash and you could tell instantly
01:49:32 Except for Ben who loved it and was in TF2
01:49:34 And now his anarchy
01:49:36 My proudest moment
01:49:38 The height of my career
01:49:40 I figured out
01:49:42 Why I like my little pony
01:49:44 I figured it out
01:49:46 And you guys are gonna feel real fucking old
01:49:48 Because I was thinking about it
01:49:50 And the reason I like my little pony
01:49:52 I was thinking about it
01:49:54 It came on August 10th, 2011
01:49:56 I was born
01:49:58 I was
01:50:00 I got into it on August 10th, 2011
01:50:02 I was literally 10
01:50:04 I was literally 10
01:50:06 I was literally 10 years old
01:50:10 I was like what
01:50:12 2022
01:50:14 When I got into it
01:50:16 You admit older than that Ben
01:50:18 You're like 90
01:50:20 I've aged like 70 years
01:50:22 I was 22
01:50:24 Leaving the
01:50:26 Leaving the brony fan and really takes a toll
01:50:28 On your soul
01:50:30 That's probably why I liked it
01:50:32 Because I was a baby
01:50:34 The rest of us have no excuse
01:50:36 No excuse basically
01:50:38 I see
01:50:40 You get involved
01:50:42 Heavily enough and something like that
01:50:44 And it becomes a part of who you are
01:50:46 I know exactly why I liked it
01:50:48 It's the art style
01:50:50 It's very simple and cute and pastel colored
01:50:52 It's all the things I like
01:50:54 You're a girl so you're allowed to feel that way
01:50:56 I fell in love with it
01:50:58 I really fell in love with the show
01:51:00 When the winter wrap-up song played
01:51:02 Because I fucking love musicals
01:51:04 And I will watch any show that has music in it
01:51:06 God I just want to be a musical man forever
01:51:08 It's a great song
01:51:10 The thing that makes it unique is that
01:51:12 It is the cheap, chintzy, 5 year old girl's show
01:51:14 But done competently
01:51:16 Sometimes it's great
01:51:18 So you kind of sign waves right around
01:51:20 In the pretty good zone
01:51:22 And I believe I'm looking around
01:51:24 When it comes to western shows
01:51:26 With some poppy animation for girls
01:51:28 It's still probably the best one
01:51:30 And that has a unique position
01:51:32 And if you're going through a certain dark part of your life
01:51:34 Having something like that could be just the right thing
01:51:36 To pick you up and make you happy
01:51:38 And it's more of a time in place thing
01:51:40 And slap you down
01:51:42 For me it was definitely a
01:51:44 New thing and seeing all the world building
01:51:46 And just experiencing it for the first time
01:51:48 It's a great experience
01:51:50 And it was a great way to inspire lots of people
01:51:52 To make the fandom
01:51:54 People say, oh people just stuck it into the fandom
01:51:56 Well, the fandom became the kind of fandom that it was
01:51:58 Because of what the show inspired in them
01:52:00 And that just dragged it out
01:52:02 I feel like...
01:52:04 Everyone of us here who was inspired to create art
01:52:06 Through the My Little Pony
01:52:08 Analysis community or whatever it was
01:52:10 I feel like we all had that within us
01:52:12 Of course, that
01:52:14 Ability was inside all of us to go do the kind of thing
01:52:16 But I am just so grateful for the show
01:52:18 To being the vehicle that helped me develop it
01:52:20 I am such
01:52:22 Gratitude for it
01:52:24 I have nothing but respect for the show
01:52:26 And I will defend it
01:52:28 Because I don't want to look like
01:52:30 A fucking idiot for having like that
01:52:32 I really thought you were going somewhere else with that
01:52:34 Yeah, me too
01:52:36 Yeah, no
01:52:38 By the way, how long is this going to go?
01:52:40 I think we'll book this with a podcast with that anime snob
01:52:42 Whoa!
01:52:44 We're going to do just for that anime snob
01:52:46 This is
01:52:48 Jesus fucking crazy
01:52:50 How fucking telling is that?
01:52:52 The Digi Brony is betraying us
01:52:54 You're fucking anime snob
01:52:56 At least just bring him in
01:52:58 Bring him in
01:53:00 It's with the
01:53:02 Pause and select and all that
01:53:04 I'll make them wait
01:53:06 We're going a while longer
01:53:08 I feel similarly about like
01:53:10 The show giving me the confidence
01:53:12 To make stuff
01:53:14 Because I always wanted to make gaming videos
01:53:16 But I feel like if I had just
01:53:18 Like if I hadn't been
01:53:20 Part of the pony community and met anybody
01:53:22 Doing reviews and
01:53:24 Had a chance to test
01:53:26 You know my abilities
01:53:28 I probably would have ended up as like
01:53:30 I don't know, a cadichorus or someone worse than me
01:53:32 Like someone just okay
01:53:34 Not hundreds of thousands of subscribers
01:53:36 I honestly think
01:53:38 I'm not a subscriber cad
01:53:40 I think I would just not be as where I am
01:53:42 If I didn't have the community
01:53:44 He happened in the fires of the
01:53:46 Brony fanaticism
01:53:48 In the Brony sphere, think of it like a fucking tea tree
01:53:50 And there was one specific chemical
01:53:52 That all of us had that attracted us together
01:53:54 And then we forged our bond
01:53:56 In that realm and we had this
01:53:58 Ideological synchronization
01:54:00 That we're still riding on this time
01:54:02 I wasn't doing analysis videos at the time
01:54:04 I was following all of you pretty closely
01:54:06 Or at least some of you pretty closely
01:54:08 I never would have done anything youtube related
01:54:10 If I hadn't gotten dragged into this shit storm
01:54:12 So I'm grateful that
01:54:14 I was able to expand as a creator
01:54:16 Do more things and I definitely
01:54:18 Gained more confidence, more skills
01:54:20 And I have a ton of things that I've done
01:54:22 And can do now that I never would have been able to otherwise
01:54:24 So that was all pretty fun
01:54:26 I'm extremely grateful to the
01:54:28 Brony community for
01:54:30 Allowing me to take advantage of them
01:54:32 And launch my career
01:54:34 I would not, it was a very small pond
01:54:36 That I was able to be a big fish in
01:54:38 By being smarter than everybody else
01:54:40 Involved with it
01:54:42 You know
01:54:44 That's the Brony way
01:54:46 When I made my first Brony video
01:54:48 I told my friend Ghost Lightning
01:54:50 I can probably gain
01:54:52 Enough subscribers from this
01:54:54 That once I switch to doing games analysis
01:54:56 I'll have an audience
01:54:58 And that worked
01:55:00 And it was great because imagine if that hadn't happened
01:55:02 That would mean that now sitting
01:55:04 Pretty today in 2017 you'd have to look at the first year
01:55:06 And a half of your career making like
01:55:08 Video game and anime videos
01:55:10 And it's like you know that a lot of people would
01:55:12 Get curious and watch them and you'd be like
01:55:14 Don't but thankfully since they're all pony
01:55:16 No one's gonna go see them so you don't have to deal
01:55:18 With people seeing them
01:55:20 No one ever goes back to my like
01:55:22 The earliest videos that anybody will watch from me
01:55:24 Are already pretty good because I cut my teeth
01:55:26 On this other bullshit that nobody wants
01:55:28 To be involved with unless they already were
01:55:30 You can downplay your personal
01:55:32 Investment in this all you want did you
01:55:34 No no no I'm not downplaying anything
01:55:36 I'm just saying that my fans will
01:55:38 Not go watch those videos
01:55:40 And those videos are much worse than what I do
01:55:42 Now because I cut my teeth on them
01:55:44 Like I learned how to make videos
01:55:46 By doing pony analysis
01:55:48 When I watch sometimes I go back and watch those
01:55:50 It's really fucking hard to watch them
01:55:52 I think it's funny that
01:55:54 Digi Brony is using a teeth
01:55:56 I know I was thinking about that
01:55:58 I'm thankful
01:56:00 For the Brony community because BronyCon
01:56:02 What was it 2015 I think
01:56:04 Yeah I think so
01:56:06 The second year we were all there together
01:56:08 It was probably the best convention of my entire life
01:56:10 And I'm so glad I'm in all of you
01:56:12 And I'm really happy
01:56:14 That was really great
01:56:16 My favorite moment
01:56:18 In this movie is the first time
01:56:20 Celestia was on screen and I was said to my girlfriend
01:56:22 That's the voice actress I almost punched
01:56:24 In the face
01:56:26 Bitch
01:56:28 By the way hippo
01:56:30 I just want to say
01:56:32 I need you to apologize for my little pony
01:56:34 Right now you're a brick and I don't want to have to place you down
01:56:36 I don't want to have to place you down hippo
01:56:38 Please apologize for my little pony
01:56:40 I will never ever apologize
01:56:42 I'll leave you alone
01:56:44 I'm gonna have to push you down
01:56:46 I'm gonna have to push you down
01:56:48 It's just how it's gonna be
01:56:50 On record right now
01:56:52 I'm 10 to 15 minutes
01:56:54 I'm gonna push you down
01:56:56 She should have been the main character in this movie
01:56:58 If she was the main character then I would be screaming
01:57:00 I just want to say that we've had
01:57:02 We've had a real helpful discussion
01:57:04 A real nuanced discussion
01:57:06 About the pros and cons and the thing we like and dislike
01:57:08 And what it all meant to us
01:57:10 But I would like to just throw all that right out the window
01:57:12 Because I don't know about you guys
01:57:14 But I've had a couple too many diet code red
01:57:16 Mountain Dews and I gotta take a piss
01:57:18 And I'm gonna fucking do it
01:57:20 I'm gonna fucking take a piss on the movie
01:57:22 I'm gonna take a piss on the bronies
01:57:24 And I'm gonna take a piss
01:57:26 On everyone in the world
01:57:28 Can I personally say what
01:57:30 I'm literally sorry
01:57:32 I have to leave right now
01:57:34 Because that's why we scheduled this earlier
01:57:36 So that he could leave
01:57:38 Also I have double booked a podcast
01:57:40 I guess that's the way the wind is blowing
01:57:42 No, you don't understand
01:57:44 I'm peeing right now
01:57:46 Ben you wanna pee with me
01:57:48 You're my best friend
01:57:50 Strawberry milk and phantom horn
01:57:54 Strawberry milk and phantom horn
01:57:56 We're hitting on the MLP movie
01:57:58 Bloody fuckers, calculers, we're paying for a thousand years
01:58:04 I hear it
01:58:06 This is the best ASMR
01:58:08 Yeah, this should have been the ASMR cast
01:58:10 Oh wow, here we go
01:58:12 Do you wanna make your point?
01:58:14 I wanna say what I'm power
01:58:16 I love power
01:58:18 It's too much, it's overflowing
01:58:20 Get a new bottle, get a new bottle
01:58:22 I'm holding it in
01:58:24 Please at least stop talking
01:58:26 Fuck me, fuck unicorn
01:58:28 Fuck alicorn
01:58:30 Everything that ever was or ever will be
01:58:32 In the holy land of equestria
01:58:34 You're all pee
01:58:36 You're all pee now
01:58:38 Go ahead
01:58:40 You're so gross
01:58:42 I know
01:58:44 Well, now I can
01:58:46 I don't wanna be honest and stuff like that
01:58:48 Now that they're peeing
01:58:56 So liberating
01:58:58 I feel like we don't need to do questions
01:59:00 Jesus Christ
01:59:02 You guys can do questions after me and once you leave
01:59:04 Oh yeah, okay, bye
01:59:06 Bye, bye
01:59:08 You're leaving
01:59:10 Alright, we'll just say
01:59:12 Let's do a handful
01:59:14 I don't fucking know
01:59:16 Yep
01:59:18 I was just wondering who's leaving and why
01:59:20 Munchie's leaving because he has to go on a trip immediately
01:59:22 Like that's why we had to do this at two
01:59:24 Okay, understood
01:59:26 Go to it, people have to leave
01:59:28 Goodbye
01:59:30 Munchie get the fuck out of the car
01:59:32 I'm sorry
01:59:34 He was peed after he left
01:59:36 Yeah
01:59:38 I wanted him here
01:59:40 You want to make your point
01:59:42 The mood is run though
01:59:44 Okay, tell you what
01:59:46 We'll come back to that after some questions
01:59:48 Yeah, I want to answer at least one question
01:59:50 Before we all fucking
01:59:52 Before I take off to go talk to
01:59:54 Snob or whatever
01:59:56 Munchie was actually the one looking at the discord
01:59:58 If somebody else wants to pull that up
02:00:00 I'll take a look at it
02:00:02 Okay, cool
02:00:04 What do we got here?
02:00:06 No, that's shit, that's terrible
02:00:08 I don't know
02:00:10 At draw fill draw asks
02:00:12 Will there ever be a hashtag dad con
02:00:14 I guess where our dads go to a convention
02:00:16 I would assume
02:00:18 We'll have that con once Munchie steals all the dads
02:00:20 Yeah
02:00:22 We'll put them all in a bunker together
02:00:24 I'll send my dad along
02:00:26 In a package
02:00:28 Have we ever answered
02:00:30 Do you plan on having children?
02:00:32 I don't know
02:00:34 I think we might have on some sort of a podcast
02:00:36 I think on like a really earlier podcast
02:00:38 I definitely intend on having children
02:00:40 No, we have answered this
02:00:42 Because Nate gave us this whole rundown
02:00:44 Of what his kids are going to be
02:00:46 That's right, I did
02:00:48 Vincent and Charlotte, yep, that's right
02:00:50 I will never have children
02:00:52 I think it's retarded
02:00:54 I'm way too selfish
02:00:56 I would sacrifice my children
02:00:58 At the first possible opportunity
02:01:00 To advance myself
02:01:02 I've heard you talk about that too
02:01:04 I don't know what a child is
02:01:06 But I plan to have fillies
02:01:08 That's good
02:01:10 Because I'm still
02:01:12 Give us another question
02:01:14 I'm not finding any I want to read out
02:01:18 I'll just quickly answer the question while you're finding the thing
02:01:20 Sure, go for it
02:01:22 I don't particularly want any at this current time
02:01:24 Maybe in the future
02:01:26 But highly, I doubt it very highly
02:01:28 Don't like children
02:01:30 I agree, Paige
02:01:32 Well
02:01:34 In the Patreon chat
02:01:36 Crafty asks how long do you take to pee
02:01:38 And we just answered that live
02:01:40 You've got that on right here
02:01:42 Ascan asks
02:01:44 The biggest let down you've ever experienced
02:01:46 The My Little Pony movie
02:01:48 Yeah
02:01:50 Oh guys, guys, guys
02:01:52 When I said I don't like children
02:01:54 My cat mealed and came up to me and I was snuggling me
02:01:56 Yes, he is my child, I like you
02:01:58 Yes, they're good
02:02:00 We can control them and bend them to our will
02:02:02 Here's an actually great question
02:02:04 El Gringo Bandito
02:02:06 asks what's your favorite sword
02:02:10 That's a good question
02:02:12 I like a good bastard sword
02:02:14 A big
02:02:16 Hilt bastard sword
02:02:18 I just like bastard because then I could say it in class
02:02:20 And the teacher would be like I could say bastard
02:02:22 A pokey sword
02:02:24 I really don't know anything about swords
02:02:26 The one that does its job
02:02:28 No
02:02:30 That's like the weakest one
02:02:32 Folded a thousand times
02:02:34 Catanas are
02:02:36 Pretty cool though
02:02:38 Eek
02:02:40 Real
02:02:42 They cut the weak western steel
02:02:44 Are you kidding me?
02:02:46 My favorite sword is a specific answer
02:02:48 I like Stormbringer
02:02:50 It's a sword from the Eternal Champion Saga
02:02:52 The Elric Saga, it's pretty cool
02:02:54 It's a sword all made of black
02:02:56 Red runes etched into it
02:02:58 And with the sword it works
02:03:00 If you get cut by it, it steals your soul
02:03:02 And it's fucking awesome
02:03:04 The Storm King could have used that
02:03:06 It was funny
02:03:08 I was trying to remember the Storm King's name
02:03:10 And all I could think of was Stormbringer
02:03:12 I'm like it's not Stormbringer, he's not that cool
02:03:14 Fuck that shit
02:03:16 It's simple, but I've always really loved the Buster Sword
02:03:18 What can I say, the Buster Sword is dope
02:03:20 When I was younger I liked
02:03:22 The more ornately designed swords
02:03:24 But now I like big, simple
02:03:26 I really like a Sonosuke
02:03:28 Sagaura sword from Ruroni Kenshin
02:03:30 That he uses one time
02:03:32 Before he does
02:03:34 Fist of Cuffs
02:03:36 And also this
02:03:38 Zvihander from Dark Souls
02:03:40 It's kind of like a bastard sword
02:03:42 It's not from Dark Souls, it's from real life
02:03:44 That's a real sword
02:03:46 I like it because of Dark Souls
02:03:48 I think maybe my favorite sword is one of Zolo's
02:03:50 swords
02:03:52 You call them Zolo
02:03:54 I grew up calling him Zolo
02:03:56 One of Zoro's sword
02:03:58 Which one?
02:04:00 I really like the blue one
02:04:02 It's not even his best one
02:04:04 That's the cursed one, right?
02:04:06 No, no, it's one he gets later
02:04:08 As a replacement for one that breaks
02:04:10 Someone gives it to him
02:04:12 Because it's the best one they got lying around
02:04:14 Oh, that's really early
02:04:16 With the black sheath
02:04:18 The cursed one with the weird
02:04:20 Wavy pattern
02:04:22 In the cut of it
02:04:24 I really fucking love
02:04:26 Zoro's sword
02:04:28 And tragically, that one you're talking about right now
02:04:30 Is destroyed by a man with rust powers
02:04:32 And gets replaced later on
02:04:34 The blue one does?
02:04:36 That's right
02:04:38 But I liked it because
02:04:40 It wasn't like some Mary Sue sword
02:04:42 It wasn't like the best sword ever
02:04:44 It was an excellent sword
02:04:46 That someone gave to him because they felt he deserved it
02:04:48 And it fucking died
02:04:50 It suffered a tragic end
02:04:52 But it looked really cool
02:04:54 Zoro's swords have great backstories
02:04:56 Especially because the one he gets later to replace it
02:04:58 Is actually a sword used by this guy
02:05:00 Who was in one of Oda's previous works
02:05:02 About a fucking dragon slaying samurai guy
02:05:04 That's the dopest thing ever
02:05:06 None of the other questions are interesting to me
02:05:08 So I'm going to take off
02:05:10 You guys can keep answering it
02:05:12 Okay, peace dog
02:05:14 Bye, didgybrony

02:05:18 Tell us a tall tale, why don't you
02:05:20 I got a question from the PCP chat
02:05:22 It could be interesting
02:05:24 If the PCP were to form a band of any genre
02:05:26 What would the roles for each member be
02:05:28 And what would the first album be called
02:05:30 The album would definitely be gay and dead
02:05:32 Absolutely
02:05:34 Gay and dead too
02:05:36 I would be guitar boy
02:05:38 I want to be the designated band
02:05:40 Scatman
02:05:42 That would be what I would do
02:05:44 That would be what I would do
02:05:46 I don't know
02:05:48 Bye
02:05:50 Okay, I'm not down for this trickling away
02:05:52 We would instantly kick Davoo out of the band
02:05:54 Okay, let's

02:07:00 Is on iTunes and on Google Play
02:07:02 Just to alleviate some confusion

02:07:06 Even though it's technically on Google Play
02:07:08 You have to go to the Google Play Music app
02:07:10 On your phone, not the Google Play store
02:07:12 It's really retarded, I don't know why it's that way
