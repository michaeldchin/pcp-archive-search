00:00:00 Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:08 BG and we got BS over there. The shitter himself. We got TO. What's up, T?
00:00:19 Yo. Yeah, his catchphrase. Yo, we got GT.
00:00:26 Lord of Ghost Chapter 5 will be out by the time you're listening to this. Always
00:00:31 pushing that L, O, G, and D.B. Yo, I'm sorry I've not been on the show for a long
00:00:38 time. I was spent a long six weeks trying to figure out exactly how gay I
00:00:43 actually am. Results? Any closer? Very gay, it turns out. Extremely excessively
00:00:49 gayer than I ever thought possible, so now I have to live that life for the rest
00:00:54 of my life. I want to say, first thing, today, when this is coming out, this
00:01:01 will be the last day that the Rowdy Frickers Cop Killers Pin Kickstarter is on and
00:01:07 we will be streaming the end of the Kickstarter on twitch.tv slash Rowdy
00:01:10 Frickers Cop Killers tonight. This is the big finale. We've achieved, we've
00:01:18 outdone all of our expectations, as always. That's great, that's great. You
00:01:23 guys, you do that and here's some incentive. I forgot to do it until now.
00:01:26 I'm gonna do it today, the day this is recorded, but you should go do it. Yep, I
00:01:30 know, I know. I'm gonna make a note to myself. Go get those. I want those. It's
00:01:35 very sloppy, it's very sloppy. Was there any updates on the pixel V-non pixel
00:01:39 red man face? The pixelated version overwhelmingly won, like almost two to
00:01:45 one. But was there any issues with the guys? Can they do that kind of? I
00:01:49 suspect they can do it. I suspect it is doable. Well, cool, cool. But we'll see.
00:01:55 Well, there you go, folks. Hey, other news in the, in the news, it's May, which means
00:01:59 some people are doing me a math of a type things. Not me, though. No, sir. It's May,
00:02:04 so there's new butterflies on Yakitori Island. Oh, thank goodness. There's the
00:02:09 big one. Is that true? There's a scorpion. I got stung by a scorpion the other day.
00:02:13 Oh, goodness. Does that have the same effect as a tarantula? It is the same,
00:02:16 it's just you pass out and die. Epic.
00:02:23 Good, good. Glad to hear. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You already did the thing.
00:02:27 I'm sorry. But pause, everybody pause for one second and listen to this right now.
00:02:47 I couldn't. Okay, was that an animal crossing? Rose thing? It was. I couldn't hear the words.
00:02:56 It was. That's the same guy. Is that the same? That's Eleazar. That's our editor Eleazar.
00:03:01 Wait, that's Eleazar? Yeah, that's him. Okay, then was Eleazar the one who did the,
00:03:06 it's time to shit on the pizza party podcast song? It, I think it may have been. Yeah,
00:03:10 it must be because it was, that's the clearly the same guy. I didn't even realize that was Eleazar.
00:03:16 Also, wait, there's another one. There's another one. Let's listen to this.
00:03:19 Ben Saints Animal Crossing Time To Talk About All The Times Has Had Breeding Flowers
00:03:26 In Your Dazed Tool of Poses To Ben Saints Animal Crossing Life
00:03:32 There Is Full Of All The Black and Purple Flower
00:03:37 Ben Saints Animal Crossing Time
00:03:43 Yeah, well guys, my Rose Garden has expanded. It's covering like almost a third of the
00:03:51 freaking island at this point. It's real good. I got a lot of blacks. Purples are getting up there.
00:03:58 I got a lot of pinks by accident. I'll just probably throw them in the garbage or something.
00:04:03 Yeah, fuck those. Yeah, you know, I'm going for pinks actually. I'm trying to. Well, hey,
00:04:07 you know, I think today I'm going to fucking do the thing. I'm going to do the fucking thing
00:04:13 where I spend the money to get online. So if you want to come visit my island and you want to,
00:04:18 you want to dig up some pinks, that's fine. Or I can just bring them to your island. I don't know
00:04:24 whatever. I want pink windflowers specifically. I don't have any windflowers. Well, fuck that.
00:04:29 What are they? Wildflowers? All I've got is roses. Oh, I'll take roses. Roses are good too.
00:04:35 Okay, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure. Sick, sick. Well, there it is, everybody.
00:04:40 We've got a jingles. Did I already mention that I was on the bonus episode that I talked about
00:04:44 winning the stock market? Yes. Yeah, I think that was, yeah. Well, I'll briefly mention then I made
00:04:49 a shit ton of money on the turnip speculation and now I have a mansion of a fully upgraded house.
00:04:57 Looks great. But there's this village Fauna, the deer. She lives on my freaking peninsula
00:05:03 and she's cramping my style. It's my peninsula. She wasn't doing anything with it. I know she was
00:05:08 here first, but I moved here now and I've got big ambitions for it. So she's got to go,
00:05:12 she's got to go to the animal ghetto where she belongs, down in like Kramn of the bottom left
00:05:17 with Curlose and Gala. It's time for a new trail of tears. Yeah. She's got to, she'll be,
00:05:25 she'll be happier there among her own kind, I think. And she's standing in the way of progress.
00:05:31 There could be none of that on Yakutori Island.
00:05:36 Future, Utopia. Utopian is real in Ben St.'s world. We have to, you know,
00:05:42 where her house is standing would make a really nice parking lot. Oh, you know, that's true.
00:05:47 Hey, we got a voicemail that I did not play, which was someone said they had a genius idea
00:05:52 of how to make so much money. And this was their genius idea. You go to your store, I think, where
00:05:57 you can buy the fruit that they sell on your island. This is what he said, for 400 bells,
00:06:02 then you, I assume you fill your inventory and then you go to another player's island
00:06:06 and you sell your fruit on theirs for each fruit making a 100 berry or belly, berry,
00:06:12 whatever it is, profit. That seems like a very low profit each time you're going to be doing that.
00:06:17 Well, you would make a hundred, you would make a thousand bells per stack.
00:06:21 Would times 40, I guess, which is 40,000? So you would make 40,000 bells, yeah.
00:06:26 Okay, that's not bad. That's not too bad. Now you could definitely do that.
00:06:32 If you went to someone else's island where your fruit was for into them.
00:06:36 I'm glad we crunched the numbers. I was wondering about that.
00:06:38 Oh, anyway, hey, I just want to say, since it's May, I made the definitive version
00:06:43 of the Miyamafufa jingle, Miyamafufa 2 theme, that is. I am very proud of it. Lots of memes in
00:06:49 there. If you watch my streams, I'm sure you'll appreciate it very much. So go check that out.
00:06:54 But beyond that, congratulations. And I'm excited to see what the other people who are doing Miyamafufa
00:06:58 is doing, of which I know too, that is Nexus and May, aka Pantsu Party. So good work on those.
00:07:05 I bet there's more people too. And corrupting your kids, because it's across both channels
00:07:09 that she's doing. Right, right. What is she doing every day? Making videos. May, May, May is what it is.
00:07:16 A video every day, is that it? Yeah, video or live stream. Okay. What's Nexus doing?
00:07:23 He's drawing a picture. Yeah, he's drawing a day, I think. Good. As you should. Jade Moro.
00:07:29 I think Nexus is in particular, it's like some weird experiment where he has like a character
00:07:34 and you have to fill her room with stuff, like people have to comment stuff that he will draw
00:07:39 around her or something like that. What's the girl? It's like generic girl. It's filler girl.
00:07:44 He used her for like Inktober once. Yeah, that's right. You always got funny ideas.
00:07:51 Well, I hope it doesn't take too much time away from Nexus finishing the vaporette.
00:07:57 Jade Moro says she's almost done with hers and I haven't heard from Kazi and Munchie in a while,
00:08:01 so I can only assume they've been working hard on theirs. I've heard tales of Kazi
00:08:09 doing some work on it by her own admissions. She says I'm working on it, so I think she may be
00:08:15 working on it. I also heard tales, but Jade said like yesterday, she said hers was like basically
00:08:21 done, which I... That's good. That reminds me of something else I wanted to bring up regarding
00:08:27 that, because last year when I was doing me a MAFA, I had the film festival, the film contest or
00:08:33 whatever, and a bunch of really talented people entered and some not talented people don't get
00:08:37 me wrong. But some of the impressive guys, I've been keeping tabs on a little bit,
00:08:43 see what they're doing. Most notable was the winner, Fune Bure, who is an insanely talented guy,
00:08:49 and there was another guy, 404Tales, and I just happened the other day to stumble across a video,
00:08:55 like buy that guy 404Tales. That was like, oh, it was like the greatest cringe of all,
00:09:01 horny on main, something like that. And I thought to myself, absolutely not. Oh yeah,
00:09:07 of course did you would say that. It occurred to me that this seems like the kind of name
00:09:12 a video would have that gets really, really popular. And I'm like, oh, that must be why it's
00:09:16 recommended to me. But I click on it, it's got a couple hundred views or something. It'll be in
00:09:20 the show notes, I'm sure. And I watch it, and I had some thoughts about that and Fune Bure too,
00:09:26 because both these guys are insanely talented and put ridiculous amounts of effort
00:09:32 into their videos. And they're both in like this weird, I don't know, that starting enigma place
00:09:38 of like starting your YouTube channel, or it just like you've been doing it for a while,
00:09:42 but it hasn't really grown yet and hasn't caught on. And I was trying to think of why that is,
00:09:47 considering how much production value there is in this. And I think I had, yeah, go for it.
00:09:53 Because this is something I've been thinking about lately as per my whole fucking neuro typing
00:09:57 chart thing, which has helped me to understand my own content in a way, because I've always
00:10:03 insisted that I'm somebody who's like doing non-objective, opinionated, like it's just me,
00:10:08 it's Gonzo, and anybody who follows everything I do would obviously know that. But there's always
00:10:13 been this weird disconnect where people watching just my anime videos expect me to be like a critic.
00:10:19 They're like, oh, you missed this detail, you got something wrong. How could you criticize a show
00:10:24 if you're not going to be exacting about it? And it's like, well, that was never my point.
00:10:27 That's why I'm a Gonzo journalist. But I realized that the problem is I had not figured out how to
00:10:34 translate the script in a way that focuses on the emotions instead of the logic. If the point is
00:10:44 not to be perfectly logistical, but to tap into an emotion, then it's like anything you put into
00:10:50 the video that doesn't contribute to the emotion is essentially pointless. That is exactly kind
00:10:57 of what I was thinking. But yeah, go on. You can add all these things because you think people want
00:11:02 a video to be flashy. They want it to look clean. They want it to look good. No, they want to connect
00:11:08 with the video emotionally. They literally just are there to feel something. They're there to take
00:11:13 the ride that you're providing for them. And you've just hit them with facts. How is that ride so
00:11:18 great? That's kind of what I was thinking about. And I think that clean presentation can work for
00:11:22 if you're a channel like Polymatter where it's like literally facts being dumped into your head.
00:11:27 And it's like just very clean animations and information and all of it contributes to the
00:11:32 point. And that's important too. If you're trying to make a point with your video, all the images
00:11:37 should help make the point. It shouldn't just be that it looks nice. It's that it looks nice and
00:11:42 it's helping to make the point. If you just have like a bunch of pointless animations,
00:11:46 then it's just like, why are you spending all this time keyframing something that nobody cares
00:11:49 about? Like, just to make your video have the impression of being fancy, who cares? That's
00:11:54 pretentious. That is the definition of what is pretentious. I suppose so. But I mean, for both
00:12:00 of these guys, yeah, I mean, when I was kind of reviewing this and I didn't watch all of it all
00:12:04 the way through whatever. I'm not speaking about these guys in particular, by the way. I've never
00:12:06 seen anything like this. Right, of course, of course. These are just the ones I haven't
00:12:09 ever seen enough. And I thought that with both of these guys, who obviously I respect a lot,
00:12:12 and I think they're great at what they do. But it's a key issue of there's a missing narrative
00:12:19 throughline through some of these. Like, they're just describing thing. And I get some people can
00:12:24 succeed with that. But when I watch these, I get to the end, I'm like, I've gone on a ride,
00:12:29 but where did I get at the end of it? What have I achieved?
00:12:31 Would you say it's like akin to an editor putting like random images that match the words
00:12:40 phonetically, but not, you know, they don't serve the point? Right. In a sense, yes. But
00:12:44 there's even a bigger problem, because I really don't feel like I've like, again, not I like
00:12:51 both these guys, but I'm just trying to be constructive. My criticism here, it's that like,
00:12:54 I don't feel like there was a real point. I feel like that like in the writing stage,
00:13:00 they put down some thoughts on a thing that just kind of go, I don't know, not particularly,
00:13:05 and you know, there's no, you could see you could express the exact same feelings. But I feel like
00:13:10 a well written script would leave you with like a punch. It's like, ah, like a like an aha moment
00:13:15 at the end. It's fun to feel that. There's lots of people who make content like that. They just
00:13:19 like, you know, cringe, horny, or main, like, they just look at a bunch of things that are cringy,
00:13:23 and they as a YouTube personality reacting a funny way to it. And then them reacting in the funny
00:13:29 way is the point. So like, are they not doing that? Are they like just displaying it?
00:13:36 I think the key issue here is that may be true, but so far it is working for these guys.
00:13:41 I mean, I would say that I had a conversation of like this earlier that was about like,
00:13:46 just explaining that I think a lot of people, they don't really understand how to put the
00:13:53 thing into words, and but they still are trying to make an analysis video. And it's like,
00:13:57 if you don't understand how to put it into words, put it into something else, put it into,
00:14:02 you know, put it into the editing, the music, the sound, like whatever, but convey the idea.
00:14:06 Like, don't just like, give me fancy editing and you telling me how you can't figure out,
00:14:12 like how to explain this thing, like, or explaining it in a roundabout way, you know,
00:14:17 where I don't really feel like I get the point, like, make the point however you can,
00:14:21 but there needs to be a point, you need to understand the point. And if you can't put
00:14:25 the point into words, put it into something else, you know? Yeah, yeah, I basically agree.
00:14:31 I don't know. I like these, both these videos, just an example to be mildly critical, contained a
00:14:36 lot of some thoughts swirling around the issue of like, horny on main and like, simping in that,
00:14:43 like, Budokan show that obviously I had strong feelings about. But, but I don't know, something
00:14:48 was missing. And I'm trying to help these guys and anybody who finds himself in a similar position,
00:14:53 because I upon watching both, I'm like, I enjoyed this ride for the surface value, but like,
00:14:59 it doesn't give me a connection or like, I want to hear what this guy has to say about
00:15:03 next thing and a reason to come back. I don't know. I'm listening. Oh, I'm not listening,
00:15:09 but I'm watching muted the four or four tails video. And he's got like the four or four logo,
00:15:14 like DVD, like, jumping in the back, but he cuts, he cuts and it doesn't, he doesn't let it go all
00:15:22 the way. He doesn't stay there. He cuts and it changes around. That's the worst thing about this
00:15:27 guy. This guy sucks. That was a little unsatisfying. It's true. I wish he had moved his avatar, but
00:15:33 left that thing bouncing around. And you know what, just because I watched this one, watching this
00:15:36 video, I thought that like, what this video would contain, and I was disappointed when it didn't,
00:15:41 was lots of examples of people being horny on main that he would present in an amusing way,
00:15:47 but it's mostly just his thoughts about it. And that was somewhat unsatisfying, considering
00:15:53 that it was just his avatar moving around as he continues to describe various thoughts about it.
00:15:58 Again, not bad, not bad, but there's way too high effort to have like 299 views.
00:16:06 I know, I know. And it makes me feel for the guy, which is why I want to want to help because I
00:16:10 respect both these guys greatly. I don't know. I don't know. So hopefully this has been some sort
00:16:15 of useful critique. As I'm working on my remake thoughts and stuff, I've just been reassessing
00:16:21 like everything. I'm kind of getting back to like what I originally did on YouTube now with this
00:16:26 kind of shit. And it's like, I'm trying to think like, what was the point of all this? What am I
00:16:29 trying to achieve? What makes a video good? Why bother criticizing a video when quality literally
00:16:37 doesn't matter, and it only exposure matters? Well, the question is, is it that these guys are
00:16:43 not getting the views because they're not connecting with the audience? Or is it because
00:16:47 they're not, you know, they're just not getting seen? You know, like I do think that, you know,
00:16:53 it's not quality doesn't matter, but connecting does. Like it's just that a lot of videos connect
00:16:59 incidentally or through almost no fault or consideration of the actual, you know, creator
00:17:03 of the video. But, you know, as long as there's something people want to see, that's why they
00:17:08 come to it. And like, just looking at the simp moho video, like the thumbnail and title are
00:17:15 terrible. Like they don't convey anything to me at all. It just says simp moho. I don't know what
00:17:21 that means. The thumbnail says simp and then there's like, I don't understand what most of the
00:17:27 thumbnail is. There's like vaguely an anime somewhere deep buried in this thumbnail. But
00:17:33 like, what the hell is all this black shit around it? What is this whole silhouette thing?
00:17:37 That's his style. That's why would I click on that? It literally does not tell me anything. It
00:17:45 just says simp and then it's confusing. Okay. Okay. First of all, everyone knows what a simp is.
00:17:50 And when you see this ominous shit and a little bit of anime thing, I think this is a more provocative
00:17:55 title than I know means click on this video. It's sort of in the right direction. But like,
00:18:05 yeah, it looks, it could be any name of the show. I mean, what is this video supposed to be about?
00:18:10 Just simp in general? Like, is there a question that it seeks to answer? It should be okay. I
00:18:15 watch like 30 seconds of it. And I guess it's him talking about simping. It should be called like,
00:18:20 it should be called something that is like, let's know that it's going to be a guy talking about
00:18:25 video should just be called simping the anime and then have a big picture of the main girl,
00:18:30 like doing a simping move and just that is the thumbnail. It should be a picture that indicates
00:18:36 simping, you know, like, this is just a picture of the show. It does not show simping in the thumbnail.
00:18:43 Like there are the show definitely has many, many, many, many powerful visuals to convey
00:18:50 simping as a concept. What show are you talking about? The show that he's talking about in the
00:18:55 video. Which is definitely about simping. It's a show about simping. That's why me and Nate covered it
00:19:02 in extensive depth earlier. I know it's a little cringe, but I don't think it would be a bad idea
00:19:07 to have like, he's got a very expressive, like, and stylish avatar. He should feature his fucking
00:19:13 avatar, like, you know, making the DreamWorks face and like crossing his arms or something, you know.
00:19:18 That does work on YouTube.
00:19:21 I mean, why have an avatar like that? Like, it's a nice avatar. I like it. It looks good. I think
00:19:26 if I saw it in the thumbnail, I would be drawn to maybe click on it. I think me and Fune and probably
00:19:32 404Tales as well. We have this thing where like, he clearly, he clearly, if you just watch the video
00:19:38 and look at the thumbnail, he has a vision for like the style of what he wants to create. But this
00:19:43 is YouTube. Our vision is worthless. It matters not at all. What matters is getting people to
00:19:47 click on the video and keep them coming back. I mean, I just don't think this is a good title
00:19:52 or thumbnail period. Like, it conveys nothing emotionally. Like, a title and thumbnail only,
00:19:58 I mean, aside from on YouTube, the meta is that it has to be an ad for your video. But aside from
00:20:04 being an ad, if you're treating it like a title or like a, then it needs to be an artistic encapsulation
00:20:10 of the point of the thing. Like a title of a book, like to kill a mockingbird, you know, like,
00:20:15 that is a fucking title. You want your title to sound like that, you know? So that's why I said,
00:20:20 like, simping the anime and then like a picture of simping, you know, and then I get it immediately,
00:20:26 I would definitely click on. Maybe put your avatar cringing. I don't know, something. Yeah.
00:20:30 All right. All right. That's my advice. Well, I hope that's been constructive feedback, Fune,
00:20:34 out of love for you and your craft and you 404Tales. That was what it was intended to be.
00:20:39 It pisses me off when people put so much effort in, but they're not rewarded fairly.
00:20:45 I mean, life isn't fair, right? It's all about putting your effort in the right place. You have
00:20:48 to work smarter than hard. Working hard won't get you nearly as far as working smart will.
00:20:53 The 404Tales one is better. At least there's like, it tells me a little more about what's gonna...
00:21:00 The title is good. I like the title. I actually like the thumbnail of that one. I mean, it's
00:21:05 evocative. I would say this one's fine. I'm surprised it doesn't have a shit ton of views.
00:21:10 Like you said, it seems like... It seems like a video that would get lots of views, but I mean,
00:21:15 it happens to be a small guy who I had heard of, so got recommended to me, but it did get
00:21:19 recommended to me. That's a sign of success. That's good news. He's got an interesting avatar.
00:21:25 I like this idea. This is very... It reminds me of like Kimono Friends,
00:21:32 like the studio that does that, like their style.
00:21:35 Oh yeah, yeah. That's cool.
00:21:37 Well, okay, there you go. Hopefully that's been useful. Ladies and gentlemen,
00:21:41 please continue. Good luck, everyone, on your quest to succeed and not die.
00:21:45 I really like titles that are excessively informational. I mean, that Final Fantasy video,
00:21:53 like Final Fantasy 7 remake came out and I have thoughts pertaining to it. That's the entire
00:21:58 title. It's a really stupid, bad title, but I really like it. I would click on things that
00:22:02 are like that because it's unusual and also it tells me what it is. It's like all those memes
00:22:09 where it's like Shrek, but every time Shrek appears, the movie doubles in speed or whatever.
00:22:15 Like the title is the entire meme, but then you click on it and it's actually true and that's the
00:22:19 joke. Even though it would be my inclination, some guys like Matthew Matosis get away with it
00:22:24 because they're over the hill of this sort of thing, although they probably could do better,
00:22:28 but I have to resist the urge to, when I put out my video calling it, Final Fantasy 7 remake
00:22:32 review. That's the worst possible title. Matthew Matosis titles, he's successful despite those.
00:22:41 I don't see why that's a bad title. I think the only thing that would be better is if you also
00:22:46 gave it like another, like a secondary title that is like your particular brand of like,
00:22:52 these are my, this is my review series. Sure. Like if it was Final Fantasy 7 review.
00:22:58 Like as much as I dislike, I hate everything's content. It is a very good gimmick to say I hate
00:23:04 this. It's a good gimmick. It's a strong word, gets people interested. No doubt. Even though
00:23:09 sometimes I think he hates those things a little bit less than the title might imply. Oh my god.
00:23:13 That fry. No. Impossible.
00:23:20 Well, that's all I had to say about that. I did go mushroom hunting yesterday, which was kind of fun.
00:23:26 Yeah. Please play Cowboy Bebop mushroom hunting in your mind as you listen to this, ladies and
00:23:32 gentlemen. Why did you go mushroom hunting? The conga drum. Sicily, Tijuana, India, Osaka,
00:23:39 Indonesia. But why did you go mushroom hunting, Nate? I want to know. Well, Michelle has been
00:23:45 enraptured by mushrooming culture. Yeah. Yeah. This is the thing. Who are a notably secretive?
00:23:54 I like a good mushroom from time to time. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Very secretive,
00:23:58 like cult of protecting their secrets. Because, okay, there's a mushroom called
00:24:03 a Morrell. Here, I'll get you the image. There's a, what's that fucking show on YouTube?
00:24:09 Best of the worst. Yeah. There's a, there's a Best of the worst where one of the videos they watch
00:24:13 is, it's like a guy. Morrell madness. Morrell madness. Just a guy just gushing about Morrell
00:24:19 mushrooms and how to hunt them. I've got to check that out. Well, we went, we've gone out twice now,
00:24:25 hunting Morrell's, which are supposed to grow in Ohio, in southern Ohio, which is where I live.
00:24:30 Badass. I know. They are, they trigger that, trypophobia. You know what I'm talking about?
00:24:38 They look like sponges. It's the holes. They, they, they frighten me. Okay, but they're supposed
00:24:42 to be delicious. And they, they supposed to grow, Michelle just goes down these rabbit holes sometimes
00:24:49 and we, she's just gotten into mushrooming and Morrell's are like a prized find in this area.
00:24:56 And she's been watching, she's been getting very depressed, watching people who are finding
00:25:00 like hundreds of Morrell's. We've been out twice, has not found any, and it's making her very sad.
00:25:05 Well, you must not be looking in the right spots. There must be somewhere else. Yeah,
00:25:09 this is what I'm saying. Like southern Ohio, which is where we are in forests. And you know,
00:25:14 we've been looking around a little bit. So we were just out there. Sit down and wait for them
00:25:19 to grow. What would you do with a Morrell if you found one? You, we cook them. You cook them is
00:25:25 what you do with them. They're supposed to be delicious. Slice them up and fry them or?
00:25:29 You know, I asked the same question. She said, you know, fricassem in, in butter,
00:25:33 make a little cream sauce served on a. So yeah, slice them up and fry them. Slice them up.
00:25:37 Yeah, yeah, whatever. You just, just fucking bite them out of the ground and eat them.
00:25:40 And put them on a, what are they called? Like a, like a toasted slice of bread or
00:25:44 something and you eat it with like a sauce on it or something. It's supposed to be delicious.
00:25:48 I can't stop staring at them and mushroom hunting is overpowering all of my thoughts now.
00:25:53 That baseline is rumbling through my body. It's on my mind every moment we're out there.
00:25:59 I would eat that. I would eat one of those. They terrify me, but she ordered some from Amazon
00:26:04 anyway, just to try them while we continue the hunt. I have gotten my fucking oligo saccharides,
00:26:11 my friggin tapioca soluble fiber. I have been like blending the shit together to try and make
00:26:19 a gummy. I finally got a gummy consistency that was hard enough, but it was not sticky enough.
00:26:25 It like fell apart a little too hard too easily with the teeth. When you bit into it,
00:26:29 I think there was too much coconut oil. So back to the drawing board. But yesterday,
00:26:34 I, I got my fruit flavors. I got peach mango, pear, you know, the works. It's going to be great.
00:26:42 But I don't, but the thing that I'm waiting for the most is my citric acid, the thing that will
00:26:48 make them like really tart and sour and you roll them in like a sour, like a sour gummy.
00:26:51 Oh my God. I feel like I'm making progress. I'm making progress on the candy front. It's very
00:26:57 exciting. I'm looking forward to it. I want to try some. I can't wait to get molds. When I have
00:27:03 the gummy, the worm molds, that's when it's going to really be real. Yeah. I'll send you some extract
00:27:07 of morel when we find some. Yes. I'll make some morel gummies. It sounds good. And by the way,
00:27:13 last thing on the subject is just that I mean, one of the reasons it's been challenging is because
00:27:17 the morel community specifically is extremely protective of the locations of these morels.
00:27:24 We, the first time we went out, we, we were just out there, there were a bunch of people and one
00:27:28 of these guys just like, Hey, how's it going? Like, oh, you know, doing a little mushroom hunting.
00:27:31 They're like morels and we're like, you know it dog, you know it. And they said, we have scoured
00:27:36 this forest. You met other mushroom hunters. We met specifically morel hunters and get this,
00:27:41 not only that, they had a bucket of some substance and we were like, Hey, what are you guys up to?
00:27:46 They're like, so there's no morels in this forest in Cincinnati. We have a bucket here of spores.
00:27:52 We are planting around this forest to grow specifically morels for next year's season.
00:27:59 Yeah. This is the degree to which morels are beloved in these areas.
00:28:05 How did you meet other mushroom hunters? We were simply in the woods walking around and it
00:28:10 happened to come up in conversation. And did you pick where these woods like specifically
00:28:14 recommended as a mushroom hunting location? I think, yeah. I mean,
00:28:18 otherwise it just seems like an incredible coincidence. Maybe it's like a thing like
00:28:23 with quarantine, the only people like daring enough to go outside is the mushroom hunters
00:28:28 because they love them so much. And by the way, all the only people you could find.
00:28:32 I can't help but think of, remember Elizabeth, that real thick mushroom from Dark Souls one DLC
00:28:39 You keep Myra in her curves. Yes. All these images flood to mind. Also, the bad ass mushrooms
00:28:46 from Dark Souls one, you just beat your ass and they're like the strongest enemies in the game.
00:28:49 All good stuff. All good stuff. Anyway, so mushrooms. I wish you'd been doing that. Me and
00:28:55 Michelle have been out there. That's the reason for the name.
00:29:02 Indeed, on Twitter. I always wondered why she was called that. It didn't make any sense before.
00:29:08 Michelle Tobin. It's very unfortunate. Well, that's it. Been hunting mushrooms,
00:29:14 so that's what's going on in my life. Mushroom hunting. It's a great time. It's a great time.
00:29:21 What's going on with you guys? Shit, other than animal crossing and mixing gelatin into
00:29:26 goop. That's all I got. Oh, you know, okay, here I'll just get my other thing out of the way and
00:29:31 everyone else can say their piece. The other thing I'm doing is watching the tutors,
00:29:36 which is a showtime historical show about Henry VIII and all his wives. And it's pretty based.
00:29:42 It's pretty excellent. And the main thing it's doing is making me think that history is in fact
00:29:47 awesome, even though there's some inaccuracies on the show, which is fine. But I want to call
00:29:52 out Munchy. I wasn't sold until I heard inaccuracies and now I'm down. Now, yeah, it sounded boring
00:30:00 until you said that they were inaccurate. No, it's the story of Henry VIII is like,
00:30:04 truth is stranger than fiction. Shit. It's awesome. I love political machinations,
00:30:10 though I didn't even know what the Holy Roman Empire was until I watched the show.
00:30:14 When's Munchy's freaking lecture coming out? That's what I'm here to roast him about. Where the
00:30:18 fuck is the French Revolution lecture? I want to hang it with my nibba, the Marquis de Lafayette,
00:30:24 our guy. He's the coolest guy. And I miss him every day. Fuck you, Munchy. Harass that man.
00:30:31 The spirit science lecture was extensively edited and came out months later, so I wouldn't be
00:30:36 surprised. This doesn't even need any editing. He put visuals. We don't need to see what the
00:30:40 fucking Marquis looks like. I mean, I won't go into spoilers right now. That's not the kind
00:30:46 of editing the spirit science lecture had. It didn't show anything from the spirit science.
00:30:51 It was just madness. It was just crazy, delirious, fucking aesthetic editing.
00:30:56 Sure. Well, I would argue this doesn't need any of that, and I just want it out.
00:31:00 This is good, though. Munchy, don't work on the lecture. Make the vaporette. Thank you. And good
00:31:06 night. Do both, please. I mean, it was like my favorite lecture, and I want to watch it again,
00:31:12 so I'm missing it. All right, there you go. He's been canceled until that comes out.
00:31:19 Apparently, I guess I'm off scot-free until Munchy's comes out then. Is that the way this works?
00:31:24 Oh, yeah, I forgot about yours, too. Wait, didn't you say yours was going to be done soon?
00:31:28 You were working on it, too, but it stopped. You said it was almost ready.
00:31:32 Look, things changed. I never said it was almost ready. I never said anything like that. I just
00:31:37 said I was working on it. Okay, okay. You were working on it. I mean, initially, my plan was to
00:31:43 not edit it at all and to just have both cameras in full streams the whole time,
00:31:49 but then I found a way to edit it that made it much more entertaining,
00:31:55 and so I just wanted to spend the time to make it good, but then I have a lot of things I have to
00:32:03 work on. I'm just too much on my plate, dude. It's fucking a lot. I didn't edit my first lecture
00:32:10 at all, which was fine, but then I saw Nate's the intro, the one-piece lecture. I was like,
00:32:18 you know, I like that. Maybe I would like to put something like that on the Sonichu one.
00:32:24 I mean, I really like. There's definitely something to be said for just starting the lecture when
00:32:28 the people start out. Yeah, but you're a little like just like five-second like musical intro. It
00:32:33 just makes it feel like more substantial, and I don't think it takes anything away, so I like
00:32:38 that. I want to do something like that. It's cool. It's cool. Just a little something-something.
00:32:44 I have a question for the first May-May-May video. Why are you the tripod? Is that your
00:32:53 idea? Do you want to be the tripod the whole time? No, it was really distracting. It was simply a
00:32:59 matter of the fact that we thought, oh, we could do it in front of this Henrietta Wallscroll that
00:33:05 we have, but directly in front of that is the couch, so I am on the couch holding the camera
00:33:13 to film. But the thing is that from the description I was given of the video, I thought it was going
00:33:19 to be like eight minutes long. Like, so I didn't realize I was going to be like holding it for
00:33:25 45 minutes, so, you know, I had to kind of get comfortable. It was one of the things you start
00:33:30 filming, and then you realize, oh, I have to hold this camera in place. Like, oh, right, that's hard.
00:33:37 I don't have any physical strength to do that with, so. Same. Yeah. Well, the good news about
00:33:43 these things is that, like, I don't know, like, when I started MiaMath of a one, for example,
00:33:48 I, like, had not figured out my style, but, like, by the end of that, when I was done with that,
00:33:52 I was like, oh, like, I've made, like, 30 videos. I, like, this kind of placement for the camera.
00:33:56 I'm just going to do this, and then all of Viagua's for, like, two years happened, and I was reasonably
00:34:00 happy with it. So you figure out a lot of shit real quick about, like, how you want to make your
00:34:04 videos and what you're into. So you burn through that stuff all quickly, so I don't know. You
00:34:09 realize you need a tripod after one episode. That's probably the best thing about doing a video
00:34:12 every day. I mean, like, when I did it in August, back in 2018, it was very much, like, every video
00:34:18 was completely different style, just because it was, like, the question was always, what can be
00:34:24 done within this time of day? Like, all right, I've got an idea for a video, like, what edit,
00:34:28 like, what level of editing can I do on this concept in the fucking five hours, you know,
00:34:34 and you get really inventive. And then you go, actually, that was fine. Like, that little 30
00:34:40 minutes of editing I did there. That video was entertaining, and I had no problems with it.
00:34:44 So let's do all of them that way forever now, you know. Yep. That's the goal. Goals.
00:34:52 It's a very educational experience. You should try it if you're thinking about it.
00:34:56 Well, so I've been just working on books. I've been writing novels. I've been making songs.
00:35:07 I've been fucking having, smoking more weed than anybody's ever smoked since Snoop Dogg.
00:35:15 And so cool. No, it's not, it's not cool. It's not cool at all.
00:35:24 But, you know, but it helps. So, so I've just been sitting around thinking about shit and making
00:35:33 stuff, and it's been sick. I have nothing to talk about. I thought I did at some point.
00:35:40 Tom, Tom, please.
00:35:43 Tom, save us. Tom, Tom, you're, you're a crazy, you're a wacky guy. Tell us some shenanigans.
00:35:49 The only shenanigans that have been happening to me the last couple of days is that I've been
00:35:52 hit with some sort of technology curse and everything has been destroyed. So I'm recording
00:35:59 right now with my old microphone because my audio interface is just not, well, it works.
00:36:05 But the problem is that for like a long time when I got my old computer, it would constantly like
00:36:13 crash and was saying like, Oh, one of the things connected to it is crashing a computer. I'm like,
00:36:16 well, that's dumb. So I finally built my new computer. I was excited to never have that problem
00:36:20 again, but it's still happening. So I guess my audio interface is just broken. And then my friend
00:36:25 let me borrow one of his computers yesterday because he's like, I got a new one. I don't need
00:36:29 this anymore. And I was going to use it as a render slave. And I touched it and it died. I don't
00:36:34 know what happened. I like would I just cleaned it out because it was covered in fucking dust.
00:36:40 I've been sitting in a closet forever. And so I was like, Oh, I'm going to clean it. I'm going to
00:36:43 make it look good. I'm going to like be a good responsible person and make this computer not
00:36:47 choke on itself. And I turned it on and there was no video. And I was like, okay, that's dumb.
00:36:52 Then it just didn't turn on at all. So I guess all the components died and I thought the power
00:36:57 supply died. So I guess I got to buy a new power supply for him because I broke it. But then I
00:37:01 figured it wasn't the power supply. It was the motherboard and the graphics card that both died
00:37:05 at the same time. And I was like, well, that's stupid. Then the graphics card just started
00:37:09 working again for no apparent reason. So I don't know, I'm in a cursed zone right now. And
00:37:17 that's all bad. It's all gay. I don't like it. I have like my old mic taped onto a
00:37:22 arm so it can still be not crappy. It's all it's all dumb. It's all bad.
00:37:29 Well, shit, man. Where's the happy ending to this? I don't know to be concluded so much for my happy
00:37:36 ending. Digi, what I want, I was wondering, because a couple of days ago you tweeted out about
00:37:44 artists and their inspirations, I guess, and saying, oh, this art reminds me of that.
00:37:52 And then I responded to that tweet saying, this is the problem whenever someone comments,
00:37:58 like, oh, your art reminds me of whatever. And they get pissed off. That shit drives me crazy.
00:38:04 It's so dumb. It drives you crazy that you think that? No, it drives me crazy that people,
00:38:10 when someone, when some normie comes into your art's mentions, like, oh, this looks great.
00:38:15 It reminds me of some popular thing. And they get offended. Yeah, it's just like, that's not meant
00:38:23 as a derogatory statement, 99% of the time. But like, artists get on their fucking high
00:38:27 horse and are just like, oh, it's don't, this is the wrong thing to say. You know, they have their
00:38:31 dumb little like graphics as they can draw on shit. They're like, don't say this, say this. And
00:38:36 it's just like, shut up. You're not a boss of people. I think the problem with the culture
00:38:42 around artists is that with it being such a like, you know, art kind of is an inherently like emotional
00:38:48 thing to do, you know, and these people, they want to feel like, you know,
00:38:53 protected in their ability to express these things that they have these intense emotional
00:38:57 attachments to. So it's like anything you say, it's like, you know, oh, you're going to say
00:39:02 something negative about my baby, you know, but it's like, you really need to be understanding
00:39:07 about the intentions of the people talking to you. Like it's, it's one thing to be like, oh,
00:39:14 this is an insult like inherently, it's like, well, it's not, it's not inherently an insult to
00:39:19 compare your art to somebody else. It's usually complimentary. Like if that is upsetting to you,
00:39:24 you can tell the person, but like, you know, it should be under, you should be understanding of
00:39:31 the fact that that person would not assume that you were going to have a problem with that. Like,
00:39:34 why would they think that was an insult? You know, like when I tell Ben anything, I'm excited.
00:39:40 Champion is like Naruto, but gay, you know, hopefully he takes that in the positive way.
00:39:45 Sure, sure. It's just funny that you tweeted that because I'd like, I had for a completely
00:39:50 different purpose, I was like, made this meme for my friend, because we were talking about this very
00:39:55 topic and I didn't post it because I assumed to art Twitter would get mad at me. But that's,
00:40:01 that's my thoughts on the matter. Lincoln, I agree. I think the reason I was able to
00:40:06 make the tweet funny was that I made it like sympathetic to both parties, you know, the
00:40:11 fuck is the limb in the foreground? That's what I was wondering. It's a very ominous limb. It's
00:40:15 very scary, right? But that's like the image macro for the meme. Yeah, what the fuck? It just looks
00:40:22 like part of the furniture. It does. I think it's, is it an arm or a leg? I want you to imagine
00:40:31 that it's leading up against that desk, like that it is that size. Oh, it's that big.
00:40:37 That it was leaning on the desk. We just, we just don't know. That's fucked up.
00:40:40 We just don't see a giant gross head. Sick. I think it's a guy in the foreground who's doing
00:40:47 like a weird, weird arm angle thing with a bent elbow. Like his head would be right off. We're
00:40:52 going to have to track down the guy sitting there and get an explanation, but all right,
00:40:56 what was going on in the frame over there at this exact moment? But I don't know. I mean,
00:41:01 obviously when somebody looks at your art and is like, and like doesn't engage with it the way you
00:41:06 want them to and is like, Oh, I have a more popular thing in my brain that this reminds me of,
00:41:12 which is like distracting me from just appreciating this the way you would ideally want me to. Of
00:41:16 course, that doesn't feel like ideally good, but you know, you got to, you got to control how you
00:41:22 react to these things to a degree, I suppose. Speaking of that then, Lord of Ghost chapter four
00:41:28 was, I think, not quite out by the, maybe it was out last time, PCP, but now it's definitely out.
00:41:35 Yeah, you guys have seen it. What is my comic? What is my art reminder of? Because nobody's
00:41:40 actually made comparisons. Lord of Ghost comic is fucking cool. I was going to say,
00:41:44 homestuck a little bit, but not really. I mean, hmm. I like reading it because it's cool.
00:41:50 Thank you. I can't think of anything offhand. You're welcome. Oh, there's a comic I really
00:41:53 like called Stone Toss that there's a lot of overlap here between the themes. Yeah. Yeah.
00:41:58 Really gets my my noodle going.
00:42:04 What of the 13%? Hmm. Yes, I must consider this.
00:42:08 Hmm. That 2% though. I don't know. I think there was, I don't know, like some of the
00:42:16 thing was maybe it's a reference like riddle me this. Oh no. Okay. I'm sorry. It was a racial
00:42:20 slur. Something me this Batman. What is 13, but also 51 or something very, very based.
00:42:29 I can, I can fill in the list. Indeed. Indeed. Disavow. And thusly be amused. Indeed. Indeed.
00:42:36 I love all of God's creatures. Anyway, this guy needs to work on his posture is the main
00:42:42 thing I'm seeing going on in this picture. Both him and our man kind of shrink that down,
00:42:47 not enjoying this. What if he just has a big arm? What are you talking about? Oh,
00:42:53 it must be the legendary Coomer. This is this gigantic arm from all that cooming he's been
00:42:57 doing. There he is. His bones also. His arm did not get any bulkier just longer. Just longer and
00:43:04 wider. Yeah. Proportionally larger. Yeah. Great. Great. As is Dick also grew proportionally,
00:43:09 which happens when you coom excessively, as I understand it.
00:43:16 Did you have an actual answer for that? What my art style reminds you of? Or at least the Lord of
00:43:21 Ghosts. Oh, your art style? Yeah. I mean, yours is very distinct. Like, your art only reminds
00:43:30 me of your own art, for the most part. Like, there's obvious elements of homestuck, especially in
00:43:35 like, Baaljape and the stuff that's, you know, done in that style. But, uh, like when I think of
00:43:40 Lord of Ghosts, um, yeah, and it's just like very Hippocrates style, you know. Not much just comes
00:43:46 to mind. I mean, okay, honestly, a little bit of like the rounded characters like in stone toss,
00:43:51 like there's a little bit of an overlap in just like the, I don't know, character. I just sort of
00:43:56 see it a lot. I would assume that like where your illustrating influences come from are probably
00:44:02 things I am less familiar with, as they are probably more like British. I would assume, but.
00:44:07 Well, no, I mean, I'm mostly going off of like Scott Pilgrim and One Piece. Okay. I can definitely
00:44:15 see Scott Pilgrim. Specifically the hands and capes and stuff, the boots. I'm thinking like One Piece
00:44:20 sort of stuff. Your style is just so abstract, you know. Like you tend to, I imagine everything
00:44:30 with you has like a wobbliness, like a bloobliness, you know, that like makes it very distinct. Like
00:44:36 that's what I tend to focus on is that the wobbliness of the aesthetic. When I think of the
00:44:41 Lord of Ghosts comic, like the image that comes to mind is like my favorite or most iconic panel is
00:44:45 the one of like, I think it's from chapter one where the Lord of Ghosts is like screaming with
00:44:49 both his mouths and his eyes are like bulging out of his face a little bit, and he's like
00:44:52 reacting to whatever it was. And I'm trying to think of something that looks like that, but
00:44:56 I just keep it back. Like when I try to like imagine the Lord of Ghosts comic in my head,
00:45:01 I just keep picturing all the like epic sewer shots of just like the gigantic backgrounds in
00:45:05 the sewers. That shit was ill. Control alt delete seems like a major inspiration for the art style.
00:45:13 Yeah, honestly, I'm like, I'm looking through it right now. And, you know, the closest thing that
00:45:21 it reminds me of, I guess, is like some of the like, not not all of them, but some of those like
00:45:27 mid 2000s, like new grounds, flash animations, just because for those projects, they had to use
00:45:33 like really simplistic form just because that was kind of like what flashers about and they were
00:45:36 animating it. I feel like you're really capturing that kind of like simplistic
00:45:43 form where like it's very much everything's defined by its silhouette more than anything else.
00:45:47 And like it doesn't have too much detail, but enough to to separate everything from each other
00:45:53 and give everything a distinct look. Like I could easily see this animating in that shaky kind of
00:45:59 old school flash kind of style. Like like there's a fish in my door.
00:46:02 You can see like hippo inviting a vizek or something maybe. It's like my favorite
00:46:07 new grounds. It's like my favorite new grounds anime series, CCC city, the greatest work of art
00:46:19 ever committed to the internet. This looks epic. Have I gushed about CCC city?
00:46:25 No, I don't. I see a guy with dark circles on his eyes, so I'm sold.
00:46:30 This it's it's it's only like like a dozen flash animations by this guy called Vinny.
00:46:38 And I guess there was a webcomic, but I never read it. It's just like this like it's that like
00:46:44 yeah early new grounds kind of like crappy anime like style like pseudo anime American
00:46:49 take on it, but like they're actually great and they're really good and they're really cool.
00:46:56 And I want them to be real life. Maybe we'll get the Netflix live action adaptation one of these
00:47:03 days. There's one one of these is like the whole video is like slow motion in reverse of like a
00:47:10 guy falling out of like an airplane and it's just you watch him like rise up from the ground and
00:47:16 like shit like this battle is going on around him, but you see the whole thing in slow motion
00:47:20 reverse and it's sick. What do you call it? The not the cinematography the fucking directing
00:47:26 I can tell is really good. Like they're blocking things out and they've got like depth of field
00:47:31 transitions, which is really difficult to do in flash. That big idea I can immediately see they
00:47:37 have a lot of like ideas. It's a lot of solid they do. This whole the whole thing it's like I
00:47:45 guess CCC city is just this big like giant like fucking it's like it's like the city in um in um
00:47:52 what's that game space port janitor yeah yeah it's like space port janitor but like it's huge
00:47:57 and it covers like a whole planet and it's like all everyone is like a weird anime character with
00:48:02 like all this weird like bullshit like armor on their fucking sticking out of their heads and stuff
00:48:07 and it's what a fucking treat. Is that one spanish? My favorite fucking thing in the world.
00:48:12 Well it's watch these flash videos. Flash was cool. I'm watching it right now and then you'll
00:48:19 understand me better. The drawing's not super complicated but yeah the composition the shot
00:48:23 composition and stuff the way he's like framing all the the cuts is really good.
00:48:29 I'm watching the start of gravataxis right now. Remember Rebecca the stamper that's still the
00:48:36 greatest video ever made on Newgrounds. Short and sweet baby that's all you need. Wait what? Which one?
00:48:43 Rebecca where uh oh god what are the names Jerry and Rebecca and the uh the kid I don't
00:48:50 fucking remember their names but it's legendary. Oh yeah Jerry, Rebecca and the kid. Wait you're
00:48:54 thinking of Hot Diggity Demon. He did Jerry. That's not true. Yeah it is. Yeah Jerry the and
00:49:01 like he's a depressed guy and he has a terrible life. Oh Jerry right right well fuck that I'm
00:49:06 talking about Rebecca the legendary animation by stamper whatever it'll be in the description
00:49:11 people will know what it is everyone everyone loves it especially me. Yes correct correct.
00:49:19 Well boys I feel we're out of steam here and we do have a bunch of voicemails if you want.
00:49:27 I forgot to say about the Kickstarter the rfck kicks it ends at 9
00:49:32 p.m. that's when we'll be 9 p.m. EST so we'll be streaming for like a bunch of hours maybe four
00:49:37 hours or six hours before that that's when that's when the ball fucking drops at ratty
00:49:43 twitch.tv slash rattyfriker's cop killers. I got news I got my trump bucks today. Okay that's nice.
00:49:50 I got my $1,200 for being a good American. I have not yet. Thank you Donald. Did you
00:49:57 get it in the mail like a physical letter or something? Huh what did you get it in the mail
00:50:01 as a physical thing or was it a transfer? They are supposed to direct deposit it if they have
00:50:07 your information. I don't know why they didn't do that but yeah I went to the IRS site and I
00:50:11 they asked for my information and they were like okay we're gonna mail you a letter and they did.
00:50:16 Okay you know yesterday I was getting my tire I had a flat tire so I called triple A to help
00:50:21 me out with it and the guy said that he was gonna give me like the guy would happen to be
00:50:24 changing what we were talking about whatever and he was like uh yeah hey have you gotten your thing
00:50:27 yet? I was like nope not yet. He's like yeah there's a website that my mom found that you can go to
00:50:32 that they will tell you like if you're ready or like if you're eligible. Yeah it's just the IRS
00:50:36 website. Just the okay I gotta fucking do that. Just be like the IRS homepage there's a button on it
00:50:40 that's like get my payment and they will ask you. Okay I'm gonna do that then. Yep I got my payment
00:50:45 yesterday as well so we probably got them around the same time. All right not bad thank you Drumpf
00:50:52 you're back at it again. All right well if there's nothing else to say I want to shout out Vic and Hope
00:51:00 so they're doing like real serious stuff I've been watching the videos they've been putting on the
00:51:05 channel and you know they've launched a patreon. Victor is trying to do like real youtube show
00:51:13 stuff and he's just put out a they just put out a podcast let's play where they're talking about
00:51:21 um you know well Victor's been talking about like gaming the system and doing all this SEO
00:51:26 shit and his approach to youtube is very like tactical I think that's really cool and I hope he
00:51:32 succeeds. Yeah he's had for a while now he's been the guy that we've thought about like uh uh like oh
00:51:38 you know like canton was partially inspired by like Victor saying like guys I watch these other
00:51:43 youtubers I don't even like because they do the thing about the shows I want to hear about please
00:51:47 do that so it sounds like he's doing it now which is good that's what I've been telling him to do
00:51:52 for fucking seven years god damn it like he's just literally doing what I was like badgering him all
00:51:57 the time like hey Vic it's really fun to listen to you just describe shows you should do it as a
00:52:02 youtube video series like there's actually a video uh on the Modal Soul production channel
00:52:07 it's probably unlisted right now because the audio is like almost it's so quiet you can't hear it
00:52:12 but it's Victor in a wig in that that girl wig that he wears some of the time of just describing
00:52:18 the the first episode of Aquarian Evolve for like 10 minutes and it's just like because he used to do
00:52:24 this like he used to just watch movies and then just describe them to me in the funniest way and I
00:52:28 would be like you have to do this is this is like a gift you need to do this all the time you need
00:52:33 to do this on the internet and then there was a double shot the drinky pony where he did it with
00:52:37 my little pony episodes but he did like two I think he did one that actually got posted and
00:52:42 then I don't even know if he finished the second one I don't remember if it ever came out I think
00:52:46 it did but uh yeah that never happened and he just kept being like uh he was just so down on youtube
00:52:51 it's like a thing as a career as uh it's gay I don't want to be some youtuber it's like he's
00:52:55 right the second he found himself on lockdown and was like oh this is actually the most reliable
00:53:00 career right now all of a sudden bam youtube time you know what he's right it was probably for the
00:53:06 best to not do it to develop other useful skills let me sure solve everything and tell tell him how
00:53:12 to do it and now he can just come in and fucking sweep the sweep the sweet rewards the sweet nectar
00:53:19 of my knowledge and uh that I brought to the world so make sense make sense sick I mean victors victors
00:53:28 camera alone makes him uh epic and good and very very nice well I mean if it does become a full-time
00:53:37 youtuber then like we we got him you know I mean that's got him he's in our clutch I mean his
00:53:44 because the schedule is so flexible it's it's like like gig-based or whatever I'm sure he can
00:53:48 do camera work and then also be a youtuber when he's not doing that probably seems like a pretty
00:53:52 decent business model especially because they both kind of lend each other I don't know about
00:53:57 I don't know about like like to be a really successful youtuber you need to be putting out
00:54:02 content forever until you're dead constantly I'm thinking of it more of as like a hobby that
00:54:06 happens to make money but I see your point I see your point yeah you can I guess you can be like
00:54:11 pretty big as long as the videos you make are like really substantial like if you're making
00:54:17 impressions on current shows it obviously needs to be very soon after the show is aired
00:54:23 that you make that video that's true and also it's not like high um no it's not high art it's
00:54:31 not the greatest stuff like people aren't going to wait months for like a you know a first impression
00:54:36 sort of thing right right they'll wait months for a genre an episode for some reason well that's
00:54:42 that's led by the comedy and it'll be about things that aren't timely so you can get that pretty
00:54:47 much anytime I feel if you're like one of those legacy youtubers the rules don't necessarily apply
00:54:52 to you as much you know that's true your name precedes you it's well you know what I think it's
00:54:57 the comfort of just seeing a familiar face like I think I think in a lot of people's minds like
00:55:03 if you never had a moment of disillusionment with John Tron then your impression is just like oh
00:55:07 John Tron he's a funny guy ergo it's funny to see John Tron saying things I mean what's a game
00:55:15 lizard brain it's so powerful oh you know here's a good example if Matthew Matosis released
00:55:21 just like his bloodborne review I would be on that shit I don't care how outdated it is or
00:55:28 how many lore videos I want to know what Matthew Matosis thinks about bloodborne yeah but that's
00:55:33 because Matthew Matosis has never let us down you know like yeah that's true it's like I've
00:55:40 really been enjoying his smaller videos he's been making oh yeah you know I caught up on like
00:55:45 all his videos except for a couple of the Zachtronics that those are the ones I'm watching now
00:55:48 and I'm just like ah yes I've forgotten I don't know like I got a little bit out of it when he
00:55:53 was doing all the Zachtronic but now I'm like caught up on almost everything I'm like mwah
00:55:57 this is the good shit I love these little videos I just want to hear him talk about a game that
00:56:01 Kiro Blaster video I was like yes I love this I want to hear more things like this I'm still
00:56:07 got to watch that beautiful Joe one because that is not interesting to me I am bored by that video
00:56:11 yeah but everything else that Victor I like and hope I don't even know why are you telling me that
00:56:16 you have to have played the game that he's talking about to he did listen to the video no no not at
00:56:22 all uh beautiful Joe beautiful Joe then I don't know something about it was just playing yourself
00:56:29 I don't know maybe it's weird like I loved his commentary on Devil May maybe it really is that
00:56:34 I haven't played it and just am not interested in that particular game because I loved his ones
00:56:38 about I mean the the Dark Souls ones I loved his deep dive into those I do think your impression
00:56:43 would be very different if you had played it simply because yeah the gameplay that he shows in the
00:56:48 videos is the highest conceivable level gameplay of that game yeah and that game is almost impossible
00:56:55 like it is that is one of the hardest video games I ever played when I was a kid like even just getting
00:57:00 through the first couple screens was hard like understanding the controls like I think you
00:57:04 would you would not have trouble with it obviously as you know what I think that's exactly it but I
00:57:09 think I need to play it in order to appreciate that video it's definitely worth playing it's fun
00:57:13 yeah okay it's it's his literal favorite game except for Wonderful 101 right is that
00:57:17 do I have this correct it's his absolute favorite but yeah yeah I love all them camea games that
00:57:22 game I did play so I enjoyed his shilling of the remake or the Kickstarter for the remake or whatever
00:57:27 if you play Devil May Cry there's a couple DMC references in Beautiful Jet I clapped I clapped
00:57:34 when he did the the reference it's my favorite as a kid and I still clap today because I don't care
00:57:39 I wear my fanboyism on my sleeve unabashedly unashamedly well you know what I it's different as
00:57:46 opposed to like making a sequel to something you know this is funny it's like with Final Fantasies
00:57:52 every game was distinct and not a sequel and so when you got like to the next like for example
00:57:57 in Final Fantasy 7 the fact that Holy and Meteor are like giant plot devices which just like were
00:58:03 black and white major spells like up to that point and actually Meteor was kind of a big plot
00:58:08 point in Final Fantasy 4 it's like oh what a cool way to like capitalize on this meme in a way that
00:58:13 like in no way like messes with like continuity or anything because it's its own it's its own story
00:58:18 but like wow so cool that they would do that and and same with like the Clover Studio stuff
00:58:23 whatever the old Capcom going into Platinum and stuff again that's really cool to see those kind
00:58:28 of references done in that way but with like a sequel I don't know something about that has far
00:58:34 less soul back to the the the soul discussion or whatever it's uh it's more I don't like Final
00:58:39 Fantasy 10 like of course it references the shit out of Final Fantasy or 10102 I meant to say like
00:58:45 that inherently is more boring and I would be way less interested in any of these like connecting
00:58:50 threads than in like I don't know like Final Fantasy 11 or whatever. Some sequels are good obviously.
00:58:56 Of course of course I don't know just just a fun thing I like. Well I mean you expect a sequel to
00:59:01 reference the thing it's a sequel of. Yeah yeah so I guess it just feels more like. Or be weird if it
00:59:06 didn't. I guess it becomes like an obligation as opposed to like a fun bonus in in that sense so
00:59:13 I don't know. Anyway we weren't talking about that we were talking about. Yeah yeah that'll
00:59:18 that is all to say that like Matematosis can get away with making a video whenever he wants
00:59:23 because his opinion his take on video games is so powerful for lack of a better term because I
00:59:30 don't know terms. Yeah so powerful that people will wait for that and I don't know yet whether Vic
00:59:37 and Hope can make videos like that. Victor is definitely incredibly entertaining to watch
00:59:42 and listen to. Like I would I just love seeing him but he would probably need to like make videos
00:59:48 all the time in order to actually gain traction. Yeah of course. I mean I just hope I like you
00:59:54 know his his main sort of series is that like just describe the plot of or anime done quick
00:59:59 that's what he's calling it even though it took a really long time to describe the plot of Fate
01:00:04 Zero or Fate Stay Night Rather. But like you know. As quick as can be done. I've always enjoyed
01:00:10 watching him do that and like for me it's legitimately made Fate watchable like I would
01:00:17 not watch Unlimited Blade Works. It is fucking boring. Listening to Victor describe the plot
01:00:22 was a thousand times better than trying to sit through the fucking show so. I enjoyed the visual
01:00:26 novel. I don't need the anime. It's just that was enough. You're not a visual novel guy though so.
01:00:32 Well particularly I just think that the visual novel is written like shit. I actually have a
01:00:37 video. I wouldn't say it's good. I was inspired to buy Victor's recap to write a video about Fate
01:00:44 that I might do soon. That is just about like how I think it's basically just emotionally retarded
01:00:50 like like it's a story that's like just obsessed with having like as much shit in it as possible
01:00:56 but like the story is garbage. Like it stuff just happens. Like have I mentioned it's just
01:01:02 character standing around and talking and then showing up in scenes and fighting. Yeah I mean
01:01:07 that's true. I know I've probably said this before but like have I mentioned like how unique an
01:01:12 experience reading the visual novel of Fate was and I did like every route. I didn't get every
01:01:16 ending but you know there's a lot of like little ones whatever and like the very particular experience
01:01:21 I've never had before in a story. There was a little bit of an Harry Potter I guess but it's like
01:01:26 the vast amount of detail describing the unique specific agonies of a character engaged in battle
01:01:33 like oh and then I felt my left tibia break and ooh that made me have to stagger forward. Like in
01:01:39 an anime you won't get any of that. You're going to see like him take you know 50 hit points of
01:01:45 damage basically and then get up with a little blood and keep going. That was a very uncomfortable
01:01:50 reading experience but it was unique and I always I always remembered that uh uh after finishing it.
01:01:56 I don't know like even just the way that like I don't know it's actually kind of fun to think about
01:02:00 when if you're if you're in a battle like in a war and you've got like you know a 50 pound sword
01:02:05 and like a 20 pound shield or whatever maybe maybe less than that whatever and you are continually
01:02:09 swinging at your opponents you don't see this in video games you don't see this in a lot of
01:02:14 anime or whatever like you will get tired and your bones will start to hurt after your I don't know
01:02:19 fifth swing I've practiced like kendo a little bit you just do like a hundred swings and you get
01:02:24 fucking tired with like a bamboo sword uh so like when you're doing it one hand I don't know
01:02:29 fucking battlefield or whatever you get fucking exhausted and shit and the novel goes into detail
01:02:35 on like how fucking tired shiro is at any given moment and I kind of love it I kind of love that
01:02:41 it goes into that stuff even though it feels very strange like for an anime uh very very unexpected
01:02:47 it just seems like a lot of like what is what is good about fate is the details and so the visual
01:02:54 novel is the best way to experience that because it's just uncompressed detail like it's it's just
01:02:59 nothing but rambling about fucking information for 90 fucking hours you know and like if you
01:03:05 remove a bunch of that then all you're left with is the story and like that's what you get with the
01:03:10 anime it's like the story sucks who cares about the story you know they still think it's good
01:03:15 for some reason they still think it's good because the animation is cool and flashy you know it's like
01:03:21 all that anybody cares about is that all this dialogue and all this boring shit they just see
01:03:26 it as all of that is the justification for why I get to watch this fight scene you know like and and
01:03:31 not have to uh not have to think that the show is stupid you know let's say oh it's a turn your
01:03:37 brain off shelly no it's a think you show you have to pay attention to follow the plot the plot
01:03:41 stupid don't think about it here's a hot take I heard uh this will be my one comment about the
01:03:46 remake it was that uh in the original ff7 you would like grind a little bit through battles
01:03:52 to get to the story uh which was enjoyable it was the best part kind of in the new remake you
01:03:57 grind through the awful agonizing cutscenes uh to get to the fun gameplay sometimes and uh yep
01:04:05 hits the mark for me here you go this is my angry rant oh you know what's funny I watched
01:04:12 what were they thinking what were they thinking it was very i watched angry joe's review of it a
01:04:17 little bit angry joe loves the remake but he never played the original these perspectives are very
01:04:23 interesting god what i'm not surprised i'm not surprised how do you got it look yeah he can like
01:04:31 the original i guess or he can like the remake okay but how do you how do you be a professional
01:04:36 video game guy and you've never played f***ing final fantasy seven yeah he's just a different kind
01:04:41 of gamer i don't know he started off as a college differently abled he is differently abled yeah
01:04:48 were you saying something didgy uh no should we get our voice mails now uh we can certainly
01:04:52 that's literally like a film reviewer who's never seen like citizen kane it's like i mean
01:04:57 what you don't have to be a good reviewer of movies i don't know but you don't have to
01:05:02 see every classic but you should at least understand it's it's it's not that i don't think he can
01:05:08 it's not that i think you would need to to have a an informed opinion and be a decent critic i just
01:05:15 if you're gonna be that why would you not play like the most f***ing influential games of all f***ing
01:05:21 time i mean why would you do it that'd be good because you get into it too is to be this way
01:05:26 you see a fan of jr pitchers no not really no well then there you go he's the first person
01:05:31 shooter stupid guy i suck stupid ass dumbass angry ass okay uh enraged uh uh what's the spanish name
01:05:41 pablo uh but what begins with ease would be rhyme though say enraged pablo is good it's my it's my
01:05:48 new uh gaming youtube channel i'm starting right now ranting raul ranting raul that's a good one um
01:05:56 uh furious screaming simon now screaming simon whatever we solved it already we got it all right
01:06:03 all right anyway uh these are all good i'm gonna make my channel today uh i anger no that's he

01:06:56 the worlds but you know like cool i love the universe is it the narrative the fucking that
01:07:05 there's a narrative definitely there's like narration that goes throughout uh part three has
01:07:09 this cyborg like synthesized i am a cyborg yeah and all he wants to do is to vomit and like the
01:07:19 vomit and die is he cannot vomit or die and so he wants to do those things to be human the last
01:07:26 song really stuck with me because it was like one of my big i don't know what to call it like fears
01:07:31 but like cool fears that i enjoy having um where it's like the like uh exponential growth of he
01:07:38 vomits so much that his like head explodes and then it is like his entire body is filled with
01:07:43 vomit and then just it grows and grows and takes over the entire universe and kills everything with
01:07:48 vomit it was disgusting it's like four minutes of this guy describing the the the exponential growth
01:07:54 of the vomit as it fills the universe for four minutes on end as the music gets just like rises
01:07:59 and keeps getting more epic in the background it's awesome have you i mean this reminds me very
01:08:04 much of that comic maybe i can find it i google it don't see it immediately where a guy's like puking
01:08:08 it's all stick figures and then someone starts pissing and then shitting and then every person
01:08:12 on the planet catches this thing where they are vomiting green pissing yellow and shitting brown
01:08:17 and like and it's a virus that captures the entire planet and it zooms out and you see there's just
01:08:22 massive spirals everywhere of like a three-point spiral of yellow brown and green as every person
01:08:29 on the planet sounds pretty similar to what they're actually doing it more that's it that's the
01:08:33 comic it just ends with that maybe i'll see if i can find it oh i found it i found it uh hang on
01:08:39 i got it right here it's got parts it's got parts like vomit coffin filthy breeze rotting skull vomit
01:08:49 bomb it's good shit man uh that that album also has the 30 minute song about altered beast
01:08:55 about becoming the altered beast whoa oh sick this comic is fucking awesome yeah it's great it is great
01:09:03 he's like spiraling upward as a project that would force him up stronger and stronger like boil down
01:09:08 to one image this is good thank you for chan for making this i appreciate that this is basically
01:09:14 homestuck this is basically what happens when you get the coronavirus sicko thing i'm staying
01:09:21 indoors like here's splatters of bodily fluids on the window i can't stop this is a this is a work
01:09:33 you're right i do need to give a succinct piece of apocalyptic fiction i've ever seen
01:09:37 like yeah well well well this is basically no man this is what how impact is lost at all
01:09:45 every panel uh has purpose and meaning every image is so dense there's so much going on every
01:09:50 panel they're pointing with their mouths open what do they expect to happen they get hit with piss
01:09:57 and then vomit and then shit and then every man woman and child i know i know this is just funny
01:10:04 but like the line of action on these are really good it's really shows the comedy
01:10:10 there's real talent here i mean i don't know small one my favorite thing in the third panel is okay
01:10:15 and the shitting intensely this is it isn't there's just a tiny little piece yeah the tiny
01:10:21 history of this starts but then it too swirls into infinite power look at the way this expression
01:10:27 changes across the first three panels as well he realizes what's happening just like uh to like
01:10:32 oh it's like oh no like by the fourth one he's moving so fast that you can't even make him out
01:10:38 he's just a complete blur i i legitimately love the effect of like the spiral that starts so
01:10:43 type of then widens out and then widens to the big like beautiful like end of evan gellion
01:10:48 yeah like why did he start spinning because each stream is so strong it's it's just forcing him to
01:10:54 spin i guess we need to track this artist down and interview him get to the bottom of all
01:10:58 like the sixth panel the p-stream has become as big it's like giants oh my god the panel where
01:11:03 all the people are pointing up at the sky did you notice that there's a u turn sign that just says
01:11:07 no you every panel's so dense it's a rich tapestry right here what what caused this i why did this
01:11:17 happen to this man i don't know what began this cascaded ronavirus
01:11:23 once i made a thing i can't remember one guy i made a comic that really had to be
01:11:29 i mean this is like this is a classic i made a comic somewhere this is making me hungry
01:11:33 i need some chocolate this is like some fucking uh bloodborne shit i think this is what's
01:11:39 gonna happen at the end of bloodborne when the the celestials touchdown the elder gods have their
01:11:44 way with us uh what is the um what is the long blue line in the it's a river the panel right
01:11:50 oh that's just a river as we zoom out for larger and larger that's a that's a river yeah yeah we're
01:11:55 just getting the largest scope of the world i think oh that's we're looking from above down at the
01:12:00 ground yeah yeah oh it's cloud spiraling round i see yeah that makes sense what was like i made a
01:12:06 comic i linked it on the pcp like a years ago somebody in the comics linked it i'm sure somebody
01:12:10 knows where it is it was like the sun has sunglasses and like isn't impressed by your
01:12:15 problems at the end of it or something i don't know that was like the theme i had somebody
01:12:19 linked that i don't know wait you made that yeah i made it i made it like i wasn't inspired by this
01:12:23 specifically but like i just wanted to make like a shit posty like apocalypse style comic kind of
01:12:29 like this uh so sometimes you just hit with the spark i guess and then you make it real fast
01:12:34 well on that note uh speaking of the apocalypse this is just a random story i'll never get tired
01:12:41 this is absolutely wonderful how do we even get here i forget i don't know or care this comic
01:12:47 this is yeah you don't watch devil man uh don't watch end of evan gellion you just need this this
01:12:52 really gets to the core of the matter and it's great and it's great all right let's let's do our
01:12:57 voicemails we've got voicemails let's do it if you have a lot i just want to get it done there's like
01:13:02 seven or so i think oh this one is very appropriate for what we've just seen this is called uh good
01:13:08 pcp content uh of which i think we've just delivered all right well uh let's hear it up
01:13:15 take it away go i just want to say this is one of my favorite arcs of the pcp in a long time
01:13:20 because every week ben will talk about animal crossing and i'm like playing that game and every
01:13:25 week nate talks about final fantasy seven remake and i'm like playing that game as well i feel in
01:13:31 the loop of everything like back in like november when every week you guys were just talking about
01:13:36 pokemon it was it sucked because i play short and shield and it sucks and it was it was just every
01:13:43 week it's like oh man right pokemon sucks they could all have the pokemon which scissors um but
01:13:49 now it's like you know you love final fantasy seven but also you hate it and like the remake and
01:13:57 you know it's cool conversation and animal crossing is just a giant pure force of good um
01:14:04 yeah that's correct there you go all right oh that's it i mean sure uh the our instructions
01:14:13 i know yeah instructions are do thing that guy knows and it will be good content uh agreed
01:14:19 understood messed received all right next one is uh rad content rollout okay here's an informational
01:14:25 request uh take it away yo lads uh i just wanted to ask you guys uh what are the holdups for
01:14:34 further rad content coming out at the moment uh nate kind of hinted at this at stream uh all
01:14:41 my stream but it wasn't very clear uh he said he couldn't release the rad lecture because he was
01:14:46 waiting on the diss track but my question is like is that what's holding up everything else
01:14:53 like is everything else being worked on because like it's just a little confusing like you guys
01:15:00 pumped out those you did really good you pumped out those lectures super fast you know but then
01:15:05 now we've been like stalling sitting on like these other two what is what is it two or three for
01:15:11 like a month how long is this going um i mean i just want to know what's up with that here and
01:15:15 like if the distract okay is what's holding everything back all right we get recorded yeah i get
01:15:21 he says stalling but it's like they're bigger projects they take long yeah i have okay well i'm
01:15:26 not i don't want to release the sonichu lecture until i finish the slime and punishment finale
01:15:32 which i have been stalling on and just putting off doing to do for other stuff uh so that's the
01:15:37 holdup on that uh lol this is the story of my fucking life i mean i've got so many projects
01:15:42 i want to do but i've got a first project i got to get done first but yeah let's just do it idiot
01:15:48 i'm just very curious about like which content exactly he
01:15:52 is waiting on because of the fact that like well yeah that's what you said is it there's the lectures
01:15:57 there's the brad carling house um yeah our distract distract and then there's the well there's the
01:16:03 distract in the lecture which are tied together the ova is obviously going to take some time and
01:16:08 the animation is a part of the ova uh the dojin admittedly i don't know if we've even started
01:16:15 like workshop i mean we're we're kind of not worried about that right now because we've got
01:16:18 lots of other stuff hold off on the dojin until the um the ova gets a little bit more yeah for
01:16:24 a lot further along i mean we need the character designs to do the dojin exactly which we're
01:16:29 working on which we're working on so we're making progress yeah the progress has been made on the
01:16:33 animated op for that so um be excited i guess indeed i guess good and then i mean i mean some of the
01:16:42 lectures you know whatever bed and munchie they got there we already talked about we already talked
01:16:45 about what's going on with digi's lecture and munchie's lecture yeah right right uh yeah we do
01:16:50 gotta make some progress on the distract uh we're being a little behind the curve on that one we
01:16:55 could uh we could move that one for itself what about what about all of the can tent that you filmed
01:17:00 well you know we did digi and i did make one can tent that uh is in production and i it will be
01:17:06 released but it's not quite ready and i'm just wait i mean i've just got other oh at least one
01:17:12 waiting till nate is done working on what he's working on before we relaunch canton yeah and
01:17:17 then we'll get back to it like yeah the the fact of the matter is canton got taken down and so it
01:17:23 was like okay well we're not going to worry about this channel until it's back and then by the time
01:17:27 it was back we had radcon four and then also having to pick up our own careers after radcon four
01:17:33 while doing radcon four editing which is generally what radcon does that's why we wanted all that
01:17:37 extra money to cushion us for the fact that you know yep it puts us in that position the good news
01:17:43 though i mean i'm very excited because can tent finally got to a point where like it's monetized
01:17:48 and we're getting like enough viewership now we will actually be making probably some profit
01:17:54 when we get back to making those videos so i can't fucking wait we had we had gotten monetization
01:17:59 we're already the videos were very profitable like the second they started making money because the
01:18:03 cpm is really good but it was just like we made like there was like one or two months and then
01:18:07 the thing got stolen we only had like a small window yeah but once we're back there i'm excited
01:18:12 or something like that but yeah yeah it's gonna be good it's gonna be good ton of potential and of
01:18:17 course if uh if nate is still moving on down to virginia beach then canton can be i mean like
01:18:24 basically for me it's hard to like the idea of the show is that it's going to be a show we do in
01:18:29 person so it's like yeah of course it's like almost to to do like a relaunch without it being like
01:18:35 okay we're relaunching so that we can get to the point where you're moving down then it's like
01:18:41 doing it before that point is kind of pointless like the show is not supposed to be a podcast
01:18:45 recorded online it's supposed to be recorded in person so like you know once we are ready to make
01:18:51 those kind of decisions that'll probably be when cancent is like fully ready to come back
01:18:55 which should be before too long yeah basically i've just been busy and me and digi need to
01:19:00 work out some details and we will do that we're both extreme both because we both bite off more
01:19:05 than we could chew and have too many different projects at the same time and uh and no matter
01:19:10 what you drop somebody will be pissed off so you can't just be like oh i'm just gonna not do this one
01:19:15 thing i said i do to do this other thing i said i do um that's true everybody wants you to do all
01:19:20 the things you said you were gonna do so yeah never promise anything never promise it's the only
01:19:26 safe way so wait so how how close are you digi to getting all those rants done you're still behind
01:19:34 the last time a lot left yeah i mean there's there's a lot of there's a lot of rants i have to do
01:19:40 where i already consumed the thing i have to rant i just didn't record the rant because i wanted to
01:19:45 do them all at once um sure there's plenty of them that i have i still have to like most of my
01:19:50 stuff i have to read which is a pain in the ass because it's a lot easier to just watch stuff
01:19:54 because i could just get high and watch it and not have to fucking read um sure thankfully i'm
01:19:59 changing the way all this works after i'm done with it but uh yeah there's a lot of catching up
01:20:03 to do good but it's it's like well okay there's all the projects i have on my plate are all big
01:20:09 they're all equally huge projects and like it's the same position i found myself in once before
01:20:15 and in order to to make it so that i don't disappear for two months to go do those big projects
01:20:21 i'm trying to figure out like what can i release that can come out that's not that hard to do
01:20:25 that will be satisfying so that's what the otaku ganzo journal is about i already wrote eight of
01:20:29 those so that's just fucking smooth sailing um while i go work on this other shit but yeah i'm
01:20:35 working on a lot of fucking big projects so it's going to be as usual with me all of them will
01:20:40 complete at the same time and so it'll go from like six months of people saying digi bro's not
01:20:44 doing anything he slowed down to all of a sudden wow digi bro put out six books and fucking 20 movies
01:20:51 and you know he's active again and it's like no i just finished everything i've been working on
01:20:56 you know oh and you know what i don't know i this seems like an interesting thing to mention just
01:21:00 while we're on the subject like the other day you made a tweet that was it was it was a joke but it
01:21:04 was something in the spirit of like um what like people are complaining about that i'm not classic
01:21:09 digi something along those lines um no it was that people have been saying that i've been losing my
01:21:15 mind for the last three years there's particularly this was addressed about my my uh not discord my
01:21:22 reddit because when i created the digi bro patreon discord all of my patrons went to the discord
01:21:28 and abandoned the reddit so the reddit is only occupied by people who are watching my videos
01:21:34 but are not patrons and most of them have a have a problem with me but it's weird because
01:21:41 they've been in there for years saying the same stuff like these are people who have been hanging
01:21:46 out in my subreddit and they're the only people there like it's just a bunch of people who are
01:21:51 like really sour and bitter about like the changes i've made to my content but like when
01:21:56 they talk about it the way that they perceive the content is is really fascinating you know
01:22:02 and and it just goes to show that they in their mind it's like i've changed because of the fact
01:22:10 that i'm doing these things before or doing these things now that they didn't know i was doing before
01:22:16 you know it's like this is the stuff that i used to post on moda soul productions or used to post
01:22:21 on after dark or used to post wherever but now it's on the main channel and like i think for those
01:22:26 people or even you know really i should say it started from when i started posting stuff on after
01:22:30 dark that wouldn't have been there before because even that was a more manicured channel up until
01:22:34 2017 when i decided to start putting stuff that would have been on personal channels there so
01:22:39 like from these people's perspective it's like oh digi rose losing his mind his content keeps
01:22:44 getting weirder it keeps getting his view counts are dropping and it's like well if you look at
01:22:50 2015 where i only put out four videos a month and one of them got a hundred thousand views and the
01:22:55 other three all got less than 10 000 and you compare that to now where i put out 30 videos in a month
01:23:01 and one of them gets a hundred thousand views and the rest have less than 10 000 which one do you
01:23:06 think benefits me more and makes me more buddy it's the second one you know like putting out more
01:23:10 content has only benefited me it's just that it it changes the way that it looks it changes it from
01:23:17 looking like oh this is a guy who bats a hundred every video he puts out to like this is a guy who
01:23:22 puts out whatever he wants and when he feels like he needs to you know make some money he goes and
01:23:28 makes some content that he thinks he's gonna make some money you know um but like that's a decision
01:23:33 that i make and like you can turn that valve on and off because i don't i don't always i'm not
01:23:38 always in a position where i need to be busting my ass and growing in order to survive you know
01:23:43 like i can take my time and think about what i want to do and do something that's emotionally
01:23:47 satisfying uh because i have that that extra leverage of you know of of my career but like
01:23:55 it's it's been a very difficult balancing act and the whole time it's been dysfunctional like it's
01:24:01 never been perfect i say a difficult balancing act because i've never been balanced you know i've
01:24:05 been imbalanced if you couldn't tell this whole time so you know still trying to find that balance
01:24:11 but finding that requires going through the process of exploring everything that you think
01:24:17 might lead you to get closer to there you know and i do that in a public way because i have to put
01:24:22 out content all the time like a lot of this content might be stuff that you know if i didn't have to
01:24:29 put out a video all the time i would only release a video once a month when it was a fully considered
01:24:33 well thought out idea you know but like um and there are some people who succeed with stuff
01:24:38 like that so it's not that i couldn't do that it's not my style you know it's just like it's
01:24:43 just funny to me that from my perspective it's like i haven't changed what i'm doing i've just
01:24:51 made it more clear what i was trying to do you know the whole time it's like my intentions have
01:24:57 become clearer and therefore people who thought that they could relate to me because they thought
01:25:02 i was somebody else are now upset because i'm not like them you know i'm not or i'm not who they
01:25:08 wanted me to be you know it's like to some degree i think i understand the the counter position uh
01:25:14 and and i can articulate so when when you put out the tweet i responded to you uh privately
01:25:20 in a way that i thought would represent what i thought at the time you didn't really you weren't
01:25:24 seeing the other side of the argument and we had i don't know we had like a little bit of a long
01:25:28 back and forth um where i i tried to present it where i said that like basically yeah the way
01:25:33 that you've articulated here is pretty accurate it's that like your main channel has not had a lot
01:25:39 of like the kind of classic digi content which which specifically i would think is is basically like
01:25:44 scripted content and actually the video you put out two days ago the fear of continuing a show
01:25:49 that right there that hit that like ah this is the kind of classic digi flavor well and that's
01:25:55 that's what i've been looking for but so to put it like in in terms of like my chart again like to
01:26:01 because this is how i it's easier for me to understand it it's like uh it was very difficult
01:26:07 for me to create a style that represents what i am trying to do with my videos in a way where the
01:26:14 audience will feel the same way about it that i want them to you know it's like so so long so
01:26:20 many of my videos the problems people have with them are lexical problems it's like you you said
01:26:25 something wrong you had wrong information or you came at like you didn't watch the whole show this
01:26:29 or that and it's like how do i make these people understand that i'm not trying to be a critic
01:26:34 like how do i make them understand that this channel is not being about fair and balance it's
01:26:38 not being about it's not about being objective because i don't believe in that and it's like
01:26:42 i think the problem is that in my mind because of the fact that i don't believe in objectivity
01:26:47 to me it's just obvious that like whatever data i'm presenting is not hard data because in my
01:26:53 mind there basically is no hard data people don't think that way though and so if you present your
01:26:58 video in a way where it feels like it's data driven it feels like it's meant to be informative
01:27:03 people are going to look at it as attempting to be an informative video and i did not know
01:27:08 how to make that feeling go away while still writing the same way i do which is to use lots of
01:27:14 information to make an emotional point basically and so that's what the otogonzo tapes is about
01:27:20 it's like this is the the each of these videos is using stuff i know about anime but the point it's
01:27:27 making is an emotional point it's not this show is good this show is bad i think i understand you
01:27:32 know i understand your point there but i think that my analysis of the situation is much simpler
01:27:38 which is that you're a guy i like listening to and i have for many years and and i find your
01:27:43 takes interesting frankly speaking just the fact that this was a scripted video that inherently
01:27:50 gives that kind of cadence that alone yeah i understand why that matters for you you're
01:27:56 you're completely spot on of what what my intention was here because the the idea of
01:28:00 otogonzo tapes is for quadrant appeal i'm going through the same thing right now as well so i
01:28:05 certainly i think i have some insight the the idea of it is just simply like i looked at it and i
01:28:10 said what is like how do you appeal to everybody on my on my neuro typing chart right like if you
01:28:16 want to people just because somebody is a more lexical thinker doesn't mean they want lexical
01:28:22 content they want if if the content presents itself that way they want it to be perfectly
01:28:27 accurate if it doesn't present themselves yeah itself that way they don't care so like how do
01:28:31 i make the video appeal to those people because my audience comes to me because of the fact that i
01:28:37 i do have information i do have insight but like yeah what i use that insight for is not to make
01:28:43 objective statements is to help you deal with emotions like my channel is mostly emotionally
01:28:48 driven it's mostly about like trying to understand what emotions a show is trying to fill you with
01:28:53 or like what message it's trying to send you know so like by focusing on that and presenting it as
01:28:59 like okay if this video is really like rough and rugged if it looks like it was filmed in a bedroom
01:29:04 on a vhs tape like it looks like a home video and it doesn't start off like it like the tone of it
01:29:10 just feels so raw and personal and emotional in spite of the fact that i'm mostly talking about
01:29:17 data you know but the data is there to make the point so it's like it appeals to people on both
01:29:21 ends of the spectrum both emotional and logical and it doesn't have nobody has to get hung up on
01:29:25 anything nobody has to be like oh i don't get where he's going with this or like you know nobody's
01:29:30 gonna miss the point because the point is so blindingly obvious in every aspect of the creation
01:29:35 you know and so like that's what i've been looking for is how do i make a video that's easy to make
01:29:41 and also true to myself and also not confusing you know and i don't think it's a confusing video
01:29:49 i hope i i thought found it pretty narratively coherent yeah but if i i mean in general i mean
01:29:55 i think we're on the same point here if i could if i could make one recommendation for your channel
01:29:59 i i your desire to i think there is a certain logic in the way things were split up before
01:30:05 where your your more polished work would go on the main channel because i don't think there's
01:30:09 anything wrong with in theory someone having a specific channel with a specific purpose
01:30:14 to attract a specific kind of audience i don't find that inauthentic i think that's a totally
01:30:18 legitimate way and then you have another channel where the stuff that's fine it's taking the approach
01:30:21 of just putting everything on one channel also makes sense however that just makes people sometimes
01:30:26 feel that they're missing some elements because it can get over flooded it's harder description would
01:30:30 be more scripted content because i just there's a thirst for that i think just more not all not
01:30:37 even most but more would be satisfying for the audience i think i mean ideally for me all of
01:30:42 my content would be scripted like the reason that this i guess the reason i'm positing this is like
01:30:47 such a breakthrough is that you notice that was a scripted video with no editing it was just
01:30:54 one take it was one shot one camera take it took no time to create because it relied on the idea
01:31:00 basically like when i i think nate you probably are somebody who when you write a script you already
01:31:05 have in mind everything that is going to visually or audially appear like in relationship that is
01:31:11 how i kind of create them yeah i am not like that i write the script and i have like maybe five
01:31:17 images in my head of like scenes from the show or the thing i'm talking about that are like
01:31:21 like where there's a sentence that i wrote this sentence because i had this scene in mind but
01:31:27 there's literally like five of them so for me everything in between those images is just filler
01:31:32 like most of my videos comprise of just lazy filler where i just cut you know 10 second clips
01:31:37 together out of the first episode of a show to fill as much time as possible it is not exciting to
01:31:42 watch you know but it fills time and it serves attention well enough for you to finish the
01:31:47 video but it's not memorable those videos are hard to rewatch or sit through again i want my
01:31:52 videos to be something that in spite of the fact that it only took me 30 minutes to make it was
01:31:58 memorable it made the point all the visuals contributed to both the emotions and the logic
01:32:03 of the video you know that's the ideal so sure and like you know once i had this it was just it
01:32:09 was kind of funny that you you sent me those messages and i i agree with your sentiment but
01:32:15 i was already like ahead i was already in that mindset like i already wrote eight of these videos
01:32:19 you know like i'm already ready to bring scripted content back it's just like a question of how can
01:32:24 i write a script and not have to spend 10 hours editing the fucking video you know for a perfectly
01:32:31 understandable yeah and still be exciting so that's what i might well i mean just some thoughts from
01:32:38 an observer and a fan and a friend um and that's true the same thing with like fune boray and uh
01:32:43 and 404 tales i just uh hope to be useful and i would happily welcome any any pointers about me
01:32:48 as i as i try to i know this all makes me think though there's all these things that other people
01:32:53 think about their content that i i feel like i am just blind to because of my particular perspective
01:32:59 and i want to avoid that i feel like there's very obvious things like i don't know ghost the shell
01:33:04 like big and a fucking best anime ever stuff just didn't come out for years that strikes me as just
01:33:08 a blind spot things i should have been doing all along and then i just let details get in the way
01:33:12 of why why that has happened well it's just missing the forest for the trees which is very easy to do
01:33:17 if you're a detail-oriented thinker you know very true very true okay well that all said hopefully
01:33:25 people enjoyed uh hearing some of those thoughts we do have more voicemails such as oh my god i'm
01:33:30 excited for this one okay this one is called uh is e pal simp okay listen listen to this lads
01:33:38 i found this strange website called e pal dot gg and uh it's like you buy like a session with
01:33:46 someone to play video games with you and uh it's mostly girls but there are dudes and like is that
01:33:53 simping is it because it's like it's one person and uh you're not paying for like uh explicit
01:34:01 like content like you know pornography or something it's just you're playing a video game with them
01:34:06 it's got they got like you know like overwatch you know there's people and they're like and
01:34:15 they even got like little voice clips to preview them but you're like hey indeed i'm absolutely
01:34:20 simping 100 percent simping let's uh okay we get the idea disconnect now okay is it is it simping
01:34:29 i mean sort of is it because it's sad you should just have friends that you can hopefully do this
01:34:32 with play a game with you for like a dollar that's right that's right okay but but i found a true
01:34:40 hero i don't know if you guys have gone to the website is it asian andy asian 25 bucks asian andy
01:34:46 25 dollars per game he has a platinum in league of legends was by the way there's some diamond and
01:34:51 challenger people that's not even that impressive they have tags like sweet voice silly friendly
01:34:57 no flame or toxicity easy to get along with i think i just figured out nice with a little spice
01:35:02 i think i just figured out how to define a simp you know what a simp is a simp is somebody who
01:35:08 who willingly puts himself in a relationship in which they have they do not have any control
01:35:14 or could not make any of it wait a minute wait a minute i'm thinking now is this about maybe this
01:35:19 isn't necessarily about being a simp maybe it's about like raising your like win ratio because
01:35:23 you play with someone who's really good i mean i think that might be part of that actually that
01:35:29 actually is not a bad idea i mean if you're playing with a guy who's challenger you're gonna
01:35:33 do better if you're playing with someone who's platinum or diamond like your team's more likely
01:35:37 to win i still think the optics are just terrible that you had to go to this website true but i could
01:35:43 understand but if that's not simping though dude they call roblox mobile if that oh fuck yeah
01:35:51 dude you could play roblox with asian andy in the gang if that's your motivation like i would argue
01:35:56 that isn't simming is all about what's going on in your mind you know that's really what it's about
01:36:00 so would that be something no if you're doing it to have any contact with a girl because i because
01:36:05 i think that a key part of simping is that like if you could get around it you wouldn't do this
01:36:11 you're doing it because it's like your last option it's your only way to and no one no one should
01:36:17 operate their life and they're doing like the last case scenario if it can be avoided but by the way
01:36:22 listen i i did a little digging i did a little preparing here because i want you guys to hear
01:36:26 all right i prepared the voice clip of the legendary asian andy i want you all at home
01:36:31 to hear the the dulcet tones of this man this is how he sells you 25 dollars per game with platinum
01:36:38 asian andy in league of legends here we go this is his pitch go yo what up um i'm just gonna try
01:36:45 my hardest i don't know cool that's it that's all he says oh that is he was at the top he was at
01:36:57 his number two best seller he's number two on the charts people okay this is really funny do you
01:37:03 i love it i love him is it only like one time payments or can you subscribe to somebody you
01:37:10 know i'm not sure how the business model works i really think that and this is why i'm trying to
01:37:15 like find a way to kind of escape from patreon to a degree not that i want to shut down my patreon
01:37:21 but i want to make it for specifically the otaganzo tapes as a show instead of being okay sure and
01:37:27 because i see a huge problem in selling yourself as a product because you by the way did you i
01:37:34 totally agree with you can we just observe this uh this rainbow dash next to asian andy in this in
01:37:39 this main uh just absolutely beautiful absolutely wonderful okay he's he's a king it's like when
01:37:44 you make a transaction with somebody right like each of you has to like make the decision to make
01:37:49 this transaction about this thing like you understand what the product is to whatever
01:37:53 degree you've you know interrogated about it and they want your money you make the trade
01:37:59 it's done you know if there's hard feelings afterwards take it to fucking court you should
01:38:03 have done your research right but like right on patreon it's like you pay me every month to do i
01:38:08 don't know like stuff it's very vague and like different people will be disappointed by different
01:38:14 things and i'm kind of swayed by their influence they're kind of swayed by you know and it just
01:38:20 it's such a weird relationship and it's exactly what we all feared patreon would be like when we
01:38:25 got on it in the first place i think sure sure uh which is why like i think you're still per video
01:38:30 aren't you or did you ever go monthly um oh sorry that cut off could you say that are you still per
01:38:36 video or are you monthly no i switched to monthly a while back okay because like per video we were
01:38:41 all doing that because we were afraid of this exact thing of like i want people to understand
01:38:46 what the product is you know and it's hard to do that with patreon and i think that's what i think
01:38:51 that simping in general tends to be the result of subscription of like committing to a relationship
01:38:58 with somebody who you do not have a relationship with you know right like oh i'm going to pay you
01:39:04 ten dollars every month because you're hot and i'm gonna watch your streams but like you don't
01:39:10 really know what you're getting you're not there's no real product it's just like i mean there might
01:39:15 be a guarantee of a certain number of streams or a certain number of photos you'll be provided with
01:39:19 but like will they all be of equal quality will you get the same emotional reaction there's so
01:39:24 much up in the air and it comes down to just this very strange relationship where like these people's
01:39:30 feelings get really tied up in it you know and like simping is extremely emotionally damaging
01:39:37 it just not a good thing uh so you know stopped i totally sympathize with your point how does
01:39:42 it make so much money twenty five dollars a game i think he's 301 people not bad i think it's because
01:39:51 he's uh like a uh a known stream that's what i'm wondering like this guy must be known outside
01:39:55 the side right he's gotta be i would think i think it says on his thing it was bio like streamer or
01:40:01 something okay it's the only way it makes sense makes sense so like he that they go to him because
01:40:05 he'll help them win the game he's charging more than these other guys though i mean jesus he's the
01:40:09 most expensive he must have a kind of love his pitch i'm looking at these other pages and um notable
01:40:16 but league of legends probably this is like sprung around league of legends and this is why that is
01:40:20 the top billing yeah that's why asian andy's up there's like like it's playing with good players
01:40:25 is important yeah um all of these other ones the best seller category is entirely women of course
01:40:32 of course we can play animal crossing it just shows you what's really going on you know they have
01:40:36 animal crossing there animal crossing great yeah there it is there it is hey but by the way though
01:40:43 to digi's point you know uh my uh about the patreon thing my look my ideal patron is like a i don't
01:40:50 know maybe he's like a a 25 year old man maybe i don't know 26 27 with a job and like likes my content
01:40:59 but spends very little time worried about it and then is just happy when a video comes out
01:41:04 but is not spending tons of time like concerned or like thinking about and his investment is low
01:41:11 you just want to imagine everyone who watches you is like the coolest person they could buy my
01:41:16 ideal really what i'm trying to describe what i'm trying to describe is someone who's not overly
01:41:20 my ideal patron is you to sublimate listener yeah you're it yes you you can do it uh yeah i mean
01:41:31 my ideal patron just somebody who's card clears at the end of the month
01:41:35 that's just a warm body yeah that's fair i'll take cold buddies i don't give a
01:41:38 shit i don't know that almost sounds a little bit like i'm trying to wiggle out of responsibility
01:41:42 but my my favorite patrons are always the ones that give me like 20 dollars and then their rant
01:41:47 request is like i don't know i just give you money so do rant about whatever you want sick sure
01:41:52 dude sure that's good that's truly king or even the ones who just don't request anything and just
01:41:57 they're like i don't even care i don't want any of this extra shit i could barely watch your content
01:42:03 there is no favorites in my patreon my i love you all equally you're so special to me i love you
01:42:10 so much i love you i love you proportionals of the amount of money that you have given me that
01:42:15 as well this is not a i can't even promise that yeah yeah yeah you well moving on if you're a dick
01:42:23 about it you can be a dick about it yeah yeah there is such a thing as an annoying patron that uh
01:42:29 that uh i don't think i have any we get i don't think i have any of those at the moment it's pretty
01:42:34 sweet i don't have any either all right well anyway we'll rush to clarify patreon yeah not you
01:42:39 no no you're fine no not you not you of course if you're thinking i hope he's not talking about me
01:42:47 it's not you it's you if you're having that thought it's definitely you oh shit he's definitely talking
01:42:52 about me i don't know 100 there was nobody i was talking about so it could possibly be you
01:42:58 why would you have that thought if it weren't you it's you right i do this thing a lot where
01:43:03 i speak in hypotheticals and it digs me into holes because i just sound like i'm you know saying
01:43:08 horrible things but uh legitimately uh no no i mean there are people who hang around my community
01:43:14 and aren't patrons and are annoying those people definitely exist but as far as i know no patrons
01:43:20 are annoying you know you can make it so only people with roles can see your discord so therefore
01:43:26 oh i mean that's true i don't even necessarily mean in discord like on streams or i don't know
01:43:29 comments i mean those people exist obviously but you know and if you're thinking that's you it's you
01:43:35 all right anyway let's go to our next voicemail okay we got patreon.com slash give and take give
01:43:40 and take dot side for a non-judgmental patron experience uh you will get the things that i
01:43:45 promise in the patreon fair fair all right here we go uh soundcloud uh what i'm saying
01:43:52 fucking the next next voicemail oh by the way speak pipe link leave his voicemails description
01:43:55 there you go this is a buster one nandesca let's find out go
01:44:02 matao pcp it is i eroge samura today i want to teach you the english word buster
01:44:14 please
01:44:36 you know that is a good uh just dose of reality because we kind of were just speculating what
01:44:41 does buster mean it like it has a definition it kind of works you got a gun buster it's got a gun
01:44:46 it busts the aliens well wait he just said he just said yeah it doesn't you don't bust the guns
01:44:52 and you do bust the crime so like what's going on it's not the same god the the words can be is
01:44:59 there outwardly two words like with the exact same spelling meaning the exact same thing but
01:45:05 they're two distinct words impossible i'm thinking maybe criminal okay well beyond that we have a
01:45:10 follow-up sort of this is a little voicemail called fuck die buster old good new bag okay take it away
01:45:18 go die buster is a shit show and you're all wrong it could have been a great original show but instead
01:45:23 they decided to make a shitty sequel the key to the striking plot and themes and gun busters
01:45:28 space and time and how these properties affect the characters and their relationships keeps
01:45:33 building upon this theme until the end of the show when noriko and kawasaki are are sure that
01:45:38 they're going to have been forgotten 12 000 years later in the future and at least that amazing fucking
01:45:43 ending that nothing could top uh all this shit not in die buster i have no idea where the characters
01:45:51 are what they were doing and why they were doing it warp technology was somehow banned i think in the
01:45:56 show uh but the characters can still be wherever they want to be it makes a bullshit science fiction
01:46:03 terms where everything in gun buster which was sick as shit also die buster had more budget but
01:46:11 somehow looked worse than gun buster last episode of gun buster wasn't finished or in color and was
01:46:16 still more visually compelling than anything die buster had to offer okay it was fun hold on okay
01:46:22 we got this guy i hate this guy we have to address this thing i get i get that i get i'm sorry i'm
01:46:28 sorry it didn't have the time dilation thing i'm i get it it's really cool i know you really like
01:46:32 but it doesn't make it a bad show because it doesn't have the fucking time dilation shit we have
01:46:36 to address this fucking thing that comes up where people try to like talk about the last episode
01:46:41 being in black and white and that this was somehow a cost cutting measure which is the opposite of
01:46:48 true that's not true it in fact i think costed more money because they had to like shoot in a
01:46:53 different way than i looked into this yeah you're right and yeah i mean like well just even think
01:46:58 about it they had to paint all the fucking grays it's not like they just yep like why would color
01:47:02 be more expensive than gray i don't understand i thought it might have been it's all paint it all
01:47:06 cost the fucking same it's at least the same possibly more uh yeah it was a stylistic choice on
01:47:13 purpose so that that that's out the window uh well i mean this guy i don't know it was this
01:47:19 point that like he does like that about the original about gun buster gun buster was not even finished
01:47:25 and it still looked better than die buster which is oh well it actually was and he was
01:47:29 trying to say that die buster had like a way higher budget it probably had a higher budget
01:47:34 but i'm sure it had a higher budget completely different in in my opinion die buster looks better
01:47:39 i mean die buster was like i agree most cutting edge looking show of its time like it was like one
01:47:44 of the first yeah like digital anime that looked amazing like it looks so good to this i get okay
01:47:50 you know i get a maybe you don't like the cg on the robots and i'll give you it looks a little
01:47:54 awkward sometimes but i don't i don't care i sense that this man just loves the like the
01:48:01 theming and the styling of the original which is more grounded in reality uh like okay i totally
01:48:06 respect that you would prefer this the narrative of the original and stuff but he's just making
01:48:11 shit up like how the characters just move around too fast as ben said remember how noriko's like
01:48:15 giant arc on what's that episode five where she unlocks her fucking power to get that to teleport
01:48:21 she's she's gone for a while because she has to go to the edge of the solar system to get that
01:48:26 you know to supposedly get that uh buster machine which is okay and whatever man you like a style
01:48:33 more that's fine as fucking dumb you know the fuck you like it's like a shitty sequel because it
01:48:38 doesn't stick to the theme get the hell out of here it is a unique story it's got different like
01:48:42 you get like one more voice jail voice jail voice jail voice yeah this man's going to voice jail
01:48:48 yeah it's just for a stupid ass take you know talk shit about die buster around here
01:48:53 his name is was fuck die buster he's going straight to jail there you go no i don't think so
01:48:58 fuck die buster obliterate it fuck you i won't fucking have any of his and it's just the only
01:49:04 other thing is just it's just that like yes it doesn't touch the themes but like the ending
01:49:09 like honors the themes of the original and in no way does it like fuck with the original in any
01:49:15 way it just adds good stuff i guess i guess he thinks opinion okay i mean like this the sci-fi
01:49:21 stuff is like messy maybe you think that like oh like all the science in in die buster is like
01:49:27 it's all like weird like fantasy science oh yeah like gun busters fucking uh like the actions this
01:49:33 robot does in space would like what is that thing where it electrifies with those weird
01:49:37 things on either side like the sci-fi of what gun buster did specifically was real to begin with
01:49:43 i mean it's obviously not stupid gun buster is cleared more harder it's harder sci-fi it's more
01:49:49 it's more grounded for sure i don't know it seems to me like that's the point like it's the far
01:49:54 future and like the technology has advanced all these crazy ways but also they've locked off all
01:49:58 these technologies in some ways the world of gun buster is more advanced because they use warp
01:50:02 technology i don't think they um that's true yeah did they um like i don't think they ever do like
01:50:09 light speed travel in die buster although i don't think they do they must because like i mean well
01:50:15 no no does but no no figures how long did it yeah yeah but like before that how long did it take
01:50:20 her to get to pluto it was like an episode where she was like shipped off or something she was it
01:50:24 was like a couple weeks i think right you know what because that would tell us if it was faster
01:50:29 than light if we knew how well the distance to pluto in light years is um well it's three point
01:50:36 well it's three billion miles okay three billion miles in light years is oh yeah okay it's point
01:50:46 zero zero zero five okay that's not light speed and she's not going light speed to get there so
01:50:53 i mean she's going really fucking fast but like a fraction of light speed like a small
01:50:58 for maybe like a tenth of it or something there might have been a little bit of dilation
01:51:03 um yeah okay all right how much is that is that one gunlation is that one two thousandth
01:51:09 of a no wait if it could be a person i guess it would be that's like that's like one two
01:51:14 thousandth of a of a light year okay so there's nothing where do the uh nothing okay question
01:51:18 where are the guys going in gun buster when they travel and experience dilation like in the episode
01:51:24 like three they go to like the center of the galaxy in that's really far away that's in gun buster
01:51:30 in gun buster they travel like all throughout the galaxy in die buster they only go inside the solar
01:51:36 system yeah because the um the red the like drones like are like they won't they're protecting the
01:51:42 solar they won't let them leave the solar system and warp technology has been locked away well there
01:51:47 you go we have just confirmed basically that die buster does not fuck with the sci-fi in those
01:51:53 important ways sorry sorry you wanted more time dilation i get it but i get it but it's just go
01:52:00 to jail it did everything it could do with time dilation in gun buster it pushed it to the limit
01:52:04 which is why it's good you wouldn't even want to show to try to do more time dilation stuff it did
01:52:10 the best job ever so let's do some imagine if if gurren legan two came out and they just said uh
01:52:16 we're going to be the size of two universes this time yeah i'd kill myself i would end it right
01:52:21 then and there uh yes yes so there you go oh but we found like a new energy source that is even worse
01:52:28 for the spiral nemesis that's the fly roll the by roll yeah with a big b emoji at the front the
01:52:33 viral energy oh i hate that double um all right anyway now that he's in jail and we'll never
01:52:40 hear from fuck die buster again we can move along with our lives the menace has been stopped
01:52:45 huh oh here we go okay this is um how many more we got two more only two more and it is
01:52:51 art so fuck so's wuxo duck so uh has something to say let's uh let's give him a chance go
01:52:58 i recently picked up drawing with the mindset to improve after several years of casually doodling
01:53:03 i've made progress since starting and i recently changed my head shape to be more stylistic and
01:53:08 i quite like drawing that way the issue is that i can only draw half decent body when it's done
01:53:12 realistically which completely clashes with the style i'm aiming for any advice on how to
01:53:17 overcome this dilemma would be appreciated i don't understand he can only draw body he can only draw
01:53:26 bodies realistically but i think he's gonna get a problem with realistic no he can only draw the
01:53:31 body realistically but the head that he has developed is more like stylized and so he's trying
01:53:37 to figure out how to reconcile these two things i mean you gotta just keep you're just gonna have
01:53:42 to practice realistically yeah it's just practice you're just gonna have to experiment with uh body
01:53:47 shapes that you are good at drawing the reason you can only draw bodies realistically is because
01:53:52 you don't fully understand anatomy yet once you understand anatomy yeah changes to it maybe if
01:53:57 there is anybody whose art style is like similar to what you have done with the face see what they've
01:54:03 done for bodies and see if there's like a an answer you know that's been been arrived at so far
01:54:09 oh but then they're gonna say you remind me of Naruto with your body shape and just wear it
01:54:15 probably be like yeah this guy was like yeah i'm developing my style it's like this there's seven
01:54:20 billion fucking people out there most of us are fairly similar in most ways why would you even
01:54:27 think you were gonna make something unique enough to be noteworthy to like like i mean it's so
01:54:33 frustrating to me because like the the artists who are like oh don't compare me to other artists
01:54:37 it's like bitch have you like spent any time looking at art like there is no art i wouldn't
01:54:42 compare to another piece of art there is no fucking such thing as one i'm not going to do that too
01:54:47 it's a pretty immature like mindset to be like i i don't want to be compared to anyone else like
01:54:53 like that's an insult if if you want art tutorials and you're just starting out and
01:55:00 you like people who are cool this guy is very very cool which like five seconds of this video
01:55:06 and you'll understand that he's the only smart you art tutorial person in the world it's a very nice
01:55:11 spider-man it's a good peter parker oh i've seen this guy once or twice the only two mistakes you're
01:55:17 making what's well there's a gunbuster game for ps2 the way he delivers the information is like the
01:55:23 least boring and therefore the coolest and the best way to do art i don't like his go actually
01:55:28 listening i'll have to check it out that's i don't i will not watch this man because he has a goatee
01:55:33 but he has a butcher's knife he he puts he puts his microphone on a knife and he speaks into it
01:55:39 that's true you're not wrong about that it's pretty killer it's america i i just clicked
01:55:46 on youtube and i was watching american flag aviators you know this guy is with me on team joe
01:55:53 dude fucking oh yeah no doubt i'm watching this fucking ps2 get the point yeah go on go on yeah
01:55:59 say that yeah the point is that he's like a professional artist and his advice is really
01:56:03 good and he's also a really good youtuber and i like him sick so he's got two microphones one
01:56:08 clipped to a butcher's knife and then one that's just a microphone i i've seen this guy around but
01:56:13 yeah he does a lot of experimental stuff i don't know why i'm so mad at him click play on this
01:56:18 ps2 gun buster game gameplay to watch intense noriko sweeping action as she pushes a broom
01:56:24 around the fucking sports field i assume this is the end we see coach appearing on the top left
01:56:29 presumably to give her anime hype speeches as she does this this looks epic and i love it uh this
01:56:36 is made for the ps2 we gotta play this so this is made like decades after the original uh fascinating
01:56:42 this is delightful i kind of want to explore this uh okay but anyway i wonder if we've got one more
01:56:47 voice for the game or the capture card that is just like the frame rate is dog shit yeah i'm gonna
01:56:53 guess it's like emulating it i think so probably capture yeah okay one last voicemail and this one
01:56:58 is from uh oh it's simply called azumi is based you know uh tom mo i just wanted to say that
01:57:07 azumi is very based i absolutely love azumi uh it just looks so cool i don't know if it's a girl
01:57:16 or a dude but like i wish i could play the game but my computer doesn't have internet right now so
01:57:25 i can't really how did you say this um maybe a mobile port would be cool but that would probably
01:57:31 take a lot of work so uh what the fuck i don't know man this is pretty cool it's based
01:57:39 voice jail voice jail voice no i don't know i appreciate it what's wrong with that he got his
01:57:45 point across just fine i am but isn't it just a suggestion for the the man who wants to play on
01:57:52 mobile yeah just bluetooth game pad the demo has game pad support if you can hook up a game pad bluetooth
01:57:59 to your phone you can play it on your phone oh hey what the fuck do you know cool wait does
01:58:05 actually run on your phone then wait the game is on web app it's a web app right the game's on
01:58:10 new grounds right yeah it's on new grounds oh yeah it's on game jolt yeah right okay any of those
01:58:15 any of those there you go boom i was thinking like wait was there another release that i didn't play
01:58:19 yet i mean i updated it a couple like before ride con on new grounds yeah with like some
01:58:27 combos and better hits done can you continually update your like that link on new grounds with the
01:58:33 oh cool cool okay i was wondering is it me or were all these voicemails from the same guy some i
01:58:40 think i think this one and the good pcp content were from the same guy i think all the others were
01:58:46 from different people soundly like paradox now i don't like maybe it was no that's not paradox
01:58:51 what if you put one voicemail from a person in voice jail and the other one from the same guy in
01:58:58 voice grail does he get split is he like the emperor from final fantasy two who is his good
01:59:04 aspects are put into heaven and his bad ones went to hell and took over yes uh yes okay good
01:59:11 settle that all right voicemails leave more for us at the speak pipe link down below they
