00:00:00 Why dance around it? There are bad AVGN rip-offs.
00:00:03 Yeah, but then like they have like two minute intros and it's like he's a guy, and he plays a game.
00:00:09 And it's like just showing like their entire fucking collection of games and just literally like them bringing it up to the camera.
00:00:15 And then it'll just be like, Dragon's League is the game of the day.
00:00:21 You know exactly what I'm talking about!
00:00:23 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:27 I am Digibro. I'm going to be your host for today, and I have with me my co-hosts and friends.
00:00:33 Mr. Jesse Wood.
00:00:35 Roast beef and whiskey.
00:00:37 There you go. Roast beef and whiskey.
00:00:39 Uh, Hippocrit.
00:00:41 Siton.
00:00:45 Uh, the best guy ever, also known as Nate.
00:00:49 Or Guy.
00:00:51 And the DeVoo.
00:00:53 Aw yeah.
00:00:55 And today we're going to be talking about the subject of reviewer rules.
00:01:01 Now to explain what I mean by this.
00:01:03 We sure do.
00:01:05 We are the best.
00:01:07 To explain what I mean by reviewer rules, this is sort of a multi-part subject that we're going to go through one part and then the other.
00:01:13 We're going to be about rules that reviewers have for themselves or that people have for reviewers about how reviews are made.
00:01:21 Rule number one, don't be a reviewer. Do literally anything else creative.
00:01:27 Yeah.
00:01:29 That's a pretty good rule.
00:01:31 And the second half of this podcast we'll be talking about the rules which reviewers apply to shows.
00:01:37 Like what rules they have about what makes a show good and things like that.
00:01:41 And a lot of this is probably going to be us coming at these rules from a critical perspective of the rules themselves.
00:01:47 To start with DeVoo, I wanted you to talk about there's something that you called the reviewer rule that me and you get in our comments all the time and that we laugh about whenever we get it.
00:01:59 Do you remember this?
00:02:01 Is this like a definition that people post or something?
00:02:03 No.
00:02:05 DeVoo used to always complain because you have to be objective.
00:02:09 Sure.
00:02:11 It's the rule where they say, oh my god, this video is not objective and therefore it's bad or you're not being very objective.
00:02:19 You know it's funny about that.
00:02:21 It's a rule that carries over from back in the days of, well the current, it's the still living days of consumer reports.
00:02:27 They think you're supposed to be a consumer reports guy.
00:02:29 They think you're supposed to be an interviewer guy on the news media.
00:02:33 It's funny to me that people still make that kind of like demand.
00:02:39 They've sort of popularized like these objective reviews that are, you know, Steven Universe is a 10 minute long show.
00:02:46 It airs on Cartoon Network.
00:02:48 It was written by Rebecca Sugar and like, yeah, that's it.
00:02:50 Objective facts, yay.
00:02:52 And those are funny, but like it's because you don't want that.
00:02:54 You want their spin on it.
00:02:56 Well yeah, the perfect like criticism of the objective review was done by Jim Sterling.
00:03:01 His perfectly objective review of Final Fantasy XIII where it's just him describing the game.
00:03:06 And like making no value judgments at all.
00:03:09 And I think, yeah, there's a lot more people who understand that reviews aren't all about objectivity now.
00:03:14 But yeah, like DeVu said, people treat it like consumer reviews.
00:03:17 And like, yeah, and DeVu would always contact me and be like, oh, I broke the reviewer rule.
00:03:22 They're telling me I broke the reviewer rule.
00:03:24 Oh, you've come up with all sorts of rules.
00:03:26 Sometimes the rules get very specific.
00:03:28 Like your roller coaster video is bad because you talk about this aspect of the game first and the other aspect later.
00:03:34 You're supposed to do it in this specific way, didn't you know?
00:03:37 Didn't you get the memo?
00:03:38 And I'm like, no, I didn't.
00:03:41 Yeah, the thing about it, and DeVu, you had made this point to me very well,
00:03:46 where it's that these people who come to you with these rules, they don't know your goals.
00:03:53 They have their ideas of what you're supposed to be doing.
00:03:56 That's true.
00:03:57 That have nothing to do with what you think you're supposed to be doing.
00:04:00 People will come out and be like, oh, your reviews aren't very objective.
00:04:05 And I'm like, well, they're not supposed to be.
00:04:07 If you want objective reviews, go find another guy.
00:04:10 Like that's not what I'm doing here.
00:04:12 You're totally right.
00:04:13 That's interesting because I remember the first time.
00:04:15 I really think the first time I got into this at all was when my brother linked me.
00:04:20 Jesse's, what was it?
00:04:22 Crystal Empire review, like the Colt Corona one.
00:04:25 I think that was the first review I ever really saw that was way more than just talking about the thing.
00:04:31 And once I got into that, I got into all this other shit.
00:04:34 And it totally changed my perspective and made me look for a lot more out of reviews.
00:04:39 It was like, holy shit, they can do all this shit.
00:04:41 And I like to think that I try to incorporate.
00:04:43 But you didn't complain that it wasn't the kind of video you're used to.
00:04:46 I think a lot of these critical people think of themselves.
00:04:49 I didn't get it at first.
00:04:50 It took a little while.
00:04:51 This is a metaphor that Digi came up with in a vlog of his where these people like to think of themselves as they come into a sandwich place.
00:04:58 And they tell the cook, hey, the bread's a little bit burnt here and there.
00:05:02 The meat's a little bit dry here and there.
00:05:05 But really what they're doing is they're going into a sandwich place and saying, this pizza is very weird.
00:05:10 Sure, sure.
00:05:12 Yeah, and they don't get that they're doing that.
00:05:15 And they want reviews to be a very specific thing.
00:05:19 They have a very specific idea of what it's supposed to be in their head.
00:05:23 And yeah, they come in with their rules trying to apply them to your video.
00:05:28 And then, but here's the thing, is that a lot of them are reviewers.
00:05:33 And a lot of reviewers themselves follow these same rules and have these same ideas about what reviews are.
00:05:40 Yeah, yeah.
00:05:42 You know, when you watch people, like everyone seems to have their own ideas about like, this is how you're supposed to score a show.
00:05:49 And this is like, oh, you have to...
00:05:51 Nothing disgusts me more than like these arbitrary ass calcula...
00:05:54 Like, you know at Glass Reflections, this is the end of his and he's like, after doing the maths, I have calculated this is like a 2.5 episode.
00:06:00 It's like, shut up dude, just say it's pretty good.
00:06:02 Yeah, you know, and I used to have stuff like that when I was younger, like I was obsessed with scoring systems.
00:06:07 And I would try to come up with ones that were like, alright, well, you know, in my value system, story is worth this much and characters are worth this much and this is worth that much.
00:06:17 And I do all that, run all these calculations and stuff.
00:06:19 And then in the end, I realized that, A, I'm pretty clearly skewing my scores so that it will produce the result I already want, you know.
00:06:28 Like I watch a show and I'm like, that was like a 9 out of 10 and then I start doing math and I'm like, 8.7.
00:06:33 No, I've got to, well, I guess the characters were a little better than that.
00:06:37 That is a very telling exercise, yeah.
00:06:41 And those things, you can't just weigh each thing, like how the fuck do you separate characters from story?
00:06:50 Like how do you make those two different scores?
00:06:52 It doesn't make any sense, you know.
00:06:54 The story is the characters and vice versa, so it's really weird to try to do that kind of thing.
00:07:02 Do you think it'd be good to go around and talk about what we each sort of like to see in an ideal review?
00:07:08 Yeah, well first I want us to talk about stuff that we've seen other people do that they consider rules that we don't like.
00:07:17 Do you have any of those things where when other people say something in their review about like how they do it that you think, why are you doing it that way?
00:07:27 I think one thing that so many of them do, and it's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think it's a lot more interesting when they just leave it out, is the info dump at the beginning where they just talk about all the different things about the game setting it up.
00:07:42 Ben rails against the info dump, yeah.
00:07:44 It's just not interesting.
00:07:45 Even if I don't know about the game, I'd rather you just like, Davoo's videos are very good, they just get straight to the point and you talk about like a weird thing and I'm like, oh, that's cool.
00:07:54 I don't know anything about this game, but now I want to find out, you know.
00:07:57 I personally struggle with the info dump because I kind of enjoy hearing, if they can do it in a quick entertaining way, I kind of like it.
00:08:05 Matthew Matosis does it well, partly because his videos are long enough to warrant some establishment stuff.
00:08:12 If your video is five minutes long and you spend 30 seconds establishing the facts, wasting time.
00:08:17 It's a matter of like, what am I coming to you for?
00:08:20 Because again, like you said, the biggest problem is that people think of their stuff as consumer reviews, and it's all like they're trying to sell you something.
00:08:27 And so they feel like they have to tell you what the show is and then tell you whether it's good or not based on their ideas, you know, which of course a lot of them don't think of as their opinion.
00:08:39 They think of it as they have specific rules that we'll get into later in this podcast about what makes a show good, you know.
00:08:45 But like, that whole system is like, if I want the summary, I can go get that.
00:08:51 You know, like if I want to know what in general the anime is about, I can go read the chart and I'll already know.
00:08:58 So when they start off with like three minutes of literally describing the show, I'm like, okay, I want it.
00:09:03 I came to your video to hear your opinion of the show.
00:09:06 I already know what the show is about.
00:09:08 I have a thousand sources for that.
00:09:10 And what's strange is how confident a lot of these people are in the professionalism and informativeness of their content.
00:09:16 And I've just now realized maybe that's partly because the top dog video game YouTubers are first and foremost lets players who don't do a whole lot more than scream.
00:09:26 So they think, well, if I have any, if I even have a script, I'm miles above them.
00:09:30 And then of course the second tier is the normal boots hidden block people.
00:09:34 And those people just, a lot of them most of the time just play a game and make a bunch of jokes.
00:09:38 They're like, well, if I talk about anything of substance whatsoever, I'm brilliant.
00:09:42 And I talked to one reviewer who was like...
00:09:44 On an artistic level, it's true.
00:09:46 That's the thing, a lot of people don't really seem to set out to make something like Jesse did,
00:09:54 which is something that's like big and like entertaining in itself and tells its own story.
00:10:00 A lot of people are just like, I want to talk about the game.
00:10:02 I think people want to hear about it.
00:10:04 And it doesn't really matter how I do it.
00:10:06 And that's fine. You can do that.
00:10:08 But once I learned that there's all this other shit you can do when you're doing it,
00:10:12 it was like, Jesus Christ, everybody's playing checkers, but I've been playing chess for years.
00:10:18 I think there's a sort of mentality among a lot of reviewers where it's just like,
00:10:24 okay, I am a reviewer now and therefore my opinion on...
00:10:29 I have to give my opinion on everything in my purview.
00:10:32 I am now an anime reviewer, so I must review every anime.
00:10:36 And then it's just sort of they review whatever comes under their purview,
00:10:41 like a Glass Reflections type, where anything that's big and popular, he reviews it.
00:10:47 And he feels the need to apply the exact same formula to every review and review every show.
00:10:53 Well, I never got the idea that he would thought anything more of himself than just an informative anime guy.
00:10:58 So I think he's achieving his goals.
00:11:01 Let me double advocate here a little bit, did you?
00:11:04 What is this you speak of? Don't just talk about whatever comes into your purview.
00:11:08 Are you implying that there needs to be, or should be, ideally, some sort of relevance
00:11:13 or point to a video in its context of when it came out and the culture it's in?
00:11:17 Yeah, I think if you make a review, it should be...
00:11:23 I said this, I ranted about this in my Bloodborne Let's Play,
00:11:27 but in episode three, if anyone's curious, because I go on a huge rant and it's awesome,
00:11:32 but I was talking about how if your review of a show, like the end of it,
00:11:39 is that you say that there was nothing interesting about the show, then there's nothing interesting about your review.
00:11:45 I guess you could say why it's not interesting in a very entertaining way.
00:11:51 I don't think you can describe why you don't like something,
00:11:56 but that would make it interesting.
00:11:59 Sure, sure.
00:12:00 For instance, I've done this huge video series on the Asterisk War,
00:12:03 and while my conclusion is that the show is unbelievably boring,
00:12:07 the way that it's boring is interesting.
00:12:10 The way that they fuck up in everything, the way that everything's done.
00:12:14 But if you watch a show and you're like, eh, nothing about it really stood out to me,
00:12:19 then it's like, why did you have to tell us that?
00:12:22 We don't need to know that about the show.
00:12:25 But watch his Bloodborne video for much more and much louder version of this argument.
00:12:30 I just don't get why people feel...
00:12:34 I feel like people decide that I'm a reviewer now and therefore I have to give my opinion on absolutely everything
00:12:40 and apply the same system to everything.
00:12:44 The way I see it, every piece of art is different and deserves its own...
00:12:51 I guess now we can get into things we want to see from reviews, right?
00:12:55 Here's a big thing I want from reviews.
00:12:58 I want you to watch the show or play the game or whatever
00:13:02 and then talk about it in terms that make sense for that work.
00:13:07 Talk about it in a way that reflects what you're talking about.
00:13:11 Not necessarily that you have to go crazy like my Serial Experiments Lane videos
00:13:15 where it's like this huge experimental video style because it's the style of the anime,
00:13:19 but even if you have a lot to say about one show, write a two-hour video.
00:13:25 If you have a little to say about it, write a two-minute video.
00:13:29 If it's a show that's like a comedy and you don't know how to talk about it
00:13:35 in terms that you would talk about a drama, then don't talk about it in the terms you would as a drama.
00:13:40 Talk about it in new different ways and make each...
00:13:44 That's why all my videos have... there's no structure to them.
00:13:48 It's all like this one is this long because that's the kind of show it is.
00:13:52 Sometimes I talk about one aspect of a show because it's the only interesting thing.
00:13:58 And sometimes I talk about the whole show because all of it's interesting.
00:14:01 I think a big mistake that a lot of reviewers make especially at a young age like myself
00:14:05 is let's say they watch a movie and they think, wow, this is a 10 out of 10.
00:14:08 This is my new favorite movie and part of what I love about it is the character interaction.
00:14:12 And so then they chisel it down in stone.
00:14:14 To be a 10 out of 10, you must have great character interaction
00:14:18 because after all, how would that movie have achieved it?
00:14:20 But there could very well be a movie that comes out that is a 10 out of 10
00:14:24 just on its ideas, its philosophy, but it may not have very good character interaction.
00:14:30 So you give that other one a 10 if it excites you as much.
00:14:33 Like, Digi, you give a 10 out of 10 to Ghost in the Shell and Psycho Pass, both cyberpunk shows,
00:14:38 but one has better ideas and the other has a better story and characters.
00:14:43 And we'll get into that particular point later because that's what I want to talk about
00:14:48 with the rules reviewers have about shows.
00:14:51 But for now, I want to know more about your structural...
00:14:53 You know, one thing that I think is a mistake a lot of people make,
00:14:59 and I'm sure I have too, is, and it's related to what you were just saying before,
00:15:04 it's that thinking that everything they have to say because they made it a video
00:15:08 is inherently going to be interesting, is going to be something worth watching.
00:15:12 And that leads into my point.
00:15:14 When I watch a review, maybe I'm spoiled now because I've watched so many great
00:15:18 entertaining reviews as art pieces themselves,
00:15:21 I'm not really interested in just getting information.
00:15:24 I'm specifically looking for a great piece of art,
00:15:28 a big story told within the context of the review itself.
00:15:32 You know, I'm always searching for my next Anthony C's Cantralot wedding
00:15:38 because not only was that extremely well made in most ways,
00:15:43 Tom's voice sounds like shit just because the recording is bad,
00:15:46 but not only is it great, but it's got this incredible narrative that extends
00:15:50 even beyond it into these previous videos that all tie up in this one punch
00:15:56 that finally is delivered in that.
00:15:58 And also, I forget what I was going to say, whatever, it's really, really good.
00:16:03 And that's what I look for.
00:16:05 I want more of that.
00:16:07 That is the pinnacle of what, oh, I remember what I was going to say.
00:16:10 It teaches me something that I had no idea about.
00:16:13 It presents this argument that totally changes the way you could view this piece of work,
00:16:18 that, I mean, you could have possibly thought this before,
00:16:21 but it seems like something that he did research and he came up with justifications
00:16:26 that it could be true, and it was delivered in such an entertaining way
00:16:29 that doesn't seem just like a shitty conspiracy theory.
00:16:32 It feels like it could actually be something that was actually planned.
00:16:36 And it's just, it's a perfect storm of all the things that I want.
00:16:40 And I've yet to see a video since that day that really hit me as hard as that one.
00:16:44 And that video, like, has a narrative of the reviewer,
00:16:47 but there's also the reviewer can tell the narrative of the work.
00:16:50 I think YMS is the most acclaimed in this regard.
00:16:55 If he does one of his big YMS videos, often he talks more about the narrative of the movie's production
00:17:00 and release more than the narrative of the movie's plot.
00:17:04 Like in his, the one with Will Smith and his son, he goes on for like 15 minutes,
00:17:10 just talked about the context and where it came out.
00:17:13 So when you see a scene in that movie, you're not just thinking about the plot of the movie,
00:17:17 you're thinking more about why Will Smith and Imlight Shamblin put it there.
00:17:21 And that's a story that doesn't even exist in the movie.
00:17:23 It only exists in YMS's video.
00:17:25 And that's something that could only be introduced by a reviewer, which is pretty cool.
00:17:29 Yeah, I think-
00:17:30 Use the medium to its fullest.
00:17:31 Boyo?
00:17:32 That's right.
00:17:33 I think, like, for instance, Jesse Wood here is like kind of the master of having the narrative of the videos
00:17:39 is more interesting than the subject matter.
00:17:42 Because when Jesse reviews something, I'm not really, I don't care what Jesse's opinion of the thing is.
00:17:49 I care about how, or I guess I should put it, not that I don't care about his opinion of the thing.
00:17:53 Because Jesse always boils his opinion down to like, it was good.
00:17:56 I liked it.
00:17:57 Right.
00:17:58 And that's it.
00:17:59 And then it's everything else on top of it.
00:18:00 Yeah, the interesting thing about it isn't so much what I-
00:18:03 I tend to use the thing I'm reviewing as a gateway to analyze myself.
00:18:10 Yes, that's totally true.
00:18:12 And I love that because like, what I'm interested in is not what you're going to tell me about the show.
00:18:17 I'm interested in what you're going to tell me about yourself through the show.
00:18:20 Because like, what is a show but a tool with which we learn about ourselves?
00:18:24 Exactly.
00:18:25 Yeah, like, that's the main appeal.
00:18:26 Like, when I do my analysis videos, none of it is trying to get to the heart of what this show is and what it means.
00:18:34 And like, in terms of the creators, like, I do like using creative intent.
00:18:40 Like, I enjoy putting that in, like, I enjoy looking at it and putting it into my reviews.
00:18:45 But like, my goal is not to say how well did the guy who made this accomplish what he set out to do.
00:18:52 My goal is to say like, why do I react to this the way that I do?
00:18:56 Why does this make me feel the things I feel?
00:18:58 Why do people feel- why do other people feel the way they do about it, you know?
00:19:03 And like, because yeah, like you said, the point of art really, like the appeal of it is that it shows us something about ourselves.
00:19:10 Or it shows us something about the world.
00:19:12 But you say that because I'm just now realizing the problem with a lot of the reviewers that talk more about the objective stuff and the reason they're not as interesting is because they're not as egotistical.
00:19:26 They don't think that they should make the videos about themselves at all.
00:19:30 Yeah, not even egotistical, but like, self-aware.
00:19:33 I guess.
00:19:34 Like, introspective.
00:19:35 Well, I don't think I do that at all.
00:19:36 Like, in my videos, I just-
00:19:38 Um.
00:19:39 I don't think so.
00:19:40 I haven't tried.
00:19:41 If I have, I haven't planned it.
00:19:42 Uh-huh.
00:19:43 You do incorporate like your specific, I don't know, like your personality totally shines through in your reviews in a really great way.
00:19:50 I think with Hippocrite, I think it's built into the reviews because specifically of what games you talk about.
00:19:58 That's true.
00:19:59 Because you have exclusively covered like PS2 and PS1 games that are from like a very specific type of era and genre.
00:20:07 And I think that more than anything speaks, that gives it a narrative.
00:20:11 Because like, when I think of games Hippocrite likes, all I think is like, he's into PS2 platformers.
00:20:18 You know, like it's all like mascot platformers games like that.
00:20:21 And I think it inherently creates a narrative out of that.
00:20:25 Like, kind of like how, did any of you guys feel back in the day with Jon Tron, that whenever he talked about a modern game, it was really weird?
00:20:33 Because you were used to him just talking about like Super Nintendo and N64 games?
00:20:37 Yeah, that is weird.
00:20:38 Yeah, and so when he talked about like a new game, it was like, oh, Jon, I mean, I mean, logically you know he must play a new game.
00:20:45 Yeah, it doesn't feel as like Jon Tron when he did his like Final Fantasy XIII.
00:20:48 I like that.
00:20:49 I mean, it was great.
00:20:50 Sounds like a straight video.
00:20:51 Yeah, yeah.
00:20:52 It's always a little odd when he cut like a...
00:20:54 It's not what I expected.
00:20:55 Yeah.
00:20:56 Or that Valiant Hearts video.
00:20:57 That was the weirdest to me.
00:20:58 That was weird.
00:20:59 It was some random indie game thing that he bought and it's like, oh, you know, I'm used to you talking about like nostalgia and talking about classic games and talking, you know...
00:21:09 That was him like defying his own, like, what he had determined as the reviewer rules for himself.
00:21:16 That was him going, I mean, not that he had to.
00:21:18 I'm just saying...
00:21:19 I don't mind it, but I'm just saying that like, I just think that he had inadvertently created a narrative out of his videos where if you've seen the...
00:21:28 His Top 10 Super Nintendo games, for instance, where he goes on like this long, impassioned speech at the end about like, why these games were so special and why we feel nostalgia for them and stuff like that.
00:21:39 And then like, you look at all the rest of his videos and it's all these nostalgic games and like, it feels like that's what the point is in a way.
00:21:46 And then when he starts talking about like movies, then it's like, oh, I guess you also cover weird movies?
00:21:53 True.
00:21:54 Now that feels normal.
00:21:56 But when he initially saw that, it was definitely...it works for him, though.
00:22:01 That's why Jesse has multiple channels for multiple narratives.
00:22:04 Yeah, but I don't think that's ever really helped.
00:22:06 I think it always helps your...well, I guess it depends on what you're doing.
00:22:10 But in general, I think having him on one channel is helpful, you know?
00:22:15 I think it works out for Jesse because each channel has such a distinct personality where it's like, I mean, you can tell they're all him, but like...
00:22:25 My Japanese anime is one type of video and Endless Jazz is not that type of video necessarily.
00:22:32 And by the way, we're not just complimenting each other because we're friends.
00:22:35 We became friends because we like one other's videos.
00:22:38 So there's a reason why we're so biased, by the way.
00:22:40 I think all my channels are less connected by content or less distinctive by content in the yard by like, theme or attitude.
00:22:47 That's very true.
00:22:51 Shit, I forgot what I was gonna go on to.
00:22:54 We could let Gib give his thoughts because I don't think he really gave his about what he has for out of a...
00:22:59 And Jesse, both of you.
00:23:01 What are some things that you see either in other reviews that you don't like or that you wish more people would do in their reviews?
00:23:12 Is there some thing that you wish everyone would gravitate towards?
00:23:16 I hate scores, but we've already kind of talked about that.
00:23:20 Yeah, I don't know.
00:23:22 Most reviewers that are just sort of uninteresting to me, it's because...
00:23:30 I don't know.
00:23:32 Who are your favorites? Old John Tron?
00:23:34 Yeah, John Tron is pretty great.
00:23:36 AVGN is probably still my favorite.
00:23:38 Sure, sure.
00:23:40 He was great at creating a narrative out of the video just by where he was.
00:23:46 Davoo has often said that The Nerd's Basement is the greatest location in all of our viewers.
00:23:54 Well, except maybe Jesse's basement.
00:23:56 That's what I've said, Jesse's basement.
00:23:58 But The Nerd is a pretty second place.
00:24:00 Right, because with The Nerd, all he would do is show you two pictures of where he is,
00:24:06 and you immediately have this sense of, I'm in that room, I'm playing games with him.
00:24:12 He'll show you the old console, he'll show you the old TV he's playing it on,
00:24:16 he'll show you where he is, and you feel like you're in that room with him playing that game.
00:24:22 And I think a lot of people don't capture that because they try to do the same thing,
00:24:28 but they have normal looking rooms.
00:24:30 People are just, yeah, I'm in my room.
00:24:32 With The Nerd, you felt like you were in this place where time has not passed 1985 kind of thing.
00:24:40 He's playing on the old system, on the old TV.
00:24:44 In an old room.
00:24:45 And a lot of people, yeah, they kind of don't go all the way with that.
00:24:49 They'll just set up a set of Nerd stuff just barely in the frame of the camera.
00:24:55 I get pretty triggered every time I see a millennial standing in front of their Amiibo collection
00:25:01 and their Zelda poster.
00:25:03 It's just fucking in my life.
00:25:05 It's just not good cinematography when you can tell all their posters and figures begins and ends
00:25:10 within the frame of the camera.
00:25:12 Yeah, yeah.
00:25:13 I love, because Jesse will do these things with his set where he'll reorganize all of his posters
00:25:20 just for the sake of a video.
00:25:23 He built, I kind of copied this myself, but not nearly to the same extent,
00:25:28 where he sort of built each area of his room to be a different theme.
00:25:32 So like, there's a wrestling corner, there's like a pony corner,
00:25:35 there's a, you know, an Evangelion corner, and like, if he's talking about those,
00:25:40 like, go watch the Fuck Blue Ray video where it's like, he'd carefully put all the Eva figures on the desk
00:25:45 or the wonderful Waifus videos where it'll be like his Waifus corner.
00:25:49 The Waifus wall.
00:25:50 Yeah.
00:25:51 Yeah.
00:25:52 Very proud of it.
00:25:53 And like, and I like that because I like the idea that it's like,
00:25:57 it's not just that I wanted my collection in the background.
00:26:00 It's that there's a thematic relevance to my collection, you know.
00:26:03 Right.
00:26:04 And there's a video that I'm, we'll say, working on.
00:26:08 I've been trying not to talk about this video because I'm scared it won't get done if I do.
00:26:11 Sure.
00:26:12 But I started it off with like a collection shot, but I had the camera vertical,
00:26:18 like, because it's on my phone.
00:26:20 So I did like a vertical filming of just one shelf that has like all my DVDs on it
00:26:25 because I'm literally talking about my DVDs.
00:26:27 And then like, I walk into the frame and then I pan the camera and slowly until it takes up the whole frame.
00:26:32 So like, it's not me standing in front of my collection.
00:26:35 It's like, the collection is the subject of the video, you know.
00:26:39 Sure.
00:26:40 Sure.
00:26:41 That's of course totally fine.
00:26:42 Quite proud of the way I did that, but I don't know if anyone will see it
00:26:46 and know exactly what I'm talking about anytime soon.
00:26:49 I do like all that like live action stuff.
00:26:52 But I also do like the some people who just don't go on camera at all, like Matthew Matosis.
00:26:58 Yeah, yeah.
00:26:59 Like there's something about the fact that he's just talking about the game
00:27:03 and there's like nothing really about him.
00:27:05 Occasionally there's like a tiny glimpse into his, his emotions.
00:27:09 You know, I'm with you because that reminds me of something I hate,
00:27:12 which is arbitrary shots of you.
00:27:14 Like if you don't need to be in the video, like I'm working on a video now that I already recorded a big live action thing.
00:27:21 So like to justify that big ending thing, I need to start it with a live action thing or it'll be weird.
00:27:27 So it may, you know, it's going to work.
00:27:29 But like when people just start, they're like, hey guys, today we're talking about the new Zelda game that just came out.
00:27:34 It's pretty good.
00:27:35 Me and my friends have played it.
00:27:36 And then they end it with like, okay, everybody, thanks for watching.
00:27:38 Hope you'll stay and subscribe.
00:27:39 I got more Zelda videos coming next week.
00:27:41 Fuck Zelda, man.
00:27:42 Fucking.
00:27:43 Yeah.
00:27:44 Actually, I've remembered what I hate the most.
00:27:46 Oh, good.
00:27:47 Attempts at comedy when you're not very funny.
00:27:50 Yeah.
00:27:51 Please stop it.
00:27:52 I mean, I don't hate them for trying, but man, do I hate it when I hear them.
00:27:57 I hate them specifically for trying.
00:28:00 Trying to force things that you're not good at in general is annoying to me.
00:28:05 Like people start doing reviews and they get off the mindset that like, okay, I need a live action segment and I need a joke here and I need this because everyone else does that.
00:28:15 And then they'll get on camera and it's like, you can tell that they know they don't have the camera presence or the charisma yet.
00:28:22 It's that kind of copying the formula of someone without having the baseline skills.
00:28:27 And I do accept that to get good at something, you should probably do it if you want to get good at it, but it's also annoying and you shouldn't fuck you and don't do it.
00:28:39 I think a lot of it's a sign of like a lack of confidence in your own skills because like, this is the fastest way to get me to close out of your anime review.
00:28:46 And a lot of anime reviews in particular are like this because like, basically, I think that a formula got sort of created in anime reviews like early on and then everyone copied it where they all wanted to have like a really, really well produced intro, which is completely useless.
00:29:04 No, it's usually more like an artsy looking like, you know, like very clean, like legitimately well produced, but I don't want to see that.
00:29:14 Like I don't need 30 seconds of intro. I just want to know what the point of your fucking video is.
00:29:19 And then they'll always start off, like they'll start talking about the show and then they'll say, this is the number one line that'll make me close your video.
00:29:26 Insert joke about this here.
00:29:29 That phrase.
00:29:31 Anyone who says insert joke here and I'm like, so in other words, you don't have a joke, but you think you need a joke because you're not confident in your own skills as a reviewer.
00:29:43 You think that people will only watch a video who has jokes, but you don't have jokes.
00:29:47 So instead, you tried to make a joke out of the fact that you don't have jokes.
00:29:51 That's something you've encountered multiple times.
00:29:53 Oh my God, all the time.
00:29:55 I've seen it. I've seen it all the time.
00:29:57 I don't watch anime reviews that much. I don't seek them out.
00:29:59 Yeah. Well, there was a time where someone on Twitter posted every anime reviewer they followed just randomly and I was like, I'm just going to look at all these guys.
00:30:09 And then I just kept all of them had the same, because a lot of them had literally taken template elements that somebody made and everyone had the same DMCA opening screen thing where it's like, this is fair use.
00:30:23 They had the exact same fair use screen on multiple channels.
00:30:27 Create your own review software 2016. Just bad opinions.
00:30:31 Yeah. And then everyone feels like they need to have jokes, but then all the jokes end up being about how they're not funny.
00:30:38 And I'm like, stop. Stop. Take that out. I know you're not funny.
00:30:43 I think this is good advice, not just for reviews, but for anything.
00:30:49 Accentuate your positives and hide your negatives as much as you possibly can.
00:30:55 Yeah. I've been thinking like in the recent scripts I've been writing that I instinctively write a lot of jokes where it's like scream really loud, but I'm not very good at that.
00:31:09 I need to start cutting that down because I've seen stuff like Jesse's content where he screams, it's like, whoa, that's cool. That's really funny. I want to do that.
00:31:16 But I tried and I can't do it.
00:31:19 That process, anytime you do anything that you're going to, because it's great to take inspiration from other video makers or anything from life, but always ask yourself, what is the me version of this going to sound like?
00:31:33 Because when it comes to recording, I do a couple takes and I hate it, so I usually end up cutting it anyway.
00:31:40 Sometimes they get through.
00:31:43 Video editing process. Record something. Hate the whole thing. Trash it all.
00:31:48 This is why we don't get new hypocrite videos, if anyone was wondering.
00:31:53 Speaking of you complaining about insert joke here, I know you also have a beef with pronunciation of a word. How do I pronounce the word?
00:32:01 I don't know how to pronounce the word.
00:32:03 Did you complain about mispronouncing words?
00:32:06 No, no, no. It's the joke.
00:32:09 Yeah, it's when they go like...
00:32:12 Studio Ghibli? Studio Ghibli? I don't fucking know. I'm a gook. Hilarious.
00:32:18 It's like, and I know why they do it. It's to deflect people complaining about their pronunciation.
00:32:24 Because you've gotten a lot of that in some of your videos. You get that every day.
00:32:27 Yeah, I'm always getting complaints.
00:32:29 Those are fine. You can do that. Just don't dwell on it and just fucking motor past it.
00:32:33 I did one of the monster musume that was pretty much that, but I legitimately did not know how to pronounce that word.
00:32:39 I didn't fucking dwell on it. I just moved along.
00:32:42 Did you eventually just dealt with it and decided to start pronouncing everything right? Because you hate those comments so much.
00:32:47 That's a good way to go.
00:32:49 Sometimes I pronounce it right.
00:32:51 I have been more and more like, now I've been trying to say niche instead of niche, because people complain every time I say niche.
00:32:59 That's just how I pronounce the word in my everyday life.
00:33:03 But yeah, with the Eva videos that I did, I kept saying Eva and Gelyon, because that's just how I say it, and people were complaining about it.
00:33:11 In one of the videos I go,
00:33:15 And no one complained.
00:33:17 Yeah, no one complained, but also nobody got that that's why I was saying it that way.
00:33:21 It was to show that I know how it's really pronounced.
00:33:23 It is usually funnier to just mispronounce it deliberately.
00:33:27 That's true.
00:33:29 Hey bonus round, rule for commenters.
00:33:31 If you think someone else has already wrote the comment, either look for the comment and thumb it up or leave. Please.
00:33:36 We can do a whole other podcast about rules for comment.
00:33:39 That's a teaser for the rules for commenters, which will be probably 7 hours of us just talking about how much we hate everyone.
00:33:47 Yeah.
00:33:49 I think we could get every reviewer ever on board for that podcast. Everyone will have it.
00:33:55 Let's get PewDiePie in here, guys.
00:33:57 Oh god. He's got his own forum for comments.
00:34:00 Well to be honest, these days everyone's got their own subreddit.
00:34:05 We've got our own subreddit, guys. You can go click on it.
00:34:09 Link in the description. Go talk about it.
00:34:14 Alright, here's one that's a little bit deeper that I want to talk about about reviewer rules.
00:34:19 So we were discussing the idea of bringing up this podcast.
00:34:24 It's kind of fucked up that I'm going to do this when he wanted to be here and I didn't let him come on.
00:34:28 But Jeff Do of Mother's Basement was talking about how...
00:34:32 You didn't let him come in and he wanted to.
00:34:34 He was like, oh, because I said we were going to do reviewer rules and he was like, oh man, I want to be a part of that.
00:34:39 But I think he was more under the impression we'd be talking about rules that we want to follow as opposed to where I was thinking this is going to be us complaining about other reviewer's rules.
00:34:49 But he was saying that to him it's important that you either...
00:34:55 There's a distinction between recommending things and judging them based on what the creator's intent was.
00:35:05 He was saying a review should be about figuring out how well they did the thing they set out to do.
00:35:11 And I feel the total opposite of that.
00:35:14 And I think it's just not a review. I think that's a critique.
00:35:17 That's an interesting conversation to have, I think, about something.
00:35:20 Yeah, well, because I think a critique of something is where you look at what they tried to do and you judge them on that.
00:35:28 And I think the most ideal way to critique something is if it's literally they're in the room with you.
00:35:35 I think I would want something critiqued before I release it.
00:35:40 Let's say someone writes a video and they send it to me and they say, like, what do you think?
00:35:45 Then that's when I'm going to try to figure out, like, all right, well, what are you trying to say?
00:35:49 And here's how well I think you accomplished that.
00:35:52 And then you can put it out.
00:35:54 And there's an extent to which you can do that in video form where if you know, especially if you know a lot about the creator,
00:35:59 you know a lot about the background of the thing, then you can say, well, here's what they seem to be trying to do.
00:36:04 And here's how well they did it.
00:36:06 You can never really know because you're not the one who made it.
00:36:09 So it's always going to be taken.
00:36:11 And people treat those kind of reviews like those are the objective ones.
00:36:14 People treat those like those are the best kind.
00:36:17 It's like, oh, I'm judging how well they did their job.
00:36:21 And it's like, yeah, but you don't really know what their job was.
00:36:24 You don't really know.
00:36:25 A lot of people fancy the interpretive ones.
00:36:28 This is what that person really means in their life as like the most intellectual highbrow ones,
00:36:33 Aaron's signal, I guess, is doing.
00:36:35 And then he critiqued himself for doing it.
00:36:38 And I'm like, what the heck are you talking about?
00:36:40 If you don't know what they're like, then don't.
00:36:43 Just talk about what seems obvious and ignore anything that doesn't seem obvious.
00:36:47 And like, I mean, there's an extent to which you can like talk about what you think a creator like.
00:36:52 I did that whole Hidey Echiano video where I had some information to go on.
00:36:56 Right. And constantly throughout it, I'm like, by the way, this is all speculation.
00:37:01 I don't know Hidey Echiano, but here's some interesting things that you might think about him through what he said.
00:37:06 Sure. Or he'd be like taking like Suda51's games.
00:37:09 Be like, oh, he's clearly like misogynistic.
00:37:11 He fucking hates women. He's all about male empowerment.
00:37:14 He likes to jack off all the time.
00:37:16 Well, you don't fucking know the guy.
00:37:17 I made a pretty long video on Alexey Pajanov, the guy who made Tetris.
00:37:20 And I don't think I said anything about like, he's the kind of guy who would make this kind of game.
00:37:24 I just went down the list of all the games he made and tried to make him seem like a cool, funny guy because he is.
00:37:29 So I just wanted it and I just let him let anyone watching it think about him the way they would think about a normal person.
00:37:35 I didn't inject any of my own interpretation.
00:37:38 All right. Well, here's where I'm going to take this a little bit farther and maybe maybe you guys will contest me on this.
00:37:43 But OK, here's I think also that reviewing like, especially with video games, I think that reviewing just the version that came out and that was packaged by the company.
00:37:58 Is less relevant than reviewing the version that people will actually play with all the mods on it and stuff like I agree.
00:38:06 I think like, for instance, to give an example, like Super Bunny Hot made a video about Fallout 4, right?
00:38:13 And he was talking about he was critiquing the game and everything and like going in depth about it.
00:38:18 And then he says, like, you know, this game will probably get a bunch of mods that will make it way more interesting and better and playable.
00:38:26 Right. And like one of the things he complained about was the dialogue options and how they don't tell you the correct dialogue.
00:38:32 Right. Well, then like a day later, a mod comes out that fixes that.
00:38:36 So anyone who had, like to me, I think the most helpful review of Fallout 4 would be a review that says, hey, if you're going to play this game, download these mods.
00:38:48 Here's my experience now that I've done that, you know, because that's going to be, I think ultimately for, for instance, with a game like Skyrim.
00:38:55 Or like everyone plays it with mods, like no one just plays vanilla Skyrim on PC like past the first couple months that it was out.
00:39:04 And unless they're like someone who's a purist who only wants to play the pure version.
00:39:08 But like, I feel like we need the reviewer who comes in and says, all right, here's the version that you guys are actually playing.
00:39:16 And here's why that version is relevant to like culture, you know.
00:39:20 Super Bunny Hop is good about that in that he's not ignorant of that at all.
00:39:24 He's very willing to talk about it. And you know, I do actually like your suggestion a lot that he should do another review of it when like all the mods are out.
00:39:31 I think that'd be a very useful exercise.
00:39:33 But you know, really, I don't think that it's useless to do an initial release, but I think his goal for that video, and as he stated, was to talk about the game as it was released.
00:39:43 And I think it's fine to do that, but I just want to see more of both. And he is good about it.
00:39:48 Like he did a, he did his Metal Gear Solid 5 review.
00:39:51 Yeah.
00:39:52 And Jesus Christ, some fucking loud ass motorcycle.
00:39:55 He did his Metal Gear Solid 5 review and then he came back like two weeks later and did a video just about achieving 100% in the game.
00:40:02 Right.
00:40:03 Because he kept going.
00:40:04 Which is very interesting.
00:40:05 Right. And that's something that not, not everyone's going to do, but a lot of people, that's their version of Metal Gear Solid 5.
00:40:13 And like he gave voice to those people.
00:40:15 Yeah.
00:40:16 I think, I think my biggest problem with video game reviews is that the format of them, and especially with professional ones, like if you work for a review website, then you're encouraged to play this game in like two days.
00:40:28 Right.
00:40:29 Yeah. You'll probably give it a 10 out of 10 because it looks really good on the surface.
00:40:33 And the play, the gameplay is super tight, but oh, they fucked up the entire story. Oh, it has no real ending. Oh, it fucks up everything about the lore.
00:40:42 Oh, it's not replayable.
00:40:43 Turns out it's not that good.
00:40:44 Yeah.
00:40:45 You're trying these games at like reviewer events where everything is, you know, set up to make you like the game.
00:40:51 Or if you're someone who has to play a game every week, you know, then like your experience with games is not really what normal people's experience with games is.
00:41:00 And so many people critique the reviewer events thing, but they don't realize that just being a reviewer, a professional IGN game spot reviewer already colors your perspective quite a bit.
00:41:08 The funny thing is, you know, you know who those reviews are for? They're for other professional reviewers.
00:41:13 That's who those are useful for.
00:41:14 Yeah, like, and, you know, I've praised before how I love that Yahtzee, like, admits all of this up front in his videos.
00:41:23 He'll be like, hey, I only have a week to play this game. I didn't get very far in it, and it's not my kind of game.
00:41:29 Where he often will give his Game of the Year awards based on which games actually got him to play it for more than a week after he was done reviewing it, which makes perfect sense.
00:41:38 He says, my attention span has degraded to almost nothing as a result of being a reviewer.
00:41:44 So anything that I keep wanting to play for more than a week must be the best.
00:41:48 And like, I think that's great because I don't think a lot of people watch Yahtzee for his actual, like, as a recommendation.
00:41:58 I don't think many people watch him that way. People watch him because he's funny, and, you know, I don't think there's a lot of gamers who have the same taste as Yahtzee.
00:42:06 Like, he's so particular. He likes this certain type of narrative-driven, like, anything that's like Half-Life.
00:42:14 Like, the closer it is to Half-Life, the more he likes it, you know?
00:42:17 Half-Life 1, specifically, I think.
00:42:19 Yeah, both of them. He loves Half-Life 2.
00:42:21 Isn't his favorite game Silent Hill 2? That's his number one, right?
00:42:23 Yeah, Silent Hill 2, Half-Life 1, or Prince of Persia, like, those are like...
00:42:29 Yeah, Prince of Persia 2.
00:42:30 No, the first one.
00:42:31 Oh, really? Oh, okay.
00:42:32 No, 2 is not nearly as good as 1.
00:42:35 Well, Spider-Man 2, that's what it was.
00:42:38 That's like one of his, like, joke favorite games ever.
00:42:41 What, Spider-Man 2?
00:42:42 No.
00:42:43 Yeah, he's like, that's a game that he considers one of his favorites because of the experience he had playing it.
00:42:48 Well, whatever.
00:42:49 He had a top five list, but he thought it was a joke.
00:42:51 Spider-Man 2 is pretty awesome.
00:42:52 Yeah.
00:42:53 Alright, enough about fucking Yahtzee's favorite games.
00:42:56 Like, the point is that, like, he addresses the way that he plays the games, and I think more people should do that,
00:43:02 and I think we need more reviews that address the way people actually interact with art.
00:43:08 Yes.
00:43:09 That aren't us trying to say, like, well, here's what the creator and Ten did, and here's how well they did that,
00:43:13 because that's, like, totally irrelevant to any person watching your review.
00:43:17 Right.
00:43:18 Like, I think what your review should, like, and I mean, I'm not saying that every review should be this,
00:43:23 do whatever you want, you know, like, do whatever you're passionate about,
00:43:26 but I want to see more that are about, like, the cultural context of it,
00:43:30 and the way that people feel about it.
00:43:32 Like, if your review of Fallout 4 doesn't address the way that most people played it,
00:43:37 and the way that most people feel about it,
00:43:39 then who is it for?
00:43:41 Because it may be for some, it may be for a niche, it may be for the way you experienced it,
00:43:45 and there may be some people who relate to that, or outsiders who think it's interesting.
00:43:50 Like, I think, like, the Jesse-style, Anthony C-style that's my ideal is a niche thing.
00:43:55 It's not like everyone's looking for, like, epic stories in their reviews.
00:43:59 But Lord knows I want more of it.
00:44:02 Yeah, I just want more reviews that are, like, to me, the interesting thing about art is
00:44:07 how it speaks to the human condition, how it speaks to you personally,
00:44:11 how it affects you, and how you interact with it.
00:44:14 I guess the question is, do we count reviews as art?
00:44:17 I mean, obviously we do, but do people give a shit?
00:44:19 I absolutely think, and I think it, I think this argument has always been happening for all time,
00:44:25 and that we are on the right side of history.
00:44:28 But like, there's a classic, there's a huge write-up by Oscar Wilde called,
00:44:33 which, you know, this is from, like, 1890 or something, called, like, on criticism as art.
00:44:39 Like, it's a huge fucking thing.
00:44:42 It's presented as a conversation between two guys, where basically one guy is just telling this other guy
00:44:46 in extremely long-winded form that reviews are art, you know,
00:44:50 and like, he makes all the same points anyone else has made.
00:44:52 So as far as I'm concerned, like, this is a non-issue that's been around since the 1800s.
00:44:56 I gotta read that shit. That sounds awesome.
00:44:59 I couldn't make it through it, because it's very flowery.
00:45:02 I obviously agree that a review can be art.
00:45:06 But I don't think that reviewers should just consider themselves artists as a matter of fact.
00:45:13 Sure, sure.
00:45:14 It's, I mean, for one reason or another, I don't feel as creatively fulfilled.
00:45:19 In general, I do have a severe lack of respect for criticism in general.
00:45:25 Yeah.
00:45:26 It's a weird thing. If I, like, draw a picture, even if it sucks, I'm like,
00:45:29 yeah, if I make a video, even if it's pretty good, I'm like,
00:45:32 alright, I'm not quite as into it.
00:45:34 It never gives me quite the same high.
00:45:37 In order for me to feel like a review has become, has value beyond being a critique,
00:45:46 is if it adds anything of its own that's creative or interesting beyond the deep portion of it.
00:45:53 I absolutely regard all of my videos as high art, so.
00:45:57 Well, so do we all.
00:46:00 Well, because I like, like, to me, I enjoy analysis videos almost more than I enjoy media.
00:46:07 You know, like, I spend most of my time watching YouTube analysis videos.
00:46:12 So, like, to me, some of those are some of my favorite things.
00:46:15 Some of those are more rewatchable, you know?
00:46:17 And like, if it was something like Sequelitis, you could make the case like,
00:46:20 yeah, well, it's also funny, and it's got obvious artistic elements.
00:46:24 But then with something like a YMS video, like the After Earth one that DeVu was talking about,
00:46:29 like, that's one of my favorite videos because of what he brought to it.
00:46:34 Like, even though it's just about the movie, it's just about the context,
00:46:38 but the way it's presented, it's basically a documentary.
00:46:40 And I think documentaries are art, you know?
00:46:42 Like, it's about taking the work that exists and then making something out of it.
00:46:48 And I think making art is generally that anyways.
00:46:53 You're taking something that's in your head and you're making something out of it.
00:46:56 You're taking the world around you and you're making something out of it.
00:46:59 I think that's fucking copyright infringement and everyone who does that needs to get shut the fuck down.
00:47:04 Yeah.
00:47:05 Well, before we move on from the list of things, rules for reviews,
00:47:12 I do have a big list that I jotted down.
00:47:17 Oh, cool.
00:47:18 Oh, let's hear it.
00:47:19 Of things that piss me off in reviews.
00:47:21 And there's quite a few of them.
00:47:23 I'll get through them all.
00:47:24 I preemptively apologize.
00:47:25 I'll elaborate on the ones that need elaborating.
00:47:28 And before anyone in the comments tries to catch me in some active hypocrisy or contradiction,
00:47:35 I will admit up front that in the past I have been guilty of some of these things
00:47:40 and arguably continue to be guilty of some of these things,
00:47:44 but there's still things that I fucking hate.
00:47:46 Art hypocrites are boring anyway.
00:47:48 So anyone in the comments section trying to scream,
00:47:50 gotcha, you can blow me, you can all go right to hell.
00:47:53 Okay.
00:47:54 Now that we've primed them for the list, let's hear it.
00:47:57 So the first thing I wrote is jump cuts.
00:48:00 I hate jump cuts.
00:48:01 They should never exist for any reason.
00:48:03 But Jethy, you've done jump cuts.
00:48:05 I've seen them in your videos.
00:48:07 Yes, you have.
00:48:08 Come on.
00:48:09 Well, I have a contingency for my use of jump cuts
00:48:14 because I only use them in Man Child Incorporated,
00:48:16 which is specifically designed to have no soul
00:48:19 and to be a satire of soulless channels,
00:48:22 even though I fail at that because I can't make videos with no soul.
00:48:25 Jethy, why didn't you film Horseshoe Finale in one take?
00:48:28 Why wasn't that a one take video?
00:48:30 Your editing was lazy and I think you should step up your game.
00:48:34 No.
00:48:35 What?
00:48:36 No.
00:48:37 No, shut up.
00:48:38 One take, Jethy.
00:48:39 How would he do all the customizing?
00:48:40 First of all, motherfucker, I did film it all in one take.
00:48:42 Every fucking shot in that video is a fucking five minute rant,
00:48:46 at least, that I did in one fucking take.
00:48:48 The only reason I didn't just cut that all
00:48:50 is because I don't have the power to teleport around my fucking room.
00:48:53 All right, stop arguing with Nate's fake straw man
00:48:56 and get back to your points.
00:48:59 Anyways, jump cuts are obnoxious and alike.
00:49:02 If you jump it around the room, you're just fucking stupid.
00:49:05 If you have a script, you should fucking memorize your script
00:49:09 and put some goddamn effort into it.
00:49:11 I don't need you cutting every fucking sentence.
00:49:13 Alternatively, there's two easy solutions that get rid of jump cuts.
00:49:17 You do one of them a lot, which is just,
00:49:20 if you don't have to do jump cuts, just cut to not you.
00:49:24 Like, cut, if you can't memorize the whole script,
00:49:28 say the first paragraph on camera,
00:49:30 say the second paragraph on a microphone,
00:49:32 say the third paragraph on camera.
00:49:34 You can cut back and forth.
00:49:35 You can find creative ways to get around it
00:49:37 without fucking just jumping to yourself from yourself.
00:49:40 Method number two, be somewhere else.
00:49:43 I've done this where I've recorded each paragraph
00:49:46 with a different, like, instead of jump cutting,
00:49:49 I'm just not in the same place anymore.
00:49:52 It looks like I changed backgrounds
00:49:54 and now it's a new place and I'm saying the next paragraph.
00:49:56 I guess to be specific, I'm not talking about cuts in general.
00:49:58 I'm talking about specifically...
00:50:00 Well, I'm just saying that cuts are how you get around jump cuts.
00:50:03 If we take this long to talk about every point,
00:50:05 we're gonna be here all night.
00:50:06 I don't care how long we take.
00:50:07 My points are gold, baby.
00:50:09 It's gonna be as long as it needs to be, all right?
00:50:11 Okay.
00:50:12 I'm leading this discussion, god damn it.
00:50:14 That's true.
00:50:15 The next thing I wrote down is a big one for me,
00:50:18 a big pet peeve, unscripted, stammering, stuttering bullshit.
00:50:23 Jesse, why don't you want people to be real?
00:50:25 Why are you trying to put people in a box?
00:50:27 Just let them be real on camera, Jesse, huh?
00:50:29 If you can't be articulate, you don't deserve to be real.
00:50:32 If you're in front of a camera, like, fucking,
00:50:35 alpha, mega-sin, and every other word out of your mouth,
00:50:38 you can't even form a complete sense.
00:50:41 Yeah, exactly.
00:50:44 Again, play to your strengths.
00:50:46 Don't play to your weaknesses.
00:50:47 Don't be a YouTuber just because you think being a YouTuber is cool.
00:50:50 Do it because you actually are articulate,
00:50:52 and you couldn't do this.
00:50:53 Not to throw shade on any other YouTubers in particular,
00:50:56 but when I'm going down the list of things I hate,
00:50:58 it's gonna be kind of unavoidable.
00:51:00 Fuck that guy.
00:51:01 I think it's fine to give an example.
00:51:02 Then people can see what you're talking about.
00:51:04 Yeah, alpha, mega-sin is really bad at that.
00:51:06 His videos always lose me in the first minute.
00:51:09 I can't get through them,
00:51:10 because he just can't put a sentence together.
00:51:12 Yep, it's bizarre, and that's what people subscribe for.
00:51:15 He's inarticulate rambling, but whatever.
00:51:17 Let's move on.
00:51:19 The next thing is lack of self-awareness.
00:51:22 Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
00:51:24 Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
00:51:25 Now, I'm a firm believer of anything on this list
00:51:30 that I'm going to complain about,
00:51:31 you can get away with it if you're self-aware about how stupid it is,
00:51:35 which is something that I have utilized to great effect numerous times.
00:51:39 I do stupid shit in my videos,
00:51:41 but it's always with my tongue in my cheek,
00:51:45 and that's where your tongue should be.
00:51:47 You shouldn't...
00:51:48 Okay, I've explained that one enough.
00:51:50 Yeah.
00:51:52 The next one.
00:51:53 Tongue punching the brown eye.
00:51:55 The brown eye, not my ass cheek.
00:52:02 What the fuck?
00:52:05 Yeah.
00:52:07 Dismissiveness of other viewpoints or opinions.
00:52:10 Ding, ding.
00:52:11 Sorry.
00:52:12 Oh, man, yeah.
00:52:13 That one, that will kill me.
00:52:15 You don't have to start every review with,
00:52:17 by the way, this is subjective and it's just my opinion.
00:52:19 I'm not saying you have to do that,
00:52:21 but don't do the opposite either.
00:52:23 Don't be like, if you like this, you're stupid.
00:52:26 That's gay.
00:52:27 You're gay to do that.
00:52:28 Yeah, that's pretty gay.
00:52:29 If you like saying, if you like this, you're stupid, then you're stupid.
00:52:32 Oh, and then when you're called out on it, don't own up to it.
00:52:34 Don't just say, oh, I'm just having fun.
00:52:36 Oh, yeah.
00:52:37 That's the part of reflection thing that happened.
00:52:39 Yeah.
00:52:40 Yeah, this kind of part of reflection has made this...
00:52:42 This is what I ran to him about in the Blood Board video
00:52:44 if you haven't watched it already,
00:52:45 but he just kind of took potshots at Kayon
00:52:48 and then was like, oh, but I'm sure people like it for a reason.
00:52:51 And I was like, dude, what the fuck, man?
00:52:53 You're clearly insulting the people who like this show
00:52:56 and then trying to play it off like they're not.
00:52:58 He was taking potshots at the people who like it for just being weirdos.
00:53:00 That's true.
00:53:01 He specifically insulted people who liked it, so that's not cool, bro.
00:53:04 Yeah, I mean, you're...
00:53:06 I think any self-importance of that kind is really annoying in a review
00:53:11 where it's like, I'm the arbiter of what taste is
00:53:14 and it's like, dude, you're just some guy who has an opinion.
00:53:18 Your opinion might be interesting
00:53:20 and a lot of people might feel the same way that you do,
00:53:22 but you are not the arbiter of taste.
00:53:25 I mean, this is what that anime snob's entire career is.
00:53:28 Which it goes back to lack of self-awareness.
00:53:31 You should have, as a critic, you should have the self-awareness
00:53:35 to know that your word is not fucking law.
00:53:37 And then act on that self-awareness by acting self-aware.
00:53:40 Don't just be self-aware or claim you are.
00:53:42 No one's gonna know if you are self-aware and just don't do anything with it.
00:53:46 Well, I think that's what Davoo is saying.
00:53:47 It's like that departed reflections guy was like kind of claiming that like,
00:53:50 hey, it's just a joke, bro.
00:53:52 I'm not taking my videos that seriously.
00:53:55 You need to modify your content to make the videos.
00:53:59 Right, right.
00:54:01 Alright, the next one is the big pet peeve of mine,
00:54:03 and even bigger than the last one that was big.
00:54:06 And that's the recap reviews.
00:54:08 And I'm talking specifically about the That Guy with the Glasses Doug Walker formula,
00:54:12 where you're fucking, instead of actually writing a think piece
00:54:16 or an editorial or a fucking opinion about something,
00:54:19 instead you go through the whole goddamn movie,
00:54:22 scene by scene, for 25 fucking minutes,
00:54:25 and just every scene you gotta make some glib comment about,
00:54:29 like, the way that the nostalgia critic does.
00:54:31 Every one copies it, and it's a horrible fucking format.
00:54:35 You know, the only thing...
00:54:36 Yeah, no, you're totally right.
00:54:38 And that was really bad when he would just play footage and do that.
00:54:41 I like that he now does like all live-action reenactments.
00:54:44 That in itself is kind of cool, but the formula is garbage.
00:54:48 Like, I understand that people want to copy him because he's popular,
00:54:52 and everybody starts out copying somebody, but...
00:54:55 Just remember, everyone's copying it because it's the easiest format.
00:54:59 If you're gonna copy someone's format, copy any other format.
00:55:03 That's a terrible way to critique something.
00:55:06 It's an okay format for movies, because John Tron did that with Birdemic.
00:55:10 He just went through it, and he made jokes.
00:55:12 But he's so funny, you know?
00:55:13 I know, he made up for it with the jokes.
00:55:15 I think, and we kind of discussed this last night when we were just talking,
00:55:19 but I think the only value for that is when it's something that no one's heard of,
00:55:25 then going through the whole...
00:55:27 If you're talking about some completely forgotten piece of 90s garbage
00:55:32 that no one remembers, and then you describe the whole thing...
00:55:36 Because that's kind of what YMS does, is that he'll take a shitty movie that no one watched,
00:55:41 and then he'll break it down every single scene.
00:55:43 By all means, go ahead and do it.
00:55:45 That was my first introduction to The Room, watching Nostalgia Critic's video on it,
00:55:48 and I loved that video because I had no idea what The Room was, and it was like,
00:55:52 holy shit, this is amazing.
00:55:53 I think when you start applying that formula to reviews of shit that people actually are watching,
00:55:59 then it's like, we all know what the movie was.
00:56:03 You're not pulling the veil over our eyes with the way you're describing it.
00:56:08 If Ben were here, he would be screaming about how much he hates it.
00:56:12 And railing against the heavens about this point.
00:56:15 Ben, I'm here for you, brother.
00:56:17 Just like me, do that format. Any actual content is incidental.
00:56:20 Any analytical point will just happen at some random point in the video
00:56:24 based on when it happens in the plot.
00:56:26 At the end, Doug Walker always does...
00:56:28 At the end, he'll be like, wait, I understand now.
00:56:31 It all makes sense to me, and then he'll play the sad music,
00:56:34 and be like, you know, at the end of the day,
00:56:36 maybe Mad Max isn't about angry men and lesbian women.
00:56:40 It's about being a family, or whatever, you know?
00:56:44 Yeah, some completely obvious conclusions.
00:56:46 And it doesn't even make...
00:56:48 It doesn't logically follow from what happens,
00:56:51 or it's so obvious that there was no need to do any of this.
00:56:55 So, fuck off, Doug.
00:56:56 Bonus rule, don't make your points more dramatic
00:56:59 and make it out to be more interesting than they are, unless that's the joke.
00:57:02 You have to justify it.
00:57:04 If you're going to play the sappy music, you better have a good fucking reason.
00:57:07 Something interesting.
00:57:08 Biggest critique I think we all have of Nerdwriter.
00:57:11 This is a good point.
00:57:12 Yes, overly sappy shit when it is not justified is a huge trigger.
00:57:16 Like the Planket Reviews of Star Wars,
00:57:19 he waited until, you know, two and a half hours
00:57:21 and then really lay down the big...
00:57:23 Yeah, and it was epic.
00:57:24 The payoff was fucking...
00:57:26 Oh, yeah, it's the best.
00:57:27 And I like to think I achieved something similar
00:57:29 in my Girl and Login video with its 40 minutes,
00:57:31 and then at the end, it all ramps up to it's like,
00:57:34 holy shit, guys, boom, you've listened to this shit.
00:57:37 Yeah, you know.
00:57:39 Alright, Jesse, continue your list.
00:57:41 Alright, the next one, I needed some clarification for it
00:57:44 because I'm a big doer of this.
00:57:48 That's a stupid way.
00:57:50 I'm Alpha Omega Cent right now.
00:57:52 I can't...
00:57:56 Continuity, specifically high stakes continuity.
00:58:00 Now, I'll explain what I mean by this.
00:58:02 I do continuity in all my videos.
00:58:04 Every fucking thing I put out
00:58:06 has some kind of connection in it,
00:58:08 because that's what I like, and it's fun and it's cool.
00:58:12 But the storylines or the stories that I'm telling
00:58:16 are all very low stakes.
00:58:18 They're just about me being an idiot and a crazy person
00:58:22 and living in my own madness here in a fucking basement.
00:58:26 What I hate is when people, again, no self-awareness,
00:58:29 they take it so seriously,
00:58:31 like you'll watch a Linkara video or a Nostalgia Critic video,
00:58:34 and some guy comes into the gun,
00:58:36 and he's like, we gotta save the world
00:58:38 by reviewing this fucking movie from 20 years ago.
00:58:41 It's the only way to stop the evil overlord,
00:58:43 and the evil overlord is just like him in a different hat.
00:58:46 Yeah, yeah.
00:58:47 If it's self-aware, it can be okay.
00:58:49 Yeah, there's sort of things that did start as a joke,
00:58:52 but they've kind of become the norm a lot.
00:58:55 Especially with the AVG in it.
00:58:58 They all do that sort of...
00:59:00 It started with the AVG as a joke.
00:59:02 There's no reason this should happen, and it does.
00:59:04 Now, we don't have to go too elaborate on stories,
00:59:06 because if you want a definitive, full, complete list
00:59:09 of everything to not do in a review story,
00:59:12 watch the Game Over Thinker episodes 43 through 100.
00:59:16 That will teach you everything to not do ever.
00:59:18 The Game Over Thinker is the perfect example of don't.
00:59:21 The thing is, I think that continuity can be great,
00:59:25 but each of your videos should be watchable
00:59:28 and comprehensible on its own.
00:59:30 If you're watching them all, unless it's the end...
00:59:33 With the Horseshoe Finale, for instance, that Jesse Wood did,
00:59:36 every video leading up to it made sense by itself,
00:59:40 and then Horseshoe Finale was just the ending of the story.
00:59:43 Horseshoe Finale might not make sense on its own,
00:59:46 but it's also not about anything else other than the story.
00:59:49 It's not an episode review that became a film.
00:59:53 It is a film about the story,
00:59:55 and it's made for the people who are following it.
00:59:58 I think with Game Over Thinker,
01:00:00 he'll put out a video that's called
01:00:02 Why Mario's Cool, and then you start it,
01:00:05 and there's 10 minutes of him fighting
01:00:07 three evil versions of himself in a CG background,
01:00:10 and you're like, what the fuck?
01:00:12 What does this have to do with Mario?
01:00:14 I'm all for continuity, I'm all for stories and skits,
01:00:17 but, guys, you are not saving the fucking Earth dimension
01:00:21 from a goddamn ninja by reviewing a fucking movie.
01:00:24 So while we're on MovieBob,
01:00:26 let's talk about something I've been guilty of,
01:00:28 is putting in something in your review
01:00:31 that makes sense as part of your opinion to you,
01:00:35 but you don't explain why it's relevant to your review,
01:00:38 and that's something that MovieBob does a lot.
01:00:40 Oh, like he sticks to his social justice agenda all the time.
01:00:43 That was actually the very next thing on my list.
01:00:46 Intrusive politics.
01:00:48 And that one means no explanation at all.
01:00:50 Your fucking opinions on politics do not belong in a review.
01:00:53 Well, okay, hold on.
01:00:55 Unless they do.
01:00:57 I think it does need clarification.
01:00:59 That's why I clarified intrusive politics.
01:01:01 Sometimes the politics are interesting,
01:01:03 and that's the point.
01:01:05 With MovieBob, with his really that good videos,
01:01:08 there's always a point in the video
01:01:11 where the politics are important,
01:01:14 where with the Spider-Man video,
01:01:16 he gets into this 9-11 part,
01:01:18 and it's like that was relevant to the story of the movie,
01:01:21 but then there's parts where he'll just be like,
01:01:23 you know, and if you're a Republican,
01:01:25 you're a fucking idiot moving on to the next point,
01:01:27 you know, and you're just like, what was that?
01:01:29 Like, why is that there?
01:01:31 Yeah, like his Independence Day review was like,
01:01:34 Independence Day came out in the 90s,
01:01:36 and now it's, you know, the 2010s,
01:01:38 and there's lots of things that have happened since then.
01:01:40 Bill Clinton has been great,
01:01:42 George Bush has been terrible,
01:01:44 and people have been racist against Obama.
01:01:46 That's all the American history that's happened between them.
01:01:48 That was the most violent rage quit I've ever had on a video, I think.
01:01:51 Yeah, it was pretty bad.
01:01:53 Alright, Jesse, next point.
01:01:55 Wait, I want to go back to your last point,
01:01:57 just real quick about the, about the stakes in videos,
01:02:00 because I want to bring up one of my favorite examples
01:02:03 of how to do it right ever,
01:02:05 which is, it was just Pinky Pride.
01:02:08 Yeah, it was in Pinky Pride,
01:02:10 and now it also includes the Crusaders of the Lost Mark episodes
01:02:13 of My Little Pony,
01:02:14 where the stakes are like,
01:02:16 incredibly low, right?
01:02:18 You don't need to do anything,
01:02:20 but it's like the tension in the thing is built up
01:02:22 in such a way that you really, really fucking care about it.
01:02:25 Everyone should learn from that example,
01:02:27 but okay, let's move on.
01:02:29 After intrusive politics,
01:02:31 it's intrusive skits.
01:02:33 Again, I'm all for skits.
01:02:35 I think they have a place, obviously,
01:02:37 but they shouldn't overtake the subject of the video.
01:02:40 I think the best guy who does skits,
01:02:43 besides me, of course,
01:02:45 on YouTube is Anthony Fantano.
01:02:48 Yeah.
01:02:49 All of his skits are like only a few sentences,
01:02:51 and they're just there, and they're funny, and...
01:02:53 But Anthony!
01:02:54 Yeah, exactly.
01:02:55 Review is, should be,
01:02:57 ten a thing,
01:02:59 and you even do everything.
01:03:01 Anthony, why you do this?
01:03:03 Shut up, Cal.
01:03:05 Anyways, back to the review.
01:03:07 Hello, everyone.
01:03:08 If you want to put skits in your videos,
01:03:10 why not?
01:03:11 Put skits in your videos,
01:03:13 watch Anthony, and take a note from him.
01:03:15 He's a good example.
01:03:17 They're like little golden nuggets,
01:03:19 because you never know if there's going to be one in a video.
01:03:21 Then when you see one, it's like,
01:03:23 yeah, actually, I kind of,
01:03:25 sometimes I'll get frustrated when there isn't enough,
01:03:27 like, Cal, and I'll just be like,
01:03:29 whatever, fuck this guy, I just want to see Cal.
01:03:31 But, yeah.
01:03:32 And I've taken a page out of the book.
01:03:34 Since I've started watching Anthony Fantano,
01:03:36 I've tried to make my skits more to the point.
01:03:39 Like, if you watch, like, my 2012 shit,
01:03:41 or my, you know, my old shit,
01:03:43 there's a lot of meandering bullshit.
01:03:45 Sure, sure.
01:03:46 Fantano highlights something really good
01:03:48 that reviewers can be, which is unpredictable.
01:03:50 Because I think some, that guy with the glasses type people,
01:03:53 they think, well, now that I have
01:03:55 a certain amount of narrative, I need to have
01:03:57 exactly three and a half minutes of skit
01:03:59 at the beginning of every video.
01:04:01 Whereas Anthony can be anything.
01:04:03 The universe of the needle drop
01:04:05 is like this unpredictable thing that's breaking.
01:04:07 Well, his April Fool's joke spawned this whole saga
01:04:09 about how Cal is dead and in hell
01:04:11 and made a contract with Satan.
01:04:13 And he incorporated that into his fucking, like,
01:04:15 pretty serious album reviews.
01:04:17 And it was great, everything about it ruled.
01:04:19 And it matches his editing style, where, you know,
01:04:21 the editing spazes out to cover up his mistakes.
01:04:23 Anthony, I made a deal with the daemon.
01:04:25 I got a burden, my doctor shows.
01:04:27 Everything about that was fantastic.
01:04:29 Got to pat the guy in the back.
01:04:31 Um, the next thing on the list
01:04:33 is derivativeness.
01:04:35 I'm not sure if derivativeness
01:04:37 is a word, but...
01:04:39 Don't be derivative.
01:04:41 Um, don't...
01:04:43 Nothing triggers me more
01:04:45 than when I find a new guy on YouTube
01:04:47 who is a blatant rip-off
01:04:49 in every way of someone else.
01:04:51 Yo, how about that demo-declone guy, right?
01:04:53 You know, I was about to bring him up.
01:04:55 I actually follow him on Twitter.
01:04:57 He actually seems pretty okay.
01:04:59 Yeah, we all left shitty comments
01:05:01 on this guy's video one time, because
01:05:03 he didn't do much, like, demo.
01:05:05 And demo is great. I didn't even hate that about it.
01:05:07 It was just, you know, it's like...
01:05:09 Well, that's the thing.
01:05:11 The thing about Departed Reflections is that, like,
01:05:13 he doesn't necessarily make bad videos,
01:05:15 with the exception of that K-On one.
01:05:17 But, like, the worst thing about it
01:05:19 is how he's cribbing demo
01:05:21 and not demo.
01:05:23 Because demo has an amazing voice
01:05:25 and a great microphone and a lot of charisma.
01:05:27 And this guy has none of those things.
01:05:29 He sounds like he's recording
01:05:31 like a muffled fucking, you know,
01:05:33 basically...
01:05:35 I have a pretty...
01:05:37 I only watched the 30 seconds of the K-On video,
01:05:39 but I have a very specific reason
01:05:41 as to why his demo impersonation
01:05:43 bothers me. It's because he's not doing it
01:05:45 for the same reasons as demo.
01:05:47 Demo does it. I don't know why, for sure,
01:05:49 but I infer demo does it
01:05:51 because it's an easy way for him
01:05:53 to sound charismatic
01:05:55 and fluent and read scripts well
01:05:57 because he probably tried reading everything like this
01:05:59 and it didn't come out well. He probably tried
01:06:01 reading everything like this.
01:06:03 I don't think demo writes any of his scripts.
01:06:05 Well, he tried to present himself
01:06:07 and that was the way that came out naturally to him
01:06:09 and helped him make his point.
01:06:11 I think the reason that demo sounds that way
01:06:13 is that only certain sentences are actually written
01:06:15 and he just kind of sits in front of a microphone
01:06:17 and then thinks of...
01:06:19 Because that's how I did my...
01:06:21 When I did a demo-style video, the one that's
01:06:23 Should You Watch Kaiba, there's no script for that.
01:06:25 I sat in front of a microphone
01:06:27 and played something in a really low voice
01:06:29 and it matched his flow.
01:06:31 And the flow of his
01:06:33 of his videos fluctuates based on
01:06:35 a point he wants to make. Let's just say
01:06:37 there's a show where a character gets killed
01:06:39 and it doesn't make any sense.
01:06:41 So he might say it like this.
01:06:43 So then she goes up into the cabin
01:06:45 and then she gets killed.
01:06:47 He might speed up all of a sudden
01:06:49 because that makes the point.
01:06:51 Whereas the first 30 seconds of the departed reflections
01:06:53 a guy, he goes,
01:06:55 he's been really busy at work
01:06:57 and school.
01:06:59 He has this big pause between work
01:07:01 and school. There's no reason
01:07:03 you could just say, I've been busy...Demo
01:07:05 if for whatever reason he was going to announce that
01:07:07 would have said, hi guys, I've been busy
01:07:09 with work and school.
01:07:11 Alright, you just reminded me of the biggest pet peeve I have
01:07:13 with all YouTube videos ever. It's when they start
01:07:15 their video and they're like, hi guys,
01:07:17 sorry I haven't made a video in a while.
01:07:19 Oh god, that's a really busy way.
01:07:21 That's really high on my list.
01:07:23 I don't even know yourself at that point.
01:07:25 I don't even know.
01:07:27 It's just, even if they just say, hey guys,
01:07:29 no, don't.
01:07:31 It's one part that...
01:07:33 I'm going to extend this a little farther.
01:07:35 I also hate it when people start off a review
01:07:37 by talking about how they found out about the
01:07:39 show or what their first impressions
01:07:41 of it were.
01:07:43 Unless that story is really interesting.
01:07:45 Unless it's really relevant.
01:07:47 Unless it's really relevant.
01:07:49 Unless it's really relevant.
01:07:51 I do think, and I've made a whole video about
01:07:53 why context matters.
01:07:55 With my lucky star video where I was saying
01:07:57 that a big part of the appeal of this show
01:07:59 for me is watching it with these people
01:08:01 at this time.
01:08:03 But you get so many people who start off their review
01:08:05 like, when this show first started,
01:08:07 I watched the first couple episodes and I thought
01:08:09 I'm not really sure if this is going to be
01:08:11 good or not. I'm not usually into
01:08:13 action shows.
01:08:15 But now that I watched the whole show,
01:08:17 I realized it actually exceeded
01:08:19 my expectations by quite a bit.
01:08:21 And I realized that maybe I should rethink
01:08:23 my, I got, shut up!
01:08:25 Just tell me how the show is!
01:08:27 Jesus Christ!
01:08:29 And if you want to see like,
01:08:31 basically the same list Jesse's
01:08:33 making that I would have is
01:08:35 my Attack on Titan review.
01:08:37 Which was an April Fool's review.
01:08:39 And it's just me doing all of
01:08:41 the worst parts of every anime
01:08:43 review.
01:08:45 I have listened to that one back many times.
01:08:47 It is perfect.
01:08:49 And it starts off with me just like, you know,
01:08:51 when I first saw
01:08:53 Attack on Titan, I thought
01:08:55 my first impressions of it were that at first
01:08:57 it seemed like
01:08:59 the first thing I thought is
01:09:01 going on and on like that.
01:09:03 Alright Jesse, you got another one?
01:09:05 Okay, one more thing to say about derivativeness.
01:09:07 Obviously
01:09:09 everyone is going to emulate the people
01:09:11 they like, especially when they start out.
01:09:13 But a good way to prevent
01:09:15 yourself from feeling derivative
01:09:17 is instead of stealing from one guy
01:09:19 just steal from multiple guys.
01:09:21 And that's how you create a stew
01:09:23 that eventually becomes you.
01:09:25 And I mean, I am all about
01:09:27 copying people.
01:09:29 I'm all about copying people once.
01:09:31 Like I love doing
01:09:33 like I'll find a new reviewer
01:09:35 and I immediately want to do something
01:09:37 in their style and I'll do like a
01:09:39 like I did Your Anime Sucks
01:09:41 which is a send up YMS.
01:09:43 Or you're probably the only guy I've seen
01:09:45 Digi that actually does that
01:09:47 and it's interesting that you're
01:09:49 so interested in just like trying
01:09:51 to do a copy of someone pretty much exactly
01:09:53 but you know, self-awareedly
01:09:55 and intentionally.
01:09:57 I like it because it's a good way to add
01:09:59 new things. Like I see someone
01:10:01 You learn something every time you do something like that.
01:10:03 I see someone with a different tool set from mine
01:10:05 and I'm like I want to learn how to use
01:10:07 those tools. So I try to make a video that's exactly
01:10:09 like them and then
01:10:11 from then on I know how to
01:10:13 like for instance, the asterisk war
01:10:15 sucks. Even though it has
01:10:17 sucks in the title is not supposed to be
01:10:19 in the style of YMS. But there's moments
01:10:21 in it that I use his techniques
01:10:23 where like in Your Anime Sucks
01:10:25 that was like entirely supposed to be this is YMS
01:10:27 but with anime where I went through everything
01:10:29 in order. I made jokes about it.
01:10:31 Does he gain his powers?
01:10:33 Like Mega Man style baby.
01:10:35 Yeah and with asterisk war there's certain
01:10:37 moments where I'll say like
01:10:39 and then she gets hit by lightning
01:10:41 we are three minutes into the episode
01:10:43 and this is all that has happened
01:10:45 and like that's a YMS gag
01:10:47 and I put that in my head
01:10:49 I'm just coming up at the top of my head
01:10:51 but uh
01:10:53 like that's a YMS gag
01:10:55 and I got that from him but like
01:10:57 it's something that can be applied forever
01:10:59 and even like he probably got that from
01:11:01 John Tron from Dai Katana review
01:11:03 where he goes like this is the first
01:11:05 three minutes of the game
01:11:07 it's turtles all the way down everybody's
01:11:09 copying everybody pretty much forever
01:11:11 yeah so uh
01:11:13 I think you should
01:11:15 look at other people and try to like figure out
01:11:17 what they're doing right and copy that
01:11:19 don't cuz it all comes down to
01:11:21 like the surface details
01:11:23 and that uh that what was the
01:11:25 film crit Hulk saying um the tangible
01:11:27 details where people look at it
01:11:29 and they go oh well demo
01:11:31 uses a low voice and it sounds
01:11:33 smooth and he stops his sentences
01:11:35 randomly so I'm gonna do that
01:11:37 demo's got the sexiest
01:11:39 sounding videos
01:11:41 on YouTube they're better than Markiplier
01:11:43 I don't know man I would suck that dudes dick
01:11:45 if he was here in front of me
01:11:47 I love you demo
01:11:49 multiple sources basically is what we're saying
01:11:51 as the song goes
01:11:53 I'm the macho dandy son
01:11:55 of Randy Savage, Captain Kirk
01:11:57 and Travis Touchdown
01:11:59 lots of learn from that folks
01:12:01 the next one I got my own lyrics wrong
01:12:03 yeah macho dandy bastard son
01:12:05 of Captain Kirk
01:12:07 um the next one
01:12:09 is a big do as I say
01:12:11 not as I do
01:12:13 um
01:12:15 alcohol
01:12:17 I'm sick of it
01:12:19 it's the laziest comedy crutch in the history of reviews
01:12:21 the whole oh I
01:12:23 can't even get through this without drinking
01:12:25 gotta knock back some of that
01:12:27 fucking Jim Bean
01:12:29 it's so fucking
01:12:31 laid out and redundant at this point
01:12:33 if you are
01:12:35 drinking alcohol in the video as a joke
01:12:37 fuck you go away and die
01:12:39 you're not the nerd you never will be and you damn sure ain't drowning in horseshoes
01:12:41 so don't even fucking bother
01:12:43 get outta here
01:12:45 I think there's a few ways to like
01:12:47 drinking is a very careful line and I think
01:12:49 if you're good enough to make it work
01:12:51 then you don't need us to tell you
01:12:53 but that's true of pretty much everything
01:12:55 I love doing like cause
01:12:57 I think you should do drinking
01:12:59 is part of your like character
01:13:01 is that you are an alcoholic
01:13:03 if you happen to be a guy
01:13:05 who drinks fine whatever
01:13:07 I'm not gonna tell a grown adult not to drink
01:13:09 but when it's used as like a crutch
01:13:11 for like the whole
01:13:13 I think it's a problem
01:13:15 the first time I watched um
01:13:17 drowning in horseshoes was the first time
01:13:19 I had been like impressed
01:13:21 by like somebody just drinking alcohol
01:13:23 cause like I'd seen the nerd do it
01:13:25 I mean he does it through that horse head too
01:13:27 like the AVGN
01:13:29 just takes a sip and that's just he cuts there
01:13:31 but like just he would like
01:13:33 open the beer
01:13:35 through the horse head
01:13:37 drink the entire thing and then throw it on the ground
01:13:39 and then there's a sound of glass
01:13:41 and the smashing it too is like man selling the joke is great
01:13:43 you gotta do something like that
01:13:45 it just goes to that level
01:13:47 if people do that then I'd be more interested
01:13:49 oh my god is that the origin of the fuck glass
01:13:51 all those broken beer bottles over the years
01:13:53 all the broken, all the continuity
01:13:55 all the shattering beer bottle sounds
01:13:57 that you hear in my videos are legitimate
01:13:59 I go I throw it over
01:14:01 I've always wondered that
01:14:03 but yeah like I think if you can make alcohol
01:14:05 a stunt it can work which Jesse always does
01:14:07 it's always like something impressive
01:14:09 it was invented by the nerd
01:14:11 it was perfected by drowning in horseshoes
01:14:13 and it was taken to a new galaxy
01:14:15 by Colt Corona so no one knows
01:14:17 and if you can make it a good joke
01:14:19 Nate did a great one at the beginning
01:14:21 of growing the gun part one
01:14:23 he opens three beers and does the father
01:14:25 the son and the holy ghost and the drinks
01:14:27 all three at once that was funny
01:14:29 but if it's just like I can't
01:14:31 take this I need to drink
01:14:33 like for me if I was gonna do
01:14:35 cause if I started doing live action segments
01:14:37 not even alcohol just specifically that joke
01:14:39 is the problem I can't take this
01:14:41 if I started doing live
01:14:43 action videos I would drink
01:14:45 in all of them because I love
01:14:47 having myself with a wine glass
01:14:49 because I've kind of become a whino for real
01:14:51 but like uh
01:14:53 I love that boxed wine have you polished that off yet
01:14:55 oh I did last night while we were
01:14:57 having our long ass conversation
01:14:59 congratulations oh this is my third box
01:15:01 it's been one this whole time
01:15:03 anyway um
01:15:05 I like how I complain about this
01:15:07 as I'm drinking whiskey
01:15:09 yeah
01:15:11 but you're not making a big fucking production of it
01:15:13 I think it's great
01:15:15 if the idea is like
01:15:17 I'm like
01:15:19 it's like two different ways some people are like
01:15:21 I have to drink because of this
01:15:23 movie whereas for me I think
01:15:25 it's more I have to this movie
01:15:27 because I drink
01:15:29 I think that's a better way to do it
01:15:31 I'm an alcoholic who's lost my mind
01:15:33 and is trapped in my room watching anime
01:15:35 that's funny you see that's a new
01:15:37 spin on the joke and that's way funnier
01:15:39 yeah definitely that's what I
01:15:41 that's what I want my persona to be
01:15:43 is I mean if you look at all my iconography
01:15:45 on my channel and everything there's always alcohol
01:15:47 so forget this
01:15:49 alcohol is not the problem drink if you want
01:15:51 just write better jokes
01:15:53 yeah okay what's next
01:15:55 the next one is
01:15:57 obnoxious overly long intros
01:15:59 we already did that we already went through that one
01:16:01 don't make a fucking long boring intro
01:16:03 to every video
01:16:05 but there's an addendum to that
01:16:07 specifically heavy metal intros
01:16:09 yeah
01:16:11 unless you're medox
01:16:13 and you're gonna play it through the whole video
01:16:15 everyone loves heavy metal
01:16:17 it's great and we all love it
01:16:19 but something about
01:16:21 putting heavy metal in the intro
01:16:23 as a part of your gimmick just seems so desperate
01:16:25 to me
01:16:27 I have never really watched much of Spoonie's content
01:16:29 I know a lot of you guys are fans but I went back
01:16:31 and watched the beginning of some of his Final Fantasy 8 ones
01:16:33 he's got this really shitty animation
01:16:35 and this like horrible
01:16:37 metal intro that goes on for like
01:16:39 a minute and it was like a nightmare
01:16:41 I could barely sit through it
01:16:43 but like that at the time I'm sure it was like awesome
01:16:45 this was like holy shit he's got an animated intro
01:16:47 this is fucking insane but like now
01:16:49 with the standards we have today it was not good
01:16:51 every metal intro
01:16:53 I don't think he has a metal intro
01:16:55 well it was rock and roll at the very least
01:16:57 every metal intro is always like just a chugging
01:16:59 like basic ass riff
01:17:01 like yeah
01:17:03 what I'm basing this off of is
01:17:05 one of the worst ones that I ever saw
01:17:07 was back in the
01:17:09 that guy with the glasses forum days
01:17:11 and there was this guy called the Hardcore Kid
01:17:15 and his
01:17:17 sounds amazing
01:17:19 he had this long intro
01:17:21 like the entire song
01:17:23 Kickstart My Heart by Motley Crue
01:17:25 and the intro had like explosions
01:17:27 and like he was like slow motion
01:17:29 dude what a badass
01:17:31 like him putting on the leather jacket
01:17:33 putting on the sunglasses
01:17:35 that's another one
01:17:37 did he evolve into Razor Fist later on
01:17:39 he might have lost some weight and became
01:17:41 Razor Fist
01:17:43 I'm just gonna go ahead and set down a fucking rule
01:17:45 when it comes to intro songs
01:17:47 if it's more than 5 seconds long
01:17:49 then here's the rule
01:17:51 it has to be an original song
01:17:53 made by a professional musician
01:17:55 not an original song that you made
01:17:57 or that some guy made
01:17:59 here's the best intros
01:18:01 that are more than 5 seconds long
01:18:03 John Tron's intro is incredible because it's iconic
01:18:05 and the intro is important to the videos
01:18:07 because he uses different versions of the opening
01:18:09 theme throughout the video
01:18:11 to create emotional moments
01:18:13 you'll hear the sad version with something sad happening
01:18:15 it's amazing right?
01:18:17 dude that's why I need to make a fucking intro song
01:18:19 so I can get that emotional pay off later
01:18:21 number 2 guy
01:18:23 we all need intros
01:18:25 number 2 guy
01:18:27 the cinemasticist
01:18:29 he got Perturbator
01:18:31 the guy who does the music for the fucking
01:18:33 hotline miami games
01:18:35 and made him an intro
01:18:37 his videos are about
01:18:39 sleazy 80s action movies
01:18:41 and a guy whose entire career is making games
01:18:43 out of sleazy 80s action movies style
01:18:45 made him a soundtrack
01:18:47 the more I think about this rule
01:18:49 the more I fuck it
01:18:51 and number 3 guy
01:18:53 there's only one guy who's done the metal intro
01:18:55 justifiably
01:18:57 and that's Good Bad Flicks
01:18:59 because the band Psycho Stick made him an intro
01:19:01 and they actually know how to play that style
01:19:03 and here's a rule for intros that I have
01:19:05 especially if your song is loud
01:19:07 and energetic is how it then
01:19:09 fades out like in the middle of a verse
01:19:11 well that's unacceptable
01:19:13 that just completely throws me off
01:19:15 the song should be made for
01:19:17 the song should be
01:19:19 an intro song
01:19:21 it should not be a song that was written for any other purpose
01:19:23 it should just be an actual
01:19:25 intro song that's 20 seconds
01:19:27 like John Tron's song is an intro song
01:19:29 none of these rules should be
01:19:31 taken as set in stone no matter what
01:19:33 there's always exceptions to all of them
01:19:35 the cinematicist has always had great intros
01:19:37 the angry video game nerd
01:19:39 is so iconic and so perfect
01:19:41 it's the greatest intro of all time
01:19:43 even though he hates it
01:19:45 he hates it
01:19:47 which is sad
01:19:49 well I don't know if he hates it but he's gotten very sick of it
01:19:51 well of course
01:19:53 you're doing it for 10 years
01:19:55 whatever
01:19:57 guys if you disagree with any of our rules
01:19:59 prove us wrong
01:20:01 no you don't have to
01:20:03 prove us wrong because they're not set in stone
01:20:05 in any way
01:20:07 just go against the grain
01:20:09 alright Jesse you got any more?
01:20:11 oh I got tons more
01:20:13 oh my god how
01:20:15 we might have split this into two different podcasts
01:20:17 cause I also wanted to talk about
01:20:19 rules that reviewers have about shows
01:20:21 and the longer we go the more we run the risk of technical failures
01:20:23 so we should probably split that up
01:20:25 we're about halfway through my list
01:20:27 is anybody at risk of technical failure?
01:20:29 who knows anyone might lose power
01:20:31 their computer may lock up
01:20:33 I'm not worried about that Jesse continue to do that
01:20:35 alright the next thing on the list
01:20:37 is guys who only do negative reviews
01:20:39 and or shows
01:20:41 based around just cynicism
01:20:43 in general
01:20:45 that's why the mysterious Mr. Enter
01:20:47 is the greatest creator
01:20:49 on YouTube
01:20:51 actually I don't even know if he's
01:20:53 to be fair he does do videos
01:20:55 on good things as well
01:20:57 if the basis of your show
01:20:59 is I'm Mr. Angry Hate Guy
01:21:01 I hate everything and I
01:21:03 I hate everything guy
01:21:05 yeah I mean I actually
01:21:07 haven't watched any of his videos that weren't about the Daddy Derek shit
01:21:09 so I don't know
01:21:11 oh yeah see if I hate everything
01:21:13 don't have an avatar that looks completely hideous
01:21:15 and no one wants to have a look at it
01:21:17 don't have a disgusting repulsive avatar that's a good rule
01:21:19 yeah don't do that
01:21:21 even though he's doing well despite it
01:21:23 it's ironic the best I hate everything
01:21:25 video is the one video that's
01:21:27 I love everything and it's for Star Wars
01:21:29 where he's actually being positive
01:21:31 maybe that's a personal thing I don't know
01:21:33 I just much prefer positive videos
01:21:35 maybe it's a prodigal son sort of thing
01:21:37 where like you get used to him hating everything
01:21:39 and then he finally does a positive and it's like oh yes
01:21:41 I just think that negativity
01:21:43 as a gimmick is played out
01:21:45 I think you should
01:21:47 I think what it does
01:21:49 is like if you're someone like the angry video game nerd
01:21:51 it worked for him because
01:21:53 like it was all these weird games that no one's heard of
01:21:55 and it wasn't really him reviewing
01:21:57 like there was no sense that
01:21:59 you were watching his videos because you needed to hear his opinion
01:22:01 on this game it was about
01:22:03 the game you know
01:22:05 most part his anger was deserved
01:22:07 like it was an actual frustrating experience
01:22:09 right but I think guys like
01:22:11 JonTron and stuff like they do well with that
01:22:13 because JonTron mostly plays
01:22:15 shitty games or watches shitty movies
01:22:17 but it works out because of the fact that
01:22:19 it's about the thing
01:22:21 it's not about the review
01:22:23 it's not about his opinion of it
01:22:25 and if you're an opinion reviewer like I hate everything
01:22:27 then it's like we don't have any metric
01:22:29 for what you actually value
01:22:31 you know like if you only review
01:22:33 bad things
01:22:35 what I love about YMS about your movie sucks
01:22:37 is that he makes so many quickies
01:22:39 where like he reviews every movie
01:22:41 so like
01:22:43 if you were just watching your movie sucks reviews
01:22:45 those are funny and all but like
01:22:47 you really gain context when you see what movies he likes
01:22:49 when you see like
01:22:51 what he gives the 10 out of 10 to
01:22:53 and he makes those top 10 movies of
01:22:55 2014 like those are the
01:22:57 necessary antithesis
01:22:59 to the negative reviews to make you appreciate
01:23:01 what he values
01:23:03 otherwise those reviews would be nothing
01:23:05 he would say like this movie is shit and you'd be like
01:23:07 well I don't know what you like so I don't you know
01:23:09 and now that I do know what you like
01:23:11 then I can take it all with a grain of salt
01:23:13 a good review for negative reviews is
01:23:15 keep in mind just because you dislike something
01:23:17 doesn't necessarily it makes you mad
01:23:19 don't pretend to be mad in your video unless
01:23:21 you actually are mad as a result of the work
01:23:23 there are plenty of things that can be like a 1 out of 10
01:23:25 or a 3 out of 10 that you're just bored of
01:23:27 don't go oh it's terrible
01:23:29 just be like oh I hate it
01:23:31 I think it's pretty clear that the only times
01:23:33 that I've made negative reviews is when there's
01:23:35 like a strong emotion there
01:23:37 it's like this this
01:23:39 show made me really mad
01:23:41 and I have to talk about it
01:23:43 the entire asterisk and even then try to downplay
01:23:45 your anger unless you're funny and you're charismatic
01:23:47 like James Rolfe
01:23:49 you can do whatever be negative about shit
01:23:51 but you know just don't do it all the time
01:23:53 you gotta make it work
01:23:55 if you're mad through the whole video
01:23:57 then it loses impact
01:23:59 in your whole asterisk war series you scream just one time
01:24:01 just once
01:24:03 it's like when I reached the end of my rope
01:24:05 because most of the time I try to be like
01:24:07 sarcastic, snide like oh this is like this
01:24:09 but then there's those moments where it's like
01:24:11 well this is actually a real problem
01:24:13 so now we have to get serious
01:24:15 you know like or this is actually real frustration
01:24:17 so now we have to be frustrated
01:24:19 like understand the emotions of your script
01:24:21 don't flat line the emotion
01:24:23 because then it's just gonna get tiring
01:24:25 and it'd be fair Doug Walker does a
01:24:27 pretty decent job with that he usually creates
01:24:29 like a narrative out of his escalating anger
01:24:31 or conflicting emotions it's just that everyone
01:24:33 imitates him does it wrong which is another rule
01:24:35 try to out do your idols
01:24:37 try to do better than them
01:24:39 you won't succeed
01:24:41 but if you try to think of as your ultimate
01:24:43 pine in the sky dream is to be almost as good
01:24:45 as them you're always gonna be shit
01:24:47 so just make it your goal to be better
01:24:49 that's fair that's good advice
01:24:51 alright Jesse next one
01:24:53 next one adherence to formula
01:24:55 sure yeah
01:24:57 we were kind of talking about that
01:24:59 if you're doing reviews every couple of reviews
01:25:01 change it up don't just be doing
01:25:03 the same shit for fucking five years
01:25:05 yeah all my videos are different
01:25:07 I'm the greatest of all time
01:25:09 unless your formula is so loose
01:25:11 that it like
01:25:13 well in that case you're changing it up intrinsically anyways
01:25:15 like with someone like YMS all the videos
01:25:17 are like you know it's always 20 minute chunks
01:25:19 and we're going through the movie but like
01:25:21 he'll work the context in a different
01:25:23 ways you know it's never like
01:25:25 here's the part right talk about the history
01:25:27 and here's the part right talk about this it's like
01:25:29 it's all each video is its own
01:25:31 unique animal and you know if you have
01:25:33 like a formula that you stick
01:25:35 to real hard then okay
01:25:37 then people are gonna watch you for that
01:25:39 but if you ever change things
01:25:41 you run the risk of them like not giving a shit
01:25:43 about you and then just being like well fuck this
01:25:45 isn't what I signed up for I'm out you know you're not getting
01:25:47 them attached to you as much as
01:25:49 your content everybody go watch
01:25:51 my Super Mario
01:25:53 Brothers 3 review
01:25:55 Sim City review and my Hello Kitty review
01:25:57 3
01:25:59 totally different kinds of videos
01:26:01 and they're all great
01:26:03 well I just want to I just want to make it clear
01:26:05 that like even like even mother's basement
01:26:07 does like even though he'll do like
01:26:09 what's in an OP and every video is just about
01:26:11 an anime opening and it's 10 minutes long
01:26:13 but they're all very
01:26:15 different where he'll cover it like he did
01:26:17 the Dragon Ball Z opening and like most of them
01:26:19 will be like sometimes he'll say like welcome to the
01:26:21 NHK it's like an analysis of like every
01:26:23 image and what it means and how it's relevant
01:26:25 to the story but then he did like DBZ and
01:26:27 it's about the cultural context it's about
01:26:29 what the show did to anime openings
01:26:31 or the one punch man one which is like
01:26:33 literally a game theory video for the one
01:26:35 punch man OP and he's like calculating
01:26:37 how strong the punch is and stuff like
01:26:39 those are all changes to
01:26:41 the formula where it's not every single
01:26:43 video is the same thing even though they are all
01:26:45 about OP's and they're all about the same length
01:26:47 you know but I mean
01:26:49 obviously formulas will meet you with success
01:26:51 depending on what kind so there are
01:26:53 certain types of things where you can always be the same
01:26:55 you know the needle drop always has very similar
01:26:57 elements to every video zero punctuation
01:26:59 always has similar elements every video
01:27:01 these are not rules carefully selected
01:27:03 elements these are not rules that will
01:27:05 make you all these are not rules that will
01:27:07 make people successful video creating
01:27:09 you know what you know what this reminds me
01:27:11 of there's this book that me and Ben read
01:27:13 called how not to write a novel
01:27:15 and all it like no one no one in the world
01:27:17 agrees on how to write a good book but there are
01:27:19 tons of things people agree on to never ever
01:27:21 do if you want your book to sell book one
01:27:23 and like this is I think
01:27:25 I think the thing is like I think
01:27:27 when formula becomes dangerous is when
01:27:29 it's specific like if you do
01:27:31 your videos where you talk about
01:27:33 the story and then talk about the characters
01:27:35 and then talk about this
01:27:37 and you try to apply that to everything
01:27:39 you fail and I hate my anime
01:27:41 list reviews because they encourage that like the
01:27:43 format of the website is that you score
01:27:45 each element and then your overall score
01:27:47 is meant to be like the the the the
01:27:49 summation of those and and I've written
01:27:51 a lot of reviews in this style back in the day
01:27:53 so I know exactly where it's
01:27:55 it's failings are which is that
01:27:57 again you can't apply it to every
01:27:59 show you can sometimes
01:28:01 you can really talk about each
01:28:03 individual thing and and they're all pretty
01:28:05 separate but like if if
01:28:07 if talking about the aesthetics
01:28:09 of the show informs
01:28:11 talking about the characters of the show then
01:28:13 separating them into different sections won't make any
01:28:15 sense you know if part of
01:28:17 if part of my review of the visuals is that
01:28:19 this character looks this way and that informs
01:28:21 their personality in these ways and like I've
01:28:23 already broken formula and fuck it
01:28:25 you know so yeah
01:28:27 Jesse more points
01:28:29 the next point is posturing
01:28:31 and the worst defender
01:28:33 of this one I have to say is
01:28:35 razor fist
01:28:37 the main thing that drives
01:28:39 me crazy about his videos
01:28:41 is that he's never willing to be
01:28:43 the punchline he never laughs
01:28:45 at himself he always
01:28:47 has to be the cool guy making for a guy
01:28:49 that serious that's gonna cause problems
01:28:51 I mean laugh at yourself
01:28:53 again it goes back to like self-awareness
01:28:55 a lot of
01:28:57 most of my jokes most of my
01:28:59 videos are centered around me
01:29:01 being the punchline
01:29:03 you're you know I'm making
01:29:05 I'm making light of the fact that I'm a big
01:29:07 dumb idiot loser and
01:29:09 that's the that
01:29:11 to me is more funny
01:29:13 than trying
01:29:15 to seem like I'm the best guy ever
01:29:17 not not throwing shade
01:29:19 at Nate
01:29:21 but well Nate's videos do the same thing
01:29:23 it comes off as insecure to me
01:29:25 to try to posture
01:29:27 like you're the best guy
01:29:29 Nate's videos always the idea
01:29:31 of it is that it's all
01:29:33 fake posturing that like
01:29:35 at some point he pulls back the curtain
01:29:37 and it's actually some nerd
01:29:39 you know where like the idea
01:29:41 the girl in the gone video is like I used to be
01:29:43 this weak piece of shit and then I watched
01:29:45 the show and it made me the best guy ever
01:29:47 and like that's sort of the joke
01:29:49 I connect way more way easier
01:29:51 with people who
01:29:53 show that they can laugh at themselves
01:29:55 Nate are you still there you didn't have
01:29:57 any reaction to us talking about you
01:29:59 he's dead I killed him
01:30:01 oh no
01:30:03 you didn't have enough self-awareness
01:30:05 alright Jesse
01:30:07 next point
01:30:09 over reliance on memes
01:30:11 memes are a tool
01:30:13 they can be hilarious use them sparingly
01:30:15 alright do you mean
01:30:17 memes as in memes from other things
01:30:19 or like just you know
01:30:21 memes or is it okay to keep
01:30:23 your own meme like create your own meme
01:30:25 oh man creating your own memes is awesome everyone should
01:30:27 cause I love those
01:30:29 well if you watched all the nostalgia critic
01:30:31 you would understand how those can be abuse
01:30:33 okay well never mind don't do that either don't do anything
01:30:35 yeah uh yeah
01:30:37 don't use too many memes or too many references
01:30:39 yeah a well placed
01:30:41 reference can be the funniest fucking joke
01:30:43 ever but if your script has them
01:30:45 oh yeah I think
01:30:47 they're like a
01:30:49 like a very special silver bullet
01:30:51 like if you can put just the right
01:30:53 reference at the right moment it can blow
01:30:55 everything wider
01:30:57 a lot of things that people
01:30:59 I want you to talk about whenever you want to
01:31:01 talk you should
01:31:03 um what was I saying
01:31:05 something about references yeah
01:31:07 a lot of the time
01:31:09 I see people making references as
01:31:11 jokes in and of themselves
01:31:13 just like uh like I'm drawing attention
01:31:15 to the fact that I know about this thing
01:31:17 and that's the biggest one that comes to mind
01:31:19 is I Love Can Possible
01:31:21 yeah yeah you know
01:31:23 like it's just it's
01:31:25 meaningless but it does oh man
01:31:27 it does get the views it gets the kids all happy
01:31:29 they're like oh you know my thing
01:31:31 of all of these rules that we've been
01:31:33 like where Jesse was saying these won't necessarily
01:31:35 make you a famous youtuber they'll make you a good one
01:31:37 this is the number one rule to break
01:31:39 if you just want free hits
01:31:41 yeah make references to everything
01:31:43 load your video with memes
01:31:45 and all the fucking
01:31:47 put sans and papyrus in the thumbnail
01:31:49 of every fucking video
01:31:51 regardless of whether you're talking about it
01:31:53 just any good measure
01:31:55 anything that's popular or noteworthy
01:31:57 sans papyrus and shrek
01:31:59 throw it in there and then
01:32:01 and some illuminati triangles in there
01:32:03 the reason it works is because for some reason
01:32:05 people don't understand
01:32:07 internet is a place where everything you like
01:32:09 a thousand other people
01:32:11 like as well for some reason everyone
01:32:13 thinks that if you make a reference to something
01:32:15 and they get that reference it's like a special
01:32:17 connection like oh my god
01:32:19 you referenced a meme I've heard of and it's like
01:32:21 yeah everyone's heard of it
01:32:23 that's why I like to think and I take pride
01:32:25 in the fact that many of my references
01:32:27 are so obscure
01:32:29 that only three people will get them
01:32:31 yeah well the only thing about good references
01:32:33 is like a good reference
01:32:35 can make sense even if you have no idea
01:32:37 what it means or what it means in context
01:32:39 it just is a thing that you said
01:32:41 and it's cool
01:32:43 there's one other rule about doing references
01:32:45 that when I explain it
01:32:47 it seems so obvious but the nostalgia critic himself
01:32:49 continues to break it at least
01:32:51 a couple years ago back when I was still watching him
01:32:53 in general
01:32:55 don't set don't
01:32:57 this is what a lot of nostalgia critic does
01:32:59 he will show a clip and be like wow
01:33:01 that's just like such and such
01:33:03 and then show such and such
01:33:05 you're not even doing the structure
01:33:07 of referencing something correctly
01:33:09 if you explain it first
01:33:11 just throw that out there
01:33:13 while we're on the subject of references
01:33:15 this is just a flash forward
01:33:17 to what the future of this conversation will be
01:33:19 I'm in a nightmare it's still going
01:33:21 one of the rules that a lot of people apply
01:33:23 towards the things that they review
01:33:25 is that reference comedy
01:33:27 is somehow the lowest form of comedy
01:33:29 did anyone else get cut off
01:33:31 you said
01:33:33 what am I here
01:33:35 your hand if you would please
01:33:37 okay what I was going to say
01:33:39 is for some reason people think
01:33:41 that reference comedy is the lowest form
01:33:43 of comedy and they never explain
01:33:45 why it's just
01:33:47 something people seem to think right
01:33:49 and I think that like Lucky Star
01:33:51 proves that that's not true
01:33:53 and there's a great scene where
01:33:55 it's an initial D reference
01:33:57 suddenly the animation style
01:33:59 comes initial D and the characters start racing down the road
01:34:01 if you have no idea what it's referencing
01:34:03 it's still hilarious
01:34:05 because for some reason the animation style
01:34:07 completely changes
01:34:09 they went in on that joke so hard that you're going to appreciate
01:34:11 no matter what it's not like they just cut to an initial D clip
01:34:13 and it was like isn't it funny we're doing
01:34:15 something sort of similar to that right now
01:34:17 if you've never seen initial D you'll still be like
01:34:19 what the fuck is happening
01:34:21 the animation style is totally different
01:34:23 the music is totally different this is hilarious
01:34:25 but if you have seen initial D then you're like
01:34:27 oh multi trap drifting
01:34:29 holy shit
01:34:31 I think references
01:34:33 not only can they work on multiple levels
01:34:35 but also for the people who do get
01:34:37 the reference it can be fucking hilarious
01:34:39 people are always like
01:34:41 oh references the lowest form of comedy because it relies on
01:34:43 another work and not everyone gets it
01:34:45 and it's like yeah but if you do get it
01:34:47 guess what here's what's good comedy
01:34:49 if it makes you laugh
01:34:51 it's good comedy
01:34:53 if it doesn't
01:34:55 a reference has the ability to make people laugh
01:34:57 for like totally different reasons
01:34:59 so if you do it well that's pretty cool
01:35:01 the worst thing
01:35:03 about every review of comedy
01:35:05 is for some reason everyone thinks
01:35:07 that comedy has all these
01:35:09 really strict rules and every time someone
01:35:11 does a comedy review they're like
01:35:13 comedy is the hardest thing to get right
01:35:15 we all saw that king of the hill episode
01:35:17 where bobby goes to school to try to
01:35:19 learn how to do comedy by the book
01:35:21 and it doesn't work out folks
01:35:23 nobody laughs everyone thinks
01:35:25 every fucking video
01:35:27 where someone reviews a comedy they always have to have
01:35:29 this long speech about how comedy
01:35:31 is so different from drama and you have to judge it on
01:35:33 a different scale and this is the right kind of humor
01:35:35 this is the wrong if it makes you laugh
01:35:37 it's funny
01:35:39 and it's good comedy there's a million
01:35:41 ways that you can accomplish that
01:35:43 but trying to be like
01:35:45 oh well this kind of comedy
01:35:47 is never funny except
01:35:49 it is all the time references
01:35:51 are often funny
01:35:53 the easiest one to fuck up
01:35:55 but they are very often hilarious
01:35:57 family guys' references are funny
01:35:59 they animate ridiculous shit
01:36:01 the hardest I've laughed so far this year
01:36:03 was jesse's
01:36:05 in a analysis video
01:36:07 or review jesse did the video
01:36:09 about the christmas specials
01:36:11 and he has this long lead up
01:36:13 I won't even spoil the line
01:36:15 but it's too
01:36:17 you'll know it if you see it
01:36:19 what was this involving I don't remember the
01:36:21 alright fine he was telling this whole story
01:36:23 about Helga in the christmas special
01:36:25 of hey Arnold and the whole thing
01:36:27 is she's trying to get these shoes
01:36:29 and then like she has this whole moral
01:36:31 conundrum about whether she should give the shoes
01:36:33 to this other person or keep them for herself
01:36:35 and like jesse
01:36:37 frames this whole thing and then he says
01:36:39 she is truly drowning
01:36:41 in footwear and like
01:36:43 the way it all led up to it was so perfect
01:36:45 I was very proud of that one
01:36:47 a well constructed
01:36:49 bit in a well constructed video
01:36:51 and it's a reference and if people haven't been around
01:36:53 on your channel long enough to know what drowning
01:36:55 in footwear is then they won't get it
01:36:57 but like it's not intrusive
01:36:59 it's just something
01:37:01 that you'll get more if you know the reference
01:37:03 and it's fucking hilarious
01:37:05 and even if you don't get the reference
01:37:07 I added in that few seconds of like wind howling
01:37:09 and like the air enhancing
01:37:11 like that's not fucking funny
01:37:13 even if you don't get it then that's also part of the joke
01:37:15 that's how
01:37:17 that's what it means to be a comedy genius
01:37:19 people
01:37:21 you gotta bang on all cylinders
01:37:23 somebody mentioned kim possible
01:37:25 which made me add a new one right on the fly here
01:37:27 which is having editors
01:37:29 edit your own shit god damn it
01:37:31 have some pride in your fucking art
01:37:33 and edit your god damn
01:37:35 own videos
01:37:37 there is
01:37:39 except for me
01:37:41 that's the thing though
01:37:43 kim it's like
01:37:45 when we talk about i love kim possible a lot
01:37:47 you can't judge like her content
01:37:49 as if it's like her just making it
01:37:51 you can't say like wow kim makes great videos
01:37:53 you have to say like her videos on her channel
01:37:55 are clearly the work of a lot of people
01:37:57 putting in time to make a video
01:37:59 here's what it comes down to for me
01:38:01 I hate editing more than anything
01:38:03 in the god damn world
01:38:05 but the reason I do it is because
01:38:07 I have so much pride
01:38:09 and vision in my work
01:38:11 I can't do it
01:38:13 I can't trust it
01:38:15 there's been times I said devu edit a video for me
01:38:17 and he's like okay and I'm like no wait never mind
01:38:19 I'm doing it myself fuck it fuck it
01:38:21 and then the video never come out
01:38:23 I can't even finish it
01:38:25 it's just a matter of I don't think the rule should be
01:38:27 don't have editors it should be have editors
01:38:29 who you're working closely with
01:38:31 and who are communicating the same thing you are
01:38:33 and play what you try to do
01:38:35 I don't think I could possibly ever make a video
01:38:37 and have someone else edit it
01:38:39 somebody who wants and gags that come
01:38:41 from the editing process
01:38:43 that you think of during that
01:38:45 but at the same time sometimes you're
01:38:47 to me it's not a matter of
01:38:49 like I'm handing off my
01:38:51 my thing to someone else and they're doing something
01:38:53 it's more like I mean if you're a musician
01:38:55 and you're in a band and you don't play all the
01:38:57 instruments then that means
01:38:59 that every song is the collaborative effort
01:39:01 of you and three other people
01:39:03 and like with my videos
01:39:05 cause I hate editing
01:39:07 and I will just
01:39:09 not make the video as good as it should be
01:39:11 because I don't want to edit it
01:39:13 I just won't do it like if there's something
01:39:15 that I know that if I spent
01:39:17 40 hours on it it could be fine
01:39:19 but like there's no way I'm going to spend 40
01:39:21 hours on it then you know
01:39:23 I won't write my videos in a way that requires that
01:39:25 but I know that the DeVu
01:39:27 can take like he finds
01:39:29 the jokes that I don't even
01:39:31 take the time to look for you know
01:39:33 cause he'll see the show so many times
01:39:35 he'll edit the video in such a way where he'll make
01:39:37 the characters make certain facial expressions
01:39:39 when I say something that always is hilarious
01:39:41 and it's something I would never have looked out for
01:39:43 I would never have found so like
01:39:45 I think taking
01:39:47 editors is fine if they are
01:39:49 better than you and they
01:39:51 are like
01:39:53 they understand your vision
01:39:55 like just as well as you do
01:39:57 and can or if you just like
01:39:59 I like DeVu's videos that
01:40:01 he edits for me more than I like
01:40:03 videos that I edit for me so like
01:40:05 I would rather he edits them
01:40:07 I have an editor if it's clear that you're using it
01:40:09 to make your content better or bigger
01:40:11 or more voluminous like you know
01:40:13 I guess it's impossible it just feels lazy but
01:40:15 I think you guys are trying too hard to justify
01:40:17 using an editor you can use an editor for whatever
01:40:19 you want to be anytime
01:40:21 I mean it's just about what you want your
01:40:23 shit to be if you just want to have people
01:40:25 make your shit for you and you just want to produce
01:40:27 collaborative works that's fine I completely
01:40:29 understand Jesse not wanting other people to edit
01:40:31 his videos because the editing is often
01:40:33 hilarious and has great stuff in it but like
01:40:35 if you're like me and you
01:40:37 are just not good at editing
01:40:39 then maybe consider having someone
01:40:41 who is good you know doing it with
01:40:43 you know I mean I think most of us
01:40:45 agree that I'm one of the better editor amongst us
01:40:47 and even I'm willing to say
01:40:49 that I don't if I I don't think
01:40:51 it's necessary to I don't even think
01:40:53 I was gonna say like you do you don't
01:40:55 have to have the best video
01:40:57 it could possibly be all the time
01:40:59 like I don't yeah I definitely have been
01:41:01 moving away from putting too much effort in this
01:41:03 like especially on YouTube we're incentivized
01:41:05 to make fast content here we go
01:41:07 Jesse how about this how about this
01:41:09 for the rule earn your
01:41:11 editor how about that
01:41:13 sure or at least pay them
01:41:15 well you gotta pay your
01:41:17 if you're making money well yeah if you're making money
01:41:19 you should be paying them but what I mean by earn them is
01:41:21 I don't think KP does any work
01:41:23 on her videos I think the editors do all the work
01:41:25 that's true that's what I think
01:41:27 specifically watching a video going well at least
01:41:29 this is well animated what I what I hate
01:41:31 is like how I hate how
01:41:33 popular she personally
01:41:35 seems to be for her videos that clearly
01:41:37 aren't her she didn't do it she wrote
01:41:39 the script and read it fucking
01:41:41 not very well let's let's be honest
01:41:43 alright Jesse do your next point
01:41:45 let's move on fuck I had
01:41:47 something else to say but I can't even
01:41:49 someone's gotta edit this
01:41:51 we gotta cut cut that out I don't want to
01:41:53 nobody here listen to what I said
01:41:55 ignore that the next
01:41:57 one is things that everyone
01:41:59 has already fucking reviewed redundancy
01:42:01 don't write it
01:42:03 that's just don't do it
01:42:05 and the next like four points are
01:42:07 all actually redundant in themselves
01:42:09 I'm gonna go shit he's a hypocrite
01:42:11 yeah I'm
01:42:13 grouping these together blank is
01:42:15 overrated reviews
01:42:17 controversial opinion reviews
01:42:19 audience straw man
01:42:21 bullshit just in general
01:42:23 basing your review on other people's
01:42:25 opinions don't do it
01:42:27 it's not just an escape
01:42:29 you're a fucking review should be
01:42:31 your thoughts and no one else's
01:42:33 I actually had a video
01:42:35 that was gonna come out about this same subject
01:42:37 but I got to the editing process
01:42:39 and I didn't feel like doing it and I refuse
01:42:41 to hire either I realize
01:42:43 another another one that I want people to do
01:42:45 which is um
01:42:47 no shit I lost track of it oh yeah
01:42:49 don't do this thing where
01:42:51 you're afraid of having your opinion
01:42:53 polluted by watching other people's reviews
01:42:55 oh yeah watch everyone else's reviews
01:42:57 right because if you do like people always
01:42:59 say like oh well I I guess I get it
01:43:01 for like a guy like Yahtzee where
01:43:03 again like it's really about his like
01:43:05 very carefully curated
01:43:07 style of opinion then like
01:43:09 if if you're watching the video
01:43:11 because you want to hear that guy's
01:43:13 thoughts and like nothing but that
01:43:15 then I could see it but like
01:43:17 if it's if someone
01:43:19 puts out a review
01:43:21 five years late for a show
01:43:23 or even five months late for a show
01:43:25 five weeks if everyone else
01:43:27 has already reviewed it watch all of their reviews
01:43:29 and make sure that someone hasn't said what you're about to say
01:43:31 right or else you're just wasting everyone's
01:43:33 time especially your own like have something
01:43:35 new to say don't just say the same thing everybody else
01:43:37 and you know what it's I'm glad we brought this up because
01:43:39 this was a big reason why I was inspired
01:43:41 to make my Gernlogan video because
01:43:43 every single video I ever saw
01:43:45 has these disgusting little
01:43:47 like oh you know it's it's
01:43:49 it's good but like there's all this
01:43:51 there's all this obviously unnecessary shit
01:43:53 there's all these little like it's not that smart
01:43:55 and all the the ironic thing is
01:43:57 these people weren't that smart because they couldn't see the
01:43:59 incredibly obvious shit that all of us
01:44:01 did when we watched it and so
01:44:03 I this was this was an example of having
01:44:05 to do something like this show is is loved
01:44:07 but still vastly underrated
01:44:09 for what it actually accomplishes
01:44:11 which is bizarre to me and had to be corrected
01:44:13 so that's exactly why I started doing
01:44:15 my like with Eva and Gelyon
01:44:17 like I was so worried for a long time that
01:44:19 I was like everyone's already talked about Eva
01:44:21 and it's not going to be worth it unless I either
01:44:23 say absolutely everything or say
01:44:25 something new and then it was sort of like
01:44:27 gradually realizing
01:44:29 that there was a lot less Eva analysis
01:44:31 out there than I thought you know
01:44:33 and like trying to come at it from like somewhat new
01:44:35 angles or just sometimes it's just like
01:44:37 representing something that's not in that medium
01:44:39 like I'm willing to do a video on a
01:44:41 subject that I've read a lot of
01:44:43 reviews about but no one's made a video
01:44:45 out of it because I think that people
01:44:47 don't go back and don't read text
01:44:49 you know sure yeah like there's a few like
01:44:51 ghost lightning posts that I outright just want to
01:44:53 adapt into video because like
01:44:55 it'll exist in this medium now
01:44:57 I think that's a good idea they'll probably
01:44:59 get a lot more exposure that way anyway
01:45:01 alright so Jesse you finished off your list right
01:45:03 no oh jeez how many more
01:45:05 my list is eternal it's endless
01:45:07 like me
01:45:09 alright well let's do the next one
01:45:11 next one is
01:45:13 blatantly missing the point of what you're talking
01:45:15 about example
01:45:17 sure sure example is
01:45:19 Avon Gillian sucks because the characters are
01:45:21 unlikable fuck you
01:45:23 you dumb shit yeah I mean
01:45:25 I don't like reviews that are obviously wrong
01:45:27 not a fan like you could say
01:45:29 the characters are unlikable dot dot dot I know
01:45:31 that's the the intention but I don't like
01:45:33 it then that's fine
01:45:35 well I have a problem in general of people saying
01:45:37 this character is bad
01:45:39 so the show is bad
01:45:41 well that's going to get us into part two
01:45:43 of this podcast so
01:45:45 part two people having
01:45:47 my list god damn it
01:45:49 no your list is going to apply to this as well
01:45:51 I think okay part two of this podcast
01:45:53 people's rules
01:45:55 about shows
01:45:57 like that one that like
01:45:59 here's here's the one that bothers me the most
01:46:01 and this is what made me want to do this
01:46:03 podcast in the first place
01:46:05 my trigger is when someone
01:46:07 says that the pacing
01:46:09 is bad and then
01:46:11 doesn't explain why
01:46:13 that is my number one trigger now
01:46:15 in an analytical video
01:46:17 is because people have
01:46:19 taken for granted that
01:46:21 a piece of work is supposed to
01:46:23 be certain things that it's
01:46:25 supposed to be paced a certain
01:46:27 way that it's supposed to present its
01:46:29 narrative in a certain way the characters
01:46:31 supposed to be a certain way and the only times people
01:46:33 break from their their pre-interpreted
01:46:35 formula of what it's supposed to be
01:46:37 is when it's obviously
01:46:39 not supposed to be that right sure because
01:46:41 everyone loves art house movies and stuff
01:46:43 where like you look at it and you go oh
01:46:45 well they obviously paste it differently because
01:46:47 it's it's sending a message but then
01:46:49 when that's not obvious people are
01:46:51 like it's just badly paced you know
01:46:53 yeah and that drives me insane
01:46:55 because it's like you're so close to getting it
01:46:57 and not like you clearly understand
01:46:59 that every work is trying
01:47:01 to do something different and that you should judge
01:47:03 them on their own merits but then you're trying
01:47:05 to put all of them into a box at the same
01:47:07 time and it's like certain things are just
01:47:09 the exception because you can tell its art
01:47:11 you know like oh well obviously
01:47:13 Ava's trying to do something different
01:47:15 because it's Ava whereas like
01:47:17 if some you know late night
01:47:19 TV at a bay that's like really weird
01:47:21 and no one gets why
01:47:23 and they're just like yeah it's just
01:47:25 I should just I should rephrase
01:47:27 the wording of this rule
01:47:29 instead of missing the point of what you're talking
01:47:31 about the rule should be
01:47:33 saying anything negative
01:47:35 about Evangelion ever for any reason
01:47:37 or disagreeing with me
01:47:39 about anything
01:47:41 you know that's an important point
01:47:43 to remember when interpreting
01:47:45 the intentionality of a work is that
01:47:47 most almost any every single
01:47:49 detail was intentional whether or not
01:47:51 the intention was smart oh god
01:47:53 there you go there's another huge one
01:47:55 this is another one that like immediately
01:47:57 pisses me off is when reviewers
01:47:59 think that they are smarter
01:48:01 than the creator
01:48:03 that's what I was trying to say
01:48:05 what said stupidly
01:48:07 the worst game designer
01:48:09 is categorically a more
01:48:11 fulfilling artist than the best reviewer
01:48:13 that's my emotional opinion
01:48:15 that's my emotional opinion
01:48:17 that's how I feel
01:48:19 I think that a lot of bad
01:48:21 art gets made in full
01:48:23 self-awareness
01:48:25 I think that a lot of stuff
01:48:27 there are some cases where obviously
01:48:29 the person just doesn't know what the fuck they're doing
01:48:31 like if you look at like Birdemic or The Room
01:48:33 where like the creators really thought they were
01:48:35 making like a masterpiece and really came out
01:48:37 and said that and then people were like
01:48:39 you're insane like this is no
01:48:41 this is not good you know right that's a different story
01:48:43 there's obviously a reason why he picked
01:48:45 the individual gifts for the birds
01:48:47 like he's like well this one is pointing in this direction
01:48:49 which will make more sense than that direction
01:48:51 yeah but I mean I'm talking about like in the broad
01:48:53 sense you can tell the guy
01:48:55 doesn't appreciate what's bad
01:48:57 about his movie until people told him
01:48:59 you know but I think that a lot
01:49:01 of creators make stuff
01:49:03 like especially professionals like if we're talking about
01:49:05 like an anime show gets made right and like
01:49:07 the plot is full of plot holes
01:49:09 the guys who wrote it probably
01:49:11 know that like they are professional
01:49:13 writers who are in the industry
01:49:15 they're not trying to write a 10 out of 10
01:49:17 every time they're trying to write something
01:49:19 and like you know okay like I have
01:49:21 this video series on the Astroscore right and there's
01:49:23 a bunch of parts in there where I talk about how
01:49:25 like I like my problems with A1 Studio
01:49:27 but my problem is never that
01:49:29 I think they're ignorant of these issues
01:49:31 I think they know exactly
01:49:33 what they're making and they just
01:49:35 they have to because it's
01:49:37 it's just their job you know like
01:49:39 they're doing it and if you look at
01:49:41 like if you listen to a lot of interviews
01:49:43 with like Japanese creatives and stuff
01:49:45 they very often make it clear
01:49:47 that like everything was intentional
01:49:49 like the style of story
01:49:51 like Japan is very like demographically
01:49:53 driven and very like
01:49:55 genre driven where like
01:49:57 if they're making a show about beautiful girls
01:49:59 it's a beautiful girls show
01:50:01 you know like they'll call it that
01:50:03 like that's the concept they went at it with was
01:50:05 oh we wanted to make a beautiful girls show
01:50:07 so we came up with a story and here's what it is
01:50:09 you know and like everything else
01:50:11 is kind of incidental to the fact that it's a beautiful girls show
01:50:13 you can make a great
01:50:15 show on that basis like
01:50:17 something like Girl in the Gone they went at it like
01:50:19 a sex show or
01:50:21 or Ereka 7 which was we wanted to make a video game
01:50:23 that had an anime tie in
01:50:25 and here's what we made you know
01:50:27 wait did they do that
01:50:29 yeah a lot of anime
01:50:31 is based on it being a franchise
01:50:33 where like they
01:50:35 like with Ereka 7 it was like
01:50:37 we want to make a video game and an anime
01:50:39 with this robot designer so let's come up with them
01:50:41 you know I didn't actually play the first
01:50:43 video game of that I didn't know it was like
01:50:45 I thought it was just a derivative work afterward
01:50:47 no but it's the thing is that like
01:50:49 it's different teams working on each right
01:50:51 and like the people who made the game
01:50:53 didn't make an amazing
01:50:55 game that will remember for all time
01:50:57 but the people who made the anime did you know
01:50:59 but like it just happens that
01:51:01 like I think everyone knew what they were doing
01:51:03 everyone works on these things just like well
01:51:05 maybe it'll be good and then they make something
01:51:07 and sometimes it just happens to come out really amazing
01:51:09 and they're like sweet and we actually did it
01:51:11 and here's how you put it in one of your old videos
01:51:13 one of the best points in your really old
01:51:15 videos was nothing is made
01:51:17 thoughtlessly it's just that some things
01:51:19 are made with stupid thoughts
01:51:21 but it wasn't like they didn't even think
01:51:23 I mean every single problem
01:51:25 in My Little Pony for instance
01:51:27 has been acknowledged by the writers they
01:51:29 they're completely aware they're like
01:51:31 yeah we had to do that because Hasbro
01:51:33 mandated it or yeah we had to do that
01:51:35 because we didn't have time
01:51:37 to fix it you know like
01:51:39 like the episode 15 of season 1
01:51:41 of Feeling Pinky Keen
01:51:43 the one where she's got the powers
01:51:45 like the writer of that
01:51:47 like he had written
01:51:49 the episode no it wasn't that episode
01:51:51 it was one that's in season 3
01:51:53 or an even better example magical mystery cure
01:51:55 where Emmy Larson came out and admitted that
01:51:57 everything I said was correct
01:51:59 right yeah you wanted to be two episodes
01:52:01 you just couldn't fit in it
01:52:03 he specifically said drowning in horseshoes
01:52:05 the greatest reviewer in history
01:52:07 but I'm not just talking about like studio mandates
01:52:09 there was one where it was the guy who wrote
01:52:11 this one episode that was
01:52:13 something from season 3 but it was a really shitty episode
01:52:15 where the ending was like really confusing
01:52:17 and backwards and I asked the writer
01:52:19 on Twitter like what was up with the
01:52:21 ending and he said like it was just a mix-up
01:52:23 in the scripting and we couldn't fix it in time
01:52:25 I wonder if you could
01:52:27 evaluate all the reviewers and get
01:52:29 like a robot to calculate which
01:52:31 reviewers most often neglect
01:52:33 the context of the fact that the writers are human
01:52:35 oh here we go
01:52:37 mysterious Mr. Enter that's my biggest problem
01:52:39 and then test to see
01:52:41 if those reviewers who are more
01:52:43 likely to do it don't make any art
01:52:45 of their own outside of these youtube videos
01:52:47 like if they're not the kind of kids who made
01:52:49 you know drawings that much
01:52:51 I wonder if that's what they are
01:52:53 about the few mysterious Mr. Enter videos that I've seen
01:52:55 is that he will
01:52:57 he really focuses on the writer and he'll be like
01:52:59 Megan McCarthy
01:53:01 how could you make this shitty episode
01:53:03 and I'm like I am absolutely
01:53:05 sure that she knows all the problems with it
01:53:07 she wrote it no one is
01:53:09 more intimately familiar with their flaws
01:53:11 than the creator and we all
01:53:13 I think we can all attest to this right every flaw
01:53:15 in all of our videos we know what it is
01:53:17 like I know many problems
01:53:19 that people don't interpret as problems we do
01:53:21 see them as problems
01:53:23 every video I've ever made there's a take to heart
01:53:25 we know better than you what the
01:53:27 fuck is wrong with her every single time
01:53:29 I flub a word in my script I find
01:53:31 it because I edit the video
01:53:33 so like you know I record this long script
01:53:35 and I edit it together and then I hear
01:53:37 where like I skipped a word at one part
01:53:39 and I'm like oh fuck and then every time I watch the video
01:53:41 all I can think about is that
01:53:43 sometimes we just don't get
01:53:45 around to fixing the problems and I think a lot
01:53:47 of like really professional
01:53:49 stuff it comes from that place
01:53:51 like with anime especially because it's all churned out
01:53:53 on like a schedule you can't just go back and fix it
01:53:55 you have investors there's people
01:53:57 a time slot picked out you know
01:53:59 if you get to episode 12 and you're
01:54:01 writing and you don't have time to fix the
01:54:03 slot hole then it's just fuck it we're shipping it
01:54:05 like we can't not you know it's
01:54:07 it's too far along and I think
01:54:09 so few people appreciate that and they act
01:54:11 like oh this writer is such
01:54:13 an idiot how could you do this thing it's like
01:54:15 I assure you they're aware of it
01:54:17 that's true that's true you shouldn't assume
01:54:19 those things but you should still of course
01:54:21 incorporate those into your thoughts
01:54:23 on the overall show
01:54:25 he's felt bad about a lot
01:54:27 of his old reviews and is like taking them down
01:54:29 I think because it's good he should take down
01:54:31 his whole channel fuck him
01:54:33 I think as I've said
01:54:35 oh shit
01:54:37 I lost my train of thought because you brought up
01:54:39 Mr. Enter and I forgot what I was going to say
01:54:41 this is what Mr. Enter does to the community
01:54:43 well speaking of Mr. Enter
01:54:45 the next item on my list happens to be
01:54:47 overly complex
01:54:49 scoring systems
01:54:51 get the fuck out of here with your
01:54:53 well it gets a 3 out of 5
01:54:55 sound design and a 2 out of 5
01:54:57 for voice acting a 4 out of
01:54:59 5 for graphics
01:55:01 I don't know what piece of media
01:55:03 has those criteria
01:55:05 yeah
01:55:07 fuck that just talk about the thing
01:55:09 and uh
01:55:11 here's what bothers me about rating systems
01:55:13 is that they should always be fluid
01:55:15 and therefore they should never be in a video
01:55:17 like if I watch a show
01:55:19 that's a 10 out of 10
01:55:21 and then a month later I watch a show
01:55:23 that I consider to be much better
01:55:25 and that's now my 10 out of 10
01:55:27 the old score is completely irrelevant
01:55:29 I'll put it this way
01:55:31 if I
01:55:33 if I have sex with a hot girl
01:55:35 and I'm bragging all my friends about it
01:55:37 which happens often
01:55:39 as these guys get a test too
01:55:41 oh yeah
01:55:43 but if I had sex
01:55:45 well that's what I'm about to do
01:55:47 if I have sex with a hot girl
01:55:49 and I'm bragging about it
01:55:51 like a douchebag as I am
01:55:53 I don't go
01:55:55 5 out of 10 but her butt
01:55:57 wasn't 6 out of 10
01:55:59 and then
01:56:01 I give her one numerical value
01:56:03 and only one for the whole package
01:56:05 because people are not a bunch of separate
01:56:07 compartmentalized things
01:56:09 people are wonderful beautiful creatures
01:56:11 even when they're like a 6 out of 10
01:56:13 you gotta
01:56:15 but her pussy game man
01:56:17 10 out of 10 on that shit
01:56:19 here's what I think that
01:56:21 every scoring system falls apart when you try to do it that way
01:56:23 cause at some point
01:56:25 on my anime
01:56:27 list one of the scores that
01:56:29 it's like sound, video, character story
01:56:31 and then enjoyment
01:56:33 and enjoyment
01:56:35 is such a weird thing
01:56:37 because like overall
01:56:39 the music but overall enjoyment was pretty shit
01:56:41 but here's the thing
01:56:43 to me enjoyment really means context
01:56:45 and like here's the thing
01:56:47 if I watch a show like let's say Lucky Star again
01:56:49 and the context is super important to why I like the show
01:56:51 and then another show
01:56:53 that I still think is amazing but there's like
01:56:55 no context into why
01:56:57 what if I watch a show with all my best friends
01:56:59 and I give it a 10 out of 10
01:57:01 versus someone else who watched a show like alone
01:57:03 and they had just been shot and they're currently bleeding out
01:57:05 like okay my German was a 0
01:57:07 didn't like the show
01:57:09 I think that's another one of those cases
01:57:11 of like being so close to getting it
01:57:13 but not quite where it's like
01:57:15 you get that there's an ephemeral
01:57:17 factor to why you like stuff
01:57:19 and you try to then define that
01:57:21 and it's like those scores
01:57:23 mean nothing
01:57:25 like the context
01:57:27 should not have a score
01:57:29 it should just be a part of why you like the thing
01:57:31 you know like the context is inseparable
01:57:33 from the work but like
01:57:35 I don't think like if I
01:57:37 if I watched like Kaiba
01:57:39 and it didn't have any special
01:57:41 additional context score
01:57:43 so that's just a 0
01:57:45 and then Lucky Star it's a 10
01:57:47 against the other like am I supposed to go
01:57:49 story 9 characters 9
01:57:51 art 9 sound 9
01:57:53 context 0 and then take the
01:57:55 average of that and it completely
01:57:57 fucks up the score it's like no
01:57:59 it's indefinable
01:58:01 getting towards something about
01:58:03 just the general consumption of media
01:58:05 and sorting your feelings on it
01:58:07 that has been like one of the best things
01:58:09 that you've indirectly taught me is
01:58:11 do not hold on to your opinions
01:58:13 don't hold them as precious
01:58:15 don't flip at the drop of a hat
01:58:17 because it's way way more
01:58:19 oh man that's also another
01:58:21 once someone especially
01:58:23 an amateur reviewer give something a 10
01:58:25 they feel an obligation
01:58:27 I used to feel an obligation
01:58:29 to make sure that I always
01:58:31 continue to like it and if there was any doubt
01:58:33 I would start rationalizing to myself
01:58:35 no it has to still be a 10
01:58:37 it has to be nothing is worse to me
01:58:39 than when someone has
01:58:41 a narrative opinion
01:58:43 that has clearly
01:58:45 been like too long
01:58:47 in the works like when you like you said
01:58:49 like they have their favorite anime
01:58:51 that they watched like five years ago
01:58:53 and they continue to compare everything to that
01:58:55 even though if they watched it again
01:58:57 then they have to select I've seen it
01:58:59 where people like rewatch something
01:59:01 and immediately realize they don't love it as much
01:59:03 as they did before but
01:59:05 because they gave it a 10 once
01:59:07 they don't want to admit they were wrong before
01:59:09 and so they keep talking about it
01:59:11 as much now but I mean it's still the greatest thing
01:59:13 well I think part of it
01:59:15 is feeling like they don't want to be wrong
01:59:17 but I think more importantly it's the feeling of
01:59:19 they have an obligation to be loyal
01:59:21 they don't want to abandon it
01:59:23 for example you did a full playthrough
01:59:25 with your brother on Sonic Adventure 2 battle
01:59:27 and it was your favorite game as a kid
01:59:29 a lot of people remember that game very fondly
01:59:31 even though it's objectively shit
01:59:33 you have no
01:59:35 you have no trouble
01:59:37 reconciling the fact that you think it's a terrible
01:59:39 game now but you thought it was an amazing game
01:59:41 then and you can simultaneously appreciate
01:59:43 your nostalgia for it while also hating it
01:59:45 you don't have to
01:59:47 continue to say it's good in order to
01:59:49 enjoy your nostalgia for it
01:59:51 and it's so much more satisfying
01:59:53 to just let your favorite stuff change
01:59:55 constantly like moviebob's favorite game is still
01:59:57 Super Mario Brothers 3 and I'm like are you fucking
01:59:59 kidding that's...
02:00:01 I don't care that you have your favorite game
02:00:03 forever the idea that your favorite
02:00:05 to change constantly is way more
02:00:07 interesting I think it's both possible
02:00:09 and probable to actually have a
02:00:11 favorite forever if it's just something that's
02:00:13 so special to you
02:00:15 and that's why letting you
02:00:17 like I think that did you if you were
02:00:19 to rewatch any show you gave a 10 and you didn't like
02:00:21 it as much you would have no trouble
02:00:23 no hesitation giving it an 8 or a 7
02:00:25 and you would totally take things
02:00:27 off your favorites list rearrange it which is
02:00:29 why the fact that Kaon has been
02:00:31 at your top for like 5 years is so
02:00:33 impressive it has not been up there for 5 years
02:00:35 but it's faltered here in your
02:00:37 it's been a little while it's been for 3 or 4 years
02:00:39 it wasn't even when I first watched it I didn't even consider
02:00:41 my favorite show of that year
02:00:43 well however many years
02:00:45 it's very impressive that it actually
02:00:47 has managed to regain that position
02:00:49 yeah it's a yeah
02:00:51 and like yeah I change stuff
02:00:53 up so much but yeah like I think that it's possible
02:00:55 to have a favorite because of the context
02:00:57 around it and like that that it's been
02:00:59 with you for so long that that's why it's your favorite
02:01:01 but again it has to be
02:01:03 genuine like my friend
02:01:05 Ghost Lightning his favorite anime has been
02:01:07 Super Dimensional Fortress Macross for like
02:01:09 27 years or something like that
02:01:11 but he rewatches it all the time
02:01:13 and like reaffirms his feelings
02:01:15 and finds new reasons that it's his favorite
02:01:17 and like recontextualizes it
02:01:19 and like has all these different reasons
02:01:21 whereas everything else in his favorites list
02:01:23 changes all the time you know it'll be like
02:01:25 oh I just watched Utena and now that's
02:01:27 my number 2 because I can't believe it's real
02:01:29 you know you have to ask yourself a question though
02:01:31 is it possible that that show
02:01:33 he could learn something about it
02:01:35 or that something else would like beat it out
02:01:37 considering all the investment he's now
02:01:39 put into loving that show
02:01:41 that's the thing I think that's valid though
02:01:43 like I don't think it's that he's blind
02:01:45 like he's very openly admitting
02:01:47 like I don't expect anyone else to feel this way
02:01:49 but here's why I feel this way
02:01:51 it's not like you're not allowed to do that
02:01:53 like there's so much to why he likes it
02:01:55 that he can go on and on and on all day
02:01:57 like I've listened to him talk for hours about
02:01:59 this is a more recently
02:02:01 exacerbated problem when
02:02:03 fan communities show up on Tumblr
02:02:05 oh god let's not even get into fan communities
02:02:07 that's a whole other
02:02:09 well the point is it makes people even more invested
02:02:11 and it means that like people have to keep
02:02:13 it's that much harder to get out of it
02:02:15 like Undertale is a single player game
02:02:17 with a few different story paths
02:02:19 and once you're done you could probably put it down for a year
02:02:21 and come back to it but because
02:02:23 so many people just draw comics and no one cares
02:02:25 but then they draw stands crying and people care
02:02:27 and now they have to care about Undertale forever
02:02:29 like mage says currently it's her favorite game ever
02:02:31 would it be without Tumblr? no definitely not
02:02:33 what would be my favorite game though
02:02:35 it's a matter of you get trapped
02:02:37 you get trapped in the idea that you're a fan
02:02:39 of this thing and that's like
02:02:41 I think the problem is just people
02:02:43 taking things as their identity
02:02:45 like identifying themselves as a fan
02:02:47 I think that's how so many of those
02:02:49 nostalgia things stick around for so long
02:02:51 is like that uh
02:02:53 cause my ex-girlfriend was pretty bad about this
02:02:55 like everything she liked as a kid was still
02:02:57 perfect to her because she liked it
02:02:59 as a kid but then I would like literally
02:03:01 watch her like re-watch something with her
02:03:03 and like see the realization
02:03:05 that I don't care about this anymore
02:03:07 but then she couldn't like admit it to herself
02:03:09 because she'd identified it
02:03:11 you know that was rough for me when I re-watched Poo's Grand Adventure recently
02:03:13 that's a movie that had a lot of
02:03:15 meaning to me and kinda shitty
02:03:17 kinda not that good
02:03:19 people just don't get it which is why they
02:03:21 when you stopped being interested in my little pony
02:03:23 that much people were like
02:03:25 you are betraying your identity
02:03:27 you are betraying the thing
02:03:29 you are betraying our entire religion
02:03:31 if you no longer like
02:03:33 this my little pony show that much
02:03:35 it's not a matter of fear
02:03:37 everything we knew about you must have been a lie as well
02:03:39 you must be losing your grip on your sanity
02:03:41 they couldn't understand that you just move on
02:03:43 to a different show
02:03:45 I've had so many people think that I became
02:03:47 a depressed and different person
02:03:49 just because I don't watch the same cartoons anymore
02:03:51 alright Jesse what else is on your list
02:03:53 let's see
02:03:55 the next one is flash
02:03:57 over substance
02:03:59 John Tron
02:04:01 what have you become
02:04:03 these days he's the prime example of that
02:04:05 I'm gonna say
02:04:07 it's not just flash over substance
02:04:09 because I think John Tron was always mostly like
02:04:11 flashy jokes
02:04:13 but do it right
02:04:15 if you're gonna have
02:04:17 take into consideration
02:04:19 what your production values mean
02:04:21 like I've been saying this a lot
02:04:23 how John Tron his set
02:04:25 does not look like a house anyone would live in
02:04:27 and therefore you do not have
02:04:29 it's like a creepy dark brick
02:04:31 fucking fortress
02:04:33 it's literally a set
02:04:35 when you watch John Tron's videos before
02:04:37 the idea was he's in his apartment
02:04:39 playing video games
02:04:41 when you look at him on the set you just think
02:04:43 why the fuck are you playing video games on a set
02:04:45 why are you doing that
02:04:47 completely undoing all the
02:04:49 comfiness of his old stuff
02:04:51 he's got this slave extra he hires
02:04:53 and he's got people coming in
02:04:55 through the door and dressing these fancy costumes
02:04:57 it's like what the
02:04:59 I actually like the Ethan Klein Kool-Aid thing
02:05:01 that was a good joke that was funny it was simple
02:05:03 it hit the point that was everything that was good about John Tron
02:05:05 he'll do these
02:05:07 he'll use these HD cameras
02:05:09 and have them
02:05:11 do these slow pans across
02:05:13 pans are not funny
02:05:15 wide angle shots are not funny
02:05:17 the close up shaky cam zoom in
02:05:19 on the face that's funny
02:05:21 that's good stuff
02:05:23 nothing will ever be funnier than
02:05:25 oh my god
02:05:27 and the camera just zooming in on him
02:05:29 making this facial expression
02:05:31 the face is funny the camera
02:05:33 mimics the joke
02:05:35 having a slow panning shot of you
02:05:37 in a weird set in HD
02:05:39 it's like this is what
02:05:41 I would expect from a product shoot
02:05:43 a fucking comedy video
02:05:45 here's basically how it works
02:05:47 the more details your joke has
02:05:49 the more every single detail has to be perfect
02:05:51 if your joke is bare bones
02:05:53 but if you're going to be complex
02:05:55 you have to be an absolute master
02:05:57 in every single medium
02:05:59 John got to this place
02:06:01 by doing the opposite of what he's doing now
02:06:03 and now he's trying to apply that same formula
02:06:05 and it's not working at all
02:06:07 it's totally wrong
02:06:09 if you're going to up your production
02:06:11 he can't be doing what he's doing now
02:06:13 if he's going to have all these high productions
02:06:15 he needs to do like, I don't know
02:06:17 something else
02:06:19 you can't just have a set
02:06:21 because it looks expensive
02:06:23 have a set because the joke involves a set
02:06:25 I get so mad when I think
02:06:27 about how much money he's wasting on this
02:06:29 only to make much worse content
02:06:31 it furiates me
02:06:33 it really hit me when
02:06:35 he had a small
02:06:37 horse pony on the set
02:06:39 and the joke was
02:06:41 I have a horse
02:06:43 and it's doing things to my set
02:06:45 it would have been a hundred times funnier
02:06:47 if he had one of his buddies in a shitty horse costume
02:06:49 that would have been so much better
02:06:51 not cost a thousand dollars for a day
02:06:53 and the whole video wasn't about horses at all
02:06:55 it was just he had the opportunity to buy a horse
02:06:57 I could never do this
02:06:59 how much funnier would it have been
02:07:01 if the joke had been
02:07:03 it was a guy and a horse
02:07:05 and he was dressed as a horse
02:07:07 it's now and then it's a guy in a horse costume
02:07:09 that would have been much fun
02:07:11 it's like some letterman shit
02:07:13 they bring out celebrities
02:07:15 and do retarded dances
02:07:17 it feels alien
02:07:19 do you think it's possible that
02:07:21 beatum has deliberately avoided buying good audio equipment
02:07:23 to create a narrative that he's some random asshole
02:07:25 throwing together something in a movie
02:07:27 in this case no
02:07:29 I think he's just cheap
02:07:31 he clearly doesn't prioritize you
02:07:33 I don't think that's the only reason
02:07:35 that he's considered getting good audio
02:07:37 he's like well if I keep it shitty
02:07:39 then I continue to look like a total jerk face head
02:07:41 and you know like
02:07:43 I don't think he really concerns himself
02:07:45 with his own YouTube narrative
02:07:47 there's three more things
02:07:49 there's only three more things on the list
02:07:51 this one is reviewing
02:07:53 people
02:07:55 don't do it
02:07:57 aren't we doing that right now
02:07:59 I mean like specifically
02:08:01 guys like Sargon of Akkad
02:08:03 really does is like pick out people
02:08:05 and that leads me to the next one
02:08:07 this is the main part of it
02:08:09 that annoys me
02:08:11 response videos
02:08:13 that pause to make a glib comment
02:08:15 about every fucking line
02:08:17 oh shit
02:08:19 Sargon of Akkad
02:08:21 even Thunderfoot kind of does it
02:08:23 he's better than most
02:08:25 amazing atheist, Shuwon head
02:08:27 all of those fucking people, TLDR
02:08:29 it is the laziest
02:08:31 whole way you can possibly do it
02:08:33 sometimes it's funny, I admit it, I've watched a lot
02:08:35 sometimes they're funny, especially like when I agree with them
02:08:37 and I'm like hey yeah fuck those guys
02:08:39 they're completely wrong, I don't give a shit about their opinion
02:08:41 like it feels good
02:08:43 but it's intellectually bankrupt
02:08:45 to act like the other person is just
02:08:47 you're just mischaracterizing everything they're doing
02:08:49 you're acting like your opinion is the only one that has
02:08:51 any value and the other people are obviously
02:08:53 objectively wrong
02:08:55 it's smug and like self-satisfied
02:08:57 and all these people are like shooting
02:08:59 over 100,000 subscribers because people
02:09:01 eat it the fuck up
02:09:03 it's like the way that children communicate
02:09:05 like you take everything a person says
02:09:07 you interrupt them and go child issues
02:09:09 second piece of shit
02:09:11 if you're gonna do it, one format that's especially bad
02:09:13 is anytime you're
02:09:15 talking it's represented by a still image
02:09:17 of your OC
02:09:19 everyone does that
02:09:21 one like 11 year old kid
02:09:23 made that for my roller coaster
02:09:25 tycoon 3 video
02:09:27 I commented so politely that he
02:09:29 deleted the video, deleted all of his videos
02:09:31 that were liked and apologized
02:09:33 and I'm like good on you
02:09:35 great example, I hate everything
02:09:37 we were talking about that the other day
02:09:39 if you do the still image
02:09:41 of your OC
02:09:43 YouTube is a fucking visual medium
02:09:45 you lazy goddamn hacks
02:09:47 everything is especially funny
02:09:49 because he's talking about Derek saying
02:09:51 I'm actually a decent person and I don't hate everything
02:09:53 and I love my work
02:09:55 even if you're on screen
02:09:57 and I also want to say
02:09:59 I hate any
02:10:01 dehumanizing arguments
02:10:03 even if someone says
02:10:05 something that you completely disagree with
02:10:07 they probably have a reason
02:10:09 and a background
02:10:11 and a reason that led them to that
02:10:13 and I understand being angry at people for being wrong
02:10:15 and spreading misinformation
02:10:17 but we're trying to
02:10:19 the way forward is conversation
02:10:21 insulting people
02:10:23 making them look like idiots
02:10:25 is not going to bring us closer to
02:10:27 like, YMS's response to Daddy Derek
02:10:29 was perfect because he was explaining
02:10:31 to him, here's the things you said
02:10:33 that are wrong, he has this very calm
02:10:35 demeanor like, I'm trying to explain it to you
02:10:37 he didn't just assume that everything was
02:10:39 obviously wrong, he didn't even need to explain it
02:10:41 he took the time and thought it out, it was good
02:10:43 he clearly came from the perspective
02:10:45 but YMS obviously thought Daddy Derek
02:10:47 just is ignorant
02:10:49 he didn't come at it like, this guy is an
02:10:51 evil monster who's trying to fuck us
02:10:53 out of our money, it's more like
02:10:55 Daddy Derek, you are ignorant
02:10:57 you don't understand what you're doing to us
02:10:59 having seen a cool cat save the kids
02:11:01 it's very understandable
02:11:03 so I think a great example of this
02:11:05 that happened to us just yesterday is
02:11:07 the gaming badger who was
02:11:09 railing on DeVoo and Jesse Wood
02:11:11 just because they said things that he doesn't agree with
02:11:13 and therefore he presents them
02:11:15 like they are fucking idiots
02:11:17 and we talk about it
02:11:19 we're all proud that Jesse blocked him on Twitter
02:11:21 and it's like, dude
02:11:23 you haven't, you have dehumanized
02:11:25 your opponent
02:11:27 have fun being proud of the fact that you're an annoying moron
02:11:29 and somebody hates you enough to block you
02:11:31 have fun, go ahead and frame it
02:11:33 on your fucking wall
02:11:35 I want you to fucking frame it so that you can look at it
02:11:37 every day and it can fucking remind you
02:11:39 what a stupid piece of shit you are
02:11:41 you dumb motherfucker
02:11:43 the day that Endless just
02:11:45 blocked you for you
02:11:47 was the most important day of your life
02:11:49 and for me, it was Tuesday
02:11:51 motherfucker
02:11:53 wait, who are you talking about?
02:11:55 it's a gaming badger
02:11:57 let's move on real quick
02:11:59 I don't hate everybody
02:12:01 who does that, I just think their videos
02:12:03 are vapid
02:12:05 they're playing the game man, they're hustling
02:12:07 so do what you gotta do
02:12:09 great minds discuss ideas
02:12:11 average minds discuss events
02:12:13 small minds discuss people
02:12:15 like Ellen Roosevelt or something
02:12:17 I think it was Ellen DeGeneres actually
02:12:19 in her leading role as Dory
02:12:21 alright, Jesse
02:12:23 and the final
02:12:25 the final thing on my list
02:12:27 the number one worst thing
02:12:29 that a reviewer can do
02:12:31 listening to jerks on the internet
02:12:33 tell you how to make your videos
02:12:35 oh, shit
02:12:37 oh, it's a mom shall be
02:12:39 and that's an excuse
02:12:41 you all failed
02:12:43 I think Jesse would self-aware
02:12:45 kind of joke right there
02:12:47 that's why he gets all the subs
02:12:49 that's why he gets the big ones
02:12:51 although
02:12:53 word of advice, take everything we've said
02:12:55 in this video very seriously
02:12:57 and please consider it, because I don't want to have to watch
02:12:59 more shitty reviews
02:13:01 I bet there are people who already sucked
02:13:03 if they tried to follow this advice
02:13:05 for some reason it'll get even worse
02:13:07 if they aren't true to their crappy selves
02:13:09 I'm not saying
02:13:11 let this inform your overall idea
02:13:13 of what a review is
02:13:15 it's all part of the artistic process
02:13:17 you put out the ideas that you think might work
02:13:19 you see how they do, and then you adjust
02:13:21 and you find out what works
02:13:23 and better yet, just rip off all of us
02:13:25 because we're all great
02:13:27 and that's the only reason
02:13:29 like DeVu said earlier
02:13:31 the reason that the five of us are friends
02:13:33 is that we all love one another's videos
02:13:35 the reason this friendship happened
02:13:37 is because each of us were very big fans
02:13:39 of what the others were doing
02:13:41 and so we all sort of became
02:13:43 this group
02:13:45 and the reason that
02:13:47 it's just that we all have the same ethos
02:13:49 and we all sort of understand reviews in a similar way
02:13:51 and we've even kind of tried to introduce
02:13:53 other people that weren't
02:13:55 that and just put them in here
02:13:57 and it just doesn't work out, they just leave
02:13:59 because I think you really need
02:14:01 if you want to impress
02:14:03 us specifically
02:14:05 please follow the rules we've talked about
02:14:07 and maybe you'll become our best friend
02:14:09 in the world
02:14:11 you could be in the procrastinators next time
02:14:13 that's your incentive to make videos that I want to watch
02:14:15 that's going to decentivize them
02:14:19 don't want to be with these fucking assholes
02:14:21 the egos are getting
02:14:23 ridiculous right now
02:14:25 I think this is our longest video
02:14:27 beating out episode one now
02:14:29 maybe only by a little bit
02:14:31 we pretty much covered what I wanted to say about
02:14:33 reviewers having rules
02:14:35 I guess my rule is
02:14:37 don't
02:14:39 just don't apply the same logic to everything
02:14:41 everything is made
02:14:43 for its own unique purpose
02:14:45 and you should be looking for
02:14:47 what is interesting and unique about that work
02:14:49 if you can watch a show
02:14:51 and be like well the pacing sucked
02:14:53 it's like by what metric
02:14:55 what are you comparing it to
02:14:57 what's the grounds here
02:14:59 I don't like it when people have a very specific
02:15:01 this is what a show should be
02:15:03 it's so narrow minded
02:15:05 and puts everything in such of a same formula
02:15:07 and box that it really
02:15:09 disturbs me
02:15:11 you need to talk about why what it attempted to do
02:15:13 either succeeded or failed
02:15:15 and it's one thing to say in pacing
02:15:17 or in passing rather
02:15:19 the pacing bothered me
02:15:21 but if you're writing a reviewer analysis
02:15:23 you have to justify that
02:15:25 you have to justify that belief
02:15:27 because that's the point of a reviewer analysis
02:15:29 is not to state your opinions
02:15:31 because I don't give a fuck about your opinions
02:15:33 it's to justify your opinions
02:15:35 that's the purpose
02:15:37 yeah
02:15:39 to just want to say
02:15:41 if you haven't
02:15:43 if you've always wanted to
02:15:45 do reviews and stuff
02:15:47 don't let us like all these rules
02:15:49 intimidate you into not trying
02:15:51 you're allowed to make a lot of mistakes
02:15:53 and make a load of shitty videos
02:15:55 the only way to make good videos is to make a lot of shitty videos
02:15:57 eventually if you keep trying to improve you way
02:15:59 I think
02:16:01 for the number one thing is
02:16:03 just don't send them to me
02:16:05 make all those shitty videos
02:16:07 just don't make me watch them until you're confident
02:16:09 sure
02:16:11 I mean I know it's obvious
02:16:13 but you know do the videos you want to do
02:16:15 like if you want to have an ultimate example
02:16:17 the new storyteller makes videos for himself
02:16:19 and him alone and he clearly really likes
02:16:21 doing it is that that sonic guy
02:16:23 no he's a guy who does that
02:16:25 Thomas the Tank engine
02:16:27 that guy
02:16:29 yes
02:16:31 what was his name said again
02:16:33 the new storyteller
02:16:35 well over 10,000
02:16:37 Thomas the Tank engine
02:16:39 he's the most prolific person ever
02:16:41 he makes like three a day
02:16:43 and they're long
02:16:45 they reach like two hours
02:16:47 so do what you want
02:16:49 because I think a lot of people just really like making boring videos
02:16:51 and if you just want to come to peace
02:16:53 to terms with that
02:16:55 oh I have no qualms with anybody
02:16:57 who does something just because they want to
02:16:59 like just because it seems like
02:17:01 I have problems with people who want to be famous
02:17:03 or they want to be in the reviewer circles
02:17:05 or they want to be just like their idols
02:17:07 and then they completely misinterpret it
02:17:09 well because you see for me the number
02:17:11 one of my biggest incentives for being on this
02:17:13 for what I'm talking about here is there's this guy who does
02:17:15 really basic videos
02:17:17 very basic videos that tell me nothing
02:17:19 but then he also feels bad because he can't come up with ideas
02:17:21 and he doesn't understand
02:17:23 and he's not
02:17:25 he's like unsatisfied with his videos
02:17:27 but he's not trying to pursue
02:17:29 something interesting
02:17:31 what do you do with people like that dude?
02:17:33 you tell him just like keep trying
02:17:35 there was a great Ernest Hemingway
02:17:37 that I just saw on Twitter today
02:17:39 which was
02:17:41 if you think you want to be a
02:17:43 it was anyone who wants to be a writer
02:17:45 but doesn't write doesn't
02:17:47 sure
02:17:49 if you think you want to be a writer
02:17:51 if you don't like writing don't try to write
02:17:53 and that's exactly what happened to me
02:17:55 we were discussing this last night
02:17:57 that I didn't you know for a long time
02:17:59 I thought I was going to be a filmmaker
02:18:01 I thought I was going to be a novelist
02:18:03 and I really for like years put myself in that mindset
02:18:05 that that's what I was going to do
02:18:07 and then I just didn't write
02:18:09 and at some point I woke up to the fact that
02:18:11 if I'm not writing like everyone who is a good writer
02:18:13 who writes professionally
02:18:15 all they like to do is write
02:18:17 Stephen King pumps out a book every year
02:18:19 literally all he likes doing
02:18:21 if it doesn't come
02:18:23 like if it's not something that you
02:18:25 innately want to do
02:18:27 then maybe it's not for you
02:18:29 like if it's something you have to force yourself
02:18:31 and you don't even enjoy it
02:18:33 and you just feel like you have to because it's obligated
02:18:35 you know
02:18:37 because this shit is hard fucking work
02:18:39 this takes a long ass time to make something
02:18:41 like all of my videos are completely out of like
02:18:43 I can't live with myself not sharing these opinions
02:18:45 you know
02:18:47 especially Jesse is the most like
02:18:49 I can't do anything but make videos
02:18:51 and therefore that's what I'm going to do
02:18:53 guy you know
02:18:55 yeah like if your only way to make
02:18:57 like let's say by default you make your videos
02:18:59 shittily like they don't have good production values
02:19:01 but if
02:19:03 by making the videos well produced
02:19:05 and following these rules that we've outlined
02:19:07 makes it completely not fun for you
02:19:09 like obviously making the videos good
02:19:11 takes a lot of work and it gets really tedious
02:19:13 but if the work
02:19:15 really drains your
02:19:17 enjoyment of it
02:19:19 then just make shitty videos
02:19:21 because then those videos would have more soul
02:19:23 and soul counts for something
02:19:25 make shitty videos and don't complain that you're not popular
02:19:27 and don't send them to people
02:19:29 don't complain that we're making fun of you
02:19:31 the number one golden rule everybody
02:19:33 the only one that is really important
02:19:35 the only audience that
02:19:37 matters is you yourself
02:19:39 fuck everyone else
02:19:41 the audience is always wrong
02:19:43 everyone can go fucking take a long walk
02:19:45 off a short pier
02:19:47 anyone who tells you what to do
02:19:49 or fucking fuck them all
02:19:51 fuck them the golden rule
02:19:53 as always
02:19:55 doctor horseshoes golden rule
02:19:57 fuck them
02:19:59 alright that's it everybody
02:20:01 see you next time on the procrastinator's podcast
02:20:03 hopefully you gained some insight
02:20:05 into this or just enjoyed the catharsis
02:20:07 of listening to us beat up on
02:20:09 people
02:20:11 just some real shit
02:20:13 as soon as you said your big point
02:20:15 it was your skype
02:20:17 I just laid down the most inspirational shit
02:20:19 and no one will ever hear it
02:20:21 but it'll be in the recording though
02:20:23 rest easy
02:20:25 my friend
