00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of Rikstie Minutes. It's me, I'm Best, I'm Best, and we got Dig.
00:00:09 I don't give a fuck, bitch, doing this show the only way that you should, which is under the influence of alcohol.
00:00:16 Good, good. I'm keeping it sober, I'm keeping a clean cut over here, because that's just the kind of fucking dude I am. What can I say?
00:00:26 So what do you think of this episode here, Digi?
00:00:30 It's alright. I like the concept, and there were a couple of lines of dialogue that were rewarding to me on a meta level, more so than perhaps much of the episode.
00:00:43 I feel like while I like this as an episode idea, it's weird that they framed this as a replacement for dimensional cable, because I don't think it was really that similar.
00:00:56 Maybe they just did that to assure us that they weren't going to do one this season.
00:01:00 I suppose so.
00:01:02 Because I was expecting, because in season two when they did it, Rik did a fourth wall break and said we're doing it again because everyone loved it last time.
00:01:12 I didn't think they'd do it a third time, because A, they've done it twice already, and B, the response to the second one was not nearly as favorable as the original.
00:01:23 So I was thinking that if they addressed it all, there will be another fourth wall break, and we got that at the start of the episode.
00:01:30 And that was really gratifying for me on a meta level, the fact that Rik said we're doing this instead of dimensional cable, and I went, oh, like, of course.
00:01:38 But then I think that accidentally set me up to expect it to be anything like dimensional cable, which it's really not.
00:01:47 Instead of crazy vignettes where they just spitball lines and then animate around them in a very appealing aesthetic kind of way, like with the two brothers.
00:02:01 It's just called two brothers.
00:02:04 That's classic shit. Everybody loves that.
00:02:06 And this was just a bunch of mini Rik and Morty adventures just smashed into one thing, and they were all new.
00:02:12 They were all original. They were cool.
00:02:15 But yeah, it came away a bit lukewarm.
00:02:18 It's a bunch of episodes that were decent.
00:02:22 That's even selling it short. They were good. Some of them were quite interesting and quite funny, but in the end, we're just left with a bunch of shallow experiences that were kind of cheap fun.
00:02:32 Yeah, but the weird thing about it is that they're not going...
00:02:36 This felt more like a story episode to me.
00:02:39 With the dimensional cable, and granted, the first dimensional cable did have one of the most gripping narrative moments in the show with the family.
00:02:50 But the dimensional cable itself is like a totally ridiculous unscripted goofy shit.
00:02:57 And I think the reason the second one wasn't as well received was that both stories were...
00:03:03 The dimensional cable itself was the same as before. It's just a bunch of retarded bullshit that's hilarious.
00:03:08 But then the B plot was also really dumb, and so it didn't have the impact the original episode had.
00:03:13 This one, though, if they had never mentioned dimensional cable, this would have just seemed like an episode of Rik and Morty.
00:03:21 The point is this idea that Rik has been taking all these memories from Morty, some of them by Morty's request,
00:03:28 and some of them because Rik got rid of them on purpose for his own reasons, usually which are hilariously petty.
00:03:36 Probably my favorite memory is the one where Rik just says a word wrong.
00:03:43 He says taking for granted, everybody.
00:03:47 As opposed to taking for granted, and Morty calls him out on it, and he erased that memory from Morty's mind.
00:03:55 There's also one where Morty beat him at checkers.
00:04:01 While he was drunk, he wasn't even probably trying, and he still erased that memory.
00:04:08 I'd be interested to know the creation process for this episode, because later on, Rik repeatedly says several times,
00:04:16 Stop thinking of this as a lesson learning thing. Stop thinking of this as a normal narrative episode.
00:04:21 This is a vignette episode. Stop taking it so seriously.
00:04:24 He was quite clear to make that point, but it manifests.
00:04:28 The resulting we get of these micro episodes are good, but they're less out there and wacky and fun than the crazy shit you saw on interdimensional cable.
00:04:41 That's the thing. They're less weird than a normal Rick and Morty episode a lot of the time.
00:04:47 Even though these are the ones that are supposed to drive him literally insane, that's what we were promised at the beginning.
00:04:54 Usually it's just that Morty accidentally got someone killed in some kind of horrific way, and that's why he had the memory erased.
00:05:02 While those stories are funny and fun, they're not so weird that it doesn't feel like a normal episode of Rick and Morty.
00:05:11 Here's the other line that was deeply satisfying to me on a meta level, which is where at the very end of the episode,
00:05:19 when Rick and Morty are both calling Summer a bitch for no reason, she says,
00:05:25 no wonder you're arguing constantly and always behind schedule.
00:05:29 They're like, would you say it? She's like, nothing.
00:05:31 I was like, ah, there we go. That's why this episode happened.
00:05:37 Because Justin Roiland wanted to do another interdimensional cable and some more unscripted bullshit,
00:05:43 and Dan Harmon wants the show to be a serious drama show.
00:05:51 If you go back to the original episode, Dan Harmon wrote the half of the episode that was a completely serious story that was heart-wrenching,
00:06:00 was written by Dan Harmon, and the other half was Justin Roiland doing improv in a booth.
00:06:07 I think that maybe there was disagreement about how the second one had gone,
00:06:15 where maybe, now I haven't listened to the commentaries on season two yet,
00:06:18 which I've been meaning to do this whole fucking time when I've never gotten around to,
00:06:22 but I should, and then I want to hear the commentaries on this season,
00:06:26 because I've kind of followed the production background of Rick and Morty a bit,
00:06:30 not only through having listened to the commentaries, but also when season two was airing,
00:06:35 and I don't know if any of this has happened for season three, I haven't paid enough attention,
00:06:38 but when season two was airing, for the first episode and the last episode,
00:06:43 Justin Roiland, like, periscoped and live-streamed the parties that they threw.
00:06:51 Oh, I remember that, yeah.
00:06:53 Yeah, and during those, during the first one was one of the most fascinating things I've ever watched in my life,
00:07:02 specifically because of the fact that half of their people were being poached actively at the time.
00:07:09 Right, right.
00:07:10 They were talking about how their lead guy, their lead writer for that season,
00:07:15 had just been poached by Disney, and Justin Roiland was saying,
00:07:18 like, if the show goes downhill next season, it's because we lost this guy,
00:07:22 and he said things like, you know, everyone was saying that, like,
00:07:26 because Justin does so much on the show is why it takes so long to come out,
00:07:29 and like, just not having enough talent on the show is why it's always behind schedule,
00:07:35 and why, you know, and like, because the talent that is there gets poached by better networks
00:07:41 who can pay them more, you know, and so they all leave, so no one stays on the show for long enough.
00:07:47 So, like, if Rick and Morty were to go downhill, it would be because they couldn't spend two years
00:07:54 letting Justin and Dan do everything on the show, you know.
00:07:58 Now, obviously, the season's been pretty great, so they've found, they must have found someone.
00:08:04 They've just strapped some shit together, yeah, they're working that out so far.
00:08:07 But, like, hearing them mention the idea that, like, oh, you two argue constantly are behind schedule,
00:08:13 and the fact that it was directed at Rick and Morty, like, themselves, like,
00:08:17 because if it had been directed at more characters, I'd assume the whole cast,
00:08:20 or everyone involved is always arguing, but, like, framing it that way made it,
00:08:24 like, Justin and Dan are arguing all the time and always behind schedule,
00:08:28 and, like, it's easy to imagine.
00:08:30 Of course, that's exactly what it comes off as, yeah.
00:08:32 I'm saying people, like, just in the last episode of this podcast,
00:08:35 I was talking about how Dan Harmon is known for being impossible to work with
00:08:38 and a total piece of shit, and Justin Roiland's fucking crazy.
00:08:42 This is a guy who, last year, just leaked all this, like, information about a show he was trying to,
00:08:50 like, he was working with Fox on.
00:08:52 I don't know if this has been canceled by now, or if it's just, you know,
00:08:56 I don't know how far along it ever was, but he just, like, leaks all this information about his own show
00:09:00 that he had been selling Fox.
00:09:02 Okay, cool. This is news to me, but all right.
00:09:04 It was, he got really shit.
00:09:06 Why would you do that? Who was the point of that?
00:09:08 He got shit-faced and leaked all this info, and he was, he posted,
00:09:12 he posted the text logs he was having with, like, the lead writer on the show,
00:09:16 the guy was, or producer, who was telling him, like,
00:09:19 what the fuck are you doing? And he was screaming all caps at the guy,
00:09:23 this is new media, you motherfucker, like, stop living in the past.
00:09:27 We're in the future now, like, Twitter is the future,
00:09:30 like, you can't hide shit behind corporate backgrounds and stuff like that,
00:09:34 like, he's just out, like, he's doing what I would do, basically.
00:09:38 Yeah, but he's doing it while trying to make a pitch to Fox or whatever, so, like, not...
00:09:43 I think they already owned the show, like, it was a show that's in pre-production
00:09:48 that may or may not come to exist.
00:09:50 Okay, it's just like, oh, look at me, I'm such a rebel,
00:09:52 while I work for a giant corporation making their cartoon, like,
00:09:55 it seems like a double-stamp, but okay, whatever, that's fine.
00:09:58 Well, I think he saw it as a promotional thing,
00:10:01 like, let's promote this show in a very modern way
00:10:05 by releasing all this information and just being transparent about it,
00:10:09 which is how I think, you know.
00:10:11 That makes more sense.
00:10:13 But the point is that Justin really doesn't play by the rules,
00:10:16 and he's insane, you know, he kind of comes from the internet.
00:10:20 He's originally an internet guy, like, he's from Hollywood,
00:10:23 but he's from the Hollywood internet, you know?
00:10:25 What even is that? What is the Hollywood internet?
00:10:27 Like, what sort of things do Hollywood internet people do?
00:10:30 Have you ever heard of Channel 101?
00:10:32 I am aware of the Channel 101 stuff.
00:10:34 That's where Rick and Morty comes from.
00:10:36 The original short was on there.
00:10:38 But Channel 101, like, was supposed to be...
00:10:41 The idea of it was that it was, like, people who work in TV.
00:10:46 Like, it was people who were, like, sick of the restrictions
00:10:49 of what TV made them do.
00:10:51 And so they went and made this other place
00:10:53 where they could break copyright law without getting punished.
00:10:57 They could, like, basically do whatever the fuck they want.
00:11:01 It was, like, a guerrilla filmmaking thing.
00:11:03 But, like, everyone involved with it was people who...
00:11:05 Like, Dan Harmon was involved with Channel 101.
00:11:07 Like, these were all people who worked in TV,
00:11:09 but were, like, looking for an escape on the internet.
00:11:12 It just didn't blow up that big.
00:11:14 The only show that I think anybody really knows is Yacht Rock
00:11:16 and Cautionary Tales of Swords, which are both amazing.
00:11:19 Of course, of course.
00:11:21 But that's why those shows have a little bit more production
00:11:23 than the average YouTube show,
00:11:25 because, like, it was a channel they were trying to launch online,
00:11:28 which Dan Harmon tried to do recently,
00:11:30 like, his show Harmon Town,
00:11:33 which was the Dungeons & Dragons show.
00:11:37 Do you know about that?
00:11:38 Oh, that's right. I know of it in general.
00:11:40 I haven't seen any of it.
00:11:42 Yeah, they just animated, like, over a...
00:11:44 Like, they played D&D live in front of an audience
00:11:47 and then animated the campaign.
00:11:49 It's alright.
00:11:51 It sounded like a terrible idea.
00:11:53 Okay, nobody understands that D&D is the most boring thing
00:11:56 in the fucking world if you're not actually playing.
00:11:58 But it's all comedians, though.
00:12:00 Well, okay, if they know what they're doing, it's...
00:12:02 It's alright.
00:12:03 Is this that show that you see the fucking trailers for
00:12:05 on, like, YouTube ads and shit all the time?
00:12:07 Because it looks like the worst thing ever.
00:12:09 Are you implying that I watch YouTube ads?
00:12:12 Well, I mean, I skip them as much as possible,
00:12:14 but I see that on mobile.
00:12:16 The point is that it was on this new...
00:12:18 Dan Harmon and a bunch of other people tried to create,
00:12:21 like, their own Hulu, like, a subscription service
00:12:24 to watch, like, specific shows.
00:12:26 But it went as well as Tidal did.
00:12:28 Right.
00:12:29 Trying to do the same thing, which is,
00:12:31 you can't take people away from the websites they want to use
00:12:34 and make them pay to watch content
00:12:37 that they don't even know what it is, you know?
00:12:39 Yep, I hear you.
00:12:40 No one's gonna download Tidal so they can hear
00:12:42 the new Kanye West album if they haven't already heard it
00:12:45 and confirmed they liked it.
00:12:47 They just want to pay for it normally.
00:12:49 But anyways.
00:12:51 Like, there's a reason I didn't buy 4.44, Jay-Z.
00:12:54 I downloaded that shit because I can't buy it anywhere.
00:12:57 It's only on fucking Tidal.
00:12:59 Who's gonna do that? Not me.
00:13:01 Well...
00:13:02 Not that it matters to him. He has a little money in there.
00:13:04 In any case...
00:13:05 Okay, so that's all cool.
00:13:07 But I just did want to say about all that whole point
00:13:09 basically tied into that meta comment
00:13:11 that Summer makes at the end of this episode here.
00:13:13 And, okay, so, like, yes.
00:13:15 That is the lampshade hanging.
00:13:17 Sort of explain...
00:13:19 Possibly, as you just placed it forward.
00:13:21 Explaining, like, why this episode seems to be disjointed
00:13:25 and have, like, a half that's, you know, story-based,
00:13:28 that doesn't really go anywhere,
00:13:30 and then the other free-form thing that also feels kind of awkward.
00:13:32 So, okay, we've got this basically explanation,
00:13:35 but that doesn't retroactively make the episode more entertaining
00:13:38 or, like, more good.
00:13:40 It just gives me sort of a sense of satisfaction.
00:13:42 It is an interesting thought about, like,
00:13:45 why this production is...
00:13:48 Why it took Season 3 so long to come out.
00:13:50 You know, why they released the April 1st episode
00:13:53 that took another three months for the episode.
00:13:55 For the season, you know, like...
00:13:58 Just the idea that Dan and Justin fight all the time
00:14:01 is entertaining to me because I can easily imagine it.
00:14:04 You know, like, these guys are insane people.
00:14:06 And, um...
00:14:08 I don't know if that's why the episode itself
00:14:11 is like how it is, but it would certainly explain
00:14:14 why, like, I could easily imagine Justin being, like,
00:14:17 why not do another interdimensional cable?
00:14:20 Like, why not? I love it.
00:14:22 You know, and Dan being like,
00:14:24 we didn't go...
00:14:26 We're making it emotional, you know.
00:14:28 Fucking Dan.
00:14:31 I don't know, man.
00:14:33 I almost feel like it's a waste of time
00:14:35 to even go into any of the details of the episode.
00:14:37 Like, the moon thing, kind of funny, I guess.
00:14:40 Yeah, I don't even blame them for that
00:14:42 because of the fact that, like, I loved the second
00:14:44 interdimensional cable, but that one did get a lot of flag.
00:14:46 Like, I know people who think that episode's bad.
00:14:49 And, like...
00:14:50 I can't imagine why.
00:14:52 I guess Monkey said...
00:14:54 I think Monkey's dissed that episode before.
00:14:56 Really? But what's his argument that it's just too redundant?
00:14:58 It's just the same idea again?
00:15:00 I think just because, I mean,
00:15:02 the Jerry half of the episode's not that funny.
00:15:04 That's true.
00:15:05 I'll give him that, but...
00:15:07 And the skits aren't as memorable as the first time.
00:15:09 I just feel like I could watch an infinite number of those.
00:15:12 That's what I was gonna say.
00:15:13 They don't all have to be as good as one another.
00:15:16 I will watch as many of those as you make
00:15:18 because they're fucking hilarious in concept alone, you know?
00:15:21 I feel the very same.
00:15:23 But, you know, I could see why
00:15:26 that episode was pretty criticized,
00:15:28 so I could see why they'd not want to take that route again.
00:15:30 Yeah, I guess so.
00:15:32 I don't know, man.
00:15:33 I got nothing to fucking say about, like, the individual.
00:15:35 Like, oh, it was so funny when the worm came out of Morty's mouth
00:15:38 and they were like, lol, it's poop.
00:15:39 That was great.
00:15:40 Just pinch it off, dude.
00:15:41 You know?
00:15:42 Okay, I got a laugh out of that,
00:15:43 but then, like, I don't know, like, the joke dragged a little bit,
00:15:46 and I was like, okay, I get it.
00:15:47 Let's wrap this thing up.
00:15:48 The Moonman joke dragged,
00:15:50 and, like, the high point of the joke of the Moonman thing
00:15:53 was, like, uh...
00:15:54 Huh.
00:15:55 Huh.
00:15:56 Okay, I get it.
00:15:57 Yeah.
00:15:58 It's good.
00:15:59 You know?
00:16:00 I agree.
00:16:01 There was no real massive peek.
00:16:02 Lol, he's jacking the dude off when he thinks he's torturing him.
00:16:05 Kind of funny, but, like, it's...
00:16:07 I don't...
00:16:08 Yeah, they weren't that funny.
00:16:09 They weren't that funny.
00:16:10 They weren't that funny.
00:16:11 The funniest line in the episode by far to me
00:16:14 is immediately after Rick and Morty accidentally mind-wipe themselves,
00:16:20 and after Morty's first memory, he says,
00:16:23 I guess we're kind of like the men in black.
00:16:25 Yeah.
00:16:26 And he asks Rick if he remembers men in black,
00:16:28 and Rick says, I've only got men in black, too.
00:16:31 And he says, well, then you get the concept, and he goes,
00:16:33 well, actually, it's mostly random callbacks to the first movie in there.
00:16:37 Like, fucking...
00:16:39 I lost it at that joke.
00:16:41 A couple more at the end of the episode.
00:16:43 All the jokes that really made me laugh weren't even in the memories,
00:16:46 except for when Morty beat Rick at Checkers,
00:16:49 and that made me laugh.
00:16:51 That was good.
00:16:52 I went back and watched some of those, like, really fast clip show things that went by.
00:16:56 Yeah, like, there was some...
00:16:57 I like when they can cram.
00:16:58 The fast ones were better than the long ones.
00:17:00 I know, they were.
00:17:01 They were.
00:17:02 But then again...
00:17:03 You know, honestly, some of them felt like they were legitimately, like,
00:17:06 rejected ideas from the show.
00:17:08 Yeah, yeah.
00:17:09 Like, that Moon Man one could have been a full episode if they wanted to be.
00:17:13 Or just, like, all of these were just things that they thought of for, like,
00:17:16 minor subplots and then didn't do.
00:17:18 And then they just went, like,
00:17:20 let's just fill an episode with all of our extra bullshit that we thought was kind of funny.
00:17:24 You know, the way that at the beginning, like,
00:17:26 Rick is like, oh, we're doing a clip show, but they're all new clips.
00:17:29 Like, oh, these are ideas we threw away,
00:17:31 but at least they're new.
00:17:33 Here they are, everybody.
00:17:34 You know, we got them on the table.
00:17:35 The way he phrased it made it sound like it was stuff they'd thrown out, you know.
00:17:40 You know what?
00:17:41 I'm just gonna pin this one on the fucking women writers.
00:17:43 Those goddamn fucking women writers.
00:17:46 You can't trust them as far as you can throw them.
00:17:48 Why they gotta ruin Rick and Morty in every way like this?
00:17:51 Actually, my favorite scene is when Morty's gonna kill himself,
00:17:56 and Rick is, like, inspired to join him in a suicide pact.
00:17:59 I do like that.
00:18:00 That's just such a Rick moment.
00:18:03 Like, that's what I love about his character,
00:18:05 is the idea that he'd be like, you know what?
00:18:07 I am down to kill myself.
00:18:09 Let's do this, motherfucker, you know.
00:18:11 Yeah, I like that reckless side to it.
00:18:13 And then Summer coming in just like, oh, you guys are doing this again.
00:18:15 I was like, ah, you got me.
00:18:17 Yeah, we all got cucked.
00:18:19 I wanted to see him fucking die.
00:18:21 I really like this idea that Rick,
00:18:24 because he's so insanely well-prepared and has so much shit set up,
00:18:28 and generally is only kind of afraid of death.
00:18:32 We'll just let these scenarios play out.
00:18:34 Like, you know, he openly says this isn't the first time we've done this.
00:18:38 Like, we've literally gone down this road before,
00:18:41 just because he can write all his memories after it's over, you know.
00:18:44 And the fact that he has set-ups for even if him and Morty accidentally wipe,
00:18:49 like, even this has happened before.
00:18:52 Even them forgetting it happened has happened before.
00:18:55 That's right, that's right.
00:18:56 There's preparations for it, and I...
00:18:59 Yeah, that's what I love about Rick and this show.
00:19:02 That's good stuff.
00:19:03 And, you know, just the idea of...
00:19:06 Yeah, like, it makes sense that it just reinforces the whole thing.
00:19:09 Like, not only is Rick able to go to infinite realities,
00:19:12 and like, just if everyone dies here, he'll just go somewhere else.
00:19:15 Everyone's fine, like, so, you know, his detachment has begun at that point.
00:19:18 But now, even though he's able to just remove memories from himself
00:19:21 and anyone else and replace them, it's just another layer of, like,
00:19:24 yeah, like, why would I give a shit about anything?
00:19:26 I can just wipe those memories.
00:19:27 Nothing matters whatsoever.
00:19:29 Yeah, exactly.
00:19:30 It's all just entertaining, you know.
00:19:31 And I think this episode was helped for me also by the fact that I actually...
00:19:36 I watched the first 15 minutes, and then I had to stop
00:19:38 because I had to do other shit, and then I watched the last five minutes just now.
00:19:41 And I really think the last five minutes saved the episode.
00:19:44 Like, I think up till that point, I thought it was okay.
00:19:48 And I was like, alright, there's moments in here I like, but some of it's dumb.
00:19:52 The very end, I thought, is the best part.
00:19:55 Like, just when it actually, when it stops being just a clip show
00:19:59 and becomes about them, you know, doing the suicide pact
00:20:02 and, like, this meta idea that they've been doing this before
00:20:05 was way funnier than any of the actual stories they told.
00:20:08 That's true.
00:20:10 Yeah, I don't know, man.
00:20:11 I was just pretty disappointed overall in terms of the laugh-o-meter.
00:20:16 Yeah.
00:20:17 I don't know.
00:20:18 The stories were not that good.
00:20:19 They really felt cutting room.
00:20:21 They didn't feel original, and, like, they felt like stuff
00:20:24 that wasn't supposed to be in the show, that you watch and go,
00:20:26 oh, that should have been cut.
00:20:28 Like, I know why you guys didn't put that in the episode
00:20:31 because it wasn't that good, you know?
00:20:34 Yeah, I don't know, man.
00:20:35 And maybe that's why she was, maybe that's also part of the reference
00:20:38 to them being behind schedule, is like, they don't have time,
00:20:43 so they threw in an episode of, like, you know, half-complete shit.
00:20:47 Who knows?
00:20:48 Yeah, we'll never know.
00:20:49 I can't wait for, I cannot wait for the commentaries for this episode
00:20:52 because I think this episode, while by itself is not that great,
00:20:56 will be far more interesting to hear it talked about
00:20:59 than it will be to have watched it.
00:21:01 That's a great point.
00:21:02 I would love to hear the commentary on this episode.
00:21:04 Yeah, yeah.
00:21:05 More than any other episode so far this season.
00:21:08 Yeah, and I have a very different kind of engagement with this show, I think,
00:21:11 than this, you know, this is, I think we should address this, Nate.
00:21:15 This has been a weirdly controversial podcast a lot of the time.
00:21:19 On occasion, that's true.
00:21:21 I think it might just be because, like, people watch this who,
00:21:26 maybe there's a lot of people who watch this who just are Rick and Morty fans,
00:21:30 like, maybe these episodes get found, I have no idea,
00:21:33 because they do get pretty high view counts for views, shows on this channel.
00:21:37 They get more views than any other thing on this channel, it's true.
00:21:40 Yeah, which is really weird.
00:21:43 But the comments are often, like, aggressively against us,
00:21:47 and they have bigger dislike bars than our normal videos.
00:21:49 So I think people come in here just looking for Rick and Morty reviews,
00:21:53 and when we, for instance, of the last episode,
00:21:57 went on a seven-minute rant about whether or not Dan Harmon is a liberal cuck,
00:22:03 we got a lot of flak for that.
00:22:05 Rick and fuck off, that's the good shit, that's the good shit.
00:22:08 Yeah, no, but that's sometimes, I mean, for one thing,
00:22:11 in this episode, the whole time watching the episode,
00:22:13 I thought, I'm gonna have nothing to say about this.
00:22:15 Like, I wasn't even sure if I was gonna be able to do a podcast
00:22:18 until the meta thing came through, and I went,
00:22:20 well, I can talk about that for 20 minutes, you know?
00:22:22 And that's filled up 90% of the time we've been talking right now.
00:22:25 Yeah.
00:22:27 How worried were you?
00:22:29 I'm never worried.
00:22:30 I have developed a level of confidence that can talk for any amount of time about anything.
00:22:35 I'll find a way.
00:22:36 Yeah, that's how I felt.
00:22:38 I was just basically gonna reiterate how unfunny,
00:22:41 I don't wanna, like, oversell how unfunny this was.
00:22:44 It was like, I did get some chuckles, I got some smiles,
00:22:47 there were some goofs in there, like the fact that the Moonman winked.
00:22:49 This is like a strong six episode, I think.
00:22:51 Yeah, around there, around there.
00:22:53 Like, I actually, I watched it twice, actually,
00:22:55 just because I had time while I was editing some other shit.
00:22:57 And the first time, I liked it more the first time,
00:23:00 because I just let it wash over me,
00:23:02 and just let the memes fall where they may,
00:23:04 and was like, yeah, pretty positive.
00:23:06 Then the second time.
00:23:07 Yeah, I'm imagining watching the whole Moonman section again,
00:23:11 and like, no, it wouldn't be worth it.
00:23:14 It's not that funny, like the payoff wasn't that good.
00:23:17 The idea that he was literally a smudge on the lens doesn't really make sense
00:23:21 with what we saw in the beginning.
00:23:23 He moves, he moves in like the first thing,
00:23:25 so like, it makes literally no sense,
00:23:27 but that's kind of what makes it funny, that it makes absolutely no sense.
00:23:31 I don't know if that makes it funnier to me.
00:23:33 Oh, he literally was a smudge on the lens, that's predictable.
00:23:37 Rick and Morty really does a good job of basically explaining everything
00:23:41 and never contradicting its own logic,
00:23:43 and that definitely does contradict its own logic
00:23:45 in a way that one could criticize.
00:23:47 I just think that like, it's a wash, like who cares
00:23:49 if that like doesn't make sense in this particular case.
00:23:52 But, you know, it's a fair criticism.
00:23:54 If I was the mysterious Mr. Enter, which I am,
00:23:57 I would deduct massive points for that tragic logical break.
00:24:01 It would be a big problem for me.
00:24:03 There's also stuff, probably the most predictable joke in the entire show,
00:24:08 and maybe it's fine that it's predictable,
00:24:11 is when Rick types in like twisty ties or whatever into his magnet
00:24:18 and gets a bunch of them, which I thought that was really funny.
00:24:21 And then as soon as it shows Morty typing in,
00:24:23 and I went, he's typing in tits.
00:24:25 And then a bunch of chicks with huge tits fly into the house,
00:24:28 and I went, yep, you know, like,
00:24:30 I think it was less funny because I knew exactly,
00:24:32 because it was obvious.
00:24:34 Like, what, if it had been anything else,
00:24:36 it would have been funnier because I didn't predict it.
00:24:38 But it was exactly what I thought it would be.
00:24:41 They're going pretty, okay, I noticed that specifically
00:24:43 all those women were also redheaded.
00:24:45 So like, it's clearly like a Jessica thing
00:24:47 that he was doing at that moment.
00:24:48 They're really going hard with the Jessica thing.
00:24:51 Like, honestly, that kind of like,
00:24:54 it's been annoying me a little bit.
00:24:56 Why is Morty so into this one girl?
00:24:58 Like, wouldn't he just fuck anyone?
00:25:00 What's the deal?
00:25:01 What's the deal here?
00:25:02 I honestly feel like it's kind of a feminine perspective here.
00:25:05 Like, you know, as a guy, I'd fuck anyone.
00:25:08 I'd fuck anyone.
00:25:09 How is that a feminine perspective
00:25:11 that he is more in love with Jessica?
00:25:14 I think it's just that they're taking that direction.
00:25:17 You don't think it's more feminine to be fixated on,
00:25:19 like, one person and have that kind of,
00:25:21 because the men sow the field.
00:25:23 The men sow the field.
00:25:24 The women...
00:25:25 I don't think so at all.
00:25:27 Whatever, man.
00:25:28 You're like denying the existence of sluts right now.
00:25:31 Like, what are you fucking talking about?
00:25:33 We're having the exact debate right now
00:25:35 from Eyes Wide Shut
00:25:36 between Natalie Portman and Tom Cruise.
00:25:38 I haven't seen Eyes Wide Shut.
00:25:39 You should, but that's exactly the debate
00:25:40 we're having right now.
00:25:41 One of my favorite movies.
00:25:42 Everybody watch it.
00:25:43 I highly doubt that that is at all involved
00:25:46 in the intentions.
00:25:47 I think they're trying to make Jessica
00:25:48 a more important character
00:25:49 because she's going to be relevant.
00:25:50 She has been getting more scenes.
00:25:52 That's true.
00:25:53 Because if you watch...
00:25:54 If you go back to season one,
00:25:57 Jessica...
00:25:58 We mentioned this before,
00:25:59 that she was kind of a non-...
00:26:01 She's just a girl who Morty has a crush on.
00:26:03 Every once in a while,
00:26:04 they feed you a little idea
00:26:05 that maybe she could like him
00:26:07 in that classic 80s movie kind of way,
00:26:10 but it's not that important.
00:26:11 And in the episode where Morty gets a sex spot,
00:26:14 he doesn't seem to give a fuck.
00:26:16 Granted, in the last episode,
00:26:18 he objectively fucked a bunch of mermaids.
00:26:21 He sure did.
00:26:22 He's not a virgin.
00:26:23 So, like, I think in season one,
00:26:26 the idea was more Morty's this dorky virgin
00:26:29 and he likes this girl
00:26:30 because he's just into her.
00:26:32 But at this point,
00:26:33 I think it's more that he legitimately
00:26:36 finds her more attractive than anyone else
00:26:38 and is in love with her.
00:26:39 But why?
00:26:40 I've never heard a reason like why.
00:26:41 Because I think they want to make her
00:26:43 a major character.
00:26:44 Well, that would explain it, I guess.
00:26:46 Even though that's not really...
00:26:47 She hasn't done anything other than be hot.
00:26:50 And he's fucked countless mermaids less.
00:26:52 Some people have...
00:26:53 Some people just have one person there.
00:26:55 My fucking brother, Victor, chased his...
00:26:58 The girl he's now dating,
00:26:59 he chased for six years
00:27:00 because he literally couldn't find anyone else attractive.
00:27:03 Oh, boy.
00:27:04 We're gonna get into serious red pill territory
00:27:05 if I go down this road.
00:27:06 Let's not dig too deep into that.
00:27:09 Happens to some people.
00:27:10 Happens to people.
00:27:12 They just have a single target sexuality.
00:27:15 You know?
00:27:16 I can't relate.
00:27:17 Because someone is so...
00:27:19 Imagine...
00:27:20 Okay.
00:27:21 Imagine, Nate,
00:27:22 like you've probably never met someone
00:27:25 who just seems absolutely perfect.
00:27:28 The closest thing that I've ever met
00:27:30 is this girl in college who was just super hot.
00:27:33 That's the closest I could get.
00:27:35 But imagine you met a girl who's so perfect,
00:27:39 like so insanely attuned to everything
00:27:43 you've ever thought or wanted,
00:27:45 that after meeting her, you think,
00:27:47 there's no way I can ever be happy with anyone else
00:27:51 because she's just that perfect.
00:27:53 Like, I've seen the top of the mountain.
00:27:56 How could I settle for sitting on the side of the mountain?
00:27:59 Okay, you know what?
00:28:00 When I find myself in a situation like that,
00:28:02 here's where my mind goes.
00:28:04 Okay, I know for a fact that nobody's perfect,
00:28:06 so what's wrong with me
00:28:08 that I think this person will complete me?
00:28:10 What do I need to fix about myself
00:28:12 that I need this addition in my life?
00:28:14 This is a good defense mechanism for that.
00:28:16 Yeah, I think so.
00:28:17 Because it's not a good position to be in
00:28:19 if they don't love you back.
00:28:20 No, it leaves you vulnerable, dude.
00:28:21 It leaves you vulnerable.
00:28:22 You can't be doing that.
00:28:23 Some people, like my brother, get lucky
00:28:26 and they eventually do love you back.
00:28:29 That's a rare thing, man.
00:28:30 It's a rare thing.
00:28:31 Yeah, it's a rare thing.
00:28:32 But you know, I get it.
00:28:34 Like, I get why if someone,
00:28:35 like if the only thing you find attractive
00:28:38 is like a red head with tits this size
00:28:43 and like everyone else you fuck is second best to that.
00:28:46 Like you fuck some girl who might be a 9 out of 10,
00:28:50 but is that going to distract you from the 10 out of 10?
00:28:53 You know, like you're always going to be thinking about the,
00:28:55 especially if it's within grasp,
00:28:57 because Jessica's kind of within grasp.
00:28:59 That's true.
00:29:00 Like, I'm sure in Morty's mind,
00:29:01 he thinks like she lives near me.
00:29:03 It's not like, it wouldn't be weird
00:29:05 if we got together, you know?
00:29:07 You know, I feel like it's a little bit
00:29:10 that they want to have their cake and eat it too,
00:29:13 that they want Morty to be woke as fuck
00:29:15 and you know, like this increasingly sociopathic guy,
00:29:19 you know, who's also gotten some morals and shit,
00:29:21 but then they also wanted to be like a naive kid
00:29:23 with like this innocent crush.
00:29:24 I think they want to have it both ways a little bit.
00:29:26 I think that's always been the case in this show.
00:29:28 Yeah.
00:29:29 Like, I think it's, it kind of bothered me in season two
00:29:33 when some episodes Morty was like this hard ass
00:29:36 and then other episodes he's a fucking retard.
00:29:38 Right, right.
00:29:39 And, I mean, that's always the problem
00:29:41 when you've got a bunch of writers in the show.
00:29:43 That's sort of the problem of like the archetype
00:29:45 of what, of the character that Morty is based on
00:29:47 versus like the character progression
00:29:49 throughout the show, you know?
00:29:50 Yeah.
00:29:51 And I think season three's done a much better job
00:29:53 of keeping him consistent.
00:29:54 I agree.
00:29:55 Like, he's, he's felt pretty consistently woke
00:29:57 throughout the season.
00:29:58 I haven't really felt like he was just a naive retard
00:30:02 much this time.
00:30:04 It's just the Jessica thing really,
00:30:05 I guess that stands out to me now.
00:30:07 I think that's why, that's why I think she's supposed
00:30:09 to be a major character.
00:30:10 Like, I think there's going to be some kind of development
00:30:12 in that relationship.
00:30:13 And that's why they want us to keep it in mind.
00:30:15 And if that's not the case, it will be weird.
00:30:17 Like, why bring her up so much
00:30:19 unless you're going to do something about it.
00:30:22 I agree.
00:30:23 I agree.
00:30:24 Because I don't remember her coming up that much
00:30:26 in season two.
00:30:27 She definitely did not.
00:30:28 The most that she ever did was like,
00:30:29 the most important Jessica has been before this season
00:30:31 was like that episode where he like made her fall in love
00:30:34 with him.
00:30:35 And then she, you know, was just mind controlled
00:30:36 to love him.
00:30:37 She was fairly relevant in season one.
00:30:39 Like, she's probably mentioned in more than half
00:30:42 the episodes of season one.
00:30:44 But season two, I don't remember her being a big deal.
00:30:46 But I haven't rewatched season two.
00:30:47 I've seen season one like four times.
00:30:48 So, I'm a bigger expert in that.
00:30:50 I forget.
00:30:51 Cronenberg is season two, right?
00:30:52 No, that's one.
00:30:53 Fuck.
00:30:54 Okay, I can't keep it.
00:30:55 That's like episode six.
00:30:56 That's where they killed the family
00:30:57 and moved to the other universe.
00:30:59 Okay, well whatever.
00:31:02 All right, well, good tangent.
00:31:04 See, that's the kind of quality you get under 60 minutes.
00:31:06 That's the good stuff.
00:31:07 Yeah.
00:31:08 An episode that neither of us had anything to say about
00:31:11 turned into one of the longest episodes of the podcast.
00:31:14 Is that true, really?
00:31:15 That's how we do.
00:31:16 Yeah, normally these are under 30 minutes.
00:31:18 Oh, that's cool.
00:31:19 There you go.
00:31:20 So, there you go.
00:31:21 Enjoy your various pills of wokeness and sleepiness.
00:31:25 And specifically that like, you know,
00:31:27 that shack like asleep and then woke with like the glowing
00:31:30 eyes.
00:31:31 Yeah, that's the one.
00:31:33 All right, I've had to piss for 25 minutes.
00:31:35 Okay, sounds good, my dude.
00:31:36 We'll see you guys next week with a new episode.
00:31:39 Bye-bye.
