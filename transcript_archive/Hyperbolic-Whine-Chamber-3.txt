00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another fantastic episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber. April
00:00:08 Fools, it's probably gonna be pathetic. Today, we are drinking Magner's Irish Pair Cider.
00:00:19 Imported since 1935. I don't know anything about this, but I just got it. Today's wine
00:00:27 has been funded by Michael Perrin at Crackkissie on Twitter. So if you want to go say thank you
00:00:36 for the wine, go to at K-R-A-K-I-S-S-I on Twitter. They're cool. They provided some money for the
00:00:47 wine fund and this was the first acquisition of that that fundage. I actually didn't even realize
00:00:53 this was there. I was digging through and just noticed it and I was like, oh, why did PayPal
00:00:59 not email me about this? You fucking bastards. Alright, so today we're going to be talking about
00:01:08 God and religion. Oh boy. I hesitated whether I wanted to talk about this, but I do. And I do
00:01:18 because I feel like I have a perspective that is at least I haven't seen voiced very often. And
00:01:27 because of that, I kind of wanted to give my two cents. Before we do that, I'm going to
00:01:32 get to take a first sip of the Pair Irish Cider and see how it is. Smells nice.
00:01:39 It's very, very sweet and barely tastes the alcohol at all.
00:01:52 Interesting. I actually kind of like this one.
00:01:57 Okay, so I don't want to even start this. Oh my God. So I guess maybe some background
00:02:05 would probably be appropriate to kind of explain where my current position is on like
00:02:10 God and stuff. So I was raised, I was raised Catholic, I was raised Roman Catholic.
00:02:16 I went to church every Sunday and every holy day from when I was,
00:02:22 assumingly from when I was born until I was 16 years old. And at least four of those 16 years,
00:02:30 I was being forced to church against my will because I was not a fan of it.
00:02:38 Roman Catholicism, at least a brand that was taught in this house,
00:02:43 never really appeared much, appealed much to me, I should say. It was always kind of like the doom
00:02:50 and gloom fire and brimstone. You're gonna burn in hell if you don't follow everything like completely
00:02:59 100% by the book, you know, the book. My mom, who was the super religious one in the house,
00:03:07 would consistently say when we were kids that she loved us but loved God more and things like that.
00:03:16 My big problem as a kid, I first started really not being into the whole God thing because when
00:03:22 I was a little kid, I never really considered it much. It was just something we did, you know,
00:03:25 I never kind of sat down and examined the spiritual and philosophical nuances of the Catholic doctrine.
00:03:32 I don't think much 8 to 10 year olds really do that. I just kind of, you know, went to Sunday
00:03:37 school, went to CCD, went to church, knelt, stood, bowed, whatever we were supposed to,
00:03:44 had a little way for thingy and then, but I got donuts after the fact. We always get donuts
00:03:49 after the church would provide them or we'd go down the street to dunks and get a big fucking
00:03:55 donut and then I'd be happy happy. The problem is that it's on a Sunday and that's 50% of my weekend
00:04:06 as a kid when you're going to school and I don't want to wake up, I want to sleep in late, you know,
00:04:11 because I've already got up early the day before because I gotta fucking watch Saturday morning
00:04:15 cartoons, you know, fucking Pokemon and Spider-Man and I'm gonna mute my computer. But I just found
00:04:23 church to be an annoyance is really where my initial disdain for going to Mass came from. I just,
00:04:29 I didn't want to go because I was too busy playing video games, I wanted to sleep in and it was just,
00:04:32 it was annoying. It was an hourth long thing and my mom's like a parish hopper, at least she was
00:04:38 back when I was going to church. So we would go to different parishes all the time. There was a
00:04:42 small window of time where we went to Mass in Latin, which was really weird. So the whole Mass
00:04:48 was in Latin. Nobody had any idea it was being said. We just listened to a priest and the priest,
00:04:54 I guess when this is like, super hardcore is when you have the Mass in Latin is the priest
00:04:59 isn't even allowed to look at you like he has to look at the tabernacle and tabernacles where like,
00:05:03 you know, the Eucharist, like the holy like the body, but the little way for things are. So
00:05:09 didn't even get the eye contact, he would be saying the Mass to Latin away from us,
00:05:13 you would see wouldn't hear him very well, which didn't really matter because he was speaking Latin.
00:05:18 That was like an hour away. The Mass was an hour and a half. So you're burning three hours there
00:05:23 an hour and an hour and a half there and an hour back. Near the tail end, we would go a couple
00:05:29 towns over. So it would be like a half an hour there. Mass then half an hour back and because
00:05:34 my mom was super religious, we'd have to say a rosary in the car on the way in and back. So it
00:05:40 was it was it was like two hours of like prayer. And and we just was me and my sister at the time.
00:05:50 We neither of us were into it. Just just we didn't either of us. We were annoyed by it. It wasn't
00:05:55 it wasn't really ever sit down like I have issues with the doctrine. I just didn't like it. And
00:06:00 eventually at 16, my father, who used to be religious, got out of it and kind of has like
00:06:07 his own sort of like kind of like weird personal kind of pseudo spirituality. I approached him
00:06:13 because I had to go get confirmed and confirmation is like when you become an adult in the church
00:06:17 or whatever and the Christian or at least a Catholic thing, but you have to stay at church
00:06:21 like overnight. You got to like go in, do a bunch of prayer stuff, a bunch of like Jesus
00:06:25 activities and you got to stay overnight and you do something the next day and then you're
00:06:28 confirmed. I'm just like, No, no, I can't I can't do a whole weekend of church. And the problem was
00:06:34 like, you have to this is what the confirmation was when I first started to really kind of think
00:06:42 about the doctrine itself. I didn't just sit there and go through the motions because like they made
00:06:45 a big deal out of the fact that like the priests and the people who were talking about confirmation
00:06:51 are still going to CCD and crap at the time. They made a big deal about how like, this is a big
00:06:58 deal in this faith, you know, if to be confirmed means like you're you believe in all of this,
00:07:03 this is something really important to you and you're kind of like making a contract with God
00:07:08 like with your soul and all that stuff. And and that was my first way to call like, wait a minute,
00:07:15 none of this jives with me. I'm just going through the motions I'm being told to, you know,
00:07:20 and and it was the first time I really realized that like faith was a choice because I didn't
00:07:25 have a choice in my house and have a choice to go to church. I had even though I'd expressed the
00:07:29 fact that I wasn't really interested in it. It was always like a firm no, like you have to go
00:07:34 like this is this is you have to do this, you know, and I don't really blame my mom for that
00:07:39 because if she she's knee deep in the whole thing. And so she was worried about my eternal soul.
00:07:44 So I don't blame her for being adamant about it. But then you'd go to the priest and the church
00:07:50 and stuff and they would tell you that like, this is your choice. And if you don't want to do it,
00:07:55 you shouldn't do it. So that's when I started to sit back and really like think about things like,
00:07:59 wait a minute, none of this really resonates with me, you know, I've never it's never been
00:08:06 something that like I've been gung ho about, like I know the rules, I know the ins and outs,
00:08:11 like I've been to CCD and I've been to mass, I know all the stuff to achieve, you know, at least
00:08:15 at a basic level. But I don't know if I really believe it, I can recite it, but I don't know
00:08:23 if it resonates with me. And now you want me to go through this like really big, like, ritual,
00:08:29 that's a huge deal in this faith. And literally, it's to confirm your belief. And I have no faith
00:08:36 to confirm. So it felt really wrong to me just from a moral standpoint. I didn't because like
00:08:43 none of these people in church that I knew and I knew a couple people of this one and the pastor
00:08:47 at this church who went to was actually a really nice guy. I just felt bad going up there lying
00:08:53 to him, because he was a good guy. And it was just like, I don't I don't feel like this is right.
00:08:58 So I approached my dad, because he was the only one I could talk to about this and be like, Dad,
00:09:03 I don't really want to do this. Like this is an overnight thing. And they're trying to
00:09:06 fucking confirm. And I don't I don't think I can confirm without lying, like, should I lie in a
00:09:13 space of God, like that seems that seems wrong, even by their rules, you know, like this, I don't know.
00:09:20 Long story short, there's a huge fucking fight between me, my mom, my dad. I eventually got out
00:09:24 of going to confirmation. Stop going to church at 16. Big riff between me and my mom for a while,
00:09:32 kind of at this point, we've patched up. She's really not even as religious as used to be anymore.
00:09:36 It used to be bad, like I couldn't read Harry Potter, because it was the devil, I couldn't play
00:09:40 Magic the Gathering, because that was the devil. So she would guilt me into giving up my cards that
00:09:45 I'd like saved up my allowance to buy. And my Harry Potter books disappeared. And I never got to
00:09:49 read past the prisoner of Azkaban. So happened to this day. Very, very religious. So I got out of
00:09:56 it. And then when I was when I was no longer like in it, I started really kind of reflecting on all
00:10:01 the things that they were talking about. And it's like, I don't really think this is true, you know,
00:10:05 and it really it affected me for a long time. You know, my first relationship, my first girlfriend
00:10:10 suffered because like, I always felt guilty about having sex and stuff, because like, you know,
00:10:13 in the Christian faith, like, no sex before marriage and all this things. And it took a while
00:10:19 to kind of like, let myself forgive myself for it. And even to this day, there's always like
00:10:25 thoughts of just like, you know, like, what if I'm going to burn in hell? Like, I've been a very
00:10:29 bad Catholic, you know, I think I've been a good person from kind of like a universal morality
00:10:34 kind of standpoint, but in terms of like following the Catholic doctrine, I'm way off the fucking
00:10:38 beaten path. But my history, I could go into more detail. But that's not really the point of this
00:10:44 podcast. I'm already like 10 minutes in, I've kind of just barely set the stage. I want to talk more
00:10:49 about not any specific faiths. I want to talk about like more like, like, not heady, but basic
00:10:57 concepts. God in general, right now, I'm not really a big fan of labels for anything. But if
00:11:05 you want it to kind of like understand my perspective in like a few words, I guess the best description
00:11:12 right now would be an agnostic atheist. I don't believe in a God. I don't think there is a God
00:11:18 just just based on just my observations. And I know that's the complete opposite of God like
00:11:22 God is faith. So God defies observation. But the problem with that for me is that everything else
00:11:31 in the entire world is based on science and observable phenomena. And the fact that there is
00:11:38 like this big ruling kind of energy and system in place in Judeo Christian faith, and then you
00:11:45 have to take it on faith, it just seems so convenient that there's a loophole for everything. And this
00:11:51 was really the first thing that I really honed in on with Catholicism, especially because I was
00:11:55 most familiar with it, that really rubbed me the wrong way, is that it was so interesting how the
00:12:01 faith had a way to skirt any sort of questions you would have. There was no arguing it. It was
00:12:08 always some sort of weird kind of sidestep, faint dodge to any questions you had, you know,
00:12:14 that he works in mysterious ways line. And at the same time, it was always interesting to me to
00:12:19 consider how archaic religions were kind of seen as a joke and nothing more than entertainment.
00:12:28 And it was always a bizarre concept to think of like, well, you know, we look at like the Egyptian
00:12:34 gods like Horus and the Greek gods like like Zeus and stuff and their characters, their fictional
00:12:40 characters, we they're the same thing as like, you know, Harry Potter, or, or like Luke Skywalker
00:12:47 stuff, they're their fictional characters that can be like repurposed and reinterpreted and
00:12:51 used in fiction all the time. But Jesus Christ isn't Muhammad isn't you know, these characters
00:12:58 these these characters aren't characters, they're historical figures and all this stuff is true.
00:13:04 And it always just felt really odd like why is this we're so sure that this is bullshit,
00:13:09 but this isn't bullshit, but they both have just as much like realistic viability. The only difference
00:13:14 is that one is accepted as spirituality, and one has long been rejected. So it's 2000 years from
00:13:20 now is Jesus going to be you know, parodied and like, you know, you're going to have like
00:13:26 fucking like a God of war video game and VR where you fight Jesus or something instead of like the
00:13:30 Greek gods, like, like who knows like, like, that's the whole thing. It just it just seems
00:13:35 the faith seems very convenient. And it always it feels like Catholicism and its kind of current
00:13:41 incarnation was developed back in medieval times to control people. And to siphon wealth off of
00:13:49 people, you know, like you have to live in poverty, because that's going to make you yours is the
00:13:53 kingdom of heaven, the meek shall inherit the earth and all that stuff. So give us all your money,
00:13:57 give your money to the church, give it to God, and by extension, give it to us the clergy,
00:14:02 and you live in an abject poverty, but that's a good thing. And you'll be rewarded when you die,
00:14:09 you know, but who fucking knows? Because once you're dead, it doesn't fucking matter anymore. It's
00:14:15 just it just seems really convenient, you know, like, how can you and people make these I don't
00:14:20 want to like get too bogged down this because again, I'm still just kind of setting the groundwork
00:14:23 of of the Vatican is a great example of like, almost the hypocrisy of the faith, you know,
00:14:28 like how can you have a city like the Vatican, but your tenants say you have to live in poverty.
00:14:32 And I know the current Pope is kind of like, in fact, I am aware of that hypocrisy. But it's
00:14:37 just like the whole thing just collapses upon inspection. The point I really wanted to make
00:14:43 with this, though, is that I'm not an atheist. I'm an agnostic atheist. And I wonder if there are
00:14:48 anybody listening or anybody in general, I'm sure there is, but like, I've never really talked to
00:14:53 anybody who kind of thinks about God the way I do. And so much that I'm not an aggressive atheist,
00:15:00 you know, you kind of go online and you and you and you look up atheism. And there are these people
00:15:05 just like, fuck God, God is bullshit. God is stupid. God is a terrible idea. And you're invisible
00:15:13 man in the sky. And if you believe in God, you're an idiot. Science is all that matters. God is
00:15:18 nothing but fairy tales. And you're a dumb ass. And the atheist community quote unquote, or just
00:15:25 atheism, the most vocal atheists are people like that. And then you know, I'm there's probably
00:15:31 the every man atheists who just like, Yeah, I don't really believe in that. And they kind of go on
00:15:34 with their day. The reason I use a term agnostic atheist is because I don't think there's a God,
00:15:42 but I can't prove it. There's just as much proof that there isn't God, that there is God.
00:15:50 Because that's the whole thing that's kind of going back to the loophole thing I was talking
00:15:53 about God by definition is unprovable. So any any sort of tangible evidence we can have that would
00:16:00 prove God would just be dismissed by the religious as not God. It's like, Oh, we found we we figured
00:16:09 out the the existence like the the the existence of the the big bag we proved it we have proof.
00:16:15 And like this is what it is. And like this is what God was. And then just like but that's not God,
00:16:20 you know, like even even the fact that like someone could like, God could come down to earth,
00:16:28 have a physical embodiment, and not be any of the faiths that we've ever had, like, you know,
00:16:34 like, because who the fuck do we know what God is, if God is like this big immortal thing.
00:16:37 But let's say, let's say God is real, and God comes down to earth in a physical body,
00:16:43 and says, I'm God, I'm going to do all this crazy shit. And yeah, I'm God, like now you know,
00:16:49 you know, all you people been asking for proof of God, here I am. I think the atheists would still
00:16:54 be like, fuck you, you're not really God, you're just an imposter. And then the religious would be
00:16:58 like, no, God is this God is God is our faith. And then whatever you are, you're not true, you're
00:17:03 like, you're like the devil trying to trying to trick us, or, or you're not God, you're something
00:17:08 else, you know, by the fact that you're here physically, disproves that you're God, you know,
00:17:12 even I think the super religious who believe in things like the rapture, and like the second
00:17:16 coming itself, I think of the second coming actually happened, they probably wouldn't believe it was
00:17:20 the second coming, kind of got sidetracked. But that was a point I did want to make. My perspective
00:17:26 is that I'm an atheist under duress. And what I mean by that is that I don't hate God. I actually
00:17:35 would prefer if there was a God, I just can't find any reason in my heart of hearts to truly
00:17:44 believe that I would I because because if there is a God, everything has a purpose. I have a purpose.
00:17:50 My pain has a purpose. My suffering has a purpose. The suffering I see around me has a
00:17:55 everything is happening for a reason. Everything that's chaos instantly becomes order.
00:18:02 Everything is going completely according to plan. Nothing is wrong. Everything that's happening is
00:18:08 just this huge big like supernatural chess game that my tiny little mortal head can't understand.
00:18:15 But everything's fine. So I don't have to worry about it anymore. I just got to do me to the best
00:18:19 I can and know that I'm being guided subconsciously by a divine entity that's going to lead me to
00:18:25 exactly the right place I need to go. That would be great. I would prefer that even if it would kind
00:18:31 of give up a bit of my autonomy almost, but the the idea that everything's good, that everything's
00:18:37 fine, that there's nothing wrong. I find that very appealing. I would love there to be. I'm
00:18:46 envious of people who have faith because they must be so much more sound of mind, so much more calm,
00:18:53 so much more collected because they believe, truly believe that there's a guy up there making
00:19:00 sure everything's okay. I would love that. But to go back to what I said about how faith seems so
00:19:06 convenient and how all these old dead faiths are just jokes now and that everything that
00:19:13 throughout human history that was once attributed to God has been shown to be a natural understandable
00:19:18 phenomenon. It just, I can't believe because it seems ridiculous given the circumstances
00:19:25 to continue to have belief. I would love to, but God itself, religion as a concept seems like
00:19:31 a desperate ploy by humanity to have something bigger, to have that control. I think everybody
00:19:38 wants what I just described to know that everything's okay. The difference between
00:19:42 the religious and myself is that they can find a way to buy into it. And as much as I want to buy
00:19:49 into it, I can't. So I'm an atheist under duress. I don't want to be an atheist. I just have no choice.
00:19:59 I don't know if other people feel like that. I don't know. I've never talked to anybody about
00:20:03 faith really all that much, but like even just in casual conversation, all the atheists are always
00:20:07 just like, fuck God. And I just, I can't get mad at religious people. Like they do some stupid
00:20:14 shit sometimes when they bring their, their, their faith into like politics and into like,
00:20:19 you know, people's lifestyle and shit like that. But just like when they're doing their own thing,
00:20:23 go for it. Like you're definitely more mentally healthy than I am. I'm on antidepressants seeing
00:20:28 a therapist suicidal because my life's falling apart. And I don't think I can't bring myself to
00:20:33 believe that there's any greater purpose than just some crazy bullshit genetic fucking cocktail
00:20:41 random chance fucking destroyed doomed universe around us. And there's nothing to live for. And
00:20:47 I have to build my own fucking destiny and my own fucking purpose with my own bare hands.
00:20:54 And every day I don't do it, just another day closer to my own death when I turn into nothing.
00:20:58 And that's it. The universe is big and vast. And I am pointless and have no purpose. And I
00:21:06 just have to sit here and try and forge my own purpose in this tiny little speck of existence
00:21:10 I have before I'm dead and everything is forgotten and no longer exists. There's no afterlife.
00:21:15 This is all I have. And right now it's really shitty. That's terrifying. I would love to have
00:21:22 the comfort of faith. I'm envious of people who have the comfort of faith, but I can't do it.
00:21:28 I don't know if I even want to, if I could, because I'm so kind of, I don't want to say logically,
00:21:34 but just like observationally grounded. But I can see the appeal. I can understand the appeal.
00:21:40 I'm envious of the appeal. So that's my thing on God. That was the big point I wanted to make.
00:21:46 This is a very ranty video. I would love to believe in God. Because I think there would be this kind
00:21:52 of like a placebo effect. There would be a placebo effect of if I was truly confident
00:21:59 that I was being guided by God or I had God on my side and that everything was happening for a
00:22:03 reason, I would probably self actualize better than I do now. Because the stresses and the
00:22:11 depression and the anxiety that I have right now would be at least partially lifted because of that
00:22:17 faith. So even if there was no God, just the belief in it would probably allow me to function on a
00:22:21 higher level than I am right now. Because my mind would be less burdened with all these heavy,
00:22:27 fucking crazy, deep philosophical ideas and the horribly bleak outlooks that my scientific
00:22:35 based perspective leads to with those questions. I don't know. That's really all I got. I kind
00:22:40 of want to talk about this for a while. Not exactly the most welds put together podcast,
00:22:45 very rambly. But there you go. Wanted to find about God? Wanted about God? Let me know in the
00:22:53 comments if you hated it. I'm Tommy Oliver. Thanks again to Michael for the wine. It was actually
00:23:01 a good choice. I like it. So if you want something really sweet that barely tastes like alcohol,
00:23:07 Magner's Irish Parasiter. Not a bad choice. Take it easy, guys.
