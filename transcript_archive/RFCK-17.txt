00:00:00 Routing, fuckers, cop, killers, inn, Kurgostarworth, the complete saga.
00:00:10 Do you guys want to move so Kazzy's like in frame?
00:00:14 No, I gotta be in frame still.
00:00:16 Can we make Kazzy a frame, please?
00:00:20 A frame, what?
00:00:22 Can we make Kazzy a frame?
00:00:24 Yeah, sure, you know what? Kazzy's the new a frame.
00:00:26 Congratulations, other new a frame.
00:00:28 I wish my beard were darker.
00:00:30 I'm not sorry.
00:00:32 It blends in and it makes it like a Hitler stash because this part is not thin enough.
00:00:38 Did anything happen? Did you get a haircut or something? Did you change something about the way that you look?
00:00:44 Are you Roman?
00:00:46 You can sort of look like a god.
00:00:48 You look like you're about to star in a pornography film.
00:00:56 Painous.
00:00:58 I didn't even know.
00:01:00 I thought when you pressed your core we were going to have a little bit more time, I don't know, fuck around.
00:01:04 Whatever, start going.
00:01:06 The game's open, right? The game's open, click that fucking game.
00:01:08 It's not open, actually.
00:01:10 Click open, click open.
00:01:12 It's on the other screen, and here we go.
00:01:14 Hey, give me this shit.
00:01:16 It's mine, it's mine.
00:01:18 Oh.
00:01:20 People have been fucking clamoring for this game ever since we unveiled it at the last rfckcon.
00:01:26 People have just been like, where's the LEGO Star Wars episode?
00:01:28 Where's LEGO Star Wars complete saga for the Wii or the 360?
00:01:32 Or where's my pee?
00:01:34 It's gone all ways.
00:01:36 It's all over the dang place. It's all over my fucking bathroom.
00:01:38 Oh, yeah.
00:01:40 Pee on a keto strip like a normal person.
00:01:42 I pissed all over Ben's room and it was an accident, and then I thought, wow.
00:01:46 I should do this on purpose next time.
00:01:48 Next time?
00:01:50 Yes.
00:01:52 So we're finally delivering it to the people.
00:01:54 This is the best game ever made.
00:01:56 Ben, I know that we've had our differences.
00:01:58 You had a track record of loving shit.
00:02:00 Ben, we've had our differences before.
00:02:02 We've come to different conclusions about classic video games.
00:02:04 For instance, for some reason, maybe you were in a cranky mood that day,
00:02:08 but you just didn't like losing.
00:02:10 You didn't like XT Gale of Darkness for some reason.
00:02:12 You woke up on a bad note that day.
00:02:14 All 175 days that we recorded it.
00:02:16 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:02:18 It was just bad luck.
00:02:20 I think we're going to bring this one around.
00:02:22 Because listen, you could take Super Smash Brothers Brawl,
00:02:26 you could take Pop Tropica,
00:02:28 you could take Pokemon XT Gale of Darkness,
00:02:30 and you could roll them all into one, into one contiguous ball,
00:02:32 drop it into a pot, boil it into like a nice broth,
00:02:34 and then add noodles to it.
00:02:36 Reduce it down into a syrup, maybe?
00:02:38 Reduce it down into a syrup, drain it into your fucking eyeballs,
00:02:40 or through your nose, and you wouldn't get half the hype.
00:02:42 You wouldn't get half the hype that you get when you play this fucking game.
00:02:46 Lego Star Wars Complete Psycho.
00:02:48 Or as I like to call it, cool wokely lead,
00:02:50 here in the hood, we call it, curgo stirrer work.
00:02:52 Okay, introduce your game.
00:02:54 Uh, you know.
00:02:56 I'm the ratty fucker, and this is the cop killer.
00:02:58 Woo!
00:03:00 Alright, alright, now we can see.
00:03:02 We have the juvie kingpin, Tommy Oliver.
00:03:04 Yeah, that's me.
00:03:06 And the other juvie kingpin.
00:03:08 It's me, Tom Oliver.
00:03:10 We have a loud juice.
00:03:12 We've allowed juice to enter the sanctum.
00:03:14 And to the juice.
00:03:16 Much to our great chagrin.
00:03:18 You know, cop killer sounds really gone downhill, you know?
00:03:20 Boy, boy howdy.
00:03:22 Uh,
00:03:24 Where's up here in Ascertain Heights?
00:03:26 We're just fucking trying to have a good time,
00:03:28 and these juves are coming around,
00:03:30 asking for directions to the fucking Arson Brook farm,
00:03:32 like, oh.
00:03:34 Hey, where's the farm, guys?
00:03:36 Hey, where's the mill?
00:03:38 I've been looking forward to getting some daughter apples.
00:03:40 I just can't wait to saturate my slimeoid.
00:03:42 Oh, yeah, fuck off.
00:03:44 No salt on my razor nuts, please.
00:03:46 Jesus Christ.
00:03:48 See, Ben, look at this.
00:03:50 It's Legos, and it's Star Wars.
00:03:52 How big can you get? How big can you get?
00:03:54 How well can you grow?
00:03:56 It's pretty big.
00:03:58 You're growing so fast right now, Ben.
00:04:00 It's pretty big. Do you want to, like,
00:04:02 do you want to leave the door open?
00:04:04 Why?
00:04:06 I'd probably be really loud that way.
00:04:08 Yeah? I think the louder we are, the better.
00:04:10 Yeah, you don't have to do anything serious.
00:04:12 We respect people's boundaries.
00:04:14 Hey, oh my god, it's the sun god, Apollo.
00:04:16 He's canonical.
00:04:18 He's talking about his cop killers now.
00:04:20 Are you recording?
00:04:22 Oh, yeah, dude.
00:04:24 Let me ask you a question.
00:04:26 Who out here?
00:04:28 We ain't fucking playing.
00:04:30 What is Star Wars the complete saga, dude?
00:04:32 The best game ever made.
00:04:34 Listen, listen, man.
00:04:36 Everyone's going to make fun of Legos.
00:04:38 Star Wars the complete saga coming here.
00:04:40 So, oh, what's this baby game?
00:04:42 Literally for 12-year-olds.
00:04:44 Literally for 8-year-olds.
00:04:46 Literally for 10-year-olds.
00:04:48 For the whole family, and for baby.
00:04:50 Listen, all I'm trying to say is that fun family fun
00:04:52 doesn't mean they have to be not fun.
00:04:54 So we're going to get in here with Qui-Gonjin and Obi-Wan Kenobi,
00:04:56 the two best characters ever made in fiction.
00:04:58 And we're going to hup the fuck around.
00:05:00 Fuck you, Ben.
00:05:02 Slime Fest 5.
00:05:04 Slime Fest 5.
00:05:06 Slime Fest 5. Over.
00:05:08 Delete his slime.
00:05:10 You just got shot. How do I kill you?
00:05:12 No, you can't do it, dude. Don't worry.
00:05:14 Don't worry, dude. You can't do it.
00:05:16 Slime Fest 6. Slime Fest 6.
00:05:18 Slime Fest 6.
00:05:20 This is why Legos Star Wars is the best.
00:05:22 Star Wars sucks. Star Wars is awful.
00:05:24 If you like Star Wars, you're stupid.
00:05:26 But you should probably kill yourself.
00:05:28 Yes! Slime Fest 6 is over. Take a slime.
00:05:30 But Legos are sick.
00:05:32 And that makes it okay.
00:05:34 Legos are so zoom-er-core, they're customizable.
00:05:36 They're all about conversation.
00:05:38 They're all about the internet integration.
00:05:40 Dude, you go and you open up fuck...
00:05:42 Okay, literally give me a hashtag
00:05:44 fucking like hard-resonant chat if you know what I'm talking about right now.
00:05:46 You go your mom's work because it's signature child of the work day.
00:05:48 Then you boot up one of the powerful ass computers there at her work.
00:05:50 Fucking Lego 3D builder,
00:05:52 that application that you can get from the Lego site.
00:05:54 And you start making 3D Lego models inside of your computer.
00:05:56 And you're like, what the fuck?
00:05:58 Are you as powerful as the Lego site? What the hell?
00:06:00 Are we supposed to kill all those people?
00:06:02 No, this isn't even level.
00:06:04 This is the hub world, my friend.
00:06:06 Dude, we're going to defend this.
00:06:08 Okay, name one...
00:06:10 Name a better movie than the Phantom Menace.
00:06:12 Like right now, like I'm begging you.
00:06:14 Indiana Jones, The Crystal Skull.
00:06:16 How about The Last Jedi?
00:06:18 Oh, you know what? You're right.
00:06:20 You didn't think they could improve perfection, but somehow they found a way.
00:06:22 Alright, we're gonna get right into this.
00:06:24 Okay, alright. This cutscene
00:06:26 is like the most iconic thing.
00:06:28 You know, Rosebud.
00:06:30 That's baby shit. That's some fucking
00:06:32 chocolate toy fucking...
00:06:34 for a baby's first story.
00:06:36 Baby's first narrative.
00:06:38 The baby's first story?
00:06:40 Here's for some real actual plot.
00:06:42 Here's the plot. Here's the plot of Gilgamesh.
00:06:44 Two.
00:06:46 This is Gilgamesh two right here.
00:06:48 All the chicks, dude.
00:06:50 Yeah, get ready for this.
00:06:52 Anki-Doo. Anki-Doo.
00:06:54 That's my favorite.
00:06:56 Oh, this is Gilgamesh right here. He's so big and chunky.
00:06:58 Oh, he's chunky already.
00:07:00 Dude, Ben, do you remember when we went
00:07:02 to the Trade Federation and they tried to kill us?
00:07:04 I remember that
00:07:06 there was a lot of slime
00:07:08 coin on the line.
00:07:10 And they were
00:07:12 showing for it.
00:07:14 Their eyes? Oh, they're gone.
00:07:16 Oh, they're gone. But you think it's sad? No, it's actually funny and a joke.
00:07:18 Look, oh, they fall down.
00:07:20 They break the pieces like a Lego.
00:07:22 No, we're scared. Now we're on fault.
00:07:24 That's too sad. I can't.
00:07:26 Ben, I'm not to introduce you to something.
00:07:28 What are the friendly characters and why?
00:07:30 You're a friendly character.
00:07:32 We have to do it at the same time.
00:07:34 All right, Ben, I'm not to introduce you into...
00:07:36 We'll assume we're the band of your existence.
00:07:38 Why can't I joke?
00:07:40 These miscolored
00:07:42 slime coin right here, these physical copies,
00:07:44 like these like millennium, like challenge coin
00:07:46 slime coins. These are called studs.
00:07:48 Is that bar that fills up?
00:07:50 Yeah. There's a state.
00:07:52 There's a game state called true Jedi.
00:07:54 When you get enough studs, then you get true Jedi.
00:07:56 That's part of getting 100%.
00:07:58 We're getting true Jedi every single level, Ben.
00:08:00 So that means that we're going to be
00:08:02 scouring each level for
00:08:04 literal hours trying to find
00:08:06 every studs available. We're not going to have to solve riddles.
00:08:08 We're going to have to solve the Spinks' riddles 3
00:08:10 in order to get the studs. What are you doing?
00:08:12 Why are you doing this?
00:08:14 They're dancing and we get studs for it.
00:08:16 We get money. We get fucking cold, hard catch.
00:08:18 Listen, I...
00:08:20 When I was a kid, I was a communist.
00:08:22 And then I played this game and I thought, wow, what a fucking dumb ass I was.
00:08:24 Time to get fucking rich
00:08:26 and banked in new communism.
00:08:28 A.K.A. Kirgo Sturrward.
00:08:30 The complete surger.
00:08:32 Okay, so is this the game just like running around
00:08:34 and using the force on things to make studs pop out of them?
00:08:36 Yeah, but we also... Yes, yes.
00:08:38 All right, well, we're winning.
00:08:40 I think we're winning, Munchy. I think we're doing it.
00:08:42 So I want to let you understand,
00:08:44 just so you know, it means you have no frame of reference.
00:08:46 It's a normal game, like, you know, like the game
00:08:48 that you play, like, to, like, win the game.
00:08:50 Uh-huh.
00:08:52 Like, it's almost like a beat-em-up almost.
00:08:54 You got an attack and you fight enemies,
00:08:56 you just progress through the level, there's puzzles and shit,
00:08:58 you know, it's like a normal, like, 3D platform or whatever.
00:09:00 But the meta game, the real game,
00:09:02 is getting as many studs as you...
00:09:04 A BLUE ONE! A BLUE ONE!
00:09:06 I'm crushing you in studs right now.
00:09:08 Yeah, that's fun.
00:09:10 I used to watch my brother play this game
00:09:12 and when he didn't get the blue stud, I'd be like,
00:09:14 I'm like, I'm fucking in $100.
00:09:16 Dude, okay, you know that feel
00:09:18 when you come across the purple stud
00:09:20 and you just literally have to change
00:09:22 your fucking pants.
00:09:24 Wait, there's a purple stud?
00:09:26 Wait, when? The legendary, the mythical.
00:09:28 Is that in a different one?
00:09:30 Okay, this game is teaching some crazy fucking moral
00:09:32 because only the Sith can get purple studs.
00:09:34 I don't remember the purple stud.
00:09:36 It's because they have, like, 10,000 each.
00:09:38 That's a purple stud.
00:09:40 Is that why I don't remember it? Yeah.
00:09:42 That's a lot of studs.
00:09:44 We're already halfway to true Jedi.
00:09:46 This game is literally free money.
00:09:48 You play this and you get paid.
00:09:50 It's free money, the game.
00:09:52 No, I love this shit because you just knock it.
00:09:54 Like, if you knock your sword...
00:09:56 MEDICATE!
00:09:58 Stop, stop, stop, stop.
00:10:00 Wait, we're gonna die.
00:10:02 Kill these guys.
00:10:04 Kill these so we can have
00:10:06 a quiet space for me to do
00:10:08 the most important thing I've ever done in my entire life.
00:10:10 Owls back there?
00:10:12 We gotta go back, we gotta go back
00:10:14 after I...
00:10:16 Guys, please, a moment of silence.
00:10:18 Come back over here, Ben.
00:10:20 A moment of silence for the best video game sound effect
00:10:22 of all time.
00:10:24 BUSH A WING!
00:10:26 BUSH A WING!
00:10:28 That's a mini-kit.
00:10:30 10 in each level. Get them all 100%.
00:10:32 I used to play this game
00:10:34 literally, religiously, more than I went to church.
00:10:36 And you know what? I became more moral
00:10:38 because of it. I understand the concept of justice.
00:10:40 For all the times that I was robbed of my mini-kit,
00:10:42 I learned the value of courage and justice.
00:10:44 You have not explained what a mini-kit is.
00:10:46 A mini-kit with the concept of what I just got.
00:10:48 It is a tiny little, it's like a little box.
00:10:50 It's a little like, like, cylinder thing.
00:10:52 I mean, I saw what it looks like.
00:10:54 Well, then you get it. I'm okay.
00:10:56 Do I? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh my god!
00:10:58 I'm gonna cry right now.
00:11:00 Okay, okay, now you...
00:11:02 Ben, do you want the honors? Do you want the honors, Ben?
00:11:04 I would love to. Thank you, my friend. Die.
00:11:06 Ha ha!
00:11:08 Alright, no, wait, no, we need that whore.
00:11:10 God damn it! You balled the door to his whore!
00:11:12 He was too... Oh, he's back, he's back.
00:11:14 Alright, don't worry. Okay, T9-
00:11:16 109-111-3000. Alright, we're gonna come over here
00:11:18 and we're gonna fuck some fucking whores.
00:11:20 Are you ready? Let's go to the whorehouse.
00:11:22 Go to the brothel.
00:11:24 He walks funny. I don't like the cut of his gym.
00:11:26 No, listen, okay.
00:11:28 You may have thought of yourself, wow, mindless.
00:11:30 Let's give a third eye on his body.
00:11:32 That's just the way he likes to roll, dude.
00:11:34 No, you...
00:11:36 I used the force on him and I turned him and...
00:11:38 Well, he's glowing, it's so tempting.
00:11:40 Well, wait, who's short-haired white man and who's...
00:11:42 I'm long-haired white man.
00:11:44 I'm Mr. Silver right now.
00:11:46 You're Mr. Silver?
00:11:48 Yeah, I am Mr. Silver.
00:11:50 Look at the top right, okay. Why would you do that?
00:11:52 I'll tell you right, Ben. You may have thought this game was brainless.
00:11:54 In fact, it is the epitome of puzzles.
00:11:56 It is literally more puzzles
00:11:58 than any other thing in existence.
00:12:00 Look at this, collectibles, studs.
00:12:02 You have to use your brain to unlock secrets.
00:12:04 Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
00:12:06 Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
00:12:08 Capitalism.
00:12:10 This is literally like, better teaching you capitalism
00:12:12 than the society in which we live.
00:12:14 All right.
00:12:16 Ben's more studded.
00:12:18 Oh, it's gonna pick you up.
00:12:20 Ben's more studded.
00:12:22 He's better than studded.
00:12:24 All right.
00:12:26 Oh, no, we have to work together,
00:12:28 but we have to work together, okay, okay.
00:12:30 Use the force, use the force.
00:12:32 I'm using it.
00:12:33 No, you aren't.
00:12:34 You aren't doing it correctly.
00:12:35 Oh, there we go.
00:12:37 Spit out the stuff.
00:12:38 No, no, no, don't worry, it's going to lift me up.
00:12:41 And now, don't push us!
00:12:42 True Jedi!
00:12:44 Oh my god!
00:12:46 What does it mean?
00:12:47 True Jedi!
00:12:48 What does it mean?
00:12:49 That means we're true Jedi, true Jedi, pure of heart men,
00:12:52 pure of heart!
00:12:53 Do we have super powers now?
00:12:54 We can beat the level now.
00:12:55 Yeah.
00:12:56 Is that all it means?
00:12:57 Yeah, OK, OK.
00:12:57 All right, now check out this mini kit.
00:12:58 All right, you need to work together with me.
00:12:59 We need to put aside our differences.
00:13:00 Our mental and racial differences.
00:13:02 You know, I crossed the border begging for money
00:13:04 and you supplied like a dumbass.
00:13:06 Now it's time to mend all of our wounds.
00:13:07 Put down the hatchet.
00:13:09 We're going to bury the hatchet in this droid's fucking skull.
00:13:11 Oh no, he shot me, dude.
00:13:12 He shot me, I'm down.
00:13:13 When you die, your studs all pop out
00:13:15 and you can lose true Jedi.
00:13:16 So we have to make sure we don't loot that shit happen.
00:13:18 Now let's fucking run through like men in black
00:13:20 or like the other men which aren't black.
00:13:21 Sorry if you're racist.
00:13:24 Are we over yet?
00:13:25 No, no, over here.
00:13:26 Can we beat the game?
00:13:27 No, no, we're sprinting.
00:13:28 We're sprinting.
00:13:29 Can we, can we be done?
00:13:30 Can we be done with it?
00:13:32 Dude, you fucked up, dude.
00:13:33 Okay.
00:13:34 We got a purple.
00:13:35 All right, this right here, this is only bounty hunters.
00:13:37 Oh, this is only to R2-D2.
00:13:38 We have to come here when we're doing free play.
00:13:40 Once we unlock R2-D2 and such R4,
00:13:42 we're going to have to go back here
00:13:43 and we're going to have to unlock here this zone
00:13:44 so we can get a mini-kit that's inside here.
00:13:45 We're probably at the red power brick.
00:13:47 Red power brick, there are three collectibles.
00:13:49 There are the studs where you use true Jedi or mini-kit.
00:13:51 So there are 10 of them in each levels.
00:13:52 There's also the red power bricks
00:13:53 and once there's one each level
00:13:54 and then they're locked here, the extras.
00:13:55 Dude, I got power up.
00:13:56 Dude, pick up power.
00:13:57 You got power up, you got purple.
00:13:58 Dude, you're killer, you're killer.
00:14:00 I'm Mace Windu.
00:14:01 I'm going to be like that.
00:14:02 I'm just putting you out of your room.
00:14:05 Tom, this game's so good, confirm.
00:14:06 There's Jar Jar.
00:14:07 Where is Jar Jar?
00:14:08 No, no, no, no.
00:14:09 There's Jar Jar.
00:14:10 Don't worry, best game.
00:14:11 Oh, look, fuck Jar Jar.
00:14:13 Don't worry.
00:14:13 Dude, don't worry.
00:14:15 Because she's the cause me daddy Tusa
00:14:18 and we're going to be able to meet with her real soon.
00:14:21 Fuck yeah, all right.
00:14:22 Now I'm invested.
00:14:23 All right, now we have to build.
00:14:24 Remember, Lego bricks, remember 9-Eleven.
00:14:26 We're coming right back real soon.
00:14:28 Oh my God, I'm floated.
00:14:31 Dude, literally.
00:14:33 Somehow you're ahead of me.
00:14:33 It makes me mad.
00:14:35 You're younger and richer than me.
00:14:38 And now this is me.
00:14:39 My two favorite things to be.
00:14:44 Ah!
00:14:46 Fuck him up.
00:14:47 Dude, don't worry, we fucked him right up.
00:14:48 Okay, look at this.
00:14:49 Whoa.
00:14:50 Oh, you fucked up.
00:14:51 You fucked it up for me.
00:14:55 You're gonna get those hybrids.
00:14:56 When does the game end?
00:14:57 There's no part of it.
00:14:58 There's no game here that isn't just collecting the studs.
00:15:02 The studs are the game.
00:15:03 Apparently.
00:15:05 So why?
00:15:07 They make a nice noise when you collect them.
00:15:09 I don't think I like being a true Jedi.
00:15:11 Now I have expectations I have to live up to.
00:15:13 No, don't worry.
00:15:14 You'll never be able to live up to the true Jedi.
00:15:16 Okay, put that thing, Ben.
00:15:18 We're gonna set some ground rules in this version,
00:15:19 but it's gonna work.
00:15:20 You're gonna need to assist me.
00:15:21 Why do my back flips?
00:15:22 Why do my parkour?
00:15:23 You're gonna need to assist me.
00:15:24 Or else I'm gonna fuck you up.
00:15:25 Or else I'm gonna beat you.
00:15:26 This is the basis of good relationship.
00:15:27 Don't want me to use the force or what.
00:15:29 Don't want to use the force or what.
00:15:30 Okay.
00:15:31 No, okay, didn't work.
00:15:32 It didn't work.
00:15:32 Nice job.
00:15:33 Nice job, asshole.
00:15:34 No, wait.
00:15:35 Okay, and you know what?
00:15:36 You're right.
00:15:36 Never mind.
00:15:37 Bye.
00:15:37 Dude.
00:15:38 Ah!
00:15:40 Oh, you got a power.
00:15:40 If you're a pig now.
00:15:41 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:15:41 I have to destroy the Jets.
00:15:43 Dude, the destroyers.
00:15:45 Oh, they roll.
00:15:46 Just like in the film.
00:15:47 Are you not putting a filter on the game?
00:15:49 No, why not?
00:15:49 No, they're just not filter on the game.
00:15:51 Are you disappointed?
00:15:52 Yeah.
00:15:53 Can I disappoint you?
00:15:53 I'm pretty disappointed in you.
00:15:55 No, listen.
00:15:56 Listen, this game is so good, you eat it twice.
00:16:01 This same game.
00:16:02 End of game.
00:16:02 This game's so good, you'll be nice.
00:16:04 Game over, please.
00:16:05 Game over, please.
00:16:07 This game's so nice, you don't make fun of it in class.
00:16:09 You ever notice that Tom and Ben are like the same?
00:16:11 Yeah, they are.
00:16:12 Feeny, beard, other.
00:16:14 Yeah.
00:16:15 That's our character.
00:16:16 No life, no skill, no game, no life.
00:16:19 That's a good one.
00:16:20 Oh, look at this guy.
00:16:22 Can I beat him?
00:16:23 You can't beat the biome.
00:16:24 You can do whatever you want.
00:16:25 This is like a Star Wars.
00:16:26 That's a little bit of an imagination to the audience.
00:16:29 Why can't I build?
00:16:30 Why can't I build new friends?
00:16:32 You can.
00:16:32 You can build.
00:16:33 You haven't been as good as it.
00:16:35 You haven't been as good as me, so you
00:16:36 don't know how to build things.
00:16:37 Look, they have the confirmed child labor in Star Wars.
00:16:40 Why'd you break it?
00:16:41 Because I fucking hate you, babe.
00:16:43 Why'd you break the conveyor belt?
00:16:44 It was moving.
00:16:45 They were going to the over here.
00:16:47 Listen, we're rich enough.
00:16:48 We don't need anymore.
00:16:49 I've said no millionaire ever.
00:16:51 Mm-hmm.
00:16:53 Let's just use the force on these things.
00:16:55 Then we're going to get through.
00:16:56 That's what I'm doing.
00:16:56 That's exactly what I'm doing.
00:16:57 Jump through?
00:16:58 Oh my god.
00:16:59 Hold on.
00:16:59 Oh, it's definitely in a parkour.
00:17:00 He's not smart enough to do that.
00:17:01 Oh, this is one of those puzzles, right?
00:17:03 Yeah, yeah.
00:17:03 I've heard about these.
00:17:05 Bailey, this avenue is a secret former route.
00:17:08 How do you think, Amber?
00:17:09 So that's in my server?
00:17:11 Yeah, in your own server.
00:17:12 Don't you fucking touch my server.
00:17:14 That's my safe space, and you invaded it.
00:17:19 That's classic abuser tactics.
00:17:21 Classic.
00:17:22 Oh my god, this game is going to make me cry, dude.
00:17:25 OK, all right, the blue stuff.
00:17:27 OK, all right, Ben.
00:17:28 By making me play the LEGO Star Wars.
00:17:29 Ben, turn into the whore, and then make the whore button go.
00:17:34 Hey, I did it.
00:17:37 Oh yeah, in the lead.
00:17:37 Oh, blue stuff.
00:17:38 No, no, activate the button.
00:17:39 Activate the button.
00:17:40 What?
00:17:41 Activate the button.
00:17:42 Oh, did I do it?
00:17:43 Did I do it or what?
00:17:43 Ben, Ben, I'm rich, climax.
00:17:47 Gross.
00:17:48 So you come, man.
00:17:50 Yeah, dude, look at this.
00:17:51 You need to come.
00:17:51 Oh.
00:17:52 Hey, anyone need to come?
00:17:53 Anyone need to come?
00:17:54 Yeah, yeah, can you pick me up sometime?
00:17:55 Yeah, there you go.
00:17:57 Hey, can you pick me up?
00:17:58 Come from the store, please.
00:17:59 Can you pick me up a Cummys?
00:18:00 Dude, free play unlocked.
00:18:01 We got one gold brick for that.
00:18:03 And guess what?
00:18:03 We got true Jedi, and the unlock of these characters.
00:18:05 We're going to get way more red bricks.
00:18:07 I don't understand, Munchie.
00:18:08 We unlocked true Jedi.
00:18:09 We unlocked a gold brick, but I still
00:18:10 feel unfulfilled in my life.
00:18:12 Oh, no, we're going to reach a million other true Jedi's.
00:18:14 Don't you fucking worry for this stud total.
00:18:16 Our stud total is going to reach the high heavens, bro.
00:18:19 Look at this, look at this.
00:18:21 All right, good time, good time.
00:18:26 Do you know, maybe this game eats so bad.
00:18:27 When we get make-up, we build LEGO sets.
00:18:29 And when we reach, ultimately, we reach a whole set.
00:18:32 Level complete.
00:18:33 True Jedi.
00:18:35 Jesus Christ, Jesus.
00:18:37 Ben, knock it off.
00:18:38 No.
00:18:39 Knock it off.
00:18:39 That's my character.
00:18:40 Knock it off.
00:18:41 That's what separates me from Tom.
00:18:42 How would you know the difference if I wasn't vaping?
00:18:44 Knock it off.
00:18:45 Yes, he had to vaping.
00:18:46 He had to suppress and suicide.
00:18:49 He was an absentee fove.
00:18:53 Hey, autosave.
00:18:55 Hell yeah, dude.
00:18:56 Fuck yeah.
00:18:57 Dude, this game has autosave.
00:18:59 Fuck yeah.
00:18:59 Well, this is for the future.
00:19:01 Yeah, this is a little bit of a wrap-up.
00:19:02 Yeah.
00:19:04 All right, we're getting more plot.
00:19:05 We're getting more plot.
00:19:06 OK, all right, all right.
00:19:07 OK, so there are some things happening right here.
00:19:09 Oh, god, oh, god.
00:19:12 There they are.
00:19:13 Look.
00:19:14 They can't.
00:19:15 They think they're going to get run over.
00:19:17 They're going to get run over.
00:19:18 All right, well, that's what we're doing right now.
00:19:22 Which one am I?
00:19:23 Am I those?
00:19:23 You're a walkie-talkie.
00:19:26 I'm the young man.
00:19:27 You're a fucking Obi-Wan, bro.
00:19:29 Die, Gungans.
00:19:31 And die.
00:19:33 And die, Gungans.
00:19:34 Dude, it's a jar jar.
00:19:35 Dude, I saw a jar jar.
00:19:36 No, it's just his race.
00:19:37 You can't say all they'll look the same.
00:19:39 Oh, it took him apart.
00:19:41 It was great.
00:19:42 It was worth it.
00:19:43 A Gungan is a Gungan.
00:19:44 You can't say it's only half of a race.
00:19:45 Half.
00:19:47 Dude, I am best friends with TJ Henry Yoshi on Twitter.
00:19:50 All right, hey, Ben, I'm going to make a hit.
00:19:52 Well, I'm going to make a hit.
00:19:52 I follow him.
00:19:53 So, yeah.
00:19:54 You follow him?
00:19:55 Does he follow back?
00:19:56 No.
00:19:57 Best friends, best friends.
00:19:58 Best friends.
00:19:58 That's all it takes.
00:19:59 I know this guy.
00:20:00 It's like you follow him.
00:20:02 Yeah, that's it.
00:20:03 I have a friend on the internet.
00:20:05 It's time to start the Ben St.
00:20:07 Hit piece.
00:20:07 Here's what's going to be.
00:20:08 You are a race, like a butcher.
00:20:10 No, thief, Ben.
00:20:12 You are the two other people's races.
00:20:14 I'm sick and tired of it.
00:20:15 The other day, I heard you ordering some Mexican food
00:20:18 on this phone.
00:20:19 Not cool.
00:20:20 Not OK.
00:20:21 Not all right.
00:20:22 Just because we're friends doesn't mean it's all right.
00:20:25 So I'm going to kill you now.
00:20:25 I'm stimulating their economy.
00:20:29 Why would you do that to me?
00:20:31 Look, my head is right there.
00:20:32 I know.
00:20:33 You stole everything I own.
00:20:35 I know I did.
00:20:36 Just I'm best nine.
00:20:38 Everything that I own is gone.
00:20:40 Thank you.
00:20:40 Hey, I want to kill that big yellow thing.
00:20:42 Six times the amount of studs that you have right now.
00:20:45 They stole all the studs that you killed.
00:20:46 I'm going to fucking murder him.
00:20:48 I'm going to murder him for the studs.
00:20:49 The cooperation over it.
00:20:50 It's a burst battle.
00:20:55 It's a, how are you evading my weapons?
00:21:00 Duh.
00:21:03 He's so slippery.
00:21:05 You actually gained more health from me trying to kill you.
00:21:09 That doesn't make sense.
00:21:11 I know.
00:21:13 I got him.
00:21:14 I got him.
00:21:16 Slimefest.
00:21:17 Slimefest 5, baby.
00:21:18 That's not how the movie went.
00:21:19 Slimefest 5.
00:21:20 It's way more interesting.
00:21:21 I want to kill one of those big yellow pack animals.
00:21:24 Remember in episode one where we were like, no, we got to get out the studs.
00:21:28 Don't progress.
00:21:28 We got to kill one of those big yellow studs.
00:21:29 Dude, give me those studs.
00:21:30 Give me those studs.
00:21:31 Don't take those studs.
00:21:33 That's literally how I played this game.
00:21:35 That is actually what I did.
00:21:36 Competitive.
00:21:37 Dude, overheat this fucking bongo.
00:21:39 Oh, damn it.
00:21:40 I fucking pulled him.
00:21:43 Yeah, okay.
00:21:44 I get it.
00:21:45 I get it now.
00:21:46 Listen, you know what?
00:21:47 This game reminded me a little bit too much of my dad, but now...
00:21:50 Listen.
00:21:51 Okay.
00:21:52 Your dad can be many things.
00:21:53 It doesn't have to be only bad.
00:21:54 So let's get rid of him and my dad.
00:21:55 We're also good parts.
00:21:57 Oh, dude.
00:21:58 Guess who it is?
00:21:59 No.
00:22:00 Guess who it is?
00:22:01 Is it Jar Jar?
00:22:02 She's the cause of my daddy, Tusa.
00:22:03 Jar Jar.
00:22:04 She's the cause of my daddy, Tusa.
00:22:06 What the gentle soul he is.
00:22:08 She's the cause of my daddy, Tusa.
00:22:10 What does that mean?
00:22:11 It means that Jar Jar is like a frat boy BDSM ABDL kid.
00:22:17 And then he comes over to his girlfriend's house and he's like, and she says to her dad,
00:22:21 She's the cause of my daddy, Tusa, implying that when they have sexual intercourse, Jar Jar is called dad.
00:22:26 We both immediately go to kill him.
00:22:28 Get the fuck back here.
00:22:30 You know these folks.
00:22:31 Get the fuck back here.
00:22:32 She's...
00:22:33 What's the one that can fly?
00:22:35 Uh, the nun.
00:22:36 It's a nun.
00:22:37 Yeah.
00:22:38 Thinking of that nun from that one show.
00:22:40 I forget what it's called.
00:22:41 Rocko's Martin Life?
00:22:42 It's about a nun that can fly.
00:22:43 Okay.
00:22:44 That's what I was asking about.
00:22:45 Thanks.
00:22:46 Rocko's Martin?
00:22:47 No, it's me.
00:22:48 It's me.
00:22:49 But it's just me.
00:22:50 It's just me.
00:22:51 Oh, it was you?
00:22:52 Oops.
00:22:53 Sorry.
00:22:54 You just looked really upsetting.
00:22:56 It made me mad.
00:22:57 She's mad.
00:22:58 She's so hot.
00:22:59 We switch characters.
00:23:00 Yeah, it's not a she.
00:23:01 But you know what?
00:23:02 Yeah.
00:23:03 Well, she's the cause of my daddy, Tusa.
00:23:05 Yeah.
00:23:06 No.
00:23:07 Jar Jar is the kid.
00:23:08 Jar Jar is the foot job kid.
00:23:10 No, she's so hot.
00:23:11 Foot job kid.
00:23:12 Is she topless, dude?
00:23:14 Yeah, dude.
00:23:15 No, you dumb fuck.
00:23:17 No, you have to make it.
00:23:18 You have to make things right.
00:23:19 You have to make things right.
00:23:20 I'm trying.
00:23:21 I can't get back up.
00:23:22 These pulses are out of the world, man.
00:23:25 I can't get back up.
00:23:26 Ben, you're literally like ruining my life right now.
00:23:29 I can't get back up.
00:23:30 I'm sorry.
00:23:31 Oh, there we go.
00:23:32 Wow.
00:23:33 It's almost like I didn't fucking do anything.
00:23:34 You dumb.
00:23:35 And I couldn't do it.
00:23:36 That somehow I just couldn't manage it.
00:23:39 Jesus.
00:23:40 This is the simplest of tasks.
00:23:42 This is like this.
00:23:43 I died.
00:23:44 You know what?
00:23:45 You know what?
00:23:46 This is the most let's play episode of our escape.
00:23:47 This is going to be the most like, you know, last thing we're talking about fucking taxes
00:23:49 and we're talking about fucking aspirations.
00:23:50 Sometimes you've got to fucking chill out and just reminisce about how great fucking video
00:23:54 games are.
00:23:55 And with this, literally the best game ever.
00:23:56 This is the for better.
00:23:57 Only.
00:23:58 Only banner hunters can do this.
00:23:59 It's part of these studs.
00:24:00 All right.
00:24:01 Hell yeah, dude.
00:24:02 Dude.
00:24:03 Like three of those were blue.
00:24:04 All right.
00:24:05 Are we whores?
00:24:06 Question and answer.
00:24:07 Answer.
00:24:08 Yes.
00:24:09 Because we get so many studs.
00:24:10 Just imagine their twitch bits.
00:24:12 Where are the mini kids at?
00:24:14 Where are the mini kids at?
00:24:16 Just imagine their twitch bits and get excited.
00:24:18 Oh God.
00:24:19 I dropped so many.

00:24:44 Because you're going to need to get it real soon.
00:24:45 Because you're fucking proper.
00:24:46 I know.
00:24:47 That was my plan all along.
00:24:49 You can Snap in fucking Endless War.
00:24:51 Dude, we got to put Snap in Endless War.
00:24:53 We should literally put it.
00:24:54 Dude, look at this.
00:24:55 This is limited to the jail.
00:24:57 It's food stamps.
00:24:58 We need food stamps in Endless War.
00:25:00 No.
00:25:01 Okay.
00:25:02 Hold on for a second.
00:25:03 Hold on.
00:25:04 I did do that.
00:25:05 I did.
00:25:06 Hold on.
00:25:07 Dude.

00:25:12 Get the hell ahead, dude.
00:25:13 I mean, we'll shut up next time so you can hear it.
00:25:16 I heard it the first time, but I wasn't impressed.
00:25:18 It doesn't sound.
00:25:19 No, it's so cool.
00:25:20 Oh, Ben.
00:25:21 You're so fucking terrible.
00:25:22 You make me want to kill myself.
00:25:23 How does that keep happening?
00:25:24 How do I...
00:25:25 Oh!
00:25:26 Ben!
00:25:27 You dumb fuck!
00:25:28 I'm better than this.
00:25:29 I'm better than this.
00:25:30 The only reason I die is because Ben who can't protect me for shit and I can't attack is Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar

00:26:06 Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar JarX Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar So we mul it vehmbed it
00:26:08 Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar Jar OD Jar Jar

00:26:28 That's a BA, aka an abbreviation of Boba Vacchina, merged with Basics, some BA6 from a book entitled
00:26:35 BA6, which is formatted like the Holy Bible, aka 3 colon 7, talking about how we have to
00:26:42 have real actual revolution in the United States.
00:26:46 Was real actual revolution actually entailed, as opposed to fake revolution, as opposed
00:26:50 to the revolution you hear about on TV, it's all a fad.
00:26:52 Listen, I'm telling you right now, real actual revolution has come to the United States.
00:26:57 How did you get up there?
00:26:58 I want to get up there.
00:26:59 You double jump, bitch.
00:27:00 I'm double jumping.
00:27:01 I'm double jumping.
00:27:02 Don't, don't help him.
00:27:03 If he's not Jar Jar Binks.
00:27:04 I wouldn't ever say that.
00:27:05 But I want it.
00:27:06 I want it.
00:27:07 I want it.
00:27:08 I don't worry.
00:27:09 I won't tell Ben that he can never get up here unless he's Jar Jar Binks.
00:27:16 Thanks to you.
00:27:17 Unless he used a double jump.
00:27:18 No.
00:27:19 Why is Jar Jar such a good jumper?
00:27:21 Because don't you remember the movie?
00:27:23 It's not a she.
00:27:25 The Breastices.
00:27:26 Isn't there a thing?
00:27:27 He speaks funny.
00:27:28 He jumps good.
00:27:29 Look at her Breastices.
00:27:30 Isn't her sticking out of her Lego form?
00:27:31 Isn't that part of like the Jar Jar is a simpler theory that like there's a part where Jar Jar jumps
00:27:42 really high and if people theorize that he could only do it if he had zip powers?
00:27:46 Yeah.
00:27:47 Is that when he like dives into the water and does like a triple flip and then he's weird?
00:27:50 Okay.
00:27:51 You know that feel when you're like talking about Pokemon with someone and then they use
00:27:53 a gendered pronoun so you know they want to have sex with them?
00:27:56 Yeah.
00:27:57 Yeah.
00:27:58 That's all, that's all Kazi has.
00:27:59 Yeah, that's all you.
00:28:00 When I talk about Terran and I say I love her.
00:28:03 Kazi only talks about Pokemon that she calls she.
00:28:07 Well, no.
00:28:08 I talk about Pokemon that are fuckable and call them he like Floatsoul.
00:28:12 Yeah.
00:28:13 Floatsoul.
00:28:14 Everyone's favorite.
00:28:15 Out of everybody you could have been.
00:28:17 That's the most fuckable Pokemon.
00:28:19 Everyone's favorite Pokewifu Floatsoul.
00:28:23 Yeah, okay.
00:28:24 Well, that I understand.
00:28:27 We have a big problem here.
00:28:30 I'm not into that group shit.
00:28:33 Magnemite?
00:28:34 Magnemite, but not magneton.
00:28:36 What the fuck do you see in magneton?
00:28:38 Not magneton.
00:28:39 I don't do foursome.
00:28:40 I'll give you threesome.
00:28:41 That's fine.
00:28:42 I want two magnemites.
00:28:43 No more.
00:28:44 What's the one, what's the two headed dinosaur?
00:28:48 Are you thinking of giraffe or egg?
00:28:53 No, two headed dinosaur gen five.
00:28:56 Oh, durate.
00:28:57 Durate.
00:28:58 Hydraga.
00:28:59 Hydraga.
00:29:00 Hydraga, but the second one.
00:29:02 Twinsoul.
00:29:03 That one's fine because that one only has two heads.
00:29:06 Fuck, what's the second one called?
00:29:09 Twin dragon.
00:29:10 Double headed dragon man.
00:29:12 Double headed dragon man.
00:29:14 Double headed dragon man.
00:29:16 That one's cool.
00:29:17 That one's got like an emo haircut.
00:29:19 Dude, all right, we're about to be boss nests.
00:29:21 We're about to meet boss nests first of all.
00:29:23 You failed so hard.
00:29:24 Look at myself compared to yours.
00:29:25 You're the reason why you need a true Jedi.
00:29:26 I fucking hate you, Ben.
00:29:27 I fucking hate you.
00:29:28 It's because I kept falling off ledges.
00:29:31 This doesn't count for anything.
00:29:33 You're so fucking dumb.
00:29:34 Look at this.
00:29:35 If you had to be raped by Pokemon, which one would it be?
00:29:40 Look against my will?
00:29:41 That's what the word implies, yes.
00:29:44 It could choose, yeah.
00:29:45 You don't get to choose.
00:29:47 He wants the fuck, Jinx.
00:29:49 Yeah, I do.
00:29:51 That's very racist.
00:29:53 That's very racist of you.
00:29:54 She's super effective against Rekweza because she's an ice type.
00:29:58 A nice type?
00:29:59 Why would you want to fucking ice type?
00:30:01 Because it's super effective against Rekweza.
00:30:03 We failed.
00:30:04 We're not true Jedi.
00:30:05 Your fault.
00:30:06 Look at you.
00:30:07 Dude, we fucked up.
00:30:08 Dude, we lost.
00:30:09 We lost the game.
00:30:12 We lost.
00:30:13 It's your fault, Ben.
00:30:14 I'm sorry that we weren't good enough.
00:30:16 No.
00:30:17 We couldn't make it.
00:30:18 No.
00:30:19 We just couldn't make it happen.
00:30:20 You boy jinked four.
00:30:21 You boy jinked.
00:30:22 Boy jinked?
00:30:23 Boy jinked?
00:30:24 This game's putting me to sleep.
00:30:25 Wait, they're off.
00:30:26 We're making that fun.
00:30:27 Yeah, sure.
00:30:28 I can behind that.
00:30:29 Can you pass me my fucking whore juice right there?
00:30:32 Hell yeah, juice.
00:30:33 I'm not getting...
00:30:34 Oh, actually, yeah.
00:30:35 I guess...
00:30:36 Yes, dude.
00:30:37 I'm not cracking the mic.
00:30:38 Crack that fucking shit with stone juice.
00:30:40 Kidney stone juice?
00:30:41 It's just concentrated kidney stone.
00:30:43 No.
00:30:44 Maybe.
00:30:45 Hey, Ben.
00:30:46 Can I ask you a question?
00:30:47 Yeah.
00:30:48 Can I ask you a question?
00:30:49 Yeah, bro.
00:30:50 How long have you been spending on that dumb bitch juice?
00:30:53 Ever since.
00:30:54 Ever since my discovery.
00:30:55 Ever since I discovered it at Aldi.
00:30:57 All right.
00:30:58 And nothing was ever the same.
00:30:59 You're crazy for thinking that tastes like Bangkok candy.
00:31:02 Bangkok candy is so much more potent and so much more flavorful.
00:31:05 Wait, which one tastes like Bangkok candy?
00:31:07 It's the same.
00:31:08 No, it's completely different.
00:31:09 Is there a Rockstar cotton candy?
00:31:10 Yeah, yeah.
00:31:11 Rockstar experience.
00:31:12 I haven't had the Bangkok candy.
00:31:13 He wants the sobby, obvious, scientific fact.
00:31:15 I'll try it.
00:31:16 That's munchies, but I don't know if he's going to drink it.
00:31:18 Oh, it smells so good.
00:31:19 No, you can have a sip, bro.
00:31:21 I don't want this at all.
00:31:24 It's similar, but not identical.
00:31:26 Hold on.
00:31:27 Let me see.
00:31:28 You have so many different ends.
00:31:29 You can drink to your bed.
00:31:30 Holy shit.
00:31:31 Well, that was mine.
00:31:32 That was his...
00:31:33 I've been collecting them.
00:31:35 I gave him that one.
00:31:36 I gave him that one.
00:31:37 But that one's mine.
00:31:38 This one's mine.
00:31:39 I've been collecting them so that I can smash them on screen.
00:31:42 Dude, this smells like a cotton candy.
00:31:44 Oh, fuck!
00:31:47 I just wanted to be mad at the smashed sour apple.
00:31:50 That smells like a cotton candy and gogurt.
00:31:52 Ben, have you considered like PCP or just cocaine or anything else?
00:31:56 Have I considered PCP on a daily fucking basis, dude?
00:31:59 I would never associate with a PCP.
00:32:02 I wouldn't fuck with that.
00:32:04 Is it a PINE or a MEP habit?
00:32:06 I think I would probably be very well suited to a co-cab, though.
00:32:09 I'm gonna vomit.
00:32:10 I like I love this, but I'm going to throw up at the same time.
00:32:13 This is highly controlled.
00:32:14 Well, it just makes me think of cotton candy and gogurt, which is really good.
00:32:17 Yeah.
00:32:18 But then it's also like an energy...
00:32:20 Ooh, ooh.
00:32:22 Yeah, yeah.
00:32:23 Oh, no.
00:32:24 Oh, damn.
00:32:25 Schedule an Uber.
00:32:26 What the hell?
00:32:27 Schedule an Uber.
00:32:28 I had no idea that you can schedule an Uber.
00:32:30 Makes sense.
00:32:31 Okay, so I do that?
00:32:32 You can press a button to say, don't talk to me.
00:32:35 Really?
00:32:36 Can you really?
00:32:37 Yeah, you're rolling another feature.
00:32:39 There's also the bus.

00:40:31 Drunk enough so we could witness your science and we were able to watch you go to fucking town

00:54:27 No, no, no, you're just really bad at this game. Oh, okay. No, no, no, I
00:54:31 Hope so when we have two people we're more likely to bump in each other and reset our acceleration to zero
00:54:37 Also, we're more likely if you're a bad player aka Ben, then you're gonna hit all the road stop to make us lose
00:54:42 It's all your fucking fault. Don't mess with myself. Yeah

00:55:47 Choice. No, it does the choice, but we can't access it because we're not a tie fighter
00:55:50 We have to be impurely aligned if we want to access that part of the game
00:55:55 Damn
00:56:00 All right, hit this one hit this one. I hit this one. Yes

00:56:46 You come back in free mode. If you come back in free play mode, you're able to lock in the game
00:56:50 It's high fighter
00:57:01 No, that won't help us because we get more if we go this way
00:57:06 It's all about the amount that we get we have to maximize the amount that we get
00:57:12 No
00:57:16 No, okay, I think it's impossible to I think it's impossible to player
00:57:33 The second

01:10:54 Yeah, yeah, who's dead? Who's dead? So this this this youtuber I used to follow he died
01:11:00 I think I told I think I said in the pcp chat and you responded like it was a long time ago
01:11:04 Anyway, it was this educational youtuber. It was like he used a pole in the ball. Which is very nice
01:11:09 How do I use this spot? You have a gun guy. You have to be a gun girl
01:11:14 Well, I don't want to. Okay, that's fine. I just want to be r2d2 and any fucking I I just woke up one day
01:11:20 I saw my recommended and I don't need boss nas

01:11:43 Actually, now I regret that because I'm going to fall asleep if I don't have something in my hands
01:11:47 Okay, what are the controls for this game? What uh, it's it's up. It's upright left and b
01:11:52 Just use use the left button to shoot your gun
01:11:56 Hold on. You have to get up here. We have to progress. You have to progress to get

01:12:11 Click on this click on this click on this click on this click on this yeah
01:12:15 Anyway, he was this educational YouTuber that I loved, and he was the best in the game.
01:12:19 He was literally my favorite YouTuber in the genre, in fact, probably of all time.
01:12:24 And I loved watching his videos, and he was like, he was a young man, right?
01:12:28 He was a small YouTuber.
01:12:30 I think he was at like 300k, so like, not like nothing or anything, but he was like,
01:12:34 you could tell.
01:12:35 You know, it's a big pond, you can hover, you can hover.
01:12:41 It was like, you knew who was going to rise to greatness.
01:12:45 Just like all female video games characters, you can float, like R2-D2.
01:12:49 Exactly.
01:12:50 You knew that he was going to achieve greatness.
01:12:53 And then he fucking straight up just died out of nowhere.
01:12:57 Is it?
01:12:59 It's pretty hot.
01:13:01 Well, I can switch it to AC.
01:13:03 I can steal, I can steal, I can steal from you outside.
01:13:05 I don't believe that this is a gun.
01:13:07 It's not literally a gun, but it's in every practical sense.
01:13:12 Oh, I think maybe I should go to the left.
01:13:14 Why?
01:13:15 Why?
01:13:16 That's, why would you do that?
01:13:17 Well, I mean, you know, sometimes you're intuition is right, but not always.
01:13:25 Oh my god, all I wanted was to fucking die.
01:13:28 We gotta get, oh my god, look at our true Jedi.
01:13:31 We shouldn't even try.
01:13:32 We're not going to get it.
01:13:33 No?
01:13:34 No, we're not going to get it.
01:13:35 There's no way.
01:13:36 What?
01:13:37 Look at how little we have.
01:13:38 With my dedication to the fucking silver bullet.
01:13:40 You will never be a true Jedi.
01:13:42 This was your last chance.
01:13:43 No, listen, we're about to defeat the Phantom Menace right now.
01:13:46 That's not true.
01:13:47 Yeah, we are.
01:13:48 Wait, really?
01:13:49 Yes, you dumb fuck.
01:13:50 What was the Phantom Menace?
01:13:51 I'm not playing this game.
01:13:53 I think I'm pretty sure I never actually played LEGO Star Wars my entire life.
01:13:57 I think I only ever watched those people playing it.
01:14:00 That's, I mean, that's fine.
01:14:01 That's really, you get, you get a lot out of it anyway.
01:14:04 I want the blue one.
01:14:05 I want the blue one.

01:14:19 Wait, are you serious?

01:17:00 I always say that people are ripping off Bang, but I don't know if Bang was not even the progenitor of it.
01:17:05 It just felt that way, because I learned about it in that order.

01:17:40 Okay.
01:17:41 Okay.

01:18:02 In text or in video games.
01:18:04 Well...
01:18:05 You have a green card marriage?
01:18:06 I'd get cut if anyone knew that I had a wife.
01:18:08 I'm sure of it.
01:18:10 Cab lovingly incubated Claire for you.
01:18:13 Sinclair for you.
01:18:14 And you haven't acknowledged your existence even once.
01:18:16 Uh, it's a green card marriage.
01:18:19 Okay.
01:18:20 I needed citizenship.
01:18:22 Look at these beautiful bubbles right here.

01:18:50 We need no friends allowed.
01:18:51 Our whole family.
01:18:52 Our whole clan.
01:18:53 I had to do it.
01:18:54 I had to do it to activate my fucking sharring on or whatever.
01:18:57 Listen, when you kill someone, you get their worth.
01:18:59 So you have a binary, like a numeral, like integer.
01:19:02 A numeral?
01:19:03 A numeral integer as it sounds.
01:19:05 A numeral integer.
01:19:07 A numeral integer for each of your worths.
01:19:10 And your worth can go up and it can go down based upon numerals.
01:19:14 That's the guy that did the Colorado piece.
01:19:17 No, you know, stop, stop, stop it.
01:19:19 Oh, actually, sorry.
01:19:20 That wasn't him that was actually watching about that.

01:19:23 Did he think something stupid?
01:19:24 No, no, no.
01:19:25 I wasn't talking about that.
01:19:27 You can out me as a hack in a fraud.
01:19:29 That's fine.

01:21:46 The sea ice is a terrible vodka, but there's two big handles of it.
01:21:49 It's a plastic bottle.
01:21:50 I had to buy both of them because it was $9.99.
01:21:54 $8.99 for a liter, $9.99 for a liter, $75.
01:21:59 These numbers don't lie.

01:22:04 And they're whispering behind me.
01:22:06 This is a gated community.

01:22:11 And it's fucking sick.
01:22:12 Yeah.
01:22:13 It's fucking sick.

01:37:16 because as more and more people walked up to the stage do their bit to do their
01:37:20 sketch Ben's walked in empty-handed dumb ass yeah it was normal pee so we didn't
01:37:29 get a jar I don't know I didn't want to see my pee I got back full oh my god you
01:37:36 get so you make it nice and fluorescent yeah guys are you guys know about the

01:37:46 let me in my seat no let me in my seat let me in my you can play the game from
01:37:51 behind the back seat you can play the game from behind the fucking back seat jail cell so so we
01:37:56 go inside like and it's like we are the only people there that's it it's the first time I
01:38:01 ever been to a comedy show and it was like really kind of hilariously bad in a way okay it wasn't
01:38:08 like it wasn't bad but it was it was like okay here's the thing if you tell a joke on stage and
01:38:14 you're at a comedy show I know and there's only a couple people in the audience no matter what
01:38:20 even if everyone like laughs at your joke you're still only getting what sounds like a little
01:38:25 tiny laugh yeah because there's not that many there's not enough people to have it be like
01:38:28 haha yeah oh for sure yeah yeah yeah so when someone tells a joke and they're and then there's
01:38:35 free and people laugh it sounds like the joke didn't land and so they go cool so look at that yeah
01:38:43 that's cool by the way dude fucking the police sirens are blaring they're coming for you so because
01:38:49 we this is the titular limelight by the way what you're doing right now the titular limelight
01:38:53 because we're the only people in the audience that weren't part of the show all the comedians

01:39:02 like asked questions about us and like responded to us when we said things so like a few people

01:48:12 in the place that it's supposed to be in.
01:48:15 You left these studs on the table, man, hi.
01:48:18 Well, listen, man, listen, man,
01:48:20 Ace of Spades is playing Ghost Star of the Jedi.
01:48:22 Yeah, not even close.
01:48:24 I know, it's truly pitiful.
01:48:25 Hey, you did it.
01:48:27 Fucking, here, look, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:48:31 Please, please, please, what do you mean?
01:48:33 Oh, there's the boys!
01:48:35 No.
01:48:36 The boys.
01:48:37 Damn!
01:48:38 Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
01:48:41 You want a trophy?
01:48:41 Okay, all right, bid us to play the next level,
01:48:43 because it's the most climactic thing to ever exist.
01:48:47 Caroline, over here, Caroline, over here.
01:48:48 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
01:48:50 Please, please, please, please, please, please.
01:48:51 Oh my God, I have to come right now.
01:48:52 What were we talking about?
01:48:53 Oh yeah, the hot pot sucked.
01:48:54 The broth tasted like fucking dish water.
01:48:57 It wasn't very delicious.
01:48:58 They overcharged us.
01:48:59 They wail.
01:49:00 Ridiculously overcharged us for some shit.
01:49:02 Okay, so there's an item on the menu called meat lovers.
01:49:06 It was called meat lovers.
01:49:07 It was not called meat lovers, it was like a meat platter.
01:49:09 Okay, Laura, beef lovers.
01:49:10 It was called beef lovers.
01:49:11 It was called beef lovers.
01:49:12 Was it actual?
01:49:13 Yeah, it was called beef lovers.
01:49:14 Okay, so it was called beef lovers.
01:49:15 We get it.
01:49:16 What was shit?
01:49:17 It's $35, and we think, okay, $35.
01:49:19 That's gonna be like a big thing for a group to eat.
01:49:22 Yeah.
01:49:23 Well, they said it was for two, and we got it for three, so.
01:49:27 Yeah.
01:49:27 Well, okay, okay.
01:49:28 We had to tip this off.
01:49:29 No, wait, hold on, that is relevant.
01:49:32 However, I will say that we knew that,
01:49:35 but you get the information,
01:49:35 and then it got sides all of us each
01:49:38 to compensate for that.
01:49:39 So we got the meat lovers thinking that would be our meat,
01:49:41 and then we would get sides to fill up the rest.
01:49:43 You guys.
01:49:44 Super slide, we got super slide.
01:49:45 Yeah.
01:49:46 Well, you did at the end.
01:49:47 And the point is it was like,
01:49:48 it was barely enough for one person.
01:49:50 Like, I don't think it would even be enough for one person.
01:49:52 No, we would play for one.
01:49:53 Maybe, maybe.
01:49:55 But the point is that it was way overpriced,
01:49:57 way not enough, and it wasn't very good.
01:50:00 It wasn't very delicious.
01:50:01 But you know, the concept of the hot pot,
01:50:03 the romantic, platonic ideal of the hot pot,
01:50:06 being like a social experience,
01:50:09 where you're all in the hot pot,
01:50:11 it's just this big, warm, boiling pot of broth.
01:50:15 You stick shit in the pot,
01:50:16 you take it out of the pot, you eat it.
01:50:18 The idea of that,
01:50:19 mwah.
01:50:20 So we think we must be doing something wrong.
01:50:22 I researched.
01:50:23 I learned how to do the hot pot correctly,
01:50:26 and we went to a place that we were thinking of going to
01:50:28 on the first day,
01:50:29 but we didn't go to in favor of Cassey Snip.
01:50:32 Because you-
01:50:33 Big mistake.
01:50:33 Because no way, right.
01:50:35 No, you, oh yeah, you wanted lamb.
01:50:37 You wanted lamb chops.
01:50:38 Yeah, no, no, no.
01:50:39 I wanted to go to the happy lamb.
01:50:40 You were pushing for lamb chops.
01:50:41 Well, you were pushing for the happy lamb purely
01:50:43 on the basis of the name.
01:50:45 Yeah.
01:50:46 There was no way to tell.
01:50:47 Yeah, no, but I knew, but I knew that would be good.
01:50:50 There was no information.
01:50:51 I was-
01:50:52 No, okay.
01:50:53 Because they didn't have like a menu on their website,
01:50:54 they didn't have a website or anything.
01:50:55 Oh, okay, okay, no, no, okay, hold on.
01:50:57 Here's how I knew.
01:50:58 I walked by.
01:50:59 Oh, the movie's starting.
01:51:01 Oh, oh, yeah.
01:51:01 Yeah, everyone shut the fuck up.
01:51:02 Everyone shut the fuck up.
01:51:03 It's starting.
01:51:04 Chapter six.
01:51:05 Chapter six.
01:51:06 Door is small.
01:51:07 The trade federation army has been neutralized,
01:51:10 but I can't, I won't go in.
01:51:11 Give me that.
01:51:12 I'm switching in.
01:51:13 I'm tagging in.
01:51:13 All right, fine.
01:51:14 I'm tagging in.
01:51:15 All right, fine.
01:51:16 Now I get to play the video game.
01:51:17 Okay, no, here's how you tell a good restaurant.
01:51:19 Literally, here's how you tell, you look at it
01:51:21 and think, wow, is it good graphic design or not?
01:51:24 It had great graphic design,
01:51:25 and I could tell that it was chic and crowded as hell.
01:51:28 That's great, unironic, great justification
01:51:31 for going to a restaurant.
01:51:32 Okay.
01:51:33 Casus temp was out of the way and not very cool.
01:51:36 Well, you know, when we start,
01:51:40 when we got the regular beef, and it's not the beef lovers,
01:51:43 like it was just the beef lovers
01:51:44 that was overpriced and shit.
01:51:46 Like everything else was not so bad,
01:51:48 but we didn't get any of that.
01:51:49 We just did it wrong.
01:51:51 You are a fucking moron.
01:51:53 We have to play the game.
01:51:55 Come on.
01:51:55 So it just automatically reflects the days back.
01:51:58 Yeah, but you had to time it.
01:52:01 Come on, Dara.
01:52:02 Hell yeah.
01:52:03 Come on, Mr. Mall.
01:52:04 I wonder, I took a picture of when we went to Happy Lamb
01:52:07 and got a really good hot pot.
01:52:09 Yeah, put it on the screen.
01:52:10 Yeah, it was really colorful and really beautiful.
01:52:13 I kept looking at it and I took a picture.
01:52:15 Wait, hold on, before we put it on,
01:52:16 I just want to say, I really didn't like Casus temp.
01:52:22 And so until a couple of days later,
01:52:23 I still wanted hot pot because I wanted to redeem myself.
01:52:26 So we go to Happy Lamb, finally you cave the pressure
01:52:28 and you allow me to go to the place that I knew it would be great
01:52:30 and it was.
01:52:31 We go in like five minutes before they open.
01:52:33 It's completely shrouded in darkness.
01:52:36 It's shrouded in darkness.
01:52:37 We walk.
01:52:38 Wait, you got there as they open?
01:52:39 Yeah, we got there like 30 minutes before they're opening
01:52:42 and we walked in, like the door was unlocked,
01:52:45 but the lights were off, but all the tables were set.
01:52:48 I thought it was like scary.
01:52:50 What are you talking about?
01:52:51 And then some lady appeared from out of the shadow.
01:52:53 Are you literally stupid?
01:52:54 Maybe.
01:52:55 We get true dead eye.
01:52:56 Oh wow, thanks for the droids.
01:52:58 Get the blue.
01:53:01 We got to get all the sets, bro.
01:53:02 Come on, we've lost our ways, we gotta do that.
01:53:03 Anyway, yeah, so we go to Happy Lamb
01:53:05 and just show them the image,
01:53:07 because that's all you need to know.
01:53:09 That's all you fucking need to know
01:53:10 is show them that fucking image.
01:53:11 Let's see how it looks on.
01:53:14 Yeah, great.
01:53:15 Okay, well you can't really.
01:53:16 It looks like a fetus.
01:53:18 It looks like some fucking mess.
01:53:20 You can't really tell that good.
01:53:22 No, no, but trust us, it looks great.
01:53:24 It's really.
01:53:25 It's a lot of meat.
01:53:26 It's a lot of meat.
01:53:27 Okay, and.
01:53:28 No, it's not the plate of meat, it's the bra.
01:53:29 Oh, okay, I'm gonna show them the preview.
01:53:31 So can you give like an estimate
01:53:33 of how big the plate that we got at Cassey Snap was?
01:53:34 Like how big the $35 plate.
01:53:38 Maybe like this big, and it had,
01:53:41 honestly there were only maybe like 20 slices of beef on there
01:53:45 and like their thin slices.
01:53:46 It had, I would say it had five different types of beef
01:53:50 and then maybe like.
01:53:51 No, there were like three.
01:53:52 There weren't that many, there were like three.
01:53:54 This under $10.
01:53:57 It's okay.
01:53:58 Oh, there you go, there you can see it.
01:54:00 Under $10.
01:54:03 Look at all that slime.
01:54:04 Look at all that fucking delicious shredded podrans.
01:54:07 Imagine thinly sliced podrans that you dip into a hot pot
01:54:10 full of juvie blood.
01:54:11 Oh, dude, you just fell, you fell, you dropped the glue.
01:54:14 We'll never get through Jedi now.
01:54:15 All right, that's, you know what, that's fine.
01:54:18 That's fine.
01:54:19 Is it though?
01:54:20 No, it's not.
01:54:20 Yeah, I didn't think that.
01:54:22 It was pretty good, and also they had potatoes.
01:54:24 We just started the whole game over.
01:54:25 They had potatoes with this hot pot.
01:54:26 That was one of the vegetable options.
01:54:27 That was a really good decision.
01:54:29 Okay, okay.
01:54:30 You know, like it melts in your mouth.
01:54:32 It might seem obvious to those of you who know
01:54:35 the hot pot experience.
01:54:36 It may seem like, you know, oh, obvious,
01:54:38 but like the point of the hot pot
01:54:40 is to literally just make a soup.
01:54:42 You know, you have to make the broth yourself.
01:54:44 So you're the whole point of it
01:54:46 is that over the course of the meal,
01:54:47 you are creating the exact soup that you want,
01:54:49 adding in the materials and adding all the stuff.
01:54:51 So what's really important to a soup,
01:54:53 obviously is the broth.
01:54:55 And when your broth tastes like fucking dishwater,
01:54:57 it's not gonna be an experience.
01:54:59 But this fucking place was so like into their broth
01:55:03 that they had a giant neon sign that said broth so hard.
01:55:06 Oh yeah, yeah, broth so hard.
01:55:08 That's their slogan.
01:55:09 All the shirts in place. Yeah, yeah, that's their slogan.
01:55:12 It's broth so hard.
01:55:14 Broth so hard.
01:55:16 It's broth so hard.
01:55:17 Three blues, three blues, three blues, three blues.

01:55:56 Well there's blue though.
01:55:57 We can't get blue though.

01:56:09 What is blue man group?
01:56:10 Blue man group seems like it would suck.
01:56:12 Oh.
01:56:13 Yeah.
01:56:14 It's a, well it's like, it's like music,
01:56:17 but it's also like a performance thing.

01:56:21 They do like cool.
01:56:22 Yeah, exactly.
01:56:23 They do like.
01:56:24 When he was a boy.
01:56:26 He'd play by the sea and then by the sea.
01:56:32 By age 15, he'd left the shore.
01:56:36 On a captain sailing on the shore.
01:56:42 Woo.
01:56:43 The navy was just taking a lick.
01:56:45 Pirates had invaded the ship.
01:56:48 Balak's was on the Aint Harpoon.
01:56:51 He rang their round with a spark and a boon.
01:56:53 The pirate's away.
01:56:58 And navy said, Captain Albert Alec Zander.
01:57:04 Look down in the sea.
01:57:09 But that Captain Albert Alec Zander.
01:57:14 Look down in the sea.
01:57:17 And the end.
01:57:21 Yeah.
01:57:22 My favorite song.
01:57:23 Hell fucking yeah dude.
01:57:25 It's a good, it's a jaunty little tune.
01:57:27 That's for sure.
01:57:30 Chotey little friend.
01:57:31 He's a chotey little friend.
01:57:32 Yeah, it's a Chotey little friend.
01:57:34 Chotey little friend doesn't die when you cut him in half.
01:57:36 No.
01:57:36 What?
01:57:37 That feel when you.
01:57:38 We haven't cut him in half yet.
01:57:38 We just threw barrels at him.
01:57:40 When you cut him in half, he falls to the ground and doesn't die.
01:57:42 Yeah, he just gets robot legs.
01:57:44 Ben, Ben.
01:57:45 That feels like it's hard to even half.
01:57:46 He comes back in Clone Wars with robot legs.
01:57:48 Ben, you know what makes me so mad when we're walking down
01:57:50 in the city and you like move like faster than me and Kazi.
01:57:52 And these are moving so fast, the screen moves,
01:57:54 and we get like automatically slided to where you are.
01:57:56 Like that.
01:57:58 Classic.
01:57:59 I hate when you do that.
01:58:00 Classic move on my part.

01:58:04 You're so fucking dumb.
01:58:06 And we won.
01:58:07 We won.
01:58:07 And we won.
01:58:09 We're so close to Tujena right now, by the way.
01:58:12 Look at that mannequin over there.
01:58:13 Are you joking, man?
01:58:14 I don't think they're joking.
01:58:15 I think they're good, luxurious.
01:58:19 What were we talking about before we started singing?
01:58:21 A hot pot.
01:58:22 Oh, yeah.
01:58:23 Never again.
01:58:24 No, not even the good one.
01:58:25 No, no, no, dude.
01:58:26 Ben, hot pot.
01:58:28 All right.
01:58:28 Yeah, you know what?
01:58:29 You're right.
01:58:30 Dude, straight up.
01:58:31 It will be so fucking good.
01:58:32 The Happy Lamb is actually Kino, unironically.
01:58:35 OK.
01:58:36 All right.
01:58:37 You know what?
01:58:38 You know what I want to do so bad?
01:58:39 I want to have another RSVK con.
01:58:40 So, like, unbelievable much.
01:58:42 Aren't you doing one in Europe?
01:58:44 Yeah, but you know, fucking whatever.
01:58:47 How many European members do you have?
01:58:50 There's a lot, actually.
01:58:51 There's actually a lot.
01:58:52 Yeah, no.
01:58:52 Like Portugal and, like, Ireland.
01:58:55 Right at the top of my head.
01:58:56 There's Ladderless.
01:58:57 There's Shawnee.
01:58:57 There's Hale.
01:58:58 There's Magic.
01:58:59 A bunch from Germany.
01:58:59 A bunch from Germany.
01:59:00 Yeah, I do two of the codes from Germany.
01:59:02 Spain, Tardis from Spain.
01:59:05 Tardis from Spain.
01:59:06 Slimes is from Portugal, I'm pretty sure.
01:59:09 I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.
01:59:12 Dude, there were so many Portuguese, right?
01:59:15 There were so many Portuguese.
01:59:17 You're so bad.
01:59:18 Yeah, well, what are you going to do?
01:59:19 You've really ruined the game for us.
01:59:22 Yeah, I should have ground pounded.
01:59:23 What?
01:59:24 They obliterated me.
01:59:25 You're so, you're going to literally make us
01:59:26 lose true Jedi by looking at you.
01:59:28 Like, Ben.
01:59:30 I tried ground, you, that was you.
01:59:31 That was you.
01:59:32 I tried ground pounding and they just shot me out of the air
01:59:34 and I died.
01:59:35 You are so, like, the opposite of someone who's good.
01:59:39 I'm not, you're saying I'm not a true Jedi?
01:59:41 Yeah, I'm saying that you are a fake Jedi.
01:59:43 You're a fake fan.
01:59:45 What's worse than being a fake fan of true Jedi?
01:59:47 No!
01:59:49 Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
01:59:51 Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
01:59:55 Da-bup-ba-da-da-bup-ba-da-da-da.
01:59:58 This is like slime pest all over again.
02:00:01 Only better.
02:00:02 And for free.
02:00:03 For free.
02:00:04 Hell yeah.
02:00:05 Actually, you know what?
02:00:06 Apollo was exactly right.
02:00:08 It was just about ground pounding.
02:00:10 Ground pounding you win.
02:00:11 I know.
02:00:11 I've been doing that at the highest entire time.
02:00:15 You may sail the way.
02:00:17 Dude.
02:00:17 Free.
02:00:18 You remind me of a fucking mollusk.
02:00:31 No.
02:00:32 Oh, I only got one.
02:00:34 No, this fucking guy over here is calling his fucking jockstrap assholes to come in.
02:00:39 God, my favorite fetish is jockstrap assholes.
02:00:42 Yeah.
02:00:43 No, yeah.
02:00:44 I love, like, smelly men.
02:00:45 I love men that are smelling also fat and also muscular.
02:00:48 You just keep attacking and you just deflect all their shots.
02:00:51 Yeah.
02:00:52 You'll never get hit.
02:00:53 That's the game.
02:00:54 You're not even MLG.
02:00:55 That's the game.
02:00:56 Racket killer.
02:00:57 Come over here.
02:00:58 Come over here.
02:00:59 Come over here.
02:01:00 I'm coming.
02:01:01 I'm going.
02:01:02 I'm over here.
02:01:03 Come over here.
02:01:04 Come over here.
02:01:05 I thought you were about...
02:01:06 I thought I was going to eat it.
02:01:07 Look at us right now.
02:01:08 Yeah, we were so close.
02:01:09 Ha-ha.
02:01:10 Where'd we go?
02:01:11 Are we done?
02:01:12 No.
02:01:13 No.
02:01:14 Not even close.
02:01:15 Not even close.
02:01:16 Is our adventure at an end?
02:01:17 Not even close.
02:01:18 How long have we been recording?
02:01:19 Two hours.
02:01:20 Not only two hours, it feels like...
02:01:21 It feels like an all day.
02:01:22 Not, dude.
02:01:23 It feels like the 24-hour stream all over again.
02:01:24 No, no, no, no, bro.
02:01:25 Not, dude.
02:01:26 I have the words on Nightmare.
02:01:27 You know what we should do, though?
02:01:28 You know what we should do?
02:01:29 We should just do, like, an episode of each thing.
02:01:31 So we can have six ready-fuckers cop killers fucking this.
02:01:36 Oh, fuck you!
02:01:37 Hey, fuck you!
02:01:38 Oh, hey, man!
02:01:39 No, fuck you!

02:01:41 Hey, no, fuck you, dude!
02:01:42 Come on!
02:01:43 Come on!
02:01:44 Fuck!
02:01:45 Or even be on the show.
02:01:46 Actually, you know what?
02:01:47 No, no, no, no.
02:01:48 I'm still wearing a go.
02:01:49 I can go all fucking night.
02:01:50 Let's do episode two.
02:01:51 Let's do episode two.
02:01:52 Let's fucking go Clone Wars.
02:01:54 The best fucking movie that there is.
02:01:57 That's accurate.
02:01:58 Yeah, hell yeah.
02:01:59 I liked the video game almost as much as I liked.
02:02:03 I gotta get this blue.
02:02:04 I gotta get this blue.
02:02:06 I thought it was gonna be good.
02:02:08 Come on, dude.
02:02:09 Come on, dude.
02:02:10 Oh, dude.
02:02:11 Well.
02:02:12 Wow, you did eat it.
02:02:13 Wow, you did eat it.
02:02:14 Oh, I lost.
02:02:15 Oh, twice.
02:02:16 I don't have any more bits to lose.
02:02:20 Ah!
02:02:21 190 fucking studs.
02:02:24 That's me.
02:02:25 Oh, my God.
02:02:26 Ben, did you see yourself?
02:02:28 What?
02:02:29 Did I just almost go over?
02:02:30 Yes.
02:02:31 Well, but I didn't, though.
02:02:33 Easy.
02:02:34 Easy.
02:02:35 Easy.
02:02:36 Yeah?
02:02:37 Is it?
02:02:38 Oh, oh.
02:02:39 Dude, I don't even have any more fucking things to lose.
02:02:44 God damn it.
02:02:46 Help me.
02:02:47 No, he's not.
02:02:48 What am I supposed to do?
02:02:49 Oh, my God.
02:02:50 You're so defensive.
02:02:51 You're like a juvie.
02:02:52 All right, Ben.
02:02:53 I'm a true Jedi, dude.
02:02:55 All right, Ben.
02:02:56 Here's what I want to talk about exclusively.
02:02:57 Here's the only thing I want to talk about.
02:02:59 You've been fucking me up.
02:03:00 Oh, by the way, did you release the Vaporette?
02:03:02 Did you release the Vaporette that you said you were gonna do by next PCP?
02:03:05 I forgot.
02:03:07 That was today.
02:03:09 Wait, no.
02:03:10 Is it Friday?
02:03:11 Yes.
02:03:12 Oh, my God.
02:03:13 I totally forgot to do that.
02:03:15 Fuck.
02:03:16 How embarrassing.
02:03:17 That's really embarrassing.
02:03:18 I mean, I have it.
02:03:20 It's not like I don't have it to release.
02:03:21 I just forgot today was Friday.
02:03:23 That's really funny.
02:03:24 Okay.
02:03:25 Well, as soon as we're done, we should end this immediately so I can go do that.
02:03:29 What are we doing?
02:03:31 Oh, wait.
02:03:32 Okay.
02:03:33 Okay.
02:03:34 One, two, three.
02:03:35 There we go.
02:03:36 Wow.
02:03:37 What a great puzzle.
02:03:38 What the fuck is what is happening?
02:03:40 Like, what does that do?
02:03:42 Okay.
02:03:43 Great.
02:03:44 Okay.
02:03:45 Okay.
02:03:46 Speaking of Vapers.
02:03:47 You need...
02:03:48 Dude, I'm so pissed now.
02:03:49 I'm so pissed at myself.
02:03:50 Yeah?
02:03:51 Are you?
02:03:52 Yeah.
02:03:53 I fucked it up.
02:03:54 Whatever.
02:03:55 Dude, you had a busy week or something.
02:03:56 Yeah, I did.
02:03:57 I mean, yeah, that is why, but it's still disgusting.
02:04:00 That's horrible.
02:04:01 All right.
02:04:02 Kind of three.
02:04:03 Kind of three.
02:04:04 One, two, three.
02:04:05 Wow.
02:04:06 Why didn't it work?
02:04:07 One, two, three.
02:04:08 There we go.
02:04:09 Get the studs.
02:04:10 Get the studs.
02:04:11 Okay.
02:04:12 Ben, when are you going to return home?
02:04:15 No, really, actually this time.
02:04:17 What are you talking about?
02:04:19 Unironically, your presence is needed in this war.
02:04:22 Especially...
02:04:23 Okay.
02:04:24 I'm going to get real with you for a second, Ben.
02:04:25 I'm going to get absolutely unironically real right now.
02:04:28 No, not again.
02:04:30 One of these days, in real life, I will be here in Boston, which will be good for RFCK,
02:04:36 the show, but I'll be here doing college.
02:04:39 I will not have as much free time as I do right now to code and to be the sole kingpin
02:04:46 that there is in the game.
02:04:48 RFCK cannot exist, or I'm sorry, endless war cannot exist if both kingpins are completely
02:04:54 absent.
02:04:55 It cannot exist without us.
02:04:57 RFCK...
02:04:58 I keep saying RFCK when I mean endless war.
02:05:01 Endless war is the most creative, imaginative, and most amazing thing that I have been a
02:05:06 part of to this day.
02:05:08 And to let it completely clay-fallow while I'm not able to personally be there would
02:05:14 be an absolute fucking travesty.
02:05:16 And you need to, as a kingpin, to clock in during that time.
02:05:20 Will you be able to do so?
02:05:22 No.
02:05:23 Yeah.
02:05:24 Yeah?
02:05:25 Yeah.
02:05:26 So?
02:05:27 Yeah, I mean, I don't mean to never come back.
02:05:30 I wasn't a plan.
02:05:32 And I don't want to grill you either.
02:05:34 I'm just saying.
02:05:35 You're totally grilling me, dude.
02:05:36 I know I am grilling you because you fucking deserve it.
02:05:38 Okay, so you did mean to grill me.
02:05:40 Well, yes.
02:05:41 Is what you're saying.
02:05:42 Yeah.
02:05:43 Everyone loves you, Ben.
02:05:45 Everyone wants you to be a part of their lives.
02:05:48 Listen.
02:05:49 It's not that I didn't like it.
02:05:51 That's not why I haven't been around.
02:05:53 I've just been busy.
02:05:55 Well, you know, it sucks.
02:05:57 That's how it is.
02:05:59 Can you not find time to come in?
02:06:01 Can you find it in your apartment?
02:06:03 Yeah, he's dead.
02:06:04 He's excised.
02:06:05 Yeah.
02:06:06 What?
02:06:07 He's dead.
02:06:08 What?
02:06:09 Yeah.
02:06:10 Also, what did Ben not do that was embarrassing?
02:06:12 What?
02:06:13 I heard.
02:06:14 Oh, oh, oh.
02:06:15 I said I was going to release the vaporette on the website today.
02:06:17 And then I forgot to do it.
02:06:18 I mean, it's technically still today.
02:06:21 But I said it was going to be out when the PCP came out and the PCP's out.
02:06:26 And I forgot to do it.
02:06:27 Check out it on his website.
02:06:28 Yeah.
02:06:29 I mean.
02:06:30 Say comments.com.
02:06:31 It'll be out by the time you see it.
02:06:32 I'll do it tonight.
02:06:33 That's so dumb.
02:06:34 Lol.
02:06:35 Dude, are you ready?
02:06:37 Our Just Desserts.
02:06:38 Our Just Desserts.
02:06:39 Tell us a story.
02:06:40 Hey, how long are you guys going to record for?
02:06:43 Do you want to do episode two?
02:06:45 Was this just episode one?
02:06:47 Honestly, I mean, not particularly.
02:06:50 But like, I don't, I don't know.
02:06:53 I feel like it's, we haven't gone, we only gone two hours.
02:06:56 Yeah.
02:06:57 We haven't really gone that long.
02:06:58 I mean, how long did you want to go for?
02:07:00 I was thinking we'd do episode two.
02:07:04 I mean, like what's, do you have a plan in mind for like how long you want to go?
02:07:09 And like what, what do you do after?
02:07:11 Well, I think we just beat episode two and that's it.
02:07:14 That's it?
02:07:15 Yeah.
02:07:16 All right.
02:07:17 All right.
02:07:18 Yeah, we're doing it boys.
02:07:19 7.1%.
02:07:20 7.1% actually.
02:07:21 That's 7.1% of the entire game.
02:07:24 We got 100% of it.
02:07:26 Well, hold on.
02:07:27 Video games are meant to last for years, if not hours.
02:07:31 Yeah, but.
02:07:32 Come on, come on dude.
02:07:34 LEGO Star Wars.
02:07:35 Ben, do you agree that this is the best game we've played ever?
02:07:38 Yes.
02:07:39 I agree.
02:07:40 All right.
02:07:41 Episode two, dude.
02:07:42 Episode two.
02:07:43 Wait.
02:07:44 Wait, dude.
02:07:45 Did Hart come in here?
02:07:46 Yeah.
02:07:47 She popped her head in.
02:07:48 She popped her head in.
02:07:49 That is cracks here.
02:07:50 Does it?
02:07:51 Is that what that means?
02:07:52 I think his jeep is down there.
02:07:56 I told you that four hours ago.
02:07:58 No, I know.
02:07:59 But they were at the grocery store.
02:08:00 I texted Crack and he said he was at the grocery store.
02:08:03 Uh.
02:08:04 Tell them we don't have enough.
02:08:05 Can you make sure you have enough?
02:08:07 Tell them to get their sexy asses in here.
02:08:10 I want to get them all so bad.
02:08:12 All right.
02:08:13 I'll get them.
02:08:14 Okay.
02:08:15 I don't know.
02:08:16 They might be busy with something.
02:08:17 Ben.
02:08:18 Uh-huh.
02:08:19 Oh, he has an interview.
02:08:20 How do I?
02:08:21 Press start?
02:08:22 F2.
02:08:23 What?
02:08:24 What's happening?
02:08:25 I'm pressing.
02:08:26 How did you leave?
02:08:27 I don't know.
02:08:28 I mean, I'm pressing buttons.
02:08:29 Press start?
02:08:30 I am.
02:08:31 What?
02:08:32 What?
02:08:33 Um.
02:08:34 Cool.
02:08:35 Hey.
02:08:36 Hey.
02:08:37 Oh.
02:08:38 Anyway.
02:08:39 Rowdy culture.
02:08:40 Flourishy.
02:08:41 Killer culture.
02:08:42 Stag.
02:08:43 In the fucking toilet.
02:08:44 Yeah.
02:08:45 In the toilet.
02:08:46 There's no, there's no, like, you know, like, cohesive, like, actual culture there.
02:08:52 It's just a bunch of people who, like, are killers for reasons completely other than
02:08:56 you in any way.
02:08:57 That's fine.
02:08:58 Honestly, that doesn't bother me much.
02:09:00 Well, sure.
02:09:01 But there's no, like, actual, like, there's no, being a killer means nothing other than
02:09:05 that your name is purple.
02:09:06 There's no.
02:09:07 That's good enough, right?
02:09:08 No.
02:09:09 No, it's not.
02:09:10 That's plenty.
02:09:11 Okay, hold on.
02:09:12 Is your controller got unplugged?
02:09:13 I think maybe the controller got unplugged.
02:09:15 That's fine.
02:09:16 It's me only now.
02:09:17 Hey, Apollo.
02:09:18 You're the new cop killer.
02:09:19 No.
02:09:20 Cop killer.
02:09:21 Hey, nice.
02:09:22 Still the cops tonight.
02:09:23 Tonight.
02:09:24 Whoa.
02:09:25 Cop killer.
02:09:26 It's the law.
02:09:27 That's all.
02:09:28 That, that, that was the inspiration of the name.
02:09:29 I remember when I first came up with the name where I first cop killers.
02:09:31 Did you pause it?
02:09:32 What's going on?
02:09:33 You, you broke it.
02:09:34 No, you broke it.
02:09:35 What do you mean I broke it?
02:09:36 No, you broke it, dude.
02:09:37 Wait, it moved.
02:09:38 Because you broke it.
02:09:39 It moved.
02:09:40 No, Ben, you broke it.
02:09:41 No, I saw him move, but you broke it.
02:09:43 What do I do?
02:09:44 What do I do?
02:09:45 Well, it's running now.
02:09:46 Good.
02:09:47 No, it has auto saved.
02:09:48 No, it has auto saved.
02:09:49 No, no, Ben.
02:09:50 When should I restart it?
02:09:51 It's broken forever now.
02:09:53 You can't fix it like the disc is broken.
02:09:55 Oh, you cracked the disc.
02:09:57 You cracked the disc.
02:09:58 The disc slipped?
02:09:59 Yeah.
02:10:00 You broke it.
02:10:01 You broke it.
02:10:02 You broke it.
02:10:03 Wait, it moved.
02:10:04 Because you broke it.
02:10:05 It moved.
02:10:06 The disc slipped?
02:10:07 You're going to have to fucking, we're going to have to take us to GameStop.
02:10:10 I hate GameStop.
02:10:12 I hate GameStop employees.
02:10:14 I hate when they try and make video game references out of our credit card transactions.
02:10:18 And when we say, hey, you know, this, this, it sounds weird when you get a confirmed transaction
02:10:25 in your debit card and it goes, eh, eh.
02:10:27 Definitely it's like as a cancellation.
02:10:29 Oh, speaking of it, how much am I being paid for this right now?
02:10:32 You are.
02:10:33 $500 per second.
02:10:34 Thank you.
02:10:35 Thank you so much.
02:10:36 You are making bank right now.
02:10:37 You are siphoning the money out of our bank account.
02:10:43 Okay.
02:10:44 By the way, this is like literally like the worst level in the entire game.
02:10:46 Cool.
02:10:47 I'm glad we decided to do it.
02:10:48 Hey, it still doesn't think that I'm playing the game.
02:10:50 Well, that's fun.
02:10:51 It's not.
02:10:52 No, it's not.
02:10:53 It's not.
02:10:54 No, no, listen.
02:10:55 It's bad.
02:10:56 Well, here, here.
02:10:57 Well, yes.
02:10:59 Much.
02:11:00 No.
02:11:01 No cutscenes.
02:11:02 They're aged up right now.
02:11:03 They're aged up.
02:11:04 No more cutscenes.
02:11:05 No more cutscenes.
02:11:06 Dude, don't you remember the Clone Wars?
02:11:09 Don't you remember the Clone Wars?
02:11:10 Don't you remember how they're trying to assassinate QAnon?
02:11:13 Look at that, dude.
02:11:14 That's what you look like.
02:11:15 That's pretty cool.
02:11:16 How many cops do you kill while you're at the police station?
02:11:18 Four dots.
02:11:19 Well, you'd have to have a gun.
02:11:21 I don't think that many, honestly.
02:11:22 I mean, how many, like, active police officers are just like,
02:11:24 hang on like the lobby of a police station?
02:11:26 Probably not that much.
02:11:27 You could kill like a receptionist, but that wouldn't be a cop, really.
02:11:30 They'd probably have a cop on duty at the desk, right?
02:11:33 I mean, maybe.
02:11:34 I don't know.
02:11:35 But I'm saying that's not the most effective way.
02:11:36 Dude, they're always trapped.
02:11:37 Unironically, thinking about cops just going into a cop station just now,
02:11:40 maybe you want to eat the rest of those donuts downstairs.
02:11:43 What?
02:11:44 Yeah.
02:11:45 Actually, they might be gone.
02:11:46 Dude, this game sucks.
02:11:47 Why can't I control a character?
02:11:48 Yeah, good question.
02:11:49 Hey, like, literally, like, what happened?
02:11:52 You know what?
02:11:53 You know what?
02:11:54 This is fine.
02:11:55 It's a senior game now.
02:11:56 Good luck, Ben.
02:11:57 Here.
02:11:58 You're welcome.
02:11:59 This is fine.
02:12:00 I like this.
02:12:01 Oh, oh, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
02:12:05 Oh, my God.
02:12:06 Ben, I'm about to do something crazy right now.
02:12:08 You're not going to fucking believe what I'm about to do right now.
02:12:10 What are you going to do, dude?
02:12:11 What are you going to do?
02:12:12 You're going to make true Jedi?
02:12:13 Dude, no, I'm going to do something way better.
02:12:15 I'm going to do something way, way, way, way, way fucking better.
02:12:17 You're not going to believe the shit I did.
02:12:19 There's so much collateral damage in this game.
02:12:21 So many people die, but it's okay because they just fall apart,
02:12:24 and you can always get more LEGO pieces.
02:12:26 All right, hold on.
02:12:28 One out of five?
02:12:29 Yeah, one out of five, two out of five.
02:12:32 Hold on.
02:12:33 Okay, you guys may be thinking yourselves,
02:12:35 oh, wow, you know, a video game.
02:12:37 I love video games.
02:12:38 You may be thinking to yourself,
02:12:39 this is not my beautiful house.
02:12:40 This is not my beautiful life.
02:12:41 This is not my beautiful life.
02:12:42 How did I get it?
02:12:43 You may be thinking to yourself,
02:12:44 this is not good commentary.
02:12:45 How did I get it?
02:12:46 Is there a YouTube community of video games?
02:12:49 There must be, right?
02:12:50 There's board games.
02:12:51 I know board games.
02:12:53 I feel like there is a video game,
02:12:55 and I feel like I might have said it.
02:12:57 Dude, it's the anger video game there.
02:12:59 It's not stupid.
02:13:00 The anger video game is Alter Ego Board James.
02:13:02 Oh, it's Alter Ego.
02:13:03 He's like split personality.
02:13:05 Yeah.
02:13:06 He's chill personality.
02:13:08 I remember more.
02:13:09 I think so.
02:13:10 I think Board James is just like a nice man.
02:13:13 So I hate him.
02:13:15 I remember the only episode of Board James
02:13:17 that I ever saw was like him going through
02:13:19 board games that he made when he was like a kid,
02:13:21 and it was like shit.
02:13:22 He's always like, why are you showing me this?
02:13:24 Board James is the number one YouTube channel.
02:13:26 Like what, by the way?
02:13:27 I saw an episode of Board James
02:13:30 where he's playing video game board games.
02:13:35 You know, like there's a Mario board game
02:13:37 and a Pac-Man board game.
02:13:39 The Pac-Man board game I had as a kid,
02:13:41 and it was like a plastic Pac-Man piece,
02:13:45 and there were marbles on the thing,
02:13:47 and you would move it around.
02:13:48 You would stamp it on the marbles,
02:13:50 and it would pick the marbles up underneath it.
02:13:53 And I was like, whoa, I played that game, dude.
02:13:55 I played that video game.
02:13:56 Wow, you're so special for playing a mass
02:13:58 produced game video game.
02:14:00 I also engaged with that media.
02:14:02 Wow, dude, I love brands.
02:14:04 I love brands.
02:14:05 I don't know almost as much as I love franchises.
02:14:07 Hell yeah.
02:14:08 Okay, Ben, you're not prepared for what I'm out to do right now.
02:14:11 Okay, I know a secret.
02:14:13 I know a little bit of a fucking secret.
02:14:15 You can even say that I'm a secret meister.
02:14:17 All right.
02:14:18 Woof, I would never want to.
02:14:20 I don't think I would do that.
02:14:21 That doesn't sound any better.
02:14:22 It requires a little bit of skill.
02:14:24 I might not be able to do it on the first one, but that's fine.
02:14:27 No, no, no, no, no, no.
02:14:29 I was so close.
02:14:30 I was so close.
02:14:32 Okay, hold on.
02:14:33 I'm going to wait for them all to respawn.
02:14:35 End it.
02:14:36 No, don't worry.
02:14:37 End it.
02:14:41 Yeah, I think Kazzy decided that the bargain cracker
02:14:44 cooler than us.
02:14:45 Yeah, you know what?
02:14:46 That's fine.
02:14:47 I did it.
02:14:48 What is this?
02:14:49 What happened?
02:14:50 The red balloon.
02:14:51 You know what they say about red balloons?
02:14:53 The harder they fuck, the harder they ball.
02:14:59 Red balloons blow by.
02:15:03 You know about new endless warming?
02:15:05 No.
02:15:06 You know about lat dancing?
02:15:10 You know about lat dancing, bro?
02:15:12 No, sir.
02:15:13 No, sir.
02:15:14 I do not.
02:15:15 I know nothing.
02:15:16 Yes, red brick, red brick, red brick.
02:15:19 I'm just a secret meister.
02:15:20 We're going to trouble, sir.
02:15:21 You are literally going to shit your fucking pants
02:15:23 when you find out what that red brick has.
02:15:25 Because that means each red brick has its own
02:15:27 like individual power up that it gives you.
02:15:29 It's not randomized at all.
02:15:30 And you're going to shit your fucking pants
02:15:32 when you see what I've got for you.
02:15:35 Look at this side.
02:15:36 Look, this is like literally just in like
02:15:38 inside slump or HQ right now.
02:15:39 This is how they commute to work.
02:15:43 It's delicious.
02:15:44 And I know, right?
02:15:45 I'm getting you hooked.
02:15:47 Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
02:15:48 I can't smoke.
02:15:49 I can't get a fucking hooked.
02:15:52 It's far more deadly than breathing in
02:15:54 than just smoking yourself because it's unfiltered.
02:15:56 Yeah, of course.
02:16:00 Jesus Christ again, again with this thing.
02:16:05 Wow.
02:16:08 This game, like, okay.
02:16:10 Oh, no, sorry.
02:16:11 This level is like not my favorite.
02:16:14 Unlike all the other levels?
02:16:16 Yes.
02:16:17 So every other level, don't worry.
02:16:18 It's completely fine for what will happen.
02:16:21 This level is like...
02:16:23 Oh, it's an incredible payoff.
02:16:24 No, no, literally yes.
02:16:26 You're not going to believe what we got.
02:16:28 This game would be so fucking bad
02:16:30 if it weren't for what I just did just now.
02:16:32 Like the game scene that I've entered currently
02:16:35 is going to rock your little socks off.
02:16:38 Am I crazy?
02:16:39 Or is it too cold in here?
02:16:40 Yeah, you are crazy.
02:16:43 But you know what?
02:16:44 Your house, your rules.
02:16:45 That's right.
02:16:46 Wow.
02:16:47 Thanks.
02:16:48 Oh, it actually got colder.
02:16:49 It's actually colder outside than inside.
02:16:51 Wow, I suburbed in and out of that.
02:16:53 Wow.
02:16:54 Please.
02:16:55 Please.
02:16:57 Please.
02:16:59 Please.
02:17:00 Better you than me.
02:17:02 What?
02:17:03 You idiot.
02:17:04 Just touch it.
02:17:06 Just hit it for fuck's sake.
02:17:11 Why can't you do it?
02:17:14 Okay, there.
02:17:15 Even that didn't look like you actually hit it.
02:17:17 What?
02:17:18 That one, I don't know what happened.
02:17:24 Just hit it.
02:17:27 Crack is here.
02:17:28 Does he want to hang out?
02:17:30 He's making dinner.
02:17:31 What?
02:17:32 They're making dinner downstairs.
02:17:34 What are they making?
02:17:35 They're making like pasta with like a spinach cream sauce.
02:17:40 Pasta?
02:17:41 Are they using the Alfredo?
02:17:42 Garlic bread.
02:17:43 Are they using my Alfredo?
02:17:44 I don't know.
02:17:45 Thank God.
02:17:46 Thank fucking God.
02:17:47 You're so bad at this.
02:17:48 No, I'm not.
02:17:49 I'm really great.
02:17:50 I'm so embarrassed for you.
02:17:51 What happened here?
02:17:52 He couldn't fucking hit the thing.
02:17:53 Why isn't it RFCK now?
02:17:54 He couldn't perform the series of tests.
02:17:56 I know, right?
02:17:57 I think purple and green.
02:17:58 Yeah, it's pretty good.
02:17:59 I thought you guys put a filter on it for a minute.
02:18:01 Nah, dude.
02:18:02 This is just straight up.
02:18:03 Yeah, you wish.
02:18:05 Don't you remember Star Wars Episode II?
02:18:07 Were they going to Neil?
02:18:09 Los Angeles City?
02:18:10 I can't even walk in.
02:18:11 Where is this?
02:18:12 This is Coruscant.
02:18:13 This is Coruscant.
02:18:14 What?
02:18:15 This is Coruscant.
02:18:16 Come on, dude.
02:18:17 Yes.
02:18:18 Yes.
02:18:19 It's a Patreon you get.
02:18:20 You're looking at it.
02:18:21 You see it before you.
02:18:23 It's a Patreon you can get inside Nero Cafe, Cafe Nero.
02:18:27 It's a free Discord game you can play in your browser for free.

02:18:35 I love this by the way.
02:18:37 What?
02:18:38 It's just the way that it's flying.
02:18:39 What do you mean?
02:18:40 He can't.
02:18:41 He just can't do it.
02:18:42 It's funny.
02:18:43 He just can't fucking do it.
02:18:44 He can't handle it.
02:18:45 Nah.
02:18:46 What do you call this right now?
02:18:47 I don't know.
02:18:48 What do I call this?
02:18:50 What do you call this right now?
02:18:51 Come on.
02:18:53 Give me a little cheat.
02:18:55 Give me a little fucking pork.

02:27:05 Who is that? Who is that? Who is that? Who is dad?
02:27:09 Whoa
02:27:10 Whoa, I told you
02:27:13 Whoa
02:27:15 He loves it
02:27:17 Dude, you know, okay. Do that again real quick. This is how you do it Simon
02:27:20 You have to you have to always like you have to like like whenever you want to enter the HQ
02:27:23 You just have to go on these like fucking like dancing little panels right here make the jingle play
02:27:28 Look at this right now
02:27:33 Realizing it was an executive plan course their pro quo they're expecting
02:27:48 No, no, um, of course prick per quo you're expecting a ruler's executive
02:27:56 But it's not the kind you've been used to but certainly game for a laugh
02:28:07 That's that's the cut version of ah, no, uh, please enlist jv
02:28:13 No, no, okay start killer Mufasa's juvia and Simba's rowdy
02:28:20 Simba's a fucking jew
02:28:22 Mufasa's a killer. Yeah, okay. Mufasa's absolutely a killer
02:28:25 The arc of the lanking is Simba becoming going from a juvia, going from a juvia learning how to be around
02:28:32 No, no, no, no, well, that's I actually disagree with that. He goes from being a rowdy with pigma and
02:28:37 Mufasa, pigma and sumo
02:28:40 He's he's yeah, okay. He's a rowdy. Then he becomes a state. He starts as a rowdy hanging hanging out with some kind of a car
02:28:47 He's lying around doing nothing. He's not doing anything at all. Okay. Okay, but but he's being rowdy while doing nothing
02:28:55 I okay, I think the progression is clear
02:28:57 He's a juvia rowdy and then he has to become like a quote-unquote noble person aka a fucking bitch
02:29:03 That'd be mowed down in the streets, right, dude. Dude if Mufasa were here, how would it beat the shit out of him, dude?
02:29:08 We'd beat the shit out of him, dude. We'd be like antelope on that motherfucker
02:29:11 I'm ten times the king Mufasa was. We would be like antelope on the line. What does that mean?
02:29:17 Because he died because he got trampled by antelope. That's not antelope. Will there be?
02:29:22 So you dumb. I don't know what the difference between those two things are
02:29:26 And I don't suspect that there is none. There is a big difference
02:29:30 Wildebeest are just like antelope, but if you like made them barra, that's so terrible
02:29:36 It's not true. It's not true. It's not true. You made that up. You invented that. They're puffing animals in Africa with horns
02:29:43 The same they're just they're just barra antelope
02:29:48 Antelope are just petite wildebeest
02:29:50 Petite? Petite something a fucking like a wrong word to say
02:29:55 Not it not that sexual. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's so like it means something but like, you know what it means, you know
02:30:03 Like people can say things and like like they try to act like they we know they don't want to have sex
02:30:08 But like we know they do want to have sex when you can tell you can see it in their eyes
02:30:13 The worst kind of person is one that wants to have sex
02:30:16 Well that but even worse than that at least people who want to have sex and say that they are are honest about it
02:30:21 People who are like
02:30:22 They do things or like draw things or speaking away and which isn't like directly horny
02:30:27 But you know deep down that they are horny like what are I see I see artists all the time that draw like huge tits and ass
02:30:35 All the time. It's not that they're drawing porn, right? It's not like they are in our nuts. If we're artists
02:30:39 That's their job. They are making porn. They are honest about it. It's like they're trying to pretend in a way trying to not
02:30:45 accentuate
02:30:48 They're trying to not accentuate the fact that they are obviously drawing like porn and tits and shit like that
02:30:53 It's just it's just dishonest. Well, okay, not even that even if they don't have like the big tits and the big ass
02:30:58 You can tell. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no great. When any artist draws any character you can tell based on the way they draw
02:31:03 Even in just the face if they want to fuck that character. Agreed. Agreed. Yeah, just the face you can tell
02:31:08 Usually it's the indication is
02:31:10 Is they have eyelashes
02:31:12 Well, if it's a girl like just this is just in general if there's if there's blushy if there's a lot of blushy
02:31:17 Yes, they want to fuck the character. I would say if there's a character who doesn't have eyelashes normally
02:31:23 And it's a girl. Yeah, but then they give it eyelashes. Oh, yeah
02:31:27 You see I'm more perceptive with uh, when this happens male characters. Uh, where do we go? Really?
02:31:33 I'm way more prospective with with with female characters. I want I wonder why
02:31:38 I wonder why because this this are tits
02:31:41 No, there are
02:31:45 Okay, muchy, where do I go help walk around? I am do it harder. Oh wait Ben's playing. Yeah, put a dumb ass
02:31:54 Me? No, no Ben. Yeah, dude. Fuck it. Yeah, come on, dude
02:32:00 Come on, dude. Where do I go? Go back. Are you looking at uh, what's this place?
02:32:06 Yeah, I'm trying to find the the 10 step program on how to throw the over go behind this government
02:32:10 How'd you find this?
02:32:12 Because I just came back to the to the
02:32:15 Table and tom we're just talking about it. Well, okay
02:32:18 Because because one of my friends isn't call it down every single day. He gets stopped by
02:32:24 The the bob of vacan uh radical revolutionary communist party
02:32:29 And uh, I want to point so
02:32:31 So there there's some it's it's really confusing you see because there are so many things that are all titled things
02:32:36 That I would think that I would want to click on but in fact, they're actually just dead ends because what's like doesn't work at all
02:32:42 So there's stuff like points of attention for the revolution find out about the revolution club of continuing interest and key questions
02:32:48 Of orientation and strategy important publications. I don't always question my orientation. Oh, yeah
02:32:54 I think it might be under how yes, oh
02:32:57 Duh, of course it's under how we can win wins and bold how we can really
02:33:03 Really and make and revolution are all in bold how we can really make revolution to do this
02:33:08 You need to know we need an actual revolution what we need to do now
02:33:13 How we can do to defeat them why we need real revolution. Do you follow? Yeah, I'm with you, man
02:33:19 Okay, so he has this big long prologue bob of vacan the literal god bob of vacan
02:33:25 In fact before I even go any further
02:33:27 Let me just go let me just point out bob of vacan and the way that he chooses to
02:33:31 Represent himself in like like on the main page of his website. This is how he chooses to to do it
02:33:38 Anyway, I'll also tell how bob I know but again friends in college gets off every single day by these guys
02:33:43 And they try and convince him to join a party a political party that that is called
02:33:49 The the revolutionary communist party and when you put revolutionary in your political party name
02:33:56 It's so disingenuous because it's like if you're a player revolution
02:34:00 Not gonna make that you're like your stated goal, you know, but anyway, this is bob of vacan
02:34:05 He'll show up real gay. He has a fucking true blooded julie, right?
02:34:10 He looks he looks great. He looks great. He looks way worse. Please navigate to revcom.us
02:34:16 Please do that so you can understand what he looks like. Anyway
02:34:20 Here are he he he was he's been campaigning since the fucking 60s. He was a hip the original one nice
02:34:26 He's need deep in communism
02:34:28 And he's been calling for communism and I'm just gonna read
02:34:33 Some I'm gonna read under how we could defeat them. This is his stated wages is 50 nights in his government and
02:34:41 I just want you to listen clearly to what he is saying and try and parse through all the pros what the actual
02:34:48 You know stated steps are so please try really hard. Yeah, okay. This is from bob of vacan. This is part of the ba6
02:34:57 When the revolutionary situation is clearly emerging
02:35:01 rapidly transform backbone forces of the revolution into organized fighting forces in key strategic areas
02:35:08 Carry out the necessary training
02:35:10 Obtain the necessary equipment and provide for the basic logistical needs of this revolutionary fighting force to start the all-out fight
02:35:19 While preventing the enemy from crushing the revolutionary forces at this crucial juncture
02:35:24 Back up these core fighting forces with millions of organized into powerful reserves for the revolutionary
02:35:29 Where's he gonna get millions organized into no no no ben you're not listening
02:35:35 Rapidly transform backbone
02:35:38 into this fighting force for the revolution
02:35:44 So like like when the red when the revolution is a situation is clearly emerging like right now
02:35:52 For example currently then just rapidly transform backbone forces
02:35:58 So that's first step that well that answers my first question
02:36:01 Initiate actions throughout the country
02:36:04 Accompanied by a bold declaration to the world
02:36:07 Which makes clear that there is an organized force determined to defeat the forces of the old order and bring into a new
02:36:16 revolutionary system upon completion of these initial actions quickly regroup forces for
02:36:22 Follow on actions and maintain the momentum of the revolution. Okay. I can I can agree with all
02:36:28 So so so tell the world that the week is this
02:36:31 Yeah, which okay good plan good first
02:36:34 Counter the enemy's superior destructive force by seeking superior force the superior destructive force by seeking to
02:36:42 in in italics
02:36:43 Fight only on favorable terms and actively avoiding decisive encounters
02:36:49 Which would determine the outcome of the whole thing until the quote unquote
02:36:54 Balance of forces has shifted overwhelmingly in the favor of the revolution so win
02:37:00 Yeah, yeah, well, it's like wait to fight until we can win
02:37:05 Utilize equipment captured from the enemy in ways that fit the fighting strategy of the revolution
02:37:12 Build up political and logistic basis of support in key strategic areas
02:37:16 But do not attempt to openly control or govern territory until the necessary
02:37:21 Favorable balance forces has been these are a lot of words. Yeah. Yeah
02:37:26 You're getting it Caroline. You're you're starting to get it
02:37:30 In in a real revolution none of this like means anything tactile. Yeah, so it's all like
02:37:37 Listen when the revolution starts when the revolution starts
02:37:42 We win it. We win. Yeah, basically like we transform into a fighting force
02:37:46 Then use guerrilla tactics to win
02:37:49 That's the entirety of the plan not like what cities to capture and it's not like this is for like to export into the entire world
02:37:55 This is like four of the united states four right here right now
02:37:58 He could clearly get into detail about what his plans are but but i'm sure
02:38:04 I'm sure that he's ready for the legality of it and like if he actually tries to ferment actual revolution
02:38:09 They could very easily get shit on and destroyed by the actual government
02:38:13 So it's just being so vague that it means absolutely fucking nothing
02:38:17 So why write this blog post of it if it is just you saying listen
02:38:22 When the revolution starts
02:38:24 Wait until we win
02:38:26 Okay, so what is this revolution for by the way? What's the problem? Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, Ben
02:38:31 You're way all fucking based on the way out face. Okay, it's new communism
02:38:36 Which is scientifically proven to enhance the human condition
02:38:40 Scientific communism a.k.a new communism, which is what he calls it. I believe that I believe that on 100%
02:38:47 I think he's right. I'm on board. You're on board with new communism. Yeah, I think so
02:38:51 Bob the vacant. He's meditated on communism through the good and the admittedly bad, you know of communism
02:38:57 That's why he's released communism to a new communism. What like new coke this time. It'll be better
02:39:04 It's scientifically proven to our business new communism
02:39:08 Did you even read the b.a.6?
02:39:11 I've been even reading b.a.6. I haven't
02:39:13 He was depressed and suicidal
02:39:16 He had to fuck the pedophore. He had to skip Bob the vacant's course on new communism because he was depressed
02:39:23 and suicidal

02:40:51 No, when it's breathing in
02:40:53 Yeah
02:40:54 Fuck yeah, dude. That's so terrible. It gets caught in your throat
02:40:58 Oh my god, Ben. We're so close. Not close enough. We're super close. We're super close. We're zero calories sweetener right now. We're zero calories sweetener.
02:41:08 That's right. Close. I know.
02:41:11 Continue your story, bro. You gotta continue that story.
02:41:14 I must. By the way, guys, we were talking over Baba Vakyan's word, dude. We gotta continue. We gotta know how to fight the real actual revolution, which is how we refer to it constantly in bold and italics, the actual revolution.
02:41:27 As opposed to the other revolutions, which don't count.
02:41:30 Oh, this is the thing I can skip at the start, but that's what I was thinking of.
02:41:34 Open. Open. This is the worst level in the entire game. This is so, so fucking...
02:41:44 Wait, I believe it's this level. It might not be. It might be the next level after this. I forget.
02:41:50 Word up.
02:41:52 Oh, no, no, no. This is actually just a long cutscene. Never mind. This is great level. This is fantastic. This is the best level I've ever heard in my entire life.
02:41:58 Okay. I thought it might be. I had a suspicion.
02:42:01 Oh. Again. Again.
02:42:06 Look at it.
02:42:09 I would give anything to skip this cutscene.
02:42:12 Dude, Ben, I'm hard right now.
02:42:15 Me too, but it's not in a good way.
02:42:18 It's too much for the podcast.
02:42:21 Look, you're going into Saturn right now.
02:42:23 That's not.
02:42:24 This is a galaxy far, far away.
02:42:26 Why is someone going to piss in a jar and find out what color it is?
02:42:28 I'll do it. If I have to pee, I'll do it.
02:42:30 You can pee if you try.
02:42:33 Okay. When you pee and you don't have to, or even when you pee but you don't do it, right?
02:42:38 When you fuck it up.
02:42:39 Oh, no, no, no. Ben, all right, Rockley, let me know if you know this feel.
02:42:42 When you pee, but just sometimes randomly, it's like if you still feel like you have to pee and like you were at like mid-pee but you know that you don't have to pee.
02:42:49 When you have an E.T.I.
02:42:50 No, no, no, no, no, no.
02:42:52 Okay, audience, it's hard to explain.
02:42:54 Sometimes I'll pee and then like it will like, I'll stop.
02:42:58 I'll just fuck it up.
02:42:59 But I'll fuck it up somehow, like I'll pinch my dick too hard or something to that effect.
02:43:03 And then like it will feel like I'm still pee, but I'm not.
02:43:05 You know, I go for the twist, I go for the dick twist and it just doesn't quite...
02:43:09 Yeah, exactly.
02:43:10 Doesn't work out.
02:43:11 Exactly. See, Ben gets it.
02:43:12 Maintain the initiative, or if it is temporarily lost, regain it.
02:43:17 Oh my god.
02:43:18 Yeah, okay, I'm on board with that.
02:43:20 That makes sense.
02:43:21 That makes sense to me.
02:43:22 Through surprise and maneuver, fight in ways...
02:43:26 This guy's really thought about it.
02:43:28 Fight in ways the enemy does not anticipate.
02:43:30 Full sentence in the fight.
02:43:33 Carry out actions to keep the enemy off balance, disrupting the concentration and utilization of his forces and contributing to their disintegration.
02:43:45 Who's he?
02:43:46 The enemy.
02:43:48 So who's the enemy?
02:43:49 The United States.
02:43:50 Okay, so he is the United States forces.
02:43:53 Yeah.
02:43:54 We'll never anticipate.
02:43:55 We gotta make sure they don't anticipate our sneak attack.
02:43:57 Dude, that...
02:43:58 Okay, you went to a party?
02:44:00 And you invited the United States government?
02:44:02 In part of the enemy?
02:44:03 Maybe a little friend?
02:44:05 I did, I can't get enough of them.
02:44:07 God, Ben, do you remember when I, your truly little friend, N.Y.A., were forced...
02:44:14 Forced a third party to get buffalo wings on Halloween.
02:44:18 I did, I do.
02:44:19 And you know what?
02:44:20 It was cruel and unusual.
02:44:22 Yeah, because with tooth decay, Albert fucked that horse and he went away.
02:44:28 Nay, nay, whip, nay, nay.
02:44:31 Oh, you died to hit those.
02:44:32 You died to hit them.
02:44:33 Even if you jump up into them, even if you jump up into them, you die by the way.
02:44:36 Well, I should probably consider it then.
02:44:38 Yeah.
02:44:39 Don't you jump up into that?
02:44:40 The thing that you would do?
02:44:41 Yes.
02:44:42 Wait, what?
02:44:43 Okay, good job.
02:44:44 Could you just touch it, period?
02:44:46 Yeah.
02:44:47 Who's Ben?
02:44:48 What do you think we're trying to do here?
02:44:49 What are we trying to do here?
02:44:50 Ben's trying to get all the nukes.
02:44:51 Like, there's one.
02:44:52 Ben has such a blue or his.
02:44:53 There's one.
02:44:54 There's one.
02:44:55 There's one.
02:44:56 There's one.
02:44:57 I got one.
02:44:58 Ben's such a kind of person who doesn't try to get all the nukes.
02:45:00 Always conduct operations and act in ways that are in line with the emancipating outlook
02:45:06 and goals of the revolution.
02:45:08 Yeah.
02:45:09 And turn the barbaric actions of the enemy against him.
02:45:11 To win greater forces for the revolution.
02:45:14 Including those who come over from the ranks of the enemy.
02:45:17 Oh, yeah.
02:45:18 So we'll be a forgiving god.
02:45:20 Yeah.
02:45:21 We'll let them.
02:45:22 We're going to go Julius Caesar.
02:45:23 We're not going to kill the people who we probably should kill.
02:45:26 And it worked out really good for him.
02:45:29 Combining strategic direction and coordination for the fight as a whole.
02:45:34 With decentralized actions and initiative by local units and leaders.
02:45:38 Relying on mass support, the intelligence this provides for the revolution.
02:45:42 And the denial of intelligence to the enemy.
02:45:44 Counter the enemy's efforts to find, fix, and annihilate revolutionary leadership and
02:45:49 key fighting units.
02:45:50 Rapidly replace forces and leaders that are lost.
02:45:53 Continue to train and deploy new forces and leaders.
02:45:56 Yeah.
02:45:57 It's going in one or not the other at this point.
02:45:59 Um.
02:46:00 No.
02:46:01 Listen.
02:46:02 Dude.
02:46:03 Dude.
02:46:04 We got to replenish our leaders.
02:46:05 Directly hinder the relation between this all out fight and the situation, including
02:46:10 the character and level of revolutionary struggle.
02:46:13 Struggle in countries to the south and the north.
02:46:16 Let's struggle like this.
02:46:18 All right.
02:46:19 This is the final point.
02:46:20 What time is it?
02:46:21 How did I make it?
02:46:22 How did I get through?
02:46:23 I don't understand.
02:46:24 Just walk through.
02:46:25 Are you fucking dumb?
02:46:26 Just walk through.
02:46:27 Wait, it blocked me.
02:46:28 It blocked me.
02:46:29 No.
02:46:30 No, dude.
02:46:31 No.
02:46:32 Then why is it a yellow barrier if I can just walk through it?
02:46:33 Sure.
02:46:34 This is how to defeat the America.
02:46:36 This is the final step.
02:46:37 How to defeat him?
02:46:38 Yeah.
02:46:39 When the quote unquote balance of forces has shifted in favor of the revolution, conduct
02:46:45 operations aimed at achieving final victory.
02:46:47 Oh, I see.
02:46:48 While continuing to quote unquote calibrate these operations so that the decisive encounters
02:46:53 are still avoided until the forces of the old order have been brought to the brink of
02:46:57 total defeat.
02:46:58 And then fully, finally, rout and dismantle the Romanian enemy force.
02:47:02 That's how we win.
02:47:03 Did he put calibrate in quotes?
02:47:04 Yes.
02:47:05 Why?
02:47:06 Quote unquote calibrate.
02:47:07 Calibrate them.
02:47:08 That means they won't know that we're fucking our chances of winning.
02:47:13 Okay.
02:47:14 If they knew that, then that would just be a disaster.
02:47:17 In case it was lost upon you, let me read what the final action is.
02:47:22 When the quote unquote balance of forces has shifted in favor of the revolution, conduct
02:47:28 operations aimed at achieving final victory.
02:47:30 So when we're about to win.
02:47:33 Win.
02:47:34 Win.
02:47:35 Win.
02:47:36 Win.
02:47:37 Win.
02:47:38 Win.
02:47:39 Win.
02:47:40 Win.
02:47:41 Win.
02:47:42 Win.
02:47:43 Win.
02:47:44 Win.
02:47:45 Win.
02:47:46 Win.
02:47:47 Win.
02:47:48 Win.
02:47:49 Win.
02:47:50 Win.
02:47:51 Win.
02:47:52 Win.
02:47:53 Win.
02:47:54 Win.
02:47:55 Win.
02:47:56 Win.
02:47:57 Win.
02:47:58 Win.
02:47:59 Win.
02:48:00 Win.
02:48:01 Win.
02:48:02 Win.
02:48:03 Win.
02:48:04 Win.
02:48:05 Win.
02:48:06 Win.
02:48:07 Win.
02:48:08 If we call all the steps, if we try to win, and then we do win, and then we do things
02:48:20 in accordance with things that we've caused us to have and for them to lose, then maybe
02:48:25 you will win.
02:48:26 We might.
02:48:27 I would be how it would go down well if we conduct operations that will lead to us having a final victory
02:48:33 And then the tide and the balance of forces
02:48:37 Indicate that the revolutionary all that fighting force may win then indeed
02:48:41 I think that we have a good chance of
02:48:43 So you mean that if we perform actions that are in line with winning and the other side
02:48:49 Losing and we stick to those actions of winning which will put us at an advantage to win
02:48:53 And then when we see the goal in sight we continue to try and win
02:48:58 Obviously that we might win like you're saying like obviously
02:49:01 Can you guys put in other words, please?
02:49:08 We got it in the bag we solved all the problems
02:49:11 This is an actual
02:49:14 Unironic
02:49:15 endorsed sponsored paid for ad by the revolutionary communist party of America not a joke
02:49:22 They actually paid us to do this like for real like we are members of that political party
02:49:27 We are we are war criminals
02:49:29 We are literally war criminals because we've read those steps allowed if you read them loud
02:49:33 Then you plans that you are actually doing it get that make it right now you

02:52:03 I'll tell the story. Yeah, please they were turned around
02:52:06 But when we were in the line for Panera bread, there was a father and a mother and like two or three daughters
02:52:13 And one of the daughters just like if he's I don't know what happened
02:52:17 The guy said that she was like fiddling with his watch or something
02:52:20 But the father of this young child how how much like it's like
02:52:26 She's probably like between six and eight. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, she looks so right
02:52:32 and he like
02:52:36 Shows her and like like on the forehead like yeah, yeah like that and like
02:52:42 Does that turn she like falls back and like falls into the mother's like arms
02:52:53 Kid like in the line of Panera bread the guy behind the counter was like what what like he came out
02:52:59 Yeah, like do something about it, but he didn't fucking do shit
02:53:02 Yeah, and the mom was like what the hell are you doing? And the dad was just like
02:53:07 Shoes shoes mess with my watch. Yeah, and they like all the whole family ran out of the store. Yeah

02:53:20 Yeah, did you yeah, I did I was like get this guy out of here
02:53:25 Okay, it was okay
02:53:27 Well, what I want to hone in on that is is what I found most striking and that's that like the mom
02:53:34 Seemed like so unbelievably surprised like as if it were strange what it which it is
02:53:41 Yeah, well, I just think to myself, okay
02:53:44 You know there are people who are abusive and there are people who are not and you know if you if you're like an abusive dad
02:53:49 You probably have done it before and you are probably will do it again. It's like, you know
02:53:53 An unfortunate thing you are just a bad guy a bad guy
02:53:56 But what if you just you know, we're married to someone completely normal like upstanding person like, you know
02:54:03 A good guy then just one day you're in Panera one day. He enlists around
02:54:11 Obliterate your kid
02:54:14 I mean, I saw the woman. I mean she was outraged. I mean if this had been going on a lot for a while or
02:54:20 You know you'd be outraged either way

02:55:10 You know, you know
02:55:14 What that Instagram, you know, you know, yeah, do you know what you're talking about when people send
02:55:22 Like selfies and smoking dope when people send selfies and they
02:55:27 They do a peace sign over their mouth
02:55:29 I think I have because they don't want to show off there like this area. Why wouldn't they want to show off that area?
02:55:35 What's wrong with that area?
02:55:37 Okay, I don't know why you'd be self-conscious about that specifically
02:55:42 I think part of it is trying to be like out of cute in a way. I think it's part of it. Yeah, I
02:55:49 Okay
02:55:52 People on Twitter people on Twitter, maybe you want to die. Yeah, you show me like like tweets from this person
02:55:59 You know, that's like it's it's it's frankly say the name
02:56:04 I
02:56:07 Literally don't know but it's like stuff like wow. I'm so horny right now. I'm so desperate
02:56:13 I'm so sad and depressed
02:56:16 Also, I'm horny right now. I'm depressed like the same he was he had depression
02:56:26 He had to fucking know one
02:56:30 So it's like
02:56:33 I just hate people being desperate on the internet. It's such a bad look
02:56:40 Yeah, definitely and he probably knows that it's a bad look, but he just can't help
02:56:45 Fine. Yeah. Yeah, somehow. It's worse. Yeah, cuz I like expected it. Let's see. Oh, is it here?
02:56:52 Oh, I didn't look like it knew it. Okay. Well, whatever
02:56:57 but it's I
02:57:00 Hate seen okay. This is like this isn't like like a like a ha ha much. He hates that's thing
02:57:05 This is I this is feel separate in my mind. So it probably is in reality as well
02:57:09 I think you might I heard that I
02:57:12 What when I see man himself like I don't know
02:57:16 It's so it's unbecoming when people are so like desperate on Twitter and like God, you know, I'm so bad
02:57:24 I'm so gross God. No one will love me. It's just a fucking nightmare. It's so bad
02:57:29 It's such so terrible
02:57:34 I think I think we'd have to be to play
02:57:36 Sick that was great. What a nightmare. Good. I'm so happy. I'm off Twitter. It's it makes it made my life so much fucking better
02:57:45 Now I don't have to deal with that. It's it's so like it was such a
02:57:50 Glory situation because like I stop and I did literally don't care doesn't impact my life at all
02:57:56 It really did not make any difference
02:58:00 Yeah
02:58:03 You know, I said I said this in the last hour of decay last hour of decay was in
02:58:09 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was I said this in the last episode
02:58:13 I really want to get back into like being online and social media in a way that is like
02:58:19 Yeah, like in a way that is actually I feel constructive
02:58:22 Where I actually instead of just like Twitter. What do you do out of Twitter?
02:58:26 You like on people you yell at people you like
02:58:30 Maybe maybe see an art and it's wrapped up. You're lucky if you're lucky and it's in the worst possible
02:58:37 Format for art. So it's not even like it's like a good place to do that. No, I do not want to look at art on a website where I cannot
02:58:45 Very meticulously archive it. Yeah
02:58:49 Which is why I like yeah tumbler. It wasn't always like this but tumbler right now

03:05:01 It was like some like raid event whatever. Yeah, labris china labris
03:05:06 We invited Ben out it started at like what was 11?
03:05:11 He I get there like 12 30 at 12 30. Yeah, this happens every single time every single time. Yeah, so our community day a lot
03:05:19 And he's always there
03:05:21 We haven't done it in a while. You didn't hang out with me when I came into the city for the yang rally
03:05:25 I couldn't why are you such a bully? I couldn't
03:05:28 I don't have a bully anyway
03:05:30 So I believe that one. I think myself listen. I have the power in my hands. I know what to do and so I told you
03:05:38 Today we were going to meet at 11 for lunch. We were actually gonna meet at 12
03:05:44 12 30. Yeah
03:05:45 Well, then why did you then why did you tell me not to come? No, I I I I said that we were we had just met
03:05:52 And then it would probably take you a long time to get there
03:05:55 I said, okay. What look I I I messaged you at noon and I was like, hey, sorry
03:06:01 Like, you know, I I didn't set an alarm. Well, hold on. Wait. Okay. Like is it too late? Like should I not come and you're like

03:06:12 Wait, hold on. I could I told you it would take me like an hour to get there. Yeah, and we would have been done
03:06:16 Yeah, we would have been done with our stuff. No, that's wrong because you guys didn't get here until like four
03:06:22 Maybe three
03:06:24 Okay, well past two 30 we may have taken our time
03:06:27 But I don't I don't think that would have been worth it genuinely. All right, maybe no
03:06:31 I think that we would have been just in with our food and then walking around
03:06:35 Mmm. Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's probably that's probably the case. That is probably the case
03:06:41 But anyway, the point is is that I lied to you and the lie didn't succeed. So I'm really upset with you. Yeah
03:06:46 Hell yeah
03:06:50 What lying I want to start telling you

03:11:33 I I know that he doesn't deserve to play the game
03:11:35 In fact, I've created a brand new funk called ban under which I ban people from joining a gang specifically for star party
03:11:42 That's the only reason I didn't so that he's forced to live the life of permanent juby because I hate him that much
03:11:47 Wait, what does he do?
03:11:49 He's like kevin too
03:11:50 Well, what's up?

03:12:00 Like steals from like loot crates or something or like like the the
03:12:04 Okay, the people have like piles of items in there in their gang base. Yeah, so people just like like enlist the other team

03:13:52 Pair up trucks
03:13:54 Ever on the pcp
03:13:56 Our heyday is 2016 because that's one thing for me. That's that's what everyone that's when you were releasing
03:14:02 Vapers. No, I wasn't were you not? No, when were you listening? I never consistently released papers. I always
03:14:08 I don't I don't I'm always waited until the chapter. No, I don't I don't mean like that
03:14:12 I mean is in uh, it was the oh my god, Ben's doing like a comic. He's not anymore anymore
03:14:16 He's making like comics and he's he's been on this like new podcast
03:14:20 That's like in like it's a fucking infancy like a sub 20 episodes. I'm not saying that you were releasing the consistently
03:14:26 I'm saying that they were like a new thing that you've done the rock. That's true
03:14:29 Everything was new things were exciting
03:14:31 It was like a breath, you know
03:14:32 It was the end of an era of a pony area of a pony area in which ponies reside
03:14:37 And it was coming into like a brand new like glossing board into a new era of things under which we were doing art that we had never done before
03:14:45 Yeah, that's long since past. Yeah
03:14:47 Now it's about fucking series
03:14:49 It's about maintained in part of the creative and which is good in its own way, but we aren't we haven't captured
03:14:56 That's awful. Yeah, you know what honestly, Ben? It really sucks. It's dumb. That's stupid
03:15:00 And I am ashamed that it's even part of good situation. Uh, yeah, everything sucks
03:15:06 Yeah, you know, I want to get into that actually in a second though, but just to continue on the hippo train
03:15:10 That was the best time because we were releasing new things
03:15:13 But we got the stagger you were just releasing the same stuff over and over
03:15:16 I mean hippo himself had like the hypocrite show which like, you know
03:15:19 I liked the hypocrite show when it was a thing and you know, it was released
03:15:22 But like, you know, it's a video game review show. Yeah, how like hip and fresh can that be?
03:15:27 hip was a funny guy, but like, you know
03:15:30 Frankly, not that cool of a thing to do video game reviews and I'm sure he'd agree with that. I mean, I think that's why he stopped doing it
03:15:36 It's why he stopped doing it
03:15:38 But this jailbabe animation
03:15:40 Jailbabe is going on for a while now, but you have this amount to have this amount of effort
03:15:46 Put into this genuinely
03:15:48 I'm gonna I want to say that to the day. Oh, by the way, Ben. This is the worst level
03:15:52 And you're gonna want to scream that
03:15:54 I already want to scream dude. It's so terrible. That's what you're gonna look like by the time
03:16:02 Um, I mean, what do I have to do? You just no, just figure it out. Just figure it out
03:16:07 That's gonna be just passed a mini-kip by the way
03:16:10 So
03:16:11 What of it?
03:16:13 um, anyway
03:16:15 Yeah, this amount of effort put into like an animation
03:16:19 There's so much fucking creativity. It's almost like he's an artist. It's almost like he's a real artist. He's a real ass artist
03:16:26 Hippo Craig
03:16:27 Easily the most alpha PCP member that there fucking is this guy's got a real ass creative job

03:16:38 It has for that fucking studio and on his side like do like while doing like actual real work
03:16:43 I'm sure he's a lot of time

03:16:52 He has time and a creative juices point in his mind and a passion for the project
03:16:57 Is able to make a three-minute animation in like what like two or four minutes in like what like two months three months
03:17:04 Uh, not sure. Obviously he has had like a lot of time to prepare for it mentally
03:17:09 But just the fact that he was able to do this
03:17:12 This guy is fucking working. This guy is fucking. This guy has
03:17:18 Real actual creative passion to do more than what he has been doing for the past
03:17:23 He's able to grow and evolve and the best part about it is that he's honing skills that he's always had
03:17:29 You know in the long past
03:17:30 Tall man world tallest man fish at the door

03:19:37 Anyway, all that to say, donate to that fucking punk plushie.
03:19:40 He's been wanting to do this Kickstarter for so fucking long.
03:19:43 He's got, if you want to give him money, but you don't want to spend all the money for a plushie,
03:19:49 he's also doing art commissions for the first year.
03:19:54 Yeah.
03:19:55 So he wants the plushie.
03:19:56 He'll get art, and it also says, oh wait, it says, shh, don't tell anyone.
03:19:59 I guess we'll have to look at the Kickstarter to check.
03:20:02 There's a secret in the art commission section.
03:20:04 Ooh.
03:20:05 Ooh.
03:20:06 It says, shh, don't tell anyone.
03:20:08 Ooh, okay.
03:20:09 Well, put the link.
03:20:10 Take a look.
03:20:11 Yeah.
03:20:12 I'm, oh god, that's terrible.
03:20:18 No, that's great.
03:20:19 That's great.
03:20:20 Oh my god.
03:20:21 That's outrageous.
03:20:22 That's outrageous.
03:20:23 That's so controversial.
03:20:24 You have to look.
03:20:25 That's so controversial.
03:20:26 You have to check out the Kickstarter.
03:20:28 That's insane.
03:20:29 You've got to check out the Kickstarter.
03:20:30 Legitimately, that's insane.
03:20:31 I can't believe that's happened.
03:20:32 Why is it insane?
03:20:33 What is it?
03:20:34 You have to click the link then.
03:20:35 You have to click the link then to click the link.
03:20:36 All right.
03:20:37 Well, now my mind is racing with possibilities.
03:20:39 You know what?
03:20:40 Yeah, you know what?
03:20:41 He doesn't click the link.
03:20:42 He doesn't click the link.
03:20:43 Don't be like Ben.
03:20:44 I never click the link.
03:20:45 Don't be like me.
03:20:46 But Ben, okay.
03:20:47 You may not click the link, but have you rang the bell?
03:20:50 Not even once.
03:20:51 Not even once.
03:20:52 How can you ring the bell without putting a subscribe?
03:20:55 Wait, you have to click something.
03:20:57 What?
03:20:58 Well, you rang the bell.
03:20:59 Oh, god.
03:21:00 I rang the bell without subscribing.
03:21:01 I am guilty.
03:21:02 Guilty is charged.
03:21:03 I'm guilty of ringing the bell.
03:21:04 No subscribe now.
03:21:05 What kind of freak?
03:21:06 What kind of freak?
03:21:07 I can't wait for the bell to become meaningless and then for YouTube to not show you notifications
03:21:13 from the bell so they have to come through with the wazoo.
03:21:16 You have to click wazoo in order to get notifications.
03:21:18 I get a YouTube notification for channels that I don't subscribe to.
03:21:22 Yeah, me too.
03:21:23 Notifications on my phone channels that I do not subscribe to.
03:21:27 Fuck yeah dude.
03:21:28 No, no, no, don't follow that pit.
03:21:29 Don't follow that pit.
03:21:30 Do you don't follow that pit?
03:21:31 Don't follow that pit.
03:21:32 You shouldn't be able to follow the pit because you're a ship that is hovering.
03:21:35 Yeah, you're a flying ship.
03:21:37 Off the ground.
03:21:38 No.
03:21:39 You don't understand.
03:21:40 You don't understand.
03:21:41 Is it like you're...
03:21:42 You're a hover ship.
03:21:43 You died.
03:21:44 All right.
03:21:45 You died.
03:21:46 I don't care if I died.
03:21:47 It gives a shit.
03:21:48 You're gonna die again.
03:21:49 So what?
03:21:50 Dine's not good then.
03:21:51 Yes it is.
03:21:52 No.
03:21:53 It means progress is happening.
03:21:55 Look at your little ship right there.
03:21:57 It's little sucks more than anything I've ever seen in my entire life.
03:21:59 This is the only fault of this game is this level.
03:22:02 The only...
03:22:03 The only fault.
03:22:04 You died.
03:22:05 Yeah, because I wanted to have all my health so I wouldn't die on the way.
03:22:09 What a nightmare.
03:22:10 It's called strategy.
03:22:11 It's called fucking being gross.
03:22:14 Yeah.
03:22:16 And...
03:22:17 Disgusting.
03:22:18 Disgusting.
03:22:19 Come on.

03:23:39 Oh my Gosh.
03:23:40 A corpo one person who said he was so stupid.

03:23:47 Hit the things with your ball.

03:23:50 No, no.
03:23:51 The other things.
03:23:52 What other things?
03:23:53 Wow.
03:23:54 Okay how many things on your on screen?
03:23:55 One or two?
03:23:56 Maybe try the one that you didn't do.
03:23:58 do. What, like these things? Yeah. That's it? I just have to destroy all those? Yes. God,
03:24:05 kill me. No, I won't. You have to play more games. Hey, is this game made out of Legos?
03:24:11 Yes. What? God. No. Slam that shit like your dick. Yeah? Yeah. Now you have to blow up
03:24:25 those. Now you have to blow up those. What, those things they were guarding? Yeah. Shoot
03:24:31 it. Shoot it. Shoot it. How flat can you get your penis? Really fucking flat, dude. As flat
03:24:39 as you can even imagine. I don't think that's flat. I'm trying to think right now. If I were
03:24:43 to, like, really, like... If you were to rest... I think it would have maintained its shape pretty
03:24:49 well, actually. Yeah, I think so. If you were to rest your dick... I mean, there's stuff
03:24:53 in there, so there's stuff in there. Yeah, but it squishes. Sure, it squishes. I mean,
03:24:58 provided circumstances. Circumcision. Yeah. Dude, gang, free government circumcision.
03:25:06 Is that true? No, actually, he's anti-circumcision. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Good help. Oh, my
03:25:14 god. I'm sorry, by the way. I'm sorry that they can eat all of your kind. Yeah. My kind?
03:25:19 Yeah. It's fucked up, dude. I don't even have a dick anymore. To be honest, yeah. You know,
03:25:27 whatever. You know, I've never known life without. It's fine. It's fine. Without? Yeah, without.
03:25:33 You've never known life without? Or I guess with. Yeah. It's with... Oh. I've known life
03:25:39 with and without. It's fine. Hell yeah. Yeah. If I was a male with a penis and it was
03:25:46 I would be so... I would be like, unbelievably bad. Well, I can tell you that you would be
03:25:51 way overreacting, because it's NBD, honestly. Like, it's fine. I mean, how would you know?
03:25:57 Uh, because I got fucking circumcised as an adult. What? That's true. That's true. Wait, wait.
03:26:03 Did you not know? Have I not talked about this? No. Yeah, no. What? Yeah, no. I had
03:26:09 so I got circumcised. What? Yeah, what? What's the big deal? What the fuck? What's the big deal?
03:26:19 What are you upset about? I'm not upset about anything. I'm just unparalleledly
03:26:25 surprised, impressed, and intrigued. What? I just told you the whole story. I'm about
03:26:31 to get on the ground and crab walk around so that you will please become a real one.
03:26:36 There are no more details. Pinch me, I'm dreaming. There are no more details to explain. No!
03:26:41 Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Oh my god. Okay, so first of all... There's nothing else to ask.
03:26:48 First of all... I don't think Ben wants to talk about it. No, he's great.
03:26:53 I dare you to come up with one thing that I have not already told you.
03:26:57 So, you had fimosis since you were a child. Yeah. When, like, what age are you talking
03:27:03 about? We're talking adulthood. Like, actual adulthood? Or, like, when you were...
03:27:06 He's always had it. No, no, no, no, no. My force game was just, like, too fucking tight on my dick.
03:27:10 No, no. I mean, when did you get the circumcision? About 18. Before I went to college.
03:27:14 Wow, okay. So, like, you're fucked, bitches. What was... Like, okay. So, you have this thing
03:27:20 wrong with your dick. What is the process of becoming a built-circumcised? Because when
03:27:25 you're a baby, I understand that you... What kind of a stupid question is that? They circumcise
03:27:28 you. You fucking brainless. Not like you... Like, like, what happened to the surgery room?
03:27:31 I mean, do you go to the doctor and you say, hey, can I receive a circumcision? Yeah.
03:27:35 And then they do it for you. Yeah. Just, like, just like that? Yeah.
03:27:39 No, no, no. No religion... No religious? No. Okay. Okay. Okay.
03:27:46 Honestly, the reason I'm pissed now is just that I'm annoyed that anyone found it interesting.
03:27:51 No. Because I don't... I don't think it's that interesting. And they're like, oh, what?
03:27:55 That's interesting, trivia. And my reaction is, ugh, it's not interesting. There's nothing
03:28:00 to talk about. It's not weird, man. Wait, okay, okay. Okay, so you had sex without...
03:28:05 You had sex with the circumcised... Or with the uncircumcised, yes. No, I never had sex
03:28:10 with an uncircumcised... Well, okay, but you felt pleasure from that, you know, before
03:28:14 and you're like... Yes. Yes, I experienced pleasure. You fucking weirdos.
03:28:19 You think that there's no difference? Yeah, there's no difference.
03:28:24 Well, well, okay, cool then. Yeah, it's great. I'm here to sit... Guys, okay, I see people
03:28:30 on, like, line being like, oh, they mutilate, you know, these people are mutilated. People
03:28:36 think it's like, you know, it's fucked up that they do this to kids. They don't even
03:28:39 have consent. I agree. Yeah, you should probably get consent, but... And I'm not even going
03:28:44 to disagree with that. But people are like, you know, if you're circumcised, then you've
03:28:52 been mutilated. You should be angry about this. I know from personal experience that it is
03:28:57 no big deal. Like, it's fine. It's gonna be fine, everyone. There's really nothing to
03:29:03 freak out over. Jump. Oh, god. Stand on the fucking thing. It's gonna be a nightmare.
03:29:11 Stand on the thing. No, you have to do it. That's not true. Okay. What? I did it. No,
03:29:19 you didn't do it right. What do you mean? I stood on the button. Do it. Do it right, dude.
03:29:24 Come on, please. Please. All right. Oh, I see. He knows what's... And he has an
03:29:31 uncircumcised penis, and he knows what's up. And he loves it. Yeah, he knows he has better
03:29:36 sex than anyone else. He knows that Obi-Wan was mutilated. So weird. I'm still intrigued.
03:29:45 I have no more questions to ask. What? Yeah. Listen, you're right. I don't get it. There's
03:29:51 nothing more to add to the situation. There's literally no. It was just such a shock. Because
03:29:56 I've never known anyone who's an adult. I mean, I guess I knew consciously that that was a
03:30:00 thing, but I had never interacted or heard anyone say it ever. No, I know. It's messed up, man.
03:30:05 It's totally fucked up. Yeah, it is fucked up. What the hell is wrong with you? I guess you said
03:30:12 already. What's wrong with you? Just got like fucking a tight-ass foreskin. Well, hey, I got
03:30:20 it. Yeah, it was just tight. I imagine... Okay, you know, you know, Mr. Mon... I'm sorry,
03:30:25 Mon Jr.? Mr. Medeker? Yeah. I love that guy. I love him even more. You know, Mon Jr., how
03:30:31 it has, like, a little, like, weird, like, squiggly little, like, top of its head. Yeah.
03:30:36 And that's what Phymosis Dick looks like at the end, where it's, like, just like a squiggly
03:30:40 little, like, artistic rendition of, like, flaps. Oh. I can't picture what you're talking
03:30:45 about. Yeah. And I don't want to. Yeah, you get it? Yeah, no, I get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
03:30:49 she gets it. If the audience gets it. Oh, gross. Now I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry I said
03:30:55 anything. How is it possible that two members of our glorious show have had Phymosis?
03:31:00 That's, like, a rare, bizarre, like, freak disease, isn't it? I don't think so. Oh, yeah?
03:31:05 Is it normal? Is it normal? I think it's pretty normal. Ooh. Ooh. You learned something.
03:31:10 I'm learning so much right now. Anthony, you could have had it. You never know. Maybe you
03:31:14 had it. Oh, it was for my own good. You don't have to ask your mom. Yeah. Did I have Phymosis?
03:31:20 Did I have Digi Dick? And she would be like, I was waiting for this day to come. Um, what
03:31:25 am I supposed to do? Jump. That's only for a minute, by the way. You don't need to do
03:31:30 that. Okay. Well, I can't, I can't make it. So whatever. There's Emperor Palpatine right
03:31:35 there. It's count, it's count Palpatine. It's Dooku. It's count, count them. Count, count them.
03:31:41 Just hit them with your big old gun. I killed them. Died. Well, soon. Well, she's jumping
03:31:47 all. I'm a deadly warrior. No, he's forcing you. You forced them. You dumbass. I thought,
03:31:54 I thought that was me, uh, force pushing it. Boy, how will I defeat him? Dude, he's like,
03:32:00 his movements are so like, generate when you hit him. It's just like, just fall the fuck
03:32:05 over. It just stands there looking at you. Radiating force power. Oh, this will work.
03:32:10 Oh, shit. Fuck. Okay. No, don't worry. How could I have predicted?
03:32:15 Just standing around. Look at this. Look at these Lego parts. I know. Wait, is he a Lego?
03:32:21 No. Lol. He's not even worried about it. Yeah. Bye. He's just, he's like, he just pats
03:32:30 him down. Oh, dang. Oh my God, Yoda. The most powerful warrior. Time to fight Yoda, guys.
03:32:39 I'm Yoda. Dude, I'm going fucking ballistic. I know. Dude, Yoda goes crazy in his lightsaber.
03:32:45 And I like, actually, though. Dude, yeah. Um, why is it playing the imperial march when
03:32:51 the empire is not formed yet? In fact, this is still in the republic. And these people
03:32:56 have not instituted imperialist elements. They haven't won yet. They haven't. The, the,
03:33:01 the, the, the, the balance of forces has not indicated that Count Palpatine will win. So
03:33:06 I don't understand why they're making measures that would lead to final victory just yet.
03:33:09 What was I, what was I just doing?
03:33:11 Hey, how far into episode two are you going to win? What is it?
03:33:14 I think this is close to the end. I don't know what I, I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.
03:33:18 This is the end. This is the end. Yeah, this is the end.
03:33:20 Thank God. Thank God.
03:33:22 Just hit him. Just hit him.
03:33:23 Well, he, he, he force pushes me away.
03:33:25 Um.
03:33:27 What's, what's the move?
03:33:36 It doesn't, it does no damn. He just had to like to get you. It doesn't matter. He just doesn't.
03:33:43 He just walk around and it's normal.
03:33:45 What am I, what does it want?
03:33:47 Okay. Walk around. Surely there must be, okay. Force that. Force that. Yeah. Wow. Okay.
03:33:56 Shreddish.
03:33:57 No. Okay. Just walk around. Walk around.
03:34:00 Surely, surely there's something around here that you can interact with.
03:34:03 Maybe get that power up or something. You like get that power up, then walk over to him.
03:34:07 I don't think that's going to do it.
03:34:08 I don't know, man.
03:34:09 What?
03:34:10 Oh, okay.
03:34:11 What?
03:34:14 He's popped over.
03:34:16 Why would he do such a thing?
03:34:20 Um, is there a person with a gun?
03:34:23 No. It's just me and Yoda.
03:34:25 Do you, okay. I feel like you have to be two players for this. I feel like you have to.
03:34:31 Oh, maybe, maybe it's.
03:34:34 He's well, he's focused enough.
03:34:36 Oh, I see.
03:34:37 Okay.
03:34:38 All right. Okay. I understood.
03:34:40 It's what, yeah. It's when he's lightning one. You just got to switch.
03:34:44 Lol.
03:34:45 This game is so fun.
03:34:47 It doesn't even do him damage.
03:34:48 Yeah, it does. He takes down the heart.
03:34:50 Did it?
03:34:51 Yeah.
03:34:52 Oh, okay. Wow.
03:34:53 See?
03:34:54 Cool.
03:34:55 Terrible.

03:35:28 I can't believe he said it.
03:35:29 Three play unlawed.

03:35:31 Is that the end?
03:35:32 Yup.
03:35:33 Guys.
03:35:34 Three hours, 30 minutes.
03:35:35 That's a good length to stop at, I think.

03:35:40 Hey.
03:35:41 Hey.
03:35:42 Hey.
03:35:43 It's Craig.
03:35:44 He's offering you bread.
03:35:46 Did you make garlic bread?
03:35:48 Put it in the oven.
03:35:49 Wait.
03:35:50 Oh my God.
03:35:51 How do we eat this?
03:35:52 Oh my God.
03:35:53 I'm not going to have any, but it looks great.
03:35:54 Craig.
03:35:55 Get in front of the camera.
03:35:56 Say goodbye.
03:35:57 No.
03:35:58 Craig.
03:35:59 Where are you going?
03:36:00 I'm going to say goodbye.
03:36:01 Say goodbye to everyone.
03:36:02 Oh no.
03:36:03 Oh no.
03:36:04 Oh no.
03:36:05 We saw him.
03:36:06 He's on the KAA.
03:36:07 He's coming to the crack house tonight, buddy.
03:36:09 It's canon now.
03:36:10 Shut this shit off.
03:36:11 All right.
03:36:12 End of the stream.
03:36:13 I'm going to whip out my dick.
03:36:15 This game's terrible.
03:36:16 Really?
03:36:17 Yeah, I'm going to whip out my dick.
03:36:18 I can't wait to never play Lego Star Wars again.
03:36:20 All right.
03:36:21 All right.
03:36:22 See you guys.
03:36:23 Wait.
03:36:24 I have to close the game.
03:36:25 All right.
03:36:26 Here we go.
03:36:27 It won't let me do it.
03:36:28 It won't let me do it.
03:36:29 It's very unsatisfying.
03:36:30 All right.
03:36:31 I'm going to take it out.
03:36:32 All tab, you dumb fuck.
03:36:33 Yes, sir.
03:36:34 Mr. President, sir.
03:36:35 Take it out.
03:36:36 Take it out.
03:36:37 Take it out.
03:36:38 Take it out.
03:36:39 All right.
03:36:40 Here we go.
03:36:41 Get away from me.
03:36:42 You're stupid.
03:36:43 You're stupid.
03:36:44 I don't like you.
