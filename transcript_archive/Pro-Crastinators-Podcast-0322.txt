00:00:00 I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:03 That son of a bitch.
00:00:04 Son of a bitch.
00:00:05 Son of a bitch.
00:00:06 Son of a bitch.
00:00:07 Son of a bitch.
00:00:08 Son of a bitch.
00:00:09 Son of a bitch.
00:00:10 Son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Son of a bitch.
00:00:12 Son of a bitch.
00:00:13 Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:15 It is me, Ben Saint, and Simsie.
00:00:17 No, it isn't.
00:00:18 It's me, Oblivionfall.
00:00:19 How's it going?
00:00:20 Okay, do it.
00:00:21 Do the Oblivionfall impression, but say something with a TH sound in it.
00:00:29 You can make it an F. No, I literally couldn't think of a single word that had a TH in it.
00:00:41 There aren't any.
00:00:42 It's a trick question.
00:00:43 Something.
00:00:44 I need to go do something.
00:00:49 Does he do that?
00:00:51 Does he do what?
00:00:52 Does he do the THF thing?
00:00:54 Yeah, a little bit.
00:00:56 Okay.
00:00:57 Subscribe to Oblivionfall's Patreon, everybody.
00:01:00 Sorry, Oblivionfall.
00:01:01 Everybody critique Oblivionfall while he isn't around.
00:01:03 Never do that.
00:01:05 Yeah.
00:01:07 The reason why I said, oh my god, and then went silent, and then said fuck softly before
00:01:14 we started recording.
00:01:15 That did alarm me.
00:01:16 That did make me quite frightened.
00:01:18 Well, I was tense because there's a fly in my room, and it is a particularly annoying
00:01:25 one that I have failed to kill for like an entire day now.
00:01:31 He will not land anywhere.
00:01:35 He just won't do it, and I keep losing track of him.
00:01:39 And usually it doesn't take me this long to kill one, but he landed on my gallon jug
00:01:44 with my excess slime in it, and I was like, oh my god, I was going to whack him while
00:01:50 he was on the cap, but he took off again.
00:01:54 Mal, maybe one day you'll find him.
00:01:58 He, he, this is the worst fly ever because he won't land, but he keeps like buzzing my
00:02:05 face.
00:02:06 He keeps buzzing like right across my face and in my ear, and like flies usually don't
00:02:11 do that.
00:02:12 Mosquitoes tend to do that more, but he is like aggressive and evasive, and he's big
00:02:17 too.
00:02:18 He's not even like a small one.
00:02:19 He's like a, he's like a good sized house fly.
00:02:22 He's one of the fat, juicy fuckers that buzz around.
00:02:26 He's not like the biggest, but he's, he's, he's big-ish.
00:02:31 He's house fly size.
00:02:32 He's not like one of the little ones.
00:02:34 I've mostly had moths recently, yeah, because of the heat wave means that I kept my window
00:02:40 open at night to try and actually cool down my room for once, and it would just meant
00:02:45 a million moths got in.
00:02:46 So there are about 40 dead moths on my windowsill, and then I think a bunch of spiders got
00:02:52 in as well.
00:02:53 So there's spiders in my corners.
00:02:54 There's one I can see right now just above my bed.
00:02:57 There's one in the lamp shade of my little desktop lamp who's built perfect spider web.
00:03:03 Yeah, I live in a spider hole.
00:03:05 Well now I don't feel quite so bad.
00:03:07 Oh yeah, that's all right.
00:03:09 I mentioned, I mentioned there were fruit flies in my kitchen.
00:03:12 There's have been reduced somewhat because I finally took my garbage out.
00:03:18 So you know, I'm thinking little, taking baby steps.
00:03:21 Mine was more of a migration more than an infestation, I think, because I just sort of left the way
00:03:26 open for them.
00:03:27 I haven't dealt with them yet.
00:03:29 Did I describe the most disgusting thing that I saw in my kitchen a while ago?
00:03:37 It was a...
00:03:38 Was it the coffee thing?
00:03:41 No, no, no.
00:03:43 It was more recent than that.
00:03:44 That was a while ago, like when I moved.
00:03:47 This was...
00:03:48 Okay, I mean someone had, you know, we had mice, so someone laid a mouse trap, a glue trap.
00:03:56 They laid it in the crevice between the fridge and the counter, which has like a couple,
00:04:02 like two inches of space there, which is just wide enough for it to set a glue trap.
00:04:06 And it did catch a mouse.
00:04:09 And you could see it like, you know, it wasn't really under anything.
00:04:13 You could pretty much see it just if you looked in between those.
00:04:15 It was easy to see.
00:04:17 The mouse got caught in the glue trap, laid there and died.
00:04:24 This fly is buzzing right in my face again.
00:04:26 I don't...
00:04:27 This one...
00:04:28 Why does he...
00:04:30 Most of them don't, like, come at me.
00:04:32 This one, like, comes at me and yet and never lands.
00:04:35 And I'm so angry.
00:04:37 I'm so fucking mad at him.
00:04:40 What did I do?
00:04:41 What did I do to be punished like this?
00:04:44 You do not have Febreze that you can use to murder him or something like that.
00:04:47 What do you mean Febreze?
00:04:48 Like a spray?
00:04:49 Well, it stuns them and then you can kill them.
00:04:55 Spraying at that...
00:04:56 Does it?
00:04:57 Yeah, usually.
00:04:58 Like, deodorant or something like that will usually, like, stun a creepy crawly and make
00:05:02 him able to be assaulted by a grown man.
00:05:07 I wonder if I have anything like that.
00:05:09 I have, like, a sprayable sunblock.
00:05:13 No, that's probably not.
00:05:15 I don't think I want to get that, like, all over my room.
00:05:18 It's more like aerosol kind of thing, yeah.
00:05:20 Shaving cream?
00:05:22 Probably won't do it.
00:05:24 It'll keep him in place.
00:05:26 If I hit him, yeah.
00:05:28 Yeah.
00:05:29 Um...
00:05:30 Okay, okay, but anyway, this mouse died on the glue trap and then before I noticed it,
00:05:37 he became infested with maggots and then the maggots crawled out of his body and also
00:05:44 got caught on the glue trap.
00:05:47 So the glue trap was covered not only with a dead mouse, but also with dead maggots.
00:05:51 Were there any maggots feeding on the corpse of the maggot?
00:05:55 Yeah, smaller maggots, based out of the...
00:06:01 It was very...
00:06:02 It was horrible.
00:06:03 Yeah, that was the sound.
00:06:05 It was very gross.
00:06:07 I don't think I've ever encountered a maggot in my life.
00:06:10 I don't think I've ever had to come to terms with the fact that those exist by seeing them.
00:06:16 Oh my god, I got it.
00:06:19 You got the fly?
00:06:20 I got the fly.
00:06:21 Did you get him or if you caught him?
00:06:23 No, I killed him.
00:06:25 He's dead.
00:06:26 He's dead, okay.
00:06:28 Seriously, he's been buzzing my face since last night.
00:06:32 I had to go to sleep knowing that he was around because I just couldn't catch him.
00:06:39 He was flying near my feet like on the floor.
00:06:43 He wasn't landing.
00:06:44 So I picked up my writing tablet, my soft paper notebook and I laid it out flat and I threw
00:06:50 it at the ground hoping to intercept the space between it and the floor and catch him in
00:06:57 it and it worked.
00:06:58 It worked.
00:07:00 I just hydraulic pressed that man.
00:07:03 I've done that.
00:07:05 This is not the first time that I've killed a fly not by like whacking it when it lands
00:07:10 but like by throwing something at it when it is in flight.
00:07:15 It happens.
00:07:17 It can work.
00:07:18 You know what's perfect?
00:07:19 A slipper smack.
00:07:21 Slippers, for some reason, some of the way the design have the perfect momentum and speed
00:07:25 to accelerate fast enough to destroy any fucking bug.
00:07:29 I have whacked a fly with a slipper before.
00:07:32 I have done that, yeah.
00:07:34 It's nothing that makes you feel more like a cartoon character than doing that.
00:07:38 First you feel like walking around in like a dressing counter to take off your slipper
00:07:41 and kill a bug with this slipper.
00:07:44 There is something that makes me feel more like a cartoon character than that and I did
00:07:48 it at my last house and that was no two houses ago.
00:07:51 Was it rolled up newspaper?
00:07:52 No.
00:07:54 I killed a mouse with a frying pan.
00:07:56 Yes, there we go.
00:07:58 I literally did that.
00:08:02 Rolled up newspaper would be pretty good.
00:08:04 Rolling panes is another good contender.
00:08:07 But again, just like this fly, I killed that mouse not by whacking it with a held frying
00:08:12 pan but by dropping a frying pan at it on the ground.
00:08:17 You killed that little motherfucker from above.
00:08:20 What the hell?
00:08:21 You killed that little motherfucker from above my fucker, yeah.
00:08:24 I didn't like it.
00:08:25 I didn't like it.
00:08:26 Mice are, I mean, mice are kind of cute.
00:08:29 Yeah, that's the...
00:08:30 It's kind of, yeah, it's a bit of a bug.
00:08:32 I mean, I don't like them living in my kitchen but they're kind of cute when you look at them
00:08:37 so it's not really fun to kill them.
00:08:39 They're just extra pets for me to keep them.
00:08:42 They like poop on the counter.
00:08:46 Ew.
00:08:48 Yeah, sometimes in the corners I find mouse poop and I'm like, well, that's not cute.
00:08:53 That cancels out any affinity I might have had.
00:08:58 It's pretty annoying how everything on this fucking planet needs to shit brown goo everywhere.
00:09:04 At least mouse poop is, it's almost hard to even spot, which kind of makes it worse because
00:09:10 it could be anywhere and I might not even notice it.
00:09:12 But it's very hard, dry, little like tiny little pellets, like smaller than a grain of rice.
00:09:18 Yeah, they look like tiny little black roses, don't they?
00:09:22 Yeah, they do.
00:09:24 And so they're kind of innocuous but like when I notice them and I realize what they are,
00:09:29 I'm like, god, fucking, god damn it.
00:09:33 Those mice have been shitting on my property again.
00:09:36 They've been eating my scraps and then pooping them back out at me.
00:09:43 And that's just disrespectful.
00:09:46 It's not the nicest thing.
00:09:48 No.
00:09:50 No, I'm going to disagree with you.
00:09:52 I think it's the nicest thing.
00:09:54 I think it's the coolest, sweetest thing is that mice leave you little presents all over the floor.
00:10:00 Yeah.
00:10:02 Haven't caught any more.
00:10:04 Only caught that one.
00:10:06 Only caught like two mice in these traps.
00:10:08 I know there still are some, but there are less than there were before, so that's good.
00:10:12 See, I can't even comprehend like killing a mouse because I've never had mouse infestation.
00:10:18 So if a mouse showed up in my room today, I would probably hide it from my family and keep it.
00:10:24 Put it in like a little cardboard box and feed it every night.
00:10:28 Yeah, at that other house two houses ago, they were a bit of an infestation in the kitchen.
00:10:33 They were really annoying and they are even worse one.
00:10:36 I would say they are a worse infestation here at this house.
00:10:39 So, yeah, I really, I never had mice as a kid.
00:10:44 I would see cartoons with a little mouse hole in the wall and be like, lol, what the fuck?
00:10:50 Oh, Jerry kind of actually based.
00:10:53 Garfield.
00:10:55 Garfield won't kill the mice.
00:10:57 That's funny. Garfield's lazy and fat.
00:11:00 I hate that.
00:11:03 Who wrote this unlikable fat character?
00:11:07 Was it J.K. Rowling? Right Garfield?
00:11:11 Trying to make me hate fat people?
00:11:14 By making them not kill mice?
00:11:16 Davis, I don't know.
00:11:18 J.K. Davis.
00:11:20 Blue's legend.
00:11:23 Blue's legend J.K. Fats Rowling or Davis, whatever.
00:11:29 Right, Garfield and Dobby and Hagrid.
00:11:34 I was thinking about that slavery thing in Harry Potter.
00:11:44 Yeah.
00:11:46 It's fun to think about, isn't it?
00:11:49 As a kid, I mean, I wanted to defend myself a little bit because I like those books a lot as a kid.
00:11:57 You were on the side of slavery as a kid, you will say.
00:12:00 Well, of course. I mean, they like it.
00:12:03 They like it. They do like it.
00:12:05 It's in the text. If you read the text you analyze it, it says that they enjoy it.
00:12:10 There's nothing wrong with it.
00:12:12 It literally is. And as a kid, I did not connect it to any real world thing.
00:12:17 I kind of just was like, I guess these slaves, I guess they like being slaves.
00:12:22 So that's weird. That's wacky, but okay.
00:12:25 Isn't that magical and whimsical?
00:12:27 It's magical and whimsical.
00:12:30 This is a magical fantasy world where slaves love their masters.
00:12:33 Okay, it's good.
00:12:35 It's literally Pokemon. We love Pokemon.
00:12:37 Everybody loves Pokemon because you enslave these sentient creatures and make them battleship.
00:12:41 But it's okay because they love it.
00:12:43 Oh, no, because it lets them reach their full potential.
00:12:45 It's literally the same thing.
00:12:47 Hippocrates.
00:12:49 Anybody who hates Harry Potter now because of the horrible things that J.K. Rowling has written and said
00:12:56 and likes Pokemon, you are a fraught and a faker.
00:13:02 Hippocrates. Shigeru Miyamoto.
00:13:05 Shigeru Miyamoto loves slavery and hates trans people just as much. Look at him.
00:13:10 Did you ever see like the leak from Nintendo?
00:13:12 I can't remember if it's like fake or not, but it was something like that.
00:13:14 Apparently whenever they would get people to work overtime at Nintendo, Miyamoto would walk in and say it's Mario time.
00:13:20 And then they would know that that meant they had to stay an extra four hours to crunch for a video game.
00:13:24 It's Mario time?
00:13:26 Yeah, apparently.
00:13:28 I don't remember where I saw that, but I don't think it's true, but I just thought it was funny.
00:13:32 I don't think I've ever heard that.
00:13:34 I think I did hear that he would like...
00:13:38 I think I did hear that he would just kind of like walk into people's cubicles and like fuck around with them.
00:13:44 Like he would just kind of wander in and out of the office at will and just like distract people.
00:13:50 Yeah.
00:13:52 I can't remember who it was.
00:13:54 There were some really early like Western developers that were working at Nintendo of Japan.
00:13:58 I saw it in like a documentary on Netflix about video games.
00:14:02 It wasn't very good, but it was narrated by Charles Martinet, so I watched the whole thing.
00:14:06 No.
00:14:08 There was a bit where they were just talking about the weird attitudes that Miyamoto had where he put them in like a tiny office on the other side of the building from all the Japanese workers.
00:14:16 And he would come in and just go like, you okay?
00:14:18 And they go, yeah, and then he wouldn't look at any of the work you're doing.
00:14:22 Just leave or something like that.
00:14:24 Oh, that's the dream.
00:14:26 It is.
00:14:28 I can't remember what they were working on, but...
00:14:30 Hmm.
00:14:32 Interesting.
00:14:34 Anyway, Harry Potter.
00:14:36 Yeah.
00:14:38 I said that in the worst way possible.
00:14:40 I was just thinking, I just want to say, I didn't love slavery as a kid.
00:14:48 Harry Potter didn't make me love slavery.
00:14:50 I just didn't think about it.
00:14:52 I just love slavery, but I love Harry Potter.
00:14:54 I swear, I swear, I didn't love slavery.
00:14:58 It didn't make me think, oh, slavery is based, actually.
00:15:02 Yeah.
00:15:04 I would say that I don't think Harry Potter has instilled any poor values on me.
00:15:10 I don't think so.
00:15:12 Not directly.
00:15:14 I am actually immune to propaganda.
00:15:18 So in my opinion, it just doesn't work on me.
00:15:22 It would simply not be influenced.
00:15:24 It's like you're a grass type being hit by a grass type move.
00:15:28 It just doesn't work because you always use propaganda yourself.
00:15:30 That's right.
00:15:34 You can't use stunts for.
00:15:36 At least not in generation.
00:15:38 I was going to say you can't get hurt by dragon type moves
00:15:42 because you use dragon type moves, but that's wrong, isn't it?
00:15:44 That's the opposite.
00:15:46 That's the opposite of what's true, yeah.
00:15:48 I don't fucking know Pokemon.
00:15:50 I know Hagrid.
00:15:52 I know who Hagrid is.
00:15:54 Are you not actually familiar with the source material?
00:16:00 With Harry Potter.
00:16:02 No, no, yeah. I've read them.
00:16:04 I've read them. I've watched them. I know.
00:16:06 I haven't watched them.
00:16:08 I've watched the first four movies, I think.
00:16:10 See, I'm a different generation than you.
00:16:12 So I started with the movies.
00:16:14 Yeah, yeah.
00:16:16 I think the first Harry Potter thing I saw was the beginning of the sixth movie.
00:16:22 I watched it with my dad.
00:16:24 No, I watched the whole sixth movie with no context from any of the previous ones.
00:16:28 And then we went to Citrus and saw the seventh.
00:16:31 Then I watched all the ones previous and then we went and saw the eighth.
00:16:34 That's so funny.
00:16:36 I know.
00:16:38 I saw the first movie in theater.
00:16:40 I think I saw the first two or three.
00:16:42 Yeah.
00:16:44 And I just got sick of them.
00:16:46 I just didn't care after a while.
00:16:48 I was scared of them as a kid, so I didn't watch any of them until
00:16:51 that's so funny.
00:16:53 Until I was like 13.
00:16:55 I was scared of fucking everything as a child.
00:16:57 At 13, really?
00:16:59 Yeah, I was fucking terrified.
00:17:01 I didn't fucking...
00:17:03 I think I was like year eight or year seven or something.
00:17:05 Must have been around then.
00:17:07 I mean, I was going to say, I was scared.
00:17:09 You probably never...
00:17:11 You probably did not have a Nintendo entertainment system.
00:17:15 You probably started with like the GameCube or some shit.
00:17:19 Like Spokes, even worse.
00:17:21 Yeah.
00:17:23 So, yeah, on the NES, there was a game called Star Tropics.
00:17:29 And there were caves, you know, to explore and battle in.
00:17:34 And some of the caves were like shaped like a skull.
00:17:38 And that scared the shit out of me.
00:17:41 The skull cave scared the shit out of me.
00:17:44 This was when I was like seven.
00:17:46 Six or seven or something.
00:17:49 So, I feel like I have an excuse.
00:17:52 Do you remember just like really bad like disc PC games?
00:17:56 That whole like early 2000s era of really bad ones.
00:18:00 We had the one that was like zoo vet.
00:18:04 And it was just like really weird like semi pixel art, semi like realistic painting things of animals.
00:18:10 And you just like dragged like needles into them and like sewed them up and stuff.
00:18:15 Like zoo vet.
00:18:17 Yeah, I don't know.
00:18:19 Like a zoological veterinarian.
00:18:23 That kind of thing.
00:18:25 I looked up screenshots of it.
00:18:28 Is that a game?
00:18:30 I don't remember what it was called, but it was something like that.
00:18:32 There are games called zoo vet that come up when you Google it.
00:18:36 There's a bunch.
00:18:38 So, I'm not sure which one.
00:18:40 I'm going to have a look even though I'm scared.
00:18:43 It looked pretty bad.
00:18:45 My sister used to play it and I would hide behind her and cry when the monkey was being sewed back together.
00:18:52 I mean, did it show like surgery?
00:18:55 Yeah, it showed like gooey bits.
00:18:57 I think it was this.
00:19:00 Hang on.
00:19:01 Here's a screenshot of a lion getting shit on his asshole.
00:19:04 What?
00:19:06 No.
00:19:07 It was this kind of thing.
00:19:09 It was like bad 3D renders.
00:19:12 Oh, that's gross.
00:19:14 Yeah, it is.
00:19:16 I know there was one where you opened the monkey's chest and that one really upset me.
00:19:23 Yeah, I could see how it would.
00:19:25 That one scared me.
00:19:27 That was an early video game scaring experience.
00:19:30 The whole vibe of Rayman 2 freaked me out even though I really liked it as well.
00:19:37 Of Rayman 2?
00:19:39 Yeah, that game's just weird and dark and strange.
00:19:43 Just the aesthetic of it really creeped me out.
00:19:45 I was a big, big pussy.
00:19:47 I don't think you understand.
00:19:49 Which one's Rayman 2?
00:19:51 Oh, the 3D one?
00:19:53 Yeah.
00:19:55 I'm not familiar with that one.
00:19:57 There was a level at the end where it has a place like a fucking scary horror movie that clips the audio and it freaked shit out me.
00:20:04 Everything was strange and French and I didn't like it.
00:20:07 I was terrified as good.
00:20:09 You know, when you say it like that, it makes sense.
00:20:12 I was scared of Hieronymus Bosch paintings as a child.
00:20:18 Those are meant to be creepy and scary and off-putting.
00:20:23 I guess it's probably not that weird.
00:20:28 What else scared me as a child?
00:20:31 To this day, I can't watch horror movies.
00:20:34 I don't like the emotions that they deliberately set out to evoke.
00:20:41 I was obsessively, massively squeamish when I was younger, which I've sort of overcome.
00:20:46 But it would even be things like in the Star Wars prequels at the end when Anakin gets burned in lava.
00:20:52 I would fucking scream and run away from the screen because I thought it was gross that his skin was coming off and was burning.
00:21:00 It is gross.
00:21:02 Yeah, but if you look at the effect, it's just a guy with black shit all over his face.
00:21:08 I mean, sure.
00:21:10 I was...
00:21:12 Oh fuck, I just had...
00:21:16 I didn't watch the Nightmare Before Christmas until I was in high school because I thought it looked creepy and scary.
00:21:25 I think I saw a clip from it, maybe from a commercial where the doctor pops his head open and rubs his brain.
00:21:38 And there's the part where the real-world kid opens the present that Jack left him and he pulls out a shrunken head.
00:21:47 And that scared the shit out of me.
00:21:50 Actually, I misremembered it.
00:21:52 I misremembered it as the kid pulls the head out of the box and the head starts screaming.
00:21:58 The head does not start screaming in the movie, but I imagined that it did and that thought terrified me.
00:22:06 Did you ever have something that creeped you out as a kid, like a movie where the whole general thing you found unsettling, but you couldn't stop watching it?
00:22:15 You were obsessed with it.
00:22:18 Something I was creeped and unsettled by.
00:22:21 But you really enjoyed it and wanted to keep revisiting it?
00:22:28 Maybe.
00:22:29 Think of an example off the top of my head at the moment.
00:22:33 There was a terrible live-action Pinocchio movie that we had on VHS.
00:22:38 And, you know, Pinocchio, it has weird shit in it like when the kids turn into donkeys and this had a particularly bad version of that.
00:22:46 Was it live-action?
00:22:47 Yeah.
00:22:49 I don't know when it was made, but there we go.
00:22:51 There's a screenshot of that moment.
00:22:53 Oh, dear.
00:22:54 Let's see it.
00:22:59 No good.
00:23:00 This was something I was obsessed with as a kid.
00:23:02 I just watched that movie over and over again.
00:23:05 It's pretty weird, but I can just about manage the scary bits.
00:23:09 Even Pinocchio himself was very fucked looking.
00:23:13 It looks like a puppet.
00:23:16 He really does look like a puppet.
00:23:18 Oh, I've seen this.
00:23:20 I mean, I haven't seen this movie.
00:23:22 No, yeah.
00:23:23 I've seen this character.
00:23:25 It was Martin Landau.
00:23:27 What's his face?
00:23:30 Gepetto?
00:23:31 Gepetto, yeah, that's the one.
00:23:33 It's like a bolo.
00:23:35 I was always annoyed when I watched the live-action version.
00:23:37 I was like, why isn't those two guys that try and kidnap him a fox and a cat?
00:23:42 Oh, were they in the Disney version?
00:23:44 Yeah.
00:23:50 I know I must have seen the Disney version at some point in the distant, distant past.
00:23:55 I barely remember it.
00:23:57 It's one of the ones that I watched a lot as a kid.
00:23:59 I guess I had a big Pinocchio phase.
00:24:03 I watched it in the early 2000.
00:24:07 I watched a lot of recorded episodes of Winnie the Pooh on VHS.
00:24:12 That adds up.
00:24:13 That makes a lot of sense.
00:24:15 Yeah.
00:24:17 More so than any particular Disney movie.
00:24:20 Yeah.
00:24:23 That's good shit.
00:24:28 Wait, there was an episode of Winnie the Pooh that creeped me out, actually.
00:24:33 There was one.
00:24:36 It was a New Adventures episode.
00:24:38 It's the episode where Tigger breaks a mirror,
00:24:46 and so he thinks that he'll get seven years bad luck,
00:24:50 but he, through some sort of logical gymnastics,
00:24:55 convinces everyone that no, actually,
00:24:58 technically, Piglet gets the bad luck due to some technicality
00:25:02 in how the mirror-breaking rule works.
00:25:07 So they try to protect Piglet from bad luck,
00:25:12 and at one point,
00:25:16 it's Tigger's thoughtlessness and his carelessness
00:25:19 that keeps inflicting terrible things on Piglet.
00:25:24 He gets what Piglet, yeah.
00:25:26 But they don't realize this, so they keep convincing him,
00:25:29 oh, it's the curse.
00:25:30 It's the bad luck.
00:25:31 Tigger's right.
00:25:32 Piglet did get the bad luck after all.
00:25:34 So at one point, they build him a safe house
00:25:40 to wait out the bad luck in,
00:25:43 and it's like a towering, it's like a creepy tower of rocks
00:25:50 that's long and pointy,
00:25:53 and Tigger puts a lightning rod at the top,
00:25:56 and he thinks a lightning rod is just something that attracts lightning,
00:26:01 and that that's good, and that it's more safe, actually.
00:26:06 He understands that a lightning rod is meant to prevent lightning strikes,
00:26:10 but he doesn't understand how it works,
00:26:12 so he just put a metal rod at the top to attract lightning lights.
00:26:15 That's so stupid.
00:26:18 And therefore, lightning strikes the safe house and explodes it.
00:26:23 And kills Piglet.
00:26:24 And kills Piglet, yeah.
00:26:26 And he has to go to the zoo vet.
00:26:28 Well, it explodes the house,
00:26:32 and Piglet is left sitting at the bottom of it,
00:26:37 and he's completely traumatized by the fact that his house has exploded around him,
00:26:41 and so he's just sitting there, like catatonic,
00:26:44 like staring straight ahead with his mouth twitching,
00:26:47 just going like...
00:26:49 And there's a shot.
00:26:53 You see him after the explosion,
00:26:56 and he's just staring straight into the camera with his mouth twitching,
00:27:01 and then there's a match cut to another scene where Piglet is still sitting there,
00:27:07 staring straight into the camera, mouth twitching,
00:27:09 while poo and rabbit think ponder,
00:27:13 and they walk back and forth behind him,
00:27:15 like, what to do, what to do, what are we going to do about this bad luck curse?
00:27:19 And for like a full minute, Piglet just stares straight into the camera,
00:27:23 catatonic, mouth twitching, and I found it very unsettling.
00:27:30 Because he just looks really, I don't know, scared.
00:27:33 I love little things like that.
00:27:35 And sort of like his face is kind of twisted up in a sort of rictus expression of horror.
00:27:41 There is a lot of them in like cartoons,
00:27:43 like specific little things that probably wouldn't bother anything else,
00:27:47 but always bothered you, you know?
00:27:49 Me?
00:27:50 No, no, like the royal you, you know?
00:27:53 Everybody has one little thing from like a cartoon they loved as a kid that was like,
00:27:58 I didn't like that bit.
00:28:00 I feel like I spent a long time describing that one,
00:28:03 but there was another one, there was an episode of all that.
00:28:07 I don't know if you're familiar with all that.
00:28:09 Is it sitcom?
00:28:11 No, it was a sketch variety comedy show for kids.
00:28:17 It was on, not SNCC.
00:28:21 Yeah, SNCC was like the Saturday night like Nickelodeon block
00:28:28 for like marginally older kids, maybe.
00:28:30 It's the cooler, hipper one.
00:28:32 A little bit, yeah.
00:28:34 But all that, you know, it had like, it had Keenan and Kel in it,
00:28:38 and Amanda, Amanda Bynes.
00:28:41 Is it, you know, the all that diaspora is extensive.
00:28:45 The big names, you know.
00:28:47 The big names, yeah, yeah, the big names.
00:28:50 Lori, everyone, who could forget Lori Beth Dinberg?
00:28:54 I certainly didn't.
00:28:56 Yeah.
00:28:59 Whatever happened to her?
00:29:01 Anyway, there was an, I think it was a Halloween episode,
00:29:06 and there was a skit in which Amanda Bynes
00:29:11 brings her like monster pet to class for like show and tell,
00:29:15 and it's this big fucking like, it's this big fucking,
00:29:19 I don't know how to describe it, it's a big like furry like beast,
00:29:23 like horned beast that she keeps on like a leash,
00:29:26 and she brings it to class and she's like describing it for show and tell.
00:29:30 And she's, the camera sort of focuses on her as she's like show and tell,
00:29:35 describing things she does with her beast companion.
00:29:38 And meanwhile, the beast is like mauling and killing the other students.
00:29:43 And they, and like, they're like severed limbs are like flying like on screen
00:29:49 from off camera, from where it is dismembering people.
00:29:53 And they don't, there's no blood, they use like green slime for blood.
00:29:57 Like these limbs and stuff are like flying on camera,
00:30:01 and they're like, and they're like green on the stumps where they've been severed,
00:30:05 and they're like oozing like green goo.
00:30:08 Just have a significant impact on you.
00:30:11 And it just goes on, it just goes on and on,
00:30:15 like kind of the point of the scene is how it goes on for a really long time,
00:30:19 and everyone's like, hey, we're being mauled to death,
00:30:21 and the teacher's just like, don't be rude, don't interrupt,
00:30:24 and it just goes on and on until they've all been killed.
00:30:26 That seems like a forgotten like Treehouse of Horror Simpsons.
00:30:29 It's scary, you know?
00:30:32 And it's scared the fuck out of me as a kid.
00:30:35 Yeah, when I describe it.
00:30:37 But that's exactly what happened.
00:30:43 And it upset me a lot, I think.
00:30:46 I think my parents got kind of annoyed at it,
00:30:49 because like it really like disturbed us children at the time.
00:30:54 We were like, we don't want to go to sleep because we're afraid.
00:30:57 We're afraid that the big purple monster is going to kill us.
00:31:00 He was not purple.
00:31:02 He was brown.
00:31:03 I'm just imagining the big fucking thing from Foster's home for imaginary kids.
00:31:09 Yeah.
00:31:10 There's like a big purple guy with horns,
00:31:12 and that's all that's popped into my head.
00:31:14 He looks sort of like a cross between like beauty and the beast beast
00:31:20 and like the father-dook.
00:31:23 That's a good combo.
00:31:25 He was a horned monster of some kind.
00:31:29 He was a villain.
00:31:30 That's all we need to say.
00:31:32 Yeah, yeah.
00:31:33 Okay, that was another time a children's media scared me, a child.
00:31:40 See, I was much easier to scare.
00:31:42 Remember the episode of Spongebob where they're looking after a caterpillar butterfly thing?
00:31:48 And then it shows a close-up of the butterfly's face.
00:31:52 I vaguely remember that episode.
00:31:55 That was enough to scare me as a kid when it cut the realistic live-action high-close-up footage of a bug's face.
00:32:01 Just like an actual video of a bug.
00:32:04 Yeah, it would just like cut and it would be filling like the entire screen,
00:32:08 and it would just be really loud.
00:32:09 They are gross.
00:32:10 Yeah, they are.
00:32:11 Bugs are gross.
00:32:12 They are gross when, like, yeah, butterflies look nice from a distance,
00:32:14 but you look at their face and they're just as disgusting as any other crawling insect.
00:32:18 They got that cute nose, though.
00:32:20 The proboscis.
00:32:21 Yeah, the big curly nose friend.
00:32:23 Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
00:32:26 Still.
00:32:27 That has good energy to it. I like that.
00:32:30 Yeah, sure.
00:32:31 The evil demon eyes.
00:32:32 So I still wouldn't...
00:32:33 Not so keen on them.
00:32:34 Demon eyes.
00:32:35 I still wouldn't...
00:32:36 I wouldn't want one to land on me.
00:32:38 It's still a little gross.
00:32:39 Yeah, I didn't think I would want any bug to land on me, and I don't know why.
00:32:44 No, I wouldn't either.
00:32:46 The wings are nice, but their body is still a nasty bug.
00:32:50 Maybe a dragonfly.
00:32:52 Oh, yeah, I mean...
00:32:54 I think dragonflies are cool-looking, but still.
00:32:59 They got that big, fat tail which makes them look less like a bug,
00:33:02 because most bugs just sort of end or go lumpy at the end, you know?
00:33:07 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:33:09 It makes them a little...
00:33:10 I guess that's why they're called dragonflies.
00:33:12 It makes them a little bit more like other animal king to me.
00:33:15 I don't know.
00:33:17 Yeah.
00:33:19 Still.
00:33:20 Still.
00:33:21 Their head and body is buggy.
00:33:23 A nightmare.
00:33:24 Yeah, that's true.
00:33:25 A nightmare bug creature.
00:33:28 Yeah.
00:33:29 Yeah.
00:33:30 Wormpool.
00:33:31 Would you let a wormpool crawl up on your shoulder?
00:33:35 Here's the thing.
00:33:36 I am a genius, and therefore I'm psychic type, and therefore I'm weak to bugs.
00:33:42 Oh, okay.
00:33:43 So...
00:33:44 No, it would kill me.
00:33:45 It would kill me instantly.
00:33:46 No, I would die.
00:33:47 I would simply die, my friend.
00:33:48 No, I hate...
00:33:49 Actually, no, I hate caterpillars.
00:33:51 I hate caterpillars maybe the most of any bug.
00:33:54 Worms and caterpillars are the worst, and I like them.
00:33:57 So I think if a wormpool was real, it would make me throw up if I saw one in real life.
00:34:03 Yeah.
00:34:04 I'm not big on centipedes, but caterpillars and worms don't really bother me.
00:34:11 I don't like how squishy they are.
00:34:13 I kind of like that.
00:34:14 They're little guys.
00:34:15 They're little fatties, you know?
00:34:18 Yeah.
00:34:19 Yeah.
00:34:20 I have dreams with worms in them sometimes.
00:34:24 It's like a kind of a recurring...
00:34:27 It's kind of a recurring thing.
00:34:29 That sentence wasn't enough to make me laugh, then.
00:34:32 I have dreams with worms in them sometimes.
00:34:34 I do have worm dreams.
00:34:36 Occasionally, I'll have a worm dream.
00:34:38 And it's always...
00:34:39 I'm never as disgusted in the dream as like I should be, and I'll wake up and be like
00:34:43 retroactively disgusted like, oh, God.
00:34:46 No, yeah.
00:34:47 That's the way with dreams.
00:34:49 Your emotions are always like half of what they would be if this thing happened.
00:34:54 Sometimes I'll be really angry in a dream.
00:35:00 I'll be screaming, and then I'll wake up.
00:35:04 And it's just the next moment, but I'll just be like, huh, yeah.
00:35:09 I was really mad.
00:35:11 I find that dreamy has a lot of passivity to him.
00:35:15 I remember there was one dream where I can't remember how it happened.
00:35:18 For some reason, my entire genital area was gouged out and was just a big bleeding,
00:35:22 fucking gaping cannonball wound, basically.
00:35:25 And I was lying in hospital and talking to someone.
00:35:29 I was like, it is what it is.
00:35:31 Things happen.
00:35:33 What's the Japanese?
00:35:35 What's the Japanese?
00:35:36 It is what it is.
00:35:37 I have no idea.
00:35:38 What the fuck do you think I am?
00:35:40 It's a common phrase you hear in anime and stuff.
00:35:47 Konnichiwa.
00:35:50 Shogunai.
00:35:52 Shogunai.
00:35:53 It can't be helped.
00:35:55 That's so good.
00:35:58 Shogunai.
00:35:59 That's what I said.
00:36:01 You look down.
00:36:02 You've been bifurcated, bisected at the midst of Shogunai.
00:36:07 It is what it is.
00:36:09 These things happen, I guess.
00:36:12 It's always shit like that.
00:36:14 I had a dream in high school where I was in a zombie apocalypse
00:36:18 and I was with the girl I had a crush on.
00:36:20 And I was like, don't worry.
00:36:23 We'll make it through this.
00:36:24 We'll rebuild the world.
00:36:26 Stuff like that.
00:36:28 For some reason, dream me seems to be a wise, sage-ly, completely calm.
00:36:33 Just not sweating it that much.
00:36:35 Just not worried about it.
00:36:36 Yeah, basically.
00:36:38 In a situation like that, you got to step up.
00:36:41 You got to calmly analyze the situation.
00:36:46 And just like, all right, here's what we're going to do.
00:36:50 You're going to put the plow on the front of our Mack truck
00:36:54 and we're going to drive through this parking lot.
00:36:56 Well, you kill literally everyone you meet.
00:36:59 Be they human or Zomboni or whatever.
00:37:03 Sure.
00:37:05 Yeah.
00:37:06 Is that what happens in The Last of Us?
00:37:08 I don't remember.
00:37:10 I haven't played The Last of Us.
00:37:12 I played it for the first time recently.
00:37:14 There are bandits.
00:37:16 There are bandits that you do have to kill in The Last of Us.
00:37:18 Yes, that's true.
00:37:20 I believe the backstory of the main character is that
00:37:23 during the 20 years of the zombie apocalypse, he would do anything.
00:37:26 So he would just kill like everybody he came across.
00:37:29 Engaged in some light banditry.
00:37:31 And then he meets the girl and says,
00:37:34 oh, what if I can be daddy again?
00:37:36 And then he becomes daddy again.
00:37:40 What a beautiful story.
00:37:42 Beautiful.
00:37:44 Actually, I only know the story of it because I've seen
00:37:48 the action button review.
00:37:50 Yeah.
00:37:51 Oh, I haven't seen that one.
00:37:53 Now that I've played it, I could watch that one.
00:37:55 Oh, you have.
00:37:56 I've seen all the action button reviews.
00:38:00 What was it?
00:38:01 That's a pretty good one.
00:38:03 I was drawing and I had like Matthew Matosis and Noah Coldwell
00:38:06 in the background.
00:38:07 And I got all of their Last of Us videos in a row.
00:38:10 And I was like...
00:38:12 Were they just auto like recommended?
00:38:14 Yeah.
00:38:15 So I think I was watching like a Metroid one and then it went
00:38:17 to Matthew Matosis's Last of Us one, which came out in like 2014.
00:38:20 So it was like really weird and tearing him back then.
00:38:23 His old videos have held up really well, though.
00:38:26 Who? Matthew Matosis?
00:38:27 Yeah.
00:38:28 They're exactly the same except the mic quality is a bit different
00:38:31 and he's a bit higher pitch.
00:38:33 Yeah, but he said the N word that one time.
00:38:35 Oh yeah, he did.
00:38:36 Yeah, true.
00:38:37 We can't.
00:38:38 We can't.
00:38:39 You can't condone him.
00:38:40 He said it in an Irish accent though, so it doesn't count.
00:38:43 Yeah, it's true.
00:38:45 That's true.
00:38:46 I mean, Irish people were also called that.
00:38:48 Yeah, I completely forgot about that.
00:38:50 I've never rewatched that review because I don't care about Bioshock.
00:38:54 I like that review because I hate Bioshock Infinite.
00:38:58 And he also hates it.
00:39:01 I mean, a lot of people hate it.
00:39:03 I played it and thought it was bad, but I don't particularly hate it.
00:39:06 But I have never played a single other Bioshock game.
00:39:09 I watched Nate play it and I thought, okay.
00:39:13 And then upon thinking about it more later and hearing more people talk about it,
00:39:18 I kind of realized that it's pretty despicable actually.
00:39:21 Yeah.
00:39:24 It do suck.
00:39:25 I would say it do suck as a game.
00:39:27 Yeah, I would say so.
00:39:29 As a game.
00:39:31 As a gamer.
00:39:33 It sucks as a game and it sucks as a piece of gaming culture.
00:39:38 It's like a regressive sort of damaging piece of media.
00:39:42 That game has such a huge fan, but that game specifically, Bioshock Infinite,
00:39:47 people fucking love that game.
00:39:49 I know so many people that stand by it.
00:39:51 I get what's appealing about it.
00:39:56 The setting is kind of cool.
00:39:58 It looks nice.
00:39:59 Yeah.
00:40:00 That's about it.
00:40:02 Yeah, everything else about it is bad.
00:40:05 It's kind of bad.
00:40:06 Like the gameplay even.
00:40:08 As a guy.
00:40:09 I didn't actually play it myself.
00:40:11 As somebody who likes a good shoot bang and playing that game.
00:40:14 That game came out 10 years after Halo 1 and it plays excrementally worse.
00:40:19 Excrementally is a good word.
00:40:22 Combined.
00:40:23 You've combined some concepts there.
00:40:26 I definitely did not fuck up and say the wrong thing.
00:40:29 Move on.
00:40:30 Bioshock Infinite suck.
00:40:32 Last of us pretty good.
00:40:34 Yeah.
00:40:39 Sure.
00:40:42 I mean, Tim likes last of us more than I would.
00:40:50 Yeah.
00:40:51 Tim finds some interesting things to appreciate.
00:40:56 I think Tim has a little bit of a sort of Gen X boomer sensibility.
00:41:02 And the things that he appreciates that I think I am a little.
00:41:06 He's a little bit, this is awesome.
00:41:08 He's, yeah, he's a little bit like, he's a little bit like, oh, 60 frames per second.
00:41:13 Like HD.
00:41:14 Like at high res, high res, high frame rate.
00:41:17 Like, oh, beautiful.
00:41:18 Yeah.
00:41:20 He's, he's impressed by that sort of thing.
00:41:22 I see.
00:41:23 Yeah, definitely.
00:41:24 It's like, I don't know, every single one of those fucking long form reviewers have
00:41:28 their thing.
00:41:29 I think.
00:41:30 Like Mathematosis seems to be mechanical complexity and solid, like actual design in
00:41:36 terms of going through the world and stuff.
00:41:39 No, we're called Weldovace is all about the experiential storytelling and things like
00:41:44 that.
00:41:45 And Tim Rogers is sort of this.
00:41:48 I don't know how I would describe like his like focus on when he talks about games.
00:41:52 He's very like tangential.
00:41:54 I guess that's the whole point, but you know, I don't know how I would boil it down.
00:41:59 Yeah, there's no way to boil it down.
00:42:03 You're like, maybe he's maybe focused on a game's like.
00:42:10 Reputation.
00:42:11 Yeah, it's like it's cultural.
00:42:13 It's cultural impact.
00:42:14 It's impact on the landscape.
00:42:16 It's it's he reviews games from the perspective of a gamer.
00:42:23 Looking at the landscape of games.
00:42:25 No, I don't know.
00:42:26 That's angry Joe.
00:42:27 Angry Joe does that.
00:42:30 Oh, angry Joe.
00:42:31 Oh, bless you, my friend.
00:42:33 I have not.
00:42:34 I'm not as familiar with his uvra.
00:42:38 He's very much.
00:42:40 That was fucking awesome.
00:42:41 Or this is fucking dog shit.
00:42:43 Where's the shooting?
00:42:46 I think I've seen.
00:42:48 Oh, you know what?
00:42:50 Which there's a there's a jar podcast where they compare.
00:42:55 I think they compare Doug Walker to angry Joe.
00:42:59 No, they did two separate episodes.
00:43:01 One was is the Nostalgia Criticist fringe, as they say, and is angry Joe as bad as they say?
00:43:06 Oh, yeah.
00:43:07 Right.
00:43:08 Yeah, it was two separate ones, but like they they they have a lot of like comparatively
00:43:12 positive things to say.
00:43:14 Oh, yeah.
00:43:15 They're very passionate people.
00:43:17 Yeah.
00:43:18 Yeah.
00:43:20 What was that thing?
00:43:21 What was that thing he did?
00:43:23 Like he like.
00:43:25 He said something like completely out of line to some like games journalist or like death or
00:43:31 reporter at the game.
00:43:33 But it made me stand up and clap.
00:43:35 He interviewed Jeff Keeley.
00:43:37 And I don't know what specific thing you're talking about, but he just made like a full
00:43:42 of himself basically by being completely unprepared.
00:43:45 No.
00:43:46 No, it wasn't that he.
00:43:48 I don't remember he.
00:43:49 I think he said you're appealing to the lowest common denominator.
00:43:52 Is that it?
00:43:53 Is that the one you're thinking of?
00:43:55 Your show appeals to the lowest common denominator after you've been invited.
00:43:59 He basically just told this guy like he sucks and like in so many words.
00:44:04 And I was like, cool.
00:44:06 I don't know.
00:44:09 I don't even know.
00:44:10 I don't even know who this guy is.
00:44:11 I didn't care.
00:44:12 But like if you think this guy sucks, it's nice that you'll just, you know, you're
00:44:16 not here to like play nice with someone that you hate.
00:44:19 Yeah.
00:44:20 If you hate someone, I respect the willingness to just tell them you fucking suck, dude.
00:44:24 Exactly.
00:44:25 You're an asshole.
00:44:26 God bless you.
00:44:27 Don't be a joke.
00:44:28 Keep it up.
00:44:29 Yeah.
00:44:30 I don't know what he's doing now, but whatever.
00:44:32 Probably reviewing video games.
00:44:34 Probably talking about is there any new video games have come out stray?
00:44:38 The cat game?
00:44:39 I saw stray.
00:44:40 I saw the, what do you call it?
00:44:45 Spyro mod.
00:44:46 Spyro mod.
00:44:47 It could be Spyro the Dragon.
00:44:48 Oh yeah.
00:44:49 Yeah.
00:44:50 Okay.
00:44:51 I was going to say what?
00:44:52 I saw that video.
00:44:53 I thought it looked pretty fun.
00:44:57 What is stray?
00:44:58 I'm pretty sure it's just like a short exploratory story game.
00:45:03 People were hyping it on Twitter.
00:45:05 It's a cute cat game.
00:45:07 So of course, you know.
00:45:08 But it's like a cat going through a post-pocalyptic world with robots and going through a story
00:45:15 and then you finish it.
00:45:16 I don't know.
00:45:17 Well, what more can you ask for?
00:45:20 From what I know, it's pretty short.
00:45:22 But I didn't play it because it would have made me sad because my cat died recently.
00:45:27 Yeah.
00:45:28 Crunchy.
00:45:29 I saw that.
00:45:30 It came out the day after Crunchy time.
00:45:32 Oh yeah.
00:45:33 Crunchy.
00:45:34 I saw, I'd seen pictures before.
00:45:37 Yeah.
00:45:38 I looked at the, just, Crunchy looked like a sweet cat.
00:45:42 He was a good, good, good boy.
00:45:44 Yeah.
00:45:45 But the heat wave genuinely killed him.
00:45:48 No.
00:45:49 It was horrible to say.
00:45:50 But he's always had like trouble with his breathing.
00:45:53 And he's had a thing with his nose where it leaks and stuff.
00:45:56 But the recent heat wave in the UK, he was just like lying on the ground gasping because
00:46:01 he couldn't get any breath in because it was so hot.
00:46:03 Oh no.
00:46:04 We took him to the vet and it was like, yeah, you can have a big expensive surgery, but
00:46:11 he is 17 and probably is suffering right now.
00:46:16 And we were like, yeah, it's time to say goodbye.
00:46:20 But it's all good.
00:46:22 Anyway, on a more positive note, Stray looks like a fun video game where you play as a
00:46:29 pretty cat.
00:46:31 It looked, I guess, I just, you know, just looked fun to like jump between ledges and
00:46:36 stuff and knock, knock shit over.
00:46:38 That's true.
00:46:39 Fuck around with humans who I guess are not in the game.
00:46:42 It seems like every human is like a robot.
00:46:44 Yeah.
00:46:45 I thought at first maybe that's like a stylistic thing.
00:46:47 Like the cat just sees humans as automatons.
00:46:50 But then I thought, no, maybe this is actually just said in like a post-singularity future
00:46:54 where robots are the dominant species.
00:46:57 Yes, maybe.
00:46:58 Yeah.
00:46:59 I'm not sure.
00:47:00 I have no idea.
00:47:03 Speaking of short games, this guy on Twitter, Fulgadrum, he added me in a thread.
00:47:13 He shouted out my game, Phantom's Revenge.
00:47:16 I saw that.
00:47:18 Well, yeah.
00:47:19 Did you look at the thread?
00:47:21 No.
00:47:22 I didn't like it.
00:47:23 I saw the post of yours and it said equally unhinged webcomic.
00:47:26 I was like completely fair, absolutely fair.
00:47:30 When I do the Kickstarter, I should market it as unhinged.
00:47:34 I think that's a good angle.
00:47:36 You could put that as a quote, like a pull quote.
00:47:40 Equally unhinged web.
00:47:41 You know what?
00:47:42 Maybe I will.
00:47:43 The finale to the equally unhinged webcomic.
00:47:45 Just have that in text and then put like five asterisks below it instead of five stars
00:47:50 because you can get away with that.
00:47:52 It will trick people.
00:47:54 Now I'm, yeah, this guy didn't give any stars, but who's to say that the five stars that
00:48:01 I placed in quotations underneath his quote, I didn't say they were his stars.
00:48:07 I just put them there.
00:48:09 Those aren't stars.
00:48:10 Those are asterisks and they're there for an unrelated reason.
00:48:13 They're just decoration, bro.
00:48:15 That's part of the art.
00:48:19 Oh man, on that subject.
00:48:22 Well, I don't want to...
00:48:24 What was the thread?
00:48:26 Okay, yeah, on the subject of the thread.
00:48:28 The thread, it's the thread about short RPGs and some of them look super awesome.
00:48:36 They look better than your game.
00:48:39 I mean, I wasn't going to say it like that.
00:48:43 I mean, some of them do have like a very cool aesthetic to them.
00:48:48 I'm just scrolling through these and like, there were some that stood out to me like,
00:48:54 look at, okay, look at this shit.
00:48:58 This game, I guess, is called Strife of Cosmos.
00:49:05 I don't know what's going on here.
00:49:07 That's pretty cool.
00:49:09 I just think it looks awesome.
00:49:13 It's a little brain rot.
00:49:15 So many things on screen for me, but yeah.
00:49:18 Exactly.
00:49:20 I prefer to cut down on the aesthetic a little bit, but that does look like an RPG to me.
00:49:27 This one looks really cool.
00:49:29 I don't know, it's going through these threads.
00:49:31 Some of these are like two hours long.
00:49:33 I might actually go and play some of these.
00:49:37 That'd be fun.
00:49:38 Maybe on like a stream or something going through the rest of them.
00:49:41 That'd be cool.
00:49:42 Yeah, maybe.
00:49:43 Wait a minute.
00:49:44 Oh my God.
00:49:45 This one's called Slimes.
00:49:46 This one's called Phantom's Revenge, but it's also ugly.
00:49:49 Oh my God.
00:49:50 That sounds like an epic video game.
00:49:54 This one's called Slimes.
00:49:57 Well, I got to play that one.
00:49:59 Yeah.
00:50:01 Yeah.
00:50:02 On the subject of the book, since the Unhinged Webcomic, I have been, I worked like all week.
00:50:08 I basically spent like this entire week just doing shit, man.
00:50:14 Just like doing work on like the format.
00:50:20 Just like formatting files to fit the goddamn template this Chinese company wants me to fit
00:50:28 to have the stupid book printed.
00:50:30 I'm almost ready.
00:50:31 I'm almost ready to print a test print.
00:50:36 Man, I don't know.
00:50:38 It's really bummed me out.
00:50:39 I just felt like I worked like every day this week, and it feels like I'm barely closer
00:50:45 to having it done.
00:50:46 That's not true.
00:50:47 I am close to having it done.
00:50:49 The progress is slow and incremental, but you've done so much of it that you are actually
00:50:53 doing all right.
00:50:55 I'm almost there.
00:50:57 When I get it sent off and when I send her some money and she's like, okay, thanks.
00:51:01 You'll have the book in like three weeks.
00:51:03 I'll be like, thank God, but I'm not quite there yet.
00:51:07 It feels like I've worked and worked and accomplished nothing.
00:51:10 Yeah.
00:51:11 I seriously did nothing else this week.
00:51:17 I didn't get to play any more Mega Man legends.
00:51:19 I didn't get to work on that video project basically at all.
00:51:24 I have put that...
00:51:25 No, finish the next step of the book.
00:51:28 Finish the next fucking book thing.
00:51:29 Do I know what the video project is?
00:51:31 I don't think I do.
00:51:32 I don't think I have told you about it.
00:51:36 Do you want to know?
00:51:37 No, I don't.
00:51:38 Okay, good.
00:51:39 That's fine.
00:51:40 I want to surprise.
00:51:41 I need some surprises in my life.
00:51:43 I have told...
00:51:44 I think Gib might be the only person who I've straight up just told what it is.
00:51:51 I think maybe one or two other people have guessed it or no.
00:51:56 Okay.
00:51:57 Yeah.
00:51:58 I probably, if I thought about it, I might be able to guess it, but whatever.
00:52:02 Perhaps, maybe.
00:52:03 Yeah, if you're not an idiot, yeah.
00:52:06 Ellie is our bleep that out.
00:52:10 Oh, shit.
00:52:11 That's not exactly it, but it's kind of...
00:52:14 It's sort of on the...
00:52:15 It's too close.
00:52:16 Ellie is our bleep that out.
00:52:21 I can't believe you're reviewing this.
00:52:26 Bleep everything.
00:52:27 Oh, no!
00:52:28 No way.
00:52:29 No, that's not...
00:52:30 No, that's not...
00:52:31 No, that's not...
00:52:32 Okay, I was going to say.
00:52:34 Okay, Ellie is our get ready to bleep a lot of stuff.
00:52:37 No, I'm doing a lecture where I do...
00:52:41 I'm doing a lecture on...
00:52:44 Nice.
00:52:45 Right.
00:52:46 But no one can know.
00:52:47 It's a secret.
00:52:48 Okay.
00:52:49 Is it just like a straight video to audience lecture?
00:52:53 Are you going to...
00:52:54 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:52:55 Yeah.
00:52:56 Okay.
00:52:57 Cool.
00:52:58 There was a...
00:52:59 I was going to do it live.
00:53:04 I had a...
00:53:05 I had a studio books and everything.
00:53:09 Like, when Gib visited for...
00:53:11 Whoa!
00:53:12 Yeah, I had a whole thing set up and then Gib got COVID, so it all couldn't happen.
00:53:19 So, Ellie is our bleep most everything.
00:53:24 Cut that, cut that, cut that, cut that, cut that.
00:53:26 Don't let them know.
00:53:28 Don't let them know.
00:53:30 Wow, Ben, that project sounded interesting.
00:53:33 Thank you.
00:53:34 I can't believe I guessed it that easily.
00:53:37 You got it...
00:53:39 That's 75% right.
00:53:41 Okay.
00:53:42 Yeah.
00:53:43 You were close enough that I would call it correct.
00:53:46 Sure.
00:53:47 Anyway.
00:53:48 That's fun.
00:53:49 So, I think it's fun.
00:53:51 Although, I've been working on it.
00:53:53 I thought it was going to be kind of easy.
00:53:55 I have decided to make it hard on myself, but it's okay.
00:53:58 That's the way to do something like that.
00:54:01 Yeah.
00:54:02 My new goal with it...
00:54:04 My goal has expanded so that...
00:54:06 I think the video will just end up being longer and that's okay.
00:54:10 Long videos are good.
00:54:11 People like them and they do well on YouTube.
00:54:13 So, I don't even think that's a problem.
00:54:15 Exactly, yeah.
00:54:16 Yeah.
00:54:17 So, that's...
00:54:19 But I didn't get to do it because I have just been doing book stuff.
00:54:24 I hate it.
00:54:25 I hate the stupid fucking book.
00:54:28 It sucks.
00:54:30 It's not even that unhinged, to be honest.
00:54:32 Yeah, it's not unhinged enough.
00:54:34 No, not even close.
00:54:35 It's more unhinged by the context than actual what happens in it.
00:54:41 You know, speaking of context, I mean, I guess Chris Chan's going to trial now.
00:54:47 Yes.
00:54:48 I thought like, hmm, I wonder if I can like...
00:54:52 I wonder if I can use that for marketing purposes.
00:54:55 Ben...
00:54:57 What?
00:54:59 We've been down this rabbit hole before.
00:55:02 I'm in it.
00:55:03 I'm down it.
00:55:05 I'm at the bottom of it.
00:55:07 Ben, do I have to be one of the people in the comments who said,
00:55:09 oh, what ever happened to Prime Directive Chris Chan, Ben?
00:55:15 Well, she can't hurt anyone anymore.
00:55:17 That's true.
00:55:18 I suppose.
00:55:19 She's going away for a long time.
00:55:21 I don't know.
00:55:22 I saw Chris Chan trending because the announcement came out that the case is going to trial.
00:55:28 Did you rub your hands together and then look at all your formatted phantoms revenge comics on your computer?
00:55:35 I don't know.
00:55:37 If the trial was happening and there was like news coming out about it, I don't know.
00:55:43 Maybe it would...
00:55:44 Maybe I could use that.
00:55:47 How long has it been since Chris Chan was arrested?
00:55:50 Is it a year and a half now?
00:55:52 I don't think it's that long.
00:55:56 Wait.
00:55:58 I think it might be.
00:56:00 Wait, when did I put out Sonichi 102?
00:56:04 That would be good.
00:56:06 Because that was like right after...
00:56:08 11 months ago.
00:56:10 Yeah, so almost a year.
00:56:12 Okay.
00:56:13 Yeah.
00:56:14 I'm overestimating time.
00:56:17 Did I have an exact date?
00:56:19 July?
00:56:20 On a wild ride, it's been...
00:56:22 Yeah, I put out that video on July 31st.
00:56:25 Wait, that was exactly a year ago today.
00:56:29 What?
00:56:30 Wow.
00:56:31 Well, that video came out exactly a year ago today.
00:56:34 That's amazing.
00:56:36 That's funny.
00:56:38 That was days afterwards.
00:56:40 It was a few days afterwards, yeah.
00:56:42 That's less than a week.
00:56:44 We're recording on things like...
00:56:46 That's funny.
00:56:48 Only a paltry 200,000 views.
00:56:52 Such a shame.
00:56:53 Such a shame.
00:56:54 Deserves 10 times that many.
00:56:56 What's my biggest tweet got in terms of impressions?
00:57:00 Can I ratio with that?
00:57:03 I bet not.
00:57:05 Tweets don't get 200,000 likes.
00:57:09 Maybe impressions.
00:57:12 I got 418,000 impressions on one of them.
00:57:17 Wow.
00:57:18 Which one was that?
00:57:20 It was a drawing of a character from My Hero Academia
00:57:23 that was an unfinished sketch dog shit.
00:57:26 For some reason, it got 23,000 likes on Twitter.
00:57:32 I don't know.
00:57:34 Why did this one blow up?
00:57:36 A like on Twitter is better than a view on YouTube.
00:57:41 But an impression...
00:57:42 Yeah, because you have to click the button.
00:57:44 But an impression on Twitter is not as good as a view on YouTube
00:57:47 because you don't have to click anything
00:57:49 to make an impression.
00:57:51 I don't know.
00:57:53 My Twitter has gone nuts recently.
00:57:56 I saw you gained 10k followers this year.
00:57:59 I've gained 14.6k followers in this month.
00:58:06 And I don't know what happened.
00:58:09 I just put out two banger tweets at least.
00:58:12 Two drawings that just did really well.
00:58:14 Which ones were those?
00:58:16 It was the Nika Robin and that one I just sent you.
00:58:20 Oh.
00:58:22 Is it the My Hero Academia?
00:58:24 Yeah.
00:58:26 And then this one.
00:58:28 The most boring drawings ever.
00:58:30 What I would consider a pretty typical Simsie outfit.
00:58:34 Yeah.
00:58:35 There's nothing special about this.
00:58:37 I don't know why they went beast mode.
00:58:40 Yeah.
00:58:42 I don't know.
00:58:46 Maybe it's just because your account is bigger.
00:58:50 And so when you have a hit tweet, the hits get bigger.
00:58:54 Gross is exponential.
00:58:56 How can I monetize that?
00:58:59 Why can't I make it so that people have to pay me a dollar
00:59:03 to follow me?
00:59:05 Can you do that?
00:59:07 No.
00:59:09 You can do that stupid super follow thing.
00:59:12 I don't know what the fuck that is.
00:59:15 Okay, speaking of stupid Twitter features that I don't like,
00:59:20 do you ever see Twitter, I think they're called Twitter Spaces?
00:59:25 Yes.
00:59:27 It's like an audio call that you can join and listen to someone talk live if you want.
00:59:34 I saw someone was doing one.
00:59:38 This guy, Alex, I think it's pronounced Deegan.
00:59:41 Do you know who that is?
00:59:43 No, no idea.
00:59:45 He made a book called...
00:59:47 Oh fuck, what's the title?
00:59:49 He's done a couple comic, comic, graphic novels.
00:59:53 Soft x-ray mind hunters.
00:59:57 Soft x-ray mind.
01:00:00 Let me just post an image so you can get an impression of what sort of art this guy does.
01:00:08 Am I going to be overjoyed or disgusted?
01:00:11 No, it's joyful, it's joyful.
01:00:15 Okay, this is not the best image, but here's a sample.
01:00:21 The word soft has me concerned.
01:00:26 No, no, no, no, no.
01:00:28 Okay.
01:00:30 There are some boobs, I guess, but whatever.
01:00:34 This is neat surrealism stuff.
01:00:38 He did this book called soft x-ray mind hunters.
01:00:41 My friend John lent me that book.
01:00:43 I read it and I thought it was cool and I followed this guy on Twitter.
01:00:46 He's not super big on Twitter or anything.
01:00:48 But he was doing a space the other day and I was like, oh, it's that guy.
01:00:53 I guess I'll join the space and see what's up.
01:00:56 There was like one other person in the space and I joined it.
01:01:01 And he was just playing some hip hop music.
01:01:05 And the text chat in the space just kept sending messages of the lyrics of the song.
01:01:16 And I think it was automated somehow.
01:01:20 And I was like, what's the fucking point of this?
01:01:23 He was just doing a karaoke stream.
01:01:25 He was not singing.
01:01:27 He was speech to text typing, auto typing, karaoke.
01:01:37 I don't know, that might just be a thing that spaces do on their own.
01:01:42 I bet you.
01:01:43 You started it and was like, you know, when you start a live stream and nobody's there and you're like, hello?
01:01:49 Is anyone there?
01:01:50 Is anyone in the chat yet?
01:01:53 I don't know.
01:01:55 That kind of thing where you're just sort of like waiting for someone to show up and then you got bored and started listening to music.
01:02:00 And then he was like, how can I turn this into a thing and then started spamming the audio?
01:02:06 I don't know.
01:02:08 Well, I mean, I joined it for like five minutes just to see what was going on.
01:02:13 Nothing was going on.
01:02:14 You were like, haha, that's crazy.
01:02:16 Bye.
01:02:17 I'll talk about this on my podcast.
01:02:21 I can mine this for content.
01:02:25 I have seen that was the only space I've ever joined.
01:02:29 I guess I would call it a bit of a disappointment, to be honest.
01:02:33 But maybe some other spaces are good sometimes.
01:02:37 I think I joined one from some artists.
01:02:41 I don't remember who it was, but I blocked them shortly afterwards because of something not okay.
01:02:47 They said on the space and I was like, I don't think I want to be aligned with that.
01:02:52 So you were in the space and he said something and you were like, oh no.
01:02:55 I joined the space and I was like just listening.
01:02:58 And then he said the F word that is offensive to the gay people and said that to the chat saying,
01:03:06 you guys are the F word that is offensive to the gay people to the chat.
01:03:11 I was like, yeah, I don't think I want to.
01:03:15 Have you seen, this is not entirely related, but have you seen the one thing that Neil Cisariga ever said to Jon Tron?
01:03:25 No.
01:03:27 Is it great?
01:03:29 Yeah, it is great.
01:03:32 I'll try to find the image, but basically Jon Tron, I think Neil made a tweet in a thread that Jon was tagged in or something.
01:03:42 And Jon replies like, hey man, like big fan, keep up the great work.
01:03:47 And Neil says like, thanks, all I know about you is you were a huge dick to someone that asked you not to say the R word.
01:03:56 And that's it.
01:04:03 I know Jon Tron was in an internet historian video recently.
01:04:06 Yeah, I deliberately did not go watch the video.
01:04:09 I like the internet historians like videos, but I don't want to see it.
01:04:13 I did watch that one and all I got from it was that his middle, Jon Tron's middle name is apparently Arian and I didn't know that before and that was funny.
01:04:22 And he called him out on that.
01:04:23 Is that his actual?
01:04:24 Apparently.
01:04:25 I think so.
01:04:27 Unless he just did the funny internet historian thing where he edits a Wikipedia article and shows it on screen.
01:04:34 It was not a good video.
01:04:35 Jon Tron is not funny.
01:04:37 He, yeah, I mean, some of his older videos seemed funny, but then like, I think the last one I watched was the one where he like fucks around in like fucking like Plymouth, Massachusetts, like doing like some sort of stupid historical cosplay.
01:04:53 Yeah.
01:04:54 Now it was not funny.
01:04:55 Yeah.
01:04:56 I know his latest video was like a parody of like Ted Talks and it was it was five minutes long of him like doing, you know, when like like a sketch comedy where it's like hard cutting between the like a guy pretending to be emotional speakers just saying weird things.
01:05:09 But you got to be motivated.
01:05:11 Time to move like shit like that, you know?
01:05:13 I don't really know.
01:05:17 Just like acting and pretending to be a funny motivational speaker who's embarrassing.
01:05:23 It's like that.
01:05:24 And it's like a six minute long video.
01:05:25 And at the very end, it's just like an advert for Rachel the legend to some shit or some or no, a dislike or whatever that is.
01:05:33 It's a motherfucking game.
01:05:34 I don't know what that is, but okay.
01:05:36 It was like, it was like an ad disguised as a comedy video.
01:05:40 And it wasn't even like where he put an ad in one of his normal videos.
01:05:43 It's just that I can see.
01:05:46 I mean, I can see how the premise could be funny.
01:05:50 Just opposing some kind of embarrassing motivational speaker with someone else's sort of like grim reality or whatever.
01:06:00 I'd like to confirm.
01:06:02 Not funny.
01:06:04 All right.
01:06:06 Yeah, I like the Internet historian.
01:06:10 I mean, going thinking back, I definitely get the sense that his politics, his personal politics are maybe not great.
01:06:18 But it doesn't really come into his videos much.
01:06:21 So I kind of just like if he's not going to make a big deal about it, then I guess I'm not going to complain about it.
01:06:28 Yeah.
01:06:29 So, you know, I like Internet story.
01:06:33 Yeah.
01:06:34 It's one of those channels that I will let play in the background, rewatch videos a lot.
01:06:39 Yeah, they go pretty.
01:06:42 I've rewatched them a few.
01:06:45 I've seen a couple of them a few times.
01:06:47 Yeah.
01:06:48 They're good.
01:06:50 Not interested in his secondary channel though.
01:06:54 I do like his secondary channel, actually.
01:06:57 Oh, really?
01:06:58 Yeah.
01:06:59 It's just them rambling about life stories and stuff.
01:07:02 But I find that fairly entertaining.
01:07:05 I haven't checked it out.
01:07:07 The John Tron episode sucks though.
01:07:11 Yeah.
01:07:14 At some point, I think it was that old timey colonial video.
01:07:23 I think I just decided, you know what, I just don't think John Tron is funny.
01:07:26 Yeah.
01:07:27 I don't think I will ever watch another John Tron video.
01:07:31 Not because I don't like him, although that's true.
01:07:34 I'm simply not entertained.
01:07:36 I think I have watched a bunch of them recently.
01:07:39 I only watched that stupid advertising one because it was recommended to me.
01:07:45 I was like, what the fuck is this?
01:07:48 I wonder what that guy's up to.
01:07:51 I think the one you were talking about came out in like three years ago from looking at
01:07:55 this channel.
01:07:57 Yeah.
01:08:00 I think that was the first one that had come out in a while.
01:08:03 I was curious about it or something.
01:08:09 If you never have a public apology for things that you did, then it means that you don't
01:08:15 regret them.
01:08:17 No, he doesn't.
01:08:18 He's totally unrepentant.
01:08:19 I hate him.
01:08:20 He's so obnoxious.
01:08:22 It's obnoxious when people defend him.
01:08:26 The people that defend him are really obnoxious because he's clearly not apologetic about
01:08:33 anything.
01:08:34 So like, don't fucking tell me.
01:08:36 Yeah.
01:08:37 Don't tell me.
01:08:38 Don't lie to me, cowards.
01:08:40 Dude, back off.
01:08:41 Dude, come on.
01:08:42 Yeah.
01:08:43 Yeah.
01:08:44 Yeah.
01:08:45 Fight me.
01:08:46 Anyway, good YouTube interrogation videos of any kind based.
01:08:51 Interrogate.
01:08:52 You mean like...
01:08:53 Jim can't swim.
01:08:54 Yeah.
01:08:55 With us.
01:08:56 Things like that.
01:08:57 Didn't Jim can't swim?
01:08:58 Get like kicked off YouTube for a while?
01:09:00 They got nuked.
01:09:01 They got nuked.
01:09:02 Loads of their videos got deleted like one around Christmas, I think it was.
01:09:06 I think most of them are still up, but like their latest one that they did is still gone.
01:09:12 Bummer.
01:09:13 I don't know why.
01:09:15 Yeah.
01:09:16 I don't know why.
01:09:17 It sucks.
01:09:18 Yeah, why?
01:09:19 I don't know.
01:09:20 All they do is show things and talk about them.
01:09:24 I don't know.
01:09:25 There's nothing particularly offensive in there, especially when it's all taken from
01:09:29 that weird clinical perspective, which is what makes the videos good.
01:09:32 I mean, is it like the only thing I can think that like might be objectionable about it is
01:09:39 like that maybe it could be considered like murder bilia, like profiting off a crime almost.
01:09:44 Maybe.
01:09:45 Which is like, I don't know if I would make that argument.
01:09:48 I don't know because there's plenty of other channels that do the same thing, do a similar
01:09:53 or the same thing.
01:09:54 Yeah.
01:09:55 Yeah.
01:09:56 True.
01:09:57 Things that seem to have not had these issues.
01:10:00 I don't know why Jim can't swim was a single out.
01:10:04 I saw they were posting.
01:10:06 This was a while ago.
01:10:07 They were saying like they were considering like moving to a different platform or something.
01:10:10 Yeah.
01:10:11 And like, I mean, other platforms are terrible.
01:10:16 But like, yeah, I do really like those videos.
01:10:19 I might go watch something.
01:10:23 I might go watch a Jim can't swim video on to be or whatever.
01:10:26 Yeah.
01:10:28 There's another channel called explore with us, which pretty much does the same thing.
01:10:31 And but they're just a bit more long form and more detailed.
01:10:34 And that one's very good.
01:10:36 I don't.
01:10:37 I've not heard.
01:10:38 I've not heard of that one.
01:10:41 I think they they they think they've blown up more recently, but they're they're originally
01:10:49 their videos were a lot more like their videos are really click bait for what they are.
01:10:54 Like, you know how Jim can't swim is a little bit.
01:10:57 But like, you know, a good in like a cool way.
01:11:00 Yeah.
01:11:01 A little bit, a little bit click baby.
01:11:03 Like what what pretending to be crazy looks like.
01:11:05 That's like honest.
01:11:06 That is what the video is about.
01:11:07 But some of some of the explore with us thumbnails are a bit like, come on, man.
01:11:13 Look at this.
01:11:16 Let me see.
01:11:18 Explore with us.
01:11:20 I just sent a screenshot of the like recent ones.
01:11:24 Oh, yeah.
01:11:26 Yeah, these look pretty similar.
01:11:29 They are basically the same thing.
01:11:32 Going to release my Bible.
01:11:34 Okay.
01:11:35 You pick out a really like.
01:11:36 Weird.
01:11:37 Coletious quote.
01:11:38 That one is a very good video.
01:11:40 I really enjoyed that.
01:11:42 Hmm.
01:11:43 Okay.
01:11:44 It's a.
01:11:45 It's a what is it?
01:11:46 It's a 15 year old girl.
01:11:48 Her 19 year old boyfriend.
01:11:50 And they're like 22 year old bipolar autistic friend.
01:11:54 Who murdered someone.
01:11:56 And it go and it like cuts between all the different interrogations in a way.
01:12:00 Where like reveals the information to you at the same time and stuff, even though the.
01:12:03 It's good.
01:12:04 It's well made.
01:12:05 You know what?
01:12:06 That sounds interesting.
01:12:07 The the narrator is not quite as silky smooth as.
01:12:11 Jim.
01:12:12 Jim can't swim one.
01:12:14 Yeah.
01:12:15 I assume his name is Jim.
01:12:16 I don't know.
01:12:17 No, he isn't.
01:12:18 He's a guy that they hired to do the narration.
01:12:20 I think.
01:12:21 If you look in the description of some of the Jim can't swim videos, it has a link to his
01:12:24 channel.
01:12:25 And it's mostly him going like, you know, the Republicans, they really fucked up this
01:12:29 time.
01:12:30 And I'm not.
01:12:31 I.
01:12:32 Oh, okay.
01:12:33 Very good.
01:12:34 Sure.
01:12:35 I'm glad he's getting getting work.
01:12:38 Yeah.
01:12:39 He's good.
01:12:40 He's a good guy.
01:12:41 He seems like it.
01:12:42 Yeah.
01:12:43 And he has videos.
01:12:44 He's got a pretty good voice.
01:12:45 I'm trying to discover what's going on in my life and trying to find myself.
01:12:50 You can see videos of him from like 12 years ago where he sounds exactly the same except
01:12:54 higher pitch.
01:12:55 You're making him sound like Kermit the Frog.
01:12:58 Yeah.
01:12:59 I always turn into that with really specific voices like that.
01:13:02 I always turn into Kermit the Frog.
01:13:04 Oh, I'm sorry.
01:13:06 George Lucas as well.
01:13:08 All right.
01:13:09 All right.
01:13:10 I might watch these.
01:13:11 But the explore with us guys.
01:13:12 Hello.
01:13:13 Welcome to our video.
01:13:14 This is one of those ones.
01:13:16 Is he more YouTuber?
01:13:17 Yeah.
01:13:18 He's definitely more tuberous.
01:13:19 She was stabbed and murdered.
01:13:22 That's not.
01:13:23 That's not my favorite.
01:13:24 No.
01:13:25 The following footage has been reviewed by a team of psychologists.
01:13:31 Cringe.
01:13:32 It's not too bad.
01:13:33 A team of psychologists gets involved.
01:13:36 And they inform random YouTuber what they think about crazy people.
01:13:42 Yeah.
01:13:43 Anyway, I don't know why I'm addicted to pro crime videos at the moment.
01:13:47 I, I like Jim can swim.
01:13:49 So how do we get on this topic?
01:13:54 I don't know.
01:13:55 We were talking about.
01:13:57 Where are we?
01:13:59 Right now.
01:14:00 And then a historian.
01:14:03 And then that's where the trail goes.
01:14:06 I don't remember anything before that.
01:14:10 Let's see.
01:14:12 Shit.
01:14:13 I don't really have any.
01:14:15 My, my PZP topic notes list was just how annoying and long and hard the work on the book is.
01:14:21 And I already complained about that.
01:14:23 So I was going to say, uh, I'm going to, yeah, I got to catch a train a little bit.
01:14:29 Cause I'm going home for my mom's birthday.
01:14:32 I made her another batch.
01:14:34 I made her another batch of gummy, gummy blocks.
01:14:37 This is a, this is better.
01:14:39 I have refined the recipe more.
01:14:41 This is, these are, these are better than the last ones.
01:14:44 Uh, they smell incredible.
01:14:46 It's been really hard not to eat them.
01:14:48 Have you not tasted one?
01:14:50 I did taste like, uh, I did, uh, eat a few of each like flavor that I made.
01:14:56 They were just really good and I just want to eat more of them.
01:14:59 Okay.
01:15:00 Uh, but I had, I had just, I had to stop.
01:15:03 It's like, no, I don't want to give her like a half empty container.
01:15:07 This is, this is, you've hit the limit.
01:15:10 It's a very nice present.
01:15:11 Something that you made yourself a big smile.
01:15:13 Yeah.
01:15:14 Unless there's shit in which case you fucked up.
01:15:17 I think they're good.
01:15:18 I think, I think they're good.
01:15:20 It would be a shame if like my parents think they're bad and don't actually like them,
01:15:24 but they're too polite to say it.
01:15:27 I don't know.
01:15:29 You know, I could have made, I, I considered, uh, since I know how to etch a glass now,
01:15:35 I could have, uh, oh yeah, I learned how to etch a glass.
01:15:39 With chemicals.
01:15:40 You can't just learn how to do that.
01:15:42 That's what computers do.
01:15:43 Nobody does that.
01:15:45 No, it's easy.
01:15:46 No, it's easy, bro.
01:15:47 They do that in big factories.
01:15:49 That doesn't happen in real life.
01:15:51 I was talking about this cause I, cause I made those, uh, those slime bottles and I etched
01:15:55 into the glass.
01:15:56 I etched the like product of New Los Angeles city, uh, into the slime bottles that I gave
01:16:01 out at RFC Kcon.
01:16:02 I was thinking I could maybe etch, uh, like a glass container or something, but I didn't
01:16:07 really have any appropriate, appropriately sized glass containers to present, uh, these,
01:16:13 this candy.
01:16:14 And so I thought, uh, maybe, maybe next time.
01:16:16 Ben's gummies.
01:16:17 Ben's gummies.
01:16:18 When do you keep all your, your gummy chemicals?
01:16:21 Are they just like in a cupboard?
01:16:23 They're just in a cupboard cause like, I don't really, I, I did get some weird stuff, but
01:16:28 I ended up not using most of it.
01:16:30 I just use.
01:16:31 You got, you got like eggs, bread, milk, monosaccharides.
01:16:35 Yeah.
01:16:36 Well, now I use, uh, it's all I really use is sugar, sugar.
01:16:41 I don't really use the pectin anymore, uh, sugar, corn, fiber, corn syrup.
01:16:47 Actually, actually, no, I ordered a big bucket.
01:16:49 I have a big bucket of corn syrup, 50 pounds.
01:16:52 That's all you need.
01:16:54 Yeah.
01:16:55 Uh, I mean, it's cheaper to buy in bulk.
01:16:57 So, uh, sugar, corn, fiber, uh, corn, corn starch, uh, uh, water.
01:17:05 Uh, uh, citric acid.
01:17:08 And then I have a little box full of like flavors and colors.
01:17:11 And like, that's it.
01:17:12 There we go.
01:17:13 Did I forget, did I forget anything?
01:17:14 Wait a second.
01:17:15 Like, consult my notes.
01:17:18 Consult my master, my master list.
01:17:21 The weirdest thing I've ever known anyone to do is just know, just knows how to make
01:17:25 gummies.
01:17:26 Just household the ingredients anytime.
01:17:28 They're so easy.
01:17:29 It only took me like two years to figure it out.
01:17:31 Oh, gelatin.
01:17:32 Oh, of course gelatin.
01:17:33 You mastered it in two years.
01:17:35 I ran out.
01:17:36 I ran out of a gelatin.
01:17:38 I feel like I just bought like a big box of like 500 sheets.
01:17:42 I got the platinum.
01:17:43 I got the platinum sheets this time.
01:17:45 Oh, very nice.
01:17:46 The difference between platinum and like other grades, basically that's the highest grade.
01:17:53 The difference is basically just like one sheet, one sheet of platinum gelatin has as much
01:18:01 solidifying, gelling power as one sheet of, you know, gold or silver or bronze or whatever.
01:18:08 It's just, I think the other ones are like less pure.
01:18:11 Right.
01:18:12 And so there's like, there's more impurities in them.
01:18:16 It's condensed gelatin power, basically.
01:18:19 Yeah.
01:18:20 But like, it actually, it actually ends up that buying the platinum is like more, it's
01:18:26 like less expensive because like, because there's less impurities, it weighs less.
01:18:31 So you get more in the box that costs like, the box costs a little more, but you get more
01:18:37 sheets and therefore you get more gelling power and it's actually more cost effective to buy
01:18:41 the better stuff.
01:18:42 Right.
01:18:43 In addition to being pure and better.
01:18:45 And yummy.
01:18:46 So, so, but I'm out.
01:18:48 I ran out of, use the last of it, making this.
01:18:52 You need more platinum gelatin, my friend.
01:18:55 You need more platinum 240 bloom, baby.
01:19:00 Platinum.
01:19:01 Genatin sounds like a good band name.
01:19:03 Platinum.
01:19:04 Platinum gelatin does.
01:19:05 Damn.
01:19:06 That is good.
01:19:07 I've always had rules.
01:19:08 Do you have any band names in your head that I don't play musical instruments, but I have
01:19:12 like a band name in my head that if I ever through some circumstance needed to name a band,
01:19:17 I've always got one on the standby.
01:19:19 Do you have one of those?
01:19:21 I don't.
01:19:22 What's yours?
01:19:23 Radical gasket.
01:19:24 Come on.
01:19:25 That's perfect.
01:19:26 That's pretty good.
01:19:27 Yeah.
01:19:28 It's pretty fucking perfect.
01:19:29 Would it be like a sounds like maybe a punk band or something?
01:19:33 Yeah.
01:19:34 Maybe also alternative rock, you know, anything, whatever.
01:19:38 Yeah.
01:19:39 Sure.
01:19:40 Yeah.
01:19:41 I am completely non musical in any way.
01:19:42 So I don't know why I came up with that.
01:19:44 Well, I guess mine is platinum gelatin now because I really like that.
01:19:47 Yeah.
01:19:48 It's good.
01:19:49 That rules.
01:19:50 That could be the name of like an outro song to an anime.
01:19:53 I can really easily see that.
01:19:55 I use the last of my, uh, my 600 sheets.
01:20:02 I made this, I made the stuff, you know, for my mom's birthday present and I had a little
01:20:06 bit left over and I was like, well, okay, I'll just use the last of it.
01:20:10 And I use the last of it.
01:20:12 And I decided, okay, well, I also have a little bit of cola flavor emulsion.
01:20:17 So I'll use the last of my cola flavor emulsion to flavor the last batch.
01:20:21 And I forgot that I hate the cola flavor emulsion.
01:20:24 It sucks.
01:20:25 It tastes bad.
01:20:26 So I just threw it out.
01:20:27 I wasted it.
01:20:28 But at least I, but at least I got rid of that bottle.
01:20:32 That goddamn emulsion.
01:20:34 God damn emulsion.
01:20:35 Just taking up, taking up so much space and it's little like one ounce bottle.
01:20:40 I'm finally free of it.
01:20:43 You need to start like a community in Boston of gummy makers.
01:20:47 Oh, wait, wait.
01:20:49 You know what?
01:20:50 That's great news though.
01:20:51 Gummy making convention.
01:20:53 They had, they had discontinued the worm molds, like the specific worm molds that I like.
01:21:00 They only had shitty ones that like were shaped weird for some reason.
01:21:05 And I don't know why they would make them stupid and bad like that.
01:21:11 But they did.
01:21:12 But now guess what?
01:21:14 They're back in stock.
01:21:15 They're back, baby.
01:21:16 We're back, baby.
01:21:18 They're back in stock and I'm debating, oh, should I, should I just buy like 10 of them?
01:21:24 Like, so I'll never run out.
01:21:26 Probably probably need to.
01:21:30 The fact that they came back once probably means that they would come back again.
01:21:34 If they get discontinued, maybe I'd buy like one more, one more set.
01:21:38 Oh, there's like the perfect gummy worm shape.
01:21:41 These are the perfect gummy worm shape.
01:21:43 They're, you know, they're, they're S curve.
01:21:45 They got that nice S curve.
01:21:47 What, do they get like worn out and stop working or something when you need to replace them?
01:21:52 I just want, I just wanted more.
01:21:54 I just wanted to be able to make more at once.
01:21:56 You were to make an absurd amount of gummies.
01:21:59 Wait, here.
01:22:01 Compare that, compare that to this garbage.
01:22:04 I mean, you could get this, which is like a good, a good shape.
01:22:09 Like this is a good shape, but it comes with all this bullshit.
01:22:12 Oh yeah.
01:22:13 Who the fuck wants to make gummy dolphins?
01:22:16 Gummy dolphins and starfish.
01:22:18 Oh, the gummy octopus is kind of cute.
01:22:20 Oh, the octopus, like whatever.
01:22:23 I eat the gummy octopus.
01:22:25 They're wormy.
01:22:27 Yeah, I mean, so that's all fine and whatever, but like just please, I'm here for the worms obviously.
01:22:33 I'm here for the worms.
01:22:34 We're ruining our gummy worm.
01:22:36 Please stop wasting my time.
01:22:39 And then this is the other ones you can get that are just worms look like this.
01:22:46 And I mean, I feel like this speaks for itself.
01:22:51 Yeah, no, not right.
01:22:53 They have heads, that's so stupid.
01:22:56 Those are gummy sperms, those are different.
01:22:59 What's going on with like the uneven curve?
01:23:02 I know.
01:23:03 Why do they like bend all, they have like a big like S-curve at the back and why?
01:23:08 And a really straight neck.
01:23:09 It's so weird.
01:23:10 I hate it.
01:23:11 Gummy snakes or sperms, those aren't gummy worms.
01:23:14 Frankly, frankly, these are no worms at all.
01:23:18 I can't stand it.
01:23:20 So I'm glad to see the good old modern gummy, 20 cavity candy kit back in stock.
01:23:30 Finally available.
01:23:32 Finally, finally, I might buy another one just as a treat.
01:23:38 Another set of two.
01:23:40 I treated myself to a Lego set recently just to have on my desk and you're treating yourself to gummy building.
01:23:47 I mean, I mean, I mean, same same same idea.
01:23:52 I think a little while ago, I was feeling kind of down.
01:23:59 And I think it was partially because I hadn't made any gummies in a while.
01:24:05 Like I I think I had like sort of been like just working on the book and not doing anything outside of that.
01:24:11 And I think I was just like, and then I don't know, you got to have you got to have a hobby.
01:24:18 You do.
01:24:19 So I think I, yeah, I don't know.
01:24:23 It brings me a small amount of joy in this dark, fucked up world.
01:24:30 Yeah, I've been playing a lot of multiverses recently because big product.
01:24:36 It's the Warner Brothers Smash Brothers fighting game thingy.
01:24:41 Have you not seen this?
01:24:43 No, it's a it's a big free to play.
01:24:47 Like Smash Brothers style game we can play as all the Warner Brothers characters.
01:24:52 My main is our Finn the human and Wonder Woman.
01:24:58 Finn the human is a Warner Brothers.
01:25:00 Yeah, because he's Carti Network and that's owned by Warner Brothers.
01:25:03 Oh, I didn't know that.
01:25:04 It's a it's good.
01:25:06 It's a really good little free fighting game.
01:25:08 And it's a it's going massive at the moment.
01:25:11 Have you not seen this?
01:25:13 No, I have.
01:25:14 Well, maybe maybe I did, but I didn't pay much attention.
01:25:17 Yeah, didn't like Nickelodeon make a like Smash like that?
01:25:21 Yes, they did, but it's been sort of killed now.
01:25:26 Oh, no one cares.
01:25:27 We added voice acting to that.
01:25:29 And that's good.
01:25:31 But the problem is that game just doesn't play great.
01:25:35 It's cool for what it is, you know, it's just like it's good, but it's not great.
01:25:41 Whereas multiverses feels really, really good.
01:25:45 Hmm.
01:25:46 And it's got lots of pretty solid lots of cool people in it.
01:25:50 And it's not just like Carti Network stuff.
01:25:52 There's tons of dog shit.
01:25:53 Hang on.
01:25:54 Let me send the Ross.
01:25:55 Multiverses.
01:25:56 I guess.
01:25:57 Yeah.
01:25:58 Yeah.
01:25:59 No, I think maybe I did see this somewhere.
01:26:03 I like playing as Finn, Jake and Wonder Woman.
01:26:07 Tasmanian devil versus Superman.
01:26:12 Sure.
01:26:13 Why not?
01:26:15 It's a it's really fun.
01:26:16 They recently added LeBron James.
01:26:19 Yeah.
01:26:20 Cool.
01:26:21 Yeah.
01:26:23 You shouldn't be surprised, but there's dog shit like that in it.
01:26:28 I don't know.
01:26:31 Shaggy.
01:26:32 Okay.
01:26:33 We got Shaggy, of course.
01:26:35 Shaggy is.
01:26:36 Do you remember there was memes of Shaggy if he was a Dragon Ball character?
01:26:39 Ultra.
01:26:40 I remember Ultra Instinct Shaggy.
01:26:42 Does he go Ultra Instinct?
01:26:43 Yeah.
01:26:44 He like powers up and starts glowing and stuff in multiverses.
01:26:46 That's I guess.
01:26:48 I guess that's kind of funny.
01:26:49 I guess.
01:26:50 I guess that's a little late.
01:26:52 Yeah.
01:26:55 Yeah.
01:26:56 Rick and Morty are being added soon, I think.
01:26:59 You can act out Scoob and Shag.
01:27:01 You can.
01:27:02 Because Bugs Bunny and Shaggy are both here.
01:27:04 And those are the only two characters in Scoob and Shaggy.
01:27:11 Arya Stark from Game of Thrones.
01:27:14 Really?
01:27:15 Yeah.
01:27:16 Voiced by the girl who played her in the TV show.
01:27:20 Oh, so like there's a lot that aren't on this image, I guess.
01:27:23 Oh, no.
01:27:24 She's there.
01:27:25 She's there on that image.
01:27:26 Wait, where?
01:27:27 Next to Velma.
01:27:28 Oh, like my eyes completely glossed over.
01:27:30 Yeah.
01:27:31 Arya Stark.
01:27:34 This is so fucking weird.
01:27:36 It is really weird.
01:27:37 But okay.
01:27:38 Who is Rain Dog?
01:27:39 I've never seen that one.
01:27:40 They seem to have like original characters that they're adding.
01:27:44 Just to fill out the roster of like.
01:27:46 Okay.
01:27:47 He's like a support thing where like if you get knocked off the stage,
01:27:50 he can pull you back in and things like that.
01:27:52 Hmm.
01:27:53 Oh, fine.
01:27:54 It feels like we need marketable dog type character for game.
01:27:58 It feels a little like that.
01:28:02 I feel like.
01:28:04 I don't know.
01:28:05 There's.
01:28:09 There's relatively few properties represented on this roster.
01:28:14 To be fair.
01:28:15 And some of them have multiple characters from them.
01:28:18 Yeah.
01:28:19 It's only an open beta at the moment.
01:28:21 Oh, okay.
01:28:22 It's not like the full release.
01:28:24 And I think they've said that they're going to keep adding characters as long as they can.
01:28:28 You know.
01:28:29 Yeah.
01:28:30 I'm pretty sure Gandalf is datamined.
01:28:36 Okay.
01:28:37 I think Gandalf and Neo are definitely coming.
01:28:40 Oh my God.
01:28:41 Mad Max was leaked.
01:28:43 But I don't think.
01:28:45 I don't think that'll go through.
01:28:49 Something about.
01:28:50 I heard some rumors of Ben 10.
01:28:52 I hope Ben 10 gets in.
01:28:54 That'd be cool.
01:28:55 How recently did this game go to open beta?
01:29:00 The open beta started on the 26th.
01:29:03 So like a week ago.
01:29:05 Oh, okay.
01:29:06 And I see the there was an early alpha for it.
01:29:10 And then there was an early access to the open beta.
01:29:13 So if you got into the open into the closed alpha,
01:29:16 then you got early access to the beta.
01:29:18 So I played it a few weeks before it came out in open.
01:29:21 But yeah.
01:29:23 But it is really fun.
01:29:25 It looks really strange.
01:29:26 Yeah.
01:29:27 It is.
01:29:28 Who's your main?
01:29:30 Finn.
01:29:31 Finn Human.
01:29:32 Because he's kind of like.
01:29:35 If I was to compare him like a Smash Brothers character,
01:29:38 he's kind of like mass combined with a hero.
01:29:41 He's really weird.
01:29:43 He has like a shop mechanic where you collect gold as you damage people.
01:29:47 And then you can use his down special to buy things from the shop,
01:29:50 like a speed boost, a defense thing.
01:29:53 And then you can buy BMO,
01:29:54 which lets you do like a super attack,
01:29:56 which does tons of damage.
01:29:58 Very cool.
01:29:59 It sounds adorable.
01:30:00 It is great.
01:30:01 And they got all the voice actors for everybody,
01:30:04 apart from LeBron James.
01:30:06 LeBron James is the only person.
01:30:10 He doesn't.
01:30:11 They couldn't get him to voice himself?
01:30:13 No.
01:30:14 He's voiced by the guy who voices Barrett in Final Fantasy VII remake.
01:30:19 Cool.
01:30:20 They got Superman to voice Superman, you know,
01:30:22 the real Superman.
01:30:23 They actually got him, I can't believe it.
01:30:25 Oh, they got the real Clark Kent?
01:30:27 Yeah, they got him.
01:30:28 I don't know where they found him, but they got him.
01:30:31 My favorite thing about the game is that when Tom and Jerry get knocked off the screen,
01:30:36 it plays the scream, the Tom and Jerry scream.
01:30:39 Yeah, yeah.
01:30:41 Which is a...
01:30:42 What does Velma do?
01:30:44 What does Velma do in a battle against Batman?
01:30:48 Did you ever see Phoenix Wright in Marvel vs Capcom?
01:30:54 Not really.
01:30:56 Where he does like attacks where it makes like a speech bubble.
01:31:00 And that like is the hit box.
01:31:02 So like Velma is like sass, deduction and something like that.
01:31:06 And Jinkies it says in like speech bubbles and it hits you and stuff.
01:31:11 I see, I see, I see.
01:31:13 One of her attacks is based on like the little like charge up and run they always do in Scooby-Doo
01:31:17 when they're running away from throwing things.
01:31:19 And she like holds her hands completely straight and then her legs like wheel.
01:31:22 Oh, like Sonic the Hedgehog?
01:31:25 Yeah.
01:31:26 Legs whirlwind, gotcha.
01:31:28 If you like hit someone while they're in that, you like grab them and then throw them off the stage.
01:31:32 That...
01:31:34 Her main mechanic is really weird.
01:31:36 It's like you collect evidence around the stage and then when you collect enough it will summon a police car
01:31:42 and like grab the opponent and reveal that it was Mr. Jenkins all along.
01:31:47 It was old man Jenkins.
01:31:48 Like you pull the enemy, you pull your opponent's mask off?
01:31:51 Yeah, but it doesn't like show you pulling their mask off.
01:31:54 It like just puts them in a police car and then like it shows like a little icon of their character's face
01:31:58 and it flips over and it's old man Jenkins.
01:32:00 I see, I see.
01:32:01 And then it like throws them off the stage in the police car.
01:32:04 That...
01:32:06 That's so funny.
01:32:07 Oh my god.
01:32:08 It sounds pretty fun.
01:32:09 I'm just really...
01:32:10 I'm bad at fighting games though.
01:32:12 Oh, me too.
01:32:13 It's too late.
01:32:14 Yeah.
01:32:15 It's too late for me to get good at them.
01:32:17 I've always said to like fighting games you have to have liked fighting games for the past five years.
01:32:23 It feels, it feels that way.
01:32:25 You know what I mean?
01:32:26 It's impossible to catch up.
01:32:28 Yeah, I'll never do it at this point.
01:32:31 Oh well.
01:32:33 But I mean, I'm very, I'm, I'm you, I'm entertained by what I'm seeing.
01:32:40 Yeah.
01:32:41 I was very surprised by how much I liked playing as Garnet.
01:32:45 I'm not, I don't remember anything about Steven Universe.
01:32:49 I watched like half of it and I've completely forgotten it now.
01:32:52 But she's really good at this in multi-person.
01:32:56 I never finished Steven Universe.
01:32:58 I made it to like almost the end and then I stopped watching like literally like six episodes before the end.
01:33:05 And then I saw the movie, the one with the, with the...
01:33:11 The good drawings.
01:33:13 The clown girl, Harley Quinn.
01:33:16 What's your name?
01:33:18 I don't know.
01:33:20 I know who you're talking about.
01:33:21 I don't know.
01:33:22 Spinel, Spinal.
01:33:23 Oh, okay.
01:33:24 And then I never saw, and I think there was another movie.
01:33:27 I think there was a series afterwards, like a little like epilogue series.
01:33:30 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:33:31 There was like a post-timeskip series.
01:33:34 Oh, I never saw the post-timeskip like post-series adventure time movie either.
01:33:39 Oh, there's four of those.
01:33:41 Really?
01:33:42 They're really good.
01:33:43 I like, I like adventure time a lot.
01:33:46 I don't know.
01:33:47 And I never watched, I never watched the movies.
01:33:49 There's four?
01:33:50 What the fuck?
01:33:51 They're hour-long specials and they all focus on like a different character.
01:33:56 The one criticism I have for them is they release them in the wrong order.
01:34:01 The third one definitely should have been the fourth one,
01:34:04 because the third one is the Finn and Jake one.
01:34:07 And that should have been last?
01:34:09 Yeah, that should have been the last one, because of the way it ends.
01:34:12 I don't want to spoil it, but it's pretty good.
01:34:14 Okay, yeah, don't spoil it.
01:34:16 I'll, I'll, I should watch it.
01:34:18 The first one's BMO.
01:34:19 The second one's Marceline and Princess Bubblegarden.
01:34:22 The third one's Finn and Jake.
01:34:24 And then the last one is Peppermint Butler, which should have been like,
01:34:27 come on, that should have been before the Finn and Jake one.
01:34:31 I mean, I don't know how that it ends.
01:34:33 Yeah.
01:34:34 It, it, it makes sense.
01:34:37 I get it.
01:34:38 I get why it's like a little joke.
01:34:40 Yeah.
01:34:41 It's funny.
01:34:42 It's cute.
01:34:43 Yeah, it is for cute.
01:34:44 Yeah.
01:34:45 But those are very good.
01:34:47 And everyone should watch them.
01:34:50 Yeah.
01:34:51 I forgot.
01:34:52 I forgot those existed until right now.
01:34:55 Finn and Jake one in particular might be one of my favorite,
01:34:58 like bits of adventure time.
01:35:00 I think it is just great and perfect.
01:35:02 I started a little while ago.
01:35:04 I did watch, I rewatched some of the beginning of Adventure Time.
01:35:08 And it's good.
01:35:10 And people say that it just makes me happy.
01:35:13 Bad.
01:35:14 People say, people say that it gets bad.
01:35:17 And I'll admit there are some underwhelming episodes, but like,
01:35:22 I remember even watching like late stage Adventure Time and knowing
01:35:29 that like it had a reputation that like, oh, it kind of,
01:35:31 it kind of gets bad.
01:35:32 It goes off the deep end.
01:35:33 It gets like up its own ass with its lore.
01:35:36 Yeah.
01:35:37 It's boring.
01:35:38 But I remember watching Ladder Day Adventure Time and knowing that.
01:35:41 People say that, but being like, nah, I'm entertained anyway.
01:35:45 I'm having a great time and it rules.
01:35:47 What I appreciate is they like commit to that lore.
01:35:50 Like they still reference things like that.
01:35:53 Like especially in the, in that last episode thingy that I was talking about,
01:35:56 they reference the fact that Finn is a reincarnated Comet and has like
01:36:00 tons of past lives and shit like that.
01:36:02 And all that weird shit that they came up with.
01:36:05 And, but they do it in like a cute little like nod way.
01:36:08 Like, yeah, it's kind of weird.
01:36:10 He accepts it because he's Finn.
01:36:12 So, you know, he doesn't give a shit.
01:36:14 The, the, um, they really, they really just,
01:36:18 they really just committed to all that weird shit and they ran with them.
01:36:24 They treated it completely seriously.
01:36:26 And I respect it.
01:36:29 I don't love the final villain of the actual series of Adventure Time
01:36:33 where it's just like some God guy that you see in one episode like earlier
01:36:37 that someone summons and is bad.
01:36:39 And I was like, that's kind of weird.
01:36:41 Wait, I don't even, I don't even remember.
01:36:44 It was a big red guy that, um, the bad bubblegum man summons or something.
01:36:50 I think it's called Grodd.
01:36:52 Oh.
01:36:55 Yeah, the one, oh God.
01:36:58 Yeah, it's called Gold.
01:36:59 The one that he sees like when he dies.
01:37:01 Yeah.
01:37:02 Yes.
01:37:03 Well, he's like a, some kind of force in nature or something.
01:37:07 Yeah, it's just like an Eldritch God thing, but I think that's, you know,
01:37:12 I either set it up a bit more or just make it a little bit more interesting.
01:37:16 I don't know.
01:37:17 Well, he's mysterious.
01:37:18 Well, he's mysterious.
01:37:19 Yeah, I suppose so.
01:37:21 Uh, the, the, uh, fuck, I was going to say something about, um,
01:37:29 Early Adventure Time?
01:37:30 I do think it gets a little too invested in the sort of like, sometimes when it was
01:37:40 really going deep on like the, oh, there's a recurring cycle of fire and ice and candy
01:37:45 and slime and, and we will, we will, we will explore the like reincarnated versions of
01:37:51 these concepts over and over again.
01:37:53 Sometimes I thought like they could just left some of that out and it would have been fine.
01:37:59 I didn't really need like, oh, who was the previous, who was the previous ice person?
01:38:07 Yeah.
01:38:08 I don't know.
01:38:09 I don't care.
01:38:10 Where did the crown come from?
01:38:12 I mean, whatever.
01:38:13 I just assumed it was, you know, an evil crown.
01:38:16 Oh, an evil.
01:38:17 Oh, okay.
01:38:18 Now I know it was an evil crown that was made, made by a guy.
01:38:23 Made by an ice guy that was programmed to imprint his brain onto it or something.
01:38:28 And it turns anyone into him, into a crazy version of him.
01:38:33 I'm glad, I'm glad that I know that it was not just an evil crown.
01:38:38 That makes you a crazy ice man.
01:38:40 It's an evil crown with some other guy's personality.
01:38:43 That's like, that changes, changes everything.
01:38:46 Sure.
01:38:47 It's a bit, what does that, what does that remind me of a bit of like, I'm gonna, I'm
01:38:53 gonna explain this shit to you even if it really requires no further explanation.
01:38:59 The Master Sword in Zelda has that.
01:39:02 Yeah.
01:39:03 In Skyward Sword, that whole game is about explaining where the Master Sword came from and who's
01:39:08 in it.
01:39:09 Oh, maybe that is.
01:39:10 Yeah.
01:39:11 Maybe that is what I'm thinking of.
01:39:12 Yeah.
01:39:13 A fucking, it's got that like AI lady.
01:39:15 Yeah.
01:39:16 That's the first example that comes into my mind.
01:39:18 I didn't play Skyward Sword, but I know what you're talking about.
01:39:20 And that is a good example of like, did we really need the Master Sword need a backstory?
01:39:26 I mean, it's, it's worse in that case because they made a whole game.
01:39:29 Yeah.
01:39:30 And like, that's the kind of like, story of a whole game that you spend.
01:39:35 This is just like, there's a, there's a couple extraneous episodes in like a 75 episode show
01:39:42 or however many it is.
01:39:44 They're doing that with Dragon Ball a lot lately where they're like, oh, we need to show more
01:39:48 and more of Goku's dad.
01:39:49 It's like, he doesn't matter.
01:39:50 He doesn't matter.
01:39:51 Yeah.
01:39:52 Yeah.
01:39:53 Like if in one piece they did like an entire like flashback arc about Luffy's mom, like
01:39:57 no, I don't really, you know, I don't need that.
01:40:01 I haven't been, I haven't not been keeping up with one piece.
01:40:05 I assumed not.
01:40:07 I've been seeing a lot.
01:40:09 I feel like I've been seeing more one piece discussion.
01:40:12 Yeah.
01:40:13 On online than usual lately.
01:40:15 I see it.
01:40:16 I see it come up and people are talking about what happened in the latest chapter and maybe
01:40:21 I should, I don't know, kind of makes me want to maybe stay current so I can know what people
01:40:25 are talking about.
01:40:26 It's because the one walk is like over now, basically.
01:40:29 Yeah.
01:40:30 I think that everyone's like excited to see what comes next.
01:40:33 The discussions come up because there's lots of like hints at what's happening in the outside
01:40:38 world at the moment.
01:40:39 So there's a lot of stuff to talk about that.
01:40:41 That is, that is interesting.
01:40:43 Yeah.
01:40:45 Okay, I should catch up on that.
01:40:48 Maybe I'll catch up with it on the train.
01:40:51 Oh yeah, that's a good idea.
01:40:53 Actually, I probably won't have enough time on the train, but it's okay.
01:40:56 You can get like halfway there.
01:40:58 Yeah.
01:41:02 Okay, okay, okay.
01:41:04 Some things are good.
01:41:06 Some media properties can be good sometimes.
01:41:08 Yeah.
01:41:09 Adventure time, really good.
01:41:11 I do love adventure time.
01:41:12 It makes me smile.
01:41:13 Overall, I would have to say it's really good.
01:41:15 I really like that stupid mini series with Finn's mom.
01:41:18 I don't know why I like that one a lot.
01:41:20 The one with like the islands with the humans on it?
01:41:23 Yeah.
01:41:24 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:41:25 That series had a good tone.
01:41:28 I didn't want to watch any of Pendleton Ward's other shows.
01:41:38 No.
01:41:39 There's like that space one.
01:41:41 And then there's the space one, and there's the one on Netflix,
01:41:45 which is like a drug trip thing.
01:41:47 The space one about four guys in space or whatever.
01:41:51 Who look like adventure time guys.
01:41:53 Yeah.
01:41:54 And they have like a cute mascot.
01:41:56 I heard there was a new...
01:41:58 Yeah, I think I heard about the Netflix one.
01:42:01 I haven't seen it.
01:42:02 I don't even know what it looks like.
01:42:04 My friend really hates it, but it's definitely not his thing.
01:42:07 So I bet I would really love it.
01:42:10 Hmm.
01:42:11 Is it called Midnight Gospel?
01:42:13 That's the one.
01:42:14 Okay.
01:42:15 I saw one episode of that and I hated it.
01:42:17 Okay.
01:42:18 I've heard it's good.
01:42:20 I've heard people tell me that it's good.
01:42:22 I think it's a Marmite situation where you love it or you hate it.
01:42:25 I think it's the...
01:42:26 I saw one episode of it and I thought it sucked.
01:42:32 But I don't know.
01:42:33 That's exactly what my friend said.
01:42:35 I've always been curious.
01:42:37 I might give it a go and see.
01:42:41 I...
01:42:42 No, don't.
01:42:45 I think...
01:42:47 I swear I tried to go into it with an open mind.
01:42:49 Okay.
01:42:50 Something about the premise of it...
01:42:53 irritates me.
01:42:56 And then...
01:42:57 But I was like...
01:42:58 I'm gonna...
01:42:59 But I've heard it's good.
01:43:00 So I swear I'm good.
01:43:01 I'm not gonna hold it against it.
01:43:02 I'm gonna just see what it has to offer me.
01:43:04 And I did not like what was served.
01:43:10 It's like he talks to people about stuff
01:43:15 and then they animate like a fantastical magical mystery space world
01:43:20 over that.
01:43:22 Right.
01:43:23 I don't know.
01:43:24 That blows.
01:43:25 I hate that.
01:43:28 I don't get what's cool about that at all.
01:43:33 What if you do the drug?
01:43:34 It make it entertaining.
01:43:36 I...
01:43:37 That better not be the argument for it.
01:43:42 The only...
01:43:43 I don't know.
01:43:44 The only thing that I think...
01:43:45 I mean...
01:43:46 I would want like does the world that it takes place
01:43:48 and does it have lore?
01:43:50 But like they're not talking about that stuff.
01:43:53 They're not talking about like some like fantasy world lore.
01:43:56 They're talking about like real shit in the real world.
01:44:00 So why is it set in a magical like drug trip space land?
01:44:05 Ben, it's a beautiful juxtaposition.
01:44:08 Don't you understand?
01:44:09 Is it?
01:44:10 Yes.
01:44:11 I mean, maybe.
01:44:12 No, I don't know.
01:44:13 Maybe, maybe.
01:44:16 Well, my initial impressions have been poor.
01:44:21 You can tell.
01:44:22 That reminds me of like how all the gorilla songs are just like about like living in L.A.
01:44:26 and being an artist.
01:44:27 And then like all the music videos is just like weird wacky like alien shit happening.
01:44:32 You know what?
01:44:33 That's fair.
01:44:34 Yeah.
01:44:35 I mean, some of them are about kind of abstract things.
01:44:40 That's true.
01:44:41 Yeah.
01:44:42 What is...
01:44:43 I just like...
01:44:44 What is Clint Eastwood about?
01:44:46 Yeah, that's true.
01:44:48 What's the one with the windmills?
01:44:50 Feel Good Ink.
01:44:52 What's Feel Good Ink about?
01:44:54 Corporate, uh...
01:44:57 Corporate.
01:44:58 Yeah, exactly.
01:44:59 That's the vibe I get.
01:45:01 Yeah.
01:45:05 Forced happiness, I don't know.
01:45:08 Uh, I haven't really, you know, I'm not like a...
01:45:12 I've listened to a bunch of gorillas.
01:45:14 I don't know all their songs.
01:45:16 Are a lot of their songs about being an artist living in L.A.?
01:45:20 Yeah, a lot of their more recent stuff have been about like...
01:45:25 To me, they've come off as just about the experience of being a musician and things like that.
01:45:31 Or...
01:45:32 Yeah.
01:45:33 And then there's the occasional abstract one where it's just nonsense.
01:45:38 They all sound really good.
01:45:40 Got to write what you know.
01:45:41 You got to have something to draw on to like what am I going to make a song about?
01:45:45 Yeah.
01:45:46 I don't know.
01:45:47 Interesting.
01:45:48 I still like gorillas a lot.
01:45:49 They did a whole album which was very clearly just a big criticism of the state of America.
01:45:54 Oh.
01:45:55 And that kind of thing.
01:45:57 Recently?
01:45:58 It was the 2017 one, I think it was.
01:46:01 Humans.
01:46:02 Which is good about like...
01:46:04 Thing bad.
01:46:05 This shit bad, yo.
01:46:07 Maybe there's...
01:46:09 Maybe once in a while, Midnight Gospel might sort of stumble into a conversation about some real world thing
01:46:18 that like thematically really matches and resonates with some sort of like trippy imagery that they animated for it.
01:46:27 I mean, I guess I could see that happen.
01:46:29 It obviously doesn't happen all the time.
01:46:32 Yeah.
01:46:33 But maybe there are some bangers.
01:46:34 I don't know.
01:46:35 Yeah, whatever.
01:46:37 Whatever.
01:46:38 Whatever.
01:46:39 Pendle some war.
01:46:40 Do what you want.
01:46:41 I don't give a shit.
01:46:42 I don't give a watch.
01:46:43 I actually didn't know he was involved in that one.
01:46:47 That's the only other thing that I know he's worked on.
01:46:50 Aside from that Space One, which I think was like a YouTube series.
01:46:55 I did not know that he had anything to do with that, actually.
01:47:00 I knew it was that guy, Alex Hirsch, was the guy who's like voice it is.
01:47:05 Ah.
01:47:06 And I thought it was maybe that guy Moynihan.
01:47:10 I know Moynihan is one of like the designers and animators on Adventure Time.
01:47:16 I can tell that Moynihan had like a hand in the art style on Midnight Gospel.
01:47:23 What does Pendleton Ward do?
01:47:26 Now.
01:47:27 On that.
01:47:28 What's.
01:47:29 Hmm.
01:47:30 I got to find out.
01:47:34 I mean, nobody writes for it.
01:47:39 Co-created.
01:47:40 What the fuck does that mean?
01:47:42 Co-created with a guy called Duncan Trussell.
01:47:45 Oh, wait.
01:47:46 Duncan Trussell.
01:47:47 That's the...
01:47:48 Wait, shit.
01:47:49 That's who I meant to say when I said Alex Hirsch.
01:47:51 So who the fuck is Alex Hirsch?
01:47:53 Maybe he's not involved.
01:47:54 Alex Hirsch is the Gravity Falls guy, and I didn't think he was involved with it.
01:47:58 Oh, yeah.
01:47:59 I was looking at his Wikipedia.
01:48:00 No, Duncan Trussell is the guy whose voice it is.
01:48:03 Yeah.
01:48:04 I saw Alex Hirsch tweeting out all the notes that he got from Disney when he was making
01:48:08 Gravity Falls, which was very funny.
01:48:10 Yeah, I saw some of that.
01:48:12 That was a good little insight into how fucking horrible this shit is.
01:48:19 Hmm.
01:48:20 They're just...
01:48:22 I don't remember...
01:48:24 Do you remember any details?
01:48:27 It was like, we're going to kick your butt, and it was like a note saying like, this phrase
01:48:33 is too similar to the phrase kick your ass, and we would prefer if they said something
01:48:38 else.
01:48:39 It was like really like minor shit like that.
01:48:41 They would change, and then of course...
01:48:43 You alluded to a swear word.
01:48:45 You didn't say a swear word, but it almost suggests one, and please...
01:48:49 And Alex Hirsch's response every time was just like, you're a fucking idiot.
01:48:55 Hmm.
01:48:57 Fascinating.
01:48:59 Yeah.
01:49:00 Fascinating.
01:49:01 God, I would never want to work in television.
01:49:05 Yeah, I see he's created by Pendleton Ward and Duncan Tressel, so I assume that means
01:49:12 Pendleton Ward.
01:49:14 He made some phone calls to make it happen.
01:49:16 He's like, let's make a thing.
01:49:18 He met Duncan Tressel, was like, hey, Pendleton Ward, great to finally meet you.
01:49:22 I have a podcast, and I'd really like to make a cartoon about it, and Pendleton Ward was
01:49:26 like, yeah, okay, let me call...
01:49:28 Is that what it is?
01:49:29 Is it like a cartoon of a podcast?
01:49:31 Let me call Moynihan, and he'll do some sketches for you, and then we...
01:49:36 Okay, all right, I'll see you.
01:49:38 Okay, bye.
01:49:39 Yeah, it's...
01:49:40 The one that I saw was he was interviewing a...
01:49:44 What do you call it?
01:49:46 Not an undertaker.
01:49:48 A taxidermist, but like...
01:49:51 What do you call it when you do like a human taxidermy?
01:49:54 When you prepare a body for a funeral?
01:49:58 A mummification.
01:50:01 No.
01:50:03 I know what you mean, but I don't know the word.
01:50:06 Embarming?
01:50:09 Wait, no, that's part of mummification.
01:50:11 That's part of it.
01:50:12 Sorry, I've got mummies on the brain.
01:50:18 Okay, what...
01:50:19 Hang on.
01:50:21 What do you call someone who works at a funeral home?
01:50:28 Mortician.
01:50:30 Yes, mortician, that is the word, yes.
01:50:33 Anyway, he was interviewing a mortician, and...
01:50:37 I don't know, she was just describing fucking...
01:50:41 What you do as a mortician, and what it means to be a mortician,
01:50:45 and what her experiences at a mortician are like,
01:50:48 and some of the cultural history of...
01:50:50 I think she was going into civil war era funeral practices,
01:50:56 historical things that have been considered normal at certain times
01:51:00 that we would consider bizarre today, etc.
01:51:03 It's fine.
01:51:05 It's okay, I guess.
01:51:07 It's fine, but I just don't care.
01:51:09 But why was it animated as they're going through some sort of space maze
01:51:17 with monsters chasing them?
01:51:19 I don't know.
01:51:20 I didn't understand what the point of it was.
01:51:23 Hang on, here's the good Gravity Falls one.
01:51:26 Do you remember those two gay cops in Gravity Falls?
01:51:30 They would get notes every time they were next to each other and stuff.
01:51:34 Please revise the action of Blubbs putting his arm around Durland
01:51:38 as noted in previous concerns that their affectionate relationship
01:51:40 should remain comical versus flirtatious.
01:51:43 Ah!
01:51:45 Ah!
01:51:47 Oh, that's good.
01:51:49 That's good.
01:51:51 No gayo.
01:51:53 There's the one of the...
01:51:55 This is not S&P approved, where it had some writing on a poster that they made them change,
01:52:01 and then they kept changing it and changing it and changing it,
01:52:03 and they kept refusing it every time,
01:52:05 and then they just put not S&P approved on the poster,
01:52:08 and then S&P replied,
01:52:11 not S&P approved has been approved.
01:52:14 Wait.
01:52:16 This bit is not standard and practices approved on the poster.
01:52:20 Oh, standard and practices.
01:52:22 So it was a poster on the wall?
01:52:24 Yeah, it was a poster on the wall.
01:52:26 Camera would have said originally, but they were made to change it,
01:52:28 and they changed it to something else,
01:52:30 and they wouldn't let them use that either,
01:52:32 so they just kept changing it,
01:52:34 and then eventually you just put not S&P approved on it,
01:52:36 and then there's the classic message,
01:52:38 not S&P approved has been approved by S&P.
01:52:41 I see.
01:52:43 Because they got away with that one.
01:52:45 I wonder if I can...
01:52:47 Can I Google image search the...
01:52:49 Yeah, if you just...
01:52:51 It's a party invitation.
01:52:53 Not S&P approved,
01:52:55 so photos better end up online.
01:52:59 Yeah, okay.
01:53:01 I can't remember what the original thing said.
01:53:03 It's in that video that you put out.
01:53:05 Yeah, that's what I want to know,
01:53:07 is like what...
01:53:09 They must have been some sort of
01:53:11 suggestion of saucy party activities.
01:53:15 It was Spin the Bottle.
01:53:17 It was Spin the Bottle.
01:53:19 Really? They can't mention Spin the Bottle?
01:53:21 It said Spin the Bottle and punch
01:53:23 at party or whatever.
01:53:26 And then they were like,
01:53:28 Spin the Bottle is alluding to kissing,
01:53:30 which is sexual, you can't put that in.
01:53:34 I think I...
01:53:35 You know what?
01:53:36 I think I have to vote Republican now.
01:53:38 I think cancel culture has gone too far,
01:53:40 and this is the fucking line.
01:53:42 This is the line that breaks me.
01:53:45 Yeah, but they wanted the cops to be gay then.
01:53:48 Which side are you on?
01:53:51 Ooh.
01:53:55 Wait, oh shit.
01:53:56 Damn it, should I hate them for being cops,
01:53:58 or should I love them and unconditionally
01:54:00 approve of everything they do because they're gay?
01:54:02 Ah, it's too...
01:54:04 Fucking Alex, her. She's a genius.
01:54:06 He's twisting our minds.
01:54:08 True.
01:54:09 You know what? I never finished
01:54:11 Gravity Falls either.
01:54:13 I watched a bunch of it.
01:54:15 I think...
01:54:16 It's one of the best. It's one of the best ones.
01:54:18 Well, there was a long hiatus,
01:54:20 and I never picked it up after the hiatus.
01:54:23 That's true.
01:54:24 Like, in between
01:54:27 Episode 10 of Season 2 and the rest,
01:54:30 I think it was.
01:54:31 Yeah, sounds about right.
01:54:33 I think I saw like two seasons of it.
01:54:35 But it was a...
01:54:37 Damn, it's the last 10 episodes.
01:54:39 Those are great.
01:54:40 The finale is the best episode.
01:54:42 It ends perfectly. It's great.
01:54:44 Yeah.
01:54:46 I think I maybe should have finished it.
01:54:49 Maybe I will at some point.
01:54:51 It's one of those...
01:54:52 It's like up there with Avatar,
01:54:54 in terms of just being like,
01:54:55 oh, it's planned out from the start.
01:54:56 It's only 40 episodes.
01:54:58 It's...
01:54:59 Damn.
01:55:00 It's exactly what it needs to be, you know?
01:55:02 I hope they never touch it again.
01:55:04 Don't fucking touch Gravity Falls.
01:55:05 Leave it as it was.
01:55:06 That's so funny.
01:55:07 That's so funny,
01:55:08 because it really doesn't look like that kind of show at all.
01:55:10 No.
01:55:11 It looks like...
01:55:12 It looks like something that would go on forever, you know?
01:55:15 Yeah.
01:55:16 Yeah.
01:55:17 And be like a...
01:55:18 Oh, it's SpongeBob.
01:55:19 Oh, they're at summer camp.
01:55:22 They work at a shop.
01:55:24 Yeah.
01:55:25 Crazy things happen.
01:55:26 It's a setup that could theoretically be stretched out
01:55:28 for Eternity.
01:55:29 Yeah.
01:55:30 It has a really good story and characters,
01:55:31 and a cool villain and things.
01:55:36 I like the episode with the mini-golf,
01:55:38 where they show the rich bitch girl
01:55:40 what's going on.
01:55:43 I did see that one.
01:55:46 I did see that one.
01:55:47 There's a bit where the big buff golf ball
01:55:49 is carrying it through the poison gas
01:55:51 my new toys,
01:55:53 and they don't address it.
01:55:55 He just straight up does sacrifice himself
01:55:57 to get the ball to the end of the course.
01:55:59 Well,
01:56:01 gotta do.
01:56:02 I don't know how that got passed
01:56:03 standard of practices,
01:56:04 but spin the bottle didn't.
01:56:07 Did he do Owl House or something?
01:56:11 Did he do the other show?
01:56:12 Yeah, I think he did Owl House or the frog one.
01:56:15 Yeah, those are two that I'm aware of,
01:56:17 and I haven't seen.
01:56:18 Those are two of that genre of show.
01:56:21 Owl House and Amphibia are two
01:56:25 Gravity Falls likes,
01:56:26 and one, I guess, is about birds,
01:56:27 and the other is about frogs,
01:56:29 and that's all I know about them.
01:56:32 Okay, I don't think Amphibia has anything
01:56:35 to do with Amphibia.
01:56:37 Okay.
01:56:38 I think I saw a clip of them referencing
01:56:40 Gravity Falls in Amphibia,
01:56:41 and that's what I'm thinking of.
01:56:44 Okay, whatever.
01:56:48 There's like Owl House,
01:56:49 Infinity Train,
01:56:51 and Amphibia.
01:56:52 Oh, Infinity Train.
01:56:53 Didn't that get canceled?
01:56:54 Yeah, I think so.
01:56:55 There's all those shows that I lump together
01:56:57 in my mind and get them confused constantly.
01:57:01 And I feel bad about it.
01:57:02 Yeah, they're all kind of sort of a...
01:57:06 Happy,
01:57:08 mopey, you know.
01:57:09 I don't know how to describe them.
01:57:11 The sort of Steven Universe.
01:57:13 Yeah.
01:57:14 Like comedy, action,
01:57:17 but with emotions in them.
01:57:19 Emotional little girl's cartoon.
01:57:21 That's it.
01:57:22 I guess Adventure Time is like that, too.
01:57:24 Did Adventure Time just lay the groundwork
01:57:26 for all of these?
01:57:27 Yeah, probably.
01:57:29 Yeah.
01:57:30 And then Steven Universe refined it
01:57:31 in a way that people really liked,
01:57:33 and then these new ones
01:57:34 have taken up the torch.
01:57:37 Yeah.
01:57:38 Yeah.
01:57:39 I don't know.
01:57:40 I fell off to Steven Universe
01:57:41 right after the human zoo bit, I think.
01:57:43 That's pretty far in, I think.
01:57:45 Yeah.
01:57:46 And I was like,
01:57:47 I don't care anymore.
01:57:49 Isn't...
01:57:50 I mean, when I hear Infinity Train,
01:57:53 I think about that one episode of Adventure Time
01:57:55 that has the Infinity Train in it.
01:57:57 Well, Train Dungeon.
01:57:58 Yeah, that one's good.
01:57:59 Yeah, like that's what I thought
01:58:01 Infinity Train was about.
01:58:03 Is that...
01:58:04 I don't know what Infinity Train is about.
01:58:06 Dungeon Train.
01:58:07 I don't either.
01:58:08 Dungeon Train.
01:58:09 I assume it's that.
01:58:10 Dungeon Train's cool, though.
01:58:11 Yeah.
01:58:12 I like the episode where Finn
01:58:13 falls into a pile of pillows
01:58:14 and lives out his entire life
01:58:16 with pillow people,
01:58:17 falls in love and has kids,
01:58:18 and then he comes back
01:58:19 and he's fine.
01:58:20 Yeah, and he sees Grubb.
01:58:21 Yeah.
01:58:22 He was set up.
01:58:23 He was set up.
01:58:25 That's true.
01:58:26 Oh, yeah.
01:58:27 That is where that one was set up.
01:58:28 You're right.
01:58:29 Yeah.
01:58:30 When he lives out his whole life
01:58:31 and then he dies of old age
01:58:32 in pillow world and his spirit
01:58:34 travels through dimensions past Grubb.
01:58:38 Yeah.
01:58:41 What's the in-between
01:58:43 between Adventure Time
01:58:44 and Steven Universe?
01:58:45 Because those were like a long time.
01:58:47 I would say probably Gravity Falls.
01:58:50 Gravity Falls was like 2012,
01:58:52 or 14 it started,
01:58:53 somewhere in between there.
01:58:55 That sounds about right.
01:58:57 I mean, I know Rebecca Sugar
01:58:58 worked on Adventure Time.
01:59:00 Yeah.
01:59:01 She did a lot of the hard-hitting ones.
01:59:04 And a lot of the ones with like the really good music in them.
01:59:07 Yeah.
01:59:08 Many of the hard-hitting ones were hard-hitting
01:59:10 because of the music,
01:59:11 but not all of them.
01:59:12 Everything I remember from Steven Universe
01:59:14 is the good music bits.
01:59:18 Those are the main things I remember from it.
01:59:21 I will say my main thing on Steven Universe
01:59:24 is it has the,
01:59:25 you know the idea of like a town cast?
01:59:29 Yeah.
01:59:30 The town is populated by wacky weird people
01:59:32 The town is populated by wacky weird characters.
01:59:35 Yeah.
01:59:36 I think Steven Universe
01:59:37 has the worst one of those I've ever seen
01:59:39 because I don't like any of them.
01:59:41 Yeah.
01:59:43 I'm trying to think.
01:59:45 Oh God.
01:59:46 I mean, yeah, there's like
01:59:48 Pizza Family and French Fry Family.
01:59:52 Everybody's favorite.
01:59:54 There's the Roberto guy.
01:59:56 I don't even remember who that is.
01:59:58 He was like the conspiracy theorist fat guy
02:00:01 with the noodle hair.
02:00:03 Oh, yeah.
02:00:04 Yeah, he's one of the Fry people, but yeah.
02:00:07 Yeah, there's conspiracy theorist guy.
02:00:09 There was the people who worked in the donut shop.
02:00:12 The girl was okay.
02:00:13 The boy was insufferable.
02:00:15 Lars and Sadie?
02:00:17 Yeah, that's them.
02:00:19 I mean, I would consider them a little bit more
02:00:21 than just like town-y side characters.
02:00:24 They kind of have their own little arc going on.
02:00:27 Yeah, they're the best ones.
02:00:29 But they're the best out of those, but I hate that fucking guy.
02:00:32 I hate that Lars guy.
02:00:35 I never saw the Res…
02:00:37 I know he gets like a spaceship later.
02:00:40 What?
02:00:41 Yeah, Lars and the Stars.
02:00:43 Oh.
02:00:44 He becomes like the captain of like a renegades
02:00:48 fucking gem spaceship.
02:00:50 Geez.
02:00:51 Yeah.
02:00:52 Oops, spoilers.
02:00:53 Whatever.
02:00:54 Yeah, some runaway gems from Homeworld.
02:00:58 Like he becomes their leader.
02:01:00 Wow.
02:01:01 And I don't think I ever saw how that resolves, actually.
02:01:06 Okay.
02:01:07 Okay, Steven.
02:01:08 Adventure Time started in 2010.
02:01:12 Gravity Falls started in 2012.
02:01:14 And Steamiverse started in 2013.
02:01:16 They are just like all like writing it after each other.
02:01:20 Yeah, okay.
02:01:23 And what do we have now?
02:01:26 What's exciting that's coming out now?
02:01:28 The Owl House and Nymphobia, I guess.
02:01:30 Are those still happening?
02:01:32 I think so.
02:01:33 Or did they end?
02:01:34 Okay.
02:01:35 I feel like, I don't know.
02:01:37 I feel like one of them ended.
02:01:40 But Owl House?
02:01:44 Maybe?
02:01:45 What's that one?
02:01:47 Wait a minute.
02:01:49 What's the one that has the little, I think she's like Hispanic girl.
02:01:54 She's like stone tosses, like banner?
02:01:59 I don't know.
02:02:02 Stone tosses banner?
02:02:04 Yeah.
02:02:05 Or maybe it was someone else.
02:02:07 Is it the Owl House girl?
02:02:09 Because there's a little girl in that.
02:02:12 I don't know.
02:02:13 This one.
02:02:14 Maybe?
02:02:15 Who's a gay?
02:02:16 I know she's a big gay.
02:02:18 Her.
02:02:19 I swear she was like stone tosses banner.
02:02:22 Or maybe someone else.
02:02:23 I don't know.
02:02:25 Was it to make fun of the gays by having a lesbian character as his banner?
02:02:31 I wish I knew.
02:02:32 I wish I knew why.
02:02:34 Maybe it wasn't him.
02:02:36 But it was someone like that.
02:02:38 Okay.
02:02:39 When are we getting a kid's cartoon about gay men?
02:02:43 Done with lesbians, I'm sick of them.
02:02:45 Where's the gay men?
02:02:46 Stone toss, get his own cartoon network for adventure.
02:02:50 True.
02:02:52 Yeah, gay men erasure.
02:02:54 In fact, all men erasure.
02:02:56 There were no men in Steven Universe.
02:02:59 There was a start.
02:03:01 There were only women.
02:03:03 It's a big fact that.
02:03:06 No, they emasculated him.
02:03:09 They made him.
02:03:11 They force feminized him.
02:03:13 Sorry, that's why he had long hair.
02:03:15 Oh yeah.
02:03:16 Yeah.
02:03:17 Yeah.
02:03:19 But.
02:03:21 His wife was taller than him.
02:03:23 So yeah, that's true.
02:03:27 What is, what did, what did fucking, his like, his like manager says to him that one time, like, fuck, what's the dad's name?
02:03:39 I have no idea.
02:03:42 I want to say.
02:03:45 It's something.
02:03:46 I mean, he was something universe.
02:03:48 I keep thinking it's, it's Steve.
02:03:51 I know.
02:03:52 The main character.
02:03:53 I keep wanting to say Steven Universe.
02:03:55 Because.
02:03:56 Steven's dad.
02:03:57 I've told you about this.
02:03:58 Greg, Greg Universe.
02:03:59 Okay.
02:04:00 Yeah.
02:04:01 I've told you about the stupid joke my friend has where he only refers to Steven Universe as Jared Universe for some reason.
02:04:05 Right.
02:04:06 No, maybe.
02:04:07 Me and my friend did that for a while.
02:04:09 So I literally just couldn't think of him as Steven Universe for ages.
02:04:12 It's like, it wouldn't look at him and say there's Jared from Jared Universe.
02:04:17 And then my brain went, his dad's called Steven.
02:04:21 Because he's called Jared.
02:04:23 His dad's called Steven.
02:04:24 So I had it like wrong.
02:04:26 That's the next, that's the next generation.
02:04:28 I don't understand.
02:04:31 But that, that his manager tells him like, like Greg, you know, why, why are you so focused?
02:04:38 Like you could have lots of little women, but instead your photo, you're too hyper focused on getting one big woman.
02:04:44 Base.
02:04:46 Absolutely base.
02:04:48 Maybe Steven Universe isn't so bad after all.
02:04:51 It's, it's got some, it's got, it's got some gems.
02:04:55 Yeah.
02:04:56 Get it.
02:04:57 Fucking get it.
02:05:00 True.
02:05:01 That's it.
02:05:02 End of the podcast.
02:05:03 End of the podcast.
02:05:04 It's time to go.
02:05:05 What do you, what do you think about voicemails?
02:05:07 Uh, no.
02:05:10 You know what?
02:05:12 I respect it.
02:05:15 If you, if you honestly, I wouldn't blame you if you want to leave and not do them and I'll just do them.
02:05:20 I think, I think we might be having dinner soon.
02:05:22 So it might make more sense to just not, me not hanging around because otherwise.
02:05:27 You know, you know what?
02:05:29 That's okay.
02:05:30 What, what would you, what do you even get out of them anyway?
02:05:33 I don't know.
02:05:34 Nothing.
02:05:35 Nothing.
02:05:36 The purpose of voicemails is to abuse me.
02:05:39 Yeah.
02:05:40 Okay.
02:05:41 I feel bad for abandoning you now, but.
02:05:45 No, I don't know.
02:05:46 It's honestly, I'll just, I'll just tear through them.
02:05:48 I'll just tear through them really fast.
02:05:50 Okay.
02:05:51 Everybody hate, the listeners hate the voicemails.
02:05:53 Nobody wins.
02:05:54 So.
02:05:55 Only the people who have submitted voicemails, like voicemails.
02:05:59 I think that's, I think that's true.
02:06:01 Yeah.
02:06:02 And then they go, oh my God, it's me.
02:06:07 My voice.
02:06:08 I hear it.
02:06:09 That's what I do.
02:06:10 That's, I only listened to the PCP episodes I was on.
02:06:13 The PCP.
02:06:14 And I go, oh my God, it was me.
02:06:16 The PCP is like a mirror for your voice.
02:06:19 If you put your voice on it, you can hear yourself instead of seeing yourself.
02:06:24 Wow.
02:06:25 Oblivion Fall is posting memes.
02:06:28 Oh no.
02:06:29 Is he?
02:06:30 He posted one meme.
02:06:32 He's right.
02:06:33 Yeah.
02:06:34 Something about animation.
02:06:35 Whatever.
02:06:36 Something about animation and how it's bad.
02:06:38 I studied animation and I decided I hated it.
02:06:42 Really?
02:06:43 Yeah.
02:06:44 I have a degree in animation.
02:06:45 Did you know that?
02:06:46 You do?
02:06:47 I didn't know that.
02:06:48 That's what I went to university for.
02:06:49 And I decided, yeah, I'm no good at this.
02:06:52 And it's too hard.
02:06:53 Yeah.
02:06:54 Still, still images are actually.
02:06:56 Just the way of the future, man.
02:06:58 Yeah.
02:06:59 I like animated 3D models, but I hate making them.
02:07:03 And I hate drawing animation as well.
02:07:07 I've never done anything with 3D models ever.
02:07:10 It's a, I don't know why I just got it.
02:07:13 I just sort of clicked with me and I was okay at it.
02:07:17 I did a little animation with Homer Simpson opening a box and then slamming it down and
02:07:21 he was pissed off.
02:07:22 And I was like, yeah, there we go.
02:07:24 One time, one time I applied for like a job.
02:07:28 I found out on Craigslist or something it was like an animator job for some furry porn
02:07:33 guy who I think just needed people to animate some like cartoon.
02:07:38 They were not public.
02:07:39 They were like for like, like subscriber only.
02:07:42 Like you had to like be subscribed to his like personal website.
02:07:46 And it was like, here, I'll give you, I'll give you flash puppets and like the application
02:07:51 when I submitted the application, they sent me a like a box.
02:07:56 They sent me a file of flash puppets and they were like, here, here's like a quick scene,
02:08:00 like a very brief little scene.
02:08:02 I take these flash puppets, animate the scene.
02:08:04 And I was like, okay, and I spent like a few days doing it like an idiot.
02:08:09 You know, I didn't know what I was doing.
02:08:11 So of course I was not accepted for the position and he was right not to let me do that, but
02:08:18 I did try it.
02:08:19 You could have made this furries personal NFTs for him.
02:08:24 Who probably who knows this was some this was some guy I'd never heard of sapphire
02:08:30 thing.
02:08:31 I don't know.
02:08:32 I don't even remember anywhere.
02:08:34 I can hear plates chinking and stuff downstairs.
02:08:37 I'm going to have to scram soon.
02:08:39 Well, that's okay.
02:08:41 It has been people trying to come in.
02:08:44 It's been lovely having you on.
02:08:47 Thanks for joining me.
02:08:48 Thanks for having me.
02:08:49 Thanks for filling time.
02:08:51 Yeah.
02:08:52 Okay.
02:08:53 Well, have a good snack.
02:08:55 Have a good meal.
02:08:56 I will do.
02:08:58 I will stop recording now.
02:09:01 Good.
02:09:03 These are good things.
02:09:06 All right.
02:09:08 Well, I guess it's just me.
02:09:10 I guess it's just me here on the pro crass natives podcast.
02:09:15 Let's rapid fire.
02:09:17 These fucking voicemails.
02:09:19 I pre downloaded them.
02:09:21 Which I guess was kind of a waste of time since I'm listening to them by myself.
02:09:27 When it's just when it's just PCP members, we can just be logged in to the speak pipe thing and just listen to them in.
02:09:34 In whatever in the in browser.
02:09:37 But it's okay.
02:09:38 I'll post them in the chat just for Eleazar's convenience so I don't have to make a zip file of them later.
02:09:46 All right.
02:09:47 First one is called that face when the world kind of agreed with the Nazis.
02:09:56 Okay.
02:09:57 Three, two, one, go.
02:09:58 So Ben and Gabe, we're talking about the whole like Anne Frank have white privilege thing where like they're speculating like how did the Nazis treat queer and black people.
02:10:09 And the thing is that it's wack because they did not treat queer black people very well as you might.
02:10:15 That is wack.
02:10:16 You know, in my conf Hitler literally blamed Jews for bringing black people to Germany to destroy the white race.
02:10:25 I see.
02:10:26 Oh, I see.
02:10:27 And also like the Nazis destroyed like some way ahead of its time research into a lot of queer stuff going on in Germany.
02:10:33 I heard that that was the first book burning.
02:10:35 It was like a trans clinic.
02:10:37 And one really talks about that.
02:10:39 You're not taught about that at school, presumably because the Allied powers didn't really want the bad look of agreeing with the Nazis on something.
02:10:47 So they just like shrunk it down to being only about Jews.
02:10:51 Yeah.
02:10:52 That sounds right.
02:10:54 That that squares with everything that I know.
02:10:58 And I mean, yeah, it is it is kind of a bummer, but I mean, you know, an entire country was like composed, maybe not majority, but like largely of people that like pretty much were down with this ideology.
02:11:14 And you know, people haven't changed that much.
02:11:16 So like, yeah, a lot of people, a lot of people felt that way.
02:11:20 And it's just a numerical fact that like a lot of people still do and they probably will for a long, long time, maybe forever.
02:11:29 So that's a great that's that's nice.
02:11:36 Next one is called I can't get no satisfaction.
02:11:41 And you know what?
02:11:42 I just realized I don't actually have to count down to these because no one else is going to have to time these is just me.
02:11:49 Okay, here we go.
02:11:52 Ah.
02:11:55 Yes.
02:11:58 Excellent.
02:12:15 Wait, really?
02:12:17 Who you think you are?
02:12:21 Okay, until you next time.
02:12:24 Sayonara.
02:12:48 But no, that's that's fair.
02:12:51 Okay, next one is called furthermore.
02:12:55 Okay, here we go.
02:13:18 Okay.
02:13:37 Okay.
02:13:48 Just got to do the best you can do.
02:13:57 Very, that's that's very big of you.
02:13:59 Very big of you samurai.
02:14:02 Okay, next one is called a song.
02:14:06 No, no, I won't count down.
02:14:08 Here we go.
02:14:09 What?
02:14:14 Wait, I got to listen to it again.
02:14:18 Turn my volume up.
02:14:25 I can't.
02:14:26 I'm sorry.
02:14:27 I can't make it out.
02:14:28 Good.
02:14:29 Good.
02:14:30 Good one.
02:14:31 Next.
02:14:35 Happy birthday, Ben.
02:14:37 Yeah, thanks very much.
02:14:39 Better safe than sorry, Ben.
02:14:41 Okay.
02:14:42 Here we go.
02:14:43 Three, two, one, go.
02:14:44 Shit.
02:14:45 Fuck me, Ben.
02:14:46 You've been going to the toilet a lot during these podcasts.
02:14:48 Has something changed?
02:14:49 Are you and well, maybe you should go doctor and get this checked up.
02:14:53 I pee a lot.
02:14:54 I pee a lot.
02:14:56 You know what?
02:14:57 I just I drink a lot of fluids to stay hydrated.
02:15:01 I've always I've always peed a lot.
02:15:04 I think so.
02:15:05 I drink a lot of fluids to stay hydrated.
02:15:07 And that's on purpose because I think it will help to prevent kidney problems.
02:15:13 I think I may have been insufficiently hydrating back when I had those kidney issues a couple
02:15:20 years ago.
02:15:21 So to avoid that, you know, if peeing a lot is the price I got to pay, well, well worth
02:15:27 it.
02:15:28 Next one is called life.
02:15:31 Okay.
02:15:32 Here we go.
02:15:34 You know, when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.
02:15:38 But life didn't give me any sugar.
02:15:40 So I go to life and I ask for some sugar.
02:15:42 And it says, yeah, it's in the mail.
02:15:44 Some sugar home.
02:15:46 And there it is my sugar.
02:15:47 But with an invoice, I go to life and I say, I can't afford this.
02:15:53 So anyway, I'm working for some sugar.
02:15:57 I didn't want for some lemons.
02:15:59 I didn't ask for life.
02:16:01 Life's a bitch.
02:16:04 Then why did you work for her?
02:16:07 You know, if you, if you, you know, if you don't, if you hate your, if you hate your
02:16:11 jobs, if you hate working for life so much, then why don't you just work for someone
02:16:15 else then?
02:16:16 Huh?
02:16:17 It's the free market.
02:16:19 Very drill.
02:16:23 Next one is called sucks that all the cool guests vanished and died in real life.
02:16:29 Yep.
02:16:30 MZ was the latest victim of that epidemic.
02:16:33 So, you know, so tragic.
02:16:36 Taken from us too early.
02:16:38 Three, two, one, go.
02:16:39 Fuck.
02:16:40 Where the fuck is Simzi and Cybert Shelling?
02:16:43 Gamer's Tavern?
02:16:45 What the fuck?
02:16:46 There was, they used to be on like all the, now what lies?
02:16:49 You know what?
02:16:52 You know what?
02:16:53 I have not asked.
02:16:55 I only, I only asked.
02:16:57 I mean, people, guests are welcome to join whenever they want, but I was just talking
02:17:04 to Simzi for unrelated reasons this morning and I mentioned that I was going to start
02:17:09 the podcast and he was welcome to be on.
02:17:11 So that's why he joined today.
02:17:14 But I just have not reached out to those other guys.
02:17:19 I did a while back, I think I did ask Cybert Shelling if he wanted to be on and he was
02:17:23 like, I can't do it this week.
02:17:25 I'll do it another time.
02:17:26 And I was like, okay.
02:17:27 And then I never asked again.
02:17:29 And I don't know.
02:17:30 I guess I just, I haven't been very proactive about reaching out to guests to be on the
02:17:37 podcast because, and this is going to sound bad.
02:17:40 And I, I'm sorry to say, I almost feel like I'm insulting you, the listener, by saying
02:17:45 this, but I have just not had a lot to talk about.
02:17:48 And I feel like I've been focused on working on some stuff and getting some stuff done.
02:17:54 And I kind of feel like maybe I'll have more to say to guests when I have more stuff that's
02:18:02 been recently put out and maybe some more stuff that's going on, like say the Kickstarter,
02:18:07 for example, or that video that I'm working on.
02:18:10 I don't know if that's irrational.
02:18:12 That might be irrational.
02:18:15 But that's how I'm approaching it.
02:18:17 I just haven't been asking guests very much.
02:18:22 But I mean, hey, if you want someone on, tell them to come on the podcast.
02:18:32 And maybe they will.
02:18:34 They're any, anyone, any, basically anyone who's previously been on is welcome to come
02:18:38 on anytime.
02:18:39 I'm just too stupid.
02:18:44 End of sentence.
02:18:45 Okay.
02:18:46 This one is called, well, it's an Imgur link.
02:18:53 So let's see what's going on there.
02:18:57 Okay.
02:18:58 Ben and Nate, the guy who shows up every fucking episode.
02:19:04 Oh, it's a, oh, because Nate used to be the one that showed up every, every fucking episode
02:19:09 and now it's me.
02:19:10 Well, I was, I was always, there was, you know, there was, you know,
02:19:15 there was a stretch there.
02:19:18 There was a stretch there where I was not on as much, which was, I don't know if, I think
02:19:26 I've mentioned this before.
02:19:28 That was because I had a terrible girlfriend who was like really weird about it and would
02:19:33 like get angry at me if I did things at certain times.
02:19:37 And PCP was something that she would basically hated whenever I did it.
02:19:45 For some reason.
02:19:48 So for a while there, I was not as much on the, other than that though, I think I was
02:19:52 one of the more, one of the more regular people.
02:19:58 Other than Nate, who was genuinely on like basically every episode for the first, or
02:20:04 almost every episode for the first, like probably 200 episodes or something.
02:20:07 Who else was more consistent than me?
02:20:09 I don't think anyone.
02:20:11 But I mean, anyway, point, point taken, I guess.
02:20:16 I mean, I guess you're just right.
02:20:18 I agree with the meme.
02:20:20 Next one is, oh boy, it's another, it's another Son of a Glitch.
02:20:27 Let's fucking go.
02:20:29 My favorite show on the internet, Son of a Glitch.
02:20:33 Welcome to my favorite show on the internet, Son of a Glitch.
02:20:38 Today's glitch is my bag of chips.
02:20:40 My bag of chips is green, but yesterday my bag of chips was orange.
02:20:45 Who is to say that tomorrow my bag of chips might be blue or pink?
02:20:51 This would be much better to animate for, in a midnight gospel style than fucking, oh,
02:21:17 my job is an undertaker.
02:21:19 And in the Civil War, they used to stuff people with straw when they died.
02:21:24 Isn't that weird?
02:21:26 Just, that's what I have to say about that.
02:21:32 Next one is, oh, the next one is called Multiversus is pretty good.
02:21:40 You can beat up Steven Universe.
02:21:46 Alright, posting that.
02:21:47 Here we go.
02:21:48 Three, two, one, go.
02:21:50 I realize I can send many messages at the same time instead of multiple messages.
02:21:56 Yeah, I mean, technically you can do that.
02:21:57 Make myself send something to make it funny.
02:22:01 So one, have you seen all the Lego movies?
02:22:05 Lego movie?
02:22:06 I saw the first one.
02:22:07 Lego movie.
02:22:08 Two, second part.
02:22:09 Batman.
02:22:10 No, just the first one.
02:22:12 It was good.
02:22:13 Lego Batman?
02:22:14 No.
02:22:15 Ninjago?
02:22:16 I think that's it.
02:22:17 They're all top tire animation things.
02:22:21 The first one looks really good.
02:22:23 Also, two, how do you draw?
02:22:25 I have a tablet thing, but it feels so weird comparing to actual paper and pencil.
02:22:33 What do I do?
02:22:35 Yeah.
02:22:36 I used to sketch in a sketchbook.
02:22:43 And then once I got my Wacom bamboo, I just used it all the time.
02:22:51 I just got myself accustomed to the bamboo by using it.
02:22:55 And then when I got a Cintiq, I didn't use the Cintiq for a long time because I was more accustomed to the bamboo.
02:23:04 So I would use the shitty bamboo instead, even though I had this much more sophisticated device.
02:23:09 But then at some point, I was like, I'm just going to start using it, just going to start practicing with it.
02:23:15 And pretty quickly, I was like, OK, this is actually way more convenient.
02:23:21 This is way more good.
02:23:25 So yeah, you just got to learn how to use it.
02:23:31 I mean, there's nothing wrong with drawing on paper.
02:23:33 It's a bit more inconvenient.
02:23:35 You've got to scan it and stuff to post it.
02:23:38 But just get a scanner if you like that sort of thing.
02:23:43 That's totally fine.
02:23:47 Next one is voice.
02:23:50 It's just called voicemail.
02:23:53 All right, here we go.
02:23:55 If you could instantly learn any language, what language would you choose?
02:24:01 I mean, I don't know, my answer is boring.
02:24:04 I'll probably just pick whichever one the most people speak, Cantonese.
02:24:11 I don't care.
02:24:15 I guess maybe Spanish.
02:24:17 I kind of, I speak a little Spanish.
02:24:20 I took it for years and years in high school.
02:24:23 So yeah, I'll probably just pick Cantonese.
02:24:26 More people speak that than Mandarin, right?
02:24:30 Yeah, whatever.
02:24:31 Just whatever lets me communicate with the most people.
02:24:35 I don't care.
02:24:37 Other than that, I have no particular proclivities.
02:24:43 Next one is called redash.
02:24:45 Sorry, that's such a boring answer.
02:24:47 I'm sorry, it's lame.
02:24:49 But that's me.
02:24:50 Next one is called redash.
02:24:55 Yo, Ben, you've been talking a lot about Mega Man and specifically like how many games there are in each sub-series of Mega Man and stuff like that.
02:25:02 And I'm surprised that in all of that, this one thing hasn't come up.
02:25:07 So I'm going to assume you don't know and probably break your heart live on air.
02:25:11 There was a Mega Man Legend 3 that was made almost to completion and then just never released for really dumb corporate reasons.
02:25:19 So I'll have fun with that.
02:25:21 PS, I thrash on your Ben Solo cast.
02:25:24 I thrash upon it.
02:25:26 Get punk perfect.
02:25:27 Pop pop.
02:25:28 Kind of true.
02:25:29 Park Boys is cringe.
02:25:30 Govate piss you.
02:25:31 Cop kiss her.
02:25:32 Kind of.
02:25:33 It is at this point a solo cast.
02:25:34 No, why would you think that I don't know that?
02:25:38 No, I am aware.
02:25:40 I didn't know it because I never played the Legends games before.
02:25:44 But now I played the first one and I was looking into the second one.
02:25:48 And yes, I am aware that there was a 3 that was cancelled way later.
02:25:56 And I was not sure why it was cancelled.
02:25:59 I assumed it was bullshit and apparently indeed it is.
02:26:03 And that's...
02:26:05 Yeah.
02:26:09 Seems terrible.
02:26:10 It seems like really awful and tragic and senseless.
02:26:19 But yes, I am aware and it's a bummer.
02:26:22 I will play 2 and then I will regret and then I will probably be sad that I don't have a
02:26:29 third one to play.
02:26:31 Maybe I'll do that this week if I get the chance.
02:26:36 Good voicemail.
02:26:37 The next one is called a very demanding voicemailer.
02:26:42 Where did I put that?
02:26:43 Here we go.
02:26:45 Here we go.
02:26:46 Okay.
02:26:47 3, 2, 1, go.
