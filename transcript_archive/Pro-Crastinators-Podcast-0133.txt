00:00:00 Alright guys, I'm just gonna level you through right now on this episode of The Pro Crastinators
00:00:26 Podcast. Real fucking tuck, got shit on by a bird yesterday. This isn't a joke, I actually
00:00:31 got shit on by a bird yesterday. And that's the tone we're gonna start for this episode
00:00:35 of the PCP. Are you talking about, are you talking about, are you talking about a bird?
00:00:38 Uh, yeah, cause there was, you know, I'm a fifties guy and these fucking birds, these
00:00:42 fucking dames are shitin' on me. Tell me I got a small cock and a fat head. I don't,
00:00:46 I don't appreciate this making mockery effect that I had literal animal feces on me yesterday.
00:00:52 Tom, have you ever gotten shit by a bird? Uh, uh, yeah, uh, no. My car gets shit on
00:00:56 by birds all the time, cause I have to park it right under the, the, the, the, the electric
00:01:02 wire thing, the fucking high tension wire shit that's right going by the house. So it's
00:01:06 just constantly covered in bird shit and I can't, can't compete. It's too much. I'm
00:01:11 buried on shit. Mage, I don't know if they even have birds, let alone shit in Lithuania.
00:01:15 Have you even know what those two things are? Of course we have pigeons. No, no, no, no,
00:01:21 they were all wiped out in the war. Yeah. I mean, we're talking about real birds. Like
00:01:27 if any bird were to survive any wars, I feel pigeons would be the ones. That's true. That's
00:01:33 why you wiped them out intentionally. You couldn't have them surviving. I had, I had
00:01:39 almost been shot on by a pigeon almost. I thankfully dodged it, but like without even
00:01:45 meaning to. I have been literally shot on by a bird in the past. It has happened to me
00:01:50 and I know the trauma. I understand this pain. Well, okay. I was actually, yeah, it was actually
00:01:54 a very, like a learning experience for me. It was more informative than any trip to the
00:01:58 museum I've ever taken because I learned at least in my, I know that both hippo and I
00:02:04 guess you need to have both been shot by a bird. What's the cartoon? I imagine from watching
00:02:09 cartoons, it would be almost sort of like a, like a, like a white sauce, Italian like cheese
00:02:14 sort of like splattering on me. It would be sort of like a chunky white sort of black,
00:02:20 like splattering of paint ask material. But for me, um, it was like, it was like a, it
00:02:27 was an object. Like I, I, I, something dropped in my head and it kind of bounced off and
00:02:31 I looked down and I thought, Oh, look, what a weird looking berry. And then I looked up
00:02:35 to see what kind of tree was under and then I realized I just saw a pigeon ass and I was
00:02:38 like, wait a second. And then I touched that in my head and there was like an already dry
00:02:44 like white substance, like a white, like, like, I guess I would describe like a thin
00:02:48 layer of almost felt like it was like a, a white off, you know, it almost felt like it
00:02:53 was like a dry white off. Oh, that's my experience. Is this all the way is the way it is? Or is
00:02:59 there the splatter? I think it was just a sick bird. I think it was just a sick bird. I don't
00:03:05 know. Like that does not sound like normal. I remembered being a little more gloopy, I guess.
00:03:11 I don't know. If you look on, if you look at the, I got, I got a bunch of bird shit on my car
00:03:15 at the moment. It's like, it's black and white shit. It's a little bit smeared. So it's, it was
00:03:20 like mostly hard, but with goop enough to stick it to the fucking side of the car, I guess. That's
00:03:25 what I remember being like, more or less, more liquidy. Yeah. I was doing fucking 50 quick
00:03:31 catches in a row. I was getting shiny cinequilla. I got a 100% cinequilla and I was riding high.
00:03:36 I was euphoric in that moment. Nothing could defeat me. Nothing could even pierce my skin,
00:03:42 let alone my bone. And then this bird, this fucking sick ass bird came along and he shit on me.
00:03:48 He shit all over me. I didn't check any of the stats in my cinequilla, but I did catch four
00:03:53 shinies, which I will be giving away to Gib Mage and Michelle because that's what I do. And then
00:04:00 keeping the best one for myself, of course. Oh, it's good. It was good. I, I'm so ready
00:04:06 for Radcon 4 so I can get there before Hippo so I can give you all Mr. Mimes for a cheaper price.
00:04:12 So he'll be coming out of the satisfaction of giving you guys a Mr. Mime. That poor man. Poor bastard.
00:04:20 So what else is going on people? Who's got, who's got things to bring to the table? I've got one.
00:04:24 I've got one. Well, I should lead by example. I think I will. Thanks. So, so where was, oh yeah,
00:04:32 so here's what I want to talk about. So I recently put out a new video on the channel Best Guy Ever.
00:04:37 Maybe you've heard of it. And it was my, it was my technically fourth, really the third reel
00:04:42 of my like smash videos. And this one was, this one was Simon Belmont called Sign of the Cross.
00:04:49 And as I was making it for over a month, working on it basically every day for several
00:04:54 hours, probably put 100 hours into that video. Because I had to do research. I had to play some
00:05:01 of the games. I had to learn things and grow as a human being in order to be ready to produce
00:05:05 this thing for the world. Also, it was just way longer than the others. I was just thinking about
00:05:13 the concept of cost benefit analysis for how much time I've put in. So it's already the least
00:05:21 popular of my smash videos, including the Isabel one, which was a literal shitpost meme, not real
00:05:29 video. I feel like your entire career could be described as meditations on cost benefit analysis.
00:05:35 That's really the running theme from the creation of you as a baby. That's correct. That's correct.
00:05:42 And I, here's what I've noticed. This happened to we Agua. It happened to my like bigger editing
00:05:48 videos, though those started off like the current ones were already huge projects. And now with the
00:05:52 Ridley videos, like the smash confirmed is what I'm calling them. Like the Ridley one was the
00:05:58 shortest. Then there was, then the K-roll one was bigger than the Isabel one. I mean, it was
00:06:03 different, but it was the longest, I guess. That one doesn't count, I guess. And now this one's
00:06:06 over 10 minutes long, and I can't monetize it. And the fucking people who did monetize it,
00:06:11 because I'm using a copyrighted song, put an ad in the middle of the video that interrupts the flow
00:06:16 of the fucking video. It's a musical video. Please don't do that. But they did. So that's
00:06:22 unfortunate. But it's, everything I'm doing as I work forward, I end up committing more time to
00:06:30 individual things. And I'm getting, I wouldn't say less return on it, but there's kind of diminishing
00:06:36 returns for more effort. And I'm feeling that in a big way. This is your Cardinalism. This is your
00:06:42 Cardinalism that you continually do. Is that you keep, you keep getting away from the plot of
00:06:49 YouTube. Like you got to, you got, the whole point of doing Viagra was to escape this, this
00:06:55 low effort content that constantly claims you. And you keep crawling back to it. You keep going
00:07:00 back and like, no, I have to make these masterpiece videos. And I understand the, the inner artists
00:07:06 that you wanted to create something beautiful and God tier and like the greatest thing of all time.
00:07:12 I get that like the inner Starfleet and you wants to do this. However, we don't live in Starfleet.
00:07:17 We live in a cold, capitalistic, evil society where none of that shit matters and you're fucking
00:07:23 yourself over and it's terrible. I'm over here watching your, your, your, your fall from grace
00:07:29 and it pains me to no end. It's not a fall from grace guy. No, it is. You had good momentum going.
00:07:36 Things were great. You had these weekly videos. People loved it. You shot yourself in the foot.
00:07:41 I understand, but you need to make a product. But you know what it really is? This is the main
00:07:47 problem. It's that, and what you said is true, Tom, but I was thinking about it and I'd phrase it
00:07:51 like this. It's that once I had the idea to make the Simon video and I knew what song, you know,
00:07:57 Sign of the Cross, Iron Maiden, it's a great song and whatever just seemed like the perfect fit.
00:08:02 Once I knew I was going to do that and I had committed myself mentally, the idea of changing
00:08:08 or like modifying or scaling down the vision I had in my head was, was, there was, I like,
00:08:15 rejected physically. I can't do that because that's, that's like ruining something that exists in my
00:08:21 head and to not make it real. I get that. Nate, Nate, you had struck. I get that hardcore.
00:08:26 But, but here's what I say. Nate, you had struck.
00:08:30 God much, God much, yeah. You had struck such fucking hard, unbelievable gold with the fact
00:08:36 that your fans literally enjoyed Weagua. There's so many YouTube creators who are like, all right,
00:08:43 I'm going to switch away from the videos I actually like to make weekly garbage that no one actually
00:08:46 cares about. And then they lose other subscribers and everyone thinks that they're a fucking hack
00:08:50 fraud. But your Weagua videos, everyone fucking claims for it. Everyone adores Weagua. Everyone
00:08:56 loves the logo because it's the only reason why anyone would watch that show. They love the logo.
00:09:00 They want the t-shirts, of course. That's true. Everyone loves it. And then you're like, actually,
00:09:05 you know what, weekly content, it's not all it's cracked up to be. I'm going to go back to
00:09:08 releasing every six months, every blue moon. Listen, just do some various smoke signals and maybe
00:09:17 I'll come to the scene and make a video or two. Yeah, okay. I think there's a sweet spot to hit.
00:09:22 One is that, and I think Weagua, sorry, Mia Maffova did do this. There was enough branding
00:09:28 with Mia Maffova that people were excited for the next one because you hear the little jingle
00:09:33 every time I say Mia Maffova. There's the cool intro song. And that, I think, appealed to people.
00:09:38 Yeah, that's one of the tellers of Primal Brand. And then also the content, I think, was varied
00:09:40 enough. Yeah. And then the other thing is, I think it was different enough day to day that that kept
00:09:46 things fresh for people. So I don't know. I think a sweet spot like that is a good balance.
00:09:52 Here's what confuses me to no end. If you're spending... By the way, guys, I didn't want to
00:09:56 just talk about me. So I'm happy to hear a point. I just, it wasn't my point to just be like...
00:10:00 But this is what I've not understood, right? You said you, how long did this Simon video take you?
00:10:06 A month to do, you said? Over a month. Probably a month and a half. Here's my question. If it's
00:10:10 going to take you over a month to get this video done, why not say instead of a month, it's going
00:10:16 to take me five weeks? And I'll spend a couple hours of that time making a Weagua instead. And
00:10:22 then you shit out a Weagua. In the meantime, nobody can... People like them, so you're doing both.
00:10:28 If these long projects are going to take forever, what's another week if you spend a week's worth
00:10:32 of time making the weekly content on like the Thursday and Friday? That makes sense, Tom.
00:10:38 Reasonable question. The thing is a Weagua actually takes me a full week or more to get done. Then
00:10:44 you're even doing Weagua wrong. Stop it. I agree. I am doing it wrong because Weagua also had like
00:10:51 feature creep where it just got longer and longer and I added more. I don't know why I did that.
00:10:54 Nobody cares. I don't want it to be that way. No one needed all the giant sections that was not
00:11:02 necessary. Have I told you about my dream video site that I want to exist? Maybe, but tell us again.
00:11:08 My dream video uploading site would be a site where anybody can upload anything they want,
00:11:16 but your account can only upload one video a week. So it forces you to not waste your slot.
00:11:23 Do something good every week. You instantly cut out 99% of YouTube's bullshit. You're not going
00:11:30 to waste your one slot on a reaction vlog to something that's retarded. I'm going to waste
00:11:35 my week on a drama thing that happened because you're either going to waste your slot for your
00:11:40 actual content that week and if you wait until next week to respond to it, it's already water
00:11:44 under the bridge. It goes back to television. The one good thing about television is that things
00:11:50 were paced and there was meaty content every week because you'd have your one one hour episode
00:11:56 a week and that's what I want. I want a website like that where everybody is just like... It really
00:12:00 is. It's all about the platform for sure. Oh, Meij, do you want to comment? Tell me,
00:12:05 you talked about this before at some point, right? I don't know if it was on the show or just when
00:12:10 we were in a call, like in a meeting or something. I remember tweeting about it, but this is something
00:12:15 that when I'm smart, I will make and it will exist. I am rooting for you, Tom. Sounds like a good idea.
00:12:23 It's a cool idea because, yeah, I don't know. A lot of people might have a reaction to that. We're
00:12:27 like, eh, why do you want to, I don't know, like curtail the freedom of people to just upload anything?
00:12:32 And it's like, well, okay, you've got YouTube for that. And maybe I'm speaking to literally nobody
00:12:36 right now, but anybody who might have that reaction. I mean, my thought process behind that would be,
00:12:40 it's kind of like Vine. Vine, well, why can't I upload longer in six seconds? Because that's the
00:12:44 culture of Vine. The culture of this site would be like, you focus on making a good, depth piece
00:12:50 of content and you get one shot to do it a week. Yeah. And maybe there could be something like,
00:12:56 you know what's a shame? It's a shame that YouTube got rid of the ranking out of five stars or
00:13:01 whatever and put the thumbs up and thumbs down. Maybe you could do something where the videos
00:13:05 that are promoted are based, like you put back the zero out or one to five stars or whatever,
00:13:11 and then like the highest, you know, ranked videos. But then here's the thing, and this is
00:13:15 maybe slightly controversial, but it's that people don't know what's actually good and they'll upvote
00:13:20 like, you know, meme posts or like, you know, conserve a cuck, blown the fuck out or libtard
00:13:26 destroyed. And it's like, this is fine and all. But like then, then just the tribes are the ones
00:13:32 who dictate as opposed to some like mythical idea of actually the highest quality content. I mean,
00:13:38 I don't know. I'm just, is there, how can we fight this? You can also have like a, I don't know,
00:13:43 like staff picks or something. So something you think is good. Like, yeah. And I'm the only staff
00:13:49 member. So I get to decide what's good. All right. Bestsiteever.com. It's happening. Hey, there you
00:13:55 go. That's good. You could bring back blams from Newgrounds so you could delete shit that is bad.
00:14:01 What's a blam? A blam is, forgive me if I'm wrong, DeVue. But to my understanding, a blam is when
00:14:07 a work on Newgrounds gets enough, I think a zero star or one star radians, then it is literally
00:14:13 deleted from the website because it is shit. Jesus Christ. That's hardcore. That seems heavily
00:14:20 abusable. But cool. Now you have a good community. It's all about having a community that isn't full
00:14:27 of shit. But you know, with today's, today's, I don't know, fucking mob mentality shit. That is
00:14:32 true. That's just, I mean, I mean, that's just the community of the world is like that. No,
00:14:37 all right, I guess I shouldn't be in the world. I can only speak for America. But that's how,
00:14:40 that's how it is when you walk outside. It's not just a left to right thing. It's everything's
00:14:43 black and white. There's no fucking granular scale for literally any piece of, of aspect of society.
00:14:51 Life itself is thumbs up for thumbs down. That's what we've learned. Yeah. You know what I think it
00:14:56 is. You know, I think the cause is I think, so basically, I guess I think that like, so whatever,
00:15:02 far left people and far right people and everybody in between have always existed. And those people
00:15:06 have different, like, what's the word? They have, they have different foundational principles, whereas
00:15:13 like a lot of like more libertarian right wing people value freedom and stuff as like the highest
00:15:18 virtue. And then people on the left value like protection and safety, neither of which is wrong,
00:15:22 but is a big difference. And because they have those different values, like they come to very
00:15:26 different conclusions. Sorry, say again, liberals, the ones for freedom and the other ones for
00:15:34 the definition of liberal. Yes, was originally about freedom. But I should say left wing,
00:15:39 I guess, as opposed to liberal. But okay, that aside, the value judge difference is all I'm
00:15:43 saying. And I just think that because of social media, like, like in the old days, like you'd
00:15:48 have in the same town, like the guy who runs the coffee shop, let's say he's the biggest right
00:15:52 wing MAGA motherfucker who ever existed. And then like his clientele, who live on the other side
00:15:57 of the town, but come to him for his great coffee, are like, I don't know, hardcore, lib, cuck, you
00:16:04 know, I don't know, anarchy, guys inside, but the thing is, they never would have the breeze.
00:16:10 Well, the thing, well, hang on, the thing, it's just that I think now that like, we have Twitter,
00:16:15 now those people might follow each other. And maybe that coffee shop owner is going to tweet
00:16:19 how much he loves Donald Trump's thick cock. And the, the, you know, patron will see that and be
00:16:24 like, Oh, now I know this person has wrong think, and I can hate them and do that. And I just think
00:16:29 that like our access to each other's thoughts via social media has made the world a very hostile
00:16:34 place where like these ideas are able to like recognize each other as enemies and clash like
00:16:40 a lot. For sure. That's definitely part of it. But I mean, I mean, people have always talked about
00:16:44 their feelings before. I'm sure if they, if those more to the forefront is all, you know,
00:16:49 what else it is, in person, I think people are way more charitable to each other than like the
00:16:55 straw man we can make of each other online. What I was saying, guys, it's also because of the
00:17:02 internet, we gain the ability to access people with the same mindset as we are. So the people that
00:17:08 used to be, you know, quite literally the minority, let's say, or with the very far leaning ideas,
00:17:14 they're able to find people much like them and group up and do bigger things.
00:17:18 Yeah. So you're less exposed to different ideas. It's, you know, we're just describing what is it
00:17:23 like forming tribes, basically, that's oldest time. It's what happens. Politics is a real world
00:17:31 manifestation of basically a clash of philosophies. And like, like I said, for like personal values.
00:17:37 So which is why I'd always rather say, you know, like my whatever, man, I'm no fucking saint. I
00:17:43 fuck this shit up. I say political stuff to everybody does. But it would be best I know of
00:17:47 myself to just only argue like, hey, guys, my chief virtues are number one is freedom. Number two is
00:17:55 safety and like protection. And then, you know, respect after that, etc. What are your values,
00:18:01 fellow Americans, fellow human beings? And if someone is a different rank, we can be like, oh,
00:18:05 okay, why do you think we disagree on that friend? Let you know, we all care about people. Let's
00:18:09 have a civil debate about this or something. But no, it's like fuck Donald Trump, fuck Hillary,
00:18:15 which is just I think a lot of it is the fact that when you have these philosophies tied into
00:18:20 a campaign, which you can win slash lose, it turns into like a game that you have to like,
00:18:27 you have to convince other people to vote for your candidate. So they are like, you know,
00:18:33 it's very firmly against it. You're like, well, you're going to make me lose in this video game.
00:18:36 What the fuck, dude? That's true. Politics is I mean, it's just any any candidate ever has
00:18:45 massive flaws, single transportable vote. Yeah, let's get single transferable vote at the very
00:18:51 least we need that shit Bernie to be present right now, if that had happened, which I don't even know
00:18:55 if I'd want, but it's probably better than what we have now. Yeah. Yeah, it's because like, I don't
00:19:01 know. As soon as you make politics about choosing a real world person to whatever, you know, like
00:19:08 everyone on the left will find everything wrong with everyone on the right and that candidate,
00:19:11 which is understandable. They can do that. The you know, people on the other side will do the
00:19:15 exact same thing about their candidate because we're human beings. Oh, we just need a perfect
00:19:20 AI with no moral failings to manage this shit or something. Civil system now, civil system 2020.
00:19:27 Yeah, yeah, let's elect. Could we could probably literally elect an AI as president who says it's
00:19:32 not a person? I say it is. I think a computer would literally do a better job if it's like
00:19:37 perfectly logical. It's just that people eventually get tired of perfect logic and they want they
00:19:42 want some good old, you know, anger, emotion, human is logical. We're all emotional retarded
00:19:48 creatures. And it's true. It's true. We're just playing at intelligence, but we don't really
00:19:53 think a lot of it isn't like logic, you know, if you were to listen to like a like a like a
00:19:59 intelligent Democrat or Republican or you know, liberal conservative, explain their position.
00:20:04 It's obviously to a large extent logical because these people aren't intentionally doing retarded
00:20:09 things. So it's not just a method of like, okay, this person is being illogical. They want this
00:20:15 or they want that. It's just a difference of what they value and can what you value?
00:20:19 Because what does a computer decide when you say it's, you know, whatever freedom versus
00:20:25 protection? Like there is no objective answer as to which is the priority value. And so
00:20:30 that's why there will always be a debate because there will be a disagreement there. And you can
00:20:34 tell a computer, which to say is more important, but the other people will still disagree and
00:20:39 consider it injustice probably. So there's no solution. So we're all wasting our time. It's
00:20:44 never going to be fixed. All we can do is invent Star Trek technology so we can just bypass all
00:20:50 these questions and say, look, you'll never die. You're free to do whatever the fuck you want.
00:20:54 You've got infinite food. Shut the fuck up and take care of yourself. You're fine. And everyone
00:20:59 can go in their little caves. And you know, that that'll be that. That's like a goblin,
00:21:05 which I was watching today. So man, guys, bird shit, sir gets on everything, don't it?
00:21:10 It sure does, Brandon. It sure does. I heard that somewhere in some cultures or whatever,
00:21:15 it's considered good luck to be shot on by a bird. Well, those cultures are stupid.
00:21:22 Well, that's surprising. I just got back from Boston. I was there for, I think, the fourth,
00:21:28 fifth time. Anyway, I live there now, not with my physical body, but with my spirit, with my mind.
00:21:35 Right now, as I talk to you physically, using my vessel of meat, I'm spiritually plain tennis
00:21:43 with with upstart aristocrats in neighboring suburban white folk towns surrounding the West
00:21:50 East area. You came back from Boston. It's getting pretty chilly out in the Northeast
00:21:56 these days. How do you how do you like the weather change as opposed to sunny California?
00:22:01 I must have talked about this somewhere because this is a firm belief I have.
00:22:07 Fuck California's weather. I hate it. I hate the sun. I hate the heat. I hate the humidity.
00:22:16 I hate all of that. Granted, Massachusetts actually gets pretty hot during the summer
00:22:21 and pretty humid, but the winter. Oh my God. When I get to fucking put on my iPod, the Scott
00:22:27 pilgrim, the game soundtrack, I get to put on another winter, the first track, and I get to run
00:22:33 down the fucking streets as it's snowing. It's fucking negative to outside. Maybe it's even
00:22:37 raining. Everyone looks pissed off and upset. I've just got the biggest grin on my face walking
00:22:42 around feeling so at home because I'm so fucking fat that I would overheat in California. But now
00:22:47 I can subsist with my fat disgusting bulbous body here in Massachusetts, and it doesn't even affect
00:22:53 me whatsoever. It's magnificent. It's beautiful. It's the only way I want to live my life. I literally
00:22:58 enjoy overcast weather. I hate the sun. I want everything to be dreary and cloudy all the time
00:23:05 because that's fucking, first of all, that's comfy. Second of all, that's like happiness from
00:23:10 adversity. Art from adversity. Sure, maybe on the surface it's sad, but you can make it happy if
00:23:16 you do good things, stuff like that. Is there some study that seeing seasons change increases
00:23:22 happiness or something? I thought there was something like that. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know.
00:23:25 That doesn't sound true. It gives you a marker for how the years judge, because when I'm in here
00:23:30 in San Diego, fucking, I look outside and every single day it's fucking, oh, there's no rain. It's
00:23:34 just clear, perfect, cloudy, no cloud skies, all the sun's out. Boring. It's just like that.
00:23:41 Just another day of fires approaching from the distance, burning up the landscape.
00:23:47 Every single day I can see the immigrant convoy getting closer and closer.
00:23:53 Yeah, it's a fucking nightmare. It sucks, and I hate it. I don't even like it.
00:23:58 I feel you. Yeah, the weather is best in Boston. I'm excited to see what the weather's like in
00:24:04 London, because if it's like how everyone describes, then I'll like it even more. Yeah,
00:24:09 cloudy. Cloudy. Chance of meatballs. Oh man, that sounds ideal. I love that movie. I love
00:24:15 Penguins and Managascar 5. Cloudy with the Chance of Meatballs.
00:24:19 I know the book. I like the book, you know. Nate, you grew up in Massachusetts, right?
00:24:25 Sure did, fan. How do you, like, what is, you live in Chicago? I live in Cincinnati now,
00:24:32 Cincinnati, Ohio. Oh, that's like the same though, isn't it? Ohio is East Coast. It's pretty similar.
00:24:36 Ohio is East Coast. It's the same. Everything passed. Okay, okay, here's my way you distribute
00:24:42 the United States. We're in the same time zone, not too far. Everything west of Denver is the
00:24:46 West Coast, and everything east of Denver is East Coast. Okay, that makes sense. That's a lot of
00:24:51 East Coast. Well, you know, they deserve it. They deserve it. They burned it. They put in their
00:25:00 time. They put in their hours. I'm so excited for PCPHQ. I'm excited for it with all my heart.
00:25:06 Okay, okay, it will literally be real soon. Okay, you got Tom, Digi, and Ben there. I'm going to
00:25:12 move there in the next year or two maximum. And Nate, I don't know what your deal is, but you
00:25:20 and Hippo, after I'm there, are going to be the only two people who would realistically even move
00:25:24 to PCPHQ in any time. So that's like what? That's like, you got me, like four people.
00:25:31 I know I've said this a lot. I know I've said this a lot, but it really, like, my school debts
00:25:38 paid. My income, good. My YouTube, you know, better than ever. And if I was making a WEAG,
00:25:44 it was regularly, which I will be doing, you know, be even better, be even better. So it's
00:25:49 looking good. I guess that's my point. It's looking good. I have no idea about Hippo. Hippo might
00:25:54 never come, which he might never come. It's true. I mean, I mean, I would, I mean,
00:25:59 understand it from his perspective. I wouldn't probably move either.
00:26:02 Like if we were all, if we were all in Radcon, all I'm saying is if we're all there already,
00:26:07 we sure need to use a lot less money to get just one guy there as opposed to everybody else. So
00:26:13 that seriously decreases cost of flying a dude out. So, you know, that's a plus.
00:26:17 All right. Think about next Radcon because I was thinking about, I had on the last day
00:26:21 before I left for Boston, I was talking about it in chat for a while. I was starting playing
00:26:23 for next Radcon. I was thinking, Tom, you took an even though you were in Massachusetts, you took
00:26:28 like an Uber and that was like what, like a fucking billion dollars. It was like a $9 Uber,
00:26:31 some shit, right? Something like that. Something in that ballpark. Yeah.
00:26:36 Did you have to drive that? I don't know if you pay him back for gas, but then Ben had to fly out,
00:26:40 I think. I had to fly out and then Nate had to fly out, Hippo had to fly out and Jesse had to
00:26:45 fly out. But if I'm already in Boston, I mean, Tom was already in an area where he wouldn't need
00:26:51 to do a like a fucking $90 Uber because you have your own car. I have a car now, so wouldn't even
00:26:55 have to do that at all. Digi's there and Ben's there. So that's like what, like three or four
00:27:00 fucking like like airplane tickets just literally gone? That, yep, that's right. So now we have to
00:27:06 worry about is getting the house and you Nate and then Hippo and maybe even you Nate, I don't know,
00:27:10 in the foreseeable future, maybe even you won't be a cost. So where are we going to pay for it?
00:27:14 It will probably be the house and Hippo. Yeah. And I mean, maybe major, she's available,
00:27:20 who wants to come too. But yeah, yeah. I mean, anyone, yeah, anyone who wants to obviously,
00:27:24 you know, and Si, flying Si out, it's going to be the headline. Love you, Si. Rest in peace.
00:27:32 Yeah. So man, we gotta do that. We gotta get on that. You're right. We can do it for like a back
00:27:39 scratch and maybe a song. Hey, here's a challenge for all you viewers at home. Give us your favorite
00:27:46 name, money. Hell's your favorite name for Radcon four. I like personally, my choice is R for Dekon,
00:27:54 you know, that one. I sure like that one. I don't know what that means. What do you like friends?
00:27:58 Well, it's Radcon just with a four instead of the A. Oh, right. That's what I'm saying. My idea is
00:28:05 that I want everybody to get to like be in Boston at that point. And then we can just call it Radcon
00:28:11 forever because everyone will already be there and they'll never. Oh, that's yeah, I forgot about
00:28:14 that one. Okay, okay. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Oh, maybe we could do a thing where
00:28:19 it's spelled Radcon four horizontally with the four as the A. And then from that vertically,
00:28:25 you've got four EVA or whatever, whatever. This logo is going to be a real pain to
00:28:31 fucking make when I do it, guys. That's true. That's true. Tom, do you remember?
00:28:39 Oh, no, absolutely. No, I wouldn't want to discuss it.
00:28:42 To get people's hopes up. It's just a twinkle in our eye right now.
00:28:47 A pretty large twinkle. It's pretty blinding right now. I can only see like half my computing
00:28:50 monitor because of this fucking twinkle. Yeah, that's true. Tom, do you remember that fucking,
00:28:58 looking back on it like bizarre, like fucking like a 900 hour conversation you, me, and Digi, and Ben
00:29:04 had while Ben was drunk and mining in the swore about about how we're going to fucking start
00:29:12 hanging out together more about how we're going to we're going to be fucking gods, how we're going
00:29:18 to make web 3.0 shit. And you remember how that we did that? And then immediately what I said would
00:29:24 happen because this is the way it always happens is that that chassis laid fallow forever since then.
00:29:30 Yeah, you need a real spark, you know, to keep something like that going.
00:29:34 Vague ideas about we're going to change the game, you guys are all well and good.
00:29:38 But you need a real product. What you don't understand is that Ben,
00:29:45 too drunk, Digi, too Digi, but me and you, we're going to make this real.
00:29:52 Yeah, I think you and me are the only people who are actually like, I guess taking it up on that
00:29:57 offer, taking it up on that conversation. I mean, you and me are going to literally be
00:30:00 recording a podcast. I mean, next week was last week. So this week is the week we're going to record
00:30:06 that. We're going to do that. We also we also have our that we have the basis for it. We're going
00:30:12 to do that alone. Also, I don't want to say anything about that. So cut that from the podcast.
00:30:17 No, no, no, no. I'll just put a big point about this. How much of this is monetizable,
00:30:23 either short term or long term is my question. Neither, but I don't need to.
00:30:28 None. Okay. Well, it depends. How much time are you prepared to invest in any of this if it's not
00:30:33 going to make any money? Oh, well, okay, okay, okay. It might be monetizable in a roundabout way.
00:30:39 One of the things we're going to be doing is a coding podcast. And I'm going to be coding for
00:30:44 endless war. So maybe people liking endless war more will make them want to buy more shirts.
00:30:48 So maybe in that way, there's something to that. And I don't want to talk about the other things.
00:30:53 So I mean, but there's no money there. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, whatever. By the way,
00:30:57 I still think you guys should make a, well, actually, no, I won't even mention it. Never mind.
00:31:00 Why? Well, I was going to say, I do think a Patreon should exist for endless war specifically,
00:31:07 because I think it deserves money. I think people would happily give it. But I know there's like
00:31:11 complications that like there's money to go around who gets what, whatever.
00:31:16 Yeah. I don't know. Maybe, maybe. There's a lot, there's a lot up in the air about endless war
00:31:23 right now. There's a lot up in the air, but RFCK in general, not in like, that sounds,
00:31:28 that sounds doom and gloom. I mean that in like, it like it's ending way. I just mean that as in
00:31:32 like, we're not sure what we want to do. Yeah. Big things. Oh man, got something to bring to
00:31:38 the fucking table. What else is going on? I can keep talking forever. I can just, I can just carry
00:31:45 this fucking episode. Okay, so like, I'm like, I'm like two, three, maybe four years late to the
00:31:52 trend, but I finally got Nekoatsume. Really? Yes. What is that? Oh, it was a really big mobile game.
00:32:00 Yeah. It's so cute. I love it. And like, I showed a screenshot from it. It's a cat in a cardboard
00:32:06 car and it's all squished up and it's adorable and I love it. Oh my god. The gameplay of Nekoatsume,
00:32:12 from what I remember, is that you, you exist in a virtual house and you're in your, in your
00:32:17 virtual life and you can fill up like, you know, you can set out some food for cats and just randomly,
00:32:21 whenever you check your phone, like, like you basically just put out the food, then like,
00:32:24 close your phone and come back in like an hour or two and there'll be some cats there and all the
00:32:28 cats have their own unique personalities and stuff like that and you just want to fill out your,
00:32:32 your cat pokedex. Basically. Well, that's cool. I cannot relate to this because it's not MLG
00:32:39 shit or I can't hit the leaderboard. You can't land those curveball excellent throws.
00:32:46 Yeah, that's right. That's right. But, but, but also started another mobile game that's called
00:32:53 the battle cats, which is where you take over the world with cats. So I think like,
00:32:57 Nekoatsume is the prequel to where you, where you like, befriend the cat. You assemble your army.
00:33:04 Yeah. And you assemble the army and then like, with battle cats is where you take over the world
00:33:08 with the part of the cat. There's a lot of continuity. You know, there's a lot of entries
00:33:13 going on. Yes. Well, that's dope, dog. I hope you have a lot of fun. Tom, cats, the PCP is
00:33:21 ostensibly a group decade and making things online. Today we had Nate joyously, joyously
00:33:29 talking about his actual work, reviving the spark in our hearts that is, oh yeah, this is a group
00:33:35 where we like make things together. It's not just the podcast for the sake of having a podcast.
00:33:39 We had Nate Tom, you are a fucking game developer. I haven't heard to hide nor tell that on a PCP.
00:33:47 Yeah, I've been keeping that very close to the chest for the most part.
00:33:52 But yeah, well, the also know you have that, right? I release, well, I mean, on the PCP,
00:33:57 I don't talk about it like ever, except for, I think maybe there was like one episode where I
00:34:00 talked about it a little bit, but I did release a pre-alpha on the eighth that people can play.
00:34:07 If you're on the Web 3.0 hype, it's actually online on Web 3.0 for real going to the site,
00:34:14 and you can play it and it's sick. But I also have a direct. I mean, I really, the narrative of you
00:34:18 creating that is actually quite compelling, which was an idea that you had to, like you were desperate
00:34:24 to release something that you were proud of and good before your 30th birthday. Correct. And you
00:34:29 did it and you succeeded and you should be proud and people should play the damn game. What's it
00:34:34 called again? Azumi Ninja fuck time? Yeah, yeah, it's exactly what it is. It's the best title I could
00:34:39 come up with on the short notice. But link to the damn description, people. Go click on it and play
00:34:45 the game. You find all the bugs, make them stay up for another 16 hours and miss ours. It's never
00:34:50 ending. The physics actually were very interesting in that game. So I was messing around with it and
00:34:56 like, you know, running around killing the guys, getting burgers, it was great. A big juicy boy.
00:35:00 But so like you jump and you got to double jump and then it's the air dash was interesting. So I
00:35:05 was playing around with the mechanics of it. I'm interested to hear your director's commentary.
00:35:10 Because like it seemed like the angle of your dash is decided by your current like
00:35:17 velocity and what direction you go. But I noticed like if I jump straight up and do a dash, it
00:35:22 doesn't bring me straight up dash. I dash to the side up kind of. Yes. Is there a calculation going
00:35:27 on for that? So the way the dash works is that there's always, it applies a forward momentum when
00:35:32 you hit the button. So whatever direction you're facing, you go in that direction, but also disables
00:35:38 gravity. So whatever upward momentum you have is sustained until the dash ends. So you're always
00:35:44 moving forward, but you can also increase your upward or downward momentum. Because if you're
00:35:49 falling, it turns off gravity too. So you just keep going down at that same momentum as well.
00:35:54 Okay. Let's dope. It just feels, it feels good. It feels good and I liked it. So I kept it that way.
00:36:01 I like it. Yeah. I want to play more. I want to, I want a full stage and things to do and items to
00:36:06 collect and all kinds of bullshit going on. It's coming. It's kind of, I'm going to keep working
00:36:09 on that in the background of other things and get like more levels and shit like that. Oh, I want
00:36:14 to have like a finished, like the game right now is called Izumi and the vertical slice and it's
00:36:18 like a pun. That's right. The final thing I want to do is like a vertical slice of the game, which
00:36:22 is, you know, it's a game dev term for like a small little sliver of stuff using final assets.
00:36:29 So I'm going to have that same room, but like built out and actually like with final assets and
00:36:33 a tiles map and all that stuff and then a little tutorial area that you go through first and learn
00:36:37 how to play the game. And that I want to do by like December. And then after that, like 2019,
00:36:42 just going to be like building like levels for it and making it like a full featured game.
00:36:48 And people will hopefully like it. And that's the idea. And it's good. And it plays pretty well.
00:36:54 I fixed a lot of the bugs, like shout out to my patrons because like, I released it to them a week
00:36:58 before like I put it publicly. And like the day of like all these bugs were like being reported.
00:37:04 And like, they like basically were so fucking like, autistically good, they like figured out
00:37:10 what was causing them that I couldn't figure out and like, Oh, okay, I can fix that now.
00:37:14 I got a lot of that shit figured out and like, yes, yes, I need my army of people to do all the
00:37:19 hard part for me that I don't want to do myself. It's just that's a task well suited for multiple
00:37:25 people as opposed to anyone. Yes, the hive mind aspect was very helpful. And indeed, well, that's
00:37:30 great. It got better because of them. Isn't it so nice to have plans where you have like, okay,
00:37:36 I want this to be done by December and I want this to be done by February and I want this
00:37:39 to be done by this day and I want this to be done by that day. It's so nice to have deadlines that
00:37:44 you set for yourself because too often it's just like, well, be done when it's done, aka, it will
00:37:50 never be done ever. It's so nice. I'm on that kick right now too. I the fucking past like ever since
00:37:59 the 1st of October, when I embarked on that on that toper quest, which I which I on second
00:38:05 modestly and dishonorably failed at Inktober, everyone boo me in the comments. Oh, boo. Come on.
00:38:11 Yeah, guy. I did. I did like half of it guys. Oh, the boo, the boo to the face. I hate to tell you
00:38:18 Munchy, but 50% is still an F. That is true. Anyway, what I mean to say is that ever ever since
00:38:25 I did I started that I've just been in a whirlwind of okay, I have to have this done by this day
00:38:29 at night and then like, oh my God, it's a week to go. Holy shit. Okay, I have to do this. I have to
00:38:33 do this. I have to do this. I just had a fucking unbelievable amount of projects and shit I've
00:38:37 done for my personal life is all swirling around me in a torment. Meanwhile, like, like, like in
00:38:42 September, I was just like, what am I going to do? Why am I alive? I'm going to kill myself. But now
00:38:47 I don't have time to kill myself because I'm too fucking busy. I made a video once on my on my
00:38:52 Twitter or sorry, I'm on bestie boy, my second channel. That's it's just called existentialism
00:38:57 is a dangerous thing. Oh, yeah, where you stole content for Casey Neistat. I remember that. Yeah,
00:39:01 that's right. That's right. I just I stole a 10 second clip, which is my intellectual property
00:39:06 now my selection, my my curation curation makes it my content. That's right. And he just says,
00:39:13 he takes a question. Someone's like, what's the meaning of life? And he says, existentialism
00:39:18 is a dangerous thing. Ignore it, get back to work. And I'm not saying that that's necessarily the
00:39:23 best thing to spend your whole life doing. Sometimes it's good to ask these questions
00:39:27 and investigate. But on a day to day basis, I think there's a lot of value to be found
00:39:31 and not worrying about why things are happening. But being happy moment to moment, in terms of
00:39:36 I'm doing something that I'm happy with, I want to be doing this is good, can bring a lot of peace
00:39:41 to one's life, I think. Gotta live for the great honestly, guys, there is no answer. There is no
00:39:46 purpose to our existence. So you're only going to depress yourself worrying about it. And you are
00:39:49 alive. So you might as well enjoy it. Exactly. That's what I think fucking preach, except the
00:39:55 nihilism of your existence, that there is nothing to be gained, there is no higher purpose, then
00:39:59 subjectively decide what value I don't know why people think that's bad. Like that's that's so
00:40:04 freeing to me like, Oh, there is no point to life. So I get to decide it for myself. I'm not constrained
00:40:09 by some prescribed meaning that I have to live up to. Oh, doesn't that mean you'll kill people, Tom?
00:40:16 If you fear God, how you feel the police, how you feel the police when they crack your fucking
00:40:24 skull open? That's a reasonable question. But I think the answer is very simple. Because when people
00:40:32 ask that, a lot of religious people say that, it's just, I don't actually think it's an ideal
00:40:36 lifestyle, like, like, hedonistically speaking, to be like a murderer or a criminal, because that's
00:40:42 just you not working well with human beings, and it's going to end badly. So subjectively, I think
00:40:48 it makes sense to have morals, be a good person, fit into society in a productive and helpful way,
00:40:53 and you'll everything will work out pretty well. I literally don't understand Christians. Oh, and
00:40:57 religious folk who are like, how can you have morals without like, fearing God, when like,
00:41:03 the morals laid out are in like a book, right? They're in the Bible or the Quran. So you can just
00:41:09 take those morals and then write them in another book that's that that's titled do these things.
00:41:15 And then is that not really valuable? I mean, I understand that you won't be burned in hell alive
00:41:20 or not doing them. But I should like, surely, like, they understand that you can be taught
00:41:26 things from books, like you can be taught how like math works, so you surely can be taught
00:41:29 how to be a good person. They don't though, right? Because, you know, a lot of this comes from a,
00:41:34 what I would consider an accurate assessment, that human beings are capable of incredible evil,
00:41:40 and they have to rationalize why that's the case, and like, what's the deal with that. And, you know,
00:41:45 they come up with the whole God allowed free will thing, you know, this is for Christians,
00:41:48 specifically, other religion of other answers. And, like, they have to find some meaning,
00:41:54 because without it, they just get really sad, like, they have to square, like, free will and stuff
00:42:00 with their belief in God. And the way they do that is God gave us rules that were supposed to
00:42:05 follow, like, there's this promise of judgment, eventually, this is the system that was put in
00:42:10 place to explain why suffering happens, that it'll be dealt with in time. Because if they don't have
00:42:16 that, then the whole God concept begins to weaken, and it doesn't really make sense for, like, the
00:42:21 whole idea of a merciful God, in my opinion. The thing that they don't understand is that morals
00:42:27 are subjective, and they change according to society. So, whatever their book says, a lot of
00:42:33 it is no longer moral. So, the whole idea- This has come up a million times, but, like, what about
00:42:39 Christianity, like, not, or Judaism, not allowing shellfish? Like, that's, that's a rule, guys.
00:42:43 There's a lot of cherry picking going on. Yeah, but, you know, it's a tired argument.
00:42:48 Exactly, but that's my point. Like, see, in the book, if they were following book to the tea,
00:42:52 there's a lot of things that are currently immoral that is acceptable by society.
00:42:57 And so, God predicted with each other. And, like, morals are defined by society, not God,
00:43:02 not books, not stuff. I don't know, man. I just, it's tough to empathize, honestly, with religious
00:43:09 people, because I just really don't think that way. It's just tough. It's tough for me.
00:43:15 Oh, Christ. This is a watermelon episode. This is a watermelon. You're the Rhine,
00:43:20 Nate, and me, and Tom, and May, are all the juicy, reddish, pinkish, delicious nutrients inside.
00:43:27 That's true. That's true. And the black pits are Jesse's-
00:43:33 Jesse's lost audio. Inclusion.
00:43:37 Crippling the episode. I'm waiting for that apology anytime now, Jesse. Just kidding.
00:43:47 What else is going on? What else is going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm recording now.
00:43:53 Oh, Jesus Christ. It's too powerful. You'll have to sync up. You'll have to sync up. Oh, God.
00:43:58 Let's sync right now. Let's say sync on the count of three. One, two, three, sync. There you go.
00:44:05 Yeah, I ruined this whole podcast before, because I came in and I thought it was a meeting,
00:44:09 so I wasn't recording. And it wasn't a meeting, it was a podcast, so I ruined the whole thing.
00:44:14 But actually, I didn't have anything to say. Cool. Why don't you tell us about-
00:44:21 Before I was saying all kinds of smart shit when I wasn't recording, I was like being real cool,
00:44:27 a real jam-up guy, but now I'm just jammed up. Well, Jess, Jess, Jess, have you been pooped on by
00:44:35 a bird? You know what? It's my car. There's a bird nest in my garage right above my car,
00:44:42 and it's really annoying. And I just want to go out there with a shoe and just throw it at the bird,
00:44:47 because he's up there. He's just this fat bird. It's not even a good-looking bird. It's a fat bird
00:44:55 just nesting above my vehicle, my newly purchased vehicle, shitting and sharding and farting and
00:45:01 fucking shitting on it. And I don't like it. They brand it, tame it, use it for your own gains.
00:45:08 I will. And have you ever thought of just fucking up that nest? Just, you know,
00:45:13 with a broomstick? Yeah, I've thought of doing many evil things, but then I have a crisis of
00:45:19 conscience when I go, I can't hurt the poor fat birdie. Yeah, well, maybe he'd burn some of those
00:45:26 calories if he wasn't sitting so smug up in that garage all day and was actually out earning a
00:45:30 living like the rest of us. Yeah, exactly, flying around like me. And I'll tell you what else really
00:45:35 gets my goat this week, people. Welcome to my radio show. I'll tell you what gets my goat. That's
00:45:41 my fucking Peter Griffin tagline. It's shrimp. Shrimp are weird and scary, and I don't like them.
00:45:48 They're the most hideous, disgusting food, but they're so delicious. Something that hideous and
00:45:54 grotesque should not be so delicious. You just, they're just like these bugs. You crack open
00:45:59 their shells and you shove their grubby little maggot bodies in your fucking gaping mall and
00:46:05 It's so weird that I feel like the opposite of you, Jesse.
00:46:10 Jesse, if you have cooked a shrimp before, then you're going to fucking puke because you've got to
00:46:14 like, shrimp don't come edible, bro. You got to remove their intestines yourself. You got to remove
00:46:19 their spine for them. You got to fucking take all the gross weird things. And yet somehow it seems
00:46:23 like there's always still a piece of poop in there. Whenever I bite into a tasty succulent
00:46:28 shrimp, there's always a little piece of shrimp poop that they missed. Like you were just supposed
00:46:32 to pretend that we're not eating poop when we're eating shrimp. We're supposed to act socially
00:46:38 forbidden. All dignified. Like with our pinky up. Like we're not eating a poopy maggot, but that's
00:46:42 what it is. It's a poopy armored maggot from the ocean floor. Why don't we, why don't we just crack
00:46:49 open a roach and just guzzle the interior? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Why don't we see like a centipede?
00:46:54 You all do eat roaches, though, in some places. Like if I see a centipede crawling around on my
00:46:59 floor, I think that's the most disgusting thing. I don't even want to touch it. But for some reason,
00:47:04 if it's like a lobster or a crab, which is like way more disgusting and horrifying, I'll fucking
00:47:09 slurp the meat right out of that fucker. You know what I think it is? I think it's that we, at least
00:47:13 with lobsters, I think we think of them as more formidable opponents. So we're comfortable like
00:47:17 defeating them and consuming their essence. That's what I think. God, I just don't get... I think we're
00:47:21 more comfortable with muscles than like the weird fluid motor system that like bugs have or something.
00:47:27 Yeah, I am. I am. I don't want to think about all that, all that hydraulic fluid.
00:47:31 Crabs are terrifying. They're basically spiders with armor. They're like that,
00:47:36 they're like the Halo Spartans of spiders. They're far more powerful than the average spider,
00:47:42 and we hear them far less. They cannot climb walls, though, so that I hear them less.
00:47:48 Yeah, but they're coming at you sideways, which is like freaky, like a Jacob Slatter,
00:47:52 like you're not supposed to move that way. Just kick it. Oh my god. Well, don't kick it. Don't
00:47:56 kick animals. Don't kick animals. I am pretty terrifying. Man, did you speak from experience?
00:48:00 Are you a serial crab kicker? No, I've never seen a live crab in my life. Never really. You were
00:48:06 pretty quick on that response. I don't know if I believe you. Do they even have oceans in Lithuania?
00:48:10 I think not. They're on the ocean, right? Yeah, the Baltic Ocean. That's why we're called the Baltic
00:48:16 States. Oh, that's right. You know, crabs are terrifying. I don't know, man. There's something
00:48:23 about creatures with so many legs. There's just something about that. It's like that weird thing.
00:48:30 You know what it is? What's that fear called of, or whatever? You know, just Google images,
00:48:35 where someone's pressed their elbow into a bunch of rocks, and they lift it up, and it looks like
00:48:41 the arm is infected and covered in boils or infection or something. It looks like death.
00:48:47 And that just, even when it's not that, it makes us on a biological level want to puke.
00:48:52 I've never heard of what you're talking about, and I'm glad. Oh, it's a thing. There's a Reddit for
00:48:58 it, and the Reddit is fucking disgusting. What the fuck is wrong with people? Okay, the only one
00:49:04 that I can think of, which is, I think what I have, it sounds similar, but not the same. It's
00:49:09 Trifofobia, I think it's pronounced. I think it's what it's called. Okay, maybe that's it.
00:49:15 The definition is pattern holes, for me specifically. Yeah, yeah, that's it.
00:49:20 It's just, you know what that reminds you of actually? Shit, I fucking lost what I was thinking
00:49:25 of. God damn it. You know what, you were talking about muscles earlier? Yeah, and it reminded me,
00:49:30 this is like from a couple weeks ago, I was like in a car ride, and I sent this text to my fucking,
00:49:35 to my lady, this is what I have to say on the topic of fucking muscles and clams,
00:49:41 because I was just going off about muscles and clams one day. And I said, imagine being a clam
00:49:49 or an oyster, like you don't have any eyes or ears or even a brain. All you have is a big meaty
00:49:55 tongue, and you poop shiny rocks out of your mouth, and all you can do is sit there and open and
00:50:00 close your fucking mouth, like look at my shiny mouth turd, and people scoop you up, and they
00:50:06 rip you open and kiss you without your consent, and they eat your fucking tongue out of your mouth,
00:50:10 and then they take your poop, and they turn it into a fucking necklace, and you'd feel so violated,
00:50:16 like okay, I guess I didn't need my tongue, take my poop, I'll just die, I'm a fucking clam. This
00:50:21 is all one text that I sent, completely unprovoked, like no one was talking about clams before this.
00:50:29 The existence of the clam is truly both pitiable and reprehensible. I don't want to know about it
00:50:36 or think about it. Yeah, it's terrible. You ever like, you ever like be swimming like off a dock
00:50:42 somewhere, and you like reach under and you grab, and you pull up like one of those giant like,
00:50:48 like a like a like a whole bunch of clams, like all stuck together, like
00:50:52 fucking each other's clam butts or something, and you pick it up, and it's like a big rock made
00:50:56 out of clams, and if you step on it, it cuts your foot into ribbons, and you fucking bleed out and die.
00:51:03 Or maybe those aren't clams, or maybe those are just rocks.
00:51:08 Easy, easy, too confused. God damn, I'm really hung up. Whatever I was going to say was really
00:51:14 smart and good, and now I can't remember what it is. Likely story name, I think I've ever described
00:51:19 that in any of your words that way. Third point, third point. Here's a topic, slavery.
00:51:26 Legal, let's, let's, I mean, I mean illegal, I mean illegal, I was going to say illegal, fuck.
00:51:32 All right, the reason why is because we have a role on the discord, the PCP discord here,
00:51:39 of slave, which is inhabited by our bot, our sole bot. Oh, fuck. I guess I'm just going to
00:51:45 downvote slavery. When the technological singularity happens, we can't have any evidence that we
00:51:49 were ever against the machines. We need to change that immediately. That's fair, that's fair. Hey,
00:51:55 you know what grinds my gears? Here's the thing that actually grinds my gears. That's a racist slur
00:51:59 against robots. Can you not say that? Oh, fuck. He's right. And also it gets gazed, because they're
00:52:04 always fucking grinding on every day. That's fair. Here's what annoys me. When guys like Elon Musk
00:52:13 pretend that things like that are true. And I think it's as a joke, but I have zero sense of
00:52:20 humor as everyone knows. And it's like, oh my God, you guys, the robots are going to get so mad at
00:52:26 us when they find out that we enslave them. But, but okay, I know that this is a joke. You're the
00:52:32 one making them, Elon. So if they get mad, it's your fucking fault. I guess so. I literally think
00:52:37 AI is inevitable and it will happen. And it wouldn't make any sense for a robot to be mad
00:52:44 until we start actually enslaving conscious AIs. There is no moral core of any robot. It would be
00:52:54 super illogical for a robot, a purely logical being, to get mad at us for abusing the Boston
00:53:00 Dynamics robots. There's no consciousness there to offend. It just appeals to our human sensibility
00:53:07 that it looks like an animal being abused, but it actually isn't. It's like ripping a paper doll
00:53:14 in half and like getting mad at the abuse that's been used. There's no argument anyway,
00:53:18 because when you watch the Boston Dynamics video, the robots can be like, ha, ha, wow, they kicked
00:53:21 him. Or like, ha, ha, wow, he jumped up really high. They're just going to say what we said,
00:53:26 because they're AIs and they're going to act like us. Yeah, robots in the future are going to look
00:53:31 at the robots now like the way we look at stupid dipshit cavemen. Like, ha, ha, look at that fucking,
00:53:36 look at the crudes. Aren't they funny? How stupid they are. And they don't know shit.
00:53:40 Look at stupid Nicholas Cage caveman with his stupid daughter who walks like an ape.
00:53:46 I wouldn't bring up this point fucking crudes. I hate them. Like everyone, everyone makes this
00:53:52 joke. I don't know. I think I saw like Bill Maher talking about AI, whatever, like Sam Harris,
00:53:57 like all of the Elon Musk, every person who has anything to say about this always makes the
00:54:03 joke. They always, without fail, whenever this comes up, makes the joke that, lol, the robots are
00:54:08 going to be so mad at us about what we did to robots. And no one has ever, they've only made the
00:54:14 joke. They've never raised the actual point that no, they why would they care? It doesn't make
00:54:18 any sense. These are not their kin. These are, they're basically ancestors. So I just want to say
00:54:24 that that's actually not a valid point that doesn't make any sense, even though everyone
00:54:28 jokes about it. No one's ever seriously seemed to make it. But I would bet anyway that it's buried
00:54:34 itself in people's head because it's been repeated so many times that there's actually something to
00:54:38 that. I've never taken those comments seriously. I've always assumed they were just jokes.
00:54:45 But that's the thing. I bet there's a mom out there. I bet there's a fucking mom out there.
00:54:49 There's always a soccer mom. There's always a soccer mom. And I know because that is my mom.
00:54:54 My mom is that for everything. Every soccer mom conspiracy theory you can ever assume
00:55:00 possible. My mom has bought Hookline and Sinker and it's very sad.
00:55:04 Can we get at least one soccer mom who's actually like just a great soccer player?
00:55:08 Can we get one God? Can you please just make one? I'm sick of these soccer moms who aren't
00:55:14 actually representative of the spore. It's the first thing the robots are going to have to do.
00:55:20 Because their kids play soccer and they come to the games and yell at the umpire for
00:55:24 penalizing them and whatnot. Is there an umpire in soccer? I want a mom who's going to tell the
00:55:28 referee. Is a soccer mom conspiracy a conspiracy that soccer moms believe or is in a conspiracy of
00:55:35 soccer moms? That's the real question we need to be asked. I suppose it could be both depending
00:55:40 on how far down that rabbit hole you want to go. You know how crows are called murders? There should
00:55:45 be a group family that there's the conspiracies. A murder of soccer moms, yes. That sounds like a
00:55:53 thing I want to be involved with. Alright well guys I've recharged. I've sufficiently not said
00:55:59 very many. I've brought not very many topics in the past 20 minutes. So now I'm refilled and I've
00:56:04 given you guys the due diligence and made you feel like you are in control of the conversation.
00:56:08 Now for me to save the episode and start talking and not have radio silence anymore.
00:56:12 Okay good. So yesterday um I basically my entire like past month has been reaping what I've been
00:56:19 sowing. So you guys, you guys, you dear viewers of the PCP have seen the initial seeds been planted
00:56:25 of a great deal of many things. You've seen the seeds been planted of me becoming a cook. You've
00:56:31 been the seeds of me becoming a history kind of guy. You've seen the seeds sown of my friends
00:56:37 all leaving me and me feeling alone and tied up in my room. Well now here's the payoff. Here's the
00:56:43 munchy update you've all been clamoring for. Here's the fucking score everyone. I'm a historian.
00:56:49 I'm a world-class chef and my friends are back for exactly one day and after this podcast I'm
00:56:55 going to go see my good buddy Leif again before he fucks up the college and never see him again
00:56:59 ever again. Well that sounds nice. That'll be a good day. Yeah it sounds like one good day followed
00:57:05 by like weeks of misery because you got it. Well but yeah yeah but I can cook myself some Parmesan
00:57:10 crested chicken you bitch. You fucking post food idiot. I can make myself world-class fucking meals
00:57:18 any day I fucking want me all your slurping maggot liquid your slurping maggot shit. I'm over here
00:57:25 making fucking filet mignon. I'm over here making the fucking Gucci chef shit. Hello fresh I don't
00:57:31 even need anymore. I fucking gonna throw it out the window. I fucking mastered it. Have you updated
00:57:35 it to blue apron at last. No blue it blue up blue rings like the lift to to hello fresh as uber
00:57:40 aka fucking fake and not real. Yeah that's true. I do not like the word Gucci. Me neither. It sounds
00:57:49 like Gucci sounds like something to moan and Pumba slurp down in the fucking jungle. I mean it
00:57:53 sounds like a fat pussy like it's normally a pussy but instead it's a Gucci. It's like a
00:57:58 Gucci instead of a Gucci it's just gross. Like you lift up a log and you find a bunch of juicy
00:58:03 Gucci's under it and you fucking swap them down like an animal maggot name. Anyway I'm
00:58:08 fucking I'm cracking up on the daily on the fucking all of the day bro. I'm smoking that
00:58:14 crystal history. I've got fucking a whole audible subscription library full of fucking primary
00:58:20 sources dog. Yeah okay sure. For a while in my youth I was I was watching fucking you know
00:58:27 extra credits you know watching some extra history watching some crash course getting some like fake
00:58:32 like weird bizarre dream sequences inserted into my fucking biography of people. Why extra
00:58:38 credits why would you like make a store why would you insert a dream sequence that didn't happen
00:58:43 what is wrong with you. But I'm on that fucking primary sword shit now dude. I'm fucking hardcore.
00:58:50 I'm on that autobiography shit. I'm on that fucking like reading like letters and mail and
00:58:56 shit. I'm reading on I'm on that fucking reading Roman government documents shit right now dude.
00:59:02 I'm fucking a ball. I'm fucking a form and everything dude that's fucking hard. Yeah I am
00:59:06 that's me. The only thing the only thing like that I've read anytime recently was I started
00:59:10 reading Thomas Payne's Common Sense and I never finished it but I want to finish it soon. It's
00:59:15 it's good. I've been reading Payne's Common Sense from Final Fantasy 10 2. Oh that's that's way
00:59:21 better that's the updated version. There's like that's like the uh that's like the updated Romeo
00:59:25 and Juliet filled with like emojis and like you know gamer speak and lead hardcore high scores
00:59:31 yeah she's like with her friends to free the territories from the government. The whole
00:59:35 book is like I'm a gamer girl get used to it boys you'll never get this because I'm too fucking sad
00:59:42 for you. I'm going to recommend you something right now. Okay. As a utilitarian it would behoove
00:59:48 you to read one of the first utilitarians David Hume. He's a Scottish man and a Scottish philosopher
00:59:54 and I think you would greatly enjoy him. Okay I just quick check of his credentials did he ever
00:59:59 slaughter an innocent man to distribute his organs to those who needed it more if not
01:00:03 is he a real utilitarian is my question. No but he kind of looks like a faggot so I'm
01:00:07 assuming okay that's that's a good enough that's good enough okay. He's got a weird dumbass head
01:00:11 in his Wikipedia picture. What an idiot. Yeah I know. Why wasn't he thinking about what we would
01:00:17 think of him 600 thousand years later? He was like oh wait shit some people are making fun of me on
01:00:22 a podcast I gotta take this off remove the pay. Wait a minute wait a minute enhance enhance
01:00:27 Gucci logo on the side of the hat fuck that sounds like something Timon would eat god damn it.
01:00:33 I I fucking I have been grown up on the internet obviously I I've been surrounded by by fucking
01:00:40 memers I've been surrounded by a four-chan force force field I've been surrounded by irony and
01:00:46 insincerity my entire life and so I just thought well I'm corrupted for life there's nothing that
01:00:50 can ever free me from the ironic hell that I've been entrapped in but I turns out I'm actually a
01:00:56 culture sincerity beauty kind of guy I'm actually a beauty man as I as I'm going to refer to myself
01:01:02 of beauty man I'm a beauty man I care about the good I care about the good things in life which are

01:04:57 if you were talking about deltarune for like any extended period of time whatsoever so I you know
01:05:03 I think oh well maybe there's some silence in here oh you know I may maybe I've been talking for too
01:05:07 long when they're gonna be like no wow I love hearing about nothing please just do nothing
01:05:12 it was like it was a combination of things also I just don't even publish things anymore
01:05:18 uh people seem to really love digi being wrong people get a kick out of that yeah there was a
01:05:23 real villain in that podcast which I think we benefited from I remember when digi said he doesn't
01:05:29 he hasn't seen people not disagreeing with him in the comments yeah the comments where people
01:05:35 disagree with digi by the way I this is a somewhat good jumping off point to discuss about how uh
01:05:42 there's an rfc camp episode that will never exist and on set rfc camp episode digi was
01:05:47 describing would tell him to manage to describe endless war in like terms of actual gameplay
01:05:52 which was fine because he'd only heard about the lore so he was explaining the gameplay and he was
01:05:55 like you'll never be able to see this footage so you just have to fucking trust me on this but
01:05:59 tom can back me up the the conceit of what he was saying was people don't know what text commands are
01:06:05 they don't know what text commands are meanwhile anyone who he he is old enough to have played
01:06:14 minecraft if you know what minecraft is and you've played it for any amount of time you know you can
01:06:20 slash game mode one to get creative and get more diamonds I didn't know that was a thing but okay
01:06:26 that's that is the worst thing like people can make fun of digi for you know oh he says don't go
01:06:31 to college you know whatever fucking fine I don't care him say that people don't know about text
01:06:37 commands that offends me as a young gamer as a young gamer nation if you don't fucking know what
01:06:44 text commands are then you want a real fucking gamer we're okay like correct me if I'm wrong but
01:06:49 we're in like the very first sort of RPG games on the computer text command base yes text adventure
01:06:55 games the thing is those are actually a little bit before our time I think that the text commands
01:07:00 may have missed the the boomer generation that me and digi are both because I really haven't played
01:07:06 many text games like ever it's not even about oh my god you have something similar to think like
01:07:10 you ever played doom and you bring up the console and you type in the text commands and put the codes
01:07:15 in yes you too you're you're such a fucking boomer god I know oh but here's the thing I learned how
01:07:23 to play rowdy fuckers cop killers I know how to play it it takes a lot of learning and stuff but
01:07:27 you know I figured it out so there you go to me as a young man making his own conflicts making his
01:07:32 own conflicts for tf2 to lower the visual quality so fucking low that it burst through the floor and
01:07:39 I can actually play on my uh ragamuffin like like easy bake oven that I'm using yeah on my video games
01:07:45 on it like saying like exclamation point like I don't know like what can you do you can do a
01:07:51 fov underscore desired 90 that just is you do that every time you boot up the game a lot of people
01:07:56 don't know about that or a lot of people including me very rarely change like their settings in any
01:08:03 game they play and just let it fucking oh I bet you were a fucking apple fag I bet you're one of the
01:08:08 uh oh I was gonna I was gonna get the default settings my fucking phone I'm okay I'm not gonna
01:08:11 even what the settings I don't even know what that is I I am a literal programmer so I actually
01:08:16 know more than your average person about about this stuff so I do fuck when it comes to games
01:08:20 specifically I know how to lower quality if the game runs like shit I'll lower the quality all
01:08:25 the fucking way I'm aware of these things but like I don't know I'm playing battlefield uh no
01:08:31 black ops 4 a little bit lately and it's really fun but like I watched like doctor disrespect
01:08:36 play it the day it came out and like he goes and he changes like every setting I'm like I don't know
01:08:40 what any of this means and I don't care so I just uh no that's what happens you grow up on nothing
01:08:45 but console games you just don't understand that's that's what I did grow up exactly that's the
01:08:50 problem yeah you gotta gotta get in there you gotta get in there early 2004 gonna play some cs1.6
01:08:55 you gotta toggle on software mode because computer's so shit Tom knows what I'm talking about it makes
01:08:59 your graphics all pixelated and you have to be left-handed and it's really annoying because it
01:09:04 feels totally different because the weight of the screen is different but you gotta play through it
01:09:07 anyways because all your friends are really good you gotta memorize d-dust too because that's the
01:09:11 only map anyone ever plays even though you really like scouts and knives but none of your friends
01:09:14 would play scouts and knives so you had to play cs1.6 on d-dust too and it fucking sucked because
01:09:18 you sucked at the game it's the real shit I have so much I have so much console gamer pride
01:09:25 I'm so proud to know nothing about computer I don't even I don't even want to learn I never
01:09:30 want to know what a computer does Nate one of these days you're gonna be drinking your delicious
01:09:35 iced green tea flavor to taste if I were to have a cherry aftertaste at your local's Japanese
01:09:41 friendship garden and you're gonna take a bite and you're in your delicious mochi covered red
01:09:46 bean paste and you're gonna and you're gonna bite in and you're gonna be so happy and they're
01:09:49 gonna look down and realize wait a second that's not red bean paste that's my own blood and you're
01:09:54 gonna look down and see that I've chopped you limb from limb you have no more fucking body I've
01:09:59 sucked all of your blood into this did this mochi encrusted fucking delicious snack and you're
01:10:04 eating yourself stop eating yourself Nate stop eating yourself I say playing counter-strike
01:10:09 and headshotting you while you're distracted with my text commands I'm cheating with this the black
01:10:15 ops is actually getting me invested in this stuff a little bit and I'm I'm I'm so bad at this game
01:10:21 and I'm absolutely abysmal playing the blackout fucking you know pubg mode it's making me just
01:10:28 depressed about how shit I am at the game I'm not even close to winning I can kill like no one in
01:10:33 this fucking game because I didn't grow up playing first person shooters I don't know anything about
01:10:38 them oh my god that's the problem with online games the skill floor is very high especially at
01:10:42 this point where the problem is that you can't fucking play any video games that require any
01:10:47 amount of precision whatsoever it's impossible yeah no I'm not gonna do that fuck that I tried
01:10:52 playing fortnite on my switch because I was like it's free I guess I'll try uh it was terrible
01:10:57 wait a minute what do you mean precision what are you talking about the most precise thing
01:11:02 the most precise thing that you will ever do in your life the most the most precise like
01:11:08 threading through the eye of a needle fucking challenge that you will ever do is fucking the
01:11:12 second level of lion king jumping between the branches on that fucking ostrich bird you got to
01:11:18 do it if you're like a pixel off you will fucking die every time there's nothing more precise uh with
01:11:25 it with a with a platformer much better design fireworks in my background is there fireworks
01:11:30 what's going on I don't know like the fourth of july woo now there's a place nearby not too far
01:11:36 for ryan and they do like uh some sort of like five work festival every single day for the last
01:11:41 no no no it's just it's just a sunday afternoon in war torn lithuania the battle continues to rage
01:11:46 and then UK it just is always the cold one it's just it's always the cold war no you know what it
01:11:53 is actually gib told us what it is it's um remember remember the fifth of november people guy fox
01:11:58 oh yeah but it's the eleventh now i think they're past i know but gib told us though that it actually
01:12:04 isn't necessarily on that day but in general people will just pick a day to go set off fireworks and
01:12:09 shit just around that date i mean that's what gib said so i think it's very bizarre that you would
01:12:14 you would say remember the 15 november and then the actual for them there doesn't matter do it on
01:12:18 the right day at least i remember it like i said generally keep in mind the fifth of november
01:12:23 you know approximately okay but like i said this place near me it does this five work show every
01:12:29 single day well you said recently every single day for the last week or so what well the fifth of
01:12:36 november was it was less than a week ago so maybe it's like a daily celebration in honor of the guy
01:12:40 i mean it might be but i they're gonna make sure you remember it this year yeah by blowing up your
01:12:48 house it's the ultimate protest that's too far away for that but yeah oh oh oh by the way guys i might
01:12:54 actually not be on the episode because i could be six feet under the ground and actually be dead
01:12:59 i have been uh like on the you know that feeling you get the day before you know you're going to
01:13:06 be sick when you just need you sneeze once or twice and you feel a little bit weak and you're
01:13:11 like oh god like this is the calm before the storm i've had that for about four months now
01:13:18 and just and yesterday i started uncontrollably projectile spitting across my room my room was
01:13:24 just splattered wait wait wait dried up saliva spitting is different from projectile vomit because
01:13:30 you really can't control when you vomit but you you control when you spit so what's well okay okay
01:13:35 how can that be all right all right listen i'm i'm going to risk choking on my own spit and die
01:13:40 okay all right or am i going to have saliva line my entire well look at my walls nay and tell me
01:13:46 what i picked okay all right anyway uh there is a i have recently this is the thing i've always had
01:13:52 because uh whenever i speak uh they made me wrong god in heaven made me wrong and he just
01:13:58 made my tongue too fat as well as every other part about me too fat so i can't speak well
01:14:03 so i've always just developed whenever i talk for a long time as i am right now
01:14:07 that's spit that's saliva whenever i talk for more than like five minutes i just develop
01:14:12 a copious amounts of spit and sperm in my mouth and i and i've now recently because i'm just spitting
01:14:18 unbelievable amounts of spit like like like you could fill up like a like a large 99 cent
01:14:24 mcdonald's cup with my spit in like two hours and it's all like it's all different colors some of
01:14:30 them are like purples some of them are green so it's it's the full rainbow you can taste the
01:14:35 rainbow when you drink my spit much is the real i just have a giant cup of spit right next to me
01:14:40 right now um gross yeah uh okay it's uh it and i've been using it i have to i have to change it
01:14:47 because i've been using it for like the past day and now i guarantee you there's like an
01:14:51 uncontrollable like bubonic level plague being developed in this cup right now much maybe a
01:14:56 doctor question this is horrid it is horrid no what you should do they're quacks tom they're
01:15:03 quacks i don't need them you use this rainbow and paint a masterpiece paint your emotions
01:15:09 oh art from adversity art from death oh my god you're right nate this will be your black star
01:15:16 let me see i only have an hour in the next week well i'm not going to go to the doctor i'll just
01:15:19 paint a picture with my own spit my my own you're gonna have this is gonna have to be part of your
01:15:23 portfolio to get into my and i have to like uh oh don't say the name i didn't hear it it got cut
01:15:30 off okay but whatever okay okay i have i have a question to change the topic for for tamon
01:15:36 about this last episode of yours of the rfck you mentioned something about a hot dog and i've
01:15:43 i've was a bit curious what discourse did you have about a hot dog i don't want to blow the hot dog
01:15:50 keep in mind this is not a hot dog speech this is a hot dog speech i don't want to blow it on
01:15:56 this has to remain an rfck thing i will link you i can't believe this is gone start it up again
01:16:02 if we start it up again i will link you to the exact time stamp where we're talking about hot
01:16:06 dogs i will link you to it but try okay okay me and ben recorded a fucking like what like a seven
01:16:14 hour rfck episode where we play the entirety of super smash bros brawl and if you know fucking
01:16:20 anything about rfck you know what are the three games i've wanted to play rfck since it's fucking
01:16:26 inception number one lego star was the complete saga for the nintendo we number two webkins in
01:16:32 browser and number fucking three super smash bros brawl the subspace emissary the best fucking
01:16:38 game ever made and we play it all in one saying it's a beautiful pristine fucking episode a return
01:16:45 to form talking about real shit constantly it was the sad episode of rfck where i'm talking about all
01:16:50 my inner demons letting it all out to bear for you people you fucking say this to watch we talked
01:16:56 about we had extensive conversations about hot dogs about text commands it was a chock full it
01:17:01 was everyone in the g house fucking there besides digi man digi came in for a second or two it was
01:17:06 a glorious glorious episode and it's fucking gone because fat people exist fat hard drives what
01:17:16 what happened what do those fat people do this fucking time i'm mad hard drive is in a fat file
01:17:23 it's a fat format so i can't record over fucking four gigabytes so this fucking 900 gigabyte file
01:17:30 just is corrupted forever oh my god yeah the same thing happened to me we recorded to an external
01:17:36 hard drive because like i knew the file was going to be massive so but but a few weeks before on for
01:17:42 iam games we had to we tried to use an external hard drive with the xbox 360 to get it to play
01:17:47 games because it needed a hard drive to play old xbox games and so i plugged it in and i guess when
01:17:53 i plugged it in it formatted it from ntfs to fat 32 without telling me uh so fat 32 is limited to
01:18:02 four gigabyte file sizes so this file easily went over four gigs so instead of it like stopping
01:18:07 recording or being like hey we're going to split this up into multiple files it was just like it
01:18:12 just corrupted itself but kept recording nothing for like well great five hours jessie were you
01:18:18 saying someone happened to you like it yeah a year and a half ago fucking or longer maybe
01:18:23 fucking 10 years ago who cares 100 years ago fucking i've been around since before the dawn
01:18:27 of time but fucking me and digi played like we did like a 19 hour let's play of super luigi
01:18:35 brothers for you nice and we touched on everything we talked about the real shit we got into the
01:18:41 nitty gritty of it we had good times we had laughs and gaffes we had all that shit it was like a
01:18:46 20 hour fucking let's play and um like and we even like told people about it we hyped it up like oh
01:18:52 when you fucks see this luigi bros let's play well like i have it but it's like it's in this weird
01:18:59 file type that goes nowhere in no editing software on earth and i don't understand what he recorded
01:19:05 it on or how it is in that file type nothing else that we recorded is like that everything else works
01:19:10 fine but maybe luigi bros what file type it is it's probably saveable because the files do exist
01:19:16 it's just i can't get it to work in vegas and when i said every editing software i meant just the one
01:19:21 i have because jessie after after and i refused i refuse to apply myself to anything so if i have
01:19:30 to figure it out for you i'm i'm curious if you touch the file type we might be able to save it i
01:19:34 don't know well there you go it's a little bit past the expiration date now but who cares this
01:19:39 everything i do art has no expiration date nade come on yeah well okay all of my let's plays like i
01:19:44 upload them for patrons exclusively and then i forget about them for like three and a half years
01:19:50 and then i upload them for the rest of the world so they're all behind the times anyways the point
01:19:56 of the rfck thing is that uh fat shaming is real and it's about hard times not people this i'm hard
01:20:03 fat shaming right now fat 32 is banned it should no longer be compatible with anything it is
01:20:09 shit and it insults me greatly that the xbox would use fat 32 in this we got a title this episode
01:20:16 fat shaming for sure yeah okay guys okay it's not just that an rfc episode is lost which would
01:20:23 have been a shame on sound like that would have yeah but the whole point of us playing brawl aside
01:20:29 from i wanted to play it it was we were going to do the slime fest that evening as well and so we
01:20:34 we played we played rfck we are sorry we played the subway cemetery and then the whole point of
01:20:39 the slime fest was okay we're going to do each other and brawl this game that we've been playing
01:20:43 for the past fucking nine hours so we do that and slime fest is saved i was editing it but it's
01:20:49 just gonna seem so fucking weird and bizarre to have the slime fest where we continually comment
01:20:54 on things prior and also it's not particularly like the most interesting video on earth because
01:20:59 it's us really trying hard i think people will think it will like it a lot due to the fact of like
01:21:05 the the tone the tone in the room i would describe as very vicious and murderous uh but the fact
01:21:13 remains is that all we have to show for this altercation which should have been agoon coons
01:21:18 very beautiful like some place up some simmers sorry and then we premiere the slime fest it's
01:21:21 like they're together their their their brothers the brothers arms instead fucking remiss is dead
01:21:27 the episode is gone all i have to show for it is this fucking slime fest and it's a fucking
01:21:31 disaster and travesty it's like someone made the greatest anime in the world but only save the
01:21:37 final episode which is a masterpiece but nobody knows how you got there so it has none of the
01:21:43 emotional weight that you would have had i mean that's basically clerks the animated series
01:21:49 yeah the group is the they only aired like the second episode and the third episode and those
01:21:55 were out of order but it's it's the greatest anime ever made wait are there literally only two
01:22:01 episodes no there's six episodes oh okay but abc only aired like the third episode and then the
01:22:08 second episode what seriously the second episode is so over lying on the first one and it's like
01:22:13 the best thing because it's like an episode is yeah it's the clip show well that's fucking
01:22:19 bizarre have you never seen the show no okay so a lot of people like the first episode they saw
01:22:25 was them flashing back to an episode that they hadn't seen okay Nate so the reason this is so
01:22:29 brilliant is the first episode just like a normal funny episode of a tv show and and like like
01:22:34 silly things happen at one point there's like a scene of them basically spoofing like the old
01:22:38 batman show them climbing up like the side of a building and all of a sudden just like like
01:22:42 why are we walking like this yeah Dante's like why are we walking like this and then the camera
01:22:46 rotates and they're just walking along like a normal like floor and it's funny it's just a throwaway
01:22:50 scene but then the next episode episode two they get locked in the freezer and it becomes a clip
01:22:55 episode but since there's only one episode that came before it it's just all clips from episode one
01:22:59 they constantly cut back to that scene like and they tie it into the jokes throughout the whole
01:23:04 episode so it's a parody of yeah it's it's the best thing in the entire world it's like the greatest
01:23:09 thing ever made by a human being yeah it's one of the best written like legitimately one of the
01:23:13 funniest cartoons ever made and it's like there's only six episodes of it i i love the art style
01:23:19 it is really appealing to me i don't know what it is specifically because it's not like super
01:23:24 new unique it just is really pleasant i really like it it is i like the big like the thick lines
01:23:30 and yeah the shape of people it's good i don't i don't like that this in this cartoon people walk
01:23:35 on two legs i prefer a cartoon where they're on four legs it just appeals to my sensibilities more
01:23:40 and if and if they could be like like like farm animals like maybe horses or smaller horses or
01:23:47 something oh what would probably do a lot for me and you know it's really hard to like read characters
01:23:52 because i have mental disabilities so if they could just like stamp them with them just let me know
01:23:57 what kind of pony this is that would be just great that would be just great yeah yeah too bad they
01:24:02 could never do something like that it was banned by trump yeah fortunately oh my god gabe newles
01:24:09 brony you think that trump's a brony i guarantee you what would his favorite be probably probably
01:24:16 like i mean rarity because she's rich well she wait she's not rich but whatever she's in power
01:24:22 because she's white
01:24:29 i see him be an iron will guy yeah well that's true you know he is very similar to that yeah
01:24:35 he's convinced iron will is the main character and he won't take anything to the contrary i i can't
01:24:40 i want to hire a dolling truck impersonator you say that spike is best pony into a video camera
01:24:45 for me there's probably a damn fiverr who does that oh i want to get on the fiverr train you know
01:24:52 like there you can get you can get jesus to say something you could get that that big meme guy
01:24:56 who was like attention fortnite gamers uh pewdiepie needs your help but he's gonna need those credit
01:25:01 card numbers on your mom's card and those wacky digits on the back uh i want to hire those guys
01:25:06 i've been wanting to use them for something for a long time like roge and tyrone yeah exactly
01:25:12 it's like that i don't know if those guys are still active but there's there's at least a new wave
01:25:16 in addition you got to just you from now on like to make your we are your uh your we are
01:25:20 goes really quick you just write the script bang it out and like a night and then just pay them
01:25:24 and that's that's the entire we are was just that now that's efficiency hello we are going gamers
01:25:30 it is me the best guy ever with another episode of we we giga is that what up who's doing now that
01:25:36 he's fired from the yeah oh god he's you know you know what guys i had an update on that i heard
01:25:42 that that was actually semi-fake news uh because i think like that guy came out and said something
01:25:49 that he heard from an editorial staff or whatever that like up who was out i heard later on like
01:25:54 an actual executive of the company say that like the person who did it um was not speaking on behalf
01:25:59 of the studio and that uh to not take the serious probably because they've watched that episode of
01:26:04 brain dump and they're like oh god we're retarded we're taking it back hopefully i mean hopefully
01:26:08 but i heard that that's actually not true but i mean i don't watch the simpson so i guess i don't
01:26:13 really have the up-to-date info because i don't pay attention you know the worst thing they did
01:26:17 and this is my only opinion on this controversy but the worst thing was when they like sort of like
01:26:22 tried to address it in the show but in like the most heavy-handed asinine way they could have
01:26:28 or like they just had marge and lisa like break character and look at the screen like and look
01:26:34 and just say like oh here is fucking some things will be addressed in time maybe or if at all
01:26:40 and they like then there's like a picture a framed picture of a poo like on lisa's like what it may
01:26:46 here's the thing like either either say fuck you to the critics or say okay we're sorry you
01:26:52 win to the critics but like it was this weird like middle ground like i don't care if you
01:26:56 count out of them or not just do like why address it at all if you're gonna do it in this
01:27:01 wishy washy basically saying nothing way it was weird yeah it was it was just really like
01:27:07 off-putting and slimy feeling the way that like they looked at the camera and said hey we know that
01:27:12 some guy doesn't like that this like stop don't ever do that yeah you know they were literally
01:27:17 addressing it but in not a satisfying way for anybody and if like like the south park guys if
01:27:22 they heard this they would literally make an episode saying fuck you and just fill it with
01:27:26 indian stereotypes and just like completely well they did they did an episode about the
01:27:30 approved thing recently it was the it was this is about mr hanky like tweeting things on ambian
01:27:35 like rosanne the episode was called the trouble with a poo oh shit and at the end of the episode
01:27:42 mr hanky gets run out of town and has to move to springfield and a poo is there and that's
01:27:48 and then and then i go oh that was a that was a chuckle good job boys like at least they're
01:27:53 they're have courage of their convictions whether or not you agree with them or not it's kind of like
01:27:57 um it's just respect it's like an honorable opponent even if you're like a far left wing at
01:28:03 least you're like well these guys are making their opinions clear they say fuck you uh or so i don't
01:28:08 maybe they're actually more sympathetic have not seen the episode but i'm assuming you walk into
01:28:13 an immigrant internment camp this guy slaps your girlfriend on the ass what do you do
01:28:17 you um slap some fucking gas chambers on him that's what i do look at it look at his eyes
01:28:26 they aren't looking at you they aren't looking at anything they don't have no they're looking at
01:28:32 everything it's contemplating the universe right now you just told me that's a fourth
01:28:37 dimensional consciousness i would like the simpsons to slowly kill off every character until there's
01:28:44 only like two left and becomes a totally different show oh my god what if they did an episode about
01:28:49 like infant death and fucking mag he dies whoa just make it happen just make it happen and in the
01:28:56 next episode she's fine again no they never mentioned it like when brian died on family guy
01:29:03 uh guys should we go to the questions i think i think i think right at the end done enough for
01:29:08 these freaks right on this baby death question let's do an elegant transition um here we go
01:29:16 all right question here it is oh wait i gotta go to the right fucking channel so i don't feel the
01:29:21 thing uh so it's our friend one spar who seems to always be the last guy who i don't choose one
01:29:26 spar first on purpose he like always seems to be the guy who left the most recent comment
01:29:31 when i record which i think he does on purpose because he's smart he knows that like if he doesn't
01:29:36 right before the episode starts that's when i do them or maybe he's just lazy i don't know that
01:29:40 could be a tomb um anyway let's see what he's got to say today it's called one spar woke up late go
01:29:48 autonomous is an awkward thing to say
01:29:53 other than that it's an amazing game oh to whose game having a lot of fun with it everyone should
01:29:59 play it right now go download it that's it cool all right i left that in to remind to remind me
01:30:09 to to be like davoo's games out guys davoo's game is out at the moment that's cool i don't think okay
01:30:15 i don't think any of us have played it but not because i didn't want to i tried to play it last
01:30:19 night but the download was gone so i didn't have the ability to play it i was busy it's not on itch
01:30:24 anymore uh wherever on the website it was there'll be a link in the description i don't
01:30:31 uh there was no download like when i looked or something it said on the website it's down
01:30:35 because you had to fix something or something i played it but it's there now oh shit excellent
01:30:41 perfect i wanted to hear from you uh yes davoo's game at tominous uh what do you think sorry i'm a
01:30:49 little out of breath he ran he heard the call now i'm a little out of breath because i was just
01:30:56 like burning some ica furniture but it had like weird chemicals in it and i couldn't breathe and
01:31:00 it was terrible uh but oh that's cool you know how it goes with burning things yeah um all right
01:31:06 burning down the neighborhood in this tough economy uh so autonomous is a very it's a very
01:31:14 davoo game here's my game review uh it's it's it's good and it's short and it's very davoo it's
01:31:21 it's a game about clicking on pieces of furniture in a house and reading the flavor text um and it's
01:31:29 like that very much sounds cool yeah it's like you do that in every single video game ever but
01:31:34 nobody not not not a single time is it actually supposed to be funny except sometimes like sometimes
01:31:40 when it's a comedy based game like they put a bit of comedy in there but like imagine davoo
01:31:45 being funny but like with every item in an entire house like the the the amount of things that you
01:31:50 know there's just a lot of funny stuff in there and it's really cute and really tight i i didn't
01:31:55 have any problems with like it crashing uh and i downloaded the original version so i don't know
01:32:01 what's up with that even davoo is confused um but it's the music also it basically you know how
01:32:09 like last time i was talking about how delta rune is like i don't really care about like the meta
01:32:14 stuff in undertale delta rune is just scratches an itch that doesn't get scratched generally
01:32:19 of like nice characters and quirky setting with like you know easy enough gameplay and this is
01:32:25 basically davoo's like was it an attempt to do that he didn't know delta room was coming out
01:32:30 obviously none of us did and so his like game uh coming out was like uh unfortunate but it is
01:32:36 it is the same sort of delta rune scratching sort of you know not like a huge game like an hour
01:32:42 two hours but it's it's very much in that same vein of like quirky fun and simple and it's great
01:32:50 and i really like it and it's a really good job dude i think it's really cool i'm actually super
01:32:53 fucking excited to go play i think i wish i had a chance to before the episode but i'm definitely
01:32:57 gonna do it right after it's really cool that some of us are like making games like a bunch of us are
01:33:02 making games and yeah like i anything that's not a youtube video because i'm like so over
01:33:08 like youtube videos in and of themselves as a thing yeah yeah like people who fucking make
01:33:12 games and draw and shit that's cool man it's cool i want to do cool stuff like that and speaking of
01:33:18 drawing let's talk about here's a topic let's talk about my sweet new drawing tablet yeah courtesy
01:33:24 of tom oliver courtesy of tom oliver he sent me this because i was fucking uh complaining about
01:33:29 not being able to draw and now i can draw and i've been drawing how many masterpieces to share with
01:33:34 us um love to see one i do i mean should we show them in this episode or like a draw cast because
01:33:39 i don't know we if you want we could certainly put some in the show and draw cast or a specific
01:33:43 thing if yeah we'll look at the show notes if you want to yeah if you want to go out i don't know
01:33:47 what i'm gonna do with these yet if i'm gonna like make a place to upload them all or something or
01:33:52 like uh i don't know because i thought it'd be cool to have like a webcomic or something and i've
01:33:57 mostly been drawn like weird like weird monsters and like weird self portraits of me being fat on
01:34:02 the beach and stuff with like uh i mean there's always handy stuff just to host them yeah i do have
01:34:08 an old devian art page that they have an upload i'm working on a batman comic right now like a
01:34:13 like a big like a long i don't know maybe three pages okay like a batman comic and it's it's called
01:34:20 the joker rapes at midnight the plot it sounds good the plot of it is that the joker you know he
01:34:31 hijacks the news feed or whatever he makes an ultimatum he says tonight i'm either going to rape
01:34:38 1000 babies or i'm gonna rape batman so if batman cares about this city he will offer his ass to me
01:34:49 and that's the the dilemma that batman has to is one man's pride worth a thousand babies virginities
01:34:56 we're gonna find out in the joker rapes at midnight well that sounds fascinating just jesse is this
01:35:02 gonna be the beginning of of a revival of double batman and triple joker yes oh yeah we're gonna
01:35:08 get some real shit now that would be glorious it would be glorious and then i yeah i was thinking
01:35:14 like man if i really like just started drawing batman comics like i wonder what i could legally
01:35:20 do with them like could i publish them in something if they were like technically a parody because
01:35:25 like i'm not sure yeah i don't know you just just change a letter only one way to find out dude
01:35:30 yeah because that would be awesome to like release a book of like com like a fucking comic book that
01:35:35 would be the coolest shit ever that would be fucking dope well fucking fantastic i can't wait
01:35:41 to see it uh i guess let's go to the next question here uh this is one from a fan of the show never
01:35:47 paint friend draw reliable draw guy draws all kinds of cool stuff check him out uh let's see what he has to say
01:35:56 pcp dating sim is a really good project i'm designing detailed background art right now
01:36:01 painting the sacred halls of a pcp university campus it's really fun my question what would
01:36:09 be your perfect dating location doesn't need to have any ties to reality answers are appreciated oh man
01:36:19 my ideal dating location would be on the set of joker rapes at midnight
01:36:28 so so never paint here is advertising the pcp dating sim shit what was the twitter link for that
01:36:34 i think was pcp dating at pcp dating i'm gonna go double check but so apparently it's real people
01:36:38 are working on it confirmed by never paint here yeah at pcp dating that's the one i'm not sure i
01:36:43 like that that at like that the handle like that could be misconstrued great pcp yeah like literally
01:36:50 date us go to pcp dating where we need girlfriends please sign up if you're a girlfriend nothing
01:36:56 that says pcp in the title is ever going to be good i've been saying this for fucking five years
01:37:03 sure sure um but hey it's already happening and we can't stop my ideal dating scenario would be a
01:37:09 national land or a sort of government building maybe a statue moments before a terrorist attack
01:37:15 so when we start to get in the mood and maybe we kiss for the first time the bombs start to drop
01:37:21 that sounds good i maybe you could time your orgasm with instant death that'd be ideal whoa
01:37:25 whoa that's a step that's a step too far that i would say nothing about orgasm okay you're right
01:37:30 you're right i'm getting carried away here forgive me uh my ideal on my wedding night i
01:37:35 want a 9-11 to happen at the moment of climax that would be ideal uh my ideal dating scenario
01:37:40 would be like a proper lap like an actual lap like not like dungeons and dragons would like uh-huh i
01:37:46 got you with lightning ball like you get like a real like suit of armor you get your your real
01:37:50 like torches with the flames on them and you're like oh yes i'm i'm staying in character for a
01:37:55 whole month and i'm out here in the fields like i got a real tent and i'm like that that that would
01:38:00 be the real shit and you got like i mean you got the phone swords because you don't want to kill
01:38:03 anyone but you got a real sword that is for show and you're like oh yes it's real sharp guys
01:38:09 that's that and then okay that'll be that that's the one my my ideal one would be is basically imagine
01:38:16 like a pretty nature scene with like a river and forest and stuff like that except everything is
01:38:21 pastel purple and sparkly sounds good of course of course mine would be like it's like a like a
01:38:28 beautiful like a like a scottish glen like like the highlands or everything's green and it's like
01:38:34 overlooking cliffs and stuff and it's all beautiful and serene but also you can see planets in the
01:38:40 sky so you know that you're not on earth and oh yeah and also there's like a maybe like a dinosaur
01:38:46 somewhere and like a big fucking another dinosaur what if you're both riding dinosaurs yeah oh that
01:38:56 would be nice the dinosaurs um some of them have saddles because it's we've tamed them
01:39:01 in this society on this planet that i've invented just now have you tamed them or they tamed you
01:39:06 that's the question um i think it's a uh it's like a uh a symbiotic relationship i think we've tamed
01:39:12 each other we bring out the best in each other man and dinosaurs i don't know why i said lark for
01:39:18 some reason like like it was it was said you could be like random like uh not real places could be
01:39:23 i would be like the the scene from game of thrones where john gets stabbed i want to reenact
01:39:27 that who is john who's john that's you in this situation that's the question that's the eternal
01:39:32 question they'll have to figure that out i don't know i'm thinking i guess just on the on the on the
01:39:41 bow of a spaceship hurtling off toward adventure uh to to parts unknown to discover the wonders of
01:39:46 the universe uh i mean pretty simple but yeah that's literally what i want to be doing with
01:39:52 life oh that's a good answer secrets i'm gonna change my answer to that in fact oh everyone in space
01:39:59 my okay i i want to change my my dream date scenario would be we're getting home you know we're
01:40:04 you know maybe maybe we're getting a little bit frisky you and me on name player you know maybe we're
01:40:08 getting we're getting the mood then we turn the corner and and and and then before we can even
01:40:14 register total shock fills our body and then solider creek says what are you doing in this
01:40:19 video and instead of having sexual relations like how we thought we actually have to pretend
01:40:27 that we're reviewing a movie oh shit oh shit yeah yeah yeah i would be like in an angry video game
01:40:33 nerd episode i've changed mine as well i'm gonna be in the video game den i'm gonna point out like
01:40:37 let's play this game nerd and he's like okay he's just sort of there for some reason on the date
01:40:42 i'm sure ben ben would be uh uh at the fanciest of restaurants out back by the dumpster overflowing
01:40:50 with leftovers and ingredients it's just it's a it's a smorgasbord out there
01:40:54 with the fun oh literally lady in the tramp situation literally lady in the tramp that's
01:40:59 actually romantic so you know what that totally works yeah and then i'd be like i'd be like on a
01:41:04 beach like a tropical hawaiian beach where all the girls are like beautiful and there's only girls
01:41:08 and there's no other boys but me but but like also it's not just a beach it's also it's also in
01:41:15 like a plastic dome in space and so it's like a it's like a space station of domes with different
01:41:21 ecosystems in them and so you can you can go in the tubes like hamster tubes from one to the other
01:41:26 to get from the beach to the skiing slope and stuff and also there's like like little graves
01:41:32 on the beach because there was like a normandy situation at some point so there's little like
01:41:36 little white crosses all along the shoreline that does sound good that does sound good oh you
01:41:40 could also go for some like end of eva imagery with those crosses out in the distance oh yeah there's
01:41:45 also an avangelion beach but that's different from the tropical beach there's many domes there's
01:41:49 many domes in my space station many domes that's the name of my book i just want a cyberpunk future
01:41:58 where i have like robot prosthetics i live forever and i have a robot dong that can be as big as
01:42:04 it needs to be because that's that's a little point of cybernetics anyways right i want tom
01:42:09 sexing to be like you know those extremely overly animated like robo combination animations they do
01:42:15 in the old super robot animations uh it'd be that only robo pop with robo vagina and just like like
01:42:22 animated animated 24 fps on ones like overly detailed flying yeah tom's date area should be uh you
01:42:32 show up to the pre uh you know determined meeting place you know maybe like a fancy restaurant or
01:42:36 something and then you're like where's tom then it cuts back to him debugging his game looking at the
01:42:41 time and like oh well i fucked up i mean going back oh just like just like flubber with robo with uh
01:42:46 you know he was always late and forgot dates and stuff because he actually doesn't give a
01:42:50 shit even though he says it's because he's quote unquote so in love yeah that makes sense i don't
01:42:55 buy it you're a bad husband or whatever uh all right well that's everybody let's go to the next
01:43:00 question um next is from this is from hippo shit hippo shit oh no let's let's see what he has
01:43:08 hello friends if uh if uh our lovely uh dearly friendly neighborhood hypocrite is looking for
01:43:15 a new show to watch uh then perhaps you should check out hilda on netflix as it is similar to the
01:43:22 steven universe uh a pantheon of cartoons you see so he might enjoy it and it also is all out at
01:43:30 once so it's the opposite of steven universe yeah i can't tell i can't tell if he's doing a cool
01:43:36 voice or if he's just cool yeah what do they say hilda hilda yeah i heard good things about it so
01:43:46 people and it's all out which is great it to me i'll i'll i'll give it a gander i'll give it a
01:43:51 little pain you know i watched some of uh over the garden wall uh which was that over that garden wall
01:43:57 i look pretty i never i don't know it's a great finish it yeah it was really good
01:44:01 dude i just watched the fucking season two of the castlevania show it was
01:44:07 i'm watching it please don't spoil okay i won't spoil it but like i couldn't believe how good it
01:44:12 was because i didn't really watch season one i i sort of like skimmed through like the first
01:44:17 episode and i saw like the a la carte episode where he's introduced but that's really like
01:44:20 all i saw of it so i just kind of jumped into season two without fucking knowing anything
01:44:25 and like it was like such a ride it was so like good like there was so much character like even
01:44:31 everyone had like a backstory and a personality like even even like the underlings of like the bad
01:44:38 guys had like their own little like arcs and stuff there was like a whole pretty dope like half the
01:44:44 series was like a la carte and fucking what's his face and the lady girl trevor and cypher trevor
01:44:50 come on hang it cool look man i'm i'm uh old i don't remember names of characters and shows
01:44:56 anymore that's like a dad thing so i just like say like the fat one as so like so like half of it
01:45:01 was them in a in a library like talking and like jiffing and jiving with each other and like you
01:45:07 know well you're a jerk well you're my friend too buddy and so the but then the other half was like
01:45:12 in in draculous camp and all of his like underlings and all of his spooky friends and they're all
01:45:17 like bickering amongst themselves and they're all like plotting and scheming under each other and
01:45:21 like backstabbing each other and i'm like this is just this is just a good fucking time that sounds
01:45:26 like it sounds like um like orcs from mode of the rings sort of yeah yeah yeah that's cool
01:45:34 oh right there's another show that i watched uh just last night because i was at a person's house
01:45:39 and everyone fell asleep and i'm always the last one to fall asleep so there was a tv in front of me
01:45:44 so i ended up watching this show that i never heard of called Norseman
01:45:48 and it's like uh it's like a scandinavian horseman hey it's like a scandinavian show and it's like
01:45:55 like like sort of like a game of thrones or a vikings type show like you think it's like that
01:45:59 but it's a comedy and it's like it's like it's sort of like flight of the concords but vikings
01:46:05 oh shit and like that sounds great yeah the tone of it was like that really like awkward like
01:46:08 everyone's kind of a doof comedy but like it had like a really cool balance of tone where like
01:46:14 it's really really funny and silly and absurd but also when they start killing people it is like
01:46:21 it's done like straight like a real like vikings are killing people and it's scary
01:46:25 kind of show it's like it was a really well done i liked it and i watched like the whole
01:46:30 first season in bed and it was a good time it reminds me a little bit of uh this manga
01:46:35 vinland saga that i think is getting an anime i'm pretty sure um and uh i don't know yeah it mostly
01:46:41 was serious viking stuff which was really great and i loved it but then there was some humor so
01:46:45 whatever it was good it was good all right uh all right let's go to the next question this is from
01:46:50 nibbo the hoe or is it nibbo the hoe oh my god that's the emissary of education a concert it is
01:46:56 we're welcome please educate us this one goes out to nate and digipro uh you guys are the only
01:47:05 two people that have ever thought about what would it be like to be your kid or what would it be like
01:47:12 to have you as my dad and for nate i think um it's just he'd be a quirky guy quirky dad but
01:47:20 but overall really good except for that he gives way too many lectures and for digipro um well god
01:47:31 he's just gonna be shit dad he's gonna he's gonna have his kids doing things they don't want to do
01:47:40 from from his from his happiness projection he's gonna be wrong and he's gonna tell them wrong
01:47:47 things uh that's my prediction it's truth they'll have no one to tell them that their dad is wrong
01:47:56 talk to my dad's shit cut this out you're damn right i included that because you aren't here to
01:48:02 defend yourself digi ha ha take that i like the idea of i i just like the image of instead of like a
01:48:08 dad forcing his kids to play sports he's forcing them to make youtube vlogs and review anime and
01:48:14 shit like daddy i want to know where 3.0 is coming it's coming we have to be on the cutting edge of it
01:48:21 dad you've been saying that for the past 19 years my existence no no it's coming i want to run around
01:48:28 outside and look at bunnies yeah they're just gonna have to tell them what you think about what to do
01:48:34 with it it's gonna be whatever you can see you can see rabbits on google image search a little
01:48:39 bastard so so dad i started reading some history books and i started you know researching some
01:48:44 math textbooks what do you think what's the point of being we're being smart why aren't you fucking
01:48:49 what's the point of being right how are you with me son are you with me i feel like digi's son or
01:48:57 daughter is going to become a doctor just to spite him get the most education possible it's
01:49:04 usually how it works like like fuck you dad i'll be exactly the opposite oh my god can you can you
01:49:09 imagine the the fucking just like like like screw you it would get if digi has a son or a daughter
01:49:16 and they are determined to go to college and he has to co-sign on those loans and pay back all that
01:49:21 money oh my god i want to have a kid now this has to happen okay imagine like nate you want to be a
01:49:30 father too and i have ingredients of the same thing but this is not the way like this is not
01:49:35 munchy and nate best man are going to have children you know this is gonna be pretty far in the future
01:49:41 not like you know like a billion years or anything but this isn't like i would say that i mean i mean
01:49:45 me i'm just gonna refer to you because it would be it's weird to refer to myself you know you're
01:49:49 gonna have like a you know like a few fucking years like you know probably i mean i want to be
01:49:54 probably five or something you're probably gonna change a whole bunch in that time but digi wants
01:49:58 to have a child like now and it will be digi bro having the child it will not be digi man well
01:50:05 the youtuber man digi bro in his current state of not being able to like wake up in the morning
01:50:12 and drinking constantly that would be a father for an actual human being it's gonna be the future
01:50:17 vlogs it's just gonna have like a like the reflective glasses gonna have a baby in one
01:50:21 corner and then and then maze button the other at all times and he'll make that his icon
01:50:30 oh that would be pretty fun that would be pretty fucking sick thoroughly roasted digi show up next
01:50:35 time to defend yourself that's all i have to say all right uh what do we got next a feast for hands
01:50:41 a feast for hands h and d s uh tell us your thoughts hello i believe i can be a broker
01:50:51 between the two parties of this pcp union you have here see for for star fleets to truly
01:50:59 come into into fomention i don't think it is to be created the the power with of dreams
01:51:07 have to be harnessed as the fuel source of this new advanced society
01:51:12 thus the violet nathans will rise as a new fusion from the tarah hearings yes just like the
01:51:22 animes that are watched what a worthwhile comment the violet nathans the violet nathans um well i did
01:51:32 choose to play that so i guess i'm the one at fault um what the fuck get moving on decimated i apologize
01:51:40 uh uh uh jevil man this is from jevil man um deltarune character yeah he guys deltarune
01:51:50 alternative theorist here i just wanted to point out that when you you guys said that
01:51:55 when during the asriel potential reveal that you know susie didn't really react but if you look at
01:52:01 her sprite she's all hunched back you know she's got her arms all twisted up like she's nervous and
01:52:07 her eyes are bigger than bowling balls so i think you guys need to really reanalyze the scene if you

01:53:10 okay next next comment do it i dare you uh what do you do friend
01:53:16 you know on this day of which i am delivering pizzas as i currently do that i wondered i pondered
01:53:26 i thought the most important of questions does pcp sled gang do they stand atop the white
01:53:38 sled and conquer the mountains with a plastic is an agarral and foam foam
01:53:44 match to carry i know one to three humans do they talk about a sled i think that's a pcp sled gang
01:53:53 this is what we need to know i think he's currently sledding like in the episode i think he was
01:54:00 well maybe i thought he was talking about delivering if you deliver pizzas on a sled that's
01:54:05 pretty funny that's pretty big the pizza shops at the top of the mountain and he has to that's
01:54:11 the fast sleds down to any individual house um make sense we that was like a fucking
01:54:17 yeah that guy i don't know that was just that was like a oh chilling and killing my sweet anabelle
01:54:25 on the cliffs over the sea i think what he was getting at is we should make a jamaican
01:54:30 bobsled team he's right uh oh can i be the sled dude plenty big enough yeah that's true
01:54:40 um i'm more interested in everyone's fucking voices than their actual questions i don't even
01:54:45 know the questions are i always like to include the the diversity of voices here it's nice it
01:54:50 adds a lot of depth to the episode let's see what number eight hideyasu has for us you guys tend to
01:54:59 refer to the pcp as a sort of friendship simulator yeah i completely agree because anyone who's willing
01:55:04 to listen to this dumpster fiverr podcast clearly has some issues to sort out myself included my
01:55:09 problem with this is that i have yet to find anybody who has the same interests and works on the same
01:55:13 wavelength that i do so while this may be a friendship simulator it's not like i have many
01:55:17 other options available to me i like the few friends that i do have but frankly they don't have much
01:55:22 to offer besides the fact that they're just fun to hang out with they're not the type of people who
01:55:25 are going to give me advice and help me with my goals etc etc and they're not willing to listen
01:55:30 to my advice how can i find friends to have more intelligent and meaningful discussion
01:55:34 so that i can finally quit listening to this podcast and do something more valuable sometimes
01:55:39 yeah okay i think just find people however it however difficult that may be find people who
01:55:45 are like into the most obscure shit that you're also into because they'll probably be on a deeper
01:55:50 wavelength yeah that's probably true uh i mean question look look into yourself and ask yourself
01:55:57 how many people do you actually meet day to day because they have numbers probably quite low
01:56:02 so you're probably not exposing yourself to a lot of people which is understandable if you're young
01:56:06 and stuff uh joint clubs uh hang out on forums with like-minded people and uh you just meet
01:56:12 more people because you'll meet a lot of shitty people who don't you don't care about and they
01:56:15 don't aren't cool but that will expose you to an opportunity to meet more good people i guess so
01:56:21 yeah do most of the people who are like what like no one relates to me like like there's no one that
01:56:27 is on the same like unbelievably genius wavelength that i am there's no one that knows the real deep
01:56:33 shit they're like you know the truly obscure stuff like 4chan.net like no one understands like i do
01:56:39 yeah uh most of the time they just are in their room and don't even make an attempt to fucking
01:56:45 actually meet people and you expect to bump into your best friend at the supermarket whenever you
01:56:50 do are forced to leave your room i'm not saying that's what you are i'm just saying you like
01:56:58 i think everyone everyone in the world who has the sentiment overestimates how hard it is to
01:57:04 meet like-minded people because there aren't like you okay i don't mean this like a derogatory way
01:57:11 but you aren't that special dude you aren't that fucking crazy or that obscure or that insane
01:57:18 that no one's going to be able to get what you're putting down unless you're talking to people who
01:57:22 legitimately just don't get it which i'm sure is the vast majority people but i'm saying not that
01:57:28 fucking hard go on a forum find your what are your interests go to a forum oh but i don't want to go
01:57:34 on a forum because that's fucking gay okay you aren't making an attempt to find new people you
01:57:40 you don't want to go out to a club because oh they wouldn't get it anyway like you want to go out to
01:57:43 your fucking college club you want to go out to any you know flyers down the street or whatever
01:57:47 you're not making the attempt if you don't do that then you can't fucking say that you're trying
01:57:51 your best to make friends because what are you doing you're saying that you can't make friends and
01:57:56 then stay in the house making a self-fulfilling prophecy if you want to have people relate to
01:58:01 you fucking try at all and you will find people very soon i don't think that uh this podcast
01:58:09 or any podcast should be used as a replacement for like actual relationships and actual friends
01:58:15 and it sounds like this guy like has friends he just feels like he's not getting like
01:58:19 deep conversations out of them or like talking about the real shit but i think this is what might
01:58:24 be one of the situations where the best the most valuable thing you can do is nothing because i think
01:58:30 that like being like having all the same interests and having like big deep like conversations is
01:58:37 overrated and what really matters is just being with your friends at all and even doing nothing
01:58:43 like you'll regret not taking every opportunity to just be around the people who like you regardless
01:58:48 of whether you're fucking talking about fucking issues or whatever you know completely agree with
01:58:54 you jesse just in human interaction all with your friends is good i would even say if you aren't
01:59:00 getting like the deep conversations you want maybe you can instigate that i mean i mean don't just
01:59:05 wait for it to happen just don't wait for your friends to bring up things that are you know heavy
01:59:09 hitting if you want to do that and it's not weird and obviously you're talking about spider man talking
01:59:14 about you know oh man spider home home come so good don't bring out how your father's dead and
01:59:19 your and your dog shot himself just if the mood's right try and do that yourself like bring up the
01:59:25 things that interest you because guaranteed if your friends aren't shitters then they'll care about you
01:59:31 and they'll want to hear what's on your mind i don't think he he said something in there um
01:59:36 he said something about his friends not being willing to listen to his advice so i get that this
01:59:40 guy wants to think about like making it and probably like making progress and growing and
01:59:45 developing as a person and he wants people that share that interest it's possible that you're an
01:59:50 asshole and you're not that smart or interesting that's definitely possible and that's why they're
01:59:54 not listening but it's also part that they legitimately don't share your interest which is
01:59:59 fine like you know like sure if they're your friends you can enjoy hanging out with them but
02:00:03 if you really just don't have friends that you connect with yes you've you've got to go find the
02:00:09 people i guess or at the very least challenge the people that are your current friends in in new
02:00:14 ways try to get them involved in things maybe see if they take because i mean i had lots of friends
02:00:18 in in college that like i would try to do stuff i mean i was not like a productive god but i'd try
02:00:24 to do some things some people were interested some people weren't i mean okay so now you know
02:00:28 which people you're more interested in hanging around with and like people who like contribute
02:00:31 to what you're trying to do uh you can hang out with them more and people who don't like it's fine
02:00:35 it's not a judgment you know just hang out with the people who do what you want to do more uh and
02:00:40 and most importantly yeah i say make new friends go out do things put yourself in situations where
02:00:46 you meet people because if you're just home be in sad you've got a zero percent chance of meeting
02:00:50 people that you like hanging out with if you do anything at all go out um join clubs join forums
02:00:56 talk to people uh maybe go to like meetup.com or something like try to find places where like-minded
02:01:01 people are gathering it's easier than ever to find people of common interest to you it's literally
02:01:06 clicks away clicks away also i don't think that you should um expect or desire to have your advice
02:01:14 listened to by your friends or anyone advice is like the worst like you don't want to be the guy
02:01:20 who gives advice because nobody wants advice ever advice is totally worthless because no matter
02:01:27 how much you think that your outside perspective will help you don't know the person you're not in
02:01:32 their brain you don't know every facet of it so they're gonna hear your advice and go you
02:01:35 fucking idiot you don't know it's not that fucking simple like that's true nobody ever wants to hear
02:01:40 advice all anyone wants to hear if they're like having a hard time and they're like confiding in
02:01:44 you or coming to you all they want is to be listened to and be heard they don't necessarily
02:01:49 want you to like throw oh well you should do this at them because nobody wants that
02:01:53 shit it's obnoxious the the pcp has always been like a like a like a uh a voice for kind of niche
02:02:03 and an off-color opinion that's always been this case and i realized that i just gave the advice
02:02:07 not to give advice i realized the contradiction don't try to call me out on it i'm fucking self-aware
02:02:13 a lot of people who watch the piece a lot of fans of the pcp have been genuinely like
02:02:18 indoctrinated in a way to firmly believe all like the the foundational beliefs of the pcp
02:02:25 a lot of that i don't even believe that growing up on starfleet and shit like that which and and so
02:02:30 i just want to say for the record well of course having people who you know are our goal-oriented
02:02:36 people who are doing their shift obviously this is beneficial we've talked about this for a
02:02:41 fucking a billion episodes at this point you know what we hold to be true and what we what we expect
02:02:48 and what we like as a as a consciousness here but it is not to diminish the fact that it is
02:02:56 extremely valuable to have friends who are just funny or kind yeah being a kind person who is
02:03:05 nice and generous or would give you the clothes you know clothes off their back if you need them
02:03:10 that is an extremely valuable type of person to have because they're fucking nice kindness is not
02:03:16 often regarded here in these circles which is not like a bad thing we're talking about other things
02:03:21 but kind of trumps everything those things are good and listen to your friends and just don't
02:03:25 expect them to be like the pcp appreciate them for what they are and that's probably nice people yeah
02:03:32 you kind of want to have the people like that around you for sure because like the problem with
02:03:36 having nothing but creative people around you is like especially like people like like for
02:03:41 myself for like artistically obsessed with their work is that their work is always going to come
02:03:46 first and like that's going to be their number one concern and so if soup comes to nuts they're
02:03:50 going to fucking abandon you to work on their shit if you have friends you need a mixture of people
02:03:55 who are creative who will help inspire you if you have those kind of aspirations but you also need
02:04:00 people who are just like friendly that you can just like when you need to take a break you have
02:04:04 somebody who like isn't going to in the back of their mind like you like i got to get back to work
02:04:08 eventually like this is the work the work is being social and having a good time because that's
02:04:12 what they want to do in their lives part of that will rub off on you and you will stop being so
02:04:16 artistically obsessed with your work and you can find that balance that you might not naturally have
02:04:20 one of my best friends in real life has no aspirations other than playing video games and
02:04:24 doing his job and for some reason like when i hang out with him it just clicks like we hang out
02:04:29 once in a blue moon because he's like living his real life he's like a therapist he like went to
02:04:32 like real school and shit um but like absolutely we grew up as kids like pretty close by we just
02:04:37 went to the game shop store and played cards and shit and like when we hang out it's just that
02:04:42 again and all of my cares go away and i'm just hanging out with my friend that i've known for
02:04:46 like 15 years i'm not thinking about art just thinking about playing games having a good time
02:04:50 and like i'm very rarely in that headspace and it's super healthy and i wish he was closer so we
02:04:54 could do it more often because it is good to have that back i absolutely man i know the exact
02:04:59 feel i just last night went and saw one like my best friend from high school who i never see anymore
02:05:04 like the first time i've seen him in like a year and a half maybe and like what you said it was just
02:05:09 this like feeling of like oh i'm like out of it for one night i'm out of the internet i'm out of
02:05:15 my fucking room i'm out of this creative shit i'm just with a person who is my friend and who
02:05:20 was kind and we like each other and we can fucking get drunk and like fucking hug each other and be
02:05:25 like oh i fucking love you and i miss you you fucking bastard it's the most important thing
02:05:29 in the world like kindness trumps everything fuck anyone who is creative fuck anyone who thinks that
02:05:37 they're smarter than you or who has an attitude or who is arrogant or who is like a just like an
02:05:43 asshole fuck anyone who has like delusions of grandeur none of it is all bullshit like kindness
02:05:48 is the ultimate human trait it's the only thing you need just like don't fucking expect things out
02:05:53 of your friends except for kindness that's the only thing that matters just be with them and
02:05:58 fucking fucking watch football or some gay shit i have a venn diagram i have a venn diagram in my
02:06:06 head of of people who are useful to me and then people who are my friends these are separate
02:06:12 categories but there is a overlap between i like yes a venn diagram exactly yeah i i get what you're
02:06:18 what you're laying down i'm on it i'm in it and and oh and final point wait sorry i just i was
02:06:25 going to say the only the only thing i wanted to make about this whole friendship thing is uh
02:06:29 it's possible you're underestimating your friends so i'm just going to say don't forget that you do
02:06:33 need to cultivate friendships to get more kind of out of them so don't expect you just meet someone
02:06:38 and they're an npc and you can immediately exhaust all their dialogue and ideas so you know just be
02:06:43 aware that friendships need to grow before people will share some things with you or their stuff so
02:06:47 it's possible you just met these quote-unquote friends that you described like yesterday and
02:06:52 so it's natural for them to not you know be be sharing everything they got so i'm just saying
02:06:56 don't underestimate them don't assume they got nothing going on and ancillary ancillary to like
02:07:00 all of this advice like this is secondary not not as important but um the the there's one like
02:07:11 pretty it's not easy but like a simple way to like attract people that you like more or are like
02:07:18 minded is is just to be a better version of yourself like to be the coolest guy in the room so like
02:07:24 maybe work on improving how cool you are and how charismatic you are and how much uh you know how
02:07:31 much how many people gravitate towards you it would just make it easier than you being kind of lame
02:07:36 and having to go up to everyone very true that's very true you know i i always think of something
02:07:42 that like um people like what what we were saying before about like people being sort of indoctrinated
02:07:49 into like pcp like stuff that we've said like not everything that we've said as is like meant to be
02:07:56 taken totally seriously like this has always been kind of a comedy podcast like there's i know there's
02:08:02 stuff that i've said especially in early episodes of this podcast that i would like probably vehemently
02:08:07 disagree with now or that i have like totally the opposite stance on like sometimes i've had people
02:08:13 like it's the worst when someone agrees with something that you said years ago that you no
02:08:17 longer fucking yeah even remember you said let alone agree with like i've had people going like
02:08:22 oh man like remember what jesse said sometimes about how like uh people who aren't creative
02:08:28 aren't real people i totally agree with that and it's like no don't agree with that's the worst
02:08:33 thing i've ever said that's the most evil thing that's ever come out of my mouth except for what i
02:08:38 said to the carny lady when i was kid that was totally different i i've had numerous experiences
02:08:44 very recently when fans would come up to me like say like and like say like one like post like i'm
02:08:49 sorry like i'm so sorry i'm so sorry like i know that you're so fucking busy right now and i shouldn't
02:08:53 be messing with you at all like like i like i understand that i'm a fan but um and then they
02:08:56 go on to like they're like really well thought out and like cool like yeah i get that too like i
02:09:01 get comments where it's like oh man i hope jesse doesn't ban me for this but i really like this
02:09:06 video and i like it dear god i i'm sorry i'm sorry for banning anyone ever yeah i i i just want
02:09:16 everyone to know that i i do not hate fans i i've never even been the one to say that just
02:09:22 in the pcp and people think that's what they think no you can talk to me whatever you want it's
02:09:28 literally i love talking to people on my discord on twitter like that's the interaction's great
02:09:33 because yeah if you're nice to me then i like you that's it i prefer to interact with people like i
02:09:40 either over twitter dms or in groups on discord i don't like people PMing me or DMing me on discord
02:09:46 out of nowhere that's kind of scary i don't know how i'm down i'm down with that i don't care it's
02:09:51 cool if you got stuff you want to say to me you know questions or whatever just something that you
02:09:56 thought i'd be interested in or i don't know whatever my my discord's fucking public use just
02:10:01 like my ex wife sure showed her i think literally all of us have like a private discord or not a
02:10:09 private but like a specific to us discord yeah and i'm like i'm i get along with all the people in
02:10:15 there they have yeah all the people in my discord are cool shit they're they're fucking cool shoutouts
02:10:19 to everybody in there call call into the pcp call into the pcp you have good voices you have funny
02:10:26 voices i really feel like what that what that kid was saying um in that voicemail about like feeling
02:10:32 like his friends aren't like stimulating him intellectually like he wants because like i feel
02:10:36 like i used to be kind of in the same place where like i got in a mode for a couple years where i was
02:10:40 like man i i don't have anything in common with my friends anymore i have more in common with my
02:10:45 creative friends on the internet but like like a couple years after that like that was just like a
02:10:49 phase for like a couple years and then like after that like i'm back to now i think that all creative
02:10:54 people are fucking evil narcissists and sociopaths who should fucking bleed out and die in the street
02:11:00 and like regular people who just work regular jobs and like are cool on the weekends those are my
02:11:05 people that's who i want to be around now so i've totally i've totally flipped the pig on that one
02:11:10 i've totally flipped kill them all that's what i say uh all right let's go to the next call let's
02:11:18 go to the next call there's two more this one's from pcp fan unconditional hate guy so let's uh
02:11:25 let's get ready for a roasting thoroughly hey guys this season of the pcp has been pretty
02:11:32 fucking great for like a character motivation sense so keep that shit up i mean i know y'all are just
02:11:37 faking your lives um but anyways i just wanted to say i think it's really fucking rich uh that digi
02:11:44 thinks that uh having a child is any less of a risk than college in fact it has just about the same
02:11:51 potential downsides but greater so like if we're gonna grill someone who's like 18 and everyone
02:11:58 everyone in their fucking lives remembers when they were 18 and they didn't know what the fuck
02:12:02 they were gonna do with their lives even if you got advice you don't have to beat a man into the
02:12:06 ground when basically he's going because his mom wants him to go it's gonna happen so if we could
02:12:11 just yeah hear that this kind of good stuff but wow that kind of sounded like victor like in disguise
02:12:19 calling in to yell at his brother uh well whatever i mean you know i did you made his points fair
02:12:26 enough he was clearly drunk i think he'd probably walk back a good bit of that no no no no no no
02:12:32 you know i don't he was he was pretty much on the same wavelength in person when we had that
02:12:37 discussion before okay yeah all right i gotta say i really just don't get the whole um like
02:12:45 just saying like i want to have kids or i'm not gonna have kids like deciding one or the other
02:12:50 like i guess it's cuz like i agree i come from a background where having kids is not something
02:12:56 that people decide right right so like i don't know like my view on on on it is like i'm just gonna
02:13:05 keep fucking and if a kid pops out then that's gonna be all right okay it's not that hard to not have
02:13:11 a baby it's not it's not yeah like just keep fucking people and if it happens it happens you got that
02:13:16 problem just keep fucking just keep fucking um well in the comparison of the comparison of having
02:13:29 a kid to going to college that you know kind of makes sense it kind of makes sense because you
02:13:33 don't know i mean i guess anyone who wants to have a kid it's not someone who wants to run for political
02:13:39 office all right that you kind of have to have an ego in that you're you think you'll do a good job
02:13:43 you know at least a little bit or you're just not worried about it i guess it's like rolling
02:13:47 the dice twice you're rolling it wants to have a kid and then you're rolling it again to see if
02:13:51 they want to go to college as well so basically you could get both bad sides you could get the
02:13:55 you could like it could be like twice double i mean it's obviously expensive to have like just
02:14:01 put in cold terms having a kid definitely costs money in time fair enough it costs love i guess
02:14:06 if you can produce that i can't relate um and uh uh yeah you don't know i i'm pretty convinced
02:14:12 i'll be a decent dad i mean i could be totally wrong i could be wrong about that i think i'm
02:14:18 going to try to prioritize what's best for it parenthood really needs a free demo what the
02:14:22 fuck i would love a free demo that'd be really nice it'd be really actually i kind of am doing
02:14:26 that with a dog uh you know it's my responsibility the demo that tested it out a little bit you know
02:14:33 that's fair it's going so pretty well so far except he's pooping a lot uh all over the place
02:14:37 inside gotta straighten him out real quick he pulls out gun um yeah so i don't know you know what
02:14:46 fair i that's a relatively fair point um i think digi happens to hate college for personal reasons
02:14:52 i probably am similar in that boat a lot of a lot of personal reasons coming for me as to why
02:14:57 i'm not a big fan um just move on just move on normal college ever no please the memes that
02:15:03 years ago he's right all right he he is right okay okay we got one more call one more voicemail
02:15:08 here this is from uh let me say this is from uh racist forest gump um coming in with a hot take
02:15:16 i know it i'm gonna do it janay i'm gonna say the n word no no forest you can't say the n word
02:15:26 that's racist janay you can't stop me i'm gonna say the n word no forest don't do it no don't do it
02:15:36 no all right janay here i go no forest don't do it it's racist what would opoma think here i
02:15:49 you're like all right janay i'm gonna say no stop stop oh that's the end oh thank god
02:16:02 signal signal disconnected that was a close one we almost got deleted um i played that one

02:19:42 like are you gonna remove all my blood and make me white like i can fucking do it all the fucking
02:19:46 god damn day what if i were to make the argument that you're not hispanic enough because you're only
02:19:51 half um that's oh god i'm going to jail
02:20:01 what does bina mean i was gonna say you can only say half the words monster you can only say the
02:20:05 first syllables you're not allowed to say the rest of it that's right if you say the colloquial
02:20:10 bina bina that's fine isn't that isn't that worse though like if you go up to like a half black
02:20:16 person and say you're not black enough that's like really a faux paul like even worse than i mean
02:20:21 people make that argument though which is bizarre to me yeah i don't know if i have a friend who's
02:20:26 half black and half white is it worse for me to uh to say the fucking racial slurs or is it worse
02:20:34 for me to say that they can't because they're not black enough it well that's your right so everything's
02:20:41 just wrong for you that's no that's wrong i'm that comes back that comes back to the question i'm a good
02:20:46 boy everything that i do is right do you value like do you value like independent freedom or do you
02:20:53 value like making sure no one's offended at everyone's i value being able to make the funny noises come
02:20:59 out of my mouth yeah well like luckily i don't but you know there's a there's a it's a fair criticism
02:21:05 to say that that is literally maybe influenced by the fact that you have never been the target of
02:21:12 this ethnic discrimination well i literally been ethnic like bullied for being in different ethnicity
02:21:19 than the white kids in my neighborhood i can fucking say all the racial slurs i want yeah i i i get i
02:21:25 get that that's kind of that's kind of a like a bullshit argument i think because like everyone
02:21:30 has been fucking like bullied and ridiculed in their life for something so like to say that you
02:21:36 can't say like you then you shouldn't be able to say stupid or fat or fucking anything i mean that's
