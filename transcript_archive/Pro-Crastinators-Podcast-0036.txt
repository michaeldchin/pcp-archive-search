00:00:00 Well, there is a lot that goes into making these game reviews and there's actually so much that I could sit here for like three hours and still, you know, there could be more things to talk about that I forgot to mention.
00:00:13 I kind of just take for granted that there is a lot that goes into making these videos.
00:00:18 See, for me, I don't really think about it that much because I've made over a hundred episodes and I've become very efficient at it.
00:00:24 So to me, it's like the same way I don't think about brushing my teeth. You know, I do it so many times.
00:00:37 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Thanks for tuning in.
00:00:43 And today, actually, we're starting a special new thing. But before we get to that, let's just see who's here with us.
00:00:48 It's of course me, the best guy ever. We have Digibro with us.
00:00:52 Hey, what's up, y'all?
00:00:54 The Hippo Crit.
00:00:56 Add me in in post.
00:00:58 Tom Oliver.
00:01:00 Yo.
00:01:01 And The Davoo Collective.
00:01:03 Zap, zappy.
00:01:05 Okay, so here's our thing guys. We're doing a new thing. So as I'm sure everyone in the world knows, the new Twitter for the PCP is officially made and it's out there in the world.
00:01:17 At TP Crastinators. So go find it there. There'll be a link in the description. All that good stuff.
00:01:23 And what we did was that we asked people for suggestions for topics for the show.
00:01:28 And so today is the first time that we are taking someone's suggestion and it is at SpaceyFilmer.
00:01:36 It is their suggestion. I think that's a guy who was going to say his, but I don't know for sure.
00:01:41 And their suggestion was the writing slash editing process. And I think this was a separate suggestion, nitpicking slash overanalyzing.
00:01:49 But since that applies to my writing and editing process, I'm going to pretend it was part of the same thing.
00:01:55 So who wants to start us off talking about their writing and editing process?
00:01:59 Nate, why don't you, since you have the most complicated and intimate and deeply disturbing process of us all.
00:02:07 I think yours is going to be the one that makes the rest of us look like we don't work.
00:02:12 I think that's probably true. It was funny. Just before we started, Tom said,
00:02:17 if editing a video takes more than one day, I want to kill myself.
00:02:22 And here I am, looking at my chart I've got here two weeks into this current project at 53% completion.
00:02:29 And yes, I've been calculating it and that's the exact percentage.
00:02:32 What's your average hours per day you've been working on it?
00:02:34 About five hours per day.
00:02:36 Every day?
00:02:38 Every day, that's right.
00:02:40 You see, these things are not practical, but I do them anyway.
00:02:44 And this whole project, I've been working on Ghost in the Shell,
00:02:48 but I decided to pick up this one just to get something out,
00:02:51 because it'd been a little while since I'd put out a big video.
00:02:54 Of course, I can't remember what the fuck the word is. It was a masterpiece,
00:02:57 but I thought I'd do something else a little more in tune with my regular content.
00:03:03 Of course, like everything, it's taken way too long.
00:03:06 But anyway, for this current video I'm working on, I just had an idea,
00:03:11 and it was kind of similar to my process for making the first Gern Lagen,
00:03:17 best guy ever, whatever video it was, where I just had an idea,
00:03:22 and I just did whatever it took to make it real, whether or not it was practical or not.
00:03:26 But since that was the first video for the channel, that didn't matter.
00:03:30 But I think probably the process of making shit is more interesting
00:03:35 for things like the part two of the Gern Lagen one.
00:03:40 So for that, I also just, I had an idea.
00:03:43 It always starts with just the seed of an idea for the video to make, of course.
00:03:47 And it was, the context of making that was just,
00:03:50 I've already got this initial kind of reaction to the show in this case,
00:03:56 and now I want to expand on the reasons why I like it so much.
00:04:00 So I always start with a thesis statement of that nature.
00:04:04 And then the way that I made that into a video was, first, watch the whole thing twice.
00:04:13 So I watched the whole show through, and as I went through, I just took notes
00:04:18 on every single episode and everything I thought that was noteworthy.
00:04:21 I then took all those notes, having completed that,
00:04:24 and organized them into a series of topics that were relevant for the thing I was trying to make.
00:04:29 So I did that, and then I organized them into an order that made sense
00:04:34 to get to the ultimate point I was trying to make,
00:04:36 which in this case was the stuff about how there's things to be learned from Gern Lagen,
00:04:41 and all these practical lessons that it's trying to teach us.
00:04:45 And so everything was building to that point.
00:04:47 And then I had to go through, and because the video was already,
00:04:49 because there were way too many topics, I had to cut a bunch of shit
00:04:53 that wasn't directly related to what I was talking about.
00:04:57 That video only focuses on narrative stuff.
00:05:01 It doesn't talk at all about art or any of that stuff.
00:05:04 So all that stuff I just threw aside because it wasn't pertinent.
00:05:08 And then I then converted those notes into a script.
00:05:12 And this was probably the hardest step, turning them into actual senses and doing that shit.
00:05:17 I mean, that took a while.
00:05:19 And up to that point, it was probably like two to three months of work.
00:05:23 And then at that point, it was just the three month more process of converting all those notes.
00:05:30 Or I did the voiceover, did the voice recording, that's fine.
00:05:32 And once I have the voice recording, I do that first.
00:05:35 I then go back over it.
00:05:36 I drop that shit in Vegas or Premiere or whatever.
00:05:39 And then I just start from the beginning and just start editing all the way through.
00:05:43 Yeah, what's up?
00:05:45 Sorry to cut off your momentum there.
00:05:47 No problem, no problem.
00:05:48 The what you're describing to me, this is in my mind the classical idea of how to go about.
00:05:57 And I don't just mean that in the writing sense.
00:05:59 The whole concept of the video is like back when I started as an animate writer,
00:06:05 exactly what you're doing is what I sort of dreamed of.
00:06:09 I saw it as you've got your favorite shows and nothing in the world matters
00:06:15 in the face of just talking about your favorite shows.
00:06:18 Everything else you talk about is because it's whatever, you're just interested for a week or so.
00:06:24 It's just a little flight of fancy.
00:06:26 Oh, here's an idea I had for a video.
00:06:28 But your favorite shows is these titans that you feel like you're never going to be able to sleep right until you've done it.
00:06:35 Until you've really sold everyone and why it's so special.
00:06:38 And for me, I had this thing I did starting in 2009 called The Epic Journey,
00:06:45 because I was a fucking teenager and the word epic was the word back then that you used.
00:06:51 The Epic Journey, the idea was I was going to analyze or just talk about all of my favorite anime
00:06:59 and first I would write about how I remembered them, then rewatch the show and then watch it again while writing about it.
00:07:07 And I did this with FLCL, where that's the only one I ever actually did to completion,
00:07:12 but I wrote about it beforehand, watched the commentaries, watched all the episodes,
00:07:16 wrote these in-depth analytical pieces about each episode.
00:07:20 So I covered all six episodes and then a final thoughts kind of piece.
00:07:24 So it was this big huge project, but then the prospect of doing that for every favorite show I have
00:07:32 is so much work just to do FLCL.
00:07:37 And for a long time I dreamed of doing things the way you're doing.
00:07:42 What finally got me past that was Evangelion, because I wanted to tackle Eva,
00:07:49 but I felt like I have to say everything there is to say about it.
00:07:52 There has to be no stone left unturned, because so many people have talked about it before,
00:07:56 it has to be the ultimate, it has to be the most thorough analysis of Eva possible.
00:08:01 And what I had planned to do was to do a podcast about every single episode,
00:08:06 half of them with guests, where I'd take people who I know have talked about the show,
00:08:11 like Demolition D, Go Jesus, Jesse, I had already told all of them about this.
00:08:16 This was going to happen, this huge project of podcasting every episode.
00:08:20 And then I was going to take all of the ideas presented by everybody in all the podcasts
00:08:25 and then write a book about Eva, like a full stop book and cover everything.
00:08:32 And that project is just so huge that there was no way it would happen.
00:08:37 It was like, you know, I'd think about it and I'm just like,
00:08:40 if I start on this, this is going to be my life for half a year, you know,
00:08:44 which is exactly what your process has been.
00:08:46 Well, I mean it was never my goal, I see what you're saying,
00:08:48 but it was never my goal to talk in depth about every aspect of the show.
00:08:52 And in my opinion, I only talked about a very narrow range of ideas.
00:08:56 I only talked about specifically like the scientific application
00:09:00 and like the philosophical meaning behind the show.
00:09:02 I mean, I would have loved to spend time talking about like the humor of the show,
00:09:05 which I think is nobody talks about like analyzing humor and stuff.
00:09:10 It's a huge problem in all of analysis.
00:09:13 No one's doing good analysis of comedy and humor.
00:09:16 It's tough, it's a shame.
00:09:18 But yeah, I mean, I'm glad that you didn't cover absolutely everything
00:09:21 because when I finished your video, I like mental note,
00:09:24 I still get to do cool character designs growing the gun,
00:09:26 which I'd planned for long before you ever made your video.
00:09:29 I had that plan, you know, that was always going to happen and it finally did.
00:09:33 But you know, that's, I just think that, sure, you didn't cover absolutely everything,
00:09:39 but it's just that mindset of like, I have to say all that I have to say
00:09:42 and make it this big, huge deal, you know.
00:09:45 And what finally got me past that was looking at Ava and just going,
00:09:49 all right, maybe one day I can write a book about Ava.
00:09:52 But for now, what if I just like, every time I have a thought about the show,
00:09:55 let's make a video about it, you know, doesn't have to be the whole thing.
00:09:58 Just every single time I have some thought that hasn't been expressed,
00:10:01 let's make a video about it.
00:10:02 And I sort of went with that approach and I've made like seven or eight Ava videos
00:10:06 that people seem to really like.
00:10:08 Well, okay, okay, but I mean, this does tie into my, you know, video making process.
00:10:13 I mean, at this point in my career, I guess you'd say,
00:10:16 I feel that I need to do things to distinguish myself from, you know, everyone out there.
00:10:20 And I think I'm definitely doing so.
00:10:22 And to be honest, I think I'm making some of the best content
00:10:25 when it actually comes out, which is rare.
00:10:27 And obviously that's a huge problem.
00:10:29 So, I mean, do you think that's a mistake?
00:10:32 I mean, obviously it's not the most efficient way of doing things,
00:10:34 but it is the way I provide that.
00:10:35 I think it's not a mistake because, I mean, you're getting more subscribers for less,
00:10:41 for less content because people really like the,
00:10:45 the quality level.
00:10:47 If they just wanted to, you know, I mean,
00:10:50 the way I think about my videos is I could technically do the stuff you do
00:10:55 and it would take probably a bit longer because I'm not used to doing that.
00:10:58 But I just, I don't care so much about it being as flashy as possible
00:11:03 because I just want things to be made.
00:11:05 And it's like, but as a result, I don't get quite as much clout
00:11:11 or whatever word I'm trying to think of.
00:11:13 Yeah.
00:11:14 Like I'm not seen as like the flashiest, coolest guy.
00:11:19 Yeah, I mean, I talked about this in my last decompression vlog
00:11:23 that like people look at Nate or Jesse and they look at those big videos
00:11:27 and those are videos that like they will always be coming back to
00:11:30 and talking about and thinking about.
00:11:32 Like, I think for most people who've seen the Gurren Lagann analysis,
00:11:35 that is now like intrinsically tied into Gurren Lagann for them.
00:11:39 Like, it's not like a YouTube video about the show.
00:11:43 It's like a part of the show.
00:11:44 It's part of how they recognize it now, you know?
00:11:47 Yeah.
00:11:48 And you're sorted online.
00:11:49 And AstraScore, I'm sure, are similar for people.
00:11:52 Oh, certainly, yeah.
00:11:54 Especially AstraScore because for most people, that's the only exposure they've had.
00:11:58 I mean, yeah, people didn't have much to say about it before that, I'm sure.
00:12:01 But yeah, I think it's great that you do those kinds of videos
00:12:05 and I'd love for you to always have them come out, you know, once in a while.
00:12:09 But I think that, well, here's what's going to save you,
00:12:13 is that you don't have that many favorites.
00:12:15 Like, there's not that many shows I think you could cover this right.
00:12:18 You know?
00:12:19 Like, I mean, there's Ghost in the Shell.
00:12:20 There's One Piece.
00:12:21 There's, you know, Star Trek, TNG.
00:12:23 And like, once you've covered all those, there's not going to be a need
00:12:26 for a 50-minute best guy ever analysis about something
00:12:30 because you've covered the giants that you care about.
00:12:32 You know, it's a shame about this whole thing.
00:12:34 I think I can get away with continuing this sort of thing
00:12:37 with, like, you know, we're going to Ghost in the Shell now.
00:12:40 But I've already, in my mind, come up with a solution to this,
00:12:43 which is just basically just splitting up the fucking video.
00:12:46 And then, like, by doing that, I can still talk in as much depth
00:12:50 and crazy editing as I want.
00:12:51 But a video will come out maybe every month, possibly every two months,
00:12:55 just because they're all part of a series as opposed to, you know, one...
00:13:00 It was a big mistake to do all of Gern-Lagan one thing.
00:13:03 It's great. I love that it's a package, but, you know...
00:13:06 That's what I've been doing with my Rayman review.
00:13:10 Right, and it's perfect.
00:13:11 Like, the first part...
00:13:12 Exactly the right way to go.
00:13:13 It was really good.
00:13:14 It was really good.
00:13:15 Thanks.
00:13:16 But, like, the part one is 10 minutes long.
00:13:18 But if I had included the rest of the part one that I've written,
00:13:21 it would be maybe 40 minutes long.
00:13:24 Part two is going to be 20 minutes.
00:13:26 I don't know how many parts it's going to have.
00:13:28 I really wrote too much.
00:13:29 But having that little, you know, 10 minutes is, you know,
00:13:32 is decent enough for a...
00:13:33 You know, it's important for guys like us, you know,
00:13:36 at our early stage of the YouTube game here,
00:13:39 to be producing, you know, just shit as fast as possible
00:13:43 and to get ourselves out there as best we can.
00:13:46 And by the way, before we move on from the How Great I Am thing,
00:13:50 now's an appropriate time for me to put out the story about how yesterday,
00:13:54 Sy, a man with 150,000 subscribers,
00:13:57 came to me asking me for creative expertise
00:14:01 on how to edit something better.
00:14:03 So I'm just saying, people out there are taking note of what I can do.
00:14:07 I mean, for the record, Nate, I have 250,000 subscribers.
00:14:10 I would definitely come to you for editing.
00:14:12 Yeah, but I don't...
00:14:13 You don't matter.
00:14:14 You don't matter.
00:14:15 You're nobody.
00:14:16 If I wanted to know how to make a screen stretch and explode,
00:14:18 I would ask you about it for sure.
00:14:20 Right.
00:14:21 But we're friends.
00:14:22 You know, I've known you for a long time.
00:14:23 I've known that thought of the splitting videos in parts.
00:14:26 And I want to touch on that, how that happens for me.
00:14:30 And it sounds like it's going this way for you guys as well.
00:14:32 Because it used to be that you would write a video to be shorter
00:14:36 because YouTube audience retention was so low.
00:14:40 People's average three to five minutes watch time per video.
00:14:44 And it used to be that people tried to keep videos short
00:14:46 or tried to break them into parts so that more people would watch it.
00:14:49 That is not a concern anymore.
00:14:51 And YouTube length does not matter.
00:14:53 You've got Matthew Matosis putting out six fucking hour-long
00:14:56 commentaries that have well over 100,000 views.
00:15:00 The market's there.
00:15:02 But what it's become now is it's really about money.
00:15:06 And I say that with as little cynicism as possible,
00:15:10 but we need to be able to make enough money to make...
00:15:15 If I make a video that's like Mob Psycho 100,
00:15:20 the one I did on that, it's like seven minutes long.
00:15:23 And it's like concept of completion in like a day.
00:15:26 I watched the whole show.
00:15:28 I already knew Victor had already given me an idea of something to say about it.
00:15:32 Because Victor requested me to watch that show and do an analysis of it.
00:15:35 He kind of gave me the idea of what it was going to be like.
00:15:38 So I watched the show.
00:15:39 I already have in mind what I'm going to say about it.
00:15:41 I write the video.
00:15:42 I give it to Davoo.
00:15:43 He edits it that night.
00:15:45 It's out within like 24 hours of being conceptualized.
00:15:48 That's a beautiful thing.
00:15:49 And that video...
00:15:51 If I post it on YouTube and it gets...
00:15:54 And that video has a shit ton of views because it was a popular show.
00:15:57 But I can post that out and I can post it on Patreon.
00:16:00 And it's like considered one video.
00:16:03 Then you've got Akiyuki Shinbo in the 90s,
00:16:06 which is months of watching anime.
00:16:09 It's tons and tons of shows that me and Davoo watched.
00:16:14 And it's 40 minutes long in total between the two parts.
00:16:19 And Davoo spent days editing that.
00:16:22 And the product, if it was one video, if it had just been one video,
00:16:28 it would have had like 50,000 views, much less than Mob Psycho had.
00:16:33 And it would only be one post on Patreon.
00:16:36 So it makes just as much money as Mob Psycho did.
00:16:38 And if not less, because it depends on when it comes out in the month.
00:16:42 So for me, that video was written as one video.
00:16:46 I just arbitrarily split it at a point where it could be split into two.
00:16:51 And each one is substantial.
00:16:53 There's no problem with splitting a video.
00:16:55 I mean, who suffers when you split a video into two parts?
00:16:57 Nobody. It just comes out a little later.
00:16:59 I think it's interesting that that's kind of the way we're having to do things
00:17:02 because YouTube rewards frequency.
00:17:05 It rewards multiple uploads.
00:17:07 It rewards people remaining on your channel for multiple videos.
00:17:10 That's a huge part of how you get paid is when people go through your catalogue
00:17:14 or they go from your videos to another one.
00:17:16 And longer videos are actually better for the YouTube algorithm.
00:17:20 But multiple long videos in a string is even better still.
00:17:25 And each one will probably have better retention on its own
00:17:28 than the whole one would have had by itself.
00:17:31 It's crazy how fast you can get to 100k if you make videos for your niche every day.
00:17:35 Yeah. Oh my God.
00:17:37 You need to be frequent.
00:17:39 And even for the big channels, this is a huge concern.
00:17:42 You saw how H3H3 had split between Ethan and Ela and H3H3
00:17:47 and they were posting way more on Ethan and Ela
00:17:49 and they were like, this is killing our main channel
00:17:51 because we're only uploading once every two weeks
00:17:55 as opposed to once every two days, our fucking rates are just dropping.
00:18:00 So we're fusing our channel so this won't happen.
00:18:02 I mean, that's a channel with 2 million fucking subscribers
00:18:05 making crazy money and even they're worried about the frequency of their uploads and shit.
00:18:10 If you want that growth, if you want that steady growth
00:18:15 and if you want to keep making money, you got to have frequency and some regularity
00:18:19 and each individual splitting a 40 minute video in two.
00:18:24 I mean, I could have split it into fucking four,
00:18:26 but I like it to be in these big chunks.
00:18:30 I wanted you to get enough of the narrative to get invested.
00:18:33 Because with RoboPixels, I've been releasing one video every week, every two weeks
00:18:36 for like the last year and just the last two weeks
00:18:39 I started doing vlogs and now there's two videos a week.
00:18:42 My subscriber growth month over month tripled
00:18:45 and if you count, doubled and fucking earnings doubled.
00:18:49 You know, that's why I was so happy with...
00:18:54 I saw Gabe's video, I can't remember the fucking word, you know, whatever
00:18:59 and I was just like, this is hilarious, I'd love to make something like this
00:19:03 and just that night, like it came out in the morning, I watched it while I was at work
00:19:07 that night I rushed home and in the span of like five hours
00:19:10 I was able to get a video done and I was just so thrilled about that fact
00:19:14 I was able to get something done that I had to put it on the main channel
00:19:17 instead of BestieBoy, which it obviously belongs on
00:19:20 but I was just so thrilled to actually have something to post
00:19:24 with that level of speed that I couldn't help myself.
00:19:27 It's a great video.
00:19:28 Yeah, but we should be talking about the process of making videos rather.
00:19:32 Oh, there was only one thing, we can move on from me.
00:19:35 There was only one other thing that I thought was interesting
00:19:37 that people might enjoy hearing about, about my editing style
00:19:41 and it's that, so I talked a bunch before about how I get up to the point of
00:19:45 I've now got my voice recording of the script
00:19:49 and then I just start to edit through it
00:19:51 but did you know, viewer, that the first thing I do
00:19:54 after I have the voice recording script, before I do any visual editing
00:19:58 is I go and I pick music for every section of the video
00:20:02 and not only do I just put an appropriate sounding song behind it
00:20:07 I attempt, it's amazing how well this usually works out
00:20:11 I attempt to like sync important things with like relevant beats
00:20:17 and drops in the audio
00:20:19 and sometimes it works out astoundingly well
00:20:21 like, remember in the end of the Gernlagen part 2 video
00:20:26 I'm playing that song from Bravely Default, it's like the ending theme song
00:20:30 and there's all this epic shit going on when I say personal fucking responsibility
00:20:35 like, the song just happened to drop exactly at the right time
00:20:39 for me to like put that explosion and be like pfft
00:20:42 it was synchronicity of a fascinating degree
00:20:46 it was serendipity, that's right
00:20:48 and then, so yeah, I do that and then I edit the visuals
00:20:51 and I put a bunch of memes, all that shit
00:20:53 so there you go, that's an interesting insight into how I do things
00:20:57 so we can move on from me now if we want to talk about somebody else's
00:21:01 well, I guess I'll go
00:21:03 because I'm speaking about the music
00:21:06 I usually leave the music until after I have all the visuals in place
00:21:09 because I know it
00:21:11 well, I mean sometimes I think, oh, I've got to have a specific thing here
00:21:14 but usually I just like having something vaguely relevant
00:21:17 and, you know, a beat to keep it going smoothly
00:21:21 but yeah, music is, I don't really think about it too much
00:21:24 even though I like music a lot
00:21:26 I actually have several, I think about it way too much
00:21:29 and I have a folder of songs that I think will evoke certain emotions
00:21:34 on my computer that I just have in place for when I'm going to use them
00:21:38 I've already got like three picked out for Ghost of the Shell at various points
00:21:41 yeah, I tried to make a database of that
00:21:43 like collect songs I could possibly use as background
00:21:46 and add tags to like label their aesthetic elements
00:21:49 and I gave up
00:21:51 I don't have an organized system or anything, anyway, sorry again
00:21:55 well, I guess I'll talk about my writing style
00:21:58 because it's quite regimented now
00:22:02 what I have, I have a Google Doc called Video Ideas
00:22:05 and every time I have an idea for a game that I want to talk about at some point
00:22:09 or something, I go in there and I just write it down
00:22:12 in a big long list
00:22:14 and whenever I start to write it
00:22:18 I make another Google Doc and then link to that Google Doc in the Video Ideas document
00:22:23 so I have a big old thing where I can scroll through
00:22:27 and see which, I highlight which ones I finished
00:22:30 which ones I've recorded the audio for
00:22:33 and which ones I just need to edit
00:22:35 and I've got a whole big thing of that
00:22:37 hey, can I ask you a question about your process?
00:22:40 I'm just curious, if you're like me in this one aspect of
00:22:43 when I'm writing a script
00:22:45 and I thought that you're more like this than anybody else I think
00:22:49 when I'm writing a script, I find it extremely hard to write anything
00:22:52 that I think will actually be funny, like any real jokes
00:22:55 but when I'm editing and I have like my fairly serious voice
00:22:58 it's really easy for me to just put something retarded
00:23:01 and it's hilarious, like juxtaposed against the fairly serious things I'm saying
00:23:05 do you do that too? Is that where you get most of your humor?
00:23:08 I think, well I do write a lot of jokes into my scripts
00:23:11 like if I just look at a script now
00:23:13 I would put in Asterix how I would edit something to be funny
00:23:18 like pause for effect, zoom in on this guy's face after I say
00:23:22 oh dear, I actually write that into the script as I'm going
00:23:26 like that'll sound good
00:23:28 sometimes the live action stuff that I record
00:23:31 doesn't actually work in the way that I intended it to
00:23:34 or the way I wanted it to
00:23:36 but when I am editing I can sometimes make it better
00:23:39 like some of the live action sections in that Rayman video
00:23:42 I didn't like them, but I added some weird effects and then they were funny
00:23:47 but you know, more funny than not
00:23:49 there's a lot of changing things as it goes along to make it flow better I experience
00:23:55 so the way I do the reviews, I mean it used to be different
00:23:58 for Dark Cloud I didn't play the game at all
00:24:02 I just knew it so well that I wrote the entire thing
00:24:05 and then played the game to get some footage
00:24:08 but nowadays obviously it's a better idea to play the game
00:24:12 and take notes
00:24:14 if you've ever watched AVGN
00:24:17 he has a video where he goes through his editing process
00:24:20 called I think he does like a pixel just a random game
00:24:23 and he goes through the entire process of playing the game
00:24:26 writing the review, editing it and all that
00:24:28 and it's really interesting and really informative
00:24:31 so you should look at that AVGN
00:24:34 making of an AVGN episode
00:24:36 and I based a lot of how I write scripts and take notes off of that
00:24:40 especially for GRPJ
00:24:42 I think, no not GRPJ
00:24:45 I can't remember what I do
00:24:47 Or the miniscule review?
00:24:49 No miniscule reviews are just sort of like I just write about it
00:24:52 and I don't really
00:24:54 the thing about miniscule reviews is that there's no live action
00:24:58 there's no big skits
00:25:00 it's just sort of me being a goof and playing a game
00:25:03 Those are probably the most like traditionally
00:25:05 probably would be successful YouTube videos
00:25:08 If I could make loads of those all the time then I would
00:25:11 I'm always trying to make a big hypocrite video
00:25:15 How hypocritical of you
00:25:18 Not really
00:25:21 You really are the best guy ever
00:25:24 Oh no
00:25:29 But yeah, I write down things
00:25:35 Oh, specifically regarding game footage
00:25:39 because making a video game review is harder than anime
00:25:42 in the fact that you have to get footage for everything you're talking about
00:25:45 Oh yeah, yeah, totally
00:25:47 So I would only try to write notes on stuff that I'm actually doing
00:25:50 So I would play the game something like Rayman
00:25:53 I would record like level one
00:25:55 the whole level through and then stop recording
00:25:58 so that I have a file of that level and just name it that level
00:26:01 and then continue playing
00:26:03 and every time there's like something particularly like
00:26:06 if I need to look at a walkthrough
00:26:08 for a certain part that's hard
00:26:10 I write down in my notes this part's really hard
00:26:12 this is the link to the walkthrough that I'm looking at
00:26:14 in case I need to take a screenshot and put that in
00:26:16 Interesting, early on into me making video game related videos
00:26:20 especially back then when I didn't have a very powerful computer
00:26:23 where editing with files that were very long at all
00:26:27 just completely choked up the editing software
00:26:30 It's really annoying to scrub through a whole like two hour thing
00:26:33 I always try to split it
00:26:35 I was not very good at scrubbing either at the time
00:26:38 so I was just splitting the recording up every like two to five minutes
00:26:41 like every time it felt like I was doing a different thing
00:26:44 I would break it up and make a new recording
00:26:47 and then when I was done
00:26:49 after writing the video
00:26:51 think about the different dynamics of the game
00:26:53 that I'm going to talk about
00:26:55 and then look at each of the individual clips
00:26:57 and put them into folders corresponding to the different things
00:27:00 like hey this clip shows off the level design pretty well
00:27:03 this clip shows off the main villain pretty well
00:27:05 put them in their respective folders
00:27:08 and that's how I did that
00:27:10 but I haven't really made any video game videos in a long time
00:27:12 I don't even know how I would do it now
00:27:14 see that's quite a clever thing to do
00:27:16 because what I do with just having a level
00:27:19 usually what I'm writing the script
00:27:21 I'm like I go through level by level things that happen
00:27:25 so I'm sort of walking through the game as I analyze it and stuff
00:27:29 but sometimes I can't find a particular moment in a thing
00:27:33 but I know it's in A level
00:27:35 so I just go to that level and I still have to scrub sometimes
00:27:38 quite a bit
00:27:39 if I had the patience to put things into specific folders
00:27:42 so I could just instantly grab them from there
00:27:45 that would be pretty good
00:27:46 to comment on this
00:27:47 because obviously I'm not as known for doing game videos as you
00:27:50 but I have done a number of them
00:27:52 and it's funny because my process is like
00:27:56 almost entirely built out of desperation
00:27:58 to do as little work on it as possible
00:28:01 because I hate editing
00:28:02 smart way to go
00:28:03 and I hate capturing footage
00:28:05 because when I play through a game
00:28:07 it's usually like I don't usually play a game intending to analyze it
00:28:11 like most of the games that I have written about
00:28:14 I had the idea after the game
00:28:16 and then it's like there's no fucking way I'm going to play through the whole thing again
00:28:19 to capture the footage
00:28:21 but I need enough
00:28:22 I need enough to work with
00:28:23 so I'll use like
00:28:26 I'll use as much let's play footage as I can find
00:28:28 if I'm talking about specific moments
00:28:30 if it's like
00:28:32 this boss is super hard or whatever
00:28:34 I'll just grab a let's play
00:28:35 and it's kind of funny to me
00:28:37 that gaming YouTubers
00:28:39 seem to be so
00:28:41 proud in particular about capturing their own footage
00:28:44 and about having it be 60 frames, 1080p
00:28:47 which is a lot that I don't do
00:28:49 I don't care about that
00:28:50 I mean when it comes to the footage
00:28:52 me recording it
00:28:53 it's mostly just because I have done the whole
00:28:56 let's look at let's plays and get the footage
00:28:58 it's easier thing
00:28:59 but it's so frustrating when
00:29:02 they don't have the specific moment
00:29:04 that I'm looking for
00:29:05 or like the videos
00:29:06 all the let's plays are like really bad quality
00:29:09 or like one of them is a low quality
00:29:11 but it has the bit you need
00:29:12 and all the high quality footage
00:29:13 doesn't have what you need
00:29:14 I've gone through that
00:29:15 but like for me
00:29:17 I mean I don't fucking care
00:29:18 like if it's low quality for like 10 seconds
00:29:21 I don't care
00:29:22 you know because the audience
00:29:24 isn't going to
00:29:25 they're not going to say anything
00:29:26 you know I've never had a complaint about it
00:29:28 and I get why like for guys like
00:29:30 hyper bit hero and gaming Brit and stuff
00:29:32 you know they want the 60 frames
00:29:34 because they really care about that stuff
00:29:36 those guys they're fucking 60 frames per second
00:29:38 they're so into the idea of
00:29:40 like all games have to be 60 frames
00:29:42 and I have to prove it through my
00:29:44 I hear that if you kill yourself in the name of video games
00:29:45 you go to heaven in art
00:29:46 and live in a giant bed with 60 virgin frames
00:29:51 it's like they think that by
00:29:53 is a virgin frame a frame with no picture in it
00:29:56 they think that by like putting the 60 frame
00:29:59 1080p video on YouTube
00:30:01 that that's going to help like sell people
00:30:03 on that but the reality is
00:30:05 that fucking 99%
00:30:07 of everybody is watching it windowed
00:30:09 in 720 you know
00:30:11 we're not fucking upscaling it
00:30:13 60 frames makes my fucking computer chug
00:30:15 even on you know because YouTube's horribly optimized
00:30:17 for it so like
00:30:19 I'm not going to fucking watch a video in 60 frames
00:30:21 I'm not even going to play the game in 60 frames
00:30:23 but like when it comes to me
00:30:25 collecting footage for a video like when I did
00:30:27 the Bloodborne vs Dark Souls
00:30:29 player character one it was like
00:30:31 most of the Dark Souls footage was from
00:30:33 me and Victor's Let's Play of Dark Souls
00:30:35 which was shitty looking in itself
00:30:37 because I had bad encoding for a lot of it
00:30:39 and then I like you know grabbed like
00:30:41 cutscene footage from different
00:30:43 Let's Plays and stuff or just cutscene uploads
00:30:45 on YouTube and then like for Bloodborne
00:30:47 I captured a bunch of me like
00:30:49 testing out all the weapons
00:30:51 so because I like really needed footage of like
00:30:53 somebody just using weapons and stuff
00:30:55 but like it was just you know
00:30:57 maybe 10 minutes. Luckily the PS4 makes that
00:30:59 pretty easy with this whole recording thing
00:31:01 well that thing sucks
00:31:03 because you can only record 15 minutes at a time
00:31:05 you get to start a video and it's fucking retarded
00:31:07 but I have an Elgato so it doesn't matter
00:31:09 so yeah I recorded like probably
00:31:11 like 20 minutes worth of
00:31:13 my own footage for that and then you know
00:31:15 pulled again cutscene footage and stuff from
00:31:17 online so like for me it's just like
00:31:19 how can I possibly edit this
00:31:21 with as little of me recording
00:31:23 and like as specific of me recording as possible
00:31:25 so I don't have to scrub through anything
00:31:27 and you know I'm willing to show
00:31:29 really non-specific shit
00:31:31 you know just like I'm because a lot of my videos
00:31:33 are like me rambling about broad concepts anyway
00:31:35 so it doesn't need to be like a specific boss
00:31:37 or something but like yeah
00:31:39 there's like a sense of when I edit
00:31:41 there's a sense of desperation to be like
00:31:43 I just want this fucking thing to be
00:31:45 out I want I don't want to have to go through
00:31:47 you know a huge
00:31:49 part of why I have DeVoo edit my videos
00:31:51 and we'll get to this when we talk about
00:31:53 his editing process as well
00:31:55 is that DeVoo will
00:31:57 I'll have him watch an entire
00:31:59 show for a video you know
00:32:01 it'll be like um here's
00:32:03 Mob Psycho we just watched the whole show together
00:32:05 he goes and edits it and he puts
00:32:07 all 13 episodes of the show
00:32:09 into a thing and then he
00:32:11 edits it what I do
00:32:13 is any episode
00:32:15 that I mentioned something that
00:32:17 like from that episode I take
00:32:19 that like let's say I mentioned that there's
00:32:21 a certain bad guy who does this
00:32:23 so I'll download the episode where that guy's
00:32:25 from and I'll put that in there
00:32:27 everything else is episode one
00:32:29 like or episode two sure
00:32:31 it's just anything you don't need that
00:32:33 bit yeah that's totally anything that's not
00:32:35 specific is just gonna be from episode one
00:32:37 so that I don't have to edit every
00:32:39 you know I don't have to go through every episode looking for
00:32:41 stuff but that I mean
00:32:43 clearly what DeVoo's doing makes a better
00:32:45 product you know like that's why I hire him
00:32:47 to do it because he pulls scenes
00:32:49 that I would have forgotten about or just
00:32:51 not bothered with whereas for me
00:32:53 like often times by the time I'm done editing
00:32:55 an anime video I have used
00:32:57 all of the good parts from episode one
00:32:59 like I have gutted that thing to death
00:33:01 you know and
00:33:03 and probably there's like
00:33:05 some 30 second chunk of the episode
00:33:07 that just isn't edited at all
00:33:09 somewhere in there you know like for me
00:33:11 it's like how can I maximize
00:33:13 impact with minimal effort
00:33:15 but you know it's funny you
00:33:17 if you can see like the way my files
00:33:19 look I have you know in Vegas
00:33:21 how you can put those like orange lines
00:33:23 with like a message indicator of like
00:33:25 or a tag or whatever I discovered
00:33:27 my talent is fucking full of like
00:33:29 specific things that need to go here
00:33:31 here here here here for a full fucking
00:33:33 that's I discovered that kind
00:33:35 of Vegas note taking because
00:33:37 of Neil X when he was doing the
00:33:39 elements of Brony series
00:33:41 I had to render those for him
00:33:43 because like his computer his laptop
00:33:45 was weak and he needed it for work
00:33:47 and he was like rendering those on a fucking
00:33:49 laptop yeah and he was like
00:33:51 you know rendering this will
00:33:53 literally seize up my laptop all day
00:33:55 I won't like I won't even be able to use it
00:33:57 so he would send me all the files
00:33:59 on copy which is like a
00:34:01 Dropbox alternative
00:34:03 that is dead now dude that was
00:34:05 my fucking the first
00:34:07 Gern Langen video the music one
00:34:09 I made that whole thing on a laptop too
00:34:11 and that fucking thing like Vegas
00:34:13 it was too long I used like clips from
00:34:15 like fucking a hundred episodes like
00:34:17 two movies they were all in the timeline
00:34:19 all to be loaded every time I opened it
00:34:21 it was like a ten minute process just waiting for that thing to load
00:34:23 and after a while the fucking thing would not
00:34:25 play in the fucking preview window
00:34:27 so my tests for editing were
00:34:29 to render the section
00:34:31 see if it looked okay if not okay adjust it
00:34:33 render it again see if it looks better
00:34:35 that's why that video took six months
00:34:37 to fucking make
00:34:39 anyway I know what that's like
00:34:41 well sorry a point I was making about
00:34:43 Neil is that he would send me
00:34:45 like all of his project files which is these
00:34:47 huge folders cause those
00:34:49 videos were the longest shit and they had tons and tons of sources
00:34:51 and he would have just like
00:34:53 shit loads of like notation
00:34:55 markers with like you know full sentences
00:34:57 in them like huge descriptors
00:34:59 like everything cause
00:35:01 Neil is a fucking lawyer you know he's
00:35:03 like a study guy
00:35:05 he knows how to take notes and shit
00:35:07 and like you open up his book
00:35:09 and it looks like fucking Twilight Sparkles
00:35:11 annotations on a
00:35:13 fucking book you know it's crazy
00:35:15 how much stuff was in there I was like I didn't know Vegas could
00:35:17 do this stuff and to me
00:35:19 it's also pointless cause I'm like
00:35:21 I don't need this organization I can just
00:35:23 memorize what everything is you know
00:35:25 but I guess for some people it's
00:35:27 more necessary
00:35:29 yeah you're a genius did you
00:35:31 we're all just a bunch of fucking fuck boy
00:35:33 idiots that's alright I agree
00:35:35 I agree I just have good memory
00:35:37 but um whatever
00:35:39 what was I saying oh yeah um
00:35:41 in relation to like
00:35:43 forgive the fucking ten minute tangent
00:35:45 yeah I fucking
00:35:47 oh yeah Nate the
00:35:49 thing you were saying about every
00:35:51 video about something you love having to
00:35:53 or whoever said it being
00:35:55 something you love you can't you have this feeling of
00:35:57 you have to talk about
00:35:59 everything properly and stuff
00:36:01 that's how I think that
00:36:03 the way I write and the way that the fact
00:36:05 that I record the gameplay
00:36:07 is because I need to make sure
00:36:09 that I'm right about whatever I'm about to say
00:36:11 so if I do
00:36:13 my Ratchet and Clank video
00:36:15 like I played the whole game again
00:36:17 and I record it and you know while I'm playing it
00:36:19 I might as well record it so I have the footage of what I want to talk about
00:36:21 and I play
00:36:23 the whole thing again just to make sure that yes
00:36:25 that is true what I'm saying
00:36:27 dude there is nothing more devastating
00:36:29 for every miniscule review any miniscule
00:36:31 review is like a game that I'm not that interested in
00:36:33 and I can make a short video and I can leave
00:36:35 out a lot of analysis and it's mostly
00:36:37 just me just
00:36:39 talking about something very vaguely
00:36:41 but the hypocrite reviews
00:36:43 they're usually long because
00:36:45 I want to make sure that everything I say
00:36:47 is real
00:36:49 there is nothing more devastating than putting
00:36:51 something in a video that turns out to be
00:36:53 wrong in any way and
00:36:55 this is also what I'm
00:36:57 bad about this because I judge people
00:36:59 extremely harshly if they get
00:37:01 anything wrong in their videos too
00:37:03 when I said that Nio was 14
00:37:05 or when I said Yoko was 14
00:37:07 people were like no she's not what are you talking
00:37:09 about dude and this consumed
00:37:11 me for like a month and I had to do
00:37:13 an in-depth research campaign because I realized
00:37:15 I actually had not investigated this
00:37:17 thoroughly enough to make that claim but in
00:37:19 time I was proven out to be correct
00:37:21 I believe I found the proof for you
00:37:23 it was on some website or something
00:37:25 some developers
00:37:27 you were looking for it and I got interested
00:37:29 and what I found was the official
00:37:31 the official Gurren Lagann website
00:37:33 in Japanese
00:37:35 when you translated it
00:37:37 it said Yoko is Simon's age
00:37:39 it specifically says
00:37:41 something like that
00:37:43 I remember we had a big argument
00:37:45 because there's two uploads for that Gurren
00:37:47 Lagann video the first one that's in my
00:37:49 playlist of deleted videos or whatever
00:37:51 because it got fucked up by copyright
00:37:53 there's a comment thread in there
00:37:55 that's like the full discussion about
00:37:57 that
00:37:59 oh god yeah
00:38:01 in regards to being wrong about stuff
00:38:03 and like playing through the whole game
00:38:05 to make sure you're not wrong about stuff
00:38:07 it's funny because
00:38:09 unlike Nate I play very fast
00:38:11 and loose with facts
00:38:13 and when people point out something wrong
00:38:15 like if it's something I agree
00:38:17 is wrong I just kind of like
00:38:19 upvote their comment and comment on it
00:38:21 and I'm like oh yeah good point
00:38:23 and if it's something that like
00:38:25 because I'm very obstinate about the idea
00:38:27 that like it doesn't matter to have everything
00:38:29 right as long as you get the point
00:38:31 you know as long as the overall video
00:38:33 is not wrong then that's what matters
00:38:35 this is something I've disagreed with you
00:38:37 for a long time about Digi don't you feel
00:38:39 a sense of journalistic integrity
00:38:41 to need to represent those correctly
00:38:43 there is a phrase there is a phrase in the
00:38:45 journalistic world called you don't get
00:38:47 the facts you get the truth
00:38:49 now I don't know how many journalists follow
00:38:51 along with that but if I may speak on behalf
00:38:53 of Digi's research process
00:38:55 that seems to be something that he does
00:38:57 can you break that down for me
00:38:59 when you tell stories of things that happen
00:39:01 you usually tell a fairly condensed
00:39:03 version where things are a little bit
00:39:05 flanderized well the reason they say that is because
00:39:07 you can't really know
00:39:09 all the facts about everything
00:39:11 like there's always going to be some detail
00:39:13 that maybe like if you're trying to talk about
00:39:15 say you know what the messages is
00:39:17 of Gurren Lagann for instance
00:39:19 like unless the creator
00:39:21 outright says like that's what I intended
00:39:23 then it's not so much that
00:39:25 you're saying like a fact about it
00:39:27 as you're you know talking about
00:39:29 what it makes you think and what
00:39:31 what you think it's about
00:39:33 it's not so much whether or not you're able to present
00:39:35 this overwhelming symphony
00:39:37 of evidence that makes you look infallible
00:39:39 it's more important that no one
00:39:41 in the comments is able to
00:39:43 create this symphony rebuttal that makes you
00:39:45 well that's fine and all
00:39:47 the thing is like
00:39:49 if you're basing your opinion
00:39:51 on something that you say
00:39:53 and it's actually incorrect
00:39:55 then people will call you on that
00:39:57 but like if your point is
00:39:59 this show is good because of the action
00:40:01 but you said the name of a character wrong
00:40:03 this show is good because of climate change
00:40:05 but if you say the name of a character wrong
00:40:07 that's not devaluing your point
00:40:09 your point is still correct
00:40:11 the point of that video was
00:40:13 obviously my interpretation of things
00:40:15 but if I had said Nia was 14
00:40:17 and Nia was just wrong
00:40:19 then that's a whole different thing
00:40:21 but the thing is that the reason
00:40:23 you were talking about her
00:40:25 whether or not she's literally 14
00:40:27 didn't matter
00:40:29 the point is that she's Simon's age
00:40:31 that she's around that age
00:40:33 that she's you know
00:40:35 relatively 14
00:40:37 is like what matters
00:40:39 not that she's literally 14
00:40:41 the argument that follows is based on that fact being true
00:40:43 I say she's closer to Simone's age
00:40:45 because it's a thematically relevant
00:40:47 because it's about her not being like Kamena
00:40:49 she's closer to Simone
00:40:51 she's like more mature
00:40:53 and you know that would still be true
00:40:55 if she was like 16 or even 18
00:40:57 I guess
00:40:59 but the things are predicated on getting your facts right
00:41:01 and if you get your facts wrong
00:41:03 and then you have faulty interpretations
00:41:05 then you're just misleading people
00:41:07 and I'm not saying that you're evil
00:41:09 I'm just saying it's your responsibility
00:41:11 I have definitely had
00:41:13 like frequently
00:41:15 I have just like outright
00:41:17 incorrect facts in my video
00:41:19 and people will point it out
00:41:21 but like usually
00:41:23 I mean it never creates an uproar
00:41:25 it's never destroyed a video
00:41:27 at worst one guy gets mad
00:41:29 and leaves a comment about it
00:41:31 and I laugh at him for being a comment
00:41:33 this is actually a large motivating factor
00:41:35 for why I'm interested in making videos
00:41:37 in a series as opposed to one standalone obelisk
00:41:39 because if I get something wrong
00:41:41 like the first one like YMS did
00:41:43 in his review of
00:41:45 Synecdoche New York I think
00:41:47 then like in the next video you can say oh by the way
00:41:49 maybe guys I saw you commenting about this
00:41:51 I got this a little wrong or
00:41:53 I just want to clarify this point
00:41:55 something like that is a very useful tool
00:41:57 I did that in the SAO2 video
00:41:59 I made this pretty glaring mistake
00:42:01 in the original and I corrected it in the sequel
00:42:03 but I also made the defense in that video
00:42:05 that like you know yeah I got this wrong
00:42:07 and I shouldn't have got it wrong
00:42:09 but the point I was making
00:42:11 stands like
00:42:13 it didn't matter that I was wrong about that
00:42:15 in the grand scheme of what I was trying
00:42:17 to say about Kirito
00:42:19 I just think it is such a valuable thing
00:42:21 to like to be able to say that to
00:42:23 to be able to show like I have
00:42:25 seen your arguments on this particular point
00:42:27 and created you know a rebuttal to it
00:42:29 or an opinion and doing like a multi-part series
00:42:31 like that is the perfect way to handle it
00:42:33 I really wish it was easier to like
00:42:35 on YouTube to keep
00:42:37 at it or something
00:42:39 like you can always do
00:42:41 a follow-up video but it's always
00:42:43 going to have way less attention
00:42:45 given to it and like
00:42:47 I mean it's nice to be able
00:42:49 I used to kind of like obsessively
00:42:51 want this but now I've just kind of given up
00:42:53 because I've gotten to that audience size where I just
00:42:55 it's unmanageable
00:42:57 where like if I make a video
00:42:59 that blows up and I make a small mistake
00:43:01 in it and then I were to make a follow-up
00:43:03 video where I correct that small mistake
00:43:05 it's cool that I've
00:43:07 recognized it and that it's out there
00:43:09 and I have my conscience is clean
00:43:11 but the number of people who are actually
00:43:13 going to go find that video
00:43:15 is so much less than the number of people who are just
00:43:17 going to keep commenting on the original about how I fucked up
00:43:19 you know it's like a newspaper retraction
00:43:21 like buried in like the depth of
00:43:23 whatever that says by the way that guy wasn't
00:43:25 the murderer it was the other guy sorry about that
00:43:27 please don't kill that guy to this day
00:43:29 new comments on my first
00:43:31 SAO video come out
00:43:33 that criticized that mistake
00:43:35 you know like yeah of course nobody reads
00:43:37 the comments so there's probably like several hundred
00:43:39 comments about that specific mistake
00:43:41 on that video even though I corrected it
00:43:43 two years ago you know
00:43:45 there's just no there's no victory
00:43:47 with that and so I've kind of given up
00:43:49 like I like to be able to address mistakes
00:43:51 but it's like you know
00:43:53 if you care that much read the fucking comments
00:43:55 cause yeah
00:43:57 yeah there's something to that argument I think
00:43:59 in that specific situation
00:44:01 there's probably just butthurt people who love SAO
00:44:03 so even if you did have a follow up
00:44:05 they wouldn't give you shit anyway so
00:44:07 yeah being butthurt doesn't make your argument invalid
00:44:09 but whatever this alright we've addressed this
00:44:11 I'm sorry Gib we interrupted you
00:44:13 in a big way
00:44:15 oh yeah I guess we're still talking about my stuff
00:44:17 yeah
00:44:19 I guess we could talk about
00:44:21 I have a question that could springboard you into something you can talk about
00:44:23 that we can't interrupt you on because I don't know the reason
00:44:25 I think you've probably addressed this somewhere before
00:44:27 but where did the
00:44:29 idea for the green screen just sitting around
00:44:31 on shit come from
00:44:33 cause that is the fucking coolest
00:44:35 idea
00:44:37 oh hang on you cut out for the idea
00:44:39 oh I think you said the green screen like effects
00:44:41 for a GRPJ and shit
00:44:43 where did you get the idea and just like I'm just gonna throw this on the ground
00:44:45 in a pile
00:44:47 it's fucking great
00:44:49 well I just thought
00:44:51 I mean I wanted to have
00:44:53 the whole thing with the GRPJ
00:44:55 it was supposed to be the least amount of editing
00:44:57 even though it's still quite intensive because I got to cut out all the stuff that I
00:44:59 like you know
00:45:01 the pauses and stuff
00:45:03 but I wanted it to be
00:45:05 as least editing
00:45:07 possible so I thought I'll just film myself
00:45:09 doing the whole thing
00:45:11 there but I thought that would be too boring
00:45:13 so I thought I'll put a thing in the corner
00:45:15 with the game footage
00:45:17 but I also thought I don't want to have to
00:45:19 edit the game footage to be that relevant
00:45:21 and
00:45:23 I didn't really care so I thought
00:45:25 well I'll put a green screen up
00:45:27 but I couldn't find a way to put the green screen up well
00:45:29 so I just threw it in the background
00:45:31 and from then on it became a meme
00:45:33 I'm just now I'm gonna
00:45:35 put things
00:45:37 creative ways you've been using green screen since then
00:45:39 and like other videos
00:45:41 is great
00:45:43 I would say it started before that
00:45:45 because on the give and take channel
00:45:47 then like there's been a long history
00:45:49 of these weird green screen
00:45:51 meme videos but originally
00:45:53 on an actual green screen he would just
00:45:55 remove all the green from
00:45:57 the actual footage
00:45:59 it'd be like him in the grass
00:46:01 outside and then remove all the green from the grass
00:46:03 and put another clip down there
00:46:05 even your rayman video
00:46:07 when you're like oh I'm gonna be rayman
00:46:09 so I just wear green sleeves
00:46:11 and key out my arm
00:46:13 it was fucking great
00:46:15 that was great and not even just
00:46:17 green screens but like your jump cut jack
00:46:19 video is fucking great
00:46:21 just you know it's actually
00:46:23 green screens I actually had a moment
00:46:25 where I watched jump cut jack back the other day
00:46:27 and like realized that
00:46:29 you created a sentence
00:46:31 through all those jump cuts
00:46:33 which means that like every position you got into
00:46:35 you had to say a tiny fragment of a word
00:46:37 right well what I did
00:46:39 I said the whole sentence and then
00:46:41 moved a bit said the whole sentence and then I spliced it
00:46:43 all together oh perfect still genius
00:46:45 I hadn't even thought about like
00:46:47 hey guys jump cut jack
00:46:49 back here with another fucking
00:46:51 video
00:46:53 it's genius
00:46:55 but yeah speaking of
00:46:57 live action we could talk about
00:46:59 the process for that because that is quite a lot
00:47:01 of extra bullshit though
00:47:03 I feel like I'm obliged to do
00:47:05 but I also enjoy doing it because
00:47:07 I can pull funny faces and that's funny
00:47:09 but it's
00:47:11 it's a lot of hassle having a camera and
00:47:13 lighting and getting a
00:47:15 no one understands how much fucking harder
00:47:17 it is to do live action that it is
00:47:19 to do footage and it seems
00:47:21 I mean like okay if it's a vlog that's
00:47:23 easiest thing in the world right turn on some
00:47:25 shitty lights and
00:47:27 point a fucking phone at yourself and record
00:47:29 but like if you're trying to make something look
00:47:31 good then it's not
00:47:33 just a matter of like
00:47:35 lighting yourself you have to
00:47:37 you have to basically become a director
00:47:39 because the lighting also
00:47:41 has to reflect the tone of what you're doing this is the huge
00:47:43 this is the big fucking problem I have with
00:47:45 John Tron like with his modern videos
00:47:47 is that he has like the
00:47:49 high budget set the high budget lighting the high
00:47:51 budget cameras it's all like pristine
00:47:53 and clean and beautiful but the
00:47:55 way that it's lit
00:47:57 is not fun he's making fun
00:47:59 videos with this like dour
00:48:01 cold lighting set
00:48:03 that does not look like a place somebody lives
00:48:05 and it's fucking weird
00:48:07 and like that's and that really detracts
00:48:09 from the comedy because it just feels like what the fuck
00:48:11 why are you on a set why aren't you in your house
00:48:13 playing video games that's what the narrative
00:48:15 is suggesting of the video
00:48:17 you know it's a weird
00:48:19 like it's not quite
00:48:21 awkward enough to be awkward funny
00:48:23 and it's not quite funny enough it's not quite
00:48:25 light-hearted enough to be a video game
00:48:27 romp
00:48:29 it's weird total garbage
00:48:31 and then you watch like hypocrites videos
00:48:33 and it's usually just like natural lighting it seems
00:48:35 like you just open like a curtain yeah
00:48:37 it looks like you're in your room
00:48:39 you know
00:48:41 because I can't really film anywhere else
00:48:43 but yeah the natural lighting
00:48:45 I always try to do that because I don't have
00:48:47 a big old bunch of lights
00:48:49 with stands and stuff so
00:48:53 I usually try to film during the day
00:48:55 when I have the window open and stuff
00:48:57 getting the light in
00:48:59 but for this Rayman video I had
00:49:01 a genius idea that nobody would have picked up on
00:49:03 obviously because I didn't show it
00:49:05 but you see my TV
00:49:07 the big TV on the thing
00:49:09 you might see in certain shots
00:49:11 in certain videos or whatever
00:49:13 and all I did was I got
00:49:15 a 1920 by 1080
00:49:17 picture of
00:49:19 just white
00:49:21 just ffffff white
00:49:23 put it on a USB plug that into the TV
00:49:25 and then just had that be on the TV
00:49:27 just a big white TV
00:49:29 thing and that lit me from the front
00:49:31 as I recorded
00:49:33 hey good thinking I've done stuff like that with
00:49:35 like when I'm recording a vlog I might turn up
00:49:37 the brightness on my monitor all the way
00:49:39 and just have that be like lighting for me
00:49:41 because
00:49:43 my house, my room especially
00:49:45 like even though my room has three windows
00:49:47 getting ffffking like natural lighting
00:49:49 is really hard because just the way the windows
00:49:51 are angled and my room is huge
00:49:53 and I usually film at night
00:49:55 and like lighting this fffking
00:49:57 room is impossible it just
00:49:59 swallows light like we would
00:50:01 do all this stuff and if you watch my older videos
00:50:03 where I had like you know vlogs or had myself
00:50:05 on camera in certain videos if you want to see the worst
00:50:07 look at the lucky star video
00:50:09 that's what happened when I tried to
00:50:11 light myself because
00:50:13 when Victor's around you know he does this
00:50:15 professionally and he'll take three lights
00:50:17 and he'll fffking set him up and he can make something
00:50:19 presentable but like when it's
00:50:21 me by myself trying to light myself
00:50:23 I can't see where the lights are pointing
00:50:25 on me I can't see where I'm
00:50:27 casting shadows I can't see
00:50:29 where you know if the camera is pointing at me
00:50:31 correctly I can't fffking adjust focus
00:50:33 on a DSLR on myself
00:50:35 because I have to lean forward
00:50:37 to adjust the focus and then lean back
00:50:39 I'm doing all that right now
00:50:41 it's fffking it's a huge pain in the ass
00:50:43 and
00:50:45 it sucks ass because it's
00:50:47 always gonna look shit
00:50:49 you can never make it look great
00:50:51 it's just gonna look like acceptable enough
00:50:53 that you can publish it but you can't make it look
00:50:55 great that way
00:50:57 and if you see that fffking lucky star
00:50:59 video it's like every single shot
00:51:01 the lighting is different and terrible
00:51:03 it's all every single one is
00:51:05 in a different bad way
00:51:07 sometimes I'm too blown out sometimes
00:51:09 the shadows are too harsh sometimes the casting shadows
00:51:11 on my face the framing isn't quite right
00:51:13 I just had the camera just out of reach
00:51:15 and that was with shade helping me like I had
00:51:17 someone helping but shade
00:51:19 doesn't know what the fffking is doing you know
00:51:21 so like if you don't have a crew
00:51:23 to help you film live action
00:51:25 segments then just don't
00:51:27 and that's why I don't you know
00:51:29 it's like something really brief or simple
00:51:31 or easy and thankfully my new
00:51:33 phone like can capture
00:51:35 just enough light that like I did a little
00:51:37 live action segment in my you know
00:51:39 high school anime video where it's
00:51:41 that was just filmed on my phone with just
00:51:43 the lighting of my room and it looks fine
00:51:45 because that phone could capture enough
00:51:47 but even in that shot the framing is slightly
00:51:49 off because I had to use the
00:51:51 outward facing camera which I can't look
00:51:53 at I can't see what it's filming
00:51:55 so I just kind of pointed it as best I could
00:51:57 to look at me but you know my chin's
00:51:59 a little too low my head's not quite
00:52:01 at the top of the frame and I'm a fffking
00:52:03 stickler for that stuff so
00:52:05 you know that fffking
00:52:07 a fffking CWC
00:52:09 lecture bended with
00:52:11 you know Victor camera-ing
00:52:13 and doing all the light it looks great
00:52:15 it looks wonderful you know
00:52:17 that was a shot I mean you can see in the three
00:52:19 if you watch the 360 version of that
00:52:21 you can see there's a whole fffking light
00:52:23 set up like there's like three or four lights
00:52:25 professional lights and Victor is
00:52:27 sitting up on a stool with this huge
00:52:29 tripod and this giant fffking camera
00:52:31 rig you know like it's it was
00:52:33 shot professionally
00:52:35 you gotta have a lot of patience to be a
00:52:37 cameraman just fffking sit there and watch
00:52:39 that's why I can't even do it like
00:52:41 nobody wants to watch you talk about
00:52:43 anime for ten minutes in your room
00:52:45 you know speaking of
00:52:47 cameras
00:52:49 I film all my stuff
00:52:51 on a camcorder and it's mostly
00:52:53 because I can turn the screen around and flip
00:52:55 so I can adjust myself see how I look
00:52:57 and I know I know Nate
00:52:59 you have a problem with this because you use a DSLR
00:53:01 dude let me just tell you I might the fffking
00:53:03 I can't remember the word again
00:53:05 I used my shitty DSLR doesn't
00:53:07 have a flip around you should have seen the fffking
00:53:09 process I went through like an hour of that
00:53:11 time was just focusing getting back
00:53:13 filming a little bit running back
00:53:15 watching it see if it was focused adjusting
00:53:17 doing it repeat that process for fffking hour
00:53:19 but I got it eventually what camera
00:53:21 I'll tell you afterward I don't know
00:53:23 a piece of shit that I don't like
00:53:25 it's like a rebel T2I right
00:53:27 I have a T2I right now
00:53:29 and I have found a way to solve this
00:53:31 problem very simply it will cost you
00:53:33 six dollars and you can fix this problem
00:53:35 let a stand up mirror
00:53:37 shop after this
00:53:39 it's fffking great
00:53:41 wait was it a stand up mirror
00:53:43 is that the six dollars solution
00:53:45 I mean that's one you could do too but I have another
00:53:47 I'll talk about when I talk about my video stuff
00:53:49 okay cool yeah great great
00:53:51 but yeah the you can
00:53:53 tell my camcorder quality camera
00:53:55 is not that great and I
00:53:57 could be using my dad's DSLR
00:53:59 because he doesn't use it that much
00:54:01 but you know I always choose
00:54:03 practicality for shooting over
00:54:05 the quality because when I record
00:54:07 my camera my camcorder is really terrible
00:54:09 for low light so when I usually
00:54:11 try to record it's during the day
00:54:13 and I only have a few hours especially in winter
00:54:15 when the days are shorter and I wake
00:54:17 up late and I'm like okay I got to do all this
00:54:19 I got to set up my mic just out of shot
00:54:21 so that it can pick up my audio
00:54:23 because my camera audio is terrible
00:54:25 I have to have that there and I have to
00:54:27 do the performances I have to do them over
00:54:29 and over again to get them right and I'm not
00:54:31 ever entirely sure how good they
00:54:33 are until I'm done oh and
00:54:35 my computer fffking my computer fan
00:54:37 is really loud you might be able to hear it
00:54:39 in my audio right now but
00:54:41 every time I record something
00:54:43 either just voice over
00:54:45 all my live action I have to turn my computer off
00:54:47 get my laptop out and put it on the other
00:54:49 side of the room and then plug in the things
00:54:51 from there so that there's no noise
00:54:53 and it's just like
00:54:55 20-30 minutes of setting up just to do
00:54:57 like 5 or 6 small takes and then move
00:54:59 the camera do a few more
00:55:01 it's a bitch I think your live
00:55:03 action segments come out great
00:55:05 because and that's what
00:55:07 I want to emphasize to the audience here is like
00:55:09 yeah Gibbons using a shittier camera
00:55:11 but you're using like Z optimal
00:55:13 circumstances for it and that takes
00:55:15 patience and time
00:55:17 it's like you can only film
00:55:19 during these hours of the day
00:55:21 during this certain time and like and also you
00:55:23 can't you know you couldn't film
00:55:25 like multiple takes of the same like let's say
00:55:27 you filmed uh like you saying
00:55:29 half a sentence and then hour later said
00:55:31 the other half the sun's in a different place
00:55:33 it looks totally different you know like you can't
00:55:35 fuck around too much with this stuff
00:55:37 and like yeah so the reason
00:55:39 Hippo is able to have stuff that still
00:55:41 looks good in spite of the equipment is
00:55:43 that patience that I don't have
00:55:45 because for me everything has to be like
00:55:47 instantaneous I need this video Don it has to be
00:55:49 on my desk by Tuesday I have to just
00:55:51 film it in the shit conditions I have
00:55:53 you know for all the videos
00:55:55 that I film in my
00:55:57 my cabin garage thing at the end
00:55:59 of the gun where you can see the drumset and all
00:56:01 that um that's
00:56:03 all like I have to stay down there for
00:56:05 2-3 hours because like
00:56:07 the Harry Potter one I do a lot of skits the
00:56:09 Jack and Daxter what all all those
00:56:11 things I do a lot of skits as well as
00:56:13 doing a lot of like talking to the camera
00:56:15 which I don't do anymore I tried not to do
00:56:17 any live action where I'm just speaking
00:56:19 because there's no point it has to be
00:56:21 either a skit or like a cutaway
00:56:23 gag to a visual of me doing a funny face
00:56:25 anything else is too
00:56:27 is too like there's
00:56:29 no reason for me to record that because it's just extra
00:56:31 work right and the hardest
00:56:33 thing is is not just
00:56:35 getting it all done but like trying to get it all
00:56:37 done at once because that's I can't
00:56:39 really do it the next day and if I do
00:56:41 it's sort of weird so I've got to do
00:56:43 everything in one go
00:56:45 and it's
00:56:47 hard to keep your voice going and to keep
00:56:49 energized and I'm like
00:56:51 by the end god like trying to match
00:56:53 a later voiceover with one you did
00:56:55 oh yeah it's impossible
00:56:59 that's that goes for voiceovers too I try
00:57:01 to do them all in one go and sometimes
00:57:03 my voice is not noticeably
00:57:05 like
00:57:07 haggard by the end of it and you might be able to
00:57:09 tell in some videos where I'm like
00:57:11 but I kept that in anyway because
00:57:13 I can't be bullet to do it again
00:57:15 because you're a goddamn professional
00:57:17 how many takes do you usually
00:57:19 like do you have to do multiple
00:57:21 takes on most lines or would you say it's like
00:57:23 only occasionally like
00:57:25 do you usually get through the whole thing in one sitting
00:57:27 well I usually
00:57:29 get through the whole thing in one sitting but I the
00:57:31 sittings are very long and how much longer
00:57:33 is the recording than what
00:57:35 the video is
00:57:37 let me think
00:57:39 I mean I do multiple takes
00:57:41 for every line at least one other take
00:57:43 just in case the first one wasn't bad
00:57:45 was bad sometimes I don't do
00:57:47 multiple takes and the take I thought was alright
00:57:49 doesn't actually sound good
00:57:51 and I'm like I hate me
00:57:53 but I mean I know Jesse
00:57:55 records like hours for each of his
00:57:57 yeah it's I mean for that
00:57:59 Rayman thing I'm trying to think
00:58:01 I mean the the session was like two and a half
00:58:03 hours but that was for part two as well
00:58:05 right so
00:58:07 it's it's a lot of extra time like
00:58:09 it's a ten minute video is probably like 45
00:58:11 minutes to an hour of
00:58:13 of doing the recording
00:58:15 Nate how about you
00:58:17 I definitely don't
00:58:19 do every line like I feel
00:58:21 like I have a pretty good sense for if I fucked up a line
00:58:23 and like if
00:58:25 I'm just going through I try to do the whole thing
00:58:27 in just one take and don't really worry if I got it right
00:58:29 if I did it wrong I'll just repeat the line
00:58:31 and then just place it in later and then like
00:58:33 I'm more inclined to try to get the thing
00:58:35 done reasonably good and then if there's
00:58:37 a problem after I put in Vegas and I'm editing
00:58:39 then I'll just do it over yeah usually what I
00:58:41 do is if I think the first
00:58:43 half of a paragraph I say is okay
00:58:45 and I find like I
00:58:47 like I mess up the second half I find
00:58:49 I think of the area where I could
00:58:51 splice in a second take of the second
00:58:53 half and then I just say that part
00:58:55 again instead of I do that too I
00:58:57 mean I definitely don't think
00:58:59 my method could work for Hippo because
00:59:01 your comedy is so much
00:59:03 about line delivery and it's like
00:59:05 there's so many moments in that Rayman
00:59:07 video where it's just the way you say a word
00:59:09 makes me fucking laugh what's the
00:59:11 eggplant but the other word for it
00:59:13 aubergine
00:59:15 what the fuck is an aubergine is that an eggplant
00:59:17 yes
00:59:19 well what the fuck why don't you say eggplant
00:59:21 because I'm not an American you
00:59:23 crazy boy
00:59:25 the machine sounds way funnier when you're
00:59:27 implying it also sounds French so
00:59:29 it's just like the British word or like
00:59:31 the European word for it or something
00:59:33 it's just the word that non-Americans say I think
00:59:35 man
00:59:37 like for me you're an inferior
00:59:39 race my recordings are usually
00:59:41 at most like two to five minutes
00:59:43 longer than the actual
00:59:45 video like it's just any
00:59:47 if I stumble over a line
00:59:49 I redo it but it's immediate it's just like
00:59:51 this time I was
00:59:53 wait this time I was
00:59:55 you know like
00:59:57 there are some lines that will stop me up
00:59:59 for a good 30 seconds or something
01:00:01 there's some little tongue twisters in my
01:00:03 scripts but it's all one go
01:00:05 and recently when I did
01:00:07 because there's five videos I have coming out
01:00:09 in November all of them being edited by DeVue
01:00:11 I've written them all before November started
01:00:13 wait five are coming out in November it's already
01:00:15 halfway through dog
01:00:17 alright there's already two out
01:00:19 oh I thought you meant they were all coming
01:00:21 no no no five total and
01:00:23 I had written them all before November and
01:00:25 like I had them all sitting there and I just
01:00:27 literally went into my closet
01:00:29 for two and a half hours and recorded all five
01:00:31 of them in one session so
01:00:33 if you listen to these five videos back to back
01:00:35 you'll notice my voice sounds the same in all of them
01:00:37 which is not normal usually I sound kind of
01:00:39 different in each video this one is just like
01:00:41 I fucking just
01:00:43 belted them out one after another and by the end
01:00:45 I was dead
01:00:47 yeah I really wish I could do that
01:00:49 yeah
01:00:51 but I don't think it would work for you
01:00:53 because it's the comedy would not
01:00:55 come through you know unless you
01:00:57 I love doing the uh
01:00:59 I love doing the script recording I just
01:01:01 wish that I produced scripts faster that I
01:01:03 could record and then do shit with
01:01:05 yeah it's always got it's always feels so good
01:01:07 getting getting a script done
01:01:09 is hell and I feel
01:01:11 great when I put the video when I record it
01:01:13 put it into Vegas and I start
01:01:15 to edit I'm like yes this is what I
01:01:17 was born to do being the editing process
01:01:19 and then of course a month later when I'm only
01:01:21 halfway through editing the thing I wish I was dead but
01:01:23 you know yeah
01:01:25 the way I do the editing
01:01:27 usually like I said I don't do the music
01:01:29 first I do the music last
01:01:31 what I do is I get my audio put it in
01:01:33 obviously and I put that that blue
01:01:35 background on and I basically
01:01:37 I cut every section where there's a live
01:01:39 action bit and you know
01:01:41 space them out really far and then I
01:01:43 just go through it
01:01:45 and then
01:01:47 first I put like the game footage
01:01:49 and then I leave like editing bits with
01:01:51 images and stuff for later
01:01:53 so I've got all the game footage and then
01:01:55 that's like the skeleton of everything the
01:01:57 skeleton of the review that's the
01:01:59 timings that it's going to be
01:02:01 not always though
01:02:03 I can see why you like making videos if it
01:02:05 involves skeletons
01:02:07 yes
01:02:09 the backbone
01:02:11 rattle rattle
01:02:13 first and then live action
01:02:15 and once everything is in place where
01:02:17 it's like I can reasonably say
01:02:19 this video is going to be a certain number of minutes long
01:02:21 then I will start
01:02:23 properly going over it I don't usually
01:02:25 do that I've tried to start
01:02:27 doing that like I'm usually I would
01:02:29 just go and do the finished
01:02:31 thing
01:02:33 but now I'm trying to
01:02:35 do like a first draft of the thing so
01:02:37 I go through it and I finish it
01:02:39 and then I know it's not done so I go over
01:02:41 it again and all that
01:02:43 yeah that's reasonable
01:02:45 yeah you know this highlights I think
01:02:47 a difference in the way I've seen Hippo
01:02:49 and Nate's editing based
01:02:51 on screenshots of their Vegas
01:02:53 timelines is that you guys
01:02:55 I believe just put in the full
01:02:57 recording of your narration and then
01:02:59 edit the audio as you go
01:03:01 true is that true yeah no I
01:03:03 edit the thing in
01:03:05 audacity and then if I need to
01:03:07 add pauses or
01:03:09 cut things out then I will edit
01:03:11 it in Vegas. I just remember seeing a screenshot
01:03:13 of one of your timelines and
01:03:15 the audio track had tons of cuts
01:03:17 constantly was that just you adjusting
01:03:19 for timing are you sure that was me
01:03:21 I'm not sure I saw one of you
01:03:23 but maybe not maybe I just
01:03:25 I saw Nate I thought it was you for one time
01:03:27 I mean I know that
01:03:29 I do eventually cut
01:03:31 the audio a lot but like
01:03:33 I just just to move
01:03:35 it around a bit like if I feel like this
01:03:37 this joke needs like
01:03:39 half a second of
01:03:41 quiet after it I will cut it there
01:03:43 and maybe it looks like a lot
01:03:45 I don't know the way I remember
01:03:47 ever posting my Vegas timeline
01:03:49 the way I do audio is like
01:03:51 you know I recorded an audacity
01:03:53 then I remove all the gaps and all the
01:03:55 mistakes and then it's just like this tightly
01:03:57 grouped thing that I put it in Vegas
01:03:59 and I add gaps back into it
01:04:01 then I like once it's all perfectly
01:04:03 formulated then I you know render that
01:04:05 and then put the full file in
01:04:07 and the reason is that I
01:04:09 I have a tendency I want everything to be
01:04:11 like as as unbroken as possible
01:04:13 because it's so easy to fucking
01:04:15 misplace things and move them around
01:04:17 without realizing it and then
01:04:19 you know then you've already made
01:04:21 a hundred more edits and saved
01:04:23 and you don't know what happened to that
01:04:25 audio file that was accidentally grouped
01:04:27 with some clip you deleted
01:04:29 and did you know I gotta
01:04:31 say you don't you use
01:04:33 Vegas still right yeah
01:04:35 for the for things like that
01:04:37 you could open a new Vegas
01:04:39 file and then drag
01:04:41 the old Vegas file into the new one
01:04:43 and then it will just be a continuous
01:04:45 thing so you won't have to render it at all
01:04:47 what do you mean exactly
01:04:49 oh like if you do the audio
01:04:51 editing adding the pauses in one Vegas file
01:04:53 and you drag that file into another
01:04:55 a new Vegas file it will become
01:04:57 a street like a single chunk of audio
01:04:59 yes in a premiere that is known
01:05:01 as sub sequences and
01:05:03 nested projects that is what I do as well
01:05:05 yeah I know Davoo's way
01:05:07 into sub sequences I need to do that
01:05:09 shit with Vegas because like I you know
01:05:11 what I do instead and this is retarded I should just
01:05:13 be this is why I need to use premiere it just is not
01:05:15 working with my fucking drivers I need to
01:05:17 re-steal it from the internet instead
01:05:19 of that I will like I'll take all the
01:05:21 I'll take the keyframes on like
01:05:23 two different tracks and I will just have
01:05:25 them be the exact same keyframes
01:05:27 between all the tracks and then sometimes
01:05:29 there's gonna be like ten fucking things
01:05:31 moving and that need to like expand
01:05:33 or like glide along a path
01:05:35 it's retarded it's the worst idea
01:05:37 okay well like if there's two things on the
01:05:39 screen and they need to move in the same way
01:05:41 what you should do is have them be part of
01:05:43 the same sub sequence and then animate that
01:05:45 sub sequence in a particular way
01:05:47 but what I've been doing instead for the longest
01:05:49 time just because Vegas doesn't make it easy
01:05:51 to do it the other way is I just
01:05:53 will keyframe those two with
01:05:55 the exact same keyframes you know so
01:05:57 moving together that you could make a sub
01:05:59 sequence to do that
01:06:01 well you know a Gibbs dad discovered it one day
01:06:05 I've recently learned
01:06:07 the I don't
01:06:09 I don't know why they're called not called sub sequences
01:06:11 maybe something else but nesting if you right
01:06:13 click a bunch of video and premiere
01:06:15 and you right right click
01:06:17 and there's a menu and you click nest
01:06:19 it flattens it all down into another
01:06:21 sequence what you can
01:06:23 holy shit yeah you just highlight it
01:06:25 right click nest and it becomes
01:06:27 its own video file that include
01:06:29 if you double click on that it goes to
01:06:31 all the files that you just squashed
01:06:33 and then you can move that
01:06:35 it's probably the same
01:06:37 thing but oh my god
01:06:39 alright and then you can move that as its own
01:06:41 thing what hippo just described is exactly
01:06:43 like what subsequences already are
01:06:45 so yeah you have
01:06:47 I know I know I've used premiere and I use
01:06:49 subsequences I just didn't know that existed
01:06:51 in Vegas but this is
01:06:53 I'm talking about premiere
01:06:55 oh well fuck it never mind
01:06:59 yeah no everything
01:07:01 for me I don't do anything fancy
01:07:03 within the events that I do
01:07:05 edit but like the reason that subsequence
01:07:07 thing with the audio wouldn't help me is that I
01:07:09 send all my completed audio files to DeVoo
01:07:11 and he edits it around
01:07:13 so yeah and he
01:07:15 usually doesn't do anything to the audio
01:07:17 it's just like a purely the unbroken track
01:07:19 unless I have to request something like
01:07:21 with the Kuroko no Basket
01:07:23 video where we later added in like chapter
01:07:25 headers and just had to split
01:07:27 all those up but I'm so fucking particular
01:07:29 about audio and
01:07:31 I'm teaching myself
01:07:33 to care less about audio
01:07:35 but at the same time it keeps getting more
01:07:37 complicated because like you know I've got
01:07:39 all this fucking great audio equipment
01:07:41 and I surround myself with it and I
01:07:43 criticize people on their audio and I'm like
01:07:45 I really want it to be perfect because
01:07:47 I listen to everything through
01:07:49 speakers through like a pretty good
01:07:51 set of speakers and I can
01:07:53 tell massively the difference
01:07:55 between audio quality of different things
01:07:57 but people who are on shitty speakers
01:07:59 can't and like Ben
01:08:01 had no idea
01:08:03 that his audio was worse than everyone else's
01:08:05 on the PCP he legitimately
01:08:07 did not know really yeah he had no idea
01:08:09 oh god so
01:08:11 all this time I failed as a father you know
01:08:13 he sounded like a tin can because he just
01:08:15 listens to it there was laptop speakers you know
01:08:17 or like the headphones he uses which are like
01:08:19 fucking stock
01:08:21 like iPod headphones
01:08:23 so
01:08:25 he's listening to it in garbage quality audio
01:08:27 so everyone sounds just as shitty
01:08:29 and but that's how like most people
01:08:31 do like most people don't have a nice
01:08:33 set of studio monitors or a
01:08:35 fucking $150 pair of headphones
01:08:37 most people are either listening to it like
01:08:39 on their cell phone or their laptop
01:08:41 and so like that's why so many people
01:08:43 can get away with having such shitty audio
01:08:45 like you know Jimquisition doesn't feel the need
01:08:47 to update his fucking audio quality
01:08:49 or movie Bob or something because
01:08:51 it's never been a problem for enough people
01:08:53 and like I've kind of
01:08:55 learned to accept that but then
01:08:57 fucking god damn like
01:08:59 because it used to be that
01:09:01 I wouldn't do vlogs because I had to set up
01:09:03 my fucking microphone you know it's like such
01:09:05 a pain in the ass to have the microphone just off screen
01:09:07 and but like you don't want it to be
01:09:09 intrusive in the video but then it's also
01:09:11 just a pain to set it up and all that it's like I just want to be able
01:09:13 to touch and go so I had my
01:09:15 Galaxy Note 3 and
01:09:17 that thing I was using the
01:09:19 inward-facing camera which looks like dog shit
01:09:21 but the fucking microphone
01:09:23 was on the inside so it sounded
01:09:25 decent and it has pretty good
01:09:27 like it kind of auto compresses
01:09:29 the audio so it actually sounds
01:09:31 pretty good comparatively
01:09:33 so I used that for all these vlogs
01:09:35 and stuff and then I upgraded
01:09:37 to the
01:09:39 you know first I had the Note 7 had to replace
01:09:41 that now I got the S7 Edge this
01:09:43 thing has a much better front facing
01:09:45 camera but the fucking microphone
01:09:47 is on the outside
01:09:49 and it records in stereo
01:09:51 and you can never whether you're recording
01:09:53 inside or outside you can never
01:09:55 have the audio levels of the left and right channel
01:09:57 be equal so the left channel will be
01:09:59 super loud and the right channel
01:10:01 will be super quiet so what I've been
01:10:03 having to do is then
01:10:05 like I put the whole file into Vegas
01:10:07 and then I'll split it into left
01:10:09 and right and then
01:10:11 because you can't do that in Vegas so I have to
01:10:13 render it as a WAV put it in audacity
01:10:15 split the left and right track make the left track
01:10:17 mono put that like render that
01:10:19 put that into Vegas this doesn't
01:10:21 take long it's just a pain in the ass
01:10:23 are you sure there isn't a setting to record
01:10:25 the audio in just mono
01:10:27 there's nothing like that on the phone I mean that's not normal
01:10:29 like mono recording
01:10:31 is mostly for high-end devices
01:10:33 it's not normal for stuff to even
01:10:35 offer that so which is fucking
01:10:37 sucks and it's just bizarre
01:10:39 yeah well it's funny too because I always
01:10:41 thought on the old phone I thought it was
01:10:43 weird that the microphone was on the front
01:10:45 facing camera because it seemed obvious
01:10:47 that you're mostly going to be filming other stuff
01:10:49 not yourself because most people are vloggers
01:10:51 this is the selfie age my friend you're going to be
01:10:53 filming yourself 100% of the time so now it's
01:10:55 just weird they put it on the other side instead
01:10:57 but like it sucks for me because
01:10:59 that audio will sound like dog shit
01:11:01 when I mix it that way like it you know
01:11:03 it's even worse than it would have been so
01:11:05 now I'm like well I guess I gotta
01:11:07 fucking hook up the microphone every time I want to do a
01:11:09 vlog again which thankfully I have a much longer
01:11:11 XLR cable than I used to so that's not
01:11:13 as much of a pain but
01:11:15 yeah that's like
01:11:17 it's just such a nightmare to do anything
01:11:19 why is everything
01:11:21 so hard
01:11:23 yeah that's
01:11:25 what it comes down to
01:11:27 so where were we
01:11:29 I was gonna
01:11:31 talk about
01:11:33 because we know the process
01:11:35 we have like what we do
01:11:37 but there's always that moment where we're like
01:11:39 I don't know what the fuck I'm doing
01:11:41 I'm stuck I don't know what I don't
01:11:43 feel like I know what I'm doing right now
01:11:45 and I try to alleviate that by writing
01:11:47 in the script ahead of time how I should
01:11:49 edit some parts or how I should
01:11:51 record some live
01:11:53 action bits like
01:11:55 like extensive notes like so that there's
01:11:57 no way that I could interpret it in
01:11:59 properly like two weeks later
01:12:01 when I'm actually doing stuff
01:12:03 but
01:12:05 there's always that moment where you're like
01:12:07 I
01:12:09 like
01:12:11 there's usually a process that you have to
01:12:13 come up with to get out of that or to just
01:12:15 keep going and for me
01:12:17 I don't really have one yet
01:12:19 some people they can find out ways to
01:12:21 like
01:12:23 just do stuff
01:12:25 when they don't know what they're doing
01:12:27 the most dangerous thing you can do in a moment
01:12:29 is like start a new video that you're interested
01:12:31 in and then you got two and like oh no
01:12:33 I never start another
01:12:35 well actually I do sometimes
01:12:37 make like a video that
01:12:39 hair thing that Voldemorty video
01:12:41 I made that because I just had an idea
01:12:43 the best thing you've ever made it's a sensation
01:12:45 it's got 11,000 views somehow
01:12:47 holy shit
01:12:49 yes
01:12:51 I just thought oh wouldn't it be
01:12:53 cool if I could turn my head into my heads
01:12:55 there while I was editing Rayman
01:12:57 so I just put Rayman on hold
01:12:59 I filmed it in five minutes
01:13:01 I put it up and I'm like okay now
01:13:03 back to editing I'm like wait a minute
01:13:05 no I should do something else I should
01:13:07 look at all my
01:13:09 all the comments in every single thing I've ever
01:13:11 ever made
01:13:13 you go down that rabbit hole but
01:13:15 why would you ever do that
01:13:17 I'm glad I have too many videos for that to even
01:13:19 be slightly viable
01:13:21 oh yeah every time I go to my
01:13:23 notifications there's like oh
01:13:25 there's a brand new comment on give and take
01:13:27 I better look at it
01:13:29 we're not over that hill yet we will one day
01:13:31 but right now
01:13:33 two years gone on a notification bell
01:13:35 but yeah
01:13:37 I really wish
01:13:39 it was easy to just keep
01:13:41 editing because sometimes you get on a roll
01:13:43 and it's great but a lot of the time
01:13:45 I'm not on a roll I'm just sort of like
01:13:47 forcing myself to get to a certain
01:13:49 point before the end of the day like I've been
01:13:51 writing on a pad of paper in front of me
01:13:53 every time I get to
01:13:55 today I was like okay
01:13:57 get to the two minute mark
01:13:59 of the Rayman part two and I'm almost there
01:14:01 but things came up
01:14:03 but every day I would
01:14:05 like okay I did that cross it off
01:14:07 now get to the five minute mark and I would just
01:14:09 that's kind of
01:14:11 helpful but sometimes I just
01:14:13 don't do it
01:14:15 with that whole getting stuck at parts
01:14:17 that's the period where I'll
01:14:19 just get up and go do something
01:14:21 I don't have a smoke or
01:14:23 fucking just do anything
01:14:25 to help me
01:14:27 you know jog my brain
01:14:29 and think of something that'll go there
01:14:31 what I usually do at the moment is
01:14:33 I've been going on pokemon go walks
01:14:35 with my brother
01:14:37 and it's been nice because it's autumn and the leaves
01:14:39 are falling and it's really beautiful
01:14:41 did you pokemon go to the poles
01:14:43 but I can't because I'm English
01:14:45 I'm English I'd voted
01:14:47 for trumpy spirit
01:14:49 now
01:14:51 Hippo are you about wrapped up with yours
01:14:53 you've been going for like 50 minutes now
01:14:55 can I quickly just bring up
01:14:57 a quick just say a problem I have
01:14:59 to selfishly bring up a problem that's different
01:15:01 from that that I have is that I constantly
01:15:03 running up to it's the end of the night
01:15:05 I now need to stop my productive
01:15:07 work and go to sleep so I can get up for my
01:15:09 wage slave job what I'm trying to say
01:15:11 is people help me help me
01:15:13 go to patreon.com
01:15:15 save me from this fucking life
01:15:17 I just want to make my videos and I know
01:15:19 you want them too so help me
01:15:21 that's my biggest problem in the world right now
01:15:23 okay moving on
01:15:25 Tom let's hear your writing and editing
01:15:27 process
01:15:29 if you can do debu first I'm like
01:15:31 and speaking of wage slave jobs I had to start
01:15:33 around to my job so all my audio is just going to echo
01:15:35 like fuck on an old abandoned building
01:15:37 it's fair enough
01:15:39 if you're still even here
01:15:41 yeah debu let's have you go for it
01:15:43 okay well you know in order to make a good
01:15:45 video you got to be at your computer
01:15:47 in order to be at your computer you got to sit
01:15:49 down or stand up or have some sort of pose
01:15:51 right now it used to be
01:15:53 I had like an office chair
01:15:55 that was like really old
01:15:57 like it was an old office chair from like the early 90s
01:15:59 and it just got so much it turned
01:16:01 them into such a concave
01:16:03 that my back was just hell
01:16:05 sitting in it so I had this other more
01:16:07 low-end office chair that
01:16:09 was okay but as the years
01:16:11 went on it just made my back
01:16:13 ache so much and what
01:16:15 a fascinating thing it is that you would interpret
01:16:17 this question to be addressing your
01:16:19 seating situation in terms of
01:16:21 how you make videos I'm sorry but please
01:16:23 go on yeah so
01:16:25 you know eventually I basically just gave up
01:16:27 on chairs all together there's really no chair
01:16:29 that's not going to make my
01:16:31 back hurt eventually unless it's a
01:16:33 $600 one like what did you
01:16:35 has but I haven't even tried that one out extensively
01:16:37 you know so like
01:16:39 in my room where I am right now
01:16:41 where I edit more
01:16:43 all of my like Saturn videos
01:16:45 or anything that's like easy
01:16:47 you know I just don't
01:16:49 have a chair I just sit on the floor
01:16:51 my computer is mounted on
01:16:53 my computer like
01:16:55 my monitor is on
01:16:57 my computer tower with a couple
01:16:59 of books stacked up to get it just
01:17:01 at the right height relative to my head
01:17:03 where's your keyboard though
01:17:05 well the keyboards either on the floor
01:17:07 or on my lap and I have a little
01:17:09 box where I put the mouse on
01:17:11 okay right now I have
01:17:13 said box then with more
01:17:15 boxes and then my microphone
01:17:17 stand which my microphone
01:17:19 is on in front of my face right now
01:17:21 so I use
01:17:23 boxes I don't use chairs or tables
01:17:25 I have one token
01:17:27 table in this room
01:17:29 that I put some things on but everything
01:17:31 else is on the floor a token
01:17:33 table in a room like cheese okay
01:17:35 yeah alright he had to have a table
01:17:37 in the room we all know that's a fucking
01:17:39 unnecessary right
01:17:41 watching all of this anime the weaveness
01:17:43 has been slowly creeping up into my mind
01:17:45 and I've found myself just sitting on the floor
01:17:47 yeah yeah like a fucking animal
01:17:49 in the other room in the like
01:17:51 living room area where the
01:17:53 where the advanced computer is which is
01:17:55 good for editing and has high power
01:17:57 and such you know I
01:17:59 I messed around with different seating
01:18:01 positions but then eventually
01:18:03 I I scooted
01:18:05 up this one like piece
01:18:07 of a couch how deep
01:18:09 are we going down this rabbit hole
01:18:11 that belongs to
01:18:13 Digi's family like they
01:18:15 Digi's family has this awesome
01:18:17 couch that has like 17 million
01:18:19 parts to it all of them are
01:18:21 excruciatingly comfortable right
01:18:23 if you go to the
01:18:25 the PCP 360 podcast
01:18:27 we're sitting on all of that
01:18:29 like Jesse and Nate and hippo
01:18:31 I believe all
01:18:33 sorry bed is coming into my room
01:18:35 fascinating they all
01:18:37 slept on those couches
01:18:39 right for a week
01:18:41 and it only started to get uncomfortable for them
01:18:43 eventually
01:18:45 so and I myself will sleep on that
01:18:47 if I want to like if I
01:18:49 am in the heat of editing a thing
01:18:51 and don't want to feel like I can take a break
01:18:53 and go to my room I'll just sleep on that couch
01:18:55 because it's close to
01:18:57 to my computer to my advanced
01:18:59 computer and
01:19:01 there's one little wedge of that couch
01:19:03 that was like in a totally different
01:19:05 section of the room that was close
01:19:07 to where my computer ended up being
01:19:09 and so I slided that little wedge
01:19:11 over and I sat on
01:19:13 that and you would think
01:19:15 that a couch piece would be
01:19:17 not good for editing video
01:19:19 but the the fortitude
01:19:21 of this material was such
01:19:23 that I could just like sit like
01:19:25 on the edge of it like a stool
01:19:27 and it would always be pushing me forward
01:19:29 and just such a way
01:19:31 that it gives me like the perfect
01:19:33 back position
01:19:35 without having to like force it to do
01:19:37 I'm sorry to interrupt but I mean we've got to also cover
01:19:39 like the floor situation like the table
01:19:41 situation I mean can we spend all this
01:19:43 time on chairs there's a lot of furniture
01:19:45 we need to address before you're done
01:19:47 let's chair
01:19:49 well I understand that
01:19:51 I mean it is important to be comfortable
01:19:53 it helps the process
01:19:55 because for me I mean there's a reason
01:19:57 why I've bought all this expensive
01:19:59 fucking furniture like
01:20:01 I sit in a $500 chair
01:20:03 I have a nice like a mattress
01:20:05 because when you
01:20:07 when you have to edit for 8 hours
01:20:09 in a day and your fucking
01:20:11 back starts hurting it is
01:20:13 just makes the whole process worse so
01:20:15 yeah comfort is important
01:20:17 right now I mean
01:20:19 I'm getting sort of the sense that this whole
01:20:21 chair discussion is not
01:20:23 like what you guys were expecting and I did
01:20:25 have more to say about the wedge
01:20:27 but if you want me to move on
01:20:29 it's perfectly fine
01:20:31 it's not a big deal
01:20:33 I mean it doesn't matter that this wedge has
01:20:35 improved my life exponentially
01:20:37 let's move on to like the more relevant thing
01:20:39 of course
01:20:41 so okay
01:20:43 I don't know what you guys are thinking about
01:20:45 the creation of videos I could talk about
01:20:47 the chime in on the whole audio recording
01:20:49 thing I have always
01:20:51 hated doing the audio recording
01:20:53 I mean I love the idea of doing it
01:20:55 but it never comes out right
01:20:57 I always get very frustrated
01:20:59 any amount of frustration I have
01:21:01 will ruin my line delivery
01:21:03 if I get too anxious
01:21:05 and I get short of breath
01:21:07 and it ruins it which just
01:21:09 creates a downward snowball spiral
01:21:11 in which it gets worse and worse
01:21:13 in which I have to attain a zen like
01:21:15 mental state to recover from it
01:21:17 and if I do an attempt
01:21:19 of a recording too many times
01:21:21 it's going to be ruined forever
01:21:23 I'll never be able to deliver it naturally
01:21:25 so I have a limited number of attempts available to me
01:21:27 I do not know how people like Jesse
01:21:29 are able to do so many attempts
01:21:31 and eventually come out with something perfect every time
01:21:33 he always does
01:21:35 he's able to channel his rage into these things I think
01:21:37 I guess so yeah
01:21:39 he said that like usually it's just
01:21:41 he kind of goes
01:21:43 it's not that he goes until he gets the one he likes
01:21:45 it's that he just goes and goes and goes until he's sick of it
01:21:47 and then often he'll pick like one of the first two takes
01:21:49 yeah it only works
01:21:51 with those two because you know you're about to do a hundred more
01:21:53 so you're able to do it with such
01:21:55 naturalistic motions
01:21:57 and you know it's interesting for the last several
01:21:59 videos I made that are like full on
01:22:01 scripts
01:22:03 it's pretty much always three attempts
01:22:05 it's like the first attempt is just to
01:22:07 start programming the rhythm
01:22:09 and delivery into my mind
01:22:11 then I listen to it and hate it and throw it away
01:22:13 then do another one which is like
01:22:15 too unnatural because I'm a little bit tensed up
01:22:17 then
01:22:19 I snap myself
01:22:21 and I break
01:22:23 and then in that broken state
01:22:25 with the broken brilliance rather as you might call it
01:22:27 I am able to do a third attempt which is
01:22:29 more acceptable
01:22:31 is that done for every line or like for the whole
01:22:33 script? no no no I go through the whole thing
01:22:35 once, twice, then the third time
01:22:37 yeah important thing to talk about
01:22:39 that me and DeVu sort of discovered
01:22:41 once I started getting him to edit
01:22:43 is that
01:22:45 one of the things I've been having DeVu do is
01:22:47 like edit these scripts that I wrote ages
01:22:49 ago that like I just
01:22:51 never got around to making the full video
01:22:53 because either I thought it would be too much
01:22:55 effort or I just like
01:22:57 I didn't finish it because I knew it would
01:22:59 be too much effort so for instance
01:23:01 like the Yakiuki Shinbo in the 90s video
01:23:03 like most of part one was
01:23:05 written last November
01:23:07 or so and then like I kind
01:23:09 of finished it up recently and what I found
01:23:11 is that if I sit
01:23:13 on a script for too long
01:23:15 I have no idea how to read it anymore
01:23:17 because you're a different person
01:23:19 well it's like when I'm writing
01:23:21 a script I have a certain
01:23:23 rhythm that I'm reading it back
01:23:25 to myself in you know like I know
01:23:27 the rhythm of the post as it's going
01:23:29 and yeah it's based on
01:23:31 whatever my writing voice is at the time
01:23:33 whatever kind of thing
01:23:35 I do then and I
01:23:37 don't know what that is anymore
01:23:39 that's kind of what makes me think that
01:23:41 he's got a backlog of tons of scripts but I don't
01:23:43 think he's ever going to make any of them
01:23:45 just because he's no longer the man who wrote them
01:23:47 and doesn't care anymore
01:23:49 and I mean a lot of them are he rewrites
01:23:51 you know in like insight doing a different
01:23:53 video about the same subject I mean he's
01:23:55 mentioned that he's written like 15 different
01:23:57 Evangelion videos over time
01:23:59 he keeps trying to do it
01:24:01 but never you know feeling right
01:24:03 about it but yeah
01:24:05 I was going to say that
01:24:07 the way I write
01:24:09 it never really seems to
01:24:11 to go that way
01:24:13 if I write something months ago
01:24:15 or if I start writing it like
01:24:17 loads and loads of months and then I finally
01:24:19 get to the part where it's finished and I can record it
01:24:21 as long as I've written like
01:24:23 like a little notes on how
01:24:25 I should inflect like
01:24:27 if I'm going for a specific
01:24:29 type of voice that I had
01:24:31 in my head at the time like
01:24:33 it's like John Tron from this particular video
01:24:35 this particular scene like I would write that
01:24:37 as a note next to the
01:24:39 part where I say that so that I know oh yeah
01:24:41 and then I can just I can
01:24:43 you know it's always
01:24:45 it never feels weird to come back to a script
01:24:47 for a long time because of that
01:24:49 for me it'll be like this whole
01:24:51 like the whole cadence of the script doesn't
01:24:53 make sense to me anymore sometimes like
01:24:55 the worst example was this video that I was
01:24:57 working on early last year
01:24:59 that was supposed to be
01:25:01 a movement in the Legend of Zelda
01:25:03 franchise where I was going to do like a whole
01:25:05 project where I played through every Zelda game
01:25:07 and like analyzed the way that the character
01:25:09 moves the way you do all your attacks and stuff
01:25:11 and I wrote part one which is like
01:25:13 20 minutes long and it covers the first
01:25:15 four games and
01:25:17 like even at the time it was
01:25:19 kind of a stilted and awkward script
01:25:21 like it was a little too stiff but
01:25:23 you know I had recorded it
01:25:25 I had uh
01:25:27 delivered it or whatever but then I
01:25:29 redid it again like like a year later I went
01:25:31 through and I rewrote parts of it because I wasn't satisfied
01:25:33 with the overall writing but then when I tried to
01:25:35 voice this new version it just
01:25:37 felt like this fucking Frankenstein monster
01:25:39 of a script and like I came off as this weird
01:25:41 like I was doing almost the Digibrony
01:25:43 voice of like way too
01:25:45 high pitched and like like a salesman kind
01:25:47 of thing because I don't really know what I'm reading
01:25:49 I feel like I'm reading somebody else's lines
01:25:51 that were written for me as opposed to a script
01:25:53 I wrote for myself and so
01:25:55 and you can see this too in the Shinbo
01:25:57 video and like you probably hold on for
01:25:59 no we got to go on the record
01:26:01 that the Shinbo video was where you learned to
01:26:03 defeat this at least for
01:26:05 temporarily you know you have a number of videos
01:26:07 that you wrote then you read them
01:26:09 like a year later and you sent them to me
01:26:11 and often we just redid the audio
01:26:13 for them we did another take to try and get more natural
01:26:15 and the voice you were often doing was like
01:26:17 you know Guts from Berserk
01:26:19 is an interesting anime
01:26:21 protagonist and it was like kind of awkward
01:26:23 but the Shinbo one is where you
01:26:25 created a new persona
01:26:27 to match this confused state
01:26:29 where like it's this weird like dub character voice
01:26:31 like ah you can Shinbo in the 90s
01:26:33 he has got this
01:26:35 not intentionally I assure you
01:26:37 it was unintentional but it was like
01:26:39 it felt more right and natural
01:26:41 I'm sure you can defend it
01:26:43 as not being a terrible read
01:26:45 but like nonetheless it has this
01:26:47 it has this issue whether it's like a problem
01:26:49 or not that there's a definitive
01:26:51 moment and you probably
01:26:53 wouldn't be able to find it unless I told
01:26:55 you like exactly where it was
01:26:57 like I don't think it's so blatant
01:26:59 but like after I talked about Hurricane Palomar
01:27:01 the stuff after that is what I'd written
01:27:03 later like and
01:27:05 there's like if you listen to the
01:27:07 early part of the script it's like I start off
01:27:09 every second real or every sentence
01:27:11 really high like Akiyuki Shinbo
01:27:13 and then he went to this studio
01:27:15 and I know exactly what you're talking
01:27:17 about Digi for some reason I always
01:27:19 end up going into a sentence really loud
01:27:21 the first time and I don't know why
01:27:23 and then like if you listen to later
01:27:25 in the video it suddenly feels way
01:27:27 more smooth and natural like the last
01:27:29 five or six minutes are like totally different
01:27:31 and that's because those have been written more recently
01:27:33 so yeah I really try now
01:27:35 to like if I write a script
01:27:37 let's try to get it voiced before too long
01:27:39 I mean it really takes a long time
01:27:41 for it to be that awkward like these are both
01:27:43 scripts that were a full year you know between
01:27:45 writing and and and reading
01:27:47 so I'm like a totally different writer
01:27:49 at that point but um
01:27:51 well you know aside from the whole
01:27:53 voiceover aspect of it I often get
01:27:55 because I'm working on projects for so long
01:27:57 and I know that you've gotten over this
01:27:59 Digi by just working faster
01:28:01 to like you get to a point
01:28:03 where everything that you're saying
01:28:05 in the video feels like of course
01:28:07 like obviously all these things are true
01:28:09 like why am I even making this
01:28:11 like I have not gotten past that
01:28:13 that's actually it's a big part
01:28:15 of why I like
01:28:17 handing things over to DeVoo
01:28:19 because usually it's the moment
01:28:21 when I've listened to it
01:28:23 back like when I've edited the audio
01:28:25 and then I listen to the audio back
01:28:27 that's the moment when that happens
01:28:29 that's the moment where it's like I've internalized it so much
01:28:31 that I no longer understand
01:28:33 if this is actually interesting or not
01:28:35 and like you know I'll be pacing around
01:28:37 my room listening there's there's a lot of scripts of mine
01:28:39 where I listen to it back and I'm just like
01:28:41 I don't even remember if this is good
01:28:43 and then I'll send it to DeVoo and he'll be like
01:28:45 this is the best thing I've ever heard and I'm like great
01:28:47 edit it because like
01:28:49 this project is really complicated
01:28:51 that involves me personally going over the script
01:28:53 several times like I always
01:28:55 almost always read the
01:28:57 post before I hear the audio
01:28:59 so that I can like get more of a sense of the
01:29:01 feeling of the pacing of the script
01:29:03 then I listen to it in some videos
01:29:05 are more complicated like aesthetic is
01:29:07 narrative that's one where I listen to it
01:29:09 a bajillion times over the course of making it
01:29:11 and I never had this moment of
01:29:13 maybe this isn't very good because
01:29:15 it's not my ego on the line
01:29:17 I'm able to distance myself
01:29:19 from the potential doubts
01:29:21 that was definitely one of the videos where like
01:29:23 every step of the way I was questioning it
01:29:25 like even you know
01:29:27 like up until people were commenting
01:29:29 that they thought it was great
01:29:31 I was still like I have no idea if this is
01:29:33 even comprehensible like the whole opening
01:29:35 segment is so esoteric that I was just like
01:29:37 I don't know if anyone's going to get this
01:29:39 if anyone's going to know where I'm coming from
01:29:41 the video was way more successful than it had
01:29:43 any right to be granted I put
01:29:45 the thumbnail but I remember
01:29:47 thinking like on the day I released
01:29:49 Girl Logging Part 2 like everyone is going
01:29:51 to fucking hate this it's going to be so
01:29:53 shit and no one's going to give a shit
01:29:55 and yet that was that was not the case
01:29:57 alright anyway let's let's move on
01:29:59 well what else you got to do
01:30:01 let's see um I could talk about
01:30:03 the specific editing
01:30:05 of doing a specific thing
01:30:07 putting a specific item
01:30:09 in a video how about that
01:30:11 you want to hear that yes
01:30:13 let's see we'll use the example
01:30:15 of like having an image that pans
01:30:17 into the screen during a couple of seconds
01:30:19 so like you know imagine I go
01:30:21 this game is almost as good as
01:30:23 peanut butter jelly sandwiches
01:30:25 and I'll get a picture
01:30:27 of a peanut butter jelly sandwich preferably one
01:30:29 with a uh an alpha background
01:30:31 meaning there's no background you know
01:30:33 if I can't find one I'll just open up
01:30:35 Gimp and you know isolate the color
01:30:37 white get rid of the white no background
01:30:39 so I put the image
01:30:41 into Premiere and
01:30:43 I then drop it from the library
01:30:45 of Premiere onto the timeline
01:30:47 now at the bottom of the timeline
01:30:49 there's going to be footage of the video game
01:30:51 and I'm going to put
01:30:53 peanut butter jelly sandwich image above
01:30:55 that so that way you see
01:30:57 a peanut butter jelly sandwich image
01:30:59 in front of you and the video game footage is behind
01:31:01 you but I don't want the peanut butter jelly
01:31:03 sandwich to just appear out of nowhere
01:31:05 you know sometimes that's good
01:31:07 sometimes you want the image to just snap it
01:31:09 in the middle of the screen all at once
01:31:11 sometimes you want a little bit more
01:31:13 of a smooth delivery
01:31:15 let me guess did you click
01:31:17 opacity well I could do that
01:31:19 but and for this example
01:31:21 I go to the X value
01:31:23 which for people who don't know
01:31:25 the X value is your horizontal position
01:31:27 we're going deep
01:31:29 I'll drag it left
01:31:31 words so that the peanut butter jelly sandwich
01:31:33 careens off of the screen
01:31:35 so it's no longer visible
01:31:37 now I then decide
01:31:39 a big mistake
01:31:41 you're going to go off the right side
01:31:43 with emotion like this I can tell you
01:31:45 emotionally with the peanut butter sandwich
01:31:47 it's always going to be from the right side
01:31:49 I will not question any specific details
01:31:51 that you would want to iron out
01:31:53 so take Nate's word on it for stuff like this
01:31:55 you know so
01:31:57 I try to decide
01:31:59 how long exactly
01:32:01 at what point of my audio delivery
01:32:03 do I want the peanut butter jelly sandwich
01:32:05 to be involved right like do I want it
01:32:07 to start scrolling in
01:32:09 during the this game
01:32:11 is almost as good as
01:32:13 or do I want it to start scrolling in at
01:32:15 peanut butter jelly sandwich
01:32:17 right so
01:32:19 I'll arrange the image
01:32:21 to be at exactly the point I want
01:32:23 and then I do have an actual
01:32:25 point about that is the timing
01:32:27 about like you've got to
01:32:29 take into consideration how
01:32:31 long it will take people
01:32:33 to process the image that's on screen
01:32:35 because when you're editing something
01:32:37 and you cut it to like
01:32:39 okay that's enough footage
01:32:41 and then you cut to the next thing
01:32:43 sometimes it's not enough time and you have to
01:32:45 make sure you watch it over like
01:32:47 oh yeah I can comprehend this and then
01:32:49 people will know what it is
01:32:51 before I move on
01:32:53 I was watching one
01:32:55 of my earlier videos
01:32:57 the mini clip one and there are certain parts
01:32:59 where I just cut way too quick
01:33:01 obviously because I didn't rewatch it properly
01:33:03 now there were like what I'm just curious
01:33:05 about what you think you did that with
01:33:07 do you
01:33:09 do you remember offhand anything that you thought was too
01:33:11 fast
01:33:13 I mean there's a lot of
01:33:15 parts in the mini clip video there's
01:33:17 alright fair enough
01:33:19 but it was just certain points where I was like
01:33:21 there's even one part where I
01:33:23 cut off the beginning
01:33:25 of the next sentence by like
01:33:27 half a syllable and it sounds a bit
01:33:29 weird oh so you mean like audio wise
01:33:31 well that's interesting audio and visual
01:33:33 I only ask because the current thing I'm editing
01:33:35 right now like basically a hundred percent
01:33:37 of it is exactly dealing with this
01:33:39 issue of like I'm trying to convey
01:33:41 these these ideas
01:33:43 with these visuals like as
01:33:45 as as efficiently as possible
01:33:47 while being able to like get the entire
01:33:49 like section
01:33:51 of information and like this sounds confusing
01:33:53 but like when you see the video in like two weeks
01:33:55 it'll make perfect sense but it's really
01:33:57 it's a struggle to manage like how long
01:33:59 and at what point you remove
01:34:01 an image or put it there so that they can digest
01:34:03 it and understand like what it means
01:34:05 that's like when I when I edit
01:34:07 with like images on screen that's like
01:34:09 what I spend by far the most time on is
01:34:11 like going back and watching it over
01:34:13 and over again and trying to figure out the timing because
01:34:15 the the other problem is you already
01:34:17 know the information and this is
01:34:19 the thing that's the thing with text
01:34:21 that's the hardest because you can read the text
01:34:23 faster when you already know what it says
01:34:25 so like I always
01:34:27 I always kind of like read it
01:34:29 like relatively slow like I like
01:34:31 read every word to myself
01:34:33 and then I I go like half a second
01:34:35 more than that you know to account for
01:34:37 like people who are slower readers than me and I'm
01:34:39 not the fastest so you know
01:34:41 I feel pretty confident about my text
01:34:43 speeds but I leave it for like just long enough
01:34:45 that I'm confident you can read it but even
01:34:47 then you know a lot of people aren't fucking
01:34:49 really paying attention at the
01:34:51 you know when when the text looks like they're not ready
01:34:53 for text to start appearing and then have to have to
01:34:55 have to read and engage in the video
01:34:57 there was one moment in my Rayman
01:34:59 video where I did the Paninkoic
01:35:01 style thing with the music and
01:35:03 and I had the
01:35:05 graph with Rayman and I had text on there
01:35:07 but it didn't really tell you anything you didn't already know
01:35:09 but I can tell like it's a bit too quick
01:35:11 for people to not want to pause
01:35:13 part of the joke
01:35:15 yeah that's the thing and you know it's interesting
01:35:17 I've been watching a lot of like
01:35:19 Mr. Donut the Donut
01:35:21 and he does a lot of like Jojo
01:35:23 and V's and I've been taking note
01:35:25 of his technique where he'll
01:35:27 he animates a lot of Jojo manga panels
01:35:29 and I'll have a panel come in and he'll do things like
01:35:31 just like have like
01:35:33 there'll be a sentence in it but what he'll do is on the
01:35:35 same side like on the opposite side of the screen from the panel
01:35:37 he'll like just have the words
01:35:39 like the crucial words like
01:35:41 he attacked and they'll be like
01:35:43 big and like ballooned out of the thing
01:35:45 despite like the sentence on the
01:35:47 right side had a sentence that included those words
01:35:49 but he's like emphasizing them
01:35:51 by showing them separately and it's an interesting technique
01:35:53 and I've been taking inspiration from it
01:35:55 so okay you know the thing I was saying
01:35:57 before about timeline positioning
01:35:59 there was actually a useful point
01:36:01 I was trying to make there
01:36:03 but then as I started making it I realized that
01:36:05 it's only something that people who have
01:36:07 edited lots of videos before or at least a couple
01:36:09 will understand so I started
01:36:11 like going into like exhaustive details
01:36:13 so that you could follow along otherwise
01:36:15 but I'm gonna give up on that alright
01:36:17 so forget about it
01:36:19 if you don't know video editing at all
01:36:21 you're not gonna understand this
01:36:23 so you know when I started making videos
01:36:25 and like wanting to have a peanut butter jelly sandwich
01:36:27 on the screen I would be like this constant
01:36:29 back and forth of like trying to adjust things
01:36:31 and move things around here and there to get the timing right
01:36:33 to get the positioning right all that kind of stuff
01:36:35 and it just felt like I was going back and forth
01:36:37 so there's a very simple layered
01:36:39 method of positioning things
01:36:41 and getting down those keyframes
01:36:43 so first I decide how long
01:36:45 it's going to be in the timeline right
01:36:47 I decide when it's going to come into existence
01:36:49 and when it's going to lead from existence
01:36:51 and then
01:36:53 I decide when the keyframes
01:36:55 will begin and end like
01:36:57 you know this game is almost as good as
01:36:59 I know that it's going to begin
01:37:01 moving at the
01:37:03 and then it's going to end at the
01:37:05 peanut butter jelly
01:37:07 that's gonna be where
01:37:09 it is done careening into the screen
01:37:11 so I make two keyframes
01:37:13 at the puh and the eh
01:37:15 and then I decide how it's going to leave
01:37:17 like sandwiches
01:37:19 that's when it's going to begin leaving
01:37:21 new keyframe then
01:37:23 like a half second after the
01:37:25 ends that's when it will be done
01:37:27 leaving the screen so I now have the
01:37:29 four keyframe positions and then
01:37:31 that is when I decide
01:37:33 where the thing is actually going to be positioned
01:37:35 into like where it's actually going to be
01:37:37 coming from and where it's going to be going
01:37:39 oh so you sort out the timing
01:37:41 before you sort out the position
01:37:43 I guess I will probably decide the default positioning
01:37:45 that way I don't have to adjust
01:37:47 every keyframe afterward you know
01:37:49 and this is not a strict
01:37:51 method but that's like hypothetically
01:37:53 that's a way to do it I'm getting
01:37:55 the truth not the facts here by the way
01:37:57 like that's how I'm
01:37:59 the best that's what I'm doing here
01:38:01 so uh yeah
01:38:03 all that aside I wanted to
01:38:05 like I want to ask about this because
01:38:07 when I watch Davoo edit
01:38:09 even though I'm pretty sure he's ultimately
01:38:11 doing something similar to what I do
01:38:13 which is to pull a bunch of clips from a show
01:38:15 and put them in a timeline
01:38:17 the actual way of going about it
01:38:19 is like radically different
01:38:21 and it's fascinating
01:38:23 because when I walk by and I see
01:38:25 to be editing this is what it sounds like
01:38:27 this is the sounds coming out of his computer
01:38:29 it's a constant like
01:38:31 and then I said to him
01:38:33 and then I said
01:38:35 like he has the audio
01:38:37 coming out at all times
01:38:39 and he's like scrolling back
01:38:41 through the timeline and you can hear the audio
01:38:43 being like fast forward and re-winded
01:38:45 interesting I just pause
01:38:47 and then I skip back and locate all the syllables
01:38:49 peanut butter
01:38:51 sandwiches you know
01:38:53 and then you also
01:38:55 you do the same thing when you're looking for clips
01:38:57 like you scroll through the footage
01:38:59 well I would like it
01:39:01 if it didn't happen then
01:39:03 what Digi's referring to is
01:39:05 maybe a 20 minute episode of THING
01:39:07 and then I'll show
01:39:09 some scene from 3 minutes in
01:39:11 and I still have the other 17 minutes
01:39:13 of the episode still sitting there
01:39:15 on the timeline I gotta deal with
01:39:17 so then maybe Digi's next sentence
01:39:19 addresses something that happens 11 minutes in
01:39:21 so I gotta go find the 11 minute mark
01:39:23 so I'll scroll through
01:39:25 and you know something like that
01:39:27 I wish it didn't make audio then
01:39:29 I wish there were a feature
01:39:31 where the
01:39:33 you can stop after like the first couple of like minutes or so
01:39:35 um yeah
01:39:37 wait DeVoo
01:39:39 you use a premiere
01:39:41 why don't you just
01:39:43 double click the footage
01:39:45 and have it be in the preview window
01:39:47 I do a variety of all of them
01:39:49 so I never get tired of one or the other
01:39:51 you know one thing I would love is if you could like
01:39:53 punch in like a timeline code
01:39:55 and you would skip to that position
01:39:57 of the timeline of that specific item
01:39:59 which I know you can but not very efficient
01:40:01 I use the preview
01:40:03 box or whatever it's called
01:40:05 because it has the whole thing in there
01:40:07 from start to finish and you just say
01:40:09 11 minutes in you can easily see where that is
01:40:11 I believe that's what I do most of the time
01:40:13 but I believe it even then will do the max
01:40:15 headroom audio even if you do it that way
01:40:17 so what's funny to me about it
01:40:19 is that like the way I select clips
01:40:21 is I'll throw the whole episode into
01:40:23 Vegas like somewhere way down the timeline
01:40:25 and then like
01:40:27 if you grab the edge
01:40:29 of a clip and drag it
01:40:31 then that you know cuts into it
01:40:33 and if you're looking at the preview window
01:40:35 you can see everything you're
01:40:37 cutting into it's like if you if you grab the edge
01:40:39 and let's say you move it 30 seconds
01:40:41 to the side you can watch those
01:40:43 30 seconds in the preview when gosh
01:40:45 that would be very useful so
01:40:47 so yeah so that's what I do is I just
01:40:49 I just grab the edge of the clip and then I just
01:40:51 keep scrolling until I find what I want
01:40:53 and then I you know
01:40:55 that works in Premiere as well
01:40:57 yeah you don't need to hear the audio
01:40:59 yeah and then I just I just take that that whole
01:41:01 I take the whole like let's say
01:41:03 we're not here to like correct Davoo's technique
01:41:05 I'm not describing my technique
01:41:07 you're gonna have to show me what you mean
01:41:09 I may very well do that already
01:41:11 yeah like I
01:41:13 you know let's say the clip I want
01:41:15 is two minutes into the episode so I throw the whole
01:41:17 episode into Vegas I grab the edge
01:41:19 of the clip and I just scroll until
01:41:21 I see that moment I want
01:41:23 then I drag the entire episode you know
01:41:25 into the timeline that I'm using
01:41:27 you know hit play until it reaches the part
01:41:29 I don't want hit cut and then I just move
01:41:31 that I move the entire rest of the episode back
01:41:33 out to the far edge of the timeline
01:41:35 and then I just keep doing that like I keep just
01:41:37 scrolling through and finding the things I want
01:41:39 but I absolute I
01:41:41 I cannot fucking stand
01:41:43 to hear like any audio
01:41:45 at all from anything happening in my timeline
01:41:47 I don't want to hear my voice I don't want to
01:41:49 hear the clips I don't want to hear anything
01:41:51 like you know I play music over all the editing
01:41:53 so I just I don't want to hear it
01:41:55 it drives me crazy it drives me crazy
01:41:57 edit if you don't know what you're hearing
01:41:59 I mean I can like I just have it
01:42:01 like you know I don't have music in my
01:42:03 videos so it's just my voice
01:42:05 so you know I just you can hear your voice
01:42:07 over the music I have the music turn
01:42:09 pretty low you know
01:42:11 and then I just but everything
01:42:13 is based around like I always edit based around
01:42:15 the exact length of a sentence so it's just
01:42:17 the clip starts when the sentence
01:42:19 starts the clip ends when the sentence ends
01:42:21 and that's how I do it so
01:42:23 which is pretty simple
01:42:25 and it just
01:42:27 it's all about minimizing how much like
01:42:29 I have to hear it and stuff
01:42:31 because I don't want to hear it
01:42:33 it drives me crazy
01:42:35 I just want to explain the way that I select clips
01:42:37 because it's very specific and it uses shortcuts
01:42:39 that might be helpful for people
01:42:41 I have my videos in the side
01:42:43 and you know for levels and stuff
01:42:45 I click on one when I know
01:42:47 that I need a clip from that level
01:42:49 and a lot of the time
01:42:51 if I'm talking about something specific I would
01:42:53 have written down in my scripts
01:42:55 the timecode for when that happens
01:42:57 in the video
01:42:59 so I would go to that I would find the thing
01:43:01 and I would press the I key which is the in button
01:43:03 and then move a bit and press the O key
01:43:05 which is the out button so that
01:43:07 is the section that is being
01:43:09 brought in when I drag it into the timeline
01:43:11 then what I do is
01:43:13 I unlink it from the audio
01:43:15 delete the audio because I never really need it
01:43:17 etc
01:43:19 couple times
01:43:21 where I might
01:43:23 so the audio is gone
01:43:25 and then what I do is
01:43:27 I will have a
01:43:29 way that all of the video game footage
01:43:31 in that review
01:43:33 has been cropped and resized
01:43:35 to fit the frame because
01:43:37 not always correct
01:43:39 there's a way that is really handy
01:43:41 if you just
01:43:43 have like a certain
01:43:45 thing set
01:43:47 you right click on the video footage
01:43:49 click copy and then right click
01:43:51 on the new video footage
01:43:53 and click paste
01:43:55 stuff I can't remember
01:43:57 exactly what it is but paste
01:43:59 a tribute
01:44:01 and you can basically paste the keyframes
01:44:03 for the motion for the size
01:44:05 for the opacity whatever it is
01:44:07 and all the effects and you can just copy
01:44:09 that into that new thing and you can do that
01:44:11 by dragging a box as well
01:44:13 so
01:44:15 anytime I put a new clip in
01:44:17 I just copy all the information
01:44:19 from the old clips
01:44:21 and I put them into the new ones
01:44:23 alright that's cool let's not get so bogged down
01:44:25 of the weeds though
01:44:27 it amuses me how
01:44:29 technical everybody else gets because
01:44:31 I've said this before
01:44:33 the reason I use Vegas is that I just think
01:44:35 it's incredibly simple
01:44:37 and what I mean by simple
01:44:39 is not that like
01:44:41 it's not all that advanced stuff
01:44:43 but you can also just like
01:44:45 manually do everything very easily
01:44:47 and so like for me it's
01:44:49 you know I could optimize everything
01:44:51 and I could make it easier on myself
01:44:53 but like it's easier for me to just parse it
01:44:55 if I just do everything
01:44:57 in order start to finish
01:44:59 I don't know why
01:45:01 obviously it takes more time
01:45:03 but I mean I edit fastest shit anyway
01:45:05 so it doesn't matter that much
01:45:07 I'm not sitting on a project
01:45:09 for days or anything
01:45:11 or even months as Nate would be
01:45:13 but yeah David was that
01:45:15 about wrapped up with your writing and editing process
01:45:17 please say yes
01:45:19 depends on what you want to say
01:45:21 I don't really need to add anything additional
01:45:23 okay Tom are you there yet
01:45:25 I'm back I'm here
01:45:27 yeah you want to talk about your writing and editing process
01:45:29 um yeah I mean
01:45:31 I hate editing
01:45:33 a lot
01:45:35 preach your brother
01:45:37 knows that like I've questioned multiple times
01:45:39 if I should even be making videos
01:45:41 because I hate it so much
01:45:43 like it drives me to suicide
01:45:45 it's the worst it's awful
01:45:47 I hate it
01:45:49 that being said I do a lot of it
01:45:51 so I mean my writing
01:45:53 you have some of the most pro looking videos
01:45:55 of any of us
01:45:57 your branding and stuff has always been
01:45:59 totally on point
01:46:01 I remember just like in your end cards
01:46:03 from the old you know brony curious videos
01:46:05 those were right away very professional
01:46:07 I remember modeling myself after them at one point
01:46:09 yeah I mean
01:46:11 I'm pretty good at the graphic stuff
01:46:13 just because I've been doing that forever
01:46:15 and like I don't it's funny because I don't mind doing
01:46:17 like uh
01:46:19 vfx stuff like the end cards
01:46:21 and the animation stuff like that I find really interesting
01:46:23 it's just the grind of like here's my
01:46:25 fucking dumbass voice and my dumbass face
01:46:27 and I'm gonna shoot all this fucking video
01:46:29 and find all these stupid clips I don't even care
01:46:31 but I've made my point I wrote it
01:46:33 just read the text if you weren't also fucking lazy
01:46:35 you goddamn millennials
01:46:37 and that's like my mindset the entire time I'm editing
01:46:39 it's like if youtube is never invented
01:46:41 I'd be fine
01:46:43 fuck everything so that's my mentality
01:46:45 when I'm editing so it's just hellish and I don't like it
01:46:47 um I don't think
01:46:49 I can probably I don't really
01:46:51 I can't get too much in the technical stuff because I use hitfilm
01:46:53 which I don't think anybody else uses
01:46:55 um
01:46:57 it's free it's free there's also
01:46:59 a paid version I don't have the paid version
01:47:01 well I do now because they just emailed me
01:47:03 they're like here's our $300 paid version
01:47:05 do a video on it and I'm like okay
01:47:07 so now I have the new version but what I like
01:47:09 about hitfilm is that it's free number one
01:47:11 if for the free express version
01:47:13 which is still really good it's like way better than iMovie
01:47:15 way better than windows movie maker
01:47:17 and what's cool about it it's like it's a adobe premiere
01:47:19 and adobe after effects in one
01:47:21 because you can do all the video editing
01:47:23 but you can also have like all the vfx stuff
01:47:25 if you want to do like animation and visual
01:47:27 like stuff like that
01:47:29 it's a lot of source or sloths than that too
01:47:31 it's the same program
01:47:33 because you can do everything which is pretty dope
01:47:35 but um
01:47:37 my writing process is pretty much like
01:47:39 very similar to yours Nate where you just get the idea
01:47:41 you have like the thesis concept
01:47:43 and you kind of just go and write it out
01:47:45 like I don't do a super fuck ton of research
01:47:47 because a lot of the writing that I did back
01:47:49 when I was doing reviews
01:47:51 and stuff was very much like personal
01:47:53 like my personal thing like that was the thing that I
01:47:55 always thought was really funny it's like people give me shit
01:47:57 like
01:47:59 like this isn't true or whatever
01:48:01 this isn't like true or what we want to hear
01:48:03 this is just my personal views on it
01:48:05 you know it's very much like a vlog style
01:48:07 like I'm just talking about
01:48:09 this is my interpretation if you don't like it
01:48:11 like that's fine
01:48:13 so I don't do too much research
01:48:15 on videos unless
01:48:17 like the point
01:48:19 I'm trying to make mandates like knowing the facts
01:48:21 I mean that's pretty crazy because you
01:48:23 you talk a lot of techno jargon
01:48:25 about all the fucking reviews you do
01:48:27 and I guess you just know that shit
01:48:29 well I mean
01:48:31 I don't do a lot of research on those either
01:48:33 just because I'm doing research for fun essentially
01:48:35 like I've read Engadget every day
01:48:37 for the last I think 10 years now
01:48:39 that's just part of my day
01:48:41 is going and reading blogs about all this shit
01:48:43 like that's just I wake up
01:48:45 and like 10 minutes in like that's what I do
01:48:47 I'm just like oh I wonder what happened when I was asleep
01:48:49 that'll do it
01:48:51 so I know a lot of stuff about that
01:48:53 but those
01:48:55 it's two different processes
01:48:57 like we're doing like a review versus doing a product review
01:48:59 because there's like a lot more
01:49:01 camera work and stuff involved with the product
01:49:03 because it's a physical object that you have to get
01:49:05 footage of and that's obviously different
01:49:07 than you know
01:49:09 tracking down a cartoon and getting the
01:49:11 clips you need out of that
01:49:13 so it's required a lot more like knowledge and learning about
01:49:15 photography and cinematography
01:49:17 and things like that
01:49:19 the beginning videos I did were really bad
01:49:21 I didn't have any of that shit
01:49:23 so it was all like handheld done with like
01:49:25 a point and shoot camera which did not look very good
01:49:27 yeah of course
01:49:29 but now it's slowly starting to get better
01:49:31 than
01:49:33 the thing I was going to talk about with the camera
01:49:35 because if you're using the same camera I am the T2i
01:49:37 what I ended up doing because like
01:49:39 it doesn't have a flip screen which sucks
01:49:41 my old camera did have a flip screen
01:49:43 but it was a point and shoot camera and I had to sell it
01:49:45 because I needed money because I had to pay my bills
01:49:47 so I had to let that camera go which sucks
01:49:49 so now I'm using a T2i
01:49:51 which is still a good camera but it doesn't have
01:49:53 the flip screen it's like older
01:49:55 it doesn't have a lot of modern features
01:49:57 the no flip only now am I realizing
01:49:59 what a fucking waste of money it was
01:50:01 to get something without a flip screen
01:50:03 you can't do it unless you have a guy with you
01:50:05 but okay well this is
01:50:07 my like ghetto tech solution
01:50:09 which is not really ghetto tech at all but it's a good way
01:50:11 the nice thing about those big DSLRs
01:50:13 they have a ton of fucking ports
01:50:15 and one of the ports on the side is mini
01:50:17 hdmi so if you get
01:50:19 a mini hdmi adapter on ebay
01:50:21 for like a dollar take
01:50:23 your hdmi cable from your monitor
01:50:25 take it out of your computer put it in the adapter
01:50:27 plug the adapter into the camera then turn it on
01:50:29 and the screen is on your
01:50:31 computer monitor oh my god that's perfect
01:50:33 I never fucking knew
01:50:35 that is fucking
01:50:37 amazing it's great and then
01:50:39 what you need to do with the Canon firmware is there's
01:50:41 an aftermarket firmware you can download called magic lantern
01:50:43 and I put that on my T2i
01:50:45 you put it on the SD card
01:50:47 and then you go into the Canon settings
01:50:49 you hit update firmware and it will overwrite
01:50:51 the stock firmware with the magic lantern
01:50:53 firmware it adds a bunch
01:50:55 of new cinematography features you can monitor
01:50:57 your curves right on the screen you can monitor
01:50:59 your white balance it adds what's called
01:51:01 that's great because I swear to god the managing
01:51:03 of like the white balance of the shadow of this computer
01:51:05 is I mean this camera is fucking impossible
01:51:07 I can't navigate these
01:51:09 the best thing that's gonna save your fucking life they have an option for
01:51:11 focus peaking do you know what focus peaking is
01:51:13 yeah so you
01:51:15 put focus peaking on there and it'll
01:51:17 have like red dots around whatever's
01:51:19 in focus so when you go to stand
01:51:21 back away if your face has like red dots
01:51:23 on it you know you're in focus
01:51:25 I didn't even think this kind of shit was possible
01:51:27 you've blown my mind to shit Tom
01:51:29 like I'm about to go dig up
01:51:31 Victor's old fucking T4i
01:51:33 that he won't use anymore because he's got a real
01:51:35 camera now and I'm just gonna fucking steal it
01:51:37 dude I would like sell
01:51:39 my left nut for a T2i those things with magic lantern
01:51:41 are great so
01:51:43 my baby little T2i
01:51:45 is like very jealous but yeah
01:51:47 magic lantern like will save your fucking life
01:51:49 and that's kind of like the last like
01:51:51 seven videos I've shot were on the T2i
01:51:53 and I'm slowly kind of trying to figure out
01:51:55 how to make this dinosaur work for me
01:51:57 you're fucking video quality
01:51:59 like definitely jumped up in the last
01:52:01 view like in terms of framing
01:52:03 and being in focus and
01:52:05 the lighting not being shit
01:52:07 or the white balance not being shit like it's gotten
01:52:09 a lot better
01:52:11 on the one hand I'm doing a lot of the camera stuff
01:52:13 on the other hand I'm looking into like post-production
01:52:15 so like I'm not doing like color
01:52:17 balance and white balance and
01:52:19 crushing blacks and whites and getting like the contrast
01:52:21 looking good I'm trying to make it look very filmic
01:52:23 like everyone's like oh man 60fps I'm just like
01:52:25 I'm gonna do 24fps so it looks like a movie
01:52:27 because that's the look I like
01:52:29 so I'm like I'm going down when everyone else is going up
01:52:31 so it's a lot of just like
01:52:33 tweaking with things like that which
01:52:35 all of that I find fascinating
01:52:37 is the actual editing part that I want to like
01:52:39 make someone else do because it's
01:52:41 sucks and it makes
01:52:43 something I want to know about
01:52:45 is you still do this right
01:52:47 you use a teleprompter
01:52:49 for all your stuff
01:52:51 like a makeshift one
01:52:53 yeah so there is a video on YouTube
01:52:55 by Film Riot they're a great channel
01:52:57 for like DIY filmmaking and stuff and they had
01:52:59 I'm completely cut out
01:53:01 am I alive?
01:53:03 yeah so there's a channel
01:53:05 called Film Riot which is great for
01:53:07 DIY filmmaking and stuff and they have a tutorial
01:53:09 on how to build a teleprompter
01:53:11 so
01:53:13 just like to build
01:53:15 so what you do you take like a 2x4
01:53:17 or like a piece of plywood
01:53:19 and then you screw in like hinges on
01:53:21 a picture frame and then prop that up
01:53:23 at 90 degrees and
01:53:25 you put your camera in there
01:53:27 and you get like
01:53:29 a screen or something you drop onto the plywood
01:53:31 and reflect onto the picture frames glass
01:53:33 and then you can read it
01:53:35 so what I did is I took my old
01:53:37 iPad that someone from Twitter
01:53:39 I actually went on Twitter like a couple years ago
01:53:41 and was like I need an iPad
01:53:43 I will pay somebody and this guy was just like
01:53:45 I'll just give you this old iPad that I don't use anymore
01:53:47 it's sitting in a box it's like super old and it's like cracked
01:53:49 but it doesn't matter I'm like dude I don't care
01:53:51 I just need that so I got this old iPad
01:53:53 and I used that and there's an application for the iPad
01:53:55 called Prompt Smart
01:53:57 and it saved my life because I was using
01:53:59 other online
01:54:01 teleprompter software but it auto scrolls
01:54:03 so you have to like keep up with the
01:54:05 prompt so if you fuck up
01:54:07 like it's gone
01:54:09 and so you're just like well I got to figure that out
01:54:11 Prompt Smart is great
01:54:13 is because it uses the iPad's mic
01:54:15 to track your voice so it only
01:54:17 scrolls as you're talking so you can
01:54:19 stop talking for like 15 minutes
01:54:21 when someone comes downstairs and like
01:54:23 bitches you out or something and then you can just
01:54:25 go back and start right where you left off
01:54:27 and it'll just start scrolling again
01:54:29 so whenever I do like reviews
01:54:31 and stuff where I need to sound like an intelligent
01:54:33 human being like I'll usually script it out
01:54:35 and throw it on there and you just throw
01:54:37 the camera behind it and you throw a piece of glass
01:54:39 or a piece of cloth over it so it blocks out the light
01:54:41 from the backside so
01:54:43 the camera lens doesn't
01:54:45 see the reflection that's on the glass
01:54:47 it just looks like you're looking into the camera lens
01:54:49 because the screen is right in front of it so you're
01:54:51 reading but it looks like you're making eye contact
01:54:53 so that's super handy and the only reason
01:54:55 I like it like
01:54:57 I watch your videos and like I can
01:54:59 just barely see the subtle movement of
01:55:01 your eyes and only because I know
01:55:03 that it's teleprompter do I
01:55:05 like you know detect it I don't think most people
01:55:07 would ever realize
01:55:09 it's getting more noticeable now because
01:55:11 I just got the t2i and it doesn't have the right lens
01:55:13 to do video it has a 50 prime
01:55:15 lens which is great for photos if you're going out
01:55:17 on the street and doing photography because it has
01:55:19 already a good amount of zoom built in
01:55:21 but when I'm shooting now with this
01:55:23 t2i it's like 4 or 5 feet away
01:55:25 from me even though it looks like it's right in my face
01:55:27 because the prime lens has so much zoom
01:55:29 so I need to get like
01:55:31 a $70 pancake lens or something
01:55:33 that'll be work better for that but like I'm super
01:55:35 getting into photography and like cinematography
01:55:37 and color grading now because I have to like
01:55:39 force myself to learn it so I'm like oh this is cool
01:55:41 you can do this and you can change the colors
01:55:43 of like the shadows and the highlights independently
01:55:45 to get a more film look and I'm just like
01:55:47 you know what I do I get a footage
01:55:49 that's hopefully reasonably in focus
01:55:51 and then I just throw that shit into Vegas
01:55:53 and then I open color corrector and I just
01:55:55 fuck with the knobs until things look
01:55:57 reasonably okay and it works
01:55:59 amazing it's awesome
01:56:01 I mean it does but I can always tell that you've
01:56:03 color corrected your videos you know like it doesn't
01:56:05 look natural you can't tell shit
01:56:07 you don't know nobody fucking knows
01:56:09 I can always tell that you've color corrected your videos
01:56:11 that's kind of what's nice about Hillfilm
01:56:13 is that you're feeling lazy they have like under the
01:56:15 presets it's like auto color auto contrast
01:56:17 auto lighting it's like do-do-do and then it fixes
01:56:19 like 90% of the things
01:56:21 great for saving cell phone footage
01:56:23 like every time I shoot with my iPhone
01:56:25 cause I'll do that sometimes
01:56:27 it always comes out like Duke
01:56:29 and then I'll just like throw that on there and it'll
01:56:31 magically look like it was shot with like a $100
01:56:33 better camera just from doing the color correction
01:56:35 that's like
01:56:37 I'm fascinated Tom that like cause I feel like
01:56:39 the rest of us we encounter a problem
01:56:41 and then we're just like trying to solve it
01:56:43 through like
01:56:45 you know it coming up with something
01:56:47 and you actually just like find a technology
01:56:49 that can do that
01:56:51 you know you're like surely something out there
01:56:53 is built to fix this problem that I can somehow
01:56:55 get for free and you'll find that thing
01:56:57 and the rest of us are sitting here like
01:56:59 trying to fucking like reinvent the wheel
01:57:01 or something just to have a
01:57:03 image score across the screen
01:57:05 I don't know I just I just don't want to spend any money
01:57:07 I'll spend a little bit of money
01:57:09 just say that you're an internet reviewer
01:57:11 and please send me your product so I can do a
01:57:13 Tom is amazing at finding
01:57:15 like he said he uses fucking HitFilm
01:57:17 to edit like it's a free program that
01:57:19 you know that's as powerful as
01:57:21 like a real fucking
01:57:23 big boys program you know
01:57:25 that we're all stealing and barely
01:57:27 know how to use
01:57:29 it's it's pretty good
01:57:31 and they're probably they usually come out with a new version
01:57:33 every
01:57:35 Wizard of Vegas bitch
01:57:37 in the next few months which will probably be even better
01:57:39 but it's really good
01:57:41 works great
01:57:43 I like it
01:57:45 I don't know
01:57:47 when my editing process itself
01:57:49 though is usually just like lots of cursing
01:57:51 lots of swearing
01:57:53 lots of racial slurs that I regret later
01:57:55 because I really couldn't be saying those things
01:57:57 and just getting the supremely fucking
01:57:59 pissed off at shit not working
01:58:01 Tom I heard a tweet recently
01:58:03 that you discovered my
01:58:05 ancient method
01:58:07 for dealing with editing
01:58:09 which is the good old fashioned
01:58:11 alcohol method
01:58:13 yeah I mean at this point
01:58:15 I'm just like getting
01:58:17 lots of rum and I'll get
01:58:19 and I'll just have that by me while I'm
01:58:21 editing and every time something happens
01:58:23 I'll just take another drink
01:58:25 the reason I started doing it is because
01:58:27 I don't know if anybody else has this problem
01:58:29 but the reason I hate editing so much
01:58:31 is because editing hates me
01:58:33 I've been doing YouTube for almost five years now
01:58:35 and every single video has fucked up
01:58:37 somehow I've never had a video where it's just like
01:58:39 I started and ended and nothing
01:58:41 happened footage will always get corrupted
01:58:43 if the camera will always fuck up
01:58:45 the audio will always die on me
01:58:47 every week something happens
01:58:49 and I just want to blow my brain down
01:58:51 I mean it's like you've been forced to adapt
01:58:53 to learn all these advanced technological solutions
01:58:55 because it's trying to fuck with you
01:58:57 well just last week I recorded that video
01:58:59 on the Artistle D10
01:59:01 and I had to shoot it three times
01:59:03 because the first time the camera died
01:59:05 and I found out the camera died because my SD card was too
01:59:07 low tech to use with this new camera
01:59:09 my $30 SD card
01:59:11 the second time I did it
01:59:13 the framing wasn't right
01:59:15 and then the other time I did it
01:59:17 I've had everything right and I was like
01:59:19 oh man this video actually went
01:59:21 like this recording was great
01:59:23 no problems I didn't even stutter as much as I usually did
01:59:25 I put it into my computer
01:59:27 or sorry your memory card has been corrupted
01:59:29 so all the files were lost
01:59:31 so I had to record the video of me talking again
01:59:33 and all the B-roll I had shot
01:59:35 the three previous hours
01:59:37 it was like a two hour project
01:59:39 because everything fucking hates me
01:59:41 and it's just like oh my god
01:59:43 I really think god is up there
01:59:45 you should just be blogging
01:59:47 I'm going to make your life hell until you quit video
01:59:49 and just blog like a normal person
01:59:51 I've definitely experienced some of that shit
01:59:53 but it sounds brutal
01:59:55 I've experienced a lot of it
01:59:57 but it doesn't happen as much lately
01:59:59 and this is going to make everybody mad to say
02:00:01 but I just bought
02:00:03 better equipment
02:00:05 the way I fought my way around it is like
02:00:07 I don't want to have these problems
02:00:09 I'm just going to buy all the best shit
02:00:11 and the best shit doesn't fail as much
02:00:13 like when you've got a computer
02:00:15 that can just crunch through
02:00:17 you know I mean I can be
02:00:19 too past rendering something
02:00:21 and recording a podcast and listening to
02:00:23 well I wouldn't be listening to this
02:00:25 I remember watching your video
02:00:27 yesterday or today
02:00:29 about the whatever
02:00:31 the new guru thing or whatever
02:00:33 on the screen you were rendering a video
02:00:35 while you were recording this and I was like
02:00:37 what is this nigga doing right now
02:00:39 I was recording
02:00:41 the screen capturing
02:00:43 in 1080p with open broadcaster
02:00:45 and I was rendering a let's play
02:00:47 at the same time a two pass render
02:00:49 at 720p I think
02:00:51 so
02:00:53 I didn't have audacity open
02:00:55 at the time because I was recording through the program
02:00:57 I fucking closed Vegas before starting this call
02:00:59 because I was afraid it was going to fuck my shit up
02:01:01 consider this
02:01:03 after that after I had finished
02:01:05 that recording I edited
02:01:07 that video and I rendered it
02:01:09 at the same time as the other render was going
02:01:11 well that's just stupid I just rendered two videos at once
02:01:13 it worked perfectly fine
02:01:15 comment on the alcohol method by the way
02:01:17 I want to say the alcohol I do that too
02:01:19 sometimes like if I had enough alcohol
02:01:21 around me I would do it probably a lot
02:01:23 because if it's a video
02:01:25 where it's basic stuff that I
02:01:27 know how to do sufficiently really well
02:01:29 without having to double think it
02:01:31 there's that level of drunkenness
02:01:33 of mildly moderate drunkenness
02:01:35 where you can do things you're really used to
02:01:37 you don't want to get actual drunk
02:01:39 because then you just have a headache
02:01:41 but if you just buzz
02:01:43 that makes
02:01:45 that dulls the pain of like
02:01:47 repetitiveness
02:01:49 it's quite useful
02:01:51 not to cut you off too soon
02:01:53 but perhaps we should just move on to Digi
02:01:55 so we can wrap this thing up
02:01:57 Digi, holy damn
02:01:59 I always see
02:02:01 you might have noticed that every time we do one of these podcasts
02:02:03 where we round Robin I always make myself go last
02:02:05 so that because I know
02:02:07 I'm gonna piggyback on what everyone else says
02:02:09 throughout the podcast and that'll get out half
02:02:11 of what I wanted to say so that it's not
02:02:13 like an unbroken hour of me talking
02:02:15 but yeah
02:02:17 so okay
02:02:19 writing process
02:02:21 because for me writing and editing
02:02:23 process are like two totally different worlds now
02:02:25 because the videos I actually write are edited by somebody else
02:02:28 and the videos I edit are usually not written
02:02:30 so it's like
02:02:32 I've got two whole different schools going on
02:02:34 you know and
02:02:36 the writing process is totally different
02:02:39 depending on what kind of video it is
02:02:41 if it's one that's like
02:02:43 let's say
02:02:45 ten cool directing tricks in Evangelion
02:02:48 you know that involves like having to watch
02:02:50 Evangelion and like take notes
02:02:52 and find episodes where
02:02:54 those things happen and stuff like that
02:02:56 or
02:02:58 I just did one on the scene from Shirobako
02:03:00 I had to go rewatch that scene
02:03:02 make sure I had all my facts straight and even then
02:03:04 I'm helped by having
02:03:06 an unbelievably good memory
02:03:08 I can usually remember most of what happens
02:03:10 in shows that I've seen
02:03:12 usually I can remember down to what episode it was
02:03:14 sometimes even where in the episode it happened
02:03:16 so
02:03:18 I don't struggle too much with having to take notes on things
02:03:20 and I only really
02:03:22 have to go and recheck
02:03:24 and rewatch stuff if it's a show I hate
02:03:26 those are the ones where I probably
02:03:28 wasn't paying the most attention
02:03:30 like the asterisk war
02:03:32 I've seen all of it like three times
02:03:34 in total
02:03:36 because I had to watch the whole thing
02:03:38 take notes then watch it
02:03:40 and then pause
02:03:42 every minute
02:03:44 when I dissect the first episode
02:03:46 it's like I'll watch 30 seconds of it
02:03:48 and then hit pause and then write a page
02:03:50 about those 30 seconds I just watched
02:03:52 probably have to rewatch them a couple more times
02:03:54 while writing it
02:03:56 when I do
02:03:58 watch stuff for a video
02:04:00 it's never like I watched it
02:04:02 and took notes and then wrote
02:04:04 it's usually I just keep going back
02:04:06 to the show like I have it open in another tab
02:04:08 and I'm like you know
02:04:10 write a paragraph then watch
02:04:12 the clip back and make sure
02:04:14 the Shirobako one
02:04:16 you list yourself as having rewatched
02:04:18 the asterisk war on Mal for that reason
02:04:20 I've rewatched it three times according to Mal
02:04:22 okay well I'm going to go and mark myself as having
02:04:24 rewatched it six times
02:04:26 that's probably it
02:04:28 so yeah
02:04:30 I'll go through
02:04:32 for stuff like that but then a lot of it is just from
02:04:34 memory and it really depends on how much
02:04:36 I can get away with like cool character designs
02:04:38 Gurren Lagann I've seen Gurren Lagann three times
02:04:40 in the past the last time I watched it was
02:04:42 early
02:04:44 last year so almost two years ago
02:04:46 didn't matter I was able to write it without rewatching
02:04:48 the show I was afraid I would have to
02:04:50 rewatch the show but I was like I fucking know
02:04:52 the character designs in Gurren Lagann you know
02:04:54 it's not going to be a problem but I have
02:04:56 this excellent failsafe
02:04:58 which is the Deveu because
02:05:00 usually when I write a video
02:05:02 you know he's going to have to watch the whole
02:05:04 show in order to edit it because he has to know
02:05:06 everything that's going to go in he has to find all the clips
02:05:08 so
02:05:10 I'll send stuff to him and like if there's
02:05:12 something I say that outright is wrong
02:05:14 he'll usually tell me like hey I wasn't able
02:05:16 to find a scene like that you know
02:05:18 and I'll be like well I guess I have to
02:05:20 rewrite it or I'll tell him well this
02:05:22 scene's kind of like it so use that one
02:05:24 you know like this is close enough
02:05:26 this will make it look like I'm correct
02:05:28 so yeah
02:05:30 I kind of like I use the fact
02:05:32 that Deveu is going to watch the show like
02:05:34 with Gurren Lagann you know I had him
02:05:36 go back through and there is there was
02:05:38 one thing that like in that
02:05:40 video in particular
02:05:42 Deveu was editing it down to the
02:05:44 fucking wire on the deadline with it like it was
02:05:46 due by midnight
02:05:48 and it was uploaded
02:05:50 like at 11.30 you know because we had to
02:05:52 get it out by the end of the month and I
02:05:54 would have probably had him
02:05:56 cut out the part where I say that the beast men
02:05:58 all have sketchy outlines
02:06:00 yeah was not proven
02:06:02 visually like the stuff you
02:06:04 show didn't prove that at all and I would have
02:06:06 totally no believe me I looked
02:06:08 extremely thoroughly and I could not
02:06:10 really find it. Well that's the kind of thing where
02:06:12 if I had rewatched the show I would have just
02:06:14 cut that line out because it's obviously not true
02:06:16 I don't know I feel like the fact that
02:06:18 the art direction did something
02:06:20 to give you that impression
02:06:22 means that there's something going on with
02:06:24 the art there. Well there is such a thing as fucking up so
02:06:26 you know. I mean I think I just should have
02:06:28 the sentence is
02:06:30 factually inaccurate they do not have
02:06:32 sketchy outlines consistently across the
02:06:34 characters and like
02:06:36 you know Davoo showed footage which clearly
02:06:38 proved me wrong so I was like
02:06:40 okay this should have been cut but at that
02:06:42 stage it was too late. I picked the clips
02:06:44 that prove you the least wrong possible
02:06:46 yeah that's fair. Which is sad because I watched them
02:06:48 and I went oh well I guess I was wrong.
02:06:50 You know what I believe I was going to tell you about that
02:06:52 like when I was at that part but you were like a sleep
02:06:54 yeah well that's the problem. A sleep at the
02:06:56 wheel more like making these fucking videos. Editing down to the fucking
02:06:58 literal last minute because I noticed it and I
02:07:00 was just like we can't do anything about it it's too late
02:07:02 this video has to come out by the end of the month
02:07:04 you know. And thus that corporate
02:07:06 shill influence starts to take the
02:07:08 art here we go down the fucking
02:07:10 rabbit hole. More importantly has anyone
02:07:12 complained about that. Right now
02:07:14 fuck you guys.
02:07:16 You know I was like
02:07:18 when me and Ben were watching it back I was like
02:07:20 oh that's clearly like a point I didn't
02:07:22 make and Ben's like yeah you
02:07:24 you know that not proven. Yeah but
02:07:26 then you'd have to cut out the part where you say
02:07:28 that Lord Genome has the most
02:07:30 crazy out. Now and I mean
02:07:32 the other problem would be that by cutting
02:07:34 out time the video because the video is exactly
02:07:36 ten minutes and one second long
02:07:38 and it's over ten minutes that means you get
02:07:40 the double on the advertising at the end of
02:07:42 the video so you know like how
02:07:44 what am I going to cut out twenty seconds
02:07:46 worth of the video because I was kind of wrong
02:07:48 and then like lose half the ad revenue
02:07:50 I could have on it in retention you know. You fucking
02:07:52 shill bitch. You
02:07:54 don't fucking lie and say
02:07:56 things are intentionally wrong. I feel like
02:07:58 in this case it was a mistake. Maybe you could
02:08:00 just alter the line. Throw money at it.
02:08:02 No you can get the better equipment
02:08:04 but you deserve to be shit on it. Throw the
02:08:06 shackles at everybody and you win.
02:08:08 Well think of it. That's what I've learned today.
02:08:10 Think of it this way I mean if the
02:08:12 on-screen footage is actively proving
02:08:14 me wrong then everyone can observe
02:08:16 that I was wrong. You know I don't
02:08:18 have to make a correction. What is that excuse
02:08:20 like oh I don't need to be right because they'll just prove
02:08:22 me wrong later it's totally not on me guys it's everyone
02:08:24 else's fault. No no no I'm saying
02:08:26 everyone you could have. Everyone can look at the
02:08:28 screen and go well he clearly was wrong about
02:08:30 that. His editor found that out you
02:08:32 know. So
02:08:34 I don't know. I feel like most
02:08:36 people would probably be like
02:08:38 I guess those lines are sketchy. Maybe
02:08:40 they just didn't show the sketchy part. Yeah
02:08:42 I think most people would doubt
02:08:44 themselves. You know you could have the line
02:08:46 could have just been altered to the beast
02:08:48 men are drawn in a subtly
02:08:50 different manner. Yeah no
02:08:52 it could have been fixed but we didn't have
02:08:54 time because the fucking true
02:08:56 I mean Viral looks the same I mean you know
02:08:58 he's weird but yeah
02:09:00 whatever I don't care. Point being
02:09:02 it was it was a mistake and
02:09:04 but anyways
02:09:06 the writing process you know for something like
02:09:08 Shinbo in the 90s is like we
02:09:10 like me and DeVoo would watch through the OVA
02:09:12 I'd note down all the things that happened
02:09:14 in that OVA and then I'd
02:09:16 write three paragraphs about that OVA
02:09:18 you know and contain all the information so
02:09:20 some of it's written like that then some of it
02:09:22 is just like me just pulling from
02:09:24 my wealth of anime knowledge and
02:09:26 the way that my writing usually works
02:09:28 is that it starts
02:09:30 with the first sentence like I
02:09:32 I have an idea I'm thinking
02:09:34 alright
02:09:36 anime there's too much anime about
02:09:38 high school and my theory is that
02:09:40 it's because high school is secretly the most
02:09:42 interesting part of a Japanese person's life
02:09:44 how do I start this post
02:09:46 and I'll go outside and I'll be walking around
02:09:48 and I'll just think like it's
02:09:50 usually just a catchy sentence like something fun
02:09:52 like god whatever
02:09:54 I say at the start anime and high school
02:09:56 are practically inseparable
02:09:58 you know like that's how I'd present this idea
02:10:00 and then from there it just
02:10:02 it just goes like as soon as I figure out
02:10:04 that first sentence the rest of the thing is
02:10:06 pretty much locked in place and I just sit
02:10:08 down and fucking go
02:10:10 and it's rare I don't know how many of you guys
02:10:12 like know Digi's writing history
02:10:14 but for those who don't like he just
02:10:16 has always I guess he said he always just
02:10:18 writes in a stream of consciousness
02:10:20 most of the time and he just did it so much
02:10:22 for so long and I'm just so that he would
02:10:24 actually be really good and I mean yeah you can go
02:10:26 through my whole writing history on my
02:10:28 blog and see everything I've written and in the early days
02:10:30 it's a lot of it's barely
02:10:32 comprehensible and there's so many
02:10:34 extraneous details like
02:10:36 the way I used to write is just
02:10:38 I mean it's always been just whatever comes into
02:10:40 my head but as a result of that
02:10:42 like I used to just not cut anything
02:10:44 and it was just like I
02:10:46 hadn't I wouldn't think about it enough
02:10:48 for writing it you know like
02:10:50 I don't take notes but I think on the thing
02:10:52 like if I have an idea for a video I walk
02:10:54 around I consider it I think
02:10:56 what's the angle I'm going to approach it from
02:10:58 and then I write it all at once back then
02:11:00 it would just be like there's all these personal
02:11:02 anecdotes in there that don't belong or just like
02:11:04 notations on like how
02:11:06 hot this character is totally
02:11:08 out of nowhere and not in the funny
02:11:10 way I do it now where it's like you know and
02:11:12 by the way dairy's got the best body in the
02:11:14 series just saying you know like it's kind of a little
02:11:16 tricky thing but but also something I did
02:11:18 want to be in the video
02:11:20 like how can idiots
02:11:22 like you say that when Nia there
02:11:24 and I'm talking about little baby Nia little baby
02:11:26 Nia's got the best body in the series that's a
02:11:28 close second I mean I'm like not even
02:11:30 joking that like child Nia 14 year old
02:11:32 Nia is one of the most attractive characters
02:11:34 ever in an anime I agree
02:11:36 I don't think she's less attractive
02:11:38 than dairy I just think dairy has the
02:11:40 best bod like
02:11:42 damn maybe she's got that fucking ass well she's
02:11:44 one who was in the tight fitting outfits
02:11:46 you can't really compare
02:11:48 Nia's got kind of a banana body
02:11:50 you know she's she ain't got
02:11:52 no ass dairy's got that
02:11:54 she really she's
02:11:56 not much better dairy it's
02:11:58 whatever I'll study it later
02:12:00 please do
02:12:02 but anyways
02:12:04 yeah like my old
02:12:06 writing was just a total chaotic mess
02:12:08 and I've talked about this before how like what
02:12:10 I what I
02:12:12 had this revelation where I had this teacher in college
02:12:14 who told me like
02:12:16 I had to write something for him and he wanted it to be like 500
02:12:18 words and of course I way overshot
02:12:20 went for like 700 because back in high
02:12:22 school that impresses a teacher
02:12:24 if you go over the word count
02:12:26 yeah for sure and college this was not impressive
02:12:28 he was like this is too long I asked for 500
02:12:30 words and he's like you know cut
02:12:32 out all these extraneous details and stuff so I start
02:12:34 removing shit and I give it to him again it's like
02:12:36 550 words and he's like look you really
02:12:38 he was like I think you you have like a great
02:12:40 written voice but you need to learn how to simplify
02:12:42 he said he's specifically said simplify
02:12:44 simplify simplify and I was like
02:12:46 okay now I gotta get serious
02:12:48 so I start like running through this thing with a fine
02:12:50 tooth comb and like making every sentence
02:12:52 perfect and like it was so satisfying
02:12:54 to do that that I then
02:12:56 totally changed my anime
02:12:58 blogging style and like started
02:13:00 just like obsessing over
02:13:02 every script and like perfecting all the sentences
02:13:04 until that came naturally
02:13:06 and then I switched back to this more conversational
02:13:08 freeform style but now I
02:13:10 can just condense information well I
02:13:12 just know how to do that
02:13:14 so yeah it was just like this learning process
02:13:16 of if you yeah again if you go back
02:13:18 through read like my stuff from 2010
02:13:20 and read the stuff
02:13:22 in the summer of 2010 because you'll see this
02:13:24 moment where
02:13:26 I think the last post I'd written in my sprawling
02:13:28 style was
02:13:30 being an anime
02:13:32 lifer or like being a Yu-Gi-Oh
02:13:34 life or something like that where it was it was
02:13:36 me observing how different people have
02:13:38 called themselves like there's certain shows
02:13:40 that they're just obsessed with for their whole lives
02:13:42 and I never really had something like that and I was like
02:13:44 I guess Yu-Gi-Oh is a show
02:13:46 I've always been into but like I'm not like
02:13:48 way into it or anything that's the point of the post
02:13:50 it's like 1300 words
02:13:52 and half of it is totally extraneous
02:13:54 it could have been cut and so after
02:13:56 like I you know got this simplification
02:13:58 simplification lesson
02:14:00 I looked at that post and I was like god this is awful
02:14:02 like why did I write all this extra stuff in here
02:14:04 this is not what I should be doing and so the very
02:14:06 next like three posts are like spartan
02:14:08 it's like 500 word tight little
02:14:10 posts and then it like expands back out
02:14:12 from there so you know that's sort of the
02:14:14 development of my style and now it's
02:14:16 just the ideas in my head
02:14:18 write it all out and it's very
02:14:20 fast very instantaneous
02:14:22 unless it's a huge
02:14:24 project in which case there's a lot of getting
02:14:26 up going outside smoking thinking of
02:14:28 the next sentence like you know
02:14:30 my favorite example would be the
02:14:32 psychopaths video because there's
02:14:34 you know it's broken up into five parts
02:14:36 and I remember distinctly when I
02:14:38 was working through the part where I was comparing
02:14:40 Makishima to the villain from season
02:14:42 two Kamui and I'm just
02:14:44 comparing these villains and like every paragraph
02:14:46 I had to like
02:14:48 go out think about it for a while
02:14:50 and like think of the perfect sentence
02:14:52 and then start the next paragraph and I just kept doing
02:14:54 that I just kept getting up and going out and thinking of the
02:14:56 next perfect sentence and then writing the next paragraph
02:14:58 and it was so fun time
02:15:00 you know out of all the videos I've written
02:15:02 and made there's only one where I think
02:15:04 I had kind of a pretty interesting to describe
02:15:06 writing process which was roller coaster
02:15:08 tycoon 3 where I
02:15:10 basically this was my method
02:15:12 I start talking about something that annoys
02:15:14 me or yeah something about that annoys
02:15:16 me about roller coaster tycoon 3
02:15:18 and any time I use the word
02:15:20 just as in
02:15:22 this is just annoying as in just fuck my
02:15:24 shit up fam as in
02:15:26 this is just ugly or like that right there is
02:15:28 just annoying any time
02:15:30 I felt the need to use the word just
02:15:32 I then blew up the just
02:15:34 into a whole paragraph of explaining
02:15:36 of justification and that
02:15:38 was how the whole thing eventually became
02:15:40 really long that's like just did
02:15:42 evolved into that's really interesting
02:15:44 actually
02:15:46 I was actually on a huge anti-just
02:15:48 kick I was super opposed
02:15:50 to the word just at the time
02:15:52 for that copier aware that just
02:15:54 just the all caps word just
02:15:56 is a big meme
02:15:58 it's a big meme so
02:16:00 yeah so
02:16:02 most of my writing happens like that
02:16:04 in these violent spurts
02:16:06 and it's also about figuring out what kind
02:16:08 of video is this gonna be it's like
02:16:10 the most important thing because
02:16:12 most other youtubers have a
02:16:14 defined structure like Nate you have
02:16:16 best anime ever it's always
02:16:18 kind of following this formula
02:16:20 where there's gonna be some kind of intro joke
02:16:22 there's gonna be and
02:16:24 as well you know there's gonna be
02:16:26 introductory sort of comedic scenario
02:16:28 then you're gonna introduce the topic
02:16:30 of the the the media
02:16:32 you know go through this and that all of mine
02:16:34 are so different that each one is like
02:16:36 it's really mostly about what
02:16:38 is the what is this video
02:16:40 like what is even is it is
02:16:42 it a retrospective
02:16:44 is it me like talking about
02:16:46 just cinematic techniques is it gonna be more
02:16:48 emotional is this gonna be personal
02:16:50 you know and the
02:16:52 hardest video ever to write
02:16:54 in that regard was aesthetic
02:16:56 is narrative because I had like
02:16:58 10 different ways I could have approached it
02:17:00 that were all totally different like some of
02:17:02 them were let's take one
02:17:04 picture and analyze that
02:17:06 picture in depth and that'll prove that aesthetic
02:17:08 is narrative and some of it was like well what if we
02:17:10 made it really broad and talked about it in the
02:17:12 way that like art can mean all these different
02:17:14 things and I just kind of ended up
02:17:16 combining all of them in the video it's like
02:17:18 20 minutes and it's broken up into like
02:17:20 all these different 5 minute sections of
02:17:22 just like exploring these different concepts
02:17:24 and it took forever to write
02:17:26 well I don't know how Gib feels about it
02:17:28 but I think it's a little bit inaccurate
02:17:30 to say that things are always the same
02:17:32 in our vids and rears are always
02:17:34 a totally different format because I mean they
02:17:36 follow the formula of you know converting
02:17:38 this text piece into video
02:17:40 like aesthetically they're very similar
02:17:42 in the way that they're done well sure and
02:17:44 I mean sure the topics are different I just
02:17:46 mean the approach
02:17:48 like yeah the approach I take is always the same
02:17:50 it's write it out all at once
02:17:52 and you can clearly tell my written voice
02:17:54 and you can tell it's me you know but
02:17:56 it's just that the most
02:17:58 important part of the whole writing process
02:18:00 is figuring out what it is
02:18:02 you know it's not about
02:18:04 like if you know you're gonna do like an
02:18:06 intro then it's about how am I
02:18:08 gonna do the intro you know what is
02:18:10 the joke gonna be how am I gonna stage
02:18:12 this introduction to
02:18:14 the video for me the
02:18:16 entire thing is
02:18:18 what the fuck is this video you know
02:18:20 is it an analysis is it not
02:18:22 is it a review is it
02:18:24 does it contain information about
02:18:26 the thing because I don't like to summarize
02:18:28 you know so something like the mob psycho 100
02:18:30 video is like
02:18:32 just analysis like it's
02:18:34 just a very bare bones here's
02:18:36 what's interesting about mob psycho
02:18:38 no real plot description except for where
02:18:40 it like you know where I can work it into
02:18:42 talking about the show but it kind of just starts
02:18:44 off like you know this is
02:18:46 this is what mob's character is like
02:18:48 and here's what Reagan's character is like
02:18:50 and that's that's cool you know
02:18:52 and so
02:18:54 figuring out what the video is gonna be
02:18:56 is like how that came together as opposed
02:18:58 to you know
02:19:00 where's the plot description gonna go where
02:19:02 am I gonna talk about characters and stuff like that
02:19:04 which I feel is more what a normal
02:19:06 review is like you know what
02:19:08 I think most people go into it like
02:19:10 there's gonna be a
02:19:12 description of the thing in there somewhere
02:19:14 I spent a lot of time
02:19:16 wondering about how I'm gonna work in my
02:19:18 x out of 10 you know at the end of the video
02:19:20 that's really important you gotta get that right
02:19:22 without that execution the whole video is pointless
02:19:24 yeah um I'm sure there's
02:19:26 a lot of people who for that is
02:19:28 entirely accurate
02:19:30 I'm sure it is
02:19:32 yeah so so that's how the
02:19:34 writing comes together for the ones that do
02:19:36 edits and then I just fucking I do the
02:19:38 audio I ship it off to him and it's done
02:19:40 and those are very much like
02:19:42 they're just in my mind they're just
02:19:44 text posts that are set to video
02:19:46 they're not videos in the
02:19:48 like strictest sense of the word they're not
02:19:50 constructed like with the
02:19:52 idea that they will be a video first
02:19:54 and I mean I incorporate a lot of elements
02:19:56 that I couldn't do in text you know
02:19:58 where there'll be unscripted segments like in
02:20:00 that high too many
02:20:02 anime high schoolers or whatever
02:20:04 you know there's a segment where it's just me in front of my
02:20:06 collection and I just use that
02:20:08 as an example I mean you do you have
02:20:10 evolved your writing style a lot
02:20:12 knowing that it's going to be
02:20:14 in the audio video format right like I
02:20:16 write but what did you mean
02:20:18 is he's not like thinking about like
02:20:20 how the video will be formatted like
02:20:22 with things that can only be done with
02:20:24 video with like live action segments
02:20:26 it's it's you know back in the
02:20:28 text blogging days you would have to
02:20:30 if you wanted to describe like
02:20:32 the way a scene plays out you
02:20:34 would have to like literally
02:20:36 describe what happens in the scene because
02:20:38 you can't show it I mean we would usually use
02:20:40 images and stuff and you know ghost
02:20:42 lightning innovated and you slide shows and stuff
02:20:44 like that but like you had to go into a
02:20:46 lot more description whereas now I can say
02:20:48 a sentence like you know
02:20:50 when animator Yutaka Nakamura
02:20:52 does a scene like this
02:20:54 and I say this and like in the
02:20:56 text post that is totally
02:20:58 unhelpful but in video
02:21:00 it's on screen so that's what I mean by this
02:21:02 course so like I do make
02:21:04 illustrations like that but for the most part
02:21:06 it's written like a blog post
02:21:08 that is being adapted into video
02:21:10 and I love that because I always wanted
02:21:12 back in the anime blogger days like we were
02:21:14 always saying wouldn't it be so much more helpful
02:21:16 if we could show you what the fuck we're talking about
02:21:18 you know like wouldn't it be so much more
02:21:20 helpful if I could just like when I say
02:21:22 you know Shinbo has
02:21:24 a weird aesthetic if I could actually
02:21:26 show the aesthetic you would get
02:21:28 it way more easily and like
02:21:30 that was something you know that me and ghost
02:21:32 lighting we're always saying like oh if only we could do
02:21:34 video and then suddenly we could do video
02:21:36 yeah not that he could exceed enough time
02:21:38 so like that's sort of where I come from
02:21:40 as opposed to coming from it like
02:21:42 like I feel like you guys more
02:21:44 come from I want to make a funny
02:21:46 video and you know the review
02:21:48 is more of a like
02:21:50 like a vehicle to make an entertaining
02:21:52 video I think of myself as
02:21:54 a film director personally yeah
02:21:56 exactly and I don't at all
02:21:58 but then the funny thing is
02:22:00 that I actually do take that
02:22:02 approach to all the other shit
02:22:04 I edit because I actually
02:22:06 it's funny I hate
02:22:08 editing as much as Tom but I only hate editing
02:22:10 when it's the scripts
02:22:12 that I'm doing when it's a video about
02:22:14 like what I'm you know giving to DeVoo
02:22:16 I enjoy editing when it's all just
02:22:18 making shit up on the fly when it's
02:22:20 like just finding solutions
02:22:22 when like the video is being created in the
02:22:24 editing because then it's about
02:22:26 of course creatively that makes it more
02:22:28 making something up so like my
02:22:30 vlogs there's a reason that
02:22:32 you know you might get a few more
02:22:34 random musical interludes or just like
02:22:36 weird things that pop up in the middle
02:22:38 of a vlog or something because it's like
02:22:40 it's a lot more fun to
02:22:42 problem solve there and
02:22:44 and you know I don't do a lot
02:22:46 I'm a big fan of the idea that
02:22:48 like even the smallest edit can change
02:22:50 things massively and I really picked that up from Jesse
02:22:52 where Jesse will do a video that's
02:22:54 ostensibly just a vlog
02:22:56 but then like there's one moment
02:22:58 where just the camera zooms in on his
02:23:00 face right when he drops something
02:23:02 and it's fucking hilarious you know
02:23:04 and it just totally changes the nature of
02:23:06 it even though it's such a minor edit in the
02:23:08 middle of what could be a 15 minute vlog
02:23:10 you know I mean
02:23:12 Plebe and the Weave is kind of edited that way
02:23:14 like most of it's just us talking but then he zooms
02:23:16 in on our faces at funny moments and puts
02:23:18 text on screen here and there and it totally
02:23:20 changes it into a much funnier product
02:23:22 or just those weird explosions
02:23:24 of things happening at parts and so
02:23:26 that's sort of the approach I take to like after
02:23:28 dark and to any more experimental
02:23:30 stuff I have is just I
02:23:32 take a bunch of footage and
02:23:34 just if there's anything I can do to it
02:23:36 I do it if there's not anything I don't care
02:23:38 I don't go into it like I don't go
02:23:40 into filming thinking this will
02:23:42 be edited into a joke later
02:23:44 I just film what I have and then when I'm watching
02:23:46 it back if there's something that I'm like oh that
02:23:48 would be hilarious you know then I'll put
02:23:50 it in there and so that's why it's very
02:23:52 inconsistent if you watch all the after dark
02:23:54 vlogs most of them are me talking into a camera
02:23:56 and then some of them suddenly have like all
02:23:58 this weird stuff happening and it's like
02:24:00 where did this come from
02:24:02 or suddenly it's a a work out
02:24:04 vlog where you know I have Victor filming
02:24:06 me working out and I've got like
02:24:08 I've got the anime playing on a
02:24:10 monitor that's sitting next to me on
02:24:12 a stool and then I've got
02:24:14 like three cameras set up in like
02:24:16 weird locations like to capture different
02:24:18 angles on it and you know
02:24:20 microphones like barely hidden out of
02:24:22 camera so like sometimes
02:24:24 one random video will
02:24:26 be like a totally new setup
02:24:28 it's nothing I've ever done before it's just like
02:24:30 completely inventing the
02:24:32 style of a new video just
02:24:34 for this one video and that's when editing is fun
02:24:36 that's when it's like all just
02:24:38 cool stuff and like how am I gonna make this
02:24:40 vision I have come together that's like
02:24:42 nothing I've ever done before
02:24:44 but none of it's ever too complicated
02:24:46 I'm more about that's right you know
02:24:48 all the all the like regular videos
02:24:50 that I make for the didgy bro channel
02:24:52 almost all the time it is
02:24:54 in as little
02:24:56 time as possible as efficiently as possible
02:24:58 getting to a normal acceptable
02:25:00 quality because that is the most
02:25:02 efficient for like being successful
02:25:04 and actually getting statements out there
02:25:06 but in the event that there is a video
02:25:08 that is like this mess
02:25:10 of different information lying
02:25:12 on the floor that you need to staple together
02:25:14 improvisationally
02:25:16 as you go which I only have
02:25:18 one big video like that which is my
02:25:20 debate with a commenter the story of Dow
02:25:22 which is like this video with like seven
02:25:24 different parts which I was writing
02:25:26 and recording and editing like as I
02:25:28 went through it out of order like I
02:25:30 completely did it out of order and I just
02:25:32 did it all in one hectic 24
02:25:34 hour editing writing
02:25:36 recording session in which I didn't sleep
02:25:38 and I barely ate because it was so
02:25:40 exciting like I feel like Nate for as much
02:25:42 work as you put into your videos
02:25:44 I feel like the percentage of time that you
02:25:46 spend being like tedious
02:25:48 out and just being like it's probably
02:25:50 lower than most people because
02:25:52 you give me the sense that you put a lot
02:25:54 of fun creativity into every moment of
02:25:56 it that's true it's certainly true yeah
02:25:58 I mean that's anytime it's more
02:26:00 a sense of despair looking at the timeline
02:26:02 and seeing like how much I accomplish today
02:26:04 and being like just let it right that's why
02:26:06 I eventually didn't go with that style like the
02:26:08 first like main like originally that is how
02:26:10 I went into videos whether or not I was good at the time
02:26:12 I did that whole every detail
02:26:14 of something I've poured over
02:26:16 style and if I got paid a million
02:26:18 dollars every time for that I would have never
02:26:20 broken away from it but
02:26:22 I mean but then I would love
02:26:24 to see what Nate would do if
02:26:26 you just made more stuff
02:26:28 like I can't fucking think of the
02:26:30 word or like what what Gibbon takes
02:26:32 whole channel is where it's like
02:26:34 it's just you have an idea
02:26:36 and you just like violently go
02:26:38 about it messily and you just
02:26:40 make it a thing and like that's because
02:26:42 the Dow video I can see where there's
02:26:44 lots of like weird inventive tricks
02:26:46 in there like the way you do text where like
02:26:48 there's these like these reveals
02:26:50 of text on the screen
02:26:52 and it's like all these slow
02:26:54 wipes like I can tell you had to time all that
02:26:56 out and think of how the text was going
02:26:58 to appear and I thought it was really cool and
02:27:00 it was like something that you know that's a technique
02:27:02 you just kind of came up with for that
02:27:04 video haven't really had to use again
02:27:06 but that's where it's the most
02:27:08 fun and I've done stuff like
02:27:10 the anime is getting lazy
02:27:12 with its meta video is like one of the last
02:27:14 ones that I edited that I like
02:27:16 really put effort into and it's
02:27:18 dirty as hell it is way grungy
02:27:20 images are just like flying
02:27:22 in and out of the screen at random there's all these
02:27:24 like weird low res things because
02:27:26 I love like the most fun to
02:27:28 me is when I do like really multimedia
02:27:30 visuals when I grab like
02:27:32 you know footage
02:27:34 from real life and then footage from
02:27:36 anime and then images and then like
02:27:38 weird pictures and like it all kind of
02:27:40 coalesces in this like maelstrom and
02:27:42 it's ugly but it's a lot of fun
02:27:44 to do to have like weird
02:27:46 footage and my favorite
02:27:48 and this is this is the most
02:27:50 like ever that I had an idea that way
02:27:52 outstripped my ability to execute it
02:27:54 is where I'm trying to say
02:27:56 a tidal wave of light novels
02:27:58 crashes over and I just
02:28:00 I took footage of a
02:28:02 tidal wave like you know crashing over
02:28:04 Japan which is not as easy to find
02:28:06 as you would think like to have one that was
02:28:08 like actually at the shore like most
02:28:10 of it's in city so I wanted one that was
02:28:12 like the waves actually coming onto the beach
02:28:14 and
02:28:16 the problem with it is that the camera
02:28:18 moves in this shot so
02:28:20 like you know if it was just a stationary
02:28:22 shot of waves coming in it would be really easy to keyframe
02:28:24 and animate a bunch of light novels
02:28:26 you know surfing up over the shore
02:28:28 but unfortunately the cameras moving
02:28:30 so I have to constantly change the
02:28:32 perspective of all the light novels and
02:28:34 like each one has to be like
02:28:36 halfway poking out of the water
02:28:38 and they have to be moving on like
02:28:40 the same kind of speed it was
02:28:42 a nightmare like it was way beyond
02:28:44 what I could do way way way
02:28:46 beyond like trying to measure out every
02:28:48 keyframe to match the camera movement was
02:28:50 fucking impossible even if that was
02:28:52 like five seconds long doing every
02:28:54 frame for like I don't know exactly
02:28:56 it took too much it took like
02:28:58 I think it was ten
02:29:00 seconds of clip and it took like
02:29:02 two hours to do and it looks
02:29:04 like shit you know like two that's
02:29:06 two hours to get it to even the
02:29:08 level that I was willing to go
02:29:10 and you can clearly see everything looks
02:29:12 like a fucking mess and it's ugly as
02:29:14 hell but it was a lot of fun
02:29:16 like to have that idea and
02:29:18 to just go and do it you know
02:29:20 and I'm sure if Nate had done the same idea
02:29:22 he would have executed it all the way
02:29:24 and edited that for two fucking days
02:29:26 until it was perfect it is what I do
02:29:28 like there that it's definitely
02:29:30 that's when editing is the most fun
02:29:32 is when you have this vision of something
02:29:34 that you have to like completely invent
02:29:36 how it's going to be made and
02:29:38 you know even if it looks like
02:29:40 shit at least it was fun to do
02:29:42 like with the whole girl login
02:29:44 part one I just came up with that whole
02:29:46 motion thing and yeah
02:29:48 I think the only time I actually had fun
02:29:50 editing was
02:29:52 editing tale the smartest pony man
02:29:54 it was when
02:29:56 everyone was proven wrong and edited all
02:29:58 the comments oh right yeah
02:30:00 you were so right about that yeah it was awesome
02:30:02 that was the best video ever
02:30:04 that was the one time I edited with a smile on my face
02:30:06 because the fuck you I've been waiting years
02:30:08 for
02:30:10 I forget what was the event that transpired
02:30:12 just reminds me it was when
02:30:14 the little princess bitch was born
02:30:16 and she was born in Alicorn and they were both
02:30:18 we don't fucking know how that shit happened
02:30:20 and for like three years I've been
02:30:22 heckled for my position on that
02:30:24 completely contradicts other things we've
02:30:26 learned in the series but it's all
02:30:28 out the window so whatever
02:30:30 it was a good
02:30:32 a lot of the time when I'm
02:30:34 and then it was a bad day
02:30:36 fuck off everybody
02:30:38 I only really like editing
02:30:40 when
02:30:42 I can make myself laugh by a joke
02:30:44 like if I've got a joke going
02:30:46 and I play it back and it's like yeah
02:30:48 yeah then I have
02:30:50 the power to continue for the day
02:30:52 but a lot of the time it's just like
02:30:54 oh it didn't work I did all that
02:30:56 preparation the recording the live action
02:30:58 the putting all the things in there and it
02:31:00 just falls flat so sometimes I just have to
02:31:02 delete it it's really annoying
02:31:04 the joke you did recently give that I really liked
02:31:06 was in the Rayman video was when
02:31:08 you're talking about the game and then you
02:31:10 you stop and you turn and it goes
02:31:12 with the other camera angle you make your next point
02:31:14 then you just stare at the camera for a while
02:31:16 and you're like that was a joke
02:31:18 that's why I changed the angle
02:31:20 you just you hold on that and like
02:31:22 spell it all out and it takes like
02:31:24 20 seconds to do
02:31:26 I'm gonna be honest
02:31:28 didn't care for that joke
02:31:30 thought it went on way too long
02:31:32 that's what made it funny was that it was
02:31:34 awkwardly long
02:31:36 so I went through the like giggle initially
02:31:38 and then the like okay let's move on
02:31:40 and then the like secondary oh okay he's doing it too
02:31:42 and then it just kept going
02:31:44 I laughed harder the longer it went
02:31:46 alright sure enough
02:31:48 so you know what I was gonna say about the whole uh getting bored thing
02:31:50 um the great thing about
02:31:52 having uh like doing things the way
02:31:54 I do where I put my my music down
02:31:56 and then I edit uh
02:31:58 visuals after I've got that laid in
02:32:00 um like the like the video I'm currently doing
02:32:02 like I already know
02:32:04 where all like the emotional
02:32:06 uh fucking hits are gonna come
02:32:08 and I've got it all mapped out
02:32:10 so like at the end of the day I have a ritual I sort of do
02:32:12 at the beginning of editing at the end of editing
02:32:14 I just watch everything I've done from the very start
02:32:16 and like I can see it starting to develop
02:32:18 and it feels so good
02:32:20 funny thing about that because
02:32:22 Davoo was saying that like with
02:32:24 the current stream of videos he's been editing
02:32:26 for me he has not been watching them
02:32:28 back at all like at no point
02:32:30 in the editing because he knows that
02:32:32 I'm gonna watch it. It's half the time
02:32:34 half the time I just I'm already
02:32:36 tired of it before I even watch it back
02:32:38 but the other half like the shinbo ones those are more
02:32:40 complicated I do need to watch those back
02:32:42 well like yeah with the uh like
02:32:44 the girl in the gun and shiro bako
02:32:46 and anime and high school ones
02:32:48 like he finished and then he called me over
02:32:50 and like I sat down and watched it he just fucked off
02:32:52 to another room like and I just
02:32:54 watched the video like you know if I didn't have any
02:32:56 complaints then then what does it matter
02:32:58 to him you know like because he's editing it for me
02:33:00 I'm the client so like uh
02:33:02 you know and I usually have like one or two things I want
02:33:04 him to change he changes those things doesn't even
02:33:06 watch it back which fascinates me because
02:33:08 I watch back what I'm editing
02:33:10 constantly like
02:33:12 every time I do like
02:33:14 even if it's a long video I'll watch
02:33:16 back like the whole fucking
02:33:18 right now I'm in the middle of a
02:33:20 fairly inventive editing
02:33:22 not well I won't say it's inventive but it's different
02:33:24 for what I usually do
02:33:26 for like this kind of unscripted
02:33:28 um vlog thing
02:33:30 where I'm splicing in lots of stuff and like
02:33:32 just to check the flow I'll like
02:33:34 watch like 20 minutes
02:33:36 of an hour long video back just to see like
02:33:38 do I think this feels right
02:33:40 you know like do I like how these clips
02:33:42 are cutting in or like you know or
02:33:44 do I just like the rhythm of how I talk
02:33:46 even like my totally unedited vlogs
02:33:48 I usually watch a few times before I post
02:33:50 them um and so
02:33:52 like yeah I just I really want to know
02:33:54 I want to know exactly what I'm posting
02:33:56 I want to know it
02:33:58 down to the core so that
02:34:00 you know if I look back at it I'll
02:34:02 immediately recognize it and not have to like
02:34:04 especially for comments and discussion
02:34:06 because when there's a video I haven't
02:34:08 seen as much then like people will
02:34:10 bring it up and I'll be like what I don't
02:34:12 even fucking remember saying that you know
02:34:14 yeah yeah so
02:34:16 I want to have a good grasp of what I've been talking
02:34:18 about recently it makes sense though that
02:34:20 Davoo doesn't I mean since he knows
02:34:22 someone else is going to be reviewing he has the luxury
02:34:24 of you know just not worrying about as much
02:34:26 I remember
02:34:28 something I was going to say about the
02:34:30 being happy when you're editing
02:34:32 whenever I'm editing like a
02:34:34 stupid joke video for give and take like
02:34:36 um the one I did
02:34:38 about the you should
02:34:40 why you should vote thing I had the
02:34:42 idea of like the thumbnail is just boring
02:34:44 but the video itself is weird
02:34:46 and that that I made that
02:34:48 like real quick before the election
02:34:50 was over because the election was going on at the time
02:34:52 and I was like my
02:34:54 I was smiling the whole way through it was like
02:34:56 yeah yeah it was so cool
02:34:58 and that's that's why
02:35:00 I wish give and take was the most popular
02:35:02 channel ever because
02:35:04 I would get so much money
02:35:06 I have moments where I'm like
02:35:08 should I just start putting
02:35:10 better thumbnails on Digibra after dark
02:35:12 and just try like part of
02:35:14 me doesn't want the channel to grow because
02:35:16 I like that I can do whatever I want
02:35:18 there's no expectations and the comments
02:35:20 aren't total shit most of the time
02:35:22 but like you know
02:35:24 all I'd have to do is like give it nice
02:35:26 thumbnails and that channel would
02:35:28 would blow up and it already has 50,000 subscribers
02:35:30 but like it could be
02:35:32 it could be like Ethan and Hila where like
02:35:34 they their side channel became as big as
02:35:36 the main one eventually
02:35:38 there's always a temptation because I'm like
02:35:40 man wouldn't it be fun to switch to
02:35:42 just being this like fucking
02:35:44 unhinged oboe vlogger
02:35:46 you know
02:35:48 but um you know I kind of value
02:35:50 the the main channel
02:35:52 and I like having a place
02:35:54 where I can dump literally whatever
02:35:56 the fuck I want and nobody
02:35:58 will question it too hard
02:36:00 yeah that's pretty important
02:36:02 to have I mean because if you did that
02:36:04 I'm sure you would just make another channel
02:36:06 where you could post things that you really don't give a shit about
02:36:08 and it would just go on forever
02:36:10 I even had like I've had a few times
02:36:12 where like I actually
02:36:14 had to debate like is this
02:36:16 so shit that it shouldn't even go
02:36:18 on Digibra after dark
02:36:20 should just be on
02:36:22 Modal Soul you know
02:36:26 I love these tier lists of like
02:36:28 I mean it actually was like because originally
02:36:30 originally after dark was not
02:36:32 just anything it was like
02:36:34 just stuff that wasn't for the main channel
02:36:36 so like I did have my old channel
02:36:38 Modal Soul Productions where I'd post like weird music videos
02:36:40 and stuff but then eventually I was like
02:36:42 you know what like I want these
02:36:44 weird music videos to actually have some audience
02:36:46 so fuck it fuck everyone
02:36:48 who subscribes to Digibra after dark
02:36:50 if they can't take it you know like this this channel
02:36:52 is for the powerful it's not for
02:36:54 people who are going to meekly unsubscribe
02:36:56 because a weird rap video that says
02:36:58 nigger 200 times showed up you know
02:37:02 agreed
02:37:04 so uh are we done here
02:37:06 are we all wrapped up? yeah I think so
02:37:08 he's been going for quite a while
02:37:10 I guess I should have known
02:37:12 yeah I suppose
02:37:14 any time that we do one that's like each of us talk
02:37:16 about a thing on our own
02:37:18 it always ends up being too long
02:37:20 well we didn't know Davoo was going to be here until
02:37:22 like the last minute so like I had kind of thought
02:37:24 we're short we only have four people
02:37:26 and I demanded to go on because this is the first time
02:37:28 in like 20 episodes
02:37:30 I really cared to be on an episode
02:37:32 because god damn it my couch
