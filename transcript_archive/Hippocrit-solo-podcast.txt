00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another solo podcast on The Pro Crastinators Channel.
00:00:06 I am The Hippocrit and I've never really been that good at doing solos, but I feel, you know, practice makes good.
00:00:16 So I'm gonna make one and the first solo I want to talk about is Led Zeppelins, something or other.
00:00:24 I think Celebration Day is the song, I forget the name, but it sort of goes like this.
00:00:30 So that's the solo, it's quite short and it's quite difficult.
00:00:48 Obviously that wasn't the first take, I'm not that good.
00:00:51 But yeah, I really like this song, it's very upbeat, it's very bouncy, it's very quick and fast, and it's fun to play.
00:00:58 The reason I like Led Zeppelin so much is because their guitar bits are just, you know, really cool to listen to, but so fun to play.
00:01:07 Like getting down a solo from Led Zeppelins, like the coolest feeling in the world.
00:01:12 And not even just like the guitar solos, Led Zeppelin and all the musicians, their solos are great and they're fun to play.
00:01:19 And that's the thing, the thesis behind a lot of Led Zeppelin songs at least.
00:01:24 It feels like they're just always having a good time trying to do as much cool shit as possible.
00:01:28 And it's like, yeah, yeah, 20 minutes solo that just keeps going and it's cool and it's fast and it's energetic and it's great.
00:01:34 And that's the only one I can really do.
00:01:37 There's, you know, there's Stairway to Heaven, which I never really figured out.
00:01:42 It's probably not as difficult as that one that I just played, but it's like, what does it go like?
00:01:50 I need to turn the distortion off for this, hang on.
00:01:54 A lot of the time I can't remember what a song goes like and how it leads into things without playing it.
00:02:12 And then it does the...
00:02:42 ...
00:03:06 Yeah, it's uh...
00:03:11 I mean, it's fun to to to imagine the solo. It's not it sounds terrible when you say it with your mouth
00:03:17 But I I've never figured that out
00:03:20 But soloing is like it's it's cool. It's great and I love solos and there's lots of solos I like but I I don't know many
00:03:29 Yeah, I guess this really was a pointless podcast if I had more solos to show off
00:03:33 That would be cool. I
00:03:36 Can make up things in like a in a thing let me turn distortion back on
00:03:41 Oh
00:04:11 Oh
00:04:41 You
00:04:54 See that's not really a solo, but it is a riff I could do a podcast on riffs. I love riffs too fucking guitars are cool
00:05:02 Um
00:05:05 Yes
00:05:06 Yeah, I like guitar that the entire joke was I was gonna say I it's a solo podcast and then it's a
00:05:14 literal about music
00:05:16 solos
00:05:17 When you really you would think oh, it's just a one person in a podcast and that that was the joke
00:05:23 But now I'm standing here with a guitar and I just want to place things
00:05:26 I'm gonna play some things and tell you what I like. I like things. I like stuff
00:05:30 I like
00:05:34 Let's think of distortion stuff like what's good right like like really what's good like
00:05:40 That's that's a powerful chunky little chunky little power sound, you know all of those
00:05:47 I'm trying to think of like
00:06:00 Oh
00:06:30 Oh
00:07:01 Oh
00:07:04 Never really quite get that bit I always forget it says who's one of those things, you know
00:07:09 Yeah, jeez. How's this? How's this gonna work?
00:07:12 I'm gonna have to compress this to fuck if I'm gonna make my voice sound like it's you know
00:07:16 The right volume level compared to all the stuff I'm doing
00:07:21 What else is cool? Um I
00:07:24 Can't play back in black even though I really want to because I don't know
00:07:29 Some of you might know that I played back black in back in black
00:07:33 Just with an acoustic guitar by myself in a video on Gibbentate channel
00:07:38 And he got taken down for content ID
00:07:40 They know those chords and they fucking took it down. It was annoying
00:07:47 Let's just make up a solo let's go all the way up here and then it's just
00:07:52 Oh, yeah, I'm playing a song this goes
00:07:59 I'm gay essay is a fucking stupid song and then it's like oh, yeah, and then you go all the way up here and it's like
00:08:06 I
00:08:26 I'm not good at solos, but I can I tried my best. That's not good
00:08:35 I know what I've just remembered this is one
00:09:06 I
00:09:25 Was a cool little bit I was like that. What do you call it a lick? Do you call that a lick?
00:09:35 I
00:09:46 Don't know how that goes. I don't know a lot of songs
00:09:50 I know some parts of lots of songs. I don't know whole songs, you know
00:09:54 I get I get tired of looking up tabs tabs suck. Fuck tabs. They're gay. I can't read them
00:10:01 I mean I can but I don't like them. It's like it takes like 40 minutes to read a tab
00:10:05 I probably would take longer for me to read notes because I don't know how to read those at all
00:10:09 I just listen I listen and figure it out. I guess
00:10:12 Oh, I'm I'm gay
00:10:35 Oh
00:10:37 Oh
00:10:39 Oh
00:11:03 Wow
00:11:09 Oh
00:11:35 Oh
00:11:39 Oh
00:11:40 I can't sing I hate that the reason I haven't made any music is because whenever it comes to singing and lyrics
00:11:47 I fail. I'm just bad at it. I don't know what to do
00:11:52 Text to speech maybe
00:12:09 Oh
00:12:17 And I'm here
00:12:24 Now I'm there
00:12:32 It's just
00:12:40 I
00:12:42 This podcast is not even real. I'm gonna cut out everything
00:13:09 I
00:13:39 I
00:14:10 Really I don't know what I'm doing here
00:14:14 I guess I'm showing off, but I'm not really good at that because I don't prepare for anything. I don't I don't plan
00:14:21 For like what I could talk about. I don't have anything up on the screen to reference
00:14:25 It's really a shit show and I never do it. I never plan. I never do any planning for anything
00:14:30 Every podcast I go on to every PCP. I just jump in and have try to think of something while everyone else is talking
00:14:36 And then I say it and if I don't have anything to say then it's nothing's coming out
00:14:42 Even on the podcast like I read the chapter once
00:14:46 Nate reads it like a million times and he takes notes and then he comes in and does the thing and he has like stuff to say
00:14:53 I'm just like
00:14:55 I'm I'm a lazy
00:14:57 I'm uh
00:14:59 It wouldn't be cool if I knew lazy by deep purple and then transitioned into that
00:15:03 That would be a great fucking thing, but I don't know how to play it. Oh, I fucking hate
00:15:09 This this this almost talent this almost skill
00:15:14 Like it's pretty good. I admit. I know how to do some things
00:15:20 But gosh darn it. It's not always great. It's not always the sort of thing that would make somebody say wow
00:15:27 You know you say wow because oh, I didn't know he had guitar talent not oh wow
00:15:33 His guitar talent is really good and I would like to hear music from him
00:15:40 Like I'm I'm just mediocre enough
00:15:44 To be uh, whatever
00:16:03 I try to do things, but I don't work out
00:16:14 I'm really annoyed with my current output
00:16:21 It doesn't seem to get better only seems to get worse
00:16:30 Soon I'll be in a hearse
00:16:33 I
00:17:03 I
00:17:07 Don't like you you smell like poop
00:17:13 See that's what I mean when I fucking can't lyrics
00:17:16 I know you're not supposed to come up with them off the cuff
00:17:19 But I can't come up with lyrics and then put them on a song that I already made because I can't really make a song without lyrics
00:17:26 To to structure it and I don't know fucking how to do any of this
00:17:30 I hate music and I wish I could make an album and it's hard and I don't know how to do it
00:17:34 I don't really know what to do
00:17:36 I can't stay on beat with myself
00:17:38 I tried like playing guitar and then playing bass and it wasn't the same speed
00:17:42 So what would you fucking everybody just has to do it in fruity loops and make not real instrument noises
00:17:48 But I don't like using a computer when I'm making music. I hate music editing
00:17:52 It's the worst thing in the world just sitting there with hunched over
00:17:56 Trying to like sit on a chair with a guitar so that it's close enough to the microphone
00:18:00 Fucking it's it's fucking the worst. I mean and now I have a microphone arm
00:18:04 So I can stand up and play like right now, which is it's great
00:18:07 I could probably make an album now just because I have a microphone arm
00:18:10 So I don't have to sit down while playing anything, but it's just I fucking hate it
00:18:14 I fucking hate everything about music production
00:18:17 I hate the sitting with the the headphones listening to something and then trying to play along
00:18:22 With another instrument. It's impossible. It's impossible and no one has ever done it and no one will ever do it ever
00:18:29 It sucks. I hate fruity loops because it's entirely that you don't have anything in your hands
00:18:34 You're just clicking you're just clicking and putting notes in various places and then listening to it
00:18:39 And yeah, it's you know, it's cool, but I hate it. I hate that process of making things
00:18:46 Digitally
00:18:47 It doesn't appeal to me as a person who plays guitar
00:18:51 Because the whole reason I like playing guitar is because I'm holding something and I'm going
00:18:57 You know, I'm going dilly dilly dilly with my fingers and it's great. That's fun
00:19:03 It's like the difference of like shooting a gun in a game and shooting a gun for real
00:19:07 Like I've never shot a gun, but I can imagine people who actually play, you know
00:19:12 Own guns and go to gun ranges and shoot
00:19:15 Like stuff
00:19:16 They they know the difference and it's very, you know, it's it's a different sort of feeling
00:19:22 I'm not saying that digital music is bad. Obviously. It's great
00:19:26 It's just I can't do it and it's so difficult as a single person to make a music without
00:19:33 Fucking using extensive digital
00:19:36 shit
00:19:38 I don't know what to do about it. It sucks
00:19:42 God damn it
00:19:45 Damn it god
00:19:58 Like I wish it was as easy as just like walking up to a thing going boom boom boom on the drum
00:20:04 And then switching over to the guitar and going. Oh, yeah, I'm listening to the it's just difficult
00:20:09 I wish I was in a band, but I don't know any human beings. I don't know anyone. No one is in a band that I know
00:20:16 No one is even playing music. I don't know anybody. There's no one in the world that I know
00:20:21 That lives nearby nearby at all
00:20:25 I don't know any human beings in my country
00:20:28 Because I just you know school friends fucking drift it apart
00:20:33 I don't keep up with them. It will be weird to just say. Hey, is anybody in a fucking you need a guitarist
00:20:38 I don't fucking know. Well, how do you meet band people just go to places
00:20:44 It's fucking
00:20:46 I don't get it
00:20:48 I don't get it at all. I hate I hate everything
00:20:58 I
00:21:29 The city of no one nobody knows me and that's all my fault
00:21:42 I try to be cool
00:21:45 I try to be awesome, but on the internet
00:21:51 Fuck you these lyrics
00:21:53 Wait, am I trying to be like
00:21:54 Suddenly like oh poetic at the end
00:21:58 I don't know how to play this song. It's bad. It's it was no bad song. I'm bad at it
00:22:28 Hey
00:22:33 Oops
00:22:39 And I hate me baby
00:22:42 And I hate me
00:22:49 And I hate it
00:22:52 Yeah
00:23:08 I made a mistake
00:23:12 Everybody's gay everybody's really gay
00:23:16 Maybe even me everybody's super gay. That's the way it's gonna stay
00:23:25 And then they go I forget how it goes to this
00:23:46 Oh
00:24:16 Oh
00:24:46 And she's buying
00:24:50 A siggy stardust
00:24:54 In walmart

00:26:04 American boy
00:26:07 I don't like you. You don't like me. I've got nothing else to say. I'm really gay
00:26:13 I'm gay american boy
00:26:18 I'm really
00:26:30 Yeah, I clicked the clip the mic quite a little bit. Uh, well, uh, that's how it's gonna end
