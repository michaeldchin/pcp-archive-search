00:00:00 I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.
00:00:03 That son of a bitch.
00:00:04 Son of a bitch.
00:00:05 Son of a bitch.
00:00:06 Son of a bitch.
00:00:07 Son of a bitch.
00:00:08 Son of a bitch.
00:00:09 Son of a bitch.
00:00:10 Son of a bitch.
00:00:11 Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.
00:00:12 Okay, so right now it starts.
00:00:15 Now this is the official beginning of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:20 I am Ben Saint and I have to introduce myself because as who are these podcasts tells us
00:00:28 if you do not have a theme song and the hosts do not introduce themselves, that is a Cinema
00:00:35 Sins ding on your podcast because that's what podcasts are supposed to do.
00:00:41 I have with me today a reborn pyro from Shreddit.
00:00:47 Hello.
00:00:48 Hello everyone.
00:00:51 And Advil also from Shreddit?
00:00:54 No.
00:00:55 Advil from Advil.
00:00:57 Advil from Advil.
00:00:58 I'm sorry, excuse me.
00:01:00 Pardon me.
00:01:01 Pardon.
00:01:02 You guys want to introduce yourselves again for anyone who doesn't know?
00:01:06 Yeah, so my name is Reborn Pyro.
00:01:08 I am one of the four hosts of Shredditors along with Aspoy, Lumia, and Kai the Kitty Lewis.
00:01:14 Yes, you were on one other time.
00:01:17 Yes, sir.
00:01:18 A few months ago, I think.
00:01:20 We make fun of Reddit and that's about it.
00:01:23 I mean, we have a new guest every week, a new wacky Zany guest.
00:01:27 It brings a lot of diversity to the table, unique thoughts, unique pallet of cringe,
00:01:33 and every week we tear into a new subreddit.
00:01:37 Yes, I was on the one about the cheating, the r slash cheating subreddit about people
00:01:44 who are like, oh man, ever since I discovered cheating on my wife, my life has just been
00:01:50 so much cooler.
00:01:52 Why didn't anyone think of this before?
00:01:56 The new meta unlocked.
00:01:58 Or that one lady who was like, I put an upside down pie up with my shopping cart.
00:02:03 Why am I not getting laid?
00:02:05 Yeah, it's a universal symbol.
00:02:08 What was the other episode that I was on?
00:02:11 Confessions.
00:02:13 Just confessions in general?
00:02:16 Yeah, where the guy had a dream about calling Obama the n-word.
00:02:20 Oh, yeah.
00:02:22 Wait, actually?
00:02:24 Yeah, that one was like, he's like, hey guys, I'm like liberal, I swear.
00:02:31 But I keep dreaming, having dreams where I call Obama the n-word.
00:02:35 I'm not racist or anything.
00:02:37 What does this mean?
00:02:39 That guy needs to get off cod, I swear.
00:02:42 He needs something for sure.
00:02:48 It sounds like I'm implying something, but I genuinely don't know what it is.
00:02:52 A therapist?
00:02:54 Perhaps, I mean, who among us couldn't use a little therapy once in a while?
00:03:00 That is 100% fair.
00:03:02 Yeah.
00:03:04 Yeah, so the shreddit, funny shit over there.
00:03:11 What's going on? What do we want to talk about?
00:03:13 What do we got on the docket to discuss this week for PCP stuff?
00:03:20 What do you guys want to talk about?
00:03:22 I'll throw the ball to you.
00:03:25 We should let Advil introduce himself.
00:03:28 Oh, did I not? Ah, shit, sorry.
00:03:30 No, you're cool, man.
00:03:32 I'm Advil.
00:03:34 No, it's not okay.
00:03:36 I'm so stupid.
00:03:38 That's what I thought.
00:03:41 That's what I thought, yeah.
00:03:43 No, I'm Advil, I make commentary-esque videos.
00:03:48 I like devolving into a topic that a lot of people have talked about or researched
00:03:54 and then just kind of finding out stuff about people who have a specific image.
00:04:02 Okay, commentary, commentary, gotcha, gotcha.
00:04:06 My next video is about shreddits, so make sure to stay tuned.
00:04:10 Are you going to roast shreddit?
00:04:12 Yeah, A, Reborn Pyro.
00:04:16 Are you going to cancel Reborn Pyro?
00:04:18 Oh no, oh no.
00:04:20 Yes, finally.
00:04:22 Finally, someone's got to take him down a peg.
00:04:25 No.
00:04:28 Pyro said you were like the social media manager?
00:04:32 No, that was Marin.
00:04:34 Marin we were going to have on.
00:04:36 Oh, yeah, you're right.
00:04:38 Yeah, that's right, that's right.
00:04:40 We stole two employees from the PC.
00:04:42 Marin was going to be on, but he couldn't make it.
00:04:46 We have stolen two employees from you.
00:04:49 We stole Nate's editor and we have stolen your Minecraft guy, Gitfuckdab.
00:04:55 Nate's editor is no need, bro, right?
00:04:58 Yes, he is also our editor.
00:05:01 Well, you know, fucking SaberSpark64 also stole Eleazar.
00:05:08 Oh shit.
00:05:10 And the editing scene for YouTube channels that have PCP members on them
00:05:20 sure is just a big incestuous like everybody's fucking editing for everybody clusterfuckdab.
00:05:26 You guys are the mob bus.
00:05:29 You just kind of disperse equally against like every YouTube channel out there.
00:05:34 I think so.
00:05:35 It's like your people.
00:05:37 They had, yeah, the SaberSpark64 was getting edited by, it was Eleazar,
00:05:45 DuneCoon from the Proanon, KaijuCoon of being an artist fame,
00:05:53 and there's one other one.
00:05:56 I think there was another one who I'm forgetting, but it's another person who is in the sphere.
00:06:02 I just thought it was really funny that they poached our editor.
00:06:07 Oh, and I think maybe No Need Bro was the other one.
00:06:11 Yeah.
00:06:13 Fuck.
00:06:14 Sorry.
00:06:15 I lost the thread.
00:06:16 What's happening?
00:06:17 Where am I?
00:06:18 All right.
00:06:19 So one of my shows called the PCP.
00:06:21 Yeah.
00:06:22 Yeah.
00:06:23 So we were talking about this before the episode started, but I just want to bring it back up.
00:06:30 Oh yeah.
00:06:31 Riley is a fucking coward.
00:06:33 I do not give a shit.
00:06:34 I made you delete your tweets, you little fucking rat goblin.
00:06:38 Run to Trixie and tell her about how the big mean shred it made you delete everything.
00:06:43 Fuck you.
00:06:44 You fucking...
00:06:45 So he was...
00:06:48 Let's back up a little bit.
00:06:50 All right.
00:06:51 Let's give a little context for this.
00:06:53 This was in the fallout of Trixie's, I would say, instant classic post about her appearance on
00:07:03 The Who Are These Podcasts, in which she appears on the show to bring up the PCP.
00:07:11 They are very on procrastinator's podcast as a subject of ridicule and mockery, and
00:07:19 spends like 20 minutes, 20 plus minutes or so, trying to convince the hosts that like,
00:07:27 the PCP fucking sucks, man.
00:07:29 The PCP is fucking stupid as hell.
00:07:37 There's a lot of angles to this thing that happened.
00:07:41 There's the angle of the fact that even the hosts who seem to be friendly with her and
00:07:48 seem to know her from outside the show, even they don't seem impressed and at certain times
00:07:56 they just make fun of her and tell her like, you're not being funny, please be funnier.
00:08:01 God fucking imagine being told that.
00:08:04 Complain funnier, quote, complain funnier was what he told her.
00:08:09 Holy shit.
00:08:11 Yeah.
00:08:12 He said, are you zugocking the podcast?
00:08:16 And I think zugock is a reference to some other guests that they had that everyone agreed
00:08:20 wasn't funny and just had an axe to grind.
00:08:24 Are you zugocking the podcast?
00:08:26 Please complain funnier.
00:08:28 And then there's the aspect of what she actually said.
00:08:32 Her complaints were all like, they were all like extremely like minor and like huge reaches.
00:08:39 Like she said like, Ben literally can't speak.
00:08:44 And like, okay.
00:08:46 And then you?
00:08:48 I don't know.
00:08:50 I don't know anymore.
00:08:53 So confused.
00:08:54 Advil, do you watch the PCP?
00:08:55 I mean, are you familiar at all?
00:08:57 Yeah, I'm, I watched.
00:08:59 So I got, I got told that I was going to come on here.
00:09:04 And so I was like, okay, I'll just, I'll watch a few episodes while I'm editing.
00:09:08 Okay.
00:09:09 And I watched, oh fuck, I completely forgot that guy's name, but I'll try to figure it out.
00:09:16 But yeah, I watched a few.
00:09:18 Wait, which guy?
00:09:19 The, um, let me try to find it.
00:09:22 I completely, I think I watched the fit emcee one.
00:09:25 Oh, that's a pretty old one.
00:09:27 Yeah, because I just really like fit.
00:09:29 Oh, sure.
00:09:30 Makes bangers.
00:09:31 But, uh, okay.
00:09:33 I found it.
00:09:34 I watched another one.
00:09:35 I forgot, but yeah.
00:09:36 Fair enough.
00:09:37 Fair enough.
00:09:38 Good shit.
00:09:39 Thank you.
00:09:40 Um, it's, uh, uh, what was it?
00:09:43 What was it going to say?
00:09:44 Oh, yeah.
00:09:45 Okay.
00:09:46 The, the other aspect was like that, like so many of the things that Trixie brings up
00:09:50 on who are these podcasts to like call us bad at are things that like notably she is worse
00:09:57 at than us.
00:09:58 For instance, there's a, there's much made about the fact that I joke about only reading
00:10:02 that Henry Kissinger book one page at a time while I'm shitting.
00:10:06 And she's like, Ben doesn't read.
00:10:09 Ben doesn't know how to read books.
00:10:11 And then later on Gibb, we're talking about cowboy towns and like, where do people live
00:10:16 in the cowboy, in, in old Western cowboy towns?
00:10:19 And Trixie makes a big deal of like, why did they bring this up on the podcast without
00:10:23 reading a book?
00:10:24 Why don't they just read a book about it?
00:10:26 Why wouldn't they read a book about it before they say something stupid when, you know,
00:10:31 like anyone who knows Trixie from, from, you know, a while back at least will remember
00:10:36 that like kind of a whole thing about her was that she refused to read books and that
00:10:40 she said like, I'll never read a book.
00:10:43 I just want a YouTube video to summarize it for me.
00:10:45 Oh, she forgot her character.
00:10:46 Oh no.
00:10:47 Like everybody, like everybody knows, everybody who knows her knows that she is like that.
00:10:52 And yet here she is.
00:10:54 She says, okay, she brings up the old like, she brings up the old thing about like, haha,
00:10:59 everybody quit the, everybody quit the show because Ben and Gibb are such insane leftoids.
00:11:04 And like, she knows why she quit the podcast and she knows that it, that's not the reason.
00:11:12 But she's bringing it up as like a, I really think she's bringing that one up just because
00:11:16 she thinks these guys will not like that because these are like Dick show adjacent, like rightoid
00:11:21 libertarians or whatever.
00:11:23 And so, so there's all the, so there's like so many of the things she brings up are hypocritical,
00:11:28 which is very weird.
00:11:29 And then the last thing that's notable is she starts right off the bat with a, with a jab
00:11:34 at like Gibb's voice and how Gibb's voice like doesn't pass.
00:11:39 She says something like, or she, she says it doesn't pass.
00:11:42 She says something like, like, yeah, Gibb is a trans woman, though you'd never know from
00:11:46 her voice.
00:11:47 And she's like, chuckles about it.
00:11:50 And, and this, and that's another like one, why would you say that two, like glass houses,
00:11:59 three, fuck you.
00:12:02 And then on everybody, everybody noticed this on Twitter and everybody called her out and,
00:12:06 and she like, she couldn't keep her story straight.
00:12:08 Once sometimes she would say, oh no, I wasn't trying to be insulting.
00:12:11 No, that wasn't an insult.
00:12:13 That was just me clarifying.
00:12:15 So the host would know.
00:12:16 And then to other people who were like, that's a hurtful thing to say.
00:12:20 She said, no, no, no, I only meant, I only, I meant to hurt Gibb's feelings, but I only
00:12:23 meant to hurt Gibb's feelings.
00:12:24 If you're trans and like you, you were offended by that, like fuck you, like you don't get
00:12:29 to be offended because I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
00:12:31 I only meant to hurt Gibb's feelings.
00:12:33 So, you know, just lying about it on Twitter.
00:12:35 So basically she posts this, this podcast appearance on Twitter.
00:12:39 Everybody dog piles her ratioed completely.
00:12:44 Gibb says like fuck you on Twitter and gets like 10 times the, the like ratio on her fuck
00:12:49 you reply.
00:12:52 It's a big, it's a big shit show.
00:12:54 So this, then this, this past week we recorded immediately I call an immediate emergency
00:13:00 bonus episode where we do the live, live, like line by line, listen and respond thing
00:13:10 with Simsie.
00:13:11 And we recorded that and we released it right away.
00:13:12 It's up on the, the Patreon right now.
00:13:15 So that was a very funny thing that happened this week.
00:13:18 And that is what sparked a bunch of arguments on Twitter, including the one between you
00:13:23 and Riley.
00:13:24 So that's, that's the background for why Riley and you were having a, a big, oh, because
00:13:30 you, right, because you went on Twitter and you said like, yeah, Trixie is no longer invited
00:13:34 on the, on the, on Treaded, which is very funny.
00:13:37 Very, very funny.
00:13:38 And Riley was very upset.
00:13:40 This really ruffled Riley's feathers because if there's one thing, you know, his, his pride
00:13:43 as a, as a producer does not allow for any of his connections to like fall through upon
00:13:48 each other.
00:13:50 This is, this is, this is a big, a giant, a massive blow to his personal brand.
00:13:54 So for context, there, there is some deep lore here.
00:13:58 Okay.
00:14:00 A few months ago, or actually almost a year ago now, we were approached by somebody with
00:14:06 a me, Barry Coffey company.
00:14:09 And they apparently had, they apparently had already sponsored Riley and YGG on some extent.
00:14:17 I don't know exactly, but they mentioned that, uh, I, yeah, I, um, I just, I just want to
00:14:25 say, I, I, uh, yeah, what could, I, how can I be delicate?
00:14:31 Um, I'm sure that, I'm sure that they said they did that.
00:14:37 Well, okay.
00:14:38 I was going to say that they said that, well, because I asked, you know, if you're sponsoring
00:14:42 them, have they ever heard of our show?
00:14:43 And they said, actually, you guys were one of the ones they suggested I reach out to.
00:14:48 So, okay.
00:14:51 So I was like, oh really?
00:14:53 They were like, yeah, um, uh, I guess you're actually the guys from Shreddit.
00:15:00 Um, cause originally I'd been told by Vale to reach out to them.
00:15:03 They were like, I'm surprised you guys reached out to me because I was going to reach out to you.
00:15:09 Um, that's very, that's very strange, actually.
00:15:12 That's very curious, but share.
00:15:16 Uh, so going by that, we've always kind of joked that, uh, you know, they, if they
00:15:22 suggested, uh, that person reach out to us and they must watch our show.
00:15:28 And so it was a funny meme, like, oh, you know what, Trixie's being a bitch on Twitter.
00:15:33 So, and on this, uh, on this guest appearance.
00:15:36 So, you know what I'm going to do?
00:15:37 I'm going to post on Twitter telling her she's never allowed on Shreddit.
00:15:42 Hmm.
00:15:43 It's, and I really liked it.
00:15:46 The funny, the funny thing about the fact that Riley, like, got really mad and
00:15:52 started, like, complaining at you about it is like, it literally, it had nothing to do with him.
00:15:59 Yeah.
00:15:59 He, he, like, he was not involved at all, but he just had to be like an insult, like
00:16:07 any, an insult against Trixie is, is an insult against him in his mind for some
00:16:12 reason that I genuinely do not understand.
00:16:15 Um, I mean, dear God, it's so weird because he kept, you
00:16:22 know, trying to make it some kind of movement, like every other tweet saying
00:16:25 something like, you guys are all SJWs.
00:16:28 You're trying to censor free speech.
00:16:30 This is a movement.
00:16:32 And he kept going on and on about it.
00:16:34 And so I quote, he kept comparing it to like, like you guys also want to cancel
00:16:38 black comedians.
00:16:40 Yeah, like he kept, that's what you also want to do.
00:16:42 And it's the same thing.
00:16:43 When you say that Trixie making fun of a trans woman's voice and claiming it
00:16:47 doesn't pass and laughing at it is transphobic.
00:16:50 What you're basically doing is saying that like black comedians like Dave
00:16:53 Chappelle shouldn't be allowed to have to be, to work in this town ever again.
00:16:58 Yeah, I mean, what is that comparison?
00:17:01 I don't know.
00:17:01 It's fucking stupid.
00:17:03 That's the biggest leave I've ever heard.
00:17:05 Like, I know what he means, but it's fucking dumb.
00:17:09 And it's, it's dumb.
00:17:10 I think in specific context, that argument can be like good.
00:17:14 But the context of, hey, this, I mean, I'm going to be a little
00:17:18 transphobic and say that this trans person doesn't sound like a woman.
00:17:22 Yeah.
00:17:23 Is, and then when you get called out for it, well, actually you're racist.
00:17:27 So, I mean, it's, it's basic.
00:17:29 I mean, yeah, like it's the fact that he, the fact that he's bringing it.
00:17:34 Like nobody, nobody mentioned that.
00:17:35 Nobody was talking about that.
00:17:37 It's basically a completely separate issue, but he brings it up as like,
00:17:40 you are also responsible for this other thing.
00:17:43 Yeah, it's like his trap card.
00:17:44 No, you found their trap card.
00:17:46 So, so what I ended up doing is I quote, tweeted him saying that it was
00:17:51 a big free speech movement with a screenshot from one punch man where
00:17:55 Satama says, here's a guy with free time and he's holding a letter.
00:17:59 Classic reaction, classic reaction.
00:18:01 And I was like, you know, no one's ever brought up a movement or free speech.
00:18:06 We're a show that makes fun of Reddit.
00:18:08 Trying to make us political with something is a very Reddit thing to do.
00:18:13 Right.
00:18:14 And then after that, he just deleted a lot of the political tweets.
00:18:19 His, yeah, his political takes in that thread were very cringe.
00:18:22 I will say, I will say this.
00:18:25 He seemed very caught up.
00:18:27 He seemed very caught up with the idea that it is like insane, like insane
00:18:34 in his mind to suggest that a trans person could ever be transphobic.
00:18:39 Like the very, the very idea of that like completely defeats itself in his mind.
00:18:44 It's a total contradiction.
00:18:46 Say, you know, same.
00:18:50 I mean, I don't do I have to explain how like that's fucking stupid.
00:18:54 I mean, like, of course, anyone can be anything no matter what, you know,
00:19:02 follow your dreams.
00:19:03 If you want to be a big anyone can do yeah, you can do it.
00:19:09 Hey, if I can do it, anyone can.
00:19:12 You want to make fun of trans people, go for it.
00:19:16 That's going to get me canceled.
00:19:17 Oh, yeah, you're out.
00:19:18 Please, not again.
00:19:22 Yeah.
00:19:23 So that was the that was that story.
00:19:26 That was the big funny drama that happened on Twitter this week.
00:19:31 Stay, stay tuned for more.
00:19:34 We're just just just really funny seeing her post that and just get completely
00:19:39 ratio on Twitter literally just made us money because we turned it into a bonus
00:19:45 episode and a bunch of people pledged.
00:19:47 If you if you pledge to hear that our response to that, thank you very much.
00:19:51 And I hope you enjoyed it was a fun.
00:19:54 It was a fun to record that I went into I went into it.
00:19:58 I deliberately avoided listening to it so that I would not have heard it when we
00:20:02 did the bonus episodes, why but have a fresh reaction.
00:20:05 I'd be hearing everything for the very first time.
00:20:07 I was I was pretty pretty baffled by some of like the weird like the weird
00:20:14 stretches and the weird like she knows this isn't true, but she's saying it
00:20:18 anyway, because she knows these podcast hosts don't know us and she can get away
00:20:22 with like pretending that she thinks it's true about us.
00:20:25 Like set like saying like saying that like I would that like I would like
00:20:30 freeze up and like not be able to function if someone like approached
00:20:34 me in public and talk to me as you know, like that's that's yep.
00:20:40 That's me, I guess.
00:20:42 Anyway, good, good, good times.
00:20:44 Yeah, good times this week.
00:20:46 Great times.
00:20:46 Yeah.
00:20:48 So OK, OK, OK.
00:20:50 The reason why we're on.
00:20:53 Have you seen the Antunes video?
00:20:56 Oh, no, I didn't.
00:20:57 You posted for me.
00:20:58 I didn't get around to watching it.
00:21:00 OK, I do know who Antunes is.
00:21:02 All right, that's that is a perfect jumping off point, though, like knowing who he is.
00:21:08 Let me I talked to a few about the syndiems, but you don't have any
00:21:13 memories about someone named Daft Pina being in the PCP fan community, right?
00:21:19 No, no, I I may have heard the name Daft Pina around somewhere,
00:21:25 but I know that I know I think the first time I heard of him was when you had
00:21:30 some falling out with him or something like that.
00:21:33 That's why.
00:21:33 So the reason why they bring that up, there was a old tweet that I found
00:21:40 it's deleted now, but it was him posting a picture of an airport and saying
00:21:44 I wish I was landing for Radcon and I don't remember who we tagged.
00:21:48 But I know we tagged like two or three members of the PCP in it.
00:21:52 Mm hmm.
00:21:53 And wait, wait, wait, what was the tweet that he tagged some of us in?
00:21:58 He said he took a picture of an airport and he said I was I wish I was landing for Radcon.
00:22:05 You know, like you want to know this.
00:22:07 I think it was multiple years ago, like it wasn't a recent tweet.
00:22:13 OK, so so so Daft Pina is familiar with Radcon.
00:22:18 That's pretty funny.
00:22:19 Um, it's also funny that he used to be a fan of old school PCP back when it was a lot edgier.
00:22:27 Yeah, yeah.
00:22:30 Oh, man, do you think he's a do you think he's a Yig head?
00:22:33 Oh, I hope not.
00:22:35 There's no there's no way.
00:22:37 There's like there's no way there's like there's like six.
00:22:40 There's like six real Yig heads and they're all like and they're all like very
00:22:46 like obviously insane and mentally ill on Twitter.
00:22:51 Lamal, that's right for you, but to tell to tell what's going on here.
00:22:57 I got into a little squabble with Mr.
00:23:00 Penis. I'm sorry, Mr. Pina.
00:23:03 I'm sorry, Mr. Pina.
00:23:05 Gotcha. OK.
00:23:07 So basically, he made a video on a theory on art.
00:23:11 And at the time, I thought the video did a good job.
00:23:14 Can you explain who a theory on art is?
00:23:16 A theory on art is a very big Twitter artist.
00:23:19 He is very good art. OK.
00:23:22 He has been on my show, Shreddit, three times, not since the video, of course.
00:23:28 But, you know, at the time there came out of video canceling them for saying,
00:23:32 you know, racial slurs and the F slur and all this.
00:23:38 OK. At the time, I thought, you know, the video was good.
00:23:42 It canceled a bigot.
00:23:43 Um, OK.
00:23:45 But the issue is he used clips from Shreddit three times in a show,
00:23:48 which is fine credit them, right?
00:23:50 Well, the first two, he cut off our names so you couldn't see whose videos it was.
00:23:56 And then and then the third time he called us the r slash podcast.
00:24:02 And that's funny because that's not a very popular podcast.
00:24:06 That feels more like a jab than a credit
00:24:09 because the r slash podcast is just a text to speech robot reading reddit post.
00:24:15 Hmm. Well, why would he do that?
00:24:19 I don't know.
00:24:20 I politely asked in a server and he says,
00:24:25 well, in the third time I show, you know, a clip from your show,
00:24:29 the name is in the bottom.
00:24:30 I don't care that I miscredited it.
00:24:33 I just, you know, if people really want to find you, they can.
00:24:37 OK.
00:24:38 And it's like, well, OK, so I understand what you're saying,
00:24:43 but you've made several videos calling out artists for tracing
00:24:46 and, you know, not crediting their work.
00:24:50 OK. OK.
00:24:51 So you feel you feel you were improperly credited.
00:24:53 Well, I mean, we got called the wrong name.
00:24:56 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:24:58 And I mean, yeah, it sounds like he just he sounds like he just fucked up
00:25:02 and then wouldn't admit it.
00:25:03 Yeah, especially for like a 200 sub channel, you know, show or whatever.
00:25:08 Having someone because he has over 100,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel
00:25:13 and the theory on video got over well over the like amount of
00:25:19 like subscribers he has.
00:25:21 It has like 200,000 now.
00:25:23 And there's like a bunch of videos about a theory on, et cetera.
00:25:26 And having like that, like if he went, by the way,
00:25:31 like if you at least just put in the description,
00:25:34 it would just help at least like a little bit gain a bigger audience.
00:25:39 You know? Yeah. Yeah.
00:25:40 I mean, of course.
00:25:41 No, I think I think there's merit to what you're saying.
00:25:46 He gets worse, though.
00:25:48 Yeah.
00:25:49 So a history of like not not crediting
00:25:54 anyone in his videos.
00:25:57 The most he does is credit the the people that
00:26:01 like voice at like, you know, retweets or whatever at the end of the video.
00:26:05 He like does that, but he doesn't credit any of his sources.
00:26:08 He doesn't like give like full context
00:26:11 interviews to like whenever he interviews someone.
00:26:14 So it's purely just his word against, you know,
00:26:18 it's just his word against the viewers, you know,
00:26:21 it's his word against everyone else's and he goes off like,
00:26:26 you know, his his fans believing whatever it is.
00:26:30 Yeah. I mean, sure.
00:26:32 I don't make sense.
00:26:32 But like I was saying, so, you know, I was very polite.
00:26:35 I was very professional.
00:26:37 I was like, listen, you know, you call artists out for this.
00:26:40 I understand that, you know, you might be busy.
00:26:43 But if you could just, you know, please credit me, right?
00:26:47 And then I get a ban warning from his discord server for that.
00:26:51 Like super nice, super professional.
00:26:53 Um, OK, so then I start talking
00:26:57 because people in a server start reaching out to me.
00:26:59 I start talking with them.
00:27:02 And did I get another warning?
00:27:05 And the second warning reads like a schizo
00:27:07 post and it's full of misspellings.
00:27:12 From from who?
00:27:13 From Pina.
00:27:15 Because he has a he types out messages for a bot to DM people.
00:27:21 And the reason why I know he typed this out
00:27:23 is there are multiple misspellings.
00:27:26 He types out messages for a bot to DM people.
00:27:29 Like, like whenever you do something,
00:27:33 you can get a message in your DMs.
00:27:36 Oh, yeah, you broke rule number one, two, et cetera.
00:27:40 And then it gets like a very vague reasoning.
00:27:43 Gotcha, gotcha.
00:27:46 All right.
00:27:49 OK, and here I'm pulling it up.
00:27:52 OK, yeah.
00:27:54 And the second the first warning
00:27:58 was for asking him a second time in VC, you know,
00:28:01 just trying to have a back and forth conversation about,
00:28:04 hey, you know, it's really not cool of you specifically
00:28:07 to not credit people.
00:28:09 Um, but the second warning was you were warned
00:28:12 in armchair critics for you were warned
00:28:14 because you were persistently in violation of the rules.
00:28:16 You were not threatened with a ban.
00:28:17 Past being warned, you continued to instigate arguments
00:28:20 and use mistrust and attempt to rally members of this server.
00:28:24 And he spelled this wrong.
00:28:26 The feature creator, Daft, address your question in Q&A
00:28:28 and past his response, you have continued to instigate
00:28:31 and falsify the situation.
00:28:33 How is asking to be credited at instigating
00:28:35 and falsifying a situation like it's not complicated?
00:28:39 It sounds like he's just mad.
00:28:40 It sounds like he's just mad.
00:28:43 It's just big mad.
00:28:45 As you stated before, you were simply asking Daft
00:28:47 to credit you, yet you are now claiming Daft
00:28:50 with stealing assets and refusing to credit.
00:28:52 Well, he did play.
00:28:53 I mean, those are the same thing.
00:28:54 Those are the same thing.
00:28:55 Yes, and he did straight up refuse to credit me.
00:28:58 Like...
00:28:59 Yeah.
00:29:01 Yeah, get your story straight.
00:29:03 You say he refused, he took your content without crediting,
00:29:07 but now you're saying that he took your content
00:29:09 without crediting?
00:29:10 Oh, no.
00:29:11 Okay, I see.
00:29:12 And the funny part was before I got this,
00:29:15 I have an app called Better Discord.
00:29:17 I can see hidden voice channels that the public can not.
00:29:20 I can't see into locked text chats,
00:29:22 but I can see who's in calls
00:29:24 and what the chat rooms are called.
00:29:26 Okay.
00:29:27 He had, at the time, a PR manager.
00:29:32 Him and that PR manager were in call for four hours
00:29:35 before I got the second warning,
00:29:36 and then the second I got it, they both left call.
00:29:40 I have confirmed with the old PR agent
00:29:46 that the entire four hours was discussing
00:29:48 how to handle this.
00:29:50 Why does it take four hours to discuss
00:29:53 if you should credit somebody or not?
00:29:55 I see.
00:29:57 To give context, it's not like 100% certain
00:30:00 that it was the PR manager.
00:30:02 It was, well, no, no, it was the head moderator,
00:30:07 but they claimed that the PR manager bit was just a joke,
00:30:12 but also, who knows?
00:30:14 Yeah.
00:30:15 Okay.
00:30:16 Either one works.
00:30:18 All right, so, so.
00:30:20 It's still not good.
00:30:21 All right, so it sounds like a weird stupid shit fit
00:30:24 and he threw a tantrum and gave you some weird
00:30:29 fucking bullshit about some legalese nonsense
00:30:33 because you wanted to be credited,
00:30:34 and he was like, well, actually,
00:30:35 here's why I shouldn't have to do that and fuck you.
00:30:38 Whatever, he flipped out about the fucking stupid shit
00:30:42 that he should just say sorry for and fix.
00:30:46 That was it for my end.
00:30:48 I mean, I made a tweet on Twitter
00:30:49 because I thought it was really messed up.
00:30:52 Yeah.
00:30:54 The reason why I said I used to agree with his video
00:30:56 on Ethereum is Ethereum actually,
00:31:00 he came out as a black gay man,
00:31:01 and he says that he has the right to use those slurs,
00:31:04 how he sees fit.
00:31:06 Wait, wait, wait.
00:31:06 Ethereum did?
00:31:07 Yes, Ethereum is.
00:31:08 Oh, that's right, that's right.
00:31:10 Oh, that was the guy who was like.
00:31:12 Yeah.
00:31:12 Yes, I'm black and gay, so it's okay.
00:31:14 And he said that, and nobody knew that before.
00:31:16 Was he lying about that?
00:31:18 No, no, everyone was like,
00:31:21 he said, by the way, I'm gay and black, Lil.
00:31:24 And everyone was like, cap, cap, you can't be black, cap.
00:31:28 Yeah, Defpina posted the meme of why would someone
00:31:31 go on the internet and just tell lies.
00:31:34 Yeah.
00:31:35 And then Ethereum posted a video of himself.
00:31:38 Being black and having sex with another man.
00:31:41 Well, anyone that's known,
00:31:44 anyone that's known Aether for a very long time knows
00:31:46 that if you bring up feminine men in the call,
00:31:48 he will go off on rants about how much he loves feminine men.
00:31:55 The homosexual part was never in doubt,
00:31:58 but nobody knew that he was black.
00:32:00 Yeah, okay.
00:32:01 He's posted like a lot of videos of him
00:32:03 like going through his old notebooks and stuff,
00:32:06 like where you could just see his hand flipping through pages,
00:32:09 unless he just has like an incredible budget for like,
00:32:13 faking truths, I'm pretty sure he's black.
00:32:16 Jesus.
00:32:17 Okay, all right, understood, understood.
00:32:20 Yeah.
00:32:21 So, okay, I think I understand all of this crap that happens.
00:32:28 So where does it stand now?
00:32:31 Did Defpina eventually just like say fuck you,
00:32:33 get out of my server and that's it?
00:32:36 He actually did because, okay,
00:32:39 so behind the scenes for the last month,
00:32:42 there have been a lot of people collaborating
00:32:44 on anti-pina projects, let's say.
00:32:49 Advil here is one of the ones-
00:32:51 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
00:32:52 Defpina, I want to say, okay,
00:32:55 the one thing I did see of Defpina was,
00:32:58 you remember Cheezy's big Twitter artist
00:33:01 who follows you tweets about,
00:33:06 you know, those comics about like,
00:33:09 when big Twitter artists like your tweet
00:33:12 don't give you the retweet boost, right?
00:33:14 Yeah.
00:33:15 Yeah, I remember-
00:33:16 Oh, he's had a fuck going, actually.
00:33:17 Defpina was one of the guys,
00:33:20 was one of the big people on Twitter who replied,
00:33:23 this is, actually, nobody owes you a retweet
00:33:25 and you just look petty
00:33:27 and it's just going to ruin your reputation
00:33:29 if you just complain about people not retweeting you.
00:33:32 And it was one of those,
00:33:34 it was one of the loser responses from someone who is big
00:33:39 being like, I hate when people,
00:33:41 I hate when people want anything from me.
00:33:44 I hate when smaller content want a boost.
00:33:47 Just get better at all.
00:33:48 There were many cringe responses to that,
00:33:51 but that particular one of being a big artist
00:33:53 and being like, you shouldn't expect anything from me,
00:33:56 peasants, was like one of the more cringe ones
00:33:58 and he did it, so that did not leave a good impression
00:34:02 in my eyes.
00:34:04 So, okay, that's my context.
00:34:10 Continue.
00:34:11 So, yeah, a lot of people reached out.
00:34:13 Antunes is one of them.
00:34:14 Antunes had a lot of personal beef with Daft.
00:34:18 Oh, well, Antunes is much worse.
00:34:22 Yeah, I mean, yeah.
00:34:24 So, a lot of their beef response comes down to
00:34:29 pettiness, like Daft refusing to give him the recording
00:34:34 he made of Antunes in their interview
00:34:37 and just a bunch of stuff like that
00:34:40 because he was interviewed for the video,
00:34:41 he did know about it, but it's the way Daft handled it.
00:34:45 For which video?
00:34:46 For the Antunes video?
00:34:47 Yeah, he made a video on Antunes.
00:34:49 Okay.
00:34:50 And he recorded-
00:34:51 I mean, fuck it, fuck Antunes.
00:34:54 Nothing, no treatment is too bad for Antunes.
00:34:59 Regardless of how you think of Antunes,
00:35:01 I still think his handling of the whole situation
00:35:05 was not the best because he-
00:35:08 Doubt.
00:35:09 He doubted.
00:35:09 No, no, no, no, no, no.
00:35:10 There's nothing you could do to Antunes
00:35:12 that I'd be like, ooh, he didn't deserve that.
00:35:14 Not on like an Antunes personal level,
00:35:16 like I don't care how you feel about any of the people
00:35:20 I'm making my video with or like on or whatever,
00:35:23 but going like-
00:35:24 Are you making videos?
00:35:25 Are you working with Antunes?
00:35:27 I asked him for an interview and that was really it.
00:35:30 I asked him for information.
00:35:30 Okay, okay, I mean, that's one thing.
00:35:34 But like, is it technically working with?
00:35:37 I can never say that.
00:35:39 Okay.
00:35:39 No, interviewing someone is not working.
00:35:41 No, it's not unless you're like both making money off of it.
00:35:44 Okay, then yeah, I'm not gonna make money off the shit,
00:35:46 but the, I feel like from like a general creator sense,
00:35:51 I don't know if I just have like this self-righteous
00:35:54 like belief on how a commentary YouTuber should handle it,
00:35:58 but it seems like even though Daft tries to stir away
00:36:01 from the commentary spectrum,
00:36:03 even though he's collabed with the right opinion
00:36:05 and Turkey Tom, the way he handles himself,
00:36:09 like online and on his own channel,
00:36:11 even is very unbecoming of a commentary YouTuber.
00:36:16 He's very sensitive.
00:36:17 He doesn't work.
00:36:19 He's very, he's besmirching the good name
00:36:23 of commentary YouTubers across the board.
00:36:27 He is tarnishing.
00:36:28 We have standards, dammit.
00:36:30 Well, I feel like there should be.
00:36:32 I feel like a lot of times commentary channels
00:36:35 just like, they're just so fucking stupid sometimes.
00:36:39 Of course.
00:36:41 I don't wanna be like the police of YouTube
00:36:43 because that's cringe as shit.
00:36:45 But like, I feel like it should be more like journalism
00:36:50 instead of like just talking shit about someone
00:36:52 and ruining like their reputation
00:36:54 without any actual evidence
00:36:55 or even like giving them a chance to defend themselves
00:36:59 or giving them a fair like trial, you know?
00:37:03 That's how I feel about commentary.
00:37:05 I think, ah.
00:37:07 I'd rather talk like, like if I'm gonna make a video.
00:37:10 I don't know if I entirely agree with you.
00:37:13 I don't know if I entirely disagree with you either.
00:37:15 I mean.
00:37:16 At least the way I wanna make my commentary videos
00:37:18 is I wanna find a topic that is either like unknown
00:37:22 and see how truly deplorable it is
00:37:24 and talk to as many people as the other side
00:37:27 and on the side that's like talking shit about them
00:37:30 and see what the truth is
00:37:32 because both sides gonna fucking like,
00:37:35 like, you know, be completely unfair to the other side,
00:37:38 you know?
00:37:39 And, and-
00:37:40 Yeah, sure.
00:37:41 And what people like Daph will do,
00:37:43 they'll like talk to one person on the other side
00:37:46 and completely cut out any context that they had
00:37:49 to make it a fair, you know, video or a fair anything.
00:37:53 And he doesn't even like cite his sources for why,
00:37:56 like, he won't even like put, he has a second channel
00:38:00 and he won't even put like a full interview on there,
00:38:03 which is something that like, like a technicals does.
00:38:06 Like, I feel like that is a very good,
00:38:08 like just like a safe thing to do.
00:38:11 And he doesn't even do the most bare bones commentary thing
00:38:13 is, do you watch commentary at all?
00:38:17 What?
00:38:18 Do you watch like commentary videos at all?
00:38:20 Uh, I mean, I give me, what's an example?
00:38:25 Like Turkey Tom, Leafy, those types of people.
00:38:29 I have probably seen a few,
00:38:31 but I don't like regularly watch them or anything.
00:38:34 So the most bare bones thing you can do
00:38:35 is just put a disclaimer at the beginning,
00:38:37 which is, hey, don't harass these people.
00:38:40 This is just either my opinion
00:38:41 or I'm just giving you like the facts,
00:38:43 but don't harass these people.
00:38:44 He's never done that in a single video,
00:38:47 not in a single tweet.
00:38:48 He hasn't said that like in his YouTube description.
00:38:52 So it's very just like unspoked, you know?
00:38:58 You think, okay.
00:38:59 You think that Daph Pina,
00:39:02 you think that his conduct is unbecoming.
00:39:05 Yes, exactly.
00:39:07 Of the honorable title of commentary YouTuber.
00:39:10 Yeah, it's a nightly manner of being a commentator.
00:39:12 I kind of get what you're saying.
00:39:14 I get what you're saying.
00:39:15 I get what you're saying.
00:39:15 I guess because I grew up on commentary,
00:39:17 I just have like this nice image of it,
00:39:19 because I know it is pretty dog shit to be honest.
00:39:21 Like I know like it is probably the most cancer part
00:39:24 of the entire internet, but I just-
00:39:27 I don't know about that.
00:39:28 Oh yeah, true.
00:39:29 But like I just want it to be like,
00:39:31 I want it to be as fair as it can be to, you know.
00:39:37 That's, okay, yeah.
00:39:39 I mean, fairness is good.
00:39:41 Fairness is good.
00:39:42 And I understand what you're saying.
00:39:43 I mean, yeah, if you've got two sides of a story,
00:39:47 yeah, both sides of any story
00:39:49 always claim something different.
00:39:51 And so like the best way to do it is to get both
00:39:54 and then try and figure out like who is lying about what,
00:39:58 who is being honest about what,
00:40:00 what is the real story?
00:40:01 Because it's usually somewhere in the middle.
00:40:05 Yeah, yeah.
00:40:06 And like generally the more people you ask about something,
00:40:08 usually you can kind of suss out the truth
00:40:11 if you get enough different people to explain it to you
00:40:14 and you kind of like pick out the commonalities.
00:40:17 So I, I have, yeah, that's, that's good.
00:40:21 I get you, I get you.
00:40:23 You don't, and you don't think Daft does that.
00:40:25 The most he does is allow, so I grew up, or not grew up,
00:40:30 but I used to watch a lot of Daft Pina
00:40:31 while I was trying to figure out my style.
00:40:33 And I was like, yeah, this guy's,
00:40:35 this guy's pretty cool.
00:40:35 Cause I never seen like a lot of commentary YouTubers
00:40:40 like give interviews to, you know, people.
00:40:44 And he was like the first guy, I saw that I would do that.
00:40:49 But then, and then I started to research it a little bit more
00:40:52 and he didn't like include the full context.
00:40:56 So he would just like cut out context.
00:40:59 He would like change it to fit a narrative,
00:41:03 which is fine, I guess, but like if you're,
00:41:06 if you're going through all the trouble of create,
00:41:08 like going to have a interview with someone
00:41:11 and going to cut context,
00:41:13 at least use the entire interview on something.
00:41:15 Cause no one's going to like check the original interview.
00:41:18 Okay. Yeah.
00:41:21 I feel you.
00:41:22 Yeah, I feel you.
00:41:24 If I felt like someone was like deliberately leaving stuff out,
00:41:28 as they're trying to explain something to me,
00:41:30 I'd be like, well, well, fuck you.
00:41:33 Yeah. Yeah, okay.
00:41:35 But I mean, I was saying before a lot of people
00:41:38 reached out to me and shredded in general
00:41:42 to ask us about what happened there.
00:41:45 Multiple people wanted the story.
00:41:47 Antunes included because Antunes was a,
00:41:51 Antunes has a personal grudge with Pina.
00:41:55 I'm sure, I'm sure he does.
00:41:57 I'm sure he does.
00:41:58 But Pina has made a very large amount of enemies
00:42:01 and I didn't know that cause I knew nothing about Pina
00:42:04 prior to this.
00:42:04 To me, it was just some guy who stole my content.
00:42:08 Now I have a lot of people reaching out to me
00:42:09 because apparently he tends to step on a lot of people's
00:42:12 toes.
00:42:14 Sure.
00:42:15 Like a good example recently is his fight with Tina Fey
00:42:22 on Twitter, who was an artist that was pretending
00:42:24 to be female.
00:42:28 Oh yeah, okay.
00:42:30 Not Tina Fey of Saturday Night Live.
00:42:33 Yeah.
00:42:33 No, no, not that Tina Fey.
00:42:35 Okay.
00:42:36 That would be funny.
00:42:38 But so he was basically saying,
00:42:41 I know you're a dude.
00:42:42 I have your Facebook.
00:42:43 I sent you a friend request.
00:42:45 And then he said later, I had people email me
00:42:50 your information.
00:42:52 So he has people that email him the docs
00:42:55 of people he has beef with.
00:42:57 Well, what happened is he,
00:43:00 so he tweeted out that he's working on a video
00:43:05 on Tina Fey, right?
00:43:09 And what happened is he included an email
00:43:12 that was like, if you know any information
00:43:14 about this person, please let me know.
00:43:17 And so people were emailing him and some,
00:43:21 like a group of people, I guess,
00:43:22 were emailing Tina Fey's docs,
00:43:25 like their name, their face, all that stuff, right?
00:43:28 Yeah, but he didn't condone that.
00:43:31 I mean, he didn't condone that, he condoned it.
00:43:34 Instead of being like, what the fuck?
00:43:35 Why would you give me this?
00:43:36 This video isn't about their docs.
00:43:38 He was like, really, send me more.
00:43:41 I need to know who this person is.
00:43:44 Okay.
00:43:45 It was just a very uncomfortable situation.
00:43:47 And he made it worse by tweeting at Tina Fey,
00:43:50 like in an unhinged rant, or not even a rant,
00:43:53 just tweeting at them, like unhinged being like,
00:43:56 hey, I've gotten private information.
00:43:58 Tina was kind of like taunting him and being like,
00:44:01 you're cutting out context.
00:44:03 We should get a call, bro, and we can discuss this.
00:44:05 And Daft tweeted it, and was like,
00:44:09 yeah, I found your personal information.
00:44:12 I hacked your Google accounts.
00:44:14 Let's talk, bro.
00:44:15 Follow me on Twitter at my Discord.
00:44:18 That reminds me of someone.
00:44:20 Did somebody else do that?
00:44:22 Did somebody else, was that like,
00:44:24 maybe someone in the big, like,
00:44:25 monkey drama from a few years ago,
00:44:27 be like, I have your personal information
00:44:31 as like a bargaining chip?
00:44:34 Damn, I remember someone in some big drama
00:44:37 I was following doing some similar shit.
00:44:41 Der.
00:44:42 Probably Keemstar.
00:44:43 Well, it probably happens all the time.
00:44:47 Probably Keemstar, to be honest.
00:44:50 You know what?
00:44:51 Yeah, oh wait, I might be actually
00:44:53 drinking a Keemstar in the Wings of Redemption story.
00:44:56 Oh, it was Wings of Redemption.
00:44:57 Okay, so just Destiny.
00:44:58 Do you know who just Destiny is?
00:45:00 No.
00:45:01 Completely sidetracked,
00:45:02 but he's a commentary YouTuber who got called out
00:45:05 by like this like 13 year old.
00:45:07 He threatened to sue him,
00:45:09 and then Keemstar found his docs
00:45:13 and was about to like docs him,
00:45:15 even though it wasn't him.
00:45:16 I think I am thinking of Keemstar, actually.
00:45:17 Yeah, it wasn't him at all,
00:45:19 but he was like, I found this guy's docs.
00:45:21 Let's chat, bro.
00:45:25 Gotcha, okay.
00:45:27 Imagine.
00:45:28 Well, so all right,
00:45:29 I understand what you're saying about Daft Pina.
00:45:31 So what are you gonna do about it?
00:45:34 Well, Advil here also reached out.
00:45:36 He is making a video,
00:45:38 and a lot of the people involved
00:45:40 are going to push that video.
00:45:42 I hope so.
00:45:43 So you're making a Daft Pina exposed, basically.
00:45:47 Yeah, and I'm trying to keep it up
00:45:49 to the commentary standard, you know?
00:45:52 You have exacting ethical standards.
00:45:56 I have CSGO gameplay, vaporwave intros.
00:46:02 This is everything, the commentary video.
00:46:05 This is how to make a correct commentary video.
00:46:08 Okay.
00:46:09 I start off like, hey, what's up, guys?
00:46:10 Welcome back to another commentary roast.
00:46:14 Pretty much everything you need.
00:46:15 Yeah, well, one of the reasons why,
00:46:18 one of the reasons why I agreed to talk to Advil,
00:46:21 and I signed on for this as well.
00:46:22 That's cool.
00:46:24 Uh, no.
00:46:26 Okay.
00:46:28 Well, no, he does seem to have actual ethical standards.
00:46:31 But also, it's, you know, I looked it up,
00:46:34 and there's no video that really
00:46:37 puts all the pieces of the Daft Pina pie together.
00:46:40 You know, like his beef with Jaden animations
00:46:43 and Odd Ones Out, no one mentions that.
00:46:46 You know, there's no actual exposed video on the guide,
00:46:49 despite him doxing people
00:46:51 and just doing a lot of shady shit.
00:46:53 Like, do you know what he did to Jaden animations?
00:46:56 Uh, I don't.
00:46:58 He said, has a fan, you're at,
00:47:00 and I'm watching this video,
00:47:02 you're faking your mental illness.
00:47:05 Hmm.
00:47:06 What happened is she made this video
00:47:08 about her experience with Interrexia,
00:47:10 called Why She Doesn't Have a Face Reveal.
00:47:12 And it was like, it was just her telling her,
00:47:15 like experience through Interrexia,
00:47:16 but she was using her video and like, you know,
00:47:19 sounds and all that stuff, too,
00:47:20 to make the audience, like, understand her point.
00:47:24 And it was like an old video.
00:47:25 He's already, like, semi-apologized for this,
00:47:28 which I don't have, like, I'm glad that he apologized,
00:47:30 but he was just like, he was like,
00:47:33 why would you need to pad out the video this much?
00:47:37 Honestly, it seems like you are fishing for content,
00:47:40 and Daft Pina talks like, like he's a bit slow.
00:47:45 So he goes like.
00:47:46 Okay.
00:47:47 So he was like, you're padding out the video,
00:47:50 you're probably bipolar, schizophrenic,
00:47:52 like all that stuff, and he was just like, calling her,
00:47:55 all this like shitty stuff.
00:47:57 He called her, he said she did have,
00:47:59 like other mental illnesses?
00:48:00 Yeah, but not, but probably not Interrexia.
00:48:03 You're faking this one.
00:48:04 Yeah.
00:48:05 You probably have different ones.
00:48:05 Yeah, because you're fucking insane.
00:48:07 That's what he said.
00:48:08 Okay.
00:48:09 And then a couple months later,
00:48:11 he made a video about her music video with Boy in a Band,
00:48:14 about her bulimia, right?
00:48:17 And he basically did the same thing.
00:48:19 He said that because she didn't donate to the charity,
00:48:24 like a bulimia charity,
00:48:26 that she's just been profiting off like bulimia
00:48:31 without like giving back to the community or whatever.
00:48:34 First of all, fucked.
00:48:35 Okay.
00:48:36 Second off.
00:48:36 Okay, I get it.
00:48:37 Yeah, and then he apologized for the first video,
00:48:40 but still kept the second one.
00:48:42 And he's still profiting off the second one,
00:48:45 even though he did the exact same thing.
00:48:47 Yeah, sounds, I mean, I don't want to,
00:48:51 I don't want to stick my neck out too far
00:48:53 for Jayden animations.
00:48:54 I don't really care if someone goes after Jayden anime,
00:48:57 but it sounds like he's,
00:48:58 I mean, it sounds like he was being a bit of a shitter
00:49:00 in this situation.
00:49:02 Yeah.
00:49:03 And so, yeah.
00:49:05 All right.
00:49:06 That sounds like a bit shit.
00:49:07 Yeah.
00:49:08 He probably should have apologized for some of that.
00:49:12 Okay.
00:49:16 So what were we talking about?
00:49:17 Oh, I was talking about how Pina has made a lot of enemies.
00:49:22 He's done a lot of shitty things.
00:49:23 There are a lot of people co-signing on this video
00:49:26 to be made in the first place
00:49:27 because it's a common consensus.
00:49:30 You're in the process of talking to people.
00:49:33 If you talk to Antunes again,
00:49:35 tell him that I, Ben Saint, say, fuck you.
00:49:39 Shut the fuck up, you fucking mutant.
00:49:44 Tell him he's a sub-human mutant for me.
00:49:47 I'll let him know.
00:49:49 Actually, put that in,
00:49:50 okay, when you make the video
00:49:53 and you have Antunes in it,
00:49:55 make sure to include an addendum of me, Ben Saint,
00:49:58 saying, hey, by the way,
00:49:59 the person you just listened to is a fucking idiot
00:50:01 and you shouldn't believe anything they say.
00:50:03 They're big liar, big racist,
00:50:06 big, big fucking jackass and fuck him.
00:50:10 And that gets the PCP seal of approval.
00:50:13 There you go, Advil.
00:50:15 This is important, all right?
00:50:16 There you go.
00:50:17 This is important context.
00:50:18 You would be leaving out context.
00:50:21 I'm sorry.
00:50:22 You wouldn't be getting all sides of the story
00:50:24 if you didn't include this, so you better fucking...
00:50:28 Yes, sir, Mr. Sains, yes, sir.
00:50:30 Yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir.
00:50:31 That's right, I say jump.
00:50:33 You say hi, okay, good.
00:50:34 Yes, sir.
00:50:36 The publisher you want me to try to Antunes,
00:50:37 please, please, I need your approval.
00:50:40 I will begrudgingly give it to you.
00:50:44 Okay, all right, I'm glad we've sorted that out.
00:50:49 So, all right, well shit,
00:50:51 I don't fucking know anything about Daft Pina
00:50:53 except for what you guys have told me.
00:50:55 Oh, okay, he's like a...
00:50:56 So maybe I'll check the video out
00:50:57 and then maybe I'll know a little something after that.
00:51:00 See?
00:51:00 It releases tomorrow.
00:51:01 Is that good?
00:51:02 That's why I'm comfortable with talking.
00:51:03 Hey.
00:51:05 Hello.
00:51:06 You're an hour late.
00:51:08 Yeah, the clocks went back
00:51:11 and I thought it was now.
00:51:15 That's my excuse.
00:51:17 Wait.
00:51:18 So it is daylight savings.
00:51:18 Wait.
00:51:19 In the UK?
00:51:20 No, it is daylight savings.
00:51:21 That's really stupid
00:51:23 because daylight savings time in America starts next week.
00:51:26 Why wouldn't they just make it the same week?
00:51:29 I have no idea, but it's a consistent problem every year.
00:51:32 I always forget.
00:51:36 Yeah, that's a good excuse though.
00:51:38 Yeah.
00:51:39 That one kind of makes sense.
00:51:40 That one kind of makes sense.
00:51:44 Okay.
00:51:47 Sorry, we were talking about...
00:51:49 Right, Gabe, you know Reborn Pyro from Shreddit.
00:51:53 This is Advil who was just telling us
00:51:55 about his Daft Pina exposed commentary video
00:51:59 that he is in the process of making.
00:52:03 Yeah, and it's a right way to make commentary.
00:52:06 The correct, holy, sanctuary way.
00:52:09 Right, the holy...
00:52:13 The sanctimonious.
00:52:15 We need ethics, we need ethics in commentary.
00:52:17 We need a court, and we need a court of commentary.
00:52:22 Sure.
00:52:23 Exactly, yeah.
00:52:24 Why not?
00:52:25 Oh, we need to make laws.
00:52:26 Why shouldn't there be a grand council?
00:52:28 Exactly, yeah.
00:52:30 We should...
00:52:32 So wild west out there.
00:52:33 I'm trying to...
00:52:35 I'm trying like, how can I make this
00:52:37 like a funny like Holocaust analogy?
00:52:39 No, how can I imply,
00:52:41 how can I imply some kind of horrible war crime
00:52:44 is being committed or some sort of human rights violation?
00:52:47 I mean, it is what's happening.
00:52:49 Antunes is getting decimated by Daft Pina.
00:52:54 That's what I want to happen.
00:52:55 That's what I want to happen.
00:52:57 So it's not a war crime if I like it.
00:53:02 I have no idea who them are.
00:53:04 I think I've conduct Pina before.
00:53:07 What do they do?
00:53:08 They make commentary videos on the art community.
00:53:13 Oh, yeah.
00:53:14 Call it a lot.
00:53:15 And Antunes posts racist comics on Twitter.
00:53:21 Also known as He's Baste.
00:53:24 I'm sorry, okay.
00:53:26 I'm sorry.
00:53:28 And then he posts racist cartoons on Twitter
00:53:31 and makes weird...
00:53:33 Okay, his cartoons are like the funniest thing ever,
00:53:38 but not because they're like funny,
00:53:39 but because it's like amazing that these like exist.
00:53:43 He makes...
00:53:45 Okay, he makes these animations
00:53:48 where he like traces cartoon characters
00:53:50 and he traces them into...
00:53:52 Deathbed.
00:53:54 Of them like standing around another cartoon character's
00:53:57 deathbed and all like mourning
00:53:59 as like they die in a hospital bed.
00:54:01 Yeah, I have to be honest.
00:54:02 That's what he did.
00:54:03 That's his whole thing.
00:54:05 No, I'm glad.
00:54:07 I don't fucking get it.
00:54:08 But he's made like dozens of them.
00:54:10 No matter what I think about Antunes.
00:54:14 If he asked me what I think about them,
00:54:16 which he definitely won't,
00:54:17 because why would he care about my opinion?
00:54:19 But if he did, I would tell him,
00:54:20 I don't understand why that got you
00:54:22 to a million subscribers.
00:54:25 Is that bad to say?
00:54:27 I'm not trying to show him the guy or anything, but like...
00:54:30 That's literally what I'm saying.
00:54:31 So no, I don't think it's bad.
00:54:34 Yeah, he's the muppet guy.
00:54:35 I think I've seen something with him
00:54:38 being a idiot before on Twitter.
00:54:42 He's awful.
00:54:44 He's an awful, awful person.
00:54:47 But...
00:54:51 Yeah, he like was...
00:54:52 He had like a million sub YouTube channel, I think.
00:54:55 Or like maybe 900K or something.
00:54:58 Just because he made these weird like traced,
00:55:03 like fucking Homer Simpson's deathbed video.
00:55:08 And you know, there's no like commentary.
00:55:11 He is not involved in the channel.
00:55:14 Nobody knows like what he's like,
00:55:15 just that he has this channel,
00:55:16 that he makes these deathbed videos.
00:55:18 And then he started getting involved in Twitter drama.
00:55:20 Yeah, it's kind of like the Yo Mama channel.
00:55:23 Like no one knows anything about the Yo Mama channel.
00:55:24 Oh, right.
00:55:26 Right, yeah.
00:55:27 And then he did kind of try to use his YouTube channel
00:55:32 as like a platform to be like,
00:55:33 these people are being rude to me on Twitter
00:55:37 and I'm being deplatformed on Twitter.
00:55:39 And like nobody cared,
00:55:40 because like nobody's there,
00:55:42 nobody's at the YouTube channel to like hear him say stuff.
00:55:46 They're there because they want to see Marge Simpson
00:55:50 like mourning the death of Fred Flintstone or whatever.
00:55:54 Yeah, it is the weirdest pair.
00:55:55 I think it's like purely same channel,
00:55:58 like same like network stuff.
00:56:01 Cause it'll be like Mordecai from regular show,
00:56:04 mourning the death of like Finn.
00:56:07 It should have been Twilight.
00:56:09 Oh my God, he missed an opportunity.
00:56:12 That's a missed opportunity.
00:56:14 That's a missed opportunity.
00:56:16 Okay, I'm going to scrap the interview with him
00:56:18 and ask him why he didn't make it Twilight.
00:56:20 All right, got it.
00:56:21 Look at this, it's WikiTube here
00:56:23 and he's got like the contents and it's like content.
00:56:26 There's three things.
00:56:27 And then controversies is one, two, three, four, five, six,
00:56:30 seven, eight things, subheadings.
00:56:35 Lamau, this guy, oh God.
00:56:39 Seven point to a minor, huh?
00:56:42 Antunes made a commentary video, god damn.
00:56:46 Yeah, he's made some fucking shit.
00:56:48 Well, it was like a review on like rubber hose style
00:56:52 and has over 12 million views.
00:56:56 What the hell?
00:56:57 I don't know, he made a review on rubber hose style?
00:57:01 Yeah, like the cartoon,
00:57:05 like the animation style of rubber hose,
00:57:07 like we're like old Mickey Mouse was rubber hose.
00:57:14 He reviewed cuphead style animation.
00:57:20 Yeah, he like talked about it,
00:57:22 like gave the history about it.
00:57:25 Okay.
00:57:27 12 million is not bad though.
00:57:29 I know, it's a big number.
00:57:31 If this daffy had got to 12 million,
00:57:32 I would probably just sit there.
00:57:35 We'd all love a video to get to 12 million.
00:57:38 I wish, should I just start making death bed videos?
00:57:44 Is that the meta?
00:57:45 I don't think so, I don't think so
00:57:47 because the market is, I feel like it's a saturated market.
00:57:50 Okay, what if I do reincarnated bed?
00:57:54 What?
00:57:54 Reincarnated bed.
00:57:56 Oh, he did one with, ah, boom.
00:58:01 He did one with Freddy Fazbear.
00:58:04 Okay, I don't care about this.
00:58:07 I don't care about this.
00:58:08 I got completely distracted.
00:58:10 Instead of, oh, like they come out of like a death bed
00:58:14 but they wake up.
00:58:15 Birth, I believe birthing bed would be the opposite.
00:58:18 No.
00:58:19 Or a homestuck God tier bed, you know.
00:58:21 It's still like, well, I mean, it's like, you know,
00:58:23 it's like all the cartoon characters gathered
00:58:25 in the manger, like the three wise men,
00:58:28 like for the birth of, you know,
00:58:30 I don't know, Tom from Tom and Jerry or whatever.
00:58:33 I don't know, I don't know what the equivalent would be.
00:58:37 That'd actually be really funny.
00:58:38 I wouldn't mind watching it.
00:58:41 I mean, it's the same, it's the same like weird,
00:58:45 like fixation thing that like made like, you know,
00:58:49 pregnant Elsa, you know, Spider-Man, like popular.
00:58:53 So it's like, it's like some weird like quirk
00:58:56 of human psychology that maybe like children
00:58:59 are clicking on these videos for some reason.
00:59:01 It definitely is, and I can't even be mad at them
00:59:03 because I would do the same thing if I was their age.
00:59:06 The content's not offensive, it's just bizarre.
00:59:10 Yeah, I, it's not like, yeah, indoctrinating.
00:59:12 It's just like a bit weird,
00:59:14 but I can't blame anyone for watching them
00:59:16 because if I was a kid, I would watch them too.
00:59:19 Like 100%.
00:59:21 I don't think, I don't think I would have ever seen
00:59:25 the appeal, but whatever.
00:59:27 I was an idiot when I was a kid, so I probably would.
00:59:30 That was fair, that's reasonable.
00:59:33 Um, Gib, what's, what's up?
00:59:36 What's up?
00:59:38 Well, obviously Halloween has passed
00:59:41 since, while you're listening.
00:59:44 No, it's today.
00:59:45 No, I know it's today, but like two for the viewers.
00:59:47 Halloween's over.
00:59:48 Oh yeah, I didn't even mention that it,
00:59:49 we're recording this on Halloween.
00:59:51 This is Halloween days.
00:59:51 Oh, this is a spooky episode.
00:59:54 No, it's not, it's a week later.
00:59:57 And there's, all the skeletons are dead,
00:59:59 but today I carved a jack-o'-lantern
01:00:01 and that's, that's it.
01:00:04 I hadn't really, I walked the dog,
01:00:05 I carved a jack-o'-lantern,
01:00:06 and then I forgot that the podcast was happening.
01:00:10 Dirty, dirty, dirty.
01:00:13 Dirty.
01:00:14 That was the real scary.
01:00:15 That's cool, I did not carve a pumpkin
01:00:18 and I don't intend to.
01:00:19 I love carving pumpkins.
01:00:21 You know, it's fun.
01:00:22 It's like sculpting.
01:00:24 I do not particularly like Halloween.
01:00:26 I just, I tolerate it.
01:00:28 Do you like Halloween, Gib?
01:00:32 I can appreciate the aesthetic,
01:00:36 but I don't particularly like scary things,
01:00:39 like actually scary movies or games.
01:00:43 They make me pee my pants in my runway.
01:00:48 But like things that are like, ooh, spooky ghosts,
01:00:52 but it's not scary at all.
01:00:53 It's cute, in fact.
01:00:55 That's okay.
01:00:55 It's not that interesting,
01:00:57 but I don't mind it.
01:00:58 What about you, Reborn?
01:01:02 I like, you know, I like the witch outfits,
01:01:06 you know, they're nice.
01:01:09 I love trick-or-treating as kids,
01:01:11 because you know, I'm a fat ass,
01:01:12 so I love that candy.
01:01:14 Fair.
01:01:16 And yeah, I also like it as an excuse to drink.
01:01:19 Dab, dab.
01:01:21 Yeah, as an excuse to hang out with friends or whatever,
01:01:26 like it's as good as any other.
01:01:28 So that's fine.
01:01:30 I appreciate that.
01:01:31 The real scary part of this episode, though,
01:01:34 is when viewers find out
01:01:36 that the first 40 minutes is YouTube drama talk.
01:01:39 Oh, no!
01:01:40 I mean, what else are we gonna do?
01:01:43 Right, you know, fuck it.
01:01:45 We could talk about Twitch drama.
01:01:48 Twitch drama?
01:01:48 Yeah, it's not YouTube drama.
01:01:50 There we go.
01:01:51 Oh, okay.
01:01:52 No, it sucks.
01:01:53 I hate drama, and the drama boys.
01:01:56 Who eat it up.
01:01:57 Yeah, I hate, yeah, I would never.
01:02:01 By the way, subscribe to patreon.com,
01:02:03 slash stuff for Acrassanators
01:02:04 to hear our line-by-line reaction
01:02:07 to Trixie dunking on the Piro Acrassanators podcast
01:02:10 on Who Are These Podcast, link in the description.
01:02:13 I mean, I wasn't particularly excited
01:02:15 to like live react drama gossip about Trixie,
01:02:19 but she attacked me viciously with a knife.
01:02:23 That's true.
01:02:24 I'm called for.
01:02:25 Yeah, I mean, that's definitely true.
01:02:28 Not actually with a knife.
01:02:29 I will admit.
01:02:30 Just in case anyone's not aware,
01:02:31 but you gotta listen to the bonus episode to find out.
01:02:35 I mean, while it is, she definitely started it,
01:02:37 so that's true.
01:02:38 However, I will personally admit
01:02:43 to relishing the opportunity,
01:02:45 not merely as an attempt to defend myself,
01:02:48 but as a...
01:02:49 Means to dunk on someone.
01:02:51 As an offense, yeah, as the means to launch
01:02:54 an offensive salvo of my own.
01:02:56 Yeah.
01:02:57 See, this is the same one in commentary videos.
01:03:00 See, I get it.
01:03:01 I make fun, but I can't really judge anyone.
01:03:05 I get the appeal.
01:03:07 It's just sort of, I see drama happening every so often,
01:03:11 and it's like somebody I've never really heard of.
01:03:14 Oh, this guy's a pedophile.
01:03:17 Oh, this guy was racist.
01:03:19 Oh, that person did this and that,
01:03:21 oh, there's a thing, there's a whole big thing going on,
01:03:23 and there's these people who are keeping track of it
01:03:25 and posting updates and being like,
01:03:27 oh my God, you've seen this thing?
01:03:29 And I'm just like, I don't like that.
01:03:32 I'm so done with any drama.
01:03:34 It just doesn't interest me as like a topic.
01:03:38 I may have mentioned this before.
01:03:40 I'm too far gone.
01:03:41 Every single person online sucks.
01:03:46 Learning that they suck more isn't that interesting.
01:03:49 I may have mentioned this before.
01:03:51 Someone linked me a video that I tried to watch
01:03:54 because it sounded like some drama
01:03:55 that I might be interested in.
01:03:57 It was two people like,
01:03:59 okay, I didn't watch the video,
01:04:00 so I can't confirm any of this,
01:04:01 but supposedly it was a video about how Vita,
01:04:05 remember Vita from Pony Days?
01:04:07 Yeah, vaguely, yes.
01:04:09 About how Vita was a pedophile and was a predator
01:04:14 and was being, and they were like, we're here to cancel him.
01:04:16 And I started watching the video,
01:04:17 and it's these two total charisma vacuum bronies.
01:04:22 Just start back and forth.
01:04:23 They start trading off, they're talking about it.
01:04:25 It's like a 40 minute video,
01:04:27 and I'm like 10 minutes in, maybe not even that much.
01:04:31 And they've spent the entire time, thus far,
01:04:34 not even getting to the point of like,
01:04:36 Vita abused a child or has an underage girlfriend
01:04:40 or whatever the fuck the accusation was supposed to be.
01:04:43 They've spent the entire time being like,
01:04:45 yeah, Vita would like harass the mods
01:04:48 in this Discord server.
01:04:49 Yeah, like Vita gained access to one of our other servers
01:04:52 and like, you know, deleted the whole server
01:04:53 just out of spite.
01:04:54 And it's all a bunch of stupid Discord drama
01:04:57 that is supposed to like,
01:04:58 it's just them airing their grievances
01:05:00 in a way that is maybe supposed to prime me
01:05:02 to like think like, oh yeah, this guy is an asshole.
01:05:05 I'm ready to hear you tell me why he's a pedophile.
01:05:07 But like, God, fucking lead with it, right?
01:05:11 Like, I don't give a shit that you made him
01:05:14 the mod of your server and then he like,
01:05:16 he like did some shit with the permissions you gave him.
01:05:19 I don't fucking care.
01:05:20 Like, tell me what the actual problem is.
01:05:22 I'm wasting my fucking time, right?
01:05:25 Sometimes.
01:05:25 That's probably the, usually the problem
01:05:27 is that it's small potatoes and it's petty.
01:05:31 Usually.
01:05:32 When it's petty, when it's petty,
01:05:33 just like strictly between two individuals,
01:05:36 personal shit, small potatoes, shit,
01:05:39 that's like, that's awful.
01:05:41 Yeah, that's so bad.
01:05:42 I could never hear about it
01:05:44 and it wouldn't affect anything.
01:05:45 Yeah.
01:05:46 And that's, if there's like, oh, you could see
01:05:49 the story being told turned into like a real documentary
01:05:53 that would.
01:05:54 You gotta convince me right off the bat
01:05:57 that this person is out, like, is victimizing people.
01:06:00 If you're leading with like,
01:06:03 he was a mod in my Discord server
01:06:04 and he did not behave appropriately
01:06:08 in terms of the role.
01:06:10 He made, he deleted roles that I liked
01:06:13 and he banned people that I didn't want banned
01:06:16 and it's like, shut the fuck, I don't, nobody cares.
01:06:21 I like commentary, but only the,
01:06:25 not the reaction commentators,
01:06:26 which are like the gameplay commentators
01:06:28 or tea channels.
01:06:30 I just like find some random ass tweet
01:06:33 and just run with it.
01:06:35 I prefer, I think the best commentary
01:06:38 are people that actually take time
01:06:39 and they don't have to care about the topic,
01:06:41 but like put actual effort.
01:06:44 Everything else, it kind of sucks.
01:06:45 Not how I think about it.
01:06:46 I have watched a couple of the right opinion videos before.
01:06:50 He's pretty good.
01:06:51 I thought they were pretty okay.
01:06:53 A lot of people call me boring, but I can say that.
01:06:56 I often find.
01:06:58 I don't have much to compare him to.
01:06:59 Commentary channels.
01:07:01 It's like the, it just feels like,
01:07:05 what if you made a YouTube comment, but it was a video?
01:07:09 And I'm like, ah, you know,
01:07:11 I don't really want to listen to a YouTube comment.
01:07:14 Like it, the commentary as a,
01:07:18 like a community or like a genre of video,
01:07:21 it feels like there's not a lot of meat.
01:07:25 There's not a lot of things you can really do with that.
01:07:28 It's entirely dependent on how interesting
01:07:30 the thing you're reacting to is.
01:07:32 And in that same vein, I often feel like
01:07:36 they're, they're like equivalent to
01:07:39 YouTube channels or like, like Facebook groups that like
01:07:44 put a, but like, here's the viral clip of the week.
01:07:47 Here's the viral video that's really funny.
01:07:49 Here you go.
01:07:50 And they're like barely doing anything.
01:07:51 They're just pointing your attention towards a thing
01:07:54 that is entertaining on its own.
01:07:56 And you could just go and see that thing.
01:07:58 A lot of, like a lot of like podcasts or even like, you know,
01:08:02 it's less like, not calling you guys up by the way,
01:08:05 but it's just like, like, it's just like, like, you know,
01:08:09 or not even podcasts, just like every YouTube video.
01:08:12 It's just thing of thing, like story time.
01:08:15 Hey, here's my story of the week.
01:08:17 It could be the most boring shit ever,
01:08:19 but here's my story of the week, you know?
01:08:21 No matter what medium you're in,
01:08:23 I feel like you can, you can make it as entertaining
01:08:26 as you put into it or like as engaging as you put into it.
01:08:31 I'm not sure.
01:08:31 I think a lot of YouTube is that in various ways.
01:08:35 I mean, a lot of videos about things
01:08:38 that aren't made by like smart people are just,
01:08:41 here's a Wikipedia article turned into a video for you.
01:08:44 Hey, that's me.
01:08:45 It's like, that's a lot of those things.
01:08:47 I'm like, hey, I guess it's interesting,
01:08:50 but like nothing new is being created.
01:08:52 It's all just redirecting your attention
01:08:55 towards things that have already been done,
01:08:57 already been seen, already been made.
01:09:01 Yeah.
01:09:03 I mean, the podcast thing is like, it's true.
01:09:06 We just do talk about whatever.
01:09:08 But I just think that like for every medium,
01:09:12 it's just what you put into it.
01:09:13 Cause you could just write like a,
01:09:15 you could just like,
01:09:17 if you want to do like a story time video,
01:09:19 you could just like make a blog,
01:09:22 but the medium of video makes it so much like more engaging
01:09:26 and you know, just so much more like entertaining
01:09:30 rather than having someone just read,
01:09:33 you know, your blog or your book or whatever.
01:09:35 And I feel like a lot of times people just miss out on that
01:09:39 by creating very non-interesting like,
01:09:43 you know, like, like video, you know?
01:09:46 And I do agree, you know?
01:09:49 Uh, uh, what, huh?
01:09:51 Like a story time.
01:09:52 I mean, a story is like, like art.
01:09:55 Like, uh, like a video game or a movie or whatever.
01:10:00 That's a story.
01:10:01 Joel Haver makes short films.
01:10:03 Yeah.
01:10:04 I love those videos.
01:10:05 They're just like a little story told.
01:10:07 Well, usually very funny.
01:10:12 And that's the sort of content I like.
01:10:15 But when it's, when it's somebody just doing a vlog
01:10:18 for like watch time or engagement,
01:10:21 there's not a lot to it.
01:10:23 I will say that, um, like if you put a lot of effort
01:10:26 into telling a small little story,
01:10:30 often stories are not like made for people like me
01:10:34 because I'm old now.
01:10:35 It's for young youngsters,
01:10:37 like YouTube animators, story time people.
01:10:40 Yeah.
01:10:41 They make very engaging animated little stories about,
01:10:43 oh, this is a thing that's relatable to you.
01:10:45 And they're all like, oh, he is.
01:10:47 Oh.
01:10:49 I've been to school once.
01:10:50 Literally me.
01:10:51 Literally me.
01:10:53 And it's like, okay, I don't care for it myself,
01:10:56 but like, that's all right.
01:10:57 Don't mind those.
01:10:58 Why?
01:10:59 They're making something.
01:11:00 They're telling all,
01:11:01 they're gathering people around the campfire.
01:11:04 I guess, I guess that's what commentary.
01:11:06 I hate this conversation we're having.
01:11:08 God, I'm so fucking bored.
01:11:09 Shut up.
01:11:10 Oh my God.
01:11:11 All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
01:11:12 Let's discuss the important stuff.
01:11:15 The moral background of commentary.
01:11:17 No.
01:11:18 Let's go back.
01:11:19 I'll kill you.
01:11:19 I'll fucking kill you.
01:11:22 Let's talk about, you know, Trixie.
01:11:26 She moves.
01:11:26 Riley, he produces.
01:11:30 What?
01:11:31 You know.
01:11:32 What?
01:11:33 What does Riley produce?
01:11:35 Nothing.
01:11:35 He just produces.
01:11:38 I mean, true.
01:11:38 Yeah, he just, he produces whatever that means.
01:11:42 Whatever that needs to mean at the time.
01:11:44 No, I don't want to talk about that.
01:11:45 I don't care.
01:11:47 Let's, the fucking,
01:11:50 well, hey, do you guys see the news?
01:11:51 Oh God.
01:11:52 What?
01:11:53 What?
01:11:54 No, what?
01:11:55 What?
01:11:56 I was going to ask you how your game's going.
01:11:58 Fuck you.
01:11:59 It's like compared to like.
01:12:01 My game, Phantom's Revenge, I'm back,
01:12:03 I finished the Lord of Ghost comic.
01:12:06 Yes.
01:12:06 I'm back on the grind for the Phantom's Revenge game
01:12:12 development numbers is good.
01:12:16 What did I do?
01:12:17 I fixed a bunch of visual, but yes, two days ago,
01:12:19 I fixed a bunch of visual bugs.
01:12:22 Yesterday, I was like completing a bunch of commands
01:12:25 and making a bunch.
01:12:26 I have successfully implemented the dab command.
01:12:29 Oh my God.
01:12:30 Phantom Warren can now dab in the game.
01:12:31 Sick.
01:12:32 So I, yeah, yeah.
01:12:36 What else?
01:12:37 What else?
01:12:38 I fixed a glitch with the screen,
01:12:43 the screen shake when you take damage.
01:12:46 Yeah, I'm on it.
01:12:47 I'm focused.
01:12:49 It's going good actually.
01:12:50 And I showed, I said I wasn't going to do this.
01:12:53 I actually like kind of betrayed myself a little bit.
01:12:56 I showed myself playing a bit of the game on the stream
01:13:02 on the Shackles for Heckles we did yesterday.
01:13:04 I showed more than I had meant to show actually publicly,
01:13:08 but fuck it, it's fine.
01:13:10 So if you want to go listen to that stream we did yesterday,
01:13:16 you might, and you're interested,
01:13:17 you might find some secret knowledge
01:13:21 about my video game in there.
01:13:23 No, I have two questions for you.
01:13:26 Number one, are you going to sign an exclusivity deal
01:13:29 with Epic Game Store and release all the way on there?
01:13:33 Absolutely.
01:13:34 Well, yeah, NFTs will be incorporated into the game.
01:13:37 You will have to buy real life NFTs
01:13:40 in order to progress.
01:13:42 Jesus Christ.
01:13:43 Only people with an NFT can get in and play the game.
01:13:47 Otherwise she dies only.
01:13:50 What's your game about?
01:13:52 I wasn't here for that arc, what's your game about?
01:13:54 What's it about?
01:13:56 It is the, well, it's the conclusion
01:13:59 of my comic Slime and Punishment
01:14:01 and it is called Phantom's Revenge.
01:14:04 And it features Phantom Horn, the unicorn, fighting enemies.
01:14:12 And I think that's all I'm going to say here about it.
01:14:14 That is.
01:14:15 If you watch the sample I showed in the stream,
01:14:19 actually gives away a bit more of the context
01:14:22 that I had not publicly talked about it before.
01:14:25 So the second question I was going to ask you is,
01:14:27 I didn't actually know you were making a game.
01:14:30 What genre is it?
01:14:31 I don't talk about it that much.
01:14:34 What is the, what is it?
01:14:36 Oh, I asked what genre it was.
01:14:38 Is it action, platformer?
01:14:41 It's a, I would say it's a turn-based like JRPG.
01:14:46 Oh, sick.
01:14:47 But it's with sort of a,
01:14:52 most strictly speaking, yeah,
01:14:53 it's a turn-based menu-based JRPG,
01:14:57 but it sort of has the vibe
01:14:58 of like a side-scrolling beat-em-up where you go,
01:15:02 where basically you just, you go like from left to right,
01:15:05 from room to room and you, you know, you clear enemies out.
01:15:09 Yeah, there's no like overworld, there's not RPG maker.
01:15:13 It's a unique little thing.
01:15:15 It's a linear, it's a linear,
01:15:17 it's a beat-em-up that you do with menu commands, basically.
01:15:22 Yeah, it's a strategy.
01:15:25 I put the demo out on my Patreon a few months ago,
01:15:30 and it was really hard.
01:15:32 It was really hard.
01:15:33 Very, very few people were able to beat it.
01:15:36 So the final release will not be,
01:15:38 I'm good, I'm making some changes
01:15:40 to make it a little bit more forgiving.
01:15:41 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you got,
01:15:44 no, you don't understand.
01:15:46 You should make like an insane mode.
01:15:47 You gotta make it grind people's testicles
01:15:49 or their titties, you know?
01:15:50 Honestly, I could make an insane,
01:15:53 if I made the insane mode.
01:15:54 That'd be sick.
01:15:56 Yeah, you get a funny achievement for it.
01:15:58 Yeah, if I made an insane mode that took out the ability
01:16:02 to like rest between rooms or whatever that would be,
01:16:07 because the demo, if you beat one room,
01:16:09 you had to immediately go to the next.
01:16:10 In the final game, you're gonna be able
01:16:12 to like prepare between rooms a little bit.
01:16:15 Yeah, you should just insane mode,
01:16:16 just what is called boss rush.
01:16:20 Boss rush, there's not many bosses in it.
01:16:23 So what is the process been like of making a game?
01:16:26 Because I've never really-
01:16:27 I don't know, you fucking open Game Maker
01:16:29 and you go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
01:16:31 and you put things in parentheses
01:16:32 and you put in semicolons, and it just fucking works.
01:16:35 All right, speaking of video games,
01:16:37 I found something absolutely magical today.
01:16:39 Well, found is the wrong word, but it was linked to me
01:16:43 and I'm already in love looking at this.
01:16:47 Sonic Robo Blast 2 Persona Edition.
01:16:52 What?
01:16:52 Where?
01:16:53 What does that mean?
01:16:54 What?
01:16:55 It is a fan-made Persona game with Sonic characters
01:17:00 and Sonic levels.
01:17:02 Oh, okay, okay, okay.
01:17:05 I just, oh, I should put it in links, I'm my bad.
01:17:08 Now I get it, now I understand.
01:17:10 Yeah, it-
01:17:11 Why does this actually kinda look good?
01:17:12 That's what I'm saying, it looks actually very good.
01:17:16 It does, this actually looks really cool.
01:17:20 Yeah.
01:17:23 Oh, man.
01:17:23 Holy shit.
01:17:24 It apparently supports four teams of four players
01:17:27 so you could play with 15 other friends.
01:17:30 I mean, who has 15 friends, but, you know.
01:17:33 I don't know.
01:17:34 I was knowing 15 Sonic characters.
01:17:36 There are?
01:17:37 I really like this a lot, actually.
01:17:39 Yeah, okay.
01:17:40 You guys like Sonic?
01:17:42 Yeah.
01:17:43 No.
01:17:44 No?
01:17:44 Why'd they like it?
01:17:45 I've never played a Sonic game.
01:17:47 Damn.
01:17:48 I see how it is.
01:17:48 Yeah, I see what you like.
01:17:49 It's one of those series that has just been around
01:17:52 but I've never really played.
01:17:54 I think I had Shadow the Hedgehog
01:17:56 was the only Sonic game I had as a kid.
01:17:59 What games did you guys grow up on?
01:18:02 I played a bunch, I played a,
01:18:05 I mean, my favorite games as a kid were like,
01:18:07 were SNES RPGs, like Mario RPG and Secret of Mana and.
01:18:11 Yo, Mario RPG, that's a good game.
01:18:13 I respect that.
01:18:14 That's, yeah, that's probably my childhood fave
01:18:17 was Mario RPG.
01:18:18 What about you, Gib?
01:18:20 I was in PS1 for a bit and then PS2 mostly
01:18:26 is a wretched and clank, Jack and Dexter.
01:18:28 Hell yeah.
01:18:29 Tomb Raider 1, Rayman.
01:18:32 Oh, did you play Crash?
01:18:35 I did, yes.
01:18:36 I didn't have Crash for some reason.
01:18:38 I never beat, I never beat Crash.
01:18:40 I never beat Crash.
01:18:41 Dude, Crash is so good.
01:18:42 I had a weird situation.
01:18:45 So I had a Nintendo 64 growing up
01:18:48 and then I got a PS2 a little later on.
01:18:51 But well, the weird part is I never got a GameCube
01:18:53 or a Wii for a very, very long time.
01:18:56 So I played like Ocarina of Time and I grew up on that.
01:18:59 But then I also grew up on Ratchet and Clank
01:19:03 because those are my favorite action RPGs.
01:19:06 The guns are just amazing.
01:19:08 It's so fun.
01:19:10 I wouldn't call Ratchet and Clank an action RPG.
01:19:14 You can level up the guns in two and three, so I guess.
01:19:18 Yeah, I would, I think that's a straight.
01:19:21 I mean, you have some RPG element.
01:19:23 It's an action, it's a 3D action.
01:19:26 Adventure game with RPG element.
01:19:27 It's a third person shooter platform.
01:19:30 Yeah, or if you played Deadlock, it's a arena shooter
01:19:34 slash RPG.
01:19:35 Oh, Ratchet fucking bread, Dread.
01:19:41 Ratchet Gladiator was called in the UK.
01:19:43 I love that shit.
01:19:44 Hell yeah, same.
01:19:45 I remember getting that for Christmas
01:19:47 and I played it like after I'd opened the presents.
01:19:51 I had it and I just played the whole entire game.
01:19:55 And then it was dark.
01:19:56 I remember, so I didn't have an internet
01:19:59 at my house at the time and there was always
01:20:01 a big sticker on the box that says play online
01:20:04 with PlayStation.
01:20:05 And there was one time me and my family
01:20:08 were staying at a hotel somewhere
01:20:09 and I actually hooked it up to the PS2
01:20:12 and got to play online for the first time
01:20:14 and it was really fun.
01:20:17 That is like a-
01:20:18 You can never figure out, what do you need to do
01:20:20 to get a PlayStation 2 to be online?
01:20:26 I thought you needed a funny adapter thing.
01:20:29 Yeah, you did need, I think, I remember
01:20:31 we had to buy some kind of adapter
01:20:33 to play Ratchet and Clank Arena online.
01:20:36 God, that shit was so fun.
01:20:37 It was.
01:20:38 That was awesome.
01:20:39 Wait, so were you guys Nintendo kids at all?
01:20:42 I had no, I switched from the Super Nintendo
01:20:47 to the PlayStation because I wanted to play Final Fantasy 7.
01:20:54 So I started with Nintendo and then switched to Sony
01:20:56 when PlayStation came out.
01:20:58 I mean, I had the consoles was always Sony.
01:21:03 And then I had a Game Boy Advance SP
01:21:07 and then a DS Lite.
01:21:09 No, I didn't have a DS Lite.
01:21:10 I had, I started, I was borrowing my brother's DS lights
01:21:15 and then I got like a DSi XL and then a 3DS.
01:21:19 So I was like portable Nintendo,
01:21:23 like Phoenix Wright and shit.
01:21:25 Oh yeah, I still had, I still had GBA
01:21:28 and I think I got the S.
01:21:29 Was it the SD after the GBA?
01:21:32 Yes.
01:21:33 Yeah, yeah.
01:21:33 No, wait.
01:21:34 Yeah, so I continued to be a Nintendo portable kid.
01:21:38 The same.
01:21:39 Advance, I think?
01:21:40 Yeah.
01:21:41 I only got the-
01:21:42 No, after Advance.
01:21:44 I definitely had the Advance and was it the SP after the SP?
01:21:47 Yeah, yeah, it was the SP.
01:21:48 The one, the silver one with the flip up screen.
01:21:52 Yes, yes, yes.
01:21:54 I remember fucking, I only cared about the Game Boy and DS.
01:21:58 Like I had to have them exclusively for Pokemon
01:22:01 and no other reason.
01:22:03 Were you guys play Pokemon?
01:22:06 I know a bunch of people that didn't and it's like-
01:22:09 That's funny.
01:22:10 It's so weird.
01:22:12 We have been criticized for talking too much
01:22:14 about Pokemon on this channel.
01:22:18 I mean, it's been a while.
01:22:20 Let's talk about Pokemon.
01:22:22 Yeah, I played red and then I played,
01:22:25 no, I played blue and then I played silver
01:22:26 and then I skipped gen three and then I played pearl
01:22:29 and then I played, was it, was it,
01:22:32 was black and white after pearl and diamonds?
01:22:34 Yeah.
01:22:35 Well, there was black one, but yeah.
01:22:37 I played black.
01:22:39 No, I bounced off black and then I didn't play
01:22:42 another one for a while.
01:22:45 Yeah, I played a bunch, played a bunch of Pokemon.
01:22:48 I have played blue and then I had Sapphire
01:22:52 and that's like my big nostalgia one.
01:22:56 And then I didn't care much for other stuff
01:23:00 because I think it was like, I was used to it being
01:23:04 like pixelated little drawings
01:23:07 and then they started experimenting
01:23:09 with having three dimensional buildings and stuff.
01:23:12 And I'm like, that's fucked.
01:23:13 That's incorrect.
01:23:14 You thought that was fucked?
01:23:15 They're ruining my game.
01:23:17 Wait until, just you wait, you didn't know,
01:23:19 young Gabe didn't know just how fucked
01:23:20 things were gonna get.
01:23:22 I had a little gamer moment where I was like,
01:23:25 no, things on the GBA, they look great.
01:23:29 Fire Emblem, right?
01:23:30 Fire Emblem seven and eight, perfect looking games,
01:23:33 incredible, great little sprite animations
01:23:35 on all the little people.
01:23:37 Then GameCube, Fire Emblem comes out, looks like shit
01:23:41 because it's like low poly 3D renders,
01:23:44 no good animation at all.
01:23:46 And I was seeing that as well with other games.
01:23:48 It was like, 3D versions of once two dimensional properties.
01:23:52 These fucking 3D Pokemon houses, this Pokemon center,
01:23:56 looks like crap.
01:23:57 I hate it.
01:23:58 And then I didn't play Pokemon at all until Pokemon Moon.
01:24:01 I thought the limited 3D stuff looked pretty good
01:24:05 It does look good.
01:24:06 I was just like an ancient for a reason.
01:24:08 And then like, was it in, was it,
01:24:13 yeah, like fourth and fifth gen had some 3D house and stuff.
01:24:17 Some pseudo 3D stuff and then actual 3D.
01:24:19 And they looked really good.
01:24:21 Yeah, they looked good.
01:24:22 And then they fucked it all up.
01:24:23 And then they fucked it all up, believe me.
01:24:25 I did enjoy playing Pokemon Moon.
01:24:25 If a little 3D looks good,
01:24:27 everything would look good in 3D.
01:24:29 Now, Sun and Moon suck, Sun and Moon are shit, honestly.
01:24:32 Yeah, Sun and X, Y, Sun and Moon.
01:24:33 Sun and Moon have gotten worse over time.
01:24:35 All right, yeah.
01:24:36 Well, I like the music from them.
01:24:36 I still listen to those.
01:24:38 Yeah, every Pokemon game has good music.
01:24:40 Yeah, I wouldn't play it again, God, no.
01:24:43 But like it had the team skull, that was epic.
01:24:46 Here's the hot take of this episode.
01:24:48 And the characters were cool.
01:24:50 Here's the hot take of this episode.
01:24:53 The 3D stuff and starting with gen six,
01:24:56 I don't think it was bad.
01:24:58 I liked the new designs.
01:24:59 I liked the quirky way the world looked.
01:25:02 I just hated the fact that the DS
01:25:04 couldn't handle double battles in 3D.
01:25:07 So it lagged, like even the 3DS.
01:25:09 Like if you play Sun and Moon,
01:25:11 especially the re-release of them, Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon,
01:25:15 and you get into a double battle,
01:25:17 oh my God, the frame rate drops
01:25:18 to 10 frames a second sometimes.
01:25:20 And the battles just go by so slow because they're lagging.
01:25:24 I had the new 3DS too, which was the upgraded one.
01:25:28 The one that's supposed to be more powerful
01:25:30 and it was just lagging so bad.
01:25:32 Like 3D was okay, but not for a console
01:25:36 that couldn't handle it.
01:25:38 I remember when he fucked me up sometimes.
01:25:40 I think the move to 3D was just bad in every way.
01:25:43 It looks worse and it plays worse.
01:25:46 You know, like I did it for black and white.
01:25:49 Like they should have done like what Sonic,
01:25:50 like Sonic Persona did and have 2D sprites walking around
01:25:54 in a big 3D world.
01:25:55 That would have been badass.
01:25:56 Honestly, maybe it would have worked, I don't know.
01:25:58 It would have been a bold decision though,
01:26:00 considering how like every other game company was doing.
01:26:04 But it would definitely make them stand out.
01:26:06 And Pokemon was already so big at the time,
01:26:08 and then it didn't matter.
01:26:12 It's like no matter what happened,
01:26:14 people would have bought it, you know?
01:26:17 Yeah, fuck the crew.
01:26:18 It's still true today, haha.
01:26:19 Yeah, it's true, it's true.
01:26:22 It really fucked me up that sometimes like a game
01:26:27 built for a console cannot run well on that console.
01:26:31 Yeah.
01:26:32 Like there was a moment in Professor Layton
01:26:36 versus Phoenix Wright on DS, which is a 3DS,
01:26:40 which is a game I really like,
01:26:42 but there's like this one core section.
01:26:44 I can't remember your review of it.
01:26:45 Where there's like a bunch of characters on screen,
01:26:49 cause it's like they interview like a group
01:26:52 of some or of knights or something.
01:26:55 And you know, they're all wacky and cool models,
01:26:57 but because of there being so many fucking vertices
01:27:00 and points on screen at once,
01:27:02 the fucking DS 3DS can't handle it and it lags
01:27:05 and it just ruins like the game.
01:27:08 That's just the way the game is.
01:27:09 You can't play, you can emulate it.
01:27:12 Nice.
01:27:12 But like it was built for that and it just doesn't run.
01:27:15 How do they cool?
01:27:17 How do they sleep at night knowing that they made a video game
01:27:20 that wasn't quite up to standard?
01:27:23 That's a great question.
01:27:25 Nobody knows.
01:27:29 That's why everybody gets mad at Pokemon
01:27:31 because oh, you guys rake in millions of dollars,
01:27:33 but you can't optimize your games properly.
01:27:36 What the fuck?
01:27:38 Yeah.
01:27:39 No, I can think that I can.
01:27:41 Sad, but true.
01:27:42 Sad, but true.
01:27:43 I feel like there's like an interesting
01:27:44 like secretive documentary on like why Pokemon is just bad?
01:27:48 Cause it's like it doesn't make any sense
01:27:49 why they just don't do it right.
01:27:54 You know, you go, you get a guy on the inside.
01:27:57 They just don't give a fuck.
01:27:58 They sneak around the office.
01:27:59 They just don't give a fuck.
01:28:00 They get private conversations of like the developers
01:28:04 at Game Freak being like, ha, ha, ha,
01:28:06 I don't care about what I'm doing.
01:28:08 Ha, ha, ha.
01:28:09 And then it was like, oh my God, what a scoop.
01:28:11 Yeah.
01:28:17 True though, true though.
01:28:19 Um, okay.
01:28:23 All right, I don't care.
01:28:23 I don't care about Pokemon.
01:28:25 I don't care about anything.
01:28:27 This doesn't, this don't matter.
01:28:28 You care about Yu-Gi-Oh. None of this matters.
01:28:32 I don't.
01:28:32 I don't like Yu-Gi-Oh.
01:28:34 Did you guys see, all right.
01:28:37 This week on YouTube.
01:28:40 What?
01:28:41 What, they're still making Yu-Gi-Oh?
01:28:43 Yeah, I did.
01:28:45 Stop.
01:28:46 Like cards or the show?
01:28:47 Both, all the above.
01:28:49 Cards, video games, everything.
01:28:53 I'm just kidding, I know,
01:28:54 I know that they're still doing that.
01:28:56 I wish they wouldn't.
01:28:57 Actually, no, I don't.
01:28:59 I stopped giving a shit after.
01:29:00 I don't actually mind it, it's fine, it's fine.
01:29:02 I stopped giving a shit after.
01:29:03 I wanted to say, this week on YouTube,
01:29:05 with two monumental videos dropped on YouTube this week.
01:29:11 One of which I expected and was anticipated.
01:29:15 The other, which was a total surprise.
01:29:17 Do you guys know what I'm talking about?
01:29:18 Probably not.
01:29:19 No clue.
01:29:20 Okay.
01:29:21 Well, the one I was expecting
01:29:23 was the new Tim Rogers action button review
01:29:26 of Cyberpunk 2077.
01:29:28 After like, what's it been like 10 months
01:29:30 since the Tokimeki Memorial review,
01:29:34 the new action button dropped.
01:29:37 And it is a sprawling epic
01:29:41 that was so big that it had to be split into like,
01:29:43 it had to be split into like seven videos.
01:29:45 Holy shit.
01:29:47 For some reason, it's, I don't know, it's good.
01:29:51 How long are all the videos?
01:29:52 Honestly, I don't even have that much to say about it.
01:29:53 It's an action button, it's good, huh?
01:29:57 How long are all the videos?
01:29:59 They vary, some of them are,
01:30:01 he started out making them maybe like two hours or so,
01:30:05 but they like, they got longer longer.
01:30:07 I think the Tokimeki Memorial one is like five hours long.
01:30:11 And this one is probably like nine or 10 hours
01:30:14 all total or something.
01:30:17 I don't know, action button is weird
01:30:19 because it's really not even about the game.
01:30:20 It's basically just, I mean, he does talk about the game,
01:30:24 but he also just like rambles about himself
01:30:27 and random shit a lot.
01:30:29 And probably some people would find that annoying,
01:30:34 which is fine.
01:30:37 That's valid.
01:30:40 Yeah.
01:30:42 Let's talk about something, you know,
01:30:44 not too spicy here, politics.
01:30:48 No, I wanted, fuck, no, my other video,
01:30:51 I said there were two videos.
01:30:53 Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
01:30:54 Another big video that I need to recommend,
01:30:57 that I need to recommend.
01:30:57 I want everyone to go and watch,
01:31:00 yeah, the new, the new Yan Misali video.
01:31:02 Did you see this?
01:31:04 What was that?
01:31:05 Yan Misali is a guy, he does, he's a conlanger.
01:31:11 He like made video reviews,
01:31:13 where he reviewed constructed languages,
01:31:16 stuff like Esperanto, and he would review them
01:31:19 and be like, how good is it as a language?
01:31:21 How shit is it as a language?
01:31:22 What's wrong with it?
01:31:23 How could it be better?
01:31:25 And then he was moderately successful doing that,
01:31:28 and then he recently branched
01:31:29 into doing more like YouTube-y stuff.
01:31:31 He did a big iceberg video about the Rhythm Heaven series.
01:31:35 He did a video exploring how many,
01:31:40 how many Mario games are like,
01:31:42 are considered part of the mainline Mario series,
01:31:45 and which ones are they?
01:31:46 That one's pretty interesting.
01:31:48 And his new one, which is Who Made Caramel Dancin,
01:31:52 is a masterpiece.
01:31:53 Oh, I saw that.
01:31:54 That was a great one.
01:31:55 It's so good.
01:31:56 It's so good.
01:31:57 Wait, who's this guy?
01:31:59 His name is Yan Misali, that's J-A-N,
01:32:02 and then space M-I-S-A-L-I.
01:32:06 And there's so much to the story of Caramel Dancin
01:32:13 that I just didn't know.
01:32:15 Who would have thought?
01:32:17 But it's true.
01:32:18 Yeah, it's weird.
01:32:19 I found the Caramella Girls just randomly,
01:32:23 and I was like, oh, I guess they made it.
01:32:25 I guess this is what they're unable to do with YouTube channel,
01:32:27 and I would have been fooled.
01:32:28 You would think so.
01:32:29 Yeah, it's a whole, yeah, a bit of a spoiler,
01:32:32 but it's a whole, yeah, the band,
01:32:35 that pretends to be responsible for Caramel Dancin
01:32:40 is just like a later invention
01:32:42 by the record label that owned the song,
01:32:46 and just is out here sitting on a throne of lies.
01:32:53 Amazing, it's amazing.
01:32:57 Yeah, great, that was a great video,
01:32:59 and I just wanted to fucking, oh, oh, oh, but yeah,
01:33:04 but in that video, he explained,
01:33:06 oh, this ties into the Trixie thing,
01:33:09 the Who Are These podcast,
01:33:11 because in The Who Are These podcast,
01:33:12 they make fun of me.
01:33:13 They rightfully make fun of me
01:33:15 for not knowing the lyrics to,
01:33:18 or the name, in fact, of a, fuck, what song was it?
01:33:24 Blitzkrieg, boop, Blitzkrieg bop.
01:33:27 I didn't know the lyrics to Blitzkrieg bop,
01:33:28 and I interpreted them as let's get fucked,
01:33:32 which is a phenomenon that I learned from that video,
01:33:37 from that Yan Misli video, it's called Mondegreen,
01:33:40 or in Japanese, Sora Mimi,
01:33:42 the practice of interpreting another song
01:33:46 in a different language in your own language,
01:33:49 just based on mishearing the words.
01:33:51 So yeah, I Mondegreened, Blitzkrieg, boop,
01:33:54 so it wasn't, it's not an L, it's not an L.
01:33:56 I was doing a Mondegreen, actually, it was W.
01:33:59 Yeah, yeah, so.
01:34:02 Wait, do you know what the actual lyric is?
01:34:05 Or probably not.
01:34:06 Yeah, it's Blitzkrieg, swedish.
01:34:07 Oh, okay, now I know.
01:34:08 Oh, you mean Blitzkrieg, boop, I don't know.
01:34:11 Some sort of words.
01:34:13 Cause, I-
01:34:14 Blitzkrieg, boop.
01:34:15 Blitzkrieg, boop.
01:34:16 Wait, Blitzkrieg, boop, let's get fucked, okay.
01:34:20 Sorry, sorry, it just sounds like that to me.
01:34:24 And that's valid, and no one can take that away from me.
01:34:28 I just, yeah, when he said the Mondegreen thing,
01:34:31 I was like, oh, just like me and Blitzkrieg, boop.
01:34:35 Relatable, this is literally me right now.
01:34:38 Huh?
01:34:39 There's like a Reddit thread dedicated to
01:34:41 let's get fucked, bitch, Blitzkrieg, boop.
01:34:44 Excuse me?
01:34:45 Yeah.
01:34:46 So I'm not the only one.
01:34:46 No.
01:34:47 So I'm not the only one.
01:34:48 No, you're good.
01:34:49 Excuse me, did you just bring up Reddit?
01:34:52 Read.
01:34:53 Oh, fuck.
01:34:54 I mean, I'm in 4chan, I'm in 4chan,
01:34:57 I'm in 4chan.
01:34:58 Disavow, disavow, double disavow.
01:34:59 No, link me, link me the thread about,
01:35:00 link me the thread.
01:35:01 It's not a thread about it, it's about what song
01:35:03 you've been miss hearing, but there's like
01:35:05 three people talking about Blitzkrieg, boop.
01:35:08 That's, that's great.
01:35:10 Speaking of, how long am I gonna con, blitz?
01:35:15 Speaking of threads, yeah, I always,
01:35:17 seven years ago, Jetsetter underscore says,
01:35:19 I always thought that Blitzkrieg, boop was let's get fucked.
01:35:23 Some friends pointed out my idiocy just a few weeks ago.
01:35:25 Same, except for me, it was my mortal enemy
01:35:28 that pointed it out, cool.
01:35:31 This reminds me.
01:35:32 Oh, I love that, I love that.
01:35:33 Given Ben.
01:35:34 Okay, amazing.
01:35:35 Mon de Green, think about it.
01:35:36 How big of a fan are you two of Kingdom Hearts?
01:35:41 I played one and two, and chain of memories.
01:35:45 So I used to be kind of a fan.
01:35:47 I played one and two sort of recently
01:35:51 for YouTube videos that I made on the first one.
01:35:54 I never made the second one,
01:35:56 but I enjoyed them a fair amount, they're pretty good.
01:35:59 Okay, this is-
01:36:00 I think I played the third game as well
01:36:02 because that was hype, I just felt like it.
01:36:04 Okay, okay, so you two will very much appreciate this.
01:36:07 I'll post in the links.
01:36:10 I was linked this thread as it was happening
01:36:13 and this is the funniest thing I've ever seen
01:36:16 come from 4chan.
01:36:20 Yeah, click it and read it real quick.
01:36:23 In the reply, where is it?
01:36:25 I posted in the links.
01:36:28 Oh, indeed, I request a large cheese pizza,
01:36:35 plain of, cheese pie of pizza, plain of course.
01:36:39 Us nothing's required, nothing on our meals.
01:36:42 A side beverage of a Dr. Pepper.
01:36:44 Wait, we gotta post the image.
01:36:48 The image needs to go along with this.
01:36:51 Here we go.
01:36:53 So here's the image, and yeah.
01:36:56 Indeed, I request a large cheese pie of pizza,
01:36:59 plain of course, us nothing's require,
01:37:01 nothing on our meals.
01:37:03 A side beverage of a Dr. Pepper.
01:37:04 The ideal drink between drinks.
01:37:07 Oh, and how foolish of me.
01:37:08 Do not forget the garlic knots.
01:37:11 I will be waiting to pay in cash.
01:37:13 Please alert your courier to knock three times
01:37:16 at the door of Castle Oblivion,
01:37:18 so we are aware of his presence.
01:37:20 And it just keeps-
01:37:21 I shifted into Xemnas mode.
01:37:24 It just keeps going.
01:37:25 Oh, and then they just RP in character
01:37:28 for the whole thread.
01:37:29 The Sora ones are the funny ones.
01:37:32 Don't you remember Xemnas?
01:37:33 The savory, tasty, greasy cheese.
01:37:35 The sour feeling of tomato toppings.
01:37:40 If that's my favorite one,
01:37:41 there's a picture of salad in it and it's like too late.
01:37:44 I'm already going half and half.
01:37:47 Okay, all right, this is pretty good.
01:37:55 It goes on for so long too.
01:37:58 It just keeps-
01:37:58 Oh my God.
01:37:59 Yeah, it just keeps going.
01:38:01 I see Woody from Toy Story.
01:38:05 There he is.
01:38:06 Wait, wait, wait, I got this one.
01:38:09 I want to read this one.
01:38:10 I want to read this one.
01:38:12 I'm posting the image here.
01:38:14 Pizzas quivering with cheese.
01:38:17 Pizzas burning with pepperoni.
01:38:20 Pizzas scarred by anchovies.
01:38:22 That fool Ansem said the pizza's true nature
01:38:25 was beyond his understanding,
01:38:27 but it's not beyond mine.
01:38:30 Pizzas are the source of all power.
01:38:36 He's ascended.
01:38:37 All right, all right, all right.
01:38:39 Good thread, good thread.
01:38:41 Behold, these dried toppings used to be full of flavor,
01:38:46 united with the taste of their customers.
01:38:49 And this barren kitchen key cards of crepitant debt
01:38:52 of what were locked in combat
01:38:54 has a great three-for-one special rage.
01:38:57 Countless customers emptied their wallets
01:38:59 in search of one ultimate taste.
01:39:01 And soon it will belong to me, the X-Car.
01:39:08 Do you-
01:39:09 The idea of a key card instead of a key blade.
01:39:14 Dude, how many, dude, can you churn,
01:39:17 can you churn key blade cards?
01:39:18 What's the cashback rate on that key blade, bro?
01:39:22 Like what's the sign-up bonus like on that key chain?
01:39:26 Big card blade.
01:39:27 Dude, I'm churning chains, bro.
01:39:30 I'm chaining memories, bro.
01:39:32 And ironically, like a giant credit card
01:39:34 would make more sense as a blade than a key.
01:39:36 That would be sick, though.
01:39:38 It's time for me, it's time for me
01:39:40 to start workshopping my new manga series,
01:39:43 which is a shonen action about people battling
01:39:45 with giant credit cards and comparing,
01:39:47 like, who can get the best bargains?
01:39:49 Yo!
01:39:50 Who can do the best combos to get the most cashback
01:39:53 on their purchase, on their Christmas gift shopping?
01:39:56 Oh my god.
01:39:57 Yeah, money equates to power in that shonen universe.
01:39:59 Yo, when is this gonna come out?
01:40:00 Just like, just like, just like the conclusion,
01:40:04 just like the conclusion to Road to Radcon.
01:40:07 Literally, that's the final beat of Road to Radcon.
01:40:10 Not spoiler, I won't go in any more detail.
01:40:13 Literally, just like the dramatic conclusion
01:40:16 of Road to Radcon.
01:40:18 Check my pinned tweet on Twitter, it's also ugly.
01:40:21 Buy a copy, please.
01:40:22 I have 55 copies left in a box.
01:40:25 Please buy them from me, please.
01:40:27 We're gonna buy them, I'll get rid of them.
01:40:29 We're gonna buy them.
01:40:32 If you check my Twitter, like I said,
01:40:34 my pinned tweet on Twitter, it's also ugly,
01:40:38 has buying instructions.
01:40:40 It basically just tells you how much money it is
01:40:43 and where to pay pallet to me.
01:40:46 And then you can just DM me on Twitter
01:40:47 and I will say, okay, I will send it to you.
01:40:50 I'm doing this very DIY, like out the fucking back
01:40:53 of my car kind of thing.
01:40:55 I'll buy one and everyone who's listening
01:40:58 should buy one too.
01:40:59 No matter how many are left, everyone should buy one.
01:41:03 Everyone should just cop a quick one,
01:41:05 even if you already have one, you know?
01:41:06 Please, I have to move product.
01:41:08 I paid for these books out of my own pocket.
01:41:11 Help me.
01:41:12 You know what I say, having two of everything
01:41:13 doesn't hurt, you know?
01:41:16 Buy two, I would highly recommend buying two copies.
01:41:18 So you can do a wheel.
01:41:19 Maybe buy three.
01:41:20 You can put one, you can buy two
01:41:22 and then you could put one, like leave it mint.
01:41:25 So for future generations, you could sell it at a markup.
01:41:29 It's like a physical NFT.
01:41:31 I was horrified.
01:41:34 I came in, it was raining so hard yesterday.
01:41:37 It was pouring.
01:41:38 I was walking home with my umbrella.
01:41:40 My legs got soaked, but I was walking home
01:41:45 and I walked in my house and I closed my umbrella,
01:41:48 but I shook my umbrella out and it threw water droplets
01:41:52 all over my room and I realized to my horror
01:41:55 that several droplets of water had fallen into the open box
01:41:59 where the copies of Road to Radcon lie fallow,
01:42:02 waiting, just waiting to be given a good home.
01:42:05 And I was like, no, water damage.
01:42:07 And I pulled out the two top copies
01:42:09 that were sitting on top and I brushed them off
01:42:11 and I tried, I dried them and I was like, no, no.
01:42:13 They're gonna pockmark the cover.
01:42:15 They're gonna get little divots on them.
01:42:17 And it looked like it was true.
01:42:18 It looked like they had swelled up a little bit.
01:42:20 I was like, no, now I can't sell these.
01:42:21 Now I'll have to give these away as business gifts
01:42:25 to idiots that I find.
01:42:27 But then I left them, I have to give these to homeless people
01:42:31 on the street to wipe their asses with this.
01:42:34 But I just put them down and I let them dry off
01:42:38 and I checked them about an hour later
01:42:40 and they had dried off and they were no longer,
01:42:42 they had unswelled, they were no longer
01:42:44 noticeably damaged at all.
01:42:45 So I was like, few, saved.
01:42:48 Well, thank God, I don't want to get to homeless people now.
01:42:50 Oh, God, that was almost bad.
01:42:53 So back in the box.
01:42:54 And they're yearning for it.
01:42:56 They think, well, they better pay up then.
01:42:59 They don't, you don't understand.
01:43:00 These books ain't cheap, kid.
01:43:01 You don't understand how much homeless people
01:43:02 love the PCP podcast.
01:43:05 It's like a cultural icon.
01:43:06 They're our target demographic.
01:43:08 Yeah, target demographic.
01:43:10 We're aspirational to them.
01:43:11 They love it, but they can't access it
01:43:13 because their phone ran out of battery.
01:43:14 Every time that they listen to it,
01:43:17 they're just imagining what it would be like.
01:43:20 It's homeless people with dead batteries
01:43:23 who haven't checked the podcast in a year
01:43:25 coming back in the comments.
01:43:27 It's that one or two guys in the comments
01:43:29 every time being like,
01:43:31 just checking back to see if Nate's on the podcast again.
01:43:33 Like it's because they've been living
01:43:35 on the street this whole time
01:43:36 and they haven't found a starbucks to plug their phone into.
01:43:39 They have to go to a public library
01:43:40 to check in on you guys over a few months, you know?
01:43:43 That's right, that's right.
01:43:45 You should do a book signing at homeless shelters.
01:43:48 Would it be controversial to bring up Nate's new show?
01:43:53 Gamer's Zone?
01:43:53 No, we mentioned it.
01:43:56 You mean the Gamer's Zone?
01:43:57 Yeah.
01:43:59 It's not that new.
01:43:59 Okay, Worst PCP.
01:44:03 I have actually listened to like a full one.
01:44:05 I glanced at it, I skipped around.
01:44:07 I was like, okay, yeah, they're talking about
01:44:09 like hot button issues of, or maybe they aren't.
01:44:12 Well, okay, goodbye.
01:44:15 It wasn't that.
01:44:16 It was kind of like a PCP.
01:44:17 I assume they talk about video games.
01:44:19 I assume it's, I mean, it's like the PCP
01:44:22 and that it's a people talking
01:44:23 and one of the members is the same.
01:44:26 Yeah, exactly.
01:44:27 Is it real?
01:44:27 Yeah, I mean, I guess, what else?
01:44:29 I mean, we invented that concept.
01:44:32 Absolutely, we invented podcasts as a concept.
01:44:34 Well, I mean, wasn't the concept behind the PCP,
01:44:38 Nate's gonna get his friends together to run a show
01:44:40 and now Nate's getting his friends together
01:44:42 to run a new show?
01:44:44 No.
01:44:45 What are you talking about?
01:44:46 The concept behind the PCP was Nate's gonna get his friends.
01:44:49 Like what, where do you get that idea?
01:44:51 I have seen that idea.
01:44:52 That's a little genuinely offensive in the same way
01:44:56 that like, oh, PCP podcast is Digi Bro's anime podcast,
01:45:00 but actually worse.
01:45:01 Listen, I've heard that take so many times
01:45:04 in just the general PCP community.
01:45:06 I mean, I didn't do research, I didn't fight it.
01:45:09 I've just seen a lot of people say it.
01:45:10 I have never heard that and I, and they,
01:45:14 and I whoever thinks that better be glad
01:45:16 I never heard them say that shit before.
01:45:19 Let it deranged, literally deranged.
01:45:24 What were we talking about?
01:45:26 He's gonna track down the homeless people.
01:45:28 Oh yeah.
01:45:29 That's claimed though.
01:45:30 Oh yeah, I have more pizza things to read.
01:45:34 This is in the Mickey Mouse voice.
01:45:38 Say, fellas, did somebody mention the door to Domino's?
01:45:43 That's actually a pretty good Mickey voice.
01:45:45 Say, fellas, did someone mention the two for one special?
01:45:49 It sounds like a South Park version of Mickey.
01:45:52 Actually, it's a pretty solid Mickey impression.
01:45:54 It's better than I could do.
01:45:58 Geez, it's been Mickey Mouse.
01:46:00 Oh, wow.
01:46:02 We gotta kill the darkness or whatever, Sora.
01:46:08 I have another thing that happened this week.
01:46:15 You guys know the Drawcast podcast?
01:46:17 Yeah.
01:46:19 Yeah, not ours, the new one.
01:46:23 The one with the C-Tool in them, right?
01:46:25 Oblivionful. Yeah.
01:46:27 What did you say, Pyro?
01:46:29 I said the one with C-Tool, Oblivion,
01:46:31 and I think Teleparte is on a few.
01:46:33 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
01:46:36 Well, I'm on a one that is coming up soon.
01:46:40 It's the draw, it's Telephone.
01:46:43 The idea being like there's a prompt
01:46:46 and then someone draws it
01:46:47 and then they show their drawing
01:46:50 to the next person for like a minute
01:46:52 and that person has to try to like remember it
01:46:54 and then like recreate it
01:46:55 and then they show it to the next person for a minute
01:46:57 and they have to remember it and try to re...
01:46:59 Yeah, yeah, like the game, Telephone.
01:47:01 Yeah, Drawcast Telephone.
01:47:04 So I had mine, I had my turn this week
01:47:09 and the next person after me in line was Teleparte.
01:47:13 So I had to get in a call with him
01:47:15 and show him the, you know, my thing for him to copy.
01:47:20 And it was very annoying
01:47:22 because my Discord stream like fucked up.
01:47:27 Like I put two minutes on the, okay, well, first.
01:47:33 First, he asked me like, hey, when can we do it?
01:47:36 And I was like, we can do it this afternoon,
01:47:37 I'll be around.
01:47:38 And then a like emergency situation
01:47:40 with my landlord came up
01:47:42 and I suddenly had to like run to the bank to pay rent
01:47:47 and then run to the post office to send rent.
01:47:50 So that was, by the way, by the way, side note,
01:47:55 my landlord is attempting to ask me to pay a late fee
01:48:00 on rent, which is illegal in Massachusetts.
01:48:04 It is illegal to ask your tenant to pay a late fee
01:48:08 on rent that is less than 30 days late.
01:48:10 And I was not 30 days late.
01:48:12 So she is simply breaking the law.
01:48:15 And if she asks me again, we may have to go to court over it.
01:48:19 And I will win because the law is unambiguous.
01:48:22 But so that's fun.
01:48:23 So my shitty landlord is fucking,
01:48:25 is fucking trying to do crimes against me.
01:48:30 So I'm out, so I had to run to the bank and all that.
01:48:32 And then I see on my phone that like Teleparte an hour ago
01:48:35 was like, hey, you're ready to do it?
01:48:38 Hey, let me know when you're ready.
01:48:40 Get back to me, whatever you see this.
01:48:42 And I'm like, shit, fuck, I said I would be around.
01:48:45 So I tell him like, oops, sorry, landlord emergency.
01:48:48 And then I come back and I'm like, okay,
01:48:50 it's like two hours later, but I'm like, okay, I'm ready.
01:48:52 And then I get on the thing and I open up my stream
01:48:56 and I show it to him and my stream is like fucking up.
01:48:58 I'm like sharing the window that my drawing is in.
01:49:01 And it's all like, it's like glitching and jerking
01:49:03 and like flashing around.
01:49:04 And I'm like, I don't know why it's doing that.
01:49:08 So I have to like stop that, stop sharing that
01:49:11 and then just start sharing my whole screen,
01:49:13 which partly shows the image.
01:49:15 And it's doing that thing where like,
01:49:18 you move your cursor around
01:49:19 and like it remembers where your cursor was been
01:49:21 and like the cursor stays on the screen,
01:49:23 like flashing and like a trail.
01:49:25 Yeah, it's doing that.
01:49:27 And I don't know why, I'm just telling it share my screen.
01:49:31 So, and this is like, I have two minutes,
01:49:33 he has two minutes to look at the thing
01:49:35 and it's all like glitching out and flashing around
01:49:38 and like the cursor is fucking up
01:49:40 and like marring the image.
01:49:41 I'm sure it was very distracting.
01:49:44 So that was kind of a shit show, but whatever.
01:49:47 I mean, two whole minutes,
01:49:49 how long does it take to fucking look at a thing
01:49:51 and know what it looks like?
01:49:52 So I'm sure it was fine.
01:49:54 Are shows like that difficult?
01:49:57 Two whole minutes to try to remember.
01:49:58 I would assume that'd be really difficult, right?
01:50:03 You were allowed to like take notes.
01:50:06 You're not allowed to like sketch it,
01:50:07 but you were allowed to like take notes
01:50:09 in that two minutes about what it looks like.
01:50:11 For me, it was pretty, you weren't on that.
01:50:14 Oh wait, nice.
01:50:15 I was, I was earlier in the train.
01:50:17 No, you were, you were, I saw your drawing.
01:50:20 Well, the person that called me on the discord
01:50:25 and said, hey, it's your turn to look at mine,
01:50:27 that person told me explicitly, you are allowed to take notes.
01:50:30 Okay, I guess at some point somebody decided,
01:50:34 Oh, can I take notes?
01:50:35 And someone was like, yeah, I guess so.
01:50:36 Even the rules, even the rules of telephone
01:50:39 are like changed like in between.
01:50:41 They're getting telephoned.
01:50:42 Yeah, they are getting telephoned.
01:50:44 That's kind of funny.
01:50:46 Lamal.
01:50:47 So it's not, okay.
01:50:49 Okay, that makes a lot more sense that you can take notes
01:50:52 because I'm not an artist at all.
01:50:55 But if I had to do that,
01:50:56 I would probably be stressing out about the little like.
01:50:59 I kind of think.
01:51:00 I think it wasn't that bad.
01:51:02 I think two minutes was too long.
01:51:04 I think two minutes is too long.
01:51:06 I had one minute and I think it was, it was like, yeah.
01:51:11 Why did they change the rules?
01:51:12 It did telephone.
01:51:13 Don't worry about it.
01:51:14 I had like one minute and I was looking at it.
01:51:19 I'm like, okay, humanoid with this, that,
01:51:23 what color is the hair?
01:51:23 What color is the thing?
01:51:25 What color is that?
01:51:27 Oh wait, no, I didn't have color
01:51:28 because the person who went before me
01:51:30 did theirs in black and white.
01:51:32 Yeah.
01:51:33 So I had to come up with colors.
01:51:35 They told me what the colors were,
01:51:36 but they didn't tell me where they were.
01:51:38 So my-
01:51:39 I feel like that's cheating.
01:51:40 I feel like that's cheating that they told you that.
01:51:44 I mean, I move the colors into various places.
01:51:48 Tell a perte, look, I mean, I'm not trying to judge,
01:51:52 but like that's definitely cheating
01:51:54 for you to ask for like additional information
01:51:56 than what's in the drawing.
01:51:59 I mean, that's what oblivion is for.
01:52:00 It's obviously, like it's definitely not
01:52:04 in the spirit of the game to be like,
01:52:06 hey, tell me more about the images.
01:52:07 I didn't ask for information.
01:52:09 They just said, oh, like, oh, whoops,
01:52:11 I drew in black and white.
01:52:12 What should I do?
01:52:12 An oblivion fool said, oh, you can just tell them
01:52:14 the general colors.
01:52:17 Stupid.
01:52:18 Well, I looked, okay, the person that went before me,
01:52:23 I looked at all the images in the chain,
01:52:25 and the person that went before me
01:52:27 took some weird liberties with it
01:52:30 in a way that I found kind of annoying.
01:52:32 Like, it seemed like they like sort of deliberately
01:52:34 tried to differentiate themselves
01:52:36 by just like adding a bunch of shit.
01:52:39 Wait, Ben, did you look at all
01:52:40 of the different ones previously?
01:52:43 Well, no, after I finished mine,
01:52:45 I went back and I looked at them.
01:52:46 Oh, after, yeah, I guess that's fair.
01:52:48 That's fine.
01:52:49 Yeah, the person before me, I don't know,
01:52:53 they like, you know, they drew the figure,
01:52:57 they tried to recreate the figure,
01:52:58 but like, they put it like floating in a void.
01:53:01 They put it like underwater, which was like,
01:53:04 Like what was the thing you were supposed to draw?
01:53:05 It was a girl.
01:53:07 It was a girl, well, it doesn't matter.
01:53:11 It's a particular character.
01:53:12 But the point is, so this person who went before me
01:53:15 decided, you know, they looked at a picture
01:53:18 of this person, you know, just kind of standing there,
01:53:20 and decided that for their iteration of telephone,
01:53:23 they were going to draw them like floating underwater,
01:53:26 which is like, I don't know,
01:53:30 that doesn't seem right to me.
01:53:31 That seems like they are deliberately adding things
01:53:35 and changing it.
01:53:36 That isn't the spirit of the game
01:53:38 that you were supposed to attempt to recreate
01:53:41 the image that you were shown.
01:53:42 And the changes are merely from like,
01:53:46 your lack of remembering your,
01:53:50 Yeah, you can't replicate it perfectly, so.
01:53:52 Yes, yes, so I thought that was annoying.
01:53:57 But yeah.
01:53:58 I'm gonna be a wild card.
01:53:59 Teleperte, yeah, it's a little bit like,
01:54:02 ooh, I'm gonna be a little different though,
01:54:04 like, ooh, mine's a little,
01:54:06 I'm gonna fuck this up on purpose a little bit,
01:54:08 like, mm, just so that I stand out.
01:54:13 The, yeah, Teleperte was, he was like kind of mumbling.
01:54:18 He said like, he was asking me like,
01:54:19 oh, so what is this?
01:54:20 Is this like a such and such?
01:54:22 Is this a so and so?
01:54:23 And I said like, mm, I don't think I should opine
01:54:26 on what it is.
01:54:27 I don't think I should say anything
01:54:29 about what I was trying to draw.
01:54:31 I just think I should just let the image speak for itself.
01:54:35 He also, he said he liked it.
01:54:36 He said he was very complimentary of me,
01:54:39 so that was pretty cool.
01:54:40 Yeah.
01:54:43 That's it, that's my story.
01:54:45 Wait, so.
01:54:46 It was a great fun.
01:54:47 What's this?
01:54:49 Sorry, I'm so out of the loop with all this stuff,
01:54:51 but what's, what is this?
01:54:53 Like, what is this channel on?
01:54:55 I'm gonna kick, I'm gonna kick your ass.
01:54:56 I'm gonna fucking kick your ass, dude.
01:54:58 What channel is it?
01:55:00 Like what, the channel is just called DrawCast.
01:55:04 Yeah.
01:55:04 DrawCast is.
01:55:05 They stole the name from us.
01:55:07 They stole the name, because we were.
01:55:09 And the format.
01:55:10 We didn't protect our copyright.
01:55:11 We didn't strike them down.
01:55:12 You should, 100%.
01:55:14 No.
01:55:14 They're squatting on our I.C. wall.
01:55:17 Give them a copyright strike.
01:55:21 I should give them a fucking.
01:55:23 DMCA here.
01:55:24 He didn't get my stern talking to, I think we should.
01:55:27 Yeah.
01:55:28 I'm a very faintly bullet.
01:55:30 Is that what you said?
01:55:31 Bullet.
01:55:32 Yeah, I should give them a bullet.
01:55:33 Oh my God.
01:55:34 That's what, that's a normal thing
01:55:35 that people say, right?
01:55:36 Oh yeah, I know, yeah.
01:55:37 Yeah.
01:55:38 Yeah.
01:55:39 Good.
01:55:40 Oh, yeah, speaking of the DrawCast,
01:55:42 the Halloween one that I was on
01:55:46 has just released as of recording.
01:55:48 And that is where I invented
01:55:51 the scraggity-agity, the scarecrow.
01:55:54 It was like a, like, oh, draw a scarecrow character.
01:55:59 Wait, no, that was completely different.
01:56:02 That's completely different.
01:56:03 I'm thinking of a different DrawCast
01:56:05 on a different thing that is not related.
01:56:09 Well, I was on that DrawCast that is on the DrawCast.
01:56:12 The Halloween DrawCast right now
01:56:15 is not where I invented scraggity-agity.
01:56:17 That was the big booby-mummy-milker's
01:56:19 Halloween DrawCast that was out.
01:56:23 You've lost, you've lost your mind.
01:56:24 You've lost touch with reality.
01:56:26 It's confusing, because there's two different
01:56:28 DrawCasts Halloween-themed,
01:56:29 where I, one in which I invented a cool OC
01:56:32 and the other one in which I drew punk
01:56:35 and some other things.
01:56:37 Hmm, I can see how that would be confusing.
01:56:40 Are you talking about big, bitty scream?
01:56:44 Huh?
01:56:45 Like, in the thumbnail for the DrawCast,
01:56:47 it's just like scream, but with big bitties.
01:56:51 Oh, yeah, scream, but boob-boob-boobs, yeah.
01:56:53 Oh, right, yeah, that's a Oblivion Falls drawing.
01:56:56 I think.
01:56:57 I think.
01:56:59 Yes, that's the one I'm talking about.
01:57:03 Go watch it, link in description.
01:57:07 Ugh!
01:57:10 Wait, I have one other thing on my list
01:57:13 of things to talk about this week.
01:57:16 Crypto gas.
01:57:19 This week I discovered that crypto is, in fact, a scam.
01:57:23 It's bullshit, it will never take off.
01:57:24 Discover?
01:57:25 No one will ever use it.
01:57:26 Well, I already kinda knew,
01:57:28 but I was reaffirmed to me, like, this is dog shit
01:57:31 and it's simply nonsense and it doesn't make any fucking sense.
01:57:34 I was, I had, okay, last year,
01:57:38 I had been watching a financial advice channel
01:57:42 called Clear Value Tax, just for financial advice.
01:57:47 And the guy at one point, he mentioned an app called KuCoin
01:57:50 and he said he uses KuCoin and he said it,
01:57:54 do you know what this is?
01:57:54 I don't know what KuCoin is, yeah.
01:57:56 What, KuCoin is?
01:57:57 Really?
01:57:58 C-O-U coin?
01:57:59 No, K-U, K-U coin.
01:58:01 Oh, okay, okay.
01:58:02 So it's an app that you can buy crypto on it
01:58:05 and then you can invest in crypto,
01:58:08 but you can also do things like take your crypto
01:58:10 and you can put your crypto into trading bots
01:58:15 that will make trades for you
01:58:17 and it's a low-risk way of quote-unquote investing.
01:58:22 It's sort of like a different investing method.
01:58:23 It's like investment firms but bots.
01:58:29 Yeah, something like that.
01:58:30 So I tried it just to see what,
01:58:32 I put a couple hundred dollars in it
01:58:35 just to see what would happen.
01:58:37 I put it into a few different currency
01:58:38 and I tried running some bots.
01:58:39 It did actually make some returns
01:58:42 but it was so effort intensive.
01:58:45 I had to be doing work on it every day
01:58:48 to be making these returns and I was like,
01:58:52 this is kinda, I'm not sticking with it, I don't think.
01:58:55 So I left it alone for a while
01:58:57 and then recently I'm not using that shit anymore.
01:59:00 I just wanna pull the money out.
01:59:01 So it was a nightmare to pull it out
01:59:03 because you can't just directly withdraw your money
01:59:07 from KuCoin.
01:59:09 You have to send it to a wallet.
01:59:12 I still have, you have to send it to a wallet
01:59:15 and then depending on the wallet,
01:59:17 you can maybe withdraw through that.
01:59:20 So what I should have done was just,
01:59:23 so I had to create a wallet
01:59:25 and then what I should have done
01:59:26 was send it to my Coinbase wallet
01:59:33 and then I could have maybe withdrawn it through Coinbase.
01:59:36 But instead Coinbase told me,
01:59:38 don't send it to Coinbase, use our app
01:59:41 which is called Coinbase Wallet.
01:59:43 Not the same as just a wallet on Coinbase.
01:59:45 Coinbase Wallet is a separate wallet.
01:59:48 So I sent it to Coinbase Wallet
01:59:51 and I also cannot withdraw it from Coinbase Wallet
01:59:54 and I'm like, okay, great.
01:59:56 I had to pay a fee for all three kinds of,
01:59:58 I had USD, UST and Bitcoin
02:00:01 and I had to pay $30 for each transfer
02:00:05 from each of those currencies to the wallet.
02:00:07 I'm like, okay, great.
02:00:09 And so now I have it in the wallet
02:00:12 and now I'm like, I wanna withdraw and I can't.
02:00:14 And I'm like, it's like, okay, no, no, no, to withdraw,
02:00:17 you have to send it from Coinbase Wallet
02:00:20 to the wallet on Coinbase.
02:00:22 And I'm like, all right, fine.
02:00:25 And so I tried to do that
02:00:26 and the Bitcoin transfer is easy,
02:00:29 but the USD and the UST both tell me
02:00:32 that it will be $100 to transfer like $70 worth of it
02:00:39 from Coinbase Wallet to Coinbase, the same website.
02:00:46 And I'm like, are you joking me?
02:00:48 And it turns out, and I complained about this on Twitter
02:00:51 and a couple people told me like, no, no, that's normal.
02:00:54 No, no, that's normal, that's gas.
02:00:56 That's what we call the gas fee.
02:00:58 It like pays for like the Ethereum blockchain mining
02:01:02 or something.
02:01:05 I'm like, oh, great.
02:01:06 Yeah, this is gonna take,
02:01:07 this is gonna take off for sure.
02:01:09 Yeah, everybody's gonna be doing this.
02:01:10 Everybody's gonna be paying for everything.
02:01:13 Paying like a hundred fucking dollars
02:01:15 to send less than a hundred dollars between wallets.
02:01:20 Like, oh, I'm glad we fucking have a decentralized currency
02:01:24 that everybody's gonna be using soon.
02:01:26 Get on this shit while it's hot.
02:01:28 So, I don't know, fucking...
02:01:31 Apparently if I wait, like the price fluctuates
02:01:35 and I might be able to find a day
02:01:36 where it maybe only costs me like $30 to send my $70
02:01:43 to my wallet that I can actually,
02:01:44 so like, I made modest returns on the money
02:01:47 that I put into KuCoin.
02:01:49 It has, all of that has been destroyed.
02:01:52 All of that has been taken and much more
02:01:55 simply by the act of me trying to get my money back out.
02:01:59 So, total dog shit, a complete scam,
02:02:03 a big pyramid scheme, and a few people get rich
02:02:06 and it is designed so that everybody else loses money
02:02:09 and pays into the system
02:02:10 and just doesn't get anything out of it.
02:02:15 It's for idiots, it's for idiots.
02:02:16 There's very few cryptocurrencies
02:02:18 that are actually worth investing in
02:02:22 and the ones that are are now like...
02:02:24 The only ones that, including the gas fee
02:02:27 that you can get actual profit on
02:02:30 are so expensive that it's not even worth your time.
02:02:35 It's...
02:02:37 I mean, I would have...
02:02:38 I mean, if I'd bought a bunch of Bitcoin a year ago,
02:02:41 it sure would be more valuable now.
02:02:43 The number sure did go up.
02:02:45 Like, investing in small cryptocurrency now,
02:02:49 especially when a lot of them don't have an audience.
02:02:53 Yeah, fucking...
02:02:54 Crypto idiots are always saying like,
02:02:56 oh, I invested in some new shit coins,
02:02:59 some new fucking coin.
02:03:01 Oh, did you see this one new coin?
02:03:03 Oh, it went from like a penny to like $100 overnight.
02:03:06 Oh, I could have made a million dollars.
02:03:07 Yeah, I...
02:03:08 Like, and all this stupid crap
02:03:11 is always happening all the time.
02:03:12 Some stupid new thing is always every week.
02:03:15 Some new shill is like, I have a new coin,
02:03:17 invested in my new coin.
02:03:18 They're all the same, they're all a scam.
02:03:20 They're all just, they're all a pyramid scheme
02:03:22 where the guy who makes it is gonna take the money and run.
02:03:26 And that's it.
02:03:27 That's all there is to it.
02:03:28 NFTs are so much worse though, like honestly.
02:03:32 NFTs are, I mean, they're all...
02:03:35 I guess they probably are worse.
02:03:37 They probably are worse.
02:03:38 Just like the amount of like,
02:03:39 hypebeasts and shills that there are.
02:03:41 Like, every single influencer has like an NFT
02:03:45 that they like support holds hardly
02:03:47 and it's like their profile picture on Twitter
02:03:51 and all that stuff and it's like, shut the fuck up.
02:03:53 Yeah.
02:03:54 All a scam, obviously.
02:03:56 All like a pump and dump,
02:03:58 like get people hype for this thing,
02:04:01 convince them it's gonna be worth a bunch of money,
02:04:03 get them to buy in and then cut and disappear.
02:04:05 That's why I'm so surprised whenever people believe
02:04:08 what influencers say on like, crypto.
02:04:12 It seems like such like a not,
02:04:14 you know, something you should never do.
02:04:17 I was reading Dan Olson's thread.
02:04:20 Dan Olson has a big thread on Twitter
02:04:22 where he was like, he was accepting invites
02:04:26 and do all kinds of like crypto discord servers
02:04:29 and just documenting them.
02:04:31 He has made a big spreadsheet documenting
02:04:33 like how they all were behaving and like,
02:04:37 it's all a bunch of like,
02:04:41 his story is that like, every one of these communities
02:04:44 is a bunch of people who sort of like,
02:04:46 pretend that they're there for a community.
02:04:49 But they're all actually just obviously there
02:04:51 because they think they can flip and make a profit
02:04:54 and they're all like delusional about it.
02:04:56 Like even after like the people that make it like,
02:04:59 cut and run and disappear from the server
02:05:01 and are obviously never coming back,
02:05:02 everybody kind of is just like, nah, we just gotta hold.
02:05:05 You know, this is just a temporary setback.
02:05:07 You know, this is all gonna be worth a lot of money one day,
02:05:10 but that's always the same.
02:05:11 Everyone's just massive characters in this entire thing.
02:05:14 Like in this entire like cryptocurrency.
02:05:16 Yeah, I actually, I feel a little cheated.
02:05:20 There was a YouTuber that launched Cluecoin,
02:05:23 COU coin, right?
02:05:26 CLU?
02:05:27 And I bought it, I bought it like the third hour was out.
02:05:30 So like I was one of the first investors.
02:05:33 I put $500 into it.
02:05:38 That $500 is now worth 14.
02:05:42 You know, yeah, like I know, obviously, obviously,
02:05:48 some people, there are some stories of people
02:05:51 who through some chance or maybe either through
02:05:57 the fact that like it was their plan all along
02:05:59 or through maybe through some random chance
02:06:01 made a bunch of money investing in crypto.
02:06:04 There are some sort of, but like, you know,
02:06:06 like the vast majority of people, you know,
02:06:08 for a few people to be getting rich off of this shit,
02:06:11 everybody else has to be losing money.
02:06:13 So most people are gonna end up exactly like that.
02:06:19 Ooh, I hates it, I hates it.
02:06:22 I mean, at least the good thing about NFTs is that when-
02:06:26 Is that it supports art?
02:06:28 No, it's that when somebody fucks up
02:06:30 and loses all their money and they go bankrupt,
02:06:33 they have a really funny image.
02:06:35 That it's like, it's funny to,
02:06:38 it's something to point and laugh at.
02:06:40 Crypto bros, like a text tweet of them being like,
02:06:44 oh no, I lost all my money is less funny
02:06:47 than a funny, like weird, gross looking ape saying
02:06:50 I lost all my money.
02:06:51 Did that have you like the only like copy
02:06:53 of Charlie bit my finger?
02:07:00 Instead of the fucking crypto shit,
02:07:02 NFT shit is a fucking nightmare, we can see live in hell.
02:07:05 Genuinely, like I thought,
02:07:07 man, I thought 2020 was bad.
02:07:09 I thought fucking coronavirus was bad
02:07:10 and was never going away,
02:07:12 but now NFTs are here and everybody's doing them.
02:07:16 And it seems like they're becoming,
02:07:17 like fucking Ubisoft is putting NFTs in their games,
02:07:20 they're gonna, they said they're gonna do.
02:07:22 This Adobe Photoshop is allowing you to make NFTs
02:07:25 from Photoshop.
02:07:26 Really?
02:07:27 Really?
02:07:28 Have you seen that?
02:07:29 The building functionality into Photoshop
02:07:31 so that you can like save as NFT.
02:07:33 Just fucking kill me already.
02:07:35 Just fucking end it.
02:07:36 I mean, that is kind of big brain on Adobe's part though.
02:07:41 Like it makes sense.
02:07:43 Well, I guess it makes sense.
02:07:44 Getting money from it,
02:07:45 I guess people will have to get Photoshop for it.
02:07:48 Yeah, I just like easier access,
02:07:50 but still that's like, it's just so brain dead.
02:07:54 But it's so weird,
02:07:55 because it was like from every conceivable angle,
02:07:59 it's stupid and yet everybody's getting on it.
02:08:03 I don't really understand.
02:08:04 I guess people just aren't aware,
02:08:06 but they aren't critical for some reason.
02:08:09 They're just going around just assuming it's perfect.
02:08:12 No, it's not that.
02:08:13 It's literally just dwarfish gold madness.
02:08:15 It's literally just people here
02:08:17 that somebody made a lot of money
02:08:18 and they're like, I also wanna make a lot of money.
02:08:21 Oh, you did a thing called NFT?
02:08:23 Well, whatever.
02:08:23 I don't care what it is, I'll do it.
02:08:26 Like that's what it is.
02:08:28 Nobody actually believes that like NFTs are like good.
02:08:32 They just think they can make a lot of money.
02:08:33 It's the hot new thing.
02:08:34 And they're just uncritically going along with it.
02:08:37 Especially for a lot of celebrities as well.
02:08:39 Especially for like how badly it fucks up the environment.
02:08:42 Put that cringe.
02:08:45 Yeah.
02:08:46 I'm just surprised that people are still like,
02:08:49 like it doesn't make as much money as people would think
02:08:51 and it fucks up the environment.
02:08:52 So I don't see like the...
02:08:55 Well, see, okay.
02:08:57 NFTs are weird because they don't have any actual use.
02:09:02 They are literally the only reason anybody gives a shit.
02:09:06 Any of the NFT bros, they always say the same thing
02:09:09 because it's a way to make money.
02:09:11 That's it.
02:09:12 That's all they see.
02:09:13 Yeah, that's all they see.
02:09:14 They see a dollar sign.
02:09:16 There is no functional use.
02:09:17 There is no reason to give a shit about NFTs
02:09:20 other than, ooh, what if I make money?
02:09:23 Yeah.
02:09:24 It's the equivalent of like participating in a fad.
02:09:27 Like, oh, planking.
02:09:29 I'll do a plank.
02:09:31 No, it's not like that.
02:09:32 If it makes me money.
02:09:34 Yeah, it's like if planking was like...
02:09:36 Well, the thing with planking is like, oh, it's funny
02:09:38 and it's fun being part of whatever's going on.
02:09:41 Replace that with, it's nice to get some cash
02:09:45 and then that's why everyone's saying it.
02:09:46 The reason why crypto bros are so cringy
02:09:49 is because they are operating under,
02:09:52 like they literally don't care about what they're saying.
02:09:55 They're saying whatever they think they need to say
02:09:58 in order to like, to hype their brand up
02:10:00 and like, you know, maintain the brand
02:10:05 and like help their fucking items like cost rise
02:10:09 so they can flip it at a profit.
02:10:11 They're not saying anything
02:10:12 because they actually believe it or like think it's cool.
02:10:15 They're saying what they think they need to do
02:10:17 just like serve their financial needs.
02:10:19 I got this like Black Mirror episode.
02:10:21 It's a crypto bro dad gets his son an NFT for Christmas.
02:10:26 That's not a Black Mirror.
02:10:28 It's just like, it's just...
02:10:28 That would be such a good episode actually.
02:10:31 You know, I forget what the legal term is called
02:10:34 but they have this issue in baseball for baseball cards
02:10:37 and there's still a lot of places with this issue
02:10:40 where somebody would open a store, right?
02:10:44 They'd have a pretty rare baseball card.
02:10:47 It's not worth anything.
02:10:49 They put a sign out or they have somebody come in,
02:10:52 you know, they give this person money to come in
02:10:54 and buy the card at $100,000.
02:10:57 So that way they could say this card sold for $100,000.
02:11:00 It really did.
02:11:01 This person just bought it.
02:11:03 You know, right now I'll sell it to you half off $50,000.
02:11:06 And you know, some poor person will walk in,
02:11:09 not poor as in money wise, but just poor as in this is sad.
02:11:12 They'll walk in and they'll see that and say,
02:11:14 oh, I could flip it at 100K and then they buy it.
02:11:17 And then this person will now defend the shop.
02:11:20 They'll say, no, no, no, this shop is legit.
02:11:23 I bought this for 50K.
02:11:24 I got it half off.
02:11:25 I can still sell it for 100K.
02:11:27 I swear the shop, you know, they defend the practice
02:11:30 because, you know, sunk cost fallacy, I honestly.
02:11:33 It's the, it reminds me of like, you know,
02:11:38 that in that HBomber guy had that video
02:11:40 about the anti-vax stuff and it's those people who,
02:11:44 it's like the most vociferous defenders
02:11:48 of like the anti-vax guy, that one guy
02:11:52 who like wrote the book and like is sort of
02:11:54 the starter of the whole thing.
02:11:55 It's like, those are like the people
02:11:56 that like were victimized the most by him.
02:11:59 Who like, like the people who have like lost the most
02:12:03 to the whole thing are like the ones that are most invested
02:12:06 in like convincing themselves that like it was not a scam
02:12:09 and it was not all for nothing.
02:12:10 Yeah, and I mean, I'm not saying all NFT trading websites
02:12:14 are like this.
02:12:15 I have a feeling most are, but I've definitely heard stories
02:12:19 of, you know, somebody seeing a piece,
02:12:22 cause you know, it's all anonymous with, you know,
02:12:25 Ethereum, you know, you see it go to wallets,
02:12:27 but you don't know who's who.
02:12:29 So you'll see something listed starting at like 10 Ethereum,
02:12:32 which is a lot of money.
02:12:34 And then, you know, somebody buys it,
02:12:36 but it could just be the same person, you know,
02:12:39 making a new wallet to make it and just transferring
02:12:41 their Ethereum from wallet to wallet, basically,
02:12:43 and then selling it for eight and then it sells.
02:12:47 Like there is a lot of that.
02:12:48 People get scammed every day with NFTs.
02:12:50 And I think that's the biggest issue of it.
02:12:53 It's just, you know, it's easy to scam people.
02:12:56 It's too easy.
02:12:59 Have you guys seen that?
02:13:00 Oh, look at it.
02:13:01 What's up?
02:13:02 Mm-hmm.
02:13:03 I understand I'm looking at Bitcoin.
02:13:04 Bitcoin is down slightly, but it's still just kind of
02:13:08 hanging out.
02:13:09 Ben, you can't keep paying attention to it now.
02:13:11 And yet, and yet I just did and there's nothing
02:13:14 you can do about it.
02:13:15 Well, isn't that, surely exposing yourself to it
02:13:21 continually will allow you to slip in and be like,
02:13:24 but maybe I could make some big cash.
02:13:27 Don't worry, I can fix them.
02:13:28 Like go back in.
02:13:29 I can change them.
02:13:30 I don't think so.
02:13:31 I really don't think I'm gonna buy at this point.
02:13:37 I really think I've basically missed out
02:13:39 on like the big gains.
02:13:40 If there are any more gains to be made,
02:13:44 I think I've missed out on the majority of them already.
02:13:46 I'm not really thinking of buying at the moment.
02:13:49 Right, clip that.
02:13:50 Don't worry.
02:13:51 Then repost it whenever it happens.
02:13:53 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:13:55 Clip that and then use it against me later.
02:13:59 Well, did I interrupt someone?
02:14:01 Speaking of, when you said anti-vax,
02:14:03 the first thing I remembered was the John-tron shit.
02:14:08 Was that this week that John-tron went on that fucking rant?
02:14:12 John-tron is such a fucking dude.
02:14:13 I like his content, but when he gets into like political shit,
02:14:17 that's where I like turn my brain off.
02:14:18 I don't.
02:14:19 His old videos were funny.
02:14:21 He doesn't even make funny shit anymore.
02:14:23 No, you know what?
02:14:24 You know what's an app comparison?
02:14:26 John-tron and his wife are like Trixie and Riley.
02:14:29 They're both,
02:14:30 because they were both giving out different information.
02:14:33 How so?
02:14:34 Okay, so John-tron's wife was being a reply guy
02:14:38 and replying to a bunch of people.
02:14:40 And she was saying stuff like,
02:14:41 oh, he's not really anti-vax.
02:14:44 He's just against the animal abuse saying one thing.
02:14:46 And then John-tron's going like,
02:14:48 yeah, we got to question the science here,
02:14:50 like with the vaccine.
02:14:53 Just like how Trixie was saying,
02:14:55 oh, I said that just to her kid,
02:14:57 but then Raleigh was saying, no, no, no.
02:15:00 And then, oh, no, no, she was just clarifying.
02:15:03 Yeah, I see what she's saying, I see what she's saying.
02:15:06 Fucking weasels, fucking weasels,
02:15:08 Weasley little liars, dude.
02:15:10 Still lying, bro.
02:15:12 I don't understand how John-tron could be
02:15:15 very clearly saying something
02:15:17 and his wife could be reply guying to everybody
02:15:19 in the comments.
02:15:20 No, no, no, he's not anti-vax.
02:15:22 You see, he just hates the animal abuse, that's it.
02:15:25 That's a coat.
02:15:28 I've linked myself to this idiot.
02:15:31 I don't know, I have no idea what she's like,
02:15:33 but you defend someone like that.
02:15:36 So obviously being like a stupid,
02:15:39 like anti-science, like numpty, that's a cope.
02:15:45 It's a cope when you're trying to defend that.
02:15:48 Yeah, of course.
02:15:50 I wonder if, fucking, I wonder if,
02:15:52 speaking, just a funny note,
02:15:55 I saw a funny tweet from Nino earlier today
02:16:01 that Trixie retweeted and I thought it was
02:16:03 particularly good, it was,
02:16:07 Nino says, I've always hated numbers
02:16:09 and people who think purely with them,
02:16:11 those who are ruled by arithmetic
02:16:12 are the actual root of suffering in this world.
02:16:16 So Nino says, numbers, I don't believe in them
02:16:19 and Trixie's like, hell yeah, dude, this rules.
02:16:26 That's the sort of tweet you make
02:16:27 when you're stuck on a mass problem
02:16:29 in like middle school or something.
02:16:32 It's like, I don't, I mean, I really think,
02:16:34 it's just like, yeah, I don't believe data.
02:16:37 I believe anecdotes.
02:16:39 I believe anecdotal evidence.
02:16:40 Oh yeah, that's probably what it's about.
02:16:42 Yeah, I think that's the only takeaway I can take.
02:16:46 I say all these things and people come at me
02:16:48 with numbers proving me wrong and I'm like, man.
02:16:50 And I'm like, bro, but like I experienced-
02:16:53 But I inferred it, okay?
02:16:54 I inferred it, I'm smart.
02:16:56 I know a guy who said something happened one time, idiot.
02:17:00 Yeah, literally that's what it is.
02:17:02 Did you, did you two talk about-
02:17:05 That's the mindset, that's the mindset.
02:17:07 Facts don't matter.
02:17:08 Did you two talk about the grade A under A?
02:17:10 It literally feels over reels, literally feels over reels.
02:17:15 Should I comment on that?
02:17:16 Should I reply to Nino and be like, yeah, feels over reels?
02:17:19 No, he wouldn't even get it.
02:17:21 He wouldn't even understand if I try to criticize it.
02:17:24 Did you two talk about the grade A under A corona video?
02:17:28 No, it got deleted by YouTube.
02:17:31 I think I heard about that, but I don't care about grade A.
02:17:35 So I don't know why, what do you do?
02:17:37 So he made a video using data from when the coronavirus
02:17:41 first started becoming a thing in China.
02:17:44 So about two-year-old data and he was basically saying-
02:17:48 Was this a recent video?
02:17:49 Yes, this was like within the past week and a half, I believe.
02:17:54 It got taken down like within 24 hours
02:17:57 and he got a channel strike.
02:17:59 But he was basically-
02:18:01 Oh, because it was so incorrect.
02:18:03 Well, he was saying-
02:18:04 Was he saying the virus?
02:18:06 His argument was, listen, here's data from when
02:18:09 the virus first escaped in China.
02:18:12 As you could see, it only kills very old people
02:18:14 and very unhealthy people.
02:18:16 Therefore, 99% of the population are safe
02:18:19 and you don't have to give a shit.
02:18:23 That's so intelligent.
02:18:26 Oh, wait, no, I think I did see a bit of this.
02:18:29 It was like, oh, so 99%,
02:18:33 well, that means only like 100,000 people died.
02:18:36 So the virus isn't even that bad
02:18:38 and it was like brushing over the fact
02:18:40 that 100,000 people died.
02:18:42 That's still a lot of people.
02:18:44 That's not a good thing.
02:18:45 We should try to avoid even that.
02:18:46 Yeah, but it's 99%, yeah, but it's 99%.
02:18:49 99% of people survived.
02:18:51 If you go through a crowd of 100 people
02:18:55 and you only shoot one of them,
02:18:57 then you're 99% safe,
02:18:59 which means you're safe.
02:19:01 That's very safe.
02:19:02 99% is like a big percent.
02:19:04 Yeah, I mean, it's no surprise to anyone
02:19:07 that grade A is a complete idiot
02:19:09 when it comes to anything.
02:19:11 Yeah, I was honestly surprised
02:19:13 YouTube even let that video release
02:19:15 because it was set to premiere
02:19:17 for like two days before it came out.
02:19:20 But they took it down pretty fast afterwards.
02:19:23 Look at it.
02:19:24 Did they take it down?
02:19:27 Well,
02:19:30 I just don't personally trust any influencer
02:19:34 with anything that can be taken out of sensitive matter.
02:19:38 I would say that's probably an excellent position.
02:19:42 If I watch a YouTuber
02:19:45 and he is like content
02:19:47 because of him screaming and yelling,
02:19:50 I don't want to hear his political opinions
02:19:53 on why the left is bad
02:19:55 and COVID is actually made by the bourgeoisie, you know?
02:20:02 Yeah, bourgeoisie is possible for a lot of things,
02:20:05 but probably not COVID.
02:20:07 I think the word influencer is too nice.
02:20:10 It should be like manipulator.
02:20:12 That's what...
02:20:13 Hey, I'm a manipulator online.
02:20:15 I mean, it's fine.
02:20:16 Yeah, it's kind of true.
02:20:18 It's not...
02:20:19 It ain't wrong.
02:20:21 Do you guys want...
02:20:22 We've been going for a while.
02:20:23 Do you guys want to move into voicemails?
02:20:25 Oh, um...
02:20:26 Do you guys want to start listening to voicemail?
02:20:28 Unless there's anything else you want to get out there
02:20:30 before we start?
02:20:31 I have one thing to do.
02:20:34 You know, last time I was on your show,
02:20:37 I feel really bad because I softball-gibbed
02:20:40 with a very, very clean ABDL post.
02:20:43 So, this time I've decided not to softball you.
02:20:47 Oh.
02:20:48 So, I have two ABDL posts.
02:20:50 One for Gibb, one for Ben.
02:20:54 All right.
02:20:55 All right.
02:20:57 If I must.
02:20:59 If I must, let's have them.
02:21:01 All right, I will post Gibb's first.
02:21:03 It's in links.
02:21:05 Okay.
02:21:06 And for those of you who don't know...
02:21:08 This is a Reddit post.
02:21:10 These are Reddit posts of the variety
02:21:12 that one might find on Shreddit.
02:21:14 We have a segment at the end of the episode,
02:21:16 every episode, ABDL posts of the week,
02:21:18 because it's not hard to go on the ABDL subreddit
02:21:21 and find a post to just make fun of.
02:21:23 That's funny.
02:21:25 Oh, God, I'm reading this one.
02:21:27 I'm gonna read it without reading it first.
02:21:30 Okay.
02:21:32 First time messing.
02:21:34 Didn't know what to expect.
02:21:36 Not safe for work.
02:21:38 I'm home alone right now
02:21:40 and figured that'd be the best time for some little antics.
02:21:43 I have my p-patchy.
02:21:45 What is that?
02:21:46 Passy.
02:21:47 Passifier.
02:21:48 Oh, my.
02:21:49 Okay.
02:21:50 Why'd you need to...
02:21:52 He said we're on a nickname basis.
02:21:54 I have my passy, my bottle, and I'm padded.
02:21:57 I felt the pressure in my bowels.
02:21:59 And while I hadn't anticipated messing,
02:22:02 it seemed like a good opportunity.
02:22:04 So now, here I am,
02:22:07 in a soggy, stinky, good night,
02:22:10 trying hard not to let my diaper leak
02:22:13 and laying on my side because I haven't tried sitting in it.
02:22:16 Any ideas of what I should do now?
02:22:18 Nine comments.
02:22:19 He doesn't say do now.
02:22:20 What I should now.
02:22:21 Any ideas of what I should now.
02:22:23 Not that that matters much.
02:22:25 Um, soggy, stinky, good night
02:22:27 is a fucking winner of a phrase.
02:22:34 So, soggy, stinky, good night.
02:22:36 So, what advice should you give them?
02:22:39 What should they do now?
02:22:41 What should they now?
02:22:42 Nine comments.
02:22:43 Well, I'll tell you what they shouldn't do.
02:22:45 Ninety percent upvoted.
02:22:47 Ninety percent upvoted is the funniest part.
02:22:49 What they probably shouldn't do is remove the diaper,
02:22:52 clean the feces off of their body,
02:22:55 and get a job.
02:22:59 Become a productive member of society.
02:23:01 Just working McDonald's.
02:23:02 Yeah, really, if you think about it, this...
02:23:05 You shouldn't let a child sit in their diaper
02:23:08 in their soggy stinky.
02:23:10 It sounds so...
02:23:11 It's child abuse.
02:23:12 It sounds so painful.
02:23:13 It sounds uncomfortable.
02:23:15 I feel sorry for him, but he loves it, I guess.
02:23:20 Oh, God.
02:23:22 Okay, well, here's mine, I guess.
02:23:24 That reaction.
02:23:26 All right.
02:23:27 Okay.
02:23:29 Do you make your guy's penis get smaller in the scene?
02:23:33 That's S-M-O-L, smaller in the scene, NSFW.
02:23:38 So this cold weather and my peepee being effected in that way
02:23:43 has me wondering, do you ever do things to make your 18-plus
02:23:47 baby's penis to shrink?
02:23:49 Like maybe having them do work in the cold or other methods,
02:23:52 so when it's change time, you're able to comment about his penis.
02:23:56 Sorry if this is too much.
02:23:58 There's so much to unpack here.
02:24:02 Oh, so this is from a partner of a baby ABDL person.
02:24:07 Yes.
02:24:08 Yeah.
02:24:09 Okay, you know...
02:24:10 They make them go work in the cold, so they're pee-
02:24:13 They make them do something cold to make their penis shrink.
02:24:15 So wait, but...
02:24:16 So that when they change their diaper, they have a little,
02:24:18 a small penis, more reminiscent of a baby's penis.
02:24:21 So their partner messes in a diaper and they change that
02:24:25 and they want to focus on calling out a small penis.
02:24:31 I mean...
02:24:33 I mean, if that's...
02:24:36 If that's what they're into.
02:24:40 Let's make an NFT of these posts.
02:24:45 And it'll be the worst thing of all time.
02:24:48 Jesus.
02:24:49 I've... I've just... I've just... I've just... I've just... I've just...
02:24:55 I feel like I have nothing to say about that one.
02:24:58 It just speaks for itself.
02:25:01 All right.
02:25:02 That one, for some reason, only 65% upvoted.
02:25:05 Yeah, people didn't seem big fans of that one.
02:25:09 I don't know.
02:25:10 I'm not sure what it is.
02:25:11 They like their baby penis big, I guess.
02:25:14 Honestly.
02:25:15 Honestly?
02:25:17 Same, though.
02:25:19 All right.
02:25:20 Real quick.
02:25:21 Where the fuck did you find these?
02:25:24 Oh, reddit.com.
02:25:26 These are on the...
02:25:27 R slash ABDL.
02:25:28 It's the adult baby diaper lover subreddit.
02:25:31 I literally was on there for less than five seconds when I pulled these two posts.
02:25:36 Like, I did not have to look.
02:25:38 Yeah.
02:25:39 This is about what I would expect.
02:25:42 I mean, what do you expect when you go on R slash ABDL?
02:25:46 Like, honestly, you're the problem here, all right?
02:25:49 These people are just trying to live.
02:25:51 They're in their natural habitat and you're going in and you're trying to fuck with them.
02:25:55 Hold on.
02:25:56 I have one more to show you.
02:25:58 Now, we did read this in an episode.
02:26:00 Oh, God.
02:26:01 But this is the pin post on there.
02:26:04 Give me one.
02:26:05 All right.
02:26:06 Pinned, huh?
02:26:07 Like, safety pinned?
02:26:09 Like, my dipey.
02:26:11 No, like, this is the head mod making an announcement to the subreddit.
02:26:17 Yes, I know, I know.
02:26:19 There you go.
02:26:21 Reminder, don't be creeps on other subs.
02:26:25 I'm appalled I have to post this once more.
02:26:28 We've had reports that some of our members have been trying to engage in a creepy way with people from incontinence subs.
02:26:35 Don't do that.
02:26:36 It's creepy and you give all of us ABDL peeps a bad rep.
02:26:40 We're working hard to make ABDL more accepted, but this kind of behavior will make many people think we're creeps.
02:26:46 Several people got banned from our sub because of this behavior.
02:26:49 It's perfectly fine to participate in those subs normally.
02:26:53 The F, you're actually incontinent.
02:26:58 We know there's overlap and we want both communities to get along.
02:27:01 Thank you and stay padded, Bottle Emoji, whether you need it or not.
02:27:05 So what happened?
02:27:07 Dude, ending my ABDL YouTube channel with, hey guys, thanks for watching and remember, stay padded, whether you need it or not.
02:27:16 Signing out.
02:27:17 I'll get you the next time.
02:27:18 Hey, everyone, it's Crinklebottom, seven flowers, seven ears.
02:27:21 I'm going to end my daffodil video by saying that.
02:27:25 Stay padded, bro.
02:27:27 Make sure not to shit yourself too hard.
02:27:29 Stay padded.
02:27:30 So wait, what's an incontinence subreddit?
02:27:33 Incontinence is where...
02:27:34 What do you think it is?
02:27:36 No, I know what it is, but why would you have a subreddit for it?
02:27:39 Because you like it or because you just know?
02:27:41 No, I think it's probably dealing with the medical issue.
02:27:45 The deep lore of this post is that people from the ABDL subreddit were going onto the incontinence subreddit and seeing pictures of women and commenting,
02:27:55 hey girl, do you shit with that ass?
02:27:58 See, that doesn't sound like a very little thing to do.
02:28:02 That sounds like something any creepy guy would do.
02:28:06 Or anyone who's a fan of Tommy Carson.
02:28:11 I assume they were doing weird little role play stuff.
02:28:15 No.
02:28:16 Or asking people about their diapers.
02:28:18 No.
02:28:19 It was these people hitting on others for medical disorder that they fetishized.
02:28:26 Yes, okay.
02:28:27 It's nice to be valued.
02:28:29 It's nice to be valued.
02:28:30 I guess I never really thought of going to a subreddit for a medical issue.
02:28:36 Yeah, that's a new one.
02:28:37 I've never heard of this.
02:28:38 Sure.
02:28:39 I guess it makes sense.
02:28:40 It's like support groups.
02:28:41 Makes sense.
02:28:42 Yeah.
02:28:43 Yeah, basically.
02:28:44 Or asking advice on how to...
02:28:45 Yeah, I know certain subreddits for...
02:28:51 If your kid gets diagnosed with something, how do you deal with that as a support type aspect?
02:29:00 Yeah.
02:29:01 Yes.
02:29:02 That makes sense.
02:29:03 But commenting that...
02:29:05 And then ABDL...
02:29:06 Hey, yo, you shit with that ass?
02:29:08 Oh my fucking god.
02:29:10 This actually reminds me.
02:29:12 There is actually some overlap because there are some members of the ABDL subreddit that
02:29:18 quote have achieved the next level of human evolution.
02:29:22 End quote.
02:29:23 And these people that say that basically just train their body to be incontinence.
02:29:27 They took away their ability to control their own bladder and they'll go on the ABDL subreddit
02:29:32 and brag about it.
02:29:33 Like, ah, yes, I am now better than everyone.
02:29:35 I have achieved the next stage of human evolution.
02:29:38 I have removed my ability to control when I shit.
02:29:43 Except they're being...
02:29:44 They're not being ironic.
02:29:46 They're being serious.
02:29:47 So that's why there is some overlap.
02:29:49 They happily train their body to just lose this ability and it's so weird.
02:29:56 I want...
02:29:58 I want to move on voicemails.
02:30:00 Yeah.
02:30:01 I don't want...
02:30:02 I don't want...
02:30:03 No more.
02:30:04 No more.
02:30:05 No more.
02:30:06 I've had enough.
02:30:07 I've had enough.
02:30:08 All right.
02:30:09 This is the first voicemail.
02:30:11 Here we go.
02:30:12 This one is called...
02:30:14 Fuck Trixie.
02:30:15 All right.
02:30:17 On the count of three, let's listen.
02:30:20 Three, two, one, go.
02:30:24 Okay.
02:30:29 What was that?
02:30:30 This is not...
02:30:31 I think...
02:30:32 I believe he said, I hope Trixie chokes on a fucking dick and dies.
02:30:36 I believe that is what was said there.
02:30:39 I heard dick and pole.
02:30:40 I couldn't hear it because it was coming out of my sp...
02:30:42 I thought bowls.
02:30:43 Okay.
02:30:44 Well, whatever.
02:30:45 Okay.
02:30:46 I mean, whatever.
02:30:47 Yeah.
02:30:48 Okay.
02:30:50 The next voicemail is called Beyond the Pale.
02:30:55 Here we go.
02:30:57 Three, two, one, go.
02:30:59 I just want to say that after the Golden Witches coked out like shitfests on Twitter today,
02:31:06 I'm upping my pledges to the various Patreons.
02:31:09 She can go burn hell.
02:31:12 She's a vile, wretched, like third rank intellect narcissist that's eating this fucking loser.
02:31:21 Fuck off and die.
02:31:22 I would agree with all that.
02:31:23 I would agree with all that.
02:31:24 I love you, Ben, Gib, Tom, fuck.
02:31:29 Yes, definitely true.
02:31:31 Third rate intellect is the one that doesn't...
02:31:33 People talk a lot about what a shitty person she is.
02:31:36 Nobody talks about that.
02:31:37 She's kind of just fucking stupid.
02:31:38 She's kind of just like low intelligence, like idiot, and always has been.
02:31:43 We need more people talking about that one.
02:31:47 Next voicemail is called Why Would Trixie Say That?
02:31:53 Three, two, one, go.
02:31:56 I'm sure lots has already been said about Trixie and her weird little podcast segment,
02:32:03 where she just makes a pool of herself.
02:32:06 But one thing which I especially did not like was the criticizing of Gib for making funny
02:32:15 little words and phrases, like you give him an inch, and they'll take your splinch.
02:32:24 You're just messing with words, saying funny things that just sound funny, even if they
02:32:29 don't make sense, saying that, oh, Gib's not funny.
02:32:33 Why?
02:32:34 Why would you say that?
02:32:37 Gib is funny.
02:32:38 That's funny.
02:32:39 It's funny when she said splinch.
02:32:42 I mean, that's the humor that Gib's videos have always had.
02:32:47 That's the humor she's always had.
02:32:48 And it's always been funny.
02:32:50 Trixie used to think that was funny.
02:32:52 Because it's funny.
02:32:57 It was such a nothing little comment to then pick it up, like, oh, clip that out of the
02:33:02 episode.
02:33:03 Oh, I got to bring this to show my dick show friends.
02:33:05 What a loser this person is.
02:33:07 They're so not funny because they said this word.
02:33:09 They made up a silly word randomly.
02:33:11 I make silly words without really thinking.
02:33:15 And instead of making fun of someone and laughing at their misfortune or whatever, passes for
02:33:21 jokes on shows like that.
02:33:23 Yeah.
02:33:24 It's just, it's just, I don't know.
02:33:27 That was such a nothing thing as well.
02:33:30 It really, it really was like, why, why even bother talking about this?
02:33:35 Next one is called Go Gib exclamation point three, two, one, go.
02:33:41 Hey, after that whole crap with Trixie and what are these podcasts?
02:33:46 I had one thing on my mind.
02:33:48 And I hope I speak for others as well.
02:33:51 If I just say, hey, Gib, we love you.
02:33:55 You're a great and your best girl.
02:33:58 Peace.
02:33:59 Peace.
02:34:00 Thanks.
02:34:01 Thank you.
02:34:02 Thank you.
02:34:03 I'm changing my voice to be more feminine.
02:34:10 Thanks for the voicemail.
02:34:12 Next one is called I'm so sweepy three, two, one, go.
02:34:20 Wow.
02:34:21 I'm pooped.
02:34:22 Gosh.
02:34:23 Has anyone else noticed that when you're tired, it's easier to go to sleep compared to
02:34:29 when you're not tired?
02:34:33 It's just found that interesting.
02:34:35 Anyone else that noticed this?
02:34:39 Please give me one.
02:34:41 Okay.
02:34:42 This is a reference to I think Trixie's last sub stack article, which is two pages of
02:34:49 her opining about how concentrating is hard sometimes and how it's easier to go to sleep
02:34:56 when you're tired.
02:34:57 Wait, is that what she said?
02:35:00 Yes.
02:35:01 Yes.
02:35:02 How on earth could I guess weed?
02:35:06 I mean, it's sort of supposed to be like a metaphor for like, it's like, do things.
02:35:16 It's like, hey, do things because if you do things, you'll be tired and you'll have an
02:35:24 easier time sleeping.
02:35:26 Oh my God.
02:35:27 And you won't be forcing yourself to sleep when you're not tired.
02:35:30 That is the weirdest thing I've ever heard.
02:35:32 It doesn't make any sense.
02:35:34 That's so strange.
02:35:35 I don't get it.
02:35:37 It's stupid.
02:35:38 Is she getting it?
02:35:39 Okay.
02:35:40 I don't know.
02:35:41 Is she trying to say it?
02:35:43 This was the one that she wrote that she had to furiously tell.
02:35:47 It was after she posted the What Are These? podcast thing.
02:35:50 She spent the rest of the night writing that article.
02:35:52 She passed out writing that article about how it's easier to go to sleep when you're tired
02:35:58 and then woke up the next day and finished it.
02:36:00 And it has nothing to do with any of the stuff on Twitter.
02:36:03 It's completely unrelated.
02:36:04 It's just a totally pointless, like, concentrating is hard and sometimes I don't like when people
02:36:08 talk to me.
02:36:09 And also, sleeping is hard unless you're tired.
02:36:12 Okay.
02:36:13 Thanks for reading.
02:36:14 Bye.
02:36:15 Is she trying to imply that, oh, I know that you sleep better if you're constantly busy.
02:36:20 I'm such a hard worker, Teehee.
02:36:22 I think it's supposed to be something like that.
02:36:25 Yeah.
02:36:26 It's about working hard to get shit done.
02:36:32 Get shit done is the point.
02:36:34 The next one is called Staggering If True, and it's not a voicemail.
02:36:38 It's a Reddit link.
02:36:40 Oh, no.
02:36:41 So I guess I will...
02:36:42 How could you, Ben?
02:36:43 I guess I will...
02:36:44 Oh, here it is.
02:36:46 Link doesn't work.
02:36:48 Staggering If True, and here's the image.
02:36:51 It's this one.
02:36:53 I've seen that.
02:36:56 I haven't played Celeste.
02:36:58 I haven't beaten it, but I've played a bunch of it.
02:37:01 That's pretty good.
02:37:02 It's a good video game.
02:37:04 It's a fun platformer.
02:37:07 It's about how trans people can double jump, but nobody appreciates.
02:37:11 Yes.
02:37:12 Nobody gets to that.
02:37:15 Okay.
02:37:16 Good joke.
02:37:18 Next voicemail is called Trixie Disavows Hatred.
02:37:25 Here we go.
02:37:27 There it is.
02:37:28 Three, two, one, go.
02:37:30 If you're hateful, you're wrong.
02:37:32 You are wrong.
02:37:34 You are wrong.
02:37:36 You are wrong.
02:37:38 True.
02:37:39 This is a smart person must have written that.
02:37:42 That bar.
02:37:44 Next voicemail is called...
02:37:50 Next voicemail is called Riley the Golden Pimp.
02:37:53 Three, two, one, go.
02:37:57 Hey guys, it's Riley the Golden Pimp.
02:38:00 Cowboys.
02:38:01 Halloween.
02:38:03 What?
02:38:08 Insightful.
02:38:10 I get the ball coin.
02:38:11 I make things happen.
02:38:14 I make things happen.
02:38:16 I produce.
02:38:17 I'm a producer.
02:38:19 I'm a visionary.
02:38:21 Best thing.
02:38:23 You know how it is.
02:38:24 I do.
02:38:25 Do you like receding hairlines?
02:38:28 Do you say receding hairlines?
02:38:33 Cool.
02:38:34 I like the nondescript diddly-diddly noises for what producing sounds like.
02:38:39 Just slurping.
02:38:42 I'm producing.
02:38:44 I'm producing.
02:38:49 Okay.
02:38:50 Next one is called Cats.
02:38:52 Three, two, one, go.
02:38:57 It's a dead cat.
02:38:59 Oh no, it's a dead, dead cat.
02:39:02 What we gonna do about the dead cat?
02:39:05 I'm so very sad because we've got a dead cat.
02:39:08 One minute this cat was alive and now this cat is a dead cat.
02:39:13 Oh no, I'm so sad about this dead cat.
02:39:18 Oh yes I am.
02:39:21 It was such a good nice little cat when it was alive.
02:39:26 Now it's just a dead cat.
02:39:29 Okay, thanks for the song.
02:39:31 Next one is called Kodoma.
02:39:35 Three, two, one, go.
02:39:37 I'm still listening to the dead cat.
02:39:39 No, three, two, one, go.
02:39:41 Okay, I'm sorry if this has literally nothing to do with the current episode,
02:39:45 but I have a slight feeling that it probably is.
02:39:47 I'm guessing we're probably talking about a lot of how Trixie and...
02:39:51 A bit, yeah, a bit.
02:39:52 Just absolute idiots.
02:39:54 But I need to like put a bit of highlight on Riley
02:39:56 and how much of a fucking in-step moron Riley actually is.
02:40:00 This motherfucker, and ironically thinks that just because Trixie is trans,
02:40:04 she's exempt of being called out on transphobia.
02:40:06 I've been arguing with this motherfucker for 20 minutes on Twitter.
02:40:08 He explicitly thinks that.
02:40:09 And he's not understanding any point anybody's trying to make.
02:40:12 I think Shreddit tried arguing with him.
02:40:14 Nothing.
02:40:15 He's just some fucking weird stoner.
02:40:17 He's a weird guy.
02:40:18 I don't like him.
02:40:19 He might be the stupidest.
02:40:21 He might actually be the stupidest.
02:40:23 He is very stupid.
02:40:24 I don't know what.
02:40:26 I'm sorry.
02:40:27 Okay, bye.
02:40:28 Base Shreddit call-out.
02:40:30 It's pretty dumb.
02:40:31 Base Shreddit call-out.
02:40:33 Yeah, he, um...
02:40:35 I described him recently on Twitter to someone who asked like who is Riley.
02:40:41 I said he's just some stoner vagrant who's good at kissing ass.
02:40:45 That's what he does is he finds like people who's like money he wants
02:40:48 and he just kisses their ass until like they like say that they're his friend.
02:40:52 And then he can say, oh, I'm Dick Masterson's producer.
02:40:56 Oh, I'm Yeeg Studio's producer.
02:40:58 I have all these credits.
02:40:59 I'm a successful musician or whatever because I have,
02:41:02 I'm on a music YouTube channel with 300,000 subscribers or whatever.
02:41:07 Right?
02:41:08 Fake it till you make it.
02:41:10 I'm looking to the, to the, to the ultimate experience.
02:41:12 I do have to say this and you'll probably appreciate this, Ben.
02:41:15 Um, so my co-host Kai the Kitty Lewis, he is actually a fan of the Dick Show.
02:41:20 He keeps up with it.
02:41:22 Uh, and we were talking about the argument with Riley and he says,
02:41:25 no, no, see the funniest part about all this is that anyone that is deep into
02:41:30 the Dick Show lore knows that they just keep Riley around to laugh at them.
02:41:34 Like Dick...
02:41:35 Is that true?
02:41:36 I don't understand Riley's relationship to the Dick Show at all.
02:41:39 So apparently Dick hires people just for the meme.
02:41:43 He doesn't expect them to actually do anything.
02:41:45 That's why Riley doesn't actually do anything.
02:41:47 Like he just keeps them around for a circus.
02:41:50 Does he pay them?
02:41:52 Uh, I don't know.
02:41:53 Why would you just pay people for nothing?
02:41:56 Okay, I don't see what's so entertaining about Riley that I would want to keep him
02:42:01 around for, for amusement, but like, I guess it makes, I mean, I know,
02:42:05 but I know, like obviously he's not like, obviously he's not useful for anything.
02:42:09 So I mean, this kind of makes sense.
02:42:11 Like there's no other reason I could think of that you would want him around.
02:42:15 Uh, so I, I, fair enough, fair enough.
02:42:21 I could imagine Dick finding some amusement in the idea of, of Riley thinking that he's
02:42:28 the producer of the Dick Show and actually not really doing anything.
02:42:32 I guess.
02:42:33 Yeah.
02:42:34 That's kind of funny.
02:42:36 Yeah.
02:42:37 It would be, I would, I might find it funny if, if, if it weren't so, if I weren't like
02:42:41 personally annoyed by him on like a, on like, on like an in-person basis.
02:42:45 I mean by in-person, I mean on Twitter.
02:42:48 Um, next voicemail is, uh, is called, it's called, uh, three, two, one, go.
02:42:57 What's up, fuckers?
02:42:59 It's me, Riley.
02:43:01 Oh my God, he's here.
02:43:03 Hey, Ben and Gib, you are, respectively, a not cool dude and not cool lady.
02:43:13 What the fuckers?
02:43:15 How could you, how could you fucking say so?
02:43:17 I can't believe you'd be so transphobic.
02:43:20 I can't believe you would say something like that on national television.
02:43:27 Ah, but you gotta respect, ah, but you gotta hand it to him though.
02:43:33 But you gotta hand it to him.
02:43:36 What do I gotta hand to him?
02:43:38 Uh, whatever you got.
02:43:39 Whatever you got, empty your pockets right now.
02:43:41 Give him, hand it over, fork it over.
02:43:44 Oh, damn.
02:43:45 Oh, the one ring, oh, the one ring was in my pocket.
02:43:48 Ah, darn.
02:43:49 Ah, Gollum guessed it right.
02:43:51 My, my estrogen podrance.
02:43:53 Uh, next, next one is called Goll, question mark.
02:43:58 Uh, three, two, one, go.
02:44:01 Cat and phantom horn.
02:44:03 Strange things been happening down here in Equestria.
02:44:06 A mysterious pony named Nylon Tusk has come to Ponyville.
02:44:09 Nylon Tusk.
02:44:10 And he started selling something called Ponycone.
02:44:12 And now everyone's gone apples buying and selling them to each other.
02:44:15 I'm worried, Phant, what if Ponycone ain't worth a bit in a few years?
02:44:18 Where Pinkie Pie's already lost 30 nasinotic?
02:44:21 That was her and Aaron and Phant.
02:44:23 I'm not buying into Tusk, Esteem.
02:44:25 He's trying to run off with every pony's bitch.
02:44:27 So you know what I did instead?
02:44:29 I took my money down to the main Manhattan Stock Exchange.
02:44:32 I got invested in the pony tick industry.
02:44:34 You know what I bought shares of?
02:44:36 Apple.
02:44:37 It would be unironically based if like a kid show like My Little Pony had an episode about like kids don't buy crypto.
02:44:47 It's a scam.
02:44:52 Thanks, Applejack.
02:44:54 Oh, Nylon Tusk, Elon Musk.
02:44:56 I get it.
02:44:57 I get it.
02:44:58 Very pretty good.
02:45:00 Pretty good.
02:45:01 You know what?
02:45:02 Just an unironically good and cool voicemail that I liked.
02:45:05 Hell yeah.
02:45:06 Also wait, that was wrong.
02:45:08 I hated it when Applejack buying stocks and Apple, but other than that it was good.
02:45:13 I didn't see it coming.
02:45:15 Maybe I'm just stupid.
02:45:16 By the way, sorry, that was the wrong voicemail.
02:45:18 That one was actually called Applejack.
02:45:21 This is the one that is actually called Goal, question mark.
02:45:24 Can we put Applejack in the voice grail?
02:45:27 Yeah.
02:45:28 I think Applejack the character from My Little Pony.
02:45:30 I think she deserves it.
02:45:31 I think Applejack deserves to go in the voice grail.
02:45:33 I think she's earned her place.
02:45:36 That's the first placement in there for a while.
02:45:40 Okay, this one is called Goal, question mark three, two, one, go.
02:45:45 And during your Patreon podcast, question everything, stretching your fast forward.
02:45:55 Six inches now.
02:45:56 What's your question mark?
02:46:01 Zena, fucking hierarchy.
02:46:06 No, I'm happy with six inches.
02:46:08 I've achieved everything I set out to do.
02:46:11 I've broken through, I've broken down the impossible already.
02:46:14 It's time for me to retire at the top.
02:46:17 Next voicemail is not a voicemail.
02:46:20 It is an Imgirlink.
02:46:21 Here's the image.
02:46:23 What is this?
02:46:27 Some people have read a few Marxist books and think themselves quite learned,
02:46:31 but what they have read has not penetrated, has not stuck root in their minds.
02:46:36 So they do not know how to use it, and their class feelings remain as of old.
02:46:40 Others are very conceited and having learned some book phrases,
02:46:43 think themselves terrific and are very cocky.
02:46:46 But whenever a storm blows up, they take a stand very different from that of the workers
02:46:50 and the majority of the peasants.
02:46:52 They waver while the latter stand firm.
02:46:54 They equivocate while the latter are forthright.
02:46:57 Mao Zedong, the little red book, quotations from Chairman Mao Zetong.
02:47:04 I mean, sounds true?
02:47:11 I guess what this is saying is posers bad.
02:47:15 Yeah.
02:47:16 Posers is bad.
02:47:17 Posers is bad.
02:47:19 This is like fake allies and whatever.
02:47:22 Fair weather allies.
02:47:24 Is he talking about the Democrats?
02:47:26 Maybe not.
02:47:27 Maybe that's not even...
02:47:30 I mean, Mao seems to have had some pretty based quotes in his life.
02:47:35 I've seen a bunch of Mao quotes around and he definitely said some things I agree with.
02:47:40 So that's cool.
02:47:42 Yeah.
02:47:43 Shame what he did.
02:47:45 I don't even know that much about what he did.
02:47:47 I assume he killed people and did tyranny.
02:47:50 It was sort of like a bad handling of China.
02:47:53 I'm pretty sure he's the one that said that he was going to reward farmers for each pigeon killed
02:48:01 because he was tired of all the pigeons and then because...
02:48:04 Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
02:48:06 And then because the birds went extinct, the insects no longer had a predator
02:48:11 and they had a massive famine that killed millions.
02:48:14 That's very funny.
02:48:16 That's very funny.
02:48:17 They tried to do...
02:48:18 That's what they did with emus in Australia.
02:48:21 Australia and China are the only two countries that have declared war on birds and lost.
02:48:28 And they both lost.
02:48:30 Well, I guess for China they won, but it was like a Pyrrhic victory that damaged them just as much.
02:48:35 And then like, yeah, I think Australia just lost the war against the emus.
02:48:41 Birds, man.
02:48:42 Wait, how do you even fight the emus?
02:48:44 Prime Minister.
02:48:46 You can't.
02:48:47 They're too powerful.
02:48:48 There's a great Sam O'Nella video about it.
02:48:52 They literally took jeeps and mounted gatling guns on the backs of jeeps
02:48:58 and tried to just ride into the fucking outback and just gun down flocks of emus.
02:49:04 And it didn't work.
02:49:06 Are they bulletproof?
02:49:08 You can kill them with bullets, but they take a while to die and they don't go down immediately.
02:49:14 And when they're densely packed together, you can only shoot a few at a time.
02:49:19 They have strengthened numbers.
02:49:22 You can't just immediately mow down the entire herd.
02:49:26 What the fuck are people riding the war on birds?
02:49:28 You just gotta get a bazooka.
02:49:29 Just ride emus.
02:49:30 Oh my god.
02:49:32 Call America and get a drone.
02:49:34 That reminds me.
02:49:35 I saw in the news two days ago, I think it was Pablo Escobar's cocaine hippos
02:49:42 are now being legally recognized as people with human rights.
02:49:47 Cocaine hippos?
02:49:48 Is it white?
02:49:49 Yeah.
02:49:50 Oh, I saw that and it made so little sense that I didn't even think about it.
02:49:54 You're cocaine hippos.
02:49:57 What's a cocaine hippo?
02:49:59 Is it a hippo that is infused with cocaine in a DNA?
02:50:02 It's a hippo that will eat the plant that cocaine comes from,
02:50:06 but also protect them from people trying to steal the plants
02:50:10 or people trying to mess with his farms.
02:50:12 Because I don't know if you know about hippos,
02:50:14 but hippos are very vicious animals.
02:50:16 They can and will kill people very easily.
02:50:19 I've heard that they can kill these people.
02:50:22 Yeah.
02:50:23 Yeah, hippos are scary, dude.
02:50:25 I hate them.
02:50:28 They terrify me.
02:50:29 They've been rhinos.
02:50:31 I mean, I would probably, if one was coming at me, I'd be scared as shit.
02:50:35 Yeah, of course.
02:50:37 Next voicemail is called, it's just called DeVoo.
02:50:41 Three, two, one, go.
02:50:44 I love DeVoo!
02:50:47 Well, good for you.
02:50:49 Yeah, yeah.
02:50:51 Well done.
02:50:53 Next voicemail is an Imgirlink.
02:50:55 Here's the image.
02:50:57 Nate the type of fella to say nice kitty after falling into the tiger enclosure
02:51:03 at the zoo.
02:51:06 At the zoo.
02:51:08 True?
02:51:11 I can see it.
02:51:12 I mean, that doesn't seem like...
02:51:14 Nate has a little Harambe moment.
02:51:16 Harambe moment.
02:51:18 And he's like, oh, nice kitty.
02:51:21 I'm gonna be a friend to you, so you don't kill me.
02:51:27 I hate animals.
02:51:28 I fucking hate strong animals.
02:51:30 Get that shit away from me.
02:51:32 What do you define as a strong animal?
02:51:34 Like a zoo animal?
02:51:36 Anything that could kill me.
02:51:38 Anything that could kill me is unacceptable.
02:51:40 So like a dog?
02:51:41 If...
02:51:43 No, I'll kill the dog first.
02:51:44 Okay, okay.
02:51:46 No, I'll kill the dog.
02:51:48 If you're gonna make an exposed video on them, do not cut this clip.
02:51:51 It is out of context.
02:51:52 I will.
02:51:53 I will kill a dog.
02:51:54 I will kill your dog.
02:51:55 If I fucking see your dog on this read, it's over.
02:51:58 It's over.
02:52:00 It's over.
02:52:01 You're a pain to judge.
02:52:02 Oh, no.
02:52:03 Not Scruffy.
02:52:04 Insanely dogfoaming.
02:52:06 Insanely dogfoaming.
02:52:08 If it's a big dog?
02:52:09 Yeah.
02:52:10 If it's a big dog.
02:52:12 Next voicemail is called,
02:52:15 Get fucked bitch.
02:52:17 Three, two, one, go.
02:52:20 Vod, Vod.
02:52:21 I have some cruel stuff to say about Trixie that I have no reason to hold back anymore.
02:52:25 I believe she's copying her new videos about an animal.
02:52:29 She's copying the style of this more successful, younger, hotter, trans girl, anime video aces
02:52:36 called Hazel because she was a young e-girl.
02:52:42 As she mentions in one of her texts on her sub-stack, she mentions how she loves how the
02:52:51 e-girls on TikTok have their little decorated rooms, while you're too old, let go, nobody
02:52:58 you live in a Prius, get fucked, you old bitch.
02:53:02 Yeah, I googled Hazel and I can't find anyone named that, I don't know how to spell it.
02:53:08 Yeah, I don't know how to spell it.
02:53:11 I know she likes the fucking e-girl makeup shit and wants to be an e-girl or whatever.
02:53:21 I think she's given up on physical aspects of transitioning.
02:53:27 She seems to be putting less and less effort into it and in recent sub-stack articles she
02:53:32 kind of implied like, yeah, people see me as a man, people see me and my fiance as gay
02:53:38 men but like, fuck it, I don't care, she probably does care but she is coping or something,
02:53:48 she seems to, she's saying, fuck it, it seems like, I don't know, that's just me trying
02:53:56 to, that's just me trying to connect dots, that's not any kind of like, I know that for
02:54:01 sure or anything.
02:54:04 Next voicemail is Red Five Rainbow, is that it, did I put the right one?
02:54:11 Yes, I did, okay, Red Five Rainbow, three, two, one, go.
02:54:17 I was just listening to Ben's Patreon podcast and I just absolutely love listening to Ben
02:54:25 talking about churning, it obviously works so well with this brain, with all the numbers
02:54:30 and this and this will happen, if I don't do that, then I'll miss out on this and yada,
02:54:34 yada, yada, but Ben, Ben, Bitcoin is not the same, Bitcoin is a gamble, it is not a guarantee,
02:54:43 you don't know how Bitcoin works, please stop talking about Bitcoin, you're not losing
02:54:48 money when you don't put the money in and then it goes up because you didn't know it
02:54:53 was going to go up, it's a gamble.
02:54:55 Oh my God, no, I know it's a gamble, but you're wrong, if a different currency goes up, you
02:55:04 have less value compared to like the sum total of all wealth in the world, I'm sorry, it's
02:55:11 just true, it's just true, it is an opportunity cost that you have lost, you have lost value
02:55:16 by not investing if another asset goes up and yours does not, it's just true.
02:55:21 How often do you talk about crypto, man?
02:55:25 Not that often, I mean, I've talked a little bit about it.
02:55:29 For a while there, it was all the time.
02:55:31 For a while there, I was talking about it a lot, I talked more, I went on a whole, yeah,
02:55:38 on the last Patreon.com slash Ben St Q&A, I went into excruciating detail about my credit card
02:55:46 churning strategies and stuff, I'm glad Red Fever appreciated that.
02:55:51 I know I don't understand the technical aspect of Bitcoin, please understand it,
02:55:56 when I say that I lost money, I'm talking about a missed opportunity cost.
02:56:01 Is it important, am I saying like, oh, I should always invest because what if I lose money?
02:56:05 No, because it's equally true that if you are invested and it goes down, then you've also
02:56:11 lost money, I understand like there's risk involved no matter what, but it's just true to
02:56:15 say that if something you are not invested in goes up, you have lost by not being invested in it.
02:56:22 This might be the most brain dead way of thinking about crypto, but I think of crypto and NFTs as
02:56:27 you know like CSGO gambling, where you like you get like nice and stuff like that and you gamble.
02:56:31 Yeah, I don't know about CSGO gambling.
02:56:34 Oh, so like you can buy like these skins and they go up or down in profits,
02:56:38 and they're like completely online to have no real world value, you know?
02:56:43 That's how I think about it at least.
02:56:45 I mean, I don't know if that's brilliant.
02:56:47 Well, in game, you can have a skin, I guess.
02:56:49 Yeah, true, and in NFTs, you get a monkey, so.
02:56:51 There's more than, yeah, but there's.
02:56:55 Well, you can just right click save the monkey.
02:56:58 True.
02:56:58 Yeah, you're right, you can't like right click save have the skin.
02:57:01 Oh, that'd be so sick if they did that.
02:57:03 Next voicemail is called, uh, subject bonus pod,
02:57:08 Solaru0311 they them pronouns at gmail.com.
02:57:14 Okay, three, two, oh, this must, this must be about the, uh, the recent bonus where we react to the,
02:57:20 the, who are these pods with Trixie.
02:57:22 Three, two, one, go.
02:57:26 Hey all, just wanted to send a message in for once.
02:57:29 The bonus pond on Thursday, which everyone here should be listening to by
02:57:33 signing up at patreon.com slash the procrastinators was cathartic and much needed.
02:57:38 I try to stay out of the drama, but enough was enough.
02:57:41 I'm really thankful for the bonus episode because not only was a way to dump on some really shitty
02:57:47 people, but it was also a way to share with the cast and friends on what makes the PCP community
02:57:52 worth returning to every week.
02:57:54 I don't really have much of a sign out, but I just want to tell everyone to take care of each other
02:57:59 and thank you so much.
02:58:00 Thank you, Solaru0311.
02:58:01 We appreciate you.
02:58:02 Yeah, uh, some, yeah, some people said that they found the bonus episode very cathartic
02:58:08 and it was, it was good.
02:58:11 It was a good, uh, it was a good, uh, I, it was, it was fun.
02:58:16 I, I, I think I said on it that like, I didn't listen to the, the, the, who are these pods
02:58:22 because I knew it was just going to make me mad if I listened to it by myself.
02:58:26 But listening to it with you and Simsie and like talking about it as we went, it, it was,
02:58:32 I mean, some parts of it made me a little mad, but most of it was like, uh, it was right,
02:58:37 righteous fury that I was then able to like immediately dissipate in a, in a, in a, in a,
02:58:41 in a more helpful way, uh, as we went through it, uh, and it felt good, uh, and I liked it.
02:58:48 Uh, good, good, good times, good times.
02:58:51 Next voicemail is called, um, the, the, it's called fun fact three, two, one, go.
02:59:01 Uh, Gib, you mentioned, you watched the little prince and the eight headed dragon,
02:59:06 also known as one packu o oji no orochi taiji.
02:59:10 And you thought that the main character looked like a wind waker.
02:59:14 That's because the art director of wind waker, yoichi kotabe,
02:59:20 actually did character animation on the movie.
02:59:24 They're connected.
02:59:25 No shit, no shit.
02:59:27 Actually one to one same, same guy.
02:59:31 I, I was assuming that there was like, oh, some, some, you know, person worked on wind
02:59:36 waker, saw that movie and was inspired by, but they worked on it.
02:59:39 Well, okay.
02:59:40 It sounds, he said, he says he did character animation.
02:59:43 So it sounds like it's not like it's the same guy came up with both designs.
02:59:48 It sounds like this guy, yeah, he worked under the movie, like a cleanup or whatever.
02:59:53 Well, no, probably not cleanup.
02:59:55 Animation.
02:59:55 Well, I don't actually, I don't know.
02:59:56 Maybe I assume, um, I assume he was drawing.
02:59:59 So it, yeah, like he, yeah.
03:00:01 So he, um, I have, I have an interesting factoid for you guys.
03:00:06 So this just reminded me of what's up.
03:00:09 Um, so I was on a show about, uh, reading axed shown and jump manga and talking about them.
03:00:17 And I read one called Boki-san.
03:00:19 Have you heard of it?
03:00:20 Probably not.
03:00:20 It ran for 18 chapters before getting axed.
03:00:24 Uh, but I looked up the artist and found out that, uh, he is, uh, completely stopped
03:00:31 working with shown and jump.
03:00:32 And he is now a VTuber and draws Hentai.
03:00:39 That's kind of funny, I guess.
03:00:40 Yeah.
03:00:40 I mean, I've, I've manga artist.
03:00:43 You know what, then a manga artist starts VTubing.
03:00:46 You know, I mean, I guess it doesn't sound that crazy, but it's funny.
03:00:49 Well, a lot of like, um, like manga artists or like, uh, anime artists start off from
03:00:55 Hentai, or I know that's like a common thing, right?
03:00:57 Yeah, that's why it's funny that he went from actually working for shown and jump.
03:01:03 And his first anime and manga he made was actually really successful too.
03:01:08 I guess he wanted to go indie, I guess so.
03:01:11 But it's still like, whoa, what?
03:01:14 It's funny.
03:01:17 I think it's kind of cool.
03:01:18 It's kind of cool.
03:01:19 I was like, fuck, fuck, I don't want to work for, I don't want to work for this company anymore.
03:01:22 I just want to do my own thing.
03:01:23 I really think I respect it.
03:01:25 Yeah.
03:01:27 Um, next voicemail is called, uh, Rainforest Be Damned.
03:01:32 Three, two, one, go.
03:01:35 Hey Gib.
03:01:36 I was curious why you were talking about how you're concerned about the
03:01:40 environmental damage that NFTs cause when you have bought and sold bitcoin
03:01:45 and Ben still does it and you guys talk about it all the time.
03:01:49 Because that's the same thing.
03:01:51 Thoughts?
03:01:52 Yeah.
03:01:53 Um, well, I have since sold all of my crypto and I haven't bought anymore.
03:01:58 I also have done that.
03:01:59 I haven't bought any in a while.
03:02:02 It's, uh, the, the, the hypocrisy is not lost on me.
03:02:06 Yeah.
03:02:07 I, I, I know that it's, it's just one of those, um, well, yeah, I don't know.
03:02:14 I, I've, I've, I'm not doing it anymore.
03:02:15 Okay.
03:02:16 So I guess my conscience is clean.
03:02:17 Okay.
03:02:17 Now, I'm, now I, I'm on record as not really knowing that much about it.
03:02:21 I thought that the majority of the environmental damage came from the mining of bitcoin.
03:02:29 I know that it does take energy to do transactions as well.
03:02:32 It mostly.
03:02:33 I thought it was the, I thought it was the mining that like the, the creation of them.
03:02:37 That was the big problem.
03:02:38 Not as much the, the transfer.
03:02:40 As far as I'm aware, it comes mostly from, uh, creating.
03:02:45 So like, uh, Indy, like, like, uh, like mining, uh, you have to get so many more hard drives out.
03:02:52 So, so the, you know, making that also fucks up the environment.
03:02:57 And then, um, also like the mining itself takes up so much power that they have to
03:03:04 That's what I'm saying.
03:03:04 Yeah.
03:03:05 Get more resources.
03:03:06 And then, uh, and then like, um, what is it, then the transfer.
03:03:11 Yeah.
03:03:12 It's like, I'd actually argue it's, uh, significantly less bad.
03:03:17 Uh, for the sole reason that mining bitcoin is, you're basically solving very complex
03:03:22 math problems through brute force.
03:03:25 And what do you mean it's less bad?
03:03:27 What's less bad than one?
03:03:28 Well, it's less bad because of the fact that because it's.
03:03:32 No, what are you, what are you talking about?
03:03:33 What is less bad than one?
03:03:34 I'm making my point.
03:03:35 No, you have to tell me what you're talking about.
03:03:38 I'm talking about bitcoin is less bad than other crypto.
03:03:42 Okay.
03:03:43 Environment wise.
03:03:43 And that is because when you're mining bitcoin, it is because it's brute forcing,
03:03:48 solving a math equation.
03:03:50 There's always a chance you can get lucky and you could solve it, you know, in a millisecond.
03:03:54 And then that's it.
03:03:55 You mind the bitcoin.
03:03:57 Now that is extremely, extremely, extremely rare.
03:04:00 But because that chance exists, I don't care.
03:04:03 I don't care about this.
03:04:04 I don't care about what you're talking about right now.
03:04:07 The thing was like the comparison with NFTs to crypto currencies.
03:04:12 No, that's not what the, that's not what the question was about.
03:04:16 The question was, the question was, you criticize society and yet you live in it.
03:04:21 No, the question was, you say crypto has an environmental impact and yet you did some of it.
03:04:26 And yeah, I did.
03:04:28 And yeah, the transfer probably did have an energy cost that was not good for the environment.
03:04:32 That's probably true.
03:04:33 My understanding is that it is the creation of them that is the worst part,
03:04:37 more than the transfer.
03:04:38 But the transfer is probably also bad.
03:04:40 And I don't know, fucking.
03:04:43 Well, yeah, okay.
03:04:44 The thing I was going to say.
03:04:45 I wish crypto didn't exist.
03:04:47 I wish we lived in a world where there was no crypto.
03:04:48 But since we do, I don't know, you know, I don't know.
03:04:51 If I thought tomorrow that crypto is going to take off, it's going to be the only currency.
03:04:55 And if you don't have any of it, you're going to die in a Mad Max, no water hellscape.
03:04:59 Yeah, I'm sorry to say I would buy all the crypto.
03:05:02 Because I would just, you know, I want to fucking self preserve myself and survive.
03:05:08 I would do it, even though it would hurt the environment out of self preservation.
03:05:11 I'm sorry.
03:05:14 Okay.
03:05:14 I mean, sure.
03:05:17 The thing with the NFTs, the reason I harped on about that, but I didn't harp on so much about
03:05:21 crypto was I think at the time, NFTs were becoming like a thing and people were talking about them.
03:05:27 I got the sense that the transactions between like NFT ownership created
03:05:34 like such a disproportionate amount of energy that it was like not quite comparable to like
03:05:40 transferring Bitcoin around for some reason.
03:05:45 Maybe that's wrong.
03:05:46 I didn't, I looked into it enough to realize that they were stupid.
03:05:50 I can't really remember exactly all the details.
03:05:52 I really don't know.
03:05:53 But that's why I was like really bad on, really hard on NFTs.
03:05:58 And I still had Bitcoin at the time.
03:06:01 But yeah, they might, they might be at this point, I'm not interested in either.
03:06:04 They might be different in the way they work in that way.
03:06:06 I don't know.
03:06:09 Next one, we only have two more, by the way, we're almost done.
03:06:12 The next one is called NNN, three, two, one, go.
03:06:18 It's November.
03:06:19 And you know what that means.
03:06:21 It's no Nate November.
03:06:24 That's right.
03:06:25 Myself and tons of other PCP fans are taking up the challenge
03:06:29 and abstaining from nating for the entire month.
03:06:33 I'll be checking back in every week to update on my progress.
03:06:36 And Ben, there's one thing you can do to help us all out.
03:06:40 And that's to not have Nate on the podcast for the whole month.
03:06:43 And remember the saying of the no Nate movement, no Nate, yes, watch.
03:06:52 I don't think they explained what that what it actually means to no Nate November.
03:06:57 Well, I think because I remember on the stream on the stream,
03:07:00 it was like a little joke, like, ha, ha, no Nate.
03:07:02 Maybe this is different.
03:07:03 Like Nate's not going to make content.
03:07:05 Yeah, the joke on the stream was that would be no Nate November would be
03:07:08 if Nate didn't make any uploads.
03:07:11 But this seems to be don't watch any Nate content.
03:07:15 So I solemnly pledge, I solemnly pledge,
03:07:19 never put Nate on the podcast for no Nate November.
03:07:22 It would be it would be breaking no Nate November.
03:07:24 If we let Nate be on the podcast.
03:07:29 Either way, I'm going to be doing not November.
03:07:33 Yeah, just just just not November.
03:07:37 No, just not that's also same thing.
03:07:41 Same thing.
03:07:43 Uh, last voicemail is called.
03:07:46 This is the jumble of random letters.
03:07:48 Okay, three, two, one, go.
03:07:52 Welcome to the pro procrastinators voicemail,
03:07:55 where I say positive things about the procrastinators because gosh,
03:07:58 round you've earned it.
03:07:59 Yay, Ben excited to see your game come out and excited to see what comes up after.
03:08:04 Thanks, kid.
03:08:05 We'll have all the work you've done in the past and excited to see you keep creating today.
03:08:09 Calm, you're minding me about myself the way you source music,
03:08:12 but I'm so happy to see that you have a project going on right now that's sustainable
03:08:16 and I hope all the shit in the world goes good for you.
03:08:19 Gamers having?
03:08:21 You make puns.
03:08:22 I fucking love puns.
03:08:24 So good.
03:08:25 I am so excited.
03:08:27 I'm so excited to continue to work on Phantom's Revenge.
03:08:30 And I feel like I'm so close to being finished that I hate that I'm angry that it's Halloween today
03:08:36 because that means I have to go out and do stuff.
03:08:39 I would rather just stay home and fucking code.
03:08:44 You know, one thing about Halloween, this Halloween that I hadn't really considered until
03:08:51 my dad said it earlier today was that is that COVID, right?
03:08:57 People go into people's doors.
03:08:59 Yeah.
03:08:59 Who knows what those kids have?
03:09:03 Oh, I mean.
03:09:03 They could deliver COVID right to us.
03:09:05 Oh, that's kind of true.
03:09:07 I mean, yeah, I guess it's true that it could be a vector for infection.
03:09:12 Yeah.
03:09:14 Because it's like a weird thing like kids aren't getting vaccinated or they can't get the vaccine
03:09:18 or something.
03:09:20 I mean, you can still spread COVID even if you have the vaccine.
03:09:24 Even if you're vaccinated, you could potentially give it to some neighbor.
03:09:28 I just think I'm pretty sure a lot of people are just going to leave bowls out,
03:09:32 you know, on the door, like on the like porch or whatever.
03:09:35 Yeah, we might.
03:09:35 I'm not sure yet.
03:09:36 That's what I'm doing, just, you know, just to make it easier.
03:09:41 And also, if I was a parent, I would be like, yeah, you're not going up to the fucking doors.
03:09:45 You're not talking to any of those people because of COVID.
03:09:49 Maybe.
03:09:50 Yeah, I think it's fair.
03:09:51 Or a lot of cousins are going to have masks in them.
03:09:55 Yeah.
03:09:56 I would go out and get shitfaced tonight.
03:09:59 However, I got shitfaced last night on Lumia's birthday stream.
03:10:02 So that's very responsible of you keeping it to once, however long.
03:10:09 Once in a blue.
03:10:10 Not not not on consecutive nights.
03:10:12 That's that's disaster.
03:10:14 I trust me getting wasted multiple nights in a row is not a is not a good way to live.
03:10:20 It's a good way to like delete the next day.
03:10:23 It's a good way to stop living.
03:10:26 It is.
03:10:26 It really is.
03:10:28 Yeah.
03:10:29 Um, well, that was the last voicemail.
03:10:33 Oh, we're over three hours.
03:10:36 Eleazar hates it when we go over three hours.
03:10:39 Love you, Eleazar.
03:10:42 Fuck you, Eleazar.
03:10:45 Any any anything else to say before we wrap up?
03:10:50 Uh, go check out Clarissa Gunsmoke on my website, my comic.
03:10:55 If you haven't already, give and take that site.
03:11:00 And, uh, look out for a secret reveal at some point in the next few months.
03:11:06 That's what I'll say for now.
03:11:08 Oh, I think I know.
03:11:09 I think I know what it is.
03:11:11 But I also won't say.
03:11:13 Be sure or will I know?
03:11:15 Unless no, no, I must.
03:11:19 Be sure to check out Shreddit.
03:11:20 You know, we're a fun little quirky show.
03:11:23 Be sure to check out Advil's video on Daft Pina.
03:11:25 It will be out by the time you hear this.
03:11:27 Hopefully in the description, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
03:11:30 Okay.
03:11:31 Okay.
03:11:31 If it's out by then, hopefully it'll be out by then.
03:11:33 We'll put a link in the description to Shreddit and Advil's Daft Pina video.
03:11:39 Hell yeah.
03:11:40 Hell yeah.
03:11:42 Thank you guys.
03:11:44 Uh, no problem.
03:11:46 And, uh, buy road to Radcon.
03:11:50 Check my pin tweet.
