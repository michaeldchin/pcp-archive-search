00:00:00 Let me tell you a little story about an audience member.
00:00:27 The worst kind of audience member, the one that every creator fears the most.
00:00:33 If you're a creative, this story will be an absolute nightmare, a torturous tale from
00:00:42 your worst, your scariest dreams.
00:00:45 It's about a friend that I used to have back in high school.
00:00:50 We'll call him D for the sake of this story.
00:00:54 Now this guy, he had a really interesting taste in art, because most of what he liked
00:01:03 was great stuff, and yet, I could tell he had no fucking idea what was great about it,
00:01:13 and would completely misinterpret the intentions or just consume things in such a way that
00:01:19 would make someone like me very frustrated.
00:01:22 You know, I guess it's fair if you're enjoying yourself than whatever, but like, for some
00:01:27 of us, especially creative people, this is an absolute nightmare.
00:01:31 This guy, his favorite video game series was Metal Gear Solid.
00:01:37 He would skip the cutscenes.
00:01:39 The first time he played through Metal Gear Solid 4, the first time he played through
00:01:44 it, he skipped all the cutscenes.
00:01:48 Now Metal Gear Solid is a game that's mostly known for its story, for its cutscenes.
00:01:53 I mean, the gameplay is important as well, but the story is like what people really come
00:01:58 to it for, and the thing about it is that it's not like he was one of these guys who
00:02:04 says, I don't care about the story.
00:02:07 He would insist that he did know the story.
00:02:11 He would insist that he could follow the story.
00:02:14 He would insist that he knew everything about Metal Gear, and that he was a big fan of the
00:02:18 game series.
00:02:20 But if you ever, you know, if you asked him, like, oh, you know, have you really watched
00:02:26 the cutscenes in the other games, he'd say yes, but then if you were to ask him specific
00:02:30 details, he'd always be off, but he'd never admit he was off, he'd just be like, you'd
00:02:35 correct him, and he'd be like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's how it was, you know.
00:02:39 And he seemed to have no self-awareness about this at all.
00:02:42 He was an absolute nightmare.
00:02:44 You know, he was a huge fan of Ghost in the Shell, and just based on, I mean, I know the
00:02:50 guy.
00:02:51 I know there's no way he understands half of what's good about Ghost in the Shell.
00:02:56 Like, he just likes it because of the aesthetic and because the major is hot, you know, and
00:03:02 he just likes that sort of military action kind of story.
00:03:08 But I'm almost certain he doesn't really get any of the deeper philosophical implications
00:03:13 of the show.
00:03:14 You can enjoy whatever you like, but this is also the kind of guy who would complain
00:03:19 about stories where his complaints are obviously based on misconceptions because he wasn't
00:03:26 paying attention.
00:03:28 But he would never, like, he would say something like, you know, oh, that movie was really
00:03:32 stupid, you know, and you'd be like, why, and you'd be like, oh, it's just dumb.
00:03:37 But you could tell, like, he would insist that it was a bad movie, even though if you
00:03:41 ever watch a movie with him, he never pays attention.
00:03:44 He sits there on his fucking PSP through most movies, he talks through movies, you know,
00:03:49 he doesn't pay any attention to movies.
00:03:51 But then he'll go and talk about them as though he's seen them and insist that he was paying
00:03:56 attention.
00:03:57 This guy would just insist that he followed what was going on, you know, at one point
00:04:02 I'd loaned him my Boogie Pop novels, and he read them, and he said he liked them, and
00:04:09 I told him, like, well, you know, with Boogie Pop and others, the first book, you kind of
00:04:14 have to read it more than once to really get the full picture, you know, because I asked
00:04:17 him, like, did you understand all of it?
00:04:19 Because you kind of have to read it again before you're going to totally understand
00:04:22 what's happening.
00:04:23 He was like, no, no, no, I understood it all, you know, I got it.
00:04:27 And I was just like, how do you even fucking know that if you haven't read it the second
00:04:31 time?
00:04:32 Because it's not until you read it again that you realize what you don't know.
00:04:36 I loaned him Boogie Pop at Phantom, the TV series, and he said that he really enjoyed
00:04:42 it, but he skipped one episode, and I was like, why?
00:04:47 And he said, I just didn't want to watch that one.
00:04:50 And the one he indicated when he pointed at the box was like one of the most important
00:04:54 episodes in terms of understanding the fucking story of Boogie Pop Phantom.
00:04:59 And I was just like, how can you be this way?
00:05:04 Now the reason I bring this up is that that guy, D, will never speak to any of the people
00:05:13 who created any of those things.
00:05:15 You know, he'll never talk to Hideo Kojima, he'll never speak to Kohei Kodono, he'll
00:05:22 never speak to Masamune Shiro.
00:05:27 You know, he's never going to talk to the creators of those things and bewilder them
00:05:32 with the fact that he paid so little attention.
00:05:35 You know, he'll never be able to criticize the shows based on false information that
00:05:41 is the result of his not paying attention to what he was watching.
00:05:47 I on the other hand, will frequently interact with everyone who watches my videos.
00:05:55 And I can tell when some people did not pay any fucking attention.
00:06:02 And then they complain on the basis of misunderstood information.
00:06:08 Now it's weird for me, I think it's a little weird, it comes off a little weird even to
00:06:13 me when I talk about my videos as art.
00:06:17 Because my videos feel so direct, like to people who get them, you know, you watch it
00:06:22 and I'm just kind of explaining a point, right?
00:06:26 Like how could that be, how could there be a boogie and pop skill for that?
00:06:30 Cause I always make that comparison that like, you know, on some level you come to the audience
00:06:35 and on some level the audience comes to you, right?
00:06:38 And it's like if the whole audience doesn't understand, it means that I didn't dumb down
00:06:42 the point enough.
00:06:44 And to a lot of my viewers, it seems like how could it be more dumbed down, you know?
00:06:50 But I do write with a stylistic flourish.
00:06:55 I like my videos to make a point in a fun and succinct way.
00:06:59 I like writing in this sort of cheeky, kind of pseudo collegiate intellectual way, but
00:07:08 not in a way that's like using big words and fancy language so much as, I like when I get
00:07:15 to the point in a kind of a, like an aha moment or like a gotcha almost.
00:07:23 So referring to my latest video, the hiding sex appeal of anime in plain sight, the first
00:07:31 half of the video is me like deconstructing the idea that there's a fan service in, or
00:07:36 presenting the idea rather, I don't know why I said deconstructing, presenting the idea
00:07:40 that there's fan service in Flying Witch and Amanchu, you know?
00:07:45 And I'm talking about how no one's really criticized it and that's interesting.
00:07:49 Now if you're an inattentive viewer and you don't, you haven't made it to the end of the
00:07:55 episode but you're already, you already think you know what the video is about, then you
00:08:01 start making assumptions that I'm criticizing these shows for having fan service.
00:08:07 But that never happens.
00:08:08 The whole point of it is a build up.
00:08:10 It's alluring you into this idea but then the point of the video is at the end of the
00:08:16 video.
00:08:17 The point of the video is when I have this sort of aha reveal that like the reason this
00:08:21 is interesting is because of what it says about how people think of fan service, you
00:08:28 know, how this is not really more mature than nudity and how that's a conversation that
00:08:33 I think would be interesting to have.
00:08:36 But if you're not paying attention to the fucking video or you don't make it to the
00:08:40 end or you don't consider the whole point of it all at once, then you won't get it.
00:08:47 And I could write the video differently.
00:08:49 I could write it with clarifications up the fucking ass.
00:08:52 I could make the whole video by the way, I'm not saying fan service is bad even though
00:08:57 I say that in the video, you know, but I say it in a way where I say, you know, if you
00:09:01 ask me to step up to bat for a show that's blatant about its fan service, I'll show up
00:09:06 to the plate with a road sign like Shizuo.
00:09:09 That sentence will go right over a lot of people's heads.
00:09:14 What the fuck does that mean?
00:09:15 Some people don't know what it means to step up to bat.
00:09:18 Some people don't know, I just don't get it at all.
00:09:22 You know, I could have dumbed it down.
00:09:24 I could have said every, you know, stopped every sentence and made my point very clear.
00:09:31 But that's not how I want to write.
00:09:33 I like videos that have this kind of cheeky aha nature to them.
00:09:39 You know, my writing style is heavily influenced by ghost lightning who wrote like that.
00:09:44 Like a lot of his posts were like that, you know, he loved that video and I'm not surprised
00:09:49 because it's the kind of thing he would have written about in the same way he would have
00:09:52 written about it.
00:09:53 It's a very ghost lightning video and granted he would have probably had less defensiveness
00:10:01 over fan service even than I would have or less willingness to be defensive of shows
00:10:06 like Seiko and No Quasar.
00:10:10 But yeah, like, and only because he has less reason to, he's not as interested as I am
00:10:15 in those shows.
00:10:18 But you know, that's the style I like writing in.
00:10:21 But then the problem is that I also like reading comments and so I kind of have damned myself
00:10:29 because I'm going to have to read the comments of the people who don't pay attention, you
00:10:33 know, and the same thing happened with the Kill La Kill video and I made a whole clarification
00:10:37 video after that just because it was driving me fucking crazy.
00:10:40 And I'm tempted to do it with the Flying Witch video.
00:10:43 I'm tempted to make a clarification thing, but then I have to take a step back and be
00:10:46 like, hold on, you know, the reason you didn't write this dumbed down is because it's not
00:10:52 about the audience.
00:10:54 It's about what I wanted the video to be, you know, it's not about the mass appeal.
00:10:59 That's why I'm a boogie pop guy.
00:11:02 You know, that's why I say that.
00:11:03 Even though people might look at my videos and think, well, is this really like an artistic
00:11:07 statement?
00:11:08 Like what's so, you're just like describing what's in a show.
00:11:11 Yeah, but you know, even then there's a level of abstraction there of, you know, writing
00:11:20 with the expectation that the audience will pay full attention and watch the whole video
00:11:24 before they come to any conclusions.
00:11:26 And even some people who I can tell are fans of me and, you know, and wanted to understand
00:11:32 the point didn't quite get it.
00:11:33 And I had, I had a lot of conversations like on Twitter and other places with people who
00:11:37 just they seem to have gotten out of it.
00:11:41 Like what they like, like, like at some point in the video, they thought, well, now I get
00:11:47 the point and then, you know, didn't listen to the whole thing.
00:11:53 Like my videos have to be consumed as a whole entity.
00:11:56 There is no like, there's nothing you can break off of it and it'll still make sense
00:12:01 as a whole.
00:12:02 You know, it's why the Astroscore sucks is so misunderstood by people who don't watch
00:12:08 the whole thing.
00:12:09 You know, people who watch like little bits and pieces of it and like, he's just trashing
00:12:12 some show.
00:12:13 It's like, yeah, there's always a greater point to why I built up to this, to this ending.
00:12:18 You know, the video is a complete piece of work.
00:12:21 It's not just a string of random ideas.
00:12:24 I get why people think that way because so much of what's out there, so many videos are
00:12:29 just formulaic, you know, strings of fucking comments on things that are all taken at face
00:12:36 value, that don't have a greater point they're getting to in the end, you know, and I, if
00:12:43 I just had written the video in such a way, like if I just reversed it, you know, if I
00:12:47 reversed the point, made it very explicit in the beginning, what my point is about to
00:12:52 be and then explained the point, then more people would have understood where I was coming
00:12:59 from.
00:13:00 But it doesn't have that same flavor to it of the fun aha moment that comes at the end
00:13:06 of this build up, you know, it's, it's more dramatic the way I write it because I want
00:13:11 it, I want it to feel cool, you know, I don't want to just fucking describe something.
00:13:17 I don't want a drab analysis of something.
00:13:20 You know, there's a reason I would never write in the style of like Matthew Matosis
00:13:24 and not to say that I don't like his style, it's fun to watch his videos, but they're
00:13:28 very much a cut and dry start from the beginning, work your way through, describe every single
00:13:35 thing, you know, make the point very abundantly clear from the beginning and I would never
00:13:41 be able to write in that style and I don't like it as much, you know, I really prefer
00:13:46 like a Mr. B tongue video where he deliberately strings you along and keeps like hinting at
00:13:51 you that maybe you're going to get to see the point, but you really got to make it through
00:13:55 all this other stuff, you know, and then when he finally brings it all back, it's tight
00:13:59 and impactful, you know, and it's a lot harder to like rewatch a Matthew Matosis video than
00:14:06 it is to rewatch a Mr. B tongue video or one of my videos I'd like to think, you know,
00:14:11 I write them in a way that's meant to be re-consumable, that they're meant to stand
00:14:16 alone as articles that are interesting, that you reread multiple times and that are engaging
00:14:23 on their own, it's not just what I'm talking about that's interesting, it's the way I'm
00:14:28 talking about it that's interesting.
00:14:30 That's why those are the videos that, you know, that I mark on Patreon that I feel proud
00:14:34 enough of to try to make money off of it, because to me, that's more of an artistic
00:14:40 video, and that's why I love writing so much, but you know, if a lot of people are going
00:14:49 to misunderstand it and like at some point I have to decide, do I want to, you know,
00:14:57 just make another fucking video, re-clarifying the points just so that the discussion will
00:15:02 be better, or do I want to just like ignore the discussion like a normal artist would,
00:15:08 you know, because most artists are not dealing with this problem, most people don't have
00:15:14 to hear from D, they don't have to hear him talk about their work and be just bombarded
00:15:22 with the knowledge that they didn't pay attention, you know, and then get so bothered by it that
00:15:27 they feel the need to clarify again and explain their own art, most people don't have to explain
00:15:32 their own art, you know, and yet somehow I keep finding myself in that position and
00:15:37 it doesn't help that my art is basically explaining art, you know, so it's kind of
00:15:43 cyclical.
00:15:44 There's a reason I don't send my videos to the people who make the shows, you know,
00:15:49 because even though I feel like I get it, I don't, you know, it's just all opinions,
00:15:53 it's just, it's its own thing, it's not even relative to the artist's intention and I'm
00:16:01 sure there's a few artists I've talked about their work who would absolutely hate me if
00:16:05 they had to watch one of my videos, you know, but um, yeah, that's the sort of suffering
00:16:12 that I feel in the comments sometimes.
00:16:15 And so without further ado, just to clarify, that video was not criticizing fan service
00:16:23 nor was it criticizing the fan service in those shows except for the fact that clingy
00:16:28 clothes bother me personally.
00:16:32 It was a criticism of the way that people talk about fan service and how people don't
00:16:38 seem to appreciate that these shows are blatantly featuring the most attractive characters and
00:16:43 putting them in the most attractive outfits because that's appealing, you know, and how
00:16:50 it's funny to me that that's not criticized as immature in the way that showing tits would
00:16:55 be even though it's basically the same thing.
00:16:58 That's the point of the video.
00:16:59 For anybody who didn't get it, who might be listening to this now, um, I doubt that's
00:17:04 too many of you.
00:17:06 Oh God, alright.
00:17:09 This was actually a real decompression, uh, issue, so glad this show still exists.
00:17:19 Maybe this whole decompression chamber podcast is gonna stick around for longer than I, uh,
00:17:24 just thought because man, I've gotten to a point that I almost need it.
00:17:30 Today I had a moment early this morning that was so powerful in making me want to talk
00:17:38 about it on the decompression chamber that it's had me anxious all day.
00:17:41 It's Christmas Day as I'm recording this.
00:17:44 I, um, I had planned to spend Christmas with my parents, get drunk all night and spend
00:17:51 the night at their house.
00:17:52 I ended up going a day early and doing that the day before, um, so I was there Christmas
00:17:58 Eve night, woke up on Christmas, you know, hung out with them, um, felt weird all morning
00:18:05 for reasons I'll get into later, read this comment that really set me off and I really
00:18:10 wanted to decompress about it, um, but I ended up being there till 10 at night, finally drove
00:18:15 home, um, and I'm gonna talk about it.
00:18:20 I don't, it's hard to know where to start with this, but I'm gonna start by explaining
00:18:24 something, a concept I came up with a couple of months ago.
00:18:27 I don't remember if I've talked about this anywhere, but if I have, I'm sorry.
00:18:32 It's called the good person fallacy, fallacy, if you will.
00:18:38 I know I say it wrong, because you know there's all these, uh, argument fallacies that people
00:18:42 talk about.
00:18:43 There's one that, that I find comes up all the time, which is the fallacy that the opponent
00:18:50 in your argument is trying to present themselves, present themselves as a good person.
00:18:57 Because that's not something I try to do.
00:19:00 I don't believe myself to be a great person.
00:19:03 I'm not a bad person, but I don't believe myself to be a great person.
00:19:07 I don't believe very many people to be great people.
00:19:10 You know, to me, being a good person is, is b- like, okay.
00:19:17 You know, good and bad, like, most of us are 6 out of 10 people.
00:19:23 Let's put it that way.
00:19:24 You know?
00:19:25 If you're a good person, you gotta be a 7 or 8.
00:19:28 You gotta be putting a little effort in.
00:19:30 You know?
00:19:31 You gotta be greasing the fire of the good person, you know?
00:19:36 And bad people are, are, you know, doing something real wrong, basically.
00:19:41 Fundamentally, something's broken.
00:19:44 I don't think I'm a good person.
00:19:45 I think I'm like a 6 or 7 out of 10, you know, really depending on who you ask.
00:19:50 In terms of moral quality.
00:19:52 Maybe even a 5.
00:19:53 I actually might be a 5 out of 10.
00:19:55 Or maybe lower.
00:19:56 It really depends on who you ask.
00:19:59 Uh, you know, I think to be considered a, a good or great person, you have to be a
00:20:06 good person.
00:20:07 You have to be someone who's self-sacrificing and helpful and kind and, you know, having
00:20:13 the qualities of a good, a good individual.
00:20:17 I don't have a lot of that.
00:20:18 You know, I have it, maybe I have it more than a lot of people.
00:20:22 Um, I, I have a lot of empathy.
00:20:25 I understand other people pretty easily.
00:20:27 I feel a lot for other people.
00:20:30 I don't do a lot for other people.
00:20:32 I feel a lot more than I do, you know?
00:20:35 I feel really bad about all the hardships in the world.
00:20:37 I don't do a lot to help them.
00:20:39 I, I've, uh, often said I have a Ruroni Kenshin policy when it comes to helping people, which
00:20:46 is I help the people I can see.
00:20:48 The ones who are right in front of me.
00:20:50 The ones who I understand their situation and what needs to be done to help it.
00:20:55 You know, I don't give to charity.
00:20:58 I don't try to help out on a global scale or anything like that.
00:21:02 And there are people out there who do those things.
00:21:04 Those are great people.
00:21:06 You know, my dad is a much better person than me.
00:21:10 He does a lot for charity.
00:21:13 He does a lot for helping people.
00:21:15 You know, he gives a lot of both time and energy and money and love and care.
00:21:19 He gives all that.
00:21:21 I don't give that.
00:21:22 I'm not a great person like my dad, you know?
00:21:25 And when I get into an argument with someone, I'm not trying to prove that I'm great.
00:21:33 I'm not trying to prove that I'm morally righteous.
00:21:36 I'm just trying to prove what I think, you know?
00:21:40 I'm just trying to state how I feel on the matter and support my claims and make you
00:21:45 understand how I feel.
00:21:47 It's not about convincing you that I'm right or good.
00:21:50 It's just about convincing you that I understand my own position sort of.
00:21:56 So this also, you know, this sounds a lot like my usual moral, my objectivity versus
00:22:03 subjectivity arguments.
00:22:04 It's very similar.
00:22:05 I feel the same way about morals, you know?
00:22:08 And I've been described as a moral relativist by some people.
00:22:14 I don't know how much I agree with that though.
00:22:17 It's not that I think, I mean, yeah, there's no objective standard of morals because that's
00:22:21 fucking ridiculous, that mere idea.
00:22:24 But you can have a pretty clear consensus on what's good and bad, right?
00:22:31 My version is anything that brings you closer to life is good.
00:22:35 Anything that brings you closer to death is bad.
00:22:39 If what you're doing has a net gain for humanity, it's good.
00:22:42 If what you're doing is a net gain for humanity, that's negative, it's bad.
00:22:45 And you know, you can never predict what it's actually gonna be.
00:22:49 There's no way to actually like predict what effect, you know, what ripple effect your actions
00:22:54 will have.
00:22:55 But on a case-by-case basis, we can say like, you shoot a guy, that's bad.
00:22:58 You know, you do something that endangers people, that's bad.
00:23:02 You do something that helps people, that's good.
00:23:04 I think that's pretty clear.
00:23:05 I think that's pretty fucking cut and dry and nobody's gonna disagree with it, you know?
00:23:09 So yeah, I do have a standard of what I think is good or bad morally.
00:23:16 I just don't hold myself to that standard.
00:23:20 I don't go out of my way to paint myself as a good person, nor do I think of most people
00:23:25 as good people.
00:23:26 You know, like, it's not that I think of myself as worse than most.
00:23:31 I think there's probably a lot of people who think they're good, who I would disagree
00:23:35 with them on that.
00:23:37 Because the way I see it, every resource we use, you know, is a resource we're not giving
00:23:43 to someone else.
00:23:45 You know, someone who needs it, doesn't have it and we're using it and we don't need it.
00:23:51 That's a thing that is just, that's a part of Western society right there.
00:23:55 If we gave up our conveniences and used those to help the impoverished, we'd have a lot
00:24:02 fewer impoverished and we don't do it because, and for good reason, we wouldn't be happy
00:24:08 if we did it.
00:24:09 You know, we're not raised in such a way, we don't have such a mindset to make us people
00:24:12 who can do that.
00:24:14 There are people who can do that out there.
00:24:16 Those are great people, but you know, they're not great because they made this unbelievable
00:24:22 decision to be great.
00:24:25 They're great because they have the state of mind to be great.
00:24:28 They're people who, you know, were raised in a certain way and have a certain set of
00:24:33 beliefs that leads them to do great things.
00:24:38 But that's not me and that's not most people.
00:24:41 I wrote about this in my song, Seeth, you know, I'd be hard pressed to name two guys
00:24:47 that I like unqualified or any that I find to be good, as I say, said in those lyrics.
00:24:53 A lot of these thoughts, a lot of these kinds of thoughts are more present in my song lyrics
00:24:57 than they are in any of my writing or podcasting and stuff like that because I tend to get
00:25:02 out more of my anger and vitriol towards humanity out in my music.
00:25:10 But I have to talk about this and this boils down to really my sub versus dub video I did,
00:25:21 my video about my stance on dubs on multiple levels.
00:25:26 I almost responded to this when I talked in that last section where I was talking about
00:25:30 comments, but I forgot to get to this because I got a certain accusation a number of times
00:25:36 on that video of being very biased and unfair and ignorant about the dubbing industry.
00:25:43 And when I got those comments, all I could think was, well, yeah, this is not a review
00:25:50 of the dubbing industry.
00:25:53 This is my stance on dubs that I somehow still haven't made a video about.
00:25:58 I never said my stance on dubs was not ignorant.
00:26:02 I never said it was fair and balanced.
00:26:06 I never said I'd done research.
00:26:08 Never said I had any investment in the dub industry.
00:26:12 I don't give a fuck about dubs.
00:26:14 I don't even like dubs or respect dubs as I said at the beginning of the video, you
00:26:18 know, some there are some people who said they turned off right there and I'm like fair
00:26:23 enough, you know, I don't like or respect dubs didn't say I was going to be fair about
00:26:30 it.
00:26:31 So that's part of the criticism.
00:26:33 Now I also wanted to talk about this because there's a part in the video where I say that
00:26:37 I hate Vic Minyona both as an actor and as a person and I got a bunch of questions like
00:26:42 asking why why do you hate Vic Minyona?
00:26:46 And I real quickly realized I can't answer all of those and this is one of the difficulties
00:26:50 of doing videos is that I feel like I constantly have to re clarify and explain things.
00:26:56 Every little thing I say I have to then make another video about or make a thousand comments
00:27:02 explaining it and at this point I was like, I don't like a lot of the times it's something
00:27:06 I don't care that much about, you know, I just said it as a one off line in a video.
00:27:11 I don't want to have to go and explain.
00:27:13 I'm not that invested in my hatred of Vic Minyona.
00:27:17 I just think it's really funny because I think he's a douchebag and I hate his acting,
00:27:21 you know, which really should be enough of a reason to hate the guy because he sucks
00:27:26 at acting and I don't like him.
00:27:30 I've hated people for less.
00:27:33 So I was answering people on my Reddit board who asked, you know, I explained myself.
00:27:40 I said, well, he's a weird Christian fundamentalist who has said at a panel before that he doesn't
00:27:48 think that Edward Elric is actually an atheist even though in Japanese Edward Elric literally
00:27:53 says I'm an atheist.
00:27:56 They changed that line in the dub, possibly as a result of him not being comfortable with
00:28:01 it.
00:28:02 That to me is more than enough reason to hate the guy, you know, I don't know him.
00:28:06 I don't care about him.
00:28:08 Maybe he's a nice guy.
00:28:09 I don't fucking care.
00:28:10 Still hate him.
00:28:11 You know, it's not about whether he's a good person or even whether he's a better person
00:28:16 than me.
00:28:17 It's just about what pisses me off.
00:28:19 That pisses me off.
00:28:20 He refused to sign a picture of his character from Free like making out with another guy.
00:28:27 I was like some Yaoi fan art and he wouldn't sign it because, you know, it just made him
00:28:31 uncomfortable, whatever.
00:28:33 Fuck him.
00:28:34 Fuck that guy.
00:28:35 Fuck him for being uncomfortable about some gay shit, you know.
00:28:40 Fuck him for being weird, a weird 50 year old guy who dresses like a teenage heartthrob.
00:28:45 And there's there's a thousand rumors on the internet about misconduct he's had with like
00:28:50 underaged fans of his.
00:28:51 I don't know how true any of it is.
00:28:53 I've been hearing these rumors for years, forever.
00:28:56 You know, every time someone brings up Vic Mignona, someone else brings up, oh, he might
00:29:00 have molested a bunch of fucking 14 year olds or something.
00:29:05 You know, you hear something enough times, you think it's probably true, maybe it's not
00:29:08 true at all, maybe it's just a bunch of bullshit that's out there on the internet.
00:29:12 I don't give a fuck, you know.
00:29:14 Don't like the guy.
00:29:15 I'm not out to lead a smear campaign against him.
00:29:18 You know, I'm not out to ruin his career, I've just made a decision about how I feel
00:29:22 about him.
00:29:23 And I think it's funny, so I keep saying it.
00:29:26 Now I got a comment in response to this, that pissed me off on a lot of different levels.
00:29:33 And it tends to be that the comments that pissed me off the most are the ones where there's
00:29:37 some element of it that I agree with, but it's packaged in a way that I vehemently disagree
00:29:45 with.
00:29:46 They never have those people who say like, fuck you, I hate you, your content is awful,
00:29:52 and then they rant about all these different reasons they don't like you and all of it's
00:29:55 a bunch of bullshit.
00:29:56 But then there's that one nugget in there that you're like, if you had just said that
00:29:59 and you'd said it politely, we could have had a conversation about this, you know, but
00:30:04 they don't.
00:30:06 So this guy gets mad at me because he says, you know, while I don't know Vic Minyona,
00:30:13 I have, you know, talked to him through emails and stuff, and he seems like an upstanding
00:30:18 guy in a cool chill guy or whatever, and I think all those rumors about him doing all
00:30:24 that misconduct is a bunch of horseshit and like a smear campaign against him.
00:30:29 And that part, he was obviously mad at me because I was talking shit about somebody
00:30:34 without having a lot of information about him, you know, without knowing the guy.
00:30:39 And he might be an okay guy, and maybe it's fucked up for me to sling mud at people I
00:30:43 don't know.
00:30:45 That's a fair enough argument, you know, I would have been willing to have a conversation
00:30:48 about that.
00:30:49 But it was packaged in between, oh, and you're such a good person, you think you're any morally
00:30:57 superior to him, you fucking, and then he goes on about like these problems he has with
00:31:02 me and how he thought I was, I was intellectual enough to be above all this kind of stuff,
00:31:07 but you know.
00:31:09 So obviously, that part of the argument just pissed me off, so I told him to fuck off.
00:31:15 Um, I said fuck off, he said I was attacking, I said I'm not attacking Vic Minyona, okay,
00:31:20 I'm just being a dick over here on my subreddit, you know, explaining myself, I've made a statement
00:31:26 that I don't like the guy, I've explained why I don't like the guy, this is not an attack,
00:31:31 I'm not waging an internet war against fucking Vic Minyona, you know, there's a reason I
00:31:36 didn't make a video about this, I don't want to go around spreading rumors about insinuations,
00:31:41 it's just what I've heard, and I have no reason to doubt it, I don't have any reason
00:31:46 to believe this guy just because he talked to him in a couple emails that he suddenly
00:31:49 knows what Vic fucking Minyona's like, you know, and the candor of the comment sort of
00:31:57 clued me in that this guy is probably also a Christian guy who probably likes Vic for
00:32:03 those reasons because he said that he thinks the reason that Vic gets these accusations
00:32:09 is from people who don't like that he's Christian and have a problem with his beliefs, then
00:32:14 the things he accuses me of are weirdly things that a Christian would have a problem with,
00:32:23 so I thought okay, this guy's probably defending Vic because he's sick of seeing Christians
00:32:28 get beat up on for being Christians, you know, and I get that, that's also fair, I don't
00:32:34 like Christians, don't like their belief system, don't like the fundamentalist mindset,
00:32:41 you know, I think it's a fucking willful ignorance to know scientifically why something
00:32:55 is untrue and to go on believing it anyways, it's like well, you know, it's one thing
00:33:01 if you just don't know any better, but it's a whole other thing if you've been shown
00:33:05 the evidence and you still keep going on believing what you want to believe just because, especially
00:33:09 if it affects other people, you know, when you have religious people who, you know, are
00:33:17 like uncomfortable with or have a problem with gay people because it goes against their
00:33:22 doctrine, even though their doctrine is not couched in any kind of scientific reality,
00:33:27 then that's just being a fucking willfully ignorant shitbag, you know, not saying that
00:33:33 everyone who's Christian is that, but a whole lot of them are and I don't see any reason
00:33:39 for the religion to exist, I don't see how it helps anybody for it to be around, so yeah,
00:33:46 to me, can't say I have a whole lot of respect for it, sorry if that offends you, but this
00:33:53 brings me to the next interesting thing about this comment and about being an internet content
00:33:59 creator or any content creator.
00:34:01 Well, I guess this is mostly true on the internet because most people wouldn't get to witnesses.
00:34:06 I have had these moments all throughout my career where I get to literally watch someone
00:34:12 become disillusioned with me as a human being.
00:34:16 I get to watch people go from thinking I'm good to no longer thinking I'm good, you
00:34:23 know, hearing something I've said that they find questionable and then deciding that they
00:34:28 like me less because of it and I've gotten to watch this happen a number of times and
00:34:33 it is a deeply fascinating and in some ways frightening experience because it's always
00:34:42 sad to know you've let someone down, but at the same time it's not my fault that they
00:34:49 are getting let down, you know, I can't control what they believed I was going to be or what
00:34:54 they want a person to be, you know, let's take for example, I mean, I think it's pretty
00:35:02 clear to most people who get into me that I drink a lot, you know, I've made that a
00:35:07 part of my identity, I do a show called the pub crawl, I have alcohol and all my avatars
00:35:12 and banners, I drink it on camera, I talk about it all the time, you know, I want it
00:35:17 to be clear that like, I'm a I'm a drinky guy, you know, it's a thing I do.
00:35:24 So I don't think there's a lot of people who come in and but I did see this before when
00:35:27 I first started drinking more where people started being like, you know, it makes me
00:35:32 uncomfortable that you drink so much because some people aren't comfortable with alcohol.
00:35:36 Some people aren't comfortable with this or that and it's not even always on a moral
00:35:39 level sometimes it's just on an experience level and I totally get it like when I was
00:35:43 a teenager, I was very straight laced, you know, I didn't do anything illegal.
00:35:49 And when other people did those things, I felt more disconnected from them.
00:35:53 When I heard people like talk about like all the weed they were smoking, you know, some
00:35:57 content creator talking about like weed and shit and like fetishizing it and talking
00:36:01 so much about it, it just put a little bit of distance between me and them because here
00:36:06 I was as someone who was deliberately not doing those things, you know, and then hearing
00:36:11 somebody else talk about it, it just feels alienating on some level.
00:36:15 And I understand that, but it's it's interesting to watch it happen because there's other
00:36:22 people who will be less alienated.
00:36:25 If I say something, if I go on here and talk about smoking weed, there's some people who
00:36:28 are going to be like, yes, this is exactly what I want to hear.
00:36:32 I love you more than ever before.
00:36:34 You know, please talk about this all the time.
00:36:36 It really makes me happy.
00:36:38 And there's going to be other people who are like, I'm so uncomfortable hearing you talk
00:36:42 about smoking weed that I, you know, it makes me want to tune out or I skip those parts
00:36:48 in the video.
00:36:49 You know, it's divisive subject matter and everything I talk about is divisive.
00:36:54 It's just on different levels and different different levels of people caring about it.
00:36:58 You know, it's one thing to be divisive about your opinions of anime, but it's a whole other
00:37:03 thing to be divisive on like a political or social issue that people might feel more strongly
00:37:09 about, you know, it invites a different level, especially when there's people who completely
00:37:18 agree with you on one front and then totally not on another.
00:37:21 You know, some people who are like, man, our taste in anime is exactly in sync, but the
00:37:26 way you live your life completely disgusts me, you know.
00:37:32 And it's funny when people equate the two.
00:37:35 Like this guy who left this comment, I don't know what the fuck he could have seen from
00:37:39 me that gave him the idea that I'm like this above conflict intellectual, like just because
00:37:46 I analyze anime and sound smart, I somehow am also, well, I must be like some kind of
00:37:53 fucking, I don't know, through through anti violence, anti being mean to anyone guy.
00:38:03 Not really the case, you know, I can be mean spirited.
00:38:07 I can be insulting.
00:38:08 I can be a dick.
00:38:12 I don't hold myself to that kind of high standard because I don't think I'm different
00:38:18 from most people, you know.
00:38:21 I'm not exactly trying to present myself as an amazing guy.
00:38:26 Um, again, not that I think I'm an outright supervillain or anything, but sometimes I
00:38:35 do feel like a bad guy, you know.
00:38:40 I relate to a lot of bad guys.
00:38:42 I relate a lot and I appreciate art from a lot of bad guys.
00:38:47 And that's another thing like part of the reason that I'm not willing to hide those
00:38:51 elements is that I respond well to those things.
00:38:55 I really love listening to Kanye West talk about how much of a shit person he can be,
00:39:01 you know, or a lot of rappers who rap about similar things.
00:39:05 I like, you know, I like listening to people who are outsiders who feel like they don't
00:39:13 agree with society, who feel out of place, you know, because I've always felt that way.
00:39:18 So that kind of shit resonates with me, you know, and that's the kind of stuff I want
00:39:22 to put out there.
00:39:23 I'm not out there to put on a squeaky clean image for people who want to fit in, you know,
00:39:27 it's not me.
00:39:30 So so I get to witness these things and I want to pull up this list of things that that
00:39:36 guy called me on my phone, because I found this to be a fascinating list of accusations
00:39:45 that he called me in this comment.
00:39:51 You can find this on my Reddit, by the way.
00:39:53 All right.
00:39:54 He says, he says, I don't see why he needs to continue to be personally attacked by degenerates,
00:40:03 which I never personally attacked Vic Minyona, but I find it interesting this implication
00:40:08 that I might be a degenerate, as if you or anyone else who attacks him is in any way
00:40:12 morally superior, while I certainly never claimed moral superiority to Vic Minyona.
00:40:18 As what qualifies one for virtue today are masturbating to porn and being a morally relativistic,
00:40:25 carefree libertarian who smokes the occasional blunt and voices some hate for a religious
00:40:31 person every now and then for good measure.
00:40:35 So I thought it was really interesting.
00:40:38 I'm not entirely sure if he's talking about me because some of that stuff just seems like
00:40:42 smokes the occasional blunt is such an odd out of place sentence and sentiment in here,
00:40:50 as is the masturbates to porn, really, because first of all, I've never had a blunt before.
00:40:57 I've smoked weed exactly twice in my life once a year ago and once last night, leading
00:41:05 into that as well, and I don't understand why that's coming up in an argument about
00:41:12 whether or not I'm a morally upright person because there's literally nothing wrong with
00:41:17 smoking weed.
00:41:19 But again, this is a matter of perspective.
00:41:21 For some people, if I talk about smoking weed, it's like, you know, like to them that's
00:41:27 like totally affirming, it makes me a better person, whereas others would think I'm worse.
00:41:32 Masturbating to porn, if you have a problem with that, I'm fucking sorry, but you're
00:41:35 a complete moron.
00:41:39 And then what was the other one?
00:41:41 Morally relativistic, which I already talked about, carefree libertarian.
00:41:45 I don't think I'm a libertarian.
00:41:49 I mean, I have so many socialist ideas.
00:41:52 I've said this before, I'm Aberdorf Linkler politically.
00:41:56 I completely see both sides of the issue.
00:41:58 If I'm libertarian, it's only to save my own ass, you know, it's just that like I think
00:42:02 libertarian belief systems and structures support my lifestyle better, you know, if
00:42:11 I was living in such a way that I thought socialism benefited me, I'd probably be more
00:42:18 of a socialist.
00:42:22 But that's all neither here nor there.
00:42:25 I don't consider myself a moral person.
00:42:28 I don't think I have to like people who are morally better than me, you know.
00:42:34 That is not my basis for judgment on people.
00:42:37 It's more about whether the things they do piss me off or not, you know.
00:42:45 I get a bad vibe from Vic Minyona, not a bad vibe as in he's a bad person, but a bad vibe
00:42:52 as in he does things I don't like personally.
00:42:56 So that's why I don't like him.
00:42:58 And maybe that's completely unfair and maybe I'm actually the asshole in that whole scenario.
00:43:03 I don't care if I am the asshole.
00:43:07 I am through with the notion that I am cool, as I say in the song Seath once again.
00:43:18 So I did get super duper high last night.
00:43:24 I started off normal high, which I hadn't been before.
00:43:30 It was all right.
00:43:31 I just ate everything.
00:43:33 I got the munchies super hard and ate everything in sight.
00:43:36 Then I just felt really chill and I was like, okay, this is probably the state of mind most
00:43:43 people are in who like getting high is just being chill and listening to electronic music,
00:43:48 you know.
00:43:49 Listen to Frank Jev C's volume two and then a bunch of Pogo music and it was Trill is
00:43:54 all fucked.
00:43:57 Then I got way too high and then my brain started being a thousand thoughts every second
00:44:03 and nonstop analysis of everything happening around me and things were too fucked up.
00:44:08 And then I thought it would be hilarious to watch Shrek.
00:44:12 I thought for the memes, I'll watch Shrek.
00:44:16 Well hi, that was a fucking nightmare.
00:44:20 I'm going to read you my Snapchat story.
00:44:24 If you don't follow me on Snapchat and you want to see things like this by all means
00:44:28 follow me on Snapchat.
00:44:30 My handle is digibroni after D all one word because one of my dumb ass friends made the
00:44:37 account.
00:44:38 So let me go through my story on Snapchat because I live blogged Shrek while I was watching
00:44:45 it.
00:44:46 All right, first we have feeling 840 and it happening as you can hear Smash Mouth playing.
00:44:54 Holy shit Shrek is the ugliest animated film ever made since Food Fight.
00:44:59 Every word in that sentence is spelled wrong.
00:45:03 This film is a waking nightmare of awful.
00:45:06 There is one good line in this movie.
00:45:09 This film is a cultural forced meme.
00:45:12 I am trapped in the most thorough analysis of my life.
00:45:16 To be fair there are some little but solid gems in here.
00:45:20 This scene is a Trump commentary referring to Shrek trying to build a wall around donkey.
00:45:26 This film is about convincing libertarians to be socialists or converting libertarians
00:45:31 to socialists and the nightmare is over which I should have typed ogre but you know I wasn't
00:45:38 in the best state of mind.
00:45:40 So that's my very high analysis of Shrek.
00:45:45 While I was high that was the worst movie I've ever seen.
00:45:47 The animation is like just all very stiff and shitty looking.
00:45:53 The character models are hideous, absolutely hideous.
00:45:57 Everything is very generic, low poly, it all looks like a fucking PS2 game like an early
00:46:02 PS2 game.
00:46:04 The movie just looks like dog shit as no aesthetic sensibility at all.
00:46:09 Everything is as standard and stock as it could possibly be.
00:46:15 A bunch of canned musical appearances, no cinematography at all.
00:46:24 The voice acting all sounds like it's recorded line by line.
00:46:28 Like it doesn't sound like the characters are reacting to one another.
00:46:31 Every line sounds like it was recorded multiple times and they chose a take or even constructed
00:46:36 a line from multiple takes.
00:46:40 And the music is generic.
00:46:42 The non-licensed music is generic.
00:46:45 So it's the worst movie ever according to me when I am feeling 840 as I put it.
00:46:53 So that might be a fun story for some of you and for some of you it might just sound like
00:46:56 an uncomfortable, self-destructive whatever.
00:47:02 See it's funny because I'm followed by a lot of nerdy types.
00:47:06 Nerdy types who often don't get into a lot of these things.
00:47:10 These illegal substances or substances at all.
00:47:16 People who don't drink.
00:47:19 And it's funny for me because even though I grew up super straight laced, everyone I
00:47:23 knew was super not.
00:47:25 My parents are fucking punk rock people.
00:47:28 My parents grew up going to shows constantly, smoking and drinking.
00:47:36 My dad never smoked much but he was always a big drinker when he was in his early 20s.
00:47:41 My mom smoked tons of weed with bands and shit.
00:47:46 And that's who my parents are.
00:47:50 I didn't really know that stuff growing up but my parents are fucking very loose people.
00:47:55 They swear constantly.
00:47:56 That's why I swear so much because my parents swear absolutely constantly.
00:48:00 As badly as I do.
00:48:04 And the people I knew in high school were all fucking stoners.
00:48:08 You know I was roommates with two of them at the same time.
00:48:12 They never smoked around me.
00:48:13 I never saw weed once until like last fucking Christmas the first time I even saw it.
00:48:22 I lived with two stoners.
00:48:24 They literally collected High Times Magazine.
00:48:27 A magazine about weed.
00:48:29 I guess I'd seen weed in that context.
00:48:32 But I'd read those magazines.
00:48:35 I'd sit on the toilet and read High Times or these weed books they had laying around.
00:48:42 I just grew up around a bunch of stoners and most of them had done other harder drugs and
00:48:48 drank a lot.
00:48:50 I didn't do any of that stuff but I was familiar with it.
00:48:53 So to me all that stuff is very normal.
00:48:55 It's all very like this is what everyone does.
00:48:58 I've grown up around media that represents those things.
00:49:02 I watch lots of movies where people do all kinds of drugs or listen to music that's about
00:49:07 drugs.
00:49:08 Most of the music I listen to is probably about drugs.
00:49:12 So to me that stuff all seems very natural and most of the people I know do it way more
00:49:18 than I do.
00:49:20 To people who don't drink at all I might seem like an alcoholic.
00:49:25 To an alcoholic I seem like a lightweight who barely drinks at all.
00:49:32 To people who've never smoked a cigarette I probably look like I'm addicted to cigarettes
00:49:36 which was true this past month or so but I'm quitting again but for years I smoked one
00:49:44 cigarette a day which is people who are like serious smokers.
00:49:49 My dad for 30 years smoked a pack to a pack and a half a day.
00:49:54 That's 20 in a pack by the way.
00:49:58 It's a world of difference.
00:50:00 My grandma was smoking four packs a day for most of her life.
00:50:04 She's still alive by the way.
00:50:06 She's like almost 80 and she had to quit eventually because she couldn't like she physically can't
00:50:13 even smoke anymore.
00:50:14 I did so many bad things to her lungs.
00:50:19 But yeah so to me that stuff all seems like babies first and again there's a divide in
00:50:26 the audience here.
00:50:27 Some people listening to this are going to go like yeah I know.
00:50:30 I know you don't do anything.
00:50:32 I know you're a fucking pussy baby and some people are going to be like yeah but you seem
00:50:37 like you're just a whirlwind of debauchery and nihilism which is you know I present
00:50:46 myself that way sometimes because I think it's funny but again I'm not I don't know
00:50:52 it really is a matter of perspective.
00:50:56 I've probably said that sentence 40 times now.
00:51:23 I guess to make a long story short if there's one thing I'm not interested in doing it's
00:51:29 policing myself publicly and I do it a lot more than it probably seems like I do given
00:51:36 the kind of stuff I talk talk about online just because I have very much tried to rein
00:51:42 myself in as a person who posts every fucking random thought I have because a lot of that
00:51:47 stuff is not relevant to many people and would actively make me seem like an idiot and I
00:51:55 try to avoid that because if you read my old like if you read my Twitter circa like 2008
00:52:00 or 2009 or like read my old anime blog like it was just so much unnecessary information
00:52:07 so much extraneous bullshit that didn't need to be there and you know it really made me
00:52:17 come off as like this dumb kid who was constantly shouting every thought I had and it's like
00:52:24 obnoxious to read that kind of shit even though a lot of the Twitters I follow do practically
00:52:28 the same thing you know but um so I do rein myself in because I have a lot of stupid
00:52:35 thoughts that that you know that I think for a second I should tweet and then I don't but
00:52:41 I don't want to be the kind of person who is constantly concerned about the overall
00:52:48 moral presentation of my character you know again I am a gonzo journalist because it's
00:52:55 about the experience of like what is it to be me what is it to be an otaku you know who
00:53:05 works online it's not about presenting that as a good thing it's not about presenting
00:53:11 otaku as something you want to be you know if anything I'd rather portray it more like
00:53:16 welcome to the NHK as kind of a living hell and waking nightmare you know that's not how
00:53:22 I feel my life is but it can be that and I don't want to hide those elements you know
00:53:29 and I guess I would feel better about it if there was a squeaky clean guy you know if
00:53:36 there was a version of me who who did all the same things but just was a better person
00:53:42 or maybe another guy well there's plenty of people who do the same thing as me but are like
00:53:47 you know actively more like like I see someone like endless Jess as like me with no scruples
00:53:54 about presenting myself that like you know I'm willing to go all out and just be you know the
00:54:00 monster that people want me to be in some cases now I absolutely love Jesse for that and I think
00:54:07 he's amazing for being so willing to put himself out there you know and and not be concerned about
00:54:16 trying to meet anyone's taste he does not give a fuck about your taste if anything he doesn't
00:54:22 respect you for the fact that your taste is not his you know and I think that's powerful and I
00:54:29 gravitate towards that um and on some level I because I feel like I'm such a spokesperson for
00:54:38 a lot of the ideas I'm talking about because of the fact that I present a lot of new analytical
00:54:43 ideas and I try to you know be a guy who also is talking about creators and also is trying to get
00:54:50 people into the media but I'm trying to be like this tour guide like that character you know gets
00:54:56 farther away from the gonzo element where it's like on some level I'm just trying to fucking just
00:55:01 introduce people to new concepts in anime that part of me can be more clean can be more polished
00:55:08 and doesn't have to be so gonzo but I'm not going to abandon the gonzo part and this creates a sort
00:55:15 of conflict of interest and I think this is part of why some of my videos go so misunderstood
00:55:21 because when I make a video like what is the appeal of anime or something like that is meant
00:55:27 to be as broad as possible it's really meant to be something everyone can appreciate and everyone
00:55:32 can learn from um whereas a video like flying witch uh in its fanservice is not broad it's not
00:55:40 for everybody it's not a video that is going to concern everyone it's almost academic it's very
00:55:47 like uh you know it's like a post made for other people who write about anime it's like
00:55:53 criticizing the way that criticism happens so it's a little too meta for for for it to be mainstream
00:56:01 and you know reconciling those two different elements of my work can be difficult and I kind
00:56:08 of wish there was somebody else who wasn't gonzo who was presenting those you know those more
00:56:16 cleaned up versions but then again that person would probably be boring as shit you know because
00:56:21 in my opinion everyone is actually biased and you know are we actually going to care what someone
00:56:28 who's so presentable has to say I don't know I just know that it it's um it's really it's really
00:56:39 weird for me when my lifestyle and moral choices have to come into conflict with my public persona
00:56:49 and the idea of who I am and how certain people perceive me
00:57:02 but it's always gratifying at least to know that there are members of my audience who
00:57:09 absolutely buy into everything I'm doing and saying you know not to say that they like fully
00:57:15 support all of it and they're like oh yeah by all means be a degenerate monster it's just that like
00:57:21 they get it and they see me as a human you know not as a collection of ideals or as like a moral
00:57:30 figurehead or or someone who's trying to present facts and you know in unbiased stances they just
00:57:38 see me as like yeah he's just a he's just an interesting guy you know that's all I want to be
00:57:43 is an interesting guy a guy who you look at and you go man that guy's lifestyle is fascinating
00:57:51 and and and I know that people can do that because there's so many creators who I don't
00:57:56 agree with on so many things but I love them you know film crit hulk one of my favorite
00:58:03 writers of all time you know top five easily top five most influential and favorite people for me
00:58:11 I adore film crit hulk but you know he has a he has a lot of political opinions that I'm just
00:58:18 kind of like come on dude you know he's he he can go like really hard on that like uh like social
00:58:28 justice kind of angle that I don't you know don't resonate with that strongly not to say that I
00:58:33 completely disagree with everything from that camp but sometimes he goes down that road and I
00:58:38 don't feel like I can follow but I don't care because he's a flawed person he's a guy you know I
00:58:45 don't expect him to reflect my ideologies or like my moral stance I just want to read his really
00:58:51 interesting writing you know um and there's so many people I feel that way about uh and it can
00:58:59 there can be breaking points you know there's enough that I don't respect about movie bob that I
00:59:05 can't really watch him anymore without just getting pissed off because it creeps into everything he
00:59:09 does a lot of it being production and presentation that I just have problems with uh but also is
00:59:16 just like fucking shoving his political beliefs down your throat constantly and generally talking
00:59:22 like an asshole I could get into a whole other thing about movie bob I'm sure I've ranted about
00:59:26 him on the pcp a few times but uh but yeah like I just hope that more people can watch me
00:59:36 and think of me as just as just an interesting person who they they like hearing talk and
00:59:44 not trying to uh view me through a moral lens because it's it's unfair in a way that I can't
00:59:54 refute that guy because I don't know him you know that guy who left that comment who is you know
01:00:01 slagging off all these things he knows about me but I don't know about that guy because I'm sure
01:00:06 if I had him describe as much of his life to me as I've described to him I'd find a lot of fucking
01:00:11 shit that I don't agree with that he's done you know but what can you do other than telling
01:00:19 to fuck off and ban him from my subreddit piece of shit I suppose that's about it for this one
01:00:31 I don't really have another thing to decompress about I've had a few ideas of of things to talk
01:00:38 about on this show but um they're kind of more topical and I don't know it's it's weird to just
01:00:45 like jump into some topic that's on my mind on this show uh at least if I haven't fully fleshed it
01:00:51 out and some of those are maybe things for other videos or other places I don't know I'm still
01:00:56 kind of finding what the decompression chamber is exactly so I guess it's probably gonna live for
01:01:02 longer than I previously thought like aside from the fact that it's nice to actually have it when
01:01:07 I do need to decompress I also am not completely sure um what stuff does or doesn't go in this
01:01:16 and that's always an exciting kind of feeling um likewise digi bros might not end as soon as I have
01:01:25 been saying it would just because there has been more interest a little bit and like once I talked
01:01:31 about it you know people spoke up about it and I looked through and realized that the view counts
01:01:35 are not actually any worse than they have typically been and a lot of people pointed out the the rather
01:01:41 obvious reasons that I guess I just kind of forgotten about why the show is not very popular but I'll
01:01:46 get into that um on the next digi bros probably so um so yeah uh that about wraps up this decompression
01:01:58 chamber stick around on my after dark channel for something that's kind of like a decompression
01:02:05 chamber because you know I kind of want to keep this to one a week I don't want to have two come
01:02:08 out um less than a week apart but I do want to do a big end of the year sort of summary of what
01:02:15 things have been like for me kind of video like you know a capping off vlog so expect that to come
01:02:23 and be similar to this but uh yeah that's it uh have a nice day
01:02:38 um
01:03:08 um
01:03:38 um
