00:00:00 We should standardize an intro for this.
00:00:06 That's what all real podcast entertainment shows do.
00:00:10 Yeah, we're a little aligned on branding.
00:00:14 I feel like that would be nice. I feel like if we just set our brand better,
00:00:18 then more people will be able to get into it.
00:00:20 And we want many people to get into it because it's the most insane asinine,
00:00:24 like not a real show show.
00:00:26 And so we need that initial branding marketing to get them into a show
00:00:30 that is not about marketing or having any sort of defined motivation.
00:00:34 I feel like the fact that The Routing Markers' Calculator is this obscure niche of a niche.
00:00:40 It's like the biggest part of the appeal.
00:00:44 I know. Yeah, you're right. But I feel like...
00:00:50 Like no matter what.
00:00:52 That it's totally unbrandable.
00:00:54 Yeah, it's so obscure, but it's also so specific.
00:01:00 I kind of like the idea of making it a show that carries itself.
00:01:04 It's like a big deal in spite of being the least known thing.
00:01:12 I love the fact that the B.C.P. or The Routing Markers' Calculator
00:01:18 is a completely unknown, it should be.
00:01:22 No one watches it.
00:01:24 It has the most dedicated fan base of any B.C.P. show.
00:01:28 And no matter what release or the content of the video,
00:01:33 people will rejoice that there's new R.F.C.P. films.
00:01:35 And then you'll have comments on normal B.C.P. episodes saying
00:01:38 Ben and Munchie just keep doing R.F.C.P. films.
00:01:40 You're better on that. Just keep doing that.
00:01:42 Well, we don't spoil them. We don't spoil them with the RFCK content.
00:01:46 I would like to hear the two things that I want to increase its brand.
00:01:51 And this is the only two.
00:01:53 I want to have a standardized intro that will take
00:01:56 literally less than two seconds.
00:01:58 And I want to release it monthly.
00:02:00 We should definitely release it monthly at the very least.
00:02:03 Are we on right now?
00:02:04 Yes.
00:02:05 Is this going to be on the show?
00:02:06 This discussion?
00:02:07 Let me just make sure.
00:02:09 Yes.
00:02:11 That's fine. I'm just wondering.
00:02:15 Okay, okay. Our intro.
00:02:18 How about...
00:02:20 Okay, this is genius. Check this out, right?
00:02:22 Okay.
00:02:23 It's like we each say one word, but we take turns.
00:02:26 So it's like, rowdy.
00:02:27 Fuckers.
00:02:28 Cop.
00:02:29 Killers.
00:02:30 Fuck.
00:02:31 That's pretty good.
00:02:32 I mean, it's a start.
00:02:34 All right, all right.
00:02:35 So R.F.C.P.ers, cop, killers.
00:02:38 And then we should both at the same time play.
00:02:41 And then whatever.
00:02:43 And the thing about the word play is that it's not a
00:02:48 like a let's play specific thing.
00:02:50 So we can have R.F.C.P.ers play me channel,
00:02:53 or we can have R.F.C.P.ers play being in the park.
00:02:58 Like in real life.
00:02:59 Yeah.
00:03:00 Or maybe it could be something more like do or like...
00:03:05 Do New York.
00:03:06 Or like on.
00:03:08 R.F.C.P.ers on Broadway.
00:03:11 Yeah.
00:03:12 R.F.C.P.ers on musical.
00:03:13 Imagine R.F.C.P.ers cop killers on musical.
00:03:16 R.F.C.P.ers in the Sports Resort.
00:03:19 In, in, we sports, I like that.
00:03:21 I like that.
00:03:22 We're in it.
00:03:23 So R.F.C.P.ers, cop, killers.
00:03:25 Actually, now I'm thinking do you like R.F.C.P.ers, cop, killers,
00:03:28 or do you like R.F.C.P.ers?
00:03:30 Cop, killers.
00:03:32 Oh, okay.
00:03:34 In Canon.
00:03:35 You are the cop killer and I am the R.F.C.P.er.
00:03:38 Okay.
00:03:39 That's, I've always forget.
00:03:41 Yeah, yeah.
00:03:42 You are the, after the rowdy fuckers, cop, killers,
00:03:46 they should be like a sound sting,
00:03:49 like a sound effect of like gunshots, like...
00:03:56 That's pretty good.
00:03:57 That's pretty good.
00:03:58 And I'm like,
00:03:59 fuckers, cop, killers.
00:04:05 Maybe like some police sirens.
00:04:07 Yeah.
00:04:08 And I love, I love those guys.
00:04:10 That we never played particularly violent gangs.
00:04:13 We always played baby shit.
00:04:16 Like we're the toughest, like the toughest fucking gangs.
00:04:20 Like if you just came over to selling drugs
00:04:22 and killing crooked cops.
00:04:24 That's all we have to fucking do.
00:04:26 I love that.
00:04:27 Okay, okay.
00:04:28 So we're gonna go with in.
00:04:29 Okay, I think we do R.F.C.P.ers, cop, killers.
00:04:31 Go back and forth like that.
00:04:32 And then should we do in, and then title?
00:04:35 In, we sports, resort.
00:04:37 Okay, that's good.
00:04:38 I like that.
00:04:39 I like that.
00:04:40 When people hear that intro and get strapped in,
00:04:42 only to find that the podcast is primarily like we sports
00:04:45 and my little pony drop.
00:04:47 Yeah.
00:04:50 It's like long sections of us saying um and then and.
00:04:54 And then also like punctuated by moments of us getting really mad
00:04:58 about how the video game is too hard for us to play.
00:05:02 The we sports episode was particularly like incredible.
00:05:10 You know, there was a competition, but all,
00:05:12 but we were both so geared up and ready to like just like try our
00:05:16 all that none of us talk.
00:05:17 And the only time that we did talk, we were just doing ass
00:05:19 like insults.
00:05:20 God, the most you told us is don't worry.
00:05:23 But you can't do it.
00:05:26 But now we're here.
00:05:27 We have the webcam.
00:05:28 Yeah.
00:05:29 We're ready.
00:05:30 Oh yeah.
00:05:31 This is ready for this cop killers live.
00:05:32 Take two.
00:05:33 Yeah.
00:05:34 Take two.
00:05:35 We're right.
00:05:36 We're fucking wrong.
00:05:37 Um, should we pick it up by the way?
00:05:40 The microphone.
00:05:41 Wait, say something.
00:05:42 Hey, it's me.
00:05:44 Yeah.
00:05:45 Okay.
00:05:46 Yeah.
00:05:47 Yeah.
00:05:48 I'm in this episode too.
00:05:49 Yeah.
00:05:50 Yeah.
00:05:51 In the same room.
00:05:52 You're on the switch one.
00:05:54 Was I?
00:05:55 Yeah.
00:05:56 Cool.
00:05:57 I think you were in the three share or something.
00:05:59 Yeah.
00:06:00 We're doing strategy.
00:06:02 Yeah.
00:06:03 We were coming from the intro here.
00:06:06 You're on.
00:06:07 You're on.
00:06:08 Ready.
00:06:09 Fuckers.
00:06:10 Cop.
00:06:11 Killers.
00:06:12 In.
00:06:13 We.
00:06:14 Sports.
00:06:15 Resort.
00:06:16 Baby.
00:06:17 Fuckers.
00:06:18 Fuck.
00:06:19 Cops.
00:06:20 Yeah.
00:06:21 I'm fucking wrong.
00:06:23 I want Digi to make some sort of rap.
00:06:25 I also want him to be rapping.
00:06:27 I feel like write a rap for us to produce or something.
00:06:31 Yes.
00:06:32 Yes.
00:06:33 It's got to be like the most inner city jungle.
00:06:35 Yeah, I know.
00:06:36 You know, me and my friends in high school actually wrote a rap.
00:06:41 We wrote like a shitty gangster rap.
00:06:44 Let's use that.
00:06:46 I was, my gangster persona was super hard red snapper.
00:06:50 Yeah.
00:06:51 That was my, yeah.
00:06:53 It's bad, but here it is.
00:06:55 Give it up for super hard red snapper.
00:06:58 Get up in his grill and he's going to bust a capo yo ass.
00:07:01 Sprayin' out a buck shot and punchin' and kickin' and keepin' those fat beats red hot.
00:07:05 Like the bitch is my homie slapas guy.
00:07:08 No pants.
00:07:09 Ho slapas got the right stuff.
00:07:11 Always with a bunch of hoes showin' them.
00:07:13 He makes a bunch of hoes and wears one out and finds two more.
00:07:16 See, he pretty fly, but then my man Chewie is one ho stickin' ass kickin' thugger.
00:07:21 And that's why we call him the monkey smuggler.
00:07:23 Cause he go eat shit if he don't like it face.
00:07:26 And piss a whipper chicken ass all over the place.
00:07:28 Yeah, he's a god damn credit to the white race.
00:07:31 Ben, do you understand how the syllables of what you're saying
00:07:36 can easily, perfectly be changed to red for this cop though.
00:07:40 Instead of red hot whippersnapper.
00:07:42 Red hot red snapper.
00:07:44 Super hot red snapper.
00:07:45 And literally Chewy, Munchy.
00:07:48 This is literally the easiest song in the entire world to change.
00:07:52 Should I just cannibalize my old high school bullshit?
00:07:55 Yes, literally.
00:07:56 Yes.
00:07:57 Oh, I used to have a beat.
00:07:58 My friend Ryan wrote a beat for it.
00:07:59 And there was like a chorus.
00:08:00 It was like, suck it out this thugger's way.
00:08:03 You think you got something to say, and I'll break your knees.
00:08:07 It's just another thugger day.
00:08:11 And all the guys say, is just bitch please.
00:08:14 A bitch please.
00:08:16 This is a marketing supernova.
00:08:19 This is the nexus of marketing.
00:08:21 This is the black hole where all brands go to die.
00:08:24 I want the show to be more interesting.
00:08:27 Yeah.
00:08:28 But now, I think you'll get it soon.
00:08:30 This is your mom who gave you credit.
00:08:31 No, no, we have to get to it.
00:08:33 Let's play for me channel.
00:08:35 Let's play for me channel.
00:08:38 I'll be stomping on your chest.
00:08:43 Feels like good.
00:08:44 I'm going to be stomping on the cop cars hood.
00:08:48 Much like how I wear the KKK hood.
00:08:50 And the exact same tone and demeanor.
00:08:53 I was just going through the second verse with the rap.
00:08:56 And I was thinking, oh, this is actually really great.
00:08:58 I actually like this verse better.
00:08:59 But then towards the end, it really dates itself really hard
00:09:02 with references to Osama bin Laden and Anna Nicole Smith.
00:09:05 That is perfect.
00:09:07 It's pretty funny.
00:09:09 All right.
00:09:10 Here's what we should do afterwards.
00:09:11 Or even, you know, fucking on it.
00:09:13 All right.
00:09:14 Let's write this down.
00:09:15 We will never play the game.
00:09:17 We will never start playing.
00:09:19 This is all pre-show since we haven't done our intro yet.
00:09:23 So hold on.
00:09:24 Rowdy Fuckers USA is a mythical metropolis where Osama bin Laden
00:09:29 and Anna Nicole Smith are still on the hook.
00:09:33 Let me show you how to start.
00:09:35 So we should definitely work on this though.
00:09:37 I want you to type out this rap.
00:09:40 You can easily be changed to a rapper exactly a brand.
00:09:44 Easily.
00:09:45 We would need a beat.
00:09:46 Because like it had a beat.
00:09:48 But I don't have the beat anymore.
00:09:50 We can just get someone to produce it.
00:09:53 OK.
00:09:54 We could literally just release the beat.
00:09:56 I totally do not mind candle-lizing.
00:09:58 We literally just released the beat that someone made for Slinger Dead.
00:10:01 The only thing...
00:10:03 Wait.
00:10:04 They're very similar aesthetic shows.
00:10:06 OK.
00:10:07 Yeah, that's fine.
00:10:08 We have my rap and your show's beat.
00:10:11 We can combine them.
00:10:12 Yeah.
00:10:13 Perfect.
00:10:14 That makes sense.
00:10:15 All right.
00:10:16 Perfect.
00:10:17 I'll remember that.
00:10:18 I'll type it out.
00:10:19 Ask me sometime and I'll type it.
00:10:20 It won't take me very long.
00:10:21 OK.
00:10:22 Yeah.
00:10:23 And then we'll type it out.
00:10:24 I'll choose the lyrics to be...
00:10:25 Reversed.
00:10:26 ...a popular theme.
00:10:27 Which I don't think will be hard.
00:10:28 Like just like do the first line again
00:10:30 but replace the name with reverse calculators.
00:10:33 Yeah.
00:10:34 Well.
00:10:35 OK.
00:10:37 Because I wrote one verse.
00:10:39 Well, I wrote one verse.
00:10:41 My friends wrote the other.
00:10:43 I forget which one I wrote.
00:10:44 Whatever.
00:10:45 It doesn't matter.
00:10:46 It's like I'm curious.
00:10:47 Yeah.
00:10:48 Yeah.
00:10:49 It's parody.
00:10:50 OK.
00:10:51 Try to...
00:10:52 Try to...
00:10:53 Reversed.
00:10:54 Reversed.
00:10:55 Being...
00:10:56 Instead of your rap.
00:10:57 What?
00:10:58 What is the first verse of the rap?
00:11:00 I forget how it starts.
00:11:02 It's like...
00:11:05 Shit.
00:11:06 I can't remember how the rap that I just sang started.
00:11:10 Yep.
00:11:11 It's nothing...
00:11:12 This is fucking record because you...
00:11:13 He's literally gone out of your mind
00:11:15 through one mouth to the ether.
00:11:17 Uh...
00:11:19 Sss...
00:11:23 This is the right verse type of rap that you want.
00:11:25 It's Vincent and then looking up in the sky.
00:11:28 Because he does that literally every episode.
00:11:31 Red snapper.
00:11:32 Red snapper.
00:11:33 Here's the intro.
00:11:34 Super hard red snapper.
00:11:39 What the fuck is wrong?
00:11:45 Wait, the super hard red snapper.
00:11:47 Chewie the monkey smuggler.
00:11:49 And the other one.
00:11:51 My friend Dave.
00:11:52 That was less involved.
00:11:56 I don't remember how it fucking started.
00:11:58 That was like a flash in the pan.
00:12:00 It's gone.
00:12:01 We're gonna start our let's play of the Wii channel.
00:12:04 We're not doing Wii Sports Resort?
00:12:05 Well we gotta make some Mii's first.
00:12:07 Okay.
00:12:08 Alright.
00:12:10 Enjoy the intro.
00:12:13 Wait.
00:12:15 Hold on.
00:12:16 It's coming.
00:12:17 Rowdy.
00:12:18 Fuckers.
00:12:19 Cop.
00:12:20 Killers.
00:12:21 In.
00:12:22 Mii Channel!
00:12:31 The video has officially started.
00:12:33 Here we are.
00:12:34 We're ready to do this fucking bullshit.
00:12:36 We are ready to start Clay the Mii Channel as hard as we can.
00:12:39 We're going as hard as a motherfucker.
00:12:41 We're gonna do this to the best of our ability.
00:12:43 That's really what we've got so far.
00:12:45 Hey, is that you?
00:12:46 Yes, me.
00:12:47 Hey, that's me.
00:12:48 We don't actually have to make Mii's because we got them.
00:12:51 Where's my...
00:12:52 Hey, it's Ben's.
00:12:53 Ben's.
00:12:54 It's made by God.
00:12:55 Yeah, you know.
00:12:56 Here, here, here.
00:12:57 I want to update my...
00:12:59 Wait.
00:13:00 I think I have to use yours.
00:13:02 What the fuck?
00:13:03 I know.
00:13:04 This is really fucking with the theme that we just established.
00:13:06 Oh, shit.
00:13:07 Yeah, that I'm Player One.
00:13:08 Yeah.
00:13:09 You come to me, Munchie, you come to me insisting that I be Player One.
00:13:13 How could you ask for shoulder responsibility?
00:13:15 I rash the controller out of your hand and I thrust upon you a new Wiimote.
00:13:21 And I said, my God.
00:13:23 You can tell the Wii was created at a less advanced age,
00:13:26 as there are only two genders to choose from.
00:13:29 Yeah.
00:13:31 Is this Mii?
00:13:32 Is this one?
00:13:33 Oh my God.
00:13:34 Which one's Mii?
00:13:35 He's all jaundiced.
00:13:36 I don't know.
00:13:37 Wait, you're just like me.
00:13:38 You're bottom left.
00:13:43 Yeah.
00:13:45 Okay.
00:13:46 Well, you're somewhere between...
00:13:49 There I go.
00:13:50 You're somewhere between two, three, and four.
00:13:56 You're a monster.
00:13:59 I'm the monster no one deserves, and yet everyone shall obtain.
00:14:03 Oh, look, Mii.
00:14:04 Jumping Jack Jones.
00:14:05 It's the worst guy ever.
00:14:06 Jumping Jack Jones.
00:14:08 Oh, I never told the Wii U Torturer character description.
00:14:14 What is the Wii U Torturer?
00:14:16 The Wii U Torturer is a character that I came up with for a...
00:14:19 Nate, you're looking hairy.
00:14:21 I'm busy.
00:14:22 Okay.
00:14:24 It's a character I came up with for a series of novels that have not started yet
00:14:30 and could probably be called failing and never to exist.
00:14:35 But God damn it, one day they will probably never.
00:14:38 But still, we're working on it.
00:14:40 I mean, I've made a novel idea.
00:14:45 It's quite a novel idea.
00:14:47 Anyway, there's a character called the Wii U Torturer.
00:14:51 His real name is Arthur Wii Allen.
00:14:54 And he...
00:14:55 I forget the entirety of his story, but just first to show that he stomps,
00:14:59 like as hard as he can, Wii U's over and over again.
00:15:02 It is a fetishistic urge that he smashes Wii U gamepads.
00:15:05 Only Wii U's?
00:15:06 Yes, only Wii U's.
00:15:08 Because he wanted to be Sony PlayStation 5 bomb for his first day.
00:15:15 First day?
00:15:16 But his parent, who I believe is the evil CEO of Twitch in the story, Tom Twitch,
00:15:23 got him a Wii U instead, which was about 1,500 generation of video games behind.
00:15:31 Well, God, I mean, I can understand why he's a little fucked up over it.
00:15:37 I know.
00:15:38 And that's why he's dedicated his life to torturing Wii U's.
00:15:40 You need some fan of the Wii U Torturer, even though I already have a design firm,
00:15:43 so you know what you make will be good.
00:15:46 What is my...
00:15:47 What do I...
00:15:48 Is this...
00:15:49 I kind of like that one on the bottom right.
00:15:51 This one?
00:15:52 I mean, it's a little small.
00:15:54 Maybe you could go back one.
00:15:55 Go back one.
00:15:56 This one?
00:15:57 No, no, it's back one page.
00:15:59 I think that the middle one there, bottom middle...
00:16:04 That one's okay.
00:16:07 This is me.
00:16:09 Yeah.
00:16:10 I mean, right?
00:16:11 Yeah, I mean, it's not far off.
00:16:13 Just keep going a little bit.
00:16:14 Maybe it'll be like a slightly, slightly fro-ier one.
00:16:17 Yeah, that's what we need.
00:16:19 There's no Jew fro.
00:16:20 The Wii character creator is so fucking limited.
00:16:23 Even on the Switch, it's so fucking bare-bones and shit.
00:16:29 Yeah.
00:16:30 Well...
00:16:31 Yeah, fuck it.
00:16:32 You win some...
00:16:33 What are my eyebrows?
00:16:35 Well, they're kind of triangular.
00:16:37 Okay.
00:16:38 Go over a page.
00:16:41 Look at me again.
00:16:45 Kind of like knuckle jewelry.
00:16:47 They're kind of like...
00:16:48 They're thickest in the middle.
00:16:50 They kind of get thicker in the middle.
00:16:52 Go back one.
00:16:54 I don't know what I have.
00:16:56 This one?
00:16:58 That one's not bad.
00:16:59 I was looking at that one.
00:17:01 Yeah, yeah.
00:17:02 Oh, what about this?
00:17:03 If I angle this a certain way.
00:17:07 Try that one.
00:17:14 You know, actually, top right.
00:17:18 Yeah, you know what?
00:17:21 Yeah.
00:17:22 Yeah.
00:17:23 Yeah.
00:17:24 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:17:25 Yeah, this is the real shit.
00:17:26 All right.
00:17:27 All right.
00:17:29 When I was a little kid, I used to always, like, without question.
00:17:33 Go for these eyes.
00:17:35 Really?
00:17:36 I mean, they've certainly got their charms.
00:17:40 I have, like, thin eyes, right?
00:17:45 A little bit.
00:17:47 Okay, here, guys.
00:17:48 They're kind of all...
00:17:50 What about these?
00:17:52 I like the one to the right of that.
00:17:54 Yeah.
00:17:56 Yeah, that's better.
00:17:58 Okay.
00:18:00 Whoa.
00:18:01 This is a charm.
00:18:03 God.
00:18:05 I have a big, fat one.
00:18:06 So either this one or this one.
00:18:10 Probably this one.
00:18:11 I think that one.
00:18:12 Yeah.
00:18:13 Shit.
00:18:15 That's good, right?
00:18:16 No, that's not that big.
00:18:18 Okay.
00:18:19 Yeah, I like that.
00:18:20 I like that.
00:18:21 Okay.
00:18:22 Yeah, okay.
00:18:25 You have a small mouth.
00:18:27 That's small.
00:18:28 Do I have a noticeable lips?
00:18:30 Yeah, yeah, they're noticeable, but they're not huge.
00:18:35 Oh, no.
00:18:37 You have a...
00:18:39 You have, like, a pretty pronounced, like, curve, you know?
00:18:43 Okay, like this.
00:18:45 No.
00:18:47 It's like that.
00:18:50 Wait, to the right, to the right, on the bottom.
00:18:55 Make it small.
00:18:57 I'm pretty close.
00:18:59 One more down.
00:19:01 There.
00:19:02 Yeah?
00:19:03 Maybe move it down a little.
00:19:04 Well, actually, no.
00:19:05 No, it's good there.
00:19:06 Okay.
00:19:07 I think we're...
00:19:08 Actually, you know what?
00:19:09 Make your eyes a little smaller.
00:19:10 Okay.
00:19:11 Actually, there might be...
00:19:13 Yes.
00:19:14 Okay, we're getting somewhere.
00:19:15 Okay.
00:19:16 Go try the next page.
00:19:18 All right.
00:19:19 I fucking love making knees, by the way.
00:19:21 I know, this is great.
00:19:22 I used to do this.
00:19:23 Literally, what I would do every sleepover was we would want to play Super Smash,
00:19:26 which was probably me and my offline friends,
00:19:28 but we'd just get so caught up in making knees
00:19:30 and we'd just spend the entire night making knees
00:19:32 and just telling stories about what we'd done
00:19:34 during the most absolutely incredible...
00:19:36 Going over it?
00:19:41 I mean...
00:19:43 I think these ones are pretty good.
00:19:46 I like...
00:19:48 Okay.
00:19:49 I don't think there...
00:19:51 There's none that I think is an obviously better fit,
00:19:54 but I think that there are other ones that could work.
00:19:56 I feel like this mouth does not fit me simply
00:19:58 because it does not communicate that I'm a little shit.
00:20:02 I mean, I think it looks pretty...
00:20:05 I think this one actually...
00:20:07 Actually, that one's pretty good, too.
00:20:09 That I'm a little shit.
00:20:11 I think it's a little less...
00:20:13 ...photo.
00:20:14 It's a little less anatomically accurate,
00:20:16 but it's more like...
00:20:17 ...totally accurate.
00:20:18 Spiritually, right?
00:20:19 Yeah.
00:20:20 Yeah, okay.
00:20:21 That's pretty good.
00:20:22 All right.
00:20:23 I like fitly kind of glasses, right?
00:20:25 Yeah.
00:20:28 I wish I could...
00:20:30 I mean, I guess...
00:20:31 I wish they had half-brands.
00:20:33 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:20:34 Actually, wait, can...
00:20:35 No.
00:20:40 Maybe use the bigger, the wider ones.
00:20:44 I think that looks a little closer
00:20:46 to the reality of the situation.
00:20:48 This guy looks nice.
00:20:49 This guy actually looks like me.
00:20:51 I look like me.
00:20:52 I make like, based off the way I draw myself.
00:20:54 Yeah.
00:20:55 Which, oh god, you know what I do that I fucking hate?
00:20:57 Or is that I always...
00:20:59 I do the webcomic artist curse
00:21:02 of making myself look better than I do in real life.
00:21:04 Yeah.
00:21:05 I kind of do...
00:21:07 I just made my guy look as generic as possible.
00:21:10 So, I don't know.
00:21:12 I mean, everyone does it.
00:21:14 I know.
00:21:15 It's...
00:21:16 I don't blame it.
00:21:17 Like, it annoys me when I see other people do it,
00:21:19 but not too much,
00:21:20 because I totally understand why the compulsion is there.
00:21:23 Yeah.
00:21:24 Because you don't want to like...
00:21:26 Just like, like, no...
00:21:28 And like, constantly portray yourself as being...
00:21:31 Yeah.
00:21:32 You guys have a poop.
00:21:33 Yeah.
00:21:34 Like, the last part of a poop doesn't want to come out.
00:21:37 Oh my god.
00:21:38 You feel it, like, inside your butt all day.
00:21:40 That's what the, like, shit stool is for.
00:21:43 Like, the thing that you put your feet up on?
00:21:45 Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
00:21:46 Dude, I have never used it.
00:21:47 But I have heard.
00:21:48 Oh, okay, okay.
00:21:49 It helps with that.
00:21:50 There are so many points I want to make here.
00:21:52 Like, if an entire podcast
00:21:53 is based off of this short exchange right here.
00:21:55 By the way, we are literally the green triangle
00:21:57 of intellect right now.
00:21:59 What does that mean?
00:22:01 We're a range of...
00:22:02 I don't know, but I agree and support it.
00:22:04 Okay.
00:22:05 First of all, I have heard the shit stool.
00:22:08 Does that mean that all intellect dies?
00:22:10 Yeah.
00:22:11 It goes and never comes back.
00:22:14 I've never tried the shit stool,
00:22:16 but I've heard of it,
00:22:17 and so now whenever I take a shit stool,
00:22:19 I go like this,
00:22:20 as big as I can.
00:22:21 I still have never tried the technique.
00:22:25 There was a chair in my bathroom,
00:22:28 like next to my toilet.
00:22:29 Yeah, he did!
00:22:31 I used it as the shit stool.
00:22:33 Oh, my God.
00:22:34 We are on the same wavelength.
00:22:35 I haven't had to,
00:22:36 but maybe I should.
00:22:37 Maybe I should just fight that bullet.
00:22:38 Do it.
00:22:39 We all got to make it up.
00:22:41 And Roddy fuckers,
00:22:42 fuckers, fuckers!
00:22:43 It is!
00:22:44 It's a shit stool.
00:22:45 Sponsored by the shit stool.
00:22:47 I had an irritable bowel syndrome.
00:22:50 They had to stick someone's hand up my ass.
00:22:52 Really?
00:22:53 Yeah.
00:22:54 Yeah, I know.
00:22:55 Wait, did it go away?
00:22:56 Yes.
00:22:57 I didn't know it could go away.
00:22:59 I think I had some sort of weird option of it,
00:23:02 where it was like I had the symptoms of it,
00:23:05 but I didn't actually have it.
00:23:07 Oh, God.
00:23:08 Very sick.
00:23:09 So the last shit,
00:23:11 the experience I have of trying to get the shit out,
00:23:15 like the last one that you've just tried,
00:23:17 was every part of the shit forever.
00:23:19 Oh, my God.
00:23:20 So I spent...
00:23:21 Oh, my God.
00:23:22 Jesus, bro.
00:23:23 All right.
00:23:24 The real triangle of intellect, ladies and gentlemen.
00:23:27 Hashtag that shit.
00:23:28 Do you want to...
00:23:29 Is it here?
00:23:30 How do we...
00:23:31 Yeah, this is kind of weird, but I'm into it.
00:23:32 Okay.
00:23:33 Yeah, looks good.
00:23:34 And so I would be in the toilet for like two hours.
00:23:37 Oh, two hours.
00:23:38 Camera, too.
00:23:39 I didn't even notice that one.
00:23:40 Yeah, dude.
00:23:41 Uh, fuck you.
00:23:42 It's static.
00:23:43 Mangle.
00:23:44 Wait, yeah, okay.
00:23:46 Let's turn the mic.
00:23:48 So it goes this...
00:23:50 Then again.
00:23:52 Well, who cares?
00:23:54 We can breathe down.
00:23:56 So, there you go.
00:23:58 Yeah.
00:23:59 Once you hear a little louder, dude.
00:24:02 Jess, like you have short hair.
00:24:04 Like, I would describe it as like some sort of friendly,
00:24:08 a hitchhiker that is too friendly.
00:24:11 And so you don't trust them and you drive past them.
00:24:14 Good.
00:24:17 You look like...
00:24:21 Like you work in a library.
00:24:24 I like that.
00:24:27 I love...
00:24:28 Libraries are like the only...
00:24:29 I love the fact that they're still a place where people are not allowed to make noise.
00:24:33 Or like a newsroom.
00:24:35 Or like a printing room.
00:24:37 Yeah, you want to make me?
00:24:38 Oh, hell yeah.
00:24:40 Do you have any experience in making a book?
00:24:42 You can make yourself a beard.
00:24:44 Let's see here.
00:24:45 I guess the beard obviously sucks.
00:24:47 Should I make it me that looks like me?
00:24:48 Or should I make a fucking freak of hell?
00:24:50 Make one that looks like you and then we can do one.
00:24:55 Hey, what's up with the...
00:24:58 The OBS is not showing the entire thing.
00:25:01 What do you mean?
00:25:02 Well, like, look how little of the video it's capturing.
00:25:05 Um...
00:25:07 Yeah, sure.
00:25:09 Has it been doing it this whole time?
00:25:11 Yeah, but I don't really care.
00:25:13 It sucks.
00:25:14 Man, it's fine.
00:25:15 No, get the whole thing in there, man.
00:25:17 I am. I'm doing that right now.
00:25:18 Hey.
00:25:19 Yeah?
00:25:20 I'll beat you up.
00:25:21 Listen, man, that would be funny if it weren't physically impossible.
00:25:26 Yeah.
00:25:27 Come back with some real-ass coming next time, kid.
00:25:29 Well...
00:25:30 Listen, I bet you didn't even go to Los Angeles.
00:25:32 I mean...
00:25:33 God, I don't want to dox my birthday.
00:25:35 Uh...
00:25:36 Wait, I can put a question mark.
00:25:39 That's not fucking paranoid I've become.
00:25:41 I don't want to dox my birthday.
00:25:43 Yeah, they can find me.
00:25:44 Someone might give me a fucking present.
00:25:46 I don't want that shit.
00:25:47 Jesus.
00:25:48 Someone might be nice.
00:25:49 All right.
00:25:50 All right.
00:25:51 All right.
00:25:52 This is the real shit, right?
00:25:53 That's not cool.
00:25:54 It's professional.
00:25:57 Dude, do you want to get underneath the mic?
00:26:01 Oh, yeah.
00:26:02 What should I do to get out from underneath the mic?
00:26:04 Uh, we...
00:26:05 Since we're doing...
00:26:06 Wait.
00:26:07 I need it to get out from under the...
00:26:09 Under its thumb.
00:26:11 Hold on.
00:26:12 You can put it backwards.
00:26:15 How is this...
00:26:16 Okay, wait.
00:26:17 How is this any better?
00:26:18 Move that around much here.
00:26:19 And then move the thing around to its axis.
00:26:23 This is some fucking...
00:26:26 Bermuda's Triangle of Intellect Geometry.
00:26:28 Arrange the...
00:26:29 You know, point the mic towards the center of the galaxy.
00:26:34 Let it...
00:26:35 Then Rhymoscopilus will become 10 times faster.
00:26:39 I made me a favorite to help this other guy.
00:26:42 Well, play your cards right.
00:26:44 Maybe one day you'll earn that title.
00:26:47 Well, it's not any better because it's still right in front of you.
00:26:50 Yeah.
00:26:51 I think it's true.
00:26:52 Favorite color.
00:26:53 It used to be yellow.
00:26:54 Don't dox favorite color, Cassie.
00:26:56 I'm taking it back.
00:26:57 I don't give a fuck.
00:26:58 That actually looks quite bad.
00:27:00 Yeah.
00:27:01 Unfortunate.
00:27:02 I'll do purple.
00:27:03 Here we go.
00:27:04 I'm always black.
00:27:09 Well, make sure the audience are right.
00:27:12 How will you know?
00:27:14 Say something.
00:27:15 No.
00:27:16 Yeah, you say something.
00:27:17 Hey, there.
00:27:19 I think I just have a powerful diaphragm.
00:27:22 I just have some sort of...
00:27:24 Whoa.
00:27:25 It's working.
00:27:26 Are you? Because I'm not seeing anything.
00:27:29 Hello.
00:27:31 Ooh.
00:27:34 Hi, it's me, Munchie.
00:27:35 It's working like...
00:27:37 I don't think it's getting in here.
00:27:42 I mean, I'm sorry, audience, that I'm like...
00:27:44 Hello.
00:27:45 No, no, no.
00:27:46 Hello.
00:27:47 Hello.
00:27:48 No, no, no, no, it's...
00:27:51 I think it's just the backside of the mic.
00:27:56 Wait, this is the back of the mic?
00:27:58 No, I just rotated it, I think.
00:28:02 And so I think...
00:28:04 I have no fucking clue.
00:28:05 I have no fucking...
00:28:07 Hey, hey, hey.
00:28:08 It's me saying words.
00:28:10 Hold on.
00:28:19 I'm sure this sounds really good for them.
00:28:23 It's fine.
00:28:24 It's getting in our voice.
00:28:27 It's getting in our voice.
00:28:29 Yeah, it's fine.
00:28:30 What else could we be recording from?
00:28:32 I don't know.
00:28:44 It thinks I'm louder when I'm over here.
00:28:47 You know what it probably is doing.
00:28:50 That was perfect.
00:28:54 Yeah, it says so.
00:28:56 That's Jesse for you.
00:28:59 Yep.
00:29:01 Got it.
00:29:06 Hello.
00:29:07 Yes, I forgot.
00:29:08 I forgot how much I love making beats.
00:29:10 Oh, you know what it's doing?
00:29:11 What?
00:29:12 Which is fine.
00:29:13 Is it recording through the laptop speakers?
00:29:14 Yes.
00:29:15 I know it.
00:29:16 That's fine.
00:29:17 No, it sucks to ask.
00:29:18 So can we just get this fucking microphone out of here?
00:29:22 Yes.
00:29:23 The microphone is not recording?
00:29:25 No.
00:29:26 What the fuck?
00:29:27 Complete waste.
00:29:30 This could have sounded really bad then.
00:29:33 I love that concern effect.
00:29:35 I don't really mind that.
00:29:37 Yeah, okay.
00:29:39 That's a bummer.
00:29:40 I feel like we're in a right focus like this.
00:29:42 You don't care about stuff like audio quality.
00:29:44 Yeah.
00:29:45 Yeah.
00:29:46 Yeah, the problem is that this is not plugged in is the problem.
00:29:51 Let's just plug this in and see what happens.
00:29:54 You know, I read somewhere like I'm like cracked.
00:29:57 That like parting your hair to the right looks more masculine to the left.
00:30:02 Like with the part on the right?
00:30:04 That's what was my question because like I was reading the article and I'm like, wait,
00:30:08 what do you mean by parted on the right?
00:30:10 Like going right or from the right?
00:30:13 Well, part on the right, which I do not do.
00:30:16 I part my hair on the left.
00:30:18 So the hair goes from the left to the right.
00:30:20 Like my hair naturally does it like this and sometimes I do it.
00:30:24 I don't know.
00:30:25 Hold on, wait.
00:30:34 But like I had a bunch of examples from like pop culture.
00:30:37 How like Captain Kirk's hair is always like this.
00:30:41 Superman's hair is like this.
00:30:42 But Clark Kent's hair is like this because he's a weakling.
00:30:49 Like you think that you think that the creators of Superman would have had to
00:30:53 have read that crack article to make that creative decision.
00:30:57 They sent one cracked article back to 1978.
00:31:01 So that they could get Superman's hair right.
00:31:06 That's the only thing that was ever done with time travel.
00:31:09 After that we threw the technology away.
00:31:11 We were like, okay, we've got to steal this away.
00:31:13 But first we can make one change.
00:31:17 We have to choose carefully.
00:31:20 Oh, wait.
00:31:26 It is.
00:31:37 I think it's just going to record through this until we restart it,
00:31:40 I don't really care about doing and I don't, am I?
00:31:42 You want me to just let it go?
00:31:43 Yeah, just let it go.
00:31:44 So if we get rid of this thing?
00:31:45 Yeah, it cares.
00:31:46 Okay.
00:31:48 I mean, the people, oh my God, Jesse.
00:31:51 Oh, there it is.
00:31:52 This is the most fucking N with G God.
00:31:55 Oh, shit.
00:31:59 I look at this guy's eyes and like like literally like time has stopped.
00:32:04 My life has paused.
00:32:05 And I have just watched for version finale five times in reverse.
00:32:10 He's so cool.
00:32:13 But is that what you have?
00:32:14 Yeah, you're green eyes.
00:32:16 Yeah.
00:32:17 That's fucking like, that's character style.
00:32:18 That's like clear as that.
00:32:21 Yeah, yeah, I have green eyes like F and Jack.
00:32:23 Oh, fuck!
00:32:25 Oh, you think that's where they got it from?
00:32:28 Do you think that's where they got my eye filler from?
00:32:30 Yeah, yeah.
00:32:36 I mean, I had to come from someone.
00:32:38 Where else?
00:32:39 Yeah.
00:32:40 I had to come from someone.
00:32:41 It's always done somewhere.
00:32:42 All of these buses are mods.
00:32:44 Oh, yeah, yeah, Skull.
00:32:45 Yeah.
00:32:46 Skull.
00:32:47 Skull.
00:32:48 Skull.
00:32:49 Hey, should we move like laptop?
00:32:51 Nah, fuck it.
00:32:52 Oh my God, I love that.
00:32:55 That guy knows what's up.
00:32:57 It's the PCP guy mouth.
00:32:59 He is, he totally is.
00:33:05 Here, guys, do you want to pause for one second
00:33:07 and then just check and make sure the audio is here
00:33:09 quite listenable?
00:33:10 Okay, sure.
00:33:11 Yeah, okay.
00:33:14 Hey, Jesse, screamer will be funny between cuts.
00:33:16 Wait, what?
00:33:17 Screamer, quick.
00:33:24 We're back now, we're back.
00:33:26 Does the laptop not have speakers?
00:33:28 No, it's connected to like two of the Elgato's
00:33:30 so I can't really tell what it's saying,
00:33:32 like I can't believe the headphones in.
00:33:33 Hey, I'm going to show you, here comes back
00:33:35 when you're still on the bus.
00:33:36 Sorry, recording again?
00:33:37 Yeah.
00:33:38 Okay, a second.
00:33:39 Where do they miss?
00:33:41 I don't know.
00:33:42 Jesse finished as me.
00:33:43 I want to do like that.
00:33:44 That's pretty much it.
00:33:45 Yeah.
00:33:46 Here, hold on.
00:33:47 Check out this.
00:33:50 Oh, shit.
00:33:52 Oh, shit.
00:33:53 Here comes Backman.
00:33:55 Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
00:33:57 What's up?
00:33:58 Hey, Backman.
00:34:00 What's up?
00:34:01 Hey, this is a high-end product.
00:34:04 What, a free base?
00:34:06 No, Backman, drugs are bad.
00:34:08 Yeah, can't help it.
00:34:10 Okay, I've heard this.
00:34:11 I have not seen this animation.
00:34:14 Whoa!
00:34:15 Oh, shit.
00:34:20 Okay.
00:34:22 Yeah, yeah.
00:34:28 I feel like Backman is me.
00:34:30 Every single day.
00:34:31 Every day when I wake up, this isn't required anywhere,
00:34:34 but whenever I wake up, I come down and say,
00:34:36 hey, motherfuckers, who wants a freebie?
00:34:39 I'm high, I'm crack.
00:34:41 And I say that every time I come down to this.
00:34:43 Can you say in the video that's just like six minutes
00:34:46 of Hagrid and Harry Potter, of him like,
00:34:49 I'm Harry, just Harry.
00:34:52 He's like, no.
00:34:54 Who is your dad, right?
00:34:56 Like back, like, do you guys know what I'm talking about?
00:34:58 No.
00:34:59 Good, look it up.
00:35:05 Uh, fuck.
00:35:06 I'm not sure what to type,
00:35:07 but type like you're a wizard, Harry.
00:35:09 Or something like that.
00:35:11 Make some fucked up shit.
00:35:13 Make some fucked up shit.
00:35:14 Coming right up.
00:35:16 I want to do like a skit of like,
00:35:18 if people treat it like how they want to look in real life,
00:35:22 like how they want to look in games.
00:35:24 Like a guy goes to a plastic surgeon,
00:35:26 and like, he's like, look,
00:35:28 I want purple skin.
00:35:30 I want eyes like Brock from Pokemon.
00:35:33 I want to be fat as fucking shit.
00:35:39 Hop to it, you fuck.
00:35:42 I want to be a monster.
00:35:45 Not this.
00:35:47 It's like a, it's like a, like an animation.
00:35:51 This is the top right there.
00:35:56 Is that heck?
00:35:58 Let's see.
00:36:03 This is different than what it's just been.
00:36:15 They're just Harry.
00:36:17 I suppose the lines are just lines.
00:36:20 And gods are just gods.
00:36:27 You know, you know what this has the same tone of?
00:36:33 It's Goat and Seller.
00:36:35 Yeah, exactly.
00:36:37 It's that kind of like bullshit.
00:36:39 Bullshit.
00:36:42 Alright, I want this nigger.
00:36:45 I want, okay, first of all, nigger.
00:36:47 First of all, nigger.
00:36:49 I want this nigger to be like cut,
00:36:51 the kind of cut where you can still beat him up.
00:36:53 Another one.
00:36:55 Yeah, like model cut.
00:36:57 Yeah, like model cut.
00:36:59 Yeah, like tiny weights.
00:37:01 Or just company has aids.
00:37:03 So a strong breeze will push him over.
00:37:06 I think you want that one.
00:37:08 I think you want that sunken cheeks.
00:37:10 What if, what if you're an anorexic girl
00:37:13 and you wanted to kill yourself because you were anorexic.
00:37:15 But because you were anorexic, you were wobbly.
00:37:18 So you got up on like a lead and you're like,
00:37:20 you know what, I don't actually want to kill myself,
00:37:22 but a breeze pushed you over because you were anorexic.
00:37:24 I feel, well, I imagine
00:37:27 he wouldn't be too,
00:37:29 this guy looks awful.
00:37:31 Yeah.
00:37:34 He's, he looks impossible.
00:37:39 That's like the AIDS hat.
00:37:41 Yeah, yeah.
00:37:43 What's it, what's it with me hats being like the most
00:37:47 the me hats are like the most iconically awful video game
00:37:52 mechanism or any sort of thing from a video game.
00:37:57 Most iconically terrible thing.
00:37:59 Yeah.
00:38:00 Like it's like they knew that they would never approach
00:38:02 like the breadth of what a hat could be.
00:38:04 So they didn't even try it.
00:38:05 I mean, just pick one and did it.
00:38:07 All right.
00:38:08 I guess that'll do.
00:38:10 Would you make one that like looks like your avatar
00:38:12 because they have to be.
00:38:13 Yeah, I've, I've done it.
00:38:15 It's great.
00:38:16 Actually, I'll do that next.
00:38:18 Okay.
00:38:19 Let me flex my mean hats.
00:38:22 On my way.
00:38:23 I think you want real thin.
00:38:25 My, my, my, my stoner fringe.
00:38:28 He's always come over to my house.
00:38:30 He would just make me literally all night.
00:38:33 And he would just explain to me what kind of stoner parties
00:38:36 he's gone to.
00:38:37 And so he comes up with stuff like Ferdinand,
00:38:41 zzzzzzz music.
00:38:42 Sign.
00:38:48 Seed and a lot of.
00:39:02 Who.
00:39:03 Yeah.
00:39:04 I feel like that's our dynamic.
00:39:06 In your.
00:39:07 Yes.
00:39:08 Dude, we should put that at like the beginning of every episode.
00:39:11 You know what's fucked up?
00:39:12 We should make them our mascots.
00:39:13 You know what's fucked up too is that the Applejack's background is literally the same
00:39:17 color as like the background of Roger Scott's podcast.
00:39:20 Oh, the green.
00:39:21 Yeah.
00:39:22 Yes.
00:39:23 Shut your face, dad.
00:39:26 I'm totally me.
00:39:27 Me.
00:39:28 Eating Applejack's from A to B.
00:39:29 That's just the first thing that comes to your head no matter what.
00:39:34 No matter what.
00:39:35 I'm not a fan of the Dramium.
00:39:38 Bye.
00:39:39 We the hell no dogs.
00:39:43 Yo, I'm high on crack.
00:39:47 Wanna free me?
00:39:50 No, I'm straight laced.
00:39:54 I only smoke the natural ganja as God demands.
00:40:00 Yes, she was this Rupert not God to you.
00:40:04 It's free.
00:40:09 This guy looks nice.
00:40:12 I want him to teach me to ride a bicycle.
00:40:15 He kind of looks like my dead grandpa.
00:40:18 Really?
00:40:19 Yeah.
00:40:20 Nice.
00:40:21 I know.
00:40:22 It doesn't look anything like my dead grandpa.
00:40:27 This is like the happiest nigger I've seen in a while.
00:40:30 I'm really uncomfortable with the use of the hard R on an actual person of color.
00:40:36 What a hot take.
00:40:38 Yeah.
00:40:39 He's not a person yet.
00:40:42 He will soon.
00:40:43 That's true.
00:40:44 He doesn't have rights yet.
00:40:45 Yeah.
00:40:46 Those are his eyebrows.
00:40:47 We haven't cut the umbilical cord.
00:40:54 Yes.
00:40:55 What a piece of shit.
00:40:59 This guy looks like Gendo Ikari.
00:41:09 Can you imagine how much better it would be?
00:41:19 He's right here among us.
00:41:24 What?
00:41:25 Gendo Ikari.
00:41:26 So much better.
00:41:27 He didn't get the part.
00:41:31 He was a method actor.
00:41:33 I just love the idea of Gendo so much that he just became Gendo for the rest of his life.
00:41:39 He's got no body.
00:41:42 Just like Gendo in real life.
00:41:46 Gendo has navy blue and red, right?
00:41:50 Yeah.
00:41:51 I like how on the capture, our picture-in-a-picture camera is just tying up so that you can't
00:42:04 see the body.
00:42:05 I forgot.
00:42:06 Hold on.
00:42:07 I have to do something important.
00:42:08 What?
00:42:09 Is it suicide?
00:42:11 Order transform.
00:42:12 Order.
00:42:13 Order.
00:42:14 Not order.
00:42:16 Order.
00:42:17 Order.
00:42:21 I'll do it.
00:42:22 It doesn't make any sense.
00:42:25 It sounds scary.
00:42:27 Alright, let's see.
00:42:29 Man fuck.
00:42:31 Okay, I said I was going to make me, but I don't want some anymore.
00:42:41 I'm going to have something cooked up.
00:42:44 One little change is all it takes to go from a human being to a fat shit.
00:42:57 Do you think we can afford to get some BBW whenever there's got to be some time?
00:43:07 Can we afford it?
00:43:09 I don't know.
00:43:10 Can we afford not to is the question.
00:43:14 No.
00:43:15 Well, I don't know.
00:43:16 What happened?
00:43:17 What?
00:43:18 You lost the signal.
00:43:21 Wait, wait.
00:43:22 Oh, it's back.
00:43:23 Okay.
00:43:24 False alarm.
00:43:25 All right.
00:43:29 Here we go.
00:43:30 Actually, yeah.
00:43:31 There we go.
00:43:32 There we go.
00:43:33 There we go.
00:43:34 Okay.
00:43:35 I have centered the webcam within the screen.
00:43:38 So now you can literally not avoid it no matter what you do.
00:43:42 Literally in the center of the screen.
00:43:44 That's awful.
00:43:45 That's the worst.
00:43:47 No, that's good.
00:43:49 Oh, okay.
00:43:50 Yeah.
00:43:51 I mean, I guess it's in the spirit.
00:43:53 Yeah.
00:43:54 But it's pretty fucking big.
00:43:58 Oh, you know what we should do?
00:43:59 We should make a rather as popular as the Valentine's Day special.
00:44:03 Did you say Valentine's Day?
00:44:05 Yeah.
00:44:06 Okay.
00:44:07 Good.
00:44:08 I don't know what it would be about.
00:44:09 Valentine's Day special.
00:44:12 Well, it would probably be about how much we love killing cops.
00:44:16 What do we love?
00:44:18 We love killing cops.
00:44:21 We love breaking mops.
00:44:24 We love.
00:44:26 We love practicing.
00:44:27 We love killing cops and breaking mops.
00:44:29 Off in our assholes.
00:44:31 The end.
00:44:33 How long do you think you can take before something like a dick of your ass would hurt?
00:44:37 Like how many inches do you need to take?
00:44:40 I mean, I think it would hurt right away.
00:44:43 Yeah.
00:44:44 Yeah, I don't think there's...
00:44:46 Unless we got like thicker at the bottom.
00:44:49 Yeah.
00:44:50 It's like a needle.
00:44:52 Dude.
00:44:53 Oh my God.
00:44:54 What if you had like a, like, not like a needle pin, but like a small pin.
00:44:57 Like you could poke and stab with it.
00:45:00 I feel like that would be ideal if you're sucking out the juice of the clit.
00:45:04 For pop and that's hard to pop.
00:45:06 You're sucking out the juice of the clit.
00:45:10 Wait, wait, wait.
00:45:11 Oh, you're dead.
00:45:13 Oh my God.
00:45:17 Oh, no.
00:45:21 Dude, is that shinging?
00:45:23 Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
00:45:28 Yes.
00:45:33 Here we go.
00:45:35 Now we're talking.
00:45:38 Now we're cooking.
00:45:42 Oh my God.
00:45:46 Holy shit.
00:45:47 Pretty cool, right?
00:45:49 Is that a triforce?
00:45:50 It will be.
00:45:52 Hold on.
00:45:53 Eyebrows, these can go a little...
00:45:57 Oh, they all could push together.
00:45:59 Oh, what?
00:46:01 Mouth.
00:46:06 Yeah, it's a little better.
00:46:08 Okay, yes.
00:46:10 What are you trying to do here?
00:46:12 I'm just trying to make something great.
00:46:14 They'll stay on the test of time.
00:46:16 And something to be remembered for.
00:46:18 That's a humble goal.
00:46:24 What do you think it's like after you die?
00:46:28 It's probably a lot like this.
00:46:30 Yeah.
00:46:31 Dude, what?
00:46:32 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:46:34 I feel like it was just the meat channel on week.
00:46:37 That's a black mirror episode.
00:46:40 I could deal.
00:46:42 I could deal.
00:46:44 I could probably deal with anything.
00:46:47 I'd take anything and I'd be happy for it.
00:46:58 I know.
00:47:01 I know.
00:47:05 I know.
00:47:09 I want no hair.
00:47:11 Here we go.
00:47:13 Oh my...
00:47:15 I think this is it.
00:47:16 I think I've done it.
00:47:23 Well...
00:47:24 Day is...
00:47:26 Day is...
00:47:28 Wait, hold on.
00:47:30 Yeah.
00:47:32 That'll be his mouth.
00:47:34 Yeah.
00:47:37 No, yeah, just be really close like that.
00:47:40 Yeah!
00:47:42 Wait, is it better if it's up here?
00:47:44 I feel like below is better.
00:47:45 Yeah, I agree.
00:47:49 It kind of looks like a butt.
00:47:51 No.
00:47:53 Yeah.
00:47:56 No.
00:47:58 No.
00:48:00 That's awful, yeah.
00:48:02 Yeah, just give him some cool shade.
00:48:04 Give him a little beard.
00:48:06 You don't have to be an asshole for beard.
00:48:08 That's actually not too bad.
00:48:10 I almost like it.
00:48:12 But it's a little too human.
00:48:13 It kind of looks like fucking...
00:48:15 Dude, is that Gendo card?
00:48:17 No.
00:48:19 I was going to say ndeki.
00:48:21 Oh yeah.
00:48:23 He looks like...
00:48:24 He looks a bit like an egg.
00:48:27 I don't want this.
00:48:32 Handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar.
00:48:42 I'm not even like getting gun sex artifacts.
00:48:44 Like you were in stream, you know, just be that.
00:48:46 Yeah.
00:48:48 My baby!
00:48:50 They shot my baby!
00:48:52 The Gendo Capitalist Revolution is here!
00:48:58 Nah, I don't like this.
00:48:59 Handlebar.
00:49:01 He's getting too many gimmicks, he's getting overcomplicated.
00:49:03 Yeah!
00:49:05 Yeah!
00:49:09 My god, he's like a bum now!
00:49:11 Oh my god, he's a praying mantis!
00:49:16 How did I...
00:49:17 Did I fucking do it or what?
00:49:19 You did it.
00:49:20 Did I fucking nail it or what?
00:49:22 Did I knock it out of the park?
00:49:24 I didn't.
00:49:26 You know what, actually, hold on, let me experiment with drugs and lesbianism.
00:49:32 I think this guy was the original bug that started the bug war.
00:49:36 I think this is the genesis of all bug war activities.
00:49:39 Yeah, this is Joey Bug War.
00:49:41 Joey Bug War.
00:49:43 No, just Joey Bug.
00:49:45 Joey Bug.
00:49:47 Uh, I think...
00:49:50 It was named after him, you know, Bug War.
00:49:55 Joey Bug.
00:49:57 I think the color you originally had was the best.
00:49:59 Yeah.
00:50:00 You think so?
00:50:01 Yeah.
00:50:02 We can't have everyone be black.
00:50:05 That's true.
00:50:06 That would be it.
00:50:07 In the words of God, we can't have everyone be black.
00:50:13 Oh my god!
00:50:14 I'm gonna make some white people now.
00:50:16 That can't possibly go wrong.
00:50:18 Yeah.
00:50:19 Fucking...
00:50:20 Okay, God creating humans fake.
00:50:22 Like, humans evolving fake.
00:50:24 The real shape is higher conscious beings are just plain, like, me-maker,
00:50:30 and whatever me's they make aren't a lower level of conscious, like a lower dimension.
00:50:35 It's just me-makers all the way down is what you're saying?
00:50:37 Yeah, exactly.
00:50:38 So, like, the 11th and 12th dimensions are making, like, human-like me's,
00:50:42 and human-like me's are making weird, fucked up monster ghosts,
00:50:45 and those are what probably are the lower dimensions.
00:50:47 Uh, what do you think?
00:50:48 Like this?
00:50:49 Or like this?
00:50:50 I think the one you were just on.
00:50:52 This one?
00:50:53 Yeah, I think that one's the best.
00:50:54 Okay.
00:50:56 Uh...
00:50:58 Oh!
00:50:59 Make them really thin and really, like, small.
00:51:03 What a creepy creature.
00:51:05 Oh!
00:51:06 No, not fat.
00:51:07 Yeah, yeah.
00:51:08 Yeah, like that.
00:51:09 Small.
00:51:10 Yeah.
00:51:11 He's a bug.
00:51:12 He's Joey Bug.
00:51:13 It's not small.
00:51:14 It's pretty small.
00:51:15 Okay, should I quit?
00:51:16 Go to his name.
00:51:18 Joey Bug.
00:51:20 Um...
00:51:23 I'm...

00:52:30 Not Mario.
00:52:31 You want Balor Revolution?
00:52:32 I love that game.
00:52:34 You've never heard of it.
00:52:35 You've never even heard of it.
00:52:37 Wait, what's Balor Revolution?
00:52:38 Balor Revolution was like the other state.
00:52:42 Like stadium for weed.
00:52:48 Um...
00:52:49 Fake.
00:52:51 You made that up.
00:52:54 This TV...
00:52:55 The colors are so fucking blown out.
00:52:58 You're asking me blown out.
00:53:00 Fucking smoke a pile.
00:53:01 They just washed the shit.
00:53:04 You've washed the shit.
00:53:06 They've been turned into fucking goo.
00:53:09 Disintegrated.
00:53:10 Whoa, okay.
00:53:11 He's got nice hair.
00:53:12 That's Lieutenant Surge!
00:53:24 This is the very fucking capitalist commentary you come for.
00:53:28 Create a guy who...
00:53:31 His wife just divorced him.
00:53:33 And so he burned down his house with his kids in it.
00:53:37 And now he's on the run.
00:53:40 From the cop killers, because he is a cop.
00:53:43 Oh, yes.
00:53:44 That's a twist.
00:53:45 You know, the only...
00:53:46 You know, when a cop goes bad,
00:53:48 you gotta call him a cop too late.
00:53:52 Regular cops can't hit you.
00:53:54 You're a special branch of the police.
00:53:56 You're a cop too.
00:53:58 You're sanctioned by the fucking city.
00:54:00 Yeah.
00:54:03 Yeah, the ratty fucker is a cop killer.
00:54:05 He's a good boy.
00:54:07 We're civil servants.
00:54:11 Like, with us around, people don't have to live in fear of police brutality.
00:54:17 Really?
00:54:18 All I have to do is wear that Oscar brutality.
00:54:20 The mayor gets, like, a speeding ticket.
00:54:24 Get me the cop killers.
00:54:28 We gotta clean up this city.
00:54:30 Oh, yes, sir.
00:54:32 It's too much.
00:54:34 Our pleasure.
00:54:42 We'll take our payment in the...
00:54:44 We'll take our payment in the...
00:54:46 in the gum, please.
00:54:48 Oh, my God.

00:54:53 Please send one month's worth of rent and pizza.
00:54:59 For every job.
00:55:01 For every, yeah.
00:55:06 Don't make us buy it ourselves.
00:55:08 Pay our rent and give us the pizza.
00:55:11 Yes.
00:55:12 We do not deal in money.
00:55:14 We deal in debt shops.
00:55:16 We do it for the convenience.
00:55:18 You think we got on this job?
00:55:20 We think we got on this job to make money?
00:55:22 We got it, we got it, because we wouldn't have to think about it.
00:55:24 You know, it's easy.
00:55:28 You know, to kill a few cops, live another month.
00:55:52 Yeah.
