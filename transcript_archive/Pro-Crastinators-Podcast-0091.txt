00:01:28 Hello, my honey, hello, my ragtime girl.
00:01:33 Are you the WB frog?
00:01:34 Because that's what I picked.
00:01:35 No, that's not his name.
00:01:36 His name is, oh no, he's got a name.
00:01:39 Let me quickly Google Hat Frogs to find out what's his name.
00:01:43 Homestuck, Munchie.
00:01:44 Oh no, it's Pepe, it's a Naga Hat.
00:01:46 Michigan J Frog.
00:01:47 Michigan J Frog.
00:01:49 Yeah.
00:01:50 What?
00:01:51 Hmm, okay.
00:01:52 Is that real?
00:01:52 Yeah, it's real.
00:01:53 It sounds ridiculous.
00:01:54 Michigan as a name, huh?
00:01:55 I wonder if the J stands for anything.
00:01:57 I'm going to guess that it's Jones because he was created
00:01:59 by Chuck Jones, but that's pure speculation.
00:02:02 Wow, what a character.
00:02:03 What a powerhouse.
00:02:04 He made that up.
00:02:07 Well.
00:02:09 Oh god.
00:02:11 I'm just overcome with love for Michigan J Frog in this machine.
00:02:15 He's a maverick, you know?
00:02:16 He's out there living his dream every single day,
00:02:19 and who in their right mind would stand in his way?
00:02:21 Michigan, Michigan.
00:02:23 Cursed with that forbidden name, unfortunately,
00:02:25 but other than that.
00:02:26 It's all gravy for him.
00:02:29 Anyway, it's 2018, guys.
00:02:32 What?
00:02:33 What?
00:02:34 This is important, shut up, the topic of his podcast.
00:02:37 This is the Michigan J Frog podcast.
00:02:40 In a clip from a DVD special, Jones
00:02:42 stated that he had come up with the name Michigan Frog
00:02:44 during the 1970s and was inspired to add the J
00:02:47 as a middle initial while being interviewed
00:02:49 by a writer named Jay Cox.
00:02:53 Jay Cox.
00:02:54 He was thinking Cox would be a weird one.
00:02:55 So now I'm in question.
00:02:56 Now, does the J stand for Jay as in Jay Cox?
00:03:00 I mean, probably.
00:03:01 Like J-A-Y?
00:03:02 Just like Homer Simpson.
00:03:03 Homer Simpson's middle name is J-A-Y.
00:03:05 Oh, dude, they're related somehow.
00:03:07 They're related just like Monkey D. Luffy and Goldy Roger.
00:03:10 Well, pretty much.
00:03:11 The J. The J is the destiny.
00:03:14 Imagine if the D, it was just D-E-E for all that time.
00:03:19 Dude, Michigan J Frog is a special person.
00:03:21 He's got the will of J.
00:03:24 What if a straw hat land takes place in the same world
00:03:28 as Kirby in the distant future where
00:03:30 King Dedede's descendants have all propagated and spread
00:03:34 throughout the land to overthrow the kingdom of heaven
00:03:36 started by the corrupt.
00:03:37 Wait a minute.
00:03:38 Original founder is Kirby.
00:03:39 That's the last you'll freak.
00:03:41 But wait.
00:03:42 King Dedede is an earth elemental lord of the dancing.
00:03:44 He will see his empire toppled.
00:03:47 And Dedede, in order to make offspring,
00:03:51 effect the year 2018.
00:03:53 So back on topic.
00:03:55 Now that it's legal.
00:03:56 Now that it's legal.
00:03:57 King Dedede.
00:03:59 In Ohio, where I live, 16 is legal.
00:04:01 So just saying.
00:04:03 But in the UK, 16 is legal.
00:04:04 Now I know why you guys live there.
00:04:06 I didn't think of that joke in 2016, but you know.
00:04:08 Did you ever see that meme that's like the Shaq euphoria meme?
00:04:15 Something like, I don't know, Massachusetts,
00:04:18 Age of Consent 18, Midwest, Age of Consent 16, Japan,
00:04:22 Age of Consent 14 or 12.
00:04:24 And then I think it was like Saudi Arabia,
00:04:25 Age of Consent, none.
00:04:27 And it's just like exploding eyes.
00:04:30 It was one of those Middle Eastern states.
00:04:32 I don't mean to insult the good people of Saudi Arabia,
00:04:34 if I'm incorrect.
00:04:35 But anyway, here we are talking Middle Eastern politics.
00:04:40 On today's episode of the Procrastination Podcast.
00:04:42 Wait, I'm going to say I'm going to fucking be racist.
00:04:45 I got beef to pick with Saudi Arabia.
00:04:48 I strongly object to its people and culture.
00:04:49 And our oil prices, they're surging.
00:04:51 Please stop.
00:04:53 No.
00:04:53 Let me tell you why.
00:04:54 It's because I've met a couple of Saudi Arabians in my life.
00:04:58 And they've all been rich assholes
00:05:01 because they have government grants to go abroad
00:05:04 and be rich in another country.
00:05:07 So I'm sure not everyone is like that, but just the ones
00:05:09 that I've been like that.
00:05:11 Yeah, they have a literal aristocracy,
00:05:13 as I understand it, in Saudi Arabia.
00:05:14 Yeah, I'm sure the ones you run into in America
00:05:18 are mostly the rich ones that are like government connected
00:05:21 or whatever.
00:05:23 Indeed.
00:05:24 They're like Dubai, though.
00:05:26 I mean, that's the United Arab Emirates separate.
00:05:28 That's like a literal future.
00:05:30 OK, anyway, it is 2018, guys.
00:05:33 And we're here to talk about our plans for 2018.
00:05:35 Starting the year off with some good old fashioned racism.
00:05:40 It wouldn't be a PCP if we didn't have a little bit of that
00:05:43 mixed in.
00:05:45 Oh, don't say that word.
00:05:47 Don't say mixed here.
00:05:48 Oh, no.
00:05:50 We'll have none of that.
00:05:51 We'll have none of that.
00:05:52 All right, our first goal of 2018
00:05:54 is to help our bro, Richard Spencer,
00:05:57 start the ethno state clearly.
00:06:00 It's time.
00:06:00 The time is upon us.
00:06:02 But really, our first goal is to define what even is 2018.
00:06:07 What could this creature be?
00:06:09 So just for perspective, I went ahead
00:06:11 and we've got our friends at Urban Dictionary
00:06:13 have a definition of 2017 for us.
00:06:16 Oh, you're going to like this one, fellow Redditors.
00:06:18 2017, the struggle for humanity.
00:06:22 Embarrassing, embarrassing.
00:06:24 OK, so that's what we've left behind.
00:06:26 Wait, all right, here's one thing.
00:06:28 I just got to say this.
00:06:30 I don't remember 2017 being bad at all.
00:06:32 I can't remember what happened.
00:06:33 But Donald Trump was president.
00:06:35 He was president at the end of 2016, wasn't he?
00:06:37 Only for a little.
00:06:38 Only for a little bit.
00:06:39 He was elected in 2016.
00:06:41 He was inaugurated in January.
00:06:42 This has been his year.
00:06:44 2017 has such highlights as the release
00:06:47 of our favorite video game, Undertale.
00:06:49 And many other excellent animes.
00:06:55 I just am not understanding the, like, oh my god, 2017.
00:07:00 Will you survive?
00:07:01 Like, what?
00:07:02 Nothing happened.
00:07:03 All to do with the Trump stuff, I'm pretty sure.
00:07:05 It was no 2016.
00:07:07 Like, 2016 was a real shit.
00:07:08 Everybody died that was cool.
00:07:10 That was a bad year.
00:07:11 I fucking died.
00:07:12 That sucked.
00:07:12 Wait, this year?
00:07:13 No, that was 2016.
00:07:15 Yeah.
00:07:15 He died.
00:07:16 God, I can't believe it.
00:07:17 It feels like it was 2016, like, a week ago.
00:07:20 Yeah, exactly.
00:07:21 2017 is exactly not a half-wall.
00:07:23 Because we're closing it on 30.
00:07:26 So our perception of time is beginning to speed up.
00:07:29 Soon it's going to be, I feel that,
00:07:31 decades are going to be a week ago.
00:07:33 Oh, boy.
00:07:34 And we're just going to, like, jeez, Christ.
00:07:36 I better start some, like, Buddhist meditation or something.
00:07:39 That's a good idea.
00:07:41 So here's our definition of 2018 that we'll
00:07:43 be working off of for the rest of this.
00:07:45 I'm sure we will.
00:07:46 Something I hope won't be shit.
00:07:49 Thank you, fellow Redditors.
00:07:51 God.
00:07:51 Tipping my cap to you on my way.
00:07:53 In this trooper's opinion, 2018 is gay.
00:07:56 Let's just go on and define 2018.
00:07:58 Oh, I thought I saw a comic by our good friend Shen Comics.
00:08:03 And if I know anything, 2018 is a very buff naked man
00:08:09 who has a JoJo's-inspired outfit on,
00:08:12 ready to beat the shit out of you.
00:08:14 Is that the Shen Comics?
00:08:15 Is that Bike Cuck?
00:08:16 No, that's Altered.
00:08:19 Altered, the worst comedy game of all time.
00:08:20 No, they're the same thing.
00:08:21 Altered is Shen Comics.
00:08:23 Yeah, yeah, that's OK.
00:08:24 His handle.
00:08:24 OK, there you go.
00:08:25 So, yeah.
00:08:26 Oh, Bike Cuck.
00:08:28 Dude, he totally redeemed himself, though.
00:08:31 He's definitely making some strides.
00:08:33 Every now and then, I see one.
00:08:34 He memed, did you see how he memed on himself
00:08:36 when that new trial they got repealed?
00:08:38 It was fucking brilliant.
00:08:39 I think so, but I can't remember.
00:08:40 What was it again?
00:08:40 He did the exact same comic, but it was like,
00:08:43 net neutrality got repealed.
00:08:44 I'm pretty sad about it.
00:08:46 But then again, maybe the people who repealed him
00:08:47 were having, then he just pops out of a port.
00:08:49 He's like, no, fuck you.
00:08:51 And just beats this shit out of himself.
00:08:53 Like, yeah.
00:08:53 OK.
00:08:54 That was a good way to meme on yourself.
00:08:56 Yeah, I remember appreciating that.
00:08:57 I appreciated that.
00:08:58 You know, I've been seeing these comics on Twitter lately.
00:09:03 They have some generic name.
00:09:05 And they're just drawn as blobs.
00:09:07 And it's like the most generic sentiment.
00:09:09 God, I think it's called webcomicname.
00:09:15 Yeah, it's webcomicname.com.
00:09:17 OK, I get it.
00:09:18 Oh, is it like a parody of all those people who do nothing?
00:09:22 Yeah.
00:09:23 Oh, that's great.
00:09:24 But at the same time, it still manages
00:09:26 to get like the same message across.
00:09:30 It's like, this latest one is, my life has no meaning.
00:09:33 Maybe the meaning of my life is to make an offspring
00:09:36 with a meaningful life.
00:09:37 And then the baby is like, my life has no meaning.
00:09:39 And the parent is like, oh, no.
00:09:41 Yep.
00:09:42 Yep.
00:09:42 I really hate that sentiment about, I don't know,
00:09:46 does anybody else feel similar?
00:09:47 This is sort of relevant.
00:09:48 Try like goals for a new year, whatever.
00:09:50 I, whenever I see a parent who like defines their life
00:09:54 by like raising their kid right, it makes me real mad.
00:09:57 Yeah, it's like, if everyone does that, nothing new happens.
00:10:01 It's just the same shit forever.
00:10:03 And I'm, I don't know.
00:10:04 Well, don't you find it weird that like parents would be like,
00:10:06 I'm going to raise my child, right?
00:10:07 But then they raise them with the exact same like values
00:10:10 and goals that they had, which led them nowhere.
00:10:12 So it's just like, you're just pigeonholing your child
00:10:14 into being as MD and vapid as you are.
00:10:16 I've given up on the, on the hope that like,
00:10:18 I'll be a miraculously way better parent than like my parents.
00:10:21 We're like, what are the odds that I'm going to crack
00:10:23 the fucking code and be like a magically perfect parent
00:10:26 who makes the perfect kid?
00:10:27 Highly unlikely.
00:10:28 No, if anyone could do it, it's me.
00:10:30 I'm a gambling man.
00:10:31 I, if I make a kid, I'm going to, I'm going to just go into it
00:10:35 with the, with the idea of like making them into somebody
00:10:38 I can have a conversation with that is not like,
00:10:41 uh, God, this fucking piece of shit.
00:10:43 I'm not going to, you know, this isn't the parents.
00:10:46 Impossible.
00:10:47 Impossible.
00:10:48 Yeah.
00:10:49 There's a generational divide.
00:10:51 So from like, you know, like 13 to like 25,
00:10:55 they're going to hate you.
00:10:57 What I mean, what I mean by that is,
00:10:59 is giving them like the, the tools of like
00:11:04 figuring things out on their own.
00:11:07 So that they can be an interesting person
00:11:10 without doing what I do or like knowing what I know.
00:11:13 I don't know how to explain this,
00:11:14 but I don't want to talk about it.
00:11:15 I don't want to get into it.
00:11:16 Because that's, I'm not going to do it in 2018.
00:11:18 That's for sure.
00:11:19 The best, the best way to, the best thing you can do for a kid.
00:11:22 Give a man a fish, feed him for a day,
00:11:25 teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime,
00:11:27 teach a man to catfish, get him economically secure
00:11:31 for the remainder of his existence.
00:11:33 That's relevant somehow, I think.
00:11:37 So what do you guys got for goals?
00:11:39 You got any new year's resolutions,
00:11:40 any hot off the press kind of stuff?
00:11:43 People have been doing that a lot.
00:11:44 People have been doing that a lot around here.
00:11:46 I don't know, I don't really trust them.
00:11:48 I don't really trust them.
00:11:49 Like, I mean, of course I'm a gym guy.
00:11:51 So like every January, the January joiners flood the gym
00:11:54 and it's a nightmare.
00:11:55 Every, every workout guy goes, that's like the worst time.
00:11:57 The January joiners and it's bullshit.
00:11:59 Cause they, cause they flake out.
00:12:01 They flake out.
00:12:02 Cause if you're just, if you're just there, cause like,
00:12:06 yeah, like you're not, you're not gonna stick to it
00:12:08 based on like, oh, I can't let down my new year's resolution.
00:12:12 That principle is what, is what kind of turns me off
00:12:15 of new year's resolutions in general.
00:12:17 Don't get me wrong, any excuse to try to work on something
00:12:20 is an opportunity that maybe this will be the time
00:12:22 that you really stick to it.
00:12:23 And I'm all for that.
00:12:25 But like if your primary motivation is just to stick
00:12:28 to your own desire to stick to your new year's resolution,
00:12:31 to me, sounds like a, a rocky foundation,
00:12:33 but maybe you can build on it.
00:12:34 You know what they should do?
00:12:35 They should, they should have all the gyms in the world
00:12:38 have like a, like a four mile radius all around them.
00:12:42 And with like spikes on the roads that you can't drive
00:12:44 over them, over the border.
00:12:47 And you have to run all the way to the gym
00:12:49 cause there's lines and shit.
00:12:50 So if you manage, if you have like the, the, the tenacity
00:12:54 to run all the way to the gym to do your workout,
00:12:57 then you've proven yourself worthy to be in the gym.
00:13:00 It's like a Pokemon gym because you got to go through
00:13:02 the gym leaders minions before you fight the gym leader.
00:13:06 You got, you got to show that you can beat that diglet
00:13:09 before you can fight against Brock and his mighty Onyx.
00:13:13 That sounds like a dick metaphor if I ever heard one.
00:13:17 I don't know.
00:13:19 A dig, you know, diglet, Onyx, whatever.
00:13:23 Point is, I have no resolutions though.
00:13:27 I have been thinking about like fixing my diet forever.
00:13:30 That's, that's one thing I'd really like to do this year.
00:13:32 And like, here's the thing about me.
00:13:34 Everything that I should be doing, I'm already doing
00:13:37 in terms of finances economically because I recognize
00:13:40 there's no point in waiting.
00:13:41 You just got to do it and don't be a pussy.
00:13:42 But one thing that I am not really doing perfectly
00:13:45 is, is eating exactly as I would like to
00:13:47 for maximizing gains and maximizing health.
00:13:51 Not, not quite enough kidney beans these days
00:13:52 and not enough salads and too many carbs, far too many carbs
00:13:56 as everyone does in America.
00:13:58 Yeah, I want to, I want to knock that shit off.
00:14:00 So that's, that's something I'm kind of keeping.
00:14:01 Carbs, I hate carbs.
00:14:03 I, I've came to a revelation recently.
00:14:05 Yeah, for the last, well, here's the thing.
00:14:07 This is, this is the catch 22 or horrible situation
00:14:10 I'm in with carbohydrates because like you,
00:14:12 I've been trying to improve my diet.
00:14:14 So for the last like couple months from like,
00:14:19 I want to say August to probably the end of October,
00:14:24 I was having migraines all the time.
00:14:26 Like I have, I've had chronic migraines
00:14:28 since I was five years old, but like they were really bad.
00:14:30 Like so bad.
00:14:31 Like I was like, I don't know if this is migraine.
00:14:33 Like it's so much worse.
00:14:34 I went to the hospital like three times.
00:14:35 I was like, there's nothing wrong with you.
00:14:36 Like, you know, like you're fucked up.
00:14:38 And I eventually figured out the reason,
00:14:40 the reason that I was getting all these migraines
00:14:43 was because I wasn't eating enough carbs.
00:14:45 I was trying to lower my carb intake.
00:14:47 And because I wasn't having as many carbs
00:14:49 that like made my headaches worse.
00:14:50 And then I looked it up and like, yeah,
00:14:51 this thing kind of happens.
00:14:52 People have like chronic migraines.
00:14:53 Like you have to like carb load
00:14:55 to keep your headaches away.
00:14:57 I'm like, whoa, I'm totally fucked.
00:14:59 Is that because you're eating far less
00:15:01 than the average person does?
00:15:02 Or because there's something about you
00:15:03 where you need more carbs than the average person?
00:15:05 I'm not sure.
00:15:06 It's interesting because I wasn't,
00:15:07 I wasn't having like no carbs.
00:15:09 I was just like cutting down on it.
00:15:11 And that was enough to like make like something that was like,
00:15:15 I'd get like three or four times a month
00:15:17 to be like three or four times a week.
00:15:21 And like made it impossible to function.
00:15:23 So my own body is deciding to fuck over my resolution
00:15:28 to eat better.
00:15:28 So thanks, thanks biology.
00:15:31 Where's genetic engineering?
00:15:32 Or even better, where's the robot bodies?
00:15:34 We need the cyber brains now, all right.
00:15:36 That indeed, indeed.
00:15:40 Okay, well, does that translate
00:15:41 any kind of resolution for this year?
00:15:42 Any plans for that?
00:15:44 Well, I want to try and find a better balance for that.
00:15:46 And I also want to start exercising a little bit.
00:15:49 I feel like if I go into,
00:15:50 if I turn 30 as a flabby fuck,
00:15:53 I'm just probably just going to kill myself on my birthday.
00:15:56 Just like, can't let it happen.
00:15:58 Can't let it happen.
00:16:00 It's been too long, like I can't.
00:16:03 Okay, the best way to do that is set the date
00:16:05 that you know is the day that you're going to kill yourself
00:16:07 and break up all the time from now to then
00:16:09 into small achievable goals.
00:16:11 And so you can track your progress.
00:16:12 And even if you don't achieve all the way,
00:16:14 you'll have come a long way by then.
00:16:16 And if I don't get all the way,
00:16:18 I'll just like cut off an arm instead of just straight.
00:16:20 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:16:23 Your death will be proportional.
00:16:25 Yeah, consequences.
00:16:26 I'll just like poison myself,
00:16:28 so I'll die in like a few years, you know.
00:16:30 Okay, okay, if I hit it bit,
00:16:33 if I make a million dollars by the time I'm 30,
00:16:36 if I don't make a million dollars by the time I'm 30,
00:16:38 I'm going to kill myself.
00:16:38 But if I make say 500,000,
00:16:41 I'll just start smoking instead.
00:16:42 Yeah, cut off a proportional amount of your life
00:16:45 by engaging in bad activities.
00:16:47 Gabe, were you saying something?
00:16:49 No.
00:16:50 I don't know what this thing is.
00:16:51 I don't know what we're doing.
00:16:52 Are we just saying resolutions?
00:16:54 We're saying things we've got goals for 2018.
00:16:55 I mean, right now we're talking
00:16:56 about New Year's resolutions, basically.
00:16:57 Yeah, cause let me talk about anything here.
00:16:58 Because those are slightly different
00:17:00 in that they feel, even the word,
00:17:05 like it just feels like,
00:17:07 yeah, I'm not actually going to do that,
00:17:08 but I'm saying it.
00:17:09 Do you want to know why?
00:17:10 This is why New Year's resolutions are stupid
00:17:12 and why goals are good.
00:17:13 Because of resolution, you're just like,
00:17:16 oh, I resolved to do something.
00:17:17 This is something I'd like to do.
00:17:18 It's not committal enough.
00:17:20 A goal is when you're just like, okay,
00:17:21 I not only do I have something I've resolved to do,
00:17:24 but I assumedly have some sort of plan in place
00:17:27 to get there.
00:17:28 And so I can make these smaller steps to accomplish it.
00:17:32 That's the difference.
00:17:32 That's why goals are good and resolutions are bullshit.
00:17:35 Because so many people are just like,
00:17:37 they have, you have your resolution,
00:17:38 like the day of like, you know, like December 31st,
00:17:41 like I'm going to go to the gym tomorrow.
00:17:42 And then like that's as far as you planned out.
00:17:44 That's not going to work, dude.
00:17:45 You got to have a system in place
00:17:47 or you're fucking yourself over.
00:17:48 I just, I can't respect someone who says,
00:17:51 I mean, I don't know if theoretically perhaps I could,
00:17:54 but it seems like a big bad mistake to be like,
00:17:57 yeah, on January 1st, I start going to the gym
00:17:59 and it's like, it's like the middle of December.
00:18:01 Like if you really are committed,
00:18:02 you'll start today or maybe tomorrow,
00:18:05 like, I don't know, whatever,
00:18:06 but you'll start now.
00:18:07 You won't wait until then.
00:18:09 That's, you know, it's the way to fucking do it.
00:18:11 That's the way to fucking do it.
00:18:12 I mean, my resolution or rather goal was,
00:18:16 I mentioned it in the last PCP of the questions
00:18:18 when we mentioned like plans and stuff,
00:18:21 but we're going to go more into it here.
00:18:22 I mentioned that I was going to make videos every week
00:18:25 and stuff.
00:18:26 And the reason I was going to start on January the first
00:18:28 was because I had work that I couldn't,
00:18:31 like I had to get done
00:18:33 and that I was stopping me from starting immediately.
00:18:37 So basically my goal was to finish what I had to finish
00:18:40 by the 31st of December,
00:18:42 which I actually on the last day of the year finished.
00:18:46 And I was like, oh, ooh.
00:18:48 And now I can just celebrate for a bit.
00:18:51 And then I actually, January 1st, I did work
00:18:54 and I was working.
00:18:55 And I was working the second day and the third day.
00:18:57 And this whole first week, my plan was,
00:19:01 well, my goals, my, yeah, my plan for 2018
00:19:06 was to make a video every week.
00:19:08 And as of the first week, I have done two videos
00:19:10 and I'm starting the third after I've finished recording this.
00:19:14 So it's going well.
00:19:15 And at the rate I am going, I can imagine,
00:19:19 like one week I can do two videos
00:19:22 and I have four videos per month, basically.
00:19:25 So by June, I should have the whole fucking year,
00:19:28 fucking dumb.
00:19:29 Sick dog.
00:19:30 Yeah, I mean, that's great.
00:19:31 Yeah, I mean, of course, if you are just like,
00:19:33 if you're busy accomplishing other goals
00:19:36 that prevent you from starting until January 1st,
00:19:38 you know, of course.
00:19:39 Yeah, immediately means as soon as it's feasibly possible.
00:19:42 Not like. Indeed, indeed.
00:19:43 You're drowning.
00:19:44 It's time to start working on that video.
00:19:46 You know, if you're not starting right now,
00:19:48 trying to present yourself from drowning,
00:19:49 like I'm pretty sure you're a terrible person.
00:19:51 Drowning in footwear, though.
00:19:54 Oh, well, you know.
00:19:55 Got him.
00:19:56 Got him.
00:19:57 That's a realm I'm not familiar with, let me say.
00:19:59 That's a level of existence I can't fathom.
00:20:02 Ben, you got any resolutions for 2018?
00:20:05 Tell me them.
00:20:07 I guess, well, on a personal note,
00:20:10 I guess my overall, the thing that I'm aiming
00:20:13 to start doing that I wasn't doing previously in 2018
00:20:16 is start paying my student loans off.
00:20:18 They've been deferred.
00:20:19 Hey, glad to hear it, dude.
00:20:21 Yeah, they've been deferred forever, and that's bad.
00:20:24 I made a big payment on them a couple years ago,
00:20:27 and I'm pretty sure that a bunch of what I paid back then
00:20:30 has grown back to interest, which is very,
00:20:33 not all of it, but yeah, it's very frustrating.
00:20:36 And like, I don't know.
00:20:37 I have been roasting you, Ben, behind your back
00:20:40 for years about these student loans,
00:20:42 just so you know, roasting you like a Christmas goose
00:20:46 you were, and succulent, succulent,
00:20:50 the word I'd use to describe it.
00:20:52 Well, yeah, so I'm gonna do, and like,
00:20:55 I'm not hemorrhaging money anymore, like I once was,
00:21:00 so yeah, I can start doing that,
00:21:03 and I'm sure that will be a smart and I won't regret it.
00:21:07 Our dear departed papa would have been so pleased
00:21:10 to hear this news.
00:21:12 Good, yes.
00:21:15 I'm glad that he'll be happy, and I'm glad that he's dead.
00:21:18 Yeah.
00:21:24 Yeah, sick.
00:21:25 Is he actually dead?
00:21:26 Ben, make the same joke in the drug cast.
00:21:28 No, you ding dong.
00:21:29 That was his ghost.
00:21:30 He drew a picture of his ghost.
00:21:31 Oh, I don't know.
00:21:34 I don't hear from your dad that much.
00:21:36 Is that true?
00:21:37 So, therefore, he must be dead.
00:21:40 A munchie, however, is in close communication
00:21:42 with everyone's dad, and is keeping tabs on all of them.
00:21:45 He's got the big map with all the red strings,
00:21:48 triangulating locations at any given time.
00:21:51 Right, anyway, is that everyone?
00:21:55 Has everyone said, I don't know,
00:21:56 we did resolutions, I do wanna talk about larger goals.
00:21:59 Goals are far more interesting.
00:22:01 Yeah, yeah, I don't know, I guess let's get into it.
00:22:07 Ben just basically said one of his,
00:22:09 but what's your big plan for 2018?
00:22:12 What are you gonna be producing
00:22:14 over the course of this year?
00:22:15 What'll be on the other side?
00:22:16 I have a few things.
00:22:19 My stupid fun little comics that I do
00:22:23 over on APSadventures.workpress.com.
00:22:28 What does that stand for again?
00:22:30 Adobe Photoshop Adventures.
00:22:31 Oh yeah, that's right.
00:22:34 Yeah, I did one during a stream,
00:22:37 like I drew a whole comic, and it was like,
00:22:39 ah, that's fun, I'll do it again.
00:22:40 I did another one, it's not finished yet,
00:22:42 but I wanna do more of that,
00:22:44 but that's obviously time consuming,
00:22:45 and it's fun, but it's not really a product
00:22:50 that I can be like, yeah, I could turn this into a real thing.
00:22:54 So I kinda just, well, I mean, it doesn't look very good,
00:22:57 and I'm not that good at drawing yet.
00:22:59 Just fucking print it as a zine.
00:23:01 Oh, what's that?
00:23:04 It's a zine, dude.
00:23:05 What's a zine?
00:23:06 It's a zine, dude.
00:23:08 It's like a cheap fan magazine.
00:23:11 It's like a one man show, sort of thing.
00:23:13 Yeah, you know, that 80s style Xerox grunge kind of aesthetic.
00:23:20 I mean, last year I had this idea
00:23:22 that I would make an album, a book, and something,
00:23:26 maybe a comic.
00:23:27 And a baby this year.
00:23:28 No, no, no, disgraceful.
00:23:31 I'm a baby, baby, it's you, it's you.
00:23:35 I mean, that is something, you know.
00:23:37 Not like making the baby,
00:23:38 but like getting the v-cards punched, that's something.
00:23:41 Yeah, oh, I'll give you a punch, all right.
00:23:43 Just come over to my crib someday.
00:23:46 You'll get that v-card abused heavily.
00:23:49 Yes, but like what I want is I want to continue doing
00:23:52 those comics to the point where I have so much of them
00:23:55 that I can actually release a big old book of them,
00:23:59 like just like Homestuck.
00:24:00 Just like Homestuck is in a funny book,
00:24:03 but it's not as good as like it's looking at it online
00:24:06 because there's so many flash pages and GIFs.
00:24:09 But I bought the Homestuck book and I'm reading it.
00:24:11 I'm like, this will be good to have one of these.
00:24:14 Hey, I've been wondering just about that book.
00:24:17 Ben has the first two Homestuck books,
00:24:19 but I read them, but I can't remember.
00:24:21 No, I don't think I have any Homestuck books,
00:24:22 but I have all the Problem Sleuth books.
00:24:24 Oh, shit. Yeah, those are good.
00:24:27 So like with the GIFs,
00:24:29 with like the high super fast GIFs of Homestuck,
00:24:32 I'm imagining that what Hussie does is on one page,
00:24:35 he puts the first frame, on the next page,
00:24:37 he puts the second, instructions are flip
00:24:39 at extreme speed back and forth between these.
00:24:43 Not actually.
00:24:45 I mean, it's a lot of the layout is kind of like terrible
00:24:48 because you can't accurately show,
00:24:52 because like a lot of the stuff in Homestuck
00:24:54 is like it moves across the screen real fast,
00:24:56 but what is moving across the screen
00:24:58 doesn't look like it's like drawn to be moving.
00:25:01 It's just a thing being dragged like really fast.
00:25:03 So it's like, it's great in motion.
00:25:04 It looks terrible like in what do you call them?
00:25:09 Thumbnails.
00:25:10 It's like with those animation super sleuths,
00:25:13 do you have a frame capture on like one blurred
00:25:16 motion animation or like exposed.
00:25:19 This is a terrible anime, et cetera, et cetera.
00:25:22 Yeah, but yeah, I want to draw a bunch of comics
00:25:25 because those are more fun than trying to write a book.
00:25:29 I might do music as well, I don't know.
00:25:31 Basically what I want to do is I want to get
00:25:33 all hypocrite stuff done.
00:25:34 Hillary was the breakout hit of 2017.
00:25:36 Hillary was a pretty funny one,
00:25:38 but it's not that good to listen to.
00:25:40 And it was made in a day, that whole album.
00:25:42 If I make like, if I do like a month of like
00:25:45 doing a song in a day, that might be actually pretty great.
00:25:49 Yeah, yeah.
00:25:49 So, you know, I just, yeah, I just want to do
00:25:54 creative stuff that I like.
00:25:56 And in order to facilitate that,
00:25:58 I need to get hypocrite stuff done earlier
00:26:02 so that I have months and months where I can just like,
00:26:04 hmm, think about stuff and things.
00:26:07 Yeah, you gotta stick with this school.
00:26:09 My plan is to be creative and facilitate
00:26:12 the ability to be creative.
00:26:16 Respect.
00:26:17 The noblest of goals.
00:26:18 Yeah, that's just a good overarching life goal
00:26:22 to have that informs everything else that you do.
00:26:24 That's basically my life pattern for myself, more or less.
00:26:28 I'm sure you guys as well.
00:26:30 Like everything that I do,
00:26:32 every individual thing that I do
00:26:34 is done with the understanding that like,
00:26:37 this is a good idea, if and only if,
00:26:39 it in some way contributes to like,
00:26:42 that more of my future life will be spent
00:26:45 pursuing my own artistic endeavors.
00:26:48 Yeah, yeah.
00:26:49 And I mean, artistic endeavors, sure,
00:26:51 but I am always very conscious of.
00:26:54 Or just my own endeavors, like doing what I want to do.
00:26:57 Yeah, sure, sure.
00:26:58 I'm just very conscious personally
00:27:00 of I have a baseline economic reality I need to meet.
00:27:03 I need to achieve that.
00:27:05 And once I'm over that,
00:27:06 then I have a lot more flexibility to do whatever I want.
00:27:08 Yeah.
00:27:09 That's how I approach it.
00:27:12 Yeah.
00:27:13 There's really no more like detailed,
00:27:15 I mean, I guess I could go into some details
00:27:17 of like some videos I plan to make.
00:27:19 If you want to.
00:27:21 But I don't know how long I could talk about that for,
00:27:24 because it's just.
00:27:25 You maybe take one that you want to share,
00:27:26 if you do want to share any of them.
00:27:28 Well, I don't mind sharing the ones.
00:27:29 It's basically I want to go over all the hypocrite videos
00:27:34 that were like the first in a series,
00:27:36 like Ratchet and Clank and Jack and Daxter
00:27:38 and Kingdom Hearts and stuff.
00:27:40 And I do the sequels to those.
00:27:42 So I would do GRPJ on Kingdom Hearts 2.
00:27:45 I would do a review of Rayman 2 and Ape Escape 2
00:27:48 and Ratchet and Clank 2 and Jack and Daxter 2.
00:27:51 And it'd just be like, I'm better at videos now.
00:27:54 And here's these popular games that everyone likes
00:27:57 clicking on.
00:27:58 And they'll all be good.
00:27:59 You need to release all those on a Tuesday.
00:28:01 Oh, whoa, that's a good idea.
00:28:05 That's a fun gimmick.
00:28:06 I might do that.
00:28:09 Excellent.
00:28:11 Yeah, all right.
00:28:12 That's cool.
00:28:13 I don't know.
00:28:14 I'm looking forward to it.
00:28:16 It's gonna be a good year.
00:28:17 It's gonna be a good year, I think, for all of us.
00:28:20 Ben's Kickstarter is wrapping up.
00:28:22 My Kickstarter. It's not done yet.
00:28:24 Oh, God, I want today.
00:28:27 Since you bring it up, I just want to say that today,
00:28:29 this very day, is the last day of my Kickstarter.
00:28:33 Oh, yeah?
00:28:34 When you, the listener, are listening to this.
00:28:37 So go to my fucking Twitter, link in the description.
00:28:41 We're fucking going for the final stretch goal,
00:28:43 which is that I buy a fucking Oculus Rift
00:28:45 and turn memes into reality.
00:28:49 Make the dream real.
00:28:50 Yes, make the dream real.
00:28:52 Send me surfing down the VR superhighway.
00:28:54 Ben, you know, if you want to sell that
00:28:57 as something actually meaningful,
00:28:59 you know there's a VR program for Oculus Rift
00:29:01 where you can draw in VR and 3D,
00:29:03 so you can walk around the drawing
00:29:05 as you're drawing it and stuff.
00:29:07 I have seen it.
00:29:08 Yeah, I mean, if I get a,
00:29:10 I don't even know what I do with an Oculus Rift,
00:29:12 but I would, you can probably, you finally live.
00:29:14 You have just post photos on Twitter with it
00:29:18 and then mention, map every time.
00:29:22 I mean, I owe it all to him, man.
00:29:23 I owe it all to him.
00:29:25 He sparks the creative drive in you to get to the point
00:29:31 where you could buy an Oculus Rift.
00:29:33 That's true.
00:29:34 And they say capitalism doesn't work.
00:29:36 Yeah, excellent, excellent.
00:29:38 So Ben's going to get an Oculus Rift.
00:29:39 That's his goal for 2018.
00:29:40 Yeah, what I'm saying is that's my goal for 2018.
00:29:42 I can't wait for the Rowdy Funkers Cop Killers episode
00:29:44 all in VR. Oh my God.
00:29:46 Oh, the Oculus Rift theme.
00:29:47 Rowdy Funkers episode.
00:29:49 A five hour free video.
00:29:51 How could I not have thought of that?
00:29:53 Of course, of course.
00:29:54 Oh, that's the capstone of the saga.
00:29:56 Oh my God.
00:29:57 We got to get Munchy one too.
00:29:59 We got to get Munchy one too.
00:30:00 There's another special, dude.
00:30:02 We can fucking have VR adventures.
00:30:04 Guys, please get Ben this Oculus Rift.
00:30:07 So this can be real.
00:30:08 Please.
00:30:10 Yes.
00:30:11 I mean, this was just a fucking joke,
00:30:13 but now that we're talking about it,
00:30:14 the actual real world possibilities are just staggering.
00:30:20 Oh shit.
00:30:21 All this corruption will have been true all along.
00:30:23 This is all part of Ben's long game.
00:30:25 He's been playing the long con here.
00:30:27 I'm always playing the long con.
00:30:28 He's joking.
00:30:29 We all act like this is just spur of the moment,
00:30:31 but no, inside there's a calculated psychopath.
00:30:33 We just made those statements,
00:30:35 and then we didn't see, because we're on a podcast,
00:30:38 Ben, like it was a freeze frame,
00:30:40 but it turned red like death though.
00:30:42 And he's like, it's all according to plan.
00:30:43 I didn't have to say anything about the benefits
00:30:46 of the Oculus Rift.
00:30:47 They said it for me.
00:30:48 So I'm totally in the clear.
00:30:50 I don't look like the bad guy.
00:30:51 Dude, when Ben touches the Oculus Rift,
00:30:53 just like it does in all his memories,
00:30:55 he's come flooding back with his own plan.
00:30:56 But he's suppressed with his fucking mind,
00:30:58 and he's like, just as good as new.
00:31:01 Oh my God.
00:31:02 He's gonna be the god of the VR world.
00:31:05 Yeah, the god of the VR world.
00:31:08 Oh my God.
00:31:09 And Munchie's re-euk, right?
00:31:11 Oh yes, oh it's perfect with his fat little body
00:31:14 with his little wings floating around.
00:31:17 Only instead of eating apples,
00:31:18 he eats a disgusting fast food food.
00:31:21 And it's, oh, it's whole pizzas.
00:31:24 Whole pizzas, oh, incredible.
00:31:28 You know, that just gets me thinking.
00:31:30 The wheels spinning in my head of like,
00:31:32 what we could do with that at a Radcon,
00:31:35 at a Radcon, at a place with the procrastinators.
00:31:38 That's sort of a goal
00:31:39 that is not like individual to any one of us,
00:31:41 but that's something that could like begin to,
00:31:45 I mean, I don't know.
00:31:46 We don't have like big plans.
00:31:47 That's the 2018 goal for all of you, the listeners,
00:31:50 to go to patreon.com slash the procrastinators,
00:31:53 give generously and make it happen.
00:31:57 It's true, man.
00:31:57 I want to meet up with my good boy, baby friends,
00:32:00 and suck everyone's dick.
00:32:03 That's what I want to do.
00:32:05 Indeed.
00:32:06 I think we're pretty firmly out of any Kickstarter jail
00:32:10 that we may have been in up to this point.
00:32:12 And I think that, yeah, man, the door's wide open.
00:32:15 And of course, not to mention,
00:32:18 like Digi's got plans to be moving sometime this year.
00:32:21 Things for me are looking way up in general
00:32:23 in terms of just like my YouTube success
00:32:26 and just like my economic stability.
00:32:28 Just getting closer.
00:32:29 I'm already above like technically a livable wage,
00:32:33 but it's lower than I'm comfortable doing at the moment.
00:32:36 So I gotta keep working, gotta keep grinding,
00:32:39 earn a little bit more,
00:32:40 and then once I'm at that point,
00:32:41 my student loans, they're getting way down there, dude.
00:32:44 They're way down there.
00:32:45 And they will, these will 100% be paid off in this year,
00:32:50 in this year without a question.
00:32:51 So that is very exciting for me.
00:32:53 I will no longer be a negative financial boy.
00:32:56 I will finally be positive.
00:32:57 And that's-
00:32:58 You'll finally be in the black.
00:33:01 Wait, what was the pause thing you just said?
00:33:02 Is that like that?
00:33:03 Is that that thing about like people who like to get aides?
00:33:06 Yes.
00:33:07 And it's like sexy for me?
00:33:08 Yeah, you're right.
00:33:09 That means you're, you know.
00:33:09 That's what I was saying.
00:33:10 You've got the gift to give.
00:33:12 I've got the gift, the gift, that's the one.
00:33:14 The gift, yes.
00:33:16 Well, the gift is the bug.
00:33:17 The two are one and the same.
00:33:19 Right?
00:33:23 God damn.
00:33:25 Degeneracy is really in a spiral right now in 2018.
00:33:28 It's the in thing to do.
00:33:31 The fact that it is the in thing to,
00:33:33 well, okay, I'm exaggerating a little bit,
00:33:35 but yeah, what the fuck, guys?
00:33:36 It's definitely you.
00:33:37 Please stop.
00:33:41 Let me see, what else am I doing?
00:33:43 Hey, I got plans.
00:33:44 I got some plans.
00:33:45 Weagua is proving to be a pretty strong success so far.
00:33:48 It's the content that I think I was more or less destined
00:33:53 to do, just some sort of regular content
00:33:55 to force me to make stuff.
00:33:56 Just, it's just like back in the T-Bap days.
00:33:58 I was forced to make an episode every week
00:34:00 and it forced me to get a little creative.
00:34:02 It's been really good for me.
00:34:03 So I'm gonna keep doing that for forever, for the next while.
00:34:07 And in the meantime.
00:34:08 Which ever comes first.
00:34:10 Indeed, indeed.
00:34:11 And just do it.
00:34:12 I don't know, for me, I'm pretty much staying the course
00:34:14 and just like trying to like grow
00:34:15 and everything's going very well for me.
00:34:18 So I'm just doing what I'm doing.
00:34:20 No surprises.
00:34:20 Though there will be surprises in terms of content
00:34:23 that people see for me in 2018.
00:34:25 Especially if I am able to go full time
00:34:28 and I'm finally set free to spend all my time
00:34:30 working on content.
00:34:31 Oh man, you guys don't even know.
00:34:33 I've been saying this forever.
00:34:34 The content that I work on every day
00:34:37 that is coming sometime soon.
00:34:39 When, when it goes to the show.
00:34:45 That is a good question.
00:34:46 Who knows man?
00:34:47 When it's one piece Nate, we filmed it like 60 years ago.
00:34:51 Oh shit, Ben was that, didn't even know that.
00:34:53 Ben helped Ben.
00:34:54 Dude, I got incredible footage that day.
00:34:56 You, we certainly did.
00:34:58 The footage was ridiculous. I did.
00:35:00 Yeah, Ben held the camera, Ben held the camera.
00:35:02 It was me.
00:35:05 Someday soon, someday soon everybody.
00:35:07 2018, 2018, that's something you can mark
00:35:10 on your fucking calendar this year.
00:35:13 A promise.
00:35:13 The whole year, mark the whole year on your calendar.
00:35:16 At some point.
00:35:17 Yeah, block out this whole space of time
00:35:18 from January 1st to December 31st.
00:35:20 You're gonna wanna have that time booked for me.
00:35:23 Cause I'm gonna be filling it.
00:35:25 Every orifice.
00:35:27 Just like your hero, Shadman.
00:35:29 Every hole is a goal.
00:35:32 Every hole is a goal.
00:35:33 You know, I respect Shadman as a businessman
00:35:36 and as a rebel and as an entrepreneur.
00:35:38 But his art is, I am growing a little bit out of favor
00:35:42 with the art itself.
00:35:43 Well, that's what he, you were just telling me
00:35:46 how he's your hero and your favorite person
00:35:48 you aspire just to be like him.
00:35:49 Because he has the audacity of hope
00:35:52 to quote my hero, Barack Obama.
00:35:54 Or was that Hillary Clinton?
00:35:55 I can't remember.
00:35:56 No, that was.
00:35:57 You know, he is a literal internationally wanted criminal
00:36:01 as I understand it.
00:36:02 Wait, what?
00:36:03 And he just doesn't give a fuck
00:36:04 and he just keeps drawing lolliporn.
00:36:05 Why is he an internationally wanted criminal?
00:36:08 Because he draws lolliporn.
00:36:10 I thought it was because he had a fucking scary skull.
00:36:14 They're cracking down on skulls in Europe
00:36:16 in a big way right now.
00:36:18 But yeah, he's just like,
00:36:19 if his identity was revealed, he'd be real fucked.
00:36:22 And I just, I don't know, he just has a passion
00:36:24 and he's uncompromising in his devotion to it.
00:36:27 And I really respect that.
00:36:29 That's all.
00:36:30 That's pretty neat, honestly.
00:36:31 Yeah, super neat.
00:36:32 And he carved out his own space.
00:36:34 Yeah, he's kind of a hero, kind of a hero.
00:36:37 But anyway.
00:36:38 All right, that's what I'm doing.
00:36:40 That's what I'm doing.
00:36:41 What about you, Tom?
00:36:43 I have a lot of stuff going on in 2018, hopefully.
00:36:46 I think the big thing for this year, like macro goal,
00:36:50 is just like focus.
00:36:53 Cause last year I did a bunch of things
00:36:54 and it was a clusterfuck and I hated it and it sucked.
00:36:58 So I just, I killed off one of my YouTube channels.
00:37:01 I was running two of them.
00:37:02 So last week, I put the kebab
00:37:04 wash on Rebel Pixels cause I, it'd been like months
00:37:06 and no one had sent me anything.
00:37:07 No one responded to my emails.
00:37:09 And it was just a distraction at this point anyway.
00:37:10 Cause the Patreon never got any money.
00:37:13 It was just like, it was a lot of time to make those videos
00:37:16 and as informative and as helpful they were
00:37:19 to thousands of people, they didn't pay me anything.
00:37:21 So fuck it.
00:37:23 So.
00:37:24 Rest in peace, Rebel Pixels.
00:37:25 So that, that went away.
00:37:26 And I'm just focusing on 3D this year.
00:37:29 So my old channel, which is not my new channel again,
00:37:33 it's all about 3D.
00:37:34 So I'm going to do analysis videos on 3D.
00:37:39 Yeah.
00:37:40 Your Berserk series is going along swimmingly as I saw.
00:37:42 Yeah.
00:37:43 I'm going to work on today on a, a, a interlude
00:37:46 on land of the lustrous cause no one will fucking shut up
00:37:50 in the comments about who built land of the lustrous.
00:37:52 It proves everything you're saying.
00:37:53 Oh, that's who's so sick, you know, Coney, right?
00:37:55 That's, that's what that is.
00:37:56 Yeah, right.
00:37:57 So of course, like.
00:37:58 I also just downloaded that today.
00:37:59 It's, it's fucking amazing.
00:38:00 I watched it.
00:38:01 It's great.
00:38:02 The month after I start the series, you know,
00:38:05 Joseki Nocuni drops and like everyone's like,
00:38:07 Oh, well now anime, 3D anime has always been amazing
00:38:10 because this one show is great.
00:38:11 And we never shit on it ever.
00:38:12 Berserk just happened guys.
00:38:14 Berserk just happened.
00:38:15 Let's not forget.
00:38:16 Well, the thing is like, I have like clips from like
00:38:18 dozens of 3D shows that all have like the same like
00:38:20 kind of weirdness to them.
00:38:22 And then like the next part is going to talk about 3D anime
00:38:24 and video games and how that's kind of looks weird sometimes.
00:38:27 But this one show, of course.
00:38:30 So I got to, I got to put the whole series proper on hold
00:38:32 and be like, all right, you peasants.
00:38:34 You know, I watched some of Joseki Nocuni just in clips.
00:38:36 I didn't think it was like perfectly.
00:38:37 It's still a little bit uncanny valley, but, but anyway,
00:38:39 I'm sorry, I don't mean to.
00:38:40 It's much, it's much, it's much better for sure.
00:38:44 And I got some real laughs.
00:38:45 There's, there's some good stuff in there for sure.
00:38:46 It's, it's fucking great.
00:38:47 So I'm working on that series.
00:38:49 And then I'm also doing more animation,
00:38:51 just like making 3D.
00:38:52 So the whole channel is going to be on making 3D
00:38:54 and talking about it and just enjoying 3D as an art form.
00:38:57 There's one problem with your whole, a business model here.
00:39:00 And it's that 3D pig disgusting Tom, 2D waifu for life.
00:39:04 You need to re-configure your whole life.
00:39:07 You know, I'm just like, like your hero, Shadman,
00:39:09 I'm a disgusting degenerate with a mission
00:39:12 and I'm just sticking to it.
00:39:14 So respect my vision as you respect his.
00:39:18 I'll try.
00:39:19 I'll try.
00:39:20 Do your best.
00:39:22 I'll have to get some lollies in there.
00:39:24 And that's how I'll gain your.
00:39:25 That would help.
00:39:26 That would help.
00:39:27 Yeah. So I'm doing at least,
00:39:29 I think I'm going to try and shoot for three more animations,
00:39:34 short animations this year,
00:39:36 kind of like her that I did the end of last year.
00:39:39 I'm sure you've learned a lot
00:39:40 in the process of making that first one, right?
00:39:41 Hopefully faster.
00:39:42 Yeah, there was, yeah.
00:39:44 The next one I'm doing is a lot simpler.
00:39:46 So I want to get the first one for this year
00:39:49 done by the end of February.
00:39:51 Then the next one will be much more complicated.
00:39:53 And I want to try and end the year
00:39:55 with like a full like music video,
00:39:57 which will be like three minutes long.
00:39:59 And lots of crazy fucking choreography.
00:40:03 So I'm probably going to take an actual
00:40:06 like online course on 3D animation.
00:40:07 Watch out, Monty Ohm.
00:40:09 There's another man looking to fill that grave.
00:40:14 The only way I can live up to him
00:40:16 is to clearly just kill myself,
00:40:17 which might be the plan.
00:40:18 If I don't, if I don't get swole by 30,
00:40:22 I'll just have to like pick out a plot right next to him,
00:40:25 just be like, buddy's in the grave.
00:40:28 But yeah, that's also I'm going to be making
00:40:32 just like more just models in general.
00:40:34 I'll be, I just did my first live stream of the year
00:40:37 yesterday.
00:40:38 I'm going to do one every Friday this year.
00:40:40 That's the plan unless like something really stupid happens.
00:40:44 And just do 3D on stream.
00:40:46 So I'll probably, I'm going to actually make a 3D model
00:40:49 of Foss, the main character of second okay,
00:40:51 that's going to be my next model,
00:40:53 to get them clicks, get them Patreon bucks.
00:40:56 That's the way to do it, that's the way to do it.
00:40:59 But really though, why not?
00:41:00 Why not do the thing that's popular
00:41:02 if you're just going to practice anyway?
00:41:03 It's certainly, yeah.
00:41:04 I mean, that's kind of the idea behind it.
00:41:06 So I'm going to do that.
00:41:08 And then in the background,
00:41:09 I'm just going to keep writing the script for Sorceloss,
00:41:11 which is not dead, it's just,
00:41:13 it went through a huge rewrite all last year
00:41:15 and I finally figured out what to do with it.
00:41:16 Tom, Tom, I gotta say, when I saw that update video,
00:41:19 I forget what it was titled,
00:41:20 but the one that was saying Rebel Pixels is dead.
00:41:22 I thought that it was going to be,
00:41:24 Sorceress lost is dead.
00:41:25 Like that's what I thought you were announcing,
00:41:27 but I'm glad that it wasn't.
00:41:29 Never, it's going to survive for all time.
00:41:31 No, actually the story,
00:41:34 I just had like a huge change of heart
00:41:35 with how I wanted to do it
00:41:36 and it took all year to figure it out.
00:41:37 And I talked to like a couple of my comic friends
00:41:39 going like, what should I do for this?
00:41:41 And then it finally clicked in like November.
00:41:43 I'm like, oh.
00:41:44 Now that's an up and coming female politician
00:41:47 who was going to lose to the evil race realist,
00:41:51 male supremacist.
00:41:52 Now she's going to shatter that glass ceiling.
00:41:54 It has nothing to do with real life events.
00:41:56 Excellent, yeah, I look forward to it.
00:41:58 I was really inspired by what happened.
00:42:01 It let me figure out what's going to happen
00:42:02 in my story.
00:42:07 Like what if someone didn't pay any attention
00:42:09 to US politics, but still read what happened?
00:42:11 Is there anyone who's like done that?
00:42:13 That'd be incredible.
00:42:14 Yeah, me.
00:42:16 Right.
00:42:17 Me and you.
00:42:19 That's true.
00:42:20 So I think that's pretty much it is just.
00:42:24 It's pretty full schedule.
00:42:25 Well, also the whole like moving out thing
00:42:27 I have to move out this year.
00:42:28 So I don't know really what's going to go on to that.
00:42:30 I'm either going to try and get like a small studio apartment
00:42:32 or live in a car.
00:42:34 That'll be fun.
00:42:36 Hey man.
00:42:37 Whichever feels right at the time.
00:42:38 Yeah.
00:42:39 Cincinnati, you get a decent apartment,
00:42:41 you know, okay for 500 bucks a month.
00:42:43 So it's pretty all right.
00:42:45 So that's your horrible.
00:42:46 But then again, if we're going to Boston,
00:42:48 I'm already like right outside of Boston.
00:42:50 So why would I go all the way somewhere else?
00:42:52 Yeah, that's true.
00:42:53 I'm kind of waiting on you and Digi,
00:42:55 what you guys are doing.
00:42:56 And I'll kind of plan appropriately.
00:42:57 He's holding out for a hero, ladies and gentlemen.
00:43:00 We'll see how that goes.
00:43:01 Well, yeah.
00:43:04 Hey man, run your own shit though.
00:43:05 Don't wait too long.
00:43:06 I don't want to fuck over your plans and whatnot.
00:43:08 If there's nothing in place by like April,
00:43:10 that's when I'm really going to start pulling a trigger.
00:43:12 Because I got like $18,000 right now in savings.
00:43:16 Hey, not bad.
00:43:17 I'm just going to try and hit 20.
00:43:19 And then I'm probably just going to like leave my job.
00:43:22 And then because like I'm last.
00:43:24 Yeah, it's fucking awful.
00:43:26 I haven't, I worked six hours this week out of 40
00:43:28 because like there's no heat
00:43:29 and it's been like negative degrees every night.
00:43:32 So I'm just like, well, I don't want to die.
00:43:34 So I'm just not going to go into work, I guess.
00:43:36 So my paycheck is going to be abysmal.
00:43:38 But yeah, once that's done, like my student loans,
00:43:42 I can pay with PCP money and then some.
00:43:44 So that's not a big deal.
00:43:46 I'm glad to hear it.
00:43:48 And if the PCP keeps growing, then I won't need a job.
00:43:51 And then I can just live in a car with.
00:43:54 Oh, good.
00:43:55 The ideal living situation.
00:43:56 It's going to be great.
00:43:59 Dude, there's a.
00:44:00 Vlogs while driving.
00:44:02 I mean, that's a thing people do.
00:44:04 Didn't that guy, who was that guy who announced
00:44:06 that he was going to be homeless and vlog homeless
00:44:08 for like a full year?
00:44:10 It was like one of the big reactor guys on YouTube
00:44:13 who's dead now or something.
00:44:14 Joey salads or something.
00:44:18 I don't know.
00:44:18 It was something like that.
00:44:21 That sounds right to me.
00:44:22 That sounds like that sounds like the name of a person
00:44:24 who would do that.
00:44:27 Good old Joey salads.
00:44:30 That's a real name.
00:44:31 That's a real.
00:44:31 I know it's a real guy.
00:44:32 I don't know God.
00:44:33 I'm taking pot shots at him anyway.
00:44:35 No, Joey salads is a real dude.
00:44:37 He's actually pretty successful.
00:44:38 He's a real person.
00:44:39 Guys, please don't laugh at his.
00:44:42 I can't I can't I can't it's not it's not acceptable.
00:44:48 I agree.
00:44:49 That name is not acceptable.
00:44:50 No, it's pretty pretty bad.
00:44:52 It's pretty bad.
00:44:53 I scoff, frankly.
00:44:57 Well, that's that's going to be fun.
00:44:58 We'll see how that goes.
00:45:00 Hopefully it won't go too bad.
00:45:05 Hopefully, man, hopefully.
00:45:06 Patreon.com slash save me.
00:45:07 Give me money so I can make this stuff happen faster.
00:45:12 Yeah, so I'm going to I'll add a lot of a lot of gold
00:45:18 to give me an Oculus Rift, you know, I'll get an HTC Vive
00:45:21 and then we can have a battle.
00:45:23 Let's start a rivalry going on.
00:45:24 Yeah, I'll have a mansion in VR.
00:45:27 Let me tell you.
00:45:28 Well, just like with D&D, just like me and Tom
00:45:31 will just make opposing YouTube videos.
00:45:34 I'll say why the Oculus Rift is great
00:45:36 and Tom will say why it's shit.
00:45:38 That would legitimately be hilarious.
00:45:40 And I would totally do that.
00:45:41 Looking forward to more of that.
00:45:44 All right, well, Ben, did you want to talk more
00:45:45 about your goals or did you I don't know, you said some stuff
00:45:48 before, but I have I have I have a couple art goals in mind.
00:45:53 I want to.
00:45:54 OK, so I'm working on Vapors 3 right now.
00:45:56 I'm hoping that gets done in not too, too long.
00:45:59 Maybe like, well, I don't want to put a number on it.
00:46:02 But like, yeah, not I'm not like six months or anything.
00:46:07 Yeah, OK, significantly less than that.
00:46:10 After that, I'm not quite sure.
00:46:12 I think I think I'm going to probably do
00:46:14 Champion Chapter 2 after Vapors 3.
00:46:17 Unless maybe I have a great idea for Vapors 4
00:46:20 and I just want to bang out another one real quick.
00:46:23 But I'm also going to do another game.
00:46:25 Like I'm going to I'm going to start Champion Chapter 2
00:46:29 with another like game section.
00:46:31 And I want to do that.
00:46:32 I also want to I want to make a video.
00:46:37 This is not like a big project.
00:46:38 It's just a side thing.
00:46:40 I want to make a video that's just me going through all my code
00:46:43 in Game Maker and just explaining how the first game that I made
00:46:46 works kind of as a kind of just as a little like blog thing.
00:46:50 Like that sounds cool.
00:46:50 I'd like to watch that.
00:46:51 Yeah, yeah, just take a couple hours and like go through it
00:46:54 and be like, this how did I do this?
00:46:56 I forget. Let me.
00:46:57 Oh, yeah, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, a couple hours.
00:47:00 That game takes me like a couple minutes to beat.
00:47:02 That doesn't make sense.
00:47:03 What are you saying?
00:47:04 That's ridiculous.
00:47:05 Yeah. Code is effortless, Ben.
00:47:07 I know, I know, but, you know, I struggle.
00:47:09 I struggle with even the meagerest of tasks.
00:47:16 So, so, so, yeah, I want to make that.
00:47:20 And I'm going to so.
00:47:22 And I don't know what I'm going to work on past Vapors 3
00:47:27 and Champion Chapter 2 and the game, but while I'm doing all that,
00:47:30 I'm probably going to do more kick starters.
00:47:33 Like I'm going to I'm going to kick start Vapors 2
00:47:36 after at some point, maybe I'll wait a little bit and then do that.
00:47:40 I guess if Vapors 3 is done by then,
00:47:42 maybe I'll kick start Vapors 3.
00:47:45 Oh, and I know we joked about it a while ago,
00:47:48 but I'm like, I'm actually unironically
00:47:51 considering making DVDs of the Nuzlocs.
00:47:54 Like I got some DVD software and I'm like,
00:47:56 I've been putting together menus just because I think it's neat.
00:48:01 And because I just I would just want to own one,
00:48:04 even if nobody bought one, I think it's cool.
00:48:07 So, yeah, maybe I want one.
00:48:09 Nobody, none of us have like set anything.
00:48:11 I know the the Pleeve and the Weave plans on being set to disk,
00:48:14 but no one's actually pulled the trigger on that yet.
00:48:16 Yeah, I would like to see that happen.
00:48:17 The thing about that is that looking into it, I am like,
00:48:21 it was really difficult to find like how to like make
00:48:25 like a professionally set up DVD.
00:48:27 And I kind of wonder if anyone else even gave it any thought.
00:48:32 I don't know.
00:48:33 With regards to Pleeve and the Weave.
00:48:35 Like, we all know the level of planning
00:48:37 that went into the Pleeve and the Weave, of course.
00:48:39 So, you know, I'm sure they've got to figure it out.
00:48:41 Like my like my DVDs, they're going to be an experience.
00:48:43 They're going to have menus.
00:48:44 They're they're going to it's going to be like
00:48:46 have like a chapter selection.
00:48:47 It's going to be it's going to be the full work.
00:48:50 You're going to have like a full DVD like experience.
00:48:53 Ben, is it like a like a like a special like Adobe
00:48:57 something or other Adobe fucking show time
00:49:03 when that helps you build DVD menus and things?
00:49:07 I don't know.
00:49:08 I found a DVD architect that I got a free trial of.
00:49:13 Yeah, because because for for my like for my animation stuff,
00:49:18 since it's like, you know, you can submit it online
00:49:22 and most people do or on USB, but they want you as part of the course
00:49:27 to figure out how to make a professional looking DVD
00:49:30 of your animation to hand in.
00:49:32 And if you don't have that, you don't get full marks.
00:49:34 And it's not that difficult.
00:49:37 I don't think I didn't do like special menus.
00:49:39 Help me.
00:49:42 I guess talk details after the show.
00:49:44 No, tell me right now.
00:49:46 Well, it's it's really I mean, I didn't do like a very elaborate menu or anything.
00:49:52 But it's basically you just that there's a software that there are softwares out
00:49:56 and you just you have to render your video files in like a DVD format.
00:50:01 Like HD stuff doesn't work.
00:50:03 It has to be like a deep because like DVDs have a certain amount,
00:50:05 like eight gigabytes of space.
00:50:07 You have to make it the right sort of format so that it could all fit on.
00:50:10 Well, well, you and you and Davoo both said the thing.
00:50:12 You both said there's software out there.
00:50:14 I've been looking for software.
00:50:15 I'm trying to remember that there's an Adobe thing.
00:50:18 There's an it's like it's a blue Adobe.
00:50:20 It's a blue Adobe thing called something something.
00:50:22 Adobe Blu-ray.
00:50:27 Let me let me crack on my keyboard and find it.
00:50:30 All right, Ben, do you know what a light scribe DVD is?
00:50:35 No, you should get a light scribe DVD.
00:50:38 OK, because this is how you make them super cool.
00:50:40 So you get a light scribe DVD burner and what that is, it burns a DVD is normal.
00:50:44 But then the the top of the disc is like, I don't know how it works.
00:50:48 It's like heat sensitive so that you can burn directly a black and white image
00:50:53 to the top of the disc.
00:50:54 You don't put a sticker on there.
00:50:55 It's like burned on top of the discs so you can make them look super professional.
00:50:59 Oh, fuck, yeah.
00:51:00 So I can just burn the image right onto it.
00:51:03 Yeah, you just take you take an image
00:51:05 and it burns a black and white version of the picture right onto the disc.
00:51:08 It doesn't like peel off or anything.
00:51:10 That is the greatest.
00:51:12 So that's what you need.
00:51:14 That is exactly right there.
00:51:16 Yes, yes, yes.
00:51:17 It's it's called Adobe Encore.
00:51:20 Adobe Encore. OK.
00:51:22 Yeah, I don't think they have it on the CC like a creative cloud thing.
00:51:27 But I think that the last one was CS6.
00:51:29 But you know, you can you can acquire that program.
00:51:32 Yeah, I have the means.
00:51:34 I can seize the means of how ominous.
00:51:36 How ominous, yes.
00:51:38 By use license on eBay.
00:51:39 What are you guys talking about?
00:51:41 Yeah, so have we all gone through our plans now?
00:51:45 I feel like we pretty much wound through them.
00:51:47 I was about now.
00:51:48 Yeah, I mean, I sort of yeah.
00:51:50 Yeah, I sort of like skimmed over like specifics
00:51:54 and how I'm going to make videos.
00:51:55 But it's really just it's not much for me to say
00:51:58 other than I'm going to try to do them faster and still be good.
00:52:03 And that's, you know.
00:52:05 Yeah, sure.
00:52:06 I just I mean, since this is the PCP,
00:52:09 I mean, I was I wanted to say that this I think is definitely going to be the year.
00:52:13 Assuming things go as they've been going, where I personally am emancipated at last.
00:52:18 I thought it was going to be the last couple of years.
00:52:20 But now now there is a clear, trackable path of progress
00:52:25 where things are really going well and I could really see how
00:52:29 within the first half of this year, things get to a place where it's,
00:52:34 you know, it'll make sense.
00:52:36 Like I'll be able to finally break out and then consider doing YouTube full time,
00:52:39 which will free me up to explore YouTube possibilities with the PCP.
00:52:44 And then and then we'll just see where that goes.
00:52:46 Well, speaking of that.
00:52:48 Do we have anything to say on the idea of PCP HQ as a plan for 2018?
00:52:54 That's that's what I'm talking about.
00:52:55 Really, when we didn't really talk about PCP goals,
00:52:58 do we have anything we plan on doing with the PCP this year?
00:53:00 Yeah, about the show itself.
00:53:02 I don't know about you guys.
00:53:03 I would like to bring in more guests where possible.
00:53:06 I've got a couple of people kicking around.
00:53:07 We talked about a couple of before the show.
00:53:11 Sure, be nice.
00:53:12 Oh, no.
00:53:13 Oh, yes.
00:53:14 Oh, yes.
00:53:15 No.
00:53:16 Let's just say we're going to take a trip to the dark side.
00:53:18 Everybody.
00:53:19 You know, you don't understand how bad you don't understand how great
00:53:26 an idea I think that is.
00:53:28 It's it's a yeah.
00:53:29 Yeah, I know.
00:53:31 Like why would we not want that?
00:53:35 Well, OK, but we're just I mean, that is one thing I've been thinking about.
00:53:38 And also, like the the PCP episode that came out before this was like a
00:53:42 totally different format, the interviews and stuff.
00:53:44 I want to keep mixing up content like that.
00:53:47 I enjoyed that thought that was fun.
00:53:49 I don't know.
00:53:49 I want to mix things up this year.
00:53:51 And we did it.
00:53:52 We did pretty much the exact same thing the entire year last year.
00:53:56 And there's been some new stuff.
00:53:56 The PCP animated that's like pretty much started this year more or less.
00:54:01 Those are great.
00:54:01 I want to keep doing this in mind.
00:54:03 People keep making them.
00:54:03 You know, that's I think I want to to finally get off my my A.S.
00:54:10 and and and get some PCP races organized and happening.
00:54:16 I did I did write up like a like a guide for how it should be done
00:54:20 so I can refer to it and show people what they have to do.
00:54:23 But the the the PCP races are going to be a little different
00:54:26 if the the the next one we do at least.
00:54:28 Yeah, yeah, where it's it's more about from the beginning.
00:54:34 But like we I'll run through the the basic idea.
00:54:37 People gather to record and then we spin a wheel of what game
00:54:42 they have to get and play and it will be like a free game they can find
00:54:45 or you know something hopefully that they all have or can easily acquire.
00:54:50 And then they from that point have to go and play and speed run the game
00:54:57 on get to whatever point it is and then get the footage back to me
00:55:00 after like a set amount of time from the very beginning of the recording.
00:55:04 And the it's going to be more of like a frantic like oh my God.
00:55:09 I'm downloading the game.
00:55:10 It's taken too long.
00:55:11 And then you got a speed runner and it's going to be very funny.
00:55:14 And yeah, I like it.
00:55:15 And yeah, and then we're going to go when I watch the footage
00:55:18 and it's going to be it's going to be more of a structure that encourages
00:55:22 people to to, you know, try to go really fast
00:55:27 and to be really frantic and unprepared.
00:55:30 And it also means that people don't have any sort of idea of,
00:55:34 you know, getting their time perfect by spent like you, Nate,
00:55:39 playing the thing a hundred times every night to get it.
00:55:44 It's bad. Yeah.
00:55:46 But that's the fun of it.
00:55:48 Well, they just won't get done if they take so much time.
00:55:51 Like the reason the races have never been like it's just hard to get people
00:55:56 to say, OK, I have time to practice this for 20 hours a day.
00:56:02 Like nobody has that time, but they want to have that time.
00:56:05 And it's just never going to happen unless it's more of a speed thing.
00:56:07 We can always choose to do certain races like that if we so choose in the future.
00:56:11 But yeah, if we want to pump them out regularly, something like this,
00:56:15 well, I don't know about regularly, maybe one or two months or something.
00:56:18 But like, yeah, whatever.
00:56:19 Yeah, more than I want that to be a thing that happens.
00:56:25 Because those races were great.
00:56:27 Like the first Dark Souls race was one of the best.
00:56:28 Oh, it's legendary. It's legendary.
00:56:30 Everyone, if you haven't watched it, go watch the PCP Dark Souls race.
00:56:33 It's incredible. I'd say the Pokemon race is equally legendary.
00:56:36 I don't know about that.
00:56:39 So there were some some highlights of that for sure.
00:56:47 Yeah, certainly my favorite.
00:56:50 The draw cast have been going strong.
00:56:51 I've been happy to see that.
00:56:52 Great. And I feel like they're underappreciated.
00:56:55 I feel like they're some of the best content that comes out on this channel.
00:56:59 And I feel like they're underviewed.
00:57:01 No, no, no.
00:57:03 But they're they're way fun.
00:57:05 And they get people and they get people like, you know, drawn along with us
00:57:08 and, you know, people tweet us, you know, like, oh, here's how I did a challenge.
00:57:12 And I love that shit.
00:57:13 You know what we could do?
00:57:14 We could we could combine the idea of having guests and having draw casts.
00:57:18 We could we could maybe get like an art guest to be on a draw cast.
00:57:22 That would be an interesting new thing. Sure. Sure. Yeah.
00:57:26 And you must be, for example.
00:57:28 No, he's banned from the PCP.
00:57:30 There will be no mention of his name, his cursed name.
00:57:33 Picasso, give him an art tab.
00:57:36 We need we need to get Chris Chan in on a draw cast.
00:57:39 Oh, oh, yeah. Imagine.
00:57:41 It's time. Yeah. Yeah.
00:57:44 But the possibilities are end full, but there's a lot of them.
00:57:50 Yeah, man. Yeah.
00:57:51 I don't know. Mix and stuff up.
00:57:53 Try new things.
00:57:53 I'm excited to do more of that in the coming year.
00:57:57 And if you guys have any suggestions, you know, feel free to leave them in the comments.
00:58:00 You know, I'll take them out. I'll check them out.
00:58:03 Yeah, there you go. I don't know.
00:58:05 All right. I feel like we're good.
00:58:07 I feel like we've exhausted everything.
00:58:09 We're fucking done.
00:58:12 Agreed? OK.
00:58:13 I guess. I mean, the only thing left that we didn't really talk about is
00:58:18 PCP HQ and or a new Radcon, but we don't know anything about it.
00:58:22 Yeah, we just want it to happen.
00:58:23 We all still want it still waiting.
00:58:27 I don't know. Like I remember I had said a while ago that we should just set
00:58:30 a date and figure it out, guys.
00:58:33 Just make yourself available for that day tomorrow at one p.m.
00:58:38 I can take off a week from work and like be at a Radcon sometime.
00:58:41 And I just need to know while in advance and I can do it.
00:58:46 Same. I need to know quite a while in advance for plain ticket reasons.
00:58:50 Sure. Sure.
00:58:52 But we got a week that that's on us.
00:58:54 We got to figure that out.
00:58:55 We got to commit to that and make it happen.
00:58:56 Though also the location was always an issue, but.
00:58:59 Right.
00:59:00 Yeah, I don't know.
00:59:01 I mean, you did like a like a mini
00:59:04 Radcon with within the Boston thing.
00:59:06 I don't know whether that's like public knowledge, like secret classified documents.
00:59:10 No, not at all. Yeah, yeah.
00:59:11 Yeah, and Ben and Digi and Munchie and stuff.
00:59:15 You guys were there in person in real life.
00:59:19 It wasn't really a Radcon.
00:59:20 We were just hanging out in the same place.
00:59:22 Well, that's what a Radcon should be.
00:59:24 I just want to hang out for a bit.
00:59:26 I don't. I have no interest in that.
00:59:28 Well, I mean, I do, but I will not go if there's like just hanging out going on.
00:59:31 Just letting you know. Just letting you know.
00:59:33 Well, I know, but like, I understand.
00:59:38 Well, we have to put in some work to like make it happen to arrange where
00:59:41 and how it's going to be. So that's really on us.
00:59:43 I think the biggest, the biggest problem with it so far has just been
00:59:46 that we don't have a place to do it anymore.
00:59:48 That really is.
00:59:49 That was that. Digi's gigantic house was great.
00:59:54 And Victor, as the cameraman, was incredible.
00:59:57 And I'm so sad that we won't have him unless we can convince him there.
01:00:01 Like if we do do a Kickstarter, I'm happy to try to give him some money.
01:00:06 You know, yeah, if we could.
01:00:07 I mean, just just ideas, just ideas.
01:00:10 So now, hey, here's an update, folks.
01:00:13 Now that so much of the plebe and the weave has come out,
01:00:15 would you have any problem with a PCP Kickstarter for, you know,
01:00:19 Radcon Awakening or perhaps we'd probably give it a new name.
01:00:22 So it's no longer at Radcon anymore.
01:00:24 I don't know.
01:00:26 Feel free to leave comments.
01:00:28 I'll read them. I'll check them out.
01:00:30 I'm going to bet.
01:00:31 I mean, I'm imagining that the people who are interested in making that happen
01:00:34 would have been fine with it all along.
01:00:36 Generally speaking.
01:00:38 Probably right.
01:00:39 Well, that's that, Aaron, our dirty laundry in a way.
01:00:43 2018's over.
01:00:45 Go over 2018.
01:00:47 Let's let's indeed let's let's go to those questions, guys.
01:00:51 By the way, before we read a question, I want to read a comment.
01:00:55 So as you know, everybody, hashtag ask PCP on the Twitter is the tag.
01:01:01 We every Saturday we record, we put out a little thing.
01:01:04 Yeah, OK, we got we got a friend here to address our right.
01:01:08 So, you know, I always tweet or we somebody tweets Saturday, you know,
01:01:12 to remind everybody to send in questions.
01:01:13 And so as you've seen, we've taken less questions from there
01:01:17 and more from the patron discord, which, I mean, is just where we want to
01:01:23 incentivize people to be patrons seems reasonable to me.
01:01:26 But a friend of ours here, the one true Henry had a comment about this
01:01:31 that let's just take a moment to address.
01:01:33 Here's here's a response to us asking for questions on Twitter.
01:01:36 Why do you even ask Twitter when you only take one question?
01:01:40 If you just restrict it to Patreon, that will encourage more people to sign up.
01:01:46 You are just giving people a false sense of hope
01:01:49 that their question will be read on the pod case.
01:01:55 Henry, my dude, what the great Henry Yoshi.
01:02:00 Yeah, dog, he's back.
01:02:03 He's back. Listen, dumbass.
01:02:06 You are a silly, silly boy.
01:02:09 Look, look, you just you're just not what is this that we like owe people
01:02:13 to be on the like if we tweet that we will only take, like, you know,
01:02:17 if you watch the show that we take like a pity question.
01:02:19 It's a joke. We address this at the time.
01:02:22 We take like one or two and you're like, oh, you're giving people a false
01:02:25 sense of hope their question will be read.
01:02:27 Well, maybe make it a good question and it'll be the one that we read.
01:02:30 So what exactly is your fucking grievance here?
01:02:33 I don't like this point might be that
01:02:36 people who would want to ask a question instead of just giving us a dollar
01:02:40 or whatever and getting in on it, they're instead just rolling the dice
01:02:44 every week and hoping I think he's just mad that his question has never been asked.
01:02:48 Except for this one, except for this one.
01:02:49 That could be a possibility, which just encourages people to be annoying
01:02:53 and title ourselves because that now we are reading his question.
01:02:56 I am so sorry that we read one question from the Twitter as opposed to zero.
01:03:01 Like you suggest that we do.
01:03:03 I am so sorry that we continue to take questions without putting it behind
01:03:08 any kind of paywall. What a mistake.
01:03:10 What a fuck up on our end. Really got to fix that shit.
01:03:14 I don't know, Nate, you don't seem sorry.
01:03:16 What? How dare you question my integrity?
01:03:20 Henry, I humbly disagree with your point there.
01:03:23 That's all I'm saying.
01:03:24 All right. Real question.
01:03:27 Yes, real questions.
01:03:29 There's this one here.
01:03:31 From the Patreon Discord.
01:03:33 Yeah, yeah, from the Patreon Discord.
01:03:34 Real question time. Yeah, we're away from that bullshit now.
01:03:37 Please, yes, go.
01:03:39 From Great, because we talked about this earlier,
01:03:41 Grace Yu says, how can a plebe, how does can a plebe stay motivated
01:03:47 to go to the gym regularly?
01:03:49 I'm attempting it and want wise words to keep me inspired.
01:03:52 So I'm assuming he had a new use resolution.
01:03:54 Now he's going to the gym.
01:03:56 But how do you do it, Nate?
01:03:58 The problem there is a fundamental question of motivation.
01:04:02 There's a lot of things people do wrong when they're trying to keep themselves
01:04:05 motivated to work out and stuff.
01:04:07 But like it sounds like your core, like your impetus to go
01:04:12 is your fact that you made a resolution.
01:04:15 Well, he didn't say that. I'm just assuming I'm inferring.
01:04:17 I'm inferring here. So I admit, I don't I can't read your mind.
01:04:19 I can't tell everything.
01:04:20 But you're you're you're going because you made a resolution.
01:04:23 And like you definitely want it on some level,
01:04:26 but you don't want it that bad, do you?
01:04:28 You're not willing to sacrifice, you know, the the effort that it takes to go.
01:04:34 Are you? It's really this resolution that's the binding contract,
01:04:37 keeping you going and like just no insult, but that's no basis
01:04:40 to like keep you going long term and stay, you know, exercising and stuff.
01:04:44 You have to the only way to make this work is you have to, I would say,
01:04:48 a, like actually enjoy the process itself of working out.
01:04:53 Like when I work out, it hurts, you know, it's tiring, it's exhausting.
01:04:57 But afterward, just think about that glow you get afterward, how great you feel.
01:05:02 I feel that every time.
01:05:03 That's that that is the specific motivating factor that keeps me going.
01:05:07 And then, of course, in my mind, I have the like long term thoughts
01:05:10 and I guess this will guide me on the physical path, you know,
01:05:13 that I want to get to long term.
01:05:14 So you got to have a short term.
01:05:18 Humans are dumb and we think with our stupid, stupid brains about like the here
01:05:22 and now, and we prioritize that so often over the long term,
01:05:25 you have to know that about yourself and trick your own brain into doing what
01:05:30 you intellectually wanted to do by making yourself focus on the short term benefits
01:05:35 like that, like that pleasurable feeling right after you've worked out
01:05:38 and how good you'll feel knowing you worked out as opposed to how shitty you'll feel
01:05:43 knowing that you were supposed to work out today and you flaked or shit like that.
01:05:46 That's I think that's the long term, more sustainable way.
01:05:49 Also set yourself like reasonable, actionable goals.
01:05:51 But that's that's a whole other story.
01:05:54 Yeah, that's my thoughts.
01:05:56 My thoughts is don't go to the gym.
01:05:59 Just run around, just run around and pick up rocks.
01:06:01 It's the same thing. Yeah, pretty much the same thing.
01:06:05 A good question, everybody.
01:06:08 This is actually from the Twitter from at Lobo.
01:06:11 Oh, no, no, no, no, that guy has deleted the Twitter.
01:06:15 You know what, you're right.
01:06:16 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
01:06:18 Henry has said that we're not allowed to take questions from the Twitter.
01:06:21 So, you know, I don't want to give anybody a false hope.
01:06:23 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
01:06:25 But Henry has forbidden it.
01:06:27 All right, please go on, get what else you got.
01:06:29 You're such a wrathful God.
01:06:32 I know, I know.
01:06:34 I'll go look at some of these.
01:06:36 Here's one.
01:06:37 Tom Sieg asks, which PCP member has the best fan base?
01:06:41 And I got to say, Monkey Jones, obviously.
01:06:45 Yeah, for sure.
01:06:46 For sure. No argument here.
01:06:50 But aside from him, best fan base.
01:06:53 I mean, I would literally argue that it is mine.
01:06:56 I would argue that it is mine.
01:06:59 Because just because they suck your dick.
01:07:01 No, but they it's well, OK, they really do suck my dick.
01:07:04 And I don't actually like necessarily respect them for that.
01:07:08 Because, you know, like they will suck anyone's dick who they like,
01:07:10 you know, like the Jake Paul people suck, you know, whatever.
01:07:13 But it's they seem quite open to the kind of intellectual discussion
01:07:18 that I'm usually talking about.
01:07:20 And I find them to be very reasonable.
01:07:22 And I don't know, maybe this is a projection of my own reasonableness.
01:07:25 Like when people come at me with bullshit on like my Twitter,
01:07:28 I respond just like, I'm like, hey, dude, what's the problem?
01:07:30 I like how you're just saying like, I like how they're they approach me
01:07:33 and they're reasonable and all this shit right after I just shit on a random
01:07:36 Twitter guy for daring to question our decisions.
01:07:40 Well, that's like a PCP guy as opposed to a best guy, I guess.
01:07:44 I don't know. I don't know.
01:07:45 But I mean, he deserves it because he was talking.
01:07:47 Well, you were just saying that like, I like how they kind of like embody
01:07:50 my ideals of like being reasonable and open to discussion.
01:07:53 Don't mind me as I just shit on Henry.
01:07:56 Well, if you'll notice, if you'll notice at the end of my shitting on him,
01:07:59 I ended it with a with my actual point of like, I humbly disagree,
01:08:03 which is honestly how I really feel about it.
01:08:05 So I'm meming, I'm meming a dream and the people understand that, I hope.
01:08:09 I don't know.
01:08:11 Me, I have like an I think because like it's it's it's weird to say
01:08:16 that it's not my own fan base.
01:08:18 I think it's the best fan base, but I obviously do love my fans.
01:08:22 They're cute and they're great and cute and I love them.
01:08:24 I want to give them a big old hug.
01:08:26 But I think Munchies fans, like the people who understand and appreciate
01:08:31 Munchie are probably my favorite people like those people a lot.
01:08:34 Yeah, because they get they get it.
01:08:36 You know, they they're cool. You're right.
01:08:39 I mean, I'm a pretty big fan of my people.
01:08:41 They're all just a bunch of real nice boys.
01:08:44 I've taken notice of the the Ben and Jackie wholesome fan base.
01:08:49 There's just a bunch of just a bunch of swell guys that hang out in our
01:08:52 discord and just are like great, fast friends with each other.
01:08:56 And like, sometimes I get emotional about it.
01:09:00 Lol, I think it's too it's too wholesome for me.
01:09:03 It it it's it's it's making my brain turn it to to to get there's a certain
01:09:10 number of of what is it NPM.
01:09:14 You have to reach a certain ratio of NPM for give to be happy in a community,
01:09:17 which is nine elevens per minute.
01:09:19 There has to be a certain ratio in order for him to feel not even that untrue
01:09:24 because I like I like my edgy boys.
01:09:26 I like people being a raucous and edgy and then also being like real and nice.
01:09:33 All I'm all I'm saying is just yesterday, Alex S.
01:09:36 And paradigm and Phil draw Phil draw just put just they just made a song.
01:09:43 He's made a song about how much they love the discord and how much they
01:09:46 love our streams and I got a little a little choked up.
01:09:51 That's nice.
01:09:51 Yeah, I have a discord as well.
01:09:55 My patron discord and I've had some great talks in there,
01:09:58 specifically with this one guy Denali about like fitness.
01:10:01 He's like he's like he was like a competitive weightlifter or something.
01:10:04 And he was just such a sweetheart who gave me some real great advice
01:10:07 and gave me the info to start the routine that I'm on right now.
01:10:11 So shout out to that guy and just everybody and there's a real nice guy,
01:10:14 especially shout out to me, me, Tian or Midian Mishin in the like a ten dollar
01:10:20 patron in the ten dollar chat where we just talk about one piece all the time.
01:10:23 This person read all of one piece on my suggestion and is now caught up.
01:10:27 And now we're talking about it and it's extremely wholesome and I love it.
01:10:31 Hot shit.
01:10:32 Yeah, I'm a buzzer.
01:10:34 People have like read all of one piece now because yeah, of course,
01:10:37 he's watched every episode of the podcast.
01:10:40 Except crazy, right?
01:10:41 Crazy. It's good stuff.
01:10:44 Oh, yeah, podcast.
01:10:45 Got a patron out of fucking.
01:10:47 I don't want to plug too many extra things.
01:10:49 The podcast pirates, I think that the description is like like bloated
01:10:54 with so many links, nobody's going to click on any of them.
01:10:56 Yeah, it's true.
01:10:57 Except for my Kickstarter.
01:10:58 Give me that Oculus Rift.
01:10:59 It's the last day guys.
01:11:01 It's the last fucking day.
01:11:02 Ten p.m. EST tonight is when it all comes crashing down.
01:11:06 Wow.
01:11:06 That'll be about nine hours from when you hear this or is it ten?
01:11:10 Whatever, something like eight hours.
01:11:12 If you get it right when it comes out, if you're really on top of your shit.
01:11:16 Oh, I was I was including that hour difference if they listen to it
01:11:20 right when it comes out, because it's been an hour.
01:11:21 Oh, oh, oh, oh, right.
01:11:23 Yes, because we're an hour.
01:11:24 That's that's thinking ahead.
01:11:26 That's the best guy ever for you.
01:11:27 He's always 10 steps ahead.
01:11:29 All right, I got one.
01:11:31 We've got one more question here.
01:11:32 Nice, nice light question to end the show.
01:11:35 Hey, he asks, what would you do if your son turned out with heavy autism?
01:11:40 Oh, no, I get my gun.
01:11:45 No. Oh, God, I think this question haunts me literally every day.
01:11:51 I like, am I going to say that I'm going to be like thrilled with the situation?
01:11:55 Well, no one will be not.
01:11:57 Oh, that would.
01:11:58 But it's like also the kind of the most evil thing you can do.
01:12:01 Say like that you don't hear you're not happy with your kid.
01:12:04 Oh, it's fucked up.
01:12:05 Well, I think it's not.
01:12:08 I don't think it's like a bad showing of like a bad person
01:12:12 that you don't like having to deal with a child that is going to be like,
01:12:17 you know, for sure, will be a whole life.
01:12:20 Their whole life. Yeah.
01:12:22 I mean, you know, it's not like autistic people can't work.
01:12:25 They do get jobs and stuff.
01:12:27 But like it's it's more difficult.
01:12:29 It is more difficult as a parent to do that.
01:12:31 I think we just go go grab his son in his arms,
01:12:36 look him straight in the eyes, take him up to the cliff of Sparta
01:12:39 and just cast him off and be like, we're utilitarianism compels me.
01:12:45 I'm trying again with another one.
01:12:47 Oh, it's fucked up.
01:12:49 Yeah, I don't ever worry about this because I'm never going to have a son
01:12:52 or a daughter because it's ridiculous.
01:12:55 Yeah. OK. All right.
01:12:56 Fair understood, understood.
01:12:57 But here's what I would really do is I would really try to analyze
01:13:01 what my kid like check for diseases.
01:13:03 You know, I don't know how much you can predict autism like in the womb.
01:13:06 But seriously, I would if I have a kid that's that's that's brewing in a belly,
01:13:10 I will try to find out every disease so that I can abort it
01:13:14 if things are going wrong and just try again,
01:13:16 because I don't consider it a human being worthy of moral consideration,
01:13:19 not even a little bit until it's like one year old.
01:13:22 So, yeah, that's what I would do.
01:13:26 I mean, I'm not against abortion, but that the idea that you would like,
01:13:30 you know, you would think about that a lot before.
01:13:33 I mean, yeah, of course, what's wrong with that?
01:13:35 I guess. I don't think that's because like you're you're making
01:13:38 a commitment of time and effort when having a child and to be thrown
01:13:42 a curveball like that and expect that like your initial time and investment
01:13:46 and like your commitment that you made is still valid when they're throwing
01:13:50 that huge thing in there. I don't think that's necessarily true.
01:13:53 And I'm taking the steps so that I don't have so that I just like it.
01:13:57 So there is no problem.
01:13:59 I'm addressing it before it becomes a moral question
01:14:02 because an embryo is not a human being.
01:14:04 So there's nothing I don't really see the problem.
01:14:06 Well, it's like, I mean, all right, all right.
01:14:08 Here's my thoughts on the matter.
01:14:09 Like, OK, of course, this is a this is a there's a spectrum here.
01:14:12 The autism spectrum specifically.
01:14:15 Of course, this is a shade of gray.
01:14:17 But like you get you get far enough down on the spectrum.
01:14:20 Like you get to the point where they're like don't even really
01:14:23 like like interact on like a human level anymore.
01:14:26 And like I kind of feel like the closer you get to that spectrum.
01:14:29 But yeah, like like they they they're they become less and less like
01:14:34 worthy of consideration on like a human level.
01:14:37 It's it's just I think that the thing that none of us know for sure
01:14:41 is whether you can tell in the womb quite how autistic a child is going to be.
01:14:46 That's fair. That is fair.
01:14:47 I don't think I don't know if there's any way to test.
01:14:49 Yeah, I don't think you can. Yeah, it's like magically know we could do something.
01:14:52 But I think practically speaking, you're probably I think I think this is why
01:14:55 we need genetic engineering. All right, we can fix.
01:14:57 I agree. I literally have the genome.
01:15:00 We fix all that. Just fix all that in post, you know, just fucking.
01:15:03 Exactly. Yeah.
01:15:07 We need IRL editing tools for human beings.
01:15:10 So that we need we need to invent a robot to do it.
01:15:14 Dude, imagine how sick that's going to be when you just fucking
01:15:17 you do the deed and then you go to the hospital and you just do get the
01:15:20 creator wrestler UI and you can just map it out exactly how you want.
01:15:26 Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.
01:15:28 I want him to have shoulders that are 10 feet tall.
01:15:33 Just like my World of Warcraft characters. Yeah.
01:15:36 Hey, OK, I've got one last question here that is the most important.
01:15:40 And then we can wrap up.
01:15:41 It's chirps case moving castle asks, how does the rest of the PCP work with
01:15:45 the best guy ever without being super jealous for not being the best?
01:15:49 I still have that one question.
01:15:50 That's a very good reason because the best is subjective.
01:15:55 The best is a subjective term and there's nothing that Nate.
01:15:58 There's no work Nate does that I actually want to do to give a serious answer.
01:16:04 Well, hey, that's probably why you don't do it.
01:16:06 You know, we're all free agents out here in the world.
01:16:07 You're doing our own thing.
01:16:08 I'm going to say I'm going to say how does the rest of the PCP work with the best
01:16:11 guy ever? The truth is we don't we don't work.
01:16:16 Oh, which is actually which is actually a compliment to you, Mr.
01:16:21 Nate, best man that you keep the ship running very nicely.
01:16:25 And I'm glad you do.
