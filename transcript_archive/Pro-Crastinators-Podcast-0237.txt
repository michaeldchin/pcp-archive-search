00:00:00 It's extra credits, right?
00:00:08 It's that song, it's the beginning of extra credits.
00:00:11 This is The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:13 Wasn't that just like a Mario song?
00:00:16 Oh yeah.
00:00:17 Wait, it's a remix.
00:00:19 It's a...
00:00:20 When I was...
00:00:23 It's a...
00:00:24 Yeah, I was thinking of, hmm, how does some other show start?
00:00:28 Oh yeah, that one song.
00:00:29 Who are you?
00:00:30 I'm Ben Saint.
00:00:32 The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:35 The show has begun.
00:00:37 I'm Digi and we have special guest, Gamer's Tavern with us.
00:00:41 Gamer's Tavern.
00:00:42 Say what you like about pedophiles.
00:00:44 At least they drive slowly through school zones.
00:00:47 Oh my god.
00:00:50 Oh, that's fucking hilarious.
00:00:53 That's a good one.
00:00:55 Yeah, that's great.
00:00:57 The first time I ever experienced being...
00:01:01 I think I've heard you say that.
00:01:03 I think...
00:01:05 I was in this...
00:01:07 I was writing home...
00:01:09 This guy, a senior at my school who could drive.
00:01:12 When I was a junior, I think, lived in my neighborhood.
00:01:15 It was like, yo, I'll drive you home, dog.
00:01:17 And I was like, sick.
00:01:18 And he fucking...
00:01:19 When you say a senior, do you mean a senior citizen?
00:01:21 No, a student.
00:01:23 A student at my school who was a senior
00:01:25 and showed off how cool he was and had a car
00:01:27 but could not...
00:01:28 Like, obviously too nervous to talk to any girls
00:01:31 except for this one who was secretly a girl
00:01:34 all along a sleeper agent.
00:01:36 But he wouldn't have known that at the time.
00:01:38 So he was driving me home,
00:01:40 listening to Kobe to Cambria,
00:01:41 trying to drive fast through a fucking school zone
00:01:44 and gets pulled over.
00:01:45 And we had to sit there for like half an hour.
00:01:47 And that's when I learned that when you get pulled over,
00:01:49 it takes fucking forever.
00:01:51 Getting all your shit run up.
00:01:53 I've experienced it many times myself
00:01:55 from speeding in the highway.
00:01:57 I think they make you wait on purpose.
00:02:00 I think so too.
00:02:01 I think they deliberately take their time to fuck with you.
00:02:04 I always drive like a couple of miles below the speed limit
00:02:08 because I'm terrified of being pulled over.
00:02:12 Well, you will never get pulled over then.
00:02:15 So you won't have to waste half an hour
00:02:17 and owe the government a bunch of money like I do.
00:02:20 You can get pulled over for driving too slow.
00:02:24 Well, two miles under is not too slow.
00:02:27 Two miles under is not too slow.
00:02:29 Two miles under is not too slow.
00:02:31 They'll think...
00:02:33 Just like five miles over is not too fast.
00:02:36 That's true.
00:02:39 I'm a leadfoot.
00:02:41 I am prone to creeping up
00:02:47 in the speed to be...
00:02:49 Honestly, it's probably a good thing that I don't drive
00:02:52 because I'm not very good at it.
00:02:55 I've gotten really good at driving,
00:02:57 but the better you get at driving,
00:03:00 the more insane your driving feels under observation.
00:03:04 As you get more comfortable with it,
00:03:07 so then you start to be like,
00:03:09 oh, well, I know I can do this.
00:03:11 Then you're like, Jesus Christ, did I just do that?
00:03:14 I'm not very good at it either, but I do it.
00:03:16 That sounds like hubris.
00:03:18 My mom drives like a psycho.
00:03:20 She's never been in an accident.
00:03:22 She's been driving for like 45 years,
00:03:24 and whenever I'm riding with her,
00:03:26 I'm just like, I mean, it feels wrong,
00:03:28 but it looks like a movie.
00:03:31 It looks like baby driver or something, you know?
00:03:34 My dad is a pretty good driver.
00:03:37 He does a thing.
00:03:39 He is pretty annoying because he really likes cars.
00:03:42 He's into them.
00:03:44 So he will flip the clutch
00:03:49 and rotate the shaft
00:03:53 and open all flaps and drag fins
00:03:55 and put the pedal to the metal
00:03:57 and go like...
00:03:59 And it's uncomfortable,
00:04:01 and everyone else in the car is uncomfortable.
00:04:03 Why is this happening?
00:04:05 And my dad is just smugly satisfied.
00:04:08 I have a car that can do this.
00:04:12 It sucks.
00:04:14 You can only drive that fast
00:04:16 if you know what you're doing
00:04:17 and you're really good at it.
00:04:19 That's why I drive kind of slow.
00:04:21 He can parallel park like nobody I've ever been.
00:04:24 I'm assuming this is not the van
00:04:26 that was later purchased by Nate for a dollar.
00:04:29 No, not so much.
00:04:31 That Nate still to this day drives
00:04:33 and has no air conditioning,
00:04:36 no music.
00:04:38 It's funny.
00:04:40 I forget.
00:04:42 The old gold Honda Odyssey.
00:04:44 It's a minivan.
00:04:46 That brings back so many memories.
00:04:49 That was the car of my childhood.
00:04:53 That was the car of Nate's adulthood.
00:04:56 What was this story about again?
00:05:02 Well, it's just a Nate...
00:05:05 My parents had this gold minivan
00:05:09 and like sold it to my brother
00:05:11 when he moved or something.
00:05:13 Or maybe gave it to him, I don't know.
00:05:15 Well, he sold it to him for a dollar.
00:05:17 Your dad sold it to Nate for one dollar.
00:05:19 That's right. He sold it for one dollar.
00:05:21 Bullshit.
00:05:23 Was it literally one dollar?
00:05:25 I don't know. It worked some kind of deal.
00:05:27 Yes, for one dollar.
00:05:29 Well, it's just like Nate didn't want to get it for free.
00:05:31 So he was like, okay, well, then give me a dollar.
00:05:33 So stupid.
00:05:35 That's what happens when you live your life
00:05:38 That does sound like I understand.
00:05:40 I just always picture it as this moment in my mind
00:05:44 where he hands over the dollar
00:05:47 and they're both looking at each other
00:05:49 and that like, ah, you know, like anime,
00:05:52 like dramatic scene, you know, like big panel,
00:05:55 like half page spread both of them
00:05:58 as the dollar goes from one hand to the other.
00:06:01 I learned the word for that thing in anime
00:06:05 where like it frees frames
00:06:07 and it becomes like a painting.
00:06:09 It's called a harmony.
00:06:11 I heard another word for it
00:06:13 that was named after like the guy who invented it,
00:06:15 but I don't remember what the name was.
00:06:17 His name is Shichiro Kobayashi.
00:06:20 No, it started with a U.
00:06:23 I don't know, whatever.
00:06:25 Maybe it was named after the director,
00:06:28 Osamu Dazaki,
00:06:30 because he's like the director who was known for doing it.
00:06:33 I don't know, I saw a tweet.
00:06:36 I know Osamu,
00:06:38 but he's not the one that did 9-11.
00:06:41 Oh my god.
00:06:43 Please, please spare me.
00:06:47 Brett.
00:06:49 Gamers Tavern, you're a fucking cad.
00:06:52 You're a ham.
00:06:54 You ever tell you that?
00:06:56 No, that's the first time I heard that.
00:06:58 Well, it's true.
00:07:02 Oh god, what were you talking about?
00:07:05 The minivan.
00:07:07 Digi was talking about something,
00:07:10 but then you went on a tangent about cars.
00:07:13 We pretty much did the intro
00:07:15 and then like just seven minutes of just it went.
00:07:18 And now we're in heaven.
00:07:20 That's what happened.
00:07:22 Did either of you have a topic
00:07:24 you wanted to bring at the top of the show today?
00:07:26 No.
00:07:28 Well, I kind of wanted to talk about something.
00:07:31 I don't know if you would find it interesting
00:07:34 or your audience would find it interesting,
00:07:37 but wanted to talk about how I came to know the PCP.
00:07:42 Okay.
00:07:44 Yeah, please.
00:07:46 Everyone's got a different story about this.
00:07:49 Well, I'll be interested hearing your side
00:07:52 and I can present my side of it.
00:07:54 Sure.
00:07:55 So who should go first?
00:07:57 I'll say, I think the way that I...
00:08:00 Man, I always forget how I found out about you.
00:08:03 How I found out about you, Gamers Tavern.
00:08:05 Was it Jesse?
00:08:07 I just remembered Jesse.
00:08:09 Or was it someone else?
00:08:10 Yeah, Jesse just stumbled upon the channel
00:08:12 and like posted it and was just like,
00:08:14 this is the funniest thing I've ever seen.
00:08:16 And then Hippo was like,
00:08:18 this is also the funniest thing I've ever seen.
00:08:20 And then they both like contacted him
00:08:22 relatively soon after that, I think, right?
00:08:25 Gamers Tavern, you are...
00:08:28 I'm surprised it wasn't Hippo.
00:08:30 Your stuff seems like so, so much up Hippo's...
00:08:33 I mean, I keep calling you Hippo.
00:08:35 I don't know why I've fallen back to calling Gibb Hippo.
00:08:37 You see so much Gibb's alley.
00:08:40 Yeah.
00:08:41 I always do it too.
00:08:43 I think you have a similar sense of humor.
00:08:46 Sometimes.
00:08:48 Yep, so that's what happened.
00:08:50 I guess it was Jesse.
00:08:51 I think I make the mistake because
00:08:53 I just really loved the Hippo Crit channel.
00:08:56 And like, I always...
00:08:58 I was so insistent on trying to call her Hippo Crit
00:09:01 to promote the Hippo Crit channel.
00:09:04 But now that's dead, so there's no reason to do that anymore.
00:09:07 But it still lives on in my brain.
00:09:09 Well, I...
00:09:11 That's how I originally knew Hippo as Hippo.
00:09:15 But then I found out later that
00:09:18 she goes by Gibbentech, right?
00:09:22 That was the original name.
00:09:24 That was her name as a pony reviewer.
00:09:28 Yeah, I saw some comments on some of my stuff under that name
00:09:32 and it took me a while to realize it was the same person.
00:09:36 And those comments go real far back.
00:09:39 I think they go all the way back to 2013.
00:09:42 So I guess Hippo knew about me for quite a while or given.
00:09:50 I just remember the two, like Jesse and Gibbentech,
00:09:54 talking about your channel all the time
00:09:56 because they would just quote the puns and stuff.
00:10:00 But that's very flattering.
00:10:02 Yeah, it's infectious.
00:10:04 It's infectious.
00:10:05 You start thinking that way after a while.
00:10:09 I try to do a gamer's tavern impression sometimes,
00:10:12 but I'm always embarrassed because I can't do it.
00:10:16 It's the voice.
00:10:18 He's got that thick, full voice that really
00:10:22 draws out the most in the monotone of the joke delivery,
00:10:27 which makes it great.
00:10:29 Well, it's kind of harder to do it live
00:10:32 because I can't cut out any laughter like I can in the videos.
00:10:39 I thought you were going to say silences.
00:10:42 Yeah, I can't do that either.
00:10:45 I love that you literally are laughing at your own puns
00:10:49 as you record those things.
00:10:51 That is really great.
00:10:52 That's funny.
00:10:53 That's a lot actually.
00:10:55 That tends to happen when you try to do comedy.
00:10:59 Sometimes you have the line in your head
00:11:02 and you laugh at it before you say it.
00:11:05 Oh yeah, that's fair.
00:11:07 And it can be difficult sometimes to get through it.
00:11:10 I guess that's why stand-ups have to,
00:11:15 they have to thoroughly practice their set
00:11:18 to make sure that they are over the jokes
00:11:21 before they go on stage.
00:11:24 Do you guys hear that?
00:11:26 Do you keep hearing that beep sound?
00:11:27 A few moments later.
00:11:29 Okay, mystery solved.
00:11:31 That's going to be in the recording?
00:11:34 No, Eleazar, put that in the bonus.
00:11:37 Put this on the bonus episode.
00:11:39 Put it in the secret blooper reel.
00:11:42 Gonna have a pretty big bonus.
00:11:44 But keep me saying, put it in the blooper reel
00:11:47 so that they know that they've got a patreon.com
00:11:52 slash procrastinator.
00:11:54 That's like a bonus in your paycheck, right?
00:11:57 Yeah, actually.
00:11:59 The more we cut, the more we make.
00:12:02 It's one-to-one.
00:12:05 Who's fucking crunching?
00:12:08 Who's fucking crunching?
00:12:12 Who is that?
00:12:14 Who's fucking crunching, dude?
00:12:16 I'm crunching a trisket right now, dude.
00:12:19 I'm crunching so fucking hard.
00:12:22 I'm masticating, dude.
00:12:25 I'm making a fine paste out of the breadstuffs
00:12:28 of this wheat snack.
00:12:32 I had a craving for triscuits yesterday.
00:12:35 It's reduced fat triscuits.
00:12:37 You know why? Because they taste exactly the same.
00:12:40 Yeah, reduced fat.
00:12:42 Reduced fat triscuits.
00:12:44 They already have like four.
00:12:46 They have like two grams of fat in them anyway.
00:12:48 So it's just down to one.
00:12:49 Same shit.
00:12:51 Remember Ben said he wanted to do that once?
00:12:54 Who did?
00:12:55 You did.
00:12:57 He said he wanted to crunch.
00:12:59 To reduce fat?
00:13:01 No, you wanted to open an episode by crunching.
00:13:06 We had a whole bonus episode that was nothing but crunching.
00:13:09 Oh, what a nightmare.
00:13:11 Were you on that one?
00:13:12 No, I would have probably killed myself if I had been.
00:13:15 It was the whole gimmick.
00:13:17 I think we went for like an hour and it was just,
00:13:19 you couldn't talk unless you had food.
00:13:25 It was so bad.
00:13:26 It sounds like a good time.
00:13:28 All of our episodes are like that.
00:13:30 All of our bonus episodes are a fucking blur.
00:13:33 Do you know about them?
00:13:35 Do you know the latest one we did?
00:13:37 And I'll tell you this, not to advertise it,
00:13:40 but because I think you would find it funny.
00:13:42 Our last bonus episode was a commentary track for our first episode,
00:13:49 where it's us like listening to the first episode
00:13:54 and commentating on it as we go.
00:13:56 And you're supposed to play it and the first PCP episode at the same time.
00:14:01 So you have them synced up and you can hear our live reaction to it as it goes.
00:14:06 I think I saw you tweet that, but I wasn't sure what you were commentating.
00:14:10 Maybe I did.
00:14:11 I saw it that it was a commentary track.
00:14:16 We actually have to do another one of those.
00:14:18 Yeah, I was just thinking like, is that the most recent one?
00:14:21 That felt like it was a while ago.
00:14:23 No, we recorded that just over a month ago.
00:14:27 So we just have to do another one before the end of this month.
00:14:29 It's just that I went across America and back in that time,
00:14:33 so it feels like a long time passed.
00:14:35 Have you talked about that on the show?
00:14:37 I have not really talked about it on the PCP, no.
00:14:40 You want to talk about your fucking cross-country trip?
00:14:43 Yeah, I'm editing the documentary of it right now,
00:14:46 and it'll probably be out probably before this.
00:14:50 But I'll advertise it and explain it,
00:14:56 because it's a very gonzo documentary.
00:15:00 Basically, the three people who have come to live in my house,
00:15:08 named Ari, Riley, and Mint,
00:15:12 basically we were initially all just going to do a tour similar to this one.
00:15:18 Crack in a gridlock.
00:15:20 Crack in a summit gridlock for this one.
00:15:23 Basically, these three people came to stay at my house temporarily
00:15:27 with the ambition of all of us doing a tour together.
00:15:30 And then after my previous relationship ended,
00:15:34 I basically was like, hey, you guys just stay here
00:15:38 and we'll do stuff together until we can do tours,
00:15:42 and just get a fucking...
00:15:44 until we can afford to get an RV or something
00:15:47 and go on adventures all the time.
00:15:50 There was already a plan for this festival
00:15:56 that Dick Masterson of The Dick Show was...
00:15:58 He wanted to do his own version of Burning Man,
00:16:01 which got canceled this year because of COVID,
00:16:03 called Burning Dick, out in the middle of the desert in a dry lake bed.
00:16:08 Across the lake bed from a rave, we had our own...
00:16:12 It was not a...
00:16:14 Wait, like a different rave?
00:16:16 Yeah, there was just a rave going on on the other side of the lake bed,
00:16:19 but we were...
00:16:22 I don't even think it ended up happening
00:16:24 because everything got dusted out.
00:16:26 When we went to this thing, it pretty much lasted a day.
00:16:30 And then the next day, there was so much dusted,
00:16:33 everybody's tents was getting destroyed,
00:16:35 so everybody packed it up and left.
00:16:37 My party had left early anyways
00:16:41 because we were just on a fucking manic adventure
00:16:44 and lots of drugs.
00:16:47 Our Gonzo adventure took us from Virginia
00:16:53 down through Arkansas, which is where Riley's from,
00:16:57 to stay with his grandma.
00:16:59 And then we went to Dallas
00:17:02 and hung out with a mysterious organization known as The Bucket,
00:17:06 which...
00:17:07 Whoa, okay, tell me about that.
00:17:09 I can't tell you much about The Bucket.
00:17:12 You can tell me a little bit.
00:17:14 All right.
00:17:15 Well, The Bucket is some really cool people,
00:17:18 really nice, really helpful,
00:17:20 supplied us with a lot of drugs.
00:17:23 And so...
00:17:24 Okay.
00:17:25 We...
00:17:26 They're unironically extremely cool people,
00:17:28 but some of the nicest drug people I've ever met in my entire life...
00:17:34 Are they like...
00:17:35 Okay, are they like...
00:17:36 Are they gonna have a bucket list?
00:17:37 Like, imagine if Robin Hood gave you drugs.
00:17:40 Are they a cult?
00:17:43 I mean, they can be, I guess.
00:17:46 I don't think so.
00:17:47 I don't know.
00:17:48 All right.
00:17:49 No, I'm gonna go with them.
00:17:50 I was hoping they were.
00:17:51 Damn, okay, fuck.
00:17:52 But The Bucket can be whatever you want it to be, I guess.
00:17:57 So they try to have plenty of fun before they kick The Bucket, right?
00:18:01 Exactly.
00:18:02 Well, they're aiming to get...
00:18:04 That's a good way of putting it, yeah.
00:18:06 They're aiming to kick The Bucket.
00:18:08 They're aiming for that.
00:18:09 Aiming to kick The Bucket in the most fun way possible.
00:18:12 Let's put it that way.
00:18:13 Right on.
00:18:14 So we hung around The Bucket for a couple days,
00:18:18 and then we got some footage of Riley walking around with a cape
00:18:23 being the super spreader in Dallas.
00:18:29 Yeah.
00:18:30 So we then went to California into the desert,
00:18:34 hung out with Dick Masterson and a bunch of guys who had a lot of guns,
00:18:38 and we shot a lot of guns at a mountain.
00:18:40 I saw you shooting guns on Twitter.
00:18:44 Yeah, I was guided into the guns.
00:18:47 That was scary.
00:18:49 I am afraid of weapons.
00:18:51 The bigger guns are so fucking heavy, I could not...
00:18:55 I basically fired two or three times and was like,
00:18:57 I can't even hold this thing anymore.
00:18:59 It's fucking killing my arms.
00:19:00 If anyone comes at you with a gun, you need to gun it.
00:19:03 That's true.
00:19:04 I've fired a gun one time.
00:19:07 I think I fired at a pistol range with the Boy Scouts or whatever.
00:19:11 I think depending on how far away the person is in most circumstances,
00:19:16 gunning it's probably a better response than trying to return fire.
00:19:21 You got a better chance of getting away.
00:19:24 You got to be...
00:19:26 It's about the spacing.
00:19:28 Make sure you juke.
00:19:29 It's about the spacing, right?
00:19:31 If you're within five feet, the bad guy will get you before you pull the gun.
00:19:36 But if you're like 15, it's like 50-50, and if 30, it's like...
00:19:40 If you're five feet, you got to go straight for the nads with your leg.
00:19:44 Just kick to the balls.
00:19:46 Bam.
00:19:47 Easy.
00:19:48 No thought.
00:19:50 Pure instinct.
00:19:51 Yeah, exactly.
00:19:53 So we shot some guns in the desert and then we pretty much were like,
00:19:57 all right, well that's all we came here to do really.
00:19:59 So then we went to Vegas for a stop.
00:20:04 Vegas sucks.
00:20:06 Riley loves Vegas because he's like,
00:20:09 oh, this is the last best deal of America or whatever.
00:20:14 That sucks so bad.
00:20:15 Everything's overpriced.
00:20:17 I mean, it's just that everything is a trap there.
00:20:20 Yeah, exactly.
00:20:21 It all starts cheap and then quickly, steeply escalates,
00:20:25 and it's all built around trying to trap you in that.
00:20:27 Vegas is cool to walk through.
00:20:30 Don't go any building.
00:20:31 That's really all we did because we basically just dropped acid
00:20:34 and walked around on Fremont Street,
00:20:36 which was, it was just like too overwhelming for me.
00:20:40 Is that the one with all the lights over it?
00:20:43 Yeah, the big sky thing.
00:20:46 And yeah, I got too spooked too quick.
00:20:49 We basically just wandered around for a couple hours
00:20:51 and went back to the hotel room, then did Molly,
00:20:54 and that cured my anxiety for like two days.
00:20:57 That was pretty cool.
00:21:00 Did I tell you about the time I did Molly?
00:21:02 No, you did not.
00:21:04 I talked about it on here, but I'll say it again.
00:21:07 Someone just offered it to me, and I was kind of drunk,
00:21:10 and I was like, yeah, sure, whatever.
00:21:11 Yeah, fuck it.
00:21:12 I don't know what this is.
00:21:13 Great mentality.
00:21:16 What ended up happening was...
00:21:21 No, no, it was funny.
00:21:22 The guy gave it to me.
00:21:24 I think he gave me like a half-tablet because he was like,
00:21:26 I was like, yeah, I've never taken Molly before,
00:21:28 and he was like, I'll just give you a half-tablet then.
00:21:29 And I was like, cool.
00:21:30 And one of the other guys, he made like a joke about like
00:21:33 how it can kill you or something,
00:21:35 and the guy who gave it to me got real serious with that guy.
00:21:38 He like scolded him.
00:21:39 He was like, dude, no.
00:21:40 Dude, do not tell a guy that.
00:21:42 He's getting high right now, and if you tell that,
00:21:44 it's gonna suck for him.
00:21:46 He was like real serious about like,
00:21:48 do not give this guy a bad time on my drugs,
00:21:50 which I respected.
00:21:52 I appreciated it.
00:21:54 But all that happened was I walked home,
00:21:58 like babbling to my friend about some shit I don't remember.
00:22:02 And then when I got home, I thought like,
00:22:05 man, people don't connect anymore.
00:22:09 People don't love each other enough.
00:22:10 Molly is a very emotionally open drug.
00:22:13 So I walked to my neighbor's house at like four in the morning
00:22:15 and started knocking on the door,
00:22:17 because I was like, I want to say hi.
00:22:18 I want to make friends with these people.
00:22:19 Oh yeah, that's right.
00:22:20 You did tell me about that.
00:22:22 I think I remember hearing this.
00:22:23 And then the next day they came over and they were like,
00:22:25 someone was knocking on our door.
00:22:27 Now that I've done the drug,
00:22:28 I understand how that happened.
00:22:30 I totally get it now.
00:22:31 Yeah.
00:22:32 Yeah.
00:22:33 It's a very...
00:22:34 I don't remember where you told this story,
00:22:36 but I have heard it.
00:22:38 I must have listened to some previous episode, I guess.
00:22:43 It was of all the bad things that could happen
00:22:45 when you take a drug that was pretty mild,
00:22:47 and I think it's funny.
00:22:49 Yeah, it is pretty funny.
00:22:51 So anyway.
00:22:53 So we went through Vegas,
00:22:55 and then from there we went to Idaho
00:22:58 because they had all come to my house from Twin Falls, Idaho,
00:23:03 from a different house they had been staying in,
00:23:06 and all their stuff was there.
00:23:08 But because we already had a lot of stuff with us for the trip,
00:23:11 we were not able to take that much of their stuff back,
00:23:13 which was pretty tragic.
00:23:15 But pretty much from there,
00:23:18 we just made a straight beam from...
00:23:21 We slept the night in Kansas,
00:23:24 stayed in Arkansas for another night,
00:23:28 and then went back up to Virginia.
00:23:32 So it was like pretty breakneck.
00:23:34 It was like two weeks of mostly nonstop driving
00:23:38 literally across the entire fucking country
00:23:41 in all directions.
00:23:43 I saw every biome of America.
00:23:46 It was pretty entertaining, honestly,
00:23:48 even just being in the car,
00:23:49 and just looking at how different...
00:23:52 That sounds fun.
00:23:54 The desert, very different vibe from the east coast,
00:23:58 very different vibe from the north part.
00:24:01 I won't say that it wouldn't get old
00:24:03 if you took the same routes over and over again,
00:24:06 but I do think taking different routes
00:24:09 for a while would be interesting.
00:24:11 I think people would be shocked
00:24:14 at how close you can probably get
00:24:16 to literally seeing all of America.
00:24:20 You say all of America,
00:24:22 but America is a huge place.
00:24:24 It's fucking unbelievably massive,
00:24:26 but so much of it you can see...
00:24:29 When you're in Nevada,
00:24:32 you see for fucking miles in all directions.
00:24:35 It's extremely open.
00:24:38 It's mostly fucking desert.
00:24:42 A long time ago, I went to Vegas,
00:24:45 and I didn't like it much,
00:24:48 but the one thing I really disliked about it
00:24:51 that kind of depressed me is that
00:24:53 whenever I would wake up in the morning
00:24:55 and looked out of the window of my hotel,
00:24:57 all I see around me is desert.
00:25:00 You can see where the city ends
00:25:02 and the desert begins,
00:25:04 and you're basically in a city
00:25:07 in the middle of a giant desert.
00:25:10 It kind of felt bleak.
00:25:13 I had the best Korean barbecue
00:25:16 of my life in Vegas,
00:25:19 so it's got that going for it.
00:25:21 Wish I had gone to Korean barbecue.
00:25:23 We went to a place called the Heart Attack Grill,
00:25:26 where they have...
00:25:29 They will give you up to a 10-patty,
00:25:32 giant fucking burger
00:25:34 that's literally designed to kill you.
00:25:37 There have been two deaths at this restaurant,
00:25:40 and if you are over 350 pounds,
00:25:42 they will give you your food for free.
00:25:45 You have to get up on a big scale
00:25:48 in front of everybody and be weighed.
00:25:51 What I did not understand about this place,
00:25:54 from the outside, it's like,
00:25:57 big food, Heart Attack, whatever.
00:26:00 When you get inside,
00:26:02 first of all, all the waitresses are dressed as nurses.
00:26:05 Everything is themed around a hospital,
00:26:08 and it's all shame play.
00:26:10 If you finish your food,
00:26:12 then they spank you in front of everyone,
00:26:14 like with a paddle.
00:26:16 The whole place is some weird fetish thing.
00:26:19 It was bizarre.
00:26:21 Based.
00:26:23 I was not into it.
00:26:25 I was like, okay.
00:26:27 It was fun to experience for one time,
00:26:30 but I was like...
00:26:32 If they advertise that they want you to die,
00:26:34 and you die, can't you sue them?
00:26:37 No, you literally are signing your life away.
00:26:40 They did not make a sign of waiver,
00:26:42 but I think it says on the door,
00:26:44 if you step into this restaurant,
00:26:46 you understand that...
00:26:48 I don't know how legally binding it is.
00:26:50 I don't want people to die in my name,
00:26:52 and then sue me after they're dead.
00:26:54 There literally have been multiple deaths.
00:26:57 I would assume the family could sue
00:26:59 after somebody dies there.
00:27:01 Remember Dick's last resort?
00:27:04 Do you eat there with us at Christmas the other day?
00:27:07 A couple years ago?
00:27:09 Yeah, the dirty dicks.
00:27:11 The place where they insult you?
00:27:14 Yeah, they make fun of you the whole time.
00:27:16 That place is comparably more innocent
00:27:19 in vibe compared to this one.
00:27:22 I was not impressed.
00:27:24 They didn't hurt my feelings even a little bit,
00:27:26 to be perfectly honest.
00:27:28 They took it easy on me.
00:27:30 That reminds me of, I think,
00:27:32 a sketch that I think the widest kids did.
00:27:36 I think it was them.
00:27:38 It was a restaurant, and they would insult you.
00:27:41 It was a real restaurant.
00:27:44 I actually didn't know that was a real restaurant.
00:27:46 I thought that was just a skit.
00:27:48 It's called Dick's Last Resort.
00:27:50 I think it's a chain, but the one that I know
00:27:52 is at Faniel Hall in Boston.
00:27:54 Oh, I haven't seen the skit, though.
00:27:57 I love the widest kids you know.
00:27:59 I used to like the widest kids you know.
00:28:01 I don't know if I would still like them.
00:28:03 I'm a pretty big fan of them myself.
00:28:06 I'm sure.
00:28:08 Do they still exist?
00:28:10 Do they still do stuff?
00:28:11 Yeah.
00:28:12 I know they did something or other recently.
00:28:15 I don't know what it is.
00:28:17 They still exist, but I don't think they do the skits anymore.
00:28:19 No, they don't do that show.
00:28:22 A big part of why I campaigned so hard
00:28:28 for this show to be called the PCP
00:28:30 was because of the gallon of PCP sketch
00:28:32 from the widest kids.
00:28:33 Yeah, I remember that sketch.
00:28:34 It's one of my favorites.
00:28:36 Oh, yeah.
00:28:38 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:28:40 I forgot about that.
00:28:42 I forgot about that.
00:28:46 Go on.
00:28:47 Go on, please.
00:28:48 No, you.
00:28:49 No, no, no, by all means you insist.
00:28:52 I insist.
00:28:53 Oh, but no, no, I'm not sipping.
00:28:55 I wasn't done sipping my red stripe
00:28:58 at, you know, I'm not done.
00:29:01 Well, I'm not done with my summit gridlock.
00:29:04 You know, it's funny.
00:29:06 I think most people would be surprised to know that I'm a big
00:29:10 fan of edgy humor, you know, widest kids, you know, and stuff
00:29:14 like that.
00:29:15 Yeah, I would be shocked to find out that you
00:29:19 opened the open the show with a pedophile.
00:29:22 Yeah.
00:29:24 Um, I think I like to.
00:29:29 Sorry, I went to the stream, the election stream that
00:29:33 Ben did.
00:29:34 That's right.
00:29:35 You were in there and towards the election night.
00:29:38 It was around towards the end, I think.
00:29:40 And you mentioned something strange, at least strange to me.
00:29:44 I told, yes.
00:29:46 I told I told an anecdote.
00:29:49 Hey, you told me somebody told you that the PCP ruined the
00:29:54 gamers tavern brand by making it more edgy.
00:29:58 Yeah, that's true.
00:30:00 Somebody somebody did tell me that.
00:30:02 That's not that.
00:30:03 I've watched the old gamers like the oldest gamers taverns
00:30:06 videos.
00:30:07 I remember them all having edgy jokes in them like you
00:30:10 would bounce between like these really wholesome jokes and
00:30:13 then these really edgy jokes sometimes like.
00:30:16 Yeah.
00:30:18 Yeah.
00:30:19 I think I think you're right.
00:30:21 This was not, I mean, this was not.
00:30:24 Yeah.
00:30:25 Somebody told me and the reason I remembered it because I was
00:30:27 I was kind of like, wait, what?
00:30:29 I don't know.
00:30:30 I didn't agree with it, but I thought it was, I thought it was
00:30:34 pretty wild actually.
00:30:35 I thought it was funny because it's like somebody came up with
00:30:39 a narrative in their head and running with it.
00:30:43 So, I mean, it's not true, but it's funny.
00:30:46 It's cool that it was true actually because it's more
00:30:48 interesting than the truth.
00:30:51 I would like to say that I ruined the gamers.
00:31:01 But I don't think I can.
00:31:03 I don't think I can claim that in good conscience.
00:31:05 Unfortunately.
00:31:06 Hey Ben.
00:31:07 It's kind of a dramatic.
00:31:09 Yeah.
00:31:10 I mean, there's not much of a brand to ruin.
00:31:15 I think everybody go fucking subscribe.
00:31:17 I immediately recognize the brown and brown of the gamers
00:31:21 Tavern logo.
00:31:23 So I would say the brand is strong.
00:31:25 I can't.
00:31:26 I will say though, at least based on your discord avatar,
00:31:29 I cannot actually read the text on it.
00:31:32 Yeah, I just, I just noticed that.
00:31:36 You know, I do everything myself.
00:31:38 So I don't have any graphic designers or artists.
00:31:43 So I'm not exactly very good at that kind of thing.
00:31:46 I'm sure we can get you a hookup because there happens
00:31:50 to be fuckloads of artists in this community and podcast.
00:31:55 So if you are interested in having new artwork,
00:31:58 just let us know.
00:32:00 I got it.
00:32:01 Okay.
00:32:02 It's pretty unfortunate.
00:32:04 I tried to, I tried to, I'm not logged into my YouTube.
00:32:08 So I tried to get to your show and I Google,
00:32:11 Gamers Tavern two words and there's a different channel
00:32:15 called Gamers Tavern.
00:32:17 So then I was like, oh, no, no, it's all one word.
00:32:19 So then I searched it with, without the space.
00:32:22 And then two came up.
00:32:24 There's the Gamers Tavern, which is a different, different show.
00:32:28 And then there's yours, which is Gamers Tavern show.
00:32:30 There's a lot of Gamers Tavern out there.
00:32:33 Mine is Gamers Tavern show.
00:32:36 Gamers Tavern show.
00:32:37 I came up with Gamers Tavern back in 2003.
00:32:41 It was a website, right?
00:32:43 Before it was a YouTube.
00:32:44 Yeah.
00:32:45 The website is GamersTavern.com.
00:32:47 Yeah.
00:32:48 And back then there was only one other person using Gamers Tavern,
00:32:52 but now there's like 10 or 15 or 20.
00:32:55 And for some reason, all the other Gamers Taverns that exist now
00:33:00 are way more popular than I am, even though I'm the original.
00:33:05 I mean, I think there's probably, it makes sense to me.
00:33:11 It feels natural because I think there's a pretty natural
00:33:17 and broad cross-section of like, you know, aging people
00:33:22 like my age, your age, who are like late millennials
00:33:28 who are reaching the age where they're starting to like craft beer.
00:33:33 He said he started using the name in 2003.
00:33:36 Oh yeah, but he said he's proliferating now.
00:33:39 I don't know, I just, the appeals, there's a certain brand,
00:33:42 there's a certain brand of nerd, right, who's like into craft beer,
00:33:46 and they're basically just Tycho from Penny Arcade is what I'm saying.
00:33:52 I was a big Penny Arcade fan back then.
00:33:54 That kind of name would appeal to, I think.
00:33:56 It appeals to me.
00:33:57 I inherently hear Tavern, I think.
00:34:00 The ironic thing is...
00:34:02 Yeah, exactly.
00:34:03 I'm saying it's an appealing aesthetic.
00:34:05 Like, what about just a Tavern, but for gamers?
00:34:09 Yeah, it was an aesthetic choice, but ironically, I don't drink.
00:34:15 Is that true?
00:34:17 Yeah.
00:34:18 You're the only one not drinking right now, I think, on the show, right?
00:34:22 Ben?
00:34:23 Well, I'm drinking, I'm getting high on caffeine and taurine
00:34:28 and branch chain amino acids.
00:34:31 I was hoping you were drinking, because I was thinking that if we were both...
00:34:35 No, not right now.
00:34:36 If we were both day drinking and being incessantly catty,
00:34:41 this show would just be the new Kathy Lee and Hoda.
00:34:44 Have you ever watched Kathy Lee and Hoda on the Today Show?
00:34:48 Are you familiar with this?
00:34:49 No.
00:34:50 God, no.
00:34:51 I don't know why.
00:34:52 I feel like I'm the only person in my entire generation
00:34:56 or something who's actually seen this show.
00:34:58 Maybe I'm just...
00:34:59 Well...
00:35:00 I mean, I know of the Today Show.
00:35:02 There's like an hour of every morning.
00:35:04 I mean, they don't do it anymore, I think.
00:35:06 But it was Kathy Lee, Gifford, and Hoda Catby.
00:35:10 These two ladies in their late 40s.
00:35:13 Hoda Catby?
00:35:14 Catby.
00:35:15 And they would just sit in chairs and get drunk
00:35:19 and talk over each other for an hour.
00:35:21 And sometimes it would just like...
00:35:24 If I passed out on the couch, I'd wake up and this show would be on.
00:35:28 Oh, God, she looks like a bronze Nancy Pelosi.
00:35:31 Sounds like top quality entertainment.
00:35:35 I enjoyed it.
00:35:37 I mean, it's definitely a show that most of the people
00:35:43 who I've ever known would not watch, but I enjoyed it.
00:35:47 Is this a new discovery?
00:35:52 No, I used to...
00:35:53 The show's not even on anymore.
00:35:55 It's just like I would wake up in the middle of the day
00:35:58 and be like, oh, Kathy Lee and Hoda.
00:36:00 It's like having a couple funny aunts who just...
00:36:03 A couple of funny wine aunts just babbling about nothing.
00:36:07 The show would be literally incoherent sometimes.
00:36:10 The level of just talking over each other and being drunk
00:36:14 couldn't even tell what the fuck they were saying.
00:36:16 And I was just like, this is better than regular television for me.
00:36:19 I don't particularly care to hear what anybody is saying.
00:36:23 This is much funnier.
00:36:25 You should have started a YouTube channel analyzing Kathy Lee and Hoda.
00:36:30 That's a good idea.
00:36:31 I don't think anybody on YouTube has ever seen it.
00:36:33 You should have started with that.
00:36:35 I've never brought this show up to anyone I've known
00:36:38 and them have any idea what I'm talking about,
00:36:40 even though it's like a show that I assume is watched by millions of people every day.
00:36:43 It's part of the today's show.
00:36:45 That doesn't sound like a TV show.
00:36:48 It sounds more like something you'd see on YouTube.
00:36:51 It was basically a podcast.
00:36:54 They literally just sat in elevated chairs at a bar table,
00:37:00 a little round table with drinks at 10 in the morning
00:37:05 and just obviously already have been drinking before the show
00:37:11 and continue drinking through the show,
00:37:13 sometimes getting just utterly plastered
00:37:15 and just having guests on who are like, I don't know,
00:37:19 celebrities from whatever show,
00:37:21 they just flirt with them and then fucking talk over them.
00:37:24 That's it.
00:37:25 It's a bit early to start drinking.
00:37:28 That's what's so great about it.
00:37:30 It's 4.18 right now, almost 4.20.
00:37:34 It doesn't seem early for me to be drinking,
00:37:36 but I only woke up like three hours ago,
00:37:38 so it is early for me to be drinking.
00:37:41 I am not drinking now,
00:37:43 but I have been drinking a lot more lately during COVID times.
00:37:50 I've been drinking a lot of sparkling wine.
00:37:54 I don't know why,
00:37:56 but I've started my routine on a day that I decided to say fuck it
00:38:00 as I go down to my local spirit shop
00:38:04 and I buy the two cheapest bottles
00:38:07 of barefoot bubbly, brute cuvée that I can find.
00:38:12 See now, this definitely sounds like something
00:38:14 that they would be drinking on Kathie Lee at home.
00:38:17 Yeah, it does, now that you mention it.
00:38:20 I'm drinking Red Stripe, which is not the most daytime TV.
00:38:26 I can't see Kathie Lee down here on Red Stripe.
00:38:30 Isn't it Red Stripe?
00:38:32 Did they have the ads with like that Jamaican guy?
00:38:35 The Jamaican beer.
00:38:37 Yeah, okay.
00:38:39 Jamaican me crazy, man.
00:38:42 And I'll just do two bottles in a day.
00:38:45 Two bottles in a day is enough that I'm pretty blasted
00:38:50 and don't remember going to sleep.
00:38:53 And that's what it's like.
00:38:55 I'm curious about this Ben,
00:38:57 because you are somebody who gets blackout drunk.
00:39:00 Sometimes.
00:39:02 Enough times.
00:39:04 More than once a year, we'll say.
00:39:06 Oh.
00:39:08 Oh yeah.
00:39:11 Not even close, yeah.
00:39:13 More than once a month?
00:39:16 Probably not that much though.
00:39:18 Okay, okay.
00:39:19 So like 10 times a year.
00:39:20 Maybe once a month.
00:39:22 10 to 15, all right.
00:39:24 5 to 10.
00:39:26 I've only ever been blackout drunk one time
00:39:30 on my 21st birthday.
00:39:32 And like just like having it had happened
00:39:36 was so terrifying to me
00:39:38 that I've never been willing to let it happen again.
00:39:41 Why?
00:39:42 Was it scary to wake up and be like,
00:39:44 I don't remember what happened?
00:39:46 Yeah, I get that.
00:39:48 Just to have realized that like my fate
00:39:50 was completely in the hands of the people around me
00:39:53 and that they were like fairly non-committal
00:39:56 and taking care of me.
00:39:58 You know what I mean?
00:40:00 It was like, even though it was my mom,
00:40:03 her friend Victor and our friend Marcus,
00:40:07 and like Marcus is just like,
00:40:09 I don't want to be the one who gets stuck
00:40:11 getting cried on tonight.
00:40:13 Victor is just like,
00:40:15 oh, this is annoying
00:40:16 and I want nothing to do with any of it.
00:40:18 And my mom and her friend are getting high
00:40:20 and they're drunk as shit and they don't care.
00:40:22 So you know, and Marcus is like showing me footage
00:40:25 on his phone of me like crying and stuff
00:40:27 and my mom's telling me like,
00:40:28 oh yeah, we were talking about like buying you a hooker and shit.
00:40:31 And I was like, I'm going to go like never do this again.
00:40:35 It's fucked up, man.
00:40:36 It's fucked up.
00:40:38 I'm like, you know, I mean, it is scary.
00:40:41 When I wake up, when I wake up and I'm like,
00:40:43 I don't remember what happened.
00:40:44 Yes, it's scary.
00:40:45 It's terrifying.
00:40:47 It's the nightmare.
00:40:48 I hate it.
00:40:49 Yeah.
00:40:50 But you know, the night before,
00:40:52 you know, I'm like, you know,
00:40:54 if I drink slowly enough,
00:40:55 if I drink slowly, you know,
00:40:57 it's not like I can,
00:40:58 it's not like I can feel the transition
00:41:00 from normal to blackout.
00:41:02 It feels like a smooth transition
00:41:04 and I feel normal at the time.
00:41:06 Have you had any like,
00:41:08 a cliff night wake-ups yet?
00:41:12 Cliff night wake-ups.
00:41:13 Yeah, like the video,
00:41:14 cliff night, like where he's waking up.
00:41:17 Oh, like when he wakes up next to that hell cat and angel
00:41:20 or maybe a demon wearing a human suit.
00:41:23 Just as outrageous as what transpires therein.
00:41:28 I had a night.
00:41:30 This was like years ago,
00:41:31 but I do remember I went to some party
00:41:34 and some guy had like,
00:41:36 some fucking guy in a tweed suit or whatever,
00:41:39 had like some whiskey that he said was like,
00:41:41 oh, this is like such value.
00:41:43 This is like, oh, everyone like try a shot of this.
00:41:45 Like this is like,
00:41:46 he's just like half a shot
00:41:47 because this is like a fucking billion dollar bottle
00:41:49 or whatever.
00:41:50 Like this is like a million years old,
00:41:51 aged in like ancient China or something.
00:41:55 And I don't know,
00:41:56 they're taking shots of that.
00:41:58 And I was probably like sneaking shots of it
00:42:01 behind his back or something.
00:42:03 Cause like whatever, fuck it,
00:42:04 it's a bottle of whiskey.
00:42:06 And I remember,
00:42:09 I remember like a,
00:42:11 which is like a fire in someone's backyard.
00:42:14 And I remember writhing around.
00:42:16 He's like, this is like a super rare whiskey
00:42:18 and you're like, well,
00:42:19 that means I'm going to drink as much of it
00:42:21 as I possibly fucking can.
00:42:22 Oh, I should, I should get,
00:42:23 I should get as much as I can then.
00:42:25 Yeah.
00:42:26 I remember, I was,
00:42:27 I did end up on the ground in like the woods
00:42:31 next to their backyard,
00:42:32 just like vomiting.
00:42:34 That was bad.
00:42:35 That was really bad.
00:42:36 That's like the worst.
00:42:37 That's pretty romantic.
00:42:42 That was probably the worst,
00:42:43 like the worst a night of getting drunk I ever had.
00:42:49 I'm trying to remember any other fucking flip.
00:42:51 How, how much does a bee need to drink to get a buzz?
00:42:58 I think, okay,
00:43:00 does Jerry Seinfeld drink in the B movie?
00:43:05 I don't know.
00:43:06 I never watched the B movie.
00:43:07 Me either.
00:43:09 I've only seen big Joel's B movie video
00:43:12 and I've never seen the B movie,
00:43:14 but that video is a masterpiece.
00:43:16 Embarrassing.
00:43:18 No, it's good.
00:43:19 It's good.
00:43:20 I promise.
00:43:21 Wait, fuck.
00:43:23 I forgot.
00:43:24 I think I was going to say something
00:43:26 about the previous topic.
00:43:27 My favorite,
00:43:28 my favorite B movie is B movie.
00:43:31 Yeah, now I remember what I was going to say.
00:43:33 I need another drink.
00:43:34 I'm going to go get another drink.
00:43:36 You know, it's,
00:43:37 I wish I had some brute cuve.
00:43:39 I would, I would,
00:43:40 if I had a bottle of brute cuve,
00:43:42 did you, I would,
00:43:43 I would pop it right now.
00:43:45 Because we got to celebrate
00:43:46 that Joe Biden is the next president
00:43:48 of the United States, everybody.
00:43:50 We exorcised, we did it.
00:43:51 We restored the soul of the nation.
00:43:56 Nobody's clapping.
00:43:58 What?
00:43:59 Why is nobody clapping?
00:44:02 Get hype, guys.
00:44:07 Well, um...
00:44:09 That was the longest fucking pause.
00:44:11 I was waiting for somebody to say something.
00:44:14 No, nobody's going to say anything.
00:44:16 But...
00:44:17 Nobody else is riding with Biden like me.
00:44:21 Yeah, I guess you're the only one.
00:44:23 I guess it's just me.
00:44:24 That's bummer.
00:44:25 But uh...
00:44:26 It's bummer.
00:44:27 We have to restore the soul.
00:44:28 We have to restore the soul of the nation.
00:44:30 Actually,
00:44:31 my favorite thing about Joe Biden
00:44:33 is something that Trump tweeted about him.
00:44:37 I think,
00:44:38 I don't remember what he was talking about,
00:44:40 but at one point,
00:44:41 Joe Biden wasn't making many public appearances.
00:44:45 And then,
00:44:46 Trump tweeted,
00:44:48 Joe Biden, more like Joe Hayden.
00:44:52 That is a good one.
00:44:53 So...
00:44:54 I don't remember that one.
00:44:55 I feel like I would remember that one, but I don't.
00:44:57 You know, as the pun appreciator,
00:44:59 I had to give him
00:45:01 a thumbs up on that one.
00:45:03 Yeah.
00:45:04 Hey, Gamers Tavern.
00:45:05 You like video games,
00:45:07 obviously.
00:45:08 Do you like fighting games?
00:45:11 A little bit.
00:45:12 I like
00:45:14 Smash Bros.
00:45:15 and
00:45:17 sometimes I play Street Fighter.
00:45:19 Okay.
00:45:20 And Guilty Gear.
00:45:21 Guilty Gear is another one I really like.
00:45:23 Yes.
00:45:24 Good.
00:45:25 Good.
00:45:26 Good.
00:45:27 That's the answer I needed,
00:45:29 because
00:45:31 Steam just is having a big fucking fighting game sale
00:45:34 for some reason.
00:45:36 And it just so happened,
00:45:37 so there's a producer
00:45:40 who I've been working with,
00:45:42 who I know from Twitter,
00:45:43 called
00:45:45 David or Effie Gyros,
00:45:47 who came to visit
00:45:49 the house last weekend
00:45:51 to do a lecture
00:45:53 on Russell Greer,
00:45:55 who is a guy who sues celebrities
00:45:58 and is
00:46:00 he's a fun lolcow.
00:46:01 It's a pretty good lecture,
00:46:02 but...
00:46:03 Sounds like a stand-up.
00:46:04 Indeed.
00:46:06 And he
00:46:08 was playing Guilty Gear
00:46:10 Xurred.
00:46:11 And as I was playing,
00:46:13 I was realizing I wanted to switch my main
00:46:15 from Slayer
00:46:16 to Melia Rage,
00:46:17 who had been my backup
00:46:18 up until this point.
00:46:20 Mostly out of a desire to cosplay as her.
00:46:23 And then,
00:46:24 it just so happened,
00:46:25 as I was facing the dilemma of
00:46:27 I don't know if I want to hook up my PS4
00:46:29 to play
00:46:32 Guilty Gear Xurred Sign
00:46:34 when I don't even own Revelator
00:46:36 or X2.
00:46:38 And then, bam,
00:46:39 fighting games sale on Steam.
00:46:41 So what did I do?
00:46:42 I bought all the Guilty Gears,
00:46:43 all the Blazblues,
00:46:44 Melty Blood, finally.
00:46:46 They're sitting on my wish list for, like,
00:46:48 six years
00:46:50 and
00:46:51 and fucking
00:46:54 the Nitro Plus fighting game
00:46:56 where you can play a Saiyan or Uta.
00:46:59 No one knows what I'm talking about anymore.
00:47:02 No clue.
00:47:03 Absolutely no clue.
00:47:04 Well, in 2018,
00:47:06 I built myself a new computer
00:47:09 and around that time,
00:47:10 I got Steam and I bought
00:47:12 Guilty Gear Xurred.
00:47:14 And I played it and beat all the
00:47:17 you know, beat all the scenarios and stuff.
00:47:19 It's pretty good.
00:47:21 I agree.
00:47:22 I was a big fan of Guilty Gear back on the PS2.
00:47:27 My favorite was Guilty Gear X2
00:47:29 or XX or whatever.
00:47:31 But then I didn't
00:47:33 keep up with the series at all until Xurred came out.
00:47:37 I mean, that basically is the next game
00:47:39 because it was just remakes of X2
00:47:42 but with, like, more shit.
00:47:44 Yeah.
00:47:45 Actually, the last one I played before
00:47:47 I stopped playing Guilty Gear for so long
00:47:50 was Guilty Gear
00:47:52 Esuka on the PS2.
00:47:55 Yeah, that's the weird one that people don't like.
00:47:59 Yeah, and it sucked.
00:48:00 Is that like the MOBA one?
00:48:03 No, it was on the PS2.
00:48:05 It's kind of like,
00:48:06 they tried to make it more like Smash Brothers
00:48:10 because they had, like, four players.
00:48:12 You can play as four players
00:48:14 and you can turn left and right.
00:48:17 It was very weird and I didn't like it
00:48:20 and I think everybody hated it.
00:48:23 Nice.
00:48:24 I don't know if that killed the series for a while.
00:48:26 It's got mixed reviews on Steam
00:48:28 even though it's only $2.
00:48:30 I didn't bother with it.
00:48:33 Yeah, I remember it being pretty bad.
00:48:38 But Xurred is pretty good.
00:48:40 Xurred and X2 are both fucking gods here fighting games
00:48:44 and the Melee of Rage storyline in Xurred
00:48:48 made me have some feels.
00:48:50 So I was like, cool.
00:48:53 I'm really bad at fighting games.
00:48:56 I'm not amazing at them,
00:48:58 but I'm finally getting to a level where I kind of
00:49:00 understand the theory behind what I'm doing.
00:49:04 I learned throughout my youth how to,
00:49:10 I know what kind of character I can play well
00:49:13 and how to play that type of character,
00:49:15 but I don't really understand what I'm doing.
00:49:19 I wouldn't be able to explain to somebody.
00:49:22 I do a lot of jumping and going in and out.
00:49:24 Jumping around, going back and forth, in and out.
00:49:27 That doesn't make any sense,
00:49:29 but I'm starting to understand theoretically
00:49:32 what button presses I'm actually doing.
00:49:34 I'm not good at fighting games either,
00:49:39 but I've been playing them for a long time
00:49:41 and I feel like only just now
00:49:43 I understand the fundamentals enough
00:49:45 and I'm starting to get slightly better.
00:49:48 Good.
00:49:49 I played, oh man,
00:49:51 I fucking loved Street Fighter 2 Turbo
00:49:54 on the Super Nintendo.
00:49:56 That was like a childhood staple.
00:50:00 Who was your main in Street Fighter 2?
00:50:06 Jeez.
00:50:09 I don't know.
00:50:10 I guess I liked...
00:50:12 I played Cammie.
00:50:14 I didn't really have a main.
00:50:16 I liked spamming the fist with E Honda.
00:50:19 I liked spamming the fire spin with M Bison.
00:50:23 My strategy to spam the Hadoken was real.
00:50:28 No, I could never do the Hadoken.
00:50:31 I was like, I was so bad,
00:50:33 I could never do the Hadoken.
00:50:35 That's supposed to be the easiest move to do.
00:50:38 Well, not for me.
00:50:39 I did Throws.
00:50:40 No, I did the Sonic Boom with Gile
00:50:42 because I knew how to do that one.
00:50:44 I guess that's slightly easier,
00:50:46 but it takes more time.
00:50:48 Yeah, so I did...
00:50:51 It's really embarrassing to admit, actually.
00:50:54 I couldn't do the Hadoken.
00:50:55 I did not understand how to do...
00:50:57 I wasn't good enough to play Ryu.
00:50:59 I didn't understand how to do
00:51:01 semi-circle moves and all that kind of shit
00:51:03 until I was in my late teens.
00:51:05 Every time I played fighting games,
00:51:07 I was just mystified by the directional inputs
00:51:11 because they were usually based on a joystick movement.
00:51:15 Well, I guess I was playing N64 games on a joystick,
00:51:19 so I don't know.
00:51:20 Also, it would usually say punch-kick instead of A-B
00:51:24 and shit like that,
00:51:25 and I just didn't understand
00:51:27 how the buttons correlated to what I was doing.
00:51:29 It would just always be confusing enough
00:51:31 that I would look at the command list
00:51:33 and just be like, I don't get it
00:51:34 until finally it's over, and I was like...
00:51:36 In Guilty Gear.
00:51:37 In Guilty Gear,
00:51:38 because I was in high school when I was playing Guilty Gear,
00:51:40 and they had the quarter-circle moves,
00:51:43 which I understood with that man.
00:51:45 But then there were some other moves that had like...
00:51:47 It wasn't a quarter-circle,
00:51:48 it was sort of like a zigzag.
00:51:50 And that one, which to me was like,
00:51:54 oh, okay, so that just means like spaz out
00:51:57 on those two directions and hope that it works.
00:51:59 That's the Z motion,
00:52:00 which is I think known as a dragon punch motion.
00:52:04 It's like when you do the dragon punch
00:52:06 or the shoryuken with Ryu.
00:52:09 The shoryuken is like,
00:52:11 I would consider if you can teach someone
00:52:14 how to perform the shoryuken,
00:52:16 then you can teach them how to play fighting games.
00:52:18 It's like just knowing exactly how to do that motion
00:52:22 makes you understand...
00:52:24 When I was playing Guilty Gear,
00:52:26 I literally think,
00:52:27 even though I'd been playing this game for like 10 years,
00:52:29 and I'm fairly decent at it,
00:52:31 I'm not sure I had ever really understood
00:52:33 that if you press A while standing still
00:52:36 versus holding forward, it does two different moves.
00:52:39 Each one has a different distinct purpose,
00:52:42 but to me, my instinct is always to be moving,
00:52:45 to hold the character in a direction
00:52:47 that is corresponding to the enemy,
00:52:49 not to stand still and press a button
00:52:51 because I happen to know that the move
00:52:54 will be appropriate for this moment.
00:52:56 Instinctively, I guide my character towards the enemy.
00:52:59 I don't even know if I had fully comprehended
00:53:02 that I was doing two different moves,
00:53:04 but those are the kinds of things you need to know
00:53:07 to play fighting games,
00:53:09 that I think a lot of people have to fight their instincts
00:53:12 to figure out.
00:53:14 When I was a kid,
00:53:16 I didn't understand how to do any of this stuff,
00:53:18 so what I used to do was
00:53:20 I would put my fingers on the D-pad
00:53:22 and my thumbs on the D-pad and buttons,
00:53:25 and I would just rotate clockwise and counterclockwise,
00:53:29 and the moves would just come out randomly.
00:53:32 Like you were massaging it with your thumbs,
00:53:35 like going in circles.
00:53:37 Yeah, basically.
00:53:39 Sometimes I'd win that role.
00:53:41 It's not the worst strategy,
00:53:43 so a lot of students just activate supers all day.
00:53:45 Because they never know what's coming.
00:53:47 They never know what's coming.
00:53:49 Yeah, nobody knows what's coming, not even I do.
00:53:51 Yeah, exactly.
00:53:53 In terms of like...
00:53:59 I wouldn't say I'm good at games,
00:54:02 but I can beat games that just require patience.
00:54:05 Like something like Super Meat Boy,
00:54:08 that is basically just like do it over and over again
00:54:10 until you learn it.
00:54:12 I'm good at that kind of thing.
00:54:14 And I'm good at strategy games
00:54:17 and turn-based stuff.
00:54:19 I'm pretty good at Pokemon,
00:54:21 and I'm pretty good at chess.
00:54:23 For a noob who doesn't actually know
00:54:25 the theory of the game or anything.
00:54:27 But I'm really bad at fighting games.
00:54:29 I'm terrible.
00:54:31 I can't fucking do it.
00:54:35 When you say shooters, you mean them?
00:54:37 Obviously, I'm a champion at Slime Tassen.
00:54:39 Well, obviously.
00:54:41 Obviously, everybody knows that.
00:54:43 That's just the thing about me.
00:54:47 I just got a message on Twitter from someone.
00:54:50 It says,
00:55:02 I don't know who this person is at all.
00:55:04 Why are they telling me this?
00:55:08 I guess that's what happens when...
00:55:10 Twitter be wildin'.
00:55:11 I guess that's what happens when you're pretty popular.
00:55:13 Their name is Adam Jensen,
00:55:15 which is just the name of the main character from Deus Ex.
00:55:19 This is what a parasocial relationship is all about.
00:55:23 I guess so.
00:55:25 Tell you about like...
00:55:27 Oh man, trouble at my job.
00:55:29 I just thought it was very strange
00:55:32 that they were messaging me
00:55:34 and not like their mom or something.
00:55:37 Maybe they don't have any.
00:55:39 Did you see the thing on Twitter?
00:55:42 It was a new thing going around.
00:55:44 The Asian girl saying that Poggers is racist.
00:55:47 I have not.
00:55:49 What is this about?
00:55:51 Well, it's just what it sounds like.
00:55:53 Is it Poggers British?
00:55:55 Isn't it British Slime?
00:55:58 You don't...
00:55:59 Do you not know what Poggers is?
00:56:01 Well, I actually do not know what Poggers is.
00:56:03 I guess I'm about to find out.
00:56:04 I have no idea what it is.
00:56:05 You...
00:56:06 Poggers.
00:56:07 When your wife's boyfriend lets you sleep past 8 p.m.
00:56:10 That's the top definition.
00:56:13 Wife's boyfriend.
00:56:14 You have five more minutes.
00:56:15 Me.
00:56:16 Poggers.
00:56:17 Poggers, a Twitch emote that may only be seen
00:56:19 if you have better TTV installed.
00:56:21 I thought it was maybe a reference to Pogs.
00:56:25 Remember Pogs?
00:56:27 It is a reference to Pogs.
00:56:30 I didn't know this.
00:56:31 Yeah, it's the face.
00:56:32 It's the face of that guy going,
00:56:33 Oh!
00:56:34 I see.
00:56:36 I guess it's from...
00:56:38 He said...
00:56:39 I guess he was playing Pogs or something
00:56:41 and he said he was the Pogchamp
00:56:43 and he called himself the Pogchamp.
00:56:45 So Poggers and Pogchamp are basically the same thing.
00:56:48 I see.
00:56:49 But anyway, he's an Asian guy
00:56:51 so this thread is this girl saying like
00:56:53 actually, non-POC people using Poggers
00:56:58 in moments of non-POC joy or enthusiasm
00:57:01 has a deep racial connotations
00:57:03 and is extremely racist and problematic.
00:57:05 And obviously, this attracts a huge amount of like
00:57:09 oh my god, I can't believe this is the discourse now.
00:57:12 I literally just thought that Poggers
00:57:14 was like common British slang.
00:57:17 No, no, it's Twitch slang.
00:57:19 What British phrase am I confusing this with?
00:57:22 Like, don't they have a word that's just like
00:57:25 oh, Poggers!
00:57:27 That's how I've been reading it the entire time.
00:57:30 I had no idea it was like a new meme.
00:57:33 I mean, it's not super new.
00:57:36 It's only British if you have a top hat and a monocle.
00:57:40 That's so fucking funny.
00:57:42 Anyway, the post turned out to be fucking bait.
00:57:45 It wasn't even real so I got fucking baited.
00:57:47 I got had.
00:57:49 Would you say you're a master baiter?
00:57:53 No, I was masterly baited though, which is better
00:57:58 by a cute Asian girl on Twitter.
00:58:01 And I say she's cute because she had a little cartoon avatar
00:58:04 and that's cute.
00:58:06 That's good enough for me.
00:58:08 And her pronouns were she, her, and she's bisexual
00:58:10 so that's pretty hot as well.
00:58:13 So I guess it was originally there was PogChamp
00:58:18 which is the Asian dude and he's the older emote
00:58:21 and then recently there's a Pepe the Frog version of his face
00:58:26 which is Poggers.
00:58:29 I think Poggers is just like the colloquial version of PogChamp.
00:58:37 Well, I'm just going by what nobody or me is telling me.
00:58:40 I'm sure there's a Pepe Poggers.
00:58:42 Well, when it comes to all the new internet lingo
00:58:45 I'm kind of a boomer in that regard.
00:58:47 I don't keep up with all this stuff.
00:58:49 When your wife's boyfriend lets you sleep at 8 p.m.
00:58:54 That's a pretty good joke.
00:58:56 It's Poggers, Poggers know you only see this fucking,
00:58:59 let me see this rare Pepe.
00:59:01 Rare Pepe.
00:59:03 No, I don't know.
00:59:05 No, I don't know.
00:59:06 There's a Pepe for everything.
00:59:09 I love that boy.
00:59:12 Love that boy.
00:59:14 He's back.
00:59:15 We've taken him back.
00:59:16 We've reclaimed him.
00:59:18 He's wholesome again.
00:59:20 Did you see the fucking shit?
00:59:23 Listen, I'll keep talking about fucking Twitter drama
00:59:26 until someone stops me.
00:59:28 Did you see the thing about Movie Bob and Lindsay Ellis?
00:59:30 No, but I might be interested.
00:59:34 I know Lindsay Ellis, but I don't know Movie Bob.
00:59:41 Gamers Tavern, Movie Bob.
00:59:44 Oh God, I fucking...
00:59:47 He's a big fat dude who talks about movies and video games.
00:59:52 As a movie critic, I don't think he's terrible.
00:59:55 Yeah, that's fine.
00:59:57 I used to be a big fan of The Big Picture.
01:00:00 There's so much more to him.
01:00:03 There's so much more to Movie Bob than just that.
01:00:06 The way he presents his whole personality
01:00:09 on the outside of his videos is just arrogant
01:00:13 and cunt-y about being a liberal and stuff.
01:00:18 It's that...
01:00:20 Yeah, he's a certain brand of smug liberal.
01:00:25 He is self-described.
01:00:28 He's salty about being bullied as a kid.
01:00:31 He hates the people that remind him
01:00:34 of the people that bullied him in high school.
01:00:36 He's the big part of his fucking brand.
01:00:39 He's very much like...
01:00:42 Not in these words, but he's very much like
01:00:44 fuck-poor people, they vote Trump or whatever.
01:00:47 He's that kind of lib.
01:00:51 He is very...
01:00:54 I mean, didn't DeVoo used to say
01:00:57 that he was thinking of doing a lecture on the lore of...
01:01:01 What was that fucking...
01:01:03 Was it The Big Picture that had the skits?
01:01:06 On which show?
01:01:09 I know who DeVoo is now, but I don't know what you're talking about.
01:01:13 Movie Bob skits were on his Game Overthinker show.
01:01:17 Yeah, Game Overthinker.
01:01:20 I don't know.
01:01:21 The Game Overthinker skits were like...
01:01:23 Fucking terrible.
01:01:24 Next level embarrassing.
01:01:25 Unbelievably fucking bad.
01:01:27 It was so bad.
01:01:29 And he did them for years.
01:01:30 There's like hundreds and hundreds of them.
01:01:32 And he just kept doing it.
01:01:33 And I remember people telling him,
01:01:35 like, hey, you know, I like your movie criticism,
01:01:38 but these fucking skits are cringe and embarrassing
01:01:41 and I hate them.
01:01:42 And he was just like, listen,
01:01:44 they make the...
01:01:45 Stop telling me, they make the show better.
01:01:48 I'm not going to take them, even if everyone hates them.
01:01:50 I'm going to keep doing them, because I like them
01:01:53 and I think they make the show good.
01:01:55 And it's like an even worse version
01:02:00 of a guy with a glass of stuff.
01:02:02 How like he'll have himself in like various costumes
01:02:06 that all play like different roles.
01:02:08 And it's like the version of him
01:02:10 who is like a nostalgic 90s gamer
01:02:12 and the version of him that is like an 80s,
01:02:15 like Grimdark edgy comic character.
01:02:17 Yeah, I think I know.
01:02:18 I know what you're talking about.
01:02:20 Yeah.
01:02:21 Okay, okay.
01:02:22 Anyway, enough.
01:02:23 The point is, there was something,
01:02:25 it was this backstory.
01:02:28 Peter Coffin, who I assume you guys don't know,
01:02:31 but Peter Coffin is a lefty YouTuber.
01:02:34 He's a big fucking communist.
01:02:36 And he's kind of, people criticize and people say
01:02:39 he's like too much of a class reductionist
01:02:41 and he's like, no, I'm not that stupid, blah, blah, blah.
01:02:43 So he's...
01:02:44 So there's tension there.
01:02:45 There's tension between him and so-called bread tube, right?
01:02:48 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:02:49 And he...
01:02:50 Peter Coffin?
01:02:51 Okay.
01:02:52 Does he live in a coffin?
01:02:53 Yeah.
01:02:54 He lives in...
01:02:56 Sorry, go on.
01:03:00 So he...
01:03:01 So, and one day, he fucking snaps.
01:03:05 He becomes the joker.
01:03:07 He gets joker-fied.
01:03:08 He can't take it anymore.
01:03:10 And he's like, I'm sick and tired of these bougie libs
01:03:14 telling people to vote for Biden.
01:03:16 And he blocks all of what he perceives as bread tube, right?
01:03:22 He blocks Big Joel, and he blocks Jack Sane,
01:03:26 and he blocks Sean, and he blocks H-Bomber Guy,
01:03:29 and he blocks Lindsay Ellis,
01:03:31 and he blocks Jenny Nicholson,
01:03:33 and he blocks Thought Slime.
01:03:35 Thought Slime of all people.
01:03:37 Unbelievable.
01:03:38 So he does this, and everyone's like, hmm,
01:03:42 what a fucking nerd.
01:03:43 Everyone's like...
01:03:44 Like, no one's like...
01:03:45 Everyone's like, that's pretty dumb.
01:03:46 That's pretty dumb move, like, stupid.
01:03:49 And Lindsay Ellis makes a comment in it somewhere
01:03:53 about how, like, he seems to think that it's a big cabal
01:03:56 when actually it's just people that are friends with each other
01:03:58 to talk, right?
01:03:59 It's like...
01:04:00 And Bob replies.
01:04:02 Movie Bob replies like, hmm, I know, right?
01:04:05 We're all just pals.
01:04:07 And he posts a picture of him and Lindsay,
01:04:09 and they're like, he's got her arm around her,
01:04:11 and he's giving her thumbs up, and they're smiling.
01:04:13 And Lindsay replies like, dude,
01:04:15 this is really inappropriate and creepy.
01:04:18 Don't post this.
01:04:20 The fact that we took a picture together at a con years ago
01:04:22 doesn't mean we're friends.
01:04:24 I've soft-blocked you, like, six times,
01:04:26 and you haven't got the hint.
01:04:27 Please leave me alone.
01:04:29 And Bob is utterly destroyed.
01:04:33 It's like...
01:04:36 It's like the greatest...
01:04:38 It's like the most horrendous,
01:04:40 like a second-hand embarrassment moment
01:04:44 of the...
01:04:46 So far of the millennium, I would say.
01:04:49 Bob's reality shatters.
01:04:51 He, too, like Peter Coffin before him,
01:04:54 now must go full Joker mode
01:04:56 and simply watch the world burn.
01:04:59 There's nothing left for him.
01:05:02 I don't know. This was all over the place.
01:05:04 You guys are listening totally non-plus.
01:05:07 This doesn't mean anything to you,
01:05:09 but to me, this was Earth Shattering.
01:05:11 I'm glad you had a good time.
01:05:13 I had a great fucking time.
01:05:16 Fucking Movie Bob.
01:05:18 Fucking Movie Bob, man.
01:05:20 That was a huge supporter.
01:05:22 Also, Lindsay Ellis isn't Bread Tube. She's a fucking lib.
01:05:24 But that's a discussion for another day.
01:05:26 Mo was a huge supporter of enjoying
01:05:29 the suffering and misery of others.
01:05:32 Yeah.
01:05:34 I think there's a word for that.
01:05:36 I heard Bread Tube, then I started reading other comments
01:05:39 and lost track of what was being said.
01:05:41 It wasn't even about that.
01:05:43 The point was about Bob is a fucking loser who got owned.
01:05:46 I'm not surprised by that.
01:05:48 I don't think that would happen.
01:05:50 Bob is a loser who gets owned.
01:05:53 I mean, it's just like, he's a big YouTuber.
01:05:56 Like, he is.
01:05:58 As much as people find him, he's a big YouTuber.
01:06:00 Lindsay is a big YouTuber.
01:06:02 And generally, these people try to maintain
01:06:04 a sort of professional courtesy to each other.
01:06:06 So it's like, imagine what it must take
01:06:08 to make one of them just straight up tell the other one,
01:06:10 like, don't even reply to my fucking posts, weirdo.
01:06:13 Imagine how much it must have been building to come to that.
01:06:17 I mean, I really do think the stereotype
01:06:23 of anyone who's a guy who's way too much of an ally
01:06:30 is probably because they just can't make friends
01:06:36 or manage connections.
01:06:38 They have to...
01:06:40 It's like the overexertion
01:06:43 to constantly insist upon how righteous you are.
01:06:47 It's like, all right.
01:06:50 Are you assuming that everyone else isn't accepting
01:06:55 or feeling this way?
01:06:57 I don't know.
01:06:59 It feels like movie Bob is somebody who thinks
01:07:01 that almost everyone in the world is evil and out to get him.
01:07:05 And that's only the case because of the fact
01:07:08 that he treats everybody that way.
01:07:11 He's very...
01:07:13 There's a tweet of his that says,
01:07:16 like, oh, I think it was after Trump got elected.
01:07:19 He tweeted, like, don't you ever tell me that I'm wrong
01:07:23 to look down my nose at the rest of humanity or something.
01:07:26 She's a race.
01:07:28 It sounds like school shooter talks, bro.
01:07:30 It is.
01:07:32 For real, it is.
01:07:34 Saying that sort of thing is cool when it's ironic.
01:07:37 It would be funny if it was ironic.
01:07:40 But unfortunately, it's movie Bob.
01:07:43 You know that he can't do that.
01:07:46 You know, I was surprised.
01:07:48 I checked Lindsey's channel recently
01:07:50 because I haven't seen anything from her for a while.
01:07:53 And I was really astonished.
01:07:55 She has, I think, over a million subscribers now.
01:07:58 Did she cross a million?
01:08:00 I think, I'm not sure.
01:08:02 That's a lot of fucking subscribers.
01:08:04 Wait, let me...
01:08:06 Because I first found out...
01:08:08 Back when I first found out about her,
01:08:10 she was much, much smaller.
01:08:13 Well, I mean, she was the fucking nostalgia chick, right?
01:08:18 Yeah, that's when I first learned of her.
01:08:20 Ben, why don't we have a million subscribers?
01:08:23 You and I.
01:08:25 Um...
01:08:27 I don't...
01:08:29 Well, I can...
01:08:32 I mean, I can answer that question in several ways,
01:08:35 but I do find it...
01:08:38 I do find it interesting to see, like,
01:08:41 who blows up and why.
01:08:45 And, like...
01:08:47 It seems like it's always people who...
01:08:51 I don't know, it sounds stupid.
01:08:53 Talk about current things when they come out.
01:08:56 I was gonna say, it's always people who, like, you've been hearing about.
01:09:00 I don't know, it's people that you've heard about before
01:09:03 and you've heard about them for a long time, right?
01:09:05 And you've heard about them over and over again.
01:09:07 And then you finally get around to checking them out
01:09:09 and you're like, oh, yeah, okay.
01:09:11 They have a million...
01:09:13 And I don't know, I feel like it happens through a combination...
01:09:16 A combination of, like, successful algorithm usage,
01:09:19 as well as...
01:09:21 I mean, connections are definitely a part of it, right?
01:09:23 Like, Lindsay is, like, a well-connected person.
01:09:26 Yeah, but the thing is,
01:09:28 not everybody who's been doing it for a long time
01:09:31 gets that super popular because...
01:09:34 Obviously.
01:09:35 Before the Game Grumps, there used to be a ton of let's players
01:09:38 that were kind of slightly popular,
01:09:41 but many of them now are, like, nobodies.
01:09:44 They have...
01:09:46 You know, they barely have any subscribers anymore.
01:09:49 And...
01:09:50 I got?
01:09:51 You know, like...
01:09:52 I got into it.
01:09:53 Yeah, yeah.
01:09:54 I think one of the only old pre-Game Grumps let's players
01:09:57 that actually managed to get over a million subscribers
01:10:00 is Shaga Konroy.
01:10:02 I don't know if you're familiar with him.
01:10:05 I know of him.
01:10:07 But most of his friends who know him and work with him,
01:10:11 they still don't even have, like, 500,000 subscribers.
01:10:16 And they're, like, struggling now.
01:10:19 I mean...
01:10:21 Is it struggling to have 500,000 subscribers?
01:10:25 Well, some of them are as low as 200,000.
01:10:28 I mean, you say that, but that's a lot of subscribers.
01:10:31 Well, the view count matters more.
01:10:33 Like, I saw...
01:10:34 Oh, yeah.
01:10:35 There was one let's player.
01:10:36 I think his name is Josh Jepsen.
01:10:38 You know, way back in 2006.
01:10:41 He still does stuff now.
01:10:44 His channel has 200,000 subscribers,
01:10:46 but I think he only gets, like, 2,000 views per video.
01:10:49 Sometimes less.
01:10:51 It's...
01:10:52 Yeah, it's...
01:10:53 You know what it is?
01:10:54 It's like a centralization thing.
01:10:58 Like, the big people attract all the attention,
01:11:02 and people gravitate towards the biggest people.
01:11:07 And, yeah, it sucks up attention.
01:11:10 I'm sure that's part of it.
01:11:12 But it does seem a little unfair to see an old YouTuber
01:11:15 who's been doing it for, like, 10 years,
01:11:18 and they just never really...
01:11:20 They never blow up.
01:11:23 I was arguing on Twitter about this.
01:11:25 I think it was, like, two weeks ago.
01:11:28 Most people agreed with me, but a couple people didn't.
01:11:31 And I said that, like...
01:11:33 Basically, it was, like, PewDiePie.
01:11:36 Like, in my opinion, there's almost nothing special
01:11:39 about PewDiePie.
01:11:40 PewDiePie is proof that, like, success is basically random.
01:11:44 Like, yeah, he did do all the right things to succeed.
01:11:48 He's very good-looking.
01:11:52 Okay, okay, okay.
01:11:54 Well, okay, when I say that it's random,
01:11:56 it's not that I mean that, like,
01:11:58 he has nothing going for him but succeeded anyway, no.
01:12:01 He has things going for him.
01:12:03 They're just pretty common things
01:12:05 that you would think that lots of people could do.
01:12:07 Yeah, he's pretty good-looking, he's fairly charismatic,
01:12:09 and he, you know, posted the right way.
01:12:13 He did the things the algorithm demanded of him, right?
01:12:16 He did all the right things.
01:12:18 But so do tons of people.
01:12:20 Tons of other people have all those things
01:12:22 that have done it the right way,
01:12:24 but they're not PewDiePie,
01:12:26 and there's basically no reason for it except, like,
01:12:28 just complete random chance.
01:12:30 I think people underestimate how important it is
01:12:32 to just, like, have big hits and multiples of them
01:12:36 because your real hit videos are so much more important
01:12:42 than any other ones.
01:12:44 Like, if you have a video that gets 10 million views,
01:12:47 10 videos that get 1 million views, you know?
01:12:50 Like, but not only that,
01:12:52 it is more likely to continue getting views
01:12:55 in those other ones because, like,
01:12:57 there is kind of a snowballing effect with YouTube
01:12:59 where, like, my biggest video,
01:13:01 the one that has, like, 3.5 million views,
01:13:03 continues to this day to be my best performing video
01:13:06 month after month, like...
01:13:08 I mean, same with me in the Sonichi lecture.
01:13:11 Yeah, it's just the way the algorithm works.
01:13:13 It just says, like, people already liked this,
01:13:15 or people will like this.
01:13:17 That's kind of the trouble of the algorithm.
01:13:20 It just promotes what's already popular.
01:13:22 Right.
01:13:23 So I think with PewDiePie,
01:13:25 like, I remember distinctly
01:13:28 that when he was first blowing up,
01:13:30 I remember, like, certain thumbnails
01:13:32 that would continually be in my sidebar.
01:13:34 So it wasn't, like, every PewDiePie video blew up.
01:13:38 It's like, he probably had, like, 10 or so videos
01:13:41 during his big upswing period
01:13:43 that were, like, huge tentpole,
01:13:46 you know, tens of millions of view videos
01:13:49 that were, like, every subscriber he earned
01:13:52 was from those.
01:13:53 And any other video he has
01:13:55 is being watched by people who are already subscribed.
01:13:57 But, like, if the video doesn't escape your audience,
01:14:00 then it just isn't adding to your subscribers.
01:14:03 So, like, any time a channel blows up in sub-count,
01:14:06 it's always because they're writing off of some video
01:14:08 that, like, really took off,
01:14:10 and usually, in the modern cold environment,
01:14:13 if that video is not, like, at least 20 minutes long,
01:14:16 it's not gonna leave enough of an impression on people
01:14:18 to, like, subscribe, you know?
01:14:20 Like...
01:14:21 Yeah.
01:14:22 There's always most...
01:14:23 Yeah, most YouTubers will have, like,
01:14:25 they'll have, like, one video that does really well,
01:14:28 and that's, like, the start of their career,
01:14:30 pretty much.
01:14:31 More or less.
01:14:32 Like, I remember, I remember Jack...
01:14:34 Jack Saints was, um,
01:14:36 he did the video about how, like, Sky...
01:14:38 The, like...
01:14:39 The, like, straight-to-video Disney movie Sky High
01:14:43 is, like, fascist propaganda,
01:14:45 and that one went pretty viral,
01:14:47 and I think that was, like, he went from, like,
01:14:50 in the 10Ks to, like, 100K or something for that,
01:14:53 and that was, like, okay, now we're doing it.
01:14:56 Um, and I, you know...
01:14:58 Uh, you know, I got the...
01:15:00 The only reason anyone watches my channel at all
01:15:02 is because of the Sonichu lecture,
01:15:04 which, just for whatever reason,
01:15:06 cracked a million, which is, like...
01:15:09 Yeah.
01:15:10 Uh, good job.
01:15:11 Uh...
01:15:12 Yeah, you're totally right about that.
01:15:14 You were talking about, like, uh,
01:15:16 people who, like, fall off,
01:15:18 and, uh, have you heard of the YouTuber Danny Mullen?
01:15:21 Uh...
01:15:22 No.
01:15:23 Uh, so he's a pretty funny and good, uh,
01:15:26 like, man on the street,
01:15:28 like, basically him and his team
01:15:30 will just, like, bomb into a town
01:15:31 and just start messing with people
01:15:33 and, like, seeing what happens,
01:15:35 but he is a very good way of making people like him.
01:15:39 Like, even though he fucks with people,
01:15:41 he will turn it around so that he's the good guy,
01:15:43 or, like, just make people enjoy the experience.
01:15:46 It's a, it's pretty fun to watch,
01:15:48 but, um, he did a video about a YouTuber
01:15:51 who had been, like, an early influence on him,
01:15:54 this guy who was called, uh...
01:15:56 Oh, let's see here, what was it?
01:15:58 It's...
01:15:59 This reminds me of, uh, I think Kassim G,
01:16:02 have you heard of him?
01:16:04 Over...
01:16:05 No.
01:16:06 Sorry, Overboard Humor was the name of the guy who he goes
01:16:08 to hang out with this dude who was, like,
01:16:10 an early prank star on YouTube
01:16:12 who had, like, a millions of subs,
01:16:14 made a shitload of money,
01:16:16 spent it all, uh,
01:16:18 you know, fucked up his life, got into drugs,
01:16:20 and now he lives in a tent in the woods,
01:16:22 and, uh, just, like...
01:16:24 Jesus.
01:16:25 Basically goes around asking people for drugs
01:16:28 so he can sell the drugs,
01:16:29 because people are more likely to give you drugs than money.
01:16:33 And, uh, yeah.
01:16:35 So, Danny Mullen, who is currently successful,
01:16:38 and obviously, like, fascinated with this guy,
01:16:40 like, goes out to spend 24 hours with him
01:16:43 and, like, uh, try to, you know, help him out.
01:16:47 Like, he goes into it, like,
01:16:49 I don't know if I'm gonna hate this guy or like this guy
01:16:51 or, like, want to help him out by the end,
01:16:53 and in the end, he does kind of find him to be, like,
01:16:55 kind of pathetic and try to give him a little bit of help, but, uh...
01:16:58 Wait, how long is this video? Is it, like, a documentary?
01:17:00 Yeah, it's, like, 45 minutes long.
01:17:02 I might check that out. That sounds pretty cool.
01:17:04 Yeah, I think you'll like that one,
01:17:06 and Danny Mullen's pretty fun in general,
01:17:08 but that video in particular...
01:17:09 You know, uh, success in all walks of life
01:17:11 has a combination of what you do
01:17:13 and also luck being in the right place and right time,
01:17:17 and how much luck and how much skill
01:17:20 depends on what the market is
01:17:22 and what you're doing exactly.
01:17:24 Mm-hmm.
01:17:25 And I think on YouTube, uh, there's a lot of...
01:17:28 There's probably more luck involved than in other, uh, fields,
01:17:33 but it's not all luck, obviously.
01:17:35 Yeah.
01:17:36 Oh, and YouTube and I think so.
01:17:38 Like, in some fields, like, it's like if you...
01:17:42 If you put the work in, you'll eventually get something.
01:17:45 On the Internet, you might...
01:17:49 You might never get anywhere,
01:17:51 and it might not even be your fault.
01:17:53 Yeah, that's true.
01:17:55 But there are some fields that are almost 100%
01:18:00 based on your abilities.
01:18:01 Like, if you become a professional fighting game player,
01:18:07 like a professional Smash player,
01:18:09 then how much money you make...
01:18:11 Well, to a certain extent, yes.
01:18:15 I would argue that, like,
01:18:18 it's not like just anyone could become,
01:18:21 like, a top-level fighting game player,
01:18:24 no matter how much they practiced.
01:18:26 I think you do kind of have to just have, like,
01:18:28 the natural ability to be, like, a top-level player at that.
01:18:32 So I think, to a certain extent,
01:18:34 you have to be lucky for that, too.
01:18:36 Yeah.
01:18:37 But, I mean, you do have to, like, perform.
01:18:39 I think, um...
01:18:40 But what I mean is how much money you make in that field
01:18:43 is directly influenced by how you perform,
01:18:48 your performance.
01:18:49 There's no, like...
01:18:50 Sure, yeah, it's true.
01:18:51 Outside of your genetics, there's no luck element to that.
01:18:53 It's not like you can, like, win tons of tournaments,
01:18:56 but, like, get screwed over by the algorithm or whatever.
01:19:00 Yeah, exactly.
01:19:01 Well, the thing about it with doing creative work
01:19:04 is that, like, quality is irrelevant to success.
01:19:08 It's about what people want.
01:19:10 And what people want, like, they often don't know that.
01:19:14 Like, you can't just ask people what they want
01:19:16 and then give them that.
01:19:17 You have to create something that they will then realize
01:19:19 that they want.
01:19:20 But, like, that can be...
01:19:23 Like, there's a...
01:19:25 On one level, you have to be able to identify...
01:19:28 It sounds so easy.
01:19:29 Well, there's identifying what people want,
01:19:32 which I don't find to be that difficult.
01:19:34 Like, I think that if you just observe, like,
01:19:37 what people are already enjoying
01:19:38 and then just iterate on that in, like, a, you know, logical way,
01:19:42 it's not terribly difficult to come up with something people will want.
01:19:46 It's, do you actually want to do that?
01:19:48 Like...
01:19:49 Yeah.
01:19:50 Most of the time, when people are doing creative work,
01:19:52 it's more out of personal fulfillment
01:19:54 and, like, trying to bridge the gap between, like,
01:19:56 how can I make this fulfilling for me and the audience?
01:19:59 That's the difficult part.
01:20:01 Like, making something that just fulfills the audience,
01:20:04 like, I think that a lot of the most successful directors
01:20:08 who make, like, really big pop media,
01:20:10 the reason they're able to do it
01:20:12 is that they just sincerely want to entertain the audience.
01:20:15 Like, they're like, I want to make the thing
01:20:17 that's gonna make people go, whoa, the most!
01:20:20 And, like, if that's the way you feel,
01:20:22 then, like, you're perfect to do that kind of thing.
01:20:25 Whereas if you're somebody who's like,
01:20:27 I have to get this thing off of my chest
01:20:29 and everybody needs to hear it,
01:20:30 then it's like you're in a very difficult position.
01:20:32 I think if you want to be, like, mainstream successful,
01:20:35 you have to...
01:20:36 Or it probably helps a lot to be someone who just, like,
01:20:39 really, really enjoys, like, unironically,
01:20:44 like, the kind of, like, you know...
01:20:47 The kind of thing you're making.
01:20:49 I mean, everybody kind of tries to make something
01:20:51 that is close to what they themselves like, you know?
01:20:55 Yeah, I think if you love, like, you know,
01:20:58 really broad, kind of, like, not basic shit, I guess,
01:21:01 you know, like, really, like, mass appeal shit,
01:21:03 and you're like, oh, fuck yeah, this is cool.
01:21:06 Even if I've seen it a hundred times before,
01:21:08 but this is like a cool thing, too.
01:21:11 I want to make something that's like this thing
01:21:14 that everybody already likes because it's what I like.
01:21:16 I mean, that's probably pretty good.
01:21:19 Like, that's probably not going to hurt you.
01:21:21 If what appeals to you is also what appeals to the masses.
01:21:24 Yeah, that's a great decision.
01:21:26 But if what appeals to you doesn't appeal to anyone else,
01:21:28 then you're kind of out of luck.
01:21:30 Totally boned. Totally fucking boned.
01:21:33 That's the position I've been in, unfortunately,
01:21:35 is everything that I want to copy is already not popular, so...
01:21:40 I'm like...
01:21:42 Every time I think... I don't know, I can't...
01:21:45 I'm going to funk. I'm going to funk lately,
01:21:47 because I'm like, everything that I might think...
01:21:51 I can't even imagine, like, finding an idea interesting.
01:21:55 Do you know what I mean?
01:21:57 Yeah, I can't even imagine, like, thinking of something.
01:22:00 Like, say I thought and being like,
01:22:02 man, I should, like, make a project.
01:22:06 I should, like, see this idea through to fulfillment,
01:22:08 because it would be like, it would add something to the world,
01:22:11 or to culture, or people would be interested in it.
01:22:13 Everything that I think of, it's like,
01:22:15 okay, well, I thought of it. It's old.
01:22:17 Like, if I thought of it, everybody must know it already.
01:22:20 Everybody must be familiar with it.
01:22:22 Um, it's boring.
01:22:24 This is a problem of the lockdown,
01:22:27 making it so you're not out there talking to people,
01:22:29 finding out what they want from you.
01:22:31 I think it's true to...
01:22:33 I think it's true that lockdown and me not social...
01:22:36 I think socializing with people is a big source of, like,
01:22:39 is a big source of inspiration that I don't have anymore,
01:22:42 and it's making me depressed.
01:22:44 Um, and I...
01:22:46 I think when you're talking and you're bouncing ideas off people,
01:22:51 like new people, meeting people and stuff,
01:22:53 then you're like, you have a flow of ideas that is, like, stimulating,
01:22:57 and you might have a fucking...
01:22:59 Your fucking neurons might occasionally fire and have a brain blast
01:23:02 because of all the random stimulation you're providing with them.
01:23:05 Not so for me now.
01:23:06 Now, my neurons are fucking dead.
01:23:08 They're all fucking dead. They're asleep.
01:23:10 And I killed them.
01:23:11 They went to sleep, and then I killed them in their sleep
01:23:13 by drinking too much fucking barefoot bubbly...
01:23:16 Yeah, I was gonna say, you probably shouldn't have gotten blackout drunk so many times.
01:23:20 Well, it's too late. I fucking did.
01:23:23 But, uh, that's why, uh, a lot of sitcoms...
01:23:26 A lot of sitcoms, they have, like, writer's rooms,
01:23:28 and, uh, there's a lot of writers in there,
01:23:31 and they bounce ideas off of each other.
01:23:33 It helps you talk to other people when you're trying to come up with stuff.
01:23:37 Yeah, Ben, write a sitcom.
01:23:40 Okay.
01:23:42 You know, that's actually...
01:23:44 I kind of wish I could do that.
01:23:45 You would be an amazing sitcom character,
01:23:47 so I think you would write a good sitcom also.
01:23:50 I bet I could write for a sitcom pretty well.
01:23:55 But, like, I say that.
01:23:58 But imagine, imagining, like, okay, I have that idea,
01:24:03 and I'm like, yeah, I bet, yeah, I could probably be a sitcom writer.
01:24:06 But then I'm like, what if I, like, how stupid would it be
01:24:10 if I were to, like, what would I even do?
01:24:13 Like, I go, and I'm like, hmm, I know.
01:24:16 I'll sit down at my computer, and I'll open up fucking Microsoft Word,
01:24:21 and I will, like, type, like, uh, uh, you know, script,
01:24:25 and go down and start, like, writing,
01:24:28 and start, like, coming up with, like, dialogue
01:24:31 to just, like, hmm, what's this, what's this,
01:24:33 like, I can't fucking do that.
01:24:34 That's so cringe. That's so stupid.
01:24:36 I would never do such a thing.
01:24:38 I don't think it's that bad. That's what I do for, uh, my stuff.
01:24:41 That sounds horrible. I would die.
01:24:43 I would die of shame if I even...
01:24:45 Well, then just draw it as a storyboard
01:24:47 and then take the pictures out.
01:24:48 That also makes me want to die of shame.
01:24:51 Drawing a comic? Imagine.
01:24:53 No, a storyboard. Do it, like, originally.
01:24:56 That's just a comic. It's just the same thing.
01:24:58 Yeah, but, like, layout. Do it with the storyboard layout.
01:25:01 No, no, no. I would have to have ideas.
01:25:03 I would have to have ideas to that,
01:25:05 and having ideas is fucking embarrassing.
01:25:07 It's stupid. It's a stupid waste of time.
01:25:10 You should kill yourself if you even consider it.
01:25:13 I am going to kill myself right now.
01:25:17 Do we have anything else we want to talk about,
01:25:19 or should we go to voicemail?
01:25:21 I don't know. How long have we been going?
01:25:23 An hour and a half?
01:25:24 An hour and a half, yeah.
01:25:25 Okay.
01:25:26 Well, um, yeah, we can go to voicemail.
01:25:27 Gamer, Gamer Statham, do you want to listen to voicemails with us?
01:25:30 Or is there anything else you wanted to talk about
01:25:32 before we move on?
01:25:34 Uh, yeah, we can go to voicemails if you want.
01:25:36 I mean, it's, uh, your show.
01:25:38 That's true.
01:25:40 It's, it's, it's, uh, okay.
01:25:42 Okay, okay, let me, let me get them.
01:25:44 I got them here.
01:25:45 Uh, I will post them in the general.
01:25:47 Uh, we will go in order.
01:25:49 This first one, here we go.
01:25:52 This first one is called Bob misses the samurai.
01:25:56 Uh, let's start it in three, two, one, go.
01:26:01 Okay.
01:26:02 I'm sure this will be horribly irrelevant.
01:26:05 Yeah.
01:26:06 By the time this goes in, but I just want to say that I fucking hate
01:26:10 all of the conversations about circumcision.
01:26:13 It's super boring.
01:26:15 Yeah, I agree.
01:26:16 That's why every single episode I say it's over.
01:26:18 Stop asking me about it.
01:26:19 It's super boring to know that I might be missing out on
01:26:22 extra cool feelings as a bisexual man.
01:26:28 It's so much easier to suck circumcised dick.
01:26:31 It's just, it's just, it's just easier as.
01:26:36 Huh.
01:26:37 Hey man.
01:26:38 Don't see why or how.
01:26:40 As.
01:26:41 Maybe he looks like.
01:26:42 My ex has a kid and his circumcision was botched
01:26:45 and that fucking sucks.
01:26:47 Yeah.
01:26:48 His dick looks super weird.
01:26:50 I guess my point is doctors learn how to do circumcisions
01:26:54 and just do it to everyone.
01:26:55 Fuck this whole conversation.
01:26:57 Wait, so this guy's pro circumcision.
01:26:59 I think so.
01:27:00 He just seemed to think it was easier to suck a circumcised
01:27:03 dick, which I don't understand how or why that would be the case.
01:27:07 I don't really get it.
01:27:09 I was hoping he'd elaborate, but he didn't.
01:27:11 What is.
01:27:12 I don't need another Colin, buddy.
01:27:14 I'm a little curious.
01:27:15 I'm a little curious.
01:27:16 He says it was a botched circumcision.
01:27:18 Now the dick looks weird.
01:27:19 I kind of want to know why, like what exactly is weird about it?
01:27:24 Well, I'm pretty, pretty against this myself.
01:27:27 This circumcision.
01:27:29 Yeah.
01:27:30 And I think it's, unless you have a really good reason to do it,
01:27:33 it's better not to do it.
01:27:35 People have, people have gotten frustrated with me for being
01:27:38 like ambivalent about it.
01:27:41 But sometimes you got to pick a side, Ben.
01:27:43 I guess I do.
01:27:44 All right.
01:27:45 Because we can't talk about circumcision anymore.
01:27:49 We had to draw a hard line in the same.
01:27:51 You're right.
01:27:52 You're right.
01:27:53 You're right.
01:27:54 I made the rules and I got to stick to them.
01:27:55 Okay.
01:27:56 This one is called on your recording and release schedule.
01:27:59 Three, two, one, go.
01:28:01 Hey.
01:28:02 So last episode, two episodes ago actually at this point,
01:28:07 there were like two, maybe three voicemails that were all like based
01:28:12 on like story of like running storylines and people's characters
01:28:17 who fucked up and weren't up to date on the lore because of how
01:28:27 far apart the podcast is recorded and then released between
01:28:33 like, like that gap to miss out.
01:28:36 I don't know.
01:28:37 Which is a weird thing.
01:28:42 I feel like if you release the podcast a lot sooner,
01:28:45 like maybe like two or three days instead of like five days after.
01:28:50 No.
01:28:51 Okay.
01:28:52 Yeah.
01:28:53 Okay.
01:28:54 That's all right.
01:28:55 Yeah.
01:28:56 Oh, if you just, if you just worked harder, if you just worked your editor
01:28:57 harder, the problem would be solved.
01:28:59 So the podcast was shorter and had less parts moving parts and had fewer
01:29:04 things to edit it.
01:29:05 I don't know.
01:29:06 I don't understand.
01:29:07 It takes days.
01:29:08 Looks like you're getting some.
01:29:09 We don't pay our editor a living wage.
01:29:11 In a, in a, in a perfect world.
01:29:13 Yeah.
01:29:14 The podcast would come out immediately, but it's not going to.
01:29:16 So, you know, you're just going to have to deal with it.
01:29:18 Listen, I would advise, I would advise people that want to make PCP
01:29:23 Canon just sent, just wait until the episode comes out on Friday.
01:29:28 Just send your, just send your voicemail over the weekend.
01:29:31 I don't understand anybody who thinks that their problem with the show
01:29:34 will be solved through a voicemail rather than through sending us money.
01:29:38 Like sending us money is the only way to say you want these to come out
01:29:42 faster, more money.
01:29:44 It's the only way that's going to happen.
01:29:46 You have to agree with that.
01:29:48 If we were making enough money to release this like, remember back in
01:29:52 the pony days when we used to fucking get our videos out within like two
01:29:56 hours of the show airing, we have like a fully edited analysis video,
01:30:00 like two or three hours after the show aired.
01:30:02 Why? Because it made a lot of money.
01:30:04 Because it made the money.
01:30:05 Just put your request on the money itself, write it down on the dollars.
01:30:09 Yes, put the money in the hand and all your dreams will come true.
01:30:14 If enough patrons, if enough patrons unionize and say we will,
01:30:20 we demand, we demand certain things of the show.
01:30:24 I mean, you have power.
01:30:27 You just need to have solidarity.
01:30:29 You just need to have solidarity and wield it against us.
01:30:33 Okay.
01:30:34 The next one is called the Irish samurai.
01:30:37 And there it is.
01:30:38 And three, two, one, go.
01:30:41 Konnichiwa.
01:30:42 This is the Irish samurai.
01:30:44 Oh my God.
01:30:45 I heard from agent E.
01:30:48 A very, very scary, very scary, but very professional lady.
01:30:55 That Benos sent Osan might know something about my fallen brother,
01:31:00 the Kawasaki samurai.
01:31:02 Samurai, Samma.
01:31:03 I heard that he died and that it's your fault that you refused a birthday cake.
01:31:10 And then he killed himself.
01:31:12 This can't be forgiven, Benosan.
01:31:14 I say, if you want to make men's, you should give agent E. your brain.
01:31:20 Yes, I know about that.
01:31:22 She told me that too.
01:31:23 You see, the new podcast ain't out yet, but I heard she told me.
01:31:28 And that's what she wants from you.
01:31:30 She wants your brain.
01:31:31 I know.
01:31:32 I would say give her your brain.
01:31:33 It's the only way to make amends at this point.
01:31:36 You're a fucking idiot if you don't give her your brain.
01:31:39 I'm sorry if this is a little disjointed.
01:31:41 I usually write a script.
01:31:42 Okay, that's it.
01:31:43 Yeah.
01:31:44 No, no, no.
01:31:45 This time.
01:31:46 Good try.
01:31:47 Good try.
01:31:48 I didn't understand any of that.
01:31:49 I mean, you know, that's just an opinion.
01:31:51 It's just an opinion.
01:31:52 But what's your case?
01:31:53 But what's your actual case?
01:31:54 You have no argument.
01:31:55 You have no argument.
01:31:57 That's not an argument.
01:31:58 Not an argument.
01:31:59 Where are the facts and logic?
01:32:00 They're nowhere.
01:32:01 Okay.
01:32:02 Next one is called cross.
01:32:04 Wait, hold on.
01:32:05 Here it is.
01:32:06 It's called cross.
01:32:07 My two cents on no nut November.
01:32:09 Three, two, one, go.
01:32:11 I do know that November partially for the memes, but also because I find that it really helps
01:32:15 my creative motivation.
01:32:17 Like I did it two years ago.
01:32:18 And during those 30 days, my skill at drawing anatomy got noticeably better because my thought
01:32:23 process was like, I'm not going to jack off to porn.
01:32:25 So I guess I'll just draw it.
01:32:27 And then I drew just endless number of tits.
01:32:29 By the way, team mommy milkers for the win.
01:32:32 And then last year, a similar thing happened with my writing ability because I started
01:32:36 writing smut instead of reading it.
01:32:38 And then again, like I noticeably improved.
01:32:40 Plus it's just like a unique experience to have, like to see how you'd react, not masturbating
01:32:46 for the entire month.
01:32:47 And then like if you're successful, it's nice to know that you could like just not like
01:32:53 stop masturbating just like right now.
01:32:55 If you wanted to, not that like masturbating is bad at all though.
01:33:00 I don't know.
01:33:01 Hopefully that makes sense.
01:33:02 I'm really tired.
01:33:03 Sure.
01:33:04 Sure.
01:33:05 I mean, okay.
01:33:06 I totally get that like if you don't, if you're not masturbating, you might be more productive.
01:33:11 That makes perfect sense to me.
01:33:13 What's weird about it is that like.
01:33:16 Why would you then, why would you draw like porn?
01:33:19 Why would you write porn?
01:33:21 Wouldn't, to me like not masturbating would just make me do like, I would do anything but
01:33:27 that.
01:33:28 Yeah, that is pretty weird.
01:33:29 Yeah.
01:33:30 I would think the same.
01:33:31 That would make it worse.
01:33:32 That would make it worse.
01:33:34 That would make no November worse.
01:33:36 It would make it way worse.
01:33:38 I agree.
01:33:39 Yeah.
01:33:40 I don't, that's, I'm like 80% with you, but that last 20% is fucking.
01:33:44 Although at the same time, the hardest part about drawing porn is that you, you know,
01:33:49 get too horny and have to go jack off.
01:33:51 So maybe if you can't, then it makes it easier.
01:33:55 I don't, I don't draw porn.
01:33:56 So I don't really know.
01:33:57 But like most of like the porn artists that I like follow on the internet, I, most of
01:34:04 them seem to say that they don't, they don't jack off to their own shit, which is like.
01:34:10 Self control.
01:34:11 Which is weird to me.
01:34:12 Self control, I guess.
01:34:13 Because it's hot.
01:34:14 And I, because it's stuff I think is hot.
01:34:15 And I'm like, man, I bet they're fucking jacking it because I sure am.
01:34:18 But they're like, nah, they're like, nah.
01:34:20 I mean, maybe you have to have that.
01:34:22 This is, this is just a paycheck for me.
01:34:24 Maybe you have to have that to be able to draw porn.
01:34:27 Maybe you do.
01:34:28 Maybe you do.
01:34:30 All right.
01:34:32 Okay.
01:34:34 The next one is, wait, did we just listen to this one?
01:34:39 I'm lost.
01:34:40 Okay.
01:34:42 This one is called fraud is real.
01:34:47 Okay.
01:34:48 Three, two, one, go.
01:34:51 Wikipedia changed the definition of president elect.
01:34:57 Yeah.
01:34:58 They changed it.
01:34:59 Before it said something like, oh, the president select elect isn't selected.
01:35:04 If it's disputed, you know, they're not like considered the president elect, but they
01:35:08 changed it.
01:35:09 They removed that line.
01:35:12 Weird.
01:35:13 Weird.
01:35:14 A lot of voter fraud stuff.
01:35:16 I mean, I don't care what we're doing.
01:35:18 We don't care anymore.
01:35:19 Can we move on to the next one?
01:35:21 Yeah, this guy, honestly, this guy sucks.
01:35:23 Boring.
01:35:24 This guy, this guy used to be funny, but now he just like makes these like, unironic,
01:35:29 like, he's like, unironic.
01:35:31 What's the word?
01:35:32 Political.
01:35:33 Like, yeah, like, like right wing, like political diatribe voicemails and like, it's pretty,
01:35:38 it's pretty tedious, honestly.
01:35:40 Next.
01:35:41 Next one is, it all comes full circle.
01:35:46 There.
01:35:47 Three, two, one, go.
01:35:50 I used to watch TVP that stopped because I lost interest in ponies.
01:35:55 I then independently discovered best guy over in Ben St.
01:35:58 And only after getting into the PCP did I realize that they were TVP.
01:36:03 Pretty wild.
01:36:04 That'd be like if I didn't know give and take and hypocrite were the same person.
01:36:09 That's happened.
01:36:10 That's what happened to me initially.
01:36:12 Yeah.
01:36:13 I mean, that's like talking about that.
01:36:15 Wait, wait, that's not, wait, sorry.
01:36:18 Did I miss it?
01:36:19 Did you say that you felt that you watched TVP?
01:36:21 No, he did not know that hippo and given were the same person.
01:36:26 Oh, okay.
01:36:27 Okay.
01:36:28 Did you watch TVP?
01:36:29 That would be fucking crazy.
01:36:32 That's funny.
01:36:33 That's a weird comparison.
01:36:34 If I was going to say, I would make the comparison.
01:36:36 I would be like, that would be like if I was watching Game Grumps and I didn't realize that
01:36:40 Aaron was the, was the sequelitis guy or something.
01:36:45 I don't know.
01:36:46 It's, it's funny to use, it's funny to use like hippo for that.
01:36:50 I did it again.
01:36:51 To use Gib for that.
01:36:52 Cause like, I don't know.
01:36:53 Gib is, Gib is as small and insignificant as the rest of us.
01:36:58 Well, on a small side note, I didn't actually mention this last time, but the early Game
01:37:07 Grumps with John are huge inspiration to my channel actually.
01:37:12 I mean, same to this whole podcast for sure.
01:37:17 I liked, I liked, yeah, I liked, I liked the John episodes.
01:37:22 I liked the, I liked the, I liked the early Danny episodes.
01:37:25 I don't listen to them anymore.
01:37:27 I don't like John anymore.
01:37:28 I think John Tron is a fucking asshole.
01:37:30 I haven't listened to them in a while either, but I think the John episodes are still pretty good.
01:37:36 I actually still go back to them for inspiration.
01:37:39 I believe that.
01:37:40 I believe it.
01:37:41 I haven't watched, I don't know.
01:37:43 I like, I like try, I had a, I had a period where I binged Game Grumps for a while.
01:37:48 It was, I was pretty, it was a time I was pretty depressed.
01:37:53 Probably, probably the second most depressed I've ever been in my life.
01:37:57 Second only two right now.
01:37:59 And it was, it was a dark time.
01:38:02 So I think it kind of makes me like not want to revisit that.
01:38:04 Are you the most depressed you've ever been in your life right now, Ben?
01:38:08 Yeah, probably.
01:38:09 Yeah, probably getting there.
01:38:11 You don't seem, you don't seem the most depressed I've ever seen you.
01:38:15 Is, is, have you, have you seen, have you seen me more depressed?
01:38:19 Like visibly, like noticeably?
01:38:21 Well, I don't see you lately.
01:38:23 So maybe that's, maybe that's part of the problem.
01:38:25 I don't know what you physically look like.
01:38:27 I don't know, I thought every year, doesn't it make sense every year would be the most
01:38:32 depressing year of your life because you're older?
01:38:35 I don't.
01:38:37 It wasn't working that way for me.
01:38:39 My adulthood has been better than my teen years.
01:38:42 So for a long time, I felt like every year was getting better.
01:38:46 I mean, I actually, I mean, I look, I look fine.
01:38:49 I look, I look fantastic.
01:38:50 I posted a selfie on Twitter today and there's everybody, everybody loves me.
01:38:54 I'm lifting again.
01:38:56 I'm lifting again.
01:38:57 That's pretty good.
01:38:58 But on the inside, I'm crying.
01:39:00 2020 is definitely worse in every conceivable way than 2019 for me, which is probably true
01:39:06 for almost everybody on planet Earth.
01:39:08 But I feel like I did not get it as bad as most people did.
01:39:12 Like for, for most of the coronavirus going on, I was feeling like, wow, I feel like this
01:39:18 has had less of an effect on me than almost anybody else.
01:39:21 Eventually the effects, you know, the, just the long-term effects of the entire world
01:39:26 being shit for like months started to finally take its toll.
01:39:30 But, you know, I'm hopeful for the future.
01:39:34 I feel like, I don't feel like I got, I do.
01:39:37 I feel similarly in that coronavirus directly affected me less than most people.
01:39:43 So, but it, but I feel worse in a way because I feel like I personally failed to use the
01:39:52 coronavirus time effectively.
01:39:54 I feel like I fucking fucked it up and squandered it.
01:39:59 I don't think there was anything you could do.
01:40:01 I think, I think we were all fucked.
01:40:04 I could, okay.
01:40:05 I just think I could have done a lot more with the time.
01:40:08 I feel like I could have, I could have gotten my shit done a lot faster and I could have
01:40:12 been doing other stuff.
01:40:13 I could have, it makes, I feel like I could have been streaming these past several months
01:40:17 and it probably would have been a good time to do so.
01:40:19 I just, nobody has any money to give you.
01:40:21 Like everybody's fucking broke.
01:40:23 The world is fucking broke.
01:40:25 Like we're, people aren't even working.
01:40:26 Well, it's not much longer.
01:40:27 This is going to last.
01:40:28 So you might still have plenty of time.
01:40:30 Yeah.
01:40:31 I guess you're right.
01:40:32 I guess like, you know, it's true.
01:40:33 I could, I could, I could try and turn it around at any time, but like, I mean, I probably
01:40:40 just should try to do that.
01:40:42 Yeah.
01:40:43 Well, let's listen to the next voice mail.
01:40:45 Yeah.
01:40:46 Move on with our own lives.
01:40:47 Next one is Agent E. Three, two, one, go.
01:40:52 Konnichiwa.
01:40:53 Oh no.
01:40:54 Benosento san.
01:40:55 Sorry.
01:40:56 It's more lore.
01:40:57 This is Agent E. I heard that you were contacted by my, we'll say colleagues.
01:41:04 Irish Samurai, yes.
01:41:05 The Irish Samurai.
01:41:06 True.
01:41:07 As you can no doubt tell, there are many moving pieces in this story.
01:41:11 There's too many, Frank.
01:41:12 And it is your story, Ben.
01:41:14 And so you must decide, are you what's protagonist or it's antagonist?
01:41:20 Will you do what is right?
01:41:22 No.

01:46:56 Oh, God, I'm one of them three two one go
01:47:00 Hey, just have a simple question of any of you ever write a book called the intergame of tennis
01:47:04 It's about how to approve of things and it's pretty good cause you touched on some of the ideas
01:47:07 I highly recommend it if you have read it, and if you have what are your takes after reading it?
01:47:12 I literally got better at everything I did and it's literally great
01:47:15 I'm a missionary in Africa building churches instead of giving you food
01:47:19 Die anyway. Oh God, I just I'm the one leaving the city voice mouth now
01:47:23 So my only choice is to wrap a sheet around my neck with Jeffrey Epstein myself looking lean forward at produce 500 pounds of pressure
01:47:31 Just by leaning forward really fast and ending my life. So I'm gonna do that now
01:47:35 That's the that's that's the trick. Um, I feel like there's two types of PCP voice mailers
01:47:41 There's like the the ones who like do like the three types
01:47:45 There's the ones who do a character the ones who sound like they're drunk and the ones who sound like munchie
01:47:52 Was which one was that was a munchie one just like the non
01:47:57 They're trying to cram everything into one complete sentence 136 second burst of words and energy
01:48:04 She she she she she really tries to keep hers concise and it's and I appreciate it as well
01:48:10 I mean the munchie like ones are the best ones because they talk fast
01:48:14 You know what that value that thanks for valuing. Thanks for valuing our time
01:48:20 But I have not read the inner art of tennis. Is that what it was called?
01:48:25 But I'm glad that it made you have a rather other

01:49:35 The upsides are negligible the downsides are negligible. It's not really doesn't matter
01:49:40 I don't understand like so many people have such strong feelings about this. Okay. Yes. I agree
01:49:45 Wait, what do you mean? It's not now for me the downsides are negligible if they fuck it up
01:49:49 I probably want to get my kids circumcised. Oh
01:49:51 Yeah, if they bought this procedure and like it's just a weird cultural thing that owned by states in like a handful of
01:49:59 That being said, okay, yeah, yeah, we've been over no long time
01:50:03 Um, I don't understand why people feel the need to throw in their two cents and then say the same thing that everyone else already said
01:50:09 I
01:50:11 I agree like like the first couple weeks. I attributed it to like
01:50:16 To it's the same as the last guy
01:50:19 The first couple the first couple weeks
01:50:20 I attributed it to people not having heard the latest episode because they hadn't come out
01:50:24 But now it's been like five fucking weeks and like you should know better
01:50:28 You should really know better than to send another voicemail about circumcision

01:59:34 go Mr. censorship.
01:59:36 Okay, oh god, last voicemail is called,
01:59:40 I win the circumcision debate, so everyone shut the fuck up.
01:59:44 We'll see about that, three, two, one, go.
01:59:48 Long ago, I gave birth to a baby boy of my own.
01:59:51 I didn't think about getting him circumcised,
01:59:53 but the psychotic doctors insisted
01:59:55 that they cut up his little peewee hermon.
01:59:58 I wasn't comfortable with it, but the doctor said,
02:00:00 he must lose his force gate.
02:00:02 It's the only way he survives.
02:00:04 It's true.
02:00:05 My precious baby boy stopped sucking
02:00:07 on my fat, milky, motherly titties,
02:00:10 looked the doctor straight in the eye and said,
02:00:12 doctor, I don't want to be circumcised.
02:00:14 Studies have shown that there is little no improvement
02:00:16 in a boy's health due to circumcision.
02:00:17 This is practically child mutilation and nothing more.
02:00:19 Please doctor, don't take my foreskin away.
02:00:22 All the doctors in the room clapped
02:00:24 and I was moved to tears.
02:00:26 My son was not circumcised
02:00:28 and then he lived a happy, healthy life.
02:00:31 And that boy's name was Joe Biden.
02:00:36 No!
02:00:39 USA.
02:00:40 I thought it was a wholesome story that it turned out
02:00:42 to be a story about a child rapist.
