00:00:00 How do you like that?
00:00:05 Left out in the cold.
00:00:12 Everyone's man and murder face.
00:00:14 Everyone's speaking mean to me.
00:00:17 Nobody gets re-residuals.
00:00:21 Dick individuals.
00:00:23 Fuck those six-wise fantasy.
00:00:25 I'm the fucking foundation of this five piece.
00:00:28 I lay down my soul. I lay down my heart.
00:00:31 But they try to tear me apart.
00:00:34 Nothing in this world is where the work is for.
00:00:37 If they don't come, maybe they'll show us what's important.
00:00:40 You better tear it up or they'll show us what's better.
00:00:43 I ain't breaking a sweat cause it don't really matter.
00:00:45 Nothing in this world shouldn't not be easy.
00:00:48 If it needs my comfort, tell them it won't make me queen.
00:00:51 Do you know what I ain't gonna do?
00:00:52 I'll give up room, I'll break up.
00:00:54 Why is something so hard?
00:00:57 Why can't everything be easy?
00:01:02 Why can't it be easy, man?
00:01:04 Man, even singing the song is hard.
00:01:07 It gotta make everything hard.
00:01:09 I should hire someone to sing this song.
00:01:12 That would be easy.
00:01:13 Then I'd have to tell them how to sing it.
00:01:15 Then I'd have to pay them or I'd really get some money.
00:01:18 See, everything leads into everything else in the bass.
00:01:21 It's so hard, man.
00:01:23 That's why people kill themselves.
00:01:26 Hello, everybody.
00:01:28 Welcome to the new PCP part one of this episode.
00:01:33 That's right.
00:01:34 This is just me and Hippo over here.
00:01:36 Say hi, Hippo.
00:01:37 Hi, Hippo.
00:01:40 Anyway, this is just us because it's only part one.
00:01:46 We decided to begin the recording and no one else wanted to show up.
00:01:51 We were like, you know, every goddamn week.
00:01:55 It is like an hour of waiting for people to show up.
00:01:58 Sometimes I'm the one who takes an hour to show up.
00:02:00 But sometimes it's been, sometimes it's always someone.
00:02:03 It's just so hard.
00:02:05 Getting the podcast to start is very difficult.
00:02:08 It's an all day process sometimes.
00:02:10 Yeah, and that is the topic of this podcast.
00:02:13 Things being really hard and it's annoying and we hate it.
00:02:16 Right.
00:02:17 Now, I guess I'll just come right out of the gate with saying,
00:02:19 come up with inventive solutions to your problems,
00:02:22 which is exactly what we've done here.
00:02:24 Because me and Hippo, I guess we're just right in the mood to begin recording right now.
00:02:28 And we decided, hey, let's just talk about it ourselves.
00:02:30 Then once we've set our piece, however long it takes to do so,
00:02:33 then we'll turn it off and just put our recording set aside.
00:02:36 Then other people can show up and record amongst themselves.
00:02:39 They can say their things.
00:02:40 And then over the course of this PCP episode,
00:02:43 everyone can have said exactly what they wanted to say,
00:02:46 but without a six way clusterfuck of chat client monstrosity.
00:02:50 That is really annoying to hear anyway.
00:02:52 So I think this is a new format, a new exciting format
00:02:55 that should really evolve the PCP into a new light direction.
00:03:01 So, yeah.
00:03:03 The reason this whole thing has come to pass in this particular way is because
00:03:09 there's time zone kerfuffle that the podcast was supposed to start at 3 p.m.
00:03:15 Eastern Standard Time.
00:03:16 According to Google, I typed in my time
00:03:20 and it came up with, it was 7 p.m.
00:03:23 That was for me when we're, you know, 3 p.m.
00:03:26 So then time zones are annoying.
00:03:29 And then I said, okay, it's time to start.
00:03:31 And everyone's like, we got a whole hour to go.
00:03:34 We're not ready.
00:03:35 And so I just jumped in.
00:03:36 I didn't give a shit.
00:03:37 You know, I think in this day and age of the internet,
00:03:41 like retroactively, if you could make it to our time zones,
00:03:45 it weren't a thing that would probably be a good idea.
00:03:47 Like, you know, there would just be certain parts of the world
00:03:50 where the times of which you get up and go to bed are completely different,
00:03:53 but that would be like way more easy to adjust for, you know?
00:03:56 Like, instead of saying, like, talk into a guy from Britain
00:03:59 and being like, having to have all this confusion about what time it is,
00:04:02 you can simply have a funny conversation about how you go to bed at 2 p.m.
00:04:06 You wake up at 3 a.m.
00:04:08 That's so funny.
00:04:09 But at least all of your appointments can be on time without any complications, you know?
00:04:13 Yeah.
00:04:14 I mean, changing your watch when you land in a plane in a new country
00:04:19 isn't so bad because they usually tell you what time it is.
00:04:21 But like, doing stuff online across the globe,
00:04:25 especially at a time like this where I think the clocks are supposed to go back
00:04:29 an hour or forward an hour depending on where you live,
00:04:32 it's gay.
00:04:34 I hate time.
00:04:35 Time sucks.
00:04:36 You know, that is sort of many reasons why stuff is so hard.
00:04:38 You get into a fundamental issue.
00:04:39 Certainly things among human society is the different layers of civilization
00:04:44 that have to be built on top of one another.
00:04:46 Like, all of technology that we have right now,
00:04:49 all the digital technology that we have,
00:04:51 has to be regulated through laws that were sometimes written 200 years ago,
00:04:55 and things get really blurry in terms of the interpretation, don't you know?
00:04:59 You know, you got like, computers themselves,
00:05:02 which were designed for DOS in the mid-80s,
00:05:05 and they still are fundamentally the same.
00:05:08 I'm not exactly sure about the technicals of this,
00:05:11 but basically the way that computers are now is fundamentally the same
00:05:15 that they were like 30 years ago,
00:05:17 like before the internet was even out,
00:05:19 and so you're just building all this shit into these old systems.
00:05:23 It's like physical tradition.
00:05:26 Right.
00:05:27 And like how, I know that your city of London and stuff
00:05:31 is like laid out in a way that was originally designed for horses, right?
00:05:36 Yeah, I mean, the whole of Britain has got like a lot of winding country roads
00:05:40 and small alleyways and, you know, suburbs.
00:05:44 They're not like grids.
00:05:45 If you ever go on Google Maps and you look around England,
00:05:48 you see the suburbs are like winding roads and going up hills and down hills,
00:05:52 and it's all because they branch off of main roads
00:05:55 that horses use to travel between cities.
00:05:57 Right.
00:05:58 It all starts from a way,
00:06:00 and the difference with America is that they had the technology to plan it out
00:06:05 so that it can make it all efficient with grids and stuff.
00:06:08 Yeah.
00:06:09 I remember you once saying that like when you were like seeing some footage
00:06:11 replaying Grand Theft Auto,
00:06:13 you thought that the cities were laid out that way
00:06:15 because it would be easier to design for a level,
00:06:17 but then you found out that it was just America.
00:06:19 Yeah, I had no idea.
00:06:21 Then you got like modern ass cities like Dubai,
00:06:24 which are designed to be like 21st century from the ground up.
00:06:28 Be like, hey, let's make a really cool looking skyscraper out of nowhere.
00:06:31 Let's just build it.
00:06:32 Although, incidentally, Dubai has its own issues by being in the middle of the desert.
00:06:35 They don't have a central sewage system.
00:06:38 Every building in Dubai has a poop room,
00:06:41 and a poop truck has to come and suck up the poop
00:06:44 and then get up and then get the fuck out of that city,
00:06:47 and sometimes they get backed up in traffic.
00:06:50 Yeah.
00:06:51 That sounds like one of the things,
00:06:53 one of the jokes my dad used to tell me,
00:06:55 or told me at one point in my childhood,
00:06:57 and I just believed because I didn't know any better.
00:07:00 He said that when you flush the toilet,
00:07:02 it goes into a truck and a guy comes and scoops it out
00:07:05 and then drives it into the sea.
00:07:07 I was like, oh.
00:07:08 And then there was one time where the sewage actually got blocked
00:07:12 and they had some guys around.
00:07:13 And I asked dad, is that the poop truck?
00:07:15 And then they laughed.
00:07:16 I was like, that's not real.
00:07:17 I didn't know.
00:07:18 Yeah, my dad was like that too.
00:07:20 That's another reason why stuff gets hard.
00:07:22 When your dads are fucking around with you,
00:07:24 you have no idea when they're being serious.
00:07:26 I remember my dad would just make up things
00:07:30 that aren't real just to be funny.
00:07:32 And it got to the point that I wouldn't believe him,
00:07:34 even when he's saying stuff that is legitimate.
00:07:36 Like, hey, David, you're like roller coaster tycoon.
00:07:38 You should play zoo tycoon and mall tycoon.
00:07:41 I'm like, I just thought he made those up.
00:07:43 I didn't realize there were other tycoon games.
00:07:45 I totally didn't believe him.
00:07:47 So that's why things get hard.
00:07:48 Dad's trying to be funny and just by lying.
00:07:52 I think we should clarify what we're really talking about
00:07:56 when we're talking about hard.
00:07:58 Because things being hard is quite a vague, big topic.
00:08:02 Really what we're talking about is frustratingly complicated.
00:08:07 And stuff that just makes your blood boil in some way.
00:08:12 I mean, maybe not blood boil.
00:08:14 For me, it's always blood boil.
00:08:17 It's frustration at the way things are
00:08:20 and why can't they just be different.
00:08:23 Because we've thought of better ideas since...
00:08:25 Here's the difference between all technology
00:08:28 for most of human history versus technology
00:08:31 since the advent of computers.
00:08:33 Before computers, it's like having a piece of bread
00:08:39 with some butter and some brown sugar on top.
00:08:42 Very bland.
00:08:44 The age of computers is like being given a cinnamon roll
00:08:48 with caramel on top and chocolate and chocolate chips.
00:08:52 But there's a guy constantly causing you to dodge the cinnamon roll.
00:08:58 Like you just want to have that cinnamon roll.
00:09:00 You get the fork.
00:09:01 You plant the fork down.
00:09:03 You plant the fork down on the plate.
00:09:05 But then a dude grabs the plate
00:09:07 and causes your fork to miss the cinnamon roll.
00:09:10 So then you realign, you go for another stab
00:09:13 trying to get your fork in the cinnamon roll.
00:09:15 And the dude just keeps moving the plate around.
00:09:17 And then you try to get a little bit of it
00:09:19 but then he grabs it off your fork.
00:09:21 And then you try to put some cinnamon roll in your mouth
00:09:23 and he grabs it out of your mouth.
00:09:25 And then if you do the wrong thing,
00:09:26 he'll flip the cinnamon roll on the freaking floor
00:09:29 and you got to take it to a repair store to get it fixed
00:09:32 just so you can try and get another cinnamon roll.
00:09:34 That's what the modern age is like.
00:09:36 You are promised more incredible luxury
00:09:39 and incredible inventions
00:09:40 than you've ever been able to conceive of before.
00:09:42 But the actual getting of it
00:09:44 is just several orders of magnitude
00:09:46 more complicated and ridiculous
00:09:48 than anything we can comprehend.
00:09:50 People have often feared the day
00:09:52 when computers could take over humanity
00:09:54 but I think that they basically already have
00:09:56 because they are essentially their own organism.
00:09:59 They are a new branch of life
00:10:01 separate from humans and animals and fungi
00:10:03 that have been created by humans
00:10:05 but are already out of our control.
00:10:07 I remember when the Wi-Fi in my house didn't work one time,
00:10:09 a technician came over to fix it.
00:10:11 He didn't know what was happening.
00:10:12 He didn't know how to fix it
00:10:13 so a senior technician came over to fix it
00:10:15 and he didn't know how to fix it.
00:10:17 How is something that humans made
00:10:19 beyond the reach of humans to comprehend?
00:10:22 That is the world that we are living in today.
00:10:25 Hippo, what do you have to say?
00:10:28 Well, I've got to say I like the cinnamon roll imagery.
00:10:32 I wasn't really sure where you were going with that
00:10:35 but now I understand that it's the complicatedness
00:10:38 of technology that's...
00:10:40 You've got a 500 terabyte hard drive
00:10:44 in the palm of your hand
00:10:46 but you can't get anything on it.
00:10:48 You can't plug it in.
00:10:50 I don't know how to explain it
00:10:53 but you explained it pretty well.
00:10:55 It's easier than it would have otherwise been
00:10:59 but it's still hard.
00:11:01 I think that ties into people in first world countries
00:11:05 still being able to be depressed
00:11:07 even though they don't have it as hard as other people.
00:11:09 It's basically like that, you know?
00:11:11 It doesn't matter how good your life is.
00:11:13 Everything sucks.
00:11:15 Well, something sucks.
00:11:16 It's like what James Rolfe says about DVDs.
00:11:18 He's like, you know, they are better than VHS
00:11:21 but they're more bullshit-y than VHS.
00:11:23 They do a better job but they have way more problems.
00:11:27 And that's what all of technology is basically like.
00:11:31 Whoa, the hell's going on with your mic?
00:11:33 I don't know.
00:11:34 It sounds like bubbling.
00:11:36 Like a fan is slapping something really fast.
00:11:39 Am I still doing that?
00:11:41 Yeah.
00:11:43 It's like a really slow B
00:11:45 and it's caught in a plastic tube.
00:11:49 Is it still happening?
00:11:51 No, it's gone.
00:11:52 I was seeing it on the wave form of my audacity.
00:11:56 I can't wait to...
00:11:58 I think that might just be a loose connection
00:12:00 on your mic or something.
00:12:03 See how hard things are?
00:12:05 He has no idea what's wrong.
00:12:07 It's so easy to relate this to everything that happens in life.
00:12:10 I feel like also on a fundamental level
00:12:13 things are hard because of the basic logic of entropy.
00:12:17 Minute physics is having this series of videos
00:12:20 produced by some entropy specialist guy
00:12:23 and he's explaining the laws of entropy
00:12:26 and how they control all of the universe
00:12:29 and how the universe started off as one condensed ball of energy
00:12:33 and eventually become a bunch of nothingness.
00:12:37 And the only reason that life and even time can occur
00:12:40 is because of all the conflict and shlubla-boobling
00:12:43 that happens in between.
00:12:45 The process from getting to pure energy to pure nothingness
00:12:48 that is where stuff comes from, you know?
00:12:52 It's from the conflict of things happening
00:12:57 that stuff could even happen in the first place.
00:13:00 And that is why things are hard
00:13:02 because of entropy.
00:13:06 Were you actually...
00:13:07 Was that actually a point?
00:13:09 Because I didn't get it.
00:13:10 I don't know, it's up for you to decide.
00:13:12 Oh, okay.
00:13:14 It's hard for me to comprehend that's what it is.
00:13:16 You know, it's kind of weird.
00:13:18 The reason I jumped on this podcast so quickly
00:13:20 is because I was actually in a really good feeling productive mood
00:13:23 so maybe I'm not in the best state of mind
00:13:25 to talk about things being hard.
00:13:27 I don't know, but yeah.
00:13:30 Really, we could jump into the part two of this podcast
00:13:33 where naturally everyone's here.
00:13:35 And this could be like the intro.
00:13:37 Yeah, the intro.
00:13:39 The really long weird intro.
00:13:41 I want to talk directly to you, Hippo.
00:13:43 What are some things in your life that are hard?
00:13:45 I mean, you're trying to start YouTube videos
00:13:48 and getting those popular and you're not making
00:13:50 that much progress very quickly.
00:13:52 That's stupid and gay and that's what YouTube is like.
00:13:54 Talk about that some.
00:13:56 Okay, well, it's hard to get momentum, I suppose.
00:14:02 I mean, even Jon Tron probably wouldn't have gotten
00:14:05 as big as he did if he didn't blow up on Reddit
00:14:07 and then went to Game Grumps.
00:14:09 You know, even someone as funny as that
00:14:13 had to get a big boost out of nowhere.
00:14:15 And I don't think I'm going to get to that size
00:14:18 unless I latch onto one of those big guys
00:14:21 or get blown up on Reddit
00:14:23 or something big happens.
00:14:25 Like, I get a really good video.
00:14:27 But for now, all I can do is just keep going
00:14:30 and, you know, it's fun.
00:14:32 I make enough Patreon to pay rent, so I'm not too worried.
00:14:35 You do? Whoa, that's cool.
00:14:37 Well, it's because I live with my parents at the moment
00:14:40 and they're very nice, so the rent's very reasonable.
00:14:44 That's pretty cool.
00:14:45 You know, like, toward the end of me
00:14:48 trying to make my own channel my full-time thing,
00:14:51 you know, bounce between whether or not it should be
00:14:53 or whether or not I should do the Digibro editing.
00:14:55 Like, the last plan I had in mind
00:14:58 and, like, I was like, if this plan doesn't work at all
00:15:00 then I give up is I'm just going to, like,
00:15:03 make videos collaboratively with other channels
00:15:06 that are big.
00:15:07 Like, I'll literally just message other channels
00:15:09 that are slightly bigger than me
00:15:11 or at least have more fans than me, you know,
00:15:13 and be like, hey, I would like to just straight up
00:15:15 make an entire video and it goes up on your channel.
00:15:18 Like, I just do the whole thing from start to finish.
00:15:20 I figure a lot of channels would be okay
00:15:22 with that having a free video on their channel
00:15:24 that they get to make ad revenue off of
00:15:26 but then it gives exposure.txt for me.
00:15:29 You know, that was all I could think of at that point.
00:15:31 So you just actually go for the whole exposure thing.
00:15:34 Yeah, because I didn't know what else to do.
00:15:36 It was getting hard, man.
00:15:38 Yeah, well, I liked your videos.
00:15:40 I still kind of wish you were still doing your own stuff.
00:15:43 Yes.
00:15:44 The Prince of Persia one was, like,
00:15:46 I think the last one I remember watching.
00:15:49 Yes.
00:15:50 I want to see more of those game things.
00:15:52 Me too.
00:15:54 Yeah, another thing being hard,
00:15:56 having more things to do in your life
00:15:59 than you have life for.
00:16:02 Yeah, that's another issue.
00:16:04 I think we all know that sort of feeling of...
00:16:08 Yeah.
00:16:09 There's not enough time in a day to get multiple things done.
00:16:12 You have to just stick with one,
00:16:14 otherwise you'll get nothing.
00:16:16 Right.
00:16:17 You'll get nothing done.
00:16:20 One thing I have very specific trouble with is writing.
00:16:24 I spend, like, a month or two months writing a script,
00:16:28 two days editing, two days recording all the audio.
00:16:32 Oh, recording audio.
00:16:34 And then one week or maybe less than a week to edit it.
00:16:37 Probably a month to edit it, actually.
00:16:39 But the writing takes a demonstrably large amount of time
00:16:42 compared to someone like Digi, who just thinks of it,
00:16:45 writes it down, and then that's it.
00:16:47 Yeah.
00:16:48 It's too quick for me.
00:16:50 I don't think he goes quite as fast as he sometimes indicates
00:16:53 that he does, or at least lately.
00:16:55 I think he maybe puts more polishing time into stuff,
00:16:58 or maybe he...
00:16:59 I think it's more like he stews on it,
00:17:01 writes a paragraph, stews or something.
00:17:03 I don't know.
00:17:04 I actually have not watched him writing,
00:17:07 but I think that's what it's like.
00:17:09 Anyway.
00:17:10 You should put a secret camera in his room.
00:17:12 Yeah.
00:17:13 Oh, man.
00:17:14 Yeah.
00:17:15 Make that...
00:17:16 Put that on Davoo.
00:17:17 It goes to Saturn.
00:17:18 Make that a...
00:17:19 Make that a Patreon reward here.
00:17:20 It's access to the 24-7 DigiCam.
00:17:23 So, uh, Mages here now.
00:17:25 Say hi.
00:17:26 Hi.
00:17:27 Okay, cool.
00:17:28 So, we were talking about why things are so hard,
00:17:31 and we were specifically talking about the production
00:17:33 of video making, how Hippo in particular,
00:17:36 you seem to have a huge problem with writing.
00:17:38 Like, it's just kind of hard to do.
00:17:40 Yeah.
00:17:41 I don't know what it is.
00:17:43 I think it's just...
00:17:44 I like working in a straight line,
00:17:47 like chronologically.
00:17:48 I go through the thing.
00:17:49 I don't like skipping a part
00:17:51 that I'm having trouble with
00:17:52 and coming back to it later.
00:17:54 I don't do that either, really.
00:17:56 It's like, if I can't think of a good way
00:17:58 to flow from this paragraph to that point
00:18:01 in a way that's either funny or interesting or good,
00:18:05 then I get stuck on it for hours,
00:18:07 and I tab over to anything else
00:18:09 to distract myself from the fact
00:18:10 that I can't figure out what I'm doing.
00:18:12 And that just goes on for weeks and months,
00:18:14 and I hate it.
00:18:16 And you say you've spent like two days
00:18:18 doing the voiceover as well?
00:18:20 Well, yeah, I mean, I did the Rayman
00:18:23 I'm working on at the moment,
00:18:25 and I finally finished that script,
00:18:26 and then in one day afterwards,
00:18:28 I recorded the whole thing.
00:18:30 Brilliant.
00:18:31 I've still got to do the live-action stuff,
00:18:33 but I sat down and I just...
00:18:35 I spoke...
00:18:36 It was actually the best voiceover recording session
00:18:40 I've ever had, so that was good.
00:18:42 Not really, you know?
00:18:43 I only just, like, now got comfortable
00:18:47 with reading scripts,
00:18:49 like, almost comfortable, at least.
00:18:52 I still have not really had an occasion
00:18:54 where I have a whole thing,
00:18:56 and I record it, and it comes out ideally
00:18:59 on the first try,
00:19:01 but I'm at least now able to, like,
00:19:03 read something short on the third attempt,
00:19:06 and it comes out well,
00:19:07 and I don't feel too stressed out about it, you know?
00:19:09 I don't know how many people have watched
00:19:11 a lot of my older, like, 2014 videos
00:19:13 where my voice sounds way different
00:19:15 and sounds like I'm choking on a big, fat dick,
00:19:18 and it was the most annoying thing ever.
00:19:20 It was stressing the fuck out of me.
00:19:22 I mean, I had my braces removed,
00:19:24 like, five or six videos into my full-time YouTubing,
00:19:28 so that, like, screwed up my ability
00:19:30 to speak clearly in a comfortable manner,
00:19:33 trying to strike a balance between
00:19:35 sounding comfortable and sounding...
00:19:37 like, sounding natural and, like,
00:19:39 annunciating all of your syllables
00:19:41 is a dichotomy that you sometimes have to, like,
00:19:45 teeter on and make sacrifices and trade-offs in.
00:19:49 And, uh, gosh, yeah,
00:19:51 I feel like most people either start off terrible
00:19:55 and never improve that much with voiceover
00:19:58 or start off pretty good and get a lot better.
00:20:01 I feel like there's only some people
00:20:03 with an excessive amount of determination
00:20:05 who start off bad, like me,
00:20:08 and then get pretty good, as I would now say I am.
00:20:12 Yeah, uh...
00:20:13 I do like your voice in your...
00:20:17 in the way you explain things, especially the annunciation,
00:20:20 like, making the syllables deliberate.
00:20:23 It's different from just chatting with somebody,
00:20:25 because even across the room, they can tell what you're saying,
00:20:28 but a microphone has bad hearing.
00:20:30 It needs a lot of...
00:20:32 you need to be right up close to it
00:20:34 and to make sure you say everything correctly.
00:20:37 Otherwise, it won't know what to tell a computer.
00:20:40 Yeah.
00:20:41 Yeah, and you have to make sure you don't make weird noises.
00:20:44 Like, with the clicking of the tongue,
00:20:46 sometimes some people find it really annoying and gross.
00:20:50 Yeah, so...
00:20:51 What do you mean?
00:20:53 No, not that sort of thing, but it's just like...
00:20:55 I can't even describe it, but some people see that.
00:20:58 It's the little lip smack when you open your mouth
00:21:00 after a period of time.
00:21:02 Yeah, it's also weird and gross.
00:21:05 I don't like it.
00:21:10 I try to cut out those out from my audio,
00:21:14 which makes audio editing a lot more annoying for me,
00:21:17 because I usually do that, so I have to...
00:21:21 Especially since my voice is so quiet,
00:21:25 you can't really mask it with background music,
00:21:28 because the whole volume level of everything
00:21:31 is kind of small, so if I make it louder,
00:21:34 you can hear the lip smacks even more,
00:21:35 so I have to cut them out.
00:21:37 Yeah, and I have to also cut out by my inhales and exhales.
00:21:41 Apparently, they're quite loud.
00:21:44 No one knows, though, because I edit them out.
00:21:47 It's really annoying, because I breathe all the time,
00:21:51 so that's a lot of editing.
00:21:54 Whoa!
00:21:56 Who knew?
00:21:58 Specifically, people with small voices
00:22:02 at audio editing is really hard,
00:22:05 because if you're loud,
00:22:07 if you're like Nate, you can go,
00:22:09 whaa!
00:22:11 And then when you look at noise removal
00:22:14 and making it sound good,
00:22:16 you really don't need to do much,
00:22:18 because if you've got a voice like mine,
00:22:20 even when I'm trying really hard to make it sound loud,
00:22:24 there's a lot of noise that gets picked up in the background
00:22:27 because the microphone's gain is turned up
00:22:29 so that they can hear me,
00:22:31 so there's extra problems
00:22:33 if you're not shouting all the time.
00:22:35 I feel you.
00:22:37 Smee and Gib, Small Voice Club.
00:22:39 Yeah.
00:22:41 Well, I'm just in too positive of a mood
00:22:44 to go on for very long about things being hard.
00:22:47 I don't know, I'm just not really into it at the moment.
00:22:51 Are you thinking it's quite hard
00:22:53 to think of things to talk about in this podcast?
00:22:56 I mean, talking specifically about video-making
00:23:01 or just things that you're trying to...
00:23:03 We were talking about anything.
00:23:05 Anything.
00:23:06 So if there's things that make life hard,
00:23:08 what are you doing in your life, Mage?
00:23:11 Oh, I want to make...
00:23:13 I've been working on a comic sort of
00:23:15 kind of like on six or seven pages now
00:23:17 and just everything.
00:23:19 Everything about making a comic is hard.
00:23:21 I thought it could do it, I thought...
00:23:23 Hey, you know, some people start off...
00:23:25 crappy and the improver over time because they draw the comic and stuff and I thought you know I
00:23:30 could do it I'm slightly better than some people when they started off so I kind of have a little
00:23:35 you know um you know just a advantage of it and so I started making the comic and then just I just
00:23:42 realized I don't know how to lay out the panels I don't know where to place the speech bubbles
00:23:49 writing dialogue is hell and I just can't draw certain angles or like proportions are off like
00:23:57 most people see my finished art but they never see the art I scrap and I scrap so much art
00:24:03 because I just can't get the proportions right and it's ugly and it's gross and it's pissing me off
00:24:08 and I just hate my life I hate everything I quit goodbye well before you go would you say the
00:24:18 like the drawing stuff are coming up with like panels and and things would you say that's like
00:24:25 it's hard because you're already decently good at drawing so like learning something like it's
00:24:32 making comics is a whole different style of of drawing and since you're so good you have like
00:24:37 high standards for your finished works it's weird to just like settle for anything that isn't perfect
00:24:44 um kind of I guess I mean the whole topic on learning something new is a whole different
00:24:50 issue but the panels um I guess yeah when I put my art into panels or you know into comic form I
00:24:58 see it and I kind of feel like I could have done better this doesn't look like it as good as it
00:25:04 should have been oh backgrounds that reminds me I I had like a few month hiatus on one page
00:25:11 because I couldn't do a simple background for it and and then I came back and one day I was like
00:25:16 you know what I'm gonna do it and then I did it and kind of look crap but it better than it was
00:25:22 before and I was like and I'm gonna settle with this no one's perfect yeah it's I I particularly
00:25:30 have trouble like I've tried to draw comics I've tried to do everything everyone else has done
00:25:35 because I like I'm very competitive so you know with Tom and Ben being comic guys I tried drawing
00:25:41 a comic and I didn't like it so it was just because it was it was too hard to to instantly be great at
00:25:49 it it was too you know I knew I would have had to like work at it for ages I've been doing Inktober
00:25:56 as well and it was too hard to keep up with that because each drawing I was like okay I've got to
00:26:00 try and make it better than the last one more more properly drawn more clean and stuff and then as
00:26:07 the days went on it became harder and harder to to work that hard on a single drawing for a day
00:26:13 and also do anything else and so I just stopped doing it but really it is because I was making
00:26:20 it too hard on myself like I didn't need to put that much effort into the Inktober's I could have
00:26:25 just done funny little scribbles it's hard it's hard to settle for less that's what I'm thinking
00:26:33 um in drawing comics I stumble at drawing the same thing more than once that's when everything
00:26:41 falls apart oh this thing I drew I have to draw it again this time in a slightly different position
00:26:49 I feel you that's the end that you know just can't do it anymore yeah what's worse for me is I never
00:26:56 get like the face is similar or the eye shape or or something because every single time I draw the same
00:27:02 character I give them like different eyes or different nose or something like that and it's
00:27:06 just yeah it's so bothersome give hurt dot JP JP egg it's a credit those character designs are very
00:27:13 consistent the what hey you know you were talking about voice acting I was talking about voice acting
00:27:19 you know the thing about voice acting and uh getting frustrated and it that makes it really
00:27:24 annoying is that all of your emotions come out through your voicing whether or not you want
00:27:28 them to and that's why it's such a temperamental thing when I have to read a script and like you
00:27:32 know a lot of people they write scripts that are basically like hey everyone here's this thing it
00:27:36 came out in 1992.5 and you know that you can read in any sort of emotion that you want but when you
00:27:42 want to say something meaningful or something or something like deep or something that's supposed
00:27:46 to sound like it comes from some sort of personification of you you got to get the acting
00:27:53 just right and acting and reading a script can just really mess around with me because it like
00:27:59 the first time I'm going through I haven't like quite gotten down the flow of the thing yeah like
00:28:04 I would have would have written down like a like a paragraph and then I read the whole thing out
00:28:10 loud and I'm like wait a minute I didn't put any of the emphasis on the right words and it
00:28:14 I gotta do it again then when you go through it the second time I'm kind of getting a little
00:28:19 bit annoyed at myself I'm getting kind of tired of the script and so I'm getting a little bit
00:28:23 agitated and the agitation ruins everything so it's like it's almost like there's a limited
00:28:30 number of attempts you can do on a script before it's like worn out it's like removing and reapplying
00:28:36 tape onto a piece of paper you can know if you do it too many times you could never do it again
00:28:41 so you better get it right the first couple of times that's how it is for me or at least that's
00:28:46 how it was for me still kind of is it takes an unbelievable amount of very intense concentration
00:28:54 to have your have your mind be into the right lucid state of emotion to be able to pull off such a
00:29:01 feat yeah I know that oh you go now you go ahead okay well I was gonna say um I have that similar
00:29:10 sort of trouble but it's it's more like I forget to to act I forget to have emotion in my script
00:29:15 like I'm just reading it like and then blah blah and then you know I was like oh wait I should have
00:29:22 done a silly voice for that because that was a like it was a moment so I got to do it again with
00:29:26 silly voice and sometimes the silly voice seems forced and like that is dumb this is a bad this
00:29:31 is a bad joke it doesn't work I'm not I can't create the right funny sound for this word
00:29:37 particular word like sometimes I can create a funny sound just on its own but I'm trying to say
00:29:42 a word at the same time sometimes it just doesn't doesn't flow right so I have to cut that whole
00:29:47 paragraph out of the thing it is indeed very dependent on the entire writing style of what
00:29:54 you're trying to read yeah you guys like do proper videos and stuff me I struggled with
00:30:01 just like the basic videos I did a q&a and all I had to do I didn't have to do any sort of funny
00:30:05 voices or anything all I had to do was like sound interested in what I'm talking about and the
00:30:12 thing is like I have trouble pronouncing certain things and I had to redo my q&a like the recording
00:30:18 so many times that the end result just kind of I sounded dead just so uninterested so dead in
00:30:25 everything I said but by that time I was just so tired rereading the same things over and over again
00:30:32 and I just wanted that video to finally come out because it's been delayed for like such a long time
00:30:36 and I just I settled I'm not happy with it but I settled
00:30:43 the one thing about like recording audio for a video that I really hate is that you feel like
00:30:49 you got to do it all in one go like in one day like because the microphone is going to be set
00:30:54 up a certain way that day you're going to be sitting in a certain position that day recording it
00:30:58 you don't want to have to you don't want to have to stop and like you know even just take a break
00:31:04 because you're you're going to come back you're going to have either more air in your lungs or
00:31:08 something and it's going to sound weird or different and I don't like it I I guess it's not too bad if
00:31:14 you're like more energetic the second time but I like I like it when I can get most of it correct
00:31:20 in within a few hours and yeah same it's it's really good when that happens I was I was dancing
00:31:27 I was jumping around after after I recorded the Rayman thing because I did a whole bit where
00:31:32 I go more insane and more like more broken as that as it goes along and by the end I was doing a full
00:31:39 blown broken matte impression and it was really good oh my gosh yeah that's a secret spoiler I guess
00:31:47 I could cut that out but you know whatever PCP fans deserve to know spoilers spoilers uh well
00:31:57 you know this has been about 30 minutes it's about as long as I was expecting part one of the
00:32:02 PCP would be so anything else you too I came in at the very tail and I thought it was going to start
00:32:09 like right now at the moment at the round hour at like three well if you have more to say we can
00:32:15 keep going for a bit nah I complained enough for the day mage could be the one who can appear in
00:32:20 both parts yeah so what we're doing is that it's just me and hippo and then the other guys are
00:32:26 gonna show up they're gonna do their part they don't even realize what we're doing they don't
00:32:29 even realize that we're recording this whole first part it's too hard for them to read that we
00:32:34 we said we were gonna do yes I said we were gonna do it or I proposed it and uh no one read it so
00:32:40 we just did it without them uh so what you could do is you could appear in both parts and just say
00:32:45 the same stuff twice and they won't even know yes you should definitely do that now all right
00:32:51 everyone uh we're gonna move on to part two just imagine a kc nice that is flipping the
00:32:56 camera around and we transition into the next part goodbye bye hello everyone and welcome to
00:33:02 part two of this week's episode of the procrastinator's podcast we by the way have no idea what the
00:33:09 other guys talked about so judge us with mercy if we are redundant or talk about the same
00:33:17 shit because they didn't tell us and we don't want to know we didn't care to ask what happened in
00:33:22 part one anyway it's me the best guy ever uh we got uh did you bro hey endless jizz yep lethal mage
00:33:32 man greetings and tom oliver i am here hooray yes celebration all around and mage is our undercover
00:33:43 agent for what they talked about in the first part if that is relevant that's true they didn't
00:33:51 know that you were gonna you were gonna tell all it was gonna be an expose anyway so again
00:33:57 thing is uh for some reason the topic is uh why is everything so fucking hard and why can't everything
00:34:05 be easy uh and i'll tell you preach it yeah what say that again preach it i said i said hallelujah
00:34:13 okay jesus yeah oh baby jesus everything's too hard it's very true i was watching um uh
00:34:22 metalocalypse recently i've gotten really big into metalocalypse over the last week again and i
00:34:28 happened to see this part where maybe the best character william murder face murder face murder
00:34:35 face uh is walking along and he's he's just real upset because he wants everything in life to be
00:34:42 easy and he sings this amazing song about how everything in life deserves to be handed to him
00:34:47 on a silver platter and anything that takes effort isn't worth doing and i uh agree he is my role
00:34:54 model in that aspect he really makes a strong case for it where you're like yeah yeah why isn't
00:35:00 everything easy fuck this fuck everything yeah it's it's tough to disagree so uh
00:35:08 we're just i want to just talk about all the things that are way too fucking hard and aren't
00:35:14 worth doing uh number one is making this podcast every week it takes so much work to get you
00:35:20 fucking people in here to talk about shit it's a nightmare waking up in time when like the rest
00:35:26 of you are doing this let me like i'm like i'm like i'm like laying in my bed on my on my fucking
00:35:33 on my 10 million dollar air mattress from the kickstarter in my fucking castle and you know
00:35:41 my fucking my laptop starts yelling at me nate's figured out how to make the laptop yell at me it's
00:35:46 it was really yes i have like get up and go to the podcast i'm like no just just getting up and waking
00:35:51 up and getting on the podcast it's like a monumental hercules and it's like the the 12
00:35:56 labors of hercules just to get on this podcast and entertain you freaks believe me i completely
00:36:03 empathize with how much work you guys all put into letting me edit this podcast every week
00:36:09 it's it's tough man you don't understand the effort it takes to have faith that you won't
00:36:13 fuck it up it's a big it's a big hurdle you know fucking talk about effort i'm at work
00:36:20 right now hiding in the corner so the fucking camera can't see me dicking around in the middle
00:36:25 of my rounds at work to record this part why do you think i'm never fucking here because i have to
00:36:30 yeah he's just at work god damn why is work so hard why do i have to slave but why is my life
00:36:35 a burden upon myself well i didn't choose to be born and yet here i am yeah we're going off the
00:36:42 deep end right that's that's true uh you know we we didn't ask for any of the struggles in life
00:36:48 that our parents forced upon us by selfishly producing us and here we are having to pay the
00:36:53 piper every fucking day having to punch that clock only to die one day and making it all completely
00:36:59 pointless why are we here only to suffer it's true i agree sometimes let's let's all just kill
00:37:05 ourselves right now and that's that's pretty easy this is really dark and i like it but even
00:37:13 killing yourself is fucking hard it'd be oh it's so hard not worth doing it's it's just like in that
00:37:18 episode of paranoia agent where those three suicidal dudes which is like the best episode of that show
00:37:23 or any show by the way where they just get together and try to kill themselves but it's such a fucking
00:37:27 chore man it's it's rough isn't it heavily implied that they are already at the end they do seem to
00:37:35 be ghosts but it's unclear when or if that happened you know it's it's mysterious which i like
00:37:43 yeah everyone should watch it anyway it's great you should at least that episode well i don't know
00:37:50 the little slugger's cool i don't i don't think spoiling that episode takes anything away from it
00:37:56 well that's a whole other argument spoiled something that's ambiguous anyways you you would
00:38:00 have to sit on it and come that's a good point just to know what i haven't seen the last three
00:38:04 episodes been procrastinating on that so don't spoil you've been procrastinating for for 10 years
00:38:10 how is that show now it shows for like 2004 i didn't know it existed up until like last year
00:38:16 and then you've been procrastinating for a year yes tisk tisk that's still pretty long well whatever
00:38:22 i i i haven't finished uh that's that's right that's right i uh whatever there's tons of stuff
00:38:29 i also haven't finished they started bakimono gatsuri being one of them that i've watched episode
00:38:34 like one through three for like like eight times like fucking eight times that i've never gotten
00:38:40 passed at uh because it's too fucking hard to make time to watch it oh my god watching
00:38:46 shit is the worst fucking burden there's so it never ends the the pile of the mountain of
00:38:52 stuff that you need to fucking consume and get inside your brain you can't ever chip away at it
00:38:57 they keep making new stuff faster than any man could possibly watch all the curse of the internet
00:39:02 could be able to become acutely aware of how much shit you're never going to be able to understand
00:39:07 about our job they think that we just make stuff now this is this is like two full-time jobs because
00:39:13 half my job is making stuff the other half is consuming stuff it's two jobs that should be full
00:39:18 time and i'm trying to bounce them out it's impossible by long and far the hardest thing
00:39:23 about my job is watching anime because like yeah like that sounds insane it sounds like
00:39:29 people will think that you're like that sounds retarded but it's totally true right well because
00:39:34 i don't know until i watch a show if i'm gonna have something to say about it right so like for me
00:39:40 like the most grueling part of my job is deciding which show i'm gonna watch because i'm so afraid
00:39:46 to watch something you know for four hours and then find out that i didn't have enough to say
00:39:50 about it to make a video and then that's just four hours i mean i can somewhat justify it and like
00:39:56 okay well at least i've expanded my knowledge of anime in some way you know at least this contributes
00:40:00 to my overall ability to to pull from different places to to have ideas but and your your life
00:40:06 goal of watching all anime right that's still on the table right i don't know if i want to watch all
00:40:11 like book i'm glad you changed when i was like 10 years old and i first discovered the anime and
00:40:16 i was like i'm gonna watch all the anime in the entire world i definitely and by the little
00:40:21 did you sample every anime in the entire world like every every single night when i like when i
00:40:26 get off sony vegas for the night finally and i and i get down on my couch and i start thinking
00:40:31 okay i should watch something well let's see what what's this what's this black mirror show on
00:40:35 netflix no wait there's this other show on sci-fi about the channel zero show no wait there's probably
00:40:40 a new south park out no way isn't there like haven't i missed like 10 my little pony episodes
00:40:44 no wait i should have watched this entire fucking series over here there's five anime i just for
00:40:51 the weebcast i had to watch like 40 fucking shows and and the thing about it is with anime with the
00:40:59 yeah it's understandable with with anime specifically i like i've gotten into star trek recently in a
00:41:05 big way and the great thing about star trek is this people just talking and you really don't
00:41:08 need to pay that much attention when you got a show in gook you gotta read the fucking subtitles
00:41:14 you gotta watch the animation because it involves you cannot do anything else while you're watching
00:41:19 anime and that's it's such a fucking pain in the ass strenuous thing and you know what you want to
00:41:25 just learn japanese but that's fucking hard to exactly so hard god learning japanese if there's
00:41:31 one thing that i have the biggest chip on my shoulder about how hard it is it's learning japanese
00:41:36 because the spoken dialect is easy as shit they have an alphabet that's easy as shit
00:41:42 but then they have the kanji and it's just thousands and thousands of meaningless fucking symbols
00:41:49 that not only not only do they all look exactly the same but they all have a specific order that
00:41:55 they have to be drawn in true i know yeah i took chinese and it's the same written thing and it's
00:42:01 bullshit the fact that you have to draw it in the right order or it's wrong and it's oh my god it's
00:42:05 fucking stupid and you know what sucks is that your brain hates you because every year you put off
00:42:10 learning japanese your brain becomes more set in his ways it becomes harder to learn another language
00:42:15 i know it's just like you know it's the worst learning any language is fucking unbearably
00:42:20 impossible like i took french in high school i don't remember any of it i took spanish in college
00:42:26 i don't remember any of it you know i'm watching the anime is i'm trying to i'm i'm trying to
00:42:31 understand the language sometimes i feel like i'm understanding the language every once in a while
00:42:36 i'll pick out like a like a like a kudasai or some word that i understand that i'm like yes
00:42:42 yes i got it i can i can watch this whole anime now without reading the subtitles but it's all for
00:42:46 not because it never stays it's important like learning anything and i fucking hate myself
00:42:53 the saddest part for me is that i like for years i've had this dream that one day i'll learn how to
00:42:58 read japanese well enough that i'll be able to get into manga because so much manga doesn't get
00:43:03 translated most of the the really good stuff the stuff that i really want to read isn't getting
00:43:07 translated but on some level i'm sounds like a grass is always greener so yeah oh they're only
00:43:13 translating the bad stuff i'm glad that i can't read japanese because if i could then that would
00:43:19 just be thousands of manga i now have to read you know now i have a whole new world of shit i have to
00:43:26 do you know well you know i mean uh i don't know if this is true but in like shown and jump
00:43:31 everything is hiragana uh in a dude where there's there's a lot yeah is it seriously i had no idea
00:43:36 yeah well yeah for whatever all children's manga have little furigana over the over the
00:43:42 bleach isn't for children don't say that yeah but uh but yeah i mean it makes it easier to to learn
00:43:47 to like you can it's an easy way to learn kanji by doing that but i one time tried i opened up a
00:43:53 volume of inuyasha because i like i was on this uh it was like how to learn japanese through manga
00:43:58 like a thing and there was all these different manga and inuyasha was there and i was like oh i
00:44:02 know inuyasha so i opened up page one and i quickly realized that i just straight up didn't know any of
00:44:07 the words so that was no help oh that's the thing the i mean like jesse was saying before uh if you
00:44:13 watch a lot of anime you can learn a bunch of phrase i remember distinctly i learned the word
00:44:17 daijobu before i studied japanese and i was like it's because uh it's because the fourth opening
00:44:22 of one piece kokoro cheese starts with daijobu and it's okay and as the subtitles i get this word
00:44:28 now but uh when it comes to like constructing sentences or being able to you know reverse
00:44:33 engineer them which is what you're doing in your brain when you're translating from another language
00:44:36 to english it's impossible if you don't sit down and say that shit have you ever the scene in a movie
00:44:40 that i always bought you ever watched the 13th warrior no it's a movie with antonio benders it's
00:44:45 about like he's like an arab guy i don't know why he's an arab guy but he's an arab guy and he has to
00:44:49 like hang out with all these nordic people and there's a scene where he's like sitting around
00:44:52 at the campfire over the course of like a couple weeks and he just learns nordic just by listening
00:44:57 to them and i'm like that's such bullshit no one can fucking do that to this day that pisses me off
00:45:04 i mean for what it's worth i am perfectly capable of watching like a children's anime and
00:45:08 understanding all of it like i don't think the language is hard it's just the it's just reading
00:45:14 it that's impossible and in particularly in inuyasha's case because the scenes take place in ancient
00:45:20 japan there's a lot of ancient dialect which is why i could not understand what i was looking at in
00:45:24 that particular case mage can you tell me about that because i i still i don't believe anyone i think
00:45:29 you're lying i think there's a conspiracy to make me feel stupid so please explain how you learned
00:45:35 english from cartoons okay when i was little like four years old or something i kind of broke the
00:45:41 video tape player thingy by thinking it needs food so i fed it stuff
00:45:47 so my parents got cable it was cartoon network holy shit yeah they got the cartoon network
00:45:56 so i watched cartoon network and everything was in english haza and me a four year old was entertained
00:46:02 by moving pictures and i didn't care that didn't understand the language but over time i started
00:46:07 picking up stuff here and there and by seven or eight i could speak english fine enough for what
00:46:14 it's worth when you're like four that's like the stage where you're learning language either way
00:46:20 like i mean arguably we all learned english from watching cartoons and you know in our parents and
00:46:27 you know language and then having a world just proof that we get dumber as we get older because
00:46:32 if you can learn it like i've been watching anime for like 15 years and i still haven't learned any
00:46:36 japanese ever in like four words i i also started learning german from tv again just at a later time
00:46:44 at around 12 years old or so um i discovered that i have a german channel and there was anime that's
00:46:50 the first time i discovered anime was at eight years old never mind anywho either way um so i
00:46:55 started learning uh german and everything was fine until they canceled the uh or at least we didn't
00:47:02 get the channel anymore we weren't supposed to get the channel in the first place apparently
00:47:06 but still so i took german in school and the german classes didn't teach me quite as much as tv
00:47:14 taught me and it's just because like it kind of feels like when you're hearing it it's kind of like
00:47:20 you're hearing it in practice like you hear how it's spoken how it's used in uh conversations it's
00:47:25 never you cannot substitute that with uh learning from books and stuff and i had such a difference
00:47:31 with like um students who in my class who learned english just from books had like such a thick accent
00:47:42 and they couldn't grasp such subtleties and weird stuff that's going on with english like let's say
00:47:48 the word knife it starts with k they can't they don't have the intuition to know that the case
00:47:54 and i did and yeah so i was kind of a prodigy up until like the very last years of school where
00:48:00 i became at the top of the class but not the best uh so yeah this is supposed to be a complaining
00:48:06 about things being too hard yes this is bragging why would a genius i am so much smarter than americans
00:48:12 it's so hard to live up to european standards i didn't ask you to tell us what a genius you are
00:48:16 that's my job because i'm the smartest guy everyone else is dumb compared to me i'm not a genius i've
00:48:21 learned english from cartoons you just called yourself a prodigy you fucking did it
00:48:25 no in comparison to the people in my class in comparison to me in comparison to me you piece of
00:48:31 shit i'm trying to fucking strangle you well okay you know i did want to say that i had i had that
00:48:38 very same experience um in fact just the other day i was reflecting on like if i was learning english
00:48:44 from a textbook i wouldn't be able to speak it uh like colloquially at all it would be a total
00:48:49 clusterfuck like people who are learning the language because when i was in japan um the rudimentary
00:48:54 japanese that i learned was like in no way would i be able to pass for like just having a conversation
00:49:00 even knowing a decent amount of vocabulary and grammar and conjugation and shit it's just like i
00:49:06 no matter what i did i would sound like a weirdo outsider in any context i mean i was a beginner
00:49:11 language podcast but i guess language is the most hard thing that i'm the most upset about how hard
00:49:17 it is you know i i thought this was going to go more towards uh jobs and money and that kind of
00:49:24 stuff because that is what's on my mind mortality we did talk about right in the beginning so like
00:49:29 we can only go up from there that's like the hardest thing that's true well nate i've spent the past
00:49:35 probably 11 or 12 hours building is no god more than that i've spent like the last 16 hours building
00:49:41 a spreadsheet and i've been having a good time i feel building a snowman no i feel mostly dead
00:49:50 inside but but i feel like i'm also doing the thing that my that i was built to do uh so why don't
00:49:57 you tell us about the experience of being a horrible horrible corporate corporate slut yeah
00:50:03 well uh yeah in fact i was just talking to a friend yesterday about how when i made the podcast
00:50:09 i felt such a sense of euphoria and nothing about the video is impressive
00:50:13 but i didn't even think about it it just my body just did them the mechanics of it
00:50:18 automatically and it's because i've been doing it for years now and i know what to do but more
00:50:22 importantly it's because doing it in itself is rewarding and feels good and i like doing it and
00:50:27 that is of course completely opposed to what i do most of my time during the week or you know the
00:50:33 40 hours out of my week i have to spend at work 40 hours plus probably more like 60 with
00:50:38 all the other shit but i mean i have to go into work and do my job and i go home but that time
00:50:45 is not spent doing things that i am interested in or i'm particularly want to do for much longer
00:50:51 and my my my only goal going there is to you know do my work at a decent level and pacify everyone
00:50:58 until such time that i can no longer be forced to do these things because and the it's all because
00:51:03 i have to be able to make enough money to do you know youtube and and other stuff that i want to do
00:51:08 and if we lived in star trek world i would be able to do my shit right fucking now you know it's
00:51:13 the same with my little pony actually you just you you can pursue the things that you want to do
00:51:18 and that's just how society is set up to reward the things that not not only i mean come on people
00:51:24 not only is it the thing i like to do but you've seen the results of what i can do when i am given
00:51:30 the time and the ability to do these things it's unquestionable that my performance is so much
00:51:36 better when i'm doing these things and i am so much more of an asset to humanity when i'm doing
00:51:41 these things instead of these fucking yeah that's everyone go to my fucking patreon give me money
00:51:47 it's like there's this guy jock fresco and he's like 90 something years old now but he yeah he
00:51:53 might be dead i don't even know i've been like read up on him in like a couple years but ever
00:51:57 since the 70s he's been talking about like this like society he designed where you don't need money
00:52:02 and everything is just done by machines and like nobody will listen to him and he's like old and
00:52:07 crotchy now you're just like fucking everyone's retarded i have the answer and nobody will listen
00:52:11 to me i'm just like that's the fucking hardest thing ever when you have the answer and everyone
00:52:16 just like yeah but no that's true that is true i'd like to hear more about his philosophy at some
00:52:22 point it's pretty cool he's just like science is more important than politics and if we measure
00:52:29 everything we can measure how much the carrying capacity of the earth like how much resources
00:52:34 are on earth and how to distribute it so everyone can survive and then we can computerize and
00:52:39 digitize everything so all the base tasks that we have to do can be done by machines instead
00:52:45 and then people can just pursue higher education and do things that are intellectually and creatively
00:52:51 stimulating and i'm like you see that's the thing yeah because i i just did a vlog on this on on
00:52:57 bestie boy my other channel about um fuck i don't even remember what it was about but it was it was
00:53:03 talking about an issue of how uh we are oh god i'm completely blanking i forgot what i was fucking
00:53:11 saying quick tom cover uh you are going to be talking about how we are like forced to do all
00:53:16 this shit that we don't want to do and like i don't i don't even watch the vlog about the vlog it
00:53:21 was about the heat death of the universe rapidly approaching and it was no matter how much humanity
00:53:27 progresses we will ultimately die in the long run oh oh i remember what i was going to say it was just
00:53:31 about how uh inevitably we will reach a point i mean if we don't all die first where uh every
00:53:37 single job that is currently done by humans will be done by machines and what are we how are we
00:53:42 gonna choose to live are we going to let everyone die because well they don't they're not the most
00:53:47 efficient tool for doing this so we might as well you know fuck them they're let them die or do we
00:53:52 want to structure our society in a way that this technology supports the the human drive to create
00:53:57 explore here's the thing though think about this yeah this has already happened once like back in the
00:54:01 day the industrial revolution happened and since everything was based on industry there was there
00:54:06 was a legit a split for a while if you read up on it there was like are we gonna shorten the work
00:54:10 day to three days a week or are we going to invent new ways to make people fucking suck balls and
00:54:15 do this shit oh i wonder which one we chose and here we are so if you think that this
00:54:19 mechanization is going to lead us to some utopia no no no they're going to find a way
00:54:24 to have us toil away do some new shit that we can't digitize yet now i don't believe that
00:54:29 that has to be the case i think that it has to be the case but i think there's definitely like a
00:54:33 structure in place that would crumble if right people actually actualize their own potential
00:54:39 examining examining how making excel spreadsheet so the boss man could be
00:54:43 happy yeah examining how that process uh has affected humans and how we've dealt with it
00:54:47 previously is definitely a good tool to predict what we might do in the future but when we get to
00:54:53 the point where it's either change the system or every literally everyone is obsolete except
00:54:58 maybe a handful of people who are running the whole thing at that point we have to make some
00:55:03 i would rely on people's moral compass to say that human life has value it's generally a good
00:55:09 thing it would be best if we kept people alive and didn't just let them all die as machines start
00:55:15 doing their jobs and they just can't afford the abundant resources that are available now
00:55:19 because human labor is worthless i hope that we can get over that hump you know what else is
00:55:24 because otherwise life would be pretty hard what's that digi yeah you know what else is way
00:55:29 too hard are you talking about my dick is my dick and here's why that's a problem
00:55:35 because my dick is so hard but i have i have nothing to put it in because dating is the hardest
00:55:41 thing oh god oh what what is more time consuming and asinine and difficult than trying to find
00:55:53 i'll tell you exactly i'll tell you exactly what's more difficult than that it's trying to do
00:55:59 literally anything and having five different fucking girlfriends at once all messaging you
00:56:04 at fucking 24 seven every hour of every day they just want to talk about bullshit there's
00:56:09 fucking 50 of them they never shut up i can't do anything you know it was great you know it was
00:56:13 great jesse uh a few when i was at college i had a i had an elaborate spider's net of
00:56:20 fuck buddies strewn about my college campus and it was great because i never talked to any of them
00:56:25 except to just arrange sex that's the only thing we did that's that's like it's like that but on a
00:56:30 global scale is my method but they all okay all right i'm just i'm so goddamn cool that they all
00:56:36 just fall in love with me and they all just want to talk to me all the time and i just want to blow
00:56:40 my brains out it's not worth it i'd rather i'd rather blow off my dick and blow off my brain
00:56:46 and die it's a delicate balance making them uh want to have sex with you but never speak but
00:56:51 also not like me that's what i'm trying to write right the problem i'm having is that every once
00:56:57 in a while i think huh maybe i should try to get a girlfriend and then i remember that to do that i
00:57:03 have to like i have to put in a cons a concentrated effort into actually like like somehow obtaining
00:57:12 a relationship because you don't even it's true it's not possible to just do that in in the course
00:57:18 of my everyday life you know like some people like when you're in when you're in school if you're
00:57:22 in college if you have a job you run into people you see people around you you might have to talk
00:57:28 to someone as a result of i don't know doing a project together or something yeah but if you
00:57:34 live in a house by you know with just you and like six bros and all you do is work at home
00:57:43 and you never go out anywhere then there's no reason i would ever encounter a woman
00:57:49 unless i was seeking out a woman which means that yeah which means that i have to take time
00:57:55 out of my schedule out of my day out of my work out of everything i've got going on all the irons
00:58:01 i've gotten the fire i got to lift all those irons out of the fire temporarily just in just
00:58:08 so i can even try to go and talk to a woman and then i just hear a cat where's the kitty where is
00:58:16 it i think it's amazing yeah talk about how great cats are that's the new topic cats cats have no
00:58:24 difficulty with anything cats the whole life's true you know digi uh you're you're absolutely
00:58:31 right about this and this has been one of the greatest struggles this is probably the big one
00:58:35 forget death i mean what what did what did the director of silent hill to say uh every human
00:58:40 is possessed it's compelled by only two factors sex and death they they make up the you know the
00:58:46 core of the of the human soul our fear of one and the quest for the other and it's absolutely true
00:58:51 that they're you know with our current society especially with with people who work the way we
00:58:55 do our jobs are basically isolationists they don't involve interaction with anyone except maybe a
00:59:02 select few number of people and our only way to satisfy this beastial urge inside of us
00:59:09 is to fucking devote massive amounts of time to fucking doing this shit because that's the
00:59:14 thing about the normie life that's so different when you're a normie you're you're you're grinding
00:59:18 your your uh your you know social skills most of that time all that time is being you're you're
00:59:24 taking levels in in you know socialization i'm just saying being involved that i'm not saying
00:59:29 i'm just saying exposure time yeah like exposure time that you're out doing this stuff
00:59:33 that's what i'm talking about well i just think like i think you know when i was in high school i
00:59:38 saw it as like oh oh ben's oh ben's muted uh when i was in high school i saw it more like um you
00:59:46 know i'm awkward i don't know how to talk to to girls i don't know how to do this and that you
00:59:51 know oh it'd be weird oh i don't want to have my heart broken none of that is what i'm concerned
00:59:55 about now it's just time the amount of time it takes to go out of your way to seek someone
01:00:02 it's something i never would have thought about before you know like growing up i was so concerned
01:00:07 with the the usual stuff like oh you know is she gonna like me now i'm like am i gonna have to
01:00:15 like actually spend hours of my day swiping in a different i don't even know which direction is
01:00:21 approved on tinder uh which are the right dog always to the right okay so you know how do i
01:00:27 actually have to spend hours of my day swiping on on like weird fractured information of other
01:00:33 people you know i've sat around trying to think of if i started a dating profile what would i write
01:00:38 on it and i have no idea i don't know how to describe myself other than like through nothing
01:00:44 ganzo otaku right i'm a big internet celebrity that's the thing what you need is when you're
01:00:51 boiling yourself down to like especially for shit like this it's like how am i going to attract someone
01:00:56 to be interested in me that's the thing like i don't understand how did you can be saying it's
01:01:01 hard to attract people with his audience when i've been doing it for years with my tiny microscopic
01:01:07 audience compared to his i wouldn't even be talking about like my audience that's all you gotta do
01:01:13 you gotta utilize the fame all you gotta do is make a tweet and say hey people who follow me on
01:01:17 twitter one of you has to have a vagina i'm famous we'll see the thing is let's let's all tweet
01:01:23 about this after we're done here and see what kind of results we get i'm like building myself up because
01:01:28 when i think of how i describe myself i think every every every person who likes one of my tweets
01:01:33 if i see in their picture that they're a girl i make a mental note and i write it down to that's
01:01:39 the effort i'm talking about that's the that's the going through the trouble that i'm that i'm so
01:01:45 against well i mean it's sometimes like that's the whole thing is like is what's the is there
01:01:49 a difference between something being too hard and something requiring a lot of effort are they
01:01:53 synonymous well they're they are there is a lift to murder face man i i would agree there is a subtle
01:01:59 difference it's a lot easier for me to do a lot of work if it's just something i want to do like i
01:02:05 just said i've been building a spreadsheet for like 14 straight hours and i it's probably gonna
01:02:10 take another 14 to finish it and it's just so easy for me to zone out and plug names into a
01:02:18 spreadsheet because it's like this is something that only i can do and i enjoy doing it and it
01:02:24 you know it's you know it's a good way to pass the time and i don't have to think about anything
01:02:28 i don't have to think about existential dread or you know like the effort it would take to get a
01:02:34 girlfriend i could just plug away at the spreadsheet and not think about the world at all it's you
01:02:38 know you brought up you brought up zoning out which is the same thing i brought up before i
01:02:42 wonder if it's an issue of shifting your ability to do these things from your conscious like intense
01:02:47 effort mind into sort of a that your subconscious are able to sort of do it without really putting
01:02:52 the the the forcing yourself to do it into it yeah maybe maybe that's relevant to ride a bike
01:02:58 or when you uh enter a car you know what to do after doing it like hundreds of times yeah i think
01:03:05 i think my two favorite states of mind are either absolutely no thoughts just like doing a thing
01:03:13 that's menial which is why i love making lists so much because that's just like there's no brain
01:03:18 activity there it's just structure i'll say and and the other one is like when i'm writing and that's
01:03:26 where it's like super heightened brain and it's like thousands of thoughts happening at once and
01:03:31 all of them are beautiful and it's like life affirming and makes me feel like a genius anything
01:03:35 between those two states is just shit it's you know uh thinking about death and how i'm spinning
01:03:44 my wheels towards it to get on to another sort of topic another big problem uh about that's that's
01:03:50 so hard that there's literally nothing you can do about it it's just dealing with other people
01:03:55 and having to put up with their bullshit that they do to you all the time and let me give an example
01:04:00 and it was just i i went for a run because i'm trying to be a good person and better myself and
01:04:05 not be a fat sack of shit taxing our health care system in america uh and i'm out doing my thing
01:04:11 and on my way back i'm exhausted from running i'm walking out i'm i'm you know running on the side
01:04:16 of the road across a uh an exit of uh of like a pizza place these and these it's fucking family
01:04:23 and their fucking station wagon comes barreling down to like 30 miles an hour and i'm i'm like
01:04:29 i'm not like half a mile before they fucking get to me i'm in the middle of the road and he fucking
01:04:33 smashes like he smashes on the accelerator coming towards me faster coming out of this
01:04:39 fucking exit of this this this fat factory and i'm just like i'm just screaming at this telling
01:04:44 what are you doing what the fuck are you doing i'm right here running in the middle of the road
01:04:48 don't you see me you stupid piece of human garbage you are in your whole family or cancer
01:04:53 you should all be fucking die i hope you choke on your pizza you fat sacks of shit yeah so
01:04:59 you know all that stuff all that stuff yeah people are in annoyance like there's like a 95
01:05:05 percentage of everyone in the world just sucks and shouldn't be talked to ever should be euthanized
01:05:12 slight addendum would would put that spit on it i think euthanized is too peaceful for them i think
01:05:17 that yeah that's why people should have their heads
01:05:21 wopped off with a rusty fucking machete in the town square i don't really have run-ins with
01:05:26 annoying people outside the internet but dealing with people the internet is definitely a point
01:05:31 that you don't run into anybody so i mean that's the plus side to your isolation is you're isolated
01:05:37 yeah i should have scouted those but you're also isolated from all the retards and there's a lot
01:05:42 more retards out there i'll tell you that i should have scouted that little that like
01:05:46 five-year-old daughter in the backseat for a potential girlfriend i should have
01:05:49 well i blew it man i blew my chance yeah i like that like i should have offered in trade as as a
01:05:56 piece of agreement he has to offer me his first born daughter you sons of bitches get out of the
01:06:00 road by the way i'm single you know that that makes me upset too me and me and uh um and a bunch
01:06:10 and everyone else in the house we all took this quiz that monkey had taken on his uh on his show
01:06:16 it was like a normie quiz like it's see how normie you are right and like monkey and and
01:06:22 basically everybody else got like slightly strange right like uh you know you're you're not quite
01:06:27 normie but then me and victor and shade we all got normie victor and shade got chat status
01:06:33 they were straight up chat and i got normie they've got girlfriends so that's like thousand
01:06:37 points right well that's the thing i'm looking at this i'm like man i ended up being a normie
01:06:42 and mostly just because i have lots of money and like i'm not i'm not ugly i have lots and
01:06:48 lots of money and i have had sex before and that's enough to get you pretty much to normie status
01:06:53 but i was like how can i possibly be a normie when i feel like this this this this alien creature
01:06:59 you know who's in his room talking about how hard it is to go outside and socialize with anybody
01:07:05 how can this possibly be normie but that's what that's what you get for putting your faith in an
01:07:09 online quiz well sure i mean there's that but i also feel like this is the world we live in now
01:07:14 this is what it like normies now are people who don't even leave their house and talk to other
01:07:20 people you know maybe are they though i don't know maybe the classical idea of the normie it
01:07:25 doesn't even like maybe they're not even out there roaming you know i've been outside sometimes i don't
01:07:31 see a lot of people out there where the hell are they where are the normies if they're supposedly
01:07:35 outside having normie has changed if i don't think you're a normie i think like because of like you
01:07:40 know technology and stuff everyone is connecting more via the internet than real life and like people
01:07:45 don't go outside and just hang out like that's not which i hate by the way how the fuck am i gonna
01:07:50 know if a girl is fuckable before pursuing her if i don't see her in real life or have an up-to-date
01:07:55 recent picture it is unacceptable to me it's very these things are not happening
01:08:00 like if i i could i could find a girl who's super into me on twitter and spend like
01:08:04 fucking hour talking to her then find out she's a total ham beast what what am i gonna do you know
01:08:09 you know what the worst thing is it's when they do the like that they they have the face photos
01:08:12 where they look up and it looks okay but then you know oh my god pair chan dude the pair chan
01:08:17 syndrome it's it's it's everywhere that's really that's that's the ultimate disappointment i mean
01:08:23 just don't trust any pictures taken from above because everybody looks very true it's yeah i gotta
01:08:29 say i gotta say everyone this conversation is becoming a total sausage fest so i'm here
01:08:35 that i hope you're i'm i've been saying well i'm here to destroy all men
01:08:41 thank please do please do do it for all of us put us out of our misery let's let me talk about
01:08:48 let me just throw my hat in the ring and say that i am depressed that i am lonely that i hate
01:08:55 i hate it here and the tinder doesn't work in virginia beach digi what do you mean by
01:09:01 how can that work i mean it doesn't fucking work i mean it used to work where i used to live it
01:09:06 doesn't work i was hindering the whole time i was there i think did it work i think he means
01:09:11 that he hasn't got no it didn't well the app worked i mean it turned on that's not what it means for
01:09:17 i got more matches in one week at digi's house on tinder i have ever here where i mean oh my god
01:09:24 what constitutes success what constitutes success at tinder do you have to actually get laid is that
01:09:29 a successful tinder usage okay yes all right that is establishing it that's like the only reason
01:09:33 that app exists isn't it well no no i'm not disparaging that i'm just wondering what your
01:09:37 criteria is for i didn't know that was the point i just like the endorphin rush of getting a match
01:09:42 that to me means i've won the game you haven't won the game matches are easy
01:09:48 well not here they're not not for me but you i used to get a lot the success of tinder is very
01:09:54 area-based i've tried tinder a few times and my area is just full of like super normies and
01:09:59 everyone on there is wearing a fucking red socks hat and like goes out to sporting things and like
01:10:04 just has pictures of them though their girlfriends getting drunk i'm just like god forbid i would
01:10:09 execute all of you have given the chance so those are the only people that live around here
01:10:15 genocide is par for the course in here but pay attention you guys catch up
01:10:18 this is the most eliot roger podcast we've done in at least a couple weeks
01:10:22 no it's good that's how it should be i would love a i would i i want a girl who likes sports
01:10:26 that's cool i think like a fucking like a lin loud i'd be all over a lin loud i'd i'd rain
01:10:32 calm on lin loud well all right but i want a girl who's got a brain and always speaks
01:10:38 he's saying he's saying the loud sisters don't have brains they're genius there's all of them
01:10:44 here's how cool i am i don't care what a girl's interests are they don't have anything to do
01:10:49 with me ladies i okay but put to for a real argument here uh is it really necessary that a
01:10:58 couple you know be it for a hookup or a long-term thing is it really necessary that they let's
01:11:04 take digi for an example is it necessary that the person he dates be like into the same things
01:11:10 he is into no as opposed to just enjoying if you're absolutely not if you're going for something
01:11:15 long-term then i'd say absolutely yes i don't think it's necessary for any maybe in any case
01:11:21 yeah mage running three or four years now uh it's not mandatory to have all of the same
01:11:28 uh hobbies or interests yeah that's that's what i think that people who are my relationship
01:11:34 personally is the similar sense of humor and i think that's like yeah i think uh vacation people
01:11:40 who are inexperienced put way too much emphasis on finding someone who is into the same shit
01:11:46 it's more about having you know for the record i i i do i don't even want a girlfriend to be into
01:11:54 the same stuff that i am because i'm an elitist about the things i like and sure like you know i
01:12:00 mean most of the time like my ex-girlfriend was way into anime but like the wrong ones so that was
01:12:06 just actually no no it was actually more a source of a source of pain for me that it was a source of
01:12:12 like you know it was fun to watch anime together but we had to watch i prefer a girl who is into
01:12:19 nothing that i'm into so that i can mold her into having all the right opinions yeah sure
01:12:23 yeah it's a girlfriend from the ground up just like christian westerchandler promised
01:12:27 girlfriend from the ground up also hi mage good to see you again
01:12:34 girlfriend i know i know but i but i was muted girlfriend from the ground up sounds like it could
01:12:38 be a disney song like at the beginning of the movie when he's looking for princess oh i'm gonna get a
01:12:44 girlfriend from the ground up the christian west and she's gonna be pretty and fancy somebody make it
01:12:51 please i'm thinking i'm thinking this particular disney movie is about a bunch of like anthropomorphic
01:12:56 plants okay and like and like the main character is like a little like a little like vegetable
01:13:02 that wants to grow a girlfriend oh my god that's pretty good wait but wouldn't that make him a
01:13:07 pedophile if we you know it doesn't work the same way in their society oh right okay they've got
01:13:14 judge mcjudge mcjudson plants are incompetent that's you're you're you're just like christian
01:13:20 thinking that he has to teleport his son at you eggs back in time 18 years for the sex in the
01:13:25 comic for fuck's sake they can mature they can mature at different rates do dogs have to wait to
01:13:30 be 18 before they fuck know you say that but in australia i believe it's illegal to make real life
01:13:36 pornography of actresses over 18 if they look under the age of that's that's unrelated no no what
01:13:42 i think it's what no what the similar problem would be is if you're not allowed to film animal
01:13:47 pornography unless the animal is over the human age of consent and everyone knows the animal pornography
01:13:52 is a thriving field in australia and abroad how long are we keeping up this atrocious cringe worthy
01:14:00 podcast that i don't know we can why are we even talking about dating and stuff isn't this is the
01:14:07 we're supposed to be talking about hard things and all these fucking these hikikomori's these
01:14:12 nerds are talking about dating as if it's hard get out of here i'm talking about actual hard this
01:14:17 is why you're a chad jesse you're a totally chad on the subject of dating i'm the king of chad
01:14:23 i'm i'm chad thunder dong and all of you are beneath me
01:14:29 well some of us are sensitive men and we need a delicate approach that's hard
01:14:34 do you want to talk about a topic if yeah i could change a topic if you need a topic please
01:14:39 may it save us okay okay um what you got so most people find it hard to wake up in the mornings
01:14:46 what i find hard is to actually fall asleep i have i find both insanely difficult i cannot wake up
01:14:53 but i cannot go to sleep i'm just crap i'm definitely the opposite of you mage there i
01:14:58 have such a hard time getting up any day and like going to sleep is so easy for me i find it hard to
01:15:02 want to go to sleep because the act of sleeping is death yeah it's terrifying it's true i agree
01:15:07 completely i lay awake for seven hours until oh my god i have to yeah and i can't fall asleep
01:15:16 and it's just frustrating like i i don't have i don't get enough sleep for like days and then
01:15:21 like one day like i usually sleep for like five six hours and that's not counting uh when i keep
01:15:27 waking up between like two or three hours or so and then there's this one day i can't fall asleep
01:15:34 and then when i do fall asleep i fall asleep for like 14 hours and i've knocked out i've been there
01:15:40 and that is the work you enter the odin sleep i used to not be able to get to sleep but what has
01:15:44 helped with that now is that i don't have any schedule so i just go to bed literally only
01:15:50 when i am falling down oh my god so speaking of what i would do if i was in your position have you
01:15:55 ever heard of a polyphasic sleep cycle yes and i can't do it the sleep i want to talk about that
01:16:01 i've tried many many times to enter one of those it's not i can't do it i just sleep too long it's
01:16:07 when you sleep multiple times shortly throughout the day so you can kind of just keep going
01:16:12 continuous the holy grail is the is six 20 minute naps yes is what people say is possible sleep
01:16:20 schedule yeah but guys let me tell you because this whole not being able to wake up thing
01:16:24 is such a burden being a normie with a nine to five it's a fucking nightmare i'm so bad it
01:16:30 is the biggest problem in my life by a huge march that is my professional life me being able to wake
01:16:35 up as to why when i had my nine to five like one of the reasons i think they let me go is because
01:16:40 i couldn't wake up properly and i would be late a bunch of times and you know what it is it's
01:16:45 because i'm up late doing the thing i care about yeah no fucking making my videos you know you're
01:16:49 burning the midnight oil trying to satisfy your soul so before it gets crushed the following morning
01:16:58 yeah that's why i guess mage wants us to shut the fucking board no i'm just letting you guys know
01:17:04 because we were planning to for like half an hour and this is almost an hour now so half an hour
01:17:09 that's gonna be a short ass podcast don't we usually go more than a half that's because the
01:17:13 guys did part one because yeah davoo and hippo decided to just do a part one of this podcast
01:17:19 themselves while they were waiting for us uh so they there's already like a 30 to 45 minute
01:17:27 podcast recorded somewhere god this the the pcp is like the house of leaves of
01:17:34 it is oh my god oh hey so i mean that joke i mean i yeah yeah and i don't i'm gay i'm gay
01:17:43 um i'm sure it's come up before but this did we are did we already talk about art and how art is
01:17:50 hard no we haven't talked about the actual topic at all yet we've just talked about what they've all
01:17:56 been stuff i find hard it's just because it's stuff jesse doesn't find hard so it doesn't care jesse
01:18:01 is just art on a different level than us all right ben well what were you yeah sorry tom well
01:18:05 here's my art it's really hard that's it yeah i mean because it just takes a long time it just
01:18:11 takes a long time as hell like for sure it's like you look okay you look at a thing like like
01:18:18 brian leo malley's like my favorite one of my favorite artists you look at his art it's real
01:18:21 simple right there's not that many lines the characters are simplified you think it'd be you
01:18:26 think it would be easy to recreate but it's not it's never as easy as it looks it's it's it's like
01:18:31 it's a couple a couple of drawings are like an entire day's work even if they're simple
01:18:36 and it it's it's hard right now and i was doing okay now i'm four days behind
01:18:43 because i made this stupid tweet that's like oh the last two weeks will all be foreshortening
01:18:47 exercises let me tell you you want to talk about shit that's fucking hard foreshortening
01:18:52 is the worst thing in the world every time i foreshorten i shorten my life from the fucking
01:18:57 stress it's awful i haven't i haven't been doing i haven't been doing the everyday thing i've just
01:19:02 been occasionally doing an ink thing for you know that's art is incredibly hard specifically
01:19:09 illustration is hard and it's even more annoying because illustrators are very pompous and elitist
01:19:14 about it because if you if you dare say oh it's so hard to draw good i wish i could draw good they
01:19:20 all have the same stock response well you can draw good you just have to practice and get good at
01:19:24 it you piece of shit you're just you're just yeah yeah i i know i know that i can practice and get
01:19:29 good at it the hard part is that i'm too busy being the world's greatest comedy writer i'm busy
01:19:35 putting my effort into that to put effort into something else when i say that it's hard i'm not
01:19:39 saying that i can't get good at it i'm saying it's hard to get good at it you piece of shit you know
01:19:43 it's true oh jesse i understand it's just from from my perspective it's a little it's a little
01:19:49 grading sometimes when people look at your work and just assume that you just like i you know i
01:19:56 wish i could do that as though it's just something i was born able to do yes i never take it that way
01:20:02 i just take it like it's a result of your effort like they wish they could do that you know actually
01:20:08 i think not many people tell me this because personally i would prefer personally i would i
01:20:12 prefer people to assume it's something i was born able to do i like when people assume that i'm just
01:20:17 a superior breed of human and it's pointless to try to measure up yeah that's greatly satisfying me
01:20:22 so actually never mind i apologize for any time i've said anything like that i take it back that's
01:20:27 just the real that's the source of all difficulty is that there's just not enough time in a human
01:20:31 lifespan to do all the stuff that you want to do i've spent my whole life getting good at one
01:20:36 particular set of skills so if someone fucking kidnaps my daughter and says you have to make a
01:20:41 good youtube video i can tell them that i have this particular set of skills but anything else i just
01:20:47 can't do it all and i hate myself for not having the time to devote myself to getting good at speaking
01:20:52 of time do you ever think about that they're like higher dimensional beings where time is just like
01:20:56 as fluid as i hope so and i hope to become one of them someday and i get really pissed off that
01:21:01 i'm like limited by my well now hang on because me being without without a perception of time
01:21:08 as we have now a cause and effect kind of becomes meaningless and nothing that you do really is an
01:21:12 achievement at all you know it just it always was that way so really only because we view time in
01:21:18 this way do our actions have the kind of value we perceive them to have yeah but i'd rather but i'm
01:21:23 talking about should be rather just be god mode oh right easy or easiness jokes and something deep
01:21:29 and philosophical just tom's right though we have to give up uh self uh congratulatory right urges
01:21:37 if we just make everything easy you know if it's easy you're not going to get any satisfaction
01:21:41 for it but at least you're getting it done that's true and from a limited time three dimensional
01:21:46 being trapped in the coils of an ever moving forward time space mm-hmm that's the best we can
01:21:53 ever hope for vote vote prop eight to turn to turn time into uh a flowing a river that we can
01:22:01 flow through at our own whim instead of an onward progression vote vote that up as the biggest
01:22:06 solution in the universe let's talk about the actual hardest thing in the universe the thing
01:22:12 that's so really um um is it is it is it uh we already made the my dick joe we already said
01:22:19 that yeah we did we did okay okay i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry the actual thing
01:22:25 that was really what you're good okay i don't i don't fucking know what i was gonna say the hardest
01:22:31 thing that i don't believe anyone can ever actually get good at unless they were fucking you know
01:22:36 fucking forced to get good at it from the age of like two years old is playing an instrument
01:22:42 in also ballet i guess but playing an instrument is the most impossible thing in the world
01:22:47 i've been at the same level of guitar playing for like 15 years i haven't progressed at all
01:22:53 i'm just i'm just like barely competent and it's been that way since for for over a decade i never
01:22:59 get any better because i never have the time or the patience to go okay today's the day that i
01:23:03 would sign up for guitar lessons and fucking also piano lessons and all of them the fucking trumpet
01:23:08 wasn't this the time problem again though is that i'll come back to well i mean yeah yeah but i'm
01:23:11 specific jesse i actually found on how i hate that specific problem because i ran into i hit that
01:23:17 wall about five years ago where i was like i'm never gonna learn how to play an instrument you
01:23:21 know i'd spent i'm not hitting that wall i'll never accept it i spent i spent most of my childhood
01:23:26 in my teen years thinking i was gonna do you know one of these days i'm gonna learn to play that
01:23:31 fucking guitar that fucking bass or those fucking drums i got all of them i got a keyboard you know
01:23:36 don't know how to play any of them and then one day i was like this is never gonna happen and then i
01:23:40 found the best solution surround yourself with people who can play instruments then you can just
01:23:46 pretend that their accomplishments are your accomplishments by singing and then posting them
01:23:52 on your bandcamp and therefore they are your songs because nobody wants to actually associate
01:24:00 themselves with the songs that you've sung over because you've sung about penises and cocks
01:24:04 and so they're like yeah whatever that's your bandcamp bro have fun and i'm like ha ha yes
01:24:11 i have made music even though all i've done is screech about penises and cocks over someone
01:24:17 else's institution digi you are an art criminal that's a good stage name art well you know the
01:24:27 problem is that i just i guess i hold myself to a high standard because i picture myself in the
01:24:33 future as like some worldly renaissance man who can do everything and so everything that i'm not
01:24:39 currently good at i hate myself for and i want to die you know i view myself more as like the wild
01:24:46 stallions as in my art will unite all of mankind and bring us into a glorious new age you know i
01:24:51 think that's going to happen one of these days yeah that's right and i think self perceptions
01:24:56 is pretty hard because then you have these standards you have to live up to that makes life way more
01:25:02 difficult as opposed to like i'm just going to do whatever and whatever happens happens but no
01:25:06 oh here's my here's that you know on that subject my okay um my inktober drawing i mean i was talking
01:25:13 about how art is hard and tom you were saying that you know you've been you've been challenging
01:25:17 yourself with your inktober's and they've been hard for you um let me for me my inktober things
01:25:22 have all been stuff that i go into with no plan and i just like and i just like put down marks
01:25:27 whatever and it becomes whatever it's going to become and it has they have not been hard they
01:25:32 have all they have all just been whatever kind of came naturally because i wasn't trying for any
01:25:36 particular goal with them and they all came out great and i'm really happy with them so
01:25:40 there i'm sure there's a lesson to be learned somewhere in that story but i don't know what it
01:25:44 is called stop trying trying just trying just sets you up for failure if you just do whatever
01:25:49 you can't fail because you have no idea what you were supposed to do to succeed
01:25:55 yeah if you just do what comes you know what is a uniquely podcast on such a great inspirational
01:26:02 quote from tom oliver oh well cool all right i mean are we actually done i don't know does anybody
01:26:14 have let me let me bring up one more thing and i just that i've thought of as you were saying
01:26:19 that it's just a uh a youtuber specific thing that is kind of just true of all artists is
01:26:24 when you've made your work and you've got like your channel whatever and you have a certain level
01:26:29 of quality that you have uh made things and you know it creates an expectation in yourself and
01:26:35 possibly your audience it's hard to know what they're thinking uh to deliver on that same
01:26:39 standard which leads to everyone making a secondary channel where they post their
01:26:43 shit that isn't good enough in their own mind to be on their main channel uh you know just living
01:26:49 up to your own standards is what i'm saying as an artist as a youtuber as anything is uh
01:26:54 this stuff because who who who's the toughest guy that you got to fight in your box and ring
01:26:59 it's yourself it's your own demons you gotta you gotta punch that boy pow pow that's it that's
01:27:08 my motivational speech for the day you gotta punch i mean i the toughest the toughest guy that
01:27:14 rocky had to fight was actually apollo creed not not himself and well you you say that no you say
01:27:20 he had to fight that russian dude who was like he had to fight that was definitely the toughest
01:27:25 oh i haven't yet apollo creed and then the next guy club around kicked his ass so the person he
01:27:30 had to overcome to stay the champion was himself because i mean this is basic that causes down
