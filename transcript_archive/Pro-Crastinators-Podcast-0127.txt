00:00:00 Oh my fucking god, you're still listening to The Pro Crastinators Podcast in 2018.
00:00:28 It's me Digibro, and I'm joined by good ol' boy's best guy ever.
00:00:36 Microphone Jones is over, so please excuse the noise in the background.
00:00:41 We've got The Davoo.
00:00:45 I recently watched FLCL Progressive, and in one part someone says, you need to become
00:00:50 a pro, and he was like, what kind of pro?
00:00:53 I don't know, you gotta decide what kind of pro you wanna be.
00:00:56 And I thought, a crastinator pro?
00:00:59 And then the song started playing in my head.
00:01:02 I wanted to yell to him over the screen, become a pro crastinator.
00:01:08 We've got Tom Oliver.
00:01:12 I am here, and I am queer.
00:01:16 And you are games.
00:01:17 And we've got Munchy.
00:01:19 Wait, you're telling me it's not 2015, and we have Oliver and integrity intact still,
00:01:24 and the PCP hasn't just started a couple months ago, and it's so still gone?
00:01:31 What?
00:01:32 Wait, is this show starting 2015?
00:01:35 I don't think that's accurate.
00:01:37 That can't be right.
00:01:38 We can't be doing this for three fucking years.
00:01:39 The first episode was the very end of 2015, so it will soon become three years.
00:01:44 Oh my god.
00:01:45 Oh my god.
00:01:46 Well, it's now an unstructured clusterfuck, like it was always meant to be.
00:01:54 Does anybody have a subject that is burning through their mind, or should I just start
00:01:59 us right off?
00:02:00 Start us right off.
00:02:01 Pop culture is bad.
00:02:02 Go for it.
00:02:03 Yeah, I'm going to talk about, let's talk about how pop culture is bad.
00:02:07 And I don't mean anything, like any individual piece of media is bad, or that people's tastes
00:02:14 are bad.
00:02:15 In fact, I think that people's tastes are a lot better than pop culture.
00:02:21 But what I think pop culture is, is like a filtration system that just puts everybody
00:02:28 to the same things.
00:02:30 But I don't think it's inherent to people that they like that stuff.
00:02:36 What do you guys think?
00:02:37 Yeah.
00:02:38 Well, what's inherent to people, I think, is that they gravitate to the most popular
00:02:41 thing, because it's the most discussed.
00:02:43 Right.
00:02:44 So I think it's just a natural process of people's interaction, and discussing media
00:02:48 and stuff.
00:02:49 The thing is that it's so easy to control.
00:02:53 Like, for instance, with music, I was just watching some analysis video called, When
00:02:58 Soundtracks Repeat Themselves, and it wasn't saying anything I hadn't already known, but
00:03:04 just hearing it reaffirmed by quoting a science book made it like, man, it really made me
00:03:12 think about it.
00:03:13 In fact, people literally, literally like something more, like a song more, because
00:03:19 they hear it multiple times.
00:03:22 Like the more times you hear something.
00:03:24 You're saying this piece of information was more impactful because you heard it again,
00:03:28 A.K.A. multiple times.
00:03:29 Exactly.
00:03:30 Yeah.
00:03:31 Well, I mean, and it wasn't even that I'd heard it before, it's more that I just implicitly
00:03:35 knew this, but like, just knowing that a scientist person had put it in science words
00:03:41 in an academic book somewhere, like she literally was like, yeah, if you hear something again,
00:03:49 you just like it more, because you'll internalize it more, you'll think about it more.
00:03:54 And this is why when a new song comes out that the radio stations think could be a number
00:03:59 one hit, they just play it all day and hope that it works.
00:04:05 They're just like, here, listen to this song every hour on the hour, and you just are going
00:04:11 to end up liking it because you hear it so many times.
00:04:13 Is this applied to everything or just songs?
00:04:16 I mean, I think that anything you hear it probably applies to.
00:04:20 If we watch Sword Art Online enough, will it be good?
00:04:24 I've argued that before.
00:04:25 You'll probably develop a familiarity and thus like a comfort with it.
00:04:30 What about FLCL Progressive?
00:04:32 Can that become good?
00:04:33 Oh, God.
00:04:34 You have to put yourself in the process of watching it again.
00:04:37 I was a pop culture.
00:04:39 Do you mean just art?
00:04:41 Do you mean movies and video games and songs by pop culture?
00:04:45 I mean anything popular.
00:04:47 I think that popularity is an engine that perpetuates itself not on the basis of what
00:04:53 people like, but on the basis of what someone wants people to like.
00:04:58 Bludgeoning yourself with it over the head till you like it.
00:05:01 Just last night, I was having a conversation at the round table about Fairy Tale, to which
00:05:09 one of my conversants said, oh yeah, I didn't like it until around 50 episodes in, to which
00:05:18 the wife came up and said, see, even if that's true, I have to watch 50 episodes to get to
00:05:24 that point.
00:05:25 And I just sort of mumbled Stockholm Syndrome under my breath.
00:05:28 I don't know, man.
00:05:29 I hear that shit all the time about those long running shounens.
00:05:33 People will say, oh, once you get 40 episodes in, it gets really good.
00:05:38 The fact that you even made it 40 episodes in means that your thought process is so fundamentally
00:05:44 different from mine.
00:05:45 I'll tell you that I can't believe that it actually gets good.
00:05:48 The shonen that I watched that totally changed my perspective on all of fiction was called
00:05:54 The Pretender from 1998 to 2002.
00:05:58 It's one of those shounens that are from America and are live action.
00:06:01 And it's about a guy who's super autistic and has genius capacity.
00:06:06 He was locked up his whole life, but he has the ability to, in the first episode, he just
00:06:10 reads a medical book and then can just go and be a fucking doctor now.
00:06:14 That's how good he is at simulation, which is a cool premise, just like any good shonen.
00:06:20 And it's got some very archetypical but likable characters, just like any good shonen.
00:06:26 But it was written terribly.
00:06:28 The same shit happens all the time.
00:06:30 It does things where it'll build up like, oh, his long lost brother for half a season
00:06:33 and then he dies immediately, and then the next season they build up, oh, he's actually
00:06:36 returning, he's not dead, then he actually dies for real.
00:06:39 So it's like, it's horrible, it's tedious, it wasted four seasons of watching, and at
00:06:44 the end of it all I was like, I didn't gain anything from this.
00:06:47 I like the character, I don't need to know what happens to him, he's not fucking real!
00:06:53 Stories aren't real, and if they're frustrating you, fuck them.
00:06:57 Fuck those sympathetic characters you like for the sin of being in a shitty story.
00:07:01 Dump the story.
00:07:02 I was probably like 13, and ever since then my mentality has been, fuck a story!
00:07:09 I feel like I had a recent example of this thing, which is, just the other day, me and
00:07:16 I was, I don't know why, but I thought about Cromartie High School, and I'm like, Michelle,
00:07:21 do you want to watch Cromartie High School?
00:07:23 And she was like, okay, sure.
00:07:25 In my mind I was going through all these loop-de-loops about thinking about how this is the best
00:07:30 show ever.
00:07:31 I'm telling you, this is the funniest show ever, it's the best comedy, it's one of those
00:07:36 anime that reminds you why anime is worth existing, and then we proceeded to watch it.
00:07:41 We watched like four episodes, and I loved it because I love all the characters and I
00:07:48 know everybody there, and there were some great jokes, like in the very first couple
00:07:51 minutes when the guy just eats the pencils, like that's hilarious.
00:07:55 But I got a distinct depression that like, huh, these episodes are not as funny as I
00:08:00 remember them being.
00:08:02 I'm enjoying them, but I can sense that this isn't going over as like literally the funniest
00:08:08 thing of all time.
00:08:09 That's so bad when you show something to someone, and they're just kinda like, they're
00:08:13 watching it, they aren't seeing anything, but you know, the aura is changed.
00:08:18 The aura, the aura is there, and like, I felt like, okay, I think that there are better
00:08:23 episodes later or something, but I was still thinking like, this is so far not exactly
00:08:28 lived up to what I thought.
00:08:29 It's really funny, Nate, because Chromarty High School was a show that was pitched to
00:08:33 me kinda like that, and when I watched it, I really thought of it as like a 50-50 kind
00:08:38 of show.
00:08:39 Like, half of it is unbelievably hilarious, the other half is just okay, and like, but
00:08:46 there's this amazing line-
00:08:47 I still buy it though, it's still the best show ever made.
00:08:50 It's still, I mean, it's really memorable because it's so different, because there's
00:08:53 not another comedy show that feels like it, and so if you just like that feel, and like
00:08:58 you remember the great scenes, then it's like, that's enough.
00:09:01 There's a fucking phenomenal quote from the Watchmen that I love bringing up, towards
00:09:07 the very end, where throughout the whole story, Silk Spector, I think that was the younger,
00:09:13 the girl, right?
00:09:14 Yeah, the lady.
00:09:15 That was the young lady.
00:09:16 She's like, she's, you know, always been like traumatized by the fact that her mom
00:09:20 was like, raped by the comedian, and in the end, her mom is like, kind of like, she's
00:09:27 kind of nostalgic about him, and kind of like forgiving, and Silk Spector's like, what the
00:09:32 fuck?
00:09:33 Like, he raped you.
00:09:34 Like, how could you feel this way?
00:09:35 And she says, like, you know, as you get older, and you know, everything's changing,
00:09:40 and all the people who you care about start dying, like, you just look back, and you don't
00:09:44 really fixate on the bad stuff, all the bad memories are replaced with bright lights, as
00:09:50 she says it.
00:09:51 And I see this in people all the time, especially if your life is, if you're going through something
00:09:58 rough, if your life feels worse than it once felt, then like, you will over glamorize the
00:10:03 past.
00:10:04 You'll remember all the best things that happened, and you'll be like, oh man, I was so much
00:10:08 happier when I was this, in this state, like, if only I could get back there, but then you
00:10:14 remember like, oh wait, that's right, there was tons of bullshit, you know, and I think
00:10:19 people feel that way about media too, where you just, and I think because I've kind of
00:10:25 known about this, I've always tried to avoid it.
00:10:27 Like, I always try to remember exactly how I felt at a time and preserve the memory of
00:10:32 how I felt rather than my memory of the thing itself.
00:10:36 So like, with Chromarty, I remember exactly the fact that it was like, I thought it was
00:10:41 50, 50, half the funniest thing ever, half not, and that's the memory I've preserved
00:10:45 above everything else.
00:10:48 And then if I watch it again, I can be surprised or reaffirmed, but like, yeah, I do think
00:10:54 that it's why we, it's why nostalgia is so powerful, you know, like nobody remembers
00:11:00 the bad episodes of the stuff that they watched, and especially this is why people will always
00:11:05 think that modern media is worse than older media, because when you think back, you're
00:11:09 only going to remember the shows you actually finished or the ones that stuck out, like
00:11:13 all the dumb generic bullshit just goes by the wayside and nobody talks about it anymore,
00:11:19 so it doesn't stay alive in your memory.
00:11:21 But there was always just as much dumb generic bullshit as there is, you know?
00:11:27 Yeah, more or less.
00:11:28 Percentages-wise, anyway.
00:11:29 I mean, people will sometimes look at certain mediums and like run up stats of what people
00:11:35 are enjoying, and it does come in peaks and troughs.
00:11:37 I think generally people would say the turn of the last decade from 08 to 12 or so, you
00:11:44 know, that was the club shit era, and people tend to be more favorable of pop music right
00:11:50 now in comparison.
00:11:52 But also, people talk about-
00:11:53 I mean, it really depends on who you ask, because when you look at Todd in the shadows
00:11:56 and like, he really thought that last year was like the worst year of pop music.
00:12:01 Oh, really?
00:12:02 Yeah.
00:12:03 Because that's why I found your series, Digi, legitimately fascinating.
00:12:06 And you, like, when you like, you tried to basically mathematically prove that I think
00:12:10 it was that like 2007 was like the best year of anime, like based on like reviews and stuff.
00:12:15 And that's like a useful thing.
00:12:17 I mean, by really analyzing daily, you can be like, are things actually getting better
00:12:21 or not or, you know, whatever?
00:12:22 The thing about that video, though, is that I may have empirically proved that 2007 is
00:12:28 the best- what I really proved is that four like Western anime fans' consensus 2007 is
00:12:34 the best year.
00:12:35 But the reason why that's the case is that 2007 is the year that speed subbing really
00:12:40 took off.
00:12:41 So for most people, that was the first year they were watching anime while it came out
00:12:45 in Japan.
00:12:46 Myself included.
00:12:47 Like, that was the first year where I was watching seasonal shows.
00:12:51 And like, at the time, a lot of shows were, you know, still getting subbed really slowly.
00:12:55 Like it wasn't like everything got subtitled back then.
00:12:58 What caused that?
00:12:59 Did Haruhi cause that?
00:13:00 Or was it Lucky Star?
00:13:01 It was Naruto.
00:13:02 Naruto caused speed subbing.
00:13:05 Throughout the 2000s, there were sub groups who were basically competing with each other
00:13:09 to see who could sub it as fast as possible.
00:13:12 So Naruto was the first show, I think, that ever had fansubs like day one of an episode
00:13:17 coming out.
00:13:18 And then the fact that Torrenting got popular and Torrenting was by far the safest and easiest
00:13:23 way to download stuff.
00:13:25 So it was like, between that and also streaming sites were getting bigger.
00:13:29 You had sites like Crunchyroll that were taking in, like they had- Crunchyroll used
00:13:33 to have fucking everything.
00:13:34 Like, anything that had been subtitled was on there.
00:13:37 YouTube had a lot of shows at the time.
00:13:39 Back when they were good old pirate boys and didn't have their squeaky clean image.
00:13:44 What did For Never World say about them?
00:13:45 They're a clean company.
00:13:46 They're a clean company.
00:13:47 That's hilarious.
00:13:48 I love that.
00:13:51 They were literally the dirtiest of all those fucking streaming sites because you had to
00:13:55 pay for a subscription to full screen your video.
00:13:58 How come we can shit on- It's okay to run James Gunn out of the business for saying
00:14:04 some fucked up jokes about baby rape.
00:14:06 But it's not okay to shit on Crunchyroll for being the worst actual pirates in the game
00:14:13 back in the day.
00:14:14 I went to Disneyland recently on every single roller coaster at the height of the coast
00:14:18 before it dropped.
00:14:19 I said hire James Gunn as loud as I could.
00:14:24 It was the most effective marketing campaign of all time.
00:14:27 On the Matterhorn, I had the abominable snowman that was going to come out and get you.
00:14:30 I kept going over to my friend Kyle behind me and I'm like, dude, that's James Gunn.
00:14:33 He's going to try and swipe you up.
00:14:34 He's really mad.
00:14:35 He wants to contract that Kyle.
00:14:36 He's going to make the contract.
00:14:38 It's the only job that had left.
00:14:39 He gets into the abominable snowman costume, runs around.
00:14:42 That's where Disney puts all their rejects so they can stop the abominable snowman costume.
00:14:46 They force him to characterize people.
00:14:48 This is what your tweets have done to people.
00:14:50 Now they act it act physically and now you can see the damage you've done.
00:14:54 Oh boy.
00:14:55 Yeah, I think it was a combination of Naruto and Torrance making speed something possible
00:15:00 and then yes, the hype around Haruhi, but early 2007 Gurren Lagann came out and that
00:15:07 was subbed within the week every episode and Code Geass was also really huge at that time.
00:15:15 So I'm thinking it was those two where I think Code Geass probably even more because Gurren
00:15:19 Lagann was like a slow burn before it got popular.
00:15:22 That's true.
00:15:23 Geass before Gurren Lagann.
00:15:24 Yeah, Geass was a huge meme on A and everything so I think it was that and so yeah, I think
00:15:32 a lot of people are really nostalgic for that era and also it depends on genre because
00:15:37 most anime fans in the West get into it or at least they used to get into it because
00:15:42 of action shows and the mid-2000s was when action shows were the most prominent genre
00:15:48 in anime and then as it sort of drifted over into cute girl shit and comedies and isekai
00:15:54 and light novel adaptations, it's like people who really miss that certain style are kind
00:16:00 of ass out now and so that's kind of how it was with Gigak with his whole golden year
00:16:05 of anime which was what inspired me to make that video was that he was reminiscing on
00:16:10 this certain era that he considered the best but it's entirely because of what was popular
00:16:15 during that era just happening to resonate with him.
00:16:19 But anyway, my real problem with pop culture is that it's not even so much that the wrong
00:16:26 things get promoted or that they get promoted for the wrong reasons, it's that it hampers
00:16:32 people's ability to find what they will like because I think that the average consumer
00:16:38 actually has a much broader taste than they probably give themselves credit for and like
00:16:43 if you talk to almost anybody, they probably have something they really love that you wouldn't
00:16:50 expect because maybe it just came on one night when they were watching TV and flipping through
00:16:56 channels or like a friend showed it to them or there's just something particular that
00:17:01 this person is way into that's not on the radio and it's not like a best seller or anything,
00:17:07 they just found it and loved it and I think most average people have that but like most
00:17:14 people don't go out of their way to look for media to consume, it's not really something
00:17:19 that is encouraged by our culture because most of us are just going to go see the things
00:17:24 that everyone's talking about so we can be in the conversation.
00:17:27 When you're trying to fuck Stacy Rottencroch down the lane, you only need to know about
00:17:31 the latest season of Game of Thrones, you don't need to know about Psycho Pass season
00:17:37 two and why it's shitty compared to season one or whatever.
00:17:42 The most fucked part is that literally seeing, I think that going beyond music, going beyond
00:17:47 anything, I think that people will respond more to something just because they have seen
00:17:51 the name before.
00:17:54 Not even that they've seen the show, just the name because like so many things that
00:18:00 Shenmue is the perfect fucking example because Shenmue was like this fucking obscure Dreamcast
00:18:07 title, people treat it like it's this beloved classic.
00:18:12 Only when the revival became a thing did I suddenly hear everybody really excited about
00:18:16 Shenmue which very much surprised me.
00:18:18 Because Shenmue 1 and 2 not only, they didn't really review all that well at the time, they're
00:18:26 not like important classic games, they just introduced new things that hadn't been seen
00:18:31 before.
00:18:32 Is it the same way as like God Hand was like hated when it came out but has like become
00:18:36 a classic since then?
00:18:38 Is that what happened to Shenmue?
00:18:39 I think that, well with God Hand it was a case of if you love platinum games, people
00:18:45 have gone back and played God Hand because it's all mechanics and that actually brings
00:18:50 me to part of this because part of what inspired me to bring up this topic was Shinobi which
00:18:54 Tom did a playthrough of that we live streamed and then we did a video about it.
00:19:00 Shinobi is a game that got like 7 out of 10 reviews across the board and like generally
00:19:06 was not praised as like this amazing game but when you play it it's clear that the game
00:19:11 is like it's borderline perfect at what it's supposed to be like if you're somebody who
00:19:18 likes like hardcore arcade style games this game is for you and you will love it.
00:19:25 But because of the fact that magazines would not see that as for everybody they're not
00:19:31 going to give it a super high score they're going to give it a 7 because they're like
00:19:34 oh well people most people are going to be disappointed with this game so if we give
00:19:38 it a 10 and everybody rushes out and buys it they're going to complain that it was too
00:19:42 hard.
00:19:43 I know I talk about this all the time but this is exactly the issue I always bring up
00:19:46 about how like super bunny hops reviews like 100% Metal Gear Solid 5 that's for a specific
00:19:52 audience somebody else could review the same game being like I played 10 hours it was really
00:19:57 fun then threw it away that's the right review for somebody else.
00:20:01 Everybody needs to be clear what their review is for like if you're going to review something
00:20:06 be like look here's who I am here's how I feel about games in general here's what this
00:20:11 game means to me because anytime you try to make it for a general audience you kind of
00:20:15 fuck over everybody because the only games that get 10s are the ones where they're like
00:20:19 oh we think everyone will love this game and the only reason you would think that is that
00:20:25 other games that are popular are similar and this is why every game that gets like high
00:20:29 review scores is the same fucking game.
00:20:32 I know if it's a fool's errand if it's literally impossible I feel like we could make a change
00:20:38 here.
00:20:39 Well I think so.
00:20:40 I think the problem is that like traditionally like to talk about game reviews in particular
00:20:44 because that's what I'm most familiar with like growing up reading EGM and GamePro and
00:20:48 all that shit like those were just magazines designed for anybody who's into games no matter
00:20:53 their taste to pick up so they had to just like write them for everyone because they
00:20:58 had no control over it the interesting thing about YouTube and like us doing reviews like
00:21:01 a singular person is you're not a big media company so you can be like I'm going to make
00:21:06 reviews for X kind of person who shares my particular taste you know that gives us the
00:21:10 freedom to really craft a review with a specific focus as opposed to like a game magazine.
00:21:16 I think that those game magazines were wrong headed to do that in the first place though
00:21:19 because they're trying to predict what they think people like and care about and like
00:21:24 I think that you just need to be honest about it because for instance a great example of
00:21:29 something where I think that this that it got saved by reviews taking the opposite stance
00:21:35 is the Souls series because when Demon Souls came out obviously that's a pretty hardcore
00:21:41 game not everybody was going to love it but GameSpot gave that their game of the year
00:21:47 they were like Demon Souls is fucking perfect if this is your type of game this is exactly
00:21:51 what you need go get this and the the like groundswell of recognition surrounding that
00:21:58 that game because everybody who played it was like this is the fucking sick of shit
00:22:01 ever so then when Dark Souls came out all of those people were like really talking about
00:22:06 and they wouldn't shut up about it and like that made it able to be successful and it's
00:22:10 like now the Souls games are like millions selling you know it's a it's a huge game
00:22:15 franchise even though like nobody would tell you oh this will appeal to everyone but guess
00:22:21 what most people are willing to bend their tastes a little bit if they hear that it's
00:22:27 supposed to be good then they will try to engage a little harder so if you give Shinobi
00:22:32 a 7 out of 10 and you're like you know it's too hard for most people they're gonna play
00:22:38 it and they're gonna go oh it's too hard I can't get into it but if you give it a 10
00:22:42 out of 10 and then someone picks it up and they're like this game is really fucking hard
00:22:46 but I know it's supposed to be a masterpiece which means that it's probably my fault I'm
00:22:50 not understanding it I'm gonna try harder basically we're all sheep and we need to be
00:22:55 led like cattle I was just gonna say Tom I think the problem here is the allure of the
00:23:03 just x out of 10 generic rating scale and the simplicity of it is so powerful that and
00:23:09 it's so to like a useful metric for people to not have to like look any further than
00:23:13 just that that you're you're really fighting an uphill battle trying to get people to like
00:23:18 think as a teenager I always felt bad for okay come on read the review this time read
00:23:24 the review this time be literary god damn it ah numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers
00:23:29 fuck again why am I paying for this but looking back as someone who's written reviews
00:23:35 other reviews were shitty and boring I was averting my eyes from literary filth from wasted
00:23:41 brain cells still to this day I mostly look at review scores with those magazines because when
00:23:47 I try to read them like I get game informer sent to my house and like I just give them the scores
00:23:53 and what I'm looking for is what got under a seven because anything that gets under a seven a
00:23:58 game informer is like unplayable I was like recently nothing gets under a seven if I became
00:24:04 like if I if my career I switched it to making documentaries I would make like my magnum opus
00:24:11 a documentary called the IGN seven about and it would start by just talking about IGN and its
00:24:17 culture of you know the whole cultural idea of anything less than the seven is bad but that
00:24:22 just means that it's this weird way of looking at the world and I very slowly start to pan out to
00:24:27 the rest of media and how we think of us out of a seven and then I slowly spiral out to seven out
00:24:33 of ten being the mindset that holds back all of human progress this idea that we need to chase
00:24:41 what we see as good but what is good is actually just mediocre I'm gonna finally break it down
00:24:45 right now what the IGN seven actually means because I think that the reality is when IGN
00:24:52 gives something a 10 or a nine it's because they think everyone in their audience will enjoy it
00:24:57 when they give it a seven it's because they know someone in their audience this is their favorite
00:25:02 game but not enough and when they give something less than a seven it means it's actually a bad
00:25:07 game so like the seven out of ten it's such a it's such a weird milk toast middle rating because
00:25:12 like for instance jrpg's they if you look at review scores in any major publication you will
00:25:19 never see a jrpg get a 10 no matter what the absolute the ones that are considered like the
00:25:26 greatest of all time might get like a nine to a nine point two five and the ones that are like
00:25:34 really good will get like an eight to an eight point five and the ones that are like jrpg
00:25:40 fans will like it will get a seven and it would have to be like broken and unplayable to get below
00:25:45 a seven but like that's all the mindset is it's just like seven out of ten means play it if you're
00:25:51 into this genre eight out of ten means like you know definitely play it if you're into this genre
00:25:56 nine out of ten means if you care about rpg's this will be your your new magnum opus but like it
00:26:00 will never get a 10 even if it is legitimately one of the best games ever made just because it's a
00:26:06 jrpg and like they know that most people won't play it um but i just think it's wrongheaded
00:26:11 because i think there was a time when jrpg's could be the greatest game of all time and there's no
00:26:17 reason we couldn't get back there so like for for magazines to try to instead of just saying like
00:26:23 this game's a 10 out of 10 let's make a cultural shift and and go back to appreciating jrpg's
00:26:29 instead they just say well we can't give it a 10 because this is not a popular genre it doesn't
00:26:35 matter if persona five sells as well as a you know major title i think for for game informer in
00:26:41 particular they also have like another reason for never giving below a seven and i think it's just
00:26:46 because like they're owned by game stop and like games off they want to sell games so if they give
00:26:52 the more games they give seven or higher the more like titles they have to sell at their stores
00:26:58 the conversation shifted a little bit but that's why i look sorry i just want to say that's why i
00:27:03 like looking at the ones that get under a seven because it's when it's like so bad they won't
00:27:07 even shill it they're like because they know that if you go buy this game it's gonna make
00:27:12 game stop look bad for selling it to you you know to go back to the the idea of like like top 40 and
00:27:20 you know popular movies and stuff like that are we being cynical or are the people who are flocking
00:27:26 into these things just genuine fans because i have a i have a friend who i didn't know could exist until
00:27:32 i met him and this person is just a diehard honest to god like he loves marvel movies he just
00:27:38 wants to see them with all of his life and he has a ton of friends who are the same i i i've
00:27:43 sort of cracked into the the norm a lot of my friends are like that yeah so who are we to say
00:27:48 that they are not enjoying them and they're just kind of being i'm not saying that at all i i think
00:27:53 those movies are legitimately good for the most part and i definitely think the reason that like
00:27:59 the avengers movies get such like absolutely insane ratings is partly this it's that it keeps
00:28:05 coming back up so people get used to it and and they want to be a part of it because it's like an
00:28:10 ongoing narrative but it's not that i don't think people would naturally watch those movies it's
00:28:15 the problem is that it takes them away from everything else it's that it's that we're siphoning
00:28:21 people into just a few places and like sort of being like hey you know this is a thing you recognize
00:28:27 go look at it again and again and again and it's like there's no attempt to make people
00:28:32 go to something they don't aren't already comfortable with you know but i think most
00:28:37 people would you know most people would like something that they're not comfortable with
00:28:42 they just need to be showing it and like you know co-recently went out i didn't go but she went
00:28:48 with like i think her mom or her friend or whatever and watched crazy rich asians don't
00:28:51 think it's a movie i would like but she came home and she was like almost a different person
00:28:57 for about 36 hours she was so happy she was just she was simply filled with energy and vigor
00:29:06 more than she usually is and i was like damn man and that's what people out what i don't know it was
00:29:13 just a movie that she liked a lot you know i think that i think a lot of people um like the stuff
00:29:19 that people tend to say is their favorite is rarely the one that is the super big popular
00:29:25 tentpole media because everyone likes that thing but it's made you know it's made to appeal to
00:29:32 everyone and like most people whatever is their number one favorite is something that is more
00:29:39 you know true to their their them personally but like most people aren't like me where they've
00:29:45 gone out and like watched everything in the effort of finding that one thing that appeals to them most
00:29:51 most people it's like they happened upon one thing like yeah and you see this a lot with newer anime
00:29:58 fans where it's like whatever is their favorite is usually something they saw in like the first
00:30:02 10 shows they watched and it like blew them away and it could be something that like they're like oh
00:30:08 my god like it's online a good example like because even though it's huge like you know on a world
00:30:14 scale when you think about it as an individual person living it in the world like most people
00:30:20 haven't heard of sword art online so like like average joe so like when someone finds out about it
00:30:26 from their friend who's like dude you gotta watch this show sword art online and then they watch it
00:30:31 never having seen anime before never having seen a show about being trapped in an mmo never having
00:30:36 seen a show about like a death game never having seen a show with you know with this or that element
00:30:42 maybe even just a fan service that they're very young and they're sexually you know like they're
00:30:46 just starting to feel you know sexually like awakened and then they see this like really
00:30:51 raunchy shit and they're like whoa my dick is exploding like that's the kind of shit that will
00:30:56 make people say like oh my god this is my favorite show i can't believe it and then like someone like
00:31:00 me who's literally watched 10 000 of the same exact thing but better is like oh boy you know but i
00:31:07 totally understand why people like it it's just a matter of like when i see those people i just want
00:31:12 to say well let me entreat you to to to some more let me show you there's an endless world of things
00:31:20 out there that might appeal to you even more specifically because everybody's a little bit
00:31:24 different and so there's probably something that appeals to every individual person a little
00:31:30 differently from everybody else around them you know that's true it's just that most people don't
00:31:34 give a shit right not like not even close and for most people i think about my dad for example
00:31:41 my dad watches and i know that he's not the typical yet but like this will be like when our
00:31:45 generation becomes dads like that'll be us then and then it'll be you know the next year blah blah
00:31:50 like he couldn't give less of a shit about like like what would my dad ends up watching is like
00:31:56 like fox 24 style shows like crime dramas you know and like like real world stuff that he can
00:32:04 he like he like gets it he's like ah yes i understand what this is and like he'll watch the
00:32:09 stuff that falls into his lap and now that there's like Netflix and the on-demand stuff like it's
00:32:14 easier for him to like to find those things and watch more but like he is not i mean he's not
00:32:19 going on youtube this will change slightly as as youtube like takes over more and like i think that
00:32:24 like tom was saying more personal tastes we'll be able to permeate just as like it's not one monolith
00:32:29 now that controls everything but more smaller voices that reach more people let me let me expand
00:32:34 this beyond just media because it supplies to everything in culture a huge one is food and it's
00:32:40 really funny to me that they're like nobody comes out the pussy with a specific preference for food
00:32:46 like probably not if you're american and all you eat is american food it's because all you've eaten
00:32:51 is american food you grew up with it you're used to people who only want to eat hamburgers that that
00:32:57 marvel movie friend is just like that all i want to do is eat hamburgers and just have the meat
00:33:01 the the cheese the bun interesting to use like that yeah like and i i know a lot of people like
00:33:07 that who who won't even go to like a restaurant from like you know you say oh let's try out this
00:33:14 tie place and they're like oh like what is a i don't know about that and it's like it's the same
00:33:19 fucking thing they first of all there's only like six animals we actually eat on this goddamn planet
00:33:25 they eat the same shit everywhere they just cook it slightly differently with a with a few extra
00:33:29 peppers like you'll be fine go to the fucking tie place i okay i i i am a picky eater i was a picky
00:33:37 eater ever since i was a kid so i sympathize with but ever like like recently i was okay much i was
00:33:42 a picky eater too it's not it's not hard i'm gonna pick up new cultures of food it's not it's not
00:33:48 dude right okay or these good restaurants and figure out if you do like Thai food or whatever
00:33:53 right i grew up as a super fucking picky eater as a kid all i ate was like macaroni and kid
00:33:59 cuisines and like i was raised on garbage like outright garbage food and it wasn't until like
00:34:04 my late teens when i just because of the fact that i was applying this logic to anime that like
00:34:11 in my early days watching anime all i liked was action shows and shit like that and then
00:34:15 when i got introduced to like cute girls shows because that was kind of the zeitgeist in the
00:34:19 late 2000 and i started liking that it made me able to start exploring and like the first time i
00:34:25 watched like princess tutu for instance i was like this is way too girly i can't sit do something this
00:34:30 girly and then like gradually i got into girly or shows through like hard catch pre-care because it
00:34:36 has cool action scenes in it and then it acclimates you and then at some point you're like it made me
00:34:41 realize oh like all you have to do is just get used to it whatever part of it that that strikes
00:34:48 you is weird or you're not sure about just exposure expose yourself to it and eventually
00:34:52 you'll like it so i went through that process with anime and then i went well surely this applies
00:34:57 to everything else so i taught myself to like spicy food i couldn't even handle texas peat
00:35:03 i couldn't even handle like fucking fire sauce at at taco bell and i trained myself up to be able
00:35:08 to handle like really spicy thai food and it's just like i now i'm sure how high your spice
00:35:15 tolerance is i remember me you and ben at a vietnamese place i believe i was it was like a yeah i
00:35:21 think it was that and there's they have some sort of pepper or thing with jig in the middle of the
00:35:25 bowls and you pointed that it's a thai place oh it's a thai place okay you pointed that shit and said
00:35:31 okay so that thing right there that thing is hot af yeah but be careful guys all right and so ben
00:35:38 ate it and was like i'm gonna have to a little bit hot and i ate it i was like wait this is like
00:35:43 dangerous and we just sort of looked at you and you just sort of i think it was just that it was
00:35:48 the wrong one oh oh i'm weak no it i think it was that i had misjudged what pepper it was
00:35:57 because like i know for a fact ben spice tolerance is no better than mine so uh but like i mean at
00:36:03 the time that you guys were living with me my tolerance had already gone down because i was not
00:36:07 training myself anymore like well i literally spent a year like non-stop eating nothing but
00:36:12 spicy food until i had a high tolerance and then it completely went to shit when i stopped eating
00:36:17 spicy that makes sense as an explanation but that i it's still been in my um rotation of funny
00:36:23 things to make fun of my friends i told people all the time you're gonna have to like fill me with
00:36:27 evidence in triplicate signed for me to like take that out of my rotation sorry when i was in Rome
00:36:33 the worst i don't want to take that out of your rotation because that is so innocent the absolute
00:36:37 worst thing that i saw people do like the different tourists that would walk past all the anglo pieces
00:36:42 of shit i would walk past some tourist trap and i would see people in Rome in the capital of Italy
00:36:51 i see it's been saying for that like like like hundreds of thousands of years they walk they go
00:36:59 here and they order spaghetti at meatballs at some fucking irish persians tourist trap italian
00:37:06 restaurant they don't go out and actually try italian food why would you come here if you just
00:37:12 want to order the same things that you can order at home what is the point you spent hundreds of
00:37:18 dollars to get here why are you like this why i hear reviewer people talk about how oh you know
00:37:24 you need to have better taste games or movies or whatever what comes to my mind is the dentist
00:37:30 fallacy which is that dentists feel matter at all that they think that they have the right to talk
00:37:36 to you like children because you aren't taking care of your teeth and the thing is that oh hey you
00:37:42 know trained medical professional who's got your life vaguely together is able to like go to sleep
00:37:47 and wake up at the same time therefore have a time to brush your teeth right you know some people
00:37:52 have depression or anxiety or they just fall asleep randomly you know it's fucking hard it's not
00:37:59 it's good to brush your teeth yeah i brush my teeth every night did you guys know that it was harder
00:38:06 did you guys know that dentists have like an extremely high suicide rate ha ha ha yeah it's
00:38:12 because their practitioners fucking based on lies no it's because they always have lost to hang
00:38:17 let me tell you right now guys i i i talked about this on a recent um pub crawl but i want to hear
00:38:23 your thoughts you don't have to brush your teeth all you have to do all you have to do to make your
00:38:31 teeth okay is to not consume sugar sure if you consume i know people who brush their teeth every
00:38:42 day twice a day still get cavities because they drink soda but i know people who don't brush well
00:38:50 this happened to me for a while when i quit soda for there was like a good year span where my teeth
00:38:55 were perfectly fine in spite of not brushing just as i have always not done and um your no cavity of
00:39:01 like acceptable teeth though is like way off like a rows of normal for this movement like
00:39:07 acceptable teeth is teeth that don't get cavities i mean okay as british standards by the way
00:39:14 that's the thing like most like the main reason to brush your teeth is if you want them to be white
00:39:19 and like i do which most like it's very highly valued here in america just because it's a big
00:39:25 fucking cultural meme yeah that's true and uh here we are in america conditioning stop being gay
00:39:33 i'm just uh i'm not proud of my poor hygiene i have poor hygiene but i'm not proud of it i'm not
00:39:39 gonna start it's not poor hygiene to have non-white teeth like teeth are not natural brush your
00:39:46 teeth at all or clean a part of your body because it's i'm telling you like okay i'm not i'm not
00:39:54 saying my teeth are in a good state i'm not like proud of the of my teeth because of the fact that
00:39:58 i do drink lots of soda and and uh fucking sugar and so my teeth do have problems but like i'm just
00:40:05 saying that that brushing your teeth is not the solution to avoiding cavities because you will
00:40:11 get cavities anyways if you consume and most of the people i know consult a medical practitioner
00:40:16 before listening to digi bro there's no dentist that will tell you that you just have to brush your
00:40:23 teeth and no one no no dentist will not say you have to not drink soda they'll all say that yeah
00:40:28 but they're like okay the thing about dentistry is that it is mostly a cosmetic business like it's
00:40:34 not really a health care service they dress it up with that so that people will feel that they have
00:40:40 to go but like dentistry is primarily cosmetic it's mostly about having straight and white
00:40:45 teeth and that's why everything in the fucking place is about how straight and white your teeth
00:40:50 can be straight and white it sounds like pastry oh yeah exactly we gotta get that
00:40:54 exactly listen i hate dentists as much as the next person but i i don't i'm the clean your teeth
00:41:02 and not drinking soda thing it's not convincing me i don't even dislike i don't even dislike going
00:41:06 to the dentist by the way i'm like a freak who doesn't even hate going to the dentist because
00:41:10 i've been so many times that i'm okay with sure yeah uh i think that's proof of what you're saying
00:41:15 earlier the more you repeat something that i mean i'm happy i'm happy to be agnostic about
00:41:21 whether or not it's actually necessary to brush your teeth or like if you can just like that's all
00:41:25 fine but i and i'm also sympathetic to this thing that like yeah it is one like i've been to japan
00:41:31 i've seen the people there with their fucked up teeth uh and that's just normal and most of them
00:41:35 don't like in a lot of those places where people have they have teeth that look fucked up because
00:41:40 they're crooked and they're not white but they're not unhealthy because those people don't drink the
00:41:46 amount of soda that we do in america they are not like they're not putting tons of fucking sugar in
00:41:51 their mouth and like the sugar is what rots your teeth like it might as well be one it's it's most
00:41:56 convenient to think of it as one to one hey man i'm sure you encourage people to consume less
00:42:00 sugar hundred percent one like i look at someone's one cavity like i look at devu who has a lot of
00:42:06 pride in never having had cavities and he brushes his teeth all the time but he also almost doesn't
00:42:11 consume sugar so like you know what the fucked up thing the most fucked up thing in my entire life
00:42:16 was was i okay i was so terrible about drinking soda like my entire life like from like age one
00:42:23 to like like recently i was just drinking like two cans a day it was awful it was horrible
00:42:29 two and i never had i never had a single cavity until i stopped drinking soda and then i got a
00:42:35 fucking cavity out of nowhere it's it's it's fucking not fair it was like a maybe it was like
00:42:40 that thing that mr burns has were like all the diseases were like trying to push through all
00:42:44 at once but then it's like if you take away a bunch of them then a couple can actually get through
00:42:49 yeah because i don't know so i brought up the dentist thing because i call it the dentist
00:42:54 fallacy because it's the thing that this person chose to specialize in and they have tunnel vision
00:43:00 regarding its importance and so imagine you know some people are like what you don't uh know
00:43:05 which is sub sub sub genre of metal is on the radio right now how are you living a functional
00:43:11 life if you don't know uh eight late 80s thrash hardcore from 90s thrash hardcore bitch the thing
00:43:20 about that though is that if you spend a couple of years listening to people like digis let's play
00:43:27 part of genre well whatever it doesn't matter you're the i know i know i know i don't have a
00:43:31 dysfunctional life i have to come up with a fake metal sub genre so so uh if you listen to people
00:43:41 who have who are always persnickety about having good opinions like digi who who insists you you
00:43:48 think your opinions out really long the more you listen to his shit the more you find out that he
00:43:52 does in fact apply this process to everything his chairs his walls his ceilings his floors his
00:44:00 houses his mouses his food his life his everything so it's not hypocrisy apply to all these things
00:44:09 the same logic of like experiment with absolutely everything and find the best one and and the
00:44:16 reason i feel that way is just that i see so many people that like they most people live sub optimally
00:44:25 and i don't just mean in terms of efficiency i mean in terms of like just their own mental well-being
00:44:32 like most people they just kind of get a job and then they have the job and it's like shouldn't
00:44:37 you be looking for the job that you can do best that will have the best min max of you know energy
00:44:45 put forth to rewards taken shouldn't you be looking like if you're gonna spend all your time watching
00:44:52 watching shit shouldn't you try to watch it that will give you something well if you're gonna play
00:44:58 a lot of video games shouldn't you go find the video games you'll really love and like i think most
00:45:02 people they'll consume and like with those those broad pop cultural things most of them again are
00:45:09 not bad most of them appeal to almost everybody in a very shallow way and so people will always say
00:45:15 like oh yeah i've played the new assassins creed i played the new call of duty i played the new
00:45:19 whatever but then like when you ask what's your favorite game it's never one of those it's always
00:45:26 something unique that they played usually as a kid because when you're a kid you don't know the
00:45:31 pop culture zeitgeist is easily you just go to the store and pick something that looks cool
00:45:35 and like maybe you you've did that a lot and you got a lot of bullshit that wasn't good so you stopped
00:45:41 that method but there was that one time you got that thing that was like life-changingly awesome
00:45:46 and it's been your favorite ever since and it's like you can have that again well you know what
00:45:51 it is um people treat life like they've just arrived in an unexplored land and they've they've
00:45:58 got to find where they're going to live and so like there are people live here like there are
00:46:03 signposts as to where to go in this new con that they've just arrived on and so they go through
00:46:07 and you know they'll find like you know the cities which are like the popular things like ah there's
00:46:11 a lot of good here uh maybe i'll keep going and and keep looking elsewhere but a lot of people
00:46:16 are just going to be like like this city's got everything i need man like why am i gonna keep
00:46:19 going and then of course some people are gonna like go out and they're kind of forge their own
00:46:23 path and discover new places and and find new trails and stuff and you know they'll find cool
00:46:29 stuff that other people didn't know and then some of those people will establish a new city and then
00:46:33 people will flock to that and some of those people will keep going others will stay there and be like
00:46:37 i'm content here because and like and maybe someone will make it they're on a new trail
00:46:41 they're like they find like a nice little valley or something they're like it's all metaphor
00:46:45 obviously and they're like you know what this is a nice place i'm just gonna camp it right here
00:46:49 even though over the next hill is like i don't know like a gold mine is like something that would
00:46:54 be incredible but like it requires energy and effort to continue to seek these things and so
00:47:00 after a while people are just like you know i'm content right here the majority of people are
00:47:03 just lazy just in everything you know well you could call it lazy but like it's fine for people
00:47:08 to just be content uh it's what i was saying when i was talking about the i g and seven of life
00:47:17 um you guys i'm sure know the allegory of the cave like and i think that's what we're kind of
00:47:22 describing here is like i guess you're right i guess you're right yeah like you don't know what's
00:47:27 above what's on the surface till you get i mean the first episode of growing the gond is literally
00:47:31 the allegory of the cave made into a show so let's make it let's make it relevant to anime uh
00:47:36 yeah and growing the gond it's like nobody believes coming out the surface is real
00:47:40 and he's like look all of our fucking people just like die in landslides all the time like don't
00:47:45 you think it would be nice if we lived somewhere where that didn't happen like but most people are
00:47:50 just like well i mean yeah that's how life is that's just what life is and it's like every time there's
00:47:55 something if there's anything that bothers me in my life my first thought is always there must be a
00:48:00 better way like surely and uh and i'm not even amazing at it tom was uh was telling me that
00:48:07 this is why he knows so much about computers because like tom is great at this i run into
00:48:12 lots of issues with with my computer and like i i've taken to just anytime anything goes wrong i
00:48:18 just asked tom and he's always found a solution for it because the second something bothers him
00:48:23 he goes well i know that this this can't be the way you know like there has to be something we can
00:48:28 do to a lot of us yeah i that's i totally do that with tom too a lot of computer and like
00:48:34 software issues are like black boxes and because you don't know that there even is a fix uh like
00:48:39 i feel actually there i there's a there's a there's a voicemail today that describes like
00:48:44 kind of a solution to our like voicemail uh issues and like because i had no idea how to do it uh
00:48:50 none of this would have made sense i never would have thought to do things this way but uh and we'll
00:48:55 get to that um but yeah i mean tangentially related but i am really sick of safe movies and
00:49:04 not just because they they upset me in the moment and you know like like i'm upset i want a movie
00:49:09 with like a 10 to 20 chance that i'll just be eviscerated while watching the movie i'm sick of
00:49:14 these safe movies ironically i'm upset with them because the like safe movies have not been the
00:49:20 most popular movies of all time and they haven't been for like a long time
00:49:25 nay if you remember is that true though isn't marvel like by far the most popular right now
00:49:29 yeah i'm saying that's not always been the case oh it hasn't always been okay nay do you remember
00:49:34 in the final fantasy lecture how i was mildly unimpressed with your eye over final fantasy
00:49:38 because like what the last few games have been bad you know like whatever yes i don't care um and i
00:49:43 haven't uh i haven't forgiven you yet for feeling that way okay well well i forgive you because i
00:49:48 haven't spiritually felt that until i re-watch a lot of disney movies and i realized how good
00:49:56 renaissance disney is and it is unorally some of my favorite art of all time and i think about how
00:50:04 every single year from like 1989 to like 1990 or to however long the renaissance was
00:50:11 every single fucking year what he said 1989 to 1990 oh oh sorry sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry
00:50:21 well what's the one movie that was it like little mermaid and just little mermaid or something
00:50:25 yeah yeah uh but every single year they popped out like incredible movies with like unbelievable
00:50:30 projection values that are ironically like like la hunchback no chadam takes fucking risk sure it
00:50:35 has the shit gargles that everyone hates and is a huge fucking meme but it honestly takes
00:50:40 risk in a lot of different ways that's sanctuary scene we're causing more crimes no chadam and he
00:50:44 fucking screams sanctuary down the crowd and it's fucking beautiful by the way those are ground
00:50:49 baking pieces of media that came out every single year like the final original final fantasy games
00:50:53 and then it just like peered out for a while and like zootopia is good but like it's not trying to
00:50:59 be like the hunchback of no drum it's not trying to have these incredible set pieces or make any
00:51:03 broad like real statements it has all about that organizational momentum organizational momentum
00:51:10 and like belief in the project and just morale and the creative flow and when it's on it's fucking
00:51:17 on and then the white 2k disaster didn't fry computers but it fried many creative minds
00:51:22 so it would seem and by the way uh they didn't make one in 1993 but that's because they were
00:51:28 working on the lion king so that would make sense but talking about king is the best production
00:51:34 cycle of all time talking about the fucking gargoyles from from hunchback you know i thought you
00:51:40 were gonna complain about disney movies because i complained about them for things like the gargoyles
00:51:44 because that's a safety measure because literally they're like oh but this one has like you know
00:51:49 issues of image and looking ugly and also has like suggested rape and it criticizes christians
00:51:56 and it doesn't have like a whole lot of goofy scenes we need to inject some really uninspired
00:52:01 goofy characters so that people who don't like serious catholic shit will be able to at least
00:52:09 sit through the movie okay that okay that is the fucking word the gargoyles are the worst thing in
00:52:16 any disney movie ever because it's such a bizarre half measure that makes no sense if you think about
00:52:23 for more than two fucking seconds okay in a disney movie you would think if the writers have some
00:52:28 sort of dark tones they wanted to explore disney would say okay yeah don't explore those because
00:52:33 this is disney and we don't want to have that in a movie because you know our target audience is
00:52:37 children we don't want to have dark tones but they have dark tones and execute them beautifully i've
00:52:42 watched hunchback notion down extremely recently in the past month uh fucking literal nine i love
00:52:47 that movie uh and it executes its themes perfectly but then they're like well oh you know i'm getting
00:52:54 kind of scared like you know pull the call on my shirt sweat in a little bit this is a dark movie
00:52:59 time to add the gargoyles so you know like the kids will still be interested but here's the thing
00:53:04 there's still all of the dark shit there so if you're a baby and you're amused by jess now xana
00:53:09 saying pour the wine and cut the cheese then you're going to be scared by claud throw a little
00:53:15 fucking raping ismeralda on screen and burning her to death and likewise if you're an adult who
00:53:22 likes frollo trying to rape ismeralda you're gonna be like oh the fucking gargoyles oh my god
00:53:27 raises paw yeah yeah so no one's going to be happy no one's going to like like either of these
00:53:35 two things you're not appeasing the children you're making them sit through a boring movie they won't
00:53:39 like there's there comes a time i think with big productions where they where they say it's a sad
00:53:45 thing but companies have to do this a lot they say we know we're not going to please everyone
00:53:51 all the way so we're gonna try to please or you know like they said like okay throw out the united
00:53:56 collective possible 10 out of 10 vision for some people instead we will take like across the board
00:54:03 eights or like across the board nines that we can get which is sad it's a sad artistic compromise
00:54:08 but i guess that's just business the bizarre part is is that it comes so close the hunter
00:54:12 no shame comes so close to just being a great movie with no flaws and i just think if disney
00:54:19 just a fucking if michael eisner just allowed the things to continue the way that all the writers
00:54:25 and all the artists want to push it to and they allowed the creative produce to go to like like
00:54:30 up to 11 and they allowed to have all the crazy dark shit that they want to put in it and you know
00:54:35 this one movie in this fucking like 10 year run of great movies that all peer to children this
00:54:42 one movie oh i'm so sorry it's like an e10 plus rating oh you know heaven forbid that they would
00:54:49 have swept the fucking academy awards they would have won every single like academy that they could
00:54:54 it would be great and everyone would have looked back on extremely fond but the problem is now but
00:54:59 the gargles and all you know a couple other shit just makes it so that couldn't reach the heights
00:55:04 that it could have otherwise because they were so scared about not reaching their usual target
00:55:08 i just want to i want to corroborate all of munchie's opinions on hunchback
00:55:12 it's the only movie i actually like from that era though uh i think of almost every movie in that
00:55:19 is fucking key now i've i've been recently i've been i've been watching just movies a lot recently
00:55:25 i think they're all landmarks in cinema and animation they're beautiful to look at they all
00:55:30 have incredible colors and they all have incredible animation i just could talk about them forever i
00:55:35 love the meta story behind disney and era i love the story behind michael isner and how he came
00:55:39 to be all this sort of stuff everything about them is perfect and they bring such joy to my heart
00:55:43 they are the best movies of all time well it's the best common part of history of all time to swing
00:55:48 in with a big fat pseudo disagreement my problem with probably the entire company-wide creative
00:55:56 philosophy of the entire disney super conglomerate since the late 80s can be summed up in the
00:56:04 fact that they boast about how many times they rewrite and re-storyboard their shit during the
00:56:11 production process which they frame as a constant effort of evolution and bringing the story and
00:56:18 the film to a greater height of of optimal realization but when i walk away from their movies
00:56:24 i come away underwhelmed thinking i felt like i just watched a frankenstein together mishmash
00:56:29 pishposh of different ideas that kept getting edited and i felt like i was like this was not a
00:56:35 smooth ride because i kept bumping over a shitload of staples what i don't know what the gargoyles
00:56:39 are what movie are referring to specifically when you think all of them starting with the little
00:56:45 mermaid um most of them they're all like like hodgepodge frankenstein like has someone much
00:56:50 had to know it was obvious i feel like the gargoyle effect is similar to i mean i i've always hated
00:56:56 the hakuna matata sequence in like lion king i just thought it was really lame and boring and
00:57:01 like for babies wait but that progresses the plot and it's and it's a fun music no no i was
00:57:07 exaggeration i hate fun i was uh the progress is great the progress is great and it progresses the
00:57:13 plot and it's a montage so that i was exaggerating when i said all of the problem i specifically
00:57:19 mean dumb and boring frozen i don't see the appeal i prefer watching nala uh you know get
00:57:27 clearly wet during can you feel the love tonight that's that's the kino moment right there hey you
00:57:33 know all this talk of like i i think the lion king is a great movie and i think it's i think it's a
00:57:38 great movie and not boring yeah that's a that's a very that's pretty much the opinion of everyone
00:57:43 other than me munchie so munchie are you ready for the lion king to get totally ruined when they
00:57:47 redo it oh yeah oh okay the disney live action movies are so bad action or something yeah i think
00:57:54 it's a live action realistic cg oh are you what yeah i know it's gonna be fucking crazy dude okay okay
00:58:01 okay okay all right i read an article about the live action lad which is my favorite disney movie
00:58:07 except it's not because hulture james but you know i like a lad and always have a place in my heart
00:58:10 because i like this next game uh and shout out to robin williams get hang in yourself will give you
00:58:16 such a crick in the neck robin williams uh uh there was a live there's a live action
00:58:21 land coming out soon like in the next couple years and one of the articles was don't worry guys
00:58:26 we're going to make jasmine way more feminist like you know she was just she was just a you know
00:58:31 cool sexy lamp and i'm not no way no way i'm not against jasmine being feminist but here's the
00:58:36 thing she already fucking was and that was her entire character that she was a feminist so okay i'm
00:58:42 not upset that they're going to make her more feminist i'm upset that these people are framing
00:58:47 it like they've done justice to land like you know we've no we don't understand the story to make
00:58:52 jasmine more feminist but no it's already there monchi what they mean is they're going to put more
00:58:57 clothes on jasmine they're going to take this character who dresses light because she lives in
00:59:02 a desert and they're going to put her in more clothes okay so they're gonna watch so they're
00:59:07 gonna keep in the original lad you know she runs away from home she doesn't want to be treated like
00:59:11 a toy you know she she she doesn't want to be married someone who she doesn't love you know she
00:59:15 does all these proactive things in the plot oh that's not feminist slap a brick out of the oh
00:59:19 dude i'm gonna i'm gonna get up we've done now uh um because what would be more feminist than
00:59:26 being ashamed of the human body yeah pretty much i i mean i don't know i guess it's not about this
00:59:32 is why the the like birk or whatever is like a weird feminist thing because like okay true it does
00:59:38 cut off the that evil sinister male gaze but at the expense of like a woman being you know like
00:59:45 unable to kind of express us like is that worth it is this disclaimer monchi's opinions have stopped
00:59:50 when he stopped talking uh understood understood look whatever i don't care about this i was just
00:59:55 gonna say about this topic of corporate meddling and like uh i don't know like like a creative spark
01:00:00 being kind of like uh interfered with by by business necessity like i get why it happens
01:00:06 and it reminds me of what happened to elon musk recently uh which was just he he stepped down
01:00:12 from uh the board of directors at tesla he's still ceo but he stepped down from the board of directors
01:00:17 did he step down or was he forced out because i know he's not the chair well i mean there was
01:00:21 pressure he he stepped down is what i read um i mean you know he i'm sure this was in reaction
01:00:26 to pressure so how much of this was like volunteer i mean i don't know exactly i'm sure it was just
01:00:30 to control it apparently worked out a deal of some kind where this was like the thing he probably
01:00:34 like did that got to stay being ceo doesn't matter but like the point is um the reason why he had to
01:00:39 do it was because after his appearance on the joe rogan podcast where he smoked the weed um like
01:00:45 there was a lot of people were criticizing him and shit and in response to that he made a tweet
01:00:50 he made a tweet it's all about this one tweet which was um thinking about taking it was something
01:00:56 like thinking about taking tesla public at four twenty dollars per share or whatever it was um and
01:01:03 and then the further line was funding secured and the issue is with that funding secured line
01:01:08 because it turns out that was like not really true and like okay this was clearly like a joke
01:01:15 but you have to like because he's such a huge guy and like the court like he is the ceo and it was
01:01:20 chairman of the board of this giant company that does these big important things like i guess he
01:01:27 does have these responsibilities to be like completely truthful and not mislead people at all
01:01:32 because i don't know maybe somebody when they heard that news like invested their life saving
01:01:36 because i don't know what's going to do this this time to make no this is this is this is people
01:01:40 who who had it out for elon and this was a convenient excuse oh just need a god damn satire tag
01:01:46 what is saying is that he did this this is why slash s at the end of that post this is why saved
01:01:52 everything corporations are the worst everyone just needs to work by themselves in isolation
01:01:56 have a patreon doesn't matter how big your dreams are no one has twitter twitter rooms
01:02:01 everyone's careers i love elon and yes twitter definitely did fuck him up real bad here i don't
01:02:06 actually think that like this is such a like elon is kind of a weird unstable guy like he whatever
01:02:14 he's got like a crazy sense humor it's fine i like him a lot i think he's like the best human on the
01:02:17 planet basically but still the fact remains that he is a weirdo uh who like is like when you're
01:02:25 the CEO of a company like you kind of are held to just a way higher standard because people are
01:02:30 depending on you and i really do believe in the philosophy of like with great power comes great
01:02:35 responsibility and it sucks and you're gonna get fucked over real easily yeah but it's with great
01:02:40 power comes great responsibility not with great power comes no sense of humor like like okay i hear
01:02:45 you i hear you but the thing is i don't know how much of that was actually a joke and i haven't
01:02:50 looked into it for 20 a share yeah yeah what there's no way that was gonna be you know what
01:02:56 would uh what that reminds me of talking about when you ascend to some higher plane of status
01:03:01 people put responsibility on you now um chairman of a company statements you make about the company
01:03:07 you're the chairman of that makes sense but what to me is weird is most subscribed youtubers
01:03:16 responsibility to not say the n word because it'll fuck up our ad revenue how dare you do that
01:03:24 you gotta take the black you fucked this up for us pewdiepie i'm sure that if i through the
01:03:31 lottery of the algorithms had become the most subscribed youtuber i would have changed my
01:03:37 philosophy my self-serving desire to get on youtube and would have elected myself the fucking pope
01:03:43 bishop of youtube and changed my whole priority to be about supporting the youtube community and
01:03:51 not about supporting my own channel like every other goddamn youtuber pewdiepie you're the most
01:03:55 subscribed so you need to like look out for us right for some fucking reason the most eyes and i mean
01:04:03 i don't really blame youtube for what they did i just hate that the people whipped up the kind of
01:04:07 like uh fear mongering and what's the word uh like reactions that aren't deserved you know something
01:04:13 like that whatever it was do all of you guys know about the most popular fortnite streamer maybe just
01:04:19 straight up most popular twitch streamer i don't know shit about this i don't know shit about
01:04:22 twitch but i hear about this yeah yeah yeah how he has a mic pens policy to not stream with women
01:04:29 yes yes because so to catch everyone up uh if it be some people don't know because he is married
01:04:36 and if he streams with women people are going to go oh are they having an affair oh look at this
01:04:42 thought over here right i believe we briefly discussed this on a previous episode but i'm
01:04:46 i'm happy to excuse me i don't listen to the show whoops i'm like one of those early uh biggest
01:04:51 problem guests who don't know shit but so i haven't heard this episode either so i'm so sure yeah dad did
01:04:58 you do you know about this whole controversy i've never even heard this guy before i do right so he
01:05:03 doesn't stream with women and people have compared it to how mic pens he has a policy of never being
01:05:07 alone with a woman and surprisingly there's never been that much of a blowback for that because
01:05:13 people understand because i mean it's happening right now it's like oh there's you know i was
01:05:17 raped by this guy 45 years ago right and while we were alone in the room at one point so you
01:05:22 don't know for sure right yeah i understand that and and he has the same this this twitch streamer
01:05:27 guy has the same policy of i don't want to bring this kind of hammer down on my head and i did
01:05:32 read one of those articles you know modern day sjw is now they they have to like write things
01:05:37 really carefully because they know what all the fucking you know shit lord rebuttals are gonna be
01:05:41 so they they did but before before you say that i just want to specify for the audience uh of like
01:05:47 a big part of why he wants to not be seen with women is that the people like of like the people
01:05:53 themselves his fans don't spread rumors about them having an affair it's mostly consumed about fans
01:06:00 and like the online perception his audience think like spreading right about him indeed exactly
01:06:05 yeah yeah recognizing what's happened it sounds like what somebody who's cheating on his wife would
01:06:09 say it seems pretty guilty to me we're spreading this rumor around what no i'm not cheating on you
01:06:15 with her if i was cheating on you with her i would pretend to be going out with someone else and then
01:06:20 i would go with her in secret tom just reminded me i was uh no please oh well i don't know that
01:06:27 wasn't he done he was he was gonna read something oh oh i thought i was i'll get back to it in a
01:06:32 second but all i did you say is fucking anyway uh tom reminded me of i was reading this article
01:06:37 about um privacy and how the concept of privacy only really began in like the late 1800s because
01:06:46 like up until that point most societies were like you know like it was a tight-knit small group who
01:06:53 all needed and relied on each other and there wasn't really that much room for people to even
01:06:57 be doing like vastly different things from one another and because these groups were smaller
01:07:02 there also was not even like there was there was like not a conceit of your privacy being at risk
01:07:10 like so whatever you did in the privacy of your home like there wasn't really a concept of like a
01:07:14 public figure because you know everyone's everyone's in a small fucking town you can't be there's
01:07:21 no famous people you know right i mean like london existed and like you know there had been
01:07:27 a lot of stuff before i think that's strange to me london is not the one in your thing you know
01:07:31 it's a big city it's on commerce but it's nowhere near like people if you're thinking of like old
01:07:36 if you're thinking of old london you're thinking of like 1800s industrial revolution where everyone's
01:07:40 poked like packed into small houses london and that's not how it was and write an article the
01:07:46 ninja guy whatever his name is i don't remember names whenever i read articles i just remember
01:07:50 like the ideas right and the article made me realize that like the person who wrote it doesn't
01:07:55 really understand what it's like to be popular l right doesn't understand what it's like to have
01:07:59 people know you to be sort of a public figure because the way the article was written again it
01:08:04 was one of those ones that was really mincing words you could tell it wasn't to go full you know
01:08:08 social justice about it but she knew that you know that would look wrong so she really meant
01:08:13 her words basically saying imagine that being expected to not lie what a shock she was saying
01:08:18 basically saying you know the stream his his policy of not streaming with women is misguided
01:08:26 it's okay horribly misguided in fact but what does it say about twitch culture that even
01:08:34 the most famous twitch streamer is afraid of their backlash and their toxicity and i thought about
01:08:43 that joking my chin thinking you know this person she's she writes for a somewhat known
01:08:48 like online magazine the one who is the most afraid of the backlash like you would like
01:08:54 here's the thing right despite that this woman is obviously a writer or at least a part timer for
01:08:58 some website i think i heard of before she probably doesn't have like anyone who like
01:09:06 thinks about her work and judges it as like a person if you know what i mean and that despite
01:09:13 being like a like a like d-list internet personality myself i've experienced this
01:09:20 for the experienced when you've made enough of an impact or made enough of an impression good or bad
01:09:26 and you experience absolute strangers picking around at your shit and talking about you like
01:09:33 they know you when they when you feel like they don't and it feels like they're talking about you
01:09:38 without your permission and it feels fucking weird and i think unless you felt that you don't
01:09:45 understand how vulnerable being popular is it doesn't do anything to boost your confidence
01:09:52 necessarily it doesn't make you immune to feeling weirdly violated it doesn't make you immune to
01:09:58 rumors often people who can stand being a top-level celebrity are just the ones who were
01:10:04 bred through the system of just the ones who were able to deal with it in the first place it's not
01:10:09 like becoming a millionaire makes you able to deal with it it's just that the only people who can
01:10:13 deal with it are the only people who stick around in the first place and these rumors can be spread
01:10:18 around so easily and with so much hatred right they can be post on encyclopedia and all that
01:10:25 should just pass it all over there and do you want that to even like have the chance of impacting
01:10:30 your marriage and then and then these people like have this foregone conclusion this isn't even
01:10:35 something that's like discussed or analyzed it's just assumed that these people are popular and
01:10:40 they have to set a fucking good example for everyone else so top fortnite streamer you need
01:10:47 to risk the hurt of your family and your lifestyle and your job and your career because we need fair
01:10:55 representation on fortnite right like on fucking twitch right because you don't want to have you
01:11:02 know a woman get called thought all all up and down the corner and like all this sexist abuse
01:11:08 right you know that's going to happen that's part of why you don't want to do it but it's your
01:11:13 responsibility to like try and fight against it and to take the hate upon yourself because you're
01:11:20 the most popular i want to follow up on that but first i never actually got to the point of what
01:11:24 i was saying earlier uh that that privacy was this new concept from the late 1800s and that like as it
01:11:31 spread um like that as soon as like tabloids were a thing it was immediately like anybody in any
01:11:39 position of like being known at all was gonna have things said about them and anytime that somebody
01:11:47 was upset that things were being said about them the immediate backlash was well you wouldn't have
01:11:53 anything to hide if you weren't doing anything wrong that's the that's the one that's the one
01:11:57 that always gets to me and that's it's so fucked because it's like first of all like i the reason
01:12:06 i have to hide is because i'm doing something that you will consider wrong that's why i have to hide
01:12:14 because this world is a bunch of people who think that their way of life is the correct one
01:12:20 and therefore anything that goes against the grain of what they think is right
01:12:24 they're going to be upset with and i don't want to be in a position where i have to constantly
01:12:31 explain and justify every fucking thing that i do and it's funny because i have been in that position
01:12:38 for the most of the last like you know since becoming famous and a lot of it is because
01:12:43 i'm somebody who's obsessed with being understood so like every time i do something and people
01:12:49 don't understand it i go out of my way to explain it but eventually that just got so exhausting
01:12:54 because you're never gonna you know if you have a constantly evolving audience and they're not
01:12:59 going to consume absolutely every piece of media you you do especially not if you're just like
01:13:03 doing a corrections or like a further clarifications video people don't care they don't care that
01:13:09 much nobody cares enough to get intimately into your life so it's like your options are basically
01:13:15 either do things in public that others may find questionable and then spend every fucking waking
01:13:22 hour explaining yourself or just say fuck off give me my privacy you know so i can just live
01:13:29 my life without having to explain it to you because and i don't know why people don't
01:13:35 complete like i on some level i do but i don't understand why people don't just take the mindset
01:13:39 of like other people's lives are different from mine i should just accept that i won't understand
01:13:46 everything about what they do you know like it's just that people think that they're right as i think
01:13:51 really what it comes down to and and they further around they don't have a frame of reference or
01:13:54 even understand the different experience of other people which is why i think it's so easy for like
01:14:00 lots of poor people to have very little empathy for rich people even though rich people for example
01:14:05 just have they have very different problems than like poor people but they're still real problems i
01:14:10 would say uh i would understand why i think i think typically very very general here a lot of people
01:14:18 with financial struggles overestimate how much their problems are all because of their financial
01:14:25 struggles yeah they put way too much the blame on that and then conversely it's an easy scapegoat
01:14:29 and then conversely a lot of people who are well off and don't have financial struggles
01:14:33 underestimate how fucking swell it is and how much easier it makes their lives to not have those
01:14:38 financial problems if it's been a while since they've had any i completely agree if you do
01:14:42 i think that all those what what the big misunderstanding is is that the reason people
01:14:47 um like the real appeal of having money is simply freedom it's not that because because money does
01:14:55 not bring happiness as the the aidage goes and it's been scientifically proven this is a fact
01:15:01 money does not bring happiness but say the peak is seventy thousand dollars a year i believe like
01:15:06 what i think the the rich don't understand about the poor is that for a lot of them there is just
01:15:12 no way out like there's nothing they can do within their environment to change things and if there
01:15:18 were they probably don't know what it is and they have no concept of it like there's no way for them
01:15:24 to grasp it and rich people are just like well i've also got my you know i've got issues too but at
01:15:31 least you have the power to redirect your life at least if you think like oh my job is a huge problem
01:15:38 you can try to go get another job and granted it's still a huge risk it's still yeah it's not
01:15:43 like anybody has the power to just completely uproot all the time um and like i've worked to put myself
01:15:49 in a position like that like the reason that i like doing internet work and working from a
01:15:54 decentralized location based on fan donations is that i don't have to answer to anybody so every
01:16:00 time something's even slightly off about my life i can work on changing it and try to try to make
01:16:06 everything just right but like that would not be possible if not for at the very least my baseline
01:16:12 understanding that that is even conceivable like most people don't even conceive of that as something
01:16:17 that they could live is really the the the thing that makes it so appealing it makes it so powerful
01:16:23 because like when i had to go back to a job after making a ton of money online like everything changed
01:16:28 it's like oh well like i have to be here at a certain amount a certain amount of time so like i
01:16:33 stopped going to conventions i stopped seeing friends as often like all these things i just like
01:16:37 could do you just can't anymore and like it's obvious but it is a huge detriment and changes
01:16:42 the entire way you think the entire way you have to function because like a third of your life is
01:16:46 now taken this this is related to something that i want to talk about later uh while thinking rather
01:16:52 reflecting ruminating upon the capital g capital b great people in life i was i was i was interested
01:16:59 in how all of them are nobles all of them are people who come from the upper crust of
01:17:05 sight i'm talking like pre let's say like pre 19 or i'm sorry 1850 almost everyone that you're going
01:17:13 to have a strong emotional connection to and and have like a narrative and you know piece of history
01:17:18 dedicated to them all that not just like to say kings or any just you know the the popular political
01:17:24 and religious and you know figures of the day the capital g capital p great people are all going
01:17:30 to be nobles and it comes down to i think i think i've i've isolated one specific thing it's because
01:17:36 when you have that much power and influence and you know money you are able to get a good education
01:17:43 and i reflect after reflecting upon history i think education is probably the most important thing
01:17:49 that you can do to have a better life not to just say like you know the institutions of
01:17:54 uh depending on the type of education but yeah i mean it's just not even college is good specifically
01:18:00 i'm just saying that having the worldliness and having the ability to maybe go to a different
01:18:05 country and learn things about the people learn things like oh these people are different why
01:18:08 are they different learn about the you know underlying uh structure of society learn about
01:18:13 these things learn about math learn about science learn about you know history and stuff like that
01:18:16 it's so so vital to having a well-cultured well-mean and intelligent person to be able
01:18:22 to understand not just you know being able to recite math problems but being able to understand
01:18:28 the underlying course of history course of society and be able to like you know have your
01:18:33 influence directed onto that society it's so important that's the most important thing that's
01:18:37 why power and money is so much it's it's almost directly to education i have a like a like a
01:18:43 theory a life i have like a digi bro hypothesis level of like this is really grasping at
01:18:50 theoretical straws makes a whole lot of sense to me what i'm about to say is that it has that being
01:18:58 a noble is not a state of uh physical satiation of resources but a state of mind that people who
01:19:09 are living in some white trash by the way what what a digi bro hypothesis is is something that
01:19:14 you know for a fact is true you just have no idea what words you can say that will make other people
01:19:20 recognize yes so you could be living like a white trash like trailer park there's a fucking like
01:19:29 half broken toilet in the front yard kind of life right that level of resources and i think what really
01:19:36 gets you down if these people are so poor how come they have so many broken toilets yeah why do they
01:19:41 spend all their money on because they got a shit no matter if you're rich or poor you got a shit
01:19:45 if you're that poor you can't flush you can't afford it so you got to keep buying another toilet
01:19:52 every time you needed to shit no he's right no one who's actually no one who is actually poor
01:19:57 has a toilet like if you live my mind for that for you with the world's your toilet my my buddy
01:20:03 don son uh who's uh you know vietnamese um yeah lived in vietnam for a little while and they don't
01:20:10 do toilets over there what they do is that they'll have a little bridge over a ravine with a hole in
01:20:16 the middle of it no and just go up on this bridge and you squat over the hole and you sit down into
01:20:22 the ravine there's like a koi fish down there that eat all the shit up whoa and then uh and then you
01:20:26 wipe with leaves whoa okay all right right that's actually that's what the third world no pun intended
01:20:33 and that's what i mean when i say poor is a state of mind right uh and i'm not saying that the physical
01:20:38 realities of it aren't very limiting i get that right i don't want to be like oh don't act poor
01:20:43 no no no it's a state of mind and it's not one you necessarily that have that much control over
01:20:48 when you know you're in a disadvantaged part of the world in in a uh rung of the world of rung of
01:20:54 society that's less valued that has less freedom that is seen as lower you can't help but feel
01:21:00 more demoralized about it right but what we don't but like what can be done is at least a little bit
01:21:07 a little bit of progress on on the individual level every day is all the free time you still have
01:21:14 like even if you are packed at work you know you have you work really long hours and you work
01:21:20 full time you still have at least a couple of hours in the day to do whatever you want maybe in
01:21:26 the week yeah maybe in the week right but you can do something with that time and it doesn't
01:21:32 have to be wasted but what happens is that most people uh i remember there was a cracked article
01:21:38 it wasn't like a one of those five amazing facts it was one of those personal story kind of articles
01:21:42 and it was saying you know if you want to make it anywhere in life you have to start now because
01:21:46 the cycle i was in said the article for years he said the cycle i was in was i had
01:21:52 have to wake up i didn't want to go to work but i had to go to work so i went to work and all day
01:21:56 at work all i would think about is all the books i wanted to write how i want to be an author how i
01:22:00 want to be a writer and i would just think of it all day at work and then like get home i'd get home
01:22:05 from work and i'd be at home and i'd have like three hours to do whatever the fuck i wanted but i
01:22:12 was pissed off and tired and filed the rest of that under hashtag fuck this day and then went to
01:22:18 sleep to repeat the cycle all over it this is my life this is my life i think that's the most people
01:22:23 and i was in that i was in that mindset um for a while but like when i worked at target like
01:22:30 because it was it was a it was a physically strenuous job because i was on the the flow team
01:22:35 and i'm weak but uh like a lot of the days i'd come home and just be tired like so tired i just go
01:22:41 straight to bed but then like there were days where like i was physically tired and out of it
01:22:45 and just done but i was like i need to make two videos a week if i want this channel to succeed
01:22:50 you know so that's what i did it was like no matter what their hat like it didn't matter if
01:22:54 i was like falling asleep while editing there has to be two videos a week or this channel is not
01:23:00 gonna succeed but you have to look at it i think that the the thing that that was different about
01:23:05 my mindset and this is the hardest thing for me to teach other people is that it can happen fast
01:23:12 like if you do it you you just gotta think of it like i'm doing this so that it because like
01:23:18 let's say that you you barely chip away at the thing that you are working towards like over the
01:23:24 course of years like that's years of you just getting further and further beaten down but if
01:23:30 you are trying if you're like really cramming it into every single waking hour you have there's a
01:23:35 chance it'll happen really fast you know and like with my channel's growth it was like then again i
01:23:41 was putting out two videos a week every week no matter what it took to get them out and like it
01:23:45 only took a couple months for me to get successful because there was just so many chances there were
01:23:50 so many you know so many lightning rods being placed in the ground that eventually something
01:23:55 had to get hit by fucking lightning you know and even if they don't immediately take off in a huge
01:24:00 way i this i can definitely guarantee that it is easy to get some positive feedback loop going
01:24:07 quickly even if it's small success which like for me and ben for example it was like when gib put us
01:24:12 in his like pony review like compilation thing that was the first moment where like all right people
01:24:17 actually like this stuff and they care and this is dope and that was something but it was a big
01:24:23 forward to at work like you know there's someone looking forward to the stupid shitty art you're
01:24:27 going to make when you get home that can at least raise your spirits and i will say to anyone who's
01:24:31 trying to break this cycle especially people who are at the bottom of it but actually especially
01:24:35 especially the people who have been at it for a couple of years and are totally demoralized about
01:24:40 it my mistake and i i recognize this just the last couple of days is that i was focused entirely
01:24:47 on getting out of my regular job 100% as fast as possible and which is the which is two extremities
01:24:55 right you could plan any other getting out of your job partially or getting out of your job
01:24:59 completely i went for completely you can try getting out soon or later i went for soon which
01:25:05 actually just made things harder because i wasn't satisfied with any of the progress i was making
01:25:09 until i had everything i wanted but if you could figure out how to have a plan to like reduce your
01:25:15 hours yeah that is actually what will get you from point a to b in a more realistic manner and i
01:25:20 almost never planned for that i i was full time and then like the second that i like realized the
01:25:26 channel was going to be successful i i had them cut my hours to part time because it was i was
01:25:32 like it's too hard to continue doing this job when they're working me because during the holiday season
01:25:38 it was like it was brutal because we were going at 2 a.m and they would often have us working like
01:25:42 you know as much as humanly possible so like it was getting really hard to do the youtube videos
01:25:49 and i was just like this is this is on a roll like this has a chance and like if i my dad was
01:25:57 super pissed at me when i cut down to part time because he was like you're gonna lose all the
01:26:00 benefits like how could you and i'm like because i don't plan to be here long like the whole point
01:26:05 of this is to not be here as fast as possible so if cutting my hours means that the youtube channel
01:26:11 can grow faster then that means it's that much and obviously this isn't something everybody
01:26:15 can do unless there is revenue coming in but that's the other thing is that getting getting enough
01:26:21 revenue to to to leave your job is hard getting enough revenue to cut your hours is not as hard
01:26:28 because like say you make a hundred dollars a week on whatever you're doing then it's like well
01:26:33 shit now that's you know that's a pretty huge chunk of a of a minimum wage paycheck and i know a lot
01:26:39 of people aren't in such convenient positions like you know digi you did you were able to like
01:26:45 not have to pay that many expenses in my case it was like when people talk about privilege i always
01:26:51 want to say like i completely believe that uh that i am a privileged individual but the privileges i
01:26:58 had were that my family was very loving and nothing to do with how much money they had
01:27:05 or how much it was that my dad thought i could do this and therefore encouraged me to do it
01:27:11 and i think that's the most important thing that you can get is like a safe environment because
01:27:15 space is such a better place yeah and i know people who uh who don't who who have like a family like
01:27:23 a i have friends who who come from families that had a lot of money who tried to put them through
01:27:28 college who tried like who would have been on that track but because they ultimately decided to do
01:27:33 like internet art or something that's not a guarantee that family cut them off and those
01:27:39 people are struggling now because they don't have the opportunity to sit at home and work on their
01:27:44 art until they're able to leave they are now living in a shit apartment somewhere trying to you know
01:27:50 work shit jobs trying to struggle to get it done and they're not making enough off of the other
01:27:55 art in order to put it back in but also with those people there's always an element of like
01:27:59 davoo said like there's it's just hard to find the energy and it's hard to convince yourself but
01:28:05 like i would encourage anybody if you're in a position where you're like i i just don't have
01:28:10 the energy to do it you have to just tell yourself the energy it doesn't matter like it doesn't matter
01:28:18 if you're tired and it hurts you have to do it because it's not supposed to feel good until you've
01:28:23 earned it you know here's here and this is it most it's most applicable to our audience who are full
01:28:29 of people who you know i assume want to be some sort of like youtube content career you know only
01:28:33 kind of career but this applies to everything this applies to any sort of like you know arts and crafts
01:28:38 you might want to do outside or just any sort of general hobby you know go into the gym or anything
01:28:43 like that this applies to all of it all if you want to like leave your job and start your own small
01:28:46 business of anything yeah exactly exactly anything it requires effort i mean i i i
01:28:52 climbed a mountain one time i was physically very weak at the time i was not somebody who
01:28:58 you would think could hike a mountain and it hurt and it sucked but i wanted to climb the mountain
01:29:04 and at the end of the day a a phrase i'll give you is don't run from the pain run with the pain
01:29:10 just be in pain because if you let yourself suffer that little bit then that means it'll
01:29:16 pay off later you know because you won't have to suffer anymore once you're at the top of the
01:29:20 goddamn mountain then it's over and it's like you know you you can sit you can keep you can take
01:29:26 your time inching up the mountain and it's just like you're gonna be on this mountain for fucking ever
01:29:30 or you can just climb the goddamn thing through the pain grit your teeth you reach the top and
01:29:35 you're like now i don't have to climb a fucking mountain anymore now there was a good thing where
01:29:38 someone's like pain points true north this this whole like you know speed this whole like fucking
01:29:45 thing we're this whole vibe we're writing right now any point in the last five years up until a
01:29:50 couple months ago my reaction would have been yeah right now though my reaction is yeah but okay hold
01:29:59 the fuck on though because i have been starting to more value a life of quality work rather than
01:30:08 like manic exhausting quantity work and i think that if you temper your mind correctly you can get
01:30:15 more done with less energy you know hashtag works mark not heart right and i even think well i didn't
01:30:21 have the freedom to do that before when i had my regular job cleaning windows that was uh you know i
01:30:25 had to i had to go double time in order to make progress right is that is anyone still here everyone's
01:30:32 be dead silent yeah okay okay cool i guess i have everyone's attention who so i i'm thinking back
01:30:38 because at the time i think more so than like my hours were booked my hours were taken up what was
01:30:46 even more so is that my ability to sit reflect and plan was was dwindled it wasn't it was it was uh it
01:30:55 was crippled and i think back now with with the greater clarity of thought i have now and i think
01:31:00 you know what i could have done i could have uh worked a little bit longer for a bit saved up some
01:31:06 money and got my own work vehicle and if i have my own work vehicle then i could actually then get
01:31:13 involved with the actual scheduling of the business because you know family business and i could have
01:31:17 actually scheduled my own work and said oh dad i'll take that job and that job and that job and i
01:31:24 could have taken control of my own job and actually started setting my own hours on my own as it was
01:31:31 because working in a family business while you don't have to deal with like the pressures of
01:31:36 like a boss who doesn't love you as a human being you do have to deal with the fact that you're kind
01:31:41 of being owned like you're just sort of like you're kind of stuck you can't you don't really have like
01:31:46 employee rights you can't say something like hey reduce my hours boss it's more like hey could you
01:31:52 reduce my hours dad and he'll be like uh yeah when they get around to it right i mean to strain
01:31:57 to strain my metaphor as far as i possibly can because that's what i love to do like i think that
01:32:03 when when you go to climb a mountain you often you you're saddled with this big backpack and you're
01:32:08 like you got to climb the mountain with this big backpack it's got all your necessary provisions
01:32:12 in it and you're just like okay and you start climbing and it fucking sucks and at some point
01:32:16 if you're really smart what you should do is sit down open the backpack go through it and make sure
01:32:21 it's all shit you actually need to be in there because the climb doesn't have to be as hard as
01:32:25 you think it does it just comes if you're carrying a bunch of it's always more important to work
01:32:29 smart than work hard so make sure you're going in the right direction as efficiently as possible
01:32:34 first before you get manic and work really really hard and do all that that's the mistake i've made
01:32:39 time and time again is that i yeah i know a lot of like what is the smart way to work but there's
01:32:45 there's often another smart way like the way i always looked at it was like okay on youtube you
01:32:50 have to game the algorithm and do content that everybody likes and all that stuff and and like
01:32:56 i don't want to do that so i'm just gonna work super hard and bust out as many videos as possible
01:33:01 and constantly be flooding things and then like over time i've come to realize that there are other
01:33:06 ways to work smart it doesn't have to be like this this is not a dichotomy that has to exist
01:33:12 like um and i one of my catchphrases that i'm trying to get off the ground is uh if you haven't
01:33:18 found a paradigm that works you're not done looking because there is there always is a paradigm
01:33:25 that works but like if you stop the book anywhere you're never gonna find it you just got to always
01:33:30 be questioning what you're doing and if it could be better so so i'm gonna like quickly go through
01:33:35 the specific scenario that happened with me just to a model so you can model yourself right so i
01:33:41 started trying to do youtube in may of 2014 by the way before he does that just consider if you want
01:33:46 end up where divu is right now consider whether or not you're going to do this all right no no no
01:33:51 i'm talking about how i could have done better and been in a better situation by now okay that's
01:33:56 what i'm saying learn from my mistakes my shortcomings is actually what i'm saying so i started
01:34:00 trying to do youtube in may of 2014 and it was around july of 2015 that i finally had a hour
01:34:07 reduction arrangement with my dad which was instead of working full time you work two days a week
01:34:13 and you don't uh all the money that you make just go straight to expenses and 200 dollars of your
01:34:19 youtube money you just pay that to me in exchange for only having to work two days a week which is
01:34:25 you know even less than part-time i think so that was the arrangement i got and once i got to that
01:34:30 nirvana wait wait wait sorry sorry i'm confused all your earnings go from your job go to expenses
01:34:38 hold on i was getting money i was being paid money i could do whatever with right right okay the
01:34:43 idea was hey dad i want to have fewer hours and he's like okay so you know your expenses stay the
01:34:48 same but you're just sure you don't get your own spending money right the money just goes straight
01:34:53 to expenses but then you're making a few hundred bucks a month from youtube right so you give me
01:34:58 200 to cover the rest of the expenses in exchange you only have to do two up two days a week of work
01:35:04 i feel like you're are you paying more to work less this seems i don't understand right but basically
01:35:09 what i'm buying is time instead of having to work five why do you have to buy time from your dad this
01:35:13 seems very odd yeah you know maybe what that's the situation i was in right of like you know i'm an
01:35:19 adult i should be paying my own expenses right you might i mean i think i've been having conversations
01:35:24 with with col lately she's like you know i think the way your dad treated you was actually very
01:35:27 manipulative and uh almost abusive and i'm like uh you know well probably but whatever it was the
01:35:35 situation i was in lots people are in manipulated abused situations and you have to figure it out
01:35:40 right so i basically just spent a year my whole strategy was make videos that get popular enough
01:35:45 so that i can buy my way out of this job but what i could have done is made videos
01:35:53 that's always on the table well then it would have fucked over my family because they needed the
01:35:56 money that i was well that's their problem not yours and you wouldn't be able to eat yeah i mean
01:36:00 it's my problem it's me paying for my own expenses and i was already an adult i was 20 years old so
01:36:05 i don't know whatever this episode is just very strange to me and i don't understand i understand
01:36:09 no no no i understand but like so what i could have done is is worked on videos a bit here and
01:36:16 there but focused actually on working more cleaning more windows for a bit saved up some money got a
01:36:22 work vehicle by probably the end of summer a really good vehicle and use that to schedule my own
01:36:27 hours and then just through my own agency been able to reduce my hours on my own time right
01:36:33 and that would have made things so much more relaxed you know i would have been able to focus
01:36:39 and think because when i finally had the chance to focus and think a year after starting youtube
01:36:43 that's when i was able to start getting successful so it's like you know maybe don't think of of
01:36:48 like this job as something you have to just kill right away as fast as possible like think of
01:36:52 it as a beast that you can tame and live with for a while i mean this is what i have done i have you
01:36:58 know so yeah you're right and and for a long time i thought oh man nat you're not going full in on it
01:37:03 but i'm like you know what your videos are good what can i say you can't argue with results you
01:37:08 can't fucking argue with the results uh so as much as we say oh yeah you got it you know no pain no gain
01:37:13 at the same time you know at the same time pain like physical stress sleep loss eating sugary foods
01:37:20 that is taking years off the end of your life that you could also no pain no gain but also don't
01:37:25 go out of your way to get punched in the face right yeah so lately i've been like it's you know what
01:37:31 i remember there was one like workaholic guy who like created an incredible business and burned
01:37:35 himself out completely at 35 by then he had looked at the metabolism of an 80 something he was forced
01:37:41 to quit and he said you know what for workaholics like me burning the candle in both ends is actually
01:37:46 the easy option a work life balance is actually the true skill that's the truly difficult thing
01:37:52 that the true master dude that is some shit that i'm in the middle of middle of trying to figure
01:37:57 out because like i for me working was just like it was just a way to kill time a lot of the time
01:38:05 like it's it's that i was so lonely and bored for most of my life that like working is the just
01:38:13 like what i defaulted to and this is why like in 2016 i was making like this insane number of
01:38:19 after dark vlogs and like um it's funny because there's a lot of fans who miss that era that they
01:38:25 call like the losing your mind in your room era because they related to it but it's like you did
01:38:29 that for too long there'd be no mind left to lose exactly i was legitimately losing my mind
01:38:35 in this room because it was i had gotten to a point in my career where i was making enough money
01:38:40 to be completely set and satisfied and i didn't know what to spend the money on like if you hear
01:38:47 the song rotten i say i got six thousand bucks and don't know what i want to own and it was like
01:38:52 because i had saved up that much which was a lot for me at the time like i'd never had that much
01:38:56 money and it was like i had already bought all the equipment for my job i was living in a good
01:39:02 situation and like i you know i would have liked to eventually move out of my parents house but i
01:39:07 didn't really have a reason to do so because everything was fine so it was just like well
01:39:13 what do i fucking do like what do i do with all the time i have in life so i just started making
01:39:20 videos constantly because i had no better idea of how to spend my time other than just make
01:39:25 shit and make shit and like it was it was so strange because it was like i didn't really
01:39:30 have a plan it was just do this as much as possible because again working hard like
01:39:36 divu said is kind of the easy way it's easy to tell yourself well if i just work all the time
01:39:41 is there's an obvious benefit i'm gonna make money but like most of those videos were not
01:39:45 making me any money most of them were not creatively satisfying most of it like you know the the best
01:39:51 thing that came of it is that people got so much of my voice that they in they just anybody who
01:39:56 was watching all of it because they had that little free time is going to love me but that has
01:40:02 huge diminishing returns because as soon as though that audience finds something to do with
01:40:06 their lives they're not following me anymore exactly me included it's true just just straight
01:40:12 up flooding the world the world with as much of your voice as possible like it's it's not always
01:40:16 going to work unless you have like a huge number of people but even then they're going to cycle out
01:40:20 constantly and and it's unreliable and so like at the time i was really relying on like my hardcore
01:40:25 fans it's like this is my central money makers but like as those people started getting jobs
01:40:32 or leaving the house or some of them just weren't interested in what i had to say now because
01:40:37 eventually i ran out of like super unique things to say because i'm one guy how many ideas can i
01:40:42 fucking have you know um so like well eventually i started losing some of those people and and
01:40:49 what i mean by not having a ton of unique ideas like i think that i was giving people
01:40:55 like the the least creative version and there's some people who like when you just you just speak
01:41:02 to them because it feels like you're having a conversation it feels like friendly but like
01:41:06 those videos are never going to get the attention that a hui's law video would you know present
01:41:11 the same that video i just put out what is deep um it like i literally made this exact same video
01:41:19 as a vlog two years ago during that stint and it was because at the time i didn't know how to write
01:41:25 it as a as a video because i hadn't spent that time like thinking it through really considering
01:41:30 it it was like here's an idea let me turn on a camera and rant it as fast as possible and just
01:41:36 publish it and like maybe it's got like 10 000 views and like for those 10 000 people they're
01:41:42 like oh this video you just made on your main channel it's just the same thing i watched two
01:41:46 years ago but the one on the main channel has 70 000 views because it was written and edited
01:41:52 and has a catchy thumbnail and title and it was prepared for an audience because i used in it i
01:41:58 just was using it as an advertisement for the iam games channel but like difference right right
01:42:02 used to be like the whole vlog group made sense in 2016 when a lot of people said they liked the
01:42:08 vlogs more i think i did too because the vlogs included a lot more side notes things that weren't
01:42:13 really essential to the point but just made the point more humanly digestible and it was much
01:42:19 more naturalistic whereas your videos were still really stiff and that has pretty well evened out
01:42:24 now you're writing in your vo it's all very naturalistic now it's your videos basically are
01:42:30 finally as good as i've always wanted them to be since i first found out about you in 2013 doing
01:42:34 pony shit like why thank you like yeah like this this year your your videos finally got that sweet
01:42:40 spot of just casuality i've always wanted it's really funny just agree you've never been as good
01:42:45 as uh sword art sucks etc go back to that please do more of those what would you like the sword art
01:42:50 one more of the astrosquare oh astrosquare that's true that's the best one um well you just like it
01:42:56 because it's long uh i like it because there's lots of parts and there's a great narrative going
01:43:01 between it's like compelling it's really long but long is good i mean if you went back and watched
01:43:05 those videos you'd realize that like half of it could be cut easily okay but but the fact of the
01:43:10 matter is i remember it more fondly than any other content and i think that's a powerful thing
01:43:15 i think if i'm objective okay i'm gonna also armchair psychology you and like tell you what
01:43:20 you're really thinking as if i fucking know but it's my pet theory with a lot of people
01:43:24 what did you when people tell you to go back to the astrosquare i think what they're telling you is
01:43:28 go back to finishing plans to fruition like here's the plan okay the plan finish the plan
01:43:35 you know because like the only reason standalone videos that i think are quite good i just like
01:43:39 the astrosquare stuff the best the only reason the astrosquare sucks was a plan that got followed
01:43:44 through is that i wrote the whole thing before it was out you know well most of it but in any case
01:43:49 like the people like astrosquare because it's it's super long and they want me to write stuff that's
01:43:56 super long and that kind of that that's sort of flowing engagement where you're like apart it's
01:44:00 like a show it feels like a whole show because it's as long as a whole show um and and i know that like
01:44:07 if you want to make something short you have to make it very robust and tight and great for people
01:44:12 to really remember it if you make something longer you can be a little bit more lax and you can you
01:44:17 could be more free flowing and people will still appreciate it because they're involved with it
01:44:21 for so long and i also want to talk about that that thing with that i was saying earlier about how
01:44:26 everybody remembers the best parts and everybody forgets the the worst elements exactly this applies
01:44:31 heavily to my fans talking about my content because almost all of them have some period that
01:44:37 they remember as the best period those also do have the most views which is a pretty good metric
01:44:41 of success i mean it really depends like i get my views have always been kind of all over the place
01:44:47 it just depends on what what videos can you just recognize that one just was the best which it was
01:44:53 which which one what are you talking astrosquare like the whole series doesn't have the most views
01:44:57 it's got like millions of views every part or no one million views i think no it's getting the first
01:45:02 couple parts in the last part are like getting there they'll be there in like a year but they're
01:45:06 okay maybe i'm wrong yeah i mean the fucking how to recognize a terrible anime has over three
01:45:11 million views by far my most successful video dear crunchy roll stop has more than any particular
01:45:16 part of the astrosquare and that came out last month okay um anyway drama so like my point is
01:45:23 that people look back and they they see they they remember like all the best things about those
01:45:29 i cannot watch a lot of my own shit like even the astrosquare sucks there's parts of it i just skip
01:45:35 because they're not good like my writing has gotten so much better my vio my uh you know if
01:45:41 i edit it myself my editing most of my old videos are like weird because they were trying to like
01:45:46 get past youtube copyright shit and it's just like you know of course people are going to remember
01:45:51 the emotional resonance they had with the videos and not like the actual quality of them which you
01:45:56 can only really experience in the moment you know but i mean okay like let's say that's all true
01:46:00 that's fine but why not apply that to like a new project all your better skills and all
01:46:05 oh i would love to mate you give me a fucking idea for one well okay uh i mean if the issue
01:46:11 was just you don't have an idea for one i mean i'm not trying to tell you what to do i'm just
01:46:15 you know laying out a case here i think you know it's not like i it's not like i haven't done it
01:46:19 because i don't think it's a good idea of course i would love to do another astrosquare sucks i
01:46:24 don't have anything i could talk about for 13 videos okay fair enough fair enough this isn't
01:46:28 even really a criticism i was just pointing out yeah an observation uh but by the way though i will
01:46:32 say because uh a certain a certain show is coming back for an entire year sort out online season three
01:46:40 50 weeks in a row get ready that's gonna be uh that's gonna be something all right it's gonna be
01:46:45 something all right i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do a video for every episode if that wasn't clear
01:46:49 do it dude do it yeah see but then that brings up like i think your greatest enemy so far has been
01:46:55 your like very unreliable attention span for projects you know that like hey man i did i did
01:47:02 my little pony every single time an episode came out uh yeah i mean did you just done a couple of
01:47:07 those like complete you know who cares if it was years ago what difference does that make i was the
01:47:12 same person you aren't doing it anymore i don't know man i feel like i feel like once you didn't
01:47:18 have to be as desperate for the money you've had a harder time like keeping up on things no i mean
01:47:23 there was the me and digi show that we would go back to my anime blogger days and you will find
01:47:28 that every single season i attempted to cover a show weekly and every single season i failed
01:47:33 until uh until my little pony and you know why because it comes out at the same time every week
01:47:40 and i just thought said i have to get a video out within four hours of it coming out for me the
01:47:45 key word is uh you have to get the video out because like you were desperate for the money and i
01:47:50 just feel like once uh after work came out i'm desperate for the money again i am i am beyond
01:47:55 bankrupt so uh like i have no money right that's why i phrase that your greatest enemy has been
01:48:03 your ocd so uh no not ocd adhd for projects and i'm pretty sure like you know last month pretty
01:48:10 well convinced me that you are fucking on points once more just make sure to keep being borderline
01:48:15 poor and you'll definitely be good digi if you want to bring back uh best guy ever in digi
01:48:22 review something i'll i'll i'll give you a cheap rate i'll give you a cheap rate for my services
01:48:27 that's what i'll do i'll consider it people um people wanted me to do that with saos return
01:48:32 but i have better ideas fair enough hey i have a total complete left turn topic uh because this
01:48:39 is i don't know where we've been we've been around the world videos like 15 minutes what he okay here
01:48:44 here's the topic uh uh uh skateboarding i am now a skateboarder and it is a huge life upgrade
01:48:51 and i'm better than all of you why that's the topic of is it just because it's a funner way
01:48:56 to like navigate the level geometry of your neighborhood i don't even do it um to get anywhere
01:49:03 i do it purely for fun and also to do pokemon go uh it is the most fun and i mean if it was
01:49:10 a normal skateboard that'd be some pussy shit we're talking about that boosted board that's
01:49:14 that's what i thought i knew that i was like there's no way you're talking about a regular
01:49:17 fucking skateboard no no no certainly not i got it's michelle's skateboard i got it for a birthday
01:49:23 it's a longboard she lets me borrow it you know let the cuck i am uh it's uh just the most fun
01:49:30 thing i've done in a long time i was doing it for hours yesterday i was doing it immediately
01:49:34 before we started filming this episode and i can't wait to go back out immediately after we're done
01:49:39 it just is great and it feels good and it's a perfect temperature and time of year to do it
01:49:45 and also i'm hoping it'll just be somewhat of exercise every single day i shout out like i would
01:49:51 have really i would have gotten into skateboard to me as a kid skateboards were always just the
01:49:56 thing that you do to get tricks and i don't think i would ever use skateboard to do tricks because
01:50:01 i don't care i would just if i were to just get into skateboard as like you know it's a pokemon
01:50:06 go machine dude a part of like exercise and also you know you're out in the world and you're
01:50:11 going slightly faster so you have that joy of going a little bit faster so you're not too fast
01:50:16 i think i would really enjoy it but it was just always the tricks machine to me you also wouldn't
01:50:22 do well on a skateboard i think because uh what is it uh unicycles are rowdy and skateboards are
01:50:27 killer so right i thought you were gonna say that i would be which would also make sense oh that too
01:50:31 i guess that people do skateboard i um shout out to who to the commenter currently typing the
01:50:38 comment about how he got really excited when nate said he was skateboarding and then utterly
01:50:43 furious when he found out it was a boost boosted board oh did you think somebody did that i think
01:50:48 so i think that'll that's probably happen somebody in our audience has to be like a really devout
01:50:52 skateboarder that's probably true i don't know i've uh uh i wore a lot of skater i wore a lot of
01:50:59 jinko jeans as you see as a youth and now finally it's coming full circle as i am the cool guy i was
01:51:06 always destined to be uh yeah it's super fun imagine me uh my my on my boosted board
01:51:13 fucking the the fucking remote in one hand cruising at max speed uh with my pokemon go
01:51:19 app on catching so many fucking magikarp as i cruise by the river and in my other hand
01:51:24 a full tankard of hule just chugging what the hell is your millennial levels are at 12
01:51:32 please draw it everyone please imagine you're looking at everyone that's probably like they're

01:53:39 t-shirt yeah where where tom has cleverly cleverly reinvented the doom logo as a doomer
01:53:45 oh that's good i don't know it looks like this whole digi tom t-shirt industry not really getting
01:53:52 me i don't like the iam game sure it's cool you don't like the iam game well your taste sucks and
01:53:57 you suck i'm into this doomer one i might get this one this is pretty sick i'm fine with like the
01:54:03 next generation being called doomers but i guess they're gonna be called no they're zoomers because
01:54:08 yeah they're zoomers dog generation c they're the zoomers what what is that but like what do they
01:54:14 do that like a kid with like shaved sides of his head uh doing the fortnite dance and i don't know
01:54:22 like at like a carly ray jeppson concert i guess yeah all right look here's here's how i think of it
01:54:28 all right if you if the the if your turning point in your childhood was pokemon you're a doomer if
01:54:35 your turning point your childhood was minecraft you're a zoomer yes that is on point i think we're
01:54:41 gonna be able i ruby and sapphire you're like you're a zoomer okay munchie you're like a you're
01:54:47 like a uh you're like a like a um like very early zoomer i would say you know that i think about
01:54:53 it the raddies and the killers are really just doomers versus zoomers uh at the end of the day
01:54:58 oh dude okay munchie i was actually just yesterday in a debate like where does millennial and and
01:55:03 gen z began and the thing is people are gonna keep debating about it people keep debating when
01:55:08 millennial even starts whether it's the mid or the late eighties but i think what's gonna happen is
01:55:13 it'll be a lot more clear once two parents who are definitively stereotypical millennials have a kid
01:55:19 and then that kid becomes a teenager and begins to express themselves once we see what the new
01:55:24 stereotype is we'll start to then reverse engineer you have to let the generation become old first
01:55:30 we're getting i know i know dude like i mean the zoomers are already like adults now
01:55:34 but like yeah they're getting but when we get to the late era zoomers that's when we'll truly
01:55:38 understand it's some of them are what i'm looking forward to it may not be the zoomers it may be
01:55:42 the kaboomers which will probably be the last one and and it all comes full circle back to boom
01:55:46 right no no it's gonna go back beyond that what i'm thinking is gonna happen is that there's gonna
01:55:51 be like the the generations will keep getting more and more lazy and privileged and entitled and then
01:55:57 there's going to be a reverse polarity when there's like this sudden huge increase of like
01:56:02 religiosity and like discipline for its own sake after like society collapses right and it'll be
01:56:07 the first generation like 200 years where like the children are more those would be the bloomers
01:56:12 the bloomers yeah and there is a generation defined by like our parents are fucking lazy
01:56:17 it's really funny you say that because there is an image of the bloomer that is exactly what
01:56:21 devu is describing what yeah no look up look up bloomer and like you'll get or um i found it in
01:56:28 the like well while searching doomer i found the bloomer it was like a guy with a big smile and
01:56:32 like everything he's like perfectly moral and like i got it i got it right here it's like i oh my god
01:56:37 this is me this is me i'm a bloomer for sure oh it's too fucking small hang on it's actually crazy
01:56:44 that face uh i disgusting i hate that i'm no longer the child soldier there is a person one of my
01:56:53 consorts in the ratty rough house here we paradox crocs the ancient stignitary of urban development
01:56:58 that guy he has a he has a deep voice and he's fucking like i think like 16 years old or he's
01:57:04 going to turn 60 he's a really young lad and it's kind of crazy to me that i have fans who are now
01:57:10 younger than me and i could not be happier and i could not be more thrilled to have paradox crocs
01:57:16 the youngin on my side it's just it's just okay you know what i turned 18 i am now technically
01:57:22 adult and all the reasons why people used to like me they now have no justification they're all god
01:57:27 yeah and and now why they hate and and and now that my middling skills have been exposed as
01:57:33 middling skills and not like oh you know like you're good as like you're good for a kid much you
01:57:37 know you have good art and you have good humor you know for a child now all that is gone and now
01:57:41 they just judge me as a normal person and now i'm when i have no more fans and so i just stay up
01:57:45 every night i just drink gourmet tea and i go to sleep at like 3 a.m and think about how i'm
01:57:50 going to kill myself which is a real yeah that that's the uh yeah really was literally once i turn
01:57:54 24 i rose oh shit i'm no longer young i'm definitely feeling old now it's it's the true uh it's the
01:58:01 real big lie about hunter hunter where because there's so many fucking hiatuses they get to be
01:58:06 wow you are good for a kid gone and killer would get to be for 20 fucking years because
01:58:12 their story progresses so slowly they get to be in that in that nice loop of you know you're not
01:58:16 as good as all of us but for a 14 year old you're pretty fucking good but that period of your life
01:58:22 dwindles away so fucking fast you can't relax i don't i don't consider mungy i have not considered
01:58:28 mungy a child for like three years now like i don't think of you as being good for your age
01:58:34 i just think you are like the best graphic designer i know right anyway so i read the
01:58:40 bloomer meme and i'm reversing direction i completely am okay with this boomer zoomer
01:58:45 doomer meme as long as i get to be a bloomer i endorse let's let listen to this i have to

02:05:11 in the shape of a human and i take umbridge with the pcp member ben saint
02:05:20 good he's not here as ben knows the sequel is never as good as the original and as the original
02:05:28 i have no choice but to inject my venom into his ben saint veins his only hope for survival

02:07:37 it is pretty good wise to your ways uh i was gonna also we release at 2 p.m we should be on
02:07:42 eastern standard time suggestion if you're sending in one where you want like a specific member to
02:07:48 hear it you should probably put that in the title like play this on an episode with ben or something
02:07:53 i've been i've been starting to tag i've got it actually i have one that it was for gib and i'm
02:07:57 just not going to read that because that's like a gib one so i've been trying to do a little bit
02:08:00 better with that but um all right we'll we'll keep working on it all right yeah if you could put in
02:08:05 the in the in your name or title that would be helpful yeah but here's another one this one is
02:08:09 this one is simply called pcp theme 2018-09 uh let's see what we have here
02:08:17 perhaps an update i got a new pcp theme here it goes all right starting up get ready what is that
02:08:27 it sounds like some hit
02:08:37 is this the german national anthem
02:08:43 i gotta find out
02:08:50 the matching lyrics to the other lyrics is very nice
02:08:57 is this is this a song that can get us blocked in germany could this happen is this a hitler song
02:09:03 you know what it probably is um i apologize to all our german listeners who can't hear us
02:09:08 because this episode was just blocked because it's probably that's probably the nazi anthem and
02:09:12 or you're currently getting arrested for having listened to it all right yeah uh all right here
02:09:18 we go yeah that's germany's a kooky play saying it um here we go this one's from uh tomaso choco
02:09:25 oh i think we had a mess from today is the one-year anniversary of me starting my diet
02:09:31 i could help breads rice, potatoes, pastas, and sugar and lost about 150 pounds so i want to
02:09:37 ask you how much you're celebrating the town's probably gonna say go to cuckold's landing but
02:09:41 i don't really like the idea the boy's getting sprung when the southern bells are being rung
02:09:45 so i don't want to do that anyway okay there was a lot there digi and davu i think you missed it
02:09:52 but like i think it was our boy choco taco was like driving through like south caroline or something
02:09:56 and like he said like hey guys if you're still looking for a place to set up pcb hq i just found
02:10:02 a place called cuckold's landing in like south carolina um but anyway this guy lost 150 pounds
02:10:10 in one year since going on a diet it sounded like keto if that's not it was on keto if that's not a
02:10:16 a ringing endorsement for not eating bread ever again i don't know what is bread is just bad for
02:10:23 you it is it really is it's that's that is bread yes scott pilgrim bread and does indeed does make
02:10:29 you fat and it's not no that means truffle gar law from one piece is actually on to something
02:10:34 because he hates bread but fuck that guy uh all right oblivion fall another one let's do it up
02:10:42 mate you are doing this wrong your entire approach with playing these voicemails through soundcloud
02:10:49 is a complete farce and an inefficient solution if you actually cared about doing this right you
02:10:54 would install vb audio cables and voice meter so that way you could play the audio directly
02:10:59 through your microphone to discord with no loss in quality what you can actually do is split the
02:11:06 audio in your computer to different channels and you can toggle which channels come through your
02:11:10 microphone and discord and which channels go through to your headset it turns this is what i want
02:11:15 to hear beastly audio machine dream and you can do so much with it and the best part is you don't
02:11:21 have to waste time on soundcloud and you don't have to delay starfleet from happening with your
02:11:26 stupid inefficient bullshit if you need help setting it up you can contact me i'm on the discord my
02:11:32 username is green you've got to eat your greens god damn it get voice meter you little bitch
02:11:41 that is a super helpful suggestion uh i don't know like will cost money i assume that it will
02:11:47 but i should i should just go reach out to oblivion i i know he i know it's probably just
02:11:51 cuz it it's funny but i've never understood the mentality of people who frame some like incredibly
02:11:58 obscure technology knowledge that you don't have like it's your fault for not knowing it like
02:12:03 how could you possibly not know about vba split gx 17 fucking color arrangement you bitch like
02:12:13 i i appreciate his expertise but please my my fragile this goes back to what you were talking
02:12:17 about earlier about about uh what debu said with like thrash whatever if you don't know the specific
02:12:23 genre like you know this guy just is so into audio it's like yeah i mean he's a music fan so i mean
02:12:28 i'm sure he's doing it because it's funny and maybe he listens to his biggest problem and
02:12:31 is taken out of every voicemail they get that's true uh okay here's another one this is from
02:12:38 truth sayer truth sayer all right i'm ready for the truth lay some truth tick tock tick tock best
02:12:47 guy ever loves the cork well he said the truth i thought it was gonna be like some heavy existential
02:13:02 thing about how time is like fleeting yeah but uh he brought it back and brought it back i feel better
02:13:06 again um okay that was pretty good let's see if we can follow up here's one from iron beaver um
02:13:15 let's let's let's see nate since you want to create the star fleet and the federation and all of that
02:13:21 utility and bullshit i will assume you also want to start all the other things that
02:13:29 lead that will lead us towards the star fleet like a third world war of 2053 um it is true that in
02:13:39 in star trek universe there was a nuclear world war three uh before star fleet got created but
02:13:46 but actually they really could have just because there was like a bunch of history in star trek
02:13:51 where like a bunch of like horrific like dictatorial regimes took over and then world war three happened
02:13:56 and like society kind of collapsed but like what actually made star fleet finally happen
02:14:01 was just like after all that bullshit uh there's a movie one of the star trek movies about this
02:14:06 first contact i think it was just where um key for southerland's dad uh he just invented the warp
02:14:13 drive like just because he was a good science man he just did it and when he activated it during this
02:14:18 like test the volcans who were nearby found them and were like oh shit you guys have the warp drive
02:14:23 and then they made contact and then they became best buds and then they like changed the world
02:14:26 they got post scarcity and then star fleet happened so you actually could just skip all that stuff
02:14:31 probably so it'd be nice to avoid that how did we uh how did we in in mass effect how did
02:14:36 he manage yeah how did we discover the master he discovered prothean ruins on mars yeah they found
02:14:42 that's right that's right that's what they did um there's one more here come on digi it's like the
02:14:47 first thing in the codex yeah no i just couldn't remember off the top of my head i'm so sad like i
02:14:53 want to go back and play mass effects all the way through because like it really is just star trek
02:14:57 only better and for free um and it was just such a joy for me to like play through yeah that's true
02:15:04 it's it was such a joy to play through like the first like couple hours that game with like all the
02:15:08 lore and like like learning about like basically their version of star fleet and like how it all
02:15:12 happened and meeting all the races ah it's a good game good game i wish i was playing it
02:15:18 oh speaking of of mass effect i found out that mass effect and drama is 10 times worse than i ever
02:15:22 would have thought because uh someone in the comments of our iam game stream of it said there
02:15:26 are literally zero quarians in all of andromeda which is like disgusting because the quarians were
02:15:31 fucking sick and they just didn't include them at all i guess they just felt like they wanted to
02:15:37 like cut some of the races and maybe like the quarian story is like kind of over because like
02:15:42 they were like this nomadic guys who oh yeah why would you want to bring people who've been
02:15:46 nomadic forever to a completely unknown galaxy how fucking retarded are you you really don't want
02:15:54 entire race of scavengers and like people who salvage it to go to a completely unknown galaxy
02:15:59 where you have no foothold at all what use could that possibly be maybe they're really sick of it
02:16:05 and they don't want to do it right of course oh god wait a minute wait a minute you know what
02:16:10 i read about that you know i there was one line in that uh bloomer description that i read before
02:16:16 i started to bring this back up it's just i just noticed this as i still had my search for bloomer
02:16:21 i just noticed um like there's others like there was one line in the bloomer thing that was um
02:16:26 what was it love for his people far exceeds any hatred he has ever felt i thought that was a
02:16:30 little weird but didn't you know that was fine then i see another one does it say something about
02:16:35 like jews because these these all originate from pole i think there's a connection to the alt
02:16:40 right with bloomers that i didn't okay this whole meme comes from pole like the doomer
02:16:44 bloomer all that meme it's from pole so uh yeah look look at this bloomer link maybe we're trying
02:16:51 to make it we're trying to expand it beyond the realm of pole because it's going to stay there
02:16:55 i just said like i am a bloomer so many times i didn't anticipate this turn but look look at this
02:17:01 one bloomer's friday night a condom you're funny anon that's not going to secure a future for any
02:17:07 white oh no i didn't expect all all this time we should have known of course yeah i got i bet a
02:17:16 lot of people are going to be like lol he says he's a boomer shit i don't go on polling up to know
02:17:21 which are the good memes and which are the bad memes no this is this is fine it's that that's
02:17:25 what's so great about the doomer meme is that the initial one doesn't have any pole shit if you
02:17:31 read the other ones that other people expanded on it they all added more pole shit in there but like
02:17:36 you know i think this this meme has legs to go beyond it's also on x so it's not just on pole
02:17:43 it's also been we can salvage this one and like when it's like his people i thought i meant like
02:17:47 yo yo me and my people we're like hanging out we're going out tonight you know no no no no that's
02:17:52 how i interpreted it um all right here's one more voicemail from uh chung skingy chung skingy
02:17:59 all right all right be good quick question tell the uh pokemon gore is in the pcp how do i
02:18:04 stop from throwing rocks at me and call me autistic while i play pokemon go
02:18:11 he said how do i get people to stop throwing rocks and calling me autistic while i play pokemon go

02:21:02 other people too uh i like everybody who does great art i haven't memorized any of your names
02:21:08 but you all do great art um there's like a he's a consort fucking fucking you know jade morrow
02:21:15 she's a great artist i don't think she's made anything i was kind of pondering the pokey
02:21:19 conundrum what was the question actually that's the only one i could think of off the top of my head
02:21:23 uh oh i don't know nexus mania obviously i mean he's just a yeah nexus does really great artists
02:21:28 he's all around are we just listening off viewers of the show who we like no we have good art yeah
02:21:33 good art oh people who do art mm people who have who's originally creative content you respect or
02:21:39 yourself a fan of well i'm thinking about it says original creative content so not just their fan art
02:21:45 of pcp but people who's original well i'm just gonna give a shout out to silent k who's completely
02:21:52 saved my ass with getting started on programming and shit currently in the process of like
02:21:58 un fucking a major bug that i have or a major hurdle i have to climb nice that's fucking sick
02:22:03 dude more so than that do we have do we have any rough eta of of the new release date no more
02:22:07 eta's i i had only one very rough eta now that that one's gone it's like taking the half life
02:22:12 re-approach now it's like it's like 99.8% done so all right we've moved up like 0.6%
02:22:19 since the last update then right oh excellent anyway silent k right even more so than being
02:22:24 good at like you know helping out saving my ass on shit he's just uh he's a great person to have
02:22:30 conversations about fucking uh life hacking optimizing your time with so so probably don't
02:22:35 talk to him asking him for life advice because he'd probably be like oh i'm talking to too many people
02:22:39 this is non optimal for my life but he's been really cool with me and he recommended me some
02:22:43 fucking audiobooks which really got me on this whole work smart not hard mentality specifically
02:22:49 deep work by cal newport and why we sleep by i don't remember his name but at some point
02:22:55 i'm just gonna force digi to read or listen to this book because he's one of those like
02:22:59 anti-sleep people this book convinces you oh shit oh no i'm no longer sleep the shorter your life
02:23:05 i am no longer anti-sleep that is not a thing anymore i mean i'm i'm anti-sleep the same way
02:23:10 that i'm anti-death that it's like a biological thing i wish i could rid myself of i've come around
02:23:15 on sleep uh partly because i'm old now and it's okay and it makes me feel good i mean if i were
02:23:21 you i'd be even more angry which is kind of how i feel that my weak human body has these weaknesses
02:23:27 that are getting more and more i mean the thing is when he says anti-sleep it's not just a matter
02:23:31 of i hate sleep it's that i was actively trying to end it that like i was looking for a way out
02:23:36 and now i am right i still feel the ire i feel that i have to waste all this time sleeping sure
02:23:42 but i have i have completely given into it and acknowledge that i need it and that it's okay
02:23:47 we're getting we're getting close you want if you want to have a chance to quell your ire this
02:23:52 book will explain because yes people haven't really understood why we sleep but they're finally starting
02:23:57 to figure it out i understand it now because like uh it it helps me to i mean i know that when
02:24:03 you sleep it like it lets your thoughts reorganize themselves it's kind of like a book goes in
02:24:08 extensive detail exactly like what it does with different parts of your brain and it's
02:24:12 so fucking cool to learn how like like no no okay they did a they did a test and this is written
02:24:18 by a guy who's like a sleep scientist so this isn't like a whole lot of oh hey i read an article
02:24:22 that said this about a study it's i did this fucking study where they had people in a sleep
02:24:28 laboratory read a bunch of facts and they put in a green r for remember and a and a red f for
02:24:36 forget next to every fact that they learned right they told them that means remember that means
02:24:42 forget but you actually want you to remember all of them equally ignore the forget and remember
02:24:48 had them go to sleep woke up the next day and they overwhelmingly remembered the shit that had
02:24:54 the green r for remember more than the red f for forget so the brain is able to process memories
02:25:01 overnight and it actually operates intelligently we may not have conscious control over it but we
02:25:05 are actually able to control what our brain does at night even if not like consciously directly
02:25:12 yeah i uh i believe all that i'm sleep fascinates me because uh some recent things that happen in
02:25:22 my life were caused by lack of sleep and it's it's very similar to when a computer has like
02:25:29 when it sounds like a memory leak and everything just like is wrong that's exactly what happens
02:25:33 to your brain if you don't sleep for long enough it's like it's not that you're at risk of dying
02:25:38 because you're not like rested it's that your brain just is confused and doesn't know where to put
02:25:43 all the information into what holes you know and it's just like it fucking goes haywire and like
02:25:48 now that i've been sleeping more regularly it's like i can i can also like now that i know this
02:25:55 like ever since like kind of realizing the fact that because somebody told me i guess at some point
02:26:00 that like your dreams are like reorganization of your thoughts and so like in spite of the fact
02:26:05 that i complain about us talking about dreams on the show because i think that
02:26:09 dreams don't mean anything to other people unless they know what's going on in your life
02:26:14 very particularly but if if you look at your dreams interpretively like usually i can look
02:26:20 back on my dream and say okay i know exactly what this was about like this it's all metaphorical
02:26:25 but i know exactly why i had this dream because like this is something that was either stressing me
02:26:30 out or this is something that uh and like you know if i reverse engineer it it makes perfect sense
02:26:36 in in terms of a metaphor you know uh anyway enough for this i don't want to talk about this
02:26:40 anymore kajoro bitter thorn asks which one of you is the most games this is the most important
02:26:46 question it's either a better name i want to say tom i'm pretty games i'm pretty games i don't know
02:26:51 i think ben is the most games in the pcp ben's probably the most games does he play i mean
02:26:57 why well what's your justification that he is the best at games ben is not the best at games
02:27:03 i'm the best at games god damn it i'm definitely the best at games tell that to the pokemon race
02:27:13 i won the dark souls race destroy ben was in the curvy race too though he did win the thing is
02:27:19 like i've seen not only does ben play games that like i can't even conceive of how the rules work
02:27:25 like like dwarf fortress and in fucking dungeon crawl stone soup but like there was that time
02:27:31 that uh me him and davu did a let's play of downwell and he hadn't played it in like six months and
02:27:36 he got to like the final boss on his first fucking try that she does get in the record the game
02:27:41 sometimes and also he like did a pretty good job at toho on like his first or second like like he
02:27:48 did like one game over ever playing it yeah what difficulty was it on i think it was on normal but
02:27:54 like he got a few levels in on like his first time ever playing toho which is like that's not that's
02:27:59 like that's like main character of story level of skill if you know what i mean okay ben's pretty
02:28:03 good at games but i'm better at action games and i'll run circles around him in kingdom hearts too
02:28:09 what i have to say hey listen to this question multi-player games maybe i don't really know i think
02:28:15 i've been catching my virtue of none of you playing online yeah i don't play tf2 or anything
02:28:20 so i i bet i could beat all of you at smash uh i don't think maybe when when ultimate comes out
02:28:29 it's gonna be yeah we have a switch now so i guess we'll find out i'm talking about melee i'm talking
02:28:32 about actual smash i could beat all of you an actual smash hey they say that this one looks pretty
02:28:38 good we got we've got directional air dodges back that's cool that's cool uh you don't carry your
02:28:44 running momentum into jumps it's retarded that's in don't that's in the original super mario bros on
02:28:50 ness oh that's rough that's uh that's rough hey okay listen to this question i love this question
02:28:57 this is fascinating i think it is from a female zoomer i believe that you can i mean that's my
02:29:02 assumption but we'll we'll see it's from at infinity rise one and they ask uh is it extra
02:29:08 to buy my that's how i could tell it to zoomer asking a question like that is it extra to buy
02:29:13 my crush the smash edition switch we're good friends and he knows i like him so yeah too much
02:29:21 or just do it don't weigh too much why the fuck are you doing way over the top dude you are a girl
02:29:27 okay not you are a girl if he's not already into you that's weird um i would wonder why that's the
02:29:34 case um i we're talking about like a three hundred dollar console right yeah i would not like so
02:29:41 just clearly buy i would not buy my best friend or no i wouldn't buy anyone that unless they were
02:29:47 sucking my cock at that moment yeah that's what i get to that's what i get to what i'm not i'm not
02:29:52 trying to stay like he'll never like you or like it's a loss you shouldn't have to buy like material
02:29:57 wealth to get someone to like you that's not how you shouldn't have to buy someone's affection
02:30:01 buying anything for someone because you want that are like you yeah like like you just
02:30:06 here's my advice show them a little thigh you show them a little just do that with smash underneath
02:30:13 it's not it's not it's not an issue of it being extra it's an issue of if that does work then you're
02:30:18 in a bad relationship if you know he's right because you bought him a switch that's fucked dude
02:30:24 by the way i'm assuming it's a girl because she said it's a he i mean it could be a gay guy i'm
02:30:27 just assuming here but like by the way if it is a gay man then go for it because i mean it is
02:30:34 different if it's if it's a man and he is like on the fence about being gay buy that switch
02:30:42 and maybe maybe you'll convince him if you buy okay i know he's on twitter i can never know
02:30:48 give him smash the hill make the match girl so i'm just assuming that that yeah if you are a girl
02:30:53 like don't believe what nate said oh if a guy doesn't like a girl there's something wrong i think
02:30:58 there are a lot of guys who will like any girl who likes them but yeah i think it's like you know
02:31:03 there's sort of a mad toxic masculinity pressure to act like every guy is like that you know like
02:31:09 so i don't think all guys are like that i don't think i just mean like like what the real situation
02:31:17 is like if you're a girl you've got like a friend who's a guy and like you're into him
02:31:21 and like you want like to make it a romantic thing the solution is definitely not to like just buy
02:31:27 him presents and like hope that he makes the switch it's to in some more like court like like
02:31:32 full part full way you have to make yourself like clearly just show that you are romantically
02:31:37 interested but here's the part of the tweet that concerns me is that they said they already know
02:31:42 that they're interested right in which case i mean if if oh my god you're right i forgot about that
02:31:48 knows that you're interested and they don't like you then the only conceivable solution
02:31:53 is that you tell them more about yourself and maybe they like you based on that stuff but but
02:31:59 even then don't go too far down that road i just like if they already know about you like if they
02:32:04 already know enough about you to make a judgment on whether they like you or not then you're already
02:32:09 this has red flag written all over i'm sorry it's rough yeah that's just the way it is
02:32:14 buying them presents this sounds like a lost cause almost it will only make them feel weird
02:32:18 or if it doesn't then they might have sinister intentions they're gonna try and i i suspect
02:32:23 look guys are very simple i'll say this about guys like a guy knows at first glance with a girl
02:32:29 if he's willing to date her or not for the most part that's true and i don't know hey uh i haven't
02:32:35 the odds are he's not attracted to you buy smash buy a switch for yourself invite him over to play it
02:32:43 and see if he likes you you know that's the way don't do it only because you have this plan you
02:32:47 have to also want this way to the very least yeah it's just not it's not extra it's just retarded
02:32:55 that question was good that's what extra means well i mean kind of that question was good but
02:32:59 here's a way better one from at doom box two who i recommend buying the doomer shirt asks
02:33:05 best way to cook eggs fried i like fry fry keep that yoke runny as hell my dude runny as hell uh
02:33:12 that's okay i think it's like okay first uh fried egg second uh scrambled uh but if you
02:33:18 want to go the extra like what is the best egg dish carbonara hands down oh uh whatever it was
02:33:24 that me you uh and digi had at that breakfast place it's on an english muffin with the egg on top
02:33:31 with like a piece of ham eggs benedict is the best egg food in the world i'm convinced i'm convinced
02:33:38 i'm gonna show you carbonara i'm gonna show you you're gonna like it okay all right i guarantee it
02:33:42 you're not the way you look you're gonna get 50 pounds you're gonna like the way you just so
02:33:47 everyone knows i'm just gonna give you the just the real simple way to cook a fried egg properly
02:33:51 uh there's a video of itachi doing this from naruto somewhere online as well oh that's that's
02:33:56 true that's there's a thing of that um is that where it started for you what what is that is that
02:34:01 where your love of fried egg started no but i was happy to be you know uh reinforced by itachi's
02:34:07 love of it you just you take your pan yeah you turn on the heat real low yeah you spread your
02:34:12 oil you spread it around yeah you can turn up the heat a little bit if you want and you crack your
02:34:15 egg in the center you can put two or three or whatever and then you have this is the most
02:34:19 important part you put the lid on top you have to put a lid on top so that it cooks the top of the egg
02:34:25 but you don't do it too you don't turn the heat up too long and then you just like really i'm just
02:34:29 trying to tell you to put the lid on the top because that was the most important thing i learned
02:34:33 i can see long hair you reminded me of taking notes of this anime scene you reminded me of a
02:34:39 itachi did it too from a really early pcp episode where we were talking about like life and uh just
02:34:45 you know making the best of yourself something like that and you chimed in with you know that
02:34:49 reminds me there's a really great chapter of one piece about this that really adjusted
02:34:54 my life view of this and i and i just have ever since then i've imagined you as like a man in
02:34:58 the library that the grandchildren come to for wisdom and your library is just a shitload of
02:35:04 jump volumes and it's like oh it's just as this bloomer thing describes nostalgia motivates him
02:35:09 instead of depressing don't forget very racist at the risk of this being uh at the risk of this
02:35:15 potentially being a whole other topic like i i think um there's this common sentiment people
02:35:21 have or they're like you have to read to like you have to read because it'll enrich your understanding
02:35:25 of the world and you'll learn so much from reading but they always say books like this is implication
02:35:31 that only books can do this for you and like books are literally no fucking different from any other
02:35:38 medium like well they do stimulate the brain in a pretty good way i think i'm absolutely gonna
02:35:43 turn this into a into a topic or i do definitely have a thing to say about that books don't automatically
02:35:48 change anything but the fact that there's a different business model means there could have been
02:35:52 a very different production model let me tell you that's true but i just think that like i'm talking
02:35:56 about just on the baseline people talk about it like only books have this power and it's like right
02:36:02 all media has this power because it all comes from the same fucking place it's all just remember
02:36:07 our boy ty Lopez the the the the read a book a day guy who actually just like has people summarized
02:36:13 books for or something yeah yeah like dude no no like the thing about books though is that
02:36:18 it's just the amount of options and the amount of just the odds of stumbling into something
02:36:23 that's like holy shit like level of effort and insight in depth is higher than youtube videos and
02:36:29 the example i'm gonna go to is i agree with that but i think that okay i don't think that there's
02:36:35 anything you can't learn from like just consuming like even fairly basic shit
02:36:43 because you just can extrapolate from it like typically like let's say reading one piece again
02:36:48 like Nate might see it might not be presented with a huge amount of depth in the in one piece
02:36:55 but like it might present you with an idea that you can then think about and extrapolate on and
02:37:00 add that depth to by thinking about it and like i think that that's just like what me like we all
02:37:07 learn like most of the fucking shit we know from like most of what we consume because it's not like
02:37:12 any of it comes from a place of mindlessness like every story is just somebody taking their
02:37:18 understanding of the world and translating that into a story and all of our understanding is
02:37:23 pretty fucking similar because we're all there is an extent to which like people will go out of
02:37:27 their way to do a crazy fucking research project and go out and be a journalist and get original
02:37:32 interviews to attain information and it's like a lot sometimes people turn that into a youtube video
02:37:37 but sometimes they turn that into a book and you gotta get the book if you want the full story
02:37:42 what i want to bring up is Good to Great by Jim Collins which was an audiobook that was so good
02:37:47 i'm like i need to stop listening to audiobooks now before i get into a munchies mom loop of
02:37:51 just listening to books about how to make life better and never actually getting around to it
02:37:55 whatever that i'll devotee you're my oh my god so i almost forgot i'm sorry to move here finish
02:38:00 your point that i've got something to say so Good to Great by Jim Collins was written from the
02:38:05 mid to late 90s with not just Jim Collins but a team of 20 or 22 different research people he had an
02:38:14 entire fucking like like an entire fucking class of people who were doing research for five years
02:38:21 to examine every fucking business in america and crunched thousands and thousands and thousands of
02:38:28 data to attain a very selected highly curated sample set of companies that were mediocre and then
02:38:36 became great later so that they could look at the common elements and just the amount of data
02:38:40 that they amassed an amount of math that they crunched and then the uniqueness of the insights
02:38:46 that they pulled out of that you know you can't if you decided to make that a youtube video well
02:38:50 to live in five let me ask you something book you gotta get the book do you think that i would get
02:38:55 significantly more out of reading this book than i would out of if you just explain to me what the
02:39:00 book said yeah i mean in like 15 i probably not because like because i often people will tell me
02:39:07 things like uh like there's a lot of academic books that like i've seen youtube videos that
02:39:13 explain the point of them and like you always get this impression like most of the book is just
02:39:18 justifying the point but like the point can be made in like a sentence but it's a but it's important
02:39:31 that the book exists but is it important that i read the book if i if i already take it for granted
02:39:38 that the point it's making is correct because i know that it was justified by the text because
02:39:43 people i trust have told me as much will i get anything more out of reading the book and having
02:39:47 it readjustified for me then if i just i think i understand your own thoughts better if you take
02:39:52 the book yeah it helps you internalize the information not yeah that's what i was gonna say
02:39:56 like i think i think you've all spoken at the same time and i didn't know what any of the fact that
02:40:00 you're reading it like firsthand i think it helps you internalize and like retain the information
02:40:04 better what it's also is that you understand like if you if someone tells you the moral of a story
02:40:10 or you know the point of a book and then you you in turn believe that and put that into your life
02:40:15 then you're not gonna know why you believe things if you just take what people say is like oh yeah
02:40:19 the book was about since what i don't know why i believe that gravity is real other than that it's
02:40:24 a thing i can look at and be like that's a thing like i don't look at gravity it could be bullshit
02:40:29 everyone was telling you your whole life i don't need to read a book on what is gravity to know
02:40:34 that gravity is a thing you know why do i need a greater understanding this is your smart so
02:40:42 you're not dumb as shit is why why do i want to be smart what's the benefit being able to better
02:40:49 articulate any ideas i don't i don't even know how to respond to that well you justify it in your
02:40:53 worldview i suppose you do it you you basically justify how 99.9 of everything that everyone
02:41:00 says you need to do in life to be happy you don't you can just skip it and you do and i guess it works
02:41:04 so i guess i guess digi's mentality about books he's talking about right now is answers the question
02:41:09 we were talking about early about media and why people don't expand their taste it's like well
02:41:13 who cares why do i need to be you know nuance in my taste there is there is no need however what
02:41:19 i'm advocating for in that is that people will find something they will like more like that they
02:41:25 i think you like books more i think people are limit well forget about that because i'm this is
02:41:31 all of just me postulating this is for the sake of argument none of this is real i don't actually
02:41:36 feel these things i'm saying i'm making an argument and why are we talking about it yeah
02:41:41 and also why is there not this episode is over forget it fuck you guys okay i don't want to make
02:41:45 you know what in that point 245 into the goddamn episode i've got a surprise announcement at the
02:41:51 end of the episode that i meant to bring up our hero at call me puzzle happily just tweeted
02:41:57 that it is international podcast day right oh i forgot about that yeah i i i post that i post
02:42:03 that in chat i was like oh my god guys it's gonna be national podcast day and then it was like oh
02:42:07 i require that day oh and i was like yeah well i remembered didn't i i i remembered not you you
02:42:13 baby you you twink uh well uh so eat it guys our podcast good are they were are they worthwhile
02:42:21 as an art form do they impact society let's do do this for 45 minutes okay it's like about the
02:42:27 the social benefits of podcasting and if they're morally right i think a lot of people can waste
02:42:32 a ton of time with podcasts as they do everything for example i was listed yeah that is true i was
02:42:38 listening to a sam harris podcast the uh yesterday because the title was something like safe space
02:42:44 culture i listened for five minutes it was clear that they signaled that they agreed with my position
02:42:49 that they're bullshit and then i continued to listen to just feel good about them justifying my
02:42:54 opinion this is exactly what i was just saying about books by the way is that like because every
02:42:59 time for any media every time i like go and read the study that like the the result was from i'm
02:43:04 just like oh this is just literally saying the thing like i already i already know that the thing
02:43:10 why am i reading the thing that's about the thing because you understand why the thing is i don't
02:43:15 i don't need to it has no application to know why it is all right all right fine but here
02:43:19 is my point like if i listen to a podcast and then they clearly signal that they believe something i
02:43:24 don't believe odds are just much higher that i'll stop listening and i think a lot of people are
02:43:29 that way so i just wonder if we really do a lot of convincing people of anything with these uh
02:43:34 we don't you know with these i don't know those types of videos i mean those are very like you
02:43:39 too okay youtube political videos are so fucking bad they make me so like embarrassed
02:43:45 on like a visceral well it's the problem with all of them is just you can tell what side the people
02:43:50 are on and like that's that's why i think it's i think if you want to change anybody's mind
02:43:55 stop being on a side obviously like because like nobody's gonna really believe one is right though
02:44:03 there's a difference between people who are not on a side do it through peril or something like
02:44:07 you're never going to get to the other side from a reporter i think people who vote democrat and vote
02:44:14 republic i'm gonna get real fucking specific here okay i don't think is this gonna be another
02:44:18 topic because i've got to piss real bad all right well okay well if you want to if you want to hear
02:44:23 real quick finish your point yeah all i'm gonna say is that i don't think anyone is like literally
02:44:28 believes everything that the major parties do and they all are just a mishmash of different ideas
02:44:34 and they should just embrace that everyone is different there isn't a clear red or blue
02:44:38 you all right i'm sure you democrat have some republican views i'm sure you republican have
02:44:42 some democrat views so stop fighting each other easier to think that way yeah politics is a sport
02:44:48 for some reason humans human thinking tends to always go towards binary that's why everything
02:44:53 always breaks down to a or b and like business and everything else that's why you have coca
02:44:57 pepsi or intel or amd or democrat republican it's easy to be i'm either a or b we're just
02:45:02 that's why that's why there are no more great people that's why everyone there's a cap because
02:45:06 of the nsa and uh let's go all right well that being said uh the end everyone's bad everyone's
02:45:13 shit uh except i'm a bloomer so everything's great and secure our future for the white race
