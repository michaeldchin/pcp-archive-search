00:00:00 Hello, Ashen One, and welcome to the latest Pro Crastinators Podcast. On this episode we'll
00:00:17 be talking about Dark Souls 3. There will be massive spoilers for the entire game. If
00:00:26 you give a shit about bullshit like that, don't watch this video. I mean, really, you
00:00:33 won't understand half of what we're saying if you haven't played the game. And it's
00:00:39 a really fucking good game. We all thought it was a 10 out of 10. So just play it, and
00:00:47 enjoy the podcast.
00:00:52 Hello everybody, and welcome to the Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am your host, Digibro, to talk about
00:00:58 Dark Souls 3. I've got with me Jesse Endless Jess. Say hello, Jesse. Hello. How's it going?
00:01:10 And I've got the best guy ever as well. Hey guys, what's going on? Ready to get
00:01:14 swole in the dark? We decided we're trying to make this podcast
00:01:20 Let me cut and break in for a sec, because there's a lot of talking over people going
00:01:23 on. We want to avoid that as much as possible from here on out. So maybe less people might
00:01:27 be better. By the way, happy Mother's Day to all the
00:01:30 MILFs in our audience. I know there's a lot of you. Happy Mother's Day that we're recording
00:01:35 this and this podcast won't come out for a week and a half. That's true. If there's
00:01:38 one thing I want to do more of in all my online pursuits, it's attract real women into having
00:01:46 real sex with me. So now's my quick plug for that. So MILFs, shout out to you today.
00:01:50 You're the only one here who hasn't done it. You fucking jump.
00:01:54 Had sex via... that's not due to online stuff. That's true. One day. You could be the first
00:01:59 ladies, get in line.
00:02:01 Alright, so we're talking about Dark Souls 3 today. I think we all really like this game
00:02:08 a lot.
00:02:09 Sure do. And that's why we're doing this. It's like the coolest game ever. It's fucking
00:02:14 rad.
00:02:15 I haven't played since Dark Souls 1 probably.
00:02:18 But it's still a 10 out of 10.
00:02:20 Jesse, I'm curious about your issues with it because you have been the most crazy of
00:02:25 this game from the beginning. I've never heard you complain about it really. So what is your...
00:02:32 I guess my main complaint, none of my complaints are huge complaints.
00:02:39 But I like the fact that in Dark Souls 1 and 2, as soon as you start the game, there's
00:02:44 like 3 or 4 different directions you can go. And this game doesn't branch off until...
00:02:48 Well let me refute that right off, because in Dark Souls 2 that's not the case. That's
00:02:51 only true in Dark Souls 1.
00:02:52 What the fuck are you talking about you stupid idiot? Yes it is.
00:02:54 No it's not. You can't go down the well. You can go one way.
00:02:57 You don't know anything about Dark Souls 2. You Gebronies always run your mouths about
00:03:00 Dark Souls 2. I'm already mad. It's been 5 minutes. You always run your mouths about
00:03:05 Dark Souls 2.
00:03:06 There are two ways.
00:03:07 You don't know a goddamn thing about it. You're not a fucking Dark Souls 2 master like me.
00:03:08 That's true.
00:03:09 So shut your damn mouth and know your damn role.
00:03:11 Okay well maybe that's true. I can definitely agree with you with one. Dark Souls 3 is the
00:03:16 most linear of them all. That is true. I looked at a big map that shows like a flowchart
00:03:20 of the ways you can go. There aren't that many optional areas, though there weren't
00:03:25 really that many of the others. And the chart goes pretty straightforwardly.
00:03:28 I would definitely say the first time I played through it I was struck by how linear it felt.
00:03:33 It's really not. I mean when you're in the Crucifixion Woods you can go either fight
00:03:38 the Abyss Watchers or go to the Cathedral of the Deep.
00:03:40 That's right.
00:03:41 There's always spoilers for everything in this podcast.
00:03:42 Oh yeah.
00:03:43 Gonna spoil it all.
00:03:44 No real sense in making podcasts.
00:03:45 That's good because the lore is great and there are some great, I bet there's some stuff
00:03:49 you guys don't even know. If you haven't done all the threads, all the quest threads and
00:03:53 I can't wait to talk about them because they're awesome.
00:03:56 I would say that like when I started up my New Game Plus the very first thing I did was
00:04:02 in the first area go kill the old lady who gives you the cup and then it makes you fight
00:04:06 the dancer as soon as you kill her. So then I fought the dancer and I went up through
00:04:09 the castle and did the castle stuff before anything else in the game.
00:04:14 So that was definitely cool because it made it so, I couldn't imagine trying to do that
00:04:18 on a brand new game unless you were like extremely pro tier and you really wanted the challenge.
00:04:23 Yeah, it's preventative in the sense that you're severely underleveled doing it on
00:04:28 a non-New Game Plus and it doesn't want you to do it really but you can do it if you're
00:04:33 good enough.
00:04:34 But it was cool to do on New Game Plus because it was right away, whereas the whole game
00:04:40 I would say this game is kind of easy compared to the other Dark Souls games especially on
00:04:44 New Game Plus where you were like, I don't know, I was super overpowered for like all
00:04:49 of this game and when I started up New Game Plus I immediately went and fought like all
00:04:53 the hardest bosses at the beginning. You know, like I fought the dancer, I fought the dragon,
00:04:58 the blind dragon Osiros, I fought the living armor and you know, killed all of them.
00:05:04 Well you said you did it right at the beginning but you can't even get there until like most
00:05:07 of the way through the game.
00:05:08 Like Osiros is like buried way down and fucking, I don't know, somewhere, I don't know, it's
00:05:13 going to take you like five, six hours to get there even if you're making a fucking
00:05:16 B-line.
00:05:17 What do you mean? I'll talk about from New Game Plus.
00:05:18 Yeah, you can't just walk straight there, you gotta fucking unlock the paths and shit.
00:05:22 But the only thing you have to do is you start off in the castle area on the wall, the high
00:05:29 wall of Lothric, you run in, you kill the old lady and that makes the dancer spawn and
00:05:33 then once you kill the dancer you can just run.
00:05:35 Oh shit, I forgot it was down that path, yeah you're right.
00:05:37 I was wrong.
00:05:38 So you can just run in there and kill Osiros and I even went to the burned out version
00:05:43 of the shrine, a Firelink shrine.
00:05:45 I did all that shit like right at the beginning of New Game Plus, which was cool because those
00:05:51 bosses all drop a fuck ton of souls and when you start New Game Plus your biggest problem
00:05:55 is that it takes a lot of souls to level you so by fighting all the hardest bosses first
00:06:00 I had like a shit ton of souls.
00:06:01 The only thing you can't do is you can't go into the, like you can't get into the grand
00:06:05 archives until you have all of the other bosses killed.
00:06:09 So you can't go fight the brothers and all that shit until you've killed all the bosses.
00:06:14 So it did feel like once I was on New Game Plus I did get to play it in a significantly
00:06:18 different enough way that it was like yeah cool it's not exactly the same but now that
00:06:23 I've done a few more new game runs it really is like man this is a pretty linear game.
00:06:29 Your choices are you either do Cathedral of the Deep or you do the Abyss Watchers first.
00:06:34 But let's set this in the context of the Soulsborne series because before this was Bloodborne,
00:06:42 before that was Dark Souls 2 and before that was Dark Souls 1.
00:06:44 So like most people are playing this game coming off of playing Bloodborne and so that's
00:06:48 kind of the way that I was comparing things and I gotta say I've played Dark Souls 1 and
00:06:53 2 and Bloodborne recently and Dark Souls 3 definitely feels more like Bloodborne just
00:06:59 in the sense of the quickness of your movements and the way your character moves and all of
00:07:04 that is really good.
00:07:05 It is different so I could see someone not liking it.
00:07:08 It feels a little bit less deliberate but I definitely like it and it's kind of got
00:07:12 the faster pace of Bloodborne with the vast weapon variety of the Dark Souls series and
00:07:21 they've incorporated this new ability with the L2 what are they called like Focus Attacks
00:07:25 which add a whole bunch of extra shit.
00:07:27 Man I just got this sword.
00:07:28 I didn't even know this was the thing this is how great this game is.
00:07:31 I just beat the game again on New Game Plus.
00:07:33 I walk up to Ludelith who can like fuse souls and like it just so happened I didn't even
00:07:39 know this was a thing.
00:07:41 You have the option of fusing if you've made both of the Princess Swords from the Princess
00:07:45 and the Castle he'll fuse them into one super sword that can do both of their special attacks
00:07:50 with the L2 commands.
00:07:51 I did not know that there was a guy who can fuse swords I've never heard of it.
00:07:57 That's the thing he can only do it with this one weapon and I just happened to stumble upon
00:08:01 it.
00:08:02 Wait who does this?
00:08:03 Who fuses the swords?
00:08:04 Ludelith like the guy who fuses and who turns souls into weapons he just fuses it was the
00:08:07 coolest thing ever.
00:08:08 I'm just saying like there's all this shit there's it's it's got the touch still you
00:08:12 know it's got it all.
00:08:14 I don't I anyway like I just wanted to ask you guys how you felt about like the controls
00:08:19 in comparison to you know the other games because I really like the way it's moving
00:08:23 even though this is like probably the last souls they're making for a long time which
00:08:28 makes me very sad.
00:08:29 Makes me angry they should be a new souls game every year for the rest of my game.
00:08:32 I would have absolutely no problem with them churning out a game of this nature every single
00:08:37 year I want that these are great there's no problem and yet they decide to end it.
00:08:41 Well they said that they're ending the souls franchise that they're working on a new IP
00:08:46 I mean that could be another bloodborne for all we know like another game that's yeah
00:08:50 the same kind of mechanics but different you know I wouldn't mind getting like like personally
00:08:56 I'm okay with like souls itself being over because I felt like this game was the ultimate
00:09:02 one you know like if they wanted to because like what was cool about bloodborne was that
00:09:06 it was the same kind of game but it had such different mechanics to it that it was like
00:09:11 you know you could play it for different reasons like I think with with the previous games
00:09:17 each one was kind of similar enough that you would just play whichever one was your favorite
00:09:21 you know but where like bloodborne is different enough that you might play that one for just
00:09:26 because you want a different experience and I think it would be cool if we got some more
00:09:29 games like that maybe something even more in the direction of like a platinum game style
00:09:35 thing with like more action and like fast-paced stuff or maybe something even more fucking
00:09:41 deep and complex you know but I definitely think that like from soft is moving in the
00:09:47 way of maybe just understanding controls better like I don't I wonder how much the like demons
00:09:56 souls was clunky because that made it easier to make a deep combat system you know yeah
00:10:03 I mean there's there's always trade-offs with stuff like that like like the weapon or no
00:10:08 is it like the item weight limits that was in demon souls one like nobody likes that
00:10:12 but like it does add an additional layer of depth to things yeah it's just you know I'll
00:10:17 say that I think so if I were to summarize what I think like Dark Souls 3 did overall
00:10:23 like compared to the other games it's that it really streamlines everything and yeah but
00:10:28 while I think like bloodborne streamlined it but then also was like really different where
00:10:33 it was more of this like fast-paced you know aggressive type of game but with Dark Souls 3
00:10:39 it's like they made the the fact that there's bonfires like everywhere you never have to
00:10:43 like run all the way back to a boss they took out exceedingly generous with the bonfires a
00:10:49 little bit more than I thought was appropriate or necessary right but I really felt like this
00:10:53 game was meant for the long term because like I think with with demon souls that game was
00:10:58 super fucking memorable like everything about it was the most memorable thing ever because you
00:11:03 would go through it a hundred fucking times like if you died you had to play the whole level again
00:11:07 yeah even you know even if you died to the boss you had to play all the way back to the
00:11:12 boss every single time and every level was so distinct that that it kind of got away with
00:11:17 that because it was like such a you know engrossing game but I think that once Dark Souls 1 came out
00:11:24 and you had the shortcuts and it was easier to get back to bosses and it felt more like well
00:11:29 I mean there were shortcuts and demon souls too right but I mean like yeah I mean that's
00:11:34 definitely true but I think with Dark Souls it was just generally you didn't have to run
00:11:39 back quite as much that's true that's true and I think that Dark Souls also with the flask system
00:11:45 like with demon souls if you died a whole bunch of times to the same boss you had to then go fucking
00:11:50 spend a year grinding grass again you know yeah so they introduced this flask system so that no
00:11:55 matter how many times you died you always started off on the same foot you know you never had to
00:11:59 like completely restart the flask system is genius it's the it's the best it's the best so I think
00:12:05 that was already sort of an effort to streamline it but even in Dark Souls there's a lot of moments
00:12:10 where there's there's not a bonfire for a long time they had hidden bonfires like really
00:12:14 dickishly hidden bonfires you know like the one in the fucking forest like if you didn't hit that
00:12:21 illusory wall yeah find that bonfire I beat the game twice before I figured out how to get to the
00:12:25 bottom of the forest yeah right it took me a long time to figure that you know the one in the right
00:12:31 before the area where the the giant is throwing bombs in the top of the snake fortress sends
00:12:36 fortress there's one way up top there and if you don't find that one you have to go through the
00:12:39 whole fucking trap filled fortress yeah it's just it's fun but I always would I would always see
00:12:44 like items down there oh yeah yeah like I fucking went through the game twice going like how the
00:12:50 fuck where is it how do I get there and finally where exactly are you talking about the uh the
00:12:56 bottom layer of the uh of the forest place that you have to get through like where the hydra is
00:13:01 you have to like go through like a secret tree wall or some shit I don't remember like uh near
00:13:07 the gateway to uh I don't know where there's like a where there's the living tree I think I know what
00:13:11 he's talking about yeah anyways it's a pile of shit it's the worst game ever they're all yeah
00:13:17 yeah that's right but yeah like that's the thing like that game it had stuff like that and I think
00:13:21 that was great I think it made it a really memorable and cool game that you had this like harsh experience
00:13:26 but you never get that again when you play it again you know you once you've beaten dark souls
00:13:31 and once you know all the secrets you know them forever and then all those things that are kind
00:13:36 of a pain in the ass become a real pain in the ass because like you know the first time you're
00:13:41 playing everything's equally hard and it's it's never like a matter of well I had to run back a
00:13:46 thousand times here I just raped I'm playing it right now and I just raped the dancer she's fucking
00:13:51 dead she was no match for my magic for my dark powers of sorcery from the another world the
00:13:58 boba duke spook I kill her with the wizard safe take her yeah by the way I meant to mention this
00:14:04 earlier but you should be following endless jessie's channel the blue glow where he's been playing
00:14:09 dark souls 3 and my channel digi bros where we've been playing dark souls 3 uh I would say jessie's
00:14:14 is more memorable though because his characters are quite a sight they're rich and yeah well that
00:14:21 leaves me as deep as real dark souls character yeah the uh the uh the blue glow lore is becoming
00:14:26 quite masterful the time is convoluted on uh the endless that's true that's very true that leads me
00:14:34 to my other much larger complaint that I didn't even realize was wait wait wait can I finish the
00:14:39 point I was making real quick because I actually forgot to wrap it up just that that like so you
00:14:45 know when I for me when I played through dark souls one because I played through all these
00:14:48 pretty recently the hardest part for me the most frustrating was an Orlando because there's that huge
00:14:54 run back to the bot like from whichever bonfire you pick like you always have to run this massive
00:14:59 distance and I thought it was such a pain in the ass to have to do that and so like with dark souls
00:15:04 3 I really think they were thinking about it in like long term like it's not as memorable the first
00:15:10 time through like in dark souls where you really struggled and you really had to run all the way
00:15:14 back because they put bonfires everywhere but I think that in repeated playthroughs this game
00:15:21 will be the least frustrating and the easiest to come back to and I think that might be what they
00:15:25 were going for because at this point it's like we already have the old games you know if you
00:15:30 you've already had that experience of the the epic frustrating intense game and anyone who
00:15:37 anyone who doesn't hasn't played the old ones isn't going to be that like like if they make a new
00:15:41 game and it's more accessible than like any of the people who couldn't make it through dark souls
00:15:46 one this is the one they're gonna play anyway okay I mean I guess you could maybe interpret it that
00:15:50 way but then I see bonfires like like when you kill the uh the what is it like the dragon slayer
00:15:55 armor and then you run up the hill and there's another bonfire right there it's just like that's
00:15:59 just stupid why did you put that well it's stupid but at the same time the dragon slayer
00:16:04 bonfire is the one that's the fastest way back to the brothers once you open up that shortcut
00:16:09 so no that's fine I mean you leave the dragon slayer one and you just don't put that other
00:16:13 one there in front of that building you you yeah I mean they can they can handle the extra two
00:16:16 second walk just I don't know I definitely think it looked goofy and like really at that moment
00:16:23 you know um yeah but I I think I think honestly they could have just moved that dragon slayer
00:16:29 bonfire to the other end of the bridge and that would have been like because it's as it stands
00:16:35 it's only so much more convenient because you still have to run across the whole fucking bridge
00:16:39 to get to the elevator that goes to the brothers so like no matter what you've got a fairly long run
00:16:43 so I was like why did you even put these two bonfires so close together if uh if it wasn't
00:16:47 going to be that much more convenient that's very true I suggest what was your next complaint you
00:16:53 wanted to bring oh yeah okay I didn't even realize that I had this complaint because it's like a
00:16:57 class specific complaint and I'm not the only one people are flipping out about this like Dark Souls
00:17:03 fans is it about the magic no it's uh because the first time you know I made my guy I usually go
00:17:09 for like a dex kind of build I had my fucking dancer swords it was cool as shit I was like all
00:17:14 right then the next one I did my fucking boba duke spook and I'm like yeah I did a little play
00:17:19 field like look at me I'm so cool I'm the fucking evil guy that's gonna suck my dick and that was
00:17:24 cool so then I'm so then I made a third character and I'm like okay who will be my next wacky dark
00:17:29 souls character to enter the blue glow and change people's lives for the better so I decided to make
00:17:35 a tank character and I'm gonna make him I'm gonna make him like the most defensive uh yes like high
00:17:40 vitality impossible to knock down fucking tank guy big fat fucking fat armor I named him tank
00:17:47 mcspank he's the coolest character ever and I wanted to unleash him upon the world but then I started
00:17:53 playing and I started realizing there's no fucking poise in this game poise doesn't do a goddamn thing
00:17:58 in this game and then I started looking it up and I realized it's not I'm not making it up it's not in
00:18:02 my head it's true they fucking they totally nerfed poise so like would you just describe what that
00:18:09 means in case they don't know yeah okay so poise is the stat like in dark souls one if you if you
00:18:16 get hit your character gets knocked back it'll like interrupt your attacks and shit but if you have
00:18:20 like high enough poise then nothing can like stop you so if you're in the the middle of an attack
00:18:25 getting hit by a sword won't stop you you can like walk through enemies like hits and like
00:18:30 just brush it off and keep walking that's what the poise is for and uh dark souls three it has a poise
00:18:36 stat but the poise stat does nothing it to the point where like it has to be a mistake it has to be
00:18:43 like a glitch people are assuming but because now I've been told that the poise also wasn't a thing
00:18:50 in dark souls two I can't verify that because I don't remember making a strength build in that
00:18:56 game okay but it doesn't matter if it were people wouldn't just be complaining about it now well
00:19:02 that's the thing because I I brought this up to my brother shade who's like an expert on all the
00:19:05 games and he was like oh yeah poise wasn't a thing in dark souls two and I was like oh well I don't
00:19:11 know if Jesse knows that because I've only heard it from you but I don't really read souls communities
00:19:15 or yeah well like I never would have noticed it except until like for the first time I made like
00:19:19 a tank kind of character right well that's shit like it like it just it just seems like a mistake
00:19:26 because they have stuff like the wolf ring which increases poise yeah it literally does nothing
00:19:30 because the poise stat is worthless and people discovered it'll get patched yeah a lot of people
00:19:36 there's people who like discovered like they went into the code of it and they like change
00:19:41 something around and they were able to activate poise by going into the code of the game but
00:19:46 then they got like soft banned from from software as though like they don't want people to have
00:19:52 poise well those people probably played online with that poise that you know they were probably
00:19:58 because if if other people don't have it then it's unfair but it just seems like weird and fishy like
00:20:03 you'd think by now there'd be like a statement on it where they'd say either like yeah we took it
00:20:08 off because of these reasons or yeah we made a mistake and we'll fix it I mean I assume it's
00:20:12 the same in the Japanese version which has been out for what six months you know four or three
00:20:16 months something it's a while well that's shit I also complain about magic because I haven't actually
00:20:22 done this myself because I I don't play as a pussy ass magic user but I hear magic is just
00:20:26 totally totally garbage I you know I haven't I haven't done much pvp but I just heard that
00:20:36 it's totally unviable I'll put you into 69 of torment
00:20:44 yeah yeah I don't know oh by the way though I was just messing around for the first time
00:20:48 just a few minutes ago using the spell what was it uh what is it it's the one where you turn into
00:20:54 like the background fucking camouflage or whatever it is it is the most fun I've ever had in a video
00:21:00 game I just I follow behind an enemy I'm in Irithyll right behind the giant like sword dancer ladies
00:21:06 I follow like an inch behind them as a statue and then when they turn around I just stop moving
00:21:10 and they bump into me and move around and I do this for like 10 minutes it's the most fun I've
00:21:14 ever had in a video game they don't know what the fuck's going on it's great stupid ass hollows
00:21:20 that's what I'm saying it is a spell oh yeah well there's also like the item the the white the white
00:21:26 branches do that too oh really oh I didn't know that that's cool yeah um yeah man I I got it so to
00:21:33 talk about builds because my my experience with this game was kind of funny because like you know
00:21:39 I've got my my friend Donsan who played this into Japanese version and he breezed through it played
00:21:44 it three times but by the time the English version came out and uh he was saying that he thought it
00:21:49 was kind of easy and then me and my brother Shade played it and we both beat it in 18 hours of
00:21:54 peace and we both thought it was really easy compared to the other games and like I talked about this
00:21:59 on Twitter and then people were like what are you talking about this game is no easier than the
00:22:04 others it's just as hard and I was like look if I replayed Bloodborne I would have a harder time
00:22:10 than I did playing this game for the first time okay well first of all I'm not sure you should
00:22:14 compare it on a direct thing with Bloodborne because that is a different sort of game but I
00:22:18 think right we just played Dark Souls 1 not too long ago and I find it a very similar experience
00:22:23 the the pace is a little bit faster in this but I don't I don't know that seems like this
00:22:28 this felt like the the shortest and easiest of the games to me where I there's nothing that
00:22:34 there was nothing that gave I never died more than three times on the same thing until like the final
00:22:40 bosses like the the brothers and Osiris were like the only things that killed me more than three times
00:22:47 and uh and in each one was like five so it was just like but I don't know I don't know how much of
00:22:53 that was my build because once I was talking about it online everyone was telling me like
00:22:57 they had a much harder time with it or they took a lot longer than I did well did you did you get
00:23:01 all the secrets and stuff and I was like yeah I got there's like a venture I the 18 hours was
00:23:06 before I did all the secret levels once I did them all like I went back and did them it was like
00:23:10 closer to 21 hours but I still felt like I just kind of steamrolled most of the game you know and
00:23:16 then I figured out did you go into the the catacombs of the fucking underground lava place because
00:23:21 that was that once fucking nightmare that's gonna be like five hours to clear out well maybe not
00:23:26 that long but a while after I was already pretty strong I mean we just did it on digi bros and on
00:23:31 like a new game and we we like went there right in the catacombs we just went straight to that level
00:23:38 and Victor cleared it in the span of three episodes you know so I don't know I but then again the thing
00:23:44 is that all of us we later realized played our first run of the game with strength builds we
00:23:51 all played putting everything into vigor and strength and and like a little bit of endurance
00:23:57 and and like vitality I mean that's that's easy mode that's easy mode for sure right well that's
00:24:01 the thing like I don't know like to what extent that is like literally easy mode but you know we
00:24:07 all played like naked do all the roles and just have a giant sword and that's your like your method
00:24:13 you know like giant sword plus 10 kill everything in one hit run through you know and it definitely
00:24:19 felt easier that way and then once I did try to play like a different type of character that
00:24:23 wasn't all strength then I immediately was like a lot more frustrated like okay this is a lot harder
00:24:30 playing anything other than strength so I do think that maybe the build is like because I think in
00:24:36 every Dark Souls game every Souls game like you can there is built in like difficulty settings
00:24:42 you know like the way you play changes the difficulty of the game and I think that might
00:24:48 be more true in this game than it's ever been before where strength build really is like an easier
00:24:53 difficulty setting of the game than I mean but why would that be there's there's just the one answer
00:24:59 that like I mean the more the tougher you are like a big health bar what it translates to is
00:25:03 you're able to make more mistakes and that's pretty much it because like if you're a ranger it like I've
00:25:08 heard a lot of people have actually played like with a bow in this game that like using the short bow
00:25:12 is is totally a viable way to play and like you can just cheese almost every boss just by staying
00:25:18 far away and just backing up continuously and firing arrows so like I don't know there's uh
00:25:23 there's lots of ways to cheese things and buffing your health as far as it'll go rate making yourself
00:25:27 strong and then just giving yourself the ability to you know make mistakes I guess it's just that it's
00:25:32 so easy to do in this game because in the other games I always grind it at the start like in Dark
00:25:37 Souls uh or rather in uh in Bloodborne because that was the first one I played all the way through
00:25:41 I spent like five hours just grinding souls and and vials so that I would never run out of vials
00:25:47 like right at the start of the game before I made any progress and then like in all the other games
00:25:52 I would always have parts where I had to grind for souls or grind for tight tight night and
00:25:56 shit and then in this game like by the time because you start off with a boss fight like right at
00:26:01 the beginning and by the time you get to Firelink Shrine you can immediately level up five or six
00:26:06 times and then in the second level you find a guy who gives you five free level ups you know
00:26:12 and so but at a dark cost yeah but that dark cost doesn't have any really negative effects
00:26:18 oh it can't use your worst effect it makes you ugly that's yeah yeah yeah but it doesn't have
00:26:23 any like it's a lore effect mostly like in in in the previous games like like take Demon Souls
00:26:28 like if you were well me in this game you know you can ember yourself and it gives you a longer
00:26:34 life bar but like in Demon Souls the only way you could become human was to kill a boss you know
00:26:40 so you more likely spent the entire game as as a hollow with half a health bar you know well like
00:26:47 three quarters because you'll use the cling ring probably right but yeah you still are always going
00:26:52 to have a reduced health bar because it's such a huge risk to be human because if you die as a human
00:26:57 then your world tendency gets darker and the whole game gets harder yeah so like for me I would beat
00:27:01 a boss and then I would immediately kill myself in the nexus so that I wouldn't um you know darken
00:27:07 my world tendency uh because I didn't want the game to get that much harder so like I don't feel
00:27:12 like there's any real trade-off for hollowing in this game like you you gain five level ups and
00:27:17 there's really nothing to stop you all right I mean that is true the the effects of the hollowing
00:27:22 are are purely aesthetic and like ending relative that just fucks with like the the path you can
00:27:28 take but I don't know I the game's like trading the normal hollow it's doing it's it's doing a new
00:27:34 direction hollows are out embering is in lords of cinders are what the cool kids are doing now
00:27:39 and I think it's cool and I just did the uh the the dark ending the usur your usurpation of the fire
00:27:45 ending and I thought it was fucking tight some of the coolest shit happens along that line I have
00:27:49 not seen that ending yet you haven't seen oh dude it's the coolest I think was angry I've been I've
00:27:54 been saving it for baba duke spook because it seems like something he would do and I haven't
00:27:59 thought his storyline was over yeah well his let's play storyline is over but
00:28:03 me playing the game is never over dude you gotta gotta get him his betrothed you know that was just
00:28:09 the end of his seventh life who knows how many he has yeah I don't know he's like the doctor he
00:28:17 regenerates but he's always the same guy I want to shout out real quick um my favorite boss my
00:28:23 favorite thing in all the dark souls games thus far has been um maiden astrea that boss fight is
00:28:30 the coolest thing that ever happened and it really is the best thing in any of the things but uh
00:28:36 there's one in this game that comes close it's not as good but I love it dearly and it affected me
00:28:41 greatly in my in my playthrough so uh I played the entire my entire new game plus cosplaying as an
00:28:48 undead legion member and I was I was making the gesture at everyone I met I was fucking wearing the
00:28:54 armor the whole time I used uh the the the wolf greatsword the undead legion is the coolest thing
00:29:00 that's ever happened uh since maiden astrea and I'll tell you why it's because these motherfuckers
00:29:06 like the when I heard the fucking I forget who said um that that guy me at the beginning
00:29:12 who's like the uh the crestfallen warrior of this game is a is a uh what's the word uh
00:29:17 deserter of the undead legion he's wearing the armor and shit and he he tells you like it's a
00:29:23 it's a bunch of dudes they're all really strong they have this they've consumed wolf blood to allow
00:29:27 them to to to do these inhuman fighting techniques that a normal person can't do with these giant
00:29:32 greatswords and they don't use shields because those are for pussies and um they he in his own
00:29:37 words they will bury a fucking kingdom at the first sign of the abyss spreading into it is that
00:29:44 not the coolest thing these people have no tolerance for your fucking darkness and they
00:29:49 will do whatever it takes to crush it and then when you you go go into the boss fight and all
00:29:54 these motherfuckers are going absolutely berserk they're fucking murdering each other they just keep
00:29:58 picking themselves back up because they're undead they go kill each other and then they fall down
00:30:02 I don't know why they're doing that I I think they were like fucked up by uh Aldrich or something
00:30:06 but but it was the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life it was the best boss fight
00:30:11 since main Australia they are the cutest I love them I want to be one they're my best friends
00:30:16 undead legion for life I love them so much I definitely thought the moment when they started
00:30:20 fighting each other I was like holy fucking shit it was the most creative thing I've seen in forever
00:30:26 I was a little disappointed when I found out that that some of them are specifically on your side
00:30:31 like the ones that have red eyes are fighting with you and the other ones are fighting against
00:30:36 now hang on I I looked into that that is not true because I many a time fighting those guys
00:30:41 die antagonize them and every single one including the red eyes will gang up on you they uh the red
00:30:46 eyes are that's what I I had thought that they were just fighting each other but that they would
00:30:50 turn on you I mean uh my brother told me otherwise maybe it's a new game plus thing because I'll
00:30:55 tell you those red eyes attacked me many times so that's that is not that's cool because that's
00:31:00 what I wanted it to be was just that they were like they were fighting each other but just out of
00:31:05 fucking like those guys are just going crazy in there they're just going fucking berserk it's
00:31:08 the coolest thing ever god that's the best I don't know like uh and and the uh the nameless king
00:31:14 shout out shout out that guy as the most spectacular boss I haven't seen the nameless
00:31:19 king yet actually oh he's he's a toughy he's a toughy yeah because on my on my uh first game
00:31:25 is like I because I did the thing where in this game it lets you if you beat the game you can go
00:31:30 you can still keep playing so I went back and I wanted to bring that up because actually just
00:31:34 now just a few minutes ago I I got my ending and I did that and the first time I instantly
00:31:39 reset because I fucked up I didn't want to but I did so this time uh I want to talk about the
00:31:44 lore implications or if this is just non-diagetic gameplay or something because I did that I I did
00:31:50 the usurpation of the fire thing so I think you like steal it or something and I walked back just
00:31:54 to see what's going on and the uh the the kill of the first flame like the the sword the the
00:32:00 bonfire there like there's no fire there it's like gone out and so I go back to fire link uh and I
00:32:05 see that Ludlith is dead he was alive before now he's dead and nothing else has changed so it's
00:32:13 making me wonder if this is like canon or or what happens if you do a different ending Ludlith is
00:32:18 Ludlith is always dead if you go back after okay so just because he died when when they activated
00:32:25 did you do a new you know continue after you uh if with a different ending you know what I'm
00:32:30 saying did you guys do that I haven't done a second I have not done a second continuation after
00:32:34 I don't know what the fuck I like it feels if I don't I I want to I want to bring this up because
00:32:39 this feels like something that is actually like wrong like this shouldn't be happening but they're
00:32:43 doing it just to let you play around in the world and like I like that I always liked how harsh that
00:32:48 the other games were like if you go fight the final boss you better be ready for new game plus
00:32:52 like it was well that's a thing though I said there was never there was never a warning for it
00:32:57 yeah and I think that like I I understand like doing it that way because you know thematically it
00:33:03 makes sense it's a brutal game you know but like I do think that there was something to be said for
00:33:09 like like for instance I I still haven't played the DLC in Dark Souls one because I straight up forgot
00:33:15 like I went to the final boss beat him and then remembered like during the final cut scene that
00:33:20 I had not done the DLC and I was like fuck I completely fucked up and there's no way I could
00:33:25 just like you know I'd have to play through the whole fucking game because you have to get all
00:33:28 the way to Duke's archives to even get into the DLC you know um and then Bloodborne kind of does
00:33:33 the same thing if you if you beat the final boss then you got to play all the way back through so
00:33:37 like for instance when uh Game Grumps were were doing the DLC like they came back to the game
00:33:42 they had to play all the way up to that point in new game plus just to be able to to do it on the
00:33:46 show it's like I I like that I can just have one character who I can just leave there if I want to
00:33:54 you know like that I can go back and do everything possible before I go to new game plus and have
00:33:58 all the items I want and be like completely prepared and you know have done everything and
00:34:03 and if I wanted to have like let's say you just wanted to have a character who you leave in that
00:34:08 state like so that you can just dick around in the end game you know like just have a guy who's
00:34:14 always perpetually at the end of the game no no don't like it I don't want it don't want it
00:34:18 because what that they're just they're catering it to uh to to the casual audience and I don't
00:34:23 like it I think you should have to play I don't think that caters the casual audiences
00:34:27 they're sacrificing narrative coherence for for you know convenience and I don't think that's
00:34:32 the trade-off I want well I don't think I have to suspend my disbelief at all to understand that I am
00:34:38 already done with the game and this is like a standard feature in most video games but Dark Souls
00:34:43 isn't a standard game it's better than a standard game and it should be held to that standard
00:34:47 like I said this earlier that I think that the goal of this game and I think this is true of a
00:34:52 lot of things in this game that I think the goal of it is to be playable long term in a way that
00:34:56 the other games aren't as much where I really think that with the other souls games they put a
00:35:01 lot of value on the first experience and a lot of value on like you know the learning experience
00:35:06 you'd have with it and like that like that's why there's so many traps and things like that but
00:35:11 none of that stuff matters as much on your second and third and fifth and eighth playthrough
00:35:15 because once you know it you can just easily avoid all the traps okay but here's the thing here's the
00:35:20 thing if you just if you just look into it ahead of time you'll know that fighting the final boss
00:35:25 triggers the end so you shouldn't be looking into it ahead of time if you're on but you should just
00:35:30 play the game experience what happens and then you'll know it's a game that's meant to be played
00:35:34 multiple times I think it's a reasonable trade-off I rather it's not one you shouldn't do that you
00:35:40 should make it I think I would much like I don't know that I would have gone well okay like because
00:35:45 I am so into this game I would have done it but like it would have been so much more disheartening
00:35:51 to find out about the Nameless King after I had already reset my game and I probably wouldn't have
00:35:56 run back and done it immediately but you see the thing you're protesting against is the very thing
00:36:00 that makes the game unique it's unwillingness but I don't bend before the whims of the masses
00:36:05 who want convenience overall with the other games and we don't need it again that's that's
00:36:10 that's stupid this game isn't just those games but why why does every why does every single one
00:36:16 have to be equally a pain in the ass why do they have to be equally narratively coherent because
00:36:20 they're stories because they're fucking art I don't want them to just I don't I don't I think
00:36:25 the trade-off is worth it I don't think okay I mean what you're talking about is a trade-off
00:36:29 and if you think it's worth it then fair but I don't I don't there are some who would argue that
00:36:34 Dark Souls has never been narratively coherent how do you love them apples okay let me tell you
00:36:40 right now why is it that when you kill an enemy you get their soul and when you die to them
00:36:45 why don't they get your soul in its game over forever why is that does anyone know who gives a
00:36:50 fuck that's a real question I'm just I'm helping your point god damn it but you're a I don't know
00:36:56 you're uh because you're a special guy you're not special though you're not special at all
00:37:00 everyone else who dies you get their soul instantly like when you kill the crestfallen warrior
00:37:03 you get his soul how come he doesn't get your soul when he kills you but how do you know he doesn't
00:37:07 get your soul that's what I mean start playing immediately never been narratively coherent
00:37:11 because if they're all in dead they should all be coming back like you but instead you get their
00:37:15 souls for some reason that's always been a concession for gameplay sake that doesn't make sense
00:37:20 in terms of the story so it's not like there's no well if that that thing seems so glaring to me
00:37:25 that I think that there's something I'm missing and there's a reason why I just don't understand
00:37:29 why that's happening you can't just say it's so perfect that if it doesn't make sense the problem
00:37:34 must be with me I'm not I'm not saying that it must be with me I'm saying I'm suspicious that it is
00:37:39 with me but I agree it makes me uh yeah okay it's not perfect it's not perfect I still don't
00:37:44 completely understand the complaint and I have no idea dude just just think about it when you
00:37:48 kill the crestfallen you're saying that yeah being able to play after you beat it you're talking about
00:37:52 npc god damn it there's only three of us you shouldn't be interrupting me I won't stand for
00:37:57 this go on go on I was just having the realization of what you were saying I wasn't cutting you off I
00:38:02 was just saying oh you mean npcs not enemies I thought you meant enemies yeah I'm gonna I mean
00:38:08 like when you just if you just attack the crestfallen warrior before he goes hollow
00:38:12 when he dies you get his souls and he doesn't come back why is that he isn't undead he should
00:38:17 be coming back right because he's gone full hollow well that's what I mean is that you just attack
00:38:21 him okay I've always been a precedent for these narrative concessions in for the gameplay
00:38:27 now wait I want to be super clear did you that that is not correct he was not fully hollow
00:38:31 he was just some dude hanging out well like when you attack him right there or forget him
00:38:36 they're like law trek or any other npc you meet like the blacksmith he's got a purpose when you
00:38:40 kill him he doesn't come back you know I just kind of always thought the implication was that everyone's
00:38:47 kind of at the end of their rope in the souls games because if you don't kill them they will
00:38:51 eventually die of their own accord and if you do kill them it's like you fucking ended it but
00:38:57 it's also possible that because time is convoluted in Lordran that that you're really just ending
00:39:04 I've always hated that fucking excuse that you can you can literally throw that at any problem in
00:39:09 the game and it'll just go away yeah well that's probably why they wrote it in there it's a really
00:39:14 convenient it probably is it was the only way to make sense of the idea that warriors are constantly
00:39:19 showing up in in your game and and disappearing you know okay but like Logan right Logan's on
00:39:24 a quest you meet Logan and then you kill him why doesn't he come back why is he's an undead
00:39:31 why did that happen he's got a purpose doesn't make sense doesn't make sense I guess you could
00:39:35 call it a narrative concession well let's think about the we've acknowledged that this is the worst
00:39:39 game ever okay go on let's talk about the real problem with this game is yeah um it's been out
00:39:44 for like a month now where the fuck are all my lore videos what are those guys doing they're
00:39:48 coming a little bit they're coming I want to understand what I've seen I want to understand it
00:39:54 I think I've got a pretty good idea of what's happened in the game uh there's this guy the
00:39:59 pontiff he found Aldrich Aldrich was an asshole who liked to eat people he he made him into a god
00:40:06 he built a church around that guy something something lords of cinder something something
00:40:12 guys in the castle princes they were gay or something for each other it caused all kinds of
00:40:17 problems for people they had to they had to get the fuck out of there and that caused the end of
00:40:21 the world so I gotta I gotta ask you guys about something that I think a lot of people have had
00:40:26 as like they're possibly biggest complaint with this game okay that uh that I don't think I consider
00:40:32 a complaint personally but I'm curious about your thoughts is the like the sheer amount of stuff
00:40:39 that's taken from the first game ah that's um okay I mean I can see why you might think that
00:40:45 that could be a problem and honestly sometimes you know maybe maybe a little bit thick maybe laid
00:40:49 on a little bit thick but overall I do not hate the idea that this is like it's like a grand return
00:40:55 you know it feels earned the things that were like the visit to anor Londo it's like it's not like
00:40:59 anyone who says like oh they just copy paste at anor Londo that is so fucking lazy like no there
00:41:04 was there was serious craft put into this like reimagining of anor Londo and it's great and like
00:41:10 like when you when you see the giant blacksmith and you bring and you see him dead and you grab
00:41:14 his soul and you bring it to Andre and Andre is like oh I'm so sad that guy that was my brother
00:41:19 that was the most feels moment in the whole fucking game dude that was intense feels it was great it was
00:41:24 great because like you played you know they've got to respect for each other man it's that yeah see
00:41:30 that's the kind of like there's there's love in this shit it's not it's not lazy at all so you
00:41:34 know I'm uh sometimes a little thick overall definitely in favor of it I think it works
00:41:40 wait what's going on I spaced out for like 20 god damn it Jesse how do you feel about the
00:41:44 how do you feel about the references to Dark Souls one in this game I love it needs to be more of
00:41:49 them there I love everything I love fan service I want it in my face all the time yeah so like you
00:41:57 know I was rewatching um Matthew Matosis's video on Dark Souls two from way back because uh I don't
00:42:03 think he hates that game enough he doesn't hate it as much as I do the pure the pure unadulterated
00:42:08 hatred that I have but uh you know he he complained a little bit about the references to Dark Souls
00:42:13 one in that game and I thought it was interesting because I think that the reason that the references
00:42:17 to Dark Souls one can be annoying in that game is because they feel like they're there just to
00:42:23 make references to Dark Souls one even though the story of Dark Souls two feels like it could have
00:42:27 been a totally unrelated yeah the issue is that they tell you it has been so long and everything
00:42:33 has been forgotten from an age oh by the way would you like to join the Sunbroke covenant
00:42:37 like it's like come on guys come on and the Lords of Cinder or the or the souls of the four bosses
00:42:42 of the first game or in the bosses of the second game or something like that yeah it doesn't it
00:42:46 just doesn't seem like there was a reason to do that that's right with Dark Souls three this game
00:42:51 like everything about the story is a sequel to Dark Souls one like it's everything is relevant
00:42:57 because the whole point of it is that it's like a bunch of twins like you're fighting like it's
00:43:03 basically just raising the stakes to the next level in the first game you had to fight all these
00:43:08 bosses just to get to one Lord of Cinder now you got to fight fucking five of them you know like
00:43:13 and and you're no longer just in undead so from Vadi's latest video he kind of implied that like
00:43:21 something that Miyazaki said implied that you the the ashen warriors that you are in this game
00:43:29 are like basically comprised of ashes of people who failed to link the fire in before like so
00:43:37 basically rather than being a chosen undead you're like the remnants of chosen undead who
00:43:42 failed well if you if you think about it literally everyone who is an undead who did not link the
00:43:48 flame which is most people would fall under that description so that is accurate right I just to me
00:43:55 I always had the impression that that you're you like everything in this game is more powerful
00:44:00 than Dark Souls one you're not just an undead you're this next level type of undead this like
00:44:05 right this one who who who can ember himself and become even more powerful like you said uh yeah
00:44:12 like you're dealing with you know many Lords of Cinder instead of one and I feel that the you know
00:44:16 your power is sort of reflective of that you're an elevated individual and I had this because
00:44:23 if you've seen my video about like the it is confusing though it is confusing that is true
00:44:27 it's definitely confusing and like when the game was first coming out I thought for sure the main
00:44:31 character was going to be someone who had linked the fire before like you also were a Lord of
00:44:35 Cinder because it would call back to the fact that you've probably beaten the first game you know
00:44:40 but um but you know I think that in each game the the idea of your character kind of matches the
00:44:46 mechanics and Bloodborne you're a hunter and therefore you're very aggressive and you're
00:44:50 rewarded for attacking enemies head on and you're you're meant to feel more powerful whereas in
00:44:55 Dark Souls one you're more clunky and slow because you're just another fuck off undead like everybody
00:45:00 else yeah and in this game you feel a little faster you feel a little stronger because you're
00:45:05 not just any undead you're in you're this new thing the unkindled you're like a different
00:45:10 type of guy and you're you're a little stronger and better and the kind of person who could take
00:45:15 down five fucking Lords of Cinder you know I guess I mean you fight fucking giant scaleless
00:45:21 seeth the god of dragons in the last and I mean you do okay and you're just some undead
00:45:25 I don't know I guess I see your point though yeah it's well I mean I'm not saying that you're
00:45:29 you're like super weak like the point is that you rise up above all the other undead but like the
00:45:33 mechanics of that game are that you have like when you start off you're pretty normal and weak
00:45:40 you don't really have like the speed and prowess that you have in Bloodborne where you can fucking
00:45:45 sidestep and juke and shit like you're you know you're doing fat heavy rolls and falling all over
00:45:50 yourself unless you're naked so and like in this game it's more like the armor is more like Bloodborne
00:45:56 people call it fashion souls where yep the you know the stats of the armor don't really matter all
00:46:01 that matter is that you wear it yeah that's right yeah um I don't know I think it's somewhere in that
00:46:06 middle middle ground I think that's communicated well in who you are and just the idea that you
00:46:11 have to go kill five people who are all on the level of Gwyn is really cool to me you know though
00:46:17 I mean just just to play devil's advocate wasn't Gwyn like kind of fucked up and like not at full
00:46:24 power because he had linked the fire so isn't he like weaker than he should have been I mean you
00:46:28 know I mean technically all these guys would be I guess because they've all linked the fire but
00:46:33 yeah I don't know I mean I don't know the guy the crestfallen warrior guy implies that you're not
00:46:38 fit to lick the boots of these people they are as gods they are the best guys yeah but I always
00:46:43 kind of thought that was because like I mean when you play through the games the way that you get
00:46:47 stronger is like they perform a ritual on you using souls that you collect and that like just feeds
00:46:53 into you and like your power level rises basically and you know that's that's what I always got out
00:46:59 of it that is like your job is to go out there collect souls use them to get strong and that's
00:47:04 like when you are at the end like if if somebody killed you and like stuck took your soul at the
00:47:07 end it would be worth like a billion souls because like you fucking right you know yeah that's an
00:47:13 interesting thought um video games I like them yeah they're pretty cool but yeah yeah I like all
00:47:21 the references to dark souls one I like how the references to dark souls two are kind of subtle
00:47:26 and hidden there's that giant tree outside which I like yeah there's there's that there's like the
00:47:31 the old lady who sells you stuff might be a reference to the old ladies from dark souls two
00:47:36 yeah but I love that I love that the way that that and I'll talk about this in a video if I finally
00:47:41 fucking do it but at the end of that hallway you see Andre and like immediately if you're if you've
00:47:46 played dark souls one you're like oh my fucking god it's Andre and it's literally him it's him yeah
00:47:51 and then the dark souls two ladies kind of tucked off to the side where you can't see her at first
00:47:56 and I I really think that's intentional I really think you feel that in the game you feel a little
00:48:01 bit of like the okay we can't like get rid of it completely but let's let's focus on the money
00:48:05 maker here you'll find like you'll find characters from dark souls two like you'll find some of their
00:48:09 armor sets and some of their bodies laying around you guys are so goddamn stupid like there's this
00:48:15 like like dark souls two was such a great shame that there's a conspiracy to erase it in dark
00:48:20 well I didn't say that they put your own ass on this you can think about it like this Jesse
00:48:24 me jacking yourselves off for your stupid illogical Jesse I never said anything like that I never
00:48:30 said for it just I never said they were trying to hide it I just said that it's not prominent
00:48:35 but it's all well of course the the nostalgia for the first game is going to be more prominent
00:48:39 it's the first fucking game and I can consider this though I'm being supposedly terrible and
00:48:44 unworthy dark souls two is look dark souls two is the worst game ever made and I'd rather kill
00:48:48 fucking idiot and I'd rather kill you I will shut my penis off and stab myself through my ear
00:48:54 into my brain and die just so I don't have to play dark souls you can you can think about it Jesse
00:48:59 as Miyazaki just didn't direct dark souls two so he's only interested in continuing his word
00:49:05 Ray is too good in the force why was Iron Man so mean when I feel like it's all the same
00:49:11 complaint it's all the same stupid shit Jesse you're you're you're like Aldrich eater of complaints
00:49:17 and you eat all the wines that people make and you use them to fuel you yeah dark souls two is a
00:49:22 terrible game you're an idiot liking it is the problem making the world worse Jesse you're
00:49:28 actually ruining all right all right without being an idiot why it's terrible I dare you
00:49:36 mind the controls suck the animation the level is every dark you're what the fuck I can't even
00:49:43 keep up with how much wrong you're spewing at me right now feel a little bit floaty uh they don't
00:49:47 feel as as as okay okay none of the animation is fucking garbage you're just saying stuff that's
00:49:52 fucking wrong you realize that you have to realize that you're just saying shit that isn't even true
00:49:56 how are you Jesse I can prove it onto you and I will once I start putting out those yeah once
00:50:02 I see you die a hundred times on the first level and blame the game for it like Aaron
00:50:05 fucking Hanson I'm sure you'll prove it to me how bad it is yeah I don't I don't hate it for the
00:50:11 fact that I die all the time I hate it because every mechanic is bad and the game they're the exact
00:50:16 fucking same as every other game in the series they're not they're nothing like that I don't
00:50:21 I don't really see where you're getting that uh there's like some some tuning differences that's
00:50:26 for sure I don't know whatever it's entirely different nothing is the same all of it does
00:50:30 nothing makes sense it's all retarded they changed everything for the worst and it's a broken shitty
00:50:35 game you're just saying these like grand like statements that don't have any specifics in them
00:50:39 you're just making you want me to spend this entire podcast talking about dark souls
00:50:44 dark souls are so much better than in dark souls one I enjoyed the controls are better let's see that
00:50:49 was fun dual wielding is how can you the fucking jumping is so much better jumping is such bullshit
00:50:55 in dark souls you jump like a you jump like one inch in dark souls by the way I want to drink
00:50:59 it possible this is people need to hear about this because in dark souls three is a big fucking
00:51:04 problem because the way you jump is you click the left stick and when you're ready improvement that
00:51:09 no it's not a problem it's an improvement it is a problem because when I'm using the left stick
00:51:14 to click I have to move it and I fucking move up my fucking movement every time I'm doing it fun fact
00:51:19 what fun fact I learned from victor in both the ps3 and pc versions you can change that very easily
00:51:24 in the menu I I know but I don't want to use a I tried it with a couple other buttons it wasn't
00:51:29 working out fucking I said it not on the first I'm baffled that you can prefer the circle jumping
00:51:35 over the clicking jump in I like the circle jumping is better it's true the first time it's
00:51:39 horrible it's impossible fucking roll by accident it's so easy to do it's no you just do it right
00:51:45 and you don't have a problem first time I tried when I started up dark souls three and I was trying
00:51:49 to get that first item that you have to jump for in the very tutorial level yeah I had to I took
00:51:55 10 tries on that I was gonna say it took me about because of the fucking stick jump and then as soon
00:51:59 as I changed it to circle jump I made it on the first try it was the easiest thing in the world
00:52:04 well like there you go all you got to do is be dashing and then hit the circle button yeah it's
00:52:08 totally fucked up and you fucking roll half the time it's never happened all right all right what
00:52:13 is blowing you guys's mind about just fucking clicking the thumbstick it's like that's my because
00:52:17 it changes the direction that you're moving the direction doesn't it's way easier and way more
00:52:22 accurate it's fucking every time I tried to make that jump because you have to break slightly to
00:52:26 the left to make that jump right and every single time when I clicked the stick my guy would change
00:52:31 direction a little and I just missed it's a very precise jump you're trying to make and even that
00:52:35 little bit of fucking up guys just suck at video games because you're totally wrong on this one
00:52:40 the clicking the thumbstick is a massive improvement that dark souls two made over dark souls one
00:52:44 and you don't want to admit it because you're just clinging to anything you can find to make dark
00:52:49 souls two a good game dark souls two is a fucking great game all right there's only there's look
00:52:54 there's a few changes from dark souls two that I think were great ideas that they did keep in dark
00:52:58 souls three uh fast climbing up ladders oh yeah that's a good one and fast falling down ladders
00:53:03 which is much better in this game because in dark souls two you could fucking hurt yourself from
00:53:07 fast falling which is law retarded um looking about if you fast fall down a ladder like two
00:53:14 two distance I don't fucking believe that at all I don't believe you I don't believe you I've never
00:53:19 seen that shit I've seen it before if you fall if you fast fall down a long enough ladder it
00:53:24 hurts you here we've got we've got jesse defending every little point and did you just make and
00:53:28 shit up to shit on no it's this this is fucking go look it up man like this is something I'm
00:53:35 complaining about day one that I don't fucking fall off ladders and shit like that's like a dark
00:53:39 souls bags of sand comment what does that mean it's fucking true though what does that fucking
00:53:44 hurt yourself by falling down ladders you're saying dumb shit fucking the okay fucking
00:53:49 lucatile is the best NPC ever lucatile is boring and I don't give a shit about her come on dude
00:53:55 she's come on I tried so hard to care about her like I cared about solar I tried and I got very
00:54:01 far but in the end it didn't fucking matter because she's boring and I don't she's she's
00:54:06 every NPC in dark enough about fucking dark souls two for no all right all right I will never have
00:54:11 enough of dark souls before I want to talk about NPCs cool sky of all time fucking oh yeah he was
00:54:17 cool vendric was cool I like vendric the fucking emerald herald is the hottest girl in all the games
00:54:22 no I mean she's boring as fuck dude I mean she's pretty hot okay what is her deal is she a dragon
00:54:28 or not what is what's even going on with that no one knows she's a fucking I know she's but she
00:54:33 she's fucking she's rey she's reyanami she is to the dragon all she does is stand there and say
00:54:38 exposition that's all she does oh yeah the other ones are so much fucking different right dude dude
00:54:43 the the fucking the the dog made in the fire the firekeeper in dark souls three will fucking laugh
00:54:49 when you make gestures at her she'll curtsy for you she'll bow with you she'll dance with you
00:54:53 she's my fucking wife she's also ugly ass albino with a so good you're ugly you have no fucking
00:55:00 sense I'm not I'm not gonna defend the firekeeper from three I'm not the biggest fan of her I just
00:55:06 thought she was fucking she kind of reminded me of the emerald herald she kind of just stands there
00:55:10 and like she's fucking real she's as good as the goddamn doll she's like your best friend in the
00:55:14 world yeah so nice oh you fucking be anyway okay I was herald is a fucking sexy ass Irish lass
00:55:22 fucking red hair a green ass god I want to just I want to marry him somehow I knew that this all
00:55:27 all this came down to just that she's a redhead you know she's just a rehash of the maiden black
00:55:31 she fucking she's the maiden black too they just tried to make her again only they put a green
00:55:35 cloak on her and I like the green cloak I actually I do I like the maiden green overall
00:55:39 but she's confused with the lore I don't even know what the fuck she is anyway enough about
00:55:43 Dark Souls 2 forget about I want to talk about Dark Souls 3 and the final boss because we were
00:55:47 talking about bosses before Dark Souls 3 sucks I disowned Dark Souls 3 I'm all about Dark Souls
00:55:51 2 now listen to me talk about Dark Souls 3 all right so the great that we were talking before
00:55:56 about references to Dark Souls 1 and all Dark Souls and that's why he's such a great boss I can wear
00:56:01 that fucking smelter demon armor and look like a member of Guar you can't do that shit and
00:56:06 demon sucks ass all right armor does not suck ass the armor is the most fucking armor in the
00:56:10 entire series I got my fucking you're literally showing off your fucking stomach because you
00:56:14 want to get fucked by all the boys in town all right let's move on I do I want to say no I do I
00:56:18 want King Vendor to come a fucking river in my abs that's what I want I want it all night
00:56:24 all right okay all right let's settle down because the what is he called the the Lord of
00:56:29 Cinder after it what's his name it's like the the the the soul of of cinder right that's it yes
00:56:34 okay the soul of cinder is the coolest final boss and the best final boss in any of the soul born
00:56:40 games in my humble opinion and that's cool for several reasons you should that's a fucking laugh
00:56:47 all right shut up jessie shut the fuck up you're not allowed to talk about dark souls 2 anymore
00:56:54 all right I don't even know how many of these opinions jessie has
00:56:58 is being just great nishonor there's no way he really thinks nishonor is better than the fucking
00:57:03 I'm getting me I'm getting fucking me yes all right it's just a prank bro
00:57:10 all right the soul of cinder is he's a two phase boss and the first phase
00:57:15 all right I'll just tell you what he is he's he is every person who's ever linked the fire before
00:57:21 as an amalgam so what that translates to and you see this in his moveset is he is every player
00:57:26 character up to this point of the game and he's Gwyn on top of it and when that when you get to
00:57:31 halfway through the fight and the Gwyn's the motif of Gwyn's theme comes in on top of the theme
00:57:37 that's already playing and he fucking lights a sword on fire and starts doing Gwyn moves
00:57:41 it's just it's the perfect it's the perfect fucking thing it's okay it's the it's the coolest thing
00:57:47 that I've ever seen or you've ever seen I know that for a fucking fact because you're
00:57:51 jessie bought a fucking figurine of this boss by the way you do where's your nishonor bobblehead
00:57:56 I don't fucking see one on your show they don't make one because the world is full of idiots like
00:58:00 you who don't appreciate Dark Souls 2 and all of its majesty and artistry that's why they don't
00:58:04 make one I'd buy a hundred nishondras I'd buy 50 000 nishondra toys if they made them but they
00:58:09 don't because they're all dummies and fuckboys all right anyway he's he's a great final boss he's
00:58:14 one of these like uh it's like fighting one of you sort of only he's like super player it's like
00:58:20 a rival fight sort of yeah that's right and those are always the best way to end uh a big fucking
00:58:25 because like they challenge the mechanics they they use the mechanics you've been fucking learning
00:58:28 to deal with he's the best it's awesome okay I definitely felt that like in terms of because
00:58:34 the first time I went to that boss fight like because I didn't quite comprehend what I was seeing
00:58:39 at first oh yeah so I went in there and I was just like oh it looks beautiful the red flowers and
00:58:42 shit oh it's the right well the the arena is awesome but my first thought was just kind of like who
00:58:46 the fuck is this guy right because like I would say up until this point Garmin has been the best
00:58:51 boss in the Soulsborne games because he's someone who you you knew who he was bloodborne sucks it's
00:58:57 a fucking three out of ten okay but Garmin Garmin was someone you saw through the whole game yeah
00:59:03 he's always in like a wheelchair he's just this old guy you know and then you get to the final battle
00:59:08 and he fucking gets up and he's the strongest fucking guy ever you know it's awesome and it's like
00:59:14 you know there's been hunter battles throughout the whole game but he's like the ultimate hardest
00:59:18 most fucking like destroys you and his arena is amazing like it's the coolest fucking arena ever
00:59:24 I definitely think it's the best arena yeah even then I yeah it's a it's a tough competition
00:59:29 because the imagery of the fucking house burning in the background is so fucking cool I mean it's
00:59:33 just the flowers man you can't beat and like they try to put the flowers for Soul Cinder and I mean
00:59:38 it's nice it's nice but yeah that's why when I first went into Soul Cinder I was like all right
00:59:42 this arena looks just like Garmin's arena yeah and I don't know who the fuck this guy is because
00:59:46 it's not an established character like it was in that but then once I did realize that oh my god
00:59:52 he's every player character he's everyone who's leaked the fire then I was like oh this fucking
00:59:57 red like Garmin is a guy that you've gotten to know over the course of Bloodborne but this guy
01:00:02 shut up Jesse I'm saying a fucking profound point broke the cycle with this magical crown which is
01:00:08 the best guy I was thinking about what I was gonna say and I'm gonna fucking say it shut up
01:00:12 but Dark Souls 2 guy was a chick wasn't it wasn't N'Shawn? yeah she's the queen whatever all right I
01:00:17 was going to say that Dark Souls 2 guy wasn't N'Shawn I'm talking about the player character
01:00:21 if you do the DLC you get the magic crowns you break the cycle you don't have to link the fire
01:00:25 I'm gonna fucking kill you Jesse shut the fuck up I'm trying to say something okay all right
01:00:31 because my big old dick my big old butt Garmin's someone that you got to know
01:00:40 listen buddy you got to know Jesse I'm gonna fucking kill you
01:00:45 Garmin's someone you get to know over the course of Bloodborne but the Soul of Cinder
01:00:50 it's the player that you've gotten to know over the course of the entire series since Demon Souls
01:00:55 and for that reason once you make that connection it is it is it is a transcendent moment it's the
01:01:00 best fucking thing it's the coolest and that's what I was trying to say I gotta say that great point
01:01:07 yeah it was a great point I love that there's references to Demon Souls in this as well
01:01:13 although I will say that the biggest one I'm kind of torn about because the biggest Demon
01:01:17 Souls reference is that you get the storm ruler to fight the giant oh man that was the coolest
01:01:22 thing okay but go I want to yeah go on well I'll say that there's a way to make that the coolest
01:01:27 fight in the game yeah there is yeah there is do the whole if you do the whole uh Zygward Zygward
01:01:32 is by far the best character in this game he is my bro I love him intensely god he's the coolest
01:01:39 guy ever but go on Jesse do you know about the ending of the Zygward uh uh run like a storyline
01:01:44 no you oh my god it's the best fucking thing ever he he will fight yorm the giant with you
01:01:50 because he has the other storm ruler because him and dude let me set the stage for this a little
01:01:54 bit all right because let me let me just back up a little bit because I beat the game for the first
01:01:58 time and when you go into the arena cool internet guys fighting yorm for me okay well that that's
01:02:03 cool but this is also a cool thing about it well I when I beat that when I fought yorm for the first
01:02:07 time on his on his throne he's got a uh what's it called the the storm king the fucking storm
01:02:13 ruler the storm ruler sword yeah and you pick it up and you figure out to use it and you fight him
01:02:17 with it and it makes him pretty easy which is a little unfortunate but it's still a really fun
01:02:21 fight uh but in the description of that item it says like yorm uh kept one of these weapons with him
01:02:28 and gave one to a trusted companion eons ago before he linked the flame or whatever and then
01:02:33 like as I'm playing through the second time and I'm getting every NPC storyline uh Zygmire uh like
01:02:39 you just right zygward I've always fucked that up zygward is just like you just do his
01:02:44 shit and he's talking about like a friend he made a promise to and then you know you go along
01:02:48 you help him with the stuff and then you finally see at the end when you get to yorm's fucking
01:02:51 cutscene if you've done everything with zygward and you walk it he walks in holding the storm ruler
01:02:56 so all these he made a promise to his brother to fucking murder his ass if he ever turned
01:03:01 traitor on everybody so he's here to fulfill like this sad promise with his best friend from a million
01:03:06 fucking years ago using this legendary sword and it's like the coolest thing that ever happened
01:03:10 and I don't know if you guys know what happens to him afterward but I'm pretty sure he immediately
01:03:14 like dies slash goes hollow afterward because he's fulfilled his purpose it's the saddest most and
01:03:18 because all along zygward was the best bro he gives you fucking booze he gives you booze and
01:03:25 he toasts with it and you just hang out and he fucking will take naps just for fun in the middle
01:03:29 of wherever oh my god I love zygward so much he's the coolest guy in the world I definitely think
01:03:33 that that's like if you do all that then that boss fight is fucking awesome it's insane but for me
01:03:38 it was just like I went in there and I tried to fight him like twice without noticing the thing on his
01:03:45 throat oh really he takes a million billion like he takes no damage yeah I'm a strength guy I have
01:03:51 like I'm barely chipping away at his health and at first I thought it's kind of cool because I could
01:03:55 like this is just a big epic protracted struggle that you're like fighting this guy forever and it's
01:04:00 such a you know such a huge hassle but then he also can kill you in like two hits so it's
01:04:04 like yeah well I'd have to be able to survive fucking 15 minutes of fighting to do this and
01:04:09 then I noticed the item and I pick it up and I'm like oh my fucking god it's the storm ruler right
01:04:13 coolest fucking boss fight when you have zygward walk in there and he fucking says like my old friend
01:04:20 I've come to fulfill my promise to you have at thee it was it was the best part of the whole game
01:04:26 by far by far without that it's a little disappointing when you go in with the storm
01:04:30 ruler and you just destroy it takes five flights to kill him five yeah and he will not hit you
01:04:36 because he staggers so hard after you use it that you could just like fucking you just click the button
01:04:41 a few times and he's dead yeah yeah it went from like the most epic protracted struggle in the game
01:04:47 to the easiest fuckboy ever I wish they had made him a little bit harder that's just an
01:04:53 issue of like tweaking if you take like some kind of defense measure against you when you've got
01:04:57 that sword like you he can't do shit to you it's like yeah embarrassing and it just sucks because
01:05:03 the storm ruler in because like my defense of all the the references to dark souls one is that I
01:05:10 think that they are equally cool in this game like if you played this game not knowing if you
01:05:15 played this game not knowing anything about dark souls one then like sigmar sigward coming up the
01:05:19 elevator would still be like whoa an npc was on that elevator you know that's awesome and and and
01:05:24 then he goes into battle with you like whoa he went into battle with me and like all and going to
01:05:28 anor lando would still be like whoa this thing was up here you know this epic looking castle but I
01:05:34 think with that particular one then the storm ruler and demon souls was like the the whole idea
01:05:40 of it was you were fighting this giant fucking manor ray in the sky and it was insanity and then
01:05:45 in this game it's like a piss easy boss fight and so I just thought that that was the one
01:05:50 reference that didn't live up to what the original was you know I wouldn't be that harsh but I do
01:05:57 think it could have been improved with some some hb tweaking or something but then if you have
01:06:02 zygmire with you then it's fucking cool zygmire zygmire yeah oh i love fucking zygmire so much
01:06:07 he's my favorite i love him the undead legion zygward and uh darkmoon captain yorshka are my
01:06:16 best but that's my wife my best friend and my my bro team that's me playing dark souls jesse do you
01:06:23 have some more uh stuff you love about this game you want to talk about since how about those oh no
01:06:27 he hates this game how about those dark areas and dark souls too you had to use the torch and
01:06:31 fucking you had to light your way those oh yeah oh yeah i love this is the one useful mechanic
01:06:36 jesse this is the one dark souls three podcast we're gonna do are you sure you want to spend the whole
01:06:41 time leaving about dark souls too like jesse do we know you love this game to talk about all the
01:06:47 things you love about this game and how cool it ain't no other pony troll it down like jesse jesse
01:06:53 jesse tell tell me about tell me about the purple phantoms jesse tell me about the purple
01:06:57 phantoms oh yeah the mad phantoms yeah those are pretty cool yeah why are they cool jesse
01:07:02 why are they cool i guess if you actually want to hear jesse talk about this game you'll just
01:07:05 have to go watch the blue glow um i'm just clearly not interested in discussing it here
01:07:12 he'll he'll come around no wait let's talk about the fucking all the cool bosses in dark souls three
01:07:19 they're so okay yeah fucking okay never mind uh who's who's a cool boss i like dancer is the
01:07:26 hottest babe of all time i want to look at her but i want to touch her butt i want to get up in that
01:07:32 butt the dancer has by far the best but in all of dark souls in all of the series without a doubt
01:07:37 it's interfacing the entire time it's amazing i can't even like i don't know who would i consider
01:07:42 the they're all fucking rad there's so many good bosses well the two brothers were super awesome
01:07:47 that was a great fight yeah uh the fucking the two gay boys yeah they're awesome i i i think that
01:07:51 fight is like like the coolest thing but that fight pissed me off so bad because it was the only
01:07:57 one i had like a real like a trouble on like i found that one pretty easy actually for whatever
01:08:02 reason the teleporting it's that that guy's literally tips fedora teleports behind you uh
01:08:08 fucking i don't know whatever oh nothing personal like once they fuse together and the kid would
01:08:15 fucking throw all the magic at you and then teleport away oh there's the best i loved it
01:08:19 bitch but i think aldrich like in terms of the attacks and like how fucking rad the arena is and
01:08:25 everything like aldrich you know i i actually want to that's actually the one boss that i found a
01:08:30 little bit disappointed because uh disappointed in i mean it's like okay they had a choice when
01:08:36 they were designing aldrich like okay we've got a giant like consuming evil monster thing what are
01:08:41 we are we gonna like go the route of like having you fight a giant sludge monster thing or are we
01:08:46 gonna have it like you know use the powers of the people you know because like it's puppeting
01:08:51 gwyndolin which is really cool and it's cool for gwyndolin even though like god did you read the
01:08:56 description of that soul because it's like he's been like being consumed for like thousands of
01:09:01 years still alive in eternal torment yeah it's fucking horrific but like it's a i found it a
01:09:06 little bit disappointing because like you don't really get to see and experience aldrich there
01:09:11 should have been a cutscene for that for that fight what's that yeah there was a there i think
01:09:15 there should have been a cutscene dude there really should have been a part two where you've
01:09:18 defeated like the puppet and then he like rises out from the deep this giant fucking mass that's
01:09:23 like aldrich anything but a a blob that puppeteers well i mean because like all the other cutscenes
01:09:30 you see him come out of that cutscenes but yeah when you just when you go to fight aldrich you
01:09:34 just go in there and there should have been like a look at me i ate this guy and now this guy is
01:09:39 my guy he's a wooden little wooden puppet boy i i don't really mind that there isn't an intro
01:09:44 i was just a little bit disappointed by aldrich's presentation because he is like he is like the
01:09:49 dude yeah yeah i agree with i agree with both of you because of the fact that when i fought that
01:09:57 battle i didn't actually realize it was the same guy like i did not realize you didn't know it was
01:10:01 gwendolyn or aldrich um either like i didn't process like it says aldrich but i didn't process
01:10:07 that it was the blob guy because like the whole game i was like when i'm gonna fight the blob guy
01:10:12 you know right um because there was so much hype like he's got the church built around him and the
01:10:16 pontiff like based a whole religion on him he's like the thing and then it's gwendolyn like okay
01:10:22 well i didn't have to catch that it was gwendolyn at first i just thought it was like i don't know i
01:10:26 didn't even realize that it was like a blob taken over someone i just thought it was a crazy snake
01:10:31 queen you know like i really just thought it was that so i was like oh i guess i'm fighting the queen
01:10:36 of anor lando yeah uh i mean the name is aldrich i mean all right that's on you for not getting
01:10:41 gwendolyn that everyone fucking knows that was gwendolyn that's on you but i didn't catch that at all
01:10:45 but then like once it was explained to me i understood the evil snake queen totally different
01:10:50 just like my favorite boss of all mitha the baneful queen from dark souls too when you oh i love
01:10:55 getting poisoned all the time that's you dumb idiot you're supposed to burn the windmill with
01:10:59 that there's no indication that you can burn that no wonder you hate it i knew it was just because
01:11:04 you suck at the game you don't know nothing literally no way to know that was a trick i learned
01:11:09 you into a trap to prove that you don't know nothing why does it catch on fire and you prove
01:11:14 that you don't know nothing i win i've been playing chess for years and you walked right into it who
01:11:20 who'd have thought that i would have had the worst fucking time imaginable on this podcast
01:11:25 when i was gonna talk about one of my favorite games you know who would have thought who'd have
01:11:29 but here we are i know i knew i ever since i announced like ever since i proposed this idea
01:11:34 i knew that me and jessie were gonna argue about dark souls too like i knew it was coming
01:11:39 because even though sometimes jessie will accept that dark souls two is a flawed game now it's not
01:11:45 one of those times well it's just if you say it too many times that eventually it flips that switch
01:11:51 where he goes into defensive mode about it because he still ultimately likes the game whereas i
01:11:56 hate it yeah i have i have a i have a whiny criticism threshold and if you fucking cross it
01:12:02 well that that happens but i don't i don't consider my dark souls two complaints i don't
01:12:06 consider whiny because for me this is a deep passionate hatred this is not like someone who
01:12:11 watches a movie and come home in the first day that after the movie's out they write a fucking
01:12:15 bitchy pedantic review about it no this has been festering and stewing in me it's it's a part of
01:12:20 my life in my being get it there's nothing fucking wrong with it there there's some things wrong
01:12:26 with it there's some things wrong but okay let's move on to more dark souls cancer that has eaten
01:12:31 away at me for years you know what's really cool you're like you're like garfield with the mailman
01:12:36 i don't understand why you fucking want torturing every day i don't get what you get out of it
01:12:42 hey you know what's cool the deacons of the deep boss fight i like that boss fight i enjoyed it i
01:12:49 thought i i love the concept of that boss i think it's way too easy it's a little easy um because
01:12:55 the thing is that the the idea of it is that you only hurt the boss if you kill one of them who has
01:13:01 the the red shit well and you can just hit him but yeah well no it just hitting him doesn't hurt
01:13:06 the the boss meter it's only when you kill it that it that it that it deals damage that's so which is
01:13:12 which is a great idea because that would mean that if you can't kill them fast enough because
01:13:15 they'll transfer before you finish hurting them i have never had that problem i think every single
01:13:20 time i hit one of them that's the issue killed him like yeah like because i you know when i played
01:13:25 the first time you know or every time i've played strength and like i would kill them in two hits
01:13:29 but there was like one time that i hit one and then i missed what the second hit and then i didn't
01:13:34 get my like my endurance was out and then he transferred guys and so now his health bar was
01:13:40 released like you know it didn't do any damage to the boss itself so i had to go fight the next guy
01:13:43 so if they had made it so each one had more health so that it was like a real like you really
01:13:48 had to time your attacks to make sure you killed them or else you didn't do any damage i think that
01:13:53 would have made it a really challenging fun if you were like a mage trying to do long range
01:13:57 shit that would be a fucking nightmare to like hit the right one i think it was just a balancing
01:14:01 issue like yeah i think it was a matter of like they couldn't find a way to make it work for everyone
01:14:06 so they just kind of made it easy you know and i think that that that took some of the
01:14:12 but some of the quality from it thematically the boss fight is awesome it's the coolest it's
01:14:16 just it's just all these fucking eldritch guys working in the church they're just under the
01:14:20 pontiff they're just all like they're just there they're like oh here's the dude guess we better
01:14:25 deal with this now i don't know if that like like the pope guy there is like a special one
01:14:30 i guess he is but i will say though that regardless of that boss cathedral of the deep was that and
01:14:36 iris are the two coolest fucking levels ever like that was the moment because when i was playing
01:14:42 this game it was like at first the first couple levels i was just kind of like yeah all right this
01:14:47 is you know it's souls it's cool i'm killing guys this is fun like i like how in the first level
01:14:53 on the on the wall like you can just avoid a lot of the big enemies like the really tough ones you
01:14:58 can kind of solid snake around them or you can fight them if you want like the challenge you know
01:15:03 but like you know you get to the undead settlement and i i think that's probably like
01:15:08 my least favorite area the first time but now that i'm starting to like see all the lore that's there
01:15:13 i'm really interested in it like i want to know why they all are all like tree people because like
01:15:19 you gradually realize like everyone has like tree parts on them and stuff something to do with the
01:15:24 world just going to shit turn people into trees who knows then there's the giant tree boss who like
01:15:30 if you kill him then you can't join the mound makers so yeah it's clearly like i think everyone in
01:15:34 that town is part of this like tree covenant or something but uh yeah i don't know it's really
01:15:39 interesting but i i don't know much about it but you know you these lore videos guys yeah i need
01:15:43 him to but you were saying uh sorry i was just going to say that uh before you said that like
01:15:47 irithyll uh and and cathedral of the deep were like the moments you really liked it i think that
01:15:52 um that that moment where i forget when you beat the pontiff no not the pontiff whatever when you
01:15:57 beat someone and you walk out on that ledge and you see irithyll for the first time yeah that's
01:16:02 the equivalent of like the anor londo reveal from uh from dark souls one it's the and if you
01:16:07 want an example of seeing this go watch the blue glow i forget which episode it is but see see
01:16:12 endless jess marvel at the majesty of dark souls three after the best part about that is he was so
01:16:19 pissed off at the boss and he's literally going this is the worst fucking game ever then he comes
01:16:23 out and sees that he goes like like i'm crying that old bait switch right but um yeah for me it
01:16:29 was like you know i got to the crucifixion but it's harder to be sean my favorite song of all time
01:16:36 when i got to the crucifixion woods that was when i was first like all right i'm into it because
01:16:41 like the way that the water looks there and everything is just fucking beautiful i love the
01:16:46 swamp i love the entire swamp and then like because i i did the swamp first i beat the abyss
01:16:51 watchers i beat the catacombs and then i got to i saw irithyll and i was like that looks fucking
01:16:55 incredible but i couldn't get in because i didn't have the doll yeah so i go back to the cathedral
01:17:00 of the deep like i find it and i'm like what the fuck this the fucking graveyard with all the
01:17:04 skeleton people who just keep responding forever yeah and you're just like oh man this is fucking
01:17:09 cool it's like the spooky scary skeletons place and like i i love this is like this is the thing
01:17:14 that makes this game compete with bloodborne for being my favorite of the series because like
01:17:19 on the one hand dude i'm really into gothic horror and like and or gothic architecture
01:17:24 and stuff and like and lovecraftian stuff like those are my that's like my aesthetic man like
01:17:29 bloodborne feels like it was made for me but my biggest problem with that game is that almost
01:17:33 all of it's at night and so every level just feels like the same dark oppressive atmosphere
01:17:40 and it doesn't like it takes so long before you get to a level that like really feels different
01:17:45 and really pops out that is true that is true you know like like like i would say nightmare
01:17:49 frontier because that's like the first level that's like totally daylight and looks really
01:17:53 different and you're like oh all right and then in this game almost all of it's during the daytime
01:17:59 like the only really dark areas are like the catacombs and uh and the place the the jail and
01:18:07 the place below the jail you know where you fight your the the prison the fucking yeah the dungeon
01:18:12 thing whatever yeah yeah like even irithel even though it's set at night it's so beautiful and
01:18:16 like shining out in out of the darkness it's it's amazing it's it's a marvel it's a marvel of level
01:18:21 yeah i don't actually think it's like the most brilliantly designed level in in a like a flow
01:18:26 progression the level design it looks amazing i think the level design is obviously based on
01:18:31 andorlondo where it's supposed to be this huge skill check all like it's all big enemies now
01:18:36 they're all a lot harder you're fighting them in like smaller like it's just like you you fight a
01:18:40 bunch of groups of big enemies and like but they're even cooler because like in andorlondo it's
01:18:45 just like giant knight statues that you had to fight a lot of and this is like these these
01:18:49 fucking crazy dancer people you get the sense that there's like a culture to irithel yeah you're
01:18:53 getting like because all the all the the fucking boreal guys with their icy swords and their fucking
01:18:58 spin moves all the time it's it's really there's a real when you meet one of those guys you know
01:19:03 it's one of these dudes it's great yeah i really feel like there's a culture here that i i'm not
01:19:08 really sure i've seen in another like civilization uh before you know for this and the way that when
01:19:13 you're walking through town every there's like the ghosts like people who i don't even know what the
01:19:17 fuck those are but i love them they're the coolest thing ever uh everything about irithel makes my
01:19:22 dick rock hard and then when you go down into like the when you just go under it like you go down
01:19:28 into the the sewer like area and you're just in this huge open lake and it's like because the whole
01:19:33 level up to that point is fairly linear it's like guiding you through a bunch of like tough and
01:19:37 counters but then you go down and you're like exploring this whole other side of these disgusting
01:19:43 fucking hideous mosquito monsters down there jesus christ and then you emerge back into the thing
01:19:48 and who's who's sitting there with some hot estus stew waiting for you seagward seagward is my
01:19:54 fucking nigga jesus christ is the coolest guy ever did you did you know that every time in that
01:19:59 game that you find a pot of estus stew or whatever z word made it i did not know you can thank him for
01:20:05 that shit yep god he's the coolest guy in the world i love him by the way another awesome thing
01:20:10 i love about this game that i've appreciating more on like my uh as i play it again is the way that
01:20:15 the whole world like the way that you play through the game mo most of the time like there's this even
01:20:20 one area called the path of sacrifice like the whole world is structured in sort of a funnel
01:20:26 where people and you see this in like the the undead settlement like the whole world is sort of
01:20:30 built in this operation of like funneling food and funneling like good like stuff for
01:20:36 eldritch to consume all the way back to anor landa when i realized that nice notice like the guys in
01:20:41 cages like that's what they're doing like the the missionaries they're recruiting people like
01:20:45 those big fat bitches what they're doing is they're out recruiting people to come be uh eldritch
01:20:50 worshipers it's all fucking awesome it's the coolest thing ever man i love it i'm taking now
01:20:57 that i've played like all these games i'm taking much more notice of the lore like of the things
01:21:02 i'm doing as i'm playing through the games which up to this point i hadn't really invested in blood
01:21:06 warren i started to do that dark souls 3 with yeah the constant like hope of like looking out for
01:21:12 like lore stuff like totally i hope i see something cool and i can connect the dots but i'm too dumb
01:21:17 for that i need some more fucking lore videos to do it for me i'm a busy man i agree that like i
01:21:24 thought i was keeping up with it more so than the other like i definitely understood more than
01:21:29 i've understood before but then like once people started making lore videos and i was like well
01:21:33 i didn't get any of that so i want to know everything there is to know about like why is the undead
01:21:38 legion fighting itself something went wrong somewhere is it eldritch i want to know i want to
01:21:43 know real bad i need people to tell me i yeah i i got to say here's some some pedantic complaints
01:21:50 i have okay all right one uh why do npcs teleport to the the place after you like save them
01:21:59 like because there's that moment when you homeward bone i'm gonna say well there's that moment when
01:22:03 you save gray rat from a cell yeah and you like talk to him and then he's like i'm gonna join your
01:22:08 team and then he just like poosh away and i'm like well if he could do that why was he sitting in a
01:22:14 cell okay i'm i'm gonna tell you right now what it is there because there seem to be some implication
01:22:19 that like there's there's some magic going on when you take people into your service as an
01:22:24 unkindled there's something magical going on with that i'm just i'm completely gonna go crazy here
01:22:30 because it sounds like there's some weird connection between you and the uh the fire
01:22:35 fuck firekeeper lady or whatever i'm gonna say there's magic going on there because like uh
01:22:40 the that dude who you meet on the bridge who's like oh i've been looking for someone to serve
01:22:44 i've been looking for like a master a lord to send or whatever it's it's amazing to be in your
01:22:48 presence i'm just gonna say magic magic's involved you're a lord ascended i'm willing to accept
01:22:53 literally any explanation yeah it's just that like in demon souls people came back to the nexus but
01:22:58 it was always like you just kind of left it in all the games they just left the characters behind
01:23:03 you know and then eventually they made it there and then this game they like actively right in
01:23:07 front of your face teleport and i'm like what's the deal with that you know that's true yeah i've
01:23:11 been wondering about that too and then uh but then my other one i this one's a little less pedantic
01:23:19 i think it was just like an issue with the pacing of the game for me is that when you assuming that
01:23:25 you haven't killed the dancer early in the game then like when you kill the last of the guys you
01:23:30 need to kill it just teleports you into oh my god i cannot tell you how annoying that was and i'll
01:23:34 tell you exactly why because uh you you usually end up killing um the the yorm the giant as the
01:23:41 last one that's just how the game usually flows and if you've done uh z words storyline then like
01:23:48 if you he says a couple words to you and then you get teleported away but i wanted to see what he
01:23:53 fucking does after that fight because i've heard that like he does like he he like dies and i want
01:23:59 to know if that's true yeah but i don't know and so like i have to play through the whole game again
01:24:03 and go out of my way to not kill him last because of that issue like i i get it you get summoned by
01:24:09 the bitch but it's still annoying and also you have to constantly recollect your souls from that
01:24:14 previous boss like you know if you die to the dancer you have to make it back there and get
01:24:18 those souls back and if you do die to the dancer on your first try you go back to the bonfire of the
01:24:24 boss you killed you don't go back to the you know like you have to teleport you you'll you'll die to
01:24:29 the dancer then you'll end up back in yorm the giant's fucking chamber and then you got to teleport
01:24:34 to the fucking king play you know the kingdom yeah so that you can go fight the dancer again
01:24:38 i'll be honest i feel like this is one of those things they did to like really force you to get
01:24:42 it to like know what to do now like they didn't like they could have just put a message annoying
01:24:47 i do i do too because the thing is like i was it was so jarring because i would never have thought
01:24:52 that i was at the end of the path through the game you know like you kill yorm and there's like
01:24:58 you've if you if if he is the last one you kill then you've you've explored the whole game
01:25:02 and i never had that sense because i'm thinking well there's still one more guy left you know
01:25:07 so yeah where am i gonna go to fight that guy and i'm thinking that i'm gonna continue on the path
01:25:11 that i've been going on and then it's just like no you're back in the castle uh and then like it
01:25:16 would be one thing if it teleported you there and there was a bonfire immediately and you really
01:25:20 felt like okay i'm in the right place but instead it teleports you into a fight that if you lose
01:25:25 you end up back in yorm's chamber and it's so weird and jarring to like have that epic moment
01:25:31 of whoa i have to fight two bosses in a row and then like oh now i have to fucking teleport all
01:25:36 the way up to the the other guys bonfire because it just deposited me back in a nonsensical location
01:25:42 i i hear you on on all that stuff that's true i don't i don't quite agree uh that i that i dislike
01:25:47 that you're sort of uh sent back to uh to the castle to continue because it's very much like
01:25:53 boletaria which is really the last thing you do and you went back there in that right i wish that
01:25:58 it gave you the the agency to do that yourself i that'd be it was because in in demon souls it
01:26:04 told you how many levels there were in each place so like you you already knew that you were going
01:26:08 to go back to boletaria eventually after you'd beaten everything else but like in this game when i
01:26:14 beat yorm i didn't realize he was the last guy like because again i hadn't realized that eldritch
01:26:19 was the blob thing and i think i was just doing the math wrong because like there's one guy because
01:26:24 like ludlith is there and there's four others and am i one no okay and there's the prince is that two
01:26:29 guys yeah it's right and and i'm thinking the i'm thinking that and the undead legion is one
01:26:35 all right i was expecting all of them right there i was expecting the prince to be the final boss
01:26:39 you know yeah like he's the one who's been built up the whole game so like i just kind of had this
01:26:44 weird jarring feeling of when i was teleported back and i didn't like because i didn't know
01:26:49 that it was just after you kill whoever's the last guy yeah i thought it was just i killed yorm
01:26:54 and it teleported me back so when jessie was trying to jessie was trying to ask me how to get to uh
01:26:59 the the last like where to go because he killed yorm before eldritch because he didn't know how
01:27:03 to get to eldritch right so you know he's like where do i go now and i'm like oh did you fight
01:27:07 the dancer and he's like what and like he said i can't even ask where to go without getting spoiled
01:27:12 you know yeah that's the that's the yeah i'm with you on all that stuff for sure that that really
01:27:17 annoyed me let's talk about uh piece of shit which is those fucking guys in the in the dragon
01:27:24 place is the coolest fucking place ever it's yeah it's definitely red those fucking guys with the
01:27:29 chain axes that go through walls hundreds of miles away what who the hell coded that part
01:27:35 i want to find him and i want to kill his family that's like the greatest that is the greatest
01:27:40 mar on an otherwise great game it's a fucking blight on the entire series those fucking found
01:27:46 that place a little uh a little trying with my patience due to those guys that's that's oh i hate
01:27:51 those fucking guys and there's like 50 of them in one spot yeah yeah i you know what i know what
01:27:55 spot you're you're talking about because there's that one part where you try to go out to that
01:27:59 roost on the end yeah of the place and there's like fucking 15 dudes there and yeah i could not
01:28:05 fight my way through that like because there's no way to not aggro a bunch of them and their
01:28:09 chains like if you go into that little building they'll just hit you from everywhere so like the
01:28:13 only way i could get there is just to fucking run past them haul ass as best i could get that item and
01:28:18 run back you know not only are they so long have such long range but that they go through walls
01:28:24 like everybody prides the dark souls series i'm like it's hard but it always feels fair
01:28:29 the enemies can't do anything that you can't do you know but i can't fucking go through a wall
01:28:34 so well yeah i mean that it's it's a it's a moment of weakness in the story i would agree
01:28:40 the whole game is bad it's because of that i will say that i i i love that eventually i found harder
01:28:46 rooms because like one of the things i really loved in in all the other games is that there would be
01:28:51 these these certain rooms that are like so amazingly hard but they're completely out of the way so
01:28:58 like there's no reason really like uh in in dark souls one in the demon ruins when you like fall
01:29:03 down that that area and there's like all the toxic and all the fucking things that eat you and
01:29:08 shit and that's where like zeigmeyer's story ends like oh yeah right right yeah like that room
01:29:13 is insanely hard there's no reason to go over there if you know about it unless you wanted
01:29:18 whatever items were down there or you just wanted that challenge you know and i i think every game
01:29:22 has moments like that like in the bloodborne dlc when you fucking run into that cave where there's
01:29:26 the guy with the machine gun oh yeah like as a fucking nightmare there's like a fucking blood
01:29:31 starf beast down there like a million other guys and it's like what the fuck like there's just
01:29:36 certain rooms in each game there's a beast in there what the i must have spent yeah two hours
01:29:40 in trying to defeat that cave that one cave that yeah and i love that there's those those little
01:29:45 offshoot moments in each game yeah when i first played through dark souls 3 i didn't find any of
01:29:50 those but then like once i made it to the nameless king place and like that area with all those guys
01:29:56 is definitely one of them i'd say that one's a little too much of a pain in the ass because i
01:30:00 just couldn't even figure out how to go about it but there's a there's one room where there's
01:30:04 like an illusory wall where you can fight two of like the crocodile monster from the bridge
01:30:08 like or something like that two two really big down in the uh yeah i know what you're talking
01:30:12 about yeah to get it to get a certain item or weapon or whatever there's there's also yeah and
01:30:17 then the one where you're like before you're in the giant where uh there's three of the hand monsters
01:30:23 the fucking oh my god those fucking guys they're the worst they're like these horrific hand hippos
01:30:28 oh my god no those things are the most disgusting fucked up monsters in any game and they flail
01:30:33 around like they're fucking high on i don't know whatever yeah they're the worst fucked up they're
01:30:39 the most annoying enemies in the game aside from the axe through wall there's only there's only four
01:30:44 of them and like one you fight by itself and then there's three in that room down there three in the
01:30:47 one room yeah yeah finding out about though that though is like really cool because i was like okay
01:30:52 this game still has those optional big challenges i just i love that area that area forced me to
01:30:57 figure out that the fastest way to get through slow roll like slow roll like mud and stuff is
01:31:02 you equip a dagger you two hand it and you do the uh focus which is that dash and that it like
01:31:07 forces you to come up with new strats and do shit it's great i love it i hate all the fucking mud
01:31:12 pits they shouldn't be in the game they're just a completely unnecessary arbitrary fucking time
01:31:17 waster oh it pisses me off so much i hate going in the mud it makes you just do do my shit equip
01:31:23 a dagger two hand it use the focus move you'll just you'll just sound like too much work it's
01:31:28 it's mad just thinking i don't know i it's funny because i i really loved the swamp area but like
01:31:34 then when a like vadi kept putting out videos and he kept being like oh if you had to go through
01:31:37 that fucking swamp and i'm like eh i i didn't i wasn't that bothered by it like the only parts
01:31:43 you really have to go through the mud is if you want to get like a certain item the party yeah the
01:31:47 area right before you gotta get the items how could you not get the items i gotta get them well i did
01:31:52 get them all but like i don't know i never had a huge problem with it i mean you know that one
01:31:56 spot where there's three of those giant like tree druid the other fuckers around a bunch of items
01:32:00 that was like that was challenging but i did get through it right before the swamp where you're
01:32:05 with the crabs and it's sort of it looks like it's like directly out of the fellowship of the
01:32:10 ring at the end where Boramir dies it's like that it's literally that place that place is awesome
01:32:16 but then it goes into the fucking swamp and you gotta walk through that slow ass muddy water you
01:32:21 gotta fight those fucking werewolves who jump on your fucking head from 50 feet away you can't
01:32:25 fucking die i hate those motherfuckers you gotta oh man those guys yeah it's like 50 000 basilists
01:32:30 all coming around you at once gang rape and you turn into a stone there's those fucking tree guys
01:32:35 there's so tall i want to take that part out of the game and i want to package you help and i want
01:32:39 to put poop in that package and send that package back to me azaki and say this is my poop on your
01:32:44 level which is also i think uh i think i possibly like the swamp because it was purple and i just
01:32:49 think purple areas are the coolest purple um and i i do like how like there's a lot of there's a
01:32:55 ton of big enemies in this game that you have no reason to fight like the crabs unless you want
01:33:00 their rings like there's just a ton of big enemies who just drop some really cool ring and like you
01:33:07 know you could completely for like you don't have to fight a single crab in this game but if you
01:33:11 almost all of them will drop something special they get agroed so you know you get you get into
01:33:16 some yeah but you can easily escape like they're usually out of the way i have to fight them because
01:33:20 i hate them yeah hey crabs are cool dog i'm a cancer i don't respect like crabs to live
01:33:27 dude did you guys know have you guys seen this there was uh some shit on on v of uh you know those
01:33:31 giant skeleton balls in like the dungeon that roll up and down those staircases uh the the lower one
01:33:37 when it when you kill like the the hat guy that like if you kill a skeleton with a hat like they
01:33:42 no longer survive hitting against walls for some reason did you say just now that crabs are a
01:33:47 cancer that was a funny joke that's that's hilarious okay so when you do that nate said that he was
01:33:53 a i'm i'm against well then it was my joke then i made a point all right good good job anyway the
01:33:58 bottom ball when you do that when it smashes open uh there's a crab in there there's just a crab in
01:34:03 that ball there's a crab in that yeah and like people were trying to undead bone shard in there
01:34:07 but i did not know there's there's an undead bone shard in like the first ball but in the second
01:34:11 ball there's just a live crab just hanging out and uh there were there were some people uh on on v
01:34:17 doing threads about trying to guide that that uh crab back to like his his people in that like a fire
01:34:23 dungeon you know you know like all the crabs in that like fireplace but for so like he gets stuck
01:34:28 on the um on the on the entrance to the undead legion which leads out to like the swamp where the
01:34:33 other crabs are there's a threshold that he will not cross so tragically little crabby man was never
01:34:38 able to get home he couldn't do it it was they couldn't bring him down to the demon uh ruins
01:34:43 they tried they tried that too yeah let's talk about all those super cool like sad last in the
01:34:49 trilogy moments where like you'd find like the dead spider babe from the first game or you find
01:34:54 like the dead armor guy from the in uh in in lando the fucking dead giant giant oh man that was so
01:35:01 cool dude fucking because of you jesse because of the blue glow when me and victor went back to
01:35:07 andro lando in our playthrough like the first thing i did was go i'm coming home yes i'm coming home
01:35:13 and like uh this the moment when you see the the giant and then you just made your character fall to
01:35:19 his knees and i was like oh man that was beautiful taking that like we said this already but taking
01:35:25 the ashes to andre of the giant was like the most cry porn moment ever like i was devastated that
01:35:30 that was that was a that was a like an irreplaceable gaming moment how often how often do characters
01:35:35 like not only acknowledge one another but in a positive way in these games you know and that
01:35:41 yeah dude that is a great argument against spoilers can you fucking imagine if somebody
01:35:46 had spoiled that fucking part for me i would have lost all faith in humanity i would have died
01:35:52 an unhappy so i would have gone hollow if someone had spoiled that i'm just reliving that moment
01:35:57 andre it's beautiful man it is beautiful and i'll say this i think that's um like another thing
01:36:02 that would egg this game above possibly above bloodborne for me is the fact that bloodborne's
01:36:08 npcs were totally weak and this game's npcs were fucking awesome i liked that one girl the uh the
01:36:14 hunter killer girl in the crows outfit yeah i mean even she you know she's not that great
01:36:19 she's cool it's just yeah like the because most of the npcs like there's two types there's either
01:36:24 the hunters that you find around which are more like the adventurers from the other games yeah
01:36:28 and those are those are kind of cool but then most of them are just like civilians who have
01:36:32 nothing to do with what you're doing they're not like you they're just like people who are there
01:36:36 and the only way you ever really interact with them is if you go back to odin chapel which
01:36:40 you don't really do because it's you're you're constantly teleporting back to your fucking
01:36:45 the dream you know why would you go back to odin chapel i went to a lot just to check in with those
01:36:51 folks but that's just the way i most of them don't really do anything that interesting except for
01:36:55 like uh most of them are the whore and the priest and their interaction yeah yeah um but like the
01:37:01 old guy and the old lady don't really do anything interesting you know so it's kind of like it just
01:37:06 felt like it was just more people going crazy and like everyone else was already going crazy
01:37:11 like i love the part with the little girl and how uh she'll go looking for her parents and she's
01:37:15 fucking gets eaten by a pig monster and it's horrific but i think uh i think what's cool
01:37:21 about this game is that like in dark souls one everyone kind of had a mission but like all of
01:37:25 them failed like you know yeah unless unless you're able to say that logan succeeded too hardcore
01:37:33 right but like most of them actually you know who the coolest npc is in bloodborne is the guy with
01:37:37 the fucking wheel legarious because he oh my god you are so right dude that is part of the best
01:37:43 scene in that game of euphoria as he has smashed her to fucking pieces i was like yeah dude yeah
01:37:49 he's the best character definitely that's by far the coolest npc quest line in that game but in this
01:37:53 game i remember walking into that room it was fucking freaky because he puts yeah that's where
01:37:58 that pyramid head fucking helmet out of nowhere he didn't wear that up till now i think that was
01:38:02 on purpose holy shit that was spooky but okay go on but yeah in this game there's like a ton of
01:38:07 characters who all have like very clear missions and some of them succeed like seaguard if you
01:38:12 finish his quest line yeah he like does what he set out to do it's the best because that was the
01:38:17 whole tragedy of seagmeyer was that he just like wanted to adventure but he was always getting
01:38:22 you know stuck because he wasn't very good and then you know he goes crazy because he's so worthless
01:38:27 when you see seagland over his dead body oh my god right and then in this game you've got
01:38:32 fucking seagward and like not only does he fight like an early boss with you but then he'll fight
01:38:38 a fucking major boss with you and then like finish his quest and he's like i've done what
01:38:43 i set out to do that you fucking you know and then and there's a from what i understand the lady and
01:38:50 i have no idea how to do her like quest line but the lady in white who meets you in uh oh dude i
01:38:56 can tell you about her quest line because it's fucking awesome doesn't she fight the final boss
01:39:00 with you if you like wait are you talking about the lady in white or the lady in black the lady in
01:39:05 white doesn't fight the final boss dude let me tell you what happens with her one of her whole
01:39:08 deal uh yeah the lady in black does i'll tell you about that but the lady in white her whole deal
01:39:13 is i forget her name but she um is she was attempting to become a firekeeper which i guess
01:39:19 is a thing that you can do uh but she wasn't good enough or something but wait are you talking about
01:39:23 the the the blind one yeah the blind one i thought you meant i'm not talking about her
01:39:28 i'm talking about the lady who just shows up in the shrine and like she's a member of like
01:39:32 urea yeah wait no not urea she's in black that that's like a lady to kill me because i
01:39:37 accidentally joined the wrong dude okay her name is serious her name is serious yeah okay
01:39:42 her deal is just that uh she she's just a dark moon covenant dude uh trying to kill a certain dude
01:39:49 and as you go along you'll find out that it's her grandfather who is that you know you know
01:39:54 the guy who uh lets you into the mound makers covenants that creepy guy that's him and he's
01:39:59 that's her granddad and uh like eventually if you you get summoned by her a bunch of times to
01:40:03 like kill random dudes and the last one is that guy and when you kill him she's like all right
01:40:09 i i i fulfilled my promise to you granddad so like there's some implications that he like much earlier
01:40:14 in the game yeah but you know you want to give her some credit i don't know he invades you in in uh
01:40:19 in there he invades you as a mad face well invading isn't like killing the real one you know
01:40:23 like in this you like get summoned into his world or something and kill him there so uh
01:40:27 and then like she and then after that she shows back up in fire link and is like oh man thank you
01:40:33 dude uh i want to be your knight and she just swears loyal to you to you and then you can summon her
01:40:37 for shit so does yuria fight the final boss with you yuria does fight the final boss with you if you
01:40:43 do the like marriage quest line fully i don't know if you guys have done that but that's also
01:40:47 fucking awesome i could i could tell you about it but i have not done it but i mean i don't care
01:40:54 okay all right so i don't know if jesse uh wants to know jesse have you done that part yet i haven't
01:40:59 beaten it i i mean babadook spook killed anri and it was very sad because she's the best girl ever
01:41:06 you killed her in the ceremony yeah he stabbed her in the face oh yeah okay the ceremony is like
01:41:11 the most important part of the whole thing after that you it's basically you just are getting the
01:41:15 ending like you fulfilled the criteria you just got to get to the end there but okay since you
01:41:18 already know i'll just tell the people so like there's this girl uh well when you meet um yol yol
01:41:24 this guy who will give you those five free levels he gives you this like new like super dark sign
01:41:30 or whatever that's like a pit of blackness that's like in addition to the normal dark sign on an
01:41:34 undead that never goes away and yeah the babadook spooks got that shit and so like you don't have
01:41:40 like enough of them so uh andri she has you do like this wedding ceremony so she like kidnaps andri
01:41:47 does this creepy ritual where you stab her in the face and you like get three additional of these
01:41:52 like dark emblems from them and then uh at the end you just have the ability to steal the fire from
01:41:59 the uh from the fucking i can't remember what i was fucking saying you steal yeah you take the fire
01:42:05 from the kill the first flame and you get like this ending where you've like stolen the power
01:42:10 of the first flame or something i don't know some it's it's good you should go do it everybody
01:42:16 your mind is falling apart trying to talk to me it's completely whatever just go play the game
01:42:21 it's fun all right go do all the quest lines my full name is yule but hey since we're talking
01:42:27 about this anyway and i was gonna say the fact that that blind lady was a failed uh fire keeper
01:42:33 and if you buy all the spells from her if you like fulfill her purpose she then like i don't know how
01:42:39 but she somehow like becomes a full-fledged fire keeper and can perform level ups on you
01:42:44 like a fire keeper wait what dude yeah that's right that she becomes oh my god it's the coolest
01:42:50 thing that ever happened she fulfills her fucking dream it's the greatest but only only if you buy
01:42:57 all the good spells and don't give her any of the dark tomes and buy any of the dark spells you
01:43:01 can't do that shit or she has like a tragic evil ending yeah she just becomes a fire keeper it's so
01:43:05 cool it's like i never knew that that's amazing it's it's so right she's like in one of the dark
01:43:11 towers hanging out with all the like corpses dude she she she's in the tower with all the dead
01:43:16 uh fire keepers behind like the locked door and uh like she took down her hood and she she's all
01:43:21 pretty now that she took off her stupid ass nun hood and she's just she can fucking level you
01:43:25 up and she's just like i am so happy that i can fucking do this shit now oh man it's so endearing
01:43:31 i love i i hate it fucking but until that game is on fleek in this no fucking doubt dude like
01:43:36 you got yoria who's like lining you up with hot bitches to fuck you got this bitch who like
01:43:41 loves you more than anything you got the fire keeper of course oh man it's it's over and you got the
01:43:46 dark one of one of the cutest girl in the game the emerald herald who comes out at the end of the
01:43:51 game to say hey funnily enough i was about to say i'll never love one as much as the doll but
01:43:56 this game has a lot more the doll i got yeah i gotta say the uh the doll definitely uh for you
01:44:01 you know the doll's fucking accent makes my dick rock hard like introducing the idea of reacting
01:44:06 to your emotes with the doll has made her just transcended waifu you know there's never going
01:44:11 to be a waifu like her probably for me it's just the the fucking accent dude and and the hair and
01:44:15 just the fact that she's a doll and she has dark circles under her eyes are you cold she's my
01:44:20 fetish good hunter are you cold i think she might be related to the fact that she and the fact that
01:44:26 yeah probably you wake you become a squid and then she's like your mom she's like she doesn't
01:44:31 mom she's so really she's like she's gonna be there for you dude even in fucking squid form
01:44:35 what a what a great woman what a good woman and that's what and that's why bloodborne is the
01:44:39 prequel to octodad you're a good girl you would be did you i gotta tell you i've been singing that
01:44:51 song from the sea hey speaking of squid men going back to the sea all that shit with aldrich
01:45:01 had like they had a premonition that like the sea is going to be like the new age after the age of
01:45:05 fire feels very bloodborne inspired cool stuff yeah there's there's i i thought it was interesting
01:45:11 that like this game because it has references to demon souls but then like in terms of bloodborne
01:45:16 it's like almost exclusively mechanic mechanical references like there's no overt
01:45:23 other than the fact that aldrich's name is basic like if you read it aldrich's name in japanese
01:45:29 it's it's spelled exactly like eldritch oh really ha may as well yeah he's pretty clearly a like
01:45:36 in eldritch or he's a mode but i mean the arena the arena of the soul of cinder i feel like it's
01:45:42 definitely an homage of sorts to gherman's arena or possibly they're just like okay that worked
01:45:46 let's just do that again you know i think it could easily just be that yeah i would say i don't i
01:45:52 don't think that having an eldritch thing is like a reference to bloodborne though because all the
01:45:55 games were lovecraftian from the beginning you fought fucking cthulhu's in the first game you
01:46:00 sure did well they're i mean they're mind flayers which are a dnd thing but i mean yeah same shit
01:46:05 well i mean it's just very like call of cthulhu esk like the way i always thought it was like
01:46:10 somewhere between dnd and call of cthulhu was like the idea of of uh of demon souls have i
01:46:15 mentioned how dope latria is in demon souls just going up up up getting carried like you fight the
01:46:21 those fucking the clones that aren't real and then you get to the old monk and he's this creepy-ass
01:46:26 dude with the robe and it just becomes some dude's hat oh my god it was fucking insane demon
01:46:30 souls is one of the coolest games ever it is no doubt demon souls demon souls i like demon souls
01:46:42 that's how it goes right but yeah i think overall though like when i played through dark souls 3 it
01:46:46 was like that there was that first initial moment of like all right well that was kind of short
01:46:51 and a little easy and i don't know if it was as memorable as like you know where demon souls every
01:46:55 level was so distinct and different and dark souls felt so new and fresh and like even when you play
01:47:00 it today you can appreciate how new it felt at the time and how how big and open that world felt
01:47:06 and and dark souls 3 definitely feels less open it definitely feels less unique and new but yeah
01:47:12 it's again i think the replayability of it is so much stronger than any of the other games that like
01:47:17 this is the one i'll keep playing forever you know this is the one that i mean i never in none of
01:47:22 the other games that i pick it up like immediately and start playing again and then this one i was
01:47:27 just like i don't want to leave i don't want to be done it's so satisfying to play like
01:47:31 it's just so much fun and everything's cool and every location is there's there's no bad part
01:47:37 like i would say in in dark souls like when you're replaying it and you get past and or lando and
01:47:43 then you have to do like the fucking god damn uh what's it called the fireplace it's just like uh
01:47:50 do i have to do it again all right everybody everybody all right maybe you guys can explain
01:47:53 this to me i don't think you can everybody says that the game gets like drops off after an or lando
01:47:59 i don't fucking buy that shit i love every part of that game i love the fireplace
01:48:05 i mean i don't love the boss at the end it's not like the best boss ever but it's fun i enjoyed it
01:48:10 all like every single part the problem with the part was awesome the problem with the whole uh
01:48:14 with that what the fuck is it called what is the up to the demon ruins what's it called i can't
01:48:18 easelith lost easelith lost islet yeah um like the problem with that area is that if you played
01:48:24 that game when it first came out yeah then all those uh butts had like a dragon butts had like a
01:48:30 giant aggro range and it was like the hardest level in the whole game because you were just
01:48:34 constantly fighting these giant butts and it was like it was like yeah but that's the thing the way
01:48:38 that they compensated for that was to give them no aggro range and make it just a fucking place you
01:48:43 run through you know like it to me it just seems like it was really like like the time constraints
01:48:49 killed it or something like they had an idea they built this level and then they didn't actually
01:48:54 think up good enemy placements so they just threw a bunch of fucking dinosaur i don't know it's just
01:48:59 the way that people say like oh the game just fucking tanks after an or lando i don't buy it i
01:49:04 don't like by any stretch i just i think lost islet is a weaker level i think that maybe that
01:49:10 that what's is the boss there is a pain in the ass um i love duke's archives i think that place
01:49:14 yeah fucking really and design wise is amazing um the the tomb of the giants i'm not a big fan of
01:49:21 but i have i know people who really like it oh i like the two of the giants and then there's the
01:49:26 new lando which i just two of the giants is worth it just for when you finally get that lantern it's
01:49:31 like oh my god thank you jesus it feels great it's punishment i had it before going in there
01:49:37 i thought how'd you get it before i mean it's i don't know i had i had you can get like light
01:49:41 spells and shit in other ways but like the game like gives you a definitely i had a land skull
01:49:45 lantern went to there i don't know whatever maybe you did i don't fucking know um i don't know could
01:49:50 because i did that i think i did it last i think that was the last place i went to so i might have
01:49:53 got one but i mean well i don't know like the lantern that the game i mean i just think that
01:49:58 there's there's definitely in that game there's a few moments that i'm like when i have to go back
01:50:03 there i'm like oh god i have to do this level you know or i would think people would think that
01:50:07 about like sen's fortress or something because it's such a ball buster yeah but that's like mandatory
01:50:11 you know sen's fortress is a lot easier once you know what to do though like if you don't fall for
01:50:15 the traps you can haul ass through that place but like i think uh i think even uh bloodborne like
01:50:21 none of the levels were like a pain in the ass in that game but there was places that were like
01:50:26 that just weren't that memorable that are like i don't really feel like like if i was playing
01:50:30 through the game again i just want to rush through that area nothing felt like that in this game to me
01:50:34 like every single place was so distinct maybe the catacombs but then once i figured out that
01:50:40 you could skip like half the catacombs just by dropping down that first ledge when you walk in
01:50:44 then it's not even that big of a pain you know i don't know what you're talking about but i believe
01:50:47 you yeah well because you don't have to run like when the roly ball is there oh that yeah okay i
01:50:53 know what you're talking about i know the exact right when you walk into the catacombs you could
01:50:56 just drop down and skip that whole other part dude because those fucking skelemangs with their
01:51:00 fucking tip fedora shuriken throwing teleporting around geez christ those are fucking annoying
01:51:05 but yeah once i like once i knew that and i went through it like the easier way i was like okay this
01:51:09 place isn't like that much of a pain and demon ruins as well like the first time i went to demon
01:51:13 ruins it felt like a fucking labyrinth and i was like where the hell am i i love the demon ruins i
01:51:17 thought that was so much fun because like i man that was actually one of my favorite moments in the
01:51:22 game because i'm just going along you know that uh the the ballista is like shooting bolts at you
01:51:27 and i'm just i didn't even know that existed i'm just walking along the ground
01:51:30 one hits near me it breaks the ground and i fall into the demon ruins and i'm like holy
01:51:35 shit i what the fuck yeah i just haven't seen that like i know that that happens to a lot of people
01:51:40 but i've never seen it just happened to me and it was so awesome oh man it was rad what happened
01:51:43 you went through the floor do yeah if if you're running around in the lake like there's a there's
01:51:48 one spot where if the ballista shoots the ground there the ground just falls out from under you
01:51:52 and you fall into the demon ruin i had like i knew about the lake but i had no idea that was there
01:51:58 it was it blew my mind and then like down there there's so much cool shit like the the spider
01:52:02 lady's down there and stuff oh it ruled what a fucking cool game 10 out of 10 yeah 10 out of 10
01:52:09 10 out of 10 10 out of 10 possibly possibly my favorite game of all time it's it's in the running
01:52:17 my top my top four are you know bloodborne dark souls three dark souls and demon souls so it's
01:52:23 in the running with those you know with that top four you know hey maybe we should wrap up but before
01:52:28 we do let's just say our our favorite build weapons i'm an undead legion boy for life with my broad
01:52:35 sword and my shield of want it's the best i haven't fucked around with the weapons a whole lot yet
01:52:42 but the one that i've been using ever since finishing the game was the uh the the the uh the one
01:52:49 that the fucking i'll know is it the icey sword uses the no the lightning axe the giant stone axe
01:52:56 that dragon slayer axe or whatever yeah yeah that's the one i've been using that's a pussy fucker it's
01:53:02 it's slightly it's slightly weaker than the weapon like the great i just had a great axe for most of
01:53:07 the game and then like on new game plus i started using that one it's ever so slightly weaker but
01:53:11 it does lightning damage which a lot of enemies are surprisingly weak too so like especially that
01:53:17 made the osiris fight fucking awesome yeah dragon so i'm like oh yeah so i go in there and start
01:53:23 spamming my weapon art on him and i was like fuck yeah fuck you osiris what the fuck is that guy's
01:53:27 deal he's like gotta dude that is the do you realize that he you know that he is the king right
01:53:33 he is king lothric he's he's king lothric what because if you there's certain item descriptions
01:53:39 that say that king lothric at some point went insane and started trying to become a dragon oh
01:53:44 he was studying ceaths like uh like all of his knowledge i missed all of that yeah that's that's
01:53:50 why the brothers are in charge now the princes because the king fucking went down and went insane
01:53:55 and somehow i have no idea how transformed into a dragon i have no idea what the fuck osilot is
01:54:01 yeah that's why he's a baby or like you can hear a cry so like it's maybe real what i don't know
01:54:06 that is the most out of all the lore i want to know please anyone who makes lore videos please
01:54:11 fucking explain osiris and osiris that is by far the most curious i am about anything in this game
01:54:17 i want to know everything about him he's so fucking cool his voice is all the voice acting in this
01:54:22 game is top notch he should he should have been king osiris should have been like you're pretty good
