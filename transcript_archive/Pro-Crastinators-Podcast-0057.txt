00:00:00 I have rights, you have rights, even animals has rights.
00:00:08 So earlier on I got in two professors, an animal rights activist, and a woman with a hedgehog to ask them some questions.
00:00:17 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best guy ever and Mumkey Jones is here.
00:00:35 Hello everyone, I'm the nostalgia Mumkey. I remember it so you don't have to.
00:00:40 Classic comedy. Hippocrit is here.
00:00:44 I don't have anything after that. That's a good one.
00:00:48 That really stole the show. We should just quit right now.
00:00:51 What a great bit. You should start a whole thing about that. You should start a whole channel and branch out and make it a whole franchise.
00:01:01 I bet that channel would be awesome. I feel like you can incorporate wearing glasses into this character that you've just come up with.
00:01:10 Yeah, that Mumkey with the glasses. Yeah, that's a good one.
00:01:14 I'll do this great thing where I take a movie and I condense it into six seconds, and it'll be like Titanic in six seconds.
00:01:21 That's a pretty good idea. Tom's all here. I'm here.
00:01:27 And I guess Ben's here.
00:01:32 Talk about cultural appropriation.
00:01:36 That's true. Okay, so today we're talking about Animal Rights.
00:01:41 I just finished my Monkey Studies class 101.
00:01:45 For my Gen Ed requirements. Fantastic.
00:01:50 National Monkey History Month.
00:01:53 That was in February.
00:01:56 Ouch, harsh.
00:01:59 We're talking about animal rights. Animal rights.
00:02:02 And if you believe it or not, there is an Urban Dictionary definition for animal rights.
00:02:07 So let's take a gander here. Animal rights.
00:02:10 A philosophy that suggests, does that evape? Did I just hear a fucking vape?
00:02:13 No, of course not. Of course it wasn't.
00:02:16 The vape is here?
00:02:18 That would never happen.
00:02:21 Guys, I think we need to punish Ben for this vaping bullshit.
00:02:25 And I'm prepared to do a monkey siren every time I hear this shit to alert you all.
00:02:30 That sounds like a good idea.
00:02:32 If I hear a fucking vape, I'm going to go...
00:02:36 Then you'll all know.
00:02:38 This is just going to be a game of cat and mouse of how subtly can I vape before I said it?
00:02:44 I'm just going to be pushing the boundaries every time.
00:02:47 Like that monkey with the symbols in Toy Story 3.
00:02:50 Yes, exactly.
00:02:53 Anyway, excuse me.
00:02:55 Here's our definition. Yes, yes, excuse you indeed.
00:02:57 What's the definition of douchebag who vapes all the time?
00:03:01 Ben St. Look at that.
00:03:03 So animal rights.
00:03:05 It's rare that the definition is shorter than the word.
00:03:09 Well, it happens. Animal rights.
00:03:12 A philosophy that suggests some or all animals have the right to possess their own lives.
00:03:16 Contrary to popular opinion, animal rights activists do not ask for voting rights for chickens or pigs.
00:03:21 Rather, they ask that animals not be used for food, entertainment, medical research, or clothing.
00:03:26 Some activists maintain that there is a distinction between the sentient or self-aware animals,
00:03:31 and those with a large degree of self-awareness are to be afforded the right to possess their own lives.
00:03:36 Okay, a little bit more. Animal rights are also largely tied to dietary lifestyles such as vegetarianism and veganism
00:03:42 who would hoard the consumption of meat products in accordance with the principles of animal rights.
00:03:45 There you go.
00:03:47 In this podcast, animal rights means animals shouldn't be treated any differently than humans.
00:03:56 If you wouldn't eat a human, you wouldn't eat an animal. Is that what we're going with?
00:04:00 I don't think so.
00:04:02 I think it's more like should we treat them like decency.
00:04:05 That definition seemed to imply that believing in animal rights period means that we shouldn't eat animals.
00:04:11 I love animal rights period.
00:04:13 That's a little bit beyond the pale of what I would expect.
00:04:18 There's other definitions here.
00:04:20 Okay, we're going to come up with our own reasonable definition.
00:04:22 I think the animal rights in general is a broad scope as to whether animals, any organism besides human,
00:04:30 whether it deserves any rights at all to its own life, to its existence, whether we should respect it and its habitat,
00:04:37 whether it's all under the same umbrella.
00:04:40 I don't care at all.
00:04:42 It's the worst topic ever.
00:04:44 That's a position.
00:04:45 I'm glad you signed up for this episode, Hippo.
00:04:47 Yes, see you later, Hippo.
00:04:49 You wanted me to be here.
00:04:51 You know you wanted yourself to be here.
00:04:53 You signed up, goddammit. Nobody signed you up.
00:04:55 Mumki said he wanted me to be here. I don't know why.
00:04:57 No, don't tell them I see that I got you and Tom here specifically because I like you.
00:05:03 You have a Hippo who is your son.
00:05:06 Well, he's not my son.
00:05:08 He's your daughter then.
00:05:10 No.
00:05:12 He's my roommate.
00:05:14 Don't assume he's gender.
00:05:16 Hippo's listening to this podcast and shedding a single tear as he hears this.
00:05:21 Concecutive single tears.
00:05:24 I'm just his roommate.
00:05:26 Okay, well, let me take my position here and we can go from there.
00:05:31 I think that I actually, I was going to say my first thought was no animals deserve any rights at all, including humans can do whatever they want to animals and I do not give a fuck.
00:05:43 I've changed that opinion slightly because I realized that if that definition was if I use that, I don't actually think humans have very, you know, I don't think that human intelligence is anything particularly like special in the sense that it distinguishes us from animals.
00:05:57 We're just better at achieving our goals.
00:05:59 What I'm going to say is I think, yeah, well, you know, you're smarter than animals.
00:06:04 No, no, we are.
00:06:05 We are definitely smarter.
00:06:06 But for example, some humans have intelligence that is, I mean, not like animal level, but like closer to animal level.
00:06:12 So like, where does the, where does the cutoff lie?
00:06:15 I think even somebody with a Down syndrome is smarter than a gopher.
00:06:18 I'm not disputing that at all.
00:06:20 But what I am saying is there is like a measurable scale of intelligence and you say all animals don't matter.
00:06:26 You should take like like something like a dolphin, people say, right? Dolphins are generally pretty smart.
00:06:30 Yeah.
00:06:31 If you can measure the intelligence of a dolphin and say that it is worth keeping and I don't know what the standard should be.
00:06:36 But if we could figure that out, that should be the standard for whether or not we care about it.
00:06:41 I have a thought on this.
00:06:43 Dolphins, people like dolphins because, you know, they're like, they can do tricks.
00:06:48 They can talk.
00:06:49 They'd be like, and we're like, oh, that's nice.
00:06:52 You know, I like that thing.
00:06:53 I won't kill it.
00:06:54 And any animal that has, has made us enamored with it so that we don't kill it is smart enough to live.
00:07:03 I think it's just, there's no like a level of intelligence.
00:07:06 There's no like a data point.
00:07:08 There's no math number that we can attribute to any like on a scale.
00:07:13 What animals should we kill and what should we not?
00:07:16 I disagree.
00:07:17 I think, I think if we like animals to be alive, then they should live.
00:07:21 Okay, but just think about it for a second.
00:07:23 What you're doing there is just making an emotional argument for things that humans like.
00:07:27 Yeah, exactly.
00:07:28 That's my point.
00:07:29 I don't care about like, oh, what's the, we should try to like categorize everything and make it like a hard distinction.
00:07:37 If you like your dog, you shouldn't eat your dog.
00:07:40 But if other people don't care about their dogs, they can eat them.
00:07:43 It just depends on who you are and where you are in the society around you.
00:07:47 Here's the reason why there's a flaw in that argument.
00:07:49 Because what if humans were to someday meet some organism that was, you know, human level intelligence or higher, who knows,
00:07:56 but was just repellent on many levels, kind of like the bugs from Starship Troopers.
00:08:01 What if we were to encounter a species like that and just assume that they were bad and gross and we didn't like them,
00:08:07 even if like, so I'm proposing a universal standard for, we will care about a creature.
00:08:12 I don't know what those bugs are like.
00:08:14 Can they talk to us with language?
00:08:17 Yeah.
00:08:18 Well, they do communicate with each other.
00:08:20 Okay, a lot of them are just grunts, but they do have like queens and those seem to have like human level intelligence, if not higher.
00:08:26 Not like super intelligence.
00:08:27 Well, then she should be an ambassador and then people will be like, oh, I guess these people, these are like, this is a different race.
00:08:34 We should be treating them like a minority.
00:08:37 Well, that's totally true.
00:08:39 Yeah, so like terribly.
00:08:40 So like herd them into camps and cook them and eat them.
00:08:43 Yeah.
00:08:44 Well, okay, I think Starship Troopers is actually a great example of this because the whole deal behind Starship Troopers,
00:08:50 fantastic movie, everybody go watch it if you haven't, is that humans got into this war with the bugs based mostly on a misunderstanding.
00:08:58 A bug war, if you will.
00:08:59 It was in fact a bug war.
00:09:00 It was 100% a bug war if only Mochi was here.
00:09:03 I forgot about the bug war.
00:09:05 You should never forget about the bug war.
00:09:07 Every day, Ben.
00:09:08 Oh my God, I'm part of the problem.
00:09:11 That's right.
00:09:12 The Syrian refugee crisis wages on every day and you just turn a blind eye to it, Ben.
00:09:16 So too does the bug war.
00:09:18 Yeah, that describes me too.
00:09:21 Okay, so in that movie, okay, the point is that humans in that movie don't give a fuck about the bugs because they're gross and they don't understand them.
00:09:29 Even though like throughout the movie, there are clearly signs that the bugs are only defending their territory and are only like retaliating against humans because humans, you know, aggressed against them
00:09:39 and are like trying to colonize their solar system and shit.
00:09:43 So that's why the bugs attack humans.
00:09:45 It's based totally on a misunderstanding, whereas they could totally have gotten along or just left each other alone if they just didn't fuck with each other.
00:09:52 But it's like the propaganda of, ew, emotionally, we don't like these bugs.
00:09:57 And the propaganda throughout the film is fantastic at illustrating how nonsensical it is.
00:10:02 Humans just start stomping on cockroaches on Earth as if that's a fucking resistance against the bugs in space.
00:10:08 But you understand my point here, it's just that we need some sort of hard system.
00:10:12 I can alter my stance a bit to fit with that.
00:10:16 Say, for example, where there's like a bug comes and it says, no, we're intelligent, you idiot.
00:10:24 And then one of the humans is like, oh, they're intelligent.
00:10:27 Wait, we should stop killing them.
00:10:29 And then there's other humans are like, I don't care, I gotta go.
00:10:33 I'm gonna smash them.
00:10:35 Then at that point, it will be up to the humans to decide amongst themselves democratically or however they decide things,
00:10:42 whether that new species should be considered a beast or a potential, you know, new species we can talk to.
00:10:52 And that will be like, what I'm saying is a universal standard is to, you know, the amount of things we could ever find out in space, for example, is ridiculous.
00:11:02 I don't think a universal standard will count for the whole universe.
00:11:05 I think we should just take things as they come.
00:11:08 Well, I mean, you could separate it into different components.
00:11:11 Like if they are actively trying to kill you this entire race.
00:11:15 We're here today on the PCP talking about animal rights.
00:11:18 We're 10 minutes in and the scope of our argument has already expanded to a universal, extra galactic scale.
00:11:26 It has to though.
00:11:27 It doesn't have to.
00:11:28 Because I'm talking about a universal.
00:11:29 It really doesn't have to, Nick.
00:11:31 We can talk, believe it or not.
00:11:32 These arguments will apply to my thoughts on, like, why we can eat meat.
00:11:36 I like chicken.
00:11:37 So we can go back to that.
00:11:38 So we can go back to that.
00:11:39 I like hugging chickens.
00:11:40 Well, sure.
00:11:41 Agreed.
00:11:42 But like, what about something like, you know, doing makeup experiments on monkeys?
00:11:45 Like, where do you draw the line on that?
00:11:47 How does the bug empire, Nate, help you answer the makeup monkey question?
00:11:51 Simply.
00:11:52 Simply because the same principle applies.
00:11:54 So, okay, monkeys are really, really retarded and stupid.
00:11:58 Monkeys.
00:11:59 Monkeys are okay some of the time.
00:12:01 God damn it.
00:12:02 Like, okay, the thing, why do humans, you know, care about dogs, right?
00:12:06 It's because dogs, A, are generally like loyal and they'll, you know, they like your scent and they get used to you and they like it.
00:12:11 And they're cute.
00:12:12 And they'll be nice to you.
00:12:13 Right.
00:12:14 And they're also like attractive visually.
00:12:16 They're cute.
00:12:17 They're cute.
00:12:18 Most importantly.
00:12:19 Yeah, they're highly attractive.
00:12:20 Most importantly, that they're subservient.
00:12:23 Like, if all dogs were, like, by default, like, vicious and you had to tame every single one.
00:12:28 We wouldn't like dogs.
00:12:29 We'd kill them.
00:12:30 They'd be like wolves and lions.
00:12:32 And also all dogs would have true.
00:12:34 Yeah, because they're pure of heart, unlike humans.
00:12:36 Yeah.
00:12:37 Unlike humans.
00:12:38 Okay, but here's the thing about dogs.
00:12:39 So, we, you know, we enjoy their company as a species very much.
00:12:43 We've bred them to be that way and, you know, that may or may not have issues, but assuming
00:12:48 that that's just how it was, no problem there.
00:12:50 But at the current day, like, people like dogs because they're nice to us.
00:12:55 But does that, and that's why we don't...
00:12:57 Discussing animal rights.
00:12:59 And that's why, like, we care about them in general as a species.
00:13:04 But, like, is there anything...
00:13:06 Do we know that a dog really...
00:13:09 What is the value of a dog's life to itself, you know?
00:13:12 If you kill a dog...
00:13:13 Is a dog not entitled to the sweat of his own brow?
00:13:16 I know.
00:13:17 I don't think that he is.
00:13:18 Wait, wait, I think if you kill a dog, I think it won't know that it's dead because it's
00:13:23 be dead.
00:13:24 Well, a human that doesn't know that it's dead either.
00:13:26 Exactly.
00:13:27 Yeah, so what's the standard for not being allowed to kill, you know, just as one example
00:13:32 of something you can do to it?
00:13:33 Well, you're allowed to kill a dog.
00:13:34 It's not like you go to jail for it.
00:13:36 That's not actually true all the time.
00:13:38 Yeah, there's laws.
00:13:40 There's animal abuse laws and stuff.
00:13:42 Right.
00:13:43 And we're here saying revoke them.
00:13:46 Trump, revoke that shit.
00:13:47 It's time to go back.
00:13:48 Make America great again.
00:13:49 Let me kill my dog.
00:13:52 That's the single greatest social issue facing us today.
00:13:56 I'm a one issue voter, guys.
00:13:59 I vote for whichever candidate will let me kill my dog.
00:14:06 But to get back to the point that Mumki was making about using animals for makeup testing
00:14:11 and stuff, like, okay, so clearly the animals don't seem to enjoy that too much, right?
00:14:17 They're not into it in general.
00:14:19 You could call that mistreatment, but how much should we actually care about the suffering
00:14:24 of any animal?
00:14:25 And in this case, you know, we're talking about a monkey, a monkey.
00:14:28 I would say we should only really give a shit if it is like at a certain level of intelligence
00:14:36 where it's like cognizant.
00:14:37 See, you're just making it more complicated than it has to be.
00:14:40 Am I?
00:14:41 Here's what I think.
00:14:42 Just appeal to your emotions.
00:14:44 If you like the monkey and you want it to be happy, then you should just let it be.
00:14:48 That's not good enough.
00:14:50 Here's the thing.
00:14:51 I would not paint makeup on a monkey's face and then, I don't know, like blast it with
00:14:57 a fire hose to see how much punishment it could take before the makeup or opposite.
00:15:01 I wouldn't do that.
00:15:02 I would feel like I was a shitty person if I did that.
00:15:05 Therefore, I think it's a shitty thing to do and they shouldn't do it.
00:15:08 I mean, that's why you feel that way.
00:15:10 Is it because you're anthropomorphizing that monkey and projecting the feelings that you
00:15:14 as a human would have if that happened to you?
00:15:16 Because they share like 99% of our DNA.
00:15:19 We share like 50% of our DNA with a fucking banana.
00:15:22 And I feel sorry for bananas and the monkeys eat them.
00:15:24 Yeah, I bet you do.
00:15:26 But, I mean, we understand faces and two eyes and stuff.
00:15:33 Monkeys have like a face, you know.
00:15:36 As a human being animal, as a human animal, we recognize a monkey's face and we think,
00:15:41 ah, he's got emotions.
00:15:42 He's got a face.
00:15:43 He's got a family.
00:15:44 I don't know that.
00:15:45 That's an assumption being made.
00:15:46 Yeah, but we're imperfect beings.
00:15:47 We're not robots, Nate.
00:15:48 We can't be robots.
00:15:49 You'll never be a robot.
00:15:50 We should strive for perfection, Dave.
00:15:51 We should strive for a better system.
00:15:53 It's true that we can't know that the monkey has feelings like our own, but we can't know
00:15:58 that about one another either.
00:16:00 We can't see into each other's minds any more than we can see into the monkeys.
00:16:04 We can make logical distinctions about what other humans are experiencing.
00:16:07 I'm just saying that it's more difficult.
00:16:08 Well, we can make informed guesses.
00:16:11 That's all we can ever do about anything in our entire lives.
00:16:13 And that's what we're doing when we say, oh, this monkey looks like it's in pain.
00:16:16 I feel bad.
00:16:17 Right.
00:16:18 No.
00:16:19 Okay.
00:16:20 But I'm saying, why should we care that it's in pain?
00:16:21 What is the standard we're using to give a shit about that?
00:16:22 I have an answer for you.
00:16:23 That's a real question.
00:16:24 Yeah, it is a real question.
00:16:26 Because when we decided this would be the topic, when it comes to monkey rights, and
00:16:30 I'm not even meaming here, it's something that I'm actually kind of passionate about.
00:16:33 And I knew I was going to get emotional talking about it.
00:16:36 And as we all know, when I get emotional on this show, I don't give the best arguments.
00:16:39 So I actually wrote something up that I wanted to read about monkey rights.
00:16:44 Okay.
00:16:45 If you guys are ready.
00:16:46 This is only applied to monkeys or this is applied to other animals?
00:16:47 Just for monkeys.
00:16:48 Other animals I don't care as much about.
00:16:50 But, you know, I got a thing for monkeys.
00:16:52 Does somebody have like a bird chirping in the background?
00:16:55 Sorry, my window's open.
00:16:56 You want me to close it?
00:16:57 I'll get that.
00:16:58 The bird is very distracting.
00:17:00 That bird was waning.
00:17:02 All right.
00:17:09 In present day America, the monkey is still not free.
00:17:14 The life of the monkey is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.
00:17:20 The monkey lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.
00:17:27 The monkey is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land.
00:17:34 And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
00:17:38 In a sense, we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check.
00:17:42 When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,
00:17:48 they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.
00:17:53 This note was a promise that all men, yes, monkey men, as well as white men,
00:17:58 would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
00:18:04 Written by me.
00:18:07 Is that right? Written by you.
00:18:09 Yeah, exactly.
00:18:10 Good one. Good one.
00:18:11 So that's why I think monkeys should have rights.
00:18:13 I think I heard a similar...
00:18:14 Did I not hear a similar speech that one time?
00:18:16 I feel like it was, you know...
00:18:17 That speech came to me in a dream.
00:18:19 I said, I have a dream of this speech.
00:18:22 Well, I agree with that. I hate black people, though.
00:18:30 Oh, my God.
00:18:33 Of course, of course.
00:18:34 That's why I wanted to do the episode.
00:18:37 Now I'm done.
00:18:39 I'll see you guys in an hour for the questions.
00:18:42 Okay, can I just say, I want to clarify just one thing about the argument.
00:18:46 And it was just that...
00:18:48 So we don't care, right?
00:18:50 When you squish an ant, nobody gives a shit.
00:18:53 It does not matter.
00:18:54 Because ants are only bad.
00:18:55 They're only negative forces on my life.
00:18:57 They don't give me happiness like a monkey or a dog.
00:19:00 Well, right, but that's still kind of an emotional thing.
00:19:03 But even when you get to something like a spider...
00:19:05 But being happy is intrinsically valuable.
00:19:07 It's not just an emotion.
00:19:08 It benefits my life in so many ways.
00:19:11 If I'm a serial killer and I enjoy killing humans,
00:19:14 then that makes me happy, but it does not benefit everybody else.
00:19:17 Well, sure, but that's an offset.
00:19:19 That's an outlier.
00:19:20 We're talking like general humanity, not just the serial killers.
00:19:23 Well, but these are unanswered questions among human society.
00:19:28 I still don't understand at all what you're saying.
00:19:32 Okay, I was trying to get that.
00:19:34 I feel like you've got...
00:19:35 Yeah, go on, please.
00:19:37 Lay out your thesis for us.
00:19:40 Okay, it's very clear to me.
00:19:42 Okay, so we don't care if small insects or whatever die.
00:19:47 We don't spend a moment to consider their well-being whatsoever.
00:19:52 And yet we do when it comes to things that start to get a little bit more like us.
00:19:57 Like a hamster or a gerbil or whatever.
00:20:00 And then, of course, we get to like a dog.
00:20:02 Yeah, that's my dude.
00:20:04 And when we get to something like a dog or, I don't know, like a deer.
00:20:09 We hear about dogs more than deers and shit.
00:20:12 I don't know what the standard is.
00:20:13 So what I'm getting at is what exactly is the standard we're using
00:20:17 for how much we care about the well-being of these animals?
00:20:19 So your thesis is just a question?
00:20:22 No, no.
00:20:23 My thesis is I have the solution.
00:20:25 And what we should do is we should measure the intelligence of each of these animals,
00:20:28 make an actual determination about what their value is.
00:20:32 Alright, Nate.
00:20:33 But the thing is that applies to humans, too.
00:20:34 Let's just rank them all on a scale.
00:20:36 That's exactly what we should do.
00:20:37 And you should take everyone as an individual and, you know...
00:20:40 But there is no scale, Nate.
00:20:43 You can't just fucking measure everyone's IQ and be like,
00:20:47 oh, here's where they fall on the spectrum of worth.
00:20:50 What a brave new world this is.
00:20:51 But we have to.
00:20:52 Yeah, I think so.
00:20:53 What is your better solution?
00:20:55 My better solution is that you shut the fuck up.
00:20:59 I'm trying to solve problems here.
00:21:02 You said the thing about we don't care about insects.
00:21:06 I mean, some people do.
00:21:07 And if you anthropomorphize like an insect, if you watch it, you know,
00:21:11 you can be like, oh, look at him.
00:21:12 He's going to go get his lunch.
00:21:14 Like, you can make like little, like, you know, you can trick your brain into thinking of them as like...
00:21:22 You can be like Carl Pilkington and convince yourself that you saw a bee have a heart attack from overwork.
00:21:27 Right.
00:21:28 That's right.
00:21:29 Stuff like that.
00:21:30 My hero.
00:21:31 He is just the perfect example of this shit.
00:21:34 He's the cutoff point for what is not worth human rights.
00:21:39 He's just below.
00:21:40 He's just below the cutoff point.
00:21:42 He's right on the cusp.
00:21:43 So basically, it's not like universal that we all hate bugs, but we all like monkeys.
00:21:49 Some people hate monkeys.
00:21:50 It's not even about hating.
00:21:52 It's just about not caring about them.
00:21:53 Some people hate giraffes.
00:21:54 Some people hate hippos.
00:21:55 You know, it's just the way it is.
00:21:57 It shouldn't be about hating.
00:21:59 It should be about, you know, it's like whether we care about them or not.
00:22:01 Some people hate people.
00:22:02 Some people don't care about certain animals and they care about others.
00:22:05 The point I'm saying is that my stance when it comes to animals is that I think, you know,
00:22:12 I'll respect them.
00:22:13 I won't kick a puppy just for fun, but if he starts to kill me, then I will.
00:22:18 But if I want to eat that puppy, then I'll kick him.
00:22:21 Well, if I want to eat that puppy, I'll tell someone else to do it because I don't want to do that.
00:22:25 There are...
00:22:26 I'm aware that there are complications to this.
00:22:29 Like, you know, when a baby is born, like, it can't sustain itself, so is it really valuable?
00:22:36 Like, you have to take, like, the potential of the organism into account.
00:22:39 Well, there you go.
00:22:40 There you go.
00:22:41 You dismantled your own argument.
00:22:43 No, no, I didn't.
00:22:44 Real good there.
00:22:45 There has never been a case of, like, an ant getting intelligent enough to be worth caring about.
00:22:50 Why do you care so much about the value?
00:22:53 I'll tell you why.
00:22:54 Oh, I know why.
00:22:55 I'm thinking about the long-reaching ramifications of our current idea systems.
00:22:59 That is what I worry about.
00:23:01 I'm just like, let's get a good value now so that we can be ready for the future, whatever happens then.
00:23:06 Also, if you come with your little calculator, you can punch in the numbers.
00:23:11 Right, so we can hook up our brain storage spaceship and use them for faster than we can.
00:23:15 Just try to make gunbusters happen.
00:23:17 Try to make gunbusters happen, yes.
00:23:18 Is there just, like, do you have any humanity at all?
00:23:20 Why do you care about the value so much that it comes into everything you do?
00:23:24 I think that, like, the only ethical system that is coherent at all and isn't, like, hypocritical is...
00:23:34 Oh, fuck.
00:23:35 I had a whole thing and I cut out.
00:23:41 What happened?
00:23:42 I had a whole...
00:23:43 I guess we just couldn't hear him.
00:23:44 I had a whole thing and I said it and...
00:23:46 Say it again.
00:23:47 We can interrupt Ben.
00:23:48 It's okay.
00:23:50 The gist of what I was saying is, Nate, why do you care about the value so much when it comes to everything?
00:23:59 Say you had a dog and, you know, you punched in the numbers in your little thing.
00:24:04 You realize that it didn't have any value.
00:24:06 Would you just kill it right then and there or, you know, do you have any humanity?
00:24:11 It's not about just deciding to kill it.
00:24:14 It's about worrying about it.
00:24:17 It's about being concerned about its well-being.
00:24:19 That's the issue.
00:24:20 It's not like whether I'm just going to shoot things that I don't like.
00:24:22 That's just not something I do.
00:24:24 I just don't see why you care about, like, the intrinsic value of anything to the point where it comes into everything.
00:24:31 Like, hmm, should I worry about this?
00:24:33 If you're worried about it, like, on an instinctual level.
00:24:36 I'll tell you exactly why.
00:24:37 I'll tell you exactly why.
00:24:38 Because human instinct is not good enough.
00:24:40 We need logical systems to enforce human behavior in the right ways.
00:24:44 Hippo, I'm right there with you.
00:24:46 I'm right on board with that exasperated sigh.
00:24:49 You see, you guys think that, like, oh, well, how could you say that?
00:24:52 That's never been done before.
00:24:53 Except so much of human behavior today has been shaped by philosophy.
00:24:56 We're not, like, shaking our heads at what a rogue visionary you are.
00:24:59 Like, that's not...
00:25:00 Then what's the problem?
00:25:01 Then what is the problem?
00:25:02 Because you're just fucking talking a bunch of shit, man.
00:25:06 Everything I've said makes perfect sense.
00:25:08 I guess...
00:25:10 If the criticism is what I'm saying is too obvious, then that's great.
00:25:14 Then I hope that's...
00:25:16 It's not that it's too obvious.
00:25:17 It's just the way you're laying it out is just way too simplistic.
00:25:20 And it doesn't have any application in our life.
00:25:23 You're such an airy-fairy thinking about all these concepts all the time,
00:25:27 and then you come to real life, and then it doesn't matter.
00:25:30 None of it matters.
00:25:31 Can't we just talk about specific things like overcrowding on chicken farms
00:25:35 or, like, the way we treat a pig?
00:25:37 Like, these weird philosophical ideas that you have with Star Trek and shit?
00:25:41 Not when Nate's on the podcast.
00:25:43 You can talk about anything you want.
00:25:44 Nate's on the podcast.
00:25:45 I'm so sorry for leading the conversation down a path that you guys can't follow
00:25:49 because you're too fucking dumb.
00:25:51 You're little pee brains. You're little pee brains.
00:25:54 Just can't comprehend the next level shit that's going on up there.
00:25:57 It's too scary for you, Nate. I can't handle it.
00:25:58 That's right. I know.
00:25:59 It's tough, man. It's tough.
00:26:00 Well, let me give my spiel.
00:26:02 I think that the only thing that makes sense in life is to put yourself first
00:26:06 and to put your own needs above everyone else's.
00:26:09 Because if you don't do that, then what the fuck are you doing?
00:26:12 Someone's been reading a little Ayn Rand.
00:26:14 What was wrong with your guys' parents?
00:26:17 How do they raise these two monsters?
00:26:20 No, that makes sense, though, on some level.
00:26:23 Yeah, I'm willing to sacrifice of myself if there are people that are worse off than me.
00:26:30 Well, there's always going to be people worse off than me.
00:26:32 You can't help everyone. You can't do it.
00:26:34 It just doesn't make any sense.
00:26:36 You can't even live.
00:26:37 I think that unless you accept that I'm just looking out for myself,
00:26:42 you either just can't live at all or you're just going to be wrapped in hypocrisy
00:26:47 that you'll never solve and will never be acknowledged.
00:26:50 And I think...
00:26:52 Because you watch out for yourself. You do what benefits you.
00:26:57 You can help the people that you care about because helping them helps you.
00:27:02 And that all makes sense and is fine.
00:27:04 You can give to charity because it makes you feel like a good person or whatever.
00:27:07 That's all fine.
00:27:08 But ultimately, ultimately...
00:27:10 And this is just...
00:27:11 I really think I'm just arguing for basic human nature here,
00:27:14 which I think should just be the default position.
00:27:17 But I just think that's what makes sense.
00:27:19 And I think that that makes sense on a species level, too.
00:27:23 I think that humanity should just be...
00:27:25 Okay, humanity should put humanity's needs first.
00:27:28 And other speed...
00:27:29 Yeah, we can watch out for them because having them around benefits us.
00:27:32 But when push comes to shove and it comes down to it...
00:27:35 Yeah, I really think that we should...
00:27:37 If it...
00:27:38 To benefit ourselves, anything should go...
00:27:41 Anything goes and other animals just...
00:27:43 Fuck them, right?
00:27:44 Like, they got to watch out for themselves.
00:27:46 Even though they can't.
00:27:47 We're just lucky.
00:27:48 We're just lucky that other animals can't fight back.
00:27:50 Yeah, we get it.
00:27:51 But Ben...
00:27:52 So if you knew that your neighbor was viciously beating his pet dog,
00:27:55 you would say,
00:27:56 Well, I'm not going to get involved.
00:27:57 I guess that's fine.
00:27:58 Dogs should get beat if the guy wants to or whatever.
00:28:00 Uh, no.
00:28:01 No, that'd make me mad.
00:28:02 How does that benefit you?
00:28:04 Because it makes me upset that the dog is being beat.
00:28:07 So I guess it's on an individual level for everybody then
00:28:10 where if you personally don't want dogs to get beat, then go for it.
00:28:13 I guess so, yeah.
00:28:15 I'm fine with that.
00:28:16 Alright.
00:28:17 I think there's enough good people in the world to stop all the dogs
00:28:19 from getting abused all the time.
00:28:21 I would like to think so.
00:28:23 I like to think more people.
00:28:24 I think there is because if we appeal to the emotion,
00:28:26 most people feel that way about dogs.
00:28:28 Yeah, like on an emotional level,
00:28:30 most people are willing to eat meat
00:28:33 but also feel sad when they see an animal being harmed, you know?
00:28:36 Yeah.
00:28:37 Yeah, that's fair.
00:28:38 Yeah, but that doesn't solve anything.
00:28:40 That doesn't help the situation at all.
00:28:42 It doesn't solve anything.
00:28:44 The problem, Nate, is that there is not an issue.
00:28:48 You say like,
00:28:49 Oh, the issue is like, you know,
00:28:52 it's not what animals we should kill.
00:28:54 It's like, which animals should be worried about?
00:28:58 Right.
00:28:59 That's not a problem.
00:29:01 That's not a problem that comes up in my everyday life.
00:29:03 I'm not wondering what I should be worried about.
00:29:05 Just because it doesn't come up in your daily life
00:29:07 does not mean it's not a problem.
00:29:08 I don't see how it's a problem.
00:29:10 That's just blinding yourself to things that you aren't aware of.
00:29:12 But that's the whole issue.
00:29:13 That you don't think it's a problem.
00:29:15 Because it could be a problem one day.
00:29:17 How could it be a problem?
00:29:19 Okay, here's how it could be a problem.
00:29:21 It is possible that every cow that we murder for us to eat
00:29:24 actually is a conscious entity
00:29:26 and is really upset about it
00:29:28 and we're just committing genocide every single day.
00:29:30 That is possible and I would like to look into that.
00:29:32 Okay, that's just one example.
00:29:34 But I want to apply that logic across the board
00:29:36 to make sure we do the right thing.
00:29:38 I'm pretty sure that cows don't like being killed.
00:29:39 That's why I said it's just one...
00:29:41 But that's the thing.
00:29:42 Whether we should give a shit.
00:29:43 Because if it just is reacting to pain
00:29:45 and it's pain receptors, then...
00:29:47 I think people react to pain exactly the same way.
00:29:50 I don't think there's too much of a difference between a cow and a human
00:29:52 when it comes to death.
00:29:54 Reacting to pain and our pain receptors is exactly what we do.
00:29:56 Then tell me, Gib, why do you care if a human dies
00:29:59 and you don't care if a cow dies? What's the difference?
00:30:01 Well, I don't necessarily care if a human dies.
00:30:03 It depends on who the human is.
00:30:05 I don't by default care about humans more than I care about cows.
00:30:09 I hear about people dying in the news all the time.
00:30:12 It doesn't affect me at all.
00:30:14 You would care if a human died in front of you
00:30:16 or if a cow died in front of you.
00:30:18 Yes, both the same.
00:30:20 Because it's death happening in front of me.
00:30:22 That would not be the same.
00:30:24 No, they wouldn't be the same, but they would both disturb me.
00:30:28 Yeah, they would both disturb me.
00:30:30 Seeing something in front of you is a lot different
00:30:32 from knowing that something happens.
00:30:34 I know slaughterhouses kill animals and I eat the meat.
00:30:37 I know people die in horrific wars
00:30:40 and I don't eat that meat.
00:30:42 I mean, they don't sell that meat.
00:30:44 But if I were to see either of those things in real life
00:30:47 I would get upset and disturbed and want it to stop.
00:30:50 But I don't see it in real life.
00:30:52 I don't see it all the time.
00:30:53 It's just out of my vision.
00:30:56 But just because...
00:30:58 Okay, the problem right now, Nate, is that you're thinking...
00:31:00 You are saying nothing of value.
00:31:02 You are saying nothing of value.
00:31:03 If I don't see it, it's not a problem.
00:31:04 No, let's not.
00:31:06 The whole thing is that, Nate, you're talking again
00:31:09 from a grand humanitarian vision.
00:31:12 We need to set a precedent that sets all of human behavior
00:31:15 and elevates all of humanity as a species.
00:31:17 Where Gib is just saying,
00:31:19 I'm just trying to live my life and half...
00:31:21 99% of the time I don't give a fuck about any of this
00:31:23 because it doesn't affect me personally.
00:31:25 It's two different lifestyle choices
00:31:27 and philosophical perspectives on how to run yourself.
00:31:30 It's really what I was doing there.
00:31:32 I was just trying to explain to Nate
00:31:34 why I don't care about his issues that he seems to have.
00:31:37 You're not concerning yourself with the long-standing...
00:31:40 But that's not an argument against anything I'm saying.
00:31:42 You're just saying you don't care.
00:31:44 Yeah, and I'm explaining why I'm sighing
00:31:46 every time you bring this up because I think it doesn't matter.
00:31:49 That's why I was saying it.
00:31:50 It doesn't matter to you.
00:31:51 Okay, got it.
00:31:52 It doesn't matter to you.
00:31:53 It does matter to me.
00:31:55 Every week, it's just...
00:31:58 Nate presents some grand vision
00:32:03 of how humanity needs to change right now.
00:32:06 That's right.
00:32:07 And we all just listen and sigh.
00:32:10 Nate just needs to start a new podcast called
00:32:12 Nate Fleet where it's all about creating a better humanity.
00:32:16 How are we going to be a guest on there?
00:32:18 The best future ever.
00:32:19 Can I be the co-pilot on that ship?
00:32:21 I'll have to figure that out.
00:32:23 I don't know if you're qualified.
00:32:24 Nate, just to bring this down,
00:32:26 let's take it down from the grand philosophy thing.
00:32:30 Let's look at some specific examples
00:32:32 and then you can use your philosophy.
00:32:33 The only reason I start grand is because you can write.
00:32:35 That's the idea.
00:32:36 That's good.
00:32:37 For example, slaughterhouses with cows,
00:32:39 they're kept in these little bins where they can't move.
00:32:43 They can't even step forward or sit down.
00:32:45 They're stuck standing all day to keep their meat nice and plump
00:32:48 and juicy and all that shit.
00:32:50 What's it called?
00:32:52 Kosher?
00:32:53 If you're going to kill a cow the Kosher way,
00:32:55 which is like the Jewish bullshit,
00:32:57 you have to hang it upside down and then cut it
00:32:59 and then it bleeds out and it's very painful and torturous.
00:33:02 What do you think about all that shit?
00:33:04 Is that okay?
00:33:05 Here's the thing.
00:33:06 I think cows are under the standard of intellectually caring about them,
00:33:09 so I'm fine with all of it.
00:33:10 Totally don't care.
00:33:11 It can go on all day.
00:33:12 See, I'm okay with killing cows to eat them
00:33:13 and I'm not trying to...
00:33:14 I don't know why we bought it in vegan shit at the beginning
00:33:16 because that's retarded.
00:33:17 I'm okay with eating chickens and cows and meat,
00:33:20 but I'm not okay with it being tortured in order to die.
00:33:23 I think you can just kill it in a second.
00:33:25 You don't have to torture that fucker like the Kosher way.
00:33:27 Well, here's the thing.
00:33:28 I think that I am logically consistent on this point
00:33:31 because I say I am not interested.
00:33:33 I do think that it is not worth worrying about the well-being of a cow
00:33:36 and that applies to every aspect of its life.
00:33:38 You can torture it.
00:33:39 You can do whatever you want to, chop off all its legs,
00:33:41 bleed it out for its whole life, fill its veins with acid.
00:33:44 Those are all equally things that I am not concerned about
00:33:47 about the life of a cow.
00:33:48 Just because it's not as smart as you?
00:33:50 That's correct.
00:33:51 But Nate, if you were there in the slaughterhouse
00:33:55 and they were like, hey, best guy ever, come here a minute.
00:34:00 On the one hand, here's like a bolt gun.
00:34:04 You're working at the slaughterhouse because, I don't know,
00:34:07 just shut up, stop criticizing me.
00:34:11 Here's a bolt gun.
00:34:13 You got to kill this cow.
00:34:14 Here's a thing that you could just jam a rod into this cow's head
00:34:17 and it would be dead in a second.
00:34:18 Alternatively, it will pay you slightly more
00:34:21 if you will hang this cow up
00:34:24 and gently slit its skin in some points
00:34:28 and you need to watch it bleed out for an entire several hours.
00:34:32 Like that scene from Reservoir Dogs.
00:34:34 You got to play the song and dance around and stab it and shit.
00:34:37 So we can assume I'll get more money for doing something way worse is the idea.
00:34:40 Yeah.
00:34:41 Would you just be fine?
00:34:42 Would you be like, oh, well, okay, it marginally benefits me.
00:34:45 So I guess I'll just do it this other way and that's fine.
00:34:48 Would you just be fine with that?
00:34:50 I hear what you're saying and here's the thing.
00:34:52 The issue is this is totally involved,
00:34:55 but it's not a sort of a part of the logical framework.
00:34:58 But okay, so to answer your question, I would not do that.
00:35:01 No.
00:35:02 And I think it is for a very reasonable reason.
00:35:04 Okay, yeah.
00:35:05 I am a normal human being with all my emotional societal conditioning
00:35:10 built into me, which just informs me that, yes,
00:35:13 these things are weird and gross and uncomfortable to do.
00:35:16 And I have never killed anything in my life.
00:35:19 This is why I feel like you say you're not being hypocritical with your point.
00:35:24 You're consistent on your point.
00:35:25 That's your job.
00:35:26 That's your job.
00:35:27 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:35:28 But you say you're not being consistent on your point.
00:35:31 But even then, as a normal human, you recognize that you will think differently
00:35:36 from your big philosophical idea that cows are not important.
00:35:40 That's a nuanced point there.
00:35:42 Well, I understand, Nate, that what you're saying is that, like,
00:35:45 ideally, logically, it should not matter what we do to this cow.
00:35:51 And whereas you can't divorce yourself from your human emotional response,
00:35:58 even though intellectually you know that it's fine,
00:36:00 but it still feels wrong because of lizard brain or whatever.
00:36:03 Well, I mean, I guess I can understand that point.
00:36:06 Well, here's where I disagree with you.
00:36:08 I don't think it makes sense to say, oh, here's a cutoff point,
00:36:12 because Carl Pilkington, who's just above the cutoff point
00:36:17 and a silverback gorilla who's just below it,
00:36:20 they're very similar to each other.
00:36:22 There's not a meaningful distinction between two things that are very close
00:36:25 but on opposite sides of that cutoff point.
00:36:27 I really think you have to look at it as a spectrum.
00:36:30 I am fully willing to look at it as a spectrum.
00:36:33 Yeah, but then the problem with that is that at no point on the spectrum
00:36:40 does the value become zero, except at the very end,
00:36:43 until you get to an inanimate object.
00:36:45 So even if it's a spectrum, then even like a microbe
00:36:49 has some minuscule amount of value
00:36:52 that should be taken under some minuscule amount of consideration.
00:36:56 That is true.
00:36:58 You never hit a cutoff point where you're like,
00:37:00 okay, under this, anything goes.
00:37:03 But I think that...
00:37:05 You just have to involve practicality.
00:37:07 But that's what your emotional response
00:37:09 that telling you, oh, doing this to the cow is wrong.
00:37:11 That's what your emotional response is telling you,
00:37:14 like, oh, even though this cow is not as valuable as a human,
00:37:17 it still has some value and I still have some empathy for it, right?
00:37:21 Well, the empathy just comes from us assuming that it feels the same way about...
00:37:25 Well, I'm saying that your logical response,
00:37:28 that your emotional response there makes logical sense
00:37:31 if you view it as like an intelligent spectrum.
00:37:35 Only to some extent.
00:37:38 The way it seems, Nate, is that you're going into these logical situations
00:37:43 with the idea that if you were a robot and you didn't have any emotions,
00:37:47 this is what you would come to the conclusion with.
00:37:49 This is what you would say.
00:37:51 And then, you know, on the other hand,
00:37:53 you have the reality that you wouldn't actually say that
00:37:56 because you are a human.
00:37:58 And I don't know why you have that non-human robotic way of thinking
00:38:02 even in consideration because it can't happen right now.
00:38:05 You're not a robot.
00:38:07 It doesn't make any difference.
00:38:09 Our law system already is a divorce from emotional stuff.
00:38:14 We already have systems in place to do stuff like this.
00:38:16 I'm sympathetic to the idea of viewing things unemotionally
00:38:19 and trying to come to logical conclusions without bringing emotion into it.
00:38:23 I think that makes sense.
00:38:24 Emotion does not mean best, by the way.
00:38:25 We're trying to come to the best solution
00:38:27 which may or may not be our built-in human emotional response.
00:38:31 You're trying to come to the best solution.
00:38:33 We were just talking about our opinions.
00:38:35 Okay, well, let me say one point that is two Gibbs points
00:38:37 to agree with what's Gibbs been saying.
00:38:39 All right, yeah, here it is.
00:38:41 Okay, here's the thing, though.
00:38:42 Given the reality of what human beings are,
00:38:44 if I met a man who told me that his hobby,
00:38:47 like he's a farmer or whatever,
00:38:49 and he has cows, his hobby is to like drain the blood out of the cows
00:38:53 and fill their veins with acid.
00:38:55 He liked to do it because it was fun
00:38:57 and he liked watching them scream and die.
00:38:59 If he told me that, you know, I would be,
00:39:01 my logic would still apply that, you know,
00:39:03 their lives don't matter,
00:39:05 but what does matter is the kind of human being
00:39:07 who would do that sort of thing
00:39:09 is a psychopath,
00:39:11 is not a person who, you know,
00:39:14 is a valuable member of the human race,
00:39:16 probably, probably, like they are a freak,
00:39:19 and it is logical that they might also do those sorts of things
00:39:21 to human beings.
00:39:23 And so you can logically form from that position
00:39:25 like, okay, this guy has problems,
00:39:27 I don't like him, I condemn his actions.
00:39:29 On that basis, you can still condemn, you know,
00:39:32 things that are clearly bad that we don't like,
00:39:34 even if, you know, like the things being tortured
00:39:37 are not inherently valuable.
00:39:39 Well, I want to say something about that torture
00:39:41 and the cow thing.
00:39:43 The whole thing with the kosher meat being,
00:39:46 you know, you have to cut it by the neck
00:39:48 and drain its blood until it's all gone,
00:39:50 and that's the only way Jews can eat that,
00:39:52 and halal meat is very similar.
00:39:55 And that I don't agree with
00:39:58 because to get the meat out of the cow,
00:40:01 you just need to kill it.
00:40:03 And to torture it like that is just, you know,
00:40:05 it's a religious thing.
00:40:07 You don't need to do that to get the meat out, though.
00:40:10 If you gave a Jew something that wasn't kosher meat,
00:40:12 he wouldn't be able to tell.
00:40:14 He'd have no fucking idea.
00:40:16 We could all agree that these kind of traditions are retarded.
00:40:18 Yeah, traditions are retarded.
00:40:20 So, like, what I would say is that if there's something like,
00:40:23 well, if you like beef, you have to kill a cow,
00:40:25 and I'm like, hmm, well, I like beef.
00:40:28 I like eating beef more than I care about
00:40:31 some cow I don't know dying.
00:40:33 So I'm okay with it dying in the least harmful way possible
00:40:37 because that's just the nicest thing to do
00:40:39 is just to hope that it's the least harmful possible
00:40:41 and they're not being tortured.
00:40:43 I think that's a lot of people's general stance,
00:40:45 is they like meat,
00:40:47 but they'd rather, you know, the cow lives a happy enough life
00:40:51 and then dies instantly without feeling any pain.
00:40:53 Yeah, I'm on hippo's side on that one.
00:40:55 You're definitely right.
00:40:57 Everything dies eventually, you know?
00:41:00 If you give them a quick death,
00:41:02 what have we really lost here, you know?
00:41:04 I mean, everything should die.
00:41:06 I think dying will be eternal bliss.
00:41:08 I just don't want to be tortured before I die
00:41:10 and I think animals probably feel the same way.
00:41:12 Do you think the cow will get 72 virgins in heaven, Momke?
00:41:16 Is he a lull or not?
00:41:19 Yeah, this cow prays five times a day.
00:41:23 Did he strap a bunch of bombs to his oven
00:41:27 and blow up the barn?
00:41:29 He was gonna. He was just about to.
00:41:31 If you don't do that, you don't get those virgins.
00:41:33 Damn it.
00:41:35 What if he died to feed some like ISIS fighters, you know,
00:41:39 like some real heroes?
00:41:41 Is Muslim cow a friend of Action Draft?
00:41:43 Absolutely. They're best friends.
00:41:46 He's like, you know, as we all know,
00:41:49 Action Draft is a globetrotting, you know, cinema superstar
00:41:52 and Muslim cow is his, like, token racial friend
00:41:56 that's in the movies.
00:41:58 Muslim cow is down there in Pokemon Hell,
00:42:01 just real salty that he didn't quite get the chance
00:42:04 to carry out his terrorist attack.
00:42:07 Holy shit, somebody draw Muslim cow.
00:42:09 That's my favorite character.
00:42:11 The day before he was gonna do it.
00:42:13 Oh, I get it.
00:42:15 It'd be like having a burqa on the cow
00:42:17 because it's a cow, because it's a milk female burqa.
00:42:21 Oh, yeah, I guess it would.
00:42:23 It would look like a big black something or other,
00:42:26 like a rock, almost.
00:42:28 I got a big black something or other for you, hippo.
00:42:34 God, I don't know.
00:42:35 Okay, I feel like I got out pretty much my whole position
00:42:37 on this shit.
00:42:38 Maybe there's some more specifics we can talk about.
00:42:40 Anyone got any things that really upset them?
00:42:42 I haven't said my position at all, and as the only vegetarian,
00:42:45 I feel like I have some problems.
00:42:47 Oh, that's right. I always forget that you're a vegetarian, Tom.
00:42:50 I forgot I have no respect for you.
00:42:52 Yeah, no, that's good.
00:42:54 Okay, lay it down.
00:42:56 That's the whole thing.
00:42:58 Despite the fact that I'm vegetarian,
00:43:00 it's not something I project out in the world,
00:43:03 and that's why I'm happy that everyone forgets,
00:43:05 because that means I'm not making a big deal out of it,
00:43:07 and that's a good sign.
00:43:08 I guess you're doing it right.
00:43:09 Yeah, right.
00:43:10 When people don't know, that's a good thing.
00:43:13 By the way, I do feel like it makes sense
00:43:16 for a lot of the emotional vegetarians
00:43:18 to project like, guys, you're killing cows.
00:43:20 Stop it.
00:43:21 Okay, but anyway, I'm sorry.
00:43:23 I think that if that's your position,
00:43:26 I just care about whether a person is consistent
00:43:30 in what they believe.
00:43:32 I don't blame the crazy vegans out there,
00:43:35 because to them, they really think
00:43:37 that all around them are mass murderers,
00:43:39 and they're like, what's happening here?
00:43:41 Where am I?
00:43:42 I get it.
00:43:43 If that's your view, that's pretty fucked up.
00:43:45 They're wrong, though.
00:43:47 Whatever.
00:43:48 Well, I mean, my perspective is just that
00:43:51 I think that ethical consideration shouldn't be given
00:43:53 on any basis of intelligence.
00:43:55 It should be on the capacity to feel pain,
00:43:57 because you don't have to be intelligent to suffer.
00:44:01 If you're feeling pain, it's uncomfortable,
00:44:04 it sucks, and I don't like it.
00:44:05 I don't know about you.
00:44:06 I try to avoid pain as much as possible,
00:44:08 because I fucking hate it, because it's the worst.
00:44:11 So I don't eat meat anymore,
00:44:14 because I'm uncomfortable.
00:44:16 I don't try and have a meal or anything
00:44:18 that I wouldn't be comfortable preparing,
00:44:20 start to finish myself in all the actions.
00:44:24 So I don't have meat.
00:44:26 I don't kill insects or shit.
00:44:29 I try not to, at least.
00:44:30 If there's a big spider in the house,
00:44:32 and someone wants to kill it,
00:44:34 I'll take it and bring it outside.
00:44:36 I have this innate respect for life,
00:44:38 and it doesn't make any logical sense.
00:44:41 It's not even probably the correct thing to do,
00:44:45 but that's just my perspective.
00:44:49 Can I hit you with a hypothetical on that one?
00:44:52 Sure, go for it.
00:44:53 So let's say you discover,
00:44:55 there's a big old mouse in my house,
00:44:57 and he's tearing up my shit.
00:44:58 He's eating all my food.
00:44:59 Would you put a mouse trap,
00:45:00 or would you just let him live there?
00:45:02 Because you can't catch that fucker.
00:45:03 He's running around like crazy.
00:45:05 That was actually going to be my next point.
00:45:08 There's exceptions when it comes to pests and stuff.
00:45:11 If you have a termite infection in your house,
00:45:14 and they're fucking everywhere,
00:45:15 or you're infested with mice,
00:45:16 because we've had mice in the house before,
00:45:18 it's a little different,
00:45:19 because now they're directly affecting your domicile,
00:45:26 and your health, essentially,
00:45:28 because if you have an infestation,
00:45:29 that can quickly spread disease and fuck you up.
00:45:32 At that point, it comes under the same umbrella
00:45:35 as self-defense.
00:45:36 If a dude came to my house with a gun,
00:45:37 and tried to kill me,
00:45:38 I'd be chill with killing him.
00:45:40 Oh, hell yeah.
00:45:41 So it's the same thing with,
00:45:43 if your fucking house is infested with shit,
00:45:45 and you're going to die,
00:45:46 you've got to get rid of that, too.
00:45:48 At the end of the day,
00:45:50 again, kind of like what Ben was saying,
00:45:51 you put yourself first and shit like that,
00:45:53 but I tried to just go through life
00:45:55 and not cause harm in general,
00:45:59 try to stay in my lane, so to speak,
00:46:01 actualize myself to the best of my abilities
00:46:03 without interfering with anyone or anything else intentionally.
00:46:08 So that's my general philosophy,
00:46:11 and that's why I don't eat meat anymore.
00:46:13 I don't kill bugs or mice or anything like that.
00:46:16 I try and keep that shit.
00:46:18 The thing with bugs is, I don't kill bugs either,
00:46:21 but usually because I can safely get them outside the house
00:46:25 or they're not bothering me.
00:46:26 If there's a spider in a very far corner of the attic or something,
00:46:31 he can stay.
00:46:33 Spiders are people, too.
00:46:35 Spiders are people, too.
00:46:37 But if there's a spider on my computer,
00:46:40 behind my computer, I'm like,
00:46:41 eventually I'm going to have to go back there,
00:46:43 so I have to get rid of this guy.
00:46:44 But killing him, there's going to be bug juice everywhere.
00:46:48 I don't want that.
00:46:49 So I don't kill things mostly because
00:46:52 there's no benefit to me killing them,
00:46:54 aside from a visceral reaction to stop something existing.
00:46:58 But generally, I like to not kill things
00:47:03 unless there's no other way.
00:47:06 Didn't there used to be a soft drink called bug juice
00:47:09 that had cartoon characters on the lid?
00:47:11 Bug juice is a thing I had at Boy Scout Camp all the time,
00:47:14 which was a cocktail of different fruit punch mixes and stuff.
00:47:18 It was never very good,
00:47:19 but they would just put whatever kind of juice shit they had around.
00:47:21 But they'd have Yu-Gi-Oh's head on it or some shit, right?
00:47:23 I can't speak to that. I don't know.
00:47:25 Does anybody remember that?
00:47:26 I don't even know what you're talking about,
00:47:28 but I'll take your word for it.
00:47:29 I remember watching Kids WB
00:47:30 and there'd be commercials for bug juice all the time.
00:47:33 I don't know. I just know it's like a Boy Scout thing.
00:47:35 It sparked my nostalgia.
00:47:36 It sounds vaguely familiar,
00:47:37 so maybe it exists.
00:47:40 I would ask Tom something about that, though,
00:47:43 about his pain stuff.
00:47:44 It's not really challenging you,
00:47:46 but I think I would just want to ask,
00:47:48 to be the most consistent with your philosophy,
00:47:51 would you say that the ideal version of that would be Jainism,
00:47:55 which is this religion that is 100% focused
00:47:58 on causing zero harm to any other living creature,
00:48:02 to the point where they wear masks at all times
00:48:04 to avoid breathing in bugs
00:48:06 and accidentally swallowing them and killing them
00:48:08 in that kind of way,
00:48:09 and they're always careful to not step on bugs or anything?
00:48:12 Would you say that's like the ultimate extreme?
00:48:14 I don't think that's going a little too far,
00:48:16 and the reason I think,
00:48:18 I always say when I explain my philosophy,
00:48:20 I always say it's like,
00:48:22 maximize your own happiness
00:48:24 without intentionally causing anybody else harm.
00:48:27 I think intentionally is really important
00:48:29 because lots of the times,
00:48:31 in order to maximize your own happiness,
00:48:33 you have to unintentionally harm somebody else.
00:48:36 An example I use a lot of the times
00:48:38 is if you're going for your dream job
00:48:40 and there's one position for it,
00:48:42 in order to maximize your own happiness,
00:48:44 you've got to shit on someone else's dream
00:48:46 by denying them the job.
00:48:48 If you're in a situation where...
00:48:50 Doesn't make any sense.
00:48:52 Doesn't make any sense not to do it.
00:48:54 Then all of a sudden,
00:48:56 you're basically causing yourself pain
00:48:58 and the whole point is to not cause pain.
00:49:00 So if you're causing yourself pain,
00:49:02 in that situation,
00:49:04 somebody's got to suffer.
00:49:06 It might as well be the other guy.
00:49:08 That's what the capitalistic system makes more sense
00:49:10 because you both try as hard as you can
00:49:12 and the one who is more capable
00:49:14 gets rewarded and prospers,
00:49:16 and that's what we want.
00:49:18 If there are unintentional consequences,
00:49:21 as long as you're not intentionally
00:49:23 or maliciously harming anybody else,
00:49:25 it seems to be okay,
00:49:27 because you're not...
00:49:29 I don't think it's okay
00:49:31 to be like,
00:49:33 if I didn't mean to do it,
00:49:35 then it's all hunky-dory.
00:49:37 There's obvious exceptions.
00:49:39 If you fucking brutally murder somebody
00:49:41 with your car,
00:49:43 it's like, I didn't mean to do it,
00:49:45 I should just be able to go home.
00:49:47 There's degrees of stuff,
00:49:49 but just as a general guideline,
00:49:51 you're trying to do the best that you can
00:49:53 without intentionally or maliciously hurting
00:49:55 other people.
00:49:57 I feel like a good general standard
00:49:59 is your life.
00:50:01 I agree so far as you can't
00:50:03 really actively try...
00:50:05 If it's unintentional,
00:50:07 it's unintentional.
00:50:09 You can't set out to do less
00:50:11 unintentional harm
00:50:13 because the unintentional harm is outside your control.
00:50:15 And yet, unintentional harm
00:50:17 is still just as bad as intentional harm.
00:50:19 So I don't know.
00:50:21 I feel like...
00:50:23 I don't think it's worth...
00:50:25 I don't think it's any worse
00:50:27 than intentionally bad than to do it unintentionally
00:50:29 in the game of things.
00:50:31 The reason that's incorrect is because
00:50:33 when people do things intentionally wrong,
00:50:35 that creates a pattern of behavior that you can
00:50:37 use to determine what their actions are likely to be
00:50:39 in the future.
00:50:41 You can say that they are both equally damaging
00:50:43 to the world, but you do know
00:50:45 when something is intentional versus unintentional
00:50:47 that that person is likely to continue
00:50:49 this kind of action, whereas if it was intentional,
00:50:51 that's not the case.
00:50:53 Despite the effects being the same,
00:50:55 I think intentional is always worse
00:50:57 for you.
00:50:59 If I'm talking more like a code of conduct
00:51:01 and less for physical ramifications
00:51:03 on the rest of the world,
00:51:05 and that's where I think
00:51:07 that distinction becomes important.
00:51:09 To go back to the job example,
00:51:11 there's a difference between me
00:51:13 going in for an interview and then you going in for an interview
00:51:15 and you winning out over me.
00:51:17 That was you just being the better candidate
00:51:19 or whatever. That's unintentional harm.
00:51:21 But if we talked
00:51:23 on the train and we're both going for the same job
00:51:25 and you fucking made sure that
00:51:27 I didn't get off the train at the right time
00:51:29 so I missed my interview and you got the job by default,
00:51:31 that's intentional harm.
00:51:33 You know that that guy is a bad dude, right?
00:51:35 You know if he's done that.
00:51:37 We're aware that this is a shady person and we don't want them
00:51:39 doing that.
00:51:41 I'm pretty confused because I've never seen a cow
00:51:43 go into a job interview.
00:51:45 We're kind of moving away from animal rights.
00:51:47 Haven't you read the far side dude?
00:51:49 Oh yeah, you're right.
00:51:51 Belly washers.
00:51:53 The drink was called belly washers.
00:51:55 On the subject of meat,
00:51:57 I want to say something like
00:51:59 some people will say
00:52:01 some people will be like, yeah,
00:52:03 I know it's bad that the cow gets killed for this meat
00:52:05 but the cow is already dead
00:52:07 so it's not bad if I eat it.
00:52:09 That's so stupid.
00:52:11 And I don't agree with that because it's supply and demand.
00:52:13 If you're buying the meat,
00:52:15 you're contributing to the demand
00:52:17 and you're indirectly but you're still
00:52:19 supporting this
00:52:21 system.
00:52:23 That's why I don't do it.
00:52:25 In terms of
00:52:27 practicality, it's like, yeah,
00:52:29 the deed's already done and you're just
00:52:31 consuming flesh but at the same time
00:52:33 you're contributing to the system.
00:52:35 You're leading to it happening more.
00:52:37 My mindset is that
00:52:39 if I was doing that myself,
00:52:41 I would be uncomfortable with it and therefore I don't participate.
00:52:43 But it gets a little more
00:52:45 complicated to me at least
00:52:47 when you think about the fact that
00:52:49 the cows that are being
00:52:51 slaughtered for this meat are being
00:52:53 bred specifically for that
00:52:55 purpose.
00:52:57 Their life wouldn't even exist without this demand,
00:52:59 right?
00:53:01 Yeah, in a sense.
00:53:03 So that's where I get a little, oh man,
00:53:05 it's too tough.
00:53:07 They're still living creature and they're still feeling pain.
00:53:09 What is the net?
00:53:11 Are we talking about that? That's when it gets tough.
00:53:13 How do you measure goodness?
00:53:15 Do you judge it by net life
00:53:17 enjoyed by all creatures on the planet?
00:53:19 You don't. You don't measure it.
00:53:21 Every baby that we do not have,
00:53:23 everyone should be out fucking all the time
00:53:25 to produce more humans to have more
00:53:27 enjoyment. You don't measure it.
00:53:29 That's not a thing that you do.
00:53:31 You don't measure it but I'm talking about systems where we do.
00:53:33 But if you're trying to come up
00:53:35 with a schema of what
00:53:37 is good and what
00:53:39 is a world worth pursuing.
00:53:41 I thought we were talking about cows though.
00:53:43 These are all relevant questions.
00:53:45 Keep it to cows.
00:53:47 Keep it to cows. Talk about what could be good
00:53:49 or about cows.
00:53:51 I think Nate's baby example is germane.
00:53:53 Well, it doesn't matter
00:53:55 because it also applies to cows.
00:53:57 Oh wait, germane means good. I forgot.
00:53:59 So just to
00:54:01 apply it to cows, if we got two cows
00:54:03 and you don't eat meat
00:54:05 so you just let them live out their lives
00:54:07 and they die, let's say they don't have kids or whatever,
00:54:09 then that's fine.
00:54:11 But if you are a meat farmer
00:54:13 and you take those two cows and you breed them
00:54:15 and you make a whole fucking fleet of cows
00:54:17 by the end. And so let's say you've got
00:54:19 like a thousand cows now.
00:54:21 But after, you know, how long does the cow live?
00:54:23 Let's say after like five years,
00:54:25 you slaughter them and kill them. Maybe that's a lot shorter.
00:54:27 I don't know. But you slaughter them and you kill them.
00:54:29 And let's say you do it in a generally humane way
00:54:31 not like torturing them like the Jews love to do.
00:54:33 And
00:54:35 you kill them and you sell it and whatever.
00:54:37 So in that equation, the one guy
00:54:39 had like two cows and they had a great life.
00:54:41 You lived with them. They were like your pets.
00:54:43 They were your buddies. And then they died
00:54:45 as opposed to a world where you've got now
00:54:47 a thousand cows who all had pretty good lives
00:54:49 but they did end violently as they were killed.
00:54:51 So like which of those
00:54:53 is a happier situation for the world?
00:54:55 I mean,
00:54:57 well, I'm not talking about the world.
00:54:59 I think it's happier because now people have
00:55:01 things to eat.
00:55:03 Well, let's just focus on the cows lives.
00:55:05 It's definitely the first situation.
00:55:07 I don't know, man.
00:55:09 I think there's something.
00:55:11 If a thousand cows
00:55:13 live okay lives versus two cows
00:55:15 living good lives,
00:55:17 maybe the thousand had more
00:55:19 to bind good lives.
00:55:21 We're talking about, I don't think,
00:55:23 I guess maybe my differentiation here is like
00:55:25 I don't think quantity
00:55:27 has anything to do with it.
00:55:29 Yeah, why would the...
00:55:31 That can't be true because benefiting
00:55:33 two people is better than benefiting one,
00:55:35 isn't it?
00:55:37 Can I just say, why?
00:55:39 God fucking dammit!
00:55:41 Can I say what I want to say?
00:55:43 Jesus Christ!
00:55:45 Why would one thousand cows
00:55:47 live worse lives than just two?
00:55:49 Why is that part of it?
00:55:51 No, it's just because we kill them at the end.
00:55:53 We kill them for meat after several years.
00:55:55 Is that it? Yeah, that's it.
00:55:57 I thought dying of old age is also painful.
00:55:59 It probably is.
00:56:01 Then what's the difference?
00:56:03 The time that was lived between the two?
00:56:05 Those two had a higher quality life overall.
00:56:07 They lived, let's say, 10 years.
00:56:09 This is like a hypothetical scenario
00:56:11 we're laying out here. No, this is totally
00:56:13 applicable to real life.
00:56:15 We're talking about how we should treat animals.
00:56:17 Well, okay.
00:56:19 Why is it okay to
00:56:21 arbitrarily kill something
00:56:23 after it's been deemed by someone
00:56:25 else that their function has been served
00:56:27 now they're going to keep going?
00:56:29 Well, you could argue that it isn't.
00:56:31 I don't because I don't care about cows' lives.
00:56:33 That's my position.
00:56:35 You do, obviously.
00:56:37 I think that's kind of ridiculous.
00:56:39 It's like saying,
00:56:41 what if the state took care of me and my family
00:56:43 and I had seven kids but once I turned
00:56:45 40 they fucking killed me and used my body
00:56:47 for medical purposes?
00:56:49 Just to Ben's point, Ben was just making a question
00:56:51 about which of those is a better world?
00:56:53 Which world has produced more joy?
00:56:55 Well, if all the cows had
00:56:57 a decent life, then by virtue
00:56:59 of the more cows having more of a good life,
00:57:01 they all add up to
00:57:03 something gooder. I don't know how you're measuring this.
00:57:05 We're talking about
00:57:07 1,000 cows whose lives is
00:57:09 not great, but it's
00:57:11 just good enough that it's not
00:57:13 terrible.
00:57:15 It's just worth living versus one cow that had
00:57:17 like, yeah, this cow had a good ass life.
00:57:19 You know what I mean?
00:57:21 What do you mean why? This is the hypothetical
00:57:23 that I'm laying out.
00:57:25 Fine, that's the hypothetical. I thought it was a different hypothetical.
00:57:27 But if that's the hypothetical,
00:57:29 I would say
00:57:31 that's stacked in favour of
00:57:33 the two cows having a great life.
00:57:35 But I'm just saying, if there's two cows
00:57:37 and they die of old age, and if you have 1,000 cows
00:57:39 that get killed, if they still
00:57:41 have a decent life,
00:57:43 it's better
00:57:45 to have more cows because
00:57:47 there's more meat and that
00:57:49 impacts more people
00:57:51 than two cows that don't give any meat.
00:57:53 Even if we're talking about just the cows,
00:57:55 I don't think it makes too much of a difference
00:57:57 if there's 1,000 cows or two cows
00:57:59 unless you explicitly say that
00:58:01 the two cows have a much better life.
00:58:03 Which is why I think it's a weird hypothetical
00:58:05 that there's only one answer to that.
00:58:07 Of course it's the two cows.
00:58:09 Alright, to me
00:58:11 it seems obvious
00:58:13 that 1,000 cows
00:58:15 from a logical standpoint,
00:58:17 1,000 cows living mediocre lives
00:58:19 is probably more happiness
00:58:21 overall than one or two cows
00:58:23 living real good lives. But hey,
00:58:25 that's just a theory.
00:58:27 A game theory.
00:58:29 Thanks for watching.
00:58:31 I think from that
00:58:33 sense of logic, I think
00:58:35 we should be making as many people as possible
00:58:37 and making as many cows as possible.
00:58:39 That's the logical application.
00:58:41 You could also say that because all those cows die
00:58:43 and that's sad, that we should have no cows,
00:58:45 we should have no people, we should have absolutely nothing
00:58:47 because then there'll be no sadness in the world,
00:58:49 there'll be no pain, there'll be no death.
00:58:51 I don't see how any of this fits together.
00:58:53 I'm getting really heated right now.
00:58:55 To go back to
00:58:57 my original point
00:58:59 which is what I guess we were trying to talk about
00:59:01 I'm thinking more along the lines of
00:59:03 not enabling happiness
00:59:05 because I don't think there's any way
00:59:07 to guarantee happiness
00:59:09 at least for human beings
00:59:11 that's up to you.
00:59:13 You can only set up potential
00:59:15 for happiness but it's your own actions
00:59:17 in terms of whether you're happy or not.
00:59:19 The kind of philosophy I follow
00:59:21 is about avoiding causing pain
00:59:23 and by that extension
00:59:25 avoiding suffering.
00:59:27 Tom, can I challenge your philosophy
00:59:29 with another question?
00:59:31 Yeah, I'm down to discuss. Go.
00:59:33 So plants and fish
00:59:35 are very similar in that neither feel pain
00:59:37 and you have to kill both of them to eat them
00:59:39 so why do you not eat fish?
00:59:43 I've asked myself that question
00:59:45 I think it's because
00:59:47 that's much more of just
00:59:49 a personal discomfort
00:59:51 because they're still alive and I wouldn't want to deny
00:59:53 something like that. But isn't a plant alive too?
00:59:55 I think it's just that fish
00:59:57 have eyes and we have eyes.
00:59:59 I've thought about that a lot because it's like
01:00:01 by that same philosophy it is still hypocritical
01:00:03 to have plants. You'd have to subsist basically on nothing
01:00:05 by nuts and berries essentially.
01:00:07 Nuts have lives. Nuts have potential for lives.
01:00:09 And as
01:00:11 Sonnet you discovered after he evolved
01:00:13 with his new body, nuts and apples
01:00:15 just won't cut it.
01:00:19 Is that true though? Do fish not feel pain?
01:00:21 How do we know that? I've heard that.
01:00:23 They're not smart enough to feel pain.
01:00:25 I just read it.
01:00:27 Let's just assume that that's true. I'm pretty sure it is.
01:00:29 I've heard it before as well.
01:00:31 It's either a very popular myth or
01:00:33 there's some science somewhere.
01:00:35 Even if we put in a hypothetical animal that's like that though
01:00:37 we could still...
01:00:39 Personally, the fact that fish don't feel pain
01:00:41 say if I was
01:00:43 vegetarian or vegetarian, I would still
01:00:45 not eat fish just because of that emotional
01:00:47 attachment.
01:00:49 Because they have eyes and a mouth and I'm like
01:00:51 it's a guy, it's a person.
01:00:53 I can very easily anthropomorphize a fish.
01:00:55 It's very difficult to anthropomorphize
01:00:57 a plant without making it
01:00:59 an animal with plant-like qualities.
01:01:01 At the end of the day, this philosophy
01:01:03 completely
01:01:05 comes into conflict with
01:01:07 the structure of how life on this planet works.
01:01:09 Sure.
01:01:11 We're all designed to
01:01:13 the entire planet
01:01:15 is basically one
01:01:17 macro-organism where we're all parts of it
01:01:19 and that means we all are interdependent.
01:01:21 You can only resist this to a certain degree
01:01:23 unless you just want to give up yourself and die
01:01:25 and then kind of go back into the soil
01:01:27 and become fuel for something else.
01:01:29 It's inherently flawed.
01:01:31 The ultimate act of vegetarianism is suicide.
01:01:33 It's not even
01:01:35 a joke when you really get
01:01:37 super deep into it.
01:01:39 This is why I don't go out and evangelize it
01:01:41 or try to make a big deal out of it
01:01:43 because to do it is definitely an act of hypocrisy
01:01:45 to a degree
01:01:47 the farther you go down that path.
01:01:49 Tom, it sounds to me
01:01:51 what you're saying is at the logical end
01:01:53 of vegetarianism lies
01:01:55 this rejection
01:01:57 of the systems that keep human beings alive
01:01:59 or allows
01:02:01 that's possibly true
01:02:03 along the vegetarian lifestyle.
01:02:05 I would challenge the vegetarian
01:02:07 ideology at its core
01:02:09 because I think that
01:02:11 and my whole argument at the beginning of this podcast
01:02:13 was a challenge to
01:02:15 why they think the way they do
01:02:17 and why I don't think that it is necessary
01:02:19 to concern ourselves with the lives of animals
01:02:21 at least to the extent that vegetarians do
01:02:23 or vegans or those guys who take it to that extreme.
01:02:25 Living itself
01:02:27 is kind of a selfish thing to do
01:02:29 because to keep yourself alive
01:02:31 you have to consume resources
01:02:33 and if you get a job
01:02:35 it doesn't get that job
01:02:39 it's a bitter struggle for resources
01:02:41 and position and status
01:02:43 and money and sex and all that stuff
01:02:45 and
01:02:47 that's why I really think that
01:02:49 if you don't
01:02:51 to live at all
01:02:53 is to look out for number one
01:02:55 above all else
01:02:57 and if you don't acknowledge that
01:02:59 I really think you're just kidding yourself.
01:03:01 Not to suck my own dick too hard
01:03:03 so I think the only difference between
01:03:05 our two positions here
01:03:07 is that we both accept that living is
01:03:09 a fairly selfish thing to do in general
01:03:11 so we agree on that
01:03:13 but you seem to be
01:03:15 okay at pretty much leaving it at that
01:03:17 whereas I am interested in continuing on
01:03:19 to try to
01:03:21 investigate the ideal situation
01:03:23 where we're causing the least harm possible
01:03:25 that's what I'm interested in from you
01:03:27 I am totally content with leaving it at that
01:03:29 there you go
01:03:31 that was pretty juicy
01:03:33 anybody got any more points to make?
01:03:35 I'll pull them up but anybody got any
01:03:37 more points to make?
01:03:39 I think frogs should take over as the main
01:03:41 species on earth
01:03:43 we have stupid podcasts that suck
01:03:45 and they
01:03:47 they've really shot themselves
01:03:49 in the foot by making those
01:03:51 I think me and Tom
01:03:53 need to go out to dinner and he needs to
01:03:55 prepare me the greatest vegetarian
01:03:57 meal of all time
01:03:59 well then fuck
01:04:01 Tom is good
01:04:03 Tom accepts the vegetarian lifestyle as shit
01:04:05 but he doesn't anyway
01:04:07 I was almost sold
01:04:09 that's the weird thing
01:04:11 I know some good vegetarian things
01:04:13 I like a lot of vegetarian foods
01:04:15 there are good vegetarian meals I'm just a terrible vegetarian
01:04:17 I actually like tofu
01:04:19 you know the thing
01:04:21 you don't even miss for me
01:04:23 I didn't even bring this up at all but I actually
01:04:25 would love to be a vegetarian
01:04:27 for the nutritional benefits
01:04:29 if you're a vegetarian you will
01:04:31 not be fat you just won't be
01:04:33 fat it's not gonna happen
01:04:35 unless you're like a shitty one
01:04:37 no come on
01:04:39 you can eat high fructose
01:04:41 corn syrup as a vegetarian
01:04:43 right yeah I'm revising that
01:04:45 here's the thing you can do for a vegetarian meal
01:04:47 you get a bunch of vegetables
01:04:49 and some olive oil and you put it all in a
01:04:51 pan you just chop it up a bit onions
01:04:53 peppers asparagus all sorts
01:04:55 of things you put them in a pan
01:04:57 and you just roast it you roast that for like
01:04:59 an hour or so and it's just great
01:05:01 no hypocrite sucks roast it there you go
01:05:03 but that just sounds like a side dish
01:05:05 like I'd still be hungry for them
01:05:07 no no it's a big deal because of the olive oil
01:05:09 dude just get a chili and olive oil
01:05:11 and garlic and pepper and all that
01:05:13 haven't you ever had like
01:05:15 haven't you ever had like vegetarian noodles
01:05:17 at like a Chinese place with delicious sauce
01:05:19 it's purely vegetarian but it's fucking delicious
01:05:21 and it's like a big ass entree type meal
01:05:23 I love those those are totally vegetarian
01:05:25 pasta noodle dishes with
01:05:27 vegetables are great
01:05:29 Nate the only food I eat is fried chicken
01:05:31 now you're speaking my language
01:05:33 would you
01:05:35 my snapchat is like
01:05:37 half just like videos of me frying
01:05:39 shit
01:05:41 have you ever like
01:05:43 eaten just the fried part of like
01:05:45 the skin like all the fucking time
01:05:47 I feel that I first need it
01:05:49 yeah maybe that's the only good
01:05:51 bit maybe you should just eat that part
01:05:53 yeah but they don't have extra
01:05:55 yeah I'm a vegetarian I buy
01:05:57 chicken wings and I cook them but I only
01:05:59 eat the skin and I throw the rest to my dogs
01:06:01 yeah
01:06:03 makes perfect sense
01:06:05 I just feel more comfortable that way
01:06:07 okay let's
01:06:09 let's answer some of these questions here
01:06:11 okay here we go
01:06:13 at tbob806
01:06:15 asks how do you guys deal
01:06:17 with stress
01:06:19 is there really any good way
01:06:21 to deal with stress
01:06:23 I don't know it if there is
01:06:25 the main way I deal with stress
01:06:27 is to not worry about people seeing me
01:06:29 get angry because if you worry about
01:06:31 that it's just an extra layer
01:06:33 an extra layer being embarrassed about your feelings
01:06:35 is retarded I know how Gib deals with
01:06:37 stress though Gib goes into
01:06:39 Dark Souls and kills an NPC
01:06:41 that's how he lets off steam
01:06:43 I like that system a lot
01:06:45 my reaction to stress
01:06:47 is to shut down
01:06:49 and go catatonic and not do anything
01:06:51 imagine Ben lying on the floor
01:06:53 emotionless
01:06:55 stress
01:06:57 does it work
01:06:59 no
01:07:01 that's not my coping
01:07:03 that's my natural reaction
01:07:05 it's me sitting at my computer
01:07:07 staring at a screen picking at my hair
01:07:09 just for hours
01:07:11 that's my stress reaction
01:07:13 the best coping mechanism
01:07:15 that I have with it is to
01:07:17 fight through it and do something anyway
01:07:19 and usually that makes me feel better
01:07:21 but of course easier said than done
01:07:23 accomplishing one of the things
01:07:25 on your task list when you're stressed
01:07:27 is I think the best way
01:07:29 it's also the most difficult thing to do
01:07:31 it's really hard
01:07:33 you're least motivated
01:07:35 it's why you need to have a bunch
01:07:37 of shitty projects that don't matter
01:07:39 like I have with the
01:07:41 risker drawings like I'm still doing
01:07:43 if I can't think of anything to do
01:07:45 I do that and I feel okay
01:07:47 if I get to the end of a day and I feel like I haven't accomplished anything
01:07:49 I'll like make a t-shirt
01:07:51 and that will be like
01:07:53 oh I did something today
01:07:57 okay what do we got here
01:07:59 how about at based
01:08:01 anime man says
01:08:03 wait no it's a terrible question never mind
01:08:05 okay here's a better one at our hero
01:08:07 our good friend hgbguy
01:08:09 asks this incredible question
01:08:11 you may only choose one
01:08:13 chicken or tea
01:08:15 that's your question
01:08:17 I'd choose tea by default
01:08:19 I would be really sad to lose
01:08:21 either one
01:08:23 well I can have coffees
01:08:25 who cares tea at chicken
01:08:27 my gut reaction is that
01:08:29 I'd really miss chicken but on the other hand
01:08:31 like other meats are good as well
01:08:33 whereas there's really no good substitute
01:08:35 for tea
01:08:37 Ben do you make chicken nuggets
01:08:39 out of a different animal
01:08:41 actually you make chicken tendis
01:08:43 out of a different animal
01:08:45 can you make buffalo wild wings out of a different animal
01:08:47 I just yesterday watched
01:08:49 a video of
01:08:51 Chef John from foodwishes.com
01:08:53 preparing what he called city chicken
01:08:55 which is just pork arranged
01:08:57 to look like a chicken wing
01:08:59 and supposedly it's pretty good
01:09:03 so maybe I guess I would give up chicken actually
01:09:05 now that you said it
01:09:07 fuck you
01:09:09 I'm kicking you guys out of the chicken nuggets
01:09:11 fan club
01:09:13 I would definitely give up
01:09:15 I like tea but I don't need it
01:09:17 speaking of chicken nuggets you hear about the guy who got
01:09:19 the year of free nuggets from Wendy's
01:09:21 did he get all those tweets
01:09:23 did he get all the retweets
01:09:25 he has the most
01:09:27 he didn't get 18 million but I think it got
01:09:29 like 4 million or something it's the most retweeted
01:09:31 tweet of all time
01:09:33 did he have that agreement
01:09:35 ahead of time or like what was the arrangement
01:09:37 here did he just tweet like hey if I get
01:09:39 a million tweets what he did is he
01:09:41 he tweeted at Wendy's and said how many retweets
01:09:43 do I need to get a year's supply
01:09:45 free nuggets and they responded 18 million
01:09:47 so he quoted that
01:09:49 and said helping to get out I need my nugs
01:09:51 yeah
01:09:53 and he got like 4.5 million tweets and it was the most
01:09:55 retweeted tweet of all time so Wendy's is like
01:09:57 you know what we'll give it to you
01:09:59 that's fucking great that's fantastic
01:10:01 that almost makes up for the porn
01:10:03 the Wendy's porn yeah
01:10:05 yeah
01:10:07 wait I feel like I was gonna say
01:10:09 oh yeah the one misgiving
01:10:11 the one last misgiving I have about giving up chicken
01:10:13 is that chicken breast is like the cheapest
01:10:15 meat like all other meats
01:10:17 are more expensive than chicken
01:10:19 that's what would make me sad about giving up chicken
01:10:21 I feel like a lot of the time
01:10:23 fried chicken it's mostly
01:10:25 in the batter and I can do it
01:10:27 with other meat
01:10:29 I probably could
01:10:31 nothing beats chicken nuggets
01:10:33 with buffalo sauce baby
01:10:35 you can't beat it
01:10:37 some of that honey mustard
01:10:39 sauce
01:10:41 you gotta give up tea
01:10:43 who gives a fuck about tea
01:10:45 yeah
01:10:47 I drink tea every day
01:10:49 and even I know chicken
01:10:51 I mean how are you gonna bulk without chicken
01:10:53 come on
01:10:55 I enjoy chicken more often than I enjoy tea
01:10:57 I should give up the tea
01:10:59 it's better than tea
01:11:01 I like it
01:11:03 but I've already done this in giving up chicken
01:11:05 that's true
01:11:07 there's so many different kinds of tea
01:11:09 so many different kinds of chicken
01:11:11 I think
01:11:13 I could probably
01:11:15 if I wanted to give up meat entirely
01:11:17 it wasn't that hard
01:11:19 I did it in one day
01:11:21 Jesus Christ
01:11:23 how long have you been a veg man
01:11:25 I think seven years now
01:11:27 seven years
01:11:29 now Tom this is an important question
01:11:31 I forgot to ask
01:11:33 as a vegetarian do you still eat pussy
01:11:35 you know
01:11:37 that is my one flaw
01:11:39 I suppose
01:11:41 on the rare occasions I'm allowed
01:11:43 you hypocrite
01:11:45 okay here's another question
01:11:47 hey guys do you think
01:11:49 vegetarian women still swallow cum
01:11:51 yes
01:11:53 better
01:11:55 if a cow could talk
01:11:57 and would say like
01:11:59 take my milk go for it no problem
01:12:01 swallow my cum dude
01:12:03 swallow my cum
01:12:05 okay here we go
01:12:07 at Gergerad
01:12:09 says what is the ideal
01:12:11 breakfast of champions
01:12:13 especially excited to hear a hypocrite
01:12:15 and his take on English breakfast
01:12:17 also his name is toasty boy
01:12:19 is the breakfast of champions
01:12:21 in reference to anything
01:12:23 what's your favorite breakfast
01:12:25 that was the slogan for weedies for a while
01:12:27 right that's true
01:12:29 weedies is not involved in my breakfast of champions
01:12:31 I occasionally have
01:12:33 an English breakfast
01:12:35 with tomatoes
01:12:37 and mushrooms
01:12:39 and toast and bacon
01:12:41 I'm into that
01:12:43 it's all nice and greasy and cool
01:12:45 but I don't have it every day
01:12:47 because it's a lot of stuff to do
01:12:49 but yeah
01:12:51 English breakfast is my favorite
01:12:53 I don't know if
01:12:55 yeah English breakfast is good
01:12:57 every breakfast you eat is an English breakfast
01:12:59 I don't know if this is the best
01:13:01 well, Nate
01:13:03 I have two breakfast stories
01:13:05 one is
01:13:07 we went one year to like
01:13:09 Connecticut or something and we stayed at this
01:13:11 weirdly fancy hotel
01:13:13 we were in this hotel that was
01:13:15 really fancy for some reason
01:13:17 I think I do remember that
01:13:19 yeah
01:13:21 and there was like a big like painted mural
01:13:23 on the ceiling of the foyer or whatever
01:13:25 anyway it was advertised
01:13:27 that there was free breakfast
01:13:29 like free continental breakfast meaning like
01:13:31 some fucking danishes and coffee
01:13:33 and like a little like sealed
01:13:35 pouch of cereal or whatever
01:13:37 but I went to like this other room by accident
01:13:39 it was like a restaurant in the thing
01:13:41 and I ordered Lobster Eggs
01:13:43 Benedict thinking that
01:13:45 I remember that
01:13:47 thinking that this was the free breakfast
01:13:49 and they gave it to me
01:13:51 and then they were like yeah $35
01:13:53 I was like I'm just a kid
01:13:55 I don't have any money
01:13:57 and then like I don't know
01:13:59 I went and got mom or something
01:14:01 and like she was like
01:14:03 I think they gave it to me for free
01:14:05 because like I was a kid
01:14:07 so that was one of the best breakfast I ever had
01:14:09 the other one, okay the other day
01:14:11 a couple days before I left Digi House
01:14:13 we went out to Waffle House together
01:14:15 and Waffle House is kind of
01:14:17 is kind of pricey for what it is
01:14:19 like the food's not great
01:14:21 it's kind of shitty and it's not that cheap
01:14:23 but you can like
01:14:25 hash browns are like $1.75
01:14:27 and a triple serving of hash browns
01:14:29 is like less than three times
01:14:31 it's like $3 and you can get a topping
01:14:33 for like 50 cents a piece
01:14:35 and one of the toppings is sausage gravy
01:14:37 so go to Waffle House
01:14:39 get a triple hash browns
01:14:41 with sausage gravy and it is a huge
01:14:43 fucking bowl of hash brown
01:14:45 smothered in like
01:14:47 ladles full of sausage gravy
01:14:49 I was stuffed and it cost me like $3.75
01:14:51 that sounds amazing
01:14:53 it was amazing
01:14:55 everyone try it
01:14:57 that sounds pretty good
01:14:59 go and rip off your local Waffle House
01:15:01 by the way I fucking love sausage gravy
01:15:03 and I hate that they don't eat it
01:15:05 above the Mason Dixon line
01:15:07 yeah we do
01:15:09 I like never had it
01:15:11 in life until I was like an adult
01:15:13 we grew up in fucking Massachusetts
01:15:15 every gas station would have
01:15:17 biscuits and gravy available
01:15:19 to eat and they had sausage gravy
01:15:21 they don't have it around Boston
01:15:23 yeah biscuits and gravy was not a thing
01:15:25 around Boston
01:15:27 you could get it at KFC
01:15:29 but not like sausage gravy
01:15:31 it was like shitty
01:15:33 I remembered my actual
01:15:35 favorite breakfast I ever had
01:15:37 it sounds weird but it's
01:15:39 cold salmon
01:15:41 like cold salmon fish
01:15:43 with
01:15:45 scrambled eggs
01:15:47 but put in the microwave
01:15:49 it's very strange
01:15:51 but it's really nice
01:15:53 like cold salmon and hot
01:15:55 microwaved scrambled eggs
01:15:57 delicious if you have that
01:15:59 that reminds me of another breakfast favor
01:16:01 but it also worked good for brunch or lunch
01:16:03 which is a bagel with cream cheese
01:16:05 capers, onions, tomato slices
01:16:07 and thin sliced smoked salmon
01:16:11 or the locks bagel
01:16:13 is one of my other favorite breakfast
01:16:15 but you gotta have the capers
01:16:17 the capers really make the meal
01:16:19 trust me
01:16:21 I wanna hear what you guys think of this one
01:16:23 for the breakfast of a true champion
01:16:25 you sleep until noon
01:16:27 and then you eat lunch
01:16:29 I got breakfast of champions
01:16:31 I was gonna say I don't have breakfast
01:16:33 I intermittent fast but I also sleep all day
01:16:35 regardless of when I wake up
01:16:37 wait that's not the dietary intermittent fasting
01:16:39 of like the professional bodybuilders
01:16:41 that's not what you're talking about
01:16:43 I eat for an 8 hour period
01:16:45 I fast for 16 on the daily
01:16:47 and do you do this for like
01:16:49 the weight loss?
01:16:51 that's how I heard about it
01:16:53 but I just do it because
01:16:55 like fuck why not it's easy
01:16:57 I kinda do the same thing where
01:16:59 I'll eat for 16 hours and then for 8 hours
01:17:01 I won't
01:17:03 you talk about 18 hours
01:17:05 16 hours straight
01:17:07 like that's a big meal
01:17:09 no no just like you know every now and then
01:17:11 like sometimes they eat breakfast and lunch and dinner
01:17:13 like these random little meals throughout the day
01:17:15 and then 8 hours no eating at all
01:17:17 I don't understand what you're talking about
01:17:19 he's saying that he eats throughout the day
01:17:21 and then goes to sleep
01:17:23 I fast when I'm asleep
01:17:25 it's a fucking joke
01:17:27 Tyrone likes to pyramid his meals
01:17:29 meaning each meal is bigger than the last
01:17:31 I met Tyrone's dad the other day
01:17:33 he was a short Mexican guy
01:17:35 Tyrone's 6 foot 10 and 300 pounds
01:17:37 what?
01:17:39 that's some donkey
01:17:41 here's a question
01:17:43 at Vivian Flamer
01:17:45 at Vivian Flamer asks
01:17:47 will you validate me by answering my humorous question
01:17:49 that leaves little room for discussion
01:17:51 towards the end of your podcast please
01:17:53 no moving on
01:17:55 next question
01:17:57 at anime
01:17:59 people have weird names
01:18:01 maybe it is
01:18:03 oh yeah that's probably it
01:18:05 oh you got it good job
01:18:07 have you ever had any paranormal
01:18:09 or otherwise inexplicable
01:18:11 experiences
01:18:13 yes ghost
01:18:15 ghost I am a ghost
01:18:17 yeah you ever had a paranormal
01:18:19 thing happen to you
01:18:21 or just inexplicable
01:18:23 I went to Pokemon hell
01:18:25 how was it
01:18:27 it was hot
01:18:29 I left
01:18:31 it hurts a lot
01:18:33 trust me
01:18:35 I had a ghost
01:18:37 I had a ghost
01:18:39 so my college
01:18:41 was real gay
01:18:43 I guess it was
01:18:45 the most haunted college
01:18:47 in New Jersey
01:18:49 it had some shitty little claim to fame
01:18:51 there were a couple of local ghosts
01:18:53 in different buildings
01:18:55 when I
01:18:57 first got there as a freshman
01:18:59 they had a thing
01:19:01 there was like a raffle
01:19:03 to see who got to go on this ghost
01:19:05 tour
01:19:07 where a tour guide would go around and talk about the ghost
01:19:09 and like oh my god this is a fucking
01:19:11 tale
01:19:13 we went around to different places
01:19:15 oh this is the ghost that supposedly he is here
01:19:17 and we went up to the top of this
01:19:19 administrative building
01:19:21 that is not a normal place
01:19:23 to go
01:19:25 and we were standing up in this kind of
01:19:27 conference room with windows
01:19:29 and
01:19:31 he is talking about the ghost
01:19:33 he is talking about a ghost of a woman
01:19:35 who died
01:19:37 and there is a lightning flash
01:19:39 someone takes a picture in a camera
01:19:41 and I swear to god
01:19:43 reflected in the window in this room
01:19:45 I see the image
01:19:47 of an old man in a poncho
01:19:49 standing next to a little boy
01:19:51 that looks an awful lot like a ghost
01:19:53 and I was like hey excuse me
01:19:55 I just saw a ghost in the mirror
01:19:57 I saw the ghostly image of an old man
01:19:59 in a poncho standing with a little boy
01:20:01 and he was like oh no that is not the ghost that lives here
01:20:03 and I was okay never mind don't worry about it
01:20:05 it is fine
01:20:07 and then
01:20:09 some fucking goth chick
01:20:11 was like uh
01:20:13 got all spooked and she was sitting on a radiator
01:20:15 and she was like uh and she kind of made a scene
01:20:17 about it and the tour guide was like
01:20:19 it is and she was like oh I felt something
01:20:21 but you know I'm very receptive to the spirits
01:20:23 you know I talk to ghosts
01:20:25 I talk to ghosts all the time
01:20:27 and then yeah and then she went on this big stupid thing
01:20:29 about her retarded beliefs or whatever
01:20:31 was it not because she sat on a hot radion
01:20:33 she went ah
01:20:35 she fucking she faked the whole
01:20:37 goddamn thing for attention
01:20:39 that son of a bitch
01:20:41 I need to ask so how
01:20:43 convinced are you that what you experienced there was a
01:20:45 paranormal event
01:20:47 20%
01:20:49 okay that is what I wanted to hear
01:20:51 I had a real one
01:20:53 if you want to hear my real paranormal event
01:20:55 sure sure sure
01:20:57 so one time me and my buddies we went to
01:20:59 Red Lobster and you know like they
01:21:01 for some reason in all these fucking places
01:21:03 you know Yorda Crab Legs or Lobster
01:21:05 they don't take the meat out for you
01:21:07 they are like here here is a $25
01:21:09 shore for you have fun
01:21:11 so I got all the meat out of my Lobster
01:21:13 and I had this shell sitting over there
01:21:15 and I found a bit and I think
01:21:17 there was a ghost in the shell
01:21:19 wow
01:21:21 fuck all of you
01:21:23 rap events gay bullshit
01:21:25 and not my hilarious meme
01:21:27 you just put the words
01:21:29 of a thing that everyone knows
01:21:31 it was just it was all just a shaggy dog
01:21:33 story
01:21:37 I'm starting my new podcast
01:21:39 I'm starting the pro labs and gators
01:21:41 podcast
01:21:43 there's a question that's not purely
01:21:45 this is a purely a vanity question
01:21:47 a facu
01:21:49 at facacababaca
01:21:51 god damn it
01:21:53 I don't know whatever
01:21:55 facucabobaca asks how do you like your steak
01:21:57 and I'm only answering this because I just had
01:21:59 the best steak in my whole life two weeks ago
01:22:01 at this rip my parents came to visit in Cincinnati
01:22:03 and we went to this place called the precinct
01:22:05 for the first time in my life they want to go to a fancy restaurant
01:22:07 so I got this
01:22:09 reservation at the place I never believed
01:22:11 There was such a thing as a good restaurant. I assumed everything was McDonald's quality or worse
01:22:16 And I got to this place and we had this it's famous for its steaks like a Cincinnati famous restaurant and
01:22:23 Had the fucking steak and it was just the literally the best meal I've ever had in my entire life
01:22:28 And it was I believe
01:22:30 Medium no it was medium rare. Yeah, it was me. I think medium rare is the way to go with stay
01:22:37 It was it was pink and juicy and so fucking succulent. Yeah, everyone go to the precinct
01:22:44 It's not a steak, but I just went to a place called Moxie burger yesterday
01:22:48 Which I'd never been to before and ordered the classic Moxie burger, which is it's a burger medium rare with bacon
01:22:56 like a cheese sauce some other like spicy aioli sauce on it or something and a fried green tomato and
01:23:03 I'd never had a fried green tomato before it kind of tastes like a pickle. Anyway, it was super good and
01:23:09 Medium rare medium medium rare is the point. Oh, I just I just thought of a cool thing to say. There's a good be a hashtag
01:23:17 Liking well done steak is the equivalent of liking Dark Souls 2
01:23:22 That's a comparison. I thought it's quite apt because people people garbage. Yeah, no people
01:23:29 It's mostly because people have come out and said, you know, I think well done steak is the best and I'm like, well
01:23:36 It isn't you just like it
01:23:38 So you're you're dumb. I
01:23:41 Agreed. Okay. Here we go. He decky camea said that as a boy
01:23:45 He would eat steak but his but he would eat American steak only he couldn't understand all the words like he couldn't fully
01:23:51 Appreciate the taste of the American steak which inspired him which inspired him to make his own steak as an adult and like
01:23:58 Deliberately leave out some of like the key ingredients so that the so that the player of the steak had to like piece the story together in their own minds
01:24:05 But you said he decky camea. What you mean is he did talking me is a I'm fucking
01:24:10 I was quite lost there. Yeah, fuck me now. Sorry. That's his first name. Whatever. Who cares to me is a key
01:24:15 Okay, here's a here's another question. Okay, this is a this is one
01:24:18 I've been mulling over in my mind for a long time at Mostafa was here asks. Is it gay to fap with friends? Yes
01:24:28 I'm not prepared to condemn it to gay. All right quick get out of here. You fucking there are situations
01:24:34 How do you mean there are situations?
01:24:36 If you're back-to-back if you're back-to-back
01:24:38 If you're back-to-back, it's not gay, dude
01:24:40 No, they're not gay
01:24:42 But why?
01:24:43 If you're not gay, you're still a fag
01:24:45 Just go to the fucking next door
01:24:48 Well, just go home
01:24:50 Would you be like would you be like like like two of you like backed into it like like back-to-back like fighting off waves of zombies like jizzing all over them
01:24:57 Right
01:24:59 That would yeah, that'd be okay. Look there was this this isn't this isn't actually like the full fap story
01:25:05 But it's like when I was a little boy
01:25:07 My friend showed me
01:25:09 Some hardcore you're gay you guys you guys all know a heatherbrook right though the famous deep-throat artist
01:25:15 She's a goddess
01:25:16 And and she was my friends showed me that and I didn't jack off with them
01:25:22 But I went to the next room and I jacked off and I just feel totally
01:25:26 Vindicated for that that whole event and I don't feel there was a shred of gayness in the whole thing
01:25:30 If anyone is gay, it's them for giving me a boner
01:25:33 That's gay to bring up a porn when around your friends one time as a youth
01:25:39 Me and a friend like like went to the bathroom
01:25:42 And I like was peeing in the urinal and I finished and then for some reason I decided to like jerk off into the urinal
01:25:50 Yeah, and like I was a little kid and like I don't know I like I thought it was cool
01:25:54 I was like hey, hey, I'm jerking off. He's like are you jerking off? I was like, yeah, I am
01:26:00 But you know what unlike Nate, I'm gonna get I was fucking gay and weird
01:26:07 One time at summer camp a dude just pulled out his dick and showed it to me and said like dude, isn't this sick
01:26:13 Is it I'm gonna be sick
01:26:19 Are you a doctor by any chance
01:26:25 We live in a mad world we live in a mad world a world of possibilities
01:26:30 Personally, I don't think we're gay
01:26:31 I don't think there's anything gay with a jerk in your dick while looking at a woman if your friends next to you fuck it
01:26:37 I got to agree on that
01:26:39 Jerking off to a woman is gay then you need to be a value in your own sexuality
01:26:43 Why do you got to do it with your buddy?
01:26:45 Watching the same porno dude. That's weird, too
01:26:51 The thing about is that the the the proximity of the dicks and the the awareness of both of you that there's some
01:26:56 There's a there's a live dick somewhere right next to you
01:26:59 What if we're both on our blind side it if you glance at it if you think about it then you're gay
01:27:03 No, what if I don't examine well if you're at a separate like it's I mean we're the same blanket
01:27:08 That's kind of just being gay with each other
01:27:10 I mean
01:27:12 What is wrong with all of you think about the historical context Tom come on like
01:27:21 If you're double-teaming a girl that's basically like masturbating only using a girl as a masturbation to tool
01:27:27 Right there
01:27:41 That's funny term, okay, but but also consider even more apropos is the old like nudie picture
01:27:50 Cinemas they used to have where everyone would go in and and fucking pee-wee Herman went and jerked off
01:27:55 That's a bunch of strangers, and I assume they're not like next to each other
01:27:59 I assume they're all like seated in they have a little cubicle like like that the people at the top jizz on the people on the lowest
01:28:06 That's called that's called trickle down economics
01:28:13 What if there's somebody at home who lives in a poor family, and they have to share a bedroom with like their brother
01:28:18 Are they allowed to jerk off are their brothers in the room? You know yes desperate times call for stealth situations
01:28:24 Yeah
01:28:27 Stealth jerking off is different
01:28:30 Totally different we've all
01:28:37 Okay, okay, yeah stealth I mean I mean I'm I'm imagining like you both got your dicks out like right conscious, and you're both like yeah
01:28:44 We're jack you're the gay one if your mind went straight to that
01:28:52 That that's that's why I brought up like the whole like awareness thing like do they know that I'm doing it or
01:28:57 Do I know that they're doing it if both of you know that the other is doing it, then it's pretty gay
01:29:02 Disagree what I'm not looking at his dick. I'm looking at the tits on the TV. Okay, you know what?
01:29:10 But it's stupid I wouldn't do it. I would feel let me ask you this is it gay to sword fight with your dicks is that no no
01:29:20 I think it depends on how you do it
01:29:23 It's only gay if your intention is to come from it. Yeah, I sort of agree. I sort of agree
01:29:29 Yeah, I guess
01:29:31 It's okay
01:29:33 Just like cuz if a guy grabs your junk it just starts groping you like you may in fact get a boner despite being totally
01:29:39 Heterosexual just from the physical stimulation to the same in the same way
01:29:43 Getting a boner in order to sword fight with a dude is totally not necessarily gay
01:29:48 But if the act excites you and the rubbing of the dicks against each other if that excites you that's gay
01:29:53 And just why touching it has to be
01:29:59 Maybe it maybe I said it right Ben I got a question for you physical stimulation is is is not gay then
01:30:06 Then physical stimulation of two dicks
01:30:09 Is
01:30:11 It's not gay if it feels good guys
01:30:16 Then I've got a test for you. Let's say your girlfriend wants to surprise you she says here Ben
01:30:21 I'm gonna blindfold you give you a blow job. Yeah, she does. Oh, it wasn't her
01:30:25 She had her brother do it
01:30:28 And you think it was a chick are you now gay? Well, yes for sure
01:30:37 Although I am although I am single now because my girlfriend is the intention is dead now
01:30:44 The whole thing about about sexual orientation is that it's a preference if it's if you don't know that it's a guy
01:30:51 Then it's fine. Yeah, so you just wear a blindfold all the time. You know as much and then sword fight all you want
01:30:59 Okay, we we plumbed the depth. I feel like we've learned a lot today
01:31:04 You guys are one piece experts has Luffy ever stretched out his dick like a sword and sword fight it
01:31:09 It has well he hasn't done that. Yes. Well. Yeah, but there's that one though. There was that one chapter where there's those
01:31:17 Yeah, that's right. Yeah, get get ready for this. What happened was stretched it. Yeah, I think they start the scene
01:31:24 All right now listen to this listen
01:31:25 So so Luffy once crash landed on an island of only women
01:31:28 He was found you know, he was hurt really bad a bunch of women found him unconscious
01:31:32 They brought him to a bath and they started bathing and they took off all his clothes and they were like oh my god
01:31:36 He's he's got like a mushroom attached to we got to pull this off
01:31:38 There was literally chapters of this girl. I forget her name Marianne or something stretch trying stretching his dick
01:31:45 Oh, it's so stretchy. Why wouldn't it come off trying to separate his dick from his body?
01:31:48 He's getting jacked off in canon one piece
01:31:56 And they do it because they don't know what a man is yeah, I don't know
01:32:00 Okay, it's pretty hot though. Nonetheless. It's pretty great. Now if it was a bunch of Amazon men would Luffy be gay. Yes
01:32:08 Not from that but because he was unconscious, but then when he woke up he would become gay immediately
01:32:15 Aware what awareness of sexual acts with men is what makes you guys. This is way more fun than animal rights
01:32:21 We should do a whole episode. What is gay? This is way more fun. Oh my god. What is gay is a great
01:32:26 Let's come back. Did you already did that on our social media podcast you faggot?
01:32:38 It was already decided that it's only gay if the balls touch that that's a pretty good rule one theory
01:32:45 We got alternative theories
01:32:48 What about what about if one of your balls touches your other ball is that gay? That's definitely
01:32:54 Yeah, gay gay. I'm gay right now
01:32:58 There's not a man alive who's not gay is
01:33:01 Nobody's gay. Oh
01:33:04 Here's our last question
01:33:06 At at pancake monster asks or at pancake monstay because I guess they couldn't fit the R
01:33:11 What PCP member would be the easiest to kidnap? I'm gonna say Ben St. I will email his address to you
01:33:23 I mean Ben St. Is just like ET only instead of Reese's pieces just take garbage and he'll follow and need it
01:33:32 Ben will that's true. Ben is Ben is very predictable. He's very weak-minded. He is very susceptible to suggestion and trickery
01:33:41 I don't think you'll have this trouble
01:33:45 I'm just like a deer in the headlights all the time
