00:00:00 Okay, okay, I'm, I'm, I'm, okay, I'm my audio.
00:00:03 Finally. I'm an audio guy.
00:00:05 Finally, God.
00:00:07 Jesus Christ.
00:00:09 Damn.
00:00:10 You're so dead. You're fucking dead.
00:00:12 Oh no. Oh no.
00:00:15 Fuck.
00:00:17 I'm fucked.
00:00:19 Dude.
00:00:21 I can't believe. I can't believe.
00:00:24 What, what a treat.
00:00:26 What a, what a treat to discover that you have not played frog fractions.
00:00:32 What, what a fucking joke.
00:00:35 What a joke of a person you are.
00:00:40 Oh man. I can't wait for the right fucking cockroaches to evolve into a civil war.
00:00:46 Where I just, it's not even gonna be a war.
00:00:49 I'm just gonna go to sleep and I'm gonna pour gasoline inside of your fucking room.
00:00:53 And just wait until you suffocate on gasoline.
00:00:58 Just, yeah, like, like everyone in RFCK will have to, will have to choose their side.
00:01:05 It will be, will be split right down the middle. Yes, Suri.
00:01:11 A group of rowdy fuckers and a group of cop killers cannot be divided.
00:01:20 It was, it was rowdy fucker against cop killer.
00:01:27 Oh, who would it be who? Oh, it's too difficult.
00:01:30 There's no way, there's no way.
00:01:32 I think I'm the cop killer.
00:01:35 Oh, you do, huh? You fucking, you fucking establishment piece of shit.
00:01:41 You think you're the cop killer? I've been killing cops since I was a penis, bitch.
00:01:45 My mother was a cop and she died in childbirth.
00:01:51 Oh, fuck. All right.
00:01:53 And when my mom died in childbirth, my dad gave me a little baby high five.
00:02:01 All right, preview stream.
00:02:04 Fuck. Okay, okay, okay, here's the million dollar question.
00:02:08 Because I have to like record like a sub region in OBS, right?
00:02:11 So it's like, it's like small. Should I keep it at its original size?
00:02:14 You can like inflate it.
00:02:16 Wait, you can record your whole screen. Isn't there a monitor setting?
00:02:19 Well, sure. But wouldn't I just want to record the bit that is actually relevant?
00:02:25 I guess. I don't know. I've never, I've never done that.
00:02:30 You can just, you can just record the window.
00:02:33 Yeah, yeah, I'll do that.
00:02:35 But you think you're so smart.
00:02:37 I'm pretty clever.
00:02:43 Yeah, you know, you're right. You've convinced me.
00:02:46 Thanks.
00:02:48 Okay, thanks for taking me at my word.
00:02:51 Yeah.
00:02:53 All right.
00:02:55 Okay. Okay, so do we go?
00:02:57 Hang on. Let me, um,
00:03:01 No, I don't want to see. All right. So I'm looking at your screen.
00:03:07 If I'm reading this, I'm gay. Yep. That's me.
00:03:10 Yep.
00:03:12 You're paid off.
00:03:14 I just fell for the trap. Okay.
00:03:19 Yep. I guess we can go if you want to, if you want to head over to, if you want to head over to, I'm going to be, I'm going to be,
00:03:26 I'm going to start the video recording.
00:03:28 I'm going to, I'm going to help. Okay. I'm going to be a very helpful boy.
00:03:32 Okay. Okay. Okay.
00:03:34 When you're recording on your frog on your quest to learn fractions with a frog.
00:03:39 Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm recording. I'm recording the screen capture and I'm singing up the audio now when I, on the count of three, I'm going to open a new tab.
00:03:47 So one, two, three, new tab. All right. One, two, three, new tab. All right. Sick.
00:03:52 I don't see anything.
00:03:54 No, that's fine. It's because it's not, it's not on the fucking.
00:03:58 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We got this.
00:04:00 We got to sync audio too.
00:04:02 Oh yeah. Okay. Well, I, hold on. This like, this like screen you're seeing isn't my screen. It's like its own thing and like the cloud.
00:04:11 Okay. Okay. On the count of three, we'll say peg. All right. One, two, three, peg.
00:04:19 All right. Great job.
00:04:21 Yep.
00:04:22 One, two, three, peg. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's set in the mood. It's a tone piece.
00:04:27 RFCK is a tone piece now.
00:04:30 That was completely not right on my screen, but if it's good on your screen, then I guess we'll do it.
00:04:35 I don't see anything on your screen.
00:04:38 No. Well, I meant, I meant as in, we didn't sync up audio wise.
00:04:42 Also, I'm not, okay, whatever. I'm not recording anything.
00:04:48 You aren't?
00:04:49 I'm recording audio. I'm not recording video.
00:04:51 No. Yeah. Obviously. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:04:56 As long as we've synced up audio wise, then we're good.
00:04:58 But are you, are you sure you're recording your video though? You're sure?
00:05:02 Well, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Why would, yeah, why would it yeah?
00:05:05 I don't know. I don't know.
00:05:06 I don't even doubt myself. You fucking nihilist.
00:05:12 I don't believe in videos and therefore they never exist.
00:05:16 Hold on. Before we go to FrogFactions, I'm gonna have like a joke.
00:05:20 should introduce when... Hold on. Okay. Hold on. What the fuck is this? Pictures of a big
00:05:29 baby. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Introduce the podcast. Okay. Yeah, why not? Hey, welcome
00:05:43 back to the long-awaited Return Resurrection Reimagining Reboot of
00:05:49 Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers Episode 4. Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers. I think we've had way
00:05:55 more. I think we've had like at least like more than one. At least one.
00:06:02 There's at least one, and this is at least one and a half. Starring me. Starring me,
00:06:07 your hero, Ben St. and my bumbling sidekick, Munchy, with tiny heads. That's so funny.
00:06:13 It's so funny that you guys walked in just a moment while I was looking at
00:06:16 pictures of Ben to put in my collection. What are you? The pictures of Ben on the
00:06:21 screen right now. It's fucking crazy. Those babies are like 17 different
00:06:25 ethnicities, and I am only one, so... Oh, oh, oh. Checkmate. Checkmate. When I say that
00:06:32 you are you're a melting pot of cultures. I do believe, yeah, I'm all about
00:06:39 representation, dude. Even in my gene pool. Even in my very DNA. I know when I
00:06:46 think about Ben St. I think about Big Baby, Villains Wiki from Toy Story 3. It's
00:06:51 what I think about. Villains Wiki. That fucking baby was just misunderstood. God
00:06:56 damn it. Didn't he watch the movie? He just wanted to kill all Pokemon. He just
00:07:02 was mad because he was a mechanical spider now. Right. Tell the bitches. Oh my
00:07:10 god. So the other day I asked Munchy, surely you've played Frog Fractions,
00:07:16 and the greatest moment of my entire life was when he said,
00:07:21 Duh, Duh, no. What's that? Duh. Okay. Well, okay. First of all, I did say... We're
00:07:30 fixing that on Rowdyfuckers cop killers. We're recording. Boot up discord. I did say,
00:07:35 I did say it as if I had three, three, like an IQ in the single digits. However, I said
00:07:43 that I played like the first like three seconds, and then I was like eh. Yeah. That's why I
00:07:48 basically haven't seen any of it. Yeah, okay. Frog Fractions twin beard. What do you know
00:07:52 about Frog? What do you know about Frog Fractions Munchy? Okay. I know that Nate was like,
00:07:57 Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh. Yeah. That is, that is so something he'd say.
00:08:08 And then I was like, okay, and then then then we were in a call to record the PCP and it was like,
00:08:13 I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure that Nate's a pretty I'm sure I'm sure that Nate thinks he loves frog fractions
00:08:22 But I'm sure but I'm sure that his appreciation is like is like is like a fucking kiddie pool
00:08:28 Compared to the vast ocean of wisdom that is my engagement with frog fractions
00:08:35 If you fucking like frog so much why don't you rub one?
00:08:40 Anyway, oh shit, he did I didn't expect that let's let's just fuck this duck shall we oh
00:08:48 That's what I've always what the fuck is this shit. Oh here. Ow my brain. That's pretty that's pretty loud
00:08:55 That's pretty that is pretty loud. It's pretty fucking loud. I'm gonna. Oh god. Wait turn I
00:09:02 Turn I turn volume down. I I guess I'll I'll turn mine down too
00:09:10 I'll cut this cut this part out of the podcast. Oh shit. Should I be recording the sound too? I should yeah, yeah, you should
00:09:19 Okay frog fractions
00:09:22 Are you recording the sound? Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay sweet
00:09:28 Excellent, okay
00:09:31 All right frog fractions. We're gonna play all right month the kids
00:09:36 Know how we are. I know that you are in like fourth grade or something
00:09:43 So you I know you probably you probably don't even know simple you probably don't even know simple fucking
00:09:51 You probably don't even know the fucking chain rule for integration let alone fractions
00:09:57 But you're about to and when this frog is done with you you're gonna know
00:10:03 Everything about parts of things please please save me save me for this trap that I've laid for myself
00:10:11 Munchie and in the third grade the teacher came with me and said all right
00:10:15 We're gonna be learning about division and I and I sneezed and I feel like a huge fucking booger came out of my nose
00:10:20 And like it was all over my desk and all the kids laughed at me
00:10:23 I
00:10:27 Faggot it was hot. Yeah
00:10:30 Play frog fractions. Okay, so okay, so I like I want to get so now the learning
00:10:36 But you want to eat the bugs?
00:10:37 Frogs eat bugs and you want to protect the fruits you want to protect the fruit. Oh, why?
00:10:42 Frogs where are the fruits ever do for fucking me? I forget I forget what they do
00:10:47 But what see see you one fell on you. I think you want to
00:10:52 You might want to eat the fruits when they when they fall. I don't know
00:10:56 I mean the ones that are like on top of you just fall right on top this website. We're using to do this fucking sucks
00:11:02 I have huge input delay. That's not even fair
00:11:04 Really, that's fine. Yeah, no, you're gonna be fine. Um, okay
00:11:09 Yeah, so you got to get upgrades you got to upgrade so you can really learn about fractions like in a really efficient alright
00:11:17 Uh
00:11:18 Don't give us don't get the cybernetic brain get the what's the top left one there?
00:11:23 No left
00:11:25 Yeah, yeah, you want lock-on targeting?
00:11:27 Okay, so so so this game is like made for like for like shitty idiot babies, right?
00:11:32 Yeah, yeah, if you're a little kid and you don't know about fractions then this is the game for you
00:11:36 Anyway, it seems like it's not teaching me. It's just showing fractions on screen. Yeah
00:11:41 Well, I mean you gotta you gotta start by dipping your toe in just with the introduction
00:11:45 Just you know, they just get introduced the concept that fractions are a thing that exists
00:11:50 And you can you can see at the top there. It's tracking. Oh, fuck. I got two. It's tracking your fruit
00:11:54 It's tracking your indignity and it's tracking your Zork
00:12:00 Zork mids are gonna Zork mids are gonna be important later right now. Okay, just worry about fruit and indignity
00:12:06 No, I'm pretty I'm pretty honorable. I think I think this is fuck
00:12:09 I think you I think you gain indignity when the bugs like hit you or something like it like
00:12:14 You know like they make you mad and that's how you lose
00:12:17 Fuck I want I want a turtle fuck. Yeah. Oh, dude. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can was so now you can catch
00:12:23 You know you can catch the apples you can catch the fruits when they fall on you
00:12:27 All right, so that's like I can go. That's like sick. That's like sick, bro
00:12:31 Oh, yeah, this is totally sick. Okay, so I can go right like I can go up
00:12:35 Yeah, you go up and yeah, hit your buttons stupid. I'm going. I'm going. I'm hidden down
00:12:40 It won't it won't fucking do it. What wait go left and right. Oh
00:12:46 It won't do that also either, but it just did I just saw you move. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm doing it right now
00:12:52 Ben, I'm doing it right now. What that's weird. That's I just saw you move. I
00:12:58 Start working now for some reason
00:13:01 What okay, okay, finish this round finish this round. Okay. Oh, you fucking you yeah, I see you fucking click click the screen click the screen
00:13:10 Okay, now move I can't are you fucking are you fucking serious?
00:13:16 Seriously so mad. Oh that makes me so goddamn angry, dude. I'm angry at you. I'm angry at you
00:13:24 Okay, okay, this is fine. Okay. Yeah dirt. Yeah, you get the durians are the king of fruits
00:13:31 Wait is was working
00:13:33 No, this is fucked. This is fucked. We can't fucking continue. We honestly cannot continue without without was functionality
00:13:44 Dude, you don't eat the your fucking window doesn't have
00:13:48 focus
00:13:49 Are you okay try the arrow keys to the arrow keys work?
00:13:53 No, the arrow keys are the ones that are making me go up and down like like my like page
00:13:58 Maybe we should have tried this before
00:14:05 This shit, this is fucking gay dude. This is fucking gay. All right, hold on hold on hold on
00:14:14 How it just worked yeah, it really did just work for like like a fucking second, but I don't know why it's
00:14:22 I
00:14:25 Nothing I can fucking do
00:14:28 It like like it was working up until I like try to do up or down and then just wouldn't I'm
00:14:35 I'm like tempted to say like fucking like restart the the really restart reload the page
00:14:41 Yeah, I'm done with that. Okay. Yeah
00:14:44 All right, welcome to the second attempt. Yeah
00:14:52 Fucking fucking twin beard fucking twin beard can't program for shit apparently
00:14:57 Whatever, you know, it's fine. You've you've learned the ropes. You're learning the ropes. You'll figure it out
00:15:04 You see you already got 16 Zork mids. You're off. Yeah, I got a ton of fucking Zork mids
00:15:09 When the ladies come to me say yo, how many Zork mids you guys say I'm fucking I can't talk to you your different race
00:15:16 You say I say 16. That's the age of consent in many states and they say damn
00:15:23 Damn
00:15:24 Into those fourth graders. Let's see. Oh, you can't get the turtle. Yeah. Yeah fuck shit. No, thanks, bitch
00:15:31 Yeah, say yeah, save up for that turtle save up for that turtle
00:15:34 I get that turtle. We got to get that turtle again and hope that it doesn't crash the fucking game again
00:15:43 So, uh, oh
00:15:46 Man before it was doing a thing before fuck it was doing a thing before I'll point it out
00:15:50 I'll point it out when it happens again. I'm sure it'll happen again, but the fractions. Oh, dude
00:15:55 You're indignant. You're indignant. He's going crazy, dude. Oh shit. I'm so shitty
00:16:00 Oh
00:16:02 You got too much indignity you got too much indignity. Oh, oh shit. Oh fuck. I'm shit at this game. Yeah. Yeah, you really are
00:16:10 I can't I can't believe it. I can't believe you would let the bugs do this
00:16:13 This would be fine if it was a toad, but since it's a frog it's a little bit
00:16:17 I can't I can't believe you would give the fucking these these bugs the satisfaction of owning your ass so thoroughly
00:16:24 Hey
00:16:26 Oh my fucking god, I literally fucking hate this program and I I I was just talking about before the show how much
00:16:32 How cool it is. It's literally the fucking worst thing I've ever seen before
00:16:36 Yeah, you had nothing but praise for this piece of shit for this piece of shit server
00:16:40 This piece of shit
00:16:41 By the way, the way we're doing this viewer is that munchies playing it in in the rabbit something called rabbit and like
00:16:49 So is it working?
00:16:51 No Jesus fuck
00:16:54 I have no idea how to remedy this it
00:16:59 It fucking worked before it worked. I don't know what to do, Ben
00:17:05 Like the game you can't you can't fucking continue the all right all right
00:17:15 Is there some other fucking screen sharing app I I I don't we could do skype I guess
00:17:22 I don't even have skype on my computer. Wait, can you and even why can you not do it through um
00:17:28 Can you not do it through discord?
00:17:31 I don't think so
00:17:33 Let's see
00:17:35 I mean, well, obviously we're not gonna fucking use this shit because it sucks. Yeah, this really this really sucks
00:17:41 Uh, I can't believe it. I can't believe this
00:17:45 I don't I don't understand. I don't understand the single fucking thing. Let's go to my notifications on twitter
00:17:52 Oh, hey a couple more people liked my post that actually feel good about myself
00:18:00 Then yeah, why are women so easily manipulated? Well
00:18:08 It's because it's because they don't you know, they lack they lack several of the things that we men enjoy
00:18:15 um
00:18:16 moral fiber
00:18:18 And uh and rationality
00:18:21 um, it's the two the the two the two cornerstones of civilization really and
00:18:26 you know
00:18:28 Tragic tragically don't have a prostate male. How are you gonna fucking peg someone without if they don't have a pet prostate?
00:18:34 Yeah, how are you gonna pleasure someone if they don't have a problem? Nothing is more nothing is more pointless than the female anus
00:18:41 Yeah, nothing has ever been more feudal
00:18:44 More feudal feudal japan
00:18:49 There have never been more samurai's than female butts. That's true
00:18:58 Except for this this episode sucks
00:19:08 All right, all right accessibility
00:19:11 All right
00:19:18 Wait, no don't don't turn golly-blin mode on
00:19:24 I don't get what we're oh shit. Should I do classic? Uh, no you go with next gen
00:19:30 Okay. Yeah, you gotta stay up to date. Yeah
00:19:34 um
00:19:36 All right, just play
00:19:39 Yeah
00:19:40 Yeah, I guess so and then hey when you when you get to the when you get to the like upgrade menu
00:19:46 try like
00:19:47 I don't know. I think you can select with the arrow keys. I think
00:19:53 Okay, all right. So here we are a third attempt third attempt to play the the little the little guy game the the game for little guys
00:20:01 A little tiny frog guys little tiny frog boys by the way despite featuring a frog
00:20:07 Um frog fractions does not endorse
00:20:10 Donald trump
00:20:13 Oh my fucking god. I knew they were racist. Yeah. No, this is I can't I can't select with my with my
00:20:20 Key arrow. Okay. You know what? Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I was wrong. Um
00:20:25 Yes
00:20:28 Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh shit. Oh you found it. You found the secret. What the fuck is this shit?
00:20:34 Look at your fruit. Oh my god. I have so many fruits. You got like a billion like a billion
00:20:38 You can now you can afford all the fucking you can afford all the fucking upgrades. Oh my fucking god fruits have been accumulating
00:20:44 They've been accumulating under the sea
00:20:46 Dude, you see you see what I mean the fucking the um, oh my fucking god the turtle functionality
00:20:52 That's fucking insane turtle functionality was is key to the
00:20:57 I knew my my my fucking my fellow animorph my fellow my my fellow jester
00:21:03 animorph
00:21:05 My fellow fucking
00:21:08 Pig in red clothing. Uh, here we go. Pig in red clothing. Yeah. Yeah
00:21:13 Um, oh my fucking god. I'm so powerful. Are you sold? Are you sold on frog fractions yet?
00:21:20 Oh my god. I'm so what's this mother fucker doing in the background. What's he what's his story?
00:21:25 Wait, can you still move?
00:21:27 Uh, yeah, oh few few if I don't see you move for a while. I assume everything's gone to seed
00:21:33 Um, no, I I I just don't I just don't feel the need to that little totem answer
00:21:38 Yeah. Yeah, the little little little fucking little little gestapo
00:21:43 I don't know man. It's just part of the deep lore of frog fractions. I guess
00:21:47 Uh, he frog fractions doesn't even fucking do my taxes for me. No, man. It's gonna it pays dividends
00:21:54 It pays, you know, it's hard. It's hard work now, but in the future you'll be glad you look bad back on this
00:22:00 And say I'm so glad that ben beat me up and made me learn math
00:22:04 Because that's what I do. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. The chicks don't dig on cyborg
00:22:09 Probably shouldn't be that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you can get a cybernetic brain
00:22:14 Or you can get yeah, yeah get the get the static cling tongue. You want that you want that? All right. All right
00:22:19 It's gonna fuck. It's gonna fuck these bugs right up
00:22:23 Oh my fucking god. Yeah. Oh these bugs you see that you see that you see how many bugs you can eat in a single blow
00:22:30 Oh, my fucking god, dude bugs can't even fucking do their own taxes. They have to get it fucking white people do it for
00:22:38 Those fucks
00:22:40 Oh, dude, dude, dude, what is that? What is fuck is it? Okay? Okay? Oh my god

00:26:51 Oh fuck. Okay. It's time. It's time to get serious. Oh
00:26:56 All right, I wonder if the big guy has any tips about dealing with fractions
00:27:00 Ah
00:27:03 Oh, fuck. Okay. Oh god
00:27:05 Oh, he's unfortunate
00:27:08 No, no, no, no, no
00:27:12 Holy shit
00:27:15 Okay, so now you're in now you're in the court of bug mars
00:27:20 You're accused of breaking and entering your native habitat bug mars with intent to perloin our delicious space. Oh, fuck. I'm surrounded by bugs
00:27:27 A minimum sentence of 20 years hard labor, but there's a special offer this week
00:27:31 How'd you like to become a naturalized citizen of bug mars?
00:27:35 um, um, um
00:27:37 Oh
00:27:39 Oh, I you know, I'm
00:27:41 I I I have an affinity for bugs as we all seen in hashtag bug wars
00:27:46 I I I actually killed a bug and I and I and I'm more I'm more and it's lost heavily
00:27:50 He's now he's a fully realized pcp character the bug that died
00:27:55 He's real bug that died
00:27:57 Excellent. All you need to do is pass a test on the history and culture of this fine planet
00:28:01 Shall we we begin our bug plan flag as far as bug stripes?
00:28:04 I wonder I wonder why there's why there's uh the american the united states flag in bug mars, but it's fine. Yeah, that's
00:28:11 Shit, you're right. That's a that's a contradiction or is it just room for deeper lore?
00:28:17 Oh, it's obviously just fucking bugs a little bit on the nose, isn't it?
00:28:22 You can blame bug betsy ross for that one next question on the series bug
00:28:27 What is bug snooker's favorite player of ice cream?
00:28:30 Huh, when are we gonna get where are we gonna get to to troll jeegus?
00:28:34 When are we gonna get to that part of the history lesson here?
00:28:36 Uh, so wrong and it's all right four score and 20 bugs go bug in chief bug thomas chefferson
00:28:40 I literally I literally made the joke bug thomas chefferson like two days ago. Did I literally did you now?
00:28:48 I I I called him thomas bugerson thomas bugger. Well, you fucked it up because his name was bug thomas jefferson
00:28:56 As you can see so you so you fail you don't get to be a naturalized citizen
00:29:01 The only right you'll ever need. Oh fuck. I wasn't paying attention. Uh
00:29:06 You're you're you're you're crushing it munchie. You're I think I think they're I think the bugs are gonna accept you as one of their own
00:29:12 I think I think I think you've got this on lock frankly quite frankly. I mean, obviously
00:29:19 I mean, let me just drink my fucking
00:29:23 Sunrise I you know, you know, really I think bug mars is is is pretty a bunch of a bunch of crackpot in the spears day theorists
00:29:30 I think they I think they're all like 9 11 truthers. I don't think they really know what the fuck's going on
00:29:34 That's an entire people you that's an entire people you're throwing under the bus there
00:29:38 They're fucking bugs who cares last question mr. Hobb. How do you feel about fractions?
00:29:44 Oh, man, this is this is the only question that is
00:29:49 Shit
00:29:51 Oh, you know, I gotta say
00:29:53 Ever since that day that I spit my nose
00:29:57 Juice outside of my body and the entire class saw me with my with my pants down legally and figuratively
00:30:04 Yeah, I've I've always known that I is my favorite my favorite ninja turtles Raphael. Yeah, I love them
00:30:12 Dick Masterson aka Raphael
00:30:14 I know right fractions. I'm impressed. Here's the first perfect score in our fake naturalization program
00:30:20 We were going to fire you into the sun, but instead we decided to give you a work visa
00:30:26 Yolo
00:30:29 But
00:30:31 Yeah
00:30:34 Oh here
00:30:37 Yeah, yeah, yeah, um, yeah, please do this right do this right and never never regret it. Oh my god
00:30:44 All right. All right. All right. How are you guys? This is gonna. This is gonna define your life on bug mars from here on out
00:30:50 I'm a bug. You did it, dude. Mars fractions are the best. Yep, well, oh my, oh fuck,
00:31:03 oh fuck, back right into the frame. Back to the old grind. This is, this is, this is
00:31:08 where you belong. This is, this is what you're most comfortable. This is what you were trained
00:31:12 for. Oh, the indignity, dude. The fucking indignity. Oh my god, bugs. Hey, what was that
00:31:17 thing that just fell? Bugs, why? I, I, I, oh my god, oh my god. What, what kind of
00:31:22 doubloons will they have on fucking bug Mars? Um, there's, there's plenty. Uh, PR. PR department.
00:31:30 Oh, I need, I need some, I need some branding. I need branding. Uh, it's too expensive. You
00:31:34 can get durians. Yeah, I want durians. I want, I want to go down into, uh, oh. Oh. Well,
00:31:42 this is just like my second bar mitzvah I had because I was disowned at my first one.
00:31:50 You know, you know what they say, um, a bar mitzvah in the hand is worth two in the bush.
00:32:12 I, you know, it almost feels like a disservice to talk over this part because you're meant,
00:32:19 because you're meant to just, you're meant to just sail around and listen to a calm voice explain
00:32:25 to you the history of boxing. But, let me turn my volume all the way up. But fuck it.
00:32:42 All right, I guess there's no more voice. I guess not. It'll, he'll be back. He'll be back
00:32:47 eventually. I guess in the meantime, just check out that sweet puffer fish. Well, he's gone now.
00:32:52 Fish ain't even shitty. I haven't even killed my dad yet.
00:32:54 Hey, look, it's a dory. It's a finding dory.
00:32:59 It's me. Can you prove it? I love what happened because I can't remember it.
00:33:10 Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. While I vape, seems like the time for it.
00:33:22 Vape, vape, vape all day long. Vape, vape, vape. It's basically my whole personality.
00:33:29 Vape, vape, vape. He wears a thong. Vape, vape, vape. He's always wrong. His name is...
00:33:36 As, as Christian Weston Chandler once so creatively put it,
00:33:43 rap, rap, rap. That's a rap.
00:33:47 His words. His words, not mine. His words, not mine in the word, words of Christ.
00:33:54 Life is like a movie. And this movie doesn't have a surprise ending. The good guys win, quote from
00:34:01 J.C.W. Connors. I hate it when movies surprise me.
00:34:08 Oh, that one didn't even look like a fucking sea guy. That was a... Oh, it's a...
00:34:11 Coal! It's a coothaloo. It's a, it's a, it's a cuddle. It's a cuddlefish for cuddling.
00:34:19 Cuddlefish. Yeah, yeah. It's a horitair. It's a, it's a flathooloo.
00:34:22 It's a, it's a, it's a, yeah, horitair. That's right. It's a, it's a, it's a, hey,
00:34:29 don't click that. Don't click that. Don't click that. Okay. So, so sorry, Meister.
00:34:36 You know, you know, Ben, if there was one character that I could relate to you in all of
00:34:42 media fiction itself, it would be the heat miser from, from that one, like Claymation Santa Claus one.
00:34:51 The heat meister? The heat meister. Yeah. The heat meister. You mean the burger meister?
00:34:56 No, not the, well, the burger meister also as well. However, not.
00:35:01 The heat meister is a completely different original character.
00:35:04 You're talking about one of those Claymation Christmas specials?
00:35:08 Yeah. Yeah. Must not be one I've seen, because I don't know, I don't know any,
00:35:11 but I don't know anybody by the name of heat meister, sir.
00:35:16 I'm Mr. Heat Meister. I'm basically fucking sick.
00:35:21 Um, you know what they say, um, heat meister, heat meister, at the door,
00:35:28 run away quick, or you'll run no more. Yep. Magic the Gathering.
00:35:36 Dude, one time I was over, I was over at my cousin's house and we were playing,
00:35:42 we were playing fucking, uh, Magic Gathering. And all of a sudden, and, and, and it was on his
00:35:48 Xbox, he didn't actually have the cards on the Xbox version. So, so, so, so, so we were playing
00:35:55 and all of a sudden he just, he just starts jacking it and I leave the room.
00:35:59 Why'd you leave, faggot?
00:36:03 Because I didn't want to air up.
00:36:07 You clearly, clearly you don't know how to read the room, Munchy. Clearly you don't know how to
00:36:14 read the mood. Uh, that, well, you know, hey, it's a symptom of autism, I guess.
00:36:20 Yeah. We're all on the spectrum.
00:36:23 You know, I think it would be a leased artist, honestly.
00:36:28 Yeah, I think I would consider myself a leased game. Oh, God. Jesus Christ. Oh,
00:36:37 possibly my favorite thing you've ever said.
00:36:39 Oh, my God, it's Futurama. It's a, it's a crashed Futurama.
00:36:46 All right, now it's time for the true game to begin. Oh, my God. Hey, question,
00:36:53 are you capturing, is your, is OBS going to capture that mouse?
00:36:58 Yeah. There's no way to stop that. Oh, well, well, there is, but whatever.
00:37:04 Uh, that's fine. I just, we'll just throw this video out in the trash, where it belongs.
00:37:12 And by the trash, I mean the procrastinators channel. Okay. Now here, now this is for real.
00:37:19 Now this is the real shit, the raw shit.
00:37:24 Um, I feel an intense sound of pressure. You calm down and start taking your surroundings
00:37:29 for the first time since the seemingly dormant vessel sprang the life. The walls of the circular
00:37:33 room curve to meet at a point that must correspond to the curved nose of the outer hull lining the
00:37:37 walls. You see a porthole, a glowing display and a control deck. A ladder leads aft. Um, okay.
00:37:45 What? Oh, dude. What? Oh, no.
00:37:50 Did you, wait, wait, I see a tab. I see it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Please tell me that the game's
00:37:55 still open. Yeah, it, it won't let me go to it for some reason. What?
00:38:05 Is this, it's, is this like part of the game? No, no. This is part of the gameplay experience.
00:38:14 Well, maybe you should close all those other new tabs.
00:38:16 I can't interact with it at all. What? No. It's, it's locked me out.
00:38:32 Well, what do I do? Why, why? Oh, wait, wait, wait.
00:38:42 It seems to be responding. Wait, well, well, like, like, like, can you like minimize it and then open
00:38:53 it again or something? Yeah, here. I'll go over a different tab real quick. I'll go, I'll go to Twitter.
00:39:01 Yeah. Something, something needs, something must be done. This, this won't stand.
00:39:08 Fucking rabbit. I hate it. I don't like it anymore. I, I can't fucking doing anything.
00:39:21 No, I'll, I'll, I'll change, I'll change like, like the broadcast
00:39:25 shit. Maybe. Oh, fuck. What? What? Oh, it just, it just looked crazy for a second. I missed it.
00:39:32 Nope. Still, still can't do anything.
00:39:38 The game's like safe over here. Yeah.
00:39:45 The question is just how do we get to it?
00:39:51 What happens when you right click? Nothing? Nothing. Because it's not doing anything?
00:39:58 Yeah, yeah. Like, I can move, I can move my mouse around, but it's not like, I can't interact with
00:40:03 anything. Yeah. Oh, wait, is that mouse in like the, the rabbit window? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see.
00:40:18 I don't know, man. Might have to restart. Oh, my fucking god. Why? Why? Why were we cursed?
00:40:36 Try like, opening a new window and like, see if rabbit works in a new window or something?
00:40:42 Like, like, okay. Yeah. Yeah.
00:40:51 All right. All right. All right. All right. Should I close the original one?
00:40:59 It's pretty risky. I don't know. I mean, I'll still have it open. If you close it, will this like,
00:41:07 whole thing end? Here, no, I'll give you the power. Okay. Wait, can you just like,
00:41:15 fucking transfer it to me? I think so, yeah. Oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah, do that. All right,
00:41:22 you know that little thing next to the volume that says remote control? Click on that.
00:41:25 Oh, my god, I've got the fucking power. All right, all right. No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm closing
00:41:37 that and then you'll be in charge and then I'll go back. Okay, but mine's, it's not letting me
00:41:45 do anything either. I, yeah, wait, why did, wait, are you Joseph? Oh, oh, hey, oh, oh, yeah, yeah,
00:41:52 I'm Joseph. I'm Joseph. How did, okay, is it saved? Is it fucking saved? I, I, I, I, I think so. Oh,
00:42:00 my god. It's a miracle. Yes. How, how, how did it work? Okay, whatever. That's great. Thank god.
00:42:13 Okay, now I see, now I see that there actually isn't any way, retrieve arms. Well done.
00:42:20 Now I, now I see that there actually isn't any way to get rid of that cursor because
00:42:24 that's just how rabbit works. That's fine. Yeah. Um, okay. Um, well, you can go to the
00:42:30 porthole, the display or the control deck. I think there's doors too. Okay, hold on.
00:42:38 Okay, okay, okay, okay. You're in, you're in a space spaceship hull command mod. You're in the,
00:42:46 you're in the command, the command module. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:43:02 No, no, no, you're in, you're in the command module. Oh, shit. Okay. Fuck.
00:43:07 Yeah, here we go. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
00:43:15 All right, let's check, let's see what my, what my, what my, what my, uh, my, my fetch modus is.
00:43:21 No, you got nothing. You got no, you got no modus, no modus operandi.
00:43:26 Shit. I'm talking like away from the modus operandi.
00:43:28 Getting money fastest by modus operandi. I've been ice cold since the night I saw my man die.
00:43:34 Yeah, yeah, my modus operandi is a malgum, a freelancer in the way of the samurai.
00:43:41 How do I live without you?
00:43:46 If I don't live without you.
00:43:49 We're seeing the two different ones, even though they're both the right, they can be real.
00:43:54 Um, look at the-
00:43:56 I wanna know how I ever, ever survive.
00:44:03 Wow, wow, wow.
00:44:04 Okay, okay, okay, okay, wait, just, just like look, just like look everywhere.
00:44:12 Okay. Yeah, let's go like look display or porthole.
00:44:20 I don't want, I don't want to have to fucking-
00:44:23 Here we go. A glowing green display shows a map of the galaxy with a destination you don't recognize.
00:44:28 An ETA of about 3,000 years, looking closer you see two on-screen buttons labeled root details
00:44:34 and new destination.
00:44:40 I'm gonna turn this bitch around.
00:44:41 The nav computer dumps you into an interface so obstruc that before you even consciously
00:44:45 process what's happening you've hit the back button and are at the main map again.
00:44:49 Excellent.
00:44:51 You two, you got your little frog brain, can't handle it.
00:44:54 Even though you fucking got the cyber brain that let you understand the wizardry of exponential
00:45:00 functions or exponential scientific notation, whatever.
00:45:04 Even though I'm frog Carl Karl Marx and I've invented communism I still can't wrap my brain
00:45:11 around simple reader functions.
00:45:14 Do root details.
00:45:19 Fuck.
00:45:24 The screen spills forth a slew of steps such as spiral spinward at Spathi system,
00:45:29 far faster than you can fathom.
00:45:37 Oh shit, it wouldn't let me do it all.
00:45:41 Uh, hmm, well, looks like you can't do anything with this, maybe?
00:45:50 Okay, what do you got?
00:45:51 You got the porthole and something else.
00:45:55 There was some other thing.
00:45:56 Ben, when am I gonna go back to doing bath in the third grade?
00:46:00 Soon, soon.
00:46:02 You just have to fucking, you just have to fucking escape from the cold abyss of space.

00:48:50 I want to see him grow up.
00:48:54 No, no, the pathos.
00:48:57 No, I want to see my big baby.
00:49:01 I'm a cool, I'm a cold, unfeeling, phony, two-faced, amoral protagonist, down on my luck.
00:49:10 And I've been in jail.
00:49:13 I haven't seen my big baby boy grow up.
00:49:16 He's been without his big old daddy.
00:49:18 He's even- a big baby boy has an even bigger daddy.
00:49:22 Rule number one of thorough dynamics.
00:49:26 Big baby boy has an even bigger daddy.
00:49:32 Oh, fuck.
00:49:35 I want to see him.
00:49:37 I want to see my- I want to give my baby boy a big, a big dad.
00:49:47 He deserves one.
00:49:50 No, Jesus. Jesus Christ, Munchie.
00:49:56 Oh, what the fuck?
00:49:57 Why don't we- I blacked out.
00:49:58 What are we doing?
00:49:59 Why don't we sleep?
00:50:00 I don't- you go and say look- just say look port hole.
00:50:03 Just say look port hole.
00:50:06 God, through the portal you can see a background of starshifting as the ship gently spins the
00:50:11 constellations.
00:50:14 Okay, um, fuck, just do look, because there's one other thing, and I guess you got to do the last
00:50:18 thing.
00:50:20 All right, uh, control-
00:50:23 Fuck.
00:50:24 Control deck.
00:50:25 Oh wait, oh no, you can go to- yeah, it's- okay, I don't know, it's either the control deck or the ladder.
00:50:34 Okay, say look control deck.
00:50:36 All right.
00:50:40 The control deck consists of an array of switches and a pair of joysticks.
00:50:43 Let's hope you never need to override the ship's autopilot, because these are definitely not
00:50:47 frog joysticks.
00:50:48 You should definitely fuck with them.
00:50:54 I don't understand what you want to fuck.
00:50:59 With them.
00:51:00 With them is what I want to fuck.
00:51:03 Fuck.
00:51:03 Um, say like, say like, say like, uh, uh-
00:51:07 Wait, wait, oh, wait, I fucking got it, I fucking got it.
00:51:11 Yeah.
00:51:16 No!
00:51:19 Fuck!
00:51:22 Okay, okay, okay, okay, enough pussy footage.
00:51:25 We need to go all in on learning fractions.
00:51:27 No more, no more pathos, no more big babies, no more big baby boys.
00:51:31 We need to fucking get- we need to do it.
00:51:34 Yeah, um, uh, push- wait, wait, push, push switch, push switch, push switches.
00:51:43 Oh, whatever.
00:51:45 Um, all right, go to the ladder.
00:51:48 This game is made by fucking little, little, little, little bit of a- you know what they call them.
00:51:55 Yeah, yeah, go to- go to ladder, go to ladder.
00:51:59 Or go aft.
00:52:01 Later, go to later, fucking nerd.
00:52:05 This is- looks like before you go and learn fractions, you better go learn to spell.
00:52:09 Ben, you are going to be vaporized into a fucking pooper-dipe-wearing baby fuck.
00:52:14 I'm gonna vape myself into a pooper-dipe-wearing baby fuck, you know what I'm saying?
00:52:18 This looks like an all-purpose living area.
00:52:20 A sleeping pod sits next to a nightstand.
00:52:22 A ladder leads to the four.
00:52:24 Okay, that's where you just were.
00:52:25 An oriental rug lies in the center.
00:52:28 You can't say that anymore.
00:52:29 Dude, check the rug.
00:52:33 All right, you know- okay.
00:52:39 The decorative oriental rug sits in the center of the room looking at it more closely.
00:52:43 It doesn't quite lay flat on the floor.
00:52:45 There's a significant dip around the middle.
00:52:48 Okay, maybe you gotta move it.
00:52:51 All right.
00:52:53 Moving the rug, you discover a recessed hatch.
00:52:55 Your score has gone up by two-fifths of a point.
00:52:58 Fuck- Oh, shit.
00:52:59 Fuck yes.
00:53:00 Fuck yes.
00:53:01 That's how you know it's progress.
00:53:03 They should remake this game, but the entire time,
00:53:07 overlaid on top of the entire game are two tracks.
00:53:10 Number one, the John Tron theme song at full blast of, like, maximum game.
00:53:15 In other words, not even recognizable anymore.
00:53:17 And then second, to balance it out,
00:53:20 put the angry video game nerd as well at full game, maximum blast over it.
00:53:28 Oh, Zoli, Quinn!
00:53:29 The joke is gamer culture.
00:53:34 Because gamers are a joke and gamers are over.
00:53:41 Gamers are dead.
00:53:43 Long with gamers.
00:53:46 Gamer justice!
00:53:48 Gamers, um, video games.
00:53:53 Okay.
00:53:57 open it you have to work you have to give the wheels a few spins the hatchpops
00:54:06 open okay
00:54:10 enter hatch go go to hatch yeah enter what what else was there there was a
00:54:19 you slipped through the hatch nearly every service in this room is covered
00:54:26 with a sticky pink goop which seems to be thicker near a gray machine a gray
00:54:30 machine sitting in the corner a hole in the wall exposes a nest of wires there's
00:54:35 a hatch leading back okay yeah that's that's what you just were okay um make
00:54:41 shit can town I only used it as far as can okay okay there's sticky goop there's
00:54:50 a gray machine and there's a hole in the wall these are these are the things these
00:54:55 with which we can fuck all right all right
00:55:01 shucks shit fuck this machine this machine won't be moved by your human by
00:55:10 your human desires by your human but my human etiquette no that that I really I
00:55:18 really want to get all up in that pink goop in yeah that's all I want I just
00:55:22 want to get mad fucking into that I just want to get super embroiled in that
00:55:25 fucking pink goop you real you are pink goop munchie you're that's what you're
00:55:31 made of anyone's ever said to me it's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me
00:55:34 like you're like you're like Winnie the Pooh like he when he was but with
00:55:41 sludge and goop yeah instead of fluff yes oh I thought you mean like he was
00:55:46 eating honey and that and that was gonna be oh the oh yeah actually that works
00:55:50 too that works too yeah you just got pots you just got pots and pots you just
00:55:54 got cans and cans of it look at look at examine the machine that's not you didn't
00:56:07 verb it you didn't verb it right the machine consists of a spigot aimed at a
00:56:12 flat platform a hand sheet of paper has been hastily taped over the base of the
00:56:17 platform definitely look at that paper this is the out-of-order note included
00:56:27 in your game package okay sure sounds good look at the hole in the wall a
00:56:38 spigot aimed at a flat platform that's Minecraft just go to just say just do
00:56:45 look at hole all right yeah cool yeah look hole go just head over to the look
00:56:54 hole peering into the exposed machine there you see what looks like an empty
00:56:57 coffee can that you're guessing doesn't belong there see it knew what you were
00:57:07 trying to do it damn it knew what you were trying to do there but it won't
00:57:11 it's not having it why why is it so fucking bigoted because it was made
00:57:18 because it was made by Mars bugs and Mars bugs lack empathy because they all
00:57:23 have all my god bugs they haven't even they haven't even fucking they haven't
00:57:28 even released and vanquished that the the synopete of their soul you do you
00:57:33 know do you know how do you know how you know that bugs are are bad and lack
00:57:38 moral fiber it's because they don't even they don't even have muskles they
00:57:43 can't even lift they don't even have muskles all their limbs are controlled
00:57:47 by by fucking liquid hydraulics they don't lift munchy they can't lift you
00:57:51 know how you know that bows are amoral why because they're white now we're
00:58:03 into the stars to start a race war comes a kid with a knack for propaganda
00:58:12 this is the theme song of Adolf Hitler get that can oh my god I can actually
00:58:32 make can town now you twist the can and eventually comes loose but you've ripped
00:58:36 the insulation off of an adjacent wire in the process and it begins sparking as
00:58:40 it comes in contact with an adjacent strut you glance down at what you've
00:58:43 taken huh it really is a coffee can alright so you've got the can you've
00:58:49 got the machine you've got the hole in the wall and I think that's it for this
00:58:54 room was there something else in this room what was the term of it it was
00:59:04 it was machine it was goop oh goop yeah yeah yeah it was pink pink goop is what
00:59:12 they called it fuck fuck shit can you like put put put goop in can you need
00:59:28 to be hold okay okay get get get goop get ye to the goop sir yes yes is all I
00:59:34 fucking goop is stuck to the surface could you not just scrape some off I
00:59:38 scrape off goop from my body all the time I guess it's really I guess it's
00:59:43 really sticky like hella sticky so I scoop off sticky substance for my body
00:59:51 all the time I don't think you understand just how sticky this goop is this
00:59:56 goop because it could it possibly be more sticky this is this all of my blood
01:00:03 clots this goop is this goop is made of a thousand neutron stars this goop is my
01:00:11 god this goop is a neutron star that has been that has been ejaculated all over
01:00:16 into the stars to drink the pink goop starts a race war
01:00:25 well really gets around well I don't mind being plagiarized in various
01:00:33 different ways by me wait who who is that who is being plagiarized Jimmy
01:00:37 neutron oh the boy Jesus himself I I know I know exactly what to do but I don't
01:00:46 want to tell you because I feel like I'd be cheating fucking okay I remember yeah
01:00:53 this took this took me this puzzle took me a long fucking time I think I actually
01:00:57 I think I had to look up like one step of it I I didn't sign up to be fucking
01:01:05 Sherlock Holmes all right dude this is what it takes this is what it takes to
01:01:12 be a frog a frog in bug marks you have to be you have to be clever as well as
01:01:17 dexterous okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so you got the can there's a
01:01:22 machine and they don't remember if there's any there's a hole in the wall
01:01:26 there's the goop yeah there's the goop there's the hole in the wall there's the
01:01:30 machine you can't scoop the goop you can't scoop the goop munchy because it's
01:01:35 too sticky let's see what's on the machine again the machine consists of a
01:01:38 spigot aimed at a flat platform a handwritten sheet of paper has been
01:01:41 hastily taped over the base of the platform spigot and you see if I can
01:01:49 look at the platform yeah the machine oh same that really boils there's a
01:01:59 spigot there's the paper it's been taped on the platform and I guess that's it I
01:02:07 guess that's it for the machine it's just those two things you rip the note
01:02:12 off leaving a fluttering piece of electrical tape behind and revealing
01:02:16 hey all right I knew to facing public property will get me somewhere oh fuck
01:02:27 I'm retarded you are but that's just odd that's just autism for you yeah I mean
01:02:35 you know what is the questions of the day what of the control panel is rendered
01:02:39 unusual by the sticky pink goop you see a row of what look like radio preset
01:02:42 buttons all but two of which are stuck there's also a big red lever none of
01:02:47 these are legibly labeled okay so you got two buttons and a lever the machine
01:02:53 the machine where is dispensing mom's specialty the voice says pink goop
01:02:57 streams out of the faucets splashing against the flat platform and getting
01:03:00 everywhere a couple drops land in your mouth and you recognize the flavor bacon
01:03:04 milkshake oh my god atmospheric anomaly detected a different voice says a
01:03:09 wearing sound ensues and the bulk of the goop is sucked into invisible vents
01:03:12 leaving just enough goop floating around to be gross and annoying atmosphere
01:03:16 purified the voice says triumphantly okay okay so that good that goop is
01:03:22 floating meaning it's not stuck to the surfaces meaning oh I want that goop I
01:03:28 want that goop I want that you can't oh you can't get a meaningful amount just
01:03:31 by collecting loose goop fuck shit I fuck I thought that was it I thought we
01:03:38 okay well you know what okay well I think okay you know you you gotta get you
01:03:44 gotta get it to shoot into the can you just gotta squirt it right into the can
01:03:47 all right wait it came out of the faucet does that mean the spigot
01:03:56 you platform platform so hasty you place the can below the spigot okay yeah okay
01:04:13 here we go here we go it mostly gets everywhere but the coffee can does end
01:04:21 up filled you grab the can atmospheric anomaly detected the vents do their
01:04:24 ineffectual thing atmosphere purified so that's all I want I'm at mystery to
01:04:30 be purified so you reminds me of that one time I was hanging with my bro Mike
01:04:34 Pence and he and he got fucking all the blood everywhere yeah was it was it the
01:04:40 stuff of neutron stars no it was actually acid and they destroyed all my
01:04:44 furniture and I haven't had him back since he was he was totally wasted this
01:04:49 always always forgiven thank God he thank God he went on to bigger and
01:04:55 better things those drops earlier were enough bacon milkshake for one lifetime
01:05:01 thanks well all right man you've got a cat you've got a can of bacon milkshake
01:05:10 hey you know what there okay there was one there was one I think you're done
01:05:15 here except there is one step that like took me forever and I had to look up so
01:05:19 I'm just gonna tell you you got to grab the tape the tape the tape that the tape
01:05:23 that the thing was was let was taped there with is important okay now you got
01:05:28 to go you got to use the tape and the and I put the tape on the sparking wire
01:05:32 in the hole in the wall you read yep there we go all right yeah that that
01:05:42 that was the one that was the killer that I never figured out okay wasting that
01:05:48 guy killed Michael Jordan yeah I bet his ear right off bet his ear right off in
01:05:54 the box where were you when the United States invaded my personal privacy by
01:06:03 downloading my internet history all of which consumed were consumed by Google
01:06:10 embassy churches of my rightful son that was taken away from me for a crime I
01:06:15 didn't commit big baby I want pictures of big baby I want to see him grow a big
01:06:22 baby spider-man talking to spider-man I need pictures of the big baby the big
01:06:31 boy I have to see him grow he's growing somewhere out there I'm missing it I'm
01:06:40 fucking missing it I was stuck in a turkey's prison for all my life and I
01:06:46 broken out just to see my big baby boy he's getting bigger and bigger this baby
01:06:54 this baby's getting bigger by the minute you know I'm saying oh my god are you
01:06:58 son of a fucking nightmare scenario what's that I don't know where the baby
01:07:03 boy is bigger than the big learn the bigger dad
01:07:12 the baby big baby boy gets so fucking big that the bigger dad just just can't
01:07:19 fucking compete can't keep up in what happens can't keep up with his with the
01:07:23 baby then how will I currency survive how is this how is the system of
01:07:28 government gonna fucking hold up it's a bigger baby get some bigger did a big
01:07:32 old daddy yeah dads dads grow linearly dads grow linearly babies grow
01:07:37 exponentially in the fullness of time a baby's eclipse there eclipse their dads
01:07:41 and bigness this is the issue with all the Roman Empire now it's gonna fall to
01:07:45 the it's gonna lead to the fall of the big baby empire babies as emtotically
01:07:50 approach infinite bigness you got to leave the hatch you got to leave the
01:08:00 hatch right you're done here I think go go to hatch okay cabin's quarters a
01:08:10 sleeping pod sits next to it okay I guess examine the sleeping pod no you
01:08:19 fucked it you fucked it you exame I think I think you did everything in the
01:08:29 other room well there was nothing else to do with like the control panel because
01:08:34 it just wouldn't let you do anything the sleeping pod looks like a bed with a
01:08:36 lid but you've got to assume it's got some sort of suspended animation
01:08:39 functionality I mean right there's a hole on the top next to a gauge reading
01:08:45 empty that seems important okay all right use goop on hole you bring the can
01:09:00 close to the hole and the hole sucks the pink group right in the gate the nearby
01:09:04 gauge fills up your score has gone up by nine halves of a point so is it done I
01:09:19 is it ready I don't know is it ready try I don't know for any of us are ready for
01:09:26 for a parenthood true I don't know if we can all if we can't even be prepared for
01:09:33 the for the biggest boy the world's ever gonna see the biggest the biggest
01:09:37 responsibility the biggest adventure of all the biggest adventure of all child
01:09:42 rearing child child husbandry as it's known I wait try getting in the pod
01:09:52 Gert Gert in Bud you can't safely sleep until you're confident you return to
01:09:59 bug Mars by the end of the trip I think what what what does this blast game want
01:10:13 me to do and what does that to do with reuniting with my fucking son was was
01:10:17 there more to the pod or did you do everything with that I I think you did
01:10:22 me okay maybe you got to go fuck around maybe you got to go aft yeah yeah yeah
01:10:27 the sleeping pod looks like a bed with a lid yeah yeah yeah there's a hole in the
01:10:31 top next to a gauge reading full okay all right I guess I guess that's all there
01:10:35 is I think you should go to the ladder and go back to the control panel a command
01:10:44 the walls of the circular to meet at a point that must correspond to the curve
01:10:47 knows the hole a porthole a glowing display okay check the display because
01:10:54 you tried the control deck and it didn't do anything
01:10:58 no this no this is this is this is a this is a go to new destination then
01:11:15 have computer no no okay that's no good try root details again I feel like
01:11:23 something must have changed you did all the screen splits forth yeah alright go
01:11:31 to the control deck what look look control deck no no no no no no frog
01:11:46 fractions listen Ben not everyone could have studied how to make the perfect big
01:11:51 baby I was gonna mess up along the way but that's that that's just part of the
01:11:57 parenting process you know learning learning as you go learning as you go
01:12:01 you and the baby can learn together the control just imagine a big baby would
01:12:07 just fucking break all my bones immediately up on looking at it these are
01:12:14 definitely not frog joysticks there's got to be something you can do with these
01:12:25 you you fix the you fix the you got the goop you filled you filled yeah you'll
01:12:34 have to be more specific as to what you want to do with the controls okay okay
01:12:39 move them what do you got you have an an array of switches and a pair of joysticks
01:12:49 I don't know what do you do with what do you do with joysticks
01:12:59 what the fuck great great great I'm stumped I'm stumped wait look at the
01:13:16 porthole again I mean it didn't it didn't show anything before through the
01:13:23 porthole you can see the background of stars yeah the constellations are all
01:13:27 unfamiliar okay so that's no help
01:13:33 hmm I'm getting the sinking suspicion that everything we've done up to this
01:13:43 point has been a major waste of time yes like in Homestuck for example like in
01:13:50 Homestuck just like the classic panel the classic panel retcon later in a
01:13:57 month in one of it I don't know in one of the moves that was maybe not the worst
01:14:02 in one of the retcons that was maybe not the worst in Homestuck
01:14:09 the battle the bat the bit wait you want to just look up what to do yeah I
01:14:21 have no idea what the fucks going on okay okay here I'll do it
01:14:27 all right here we go here we go here we go here we go
01:14:43 oh oh dude oh dude no you got to go back to the machine you didn't do
01:14:49 everything with the machine oh yeah okay okay okay actually wait there's
01:14:58 yeah yeah yeah yeah there's yeah there's something there's something else to do
01:15:07 in the machine room and there's something else to do in the captain's
01:15:09 quarters too alright alright alright okay I won't I won't be more specific than
01:15:17 that for now no no no a sleeping pod there's the nightstand there's a sleeping
01:15:30 pod in the nightstand single drawer which is closed well open the drawer
01:15:43 revealing a thick manual fuck yes get thick manual don't I knew I saw I looked
01:15:55 ahead in my fucking spirit guy it's I I rattled my Native American bones I said
01:16:02 when will the next earthquake come and it said oh when Ben fucking does that
01:16:06 shit I knew I would fucking when it happens it happens when when German the
01:16:12 wishcash uses earthquake I know I don't know you're talking about cuz no one
01:16:21 watches that show your I don't even know what you're saying gotta hate Pokemon
01:16:25 gotta hate Pokemon you'll have to be more specific you know do you're gonna
01:16:32 use it what are you gonna use it to whack are you gonna use it to whack the
01:16:35 hideous bumps on your I'm going to use it to see how to raise my son properly
01:16:40 well too bad because there's no way there's no answer because it's a learning
01:16:44 experience monkey it's a journey it's about the oh my god did you do you even
01:16:50 notice what you just did no you call me fucking monkey in earnest did I know
01:16:55 yeah I thought I'd be the only one that wouldn't do it no you know why you
01:17:00 well you know why let me explain it's just because thinking about oh oh you've
01:17:05 got a lot of explaining thinking thinking a lot because thinking about the
01:17:09 nuzlocke's just made me remember how much I hate and resent monkey Jones for
01:17:13 inspiring me to do this fucking stupid misguided retarded quest that I hate and
01:17:17 I hate myself for and I hate everything to do with and I wish I was dead it's a
01:17:23 manual for the navigation computer in the computer man module after leaping
01:17:26 through you feel confident you understand how to use the interface well and if
01:17:29 you set up a route back you bug my eyes yeah okay okay um go no no yeah okay you
01:17:37 can do that too that's fine yeah actually I should do something in the
01:17:42 fucking there there is one that you can do that you can do this now you can do
01:17:45 this here now there's you can fuck with the controls because the last thing yeah
01:17:51 you got it you got to change the you got to change the the route you got to change

01:38:00 unsympathetic ghost shell of a man and an atomic complete robot with no
01:38:07 natural feelings but at least and you may be down on your luck and in a
01:38:12 Turkish prison but once you break out you know you know the first thing on your
01:38:18 fucking list it's gonna be finding your baby boy and making sure he knows that
01:38:22 he's a father that loves him you gotta find the big baby boy and make that big
01:38:27 baby boy have a big old heart and have a big old fiesta with him

01:38:42 touch your little baby boy and you gotta make him know that he's the only
01:38:46 little baby big old big old baby boy in your little fucking life and that one
01:38:51 day one day the throne of bigness will be passed on from from you to him just
01:38:57 that it had been done with your father to you whoever eclipses the other to his
01:39:02 his father and in bigness that's when he should he become a man and then and
01:39:06 whenever whenever the father becomes smaller than his big baby boy son his
01:39:10 his bones evaporate he turns into cloth at the bay the baby boy can use to wear

01:59:11 yeah here's here's how here's when I knew here's when I knew that Dr. Wolf was
01:59:16 not a good person I met him at fucking Brony con at the first Brony con I went
01:59:22 to I we were like making small talk or something and and he was like and he was
01:59:29 like you know sitting all cross-legged and being all like yeah and and he said
01:59:35 something like he was hungry like he wanted to get something to eat and I
01:59:38 was like oh well there's a pretty good hotdog stand right across the the street
01:59:44 like because we were right near the exits and I like pointed right out the door
01:59:47 I was like there's a hotdog stand right over there and he was like I think I can
01:59:52 do a bit better than that and um I thought someone needs to kill this man
02:00:06 nicknames doctor or dog oh good oh good 34 he's 34 and thank God oh okay okay
02:00:19 I I also have a I also have a Dr. Wolf story at that exact same Brony con I
02:00:25 think yeah I think I could do a bit better than that
02:00:29 it's so perfect okay okay okay I forget I think like like like when I first came
02:00:38 up to you guys we were rough we we we we we we were riffin we had um we had a
02:00:48 We had a good report. We got some rapport going.
02:00:52 We were riffing.
02:00:53 Yeah, yeah.
02:00:54 We were riffing.
02:00:56 We were jamming in the name of the Lord.
02:00:58 We were jamming.
02:00:59 Yeah.
02:01:00 And there was like a meme sort of, that I don't know how it occurred.
02:01:07 Bottom right corner. Is telekinesis possible? Check out our science fiction map.
02:01:12 Yeah, for a unicorn it is. For a unicorn it is.
02:01:16 Oh, you.
02:01:17 Anyway, anyway.
02:01:18 Anyway, the point is I go up to Dr. Wolf and he's surrounded by his lesion of fans.
02:01:24 And I ask him.
02:01:25 His adoring fans.
02:01:26 His adoring fans.
02:01:27 His adoring fans.
02:01:28 His adoring fan base.
02:01:29 Rivaled only by KP's weird fucking sycophant horde.
02:01:36 And I ask him two simple questions.
02:01:38 Number one, did the banks kill JFK?
02:01:41 Number two, did you kill Dryden horseshoes?
02:01:46 Did you kill him?
02:01:47 I've heard this, I think. Or at least I've heard the second part.
02:01:51 Yeah, simple questions for a simple man.
02:01:56 For a simple man.
02:01:57 And then like, he's like sitting down cross legged as you described.
02:02:02 Yeah, yeah.
02:02:03 And he looks up to me.
02:02:04 Sitting down cross legged, looking at his laptop with his hand.
02:02:09 Yeah, exactly.
02:02:10 Cleaning to the side with his hand and his chin.
02:02:13 With his hand and his chin, brow furrowed in concentration.
02:02:18 And he looks up to me.
02:02:21 I've never met Dryden horseshoes.
02:02:24 I don't know anything about Dryden horseshoes.
02:02:28 I mean, I know the name, but beyond that, no idea.
02:02:34 Me thinks the lady doth protest too much.
02:02:39 He fucking knows.
02:02:40 He knew.
02:02:41 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:02:43 And I tell that to Jesse later and he said that they've literally talked before.
02:02:47 Oh my God.
02:02:48 So Dr. Wolf lied to my fucking face.
02:02:52 Really, really, really just...
02:02:57 Wow.
02:02:58 You know, has it ever...
02:03:02 You know, I don't think Digi's gonna mind me saying this here.
02:03:06 Because literally nobody gives a shit anymore.
02:03:09 But Digi said that one of his greatest regrets in his life and his career
02:03:16 was fucking featuring that first Dr. Wolf Fluttershy video on Equestria Daily
02:03:21 because it started the monster.
02:03:23 It started the fucking monster that is Dr. Wolf.
02:03:26 Like it's all Digi's fault.
02:03:27 It's all Digi's fault that Dr. Wolf exists.
02:03:30 And it makes him mad and it makes me mad.
02:03:35 Dr. Wolf, fucking look at him.
02:03:38 Just, hold on.
02:03:39 Just look at this fucking guy.
02:03:40 Wait, wait, wait.
02:03:41 Go down.
02:03:42 Go down.
02:03:43 Art...
02:03:44 Oh, artists.
02:03:45 God.
02:03:46 God damn.
02:03:47 Let's see what they have to say about you.
02:03:50 Oh, I'm listed as a fucking artist?
02:03:52 Bulls fucking shit.
02:03:53 Never.
02:03:54 I never drew anything.
02:03:55 I never drew anything for that piece of shit.
02:03:58 That guy, that guy fucking scammed his artists and didn't fucking pay them shit.
02:04:03 He could afford.
02:04:04 He could afford to pay them fairly and he never fucking did.
02:04:08 I heard it from multiple sources that the dude just fucking scammed his artists
02:04:13 and tried to get by paying them next to nothing even though.
02:04:17 He has a fucking real job.
02:04:19 He has a fucking real job.
02:04:21 He's an accountant.
02:04:23 He's making an actual salary and yet he can't fucking afford to take a little bit out of
02:04:32 his fucking rank-eating Patreon.
02:04:34 His Patreon, which is a drop in the fucking bucket to his actual salary,
02:04:38 and just pay his fucking artists.
02:04:41 Fuck that guy.
02:04:42 Believe this innocent face.
02:04:46 Could this face do any wrong, Ben?
02:04:48 Could this face do any wrong?
02:04:53 I hate it, Munchie.
02:04:54 I think not.
02:04:55 I hate him.
02:04:56 I came into this in good faith.
02:04:59 I came into this in good faith.
02:05:01 Oh yeah, Doctor Wolf.
02:05:02 What a funny story about that.
02:05:05 What a silly existence.
02:05:09 But now I'm not laughing anymore, Munchie.
02:05:11 Now I'm mad.
02:05:12 Now I'm mad.
02:05:13 I'm mad again.
02:05:14 Do you like how your page is completely fucking barren?
02:05:22 Good.
02:05:23 Good.
02:05:26 Hold on.
02:05:27 This is the Rift Cafe wiki.
02:05:29 I wish I wasn't on it at all.
02:05:32 When is this going to be a T-Bap wiki?
02:05:35 A whole wiki for T-Bap?
02:05:37 There could have been, man.
02:05:38 There fucking could have been a T-Bap wiki.
02:05:40 Why didn't we do it?
02:05:41 Why didn't we just break off from the fucking thing
02:05:44 and just do our own pony thing?
02:05:46 You just need to fucking hashtag magsurviveT-Bap.
02:05:52 There's too many unleft questions.
02:05:55 There's too many unleft questions.
02:05:57 There's too many plot threads unresolved.
02:06:01 Every time, every single time, me or Nate brings up
02:06:04 raise these bros.
02:06:06 We both just get real quiet and sad
02:06:08 because it never happened and we both wish
02:06:12 that raise these bros had actually happened.
02:06:15 But now it's too late and we don't want to do it anymore.
02:06:18 We wish that back when we had the drive,
02:06:20 we had fucking seen it through and made it happen.
02:06:23 It's never too late.
02:06:24 He happens to be a Mormon.
02:06:26 He happens to be a Mormon.
02:06:28 Shut the fuck up.
02:06:30 Oh, his eldest niece is a brony.
02:06:33 His eldest niece is a brony, Munchy.
02:06:36 Her O.C.
02:06:38 That is insane.
02:06:39 Daffodilia.
02:06:41 Doctor Wolf fell into the psychological...
02:06:44 Wait, wait, wait.
02:06:45 The psychological role of the brony fan
02:06:47 without respecting it, expecting it at all.
02:06:50 Even before he started a moment with Doctor Wolf,
02:06:52 people called him the Psychologist of the Fan.
02:06:54 I'm gonna fucking kill myself if I think about
02:06:56 Doctor Wolf for one more second.
02:07:00 Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
02:07:02 Let's go to...

02:07:09 The legendary Eleora.
02:07:12 Girlfriend of the Cult of Personality.
02:07:15 What was his name?
02:07:17 Toon Critic. It's Toon Critic's girlfriend.

02:07:48 Whoa.
02:07:51 Whoa.

02:08:01 It's fucked up.
02:08:03 Okay, good. Okay, good.
02:08:05 Okay, good.
02:08:07 I mean, it's certainly abnormal.
02:08:11 I mean...
02:08:13 Imagine calling yourself Toon Critic in earnest.
02:08:16 Toon Critic Y2K.
02:08:19 Toon Critic Y2K.
02:08:21 Like, if that name...
02:08:23 Like, that's literally the worst name I've ever heard.
02:08:29 It is...
02:08:31 Munchy...
02:08:33 I mean, I make a lot of bold claims.
02:08:37 I make a lot of bold statements.
02:08:39 Sometimes I speak without thinking.
02:08:42 Sometimes I go a little too far.
02:08:45 But let me say to you, in complete earnestness.
02:08:49 In complete...
02:08:51 Yes, in anything.
02:08:53 In complete and utter sincerity, with no hyperbole.
02:09:01 The Toon Critic Y2K is the worst name.
02:09:06 And the worst OC.
02:09:09 The worst design.
02:09:11 The worst human being.
02:09:13 Oh my god.
02:09:16 That has ever existed or ever will exist.
02:09:19 You're stealing his fucking bones.
02:09:21 What? What?
02:09:23 You're stealing his bones again.
02:09:25 You're gonna make silverware out of him.

02:09:29 Look at his... Look at him.
02:09:31 Oh my god. Oh my god.
02:09:33 Like, I don't have to say anything.

02:09:53 Wait, wait.
02:09:55 Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, Munchy.
02:09:57 But there's more.
02:09:59 There's more.
02:10:01 His pony sonan has a name.

02:11:11 What the fuck is with the stripes on his hooves?
02:11:13 Not his hooves, his legs.
02:11:15 What is with the fucking stripes?
02:11:17 They're like...
02:11:19 Is he wearing armbands?
02:11:21 They're like, oh, they're like whisk warmers.
02:11:23 He's got to warm up.
02:11:25 He's got to warm up to bring on the Toon Storm, bro.
02:11:27 Toon Storm!
02:11:31 That's...
02:11:33 impeccable. Good job.
02:11:35 Good job, Toon Critic Light 2K.
02:11:37 This man...
02:11:39 This man...
02:11:45 He really ought to calm a man.
02:11:47 This boy.
02:11:49 He created this.
02:11:51 He might even not even have created himself.
02:11:53 He might have commissioned someone else to make it,
02:11:55 for all we know.
02:11:57 He made this.
02:11:59 This image that we are beholding now.
02:12:01 He looked at that, and he was like,
02:12:03 this is good.
02:12:05 This'll do.
02:12:07 This is how I want...
02:12:09 This will do nicely.
02:12:11 This fits into my...
02:12:13 This fits into my master plan.
02:12:15 I agree with the direction this is taking.
02:12:19 Everything I want to say,
02:12:21 this image says,
02:12:23 will run with it.
02:12:25 I concur, good sir.
02:12:27 I believe in the message of this image.
02:12:29 I believe in it.
02:12:31 Oh god.
02:12:33 Oh my fucking god.
02:12:35 I can't believe it.
02:12:37 I can't believe it.
02:12:39 He's just red and black.
02:12:41 He's just red and black.
02:12:45 He's all different shades of red.
02:12:49 He's all different shades of red.
02:12:53 Okay, okay, okay.
02:12:55 Toon Storm is good.
02:12:57 But the fact that he fancies himself
02:12:59 a charmer.
02:13:01 He fancies himself a charmer.
02:13:03 To the point where he would call himself
02:13:05 a sketch charmer.
02:13:09 There's just...
02:13:11 There's just no end.
02:13:13 There's no end to what I could say
02:13:15 about this guy.
02:13:17 Oh, the bands on his legs are not arm bands
02:13:19 as previously blue pair of stripes.
02:13:21 Oh, thank god.
02:13:23 He looks a little trivia.
02:13:25 He's actually called Flame Amigo.
02:13:27 Oh my god, Flame Amigo.
02:13:29 He must have changed his name.
02:13:31 He must have thought he was muscling in
02:13:33 on Josh Scorcher's territory.
02:13:35 Well, okay, okay.
02:13:37 Josh, let's not even...
02:13:39 Let's not bring up the fucking
02:13:41 the fucking nightmare that is
02:13:43 Josh Scorcher.
02:13:45 I like the fact that he just put
02:13:47 his phone number area code
02:13:49 at the end of his fucking
02:13:51 Flame Amigo.
02:13:53 I think that's what it is.
02:13:55 It has to be.
02:13:57 There's no...
02:13:59 You're just not going to throw around
02:14:01 the number 619.
02:14:03 You're not going to do that.
02:14:05 Is that an area code? I don't know.
02:14:07 That's my area code.
02:14:09 Maybe your neighbors.
02:14:11 Maybe I am him.
02:14:13 Maybe it's like a doctor...
02:14:15 A doctor wolf, a doctor hide
02:14:17 scenario.
02:14:19 Toon Critic has been shipped with many others
02:14:21 besides Ellie, including Golden Fox
02:14:23 and Keyframe.
02:14:25 Oh, Toon broke
02:14:27 up with Ellie sometime in late
02:14:29 2015. Oh man, I'm way behind.
02:14:31 I'm way behind on the Pony Lore.
02:14:33 Holy fuck. Okay, okay, okay.
02:14:35 So what I'm gathering from this is that
02:14:37 they were shipped together because that's
02:14:39 how humans work, I suppose.
02:14:41 Wait, was in a...
02:14:43 Was in a cannon...
02:14:45 This is...
02:14:47 This bullet point is blurring the line
02:14:49 of fantasy and reality so hard for me.
02:14:51 It's so meta
02:14:53 that I can't even wrap my puny little
02:14:55 P-brain around it.
02:14:57 Okay, hold on.
02:14:59 I think by in a cannon
02:15:01 ship they just mean that they were fucking dating
02:15:03 these fucking bastards.
02:15:05 I can't believe she's 31.
02:15:07 Alright, okay.
02:15:09 Excellent.
02:15:11 You know, I think past now
02:15:13 she'll ask my phone number.
02:15:15 No way. Maybe that's why he was
02:15:17 flame-flame-amigo-619.
02:15:19 Maybe he put your
02:15:21 area code. Yeah, maybe.
02:15:23 Look, there's nothing.
02:15:25 There's nothing. There's literally nothing.
02:15:27 There's nothing.
02:15:29 Oh, past analysis.
02:15:31 Why?
02:15:33 I don't know. Was he not good enough
02:15:35 for you people?
02:15:37 Did he not come up with snuff?
02:15:39 Yeah, I mean
02:15:41 for fuck's sake.
02:15:43 You know what it is. Come on. You know, here's
02:15:45 the fucking gets me.
02:15:47 Like, the amount
02:15:49 of information on your fucking
02:15:51 rift cafe wiki entry
02:15:53 is like, it has nothing
02:15:55 to do with
02:15:57 your fucking product.
02:15:59 Like, it's just all about how active
02:16:01 in the community you are.
02:16:03 Like, this is what,
02:16:05 the rift cafe does not exist
02:16:07 for any purpose.
02:16:09 Except for the fucking
02:16:11 rifters, for the rifters
02:16:13 who want to be rifters, who just fucking
02:16:15 circle jerk themselves over
02:16:17 just how fucking important in their own
02:16:19 gay little community they are.
02:16:21 Oh, god. Oh, nothing makes me
02:16:23 nothing makes me matter.
02:16:25 Nothing makes me matter in the pony fucking days.
02:16:27 Jesus Christ, Munchy. Munchy, god.
02:16:29 I'm so fucking, I'm so fucking glad.
02:16:31 I'm so fucking glad I escaped
02:16:33 Munchy. I'm so, I
02:16:35 can't believe it. I didn't, they didn't
02:16:37 all make it out. We have to go back.
02:16:39 No, no, never.
02:16:41 We have to go back. We have to go back.
02:16:43 We have to be like,
02:16:45 we have to be like,
02:16:47 like Plato's allegory of the cave.
02:16:49 You know what I'm saying? No.
02:16:51 Like, we, yes.
02:16:53 We found out there's like an entire other
02:16:55 world outside of this little pond.
02:16:57 Yeah, we went, they're not going to believe us.
02:16:59 No, like, we're gonna,
02:17:01 we're gonna, we're gonna go back
02:17:03 in there and like, and they're just watching,
02:17:05 they're just watching like,
02:17:07 they're little fucking shadow ponies,
02:17:09 and there's like, there's like,
02:17:11 there's like, you know, you can make like,
02:17:13 YouTube videos that aren't like,
02:17:15 a fucking review of
02:17:17 my little pony with your avatar
02:17:19 in the corner and they'd be like,
02:17:21 well, well, well,
02:17:23 well, well, well, where's
02:17:25 my birthday cake?
02:17:27 Well, well,
02:17:29 just stop me. I just don't believe
02:17:31 you. I just don't.
02:17:33 They're just gonna like, they're just gonna like,
02:17:35 confer amongst themselves and like,
02:17:37 no, I think, I think it's better.
02:17:39 I think it's better the way we were doing it.
02:17:41 I think we're really, I think we're really getting
02:17:43 some good results.
02:17:45 Oh, thanks for your input.
02:17:47 She hasn't known
02:17:49 a plea. She notably has
02:17:51 a slight hypocrisy streak.
02:17:53 She has known to despise
02:17:55 puns will quite frequently make them
02:17:57 a slight
02:17:59 hypocrisy streak.
02:18:03 I'm gonna fucking kill whoever wrote this.
02:18:05 I'm gonna fucking murder them.
02:18:07 I hate...
02:18:09 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
02:18:11 She is, she...
02:18:13 She also
02:18:15 tries to stay as fair as possible
02:18:17 in all things and is not above
02:18:19 listening to criticism. She also is
02:18:21 well aware of how attractive slash
02:18:23 cute she is and will occasionally use
02:18:25 this to her advantage. What the fuck?
02:18:27 What is this?
02:18:29 God, what is this
02:18:31 based on? What is it? It's fucking
02:18:33 it's, it's
02:18:35 fucking turtles all the way down.
02:18:37 It's all the way down. Only the turtle
02:18:39 in this metaphor, the turtle is
02:18:41 like some made up bullshit that doesn't even exist.
02:18:43 Mm-hmm.
02:18:45 That's...
02:18:47 Is this relevant?
02:18:49 Is this relevant to anyone?
02:18:53 Ben, we're looking through world
02:18:55 through our rear view.
02:18:59 Was this ever relevant?
02:19:01 I've, I've...
02:19:03 I have no clue.
02:19:05 I want, I want analysis
02:19:07 anarchy to be like a lecturer.
02:19:09 Oh my god, I know what I have to do.
02:19:11 A lecture on analysis anarchy?
02:19:13 Yes, we fucking...
02:19:15 Dude, I've got, I've got, I'm so
02:19:17 I'm so fucking sad.
02:19:19 I'm so fucking sad that I didn't do a second lecture
02:19:21 at Radcon 2. I should have just
02:19:23 on Tails Get Strolled. I should have just
02:19:25 fucking bit the bullet and done Tails Get Strolled.
02:19:27 It would have been great. Everyone would have loved me.
02:19:29 We just need more lectures.
02:19:31 We just, and chief among them needs to be
02:19:33 TF2 analysis anarchy.
02:19:35 Yeah, we need...
02:19:37 I'm very fucking invested in the narrative
02:19:39 of that.
02:19:40 Of analysis anarchy?
02:19:41 Yeah.
02:19:42 Are you gonna...
02:19:43 Are you gonna watch them? Are you gonna watch
02:19:45 all 30 episodes?
02:19:47 I've watched like half of them
02:19:49 before just like, just thinking like
02:19:51 oh my, my, I'm going to
02:19:53 I'm going to lose function of my body.
02:19:55 My body, my soul
02:19:57 I'm going to be able to control my body anymore.
02:19:59 Okay, I want you, I want you to...
02:20:01 Wait, wait, wait, first I want you to appreciate,
02:20:03 I want you to appreciate, ironically
02:20:05 despite her character's very forward
02:20:07 and aggressive demeanor,
02:20:09 Eliora is fairly shy and withdrawn
02:20:11 in real life. Ironically.
02:20:13 Ironically.
02:20:15 Ironically.
02:20:17 Ironically.
02:20:18 Oh my god.
02:20:19 Yeah, that's irony for you.
02:20:20 Okay, okay, okay.
02:20:21 Okay, okay.
02:20:22 Imagine.
02:20:23 I'm, I'm, I'm...
02:20:25 This is long after the pony days.
02:20:27 I'm thinking about TF2
02:20:29 and I think, oh man,
02:20:31 I wonder if there's any like, TF2 analysis
02:20:33 I could watch, you know?
02:20:34 I really, really get in the meat and bones of this game.
02:20:36 Yeah, I miss, I miss, you know,
02:20:38 I'm so behind on the ponies.
02:20:39 I need pony, I need the, the,
02:20:41 I need to be brought up to speed on the ponies
02:20:43 by watching just hours and hours
02:20:46 of analysis.
02:20:48 I need to watch 45 minute analyses
02:20:50 of 20 minute episodes.
02:20:52 Yeah, I just want, I just want
02:20:54 to watch some, some analysis of, of, of TF2.
02:20:57 So let me type in to, to, to YouTube.
02:21:00 TF2 analysis, to, to get some reviews
02:21:03 or urges, just, you know, whatever
02:21:05 analysis of the video game, TF2.
02:21:07 Oh my god.
02:21:08 And then the first thing comes up.
02:21:10 Thumbnail, phantom horn.
02:21:12 No.
02:21:13 As a soldier.
02:21:14 My...
02:21:15 No.
02:21:16 Analysis anarchy, TF2.
02:21:18 No.
02:21:19 I click on it and I have no idea
02:21:21 what the fuck is going on.
02:21:23 Ugh.
02:21:25 Jesus Christ.
02:21:27 I'm so sad.
02:21:29 I'm so fucking sad
02:21:31 that my name is fucking attached to it.
02:21:33 I fucking, I fucking,
02:21:35 when that video came out
02:21:37 and I saw what I had done,
02:21:39 I fucking lost my shit.
02:21:41 It was like, it might be
02:21:43 like the worst I've ever felt about anything
02:21:45 in my entire life.
02:21:47 Jesus Christ.
02:21:48 It's just like, yeah.
02:21:49 When I saw, when I saw the product
02:21:51 that I had fucking hitched my wagon to,
02:21:53 I was like,
02:21:54 oh god, I've made a terrible mistake.
02:21:56 I've made a terrible mistake
02:21:58 and I hate myself.
02:22:00 But hey,
02:22:01 that's the way the cookie comes.
02:22:03 The, the entire like,
02:22:05 that like, just the idea
02:22:07 of that series is fucking
02:22:09 insane.
02:22:10 Like, it's most incoherent
02:22:12 fucking...
02:22:13 It's...
02:22:14 Okay, okay, okay.
02:22:15 It's like, it's like someone just,
02:22:17 it's like some, some idiot,
02:22:19 stupid people were talking
02:22:21 and like,
02:22:22 two of them said,
02:22:23 one of them said like two things
02:22:25 next to each other
02:22:27 and like,
02:22:28 someone else
02:22:29 laughed about it.
02:22:31 And then they all unanimously decided like,
02:22:33 that is a great idea.
02:22:34 We should fucking
02:22:35 get right on it.
02:22:37 And then they just did.
02:22:38 And then they just did.
02:22:40 And then they were like,
02:22:41 this retarded idea that we had,
02:22:43 this retarded thing that someone said,
02:22:45 let's fucking just,
02:22:46 let's fucking make it happen
02:22:48 as necessary.
02:22:49 Let's fucking pool our fucking shitty
02:22:51 Patreon money
02:22:52 and pay some fucking
02:22:54 hack
02:22:55 to make it.
02:22:56 And then,
02:22:57 even though it sucks,
02:22:59 let's keep making it.
02:23:00 Because,
02:23:01 I don't know,
02:23:02 what else are we gonna do?
02:23:04 Oh god.
02:23:05 It's, it's, it's,
02:23:07 okay, it's like,
02:23:08 it's like a fan fiction
02:23:10 of these, these avatars,
02:23:12 these pony sonas.
02:23:14 Oh yeah, that's right.
02:23:15 These pony sonas.
02:23:16 It's crossover fan fiction
02:23:18 of O.C.'s,
02:23:20 of a whole other fucking franchise.
02:23:23 Yeah.
02:23:24 Inside
02:23:26 of a,
02:23:27 a modified version
02:23:29 of the Team Fortress 2
02:23:31 map coal town,
02:23:33 for some reason,
02:23:35 these ponies have formed a
02:23:37 Team Fortress 2 team,
02:23:39 MVM,
02:23:40 Team Fortress 2 team.
02:23:42 And during the fight with robots,
02:23:44 they, they, they engage
02:23:46 in, in relationship scuffles.
02:23:48 One of which.
02:23:49 Scuffles!
02:23:51 One, the, the, the main focus of,
02:23:53 and, and, and one, one includes
02:23:56 the, the relationship of Joss Scorcher
02:23:58 and Ink Rose,
02:24:00 uh, Ink Rose being 16,
02:24:02 and J, I, I believe at least,
02:24:04 and, and Joss Scorcher being like
02:24:06 28, right?
02:24:07 I think he was like 22.
02:24:10 Okay.
02:24:11 It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's better.
02:24:13 Yeah.
02:24:14 You know, in hindsight,
02:24:15 I got really mad about like the age
02:24:17 thing in hindsight.
02:24:19 I wish I hadn't cause like who gives
02:24:21 a shit.
02:24:22 I was, I was really just mad that I,
02:24:24 they had made this terrible video and
02:24:26 I hated it.
02:24:27 That's, that was my real problem.
02:24:29 Um, yeah.
02:24:30 Um, if I, if I,
02:24:34 put me in a room,
02:24:36 put me in a room
02:24:38 with a gun
02:24:39 and just one bullet,
02:24:42 and then put in front of me
02:24:44 Dr. Wolf,
02:24:46 Joss Scorcher,
02:24:48 and Digi Bro.
02:24:50 And, and, and, and it'll be the most
02:24:53 difficult decision of my life,
02:24:55 the most difficult decision I've ever
02:24:57 had to make.
02:24:58 Um,
02:24:59 but someone's going to die.
02:25:01 Do, do you like
02:25:03 that Digi has
02:25:05 barely anything on his
02:25:07 fucking profile?
02:25:09 Like, like, barely anything.
02:25:11 Oh, on the, on the wiki?
02:25:13 Yeah.
02:25:16 What?
02:25:17 Look.
02:25:18 Even though he fucking,
02:25:19 he fucking made
02:25:21 like a backstory and shit.
02:25:23 Like he has, like he has,
02:25:25 he has his info out there,
02:25:27 his fucking character.
02:25:28 His character had a backstory.
02:25:29 Will no one create
02:25:30 MOP analysis videos.
02:25:32 Uh, uh, upload schedule none.
02:25:36 Oh my god, that's fanart by the
02:25:38 Burning Donut.
02:25:39 I fucking hate the Burning Donut.
02:25:41 I hate that guy.
02:25:42 Why do you hate the Burning Donut?
02:25:43 Who's that?
02:25:44 He's this piece of absolute ass.
02:25:46 Oh my god,
02:25:48 the fucking Burning Donut.
02:25:49 See, Monchi,
02:25:51 let, let me, let me go,
02:25:53 let me take this opportunity to go on a
02:25:55 bizarre and pointless tangent about
02:25:57 my feelings for a minute.
02:25:58 Oh my fucking god.
02:26:00 Yeah, alright.
02:26:02 See, see,
02:26:04 yeah.
02:26:06 Yeah.
02:26:08 I mean,
02:26:10 there's a lot, there's a lot going on here.
02:26:12 Um, the,
02:26:14 see, alright.
02:26:15 I couldn't, I couldn't draw that well for a
02:26:17 long time.
02:26:18 I could like sort of draw a little bit,
02:26:19 like my whole life.
02:26:20 Um,
02:26:21 but I'm a,
02:26:22 not to toot my own horn,
02:26:23 but I'm a real smart guy.
02:26:25 I'm the smartest guy in the fucking universe.
02:26:27 I'm literally the smartest person who ever lived.
02:26:29 Yeah, sure, of course.
02:26:30 And that's, that's true.
02:26:31 That's God's honest truth.
02:26:32 And um,
02:26:34 uh,
02:26:35 and I fucking,
02:26:37 and I learned and I learned how to draw
02:26:39 and I think I did it
02:26:41 because I'm really smart.
02:26:43 Like I think that the fact that I'm fucking smart
02:26:45 had something to do with my ability
02:26:47 to fucking become capable
02:26:49 of producing
02:26:51 grave and images in defiance
02:26:53 of, in defiance of God's law.
02:26:55 Um, anyway,
02:26:57 so all that, that being said,
02:26:59 when I meet someone who can kind of draw,
02:27:01 but who's like
02:27:03 fucking stupid, it like baffles me.
02:27:05 Like, I can't understand
02:27:07 how someone can be stupid
02:27:09 and also like,
02:27:11 can be like a,
02:27:13 like a competent artist.
02:27:15 And the Burning Donut is, is one of these people,
02:27:17 like he's so dumb,
02:27:19 like he's fucking incoherent.
02:27:21 He's, he's, he's like,
02:27:23 I've talked to him once or twice and he just has no fucking clue
02:27:25 what he's doing at any given time.
02:27:27 And yet, and yet he produces
02:27:29 on a somewhat regular schedule
02:27:31 some pretty, some pretty okay,
02:27:33 some more or less competent
02:27:35 fucking sexy
02:27:37 Anthropony pinups.
02:27:39 I mean, I mean,
02:27:41 look at this picture of Trixie right here.
02:27:43 Okay, like the anatomy
02:27:45 is competent, the figure is fine,
02:27:47 um, the lighting is inept,
02:27:49 the lighting is inept because she should be
02:27:51 illuminated by her sparkles and yet she's
02:27:53 weirdly in shadow, so like it kind of
02:27:55 sucks, but like whatever.
02:27:57 Um, I don't know, and he's just
02:27:59 anyway, anyway, I've talked to this guy,
02:28:01 this, this guy contacted me one time
02:28:03 and he asked me like
02:28:05 Ben, how do I
02:28:07 fucking make my Patreon
02:28:09 succeed? And I was like
02:28:11 well, let me have a look at your Patreon
02:28:13 and I looked at it and it was like
02:28:15 this wall of text
02:28:17 with no, there was, it was like
02:28:19 it was like a, it was like no punctuation,
02:28:21 it was like misspelled, it was like a piece of shit,
02:28:23 it had, it was just sort of this fucking ramble.
02:28:25 It was just this pointless ramble
02:28:27 about how bad, about how much he wants
02:28:29 to make art. And I was like
02:28:31 listen guy, listen guy,
02:28:33 what you need to do, like this is
02:28:35 aimless, like you need to like offer awards,
02:28:37 you know, you need to like,
02:28:39 you need to like say in your Patreon
02:28:41 like what you're actually doing, because his
02:28:43 Patreon was like, pledge to my Patreon
02:28:45 and if I make,
02:28:47 if I hit like $500 a month,
02:28:49 then maybe
02:28:51 I'll start drawing a comic.
02:28:53 And I was like
02:28:55 listen you, you stupid bastard,
02:28:57 like you gotta just start doing it
02:28:59 and be like, here I'm doing this
02:29:01 comic, if you like it
02:29:03 and wanna support it, pledge to my Patreon.
02:29:05 You can't be like, if I make money
02:29:07 then I'll start doing a thing
02:29:09 because nobody is gonna want
02:29:11 to support you. And he just
02:29:13 fucking, like I told him all that
02:29:15 and I gave him my advice and he was like thanks
02:29:17 and then he went and like didn't listen to any of it.
02:29:19 He like, he cleaned up the
02:29:21 text on his Patreon but he didn't like
02:29:23 he didn't like actually fix any of the problems.
02:29:25 His fucking
02:29:27 his fucking reward, like his highest reward
02:29:29 tier is like $50 a month or something
02:29:31 and if you pledge $50 a month it's like
02:29:33 you will literally become a part
02:29:35 of the creative process of making my
02:29:37 comic. So it's basically like
02:29:39 you'll write my comic for me.
02:29:41 Like, is what it is.
02:29:43 Anyway, I don't know.
02:29:45 Sorry, that was a big, that was a big pointless
02:29:47 aggression but I just think the burning donut
02:29:49 he just pisses me off especially
02:29:51 and he just represents a lot of what I think
02:29:53 is the worst fucking instincts
02:29:55 and a lot of lazy, shiftless artists out
02:29:57 there. And the worst fucking
02:29:59 part is that he makes like $50 a month
02:30:01 on Patreon. I don't fucking know why.
02:30:03 I guess it's because he makes fucking pony
02:30:05 pinups for fucking KFC's
02:30:07 sex sluts to jack their little
02:30:09 fucking KFC. Their little dicks too.
02:30:11 Listening to
02:30:13 suicidal tendencies
02:30:15 reading
02:30:17 watching Kill La Kill
02:30:19 playing no systems
02:30:21 eating whatever
02:30:23 I can afford on food stamps
02:30:25 drinking NOS
02:30:27 I don't even know what NOS is. Is it a beverage?
02:30:29 Oh, okay.
02:30:31 The idea of listening to
02:30:33 suicidal tendencies
02:30:35 and watching Kill La Kill
02:30:37 and eating whatever I can afford
02:30:39 on food stamps
02:30:41 I really think
02:30:43 this guy
02:30:45 is the next step of human evolution
02:30:47 evolution.
02:30:49 This is what I want us all to become.
02:30:51 He obviously
02:30:53 fares well in all sorts of situations.
02:30:55 He obviously
02:30:57 is able to
02:30:59 climb through the ranks.
02:31:01 He is fucking
02:31:03 poor
02:31:05 and I feel that
02:31:07 this is what he deserves.
02:31:11 Excellent. Very...
02:31:13 for 12 years.
02:31:15 I just, I just, man
02:31:19 and this is
02:31:21 Digi Brony's legacy.
02:31:23 Digi Brony's legacy is a
02:31:25 fucking piece of fan art by the burning
02:31:27 doughnut. It's a holy
02:31:29 chain.
02:31:33 Oh my god.
02:31:37 He is a ship with Tommy Oliver.
02:31:39 He's one of the first and most popular
02:31:41 shipments in the Brony analysis community.
02:31:43 Really it's not because nobody fucking
02:31:45 wrote in any of his information.
02:31:47 Wait, does Tommy Oliver have a page?
02:31:49 Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to find one.
02:31:51 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:31:55 Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,
02:31:57 okay, okay, okay.
02:31:59 Oh god. Oh yeah!
02:32:01 Look at that.
02:32:03 He's ship with Digi Bros.
02:32:05 when the first one was pop-thrush.
02:32:07 Oh yes.
02:32:09 Tommy is openly bisect...
02:32:11 Wait, does Vita have a fucking
02:32:13 page?
02:32:15 Wait, wait.
02:32:17 Who's Vita breakfast?
02:32:19 Oh my god!
02:32:21 Why?
02:32:23 Why?
02:32:25 Oh
02:32:27 This is why.
02:32:29 This is why people like Vita exist
02:32:31 because fucking idiots,
02:32:33 fucking idiots will catalog all their
02:32:35 fucking misanthropic
02:32:37 sociopathy here.
02:32:39 This is why scumbags like Vita
02:32:41 and Cream Man fucking do their shit
02:32:43 and love it.
02:32:45 Oh my fucking god.
02:32:47 Oh Christ, this is a fucking trap seat.
02:32:49 Can we fucking go in?
02:32:51 This page is a mix of jokes and
02:32:53 facts.
02:32:55 How can we fucking nuke?
02:32:57 Can we fucking nuke the Rift Cafe?
02:32:59 No, I'm fucking going to the Rift Cafe
02:33:01 right fucking now and I'm deleting
02:33:03 Vita's page and I'm probably gonna delete
02:33:05 like it does in other pages.
02:33:07 Why fucking nuke? It's a public wiki.
02:33:09 I can do anything I want.
02:33:11 Just gonna roll it back.
02:33:13 No one will notice.
02:33:15 Nobody gives a shit.
02:33:19 I'm like...
02:33:21 What?
02:33:23 What?
02:33:25 One of the most
02:33:27 likable veterans of the Rift
02:33:29 is how it begins.
02:33:31 Edit.
02:33:33 Classic editor.
02:33:35 Let's see.
02:33:37 Let's see.

02:33:45 301 subscribers.
02:33:47 Wait, where?
02:33:49 Where does it say that?
02:33:51 On the fucking Rift Cafe.
02:33:53 That's 301.
02:33:55 Astounding.
02:33:57 Why N1?
02:33:59 Why not just whatever?
02:34:01 How do I delete it?
02:34:03 Shouldn't there just be a fucking delete button?
02:34:07 I don't know.
02:34:09 Hey, hey, hey.
02:34:11 Fucking bitch.
02:34:15 Listen to me.
02:34:17 I need your help.
02:34:19 I need your help to erase Vita's legacy.
02:34:21 They have his Skype.
02:34:23 His Skype? Oh, all I want to do is just
02:34:25 contact him.
02:34:27 Ugh.
02:34:31 Let's go to this YouTube, shall we?
02:34:35 Yes.
02:34:37 He's still using the avatar I made him.
02:34:39 Where? Let me see, let me see.
02:34:41 On his YouTube.
02:34:45 I can't believe this.
02:34:47 Oh, he's all the way up to
02:34:49 399 subscribers.
02:34:51 Oh my god.
02:34:53 In like the two years since then.
02:34:55 He's posted, he posted one week ago.
02:34:57 He's, oh wait, wait, wait.
02:34:59 Okay, but he didn't post for seven months
02:35:01 before that.
02:35:05 What's he doing?
02:35:07 The fuck is he doing? I don't know what these videos are.
02:35:09 Oh, he's got a little fucking
02:35:11 video of him with a keyframe.
02:35:13 Keyframe and puzzle. Oh, keyframe.
02:35:15 Fucking keyframe.
02:35:17 Let's fucking talk about keyframe.
02:35:19 Just some fucking girl.
02:35:21 Just some useless girl
02:35:23 who comes in with nothing.
02:35:25 Some KFC sex life.
02:35:27 Some KFC sex life. She comes in
02:35:29 with like one drawing
02:35:31 of an OC. She comes in
02:35:33 she's there for like a week
02:35:35 she makes like one video
02:35:37 and then on with the waterworks
02:35:39 on with the fucking oh no

02:35:43 and my family is abusing me
02:35:45 and oh no my life is
02:35:47 ruined. Oh, somebody help me

02:35:51 a dozen people pledge to her patreon
02:35:53 get her like I don't know like a hundred bucks a month
02:35:55 or something and probably they fucking
02:35:57 give her money to like I don't know
02:35:59 she's got a bunch of money and now she's
02:36:01 been for a while, for a while

02:36:17 reason which I find pretty
02:36:19 that is odd. That is

02:36:25 of being real. I don't

02:45:33 ineptly delivered
02:45:35 and and ineptly
02:45:37 consumed. Like even, even the viewers, like even the viewing experience is just, it just
02:45:47 couldn't happen. It couldn't be the way it is if it wasn't, just the viewers just have
02:45:55 to be retarded. Like they just have to be retarded. Like everyone, I'm sorry. No I'm
02:46:00 not sorry. Fuck me I'm not sorry. Everyone who watches Kim Possible, or has ever watched
02:46:06 a Kim Possible a lot, has to be retarded. There's no other explanation. You wouldn't,
02:46:12 you wouldn't do it. You wouldn't do it if you weren't retarded. You just wouldn't do
02:46:18 it.
02:46:19 Look, look, look, look recent wiki activity from, from a fandom user on Fee, what, what,
02:46:25 oh my god.
02:46:26 Wait.
02:46:27 It's god.
02:46:28 Wait, I'm gonna, you know what I have to do, you know what I have to do? I have to go
02:46:32 in and make like a couple minor changes just to like get that change off of like the most
02:46:36 recent changes list.
02:46:39 Oh my god.
02:46:40 Like, yeah.
02:46:41 Like that's what I, that's what I have to do.
02:46:42 Let's, let's, let's look at some of these guys. They're, they're up and coming. Who's
02:46:48 wooden sword?
02:46:49 Up and, uh, some up and comers, some fucking up and comers in the pony analysis community.
02:46:55 Age 15.
02:46:56 Age 15.
02:46:57 Oh.
02:46:58 Age 15.
02:46:59 Oh, look at, look at that fucking, look at that fucking, uh, avatar. Um, that is a striking,
02:47:06 that is a striking character design.
02:47:08 It's bold.
02:47:09 Yeah.
02:47:10 It's bold.
02:47:11 Memorable. It's gonna stick with me till the day I fucking die, which is today, said
02:47:14 Ben, cocking his gun.
02:47:16 He was devastated when he heard Club Penguin was shut down. It still haunts him to this
02:47:20 day.
02:47:21 It was shut down like a month ago.
02:47:22 It still haunts him to this day, even though it was like, like two weeks ago.
02:47:26 To date, he is the only person in the 2010s to care about Club Penguin. That's not fucking
02:47:32 true, dude.
02:47:34 What about Gibbo?
02:47:35 I, I, I, if, okay, I want to see if he's like, I'm sorry, go back for one second. Go back
02:47:41 for 77 subscribers, 77 subscribers. Um, what, okay, how's this for fucking characterization?
02:47:48 Wooden sword often complains that because he is in Australia, he's always late to Skype
02:47:52 conversations and podcasts since by the time he arrives, everyone is getting ready for
02:47:57 bed.
02:47:58 Everyone is getting ready for bed. Deep, deep lore, deep characterization, important shit.
02:48:04 Shoot me.
02:48:05 Um, okay, okay. I, I, okay, I'm assuming he's gonna have a video about the end of Club
02:48:09 Penguin. And if it has more than Hippo's video, I'm, no, he's got 77, he's got 77 subscribers.
02:48:18 This is not, this is not a true up and comer.
02:48:21 Okay.
02:48:22 15.
02:48:23 What?
02:48:24 15, lol.
02:48:25 God, what, what kind of fucking retards we associate with a 15 year old?
02:48:31 Hard to imagine. Hard to imagine, really.
02:48:35 Ooh, you have to be retarded.
02:48:39 Uh, wait, uh, I love Kim Possible a lot. Trivia. For her 3,000 subscriber special in which it's
02:48:48 traditional to sing winter wrap up, KP saying traditional or wait, wait, it's, it's traditional
02:48:56 to sing winter wrap up or some other MLP related song, KP saying discord instead of winter
02:49:02 wrap up. Okay. I have many questions. One, since when was it traditional to do anything
02:49:06 for 3,000 subscribers? Since when was it traditional to sing winter wrap up? And what
02:49:11 is the point of saying traditional to sing winter wrap up or some other MLP related song?
02:49:16 Why not just say it's traditional to sing an MLP related song? Even though it isn't
02:49:20 and there are no traditions and this is all just a bunch of made up bullshit. It's all
02:49:24 just a bunch of bullshit from the top down.
02:49:27 Okay. Okay. Okay. We have so many.
02:49:34 Wait, wait, wait. His talents include editing, humor, analysis kind of, and annoying other
02:49:40 ponies intentional or otherwise. He takes inspiration.
02:49:44 He takes inspiration from Cat Icarus, Pina Fina Gala, Zondron, and Space Hamster, etc.
02:49:53 That's, imagine, imagine boldly stating you take inspiration from Cat Icarus and Pina
02:50:00 Butter Gamer, the most, the most original, the most bold, the most, the boldest faces
02:50:07 on the internet today.
02:50:09 Oh, you know, you know, you, you, you, you, you. Okay. Oh, my God. You know how it's canon.
02:50:15 It's canon that there exists the ICPCP that is a juggalo, a juggalo, a alter ego of everyone
02:50:23 in the PCP. You know, you know, that's a thing, right?
02:50:25 I mean, I know about the Japanese juggalo. That's about. The Japanese juggalo is Digi's
02:50:31 ICPCP counterpart. I honestly, I have not heard of the ICPCP.
02:50:36 Okay. The ICPCP is real. Okay. And if this guy liked clowns, he would be my, he would
02:50:44 be my ICPCP.
02:50:46 Really? Yeah. Yeah. Cause he's, he's everything. He's like, cause he's just a baby. He's just
02:50:52 like me if I was shitty. He's just a baby boy, just like you.
02:50:55 He's just a baby. Look at all his friends. Oh, Pet O Pat Rex 11, Mr. Left Turn, Martyr
02:51:02 Boy, uh, uh, Onyx the Dragon, Game Link Reviews, Doodled Pony and Freedom Flash, you know,
02:51:09 all the greats. Although a bunch of nonsense, he often jokes about being horse famous in
02:51:16 his videos. Wow. What a, what a concept. What a fucking original, uh, you know, I don't
02:51:25 even have a problem. I don't have a problem with this guy cause he's a kid. Like I'm not
02:51:30 blaming him. I'm not blaming him for being terrible and being useless and for him being
02:51:35 worthless and for his content being shit. I'm not blaming him for any of that. I'm blaming
02:51:40 whoever wrote this wiki article for feeling that this was a worthwhile thing to catalog.
02:51:46 You know what? No. You know what? It's probably him. He probably just wrote it about himself.
02:51:50 Yeah. I was just about to say, I guarantee you that he wrote this myself.
02:51:53 Okay. So it's fine. In that case, it's fine. You know what? That's, that's why Pete, that's
02:51:57 why like me and Digi don't have any fucking thing on our fucking wiki page. Just cause
02:52:01 we didn't give enough of a shit to go in and write our own fucking articles. Yeah. That's,
02:52:06 that's the solution. That's, that's the justice. People in the PCP fan chat, please fucking make
02:52:11 the wiki, please work. Yeah. Please. Like mine's fine. Mine's okay. I mean, it could
02:52:18 be better. Mine's literally just, lol. Ugh. Now mine's, mine's, mine's alright. I think
02:52:25 I did okay, but like, yeah, mages is like a sentence long. Yeah. Why isn't fucking phantom
02:52:34 horn in the transgender pain? His gender is, his gender is unicorn, dude. He's a, his gender
02:52:41 is trans unicorn. Oh, I'm weak. Oh, I'm weak with rage. Okay. Okay. Undefined gender. Okay.
02:52:54 What the fuck? What do you mean, undefined gender? He's a fucking girl. Whatever. Whatever,
02:53:00 man. Okay. Okay. There's literally nothing in non-fucking. Even though fucking the other
02:53:04 ones are both, ugh. I like how that one's just human. Oh, it's maluminous. That's. Who?
02:53:13 Yeah. That, that fucker. Who? Who? Wait, wait, I, it was, she, I talked to what's his name.
02:53:19 It's also, it's a, it's a guy. It's a trans girl. It's a male. So that's, so that's,
02:53:23 so that's, so that's bullshit. It's a girl. That's bullshit. Well, I guess, I guess it
02:53:27 is under literally female. Yeah, they're, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ahhhh! Look at the, look,
02:53:35 look at this face. Hmm. Yes. The brony gallery. He takes, he takes an in-depth look at a particular
02:53:44 artist on DeviantArt. Currently, she's only done two episodes of the series, but plans
02:53:48 to work. Good. Yeah. Your Patreon dollars at work, everybody. I don't know why I'm so
02:53:54 mad. I don't know why I'm so mad. This person makes like a hundred dollars. This person
02:53:58 makes like, this person makes like a hundred dollars on Patreon, which is not that much
02:54:02 in the grand scheme of things, but there's so many better people. There's like talent,
02:54:06 there's like talented fucking people out there that make like thirty dollars a month on Patreon.
02:54:11 And, oh god, I just want to throw up just thinking about the fucking iniquity of this
02:54:15 world. Keyframe is also a talented artist. Shut your fucking mouth. I want to die. Look, look. I want to
02:54:29 look at. God, just remembering, remembering when I made less on Patreon than Keyframe.
02:54:35 Those were dark days. Those were dark fucking days. Look, look, look, look, look. Jesus. Look at
02:54:46 this. Look. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. It's fine. I mean, I've seen, after all the horrors I've
02:54:52 seen today, this is fine. This is okay. The iPod. Oh, oh wait. I just, oh yeah, I just realized
02:55:00 it's an iPod. iPod. That's good. That's good shit. That's good shit. Don't they have fucking,
02:55:08 don't they have fucking Samsung's in Ponyville? That's my question for you, my friend. Oh,
02:55:15 he's my age. Oh no, he's slightly younger than me, but he's, this is, I'm sure this is out of date,
02:55:20 so he's probably my age. Yeah, probably. He's, hmm. What a fucking hack. Who's, who's, who's,
02:55:30 who's, who's another guy? Digi. We, we've already seen this. He's the only one I know. Yeah,
02:55:39 let's answer what made, let's see what's going on with me. Oh fuck Mad Munchkin. Oh, okay. You're
02:55:43 at Lethal Rormage. Nothing. Wow. Okay, well, there's a couple of things here. Yeah, Lethal
02:55:54 Halloween, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Why,
02:56:01 why is all of the people for the, for the horseshoe crew literally like they just don't have any?
02:56:07 Um, is there a reason for that? Um, well, what about, what about Jesse? Oh, go to fucking Jesse.
02:56:13 Oh my. I'll bet he's gonna have nothing to, I'll bet he's just gonna. Oh my god. Yeah, he's, yeah,
02:56:21 it's gonna be bad. It's gonna be real bad. I, prepare to get mad. I'm mad already. One, two, three.
02:56:28 Oh, my. Yeah. Oh, it's my. Oh, hell yeah, bro. Oh, I'm hit with a tidal wave. A tidal wave of
02:56:45 what? Nostalgia? Like, man, holy shit. This is shit, bro. Fucking sick, fucking sick, bro. Okay,
02:56:57 first of all, the fact that it, like, for some reason has this, which I, like, I, like, like,
02:57:03 like, this was the first piece of fan art, I think he got, pretty sure, please. Yeah. Was it, was it
02:57:10 really? It was made, like, 45 minutes after the first episode of, of, of his fucking thing came out.
02:57:17 Uh, impressive. So it must be. Yeah. Possibly. You know, I fucking, I sent him another image that
02:57:31 he used, like, the basis of, of, of, of, like, one of his videos. It was, it was some, like,
02:57:35 thing where he and Digi are the fucking retarded, like, Muppets old people thing, right? Yeah,
02:57:40 yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. And that, I remember that. That mother fucker didn't even mention me in the
02:57:46 description. Who? Wait, Jesse or Digi? Jesse. Yeah, Jesse. Can't. Well, fuck him. I'll never
02:57:53 forgive him. I'll never forgive him. I wouldn't. A bunch of bullshit. Who's gay as hell? That's
02:57:59 frankly, frankly, that's gay as hell. It was the only word for it. Um, fucking credit your, credit
02:58:06 your artists, credit your artists people. Um, Jesus. Jesus Christ. Mad, mad munchkin. I hate mad
02:58:14 munchkin. I hate mad munchkin. A fellow munchy. Don't ever touch her hat. She said don't ever touch
02:58:22 her ass. Her hat. Don't. Oh, is that, is that her character that she gets mad if you touch her
02:58:28 hat? Quirky. Just kill me, munchy. Just fucking kill me. One time she encountered Mary Sue, a
02:58:34 parody of the Mary Sue is generally found in the MLP fandom. Oh boy. What a fucking load of bullshit.
02:58:44 Hey, you know what? These people are so fucking old. What? This is another, this is another person who,
02:58:50 this is another person who like, like keyframe because she had like a sad tear jerky like, oh,
02:58:58 I feel so bad for myself. Fucking a moment with Dr. Wolfe. I'm pretty sure this person got like,
02:59:04 I don't know, some fucking money out of it too or something. Maybe not a Patreon or something.
02:59:10 Oh, yeah, Indiegogo. Let's fucking see. Let's fucking see because fucking Dr. Wolfe,
02:59:14 fucking Dr. Wolfe plugged her or something. She got $5,000, wants to raise money for local
02:59:22 charities and expand the business. What a bunch of bullshit. What a bunch of fucking bullshit.
02:59:27 Imagine, hold on. Imagine, okay, imagine this actually being successful. The phrase
02:59:34 wants to raise money for local charities and expand the business. What does that even mean?
02:59:41 What does that even mean? What business? What business? Local charity. Fundraiser to support
02:59:51 business and local charities. Raise money to put back into my local community. Oh my god.
02:59:59 Expanding the business itself. Okay, so what this means is that this is money that's going to her
03:00:06 that she can buy things with. Local things. What, like, what charities and support? I have the
03:00:15 means, I have the means. You know what this is? You know what this is? Oh my god. I'll tell you
03:00:21 exactly what this is. This is just, like, I buy things and I give to charity. So just fucking
03:00:31 give me money and eventually it will go into my local economy and the charities that I support
03:00:37 already. Can you imagine a more blatant, like, just give me money? I actually think this is more
03:00:47 disgusting because this is basically like mask, this is like masquerading as a charity, but really
03:00:52 it's just give me money to spend how I see fit. And then because fucking Dr. Wolf plugged her,
03:00:58 she made $5,000. How fucking Jesus Christ. What kind of person do you have to be?
03:01:08 Thanks for reading. Stay creative. Oh, each shit. Oh, each shit. You know what? Her art
03:01:15 fucking sucks and I hate it. It's a terrible style. It's ugly. It's stupid. She's worthless.
03:01:20 I haven't seen. Fucking look at it. It looks like garbage. I hate it. It's not good. It's not good.
03:01:26 It's not even close to good. It's far from good. It's weak. You're gonna kick off. It's weak and
03:01:34 she's wearing, you know what, you know what that is? You know what that is in her stupid head?
03:01:37 It's the webcomic artist hat. It's the hat that all webcomic artists are legally obligated to wear.
03:01:43 You're not fucking wrong. You know what the worst part about it is is that's a big hat too.
03:01:51 It's not a tiny hat. She's disrespecting the munchie name.
03:01:55 Disgusting. Who fucking, the guy who makes Dresden Kodak wears that hat. The girl awkward zombie
03:02:04 wears that hat. Brony Curious wears that hat. Brony Curious wears a much worse hat.
03:02:10 Yeah. I don't know. There's a bunch more that wear that same stupid hat.
03:02:16 Look at this. It's just like shorthand for I draw a webcomic.
03:02:22 Look at this. That's fucking creativity at work, Boyo.
03:02:29 This is literally just Rainbow Dash. This is Rainbow Dash with a shirt on and you change the color
03:02:36 and you tried to fucking screw with like the line work a little bit on the bottom but you
03:02:41 fucked up and it looks like garbage. This is, oh my god. She's a fan of Doctor Who,
03:02:49 Gravity Falls, anime and other anime shows. It's just Phineas and a Fur, Dexter's Laboratory and the
03:02:55 Powerpuff Girls. You know what, I'm thinking that maybe we need to fucking split this into two
03:03:00 rowdy fuckers copkilling. I'm thinking we've spent, we've spent like as much time jerking our dicks
03:03:07 off about how much we hate the bro analysis community as we have been playing Frog Fractions.
03:03:13 Okay, okay, Ben. You have to like make no fucking illusions to like, that's what this is going to
03:03:19 turn into. It just turns into us fucking going down memory lane. Did you say, oh yeah, we have a lot
03:03:25 to say about Frog Fractions. A lot to say about Frog Fractions. We have many video game opinions.
03:03:31 Also, Enoch144 on Steam, Buy Me Grow Up, Buy Me Glittermitten Grove, Buy Me Grow Up, Buy Me Glittermitten
03:03:41 Grove please. Glittermitten, fucking Mad Munchkin, fucking Mad Munchkin can make $5,000 on Indiegogo
03:03:47 for literally nothing. I'm sure someone, I'm sure some generous person will buy me Grow Up and or
03:03:53 Glittermitten Grove please. Thank you. I love you. Does this person still watch the show? Who?
03:04:00 Dear Cotton Candy. Dear Cotton Candy? Did she ever, did she ever watch Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers?
03:04:08 Oh, well, I just, oh yeah, I guess you're right. I guess like the thumbnail of Rowdy Fuckers Cop Killers
03:04:13 like is a natural deterrent. Yeah, well, against the weak-minded. Yeah. Yeah. In other words, females.
03:04:21 In other words, females. This is, this is, it's a girl repellent and I mean that in the best possible
03:04:25 way. Oh God. Oh my God. That bright acid green just like, they're like, oh, it's like, it's like a
03:04:33 citronella candle and they're like the mosquito. It's like way too potent for their fucking, their,
03:04:39 their, their weak and their, their weak and bland heart to handle. Yeah. Yeah. Um, what were you
03:04:45 saying about CC? Oh, nothing. I'll never say it. Okay, good. Kimmy Sparkle, the only fucking,
03:04:54 the only good one. Oh, wait, wait, was, oh, were you on CC's page? Is that what it was? I wasn't
03:04:59 looking. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Um, yeah, I love Kimmy Sparkle. I love Kimmy Sparkle so much.
03:05:06 Kimmy Sparkle is actually the best thing that ever happened in MLP. Like, fucking,
03:05:11 it's so good. It's so fucking good. Somebody, Munchy. Yeah. Kimmy Sparkle is like the, it's
03:05:20 like the best idea. It's like the most, it's like such an obvious idea. Like when I saw Kimmy Sparkle,
03:05:25 I was like, somebody had to do this and I'm so glad they did. Yeah. How was she the only one?
03:05:33 Uh, I think, I think we, I thought, I think it was just too cool that everyone embroiled in it.
03:05:40 It was just too cool. Like no one wanted to, to even think about the fact that, that it wasn't
03:05:47 incredibly great. Like it was, it was just the best, the best thing. The thing, the thing about,
03:05:53 are you talking about brony analysis? Are you talking about Kimmy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's
03:05:57 a brony analysis. See, here's what fucking kills me. Is that like, what fuck, what kills me
03:06:02 about Kimmy Sparkle is that at some point in there, Kimmy Sparkle was like collabing with people.
03:06:08 Like, uh, not Eliora, um, like Persian Poetus, right? Like she had like a crossover video with
03:06:15 Persian Poetus and a couple other people. But the thing is that like all the other, all the people
03:06:22 that they, she crossed over with, like, like treated it seriously. Like, like they made like
03:06:28 serious, like they treated Kimmy Sparkle as though she was like an actual person and like an actual
03:06:33 personality and not a fucking parody of them. Yeah. Like, I don't know, man. I just, it was
03:06:43 so good. How was there not more? How was that? I just, I wish there had been, I wish there had
03:06:48 been more Kimmy Sparkles, but like on the other hand, I guess that like the fact that there was
03:06:53 only one just speaks, just speaks to how much we fucking needed her. And then she made like four
03:07:01 videos and then fell off the map and that was sad. But like, she was just too good. She was the hero
03:07:07 we needed, but not the one we deserved. We definitely did not deserve her. We definitely did not deserve
03:07:12 Kimmy and she was not appreciated enough. And I guess that's why she left. She was too good for
03:07:19 us. Kimmy Sparkle is the special quote unquote self-proclaimed only Pegasus reviewer. However,
03:07:25 this is false because there are many more, including keyframe. I love Composibla and Eliora.
03:07:33 Ah, the three big, the three, the three Titans. Her creator is none other than Shirt Club Palms.
03:07:40 Kill me. Just fucking kill me. Who, who's this? Oh my God, this one, this fucking one, this fucking
03:07:51 one kills me. Okay, let me fucking tell you, I know, I don't even need to read. She's 30 years old,
03:07:56 by the way. I don't need to read. I don't need to read anything about this person. Here's all I have
03:08:04 to say about Lightning Bliss. Lightning Bliss had a moment with Dr. Wolfe and the issue,
03:08:14 the issue that Lightning Bliss was grappling with, that she needed the doctor's help with, was
03:08:21 the problem of having people, the problem of people judging her for having an alicorn OC.
03:08:33 Holy shit. Yeah, fucking unpack that for a minute. Unpack, unpack the astounding,
03:08:41 the astounding absence of self-awareness that would have to, that would have to have occurred,
03:08:48 that would have to exist, the chain, just the unbroken, the unbroken chain of failure to recognize,
03:08:55 to fucking step outside yourself for one fucking second and understand your place in the world
03:09:00 and what you truly are, that would lead up to that occurring, that would lead up to a video of a
03:09:07 moment with Dr. Wolfe, fucking people are bullied, people judge me for having an alicorn OC, but
03:09:13 I'm not going to take it anymore. Fuck. Dr. Wolfe has to help her through it. Yeah, she had, this is
03:09:20 an issue that she fucking grapples with and she, she can't, oh my Christ. There's just nothing,
03:09:28 there's just nothing she can do, there's just nothing, there's nothing, there's, she's being,
03:09:34 she's just the victim of an unwarranted cyber bullying. Yeah, people don't understand,
03:09:40 the problem is that people don't understand the creative vision behind her OC. If they did,
03:09:48 they would see that they are, they are the fool, that they themselves are the fool for, for what
03:09:53 they do to her, but no, they're too blind, they're too blind and too fucking judgmental, Munchy,
03:09:58 they're too judgmental, they can't, they can't see that in this, clearly in this fucking case of all
03:10:05 cases, it's warranted. In this case, it's special and deserved. Like this alicorn, this, this alicorn
03:10:14 that we're looking at right now is not, it's like, no, but look at that fucking avatar,
03:10:20 fucking look at it for a second Munchy, fucking, fucking look at it, look at it Munchy, thank you,
03:10:24 thank you, okay, all like this, this is not your typical run of the mill Mary Sue alicorn
03:10:35 that we're looking at here, this is not that, this, this is unique, this is special, this,
03:10:40 this brings a whole new fucking dimension to the, to the quote unquote Mary Sue. This is,
03:10:45 this is a character with depth and dimensionality behind it, okay, this is other alicorns, yeah,
03:10:51 like other alicorns give the practice of making alicorn or sees a bad name by being like, by
03:10:57 being like too cool and being like too special and being yeah, I'll admit it, I'll, I'll say it,
03:11:04 Mary Sue's right, like those al, like those alicorns give, give this person a bad name,
03:11:10 this person has to grapple with the unearned negative reputation that others have fucking,
03:11:16 the stigma that others have imbued alicorn OCs with. I, I have no, there's no end, Munchy,
03:11:24 there is no fucking end to the spite and the bile and the vitriol that I feel for this person.
03:11:30 There's no light at the end of the tunnel. What? There's no light at the end of the tunnel,
03:11:34 it's all, it's all agony, there's no fucking hope. There's no, there's,
03:11:40 I'm looking into, I'm looking into the eyes, I'm, yeah, there's no light, there's no light,
03:11:45 there's no light at the end of the tunnel that is the eyes that let the, that are the window
03:11:49 to the soul of the person that has created fucking, what is their name, fucking rainbow bliss?
03:11:56 Something fucking retarded. Rainbow wishes? There's just nothing.
03:12:03 Canker sores. There's, there's just nothing. I mean this whole, oh. What? What, what the fuck are
03:12:14 these? I don't know, I don't know what's happening, I don't know what's happening with their feet.
03:12:20 God, I didn't even notice. Are they gems? Are they like metal plates? They're toenails.
03:12:29 Oh, oh, ew, oh, I hope not. Oh, I hope that's not what that is. I fucking hope that's not what that
03:12:37 is, dude. No. Because if that's what that is, we're gonna have a fucking problem.
03:12:44 Look at her like, look at her like too cool for school fucking rat tail. Her like fucking
03:12:48 elephant rat tail. What do you mean, she needs to bring, she needs to breathe some life into the
03:12:56 Alicorn OC and she needs to breathe some life with her original fucking- I guess, dude, I guess
03:13:02 it's original, but don't fucking tell me that it's not some bullshit. Look at that bold stance.
03:13:09 She has something to fucking say, and she's not gonna, she's not gonna be beheldant to your
03:13:14 pre-existing notions that Alicorn overseas aren't cool. Look at how that tail fucking clips through
03:13:19 the ground that her hooves are on. Look at how the tail goes below, goes below where her fucking
03:13:28 hooves meet the ground. How the fuck does that work? Okay, look at her goggles. Do you like how
03:13:33 the goggles are at one side of the face because that horn should realistically be in between,
03:13:38 like above the far side goggle and beneath? I did, I did, I did notice that, Munchy. I did
03:13:44 notice how the goggles are on one side. Um, hey, do you like how her fucking cutie mark,
03:13:50 how her fucking cutie mark overlaps the seam between her torso and back leg? Do you like that?
03:13:57 Do you like that, Munchy? Yeah, me too. Big fan, big fan over here.
03:14:02 This, I just realized too that that that that that these like these these like goggles like like
03:14:12 the actual like like like lens part like are completely different art style and look completely
03:14:18 different than the rest of the body. Yeah, they were clearly drawn by an inept amateur who thought,
03:14:28 I mean, just look at how they're fucking like the shape of the goggles looks like they've been
03:14:33 melted. Yeah. Like, look how thin this one is. Yeah.
03:14:43 This is, it's all on one side, it's all on one side of the hair in the horn. It's all on one side.
03:14:48 The pink lenses, the pink lenses on the brown goggles, on the white, on the black hair.
03:14:54 Think about it.
03:14:58 Look, look, just look at the fucking, look at the fucking pixelation of the edge of that cutie
03:15:04 mark. Look at the fucking aspect ratio of that cutie mark on that tiny ass leg.
03:15:11 It was, it's just, it's like, it's like the cutie mark doesn't, it's like the cutie
03:15:16 mark doesn't even exist. Like it's just been like painted on the glass that we're viewing this caged
03:15:21 animal through. Oh, fuck. God. The way this like, this like line is going to,
03:15:32 it looks like it's going right into her fucking asshole, not going like above it or anything.
03:15:36 You're right. Yeah, it's too low. It's too, yeah, it doesn't look like it connects to the spine.
03:15:42 It should be, it should be coming out the fucking top of the ass, not the bottom you faggots.
03:15:46 Oh my god. Do you like how obviously this is like, like control T and photoshop.
03:15:53 Oh my god. Yeah, I just noticed that. Yeah, look how fucking, look how fucking, what's the word,
03:15:59 skewed? Look how fucking skewed the ass. Yeah, like fully skewed and distorted.
03:16:02 Look how skewed the aspect ratio on those wings are. They're so fucking bad. It's all so bad. Also,
03:16:11 look how, look how, look how huge the ears are. Wait, wait, wait, okay, okay. The ears are huge
03:16:20 and so is the fucking line on the ears, meaning that the ear, like that's an ear asset that was
03:16:26 just taken and like fucking enlarged. Line and all, line and all. Control T, you just, just like,
03:16:35 yeah, just, just fucking drag that shit. Look how, look where the horn, look how huge her
03:16:42 forehead is. Like look where the eyes end and the horn must begin. Look how much fucking space there
03:16:49 is between the eyes and the horn, dude. Exactly, exactly. So the line would be like this. Ideally,
03:16:54 the horn would be right here and then like, like downward because it should be on the forehead,
03:16:58 but now it's like basically on the top of the head now. Yeah, basically, and the ears just
03:17:04 like fucking go bat, like bat, like bat ears. I mean, maybe that's intentional. I don't know. I kind
03:17:09 of, I kind of like like the huge ears. Like I think they look fine, except for the fact that,
03:17:13 that the, that the line on them is so fucking thick that you can tell they were just controlled to
03:17:17 eat. Yeah. It really, it really gets me though. It really gets me that the tail goes below where
03:17:25 the hooves meet the ground. Like that really bothers me. Like the only, the only logical
03:17:32 explanation for it is that like, it's actually like the tail is extending like so far into the
03:17:38 foreground that it like, look, that like from our upward viewing angle, like it looks further down.
03:17:44 You know what I'm saying? But like, but like, it's, it's behind her. Like the tail is behind
03:17:50 her and yet it suddenly like shoots forward. Oh my God, the positioning of the tail in,
03:17:55 in 3D space is insane. It's insanity. Let's, let's, let's examine the chain of events here.
03:18:04 This person, this person makes this OC. Yeah. Actually, actually, no, no, no. I, I, I read a
03:18:11 little bit on the summary page. She originally had a Pegasus like OC. Okay. So assuming just this
03:18:17 without a horn. Yeah. Then a quote unquote important change happens in her life and she
03:18:23 changes it to an alicorn. So she has this OC. Wait, is that, is that what it said? Is that
03:18:29 what the wiki said? That an important change happened in her life and that she made it into
03:18:33 an alicorn? Yes. Okay. That's interesting. This is interesting. So this, wait, what is this person's name?
03:18:41 Uh, lightning blitz. Lightning blitz. That's it. Lightning blitz, not rainbow blitz. Yeah,
03:18:47 good stuff. Good stuff. Okay. Okay. So she is representing herself. She's representing her
03:18:54 ideas and everything about herself through this image. This is the image that she, that she chooses,
03:19:02 that she willingly represents herself with, right? That's, that, that, that's event number one. Yeah.
03:19:07 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Event number two, she, she gets a backlash for having an alicorn OC and
03:19:15 being an unoriginal, deplorable human being. Yeah. Okay. That is, that is what happened,
03:19:24 I believe. I can buy that. I buy that story. Okay. Okay. Okay. So at this point, she's already,
03:19:30 she's already off the deep end for just, for this existing. Yeah. Due to the fact that this exists,
03:19:36 she's already, like, like, she's, she's not worth it. We need to get rid of her. Like,
03:19:40 like, she's not worth saving. Yeah. Like, like, like, like, it's, it's gone to the point where,
03:19:45 like, a police tax force has to be, like, called in. Like, there's no point. Yeah, something has to
03:19:50 be done. Yeah. Yeah. So we're already at that point. Stage three, she contacts Dr. Wolfe. Well,
03:20:00 well, you know, you know, there's, there's another step, which is that she was making,
03:20:04 I think she made like a, like one or two, like, fucking review, you know, like the quote unquote
03:20:08 reviews that you can make in this community and can be considered like a legit creator.
03:20:13 Like, she made some fucking video of her with her OC talking about like, I don't know how
03:20:19 Twilight is gay or something. You know, like, she did a couple, she did a couple of those,
03:20:25 and she got active in the community. And like, she made a bunch of friends with a bunch of the
03:20:29 other people. And like, you know, she had her OC and da, da, da, da, and she was in the riff.
03:20:33 Like, like, that's, that's, that's step three, that's step three. Yeah.
03:20:37 Like, like, she, she just, she just stumbles, she just stumbles, asks forward and, and, and,
03:20:42 and to fame somehow. I mean, I mean, fame is, but yeah, into what, into what is, what is considered
03:20:48 fame in, in, as far as, yeah, she becomes a notable name among this, like, fucking, this fucking cult.
03:20:56 It's called, it's called, it is slu. Yeah.
03:21:00 So, she, she, she achieves, she achieves horse famous. Yeah, such as it is. And then, and, and,
03:21:09 and then do, do, do the immense cyberbullying of people, of people telling her that his,
03:21:16 that her OC is uninspired in sippy drivel. Yep. Yep. She, she, she contacts the mythical
03:21:26 legendary Dr. himself, Dr. Wool. Yeah. Cause she's, cause she's got the hookups, right? Cause like,
03:21:32 she's in the fucking riff and she's talking to tune critic and Eliora and Golden Fox and other
03:21:37 like heavy hitters, you know? They're, they're, they're, they're riffing, they're riffing, they're
03:21:42 having fun. Yeah, they're riffing, they're riffing the rift. Yeah, they're, they're riffing. Yeah.
03:21:47 She contacts Dr. Wool with a proposition unlike any of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm with you so far.
03:21:56 I'm with you. Let me come on your show. Yeah. I'm assuming she drew it or, you know, you know,
03:22:04 fuck it. We'll just get someone else to drop for, for, for, for maybe $10. Yeah. Yeah. I'll drop,
03:22:10 I'll drop 10 bucks on this fucking, on this important career move that I'm making.
03:22:15 I've got something. I've got, I've got, I've got something that's been eating away at me,
03:22:19 Doc. You, Dr. Wool, a, a, a re, a real licensed psychologist, which he totally is. He, he, he,
03:22:28 he is the master of psychoanalysis and you need to come to him with all of your problems.
03:22:34 Yeah. Or else just what the fuck are you doing? Yeah, yeah. Just making the point. Doc, I got a
03:22:39 problem. People are making fun of me for being a no talent, awful, meaningless, a horrible waste of
03:22:53 existence. People are getting on my back for being the most uninspired, creatively bankrupt,
03:23:01 like horrible meat minuscule on the planet. Fuck meat minuscule. I need, I need to reach,
03:23:11 I need you to console me. I need you to tell me that everything's going to be okay.
03:23:16 Yeah. Yeah. Please tell me, tell me that it's okay to keep doing what I'm doing. That's what
03:23:23 she wants. Please. Yeah. I need, it, it, I need, I need you to tell me. Make it clear that the
03:23:30 official Doctor Wolf position, make it clear that the official Doctor Wolf position is that this is
03:23:35 fine and good. Let, let the world fucking know. Yeah. That, that hashtag I stand with lightning
03:23:46 bliss, I stand in solidarity with the disabled and wounded veteran that is lightning bliss.
03:23:55 Oh no. Oh God, no. God, no, doc. Don't do it. Don't fucking sign that. Don't fucking sign that
03:24:01 infernal pact. But you know what? I know how the story ends. I know how the story ends and he
03:24:08 fucking, spoiler alert. He fucking did it. I could use another video. Yeah. Yeah. I need,
03:24:15 I need more content to keep my patrons happy, to keep that fucking, to keep that fucking
03:24:20 meaningless trickle of money, just, just trickling away into my bank account so I can not pay my
03:24:25 artists with it. Oh my God. I say it's, I say it's a deal, Miss Bliss. Yeah. Yeah. I think,
03:24:34 I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. I think we both stand, I think we
03:24:41 both stand to gain from our new union, our new business agreement. Yes. Yes. You supply, you
03:24:50 supply, you supply the childish naivete and fucking utter incompetence and lack of self-awareness
03:24:58 that the community at large can empathize with and all provide and all provide the fucking bogus
03:25:05 trumped up absolute bullshit sense of creepy paternal authority and affirmation that people
03:25:11 like you and your miserable, ill crave, you know, to fucking rock yourselves to sleep at night
03:25:18 in your fucking, in your little, in your little fucking homemade cribs, in your little emotional
03:25:24 cribs that you sleep in. You fucks, you piece of shit. Jesus fucking Christ. You know, you know,
03:25:32 it's actually worse. It's actually even worse than you say, Munchy, because she wasn't, because
03:25:38 the criticism she was receiving is not, you, the criticism she was sensitive to is not like,
03:25:44 your shit sucks and you're terrible, because that, while true, is not a valid criticism in the,
03:25:51 in the Brony analysis escape, right? What, what the criticism was, was not anything substantial.
03:26:00 The criticism was that she was being written off specifically for being an alicorn and that
03:26:05 is unacceptable. You know what that is? That's literally racism. She was literally experiencing
03:26:11 racism for the, for the, for the, you know, she didn't choose this, Munchy. She didn't choose
03:26:18 to be an alicorn. This was, you know, this is just who she is and she doesn't deserve to be
03:26:23 judged for it because it's not like, because it's not like any kind of like creative decision making
03:26:29 or design ethos went into her being an alicorn. This is just who she is and you can't,
03:26:37 you can't fucking judge her for it, Munchy. You, you bigot. And, and if you do-
03:26:44 So much for the internet's most tolerant fandom, am I right guys?
03:26:48 Yeah, yeah. Like they're just, like they're just, they just come into it, like they just come into
03:26:55 it. They come into watching her videos with all these assumptions based solely on the fact that
03:27:02 her al, her OC is an alicorn, which, you know, if they just gave her a chance, if they just,
03:27:08 if they just gave her a chance they would see, they would have all their fucking bigoted preconception
03:27:14 shattered, Munchy. They would have them shattered and they would see the beautiful person.
03:27:18 Their earth would be wrong at the sheer uniqueness and the sheer creativity coming out of, of, of,
03:27:27 of this fucking powerhouse of imagination. You know what, you know what, I'm, I'm look,
03:27:34 I'm not gonna read like any of it, but I looked at the wiki and I get the sense, I get the sense
03:27:39 that this OC, that this character actually does, like I'm not, I can't speak to its quality, although
03:27:46 I'm sure it's garbage. This, this, this character actually does like have some kind of a background
03:27:52 to it, which like, I'm sure it sucks, but I respect that there at least is one, right? Oh no, oh
03:27:58 never mind, never mind, because I'm seeing that like it's all tied in with the fucking Rift Cafe.
03:28:05 Yeah. Whatever, I don't know, at least there's something, like at least this person has some
03:28:09 kind of like a character, right? Even if it's shit. Lightning Bliss was a Pegasus pony, all right.
03:28:14 Even, even if it's shit and stupid and retarded, at least this person has something, at least this
03:28:19 person isn't Toon Critic, whose fucking OC background is, I review ponies and I wear a fucking hat and
03:28:26 a scarf, right? Oh my god. Oh my god. What? After investing her time and her artwork to others
03:28:33 whom requested it, she soon later started up the Lightning Bliss show after she felt the need to
03:28:39 express herself about the MLP series through her own imagery and animation capabilities. Oh my god.
03:28:49 Who writes like that? It's like, okay, so her, so her, so her backstory, so her backstory is
03:28:56 she's an artist who started an MLP channel. That's, that's her backstory. Okay, never mind.
03:29:02 I mean, what is, I mean, there's this thing about, wait, no, go up, go up. The thing about
03:29:05 Lightning Bliss' dimension. Like, that's, okay, you know, maybe I was wrong. I thought for a second
03:29:11 that this person- Oh, I asked God that it was just this image and I was going to fucking die.
03:29:18 Like, I thought for, I thought for a second that they was like a backstory, but apparently there's
03:29:22 not, it's just I started a YouTube channel. Uh, here we go, here we go. Created after she first
03:29:29 started her show a few episodes later, originally Lightning Bliss hosted her show in an old hotel
03:29:34 cabin due she wasn't ready to be fully exposed to the rest of the Brony analysis reviewing community.
03:29:40 She also was nervous of the fact that she was an alicorn and feared she wouldn't be accepted.
03:29:45 With doubt in her mind, she rented out and did her reviews in quiet. Oh my god, after being isolated
03:29:51 and she couldn't expand her creativity. How much of this is real and how much of this is like fake,
03:29:57 like kayfabe? How much of this is kayfabe? I don't know. I'm thinking none. I'm thinking like
03:30:03 literally none, like zero to 1%. Lightning Bliss decided to break free of her fear and hide out
03:30:09 for the chance to become something more as a reviewer and as an alicorn but still have her
03:30:13 place safe within the community. She whipped out her lioness tail and painted the special,
03:30:20 she painted the special dimension that opened within the fourth wall of the rift because she
03:30:24 is an alicorn. She felt it was only natural. She'd be in a place that represented the alicorn
03:30:29 mystery. Hence why it is similar to that of the dimension that was created by Princess Celestia,
03:30:35 though both dimension is tail painted and holds more unusual. Oh, her thing is that she like paints
03:30:40 things with her tail and they become real. That's her magic alicorn. It's even more unusual magical
03:30:46 properties than average. She's so unique. Holy shit. You know what? You know what? I take back
03:30:53 everything I said. I take back everything I said. There is nothing redeeming about this person.
03:30:58 There is nothing redeeming about any of this. You know, I'm really, I'm actually torn because I,
03:31:04 man, I really like, okay, I like the idea. I like the idea of like telling a story through YouTube,
03:31:13 like with the conceit of like it, like with the self-awareness that it is being told through
03:31:21 YouTube. Like, I like the idea of like a fiction being constructed, like knowingly constructed
03:31:27 through the medium of like YouTube videos that are presented as YouTube videos. You know what I'm
03:31:33 saying? Yeah, yeah, like like like a marble hornet's bed and shit. Like spooky ARG shit. Yeah, yeah.
03:31:41 Like, like, like a character, like you're getting windows into a character, but the character is
03:31:46 presented through like the lens of like these are the YouTube videos that they make, you know?
03:31:52 Yeah. This is not, this is like trying at that, but like it's not that and it sucks and I hate it.
03:31:58 Like the whole rift, like the whole rift is like sort of that, but not really and I hate it.
03:32:04 Ben, this isn't a joke. The plot of like painting a window into a special dimension,
03:32:12 I kid you not, that was the plot of like a like right wherever you want short story I did in the
03:32:19 fifth grade. That's not a fucking joke. That's literally what the plot was. Like, it's like,
03:32:28 this is like such a, this is like such like a self-important, important, important self-important
03:32:35 story. This is such like a self-indulgent story, right? And like it's all for the grand,
03:32:41 like the grand climax of this story is that this person becomes a pony reviewer, right?
03:32:51 Like that's the, like that's the grand finale of this person's story.
03:32:55 And how grand it is.
03:33:00 She was, she was tormented, tormented by her fear of not being accepted by the analysis community
03:33:08 for being an alicorn, but she fucking rose above it. Oh god, I'm, I'm tired.
03:33:14 Christ above hate.
03:33:15 I'm tired and I can't, I'm getting, I'm actually like, I feel weak, like I feel weak and sick and hungry.
03:33:22 We haven't, we haven't even gone through the,
03:33:27 is this who I, is this who I think it is?
03:33:30 Yeah, man. Oh.
03:33:31 That's the, that's the man himself, the man in the myth.
03:33:34 It's the man himself.
03:33:34 The man in the myth, the legend. Let me, let me look at, give me a minute.
03:33:39 I need to look in my fridge and fucking find some calories to consume.
03:33:43 Okay.
03:33:45 Pause the right footage calculus here.
03:33:50 He's known for his opinion on, oh my god.
03:33:55 A notable, a notable characteristic of this, of this person is that he has an opinion.
03:34:04 He has an opinion on a word.
03:34:08 Not even that it's like a contrary, he just has a opinion.
03:34:12 He just has a, he has, no. This isn't believable.
03:34:22 Yes. Fuck yes. Jaffas.
03:34:25 Ben.
03:34:25 I got Jaffas.
03:34:26 Ben. Okay, yeah.
03:34:27 Ben.
03:34:27 Yep.
03:34:28 A no, a notable characteristic of this pony has an opinion on double rainbow.
03:34:36 Hat is known for his opinion.
03:34:38 Oh.
03:34:39 He has a opinion.
03:34:41 Oh my fucking god, Munchie.
03:34:43 He has an opinion.
03:34:45 He, he's known for it in fact.
03:34:48 Yeah.
03:34:48 I mean, I mean, I mean clearly what's meant to be communicated here is that he has like
03:35:03 a notable opinion or like a controversial opinion.
03:35:06 Like that's what they're trying to say, but they didn't say it.
03:35:10 Okay. I like, okay, I like how they switch between Josh and Firebrand.
03:35:19 Okay. Firebrand is a Christian.
03:35:21 Josh formerly served in the Marines.
03:35:24 I like how both of these things are associated with JSW Connors,
03:35:27 and now I'm just going to, I'm just going to imagine that they are one and the same.
03:35:30 Wait a minute. So are they saying, so are they saying that like specifically Fire,
03:35:36 like the pony is a Christian?
03:35:38 Like not the guy, the pony is one.
03:35:41 That's what it seems to be saying to me.
03:35:43 That's what my cutie mark is telling me, you might say.
03:35:48 Ink Rose and himself are shipped quite frequently in the fandom,
03:35:52 and even have two Fannin children by the name of Citrus Flossum and Morning Shine.
03:35:58 Well, Fannin, that's like the same thing as being real.
03:36:02 Yeah. So far.
03:36:06 Somebody, somebody made a, oh, these Jaffas ate a whole roll of them.
03:36:15 Somebody made a drawing of keg standard and mod pie's son, and it was actually really good.
03:36:22 And it was weird. I found it on DeviantArt, and it was amidst like a bunch of other OCs
03:36:28 that like this person was not drawing like the analysis community.
03:36:33 Why that picture? Why that picture?
03:36:37 Stop everything.
03:36:39 Like this person, this person was not drawing like analysis.
03:36:42 He was drawing like kids of like in canon characters.
03:36:45 Like like the only, the only analysis personality that I saw among their work
03:36:49 was keg standard, and it was as the dad of like this son of mod pie.
03:36:54 So I don't know. And it was pretty cool too.
03:36:57 Yeah, it's pretty fucking cool. Let's see. Let's see what keg's up to.
03:37:02 Oh, why? Why don't they just fucking picture from the fucking videos?
03:37:07 Why don't they use the fucking canon art? This is Jesus.
03:37:12 Why? Like he looks like fucking garbage.
03:37:16 For him and for you are completely baffling.
03:37:20 Yeah, I just don't understand why.
03:37:32 Just nothing's here besides the fucking reference sheet and some shit part.
03:37:36 I'm fed up. I'm fed up with this world. Everybody betray me.
03:37:43 Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
03:37:48 Okay, okay, okay.

03:38:06 Okay. Yeah, yeah, there we go. Fuck that boy.
03:38:11 He's done for a voice of reason.
03:38:14 Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Master of the Rift.
03:38:19 The master. Ink is his apprentice.
03:38:22 Voice has a darker side called horror.
03:38:27 Sentience in a physical form and he now lives with Koi.

03:39:52 Do you like how this unironically has way more like stuff on it than the PCP wiki?
03:39:58 Um, man, I don't fucking get, I don't fucking get the priorities of the people making the PCP wiki.
03:40:07 I just want to make shitty memes.

03:40:50 Oh, okay.

03:40:56 It's sacred, it's sacred ground.
03:40:58 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:41:59 And, and, and you, and you mixed together like all the worst parts about humanity
03:42:05 and all the most naive, awful, horrible, horrible aspects of, of, of, of like 2010,

03:42:26 It's like, man, I don't know.
03:42:31 Six hours ago.
03:42:32 I look, I look at this and I'm like, man, fucking anyone, fucking anyone can fucking make it on
03:42:42 YouTube if this, like, they just talk about the right things and they have like a, like,

03:42:49 Like he drew a turtle and he was, he had it fucking was made.
03:42:52 Like that, that was it.
03:42:53 He did it.
03:42:53 Like he, he did it.
03:42:54 You know, I guess he probably got his, he got a little bump.
03:42:57 He probably got that initial pony bump and then he just moved on.
03:43:02 I don't know.
03:43:03 Does there, I mean, am I crazy?
03:43:05 Do I, am I seeing, does there seem to you to be anything fucking like interesting or
03:43:09 notable about like his comedy at all?
03:43:12 No.
03:43:12 Like it looks like any other fucking goofy, shitty comedy,
03:43:16 fagotry that you'd see on any other channel.
03:43:18 That's what I'm fucking seeing.
03:43:20 That's what I see.
03:43:21 Exactly the same as fucking everything else we've seen tonight.
03:43:25 A, a, a podcast known as Bro Talk, you know, the Rattyfuckers Cop Killers doesn't have the,
03:43:31 the unique and instantly recognizable branding that Bro Talk has.
03:43:38 I love the Rattyfuckers Cop Killers, dude.
03:43:41 I fucking, I need it.
03:43:42 It's, it's perfect.
03:43:43 I need it.
03:43:43 I'm glad we're not just besmirching it at all.
03:43:47 I'm, I'm gonna see.
03:43:51 I want to see how many views Bro Talk gets.
03:43:59 I want to get into the anime James.
03:44:00 Who's the guy you wanted to see?
03:44:01 Dr. Fowl.
03:44:02 Yeah, Dr. Fowl.
03:44:03 Oh my God, he's, he's perfect.
03:44:08 He looks really good.
03:44:10 He looks really good.
03:44:12 Yeah, he looks.
03:44:15 Look at it.
03:44:16 Look at his tail.
03:44:19 This is incredible.
03:44:21 Dr. Fowl's den for the mentally impaired.
03:44:27 What's your problem?
03:44:29 He's great.
03:44:30 He's fucking great.
03:44:32 Is this guy like, like a parody of Dr. Hold on.
03:44:37 I think he may be like a satire.
03:44:45 No, you know what?
03:44:47 He's not a satire.
03:44:48 He's just like, he's just like, he's just a fucking regular ass pony faggot.
03:44:53 He's just got like, he's just got like a slightly like kind of quirky and like
03:44:57 unself-serious kind of like humorous edge to him.
03:45:02 Oh yeah, he's the head honcho of the chicken brigade.
03:45:06 Ah, shit.
03:45:08 Yeah, he's not, he's like, he's like, he's like half a notch above your regular
03:45:13 fucking pony guy, but like he's not, he's not like, he's still, he's still one of them.
03:45:23 He's so cool and aloof.
03:45:25 He's, he's still one of them though.
03:45:27 I really wanted to like him.
03:45:29 Yeah, like I really, I really wanted this guy's whole existence to just,
03:45:33 I wanted him to be another Kimmy Sparkle.
03:45:35 I wanted him to be just be taking the piss out of the whole thing.
03:45:40 Dr. Fowl.
03:45:42 Oh my fucking god.
03:45:44 That would have been incredible.
03:45:46 Dr. Fowl, if you're watching this, please, please, please take a red pill, join the PCP.
03:45:53 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
03:45:53 Don't go back, don't go back.
03:45:54 Dr. Fowl's backstory.
03:45:56 No, you fucking nerd.
03:45:58 Dr. Fowl's backstory, it is said he hails from the life being a stone of,
03:46:03 a stone bird that shattered to create life on the, okay, first of all,
03:46:06 this is written like a fucking grade schooler.
03:46:09 The byproduct of this being the energy that brought the rift into B.
03:46:12 Oh, his backstory is about the rift.
03:46:14 After a few iterations, Hephaestus, what?
03:46:17 Dr. Fowl was formed from the egg of his father's soul,
03:46:20 when it split off into two entities, Dr. Fowl and King Cocklesworth.
03:46:24 The bronalysis king born of the egg formed by the second Hephaestus.
03:46:28 Well, Dr. Fowl stayed in the present.
03:46:30 King Cocklesworth went into the future and ran the world as its king.
03:46:33 Did Dr. Fowl solve-
03:46:34 This is kind of like incredible.
03:46:36 Yeah, it is actually.
03:46:38 Dr. Fowl saw the world and thought that he would take the form of a pony
03:46:41 to try to fit in.
03:46:42 But after growing a distaste for the content created by the people around him,
03:46:46 he took it upon himself to shed his pony form and take upon his true form.
03:46:49 What does he mean?
03:46:50 What does he fucking mean, his distaste for the content?
03:46:53 How fucking deep does this rabbit hole go?
03:46:56 We have to watch a video.
03:46:58 Yeah, we do.
03:46:58 Yeah, we do.
03:46:59 If there's like a lore video, we have to fucking watch that.
03:47:04 Fowl play.
03:47:06 407 subscribers.
03:47:08 Uh, the Hephaestus story?
03:47:11 Day 6, the birth time of the king!
03:47:13 Wait, wait, wait.
03:47:14 How fucking-
03:47:15 The Hephaestus story full.
03:47:17 Oh my god.
03:47:18 The Hephaestus story full.
03:47:20 Oh my god.
03:47:21 Jesus.
03:47:23 Jesus Christ.
03:47:26 Full screen that shit, dude.
03:47:30 In the beginning, there was the life lead.
03:47:33 An entity of unimaginable power that infused the planet with its spirit.
03:47:39 This caused the life being to the common state.
03:47:43 Causing its body to spit on-
03:47:44 Look at that!
03:47:45 Into many shards named the Aesthetes, throughout the omnivores.
03:47:50 These rune stones were not the only thing coming from the life being.
03:47:55 But underneath the rune stone shelf was the icon, the lane of light and darkness.
03:48:01 And on the small tracks that the lean stone climbs with a glop of icon,
03:48:06 it falls into a beam known as the Wayfarer.
03:48:11 One of these Wayfarers is known as Hephaestus, or the Bird of Passage.
03:48:19 Landing on a world in the taker and mummaging that doesn't clean us.
03:48:24 We are spoken as a journey of good, and, and not, and death, and everything between.
03:48:35 We were completely wrong about this guy.
03:48:37 Yeah, yeah.
03:48:38 Hephaestus took the form of a glowing white, ancient silhouette.
03:48:43 Traversing the barren planet, creating more-
03:48:45 I can't believe this.
03:48:47 More life he created.
03:48:48 I cannot fucking believe this.
03:48:51 I'm so delighted.
03:48:53 We've got to get this guy on the PCB.
03:48:56 He's got to be on an episode.
03:48:58 He's got-
03:48:58 Dude, we should fucking get him on the next Rowdyfuckers cop killers.
03:49:03 Yes, we should!
03:49:04 Mermaids and Sphinxes, one of his neoterics, a harpy known as Shine, caught his interest.
03:49:12 And after a short time together, they fell in love.
03:49:15 In a way to prolong Hephaestus' fate from existence,
03:49:19 the two merged their forms into an egg.
03:49:23 The egg combined with Hephaestus and the neoteric Shine laid dormant-
03:49:29 This is some high-level Christ consciousness shit.
03:49:31 Doing this stuff, the world began to develop.
03:49:34 This is super fucking-
03:49:36 This is super Greenpill.
03:49:38 And neither the two alicorn descendants of the neoterics.
03:49:42 Nearing the end of the a thousand years, the alicorns fought with a strong foe.
03:49:48 The energy of the battle caused the egg to hatch into Hephaestus, the second.
03:49:55 And gave the alicorns one day, capable only of observation.
03:50:01 Hephaestus the second began watching the world form,
03:50:05 and noticed a cave on the side of a large mountain.
03:50:09 In said cave was a wormhole into a space-like plane filled with floating rocks.
03:50:16 This plane seemed to connect many, many planes.
03:50:21 Suddenly, Hephaestus the second noticed a strange energy emanating from the whip.
03:50:28 Noticing the danger in the situation.
03:50:31 Used some of his power in an attempt to see-
03:50:34 This is the greatest-
03:50:35 This is the greatest development in the history of the Rowdyfuckers cop killers.
03:50:39 In the long and storied history of the Rowdyfuckers cop killers program.
03:50:45 Hephaestus took its toll on Hephaestus.
03:50:47 His body was weak and he had taken too much with energy.
03:50:51 His body shook as his soul left his body, splitting into two miles of purple light.
03:50:58 Why were they purple?
03:50:59 The light formed into egg shapes.
03:51:02 One disappeared through time, and the other merged with the limp, lifeless body of Hephaestus the second.
03:51:10 Hephaestus the second's body glowed and morphed into a new-
03:51:13 His own soul came out of him, split into two,
03:51:17 and then half of it went back into him and turned him into an egg.
03:51:20 The energy from the soul egg traveling through time
03:51:23 caused the rift hole to move to one of the many microplates.
03:51:28 The soul egg's destination, five thousand years into the future,
03:51:33 a land in which one hundred seasons of my little pony had aired.
03:51:38 It had formed into a humanoid body with a chicken's head.
03:51:44 After a brief glow, this Hephaestus remembered his past.
03:51:49 Alongside an ability to see specific errors.
03:51:51 Now we're getting real.
03:51:53 In detail, using this knowledge,
03:51:56 he quickly rose to become a respected figure in the future world,
03:52:01 eventually becoming crowned as King Cockroach.
03:52:07 In the past, the egg hatched into Hephaestus the second,
03:52:11 after flying around and seeing how much life had changed,
03:52:14 he overheard a bearded pony still in the past,
03:52:17 and learning the alicorns had taken a few liberties
03:52:21 aligning up the neoterics and Hephaestuses,
03:52:24 writing their names down as Hephaestus Applebee's Juniper Moonberry.
03:52:29 This Hephaestus decided in protest to this blasphemy
03:52:33 to make this his true name,
03:52:37 becoming known as Hephaestus Applebee's Juniper Moonberry.
03:52:41 Now it is known as Hephaestus Applebee's Juniper Moonberry,
03:52:44 through his aeus, Dr. Fowl.
03:52:47 Oh. Oh my god.
03:52:50 That's it. We did it.
03:52:53 Now we know.
03:52:54 He's everything, Munchie.
03:52:57 He's perfect.
03:52:58 He's a perfect human.
03:53:00 He's perfect.
03:53:01 He's the next evolution.
03:53:11 Wait, King Cocklesworth teaches you about the future.
03:53:16 Bottom right, bottom right.
03:53:19 This is important.
03:53:22 It's like a merit launch.
03:53:23 Hello. It is I, King Cocklesworth, and welcome to the King's...
03:53:28 This guy watches Jesse.
03:53:30 Did you know?
03:53:31 Yeah, he does.
03:53:32 King Cocklesworth. I'm from the future.
03:53:35 Yes. In the year 4000, we have had around 1000.
03:53:41 And 900 seasons of my little pony.
03:53:44 Each one has gotten better.
03:53:48 The show has gotten so good that they have transcended
03:53:52 and found peace in the plain beyond.
03:53:55 For me, though, well, I can't ascend just yet.
03:53:58 I have a kingdom to rule, and pitch is to take care of.
03:54:02 Like a dorky and linda.
03:54:04 I have to learn what is left of the brony analysis community.
03:54:09 I mean, I'm the third in a very prestigious line
03:54:12 dating back to the origins of the world.
03:54:15 I even inherited my name from the OG Hephaestus.
03:54:20 So I am very important.
03:54:22 He's like...
03:54:26 I'm in love.
03:54:28 He like rides the line so carefully and like so elegantly.
03:54:35 Like completely totally like unhinged.
03:54:37 You know what?
03:54:38 Like reading his description on the wiki just really did not do him justice.
03:54:43 Yeah.
03:54:45 Hold on.
03:54:46 He totally fucking watches Jesse.
03:54:48 Like there's no bones of that.
03:54:50 Yeah, yeah.
03:54:51 He's that's...
03:54:51 Hold on, hold on, hold on.
03:54:56 Wait. Featured channels.
03:54:58 Lethal Aurora Mage.
03:55:01 Antony C.
03:55:03 Shelley D.
03:55:04 Huh.
03:55:06 What?
03:55:07 Corpulent Brony?
03:55:09 How I wonder...
03:55:09 Wait, I wonder if Mage knows this guy.
03:55:12 I wonder if Mage fucking knows this guy.
03:55:15 I'm gonna ask her.
03:55:15 If so, why hasn't she fucking shown us?
03:55:18 Yeah, I'm gonna fucking ask her right now and then kill her.
03:55:27 Have you seen this bird?
03:55:35 Whoa.
03:55:39 Okay, there's like one that's like said inside Dr. Wolf's thing.
03:55:47 Oh, okay, it's like...
03:55:49 It's like a remix of The Grinch or something.
03:56:00 I just...
03:56:01 Yeah, this guy is totally...
03:56:04 I'm gonna go fucking subscribe right now.
03:56:06 Yeah, do it.
03:56:09 I'm reading the lyrics of this like Mr. Grinch parody song he made about himself.
03:56:15 And he's totally...
03:56:16 Like the inspiration for this character was literally just he hated Dr. Wolf so fucking much.
03:56:24 Are you sure?
03:56:27 Look at the lyrics on screen right now.
03:56:29 Oh, oh god.
03:56:35 Wait, he says...
03:56:39 I'm not...
03:56:40 I don't know, man.
03:56:41 I'm not sure.
03:56:42 It sounds kind of like he's making...
03:56:44 He's making unflattering comparisons of himself to Dr. Wolf.
03:56:48 Like he's a bad version of Dr. Wolf.
03:56:51 Like Dr. Wolf is good.
03:56:54 I...
03:56:54 I don't know, man.
03:56:56 I'm not sure.
03:56:58 I'm not...
03:56:58 Like I'm actually not sure.
03:57:00 Like I want...
03:57:01 I want to believe that this guy is good.
03:57:04 But I don't know.
03:57:05 I could...
03:57:06 He could...
03:57:07 It could all just be a happy accident.
03:57:11 Could he be...
03:57:12 Like could such a...
03:57:13 Could such a genius...
03:57:13 The freest you could store other drawings while the sky says a therapist.
03:57:16 I feel like that has to be like...
03:57:17 No, but then he says...
03:57:18 Yeah, but he also says you just copied your show from the wolf.
03:57:22 Oh fuck.
03:57:23 Yeah.
03:57:23 Oh shit.
03:57:29 You're a fake gynecologist and psychologist chicken who thinks he's a god.
03:57:35 Uh...
03:57:36 Uh...
03:57:40 It's...
03:57:41 It's...
03:57:42 Man, that fucking backstory was so good though.
03:57:46 He...
03:57:47 This is the most perplexing thing I've ever fucking seen for my fucking life.
03:57:51 Yeah.
03:57:53 It's...
03:57:55 It's so...
03:57:56 I ju- I just can't tell.
03:57:59 No, I can't.
03:57:59 I just can't tell.
03:58:00 I feel like...
03:58:01 I don't know.
03:58:02 I'm kinda inclined...
03:58:03 I'm kind of inclined to believe...
03:58:07 That he is retarded, but like there's like glimmers.
03:58:10 There's like glimmers of understanding just starting to emerge there.
03:58:14 Yeah.
03:58:18 Hmm.
03:58:20 I fucking...
03:58:21 I fucking admire this guy's like...
03:58:23 Drive to like do this.
03:58:26 Like he's...
03:58:26 He's doing something different.
03:58:28 I really appreciate that.
03:58:31 Like does he...
03:58:32 Wait.
03:58:32 Wait a minute.
03:58:35 He doesn't...
03:58:37 He doesn't even have any like episode reviews.
03:58:41 He doesn't.
03:58:44 So like what is he?
03:58:47 What is his purpose?
03:58:49 He's got a...
03:58:50 He's got a couple like podcasts.
03:58:53 Let's see.
03:58:58 Hold on.
03:59:00 Our play...
03:59:02 Oh, I guess this is like a let's play?
03:59:06 Yeah.
03:59:06 Okay.
03:59:06 Okay.
03:59:06 It's like a let's play.
03:59:07 Okay.
03:59:09 Okay.
03:59:09 There was some like...
03:59:10 Actually, it was Dungeon and Dragons.
03:59:13 His latest videos is like a Brony RPG,
03:59:16 which I assume is like a D&D podcast thing or something.
03:59:21 Yeah.
03:59:24 Yeah.
03:59:26 Okay.
03:59:30 Skimming through this.
03:59:31 Okay.
03:59:32 Okay.
03:59:32 Okay.
03:59:32 Okay.
03:59:33 Okay.
03:59:33 Here's what I think.
03:59:36 This is either like a Jayce Conner sort of like deep cover troll.
03:59:41 Or he's like...
03:59:44 He's like a hyper-autist.
03:59:46 Like not just like we've never seen before.
03:59:50 Like like like like and he really has like insane like tapestry woven in his fucking head.
03:59:56 And that just just just just still happens to be to be funny to us.
04:00:01 Yeah.
04:00:01 For all the reasons he intends.
04:00:03 Yeah.
04:00:05 It's...
04:00:08 I just I can't I can't get a read on the guy.
04:00:11 I think...
04:00:12 We have to fucking talk to him.
04:00:14 We have to.
04:00:16 Yeah, I think if we're ever gonna if we're ever...
04:00:18 It's the only way to know for sure.
04:00:20 Yeah.
04:00:21 Wait, what is Dr. Fowle's birthday party?
04:00:23 It's five minutes long.
04:00:24 It's probably another song.
04:00:27 Yeah, probably.
04:00:34 Oh shit, singing.
04:00:37 There's no description apparently?
04:00:41 No, thanks.
04:00:42 I don't want to...
04:00:43 Wait, skip ahead.
04:00:44 Skip ahead.
04:00:45 Okay.
04:00:49 I don't know why it's taking so long to...
04:00:50 Because it's paused, you ding-dong.
04:00:53 Oh, holy shit.
04:00:57 Here.
04:01:04 Yeah, do you want to watch this?
04:01:06 No.
04:01:07 Yeah.
04:01:09 Wait.
04:01:10 Okay, hold on.
04:01:13 Third 40 fucking minutes.
04:01:16 Third 40 fucking minutes.
04:01:21 King of Limba, Dr. Fowle.
04:01:22 Oh, that's a podcast thing.
04:01:25 Oh, okay.
04:01:26 Wait, April Fool is a moment with Dr. Fowle, the movie.
04:01:45 Oh, welcome to Dr. Fowle's death for the mentally impaired.
04:01:57 What's your problem?
04:02:02 Fucking hell.
04:02:04 He's empty.
04:02:05 What's going on?
04:02:06 Does no one have any problems?
04:02:09 Jack looked across the floor of the empty barn
04:02:11 and bled for a leave into Scott's body, still in pain.
04:02:15 Oh, I'm not impressed.
04:02:23 Yeah, let's skip ahead.
04:02:25 It's just this for 13 minutes.
04:02:31 Maybe if we were like listening to like...
04:02:38 You know, I honestly gotta say, I think you may be a retard.
04:02:42 Yeah, maybe if we were like high as shit, bro,
04:02:46 maybe if we were like super fucking stone,
04:02:48 then maybe we'd like get it, you know?
04:02:52 Yeah, that must be it.
04:02:57 He's undoubtedly an interesting character, however.
04:03:02 Yeah, yeah.
04:03:07 I wonder, let's see if Mage said anything.
04:03:10 No.
04:03:12 I wonder, maybe he just featured her because he likes her.
04:03:16 Maybe.
04:03:23 What can you say about Dr. Fowle?
04:03:27 Say what you like.
04:03:29 He's got Cajones.
04:03:33 He's got show, he's got show bits, you know what I'm saying?
04:03:38 He's got show, he's got show...
04:03:39 He's got a cute bird.
04:03:41 He's got show bits and a vice, you know what I'm saying?
04:03:44 I know exactly what you're saying.
04:03:46 Yeah, he's gonna kill you.
04:03:47 He's got a cool character.
04:03:49 Yeah, unlike just, he's almost as cool as TuneCriticY2K.
04:03:54 Almost, I mean, no one can be as cool as him.
04:03:59 All right, Baroni Dance Party, very good.
04:04:03 We gotta see this.
04:04:08 More nothing.
04:04:11 I am going into the fucking...
04:04:16 Oh no, I can't...
04:04:18 I was gonna edit Vita out of the fucking pages and category mail,
04:04:23 but it won't let me, I think I have to have an account
04:04:26 and I'm not fucking willing to make an account.
04:04:29 God damn it.
04:04:29 Yeah, accounts are late.
04:04:32 That's how they fucking get you.
04:04:34 That's how they get you.
04:04:35 I bet you could delete the page too if you had an account.
04:04:42 I'm actually not sure about that.
04:04:44 I think I'm not sure if the leading pages
04:04:46 is even like a thing that Wikis do.
04:04:49 I think they just expand outward forever and ever
04:04:51 and can never be fucking, and can never be clipped.
04:04:56 Let's see who FNGR is.
04:04:58 I have a basic understanding of him and I don't like him.
04:05:02 FNGR is like, I don't know.
04:05:06 He's just like a guy who seems weirdly invested
04:05:11 and trolling people, but is actually...
04:05:15 I've never actually known him to troll anyone.
04:05:18 He just seems to like to be there when people get trolled.
04:05:23 Like he just likes to see people in distress,
04:05:26 but doesn't actually do anything.
04:05:29 What?
04:05:30 That description.
04:05:33 He just likes to be there when shit goes bad.
04:05:38 He's just like invested in drama,
04:05:40 but I don't know of him actually causing any.
04:05:43 Maybe he does, I don't know.
04:05:46 For no good reason, or FNGR for short.
04:05:48 He likes to like...
04:05:49 The biggest drama lightning rods in the community.
04:05:52 He likes to poke people and prod them
04:05:55 and try and make them mad about stuff
04:05:58 that like other people did.
04:06:02 Although he refers to himself as a Dallas,
04:06:04 he spends more time making his limbo podcasts
04:06:08 as well as weekly commentary on the Brony drama titled
04:06:11 How Not to Brony.
04:06:15 He's an FPFC member.
04:06:16 I don't know what that is.
04:06:17 Pony fuck casts.
04:06:21 Oh, you know what?
04:06:23 Oh man, me, I have no fucking clue why.
04:06:28 I think it was FNGR himself, or maybe it was Vita
04:06:30 that added me to the Pony fuck cast Skype call.
04:06:34 Yeah.
04:06:35 And I joined in.
04:06:36 They did that to me once too.
04:06:39 Me and my friend just recited the history
04:06:41 of the Byzantium Empire to them.
04:06:44 And it was incredible.
04:06:46 The entire time I was playing mariachi music in the background.
04:06:52 It was great.
04:06:54 I see he's got a Patreon.
04:06:57 Yeah.
04:06:58 I wanna see his YouTube.
04:07:02 How many subs?
04:07:03 Like 3,000?
04:07:05 Yeah, like 3,000.
04:07:10 How not?
04:07:12 I hold on.
04:07:16 Yeah.
04:07:17 What is this about Digi drama in the Brony community?
04:07:20 That seems strange.
04:07:21 It's a yo.
04:07:24 That's fucking why.
04:07:27 Why 40 minutes?
04:07:31 Oh, here, here.
04:07:32 The best thing they fucking added to YouTube.
04:07:34 Hold on.
04:07:38 Did you see how he misspelled following?
04:07:41 Yeah.
04:07:57 What?
04:08:04 All right, I don't care anymore.
04:08:05 Yeah, this sucks.
04:08:07 This sucks and it's gay.
04:08:09 One time, I even, someone linked me like the videos that he did,
04:08:13 like specifically about me or like about the PCP.
04:08:16 And I didn't care about that either because it sucked.
04:08:23 Oh God, Munchie.
04:08:24 I don't think I can do anymore.
04:08:26 I'm on death's door.
04:08:29 Hold on, hold on.
04:08:30 I'm here.
04:08:31 No, have mercy.
04:08:33 I don't know what's the trailer.
04:08:34 Actually, no, I don't want to.
04:08:36 I actually don't want to.
04:08:39 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
04:08:39 Actually, go back.
04:08:40 I just saw fucking keg standard.
04:08:43 What?
04:08:47 What?
04:08:48 What?
04:08:49 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
04:08:53 Did you?
04:08:54 You know what?
04:08:55 What is this?
04:08:55 I actually knew about this.
04:08:57 I remember this.
04:08:58 Hold on.
04:09:25 Okay, don't care.
04:09:48 I'm glad.
04:09:49 I'm so glad, Munchie.
04:09:50 I'm so glad that we read about the lore of,
04:09:54 not past analysis, a voice of reason so that we know about horror scores.
04:10:00 So I understood that reference.
04:10:02 I'm so, I'm so fucking happy that this part of our lives is fucking over with.
04:10:10 Yeah, it's died down.
04:10:16 I think, I think probably a lot of these people have moved on, but not all of them.
04:10:22 Man, we saw a couple of YouTube channels and they all updated pretty recently.
04:10:27 Yeah.
04:10:28 What's, what's tune critic up to?
04:10:32 Tune?
04:10:34 I just, this person deserves the worst that the world can throw at him.
04:10:42 Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see.
04:10:49 Look at his fucking avatar.
04:10:51 He's got a beard now.
04:10:56 16 hours ago.
04:10:59 I can't fucking believe that.
04:11:01 Does this guy have a Patreon?
04:11:05 Obviously.
04:11:06 Obviously.
04:11:08 I'm bracing for it.
04:11:10 I'm bracing for it.
04:11:13 Let's fucking see it.
04:11:14 Come on.
04:11:16 Oh, well, I'm impressed a little.

04:11:51 churn out whatever it is that he does.
