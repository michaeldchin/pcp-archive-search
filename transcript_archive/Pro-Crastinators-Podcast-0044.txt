00:00:10 When two cousins set sail across the Sea of Cortez, they expect the weather to be blue skies and fair winds all the way.
00:00:19 But when an unexpected storm blows in off the mountains, their boat is torn apart and they're dumped in shark infested waters.
00:00:29 Oh my God! Oh my God!
00:00:32 There are only refugees in uninhabited islands where there is no food, no water, and no shelter from the burning sun.
00:00:41 All they have left is the will to survive and the hope that that will be enough on I Shouldn't Be Alive.
00:00:51 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:56 We're back again to talk about things.
00:00:59 Woo! Yeah!
00:01:02 I like things.
00:01:05 I was about to say that.
00:01:08 I stole his thunder.
00:01:10 Donnie, how could you betray me like that, Donnie?
00:01:14 Donnie, how could you get your own catchphrase wrong?
00:01:18 I like your own brother, the spicy key chain, Donnie.
00:01:22 I am the best guy ever, as you know.
00:01:25 The coolest cat in the cabbage patch.
00:01:29 That's me. That's my new catchphrase.
00:01:32 And I'm joined today by my good buddies, Hippocrite is here.
00:01:37 Hello.
00:01:38 As is Ben Saint.
00:01:40 Oh.
00:01:42 Distinctly not my buddy, you'll notice.
00:01:44 And my good friend, Jessicaleys.
00:01:47 Endless Jessicaleys.
00:01:48 Jessicaleys, named after my testicles.
00:01:51 You named after your own testicle.
00:01:56 The testicle is cometh before the name.
00:01:59 And Tom Oliver.
00:02:00 Yeah, I do.
00:02:02 All right, buddy.
00:02:04 Okay, so here's our topic. Let's not fuck around.
00:02:07 Our topic was a suggestion by this guy on Twitter.
00:02:11 He goes by at the Hippocrite.
00:02:14 Here's a suggestion.
00:02:16 At TP Crastinators, I am dying help.
00:02:20 A podcast on when you almost died.
00:02:23 So that's a good question.
00:02:26 Yes, we got to get that guy on here sometime.
00:02:29 We probably should.
00:02:31 Hey, are we going to get accused of what's the word, nepotism?
00:02:33 Is this not cool to take questions from people that you may or may not know?
00:02:37 Ah, fuck it. Fuck you, Twitter.
00:02:39 Nobody knows who actually runs the Hippocrite Twitter.
00:02:42 It wasn't me, that's for sure.
00:02:45 And by the way, peeps, make sure that you send us questions
00:02:48 about topic suggestions throughout the week.
00:02:50 But especially on Saturdays when we record these things
00:02:53 at TP Crastinators.
00:02:55 So go do that because we always need more.
00:02:57 Anyway, we're out of topics.
00:03:00 I mean, we're all washed up.
00:03:02 We're on our last legs here.
00:03:04 You guys got to step up or this shit.
00:03:06 We're going to hit the ground real hard.
00:03:08 We're coming in for a real rough landing.
00:03:11 You know Denzel Washington and that movie Flight
00:03:14 where he has to flip the plane and they do all this crazy shit
00:03:16 and then there was a big, there was a big trial about like malpractice
00:03:19 as a pilot and I don't want to, I don't want to lose my kids, okay?
00:03:22 I don't want to lose my seven sexy daughters.
00:03:24 So please send me your suggestions TP Crastinators.
00:03:27 That's what I need to do.
00:03:29 Hippo, I'm feeling like you might have some suggestions
00:03:32 for times that you were almost dying.
00:03:35 Yeah, I'm right now, I'm in the moment of death.
00:03:39 I'm dying currently on the stream, on live because
00:03:43 I don't know what I have and it's the weekend so I can't go to the doctors
00:03:46 and it's something about my throat.
00:03:48 Is that how that works?
00:03:49 Well, I don't know, maybe.
00:03:51 Maybe they just, they probably go home.
00:03:53 I just assumed I can't access the medical guy.
00:03:57 That can't be right, right?
00:03:59 I mean, I'm sure hospitals are open, right, because they're always open.
00:04:01 Yeah, hospitals are always open.
00:04:02 But like the doctors are only on...
00:04:05 Doctors appointment, checkup or whatever.
00:04:08 That immediately strikes me as fully retarded, but yeah.
00:04:12 I'm probably wrong, but anyway.
00:04:14 I have been having trouble breathing and for the last few days
00:04:17 I've been trying all sorts of things to try and stop it from making me not sleep
00:04:21 and cough all night and I don't like it.
00:04:24 So the problem is like your throat is like constricting?
00:04:27 What I thought it was was that my room was too dusty so I cleaned my room for a whole day
00:04:31 and then I went to bed and I was like all night so I was like, no, that's not it.
00:04:37 So it's like, maybe it's a cold.
00:04:40 So today I woke up really late because I couldn't sleep.
00:04:43 I woke up at 6 p.m. and I put like this weird, like I don't know what it's called, Vicks Vapor Rub.
00:04:51 Yeah, yeah.
00:04:52 And you put that in a bowl of hot water and you put your head over it with a towel
00:04:56 and you just breathe that in for like an hour.
00:04:58 So you don't actually involve rubbing on your body anywhere?
00:05:02 Vicks Vapor Rub?
00:05:03 I thought you were supposed to rub it on your chest
00:05:05 and then let the vapors rise up from the chest?
00:05:07 That's how you do it for like putting it at sleep time.
00:05:11 But you can, like it's more intense to just put a bowl of hot water and drink that up
00:05:17 or sniff that up.
00:05:19 How's that working out?
00:05:20 It didn't do shit so it's obviously not like something in my throat.
00:05:23 It is my throat itself has decided to close and I don't know how to do anything about it.
00:05:28 Okay, I've got a suggestion.
00:05:30 Oh God, I've got a suggestion.
00:05:33 So you basically, you need to widen up that passageway.
00:05:37 I have a tool, a cylindrical tool.
00:05:39 I have a cylindrical tool.
00:05:40 No, Nate.
00:05:41 That's pretty long.
00:05:42 Nate?
00:05:43 I think we can widen that thing up.
00:05:44 Nate, that's enough.
00:05:45 Get that in there.
00:05:46 That's enough.
00:05:47 You're gay now, Kim.
00:05:48 You're gay now.
00:05:49 I got you.
00:05:50 I got him.
00:05:51 I tried to stop him.
00:05:53 You know, I also, when I've been out for runs over the last, I don't know, like six months
00:05:57 or whatever, very occasionally I will get a thing where I just like my lungs don't seem
00:06:01 to be absorbing the oxygen I'm breathing.
00:06:03 And I have to do these big like, I have to like force my lungs to expand and contract.
00:06:08 It's really weird.
00:06:09 I wonder if it's the same thing that you're having right now.
00:06:11 I don't, I don't know what caused it.
00:06:13 I'm afraid I might have asthma.
00:06:14 Cause my dad has asthma.
00:06:15 I'm afraid I might have asthma cause I don't want to be a nerd.
00:06:18 Yeah.
00:06:19 I don't want to carry one of those little things go, and be, you know, the guy who gets beat up on,
00:06:25 and stand by me.
00:06:26 I already have glasses.
00:06:27 I'm halfway there.
00:06:28 I don't want to, I don't want to do that.
00:06:30 You need some headgear too.
00:06:31 Hey, did you guys know that I wore a headgear all of like elementary school for one full year?
00:06:35 I was just thinking, just the other day I was thinking about the fact that I completely forgot that you wore headgear for a while.
00:06:40 It's like the fun.
00:06:41 I opted in.
00:06:42 And you kept hitting yourself.
00:06:43 It's hilarious.
00:06:44 No.
00:06:45 Okay.
00:06:46 So this was, this was purely a teeth straightening thing.
00:06:47 And I was offered a choice to either wear headgear at night for like two years, or just wear it all the time for one year.
00:06:54 And I'd be done sooner.
00:06:55 And I just, I didn't even register any negative consequences of wearing it, you know, for a whole fucking year in school.
00:07:01 Of course I'll wear a weird apparatus on my head at all times.
00:07:03 I can't believe I did it, but I fucking wore that thing an entire year straight.
00:07:07 It's obviously worked, because you don't have crooked fucking teeth like did you?
00:07:11 That's true.
00:07:12 Did you get some headgear?
00:07:13 Shout out to Digi's teeth.
00:07:17 I had, I had some weird orthodontia.
00:07:20 I had braces.
00:07:21 Did you get the palette expander?
00:07:22 Yeah, yeah.
00:07:23 I had braces for a while, but before that I had the palette expander, which is a thing that...
00:07:26 Orthodontia sounds like, like the realm where dentists come from.
00:07:30 I'm sure it is.
00:07:32 It goes on your teeth and it like, it like attaches to your top teeth.
00:07:36 And there's like, it's like a flat thing in the middle, but there's a gap in it.
00:07:40 And there's a little twisty thing.
00:07:41 And you have a little key and you jam this little key up into your roof of your mouth in this apparatus.
00:07:46 And you twist it like a couple of times and it gradually expands your fucking jaw.
00:07:51 And you do that for a while.
00:07:53 I had that.
00:07:54 And I also had another thing where like, it was these like metal things where like bonded to my teeth.
00:07:59 And on the top row were these rods, these metal rods.
00:08:02 And on the bottom row were these metal tubes and the rods slotted into the tubes.
00:08:07 And it was intended so that my jaw would open and close in like a straight line instead of like a curvy line.
00:08:13 And the thing about that is as I got older, I eventually became able to open my mouth so wide
00:08:18 that I could unhing, that I could remove the tube, the rods from the tubes.
00:08:22 And then I could have, and then I would have these four weird little like, these weird little like straight metal dealy things
00:08:29 that I could pop out of my mouth and like wiggle around like a, like a, like a, like a, like a beep.
00:08:35 Like a metal vampire man.
00:08:36 Like a pencil, like a bug mouth pincer.
00:08:38 But then I would open up again and I would jam them back in because, you know, I wanted to keep my orthodontia working properly.
00:08:43 That would take them out for fun.
00:08:45 Anyway, that was weird.
00:08:46 On the topic of times I almost died, the orthodontist is a very relevant one.
00:08:51 Wait a minute.
00:08:52 Man, it's fucked up the stuff we do to our fucking jaw and skull.
00:08:55 I mean, it makes sense.
00:08:56 Like you get good results and all.
00:08:57 It's because our bodies suck.
00:08:59 Yeah.
00:09:00 Your bodies don't look right on their own.
00:09:02 It's just crazy.
00:09:03 It's weird because I've never heard of, you know, I mean, stuff like that being done in England.
00:09:07 Like the most you would get is braces.
00:09:09 Well, the whole, the whole T thing in England is a big meme, right?
00:09:12 Sometimes buzzer nature just needs a little help.
00:09:15 I think what it's, what the difference is, is that Americans don't like having fucked up teeth, even if it's healthy.
00:09:22 They just want it to be a certain shape.
00:09:24 We're just insanely superficial over here.
00:09:25 It's definitely a superficiality.
00:09:27 In America, you're expected to have nice teeth.
00:09:29 I know I'm superficial as fuck.
00:09:31 Like I'm just lucky that my teeth and jaw are just sort of normal.
00:09:34 So there's no problems there really.
00:09:36 Yeah, you could be a digi.
00:09:37 Oh boy.
00:09:38 Oh boy.
00:09:40 I actually was supposed to get braces and shit from my teeth and I didn't because we couldn't afford it.
00:09:44 My dentist or whoever, I remember as a kid was like, if you don't do this, when you're old, you're, because I have like a really bad overbite.
00:09:51 You're like, your overbite is going to get so bad.
00:09:53 Your bottom teeth are going to start digging into the gums of your top teeth and all your top teeth are just going to fall out.
00:09:57 What the fuck?
00:09:58 Did, did that happen?
00:09:59 Holy shit, that's exaggeration.
00:10:00 So I've never, I've never.
00:10:01 It did?
00:10:02 Wait, it did?
00:10:03 Well, it had, I haven't been asked if that really happened.
00:10:06 It hasn't happened yet, but I don't know how, how, how far into the future he was talking about.
00:10:10 Times ticking.
00:10:11 So I'll definitely, I'll update it on that because like, I never had wisdom teeth removed.
00:10:15 I never had braces.
00:10:16 Never had any of that shit.
00:10:17 So I'm out.
00:10:18 Yeah, you can still get it done when you're older, I think.
00:10:20 So it's not like the end of the world or anything.
00:10:22 Yeah.
00:10:23 But they have like the like Invisalign things now.
00:10:25 If you want to get braces, but nobody knows.
00:10:27 I do, I do have, I do have in, in Boy Scouts when I was like in high school or middle school, I did have a bike accident that broke my two front teeth.
00:10:35 Oh yeah.
00:10:36 I remember that.
00:10:37 So now like half of, well half of one of my front teeth and a little part of the other is like, you know, it's like fake tooth and like it's fine.
00:10:44 It looks fine, except I guess it's just, I've had it long enough that like the edges just kind of like the edge of the fake part is kind of starting to get a little dingy looking and it really, it really pisses me off.
00:10:55 It really pisses me off every time I look at it.
00:10:58 The whole thing about like our vanity in regards to our teeth and making them like white enough, like I've been drinking more coffee recently and I have been getting extremely concerned.
00:11:06 If my teeth will turn darker, get stained because I have always been very proud of my teeth and I've gotten a lot of compliments on my smile and my teeth over the years and it's entirely a vanity thing.
00:11:17 But I would be very upset if my teeth were to diminish in quality.
00:11:21 I don't know man.
00:11:22 I wonder.
00:11:23 Yeah, I don't know.
00:11:24 I worry about that too.
00:11:25 It's all kind of pointless.
00:11:26 I don't drink a lot of coffee, but I do drink a lot of just like Mio.
00:11:29 Yeah.
00:11:30 I drink a lot of Mio energy.
00:11:31 You'll have rainbow colored teeth.
00:11:33 Oh, beautiful, beautiful.
00:11:35 I guess that's why my teeth aren't fucked up because I don't drink soda ever.
00:11:39 But you drink tea.
00:11:40 Tea's not.
00:11:41 Tea's got to be better than soda.
00:11:43 Tea's not that dark.
00:11:44 Tea's definitely not that bad for you at all.
00:11:46 I mean like in terms of like teeth rotting because like, I mean they might stay brown with teas, stain, I don't know.
00:11:52 Yeah, that's all I meant.
00:11:54 Soda will make them disintegrate.
00:11:57 Soda's bad.
00:11:58 Yeah, that's what they say.
00:12:00 Soda's bad in every way and know what you drink it.
00:12:02 I bought a water today and I got a soda instead.
00:12:06 Well, the President of Nintendo RIP.
00:12:08 Dumped it in the trash because it is trash.
00:12:10 Wait, what?
00:12:11 What about Nintendo?
00:12:12 You said you got a water.
00:12:14 The President of Nintendo RIP.
00:12:16 He did, nigga.
00:12:17 He did.
00:12:18 He is.
00:12:19 Wait a minute.
00:12:20 Dig up his grave, you monster.
00:12:21 I did.
00:12:22 I kissed that.
00:12:23 Okay.
00:12:24 This has nothing to do with death dying times and what?
00:12:28 The death we were referring to.
00:12:31 Nate, we actually said what the topic is.
00:12:36 I feel like you said the topic before but we never actually introduced what the topic is.
00:12:42 Okay, I read the question but the topic is in between.
00:12:46 That's right.
00:12:47 Okay.
00:12:48 Yeah.
00:12:49 Times when you almost died or whatever.
00:12:51 With Hippo talking about how he's dying right now and then we just tangent into dental incidents.
00:12:57 I do have another time that I actually almost died.
00:13:00 Please.
00:13:01 Okay, cool.
00:13:02 I mean, maybe I was panicking at the time and I'm overreacting about what happened.
00:13:07 But there was a time when I was just out on a trek on a hike just around the countryside with family.
00:13:14 And I had a cold at the time and it was kind of cold outside but whatever.
00:13:19 But there was this moment where I had so much mucus in my throat that I could not sneeze it out.
00:13:26 I could not cough it up and it completely blocked my air passages and I fell over.
00:13:31 Oh, God.
00:13:32 And I just was like, I was trying as hard as I could to gasp for air and it wouldn't happen.
00:13:37 Oh, my God.
00:13:38 And I nearly fainted and it was the scariest moment ever.
00:13:41 That reminds me.
00:13:42 There is, okay, one of the worst things I've ever read is there's a scene in Infinite Jess
00:13:47 where a burglar, okay, a guy, like this rich diplomat, he was going to take a family vacation that day
00:13:59 but he was sick, right?
00:14:01 He had a cold.
00:14:02 So his family left and he stayed home because he was sick.
00:14:06 And a burglar or two burglars knew that his family was taking a vacation and they were going to break in that day.
00:14:13 But they break in and find that he's still there, sick.
00:14:16 So they're like, oh, shit, what do we do?
00:14:18 So they tie him up and they gag him.
00:14:20 Oh, no.
00:14:21 And the thing is, he's got a stuffy nose and like, yeah.
00:14:26 This has been my nightmare, my entire fucking life.
00:14:29 Literally this.
00:14:30 It takes him like an entire day to die.
00:14:33 Oh, God, no.
00:14:35 No.
00:14:36 No.
00:14:37 No.
00:14:38 You don't know how long I've had this exact thought.
00:14:40 Like, what if I, guys, I've got a stuffy nose.
00:14:42 They're like, well, just shut up and nobody cares.
00:14:44 What if I get kidnapped right now?
00:14:46 I've had the fear of someone literally putting duct tape on my mouth has been my exact fear my entire life.
00:14:53 No.
00:14:54 No.
00:14:55 Why kidnapping specifically?
00:14:56 Because I understand.
00:14:57 He spends like the entire day like fucking snorting and blowing his nose and trying to keep the nasal passages clear.
00:15:04 Trying to breathe.
00:15:05 And he like sort of manages it for a while.
00:15:07 But like he can't.
00:15:08 Yeah.
00:15:09 Yeah, it's really bad.
00:15:10 Jesus, Jesus, you fucked up, dude.
00:15:13 You should not have fucked with our lungs that way.
00:15:15 Why'd you make me this way, Jesus?
00:15:17 I hate you.
00:15:18 Fuck you, dude.
00:15:19 Fuck you.
00:15:20 Yeah, it's pretty bad.
00:15:21 It's pretty fucking bad.
00:15:22 It's a similar like sort of fear of just being in a place where you can't call for help.
00:15:27 Yeah.
00:15:28 Like, you know, it's something like, you know, the fear of like falling asleep in the bath and just drowning because nobody knows.
00:15:35 Oh, God.
00:15:36 Yeah.
00:15:37 Or you fall over in the shower.
00:15:38 It's like a mundane sort of sort of way to die that could happen at any moment if you're just not able to move.
00:15:45 Yeah, I'm with you.
00:15:46 But for me, it's like even worse if like if you're just like in a crowd, but like I don't know for whatever reason, if you like choke on your own snot or maybe even like a piece of food.
00:15:56 Like if nobody knows and they're around or even if they do know, but like it's you like fighting against your own body and your own biology and like just no one can like fix you immediately.
00:16:05 Like they have to rush you to the hospital to if they can like so you can try to reach down and pull it out or whatever.
00:16:09 Yeah.
00:16:10 But just like that fear of like me being powerless against my own body, I find particularly terrifying, especially for like the suffocation thing.
00:16:18 Oh, God, no.
00:16:20 Oh, that's the worst.
00:16:21 This is going to be an awkward podcast.
00:16:24 I'm thinking about suffocating now and I've really got, I've really got the fucking, the fucking, the howling.
00:16:29 I've got the goose pimples back.
00:16:31 The howling fantasies.
00:16:32 Everybody take a deep breath.
00:16:33 David Foster Wallace would say.
00:16:34 This, this, this entire topic is why I'm such a huge advocate of transhumanism.
00:16:39 We need to fucking get robot bodies, fix all this shit.
00:16:42 This is the worst.
00:16:43 The best thing about being a robot.
00:16:45 Sure would be neat.
00:16:46 Sure would be neat.
00:16:47 The coolest thing about robots and robotics is that I mean, if you're a cyborg, you can probably like turn yourself off and then turn yourself on again.
00:16:56 So if you repairs will be easier.
00:16:58 I can already turn myself on.
00:16:59 Thank you very much.
00:17:00 Oh, sure.
00:17:01 You can make yourself unconscious for sure.
00:17:02 Whoa.
00:17:03 Yeah, it just takes this rock to my head and I'm out.
00:17:06 It's great.
00:17:07 But, um, but like also like little robot, like I always like the idea that we're like advancing in like micro technology with robots and stuff and tiny little things.
00:17:19 Cause like in the future, you won't have to have surgery or anything.
00:17:22 If there's something inside you that's going wrong, you can just send a little robot guy in there to dig it out with a spade, you know.
00:17:30 To dig it out with a spade.
00:17:32 Little lasers or little drills, like just send them in there.
00:17:35 I just, I just, I want there to be artificial organs, artificial, just like body parts that can easily be swapped out that don't cost like dig.
00:17:45 It's just like, oh, you're having a heart attack.
00:17:47 Well, let's just put a new heart in there.
00:17:48 I guess that one's fucked up, you know, and just easily fix all that shit.
00:17:52 And then I want like fucking nano machines to fucking like augment your, your organs and stuff that can like repair damaged cells.
00:18:01 And, and, and you can just live forever.
00:18:03 And, and, and aging is just a different sort of thing.
00:18:08 I mean, I'm a little more concerned about the technology for micro machines that, you know, enable dick extension and retraction on command.
00:18:15 They just build cells, you know, like I assume that's what everyone was thinking about.
00:18:20 The ultimate technology.
00:18:21 No, in the future, in the future, you're not going to need to worry about your dick size because you're going to have your robot wife who's perfect in every way.
00:18:31 And she doesn't care how big your dick is.
00:18:33 It's always the perfect fit because she's designed.
00:18:35 And, and plus, once we get the full ghost on the shelf thing, you can just swap into a body with as big a dick you want or whatever.
00:18:40 Listen, listen asshole, listen asshole.
00:18:42 I don't want, I don't want a big dick for her sake.
00:18:44 I want a big dick for my sake.
00:18:46 I want a big dick because I enjoy it.
00:18:48 I enjoy it.
00:18:49 Because you deserve it, Ben, because you deserve it.
00:18:52 You think this is for them?
00:18:54 You think I do, you think I do this for them?
00:18:56 You think I jelk every day?
00:18:58 You think I jelk to satisfy a woman?
00:19:01 You think these kegels are for her dog?
00:19:03 Who satisfies me?
00:19:05 This is, this is, this is what I need to feel, to feel like a man.
00:19:09 And god damn it I do.
00:19:11 Ben said gesturing to his physique, just brushing his body.
00:19:15 Yeah, you think all this is for Ben?
00:19:17 All this?
00:19:19 Look at these curves dog.
00:19:21 Hippo, did you have any other death defying incidents that you wanted to bring up?
00:19:25 Or Shelly Moomunda, somebody else?
00:19:27 I can't think of any. There's been, yeah.
00:19:31 If you think about it, you can always bring them up.
00:19:33 Yeah, I'll just, I was gonna mention, Jess, you've been like having a bit of medical stuff.
00:19:41 Also, you're homeless and everything sucks.
00:19:44 Oh yeah, I have AIDS.
00:19:46 I thought everyone knew, I thought everyone, you saw what happened with me and Action Giraffe at Radcon 2.
00:19:56 You saw the AIDS get transmitted through the docking station into my brain.
00:20:04 That's what Action Giraffe does.
00:20:08 Made of AIDS. I'm not a human being anymore.
00:20:11 As Action Giraffe was fucking your ear hole, there was a sudden time stop.
00:20:17 There was like a freeze frame and then the AIDS crawled out and went inside like a yerk, like a yerk for animals.
00:20:23 I'm not really like a human anymore.
00:20:26 And Resident Evil Zero, how the zombies are made out of leeches.
00:20:31 I'm like a bunch of AIDS leeches, like morphing and swapping around in the form of an AIDS-y human.
00:20:38 Particularly AIDS-y human, more so than any other of my ilk.
00:20:46 I have a time, I wasn't actually nearly dying, but I thought I was and it was bullshit.
00:20:55 This was like, I don't know, I think I had allergies or something. This was in my teen years, Nate.
00:21:01 And I remember on this particular Sunday, we were going to church.
00:21:06 And I don't think you were there, I don't know why, whatever.
00:21:09 Because I'm a goddamn pizza-faced atheist.
00:21:12 I don't know, you were somewhere, it doesn't matter, you're not relevant to the story.
00:21:16 The story is, yeah I know, fuck you.
00:21:18 The story is that I had allergies or something and I took a Benadryl, right?
00:21:23 Like my mom or dad gave me a Benadryl and I was like, I still feel kind of bad.
00:21:27 So I took like another one, like I took two Benadryls and I felt weird, like I started to feel tingly.
00:21:34 And I was like, oh, you know, dad, I took two Benadryls and now I-
00:21:39 Just kill me dad, please.
00:21:41 I was like dad, I took two Benadryls because the first one didn't really work and now I feel weird.
00:21:46 And dad was like, oh god, Ben, you took two Benadryls, you could die.
00:21:51 You could die, Ben.
00:21:53 Oh my god.
00:21:55 He said like, if you do that, you could die.
00:21:57 And I was like, oh god, should we go to the hospital?
00:22:00 Dad, and he was like, nah.
00:22:05 What the fuck, dad?
00:22:06 You handled this situation, you're escalating it as hard as you possibly could.
00:22:10 And you should be like, ah, don't worry about it.
00:22:12 Yeah, yeah, yeah, he told me that what I had done could kill me.
00:22:16 And then when I was like, should we do something?
00:22:18 He was like, no, it's fine.
00:22:20 And then we went to church and I sat there in the fucking pew feeling weird,
00:22:25 feeling kind of tingly and thinking I was gonna die.
00:22:28 Just feeling closer to God than you ever have before, yeah.
00:22:31 Put that fear of God in me for sure.
00:22:33 He would never strike me down in his own house, would he?
00:22:36 Oh my god.
00:22:38 You know, dad is like the worst, he assumes the worst in every situation.
00:22:42 You know dad, he's very melodramatic.
00:22:44 At least, if you really thought that.
00:22:47 Yeah, that's the thing, if he really thought that was the case,
00:22:49 he would have taken to the hospital.
00:22:51 So clearly, I don't know.
00:22:53 He clearly didn't actually think I was in danger, but like, he still said it.
00:22:56 He said it and then did not.
00:22:58 The seed was planted at that point.
00:23:00 He did not walk the statement back at any point.
00:23:03 What a legend, dad.
00:23:05 I can imagine he just wanted you to freak out so he could laugh.
00:23:08 Maybe he did, maybe he just wanted to scare me into not take doubling up on doses.
00:23:14 But you know, I don't feel like there was any premeditated strategy going on here.
00:23:19 Who can predict the inner workings of a dad?
00:23:22 It's impossible.
00:23:26 Well, that's interesting.
00:23:28 Well, since we're on you, you got any others?
00:23:30 Mmm, yeah.
00:23:32 I was at home jerking off.
00:23:34 Yeah, fuck yeah.
00:23:36 What else you got for us, Ben, any other times?
00:23:39 Oh, again?
00:23:41 Well, yeah, I actually do have a second one.
00:23:43 I was going to save it, but yeah.
00:23:45 We could go around if you want, we could do a round robin or whatever.
00:23:47 All right, well, I'll tell you the whole story,
00:23:50 because there's a bit more to it than just the death.
00:23:52 So in college, right, like me and my girlfriend had some friends
00:23:56 that had been going to the same school, but then they transferred to another school.
00:24:00 This was another couple.
00:24:02 One of them transferred to another school, they went together,
00:24:05 and we were going to go visit them.
00:24:07 So we rented a car and we drove to New York,
00:24:10 and it was like a several, like four or five hour drive or something.
00:24:13 And I remember on the way there, like I accidentally ran a red light.
00:24:18 And the girlfriend was like, you know, she was really mad.
00:24:22 Like she was really angry that I had like fucked up
00:24:24 and kind of like done this weird thing in this red light.
00:24:27 And like, yeah, it was dangerous and I fucked up and it was bad.
00:24:31 But she was very upset at my driving.
00:24:33 So then on the way back, she drove.
00:24:36 And she was in the right lane,
00:24:41 and there was an 18-wheeler in the middle lane, right, like next to us.
00:24:46 She got spooked being like sandwiched between this 18-wheeler
00:24:51 and the edge of the road.
00:24:53 This is why women shouldn't be able to drive.
00:24:55 Can't handle it, can't handle it.
00:24:57 This is just my fucking data.
00:24:59 I'm not saying anything, but...
00:25:01 This is just one data point.
00:25:03 And she, you know, hit the gas,
00:25:07 she tried to pull out ahead of the 18-wheeler
00:25:10 and then changed lanes to get in front of it.
00:25:12 She changed lanes too early and fucking...
00:25:15 Fucking just rammed into the thing.
00:25:17 Yes.
00:25:19 And this fucking 18-wheeler, like, crunched into the fucking car.
00:25:24 All of the windows exploded.
00:25:26 What?
00:25:27 Yeah, there was...
00:25:28 Holy shit.
00:25:29 The windows exploded.
00:25:30 She was like screaming, she was like,
00:25:32 Ben, Ben, and I was like, oh god, oh god.
00:25:34 And Ben was like, oh, this is why I told you
00:25:36 I shouldn't have let a man drive.
00:25:38 No, I think I like fucking...
00:25:40 I think I like held her hand or something,
00:25:42 because we were like...
00:25:43 Because it was long.
00:25:45 This was an extended sequence of the windows exploded
00:25:48 and then the car was dragged.
00:25:51 Like, yeah, the car was...
00:25:53 We fucking were attached to the front of this truck now
00:25:57 and the truck had to come to a stop
00:25:59 and we were like sideways.
00:26:01 We were dragged the whole way as this...
00:26:03 as this truck fucking came to a slow stop.
00:26:06 And then, you know, it slowed down
00:26:09 and we were like, oh god, we're still alive.
00:26:12 And like, the windows were everywhere.
00:26:14 There was glass in my pockets
00:26:16 that I found the next day
00:26:18 because it had gotten into my fucking pockets.
00:26:21 And...
00:26:23 Yeah.
00:26:24 They're decaying that Ben, in fact, did not change his clothes
00:26:26 at that point or any other time.
00:26:28 It was wearing a jacket.
00:26:29 Yeah, all right, all right.
00:26:30 And whatever.
00:26:31 And, you know, we called fucking AT...
00:26:35 What's the word?
00:26:36 AAA, AAA.
00:26:37 Yeah, we called AAA and fucking they came
00:26:40 and it was terrible.
00:26:42 And I remember that I had a thermodynamics test
00:26:45 the next day that I really needed to study for,
00:26:47 but because this shitty thing happened,
00:26:49 I did not get home in time to fucking get my textbooks
00:26:52 and study this shit I needed to study.
00:26:54 Did you get an extension on the exam or anything?
00:26:56 No, I just didn't feel like it.
00:26:58 I was just like, fuck it, whatever.
00:27:00 I'll take the test anyway and I didn't do great,
00:27:02 but who cares.
00:27:03 Fair enough, fair enough.
00:27:04 Yeah, everyone was like...
00:27:05 Oh boy.
00:27:06 The teachers the next day were like,
00:27:08 I heard you were in a bad car accident.
00:27:10 And I was like, yeah, that was, it's fine.
00:27:13 I'm just saying women might not be the best drivers around.
00:27:15 That's all I'm saying.
00:27:16 Ben was an advocate from that point on.
00:27:18 In this case, she didn't really hit it out of the park.
00:27:22 Well, Ben, I was curious though,
00:27:24 what your conversation was like immediately after this accident.
00:27:27 What, you know...
00:27:28 I mean, I don't know.
00:27:29 I think we were both just like really happy to be alive.
00:27:33 You know, that's fair.
00:27:34 That's fair.
00:27:35 And also like, you know, just bummed that it had happened
00:27:38 and that we now had to deal with the fall.
00:27:40 It was mostly her, because it was like...
00:27:42 No, it was her car.
00:27:43 It was her car that she had done this to.
00:27:45 So it was like mostly her.
00:27:47 She had to deal with the fall out of fucking messing up her car.
00:27:50 So that was sad.
00:27:52 Man, that's a crazy story.
00:27:55 It was a real fucking scary, almost sad.
00:27:59 We both did.
00:28:01 Man, all right.
00:28:02 Well, cool.
00:28:03 Good story, Ben.
00:28:04 Got any more? Got any others?
00:28:06 I think that I just...
00:28:08 Was that the topper?
00:28:09 That's the...
00:28:10 It might be.
00:28:11 It might have been so far.
00:28:12 I don't think I have anything in the topper.
00:28:13 Another successful PCP podcast.
00:28:15 We did it.
00:28:16 No, we're not...
00:28:17 28 minutes.
00:28:18 No, we've reached the top
00:28:19 and now we have to plunge back into the ground
00:28:21 to go below the bottom point.
00:28:24 I think we can talk about,
00:28:25 unless anyone has another like actual almost died story.
00:28:29 I mean, I'm constantly...
00:28:31 Plunge into the metaphorical.
00:28:32 Like when you...
00:28:33 When you died inside.
00:28:35 Well, wait a minute.
00:28:36 That's every day of my fucking life, dude.
00:28:38 We can get to that.
00:28:39 That's not even worth mentioning at this point.
00:28:41 It's just a given for every day.
00:28:43 I died once.
00:28:44 I was run over by a car once.
00:28:47 Yeah?
00:28:48 Hang on.
00:28:49 When people say they got run over,
00:28:50 a lot of the time I find that the actual event
00:28:52 is that a car hit them
00:28:53 and they rolled over the top.
00:28:55 Oh, no.
00:28:56 That's not what I mean.
00:28:57 I mean, I was literally under the tires
00:28:59 being ran over by a fucking jeep.
00:29:01 Fuck.
00:29:02 Is this why you love Jeep Wrangler so much?
00:29:04 Do you have Stockholm Center for Jeeps?
00:29:06 Is that what's going on?
00:29:07 Is that it, Jesse?
00:29:08 It's okay.
00:29:09 You can admit this problem.
00:29:10 Okay.
00:29:11 So what happened?
00:29:12 What happened?
00:29:13 My stupid idiot friend back in high school named Ryan Gentry,
00:29:16 who I'll say his fucking name.
00:29:18 I don't care because we all hated him anyways.
00:29:20 We kicked him out of the group
00:29:21 shortly after this.
00:29:22 But we were driving.
00:29:25 We were in the drive.
00:29:26 We were about to pull out.
00:29:27 And I like wasn't in the car yet.
00:29:29 And I was like getting my seatbelt on.
00:29:32 And he like fucking zoomed out.
00:29:34 And I'm like, slow down.
00:29:35 I'm not in the car.
00:29:36 I'm out the door.
00:29:37 And I was like, hey, not the door.
00:29:38 And I like got wrapped up in my seatbelt.
00:29:40 And I couldn't.
00:29:41 Oh, no.
00:29:42 I couldn't move myself.
00:29:43 So like, I just like plummeted out of the car.
00:29:45 And like, he kept going.
00:29:48 And like, he didn't have to keep going.
00:29:50 He wasn't going that fast.
00:29:52 He could have stopped.
00:29:53 He knew I was down there.
00:29:54 But he just kept going.
00:29:56 And he ran right over like right up and over my fucking
00:30:00 my ankle.
00:30:01 And I was like tied up in a seat belt.
00:30:03 And you ran over my leg.
00:30:04 And I'm like, well, you're not my friend anymore.
00:30:07 What happened to your leg?
00:30:09 It just hurt a bit.
00:30:11 I mean, I did.
00:30:12 Did you break anything?
00:30:13 I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything.
00:30:15 But he's still though.
00:30:17 It was a Jeep Wrangler and not a fucking.
00:30:20 I don't know.
00:30:21 It wasn't a Jeep Wrangler.
00:30:22 You invented that part of the story.
00:30:24 I know.
00:30:25 I like that better.
00:30:26 That's the story now.
00:30:27 That's the story now.
00:30:29 A Jeep Wrangler showed me mercy.
00:30:31 And now I'm indebted.
00:30:34 Jesse told me the story about how Colt Corona ran over
00:30:37 with a Jeep Wrangler.
00:30:42 Colt Corona tried to save him.
00:30:44 It was actually the K-Fib commander driving the dreaded
00:30:49 mobile on a mission to hurt me.
00:30:52 I like to think that it's your friend has his face
00:30:55 and as he was driving this thing, he pulls off the face mask
00:30:58 and underneath is that sheer metal plate
00:31:00 of the K-Fib commander under the face.
00:31:02 He's wearing the mask under his human face.
00:31:04 Give a man a mask and he'll show you his true face,
00:31:07 Oscar Wilde, K-Fib commander.
00:31:10 AKA the K-Fib commander.
00:31:15 As he left me there in the ditch
00:31:17 with my broken shattered ankle
00:31:20 and zoomed off into the night, I could hear him laughing.
00:31:23 Mustard on my burger.
00:31:28 That phrase has haunted you as nightmares ever since.
00:31:32 Fantastic.
00:31:34 Well, I've got one that isn't as dramatic as that,
00:31:37 but it was a very trippy experience.
00:31:40 So I was kind of tripping.
00:31:43 So there's not much to it.
00:31:45 Not a full-over trip.
00:31:46 No, I did not trip or fall off a cliff in this case.
00:31:49 Well, I mean, a quick one was I went skydiving once
00:31:52 and there was nothing crazy about it.
00:31:54 I didn't think I was going to die intellectually,
00:31:57 but the experience was very much of dying inside
00:32:00 and being reborn as the hero of mankind
00:32:02 that I knew it would become one day.
00:32:04 So I'd highly recommend everyone go skydiving.
00:32:06 It was super fun.
00:32:07 But the other time was, so I just had a fever.
00:32:12 Nothing crazy was going on.
00:32:14 I just had a fever one time when I was in fourth grade.
00:32:17 But what was interesting were the side effects of this fever.
00:32:20 Later on, I would find out that I had a temperature at the time
00:32:24 and I went to the hospital at some point.
00:32:26 My brain temperature was around, or my body temperature was 165.
00:32:30 168.5, I want to say.
00:32:33 Yeah, something like that.
00:32:35 Are you sure it's not 106?
00:32:37 It was really hot.
00:32:38 Not 106?
00:32:39 Sorry, I think that was it.
00:32:40 165.
00:32:41 Well, I don't remember the exact number there.
00:32:43 I remember it being 106.
00:32:46 I thought it was like 126.1.
00:32:48 Okay, whatever's the reasonable number there,
00:32:50 whatever's the reasonable one, that's what it was.
00:32:52 But it was like 6.5 at the end.
00:32:53 Like standard human is like 98.
00:32:56 Yes, okay.
00:32:57 All right, I think you're right.
00:32:58 I think you're right here.
00:32:59 And the thing is brain death begins to occur at 106.8.
00:33:04 So I was 0.3 away from starting to die.
00:33:07 So it was pretty close.
00:33:09 But nothing bad happened to me that I know.
00:33:11 I remember.
00:33:12 After this point, I started to like animate.
00:33:14 It was kind of a weird, you know, I don't know what was going on there.
00:33:17 I remember that day because I, again, because of our dad,
00:33:22 basically told me you were going to die.
00:33:25 Oh my God, what the fuck, dude?
00:33:27 And I was terrified all day at school.
00:33:30 Understandably.
00:33:32 Yeah, because like dad basically said,
00:33:34 like Nate might die.
00:33:35 And I was like, oh God, what the fuck?
00:33:38 Dad, this is not optimal for my studies.
00:33:40 Just don't tell me until he's actually dead.
00:33:42 It really wasn't optimal for my fucking studies.
00:33:45 Didn't do me any goddamn favors.
00:33:48 So what I remember about that day was that,
00:33:51 so at this time, I think I was in like, I don't know,
00:33:54 like first grade I was like really young or something.
00:33:56 And I was really into the Power Rangers.
00:33:58 And the Power Rangers like second movie had come out
00:34:03 and it's the one with like Lord Ooze.
00:34:05 Ivan Ooze.
00:34:06 And they got all the Ivan Ooze.
00:34:08 Yeah, yeah.
00:34:09 All right, all right, my mistake.
00:34:10 The CG in that movie is fucking amazing.
00:34:13 Really?
00:34:14 Yeah.
00:34:15 I have to go watch it again.
00:34:16 And I mean in like the worst way possible.
00:34:18 The CG of like the new zords coming together
00:34:22 to form the new Megazord is the most embarrassing thing.
00:34:27 Like it is so bad.
00:34:29 It's incredible.
00:34:30 That's fantastic.
00:34:31 Fuck you.
00:34:32 Yeah, I want to watch, I'll have to watch it again
00:34:34 because it really left an impression on me due to this story.
00:34:37 So like the point is that like this guy Ivan Ooze
00:34:42 was like he became like the main character of my brain
00:34:45 during this day that I was having this bizarre fever dream.
00:34:49 So like, oh, it was weird.
00:34:51 Like I obtained Ooze powers and got my own,
00:34:54 I got my own Megazord.
00:34:56 But the way these worked was you had to turn it to Ooze
00:34:58 and kind of merge into your Megazord,
00:35:00 sort of like a year merging with the brain
00:35:02 of the person they're possessing in Animorphs,
00:35:04 which I was also into at the time.
00:35:06 What the fuck are you talking about?
00:35:08 I'm talking about my experience of what was happening
00:35:10 during this day where I was almost brain dead.
00:35:12 So this was like a fever dream you were having?
00:35:14 This was a fever dream, yeah.
00:35:16 I see, okay.
00:35:17 I mean, just what was interesting about it
00:35:19 was how like everyone in this fever dream
00:35:22 was like an Ooze man like me
00:35:24 and I formed a whole Ooze civilization of people
00:35:26 and we all had Megazords.
00:35:28 And Ivan Ooze was our king, I believe.
00:35:31 It was nuts.
00:35:33 I experienced being an Ooze man
00:35:35 for a while for that day
00:35:37 and I'd highly recommend it to anyone
00:35:39 who has the opportunity to give it a try.
00:35:41 Being an Ooze man?
00:35:43 Is this a fever dream?
00:35:45 I don't know whether I've had an actual fever dream before.
00:35:48 Is it different from a dream in that you remember it better?
00:35:51 Well, what was different was that I was...
00:35:53 It's just a really crazy dream that comes about
00:35:55 and it was kind of like I was conscious at the time.
00:35:58 So I was conscious of what was going on around me
00:36:01 but it was just really like distorted
00:36:04 and I wasn't like processing information properly.
00:36:06 It was really weird. It was really weird.
00:36:08 I don't know, that's basically it though.
00:36:10 Like Ivan Ooze, I will never forget.
00:36:12 And I wish I could like paint the picture
00:36:14 because I have some very specific imagery
00:36:16 that occurred to me on that day
00:36:18 that I have never forgotten since
00:36:19 and I don't think I ever will forget.
00:36:21 Like there's this one of Ivan Ooze's face
00:36:23 like stretching off the rest of his body
00:36:25 just like towards me and kind of curling around
00:36:27 into this like bizarre, disgusting face.
00:36:30 It stuck with me for like 20 years now
00:36:32 so I don't think it's going anywhere.
00:36:34 It's going to be with me till my dying day.
00:36:36 Well, whatever, yeah.
00:36:38 I'm just saying it was a crazy trippy time.
00:36:40 That's all I'm saying. Really the story isn't that interesting.
00:36:42 I had a crazy dream. That's what happened.
00:36:44 You know, I'll tell you one time,
00:36:46 speaking of...
00:36:48 I mean I assume you were speaking of something, I don't remember.
00:36:50 But I'll tell you some time.
00:36:52 One time.
00:36:54 I died a time.
00:36:56 I'll tell you guys about the time I had appendicitis
00:36:59 when I was in high school
00:37:01 and nobody believed
00:37:03 that I had appendicitis.
00:37:05 Nobody would take me to the hospital.
00:37:07 Oh, Jesse,
00:37:09 with your crazy schemes
00:37:11 with your wildest audience appendicitis.
00:37:13 Oh, come on.
00:37:15 Don't pull my leg.
00:37:17 To make it to the top, but he's kind of in the middle
00:37:19 because he's always getting caught.
00:37:21 God damn it, Jesse.
00:37:23 That's me. So I was laying there,
00:37:25 you know, I was like saying to like my mom
00:37:27 and my grandma, like everyone who was there,
00:37:29 you know, my stomach really hurts.
00:37:31 I think I'm really sick. I think I need to go to the hospital.
00:37:33 My mom at a certain point
00:37:35 just like left the state and like went to
00:37:37 North Carolina during this week
00:37:39 and said, you'll be fine.
00:37:41 So like no one was there to take me anywhere.
00:37:43 Everyone who came in the house
00:37:45 said that I was just, you know, a big fat faker
00:37:47 trying to skip school or whatever.
00:37:49 So I'm laying there.
00:37:51 My fucking, my cousin comes in one day.
00:37:53 My cousin who's this
00:37:55 a woman of
00:37:57 sizeable size
00:37:59 right, a big fat slut.
00:38:01 She's a big fat slut, yeah.
00:38:03 Yeah.
00:38:05 You know, she's like a
00:38:07 like a 250, like a
00:38:09 300 pound lady.
00:38:11 She comes in, she comes in
00:38:13 and she goes, I'm laying on the couch. She goes, oh, you're not sick
00:38:15 and she fucking sits on me.
00:38:17 She sits on my abdomen
00:38:19 where my appendix lives
00:38:21 just like squishing it,
00:38:23 killing me.
00:38:25 So finally, on like
00:38:27 the fourth day,
00:38:29 my uncle Tony came
00:38:31 and he was the only one who believed me
00:38:33 because he's the only one who ever believes me.
00:38:35 So he took me to the hospital
00:38:37 and the doctor just said, yeah
00:38:39 you're like a day away from dying.
00:38:41 Your appendix is going to burst.
00:38:43 We have to put you in surgery right now.
00:38:45 So they put me in surgery
00:38:47 and then I woke up and
00:38:49 they took it out of me
00:38:51 to like a party and I
00:38:53 like
00:38:55 I just like showed up at the party like all my friends were there
00:38:57 and I'm like, hey guys, guess who
00:38:59 just had a surgery and I like looked at my
00:39:01 shirt and I had a little scar and they were like, yeah
00:39:03 you're cool. We're all going to suck your dick.
00:39:05 Oh, the girl said that and they
00:39:07 did and that's how I got well
00:39:09 laid for 100 years. I had sex
00:39:11 with every woman I ever met
00:39:13 and that's the moral of the story.
00:39:15 What a great story.
00:39:17 I love a story with a happy ending.
00:39:19 And Colt Corona was there too
00:39:21 and he even got laid.
00:39:23 Yeah, imagine that.
00:39:25 And you guys hear each other high fives.
00:39:27 Yeah, the K-Fabe Commander
00:39:29 on an Eiffel Tower. The K-Fabe Commander
00:39:31 thought he could poison my appendix to put me down
00:39:33 for the count but it is planned backfired
00:39:35 and it got me and horse boy laid
00:39:37 a thousand times. All these stories
00:39:39 just K-Fabe Commander
00:39:41 and Colt Corona.
00:39:43 I was at the party
00:39:45 having my big fun orgy
00:39:47 with all my friends and K-Fabe Commander
00:39:49 was like watching over it from
00:39:51 he was overlooking it from like a cliff side
00:39:53 going curse you. You've eluded my
00:39:55 vengeance again.
00:39:57 And I was
00:39:59 I was yelling back at him. Fuck you.
00:40:01 Who's that guy in the
00:40:03 WWE? He's like the, he's not the goat guy
00:40:05 but he like thinks that he can take over the world
00:40:07 by like winning the WWE championship. Which guy is that?
00:40:09 Oh, Bray Wyatt. The crazy guy.
00:40:11 Yeah, I was thinking like
00:40:13 instead of, it's like that. The K-Fabe
00:40:15 Commander is like him only it's reversed
00:40:17 where he thinks by like pulling these evil schemes
00:40:19 to like defeat you that will get him
00:40:21 the championship belt. He'll become a wrestling champion.
00:40:23 Yeah, that's his plan. He defeats you.
00:40:25 He becomes champion. Right.
00:40:27 That's his master plan.
00:40:29 He's completely detest from reality.
00:40:31 He doesn't understand anything. He's an idiot.
00:40:33 He's a madman.
00:40:35 He doesn't even know the rules of wrestling.
00:40:37 He's an idiot but it only increases
00:40:39 his evil retard strength.
00:40:41 That's right.
00:40:43 He gets, the stronger he gets.
00:40:45 I'm like
00:40:47 Corona who gets weaker
00:40:49 the more he
00:40:51 the more love fills
00:40:53 Corona's heart the weaker he gets.
00:40:55 He's constantly getting weaker.
00:40:57 Aw.
00:40:59 Isn't that nice? He lives a charmed week life.
00:41:01 So, Tom
00:41:03 you're a man on Death's Door
00:41:05 every day so
00:41:07 what's your story buddy? I am he says matter of fact.
00:41:09 I was going to say
00:41:11 I'm dying inside right now
00:41:13 because I'm at work
00:41:15 Right. Fair.
00:41:19 Oh my god, that sucks.
00:41:27 Okay, we'll come back. We'll be here.
00:41:29 Fair point.
00:41:31 Okay, we'll come back. We'll come back.
00:41:33 We should have had him tell some stories
00:41:35 when he was actually available.
00:41:37 We really fucked up.
00:41:41 That's true.
00:41:43 That's true.
00:41:45 That is true.
00:41:47 You, you audience
00:41:49 you really screwed the pooch on this one.
00:41:51 At TP Crasinators
00:41:53 send us good questions
00:41:55 that we can answer.
00:41:57 Okay, so why don't I give, you were going to say something.
00:41:59 Let's talk about dying inside in the meantime, right?
00:42:01 Oh yeah, dying inside, well
00:42:03 I mean obviously depression
00:42:05 and all that sad stuff that happens
00:42:07 all over the time, all over the place every day
00:42:09 but I can think of
00:42:11 a very specific moment
00:42:13 where I was at my lowest point ever
00:42:15 and it was before I was a
00:42:17 YouTuber.
00:42:19 I had left school
00:42:21 because it was ended
00:42:23 and then I was like, okay, what do I do?
00:42:25 I want to maybe go to university
00:42:27 but I don't know what I want to do at university
00:42:29 I don't know what I want to do in my life
00:42:31 and so I took a year off
00:42:33 before I
00:42:35 made a decision. Everyone else in my class
00:42:37 had made their decision and was going away
00:42:39 and getting the funny hats
00:42:41 and getting kids and all that
00:42:43 shit and I was like, okay
00:42:45 I'm not sure about doing animation
00:42:47 it seems scary
00:42:49 so I was
00:42:51 all sad and stuff and my parents were like
00:42:53 well, if you're not going to
00:42:55 go to university, you should
00:42:57 get a job or go on the dole
00:42:59 which is the benefits thing
00:43:01 for working
00:43:03 for looking for a job
00:43:05 and so I went
00:43:07 to the thing
00:43:09 and it was really depressing because
00:43:11 they really
00:43:13 it's like a corporate
00:43:15 building with people who hate their job
00:43:17 sitting in a stuffy sort of building
00:43:19 and I have to go in and
00:43:21 stamp the thing and files
00:43:23 and paperwork and all that
00:43:25 they had recently changed the law
00:43:27 when I got this
00:43:29 so usually you would go in
00:43:31 I'm looking for work and then you would write down
00:43:33 a bunch of things, say, proving
00:43:35 links to websites that you were looking for
00:43:37 work, obviously
00:43:39 nobody had any proof, they just said they did
00:43:41 and that's how they got money
00:43:43 but they changed the law
00:43:45 I did that
00:43:47 on unemployment benefits
00:43:49 at one point I got laid off
00:43:51 from a job and I had to pretend
00:43:53 I was looking for real work while I continued
00:43:55 while I got unemployment insurance from that
00:43:57 it was great
00:43:59 it would have been great for me too
00:44:01 except for this law change where it said
00:44:03 while you're looking for work
00:44:05 in addition
00:44:07 to proving that you're looking for work
00:44:09 you have to do a certain amount of hours
00:44:11 of volunteer work
00:44:13 at charity shops
00:44:15 Jesus
00:44:17 so I would have to get up
00:44:19 really early and get on the bus
00:44:21 to this
00:44:23 quite far away place
00:44:25 across the river, I don't know where it was
00:44:27 in the part of time that I didn't understand
00:44:29 or knew
00:44:31 and I think it was because I made a mistake
00:44:33 on the paperwork
00:44:35 they just sent me far away so I had to get up at
00:44:37 like six every morning
00:44:39 like three or four times a week
00:44:41 probably three times a week
00:44:43 to this charity shop
00:44:45 and the people in there were really
00:44:47 no nonsense
00:44:49 nobody liked me, nobody would give me
00:44:51 any sort of
00:44:53 let me get away with anything
00:44:55 you have to work for this amount of time
00:44:57 the first day I got there
00:44:59 it was closed because the owner of the shop
00:45:01 didn't turn up because she was sick
00:45:03 and I didn't get any
00:45:05 hours
00:45:07 for that day because she wasn't there
00:45:09 so I had to go for an extra day and work overtime
00:45:11 and I was doing this for like
00:45:13 two weeks before I decided
00:45:15 that I would rather just walk the streets
00:45:17 and die
00:45:19 and it was this one time
00:45:21 where I was on the bus
00:45:23 you know
00:45:25 even my music in my headphones
00:45:27 just sort of like
00:45:29 and this lady
00:45:31 at the front of the bus
00:45:33 she for some reason
00:45:35 at some point and I didn't notice
00:45:37 because I didn't hear because I had my headphones in
00:45:39 she said alright everyone off
00:45:41 this is going not in service bus
00:45:43 at the moment and I was right at the back
00:45:45 and everyone else got off
00:45:47 and they looked at me and I looked at them
00:45:49 and they thought why aren't you getting off
00:45:51 but they didn't say anything so I was just like
00:45:53 everyone wants to get off at this stop
00:45:55 and then it kept going for a bit
00:45:57 and I realized wait
00:45:59 she's
00:46:01 not stopping at any of these bus stops
00:46:03 she doesn't know that I'm here, what do I do
00:46:05 and then
00:46:07 at one point she glanced behind
00:46:09 she saw that I was at the back of the bus and she said
00:46:11 what the fuck you doing there
00:46:13 she was like one of those you know
00:46:15 real chevy, real sweary, angry
00:46:17 bitches
00:46:19 she said get the fuck off the bus
00:46:21 you can't you just
00:46:23 I told you to get off
00:46:25 I told you to get off I'm like I didn't hear
00:46:27 why is she so mean
00:46:29 because she works in a bus
00:46:31 that's fair
00:46:33 wait
00:46:35 why were you still on the bus past your stop
00:46:37 he didn't hear dog he didn't hear the NS
00:46:39 I didn't hear that the bus had gone
00:46:41 out of service and she was driving to the bus
00:46:43 station to put it away
00:46:45 so did she just drop you off like in the middle of nowhere
00:46:47 yeah she dropped me off in the middle of nowhere
00:46:49 I didn't know where I was
00:46:51 I didn't know how many stops I had to go
00:46:53 and I was like you know what
00:46:55 fuck this and I just started walking
00:46:57 in the direction I assumed was home
00:46:59 I went into a library
00:47:01 I thought I could just stay here all day and then
00:47:03 you know the police would get me
00:47:05 something they'd file a missing persons report
00:47:07 yeah
00:47:09 but I decided I was
00:47:11 going to go on an adventure this was like
00:47:13 this is the coolest thing that happened in the
00:47:15 worst time possible
00:47:17 I was so depressed of life
00:47:19 I thought let's just walk and see if I can
00:47:21 find my way home
00:47:23 up to this point was this the time
00:47:25 lowest of your life when you wanted to die
00:47:27 when you were dumped off this bus
00:47:29 yeah it was like
00:47:31 I thought that's what you were building too
00:47:33 it was the lowest point in my life
00:47:35 but it was the moment that I snapped
00:47:37 and said you know what
00:47:39 fuck going to this stupid thing
00:47:41 I am just going to walk
00:47:43 aimlessly until I can see a bus stop
00:47:45 or a bus you know a bus number
00:47:47 that I recognize I can get on that
00:47:49 and I can eventually find my way home
00:47:51 and it took like six hours
00:47:53 and I finally got home and I was like okay
00:47:55 time to play
00:47:57 video games I guess
00:47:59 and then soon after that
00:48:01 I you know
00:48:03 applied for university college
00:48:05 whatever stuff and I got on
00:48:07 and all that and it was
00:48:09 just a really cool moment where I decided
00:48:11 to go on an adventure and I enjoyed it
00:48:13 because of everything being
00:48:15 terrible
00:48:17 I think we could all do with a little more adventurous moments
00:48:19 like that in our lives
00:48:21 I condone such things
00:48:23 yeah
00:48:25 and then I made a youtube channel
00:48:29 and it was up on up
00:48:31 that was a mistake
00:48:35 alright cool
00:48:37 so it sounds like that actually
00:48:39 got a little bit better at the end
00:48:41 of it so that's
00:48:43 I wanted to end on a higher note because I don't want this
00:48:45 this is like a really dour topic
00:48:47 like oh did you almost die you're dead
00:48:49 and sadness and oh
00:48:51 nobody believed that I was going to
00:48:53 kill myself
00:48:55 it's not a nice topic
00:48:57 you know it's a really depressing thing
00:48:59 I know this has been spoken at various times
00:49:01 but like you know when you're really upset
00:49:03 I did just talk about this a couple times
00:49:05 but like no one around knows
00:49:07 and you're just sitting there
00:49:09 just want the world to burn
00:49:11 and everyone else is acting like there's nothing wrong
00:49:13 oh that's my least favorite position
00:49:15 to be because you can't even say anything
00:49:17 you know you don't want to ruin everyone else's life
00:49:19 with your shit
00:49:21 it's also when you don't realize that you're not
00:49:23 looking sad enough
00:49:25 because you do
00:49:27 and nobody pays attention
00:49:29 you have that moment in your childhood
00:49:31 where you realize
00:49:33 or childhood or teenage life where you're depressed
00:49:35 and you realize that
00:49:37 nobody's going
00:49:39 nobody's looking out for you at the moment
00:49:41 or at any point you just have to make sure
00:49:43 you tell people things
00:49:45 it's sort of like a transition
00:49:47 sort of like you know
00:49:49 your kid your parents are always looking out for you asking you
00:49:51 if you're okay
00:49:53 and if nobody asks you if you're okay you can't say
00:49:55 I'm not okay
00:49:57 and it's like you got to get over that
00:49:59 that moment
00:50:01 and you become a real boy
00:50:03 one day I'll figure it out
00:50:05 one day I'll be a real boy
00:50:07 but until that day
00:50:09 I'll just be the best guy ever
00:50:11 until that day
00:50:13 like, share, subscribe, comment

00:50:23 this cult has got
00:50:25 to heaven
00:50:27 oh my god do you think I would
00:50:29 get more money if I just made a patreon
00:50:31 cultcorona
00:50:33 he's the only one we love anymore
00:50:35 watch it eclipse all of our patrons in one day
00:50:37 I think cultcorona is the only
00:50:39 member of the PCP that is unanimously
00:50:41 like universally
00:50:43 by everyone
00:50:45 for sure, agreed, totally agreed
00:50:47 I mean people would
00:50:49 all like action giraffe but he's just too successful
00:50:51 and it really rubbed some people the wrong way
00:50:53 everybody
00:50:55 everybody hates Jess but they love
00:50:57 cultcorona they have no idea
00:50:59 I taught that horse boy everything
00:51:01 he fucking knows
00:51:03 I don't believe it
00:51:05 he's got a pure soul that you could never touch
00:51:07 jesse you couldn't
00:51:09 you can't teach that
00:51:11 I gave him that soul I imbued it
00:51:13 within him after stealing it from
00:51:15 a thousand babies
00:51:17 you breathe life into him
00:51:19 with a kiss
00:51:21 I went to fucking china and I took
00:51:23 all the dead female baby
00:51:25 souls out of maiden astrea's
00:51:27 swamp pit and I put them into
00:51:29 that horsey body
00:51:31 that horsey baby boy
00:51:33 and I created the perfect
00:51:35 person
00:51:37 the perfect person
00:51:39 the cutest and the strongest
00:51:41 the perfect person cultcorona
00:51:43 with the soul of a thousand
00:51:45 innocent newborn chinese female
00:51:47 babies
00:51:51 not tainted by the patriarchy one
00:51:53 iota, thank god
00:51:55 there's no patriarchy in the
00:51:57 furnace room ladies
00:51:59 everybody come on in
00:52:01 it's a safe space for women
00:52:03 everywhere
00:52:05 women and horse boys
00:52:07 so who else is
00:52:09 a time I forget even what this
00:52:11 fucking subject was like when they wanted to die
00:52:13 was that what it was?
00:52:15 it sort of merged into that
00:52:17 it was times we almost died but there's
00:52:19 only so many moments that you can even say
00:52:21 I was sick once
00:52:23 I mean I don't know if it's like
00:52:25 technically almost dying but I do feel
00:52:27 like living in this room
00:52:29 for six years has dramatically
00:52:31 decreased my life span
00:52:33 quite possible
00:52:35 I feel like I'm generally ten thousand times
00:52:37 less healthy than I was before I moved here
00:52:39 you gotta run away
00:52:41 you gotta escape
00:52:43 I gotta get all my stuff in like a stick
00:52:45 with a little like a
00:52:47 a bindle on a stick
00:52:49 cause you got so many comics
00:52:51 and games
00:52:53 and most of the only things you have
00:52:55 no food
00:52:57 no black dust
00:52:59 just a raft made out of long boxes filled with
00:53:01 comics and I'll sail the seas
00:53:03 on them
00:53:05 as all the comics get wet and ruined
00:53:07 sailing the seas
00:53:09 of the man child marsh
00:53:11 so
00:53:13 I had a time
00:53:15 that I wanted to die just for fun I thought
00:53:17 I'd bring this up just for fun
00:53:19 I thought so there was a time
00:53:21 when
00:53:23 I've said before there was a time when I was
00:53:25 really into the pickup scene
00:53:27 and at one point I made
00:53:29 a critical error
00:53:31 I would go out with my friends sometimes
00:53:33 in Providence
00:53:35 and on this particular occasion
00:53:37 I made the crucial mistake
00:53:39 of telling my friend Doug
00:53:41 that my plan for the day was to
00:53:43 talk to X number of girls
00:53:45 just for my own personal checklist
00:53:47 to get better at it
00:53:49 what Doug did
00:53:51 Doug you fucking traitor
00:53:53 I've never addressed this to him because I'm too embarrassed
00:53:55 but he then went around
00:53:57 telling everyone
00:53:59 hey that guy's got a goal of like
00:54:01 he's trying to talk to a bunch of girls
00:54:03 every girl go talk to him
00:54:05 what are you doing over here
00:54:07 that's fucking helpful
00:54:09 he ruined it
00:54:11 thank god I'm so charismatic
00:54:13 I was able to spin it into a positive
00:54:15 but he should know nonetheless
00:54:17 he eats me up it was the worst thing Doug
00:54:19 has ever done to me in his life
00:54:21 and one day I'll work up the courage to tell
00:54:23 him that that's the case
00:54:25 you can't trust friends man
00:54:27 not with stuff like that
00:54:29 anyway not with stuff like that
00:54:31 so that was probably
00:54:33 the time I was most embarrassed
00:54:35 in my life I think
00:54:37 and would have happily accepted death
00:54:39 yeah
00:54:41 indeed
00:54:43 so
00:54:45 if anybody else doesn't have anything
00:54:47 we can just go to questions before Tom comes back
00:54:49 I got one
00:54:51 there's one time in TF2 where I got headshot
00:54:53 and then Pyro got me with
00:54:55 the fire and I was on fire I was like oh no
00:54:57 I'm gonna die
00:54:59 and then
00:55:01 there's a thing where a scout sometimes
00:55:03 uses a weapon and if he kills a guy
00:55:05 he drops a health pack and he did that in front of me
00:55:07 and I got a health and I live
00:55:09 I almost died
00:55:11 there was this one time
00:55:13 in League of Legends
00:55:15 I don't know who I was playing but I went down to 1 HP
00:55:17 in this big team fight but I didn't die
00:55:19 it was epic
00:55:21 god I fucking hate video games
00:55:23 if you die in the game
00:55:25 you don't die for real
00:55:27 I think that if you die in the game
00:55:29 you should die for real because then
00:55:31 fucking people who play video games will all die
00:55:33 because video games are gay
00:55:35 and they're not art
00:55:37 and they're standing in a crime
00:55:39 what if you read a book and a character dies
00:55:41 absolutely
00:55:43 you definitely should die
00:55:45 let me tell you
00:55:47 let me go on a totally unrelated tangent
00:55:49 that has nothing to do with anything
00:55:51 because I have the power to do that
00:55:53 and I'm gonna abuse it
00:55:55 there's a scene
00:55:57 it's a French movie called
00:55:59 The Rabbi's Cat
00:56:01 and it's animated and it's great
00:56:03 but there's like
00:56:05 a Russian guy
00:56:07 it takes place in Algiers
00:56:09 it's a Muslim city but with a big Jewish population
00:56:11 it's kind of Middle Eastern
00:56:13 isn't that where from Camus is from
00:56:15 who the fuck is clopping
00:56:17 I think Tom is walking around
00:56:19 stop it
00:56:21 you damned innocent boy
00:56:23 you don't know what sin you're committing
00:56:25 okay well anyway
00:56:27 so the main character is this Rabbi
00:56:29 and there's this Russian
00:56:31 adventurer guy
00:56:33 and he's there in the city
00:56:35 on some shitty quest
00:56:37 and they're talking with
00:56:39 his Rabbi teacher
00:56:41 and this kind of like fucking
00:56:43 sort of like Libertine Russian guy
00:56:45 and the Russian guy is like ah you
00:56:47 old man in your religion
00:56:49 I care about, I don't care about
00:56:51 God or any of that bullshit
00:56:53 all I care about is like
00:56:55 all I care about is like
00:56:57 adventure, women
00:56:59 and literature
00:57:01 yeah
00:57:03 and the Rabbi is like
00:57:05 man those are all things for young men
00:57:07 and I was like oh my god
00:57:09 even literature
00:57:11 especially literature
00:57:13 he threw, he basically
00:57:15 I mean if literature is for young men
00:57:17 then all art is for young men
00:57:19 as far as I'm concerned the guy completely
00:57:21 threw all artistic endeavor under the
00:57:23 fucking bus and you know what
00:57:25 I was like oh my god maybe he's right
00:57:27 in fact to this day
00:57:29 to this day I'm not convinced that he wasn't right
00:57:31 that literature and by extension
00:57:33 all art is just kid shit and we're all
00:57:35 just fucking fooling ourselves
00:57:37 that's fascinating
00:57:39 while you're young and you have the information
00:57:41 and now you don't need anymore because you've got all of it
00:57:43 who was this guy?
00:57:45 I didn't listen to the first half of the story
00:57:47 but now I'm intrigued
00:57:49 it was a character in a movie called the Rabbi's Cad
00:57:51 you know what
00:57:53 and he was like this fast living
00:57:55 kind of like nasty
00:57:57 amoral Libertine Russian dude
00:57:59 well I can see
00:58:01 his point that art is all worthless
00:58:03 oh no no it was the Rabbi
00:58:05 the Rabbi said that art is for
00:58:07 young men
00:58:09 I think I kind of agree with that
00:58:11 I agree
00:58:13 I was compelled
00:58:15 from that guy's perspective
00:58:17 I think this is where he's coming from
00:58:19 he's concerned about his community
00:58:21 and the people he knows in his life
00:58:23 and his relationship with God
00:58:25 is what's important to him
00:58:27 right so from that perspective
00:58:29 I totally get it
00:58:31 I'm very utilitarian
00:58:33 about my
00:58:35 usage of art
00:58:37 I think that art that doesn't
00:58:39 do anything useful is basically garbage
00:58:41 but if there's art with a good message
00:58:43 or is trying to convey something valuable
00:58:45 to the people intellectually
00:58:47 I see a value in it there
00:58:49 but it's just like a tool
00:58:51 like anything else for
00:58:53 the betterment of humanity
00:58:55 I don't even think God could do that
00:58:57 I think just maybe
00:58:59 doing things with your community
00:59:01 or talking to people
00:59:03 hey I'm a cool Rabbi in my neighborhood
00:59:05 what's up peeps
00:59:07 that might just be a better way to spend your time
00:59:09 I don't know
00:59:11 this guy doesn't see any practical value in art
00:59:13 and you know what he's fucking right
00:59:15 man this is a big left turn
00:59:17 this is a big left turn of a topic
00:59:19 but I really like it it's real cool
00:59:21 I don't know he's right
00:59:23 I think we can all agree art has no value
00:59:25 utilitarian value I suppose
00:59:27 you know what value
00:59:29 is there besides utilitarian?
00:59:31 well all value
00:59:33 well I'll tell you
00:59:35 there's no such thing as inherent value
00:59:37 I've never
00:59:39 I've never regretted
00:59:41 a moment spent with friends
00:59:43 or loved ones
00:59:45 whereas I have regretted
00:59:47 everything artistic I've ever done in my life
00:59:49 and everything that's come from it
00:59:51 in spite of everything I just said
00:59:53 I have never regretted
00:59:55 any time that I spent making anything
00:59:57 but I regret so much of the time
00:59:59 I spent hanging out with friends
01:00:01 making is different from consuming
01:00:03 I feel a little bit like Ben
01:00:05 I don't really
01:00:07 there's only a few people I enjoy hanging out with
01:00:09 in real life
01:00:11 and even those people it's not like I want to do it all the time
01:00:13 yeah no
01:00:15 totally
01:00:17 but that's the thing there's a balance to be found
01:00:19 I think
01:00:21 I think it's like
01:00:23 you need
01:00:25 you know
01:00:27 on a more base level
01:00:29 you need human companionship
01:00:31 more than you need to be entertained
01:00:33 because like entertainment
01:00:35 as it is
01:00:37 art as entertainment is just
01:00:39 to make you
01:00:41 escape from reality
01:00:43 because reality is kind of shit
01:00:45 if you have everything
01:00:47 you have food
01:00:49 you have shelter you have family
01:00:51 and friends
01:00:53 you don't really need anything else
01:00:55 but if you have all that
01:00:57 then I think art is a nice little distraction
01:00:59 nice little addition
01:01:01 cherry on top
01:01:03 and to your first point
01:01:05 how much of the art that we consume
01:01:07 especially like anime and stuff
01:01:09 how much of that is just made to simulate human relationships
01:01:11 to take the place of the hole in our lives
01:01:13 that art is just there
01:01:15 a ton
01:01:17 I'm seeing
01:01:19 I'm converting to Judaism as we speak
01:01:21 like when people
01:01:23 I don't know
01:01:25 like if two people
01:01:27 two people are fans of Harry Potter
01:01:29 two people love Harry Potter
01:01:31 what that means is that the two of them
01:01:33 have fucking shared
01:01:35 this simulated experience
01:01:37 of like fucking being
01:01:39 a wizard
01:01:41 and that's what it is
01:01:43 what Harry Potter fucking does
01:01:45 simulate for anyone who reads it
01:01:47 the experience
01:01:49 of being a wizard child
01:01:51 and like
01:01:53 I don't know where I'm fucking going with this
01:01:55 I've got a point to go with that
01:01:57 it's weird and bizarre for me to think of it that way
01:01:59 but it makes sense to think of art is just
01:02:01 all art is just a simulation
01:02:03 it's basically no different
01:02:05 than just putting on a VR headset
01:02:07 it accomplishes the same fucking thing
01:02:09 right and in that way
01:02:11 you might ask the question
01:02:13 why not just with that person
01:02:15 just go have an experience
01:02:17 and then like bam
01:02:19 you've just increased your human connection
01:02:21 but there is a difference there
01:02:23 well hang on
01:02:25 one answer to that is that art can give you experiences
01:02:27 that you can't actually have in real life
01:02:29 that's what I was going to say
01:02:31 and that's fair but
01:02:33 are those experiences more valuable
01:02:35 than ones that you actually can have in real life
01:02:37 that's exactly where I was going to go to
01:02:39 because like everything you experience in that way
01:02:41 is like there are things that you normally wouldn't get in life
01:02:43 and you know what
01:02:45 to some extent I think they could be useful
01:02:47 because what an average human
01:02:49 would experience in their life without VR
01:02:51 we cannot say for sure that it is necessarily
01:02:53 the most optimal way to live your life
01:02:55 in terms of pragmatically and enjoyment wise
01:02:57 so there may indeed be a place
01:02:59 for simulated experiences in real life
01:03:01 but we should find out what that is
01:03:03 we should find that out
01:03:05 I just want to say
01:03:07 the question for me then becomes
01:03:09 for sure art can give you experiences
01:03:11 that you can't have in real life
01:03:13 but is it valuable to have experiences
01:03:15 that are completely removed from reality
01:03:17 we need to find that out I don't know
01:03:19 I don't fucking know
01:03:21 I was going to talk about the fact that he didn't like literature
01:03:23 and it's like not all art
01:03:25 because literature is a story
01:03:27 I'm just going to say that I think
01:03:29 art in terms of like
01:03:31 a painting
01:03:33 it's not the same sort of thing
01:03:35 it's just something that makes you think
01:03:37 you need to look at just to experience
01:03:39 something to make the place
01:03:41 you live in feel more pretty
01:03:43 and decorative
01:03:45 art as like
01:03:47 as an expression
01:03:49 of emotion is sort of different
01:03:51 from art like literature and animation
01:03:53 and film and stuff like that
01:03:55 well you know I mean that's interesting
01:03:57 hang on I just want to say
01:03:59 I think he's got a good fucking point there
01:04:01 fair enough but I was going to say
01:04:03 that I was actually just doing a little bit of reading
01:04:05 I was watching some video I don't read anymore
01:04:07 there was some thing I was consuming
01:04:09 which was talking about
01:04:11 the history of art and it talked about how
01:04:13 like classical art work
01:04:15 specifically it was like paintings and like drawings
01:04:17 and stuff like that was depicted
01:04:19 things that we like understand
01:04:21 as real experiences that could be had
01:04:23 like as human beings like there was
01:04:25 photorealistic pictures of like
01:04:27 fruit which is you can appreciate the skill
01:04:29 with which they crafted it but really it's just
01:04:31 a picture of fruit at the end of the day
01:04:33 like the experience of fruit
01:04:35 hang on I'm making a point
01:04:37 and then there was like
01:04:39 there's also like depictions of great scenes
01:04:41 which capture like a snapshot of human life
01:04:43 but again that's basically like a real
01:04:45 thing or a story that we can understand
01:04:47 and it's not really making any grander
01:04:49 point other than illustrating perhaps the value
01:04:51 of that thing as a human experience
01:04:53 but like modern art and post-modern art
01:04:55 are taking that thing and
01:04:57 turning it on its head and they're exploring the ways
01:04:59 like if that's even a valuable thing
01:05:01 by doing things like like showing the
01:05:03 absurdity of putting like just
01:05:05 a drawing on a pedestal or putting like
01:05:07 you know something like a urinal which is like this famous piece
01:05:09 from the 30s making a urinal
01:05:11 with no special qualities saying
01:05:13 that that's art and having people like comment
01:05:15 on if that has any inherent value
01:05:17 by itself so it kind of raises the question
01:05:19 about if any of this is
01:05:21 valuable to begin with and like how far
01:05:23 does the stack of turtles go before we actually hit
01:05:25 like something that we're like
01:05:27 learning or like achieving through art
01:05:29 you know? You know what I mean?
01:05:31 I think if an art, if a piece of art
01:05:33 can help us to better
01:05:35 improve our social life
01:05:37 or you know
01:05:39 like the base level stuff
01:05:41 the social life and the
01:05:43 stability of your community
01:05:45 and art can help that
01:05:47 then I think it does have value in that way
01:05:49 Personally I really hate
01:05:51 I feel like art is useful in
01:05:53 just making people feel better
01:05:55 and being able to do things like that
01:05:57 Personally I really hate the idea
01:05:59 that like the purpose of art
01:06:01 and the value of art is some like
01:06:03 pragmatic like tangible benefit
01:06:05 that it has on other areas of what this is
01:06:07 What else could there be? What else could there be?
01:06:09 You're talking about like a pragmatic value
01:06:11 So there just is none?
01:06:13 I don't know, well yeah
01:06:15 Art can have social benefit
01:06:17 but like I don't fucking
01:06:19 think, I don't know
01:06:21 like if that's what art was
01:06:23 if the value of art was like
01:06:25 it makes people feel better
01:06:27 it makes people not kill themselves
01:06:29 it makes people's communities better
01:06:31 I would not do it
01:06:33 Kill yourselves fags
01:06:35 Kill yourselves
01:06:37 I was only like presenting that as like
01:06:39 a reason for art to be
01:06:41 cause like personally I think art is just like
01:06:43 if it's fun to make then you know
01:06:45 it's a fun pastime that's good
01:06:47 if it's fun to look at then yeah that's good
01:06:49 that's just nice, why wouldn't you make art
01:06:51 and have art
01:06:53 the act of creating art doesn't have to
01:06:55 necessarily be
01:06:57 what people get out of it like Ben you could make
01:06:59 something just cause like I feel like doing this
01:07:01 but people could get something more pragmatic
01:07:03 or like deep out of it that you've never intended
01:07:05 to do so it really
01:07:07 could really not like
01:07:09 your responsibility but I need to make this
01:07:11 but that's not why I do it
01:07:13 and you know I don't think that's good
01:07:15 personally for me that's not
01:07:17 good enough that's not enough justification
01:07:19 and I would say I do
01:07:21 like that idea but what I would do
01:07:23 is I would scientifically like
01:07:25 study what art form produces
01:07:27 the best tangible results and whatever that is
01:07:29 that's where I would focus like
01:07:31 artistic endeavor if I controlled society
01:07:33 cause I am interested in
01:07:35 progressing and making
01:07:37 cooler shit really I'm talking about making art
01:07:39 to make like the iPhone 8 or you know
01:07:41 to like get to the next level whatever
01:07:43 yeah go to Mars
01:07:45 what you would do is you should make
01:07:47 sci-fi fantasy
01:07:49 so that scientists will be
01:07:51 inspired to make new
01:07:53 I totally agree but yeah
01:07:55 but I don't care about that as much as you seem to
01:07:57 I'm curious
01:07:59 Ben brought up just the concept of
01:08:01 value itself and like what we define
01:08:03 as having value and I think you were saying
01:08:05 that there is no inherent value and it's just what we
01:08:07 there absolutely isn't
01:08:09 I mean it depends on what level you're talking about cause like
01:08:11 at the deepest foundation at some point
01:08:13 yes we have to decide what we think is valuable
01:08:15 such as human life or
01:08:17 or currency or you know all those things
01:08:19 we have basically decided to place
01:08:21 value on so I guess that's your point
01:08:23 that is my point that is ultimately
01:08:25 what Bob boils down to
01:08:27 yeah it depends on whether you think
01:08:29 I mean I guess you know our nature
01:08:31 as humans to procreate and keep
01:08:33 the species going is like
01:08:35 do you believe that that's you know something
01:08:37 that you agree with do you agree with your nature
01:08:39 or do you not care and think everything
01:08:41 is valueless I just think that
01:08:43 at a basic human level
01:08:45 we are more or less
01:08:47 all able to agree
01:08:49 on like the rules of the game you know
01:08:51 what are generally winning moves and what are
01:08:53 generally losing moves and
01:08:55 I think what just once we've
01:08:57 established that then you can build a society
01:08:59 and I don't think it's crazy
01:09:01 to establish rules like
01:09:03 life is generally preferable to death
01:09:05 and like pleasure or
01:09:07 I guess lack of pain is better
01:09:09 than pain you know like
01:09:11 things like that and then from there you can
01:09:13 find out ways to
01:09:15 pursue all that stuff and that's what I base my shit on
01:09:17 here's the point here's
01:09:19 what it all boils down to this is a spoiler
01:09:21 I'm gonna spoil the end
01:09:23 of the rabbi's cat
01:09:25 it's a good movie you should watch it
01:09:27 and don't let me spoil it but I'm gonna spoil it anyway
01:09:29 you see the rabbi
01:09:31 and the Russian guy
01:09:33 and like a fucking
01:09:35 what's the word for like a Muslim priest is it an imam
01:09:37 I think it might be an imam yeah I think that's right
01:09:39 yeah and an imam and
01:09:41 a couple other guys
01:09:43 like some painter guy
01:09:45 they all get together
01:09:47 and they embark on
01:09:49 they embark on a quest
01:09:51 across Africa
01:09:53 to find
01:09:55 the shared
01:09:57 ancestors of all blacks and
01:09:59 Jews
01:10:01 they believe that all blacks
01:10:03 and all Jews share a common ancestor
01:10:05 and they find a tribe
01:10:07 and they find
01:10:09 a tribe like hidden in Africa
01:10:11 of these giant
01:10:13 they kind of like Aztec looking warriors
01:10:15 but like they're so dark
01:10:17 that like they're blue like they're literally blue
01:10:19 and they're just
01:10:21 giant like 10 foot tall dudes
01:10:23 and they're all these big like fucking
01:10:25 like African warriors living in this
01:10:27 in this temple city reading the Torah
01:10:29 and like fucking giving each other
01:10:31 giving each other bar mitzvahs and stuff
01:10:33 and they're there and they're like hey our brethren
01:10:35 but like you know they're so fucking
01:10:37 removed from their culture
01:10:39 that they can't even fucking understand what they're saying
01:10:41 they don't even they're just
01:10:43 even though these guys come trying to forge a connection
01:10:45 they're like oh shit an intruder
01:10:47 we're so fucking we're so removed from culture
01:10:49 that like we can't understand this as anything other than
01:10:51 an intrusion and we must destroy
01:10:53 and so it doesn't really work
01:10:55 they do find the shared ancestor
01:10:57 of all blacks and Jews
01:10:59 but they do not make peaceful content
01:11:01 contact contact
01:11:03 and it's a really good movie
01:11:05 I mean isn't I mean so
01:11:07 there were like people in Saudi Arabia
01:11:09 and then Muhammad was born
01:11:11 and then you know
01:11:13 like people became Islamic
01:11:15 and the rest is history
01:11:17 but I don't think those people were Jews though
01:11:19 I think they were unrelated
01:11:21 I don't think that there actually is a
01:11:23 fucking common I don't fucking
01:11:25 I can't speak to the fucking historical
01:11:27 veracity of anything that I just said
01:11:29 that's just what happens in the movie
01:11:31 that's the end of the story
01:11:33 I don't know
01:11:35 does that have any
01:11:37 no that has absolutely no bearing on anything
01:11:39 I just wanted to say it because it's really funny
01:11:41 I was trying to
01:11:43 figure it out
01:11:45 this is not going anywhere
01:11:47 fair enough
01:11:49 like most of Ben's contributions
01:11:51 adds nothing to the podcast
01:11:53 so thanks again for that Ben
01:11:55 I was thinking about what the rabbi said
01:11:57 what was it, women literature
01:11:59 and something else
01:12:01 yeah it was something women in literature
01:12:03 and that's all he cares about
01:12:05 and he said it was for young men
01:12:07 the rabbi said those are for
01:12:09 young men
01:12:11 they have a purpose
01:12:13 not for me, I'm old
01:12:15 maybe his point, maybe we were totally wrong
01:12:17 and he's more like a guy that when you're young
01:12:19 pursue these things to develop a life
01:12:21 philosophy but when you're old stick with it
01:12:23 or something like that
01:12:25 if a thing's value
01:12:27 eventually goes away
01:12:29 and you're no longer valuable once you're old
01:12:31 was it ever fucking valuable
01:12:33 I mean maybe his point is just that
01:12:35 our brains solidify and we're not as able
01:12:37 to absorb new ideas in an effective way
01:12:39 but this fucking comes back around to that thing
01:12:41 about how I hate to think
01:12:43 I don't believe that art's value is
01:12:45 the fucking pragmatic
01:12:47 the tangible benefits that it has
01:12:49 unlike it makes us function better
01:12:51 I don't accept that
01:12:53 we need to talk to this guy and get his point
01:12:55 I think all value in everything is completely subjective
01:12:57 I disagree
01:12:59 of course
01:13:01 for me
01:13:03 I don't think
01:13:05 art is valuable
01:13:07 because young men read it
01:13:09 and it makes them better people
01:13:11 I don't think that's good enough and I hate that
01:13:13 if that's what this rabbi believed
01:13:15 then I have to say that I'm not satisfied
01:13:17 with it
01:13:19 I think that art just isn't valuable because
01:13:21 people watch it
01:13:23 and people are dumb and they don't deserve it
01:13:25 yeah
01:13:27 people who make it dumb too
01:13:29 I think that art is only worthless
01:13:31 so much in that human beings are worthless
01:13:33 well that's
01:13:35 if human beings are worthless and art is
01:13:37 for human beings
01:13:39 I think that art is
01:13:41 for me
01:13:43 and I think that human beings just exist
01:13:45 to ruin art wherever they go
01:13:47 by not being me and not appreciating it
01:13:49 correctly
01:13:51 but that's not what I was going to say
01:13:53 and I
01:13:55 one day you and me will pull a Columbine
01:13:57 in this whole country Jesse
01:13:59 and then we'll find out
01:14:01 who's the real artist in town
01:14:03 and we'll find out who's the real procrastinator
01:14:05 yeah we'll get around to Columbining America
01:14:07 eventually
01:14:09 we all get together
01:14:11 we all get together for Radcon 10
01:14:13 and we're just like
01:14:15 and you know Digi's just passing out guns
01:14:17 and he's like are you with us
01:14:19 or against us
01:14:21 if we fucking get to 10 Radcons
01:14:23 I will start killing people
01:14:25 not even a joke
01:14:27 somebody's gotta start dying by then
01:14:29 somebody's gotta die
01:14:31 yep
01:14:33 to keep the content fresh somebody has to die each time
01:14:35 we have to
01:14:37 we do like a poem
01:14:39 I definitely think that we're the critical mass
01:14:41 where if we add any new members
01:14:43 an old member needs to leave this fucking group
01:14:45 yeah
01:14:47 hey maybe now's a good time to bring up the fact that
01:14:49 hey guys over
01:14:51 we've been getting messages every once in a while
01:14:53 just saying like hey dude what do I have to do to join the PCP
01:14:55 and like oh I can't wait till I can join
01:14:57 I just want to let everybody know
01:14:59 that we are not looking for new members
01:15:01 and if you're confused by Munchie and
01:15:03 Munky's recent addition
01:15:05 those are guys that we've known for a while
01:15:07 especially Munchie
01:15:09 and like they were always sort of
01:15:11 like there are buddies and they were sort of being introduced
01:15:13 after a while
01:15:15 a terrible mistake has been made somewhere along the line
01:15:17 they accidentally presented the PCP
01:15:19 as like a club
01:15:21 I think giving it a name even
01:15:23 was wrong cause we're
01:15:25 yeah it was a necessary evil though
01:15:27 cause we had to call it something
01:15:29 yeah like I never set out to be part of a club
01:15:31 I don't consider myself part of a group
01:15:33 I just these are
01:15:35 this is a goofy podcast with guys that I
01:15:37 kind of like sometimes
01:15:39 and
01:15:41 I don't know I just see you guys as friends
01:15:43 and we're not a fucking like coalition
01:15:45 aggression to add people
01:15:47 if anymore people get added
01:15:49 I never
01:15:51 saw it that way either but like
01:15:53 the people that listen sometimes
01:15:55 do seem to see it that way and they love it
01:15:57 so I mean
01:15:59 if they choose to interpret it that way
01:16:01 that's fine and I've wanted to work with you guys
01:16:03 for years which is why we started this
01:16:05 so that we could do something and there's no
01:16:07 avoiding being grouped together
01:16:09 when you're making something so
01:16:11 it's a sacrifice I'm willing to
01:16:13 there's no
01:16:15 path to like earning your way in
01:16:17 it's just
01:16:19 the PCP is just who we all
01:16:21 happen to know and like
01:16:23 and you know occasionally maybe want to
01:16:25 fucking work with on stuff
01:16:27 like Mumpy was a guy who we found
01:16:29 and we all instantly liked and then we got
01:16:31 to know him over
01:16:33 like a year and then it was just like
01:16:35 hey let's just bring him in to do stuff
01:16:37 and then it just was perfectly natural
01:16:39 to add him so I mean just you know
01:16:41 if you're a creator and you are making
01:16:43 perfect stuff I don't know maybe
01:16:45 all that is is that
01:16:47 you know people will just think well
01:16:49 I mean they say I'm not allowed in
01:16:51 but if I'm like a really good content creator
01:16:53 maybe they'll just like me and they'll
01:16:55 look I have a problem with that
01:16:57 if you're a pretty girl
01:16:59 if you're a pretty girl and you have sex with me
01:17:01 then you can be my friend
01:17:03 but you still can't be in my fucking
01:17:05 PCP
01:17:07 I wanted to hear where Hippo is going with that
01:17:09 well I mean
01:17:11 people are going to like assume they can
01:17:13 like if they make good enough content
01:17:15 they can get in the group and that's
01:17:17 the thing is
01:17:19 it's not like we're saying
01:17:21 no one will ever be our friend
01:17:23 because that's not true we will make friends
01:17:25 eventually with other people who are cool
01:17:27 it's just that this particular group
01:17:29 it's not really
01:17:31 like it's not really something
01:17:33 you can join and just suddenly be in the chat
01:17:35 we'll make friends
01:17:37 we'll make friends and make connections
01:17:39 and be in like other little groups
01:17:41 but it's just this is sort of like full
01:17:43 we're just getting a lot
01:17:45 of prepositions lately
01:17:47 from people that we then have to
01:17:49 spurn and break their hearts
01:17:51 it's like being a single white woman
01:17:53 guys are coming after me sniffing around my cooter
01:17:55 I just want to focus on my career
01:17:57 I just want to be a lawyer
01:17:59 in the big city
01:18:01 in the big city and make it on your own
01:18:03 it's like being the only femme boy
01:18:05 in the house dance
01:18:07 everyone wants your attention
01:18:09 and you can't service everybody
01:18:11 who comes knocking at your cell door
01:18:13 there's only enough booty for one man at a time
01:18:15 that's right
01:18:17 so
01:18:19 stop asking that question
01:18:21 that's the fucking point fuck off
01:18:23 shut up
01:18:25 shut up and fuck off
01:18:27 but we love you anyway
01:18:29 we do
01:18:31 so should we swing back
01:18:33 do you have time to tell us your stories now dawg
01:18:35 I mean I can
01:18:37 I feel like we've gone off the
01:18:39 existential deep end
01:18:41 that's true
01:18:43 I just wanted to give you an opportunity
01:18:45 maybe there's one that's particularly
01:18:47 interesting or something
01:18:49 the only one that was even
01:18:51 semi interesting was when I almost killed myself
01:18:53 from working too hard
01:18:55 that sounds relevant
01:18:57 I don't think I've heard it
01:18:59 I think I've heard bits and pieces of it
01:19:01 it was back when
01:19:03 I first got started doing horse stuff
01:19:05 and I was working a job
01:19:07 and I was working all night on making
01:19:09 the picture book
01:19:11 and I was downing tons of
01:19:13 energy drinks
01:19:15 I had like 3 a day
01:19:17 and my heart was like
01:19:19 tweaking out and I had to go to the hospital
01:19:21 and I was there for like a few hours
01:19:23 I was sitting with my dad
01:19:25 he was just like fucking retarded
01:19:27 and I'm like yeah that's true
01:19:29 they had me hooked up to one of those
01:19:31 part beat monitor thing
01:19:33 am I still in this?
01:19:35 and it was weird because we like skip a beat
01:19:37 every time you go see it as it did it
01:19:39 oh my god
01:19:41 it just shut off
01:19:43 oh fuck my dad's like
01:19:45 I gotta get somebody like the equipment
01:19:47 fucked up and I'm like yeah I guess
01:19:49 and then like 3 seconds later my whole body went numb
01:19:51 and cold
01:19:53 and I was just like
01:19:55 it's not the equipment
01:19:57 at the time I assume you were
01:19:59 I couldn't move
01:20:01 it felt like instantly I was in a freezer
01:20:03 cause like my heart stopped so there was no blood circulating
01:20:05 and I was just dying
01:20:07 and for like it was a solid like 15 seconds
01:20:09 before it like beat
01:20:11 really hard and like my whole body jolted
01:20:13 and it started again
01:20:15 and like
01:20:17 the closest I came to death was like
01:20:19 when my heart stopped for like a very noticeable
01:20:21 amount of time
01:20:23 fascinating
01:20:25 and on that note thank you for listening
01:20:27 to the Procrest days
01:20:29 speaking of death
01:20:31 did I miss anything?
01:20:33 no I mean you can listen back he told a story
01:20:35 and it was equally traumatic as the first time I heard it
01:20:37 I missed it
01:20:39 I missed it
01:20:41 listen back god damn it it was the rest of the audience it'll be there
01:20:43 tell it again make the audience
01:20:45 I've never listened to a PCP
01:20:47 episode and I won't start now
01:20:49 what a hero
01:20:51 alright well how about we
01:20:53 shift over to questions now what do you say folks
01:20:55 let's do it
01:20:57 we have run for over an hour
01:20:59 we're at an hour and 20 minutes
01:21:01 let's see here
01:21:03 what do we got
01:21:05 I think there was some
01:21:07 decent ones here
01:21:09 fill time
01:21:11 somebody fill time give
01:21:13 what's your favorite color
01:21:15 blue
01:21:17 you're fired
01:21:19 that's the one
01:21:21 what the reference
01:21:23 hey here's a fun one to fill a little bit of time
01:21:25 ok by
01:21:27 at batsling1234
01:21:29 would someone take up this challenge
01:21:31 describe the PCP to someone who
01:21:33 never uses the internet
01:21:35 oh man it's a bunch of guys
01:21:37 and a girl
01:21:39 and then mage
01:21:41 oh got her
01:21:45 who's the girl no one will know
01:21:47 it's a loose coalition
01:21:49 of gays
01:21:51 in a straight world
01:21:53 united against the oppressive
01:21:55 matriarchy
01:21:57 do you remember that one kid in your
01:21:59 kindergarten class that ate glue
01:22:01 imagine if there were like seven of them
01:22:03 and they all talked to each other for an hour
01:22:05 do you say that was you Gib?
01:22:07 I didn't eat glue I like putting glue on my hands
01:22:09 and peeling it off when it dried
01:22:11 oh fuck yeah dude oh fuck yeah
01:22:13 that was the shit that was the jam dog
01:22:15 I'm serious
01:22:17 I remember doing that a little bit
01:22:19 ok here's another question
01:22:21 oh shit where'd it go
01:22:23 oh Gib this one is directed at you
01:22:25 it's actually not specifically but it's for you
01:22:27 it's just have any of the PCP members
01:22:29 played Fire Emblem Heroes
01:22:31 and what are your thoughts in your main
01:22:33 teams
01:22:35 let me look at my main team right now
01:22:37 I'm playing this game currently as well
01:22:39 oh yeah I'm not playing it because
01:22:41 I already played too many mobile games
01:22:43 I got Lisa
01:22:45 from Fire Emblem Awakening
01:22:47 Florina from my favorite game ever
01:22:49 Kane from something
01:22:51 and Faye the dragon
01:22:53 and I got their like four and five star
01:22:55 characters and they're really good and the game
01:22:57 is great and I like it and it's good and I like it
01:22:59 so I was just curious oh sorry
01:23:01 go on top go on top I was just going to say I only started a couple days ago
01:23:03 I have nobody good my
01:23:05 my summons have been shitty
01:23:07 I only have three star guys except for one
01:23:09 four star ninja dude who's kind of cool
01:23:11 the game is really fun
01:23:13 yeah you got fucked
01:23:15 and every time my guy levels there's just like one stat boost
01:23:17 and like that's it so like I can't even win
01:23:19 the training mission now so I might have just restart
01:23:21 entirely
01:23:23 the only thing I don't like is the fact
01:23:25 and not even that I don't like it but I just find it odd
01:23:27 that because they outsourced all the art to a bunch of different people
01:23:29 like there's like 15 different art styles in the game
01:23:31 and it doesn't really match very well
01:23:33 I thought they were recycling art styles from like the original
01:23:35 games for some is that not true
01:23:37 no they're all different
01:23:39 but some of them definitely look more interesting
01:23:41 what's annoying
01:23:43 I can see why that would clash
01:23:45 I would at least expect it to be like one
01:23:47 by the way the voice actor
01:23:49 for Florina is the cutest
01:23:51 ever and if you get her you will enjoy
01:23:53 the fact that she goes um
01:23:55 when you look on her
01:23:57 please make a video where you document
01:23:59 these audio sounds because they're not on the internet
01:24:01 and I want to hear that
01:24:03 yeah I will I'm going to make a miniscule review
01:24:05 oh excellent fantastic
01:24:07 I'm looking forward to it
01:24:09 what was I going to say
01:24:11 the only reason I'm at all tempted to play that game
01:24:13 is because I'm sure it's the reason 99%
01:24:15 of people play because I want to see
01:24:17 Camilla and Lynn and just
01:24:19 you know just be around them because they're the hottest women
01:24:21 you know ever that's it
01:24:23 that's the only reason
01:24:25 there's like a 3% rate of getting
01:24:27 like one of those 5 star characters
01:24:29 so you have to grind to infinity
01:24:31 yeah I'm very lucky in that
01:24:33 I've already got two 5 stars
01:24:35 so that's cool
01:24:37 here's a question
01:24:39 Jesse this one's for you
01:24:41 how do I become a sweet shirt
01:24:43 first of all does he even want to be
01:24:45 a sweet shirt
01:24:47 sweet shirts good yeah you just got to wear
01:24:49 sweet shirts yeah it's a combination
01:24:51 of the sweet boy and the shit shirt
01:24:53 but it's not like actually a combination
01:24:55 it's just a combination of the word
01:24:57 well no a sweet boy is bad
01:24:59 the shit shirt is definitely bad
01:25:01 a sweet probably the worst
01:25:03 but a sweet shirt
01:25:05 is like right in that happy medium
01:25:07 of traits for a human to possess
01:25:09 damn
01:25:11 all you got to do is describe yourself as a sweet shirt
01:25:13 what about a shit boy
01:25:15 oh the best
01:25:17 I haven't quite cracked the code on shit boy yet
01:25:21 I think I'd like to give that one a spin
01:25:23 you know all you got to do to be a sweet shirt
01:25:25 is just just wear sweet
01:25:27 shirts damn
01:25:29 and uh you know
01:25:31 yeah but I mean it's
01:25:33 like a fellow it's a minute to learn a lifetime
01:25:35 to master yeah that's right
01:25:37 you know it's more complicated people think
01:25:39 I mean people don't realize you know what
01:25:41 constitutes a sweet shirt you can't just throw
01:25:43 any old rag on you can't just have some
01:25:45 shirt with some shit you like on it because
01:25:47 some shirts are cluttered the designs are too
01:25:49 complicated some shirt you know
01:25:51 I'll give you I'll give people some advice for
01:25:53 finding a sweet shirt
01:25:55 look for simplicity look for like
01:25:57 something that's iconic look for logos
01:25:59 always be on the lookout for logos
01:26:01 and and that like the
01:26:03 Patreon like the Patriot
01:26:05 yeah I should get a shirt with that
01:26:07 that's the one who did that
01:26:09 there was that who was always that fan art
01:26:11 of the PCP logo made out of patreons
01:26:13 that was dude Tom did that Tom made
01:26:15 that dude
01:26:17 fan of all a guy who's here
01:26:19 that's great you know that's a
01:26:21 that's an emote that's a fucking
01:26:23 reaction image or an emoticon or whatever you
01:26:25 fucking call them in the in the fan discord
01:26:27 now I saw that I saw that
01:26:29 I have a shirt press at home
01:26:31 it's oh my god dude
01:26:33 let's get serious let's talk about this
01:26:35 let's talk about about selling these
01:26:37 things why don't we have that
01:26:39 that's because it takes effort and I'm the
01:26:41 only one who does anything besides Jesse besides
01:26:43 Digi who edits them together I'll do that
01:26:45 and the iTunes Jesus Christ someone has to
01:26:47 fucking step up to the plate I know someone
01:26:49 does oh by the way I'm sorry
01:26:51 I wanted to say the names of people after
01:26:53 these questions I forgot to the fire emblem
01:26:55 question was by at hooded lefty
01:26:57 and the
01:26:59 fuck where those good fucking question
01:27:01 I can't remember what it was
01:27:03 the the sweet shirt was by at track
01:27:05 master track so thanks guys and
01:27:07 one more question here and this was actually
01:27:09 I'm taking this one because this is personal
01:27:11 Jesse this is sort of a question for you
01:27:13 this actually wasn't a question at all it was
01:27:15 just I'm taking it because I have
01:27:17 a personal interest because I watched a video about
01:27:19 it even though I didn't watch it
01:27:21 I only the only good royal rumble
01:27:23 this year was by at TP
01:27:25 crashed by the procrastinators
01:27:27 fuck Roman those by Jen is
01:27:29 maku do Mario and I
01:27:31 was just wondering I I tweeted before
01:27:33 there was this compilation of everyone
01:27:35 disappointed that the 30th Royal Rumbleman
01:27:37 was fucking Roman Reigns
01:27:39 and I was just wondering how that worked out what
01:27:41 went down well they just they just
01:27:43 won't they just won't quit
01:27:45 they won't give up on the Roman Reigns they won't
01:27:47 accept that like Roman Reigns is not going
01:27:49 to happen they they can't accept it
01:27:51 and they keep trying it's been like
01:27:53 like three years of him getting boot out of
01:27:55 the building and he just won't stop
01:27:57 did he win did he
01:27:59 win the thing thank God but it's like it was
01:28:01 especially dumb because like he had already
01:28:03 had a match earlier in the night
01:28:05 Oh for like
01:28:07 okay and like the match earlier in
01:28:09 the night was for the championship
01:28:11 and he lost and
01:28:13 the good like the prize
01:28:15 of the Royal Rumble is a chance
01:28:17 to get a championship match
01:28:19 so it's like
01:28:21 if he was already in a championship
01:28:23 match that night and lost how
01:28:25 in the fuck did he get a spot
01:28:27 in the Royal Rumble that's a great 10 minutes
01:28:29 like you assume that the spots are
01:28:31 filled up before the fucking show starts
01:28:33 like did he go up did he go
01:28:35 after his match and like assassinate
01:28:37 whoever was supposed to be number 30
01:28:39 and take this spot if he if he did if they
01:28:41 had showed that it would have been okay
01:28:43 but they it's just a weird I hope dumb
01:28:45 plot hole
01:28:47 it was glue man it was gonna be the
01:28:49 glue man glue man who was finally
01:28:51 about to make his debut and Roman took him out
01:28:53 that monster
01:28:55 I was gonna say that
01:28:57 there was there was another new contender
01:28:59 was gonna take that 30th spot
01:29:01 but he was assassinated and the crowd could just hear
01:29:03 the faint
01:29:05 from backstage
01:29:07 during the
01:29:09 during the vile act

01:31:03 extensive lore
01:31:05 that lore didn't even exist until he started
01:31:07 writing that page and he's just going ham
01:31:09 feel flushing out

01:31:13 he's been established that the undertailer
