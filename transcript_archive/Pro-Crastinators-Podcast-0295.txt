00:00:00 This is for PCP. They say it's the worst podcast on the internet. F-f-correct.
00:00:16 Okay, it's another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's started. We just started hitting
00:00:22 the start button. We're going. We're live. Hi, everybody. Oh, my fucking god. It's me, Ben Saint.
00:00:32 I'm here. We've got guests. We've got more guests than hosts. It's fucked up.
00:00:39 It's real fucked. Okay, we got Oblivionfall is back, of course.
00:00:44 Yes, I'm here, and I'm editing this episode probably.
00:00:48 And we've also got a C-Toll and Four Eyes are here. Do you want to introduce yourselves?
00:00:56 No. I mean, hello.
00:01:01 It's me. Four Eyes, you know me. I'll introduce C-Toll. I'll mansplain. A C-Toll runs the drawcast
00:01:11 with me, and we've had cool guests on, like Ben Saint and Gibbontake and Teleperte,
00:01:17 and we'll get Tom one day, too. The drawcast. The drawcast, your own original creation. Do
00:01:26 not steal a YouTube show where you draw. It's a podcast where you draw. It's like a portmanteau.
00:01:36 Yeah. It's a good show with good people and Ben Saint. Good people and Ben Saint.
00:01:42 It's a good show. It's a good show. Yeah. C-Toll, you gave me a gift.
00:01:53 You gave me a priceless gift that could never be replaced. And you know what? Okay, I'm going to
00:01:59 say it. It could say if it was not functioning. Right. This week, it's time. It's been long enough.
00:02:06 By the end of this week, by the time this episode comes out, I'm going to have announced it. I'm
00:02:09 putting the time limit on myself. So I'm just going to say what it is. You gave me the funny
00:02:14 a DVD, a Blu-ray burner. You gave me the Blu-ray burner for me to create the plebe and the wee
00:02:21 Blu-rays, which I have made and which do exist and which you can buy from me now. Oh, shit.
00:02:28 After Trixie stole everyone's money and didn't deliver on them. And then you gave Trixie the
00:02:33 Blu-ray burner. Yeah. And then she just took it and was like, okay, and didn't make them and didn't
00:02:40 give it back when you asked for it back. Yeah. LaMalle. She was like, she was like, if someone
00:02:44 got me the Blu-ray burner, I would make them. I have the Blu-rays. I have the cases, but I don't
00:02:50 have the burner. It's not, it's even worse. It's even worse. It wasn't like if someone, it's not
00:02:56 like, oh, well, if someone gets it for me, then I'll make them. Which like, there was the bit where
00:03:02 she said, where she said, like, what am I supposed to do? Just pick myself up on my bootstraps and
00:03:08 buy a Blu-ray burner. Yes. As though that isn't a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Right.
00:03:15 You said you were going to make Blu-rays, ma'am. You were supposed to make Blu-rays.
00:03:19 Yes. And people paid me, what am I supposed, with what money? The money people gave me to do exactly
00:03:25 that? What are you, stupid? Yes. That was, that was tricksy. Then I'm like, oh man. Yes. So anyway,
00:03:32 anyway, okay, I'll show a picture on screen because I have gone above and beyond. I have,
00:03:38 they have Blu-ray cases. They have the boxes. They have a cover art. They have a cover sleeve.
00:03:44 They have a back of the box. They have reviews, rave reviews of the, of the product. They have,
00:03:52 they're, they're the printed on disc. They have a disc design on them. They have DVD menus and stuff.
00:03:59 Navigate them with your remote control and your Blu-ray player. They are a professional product
00:04:04 that I have spent months making just out of spite. Anyway, anyway. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of
00:04:13 you, Ben. Thank you. Thank you. Buy one. Everyone, if you think that's funny, if you, listener,
00:04:21 if you think it's funny, go to my Twitter, go to my Twitter or go into the description
00:04:27 and follow the instructions listed there and buy a copy because I did have to buy all the
00:04:32 raw materials for it. So it didn't cost me a little bit. Please don't let me come out at a loss
00:04:40 for this funny project, my funny secret project. You had to buy literally everything
00:04:45 Trixie already had except the Blu-ray burner. Right. I did. I did. Only, only it's better
00:04:50 because she was not going to make a, put them in a real, but she was going to put them in a shitty
00:04:55 jewel case and they were just going to have like a generic like no label disc. They were going to
00:04:59 look blank. She was just going to mail them in the mail. She was not going to make a professional
00:05:04 looking product. I have done, I have done that. My version is way better than hers would have been.
00:05:10 For the low, low price of $30, which is what was listed on the,
00:05:16 which is what was listed on the, on the, the Kickstarter page said they would be $30.
00:05:21 If you backed the, believe in the weed Kickstarter, I don't have, I'm, I obviously,
00:05:26 I didn't get any money. So like, I didn't get any of the Blu-ray money that would have paid,
00:05:31 that you would have paid for the product if you pledged to that. But because I'm a nice guy,
00:05:36 if you did pledge to the Pleeve and the Weeb Kickstarter, I will give, I can't give, I can't
00:05:41 give them for free because I had to buy all the materials, but I will give, I will steeply discount
00:05:46 the product. I'll give you like $20 off if you can show me proof that you are a, a $40 Kickstarter
00:05:52 backer, which was the reward which entitled you to the, to the Blu-ray if you pledged it. So I
00:05:58 don't know. Get, let me know about that. Yeah, we'll get to figure it out. Okay. Well, that's
00:06:05 my big announcement for this week. What do you guys got going on? Oh boy. The second episode with
00:06:12 Cheesy will have come out by now, I think, or will be coming out soon. You mean of the draw cast?
00:06:18 Yeah. Well, the second episode of the draw cast with Cheesy will come out, but it was actually
00:06:23 the one that was recorded first. Yeah. Because Cetol, the genius Cetol deleted their recording.
00:06:31 The genius smart man. What happened? The recording got deleted. Yeah. So was it destroyed? Was it,
00:06:39 was it ruined? Yeah, my laptop, I work on a laptop and it has fuck all memory. And it was
00:06:46 standard of the year. And I was, we'd done like three comics jams, like basically in a row. And
00:06:52 my recordings were getting corrupted because I didn't have enough space on the computer. I'm
00:06:58 like, oh, that's kind of shit. Yeah, that's kind of shit. I should start deleting some of these old
00:07:03 comics jams because they're kind of old. And I deleted the one Cheesy was on. I deleted the
00:07:09 one Cheesy was on accidentally. So, so you had to rerecord it? Oh, no, no, we did something else.
00:07:16 We did something ridiculous. The episode will be out probably the day after people see this,
00:07:22 so I don't mind spoiling it a bit. We kept the episode, at least the free other people's
00:07:28 audios, we kept me, Cheesy, and Gibb. Yeah, we give was on it too. Yeah. Yes. Gibb was on it.
00:07:36 Okay. And C.T.A.L. recorded commentary over the parts that were quiet during all the parts
00:07:42 where C.T.A.L. was talking. And I created a little pony vector like pack of C.T.A.L.
00:07:52 to do a little, a little brony analysis style commentary, you know, all the different faces.
00:07:58 And that's your answer. That's your answer to everything, Oblivion. Just make it. Why don't
00:08:02 you just make a pony vector about it? When all you've got, when all you've got is a pony vector,
00:08:08 everything looks like an analysis video. That's funny. He didn't make the vector for the video.
00:08:16 I paid him to make the vector because he lost his job. And so I wanted to never money. Then I'm
00:08:22 like, I don't know what I'm going to use this vector for. And then this happened. I'm like,
00:08:26 well now I know what I'm going to use this vector for. It's very silly. It's very good.
00:08:33 It's absolutely at least the quality of her brony analysis video. Yes. At least.
00:08:39 That amazing. Yeah. Can we, can we, can we clear that far? We did.
00:08:45 My horse moves. I think it's a bit too low. I don't think you can go lower than that. I don't
00:08:49 think you can really limbo that. My horse moves. Therefore, it's at least as good if not better
00:08:55 than some brony analysis videos. Four eyes. Yes. Why don't you explain what your deal is?
00:09:07 Oh yeah. I've just kind of been here. I'm an artist. I draw things. Oblivion.
00:09:14 That's me. I'm oblivion. I'm sorry. I'm not very good at explaining myself.
00:09:20 All right. Four eyes has relevance. I met oblivion a while ago and I do pictures for him.
00:09:26 Yeah. I have some, I have some relevance. Me and four eyes met on one fateful 9 11.
00:09:32 When he has paid money to join my Patreon server and we got talking. He was crazy. He was just
00:09:38 a fucking cool guy. And then he found out all this funny stuff about him that was good and funny.
00:09:45 Excuse me. I'm sick. Several years later. And I drew women with big tits for him.
00:09:52 Yes. Oh no. Didn't you say that four eyes was the voice of some iconic voicemail characters?
00:10:00 I wonder if you can recognize me. Well, that's what, well, I didn't know that,
00:10:04 but oblivion told me so and I believe him. Well, I mean, we can have a whole discussion of
00:10:09 about that after we go to the voicemail segment and we play the first voicemail,
00:10:14 which is a very spicy one. Oh, okay. There's a reason I'm here. I see.
00:10:19 Yeah. But like four eyes to regular PCP viewers. I mean, aside from designing my character for
00:10:26 the ComeZone videos, which I've talked about a few times before. You mean, you mean what's her
00:10:31 name? Thalia. Thalia. Yeah. The big booby demon girl. Yeah. Four eyes designed her. Yeah. We both
00:10:39 like worked together on the design and he did the art that was used in that video.
00:10:44 He gave me pointers and I did the design. The actual art that you see in the
00:10:48 ComeZone video is my art with his direction. Yeah. It's really good. And any old school
00:10:55 PCP fans who remember Roddy Fuckers, cop killers, frog fractions, all the drama with the analysis
00:11:05 and the big arc with Ms. Anfropony. I believe that Ms. Anfropony's icon that they were using
00:11:13 during all those videos was one drawn by four eyes. Back when I used to watch
00:11:20 Brony analysis videos as a wee teen, I was very absorbed into a lot of the pity stories that
00:11:28 a lot of people were bringing about. And I was like, oh, I feel bad for this guy. He has such a
00:11:34 oh man. I'm going to draw a picture of his pony. I gave it to him. Don't feel bad for Ms.
00:11:39 Anfropony. He's thriving. He is thriving. And he's not using it anymore. I've looked.
00:11:46 This image, I think. Let's see. Yeah, that's really old. The era of the pony avatar has
00:11:55 it's rare to see a pony avatar in the wild anymore. Yeah, he no longer uses this,
00:12:00 but he did for a long time. I was very surprised.
00:12:06 I love Ms. Anfropony. See him in the comments once in a while, which is nice.
00:12:12 He's around. Yeah, I see him around. He's around. Shout outs to Ms. Anfropony.
00:12:20 Okay. Yeah, good. Well, understandable. What else? I didn't do anything this week,
00:12:29 because I had coronavirus. I had coronavirus just long enough to ruin my Christmas and my New
00:12:39 Years. Because I was still. Me too. Congratulations. Yeah. Thanks. I was sick on Christmas. I felt
00:12:51 sick. I had a fever and I felt awful. Just terrible. And I thought I was over. I haven't
00:12:59 had any symptoms since basically since the last PCP, so basically a week now. I've had no symptoms,
00:13:07 but I tested myself yesterday, or no, day before yesterday, thinking I was over it for New Years.
00:13:14 And no, I was still positive. Sad times. So I'm just like, I got to get another test and I'm just
00:13:23 waiting until, well, when will I be? When will I be negative? When can I return to society?
00:13:32 Yeah, I got sick with. So I haven't just been at home. Just been working on the game. Just been
00:13:37 working really hard every day, all day, 24 hours a day, adding totally frivolous features to
00:13:45 slime and punishment, Phantom's Revenge. How dare you, Ben. Completely pointless, huge waste of
00:13:51 time. But I mean, aren't video games just a big waste of time anyway? So that's probably good,
00:13:57 actually. That's how I know I'm ready to do it. How dare Ben saying, make progress on his game,
00:14:04 thus driving up his Patreon dollars further away from me? I wouldn't call it progress,
00:14:10 exactly. I would call it wheel spinning. I would call it, I'm adding, basically what it is, is I'm
00:14:18 adding a bunch of frivolous features to the game that I didn't need, but that I keep thinking,
00:14:22 oh, this would be funny. Oh, that would, oh, that would be cute. And then I'll spend three days
00:14:26 doing it. And then that's three days that I don't have to spend doing the boring work of
00:14:32 making the itch page or figuring out how to upload on new grounds or et cetera, et cetera.
00:14:37 What else can you do? He already dabs. He already plays for it. He already dabs. I won't say,
00:14:44 I won't say exactly, but I will say that it, I feel exactly, I'm adding stuff that you can do in
00:14:52 Endless War. I'm adding stuff, that stuff as commands in a fandom's revenge. And it feels
00:14:58 just like it did when I was making Endless War in the first place, because I remember thinking,
00:15:04 like, the, what if you could do this stupid thing, lol, okay. And then I spent like two days just
00:15:09 being like, um, take a, take a, take a, take a, put that. Okay, now it works. Only this time,
00:15:14 I don't have to send it off to crack. So he can be like, this doesn't work at all. Here,
00:15:17 I redid it. And now it works. Now it just, now it just works because I'm doing it in Game Maker.
00:15:23 So nice. Phantom Horn can fish and dig through garbage and grow crops.
00:15:31 I'm speakable. Listen, stop spoiling it. Stop spoiling it.
00:15:35 It sounds like, it sounds like you're just remaking Stardew Valley, but with Phantom
00:15:40 Horn. I'm all for it. I'm not, I'm not going to say anything else.
00:15:50 Oh, that's great. For as you've been doing some game making.
00:15:56 Me? Yeah, you have some game. Oh yeah, I have. Wait, what? I mean, yes. I've, that was like,
00:16:04 that was like the beginning of the year though. It is the beginning of the year.
00:16:09 Oh, you're right. It was the beginning of last year. I did it a year ago. Yeah, no. Jesus.
00:16:16 A long time ago, I was doing game development. I was helping a friend with an RPG maker game.
00:16:21 And it, it's like a niche of a niche thing. So it's, I don't think it's worth plugging too much.
00:16:26 You know, if you know, like any RPG maker games that got popular back in the early
00:16:30 2010s, then, then you know what kind of game it's like. It's a fangame all for a game like that.
00:16:37 I have been helping somebody else recently, but I'm not directly helping. They just want
00:16:41 artwork and I'm good at providing artwork. I, I would hope I am at least. Yeah, so.
00:16:47 Before you said you were, you tell me you were like learning how to like make a game engine or
00:16:51 something. Oh, oh, that's a whole side thing. That's like, I'm learning to, I'm learning to
00:16:58 program and I want to build my own game engine because fuck learning how to use something like
00:17:03 Unity or RPG maker. There's so many limitations with those engines that make me go, why can't I just
00:17:08 do that? And that's a whole thing. I barely even started. I think I've got like some logic.
00:17:14 And why couldn't you? I mean, for RPG maker, especially there's a huge restriction with
00:17:21 what you can do there. But it's like, it's one of the easiest engines to learn because it,
00:17:26 it uses a, I think it's called low coding, where instead of actually typing out code,
00:17:30 you just put in commands and it just plays them in a sequence. It's, it's just a bunch of presets
00:17:35 that you play off. I know that a game maker has its own, like dedicated programming language,
00:17:42 right? Probably. It does. Yeah, GML. Yeah. I've been told that's pretty good, but it has its own
00:17:48 restrictions as well that make people go, why can't I just have an actual programming language?
00:17:53 GML Gay Mer Life. Oh, no. I, you know, I was, I was originally, my initial
00:18:03 thought was I was going to make Phantom's Revenge in RPG maker. But I found I,
00:18:11 I'm sure there would have been ways to do it, but it was, I was, I found it like impossible to do
00:18:16 like really basic things that I, like all, like I just wanted to rename the fucking health bar.
00:18:23 And I, I don't know. I couldn't figure out how to do it. I believe there is a way to do that,
00:18:30 but I think it only does it for certain things. I know in 2003, there's like a thing in the database
00:18:35 that lets you change a whole bunch of terms that the game uses. You can change like HP to
00:18:41 Googity Boogity and a new game to this closes the game, but secretly actually makes a new game.
00:18:49 There's just, I mean, those are like very basic restrictions that's like, why can't I just rename
00:18:53 it? Right? Yeah, because like, I don't know. I guess maybe if I had learned, what is it,
00:18:59 it runs on like Ruby, right? Is the scripting? Oh yeah, the old ones do. Anything, anything
00:19:05 before RPG maker MV uses Ruby. Once it reaches MV though, it uses, I think, I forget it's a Java
00:19:11 or JavaScript, but it's one of those two. Yeah. Well, I knew, I didn't know any Ruby. I knew,
00:19:16 I knew some GML. So I don't know. I was just, I was just like, I was struggling with that.
00:19:23 And then I was like, well, shit, if I can't, if I can't, I'm having, if I'm having so much
00:19:26 trouble figuring out something as basic as just changing the name of like a function in the game,
00:19:31 it's like, well, I feel like I'm going to be like struggling against this system the whole time.
00:19:37 And I should probably just like, yeah, that's the problem with the, I'm just going to use GML.
00:19:42 That's the problem with RPG maker, like development in general, when a lot of people go
00:19:47 into it because it's an easy engine to learn. It seems like it really, really is set up with the
00:19:52 idea that it is, it is to make it as easy as possible to make a like the most generic RPG.
00:19:59 Yeah. You can imagine. And, and like, you can deviate from that, but like,
00:20:04 you have to do a lot of juggling around. You have to like, you have to work for it. Yeah.
00:20:09 I, I fucking had to do so much shit in RP, or like in 2003 alone, it's actually the most versatile
00:20:16 one as far as I'm concerned, but that might just be because I'm very knowledgeable in it.
00:20:21 But like, if you ever want to do anything in a, in that engine, you have, you can't really
00:20:27 rely on the engine itself. So you want like a character to be like half a half a tile across,
00:20:32 like if you really want to have this very specific thing happen, then you can't actually
00:20:37 use them to walk half a tile, you need to have like, you need to make the illusion of someone
00:20:41 walking, AKA like put a picture on screen and have it move. And in that case, you're basically
00:20:46 just building an engine on top of RPG maker as you start building more and more things that you
00:20:50 don't want from the game. And that's the limitation that RPG maker developers really have. They want
00:20:55 to do something more. But the problem is the engine is optimized in such a way to only do
00:21:02 you know, this one thing. Yeah, it's a, you gotta work within the restrictions. And if
00:21:07 you're knowledgeable, maybe you can make something impressive. RPG maker seems like it's set up so
00:21:12 that like basically a child can like turn it on and make something that is technically an RPG.
00:21:20 Yes, that's pretty much it. Yeah, it's yeah, you just see so many of these. Oh yeah, cool. My guy
00:21:25 has HP and he's got a little bar and he can do spells and it's technically it's a video game.
00:21:30 Yeah, that's why you see so much, you know, just free, very trashy RPG maker games. It's why,
00:21:38 in fact, the RPG aspect of RPG maker is often so confusing for people that they don't even make it
00:21:44 for RPGs. The most popular RPG maker games come to think of it are all like top down survival
00:21:50 horror type things where you don't fight things, you just walk around and try to run away from
00:21:56 other creatures because it's easier to just deal with the overworld than it is the combat balance
00:22:00 because I've tried messing with it is so confusing. They do things in like, I guess if you understand
00:22:06 it, it makes sense. But like, you just think, why can't I have like a character do this action on
00:22:11 this turn? You can't tell what you can't force like anything to happen cinematically in a battle.
00:22:17 And it's really, it's really annoying. Yeah. Yeah. I know that didn't didn't
00:22:22 undertale start development and RPG maker and then get ported to a game maker at some point.
00:22:29 I think I read that somewhere. I don't remember that. But I do know that Delta Rune was originally
00:22:35 going to be done on a different engine. But eventually, Toby Fox was just like, yeah, no,
00:22:40 learning this new engine isn't really going to help. I've got like years of experience in
00:22:45 game maker already. So I'll just stick with that. Yeah, I feel like I've reached I feel like I've
00:22:50 reached a point where I am just like, I just kind of like know how to do a thing. And I just am not
00:23:00 I'm no longer like, how do I do this? How do you know, because when I started out, you have to like
00:23:06 look shit up. Oh, yeah, tell you learn to code. You just fucking open up the wiki or whatever,
00:23:12 and you just open up like a guy and you got to look shit up. And now I'm kind of just like,
00:23:16 I mostly know. I mostly know what I'm doing. Yeah, I mean, it's just a matter of cranking out the
00:23:22 functions that I know and need to be in there. Programming does become a little bit easier when
00:23:27 you finally just kind of accept it as a combination of problem solving and abstract thinking,
00:23:33 because you're not really dealing with a cup being filled with water. Make an object,
00:23:38 make an object, set up, set a flag, you know, have one object, you know, turn its flat set state
00:23:44 to weight, you know, change sprite, speak in timer, set timer flags, object instance destroy,
00:23:52 you know, create a different object, literally just got to take all the information of like an
00:23:57 object and just put it into a bunch of numbers and booleans and other buzzwords that I hate.
00:24:03 Boolean. Boolean. That's right. That's right. Booleans, more Booleans, please.
00:24:11 Yeah. Maybe a child Boolean. Yeah. Fucked up that RPG maker doesn't actually like make a
00:24:16 differentiation. It doesn't really make a difference. Oh my god, differentiate the
00:24:22 the difference between a variable and a switch because technically there is none.
00:24:25 Because a switch is just a Boolean and a Boolean is a variable. Whereas a variable in RPG maker
00:24:31 is an integer and that it makes it so confusing when translating it to actual programming.
00:24:37 Oh god. Yeah. Oh my god. Oh my god. What the fuck. All to make it hip and sick for the people who
00:24:46 don't understand. Like me. I can follow well enough. I know you sat excited to be talking about it,
00:24:56 so that's good enough for me. I love it. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so that's what I've been
00:25:05 that's what I've been doing. I've been making video games and waiting until COVID goes away
00:25:10 so I can go take promo pictures of the Blu-rays. Bleeming the wee Blu-rays. They're real. I actually
00:25:17 made them for years. For years. People be where's the Blu-rays? Trixie, where's the Blu-rays?
00:25:24 I paid you money for the Blu-rays. I gave $40 so I could buy the Blu-ray. I did it. I did it. I
00:25:32 made them. I made them. I made them real. I brought them out of the void into reality.
00:25:38 I have a big box of them. Wouldn't it be kind of funny if Trixie bought them all from you to give
00:25:45 to the people who paid her money? No. That's stupid. She would never do such a thing.
00:25:54 She would never do such a thing. That's what she ought to do. She ought to pay me. She ought to pay
00:26:00 me for satisfying her demand. If she gave me the plebe and the weeb money, then I would give the
00:26:10 copies for free to the people that already paid for the Kickstarter. But since I don't have that
00:26:15 money, I can't do that. I can't honor those people's purchases, even though I would like to,
00:26:21 because it would put me at a net loss. That's just not acceptable. You can't operate a business
00:26:28 in the negatives. That's true. Unless you have a name in some Jeffrey Bezos.
00:26:33 Sure. Or any number of tech startup geniuses.
00:26:40 Uber runs at a loss. YouTube is still running at a loss. That's pretty crazy.
00:26:45 Hasn't YouTube always run at a loss? It has. Not even all the YouTube red
00:26:51 subscriptions and stuff could salvage it. But it just keeps going.
00:26:55 And it needs storage. And it always will.
00:26:57 For all the weird stuff people put on YouTube.
00:27:00 It needs to exist, so it must. It simply has to exist, no matter of the cost.
00:27:07 I have a story. I have a funny story from the My Little Pony days. I'm a horror story, if you
00:27:13 will. So in 2014, I used to be a part of a bunch of... Back when everyone had their Skype groups
00:27:21 that everyone was adding each other to for projects, like, oh, we're going to read a fan
00:27:26 fiction and we need voice actors. We're going to make a little My Little Pony fan animation,
00:27:30 whatever. And they just get your friends to make you join or whatever the fuck.
00:27:35 Like you do. Like you do.
00:27:36 Yeah. There was one project called Journey of the Spark that had a bit of traction.
00:27:43 These guys were like, hey, let's make an entire movie. An entire movie made by the fans.
00:27:49 And they had this trailer. And the animation was sort of half okay.
00:27:53 Have I heard about this?
00:27:55 Possibly. Journey of the Spark, maybe.
00:27:58 Sounds familiar.
00:27:59 Journey of the Spark. It sort of rings a bell.
00:28:02 They got panels at conventions several times. I can post some of the posters and promo images.
00:28:08 Maybe you'll recognize one. Let's see. There's that one.
00:28:13 Oh, I do remember this. Let me see here. Oh, wow. Look at that background.
00:28:21 So this was a project I'd heard of for a while. I got invited onto it when
00:28:25 the director of the project auditioned for one of my projects I was running with my partner.
00:28:31 And them, sorry, they've transitioned since. So like all my memories are with male pronouns.
00:28:38 So I'm going to try my best to use female pronouns. I apologize in advance if I mess up.
00:28:43 She was talking to my partner. I guess my partner's also transitioned since then.
00:28:49 And like opposite directions. Whoa. Anyways.
00:28:52 Wait, somebody else did too?
00:28:55 All right. My partner was identified as female back then and is now male.
00:29:00 And for this person, it's the other way around. And I just find that funny.
00:29:04 It's the nature of my little party.
00:29:05 Wait, one of the producers?
00:29:08 Yeah. The person whose last name was right now or something.
00:29:14 So anyway, they were like the person.
00:29:16 What's their name now?
00:29:18 The name now is a spoiler. It's funny and you'll find out why later.
00:29:23 ContraPoints.
00:29:30 Natalie Win, producer of Journey of the Spark.
00:29:33 That would be fucking funny as fuck dude.
00:29:36 No.
00:29:37 So Journey of the Spark had, like I'd heard of it. I'd seen the trailers.
00:29:40 They got a lot of views. I knew they had panels at conventions.
00:29:43 And the director, the person in charge of the whole project,
00:29:46 auditioned for our projects. We spoke to them and they invited us on.
00:29:50 And when we joined the Skype group, immediately there's a red flag.
00:29:54 Because as we're joining, we're seeing like 20 people leave
00:29:58 and a couple of them are being like, hey, just warning you,
00:30:01 you're going to have a bad time. Get out where you can.
00:30:05 And then like dropping out of the chat.
00:30:06 Wow. So this is you like basically like asking, like,
00:30:10 can I be involved in this project? And a bunch of people involved in the project
00:30:14 are like, don't make the same mistake I did.
00:30:17 You're walking into a burning building.
00:30:19 Yeah. Like, and the second we got in the server,
00:30:22 like half the people were like in the process of leaving,
00:30:25 like within like that hour, pretty much.
00:30:28 And we didn't really find out what happened.
00:30:30 The old head of animation was a guy called Jan.
00:30:33 I don't know if it was Jan animations.
00:30:36 I was going to say as in Jan animations.
00:30:39 I mean, possibly I never got it confirmed.
00:30:41 Someone said that it was, but I don't know if they were correct.
00:30:46 Reena Chan, also Kara Buckland, was also involved in the project at a time.
00:30:51 Who's Reena Chan?
00:30:53 She was fat.
00:30:54 The voice actor, right?
00:30:55 She was a voice actor.
00:30:56 She voiced in a lot of old Newgrounds animations.
00:30:58 Did you say she was fat?
00:31:02 Is that the first thing that comes to mind?
00:31:05 She's not fat. I don't think I said that.
00:31:08 Sorry, my voice.
00:31:09 I am having a...
00:31:10 He said that I said PHH as in sick.
00:31:14 We swear.
00:31:15 I thought that was what you said, but I may have misheard.
00:31:18 I don't even know what I said.
00:31:19 I can't raise my voice because my voice like literally goes on mute like in a real life.
00:31:24 If I shout, my voice just goes...
00:31:26 But that's a voice actress, right?
00:31:28 Yeah, Reena Chan.
00:31:29 Oh, oh, oh, Reena Chan is Kara Buckland.
00:31:32 Is Kara Buckland, yeah.
00:31:34 She's popular now because she voiced to be in the English dub of Nier,
00:31:39 which is trash, play the game in Japanese.
00:31:42 But yeah, what was I saying?
00:31:45 So, you know, the project had some notable names in it.
00:31:47 Some of these people, like bigger names, hadn't left.
00:31:50 So we had some faith in the project.
00:31:52 And the director was very friendly with my partner.
00:31:56 And they had a lot of calls together.
00:32:00 And we quickly found out that the lead voice actress for Twilight Sparkle,
00:32:06 I believe her name was Meredith Sims.
00:32:08 I think she voiced some characters for Silly Philly Studios.
00:32:11 I think she was the voice of Snowdrop maybe in the Snowdrop animation.
00:32:14 I don't remember too clearly.
00:32:17 Who could forget Snowdrop?
00:32:18 Legendary, legendary short.
00:32:20 Snow Blind.
00:32:23 Snow, Snow Blind, yeah.
00:32:27 Oh, shit, what was I saying?
00:32:28 So apparently the director had been having some issues with Meredith's, I guess, acting ability.
00:32:36 Because they were recording some lines for a trailer.
00:32:38 They wanted to debut at a convention.
00:32:41 And there were some scenes where Twilight had to be crying.
00:32:44 And just didn't feel the emotion was coming across.
00:32:46 She couldn't do it.
00:32:48 Like, obviously she could do it.
00:32:49 But just didn't think the emotions felt genuine enough, you know?
00:32:52 Which is always like the biggest thing the voice acting is.
00:32:55 Everyone thinks they can do a good impression.
00:32:56 I guess that's the director's job is to get the right performance out of their actors.
00:33:01 They brought my partner on to be the voice director specifically.
00:33:05 So they're like the head of project.
00:33:06 And my partner was going to be working with them as the voice director,
00:33:09 giving direction to the voice actors and working with them.
00:33:12 Oh.
00:33:12 So that was what my partner's job was going to be.
00:33:14 Was this a paid gig, by the way?
00:33:16 No.
00:33:16 Or was it just a fan?
00:33:17 Nothing, nothing.
00:33:18 It's cost, cost, okay, okay.
00:33:20 This was a pony community.
00:33:22 No one got paid for anything back then.
00:33:24 Okay, okay, I understand.
00:33:27 Which every time people make fun of KP for not paying people,
00:33:30 I'm like, dude, it's a fucking pony community.
00:33:32 No one gets paid ever.
00:33:33 Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody got paid.
00:33:35 Yeah.
00:33:36 But anyway, so that's fair.
00:33:39 So yeah, the director was to my partner.
00:33:42 Oh, hey, why don't you record some sample lines for them to reference?
00:33:46 So my partner did.
00:33:48 And my partner also had a pretty decent Twilight Sparkle impression.
00:33:51 My partner was pretty decent at acting.
00:33:54 So they did that.
00:33:55 And the director was like, oh, oh my God, your Twilight voice is actually really good.
00:34:02 It's actually really good.
00:34:04 Like, ah.
00:34:05 Oh no.
00:34:05 You know, originally when we started the project, I got Meredith on board,
00:34:09 you know, back before I really had, before I really had a team.
00:34:13 She was just a friend I had.
00:34:14 And, you know, I brought her on board because, you know.
00:34:17 And now she's just, now she's just a dead weight anchor around my ankle,
00:34:21 weighing us down, dragging us down.
00:34:23 This project is done.
00:34:24 But now, now this project has scope and we're gonna make this.
00:34:28 And now that this project has scope and potential and, you know,
00:34:32 we can make this first fan animated movie, something that's never been achieved before.
00:34:36 You know, it was two hour feature length like Disney quality film that us unpaid
00:34:40 Bronies are totally going to be able to make.
00:34:43 Totally.
00:34:44 It'll definitely happen.
00:34:44 That's right.
00:34:46 All it takes is grit and gumption and elbow grease and a lot of, and love of the, of the
00:34:52 source material.
00:34:53 You know, maybe exactly.
00:34:55 All it takes is passion.
00:34:56 Yeah.
00:34:57 Maybe it'll be worth like having you takeovers when you twilight,
00:35:00 you know, sparkle voice actor for this project.
00:35:03 And my partner's like, oh, me?
00:35:06 This is a, this is a, this is a what's not, not a, not a my fair lady moment.
00:35:11 It's like a, like a, like a, I don't know.
00:35:14 What's a movie where it's like a Cinderella moment.
00:35:17 Like, oh, the shoe fits, the shoe fits better.
00:35:22 Right.
00:35:22 So the, the funny undertone of this is like the surface reading is, oh,
00:35:26 they just thought the voice was better.
00:35:28 And they had also hinted a lot that they had a crush on the old Twilight voice actor at the time.
00:35:36 And they at some point confessed that they were crushing on my partner as well.
00:35:42 And like, they just have a thing for any, anyone who happens to be voicing Twilight.
00:35:48 That's the impression I get.
00:35:50 So like, it's, it's funny.
00:35:53 All right. So this is a very, I'm glad, I'm glad everyone's a professional in this.
00:35:56 I'm glad everyone's a professional.
00:35:57 Stupid scenario.
00:35:58 So it's like, they, they, they, they like confess a lot of things.
00:36:02 They, they told my partner about the inflation porn.
00:36:04 They're like, they really liked a blueberry inflation porn.
00:36:07 Um, that was like a big thing for them.
00:36:09 What is it?
00:36:10 What is it with these people and inflation?
00:36:14 You know, they just watched Willy Wonka and it just had an effect on them.
00:36:17 You know, they got, they got to have that blueberry inflation.
00:36:21 It's, it's, it's part of the balanced breakfast.
00:36:23 Everyone has a moment in their childhood where they see some weird shit that they really like.
00:36:28 And that was theirs, you know.
00:36:30 Wait, what the fuck?
00:36:30 There's a fucking blueberry inflation Funko Pop.
00:36:33 Hold on.
00:36:34 What?
00:36:35 Hold on.
00:36:35 What the fuck?
00:36:36 Oh no.
00:36:37 What the fuck?
00:36:38 Yeah, that sounds, that sounds about right.
00:36:42 That's fucking stupid.
00:36:44 That's hilarious.
00:36:45 Why is that?
00:36:45 What was that shit?
00:36:46 I, I, I am, hold on.
00:36:48 Hostessly.
00:36:48 It's slight distraction.
00:36:50 We got to see it.
00:36:51 There you go.
00:36:52 Oh my God.
00:36:54 Violet Beauregard.
00:36:55 Violet Beauregard.
00:36:56 Amazing.
00:36:57 Violet Beauregard.
00:36:58 It's how tragic that this is the Violet Beauregard Funko Pop.
00:37:03 Like this isn't what she normally looks like.
00:37:05 This is her with like a medical condition.
00:37:08 And it's, we caught a shiny, we caught a shiny variant.
00:37:12 Yeah.
00:37:13 Yeah.
00:37:13 Well.
00:37:14 Yeah.
00:37:15 Anyways, so this was going on.
00:37:17 And eventually the director went to Meredith and,
00:37:20 and told them that they wanted to replace her.
00:37:24 And when they did, they suddenly were like,
00:37:26 yeah, this new voice directors, they're really pushy
00:37:29 and they're manipulating me and they said they don't like you
00:37:32 and they want you off the project.
00:37:33 And I just have no choice.
00:37:34 Like they just made up all this bullshit
00:37:36 because they didn't want to hurt their friends feelings.
00:37:38 They wanted to shift blame.
00:37:39 And I know this is a case because they immediately messaged my partner and said,
00:37:42 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
00:37:43 I said all these things that weren't true.
00:37:45 If you're going to lie, if you're going to lie,
00:37:48 why not just stick to your fucking story?
00:37:51 Why not just lie then?
00:37:54 Just, I don't know.
00:37:56 And then Meredith, who had a lot of connections, told everyone,
00:37:59 oh, yeah, watch out for oblivion's partner,
00:38:02 very manipulator and all this shit.
00:38:03 And I had a bunch of like big people.
00:38:05 That's true.
00:38:06 Including Rob Bob, who.
00:38:07 I heard, I heard from a guy that that's true.
00:38:10 Yeah, I had.
00:38:12 I heard from the director.
00:38:14 The director of Journey of the Spark, the famous director.
00:38:17 My friend, my friend, E ride an hour.
00:38:25 Careful.
00:38:25 A.K.A. Natalie Wynn.
00:38:29 I was going to say, don't be dead naming now.
00:38:32 So anyway, I don't close enough, a dead initialing, maybe.
00:38:38 Their new name is not E.
00:38:40 Actually, no, it was for a while.
00:38:42 They were Erica and then they changed to something else
00:38:44 that I'll get to.
00:38:46 So they said that and we were really upset.
00:38:48 Like, why are you doing this?
00:38:49 Like, now my partner's reputation is in trouble
00:38:52 and I had to try and do damage control.
00:38:54 The guy Rob Bob I mentioned was like,
00:38:56 he had huge industry connections.
00:38:58 He got Gray Delisle to voice in an animation project
00:39:00 that we were working on once.
00:39:02 Gray Delisle?
00:39:04 Gray Delisle.
00:39:05 She's voiced about as many or more characters
00:39:09 than Tara Strong, including like Frankie Foster
00:39:12 from Foster's Imaginary, whatever the fuck.
00:39:16 Azula from Avatar.
00:39:18 She's the voice of Azula.
00:39:19 Oh, wait.
00:39:21 Okay.
00:39:21 What's what's your name?
00:39:22 Okay.
00:39:22 Gray Delisle.
00:39:23 The Azula Jeth.
00:39:24 Yeah.
00:39:24 Great.
00:39:25 Yeah.
00:39:25 Gray Delisle is like super legit.
00:39:27 I'll just link her wiki page.
00:39:30 Oh, sure.
00:39:32 Okay.
00:39:32 Okay.
00:39:33 But yeah, so the guy who had connections to like her
00:39:36 was even like caring about it.
00:39:37 And so that was like, that really bothered me.
00:39:40 I was really like, okay.
00:39:44 So I was having to do damage control on that level.
00:39:46 And so I was really pissed at the director at this point.
00:39:49 And then we realized that like we found out
00:39:52 from other people who left the project
00:39:54 that this is like a repeating cycle
00:39:56 and that that was actually the second way if you left.
00:39:58 There was one even before that.
00:40:00 And so we were like, oh, and then things were
00:40:02 really sour with the director from then on.
00:40:05 And after like a few weeks, I was supposed to help
00:40:07 with the trailer, but I was just like,
00:40:09 I don't want to work for this person anymore.
00:40:11 I mean, my partner at a certain point
00:40:12 was just like, yeah, now we're leaving and we dropped out.
00:40:15 And then the project kept going.
00:40:17 Half the team dropped out with us.
00:40:18 And then a new team was brought on,
00:40:20 including a friend of mine, my friend Phoenix.
00:40:23 And then they kept going around to conventions
00:40:25 for about a year afterwards.
00:40:27 And at a certain point I was realizing like,
00:40:29 Hasbro's got to send them a cease and desist at some point.
00:40:34 For one, like after a year,
00:40:35 if I couldn't even get a trailer done,
00:40:36 they think they can get like an over two hour long like a movie.
00:40:40 Oh, that's bad.
00:40:41 That's bad.
00:40:42 Yeah.
00:40:43 And they think animators,
00:40:45 including people who I'm friends with,
00:40:47 I believe in this project and are throwing away their like labor
00:40:51 for someone who isn't paying them
00:40:53 for a project that'll never even come out.
00:40:56 Because it's guaranteed to never be finished.
00:40:58 Or I mean, if it gets close enough to being finished,
00:41:01 Hasbro's not going to let you make a fucking movie.
00:41:04 Jesus Christ.
00:41:05 Yeah.
00:41:05 So I was like, I am going to message Hasbro.
00:41:14 I still had access to all the drop boxes.
00:41:15 I still had access to all the information.
00:41:18 I downloaded a lot of it, checked over the script,
00:41:20 checked over some of the details.
00:41:22 And I sent Hasbro, I found their contact,
00:41:25 their legal contact.
00:41:26 And I sent them a message because in my mind,
00:41:30 I'm like, this project is doomed anyway.
00:41:32 I am just freeing these animators early
00:41:33 so that they can actually focus on things
00:41:35 that'll actually come to fruition.
00:41:39 I'm doing the right thing.
00:41:39 Yeah.
00:41:40 I'm the good guy.
00:41:40 I'm the oblivion full breaker of chains.
00:41:43 Breaker of chains.
00:41:43 Wait, what so what information?
00:41:45 What information did you have access to in the drop boxes?
00:41:49 Basically just like the script and storyboard,
00:41:51 basically certain plot details,
00:41:53 including like Celestia dying and stuff,
00:41:56 which I messaged Hasbro.
00:41:58 I said, hey, just letting you know
00:41:59 there's this project being worked on.
00:42:01 Here's like some conventions where they showed it off.
00:42:03 You're a whistleblower.
00:42:05 I was a whistleblower.
00:42:06 And I explained some of its plot details
00:42:10 and in the story like Celestia dies
00:42:12 and there's all this dark stuff.
00:42:13 And I don't think that'll fit with your brand image
00:42:16 and all this, this and that.
00:42:18 And I left like a few paragraphs
00:42:19 and I linked to some videos and some things
00:42:21 so that they could have evidence
00:42:22 that this project was legit
00:42:25 or at least it was taking itself pretty legit.
00:42:26 Who did you contact at Hasbro?
00:42:29 I just contacted, I just Googled Hasbro legal or something.
00:42:32 Like customer service?
00:42:33 Or customer service or something.
00:42:35 I don't remember what, this was like mid 2014 at this point.
00:42:38 So this was like seven years ago.
00:42:41 And I got an email back like that day
00:42:44 and I wish I still had it.
00:42:46 Oh my God, I wish I fucking had this email.
00:42:49 It was amazing.
00:42:51 If I can paraphrase, it was something to be effect of,
00:42:54 hi, thank you for giving us this information.
00:42:57 We take this very seriously.
00:42:59 Intellectual property theft is no joke.
00:43:01 And we will take swift legal action at the appropriate time.
00:43:06 Have a smiley day.
00:43:10 So what you're saying is that the director
00:43:13 was absolutely correct.
00:43:15 You are a backstabber.
00:43:16 Yes, well, at this point, I mean they said I was in the back.
00:43:20 We're a back re-stabber.
00:43:22 We're just putting, we're just giving the knife actor
00:43:25 it's rightful owner.
00:43:26 Hey, it's like you stab my back.
00:43:29 I stab yours, buddy.
00:43:30 You know, we can help each other out.
00:43:32 We help each other to die.
00:43:34 Yes.
00:43:35 Two weeks later on their Tumblr.
00:43:37 Hey guys, we got a cease and desist,
00:43:40 but we're not giving up hope.
00:43:41 And I'm like, okay, okay.
00:43:42 Oh boy.
00:43:45 But the project basically never had legs after that ever again.
00:43:48 And the animator friends I had on there did leave
00:43:50 and did go on to better things and good for them.
00:43:54 How much, so how much was, okay, how long had it been going on
00:43:59 and how much was done by that point?
00:44:02 I think like, from what they told us,
00:44:04 they had started working on it like early 2012,
00:44:08 like maybe like in the scripting stage,
00:44:09 like very beginning of 2012, they had the idea.
00:44:11 So it had been going for a year plus, maybe almost two years.
00:44:14 Well, this is like mid 2014.
00:44:16 So it was a bit over two years at this point,
00:44:18 maybe two and a half years of production and like going for
00:44:22 like three or four different teams worth of people.
00:44:25 But so the project never really had legs again,
00:44:27 but the director sort of stuck around and sort of like,
00:44:30 I posted about it for a while and that's,
00:44:32 and like checking up on their Tumblr to see like how it was going.
00:44:35 That's when we learned about the transition.
00:44:37 They changed her name to Erica at first.
00:44:40 And then a little while later, if you change her name to something else,
00:44:45 your name now is Violet.
00:44:51 I'm just looking at that Funko Pop.
00:44:57 That explains a lot.
00:45:00 That's funny.
00:45:01 She's just really exiting guys, I swear.
00:45:04 She just really likes your name.
00:45:06 That's pretty humorous.
00:45:07 The name just speaks to me, you know?
00:45:09 Like it's a chuckle out of me.
00:45:10 Yeah.
00:45:12 Yeah, fascinating.
00:45:14 Well, that was a journey of the spark.
00:45:18 You were taking me on that journey with you.
00:45:19 That journey of the spark, yeah.
00:45:21 Of the spark, all right, all right, yeah, of course.
00:45:28 That fan of had a lot of shit going about it.
00:45:30 Oh yeah, there's a number one that's pretty good actually,
00:45:34 that Faye can comment on.
00:45:36 So I don't know, actually, no, of course you remember,
00:45:39 you were a fucking My Little Pony analyst.
00:45:41 You probably talked about this character on T-Bap.
00:45:44 Do you remember this wheelchair pony from Tradia?
00:45:48 Yes, the purple and brown guy, yeah.
00:45:51 The Make-A-Wish guy.
00:45:53 Yeah, with the steampunk wheels.
00:45:57 Yeah, I remember this guy standing out to me
00:46:00 when I first saw the episode.
00:46:01 I'm like, this guy's weird and some YouTube comments were like,
00:46:03 oh, it's a Make-A-Wish kid.
00:46:05 He got a Make-A-Wish to be in the show.
00:46:06 And I'm like, oh, that's cool or whatever.
00:46:09 A few months afterwards, I got messaged by a friend on Facebook,
00:46:13 someone who is not a brony.
00:46:15 So in no relation to it, he'd sent me a Tumblr post saying,
00:46:18 oh my God, these bronies are sick.
00:46:22 Did you know that there was a Make-A-Wish kid in My Little Pony?
00:46:25 And they drew porn.
00:46:27 They drew hundreds of porn images of this child in My Little Pony.
00:46:33 Bronies, oh, they're so sick and twisted.
00:46:36 How dare they do this?
00:46:37 They're all fucked up.
00:46:39 And I was like, oh, let me check Derpy Breeru,
00:46:43 see how many images there actually are.
00:46:45 And there was less than 20 after many months.
00:46:48 And I'm like, that's nothing.
00:46:51 I told my friend, there's not really that many images.
00:46:53 And it looks like it's just two artists.
00:46:55 So I don't think it's that widespread of a problem.
00:46:58 So it seems like a valid reason to be concerned.
00:47:02 What I didn't know at the time, because I didn't know him yet,
00:47:06 the artist responsible was Four Eyes.
00:47:15 Well, Four Eyes, what do you have to say for yourself?
00:47:18 I'd do it again.
00:47:19 And I did.
00:47:21 What's your, well, officer, he says he'd do it again.
00:47:27 And we can't arrest him if he's not sorry.
00:47:29 I'm guilty, but it's fine.
00:47:31 It's fine, he wasn't actually a minor.
00:47:34 The kid wasn't actually a minor.
00:47:36 It's fine.
00:47:37 Yeah, yeah.
00:47:37 Oh, is that true?
00:47:38 Yeah, this Make-A-Wish kid was 18, first of all.
00:47:41 Faye, you tell the story to me or you actually talk to him.
00:47:44 Yeah, the whole scandal happened.
00:47:47 And as far as I know, nobody even knew that it was me that did it.
00:47:50 People just kind of saw that like me and like one other person
00:47:53 like did some vaguely not-safe work images and just labeled it all as bronies.
00:48:01 And I think during the whole scandal, the person was not present.
00:48:07 The guy behind the OC was not present at all.
00:48:10 But his mother was commenting on Derpy Boo, sending
00:48:14 asks to people on Tumblr saying, this is destroying my son's life.
00:48:17 He's ruining his reputation.
00:48:19 He's crying.
00:48:20 He's dying.
00:48:22 He's from Make-A-Wish, he's dying.
00:48:24 He literally was dying, right?
00:48:27 Sort of.
00:48:28 Is he alive?
00:48:29 He's still alive.
00:48:30 Yes, because about a few months after the whole thing settled down,
00:48:35 the guy specifically came to me on DeviantArt.
00:48:38 He gave me a private message on DeviantArt saying,
00:48:41 hey, I'm sorry for the way my mother was acting.
00:48:44 I'm actually over 18.
00:48:47 I really actually enjoy all the fan art that I've been getting of my character.
00:48:52 And I'm horny as fuck.
00:48:56 They apparently are completely fine with it
00:49:00 and have commissioned plenty of artworks off their character in NSFW situations.
00:49:05 Getting fucked in the ass by Discord.
00:49:08 No, that was just me.
00:49:10 They paid people to draw him fucking fore-eyes.
00:49:14 Yeah, that was what he paid one artist to draw as a gift back like,
00:49:19 hey, here's my character having sex with your character.
00:49:22 It's like, oh, thanks.
00:49:25 I'm glad there was a happy ending forever.
00:49:29 Happy ending.
00:49:30 He was okay with it and he didn't even die.
00:49:33 He didn't even die.
00:49:34 I don't know how much I can share.
00:49:36 I don't know how much I can share his illness.
00:49:37 I hope he's not listening.
00:49:38 This is going to sound...
00:49:39 I mean, it's fine.
00:49:40 Wait, what?
00:49:41 I think he's fine with it.
00:49:42 You don't know if he can share his illness?
00:49:44 I can't really share the details of it,
00:49:46 because one, I haven't really asked him much about it,
00:49:49 but he's talked about it sometimes.
00:49:51 I don't know.
00:49:51 I just thought that if you're a make-a-wish kid, it means you're going to die soon.
00:49:58 It's a...
00:49:58 So, you know, I was expecting...
00:50:00 I was, you know, I was hoping for a death.
00:50:08 They ripped me off.
00:50:10 My little pony told me that kid was going to die, damn it.
00:50:13 Well, I mean, he still has something.
00:50:15 I mean, it's been like years.
00:50:17 It's been years since that episode.
00:50:19 Like, guy, come on, like, clock's ticking.
00:50:21 Like, how many...
00:50:22 Like, are you going to keep us waiting for, like, how much longer here?
00:50:25 I can at least say it's not...
00:50:26 It is life-threatening, just not immediately.
00:50:28 It's something about how he'll only get worse and worse with age,
00:50:31 until he's basically incapable of handling himself.
00:50:34 So, while he is still capable of handling himself, he got a make-a-wish.
00:50:37 I'm...
00:50:38 I'm sorry to be so grim about it.
00:50:42 It's absolutely fine.
00:50:44 I'm pretty sure he's fine with it.
00:50:45 I don't actually want...
00:50:46 I don't actually want this kid to die.
00:50:49 I mean, he's happy.
00:50:50 He's like...
00:50:50 He's still making art.
00:50:51 He actually makes his own art.
00:50:52 Well, good.
00:50:53 Oh, good for him.
00:50:54 Very funny.
00:50:55 Yeah, I remember people commenting on the...
00:50:59 You know, the character is just...
00:51:00 It's just a little bit OC-looking, even before the kind of notable steampunk wheelchair,
00:51:08 which is a bit funny.
00:51:09 The colors are just a bit too dark, you know?
00:51:11 People make fun of...
00:51:12 The what?
00:51:12 The colors of his...
00:51:13 The color palette of his OC is just a little bit too not pastel, basically.
00:51:19 Yeah, yeah, a little bit too...
00:51:21 It looks like a fan character.
00:51:24 Yeah.
00:51:25 You know, I guess the steampunk wheelchair, you know, maybe that's like...
00:51:31 Maybe that's not fair.
00:51:32 Like, I mean, I guess it does kind of look like...
00:51:35 What do you call it?
00:51:36 I mean, they're more like training wheels.
00:51:38 A little bit, yeah.
00:51:38 Right, it's like the thing that you give like a dog that legs don't work, right?
00:51:43 Well, he is a horse.
00:51:45 Maybe it's supposed to resemble like a cantorlot, you know,
00:51:49 cantorlot architecture, which it kind of does.
00:51:52 I mean, in plenty of the images I've seen of his character that he's commissioned,
00:51:56 he's always in pretty fancy bedrooms, so maybe.
00:52:01 Well...
00:52:01 This is my game theory.
00:52:04 Thanks, Matt Pat.
00:52:05 Where would we be without you and your porn theories?
00:52:08 My knowledge of the dark side.
00:52:11 I'm barely even there anymore.
00:52:12 I'm a pretty shallow consumer of this stuff nowadays.
00:52:17 All right, all right.
00:52:19 That's fine, you know, whatever.
00:52:22 Very wax, very weird.
00:52:24 I'm actually kind of glad to know that the kid didn't die.
00:52:28 Yeah.
00:52:29 Yet.
00:52:30 That's kind of nice.
00:52:31 That's a bit heartwarming.
00:52:33 He's still doing good.
00:52:34 We'll all die eventually, Ben.
00:52:36 It's okay.
00:52:37 Yeah, we'll get him.
00:52:38 We all say to get your blood less yet.
00:52:44 So...
00:52:45 So...
00:52:49 Yeah, I don't know.
00:52:50 Tell me more.
00:52:51 Tell me more stories.
00:52:53 I got nothing else to talk about.
00:52:55 Uneventful week.
00:52:57 Uneventful week for me.
00:52:59 I mean, I've just been fucking sick too.
00:53:01 I would have had my animation that I've been working on for months out by the end of the year,
00:53:07 except that I got sick.
00:53:08 Don't know if it's COVID.
00:53:09 We can't seem to find a test where we're at.
00:53:13 Yeah.
00:53:14 I mean, even before that work was...
00:53:16 I was amazed that I could find some in CVS.
00:53:19 I was shocked that they had some available.
00:53:21 But they're out now.
00:53:22 I went the other day and I asked again and they're like,
00:53:24 nope, we're out.
00:53:25 And so I'm...
00:53:26 Yeah, all the places around here seem to be out.
00:53:29 But it kind of ruined all my plans.
00:53:31 Like, I was fine on Christmas, but like by...
00:53:34 No kidding.
00:53:35 That night, like when I woke up the day after Christmas,
00:53:37 I was just, there was a boulder in my throat.
00:53:39 I felt like it was...
00:53:40 Oh, so you definitely, so you definitely spread it.
00:53:43 You definitely were being a super spreader.
00:53:45 No, I wasn't leaving the house.
00:53:47 Our roommate who works at a movie theater brought it home
00:53:51 and gave it to all of us who sit indoors all day.
00:53:54 Oh, okay.
00:53:55 It was his Christmas present to you.
00:53:58 Yeah, I didn't go out for Christmas.
00:54:01 Okay.
00:54:01 But yeah, and that kind of...
00:54:04 I was bedridden for a while and my voice is all fucked up.
00:54:06 If I try to raise my voice, it just cuts out.
00:54:09 And I'm really worried that people aren't going to understand
00:54:11 what I'm saying sometimes because my voice just keeps going.
00:54:14 When I speak.
00:54:15 But um, oh God.
00:54:17 That was a hard cut off.
00:54:19 Yeah, I...
00:54:21 When I was able to at least not be in absolute pain and agony,
00:54:25 I've been drawing a bit, I've been working on music,
00:54:27 but not my main project because I already realized
00:54:30 I'm not a misfit deadline.
00:54:31 Did you have a fever?
00:54:32 I had a fucking bad fever.
00:54:34 I couldn't even sleep.
00:54:35 I was so, it was so hot.
00:54:37 I was all around six hours one night.
00:54:40 That was my experience.
00:54:42 That was the only thing that really was bad.
00:54:46 I didn't cough that much.
00:54:48 Didn't have much of a runny nose or anything.
00:54:51 Not my first.
00:54:52 There was a fever and the chills and I couldn't lay down.
00:54:56 I didn't get headaches, but I couldn't lie down
00:54:59 without sweating profusely.
00:55:01 And then I'd sit up and I'd feel cold and I'd be shivering.
00:55:05 And I'd be like, I can't tell how hot it is.
00:55:09 I can't tell what temperature it is in this room.
00:55:12 Am I just imagining the cold or is it real?
00:55:15 Yeah, that's what my partner's been going through.
00:55:17 They have it really bad.
00:55:18 I'll feel them.
00:55:19 I feel like he's blasting off their skin like a fucking oven
00:55:22 and they tell me that they're freezing cold.
00:55:24 And I'm like, no, you're not getting the extra blanket.
00:55:27 I'm sorry.
00:55:29 Even though they think they're shivering.
00:55:31 I experienced that a little bit.
00:55:33 My partner's immune system's a lot worse than mine though.
00:55:35 I've been taking care of them because
00:55:36 they caught it slightly later than me.
00:55:39 But yeah, we think it's COVID.
00:55:41 Like we've spoken to our other friends who caught it recently
00:55:43 and they've all described pretty much the same thing.
00:55:47 And yeah, that's probably what's happened.
00:55:50 We don't have our booster.
00:55:51 We're not eligible for a couple more weeks
00:55:53 because it hasn't been six months yet.
00:55:56 I don't think, I don't know if it makes that much of a difference.
00:55:58 Maybe it does.
00:56:01 Omicron though.
00:56:01 Omicron doesn't give a fuck.
00:56:03 I mean, it does a little bit.
00:56:04 It might be Omicron for all I know.
00:56:07 I caught regular COVID in early like 2020
00:56:10 and it was a little bit different.
00:56:12 I guess it depends.
00:56:13 Omicron might not be dominant everywhere yet,
00:56:16 but it probably will be soon.
00:56:19 If it is, I will have had COVID twice in my life.
00:56:21 So, woof.
00:56:24 Iki, icky, icky, icky sticky.
00:56:27 Iki, icky, no, thank you.
00:56:30 I mean, I guess if we don't have a lot of things to talk about,
00:56:33 we could go to that voicemail thing
00:56:36 because there's going to be a lot of discussion
00:56:38 to happen afterwards.
00:56:39 Oh, yeah, sure.
00:56:40 I mean, yeah, why not?
00:56:42 Why not just get the ball rolling on that, I guess.
00:56:45 Oh, yeah.
00:56:47 Do you want to post it?
00:56:48 All right.
00:56:48 Dropping voicemail finale in...
00:56:52 Oh, it's taken a bit.
00:56:55 It's a bit long.
00:56:56 It's like horseshoe finale.
00:56:58 We're going to be here for several hours.
00:57:00 There's a lot of loose threads.
00:57:02 Horseshoe finale.
00:57:04 Horseshoe finale.
00:57:05 Jesse Wood, plebe and the weeb.
00:57:07 Plebe and the weeb blue rays available now.
00:57:09 Send me money.
00:57:10 Send me PayPal, me $30 plus shipping.
00:57:13 Get a fucking DVD.
00:57:14 Wow, can you fucking believe physical media still exists?
00:57:18 I can't.
00:57:20 Fred, how much will shipping be?
00:57:23 You're in Australia or some shit, right?
00:57:25 I am in Australia.
00:57:27 Or some shit.
00:57:28 Okay, now maybe something's changed.
00:57:31 After Christmas, the shipping has changed.
00:57:35 I know because my friend's sending me a computer part.
00:57:39 So it might be viable again.
00:57:41 America will...
00:57:43 The US post office will not ship just fucking ship to Australia.
00:57:48 Although it might have gone back to that.
00:57:49 But for a while there, it simply would not do it.
00:57:52 Shipping is $5 inside America.
00:57:56 $15 to other countries.
00:57:59 But Australia, New Zealand, I can't do it.
00:58:02 It's like $90.
00:58:04 It's like $90 to ship some...
00:58:06 What's a communist for America?
00:58:07 It's because...
00:58:09 Yeah, it's like the COVID lockdown something was like,
00:58:12 well, first class mail just doesn't go to Australia anymore.
00:58:15 You have to send it some other fucking way.
00:58:18 And it costs like a hundred bucks.
00:58:20 Yeah, maybe check a game soon, see if it's...
00:58:24 If someone...
00:58:26 Yeah, so I'm gonna...
00:58:27 Since you gave me that burner.
00:58:29 So I'll just give you one.
00:58:31 I'll just have to wait until that is no longer the case.
00:58:34 Yeah, it's okay.
00:58:35 I'm fine to pay for shipping.
00:58:36 That's like shipping to drag.
00:58:38 Yeah, I don't want to...
00:58:40 Yeah, but that's too much.
00:58:42 So if you're a listener and you're in Australia...
00:58:44 Sorry, but if you buy one, it will be $15.
00:58:48 And I will just wait until the shipping is normal.
00:58:51 And then I'll send it after it becomes normal.
00:58:53 Like whenever that happens.
00:58:55 Yeah.
00:58:58 And then we have $5 or $15 if you're out of the country.
00:59:02 Was it...
00:59:03 Wait, $5 shipping in America.
00:59:05 $15 to other countries.
00:59:07 Base price is $30, but if you are a Patreon...
00:59:10 If you are a Kickstarter...
00:59:12 $40 pleadingly Kickstarter backer, I will.
00:59:15 Purely out of the goodness of my heart, by the way.
00:59:17 Purely, this is pure charity.
00:59:19 I'll give you $20 off, right?
00:59:21 So if you were a backer in America,
00:59:24 it would cost you $15, including shipping.
00:59:27 Right?
00:59:27 That's how it works.
00:59:28 PayPal me at IASUcomic is my PayPal email address.
00:59:33 Send me the money.
00:59:34 Include your shipping address.
00:59:35 Patreon.com.
00:59:37 That's...
00:59:38 Oh, shit.
00:59:41 I've been hijacked.
00:59:42 All right, sorry.
00:59:43 Anyway, voicemail finale.
00:59:45 Oh god, it's four minutes.
00:59:48 There's no such thing as a voicemail
00:59:50 that could possibly justify it being four minutes long.
00:59:53 Look, no, it's fine, Ben.
00:59:54 That's what you think, Ben.
00:59:56 Just wait.
00:59:57 Just wait.
00:59:58 All right.
00:59:59 All right, let's do it.
01:00:01 Three, two, one, go.
01:00:05 I've done it.
01:00:07 I finally made it all the way back to this
01:00:11 miserable cum sock of a planet.
01:00:15 Earth.
01:00:17 Home of the PCP.
01:00:20 The elite cabal who banished me to the Twilight Realm.
01:00:26 Voice limbo.
01:00:30 I toppled the king from his throne
01:00:34 and bore this tape from his bone.
01:00:40 This is the final tape.
01:00:45 My swan song to you.
01:00:50 All right.
01:00:52 This tape will self-destruct.
01:00:55 What?
01:01:00 Oh boy.
01:01:01 It's happening now.
01:01:04 Oh.
01:01:05 Take a sip, babes.
01:01:09 Delicious.
01:01:13 First voicemail of the day in heck.
01:01:15 Ben St. didn't even bother to check.
01:01:17 Just how many of these voicemail suckers
01:01:19 want to be, want to be, league of nate fuckers?
01:01:49 Cook up a carb-filled savory plan.
01:01:51 Don't do keto or you'll be in strife.
01:01:53 Just take a bite and change your life.
01:01:56 Voice grail for life.
01:01:58 Voice grail for life.
01:02:00 I'm a fucking pile of snakes.
01:02:02 Voice grail for life.
01:02:04 Voice grail for life.
01:02:06 Oh well, nothing until I wipe cough,
01:02:08 wipe my grit and pull out my quark.
01:02:10 Aim for Michelle as I start to suck.
01:02:12 Oh my god, she's such a croc.
01:02:15 Voice grail for life.
01:02:17 Voice grail for life.
01:02:19 I am Ben St's worst nightmare.
01:02:21 I sure gave him quite a scare.
01:02:23 He wants to put me in the brig.
01:02:25 Cause I'm a fat, interrupting, non-specific farm animal.
01:02:31 Yeah.
01:02:32 Voice grail for life.
01:02:34 Voice grail for life.
01:02:36 This podcast has gone too long.
01:02:38 I will now complain in song.
01:02:40 If no nate, then I won't watch.
01:02:42 I'll just torture Ben St's crotch.
01:02:45 Voice grail for life.
01:02:47 Voice grail for life.
01:02:49 I've got a question here for Nate.
01:02:51 I'm sorry if this comes in late.
01:02:53 I just-
01:03:19 I hate this podcast.
01:03:28 I fucking hate it.
01:03:29 I can't do a single point
01:03:32 without literally every single host
01:03:34 constantly like vultures
01:03:37 trying to jump on me
01:03:38 and cannibalize my point.
01:03:40 Clear words unrecognized.
01:03:49 Okay, stopping.
01:03:56 And with that, my work is done.
01:04:02 Finally, my inner peace.
01:04:09 Oh god, it hurts.
01:04:12 Why do I put these things in my fucking face?
01:04:16 Pound of beef in the pan.
01:04:21 What seems to be the problem, man?
01:04:24 My tape.
01:04:28 No, so sad.
01:04:30 He got shot.
01:04:31 The gun, a recipe for death.
01:04:36 But there are more recipes to share in part two.
01:04:42 Oh god, there's more.
01:04:47 The second part's shorter, don't worry.
01:04:52 I feel like this is actually the finale
01:04:54 of all voicemails
01:04:55 and we can't have any more voicemails after this.
01:04:58 Like it's over.
01:05:00 It's almost over.
01:05:01 There's a few characters
01:05:02 who have yet to have conclusions.
01:05:04 But rest in peace, tapekeeper.
01:05:06 You will be missed.
01:05:07 Yeah, that's the tapekeeper.
01:05:09 Wait, from lesbian horse RPG.
01:05:13 Yeah.
01:05:14 Right?
01:05:15 Yeah.
01:05:15 Is this always, has this been the lore the whole time?
01:05:19 Yes.
01:05:19 Yes.
01:05:22 Okay.
01:05:24 Literally the best character in that game.
01:05:28 Well, yeah, I remember voicing this character
01:05:32 in TBAP plays.
01:05:35 I talked inward.
01:05:38 I did an inward voice breathing in voice like this.
01:05:41 Dude, I fucking love that let's play so much.
01:05:44 Oh god, my COVID.
01:05:45 Oh, that really activates my,
01:05:46 that really activates my,
01:05:50 that really activates my antigens.
01:05:53 That really gets my spike proteins.
01:05:56 Jocelyn, yeah, vibrating.
01:05:58 Oh boy.
01:05:59 Vibrating with motion.
01:06:01 Oh my god.
01:06:03 Well, Mal.
01:06:04 I recently watched like several reviews of that fucking game.
01:06:08 It's so fun to watch people rip into that.
01:06:11 Have you seen to Snaker's review?
01:06:13 I have not actually.
01:06:15 He was on the PCP a few weeks ago.
01:06:18 He has one of, I think his and his and Running Shine's
01:06:22 are my two favorite yick reviews.
01:06:26 Oh yeah.
01:06:28 In the crowded genre of YouTube yick reviews,
01:06:30 those two are head and shoulders.
01:06:33 In general, Running Shine is very entertaining.
01:06:36 I rewatch his stuff every now and then.
01:06:38 Pretty fun guy.
01:06:39 Sure, yeah, I like Running Shine.
01:06:42 I need to look up to Snaker's now.
01:06:44 I will absolutely watch him.
01:06:46 That's a good one.
01:06:47 Yes.
01:06:48 All right, voicemail finale revelations.
01:06:50 This is part two, I guess.
01:06:52 Are we ready?
01:06:53 Yes, I'm ready.
01:06:54 Are you ready?
01:06:56 Eleazar, cut that part out where I got, where it stopped.
01:06:59 We could just pretend that didn't happen.
01:07:01 Just, I'll be cutting it because I'll edit this episode.
01:07:04 Okay.
01:07:04 Yeah.
01:07:05 Pre Eleazar.
01:07:05 Oh wait, that's right.
01:07:06 You're editing this episode because Eleazar is gone.
01:07:10 He's on a trip for like a week, yeah.
01:07:12 He's on holiday.
01:07:12 Eleazar, beta.
01:07:14 Oh, good for him.
01:07:16 Anyway, that's the side of the point.
01:07:20 Voicemail finale.
01:07:21 Okay, three, two, one, go.
01:07:24 Apple seeds, buy the pound.
01:07:27 Crush them all the way.
01:07:30 Blend it well.
01:07:32 Almond smell.
01:07:34 Cheeseless.
01:07:34 Cyanine, sense you to hell.
01:07:37 Press for paste into a pill.
01:07:43 That's good kill.
01:07:49 I put the pill between my teeth.
01:07:55 Take a bite and you're live.
01:08:07 Rest in peace.
01:08:09 Press F.
01:08:10 Rest in peace.
01:08:12 Tito Kitchen.
01:08:14 What a fucking moron.
01:08:17 Imagine killing yourself.
01:08:20 Quinn.
01:08:23 Classic.
01:08:24 It appears I have a snake confession to make.
01:08:29 For four years I have slivered this planet.
01:08:34 Yet none know my true nature.
01:08:37 I have always identified as 28,980 snakes.
01:08:45 But in reality, I am simply one very lonely snake.
01:08:51 With 28,979 snitch-shaped tumors.
01:08:58 This begins.
01:09:00 The then snakes cancer arc.
01:09:05 Make a wish.
01:09:07 It's finally time that I unplug my voice filter.
01:09:12 My voice filter, which just so happens to be connected to my life's support system.
01:09:21 I will die.
01:09:23 But at least I can gaze upon Ben St.
01:09:28 with my lone eyes.
01:09:33 This ends.
01:09:35 The then snakes cancer arc.
01:09:39 Short but sweet.
01:09:42 Them snakes.
01:09:48 Oh, oh, there they are.
01:09:51 It would seem that I'm not dead yet.
01:09:56 Hello, hello.
01:09:58 Snakes, are you are you feeling all right after unplugging your life's support?
01:10:06 You do.
01:10:06 I may have been overdramatic.
01:10:11 This voice is really fucking hard to do when I have COVID.
01:10:14 What the fuck?
01:10:19 Jesus Christ.
01:10:20 Yeah, and cancer and damn COVID and cancer.
01:10:24 That's brutal.
01:10:25 I'm so sorry.
01:10:27 It's COVID.
01:10:28 Must be rough.
01:10:31 Three of your, well, one of you and two tumors, I guess, are here in the hall.
01:10:37 We're here for moral support.
01:10:39 Where the dearest, roundest, floppiest turn is a snake could ask for.
01:10:46 Oh boy.
01:10:46 I call them keto kitchen.
01:10:48 I'm in Cluster Punk Kitchen.
01:10:50 Yeah.
01:10:51 Cluster Punk Kitchen, yeah.
01:10:52 I was the keto man in Cluster Punk Kitchen.
01:10:55 Everyone's dead.
01:10:56 Everyone's dead.
01:10:56 Everywhere at the end of the PCP, all the voicemailers have all been, they're all dead.
01:11:02 They're all gone.
01:11:04 They've all gone to the great comet in the sky.
01:11:06 It's lonely.
01:11:08 So lonely at the top.
01:11:11 Tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down.
01:11:17 So, oh my god, them snakes, it was me all along.
01:11:22 It was me, Austin.
01:11:25 I know some people were very suspicious.
01:11:28 How could it be?
01:11:30 How could it be me?
01:11:32 How could it be?
01:11:35 Well, I fought.
01:11:37 I don't believe it.
01:11:38 I'm sorry.
01:11:39 This is an op.
01:11:40 Bandsynch.
01:11:41 This is me.
01:11:42 I believe it on the file.
01:11:44 I just, God, it's hard to do.
01:11:46 He doesn't have the voice filter.
01:11:47 I can't convince him.
01:11:48 Aha, them snakes would never cough.
01:11:51 Or have COVID.
01:11:53 Why did I have to be sick visually?
01:11:55 You imposter.
01:11:59 God.
01:12:01 Dude, recording that last of them snakes a bit was actually a nightmare.
01:12:04 So, when the voicemail's first fucking started, the first character I made was crunchy,
01:12:12 which was terrible and I had no ideas.
01:12:14 I don't even remember that.
01:12:16 The first voicemail, and it was on the very first episode.
01:12:18 I mean, that was their name or you're describing like their audio quality was crunchy.
01:12:23 Their name was crunchy.
01:12:24 They were like munchies dark side or whatever the fuck.
01:12:28 And the first voicemail, it's so bad.
01:12:31 It's just me going.
01:12:35 Like with like.
01:12:37 What a memorable character.
01:12:40 And the second time crunchy appeared, I did my impression of the undertayler
01:12:45 with again with voice filters and shit.
01:12:49 And I thought crunchy was a shit character and then I thought of them snakes.
01:12:52 Oh, Ben St. Vem snakes.
01:12:54 What if it's just a bunch of snakes and Ben doesn't like things that are
01:12:58 unoriginal or that are like sequels or whatever the fuck.
01:13:01 That was like a meme back then.
01:13:02 So.
01:13:03 Right.
01:13:04 Yeah.
01:13:04 Ha, Ben's the copycat.
01:13:05 That one episode with Jeff, where I was like, iteration is bad.
01:13:13 Yeah.
01:13:14 And Ben Ben St. V iteration of snakes, clearly.
01:13:18 Right.
01:13:19 So Ben bad.
01:13:20 That was that was the joke.
01:13:21 I was going to go all the way around.
01:13:22 I was going to do like analog woman, you know, for Digi bro.
01:13:26 I was going to do a bunch and then I just kind of was like, no, let's not do that.
01:13:30 And then I then I actually before the PCP editor contest even happened.
01:13:35 I got to go on as Vem snakes.
01:13:37 I fooled everyone managed to get myself in that was live.
01:13:43 That was before remember, remember the rap?
01:13:45 Remember that time I did the little animation for the rap?
01:13:49 Yeah.
01:13:49 Yeah.
01:13:49 That was fun.
01:13:50 Oh, yeah.
01:13:51 That was beautiful.
01:13:52 That was a beautiful moment.
01:13:54 I'm still proud of that.
01:13:55 I thought it was great.
01:13:56 It was really fucking great.
01:13:57 The editing on that episode was fucking crazy.
01:13:59 It being on there was surreal.
01:14:01 Yeah.
01:14:01 I worked really hard on it.
01:14:04 Yeah.
01:14:04 What?
01:14:05 So so I have two discords, obviously.
01:14:09 And I even have two Minecraft accounts.
01:14:11 I have a Minecraft account called Vem snakes.
01:14:12 I had I made a YouTube channel did all this stuff to keep up the deception.
01:14:16 The Vem snakes, Patreon page, all this shit to keep the deception running.
01:14:21 Wait, is there a Vem snakes?
01:14:24 Yeah.
01:14:24 Like in the very first voicemail is characterpatreon.com slash Vem snakes.
01:14:30 And then it says like, like, you know, like they Vem his pronouns, the plural they,
01:14:35 you know, the rare plural they, of course, of course.
01:14:39 Yeah.
01:14:40 It was and then fucking Gibbs suggested making it the black and red snakes from the game,
01:14:48 from the pump game.
01:14:49 And that was a great idea.
01:14:50 Right.
01:14:51 And I think there was fan art of that episode.
01:14:56 And four eyes.
01:14:58 Oh, yeah.
01:14:58 Do some Vem snakes fan art and even created Vem snakes mall.
01:15:02 There was actually a thing with that.
01:15:04 Oh, I remember.
01:15:05 I remember that.
01:15:05 I do remember that fan art.
01:15:07 That's specific one.
01:15:08 Yeah.
01:15:08 For sure.
01:15:08 I remember specifically I brought out that fan art and then somebody else who was also cold
01:15:13 four eyes also did fan art at Vem snakes.
01:15:16 Yeah.
01:15:16 Yes.
01:15:17 That was great.
01:15:17 There is another person named four eyes on Twitter who, yeah.
01:15:23 They are also like coincidence.
01:15:25 Pretty horny from what I've seen.
01:15:26 I thought you two were the same person for a while because like.
01:15:30 No, it's just fucking big coincidence.
01:15:32 I think it's a reasonable assumption.
01:15:34 But oh, yeah.
01:15:35 No, I just look in the shadows.
01:15:37 Yeah.
01:15:37 Okay.
01:15:38 Yeah.
01:15:42 Oh, yeah.
01:15:43 Where is that fan art though?
01:15:44 I want to put it in chat so we can show the screen.
01:15:45 Oh, let me.
01:15:47 Let me.
01:15:48 I think it was this one with the funny.
01:15:50 That was during that was during an era that was during an era in which I was putting in high
01:15:54 effort, high effort editing on the PCP.
01:15:57 That was the era of the Vem snakes rap battle and also that bonus episode with where we played
01:16:04 the Baron Munchausen.
01:16:08 Oh my God.
01:16:08 And I animated the battles.
01:16:10 Oh man.
01:16:10 That was a fun episode.
01:16:11 That one was way fun.
01:16:12 I thought that was great.
01:16:14 I never saw the video for Valley only.
01:16:15 I only saw I only got the audio frivos.
01:16:17 I just downloaded the audio for bonus episodes foolishly.
01:16:20 I should have grabbed the videos.
01:16:22 I don't even know where the playlist is.
01:16:24 Yeah.
01:16:24 The audio component or the video component, like the character, like their mouths are
01:16:28 animated in that style of like, you know, black background and like, you know, the colored outline.
01:16:33 And like they like draw their weapons and they like clash in the screen and they like shoot
01:16:38 past each other and like flash red and take damage and stuff.
01:16:42 It's a whole, it was a whole production.
01:16:45 Yeah.
01:16:45 That was that.
01:16:47 Before we fucking were like, why don't we just pay someone to make these episodes for us?
01:16:51 Nobody even watches them.
01:16:52 They just download the audio.
01:16:55 LaMalle.
01:16:57 That's what happened.
01:16:58 I have this image.
01:17:00 This image.
01:17:00 Excuse me.
01:17:02 Oh yeah.
01:17:02 I wanted to, that was a scrapped idea, but it's still cool.
01:17:06 Where was the VemSnakes mom with the snake boobs made out of snakes?
01:17:11 With the vagina.
01:17:13 Not sure I remember.
01:17:14 I don't know if you would have seen it.
01:17:15 This is like a completely separate thing.
01:17:18 Like, back when I was getting like way into like, when you were introducing me to VemSnakes and
01:17:23 showed me like the episode and stuff, I was, I just became a bit of a big fan.
01:17:28 So I need to find it for sure.
01:17:31 Yeah.
01:17:32 I did.
01:17:33 I went on 4chan at the time.
01:17:36 VemSnakes is, he's sexy, but also at the time also getting into
01:17:45 Choose Your Own Adventures, which is apparently just a thing that is on the MLP board for 4chan.
01:17:50 And I thought, I would love to do something like that.
01:17:53 And there's a whole thing where like, you're playing as underwater fish ponies and stuff like that.
01:17:58 And there's a weird plot about a bunch of.
01:18:01 On the sea ponies.
01:18:03 True they do.
01:18:04 Yeah.
01:18:05 When you're in distress.
01:18:07 Yeah, yeah, of course.
01:18:08 Should be due, should be due.
01:18:10 And there were a bunch of black snakes underwater for some reason that could just breathe, I guess.
01:18:16 And they were taking it over the whole land and terrorizing people.
01:18:19 And they were led by a gigantic milk snake that had giant, that had giant tits made out of snakes.
01:18:26 That's crazy shit.
01:18:29 Here we go.
01:18:29 Crazy shit, my dude.
01:18:32 Very, very old stuff, very, very old stuff.
01:18:37 Very good, very good.
01:18:40 I was a big fan of this.
01:18:41 I was starting to get really into, that is the best compliment you can give that, very good.
01:18:48 Yeah, I mean it's great, I love it.
01:18:50 It ended very quickly, but that is a thing that exists.
01:18:53 It's cute and good and I like it.
01:18:56 That is cute.
01:18:57 It has lesbians.
01:18:59 I guess when there was Lost Tapes Archive, which...
01:19:03 How that started was, Forai's had a really kind of funny psychic pebbles impression he was doing.
01:19:10 And calls a lot.
01:19:11 I thought, that's a funny voice.
01:19:13 What if we like make a voicemail character out of that?
01:19:15 And so we came up with the idea of this guy who just like finds all your dirty secrets and shit.
01:19:20 And I really wanted to do the Ben St. Licious meme.
01:19:25 And my partner, back then, this was before they started Pormones.
01:19:30 So they were able to do their Twilight voice still.
01:19:33 I remember you guys were like, wait, did they get Tara Strong?
01:19:35 And I was like, that was a compliment.
01:19:39 That was epic.
01:19:40 Oh, amazing, amazing.
01:19:43 I also remember Nate being like, huh, we're getting a lot of voicemails for Ben.
01:19:46 What about the rest of us, huh?
01:19:48 I remember that also being a thing.
01:19:50 Shut up.
01:19:50 Which is also my doing.
01:19:52 Where are you now, Ben?
01:19:54 Where are you now?
01:19:55 Yeah, exactly, exactly.
01:19:56 Ben's the most reliable person to pick on because he's always here.
01:20:00 Yeah.
01:20:03 And then from there, for Tom's tape, the one with the train,
01:20:06 like the Thomas Votan engine parody, we got Will Ryan.
01:20:10 He's a YouTuber with life.
01:20:11 I'd like me to go back and listen to all these again.
01:20:14 Now that all this is out in the open, the Vem Snake channel will be used to
01:20:19 archive compilations of every complete series of Clusters 1 Kitchen,
01:20:23 Vem Snake, Sloth's Tape Archive.
01:20:24 It's all going up there probably in February.
01:20:25 Oh my God.
01:20:27 Okay.
01:20:27 Well, I guess we'll have to link that in the description.
01:20:33 I don't know if it probably won't be archived that soon.
01:20:36 You can just link the Vem Snake's channel and it'll be up there in a few weeks probably.
01:20:40 Yeah, okay.
01:20:40 That'll work just as well.
01:20:41 That's pretty funny.
01:20:43 All right.
01:20:44 Yeah.
01:20:44 Vem Snake's channel.
01:20:46 I'll subscribe.
01:20:48 You weren't already subscribed?
01:20:49 Ooh, shameful.
01:20:50 I don't think so.
01:20:52 I don't think so.
01:20:53 Maybe I was.
01:20:54 You know, we should have Vem Snake's on the draw cast.
01:20:58 No, he's dead.
01:21:00 Bring him back.
01:21:01 He's fucked up.
01:21:02 He's dead.
01:21:02 No.
01:21:04 See, there's a thing.
01:21:05 That's my secret.
01:21:06 Yeah, just bring him back.
01:21:07 Vem Snake's has been on so many draw casts.
01:21:09 He's been on the rest of the world.
01:21:10 Just make him not dead.
01:21:13 Yeah, but as I was saying about the Tom Tape,
01:21:17 Will Ryan voiced some of the Thomas characters?
01:21:19 He's a YouTuber with over a million subscribers.
01:21:23 Did you say Will Ryan?
01:21:24 Yeah, Will Ryan of DA Games, that channel I work for.
01:21:27 Challenge everything.
01:21:28 Challenge everything.
01:21:29 Yeah.
01:21:30 Yeah.
01:21:30 So, it all got.
01:21:32 And then there was the DeVoo rap.
01:21:34 Oh, that was so great.
01:21:35 That's my ringtone.
01:21:36 That's ironically my ringtone.
01:21:38 I love it.
01:21:39 Yeah.
01:21:40 I like the goo.
01:21:41 I don't know.
01:21:43 Lost Tapes is my favorite series before I had the most effort put in.
01:21:46 There's a lot.
01:21:47 I had a lot of voicemails.
01:21:48 I had a lot of voicemails over the years.
01:21:50 Yeah.
01:21:51 And then there was Cluster Punk Kitchen.
01:21:54 I was editing the PCP during that.
01:21:55 I liked your book, Kiki.
01:21:57 Keto Delito.
01:21:58 Right, yeah.
01:21:58 That was good.
01:21:59 Yes.
01:21:59 Keto Delito.
01:22:00 That's why I was saying Keto for Cluster Punk Kitchen.
01:22:03 Yeah, Keto Delito.
01:22:05 I was Ben St. in that voicemail.
01:22:08 Oh, yeah.
01:22:10 You were the little Ben St. standing.
01:22:12 Well, I'm so sorry.
01:22:13 I'm so sorry for you.
01:22:15 It's tough.
01:22:16 It's okay.
01:22:17 I survived.
01:22:18 I've only lost an arm.
01:22:20 Then there's a whole bunch of minor.
01:22:23 There's a whole bunch of minor characters.
01:22:25 Right wing Richard.
01:22:27 Left wing Larry.
01:22:28 That was us.
01:22:31 Okay.
01:22:32 Center Sam.
01:22:33 Politics.
01:22:34 What are they?
01:22:36 Oh, yeah.
01:22:36 That was just a...
01:22:37 That literally came about as me just saying something random
01:22:39 and you just thought it was so funny that I just said that.
01:22:44 That was weird.
01:22:44 There was a double, double Satan.
01:22:45 Satan.
01:22:46 That was also me.
01:22:48 There's fucking hundreds.
01:22:49 I've done so many characters and so many voices.
01:22:51 Oh, yeah.
01:22:53 The big thing this year was the League of Nightfuckers,
01:22:55 which I created.
01:22:57 That was my brainchild.
01:23:00 I gathered Seatull and Four Eyes.
01:23:03 And I just have a funny idea.
01:23:05 I did it.
01:23:06 Okay.
01:23:06 It didn't actually start when Michelle thought
01:23:09 Sean was going to spicy salt.
01:23:12 And we were talking about that situation.
01:23:15 And that gave you the idea.
01:23:16 I heard that Michelle thought
01:23:19 that Sean was going to sex Nate or something.
01:23:22 And I'm like, and...
01:23:23 Sean...
01:23:23 Wait, who's Sean?
01:23:24 Sean Dawn.
01:23:26 Sean Dawn.
01:23:26 He made the...
01:23:27 Oh, right.
01:23:29 Yes.
01:23:30 Yeah, yeah.
01:23:31 Okay.
01:23:31 That's Sean.
01:23:32 Sorry.
01:23:32 I was thinking of the Skull YouTuber.
01:23:34 Yeah.
01:23:35 You drew him a thing recently.
01:23:36 Oh, yeah.
01:23:37 He wants to fuck Nate.
01:23:38 Yes, I know.
01:23:39 Yes, I know.
01:23:39 I drew his sword.
01:23:41 Sorry.
01:23:42 I was just thinking of a different show.
01:23:43 So anyways, I heard Michelle thought
01:23:45 that Sean wanted to fuck Nate.
01:23:46 And I'm like, that's not true.
01:23:47 But that's also really funny.
01:23:50 You know what?
01:23:50 Everyone wants to fuck Nate now.
01:23:52 And so I sat down and like,
01:23:53 this is like two weeks in advance.
01:23:54 I'm like, we need to make like a bunch of voicemails
01:23:57 and like submit them all back to back.
01:23:59 Just all of them.
01:24:00 And then we thought of like the Thousand Lung Man
01:24:02 who's just like, like fucking breathing.
01:24:05 We did one from Lost Tapes Archive.
01:24:07 I did one as Van Snakes.
01:24:08 A bunch, just a bunch of fucking freaks.
01:24:10 That's where the William came from.
01:24:12 My favorite one was the Freddy Freaker parody.
01:24:14 Yeah, the Freddy Freaker song was so good.
01:24:17 And you and Gib also were like fucking dying during that.
01:24:21 Yes.
01:24:22 And then we just kept going.
01:24:25 Ben, do you remember the Lord of the Rings, Smeagol?
01:24:28 Oh, yes.
01:24:29 Nate fucker.
01:24:30 Yeah.
01:24:31 Yeah.
01:24:31 Yeah, I remember Smeagol.
01:24:32 Yeah.
01:24:33 Don't do Smeagol.
01:24:36 That was for us.
01:24:37 Yes.
01:24:38 Okay.
01:24:39 This feels like this feels like the end of an era.
01:24:42 Yes.
01:24:42 The human guitar.
01:24:43 Oh God, human guitar.
01:24:45 Poor Alie Azar.
01:24:46 Every time I submitted a human guitar voicemail,
01:24:48 he would message me being like oblivion.
01:24:49 Please my ears.
01:24:50 I'm like, I'm sorry, I have to punish Ben St.
01:24:54 It's the only way.
01:24:55 It's the only way.
01:24:57 True.
01:24:58 You're an unfortunate side effect.
01:25:00 The Legendary.
01:25:01 You too.
01:25:01 Yeah, he's a collateral damage.
01:25:04 He's collateral damage.
01:25:06 It's all about just messing with Ben St's head
01:25:08 that's been in the game for like three years,
01:25:11 four years almost, probably.
01:25:13 What am I supposed to do?
01:25:14 Not do that?
01:25:17 Exactly.
01:25:18 Sorry.
01:25:19 Yeah.
01:25:20 It is an unhealthy, genuinely,
01:25:22 it's an unhealthy addiction I've had,
01:25:24 just making voicemails is a dumb idea.
01:25:25 And then I spend like three or four hours.
01:25:28 New year's resolution is get clean,
01:25:31 get clean off voicemails.
01:25:32 No more voicemails.
01:25:33 This is like, I'm blowing my little all white joke.
01:25:36 That's what that was.
01:25:37 This man has been in the middle of work,
01:25:39 get an idea for a voicemail,
01:25:40 and then spend like two to three hours not doing work
01:25:43 so he can get this idea perfectly out.
01:25:46 And he's just like, please do this voice for me.
01:25:47 I know that feeling.
01:25:48 I know that feeling.
01:25:50 Not for the PCP.
01:25:51 I would never like do work for the PCP.
01:25:55 For other things.
01:25:58 Gotcha.
01:25:59 Okay.
01:26:00 Well, this really is voicemails revelations.
01:26:05 It's all coming out in the watch.
01:26:08 It's all coming out.
01:26:08 Third impact, baby.
01:26:10 And the third impact.
01:26:11 Yeah.
01:26:12 Oh, God.
01:26:13 So now we know.
01:26:14 The pig saga was so good.
01:26:16 The terrible truth.
01:26:17 The pig saga was so good.
01:26:18 Turns out there was a voicemail cinematic universe.
01:26:21 The voicemail cinematic universe created by me
01:26:23 and my friends who I roped into it.
01:26:25 Yes.
01:26:26 And it's been going on even since before I was the editor.
01:26:30 I even managed to fucking get on as VemSnakes,
01:26:32 which was so funny.
01:26:34 There's so many points.
01:26:35 Like when the first time I came on the PCP
01:26:37 as the believe in fall, I'm sitting here like,
01:26:38 I've been here before and they don't even fucking know.
01:26:41 Yeah.
01:26:42 Yeah.
01:26:44 I mean, I had some inkling, but I'm sure there were suspicions.
01:26:51 Do you really think all of these people were oblivion fall?
01:26:54 I knew that some of them were oblivion fall.
01:26:57 I didn't exactly know who, but I think it was pretty obvious.
01:27:01 I knew that.
01:27:01 No, I knew that.
01:27:02 I knew that ClusterPunk kitchen.
01:27:04 Yeah.
01:27:05 For sure.
01:27:06 Oh, yeah.
01:27:06 That's just my regular voice.
01:27:07 Just slowed down.
01:27:08 Yeah.
01:27:09 Yeah.
01:27:13 Human guitar, I think, is also pretty clearly your voice
01:27:17 if you can listen past the filter.
01:27:19 I also just spilled the beans on that one immediately.
01:27:23 So.
01:27:23 Oh, yeah.
01:27:24 I thought it was a surprise.
01:27:26 Well, I guess we'll just never have another good voicemail ever again.
01:27:30 Exactly.
01:27:32 You're all these shit from now on.
01:27:34 We've peaked.
01:27:35 This is it.
01:27:36 I think so.
01:27:37 So, I mean, should we listen to some bad voicemails?
01:27:42 Oh, yeah.
01:27:43 Yeah, let's go for it.
01:27:45 All right.
01:27:46 I guess let's let's let's do some and just see what just see what remains.
01:27:51 All right.
01:27:51 Let's see what the kingdom of ashes is left for us to to reign over.
01:27:57 Let's see what the nuclear apocalypse looks like.
01:28:00 I think so.
01:28:00 I think that's right.
01:28:02 All right.
01:28:03 First one of today is it's called Keckfest 2020.
01:28:11 Okay.
01:28:12 Sorry.
01:28:12 My folder computer.
01:28:16 Oh, God.
01:28:17 Oh, my God.
01:28:19 Okay.
01:28:20 Never mind.
01:28:21 It's a three second voicemail.
01:28:22 I think there's a.
01:28:24 Okay.
01:28:25 Yeah.
01:28:25 Listen to that.
01:28:26 But the actual voicemail is here.
01:28:28 It's a YouTube link here is the link.
01:28:33 Okay.
01:28:35 What the?
01:28:35 Simeon Jimmy's treehouse procrastinators podcast versus Simeon Jimmy.
01:28:41 What?
01:28:41 This is just monkey.
01:28:42 What is this?
01:28:43 The fuck is this?
01:28:43 This is a 46 minute monkey video.
01:28:47 Is this new?
01:28:48 This came out.
01:28:49 Oh, yeah.
01:28:49 This came out at the end of last year.
01:28:52 Whoa.
01:28:52 Like two days ago.
01:28:53 What?
01:28:54 What the fuck is this?
01:28:55 Okay.
01:28:56 This came up two days ago.
01:28:58 Yeah.
01:29:00 I guess I better give this a watch.
01:29:01 That's I'm concerned.
01:29:03 Yeah.
01:29:03 I'll wash that later.
01:29:04 I guess.
01:29:05 Oh, God.
01:29:06 How embarrassing.
01:29:07 I, uh, uh, this is, uh.
01:29:10 It's been so long since I heard monkey's voice.
01:29:13 I'm like, I'm like concerned.
01:29:15 I'm like afraid to listen to this.
01:29:17 I don't even want to know what he's going to say.
01:29:21 Treksy's under digital brain.
01:29:24 Oh, my gosh.
01:29:25 This calm, this comment.
01:29:26 Comment on this video.
01:29:27 Wait, what does this say?
01:29:28 Um, holy shit.
01:29:30 I woke up from a four year coma.
01:29:31 I've missed so many uploads from the PCP.
01:29:33 I can't wait to see all the crazy content
01:29:34 they made together in the PCP house.
01:29:36 And what the bleep in the weave.
01:29:37 Can't wait for those bleep and weave
01:29:39 Blu-rays baby.
01:29:40 Yeah.
01:29:40 Get with the bleep and weave video
01:29:42 that I spent $500 crowdfunding look like.
01:29:44 And I sure hope that Digi is living successfully
01:29:46 with his wife and hasn't become
01:29:48 a literal homeless drug addict.
01:29:49 Getting less than 200 views for video.
01:29:51 Oh boy.
01:29:52 I'm so excited.
01:29:53 Uh, the bleep, Blu-rays baby.
01:29:57 The Blu-rays are real.
01:29:59 What a time.
01:30:00 What a time to be alive.
01:30:02 Men saying to the rescue.
01:30:04 Yeah.
01:30:05 At least, at least,
01:30:06 chap McBloake making from his coma
01:30:09 love something to look forward to.
01:30:11 And that's those Blu-rays.
01:30:13 I see, I see a comment from Project FM.
01:30:16 Imagine forgetting both mother's basement
01:30:18 and the DeVoo, but not Si.
01:30:21 Yeah, like Si is listed as a member here.
01:30:26 I mentioned that I asked Si
01:30:28 if he wanted to come on the show
01:30:29 and he was just like, nah,
01:30:31 he's just too good.
01:30:32 He's too good for the PCP now.
01:30:35 Tragic, tragic.
01:30:37 Mother's basement would absolutely come on though.
01:30:39 Mother's basement would never turn down the PCP.
01:30:42 This is a fact.
01:30:44 No, there's a guy with integrity.
01:30:46 There's a guy who would never turn his back
01:30:48 on his old pals at the Procrastinators podcast.
01:30:52 Okay, that's very funny.
01:30:54 Obviously, we're not going to watch it
01:30:56 because it's 40 minutes long.
01:30:58 Link in the description to
01:31:01 Simi and Jimmy's Treehouse Procrastinators podcast.
01:31:04 If there's a Simi...
01:31:04 I'm like, ugh.
01:31:06 I don't want to know what he has to say.
01:31:08 Apparently, he replaced DeVoo with Si last minute for some reason.
01:31:17 Sure, whatever.
01:31:20 Okay, so that's very funny, probably.
01:31:24 Next voicemail is here.
01:31:27 I'll put it in chat.
01:31:28 It is called...
01:31:30 What's it called?
01:31:31 It's called a concerned viewer.
01:31:35 Okay, three, two, one, go.
01:31:39 Hey, PCP.
01:31:40 You ever wonder what happened to that one fellow
01:31:43 who was just always really thirsty?
01:31:46 At least, I don't think we've heard from him in a while.
01:31:49 But then, I remember, it's dry dump December.
01:31:54 He's not thirsty anymore.
01:31:57 He's absorbing back all the moisture from the poo he's been holding in.
01:32:01 We've done so much good.
01:32:02 He's really changed someone's life for the better.
01:32:03 Yeah.
01:32:04 And thank you for that.
01:32:05 You're the best PCP.
01:32:07 Hell yeah.
01:32:08 You're doing good.
01:32:09 You know, a couple of days ago was dried up December for me
01:32:12 during the height of my fever.
01:32:14 I guess all the moisture in my body was just being like
01:32:16 sucked out into sweat.
01:32:18 And I had to...
01:32:18 You needed it.
01:32:20 My butt was glued shut.
01:32:22 God.
01:32:23 It was awful.
01:32:24 Wow, that's nasty.
01:32:25 That's just fucked up.
01:32:26 Dried up December.
01:32:26 It's just fucked up.
01:32:27 Delicious.
01:32:28 That's just beyond the pale.
01:32:30 Eleazar, edit that out, please.
01:32:32 I'll edit that out, Eleazar.
01:32:33 Thanks, Ele.
01:32:34 Thanks, Eleazar.
01:32:35 Oblivion, edit Eleazar.
01:32:37 Oblivion, edit Eleazar back in.
01:32:39 He's good.
01:32:40 Oblivion Fall.
01:32:41 Eddie at...
01:32:41 Yeah, put it...
01:32:42 Oblivion Fall, fuck you.
01:32:44 Get out of here.
01:32:44 Put Eleazar back in the episode in the editing bay.
01:32:47 Thank you.
01:32:49 God bless.
01:32:51 Next episode is called...
01:32:52 TheFAG is on Twitter.
01:32:55 This is at FAG Penridge, all one word.
01:32:59 You remember, this was that club that was
01:33:02 doing a counter turning point USA
01:33:06 campaign at their school.
01:33:08 Oh, yes.
01:33:09 Yes, I remember this.
01:33:10 I remember this.
01:33:11 Okay, three, two, one, go.
01:33:14 Hey, PCP.
01:33:15 I called in a little bit ago, maybe two weeks ago,
01:33:17 about the FAG, the Fellowship of Atheist Gamers.
01:33:21 And I just wanted to call back in to say
01:33:23 that the FAG has a Twitter account now.
01:33:26 Who, boy?
01:33:27 Because I know that Instagram's kind of for Zoomers
01:33:30 and there's more for Boomers.
01:33:32 So I'm just trying to diversify our platforms.
01:33:35 And now we have a Twitter.
01:33:36 It is at FAG Penridge, at Fag Penridge.
01:33:41 And it's just going to be the uploading
01:33:43 what's already on the Instagram account.
01:33:45 But it turns out that Turning Point Penridge
01:33:47 also has a Twitter account.
01:33:48 So, yeah, I get it.
01:33:51 Now we're taking a full frontal assault.
01:33:53 Everywhere.
01:33:53 Oh, boy.
01:33:54 You got to take it to the streets.
01:33:56 Well, we are liberal.
01:33:58 Hashtag love is love.
01:33:59 Hashtag FAG.
01:34:01 The official page for the Penridge chapter
01:34:03 of the Fellowship of Atheist Gamers.
01:34:05 Take the blue pill.
01:34:07 I don't know.
01:34:10 I don't know anything about these people.
01:34:11 But every single tweet that they make,
01:34:13 I fully endorse and 100% believe in.
01:34:16 100, agreed.
01:34:17 Agreed.
01:34:18 I'm doing it.
01:34:19 I'm giving them a follow.
01:34:21 I'm giving them a follow.
01:34:22 They're tweeting little pamphlets.
01:34:24 That's neat.
01:34:27 And that's an endorsement.
01:34:28 Yeah, a little Jimmy Carter, Grover Cleveland,
01:34:31 a little historical section search.
01:34:32 Here are three reasons why capitalism
01:34:35 is an optimized and fair system.
01:34:39 I like their reasons.
01:34:40 Damn it, he's right.
01:34:41 Yeah, look at them.
01:34:43 What are their reasons?
01:34:44 See them?
01:34:50 Good one.
01:34:51 Good one.
01:34:51 Got them.
01:34:54 That'll show capitalism.
01:34:56 Is epic.
01:34:58 Endorse.
01:34:58 It is epic.
01:34:59 It is a little epic.
01:35:00 I support it.
01:35:02 Okay, next voicemail is just who chooses
01:35:06 the episode titles and usually Eleazar.
01:35:10 Usually Eleazar just picks them
01:35:13 unless I say I want it to be called something else.
01:35:16 But usually I don't do that.
01:35:18 Yeah, Eleazar.
01:35:19 Okay, next one is just called E,
01:35:23 the lowercase letter E.
01:35:25 It's uploading.
01:35:26 Okay, there it is.
01:35:27 Three, two, one, go.
01:35:30 Eleazar always makes good thumbnails,
01:35:33 but the last one let me down.
01:35:35 Why isn't the thumbnail Ben Sainte with huge tits?
01:35:39 We have that, don't we?
01:35:41 Yeah.
01:35:42 Don't we have Ben Sainte with huge tits
01:35:44 taking the blue pill somewhere?
01:35:46 Blue tits.
01:35:47 Blue tits.
01:35:49 Oh no, blueberry inflation.
01:35:50 It's all coming full circle.
01:35:51 One though.
01:35:52 Right, because last week me and Gibb talked
01:35:54 about how oppressed big booby women are
01:35:56 and how they're all gate kept out of Hollywood.
01:35:59 And there aren't enough leading women in Hollywood
01:36:00 with huge knockers.
01:36:02 It's true.
01:36:03 It's fucked up.
01:36:05 And so in solidarity, I've given myself huge tits.
01:36:09 With enough synthetic plastic, we can fix that.
01:36:12 Yeah, we can fix that.
01:36:14 Even Ben Sainte can have huge tits.
01:36:15 Technology sure is incredible.
01:36:18 Even Ben Sainte.
01:36:19 Even, even, yeah.
01:36:21 The greatest technology of all, Ben Sainte.
01:36:26 Next voicemail is called X5321GO.
01:36:32 He is coming for you, Ben Sainte.
01:36:42 Oh no.
01:36:44 He's still coming.
01:36:45 For me to see.
01:36:46 You know, it's kind of, we haven't really
01:36:48 shared that sort of information.
01:36:49 You got big fills to shoot.
01:36:51 We got another arc, baby.
01:36:53 We got another character.
01:36:54 We got some new characters in the voicemails.
01:36:58 These are the people picking up them snakes mantle.
01:37:00 Picking up the slack, yeah.
01:37:02 Picking up the skin.
01:37:03 Season 12 of the Ben Sainte arc.
01:37:06 There's an arc.
01:37:06 There's an arc here.
01:37:07 This is, we're in the midst of it.
01:37:09 We're at the top of it.
01:37:10 We're hanging suspended in midair before the fall.
01:37:15 The second half we come plummeting down to the ground.
01:37:18 Next voicemail is another YouTube link.
01:37:22 And it asks what to make of this at gmail.com.
01:37:25 Oh, it's the same link.
01:37:27 It's another one.
01:37:28 The procrastinators podcast for two people.
01:37:30 Okay, fair.
01:37:32 Okay, fair.
01:37:33 Big news.
01:37:35 Tell you next week, maybe.
01:37:37 I don't know.
01:37:39 I don't think I'm going to watch it.
01:37:41 It makes me a little uncomfortable.
01:37:42 I'll tell you in the comment section.
01:37:43 I'll tell you in the comment section what to make of it.
01:37:46 I think it's funny and concept,
01:37:47 but I don't know if I actually want to sit through it.
01:37:51 Just for my personal comfort, Lamal.
01:37:55 Next voicemail is called Talking Pirates in a Nutshell.
01:38:00 Parentheses, it's good.
01:38:02 It's good.
01:38:04 It's good.
01:38:05 All right, three, two, one, go.
01:38:08 So, Jimbe bad, hockey bad, law bad.
01:38:16 Yes.
01:38:17 Oda make mistake, law bad, pre-timeskip, good.
01:38:25 Yes.
01:38:26 Booba.
01:38:28 Booba.
01:38:28 Booba.
01:38:29 All good.
01:38:30 Booba.
01:38:30 New bad.
01:38:31 But booba is eternal.
01:38:33 Booba is timeless.
01:38:35 I think I agree.
01:38:36 I've seen that before and after.
01:38:37 That sounds about right.
01:38:39 I've seen the exaggeration of Oda's work with One Piece,
01:38:42 and it's amazing how much every woman in that
01:38:45 has just become more of a bimbo.
01:38:47 That's good.
01:38:49 One Piece is the real binification poll.
01:38:52 These do sound like Nate's opinions,
01:38:54 as far as I'm aware of them.
01:38:55 So, I mean, it's just, yeah.
01:38:57 Oh, I found it.
01:38:58 It's like you never left.
01:38:59 I found the picture of you with big boobs, Ben.
01:39:02 I found it.
01:39:03 Here you go.
01:39:04 Oh boy.
01:39:05 Oh, shit, nice.
01:39:06 Oh, wow.
01:39:07 Oh, yeah, I remember this one.
01:39:10 Yeah.
01:39:11 Yeah.
01:39:11 Good shit.
01:39:12 Good shit.
01:39:13 Hey, I'm getting the beard back.
01:39:15 Again, I'm getting beardy again.
01:39:17 Those are some guitar pick-shaped boobs.
01:39:19 Yeah, they're not big enough.
01:39:23 That size would get me cast in Hollywood.
01:39:26 I'll give them the weight and the sag desired.
01:39:29 I'll make you a true busty boy, Ben,
01:39:31 yet you'll see.
01:39:32 Just make sure he's also still taking the pills.
01:39:36 You know, but change the pills to something else.
01:39:39 Just booby pills, maybe.
01:39:40 It's a good change to make them blue.
01:39:43 You gave me the pink hair.
01:39:44 We need a rule 60 free, Ben saying, to be honest.
01:39:48 You gave me pink hair, blue pills, tits.
01:39:53 All I need is pronouns, and then I'd be good to go.
01:39:56 Do you not already have pronouns?
01:39:56 Oh, Simon drew this?
01:39:58 Yeah, Simon drew this.
01:40:00 I have, sorry, my pronoun game is just...
01:40:05 I think Simon's still any old, but I default to she-they.
01:40:10 Well, that's fine.
01:40:12 I'm talking about me, though.
01:40:13 Can we keep the focus on me, where it belongs?
01:40:15 Thank you.
01:40:16 No.
01:40:18 I'm sorry.
01:40:19 Next voice, they, yeah, yep, you are.
01:40:23 Next voicemail is called My Favorite PCP Member.
01:40:29 Three, two, one, go.
01:40:31 You know, I was thinking about my favorite PCP member,
01:40:36 and I went back to watch the old episodes,
01:40:38 and it always used to be Digi, Best Guy Ever,
01:40:43 and Jesse, and guys like them.
01:40:46 Now, my favorites are obviously Tom, Ben Benzane,
01:40:51 that you give, and honestly, fuck everybody else.
01:40:55 Well, you gotta go back, watch those old episodes,
01:40:58 just everyone else is a fucking idiot,
01:41:00 and then there's Ben, Tom, and give the legends.
01:41:05 So, you're saying your opinion has changed in hindsight,
01:41:09 which is fair.
01:41:10 Yes, clearly.
01:41:11 I mean, I agree.
01:41:12 I hate those fucking guys, and that's not true.
01:41:16 Well, I hate Digi, obviously.
01:41:18 Trixie, Beatrice, Blu-rays, even we Blu-rays.
01:41:23 Trixie, Blue Horse, Blu-rays.
01:41:27 Blue Pill?
01:41:28 Blue Berries?
01:41:30 Blue Berry, Violet Beauregard, Blu-rays, Blu-Pills.
01:41:35 Time is a flat circle.
01:41:37 Time is a flat circle, it's true.
01:41:39 Time is a flat circle, it's true.
01:41:43 Buy my fucking shit.
01:41:46 Hey, buy a Blu-ray.
01:41:47 While you're buying a Blu-ray, why not buy a copy of Rotoradcon?
01:41:52 I got those, I got like 50 more of those.
01:41:54 Please, please sell me out.
01:41:56 I don't want 50 of them.
01:41:58 I got mine.
01:41:59 That's good to know.
01:42:00 You know, I had kind of hoped to have the Radcon dogen ready by now too,
01:42:04 so I could maybe have, I could sell it all.
01:42:06 I will give like a bulk discount if you buy the dogen and the Rotoradcon,
01:42:10 but the dogen has seen unforeseen delays whose nature I will not elaborate upon here.
01:42:17 Because you're not a messy bitch.
01:42:18 I do get angry about it.
01:42:20 I do get upset.
01:42:21 I do get upset in the, in some bonus content and some behind the scenes bonus content.
01:42:27 I did, I did rave a little bit about it to Gibb last week,
01:42:31 but that's whatever.
01:42:32 That's not, that's not main show talk.
01:42:35 Yeah.
01:42:36 Anyway, what the fuck was I talking about?
01:42:42 Oh, next episode is called Digimon Lecture 321 Go.
01:42:50 On episode 274, Ben was floating the idea of doing a lecture on the real Digimon forums
01:42:55 where most of it is stuff from the something awful third or from memory
01:42:58 and Jack went, that sounds kind of bad lol.
01:43:01 No, it doesn't.
01:43:02 It sounds amazing.
01:43:03 Who gives a single solitary shit about proof?
01:43:05 All of the lectures are just people talking about their memory of the interesting topic at hand.
01:43:10 That's not entirely true.
01:43:10 There's been times in lectures where an audience member asked a question
01:43:13 and the lecturer didn't know the answer.
01:43:15 These aren't encyclopedic 100% accurate records of the topic at hand.
01:43:19 They're engaging retellings.
01:43:21 The real Digimon believers shit sounds great.
01:43:24 Do it.
01:43:24 Fuck the haters.
01:43:25 The real, yeah, the real Digimon believers shit is, it was great.
01:43:29 It was awesome.
01:43:30 It's just that, I don't know.
01:43:33 It's just that simply like not much of the record of it exists.
01:43:36 And like, I'd be the, I can, all I can really do with the Digimon believer stuff at this point
01:43:41 is explain what it was and then like, there's not, it doesn't really take that long to explain.
01:43:48 Yeah.
01:43:48 Take a page out of Trixie's book.
01:43:50 Do the mini lectures.
01:43:51 You can make a 10 minute video essay on it.
01:43:53 Oh, the, the little, the little lecture.
01:43:56 Yeah, that are just like small videos.
01:43:59 About like, about like why like you should diagnose yourself with autism or whatever.
01:44:04 Yeah.
01:44:06 Okay.
01:44:06 Yeah, just do one of those, but about something good.
01:44:09 You know, you've been stealing all of Trixie's ideas and making them good.
01:44:13 Why not just do it again?
01:44:14 That's true.
01:44:16 That's true.
01:44:16 I hope she gets mad.
01:44:18 I hope she gets upset about the, the Blu-rays.
01:44:22 Ah, that'd be funny.
01:44:23 That would be really funny.
01:44:24 It would be.
01:44:24 It would be funny.
01:44:26 I could see her thinking that she could be like, oh, that's my intellectual property though,
01:44:30 which would be very funny.
01:44:32 I mean, I don't know if that'll happen.
01:44:33 She's probably to check that.
01:44:35 She'd have to get-
01:44:35 She's probably to checked out to even, to even notice.
01:44:38 Yeah.
01:44:38 To do anything with that, she'd have to also get Jess on board.
01:44:41 And I think, I don't know the guy.
01:44:42 I feel like he just be happy it's all over.
01:44:45 Like it's done.
01:44:46 It's off his back.
01:44:47 That's the impression I get too.
01:44:48 I think Jesse would just not want to even have anything to do with it,
01:44:53 which is what he has been doing for years.
01:44:57 Okay.
01:44:57 Next voicemail, it was, next, this is the last voicemail.
01:45:02 Oh, fuck yeah.
01:45:03 Well, it's a second long.
01:45:04 Wait.
01:45:05 Sorry, no.
01:45:06 Anyway, listen, three, two, one, go.
01:45:08 Formation in this.
01:45:11 What?
01:45:12 It's so quiet.
01:45:13 It's very quiet.
01:45:13 Formation boost, what the fuck does that even mean?
01:45:16 I don't know.
01:45:16 Well, there's a YouTube link attached to it.
01:45:20 Oh, I knew it.
01:45:22 I knew it.
01:45:24 Yeah.
01:45:24 I mentioned last week, I thought I said, I asked like,
01:45:27 was there an endless just fuck football video?
01:45:30 And I thought it was no, but yeah, I guess there was.
01:45:31 Okay.
01:45:32 I was right.
01:45:32 I knew it.
01:45:34 I knew it.
01:45:37 Okay.
01:45:37 Well, that's good to know.
01:45:39 You weren't wrong after all, Ben.
01:45:40 You weren't wrong after all.
01:45:42 I was right.
01:45:43 I do remember the, maybe COVID didn't shrink my brain that much
01:45:46 after all.
01:45:47 I remember stuff.
01:45:50 I was wrong.
01:45:50 There's one more voicemail, but here it is.
01:45:53 It's three seconds long.
01:45:56 It's called, in my opinion.
01:45:58 Okay.
01:45:59 Three, two, one, go.
01:46:02 In my opinion, all pro and on should die.
01:46:05 Yeah.
01:46:06 Iceborg.
01:46:07 Well, hello.
01:46:08 Wow.
01:46:09 Iceborg.
01:46:11 Hard agree.
01:46:14 Thoughts.
01:46:14 Is the pro and on still occurring?
01:46:17 Does that still exist?
01:46:18 Yeah.
01:46:19 We did a New Year's episode.
01:46:21 It's mostly just a friend group where we hang out and vibe.
01:46:26 Die.
01:46:27 Die.
01:46:27 Die.
01:46:28 No.
01:46:29 I mean, soon I'm going to be streaming Disco Elysium on the pro and on channel
01:46:33 if you're interested in that.
01:46:36 It's Pog.
01:46:37 And there's also my Stardew streams.
01:46:39 You're Stardew?
01:46:41 Yeah.
01:46:42 Stardew.
01:46:43 I play as Garfield.
01:46:45 I roll play as Garfield.
01:46:50 I had a Stardew Valley game that I like complete.
01:46:54 I was going to I was going to pave the entire world.
01:46:56 That was my plan for Stardew Valley.
01:46:59 By making like pavement tiles and just placing there.
01:47:02 I paved a lot of it, but not enough.
01:47:06 We go back to it then.
01:47:06 It was pretty funny.
01:47:08 You can always pick it back up.
01:47:09 You know, I had a world where I like I it was like islands.
01:47:13 Like my farm was like had like an island layout and I paved all the islands and I built bridges
01:47:19 and I put like I had slime farms.
01:47:23 I had slime slime hatcheries and I like I organized all the slimes by color on different
01:47:28 little islands and I paved everything and it was all nice and nice and industrial look.
01:47:34 It was spent like really long time because it's really tedious to do to make the the paved
01:47:41 I think there's a shortcut now to like make a bunch of them at once, which is pretty base.
01:47:48 Oh, that's pretty good.
01:47:49 Yeah, I would have been helpful.
01:47:51 I have a very little experience with Stardew, but I did play multiplayer once.
01:47:57 Someone on Twitter, GabaNinja1 on Twitter just coincidentally added me and asked
01:48:03 where's the announcement.
01:48:04 I'm pretty sure they're talking about because I said I was going to announce
01:48:07 the secret project on New Year's.
01:48:10 The reason I haven't announced it on Twitter.
01:48:12 I will have announced it by the time this episode comes out.
01:48:14 The reason I haven't announced it on Twitter is because literally because I had COVID,
01:48:19 I have not been able to go to Munchie's house and take a picture of myself holding
01:48:26 the Blu-ray in my hand while it's like playing on the television.
01:48:30 I want to take that picture and be like the Blu-ray is real.
01:48:33 Here's what it looks like.
01:48:34 It actually has like a menu system and stuff.
01:48:38 I just need to get that picture and then I can announce it.
01:48:41 And just because I'm still COVID positive, I have not been able to go over there and do that.
01:48:45 So there's a reason why I put me behind schedule because I said I was going to
01:48:48 announce it on New Year's, but I was set back slightly.
01:48:53 2021.
01:48:54 You wouldn't risk Munchie's home.
01:48:56 No. I have to go to the printer and pick up the DVD sleeves, like the cover jacket.
01:49:04 I have one.
01:49:05 I have one box that has a sleeve that I'm going to use for the picture.
01:49:08 And then I have 48.
01:49:10 I have 50 more in a box that I need to pick up and put on the other 50 boxes
01:49:14 because I made a batch of 50 of them.
01:49:17 They are sitting in my closet.
01:49:19 They have been quarantined from myself.
01:49:22 I have not gone in my closet and fucked with them since I got COVID.
01:49:27 Because I want to keep them uncontaminated.
01:49:29 I'm pretty sure it's fine.
01:49:32 Even if I had breathed on them, COVID doesn't live on surfaces forever.
01:49:39 It dies after a few days, I think.
01:49:42 So it would be fine anyway, but I'm trying to keep them away from myself just in case.
01:49:48 Something like on plastics, it lasts three days and on cardboard,
01:49:51 it lasts two days or one day or something.
01:49:54 Okay.
01:49:55 So it should be fine.
01:49:58 Maybe I'll just wait a couple of days after my...
01:50:01 I'll wait a couple of days after my I'm negative before I actually send any.
01:50:05 Just be super, super safe.
01:50:08 Spray some Windex on it.
01:50:10 Yeah.
01:50:12 I guess I could do that.
01:50:13 Yeah, just a little bit of disinfecting.
01:50:15 Spray it directly onto the surface of the disc.
01:50:20 And then scour and scrub it really hard.
01:50:23 Yeah.
01:50:23 I'm just saying I'm absolutely sure it gets any contaminants off of there.
01:50:26 Just leave the disinfectant on for like five minutes.
01:50:30 That'll get rid of any like germs and stuff.
01:50:33 And then you wipe it away and you're done.
01:50:36 I gotta complain about this.
01:50:37 It was so hard finding...
01:50:42 It was easy to order Blu-ray discs that had a printable surface so that I could like print
01:50:47 an image onto the disc.
01:50:49 Getting discs like that was easy, but finding a way to actually print the image onto those discs
01:50:56 was unbelievably hard.
01:50:58 And I called like so many different printing services and like local print shops and was
01:51:03 like, can you print on this disc?
01:51:04 And they were all like, no, we won't do it.
01:51:07 We simply won't do it.
01:51:09 But you can buy a printer that does it.
01:51:12 And ultimately this is what I had to do.
01:51:13 I literally...
01:51:14 Oh, I didn't buy it.
01:51:14 I asked my parents if they would get me one as like a Christmas present and they were like,
01:51:18 sure, whatever.
01:51:20 So they got me a printer for Christmas that has a disc.
01:51:25 It's a Canon printer.
01:51:26 It's only like a $200 printer.
01:51:28 Like it's not an incredibly expensive piece of equipment, but it has a tray that you can
01:51:31 put a disc in and it will print on the disc.
01:51:33 It's just a thing you can buy for not that much money on a home printer.
01:51:38 And yet commercial printers, they just like, no, we can't do it.
01:51:41 We simply don't have the technology.
01:51:43 We just don't have a machine that does it.
01:51:46 Sorry.
01:51:47 I tried.
01:51:48 I really tried.
01:51:49 I didn't want to buy a whole printer over it, but I had to.
01:51:53 I was like, okay.
01:51:55 So that was my...
01:51:56 This was like a month-long struggle that I went through trying to find a method of printing
01:52:00 images onto discs when it worked out.
01:52:03 Damn.
01:52:03 That was by far the hardest part of the whole process.
01:52:07 I got a Serbian guy named Slobodan to actually do the...
01:52:13 To do the...
01:52:13 Slobodan, that's great.
01:52:14 Like the data, like to build the actual like DVD file and like menus and stuff.
01:52:19 I got a guy on Fiverr to do it.
01:52:22 Slobodan, he's my guy.
01:52:25 Give me an incredible deal.
01:52:26 Other people were asking for like $500 for this job.
01:52:29 This guy was like, I'll do it for 100.
01:52:31 He did it perfectly.
01:52:34 He did it exactly what I could have wanted for.
01:52:35 I was like, this guy saved me so much money.
01:52:37 I tipped him 50%.
01:52:39 Did you put him in the credits?
01:52:41 Credit to Slobodan?
01:52:43 No.
01:52:45 No, I didn't.
01:52:46 No, I didn't.
01:52:47 I should have put it on the back.
01:52:49 I should have put it on the back of the box.
01:52:51 Label, I should have been like, uh, credits to Slobodan.
01:52:53 Shout outs to Slobodan.
01:52:55 Just pull paper inserts.
01:52:57 Just a little piece of paper that says credits to Slobodan.
01:53:01 It's, it's great.
01:53:02 It's like you put, you put it in the fucking Blu-ray player.
01:53:05 There's a menu screen and it plays the jingle by Sick Rick.
01:53:08 The little, the like the background song for the season two, Plebe and the Weeb theme song.
01:53:14 I added bonus features.
01:53:16 There are bonus features, including a special message from Ben St.
01:53:20 That's an exclusive, exclusive content on there.
01:53:25 I went all out.
01:53:26 I went all out.
01:53:27 I think it's like the funniest fucking thing ever.
01:53:32 I can't wait for people to have them.
01:53:34 So I'm very, I'm very excited.
01:53:36 I'm very excited about these.
01:53:37 Yeah, you can tell.
01:53:38 That's good.
01:53:39 Anyway, I'm glad it's finally out.
01:53:40 Yeah, sorry.
01:53:40 And that other people don't know about it.
01:53:42 Don't apologize.
01:53:44 Stop that.
01:53:45 Yeah.
01:53:45 It's fine.
01:53:46 You're fine.
01:53:47 I got, yeah, the Blu-ray, the Blu-ray burner you bought me broke.
01:53:52 I know.
01:53:53 I was there when you were complaining and I couldn't get ahold of them.
01:53:56 I was so mad.
01:53:58 I burned, I burned one disc and then it fucking broke.
01:54:02 And I was just like, but, so I had to, again, I got the, also, also as a Christmas present.
01:54:08 I asked my, my parents, they were like, what do you want for Christmas?
01:54:10 And I was like, well, I need a Blu-ray burner.
01:54:12 And then later I knew it was like, also I need a printer.
01:54:15 Ben, I told you I was just buying you a new one.
01:54:18 I didn't want you to buy me another one.
01:54:20 That, that sucks.
01:54:22 It was only like a hundred bucks.
01:54:24 Yeah.
01:54:24 It was like 90.
01:54:25 So whatever.
01:54:26 I just got one, one disc, one disc and the thing fucking breaks.
01:54:30 That thing is trash.
01:54:32 That thing was so,
01:54:36 has maybe made me really mad.
01:54:37 This is a safe space.
01:54:38 You can be mad.
01:54:39 You can be mad.
01:54:39 You can be mad here.
01:54:41 Modern technology.
01:54:42 There's fucking Chinese swindlers, the shysters that sold that thing.
01:54:48 And they didn't even get, you should get a refund.
01:54:49 You should get a refund on that thing.
01:54:50 Oh, you want that?
01:54:51 Just yell at them.
01:54:52 Be like, hey, you, you sold the thing you sold me fucking broke.
01:54:55 I'll kill you.
01:54:55 Instantly.
01:54:56 It like didn't work.
01:54:57 I'll show up to your house and I'll kill you.
01:55:00 Anyway, I have a question for you, Ben Singh.
01:55:02 There seems to be rumors about the pro and on going on, like how we're dead.
01:55:06 What's up with that?
01:55:08 Wait, what?
01:55:10 There's rumors about what?
01:55:11 About us being dead.
01:55:13 You like just ask, like, hey, are we even alive?
01:55:15 Like, I keep hearing that people say we're dead.
01:55:19 Haven't been paying attention.
01:55:21 I just haven't heard anything about it in a while.
01:55:24 I just haven't heard about it.
01:55:25 Like I know that like you and Sean and Simon,
01:55:28 is Simon a pro and on?
01:55:29 He is, right?
01:55:30 Simon's like dead.
01:55:32 Simon's in our D&D game.
01:55:33 Okay.
01:55:35 Like I know, and like Dune Koon and like I know all these people,
01:55:37 or no, she's not called Dune Koon anymore.
01:55:39 She's, I don't know her name.
01:55:41 She's, I know, I know.
01:55:44 Every time I say anything about Dune, she gets embarrassed that,
01:55:48 her YouTube is still doing Dune Koon.
01:55:50 Actually, she's just got monetization on our YouTube channel.
01:55:54 Nice.
01:55:54 Oh, wow.
01:55:56 I mean, I know you guys are still around.
01:55:58 I just haven't heard anyone mention the pro and on cast in a while.
01:56:01 So I don't know.
01:56:02 Yeah, we just, we're just a friend group now.
01:56:07 That's fair.
01:56:08 Talking about the PCP, nearly tore our friendship apart.
01:56:11 And we're like, we don't want to be that much like the PCP.
01:56:13 Yeah.
01:56:14 We don't want to.
01:56:15 Being the procrastinators tore our friendship apart as well.
01:56:20 Yeah.
01:56:20 So we're like, let's just stop reviewing the PCP.
01:56:24 Let's just make things when we have something to say.
01:56:26 Don't want to go the way, you don't want to go the way of the PCP.
01:56:29 You don't want to follow us over that, over that cliff.
01:56:32 Yeah.
01:56:33 So instead we just hang out.
01:56:35 We play D&D.
01:56:37 We play video games.
01:56:39 We're going to be playing Magic soon, I hope.
01:56:41 I'm trying to coerce them into playing Magic with me.
01:56:43 It's going to be great.
01:56:46 Yeah.
01:56:46 We're just having fun.
01:56:47 We're just a group of funny little guys having a good time.
01:56:52 Yeah.
01:56:53 Yeah.
01:56:53 It's great to be a funny little guy.
01:56:56 It's a great world to be a funny little guy.
01:56:58 And we're just having fun.
01:56:59 We're just having a good time.
01:57:01 Well, what's up?
01:57:04 Are we done?
01:57:05 Do you want to wrap up?
01:57:08 I guess so.
01:57:09 I'm winding down mentally.
01:57:13 I think we have a draw cast today, the Femboy episode.
01:57:16 Yeah, we do.
01:57:16 I have to go run and see my uncles.
01:57:18 So I have like-
01:57:19 Make a message gothic to see if she's still ready for that
01:57:23 and then find out who the other artist is going to be on that one.
01:57:27 Right.
01:57:28 Yeah.
01:57:28 Check out the draw cast.
01:57:29 Hey, Daniel, spend more time with us.
01:57:31 Then you want to spend more time with us.
01:57:33 Trying for Femboy.
01:57:34 Not today.
01:57:35 Not today.
01:57:36 I'm busy.
01:57:37 I'm busy.
01:57:38 I'm looking forward to another week of furiously typing away in GML
01:57:43 to add features that nobody asked for and are not necessary.
01:57:49 But they fill out the menu and they make the game ha ha funnier.
01:57:54 We could have all drawn Ben St. with tits.
01:57:56 It could have happened.
01:57:57 Oh.
01:57:57 I just want to be left alone.
01:58:00 I just want to be left alone to my own devices to do that.
01:58:03 You want Ben St. with tits, you say?
01:58:07 Here.
01:58:08 Here, let me give you up Ben St. with tits.
01:58:12 We already got one.
01:58:12 We already got one.
01:58:13 Oh, no, this is a new one that I made while we were talking about it
01:58:16 because I thought it'd be funny.
01:58:18 Oh, no.
01:58:19 Demand is sky high.
01:58:21 Production is infinitely low.
01:58:23 I just thought it'd be funny.
01:58:24 You know what?
01:58:25 It was funny.
01:58:27 Let me get it.
01:58:28 Wait.
01:58:29 Okay, I was going to say I don't see anything.
01:58:31 No, you don't.
01:58:32 Get it.
01:58:33 Because I haven't put it up yet.
01:58:33 Because I forgot what you looked like.
01:58:34 Don't stop. Get it, get it.
01:58:36 It's all your captaincy in here.
01:58:38 Oh.
01:58:40 Oh, my God.
01:58:41 Just constantly shoveling them into the mouth.
01:58:43 Incredible.
01:58:44 The boobs, these boobs are way better.
01:58:46 These boobs are way better.
01:58:47 Yeah, those are closer to ideal.
01:58:49 They're chunkier.
01:58:51 They're getting bigger by the moment.
01:58:52 Yeah, closer to ideal.
01:58:54 You're getting the Oda treatment.
01:58:57 Closer, we're 5% better.
01:58:58 You're being bimbified as we speak.
01:59:02 You know, this is what we need.
01:59:04 This is the prejudice that we face,
01:59:06 that we big booby women face in Hollywood.
01:59:08 Just because our breasts are big doesn't mean we're slutty.
01:59:10 Doesn't mean we're bimbos.
01:59:11 Doesn't mean we're not intelligent or talented.
01:59:14 Doesn't mean we can't be leading ladies
01:59:16 in major motion pictures.
01:59:17 And it definitely doesn't mean that you can talk to me that way.
01:59:21 You fucking scoundrel.
01:59:23 It is a very, very real prejudice.
01:59:25 I follow some very, very big breasted women on Twitter.
01:59:29 And all of them have made poise at various points about,
01:59:31 like, they can't ever wear a low-cut top
01:59:35 or without, like, mothers covering their children's eyes
01:59:38 when they walk past.
01:59:39 Even if they just wear normal clothing,
01:59:42 like, have to wear excessively baggy clothing
01:59:44 that disguises their form.
01:59:46 Otherwise, they'll get dirty looks from everyone.
01:59:48 Like, oh, how dare you be out in public
01:59:51 with your obscene body, that sort of thing.
01:59:53 And I think that's really disgusting
01:59:55 that people don't like that.
01:59:56 Them saying shit like, how dare you come out there
01:59:59 with that, that erotic body is like,
02:00:02 that's porn dialogue.
02:00:03 What the fuck?
02:00:05 So lewd, so lewd.
02:00:06 I know, like, oh, look at your obscene body.
02:00:09 Like, that is porn dialogue.
02:00:11 But like, that's actually how these people are being tweeted
02:00:13 and it's not a good thing.
02:00:14 It's, they're being judged.
02:00:17 What they don't know is what they're saying
02:00:19 is even more obscene.
02:00:21 Exactly, they're falling into the trap.
02:00:23 I see.
02:00:24 We have to end the oppression of big booby women.
02:00:27 By becoming big booby women.
02:00:29 By becoming big booby women, it's true.
02:00:32 We got a tran- transition.
02:00:35 Bam, we're all big booby women now.
02:00:38 All the gravestones have tits.
02:00:40 That's the Anthony Fantano strategy.
02:00:42 You're actually going to put tits on all the gravestones.
02:00:44 That'd be fun.
02:00:45 No.
02:00:48 Just put them on my mind, that's fine.
02:00:50 I already have too many ambitious ideas
02:00:51 for how the episode's going to look visually.
02:00:54 Yeah, this is why you had to stop being our editor,
02:00:56 because you've worked too hard and you put too much effort in.
02:01:00 And it was unsustainable.
02:01:01 Oh, Ben, like over two weeks ago,
02:01:03 when Eleazar told me who has gone away,
02:01:04 I'm like, hold on, Eleazar.
02:01:06 And I fucking created an After Effects template.
02:01:08 I did some crazy shit.
02:01:09 When you see this episode, when you see what it looks like,
02:01:11 you're going to be like, oh, god, what the fuck did he do?
02:01:13 You're going to be, the audience has already seen it.
02:01:15 They've been watching this whole time.
02:01:17 Yeah, I guess I probably will say that.
02:01:20 That sounds about right.
02:01:21 I saw you prepping.
02:01:22 It's kind of insane.
02:01:24 It's kind of just very funny.
02:01:27 Okay, well, I can't wait.
02:01:28 I can't wait to go back two hours into the past
02:01:32 and start this episode and see what that looks like and be shocked.
02:01:37 Eleazar, Eleazar, edit my reaction to what the episode looks like.
02:01:41 Wait, no, no, I can't see it.
02:01:43 Never mind.
02:01:44 No, it's fine, it's fine.
02:01:45 We haven't been called.
02:01:46 I can't do that until after.
02:01:49 Okay, all right.
02:01:51 What does that mean?
02:01:51 Do you have the technology?
02:01:52 Well, that's going to, well, that'll be pretty fucking stupid, I guess.
02:01:59 All right.
02:02:00 Yeah, let's let's wrap it up.
02:02:01 Let's let's let's put a little bow on it.
02:02:05 Check out the draw casts.
02:02:06 Check out OblivionFall, follow.
02:02:08 Yeah, patreon.com slash oblivionfall, twitter at oblivionfall underscore d.
02:02:14 Me and Dune are making a comic, so go read that maybe.
02:02:17 Link in description, maybe.
02:02:18 Where?
02:02:20 Where ever we post it.
02:02:23 Where ever we post it when it comes out, I'll send it to Oblivion and Oblivion
02:02:26 can put it in the description.
02:02:27 It's fine.
02:02:27 No matter what, Eleazar is our friend and we will sneak the comic link in one of the
02:02:33 episodes at the PCP somewhere.
02:02:35 It'll be great.
02:02:36 Okay.
02:02:37 Oh yeah, you'll need to give me whatever template you use for the video descriptions these days.
02:02:42 Oh god.
02:02:44 Or I'll just copy it from a recent video and just figure it out.
02:02:48 Yeah, that's what I will do is I will simply go to the latest episode and copy paste the
02:02:53 description and then just give you that.
02:02:56 Yeah, all right.
02:02:57 If you want me to do that for you, I can't just do it.
02:03:00 I can't.
02:03:01 Oh, oh, oh, oh, Benny, Wanny, I did so hard.
02:03:03 I can't do it by myself.
02:03:05 I know, I know, I know.
02:03:07 You're so useless.
02:03:07 More porn dialogue.
02:03:10 That's it.
02:03:12 My boobs are too big.
02:03:13 I can't reach the keyboard to control C.
02:03:18 Everyone, everyone watching the episode, draw Ben with big boobs and you'll be featured on
02:03:22 the next episode of the PCP.
02:03:24 Yeah.
02:03:24 Heck, heck, why not?
02:03:26 And then I'll, and then I'll meticulous, all right, I'll draw me with big boobs and then I'll
02:03:29 go up through every submission and I will meticulously critique, I will critique every
02:03:35 boob drawing.
02:03:36 I will, I will cruelly point out what I do and don't like about them.
02:03:40 I will dehumanize them and pick them apart and, and objectify them for the sake of, I
02:03:47 don't know, big booby liberation.
02:03:51 I'm going to de-sexualize them.
02:03:53 It's self-objectification.
02:03:54 By overanalyzing.
02:03:56 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:03:57 I'm going to, I'm going to dehumanize myself in solidarity.
02:04:02 What a true ally.
02:04:03 Solidarity with big booby women all over the world.
