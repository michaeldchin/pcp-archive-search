00:00:00 Hey, it's Digibro here. This big group decompression chamber was recorded by me, Tom Oliver, Best
00:00:08 Guy Ever, and Ben Saint a few nights ago. Originally, it was going to be a decompression
00:00:14 let's play video. The entire thing was recorded set to Ben playing a game called Dungeon Crawl
00:00:22 Stone Soup, which is this really unbelievably complicated and difficult to sort of parse
00:00:32 dungeon crawler roguelike game. We were just watching him play it while having this incredibly
00:00:40 lengthy discussion. Unfortunately, the video component of that was lost. All the footage
00:00:46 of Ben playing this game was lost to the ether, which is really unfortunate because a lot
00:00:52 of what Ben says in this is him reacting to things that have just happened in the game
00:00:57 when he speaks up every once in a while. We also addressed the game kind of explaining
00:01:03 it and what it looks like early on. This game is so esoteric and the visuals are so incredibly
00:01:11 minimal and bare bones and sort of difficult to even parse if you're watching from a distance
00:01:19 as I was while Ben was playing that losing the visuals isn't as big of a deal and most
00:01:24 of what Ben is reacting to he explains since it would not be even interpretable in the
00:01:30 video anyways. So yeah, I don't think we lost too very much. I hope that's the case anyways
00:01:38 and that you'll enjoy listening to this even without the video component, but if you want
00:01:43 to just maybe look at some videos of what Dungeon Crawlstone's Stone Soup looks like,
00:01:49 you'll be able to get an understanding of what we mean when we talk about it in the
00:01:52 few times that we do. But yeah, mostly this is three hours of totally unrelated discussion
00:01:59 about a broad range of topics and it was really fun and I hope you like it.
00:02:05 Hey everyone, it's Radcon2 and everyone else fell asleep before getting the Pleeve and
00:02:11 the Weeb done, so me, Ben St, best guy ever, Tom Oliver, and Digi Bro, we're all up in
00:02:21 his room and I'm showing them my favorite game of all time, Dungeon Crawlstone Soup,
00:02:31 the coolest game ever that I spent a year and a half trying to beat and I'm going to
00:02:35 be playing it and we're going to just... How long is the session of this game? Are you
00:02:40 going to lose a bunch of time? Okay, there's no way I'll win. Winning takes like 20 hours,
00:02:46 so I will just see how far I can get in however long we feel like going. Alright, so in this
00:02:50 game you pick a race in the class and I'm going to go with a favorite, I'm going to be
00:02:54 a gargoyle Earth Elementalist. I bet. Just out of curiosity, you haven't played this
00:02:59 game in a while. Yeah. Have there been major updates? I haven't, yeah, I mean I don't know
00:03:05 what they are, but I'm sure there have been some. Okay. So yes. Ben's plenty loud, we'll
00:03:09 turn that more towards us. Okay. Alright, so I've got my, I've got down in the bottom
00:03:15 right, I've got my equipment and shit up in the top right and my stats here in the middle
00:03:19 is the map. It's black, missing pixels. This looks completely incomprehensible. See, I'm
00:03:25 exploring the map. Wait, you're playing? I am playing right now. This is, this is the
00:03:30 major game. This is the game. This is the game. What the fuck? Emphasis on the gay.
00:03:35 I just have to, okay, I'm going to sort of have my spell situation. I really like retro
00:03:40 aesthetics, but I have my limits in terms of how primitive you can get before I just
00:03:44 kind of feel like- I think we're going to have to lean up, Tom, to be heard. I feel
00:03:48 like this is so old it predates my interest. This is an old ass game that has been continually
00:03:53 in development. It's not even that it looks old, it just is minimal as fuck. It just reads
00:04:00 as archaic to me. I mean, minimal. Ben played a lot of dwarf, whatever. I mean, what, what
00:04:05 era does this make you think of, Tom? I don't know, it just feels like MS-DOS era. It makes
00:04:10 me feel like 95. I'm trying to remember what my- Maybe it's a win 95 port of a DOS game.
00:04:16 Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I'm just thinking of video games that came out in 1995, most
00:04:22 of which are far more advanced than this. Right. Well, that's why I said DOS. I'm thinking
00:04:26 like something that started development in like 89 or something. I got a port to Windows
00:04:30 95 when DOS was like dying. Like Doom was a DOS game, right? Doom was a virtually a DOS
00:04:35 game. I feel like in 95, I played a lot of games that were out long before 95 because
00:04:40 we had a shitty computer. I didn't play any computer games ever again. And we didn't have
00:04:44 a console until, well, we might have had like a Super Nintendo at that time, I guess. My
00:04:48 history of video games was stupid as fuck. Yeah. I actually forget how to cast spells,
00:04:53 which is going to be a real problem for me. Shameful. Wait, what's that? Explain to me
00:04:57 what your role is, what your class is, and how you plan on winning. He's a man made of
00:05:01 rocks that throws rocks at people. Well, I don't just throw rocks. I'm an Earth Elementalist.
00:05:07 So I have a collection. I have, down here, I have 20 stones. I'm going to consume these
00:05:13 stones in order to cast stone spells. Everything you just said. Throw rocks. Whoa, what the
00:05:19 fuck was all that? That was auto-exploring. Okay, I found a goblin. What is this? The
00:05:24 game plays itself. Okay, okay. What is this nightmare reality you've sucked me into? Is
00:05:29 this door fortress too? Oh, I don't even, I don't actually know those spells. Oh my
00:05:34 god, how the fuck do I learn spells? The mouse is just sitting in the middle of the screen
00:05:38 and he doesn't even care. No, I left him. He's asleep. He's asleep. What, the mouse?
00:05:44 Oh, wait. The goblin, dude. Oh, the goblin. Oh, wait, is this picking up the cursor?
00:05:49 Yeah. That's fine. It's no big deal. Yeah, for this game, that makes sense. Okay, I have
00:05:54 to figure out how to learn spells. Well, the meantime, I am out of my dev. Hold on, I'm
00:06:00 going to take the cursor from you for just a second so I can put this. Go ahead. I want
00:06:03 to put this on top so I can see the game because I can't see much of it through you. The audience
00:06:09 doesn't know what I'm talking about but you can have the cursor back. Okay. Spell casting.
00:06:15 I mean, so the main deal with this game is that you're in a dungeon and you get to new
00:06:19 floors and you basically just explore until you encounter enemies and then you just deal
00:06:23 with them and you try to get stronger and level up so that you can face increasingly
00:06:27 hard hordes. Activate a memorized spell by pressing Z. Okay, but how do I memorize the
00:06:33 spell? I assume that the appeal of this is that it's hard to ship. No, no, that's how
00:06:36 I activate a spell. It is very hard to complete successfully. And so there's two main goals.
00:06:42 The first goal is to get the orb of zat and emerge victorious from within the place. I'm
00:06:47 too inexperienced. But that's the bitch way to beat the game. There is a much, much harder
00:06:53 way to beat the game. We just collect every single rune and then you do the same. You've
00:06:58 got to collect 15 demonic runes. Okay, so here I'm coming up on this. Oh shit, he woke up.
00:07:02 All right, all right. I'm going to cast the sandblast. Is this like a roguelikes when you die,
00:07:06 you're fucked? Oh, absolutely. All right. It's a brutal game. It is a roguelike. The mere
00:07:12 comprehension of the game is the most brutal part of it. I mean, there's plenty of text on the
00:07:17 bottom left that shows up to tell you generally what's going on. It looks like it's written in
00:07:21 fucking code. It kind of is. It's kind of the aesthetic. It's definitely going for DOS. The
00:07:25 trend is right now. This is a game for math nerds. Oh no. I wouldn't say math nerds. Ben
00:07:31 does have a degree in physics. True. This seems out of my depth. I'm an art guy. I'm out of
00:07:37 magic. You have to just stab this newt. Okay, okay. There's a certain brand of PC game that like
00:07:43 that that I've seen people who are into that kind of game and they're like a lot of them. And when
00:07:48 I look at them, I see nothing. I literally don't get it. Do you like binding of Isaac,
00:07:54 did you? No. No? Okay, because this is that, but way harder and way more complex. I fucking
00:08:00 love binding of Isaac. Yeah, Ben and I both love binding of Isaac. This seems a lot more like,
00:08:03 like binding of Isaac is considered like a rogue light. I was just wondering if you liked it at
00:08:08 all. It took me a long time to even get a grasp on what the term roguelike meant. I'm going to
00:08:12 explain something that's really interesting. In this game, in this game, you have to eat to
00:08:17 survive. Right. So right now you can see at the bottom, there's my inventory, but then down at
00:08:21 the very, very bottom right, I step over this goblin corpse and I can see that I'm at bottom right,
00:08:25 I'm standing on the goblin core. So I'm going to hit C to butcher it. And now I have meat in my
00:08:29 inventory. And I love to scale. I'm going to do the same to this newt. Okay, so I have meat. Now
00:08:34 that meat will go bad if I'm not careful. So I need to like continually be exploring. This sounds
00:08:40 like Ben describing his everyday life. This is why Ben's good at what he's doing right now.
00:08:45 This is just training for real life. If I'm not careful, it will go bad. I'll eat it anyways.
00:08:49 That's right. All right. Now let me, let me see here. I got to decide which like weapon. Oh no,
00:08:55 I want to be, I want to be, you want to throw your rocks at people. No, no, no. I want to be
00:08:59 casting spells, but I do want to be. Just know that the gargoyle is too dumb to throw a rock.
00:09:04 I played, where is that right now? I played this game a few times on Ben's suggestion and, and just
00:09:10 hit a wall of there being too many fucking menus and buttons. There used to be a thing. Okay,
00:09:15 there are cursed weapons in the game. And if you equip one, you cannot unequip it until you find a
00:09:19 scroll and cursing. Oh, that sounds awful. Well, here's the real kicker about that. Early on,
00:09:24 if you get cursed, you need, if you get cursed with say a club, you cannot equip a dagger in
00:09:31 order to butcher an animal. So if you get cursed with a bludgeoning weapon, you can't hold a
00:09:36 cutting weapon to butcher corpses and you will starve. And you don't know. If only we had another
00:09:41 hand to use something. They actually changed it. They actually, that used to be a thing like you
00:09:46 had to have a cutting weapon in order to butcher corpses. Now they change it. So your character
00:09:50 always has a knife and it doesn't actually stop you. But it used to actually kill you early on
00:09:54 in the game. Pretty interesting. I'm looking for. So to explain in brief to Tom what rogue is
00:10:02 rogue was an entirely text based game. Okay, that was like, you know, something like this, where
00:10:07 you're in a dungeon exploring us. Yeah, but it was, but it was randomly generated each time. And
00:10:13 and it's like, you know, you, you. Yeah, the main point is that if you die, you lose and there's
00:10:18 lots of traps, like you have to try to make it through the dungeon without, you know, getting
00:10:23 killed in traps and losing your weapons and shit and make it to the end. Okay. And so anything
00:10:27 that's like that in any way, which these days mostly means a hard game that you die, you know,
00:10:33 if you die, you go back. Yeah. But like the idea essentially is that each run is different
00:10:37 because you pick up different shit. Right. And it's like, it's usually randomly generated.
00:10:41 Right. Yeah. And so you, you never know what kind of powerups you're going to get on your way to
00:10:45 the end. And binding of Isaac sort of like, like there's, there's a newer genre that people call
00:10:51 it rogue light, where it's stuff that's like, it takes some of those elements, but kind of
00:10:55 yeah, it's a little bit more pick up and play. And binding of Isaac was such a huge hit that
00:11:00 there's a lot of those now like FTL is another one and shit like that risk of rain is kind of one
00:11:06 of those, which I was the biggest fan of risk of rain. Yeah. But you used to be too glitchy to
00:11:12 even play risk of rain is aesthetically beautiful for sure. Yeah, that's true. Mechanically deep. I
00:11:18 have a follow up question that might be open up a can of worms. I'm going to regret, but I'm
00:11:21 going to, I'm going to go here anyway is, is to, to you guys were both involved in this
00:11:27 conversation and I observed. Yeah. Why are you okay with the term rogue like, but Metroidvania
00:11:31 pisses you off. I feel like they're kind of both. Don't look at me. I'm fine with both of them.
00:11:35 Because I, I listened to your argument about Metroidvania and it felt like kind of what you
00:11:40 just said is the same thing with Metroidvania. Like the idea when you say, because I don't play
00:11:43 rogue likes, I do have a very specific concern with that. And it's that he likes two very
00:11:49 different things about Metroid and Castlevania. And he finds the term, you know, the only
00:11:54 muddling, the only real problem with it is the fact that I really love Metroid games. And the
00:12:00 Castlevania games that are called Metroidvania are, I mean, I don't even hate them, but they're
00:12:05 just they're a different kind of game from Metroid where Metroid is really just Metroid has no
00:12:10 RPG elements really. It's just an action platformer where every once in a while you get a new
00:12:15 ability. Most of those abilities are not just for combat. Most of them are for exploration.
00:12:19 Well, there's some of that in some Castlevania. Even, even like the, even the beam upgrades,
00:12:24 you know, like, you get an ice beam, it lets you free enemies to walk on.
00:12:28 Everything has a purpose aside from combat. Combat is very secondary.
00:12:29 Whereas like Castlevania, Ario Sorrow, for instance, has like, it has a leveling system that is
00:12:37 like, okay, I played through about half of Ario Sorrow. And there was one part where I got to
00:12:44 death, and I couldn't beat him. So I ran back to the start of the game, because there's an item
00:12:49 shop there. So I could buy potions. And then I ran back. But in the time that I made that run,
00:12:55 I went up two levels, and I destroyed death. Okay, like I couldn't beat him before. And then as
00:13:01 soon as I gained two levels, I just fucking destroyed him. And the only reason I gained two
00:13:05 levels is just the process of going to the game. RPGs have that quality. I get that 100%. And I'm
00:13:11 totally with you. But my only counterpoint would be, because I think everything you just said is
00:13:16 100% valid. Metroid and Castlevania are completely different games. I just think when someone just
00:13:20 like, well, I mean, in terms of like, how combat works and how progression and stuff works, there's
00:13:26 definitely different kind of mechanics there. But when someone says a Metroidvania, I think,
00:13:31 just like you said in a roguelike, they're talking about permadeath and stuff. I think when you say
00:13:36 Metroidvania, they just mean an open and connected world with a grid-like map. I think that's all
00:13:41 the term really means. Axiom Verge is a Metroidvania, and that describes it. But it also is a
00:13:48 Metroid game. Well, there are some that lean more towards the Castlevania side. Right. But the
00:13:53 upsetting part to me is that I want to play all the Metroids. Would you rather have a Metroid-like
00:13:57 and a Castlevania-like? I would. Would that make you more satisfied? I would even be satisfied
00:14:03 if like Metroidvania can stay. Just also, if a game is just Metroid, just call it a Metroid
00:14:09 clone. You know, like Axiom Verge, if Castlevania didn't exist, there would be no reason to put
00:14:18 vania in the title of Axiom Verge. It's just a Metroid game. If Castlevania didn't exist, well,
00:14:24 sure. It does. I think the thing is, is that I think a lot of people who play Castlevania probably
00:14:29 enjoy that exploration and like progressively unlock the world. And we'll go to Axiom Verge
00:14:34 because of thevania in it. Maybe, but like the thing about Metroid is that like so much of it
00:14:43 is about the environmental design and like learning your way around is like learning about this
00:14:48 world. There we go. There we go. I finally killed the worm that's been dogging me. You're exploring
00:14:55 this alien planet that's got all this kind of personality to it and like there's distinct
00:15:01 worlds in there. You go to Norfair and that's like a fireplace and you explore there and you get
00:15:08 an ice beam which lets you freeze these molten lava things. In Castlevania, there's no connection
00:15:14 between any of the fucking hallways you go down. And it's all hallways. That's not true. There are
00:15:19 clearly themed areas in Dracula's Castle. In Aria of Sorrow? Absolutely. The clock tower.
00:15:25 There's the clock tower and that's like it. It's not it. The clock tower is the only place that has
00:15:30 like environmental challenges in the whole game. I'm not even interested in arguing about it,
00:15:34 but there are definitely different areas with different features. I would pretty much every
00:15:39 Metroid is probably more thematically distinct in terms of its locales by nature of because it's a
00:15:44 castle versus a planet. They are less different from each other. In Castlevania, there's times
00:15:49 where you'll be going down a hallway that's like a courtyard and you'll fight a couple of
00:15:57 skeleton dogs or something and then like a giant Medusa that has nothing to do with the environment
00:16:02 you're in and then you'll go through another door and now you're just in a totally different place
00:16:06 fighting totally different enemies that again have nothing to do with the place you're in.
00:16:10 And I'm not saying this is like makes it a bad game or anything. It's just not like Metroid.
00:16:15 The enemies you fight would be relevant to that spot and it would be like it's about exploring,
00:16:21 whereas Castlevania is really about combat. It's really about the leveling and the hit
00:16:25 sparks and sound effects and the pleasure of it. I absolutely agree. I think again I'm not to
00:16:29 read it myself, but I think the only point that I think the only distinction Metroidvania is trying
00:16:34 to make is it's talking about how the world map is laid out and nothing more. This slug is shooting
00:16:40 darts at me. Now there is one game... He's more than he appears. I will say... I can get behind a
00:16:45 door though and he won't be able to follow me. I will say that Dark Souls I think just is Metroidvania
00:16:51 because it is in every way it embodies both games. In fact it embodies all of them. It completely
00:16:58 embodies Metroid. It completely embodies original Castlevanias and it completely embodies the new
00:17:04 Castlevanias because it also has that combat system. So it's not that I think it's invalid
00:17:09 to suggest that there are games that are legitimately a combination of Metroid and Castlevania,
00:17:15 but like when people say Metroidvania it can either refer to these games that are exactly
00:17:20 like the Castlevania games. Like what's that one called Abyssal City? It's Valdestoria Abyssal
00:17:29 City is a game that's described as a Metroidvania and you play it and it just plays exactly like
00:17:34 the new Castlevania games. Axiom Verge is described as a Metroidvania, but it plays
00:17:39 exactly like Super Metroid. You know so to me there's kind of two genres here that are being
00:17:44 called the same genre. I think it's just supposed to be referring to the way the games laid out and
00:17:48 it's up to you to use like your brain to read one or two sentences and make the rest of the
00:17:51 distinction yourself. Well how am I supposed to know just based on like the description on the
00:17:55 Steam page? There's these really cool things you're probably kind of familiar with them because
00:17:59 you do it for a living but it's called videos and they really kind of clear that up pretty
00:18:05 quick. Further reading is just the only thing. Yeah. But you know what? If you make a purchase
00:18:09 decision based on one word. But I only buy impulse. I'll tell you that. Well then that's a personal
00:18:13 problem and you need that. I do think that I mean I haven't played all these games but I've played
00:18:17 massive amount of Metroids and Castlevanias and to call Axiom Verge a Metroidvania as opposed
00:18:25 to a Metroid clone is kind of just wasting everyone's time. Yeah. Just call it it's just a
00:18:30 Metroid clone. It is literally Metroid. That's what it is. There's no Castlevania element to it
00:18:34 at all. Yep. Well except in the elements that they are shared but you might as well just cut that
00:18:39 out and just say it's a Metroid clone. I think that's what most people mean when they use the
00:18:42 term. And the same is true. I guess that's my point. It's just that the term is a meme and people use
00:18:46 it a lot. I guess. And there's also the game Zio Drifter is also just Metroid and like it was
00:18:53 what made me kind of come to this realization about Metroidvania. It's why it bothered me
00:18:57 because I made a video about Zio Drifter and Axiom Verge and how each of the like it was called
00:19:02 Ways to Clone Metroid and like I at one point I had thought should I call this like you know
00:19:09 like Metroid like different kinds of Metroidvania but then I was like but there's novania. They're
00:19:13 just Metroid games. Yeah. You know and I think someone had even said like in the comments like oh
00:19:18 you mean Metroidvania and I'm like no these are just Metroid. It's just a Metroid game. I think
00:19:23 I still stand by my original argument and that it's just to describe the way the maps laid out
00:19:27 but I will grant you that a Metroid like and a Castlevania like would be more useful than
00:19:31 Metroidvania. You know I mean when I made my video in response the point I was trying to make was
00:19:37 like you're saying Tom that I think what they're trying to convey is that when they call something
00:19:41 in Metroidvania they're specifically describing that overlap. It's the overlap that is being
00:19:46 described by that term which does leave out things. I think it would be fair to keep that
00:19:51 Metroidvania is not a term that has to die but it would be nice if people distinguished
00:19:56 between the two more. It makes sense to me. Mostly like fans and reviewers who just throw
00:20:00 around Metroidvania all the time to describe games. Well we shouldn't we shouldn't we shouldn't be
00:20:05 listening to them at all anyways. You just told me to watch reviews to find out which one. No no I
00:20:09 didn't mean reviews I said like you go to the Steam page and you can watch your video like oh this
00:20:13 is what the game plays like. It's clearly Metroid versus Castlevania versus a mix of both.
00:20:17 I definitely played Axiom Verge because it looked exactly like Super Metroid. I just I just I just
00:20:22 don't I don't even think you on your at your worst would look at it look at the word Metroidvania
00:20:27 like I'm buying this because I saw this word I was doing any more research. I mean there's I have
00:20:33 had plenty of times where I saw the word and then watched the video and then determined which one
00:20:37 you see then you solved your problem but then I got autistically mad. Well you know we all have our
00:20:43 things. What's what's going on here Ben. But there are a lot of people who are very up in arms
00:20:47 about the proliferation of Broglie. I've encountered a unique monster that I've never heard of before
00:20:51 and I have no idea how strong he is. Robin? I don't know what he does. He's gonna steal from you and
00:20:56 give to his god monster friends. He drank a potion and became more agile. See that's over there that's
00:21:01 a magic amulet on the right and I want that but I'm scared of this guy. He's coming for you. But
00:21:05 it's okay because I've just learned a new spell. What is it? It's on a way fast. No it's um I have
00:21:12 stone arrow which is a much stronger version of sandblast. This guy's got a whole fucking goblin
00:21:17 cadre with him and that makes me nervous. Understandably. You know Tom actually now that you've made me
00:21:22 reflect on this I do I hate myself for being up in arms about the metroidvania term and here's why
00:21:30 because I'm realizing that the reason I feel strongly about this is the same reason that people
00:21:35 complain about the term roguelike. It's a reason I hate which is a fear of evolution because there's
00:21:40 people who a lot of people have their niche and they just want things to fit into that niche
00:21:46 and when that niche starts to evolve and no longer have like all the elements they want it to have
00:21:52 then it's like they feel this disconnect from it where other people might like you know some people
00:21:57 might like the rogue lights for the same reason they like rogue but then there's other people who
00:22:02 are like uh it's not actually like rogue it's it's more dumb down you know. It depends on what you
00:22:07 like you what you enjoyed about rogue. I mean it's a lot like and I can make two music comparisons
00:22:12 the the most obvious one would be new metal which is where you know metal the only reason that the
00:22:17 term new metal literally means not metal and it was invented by metal fans because when like Slipknot
00:22:24 and Lincoln Park and all those bands came out metal fans were so mad that people were calling it
00:22:29 metal that they came up with the term new metal so that people would like say like you know this is
00:22:34 not metal because we don't respect it even though like like there's there's certain like okay I would
00:22:41 not consider Lincoln Park a metal band even though there's there's a lot of metal influence there
00:22:45 I think it would be more fair to call them like uh like a metal hip hop fusion as opposed to making
00:22:51 up a term that is clearly intended to slag off the genre like new metal but like I don't fight
00:22:57 segments there's certain Slipknot songs that are indistinguishable from metal there is no
00:23:02 reason they should not be considered metal other than that metal fans don't like Slipknot
00:23:06 and therefore yeah yeah you know and the same goes now for Prague where you know progressive rock in
00:23:12 the 70s there's like a there's sort of specific kind of way it sounds but then with 2000 stuff like
00:23:18 all of it's considered Neo Prague or New Prague like Kohit and Cambry and the Mars Volta and stuff
00:23:24 like that like nobody will just call it progressive rock even though the Mars Volta is every bit as
00:23:29 experimental as any 70s progressive rock band like hang on hang on one second let me let me explain
00:23:34 what's going on right here this Sigmund is really bad yeah he's all he hangs that he's pretty strong
00:23:38 and he hangs out on low level floors it's his character description is specifically that he
00:23:42 hangs out on low level floors because he's a dick who likes fucking with weak adventurers yeah and
00:23:47 those words all in the description dick who likes fucking well oh let's let's see his description
00:23:53 um an elder the elder of a pair of brothers who came for the orb no one knows what Sigmund saw in
00:23:57 the dungeon to drive him mad but his shrewd magical status and wicked scythe and i'll leave little
00:24:00 time for his his what okay this is not what yeah he changed it they fucking changed it let's both
00:24:07 shit i hate when they change things he used to be just an asshole okay anyway anyway so he just cast
00:24:11 a spell on me and confused me which is absolutely terrible and i'm really scared right now so i think
00:24:17 my only hope my best chance is i have all these scrolls that i have picked up and they're unidentified
00:24:21 i don't know what these scrolls do the only way to learn what they do is to either use a scroll of
00:24:25 identification on them or just use them and see what happens so i'm going to just start using scroll
00:24:30 totally at random oh man and just hope that one of them is a teleportation scroll that will get me
00:24:34 the fuck out of here and what are your odds on that oh no i can't i'm too confused you're too confused
00:24:42 he confused me and now i can't do it now you can't read oh he cast a spell and now i'm more confused
00:24:48 oh god just get to the upstairs okay you know if i get up the if i get to these stairs a puff of
00:24:52 flame i'm really fucked that really oh god oh god don't go that way oh god oh oh he's coming for
00:25:00 your butt please hold so close if it doesn't teleport okay can i get up there yes i fucking got away
00:25:07 thank god okay that was that was intense that was the first comprehensible thing that's happened
00:25:12 in this game well i have wanted to take the time to explain all right i think i'm gonna skip that floor
00:25:17 i don't want to fight that guy i want you to on your channel sometime do a playthrough of this game
00:25:23 where you just narrate everything you're doing that'd be interesting maybe i will that'd be pretty
00:25:28 cool maybe i will because so far i have had literally no idea we're talking about like a 20
00:25:33 hour process though yeah i mean he doesn't have to beat the game in one video yeah yeah but think of
00:25:39 all the mid-roll ads you could have on that now we're talking oh dear i don't have enough magic
00:25:47 but yeah so i think i think the people who the people who are calling games like uh like like
00:25:52 ftl or and all that stuff rogue light are just people who don't want their niche to become mainstream
00:26:00 and for those people like like because it's kind of a rite of passage to like be i'm into something
00:26:05 so extreme like rogue you know like right i'm i'm i'm into this thing that like takes effort to get
00:26:11 into and these people who would probably never play rogue who are playing binding of isaac because
00:26:17 it's more accessible like they feel insulted that those people are saying they play roguelikes you
00:26:22 know when roguelike used to mean something so hardcore but digi isn't your criticism of the term
00:26:27 metroidvania uh just contingent on the fact that it it simply is what happened he's oh he threw a
00:26:33 he threw with the goblin at you he threw a goblin at me badass because the goblin thrower
00:26:40 yeah this guy's new this guy's new i'm just gonna i'm just gonna take some potshots at him as i run
00:26:45 towards the staircase yeah that's fair to try and like weaken him for later you were saying oh i was
00:26:51 just saying isn't your criticism of of the the metroidvania specifically based on the fact that
00:26:56 if for you it makes it harder for you to find what you're looking for in terms of you know
00:27:01 specifically metroid which isn't so much an issue of stopping evolution or anything it's just that
00:27:06 it's confusing on some level it's yeah it's just i'm upset at the idea of polluting this genre i care
00:27:12 about okay so that's that i want more metroid and instead i'm getting castle metroidvania and i'm
00:27:18 i'm sort of afraid that like when like for instance uh you highly recommended me shantae the pirates
00:27:25 yes i did and you said it was a metroidvania but then i stand by i started playing it and it is
00:27:31 identical to a castlevania game that's correct that's correct there would be no reason to call it
00:27:37 well metroid well castlevania itself is a metroidvania right yes but that's what he's talking about
00:27:43 if in the same way that i said that if axiom like if castlevania didn't exist there'd be no reason
00:27:48 to call axiom verge a metroidvania yeah or a metroidvania rather this you can call shantae
00:27:53 exactly like there'd be no reason to say it's anything other than a castlevania game i'm gonna
00:27:58 for the term yes ben what's up i'm gonna put on this magic amulet and see what happens let's find
00:28:03 out it's a cursed amulet of inaccuracy that that should be all right that's not that's not the
00:28:08 worst thing in the world it's still not good you know but the thing about shantae though is that
00:28:14 there are a lot of elements i'm just i'm just gonna start identifying shit it's probably a good idea
00:28:18 shantae specifically does contain a lot of things that are quite metroidy specifically you get
00:28:24 you get major power upgrades like you do in a metroid game that increase your mobility
00:28:29 in you know major steps along the game which i would argue are very there's stuff like that in
00:28:33 aria sorrow like you gain a double jump that's true that's true and you gain a little like uh the
00:28:38 thing that slows your descent little wings yeah the bat the bad thing and i'd say there's there's
00:28:42 more environmental challenges i guess we're talking about an issue of degrees
00:28:47 i think the problem is is that you just want to play more one of those scrolls with a scroll of
00:28:50 remove curse so i can get rid of the amulet well just like i feel like castlevania games the appeal
00:28:56 of them is very grindy and i'm not as into that whereas i agree whereas like like like with aria
00:29:02 of sorrow i realized like i made a video about that game ben ben's probably the only person who's
00:29:07 fucking seen it in the world i'd watch that i love aria of sorrow what is it well it's a very
00:29:11 critical critical very critical i will not watch it i just i just drank a potion and turned into a
00:29:17 tree into a tree yes you're fluttershy right now we went there i was i was gone up i was like no i
00:29:23 know that's gay i had to like process what you went by that oh really i'm so far out of wow
00:29:30 that's never gonna leave me i'm in too deep um anyway yeah a lot of my criticism is the same
00:29:37 thing that uh egoraptor talked about about like what the problem is with ever like castlevania
00:29:42 2 and and all the newer castlevanias which is just fascinating it's a game about running back and
00:29:47 forth across the world fighting lots of guys and the reason it's fun now as opposed to how it wasn't
00:29:51 two is because as he put it there's lots of hit sparks and sound effects and your weapons feel
00:29:56 good and it's really crunchy and awesome and you fucking slash these big guys like
00:30:01 it's it's yeah i fucking killed that guy and you gain like a thousand different weapons and a
00:30:05 million different ghost spirits and stuff yeah it's awesome and like you know i played through
00:30:09 like half the game and i just kind of got bored and stopped and then i watched like a video of
00:30:15 someone getting a hundred percent or no you know maybe i beat the game yeah but didn't do any of
00:30:19 the extra stuff because like i remember oh there's so much to do i remember getting really far and
00:30:25 maybe even beating it but then i looked at like a video of someone doing a 100% run and there's like
00:30:31 whole stretches of the castle i had oh so much i hundred percent of that game myself a couple
00:30:36 times there's so much there's all these secret bosses there's a thousand million weapons the ultimate
00:30:40 super mega boss oh and it made me realize that if you were someone who played this game in such a
00:30:45 way that you just kind of casually wander around and fight shit like forever and like tried to do
00:30:51 all the secret stuff it's a totally different game from the game that i was trying to play yeah
00:30:56 which is i'm fighting a snake right now one is kind of blow through one of the best perks of
00:31:00 being the gargoyles that i'm immune to poison so this guy is not that threatening oh actually he's
00:31:04 he's doing some kind of bad damage i don't like that i don't like that wait what's happening again
00:31:08 he's fighting a snake he's made of rocks so we can't be poisonous he's poisonous though he's a
00:31:12 poisonous serpent he's hitting hard dude i'm just gonna drink this potion of might a lot of the
00:31:18 castlevania games are our best played from a completionist standpoint and i got a lot of
00:31:25 enjoyment out of them doing it that way i mean i've i've i've been asked about this on these shows
00:31:29 before like why am i so bad at video games and why do i never beat them yeah and the reason is
00:31:35 that i with any media i am extremely impatient about it because i want to consume it and move on
00:31:42 yeah like i always feel anytime i i'm like working through one thing i feel like it's distracting me
00:31:47 from other things that i could be doing like like you know i just want to make a video i just
00:31:51 want to go do something else and and work through all this different stuff so when it when something
00:31:56 takes more than a couple days i get really antsy about it and i don't even if it's like even if
00:32:01 it's amazing you know and there's very few times like dark souls 3 is one of the only games that
00:32:06 like i beat it in two days and then i immediately started playing again you know i immediately
00:32:11 went on new game plus and made another character uh i beat it in a different way you know like i
00:32:16 think i beat it twice there's an altar either beat it twice i got most of the way through in a
00:32:20 second there's an altar of sif muna here sif muna is a pretty good god for a spellcaster but i'm more
00:32:25 i'm a sif muna is a god who just gives you lots of access to lots of spells cool i don't want to
00:32:31 worship her though because i'm going to worship vehumet who is specifically the god of destruction
00:32:35 magic he doesn't give you access to as many spells but he does like power up your destructive spells
00:32:40 and reward you for destroying things with magic so i'm not gonna i'm not going to start worshiping
00:32:45 sif muna can you is there anything you can do to unworship if you start worshiping someone
00:32:49 if you start worshiping someone you can renounce your religion but your god will um declare you
00:32:55 an affustate and curse you and take divine vengeance on you until they eventually like just
00:33:01 forget about it and they're like well whatever it's that's enough i see except for except for the
00:33:05 good there's three good gods well whatever that's enough there's three there's three good gods who
00:33:10 won't take vengeance on you unless you join an evil god and then their wrath will fall upon
00:33:14 how dangerous is the auto explorer you keep doing oh it's not dangerous at all because it stops when
00:33:19 literally anything of note happens yeah it's great so it just saves you time yeah digi i was gonna say
00:33:25 i think that's interesting how uh we we consume media differently because even just today i went on
00:33:31 a crazy tirade of cleaning the entire lower half of this house because i felt compelled to to make
00:33:36 sure it was all done and even when others told me to stop i simply could not bring myself to do so
00:33:41 i had to follow it through to the bitter end and uh yeah i just think that's all right the way we
00:33:47 play why are they telling you to stop well tom was cleaning i just felt so guilty he was cleaning
00:33:51 up all of our dishes as was victor as was victor and victor here's the thing victor and tom both
00:33:57 have the same kind of guilty conscience uh of like like if no one had done it that would have been
00:34:04 like like they would have felt a little guilty because they wanted it to get done but as soon as
00:34:08 someone's doing it it's like well i should have victor specifically mentioned that yeah it's my
00:34:12 good Samaritan nature like fighting against my inherently this is actually horrible i'm trapped
00:34:17 between nobles and a snake i just i mean if i was the snake i guess to me it's like well you guys
00:34:24 obviously wanted it to be clean more than i did because if i actually didn't want it to be clean i
00:34:29 would have cleaned it right well i'm not i don't even care about that the the point was just that uh
00:34:33 i i play games the same way i tackle other tasks because i do it as fast as i can as hard as i can
00:34:39 but it's the exact opposite you're a quantity and you're a quantity guy yeah quality quality yeah
00:34:44 yeah that's true yeah i mean this is true of everything okay check out these pro straps i'm
00:34:48 gonna try and use passwall and just like pass through a wall all right do it i have like never
00:34:53 fucking done this before you're a rock guy that's why you can do it right yeah passwall lets you meld
00:34:58 with stone oh you're like pika from one piece i like i like never use this okay this it's uh c
00:35:04 okay so z this is exciting c i feel like if this has not worked this did not work wasted my mp
00:35:12 damn okay okay i feel like if this had like more like advanced graphics i'd be totally enthralled
00:35:17 right now you guys are a bunch of babies this is fucking fascinating i'm completely no no no i'm
00:35:21 i'm enthralled but i just feel like it'd be some of this i don't know you guys are cowards is what
00:35:26 you are god damn weak cowardly i play fucking dungeon dragons or have my imagination yeah that's
00:35:32 your problem i can step on computer science major that's why i'm interested yeah i gotta scroll
00:35:36 of teleportation if i can survive for a couple more rounds i'll be safe the shimulinsky family
00:35:41 yes oh he won't let down a family of science a family of science that's true even though you're
00:35:46 both artists now you approach art from like you're the kind of guys who would make a game like this
00:35:52 that's true me and tom would probably make a game that looked absolutely beautiful and played
00:35:56 like generic dog shit some of the games i've made exactly i'd rather take the little more travel so
00:36:01 i can focus on making it look cool exactly the game i was trying to make uh with my buddies before i
00:36:06 started tbap which actually we stopped working on the game uh to work on tbap stuff man horses
00:36:12 ruined our and the world and the world was robbed and the world was robbed of this game where we were
00:36:16 playing as i was working on a 3d animated series with my friend before this was a this was a 2d
00:36:23 technical platformer that was all about being synced to music and we had the engine running
00:36:29 properly what and and basically is this the game you played is that a different game no totally
00:36:34 different game totally this was one we constructed ourselves out of unity instead of using rpg maker
00:36:40 yeah it was fairly pro you considered suing crypt of the necro dancer for stealing your concept
00:36:45 they kind of did steal our idea a little bit but ours was a 2d platformer instead of like a dungeon
00:36:49 crawler there's is a roguelite incident it is a roguelite it sure does let me just say i fucking
00:36:54 love uh crypt of the necro dancer that's the game on my list to play that is i never played games
00:36:59 anymore i don't yeah me neither but that one is really as you sit here playing by the way i just
00:37:03 want to take a moment to point out how ben's survival in that situation is is fairly pro
00:37:11 shit thank you ben says he doesn't play a lot of games but in the time he's lived with me he's
00:37:15 played more games than i have in like the last three years it's about how you approach things i
00:37:20 guess okay pokemon is not i don't view playing pokemon as a part of his life i don't play that as
00:37:25 playing what about just the the amount of prep work for the pokemon contest the well yeah that
00:37:31 again again that doesn't feel like playing a game to me well i mean it is objective okay shut up
00:37:37 it doesn't it doesn't feel like it though oh oh god oh sweet a published name invisibility
00:37:45 wasted i don't know yeah i don't oh crypt of the necro dancer i am right right i was re-watching
00:37:52 my end of 2015 video like stuff i loved in 2015 the first thing i commented on was crypt of the
00:37:58 necro dancer and i described it as uh um the game i've spent the most time playing out of all games
00:38:04 that i'm absolutely terrible at because i was never able to beat like like like the third floor of
00:38:10 the first dude i couldn't do that either it was too fucking hard yeah it's i mean i played for
00:38:14 probably 13 hours oh wow like the third floor that was that guy there that sings to your music right
00:38:21 yeah you can put in the middle of that that is probably a hard game i can actually get to read
00:38:26 a limel yeah it's my problem right now who is a god no kiko bakuga who's the god of death magic
00:38:32 specifically okay but i don't destruction not yeah yeah he's not yeah i want to subtle difference
00:38:37 that who meant the god of blowing chip up up with fireballs and such are you gonna be a still
00:38:42 an earth guy are you gonna switch to i yeah yeah i well i am gonna branch out a little bit like i'm
00:38:46 gonna learn magma bolt as soon as i can okay but uh which is fire earth cross class but um i am gonna
00:38:52 i am gonna specialize in earth the whole game okay what's your problem with uh trying to get
00:38:58 well it's not even blood just because gargoyles are really good at earth is that because i'm
00:39:02 like so self-critical when i die in a game i feel like that's a personal failure when you when you've
00:39:06 died in a game do you feel like you die for real a little bit inside yes every time every time
00:39:12 every every death in a video game is is a personal blow to my ego because i shouldn't i if i was
00:39:17 better i wouldn't have played a game like i want to be the guy that game will make you i don't want
00:39:22 not give a shit about dying a thousand times okay that's true i can leave rapid deconstruction
00:39:28 is a great fucking spell but right if i learned it right now the failure rate would be really high
00:39:33 and it's a pretty powerful spell so if you miscast spells really bad things can happen you can get
00:39:38 contaminated with magical energy that can actually mutate you like physically mutate you that's the
00:39:44 good thing about simple games like this is that they can implement crazy concepts without having
00:39:48 to like yeah that's where there's so much better than bullshit big budget shitty 3d games the first
00:39:54 time i ever won this game i was a crusader of oh i was a merfolk crusader and the reason that i won
00:40:02 was really early on i found an altar to the slime god whose name escapes me and all through the slime
00:40:07 god all through the game these slimes were always following me around they spawned on every level
00:40:12 and ate all the equipment like so like i didn't get any good drops because the slimes would eat all
00:40:17 my shit but the god would continually just fuck with me and mutate me and like by the time i like i
00:40:22 got the orb and i crawled out and i crawled out like i was colored in like iridescent scales and i
00:40:27 had like glow like glowing gold extra eyes like poking out from under my skin and i had extra arms
00:40:33 and shit it was fucking around do you win the game yeah like some of those were good like the extra
00:40:38 eyes give you an accuracy bonus and stuff like that fuck yeah so sometimes they're bad all right
00:40:43 well you convinced me this is the coolest game ever made it is yeah it is the coolest game ever
00:40:47 this is like if dnd were fun and good yeah you could play dnd by yourself and you didn't have to
00:40:51 worry about oh dear so much are you fucked no wait yes oh god the coolest game ever that we're
00:40:58 gonna have to restart right now um are there no save states that's a fickle mistress of course
00:41:03 that's for pussies never i've never played rogue or any rogue like so well just know you are not
00:41:09 no one's played rogue like no one has actually played rogue well i'm gonna be the first the reason
00:41:14 that rogue like has proliferated as a term because everybody wants to play rogue without playing
00:41:19 no one's played rogue everyone's played i mean there's a whole like the thing is this this is
00:41:24 really these should be called mystery dungeon games to me because that's what they're called in
00:41:28 japan there's a gigantic like you know pokemon mystery dungeons that's just a spin off of like a
00:41:33 huge fucking thing yeah but there's there's like well there's just a thousand games that are like
00:41:37 that because there's i mean there's dungeon crawler games and then there's like tons it's the word is
00:41:41 nariki dungeon so like there's there's like there's tons of games that are just spin offs of other
00:41:47 franchises that are just mystery dungeon versions of that franchise and then like and then there's
00:41:53 just like a million of them and they're like uh izuna legend of the unemployed ninja my sister was
00:41:58 a big fan of that i i fucking she bought it because there's a cute ninja on the cover well and i
00:42:04 bet you did too my friend i bet you did you gotta understand man oh i understand izuna legend of
00:42:09 the unemployed ninja is a game that i saw in the store yeah i'm unemployed and i want to be a ninja
00:42:15 i was immediately i was immediately the most captivated i've ever been with anything in my life
00:42:20 because that's so it's okay it's this ninja what the fuck tits and pink hair and she's got a big

00:42:50 don't join that dark carnival just sit ben okay i don't know usaka the reveler is a god of ecstatic
00:42:55 dance oh my god uskaya appreciates many forms of worship but in the dungeon most worshipers
00:43:00 stick to the dance of combat uskaya appreciates the passion rhythm of combat rewarding followers
00:43:05 for each strike they deliver and for the damage they deal their foes the longer the dance continues
00:43:10 the greater the path okay so it seems like he's like a melee god he's like a melee combat guy all
00:43:14 right that's cool so i'm not i'm not gonna join him pretty fun i that's awesome just like you get
00:43:20 up you don't say any prayers we just give him a nice nod and like a thumbs up as you walk away
00:43:25 the carnival you want about izuna the unemployed ninja yeah god so yeah i saw this game and it was
00:43:31 so beautiful and captivating because it's called the legend of the unemployed ninja so i was like
00:43:36 this is the greatest name ever of a game plus four plus four ring of intelligence just put it on
00:43:40 perfect for you feeling good going good i desperately need one of those so oh yeah dude i didn't buy
00:43:46 the game immediately because i looked at the back and it's like you know these very simple pixel art
00:43:51 kind of graphics and i was like this looks like it's probably a pain in the s rpg tactics game
00:43:56 or something uh so then i i i read reviews of it and all of them just assured me that the game is
00:44:01 hard as fuck because it's a dungeon crawler they're all hard as fuck um so i was like okay well i'm
00:44:06 probably not gonna play this because it's it's too hard uh and then it but i but i always wanted
00:44:10 it every time i was in the store i just never had the money for it and then they made izuna
00:44:13 to the unemployed ninja returns and that was always in the store and i was like i fucking want this game
00:44:18 still unemployed um yeah i don't want to factor this girl so bad and well here's the other thing uh
00:44:23 do you guys know about the character bico who's that okay she's a character who's famous on forechan
00:44:30 probably know her then she's she's got um she's got white hair and an eyepatch and she's the one
00:44:35 they made the comic for yeah this is the same b she's like five times yeah yeah she's missing an arm
00:44:39 and a leg and she plays guitar and anyway yeah i don't know tom knows the story i tried to get a
00:44:45 comic made of her but the artist who drew her is the same artist who drew the izuna art oh yeah so
00:44:49 me being a fan of bico also compounded my desire to buy izuna at this point i i need to remember
00:44:55 this part of the story yeah so i finally bought izuna 2 the unemployed ninja returns and i played
00:45:01 like 10 hours of it and it was too fucking hard so i'm gonna die i'm gonna die the terrible end
00:45:06 to that story of passion what's happening what's happening the fucking bee caught up to me i can't
00:45:11 run him i died bee you died that same bee that same bee got me a bee yeah well like a magic
00:45:18 bee i assume this mighty gargoyle was felled by a bee he's probably big he was a red bee no this
00:45:24 was you don't understand this was a red this is like a red bee like in donkey con they're invincible
00:45:27 you can't kill him so you know all right i'm just gonna fucking i'm just gonna rush through
00:45:32 and he'll understand this is a big bee really big guy well we're on run two now all right well you
00:45:39 know like you got yourself out of a lot of sticky situations so i'll give you props for that this
00:45:44 game is all about sticky enough to escape the honey though this game is about threat management yeah
00:45:50 as you're crumb across this game is about never taking any risk i feel like as you will deal with
00:45:55 so much shit in this game that if you even take risks that have a one percent chance of killing
00:45:59 you eventually you'll take so many of them that they'll kill you i feel like this is this is a
00:46:03 captain Picard game which is why it's a good game exactly you know what like a game he would enjoy
00:46:08 but he'd be good at i feel like he'd be good at it like he takes lots of risks though oh yeah but
00:46:14 you have to take risks to survive in this game so you know of course you would but yeah you do have
00:46:18 something there never need to say where you have to be adamant in your assertion that there are only
00:46:22 four lights that's such a cool scene it is a great scene there don't think i've seen this shit man
00:46:28 oh it's a good one oh i think i'm gonna die to this cockroach i feel like to explain it would be to
00:46:32 really die at least at least right away i barely survived i barely survived the cockroach all right
00:46:37 wow well that's a sentence i've said many times in my life and completely meant it
00:46:45 yeah and the thing about izuna too is that while it was hardest shit yeah it also just is like it
00:46:52 didn't have as much story as i would have liked like it's the kind of game kind of like uh like
00:46:57 diskaya or the niponichi games what always shocked me about those games is that like you'd go through
00:47:02 this gauntlet of like hours in a dungeon like this long incredibly hard dungeon that takes you like
00:47:08 fucking 50 tries to beat a level and then you beat it and you get like maybe three minutes of cut
00:47:14 scene that's mostly characters just saying dumb shit and the story makes no progress and then
00:47:18 you're right back in another dungeon that always frustrated me immensely about that yeah like
00:47:22 because i was used to you know rpg's like final fantasy 10 yeah you know good games yeah we're
00:47:28 gonna sit down for a fucking yeah yeah it's funny because some people like there's a lot of people
00:47:33 who really hate like the final fantasy games because of this reason that there's so much
00:47:38 cutscene but like to me i was kind of conditioned i grew up with those games and i like this condition
00:47:43 to expect that if i just beat a giant boss i'm going to get a sizable chunk of story for payoff like
00:47:49 i did not play those games because i thought it was fun to fight bosses the people who hate final
00:47:53 fantasy probably people who grew up playing stuff like dagger fall which is like the exact
00:47:56 opposite yeah it's a huge fucking big world well meanwhile like the make your own story essentially
00:48:01 the nipponichi games like the reward for that is some snarky dialogue and then they waste like 15
00:48:05 minutes of your time with bullshit conversations no one gives a fuck about and granted i like i didn't
00:48:10 get this at the time and god i fucking i bought an amulet of faith now that's not that might that
00:48:16 might really help me that'll really help me if i can survive to fucking get a god this time yeah
00:48:21 i makes gods really like you that's sweet i fucking i fucking bought like every nipponichi game
00:48:26 they released here because because i i the aesthetic appeals to me so much yeah like i'm so oh they
00:48:33 look so good dude that's so that's the disappointing part because you get drawn in for the aesthetic
00:48:37 and they don't really do anything with well i was also i'm gonna just like make you bought the game
00:48:41 i was also way into that was for i was full full heartily this is this is pure hubris pure
00:48:48 pretension and hubris yeah i was from well yeah i don't i don't think of myself as being
00:48:55 that pretentious because pretension means you're pretending to be something other than what you
00:48:59 are i am a leader on with your body i am elitist and biased but i don't think i'm pretentious but
00:49:05 as you don't you don't make any excuses this this was a matter of pure pretension that i was really
00:49:10 into tactics games the only reason i was really into tactics games is because i thought that because
00:49:16 i'm smart i should yeah i told i totally get that i'm smart dude i thought i was wicked smart
00:49:21 like i'm looking all the i'm feeling like playing chess for years over here exactly with all these
00:49:25 old anime boys like i i think the first one i played was probably fire emblem and i sucked at
00:49:30 it i could never beat level 15 uh x uh and like because you know i would restart if i lost a guy
00:49:36 so me too i just played the level like a hundred times i couldn't beat it and said fuck it and
00:49:40 just because i'm literally not smart enough to think of a fucking whoa whoa whoa i just drank
00:49:45 a potion of beneficial mutation my fingernails lengthened and now i feel fantastic is that like
00:49:52 a combat bonus i've done that before it is um i yeah i think it would give me a bonus to unarmed
00:49:59 combat so it's like it's a really small but hey that's zero point two points of death
00:50:05 yeah like i might be able to make off hand attacks like it's like make super power in that episode
00:50:10 of family gather they all got super powers you got the girls grow yeah yeah oh i remember that
00:50:17 but yeah so like over the course of like five or six years i really had it in my head that i was
00:50:21 way into tactics games it would buy like all of them and then play them for like barely any time
00:50:27 because i was so bad yeah you know i think the one i played the most of was the original diskaya
00:50:32 and then like but i had phantom brave makai kingdom fucking lapus l tactics all the way that one
00:50:38 that one sucks that one sucks shit uh i tried so hard to play that game for so long i thought that
00:50:45 it only sucked because i was not good enough and then i grew up like there was a time that is the main
00:50:51 girl was so hot the main girl lapus l tactics was like my my skill and my my personal preference
00:50:59 dude where does that divide it's super hard to find sometimes well the thing about lapus l is that it's
00:51:03 it's the the way that the combat system works takes forever like i don't remember that like you
00:51:10 have this okay it's all based on positioning where you have to like basically uh there's like a line
00:51:15 of colored blocks i do remember that and remember that like your character stands on that line and
00:51:20 whichever way they're facing the line faces that way yeah right like if there's a line cutting
00:51:24 vertically through the stage you'd have a character standing in it and turn them to the left and the
00:51:27 line breaks to the left right and so you want to position all your characters in such a way that
00:51:34 yeah you want to position them all in such a way that you get as many enemies in in this line as
00:51:38 possible and then when you attack it'll go down the line and hit all the guys but then like there's
00:51:43 also like uh like cutscenes for like you know hitting someone yeah and those like they load in
00:51:50 and they're slow and they load out and you can't turn them off so every even like the tutorial
00:51:56 battles are like 40 fucking minutes just because of how much shit you have to watch in between
00:52:02 attacking and like you know as a kid i just thought well i'm garbage at this game and i don't
00:52:06 get it so this is a so i so i'll play it later and then like you know like two years ago i busted
00:52:11 it out and i was like i'm an adult now i'm gonna play a lot of self because i love the aesthetic
00:52:15 of this game the characters look fucking great and i put it in and started playing it and i was like
00:52:20 this game fucking blows the characters all have generic anime personalities it's slow as
00:52:26 shit and the tactics are boring and fuck this game i'm never playing it again i really hate
00:52:31 tactics games i i played a lot i play fire only because my friends do i don't even like it i don't
00:52:36 know why i play it i don't think i would like it if i played one today and yet into fire he loves
00:52:40 fire but final fantasy tactics is one of my favorite games of all time and but that has a great
00:52:45 story it has a fantastic possibly the great story in all video games uh in terms of drama as i
00:52:51 understand the tactics system is complex and rich and wonderful as i understand it final fantasy
00:52:55 tactics is like like like the story is on the level of like the wire or game of thrones or
00:53:00 something it's like it's like it's like an epic political just like exponentially increase my
00:53:04 desire to play yeah it's it's have you played vagrant story or do you know it's the same writer
00:53:09 i want to play that they're they're both known for like these this is why i need to start late to
00:53:12 the party i'll have no yeah so i'll do all this shit tactics it would be a great late to the party
00:53:17 especially is a wonderful wait wait wait um i can kind of infer from the name but what is
00:53:22 late to the party uh basically it's an excuse for me to actually do all the things i keep saying
00:53:25 i've been wanting to do for the last like 10 years huh yeah like it's a good name it's all media
00:53:31 it's media that everyone else cares about that tom hasn't gotten to yet right i can i can be the
00:53:35 sole arbiter side of your nostalgia is bullshit or totally valid this is an alter to my club which
00:53:41 just be careful with that just be very careful i would tread lightly i would i would approach it
00:53:47 very from a very casual and um lighthearted opinionated project i would never i would never
00:53:54 deal in absolutes yeah only a sif does that by the way i think that i'm kind of more of a sif guy
00:54:00 the best way to describe final fantasy tactics is like a cross between the real life war of the
00:54:05 roses and berserk that's how i would describe it it's awesome that sounds fucking great it's great
00:54:11 the drama between deletha and ramza is right up there with guts and i think it's really played
00:54:17 final fantasy tactics advance and i was like this must be like oh shit i wasn't a huge fan of that
00:54:21 game well you know it's a little hard to get into it at first kind of wrapping girls were kind of
00:54:25 cool viara yeah oh i played all the uh the other games but uh only the original is really truly
00:54:33 great and worth playing well tactics advance is like i kind of wish this story is not the same
00:54:37 kind of story it's totally different and it's still fun but it's goofy and not as serious and the
00:54:43 game is just less complex and less fun um yeah so all those fucking niponichi games man i it took
00:54:52 a long time to come to that realization that they're not like that like that you're not the problem
00:54:58 yeah that oh yeah that i'm not the problem and that they're not that they just weren't what i wanted
00:55:04 you're into them for the wrong reasons you're looking for something out of them they don't
00:55:06 deliver well jesse's video about fucking the witch in the hundred night was fucking perfect it was
00:55:12 captured all of my problems with those games it was so great that they have these these these
00:55:18 short weird vapid cutscenes and terrible voice acting and then if you like and if you try to
00:55:25 like you like you have to press x to advance the dialogue which causes them to talk at an unnatural
00:55:31 rate but then if you try to like mash x and you keep hearing the beginnings of sentences there's no
00:55:35 winning yeah there's no victory over the cutscenes and a lot of games would do well to to manage that
00:55:40 yeah and it's it's infuriating and it took me a long time to realize it and like thankfully i stopped
00:55:45 buying the games in like 2008 because i was never playing them so like i have i was like i'm not
00:55:51 going to buy any more until i get through the collection i have i did that too la pucelle and
00:55:54 i've got like three disguise sequels that have just sit in a box because i thought i would play them
00:55:59 it never did you you see over there the audience can't see this but do you see how there's one rack
00:56:04 that's just ps2 games i think so i've beaten maybe four of those and the rest of them are i went
00:56:11 through this period where i was really obsessed with jrpg's but i kept buying them and like i kept
00:56:17 like there was a there was a point where i had a cutoff and i said i'm not going to buy
00:56:20 any more until i beat all the ones i have it's crazy you one by one as i try to go back and beat
00:56:26 the ones i have i realize oh these suck like they mostly suck i still love final fantasy nine
00:56:34 final fantasy nine is fantastic everyone loves final fantasy that's one of the final fantasy
00:56:37 nine is one that everyone who sucks final fantasy seven's dick and just like but nine is so charming
00:56:41 well that's fine i mean i haven't played seven so i'm totally biased but like nine just like
00:56:46 tickled me in all the right way there's okay there's two different levels here like there's the
00:56:49 ones that i never beat that i played like five hours and gave up and thought i would do one day
00:56:55 and those are mostly the ones that i came back to later and went oh i only played five hours
00:56:59 because this game is fucking boring whereas there's other games that i actually almost beat back then
00:57:04 and the only reason i didn't is because of shenanigans yeah in final fantasy nine's case i adored that
00:57:09 game it was like the greatest game ever i made it to disc three uh and then natasha the cat has
00:57:16 nine lives you have to you kill her but she just disappears she appears somewhere else on the level
00:57:21 oh is she uh any stronger when she reappears no she's just the same that's kind of cool farmer
00:57:26 uh you can oh she summoned a demon oh well that's that's not good she summoned a demon
00:57:31 the demon oh i'm out of magic the doctor shows okay it's actually bad 1399 with hd
00:57:39 graph i have fucking read reviews for that shit oh no i have stars right now and has 3598 reviews
00:57:46 if it's got good reviews then it's worth it i mean if you like playing on a fucking mobile
00:57:51 well you know i have like a psp or something it's got to be on that i don't psp is gay i don't have
00:57:57 oh the psp war the lions version is i think it's better like if you just want to play it on the
00:58:06 computer i don't know if dude just fucking pirate it or something i guess you like to buy games so
00:58:11 well he's just worried about whether he's gonna play it on the phone or on the computer that's
00:58:14 oh well the whole thing is that like it's one of the i don't sometimes i spend more time on this
00:58:19 a day than i do on my computer i'm not like that so i'm slowly moving i find sitting at a desk to be
00:58:25 very uh limiting not even limiting just like physically uncomfortable these days yeah i don't
00:58:31 get one of these you'll you can't afford one of these never mind oh god you fuck well i mean this is
00:58:38 a five hundred dollar chair you're sitting in bed this isn't the first one he can't afford this isn't
00:58:42 the first time he said that and it won't be the last no so i just come out and check the privilege
00:58:48 and feel like a victim and i've been in this culture that's a good thing that's true that means i have
00:58:53 privilege over you and soon you'll be paying me well the point is i can sit in this chair all day
00:58:58 and it never becomes a problem i don't know like for some reason i like a couple years ago when i'd
00:59:03 sit down at my desk like all right it's work time now when i sit down at a desk i'm like this is so
00:59:07 gay and i just don't want to do anything well just be aware if if you're i mean the music is great
00:59:12 and if you can appreciate the game fully on your phone feel free to do so i might just wait until
00:59:16 like a new laptop and buy it on windows and just play it on that fair enough um which could be kind
00:59:21 of cool it should be given that it's it's due respect when i don't want to over hype it i mean
00:59:27 it's not perfect i'll sell my final fantasy nine yeah and why i stopped yeah i got to disc three
00:59:32 do you remember the part where kooja is the bad guy of course kooja captures your whole party
00:59:37 and he's he splits you into two let me guess you got to the place where you can't use metal weapons
00:59:42 or something essentially yeah you can't use magic that's right he says like i'm gonna send you to
00:59:49 this uh this castle you get to take two people all of andre the castle all of andre you pick two
00:59:55 people but you can't use magic yep and i didn't like process what that meant so i sent zadan and
01:00:04 vivi oh dear that is not a good call both useless uh that's pretty good my zadan had lots of magic
01:00:11 though uh and and and i was like slightly i was like one level under leveled like i'm never over
01:00:18 leveled in these games i'm always like right hang on that doesn't make any sense zadan doesn't use
01:00:21 magic we're talking about zadan yeah i mean yeah i'm just saying i always call him zadane it is
01:00:27 actually supposed to be pronounced zadan but who gives a fault air well air zadane it's supposed
01:00:31 to be air it's not magic so i don't know what the fuck you're talking about well does he in the game
01:00:37 they never pronounce his name i mean i'm with yon vivi that's totally true he'd be useless without
01:00:41 magic but zadane are you sure he doesn't use magic yes okay well maybe he has some skills
01:00:46 he has skills but i think he could still use those i don't remember i don't remember the points
01:00:50 you got fucked i got i got there the enemies were like a level higher than me yeah and i could not
01:00:55 do any well no it wasn't just that i couldn't do anything i literally could not progress
01:01:02 because there was only two rooms in this place and i kept uh i kept having to run away from
01:01:07 battles because i couldn't like fucking kill anything right so i just kept running away and
01:01:11 i kept going back and forth between these two rooms and of course i had saved the second i got
01:01:14 there and of course i didn't keep multiple save files back well i mean because i was just i would
01:01:19 have done the same thing what did i did do the same thing so i got through this for some reason
01:01:22 i would chose tiner because i wasn't done i kept going back and forth between the two rooms going
01:01:26 like what the fuck happens here and it turns out there's like a specific enemy you have to kill
01:01:31 to make the next area open and i literally could not kill it with the characters i had like because
01:01:38 i couldn't level up i couldn't because i wasn't strong enough to kill anything and there's no
01:01:42 way out you can't leave the fucking place yep so it was just like i was literally completely
01:01:48 fucked my save file was done well and i just didn't i didn't have the fucking wherewithal to play
01:01:54 do it i got to the last kudra fight and my memory card got corrupted i lost all my series
01:01:59 for all my games that's tragic that's tragic i've actually my memory card dies twice and it killed
01:02:03 my final fantasy nine progress and my chronocross progress well you know the ending of nine you know
01:02:08 like the good guys win i mean i never felt like great ending i feel i still feel like i've beaten
01:02:13 the game because i grinded a lot so i was crushing everything at that point so i was confident you
01:02:17 still couldn't beat oh you i never got a chance to actually fight it but you would have won i'm
01:02:22 pretty sure i would have i have a question for each of you and i suspect that for a lot of the
01:02:26 answer will be never but how many times have you given up on a game towards the end because you
01:02:32 couldn't beat a boss never because i couldn't beat a boss i don't think i've ever done that
01:02:36 why is this guy so strong holy shit you know i probably have done it once or twice i did that
01:02:40 with final fantasy 12 for a while but then came back and defeated it and fucking raped that game
01:02:45 and it was awesome i just wanted to do that but i my tism is that like at that point i'm just like
01:02:51 i can't let this game be better than me it's not even real yeah like that yeah and i'll just scream
01:02:57 and i'll use racial slurs and i'll snap controllers in half and i'll get so pissed but i'll eventually
01:03:00 do it and i won't even feel good i'll just be like i just made myself die two years earlier from
01:03:06 all the stress i have it i haven't made everything in some cases i give up because it would take to
01:03:12 like okay here's the thing about me as a kid and this is probably also why you guys are better at
01:03:17 games than me because i just growing up i thought side quests were just a waste of time oh you fool
01:03:23 like i did not think that side quests were worth doing or that there was any reason to do them i
01:03:28 was like people only do this if they're fucking like weird or something right like i just well
01:03:32 you're not wrong i just literally well the thing is that a lot of japanese games expect you to do
01:03:38 all the side quests just to beat the final boss like like okay yeah shadow hearts covenant for
01:03:43 instance is a game that i absolutely loved and i played it all the way through to the end and i got
01:03:48 the final dungeon was pretty hard but i was still beating everything in it yeah and then i get to
01:03:53 the final boss and he's just like curb stomping me like i can't do anything to it and i realized
01:03:59 like i i think i looked at a strategy guy there he said i had to be like it's fucking vehumet
01:04:03 it's fucking vehumet time all right i just happened to find an ulcer to vehumet usually you don't
01:04:08 find the god you want until you get to the ecumenical temple but here i am and i found it all right
01:04:13 the game's trying to turn in your favor uh what what did you do the environments change it's all
01:04:18 randomly generated it is all randomly generated but it doesn't ever look like something different
01:04:22 yeah yeah there are different regions okay i've i've just been fucking around in the early game
01:04:26 right now this is like the baseline yeah normal dungeon yeah okay now now that i'm worshiping
01:04:31 vehumet i just got a and a book but it's probably not anything i want because it was next to this
01:04:37 altar of kikubakudga it is kikubakudga's kikubakudga's disquisition on evil and the only spell it has
01:04:43 is pain which is garbage so i won't be drinking it should i drink from this fountain oh oh oh and
01:04:47 sif muna fuck that um should i drink from this fountain of sparkling water sure why not um how
01:04:54 do i how do i do it speaking of old there probably is an answer to sure why not but yeah
01:04:59 i didn't give it oh yeah yeah it can do terrible things to me um i had to do it anyway i'm gonna
01:05:03 do it anyway i just fuck how do i real man boys take risks give a yolo or two of this fucking game
01:05:09 i mean you're supposed to be going on this card but you can't kirk it every now and then to keep
01:05:13 to keep the analogy going um yeah so at the end of shadow heart's covenant yeah i looked at the
01:05:20 guide and it's like you should be like level 67 or something to beat this boss and i was like
01:05:25 level 59 and i was like like because again i didn't like process side quests is like an important
01:05:32 thing i was like so am i expected to just grind in this final dungeon for like 10 hours well no
01:05:38 yeah because what i eventually realized i mean in your situation that's what yeah well what i
01:05:42 unless you want to go on the side quest were not locked locked out in this game and it's actually
01:05:45 pretty easy to travel around because that game is uh basically you go to a bunch of different
01:05:50 cities yeah it's like each city has a dungeon in it but you could travel between the cities pretty
01:05:54 easily um and it takes place in the real world and in the in europe and so i was like i like
01:06:01 eventually it occurred to me oh like they expected me to have done all the side quests to get all
01:06:06 the ultimate weapons for the characters and that would make this boss a cakewalk that's my shit
01:06:11 but like jam i had not you know i had not done so that was like so rewarding and so i just kind
01:06:17 of play zeno saga yeah zeno saga was my favorite that was that game was my jam i got stuck on a boss
01:06:24 10 hours in and gave up dude i did i was right there on my shelf among games i will play one
01:06:30 game zeno saga 2 it's sitting on my shelf i never finished they changed the art style dramatically
01:06:36 and i got super turned off i didn't like the look of it nearly as much exactly zeno saga 2 is pretty
01:06:41 fucking panned by fans but three is apparently a return to form the problem is that three is i guess
01:06:47 a convoluted mess story wise because there were supposed to be six entries and spend 10 years and
01:06:51 they got canceled so they had to do everything it's four games worth of content in one so it's just
01:06:56 yeah you can't you can't fucking quaff from fountains anymore what the shit man oh you used to be
01:07:01 able to like mutate and stuff but you drink this like irradiated magical water but now i guess they
01:07:06 took it out what's a bummer they take out features sometimes so this game just got less cool because
01:07:11 the mutant was like half the intrigue well no i mean there's there's other ways to do it but yeah
01:07:15 you can no longer drink from fountains i guess they thought it was extraneous which it was but i like
01:07:20 that uh that's kind of the whole thing this phenomenon you were talking about about hitting a
01:07:24 wall i actually fucking love it because it gives me an excuse to go do yeah to go do all the side
01:07:32 quests that i've been putting off to that point because a lot of the time side quest those that
01:07:35 will i mean it depends not me anymore but it depends on the game like like okay the most recent
01:07:42 example of me giving up on a game at the very end was persona 2 eternal punishment which i played
01:07:47 about seems like a close to five years ago now and uh the game it's like 50 hours long you know as
01:07:54 as rpg's tend to be and like i do like i love persona like shin megami tense is the the like
01:08:02 still how like how i got over niponichi i haven't gotten over shin megami tense even though i should
01:08:07 because the games are just so perfect they tell you about persona or the all of them persona and
01:08:13 the rest because the aesthetic is just everything i ever wanted like they look exactly what like
01:08:18 what i want they look how you want to look they fuck how you want to fuck but but atlas is infamous
01:08:25 for making extremely hard games so it's like everything about the game is what i want except
01:08:30 that it's so fucking hard yeah and like the persona games in particular i love the characters i love
01:08:34 this the way that you like go back to the same town and everyone has new things to say every time
01:08:38 you beat a dungeon i love that shit right so i'm playing do persona 2 and the thing is that as the
01:08:43 game goes along the story gets kind of retarded and like the second half of the game is just so
01:08:47 much less interesting than the first so in the first half i was doing a lot more like you know
01:08:52 like extra bullshit yeah but then as i get grew less interested in the story then it would be like
01:08:58 you know i just went through this grueling dungeon and did all this fucking shit and then i come back
01:09:02 and i get a cutscene that is not even interesting i'm like oh this fucking blue and then i have to go
01:09:08 to another incredibly grueling dungeon and when that happened i was like but i still want like now i
01:09:13 just feel like i want to rush through this to find out where the fuck the story is going yeah so in
01:09:17 the second half i just started yeah the second half i just started rushing did you see those fucking
01:09:21 orcs i just came i just came up some stairs about a bunch of orcs and an orc priest um priests are
01:09:27 really bad yeah it's this weird shift in proportion where it's like early in the game the story is
01:09:32 really interesting and the dungeons are pretty short but then later on it's like the dungeons
01:09:36 are super long and super difficult and the story is like nothing yeah so i just feel like i'm in this
01:09:40 endless gauntlet when game is doing a yield turn it's not cool yeah and so the final dungeon in that
01:09:45 game um i was so fucking sick of the game like i just wanted it to be over i was i've been playing
01:09:50 for like probably three days and i just wanted it to be done because they're like non-stop for three
01:09:55 days you know and i was like i gotta fucking finish this game and they're telling me like you know the
01:10:00 final boss if you want to beat him check this shit out what this is that altar over there is an altar
01:10:04 of trog the god of rage and for barbarians and stuff this moth in here is a rage moth or like
01:10:10 wait he's called uh yeah he's a moth of wrath so he's gonna like sprinkle his rage powder on these
01:10:15 fucking rats and send them into a berserk fury so i'm gonna get the fuck out of here get out of there
01:10:19 it sounds like the worst day ever it's pretty bad i mean the the rats are not particularly strong
01:10:25 so it's not like sounds bad it could be it could be dealt with dark souls has taught me that rats are
01:10:30 not to be trifled with that's true i don't want to be hard wearing bloodborne i don't want to be
01:10:34 trifling all right one in isolation is fine i got embarrassingly murdered by a gang of rats it
01:10:41 happens i was i was in uh in maybe you feel less bad about your failures in bloodborne if you watched
01:10:46 other new players because well i felt a little better i felt a little better when i watched when i
01:10:50 watched hippo's uh live stream of bloodborne where he was still dying even though he's like
01:10:54 mastered that game yeah all right yeah yeah i feel a little less no one just makes it through
01:10:59 you know and that's your the whole thing is like i never even talked about dark souls until
01:11:03 i started talking to you guys and the first time i heard anyone talk about dark souls was when
01:11:07 gib was saying i just fucking destroyed dark souls on my first time and i died like twice
01:11:12 i was like oh is that a weirdo exception so okay the thing is that hippo hippo played
01:11:17 not only extremely cautiously but he violently overleveled in his playthrough like i think i'm
01:11:23 doing that in bloodborne right now he was so unbelievably OP that he did things in his first
01:11:28 playthrough that i've never heard of anyone doing yeah because he did artorias in his first try yeah
01:11:33 but but he said that artorias he said that he was taking a drink uh like of estes and artorias
01:11:39 hit him and he did not stagger out of taking yeah yeah which means that is like for that to be possible
01:11:44 he would have to be like like 10 times the level that most people finish the game at like he was
01:11:50 so over leveled it's unbelievable that's crazy so yeah i grinded for like four days to get leveled
01:11:57 before i kept playing the game i just felt like that's a good idea it's it's so boring though grinding
01:12:02 that game is grinding is not great in that game it's what in dark i actually i i i saw my tweet
01:12:07 about dark souls i wrote an entire script in my head for bloodborne i was thinking of dark souls
01:12:10 you're talking about bloodborne yeah because i enjoyed grinding in bloodborne really i just
01:12:14 enjoyed i hate grinding in all those the act of playing bloodborne is the appeal of bloodborne
01:12:20 well here's the thing like bloodborne the only reason i can stand playing bloodborne is because
01:12:25 every time you hit something it's like having an orgasm the blood yeah exactly that's why it's
01:12:29 grinding is fun if that if that wasn't there i couldn't play this game i don't give a shit about
01:12:33 that shit i just want to fucking grind my exp and get up as fast as possible do things repetitively
01:12:38 over and over like that it gets numbing like the only like i had this whole like thing planned out
01:12:43 was like because i was i was comparing it's like action games i like that are hard like ninja
01:12:46 guide and a devil may cry it's a different kind of game completely sure like the the appeal of
01:12:51 devil may cry and stuff is like magic how you kill the guy and the the fun in bloodborne is if
01:12:56 you'll kill the guy that's true you don't know if you're going to be able to make it like that's
01:13:00 why you're co-incostrously and like the thrill is like when you have like less than half a life bar
01:13:04 and like you're just kind of getting by by the skin in your teeth well the thing is that you feel
01:13:08 like a fucking winner once you once you're great at the game it shifts to the other one because
01:13:13 like the way that my friends who are really into souls games play it's all about how fucking much
01:13:19 can i gimp myself and still beat this boss i guess you know like how can i play this game at level
01:13:24 one with only shields yes i can that's kind of that's kind of my big problem with with bloodborne
01:13:29 right now is that like in order to like blew it effectively you have to like treat it as a game
01:13:35 and that sounds really fucking stupid and i'm trying i've i've been like thinking about how i
01:13:39 want to make a video about this and explain this concept and i don't even know how to describe it
01:13:42 in words correctly yet is that like i like kind of not passively experiencing a game but like
01:13:47 kind of getting lost in in the the world and the idea of the game like when i played mass effect
01:13:53 like i was in space like i wasn't sitting at a computer playing a game you know with bloodborne
01:13:57 it's like you have to actively be aware of all the mechanics and i don't believe in immersion i i'm
01:14:01 so i believe i'm the biggest boner for immersion ever i'm not immersed i'm not having nearly as
01:14:06 much fun i don't believe in it i don't think it's real i've immersed many times in my life at least
01:14:11 i think i have and i wouldn't trade it for all your patreon bucks in the world you know oh i just i
01:14:16 don't get it okay i traded for a majority of patreon i don't i i wouldn't be happy about it if you
01:14:21 never get immersed in anything then what's the point of experiencing any story i don't i don't
01:14:26 get the idea like i've never had the moment where i stopped believing that this is a story no i don't
01:14:31 i don't see everything in don't believe it's a story you see it becomes so like you just forget
01:14:35 in it you're not thinking about anything else like um when i'm playing something like mass effect
01:14:41 like i'm not even like conscious of the fact that like there's i'm sitting in a chair and i'm
01:14:44 holding a troller it's just like you're living vicariously through those characters and those
01:14:48 events and so it's just like like if someone the only time you remember you're holding your
01:14:53 troll is when someone like bitches at you like oh fuck you have to pause it you know about this
01:14:56 forgetting shit but like uh like when when ace died in one piece that emotionally devastated me
01:15:03 and i couldn't do anything for a few days i mean that's getting immersed to me it's the totally
01:15:07 if that's what immersion means then i've been immersed but like i don't i don't i've never
01:15:12 forgotten that i don't think you ever think it's real when people when people talk about immersion
01:15:17 the way that like they mean when people say like you know i'm not even analyzing it i'm just immersed
01:15:22 in it like that doesn't happen to me i don't have a moment where i don't think about it i don't think
01:15:26 your autism never gonna let you get to that level no it's just like i mean when i'm watching a great
01:15:31 movie i'm constantly thinking about why it's so great i'm always thinking like oh my god this scene
01:15:38 is constructed so well you know i have to like i have to like flip a switch in order to go into
01:15:43 that mode and i feel sad sometimes because i have such a dip like there are times where i'm i'm
01:15:48 seeing a movie and like i feel bad that i'm thinking so much about why it's making me feel
01:15:54 emotions as opposed to just feeling the emotions someone who can flip the switch i will say that
01:15:58 when i do flip the switch and then and i like realize the flaws of something it just makes me
01:16:02 feel stupid for letting myself be so retarded i've had that i've had that before but i'm more
01:16:08 i usually am more devastated by the fact that i can't just feel something unless it is so
01:16:15 unbelievably powerful that it's like with your personality if you could do that you'd never
01:16:20 let yourself do it anyways you'd never be like well i'm just not going to analyze this because
01:16:23 the immersion was so great right well shit i mean you're just saving yourself a step right
01:16:28 this is this is sort of why your brains optimized for your fucking yeah well i keep i keep telling
01:16:33 people like uh i've had this problem that i've been talking about in the decompression chambers
01:16:36 and stuff that like i need a 10 like i am so desperate to watch another 10 because i've been
01:16:42 trapped in this world like like all of 2016 not a single anime came out that i would give
01:16:49 above a nine not one and all i want is a 10 because even a nine a nine to me when i watch it i'm
01:16:57 thinking wow this is executed so well and when i watch a 10 i'm just thinking oh my fucking god
01:17:05 i love everything like and that that that leap i need that like when i watched speed racer for the
01:17:12 first time i wasn't thinking about the like like oh my god it's a ghost of my last character
01:17:17 he's here with a fucking vengeance oh man that's super cool i don't think i can beat it run can
01:17:25 you just say hi maybe do you say the ghost of your own character yeah yeah the one that just
01:17:29 died he's i just saw it but i'm but i'm getting off forget i'm getting out of here i'm getting
01:17:33 the fucking that's pretty cool that's awesome as shit yeah you can like you you just will
01:17:38 eventually have like this is definitely the coolest game ever made yeah i'll say i'm gonna
01:17:42 fucking and now i'm gonna die because there's a fucking ant that did the the the the the what
01:17:48 she's like that right there that would just i don't have anything to heal with can you go back to the
01:17:52 other floor can you go down the stairs the ant will follow me that's so gay see it's it's important
01:17:59 you stairs he's so small take him forever take him a month to get down i'm gonna die i'm gonna
01:18:03 die heal i don't have anything to fucking heal with let's do something i'm dead oh there was
01:18:10 no there was nothing damn it i couldn't i'm sorry i'm sorry everyone i used stone gargoyle
01:18:19 i i feel bad that i just don't grow i just want to make it to level two i haven't even been able
01:18:24 to make it to the ecumenical temple shameful which is like oh my god i'm getting gang bang all at
01:18:29 the gate but whatever whose phone keeps fucking doing that noise mine made a noise just now i think
01:18:34 that sounds like an iphone sound effect so the fact that every your android phone does it is like
01:18:38 sending me into a frenzy it's like only me and munchie have them anyway would it really disturb
01:18:44 you if i had an iphone uh no i just the fact that you don't and it's making iphone noises
01:18:49 is kind of freaking me out that killed me that's fine nope no biggie the first encounter yep what
01:18:54 the fuck don't worry about the the the downsides of random generated levels there there were just
01:18:59 there were just like three dudes they're waiting for me okay i think i'm probably gonna die to
01:19:04 this hobgoblin too oh no oh no i made it okay sweet all right well so so so that moment that he
01:19:10 had just now with the other guy it's unfortunate because i wasn't playing the game and i never
01:19:15 would because i don't understand this game yeah but that was a 10 out of 10 moment for me that is
01:19:19 that which one which one when you find the ghost of your own self oh yeah at no point did i think
01:19:25 about like the possibility why why is that cool or anything like it's just it is so obviously amazing
01:19:31 that that is that's what i that would be immersion for me like not that uh not that i'm like lost in
01:19:38 the world but that like there was just a just sounds like you're so fucking jaded that you need
01:19:42 something exactly i am extremely fucking jaded and it takes something being like like i can't believe
01:19:48 this happened and i never would have expected it and it's like blowing my mind that it's real
01:19:53 that's what it takes to make me like feel anything that's that's not being a youtube man is this you
01:19:59 just that's the downside to your obsession for quantity you're just kind of like blowing through
01:20:04 your wow factor way too quickly it's true and it happened all at once with anime i mean why why
01:20:09 why would you be why would you be satisfied with anything less yeah exactly like anything less
01:20:16 is good but it's just not you know but the thing is that the only way i can find
01:20:23 i'm sorry he's looking one of his old videos the college graduation video i just got a comment
01:20:27 he's looking at a comment i saw i just had to i had to give him kudos for the music choice on that
01:20:31 video yeah great he learned it from watching me all right well but bonita that's not true that's true
01:20:40 that's true um anyway uh yeah you're right that i'm jaded but the problem is that i never find those
01:20:47 10 out of 10s by chance i only find them by seeking them out well and like by watching at this point
01:20:53 i feel like that's kind of just the nature of the beast you've become you i mean you can't watch
01:20:58 everything to try and find those that's digi's goal that's what i've been doing he's like he's
01:21:03 being audacious like the problem is that admire your drive well the problem is that the stuff that
01:21:08 i end up loving the most is never stuff that everyone else loves the most and so i have to go
01:21:12 find them like i can't look at a list dude you know oh my god magic rings it's made of bones
01:21:17 have you find it have you consider that it's finally time what to learn japanese and dive deep into
01:21:23 that whole other cool shit the the level of manga that i will like like i've been saying this
01:21:29 imagine all the light novels you could read that like should have been published instead of
01:21:34 instead of fucking sao well light novels are inherently bad like that's i'm about to disagree
01:21:38 that rule you're you're not necessarily writing a light novel oh i will like if it's not bad then
01:21:44 it's not a light well if you're defining it like that then i think our case is already complete well
01:21:49 well you're you're too old to be a new light novel writer they're all like 18 and shitty that is
01:21:56 like really depressing actually i think about it i'm an old man that can't be right why is there
01:22:00 like some cadre of older better writers we're like well look at these retarded kids making
01:22:05 bank on this shit why don't we get on it my point is that like what is considered a light novel is
01:22:11 like the necessary element of it is that it's a shitty novel it's just like young adult fiction
01:22:16 right i yeah but it's it's young adult fiction that is like deliberately of like like like you
01:22:22 would describe it as a light novel because it is not of the heft of a real well how different is like
01:22:27 a story online from like a hunger games they seem pretty comparable to me they are and hunger games
01:22:32 is terrible so that's exactly the same thing it's entertaining in its own way yeah so i would uh
01:22:39 i don't know a 30-year-old 30-something-year-old american women wrote that two years worth of
01:22:42 semen float in a blopping sound and float endlessly into opera that was not any of the
01:22:46 published versions i don't think i don't think you're gonna find a line that i don't think you
01:22:50 have to be kind of dumb to write a book like like okay or maybe i'm under arrest to make them
01:22:54 i'm like the biggest i used to be like the biggest light novel guy in the world like like when i was
01:23:00 reading them before well because light novels before they became something that everything
01:23:05 in anime is yeah uh i was reading them in like the mid-2000s but nobody knew what they were uh all
01:23:10 that shit right there you see on that shelf that's all light novels is anything worth reading
01:23:15 yeah a lot of it okay well i'm i'm looking for stuff to read boogie pop boogie pop was my world
01:23:21 is that gonna turn me into you because i don't know if i want to go down that road
01:23:26 no i mean if you if you read if you you know you read some of my book a little bit i read a little
01:23:32 i need to read more it's it's like people who like the one the couple of people who read my book who
01:23:37 had read boogie pop were like you just cloned boogie pop like that's all it is okay um because
01:23:44 the well it's like it my book is just boogie pop meets bakano that's like and gunslinger girl like
01:23:49 if you combine those three you've got my book but uh it's not a terrible combination yeah and like
01:23:54 bakano okay bakano great example phenomenal anime um okay you might be explaining a point
01:24:01 i was just about to raise but keep going bakano is a phenomenal anime um the light novel took
01:24:07 four took almost 10 years to finally come stateside it came last last year uh they released it in
01:24:12 only in a 20 dollar hardcover because they knew how badly people wanted it so they released it only
01:24:18 in a 20 dollar hardcover now here's the thing what you have to understand about both manga and light
01:24:23 novels in japan is that they're like five dollars like a light novel is like this this little tiny
01:24:30 fat book that ring of protection of magic baby that they put out in like all right finally getting
01:24:35 stacked i i hope okay okay there's a race in this in this game that is the octopode it is literally
01:24:42 just a sentient octopus nice and it's cannot use like most equipment but the one thing it can do
01:24:47 is it can wear eight magic rings at the same time uh so if you find eight magic rings you're just
01:24:52 fucking you're fucking set because someone captive planet all by yourself isn't that good to get eight
01:24:57 rings well rings are wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait ben what ben i have a
01:25:04 question for professor sains what i can wear 10 magic rings what are you talking about the rule in
01:25:09 dnd and in much fantasy is that one ring per hand that's fucking gay is doesn't make any sense is the
01:25:16 thing in but an octopode has eight hands if you get a mutation with a new arm you can wear another
01:25:22 why is it just counted as one hand they're all coming from the same central appendage um stop ask
01:25:28 jesus two questions anyway keep going yeah so so so light novels in japan are these little five
01:25:35 dollar rinky dink little books that they fucking shovel out and they come out like every three months
01:25:39 like like if you're if you're reading a series speed yeah that'd be nice i mean look i have nothing
01:25:45 but respect for white light novel authors because they're so fast yeah but the stuff they're writing
01:25:49 is fucking dog shit so like like rekkie kawahara for instance you either understand about soren online
01:25:54 and excel world is that each one has at minimum two books a year at minimum both series are running
01:26:02 at the same time two books a year usually they edge towards four books a year okay so he's writing
01:26:08 these like every month to three months okay these are cheap disposable fiction they are meant to be
01:26:15 things that young people can buy you know for the cheap read quickly get the next installment
01:26:20 in a couple months read a whole bunch of them and they come out like constantly the ones that get
01:26:24 made into anime are the really successful ones but there's a ton of light novels they're really
01:26:28 oversaturated in market so there's just shitloads of these crappy little books coming out now when
01:26:33 they release these stateside because the market for them is so small here and there's such high
01:26:38 demand from people who really care about them they jack the price way up so right now the average
01:26:42 price of a light novel is 14 dollars bakano because it was in demand for so long because it's this
01:26:48 niche that people have wanted it for you know all this time 20 dollar hardcover so i bought it
01:26:52 because i had to of course um you know and i was hoping they were gonna like only do that for the
01:26:58 first book and maybe release like cheaper versions later of course not you said you set the standard
01:27:04 on that you jumped on it oh no i drank a potion of mutation well i feel frail my feet thickened
01:27:09 and deformed i feel the magical essence link to my wands what the fuck does that mean i have no
01:27:15 idea what that means that's you expend magical power to strengthen your wands or whatever frail
01:27:21 is terrible cloven feet is actually pretty shitty because it means i can't wear boots okay i need a
01:27:27 potion of cure mutation wow that's that was that that was a good luck with this third run that's
01:27:33 so good that the the real bad thing is the frailty like by the time i'm finding good boots
01:27:39 it's not unlikely i'll have found a potion of cure mutation yeah um boots yeah i mean your
01:27:45 goal eventually is to get kitted out with like a good piece of equipment in every one of your slots
01:27:49 and then your fucking like every game ever made yeah so so anyway i only bought bakano because
01:27:56 i knew i could write it off of my taxes because i'd make a video about this exact concept i'm
01:28:00 talking about but um have you done that yet yeah i did uh i didn't watch it uh it was called
01:28:06 have have manga and light novels gotten too expensive was it on after dark yeah it's on
01:28:09 after dark i'm not subscribed after um if you want to be polluted with videos every single day then
01:28:15 by all means that's why i'm not subscribed uh so it's too much they're all fantastic everything
01:28:20 i've ever made you know anyway bakano i bought this damn book and i started reading it and
01:28:25 it's it's not well written like that's my huge complaint yeah i was so fucking stoked to check out
01:28:32 oh you read it too no i didn't read i haven't watched bakano another thing on my list to do um
01:28:36 but like i really enjoyed no game of life and i was like oh read the light novels they're terrible
01:28:40 they're so fucking i like flip through one in the store i'm like this looks like it was written
01:28:44 by like a five year old yeah and i wasn't sure like is it just translation or is it like they
01:28:48 actually written by retouch because they're written like i said in like three months but here's
01:28:52 by like a 20 year here's what i don't understand okay um because i just recently read the entire
01:28:57 series of animals which is it's kind it's not the same thing but those came out once a month
01:29:03 there's 12 books a year but those are like okay apple gate is a beast they're smaller books but
01:29:08 like the concepts in there are like fucking great like it's one of like the best like books talking
01:29:12 about like the the psychological effects of war which i mean it's this probably better maybe
01:29:17 exaggerate no no it's not not like okay not not like the best ever but like it's like it it treats
01:29:24 it really realistically and like goes into a lot of things that you wouldn't expect for a book written
01:29:28 for that like age demographic it's fucking great that's like the coolest it's the coolest thing
01:29:33 it's i would do not regret spending 60 on all of animals all right that's cool that was well
01:29:37 worth it but it's just like why why can't like a quote unquote i guess like young adult write
01:29:42 something of like just it okay you have to understand as well that part of the thing with
01:29:47 light novels is that they come from they're very edgy yeah a lot of the a lot of the concept behind
01:29:54 them like the people who did it in the beginning we're kind of like no no this fucking priest won't
01:30:00 leave me alone like some people let's talk to you about jesus some people credit boogie pop with
01:30:05 having been like yes got influence light novels to happen like as as a thing right yeah and boogie
01:30:11 pop the whole idea was that the the guy who wrote it cohe kodono um his writing was too weird
01:30:17 no one would publish him because his writing was too weird um he described it as boogie so he decided
01:30:21 to fuse it with pop sensibility hence boogie pop yeah we've heard this a thousand times yeah yeah yeah
01:30:26 i'm explaining to tom who doesn't watch after dark all right i think i i have heard you say this
01:30:30 before well anyway that's not that important i don't think i can do it not here that he tried to
01:30:35 make you know a pop just found a pizza just found a pizza in the dungeon right yeah threats most of
01:30:41 what's unique about boogie pop as a book is not really like that it's a great story it's the it's
01:30:48 the format of it that it's like five different characters each telling their own part of the
01:30:52 story which is you know it's like there's a lot of like gimmick elements to it so it's like it's
01:30:58 basically just like anime characters in an anime story but it's presented in this very obtuse
01:31:04 strange way with like a sort of rambling stream of consciousness writing style interesting and
01:31:10 that's what some like a lot of the early light novels all of them are like these very um outsider
01:31:16 art stream of consciousness kind of shit but like you when you look back on them as an adult
01:31:23 you can feel the fact that you're older than these authors were when they wrote them and you really
01:31:28 feel that like they're not geniuses they are just like writers who gotta start early you know and like
01:31:36 yeah like i read boogie pop now and even though i still really appreciate it and how like you know
01:31:42 where it innovated and how interesting it is like the actual writing is pretty immature and that's
01:31:49 true of like all light novels and the thing is that most of the people who are writing them were
01:31:52 influenced by the old ones and there's just a degradation over time it only gets worse yeah
01:31:57 new light novels are only worse and worse and worse than older ones so if you read a lot of
01:32:02 those ones on the shelf for the original generation if you read new nicoe scene i hear the sound of
01:32:06 rushing water that means there's a special portal on this level that'll take me to like a hear this
01:32:10 game well no it says what it says i hear the sound of rushing water anyway that means i need to
01:32:15 find a portal and get there because there's a secret level um that will probably have a nice
01:32:20 treasures for me read but yeah if you read the writing of nicoe scene or kohe kodono or any of
01:32:26 the people in foust which is those two volumes there that say foust those are like compilations
01:32:31 cool and it was like it was a magazine that existed in japan that was half like mostly like
01:32:37 light novel authors writing short stories and then they also had manga stuff in there and like
01:32:41 everyone in there has like a very distinct like dark edgy kind of teenage like young adult style
01:32:47 but those stories were very like even though they took a lot of influence from anime and video games
01:32:52 they read more like young adult fiction like it was they took place in like you know urban areas
01:32:59 and they had like real stories and some drama but then over time they like light novels just
01:33:05 became anime and it just became like all the tropey bullshit and uh and now they're just garbage
01:33:12 they're all fucking terrible and and it strikes me as odd that that happened why could you just
01:33:17 write fiction for you know young adults and not have it devolved because they're they're they're
01:33:22 being like the problem is that those guys who wrote the original ones were probably influenced by real
01:33:27 books writers yeah right of course like like uh catcher in the rye they all owe a lot to to that
01:33:32 you know they all owe a lot to the catcher in the rye they they even in one of the foust volumes
01:33:36 there's like like a few of them nerd out about it you know really love that sure not be catcher in
01:33:41 the rye is you know is something that young adults love sure you know it's written in a way that that
01:33:47 audience can appreciate it but it's a real book but if you only read stuff that are influenced by
01:33:52 that that's a little worse and then those people are the right you know and everyone keeps writing
01:33:57 worse and worse stuff yeah and if you're writing like i want you to imagine that someone because
01:34:04 this is something that happens all the time and it happened to me as a kid we probably all experienced
01:34:08 this no no you watched sort art online or something like it some shitty show that was your favorite
01:34:15 show and you immediately decided that you wanted to be a writer and your only influence is that one
01:34:21 shitty show you watched so you try to write something exactly like that yeah and if you're
01:34:25 successful at writing something exactly like that shitty successful show you also have now
01:34:31 written a shitty successful show it's just that it strikes me as particularly strange that the
01:34:35 market would come to support like shittier products instead of rewarding the what i would assume is
01:34:42 better quality stuff you know what i have a theory on this because it's easier to make it's easier to
01:34:46 make but i think we're just talking more to the who's buying it right yeah it's the same people
01:34:50 the dude here's the thing we can tie this all back together it's the exact same mentality is why you
01:34:55 bought all those fucking games because the aesthetic of the book itself yeah and the number one thing
01:35:00 you remember it's all marketing it's the it's the producers the most important thing to remember
01:35:04 about light novels is that the writing doesn't matter the cover matter exactly because every
01:35:10 novel is a two-man team it's a guy who wrote the book and then the guy who did the illustrations
01:35:15 and those guys are equally important exactly they are of equal importance if not the character
01:35:21 designers even more you know and these character designers like like whereas the the art the the
01:35:26 writers are all these you know these young dudes who are probably submitting to contests like you
01:35:30 know dengueki bunko probably has a contest like every month hey who's who wants to be a writer
01:35:34 you know you do your story shit let's publish it and then they farm artists off of like pixiv
01:35:40 you know pixiv yeah so they'll just go on there and find someone who's popular and be like let's
01:35:44 hire this fucking guy makes sense super underpaying yeah exactly and slap that guy's fucking art on
01:35:50 this guy's shitty book and now you've got a product and now you've got the asterisk war you know uh
01:35:55 or or like like with the in the case of the asterisk war the guy had previous who did the character
01:36:00 designs had previously done a series called uh what the fuck is it called is some other bullshit
01:36:06 fucking shit and it wasn't shit great yeah it was a bullshit shitty show that was really popular
01:36:12 because of how hot the girls were and it's like there's no reason that asterisk war would have
01:36:17 gotten an anime if not for the fact that the same character designer did that novel and like they
01:36:22 probably just like some novelists came up with the story and they said oh let's put a let's put
01:36:27 this guy on it and they put that guy on it and now that novel regardless of what it is has a future
01:36:32 because that artist drew two you know life is successful because she was on the cover but the
01:36:38 people orchestrating all this are the people at these companies that choose to publish these books
01:36:43 written by these people they're the ones who get in touch with these artists because they don't have
01:36:46 to pay anybody a lot of money it's because they know they'll sell a fuckton yeah and and they see
01:36:50 soulless fucking scum sucking faggots who need to be executed well they're picking out a day
01:36:54 they're picking up the story as well going to japan it's daytime there it's these people we can take
01:36:59 them out it's these people whose responsibility it is to support the company they work for and
01:37:04 guarantee the return on investment through these books and these light novels and these artists
01:37:09 and whatnot it's it's that need to produce and get a return on your investment that's really driving
01:37:15 artistry out the window and bring in bullshit but here's the thing and i mean people can look at this
01:37:20 and be like uh like how is it that all these bullshit things keep getting successful yeah but
01:37:25 that's the thing is that only a small percentage are actually successful but they're paying for all
01:37:31 the failures because like because like i said before whereas only some of these are getting
01:37:36 anime adaptations there are fuckloads of light novels getting published and most of them just
01:37:41 died i know nothing about this market so i don't either i've i've most sure for manga i've tried
01:37:46 googling light novels constantly for manga yeah i've never gotten anything like like how many
01:37:50 times have you started this in any medium how many times have you like a print something not like
01:37:56 anime where it's all made at once like a season is made all in one sitting but like how many times
01:38:01 have you started reading a series and then after like a few chapters it just dies it happens all
01:38:06 the time you know it's tragic and that's like that's what like like light novels they're just
01:38:10 constantly making them and some of them like one comes out nobody buys it it's done but the one
01:38:15 that actually survives that gets the anime it pays for like yeah right exactly so they just
01:38:21 they turn out as many as they can in the hopes that one of them is going to be the golden goose
01:38:25 makes perfect sense the people are dumb enough to buy one of these right and that's why why i hate
01:38:30 a one picture so much the sora online team because it's very clear because they make like
01:38:34 fucking four shows a season because they're just hoping one of them is going to be the cash
01:38:38 they're doing the same thing yeah they're doing the same thing and they just turn out constant
01:38:41 shit and like you know every once in a while one of them sticks and they make a billion dollars you
01:38:46 know but uh somebody has to stop your madness yeah so anybody cares the only way to stop it is
01:38:53 these are just pure market forces driving the entire thing the only way to affect it is that
01:38:57 there has to be the the individual people running these things have to have a guiding light within
01:39:02 them that tells them artistry is what i'm here for and that's what i need to do but here's the
01:39:07 question yeah where's the money come from well how do you define artistry yeah because like
01:39:11 sordot online is unbelievably successful yeah which just means people like it yeah so like
01:39:16 whatever people saw in it is not what you know what we saw in it and the only real way like
01:39:22 the reason that people like us like critics have any importance at all yeah is i mean this is
01:39:27 self-serving but we can affect the way people perceive these things that like i have convinced
01:39:33 hundreds of thousands of people that they don't like sordot online and shouldn't support it
01:39:38 you know and like that's the only way thing you've ever done in your life yeah like how else am i going
01:39:43 to affect the market to make less people want sordot online and more people want log horizon
01:39:47 other than to like convince them that they want one and not the other yeah right and uh and if it
01:39:52 works if enough people like me say it then like it might change something but yep that's what my
01:39:58 hope to do to convince people to do things that are better than what they're doing right now yeah
01:40:03 by your standards by but yeah and i would never say that it's anything other than my personal
01:40:07 our job is the most self-serving in the world in that regard yeah that's entirely true oh god it's
01:40:12 a fucking centaur oh my fuck our centaur is being in tough he'll kill me he'll shoot me full of arrows
01:40:18 and i'll die what the fuck got us on this light novel tangent is there something else eventually
01:40:22 planning to loop back to that i forgot probably but who knows yeah no game no life i haven't bought
01:40:27 specifically because the volumes are 14 dollars a piece i'm just so depressed because i want to
01:40:32 know where it goes it's so it's so interesting because like here like in the top side of the
01:40:36 books are shit though right they they i've only read like one half of the page but it was enough
01:40:40 to tell me that that's even if there's shit like because that's the thing like no game no life might
01:40:45 never get a second season and there were only like i thought it was getting something it's getting an
01:40:49 ova it's been a while that hasn't been here isn't it i thought it was maybe i thought i heard something
01:40:54 about that well the thing is that the the anime like the really popular too wasn't it yeah but the
01:40:58 novels were very new at the time so like there was only four when the anime came out it only adapted
01:41:03 three or it adapted three out of the four so there was there was not enough material for another season
01:41:08 and it was publishing slower than most light novels but uh but yeah that's one of the good ones
01:41:15 when volume four came out in the u.s i was like i kind of really want to know where this goes but
01:41:19 i'm not going to pay 14 dollars for what i know is going to be dog shit writing you know it's not
01:41:23 going to be eloquently written gotta get the uh pdf rip from oh no no no no but so many i'm fucking
01:41:29 bees i love the bees and a demon but that was where you're playing nick cage yeah the swarm of bees
01:41:35 and a demon but that is what i was faced with oh well if you're wondering at all ramp if you're
01:41:41 wondering at all why i'm still behind no the bees are fast and worse please inform and lighten me
01:41:46 because i don't know because the one great thing about light novels is that not unlike this game
01:41:51 crazy fucking ideas get into them like even though the the writing is dog shit like okay a certain
01:41:57 reason i like animorphs there's a lot of cool shit going on yeah a certain magical index is the
01:42:02 perfect example of a series that's like it's full of dumb tropey bullshit just just drink a potion
01:42:07 that permanently made me um weak stupid and clumsy now you know it's like to be me
01:42:15 oh so a certain magical index yeah nothing but like dumb tropey anime bullshit yes it is
01:42:23 it's only sales are driven entirely by waifus right because misaka for some reason is the most
01:42:30 popular waifu of all time and i don't know she's she still wins best girl contests like on both
01:42:36 reddit and on like in japan it's this it's the spats dude it's gotta be this bad it's this girl
01:42:41 named misaka also known as rail gun and her power is that she's like one of the strongest uh espers
01:42:46 in the city and it's there's an academy city it's a city that's all schools that teach people how to
01:42:51 use espers magic and she uses she controls lightning uh and she her thing is that she'll take like a
01:42:57 coin and flick it and it fires like a rail gun and so they call it pretty cool it is cool and she's
01:43:03 just kind of like a sundae girl or whatever who has like she's really strong but for whatever reason
01:43:08 people fucking love her like she's like one of the most popular characters ever and i don't know
01:43:13 why i don't get it either that's special the public continues to baffle me i mean i like her i don't
01:43:19 dislike her i just don't understand the she know i want to just like saber like what yeah i don't
01:43:24 get that even better character design but i don't get the overwhelming love for saber it's just
01:43:30 because i don't know man strong women think about this dude we can't even sit here and complain
01:43:34 about them we just faffed to uh fucking to be downstairs and she has no person i other than
01:43:38 like we can see up her to be is way more interesting inherently than i have any players like you have
01:43:44 some connection i guess but that doesn't do much for me in terms of endearing me to a character
01:43:49 like i don't like my bloodborne guy at all look to to be is in a whole new world there's time to
01:43:53 explore whatever it doesn't we'll find out if she's interesting with the game yeah we'll find out
01:43:57 we'll find out but like i feel like she's going to be a stereotypical i'd have no emotions and by
01:44:01 the end she'll have some sort of like emotional i don't know i don't know i don't know you have to
01:44:05 understand near as off the rails off the rails it could be anything well i would love to be mistaken
01:44:11 because i really like everything else the game so i can't wait to play that fucking game because the
01:44:15 twists are going to be legit but yeah the guy who makes the the near and draken guard games is a
01:44:20 psychopath and his games are full of weird off the wall wait speaking of psychopaths did you
01:44:25 did i haven't talked to you about the fucking godzilla movie coming out this year have i
01:44:29 no but i'm excited you know of course you're fucking oh my god i'm so ah it's like two of the
01:44:35 coolest things yeah uh i've wanted a godzilla animated movie forever before we go down to godzilla
01:44:40 let me finish my point about that i just i'll put my boat away for just that just that index it's
01:44:45 waifu driven it's full of you know anime cliches and dumb bullshit is it worth reading no it is
01:44:51 because it is it is so fucking unhinged with ideas like index has the most detailed
01:44:59 like series of rules and like like things go like every book basically is just to introduce
01:45:05 as many concepts as the author can think it's super interesting when like things like that
01:45:09 happen because like you can it's very interesting when you find pieces of media that are doing so
01:45:13 many extraneous things just to like you know like the author or whatever has like one specific
01:45:19 goal they want to do like this is what they actually care about yeah but you can't just do
01:45:22 that no it's like i can't just make up rules and publish them online and people yeah the man i mean
01:45:26 it's basically a wiki the book is like a wikipedia like like you know if someone just wrote a wiki
01:45:32 for a show and then just like loosely turned that into a book that's kind of what it is i do enjoy
01:45:37 those it's it's just and he never stops coming up with shit and it can lead to amazing shit like
01:45:43 for instance um accelerator is a crazy dude yeah no like the concept of the story is that like
01:45:50 there's there's the academy city which is built built around science and they have to teach people
01:45:54 to like use powers so it's kind of an x-men city like like it's all young people learning how to use
01:45:59 superpowers and they only believe in science but then in like in the beginning of the story the main
01:46:04 character meets this girl named index who is with who works for the church and the church is entirely
01:46:09 governed by magic and it's but it's a secret world it's a whole secret world of magic so basically
01:46:14 the story is about this secret world of magic colliding with the city of science which both
01:46:19 have totally different series of rules like the way that science works is really deep and complicated
01:46:25 and has tons of rules and the same is true of the church and magic but they're totally different
01:46:29 from each other it is cool but meanwhile the main character his only power is that his hand can cancel
01:46:35 anything it can cancel all magic it can cancel all science and it constantly cancels his own luck
01:46:41 it can cancel all science so everything for like anything he touches everything will go wrong for
01:46:46 it of course the first thing this is used for is uh the the girl index i'm wearing a protective
01:46:51 magical garment but it's but it's genius how it's done it is because because index her outfit is the
01:46:58 walking church right and it protects her from all magic and she she like brags about it it's like
01:47:03 super powerful or something yeah it's like the most powerful armor in the magic universe and he
01:47:07 touches it and it explodes off of her immediately lol naked yes but but it is a clever it works no
01:47:13 it works in terms of like it totally works totally objectifying the female lead that's one of the
01:47:17 better ways i've heard she's garbage anyway she gives a part she's a retard yeah a literal retard
01:47:23 and she doesn't matter after the first book uh but i got my tits in the first book you're all
01:47:28 fucking yes she's a she's a lol yeah but uh well this for people like but that's the thing about
01:47:33 index is that like the like the what happens in the story is just dumb tropey anime bullshit but
01:47:39 how and why it's happening is this really bizarre series of crazy i really wish we could get something
01:47:45 like one punch man for these books like someone just like this is good ideas i'm gonna make it not
01:47:49 below dick well the best okay here's i'll give you one example because this is something i was
01:47:55 watching season two of index and like the first arc of season two was kind of boring up until it
01:48:00 got to this point where like there's there's all these combat nuns right like like that show up
01:48:05 and they're having this huge battle oh i did it and there's and they're fucking did it what did you
01:48:08 do i killed the orc wizard nice orc wizard yeah i was playing a fucking game are you playing i was
01:48:14 fighting an orc wit yeah i know usually i deal with things like bees but um i just meant that orcs
01:48:19 wait are we in the second level orcs and wizards are not i'm like ford i'm like ford
01:48:24 floors deep all right well done level two or level one well this is this is the first zone
01:48:29 okay i just saw a lot of trees are you going down floors or up floors down you gotta go down
01:48:32 okay you're going deeper into the abyss i wasn't sure if you're already in the ow are you getting
01:48:38 yes i'm being harmed i just like the screen is flashing i'm like usually that's a sign oh god
01:48:43 was a fucking iguana oh my god why is it you defeated i can't deal with this shit
01:48:52 i really don't understand okay i think i can get away ramp up yeah it looks like at all
01:48:57 oh thank fucking thank thank guanas do thank mock lab
01:49:04 so anyways there's all these combat nuns and they're fighting on the roof of this building
01:49:09 and like there's just one girl this game is a fucking clusterfuck i'm getting like i'm having to
01:49:13 like flee every floor like back and forth because there's all these things that i don't want to deal
01:49:17 with but then they keep pushing me back you can't keep running away from your problems then there's
01:49:21 just no end to the stupid shit look that's life okay well i have to run away from my house in six
01:49:27 months well sure okay okay okay combat nuns yeah all on the roof finish your thought fighting fighting
01:49:32 this building and like there's all these people running around with all these different fucking
01:49:36 powers and there and all the combat nuns have different weapons everyone's got something unique
01:49:40 every fucking character's got some completely different crazy shit with its own rules and
01:49:44 there's one character who's like singing this uh this hymn and like it's like permeating through
01:49:50 this this whole area and like it makes it so people can't use like certain attacks when
01:49:54 there's this hym's going and they really need to use those attacks so all the nuns pull out chopsticks
01:49:59 and just stab themselves in the ears so they can no longer hear the hymn and it won't disrupt their
01:50:05 magic and so they go in and start fighting and i was like like when you see something like that it's
01:50:09 just like everything's justified all the dumb bullshit is justified because that was awesome
01:50:15 it is pretty awesome we need we need some lots of stuff like that they just someone who rents
01:50:20 do you know how they make a bajillion dollars it's super edgy by the way one of these light
01:50:23 well there's a lot of fun well the thing about index is that it has edgy moments but it's really
01:50:28 goofy like i've seen a bunch especially like the anime i mean the anime is goofy itself but the
01:50:33 narration of the book is really like sarcastic and silly and like doesn't take itself seriously at
01:50:39 all like you can tell that it's which is what i like about it it's not that it's well written
01:50:43 but it's very silly it doesn't take itself seriously and it's fun to read and uh and there's lots of
01:50:49 there's just so many like random comments like the main character will be running down a hallway
01:50:52 and he'll like there'll be talismans all over the walls like because of some you know something to do
01:50:57 with some magic and then he'll like make an observation about like hmm and i noticed that
01:51:01 like it says this thing which means this and like um oh yeah that's why those are there and i'm just
01:51:06 like there's this is so much like it's so much shit um and did you remember when we bought those
01:51:11 rambutans yes i just found some rambutans yes this game is why i know about rambutans although they've
01:51:18 they've generousized the fruits into just being fruits but they used to be you could find like
01:51:22 black currents or like lentils or stuff or just just like okay i found an artifact robe
01:51:28 it's gonna be wait i'm gonna identify it just for fun oh before i put it on every time you do
01:51:33 something it is a plus two robe a tuam oh it prevents me from casting but it's really good
01:51:40 oh you have to cast spells this is it oh my no it's so fucking good but it prevents spell casting
01:51:49 that's the worst possible so fucking good that's good if you need to fucking run away from something
01:51:54 because you're not going to be casting you can buff yourself you'll have it the thing is it takes
01:51:58 it's the robe of ben sainth kind of the thing is it takes a pseudo realistic amount of time to put
01:52:04 on things it doesn't just take one blip it takes like several rounds to put that is that is the worst
01:52:10 thing i've ever heard maybe here's that here's that secret here's that secret entrance i was
01:52:14 looking for before but it's long since rusted over oh yeah it did not work out that's okay it's
01:52:19 just the sewers fuck the sewers no i was i was saying like what if they want to like make a bajillion
01:52:25 dollars they need to one of these companies who publishes all these light novels they need to
01:52:29 just get that one successful thing we get like a trillion dollars and use like
01:52:34 half of it just like we're gonna hire a team of one get like all the gay step one get like a trillion
01:52:40 dollars well i'm clearly it's not that hard i'm sure these books have editors they're just very
01:52:45 lax they need they need better editors editing editing is is the thing but yeah like like
01:52:51 but the sad thing about all this is that like like something like index um is probably like at
01:52:58 best a six out of ten and it's still one of the better light novels well here's here's the thing
01:53:03 i can just hear you describe that i'm thinking like what if um jeez what if they just like decided
01:53:09 just cut the bullshit and they just just they wrote the book like you just described it's super
01:53:13 conversational so you're not even reading it with the expectation of reading a book it's just
01:53:17 like i want to hear some guy tell me what's cool of shit that would be great and some of them are
01:53:22 borderline that i mean that would be so i would be so much more down to read something like that
01:53:26 than someone attempted to do pros badly oh yeah i mean like that's every time i get stuck writing
01:53:31 s l i literally just turn into a valley girl and i'm like and then like they did this thing and it
01:53:34 just it comes out so much easier you don't have to like that's dude for years i was considering um
01:53:41 like abandoning writing books and just writing wikipedia's like i was just going to write wikis
01:53:47 for my stories because though they existed but not actually write the stories and so i mean i
01:53:52 don't know how i'd monetize that but i just like it was the only way i could think to just get the
01:53:56 fucking ideas out there without having to write shitty like like because the uh the the index guy
01:54:02 that's what he should have done that's what he wanted to do yeah well he he just works out well
01:54:07 yeah he's extremely famous no i'm talking i'm talking from a and also puts out integrity standpoint
01:54:12 and also has put out four books a year for 15 years by the way impressive work it is pretty
01:54:17 i will i will not and he runs like several extremely successful series want to do there is
01:54:22 impressive no matter how bad it actually is there is a quote inconspicuous book over right here that
01:54:30 sounds incredibly such incredibly conspicuous um so i but i need to be able to fly to get to it so
01:54:35 oh wait wait wait i have one i have a potion of flight well so i'm just gonna touch this clearly
01:54:41 fuck me in the butthole thing it is a sif moon is compendium of the frostbite uh which is honestly
01:54:47 not that useful so whatever it's a shame oh well that's fine yeah uh god the guy who writes index
01:54:55 he also writes heavy object which also got an anime adaptation last year and like several other
01:55:02 like he'll he will have years go by where he has written installments into like five different series
01:55:09 and multiples of some of those how do you even keep your brain organized like that
01:55:13 clearly he just doesn't he just needs to have a mental like orgasm every now and then just get
01:55:19 these ideas out of him i mean he's just he's he's one of those guys who's described as like you
01:55:23 know i don't want to do anything but be writing you know like a steven thing or something yeah
01:55:28 nissi always seen is also i gotta get to that point um and he's fucking unbelievably successful
01:55:33 but nissi always seen is another one where it's like in his case it's that he writes such his
01:55:39 okay i would describe his dialogue as so stilted and awkward that it's its own style and it's awesome
01:55:46 like it's it's it's full circle i'll give you the better have you ever seen any of bakemonogatari
01:55:50 or katana gattari or any anything with the gattari in the title oh yeah um
01:55:59 yeah he's known for those and and for some other stuff but his his like his characters all just
01:56:04 have the most bizarre like thought processes and like reasons for thinking what they think
01:56:11 and they just talk that's all they do his novels are just non-stop dialogue yeah it's really
01:56:15 none of which is natural at all but it's so fucking weird that it's really my books
01:56:20 are nothing but dialogue but it's done well not to to my own horn no no go ahead to your own horn
01:56:26 i mean nissi always seen is famous for amazing dialogue it's just that it's it's like amazing
01:56:31 in that it is so out there that it's really amazingly confusing um it's it's so interesting
01:56:39 because like this whole discussion we've been having like this entire time it's basically
01:56:42 saying like we live in like the post-talent era like you don't need to be terrified to be successful
01:56:48 why do i stress myself out so much about being good and yet and yet like like i i it freezes me
01:56:54 in place not be able to do anything because like it's not good enough but clearly being good
01:56:57 is does not matter anymore no well it's not the primer i don't think it ever mattered it's i don't
01:57:02 think it ever mattered well i think it matters significantly less now just because like the
01:57:07 volume of stuff can be done oh dude i found a store well i don't i don't think being good was ever a
01:57:12 thing i think it's just that there was a taste that that was that was calm you know i kind of i
01:57:18 kind of agree with you just because like shakespeare is so renowned and he's basically just like
01:57:22 trash back in his day well like it's just that like the reason taste gets made is like let's say
01:57:27 there's only let's say we're back in the day and you can only publish one book a year like you just
01:57:34 don't have the technology to publish more than one book a year you publish that book everyone reads
01:57:39 that book it's everyone's first exposure to art so their taste is that book it's true now if you
01:57:45 write another book that's nothing like that book people are going to go well that book was good
01:57:50 this is something different i don't like it as much this is bad and then if you write something
01:57:55 that's exactly like the previous book but you know a little different that people go oh this is like
01:57:59 that this is what good is you know and then everyone just takes influence from the same book
01:58:04 and that's what good is and then eventually there's people out there it's a gross simplification but
01:58:09 then there's i can't argue but there's some people who read that book and they go well i hate this
01:58:13 i'm gonna write my own thing yeah and i'm gonna write my own thing and then they write their own
01:58:19 thing and nobody cares about it because it's not good you know to them but then sometime in the
01:58:26 future we now have the internet and you can publish that you can publish that thing and
01:58:32 everyone goes uh like everyone's like well this isn't good until that one guy finds it who's like
01:58:38 this is exactly what i wanted and it used to be that you could only show whatever book you wrote
01:58:44 to the people in your village or to some publisher who doesn't want it right but now i can go like
01:58:49 like imagine your village is the entire world yeah your village is everywhere and like as long as you
01:58:54 can just get it into the hands of those people who want it then you're good and that's the hardest
01:59:00 part that's the entire struggle of publishing on the internet it's not about being good it's not
01:59:03 about anything it's about finding the people yeah finding your tribe exactly exactly what it is and
01:59:08 it's like where is my tribe are they on reddit are they on fourchan are they over here are they over
01:59:13 there i just gotta spam it are they on tumblr please tell me they're somewhere you know is it the guy
01:59:18 who inspired me is he going to like my stuff as much as i like his stuff let me send it to him
01:59:23 maybe he'll post it on his twitter you know like that's you're desperately trying to find your
01:59:27 tribe it is a struggle for sure this makes me wonder what the end goal of all this is
01:59:32 what's it what's what are we all getting at with this are we talking about humanity oh no
01:59:37 no you got this barely survived all right well barely survived that fucking centaur what are you
01:59:42 talking about the point of like of the creative struggle yeah the point of art in general why
01:59:47 it's consumed i think it's i think the why really why we should give a shit but the point i don't
01:59:51 think anyone needs to give a shit i think the only people that give a shit are the person making it
01:59:56 for themselves i think i like making it and i need to justify why well to me the purpose of art
02:00:02 is to let people contextualize themselves and the world around them people don't like when you when
02:00:07 you are just like let's say you're just working all the time yeah all you do is work and at some
02:00:12 point you take a step back and realize i don't even like doing this why the fuck am i doing this
02:00:18 why is living a thing why am i alive why would i be doing this and then you read a book and you go
02:00:27 oh that's why that's why that's why it's this thing this makes sense now and then you're like
02:00:34 i i want another and then you read another one and you go and this is how people sustain themselves
02:00:41 through working these like to me the most important thing my videos do is make it so someone who can't
02:00:47 do what i do uh and is working some shit job somewhere doesn't kill themselves today you know
02:00:53 like if my video sounds melodramatic but it actually is i've got lots of comments to this
02:00:58 effect in the past that like you know uh like your video came out today i felt like dog shit and
02:01:04 wanted to die and then i watched the video and now i feel okay like that's the most important thing
02:01:09 my videos can do is make people not want to kill themselves because the simple act of living sucks
02:01:14 you know um yikes something feels off about that like why what is their justification for not
02:01:23 killing themselves by being entertained just feeling just feeling like someone like whatever
02:01:29 you've never been working at your job and just being like this fucking blows balls imagine if
02:01:35 you'd went and worked at your job no i know i came home and did nothing but like stared a wall
02:01:40 and jerk off yeah you just didn't have the artistic spark but what but what am i giving that that you
02:01:45 can't like i think what you're asking is more philosophical it like like okay um why don't
02:01:51 you give an answer here's here's a great what do you think it is i think he's trying to figure it out
02:01:55 here's a great example from uh from how i have an answer how i've kind of understand this from a
02:02:00 lot of people like um you know i spend a lot of time on forums in the mid-2000s yeah and i would
02:02:05 continually see people uh like like uh this one forum called otaku boards obviously an anime board
02:02:11 and there there'd be threads about like why you're on this board oh god it's prince fucking ribbit
02:02:16 it's fucking prince ribbit guys it's the ultimate frog man he is the ultimate frog there would be
02:02:21 people who say things like you know in my town which is small town bumfuck know where you say
02:02:27 real bad um like i would get beat up for even saying i like anime like like because it's just
02:02:33 not something that anyone else in the community wants any part of and they think it's devil worship
02:02:37 and faggotry and you get beat up for being well they're not wrong now now let's say let's say you
02:02:42 live in the middle of bumfuck know where and you're gay right no one around you understands
02:02:47 and no one around you to talk to and you don't understand anything and then you watch a show
02:02:52 about being gay or that speaks to you even it's not even about being gay but it's the same kind of
02:02:58 thing right and you watch it and you realize oh like this is a thing this is not i'm not a fucking
02:03:04 demon i'm not a literal devil i'm not going to hell uh god isn't real but art is you know and then
02:03:12 you you you find something to to like to connect with and be like oh i'm a fucking human other
02:03:17 people feel this way you know but then you can't talk to it about talk about it with anybody in
02:03:24 your town because they still don't understand you so then you find the internet and you go wait a
02:03:28 minute there's a bunch of people watching this shit and there's there's gay people everywhere
02:03:33 i'm going to be gay with them and then and then you watch my analysis video so you can be gay with
02:03:38 me you know i see the point you're making and that is interesting and i do see a value in that
02:03:42 but you know what's funny is that the way that i think about my videos is they're kind of constructed
02:03:47 with an inherent assumption that of course anime can have intellectual content that is valuable and
02:03:53 should just be accepted but you know what's really fascinating is that my some of my closest friends
02:03:58 in life uh the guys i went to college with um even just recently i was talking with them about just
02:04:05 you know like gurrenlog and just because they watch have seen my videos and stuff and they just
02:04:10 do not accept that initial premise that there is anything good about anime and that there can be
02:04:16 intellectual content with it they don't even get past that and this shocked me i wasn't even able to
02:04:21 process it well you need to remember that was that was the nature of our entire disagreement about
02:04:25 why i even like the show in the first place they just don't understand that remember how it was
02:04:30 when we were all my little pony guys yes the same thing i mean it's the same thing we still to this
02:04:34 day we have people in the pcp oh my god will not acknowledge that like like like like jeff and monkey
02:04:41 both of them anytime pony comes up like they don't seem to like actually think that the show is
02:04:47 like probably any good you might like they really think we're all just fucking crazy yeah they're
02:04:52 like well that show is obviously gay and we tie him up at night and we force him to watch
02:04:56 i think monkey is in the place that i was before i watched the show and realized that there it really
02:05:02 can't be good oh god it's a bear it's a fucking bear guys for the record i don't think monkey would
02:05:07 like the show oh he gone berserk don't think it would be we need we need to have money watch the
02:05:11 japanese i just don't know then you can appreciate you'd appreciate that more yeah i'm honestly
02:05:16 surprised he has not done i'm honestly surprised he has not done an anime review of my little pony
02:05:21 like before i mean he's planning to do that would be fucking hilarious it seems like an obvious choice
02:05:27 he's he's planning to get bigger plans i think the next fucking uh what's it called anime spectrum
02:05:32 podcast is supposed to be about it really i don't know what to say like you know there's like 17
02:05:37 documentaries so i don't bother going down that route but like yeah like i don't think in in his
02:05:44 or jeff's mind like they even process the idea that it's possible that that show is actually
02:05:50 as good as one of their favorite shows like i don't think they even think that that is a possibility
02:05:55 i wouldn't you know i guess that just shows that people we really do have barriers within ourselves
02:06:00 that a lot of us have to overcome everybody does i mean i we all had to kind of get through that
02:06:05 to different degrees before i saw the my little pony show i thought it was bullshit
02:06:08 and soon it was terrible you know because like i i had to watch all the old ones with my little
02:06:12 sister because she was like five and i was like this is the gayest shit in the world so it was i
02:06:17 just think it was totally there's nothing that baffles me more and this is this is also true
02:06:21 of stuff like kaon and other stuff i like that people anything people treat this way what baffles
02:06:26 me is what you're about to make people will say things like digi bro you you seem like a smart guy
02:06:34 how can you like this thing and my response is shouldn't you shouldn't you reverse engineer that
02:06:39 and think that because i'm a smart guy the things i like probably have something going on you know
02:06:46 what do you think i just like lapse into insanity every day you watch my little pony for no reason
02:06:52 and this is like the thought process that inevitably got me to watch a show and like
02:06:55 anything else that initially was hesitant about was that it's like here's like the
02:07:01 primacy that happens i can either continue to assume that this thing is bullshit or i can
02:07:05 actually give it a shot and i can either a be completely justified in my hatred and nothing's
02:07:09 changed or b i've opened myself up to something new that i like i want more things in my life
02:07:15 to like well you know my friends this was the exact point i raised to my friends and i said well
02:07:20 how do you how do you rationalize the fact that i like the show and get all these things out of
02:07:24 that i have explained in this massive long video that you have seen how do you rationalize that
02:07:29 and their answer was very simple they say nate we think you are just projecting what you want
02:07:33 onto the show and that it doesn't actually exist i don't understand how anyone can think that it
02:07:38 doesn't make sense i don't get it all it is is people who don't make they're giving me so they
02:07:42 don't make art and they don't understand art we went over this in the fucking in the uh the the
02:07:48 intentions of the artist podcast that like everything that's in something had to be put there
02:07:54 you can't just like there's nothing i killed prince ribbit i am the champion of the dungeon
02:07:59 speaking of art art has just been created but wait dead frogs corpse but wait no but but but low
02:08:04 dear viewer look at this it is a human corpse that was left behind by prince he was a human prince
02:08:10 transformed into a blink frog oh my god just kiss him eat him anyway eat him anyway why didn't he just
02:08:16 ask me god you know i guess i guess he can only croak you know he's croaked the dungeon the dungeon
02:08:21 just corrodes our social functions and turns us into monsters well the real monster that's an
02:08:28 interesting point though yeah now i really it's well i okay i kind of want to play devils advocate
02:08:35 in the fact that i think you can project some things well sure it is possible you can project
02:08:41 but like but there's some stuff to there have to be degrees there's definitely there's definitely
02:08:45 agree you know okay for instance in uh in kill luck hill yeah like um some people have said like
02:08:52 what makes you think that like all the like there's all these themes that are that are supposedly
02:08:56 there about like um like japan versus the west and like how things went after world war two
02:09:02 sure and people will say like aren't you just projecting what you want to see onto the show
02:09:06 and it's like why would they choose to like recreate the exact three cities that obu no
02:09:13 odonobu naga went to on his conquest and have the like parts of the show take place there why would
02:09:18 they have like these certain names that refer to all these ancient gods who stand for all these
02:09:24 certain things and like like there's all this symbolism in the show that is that is objectively
02:09:29 there like those things are in the show and like you can very clearly extrapolate that these things
02:09:35 symbolize these other things and like people will say like how can you think that it's like
02:09:39 because none of this is here by accident they didn't they didn't just happen to write you know
02:09:44 the same cities and the same gods into the show and it knows not much more of a stretch not to
02:09:49 diminish the artistic integrity of of doing that but like it's easy to think like oh there's no way
02:09:55 they could have planned all this from like a viewer's perspective but when you're writing something
02:09:59 and you just have to you're inspired by things then it just it just gets in there people who create
02:10:04 or people who don't like think about art have a hard time realizing yeah because that everything
02:10:09 is intentional yeah you know it's just like every word is intention i could explain every single frame
02:10:14 of every video i've ever made and exactly why i chose to put it the way it was you know and in
02:10:19 another thing oh boy and this might this this might i don't know if you guys will agree with this yeah
02:10:24 but i think that the creative part is and like the ideas is by far the easy part like i could i
02:10:32 can make a show and stuff it with every fucking metaphor in the world the hard part is making that
02:10:38 work agree you know like writing that oh organizing the ideas yeah like like like i mean we could
02:10:44 right now i could just ideas i mean i think this is a great example ideas being easy and structure
02:10:49 being like look i could just pick up this can and be like all right this strawberry to can uh in in
02:10:55 this i'm gonna make a short film where i drink the strawberry to can and i place it on the back of
02:10:59 this couch and the couch symbolizes all of society and the strawberry to can symbolizes the atomic
02:11:05 bomb and i'm donald trump and this is what i'm gonna do to the world you know and i'll wear like
02:11:10 i'll wear like a trump mask and all this will be very obvious when when it comes out you know
02:11:14 so i'll just take a drink of the can and i'll say like fuck the world and i'll put it on the couch
02:11:18 and it blows up the world and you all understand right and like like i just came up that's all
02:11:23 stream of consciousness that's how a lot of creativity is like the actual ideas is just oh and
02:11:28 then this happens and this happens and this happens and yeah and then like actually making
02:11:32 that into a coherent a coherent narrative that anyone would get that's the hard part yo check
02:11:37 yo check this out check this out i got this sick ass spell called lee's rapid deconstruction and
02:11:42 it refers to the fact that it rapidly pulls apart ie explodes rocks and so it lets you deconstruct
02:11:49 walls so i'm gonna i'm gonna tear a hole in this wall to get at to get at that altar of vehuma
02:11:54 and pray to my the god that i want however another thing you can do with it is you can use petrify
02:11:59 which i also have i haven't done this yet but i may do it you use petrify and then explode them
02:12:06 but so because it's re it deconstructs rocks right petrify an enemy and then explode the stone
02:12:11 statue also it like does shrapnel damage to everything around it hey that's pretty cool i'm
02:12:15 gonna try and use this more because i'm finally getting to a level of spell casting you're turning
02:12:18 into a cool guy i'm finally getting to a level of spell casting that the spell isn't gonna be
02:12:22 misfiring and contaminating me with mutagenic energies every time i tried to do it only several
02:12:27 times but oh yeah only only maybe 10 percent of the time which is acceptable we're gonna be 10
02:12:33 percent muted instead of 40 yeah i've got a line for you that you should that you should have used
02:12:37 on your friends and could use in the future let's hear it it's it's just simply why do you think that
02:12:43 i'm smarter than the people who made this show that's exactly what i was thinking when we were talking
02:12:48 about this why would you think why would you think that i can get all this out of the show
02:12:52 but they can't i was going to say that's giving me a ton of credit yeah like that i just like i
02:12:56 just really am the best guy yeah i just creatively made up all this crazy stuff that the show can
02:13:02 symbolize just because i'm writing for tv yeah clearly yeah like if i'm if i'm projecting all
02:13:08 this i'm clearly a fucking genius and i have great ideas and i should have written this story myself
02:13:14 well okay i'm gonna i'm gonna say something else and and i agree with your statement completely
02:13:18 and i'm not gonna try i'm gonna try and like add an addendum onto it even if you come up with an
02:13:23 interpretation that wasn't uh supposed to be there i don't think that invalidates it no no at all
02:13:30 like there was an interesting uh there was an interesting uh interview with um uh jeff smith who
02:13:35 made the comic bone yeah sure yeah and he was talking about like because they one of they asked him
02:13:40 like like anything like that's like crazy thing that happened with bone like one of the weirdest
02:13:43 experiences you had with like interacting with people who read bone and he was describing experience
02:13:47 where uh there's the the whole like end like end of the story they're going to the series this um
02:13:53 this city called athea and they're they're trying to get there and they need to get some shit it's
02:13:58 been a while since i don't remember those specific i just remember they need to go to athea and um
02:14:03 they're traveling to get there and this guy comes up to him at a convention and they're talking he's
02:14:06 like gets the book signed he's like i really was fascinated by athea and like the way that you kind
02:14:11 of um because like athea meant atheism right so the whole thing is a metaphor for like the the
02:14:18 crumbling of like religion and going for like humanistic interpretations of things and and he's
02:14:24 just like what the fuck what the fuck just happened what the fuck just happened what do you mean
02:14:29 just like 50 turns past and i died uh did i sit on yes you fucking sat on the keyboard and killed me
02:14:40 i'm sorry wait how did that work though there's a button there's a button what button
02:14:46 s or space or whatever the space bar then that sucks too the f for the fuck you button it was an
02:14:52 accident oh my god i was gonna make it that time i was gonna make it to the ecumenical temple
02:14:59 all right pee break i'm sorry i'm gonna piss away my tears oh my that's that's terrible um i'm
02:15:07 i'm embarrassed that i'm not making it further on these runs but yeah the reason that was at your
02:15:11 fault the reason he called the city of thea is because it was just a play on the gold on
02:15:16 the reason he called the city athea it was just like he just like took athena it took out a letter
02:15:22 athena it sounded cool yeah but like this guy took it and totally ran with that but like
02:15:27 that doesn't technically make it like invalid like it's because like here's the thing how you've
02:15:33 never talked to the guy who made it yep so how do you know what he was thinking yeah you can only
02:15:38 infer you can only infer so varying degrees of even if it's like super obvious like maybe it wasn't
02:15:43 like maybe this guy like clearly like that was i mean as long as he doesn't like like okay there's
02:15:49 a difference between saying i got this out of it and saying like this is what it means yeah yeah right
02:15:53 the story is not about that but you can have that interesting take on it sure like like how i
02:16:00 have like made sordot online better for myself by believing that kirito is a new type and like
02:16:06 like to me that's canon and i know it's oh well i don't know that it's not intentional but to me
02:16:11 it's canon and it makes the story better and as far as i'm concerned it's true does anyone want a beer
02:16:18 we have some right here yeah this um yeah with this pass oh you brought it up okay
02:16:22 yeah i was gonna i will take one i'll take my actually i won't i don't know why i want
02:16:28 i have my cup of water not sitting right there i'm too late for beer
02:16:36 yeah a little bit it's too late i can't i can't fucking believe this dude i was on level seven
02:16:43 i was doing so good ah yeah drow new sorrows it's all my fault you can punish me with your
02:16:51 pee pee
02:16:57 dear viewers apparently did you saying i'm gay over and over is this is a new verbal tick
02:17:02 that's the meme well it's it's the best it's the best meme me and ben have both been doing
02:17:08 i've just been doing it more excessively we've been we've been subject to it since we got here
02:17:13 and uh when you guys like okay like me and ben just walk around the house like looking at each other
02:17:18 and going i'm gay dude me too man yeah i'm so gay yeah have you seen how gay i am
02:17:25 and the answer is always yes not to be funny it's just fine we admit it it's just i guess we've
02:17:30 been admitting it where have you been we feel a certain camaraderie i'm sitting in general
02:17:34 by by sharing our gayness that's good that's good it's healthy yeah you know it's grow and live
02:17:40 together this is the coming out cast yeah so i think the reason we live together but not in a
02:17:45 gay way they're not yet i'm sure you guys feel the same but the reason i'm so adamant about this
02:17:50 whole thing of like everything in there matters is because i know that there are a million things
02:17:55 that everything i make means that no one picks up on and that are like like yeah way more thought
02:18:01 was put into this than anyone realizes you know i'm making making something you know making a story
02:18:07 is it's a lot of fucking work and a lot of things have to go into that i don't feel like a lot of
02:18:11 people miss the things i put in then i tend to make things pretty obvious i guess i don't know i mean
02:18:16 my videos have too fucking many things i disagree in my videos not much is missed other than like
02:18:22 references that nobody would get or like just weird personal in jokes that i like like for instance
02:18:29 the phrase it's all a rich tapestry i work i'll work in the phrase rich tapestry all the time
02:18:35 because it's something that an anime blogger i was a big fan of was like his catchphrase
02:18:39 this guy called anime critique and he would always say it's all a rich tapestry and like
02:18:43 so any excuse i can get to work that into a script i will and like it just sounds like a it's it's a
02:18:49 pretty normal phrase it's pretty innocuous on its own it's only when you realize that i've used it in
02:18:54 so many fucking videos that you'd go that's weird people don't say that all the time yeah yeah but
02:18:59 like but for me it's this in joke that i'm making like this reference to this this anime guy who's
02:19:06 not even around anymore for the past five he might actually be dead he was he was in like thailand and
02:19:12 there was like he disappeared during a time of political upheaval in thailand oh dear nobody's
02:19:17 heard from him since he was killed on the australian brush fire i really hope not he was one of the
02:19:21 coolest fucking guys on the internet man it will be a real shame if he's gone but hopefully he's
02:19:27 just been in the gulags for a while yeah uh but anyways you know there's there's lots of stuff like
02:19:33 that and then the rap lyrics like the reason i did the whole three hour analyzing my own
02:19:37 raps video it's just because like almost every line it means more than first appears but sometimes
02:19:43 it's just a fucking like the the first word that came to mind that rhymed with the last word is why
02:19:49 that line is there it's interesting how like your creativity has like it has peaks and valleys in
02:19:54 terms of like how invested you were in things well it's just that like i i really enjoy serendipitous
02:20:00 connections i say this all the time like i really enjoy when something just happens to work out and
02:20:05 it is perfect more so than when i really set out to make it perfect like i find a lot of joy and if
02:20:12 i can if i can write lines that just spiral into one another and it brings me to somewhere cool i want
02:20:19 to carve out my fucking victories from the block of marvel in which they're in case i have found
02:20:25 i am trying to become more i go first but it was gonna say in in art i feel like learning to just
02:20:33 not learning to just kind of draw whatever and just sort of deal with it like like i used to save
02:20:38 all my late i used to save everything on different layers and now i'm a lot more as i
02:20:42 combine layers just put it all in one layer if it doesn't work out they're just like i'll you know
02:20:46 i'll correct it yeah i think it's a more healthy way to do it because it is less sacred and you
02:20:51 get more loose and the other thing is like like okay the one of the reason that champion has taken
02:20:57 so long is i had a real shitty um work method before where i i sketched all the it's normal to
02:21:03 sketch all the pages and then you go back and ink them but i've been doing nothing but inking pages
02:21:07 that have been sketched for like months now and i've like i'm right i'm right on the cusp of
02:21:12 finishing that and after it's done i'm never gonna do it again i'm never gonna pre-sketch i'm always
02:21:17 just gonna just draw it as i go because that's how i do with brunswick and it was great yeah and i'm
02:21:20 gonna just just not fucking just just not fucking i'm just well it's not that i'm not gonna sketch
02:21:26 it's that i'm gonna sketch and finish all the same in one go um and and just do a video on how you do
02:21:32 that so i can just you have to figure it out maybe i will actually maybe i will actually that will make
02:21:36 for better fucking uh speed draws because you'll be able to see the entire process yeah okay just
02:21:42 give me the the not speed draw version because i have just watching for like six hours i would do
02:21:48 it too that's how i absorb information slowly hence my whole problem that's why i'm still done
02:21:55 all right um anyway so yeah a fucking fucking whatever let the chips fall where they may that's
02:22:01 all that's what i'm saying the way i write raps is the ultimate in the serendipitous stuff because
02:22:07 i go into every rap with literally no plan i write the first line and like let's say for instance
02:22:13 well here's the one i had like the most plan for was uh i'm mortal and like i was listening
02:22:18 to the beat and it kind of reminded me of chrono trigger and then i thought about how
02:22:24 like in a game like chrono trigger you beat the final boss but ultimately a thousand years later
02:22:29 they're just gonna come back and and all the people you're saving are just gonna die anyways
02:22:33 everyone dies like saving the world is really just prolonging the inevitable for everybody in it
02:22:39 the only way to actually save the world is by creating the singularity and we live forever
02:22:45 you know so yeah everyone else is just a temporary bad guy look at this fucking shit this is an
02:22:49 altar of vehumet right here surrounded by a matrix of fucking spontaneous fireballs well that's
02:22:54 annoying it's it's a bit i'm vex i'm feeling a bit vexed right now but i want it really bad
02:23:00 i'm gonna brave this fucking fire you made it i could die any second oh god oh god i'm all right
02:23:07 let's just i want this okay vehumet welcomes you now let's see if his holy fire eviscerates me
02:23:11 before i go yeah you made it thanks no it looks like i was i'm i'm i'm chosen i was i was chosen
02:23:18 by he something i wanted to i wanted to mention about like like creative process and stuff because
02:23:23 i'm becoming more comfortable with the fact that like pain is right and not wrong yeah because like
02:23:28 i like punished myself for not having it come easily where like yeah if you like want to fucking
02:23:32 kill yourself that means you're on the right track and not on the wrong track well let me sort of
02:23:36 it's sort of well depending i mean the whole thing is that like it's not it's not gonna look
02:23:41 just like usually like you said it's carving it out of the marble you don't you don't just look at it
02:23:44 and it appears you know one of my favorite lines guys is uh i forget which bodybuilder said it but
02:23:50 nothing but a peanut yeah ain't nothing but a peanut ronnie colman ronnie colman the classic
02:23:57 it was uh this is it's about weightlifting but it applies to art in general i think it's um
02:24:03 man is both artist and canvas and he has to chip himself out of the marble in which
02:24:08 is created to sculpt you know whatever you get the idea it's a good line it's a good line yeah so
02:24:13 so anyways that i'm mortal song so that that whole concept i had i came up with the first
02:24:18 three lines based on that concept i would love to save the world but i know every everything dies
02:24:23 we know the cycle never ends but we continue to try if i miss the singularity within my life i'm
02:24:29 fucked and so i wrote the rhyme scheme so then it was just what rhymes with fucked oh no oh jeez oh jeez
02:24:35 so perfect so getting cut by the universe my favorite line in the whole song just because
02:24:42 fucked rhymes with cuck so if i miss the singularity in my full life i'm fucked getting
02:24:45 cucked by the universe now what rhymes with universe verse uh uh it's a little a little
02:24:52 cheap but okay sure yeah well i also do lots of internal rhymes in my songs so i usually am not
02:24:57 as worried about the end and end rhyme but um what if i pull a sing about me and get shot by the
02:25:02 end of the verse which sing about me is a song by kendrick lemar where a character gets shot in the
02:25:07 middle of a verse it's super dramatic and it makes me cry every fucking time i hear it because he's
02:25:12 he's saying like uh he's like um and if and if this meets you for your album or if i die before
02:25:19 your album drops i hope you and then you hear cucko co and it just stops fucking i never understood
02:25:24 what the hell is going on there but now he's he's like kendrick's reading a letter like the whole
02:25:29 concept of that song is he's reading letters from people from the ghetto who are who are still there
02:25:33 like talking about his music and what it means to them so the one guy's like really you know like
02:25:37 yeah man you really got out there and you're saying something that means something you know i hope that
02:25:41 one day i can make it out but as he's saying that he gets shot and dies it's brutal it's really
02:25:46 fucking horrific um anyways so i'll pull a sing about me and get shot by the end of the verse
02:25:53 the real curse is not knowing yet feeling the need for their goal towards which to continue growing
02:25:59 and never slowing even when it hurts and it's just me thinking like what word rhymes with slowing
02:26:03 and how does that relate to this theme and then i just keep building more rhymes on yeah there's no
02:26:09 fucking plan and any of them all of them are written very fast and uh and i feel bad about it
02:26:15 because my rhymes are the weakest part of my songs is that they're they're not creative they're all
02:26:20 just like the first word that came to mind that i could work into fitting the theme somehow but as
02:26:25 a result that's how i do it too i have like four or five songs where i have the lines um uh uh uh
02:26:34 stacks tax uh like i keep rhyming tax and stacks and health and wealth like i'm always talking about
02:26:41 how i'm trying like like all i really care about is my health and wealth and so i keep bringing it up
02:26:46 over and over again throughout the album because it's such an easy rhyme yes it is that uh that it
02:26:51 just always comes up but yeah i like that that kind of uh just just run at it as hard as you can
02:26:59 and let make things come out of it out of the uh out of the out of the bullshit i've been in awe
02:27:05 recently being around jesse again it his is almost uh unbelievable ability to spontaneously rhyme on
02:27:13 command yeah it's it's uh it's above what your average human being is capable of it really seems
02:27:19 to me everything that's good about jesse's art comes from a place of just being a literal artistic
02:27:26 genius and like that one certainly seems that way at the very least i i feel like most of what's good
02:27:32 about him has less to do with forethought and more to do with just raw ability to come up with shit
02:27:38 yeah off the top of his head out of nowhere he has good he has good creative it's it's so interesting
02:27:42 for me to be around that it's like a you know it's like a stat balance thing right yeah like he has
02:27:48 all of his points taken out of competence at basic human function and all put into creative ability
02:27:53 yeah um that's the only that's true i mean when you i want you when you look at jesse if you ever
02:28:00 feel jealous about his creative ability just consider what cost it has come at and ask yourself
02:28:04 if you want to live that life yeah that's true that's true do you want to live that life remember
02:28:11 just remember what it took to get him here remember you know another remember how he
02:28:16 actually feels about his own life which is pure misery and ask yourself if you want if you want
02:28:21 the talent at that cost and it's also important to reflect on how capable is this person of enjoying
02:28:28 the spoils right which is really not at all what you're saying and then no matter how much
02:28:33 he makes on patreon it doesn't matter because he hates his job you know because he'll just never
02:28:38 forget that girl in high school he knew who i don't even know but something happened and it'll
02:28:43 never forget it well apparently he's now uh like he's now officially i won't talk about this on the
02:28:49 show but i'm curious well talk to him later no i hate it well he's he may or may not be actually
02:28:56 like hooking up with boozy flusie she might be his real girlfriend she is his real girlfriend is
02:29:00 that a fact well you know i i didn't want to get into that i was just saying they're gonna get a
02:29:05 place together and everything whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa well he's busy moving out of the basement
02:29:10 i think so i think we're gonna get a place together up there in michigan i'm actually like
02:29:13 really happy to hear that yeah it sounds cool pot potentially positive positive thing uh but
02:29:19 anyways yeah he can't be happy because he hates youtube and he doesn't respect the medium at all
02:29:24 yeah uh but it's also where he makes his money yeah the problem is i hate everything i do yeah so
02:29:33 that's that's not fun that's a challenge it is mentally let's let's go get him he's downstairs
02:29:38 he's sleeping he's vulnerable let's fucking get him guys like like like kill him yeah yeah like kill
02:29:43 him you know what's our motivation again i don't i don't know okay whatever he's finally started to
02:29:48 be happy we can't why are you asking me about motivation it's time for action question good
02:29:54 boy good boy this is this could be our only chance to do something we gotta find out if you're
02:29:59 killing artists you gain his powers oh god it's segment i don't i don't know if i want if i only
02:30:05 get the powers it's only the powers yeah the rule states the powers not the deficiencies yeah that
02:30:10 just wouldn't be fair that would be nice because you you because that wouldn't be fair because you
02:30:14 only know his powers and you don't really know persons deficiencies i know jesse's deficiencies
02:30:19 well you do i experience jesse's deficiencies all the time such as when i'm trying to get him to
02:30:23 radcon and he hasn't bought a fucking plane ticket until two days into radcon yep yeah it was a very
02:30:29 port city and is what i would consider a deficiency i i wouldn't argue that fact
02:30:36 i'm gonna fucking have an ulcer oh i have one i don't recommend it oh no i think things will
02:30:42 actually have an ulcer i actually do have an ulcer holy shit from stress yes i've been in the
02:30:47 hospital seven times in the last six months because of stress jeez that sucks yeah good times oh no
02:30:54 have you considered taking a chill pill um well good idea good idea i've there they
02:31:02 i've talked to three therapists they've all said you probably should be partially committed that's
02:31:05 how fucked up you are i'm just like no oh dear fuck that that is scary so scroll teleportation
02:31:11 oh please activate is there a way to be partially committed there we go it's you do like a nine to
02:31:16 three thing on weekdays and you just go there they try like a full-time job how do you make money if
02:31:21 you uh how do you survive you don't do you get welfare if you're partially committed no you do
02:31:26 well then what the fuck why would they yeah what a shitty recommendation it's a week long program
02:31:30 i guess only do it for one well i guess that's not the end of the world i work on weekend so it
02:31:36 wouldn't fuck with me well why not go for it is it expensive i have no idea i never as soon as as
02:31:42 i said i'm like well i'm not talking to you anymore i'm fucked we're not that fucked i refuse to
02:31:47 admit to myself that i'm that bad well that sounds like a healthy way to go if i had if i if i have
02:31:52 any problem at all i'm gonna go seek help that's my current policy even like if i stub my toe and
02:31:57 it hurts for more than an hour i'm going to the hospital that's that's i mean my problem is like
02:32:01 i'm like a hypochondriac so like already like freaked out about medical things too much already
02:32:06 yeah but they told you to go do it well it's not like you're just making this up in your own mind
02:32:11 that's true i guess i guess part of my anxiety and depression is feeling anxious about my anxiety
02:32:15 so it's just it's a fun little like stacking effect yeah synergy anxiety is uh is synergy yeah
02:32:23 it's pretty bad it wouldn't recommend it you know how a black hole like splits you in half over and
02:32:28 over and over again forever is that true uh well it's a theory if you get sucked into a black hole
02:32:34 it keeps dividing you in half over and over forever wait along what line i don't know about that man
02:32:40 what does that mean okay whatever all right sounds cool i like it i heard it in a thing one it compresses
02:32:46 you into an infill i think it might happen in a junji ito but oh yeah all right that's about right
02:32:53 no i think throw that out the window i have heard it in something but it was sci-fi so i don't know
02:32:58 yeah all right how true it is i don't think i don't think that's true um well i don't think we
02:33:03 we're going to assume it's true and that it's a metaphor for anxiety all right that's good so like
02:33:09 like an intentional one i'll accept it i'm in a black hole of emotions right now that sounds
02:33:15 fucking emo every every every everything you're anxious about like doubles it does it creates a
02:33:20 second anxiety it's really fucking annoying and you can't really do anything about it well you
02:33:26 can't really do anything about it right i can do something about it well i'm glad you're better
02:33:31 me in that way too i guess uh you just have to now i feel anxious about being inferior to you
02:33:36 oh no way well i i just like when i hate when people say you when they mean themselves
02:33:43 because it's like like it this is everyone does it all the time but you know people people people
02:33:52 people say like like when someone's telling a story about something that happened to them
02:33:56 and they keep saying you like like they're describing that they walked into a club and
02:34:00 saw like these like like a beautiful light and that's like and you walk in and there's this beautiful
02:34:05 light and you're just like oh my god and i'm like no none of that happened to me this is your story
02:34:10 this happened to you you know do people tell first person accounts in yeah all the time i've never
02:34:16 personally done that if you if you listen to enough people talk you're gonna start now now that i've
02:34:21 i gotta i gotta say did you this is not something i've experienced you've just you've just ruined
02:34:25 conversation now that i've put it in your mind you'll notice it forever i did i did i told my mom
02:34:29 this problem and like it suddenly bothered her more than anything in the world for years that
02:34:34 she i feel like as long as you like frame this with like picture this that would solve the whole
02:34:39 problem i mean oh god it's my ghost it's my fucking ghost he's back he's back with my dad like that
02:34:45 that exact example i used of walking into the club is one that i remember my dad that is so weird
02:34:50 i've never heard anyone tell you know what maybe you probably have dude it's probably the first
02:34:54 time it happens i'm gonna call you up and just say faggot and then hang up your phone and you'll
02:34:59 know why this is so terrible i'm fucked i'm gay i'm just gonna drink all my potions pray for the
02:35:12 best and and hope something good happens read all my scrolls scroll of identify really helpful
02:35:17 the worst part about what i just described is that i also say you when i mean me sometimes uh and yet
02:35:24 i complain to other people when they do it well we're all hypocrites but because i especially the
02:35:29 fact that i put it in my mom's head anytime i do it around her she immediately correct me
02:35:33 i'm just like uh but but she my mom's passive aggressive and never just says what she means
02:35:38 like so i'll be telling that and she'll just start going you yeah and i'll be like what what do you
02:35:43 what do you fucking mean you she's like you like well at some point i have to like realize oh i must
02:35:49 have said you and that meant me yeah i gotta have a twist the knife a little bit on that
02:35:56 she's she's i'm gonna be okay i'm gonna get away my mom has an interesting way of communicating
02:36:03 which is i'm gonna shoot him before i go it didn't work say things that make sense to her without
02:36:07 consideration for whether they make sense to you in the moment
02:36:13 oh god i'm so gay so gay what time is it it is like four or five in the morning oh my god
02:36:22 this is like the best podcast we've ever done it's a really good podcast i was i'm surprised
02:36:28 wide ranging it's it's it covered a lot of bases everyone except ben said a lot but ben
02:36:35 i've been having a great time over here ben ben said the most emotionally charged things
02:36:39 is a good way every time ben freaks out and dies we need to put a mid roll add in
02:36:45 that's actually a great idea why not i ask you this is the segment this is the ultimate
02:36:52 decompression chamber i'm just gonna call this like the procrastinators decompression chamber
02:36:57 it's everything works for me this is why we all need to be in the vicinity so we can do
02:37:02 shit like this all the time yeah this is exactly what i want everyone patreon.com slash all of us
02:37:08 fix this problem this could be a bi-weekly series if you people got off your ass no it's more ghosts
02:37:15 it's more ghosts ben because that you buy this ghost constantly that's those are the only ghosts
02:37:19 the only ghosts are you that's enough that's deep man granted like 50 percent of everything i said
02:37:25 is stuff i've also said elsewhere that people probably be like yeah we know yeah we hear you
02:37:30 say this every other week don't assume that everybody
02:37:34 that's why that's why it's good that like yeah like you know i i personally hear myself talk so
02:37:42 much that i get really paranoid about telling the same stories all the time and it drives me crazy
02:37:47 because through the process of having made 1600 videos yeah everything i have to say has been
02:37:54 something interesting like i've been i've been just looking at stuff in journal like blogging
02:37:58 and vlogging and stuff and people recycle content constantly yeah it's a good strategy well the thing
02:38:03 is i think the problem with me is that most people recycle because they don't remember like like i've
02:38:10 seen yeah really like i don't know okay there's definitely an intentional recycling of content
02:38:15 for some some people are like uh like almost like bernie sanders i have this i have a problem with
02:38:20 bernie sanders which is that one time i decided to actually watch him talk and then i did another
02:38:26 time and he said all the he said the exact same thing he has like two thousand points the entire
02:38:30 which is both the strength and a massive weakness yeah and well it just makes it it makes it so as
02:38:34 soon as i've seen one of the sauce like oh i'll never watch him again yeah the only thing the only
02:38:37 reason it worked is because the two things he was saying nobody was talking about yeah well there's
02:38:41 some there are some like internet personalities who are like really hammering this one point
02:38:47 that they want like everyone to accept and all their stuff is about that like the guy who does the
02:38:53 the ten universes theory he's got like fucking a hundred fucking videos on his channel all just
02:38:59 explaining the same theory like more and more in depth uh i mean i think he's probably on some
02:39:04 level insane yeah probably but like there's a lot of people like that but then there's
02:39:08 ones like dan avidan from uh game grumps where he'll tell the same stories like over and over
02:39:14 because he just has a shit memory and doesn't realize he's told them before and erin who's too
02:39:19 busy playing video games doesn't stop him yeah you know uh or kasey nice that in the process of
02:39:24 watching all his vlogs i've heard him explain certain things like dozens of times just because
02:39:29 he obviously doesn't remember everything he said in a vlog yep uh but i remember everything i've
02:39:34 said so like i start telling a story and i immediately know i know i've said this before
02:39:39 and i'll i'll say it often in the chagas i know i've explained this before but but there's only
02:39:44 like two people who've actually heard me explain everything yeah i'm sure that's true like i think
02:39:49 if i could help explain whatever you're doing at that time or even if it's just if it's pertinent
02:39:54 to the topic at hand it's worth repeating if it's especially when you have a cajillion subscribers
02:40:00 like you do well most i mean like if this was a main channel content i wouldn't count on those
02:40:06 people having heard anything i've said yeah because the only people who i really think of as my audience
02:40:10 are the people who watch all the other shit the procrastinators is a fucking cult and we know
02:40:15 that you all suck our dick i like i almost i'm at a point right now just suck our patreon
02:40:20 dicks a little bit harder and you'll be even cooler i'm honestly at a point where i really
02:40:24 don't think of digi bro as like my channel it's just like a repository for my high effort content
02:40:31 yeah like like the stuff on the digi bro channel sounds like you're a brand now dude well like
02:40:36 pretty scary the procrastinators channel and digi bro after dark ink oh no like like digi
02:40:42 bro to dark and procrastinators these are channels that i manage like out of like a personal need
02:40:48 to make this kind of content and to and to have a conversation with this audience like like the
02:40:54 people who are watching this stuff i'm expecting them to be watching like a lot of shit that i make
02:40:59 and to be like following this ongoing narrative of who i am and the people watching digi bro like
02:41:05 those are just videos that are constructed to be like a piece of information that i want to share
02:41:10 and those people like anyone who's not also following all the other shit i don't expect them
02:41:14 to know anything about me you know so like the presentation of videos on the digi bro channel
02:41:20 is in a vacuum each video is presented as though the others don't really exist whereas the videos on
02:41:26 the videos on after dark and procrastinators are presented assuming that you know literally
02:41:31 everything about me if you're watching on digi bro you're a fucking normie if you're if you're at
02:41:36 the procrastinators level you're now a cult member yeah i mean to start selling robes because the
02:41:41 problem by him this channel like i think one of the weaknesses of this channel in terms of growth
02:41:45 is that it's very assumptive because it totally we all assume you know all nine of us you know
02:41:52 there's nine members and we just work from the assumption that you're familiar with all of our
02:41:56 because we it's not even like if you're in a niche you know all of us we're all scared you know
02:41:59 it's not like the horse days when we all kind of did the same yeah we're all over the math now
02:42:04 like i mean here's a sentence that comes up in nearly every procrastinators is in my video that
02:42:10 came out today it's very and and like we say it all like like like if we're talking about the lucifer
02:42:15 in the biscuit hammered video you'll say something like you know well this video i just put out the
02:42:20 lucifer one you know and like if you know anyone who doesn't follow your channel or hasn't seen that
02:42:26 video has no fucking idea what you're talking about and if they're listening to it like 20 weeks later
02:42:31 in another videos out then it's no longer your latest video and so like yeah every like we do this
02:42:37 constantly on the show yeah we always talk about using like cards or something to start like back
02:42:44 linking to yeah i mean that takes effort it does like we'll do stuff like like make a like a joke
02:42:52 reference to something that happened in an episode of a monkey jones let's play yeah and we will all
02:43:00 laugh like because we all think it's funny as shit and it's like how many audience members
02:43:05 have watched a monkey jones let's play at the same time though would we really want to make
02:43:11 professionalism or anything else we would not want to dumb it down no yeah we have to like the goal
02:43:15 is to suck more people in to make them watch all this shit we want we want you to be cult members
02:43:20 that's really the if you feel like you don't know what you're doing that's your fault i mean we have
02:43:25 to just be here yet format changes have come up about ways to make the content more appealing to
02:43:30 wider audiences i don't know how to solve this particular problem here well like we hope that
02:43:35 people will eventually love us more if they just watched all of us it wouldn't be a problem so
02:43:39 just do that i mean but like when we make because some of this stuff like horseshoe heaven yeah that's
02:43:45 got like a hundred subscribers like a couple hundred and it's my fucking it's my favorite of
02:43:50 jessie jessie's channel of course it is the one that i would unsubscribe last if i had to cut all
02:43:55 my channels if i am speaking correctly the only way to find out about horseshoe heaven yeah was like
02:44:02 like hey it was a secret link it was a hidden link in a video yeah and the channel it actually
02:44:07 has like 300 subs i think well i think it has like 700 or something yeah it had made a hole to do
02:44:12 about passing it has like 500 i think yeah yeah but like it was literally a hidden link on one
02:44:19 endless jess video yeah so if you haven't watched that one video and found the hidden link and
02:44:24 actually sat through yeah all of horseshoe heaven then you probably don't know what alien boy is
02:44:30 that's true and so when we all start laughing about alien boy or making a reference to like
02:44:36 kid i be in this video like these are all jokes that no one gets no one knows what we're talking about
02:44:43 we must sound like mad men but we're not you're the mad man for not being cool enough yet yeah
02:44:49 but like like even if we just said like go watch all of our videos on all of our channels like that
02:44:55 still is not gonna lead you to horseshoe heaven no it won't think about this though how fucking
02:44:59 mind-blowing would it be is say like two years from now we go to like some random convention or
02:45:05 something yeah and people come who are like fucking on our level and just like die we can talk to them
02:45:10 like we know them i mean there's people that would be like eerie that would be interesting that would
02:45:15 be that'd be really fucking i don't know if i'd like it that's really famous i think i would think
02:45:20 it was cool if people i think there's people i can like lachlan still uh who's a frequent commenter
02:45:26 like he knows like i have never really spoken to him but he knows literally everything you know
02:45:33 this means some people's tizm is us yeah it's interesting like lachlan lachlan i mean he makes
02:45:39 his own videos now too but he knows yeah he's he's watched everything i've ever made and everything
02:45:45 anyone in the pcp has ever made and most of what we've ever made reference to and like like you know
02:45:51 if you want to cheat i mean it's not just us he follows a lot of people but like he knows
02:45:55 everything there is to know about us and he can come into like a thread like like on my Reddit
02:46:00 and just like say some shit and i like to me it's like yeah like i don't even i don't even stop and
02:46:06 think i've never talked to this guy because just knowing that he's seen all my videos i already
02:46:10 have an understanding that like this dude knows me yeah there's nothing that i could say you want
02:46:15 to show cuts getting on this level the reddit is like a very well updated compilation of everything
02:46:21 we do in reverse chrono it all gets posted there and one that we've been kind of meaning to like
02:46:25 make a bigger deal out of we kind of should i guess it doesn't have many subs i just i just i never
02:46:29 read it i don't read it any that's on you guys i go on this the procrastinator subreddit just to
02:46:36 see what you guys have been posting oh really yeah i don't check your individual i just subscribed
02:46:40 everyone i need a good reason to use reddit i haven't found one yet someone made me a reddit for
02:46:45 rebel pixels and i've touched it like twice and i feel like the biggest shit lord who ever lived
02:46:49 because that was like such a nice gesture and i'm just like well i don't fucking know what to do
02:46:54 with it i don't i don't think i don't think like all of my stuff gets posted that channel but all
02:46:59 of it's it's posted to my personal subreddit for sure yeah yeah well i mean there would be like
02:47:04 three times as many posts and no one can find any of it my subreddit is like shockingly very
02:47:08 active like like not just with my content like people post like there's there's like a whole
02:47:13 community on my subreddit that's cool yeah um just of people who i don't know will be asking
02:47:20 something or other or just talking to one of like some people come in there because they hate our
02:47:25 anime so much that they will just have conversations about shows on my subreddit because it's like
02:47:30 people who are kind of like isn't that nice you know that's i mean that's what you need you just
02:47:34 need wouldn't it be great to be the our anime alternative one day i would i would love to
02:47:40 have an all our anime alternative not necessarily for it to be my board because we do like me and
02:47:46 Lachlan who's the mod we do remove like stuff that's not at all relevant to me okay but we'll
02:47:51 leave up like if it's a discussion of like a show that everyone knows i love then like yeah we can
02:47:57 discuss that here you know yeah obviously i'll have something to say that is a tough balancing
02:48:01 act for sure because if you let it go too unfiltered it the original purpose yeah i'm fairly strict
02:48:07 about that i don't want people posting bullshit because yeah it does it gets out of hand immediately
02:48:12 if you let it happen right so it's it's not a good not a good short leash um but i think the the
02:48:18 procrastinator subreddit like the problem is that none of us go on there so no one feels an
02:48:22 incentive to like yeah like i don't i don't know who's reading it it's well updated because rival
02:48:28 steven is fucking you know always post all our shit there and uh and duvou has at some points
02:48:34 paid him to continue doing so really has he wow he's like he's like just thrown him like
02:48:40 ten fifteen dollars just like as a kudos saying like hey well that's nice okay that's that's
02:48:44 different than saying like please keep updating this i'll pay you that's that's how i interpreted
02:48:48 that statement that's on him though i do not endorse that activity no do do it for the love not for
02:48:53 the cash i mean patreon i mean i won't that that guy is pretty dedicated i mean to do it at all
02:48:59 even you know it's super cool yeah he's some he's one of the people who sometimes there's like
02:49:04 there's like a small cabal of people who post all my stuff to my sub because i don't post anything to
02:49:09 my sub it's all my i just don't want to get into any territory we're expected to be paid for this
02:49:13 sort of thing you know absolutely i don't think it would be that way yeah all right uh so i mean
02:49:18 my personal subreddit there there was a guy oh shit i just remembered there was a guy who was
02:49:23 posting all my stuff to my personal subreddit yeah and then he was like i can't do it anymore i was
02:49:27 like cool no problem but then like a week ago or two weeks ago he even he messaged me and was like
02:49:32 i can start it again and i just forgot to ever reply so i should probably tell him yeah i'll
02:49:36 make you a mod again because that was fine i mean i was i had been letting it lie completely
02:49:42 i am in a constant state of feeling bad about people i ignore it is the worst yeah you can't
02:49:49 you can't you can't communicate with everyone that wants to talk to you when you're when you're
02:49:54 this fucking popular bro you can't you can't please everyone you know what i'm saying like it's
02:49:58 not even just everyone who wants to hear from me there's a lot of people i legitimately feel like
02:50:02 i like if i respond to this person i will be happier for having done so and i just don't get
02:50:08 around there's too many fucking people and eventually if like like you sometimes if you
02:50:13 ignore someone enough time is there and they're just gonna stop yeah you're gonna take it the
02:50:16 wrong way yep it's true like we should just make a statement right now it's like at least 70% of
02:50:23 the time i made it i made it to the fucking ecumenical temple you did it ben you did it oh my god
02:50:29 it's level two well it's green not really all it is is just a place where all the gods have altars
02:50:35 except for the one if your life really sucked you didn't find this is actually every single god of
02:50:39 the ready excluded uh actually yeah the ones that aren't here are the ones that are in other places
02:50:44 in the dungeon such as behemoth the one that i wanted which i already found so this is totally
02:50:48 pointless and just symbolic that i'm making progress but how are you at level two yet there
02:50:54 isn't a level two there's only a second area no i'm still in the original area okay would flurry
02:50:59 one of the ecumenical temple is debatably a second area but like there's very little actually there
02:51:03 yeah are there any like actual dividers or just all kind of yeah there yeah there is there's like
02:51:08 special portals that lead to different regions and different regions have later regions will
02:51:14 like each have a rune in them right yeah so you should alter to an unknown god oh
02:51:22 you cannot you cannot tell which altar this god belongs to convert to them anyway
02:51:28 actually you know what i just realized i'm glad like i was getting worried because the problem
02:51:33 that i've been having at rad con so far and have had in the past uh with everyone forever
02:51:39 including me and ben working out is that uh it's really hard to schedule around people who
02:51:45 sleep at different times yes like because you're thinking of it as like we'll do this tomorrow
02:51:50 but my tomorrow is very different from your tomorrow and for a second here i was worried
02:51:54 because i was like oh fuck it's already like uh it's already like five in the morning i'm
02:51:58 gonna wake up so late but then i remembered that the main people i'm watching with tomorrow
02:52:02 are you two so it's perfectly fine oh is that true okay yes i'm mostly scheduled around you guys
02:52:07 like like i gotta do that one fucking movie with jeff right and jesse and then i'm gonna watch a show
02:52:12 with you and then i'm gonna do some of you know i've got you for two episodes as well yeah okay
02:52:17 i feel a little bad when when jeff when you and jeff came in and were like everybody quiet down
02:52:23 i i don't know i didn't like jeff's tone and i kind of gave him like a scathing look uh i feel
02:52:27 like maybe i just don't know the guy and didn't read his tone the way he meant to be read i felt
02:52:32 like he was being a real dick but i don't know i don't tend to be funny what okay well it did
02:52:38 not come considering he said hey fuck heads shut up for a second we gotta take this show maybe i
02:52:44 should have just assumed it was a joke when you when you get when you get cross like maybe you
02:52:49 should say something just to clear the air well i didn't i didn't like say anything i just looked
02:52:54 at him like what is your deal man i don't know well i should have us i don't know i'm being i'm
02:53:01 being cool i i had told him to go like i said uh we gotta like i said we gotta go make those guys
02:53:07 shut up so we could do this show yeah so don't worry i'll take care of it it was did you tell
02:53:13 you to shut up be a he was he was probably just joking and i just like wasn't in the mood to hear
02:53:18 he might he might be overestimating the uh how impressed we are by his uh by his presence um
02:53:27 he is a famous youtube guy you know he's he's quite active on the youtube he does quite well
02:53:35 be on that point and yet you're still making videos make your novel i don't it's not that i
02:53:42 don't care about youtube i'm saying i don't care about youtuber oh yeah no i do care about youtube
02:53:47 it's uh i thought you were done with youtube i i make a bunch of videos about that you were
02:53:52 done with youtube i make a bunch of i'd say a lot of things that i know i see i actually it's funny
02:53:58 i just recorded a um a sort of solo uh decompression video it's all about my inability to make choices
02:54:06 is it for rumble pixels it was going to be for procrastinators okay i did it last night
02:54:12 everyone's just done this but like yeah i i'm still resistant to doing it you don't have to do it
02:54:17 i would rather put a video like that on my own channel feel free to i don't know if i'm going
02:54:21 to post it at all because i did it when i was like still like really not feeling well so i'm not like
02:54:26 super energized about it it's just really funny and it might just be like super fucking gay just
02:54:31 like it's weird because when i made the decompression chamber i expected it to be a video
02:54:36 that none of you guys would watch yeah because it's it's totally very similar to my afterdark
02:54:41 videos that most of you guys don't pay attention to but weirdly everyone seems to be into them
02:54:46 and like everyone seems to listen to them it's it's the it might be because it's on procrastinators
02:54:51 i can absolutely explain why this is happening it's because when you go to afterdark you're
02:54:55 presented with so much fucking shit you feel overwhelmed that's just the way the human mind
02:55:00 if it's just one video a week where it's just like i'm going to be a faggot now
02:55:03 yeah we can we can deal with one one dose of fagotry but if you just like literally take
02:55:08 a shit on the channel constantly i mean like it wasn't it wasn't too surprising that ben listened
02:55:13 to just just so everyone knows i have butchered a human and am currently eating them good good
02:55:19 to know that's all i wanted out of this we've crossed the threshold like i wasn't survival mandates
02:55:25 certain uh extremes uh wait wait wait wait wait look uh yes this uh this raw flesh tastes terrible
02:55:31 it says well you know yeah it's it's you it always tastes terrible it's hard to eat raw meat you can
02:55:38 only eat raw butchered meat when you're really hungry unless you find an amulet of the gormand
02:55:42 which lets you just fucking stuff yourself on everyone's carcasses until you're like
02:55:46 you're actually a really good item because spell use casting spells like takes food energy
02:55:53 okay how do you how do you prepare cooked items you can't cook them you you can i you either you
02:55:59 find like permanent prepared food that lasts forever or you just eat raw food there's no cooking
02:56:05 this has brought me to an interesting thought uh which is that there's a big difference between
02:56:12 consuming and engaging with content right yeah for sure and and it's interesting to me because i
02:56:18 when i think of people who watch all my videos i think of like people like lachlan again who
02:56:23 who know everything about me and know all this history but there's plenty of people who do watch
02:56:28 all my videos and just don't care that much and ben is one of them because uh well i mean i care
02:56:36 you care sometimes why would you leave a comment when you could just go upstairs like that video
02:56:41 was gay and just go back well i mean it was before that ben ben consumes a lot of my content while
02:56:46 like drawing yeah just like having it on in the background and like i mean you watch like most of
02:56:52 the after dark stuff right i not recently but in the past i have and like like victor watches
02:56:59 everything i put out just because he's bored and sits on the couch but he plays 3ds do the whole
02:57:04 thing so he like kind of vaguely like victor's response to the vast majority of my videos forever
02:57:10 has always been well i hear you talk about this stuff all the time in real life so uh so it doesn't
02:57:16 that's a fair point so um so so like on the one hand you've got like davoo who will you know who's
02:57:23 actually way behind on my videos and has not listened has not listened to most of the after
02:57:28 dark or decompression stuff he basically doesn't watch youtube at all anymore like all he does he's
02:57:32 too busy working i guess all he does is watch anime and edit yeah um i mean like he's dedicated
02:57:38 dedicated himself to the cause the way it's it's really interesting to me because he thinks of
02:57:43 watching anime as work yeah like he thinks of it as i have to watch this i feel like my comment
02:57:48 in response to that guy who told you that you watching anime can't be work was very yeah that
02:57:53 that summed up all my thoughts on but but it's funny because like i don't think of watching anime
02:57:58 as work even though it's like it contributes to it because to me it only becomes work when it's
02:58:02 directly contributing to a video whereas davoo thinks that all anime he's watching is work and
02:58:08 therefore he yeah he has mentioned on many occasions how he wants to see every anime so
02:58:14 that he is more capable of making these videos fast but but in the way that like you and i've
02:58:19 been watching for a long time how dedicated he is to that because yeah all the time that he's not
02:58:23 editing for me he just watches anime well you know you know what that's because we live that's
02:58:28 because we haven't made the big move to the city yet and we're all still fucking we're all we're all
02:58:32 boring here and there's nothing else to do well because he gets part of it he he sees it it's like
02:58:38 i'm not like okay um he has all these other things he wants to work on video games and the reason he's
02:58:43 not working on them is because he's working by watching anime sounds like procrastination
02:58:49 to me it seems that way but he doesn't treat it that way like he thinks like watching anime is more
02:58:54 important to his career than doing those other things and then like doing those would be procrastination
02:58:59 realign your uh your interests and your priorities yeah i'm not the one to say that but i mean he's
02:59:06 doing good work he's he's he's doing great because like because the thing is that like uh close to a
02:59:11 year ago i gave him like a google doc of like every show i thought there was a chance i would talk about
02:59:16 at any point in the near future it was like probably a hundred shows and he's most of the
02:59:20 way through that list and he's made it out like you know i'll stop watching anime constantly
02:59:24 when i've broken this list uh with the the ironic part is that i actually he didn't even notice this
02:59:30 and i forgot until like like a couple weeks ago that uh it was an alphabetical list and it just
02:59:36 stops in the middle of the letter s because i just got tired of making it and never got back to it
02:59:41 so he's been like watching all these shows all this time and i looked at it and i was like
02:59:44 devu this list could be like you know like this is like two-thirds of what would be the list you
02:59:49 know so uh you know i can't i don't know if he wants me to write out the rest or if he'll just
02:59:54 be like well you know you gave me the list i'm gonna do that list if his goals have a thorough
02:59:58 understanding of anime in general watching a hundred shows or so is a very good start so he's
03:00:03 probably watched over 150 in the last six months you know what his secret plan is he's just training
03:00:09 under you right now and then like this time next year he's gonna start digivoo and just fucking
03:00:14 uh i've offered to have him put videos on my channel in the past yeah like to just do his
03:00:21 anime videos there um make sense try to remember why i was talking oh yeah the engagement thing
03:00:26 right that like devu's way behind on my content but when he watches that he's extremely engaged
03:00:33 like he soaks in every detail of it that's the most valuable thing you can whereas like like
03:00:38 ben watches most of my stuff hippo watches almost all of the stuff i put out like he always has
03:00:44 consumed like just about every single thing i put out but doesn't really care about much of it like he
03:00:50 doesn't really care about the things i'm talking about so like he just kind of goes in one ear
03:00:54 not the other and like every once in a while he picks up some intriguing things victor watches
03:00:58 all of it doesn't care but like but with the decompression chambers it's like everyone seems
03:01:04 to be listening to it and like uh you know why you know why because i live with you and i hear
03:01:09 yeah it's because we might hear about ourselves that's a big element i've never gone in thinking
03:01:17 i'd be talked about i've definitely done it all the time it's just weird because i definitely
03:01:23 watched the pcp to hear myself how fucking dumb i did or i'm so used to nobody being engaged or
03:01:29 really caring and then like i've been like people keep talking to me about the decompression chambers
03:01:34 and being like oh yeah what you talked about in this one and i'm like wait you listened to me
03:01:39 for an hour and a half i'm the boring like i think of myself as the boring guy in the pcp
03:01:44 really really because i'm not funny everyone else is funny i'm not funny i'm the boring guy at all
03:01:50 i mean i don't know man i mean you're not ha ha funny my main channel content in particular is
03:01:55 not funny well yeah like like like like you guys all like you and nate jesse and hippo who are like
03:02:02 the trifecta of extremely funny people like i feel like you guys really value a video being funny
03:02:08 true and my videos aren't funny so they are not valuable you know like my videos have always been
03:02:13 like i feel like everyone kind of thinks like yeah his don't really matter they're just fucking his
03:02:19 random thoughts that he puts out there i don't know so people tell me like i listened to an hour
03:02:23 and a half of you just literally talking about yourself usually like this strange mix of self
03:02:29 aggrandizement and self peril uh i'm like what you listened to that twice like you know like
03:02:38 more like more than one episode yeah and then everyone just started making their own and and
03:02:43 like i guess we all liked it like did it it's interesting because like my my channel like
03:02:48 talk about engagement is that like i did all these like videos on reviewing tablets i was like
03:02:53 there's people telling me free stuff why would i not do it yeah yeah but like the channel is
03:02:57 written is on to be just like art sucks and this is why like don't do this and like and those are
03:03:03 the ones that get way more engagement i'm just like they don't get a lot of views but everybody who
03:03:07 watches them gets something really like important out of it yeah so i'm just like they're very personal
03:03:12 for people they're so hard to make though because i feel like i'm just a bitch every time i make
03:03:16 i can't do that it's so hard i gotta tell you what what your channel reminds me of more than
03:03:21 anything um i know we've talked about this scene before and welcome to the nhk it's one of my favorite
03:03:27 scenes which is have you seen welcome to the nhk i've seen the first two episodes watch the whole
03:03:31 thing you know the general concept it's about a hikikomori uh you know and there's a part later
03:03:37 in the show there's this one arc where he meets another hikikomori yeah and it's like through
03:03:42 like it was like a girl what was his connection to that girl how did he know her she was i believe
03:03:46 a classmate who he met again later like it's like a classmate that he that he had in high school
03:03:50 and she's become like a part of a pyramid scheme she tries to like rope them in and then you find
03:03:55 out that the reason is she's she was the class rep i think yeah whatever she's trying to make money
03:04:00 like because she has to take care of her brother because her brother's a fucking shut in and is
03:04:04 and is a hikikomori in her room and um there's a scene where they go up to the brother's room
03:04:11 and he's like saying like there's no way out of this and he says i've read every self-help book
03:04:19 there is you can see them all on the shelves i could write one but i can't get out of it
03:04:26 and that's what your channel is to me it's a man who has read every self-help book knows all the
03:04:32 advice and is literally giving it to other people in spite of the fact that you cannot follow it
03:04:37 yourself and are dying yeah i mean no i'm like literally dying yeah he is literally dying he has
03:04:44 an ulcer in his fucking stomach and he's dying yeah uh out of just stress from art from this
03:04:51 exact thing there's nothing physically wrong with me and your channel is like here's how to get out
03:04:57 of that even though you are not out of that but it is all the right advice it's all the correct
03:05:04 the idea behind the channel right now and like what i want to kind of do more than if i can stop
03:05:07 being a little baby about it is that i don't want i wanted to be like being very honest in my
03:05:13 presentation like i'm going to give you advice i'm not the best artist in the world in fact i'm
03:05:17 probably like the lower like 25 percent if i'm going to be realistic true and that you're definitely
03:05:23 wrong being being publishable puts you in the upper 25 for like the the highest 25 i mean you
03:05:30 people have paid for your art that puts you in the upper 25 percent people paid for Reki Kawahara's
03:05:36 work would you put him in the upper 25 and all these ways to lower your value people aren't
03:05:41 really paying for Reki Kawahara they're paying for abec's character design that's true that guy is
03:05:45 the brother of the woman who designed kaon which means he has royal blood in his veins
03:05:52 no but like the idea is like i'm not well put together and like i wanted to kind of be like
03:05:58 you don't have to be a dude with like a bajillion subscribers and like supremely like god gifted
03:06:03 talent like that's just like emanates from everything you do right in order to to be successful
03:06:10 yeah it's amazing to me that you understand that what you cannot make yourself that's the whole
03:06:15 thing is like it's like everything i understand logically exactly what i need to do and how to
03:06:20 do it but like it's an emotional reaction that's beyond my control right so i literally like
03:06:25 with people like oh you need to need to just like get better like i go to therapists like well
03:06:29 you understand all these things i'm like yeah but like that doesn't look you just need to start
03:06:33 thinking more positively i'm like i have the same conversation with my therapist every week for like
03:06:37 two months like you just need to start thinking more pros like i get that yeah but i you you
03:06:42 you have clearly shown that you understand how to fix these problems because all the advice you
03:06:46 give is great yeah like the rebel pixels channel i've shared those videos and been like everyone
03:06:51 should do this you know you just haven't done it i just need a partial lobotomy and then i'll be fine
03:06:59 that might actually be true you know i mean i i felt when like that that what inspired me so much
03:07:05 about that particular chapter and like what happens in that the only way he gets out of it is that
03:07:10 eventually his sister just fucking leaves him and like he literally can't survive in his room anymore
03:07:15 dude so he has to get a job so funny because i did the video i just made about the decompressed
03:07:19 thing about choices saying how like it started like a i had like a self-help book i talked about
03:07:24 how people are more happy when they feel they're in control even if they're not because they did
03:07:30 the psychology experiment where um they they designed the most mundane game possible and brought
03:07:35 a bunch of people into play it was basically a number between one and ten would come up and they
03:07:39 had to guess would be greater or lower than five that was the entire game they had to do it for
03:07:43 like three hours and they found um that they would test it in two ways the first way was that you
03:07:49 hit a button for a higher or lower and then the second test would be a computer would decide for
03:07:55 you so you would they would the computer would pick one of the buttons and they found that
03:08:00 when you chose it you're were more excited you're more invested and when you the computer did you
03:08:04 were fucking bored sure then and they they the people were told they were being tested for
03:08:09 accuracy so like you're going to find out how good you are at this then they stopped they
03:08:14 touted the results and they told everybody who participated we lied to you everyone got the
03:08:19 exact same pattern of right and wrong there was no way you could beat this pattern and then they
03:08:24 sat them down and did it again and they still got more excited having the choice even though they knew
03:08:30 it was total bullshit their primitive dumb fucking animal brain got fucking psyched over like the
03:08:36 possibility of being right like having that control over the situation even though there was none and
03:08:41 so that was like the thing it's just like people are fucking stupid and you have to make choices
03:08:45 and then i go into like i don't make any choices like i'm so reactionary at this point because
03:08:51 i'm like a people pleaser that i don't do any of that like every time i even make a choice i just
03:08:56 like caught myself like did i make the right choice and then it's like i'm like thinking like i need
03:09:00 to i'm getting kicked out of my house now and i feel like maybe i secretly wanted to get kicked out
03:09:04 for years because then i have to start doing exactly what happens to the character he i'm literally
03:09:09 an anime by a way of getting by way of his fucking sister just like being like i'm sick of this and
03:09:15 abandoning him like one day because he would like bang on the floor to get her to bring food and like
03:09:19 he's begging on the floor and she's not coming and like a whole day passes and he's just like
03:09:24 i'm gonna die if i don't leave my room and i'll get food and so he leaves and he gets a part time
03:09:29 job and it's implied that he uh is happier having done that um but like for me that was a huge eye
03:09:36 opener because i watched that show when i was in the middle of you know fucking half a decade of
03:09:40 depression and i was like fuck me like what's clear like what became clear to me at the tail end of
03:09:48 being depressed was like again i read all the self-help books i heard all the advice and none of it
03:09:54 was working so i i told to my parents like i need medication because i i like my dad is the type
03:10:02 of person if you tell me you're depressed he's like well if you just gotta think of it this way
03:10:05 you just gotta do this i'm like i know i know i did the research i went online i typed how do you
03:10:10 cure depression none of that worked so clearly there's gotta be something else here like there's
03:10:17 i'm i'm fighting as hard as i can i'm doing all the things you're telling me and it's not working
03:10:22 so we need to kick this up a notch you know this needs to be different and maybe getting kicked out
03:10:28 would have worked for me i mean it wouldn't have put me in this situation for sure so i'm very
03:10:32 glad it didn't happen uh but like you know like i eventually they took me to a psychologist i got
03:10:39 medicated i got better you know like that's kind of what all the fucking people are saying to me too
03:10:44 just like your brain could just legitimately be fucked up yeah like and i mean i'm i'm lucky that
03:10:49 it worked for me because like victor who went through you know the same kind of depression
03:10:54 went through like six different medications and none of them worked some of them made him way worse
03:10:58 and he eventually just gave up and said i'm just gonna be depressed for the rest of my life
03:11:02 you know uh and his depression only finally stopped being like a constant force when he hooked up
03:11:10 with his current girlfriend and now he's like like the first time i've ever seen him legitimately
03:11:16 happy um he used to be so angry like he was angry all the time he would snap on you for anything
03:11:22 and ever since he started dating he's just been like fucking blissed out all the time i guess when
03:11:26 they just say you need to get laid it's totally true that's more than that it's i mean he was in
03:11:32 love with joke mate he was obsessed with her for a long time he has uh victor was telling us about
03:11:38 this uh this amazing book idea he has and i want it's so good it's so fucking good really his book
03:11:44 idea ever which is just the title it's a coffee table book that folds out into a coffee table
03:11:50 the book the book is called um how to find the love of your life in seven easy years no it's how
03:11:58 to get out of the friend zone in seven easy years right either way that's a very clickbaity titling
03:12:03 i love it that is that is like a buzz people are gonna like that shit seven easy years though
03:12:09 yeah no that's great that's a great title because that's how long it took him to get out of the
03:12:13 friends i i imagine all right all right everyone update update i am being i am being rampaged upon
03:12:20 by an ogre and a herd of yaks a herd of yaks are coming out oh god this dungeon has no fucking
03:12:26 chill no no this this is this is escalated what's that golden man there that is an ogre that's the
03:12:33 ogre okay he just has some yellow are you just fleeing for life i'm just looks like my only choice
03:12:38 is to go down these stairs and just see what see what happens um all right what the fuck is that
03:12:44 a purple ugly thing all right oh god they put me in the game you know uh i i also experienced
03:12:54 some tough some feelings similar to this at one point uh when i had when i had finished my four
03:13:00 years at school and i was back home and was doing these shitty media labor jobs while uh just like
03:13:08 taking like one class a semester and dreaming of one day finishing my degree and leaving i would
03:13:13 kind of like antagonize my parents every once in a while i really think i was trying to get them
03:13:18 to kick me out and like occasionally i would say that like if i'm fucking up so bad why just kick
03:13:23 me out and uh i think i was it was a cry for help i cannot imagine you saying that at all
03:13:29 that seems really weird you can ask dad i i like i would bring it up sometimes about like well maybe
03:13:35 if you kicked me out it wouldn't be a big problem uh but of course i was terrified of that notion
03:13:40 because i've never done anything by myself in my entire life i'm like half freak out mode half
03:13:45 like just whatever complacency i think is the biggest problem for our generation it's horrible
03:13:50 and like that's it's exactly why i talked about this in the decompression chamber that's why the
03:13:55 decompression chamber exists is because like i i hate the idea of like my content always being
03:14:02 the same yeah because the second i fall into a cycle of doing the same thing all the time
03:14:06 everything falls apart like mentally that's when i because i just become like i'm not even making
03:14:11 progress and it's so easy it's so easy to just be like well this makes me a baseline amount of money
03:14:18 so let's just keep doing that forever and then like nothing improves that's how everything gets
03:14:24 shit you know that's literally how everything gets shit like i feel like i have to constantly
03:14:28 challenge myself to come up with something new and it always pays off like you know the only way
03:14:32 to make something like grow is to like if things aren't getting any better at like they're just
03:14:38 staying the same and you want them to get better something has to change you know you can't just
03:14:42 do the same thing forever and hope that it's gonna change by itself you know it just feels like like
03:14:47 to me i don't know how often i talk about it but it's just whatever i think about how in like like
03:14:53 three years ago when i started doing the thing that actually interests me making videos i just
03:14:58 found this well within myself of an ability to do shit that i had never had before in my entire life
03:15:05 and an incredible drive to do it that i had never experienced before and i feel like that was me
03:15:11 finally being a real person for the first time like i always had an ability and i just you know
03:15:17 there it was i just needed something to do that hill giant could very easily have just killed it
03:15:22 truly was a hill giant in my life that i put against such eloquent terms what what are we talking
03:15:28 about i know the feeling just because like you know i've said i've said everything before yeah but
03:15:35 uh like for for so long i thought i was going to be either a filmmaker or a writer or all these other
03:15:43 things that like that like i that i wanted to do and the reason i'm not those is because i just didn't
03:15:48 do them yeah i would talk about them all the time i'd said like every single day i would like give
03:15:55 myself a pep talk about how i was gonna be a director and how i was gonna like run away from
03:15:59 home and make movies and like become this renegade director homeless man i guess and like like i talked
03:16:07 about it constantly and i directed nothing yeah i never made a fucking movie you know and like
03:16:14 quentin tarantino and fucking uh what's his name robert rodriguez had like this book or um well
03:16:20 robert rodriguez had a book about this but tarantino and him talked about this at a panel somewhere
03:16:24 yeah where they were like tarantino like very clearly laid out these rules for how to become a
03:16:29 director he said every day of the week i'm on fire every day of the week write scripts and on the
03:16:36 weekend shoot the scripts that's it that's all you have to do right every day and on the weekend
03:16:42 shoot the scripts you just wrote you're done you're a director just do that for several years you'll
03:16:47 be great you'll eventually get great right and i read that and i was like yeah wrote no scripts
03:16:52 directed no movies continued to talk about it for years yeah um you know and i did write a novel
03:16:59 but i immediately abandoned it when i realized that editing it would be a chore um so like that's
03:17:04 funny because editing is my favorite part of writing that's when you you're gonna be a successful
03:17:07 writer congratulations you take something that sucks and you make it less sucky i wrote my novel
03:17:13 in a month and then i never looked at it again the best part is when you find a sense like i can make
03:17:17 it better by doing this and then you get instantly erect and it's like i know i love that in my analysis
03:17:22 writing and that's the thing like like all this time the whole we are completely opposite about
03:17:26 writing because every time i write a script i do like one pass i'm like meh it's fine the whole
03:17:31 the entire time that i was talking about being a director that saw him up being a writer that whole
03:17:36 time i was writing an anime blog in the background just because i wanted to do it yeah right just for
03:17:41 fun didn't think it was going anywhere just hey yeah oh i watched the shot let's talk about that
03:17:46 it'll be funny i think about this all the time because all the time just like because i'm like
03:17:50 i really want to just write i want to just tell stories i wanted to be a son of a little kid
03:17:54 and like i've just everything has been like what medium do i want to do it in because like i've
03:17:57 still written it's like i'm gonna make fucking video games and that didn't work because i was
03:18:00 fucking complicated so it's like i'll do animation and like i don't like that and then like it's i've
03:18:05 been going lower and lower and lower down to writing and like my mind has always been like i
03:18:10 can write easily so that clearly that means it's not hard it doesn't doesn't count it's a lesser form
03:18:15 that is the absolute worst way you could have interpreted exactly because i'm fucking retarded
03:18:20 so even now i feel like i'm not living up to my potential by just writing um which is dumb cut that
03:18:25 shit out because i personally i like i feel like i have more core respect for writing than anything
03:18:32 i do too because like all the other like even if you're your favorite fucking like tv show or
03:18:37 video game would suck dick if the writer didn't show up because it's like look at these pretty
03:18:40 graphics sitting there like jerking off got them i mean i think like i think that uh like you know
03:18:48 a just an image can convey an incredible amount of storytelling and like or just an animation
03:18:54 could um but like the level at which you're like doing a 22 episode animation uh 12 times right
03:19:03 like yeah you need something like like like the only way that's gonna have a deep meaningful thing
03:19:09 to it is if someone spends forever making those images perfect the thing that like to change my
03:19:16 my mind said like i think i just need to write is that every because i would do comics and stuff
03:19:19 and i would sit down i'd write the script in like two or three weeks tops it'd be super because
03:19:25 there's not a lot to it it's just like this is the picture i want and this is what i want them to
03:19:28 say it's basically what i mean i mean i'm not gonna not to say that that's easy but like the writing
03:19:33 part always came easy to me and then like it'd be like three months of drawing it and the entire
03:19:36 time i feel like i'm not doing anything it's just like well i already know what's supposed to happen
03:19:40 yeah that's that's how it feels when i'm just inking in the pages i've already sketched i don't
03:19:44 feel creative at all doing it it just feels like busy work and a fucking chore i actually really
03:19:48 enjoy inking just because again it's the same thing with editing it's like it's taking the shitty
03:19:52 drawing and making it look fucking cool hey but ben's stuff it's satisfying in a way but ben's
03:19:56 actually a good artist so miss sketches don't look like a mess of retarded no my sketches look
03:20:00 horrible my sketches are like garbage well the thing about ben's inking is that he basically
03:20:05 just redraws it he does you can you pretty much just like completely redraws do it all in black
03:20:11 yeah that's what i that's what it's it's not my my sketches are just like like literally like
03:20:16 everywhere and then i just take it and i take that mess and just make it one nice clean line
03:20:20 and then he gets me nice and nice and tighten the pants because it's fucking it looks cool yeah i
03:20:25 i guess i do something like that but the the penciling's the worst because i have no like
03:20:29 understanding of like perspective or form so i just sit there and just like
03:20:34 i just want to have the hand out what the fuck they're selling me some books dude they're selling
03:20:38 me some fucking books is my book there is in the future no is your is yours book the fen folio
03:20:44 that was the sequel is it perhaps the papyrus of beguiling
03:20:47 uh well i really there was this one undertale thick i wrote all right i got it i want magma
03:20:53 bolt i'm gonna see if i'm gonna have to fucking consult the way for you undertale thick no it said
03:20:58 papyrus i wasn't sure no uh anyway for me writing an analysis video like the only analog for it
03:21:10 for me it is literally the same feeling as jacking off and then just like arnold described
03:21:17 for me it is exactly like what arnold described with the pump is one to one how i feel writing
03:21:23 an analysis script and it's really easy for well i will make a comparison sort of like that when i'm
03:21:28 editing a nuzlocke specifically i feel exactly the same as if i'm just sitting there passively
03:21:34 consuming a video like editing a video that i made to me just feels like sitting and listening to
03:21:40 my video over and over again which is something i love to do is listening to my own videos and looking
03:21:47 at my own drawings is like my favorite activity that stimulates me more than anything else it is a
03:21:52 lot of that's how i feel about all my vlogs like i make i make it and it's like it's kind of fun
03:21:58 and then i watch it back and it's like yeah okay that's a fun video i'd watch it if somebody else
03:22:02 made it you know and uh i did yeah and i watch it like six more times because i feel like it uh
03:22:08 and then forget about it forever but like with with writing the like and i guess this is why
03:22:13 because it so something i've been struggling with lately is the idea that my main channel
03:22:18 content is not really worth more than my vlogs like in terms of like people are getting almost as
03:22:24 much out of some not all of them some of the blogs are fucking retarded but like i need to
03:22:30 there are certain videos i've made that like and i get people telling me this all the time like
03:22:34 people come onto my reddit and are always like did you write to dark is your real main channel
03:22:38 like i care way more about the content on there than the main channel because it's way more videos
03:22:43 covering way broader subject matter and i've gotten out like so many fucking opinions on what you're
03:22:48 doing right now is you're basically doing a sales funnel with free content yeah it's yeah exactly i'm
03:22:54 just like i'm just fucking throwing it out like all the stuff that could be i'm making like ten
03:22:59 dollars a piece on these and they could be like uh every week i could just have a patreon post that's
03:23:05 just a compilation of a bunch of logs and i don't know if people would value it any less than the
03:23:09 main channel content you know the thing is like like people don't want to lose like whenever i bring
03:23:14 this up people are like well i don't want to lose the main channel content because i still value it
03:23:18 but that doesn't mean that i don't also value these as much well i think like you have to understand
03:23:24 like the levels of people like uh your your your top level is you have digi bro yes that's like your
03:23:29 267 000 retards you follow yeah and they're that's them well that's that's that's like the the most
03:23:38 easy to find shit like that's why it's so successful is because it's it's searchable it's you're playing
03:23:43 the game like we've talked about this before and then you have after dark which is like people want
03:23:47 to go a little bit deeper and then but like the people who are like the most hardcore yeah are
03:23:51 patrons yeah exactly they are the ones who give the most of a fuck because they're giving me money
03:23:55 i only have like 500 patrons like you should be 250 000 subscribers right 500 those are the
03:24:02 people's dicks you want to suck yeah and and none of them well i don't think i don't necessarily
03:24:07 agree with that i don't i don't think it's good to only appeal to your core no i'm not saying only
03:24:13 appeal to them or i don't i don't think it's good to to to to i mean prioritize them a little but
03:24:18 yeah not well i mean like like jesse makes as much money as i do on patreon practically like well
03:24:25 okay no never mind please forgive what i just said that was true once i make i make a lot more now
03:24:32 than he does but but only because i mean because he's still charging weekly no i charge per video
03:24:39 like oh my god you must make a killing i change everything monthly i only put out like three
03:24:45 four videos a month and then sometimes like a fifth bonus thing i feel like anyone starting
03:24:50 patreon now you can't do that anymore uh i don't know about that man i don't like i don't know about
03:24:55 that attitude because like patreon had already been going for a while when we jumped in everybody
03:24:59 who's no because when we uh when we all started you couldn't do monthly things yeah you could
03:25:04 not not in the beginning it was always there no it was not really no when i made it i don't remember
03:25:09 monthly it was only per creation that was added later oh i hear a distance snort that means there's
03:25:14 a labyrinth here with a minotaur and the uh the thing is everybody's doing monthly and that's what
03:25:20 they expect like all the big channels that run patreon i despise monthly because to me and monthly's
03:25:25 games fuck to me like never to me the whole point of it is that i have to make videos agree you know
03:25:30 and i have i get paid for exactly how much work i do and that's like what incentivizes me to make
03:25:35 more the problem i'm gonna die people get scared when it's per video because i don't know how much
03:25:40 they're gonna pay for and then you have to put that bigger shoes not gonna put you can put a cap
03:25:43 and blah blah but if you say month it's like oh i'm making 12 payments a year i'm extremely careful
03:25:49 and i'm very clear about what you're gonna get if you pay for per video you know but like um i think
03:25:55 but at the same time i feel like that's like kind of in some ways i'm throwing like i make these posts
03:26:02 at the end of like every other month where it's like all the unpatroned videos in one post and
03:26:07 it's like 40 videos that i'm putting in one post some of which are my favorite videos i made that
03:26:14 that month you know and i'm like am i really like considering this like all like all 40 of these
03:26:21 are only worth as much as one main channel videos some of which are like six minutes long and not
03:26:26 that interesting you know compared to some of these blogs it's really dumb but but the reason
03:26:30 i feel that way the reason this distinction exists is because the vlogs i like i make it and it's
03:26:37 just like yeah that was fun and the videos are literally masturbating it's like this is this
03:26:43 is oh no this is what i want my life to be you know snorke snorke killed me while i was trying to
03:26:50 run up the stairs to get away from him what it sucks oh that was really dumb i thought i could
03:26:57 take i had been i had been i had been wrecking shit because i got a ring of magic power that
03:27:02 gave me extra mp and i had finally gotten enough piety with that who met that he had started to
03:27:06 do the best thing he does which is restore your mp every time you kill something with magic so you
03:27:11 can just kill kill kill kill and it all just it all just you'd become like a steamroller of
03:27:17 magical death so i had i had kind of been having that going for a while but i got overconfident
03:27:22 and i find snorke fucking snorke man what a dick yeah he's someone draw a fan out of snorke
03:27:28 he's just like a really he's just like a really strong troll and he's also really fat and ugly
03:27:32 he's particularly ugly i think that's in his description he must go on youtube
03:27:37 yeah but yeah uh i guess i guess the long and short of what i'm describing is that i am making
03:27:46 the mistake of putting like like basing how much my content is valued like like what value i'm
03:27:54 putting on it in a public sense of like what people are charging me based on how much i value my
03:27:59 content and that's the mistake i'm making yeah it's not i'm not basing it on how much my content
03:28:04 is valued by other people but just strictly like i think writing a post is fun and the feelings it
03:28:11 gives me are like i've accomplished something right you know like if i write if i write something
03:28:16 like that that flying witch video which is like you know six and a half minutes and i wrote it all
03:28:20 at once like in one night it's not a thought i'd ever really had before and i just came up with it
03:28:24 all but the process of writing it was like oh yeah i'm fucking coming and then it's like yeah
03:28:31 that's a patron video whereas there's like vlogs i have where i'm like summarizing the whole fucking
03:28:36 universe and like all of anime history and it's like this is life changing for some people
03:28:42 and and i'm like yeah throw it into the the fucking pile with the 40 other vlogs you know
03:28:47 well would you want to improve the production values on the vlogs of vlog type content if you
03:28:52 were going to make it a main channel thing i definitely am going to do that but i don't think
03:28:56 i'll ever i don't know if i'll ever be able to bring myself to patron it you know like like maybe
03:29:01 the yuri on ice video that me and victor recorded which is going on the main channel
03:29:05 it's basically like a plebeian the lead discussion it's me and him sitting chairs we discuss yuri
03:29:09 on ice uh i'm even gonna have devout edit it and put a bunch of footage in so it should be
03:29:15 patronable but even then i'm just like but it's not written you know like what value could there
03:29:20 possibly be in something i didn't write there's a few moments where i say um in this like how
03:29:28 could anyone pay money for something where i say the weirdest fucking comment and it blew my mind
03:29:33 and i was just like it changed the way i'm gonna do videos on rebel pixels and because i got a
03:29:37 bunch of thumbs up too because i i did these last two videos that are about um why i think you like
03:29:43 youtube is a symptom of a bigger problem and shit yeah yeah that was a great yeah and and someone
03:29:49 said to me i really like this video but i can't get into it because it's scripted i hate your
03:29:53 scripting voice it sounds super unnatural i'd rather you just talk and like it got like 15
03:29:59 thumb ups like we were just like weird well i mean i i do understand that like i can there are there
03:30:05 are normies the idea normies want you to be a normie uh yeah and sometimes you have to appease
03:30:13 them i guess it's so weird like all the videos that get the best responses in terms of engagement
03:30:18 not in views but engagement are always the ones where i'm just like uh i mean fucking i guess like
03:30:25 dick sucking sure like that's that's the kind of language that people seem to really resonate
03:30:31 i mean i mean if that's if they knew what my dick looked like they'd want to suck it for sure
03:30:35 if that's the truth then i guess it makes sense to go for that kind of content because like i think
03:30:40 on rebel pixels this year i'm not gonna script anything real real quick can we all appreciate
03:30:44 that for like how long has this been going three three and a half hours now tom has been non-stop
03:30:51 shitting on his appearance and abilities but when it came to his dick he was like i mean if they saw
03:30:56 my dick they would definitely want to suck it so i think this man must be a monster i think yeah i
03:31:02 think we can say that tom has something to be confident about i just have the opinions of other
03:31:07 people who are very clear yeah see that's exactly the kind of thing you'd say if you had a fucking nine
03:31:15 inch dick i don't know put your hand up to mine for a second oh my god it's a pretty big hand it's a
03:31:24 pretty big hand it's a huge hand i don't i don't know well that was a diversion it sure was sorry
03:31:34 what were you saying tom um before i got out i was i was saying did you hear what i said when you
03:31:39 left yeah youtube uh sucks so the value to i gotta tell you that people want your your something about
03:31:46 the owl something about the owl i've gotten the same thing i've gotten the same thing that people
03:31:50 people tell me all the time like i really need your unscripted content because it feels like
03:31:54 i'm having a conversation with somebody you know but do you think about that that's the entire
03:31:59 fucking reason youtube took off in the first place because it wasn't all like this fucking production
03:32:04 and like we kind of are forgetting that because we want to be cool all the big guys are vloggers
03:32:09 all the biggest youtubers are fucking vloggers that doesn't mean well i mean what about guys like
03:32:15 PewDiePie vlogger now i'm not talking about doesn't play video games anymore just vlogs that's true i
03:32:20 meant guys like uh best guy ever dammit i can't remember the fucking name of these guys what's
03:32:26 the guy who made the the thing about the politics videos about the animal kingdom that guy cgp
03:32:31 like cgp gray's content i think is really good generally and it's scripted and i'm just saying
03:32:37 that there is a market no there's absolutely a market but i i think there are lots of people
03:32:41 out there who appreciate shit like we're doing right now i guess so i think here's the thing
03:32:45 about cgp gray though like his main channel content which is phenomenal yeah and is very
03:32:53 successful um but like i don't think he'd have a patreon that's as successful as he did if not for
03:32:59 the hello internet podcast because people know him damn like that's a good point yeah like i don't
03:33:06 know the history of that but you could be right he i mean he uh well it's hard to like put dates on
03:33:11 this without looking into it but like you know he was running that channel for a long time and i
03:33:16 always just thought of it as like a guy who makes really informative videos and then i listen to
03:33:21 hello internet and he's a fascinating character like he has a really interesting personality
03:33:25 and i love him and it's him and uh and brady from numberphile and they have great chemistry
03:33:30 and it's a good podcast it's the first podcast i ever really listened to actually yeah never was
03:33:34 never big in a podcast until recently i'm getting big in a podcast now too yeah and now and that's
03:33:39 that's a thing like the pcp kind of came about like none of us were into podcasts yeah like when
03:33:45 the pcp came about that's not that's not i have way more that's not true i was not gonna lie i have
03:33:49 way more fun doing pcp i was then i do making my videos i was hugely into this is the most fun
03:33:55 i've had making anything like in the last like three months i was i was hugely into the ricky
03:33:59 jervais show which is um which is based on the ricky jervais podcast so that was like i was actually
03:34:05 a huge influence on t-bap and like the way that the t-bap was presented t-bap is pretty podcast
03:34:10 pretty much a podcast yeah yeah like the true it always was in the in like the later episodes the
03:34:14 reason i drew them sitting at a table is because that's how they are in the ricky jervais really
03:34:18 even i didn't know that i i well i feel like i definitely mentioned okay maybe i just forgot
03:34:23 yeah fair enough i mean like back when me and tom and jessie first started talking we were all
03:34:30 like pretty harsh on the idea of like podcasts and unedited content like we all thought it was
03:34:36 total bullshit and that like no one would care about it and like like when fucking poor neil x
03:34:42 who like at the time that he made elements of brony like we all thought this will never take
03:34:47 off unless it's a super highly edited thing because they're so long yeah and so we put so
03:34:51 much if that came out now it could just be like and i told him this over time like you
03:34:58 should like like like once it got to the point where like this is now what kind of contents
03:35:03 popular on youtube and in his series was just the visionary i've told him a bunch of times like
03:35:08 dude just put out parts five and six as podcasts because in the current state of youtube it will
03:35:12 be exactly as accessible it might be more successful because then you can just put that on behind
03:35:18 something else yeah as opposed to having to look at it for two fucking hours yeah and like
03:35:23 it's such a shame but like we were all super anti-podcast until like literally up until
03:35:29 we started like um like biggest problem in the universe convinced me and jessie like oh my god
03:35:37 podcasts are cool i could have fucking escaped that last life if i'd remember that i had fucking
03:35:41 past wall i always forget about past wall the best spell in the universe it just it just
03:35:47 sends you through a wall and nothing can fucking fall you did they fail the one time you tried to
03:35:52 use it well it failed because i use it in the it's because i use it on the wrong spot you can only
03:35:56 go through like the wall the wall can't extend into infinity yeah okay like you can only move
03:36:01 through relatively thin move through one square essentially uh so there's some there's some limit
03:36:07 forget how it's determined anyway seems like something you might want to figure out anyway yeah
03:36:11 we were all like oh no we were all pretty i mean even before that like we were fairly anti let's play
03:36:18 until we got into game grumps and then we were fairly anti-podcast and then we got anti let's play
03:36:22 again i'm still trying to do it i never i'm doing a let's play right now oh no ben's doing a let's
03:36:27 you know what i guess i guess that's technically true it feels more like a podcast if i was playing
03:36:31 the game i'd be really mad that's that's why we got like because the re like i had this perception
03:36:36 that let's play meant like you know something shit yeah until i found actually you know it wasn't
03:36:43 okay i was into game grumps for a long time but what got me into the idea of doing let's plays
03:36:47 and podcasts was uh yacht sees one uh let's try it out oh yes and like just like realizing that you
03:36:54 could just have a video game just be there while you just talked about whatever it was like oh
03:36:59 this can be a let's play or podcast i guess i guess that's and that's where digi bros came from
03:37:04 you know maybe i'm still just in like 2010 i mean have you ever watched digi bros it's just a podcast
03:37:11 we don't even talk about the game i never watched digi bros never really i don't think i well maybe
03:37:16 i watched like one or two but i i just my stigma for let's plays runs deep a lot of people's does and
03:37:22 i think that's the only reason that channel's never gotten bigger because it's it we were talking
03:37:26 about this on a lot of you changed the name to something that said it was just like this really
03:37:29 doesn't have anything to do with let's plays well i've been meaning to like we've been talking a lot
03:37:33 about this because for the longest time we were putting no effort into it deliberately because
03:37:37 it was just for fun but like it started to really baffle me that for money well like digi bros was
03:37:44 started before i had like before after dark became a vlogging channel that's posting all the time
03:37:49 right and then it slowly became really weird to me that like my vlogging channel has like people
03:37:55 who watch all these fucking videos like they'll get like 10 000 views per video you know and it
03:38:00 could be the most inane weird random shit and yet the digi bros channel which is the same content
03:38:07 just with a video game overlaid which to my mind makes it better there's something to watch other
03:38:12 than me half shaded in darkness gets no views and i'm like the only reason this is is that people
03:38:18 think it's a let's play yeah it's really not it's just a podcast it's no different from the pcp
03:38:24 or my vlogs when i think let's play i think some really obnoxious motherfuckers screaming at a game
03:38:29 right yeah even though you know it's me and i would maybe you're sitting at the game maybe you
03:38:34 finally sold out it's always victor who plays the games well that makes it better off this right
03:38:39 off the bat um i am incompetent at video games so it would be unwatchable if i play victor's
03:38:46 barely competent but at least he can play and talk at the same time and i can't uh i can't do that
03:38:52 either but yeah i can never stream streaming is something i'm gonna be able to do but yeah it's
03:38:58 really funny to me how like how we can go through these phases of like thinking it's thinking podcasting
03:39:04 is totally lame until any of us heard one podcast that we liked and immediately wanted to do that
03:39:08 seems weird but it doesn't seem weird at all like if you see nothing but shit about a format it's like
03:39:12 oh this format shit and they seem to go it's like oh it can be that i felt like what i felt that way
03:39:17 about vlogs until uh until i start nice dad or something no um max landis a plus three oh yeah
03:39:24 these vlogs yeah those are pretty great yeah and like what inspired me to start doing all the vlogs
03:39:29 in digital after dark was how shit max landis's quality is so shit and yet decent quality i would
03:39:35 be watched like like like my what do you mean so shit me a decent quality well like he feels like
03:39:39 a laptop yeah like the actual quality of the microphone audio and video is more respect than
03:39:45 that he writes movies he doesn't you know make doesn't he care about the fucking cinema well
03:39:51 that's the point it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that's the whole point here well yeah that's
03:39:54 the thing like i for the longest time my policy has always been i won't make a video i wouldn't
03:39:58 watch and then like i always thought i won't watch stuff with shit video and audio quality
03:40:04 but i start following max landis and he has videos where it's like he's you know traveling
03:40:09 and he's like in a hotel room and he just like clearly whipped open a laptop and hit record and
03:40:14 started talking into like the shittiest camera ever but what he's saying is interesting so i was
03:40:21 watching these and i started watching and i'm like wait i'm willing to watch this i could make this
03:40:26 like in 10 seconds i could flip on my phone and have better image and audio quality there's a lot
03:40:31 of videos that ideas have that fall through the cracks so i'm just like i'm not willing to just do
03:40:35 this yeah and well i bought a gorilla pod buddy so that's how you do that no no no what happened
03:40:42 i had a fucking ring of wizardry from the first room and i fucking died well man well that
03:40:49 you're a wizard i would have made all the fucking difference that's so good to get early because
03:40:55 suddenly you don't have you barely even have to level up before you can cast your dang spells
03:40:59 just cast them right off the bat because it's fucking your aptitudes through the roof
03:41:03 incidentally here's here's my advice on how to get into lower quality content how to get into it okay
03:41:07 how to get into making like like lower quality making that's real i'm always looking to make
03:41:12 low quality content did you tell me more how to get yourself low production value how to get
03:41:17 yourself mentally into the idea of making lower quality content all right is to belt out a ton of
03:41:23 it all at once like what got me like what i did do that one time and it was great what launched the
03:41:29 digi bro after dark vlogging like thing like this this happened just all at once because you know
03:41:36 we're talking about this channel's been around for years yeah it's been around for like three years
03:41:40 and it's uploads at like maybe once a month maybe twice a month sometimes a vlog sometimes a podcast
03:41:46 like whatever was like something that didn't have a place right in one day i put out three vlogs
03:41:53 like like filmed back to back and just released them as soon as they were done and then it was just
03:41:58 like this is now a channel where this can happen and therefore and like i didn't stop all week i put
03:42:03 out a video every day or two videos a day all week and people were like digi's lost his fucking mind
03:42:08 what's happening but but then also people were like this is epic this needs to be my life now
03:42:13 and i was like this will be your life and then i didn't stop for six months and this is where we are
03:42:19 now um yep yep the three videos i did that day the first one was called losing my mind in a room
03:42:26 full of naked anime girls and it was it was just about how when i look at these posters all i see
03:42:31 is their flaws because i look at them so often that all i can see is like how shit the art is
03:42:36 in almost all of these and i'm just like running around my room with a camera pointing at posters
03:42:40 and going look at how her neck does this thing it's so fucking weird i hate it look at this one
03:42:45 her crotch is in the wrong place and i'm just like going around screaming at the camera
03:42:49 losing my mind literally and uh and that started it all and now it seems like such a fitting way
03:42:55 of thinking it looks like we are now it was beautiful
03:43:02 there's a lot of a lot of my vlogs i should be running around my room pointing at posters
03:43:06 and those are my favorite ones we should all just resolve to just make shit i have been meaning
03:43:12 i have been meaning to make more of the of the you know those two like essay videos i did i just
03:43:18 i just don't fucking i just it's just thinking of those are really good you should definitely make
03:43:23 more of that i do i like them it's just thinking of like what do i want to talk about i just want
03:43:28 i want my video comment i would recommend just just effort as possible try to consume the media
03:43:33 that you want to make videos about in general i guess i think it'll just ideas will just come
03:43:38 another way to get yourself into the mindset of like making worse content is just think about
03:43:43 how much of it you like like for me it was that maxland is thing but we are all no fans of the
03:43:48 gibbon take channel sure which is just random bullshit like weird fucking esoteric ideas that
03:43:55 just spawn out of the ether and i enjoy that channel no no no the only thing about those it's
03:44:00 not that i have anything against the idea of putting out low low quality low effort content
03:44:05 it's just that i don't i don't have ideas for like things i actually want to talk about fair well
03:44:09 that's there's a difference between you and nate i think nate is just a verse to the idea of making
03:44:14 something he's a paragon that has no like i've thought about it and i i can't do you do it on
03:44:24 fucking bestie boy bestie boy you fucking do it right so what are you talking about that's fine
03:44:28 the point is that it's not bad content you're thinking of it wrong like would any of us accuse
03:44:33 jump cut jack of being a bad video i love jump cut jack it's an amazing video and it probably took
03:44:39 15 minutes to make probably like i haven't seen jump cut jack why it's like it's like 30 seconds long
03:44:45 and it's wonderful four mags in size hey guys welcome to another fucking video yeah that's it
03:44:51 it's that's it that's it just given saying hey guys welcome to another fucking video but it's
03:44:56 through constant like every letter is him in a different position in the room it's magical he
03:45:01 just turned on a camera and stood in like he stood in somewhere in the room and said the whole
03:45:05 line then stood somewhere else and said the whole line and then he just edited together so that he's
03:45:09 teleporting everywhere constantly while saying this one look look i thought about 15 minutes
03:45:14 give me such a low key genius i can't i'm trying to fix my problem and i've already got it starting
03:45:19 got it started while i was making the lucifer one i had another one that was being edited by this
03:45:24 other guy that's like a similar scope to the one punch man one which only took a long time to get
03:45:30 done because the editor guys are fucking incompetent piece of shit that is the problem when you
03:45:34 upload the videos yeah outsourced is no fuck you buddy you piece of shit i hit two rings you gotta
03:45:43 find yourself a divu i i do we all need a divu this guy is not my divu the key to do to having a
03:45:48 divu is to have somebody who's just so in love with your content that they would they would die for
03:45:55 i get people who tell me that they love it and some of them are content creators the problem is
03:45:59 you need to find someone who's actually good this is fucking the guy i work with is good but he's a
03:46:04 little bit unreliable and he's got other things going on that's a cardinal sin it's a cardinal sin
03:46:09 yeah when is the divu collective actually gonna be a collective so we all get one yeah that'd be
03:46:17 nice that's an important question it's such a shame divu does not like that meme and doesn't
03:46:23 understand why it's great it's hilarious wait it seems pretty innocuous it's just
03:46:31 i thought that was his idea no jesse came up with it oh what like there was one episode he needs to
03:46:37 embrace it there was one podcast where jesse and divu got into an argument about something yeah and
03:46:43 jesse felt that he had been steamrolled in his argument so he edited in segments into the video
03:46:48 where he argues with a straw man of divu that is the divu collective just trying to assimilate him
03:46:55 and change his opinions to match its own and it was fucking hilarious it was amazing and we all
03:47:01 like everyone immediately wanted it to be a meme and like divu was like you know i'm not he was like
03:47:06 he said uh he was like i i don't get it and i don't think it's funny and like i don't care for it
03:47:12 but i'm not gonna stop it because like you know you can't control these things yeah like it's just
03:47:18 what you're it's a thing revolving around me now i think he just doesn't like the association he has
03:47:22 with someone he didn't even like at the time the fact that jesse kind of like went behind his back
03:47:28 and edited in like an argument but like it well yeah we should just strike back he should he should
03:47:34 strike back in a new in a new video or so in the next pc page he should argue with jesse about
03:47:38 something right he should just become the divu collective they already have our own horrible
03:47:43 jesse meme he doesn't approve that's true that's true we all we all need to we all need to drive
03:47:49 a stave through jesse's heart in some way only then we hate us all equally you know you know about
03:47:55 his revenge plan have you heard about that i did hear about that yeah that he has like a really
03:48:00 elaborate like he as he put it because he was like this isn't because someone was like why don't
03:48:06 you just like explain it to someone he's like it's not like that he's like it's not like a video
03:48:10 revenge plan it's like something i would have to actually spend like years staging like this is
03:48:16 like a really elaborate like a film like like a movie idea plan for all we know boozy floozy is step
03:48:22 one of this plan it's very possible well he said he said that he had relented for now that these
03:48:28 plans should never see the light isn't that exactly what he would say if he was trying to get us you
03:48:33 i don't i don't know if i can it won't work we're gonna betray him tomorrow i'm ready to betray
03:48:38 anyone at a moment so when jesse's video steps into the ring we're all dead
03:48:50 speaking of when should we wrap this up i don't know i guess i don't think i can i don't think i
03:48:55 can play anymore in this fucking game all right well we've got four hours recorded i don't have a
03:49:00 lot of space left i don't think we have enough i don't think it's enough and we should all go to
03:49:04 sleep so we can actually make sure there are things to be done tomorrow it's true i'm kind of awake
03:49:10 now though that's okay i hope you all enjoyed the ultimate procrastinator's decompression chamber
03:49:15 yeah it was uh it was a doozy this has been your host ben saint and my friends who are the other guys
