00:00:00 Hello and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm the best
00:00:25 guy ever and I'm here with Jesse Wood. I am the punisher, I'm not me anymore. I knew
00:00:32 identity as the punisher. You're a punisher of ears and eyes, Hippocrit. Go on, Gibb. Are
00:00:43 you calling me ugly and also has a dumb voice? Yeah, that's correct. Gibb. I'm Hippocrit.
00:00:51 I'm going to put in twice as much effort today. You're going to be the first villain
00:00:57 I fucking punish. Good. And we're happy to have back with us. Perhaps the most qualified
00:01:04 of us, given his channel RebelPixels on this particular topic, Tommy Oliver. Because Gibbin's
00:01:10 putting in twice as much effort, I'm only going to put in half to balance it out. That
00:01:14 math checks out. That math checks out. Okay. So yeah, today's topic is effort. Putting
00:01:22 in effort, working hard at shit. Wait a minute, are you implying that I'm four times as worse
00:01:28 as you? He's, wait. That's the math. No, it's wrong. To balance it out. All right, before
00:01:34 we get into that, I want to say that the inspiration for this. I'm offended, I'm so angry. We watched
00:01:40 this video of this guy. I don't know how old he is. I think he's a high schooler. And
00:01:46 he has, in the video, it's him with all these Game Boy SPs lined up in a row. Game Boy Advance
00:01:51 SPs. And he's been grinding out, trying to catch a shiny ponytail. I think like in a
00:01:57 live stream for around six months, I think it took him. And in the video, he finally gets
00:02:02 it and he flips his shit. He goes absolutely ballistic. And it seems like perhaps the greatest
00:02:09 one is light. And he becomes the punisher. Yeah, his response. And so, but the thing
00:02:14 about it is, the thing about it is the comments are absolutely flooded with people saying
00:02:18 like, wow, what a fucking loser. What a piece of shit. This is how you spend your time.
00:02:23 This is what you want to do. And so just as a result of seeing these comments, we felt
00:02:30 inspired to comment on this phenomenon. So I'll just say right now that this man, doing
00:02:37 what he did, this man set himself a goal, right? He arranged everything he needed to
00:02:41 do. He got it. He got it going. He started the engine and he grinded it out every single
00:02:47 day doing this. And this isn't like, this isn't like doing something new all the time.
00:02:51 He did the same thing over and over again to achieve this very specific goal of catching
00:02:56 a shiny ponytail. And he fucking did it. He accomplished his goal. And these commenters,
00:03:01 man, these commenters have, I mean, admittedly, obviously they've never achieved anything
00:03:04 hard in their entire lives and never worked for something. They've never reached a pinnacle
00:03:08 of experience as a result of months and months of work on something. But if they had, they
00:03:13 would know that it's not about the value, the objective value, whatever the fuck that
00:03:18 means or whatever goal you're trying to reach. It's about personal satisfaction. And this
00:03:22 guy achieved the goal he was trying to reach. And he, as a result, was the happiest man
00:03:27 in the world for, you know, however long that lasted. And fuck everyone who doesn't disagree.
00:03:34 You people are just jealous that you don't have a shiny ponytail. Go fucking kill yourselves,
00:03:37 you pieces of shit. And that's what I have to say about it.
00:03:39 Yeah, he was, he was a role model.
00:03:40 Well, you know what? I have a shiny Mew and I got it for free at a Nintendo event. So
00:03:44 fuck that kid.
00:03:45 Cause I'm better at the game than him and I didn't have to put in any effort at all.
00:03:48 I bet you were just as excited when you got that as when he got his shiny ponytail.
00:03:53 I was and still am. I still have my shiny Mew.
00:03:55 In fact, it was better that way because you, you were just so happy. You didn't have to
00:04:00 put in all the time like this guy did.
00:04:01 Exactly. The true, the true joys in this life are the things you didn't have to work
00:04:05 for.
00:04:06 As Ben would say, the only way to win is not to play.
00:04:09 As Ben would say, the only way to win is to take you on Dutch Ones.
00:04:12 It is a good idea.
00:04:14 So what's that give? Sorry.
00:04:16 The whole point of the putting in effort for something that's completely pointless for
00:04:21 the rest of like, like compared to everyone else and everything else in your life. If
00:04:25 it's pointless, but you still like it, is it worth doing all that stuff?
00:04:30 And I would say for that, for that Pokemon thing, I mean, you didn't seem very old.
00:04:34 So he didn't, he probably didn't have a lot of responsibility.
00:04:37 So I would say probably like 16 or 17 or something.
00:04:39 I would say that was a good idea because he can say, I got it.
00:04:43 Look at how cool.
00:04:44 I mean, honestly, how many other people his age are willing to dedicate that amount of
00:04:47 time to something, you know?
00:04:48 And I know he was like streaming.
00:04:50 So he's got like a community going on.
00:04:52 Obviously he's probably pretty into Pokemon in general.
00:04:55 But like, it's just impressive no matter what they want to do.
00:04:59 Like the guy who wanted to like eat a freight train and like did it.
00:05:02 It took him like 20 years or something and he's like digested every piece of it.
00:05:06 I don't know if that's real, but something like that.
00:05:08 It's like, wow, why would you do that?
00:05:09 That's probably actually causing you physical harm.
00:05:11 But he had a goal.
00:05:12 And I mean, all right, this is really what it comes down to for me.
00:05:15 Our lives are completely meaningless.
00:05:18 Nothing has any point whatsoever.
00:05:20 So everything we do is an arbitrary, you know, it's all arbitrary.
00:05:25 Any goal you set for yourself.
00:05:27 If you want to, if you, let's, like the people who are going to be like, lol, he just spends
00:05:30 every night playing Pokemon, why don't you go get laid, bro?
00:05:33 Why don't you go smash some puss dog, homie, my nigga.
00:05:37 You know, they talk like this because I'm a racist.
00:05:39 You know, that's a very offensive impression of me.
00:05:43 Yeah.
00:05:44 It's, what, what are they getting out of that?
00:05:46 You know?
00:05:47 God, it makes me so, I want to strangle every person who fucking says this shit because
00:05:53 this guy just decided he was going to do something and he followed through with it.
00:05:57 And you know what?
00:05:58 You know what?
00:05:59 That ability to follow through on something is much more of a valuable skill than any arbitrary
00:06:05 ass thing you decide to set it to.
00:06:06 If you can achieve something that's like takes months to do, you can do anything you want.
00:06:11 This gets a better person than any fucking commenter.
00:06:13 Exactly.
00:06:14 And that leads right into why I don't respect commenters and why I want to tell them personally
00:06:20 for the 100th time how much they sicken me and I want them all to commit suicide.
00:06:26 That would be ideal.
00:06:27 I fucking, leaving a YouTube comment takes no effort and that's why they're all cancer.
00:06:35 Yeah, really, that's the, that's the, that's like the secondary point here.
00:06:38 How much it is great to do things that take effort, but how little, if not a negative
00:06:43 impact you have on the world by doing things that take no effort.
00:06:45 I think Jabroni can sit down on the computer and you know, watching your video through
00:06:51 a glass-eyed fog of retardation and fucking slam their ape-like fists onto the keyboard
00:06:56 and, and hash out some ignorance, spew it in your direction.
00:07:01 Any monkey could do that.
00:07:02 In fact, I, I believe that most of them are monkeys or at least monkey-like, simian people.
00:07:07 Some kind of mutant hybrid created in, in the island of Dr. Giro or whatever the fuck
00:07:13 the animal guy was called.
00:07:14 Dr. Giro, a different guy.
00:07:15 Dr. Seuss.
00:07:16 Dr. Seuss.
00:07:17 Dr. Seuss, yes.
00:07:18 But, but if you fucking, if you watch a video on the internet and you disagree with it,
00:07:24 or even if you do agree with it, if you want to say anything at all pertaining to anything,
00:07:28 put in the effort, write something down, memorize something, fucking learn how to speak in public
00:07:33 or fucking turn out a camera and learn to dress nice, fucking comb your hair, stop being
00:07:37 a fat slob, all of you people, you're dumb and I don't like you and I don't like you
00:07:43 Tom, what do you make of all this?
00:07:46 I mean, I think, like you said, it's, it's that, you know, there is no purpose in life.
00:07:52 People ask, like, what's the purpose of living or like, why do we exist or whatever?
00:07:56 And like, the really liberating thing is that there is no point.
00:07:58 Like we're all just like some genetic accident and we're just happened to be here.
00:08:03 We're all going to die.
00:08:04 We're all going to rot.
00:08:05 So that means that the point of life is whatever you want it to be.
00:08:07 Well, except Jesse, obviously, but for the rest of us, yeah.
00:08:10 Right.
00:08:11 It's kind of why I'm like very jealous of obsessively, like heavily autistic obsessive
00:08:18 people who have like a big thing that they really love and they do it all the time and
00:08:23 makes them super happy, you know, even though they won't be able to get a job or anything.
00:08:27 It's, they're having fun.
00:08:28 I'm legitimately jealous.
00:08:30 My mother was a special ed teacher and so I met a fair amount of these people, but I'm
00:08:35 pretty jealous of just, you know, fairly retarded people because I mean, I'm not, I'm not trying
00:08:40 to shit on anybody.
00:08:41 I'm just saying that like, if what is important to you in life is, you know, getting your
00:08:45 mac and cheese for dinner every day and you get it and you're over the fucking moon because
00:08:50 you got it while you're watching, you know, whatever shows you like to watch on TV.
00:08:53 And that's, that's the limit of, of what your understanding of happiness is and you're
00:08:57 at a hundred every night because you get it.
00:09:00 That's, that's literally the ideal way to live.
00:09:02 So we should all be retarded is what you're saying.
00:09:04 Yeah.
00:09:05 We really should be retarded.
00:09:06 The only reason I'm at all interested in, in, excuse me, having any higher level of
00:09:11 intelligence than, than, uh, putting so much effort into, that's my effort right there.
00:09:17 The only reason I'm at all interested in putting any higher level of, of thought into any of
00:09:20 this is in the vain hope that perhaps humanity will one day rise above our, our bestial place
00:09:27 in the universe right now, maybe we'll become, you know, God's made of pure energy and our
00:09:32 existence will have some impact.
00:09:33 But frankly, like the universe.
00:09:34 If I'm going to become a God made of pure energy, I'm still, I'm still going to have
00:09:38 a stamp collection if I'm a God made of pure energy because I'm going to get bored otherwise.
00:09:43 If that, if you rule the universe, I mean, yeah, if that happens, it's going to happen
00:09:48 like millions of years after we're dead.
00:09:50 Right.
00:09:51 And personally, I believe that if I'm going to die, then I want humanity to go extinct
00:09:55 right after.
00:09:56 I don't want humanity to achieve without me.
00:09:58 I don't want them to continue because you're taking the, the cuja from Final Fantasy nine
00:10:01 route.
00:10:02 Yeah, exactly.
00:10:04 That's the best route.
00:10:06 He didn't have the right fashion ideas, but you know, his whole nihilism, his belief structure,
00:10:12 his desire to end all life.
00:10:15 You know, I can respect that.
00:10:16 He is not deserving of continuing without me.
00:10:19 You know, that's why Kuj is a great villain because, you know, he just, it's a totally
00:10:23 understandable thing that he did.
00:10:25 He thought he was going to live forever.
00:10:27 But then when he found out he wasn't, he's like, oh, shit, this changes everything.
00:10:30 And as a result, he's like, well, if I'm going to die, so does everything else need
00:10:33 to.
00:10:34 Yeah.
00:10:35 You know, Final Fantasy nine is, you know, can this be a Final Fantasy podcast?
00:10:37 Absolutely.
00:10:38 Whatever the crappy fucking topicals.
00:10:40 Kuj was willing to put in the work to blow up everything.
00:10:44 That's a guy you can respect, you know.
00:10:46 He went straight from zero to a hundred like that.
00:10:49 And that's, that's the kind of guy I want to destroy my world.
00:10:52 Hmm.
00:10:53 But you know, I mean.
00:10:54 You could destroy my box.
00:10:55 Yeah.
00:10:56 That's what I want.
00:10:58 We can, we all know this stuff.
00:11:00 We have something of a basis to talk about this from, because we're all creators and
00:11:04 we all do make shit that, you know, could mayor, that we throw into the void to hopefully
00:11:10 be valued, but easily could not be, despite putting tons of effort into it.
00:11:15 Right now, as I've talked about many times, working on a video, I've been working on four
00:11:19 months and months and months and just, just today in fact, and yesterday, I found two videos
00:11:25 that have come out.
00:11:26 Okay.
00:11:27 I wrote this video, but it's about Undertale spoilers.
00:11:30 The game that shall not be named.
00:11:31 I wrote it back in October, right, like a month after the game came out and it was ready.
00:11:35 I just needed to edit it.
00:11:37 Shit comes up and I'm still working, been working on it the whole time.
00:11:40 And in the meantime, I have seen not one, but two videos that cover all the exact same
00:11:44 points, rendering intellectually rendering my effort completely useless.
00:11:49 There's no intellectual benefit.
00:11:50 I could just, you know, make a video that points to these and that would be just as
00:11:54 valuable to the collective consciousness as the thing that I'm currently working on.
00:11:58 Maybe my production values are better, but it doesn't matter.
00:12:00 But the point is, I'm not going to stop because, well, I guess it's, it's because I care about
00:12:06 myself and making the thing I'm making more than I do about the intellectual content of
00:12:11 it, I guess.
00:12:12 So actually maybe I'm doing the wrong thing.
00:12:14 Maybe I should just stop and kill myself.
00:12:16 Never mind.
00:12:17 No.
00:12:18 No.
00:12:19 You should make it.
00:12:20 Well, that's the whole thing.
00:12:21 Is that like you can't, you can't care.
00:12:22 It gets like the trap of YouTube and the internet and like this whole connected culture in general
00:12:27 is that like because everything can be like quantified and measured and like reach can
00:12:31 be like easily keeping track of now and like popularity and things like that, you know,
00:12:36 it's so easy to like get downtrodden and get distracted by the fact that like you have
00:12:40 X amount of reach when you want Y amount of reach.
00:12:43 Yeah.
00:12:44 Yeah.
00:12:45 And that's really annoying, especially I think it's gotten even worse kind of now that
00:12:48 we have Patreon because now like not only do you get like popularity measurement, you
00:12:51 have like monetary measurements as well.
00:12:53 That's true.
00:12:54 It's like everything about like someone's creativity now can be quantified in like real
00:12:59 world terms that like matter.
00:13:02 And so all of a sudden the thing you're doing for passion now has a lot of real world implications.
00:13:08 And if you want to chase that obviously, because like this is the thing you enjoy is what you
00:13:11 want to do with your life, but now it becomes a job and it becomes a competition because
00:13:16 you know, it's like a free market.
00:13:18 So you have to like make yourself marketable and you have to do all that shit.
00:13:21 And so all of a sudden you're kind of passions being poisoned by like the rest of life.
00:13:26 Yeah, totally.
00:13:27 So it's like you have to kind of disconnect yourself from that, which is super difficult
00:13:31 because like you want to keep consuming more content because there's so much at your fingertips
00:13:35 that you can like be inspired by and things like that.
00:13:37 But at the same time, it's almost like disheartening to see someone do something so much better
00:13:41 or have so much more success, especially when they're worse than you and they have more
00:13:44 success and you don't understand like what the secret sauce is there.
00:13:48 Both of these videos that cover what I have covered.
00:13:51 Each one, one has 115,000 views.
00:13:53 The other has 250,000 views.
00:13:56 I'm just curious to see how much mine will climb to when I finish it.
00:13:59 Man, I gotta, yeah, I gotta talk about that because that's a topic that's near and dear
00:14:02 to my heart.
00:14:03 It's more successful channels than you that are also way crappier than you who then release
00:14:10 a crappier version of a video that you were planning to make or that you have made.
00:14:14 Oh, and you've seen tons of that, especially in the pony days.
00:14:16 Oh yeah.
00:14:17 Anthony C. has been ripping me off for his entire fucking career and I'll go ahead and
00:14:23 say that on record right now.
00:14:26 Everything he's ever said in his videos is a crappier version of something I said in
00:14:29 my videos.
00:14:30 There you go.
00:14:31 But also, you know, lacking the self-awareness and the comedic timing and the intellectualism
00:14:37 and the wit.
00:14:38 Mm-hmm.
00:14:39 Right.
00:14:40 But I digress.
00:14:42 Uh, what the fuck was I saying?
00:14:44 I don't remember.
00:14:45 Well, if you're talking about shittier people making more popular things.
00:14:50 Okay, yeah.
00:14:51 Forget Anthony C. I was gonna bring this around to a guy that I really hate, which is a YouTuber
00:14:54 by the name of Nerdwriter, but I'm pretty sure we all hate.
00:14:58 I just found out who Nerdwriter was like two days ago because you kept bitching about him
00:15:02 on Twitter and I had to look him up.
00:15:03 I don't think I'd say I hate him, but there are some major grievances that I'm sure you'll
00:15:07 go into.
00:15:08 Yeah.
00:15:09 He's my favorite.
00:15:10 He's my favorite.
00:15:12 Uh, I didn't see it.
00:15:14 Donnie, get out of here.
00:15:17 Donnie possessed Gibbon.
00:15:18 That wasn't really him.
00:15:20 He's like a evil spirit that consumes this all.
00:15:23 Yeah.
00:15:24 So, one of my favorite cartoons of all time is Hey Arnold.
00:15:28 And I've been wanting to make a video about it forever.
00:15:31 And where'd everyone go?
00:15:33 Is this the-
00:15:34 We're here.
00:15:35 Did I break it up?
00:15:36 No, we're all single quiet.
00:15:37 Be quiet.
00:15:38 Waiting with aided breath for your words of farting and making noises. Anyways, my point is
00:15:49 Putting in the effort
00:15:52 No, I wrote a hey Arnold video like fucking months ago like five months. Yes shit and I saw in nerd writers comments
00:16:00 Some some fucking Jbrown in his comments was like hey nerd writer since you're the smartest fucking the best
00:16:08 guy of all time on
00:16:10 YouTube you should make a video about hey Arnold and he just responded to it and like okay
00:16:16 I will and and the fucking the clouds parted
00:16:19 Millions of thumbs up and people are losing their fucking minds. Yes nerd writer is finally gonna show the world about hey
00:16:25 Arnold, that's my fucking job
00:16:27 I'll do it better. I'll do it better than you can and he's gonna come out with some asinine shitty
00:16:33 Modeling manipulative fucking video about
00:16:38 If you look into it from the right perspective, you'll see that hey Arnold is about us
00:16:56 He's gonna ruin he's gonna ruin hey Arnold for all time is gonna ruin it for me
00:16:59 He's gonna try to take it from me just like everyone ever from of all time is stolen every idea
00:17:04 I've ever had and I've gotten no credit for it. Yeah, it's like that's the whole point right like we're talking about like putting
00:17:09 In the effort and stuff like and now we're just shitting on nerd writer
00:17:13 But like it does objectively massive amounts of work on most of his videos. He really does put in the
00:17:19 What are we talking about right now? I supposed to be talking about
00:17:22 I was gonna talk about
00:17:27 He's putting in the effort on hating nerd writer. We'll put yeah, that's true
00:17:30 Yeah, I am putting in the work for that. I think it's got a real point though
00:17:36 I was gonna say about the way my channel has been
00:17:40 Like I've I've thought about the way I make videos because my last video a few days ago the puzzle pirates thing
00:17:47 Hmm
00:17:48 Nobody is putting in effort for like making your channel big and grow and get all the stuff and doing doing the things
00:17:56 Nobody cares or knows about puzzle pirates and I've got like a few videos planned that I like very specifically for me
00:18:03 Like nobody would really get them unless they were very like like very similar
00:18:08 upbringings and stuff
00:18:10 So I'm not really like going
00:18:13 Putting in the effort to make it like a like a youtuber if you know what I mean
00:18:18 Yeah, it's just I just like and it's helping me like like if you were a youtuber
00:18:22 You'd be doing a review of the division right now or something like that or undertale
00:18:26 Yeah, I would be doing something that would get me views and I just it's not really making me
00:18:33 Motivate because I for a long time
00:18:34 I was thinking I got to do ratchet and clank 2 next because I want to talk about that and and the first one and people
00:18:41 Asking for it, and I just couldn't think of anything at the time
00:18:44 So yeah, yeah, it's it's it's better for me to just think of my channel as a hobby for the moment
00:18:49 And then I'll put in the effort
00:18:51 In into making it cool for me and then later it will it's not like it's just I'm just saying like you can put in effort to
00:18:59 To you can lack effort and it could still be good because if I was trying really hard to make videos to get big
00:19:06 I would not be making anything because I'd be like right because there's this there's definitely a
00:19:12 sense of like
00:19:13 Paralysis when you're when you're like oh god like eight you can say it on h3h you three's vlogs lately
00:19:18 They're like man like like h3h 3h 3h 3 has just reached like a million subscribers not long ago
00:19:24 And like now they've got their other channel because they're like too scared to make anything to put on their main channel because they're afraid
00:19:29 It won't be good enough. Yeah, it's like, you know, it's it's like that
00:19:33 Yeah
00:19:34 But do you think it's a serious problem and that's why I put in the effort to have multiple channels
00:19:40 because
00:19:41 The fact that I have a channel like my Japanese anime is or a channel like the blue glow or man child think you know
00:19:46 Those channels all have strong gimmicks and strong themes. Yeah, and a strong kind of content
00:19:50 Which frees up my main channel and the stress and allows me on that channel to just not give a fuck at all and post
00:19:58 Whatever inane insane crap that I want
00:20:01 That's true, you know, I was just talking to a to a to a guy
00:20:04 I know about how the interesting thing about your your channel set up your your multiple channel set up is that
00:20:12 Your the fact that you've got multiple channels with different identities is is part of the narrative basically
00:20:19 Yeah, and but it's just that that narrative isn't really the one most suited to succeeding on YouTube. Oh, yeah, and it's yeah, you know
00:20:27 Someone just messaged me
00:20:28 I never mind just you just make your own website. That's that guy with the glasses, but just I was gonna do that
00:20:33 I was different. That's smart. Yeah, I was I was I was going to
00:20:38 When Johnny with the channels
00:20:42 Yeah
00:20:43 Yeah, when Johnny old school decided that he wasn't gonna be Johnny old school anymore
00:20:47 He said I'll just give you my site and you can change it to your site
00:20:50 Oh blue, but it was like I would have had to buy a domain name
00:20:55 I would have had to yeah put an effort to make the fucking thing to make the website
00:21:00 So you got to put in the effort
00:21:04 I don't want
00:21:07 Smart you got to play smart not hard. Here's a question about effort. Do you think that effort is
00:21:12 Affected by passion because I would say absolutely
00:21:16 because
00:21:17 Any any video that I'm making
00:21:20 For the purpose of like well, I got to make this video
00:21:23 It's never gonna get fucking made. Yeah, but when I get distracted by some other totally stupid idea
00:21:30 Those videos like 90% of my videos that I've actually made are videos that are like distractions that I did to get away from an actual video
00:21:39 Yeah, that is the entirety of my give-and-take channel, right?
00:21:42 I was gonna say bring it back to what you were just saying is that like you're not some of you're putting an effort
00:21:45 You're not putting an effort you are it's just you're putting effort into things like
00:21:49 You can go with like passion or marketing, you know, like yeah, like the two kind of extremes
00:21:53 I can be like whore yourself out and talk about what people want to hear or you can put an effort to like be very authentic
00:21:59 And I don't know about you guys
00:22:01 I've said this many times before but I
00:22:04 Greatly respect anyone who would even put in the work required to run a YouTube channel
00:22:09 Even if you make shit at least you're doing something, you know, and and that's I mean at the very least that's better than your average commenter
00:22:16 Even if they're you know terrible videos at least this guy's show got something to show for and and creative people when they do that when they get
00:22:24 Distracted with other like, you know sillier or more personal projects in between the actual work
00:22:29 You'll trick yourself into thinking that you're doing a shitty job or not doing enough work
00:22:35 When really you're doing a shitload of work and you're making great shit
00:22:38 It's just not what you think you should be doing so you don't count it for yourself in your head and you make yourself
00:22:43 Like yeah, the last three videos that I posted were all like asinine crap
00:22:48 That just like came to me like that and I like made like you know ten minutes or whatever
00:22:52 I'm fucking crows video or the file which video or the and they all ruled incident everybody fucking loves those videos
00:22:58 They all have like massive thumbs up. Yeah, everybody's like yes, you're making good content again
00:23:03 And it's like well, I wanted to be making shitty content, but that's a lot of work
00:23:07 So I guess I'll have to settle for making good videos
00:23:10 Yeah, it's it's it's tough to when you're an artistic person
00:23:15 It's you get into a habit of second-guessing yourself
00:23:18 Well, like a lot of a lot of it is like the stuff that I value was often vastly different from what my audience values, of course
00:23:24 Of course
00:23:26 And that's kind of the problem when you I value like a two-hour video of me
00:23:31 Fucking around my room in corpse paint talking about raping children eating
00:23:35 That's and that's going to go I'm looking forward to it
00:23:40 You know the I think we've mentioned him on the show before but the new storyteller
00:23:44 You know that guy who dresses up as Gumby and read stories when I was thinking of he's he's the cool
00:23:48 He makes like videos
00:23:50 Like they're they're borderline on watchable
00:23:52 But they're so charming because he's I think he's like got a mental problem
00:23:56 And he lives with his mother and he plays with Thomas the Tank Engine toys and reads stories allowed
00:24:01 But like really far from the camera, so you can't hear what he's saying and they're like hours long and he's like hundreds of videos
00:24:08 Something like three a day and each hour long like that's the average putting in the effort and it goes back to the whole autism thing
00:24:15 Like I'm so jealous of that guy because he's having the time of his life making all these videos that nobody's watching
00:24:20 Yeah, it's just it's that's the whole thing right
00:24:22 That's the trap because when you care about your audience and you care about your popularity or your reception of your content
00:24:28 Like you damn yourself to always being not satisfied
00:24:31 Which is why it's so dangerous to kind of go pro as an artist
00:24:35 As you're you're forcing yourself to be you know, what's the word subservient or or at the behest of of you know
00:24:42 An audience even even if they're just you know, your viewers
00:24:45 You feel pressures no matter what to to optimize what you're trying to do
00:24:49 Which is going to affect the kind of shit you want to produce for example
00:24:52 I don't think it is in at all smart for me to continue producing
00:24:56 Uh best anime ever is best game ever is in the way that I have been
00:25:00 It it's taken me months to get these out
00:25:02 There's no way I can keep doing it and achieve the kind of stuff
00:25:05 I want to so I'm gonna have to radically change my formula and I've already taken a bunch of steps to uh
00:25:10 To make that happen
00:25:11 So, you know, I think my my vision is gonna have to change if I want to be at all successful and frankly
00:25:16 I think we can all agree digital success is pissing me the fuck off
00:25:21 That's the topic that needs to be this. Let's thank god. He's not here. Yeah
00:25:25 Yeah, thank god. He sold out quit the procrastiners podcast to go beyond anthony fantano's podcast
00:25:30 He's going on the hollywood hogan podcast as we speak
00:25:34 Making me fucking say
00:25:36 Yeah, he was literally on anthony fantano's podcast
00:25:40 Man, he's um, yeah, we need to kill him. We need to we have to kill him. That's the only yeah, we decided
00:25:45 We've decided we either need to kill him or we need to like abuse his power and get him to show all of us
00:25:50 But you know, but you see no we're much more comfortable killing him because we don't want pity
00:25:54 We we rather forcibly take them. Yeah
00:25:56 It it it sickens me to think that the only time that I gain subscribers
00:26:03 is when digi
00:26:04 Promotes me in a video and I'm not saying that one of us recently. I'm not saying I want him to stop promoting me
00:26:10 But I'm saying that I'm sickened with myself for not wanting him to stop. I don't that was like a triple negative
00:26:17 Yeah, we know what you're saying. We we have to it's we have to kill
00:26:21 It's sad to think that we're all dependent on the one of us
00:26:24 But I don't I want to I want to I want to shield forever. I was I just want to well, you know
00:26:29 The loser but I think the thing about this is the most loser right digi totally has found his sweet spot
00:26:36 And he seems he seems pretty happy with the content he's making and he's working really hard at it and it's great
00:26:40 So for him, it's absolutely perfect. Um
00:26:43 Oh, excuse me, but you know, it's it's just frustrating for guys like us who
00:26:48 Are just more are more inclined to make to taking longer to make things
00:26:51 And I mean, I don't want I don't want to oversell myself like I fuck around
00:26:55 You know quite a bit as well. I could do things faster, of course
00:26:59 But like, you know, my my dream video isn't the same as digi's dream video
00:27:03 Like his his his asterisk war thing was absolutely beautiful for for youtube
00:27:08 I mean, even then we're probably took a little longer to make that
00:27:11 Yeah, the kind of content he wants to make is also just happens to be the kind of content that yeah
00:27:16 That's why he's so successful right now diminish his his intellectual ability to you know, make the right content
00:27:23 He's done it all intentionally. Look at his leaving pony
00:27:25 Like he reset his whole shit after vast success because you know, he wanted to succeed and he's done it
00:27:31 He's capitalized on it, but you know, it's just something that I'll never have in my work. I will never
00:27:36 Value what my audience values in the sleigh
00:27:39 Because yeah, yeah, you just got out once you're once you're above it like like the red letter media folks
00:27:45 They're just above that shit doesn't matter anymore. They'll just keep making a half of the bags
00:27:49 It's I mean, I'm not going to say that those are super easy to make but they make them for themselves
00:27:54 Seems pretty clear. They they do not take shit seriously
00:27:58 It's it's great. It'd be great to have a situation like that. Yeah, maybe one day
00:28:02 It's interesting that you say that you're at a point where you have to
00:28:06 Change up your style with the best guy ever and try to make it so that you can get them out faster
00:28:12 whereas
00:28:14 I've I've decided on like exactly the opposite solution. I see whereas I have
00:28:19 Stopped giving a fuck entirely
00:28:22 I've been releasing like
00:28:24 as the most random
00:28:26 Like I posted a tweet where like I posted like the screenshot of like my video history of the last couple months
00:28:31 And it's like all this random shit that has nothing to do with each other
00:28:35 Like, you know, I used to think like oh man, you know, if I try to give my channel a strong theme and make everything fit
00:28:41 And look nice together on the video page. I'll get more. I don't give a fuck anymore. Well, good. Good. That's the sound of sucking dick
00:28:47 Yeah, it's the sound of sucking dick. Exactly time to fucking
00:28:50 Jack in your ding dong
00:28:53 And I'm just I've just had it with that shit dong
00:28:56 Yeah, I am he got lost in a tragic accident just as we all know he's a pirate
00:29:00 So we had to replace the wooden dick. Well, you know, my father Gepetto. He taught me a lot of things
00:29:04 And the main thing he taught me was how to jack me wouldn't
00:29:07 do
00:29:11 I can't believe there's a Pinocchio porn of that up to this point
00:29:15 Exactly a lot of that tree sap comes up
00:29:19 And a mosquito gets caught in it and that's how I gave birth to the fucking
00:29:23 And that is how Jurassic Park happened a mosquito got trapped and Pinocchio's sap jizz
00:29:29 And 2,000 billion years later Jurassic Park takes place
00:29:34 Little wooden boy
00:29:38 We put in the extra effort on this joke. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Imagine sanding down that that
00:29:45 Sanding down
00:29:47 To make it all smooth. You know, I I I had to I had to just listen to my conscience. Mr. Jiminy Dickett
00:29:53 Came down
00:29:57 Mr. Jiminy Jacket
00:30:00 Ah
00:30:06 By the way, I have a bone to pick with you Gibbo
00:30:11 What happens last week when we did our amazing procrastineers dark soul race
00:30:17 And I revived the once-in-future legendary hero of Lordran
00:30:22 Uh, what's her name Anita?
00:30:26 I I I I said
00:30:28 Gib you gotta post the the original Anita's occasion video so that people have context for her adventures
00:30:35 Oh, you wanted to post it on procrastinators. Yeah, or you know, link it in the description and Gib
00:30:40 He didn't put in the effort to link
00:30:43 The original by that time I had looked off of the thing
00:30:46 Well, which means that the the viewers had no context. They didn't understand it
00:30:50 That some of the commenters got mad at me. They said I don't like Anita's occasion. I have no sense of humor
00:30:54 I think you're gay. I think you're fucking
00:30:57 I'm a misogynist and I hate women's, you know, you know, we have a lot of misogynists in our audience
00:31:02 Can we just address that? It's sad but true. It's sad but true. We need to we need to you know
00:31:07 Get rid of this toxicity. I've been thinking of pulling our comments all together from procrastinators
00:31:11 You know, it's just I'm not ready to subject innocent viewers to that level of hatred of hate speech
00:31:16 It's just find the comment section to be really problematic and that's right. You know, that's right. That's absolutely right
00:31:22 The like bar itself can't be trusted to have a strong progressive message that we need that that is really
00:31:29 I mean the point of the show the point of the show is to instill our social values and the people who listen. So, you know
00:31:35 Fuck you
00:31:37 That's what I'm trying to say
00:31:44 Um, yeah, what can we say that's related to the topic?
00:31:49 I don't know. I don't know
00:32:00 We didn't put off an upper up an effort into this
00:32:04 Well, no, okay. Here's here's a question then would you wrap like which we're talking about how digi's super successful
00:32:09 Doing what he does and how like we're not there and how we hate him
00:32:12 Yeah, and how we want looking for more success and the only reason I'm not as more successful than digi's because I've
00:32:18 Been working at university. So I haven't had time to make the amazing video the best videos of all time
00:32:24 Which is a decent excuse actually
00:32:26 And you've been your animations, which are great, which we are
00:32:29 I'm gonna become way bigger than digi's
00:32:31 Looking forward to it not to mention you also are like in talks. You're you're working with an actual animation studio now
00:32:38 We forgot to mention that gibbons the most successful really in the real he literally is the most successful
00:32:42 He's the most legit the most the most most
00:32:45 Normie in the good way s guy of us all and he's gonna he's gonna make us all wish we were dead soon enough the way digi does now
00:32:51 Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. Yeah, this guy. He's gonna be the next fucking the next rebecca sugar
00:32:56 He's the next alex hersch lauren foust. Yeah, whoever the fat hip man. He is who made adventure time
00:33:02 He's gonna try to make youtube videos
00:33:04 Imagine how hard it is to work in the studio where the man's trying to fuck you the whole time
00:33:10 Imagine producing something like like like steven universe in that environment, you know
00:33:14 Or or any kind of real show that involves so many people working together
00:33:18 That's a that's a whole animal that gibb's gonna get into and I man. I'm excited to hear more about it
00:33:23 Let's say once you're you know, did you meet with her recently? You got like a meeting coming up meeting with her tomorrow actually tomorrow
00:33:30 Oh, yeah
00:33:32 Well, this is the last time we'll see him on this podcast. He's yeah, he's moving up in the world
00:33:37 Forget about us
00:33:39 Me and nate sitting here like two gay idiots sucking on my beer bottle
00:33:46 It's too it's too cool to be praised for being the the cool guy
00:33:50 So I it's it's on the hollywood bound
00:33:54 Wow
00:33:55 I'm the cool moving with jon tron in hallywood. No no ego raptor. Yeah elmo raptor
00:34:01 So tom you were saying something we cut you off. What were you saying?
00:34:04 Well, my question was going to be like because we're all doing different things
00:34:07 And did you's being very successful doing what he's doing? I don't think any of us would do what he does
00:34:13 Mm-hmm. I'm I'm kind of sorting. I'm kind of planning to mimic him in his style. I mean it was successful
00:34:20 Um, but whatever I don't go on the question. I guess it's like would you rather be successful
00:34:25 Doing something you're just meh about would you rather?
00:34:28 Be kind of unknown doing something you have
00:34:31 Tons of personal
00:34:35 Is the question at the heart of being an artist
00:34:37 You don't need to make that much money to be alive all of my enemies die
00:34:41 Seeing them all driven before me. Yeah, the lamentation of the women. That's my true
00:34:46 Hence becoming the punisher. I mean what what are you gonna do if not just become uh, uh, I mean
00:34:53 It's not fair to describe him even as an anti hero because he's just a hero
00:34:56 A man who kills everyone who disagrees with his opinion
00:34:59 This this word anti hero this this anti hero meme needs to go away
00:35:04 I'm you know, just because you know, here's here's the thing people
00:35:09 Good people aren't always nice people and nice people aren't always good people
00:35:13 Sometimes you need a guy who's willing to cross those lines that the other cowards won't cross
00:35:19 You need a guy who's willing to do what needs to be done to clean up these fucking streets and wash away the filth
00:35:25 Once and for all that's choking the life
00:35:28 of this city
00:35:29 Even even by his own volition batman is not willing to take on the burden of being willing to murder people
00:35:34 To achieve his goal, but the punisher on the other hand that guy will do whatever it fucking shakes to get his shit straight
00:35:41 Fucking dirty harry any any guy who kills people is my hero
00:35:47 That's that's why I've never really liked batman. He's such a high horse faggot
00:35:51 He is he is a very high horse guy. I mean he he'll try to spook you
00:35:54 He'll spook you real good
00:35:56 I mean not to get too far off base, but I always thought it was interesting that they do that with batman
00:36:00 But they lately I think they present that as like a weakness like a character flaw almost what that's the core of the character
00:36:06 That was his yeah, I've been thinking about this ton. That's a good point. I hate that I hate
00:36:12 This trend of like cynicism and how superheroes are perceived or written
00:36:17 Where it's like like how they really should be killing people all the time like this trend of oh batman creates his villains
00:36:22 Batman, uh, he made them all worse. Yeah, what is that? Oh, yeah, you know what fuck you
00:36:26 Batman doesn't kill the joker because he's fucking batman. You know, he's a good guy
00:36:31 The whole point of batman is what makes him great is that he has suffered fucking trauma
00:36:37 He's emotionally traumatized. He has he's he's he's mentally ill and because of that
00:36:43 He takes pity on his mentally ill
00:36:46 Enemies, you know he Batman my batman is the guy you ever see that episode of the animated series with that
00:36:52 With that with baby doll
00:36:54 Yes, she's she's oh, yeah, yeah, of course. She's this midget. She's a dangerous. It's the saddest story ever told
00:36:59 She's a dangerous fucking criminal. She kills people. She shoots people
00:37:02 But at the end of the episode she breaks down because all this shit just happened because she's had a fucked up life
00:37:07 And what does batman do he doesn't punch her in the fucking nose
00:37:09 He holds her and he takes pity on her and he takes her to the fucking police station peacefully
00:37:14 That's why batman's a great hero and I'm sick and tired of this fucking this this cynical trend of well
00:37:19 If batman would just kill all of his bad guys that's deathly his batman because he doesn't
00:37:25 Man, I while we're talking I gotta bring up
00:37:27 I gotta bring up the greatest batman story of all time which is in the justice league
00:37:31 I don't know like unlimited where it's it's telling the future where it shows
00:37:35 Where his worst enemy that that fat black lady whatever her name was who was like his moral enemy
00:37:39 Holy shit. Yeah, where he he there's this there's this crazy psycho girl
00:37:44 Who's mutating the whole fucking world and like all of new york city is going to be fucking leveled if they don't stop her
00:37:49 And so he's like, okay, we need someone to go kill her. That's the only way to stop her
00:37:53 So, uh, she gives batman this he's like, I'll fucking do it. I'm gonna fucking end this. I'll do whatever it takes man
00:37:58 They're like damn batman you you crazy nigga get in there
00:38:01 So he goes in and this lady who can read minds this little this kid named ace leader of the royal flush gang
00:38:07 She goes in there and he's just like
00:38:09 If he just walks up to her and she's like, hey batman, he's like, yo, what's up girl?
00:38:13 And she's like so you came here to stop me and he's like, yep
00:38:16 And she's like you're gonna kill me and he's like nope just gonna be your friend, bro
00:38:19 And he just holds her hand. He just holds her hand while she dies
00:38:23 She's just because because she's like, oh man
00:38:25 My childhood was all fucked up by these asshole scientists nigga. It was fucking gay as hell dog
00:38:30 You know what that's like, you know what that's like, don't you bruce? And he's like, fuck. Yeah, I do exactly
00:38:35 And you know what the cynic the cynicism comes from is a critical misunderstanding of who batman is
00:38:41 Even his man enemy says that's the real batman. That's the guy, dude
00:38:45 Batman is not batman doesn't be batman for vengeance. He doesn't do it to hurt criminals
00:38:50 He does it to prevent crime to prevent other children from going through what he did
00:38:55 He's doing it to save victims not to kill people. You know, here's the thing. I fucking love the punisher
00:39:00 I love kasey jones. I love vigilantes who fucking kill people and i'm sure most people
00:39:05 Tend to agree with these characters that criminals should be fucking put down and killed
00:39:10 I certainly agree with it
00:39:11 But that doesn't mean that i'm going to apply that logic to batman because the basis of his character is an entirely different fucking philosophy
00:39:19 That is equally valid. You can't
00:39:21 It also seems like most of his villains are indeed insane
00:39:25 Uh, well, yeah, I mean, I mean you kind of happen to be insane
00:39:27 He doesn't even come up against like just asshole brutes who want to kill people
00:39:31 They're they usually fucked up themselves. Yeah, I mean his original enemy was like the mob, right?
00:39:36 And the mob is like an evil organization that sort of justifies our legitimately mentally ill
00:39:42 They need help. They don't need to be murdered. That's right. That's right
00:39:47 Well, what was that related to the batman podcast everybody put a lot of effort into that tangent
00:39:53 We did you know what I care a lot more about batman than I do about putting an effort into anything
00:39:57 Yeah, me too. Me too. Uh, what got us?
